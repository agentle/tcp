            TO THE READER.
            
               HEreis (good Reader) a litle Treatiſe of a great Argument, in the which (if euer in any) that may be ſeene, which doth daily come to paſſe, that the Book it ſelf doth nothing leſſe then performe that which the title doth promiſe and pretend: as we ſee and find often that the countenances of men do make a faire ſhew of many ſinguler vertues and excellent parts, which in triall are not to bee found in any part eyther of their ſoules or bodies. How then (may any and will ſome man ſay) do you of purpoſe go about to deceiue vs with gloſing titles, which haue vnder them no ſubſtance of matter? or were you your ſelues deceiued in taking in hand that which you were not able to accompliſh? Surely whatſo

we were, he hauing the truth plainly told him, and the fault reuealed, need not now be deceiued vnleſſe he will himſelfe, and then volenti nō fit iniuria: but for our parts wee did enterpriſe this conference, not in hope of ſoū
               ding the depth of this bottomeleſſe myſterie, but onely purpoſing to content our ſelues with that knowledge of it which is reuealed in the word of God. The which no doubt is moſt needfull, and alſo comfortable to all Chriſtians: for what eyther is or ſhall be our happines but the true knowledge and continuall contemplation of God? To the which purpoſe, if this Treatiſe do any whit further thee, we are glad: otherwiſe take our good will in good part. And ſo we commend the (good Reader) as we deſire to be commended by thee, to the gracious aſſiſtance of Gods holy ſpirit, to be by him inſtructed and preſerued in all truth.
         
         
            
            THE EPISTLE Dedicatorie.
            
               SIr, my dutie remembred vnto you, deſiring of God your welfare as heartely & more earneſtly, then I either do, or euer did mine owne. I had once purpoſed not to make any dedication of this litle pamphlet, that ſo none ſhould need to be troubled with it, ſaue only they (if there were any ſuch) that wold trouble themſelues with it. But the perſwaſions of ſome friends wiſhing that this litle bodie going abroad, might haue ſome head to direct it, haue preuailed ſo far, that I began to thinke of ſome friend with whom I might make ſo bolde as to vſe his name (at leaſt vnderstoode the whiche may ſerue for once, vnleſſe wee haue imitated that vnskilfull painter, who muſt needs ſet this epigramme ouer euery thing yt he painted: This is ſuch a thing) the forefront of this treatiſe, to giue to theſe fewe

ſheetes of paper, the name and title of a perfest booke, the which they doo ſo earneſtly affect. Wherevpon while I did bethinke my ſelfe of the reaſons and reſpects which vſually men follow in dedicating bookes, among the reſt (for there are diuers beſides) yet aboue the reſt (for they are the chiefe) theſe three came to minde, the first is neceſſarium, the ſecond vtile, and the third honeſtum. Neceſſitie maketh men (writing of matters not only greatly controuerted, but euen flatly contradicted, yea perhappes ſpightfully oppugned) as is almoſt euery trueth by one or other) ſhrowde themſelues vnder the authoritie & countenance of ſome great perſonage, that ſo they may haue ſhelter againſt the ſtormes and tempeſts, which their malitious enemies raiſe againſt their perſons, and the trueth which they do profeſſe. But this ſeemed not needfull for this treatiſe, which beeing rather a Philoſophical then a Theological diſcourſe, of the nature of God in general, wherin, not only all Chriſtians, but alſo the Iewes, yea the very Turkes and all other infidels doo agree, may ſafely trauel into any country without a ſafe-conduct, or arriue on any coaſt without a conuoy. The ſecond motiue is vtile, a Planet that now adaies raigneth by his powerfull influence in the very wils of men, (the which God himſelfe cannot compell) and is the Cynoſura or North ſtar, by whoſe aſpect moſt men lay their plots & courſes.

And ſurely men are not to bee blamed, if by this officious kinde of ſaluting and acknowledging the vertues of woorthie men (it beeing done without flatterie) they labor to procure vnto them deſerued fame & renowne, & to purchaſe to thēſelues ſome lawful fauor, as a recompence of their good affection. This may be done, yet it is more lawfull then commendable, for it is better to giue then to to take, and (in the opinion of ſome men) to want then to craue. The third reſpect, is the moſt honeſt and praiſe woorthie, for it hath an eye not to preſent ſafetie, or to future profit, but to benefites paſt and gone, and in a maner worne out of mind, the voluntarie acknowledging whereof, eſpecially before ſo many witneſſes, ſheweth a good nature, and a moſt ingenuous minde. Here I did ſet down my ſtaffe, as minding out of this companie to make my choiſe, yet was I not as yet come to my iourneyes end: for as wee all haue many benefactours, to whom wee are much indebted, ſo it may bee doubted, which of them may by beſt right challenge this dutie to himſelfe. Our beſt benefactour is hee, from whom onely commeth euery good and perfect gift, who hath enriched vs both with temporall and with ſpirituall bleſsings, and therefore doth moſt woorthely deſerue to bee honoured aboue all others, with the firſt and beſt of all the things we haue.
            
               
And without question, the zeale and good affection of thoſe men, who (euen in this our age) in thankfulneſſe to God the giuer of all knowledge and wiſedome, haue made him and no other, the Patrone of their bookes and labours, yea though they were not directly written of his nature, deſerueth highly to bee praiſed: yet me thinkes as it is not lawfull to giue to man, the honors which are due and proper to God, ſo it ſoundeth ſomewhat harſh (though in trueth it bee not euill, and to bee condemned as ſimply vnlawfull) to giue thoſe honours to God, which are commonly beſtowed on men: and therefore euen the godlieſt men haue thought it moſt meete to dedicate their bookes to men like to themſelues, and themſelues both bodie and ſoule to God. So then we muſt deſcend to humane benefactours, of all which wee muſt acknowledge the publick Patrons & fathers of our countrie, to bee as moſt beneficiall to vs (howſoeuer the enuie which men bear to the good one of another, maketh common benefites not to bee eſteemed) ſo moſt worthie, to whom in the firſt place all honour, loue and dutie, ſhould bee performed both by this, and by all other meanes whatſoeuer. Yet wee are not to ſtay here, for tho publicke perſons be to be preferred, yet priuate duties muſt not bee neglected: the which thing the very heathen did ſee by the light of nature, and therefore aſſoone as they had ended their publicke

ſeruices and ſacrifices to the publicke Gods of their countries and cities, they did without faile look homewards & carefully (thogh ſuperſtitiouſſly & fooliſhly) honor with due rites and ceremonies their deos penates, their houſhold Gods. Neither did they herein think their publike gods to bee iniured or diſhonoured: for being (though fondly) perſwaded that they receiued much good euen from their priuate Gods, herevpon they inferred as a moſt vndoubted trueth, which no man endued with common ſence would deny, that whoſoeuer was ſufficient to beſtowe benefites on men, the ſame was ſufficient to receiue honor and thanks at the hands of men. And in very truth, he that would make a ſeparation & diuorce betwixt the beſtowing of benefits, and the receiuing of thankes, hee ſhould go about to take heate from the fire, light from the ſunne, and all ſence of humanitie out of the hearts, and from the ſocieties of men. But howſoeuer this dutie of thankfulneſſe ought moſt religiouſly to bee performed, yet wee ſee that none is more prophanely neglected: eſpecially towards thoſe, to whome in reſpest of neare coniunction of nature, we owe double loue and dutie: but they what good ſoeuer they doo to vs, ſerue thankleſſe Maisters, whereas wee knowe that Idolatrous and vniuſt Laban could ſay to Iacob, Though thou bee my near kinſman, yet it is no reaſon, that thou ſhouldſt ſerue for

nought, and be defrauded of the wages due vnto thee. And now at length to come to our purpoſe, I do moſt willingly confeſſe (as I would more willingly haue done long ere this, if it had pleaſed you to accept that homage, which I thinke you could bee content ſtill to ſpare) that if euer any man might of an other, then may you of me expect and require all thankefulneſſe of minde, all thankſgiuing in word, and all actuall teſtification of it by this or by any other means, whatſoeuer is or may at any time lie in mee to performe. Your title is as good as is his (who hauing with great expence purchaſed the feeſimple of a faire and fruitefull Orchard, and enioying it in quiet poſſeſſion for many yeares togither, no man making any claime to it, or to any part or parcel of it, or once offering to ſet eyther foote or face into it: yea planting it with the beſt trees that could be had, and not ſuffering them to growe wilde, and to bring foorth ſower fruite, but pruning and lopping them (yet almoſt ſo as it is ſaid of Dauid, 1. King. 1. 6.) and grafting them with the beſt ſciences that could be had eyther at home or in forrein countreys) to take and taſte an apple of ſome tree in this his own Orchard. If you ſhould ſay, the which I am perſwaded you did neuer thinke, that this were a deare apple, and a ſory recompence for ſo great coſt and care: Indeed I muſt confeſſe, that you might haue bought ten thouſand ſuch bookes

with leſſe charges, yet we ſee this to be the courſe of the world, that when as men haue moſt extreamly both charged and toyled themſelues in planting Orchards & ſetting Gardens, yet if they do but taſte of the fruite of the one, and ſmell of a flower of the other, they thinke that they haue enough for their mony, and are better apaid, then if they had had giuen thē a thouſand cart-loads of any other (though farre better) eyther fruite or flowers. For all things are not to bee esteemed by profit, or to bee numbred by Arithmeticall, but rather to bee waighed by Geometricall proportion, which is the better: and truly I haue alwaies thought, and ſo it may be, that many others thinke, that you do make more account of a publicke good, (the which happely euen theſe ſmall treatiſes may procure more or leſſe) then of a great deale of your priuate profit: As I haue often heard you ſay, that you thought it meete that the firſt borne ſhould bee dedicated to the ſtudie of Diuinitie and the ſeruice of God according to the equitie of Moſes lawe made to that effect, the which ought ſtil to remaine in ſome ſort, though it do not neceſſarely binde.
            And therefore inſtead of a better teſtimonie of a thanking, yet more thankfull minde, I am bolde to ſend vnto you, togither with a little treatiſe of repentance, for the which you wrote in your laſt letter, another of the ſame pitch and ſtature, beeing

his younger brother, to accompanie him. It is needleſſe I knowe, to vſe many or any wordes, in commending them to you, Nepotesauis, quam filij patribus chariores eſſe ſolent: Admit them I pray you into your familie, as did olde Iacob, Ephraim and Manaſſes, the ſonnes of Ioſeph, and let your name bee named vpon them. Yea, if you pleaſe, lay your hands vpon them, in peruſing thē as your leiſure will permit. Yet do not imitate him in croſsing his hands, and in preferring the latter before the former, (for hee was by the extraordinarie ſpirit of prophecie, priuiledged to croſſe his hands, and with all the lawe of God, yea which is more, becauſe they are more the lawes of God, the lawes of nature, and of nations) for the former is fitter for your purpoſe, and will bee more profitable for you, ſo much as the true practiſe of Chriſtianitie, ſet downe in ſome ſort in that treatiſe of repentāce, is to be preferred before naked ſpeculation, to the which kinde I muſt needs confeſſe that this latter treatiſe doth more properly belong. I do heartely wiſh and earneſtly deſire of God, that as you haue been the means of exiſting to them, ſo they may returne vnto you in way of thankfulneſſe, ſome ſpirituall good, the one for practiſe, which is the better part, and the other for knowledge, which is not to bee neglested. Neither do I doubt, but that God wil in ſome meaſure heare my prayer, with whom nothing is more

righteous and pleaſing, then that euery one ſhould reape the fruites of his labours, eſpecially of their godly indeuours which do directly tend to the good of his Church: you haue ſowen the ſeede, and therfore may wel take the crop into your barne, you haue both planted and grafted the tree, and why then ſhould another plucke away the fruite? It would (perhappes) haue been more profitable, if according to the common courſe of the world, I had by this dutie worſhipped the ſunne, not occidentem (for who regards the ſun any longer th
                  •
               n they ſee the light and feele the heate of it) but Orientem, whoſe benefits are not in the paſt but in the future tenſe. And yet as it hath pleaſed God hitherto to make you the onely meanes (in a maner) of profit vnto me (I ſpeake of priuate benefactours) euen from my cradle and firſt infancie to this preſent houre, yea ſo that you doo not yet faile or faint, (as you might well haue done ſince you began, without any blame) but that your laſt & late benefits & bountie do exceed the former: ſo if I were ſo minded as to vſe mai
                  ••
               er vtile for my Pilot, and the directer of my ſhip and courſe, I know no cauſe why I might not hope to haue as good a Chapman of you, as of another. So then, both honeſtum and vtile haue giuen their voyces to this choice, to the which if neceſsitie could be brought to giue his aſſent, then it were done vnanimi conſenſu, without any gain ſaying: and

ſurely in my minde he is not hard to be intreated. Pompey ſurnamed the great, for his great conqueſts and triumphs, (although hee might more truly be ſo called for the greatneſſe of his minde and vertues) being ſent by the Senate into one of their Prouinces, would needs take ſhippe and ſea in a great tempeſt, ſaying: It is needfull that I ſhould go, becauſe it is needfull that I ſhould diſcharge my dutie, but not that I ſhould liue: and ſo wee are to account it more needfull to auoyde the foule crime of ingratitude, then to haue eyther our writings, or perſons ſafely protected. I may not though I would, trouble you any further: it remaineth onely that I deſire God to returne ſeuen fold into your boſome, as I doubt not but that hee will doo, eyther in this or in a better life) all that good which you haue done vnto me: and ſo leauing you in the moſt ſure protection of God, in whom I am perſwaded that you truſt, I take my leaue till further occaſion bee offered, eyther of writing or of comming vnto you.
            The Lord bee with you.

                     ELL ouertaken Syr.
                  
                  
                     Schol.
                     You are welcome Gentleman.
                  
                  
                     Gent.
                     No great Gentleman ſir, but one that wiſheth well to all that meane well: I pray you, how farre doo you trauell this way?
                  
                  
                     Sch.
                     As farre as Yorke.
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     Gent.
                     I ſhould be glad, if I might haue your company thither.
                  
                  
                     Sch.
                     And I, if my company might ſtand you in any ſteed: but howſoeuer it be, you may command it: and by vouchſafing me the benefit of your company, maketh me much beholden to you.
                  
                  
                     Gent.
                     Not ſo ſir: but without queſtion, the company of men of your profeſſion, is both pleaſant and profitable, & much to be deſired for the attaining of knowledge & wiſdome.
                  
                  
                     Sc.
                     I pray you ſir, whō do you take me to be?
                  
                  
                     Gent.
                     Surely, it ſhould ſeeme by your apparell, that you are a Scholer, or ſome Miniſter.
                  
                  
                     Sch.
                     Indeed, if you call a learner a Scholler, I do confeſſe my ſelfe to be of that profeſſion: but if (as I ſuppoſe) you meane by a Scholler, not a learner, but a teacher, or Doctor, one able to inſtruct, and direct others, you take your markes amiſſe: for (as we ſ
                           •
                        y in the Schooles) Cucullus nonfacit monac huum.
                     
                  
                  
                     Gent.
                     I meane by a Scholler, not one that learnes his ABC, or his Accidens, but a Student, one that hath bene brought vp in learning in ſome Vniuerſitie: able with a little labour, and in a ſhort time, to do much good to vs that are ignorant. In this ſence I am perſwaded, that you are, and may be both called and accounted a Scholler.
                  
                  
                     
                     Sch.
                     It pleaſeth you ſir, of your gentleneſſe, to thinke and ſpeake of me, farre better then I do deſerue: but if it were, as you do weene, and wiſh, yet I know no cauſe, but that I both may and ought, looke for profit and encreaſe of knowledge, as well at your hands as you at mine.
                  
                  
                     Gen.
                     Why that cānot be: you giue your ſelues continually to reading, and all other meanes of attaining knowledge: whereas we follow other matters, and ſpend our dayes about worldly profits or pleaſures, as our callings, places and degrees do require.
                  
                  
                     Sch.
                     The more is the pittie if it be ſo: you (for the moſt part) haue leiſure inough to ſeek knowledge: yea you are of abilitie to prouide for your ſelues, all things belonging vnto ſtudie, the which Schollers do often wāt, to their great grief and hinderāce. And ſurely (in my mind) it were far more commendable and honorable, for men of wealth, place, & accoūt, to purſue and huntafter knowledge and wiſedome, by the which they might benefit much their countrey, both Church, and Commonwealth, then to ſpend their time and goods, in vaine and vnprofitable pleaſures.
                  
                  
                     Gent.
                     You ſay true ſir, in the opinion of the wiſeſt: but for this time, we will rather take it as we find it, thē diſpute how it oght to be: if you looke for any great learning at my hands,

you are deceiued, and will in the ende be diſappoynted. Yet I pray you, let vs paſſe the time and way in ſome good conference, and giue me leaue to aske your opinion and he
                           •
                        p in ſome poynts of diuinitie, whereof I either am altogither ignorant, or elſe doo greatly doubt, and would gladly be reſolued. It wold without queſtion bee a great eaſe, and make that wee ſhould neither fee
                           •
                        e the weariſomeneſſe of our tedious trauell, nor yet complain or crie out of the length of theſe Northumberland myles: yea I do not doubt, but it wil be profitable to vs both: for I ſhall be inſtructed, and you by calling to remembrance your former reading, ſhall imprint it more deeply into your minde, and haue it more readie againſt an other time.
                  
                  
                     Sch.
                     Indeed conference is alwaies good, and eſpecially in trauell: yea, and for the matter of our conference, you haue choſen the better part, in that you had rather beſtow the time in ſome poynts of diuinitie, whereby we may be edified in religion, and in the knowledge of God, then ſpend it in other matters, which are either vaine & needleſſe, or at the leaſt, not comparable vnto it, either in vſe or excellencie. Yet I muſt needs tell you plainly, that you are too careful of your owne eaſe,

in that you would laye the whole burthen of anſwering all queſtions, and reſoluing all doubts vpon my ſhoulders, and ſhift it wholly from your ſe
                           •
                        f. You know, that it is the cuſtome, and as it were, a lawe among trauellers, not to put any one continually to the trouble of ſeeking and leading the way, but to do it by courſe. And therefore I may not agree to this motion which you haue made, vnleſſe it pleaſe you to accept theſe two conditions: firſt, that you giue me the like libertie, in propoūding to you thoſe doubts which trouble me, and be content to ſhewe mee the like fauour, in helping mee out of the briers wherein I ſhall ſtick. Secondly, that in hard and intricate queſtions, that anſwere bee accepted for the time which may bee had: for it is a plain caſe, that any one mā may moue moe queſtions in an houre, then all the learned men in the world can aunſwere and reſolue, all the daies of their liues.
                  
                  
                     Gent.
                     Your conditions are very reaſonable, & althogh my anſwering of your doubts wil be, as the prouerbe is, Sus mineruam, (in the which reſpect, and not in any partiall fauour of my ſelf, as you do charge me, I referred the matter wholly to your diſpoſitiō) yet for ſo much as you giue others beſide Schollers,

                     VVEll, well: let vs leaue theſe things, and come to the purpoſe: yet for all this haſt, one thing I muſt needs deſire of you, and it is this. That you would not bee offended, nor yet thinke ſcorne to aunſwere and reſolue me, euē in thoſe queſtions, which are moſt certaine, manifeſt, and without all queſtion, as if I ſhould deſire to bee reſolued of this poynt, that there is a God, that made and ruleth, and gouerneth al things. Not that I doubt of this, or any other maine poynt of Chriſtian religion, but that I may knowe and hold that more firmly, which I doo alreadie both beleeue, and alſo know in part.

                     Wee cannot, if wee ſpeake properly, call this a poynt of Chriſtian religion, for all the heatheniſh religions that euer were, or that are at this day in the world, agree in this, as in the foundation and ground wheron they reſt, that there is a God, for otherwiſe there could be no religion. Yet you ſay verie true, that our knowledge both in this, and in all other poynts concerning God, is vnperfect: and therefore we may lawfully, yea we muſt

neceſſarily labour for an increaſe of it, and for that Pleerophoria, that is, a ful knowledge and certaine perſwaſion, mentioned in Scripture. Yea, if you pleaſe, we will beginne with this poynt, for that (if it muſt needs be handled, as it is ſeldome, it beeing ſeldome called into queſtion) it ought to haue the firſt place aſſigned vnto it.

                        rnement, but rather extreame confuſion in the world, that things came to paſſe not by any prouidence or power of God, but partly by the force and efficacie of naturall cauſes, working according to the ordinarie and ſet courſe of nature, and partly by the inclinations, deuiſes, conſultations and purpoſes of men, proceeding from the free motion of their owne minds and wils: that fooliſh and ſuperſtitious people did aſcribe many things, as warre, dearth, famine, plague, ſickneſſe, pouertie, and many other caſualtie
                           •
                        , to ſome extraordinarie worke of God, which the wiſe did plainly ſee to come by the ordinarie connexion and conſequence of naturall cauſes: that as touching thoſe fewe who did wholly depend and relye themſelues vppon God, and did daily and hourely call vppon him for ſuch things as they ſtood in neede of, it happened to them no better: yea, for the moſt part, farre woorſe then to the wicked: that for all their faith and prayers, they muſt either betake

themſelues to the ordinarie courſe of the world, or elſe vtterly periſh and miſcarrie: that many who moſt outragiouſly blaſpheme, yea openly both denie & defie God, (as wee read of a certaine Pope, who ſaid that hee would haue and eate of a meate that hee fancied, in deſpite of God, and ſo he did) proſper and fare as well, yea much better, then they that ſerue him moſt deuoutly: that there were not to be ſeene in the world, any arguments of Gods power and preſence, nor any thing which might make a wiſe man wonder: whereas in all reaſon, it ſhould ſeeme more poſsible to hide the ſunne, being aboue our horizon, ſo that it ſhould not either by heate, beames, light, or anie other meanes, ſhewe it ſelfe to bee preſent, then that God ſhould be in the world, and yet no way apparant.
                     As for the Scripture out of the which we vſe ſo plainly to teach, proue, and demonſtrate the beeing of God, as out of his onely euidences, that there was no certanitie could bee had of anie thing contained in it: that euerie Kingdome, Countrie, and Cittie, yea almoſt euerie priuate man, did gather out of it a diuers and different 
                           •
                        orme of religion and ſeruing GOD:

that many things in it might bee prooued to be falſe and fabulous, as of the flames of Purgatorie, the fire of Hell, and the light of heauen, prepared and appoynted for the ſoules of men departing from their bodies, according as they had liued in this world, either well or elſe wickedly: that all theſe doctrines, and infinit others of the ſame kinde, were but counterfeit, and both deuiſed and vſed to keepe people in ſome awe and order: yea (which ſeemed woorſt of all) that the Scripture was contradicted not onely by others, but alſo by it ſelfe in many poynts and places, whereas in truth, there is not any diſcord or harſh iarring, but a moſt ſweete and full conſort and harmonie. So that for theſe reaſons and diuers other, that I will not trouble you with, me thought I might ſay of God, as Elias ſaith of Baal, that in all likelihood hee was either a ſleepe, or in bat tell, or about ſome waightie affaires, or (as he thought and mentindeed) no where exiſting, yet theſe doubts were but as flying cloudes in my minde, which the glorie, maieſtie, and truth of God, ſhining both in his word and worke, as clearely as the ſunne doth at noone day, did ſoone diſſolue, yet not ſo, that you ſhould thinke it loſt labour to ſpeake ſomewhat to that effect,
                  
                  
                     
                     Sch.
                     I may for faſhions ſake, but I am perſwaded, that it is in a manner needleſſe, and that you are not now to learne, how that God, hauing reuealed himſelfe ſufficiently by diuers euident meanes, doth now in a manner hide and abſent himſelfe from the world, yea euen from his church and choſen people, and that vpon good ground, in reſpect both of the elect, and of the reprobate. Firſt for the elect, we knowe that in the firſt ages of the world, God did reueale himſelfe vnto them by many meanes, which now he hath laid aſide, as firſt in ſenſible apparitions, viſions, voyces, and dreames, yea ſometimes in as plaine and familiar manner, as men vſe to talke and conuerſe with their frends, face to face, without any colours, ſhewes or vizards. Secondly, God did vſually beſtow vpon his ſeruants many temporall bleſsings, and powre foorth vpon the wicked, greeuous plagues and puniſhments. This was done in reſpect of the infancie and weake eſtate of the Church and the godly, who being as yet indued but with a ſmall meaſure of knowledge and faith, (the time beeing not come, wherein the miſterie of eternall ſaluation in Chriſt, was to be vnfolded) would ſoone haue fallen into diſtruſt and forgetfulneſſe of God, if that he had beene ſtraunge with them: and

therfore it pleaſed him in mercie to viſit them often in this ſencible manner of bodily apparitions, and of temporall bleſsings, that ſo he might (as it were) keep his acquaintance with thē, the which otherwiſe wold ſoon, by reaſon of that ſmall meaſure of ſpirituall graces which they had, haue beene forgotten and come to nought. But now in this time of the Goſpell, wherein ſpirituall graces are plentifully giuen, and eternall glorie ſo certainely promiſed to the faithfull, yea euen poynted at with the finger, as being hard at hand, and almoſt in ſight, ſhould God ſtill dandle them in in his lap with temporall bleſsings, as with lakings to toy and playe with? and ſtill appeare in viſible maner, as if the Goſpell could not be, either for doubtfulneſſe beleeued, or for obſcuritie vnderſtood? We ſee that when as children are growne vp to any ſtature and ſtrength, they are not onely aſhamed, once to thinke of ſucking the dug againe, but alſo are by painfull toyle & labor continually exerciſed, for the increaſe both of ſtrength in their bodies, and of patience in their minds, howſoeuer it bee greeuous vnto them, and make them doubt of the loue of their parents, by whom they are tied to ſo vnwelcome a taske.
                     
                        
In like manner it pleaſed God to deale with his children, not only in withdrawing frō thē theſe temporall toies, (yet not leauing them comfortleſſe, who haue both plentie of ſpirituall graces in preſent fruition & the inſtant hope of eternall glorie, wherewith to ſolace themſelues) but alſo in exerciſing their faith, hope, patience, and loue, by continuall trials and temptations, croſſes and afflictions, as if he had clean forgotten thē, and caſt them off for euer. Wheras indeed he doth it onely for the triall and commendation of their faith; which by this meanes is found to be firme and ſound, euen as gold is tried by the fire. For if whenſouer wee are pinched with any griefe, miſerie, or want, God were ſtraightway at our elbowes, with comfort and with ſuch things as wee deſire, either for neceſsitie or pleaſure, what great matter were it to depend vppon him, and to loue him. The moſt blockiſh ſot in the world, would truſt that which he ſeeth with his eies: and there is no brute beaſt in the world of ſo ſauage a nature, but would beare good affection to him, that did daily ply him with good and pleaſant things, one in the necke of another, neither is it poſsible for a man to hope for that which hee alreadie hath.
                     
                        
But when as by faith and hope, we take ſuch hold of God and the promiſes of eternall life, that no temptations can make vs let our hold go: when as in the moſt bitter afflictions we feele the ſweet taſte and relliſh of the loue of God, when as wee doo ſteadfaſtly beholde that which is far out of ſight, then is our faith found to be not baggage droſſe, but pure and precious gold, fit for the ſeruice of the king of heauen. Thus Chriſt ſpeaketh vnto Thomas, Ioh 2. 20. 29. Thou haſt ſeene, felt, and therevpon doeſt beleeue, that I am riſen from the dead, but bleſſed are they that do notſee, or feele, and yet beleeue: that is, their faith is more ſtrong and excellent, and therefore their ſaluation and bleſſedneſſe more certaine. Likewiſe in reſpect of the wicked, it is needfull, that God ſhould by deferring thoſe plagues, that their blaſphemies and other outragious ſinnes, do deſerue, ſuffer thē to go on in hardning their hearts, and in filling vp the meaſure of their ſinne. For if they ſawe God preſent in the world in temporall plagues, giuing to euery ſinne the deſe

As for the multitude of falſe religions, and the great diuerſitie of opinions among thoſe that proſeſſe the trueth, what is that to the purpoſe? The pathway of trueth is one and the ſame, by-wares are infinit: the ignorance, errors, and hereſies of men, cannot preiudice the ſubſtance & foundation

of it) ſafe and ſound in the Church, Laſtly, for the contradictions and vntrueths wherewith the holy Scripture is charged, if the ſpirit of God had vſed in penning the Scripture, we

But we know that there is nothing falſe in the Scripture if be rightly vnderſtood, and that all the parts of it haue a moſt perfect agreement & conſonancie with the other, the Lawe with the Goſpell, the ceremonies of Moſes, with the ſubſtance in Chriſt: the Prophets with the Apoſtles, and each one with other. But I maruell why you ioyne the fire of Purgatorie, whereat now the whole world doth laugh; as at a moſt ridiculous toy, with hell and heauen, wherby in Scripture is ment the miſerie of the wicked, and the happineſſe of the godly in the life to come: both which wee cannot doubt, but that God that hath ſpoken it, will accompliſh and make manifeſt vnto vs.

                     I Was alwaies (I thanke God) of that minde, & yet you haue reſolued me of diuers poynts whereof before I doubted. Now that you haue taken away theſe doubtes and ſcruples, and weeded out theſe bitter rootes of vnbeleefe, which make many depart away from the liuing God, it is meete that you ſhould ſowe ſome new ſeeds of faith in the minde, by ſetting downe ſome manifeſt proofes, demonſtrations, and euidences of God, by the which he may be certainly knowne, yea in a manner ſeene and felt.
                  
                  
                     Sch.
                     That is no hard mater to doo, for ſomuch as there is nothing in the world, which doth not affoord vs an euident teſtimonie of God, who euen in the leaſt things, much more in thoſe which are by nature excellent, is moſt wonderfull and moſt apparant. But to auoyde confuſion as welin my ſpeech, as in your memorie, we wil reduce the infinit teſtimonies of God to theſe fiue heads: the firſt are the creatures: the ſecond is the light of nature: the third is the word of God: the fourth is his ſpirit: and the laſt are his miracles or extraordinarie workes. All theſe togither, will be

vnto vs a cloude of witneſſes, euen an infinit number compaſsing vs round about, and ſo by their huge multitude in a manner darkening the ſunne, or rather ſo inlightning our mindes, that there cannot any darke cloudes of doubting or diſtruſt remaine. Firſt then to beginne with the creatures in the which God did firſt manifeſt himſelfe, who can either denie or doubt, but that the heauens declare the glorie of God, & the firmament ſheweth his handie worke: and that if God made not them, yet they made their maker whoſoeuer he were, to be moſt iuſtly and woorthily called and accounted God, in that they moſt plainly witneſſe his ſurpaſsing power, wiſedome, and maieſtie.
                     If the creatures themſelues, as namely the ſunne, moone, and ſtarres (yea many earthly creatures, which in reſpect of theſe are baſe and contemptible, yet haue been taken and worſhipped for gods) are in thēſelues ſo glorious, that they haue extorted from many nations, the names, titles, and worſhippe of God, it cannot be but that they ſhould euen lead vs by the hand, to acknowledge the glorie and God head of him, who was their deuiſer and maker, and doth ſtill continue their preſeruer.
                     Nowe if wee deſcend into this lower

worlde, wherein wee dwell, and there beginne with our ſelues, called by the Philoſophers not without cauſe, litle worlds, we ſhall finde both without in our bodies, in the moſt cunning and curious forme and frame of them, and within in our mindes and ſoules, in their manifold faculties and effects, ſo plain and pregnant arguments of ſo great wiſedome and power, that wee ſhall ceaſe to maruell, how Alexander the great, and Nabuchadnezar the proude, came to that paſſe, to ſuppoſe thēſelues to be not men but Gods, and ſhall beginne to maruell why all the men in the world are not of their opinion, vntill we be thinke our ſelues, that men ſee plainely both in themſelues and in others, that they did not make themſelues, but were made by an other. Yet may not man boaſt or brag, that this prerogatiue of bringing in euidence for the deitie of his maker, is peculiar to himſelf: he muſt be faine to admit into the participation of this praiſe, all the other creatures in the world: not onely thoſe which excel himſelfe in greatnes, ſtrength, ſwiſtnes, ſharpnes of ſence, and in many other reſpects, but euen the baſeſt & ſillieſt worme that ſcrawleth vppon the ground: yea (which may make him lay downe his peacocke taile, and bee quite out of conceit with himſelfe) hee muſt in this

reſpect giue place euen to ſenceleſſe things, as to hearbs, trees, and ſtones: the vertues and operations whereof (hidden in the cauſes, to the ſharpeſt wittes of the moſt ſubtile Philoſophers, yet manifeſt in the effects, to the blunteſt ſences of the moſt ſimple ideots) if they bee as duly conſidered as they are daily ſeene, will in a manner turne men into ſtones: ſo amazing them, that they will bee conſtrained to renounce all naturall reaſons, and to acknowledge that it is the finger of GOD.
                     And ſo for concluſion of this poynt, not onely they that go downe into the deepe ſecrets of naturall Philoſophie, but euen ſuch alſo as do onely ſwimme and floate aloft in the ſuperficiall conſideration of the frame of the whole world, and of the particular creatures therein contained, doo manifeſtly beholde, and muſt of neceſsitie acknowledge the wonderfull power and wiſedome of God.
                     And no maruell, when as the very heathen who are purblinde, if not ſtone-blinde in reſpect of God, haue in this cleare Chriſtall glaſſe of the creatures eaſily deſcried, and plainely diſcerned the portrature and image of God. Againſt whoſe teſtimonie, which now in the ſecond

place is to bee produced) although there might exception be takē, in reſpect of the particulars, for that in matters of religion, heathen men are of no credit or account, both deceiuing others, and beeing deceiued themſelues, by following lies and illuſions, yet in reſpect of the vniue

                     I am ſure you haue often heard and read, that 
                           Ʋox populi (much more then Vox mundi) eſt vox Dei: many may bee deceiued, but that is taken for trueth, wherein all generally do agree: for ſuch things are not deuiſed by this or that man, but ingrauen in the minde of man by nature her ſelfe, and therefore are to bee accounted true and certaine, eſpecially by Atheiſts, who make Nature their God.
                     Yea beſides the ordinarie meanes of the light of nature, by the which all men naturally and generally attaine the vndoubted perſwaſion of this trueth, it hath pleaſed God in all ages and places to maintaine it, and put it out of all doubt by extraordinarie workes, of the which all prophane ſtories affoord plentifull examples.
                     But wee haue a clearer light to direct vs in this, and in all other caſes

of controuerſie, then is the dimme light of nature, to wit, the word of God contained in the bookes of holy ſcripture, ſo full of diuine wiſedome, that wee cannot once imagine it to haue beene hatched by the braine of man, angell, or other creature whatſoeuer.
                     To let all other arguments paſſe, which the ſcripture doth affoord vs for this purpoſe, let vs but conſider in it how God hath dealt with his Church from time to time, alwaies preſeruing it in ſome one corner or other, y

then by inward aſſurance, more certaine then ſence: firſt by ceremonies, then by the ſubſtance of his worſhip: firſt by tipes, then by the trueth: firſt by the ſhadow, then by the bodie it ſelfe: firſt by prophecies, then by accompliſhments: and laſtly, firſt by the image and counterfeit, and then by the very perſonall preſence of Chriſt himſelfe, bringing vnto vs in his Goſpel, that conſummatum eſt, that yea and amen, euen all in all, and all at once. For who knoweth not, that in the doctrine of the Goſpell, we haue vnfolded vnto vs ſuch endleſſe treaſures of diuine wiſedome, that (euen by the iudgement of thoſe who are not affected with any loue towards it, and therefore cannot be ſuſpected of partiallitie) all the religions of the heathen are in compariſon of it moſt childiſh, ridiculous, and trifling toies. The fourth meanes by the which God is reuealed and made knowne to man, is proper to the faithfull, to wit, the inward and ſecret operation of his ſpirit, renewing their minds and hearts to know and loue the trueth.
                     This light farre paſſeth all the other, for that it not onely ſhineth in the eyes, as the other do, but alſo openeth them, that they may ſee and beholde the trueth, which thing, the other are not able to effect.
                     
                        
For although wee cannot imagine any more plaine and euident proofes of the deitie, then the three aforeſaid meanes: namely the creation and preſeruation of the world, the generall aſſent and voice of all the Nations vnder heauen in al ages, eſpecially of the lewes, who doo generally abhorre this opinion of Atheiſme: and laſtly, the doctrine of the Goſpell, wherein the whole will and counſell of God is fully and finally reuealed, by ſome or all whereof, many are broght to acknowledge God, and to haue although not a full ſight, yet a glimmering of him: yet notwithſtanding all theſe meanes, wee ſee that many remaine in the palpable blindneſſe of Atheiſme, neither knowing in minde, nor acknowledging by word, any other God, then the ordinarie and ſet courſe of nature, becauſe as yet their eyes are faſt ſhut and ſealed vp: ſo that they cannot ſee the light, although it be moſt cleare. But the ſpirit of God is that oyntment, Ioh. 2. 20. which openeth our eyes, and maketh vs cleare ſighted: ſo that now it fareth with vs, as with that man, Ioh. 9. 1. that hauing beene borne blinde (had no doubt) often heard men ſpeak of the Sunne, and the light thereof, and did beleeue it to bee ſo, yet not without ſome doubting, & not at all knowing what to make

of it, or wherunto to reſemble it. But aſſoone as his eyes being opened, he did plainly beholde the Sunne, with the light and beames thereof, he did no more doubt of the Sunne, then he did of himſelfe, and of his owne beeing: ſo men before they bee enlightned by Gods ſpirit, they ſee little or nothing of the glory of God, which after regeneration, is as cleare vnto them as the Sunne at mid-day, euen as we read, 2. Kin. 6. 17. that Eliſeus his ſeruant could not ſee the huge armie of horſmen and chariots, which was hard at hand, till ſuch time, as God, at the prayer of the Prophet opened his eyes. The fift and laſt means, by the which God is made knowne, are his extraordinary and miraculous works, by the which he hath reuealed himſelf, not onely to ſome fewe of his ſeruāts, who haue bin the inſtruments by whom they haue bin wrought, but alſo in the eyes of the world, beholding them. And without queſtion, when theſe are added to the former, they bring with them, to the true beleeuers, euen a huge heape of faith, and aſſurance, howſoeuer to carnall vnbeleeuers, they are often vaine and of no effect. For if vnto that knowledge of God which we haue by the creatures and the light of nature, by his word and ſpirit, God ſhould adde ſuch immediate reuelations, familiar

conferences, viſible apparitions, & ſencible viſions, ſuch ſignes & wonders as he wroght in olde times in and by his ſeruants, we could not but by theſe meanes bee much more vndoubtedly perſwaded of the power, preſence, and prouidence of God, then now we are, howſoeuer the wicked did ſtill continue in their vnbeleefe, yea though one ſhould riſe from rhe dead and preach vnto them. To ſpeake any more of this matter to you, were no otherwiſe then if I ſhould light a candle to ſhew you who are ſound and cleare ſighted, the ſunne ſhining heere before vs. You ſee that the creatures and light of nature to the heathen, the ſcripture and word of God to the Church, the ſanctifying and illuminating ſpirit of God to the faithfull, the gifts of prophecie, reuelation, and other miraculous actions (the which are not now needfull in the Church, as they were before the comming of Chriſt, and in the firſt publiſhing of the Goſpell) to all that either haue thē themſelues, or behold them in others, are infallible demonſtrations of the Godhead, & ſuch againſt the which no exceptiō can be made: yet not withanding al this, it is a wonder (but that it is ſo cōmon) to cōſider how Atheiſme doth daily preuaile among men, yea far more then it did amongſt eyther the ſuperſtitious papiſts, or the idolatrous heathen, of whom

there were very fewe, which had not their religion and Gods in great reuerence, and moſt high eſtimation, whereas now a dayes, fewe do make any account of religion or of the worſhip of God, but as of a formall and ordinarie matter of courſe, which for order and faſhions ſake, is to be performed. And accordingly, it pleaſeth God to deale with them in his iuſt iudgement, for the hardening of their hearts, that for ſo much as they haue ſo wilfully reiected ſo many meanes of knowledge, he doth wholely abſtain from any further reuealing of himſelfe by any extraordinary meanes, but ſuffereth euery one to go on and to proſper in their owne deuiſes and wicked wayes, that ſo their impunitie may confirme them in their ignorance and contempt of God: the which is more to be wondred at, and to be lamented, many of them that haue had ſome knowledge and ſence of religion reuealed vnto them, and haue made conſcience of it in their liues, yet ſeeing no great matters or effects to come of it, but the ordinary courſe & faſhion of the world, they faint in faith by little and little, till at length they become if not open, yet ſecret contemners of God & all religion. And ſo is fulfilled the prophecie of Chriſt, Math. 24. 12. 24. That in the laſt ages of the world, iniquitie

ſhall ſo abound, that it ſhall coole the lukewarme loue of many, in ſo much, that if it were poſſible, the very elect ſhould fall away from the faith, and be deceiued: but I doubt not but that you are farre from that fearefull eſtate. Gen. That which you haue ſaid, as touching the exiſtence of God, dothfully ſatiſfie me and may content any reaſonable man: yet becauſe I do ſometimes meete with men that are euen rooted and confirmed in Atheiſme, and will not ſticke to denie that there is a God, I pray you furniſh mee with ſome fewe arguments, wherwith to conuince and to confound them.
                  
                  
                     Sch.
                     Indeed there are many, which are to be accounted Atheiſts, for that they denie the doctrine of Gods prouidence, and the truth of his word and promiſes, made to his Church of eternall glory (the proofe and declaration whereof muſt bee referred to theyr proper places) wherein we did both agree: but ſure I thinke, you meete with fewe or none, that are either ſo brutiſh in mind, or ſo ſhameles in face, as to denie that there is a God, neither to my remembrance haue I euer either heard or read of any ſuch. The Epicurean Philoſophers among the heathen, were counted Atheiſts, as they might wel be, for they exempted God from the care of humane

things, and from the the gouernment of the world, but they neither denied nor doubted but that there was a God. And ſo I thinke of our epicures and Atheiſts in theſe dayes, that howſoeuer they might as well denie God to exiſt, as to contemne and reiect his word, threatnings, and promiſes, as meere fables, and to be altogither voyd of any care or regard of him, yet if they were examined, I thinke they would confeſſe, that they think there is a God, tho they haue neither knowledge nor care of him.
                  
                  
                     Gen.
                     You may in fauor & gentlenes make the beſt of their Atheiſme, tho to ſay the truth, the beſt be bad inogh) but I can aſſure you of my owne experience, that there are ſuch, that denie not onely the prouidence, but euen the very nature and exiſtence of God.

                         ſhewe them any, but rather extream, & yet not ſufficient hatred: for howſoeuer I vſe to be (I know not how) too eaſie and indifferent in iudging and condemning thoſe that hold euen groſſe hereſies, as thinking, that either there may be ſome truth and grace with great errors, or at the leaſt that they may be reclaimed from them: yet when I think of ſuch monſters as you ſpeake of, I feele my heart to riſe againſt them ſo, that I

could more willingly teare them in peeces with my teeth, then teach thē with my toong. Yea to tell you plainly, I think that ſuch hauing liued in the Church, and in the light of the Goſpell and word of God, are not to bee diſputed with, or perſwaded by reaſons, but rather as men giuen vp to a reprobate ſence, and branded with the moſt fearefull marke of the wrath and vengeance of God, to bee leſt to his iuſt iudgement. For if an Hereticke be to be auoided and left after a fewe admonitions, as being wilfull and obſtinate, what then ſhould be done to theſe, that haue reiected a thouſand admonitions giuen them, not onely by the teſtimonie of the whole world in all ages, but alſo by the creatures, word, and extraordinary workes of God. And therefore I pray you, let vs not trouble our ſelues any further with thē, but rather go on to ſom matter, the conſideration whereof, may be profitable vnto vs: for as you know, Contra principia negantē, non eſt diſputandū.
                     
                  
                  
                     Gent.
                     I confeſſe that they are in a moſt fearful caſe, & deſerue to be abhorred both of god & mā, yet whē as I am by ſome neceſſarie occaſion in company with thē, and heare thē proteſt thēſelues to be, not wilfull in gainſaying, but willing to learn the truth, I wiſh they might be reclaimed, or at ye
                         leaſt, that their mouths were ſo ſtopped, that they did no harm to others: & therfore I pray you ſhew me, how I ſhuld deale with them?
                  
                  
                     
                     Sch.
                     It is impoſſible to ſhewe or prooue the exiſtence of God, by any other argumēts then haue bin brought, for that God hath reuealed himſelfe by thoſe onely, and by no other meanes: to wit, by his word and ſpirit to his Church, and by his workes to the world. Now the firſt kind of theſe arguments is to be vſed againſt the temptations and doubtes ariſing in the mindes of beleeuing Chriſtians, but not againſt the horrible blaſphemies of theſe ſhameleſſe Atheiſts, and therefore you muſt inſiſt in the workes of God, the which being ſenſible, cannot be denied by them. By theſe you may ſhew the exiſtence of God, both by the ordinary workes of the creation and preſeruation of the world (the which in truth, are moſt miraculous) as alſo by the miraculous and extraordinary workes and iudgemēts of God. For the firſt, you muſt aske him if he ſee not in the creatures, to wit, in their greatneſſe and number, proportion and bewtie, force and efficacie, cerraine ſignes and arguments, of ſome great wit, cunning, wiſedome, goodneſſe and power: would he confeſſe this thinke you?
                  
                  
                     Gent.
                     Surely if hee denied it, I would leaue him as being not a man endued with reaſon, but a brute beaſt, or rather a ſenceleſſe ſtocke.
                  
                  
                     
                     Sch.
                     Well then, if theſe things appeare in the creatures, they muſt be confeſſed to be in ſome ſubiect or perſon, and that either in the creatures themſelues, or in ſome other, but that is all one, for whatſoeuer thing is endued with ſo great wiſdome and power as is neceſſarely required to the making and preſeruing of the world, that without queſtion, is to be
                           •
                         magnified and worſhipped as God, and to be accounted God. This demonſtration of the Godhead is plaine, as plaine need be, to any that will conſider it, and yet the extraordinary works of God do more affect men, althogh in themſelues they be nothing ſo miraculous: euen as we ſee, that men do more gaze on and admire a ſtately houſe, which they neuer ſaw before, and think that there is more cunning workemanſhip and brauery in it, then in the frame of the whole world, which is continually in their eyes. And therfore, you muſt lay before the eyes of your Atheiſts, the ſtrange & miraculous things, which haue bin done in all ages of the world (more or leſſe) contrary to the courſe of nature: and if hee reiect all ſtories, both diuine and prophane, yet God doth neuer leaue himſelfe without ſome of of theſe extraordinary witneſſes. Not that he doth now ſend his Angels viſibly to good mē with bleſſings, for they beleeuing his word,

need no extraordinarie proofes, but for that he ſuffereth Satan to ſhew himſelf to the wicked and vnbeleeuers, not only in ſtrange illuſions, but alſo by ſearful plagues & puniſhments, the which I warrant you hee will confeſſe to come, not by the ordinarie courſe of his goddeſſe nature, but from ſome ſupernaturall power, whereof we haue of late had euident examples, to the aſtoniſhment of all men. And if your Atheiſt wil not beleeue his owne eyes, beholding the ſtrange iudgemēts of God in others, but will rather giue his owne ſences the lye, then acknowledge the truth of the Godhead, let him but by ſome iniurious deed, or cōtumelious word, prouoke ſome witch of Endor, that hath the temporary power ouer ſome ſpirit, vpon condition, that he ſhall haue eternall power ouer her, and it is like inough he being voyd of all faith and ſence of God, & ſo out of his protection) that he ſhall feele to his coſt, and confeſſe to his ſhame, that there is a power ouer and beſide the ordinary courſe of nature.
                  
                  
                     Gent.
                     Indeed theſe Atheiſts that denie God, do alſo denie that there is eyther diuel or Angel, & I think will confeſſe them all aſſoone as any one.

                     Gent.
                     
                        YOu haue ſo fully reſolued me, and ſetled my minde in this poynt, that 
                           •
                         truſt neuer hereafter to bee troubled with the obiections which Athiſts make againſt the diuine eſſence: eſpecially, if that I might by any meanes, haue the nature of God declared and deſcribed as it is indeed. For this is the cauſe, why men are ſo eaſily brought to doubt of the being and exiſtence of God, becauſe they cannot conceiue or comprehend the manner or forme of his eſſence, nor haue any true notion of it ſetled and fixed in their mindes: whereby it commeth to paſſe, that the imagination of mā, caſting god in a thousād moules, & turning him into as many diuerſe formes, as Proteus is fained to haue, neuer reſting contēted with any, as neuer finding any garment that will ſit cloſe on his backe, or any forme agreeing

to the infinitneſſe & ſubtilitie of his eſſence, reiecteth all, and with all, euen the diuine nature it ſelfe: ſuppoſing it not at all to exiſt, which they cannot ſuppoſe how it doth exiſt. And therefore, if I may entreate you to take the like paines in ſhewing the manner and forme of Gods eſſence, which you haue done in proouing the truth and certaintie of his exiſtence, you ſhall make me much beholden and indebted to you.
                  
                  
                     Sch.
                     Indeed it is impoſsible, as for you to keepe that, which you neuer had, ſo for me, either to declare that to you in words, which I my ſelfe did neuer conceiue in minde, or to comprehend that within the compaſſe of my narrow and ſhallow braine, which is in nature infinit and incomprehenſible: for ſo we are to thinke of God, that his nature and eſſence being euery way infinit, cannot poſsibly be comprehended by any finite creature: no not by the heauenly Angels themſelues, whoſe nature being ſubtile and ſpiritual, doth eaſily pierce into the depth of knowledge: how much leſſe then by men, who in compariſon of Angels, are but dolts and dul-pates, groueling here on earth in the mudde and myre of error and groſſe ignorance: vnable by any art or induſtrie, to finde out the true nature, forme and vertue

of the meaneſt creatures, no not of the leaſt Flie or Gnat, how much leſſe then of the mightie Iehoua, whoſe ſeate is in the heauen, and whoſe footeſtoole is the earth. But what need I alledge the impoſſibilitie of comprehending fully in our finit mindes and memories, the infinit eſſence of God, it beeing impoſsible for vs, to commence or begin this action, by receiuing into our imaginations or fancies, any true conceit of him. Things ſubiect to ſenſe, are conceited in the minde, by a reſemblance or ſimilitude of them, which the ſenſe doth draw from the things themſelues. But as for things not ſubiect to ſenſe (of the which nature, all men confeſſe God to be) how ſhall they conuey and ſend to the imagination, their picture and reſemblance? ſurely they cannot doo it themſelues, but muſt ſubſtitute in their roomes, that ſenſible thing, which is likeſt vnto them, to repreſent their perſon, as if a man that is far abſent, ſhould will the Painter to draw his picture and counterfait, by beholding the viſage of his ſonne or brother, being not much vnlike vnto him. But what creature ſhall 
                           •
                        it in Gods chayre of eſtate, and repreſent his perſon to our imaginations and mindes?
                     Whereunto ſhall wee compare or liken

Whereunto ſhall we compare or liken God? or how can we not thinke it to be vnlawfull, and flatly forbidden by the law of God, to reſemble him to any thing, eyther in, or within heauen? or to frame any Image or ſimilitude of him, eyther by outward action in deed, or by inward imaginatiōn in our mindes? Thus God perſwadeth the people of Iſrael from making any Image, wherein to worſhip him, becauſe they had not ſeene him in any forme, and therefore could not tell after what faſhion the Image ſhould bee made: Deut. 4. 15.
                     Beſides, it may be doubted, whether it be lawfull or not, to attempt the ſearching and finding out of the nature and eſſence of God, which wee haue not in the ſcriptures reuealed vnto vs. We know that God in reuealing himſelfe to men, hath reſerued ſome things ſecret to himſelfe, the which it is his glory to conceale, Prou. 25. 2. and therefore his diſhonour to haue them knowne. Deuter. 29. 29. Let the hidden things be with the Lord our GOD, and the reuealed things to vs, and to our children for euer. But what can bee hidden or ſecret in GOD, if his very forme and eſſence bee reuealed?
                     And therefore we ought to bee rather

ſober and modeſt, then hotte and haſtie in purſuing the knowledge of the diuine eſſence.
                     It is ſufficient for vs, that we may enter into the Temple and Church of God, and there behold his mercie and goodneſſe, yea his power and iuſtice toward the wicked: what need we be ſo preſumptuous, as with the mēe of Bethſemes, to look into the a

                        ke of the Lord, 1. Sam. 6. 19. or to enter into the holy of holieſt? or how dare we ſet eyther foot or face into that place, which the Lord hath incloſed with glory, and made ſeuerall for his owne abode, and there to behold, or rather to outface the Maieſtie of God, ſitting in his Cherubin chaire of eſtate, the which the Angels themſelues neither can not yet dare behold, and therefore with their wings couer their faces, leaſt that they ſeeing it, ſhould be confounded, as ouerwhelmed with the greatneſſe of his glory? And therfore for this m
                           •
                        tter, I muſt deſire you to hold me excuſed, if I do not take vpon me to declare vnto you the eſſence of God, the knowledge whereof I am ſure it is impoſsible to attaine, and I doubt whether it be lawfull to attempt.
                  
                  
                     Gent.
                     You put me into a ſtraunge maze and quandary, in that you would ma

                        e me beleeue, that I

had committed ſom hainous offence in deſiring to comprehend the infinit, and know the ſecret eſſence of God. But by your patience a litle: is it now become a fault to ſeeke the knowledge of God, in the knowledge and contemplation of whom not only the ſcripture and (as I haue heard) all diuines with one aſſent, but euen Plato an heathē Philoſopher, although ſomewhat ſmelling of the truth of religion, do make our whole happineſſe to cō
                        ſiſt? the infinitneſſe of the nature of God doth hinder the full comprehenſion, but not the true knowledge of it ſelfe to be in the minde of man: the ſight of the eye, no not the whole eye, is able to containe the body of the Sun, and yet by it, we do plainly beholde, and truly know the Sun, Moone, & Starres, yea the whole heauen. What thogh it be not lawfull, evher to make any Image, or to imagine any ſimilitude of God? yet we may conſider of the nature of God, by cōparing it to the nature of the creature, though there bee neuer ſo great inequalitie betwixt them. Yea the infiniteneſſe of Gods nature, is moſt plainly ſeene, when it is compared to a finite and meane creature, as wee knowe that the chearefull lightſomneſſe, and faireneſſe of white, is beſt perceiued,

when a darke and ſad backe is laid by it: that the hugeneſſe of an Eliphant is moſt admired, when wee thinke of he ſmalneſſe of a flie: and a crooked building is beſt knowne by the ſtraight line. The whole bodie and compaſſe of the ſun and moone may bee behelde in a little diſhfull of wate
                           •
                        , and why not God in his creatures, eſpecially in thoſe which hee hath made according to his owne image, and that as I am perſwaded, for this very end and purpoſe? But although the nature of god might be by ſome means in ſome meaſure conceiued and knowne, yet you doubt of the lawfulneſſe of the attempt: but your doubting is without cauſe, or rather as I am perſwaded, without trueth, and in ſhewe onely. The propitiatorie is now remooued, and the Arke vncouered, ſo that we may be bolde to looke into it: the vaile of the Temple is rent a ſunder, yea quite broken downe, and therefore wee need not any longer ſtand aloofe, but may with confidence enter into the holy place, & approach vnto the throne of grace. It is not with God as it is with mortall and ſinfull men, who of ſet purpoſe, and in good pollicie doo (in many caſes) withdraw themſelues from the ſight and view of others, leaſt that by bewraying their infirmities, they ſhuld bring their perſons into contempt:

but God is not aſhamed of himſelfe, neither afraid of being knowne, ſeene and cenſured. Men, the further they are off from vs, the greater they ſeeme, and the leſſe they are known, th
                           •
                         more they are eſteemed: the more familia
                           •
                        ly that they are acquainted, the more likely to bee contemned: but it is not ſo with God, who the more he is known, the more he is admired, the nearer he approcheth to vs, the more he amazeth & aſtonieth with his 
                           •
                        urpaſsing glorie and maieſtie: ſo that he may not vnfitly be compared to the cloude, which the Prophet Elias, or rather God himſelfe raiſed out of the ſea, 1. King. 18. 14. which a farre off ſeemed no bigger then the palme of a mans hand, but when it came neare, it couered the whole face of heauen. I confeſſe indeed, that the eſſence of God cannot be fully comprehended by any creature, and that if God ſhould ſhine vppon vs with the bright beames of his glorie, wee could not but bee confounded, as we ſee our eyes to be dazeled, and our ſight dimmed by gazing on the bright ſhining ſunne. For this, the word of God is plaine, Exod. 33. 20. where God ſaith to Moſes, My face, that is, my full glorie and maieſtie, no man can ſee and liue, but as for my hinder partes, that is, ſome part or ſhadow of my glorie, that I will

ſhew vnto thee. Yet the doth not proue, that this great and greedie, yea inſatiable deſire, which this holy man of God had, of ſeeing and knowing ſtill more and more of God, yea after that God had many waies reuealed himſelfe more fully to Moſes, then euer hee had done, or did ſince to any man liuing, ſhould bee condemned as raſh and pre
                           •
                        umptuous, which rather is to be commended and imitated of vs, by hauing a moſt earneſt care and deſire to know ſo much of Gods eſſence as may bee knowne, yea much more, and euen the whole nature of God, if ſo it ſtood with his good pleaſure. For this is the onely happineſſe which we aſpire vnto, & hope for in the life to tome, that whereas now we ſee God but darkly in part, and as it were his image in a glaſſe, thē, we ſhall ſee him face to face, 1. Cor. 13. that is, in farre more ample manner then now wee doo, although not ſo fully and amply as hee is indeede, vnto the which abſolute perfection of the knowledge of Gods eſſence, I doo eaſily graunt you, that neither the Saints nor the Angels in heauen can poſsibly attaine. And therefore, ſeeing that my requeſt is no other, then both I may wel and lawfully make, and you eaſily performe, I pray you doo not ſhift mee off with this excuſe, which I am perſwaded you made, thinking as it is indeed,

that you Schollers

The moon is made of green cheeſe: but rather at my requeſt take in hand the explication of this poynt, which of all other is moſt needfull to be knowne, and moſt woorthie to bee ſought out with all care and diligence, as beeing that wherevnto all our knowledge, yea our whole life is to be referred.
                  
                  
                     Sch.
                     I am glad ſir, that I haue by this means ferreted you out of this deepe diſsimulation, wheerin you haue hitherto ſo cloſely lurked: although indeed I did thinke ſo much, whē I firſt heard you ſpeake, & did ſuſpect you to be the man, whō now I finde you to be. I am perſwaded, that you who are ſo cunning in crauing, could if you liſt bee as bountifull in giuing: but ſeeing the bargaine is made, it is now no going backe: neither will I looke backe vnto the ſpeech which you haue made of the lawfulneſſe of attempting, and the poſſibilitie of attaining the knowledge of Gods nature in ſome ſort: It was true, and therefore cannot be confuted, yet was full and ſufficient, and therefore need not bee enlarged. You doo well to confeſſe that the infinit eſſence of god cannot be fully comprehended,

no not by the Angels in heauen, & yet that it may in ſome ſort be knowne euen by men here on earth. For euen as when a traueller deſirous to ſee ſtraunge countries and faſhions, arriueth in ſome coaſt towne of any forraine kingdome, hee may euen there gather ſome coniectures, and get ſome knowledge of the condition, ſtate and power of that Prince: but when he commeth to the chiefe and mother-citie of the land, where the kings Court is kept, and where there is greateſt concourſe of people, abundance of wealth, and ſtore of all things, ſeruing either for the neceſsitie and vſe of warre, or the pl
                           ••
                        ſure of peace, then he ſaith thus vnto himſelfe: Surely now I ſee and knowe the very ſtate and power of this Prince, as well as I doo that man, whoſe face I doo fully and ſtedfaſtly behold: and yet all this while, he neither is, nor can bee admitted to ſee the very perſon of the Prince. Euen ſo it fareth with vs in reſpect of nod: for here on earth, as it were in Dan or Berſheba, or ſome other border-town of the land of Promiſe, the happie kingdome of Chanaan, wee haue a glimmering of the king. But when wee come to the heauenly Ieruſalem, the Cittie of the great king, there we ſee a thouſand times mote then we did before, and yet all that we ſee, is but the riches,

power, and glorie of the king: as for his perſon and verie eſſence, that is kept ſecret, and ſhut vp in his priuie chamber, or cloſet, into the which none may or can enter, for none but god knoweth God, 1. Tim. 6. 16. the king of kings, who onely hath immortalitie and dwelleth in light, that none can haue acceſſe vnto, whom neuer man ſaw, neither can ſee: yet although the nature of god be vnſearchable, & as a bottomleſſe gulfe, into the middeſt whereof whoſoeuer plungeth himſelfe, in hope of ſounding the depth of it, wil without queſtion be ſoon ſwallowed vp by it, and confounded in al his imaginations yea thogh hee were indued with the wit of all the men and Angels in the world: yet I confeſſe, that as you ſay, we may ſafely wade and ſwimme in the ſhallowe brinke of this great Ocean: hauing the one hand on the ſhore or banke, as a ſure anchor to hold vs faſt, that wee bee not carried too farre into it, by the violent blaſtes of preſumption and curioſitie: and the other in the water, wherewith to mooue our minds vp and down, in a ſober and modeſt contemplation of it.
                  
               
               
                  
                  
                     Sect. 2.
                  LEt vs therefore let looſe into this deepe and bottomleſſe ſea of the nature of God, not in any fond hope of attaining the perfect knowledge of it, yet truſting in God, that we ſhall not looſe our labour, and fiſh all night without catching any thing, (as on the other ſide, it were madneſſe to thinke of catching al the fiſh in the ſea) but rather returne to land with our veſſels not emptie, although not ſo full lade, that they be readie to ſinke, by reaſon of the heauineſſe of their burthen. The knowledge (therefore) of the the natures of things, is attained two waies, to wit, by ſenſe, and by imagination: ſenſe apprehendeth the qualities of things ſenſible, by the which the minde is led to thenature and ſubſtance of the thing. But as for thoſe things which are not ſenſible, wee muſt ſuppoſe & imagine thē to be thus & thus, and ſo coine in our minds, a forme and phantaſtical idea of them, reſembling them to ſomething, which wee haue ſometime apprehended by ſence, and eſpecially to that which is likeſt, and commeth neareſt vnto them.
                  
                     
                     Soh.
                     That to the ſearching out, and the knowing of the nature of any inſencible thing, theſe three things belong & muſt concurre. Firſt, the obſeruation of the effects or actions proceeding from it, the which being ſenſible, will giue vs ſome light to know the nature of the thing it ſelfe, from the which they did proceed, as we ſee the nature of the father to appeare in the ſonne, of the roote in the fruite, and of the fountaine in the ſtreams iſſuing from it. Secondly, when as by this and whatſoeuer other meanes we haue, wee haue gotten ſome knowledge of the nature of it, and to what kinde of things it i
                           •
                         to bee referred, we muſt then as it were, comming nearer to the purpoſe, and bringing foorth into act the conceit of the minde, reſemble it to that thing, the which of all other things in the world commeth neareſt, and is likeſt vnto it. Yet wee haue not attained to that which we deſire, for we haue not the thing it ſelfe, but onely a patterne or example, a likeneſſe or reſemblance of it: and therefore in the third and laſt place, we muſt adde to this example or patterne, that which is wanting: ſquaring it in all reſpects to the idea and conceit which we firſt had of the nature of the thing. For example, a man hearing much ſpeech of ye
                         Angels, wold gladly know, what,

and of what nature and eſſence they are: to the effecting whereof, he is deſirous to ſee, heare or feele one of them, hoping by thi
                           •
                         meanes to know what they are, as he vſeth to bee by his ſences taught the nature of other things. But in the triall he findeth, there can no good bee done by this meanes, the Angel
                           •
                         being ſpirituall and inſenſible creatures, 
                           •
                        nd that therefore hee muſt go ſome other way to worke, and ſearch out their nature, by the eyes not of his bodie, but of his mind, and geſſe at their natures, by that which he hath heard and read of their effects, functions and actions. As touching the which, hee findeth in ſcripture that they are Gods ſeruants, continually attending his pleaſure, and praiſing him, and readily performing whatſoeuer hee commaundeth. Wherevpon hee inferreth, ſurely the Angels liue, for they mooue: and they are not brute beaſtes, but reaſonable creatures: yea, not ſimple ideots, but of great vnderſtanding and wiſedome, without the which they could neuer diſpatch thoſe affairs aright, about the which God imployeth them: and further, that they are not weaklings, but of great ſtrength, for otherwiſe one of them could not haue deſtroyed in one night, an hundreth foureſcore and fiue thouſand of the Aſſyrians, as we read 2. Ki. 19. 35.

and laſtly, that they are not baſe or contemtible, but moſt glorious creatures, fit to ſtand and ſerue in the preſence of God. Thus he conceiuing and imagining them, to bee moſt mightie, wiſe, and glorious creatures, to what thing in the world can hee reſemble them more fitly, then to the moſt excellent men in the world, endued with the greateſt meaſure of power, glory, authoritie, knowledge and wiſdome?
                     Now we are come as neare them as wee can in any one thing, for there is nothing more like to an Angell, then is an excellent man, whereof it commeth, that the name of an Angel, is often giuen to men: yet we haue not attained our purpoſe, for there is yet great difference and oddes betwixt them, therefore to make them euen, wee muſt take from this excellent man, this groſſe body of clay and earth, and giue vnto him a pure and ſpirituall body, voyd of all mixture of elements and moyſture, the which debaſeth and keepeth him downe beneathe the Angels, who being not clogged and preſſed downe with ſuch heauie lumppes of clay, nor hauing their cleare vnderſtandings dimmed with ſoggie myſtes of moyſture, excell him farre in nimbleneſſe, quickneſſe of wit,

and in all other reſpects. But what need we ſuppoſe this Angelicall man, whom we haue truly exiſting? for we know that in heauen the bodies of the Saints ſhall bee pure and ſpirituall, free from all heauie lumpiſhneſſe: yet the faithfull being glorified, ſhall not become Angels, but ſtill be men, for neither in ſubtilitie of body, nor yet in excellencie of inward gifts, ſhall they bee made equall to the Angels.
                     Thus we haue with much ado, make the humane and the Angelical nature meet togither, and vſed the one as a Glaſſe, to repreſent and make knowne the other vnto vs.
                     Now then to apply all this to our purpoſe, for the finding out of Gods nature, wee muſt doo theſe three things: firſt, we muſt get an idea, or conceit of it into our mindes, by ſearching what manner of thing God is, and ſo to what kinde his nature doth belong, and is to bee referred: in the ſecond place, we muſt get a patterne, example, or reſemblance of it in ſome thing really exiſting: and laſtly, we muſt by adding and detracting, make them euen or equall. For the firſt, ſeeing that the nature of God cannot bee knowne, eyther by any eſſentiall cauſes or

by ſenſible qualities, we muſt imagin it by the effects, actions and workes, whether they be ordinarie, or extraordinarie: Rom. 1. 20. The inuiſible things of God, that is, his eternall power and Godhead, are ſeene by the creation of the world, beeing conſidered in his works. For ſo it hath pleaſed God (to the end he might make himſelfe knowne to man, and man happie by knowing him) after a ſort to take vnto this his inuiſible and inſenſible nature, this viſible and ſenſible ſhape, and to couer himſelfe with the creatures, as with a garment, that ſo he might diſcouer and reueale his hidden nature to man, as we know, that both he himſelfe, as alſo his Angels, haue ſhewed themſelues to men, by putting on the nature and ſhape of man. Not that we imagine, as ſome haue done, that God is the ſoule or life of the world, and the world the body of God: for God is not in the creatures, eyther as their matter, or as their forme, but onely is to them the efficient: but becauſe the creatures make Gods inuiſible nature to be knowne, therfore we call them, the ſhape or forme of God. For by this meanes it is broght to paſſe, that althogh God Iehoua, as he exiſteth in himſelfe, and as he did exiſt before the creation, be inuiſible, yet God the Creator of heauen and earth, is as viſible, as

are the Starres by night, or the Sunne at midday in the heauen, and as palpable, as is the groſſe earth whereon we tread: as it is, Act. 17. 27. God hath made the world, that in it men might ſeeke him, yea grope after him and feele him. Thus both the creatures, and alſo the extraordinary workes of God, done both within and alſo without the Church, and recorded both in holy Scripture, as alſo in other true Records and. Hiſtories, teach vs what God is: yea thus they preach to the whole world, as touching God their maker & Author, that he is a liuing and working, yea a mightie and wiſe nature, excellent, yea infinit in all goodneſſe: to wit, in knowledge and wiſdome, in truth and iuſtice, in loue and mercie, in power and ſtrength, in glorie and maieſtie. Thus hauing conceiued in our mindes an idea or imagination of Gods nature, we are in the next place, to bring it forth into the world, by getting an example or reſemblance of it, in ſome thing not vnlike vnto it. But againſt this patterne or reſemblance it will bee obiected (the which you touched before) that both it is impoſsible to finde any thing in the world, that is like to God, or fit to be a reſemblance, and alſo, that if there could any ſuch thing be found, yet it were Idolatrie, to reſemble God to any creature.

Whereunto we anſwere, firſt to the former part of the obiection, that although the vnlikeneſſe to God, be farre greater in the creatures, then the likeneſſe, yet that there is no creature, which is not more or leſſe in one reſpect or other, like vnto him: for whatſoeuer is good, commendable, or excellent in any creature (as all the creatures are good, yea euery one of them endued with a proper and peculiar goodneſſe) that commeth from God, who is the fountaine of all goodneſſe, and maketh the creature to bee like to God. So then if the meaneſt and baſeſt creatures haue ſome likeneſſe to God, without doubt the excellent creatures cannot but haue a great likeneſſe and reſemblance vnto him: the which wee knowe, that GOD himſelfe in the Scripture doth graunt vnto them, calling man his owne ſimilitude, God made man in the likeneſſe of GOD. Geneſ. 5. 1. Yea, although there were no manner of likeneſſe or reſemblance betwixt GOD and the creatures, but rather all contrarietie and flat repugnancie, yet they might profitably bee vſed for the illuſtration of his nature, as wee knowe that all contraries doo argue and illuſtrate each other. The which way of teaching, although it bee not the readieſt to attaine

the truth: for that doctrine and knowledge are poſitiue not priuatiue, conſiſting not in the negation of that which is not, or is not true, but in the affirmation of that, which doth truly and really exiſt, yet it is alwaies an helpe, and ſometimes the onely meanes.
                     To the other parte of the obiection, wee aunſwere, confeſsing that it were flat Idolatry, and vtterly vnlawfull, to make or ſuppoſe God to be ſimply like or equall to any creature, for that were to pul him downe from his Throne of maieſtie, and to place him among the creatures: yet affirming it to be very lawfull, to reſemble him to any creature, the difference which is betwixt them, being obſerued and mentioned. Thus Act. 17. 29. the Apoſtle Paul reſembleth the diuine nature to the humane, proouing againſt the Idolatrons Athenians, that God is not like to thoſe ſtocks and ſtones, wherin the heathen did worſhip him, becauſe hee is like vnto man, who is of a cōtrary nature to ſenceleſſe things. We men (ſaith he) being the kind of God, it cannot be, that God being like vnto vs, that he ſhuld be like to ſiluer, gold, or to any ſenceleſſe thing: where tho he make theſe two natures of God & man like to each other, yet he maketh them not equall, but putteth

the difference, in that hee maketh man to come and flowe from God, as a little arme or creeke of the ſea, from the great Ocean. Yea thus God hath throughout the whole Scripture reuealed himſelfe vnto vs in the forme and ſhape of a man, aſcribing to himſelfe the parts of his body, as his eyes and eares, his hands and feete, yea all the faculties, affections and paſsions of his minde and will, and that both ſeuerally, ſometimes one and ſometimes an other, and alſo al togither, aſſuming to himſelfe, the whole ſhape and forme of a man, as namely, Ezech. 1. 26. vpon the ſimilitude of the Throne, there was as it were a ſimilitude of a man vpon it: whereof is ſaid, Verſ. 26. This was the appearance of the ſimilitude of the glory of the Lord: and when I ſaw it, I fell vpon my face: ſo Dan. 7. 9. I beheld till the thrones were ſet, and the ancient of dayes did ſit, whoſe garment was white as ſnowe, and the hayre of his head like the pure woll. Likewiſe, Eſ. 6. 1. the Prophet ſaith: I ſawe the Lord ſitting vppon a high throne. By the which ſitting vpon a Throne, althogh ſignifying royall glorie and maieſtie, God doth not exalt or aduance, but rather debaſe himſelfe, and that for our ſakes, that we by this meanes might get ſome conceit and knowledge of him into our

mindes: yet if we ſhould continue and reſt in theſe formes, without adding the difference vnto them, wee ſhould not helpe, but hurt and hinder our ſelues, and get not the knowledge, but the ignorance of God.
                  
               
               
                  
                     Sect. 3.
                  NOw let vs go on, and ſee what creature in all the world is to be accounted likeſt vnto God, and fitteſt to reſemble his nature vnto vs, as wee gathered it to bee by the conſideration of his workes. The queſtion is not hard to be anſwered: for this being taken for granted, that God hauing made al things, is far more excellent then any or all of them, it will follow, that that creature, which of all other, is moſt excellent, is the likeſt, and commeth neareſt to the nature of God, and doth more fitly reſemble him, then any of the other: as we know that among men, not any of the raſkall ſort, but ſome great Noble man or Prince of the blood, is moſt fit, in the abſence or nonage of the king, to hold his place, and repreſent his perſon. For although euery creature bee good in his owne kind, as (wee reade in Geneſ. 1. 31.) yet looke how many diuers kindes of creatures there are, ſo many diuers degrees of goodneſſe there are, the

higheſt whereof are to bee accounted excellent, as we ſee all the ſtarres to be bright and glorious, yet the ſunne, moone, and ſome other, to be the moſt excellent in light & glorie; as they were in the beginning, called by God himſelfe by the name of great lights. Thus no man will denie but a common peeble ſtone, is better then a raw lumpe of clay, or a handfull of earth: that a tree is more glorious then a ſtone, that a liuing beaſt excelleth a tree, that a reaſonable man is better thē a brute beaſt, an Angell then a man, and an Archangell then one of lower degree: and ſo will any man conſeſſe that God, whoſe infinit knowledge and wiſedome, appeareth in the creation of the world, is not to be placed among the ſenceleſſe and brutiſh creatures, but to be referred to the kinde of reaſonable things. And ſo indeed throughout the whole ſcripture, we ſee that God is content to take a place among his reaſonable creatures, to be accounted to be of their nature and kind, as hath beene ſhewed out of Act. 17. 26. to call them, to wit, both men and Angels, his image and ſimililtude, and in that reſpect, his ofſpring, ſonnes and children, yea to appeare and ſhewe himſelf, in the forme and ſhape, ſomtimes of the one, & ſomtimes of ye
                      other. But to come as neare the marke, we ayme at,

as we can, although both the humane & the angelicall nature, be notable images, ſimilitudes, and reſemblances of God, yet as the Angels are farre more excellent then men, ſo they are (in themſelues) farre more fit tipes and examples of the diuine nature, then men are, for that they haue many properties of the diuine nature which man wanteth. For man is mortall and corruptible, but both the Angels and God are immortall and incorruptible: hee conſiſteth of a medley of contrarie qualities, continually iarting and fighting togither, vntil at length one deſtroy another: but their nature and ſubſtance is vniforme, not waſting it ſelfe, or wearing away, but ſtedfaſt permanent, and the ſame for euer: he is viſible, yea groſſe and palpable, but they are inuiſible, inſenſible, ſubtile, pure and ſpirituall: hee hath litle ſtrength with much weakneſſe, they haue great power and might without impotencie or infirmitie: hee hath knowledge with ignorance: truth with error: wiſedome, with folly: will with peruerſeneſſe and obſtinacie: affection with paſsion and perturbation, loue with luſt: abundance with many wants, contentment with complaint: day with night: ioy with ſorrow: glorie with ſhame: and happineſſe with miſerie: but they are perfectly wiſe, vertuous, mightie, glorious and happie.
                  
                     
Yea, by this excellencie aboue man, the Angelical nature is prooued (againſt thoſe who will not beleeue the word of God, vnleſſe their owne ſences ſay amen) to exiſt as a meane betwixt man and god, although farre nearer the lower, then the vpper extreame. For if there were no nature exiſting betwixt God and man, the diſtance and downfall would be greater then is meete, in reſpect of that dependance & cohaerence, which ſhould be betwixt the creature & the creator, cloſely combined togither without any ſuch wide and abrupt gappe, in order and due proportion. The which wide gap betwixt God and man, the angelical nature doth fill vp, participating ſomewhat of each nature, as it were hanging and houering in the middle region betwixt heauen and earth, hauing had a beginning with man, and n
                        •
                     w being immortall with God: voyde of all mixture as is God, and yet conſiſting of matter & forme, as doth man: ſubſiſting in ſome matter, ſubiect and ſubſtance as doth man, yet being incorporeal as is God: able in a moment to bee any where, as God alwaies is euery where, yet locall, and circumſcribed by place as is a man: being of wonderful capacitie & knowledge, as is God, yet ignorant of ſome things, (as namely of the eſſence of God) as is mā: & in

one word, being euerie way finit as is man, yet perfect in al reſpects as is God. Thus we haue by the degrees of the creatures, as it were by the ſtaires and ſteppes of Iacobs ladder, climbed vp to heauen, and leauing men with the reſt of the earthly creatures, groueling heere in the duſt belowe, by the wings of Angels ſoared aloft to the diuine nature, or rather (to ſpeake more properly) toward it. Neither is it poſsible for vs to goe any higher, or to finde more of God in any thing, then wee haue alreadie found in the angelical nature. Wherevpon our Sauiour Chriſt doubteth not to put on Gods backe, this glorious robe of the angelical naure, hauing amongſt all the formes and ſhapes in the world, none more excellent wherewith to inueſt him, and therefore he ſaith, Ioh 4. 24. God is a ſpirit, as he is elſewhere in ſcripture called an Angell, and an Archangell. But this ſaying is warely to be taken, and wiſely vnderſtood, leaſt that in ſtead of true doctrine, wee gather out of it a blaſphemous hereſie. For in trueth, God is no more a ſpirit, or an angell, (the which two words, are in diuinitie to be accounted of the ſame ſignification and compaſſe) then he is a ſoule or a bodie: what then may you ſay, is the ſignification of theſe words? Surely, they are not poſitiue, but priuatiue: they ſhew not

what God is, but what he is not, namely, that hee is not a formall, viſible, and ſenſible bodie. For ſo they containe in them, a refutation of that groſſe opinion of the carnall and hypocriticall Iewes, who thought that an outward and bodily worſhip, voyde of the ſpirituall ſinceritie of the heart, would well ynough fit and pleaſe God: as if a man hauing to deale with thoſe heatheniſh idolators, that thinke brute beaſtes or ſenceleſſe ſtockes to bee Gods, ſhould ſay vnto them, you are fouly deceiued in this point, for God is not a dead ſtocke, or a brute beaſt, but rather to be reſembled to a liuing man. So then, the meaning of Chriſtes words is this, God although in trueth hee bee not a ſpirit or an angell, yet becauſe that nature commeth nearer him, and doth more reſemble him then any other, therefore hee may fitly for your capacitie be ſo called.
               
               
                  
                  
                     Sect. 4.
                  YOu remember I doubt not, that it was ſaid, that there are three things required to the ſearching out of Gods nature: firſt, a conceite of it in the minde, gathered by the effects of it: ſecondly a reall example or patterne, wherein that conceit doth exiſt, and may bee ſeene: and thirdly, the difference betwixt the conceite & the example the one being in abſtracto, the other in concreto: the one exiſting onely in the imagination of the minde, the other in ſome creature and reall ſubiect. The two firſt wee haue alreadie gotten, the one out of the creatures, which haue taught vs the nature of God in generall, the other we haue found in the angels, who are a liuely reſemblance of the ſaid diuine nature: the third remaineth, to wit, the difference betwixt the patterne and the thing it ſelfe. For although we haue alreadie aſcended, and come to the higheſt ſteppe of Iacobs ladder, for that it is impoſsible to find any more of the diuine eſſence in any creature, then wee ha

                     e alreadie ſeene in the angelicall nature, yet wee are not at our iourneyes ende, nor yet halfe waye:

for although there be as great difference betwixt Angels and men, as there is diſtance betwixt the heauen and the earth, yet there is tenne times, yea ten thouſand times greater oddes betwixt the Angels and God, and the ſpace is infinitly greater from the heauen of the Angels and ſaints, to the heauen of heauens, where God dwelleth. And therefore we are now in the laſt place, to ſeeke out the difference, which exalteth the nature of God thus farre, or rather thus infinitly aboue the Angels: this is the verie true eſſentiall forme of God, the which if it could bee once named, the matter were at an ende, the caſe cleare, & much labor might be ſaued, which muſt be ſpent, or rather moſt profitably and happily beſtowed, in geſsing, coniecturing, & imagining that, by many properties, attributes, actions, and effects, which by this meanes might be fully knowne all at once. But it is not the will of God, neither were it profitable for vs, that ſo ineſtimable a iewell ſhould bee ſo eaſily gotten: who would eſteeme the moſt precious pearles, if ſo be that they lay in the ſtreetes for the vptaking? and if the nature of God were once fully known, how could it afterwardes bee ſo earneſtly ſought and deſired as is m
                        •
                     ete? Yet we are not to thinke that this impoſsibilitie of finding

out the true forme of God, commeth of God, as making daintie and daungerous of the knowledge of his nature, to make vs eager & earneſt in deſiring to know it, although i
                        •
                      bee true that hath beene ſaid, that it is better to haue our appetite whetted and ſharpned, by the hardneſſe and impoſsibilitie of attaining it, then our ſtomackes cloyed with the full fruition of it: neither are we to think that God doth enuie and grudge vs ſo great a good, and ſo ſweete a pleaſure, or that in pollicie hee keepeth himſelfe cloſe, not daring to ſhew himſelfe for feare of being cenſured or contemned by vs: But this commeth of the ſhallowneſſe of our braines, and the the weakneſſe of out capacitie, the which making it impoſsible for vs to conceiue it, maketh it impoſsible for God to reueale it.
                  
                     Gent.
                     I was in good hope to haue heard at the next word, the very true eſſential forme of God declared, and indeed that had beene woorth the hearing: but now I perceiue you will reſerue that for another time, or rather giue it ouer for euer: wherin you deale wiſely in my minde, for what follie were it for a man to beate his braines in purſuing that, which it were more then madneſſe once to hope to attaine. But I pray you, how wil you

do, to make your proude Lucifer a God.

                     We will doo as we may ſir: and if all ſhould faile, I hope that you will helpe at a dead lift, according to your promiſe: but to proceed. Seeing that the true forme of gods nature cannot be had, we muſt take in ſtead of it, ſome eſſentiall propertie flowing from the forme, the which will make thoſe things which are attributed to God, differ from the ſame things as they are in the Angels. For example, knowledge, wiſedome, might and maieſtie, haue place both in God, and alſo in the Angels, yet they are not alike in both: for in the Angels they are, although great and perfect, yet finit, but in god they are abſolute and infinit. So then, if we adde this difference of infinitneſſe to the Angelicall nature, there will come forth a diuine nature, which may not vnfitly be deſcribed an angelical nature euery way infinit: and ſo God be defined an infinit Angell, as an Angell may be ſaid to be a ſpiritual man. For as ſurpaſsing excellencie doth diſtinguiſh the Angelicall nature from the humane (for although they bee both of one kinde, to wit, reaſonable, indued with wit, knowledge, wiſedome, and will, yet they differ, in that the Angelicall nature hath all theſe in farre greater meaſur
                           •
                         then hath the humane) in like manner infinitneſſe

doth diſtinguiſh the diuine nature from the angelicall, for they both being reaſonable or vnderſtanding natures, indued with wit and will, and with all things belonging there vnto, differ in this reſpect, that the one is excellent in vnderſtāding, knowledge, wiſedome, will, power, puritie, and glorie, but the other is infinit in all theſe reſpects: the one hath all theſe things in an excellent meaſure, the other hath them without meaſure: the one hath much, the other hath all. And thus by gathering the nature of God out of his workes and word, by finding out a patterne of it in the Angelicall nature, and laſtly, by adding vnto this angelicall nature that wherein it commeth ſhort of God, we haue in ſome ſort made vp the diuine nature, or rather indeuoured to do that, which it is impoſsible to performe: for in this caſe, the leaſt glimſe of the truth is to be eſteemed knowledge.

                     Gent.
                     I Thanke you for this paines which you haue taken, in vnfolding this deepe and darke poynt of religion, the ground of all the reſt: Indeede I confeſſe, that as hee that goeth vppe to the toppe of the higheſt mountain in the world,

may farre better ſee and conſider the whole courſe and order of the ſtarres and heauens, then hee that lieth in the low valley, hauing his ſight hindered by trees, hils, cloudes, and other impediments: ſo he that hath his cogitations fixed on the celeſtiall Angels, the higheſt and excellenteſt of all creatures, may in them behold the diuine nature more clearly, then he that looketh onely vpon man, and other earthly creatures, in whom, although there bee ſome reſemblance of God, yet the groſſeneſſe, corruption, and mortalitie of their bodies, beeing betweene our ſight and the image of God in them, doth hinder vs from the cleare and plaine beholding of it. Yet for ſo much as fewe can clime vp to the toppe of this high hil, for that fewe off vs that are vnlearned, are ſo well acquainted with the angelicall nature, as to haue any certaine idea or notion of it ſetled in our mindes, I doubt that his demonſtration of the diuine nature by the angelicall, which indeed, and to thoſe that are learned, is the moſt fit and direct that can be imagined, will to vs (who for the moſt part either doubt whether there bee any ſuch thing as an Angel in the world, or if we beleeue the ſcripture, telling vs that there are ſuch ſpiritual creatures, yet we know no further of them, thē as we haue ſeen them

painted on ſignes with a paire of wings) will ſeem obſcurum per obſcurum, if not per obſcurius: for that it will be as hard for thē to ſuppoſe what an Angell is, as what God is. And therefore mee thinkes I could wiſh, that the diuine nature could be declared and ſhadowed out vnto vs, by ſome other nature better known & more familiar vnto vs. Sch. It were dangerous, as that which might be an occaſion of idolatrie vnto vs, to take ſo great libertie in imagining the nature of God, as to reſemble him to any viſible thing: neither were it agreeable to the nature of God, who is inuiſible: & we know, that of all bodely creatures, there is none by nature inuiſible, ſaue onely the ayre. And ſurely if we muſt needs in reſpect of the vulgar capacitie, or rather dulneſſe & want of vnderſtanding haue ſome familiar and eaſie example & reſemblance of the diuine nature, in my mind there is no elementarie creature ſo fit for this purpoſe, as is this, which wee haue light on. For firſt, as no man doubteth but that this element of ye
                         ayre doth truly & ſubſtantially exiſt, although it cannot poſsibly be ſeene, no more are we to doubt, but that God doth moſt certainly exiſt, al though he cānot poſsibly be viſibly ſeen. Thus doth Chriſt Ioh. 3. 8. by the inuiſibilitie of the winde, teach Nicodemus the ſecrecie of the ſpirit of God.
                     
                        
                        The wind bloweth whither it liſteth, thou heareſt the ſound of it, but knoweſt not whence it commeth, nor whither it goeth: euen ſo is euery one that is borne of the ſpirit, or ſo ſecret is the operation of Gods ſpirit in reneuing men. And without queſtion, it is the ſafer and the better courſe, whenſoeuer we thinke of God, and therfore muſt of neceſsitie coin in our minds ſome idea or forme of him, to reſemble him to this inuiſible bodie, then to any beaſt or man, to the ſunne, moone, ſtarres, or any other viſible creature. Againe, this element doth, (the which neither Angell, man, beaſt, nor any other creature can) very notably repreſent vnto vs the vbiquitie of God? for it is euery where, in euery open place & ſecret corner, in the towne, in the fields, and in the wideſt deſerts: in the bowels of the earth, and in the bottome of the ſea: within & without vs, yea inſeparably cloſing and compaſsing vs about. So that if we doo but ſtretch this element vp to the heauens, ſuppoſing them to be made of this matter, (as ſure the matter of thē is not much vnlike, neither can we more probably compare it to any thing, then to a pure and firme kind of ayre) & ſo in imagination aboue the higheſt heauens (although in truth, there be there neither ayre, bodie, nor place) we ſhall truly & plainly conceiue of the vbiquitie of god. A point of doctrine very needneedfull

to be plainly declared & truly learned, for that moſt men doo greatly and in truth very groſſely erre in it, by tying god to one certaine place, and ſhutting him vp in heauen, as it were a Bee in a Box, for that the Scripture doth often aſsigne vnto him that place: not meaning that he in eſſence is there, more thē in this inferior world, but that there his glorie and maieſtie do mote clearly ſhine▪ From this foule error, another farre woorſe doth ſpring, for by this meanes they exclude both God and his prouidence out of the world, & caſt off all feare

                        ſent, & by the wals, doores, and windowes of their cloſets and chambers, kept from ſeeing or knowing their doings: whereas on the other ſide, if they were perſwaded of his vbiquitie & preſence in all places, that he doth immediately compaſſe them about, as doth the aire, & ſitteth as cloſely to them, as their ſhirts doo to their backes: yea that he hath place euen in their minds and hearts, as certainly as they do continually drawe the ayre into their brains, and bodies, it could not bee but that they ſhould continually ſtand in awe of him.
                     So then, (to let paſſe without any inlarging,) diuers other reſpects, in the which this Element doth not vnfitly repreſent

vnto vs ſome properties and attributes of the diuine nature, as that it is moſt mightie, making the verie earth to ſhake, and rocking it too and fro like a little childe in a cradle, that it is moſt ſubtile, pearcing into euery place, and paſsing through the leaſt cracke and narroweſt crannie or chinke: that it is the beginning of things, if we thinke as ſome Philoſophers haue done, that it is the firſt matter whereof being thickned and compacted togither, the water and other things were made: that it is the preſeruer of our life, for that without it we cānot continue any ſpace, but do preſently periſh: ſo that we may truly ſay of it, as the Apoſtle ſaith of the diuine nature, Act. 17. 28. In it we liue, we mooue, and haue our beeing. But to let theſe things paſſe thus briefly▪ if wee ſuppoſe a thouſand worlds one aboue another, all of them repleniſhed, with thi
                           •
                         primarie, pure, ſimple, ſubtile, pearching, inuiſible, yea inſenſible, (for of it ſelfe, not affected or diſtempered by any accidentall qualitie, it is neither ſeene, heard, taſted, ſmelt, nor felt) this mightie, large, & vniuerſal creature, we ſhall haue a pretie patterne and reſemblance of the infinitneſſe, vbiquitie, inuiſibilitie, pure ſimplicitie, and pearcing ſubtiltie of the diuine nature: for as I haue often told you, we doo not make any

compariſon betweene this or any other creature, and God the Creator, but onely a reſemblance, which may bee, where there is no ſhewe of equalitie. As in this inſtance the ayre is to our ſence and capacitie, and in reſpect of other creatures, ſubtile, ſimple, pearching, inſenſible, mightie, large, and vniuerſall: but in compariſon of the diuine nature, it is more groſſe, confuſed, blunt, palpable, weake, narrowe, and wanting, then can bee ſaid. And therefore in reſembling God in word or in imagination, either to Angels, or to the ayre, wee muſt remember to adde the difference, for otherwiſe wee commit groſſe and hainous idolatrie. For there is no creature in the world, which howſoeuer it be perfect in the owne nature, yet if it be vſed as a reſemblance of God, will not bee found wanting in many reſpects. Man is indeed the image of God, yet he is too little and weak, to fill his chaire of eſtate, yea indeede too groſſe for that purpoſe, how ſoeuer it hath pleaſed Gnd ſometimes to reueale himſelfe to Moſes, Daniell, Eſay, Exechiell, and other of his Prophets, in the likeneſſe of a man, for ſome reſpect and ſignification. The Angels are not litle, weake, and groſſe as man is, yet before we can make them a fit type of God, me muſt ſtretch them far beyond their owne

compaſſe, euen throughout the whole world. The aire is large and vniuerſal, but it wanteth life, ſence, and an internall beginning of motion: howſoeuer it moue as nimbly as if it had a thouſand liues: annd therefore to make it a fit reſemblance of God, wee muſt inſpire it with life, or rather (if we thinke that life is not properly attributed to God) with reaſon and vnderſtanding, the which without queſtion doth moſt properly and eſſentially belong to God. And ſo we may for the weake capacitie of the vnlearned, deſcribe God, ſuppoſing him to bee a reaſonable element of aire, as before to the vnderſtanding of the learned, wee made him to bee an infinit Angell. Thus to make vp and finiſh this patterne and picture of God, we are conſtrained to imitate Apelles that famous Painter, who going about and enterpriſing by the curioſitie of his art and cunning, to counterfaite, yea to ſurpaſſe the perfection of naturall bewtie, would not inſiſt in any one particular, but out of diuerſe perſons, made choiſe of that, which in each one of them ſeemed moſt excellent: taking from one the complection and colour of the eye and haire, from an other the forme and ſtraightneſſe of the noſe: from the third the breadth and largeneſſe of the forehead, & ſo forth, in all the other parts of the viſage, vntill at length, with much ado, he got togither

into one face or countenance an exquiſit and abſolute, idea of bewtie. In like manner we are not to thinke that any one creature is able to affoord ſufficient matter, whereof to make this infinite Image, that doth fill both heauen and earth, or that the ſhop of any creature (how excellent ſo euer) hath ſufficient varietie of colours, wherewith to ſet it forth, as the dignitie of it doth require: it is well, if that all the perfections of all the creatures in the world, brought togither into one picture, do make but a reſonable reſemblance of him.
                  
                  
                     Gent.
                     Indeed, I muſt needs confeſſe, that you haue now fitted me a penney worth, & ſerued me in my kinde: and as I cannot truly call my ſelfe either learned or altogithe vnlearned (for I went long to the Grammer ſchoole and I was a yeare or two at the Vniuerſitie, before I went to the Innes of Court) but rather a mungrell betwixt both, ſo now I may chuſe, of whether ſide and ſect I wll be: and ſo worſhip, either the ayre with the common people, or with the learned your aſſpiring Lucifer, climbing vp to the throne of god. Yet by your patiēce, as touching your ayerie god, although I confeſſe that element to bee fitter then any other of theſe elementarie bodies, yet me thinks, ye
                         the element of the fire wold haue ſerued your turne better: conſidering that it is both far larger, as beeing higher, as

alſo farre more ſubtile and ſimple, more piercing and forceable, then is the miſty and fogayre, as all men know and confeſſe. Neither can you take exception againſt the viſibilitie of it, as you make it very dangerous, and a great occaſion of Idolatry, to reſemble God to any viſible thing: for although our fyre here below, being compoſed of all the other elements, bee viſible and ſenſible, yet the element of fire as it is in the proper place and ſphere, we ſee to be inuiſible.

                     The ſame reaſon that would not ſuffer you to reſt contented in the ſimilitude of the Angels, becauſe as you ſay truly, their nature is greatly doubted of among the ignorant people, and in a manner vnknowne to the wiſeſt, and therefore, it being darke and obſcure in it ſelfe, is not fit to giue light to any other thing: ſo I ſay of your fierie element, that although the Philoſophers prooue by good reaſons, that howſoeuer it wete neuer ſeene, yet there is ſome ſuch thing truly exiſting: for that otherwiſe there cannot bee that perfect quaternitie and correſpondency of primarie qualities, which is needfull in the mixture of theſe inferiour bodies: yet for as much as it is not ſo certain, but that ſome who thought themſelues to be Philoſophers, haue doubted of it, and much more the common

people, who do not weigh reaſons, nor admit any other euidences for the proofe of the true and lawfull tytles of aſſertions, ſaue onely their owne ſences, I thought, that I ſhould fit your humour, and fulfill your requeſt: which was, to haue a plaine and popular demonſtration of the nature of God, not ſo well by this vnknowne and inſenſible element of fire, as with that other of the aire, with the which, as with a daily companion and friend, that will not be kept out a dores, nor yet out from our hearts, we are ſo familiarly and ſo entirely acquainted.

                     Sch.
                     I will be ſo far from thinking it boldneſſe, that I ſhall thinke my ſelfe much beholden to you for ſo doing: yea it is a thing which both I may and do challenge of you,

and you are bound by promiſe to performe: for I did not take vppon mee to deliuer the whole truth of this doctrine as it were to ſpeake vndoubted oracles, but rather in hope that by our mutuall helping one another, where eyther of vs ſhould chaunc

                        ifte out ſome part of the truth of this vnſearchable miſtery by our familiar reaſoning too and fro of matters: and therefore, I can bee well content, to bee admoniſhed, where I go aſtray.
                  
                  
                     Gent.
                     Then to tell you plainly, me thinkes that although theſe definitions which you bring, may haue in them ſome ſubſtance of trueth, and alſo ſome plauſible ſhewe of popular facilitie, which I wil not denie, yet they haue no Art in the world in them, and for that cauſe are not onely not curious, but euen confuſed and obſcure, and want that euidencie, which you ſeemed in framing them wholly to affect.
                     I haue heard and read many diſcourſes of this matter, yet neuer knew I any take ſuch a courſe, as to define one thing by another, and to inmble vp into one definition, things of diuers natures, as you do in defining god, to bee an infinit Angell, or a reaſonable aire: for thus you make a mōſter of him, as it were

an Hermaphrodite, halfe of one nature, and halfe of another, halfe reaſonable, and halfe vnreaſonable. You deale with me as men do with naturall fooles, when they cannot make them conceiue that three and foure make ſeuen, but by a mathematicall demonſtration, ſetting ſeuen leauen horſe loanes one vppon another: ſo you heap vp diuers particulars in ſtead of one generall. It had beene a better courſe, if according to the olde and ordinarie manner of handling and defining, in the firſt place you had ſought out the generall kinde or nature: (which you in the Schooler call the Genus in definition) to the which the diuine nature doth belōg, & is to be reſerred, & thē to haue added either the proper form, or (if that could not be found, as I think that in this caſe it cannot) ſom formal proopertie, pointing as it were with the finger at the vnknowne forme. As in this example, you haue found out of Act. 17. 29. the Genus or kind of God, to wit, that hee is of the ſame kinde and nature that man is, in reſpect not of his bodie, but of his ſoule: and indeede ſo hee is, God is of a reaſonable nature, for 
                           •
                        ee hath knowledge, wiſedome, and will, 
                           〈◊〉
                         which cannot haue place but in a reaſo

Now thisis but the genus of the definitiō, for both men and Angels are reaſonable natures, and therefore you muſt adde the difference, which diſtinguiſheth God from al other reaſonable natures: but how can you make this infinitneſſe to containe in it, all the attributes of Gods nature I ſee not as yet: and ſo you define God infinit reaſon, or the infinit reaſoble nature. But I pray you proceed in declaring it, and pardon my boldneſſe in telling you my fooliſh opinion thus plainely.

                     It is not ſo eaſie for a man to doo right himſelfe, as it is to finde fault with an other, as it may bee you will confeſſe anon, when we chaunge places, and you become the ſpeaker, and I the cenſurer. I know that definitions ſhould conſiſt of one generall notion, not of diuers particular inſtances, yea I could haue done thus much my ſelfe, for it is nothing: but vpon yourmotion and requeſt I tooke that other courſe, which if it be rude and voyd of art, blame your ſelfe, who were the procurer of it: yea I did meane to bring at length, the proper and true definition, void of all metaphoricall ſimilitudes, as namely that God is as you ſay, infinit reaſon, or r

                         fitteſt definition of him, that I can now think of. Yet ſurely for my owne part, I doo not ſo

much truſt my owne wit in conceiuing aright of the nature of God, but that I ſhould bee glad in learning it, to haue the helpe of a type or particular example to direct me. But in one thing, you do me manifeſt wrong, in that you ſay, that I make a monſter of the diuine nature, compounding it of the Angelical, humane, and elementarie natures. I dare warrant you, that the differēce which was broght, to wit, infiniteneſſe, being put to the definitions, or to the aforeſaid natures, will ſo purge them, that there ſhall not be one dramme of the droſſe of any created nature left in them. Yea, try it when you will, and you ſhall finde it to bee the right Philoſophers ſtone, which turneth all mettalles into golde, and that one dramme of it being put, not onely to an Angell, or to a whole element, but euen to the leaſt flye in the world, or the leaſt mote in the Sunne, is of force to make it true and very god.
                     For firſt it maketh it to bee the primary and authenticall nature, or (if this word import generatiō to the eare of a curious grammatiſt) the firſt eſſence deriued from none other, for then it was contained in that other, and then it was finite, for the thing containing, is the limit and bounds of that which is contained.
                     
                        
Secondly, this infinitneſſe maketh it to be but one, becauſe there cannot be two infinits: for wher there are two, there is diuiſion of ye
                         one frō the other: & where there is diuiſion, there is the end of the one, and the beginning of an other, and ſo no infinit. Thirdly, infinitnes maketh the ſubiect to be immateriall, and incorporeall, for no matter or bodie can be infinit, for a bodie is of neceſsitie contained and circumſcribed by a place, but if it be contained, then it is not infinit: whereof it followeth, that the infinit thing being without matter, is alſo without paſsion, for ſola materia patitur: and ſo it be commeth alſo immutable, for there can be no change without paſsion. Fourthly, infinitneſſe maketh a thing to bee immooueable, for whatſoeuer mooueth, hath terminos, a quo & ad que
                              •
                           , that is, it mooueth hither and thither, but in infini
                           
                              •
                           o non ſunt termini. And laſtly, the infinite thing is ſimple, voyde of all manner of compoſition: for in compoſition there is diuiſion and qualitie, and ſo by conſequent, there are limits. And thus we are to thinke of the diuine nature, that although it be of the kind of reaſonable natures as ſome creatures are, yet in that it onely is infinit, it is ſufficiently diſtinguiſhed from them all: and is made firſt primarie or authenticall, without cauſe or beginning, but exiſting abſolutely in himſelfe,

and of himſelfe. Yea as he is himſelfe without cauſe, or beginning, ſo hee is to all the other things, the cauſe and beginning: hee is the roote and fountaine, from the which all natures and beings, do ſpring and proceed: comming from him, yet not diminiſhing him, hauing all their eſſence, but no part of his eſſence from him. For this alſo is a proper effect of the infinite, to be the originall of all things, the which if they came from any finite thing, they ſhould at length draw it drie, and ſo the nature or beeing of all the things in the world ſhould periſh, or beeing preſerued by mutuall tranſinutation, yet they want an omnipotent agent to begin them. For (by the confeſsion of all men) the firſt creation of the world, requireth a power not limited, but infinit, for that it is impoſsible to any finite power, to create: that is, to make ſomething of nothing: & if the power be infinit, the ſubiect wherein it is, muſt be of the ſame nature. Again, God is one and but one, becauſe he is God, to wit, that infint nature, which is ſufficient of it ſelf, to occupie, & fill ten thouſand wordls: neither can abide to be iuſtled by a pewfellow, but muſt ſit and raigne alone: this point of doctrine the whole world, euen the Iewes and Turkes do hold, abhorring all ſound or ſhew of any pluralitie of Gods.
                     
                        
Again, God is immateriall and incorporeall, not exiſting as we do in earthly and corruptible bodies, or as the Angels doo in ſome more pure, ſolide and firme ſubiects, which may in ſome ſenſe bee called bodies, or in the moſt ſubtile and pure matter that can be imagined, but as a pure actuall and ſubſtantiall forme, ſubſiſting of it ſelfe. And therefore we are (interpreting euery doubtfull thing, in the beſt ſenſe) to thinke that Tertullian giuing a body not onely to the Angels, but euen to God himſelfe, ment him to be not a phantaſticall imagination, or an accidentall qualitie of ſome other thing, but a true, real, ſubſtantiall, and eſſentiall nature, ſubſiſting as truly and really as doth a body which we ſee and feele. Otherwiſe, by giuing God a body, we take from him his infinitneſſe, & ſo his diuine nature, making him locall, mutable and mooueable. The which are in no caſe to bee admitted: for God is not contained in any place, but containeth in himſelfe all places, bodies and natures whatſoeuer, 1, King. 8. 27. How ſhall God dwell in this houſe, when as the heauen of heauens cannot containe and comprehend him? Neither is he ſubiect to mutation, paſsion or alteration, as he ſhould of neceſsitie bee, if hee were materiall, but is the ſame this day, and

yeſterday, now and for euer.
                     Laſtly, we are not to admit motion in the diuine nature, for that in motion, there is a poſsibilitie of good, or ſome degree of perfection, which is not yet in act, nor attained vnto, and ſo there would be imperfection in God: but the diuine nature is not in any mouing poſſibilitie tending to any other ſtate, but is euer in complete act and in abſolute perfection, and reſteth and remaineth in it ſelfe without motion, far more firme, and ſtedfaſt, then is any Rocke in the ſea, or the earth or whatſoeuer can be imagined moſt immooueable: moouing all things, yet hee himſelfe reſting, for all things tend to him, but he to nothing. Laſtly, the diuine nature is moſt ſimple and vniforme, all alike throughout all: voyde of all mixture, compoſition, combination, diuiſion or diſsimilitude.
                     It is not compounded of matter and forme, for it is a forme needing no matter, wherewith to be vpheld, or wherein to exiſt, but vpholdeth it ſelfe, and ſubſiſteth in it ſelfe: In it there is not cauſe and effect, for it is an efficient without an effect, and of that which is no effect, euen of it ſelfe: It is a totum, a whole without parts, for it is euery where

the ſame, and like it ſelf, or rather it ſelfe, and therefore cannot bee diuerſely diuided, or diſtinguiſhed into parts: and if our finite cogitations muſt needs make him haue parts, & conceiue him by peecemeale and parts, becauſe wee cannot take the whole, then muſt wee needes make euery part to bee the whole: and laſtly, it is a ſubſtance without accidents, for nothing can either accidere or accedere to that which already is all and infinit, neither doth it, as other ſubſtances do, extenuate it ſelfe into accidentall qualities, but whatſoeuer it ſendeth foorth from it ſelfe (or rather to it ſelfe, for from it ſelfe it cannot go) that is it ſelfe, not any way extenuated, but remaining in the ſame plight, which it had before.

                     Gent.
                     
                        HItherto you had my cōpany, and I was glad of yours, but ſince you entered into the handling of this infinitnes, which you make the difference of the diuine nature, diſtinguiſhing it from other reaſonable natures, you haue flowen ſo cleane out of my ſight, that I haue no hope of ourtaking you. For if you thus exempt Gods nature from all logicall relation of ſubſtance and accident, of ſubiect & adiunct, of eſſence and attributes, by the which diſtinction, it is (as you know) vſually declared and laid opē, you will take away all meanes, eyther of teaching, or of learning and conceiuing it.
                  
                  
                     Sch.
                     You miſtake my meaning, which was not to exempt God from all logicall relation, and the groundes and rules of reaſon, without the which, I confeſſe, that

neither the diuine, nor any other nature, can bee either declared or learned, or in truth exiſt in it ſelfe. For reaſon and logicke, which is the act and operation of reaſon, ſtretch themſelues ouer all things that exiſt, howſoeuer they exiſt whether finitely or infinitely, although (in vs) it cannot fully comprehend, that which is infinite, yea and a little further too, euen to thoſe things, which doo not exiſt. As for the diuine nature, it is as hath bene ſaid, an eſſentiall and infinite reaſon, or vnderſtanding, euen the fonndation and fountaine of all reaſon: and therefore, wee cannot thinke that it ſhould aboliſh or deſtroy reaſon, for ſo it ſhould deſtroy it ſelf: but rather are to acknowledge that it doth eſtabliſh it, and agree vnto it. Indeede the grounds and principles of naturall Philoſophie, as they haue bene laid downe by heathen Philoſophers (who hauing little or no knowledge of God, had the more leiſure to looke into naturall things) doo fight with the grounds of diuinitie, and by not admitting any actuall infinite, do deſtroy the nature of god, as in other points we know, that the beſt Philoſopher that euer was, was but a ſory diuine, yet we may not in any wiſe thinke, that reaſon and diuinitie doo iarre or croſſe each one the other, the which indeede are

both one in effect: and therefore neither I, nor any other (vnleſſe he be voyde both of naturall & alſo of artificial logick) can doubt or denie that God hath ſubſtance, eſſence, nature, forme, yea his proper attributes and effects: and the diſtinction of eſſence and attributes, which all Diuines make in handling the nature of god, is good & true. They deny indeed, that there are any accidents in God, and ſay that whatſoeuer is in God, is the eſſence of God, but then they meane by accidents, ſeparable and mutable qualities, and by eſſence, eſſentiall and inſeparable properties.
                     So there are no accidents in God, as in a man or an Angell are knowledge, wiſedome, puritie, holineſſe, ſtrength, and happineſſe, which are no part of their nature or eſſence, nor yet eſſentiall properties, for they may be remoued and ſeparated from their ſubiects, as we know that many both men and angels are ignorant, fooliſh, wicked, vile, weak and miſerable: but nothing that is in god, or doth belong vnto him, can be augmented, diminiſhed, or any way altered, for as hee is once at any time, ſo is he alwaies at all times. Yet it cānot be denied, but that god hath his eſſentiall properties or attributes, and that they are and may be truly and really diſtinguiſhed

from his ſubſtance, eſſence, or forme, and ſome things (I confeſſe) are attributed to God, in reſpect of our weakneſſe, which are not proper, but rather contrarie vnto the nature of God, as namely, the parts and ſences of mans bodie, as hands, eyes, feete, going, ſeeing, and likewiſe the paſsions and perturbations of men, as anger, furie, hatred, reuenge, repenting, forgetfulneſſe, and diuers other: all which are as farre diſcrepant from the nature of god, as darkneſſe is from light: and therefore they are to bee vnderſtood as improper, and metaphoricall ſpeeches, borrowed from our nature, to repreſent & make knowne vnto vs, the diuers actions of God. Againe, God is the Creator, Preſeruer and Redeemer of the world: theſe attributes and many others of the ſame kind, are truly giuen to him, yet they are not to bee accounted his eſſential attributes, becauſe they are not coeternall with God: therefore not inſeparable, although creation import omnipotencie, and ſo an eſſentiall attribute. Beſides, there are diuers other things attributed to God, but the true and eſſentiall attributes of God, are thoſe which ariſe and ſpring from his eſſence and forme, as naturally, neceſſarely, directly, continually, and immediately as the beames, light and heate iſſue from the ſun,

yea as do the ſtreams from a fountain, & the twigges and branches, from the roote and bodie of the tree: as namely, vbiquitie, eternitie, vnitie, ſimplicitie, & omnipo
                           •
                        ēcie, theſe are y•
                         eſſential attributes of god, ariſing neceſſarely from his eſſentiall forme: to wit, from an infinit vnderſtanding and reaſon, (the which we are conſtrained to make the ſubſtitute and vicegerent of the eſſentiall forme of God) the which muſt of neceſsitie (as hath been ſaid and ſhewed) bee eternall, illocall, one, ſimple and omnipotent, yea omniſcient and infinit in many other reſpects: yet theſe attributes are not the eſſence and forme of God, for they are diuers one from each other, as vbiquitie is not vnitie, nor vnitie eternitie, but the eſſence of God is not diuers.
                  
                  
                     Gent.
                     The difference which you make betwixt the eſſence and eſſentiall properties of God, as I take it, is this: that the eſſence is as it were the foundation, fountaine, ſubſtance, head, beginning, and roote, and the attributes, the top, ſtreames, exiſtence, inferior members, end, fruite and in briefe, they come from the eſſence of God: is not this your meaning?
                  
                  
                     Sch.
                     You ſay true, and I thanke you for explaining it more fully then I could haue done: but what of that?
                  
                  
                     
                     Gent.
                     Then I pray you let me aske you this queſtion, why may you not make ſome or all of the atttributes, the eſſence and forme of God, as well as the infinit vnderſtanding of God, or at the leaſt, why doo you not make the vnderſtanding of God one of his attributes, as I am ſure that vſually Diuines doo, who put the knowledge and wiſedome of God in the forefront of his attributes? I might trouble you with other obiections, for by this diſtinction of Gods eſſence from his attributes, you ſeeme to make prius and poſterius, one thing before an other in God: and alſo to take away the vniformitie and equalitie of Gods eſſence, for that the beginning, roote, and head, is more eſſentiall, then the progreſſe, fruites and members: but I knowe you would ſay, that I doo but cauill and trifle with you: for that it is no abſurditie to ſay, that in God one thing is before another, in order, though not in time, as the vnderſtanding is to the will: and to the other you may ſay, that ye
                         head is no more eſſential to a man then is the foote, nor the roote, then a little twig, and therefore I pray you, reſolue mee for that other matter, and let theſe paſſe.
                  
                  
                     Sch.
                     You might haue let that paſſe too, for any great hardneſſe that is in it: as wil plainly appeare, if you conſider the ſame diſtinction

in men, or rather in Angels, fo
                           •
                         they haue eſſentiall attributes proportionable (though not comparable) to theſe in God: for they haue ſucceſsiue vbiquitie (for they can be any where in a ſmall ſpace of time: and for the eternitie, or rather ſempiternitie of god, they haue immortalitie: for his ſimplicitie, they haue great ſubtiltie: and for his omnipotencie, great power and might: yet the beginning and foundation of their eſſence is in none of theſe, but in their reaſon or vnderſtanding, the which onely giueth the denominatiō of a perſō to the ſubiect in the which it is, whether it be in the creatures or in god. Yea, it doth more properly make the ſubiect excellent, then doth any other reſpect: as namely, a man indued with vnderſtanding, hath more of the image and ſimilitude of God, and is in that reſpect more excellent then is the whole earth, being but a dead and ſenceleſſe lumpe of clay, as it is ſaid Eccleſ. 9. 4. That a quick dog is better thē a dead Lyon, and as wee know, that the leaſt bird that flyeth in the ayre, is more admired, & counted more excellent, then the hugeſt mountaine in the world that ſtandeth ſtone-ſti
                           •
                        . So that liuing things excel thoſe which wāt life, as reaſonable men excell brute beaſts, as wiſe men excell fooles, as much as light doth darkneſſe,

                        Eccleſ. 2. 13. as Angels ſurpaſſe men, as farre as the heauen doth the earth, in puritie and ſubtilitie, ſo doth the infinitneſſe of Gods vnderſtanding, (not of his quantitie, time or power) extoll God aboue all things, and in the firſt place makes him God. As for the methode which diuers Diuines vſe, in putting the knowledge and wiſedome of God among his attributes, in that they put them in the forefront of them, as you ſaye truly, it is plaine that they make them the beginning and foundation of the reſt: yea, I could ſhewe you ſome of the lateſt of them, which make the knowledge and wiſedome of God to be his life: and by life wee knowe that all things are ſaide to exiſt. And therefore, howſoeuer it bee impoſsible for vs to ſound the depth of the diuine eſſence, and to ſhew fully and plainly, wherin the form of it doth conſiſt, yet forſomuch as wee need not doubt, but that of all that is in ſcripture attributed to God, and ſaid to be in him, his infinit vnderſtanding hath the firſt place, both in excellencie, and alſo in order of nature, we may be bold to make it the roote, fountaine, and foundation of his eſſence, and the reſt of his attributes the branches, ſtreames, and progreſſe of it. For in the firſt place God is a ſubſtance, nature or eſſence, truely ſubſiſting:

then he is to be accounted, not a dead and vnreaſonable, but a reaſonable and vnderſtanding nature: thirdly, not a finit, but an infinit vnderſtanding, whereof it followeth, that he is eternall, illocall, ſimple, one and omnipotent.
                  
                  
                     Gent.
                     Now I do perceiue your meaning, neither will I gaineſay it, or deny but that God is to be thought to be an vnderſtanding nature or eſſence, and that infinit, hauing the aforeſaid attributes belonging vnto it: But whether ſhall the vnderſtanding or the infinitneſſe of God haue the firſt place aſsigned vnto it?
                  
                  
                     Sch.
                     Theſe two can no more be ſeuered, then can the fire and heate, neither is the one before the other in time, nature, or beeing, both exiſting togither eternally: yet in the order of logicall relations and reſpects, as god is an eſſence before hee is an vnderſtanding eſſence, ſo is he an vnderſtanding or reaſonable nature, before he is infinit. Neither are we to thinke, that the eſſence of God conſiſteth ſimply in infinitneſſe, but in an vnderſtanding, or (if any other thing can bee named, which commeth nearer to the eſſence of God) in ſome other thing, that is infinit: for the eſſence of God is not priuatiue onely, but moſt truly and properly poſitiue.

                     Gent.
                     YOu haue ſatiſfied me fully, and I thanke you heartily for your paines, in explaining vnto mee that poynt of religion, which of all other I haue alwaies deſired to haueſom inſight into: nether do I know what now to deſire of you, vnleſſe it pleaſe you to go on in the particular explication of theſe attributes of the diuine nature, and to beginne with the vnderſtanding which you make not an attribute, bur rather the very eſſence of God, or at the leaſt, that which commeth nearer vnto it, then any other thing doth that we know.
                  
                  
                     Sch.
                     Indeed the firſt place in the treatiſe of Gods nature, is woorthily aſsigned to his knowledge, or rather to his eſſentiall vnderſtanding, the which muſt either bee made Gods eſſence, or elſe wee muſt confeſſe that we knowe not what itis, or wherein it doth conſiſt: but to declare the true nature & manner of it, is as farre aboue my reach, as the heauen is aboue my head. Yet ſome little knowledge of it, the ſcripture doth affoord vs, to this effect, that the knowledge, reaſon, or vnderſtāding of god, is his infinit eſſence, knowing all things actually alwaies.
                  
                  
                     
                     Gent.
                     Doo you make the knowledge and the vnderſtanding of God, to be all one, or is there ſome difference betwixt them?
                  
                  
                     Sch.
                     I doo meane but one thing by them both, to wit, that part (for ſo I may ſpeak tho improperly) of Gods eſſence, which in order hath the firſt place: and I thought it beſt to vſe diuers words, to ſignifie one thing for plaineſſe, and the greater euidence of the matter: for the one, to wit, knowledge, is the more vſuall terme, and yet the other ſeemeth to be the more proper and ſignificant. For as in a man or Angel, knowledge is one thing, euen a ſeparable or accidental qualitie, which is often wanting, as wee ſee in many men, who are (in a manner) altogither deſtitute of knowledge: and the minde, vnderſtanding, or reaſonable ſoule, another thing, to wit, the very eſſentiall forme: ſo in God we may ſay that the ſame thing is both his vnderſtāding, as it ſubſiſteth in it ſelfe, and alſo his knowledge, as it hath relation to other things, namely to the creatures: and ſo knoledge as it is in the creature a ſeparable or accidentall qualitie, ſo in God (in whom there is no mutation) it is an eſſentiall attribute ariſing from his vnderſtanding, which is his eſſence. For if the world had neuer beene made, nor to haue beene made, wee could not in proper

ſpeech haue ſaide that God had the knoweledge of it, for ſo he ſhuld haue known that which was not: but that cannot be: for things which neuer exiſt, are neuer knowne in particular, howſoeuer they might and ſhould haue beene knowne in abſtract and generall notions. So that the knowledge of God properly taken, & preciſely diſtinguiſhed from his vnderſtanding, is his vnderſtāding actuated or broght into act, yet not ſo large as is his vnderſtanding, which is infinit, wheras gods knowledge of the world or of the creatures, neyther is nor can bee infinit, for that God neyther hath alreadie created infinite particulars, neyther yet in trueth can doo it, becauſe ſo there ſhould bee two infinits, one created or made, and the other the maker of it: for howſoeuer to our weake vnderſtanſtandings, not onely all the particulars which haue happened or ſhall happen in the world, but euen a aſmall part or portion of them, ſeeme infinit, yet to God, they altogither are finite and numerable.
                  
                  
                     Gent.
                     You ſeem to make the knowledge of God to be his vnderſtanding, not as it is ſubſiſteth in it ſelfe, but as it is actuated and hath relation to the things that are knowne.
                     
                        
But by this meanes you incurre two great inconueniences: firſt in making it finite, the which you confeſſe, although in my minde it is not to bee admitted, for all Diuines make the knowledge of God infinit: and ſecondly, in making it to bee accidentall, and not of abſolute neceſsit
                           •
                         in God. This will plainly followe, if the knowledge of God be limitted to the things in the world which are knowne: for although it was neceſſary that the world ſhould be created, God hauing ſo decreed, yet this neceſsitie is not abſolute, becauſe God might haue exiſted, though hee had neuer made the world, and then hee ſhould haue wanted this knowledge of things, becauſe the thinges themſelues were wanting.
                     This ſuppoſall is not altogither vain
                           •
                         and friuilous, for God as hee did exiſt without the world, before the creation of it, ſo wee cannot doubt, but that hee might haue done ſo ſtill and for euer: otherwiſe wee ſhould fall into that groſſe abſurditie of ſome Philoſophers: who to make the world eternall, make it eſſentiall to God, and to follow him as neceſſarely, inſeparably, and as wee ſay, as hard at heeles, as the ſhadow doth the body, the which I doubt not, but you condemne as moſt abſurd.
                     
                        
We are rather (in my mind) & ſo others alſo thinke and write) to acknowledge not one
                           •
                        y the vnderſtanding, but euen the knowledge of God to be infinit, in that it ſtretcheth it ſelfe not onely to the creatures, but euen to God himſelfe: whereof it will followe, that it is both infinit, (for whatſoeuer knoweth and comprehendeth that which is infinit, is it ſelfe infinite) and alſo eſſentiall to God, becauſe it is not onely eternall, as is the knowledge of the creatures in God (although it bee not of abſolute neceſsitie) but alſo abſolutely neceſſary, becauſe it cannot bee ſuppoſed, that God could exiſt without the knowledge of himſelfe. Yet I will not wholly reiect or deny this deſtinction which you make of the vnderſtanding of God from his knowledge: for although of all Gods attributes, his knowledge doth moſt properly and immediately flow from his vnderſtanding, yet me thinkes that there is a difference to bee put betwixt God and his knowledge, as well as betwixt God and his power: yet for ſo much as through ignorance of Gods true forme, wee are not able to declare the nature of his eſſentiall vnderſtanding, (the which we are conſtrained to put in the place of his forme) heereof it cōmeth, that we are not able to diſtinguiſh this eſſentiall vnderſtanding

of god from his actuall knowledge. And therefore leauing the knowledg of gods forme; eſſence, and (as wee make it) of his eſſential vnderſtanding to himſelfe, who only eyther doth or can knowe it, let vs I pray you, proceed in conſidering this his actuall knowledge.

It was ſaid of God, that he knoweth all things actuallly, alwaies. For the firſt, it is plain and not greatly doubted of by any, that all the actions of the creatures, and whatſoeuer doth any way happen vnto them, is as manifeſt vnto God, as is the ſunne at noone: he doth ſee with eyes, which need no light, for darkneſſe and light are all one to him: the heart of man is deepe and deceitfull aboue all things, yet hee ſoundeth the depth of it, ſeeing and perceiuing his moſt ſecret thoughts, as plainly as if they were things done in the ſight of the whole world: the which thing, although it ſeeme moſt impoſsible, and bee incredible to many, yet wee knowe

alſo by manifolde experience: and no maruell, ſeeing that he hath framed and faſhioned them, hee hath made the eye and care, and therfore muſt of neceſsitie both ſee & heare. Neither doth the infinitneſſe (as it ſeemeth to vs) of the particulars which happen in the world, hinder this vniuerſall knowledge of God: for they all are to him, not onely not infinit, but a fewe in compariſon of thoſe which he might & ſhould know if they were to be knowne, that is, if they did exiſt. It hath be ene admired in ſome great men, that they haue bin of ſuch capacitie & readineſſe of wit, as to be able at one inſtant to mind diuers matters, and to endite to two or three Secretaries as faſt as they could write: for why? as we, our outward ſences and inward faculties, are not many, but one particular, ſo they cannot well ſtretch themſelues at once to many diuers obiects, for then Pluribus intent us minor ad ſingula ſenſus.
                     
                     But it is not ſo with God, who although in trueth he be but one particular nature and eſſence, not many or diuers, yet hee is more large & vniuerſall, then the whole, yea then a thouſand worlds. And ſo if we conſider the proportion of his infinitneſſe to all things exiſting, wee ſhall finde, that it is farre eaſier for God to know and minde at once, all the

particulars which eyther haue beene, are, or are to bee, then for one of vs to thinke on any one particular thing or matter. As if (that wee may vſe the ſimilitude of the diuine eſſence which was brought before) wee ſhould ſuppoſe a man or an Angell to bee of ſo large a braine and vnderſtanding as is the whole element of the ayre, the which we know to be euery where, if it be not kept out by ſome more ſolide bodie, and that euery part of it were of ſufficient vertue to conceiue and knowe: we then ſhould not mauell, if at one inſtant hee did know and conſider of all the things in the world, and that without any confuſion of wit: how much more then ſhall we graune this vniuerſall knowledge to God, who is far more vniuerſall thē the ayre, he being not onely about things, but euen in the middeſt alſo of the moſt hard and ſolide ſtone, and not excluded by it, or by any bodie out of any place: yea hee being wholly euery where with euery man, yea with euery pi

In the ſecond place we are to conſider, that God knoweth himſelfe, and alſo the whole courſe of all things actually, that is, hee doeth not

attaine to the knowledge of it by doubtfull reaſoning, diſcourſe and conſequence of one thing frō another, but ſeeth it exiſting as certainly as if it were actually exiſting and preſent with him. Otherwiſe, if God did attaine to the knowledge of things, by way of vncertaine diſcourſe, it would follow, that his knowledge is ſometimes potentiall and imperfect, not hauing as yet attained to the thing it aymeth, but beeing onely in the way towards it: whereas we are to thinke, and hold for a moſt certaine trueth, that the whole courſe, order, beginning, progreſſe and end of the world, is and h

their mindes and inclinations of their willes, are both ſeen and alſo foreſeene of God, who doth accordingly direct and diſpoſe of them, as ſeemeth beſt vnto him: yet the freedome of the will remaineth (as indeed it cannot bee taken away vnleſſe the will it ſelfe, yea the creature it ſelfe, wherein the will reſteth, bee aboliſhed) not hauing any kinde of violence offered vnto it, but moouing it ſelfe of it ſelf, which way it pleaſeth: euen as we ſee a man ſitting on his horſe, doth not carrie the horſe, hither & thither, but is carried by the horſe, who goeth on by his own free wil, yet guided and ruled by the rider, and directed to that place which hee hath appointed. As wee plainely ſee in Adam, tranſgreſsing Gods commaundement giuen as touching the forbidden frute: the action was voluntarye and contingent in reſpect of Adam, who might haue abſtained if hee hadde would, for GOD did no way compell him or impell his will to eate the forbidden frute, but did both by promiſes and by threatnings diſſwade him from it. Yet there is no queſtion to bee made of it, but that GOD hadde as certainely foreſeene and foreappointed it, as if hee hadde reſolued to compell Adam
                        
by outward violence, or by inward compultion of his minde and will, to eate it. And ſo we are to thinke of all other the like caſes, that God doth plainly foreſee, that this or that without faile will be the iſſue and effect, though the cauſes be ambiguous, cōtingent, and as like in our eyes to bring forth the contrary effect: for he ſeeth eaſily, what motiues are in the minde to moue the will, and what force each of them hath to ſway it hither or thither.

                     INdeed, I haue often heard, that in men knowledge and wiſdome may be not onely diſtinguiſhed, but euen quite ſeparated the one from the other, as it is vſually ſaid of you ſchollers, that the greateſt Clarkes are not the wiſeſt men: yet I thoght that in God, knowledge and wiſedome were all one, and not to be diſtinguiſhed.

                     I haue heard as much my ſelfe, but I neuer thought him of whom I heard it, eythe more learned, or the more wiſe for ſaying ſo if he ſpake as he thought: and yet I know that they are diuerſe, and different things, as

are ſpeculation and practiſe. But (to come to the matter) in God they are not two diuerſe things, but one and the ſame thing diuerſely conſidered: for knowledge is a generall notion and ſpeculation, which when it commeth to bee put in practiſe in the making, ordering and diſpoſing of the creatures, is called wiſedome, to the which the counſels and decrees of God (whereof hereafter) are to be referred: and ſo knowledge is of ſimple, but wiſedome of compound things, ioyning togither in perfect order and agreement thoſe things, the natures wherof, were before fully knowne. Gent. You fall againe into the ſame error you did before, in limiting and reſtraining the knowledge of God to the creatures, which doth infinitly ſtretch it ſelfe abroad euen to God himſelfe, and ſo ſheweth it ſelſe to be infinit: ſo now alſo you tie his wiſdome, which in my minde, you may more rightly extend, ſo as it may belong alſo to God himſelfe. For howſoeuer as he exiſteth eternally himſelfe alone, he needeth not to be ordered by any wiſedome, neither can properly bee ſaid to be ordered by his owne wiſedome: for that order hath place, not in one ſimple nature exiſting in it ſelfe, both immutably and alſo immoueably, without any poſsibilitie of variance, diſcord, or confuſion, but rather in diuerſe things, whoſe natures being different,

are by wiſdome conioyned togither in good agreement: yet in that it pleaſeth God of his goodneſſe ſo to debaſe himſelf, as to haue any dealings with hi

                         creatures, in this reſpect euē God himſelfe and his actions are to bee ordered diſpoſed and guided: that as the creatures are made to agree among themſelues, ſo they may agree with God alſo their Creator, to their owne happineſſe and his glory.

                     You are too curious to be pleaſed, & too cunning to be taught: I ſpeake of things after the common and vſuall maner, according to the which, the obiect of Gods wiſdome, are his creatures, and not himſelfe: yet I confeſſe that this diſtinction which you bring, is true and not to be reiected. But as touching this wiſdome of God, ſhining euery where in the world, it is highly extolled in the ſcripture, as being moſt wonderfull and pleaſant to behold. And no doubt, but that it is a great happineſſe, that a man hath this grace giuen him of God, and his eyes opened to conſider and acknowledge it in any meaſure. For if the Queene of Saba were ſo rauiſhed with the report, and much more with the ſight of Salomons wiſedome, appearing in his fit & ſound anſweres, ſayings, ſentences, and prouerbes, containing in thē great depth of knowledge, and alſo in the practiſe of his life (whereby hee turned his ſpeculatiue knowledge into

practicall wiſdome) in the orderly conſtitution of his houſe and kingdome, and the right contriuing of al matters belonging therunto, that ſhee thought her trauell in comming to heare, ſee and behold it, well beſtowed, and the ſeruants of Salomon, moſt happie men, for that they making their daily attendance in his Court and preſence, had ſingular opportunitie of knowing and conſidering it: how much more happie a thing are we to eſteeme it to haue the wiſdome of God reuealed vnto vs: from the which, as from the ſunne ſhining in the firmament, this dimme candle of Salomons wiſedome receiued light. If Salomons houſe and kingdome were ſo well appointed and ſo wiſely ordered, that it wrought in the beholders admiration, yea aſtoniſhment and vnſpeakeable pleaſure, how much more excellent ſhall we think the orders of Gods houſe to be, whether we conſider the world in generall, which is the outward court, into the which, all both holy & prophane are admitted: but much more, if we conſider the Temple it ſelfe, to wit, his Church, wherin he is ſerued and worſhipped, and wherein hee doth reueale his glory in Chriſt & his Goſpell, after a ſpeciall maner: but moſt of all, if we conſider his glory in the holy of holieſt, to wit, in ye
                         heauens, & in the

heauen of heauēs, where the Apoſtle heard, and we may imagin, things not to be vttered. Firſt then, when as wee come into the outward Court of his Pallace, and conſider eyther the whole frame of the world, or the particular creatures therein contained: how euery thing is ſo curiouſly contriued in it ſelf, ſo correſpondent to the reſt, we ſhall ſee how truly wiſe Salomon doth acknowledge the incomparable wiſedome of God, in the creation of the world. Prou. 3. Iy. 20. The Lord through wiſedome, hath laid the foundations of the earth, and hath eſtabliſhed the heauēs throgh vnderstanding: by his knowledge the depthes are broken vp, and the Cloudes drop downe the deawe. If wee ſhould enter into particulars where ſhould wee beginne, or how ſhould wee euer make an ende? what profeſsion is there in the world, which would not thinke it great madneſſe, not to mention that about the which it is conuetſant, as a moſt pregnant witneſſe of the infinit wiſdome of God? how doth the Aſtronomer with endleſſeadmiratiō and aſtoniſhment, gaze vpon the ſtarres, and is neuer ſatiſfied with beholding their brightneſſe, counting their number, demonſtrating their greatneſſe, obſeruing their vertues and influence not to ſpeake of thoſe, as not worthy to be mentioned, who with the heathen

worſhip the Sunne, Moone and Starres, by aſcribing all operations and effects vnto thē: neither yet to roue abroade in theſe large fieldes, which yeeld as many arguments of Gods wiſedome, as the earth doth piles of graſſe, but to keep at home in our owne houſes: how infinitly, and yet how worthely do Phiſitians extoll the frame of mans body, how euery part is ſo wiſely and warely deuiſed to auoide all harmes and inconueniences, which might happen: neither do our bodies, alone that, but euen the loweſt flower, that groweth out of the earth, (the which if it can be but rudely counterfeited in wood, ſtone or colour, workmen think their cunning, and Princes their Pallaces highly aduanced) yea the ſillieſt worme that creepeth on the groūd and the leaſt flie that floteth in the ayre,, declare the ſame. For the which purpoſe the ſtudie of naturall Philoſophie is to bee accounted, as pleaſant ſo alſo very profitable, and worthy tobe followed by Chriſtians, as their gifts and callings do permit: for without queſtion, they that go downe into the depth of it, ſee the wonderfull wiſedome of God. But if we enter into the inner Court of Gods Pallace, to wit, into his Church, and there conſider his dealings with it from time to time, the ſmall beginnings,

the ſlowe progreſſe, the meane knowledge which it had in the firſt ages, as it were in the infancie of it, and how in theſe latter ages, it hath ſo mightely preuailed & ſo ſtretched it ſelfe ſo far abroad into the world, ſtill fleeting and moouing as doth the Sunne in the outward Court) from the Eaſterne to the Weſterne countries and kingdomes: But if we ſtep a little further into it, and there conſiſider the deepe miſteries of knowledge, and wiſedome, contained in the bowels of the ſcripture, the vnſearchable obſcuritie of aenigmaticall Oracles mocking the ſharpneſſe of all humane wit, the agreement of ceremonies with the body, of the types, with the things ſignified, of puniſhments with ſinnes: but eſpecially, if wee conſider in the three folde ſtate of man himſelfe, firſt the ſtately building of this Pallace, begun in Adam, then the miſerable ruine of it in his fall and laſtly, the glorious repairing of it'm Chriſt the ſecond Adam

and as it is Col. 1. 3. that in Chriſt and in the matter and miſtery of the Goſpell, the very treaſures of Gods wiſedome are both hid and reuealed. Laſtly, if we ſhould draw a litle nearer, and with confidence enter into the glorious preſence of God in heauen, where there are no cloudes or myſtes, to keepe from vs the cleare ſunſhine of his wiſedome, all his counſels, decrees, deuiſes and dealings, beeing vnfolded, and fully accompliſhed, we ſhould thē ſay as the Queene of Saba ſaid of Salomons wiſedome, and the vnſpeakable pleaſure conceiued by the beholding it, that the report which goeth on earth and in the church of the wiſedome of God, yea the conceit which we haue in our mindes of it, how great ſoeuer it be, is as nothing to the thing it ſelfe. But I wil not be ſo preſumptuous, as to take in hand this argument, or to attempt to ſet forth the wiſedome of God, as it ſhineth in the world, and in the Church, and much more fully, (although as yet not ſo plainly to vs) in heauen: It were an argument fitter for the tongues or pennes of Angels then of men, and whereof we may ſay, that if all ſhould bee written, that might bee brought to that purpoſe, the whole world would ſcarce ſuffice to hold the bookes which would be written.

                        ther voide of the ſubſtance of trueth. I did verely thinke, that the vnderſtanding, knowledge and wiſedome, whereof you haue ſpoken, had beene truly & really in god, and not only ſhadowes of his vnknowne nature. I may well vſe the ſimilitude of the Prophet, and compare my ſelfe to a man, who beeing hungrie and thirſtie, dreameth that he eateth and drinketh according to his owne appetite, but awaking on a ſuddaine, hee findeth himſelfe drie and emptie: ſo I did all this while imagine that you did feed, and in trueth euen fill my hungrie and thirſtie ſoule with the knowledge of God, the which I do farre more earneſtly and greedely deſire thē euer I did meat or drinke, and behold, on a ſuddaine you awaken mee out of this pleaſant dreame, and tell me that all is nothing but mere imaginations.

                     You take mee at the worſt, and farre woorſe then you ſhould do: I haue not fedde you with winde or vaine dreames, as you inferre of my words, but the trueth is this. The nature of God is ſo vnſearchable, and ſo faare

aboue the reache of any created wit, that when we haue come as neare it as we can, and haue to our thinking, gotten ſome hold of it, yet the very remembrance of ourowne weakneſſe in compariſon of the infinitneſſe of it makes to vs to diſtruſt and ſuſpect our ſelues as beeing deceiued with a falſe conceit of that which cannot poſsibly bee truly conceiued & comprehended: here of it commeth, that although we be verily perſwaded that underſtanding, knowledge & wiſdome are in God, not onely truly and really, but alſo moſt properly as in the naturall ſubiect or rather ſubſtantially without any ſubiect, but being to themſelues an vpholding ſubiect, yet we doubting the worſt, and thinking that the diuine nature, is ſomething more, and more excellent then an infinit vnderſtanding, although in truth there cannot bee any nature more excellent then an vnderſtanding, or a reſonable nature, nor any thing more then that which is infinit: and alſo thinking that for ſo much as theſe things to wit, vnderſtanding, knowledge and wiſedome haue place in the nature of man, whom we ſee and feele to be a moſt weake and ſilly creature, that therefore they cannot be truly in the nature of God, hereof it commeth, that wee rather call them the attributes or reſemblances

of his nature, then his very eſſence or nature it ſelfe, the which in trueth they are.

                     That is an other matter, but then we muſt not foſter in our ſelues this vaine feare and doubting to affirmi him to bee that which we learne and know out of his word, that he is indeed, but rather boldly without any wauering or doubting, affirme him to be that he is, knowing moſt certainly that wee are not deceiued: and if we be deceiued, that then God himſelfe hath deceiued vs, with whom it is better to erre, then to holde the trueth in our owne conceits. But I cannot but laugh to my ſelfe, when I thinke of one thing that you ſaid, that wee doubted, leaſt that vnderſtanding, knowledge and wiſedome, were not truly in God, becauſe they are truly in the nature of man, whereas you ſhould haue inferred the cleane contrarie: to wit, that wee know aſſuredly, that God is an vnderſtanding or reaſonable nature, becauſe man who is reaſonable, is the image of ſimilitude of God, yea, and made for this end, to ſhew & repreſent to vs the nature of god: but how I pray you, can a reaſonable nature bee an image or ſimilitude of that which is not reaſonable? Now proceed I pray you, and ſhewe me, how and what you make will to be in God?

                     Will is very fitly and truly, yea eſſentially giuen to God: for as in the ſoule of man, will is not an accidentall qualitie, which may be ſpared without the diminiſhing or aboliſhing of the ſubiect, as may knowledge or wiſedome, but an eſſentiall facultie iſſuing properly and immediately out of the vnderſtanding, and cleaning inſeparably vnto it (for that it is impoſsible that the conceits receiued into the mind, ſhould reſt ydly there, and not tebound backe againe into action, euen as the beames of the ſunne lighting vppon a ſolide bodie, cannot but reflect, and ſo make heate): ſo we are to thinke, that the eſſentiall vnderſtanding of God doth naturally, neceſſarely and eternally, bring foorth the eſſentiall will of God, the which may bee defined, the eſſential act of his vnderſtanding, the fountaine and beginning of all his actions which are ſimply good.

                     Euen as it is in all other things which haue will, the which is of this nature, that in what ſubiect ſoeuer it be, it will there dominere,

and haue the ſole and ſupreme authoritie of doing all things: and therefore may truly be called Primus motor, the firſt mouer and beginning of all actions, for euery thing that hath wil, doth that onely (or at the leaſt tendeth to the doing of it, wich it willeth. As for the vnderſtanding, althogh it be in order & nature before yt
                         will, yet it is not ſaid to be the beginning of actiō, becauſe it onely moueth, perſwadeth, and directeth, but doth not inforce or compell: for as wee vſually ſay, counſel is no commaund: whereof it commeth, that although in God there be no ſuch diſagreement, yet in ye
                         creatures it doth of
                           •
                        ē come to paſſe. that the will reiecteth the counſell and direction which the minde giueth, and worketh without or againſt reaſon, according to the owne inclination. But the will is followed and obeyed by the actions in all things poſsible, euen as the commaundements of a ſoueraigne Monarche within the compaſſe of his kingdome, are put in execution by loyal ſubiects, without any reſiſtance. And indeed will may very fitly be it compared to an abſolute & mightie Monarche, for that it cannot either be controled, cōmanded, or compelled by any ſuperior power without it ſelfe, or yet reſiſted by any inferiour within his owne dominions: it being impoſſible

euen to God himſelf, to inforce or conſtraine the will of the leaſt of his creatures. He may indeed aboliſh & deſtroy al the wils and all the creatures in the world, or enforce thē by outward violence to whatſoeuer pleaſeth him: yea he may (as hee doth in regeneration) by changing & inlightning ye
                         minde, make that the will ſhall incline it ſelfe to that which it did before abhor: yet he cānot compel any thing to be willing, it being of it ſelfe vnwilling. Wherof it cōmeth, that this ſoueraigne monarche harh place in thoſe creaturs only, which are intire & abſolute in thēſelues, not depending vpō any other without it ſelf-whatſoeuer, for abilitie of motion & action. And therfore trees, which haue not in themſelues ſufficient power of natural heat, wherby to mooue thēſelues at their own pleaſure, but do depēd vpō the ſun, by whoſe heat they are helped, cānot be ſaid to haue will. But as for thoſe things which do perfectly liue and mooue, as do all things which haue life and ſoule, for they do as freely mooue or reſt, and performe any naturall action, as any man or gell.
                  
                  
                     Gent.
                     I like wel, that youmake the wil of god the firſt beginning of al his actios: but to make this cōmon vnto the creaturs, as if they wer ſo abſolute, that they did not, nor neded to depēd on god, me thinks it is harſh,

and ſoundeth ſomewhat to the diſgrace of God, to whom (me thinkes) you ſhould not deny this royall prerogatiue, that his will ſhould bee the firſt moouer and beginning, not onely of his owne actions, but alſo of all the actions of all the creatures, rather then to make euery liuing creature, as it were a priuiledged place, exempted frō his iurisdiction.
                  
                  
                     Sch.
                     Wee are rather to account it to bee a great praiſe and glorie to God, that as hee himſelfe is moſt perfect, ſo he is able to make other things alſo, not onely imperfect (as ſome of the creatures, to wit, thoſe which wāt ſence, may bee called, although they alſo be perfect in their kindes) but alſo perfect and abſolute in themſelues, able to mooue themſelues (within the compaſſe of their naturall power) when and as it pleaſeth themſelues, without any outward helpe whatſoeuer. Let vs ſuppoſe (for wee may reade of ſuch a matter) that ſome cunning Mathematican made a doue of wood, or ſome ſuch matter, which could flie out, and returne to him home againe: ſhould hee thinke it a diſgrace vnto him, that this doue needed not his helpe, or that hee ſhould carrie it abroad, when as it could flie of it ſelfe: and not rather thinke it a matter of incomparable praiſe, that hee could make ſuch an abſolute and admirable

peece of worke? yes ſurely, for the perfection and abſoluteneſſe of the worke, doth not detract, but addeth to the praiſe of the workman: as no doubt but that it is a great glorie to God, that all the creatures in the world mooue, preſerue, and increaſe themſelues, by the ſole means of that vertue & ſtrength which hee put into them in the beginning, without any other ſupply or ſtrēgth, althogh without queſtion, they do many waies both need & feele his helping hand. Yet hath not the creature hence any matter of boaſting againſt god, for that all that abſoluteneſſe and perfection, which it hath, came not of it ſelf, but from God: who as hee gaue it, ſo hee is able to take it way, and as hee made all the creatures of nothing, ſo alſo to conſume them all to nothing, if it were his will. Beſides, if wee did make the will of God the beginning and fountaine, not onely of his own actions, but alſo of the actions of the creatures, wee ſhould admit many inconueniences and abſurdities: for then all the enormities, monſtrous confuſions & ſinnes, which are in the world, ſhould bee aſcribed and referred to God, as to the fountain from the which they ſprang. Yea, wee ſhould fall into their hereſie, or rather extreame madneſſe, who imagine the whole world, and all the creatures

cōtained in it, to be the bodie of god, & god to be the ſoule of euery liuing thing, thē the which nothing can be imagined more groſſe and impious. So then in this compariſon of the will of God with the will of the creature, we ſee in the firſt place, that as God, ſo alſo the perfect, that is, all liuing and moouing creatures, haue their proper wils, not onely diſtinct and diuers from the will of God, but alſo free and abſolute in themſelues, and exempted from being conſtrained or enforced by the authoritie or power of God, yea it may be ſaid truly, if it can bee ſo 
                           •
                        aken and vnderſtood, that the will of the creature is no leſſe free in the own kinde, then is the wil of God, for nothing can bee added to that which is in the higheſt degree. Whereof it commeth, that this freedome of will is alike in all things, in the brute beaſt as in the reaſonable man, in men as in angels, in the creature as in the creator, yea (ſi paruis componero magna liceret) in the leaſt flie or weakeſt worme, as in the mightie God of heauen and earth. Not that any creature hath ſo effectuall a will as God hath for there is no compariſon between the power of God, and of all the creatures in the world ioyned togither in one: as a poore mā is not of ſo great abilitie as is a great Lord, yet his freedome

may bee as great, The creature can doo nothing, but it may will any thing againſt the will of god: the mightieſt creature is not free to doo what it liſt yet the weakeſt is free to do whatit liſt, as can be imagined, euen as the priſoner that lieth bound in chaines in the corner of a ſtraight priſon, is as free in will, as the king that ſitteth on his throne. Freedome therefore is ſo inſeparable and eſſentiall a propertie of the will, that it cannot poſsibly by any meanes or power whatſoſoeuer, be taken away eyther from the brutiſh, the reaſonable, or the diuine will. Will may be taken from the creature, & the creature out of the nature of things; yet cannot freedome be taken frō the will, for it wil follow it, either exiſting or at the leaſt deſiſting with it. Laſtly herein agree the wils of ye
                         creature with the wil of God, rhat all of thē, whither created or vncreated, tend & incline to good, not all to that which is in trueth good, yet al to y•
                         which is in appearance good. For as it is the nature of euery thing to preſerue, & to delight it ſelfe, ſo for that purpoſe it eſcheweth whatſoeuer ſeemeth euil, and inclineth it ſelf towards y•
                         wich it iudgeth good & pleaſant. And as euery nature is diuers from all other, ſo euery one hath a particular good to the attaining wherof itmoueth it ſelf, and alſo the ſubiect which it hath in ſubiection,

and in the fruition whereof, it reſteth and pleaſeth it ſelfe, as in happineſſe & the chiefe good. Thus the nature of God hath a proper kinde of good belonging to it, the which is ſimply and chiefly good: to wit, his owne glorie, wherevnto the will of God in all the actions of God doth ayme and incline: for in it, riſing out of it ſelfe before the creation, & ſince gotten, or rather continued by meanes of the creatures, it doth reſt and pleaſe it ſelfe for euer.
                  
               
               
                  
                     Sect. 5.
                  THus farre the will of God agreeth with the will of the creature: now followeth the difference, the which cannot but be great. Firſt they differ in that reſpect, which hath alreadie beene named, to wit, that the will of God is alwaies effectuall and actuall, alwaies bringing it ſelfe into act without faile, or any difficultie, and therefore is neuer in vaine, whereas the creature doth often incline and mooue it ſelfe inwardly towarde ſome obiect, but cannot goe forward in accompliſhing and bringing foorth into act that inward motion: being hindred either by the impotencie of the ſubiect wherein it is, or by ſome greater power, but nothing can

reſiſt the will of God, or make his purpoſe fruſtate. This is the firſt difference, and yet to ſpeake properly, and to ſay the truth, this is not a difference of the wils, but of the perſons and their power: For the wil being hindered from putting it ſelf into executiō, may be as ſtrong, yea vſually is more ſtrong then when it hath outward power ioyned vnto it. Secondly, the will of God is immutable and the ſame for euer, that which he willeth once, hee willeth alwaies, but the will of the creature is more variable then is the winde neuer conſtant, but continually altering it ſelf from one obiect to another, yea often to that which is cleane contrary to the other: & that not onely in particular obiects, but euen in regard of the general kinds of good, 
                        •
                     eiecting the true good for a falſe appearance, & with all true happineſſe, for a vaine and tranſitorie ſhadow of pleaſure. Neyther is it any maruell, that the will of the creature is ſo variable, when as it is ſo eaſily deceiued, and ledde out of the way by error and ignorance, or elſe ouerruled by headſtrong affections, frō both which the nature of God being free, admitteth no manner of alteration in will. The reaſons which may ſeeme to inferre alteration of will in God, are drawne out of thoſe places of ſcripture in the which it is ſaid, that

God hath not performed, that which hee hath ſpoken and purpoſed: as when he being mooued either with the ſinnes and vnthankfulneſſe of the wicked, or by the prayers and repentance of the godly, doth confeſſe himſelfe to repent of that good which hee hath done to the one, or of thoſe afflictions which he had threatned to the other. But the trueth is, that God neuer repenteth himſelfe eyther of the one or of the other but taketh to himſelfe the perſon and manner of men, who not foreſeeing what will follow, do often repent themſelues, and are ſorrie both for benefites beſtowed on vnthankfull & vnworthie perſons, and alſo for too great ſeueritie and raſh anger vpon thoſe whom they loue.
                  
                     Gent.
                     You haue made one obiection againſt the immutabilitie of the will of God, & haue alſo fully ſatiſfied it: I pray you do as much to one that I will make.
                  
                  
                     Sch.
                     I know not whither I can or no, but I will do my indeuour.
                  
                  
                     Gent.
                     You need not feare it, for I knowe you haue often both mooued and aunſwered it ere now: it is this. If the will of god cannot be altered in any thing that he hath determined, and that he hath determined all things whatſoeuer, what need wee vſe any meanes for the attaining of any good, or what will it

auaile to labor to eſchew euill, when the determinate will and purpoſe of God, cannot be by prayer, or by any other meanes auoyded, but muſt of neceſsitie ſtand and take place.
                  
                  
                     Sch.
                     The anſwere is as you ſay, eaſie & ordinarie, for God willeth and worketh (ordinarily) nothing but by the ordinarie means effectuall for that purpoſe, the which he hath commanded vs to vſe: and therefore we are to thinke & hope that our endeuours are the meanes which hee hath appoynted for our good. If our endeuors take not effect, we are to acknowledge thoſe wants & harmes to be ſent from God, the which (otherwiſe) we could not haue denied to haue happened through our owne default: and therefore we are to be carefull in vſing all good means effectuall for any good purpoſe, and eſpecially of prayer, which you bring for an inſtaunce: for to imagine that God hath ſo tied himſelfe to a ſtoicall fate and neceſſarie courſe of things that hee can not, though hee would, grant our deſires, is moſt fond & fooliſh, cō
                        trary to the whole courſe of ſcripture, and in truth, the vtter ſubuerſion of all godlineſſe. You might in like maner obiect, that it muſt needs be graunted, that God doth ſometimes change his wil, ſeeing that he willeth contrary things, wich cānot come to paſſe: for exāple,

                        God would haue all men to be ſaued, and come to the knowledge of his trueth. This is true, for it is the word, yea the very words of god, 1. Tim. 3. 4. Againe, it is his wil that ſom ſhould periſh, for it is certaine that ſome do periſh, and that neyther without nor againſt the will of God, but by his will & purpoſe, as the ſcripture doth plainly teach vs euery where. Likewiſe it was the will of God, that Adam ſhould not eyther taſte or touch the forbidden fruite, for hee forebad him: and yet wee cannot doubt, but that God had foreappoynted, that Adam ſhould fall by eating the forbidden fruit, and ſo in infinit other inſtances: for anſwere of all which, wee are to diſtinguiſh the commaundements of God giuen to vs from his will, which hee keepeth, to himſelfe: he commaunds things impoſsible, to ſhew vs what we ought to doo and to endeuor, as is the fulfilling of the lawe, and the conuerting of all men, as farre as we can, to the obedience of the Goſpell: both which are good, and to be endeuored by vs, and therefore commanded by him, but both of them impoſsible, and therefore not to be thought to be willed by him. Againe, God cōmandeth ſometimes to this end, to giue occaſion of ſin, for the which end he forebad Adam to eate of the fruite of the tree of good and euill, and ſo

the Apoſtle ſaith, that the law was giuen to make ſin abound: yea God ſometimes commādeth that he wold not haue done, to make triall of our faith, as he commanded Abraham to ſacrifice his ſonne Iſaac. But theſe commandements are not to be accounted the wil of God: yea if hee command any thing contrary to his written word, this argueth no change or contrarietie in his will, but onely, that God is not nor will bee bound to any law. Laſtly, the wil of God differeth from the will of the creature, in that it onely inclineth it ſelf naturally and neceſſarely to that onely that is good: whereas the willes of the creatures although they do incline to good only as we ſee in the elect angels, yet it is not of nature & neceſsitie, but of grace, & ſo of contingencie. For naturally their wil is free as wel to euill as to good, neyther is it poſsible, that the wil of any creature ſhould be otherwiſe, howſoeuer by grace & the aſsiſtance of God it continue, in affecting only that which is good. But the wil of God doth neceſſarely mooue to good onely, becauſe whatſoeuer God willeth, it is therfore good, becauſe he willeth it, his wil being the ſquare & rule of good, ſo that whatſoeuer agreeth to it, that is good as contrariwiſe, if it diſſent from it, it is to be accounted euill. Hence it cōmeth that

God when he willeth and commandeth any thing contrary to the morall law, as when hee did bid Abraham kill his ſonne, the Prophet Hoſe to company with a harlot, and the Hebrewes to ſpoyle the Egyptians, or in that he decreeth that their ſhall be ſin in the world, yet in ſo doing, he willeth nothing but that which is good, for by willing it, he maketh it good. Yet in proper ſpeech, theſe actions of men, although commaunded by God, are not to be accounted the proper obiect of the will of God, the which we muſt needs thinke to haue a larger ſcope and obiect, yea a more excellent obiect then are a fewe particular actions of mē. For the proper obiect of gods will, is that wherevnto it doth totally, eternally, and naturally incline and tend as wee knowe the obiect of mans will, to bee apparant good and pleaſure, this beeing the ſcope wherat our nature doth wholly ayme, to preſerue it ſelfe in a good and pleaſant eſtate. In like manner the good whereat Gods will doth wholly ayme, is his owne glorie, the maintaining, aduancing and inlarging of it is that which he doth deſire aboue all things, to this end and purpoſe are all his counſelles, creatures and actions to be referred, & in this being obtained, as in his chiefe good, pleaſure & happineſſe he doth delight and reſt contented.

ariſing of the diuerſitie of particular obiects, making an impreſſion into the wil according to their ſeuerall natures, and ſtirring it vp to deſire.

                     Gent.
                     I pray you thinke it not yrke ſome to make a particular declaration of them: for I do not ſee, how theſe things & eſpecially the affections that you ſpeake of, will eyther bee truly found in God, or can fitly be attributed to him.

                     If you meane by affections, ſudden and vehement perturbations, ſuch as we ſee vſually in men riſing and ceaſing as occaſions and obiects are offered, then there are no affections in God, for thers is nothing in him at any time, that is not alwaies in him, and that hath not bene in him from all eternitie. But if (as we may) we meane by affections, conſtant continuall yea eternall acts, motions, and inclinations (for euen theſe two latter termes (although improper) muſt for wāt of better be vſed) of his will, not ſtirred vp on a ſudden like a tempeſt, by this or that particular obiect, but ſetled & permament, ariſing of the diuerſe natures of things and agreeable thereunto, in this ſenſe wee may truly' ſay, that there are affections in GOD, for hee doth truly loue and embrace good and likewiſe hate and abhorre whatſoeuer is euill.
                  
                  
                     Gent.
                     You make a ſtrange diſtinction of

affections, ſome ſudden and momentanie, others permanent and eternall: thus you make them no affections but habituall diſpoſitions, and morall vertues.
                  
                  
                     Sch.
                     You neede not meruell ſo much at this diſtinction, for it hath place euen in humane affections, as wee know that hatred is an habituall and inueterate anger, and loue alſo may bee ſetled and fixed for euer: but it muſt of neceſsitie be admitted in GOD, for that his will being eternall and immutable, ſendeth foorth affections of the ſame nature, as the little twigges and braunches of a Tree are of the ſame nature with the great boughes and bodie of it, and the ſtreames with the fountaine from whence they flowe: yea, in truth they are ſo ſetled and conſtant in God, that wee cannot diſtinguiſh them from his will, moouing it ſelfe without any alteration, too or fro the obiect, as the nature of it is good or euill.
                     In men they are like to the flames of fire, blowne vp by the impreſsion of the obiects, as by a great blaſt of winde, and make ſuch ſtraunge alterations in them that you would ſcarce ſay, they were the ſame men which they ſeemed before. But no obiect of what nature or force ſo euer it bee

can make the leaſt alteration or impreſsion into the will of GOD, whoſe nature is immutable, yea impaſsible. For hee is not materiall as are the creatures, yea euen the Angels themſelues who muſt needs be granted to conſiſt of, and in ſome matter, which may ſuffer and bee altered, whereof it commeth that not onely men, but euen the ſpirituall Angels, are ſubiect to affection, paſsion and perturbation: but God is a pure and mere forme, and therefore altogither actuall, hee is immateriall, and therefore impaſsible.

                     Belike you make all affections to be acts, motions and inclinations of the will, but with this difference, that in God they are eternall, generall, conſtant and quiet (and indeed, acts of the will, but neither motions nor inclinations) but in man, momentanie, variable, euident, raging & particular, ſtirred vp not by the generall conſideration of the diuerſe natures of things as they are in God, (whoſe affections in that reſpect muſt needs be conſtant, becauſe the generall natures and notions of things, are eternall, and immutable) but with this or that particular obiect, and therefore variable and vncertaine.

                     VVEll, I pray you ſhew mee the particular poynts of doctrine in the loue of God: for as I remember, you put that firſt of the affections which you ſay are attributed to God.
                  
                  
                     Sch.
                     Loue is moſt fitly and truly attributed to God, who for that he excelleth in this affection, is defined by it as if it were his very eſſential form, for ſo we read, 1. Iohn. 4. 16. God is loue.
                     
                     
                        
But that wee may knowe the particulars of this loue of God, it is needfull that wee firſt ſearch out, and conſider the nature of loue in generall, the which may thus after a ſort bee deſcribed. Loue is an inclination of the will to a pleaſan
                           •
                         obiect for the fruition of the pleaſure of it: the which breedeth a deſire of doing good vnto it, if it be capable of it.
                     This deſcription is to be explained by alleadging the ſeuerall obiects of loue, or of thoſe things which men do vſually loue, in all which it will appeare that the cauſe why they are loued and ſought vnto, is ſome ſweetneſſe or pleaſure, which may be ſucked out of them, & that nothing is loued, which doth not bring with it ſome delight and pleaſure: thus Iohn reaſoneth, 1. Ioh. 4. 20. How can he that loueth not his brother whom he hath ſeene, that is, with whom hee hath conuerſed, and ſo might haue taken delight & pleaſure by him, loue God whom hee hath not ſeen? and wee read Gen. 25. 28. that Iſaac loued Eſau becauſe his veniſon taſted ſweete in his mouth, and Leah ſaith, Gen. 29 32. Now my huſband will loue mee, hauing borne him a ſon. By theſe and infinite other examples it appeareth, that all men incline to that wherein they finde and feele ſome pleaſure and ſweetneſſe,

and this inclination is called the loue of that thing. Yet this is not all in loue, and therfore we muſt adde the ſecond part of the deſcriptiō, which ſaith, that the pleaſure in true loue procureth a deſire in him that loueth, and enioyeth the pleaſure, to return pleaſure, delight and any good whatſoeuer can bee done vnto it, to the thing loued. For without this mutual relation of pleaſure, it is not to be called loue but rather luſt: as the inclination which men haue to thoſe meates, drinks, and ſuch other things, the which they loue, is not true loue but rather luſt, and thoſe things are properly ſaid to be loued, to the which wee may returne that pleaſure and delight, which wee receiued from and by them, and procure their good, as well as they procured our pleaſure. For example, the inclination which a man hath to an harlot, and to the pleaſure that may bee hadde by her, is not true loue, but onely luſt, becauſe heerein a man hath reſpect onely to himſelfe, and to his owne pleaſure, not caring what become of her, when his luſt is ſatisfied. But the affection which a man beareth to his wife, is of an other kinde, and is true loue, becauſe he doth not reſt in that pleaſure which hee enioyeth by her meanes, bu
                           •
                         addeth thereunto

an earneſt deſire and indeuour, by all meanes poſsible to procure her good, beeing farre more deſirous to pleaſe and profit her, then to pleaſe himſelfe by her: otherwiſe it is not true loue, but ſelfe loue, for true loue hath a hand to giue, as ready yea more ready then one for to take.
                     And therefore meates and drinkes, and ſuch other pleaſant things, although they doo greatly delight vs, yet they cannot bee ſaid to bee loued, becauſe they periſh with the vſe, and though they did 
                           •
                        emaine, they are not capable of any pleaſure or good to bee done in way of requitall, which is the cheefe part of loue. But men are truly ſaid to loue theyr friends, wiues and children becauſe as they doo many wayes receiue pleaſure, comfort, ioy, delight and profit by them, ſo theyr whole deſire is, to returne all that good backe againe into theyr boſomes with double intereſt.
                  
                  
                     Gent.
                     You ſay that it is not true loue, but luſt to take pleaſure in any thing, without returning, and as it were repaying the ſaid pleaſure to him from whom it was taken, and, as it were, borrowed.
                     Indeed this is good honeſt dealing, and

to be commended, but if I be not deceiued, I can ſhew you a more true and excellent loue, then this which you haue propounded, to wit that which Chriſt preferreth farre before this your loue, the which may be called a kind of traffiquing and exchanging of one good turne, or benefit for an other. But the loue which he commendeth vnto vs, is not procured, and as it were bought or hired by precedent pleaſure, but commeth from a mere deſire of dooing good vnto them which haue not onely not deſerued it at our hands, by louing vs, but contrarely, haue by hating and harming vs, prouoked vs to requite and repay them with the like hard meaſure: Math. 6. 43. You haue heard that it hath bene ſaid, loue thy neighbour, and hate thine enemie: but I ſay vnto you loue your enemies: for if you loue your friends onely, what great matter is that? do not the Publicans ſo? And as this loue is farre more excellent then yours, ſo it doth farre better agree to your purpoſe and ſerue for the explication of the loue of God: for if wee ſhould make the ground of his loue towards vs to bee the fruition of ſome pleaſure in vs, or by our meanes, we ſhould make a faire peece of work of it, or rather marre all the ground of our ſaluation, which relyeth it ſelfe vpon the mere loue of God, not procured by any deſert, or

any occaſion whatſoeuer on our owne behalfe.
                  
                  
                     Sch.
                     If you thinke that our Sauiour Chriſt meaneth, that wee ſhould beare as great loue to ſtrāgers & to our enemies, as to our friends, you are farre deceiued: for ſo he ſhould deſtroy nature it ſelfe, which hath with her owne fingerwritten in our hearts this deſcription of loue, which I haue brought: to wit, that our loue ſhuld be greater towards them, at whoſe hands we haue receiued pleaſure and comfort, then to them who are ſtrangers or enemies vnto vs. But his meaning is, that to our enemies wee ſhould not bee full of anger and reuenge, but patient, gentle, yea louing and helpful, labouring by good to ouercome their ill: and that by doing good to ſtraungers, from whom, or from any in their name, we are neuer like to receiue any retribution, we ſhould ſhewe the faith and loue which we beare vnto God, in obedience of whoſe commaundement we do that, which of it ſelfe is hurtfull vnto vs. But that a man ſhould loue a malitious enemie as earneſtly as a louing and faithfull friend, a ſtrange and vnknowne woman as well as his owne wife, other mens children as well as his owne, it is not onely not commendable, but euen monſtrous, and contrary both to the light of nature, & to the

law of God. For ſo we ſhould be vniuſt and iniurious to our owne friends, to whom our loue and the duties of it do belong, in beſtowing it vpon others, and in ſuffering them to to reape the croppe where they did not ſowe any ſeed. yea then Chriſtians ſhould endeuour to procure to themſelues, the good will of their brethren, not by duties of loue, but by iniuries, then the which what can bee ſaid or ſuppoſed more abſurd. Now as touching the loue of God towards vs, the which you affirme to come of the free motion of his will, not proucked, cauſed, or occaſioned by any good or pleaſure, which he getteth by vs, I confeſſe that GOD electeth to ſaluation without any motiue of goodneſſe foreſeene in vs, euen of hi
                           •
                         mere will and good pleaſure: and that it were mere madneſſe to imagine, that there is any thing in vs or in any creature, by the which we might eyther pleaſure or profit God: yet I anſwere you, firſt that we are to diſtinguiſh betwixt the election, and the loue of God, for God chuſeth and predeſtinanateth to loue of his owne mere will, but hee loueth not, but for ſome cauſe. For as his loue is in the generall notion inclined to good, & not to euill, ſo he loueth nothing but that which is good, yea and hee loueth it becauſe

it is good, and for the goodneſſe ſake. If you ſay what is our goodneſſe to God, that he ſhould loue vs for it, what doth it profit or pleaſure him: indeed he ſtandeth in no need of it: yet he taketh pleaſure in it, the Lord delighteth in the righteouſneſſe of his Saints, their ſins are as eyeſores, & vnpleaſant ſights vnto him. For why God delighteth in himſelfe, and euery thing in that which is like it ſelfe: he taketh pleaſure to behold his own Image in vs euen as the greateſt ioy & pleaſure that a mā can haue in any worldly thing, is to behold his owne fauour and faſhions, his owne countenance and conditions, in his ſon. And therefore the more that a man in holineſſe reſembleth god, the more he is beloued of him, as being ſo much, liker to him, as it is ſaid of Dauid, that he was a man according to the heart of God.
                  
                  
                     Gent.
                     This doctrine ſoundeth very harſh to me, and ſo I think it wold do to others, if they ſhould heare it, as that which giueth a great blowe to Gods free election: I am ſure you haue read, that Chriſt loued vs being his enemies. Rom. 5. and that you do not doubt, but that God loued the Apoſtle Paule, euen in his infidelitie, and when he in great furie did perſecute the Church.
                  
                  
                     Sch.
                     It may bee, that it would ſeeme

ſtrange to them that haue not conſidered of it: but the doctrine is, as I thinke, good and ſound, that God neither hateth any but for ſin, neither loueth any but as they are holy. Yet our foreſeen holines is not the cauſe why God doth elect vs to ſaluation: for firſt he electeth vs to loue & to life, & then afterward by ſanctifying vs, he maketh vs capable of his loue and of eternal life. The proper obiect of Gods loue, is the holineſſe of the reaſonable creature, vnto the which, as being agreeable to his owne nature, God doth encline himſelf by dooing good vnto it, as hee receiueth a kind of contentation in it, and from it. As for the eſtate of the elect before they bee called and ſanctified, we know that whom God loueth once, he loueth alwaies: and Paul euen in the heate of his furie againſt Chriſt, was beloued of God, as one whom hee had choſen and predeſtinate to beare at the appointed time his owne Image of holineſſe, and ſo the foreſight of holineſſe in him may be ſaid to be the the cauſe of Gods loue, though not of his election, For God may chuſe to loue whom he liſt, but hee cannot loue, but according to his owne nature, neither any thing, but that which is in ſome ſort agreeable to his nature: for he cannot loue or like, but muſt of neceſsitie hate and abhorre euill, as well in

concreto, as in abſtracto: in parricular ſubiects, as well as in generall notions: that ſo hee may be alwaies like himſelfe.

                     Gent.
                     I Will not contend with you about it at this time, becauſe I will not hinder you from other matters: now that you haue laid the foundation of the deſcription of Gods loue, I pray you go on with the reſt of the building.
                  
                  
                     Sch.
                     We will: and firſt, we may out of that, that hath bene ſaid to this purpoſe, define the loue of God to be, the motion, or rather the act of his will, enclining it ſelfe by dooing good, to good preuailing in the reaſonable creature. In this diſcription wee are to obſerue theſe three things: firſt, that the loue of God belongeth onely to the reaſonable creature: ſecondly, that the motiue or inducement ſtirring vp in God this loue, is goodneſſe preuailing in the creature: and laſtly, that the manner, or rather a proper and neceſſary effect of this loue or inclination of God to the creature, is by dooing good vnto it.
                     The firſt point being plain inough of it ſelfe, needeth no further explanation: for although all the creatures in theyr ſeuerall

kindes and degrees, haue in them a ſpeciall goodneſſe, in reſpect whereof, God may bee ſaid to loue, and fauour them, as we read. Gen. 1. 31. that God hauing finiſhed all the creatures, looked vpon them: and ſeeing them all to be good, bleſſed them: and ſtill to extend his gracious prouidence ouer them al, preſeruing and vpholding them, not onely by the ordinarie force of their natures, but euen by extraordinary meanes vnknowne to vs, as hee is ſaid to feed the young rau
                           •
                        ns, when they call vpon him (although this may be aſcribed to naturall meanes) yet in proper ſpeech hee is ſaid to loue the reaſonable creatures onely, whom hee hath picked out of the whole bunch, whereon to ſet his heart, wherein to delight and take pleaſure.
                     This choiſe of his loue, it hath pleaſed God to make for two cauſes: firſt in reſpect of the excellent goodneſſe, as it were the ſurpaſſing bewtie of the reaſonable creature, the which beeing framed according to the likeneſſe of God, maketh a kinde of ſympathie and naturall agreement betwixt God and it: whereof it commeth, that God taketh exceeding delight and pleaſure in the ſoule of mā, the faculties of it being orderly diſpoſed and endued with that bewtie of holineſſe, which God created in it, and therefore may

iuſtly require of it) as in a moſt pleaſant garden and paradiſe, ſhining with all varietie of the moſt faire flowers and colours. The other reſpect, which appropriateth the loue of God to the reaſonable creature, is, for that as it onely hath in it matter of exceeding pleaſure and delight to God, ſo it onely is capable of the rebound, recourſe, and reciprocation of the ſaid pleaſure from God, in the which as hath beene ſaid the chiefe part of loue doth conſiſt. For howſoeuer God may doo, and doth many waies good to the other creatures, in that hee feedeth and preſerueth them in their ſeuerall kindes, yet they not knowing GOD, cannot acknowledge thoſe good things, which they receiue from him, to come from him, and to proceed of that fauour which hee beareth vnto them: whereas the ſoule of the reaſonable creature, being as it were filled with the ſweete bleſſings of God, taketh greater pleaſure in the giuer then in the gift, and reioyceth yea glorieth more herein, that God the great King of heauen and earth, vouchſafeth to ſet his heart vpon it, and to take pleaſure in dooing it good, then in any other thing whatſoeuer. This ſenſe of the goodneſſe of GOD, as it is to them the moſt ſweete happineſſe that can be imagined, ſo it ſtirres vp in them a

mutuall loue towards God, whom although they cannot by any meanes eyther profit or pleaſure, yet they endeuour with all care to glorifie him by their holy obedience, and ſo to teſtifie that vnfained loue which they beare vnto him. But the vnreaſonable creatures wanting this ſence of the loue and goodneſſe of GOD, and ſo the reciprocation of loue which ſhould bee in them, wherein the force of loue conſiſteth, are for this cauſe not to bee admitted into the participation of the loue of God.
                     Beſides, the loue of God as it is eternal, ſo it hath this vertue, that on what ſubiect ſoeuer it ſeazeth, it maketh it eternall, preſeruing it from periſhing: but this cannot bee done in the other creatures, the which muſt bee diſſolued and come to nought: onely the reaſonable ſoule, being poſſeſſed and as it were filled with the loue of GOD, i
                           •
                         by preſerued for euer. For theſe cauſes it hath pleaſed GOD of his goodneſſe to make choiſe of the reaſonable nature of man, whereunto to ioyne himſelfe in the bonde of perfect loue: and in this reſpect to compare himſelfe to a carnall louer, enamoured of the bewtie of ſome fayre young woman, delighting himſelfe exceedingly in the fruition of her,

and deſiring nothing more then to pleaſe & pleaſure her, yea by all meanes poſsible to procure her good: as wee may ſee in the ſong of ſongs, in the Prophet Ez
                              •
                           chiel, & in diuers other places of ſcripture. In the ſecond place wee are to conſider, that not any meaſure of goodneſſe in the reaſonable creature, will ſerue to procure the loue of God, for then God ſhould loue the wicked, in whom wee knowe that there are diuers reliques of his image, yea euen the diuell himſelfe and all his wicked ſpirits, whoſe nature and naturall faculties are good, and not corrupted with ſinne in reſpect of their ſubſtance, but God doth not loue and embrace theſe with this affection of loue: for what fellowſhip or agreement, much leſſe intire loue, can God haue with Beliall, or light with darkneſſe? Nay rather wee knowe, that God doth moſt iuſtly hate and abhorre them, for that their perſons are not in regard of theſe reliques of goodneſſe to bee accounted good, becauſe it doth not preuaile in them, but is ouercome and captiuated, or rather aboliſhed by the contrarie corruption of ſinne, the which hauing the poſſeſsion and commaund of them, ought of right to haue the title and name of them. But God loueth the godly and their perſons, yea though they bee in part defiled

So that in man good and euill do in a manner contend for God, the one laboring to procure his loue, and the other his hatred, in the which conflict the ſtronger and the predominant qualitie preuaileth, and pulleth to the perſon in the which it is, the affection of God, eyther of loue, or elſe of hatred.

                     I had thoght that one, and that the leaſt corruption or ſinne in a man, had beene of ſufficient force to make the whole perſon hatefull & abhominable in the ſight of God, as a little leuen ſowreth the whole lumpe, according to that of the Apoſtle Iames, hee that breaketh any one poynt of the lawe, is guiltie of tranſgreſsing the whole, notwithſtanding there bee in him many good parts of holineſſe: euen as wee ſee in ciuill iudgements, that one ſingle crime condemneth a man, yea though in other reſpects his life bee neuer ſo iuſt and vnreprooueable.
                  
                  
                     Sch.
                     That is true you ſay, according to the exact rule of Gods iuſtice, the which requireth the full perfection of holineſſe without any exception, and reiecteth the whole, if neuer ſo litle of it be wanting: but the loue of God taketh another courſe, for it looketh on

men with an amiable and fauourable countenance, and (what maruell is it that the loue of God doth that which the loue of men is enioyned to performe) couereth the multitude of ſinnes. Laſtly, the loue of God neuer commeth emptie, but as God is the fountain and full treaſure of all pleaſure, ſo he bringeth with him whither ſoeuer hee commeth, all good, pleaſure and happineſſe, by the which his loue and affection towardes any perſon is known and felt. Yea hereof it followeth, that as any nature or perſon is indued with a leſſe or greater meaſure of this goodneſſe which is ſo pleaſing to the wil, and ſo agreeable to the nature of God, ſo it procureth to it ſelfe a leſſe or greater meaſure of the loue of God, and ſo conſequently of that pleaſant and happie good which doth continually accompanie it: yea that as God himſelf is the beſt and moſt excellent nature of all other, without any compariſon, ſo hee lou

                        th himſelfe farre more then he doth any other thing whatſoeuer, and procureth to himſelfe more pleaſure & happines, thē he doth to any creature. Yea it is his will, that according to this rule, this affection of loue in the godly be ſquared, to wit, that they loue thoſe moſt, in whom they ſee a greater meaſure of goodneſſe and godlineſſe, and bee more inclined towards them, to doo any manner of good vnto them,

then to any other, as it is Pſal. 16. 3. All my delight is in the ſaints on earth, euen to thoſe that are excellent. And ſo Gal. 6. 10.

                  BY this doctrine of the loue of God, wee may eaſily gather, what hatred the contrary affection is, to wit, a motion or act of Gods will, declining and abhorring the perſon wherein euill doth preuaile. And firſt, for the cauſe or ground of Gods hatred, wee muſt hold, that God doth not hate or abhor any creature, vpon the meere motion of his owne will, for his will neither doth nor can mooue eyther towards or from any creature, but vpon good and iuſt cauſe taken euen from his owne nature. Wee know that God of himſelfe loueth all his creatures, euen becauſe they are his owne workmanſhip, and therefore good and woorthie to bee both liked and loued, as immediately after the creation, hee behelde them, and ſeeing them to be good and excellent, euery one in his proper kinde, he powred downe his fauourable bleſsing vpon them, euen as the deawe and raine falleth vppon the hearbes and flowers of the fielde, whereby they waxe faire and flou
                        •
                     iſh. Neither did God eyther play the

diſſembler, in pretending loue to all his creatures, whereas hee hated many of them, or yet is he a changling, to turne his loue into hatred, but as once hee did, ſo alwaies hee doth both loue and bleſſe the creature which hee ſeeth to bee good. Yet if the creature at any time become euill, and bee not as it was made by him, but as it hath beene marred by it ſelfe, not bearing any longer his excellent and glorious image, but ſome other mōſtrous ſhape, then it cannot bee loued any longer, but muſt incontinently be hated of God. Yet God is the ſame that hee was, and not a whit altered, but the creature hath chaunged his place and condition, and is remooued, and as it were tranſplanted out of Gods pleaſant paradice, in the which it did flouriſh amidſt the foure riuers of the bleſsings of God, into a wide & wilde deſert, where it being ſchorched with the burning beames of gods curſe, withereth for want of water, and beeing cleane dried vppe, is become moſt deformed.

                     I could well agree, that loue ſhould haue place in God, both in his nature and in his actions, for as hee is the chiefe, and the very fountaine of all goodneſſe, ſo it ſeemeth very meet, that hee ſhould extend his goodneſſe to all his creatures, by doing good vnto

them all according to their ſeuerall kinds: but for this affection of hatred, I do not ſee how it can ſo well agree to the nature of God, it being by nature euill, and contrarie to the lou

                     If you graunt the one, you cannot deny the other, for as God is good, ſo hee muſt maintaine and vphold his goodneſſe againſt euill, by hating and abhorring it, yea by confounding all the maintainers and vpholders of it.

                     You will haue much ado to perſwade me, that God hateth any, although I confeſſe you make a ſhow of argument to proue it: but before we argue the matter, I would knowe whom, and how God hateth.

                     Indeed the ſtate of the queſtion would bee agreed vpon before diſputation, and it may eaſily be known if you call to mind that which hath been ſaid of the loue of God: for

firſt the reaſonable creature onely is the ſubiect, as of the loue, ſo alſo of the hatred of God, for of all the creatures in the world, the reaſonable onely can be and is euil. The reaſon hereof is, becauſe all other things as they were created good, ſo they continue in that ſtate of goodneſſe (and in reſpect of it, are in ſome ſort loued of God) although not in that degree of perfection and excellencie, God hauing (for the ſin of man) withdrawne from them ſome part of it: But man hath cleane forſaken that ſtate and ſtanding wherin he was placed by God, and loſt that goodneſſe for the which hee was ſo beloued of God. Yea not onely ſo, but alſo hee hath made an exchange of the ſaid goodneſſe, for the contrarie naughtineſſe, of knowledge & obedience, for ignorance, errour, rebellion and contempt, yea of the whole image of God, for the vgly ſhape of Sathan, and ſo is iuſtly become odious to God, to whom before he was dearely beloued.

Who would refuſe the offer of riches, honour, fauour and loue, made by his Prince vpon this condition, that if hee were found to bee traiterous, rebellious and diſloyall, hee ſhould not onely bee depriued of all the aforeſaid benefits, but alſo be moſt ſhamefully and miſerably to

But I pray you, were the conditions of mans felicitie ſo many to bee remembred, or ſo hard to be performed, that in reſpect of the great danger of falling into eternall miſerie (which was the forfaiture if hee failed) you would refuſe the fruition of Gods preſence, (& in it of eternall happineſſe) and chuſe to be a dead and ſenceleſſe ſtone, which hath neyther the poſſeſsion of pleaſure, nor the poſsibilitie of paine, rather then an happy man in ſo tickle an eſtate? who is ſo weake or intemperate, that would not for a ſmall commoditie

                     Indeed I muſt needes confeſſe that the condition of mans happineſſe in the beginning was ſo eaſie to be kept, that his conditionall eſtate of happineſſe may be accounted as good & ſure, as if it had been abſolute without any condition: and therefore I will yeeld vnto you, that the impoſsibilitie of happineſſe in the vnreaſonable creatures, was a farre woorſe eſtate then the poſsibilite of miſerie in man, the which (but that wee ſee & fee

freewill in their kindes) are as deep in naughtineſſe and peruerſeneſſe of nature, and ſo in the hatred of God, as man himſelfe. For I cannot thinke that they were created ſo violent, rauenous and bloodthirſtie as wee ſee & feel them, being more like helliſh feends, then earthly creatures. Yea, wee read Gen. 9. 5. that God will require the bloud of man at the hands of the beaſts which ſhedde it, as we know that in many caſes beaſts were by the Iudiciall lawe of Moſes condemned and put to death.

                     Sometimes you obiect in good earneſt, as I eaſily perceiue by you, but now I ſee you ſport and dally: for I am ſure you do not thinke that brute beaſts do ſinne againſt God, whom they cannot know. I doo not think but that rauenous beaſtes were created with the ſame weapons, both for offence and defence, the which now they vſe in purſuing their pray, and alſo in the ſame complexions and conditions which now they haue: but man in his innocencie was protected from them, not by the tameneſſe of their natures, but by a maieſtie inherent in his perſon, the which was of ſufficient force to amaze and controle the vnrulieſt of them. But wee will leaue the brute beaſts to their praies, & come to mē, whō this doctrine of gods hatred doth

concerne in reſpect of the ſinfulneſſe of their natures, into the which they haue tranſformed themſelues from that image of Gods holineſſe, wherein they were created. Yet not any meaſure of euill is ſufficient to procure this perſonall hatred, for then God ſhould hate the godly, in whom there are reliques of euill, as there are in the wicked of good, but onely raigning and preuailing euill. It is true indeed, that God hateth the leaſt ſinne that can be cōmitted or imagined, yea almoſt the ſhew of it, and euen the garment ſpotted with the fleſh, yet hee hateth not the perſon in regard of it, it beeing ſuppreſſed and kept vnder, for godlineſſe is ſtronger in them that are ſanctified (thogh imperfectly) & hauing ouercome ſinne, hath wonne the full intereſt of God and his loue. The other thing which you deſired to know before you would come to the queſtion it ſelfe, was the manner of Gods hatred, the which is two folde, inward, and outward. The ſirſt is the true maner of it: the other is the ſencible declaration of the inward, & is indeed the effect of it, as amōgſt men, outward harme is aſigne and alſo an effect of inward hatred. Now for this inward maner of fau

know it to be the generall and eternall antipathie and contrarietie of his nature, which is abſolute puritie, goodneſſe and holineſſe, to the pollution and naughtineſſe of ſinne preuailing in man: for as God doth approoue, loue and embrace his owne nature, as the abſolute perfection of goodneſſe, yea and the very image or likenes of the ſaid goodneſſe, eyther created or reſtored in man, ſo he cannot but miſlike and abhorre whatſoeuer is contrarie vnto it. Then followeth the outward manner, which is the effect and declaration of the inward hatred by bringing or doing euill to the perſon thus polluted with ſinne, from whom God hauing once turned away his face and fauour, it cannot bee, but that all maner of euils, as it were whole legions of diuels ſhould inuade him, as finding him not onely out of Gods protection, as a traitor & rebell, but alſo by gods iuſt iudgement appointed to many kinds of moſt fearfull iudgements.

                     Now I pray you let me aſke you a queſtion: are we according to Gods example, to hate wicked perſons, or rather (if it be vnmeete to make our ſelues preſidents for god to follow) is it not moſt true, ye
                         he doth not hate ye
                         wicked, but doth rather as he willeth vs to do, loue their perſons, and hate onely the ſinnes of men. For although

our duties do not belong to God, yet by that which he commaundeth, wee may gather what his nature is, for that all his commandements are iuſt, pure and agreeable to his nature. Yea to vrge this reaſon a little further, wee haue the expreſſe commaundement of Chriſt, Math. 5. 44. 45, To loue and to do good to our enemies, euen as God doth both to the iuſt and to the vniuſt.

                     Wee are not yet come to ſpeake of humane affections, yet this I ſay, that by this queſtion you do plainly ſhewe, what maketh this doctrine of Gods hatred ſeem ſo ſtrange and bee ſo harſh in your eares, namely becauſe hatred amongſt men is ſo corrupt a thing, bringing with it ſo many euils & miſchiefes. But we muſt not meaſure God by man, nor the one kinde of hatred by the other: for God hateth firſt by deteſting ſinne, and then by puniſhing the rebellion of him that hath committed it.
                  
                  
                     Gent.
                     Belike you make this hatred onely the execution of iuſtice done by God, as by a righteous iudge vpon malefactors, or as by a ſoueraigne king vpon open rebelles, and ſo a ſuppoſed hatred, for that hee that inflicteth puniſhment, ſeemeth to hate, as it is 1. Cor. 4. 21. Shall I come to you with a rod, or in loue? and if it bee ſo, me thinkes it were better

to call it iuſtice then hatred, the one word ſignifying a moſt corrupt, the other a moſt commendable thing.

                     The outward and actuall manner of Gods hatred, which is by doing euill to the ſinfull perſon, being in nothing diſagreeing from the rule of iuſtice, may not vnfitly bee ſo called, yet we need not feare to aſcribe hatred and deteſtation both of ſin in generall, and alſo of the particular perſons polluted with it, vnto God, hee hauing ſo often in ſcripture taken them vnto himſelfe. Otherwiſe if wee take hatred as it is vſually in and among men, then man is freed from all hatred of God, both by the goodneſſe of Gods nature, the which can neyther will nor doo euill to his creatures, but onely ſo farre forth as is needfull for the ſatiſfying of his iuſtice, and manifeſting of his glorie, and alſo by the baſeneſſe of his owne nature and eſtate, for what is man (a worme rather then a man) that god ſhould hate: the leaſt ſpark of whoſe anger is of force to conſume to nothing a thouſand worlds?

                  LIke vnto the aforeſaid affectiōs, are pleaſance & anger, the which alſo are often in ſcripture atributed to god, yet in truth thee

they haue no place in his nature, but onely are as reſemblances borrowed from man to declare the actions of God. The former doth better agree, and may more fitly bee attributed to God then the other, for it is an eſſentiall thing in God, to like or miſlike as things are good or euill. But as it is vſually taken for a ſuddaine & temporarie contentment or reſt of Gods will, hauing beene before ſtirred vp and mooued to anger, in this ſenſe, God cannot be properly ſaid to be eyther pleaſed or appeaſed, for hee was neuer diſpleaſed, it being impoſsible that any thing proceeding frō any creature (or indeed from himſelf) ſhuld worke any change or alteration in him. Likewiſe for anger, thogh it be in infinit places of ſcripture a
                        •
                     tributed to God, yet that he cannot by any meanes be prouoked vnto it. Onely hereby is ment, firſt, for the nature of God, that as he liketh and approoueth the obedience and puritie of the godly, ſo hee miſliketh the impuritie of the wicked as greatly, as men doo thoſe things whereat they are inflamed to anger, which is a certaine ſigne of diſcontentment. And ſecondly, for the outward and ſenſible actions of God, that hee vſeth as great ſeueritie (yet not paſsing ye
                      limits of iuſtice) as mē do being angrie, who vſually are rather too rigorous,

and paſſe the boundes of moderation in this behalfe: yea if we ſuppoſe (the which wee need not, it beeing ſo common a thing) the moſt outragious blaſphemies and horrible villanies which can be imagined, to bee committed by men, yet God is not thereby prouoked to anger, or any whit chaunged otherwiſe then he was before. He doth indeed abhorre ſinne, and puniſh ſinners as they do deſerue, but not in choller, or any violent paſsion, but by the eſſentiall and eternall motion, or rather immoueable act of his will, ſo affected to theſe obiects, as they doo eyther agree or diſagree from his diuine nature: and therfore this affection in God may more fitly be termed hatred, it being ſo conſtant and inueterate: to wit, eternall, not a ſudden and momentanie anger. Thus God ſaith, Exod. 23. 10. Let me alone and I will be angry at this people and conſume them: that is, I will conſume them as if I were angry: but if this affection of anger had bene truly ſtirred vp in God, he would haue ſaid I am angry, not, I will be angry. Likewiſe for ioy & ſorrow theſe affections alſo are attributed to God in ſcripture: yet no man is ſo ſimple, as to thinke that they do belong to God in truth: for nothing can happen to him eyther profitable or vnprofitable, nothing eyther pleaſant or vnpleaſant:

or rather nothing, but that which is not pleaſant vnto him, becauſe nothing can bee done againſt his will. But as for pittie and compaſſion, which is a ſorrow and greeuous ſenſe of the miſerie of an other, that the ſcripture doth ſo earneſtly aſcribe to God, and God in ſcripture ſo carefully challenge to himſelfe, as that wherein his cheefe glory doth conſiſt, that it may ſeeme very hard and not to bee admitted, that ſuch great matters ſhould bee turned into ſhadowes and reſemblances. For ſo we reade, Exod. 33. 19. That when as God would at the earneſt ſute of Moyſes ſet forth himſelfe and his nature in his greateſt glory, hee deſineth himſelfe by thi
                        •
                      one attribute, ſaying, I will make all my good to go before thee, and I will proclame the name of the Lord before thee, to wit, I will haue mercie on whom I will haue mercie, and I will ſhew compaſſion, to whom I will ſhew compaſſion. And without queſtion, if any humane affection may bee truly ſaid to bee in God, it is this of pittie, the which of all other is moſt excellent and commendable, proper to gentle, noble and royall mindes, as nothing is ſo baſe and ſauage, as is vnmercifulneſſe and crueltie.
                  But the truth is, that there are no manner of paſsions in God, his nature beeing impaſsible:

onely by the pittie of God in ſcripture is ment, that God as hee is infinitly and onely good, yea the fountaine of all goodneſſe, ſo he is moſt prone and ready to impart and extend the ſame to all his creatures, eſpecially vnto thoſe which being miſerable, doo ſtand in greateſt need of his helpe and comfort.
                  This may be plainely ſeene in thoſe iudiciall lawes, which hee gaue to his people by Moſes, wherein it may worthely bee noted how carefull the Lord is for the helping and releeuing of all thoſe which are any way diſtreſſed, as namely the poore, the widowe, the orphane, and the ſtraunger, that men ſhould not onely take heede of iniurying them any way, (for ſaith he, Exod. 22. 27 although thou bee cruell in oppreſſing thy poore brother, yet I am pittifull and cannot abide it, but will puniſh thee for it) but alſo be carefull to releeue them with the crop and vintage of the ſeuenth yeare, and by leauing them ſome gleanings in the yearely harueſt, by ſetting them free out of bondage at the ſeuenth yeare. Yea this compaſſion of the Lord extendeth it ſelfe euen to the brute beaſt, and therefore he commanded, that they ſhuld not be ouerwrought, but be ſuffered to reſt the 7

day, that the ſeuenth yeares crop ſhould bee left for them in part, that the young Kid ſhould not be ſod in the mothers milke, nor the damme taken in the neaſt with the yong birdes: and ſo in many other particulars, we cannot but ſee in reading theſe lawes, what great care and compaſsion God had ouer all his creatures, which were in miſerie, or any way diſtreſſed.

                     Sect. 1.
                  
                     Gent.
                     
                        YOu will not, mee thinkes, admit into the nature of God any ſudden and momentanie motions, & therfore no affectiōs: but what ſay you to conſtant habits of good, as iuſtice, goodneſſe, and ſuch other excellent vertues? will you exclude theſe alſo out of the nature of God, or admit them onely in name and in ſhew as you do the affections?
                  
                  
                     
                     Sch.
                     Theſe things, and whatſoeuer elſe, is not onely indifferent as are the affections, but euen ſimply good, haue place in the nature of god, not onely truly, but alſo primarely, as in their roote and firſt fountaine, from the which, they are deriued to the creatures.
                  
                  
                     Gent.
                     I pray you declare them in particular.
                  
                  
                     Sch.
                     It is more meete if not needfull, to breake off our conference for this time: I dare ſay, I haue wearied you with ſpeaking ſo long of one matter.
                  
                  
                     Gent.
                     Of one matter? cal you this one matter? nay it is all in all. Alas god helpe vs if one afternoones cōference of God do make vs wearie: this being the onely leſſon, in the learning whereof, all that hope to bee in Gods kingdome, muſt make account to ſpend, not houres, daies, years or ages, but eternities, that is, time which is endleſſe, and will neuer bee ſpent.
                  
                  
                     Sch.
                     It is true that you ſay, yet you ſee our weakeneſſe to be ſuch, that wee are ſoone wearied and cloyed with hearing ſtill of one matter, although it concerne vs neuer ſo much, eſpecially if it be thus rudely and rawly handled.
                  
                  
                     Gent.
                     Well, well, I can aſſure you, there is

no ſuch matter, and (but that I hope to haue your company to morrowe and the next day alſo) I ſhould wiſh (the which I thinke fewe trauellers do) to haue the way lengthened, and that we had many houres riding to our lodging, as now we haue not aboue one. But if your ſelfe be wearie of ſpeaking and of my vnskilfull queſtioning with you of this, and that, you may be the ſhorter: and I will promiſe you not to trouble you with any moe queſtions, but to ſuffer you to ſpeake and to holde your peace at your owne pleaſure,
                  
                  
                     Sch.
                     Your queſtioning hath bene no trouble but a great eaſe and profit to me. I will (if there be no remedie) ſhew you breefely the nature of ſomeof this kind of attributes, which may not vnfitly bee called the vertues of God. You may by them gather the nature of the reſt.
                  
                  
                     Gent.
                     I pray you do ſo: I would be loath we ſhuld leaue this daies conference imperfect: but make an end of it once in, & thē I wil ſay, that we haue made, a good daies worke of it.
                  
                  
                     Sch.
                     I wiſh wee had many Gentlemen of your minde, ſo deſirous of knowledge, eſpecially of the knowledge of God: wee may well wiſh it, but it were folly to think it, and in vaine to hope it: but to the matter.
                     
                        
You know that thoſe good and commendable diſpoſitions of the minde, which are commonly called morall vertues, are of two ſortes, whereof the one looketh inwardly toward our ſelues, the other outwardly toward others.
                     The firſt kinde conſiſteth in the moderation of the deſire and vſe of worldly pleaſures, as of meate, drinke, eaſe, paſtime, riches, honour, and whatſoeuer elſe is pleaſant in the life of man.
                     Theſe vertues are not to bee attributed to GOD, becauſe his nature is not capable of theſe pleaſures. He indeed liueth or rather exiſteth in the perfection of pleaſure, for hee doth continually and eternally delight and reioyce in himſelfe and in no other thing (in compariſon, as no other thing is to bee compared to him in goodneſſe) for although hee take pleaſure in the goodneſſe of his creatures, whereby they reſemble him, as in their knowledge wiſdome, puritie, bewty, and whatſoeuer elſe is good in them, yet all this is nothing to that infinit goodneſſe which is reſident in himſelfe, affoording vnto him matter of vnſpeakeable pleaſure, the whieth is not to be limitted within the bounds of any vertues, for it cannot haue either defect, moderation or exceſſe, and al, for that it is infinit.

And what maruell is it, if God be exempted from theſe vertues, and the pleaſures which are the obiects of them, when as the Angels, which are creatures, are not ſubiect vnto thē? for they cannot be ſaid to bee eyther temperate in regard of meate and drinke, or continent in reſpect of bodely pleaſures, for that their nature is not capable of thoſe pleaſures, no more then are trees or ſenceleſſe ſtones. Yet theit nature is capable both of vertue and alſo of vice: for as by vertue ſome of them ſtand in happineſſe, ſo by vice many of them fell into miſerie: to wit, through ambition, as it is thought, for deſiring to be higher, they became lower then they were created. This vice (as alſo the vertue of it, which being but the moderation of it, muſt needs be of the ſame kinde with the vice) is incident into all excellent natures: as wee knowe that euery nature doth deſire to increaſe in that good, wherewith it is already endued: yea the more it hath of it, the more it doth deſire, becauſe it feeleth ſo much the more the ſweetneſſe of it, and ſo we ſee it to come to paſſe, that none are ſo deſirous of riches, as is the richeſt, of knowledge, as are the beſt learned: and of excellencie: as thoſe that are alreadie moſt excellent, euen as the fire, the pureſt of all the elements, doth neuer reſt, till it be aboue all

the reſt, and in the higheſt place of dignitie Yea as the vertue which is care of credit and honour, and alſo the exceeding extreame, which is ambition, ſo alſo humilitie (which may ſeeme to be the lower extreame, but is in truth, the higheſt and moſt excellent vertue) may be moſt plainely ſhewed, and fully exerciſed in that nature which is moſt excellent. For as none can haue ſo great a fall, as he that hath the higheſt place, ſo none can ſhewe ſo great humilitie, as he that is moſt excellent, becauſe none can debaſe himſelfe ſo far, as he that is higheſt in excellencie. Whereby it may be gathered, that although God cannot be ſaid to bee ambitious in deſiring greater honour then is due vnto him for that he hath by right, all honour that can bee eyther had or deſired, yet we may truly ſay that he may haue both the greateſt humilitie in laying aſide the greateſt excellencie, and alſo a due care of credit and of maintaining his iuſt honour againſt al vniuſt vſurpers whatſoeuer.
                     Thus the ſcripture teacheth vs, that God is not onely carefull, but euen curious, as wee may ſay, and as it ſelfe ſaith, iealous of his honour, the which he cannot abide that it ſhuld bee any touched or impared, as hee doth openly profeſſe of himſelfe, Eſ. 48. 11. My
                        
                        glory I will not giue to any other. Neither indeed will he ſuffer any to take it, or any portion of it, but doth ſtraightway confound them all with all their deuices, whoſoeuer do any way obſcure it, much more ſuch as haue moſt impiouſly, yet more fooliſhly ſought to vſurpe or participate it.
                     Thus were the aſpyring ſpiri
                           •
                        s throwne from heauen into the place and pit of darkeneſſe to the which man alſo (treading in the ſame ſteps of ſacrilegious pride) was ſent out of paradiſe to beare them cōpany. Thus were the vaineglorious builders of the Tower of Babel confounded in al their deuiſes, and thus the Lord ſlewe 50000. of the preſumptuous Bethſemites, who by looking into the A
                           •
                        ke brought the name and preſence of God into contempt. Thus he made proude Nabuchadneſar, who thought that hee might with the maieſtie of his perſon and Pallace outface the ſunne in heauen, yea God himſelf, whoſe glory filleth both heauen & earth, to become as a ſilly and miſerable beaſt: and thus he confounded Herode by a filthy diſeaſe that tooke to himſelfe the glorious tytle of God, which the flattering people aſcribed vnto him. Neither need we maruell, that God is ſo carefull in maintaining his honour and glory, it being the laſt and chiefe end of the creation of all

things, all which tend to this one end, and euen bend their whole forces to maintaine & vphold the glory of God as of the higheſt and greateſt good, euen as we ſee loyall ſubiects to endeauor nothing ſo much as to maintaine the maieſtie and honor of their Prince: as we read, Rom. 11. 36. Of him, by him and for him are all things, to him be praiſe for euer. For if God ſhould ſuffer any falſe or fained God, any man or Angell to vſurpe any royall prerogatiue belonging to the godhead, and ſo himſelfe to be diſgraced, and his maieſtie diminiſhed, the confuſion of all things (as of the ſtreames the fountaine being troubled) muſt of neceſsitie follow. And yet god is not ſo deſirous of aduancing his name and glory, but that he can on the other ſide debaſe himſelfe, when hee thinketh meete as beeing endued with humilitie in as great, or rather in greater meaſure.
                  
                  
                     Gent.
                     me thinks, that humilitie doth not well agree with the nature of God, and that there is ſmall vſe of humiliation in his doings.
                  
                  
                     Sch.
                     As God doth aduance others beeing humble, ſo he doth by his humilitie, not debaſe, but honour and magnifie himſelfe: for as wee ſee it to come to paſſe in Princes and other great perſonages, that nothing doth make them to bee loued, honoured and

extolled, ſo much as doth their gentle and familiar behauiour with their ſubiects and inferiours: ſo God is exalted in his humilitie, and made moſt glorious in it. Pſal. 113. The Lord is aboue all Nations, and his glory aboue the heauens, who is like vnto our God, that hauing his habitation in the higheſt heauen, doth debaſe himſelfe to behold things on earth? Yea not onely to behold them a farre off, but alſo to haue a hand and a part in them. Princes do not vſe to conuerſe much with their ſubiects, but that any of them ſhould ſo farre debaſe himſelfe, as to take vpon him the condition of a ſubiect, and to ſuffer his owne ſubiects, to rule and inſult ouer him, yea to vſe him deſpightefully and contumeliouſly, that is a thing neuer heard of neither ſuppoſed to be poſsible to be brought to paſſe, but that they wold rather looſe both their kingdomes and their liues, then ſuffer ſuch a diſgrace eſpecially at the hands of their ſubiects. But God the King of Kings did leaue his Throne of maieſtie in heauen, and made one litle Caue or hole of the earth (all which before was but his footeſtoole) his chayre of eſtate: yea he tooke to himſelfe the forme of weake and fraile man, not of a Lord or King, but of a baſe ſeruant, yea of a vile and loathſome ſinner: hee ſuffered himſelfe to be taunted and

reuiled, yea which is the greateſt diſgrace in the world) to bee ſpit on, as a moſt vile and filthy thing: who can imagine, muſt leſſe alleadge an example of ſo great humilitie? yet herein God is moſt glorious.
                     This one inſtance of his extreame humiliation, maketh it needleſſe to alleadge his familiar conuerſing with men heere one earth, his familiar conferring with Moſes face to face, as one friend doth with another: his anſwering them to all their demaunds, as it were comming at their call, whereof wee haue many examples in the ſcripture, as namely in Abraham, pleading ſo hard for Sodome and in the ſtory of Dauid, 1. Sam. 29. 8, who there aſketh one queſtion after an other of God about his worldly affaires, as if he had bene aduiſing with ſome familiar friend: but that one example of his vnſpeakeable humilitie ſhewed in his incarnation, and in ſuffering all the miſeries of our life, and in the ende, that moſt ſhamefull death, is ſo notable, that it can neuer bee ſufficiently admired.
                  
               
               
                  
                  
                     Sect. 2.
                  THeſe two onely which haue bene declared, of all thoſe vertues which concerne our ſelues, are attributed to god: but of thoſe which tend and reach to others, many may very fitly and truly be aſcribed vnto him, to ſhew the manner of his dealing with men, as namely iuſtice in recompēcing, indulgence in forbearing, faithfulneſſe in performing promiſes, and goodneſſe in dooing good to men. For the firſt, namely iuſtice, it doth belong vnto God, in reſpect of that ſoueraigne authoritie, which he hath ouer al the creatures in the world, as well Princes as ſubiects, as well men as Angels, hee beeing by vertue of the creation, wherein hee made them all of nought, their moſt naturall King, and the onely abſolute Monarch of the world: all other Kings and Rulers whatſoeuer, being but his ſubſtitutes and vicegerents, holding their Crownes and Kingdomes of him, as uaſſalles of their liege Lord and maiſter: and ruling by him, from him, and in his name and ſteed, yea and by his lawes. For howſoeuer God haue permitted the ordering of their ſubiects in great part to their will and diſcretion, yet he hath giuen and publiſhed

to the whole world, his owne ſupreme and vniuerſall lawes, to the obſeruing whereof, all without any exception are bound by his commaundement and the violating whereof he doth moſt ſeuerely puniſh. But as no ſtate or Common-wealth can ſtand by penal lawes onely, which reſtraine vice by threatnings, and puniſh offences committed by due paines, becauſe it is needefull that there ſhould alſo be rewards appointed, whereby the vertuous endeauours of good ſubiects may be recompenced and encouraged, in the right diſpoſing and diſtributing whereof iuſtice hath place as well as in inflicting the deſerued puniſhment vpon offenders: ſo is the iuſtice of God, whereby he adminiſt
                        •
                     eth the Kingdome or Common-wealth of the world, of two ſortes, the one in Paenâ, the other in Praemio, the one in due puniſhment, the other in meete rewards. For the firſt kind, the lawes which concerne the puniſhing of ſin are not many, for they are but one, giuen to all mankind in the perſon of Adam, Gen. 2. 17. In the day that thou ſhalt eate, thou ſhalt die: And Rom. 6. 23. The wages of ſin is death: The which is the onely puniſhment (yet diuerſly inflicted according to the diuerſitie of ſins) appointed for al ſins and offences committed againſt God, as well for the leaſt, as for the greateſt,
                  
                     
This death beginneth with our life, during y• which God layeth vpon the ſinner, many euilles and miſeries, all which are forerunners of that eternall death and miſerie, which abideth in the world to come. And that mē ſhuld know and acknowledge, that theſe temporal euilles come from God as puniſhments of their ſinnes, hee doth vſually puniſh them in the ſame kind wherein they haue ſinned, that ſo the likeneſſe which the puniſhment hath vnto the ſinne, may ſhew it to bee the ſonne of that father, and the frute of that tree, Gen. 2 17. Becauſe thou haſt eaten of the forbidden frute, thou ſhalt all the dayes of thy life eate in toile, and in the ſweat of thy browes. And Gen. 20. 8. The Lord had ſhut vp all the wombes in the houſe of Abimelec, becauſe of Sarah Abrahams wife. And Iud. 1. 7. And Adombezek ſaid, ſeuentie Kings hauing the thumbes of their hands and of their feete cut off, gathered vnder my table, as I haue done ſo God hath rewarded me. And 1. Cor. 1. 21. After that the world wold not by the wiſedome of God knowe God, it pleaſed God (as a iuſt puniſhment) by the fooliſhneſſe of preaching, to ſaue the beleeuers. All which actions of God, as wel in his temporal, as in eternal puniſhmēts we are not to doubt, but that they are ſquared according to yt rules of iuſtice, from the which it is impoſſible that God would ſwarue.
                  
                     
                     Gent.
                     It were impietie to thinke and blaſphemie to ſpeake the contrarie: and yet to tel you plainly, I haue been more troubled with doubts about this point of Gods iuſtice, then in any other: and but for troubling and hindering you in your courſe, I would declare them vnto you, in hope to bee more fully reſolued in this.
                  
                  
                     Sch.
                     You ſhall not hinder but further mee, I will willingly doo my beſt to ſatiſfie you.
                  
                  
                     Gent.
                     I haue often thought vpon occaſion of heating this doctrine, that the puniſhment due vnto the leaſt ſinne, is by the iuſtice of god eternal death, that ſome Atheiſts might ſay of Gods lawes, as it was ſaide of Dracos laws giuē to the Athenians, yt they were written with blood, & wold accuſe God of crueltie, for infflicting ſo great or rather ſo endles and infinite a puniſhmen vpon ſmall ſinnes, yea vpon thoſe which may be doubted whither they be ſins or no, as namely to let paſſe the inward thoughts and deſires, (the which although they bee actuall, yet they are in the loweſt degree of act that can bee) originall ſinne in infants, the which is eyther alienum, another mans, and therefore not iuſtly imputed to thē, or if you take it as it is inherent in themſelues, it is but an inclination to ſinne,

not ſinne indeed and in act. Beſides how ſhould wee thinke that ſo greeuous a puniſhment as is eternall death, can without extreame rigor bee inflicted vpon many thouſands of men, that did neuer heare tell of god or of his word, eyther in the lawe or in the goſpell, as are thoſe poore Indians, which haue in this laſt age beene diſcouered, whom in all reaſon ineuitable ignorance ſhould excuſe, howſoeuer wilfull ignorance bee made damnable. Theſe doubts and diuers other, wherewith I will not trouble you, haue often runne in my minde, yet I doubt not but that God is iuſt in all actions, or rather I doubt whither God can bee ſaid to be vuiuſt, whatſoeuer hee doth to his creatures, yea though he ſhould inflict extreame puniſhment vpon the moſt righteous man in the world, for hee hath abſolute power ouer thē all, as the potter hath of his claye to diſpoſe of it as hee liſt himſelfe, and wee know, that it is lawfull for a man to do to his owne what he will.
                  
                  
                     Sch.
                     I am not of your opinion, or rather that opinion which you name, that it were not iniuſtice in God, to puniſh a righteous man altogither voy de of ſin: for not to alleadge the promiſe and couenant of life, which god hath made to man beeing righteous, but to ſuppoſe that God had not bound himſelfe by any

ſuch promiſe, the abſolute power of God ouer his creatures, will indeed bee a warrant vnto him, not onely to diſpoſe of them according to his own pleaſure, but euen to conſume thē al to naught, as in the beginning he made them all of naught, but yet not to inflict extream puniſhments where there is no ſinne: for ſo God ſhould doo that which is contrarie to his owne nature, the which doth neceſſarely incline it ſelfe towards the goodneſſe of the creature, by doing to it not euill but good, and therefore hee ſhould doo euill and that which is vniuſt, or rather hee ſhould do that, which it is impoſsible for him to do. But as touching your obiectiōs againſt the iuſtice of God, I anſwere, that wee muſt not thinke ſinnes committed againſt God to be ſo ſmall, as they ſeeme in themſelues and when they are committed againſt men: for the greatneſſe of the maieſtie of god make
                           •
                        h the leaſt ſinne to bee moſt hainous, euen as wee knowe that the leaſt indecent behauiour towards a Prince, is thought woorthie to bee puniſhed with death: and not onely outward & actuall rebelliōs, but alſo the very thoghts and purpoſes of the mind tending to treaſon, are accounted moſt hainous crimes, yea ſo hainous, as for them not onely the offendant himſelfe, but alſo all his poſteritie for euer are thought worthie to be depriued of all thoſe

dignities and commodities, whatſoeuer they did enioy by the liberalitie of the Prince, or yet within his dominions. Yet wee need not ſay, that God doth puniſh infants for Adams ſinne, for they haue in themſelues ſufficient matter of damnation, their whole nature being actually corrupted in reſpect of y•
                         image of God, for the which cauſe it is woorthely loathed and abhorred of God. As for the infidels which haue not the word of God, whereby to learne and know God, you may remember how the Apoſtle Rom. 1. in the latter part or half of the chapter, doth plainly prooue that they do wilfully ſinne againſt the light of nature ſhining in the creatures, yea that they do obſtinately contemne god, whom they might learn out of the creatutes, to be moſt maieſticall & woorthie, to whom all obedience, honor and thankfulnes ſhould be performed. And laſtly, I ſay that as none in this world can charge God with crueltie, ſo in the world to come, the wicked themſelues ſhal cōfeſſe al their puniſhments to be moſt iuſt.

                     What ſay you thē, to thē that accuſe god of iniuſtice, in reſpect of his partial dealing with men, in that he reiecteth and condemneth ſome to eternall death, and yet electeth and ſpareth others, who are euery way as ſinfull, and as vnworthie of fauour?
                  
                  
                     
                     Sch.
                     I am ſure you will not call that Prince partiall or vniuſt, that ſheweth fauor and giueth life to ſome malefactors, for a teſtimonie of his goodneſſe and clemencie, although hee ſuffer others to bee put to death for the ſame offence: no more is God vniuſt in ſauing ſome from eternall death, the which the reſt are to ſuffer, and which all of vs do moſt iuſtly deſerue. Yea if we do conſider the maner and the meanes, by the which God doth ſaue theſe his elect from the death which they deſerue, we ſhall bee farre ynough off, from imagining any partiall dealing in him. For howſoeuer hee did fully determine, and moſt earneſtly deſire, to ſaue ſome from eternall death, yet his iuſtice would not in any caſe ſuffer that to be done, vnleſſe and vntill the death and puniſhment due vnto their ſinnes, were fully ſuffered by ſome other in their behalfe. Wherof it came, that (no creature beeing able to ſuſtaine it) God himſelfe was faine to do it, and ſo did debaſe himſelf to a ſhamefull death, the which what was it elſe but the confuſion of all things, that God ſhould lay aſide his glorie & maieſtie, to ſuffer ſhame & ignon inie? and yet al this hee did becauſe his infinit iuſtice would admit no partiall dealing. Yea ſo great is the iuſtice of God, that it cannot bee peruerted

by that moſt tender loue which he beareth to his elect, beeing now both redeemed by the death of Chriſt, & alſo ſanctified by his own ſpirit, but that hee doth ſtill lay vpon them grecuous puniſhments for thoſe ſins, whereby they do diſpleaſe and diſhonour him. 1. Pet. 4. 17. The time is come that iudgement ſhall beginne at the houſe of God, and if it do beginne with vs, where ſhall the wicked appeare, that is, he will be farre leſſe partiall and more ſeuere with them. For ſin is as ſeed caſt into the ground, which multiplyeth it ſelfe, and commeth foorth with aduantage to the ſower, yea although hee bee otherwiſe a godly and iuſt man. Thus God dealt with Dauid, a man according to his owne heart, repaying him the iniuries done to Vriah, from whom hee tooke both his wife, and alſo his life, in full yea in ouerrunning meaſure, making his owne ſon to take from him his wiues, crown, kingdome, children, and well nigh his life alſo. Yea this aduantage or ouerplus, which Dauid receiued at the hands of Godbeſides the principal, is noted 2. Sam. 12. 12. Thou diddeſt ſinne ſecretly, but I will pay the before all Iſraell, euen in the face of the ſunne.
                     
                  
                  
                     Gent.
                     Doo you call this iuſtice, or is it not rather iniuſtice, to make the faithfull beare in their own perſons the puniſhment of their

ſinnes, which Chriſt hath already borne to the full.
                  
                  
                     Sch.
                     It is without queſtion that God bringeth euen vpon the godly, for thoſe ſinnes whereby they diſhonour him, moſt bitter and fearefull euils, yea (as I haue heard that a godly man vſeth to ſay) that God neuer ſuffereth any great ſinne committed by any of them, to ſcape vnpuniſhed: and that not only for their chaſtiſement and amendement, which is the vſuall end of their afflictions, but alſo euen for this end, to make them teſtimonies and examples of his ſeueritie, iuſtice, and vnpartiall dealing, for hee doth often puniſh them in their poſteritie after their death, as he did Eli his negligence in not correcting the miſdemeanor of his ſonnes, & the idolatrie of Salomon, by taking away ten of the twelue tribes from his ſucceſſours. Yet there is a difference betwixt their ſuffering, and the ſuffering of Chriſt, who did ſuffer for this end, to ſatiſfie Gods iuſtice for the ſins of the elect, the which they cannot do either in whole or in part: for if they were put to ſatiſfie Gods iuſtice but for the leaſt of their ſinnes, they ſhould ſuffer not onely temporally, but alſo eternally, and ſo ſhould periſh: but Chriſt onely ſuffereth for the ſatiſfaction, and they for the declaration of Gods iuſtice.
                  
               
               
                  
                  
                     Sect. 3.
                  BVt wee may not ſtay any longer in this part of his iuſtice, wee muſt now briefly conſider the other, to wit, the remuner atiue iuſtice, by the which hee rewardeth the goodneſſe of his reaſonable creatures.
                  
                     Gent.
                     You need not be long in this point, for I thinke there is ſmall vſe of it: not but that God is moſt bountifull in rewarding thoſe that do deſerue, but for that none (except the Angels) doo or can deſerue any reward at the hands of god, for their obedience and good, being imperfect and polluted with ſinne, are ſo farre from deſeruing rewardes, that they cannot poſsibly ſtand before the ſeate of Gods iuſtice and iudgement, but are reiected as ſilthie menſtruous clou
                           •
                        es, as the ſcripture ſpeaketh.
                  
                  
                     Sch.
                     You ſay true, that according to the ſtrickt rigor of Gods law and iuſtice, our beſt works are ſo far from deſeruing reward, that they deſerue eternall death. But there is a time and vſe as for the rigor, ſo alſo 
                           •
                        or the mitigation of Gods iuſtice, in the which it pleaſeth God of his mercie and goodneſſe to paſſe ouer & ouer ſee the imperfections and ſinfulneſſe of mans obedience and workes,

and both to promiſe in word, & to performe in deed competent rewards, as he ſeeth moſt meete, and that not onely to the godly, but euen to the wicked. For the firſt, the retribution of good to the godly, hath place both in this life and alſo in the life to come. Not that God doth alwaies reward the godly with tē
                        porall benefits, for that is not alwaies good for them for their eternall ſaluation, in reſpect whereof god ſeeth it often to be needfull that they ſhould liue, yea and end their daies alſo vnder the croſſe in greeuous afflictions: yet this temporall retribution is neuer wholly wanting, but is found if not at one time, yet at another: if not in their life time, and in their owne perſons, yet in their graues, and in their childers children, euen to the thouſant generation: if not ſo fully as fleſh and blood deſire, yet ſo that they may plainly acknowledge the goodneſſe & rewarding hand of God. Thus God promiſeth at large, Deut. 29. that they which feare and obey him, ſhall euen be compaſſed about with all maner of bleſsings, that euery thing y•
                         belongeth vnto them, and that they take in hand, ſhall proſper and haue good ſucceſſe, as the Apoſtle witneſſeth, 1. Tim. 4. 1. That godlineſſe is profitable in all reſpects, hauing the promiſe both of this life, and of the life to come: and

Chriſt himſelfe Math. 19. 29. Hee that forſaketh any worldly thing for my ſake and the goſpels, ſhall both inherit eternall life, and alſo receiue an hundred folde euen in this life. Thus God did from one generation to another, & thus hee will doo euen vnto the ende of the world, both remember and alſo recompence the godlineſſe of his ſeruants, Abraham, Dauid and others: and thus he made a couenant with Phinees, in regard of that hi
                           •
                         zealous loue of his glorie, to bleſſe and honour both him and his poſteritie from age to age. Thus God hath done, and thus he will do in all ages: yet with this difference, that the greater meaſure of ſpiritual graces the godly haue, the leſſe need they haue of temporal bleſsings to confirme and cheriſh their faith: and the nearer they come to the fruitiō of eternal glorie the more they may & ought to contemne worldly pleaſures: whence it is that this temporall retribution is not ſo plentifull, and ſo apparant in theſe ages of the goſpell, which flow in abundance of ſpirituall graces, as it was before when they were ſcant.
                     But that which is wanting and doubtfull in this life, ſhall without doubt bee fully performed in the life to come, where the obedience and good workes, the afflictions and patience of the godly, ſhall be rewarded, not

only with iuſt praiſe & commendation, (the which reward is deſerued, and agreeable to the nature of their workes, and is mentioned 1. Cor. 3. 14. 15. If any mans worke ſtand, hee ſhall haue wages or recompence, but if it faile, he ſhall want that recompence, and yet be ſaued) but alſo with eternall happineſſe: the which althogh it paſſe by a thouſand degrees, the deſert, or rather although it cannot in any part or reſpect bee deſerued by any obedience of the faithfull in this life, becauſe all their obedience is imperfect, yet it pleaſeth God in mercie to call it a reward, yea to bee content that they looke for it in that name, as wee ſee that the Apoſtle doth, 2. Tim. 4. 7. 8. I haue fought a good fight, and haue kept the faith: from hence foorth I am to expect that crowne of rightteouſneſſe, which the Lord that righteous iudge ſhall giue me. And ſo Rom. 8. 8. although the afflictions of this life bee not worthy to haue ſuch a reward, as is the glorie of the life to come, yet hee maketh the one to depend on the other.
                  
                  
                     Gent.
                     Mee thought you ſaide, that the rewarding iuſtice of God is ſo great, that it extendeth it ſelfe euen to the reprobate, recompencing their good deedes (if they may be called good) with bleſsings:

but what fruite can bee looked for from the roote of infidelitie, but corrupt, the which if God ſhould reward, what ſhould he do elſe, but bolſter and maintaine them in their ſin?
                  
                  
                     Sch.
                     God doth reward with good, not the wicked deedes of vngodly and vniuſt men, but the honeſt & vpright actions of ſuch as are ciuilly and morally vertuous, yea & perhaps affected with ſome blind zeal of religion: the which although they cannot merit before Gods iudgement ſeat, being not onely imperfect and in part ſinfull, as are the actions of the godly, but alſo wholly ſinfull, in that they come from an euill roote, yet they haue reſpects of good, the which God rewardeth with temporall bleſsings, as hee did Achabs outward repentance and humilation, with immunitie frō thoſe temporall plagues, which belonged to his ſinnes. And thus did God reward Iehu Achabs ſucceſſor, for executing his anger & vengenace vpon Achabs houſe, with the honour of the kingdome to the fourth generation. Thus you haue heard ſomewhat of Gods iuſtice, the which althogh it ſhall without doubt haue the full ſway at length in puniſhing and confounding the wicked, yet for the time of this life, it is ſuſpended and kept frō executing the full force vpon them, that ſo there may be place, vſe,

and declaration for another vertue of God, called patience and long ſuffering, the which who cannot but admire, that conſidereth the horrible outrages, blaſphemies, curſings, and all manner of contemptuous and ſpiteful impietie, which the vngodly do daily ſpew out againſt God & his holy trueth, and yet they go not onely vnpuniſhed, but alſo proſper and flouriſh as if they were bleſſed of God, who doth by this patience onely harden them to their eternall deſtruction.
                  
               
               
                  
                     Sect. 4.
                  THere remaineth now to be conſidered in a word or two, the laſt knot of diuine vertues conſiſting in Gods naturall inclination to do good vnto his creatures: they may be called by the generall name of goodneſſe, to the which his general fauour to all, his particular friendſhippe with ſome fewe and his fidelitie or faithfulneſſe both to the one and to the other, may bee referred. For as hee is onely good, that is, the firſt fountaine and ful treaſure of all good things, ſo he doth not enuiouſly keep it wholy to himſelf, but doth graciouſly impart it to others, euen to all liuing things, baſe and excellent, good and euill, reaſonable and vnreaſonable, one

and other, all of them doo eyther drinke or taſte of this ſweet cuppe of Gods goodneſſe and bleſsings. Hee ſuffereth his raine to fall vpon the iuſt and vpon the vniuſt, hee feedeth and filleth all thinges liuing with a plentifull hand, there is no ende or meaſure of his goodneſſe. For why, he hath a fauour vnto them, as a father hath to his children, and as a ſkilfull workeman to the workes of his owne handes, wherein his nature and Image, or his ſkill and cunning do plainly appeare.
                  Yea, ſo great is his goodneſſe towardes them, that hee vouchſafeth to enter into bondes and couenants with them, binding himſelfe to them by promiſes and oathes, for the performance of that good vnto them, which commeth from him, not as of neceſſitie and by conſtraint, or yet by their deſert, but onely of meer fauour and his naturall goodneſſe. In the performance whereof hee is ſo ſure, yea ſo carefull as wee ſee honeſt men to bee in keeping their promiſes, that the whole worlde ſhall ſooner faile, then any iot of that which hee hath promiſed. Whereof we may gather, how odious to God is the impietie of thoſe men or rather blaſphemous monſters, that are

not aſhamed to call into queſtion, if not flatly to denie, the trueth of that which God hath from time to time promiſed to his Church, as touching eternall happineſſe in the world to come: yea, and that the faithfull themſelues, while they often doubt within themſelues of the trueth and fidelitie of GOD, in making good whatſoeuer hee hath ſpoken, doo no doubt greatly both diſpleaſe and diſhonour God.
                  But moſt of all in this kinde, wee are to admire the friendſhippe and familiaritie which it pleaſeth God to haue with men, yea with ſinfull and mortall men, to ſome of whom hee vouchſafeth not onely this generall fauour, whereof all the creatures in the world are partakers, and that eternall loue which bringeth with it eternall ſaluation, but alſo a more ſpeciall fauour, admitting them into his ſecret counſell and acquaintance, as men doo ſome ſpeciall and approoued friends.
                  Thus wee reade that Enoch walked with GOD, that Moſes did ordinarely talke and conferre with him face to face, as one friende doth with an other: thus he did (as it were in ſporte) familiarly wraſtle with Iacob, and continually

both accompany and aſsiſt him: thus he was to Dauid as a Counſeller, to direct him in all his affaires, and thus hee tooke Paul vppe to heauen, and ſhewed him things not to be vttered. But of all other, moſt notable in this reſpect was Abraham, called often in Scripture by the name or rather by the moſt honourable and glorious title of Gods friend, as 2: Chro. 20. 7. Eſ. 41. 8. Iames 2. 23. And in trueth ſo might hee well bee called, for God did both make and keepe with him very ſolemnely, all the lawes of true friendſhip. For firſt hee made a couenant of perpetualloue, with him and with his ſeed for euer, calling Abraham Gods friend. and himſelfe Abrahams God. Secondly, hee did beſtowe vpon him all his bleſsings both temporall and ſpirituall, yea the greateſt honour that could bee, namely to bee as it were the foundation of his Church and choſen people, and the firſt of the progenitours of Chriſt. And laſtly, hee did impart to him his purpoſes and counſels in all things that did any way concerne him, or might make for his good.
                  Yea, wee reade that God was ſo carefull in the performance of this dutie (for ſo it pleaſeth God to binde himſelfe in duties to men) of friendſhippe, that beeing

about to deſtroy thoſe wicked Citties of Sodome and Gomorra, he thought it needfull to impart the matter to his friend Abraham, yea to haue his aſſent for the doing of it. Thus it pleaſeth God of his mercie and goodneſſe to exalt wretched men to this higheſt degree of honour, which indeed is ſo high, as that the Angels in heauen do ſeldome attaine vnto it. So that in this reſpect, and in many other heretofore mentioned, wee may well burſt forth with the Prophet. Pſal. 8. 5. And ſay, what is man that thou that art the great God of heauen and earth ſhuldeſt remember him, or the ſonne of man that thou ſhouldeſt thus viſit him.

                     Gent.
                     I Am thinking with my ſelfe, what facultie there is in the ſoule of man not yet mentioned: for if there bee any, I doubt not (conſidering the great likeneſſe betwixt the ſoule of man & the nature of God, in thoſe faculties common to them both, which you haue already handled) but that it is ether truly belonging to God, or at the leaſt, will giue occaſion to conſider ſomething in his nature. You know that men conceiue things by imagination and retaine them

by memory, are theſe faculties in God? likewiſe, conſcience in man is a diſtinct facultie, or rather an act of the mind, and there are in him diuers affections, as ioy and greefe, and diuers vertues not as yet mentioned, what are we to thinke of theſe things?
                  
                  
                     Sch.
                     I hope you do not looke to heare at this time, whatſoeuer might be ſaid of the nature of God: you are not now ſo deſirous, but if that were taken in hand, you would bee as wearie of hearing, ere it were halfe done: if the cheefe matters be declared, they will giue ſufficient light, whereby the reſt may be perceiued, and ſo by thoſe which haue beene handled, you may eaſely vnderſtand the nature of the reſt of thoſe good affections, and vertuous diſpoſitions, which are in ſcripture attributed to God. So for the eſſentiall faculties of the ſoule, you ſay very truly, that they are moſt like to the diuine nature, and euen a plaine and expreſſe Image of it: yet this difference muſt be noted, that whatſoeuer thing is in them that argueth weakeneſſe or ſuture poſſibilitie, that hath not truly place in the diuine nature, which is a perfect and complete act. As in theſe particulars which you haue named, imagination is but a poſſibilitie or meanes of knowledge, but the knowledge of God hath beene ſaid to bee eternall and actuall.
                     
                        
It is hard, I confeſſe, and euen impoſſible for vs to ſee or imagine how all the particulars in the world ſhould exiſt actually in any vnderſtanding from all eternitie, but wee muſt not meaſure the infinitneſſe of Gods vnderſtanding by our ſhallow braines. But as touching the queſtion which you mooue of imagination and the meanes and manner of knowledge in God, how the ideae or notions of things enter into his mind, or rather how they exiſt eternally in it without any entering in or beginning, firſt it muſt bee helde, that although they exiſt eternally in GOD, yet they are not eſſentiall to him, that is, ſo naturall and neceſſary as that without them he could nor exiſt, as is the knowledge of himſelfe and the idea of his owne nature, yea all the reſt of Gods eſſentiall attributes, of all which if wee ſhould detract but one from God, wee ſhuld quite deſtroy and ouerthrow his whole nature and eſſence.
                     But the knowledge of the creatures is not of that kinde, for God beeing in himſelfe abſolute and all ſufficient, might haue (if it hadde ſo ſeemed good vnto him) exiſted without euer eyther making or knowing any creature, and therefore the

knowledge of them in God, muſt be thought to ariſe not from the abſolute neceſsitie of his nature, but from the free libertie of his will, moouing (yet eternally) his vnderſtanding to this actuall knowledge of the creatures. Yea that as the knowledge oridea of his own nature is (according to y•
                         order of nature, not any difference of time) firſt in the eſſentiall vnderſtanding of God, and then in his will, ſo the knowledge or idea of the creatures hath his beginning not in the vnderſtanding but in the will of God. This difference we haue and ſee more plainely in our ſelues, for as we haue ſome general notions engrauen in our mindes by nature it ſelfe, and ſo in a maner both bred and borne with vs without any helpe of our wils, ſo the knowledge of other things hath the beginning in the will, diſpoſing and inclining the minde to this or that knowledge, as it ſeemeth beſt vnto it. Secondly as touching this (in a manner accidentall) knowledge of God, it muſt bee held that God hath it of himſelfe and not by the means, or from the creatures, as we haue, that by ſence and imagination get the reſemblances of things into our mindes, the which way of knowledge if it were admitted to bee in God, it would follow, that his knowledge of the creature doth not go before, but followeth

after it and ſo is not the cauſe but rather an effect of it, and not eternall but temporall, whereas wee holde that the will and eternall foreknowledge of God are the cauſe of all things.
                  
                  
                     Gent.
                     I haue heard it ſaid, that the diuine nature is as it were a Glaſſe, wherein al things that do at any time exiſt in the world, may be ſeene and knowne, and that by the Saints and Angels in heauen, much more then by God himſelfe, who knoweth all things by his owne eſſence, it being the ſimilitude of all things.
                  
                  
                     Sch.
                     Some haue thought as you ſay, but it is a mere fable to ſay that eyther the Saints or the Angels do or can ſee the eſſence of God, much leſſe all things in it. It is true that God knoweth all things, and that by his eſſence, if thereby we meane his eſſentiall vnderſtanding, and that by the ſimilitude which his eſſentiall vnderſtanding hath to the creatures, if thereby wee meane the ſimilitude which is betwixt the generall idea or notion and the particular inſtance. For as it is eſſentiall and naturall to God to know himſelfe, ſo it is eſſentiall and natural to him to know the generall differences of things, without the knowledge whereof he could not knowe himſelfe. As namely it is eſſentiall to God to know

what is reaſonable, infinit, knowledge, wiſedome, good and eternall, for otherwiſe hee could not know his owne nature, which conſiſtesh in theſe differences. By the ſame meanes alſo hee knoweth what is vnreaſonable, finite, errour, folly, euill and time, which are contrary to the other, for one contrary cannot bee knowne without the knowledge of the other.
                     This is the eſſentiall knowledge engrauen in the very nature of GOD, and as wee ſaye of our naturall notions, both borne and bred with him, but it doth not extend it ſelfe any further or deſcend into particulars: for it is not eſſentiall to GOD, to know Peter, Paule, or any other man, nor yet to know the nature of man, nor yet to knowe this worlde wherein wee liue, for GOD might haue exiſted though none of theſe hadde euer beene. But the knowledge of theſe particulars, is by the free will of GOD deducted from thoſe generall notions, which are eſſentiall to God: who hath thought good to make by the creation a particular inſtance, example, and as it were an experiment of his eſſentiall and vniuerſall knowledge.

that thinke that God knoweth no particulars, becauſe there is no medium, no means or way by the which the ſimilitudes of them ſhould bee carried from the things to the nature of God, for that there muſt be a conuenience betwixt the things knowne and the minde: which is not betwixt the creatures and the vnderſtanding of God.
                  
                  
                     Sch.
                     I am far from that abſurd error, and I hope from any ſuch: I do not doubt but that God knoweth euery particular thing in the world ſeuerally and diſtinctly from all other, yea, that hee hath in his eternall counſell diſtinguiſhed them, as namely men, of whom he hath appointed ſome to glory and others to confuſion: yea, that he knoweth euery particular thing farre more diſtinctly and truly then we do, that ſee and feele them: for hee knoweth them in their cauſes, and eſſentiall formes, the which only is the true knowledge, whereas we do but geſſe at their natures by their qualities and effects.
                  
                  
                     Gent.
                     Yet perhaps you doo thinke that God knoweth the particulars of this world which now exiſteth, more then he doth a 1000. other worlds, which neuer did nor ſhal exiſt indeed, altho they exiſt in the vniuerſal notions of Gods vnderſtanding, and ſo may be as wel knowne to God as this particular world, which is brought forth into act.
                  
                  
                     
                     Sch.
                     We cannot ſay, if we ſpeake properly, that God knoweth any particulars, but thoſe which do ſometime exiſt. He knoweth himſelfe able to make ſuch particulars, if it were his will, but they are not particulars, vntill his will do bring them into act: for as vniuerſall notions are in Gods vnderſtanſtanding as in their firſt fountaine, or rather in their proper place, ſo particulars come from the will of God: And therefore wee muſt needs thinke that God knoweth thoſe particulars which do or ſhal exiſt, or haue exiſted otherwiſe then thoſe which doo neuer exiſt, for hee knoweth the one and not the other.
                  
                  
                     Gent.
                     Let me trouble you once more, and no more, for this is a poynt that I could neuer vnderſtand, to wit how God getteth the knowledge of theſe things: doo you thinke that he knoweth thoſe things which hee hath decreed to exiſt no otherwiſe, when and while they doo exiſt, then he doth before, and after: or that the exiſtance of them maketh ſome kinde of impreſsion, or alteration in his minde, which was not before?
                  
                  
                     Sch.
                     No ſurely, the exiſtence of things doth no way alter or affect God: obiects do worke vpon our ſences and minde, but Gods

vnderſtanding is merely actiue not paſsiue: yet wee cannot doubt, but that as God maketh vs to perceiue things by ſence, and the Angels by ſome other meanes, ſo hee is able by meanes to make himſelfe capable of the qualities of particular obiects, but of himſelfe and in his owne nature, hee is altogither vncapable of them, or of any knowledge by them.
                  
                  
                     Gent.
                     You haue no liſt to anſwere me directly to the queſtion: I do not thinke that God doth ſuffer from the obiects, but that is all one, I would know whether that hee doth not know and ſee vs, as we go here otherwiſe then he did, when we were in the loines of our firſt father Adam, and whether that he doo not plainely ſee vs two particularly and diſtinctly, whether he do it intromittendo, as we doo, or which is more agreeable to his nature being impaſsible) extramittendo, that is not the queſtion: but I cannot be perſwaded but that although hee knoweth vs fully and certainely before we exiſt, yet when once we do exiſt in nature, he then doth ſee & behold vs after an other manner.
                  
                  
                     Sch.
                     You ſay true, I haue no minde to wade farre into this matter, for it is very hard, yea impoſſible for vs to know the manner of the actual knowledge of God: and therfore I did

paſſe it ouer in the proper place, neither wold I haue mentioned it but that you vrge mee ſo hard: for I thinke it ſufficient for vs to know that God knoweth all things, euen the moſt ſecret thoughts of our mindes, although wee be ignorant how he commeth to that knowledge. But for your queſtion I haue told you my opinion, that howſoeuer you ſeeme to thinke that God knoweth things not exiſting and ſeeth thē as it were with eyes, when they do exiſt, yet it ſeemeth more conſonant to the truth to ſay, y•
                         the creatures whither exiſting or deſiſting, are all alike knowne to God, and I pray you reſt in this anſwere, for this time. Now as touching memorie, as God hath no vſe of imagination, becauſe he hath nothing to learne, ſo he hath no need of memorie, for that he cannot looſe any thing by forgetfulneſſe, all things being preſent vnto him both paſt & future. Likewiſe for conſcience, which is the teſtimonie giuen by the minde in the preſence of God of the innocencie and integritie or of the guiltineſſe of this or that reaſonable creature, and ſo eyther of the want or of the deſert of blame, it may in ſome ſort bee attributed to God, and that in reſpect both of himſelfe as alſo of the creature: for firſt, God as he is in all reſpects moſt pure and innocent, yea moſt holy and good, ſo before

himſelfe and in his owne preſence, hee both knoweth and acknowledgeth himſelfe ſo to be, and for that cauſe not onely to be free fiō all deſert of blame, but alſo to deſerue moſt worthely al praiſe and glory. But more plainly this facultie hath vſe in reſpect of men, who do often charge God with euill, iniurie, iniuſtice, crueltie, and many other grecuous crimes, in the which plea this facultie of conſcience doth cleare and abſolue God, from all thoſe blaſphemous reproches which wretched men ſpew out againſt him. Rom. 3. 4. Let God be true and euery man a lyer that thou mayeſt be iuſtified in thy ſayings, and ouercome when thou art iudged. Thus much of the faculties of the minde, which you thought omitted in the former diſcourſe: as for the affections and vertues, as ioy greefe, and diuers other, which in ſcripture ate often attributed to God, their nature may be knowne by thoſe which haue bene handled.
                  
               
            
            
               
               CHAP. VI. Of the externall attributes of God.
               
               
                  THus I haue declared vnto you, thoſe things which for the preſent I could call to my remembrance as touching the nature of God, his exiſtence, eſſence, and attributes, eyther truly taken or typically borrowed from the faculties of a reaſonable ſoule. To the which if you adde the externall attributes which are borrowed from the body or outward perſon of man, as is the eternitie of GOD from the age or continuance of man, his vbiquitie from the greatneſſe or ſtature of man, his omnipotencie from the ſtrength of man, with others of the ſame kinde, you haue a perfect picture of the nature of God ſhadowed out, though rudely and imperfectly, vnder the ſhape of man.
               This laſt kinde of attributes hath beene touched already in ſpeaking of the infinitneſſe of God, the generall and eſſentiall difference

of his nature, from the which they doo neceſſarely flowe, and therefore wee are here to make an ende of this conference: and ſo wee may of our iourney alſo, if you thinke good to light and leade along this long cauſey: it will be a great eaſe both to our ſelues and to our horſes, and wee may (now that wee are in ſight of the Towne) talke of our lodging, for it is meete that wee haue ſome care of our bodyes, that ſo wee may be able afterward to ſerue God by meditation, conference, and ſuch other Chriſtian exerciſes.
               
                  Gent.
                  Nay by your fauour ſir, I muſt needes deſire you to make an ende of the taſke, which vpon agreement, though vnwillingly you tooke in hand: It would bee a great greefe (I will not ſay a ſhame) for a man that hadde toyled all the day long many a long mile through thicke and thin, to giue ouer at the laſt caſt, in the ſight of the place whither hee goeth: if you haue perhappes touched theſe attributes by the way vpon ſome occaſion, it followes not, that they ſhoulde bee denied their proper and due place in this worke, the which without them would bee maimed and imperfect.
                  I like well that we light and leade, for

ſo we ſhal haue the more time for conference but for our lodging wee will not trouble our ſelues as yet, but rather take it as we finde it, and therfore I pray you let mee heare and knowe ſomewhat of theſe alſo in particular, and firſt why you call them externall attributes.
               
               
                  Sch.
                  I hope your meaning is not that we ſhall go reaſoning into the towne, for ſo we ſhould haue moderatours inow to cut vs off: but to ſhut vp theſe things breefely: They are called externall, not as if there were any ſuch difference of externall & internal in god as in man, conſiſting of an outward body and an inward ſoule, for in God there is neither without nor within, but all alike: but they are ſo called in GOD becauſe they are ſo in truth in man from whoſe nature the reſemblance is taken. Yea further they may bee ſo called, howſoeuer they bee as eſſentiall as the other: for that they doo not come ſo immediately from the roote of Gods eſſence, which is an infinit vnderſtanding, neither ſo properly belong to the nature of it, but are as it were, begotten by the coniunction of the difference which is infiniteneſſe to the eſſentiall vnderſtanding of GOD: the which bringeth forth knowledge, wiſedome, will and the

reſt of the aforeſaid attributes, more naturally and properly then it doth eternitie and vbiquitie, the which are found onely in this one vnderſtanding, whereas the other are common to al vnderſtandings, both finite and infinit. And therefore we may truly ſay that the infinit knowledge of God is more inward and neare the vnderſtanding which is the root of Gods eſſence, then is his infinit continuance, although not more eſſentiall: euen as we ſee that thoſe parts of a tree, which are nearer the roote, may be ſaid to be the inner parts, and the ſmal twigs the vtter parts, altho the one bee no more eſſentiall to the tree then the other. Now for the particulars: and to begin with the eternitie of God which is his euerlaſting age or continuance, repreſented to vs, Dan. 7. 9. by an old aged man, whoſe head and haire are as white as ſnow, or ye
                      whiteſt wolle, the which teſtifieth that hee is no babe of yeſterdaies birth, but that he hath liued and continued in the world many yeares: euen ſo it is with god, or rather ſo it is not with god, for the oldeſt man that is had a time of birth and beginning, tho long ſince, and ſhall haue a time of end euen hard at hand but god is without father or mother, and hath neither beginning of dayes nor end of life, but is the ſame this day, yeſterday & for euer. He is not by

the gray or white hayres of olde age ſummoned to the court of death, for he is alwaies in his freſh and flouriſhing youth: his ſubſtance doth not weare and waſte away, for it is not as are the bodyes of men, as a Kingdome deuided in it ſelfe, which therefore cannot ſtand but is ſimple without mixture or diuerſitie, and therefore without iarring, yea all perill and peraduenture of ruine.
                  So then this eternitie of God is to bee defined, the euerlaſting exiſtence of his eſſence without eyther beginning or end. For if it had beginning, then it did not alwaies exiſt, for it could not exiſt before it hadde a beginning: And if it did not alwayes exiſt, then ſometime there was nothing, but that cannot bee, for if there were time, there was diſtinction of motion which made that time, but where there is nothing, there is no motion, for nothing cannot mooue.
                  Beſides, if the time euer were, wherein there was no thing nor nature exiſting (for if God were not exiſting there was nothing, for whatſoeuer did then exiſt was god, becauſe it did primarely exiſt) nothing ſhould euer haue exiſted: for if the Philoſopher could not ſee how the moſt mightie and omnipotent

God could make ye
                      firſt matter of the world, for that hee had nothing whereof to make it, and iuſt nothing ſaith hee, (though falſely) is made of nothing, what would hee ſay to this paradoxe, that nothing did of nothing make ſomething, yea all things, not onely materiall bodies, but euen the moſt pure and operatiue formes? But wee knowe that God is eternall, that is, hee euer was, and neuer was not, hee was not made by nothing, for nothing makes nothing, nor by any thing, for that which could make God, was before god and greater then God, and therefore onely God: but God made himſelfe, not by giuing or rather by taking a beginning to himſelfe, but by being himſelfe, as he doth ſtill, and ſhall for euer make himſelfe. Hee was alwaies, as hee will bee euermore, neuer beginning, nor euer ending, but alwaies being. Hee exiſteth not of nothing, but of himſelfe, not by another, but by himſelfe, in no other but in himſelfe, and for no other but for himſelfe, and ſo hee is to himſelfe all in all. Yea as God is eternall, ſo euerie eternall is God, for no creature can bee eternall, becauſe with the creature there comes in generation and motion, & with motion time, and ſo eternitie is abandoned: for time and eternitie are contraries, as are finite and infinite,
.

the meaſure and that which is vnmeaſurable. But (you may ſay) how could God exiſt without the creature, for how could hee exiſt without working and doing ſomething, he being a moſt actuall and operatiue forme, and how could hee worke, if hee had no matter to worke on? how could God extend his goodneſſe, there beeing nothing to receiue it, or how could hee haue glorie and honour, there beeing none to giue it, for honour is in the giuer, not in the taker? or what diſparagement would it haue beene to God, if hee had made the creature to exiſt from all eternitie, more then it is that hee will make it to exiſte to all eternitie, as wee knowe that hee hath promiſed in holy ſcripture? yes ſurely, God is not pind vpon the ſleeue of the creature, that hee could not exiſt and that in perfect happineſſe and glorie, without the helpe or company of any creature, the which howſoeuer it do ſet foorth the glorie of God after another manner, then that wherby God was glorious in and to himſelfe ftom all eternitie, yet it addeth nothing to the perfection of Gods glorie, which before was abſolute, although not in the ſame manner. Neyther can wee doubt but that this eternitie of the creature would bee a great blot to the glory of God, wherof his eternitie is now a notable

part, but ſhould not bee if that the creature were eternall as well as God. And therefore it muſt bee content to bee a degree beneath him, rather then to ſtriue in vaine to fetch the pedigree from ſo auncient a ſtocke: eternitie muſt be left to God as a royall prerogatiue proper to his houſe and crowne, for the antiquitie of a fewe thouſand yeares may ſerue to make ye
                      creature noble. Now that obiectiō which ſaith, that God could not exiſt without the creatures, becauſe without thē he could not worke, is eaſely anſwered: for before the creation, God did no way mooue or worke: yet he was not idle, for hee did as hee doth ſtill, giue himſelfe to the contemplation of himſelf, euen of his own infinit eſſence and glorie.
               
               
                  
                     Sect. 4.
                  NExt to the eternitie of GOD, commeth to bee conſidered his vbiquitie which concerneth the ſtature and greatneſſe of GOD, as the other did his age and continuance. For as in time, ſo alſo in greatneſſe God muſt bee knowne and acknowledged to bee infinite, not incloſed or comprehended within any creature or place eyther in heauen or in earth, but ſilling all creatures, and all places both in heauen and earth,

yea ſtretching and extending himſelfe beyond the compaſſe of the world by infinite degrees, and that not onely by his power (his eſſence beeing in ſome ſet particular place) as wee knowe that Princes ſitting and being contained in a little chaire, ſtretch their power & authoritie ouer whole countries and kingdomes farre diſtant from them: but it is not ſo with God, who as in power, ſo alſo in his ſubſtance and eſſence is euery where, in al things and in all places, for hee is not by any thing either kept or put and as it were iuſled out and diſpoſſeſſed of his place, but is in all places euen where the groſſeſt bodies are, as well as where is neyther place nor bodie. We ſee how the ayre (to the which wee haue before compared the vbiquitie of God) is deſirous to inlarge his dominions, and therefore aſſoone as euer it findeth any place emptie, it ſtraightway taketh poſſeſsion: but if there be any bodie in it to keepe poſſeſsion, it is kept out a doores, and can haue no title to it: and ſo in all other bodies wee ſee that the weaker giueth place to the ſtronger, for it is impoſsible that two bodies ſhould bee togither in one place. But it is not ſo with God, for no creature is able to put him out of any place: hee doth ſuffer the creatures to haue their ſeuerall places, but not to vſurpe his place, the

which is euery place, as well where the creatures are, as where nothing is. For their being in place doth not hinder him from being there, for he is there as well as they, and euen where they are. Hee is where the earth is, for hee is in the earth, and both heauen and earth are in him, and ſubſiſt in him as in their ſubiect and foundation, vpholding and containing them. And therefore his title is better to that place which they haue, then is theirs, for hee was there in peaceable poſſeſſion of it, before they were any where exiſting, and ſo he will bee there when they are conſumed to aſhes and gone.
                  
                     Gent.
                     I do eaſely beleeue that God is euery where, and that his exceeding greatneſſe is more then ſufficient to fill a thouſande worlds: but I pray you ſhewe mee how God is preſent euery where, whither he bee partly in one place, and partly in another, or rather as I haue heard them ſay, wholly in euery place, as it is ſaid of the ſoule, that it is tota in toto corpore, and tota in qualibet parte, wholly both in the whole bodie, and alſo in euery part or member of it.
                  
                  
                     Sch.
                     That is indeed the vſuall ſaying and ſimilitude, according to the which god is to bee thought to be wholly in euery Church & houſe, yea in the leaſt thing that is, as well as

in the greateſt. It is ſure, that the eſſence of God is moſt ſimple and vniforme without any diſtinction of partes, but the very ſame euery where: yet that common ſaying is hard to bee vnderſtood, and therefore may eaſely by the ſimple bee peruerted to their own deſtruction: who hearing God to bee wholly in euery place, will readely ſuppoſe him to bee contained in that place, and ſo to bee finite, yea to bee diuided into infinit Gods, as the Heathen imagined euery houſe and perſon to haue his proper god attending on him. And therefore wee may more 
                           •
                        aſely and truely imagine God to bee one whole vndiuided and vniforme eſſence, containing and incloſing in it ſelfe all bodies as doth the ayre, yet not excluded out of any place where any body is, as the ayre is out of all ſuch places, and that God is not in this or that place, Church, or houſe, but that all places, houſes, churches, yea the earth, ayre, & heauē it ſelfare in God, & that in quantitie euen as a pins poynt is in reſpect of the whole compaſſe of heauen, and that in him the whole world mooueth and hath his beeing. Yea, his eſſence extendeth it ſelfe infinitly without the compaſſe of the world, and aboue the higheſt heauens, and ſo is to

bee thought to bee totally or wholly in any one place, and that equally, as much in one place as in another.
                  
                  
                     Gent.
                     I pray you ſhewe mee that, for I haue alwaies thought God to be after a ſpeciall manner there, where hee profeſſed himſelfe to bee, as namely to bee preſent with the Arke and the propitiatorie ſeate, more then in the Idoles of the heathen, in the temple of Ieruſalem, more then in any other: ſo likewiſe to bee in the godly more then in the wicked, in heauen, the which the ſcripture doth vſually make the place of Gods dwelling and reſidencie, more then in hell, or on the earth: and moſt of all, to bee in the humanitie of Chriſt, wherein the Apoſtle ſaith. Col. 2. 9. That the fulneſſe of the Godhead doth dwell bode

                     Sch.
                     If you thinke the eſſence of God to be in any one place more then in another, you are greatly deceiued: it is euery where alike, neither can it poſsibly bee otherwiſe, for it cannot be gathered or compacted togither into any other forme, then is that infinite greatneſſe, which filleth all places,
                     God may indeede ſhewe his preſence by outwarde actions, more in one place then in another, and ſo ſaye and

profeſſe himſelfe to bee there onely, and no where elſe, ſpeaking according to the erroneous conceit of men, that thinke him to be no where preſent in eſſence, but where he ſheweth himſelfe and his power by ſome outward ſigne. Thus God was preſent in the Temple of Ieruſalem, and more ſpecially in the holy of holieſt, and in the propitiatorie ſeate more then in other places, not by his eſſence but by his mercie and goodneſſe, the which hee did there reueale and ſhew to the Iewes more then to any other people. Thus God is preſent in his ſpirit in the faithfull, more then in the carnall man, not by the eſſence, but by the effectuall operation of it, reneuing in thē his owne image of holineſſe and trueth, the which thing hee doth not in the other. Thus God is preſent in heauen more then in hell or heere on earth not in eſſence, but in glorie and maieſtie, the which ſhineth more in heauen, then any where elſe. For euen as a man hauing been kept all his life in a darke dungeon from the light of the ſunne, and the ſight of the creatures in the world, if he were on a ſuddaine brought vppe into the open ayre, and ſuffered to behold all theſe glorious creatures, would not ſticke to ſay and affirme, this world to bee the very dwelling place and pallace of God: ſo doth

heauen ſeeme in reſpect of this inferiour world wherein wee liue. But the greateſt doubt is of the humanitie of Chriſt, with the which (without doubt) the Godheade is preſent farre otherwiſe, yea farre more excellently then euer it was with any creature, or in any place eyther in heauen or earth: yea ſo, that if it were poſsible for the diuine eſſēce to be in any one thing or place more thē in another, it would without queſtion bee more in the humanitie of Chriſt, then euer it was any where. For God did neuer before vouchſafe ſuch vnſpeakeable honour to any creature, as to take it into his own perſon and to himſelfe, yea to bee himſelfe. Yet for all this, the eſſence of God is no more in the humanitie of Chriſt, then in other places and creatures, and yet it is ioyned, yea vnited to it, ſo as it neuer was to any creature.
                  
                  
                     Gent.
                     How is that ſtraunge coniunction of the humanitie of Chriſt to the diuine eſſence?
                  
                  
                     Sch.
                     For that I muſt craue pardon of you, it is not ſo ſoone done as deſired: it is well if I can get done the taſke which you exact of mee, thogh I do not meddle with other matters, eſpecially with ſuch as being very hard and intricate, require ſeuerall and large treatreatiſes:

it is better that wee hold our ſelues to the matter in hande, and ſo ſeeing in part the trueth of this poynt, to proceede to the reſt of the externall attributes of god, as namely to the omnipotencie of God.

                     I did not thinke it to haue beene a matter requiring either long time, or any greate labour, and then I am ſure you would not haue ſtucke with me, but I pray you hold on your courſe, ſeeing you will not bee intreated to digreſſe.

                     The omnipotencie of God is reſembled in man by the ſtrength of his bodie, or the power of his perſon, yet there is as great difference, as is betwixt the age of man and the eternitie of God, or the ſtature of man, and the incomprehenſible greatneſſe of god. For as God is, ſo is his power, by the which hee is able and ſufficient to doo whatſoeuer pleaſeth him, as it is defined Pſal. 135. 6. The Lord is great aboue all Gods, and hath done whatſoeuer hee woulde in heauen and in the earth, in the ſea and in the deeps: & what neede there to bee more power then will, or to what purpoſe is that power, which is without the will. So that the obiect of Gods power,

is the whole world, in the which, and ouer the which, God hath ſo ample and abſolute authoritie, that neither the greatneſſe, ſtrength, nor multitude of the creatur is able to reſiſt his wil and power, who is able (if hee were willing) to turne all things vpſide down, to make the heauen & the earth change places the one with the other, ſo that the heauen ſhould reſt in the middeſt, & the earth turne about in the circle.
                     Yea as hee made both heauen and earth, and all things in them contained of nothing, ſo hee is able to turne them all to nothing, and that without any labour or difficultie, euen by the breath of his mouth, and the meer inclination of his will.
                     But howſoeuer this power of God cannot bee matched by any creature, yet it doth both match and ouermatch it ſelfe, reſtraining it ſelfe ſo, that it is not able to doo any thing againſt it ſelfe, for that which God by his power doth at any time, hee cannot by his power make it to be not done or vndone at the ſame time, for ſo the power of God ſhould bee contrarie to it ſelfe. And therefore if God by his power make the ſunne to ſhine at any time, hee cannot by his power make that it ſhall not ſhine at the very ſame time.
                     
                        
If he make mā free, he cānot make him boūd, if hee giue him will, he cannot compell him to be willing, for ſo hee ſhould not giue, but take away will from him: and ſo in all other inſtances, it is impoſsible to God to make contradictories to bee true, becauſe he being perfect vnitie, cannot bee contrarie to himſelfe. And if God cannot make any repugnancie in the nature of the creatures, much leſſe can hee doo it in his owne nature, and therfore he cannot do any thing cōtrarie vnto it, as namely to iuſtifie a wicked man, or to condemne the righteous, to loue one that is ſinfull, or to hate him that is indued with his owne image of holineſſe, to diminiſh, deſtroy, or any way to alter himſelf, who is vnchangeable. Theſe things God cannot do, beeing hindered not by any creature but by himſelf, and therefore the impoſsibilitie of dooing them, is not to bee accounted weakneſſe or impotencie, but ſtrength and power: otherwiſe nothing is impoſsible to bee done by God, that can poſsibly be imagined by man. How then can we ſufficiently wonder at the groſſe errour and ſottiſh ignorance of thoſe men, who in reſpect of the difficultie or rather impoſsibilitie (as they thinke) of performing them, call into queſtion the trueth of thoſe promiſes which God hath made to his

Church of the reſurection of the bodie, although conſumed to nothing, and of eternall glorie. But as they erre, not knowing the ſcriptures nor the power of God, ſo we ſeeing theſe things to bee moſt eaſie to God, are to bee confirmed in faith and in the reſolute perſwaſion of the trueth of them.
                  
                  
                     Gent.
                     I am I thanke God fully perſwaded, that God both can eaſely, and will vndoubttedly reſtore vs to life, though we were conſumed to nothing, by burning a thouſande yeares in the hoteſt fire that can bee made or imagined. Yet I pray you tell me one thing, doo you thinke it poſsible that the very ſame indiuiduum, and as you ſay in the Schooles, idem numero, hauing beene conſumed to nothing, can bee reſtored, as namely the ſame candle after that it is conſumed?
                  
                  
                     Sch.
                     I perceiue you meaning: it is certaine that God both can and will raiſe vs to life againe, not in any other, but in theſe very ſame perſons, which now we are: but what the Schoolemen meane by that quidditie of idem numero, & many other of the ſame kind, as I neuer did, ſo I do not now mean to trouble my ſelfe with them.
                  
               
               
                  
                  
                     Sect. 4.
                  WEe will rather come to the reſt of theſe external attributes, the which (as I am of my ſelfe not vnwilling) ſo you ſee that we muſt of neceſsitie knit vp in very fewe words. Firſt for the ſimilitude of the diuine eſſence, the which muſt be graunted to bee a moſt ſimple and pure forme, altogither voyde not onely of all mixſture of diuers matters or contrarie qualities, as wee knowe the elements to bee, but euen of all manner of compoſition whatſoeuer, euen of that which is the ſimpleſt, to wit, of matter and forme, whereof all creatures do neceſſarely ſubſiſt, for that neyther matter nor form can in them exiſt the one without the other. But there can no kinde of matter bee admitted into the diuine eſſence, no not that wherof as being moſt pure, ſubtile and ſimple, the heauens, or the Angelles themſelues (more ſubtile then the heauens, if more may bee) do conſiſt. For ſo wee ſhould pull downe all that wee haue built vp, and gaineſay all that hath hithertoo beene affirmed of the nature of God. For we cannot make him both eternall, and alſo compounded of matter and forme, for in compoſition there is motion, & in motion time, and time taketh away eternitie, yea wee muſt graunt the matter wherof

hee is compounded, to haue beene before him, the which muſt ſubſiſt in ſimple, before it bee brought into compoſition. Againe if hee bee materiall, he is locall, for all matter is in place, and ſo hee is not infinite, but finite and circumſcribed. Yea thus wee ſhall take from him his omnipotencie, which ariſeth of the puritie of his ſimple forme beeing mere actuall, becauſe it is inmateriall, whereas if it were compounded of matter and forme, it ſhould be compounded of impotencie and of power, of paſsion as well as of action, for it muſt participate the nature of both the parents, taking from the one operatiue power, and from the other paſsible impotencie, and ſo bee not a pure act, but clogged and blunted with the groſſeneſſe of matter, and by it made vnable to worke, yea as like and readie to ſuffer it ſelfe, as to worke in others. And therefore in the building of this pallace for the great God of heauen, wee muſt reiect all corruptible matter, yea all matter whatſoeuer, becauſe al matter is corruptible, and ſo make the diuine nature to bee a pure forme, wholly actiue and in no reſpect or part paſſiue.

                     I haue ofte heard men ſpeak, & haue red mens writings of theſe pure abſtract formes, of the which kind many do hold not only god, but euē the angels, which are meer creatures to bee: yet it cou

                        d neuer ſinke

into my head, how a forme ſhould ſubſiſt of it ſelfe without ſome matter to vphold it: and as I remember, you ſaid before, that ſome ancient diuines (I thinke you named Tertullian) were of the ſame opinion, or rather dulneſſe of conceit, and did therefore allowe bodies wherein to ſubſiſt, not onely to the Angels, but euen to God himſelfe.
                  
                  
                     Sch.
                     It is ha
                           •
                        d for vs, who conſiſting of groſſe bodies and braines, eſteeme other natures by our own, to imagine how any forme ſhould ſubſiſt without ſome materiall ſubiect to vphold it. As touching the Angels, if you cannot thinke, or will not beleeue them to be pure and abſtract formes, altogither voyde of materiall compoſition, you ſhall (for mee) continue in your error or opinion: but if you will not admit God to ſubſiſt in this manner, to wit, as a ſubſtantial forme vpholding both it ſelfe, and alſo all things whatſoeuer do any way exiſt, you will marre all. Neyther ought the difficultie of ſuppoſing it, breede in vs any doubting of the trueth of it, it hauing beene often alreadie ſaide, that the maner of Gods ſubſiſting in his eſſentiall forme, is altogither vnſearchable and incomprehenſible. Let it bee ſufficient that wee haue it prooued by moſt neceſſarie demonſtrations, that God is a moſt

pure, ſubſtantiall, immateriall & actiue forme without any cōpoſition of matter & form or diſtinction of parts, but euery where alike and the very ſame. Yea I do not ſee but that this praerogatiue of being a mere and pure forme muſt be reſerued to God, and in no caſe cō
                        municated to any creature as the groſſeneſſe of matter muſt be left to the creature and in no wiſe aſcribed to God. And ſo matter, or materiall ſubſiſting (the which bringeth with it motion and time, paſſion, alteration, limitation and impotencie) ſhall bee the badge or cognizance, which the creature ſhall weare that ſo it may appeare, that he is not his owne man, or maker, but that he ſerueth and depē
                        deth on an other, by whom he was made and is maintained. And on the other ſide, mere ſimplicitie and pure formalitie (to the which eternitie, reſt, identitie, operation, infinitneſſe and omnipotencie are annexed) is to bee accounted the royall diademe, which aduanceth God in his Throne of glory aboue all creatures whatſoeuer. With this ſimplicitie of the diuine eſſence we may ioyne the vnitie of it, for as it is ſimple without partes, ſo it is one without kindes, neither can we imagin it to be moe then one for many cauſes. For if we ſuppoſe two infinits, wee make no inſinit, for each of the two is the limit of the other, for it

keepeth the other from comming into it ſelfe (otherwiſe it becommeth one with it, and is no longer two but onely one) and ſo from extending it ſelfe into infinite. Beſides, wee know that the diuine eſſence beeing the firſt fountaine from the which all things flowe, and the laſt end to the which they tend, muſt bee the abſolute perfection of reſt altogither voyd of motion: for otherwiſe things ſhould moue not to reſt but to motion, and the termini à quo and ad quem, ſhould be not fixt, but moueable, and ſo vncertaine: but if the diuine eſſence bee many or moe then one, there is not abſolute perfection, which is onely in vnitie as motion is in number.
                     So that as it is in ciuil ſtates, the which are neuer counted ſure and ſetled in the abſolute perfection of gouernment, till the whole authoritie be deuolued from the people to many, from many to a fewe, from a few to one, becauſe where there are moe then one in autho

                        itie, there is matter of continuall diſcord and diſorder, but in vnitie there is perfect concord, for no man diſagreeth with himſelfe: ſo much more we are to thinke that the ſoueraigne Monarchie of the world is not in motion or poſſibilitie tending to perfection, but already and euen for euer eſtabliſhed in perfect vnitie:

but we neede not inſiſt any longer in proouing the vnitie of the god-head, which of it ſelfe is manifeſt, and therefore we will now ſhut vp this conference, with the laſt of theſe external attributes, which is the immoueabilitie, if we may ſo ſpeake, of God.
                  
               
               
                  
                     Sect. 5.
                  THis attribute giueth vs to vnderſtand, that god is not ſubiect to motiō, which is the mutation of ſtate or place, but is in all reſpects immutable and immoueable: he doth not ſhift his dwelling place, wandring vp and downe like a Pilgrime, this day in one countrey and to morrow in an oother, at one time in heauen, and at an other time on earth, but continueth where hee is and where hee hath bene alwaies, more firme and ſteadfaſt then the hugeſt mountaine, or the whole earth, like to a Rocke in the ſea, againſt the which though the waues do beate, and ſo breake themſelues, yet they cannot either moue it in or remoue it out of the place where it is: euen ſo it is with the creatures in the world, the which doo continually toſſe and tumble themſelues from one eſtate to an other, but the Lord remaineth the ſame for euer.
                  
                     
For why, as we our ſelues muſt not ſit downe, but go on till we come to the end of our iourney, euen ſo the creatures, when they are in their beſt eſtate, are not there to reſt in thē
                     ſelues, as if they had made themſelues for themſelues, but they muſt moue and go on towards God and his glory by performing thoſe duties, which do naturally belong vnto them, and ſo continually better their eſtate. But it is not ſo with God, whoſe perfection is and euer was in complete act, not in hope & poſſibilitie, and therefore hauing all the perfection, that he can haue, he need not ſtir for the obtaining of any more, or mooue for any mans pleaſure: his laſt ende and cheefe good is in himſelfe, and in no other thing whatſoeuer, and therefore hee need not by motion purſue that, which he enioyeth already in reſt, or ſeeke that from an other which he hath in himſelfe. Yea it is needefull that God ſhould be immoueable, hee beeing the foundation, whereon all things whatſoeuer do any way exiſt, do ſtand and rely: ſo that if it did moue and were fickle and wauering, there muſt neceſſarely enſue vniuerſall confuſion & diſorder in nature: in the which reſpect (as was noted in the former attribute) God being both terminus a quo, and terminus ad quem, all naturall motion motion is made,

muſt needs be ſuppoſed to bee vnmoueable. for otherwiſe both diſorder would enſue, and alſo motion ſhould be made to motion, as it were in an endleſſe iourney, and with booteleſſe labour.
                  Laſtly how ſhould wee suppoſe God to moue, whom we know to haue no place whither to moue: for hee himſelfe is euery where and therefore whither ſoeuer he moueth, hee moueth to himſelfe, or rather he moueth not at all, becauſe he is ſtill where he was, euen in himſelfe. Now ſir, I haue as I could, endeauoured to ſatiſfie your requeſt, neither can you require any more of me, ſaue only thanks for your gentleneſſe and curteſie in attending ſo patiently theſe ſimple and rude diſcourſes: your wiſedome is ſuch, that I am perſwaded, you did not expect any perfect declaration of the nature of God, eſpecially at my hands, and at this time: in the which reſpect I hope that you will take in good part, that which hath bene ſaid, how rudely and rawly ſoeuer.
                  
                     Gent.
                     If I ſhould tell you how much I thinke my ſelfe beholden to you for this days worke, you would thinke that I did but flatter you: I know not when I learned ſo much good diuinitie in one day, but I hope to haue ere we part, better occaſion and cauſe too of thanking

you.

                     Well I would giue any good I might haue had your company vp to London: I would thinke to bee by your meanes a good diuine ere I came thither.

                     So you are already, otherwiſe it were ſtrange, that I ſhould make you a good diuine in halfe a ſcore of dayes, that could not make my ſelfe one in a whole ſcore of yeares: but to deale plainely with you, my purpoſe is to trauell as farre as London, though I tolde you not ſo much at firſt: but I doubt that my litle weak nag wil not hold out, and I am ſure, that hee cannot hold foote with your ſtrong gelding.
                  
                  
                     Gent.
                     I am right glad of it, take no thought for your nagge, I will aſſure him to London for the paines that you haue already taken in inſtructing mee: and when wee come to our iournies ende, if I might entreate you to go with mee to my houſe, which is not farre off, you ſhould be as weleome as your ſeife could wiſh, and command any thing I haue.

                     No doubt ſir, but that we may in many places here in New-castle bee both heartely welcome, and honeſtly vſed for our money: but you know that the countrey is plaine and rude, and therefore your entertainment will bee but courſe and homely in reſpect of that curious ciuilitie that is beſouth: yet their meaning is good and better then it ſeemeth.
