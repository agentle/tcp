how great is the puritie which thou teachest? how strict is the account which thou exactest? & with howe seuere iudgement doost thou discusse and examine all thinges? How great shal the shame be wherwith wretched sinners shall in tha

                place be stained? when as all theyr iniquities which when they lyued, they hid vnder the couerts and walls of theyr houses: what soeuer also dishonest, what-soeuer filthy thing they haue committed frō theyr tender yeeres to the terme of their life, all the angles of their harts, & what

                eyes of the whole world. Who there shal haue a conscience so cleere, who when these thinges shall beginne to be done, shall not presently change his colour, and tremble in all his members?
            For if a man doe so much blush, when hee reuealeth his defects in priuate, to some friende of his, so that some one in the very confession waxeth dumbe, and concealeth his crime: what shame shal that be, where-with sinners shall be affected

in the sight of Almighty GOD, and of all ages, past, present, and to come? So great shall that shame be, that the wicked, as the prophet witnesseth, shall cry out,
                  Esay. 10. saying to the mountaines, couer vs, & to hils fall vpon vs.
            But these thinges are tollerable: but what shall become of them when as the sharpe arrowes of that finall sentence from Gods mouth,
                  How horrible the sentence of the Iudg

                  •
               ners be discrutiate, when they heare this sentence? When as wee can scarcely heare a little droppe of his wordes (sayth Iob) who can beholde the thunder of his greatnes?
                  Iob. 16, This voyce shal be so dreadfull, and of such vertue, that the earth in the twinckling of an eye shall bee opened, and in a moment they shall descend to hell (as the sayd Iob saith) who now enioy the timbrel & harp,
                  Iob. 21. and reioyce at the sound of the organ, vvho nowe leade theyr dayes in pleasure.
            
               This case describeth blessed Saint Iohn in his Apocalips, in these wordes; After this I saw another Angel descending from heauen, hauing great power, & the earth was lightned by his glory; and he cryed out in his strength, saying: Great Babilon is fallen, is fallen, and is made the habitation of deuils, and the prison of all vncleane spirits, & the habitation of each vncleane & odible bird. A little after, the same Euangelist addeth, saying; The strong Angel tooke vp a stone, as if it were a great Milstone, and cast it into the sea, and said: with this force shal the great citty Babilon be cast down▪ & henceforward it shall no more bee found.
            After this manner shal the wicked fall into this headlong hell, and into that darksom prison ful of al confusion, which is vnderstood of Babilon in this place. But what tunge can expresse the multitude of punishments which they shall there suffer? There shal their bodies burne in liuing & vnquenchable flames, there their soules without intermission, shalbe gnawed vpon by the worme

of conscience, which shal giue them no truce; There shall be perpetuall weeping of eyes, and gnashing of teeth that shal neuer end, which the sacred Scriptures do so often threaten & repeat. In this place of desperation, those miserable damned, enraged with a certaine cruel madnes, shal cōuert their anger against god, & tyrannize against themselues, eating their owne flesh, renting theyr bowels with furious grones,
                  The blasphemies of the damned.

There each of thē shall curse his vnfortunate chaunce, & vnhappy natiuity, repeating without intermission that doleful plaint, and those desolate and lamentable songs of Iob; Curst bee the day in which I was borne, and the night in which it is said,

               es? where your delights? where are your reioycings? The 7. yeeres of plentie are past, and the 7. yeeres of dearth are come, which haue deuoured all their aboundance. There is no memory left of them, nor appearance: Your glory is foredone; your felicities drowned in the sea of sorrow: your thirst is grown to that drith, that there is not one

            Your felicities which you inioyed in this world, will not onelie not profit you; but euen they will bee the causes to you of greater tormēt. For thē shall be fulfilled that which

is written in the booke of Iob. Let mercy forget him, wormes are his sweetnesse.
                  Iob. 24. Let him not bee in remembrance, but cut downe like an vnfruitfull blocke. But then the sweetnesse of the delight of euils, is turned into the worme of greefe, when as the remembrance of fore-passed pleasures, (according to the exposition of Saint Gregory) shall beget a greater bitternes of pres

            Then at length, (but too late) shall they acknowledge the fallacies of the deuill: & placed in the midst of errours, shal begin (but in vaine) to speake the wordes of the Wiseman, saying; VVe haue wandered from the way of truth,
                  Wisd. 5. and the light of iustice hath not shined vpon vs, & the sunne of vnderstanding is not risen vnto vs: wee are wearied in the way of iniquity & perdition, & haue walked difficult wayes, but the way of our Lord haue we not knowne.

                  •
               here is no tract to be found, neither the way of the keele thereof in the floods. Such like wordes haue the sinners spoken in hell, because the vngodly mans hope is like the light feather, which is lifted vppe by the wind, and like the light froth of the Sea, which is dispersed by the sunne: and as it were smoake scattered by the wind▪ and like the memory of a one dayes guest passing by. These shall be the complaints, these the lamentations, this the perpetuall penance, which the damned shal there performe world without end, where it shall profit them nothing; because the time was ouer-past wherein they should shew fruites worthy of repentance.

               ¶ They who haue loued God with all their harts, shall receaue their remuneration in heauen, namely the glory of eternall beatitude: which in respect of the accidents, in some it shall be greater, in some other lesser; yet is the essentiall reward one, and common to all the elect.

For there shall be perfect charity, and God shall be all in all. For that cause it shall be the common exercise of all, to loue and praise God without end or intermission.

            Would to God the pardon of my finnes were graunted mee, and that presently laying aside this burthen of my flesh, I might enter into the true rest of thy ioyes, and that possessing the most beautifull & admirable walls of thy citty, I might receiue the crowne of life from the handes of our Lorde, that I might accompany these holy quires, that with those blessed spirits I might asist the glory of the Creator, that face to face I might behold Christ, that I might alwayes looke vppon that high, ineffable, and vncircumscribed light.
            Happy is that soule, which deliuered frō this earthly body, may freely ascend to heauen, that secure and peaceable, neither feareth the deuil nor death. Happy & eternally happie my soule, if after this corporall

death, it may be counted worthy to behold thy glory, thy maiesty, thy beautie, thy gates, walls, & streetes, thy many mansions, thy noble cittizens, and thy most mightie kingdome in thy comlines.
            For thy vvalls are of precious stone, and thy gates of the purest Margarites, thy streetes are of burnisht golde, wherein without intermission Alleluia is sunge, thy mansions are many, founded on squared stones, builded with Saphires, & couered with golden tile, into which no man entreth except he be cleane, wherein no one inhabiteth that is defiled.
            Mother Ierusalem, thou art made faire and sweet in thy delights, there is no such thing in thee as we suffer heere, and behold in this miserable life. They differ very far from those thinges which are daily present before our eyes in this life full of calamitie. There is no darknes in thee, neither night, or any change of time. The light of the candle shyneth not in thee, or the bright Moone, or the beamy starres; but God of gods, the light of lights, the

sunne of iustice alwaies illuminateth thee. The white and immaculate Lambe, is thy cleere & delightfull light. The King of Kings, is in the midst of thee, & his children round about him. There the quires of hymne-tuning Angels, there the societie of the supernall Cittizens, there the sweete solemnitie of all those that returne from this wofull pilgrimage vnto thy ioyes. There the prouident company of the prophets, there the twelue number of the Apostles; There the victorious host of innumerable Martyrs; there the sacred couent of the saints Confessors; there the true and perfect Monks, there the holy women, that haue ouercome the pleasures of the world, and the infirmities of theyr sexe. There the young men & maidens, that flying the snares of thys world with sacred manners, haue past theyr time in all vertues; there are the sheepe and lambes, which haue already escaped the snares and pleasures of thys life: All reioyce in theyr peculier mansions. The glory of euery one is different, yet is the ioy of them all common.
            
               Full and perfect charitie raigneth there, because God is there all in all, whom they beholde without ende, and seeing him alwaies, burne in his loue, loue & laude him. They praise and loue; All theyr labour is the prayse of God wi
                  •

Happie were I, and truly happy for euerlasting, if after the resolution of thys body of mine, I shall deserue to hear those canticles of celestiall melody, which are sung in praise of the eternall King, by those cittizens of the celestiall country, & troopes of blessed spirits. Fortunate were I, and incredibly blessed, if I likewise might deserue to sing them, and assist my King, my God, my guide, and see him in his glory, euen as hee hath dayned to promise, saying; Father I will that those whō thou hast giuen me, be with me, that they may beholde my beauty and maiestie, which I had with thee before the beginning of the world.
            Tell me I pray thee brother, what a day shal that be, which shal knock at thy gate, the course of this thy pilgrimage beeing ended, that (if

thou hast liued in the feare of God) may from death transferre thee to immortality? wherein others were wont to feare, thou shalt beginne to lyft vp thy heade, because thy r

            Come out (I pray thee) a little while, (sayth S. Ierosme writing to Eustochia the Virgine) frō the prison, and depaint before thine eyes, the rich reward of thy present labor, which neyther eye hath seene, nor eare heard, neyther hath the hart of man conceiued the like. VVhat day shall that be, when as the Virgine Mary shall meete thee, attended by all the troopes of Virgins, who on the otherside of the Redde-sea, the host of Pharao being drowned, who bearing a tymbrel, shal sing to those that aunswere; Let vs sing to our Lord, for he hath gloriously honored vs, he hath cast down the horse and the ryder into the sea.

               Heere was it lawfull for the blessed Father Ierosme, to sursease his watchings and strokes, with which he wearied his breast during his praiers day and night, whilst with earnest endeuour, and vndaunted mind, he resisted the importunat temptations of sathan. Heere shall the blessed soules feele no more the dreadfull armes of the bloody enemy: Heere shall be no place for the subtilty of that winding serpent: hether pierceth not the eye of that venomous Cockatrice, neyther is the hisse of that auncient serpent heard; But the gentle breath of the holy spirit ouer-breatheth this Region, and the glorie of God illuminateth this place? This is the Region of peace and security placed aboue al the Elements, whether neither foggs nor immeasurable tempests attaine. Glorious things are spoken of thee thou Cittie of God: Blessed are all those (sayth Toby) who loue thee, and who reioyce in thy peace. My soule, blesse our Lord, because hee hath deliuered his Citty of Ierusalem. I shal be blessed if there remaine some reliques of my seed, to see the beauty

of Ierusalem. The gates of Ierusalem are builded of Saphires & Smaragdes, and all the circuites thereof are of precious stone: Of white and pure stone are all the streetes thereof; And thorough the wayes thereof Alleluiah shall be sung. O pleasant country, ô sweet glory, ô blessed society, what wil they doe so happy, that they may enioy thee as elect. It seemeth to be a presumption if any man desire thee, yet without thy desire no man can liue: O you sons of Adam, ô you blind and miserable posterity, fearefull and lost sheepe: if this be your pasture whether wend you? what doe you? why refuse you so great good, for so little labour? Heare what Saint Augustine saith; O my soule (saith he) if wee should euery day suffer torments, if endure hell it selfe for a long time, that we might see Christ in his glorie, and accompany his Saints, were it not a thing woorthy to suffer all what so euer intollerable, that wee might be made pertakers of so much good, & so much glory? Let therefore the deuills assault and prepare their temptations; let fasts mortifie

the body, let garments punish the flesh, let labours grieue, watchings dry, let this man exclaime against mee, let this and that man molest mee, let colde make mee crooked, my conscience murmure, heate burne, the stomack swell, the countenaunce waxe pale, let me be wholie infeebled, let my life fayle in greefe and my yeeres in gronings, let rottennes enter my bones, & abound vnderneath mee, that I may rest in the day of tribulation, & ascend in a

               The Argument.
               In the infernal paines there is nothing founde that may comfort a man: for euen as the lot of the good is vniuersall good, which comprehendeth in it selfe all kindes of good, so also is the lot of the wicked vniuersall, which includeth in it all kindes of euill. For which cause, euery one sence of the wicked, shal be tortured with their peculier torments, aunswerable to the quality of tbeir sinne committed, without any dimunition, or hope of pardon, of terme, or of time. For the paines

of hell shal be eternall, intollerable, infinite, & continuall.
            
            CHAP. 5.
            TRuly the least of those blessings which hetherto vvee haue rehersed, might suffice to ingender in our mindes the loue of vertue, by which we may attaine so many goods. But no

               nall punishments which are prepared for the wicked bee annexed, who is he so hard-harted, and with vnbridled minde rebellious, that forsaking vices, will not vvillinglie embrace vertues? For the impious and peruerse man, cannot comfort himselfe with this voice: Be it I am euill and sinfull, what of that? I shal not enter the celestiall glory, neyther shall I reioyce with GOD: In this consisteth all my punishment. For the rest I care not, because I shal haue neither other punishment, nor other glory. Thou art deceiued my brother, the matter is far otherwise; for it is fatall and altogether necessary that one of these thinges

happen vnto thee, eyther that thou raigne alwayes with GOD, or that thou burne alwayes with the deuill in sempiternall fire. Betweene these two extreames there is no meane. These in the figure of those two baskets which our Lord shewed to Ieremy the prophet before the gate of the temple, are fitly shadowed. For the one of thē was replenished with very good figges,
                  Ierem. 24. such as those are of the first time, and the other basket had very badde figges in it, which coulde not be eaten because they were euill. Our Lord by thys spectacle, would demonstrate to the prophet two kindes of men, the one to whom he would extend his mercie, the other whom according to his iustice hee would punish. The lot of those first men shal be excellent good, neither can there be giuen better: but of the other most euill, then which worser may not be found.
            But that this may bee the better vnderstoode, it is to be noted,
                  Ex tract. 1. Memor.
                that all the euils of this present life, are onely single, and therefore when we suffer, one sence onely, or one

member suffereth, or if more, at least-wise all suffer not: As for example it appeareth in diuers infirmities of mans body; for one hath his eye affected, another is vexed with the head-ach; the third is troubled with a weake stomacke, the fourth is afflicted with the passion of the heart, and oth
                  •
               r by other diseases: But none of them all is tormented in all his members at once, but in some onely. Notwithstanding, wee daily see, how great the greefe is, & how much the paine, that one onely of these euils breedeth, and how vnquiet nights hee leadeth, that is only vexed with one of these paines, although it were but the aking of one tooth.
            But let vs suppose there is a man, who is tormented with such an vniuer
                  •
               all euill, that hee hath not one member, neyther one interior or exterior sence free from most greeuous agoni
                  •

                  •
               d, that in all the knockles and ioynts of his body, is pained with intollerable

                  •
               sion? Such affliction (my brother, if these thinges may any wayes be cōpared together) is that, which the damned shal suffer in hel, nor for one night, but without end, in all eternity. For euen as they with all the
                  •
               r members and sences offended God, and offered them all as weapons of iniustice to serue sin: so in

confused gnashing and groaning, which shall resounde in this place: The sent, by intollerable stench, exhaling out of this vncleane, filthy, and pestilent place: The taste, with raging hunger, and burning thirst: The touch, and all members of the body, shal bee tortured with colde and vnspeakable fire: The imagination shall suffer by the apprehension of present euils: but the memory by the remembrance of pleasu

               es past; & the vnderstanding by the consideration of goods lost, and mischiefes, by which wretched as they are, they are now ceazed.
            This multitude and diuersity of paine the holy Scripture expresseth, where it is said; That in hell shal be hunger & thirst, complaint & gnashings of teeth, doleful swords, spyrits created to do vengance, worms, serpents, scorpions, wormwood, water mixt with gall, spirits of tempests, & such like, by which is signified the multitude of the terrible & horrible punishments, which are ordained for the damned in this Lake. Furthermore, in this place, there shalbe darknes as well interior as exterior, aswel

               n the soule as in the body, vvhich shall be thicker and darker thē those of Egypt,

                is suddainly extinguished, but it shalbe such a fire as is agreeable with the place, which shall infinitely afflict, & neuer cease burning. If therefore all these things be true, howe can it be that all they that belieue & confesse no lesse, can liue in such vnspeakable carelesnesse, and slothfulnes? What may the trouble be, what labor so infinite, that a man would not willingly sustaine▪ that he might at least-wise escape the least of these forenamed torments? why therefore to auoyd this great and eternall euill, doe we refuse a little, & that pleasant labor, such as is the following of vertue?
            Truly this one thing were sufficient to him that seriously cōsidered, & fixed his whole mind & thought hereof, to driue him into a swound, and drawe him into melancholie. And if in so great torments, there

were at the least some hope of releefe or decreement, the damned might haue some consolation, bu

            ALthough Vertue bee by it selfe prayse-woorthy, and without it nothing may be laudable, neither may there bee any thing more amiable, and that more allureth men to good lyfe then the same: yet so are the manners of this world corupted, that the most part of men striue

                all. For which cause, that which men ought to doe willingly for the loue of honestie and vertue, to that now, by manie reasons and arguments, promises and threatnings, they are partly without intermission to bee inuited, partly to bee compelled: that leauing vices, they may followe vertues, and renouncing the world, with more cleannesse of life, they may wholy and onely incline to the seruice of God.
            Neyther is vertue so weake, neyther this matter so poore & naked, that it wanteth diuers & effectual arguments to incite and perswade the performance heereof. For whethe

               e, as S. Bernard testifieth, is a burning winde, drying vp the fountaines of pietie, the dewe of mercy, and the floods of grace. Yea, and whē a certaine old Souldiour beeing called in question, was in danger to loose his cause, hee publiquely came to Augustus Caesar, praying him to stand by him in his cause: Caesar gaue him presently a selected aduocate out of his company, and commended the clyent vnto him. Hereat the souldier cried out; But I Caesar when thou wert in danger in thy Actian warre, 
                  •
               ought not for a deputy, but fought for thee in person, & therwith discouered his scarrs. Caesar was heereat

                  ••
               , fearing least he should not onely be thought proud, but also vngrateful▪ Such impressions and motiues, haue the memory of benefites receaued▪ If so great a Caesar were so much mooued, by a common souldiers wounds receiued in his behalfe, that he rewarded one curtesie with another, why shoulde not, I say not the scarres, but the death also of so great a Maiesty wherby we are redeemed, preuaile with vs, most abiect wretched men? and this one is so great a benefit, as why should I speake of the others which are infinite? Whether therefore wee respect honestie and profit, whether their contraries heereby we are inuited, thereby inforced to followe Vertue, and to addict our selues to the seruice of God.
            But the diuine benefits although they are infinite, yet may they be reduced vnto fiue kindes, namelie: Creation, Conseruation, Redemption, Iustification, and Predestination: Of which fiue kindes of benefites we wil orderly intreat. For this cōsideration is profitable for diuers

causes, especially for three, which are thus rehearsed by our Authour.
            If we may belieue Aristotle, goodnes is amiable by it selfe,
                  Out of the 7. tract. lib. 1. of prayer and meditation.
                for euerie one is diligently fixed on the loue of himselfe. As therefore men by naturall inclination are louers of themselues, and of theyr owne profit, so when they manifestly perceiue that all that which they haue, is of the meare liberality and voluntarie gift of God himselfe, and their eternall Benefactor, they are suddainly inclined to the loue of him, from whom they know theyr graces are receiued. Hence it is, that amongst all considerations which are auailable towards the attainement of the loue of GOD, thys is most effectuall, which setteth before our eyes the d
                  •
               uine benefits. For euery seue
               
                  •
               all benefite receiued by vs, is as it were a Fornace or burning fire, kindling by his cleere flames, the loue of almighty GOD in vs. And consequently, to meditate on many benefits, is to kindle many fires, by whose ardent heate, our harts are more and more inflamed with the loue of God.
            
               For this consideration is profitable, to the ende that a man desirous to serue God, may be the more excited to his seruice, and become more forward, when he shall consider the great obligation whereby he is tye
                  •
                by so many benefits which he hat

How more requisite is it that they doe the like, who haue receaued farre more benefits, and haue greater iudgement to acknowledge the same. For when a man with great attention reckoneth vp with himselfe of the one part, the multitude of the benefites which he hath receaued from God, and on the other part calleth to remembrance the multitude of sinnes by which hee requiteth the diuine bounty, howe can hee but blush? howe can hee but setting the white by the blacke, knowe which is the better? that is, not vnderstand, the greatnesse of his malice, compared

with the greatnes of Gods goodnes, which bounty hath not so manie yeares intermitted to doe good vn

               The Argument.
               ¶ By reason of the benefits of our creation, we are bound to serue God in body and soule: For according to the law, a man oweth all that which he hath receaued, to him from whom hee hath receaued it. God created the body and the soule, hee created vs men, and to an excellent end. Besides, he not onely created vs, but doth daily perfect vs: For euerie thing that▪ hath his beginning, must ta

                  igation.
            
            CHAP. 7.
            THE first of the benefits is creation, of which, since it is notorious to all men, I will only enforce this, that a man for this onely cause is bound wholy to serue & honour God who created him. For according to the

law, a man is debter for all that which he hath receaued: when therfore by this benefit he hath receiued his being, that is, his body with all his sences, & his soule with all her powers▪ It foloweth, that he ought to imploy all these things in the seruice of his maker, except he will be accounted a theefe & vngratefull man toward

                  •
               he which giueth not more thē he receaued, obserueth not this law;
                  Honour is due to God, because he is our Father.
                what shal we say of him, that giueth lesse, then yt which was bestowed on him? And if (as Aristotle testifieth) we can not equiual

And if it be a hainous offence for a son to be disobediēt to his father, what impiety shal it be to rebel against god, who vnder so many bounties is our father? yea, & in comparison of whō, no man amongst men deserueth the name of a father? This is yt which iustly he expostulateth by his prophet.

                  By the consideration of his own creation, a man groweth into the knowledge of the Creator.
                For by the knowledge thereof, they should at last attaine the knowledge of that which in deede they ought to doe. And because men doe it not, they liue as if begotten of themselues.

                visitation hath kept my spirit? But what shall I say of the nobility of thy soule, and the excellencie of the end, for which it was created; and of the image and capacity that it hath? The image thereof, is the image of God himselfe. For there is not any thing to be found vppon the earth more like to God, and by which wee grow more easely and manifestly into the knowledge of God, then is mans soule. For which cause those auncient Philosophers, but especially Anaxagoras,

                     y the substance of the soule is hardly vnderstood
                and that for the great similitude which they founde betweene God and the soule. Heere-vpon it groweth, that the essence or substance of the soule can be comprehended by no vnderstanding, for in that it is so like the d

               uine substance, which since in this life cannot be vnderstoode; no otherwise may the

other be vnderstoode or comprehended.
            Besides, the end to which so noble a creature was made, is euery way correspondent to the nobility thereof: For it is most certaine that the soule was created, that it might be pertaker of incomprehensible glorie, and diuine felicity; that it might dwell in the house of God, enioy the same goods with God, and reioyce with the same ioy hee doth, and be cloathed with the same garment of immortality, and raigne with him for euer. And from hence draweth the soule that admirable capacity which she hath, which is so great, that all creatures, and the riches of this world gathered in one, are not sufficient, to fill the bosome of the capacity thereof; yea, so farre are they from filling it, as is a graine of millet in respect of the engine of the whole world.

What else are the parents, but certaine instruments by whose weake helpe God buildeth this body. If therefore thou owest so much to the meanes, how much shalt thou owe to the work-maister that made it? and if thou acknowledgest thy selfe to be indebted to him, that onely in one part of the work shewed himselfe industrious, how much shalt thou be indebted to him that consumated the whole worke.

            But if thou wilt diligently consider, howe many benefits shalt thou finde included in this one, for euen as many moments and poynts of time, as thy life hath had, hath, and shall haue, so many parts are there of this benefit, for that in no one of these shouldst thou either liue or be, if God had turned his eyes frō thee. All creatures what soeuer they be in this world, are the parts of this benefite, because wee see all of them haue their beeing, and ayme to this end, that they should serue and bee accommodate to our vse: for after this manner the heauen is thine, and the earth, the Sunne, the Moone, the starres; the sea, fishes, byrdes, foure-footed beasts, trees, plants, and to speake in a word, all thinges what soeuer are created, are deuoted to thy seruice, vvhich in his Psalmes the kingly prophet wondereth at.
                  Psal. 8. Neither content that he had created all visible creatures to our vse, his further will was also, through his immesurable mercy, that all invisible

creatures, such as are those noble intelligences, which are alwayes standing before the presence of God, and behold his diuine face, should serue for our vses. For all the Angels, as S. Paule testifieth, are administring spirits, sent to take charge ouer those, who shall possesse the heritage of saluation. F

            VVhat soeuer is founde vnder heauen▪
               
                  Ex duce peccat li. 1. ca. 3 eyther is for the vse of man, or to the vse of that thing which serueth man. For although man (to speak properly) doe not eate flies which flie in the ayre, yet feedeth he on other birds which are sustained by those flies, &c althogh he eate not the weeds of the field, yet nourisheth he himselfe by those diuers kinds of beasts, which are pastured by those herbes. Turne & returne thine eyes

into all the clymes & corners of the world, and thou shalt see howe spacious the bounds are of thy riches, & how opulent thine inheritance is. All that which walketh on the earth, swymmeth in the Seas, flyeth in the ayre, shineth in the heauens, is thine. But all these are the benefits of god, and the workes of his prouidence, and

               he mirrors of his beauty; the testimonies of his mercy, the sparks of his charitie, and the exemplifications of his liberalitie. See how many cryers & Preachers God sendeth vnto thee, that thou mayst know him. All that are in heauen and in earth, saith S. Augustine, tell me that I must loue thee my God, and cease not to cry out the like to all men, that no man may be excused.
            Yf thou hast eares to vnderstand the voyces of creatures, thou shalt manifestly perceaue, howe all of them doe together teach thee to loue GOD. For all they in silence doe protest that they were made for thy benefit, that thou for thy selfe, & for them, shouldst serue their and thine own Lord. The heauen saith: I giue thee light by day, & by night

thorow the ministery of Moone & starres I preuent least thou shouldst walke in darknes; and sundry influences sende I downe, that diuers things may grow and increase, least thou shouldst die with famine. The Ayre sayth: I apply my selfe that thou maist breathe into me, I coole thee, I temperate thine internall heate, least it consume thee: I haue diuers kindes of byrds in me, that by their variety and pulchritude should delight thine eyes, by theyr songs thine eares, and by their taste thy palate.
            The water saith, I serue thee with my raines and showres, according to the fixed seasons of the yeere: with my floods and fountaines also that thou mayst coole thee: I bring foorth and nourish diuers kinde of fishes, that they may bee meate for thee. I water thy seede, thy gardens and fruitfull trees, that thou mightst by all them be nourished. I yeelde thee passage through the midst of the sea, that thou mayst traffique through the whole world, and that thou mightest annexe to thy riches, the riches of another world or Hemisphere.

What thinkest thou the earth will say, which is the common mother of all, & as it were the shop or tauerne of all things naturall. She truly, and that not without cause, shall say; I sustaine thee, an vnprofitable burthen, I beare thee like a mother in mine armes, I prouide thee of necessaries, I sustaine thee with the fruites of my wombe, I haue communion or participation with all other elements, with all the heauens, and from euery one of the influences, doe I cull out & choose benefites to fructifie for thee; I finally like a good mother, neyther in lyfe nor in death forsake thee; for in life I suffer thee to trample me w
                  •
               th thy feete, I sustaine thee; I giue thee in death a place of rest, & hide thee in my bowels. What need many wordes? The whole vvorlde with a loude voyce cryeth; Behold how my Lord and Creator intirelie loueth thee, who hath created mee for thy loue, & would that I should serue thee, & thou likewise shouldst serue him, that gaue mee to thee, and created thee for himselfe.
            These are (ô man) the voices of all

creatures: Consider now that there is none so absurd deafnes, as to hea
                  •
                these voyces, and to be vngratefull, for so many and great benefits. If thou hast receaued a good turn, pay thy due in thanksgiuing, that thou haue no cause to bee plagued with the scourge of ingratitude: For euery creature (as a certaine Doctor hath wel noted) speakes to a man in three wordes: Take, Restore, and Beware; That is, Take a benefite, Restore that thou owest; Beware (except thou restore) the punishmēt. Is it possible for thee (christian) that without intermission receiuest these benefits, that sometimes thou sholdst not lift vp thine eyes to heauen, that thou maist see who hee is, who giueth thee so many good things? Tell, if thou shouldst happen (being wearied in thy iourney) to rest at the foote of some Tower, greatly afflicted wt hunger & thirst▪ & that there were one in the tower should send thee meate & drinke, as much as thou wouldst require couldst thou containe thy selfe, but that thou wouldst lift vp thine eyes somtimes, that thou mightst see who

hee was, that had so well deserued at thy handes? I thinke truly that thou couldst not. What els doth god f
                  •
               ō his highest heauen, but without intermission poure down his benefits vpon thee. Shew me any thing, smal or great, that is not giuen frō aboue by the speciall prouidence of God? why therefore somtimes liftest thou not vp thy eyes to heauen, that thou maist acknowledge & loue so liberall a Lord, & continual benefactor? what other thing is intended by this carelesnes, but that men shewe that they haue laide aside the nature of men, & are degenerated into vnreasonable creatures? For in this we resemble hogs feeding vnder an oake, who whilst their keeper ascendeth the tree, and with his whip or staffe beateth downe the acornes, are so much busied in eating, grunting, & beating one another frō the mast, as that they mark not who gaue them the meat, neither know they how to loop vp, that they may see frō whose handes that benefite descended. O vngratful sons of Adam, who besides the light of reason, hauing theyr shapes erect, and faces formed to

behold the heauens, yet wil not lift vp their eyes and mindes that they may see & acknowledge theyr Benefactor, and giue him thankes for his goodnes.
            The lawe of gratuitie is so generall, and so well liking vnto GOD, that in the very beasts themselues, he would this inclination should be imprinted, as we may manifestly behold in sundry examples. VVhat is more fierce then the Lyon?

The same man beeing long after that apprehended and brought to Rome, and condemned to the beastes, and opposed to the sayd Lyon, (which by good hap was likewise taken and brought to Rome) was acknowledged and saued by him: & both the slaue and the Lyon receaued theyr liberty, and alwayes after liued together in great amitie. The lyke also Plinie writeth, to haue hapned to Helpus the Samian by a Lion.

reporteth, that some there haue beene that lamented theyr maisters death,

                  Lib. 8. ca. 40. When King Nicomedes was slaine, his horse starued himselfe to death. Some reuenged the death of theyr maisters with striking and byting. These thinges are of small moment, if we compare them with the fidelitie, friendship, and gratitude of doggs, of which Plinie reporteth admirable things.
            If therefore beasts (in whō there is no reason, but onely a sparckle of a certaine naturall instinct, by which they acknowledge a benefite) are so grateful, and in all things that in thē lyeth, helpe, obey, and serue theyr benefactors; howe can it be that a man, that is blessed with such a light to acknowledge receiued benefites, should be so carelesse, & so slightly should forget him, from whom so many benefits are deriued? If it be such a haynous offence not to loue this Lord God, what shall it bee to offend him, and to violate his commaundements? Can it bee possible ô man, that thou shouldest haue

hands to offend those handes which haue beene so liberall towards thee, that euen for thy sake, they haue at the last been fastned to the Crosse?
            When that lasciuious and shamelesse woman, allured the holy Prosphet Ioseph to adultery, and sollicited him to bee vnfaithfull to his Lord and maister, the chast young man defended him-selfe after thys manner; Behold, my Maister hath deliuered all things into my hands, not knowing what hee hath in his house, neyther is there any thing which is not at my commaund, beside thy selfe, who art his wife; how therefore can I doe this wickednes, and sinne against my Maister? As if he should say; If my Lord bee so good and liberall towards me, if he hath committed all that is his to my trust, if hee hath dignified mee with such honor, how can I who am tied vnto him by so many offices of kindnes, haue my hands ready to offend so good a maister? In vvhich place it is to be noted, that hee was not content to say; It becōmeth me not to offende thee, or I must not doe it: but he sayd: How may I do

this euill, and so foorth: signifying that the greatnes of the benefites, ought not only to restraine the wil, but also the power, and take away the force likewise to offende our Lord God in any thing.
            That man had credited all that he had in Iosephs hand, and God hath committed that which hee hath to thee. Compare nowe those thinges that GOD hath, with those things which that man had, and see howe farre greater & more excellent they be then those which the other possessed? Redoubled are those which thou receauest from God, if thou compare them with that which Ioseph receaued from that man. Tell mee (I pray thee,) what faculties? what riches hath GOD, which hee hath not communicated with thee? Heauen, earth, moone, starres, seas, floods, fowles, fishes, trees, liuing creatures, to conclude, all that that is found vnder heauen is in thy hands. What? not only those things which are vnder heauen are in thy power, but also those things that are aboue the heauens, namely, the glory of them, and eternall goodnes.
            
               All thinges are yours, sayth the Apostle, whether it be Paule, or Apollo, or Cephas, or the worlde, or life, or death, or thinges present, or things to come; for all thinges are yours, that is, ordained for your saluation.
            But what if I say, that thou hast not onely those things which are aboue the heauens, but that the very Lord also of all heauens, is endowed to thee after a thousand manners? Hee is giuen thee as a Father, as a Tutor, as a Sauiour, as a Maister; He is thy Phisition, he is the reward of thy redemption; he is thy example, thy helpe, thy remedy, and thy keeper.

                then truth, that God hath deliuered all that he hath into thy hands, how can it bee that thou shouldst haue handes to prouoake him? VVhat thinkest thou it may bee suffered that thou shouldst be ingrate to such

a gracious Father, and a Benefactor so liberall? Truly this seemeth to be a most haynous offence? but if to this ingratitude thou annex contempt of thy Benefactour, and iniurie or contempt howe inexpiable a crime wil that be held? If that yong man (of whom I spake before) thought himselfe so bound that he had no power to offende him▪ that had committed all the substance of his house into his bands: How shalt thou finde any force in thy selfe to offend him, who gaue thee heauen, earth, and himselfe?
         
         
            
               The Argument.
               ¶ The benefit of Predestination is the first and greatest of all benefits, and which is meerely giuen gratis, without any precedent merrit. The greatnes therefore of this benefit, and all those things which pertaine therevnto, greatly prouoke a man to serue God, and to be dutifull vnto him.
            
            CHAP. 9.
            AMongst the diuine benefites also, Predestination or Election is to be nūbred, which as it is the first, so also it is

the most excellentest, and altogether necessary for our saluation. But this benefite is onely theyrs whom God hath chosen from the beginning, to take possession of the eternall beatitude and the heauenly kingdome. For which benefite, the Apostle, as well for himselfe as for all the elect, giueth him thanks in these wordes; Blessed bee God, and the Father of our Lord Iesus Christ,
                  Ephes. 1. &c. who hath predestinated vs in the adoption of his sonnes through Iesus Christ. The kingly prophet cōmendeth that benefit likewise, when he saith. Blessed is he whō thou hast chosen,
                  Psalm, 64 ô lord, and hast taken to inhabite in thy Courts. Deseruedly therefore may this benefite be called the benefit of benefits, and the grace of graces▪ It is the grace of graces, because it is giuen before all merrite, of Gods onely infinite goodnes and liberalitie: who setting a part iniuries, nay rather giuing to euery one su

               cient helpe to saluation▪ imparteth more aboundantly to some the greatnes of his mercy, like an absolute & liberall Lorde of his riches: And it is the benefit of benefits, not only because

it is greater then the rest, but for that it is the cause and foundation of all other benefits also. For when as a man is chosen to glorie, by meanes of this benefite, GOD presently imparteth to him other benefites also, which are required towards the attaynment of this glorie: euen as he testifieth by his prophet, saying; In perpetuall charitie haue I loued thee, therefore in mercie haue I drawne thee vnto mee.
                  Ieremy. 31.
            
            That is, thou oughtest not to bee ignorant, that I called thee to my grace, that by the same thou mightest attayne my glory. But the Apostle speaketh of this benefit more plainely, when hee sayth; Because those whom hee fore-knew, those likewise hee predestinated, to bee made conformable to the image of his Sonne, that hee might bee the first begotten among many Bretheren. Those therefore whom he hath predestinated, those also hee hath called; and whom hee hath called, them also hath hee iustified: and those whom hee hath iustified, them also hath he glorified.
            
               The reason thereof is, that our Lord disposing all things sweetly & orderly, after he hath vouchsafed to choose any one to his glory, for that grace, he conferreth diuers others; for he giueth all those things which are pertinent toward the attainment of that first grace. Euen as the Father that bringeth vp his Sonne eyther to make him a Priest or a doctor, causeth him from his infancie to be exercised in Ecclesiastical affaires, or brought vp in diuiner studdies, & directeth all the course of his life to that intended and purposed end: So likewise that ete
                  •
               nall Father, after hee hath chosen any man to the communion of his glory, hee directeth him by his fatherly care to the way of iustice, which bringeth him to that glory, and in the same doth faithfully conduct his elected, till he attaine the desired end. For this so great and excellent benefite, they ought to yeelde our Lord thankes, who acknowledge any notable fruit of this benefite in themselues. For let vs grant that this secrete is hidden from mortall eyes, yet whereas certaine signes of iustification are

known, there also the signes of predestination or election may be had. For as amongst the signes of iustification, amendement of life is not the least, so amongst the signes of election, the greatest is perseuerance in good life.
            Which beeing thus, wey I pray thee with thy selfe, ô man, vnder howe great an assurance our Lorde holdeth thee bound vnto him, for this immesurable benefite, namely to bee registred in that booke, of which our Redeemer sayde to his Apostles, Doe not reioyce in thys, that spirits are subiected vnto you, but reioyce because your names are written in the booke of life. Howe immesurable therefore is this benefite, to be beloued, and from eternitie elected, from which God was God? to rest in his most sweet bosome, euen from the yeeres of eternitie, to be accounted the adoptiue Sonne of God then, wh
                  •
               n as his naturall Sonne was begotten in the brightnes of his Saints, who were present in his diuine vnderstanding? Attentiuely therfore consider all the circumstances of this election, and

thou shalt finde euery one of them to be singuler benefites; yea, & that great ones also, and such as tye thee vnder newe couenaunts. Consider  first of all his dignitie who choase thee, who is God himselfe, blessed and infinitely rich, who neither needeth thine, nor any other mans riches.  Wey howe vnwoorthy hee is who is chosen, if you consider hi
                  •
                quality and nature: for is a miserable and mortall creature, subiect to all infirmities, miseries, and pouertie of this life, guiltie of the punishments of hell, aswell for others, as his owne sin also.
            
                Thirdly, apprehend howe excellent the election is, after that thou art chosen to so hie an end, then which there can be no greater; that is, that thou mightest be made the sonne of GOD, the heyre of his kingdome, and pertaker of his glorie.  Fourthly attend, howe free th
                  ••
                election is, when as it is, as I haue said, aboue all thy mer
                  •
               it, of Gods onely free will and goodnesse; and as the Apostle sayth, by the glorie and prayse of Gods liberalitie, and his especiall grace▪ Now, a benefite

the more free it is, by so much the more holdeth it a man obliged.
            Fiftly, the antiquity of this election is to bee considered, for it began  not with the constitution of the world, but is more ancient then the world it selfe. Yea, it is of the same age that God himselfe is, who as he is from all eternity, so from eternity. loued he his elect, whom he beholdeth with his fatherly and truly benigne eyes, remembring himselfe alwayes, to what an excellent good he hath fore-ordained and predestinated them.
            Sixtly, the rarenes of the reward  is to bee considered; Since that amongst so many Nations of barbarous people, and amidst so great a multitude of damned men, our Lorde would vouchsafe to call thee to so blessed a lot, that thou shouldest bee of the number of those, which were chosen to euerlasting life, and that therefore he seperated thee from the masse of corruption of mankinde, cōdemned for sinnes, and hath changed thee from the leuen of corruption, into the breade of Angels.
            
               In this consideration, a few things shall be found, which may be written, and many things which may be weyed in minde, that the elected may be gratefull to our Lorde God for the perticularitie of this benefit, which is so much the greater, by how much the number of the elect is lesser, and of those which are to be damned greater, the number of whom (as Salomon affirmeth) is infinite.
            But if none of these things moue thee, yet at least-wise let the greatnes of the expence, which our most liberall Lorde had determined to make by reason of this benefite, moue thee. Such as is the lyfe of his onely begotten Sonne, and his blood shedde in the behalfe of thys benefit: who had decreed from eternitie, to send him into this world, that hee might be the executor of this diuine determination. VVhich since it is so, what time shalbe more conuenient and profitable, to consider so great mercie of GOD! VVhat tongue shall more plainlie expresse the same? What hart vvith greater affection feele, and more

intire sweetnes taste the same?
            Finally, with what seruices may the same bee recompenced? VVith what loue may a man aunswere this diuine loue? Who will bee so vngratefull as to refuse now at length to loue him, of whom from eternitie hee hath beene beloued? Who woulde change this friende for anie other what soeuer?
            Wherefore, since that in holie Scriptures, a friend of so many yeres is so much praysed and had in estimation, who woulde change the possession and grace of so great a friende, for all the friendes of the worlde? And if prescription or possession of time, with memorie giueth him both right and authority who hath neyther, what will thys eternall possession doe, by which our Lorde is possessed, that by the title of this friendship wee may be reputed for his. By these it appeareth, that there are no blessings to be founde in this world, wh
                  •••

               ay deserue to be exchanged with these, neither are there so great euils which are not to bee endured for the loue of these benefites.
            
               Who (I pray you) is he could be so dull & inconsiderate, that beeing taught by diuine reuelation, that a certain poore begger seeking his liuing from doore to dore, were after this maner predestinat by god, wold not kisse the earth wheron he troad? would not giue him place? woulde not hūbling himselfe on his knees, with all humility, wish him al good, & gratify him in this maner; ô most happy, ô most blessed, art thou one of that happy number of the elect? shalt thou reioyce amongst the blessed troopes of Angells? shalt thou sing that celestial musique? & possesse that perpetual kingdom? sha

               eadeth thee to eternall life: what cloude of calamities and tribulations shal there be so thick, which shal not vanish vnder so great a hope?
            These, & such like are the wordes we would vse, & speake to any man whō wee certainly knew to be predestinated. For if a certaine princ

Howe much more therefore ought menne to admire this blessed lot? namely, that a man should be born, & (without any of his merrit) chosen, not to bee a temporall king in this world, but to raigne in heauen with God himselfe▪ for euer & euer. By these things therefore (my brother) thou maist easily cōceaue the great bond whereby al the elect are tied for this benefit to their Lord & Elector; frō which let no man suppose himselfe excluded, if he will do his duty, and not hinder himselfe.
            
               Yea, it shall be needfull (as Sa

                Peter warneth) in all his workes, to make sure his vocation & election: for we are assured that he that doth this shall be saued; and we knowe also, that Gods grace & fauour doth neuer leaue any man, neyther will heereafter leaue any one destitute.
         
         
            
            
               The Argument.
               The benefite of Redemption exceedeth all eloquence, and were rather to be adored then expressed, rather men had neede of some certaine knowledge thereof. Man by sinne was made like vnto the deuill: GOD might haue left him in damnation like the deuill, but hee would not: Hee turned his wrath into mercie, hee sent not an Angell, but he himselfe comming after an vnspeakeable manner, redeemed him. Hee was admirable in his comming, & for that man is much indebted vnto GOD, yet much more for the meanes of his redemption, which comprehendeth the whole passion of Christ. Christ died not for one, but for all, & this increaseth the debt.

After the same manner, all our vnderstanding, art, & eloquence are defectiue, in declaring this vnspeakable benefite of our redemption. For which cause perhaps wee might haue done farre better, if wee had worshipped the same with silence, that in some maner by this deuice wee might expresse the greatnes thereof. The benefit of our creation is vnspeakable, but of our Redemption more admirable: for God created all things with the onely beck of his will; b

               , yea & by so much was boūd to God by straight bonds, by how much he had receaued more greater benefites at his hands; he becam vndutiful & rebellious▪ & of those things from which he ought to haue takē greater cause of loue towards his Creator, of the same he tooke greatest occasions to betray him. For that cause was hee thrust out of Paradise, & thrust in exile, yea & allotted to infernal paines;

to the end that hee that had been
                  •
                made companion with the deuill in sinne, should be also associate with him in punishment. Helizeus the prophet, said to his seruaunt Giezi, Thou hast taken siluer & rayments from Naaman,4. Reg. 1. therefore Naamans leprosie, shall cleaue vnto thee and thy seede for euer. Such was the iudgement of GOD against man, who whē he had affected the goods and riches of Lucifer, (namelie his pride and ambition) it was iust and requisite that he should be infected with the leprosie of the same Lucifer, which was the punishment of his pride. Behold therefore man made like vnto the deuill.
            Nowe the diuine iustice might haue left man by al right in this miserable estate, euen as he left the deuil without any contradiction & expostulation: yet would hee not doe so, but rather did the contrary, chaning his wrath into mercy, & by how much the more iniury he had receiued, by so much the more grace would he shew his loue to mankind. And whereas also he might haue repaired this ruine, by an Angell, o
                  •
               
               
Archangel; he would com himselfe. But how? in what form cam he? & howe redeemed hee vs? What humaine tongue wil expresse this vnto vs? Whē as he might haue com in maiesty & glory, he would not, but he came in great humility & pouertie. Christ established such friendship betwixt God & vs, that not only god forgaue man all his sin, receiued him into his fauour, made him one and the same with him by a straight cō
               nexion of loue, but (that which exceedeth all greatnes) he made such a similitude & correspondence betwixt himselfe & mans nature, that amongst all thinges created, there might no such cōformity be found, as are the Deitie and humanitie, for they are not one & the same only in loue & grace, but also in person.
            Who durst euer but haue hoped, that that so wide wound shold haue been closed after this manner? who might euer haue imagined, yt these two things▪ betwixt which there was so much difference of nature & offence, should so closely bee vnited? not in one house, not at one table, not in one grace, but in one and the

same person? What two things may be thought more contrary thē God and a sinner, and what is more neerly annexed or more commixt, then God and man? There is noth

Who wold haue said to a man when hee was naked, & assertained that he had incurd the displeasure of our Lord, when hee sought retyring places in Paradise wherin he might hide himselfe▪ who I say woulde then haue said to him that the time should one day com wherein this so vild substance shold be vnited with God in one and the same person?

Truly death might seperate the soule from the body, which was the vnion of nature: but neither could he separate God from the soule, or draw him from the body; for such was the vnion of the diuine person, that what is apprehended once with so firme an vnion, it neuer will forsake: And all these th

            ¶ All this Chapter is taken partly out of the first booke of the Guide of a sinner, chap. 4, partly out of the first of Prayer and Meditation, the 3, chap. Of the 7. tractate, on which places he purposely handleth our redemption. Thou shalt finde many things also touching this matter in the life of Christ, and in the booke of the Catechisme.
         
         
            
               The Argument.
               Without the benefite of Iustification all other benefits had nothing at all profited vs, nay rather they had done

vs harme. Now Iustification is the worke of the holy Ghost, without which no man can be saued. Iustification therefore is a great bond of our duty; especially because it concludeth in it selfe so many and so great goods; which are rehearsed in this Chapter. Moreouer, Iustification is a greater benefitte then Creation. And howe a man may gather by certaine coniectures, that he is iustified.
            
            CHAP. 11.
            NOthing at all had the hethe
                  •
               to rehearsed benefites profited vs, if the blessings of vocation, and iustification, and sanctification had not followed. For that I may ouerpasse the other with silence, whi

               h had beene in vaine, and to our great mischiefe, what vse had there beene of that onely and noble benefit of our redemption, if iustification had not been annexed? For euen as the plaister is of no vse, if it be not applied to the wound, or place affected, 
                  •
               o had there beene no profit of this celestiall medicine, except by

the meanes of this benefitte it had be

                  •
               ares of sinne being broken and rent a sunder, he escapeth the dominion and tiranny of the deuill he is raised againe from death to life, of a sinner he is made iust; and of the sonne of malediction, hee is made the sonne of God: which can no wayes be done without the peculier helpe and succour of God, the which our Lorde testifieth in expresse wordes; No man can come vnto mee,
                  Iohn, 6. except my father drawe him. Signifying heereby, that neither free will, nor the forces of humaine nature, can of themselues deliuer a man from sinne, and bring him vnto grace: except the a

               me of the deuine power be assistant. Euen as a stone of his own
                  •
                nature falleth alwayes downwardes, neyther can tend vpwardes without externall ayde: So also a manne through the corruption of his sinne, alwayes tendeth downward, that is,

falleth in loue, and desireth earthlie things. But if he be to be erected & lifted vpwards▪ that is, raysed to loue and supernaturall desire, hee had neede of the right hand of the omnipotent and diuine helpe.
            Many benfites are contayned in this one. VVhen as therefore the consideration of thys benefite, vehemently inciteth a man to gratitude, & desire of vertue, I will heere by the way expresse the great profites which this one onely good is wont to bring with it.
            First, by it a man is reconciled to  Almightie GOD, and is restored to his loue and friendship. For the first and greatest of all euills, which begetteth mortall sinne in the soule, is▪ th
                  •
               t it maketh a man enemie to GOD, who whereas he is infinite goodnesse, aboue all things hateth and detesteth sin.
            Therefore sayth the Prophet Dauid,
                  Psalm. 5. Thou hatest all those that work iniq
                  •
               ity, thou shalt destroy them that speake lyes. This is the fountaine 
                  •
               oote, & originall of all euills. Frō this so perilous euill, we are deliuered by y• means of Iustification,

by which we are reconciled to God, and of his enemies made his friends; and that not in the common degree of friendship, but in the highest degree that may be found, which is of the father towardes his sonne. This friendship Saint Iohn Euangelist deseruedly cōmendeth, when he saith. Behold what charity God hath shewed you,1, Iohn. 3. that you are both benamed, and be the sonnes of God▪ Not content to haue said, that wee are named, he addeth also that wee be, that the pufilanimity and little trust of men might manifestly know the beneficence & liberality of God. And if in this world it be esteemed a thing of great moment, if any man should be honoured by his superiours, as by Bishops, Kings, Princes, or such like Potentates: I pray you what shall it be to be well thought of by the highest Prince, the supreame Father, and the greatest Lord: in comparison of whom, all the principalities & dignities of this world, are as if they were not?
            Another benefit fore-passing the  other, followeth: that Iustification deliuereth a man from the condemnation

of eternall punishment, of which he was guilty for his sinnes. Which how great a benefit it is, he aft
                  •
               r a sort knoweth, that hath diligently ouer-reade the fift chapter placed before, in which we haue rehearsed certayne sortes of punishments. From all those punishments God hath deliuered them, whom he hath iustified, all which after they are reconciled, and receaued into his fauour, are freed frō that wrath and paine of diuine reuenge.
            Behold another benefit more spirituall, which is the reformation and  innouation of the inwarde manne, which by sinne was defiled and disordered. For sinne doth not onely depriue the soule of God, but spoileth it of all supernaturall fortitude, and all the ritches and gifts of the holy Ghost, by which it was adorned, decked, and enritched: and as soone as it is depriued from the graces of these goods, it is wounded, maimed, and spoiled also of the naturall goods. For whereas a man is a reasonable creature, and sinne is a worke made against nature, and it is naturall that euery contrary destroy

his opposit: it followeth that by how much more our sinns are multiplied▪ by so much the powers of the soule are destroyed & troubled, not in themselues, but in theyr toward workings. After this manner doe sinnes make the soule miserable, infirme, slowe, and instable to all goodnes, but ready and prompt to all euill, they make her weake to resist temptations, and slowe to walke the way of the commaundements of our Lord. They also depriue her of th
                  •
                true liberty and dom
                  •
               nion of the Spirit, and make her captiue to the world, the deuill, the flesh and her owne appetites: and after this manner, shee liueth in harder captiuitie then that of Babylon or Egypt. Besides, all the spirituall sences of the minde are made slow, so that they neither heare the voyces and diuine inspirations: neither see the great eu
                  •
               ls that are prepared for them, neither smell the sweet odor of vertue, nor the woorthy examples of the Saints, nor taste how sweet our lord is, nor feele his scourges nor acknowledge his benefites by which he prouoketh thē to loue.

And besides all this, they take away the peace & ioy of conscience, extinguish the feruor of the Spirit, and leaue a man defiled, lothsome, deformed, & abhominable in the sight of God and all his Saints. This benefite deliuereth vs from all these euils. For the Abiss of diuine mercy, is not content to haue pardoned our sinnes, and to haue receiued man into his fauour, except hee also expell all those euills which sinnes bring with them, reforming & renewing our inward man. After thys manner he healeth our woundes, hee washeth our vncleannes, he breaketh the bonds of sinners, destroyeth the yoake of euill desires, deliuereth vs frō the seruitude of the deuil, mittigateth the fury of our peruerse affections, & restoreth vnto vs the tru liberty & pulchritude of the soule, giueth vs peace & ioy of good conscience, quickneth our interior sences▪ & maketh them prompt to doe all goodnes, & slow to all wickednes. He maketh them strong to resist temptations of the deuill, & endoweth them with good works. To conclude, so absolutely renueth hee

and repaireth he our interiour man with all his powers; as the Apostle feareth not to call such kind of men, iustified, renewed, or rather new
                  •
                creatures. This renouation is so great, that when it is giuen by Baptisme, it is called regeneration, and when it is restored by repentance, it is called resurrection: not onely because the soule is raised from the death of sinne, to the life of grace; but because in a certaine manner it imitateth the beauty of the future resurrection. And that is so true, that no tongue of man is sufficient to expresse the beauty of the iustified soule; but only that spirit knoweth this, that beautifieth the same, and maketh it his temple, & lodgeth himselfe in it.
            Wherefore if thou compare all the ritches of this world, all his honours, all his naturall graces, and all his acquired vertues, with the beautie and ritches of the soule that is iustified, all of them shall seeme most obscure & vild in comparison thereof. For as great difference as there is betwixt heauen and earth, betweene the spirit and the bodie,

betweene eternity and time, so great also is founde betwixt the life of grace, & the lyfe of nature, between the beauty of the soule, and of the body, betwixt the interior and exterior riches, betweene spirituall and naturall fortitude. For all these are circumscribed by certaine termes, are temporall, and seeme only faire to the out ward eye, to which the generall concourse of God is sufficient, but to those other, a perticuler & supernaturall concourse is required: neyther can they be called temporall, where as they bring to eternity, neither any wayes termed finite, be
                  •
               ause they deserue God, in whose eyes they are so precious, and of such value, that by theyr beautie they prouoke God himselfe to loue. But whereas God might worke all these thinges by his onely presence, he would not doe it; but it pleased him to adorne the soule with infused vertues, and with the 7. dowers of the holie Spirit; with which, not onel
                  •
                the very essence of the soule it selfe but also all the powers thereof are inuested and adorned with these diuine habits.
            
               Besides all these diuine benefites, that eternall and infinite goodnesse of God annexeth an other, namely, the presence of the holy ghost, or rather, of the whole blessed Trinitie, which entreth into the iustified soule, and commeth to inhabite in the same, that it may teach her how to vse in due sort so great riches.
            Like to a good Father, who not content to haue giuen his riches to his sonne, giueth him a tutor also, who knoweth howe to administer them well. So that euen as in the soule of a sinner, Vipers, Dragons, and Serpents inhabite, who are the multitude of malignant spirits, who haue taken vp their lodging in such a soule,
                  Math. 12, as our Sauiour in S. Mathew affirmeth: So contrariwise into the iustified soule, the holy Ghost, with the whole sacred Trinitie doe enter, and casting out all monsters and infernall beasts,
                  Luke, 11. consecrateth the same for a temple for himselfe, and placeth his seate there. As our Lorde himselfe expresly testifieth in the gospell written by Saint Iohn,
                  Iohn, 14. saying; If any man loue mee, hee wil obserue my sayings, and my Father

shall loue him, and we will com vnto him, & make our mansion with him.
            By vertue of these wordes, all the Doctors, as well Ecclesiasticall as Scholasticall, doe confesse that the holy Ghost himselfe, truly and after a certaine speciall manner, dooth dwell in the iustified soule, distinguishing betwixt the holy ghost & his gyfts; saying moreouer, that not onely these gifts of the holy Ghost 
                  •
               re giuen, but yt the holy ghost also, giueth himselfe, who entring into this soule, maketh her his temple, and habitation, fixing his seate in 
                  •
               he same. Hee therefore purgeth 
                  •
               he same, sanctifieth & decketh her with his vertues, that shee may be a sufficient mansion wherein hee may inhabite.
            The aboue named benefites suffice  not, except another and that admirable be ioyned vnto thē, name
               
                  •
               ie, that all the iustified are made the lyuing members of our Sauiour, who were first but dead members: For they dyd not receaue the 
                  •
               nfluences from theyr Lord & head Christ.
            
               Hence doe orher, and they very great prerogatiues and excellencies arise. For hence commeth it that Gods onelie Sonne loueth them, as his owne members, and hath no lesse care of them then of himselfe: hee is no lesse solicitous for them, then for his owne members, without intermission, hee powreth into them his vertues, as the heade into his members. Finally, the etern

               Neyther doe the diuine benefites heere take theyr end, for to all the fore-sayd graces thys is annexed at the last; to which all the other are disposed, namely, the right and possession of eternall lyfe, which is giuen to the iustified.

            These thē are the benefit

               , which that onely benefite of Iustification comprehendeth in it selfe: which Iustification,

                Saint Augustine esteemeth more then Creation: for God created heauen & earth by his onelie word; but that hee might truly sanctifie man, he

If therefore wee are indebted to this God, such and so many wayes for our creation, howe much more owe wee him, for our sanctification? which benefite, by how much more greater labors and afflictions it is attained, by so much the more it obligeth vs.
            
               But although a man doe not yet euidently know whether he be truly iustified, yet euery one may haue great cōiectures of his iustification, amongst the which this is not the least, namely, the amēdment of life, when as hee that was wont to perpetrate a thousand sinns in one day, now committeth not one. Hee that is such a one, let him remember with what iust cause he is bound to serue such a sanctifier, who redeemed him, & deliuered him from so many euils, & stored him with so many blessings as are hetherto rehea

               The Argument.
               The graces & gifts of the holy-Ghost, and those wonderfull effects which they worke in vs, are such and so many, that whether a man will or no, except hee will be altogether ingratefull, hee ought in leauing his loose behauiour, to intend the seruice of God. No lesse are the benefites of Baptisme, and most great bounties of the Sacrament of the Eucharist; all which inuite vs to the amendment of our liues.
            
            CHAP. 12.
            THose things which we haue hetherto spoken, comprehende not as yet all those kinds of benefits which the holy ghost worketh in the soule of a man that is iustified, neyther is Gods liberalitie concluded in those termes. For it suffiseth not the diuine Spirit to haue led man in by the gate of iustice, but after that man hath entred, hee is likewise assisted by the same Spirit, and is led by the hand into all his wayes, till

the waues of this stormy sea beeing ouer-ceased, hee attaine safe and secure to the hauen of saluation. For after that (by the means of the foresaid benefite) the holy ghost hath entred into the iustified soule, hee sitteth not there idle, it su
                  •
               ficeth him not to grace the soule with his presence, but with his vertue also hee sanctifieth the same, working in her, and with her, whatsoeuer is conuenient for her saluation.
            Hee sitteth there like the Father of a familie in his house, gouerning the same: hee sitteth there like a Maister in a schoole, administring it: like a gardner in his garden, trimming it: like a king in his kingdom ruling it: like the Sun in the world, illuminating it: Finally, like the soule in the body, giuing him lyfe, sence, & motion: not as the forme in his matter, but as the Father of his familie in his houshold.
            What therefore is more blessed, and more to bee desired, then for a man to haue in him-selfe such a guest, such a guyde, such a companion, such a gouernour, finallie, such a tutor and helper? who beeing

all in all, worketh also all things in the soule in which it abideth. But especially like fire hee illuminateth our vnderstanding, inflameth our will, and exalteth vs from the earth vnto the heauens.
            Hee like a Doue maketh vs simple, milde, peaceable, and friendes to all men. Hee like a clowd, cooleth vs, and defendeth v

But if after the grace of this vocation▪ thou hast lost thine innocence of Baptisme by thy recumbencie in sin, behold it pleased our Lord God to cal thee again the second, third, or more often times; What therefore shalt thou no

            But of the grace of graces, and of that Sacrament of al Sacraments, by which God woulde dwell amongst men, and giue himselfe for daily foode vnto them and remedy also, I can no wayes holde my tongue. Once was there offered vppon the Crosse a Sacrifice, and bloody host for our saluation; but in thys Sacrament hee is daily applyed vnto vs, for the remission of our sinnes. When soeuer you doe thys (sayth hee) doe it in remembrance of me. O monument of saluation, ô singuler Sacrament, ô gratefull mysterie, bread of lyfe; sweet nourishment; royall banquet; hauing in thee Manna, the sauour of all sweetnes.

tytles? Who may worthily eate thee? who may honor thee with due reuerence, and according to thy merrits? My hart faileth whē I thinke on thee; my tongue foultreth when I speak of thee; neyther can I report thy myracles according as I desire. If that bountifull Lorde had bestowed thys benefite on onely innocents, and those that are vntouched and chast of lyfe, as yet the gyft had beene inestimable: but nowe, what shall I say? when as to the end hee might impart himselfe vnto them, hee disdayneth not to passe by the handes of many most vngodly Ministers, whose soules are the dwelling houses of sathan, and bodies, the vessels of corruption: whose lyfe is consumed in vices and the sudds of sin? Moreouer, that he might visit his, and cōfort his friends, hee hath not refused to be handled with their de

If we are bounde to giue God thanks for the nutriment whereby our bodyes are sustained, howe much owe wee him for that our well-beeing is conserued? For wee prayse not a horse, because hee is a horse, but because hee is good; nor the wine because it is wine, but because it is good; neyther a man because he is a man, but because he is a good man.

If thou art tyed vnto him so much for the dowries of thy body, howe much owest thou for the gyfts of thy minde? if so much for the gyfts of nature, howe much for the gifts of grace?

            NOt without cause might a man ask this question, why amongst christians that belieue all these thinges, and confesse y• which hetherto hath beene spoken, there are found so many who neglecting vertues, follow vices? that euill hath not one only roote, but many & diuers. But amongst others, and they not the

least, is this; A certaine generall error in which the men of this world liue, beleeuing that all that which God promiseth to the louers of vertue; is reserued for the future life, and that in this present world none of these are to bee exspected. For which cause, whereas man dooth highly affect reward, and is chiefely drawne by profit, and is not moued but by things present; yea, and such things as are obiect to the exteriour sences: when he seeth nothing present, hee setteth light by that which is to come. So seemeth it that the Iewes did in the time of the Prophets. For when Ezechiell by the commaundement of God proposed vnto them great promises, or denounced vnto them dire commina
               
                  •
               ions, they hist, and after a contemptible sort disdained all things saying; The vision that this man seeth is of a long date,

                  Esay, 28. and said: Commaund, and recommaund▪ send, and send againe; exspect, and reexspect, exspect, and reexspect a little there▪
               
a little there. This is one of the chiefest reasons which calleth peruerse men from the obseruance of the commaundements of God, perswading thēselues that in this world there is no reward prefixed for vertue; but that all things are reserued for the world to come. This considered that great wise man, when he said;

I will not feed you: that that dieth, let it die; and that which is cut off,
                  Zach. 11. let it be cut off: and let the rest deuoure euery one of them the flesh of his neighbour. But this is most dangerous; For whereas the world is a stormy Sea, and as it were a De

               art full of thieues, & horrible beasts, whereas there are so many incommodities and misfortunes of mans life, whereas our enemies with whō we are to fight, are so many and so strong, when as there are so many hidden snares, so many traps laid, to conclude, so many & so great difficulties euery wayes scattered & sowed in our wayes: and a man is a creature so fraile, naked blind, vnarmed, feareful, and void of counsaile; 
                  •
               f the shadow and assistance of God faile, what can he poore weake one doe amongst so many strong? a Dwarfe amidst so many Gyants? blinde amidst so many snares? a
               
                  •
               one, and vnweaponed, amongst 
                  •
               o many Armed and strong enemies?
            God permitteth also that such should fall from one sinne into ano
               
                  •
               her, he suffereth them according to

the desires of their owne harts, that the causes of their damnation may be multiplied. Neyther is this the end of his euill:
                  Psal. 8. For it sufficeth not God, that he auerteth his eyes from the vniust and sinfull: and that hee permitteth them to fall into diuers errors and sorts of tribulation; but hee also sendeth them and armeth creatures against them: so that those eyes that were first opened for their profit, now watch for their perdition, as God saith by the Prophet; I will fixe mine eyes vppon them in euill,
                  Amos. 9. and not in good: Neither is there place wherein a man may hide himselfe from these eyes, as God testifieth at large in the same chapter. And how perilous it is to haue God incensed against vs, many examples doe teach vs.
            To this prouidence it appertayneth  to prouide men of all those necessary meanes, to the attainment of the finall end, which is beatitude, helping them in all their necessities, and creating in their soules, dispositions, vertues, and infused habites: which are all required to that ende. Of this number, the first is the grace

of the holy spirit, next after that prouidence, the beginning of all other priuiledges, and celestiall gifts. Now this grace is the participation of the diuine nature, that is, of goodnes, purity, and nobility of God himselfe, by whose helpe and meanes, a man casteth away from himselfe all vilenes, abiectnes, & inciuilitie, which hee receaued from Adam; and is made pertaker of the diuine nobilitie, putting off himselfe, and putting on Iesus Christ. Grace is the spirituall ornament of the soule, made by the handes of the holy Ghost, which maketh the soule so faire and gracious in Gods eyes, that hee receaueth the same for his daughter and his spouse. Of this ornament Esay boasteth;
                  Esay, 6. Reioycing (saith he) I will reioyce in our Lord, &c. The principall effect of grace, is to make the soule so gratefull and faire in Gods eyes, that hee chooseth the same for his daughter, his spouse his temple, his house, in which he delighteth himselfe with the sonnes of men. Another effect thereof is, not onely to adorne the soule, but also to strengthen it, by the meanes of

those vertues which proceede from the same, which are like Sampsons haires, in which con
                  •
               isted not onely his beauty, but his strength. Grace therfore armeth the whole man, and maketh him so strong (as S. Thomas saith;) That the least grace is sufficient to bind and ouercome all deuils, and all sinnes. It maketh also all actions, yea, euen those that are indifferent gratefull vnto God. It maketh vs the sonnes of God by adoption, and heires of the celestial Kingdome, worthy also to be registred in the booke of life. And to speake many things in a few words, Grace is that which maketh a man apt to all goodnes, that smootheth the way to heauen, that lightneth and maketh our Lords yoake easie vnto vs, that healeth our infirme nature; enfl
                  •
               meth our will, comforteth our memory, strengthneth our wit, moderateth the sensu
                  •
               l part, least it ouer-flow with offences: confirmeth the irefull, least it be slack and sluggish to doe well. Finally, it maketh God dwell in our soules, that dwelling in the same he might gouerne, defend, and direct the same

towards heauen. God therefore 
                  •
               itteth in our soules like a King in his Kingdome, a Generall in his Army, a Master in his Schoole, and a Shepheard in his Flocke, that hee may there exercise, and execute all spirituall offices▪ and all prouidence. Goe too therefore, if this so goodly a Margarite, from which so many benefites doe flowe, be a perpetuall companion of vertue, who would not willingly imitate that prudent Merchaunt in the Gospell, who solde all that hee hadde, that hee might get this one and onely treasure? This grace doe they all want, that are entangled, and perseuer in sinne.
            The thirde priuiledge, is a certaine speciall light, and supernaturall  wisedome, which GOD bestoweth on those who are iust, and which is deriued from grace: For the office therof, is to heale our weak nature. Euen as therefore hee healeth our will weakened by sinne, so also ought it to cure our vnderstanding, wholy obscured by the same sinne: That the vnderstanding may know what to doe, and the will may

haue power to doe that which hee now knoweth needfull to be done. Therefore the Prophet sai

                  •
               riuiledge appertaine the foure gifts of the holy Spirit▪ as are the gift of wisedome, w
                  •
               ich is giuen for the knowledge of diuine things. The gift of science, which is giuen that wee may vnderstand inferiour thinges: The gift of vnderstanding, by which we attaine the knowledge of the misteries of God: And the gift of coun
               
                  •
               aile▪ by meanes whereof wee conceaue the actions of this life, and in them how to gouerne what so euer shall encounter vs. But this knowledge is not so much speculatiue, as actiue: not so much contemplatiue, as practiue, neither is it giuen vs that we should vnderstand, but that wee should worke, not that wee should be subtill & ingenious in disputing, but that wee should be studious in enduring. And therefore it remayneth not only in the vnderstanding, a
                  •
                Sciences, which are acquired in Schooles, but by the vertue thereof

it mooueth the will, enclining the same to follow vertue. Of this Science Christ speaketh in the Gospell:
                  Iohn. 14. The holy Ghost which my Father sendeth in my name,
                  Iohn. 6. he shall teach you in all truth; and it is written in the Prophets: They shall bee all taught of God. They that pertake this celestiall gift, are not puffed vp with vaine glory in prosperity, nor amated in aduersity. For by the benefit of this light they see, of how small moment it is which the world can giue, or take away, if it be compared with those thinges which are in Gods power. The wise-man testifieth this, when he saith: A man setled in his wisedome,
                  Eccles. 27. abideth as the Sunne: The foole is changed like the Moone.
            This is that wisedome which the children of light enioy: but on the contrary side, the wicked liue in those horrible darks of Egipt, which may be felt with the handes. Of which thing the figure was; where it is said; That in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israell dwelt, there was light, and in Egipt for three dayes space so thick darknes,

that it might be felt, which represented that obscure night in which 
                  •
               inners liue, as they themselues confesse in Esay,
                  Esay, 5. sa
                  •
               ing: We haue exspected the light, and behold darknes▪ the cleare day, and beholde we haue walked in obscurity: We haue felt for the wall like blind men, and as it were without eyes wee haue groped about▪ wee haue stumbled at noone-dayes, as it were in darknes, and in misty▪ as it were the dead. For what greater blindnes can it be then to sell the right of first birth; that is, the heritage of the celestiall Kingdome, for a little pleasure of this worlde, then not to feare hell? not to aspire to heauen? not to hate sinne? not to remember the latter iudgement? to set light by the promises and threatnings of our Lord? not to remēber death which euery moment is imminent? not to prepare himselfe to yeeld an account? not to thinke that it is a momentarie thing which delighteth, and an eternall, which dooth excruciate? They knewe not (sayth the Prophet) neyther vnderstand,
                  Psa. 8. they walk 
                  〈◊〉
                darknes, and from darknes into

darknes shall they goe.
            The fourth priuiledge is the ioy of the holy Ghost: Of that knowledge  whereof wee spake before; wee sayd that it not onely relyed on the vnderstanding, but that it discended also to the will, where it poureth foorth her rayes, and spreadeth her light: So that the soule reioyceth▪ and after an vnspeakeable kind of manner comforteth her selfe in our Lorde. So that euen a
                  •
                the materiall light produceth of it selfe that heate which wee feele: so that spyrituall light createth in the soule of the iust man a spirituall ioy, of which we speak according to that of th
                  •
                prophet: The light is risen to the iust and reioycing to the vpright in hart.
                  Psal. 96. Many confesse that as in vices there are all kinds of euill, so in vertues there are al sorts of goodnes, only pleasure excepted, which diuers deny to be in the same. And wheras the hart of man desireth nothing more then pleasures, men had rather haue imperfect pleasure; then that which wanteth pleasure, with all the perfections thereof. But ô vnhappy man, if vertue haue not ioy

and delight in her, what is that which Dauid saith; How great a multitude of thy sweetnes haft thou hoorded vp for those that feare thee?
                  Psalm. 30.
            
            In which words the Prophet▪ not onely expresseth the greatnes of the sweetnes which is reserued for the godly, but also giueth a reason, why the wicked do not know the same: namely, because our lord hideth the same from theyr eyes. This sweet
                  •
               nes the godly especially pertake in theyr prayers; Neyther is thys ioy onely peculier to them that are perfect, but the younger souldiers also of Christ, and such as are newly entred into his seruice, haue their sweetnes, and find theyr ioyes in the way of our Lorde, as that sollemne day testifieth,
                  Luke. 15. appoynted by the Father for his prodigall sonne.
            The wicked are not pertakers of this ioy, for euen as he that hath his pallate corrupted with euill humors, tasteth not the sweetnes of the meat, (for that which is bitter he deemeth sweet, and that which is sweete, bitter,) So they that haue theyr soule corrupted with 
                  •
               uill and disordered humors, of vices and affections, and

so accustomed to the flesh-pots of Egipt, haue no feeling of the sweetnes of vertue, but thinke vice sweet, and vertue bitter.
            The fift priuiledge is the peace of  conscience; For a iust man feeleth no pricks or stinges of conscience, but reioyceth in the sweete flowers and fruites of vertue, which the holy Ghost hath planted in his soule, as it were a Paradise on earth, and a well cultiued garden, in which hee himselfe taketh delight. Of this tranquilitie S. Augustine speaketh after this manner. Thou that seekest this true rest (which after this life is promised to Christians) euen here maist thou tast the sweete thereof,
                  August. de Catichizand. arudit.
                amidst the most bitter molestations of this life, if thou louest his precepts that promised the same vnto thee. For thou shalt quickly perceiue, that ye fruites of 
                  •
               ustice, are sweeter then those of iniquity; and thou shalt more truly and contentedly enioy the goods of the conscience, amidst troubles, then of the euill, amongst delights. Hetherto S. Augustine.
            And truly, euen as honny, is not only sweet of it selfe, but also sweetneth

that which was before bi
                  ••
               er: so a good conscience is so iocond & merry: that it maketh all the troubles and tribulations of this worlde seeme delightfull. So great is the fruite and sweetnes of a good conscience; as S. Ambrose in his booke of O
                  •
               fices, is not afraid to say, that the beatitude of the iust in this life, consisteth in the same. His wordes are these. The brightnes of honesty is so great,
                  Ambros. lib. 2, Offici. lib. 2, Tus
                        •
                     ul. quest.
                that peace of conscience, and security of innocence, doe make a blessed life. The same vnderstood the Ethniques, amongst whom Cicero saith thus: A life led in honesty and vprightnes, bringeth so much consolation, that sicknes eyther toucheth not, or griefe of mind lightly attayneth those, who haue so liued. Bias demaunded; what in this life wanted feare; aunswered: A good conscience. And Seneca in a certaine Epistle, saith, It is neuer without ioy, and that proceedeth from a good conscience. By which it appeareth howe fitly the Phylosophers sentence accordeth with that of Salomon:
                  Prouerb. 15. All the dayes of the poore are euill, that is miserable;

a secure minde is like a perpetuall banquet. Contrariwise, the wicked liue in perpetuall feare and suspition. For euen as the conscience is the Maister of the godly, so is it the torture and heads man of the wicked, which afflicteth and inwardly tormenteth, and without intermission accuseth sinners of their wickednes committed, and mixeth wormewood amongst all theyr delights. For the turpitude of sinne, iniuries done vnto other men, infamy, incertayntie of life, feare of death, dread to yeeld account, and horrour of hel, like thornes do teare the har
                  •
                of a sinner, that when hee is alone he can neuer take comfort. So that it is well sayd by Isodore.
                  Lib. 2, Soliloq.
                The guilty soule is neuer secure; For an euill mind is alwayes afflicted with the stings of his owne conscience, then which punishment what is more greeuous? Here-vpon S. Ambrose: What more greeuous punishment thē wound of the inward conscience?
                  Ambros. in Offici.
                Is not this more to be esteemed then death? then losse? then banishment? then weakenes? then greefe is? which is so vnfainedlie

true,

                that the Ethniques also had knowledge thereof, as many the worthy writings of Seneca, Cicero, and others doe testifie.
            The sixt priuiledge is, the confidence and hope of vertue, in which  the iust liue, of which also the Apostle speaketh. Reioycing in hope, patient in tribulation. This is one of the principall treasures of Christian life: this is the possession and patrimony of the sonnes of God: this is the secure Hauen, and very remedy, of all the miseries of this life. For this cause the Prophet Dauid sayde thus.
                  Psal. 118. Remember (ô Lord) thy promises, in which thou gauest mee hope; this comforted mee in my humility. The effects of this hope are many & excellent. For it strengtheneth a man in the way of vertue, by the hope of rewarde, or recompence; For the more sure hee is of the pledge of this reward, the more willingly he runneth through what soeuer tribulations of this world, as with one voyce all the Fathers doe confesse. Euery worke (saith Saint Ierosme) is wont to become light, when as the recompence thereof is

thought vpon, and the hope of the rewarde becommeth the solace of the labour.
            The obtayning thereof doth not in the end onely strengthen vs, but it helpeth also in the midst thereof, yea in all necessity and worldly misery. By this a man is succoured in all tribulation, defended in perills, by th
                  •
               s he receaueth comfort in his calamities, help in his infirmities, sufficient in all his necessities. By this we obtaine the grace and mercy of our Lorde, which assisteth vs in euerie thing. Of this there are diuers testimonies in Scriptures, especially in the Psalmes.
                  Psal. 9, 30.39. Esay, 30. Eccles. 2. Prouerb. 3. Hope is as it were a secure Hauen, to which the iust doe direct their course, when-so-euer anie tempest of this world dooth assaile them; and like a strong shield wherein all our enemies darts are receaued without any wound.

                repaire, and take bread. It is that Tabernacle and that shaddowe which our Lord promiseth by Esay, that it should be to his elect a shelter in the heate of the day, and

a couert from the storme and raine, that is, from all aduersity and prosperity of this worlde. F
                  •
               nally, it is a medicine and common remedy for all our euils. For it is most certaine, that what soeuer we iustly, faithfully, and prudently hope from God, we shall receaue the same, so that it be necessary for our saluation and pertaine therevnto. Therefore Cyprian caleth the mercy of GOD an inexhaunst fountaine of goodnes,
                  Cypr. ad Donat. Epist. 2, lib. 2. and hope, or a vessell of confidence, wherein those benefites are contayned; and hee sayth, that according to the quantity of the vessell, the proportion of the remedy shall bee likewise correspondent. For in regard of the fountaine, the water of mercy shall neuer faile. Euery place sayth our Lorde to the chyldren of Israell, which the step of your foote shall tread vpon, I will giue you. So all the mercy vpō which a man shall settle his foote, shall be his.
            The wicked also haue a certaine hope, yet not a liuing but a deade hope, for sinne taketh away the lyfe thereof, & therfore their hope worketh not in them, the effects which

we haue aboue rehearsed. Of thys hope it is written; The hope of the wicked is like the downe that is tossed vp, & like the light foame which is scattered by the storme, & like the 
                  •
               moake which is dispersed by the winde. By which you may perceiue howe vaine the hope of the wicked is. And not onely is this hope vaine, but hurtfull, deceitfull, and dangerous also, as GOD warneth by the Prophet, Wo vnto you, you sonnes forsakers; that is, you that haue forsaken your Father, (saith our Lord) that you might doe counsaile, but not of me, &c. hoping for helpe in the strength of Pharao, and hauing trust in the shadow of Egypt. And Pharaos strength shall be confusion vnto you, & that which followeth: And in the chapter which foloweth, Woe to you that descende into Egipt for help, hoping in your horses. &c. You see heere, that the hope of the wicked, is flesh, of the good, spirit; the one of them to bee nought els then man, the other to be God: So that what difference there is between god & man, the same is there founde betweene hope and hope.

What difference there is betweene both the hopes, the Prophet Ieremie aptly describeth, Chapter 17. Cursed (saith hee) is the man, that trusteth in man, &c: And after hee hath expounded this malediction, he opposeth the blessing of the righteous. Blessed (saith he) is the man that trusteth in our Lord &c.
            ¶ Of these sixe fore-sayde Priuiledges, and their contraries hath he entreated, lib 1, part, 2 of the Guide of a sinner, Chapters 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18.
         
         
            
            
               The Argument.
               The riches of vertue are not circumscribed within these priuiledges only, but they haue also other six annexed vnto them, no lesse valuable thē the former, as are. That it maketh the man in whom it abideth, possessor of the true liberty of th

That all good things are bestowed on the godly, which are any wayes necessary in this life: That the death of the righteous, is pleasant, blessed, & peaceable: to which goods so many euils are opposed, which make the life of dissolute men, miser

            CHAP. 15.
            THe seauenth priuiledge of Vertue is, the true liberty of the minde, of which the Apostle speaketh: Where the Spirit of our Lord is, there

is liberty. Thys liberty our Lorde promised the Iewes, when he sayd; If you shall continue in my sayings,
                  Iohn. 8. you shall truly be my disciples, and you shall knowe the truth, and the truth shall deliuer you, that is, shall giue you true liberty. They answered h
                  •
               m; We are the seed of Abraham, and we haue not as yet serued any man, how sayst thou then, yee shall be free? Iesus answered & said vnto them; Verily, verily, I say vnto you; Euery one that doth sin, is the slaue of sin, now the seruant remaineth not in the house for euer, but the sonne remaineth for euer. If therfore the Son hath deliuered you, you shal be truly free.
            In which words there is a double liberty insinuated, a false, and a true. The false is theyrs who haue theyr body free, but their soule captiue, & subiect to the tyrannie of their own passions and sinnes, such as was that of Alexander the great, who beeing King of the whole worlde, was a slaue to his owne appetites and vices.
            The true, is of those which haue theyr mindes voyde of all tho
                  •
               e tyrants,

although they haue theyr bodie sometimes free, somtimes thrale and captiue. Such as was that of the Apostle Saint Paule; who although he were captiue, and held in bonds, yet in spirit he flew thorow the heauens, and by the doctrine of his Epistles, se
                  •
                at liberty the whole world. This true liberty is of those that follow vertue; but the false is of those that lye drowned in vice and sin.
            ¶ Of this liberty of the good, & thraldome of the wicked, there is a most excellent and copious treatise, in the first booke of the Guide of a sinner, part 2. chap. 19. to which place we refer the Reader.
            The eyght priuiledge, is the peace  of the interior man, which the studious in ver
                  •
               ue doe enioy. Now it 
                  •
               s to be noted, that there ar
                  •
                three sorts of peace. The one with our neighbour,
                  Psalm. 119. of which Dauid speaketh, when he sayth; I was peaceable with those that hated peace, when I spake vnto them, they im
               
                  •
               ugned mee without a cause. Another peace is with GOD, of

which the Apostle sayth; Being iustified therefore by fayth, let vs haue peace with GOD.
                  Rom, 5. The thyrd is, that which a man hath with himselfe.
            Nowe, that I say thus, let no man admire, for it appeareth, that in one and the same man, there are founde
                  •
                two men, and they contrary the one against the other; as are the interior and exterior; or the spirit and flesh; the appetite and reason. VVhich contrarietie, not onely combatteth the minde with cruell assaults, but troubleth the whole man also with his passions, ardent desires and raging hunger. The godly therefore hauing grace the gouernour of a
                  ••
                their sences & appetites, and all their wil resigned into the hands of god, are not by any encounter so perturbed, as that they loose theyr interior peace. This peace is promised by our Lord, to the louers of vertue, by the kingly prophet, when he sayth; Great is the peace of those that loue thy lawe,
                  Psalm. 118. and no blame or scandale may befall thē. And in Esay, would to God thou hadst kept my commaundements,
                  Esay. 4. thy peace had been

like a riuer, & theyr iustice, like the waues of the sea. But what peace this is, may rather be vnderstood by the practize then speculation; For the iust man knoweth, howe much his hart differeth now when he serueth God, from that which he bare about him, when he was cōuersant in the world: For then, in all perrill of tribulation hee was suddainlie afrayde, he trembled, in hart and bodie he feared: But after hee left the world, and translated his hart to the loue of celestiall things, and planted all his hope in God, he ouer-passeth all things what soeuer chance, with a quiet hart subiected to Gods will. All the perturbations of his minde, as if dead, are at rest, neyther is hee prouoked by any affections: The inferior part of the minde, is obedient, the superior gouerneth, & that in great peace & exelent order.
            But the wicked and sinners, are alwayes in warre, contention, and perturbation: for while on the one side they are depriued of grace, which is as it were a bytte restrayning theyr passions and mortifying them; & on the other side, so vnbrideled

and disordered by their appetites, and dissolute affections, as they scarce know what it is to resi
                  •
               t any vice. They liue in infinite de
               
                  •
               ires of diuers thinges: Some of honours, some of dignities, som of riches, some of marriage; & other likewise are mooued with other pleasures & concupisences. For the appetite is as it were a fire, which neuer cryes enough, or as a deuouring beast, that is neuer satisfied, & as it were a horseleach,
                  Prou. 30. which hath two young ones, saying; Bring, bring.
            This blood-sucker, is the vnsatiable appetite of our hart, whose two daughters are Necessitie and Cupiditie, whereof the one is as it 
                  •
               ere a tru thirst, the other as it were a false; neither dooth the one afflict lesse the the other, although the one bee true necessity, the other false Hence it is, yt neither rich nor pore, (if they bee wicked) haue any true peace or quiet, for these mens harts are solicited by desire, the other, with continuall necessity, saying; Bring, bring. What peace therefore can a man haue, being sollicited by these

two, and importuned for in
                  •
               inite th
                  •
               nges, which are not in his power? What quiet can the mother haue, which hath rounde about her many hungry children, crying thorowe neede, and asking breade, and 
                  •
               hee not hauing where-with to satisfie them?
            The ninth priuiledge of vertue is, because God heareth the prayers of  the iust, & this is a most famous cō
               fort vnto them and helpe also, in all necessity and misery of this world, which is so great, that amongst all liuing creatures, there is none more miserable thē man is, who is exposed to a thousand infirmities, chaunces, necessities and dolors▪ as well of the mind as of ye body. That which is past, hee greeueth at; that which is present, afflicteth him; that which is to come, terrifieth him; and that he may sustaine himselfe with a litle morsel of bread, he must often labor all his life time.
            This one thing did so much afflict those wise men in time past with so much tediousnes, that among them there is one to be founde, that was not afrayd to say, that hee doubted

whether Nature were our mother, or rather our step-dame, which hath subiected vs to so many miseries. Which beeing so, what remedy (I pray you) hath hee left, who punished man-kind so greeuously? Tel me, what remedy hath a man, weak and lame, that sayling by sea, with one misfortune looseth al his riches? I know what thou wilt say; if thou sayst hee hath not where-vpon to liue, neither that by reason of infirmitie he can labour for his liuing, it must needes be that hee must beg: neyther hath a man other remedie left him, then like a poore begger to cry at the gate of our Lord. But thou wilt perchance aske me, whether this remedy be vniuersal, for euery necessity of our life? To thys (since it wholy dependeth on gods wil) I can aunswere nought els, but that God chose vnto himselfe, to this end, witnesses & secretaries, such as are the Apostles and Prophets, amongst whom one sayth; There is not another so great a Nation,
                  Deut. 4. that haue theyr gods so fauourable to them, as our Lorde God is assistant to all our obsecrations. When therfore

we do pray, although we see no man that answereth vs, yet speak we not vnto the walls, but god himselfe is present with vs, who heareth and helpeth vs when we pray, hauing cō
               passion of our necessities, and preparing the remedy. What therefore more greater comfort may it be to him that praieth, then to haue assurance of so certain a presence. And if this be sufficient to comfort thē that pray, how much shall those thinges confirme them, which Christ himselfe speaketh, saying; Aske & you shall haue,
                  Math, 9, seeke & you shall finde, knocke and it shall be opened vnto you. What more precious & certain figne may we haue thē that is? who will call these words into question? who will not be refreshed with thys sollace in all his prayers? whom wil not so royall letters-patents satisfie?
            Contrariwise, of the prayers of the wicked it is said. When you shal lift vp your hands,
                  Esay. 18, I wil turne mine eyes from you, and when you shall multiply your prayers, I will not heare you.
                  Iob. 27. And in the booke of Iob, For what hope hath the hypocrite, if he greedily take other mens goods, if

God deliuer not his soule? Shal god heare his cry, when trouble shal fall vpon him? A thousand & more of such like authorities, might be collected from the sacred Scriptures, by which may bee gathered, that the godly are handled and heard like chyldren, but the vngodly reuerted like enemies.
            The tenth priuiledge of vertue is,  that God helpeth the righteous in whatsoeuer theyr tribulations: For to the louers of vertue, there is a strength and fortitude giuen, that with ioy they may sustaine theyr tribulations, which shall neuer fayle them in this life. For we know, that there is not a sea so stormie in thys world, neyther an Euripus so instable as our life is. For in it there is not founde any felicity so secure, which is not subiect to a thousand kinde of casualties, lying in wayt
                  •
                to indanger vs euery moment. And it is a thing woorthy of consideration to see, with howe great difference the good and euill sort, doe passe ouer thys mutable Worlde. For the vertuous doe assuredly knowe, that they haue GOD for

theyr Father, and that it is hee that enioyneth them to taste thys cuppe, like a certaine medicine prescribed by a most expert and cunning Phisition. And that tribulation is as it were a refining or polishing, which the more sharper it is, so much the more pure and brighter dooth it make the soule, and clen
                  •
               eth away all corruption: and therefore they cast downe theyr heades, and are humbled like young children in the time of tribulation.
            But if at any time the labour increase, the help of the diuine grace, is presently at hand, that neuer forsaketh the iust in time of tribulation. For GOD himselfe (as his holy worde witnesseth) is neuer more neere the faythfull, then in the time of theyr tribulation, although it seemeth quite contrary.
            Reade and ouer-reade the sacred Scriptures, and thou shalt finde that there is scarcely any thing that is so often repeated & promised in them, as that which we heare speak of. Is it not writt
                  •
               n of GOD, that he is our helper in necessities, and tribulations? Is it not hee that inuiteth

vs, that in time of tribulation wee should call vppon him? Call vppon mee (sayth hee) in the time of tribulation,
                  Psalm. 49. and I will deliuer thee, and thou shalt honour me.
            Dooth not the prophet (hauing experience heereof,) testifie the same? When I did inuocate (sayth hee) the Lorde of my iustice hearde mee,
                  Psalm. 4. in tribulation thou hast comforted mee. Hence it is that wee reade, that the Saints beeing verie often circumuented with many perills, and temptations, remained immoouable, and vnconstant in mind, and of a pleasant & merry looke & gesture: for they knewe they had present with them, that faythfull custodie which neuer had forsaken them: which is euen then most of all present, when dangers are grown to theyr vttermost.
            Of thys those three holy young men had a feeling, when king Nabuchodonozer commaunded them to bee cast into the burning fornace in Babylon. To thys is annexed, the help & fauour of all vertues, which at that tyme concurre, toward the strengthening of the afflicted mind.

For euen as when the hart is vexed, all the blood from euery part in the body, hath recourse there-vnto, to succour it least it fayle; So when the soule is ouer-pressed with griefe and anguish, all the vertues do presently concurre, and help, her now thys way, straight another way: Fayth is at hand, bringing with her a cleere knowledge of the good & euill that followeth after thys lyfe: Hope likewise commeth, which maketh a man patient in tribulation, in expectation of reward. Charitie draweth nie, with the loue whereof a man beeing inflamed, he desireth to suffer all kindes of affliction. Obedience, and the conformitie of our will with Gods wil, approche, from whose handes a man receaueth with gladnes, and without grudging, whatsoeuer is giuen. These, and other such like, are the cause that the godly in theyr tribulations, are patient, and magnanimious: Yea, that willingly they seeke out affliction; saying with S. Bernard, Giue mee (ô Lord) tribulation, that thou mayst bee alwayes with mee.
            
               Contrariwise, the wicked in that they haue neither charity, nor fortitude, nor hope, because tribulations finde them vnarmed and vnprepared, and for that they want the light▪ by meanes whereof they may see that which the godly beholde by a liuely faith: neyther by experience haue proued that wonderfull goodnes, and fatherly prouidence of God where-with hee respecteth his seruants, when tribulations are at hand: They are cruell to themselues and inhumane, they neglect the glory of our Lorde, blaspheme his name, scandale his prouidence, detrac
                  •
                from his iustice, curse his mercy, and open theyr sacrilidgious mouthes agaynst heauen, and his Maiestie, Hence it falleth out, that calamities at last doe raigne into their houses, & their miseries are doubled, which God inflicteth vpon them for their so many blasphemies. For this reward doth hee deserue that spetteth in Gods face, and will kick against the prick.
            
                The eleuenth priuiledge is, that God doth also impart to those that followe vertue, temporall and necessarie

benefits for the sustentation of their life, which is approoued by that of Salomon. The length of dayes is in his right hand, that is,
                  Pro. 3. his 
                  •
               ertue; and in his left hand, ritches and glory. So that vertue hath two kindes of good to inuite a man▪ on the right hand, eternall; on the left, temporall. Doe not thinke that God leaueth his seruaunts so, as they die for hunger; neyther that hee is so improuident, and negligent, that whereas hee giueth foode in due season to Ants and Wormes, he will leaue men, that day and night serue in his house, consumed with hunger, and made leane vvith want. By this rewarde the Psalmist dooth inu
                  •
               te vs to vertue, saying: Feare our Lorde, all yee his Saints, because there is no necessitie that can happen to those that feare him: The ritch haue wanted and haue beene hungry,
                  Psal. 33. but they that seeke after our Lorde, shall want no good thing. If thou seekest more testimonies, reade the sixth of Mathew, and the eight and twentieth of Deuteronony. But if perhaps any one shall say that those promises in Deuteronomy,

are rather made to the Iewes then the Christians, (for to these are greater thē temporall promises made, namely the goods of grace & glory,) let him know, that euen as God in that 
                  Heb. 7.16. carnall lawe, denied not the Iewes that were iust, spirituall thinges; so neither in the spirituall law, wil he with-hold temporall blessings from those that are good Christians. For this is the law of the couenant and promise which God made twixt man and himselfe, that man shoulde obserue his commaundements, and GOD likewise should procure for him, those things that were necessary, & take care of him: neither will God euer violate this couenaunt. For if man bee a faithfull seruaunt vnto God, GOD also will be a faithfull Lord and patron vnto man. This is that one thing that God said was necessarie;
                  Luke. 10. namely, to knowe, to loue, and to serue God: for this one thing being obserued, the rest are in safety. Pietie (saith S. Paule) is profitable to all thinges,
                  Tim. 4. hauing the promises of life present and to come. See (I pray you) howe manifestly Paule heere

promiseth to Piety, not onely the goods of eternall life, but temporall also.
            But if any man will knowe howe great the aduersity and pouerty of the vngodly is, let him reade the 28▪ chapter of Deutronomy, and he shal there finde those things which shall both breed admiration in him, and strike feare into his hart: Neyther are these comminations vaine, or inuented to terrifie men: but are rather true prophecies, whose trueth very often the after euent hath approued. The siege of Samaria vnder King Achab, the destruction of the Citty of Ierusalem vnder Titus, doe both testifie, that nothing in that chapter of Deutronomy is spoken in vaine. Neyther let any man thinke that these thinges are onely spoken to the Iewes: for they pertayne vnto all men that haue the knowledge of Gods law, and those likewise that transgresse the same, as GOD testifieth by the Prophe
                  •
               . Haue I not (saith he) caused the people of Israel to ascend from the Land of Egipt, & the Palestines from Capadocia, the Sirians frō Cirene? Behold,

the eyes of our Lord are vppon the Kingdome, which is full of wickednes, and I will grinde them from the face of the earth. The diuers slaughters and ruines of Kingdomes & Empires inferred in times past in the Christian world,
                  Amos, 7. by the Hunes, Gothes, and Vandales, testifie no lesse.
            
                The twelfth and last priuiledge of vertue, is, the pleasing and glorious death of the Saints. For what is more glorious, then the death of the iust? Precious (sayth the Psalmist) is the death of the Saints,
                  Psal. 115. in the sight of our Lord. And Ecclesiasticus:
                  Ecclesiast. 1. In extreamity all thinges shal be well to those that feare God, and in the day of his death hee shall be blessed.
            VVhat greater hope and confidence may bee wished for, then that of blessed Saint Martine? Who vppon the instant of death, espying the enemie of mankinde: Cruell beast (sayeth hee) why standest thou nigh mee: Cruell as thou art, thou shalt finde nothing in me, for the bosome of Abraham shall receaue me in peace. So the iust feare

not death, nay, rather they reioyce in theyr departure, prayse God, and in as much as in them lyeth, giue h
                  •
               m thanks for their end: for by the benefit of death they are deliuered from all theyr labours; and begin to tast the first fruites of theyr felicitie.
            Of these (sayeth Saint Augustine:
                  In Epistola Iohann
                        •
                     s.
               ) Hee that desireth to be dissolued, and to be with Christ, dyeth not patiently, but lyueth patiently, and dyeth delightfully. The iust man therefore hath no cause to lament, or feare death, nay rather, it is to be sayd of him, that lik
                  •
                the Swanne, hee dyeth singing, gyuing glory to GOD that callet
                  •
                him.
            But the death of sinners is most wretched (sayth the Prophet) for it is euill in the loosing of the worlde,
                  Psal. 115. woorse in the seperation from the flesh, and woorst of all, in the double contrition of the woorme and fire (layeth Saint Bernard.) This is the last and not the least euill, as vvell of the boddie as of the soule. For it is harde to leaue the worlde, harder to forsake the body,

hardest to be tormented in hell fire. These, and other such like infinite euills doe torment sinners in the houre of their death, which make theyr end, troublesome, disquiet,

            ¶ Of all these thinges the Author entreateth very largely, lib. 1, Guide of a sinner, chap. 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, truly most worthy the reading and obseruation.
         
         
            
               ¶ The conclusion of all those thinges which hetherto haue beene spoken of the priuiledges of vertues.
            
            CHAP. 16.
            THou hast heard therfore my brother, which, and of what kind those twelue priuiledges be, which are graunted to vertue in this life; which are as it were twelue excellent and woorthy fruites of that tree, which S. Iohn saw in the Apocalips: which was so planted by a flood, bearing twelue fruites, euery moneth yeelding his seuerall fruite. For what other thing may this tree be, next

the sonne of God, then vertue it selfe, which yeeldeth the fruite of holines and life? And what other fruites thereof are there then those which wee haue reckoned vp in all this part? For what fruite is more pleasant to the sight, then the fatherly prouidence whereby GOD preserueth his, the deuine grace, the light of wisedome, the consolation of the holy Spirit, the ioy of a good conscience, a good euent of hope, the true liberty of the soule, the interiour peace of the hart, to be heard in our prayers, to be helpt in tribulations, to be prouided for in our necessities: Finally, to be assisted, and to receaue ghostly consolation in death? Euery one of these priuiledges is truly so great in it selfe, that if it were plainely knowne, it should suffice man to loue and embrace vertue, and amende his life: and it should also bring to passe that a man should truly vnderstand, how wel it is said by our Sauior; Whosoeuer forsaketh the worlde for Gods sake,
                  Math. 19. shall receaue a hundreth fold in this lyfe, and possesse lyfe eternall.
            
               Beholde therefore (my brother) what a benefit it is that heeretofore I haue declared vnto thee, see whervnto I inuite thee, Consider if any man will say thou art deceaued, if for the loue thereof, thou shalt leaue the worlde, and all that is therein. One onely inconuenient hath this good (if it may be termed an inconuenient) by reason it is vnsauorie to the reprobate; namely, because it is vnknowne vnto him. For this cause (sayth our Sauiour) the Kingdome of heauen is like vnto a treasure that is hidden: For this good is a very treasure in deede but hidden; not to those that possesse it, but to others. The Prophet very well acknowledged the price of this treasure, who said: My secret to my selfe,
                  I
                        •
                     say, 24. my secret to my selfe: Little cared he whether other men knew his treasure or no. For this good is not as other goods are, which are not goods, vnlesse they be knowne by others: for which cause they are not goods of themselues, but only in the opinion of the world, & therfore it is necessary that they be known of him, that by that meanes they may

be called goods. But this good maketh his possessour good & blessed, and no lesse warmeth his hart, when 
                  〈◊〉
                only knoweth it himselfe, then if all the world knew it. But my tong is not the key of this secret deske, much lesse of all those things which hetherto haue been spoken, for what so euer may be spoken by humane tongue, is much lesse & abiect then the truth of the thing it selfe. The key is the diuine light, and the experience, & vse of vertues. This will I that thou ask at Gods hands, & thou shalt find this treasure, yea God him selfe, in whō thou shalt find al things; & thou shalt see with how great reason the Prophet said; Blessed is the people whose God is our Lord,
                  Psal. 143. For what can he want that is in possession of this good? It is written in the book of the kings, that Helcanah the father of Samuel, said vnto his wife that bewailed her selfe because shee was barren & had no children; Anna why weepest thou?1, Reg▪
                   1. and why doost thou not eate? and wherfore is thy hart troubled? am not I better vnto thee then ten sonnes? well then, if a good husband which is to day, & tomorrow

Consider how that Merchaunt in the Gospell ioyfully sould all that which he had, that he might buy the field in which he had found the treasure: wherefore therfore doth not a Christian contende hearing this name, to know what it is? Truly it is a thing to be wondred at: If some toy-boaster should assure thee, that in thy house, and in such a place, a treasure were hidden, thou wouldest not cease to digge, and seeke, and prooue, if that were true which hee saide.

               he stroake of an Aspis there is no

By death therefore these vices are ended, although (if we will confesse▪ the t
                  •
               uth) wee cannot truly say that they are ended by death; for they endure alwayes, for which cause Iob also saith: And with him shall they sleepe in the dust. The reason heereof is, because that by the continuance of the olde custome, (which now is conuerted into another nature,)

               he appetite of vices is nowe already rooted in the verie bones and marrow of the soule, in no other sort then a consumption, which is fixed in the bowels of a man, excluding all cure, and admitting no medicine. The same doth our Sauiour shew in the resussitation of Laz

               culty, which the deferring of repentance and conuersion bringeth with it: and that by how much longer the repentance is deferred, by so much it is made more difficult.

               The Argument.
               Penitence is not to be deferred, till the end of our liues: for then is fauour hardly obtayned at Gods hands, and death is most dangerous; For he that hath liued euilly, dyeth worse, since according to the workes, the rewards are also a

                content with the misdeeds of the time past; but they perseuer in the same to the end of their lyues, and reserue their repentance till the houre of theyr deathes. O time to be feared? o terme perrilous: And doost thou persvvade thy selfe for so small a price, to purchase the Kingdome of heauen, and that thou canst so easily attaine the seate of the Angells? Seest thou not yt whatsoeuer is done in that houre, is more of necessitie, then of will? is done rather by compulsion, then liberty, and proceedeth rather from feare, then loue;

and although of loue, yet not of the loue of GOD, but of selfe-loue, whose property is to feare detriment, and to flie incommodity? Seest thou not that it is contrarie to the lawe of iustice, that hee that hath enthralled him selfe all the course of his life, to the seruice of the deuill, in the end should come vnto GOD, and require rewarde at his handes. Remembrest thou not those fiue foolish Virgines, of whom Christ speaketh in the Gospell, which then began to prepare theyr account, when it was to be iustified? What other euent is to be exspected by thee, if after thou art admonished by this example, thou perseuer in this thy negligence and carelesnes? God trulie can when hee will inspire true repentance into thee, but howe often dooth hee it in that houre?

               The Argument.
               No man ought to abuse Gods mercie, nor vnder the hope thereof, perseuer in sinne, for if the same mercie doe so patiently suffer so many Insidells in this worlde, and euill Christians in the Church, it will also suffer those that sinne

                  o bee damned.
            
            CHAP. 19.
            AND if thou say that the mercy of God is great, and that it comforteth thee so much, that perseuering in thy peruerse and wicked lyfe, thou trustest, that thou shalt be 
                  •
               aued; I pray thee what sin may be more haynous? Thou sayst that the mercie of God is immeasurable, for he would lyke an offender, be crucified for sinners; I confesse it ve
               
                  ••
               ly to be great, for it suffereth thee to breake out into this cursed blasphemie; such as is this, that thou wilt that his bounty should fauour

thy iniquity, thou shouldst take his crosse, which hee apprehended, as a meane that the kingdome of sinne might be destroyed, thou takest it as a meane, whereby sinne may be protected and defended: and where thou owest him a thousand e liues, if thou hadst so many, because hee sacrificed vp his life for thee: there catchest thou an occasion also to deny him that life which thou hast, nay rather, that which thou receauedst from him. Our Sauiour more greeueth at this, then the death it selfe which he suffered for thee: for hee that lamenteth not in his death, complaineth greeuously of thy sins by the Prophet, saying: Vpon my backe haue sinners built,
                  Psal. 111. they haue prolonged their iniquity. Tell me (I pray thee) who taught thee so to argue, that by reason that God is good, thou shouldst conclude that it is lawfull for thee to follow sinne and iniquity▪ The holy ghost seemeth to con

               . And because

God is good, it is reason also that man should be goode, and hope in him: who when hee is a most grieuous sinner, is ready to receiue him into grace, if with all his hart he conuert himselfe vnto him. Because God is good, and so good, truly it is a double sinne to offende so great a goodnes. Therefore by how much the more thou amplifiest the goodnes of God, by so much the more doost thou make hainous thy sinne which thou committest against him. Nowe is it requisite, that so greeuous a sinne should bee punished: for such is the nature and office of the diuine iustice (which as thou thinkest is not opposite, but a sister and reuenger of the Diuine bounty) that it cannot leaue so enormous an iniury vnpunished.
            P
                  •
               rseuering therfore in thy sinne, thinke not that thou hast any interest in the mercy of God but rather that his iustice attendeth thee, & innumerable others. Heare I pray you what the diuine mercy winketh at, and suffereth. Thou canst not deny me, that of a hundred parts of thys worlde, there is but one of them

christian, and of ninety nine others, there is not one of them to bee saued. For it is without all question, that euen as without the Arke of Noe in the time of the D
                  •
               luge, no man was saued, neyther out of the house of Rahab in the Citty of Iericho; so no man can be saued that is founde out of the house of God, which is his church.
            But beholde that part which is made famous by the name of the christians, and see in what estate the Christian affaires doe stande in thys most corrupt world, and thou wilt confesse, that in this misticall body, that from the sole of the foote, vnto the crowne of ye head, there is scarcly any member to be found, that is sound. Choose any one that best liketh thee, of those famous citties, in which the steps of pure & sincere religion and doctrine are yet extant; Run afterward thorow all the lesser citties, villages, and castles, in which there is scarce any memor
                  •
                of religion left, and thou shalt finde the people, of whom that of Ieremy may truly bee affirmed: Walke about the wayes of Ierusalem, and

behold and consider, and seeke thorowe the streetes thereof, whether you finde a man dooing iudgment, and seeking fayth, that is, a truly iust man, and I will bee mercifull vnto him. Walke likewise not onely the Tauerns and publique places, for they for the most part, are dedicated to lyes, trifles, and deceits, looke into the houses of thy neighbours, (as Ieremie did) & thou shalt know that there is no man that speaketh good,
                  Chap. 2. neyther shalt thou heare ought else but murmures, lyes, cursings, othes, & blasphemies. There is no man that repenteth himselfe of his sinne, saying: What haue I done?
            To conclude, thou shalt in effect finde, that the harts and tongues of men, are imployed in no other thinges, then earthly and priuate commodities, neyther shalt thou heare GOD any otherwise named, but in othes and blasphemies, in which they abuse gods name; which memory of his name, God cōplayneth of by the same prophet, saying, They remember me, but not as they ought, swering vntruly by my name.
            
               So that by the exterior signes, it is scarely knowne, whether this people be Christian, or gentile: except it be after the maner that we know bells▪ which are seene a farre of, but are knowne by their sounde: So mayst thou knowe them by theyr othes and blasphemies, which are meerely heard; the rest can neyther be knowne nor iudged.
            But (I pray you) howe may such be numbred amongst the rancke of those of whō Esay speaketh; Whosoeuer shall see them, shall knowe them, because these are the seede which God blessed. And if the lyfe of Christians ought to bee such, that they that behold them a far, shoulde iudge them to be the sonns of God, in what place ought they to be reckoned, who rather seeme to bee scoffers, deprauers, deceauers, and contemners of God, then true christians?
            All these things are more amply discoursed by mee, that thou mayst vnderstand that if (notwithstanding the mercy of God which thou pretende
                  •
               t) GOD permitteth so many infidells▪ and so many euill Christians

to be in his Church, and so many of the infidels and euill Christians to perrish, that hee permitteth not thee also to perrish with them, whose lyfe thou doost imitate. Dyd the heauens perhaps reioyce vppon thy byrth, or doe the iudgements of God, and the lawes of the gospel then cease, that the worlde may be one to thee, and other to another man? If therefore notwithstanding mercy, hell 
                  •
               e so dilated, & so many thousand soules are daily swallowed vp by the same, shal thy soule onely be excluded therfrom, if thou perseuer in thy sinnes?
            What if wee referre hether also those terrible examples of diuine iustice, which are found in Scripture: namely, the fall of Angels, the ruine of Adam, and those thinges which succeeded the same to wit, payne and misery? If we induce the whole earth drowned by the deluge, those fiue Citties consumed by fire and brimstone, Dathan & Abiron, swallowed vp by the earth aliue? If Nadab and Abihu, and out of the new Testament, wee adde the suddaine death of Ananias and Saphira, to the

precedent, what wilt thou thinke? what wilt thou say? what canst thou expect from the diuine mercy, perseuering in thy sin? But least thou shouldst say, that God was seuere & cruell in times past, but now merciful and peaceable, consider that with this affability & clemency also, hee suffereth al yt which thou hast heard, neither shalt thou bee exempted or free from these, but that thy punishment also shall attende thee, albeit thou art called a Christian, if so be thou art found a sinner. Shall God therfore loose his glory, because hee condemneth thee? Hast thou I pray thee, any thing singuler in thee, for which cause God should forbeare thee aboue any others, with all thy good & euil manners? or hast thou som immunity which others haue not, by reason of which hee should not condemne thee with the rest, if thou be no lesse euil then they are? Consider (I pray thee) the sonnes of Dauid, to them, for the many & singuler vertues of their Father, many priuiledges were promised, yet neuerthelesse, God woulde not leaue their sinnes vnpunished: for which

cause, some of thē, had an euil end. Where is therefore thy vaine hope? why doost thou vainly trust, considering their ouer-throwe, that thou pertaking theyr sinnes, shalt not be damned? Thou art deceiued my brother, thou art deceiued, if thou thinkest that is to hope in GOD. This is not hope, but presumption. For it is hope to trust, that God will forgiue all thy sinnes, and receaue thee into fauour, if thou art penitent, and forsake thy euill wayes, although thou art wicked and abhominable: but it is presumption that thou shalt be saued and blessed, in perseuerance of thy sinnes. Thinke thou that it is no small fault, for it is numbred amongst those, that are committed against the holy ghost. For hee that presumeth after thys manner, staineth the diuine bounty with no small iniury and ignominy, which in especiall are attributed to the holy Spirit. But these sinnes, (as witnesseth our Sauiour) are neyther forgiuen in thys world, nor in the world to come.
         
         
            
            
               The Argument.
               The excusation that the loue of the world is cause of sinne, is false, and inuented by a carnall Christian, who hath not tasted spiritual good, and therefore neglecteth and contemneth the same which are good indeede, and embraceth those that are false, fraile, and temporall & which he knoweth not himselfe. For if he knew them, hee should trulie perceiue how light th
                     •
                  y are, & how vnworthy to be esteemed. Contrariwise, how profitable the spirituall are, and how much to be beloued.
            
            CHAP. 20.
            BVt perchance thou wilt say, that the loue of thys world, & the thinges that are therein, haue captiuated thy hart▪ and led thee from the way of iustice. Thys is the excuse of a man that hath not tasted spirituall benefites, & therefore these carnal goods are so much esteemed by him. The clowne thinketh, that there is nothing more precious then his cottage,

because hee hath neuer seene the proude and stately buildings of great citties. The infant, issuing out of his mothers wombe, mourneth and weepeth, because hee knoweth not that the world is far more better that hee entreth into, then the prison from whence he issueth. The men of former times highly esteemed their cottages made of turffe, and couered with straw, before they saw more substantiall buildings. To all these may carnall men bee compared, who neuer saw or had experience of the spirituall goods, neyther tasted the sweetnes, dignity, nobility, and beauty of the same; and therefore they more esteeme these false and fraile benefites (which indeede are nothing lesse) then the spirituall, which are onely thought worthy the name of benefites. For if they had knowne them, it could not be, but that they should despise those that are 
                  •
               arnall, according to that of the prophet: And thou shalt destroy thy siluer grauen plates, and thy garment made of gold, & thou shalt disperse thē, like the menstruous cloth of a woman, go out shal
                  •
               
               
thou say thereto. Euen as therefore men haue cast away their false gods, after they acknowledged the true God, they also shall cast away and despise the false goods of this world, euen presently, as soone as they shal taste the true and celestiall goods. For as soone as a man hath tasted the sweetnes of spiritual things (saith Saint Bernard) he despiseth the flesh, (that is, all the goods and pleasures of this world:) and thys is the principall reason of this error, which so much blindeth the men of thys world.
            Besides this errour, there is another, namely, that men not onelie knowe not spirituall thinges but are also vtterly ignorant of temporall. For it is impossible that they should loue those temporall goods & pleasures in such sort, if they had the true knowledge of the spirituall. Tell mee (I pray thee) what is the World, with all that which is in it? (if wee diligently pry into the same, and obserue the fallacies thereof, together with his weapons and manner of proceeding,) What other thing (I say) is it? but a den of dolors

               The Argument.
               That the way of our Lord, is no more hard and difficult, but made plaine and easie by Christ and his benefites: namely, his Passion, Resurrection, and Ascention: as also indeuouring in the same, wee are assisted by the holy ghost.
            
            CHAP. 21.
            THere are some that excuse themselues, saying, that the way of our Lord is straite & difficult, because in the same there are diuers difficult precepts, and such as are contrarie to humane affection and appetite. This is one of the most principall excuses which sluggish and slothfull men, infer in this affayre.

            Imagine thy selfe (my brother) that first thou commest as a young scholler to Christian religion, & demaundest of a certaine wise Diuine, what it is that this new religion prescribeth? Hee will aunswere thee, that nothing else it requireth at thy handes, but that thou bee a good

man; and that thou mayst endeuor in this study with fruit, that the same religion giueth thee assistance: For commaunding that a carnall man should be made a spiritual, it giueth the holy Spirit, and by the benefite thereof he is made spirituall. Truly it is to bee lamented, that so manie yeeres thou hast borne the name of Christ, warfared vnder Christ, & yet art ignorant of the difference, which is betweene a Christian and a Iewe, betweene the law of the letter, and the lawe of grace. Thys difference heerein consisteth, (for since thou knowest it not, I will teach it thee) that the law of the letter, commandeth a man to be good, and yeeldeth not strength to performe that which is commaunded: but the law of grace, both commaundeth this, and giueth grace and helpe to thee to be good, and that thou mayst forsake thy sinnes.

               But if you shall aske mee, howe it may be a yoake and sweet, when as the nature of a yoake is to bee heauie? To this I aunswere, that the reason hereof is this, because our Lord lightneth the same, as he promiseth by his prophet; And I will be vnto them, as hee that lightneth theyr yoake vpon theyr shoulders.
                  Hosea, 12. What wonder is it therefore, if the yoake bee light, which our Lorde sustaineth, lifteth vp, and as it were he himselfe beareth?
            If the bush burned and was not consumed because our Lord was in it, what wonder is it that the burthen shoulde be light, if in the same the sayd Lord be, that helpeth vs to beare it? Will yee that I showe yee as well the one as the other, in one and the same person? Heare what the holy Apostle sayth;2. Cor. 4. Wee suffer tribulation in all things, yet

and sweetnes, which our Lorde yeeldeth to them. Truly the Prophet Esay insinuateth the same also, when hee saith; They that trust in the Lorde,
                  Esay, 40. shall change their fortitude, and shall assume winges as it were an Eagle, shall runne, and not be trauailed; shall walke, and not be weary. Doost thou see heere the yoke lightned by grace; seest thou the fortitude of the flesh, changed into the fortitude of the spirit? or that I may speake better, the fortitude of man, into the fortitude of God? Seest thou howe the holy Prophet concealeth not eyther the trouble, or the quiet? Thou hast not therefore my brother any cause, for which thou shouldst abhor this way▪ although it be wearisome and difficult, when so many & so mighty the meanes be that make it plaine and easie.
         
         
            
            
               The Argument.
               A man ought not to deferre his repentance and amendment of life from day to day, but presently turne vnto our Lord, and repent for all his sinnes, whereby hee hath offended the deuine Maiestie, and his neighbour.
            
            CHAP. 22.
            WEll therefore my brother, if on the one side there be so many and so effectuall reasons, which call vs to the amendment of our lyues; and on the other side we haue no iust excuse, that may induce vs from reformation of our wayes.

               t it is now time, nay rather, that the t me is past, in which for thy offences

thou wert to repent & turne to God. Remember thou art a Christian, regenerated by the water of Baptisme, that thou hast God for thy Father, the Church for thy Mother, the milk of the Gospell, a dainty that thou art nourished by, the Apostolicall & Euangelicall doctrine, & that which is more worthy, with the bread of Angels: that is, with the most sacred Sacrament of Christes bodie and blood, and by all these nothing at all bettered, but to haue liued no lesse dissolutely, then if thou hadst beene an Ethnique, without hauing any knowledge of God. For tell me what kinde of sinne is it which thou hast not committed? what forbidden tree is there, whose fruite thou hast not affected? what fielde which thy lust hath not ouer-past? what euer hath beene offered to thy sight, that thou hast not desired? what appetite hast thou euer resisted, vnder the remembrance of God and Christian profession? what els more couldst thou haue done if thou hadst not had faith? if thou expectedst no other life after this? If that strickt iudgement of God were not to be

feared? what is thy life but a continuall web of sin? a dunghill of vices? a way beset with thornes? and a rebellion against God? with whō hast thou hetherto liued, but with thine owne appetites, with the flesh, with ambition, with y• world? These were thy gods these thy Idols, which thou seruedst, & whō thou calledst vpon. Tell me, what respect hadst thou of Gods law & obedience towards him? euen no more didst thou feare him, then i
                  •
                he had bin a wooden God. For it is most certaine that there are many Christians, that with the same facility where-with they would sinne, if they beleeued God were not, doe also now sin notwithding they beleeue yt there is a God, they offend no lesse offending one, then they would do if they beleeued none: And what greater iniury may be done to ye diuine Maiesty? Finally, beleeuing all those things, which Christian Religion proposeth to be beleeued thou hast so liued, as any other wold haue liued, who thought all our faith to be but an olde wiues tale, and very ridiculous toyes.
            And if the multitude of thy sinnes

that are past, terrifie thee not, & the facility where-with thou cōmittedst them stir thee not, at least-wise what doth not his Maiesty and highnes moue thee, against whom thou hast sinned? Lift vp thine eyes & behold the immensity and greatnes of that Lord, whō the powers of heauen adore, before whose Maiesty lies prostrate, whatsoeuer the circuit of the world containeth: in whose presence whatsoeuer is created, is naught else but a light strawe: and see how vnwoorthy it is, that thou so abiect a worme as thou art, darest so often offend and prouoke the eyes of so great a Maiestie vnto anger.
            Consider the fearefull greatnes of his iustice, and the memorable punishments which frō the beginning hetherto hee hath exercised in the world, & with whom he hath persecuted sinnes, not onely in perticuler persons, but in whole Kingdomes, Citties, & Prouinces also, yea, in the whole world: neither in the world only, but in the heauens, not only in strangers & sinners, but also against his most innocent sonne, who would satisfie for all that which we ought.

Nowe if that be done in a greene wood, and for other mens sins, what shall be done in a dry, and for our owne sinns? What therefore more fondly & more imprudently may be done, then that a vile miserable man durst delude God, who hath so powerful hands, that if he extend them, and touch him with them, with a verie little touch hee can thrust him headlong into the depth of hell.
            Mark besides this the patience of this Lord, who so long time exspecteth thee as long as thou hast offended him, and if thou after so many ritches, & long suffering of patience, where-with hee hath hetherto exspected thee, perseuer in abusing his mercy, & prouoking his wrath. He will shake his sword,
                  Psal. 7. and bende his bow, in which he hath prepared the vessels of death, and he will shoote his arrowes against thee.

profound misteries he wrote in the Canticles, lying prostrate before Idolls, and reprooued by God. Let vs behold one of those seauen Deacons of the Primatiue Church, fulfilled with the light & power of the holy Ghost, made not only an Heretique, but an arch Heretique, and an Author and Father of heresies. We see daily many stars of the heauen fall to the earth, with a miserable ruine, to wallow in the durt, to eate the huskes of the Hoggs, who a little before sitting at Gods table, were nourished with the bread of Angells. And if the iust for some hidden pride, negligence, & ingratitude, were in that man nere cast out of Gods fauour, hauing many yeres faith

Is it not rightfull, that after so long a time, & so many iniuries done vnto GOD, thou at last feare the diuine iustice, which by howe much the more greater patience it tollerateth thy sinnes, by so much the more greeuous torments and greater iustice dooth he chastise sinners? Is it not woorthily to be feared, that so long a time thou hast continued in sinne, so long liued in the disfauour of God, to haue so mighty an aduersary, who of a gracious Father, is made a iudge and an enemy? Is it not to be feared least that the violence of euill custome be turned into another nature, and there-from arise a necessity of sinne, and somewhat more? Is it not to bee suspected, least thou fall by little and little into greater offences, and that thou be deliuered into a reprobate sence, into which when a man is falne, hee hath not then any reason of any thing, how great soeuer it be.
            
               Iacob the Patriarch sayde to his Father in lawe Laban: Fourteene yeeres haue I serued thee, & all thy possession was in my hands, I haue hetherto administred all thy domesticall affaires, it is requisite therfore that at last I prouide for mine owne house. And thou, if thou hast serued the worlde so many yeeres, were it not conuenient, that now at length thou shouldest beginne to prouide for thy soule, and somewhat more circumspectly then heeretofore, regard the happinesse of the life to com? There is not any thing more short and fraile then mans life. And if thou so carefully studiest for things necessary in this so fraile lyfe, why doost thou not also imploy some labour in those things, which shall perpetually endure.
         
         
            
            
               The Argument.
               It is necessary that a man cōsider him selfe, and remember that hee is a Christian, and firmely assent to all thinges which our fayth setteth downe, whereto eyther loue or feare ought to mooue him. What thing so euer is created, inuiteth vs to the loue & seruice of God. Let a man therefore seeke wisedome, and hee shall heare all the words of Christ, who was crucified for his saluation.

            If therefore such and so manie things inuite thee to vertue, howe commeth it to passe, that there are found so rare and few louers & followers of the same? If men be moued by profit, what greater profit then eternall life? If by feare of punishment▪ what torture more terrible then that of hell?

If feare of danger moue vs, what greater perrill then death, whose houre is so vncertaine, and reason so strict? If peace, libertie, tranquilitie of spirit, and sweetnesse of life be desired of the whole world, it is manifest that all these are more aboundantly found in the life which is led according to the prescript of vertue, then that which

and humane passion: for a man is created reasonable, not a brute beast, and without reason. But if all these seeme to haue but small moment to perswade vertue, shall it not suffice to see God descend from heauen vpon the earth, and made man? and whereas in sixe dayes hee had created the whole world, he consumed thirty yeeres, and lost his life in reforming and redeeming man. God dieth, that sinne may die, and we will that that liue in our harts, to depriue thee of life, for which the very sonne of God suffered death: and what shall I say more? There are many reasons in this one, for I say not that Christ is to be behelde hanging on the Crosse, but whether so euer we turne our eyes, wee shall finde that all thinges exclaime, and call vs to this goodnes: for there is not a creature in this world, if it be well considered, that doth not inuite vs to the loue & seruice of our Lord. So that as many creatures as there are in this world, so many Preachers are they, books, reasons, and voyces which excite and inuite vs to that office. How is it therefore possible

that so many voyces, so many promises, so many threatnings suffice not to worke the same in vs? vvhat could God doe more then he did, and promise more liberally then he promised? and threaten mo
                  •
               e seuerely then hee threatned, that hee might draw vs to him, and driue vs from sinnes? And is the arrogance of men as yet so great, or to speake more aptly, are men in such sort inchanted▪ that hauing faith they feare not, to rest all their life time in sins? to goe to bed in sinne? to rise and awake from sleepe in sinne? I, and that with such security, and without any scruple, as that neither for the same sleepe flieth from their eyes, neyther their appetite to eate perisheth, in no other sort then if all they beleeue were dreames, or that the Euangelists did write were lies?

thee not abstaine from any thing to which thy voluptuousnes draweth thee, neyther estewest thou the reuenge, neither doest thou that which he commaundeth, neither art thou ashamed to doe all that which thou desirest, if thou hast power to performe it. Tell me thou blind man, tell me thou foole, in such security what doth the worme of thy conscience? where is thy faith? where is thy braine? where thy iudgment, where thy reason: which as thou art a man, is onely remaining vnto thee.

farre more better had it beene that thou hadst neuer beene borne, then perpetually to be damned? Howe far better had it beene, if thou hadst not beene baptized, nor professour of the faith? for because thou hast abused them, thy damnation shall be the greater. For if the light of reason suffice to make the Philosophers inexcusable,
                  Rom. 1. because whē they knew God, they glorified him not, neither thanked him as God, as saith the Apostle: How lesse excusable are they, who hauing receaued the light of faith, and the water of baptisme, so often times come to his supper to receaue God himselfe, and daily heare his diuine doctrine, if they doe no more then those Philosophers? What other thing is to be concluded of all these which are hetherto said, then that there is not any either vnderstanding, wisedome, or counsaile in the world, then that forsaking the occupations and impediments of this life, we folow the only and certaine path, that leadeth vs to true peace, and eternall life. To this reason, equity, and the law inuite vs, to this heauen, earth, hell, life, death,

iustice, and Gods mercy: To this especially the holy ghost exhorteth vs by the mouth of Ecclesiasticus, saying:
                  Eccles. 6. My sonne receaue learning frō thy youth, and thou shalt find wisedom in thine olde age. Euen as he that ploweth, and hee that soweth come vnto her & sustaine or expect the fruits therof with patience: For in the work thereof thou shalt labor but a little, and quickly shalt thou eate of the generations thereof: Heare my sonne, & take the counsaile of vnderstanding, & despise not my precepts. Thrust thy feete into her fetters, and into her chaines thy neck: subiect thy shoulders & beare the same, & thou shalt not be wearie of her bonds. Search her out, and she wil appeare vnto thee, & being made continent leaue her not, for in the later times shalt thou find rest in the same, and it shall turne thee vnto ioy. And her fetters shal be vnto thee a protection of strength, and foundations of vertue, and the garments thereof a stoole of glory: for the ornament of life is in her, and her bonds a healthfull thraldome. Hetherto Ecclesiasticus: By which

words in some sort is vnderstoode, howe great the beauty, howe great the delights, how much the liberty, how many the ritches of true wisedom is, which is vertue it selfe, and the knowledge of God, of which we now speake. And if all these are not sufficient to conquer thy hurt, lift vp thine eyes on high, & doe not thou regard the waters of this world which perish and vanish away: But behold the Lord that hangeth on the Crosse, dying and satisfying for thy sinns: He hangeth there, in that forme yu seest exspecting thee with his feete fastned with rough nailes, his armes opened to receaue thee, his head bowed, that like to a prodigall sonne, he may giue thee the kisse of new peace. And from the Crosse hee calleth thee, if perhaps thou heare him, with so many voyces hee crieth vnto thee, as he hath wounds in his body.
            Imagine this most blessed Sauior speaking to thy hart, & saying; Returne, returne thou Sunamite;
                  Cant. 6. returne, returne, & I will receaue thee. I know thou hast committed fornication with many louers,
                  Iere. 3. yet returne

to me, and I will forgiue thee: Returne to mee because I am thy Father, thy God, thy Creator, thy Sauiour, thy true friend, thy only benefactor, thy absolute felicity, and thy last end. In me shalt thou finde rest, peace, saluation, truth, wisedom, and all goodnes: In me shalt thou find the fountaine of liuing water, which extingsheth all thirst, & maketh a man attaine euerlasting life. In me shalt thou be as a tree planted by the water side, that yeeldeth his fruite in due season, and his leafe shall not fall, all that thou doest shall prosper.
            Incline thine eare therefore my brother and heare: for if his prayers be execrable, that heareth not the cry of the poore, much lesse shal he be heard that is deaffe heere, and heareth not these prayers and lamentations.
            The end of the first part.
