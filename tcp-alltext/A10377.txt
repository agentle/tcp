M.DC.XVIII.
         
      
      
         
            
            
            
               ALthough KINGS
be not bound to giue
Account of their Actions
to any but GOD
alone; yet such are his
MAIESTIES proceedings,
as hee hath alwayes
beene willing to bring them before
Sunne and Moone, and carefull to satisfie
all his good people with his Intentions
and courses, giuing as well to future times
as to the present, true and vndisguised Declarations
of them; as iudging, that for
Actions not well founded, it is aduantage
to let them passe in vncertaine Reports;
but for Actions, that are built vpon sure
and solide grounds, (such as his Maiesties
are) it belongeth to them, to bee published
by open manifests: Especially his Maiestie
is willing, to declare and manifest to

the World, his proceedings in a case of
such a nature as this which followeth is;
since it not onely concernes his owne people,
but also a forreine Prince and State
abroad.
            Accordingly therefore, for that which
concerneth Sir Walter Raleigh late executed
for Treason (leauing the thoughts of
his heart, and the protestations that hee
made at his death to God that is the searcher
of all hearts, and Iudge of all Trueth)
his Maiestie hath thought fit to manifest
vnto the world, how things appeared vnto
himselfe, and vpon what Proofes and
euident Matter, and the Examination of
the Commaunders that were employed
with him, in the Voyage, (and namely of
those which Sir Walter Raleigh himselfe by
his owne Letter to Secretarie Winwood,
had commended for persons of speciall
worth and credit, and as most fit for greater
employments) his Maiesties proceedings
haue bin grounded, whereby it will
euidently appeare how agreeable they haue
beene in all points to Honour and Iustice.
            
               SIR Walter Raleigh hauing beene condemned
of high Treason, at his Maiesties
entrance into this Kingdome,
and by the space of fourteene yeeres, by his
Maiesties princely Clemency and Mercy,
not onely spared from his Execution, but
permitted to liue, as in Liberâ custodiâ in
the Tower, and to enioy his Lands and
Liuing, till all was by Law euicted from
him vpon another ground, and not by forfeiture;
(which notwithstanding, his Maiestie
out of his abundant Grace gaue him
a competent satisfaction for the same) at
length, hee fell vpon an Enterprise of a
golden Mine in Guiana.
            
            This proposition of his, was presented
and recommended to his Maiestie by Sir
Ralph Winwood, then Secretary of State, as
a matter not in the Aire, or speculatiue,
but reall, and of certaintie; for that Sir W.
Raleigh had seene of the Oare of the Mine
with his eyes, and tried the richnesse of it.
It is true, that his Maiestie, in his owne
princely iudgement, gaue no beleefe vnto
it; aswell, for that his Maiestie was verely

perswaded, that in Nature there are no
such Mines of gold entire, as they described
this to bee; and if any such had beene,
it was not probable that the Spaniards,
who were so industrious in the chase of
Treasure, would haue neglected it so long;
as also for that it proceeded from the person
of Sir Wal. Raleigh, inuested with such
circumstances both of his disposition and
fortune: But neuerthelesse Sir W. Raleigh
had so inchanted the world, with his confident
asseueration of that which euery
man was willing to beleeue, as his Maiesties
honour was in a manner ingaged, not
to deny vnto his people the aduenture and
hope of so great Riches, to bee sought and
atchieued, at the charge of Voluntaries;
especially, for that it stood with his Maiesties
Politique and Magnanimous courses,
in these his flourishing times of peace, to
nourish and incourage Noble and Generous
enterprises, for Plantations, Discoueries,
and opening of new Trades.
            Heereupon the late Spanish Ambassadour,
the Count de Gondomar, tooke

great alarme, and represented vnto his
Maiestie by loud and vehement assertions,
vpon iterated audiences, that he knew and
had discouered the intention and enterprise
of Sir W. Raleigh to bee but Hostile
and Piraticall, and tending to the breach
of the Peace betweene the two Crownes,
and danger and destruction of the King
his Masters Subiects in those parts; protesting
in a sort against the same. To which
his Maiesties answere alwayes was, that he
would send Sir Walter Raleigh with a limited
Commission, and that hee durst not vpon
perill of his head attempt any such matter;
and if hee did, hee would surely doe
iustice vpon him, or send him bound hand
and foot into Spaine, and all the gold and
goods he should obtaine by Robbery, and
bring home, were they neuer so great. And
for further caution, his Maiesty enioyned
Secretary Winwood, to vrge Sir Walter Raleigh
vpon his conscience, and alleageance
to his Maiestie, to deale plainely, and expresse
himselfe, whether hee had any other
intention, but onely to goe to those

golden Mines in Guiana, which hee not
onely solemnely protested vnto the saide
Sir Ralph Winwood, but by him writt a
close letter to his Maiestie, conteining a
solemne profession thereof, confirmed
with many vehement asseuerations, and
that hee neuer meant or would commit
any outrages or spoiles vpon the King of
Spaines Subiects. But notwithstanding,
his Maiestie acquainted the Spanish Ambassadour
with this his protestation; yet
the said Ambassadour would neuer recede
from his former iealousie, and importuning
his Maiestie to stay his voyage, alleadging
that the great number of shippes
that Sir Walter Raleigh had prepared for
that voyage, shewed manifestly, that hee
had no such peaceable intent; and offering
(vpon Sir Walter Raleigh his answere
thereunto, that those ships were onely
prouided for his safe conuoy) that if Sir
Walter Raleigh would goe with one or two
ships onely to seeke the said Mine, that
hee would mooue the King of Spaine to
send two or three ships with him backe

againe for his safe conuoy hither with all
his gold; And the said Ambassadours person
to remaine here in pledge for the King
his Master his performance thereof. But
such were the constant faire Offers of the
said Sir Walter Raleigh, and specious promises,
as his Maiestie in the end reiected
the importunate Suit of the said Spanish
Ambassadour for his stay, and resolued
to let him goe: but therewithall tooke
order, both that hee, and all those that
went in his company, should finde good
securitie, to behaue themselues peaceably
towards all his Maiesties Friends and Allies;
and to obserue strictly all the Articles
of the Commission, which his Maiestie
for that cause, had the greater care to haue
it well and clearely penned, and set downe.
And that his Maiesties honest intention
may heerein the better appeare, the words
of the Commission are heerein inserted,
as followeth.
            
               
               
               
                  
                     
                        
                           
                              IAMES, by the grace
of GOD, &c. To all
to whom these presents
shall come, to bee read,
heard, or seene, and to euery of them
greeting. Whereas Sir W. Raleigh
Knight, intendeth to vndertake a
voyage by Sea and shipping, vnto the
South parts of America, or elswhere
within America, possessed and inhabited
by heathen and sauage people, to
th'end to discouer and finde out some
commodities and merchandizes in
those Countries, that be necessary and
profitable for the Subiects of these
Our Kingdomes and Dominions,
whereof the Inhabitants there make
little or no vse or estimation; wherevpon

also may ensue by trade & commerce,
some propagation of the Christian
Faith, and reformed Religion amongst
those sauage and Idolatrous
people: And whereas We are crediblie
informed that there are diuers
Merchants and Owners of Ships,
and others, well disposed to assist the
sayde Sir VValter Raleigh in this
his enterprise, had they sufficient assurance
to enioy their due parts of the
profits returned (in respect of the perill
of Law wherein the saide Sir
VValter Raliegh now standeth:)
And wheras also We are informed,
that diuers other Gentlemen, the
kinsmen and friendes of the sayde Sir
VValter Raleigh, and diuers Captaines
and other Commanders are
also desirous to follow him, and to aduenture

their liues with him, in this
his Iourney, so as they might be commanded
by no other then himselfe.
                        Know yee, that We, vpon deliberate
consideration had of the premisses,
being desirous by all wayes and
meanes to worke and procure the benefit
and good of Our louing Subiects,
and to giue Our Princely furtherance
to the sayde Sir VValter Raleigh,
his friendes and associates heerein, to
the incouragement of others in the like
laudable Iourneys and enterprizes, to
bee heereafter prosecuted and pursued;
and especially in aduancement
and furtherance, aswell of the conuersion
of sauage people, as of the increase
of the Trade, Traffique, and
Merchandizes vsed by Our Subiects
of this Our Kingdome, being most

famous throughout all Nations: Of

America (possessed and inhabited,

liue vnder Our obeysance and alleageance
as shall willingly accompany

him, with sufficient Shipping, Armour,
Weapons, Ordinance, Munition,
Powder, Shot, Habiliments,
Victuals, and such Wares and
Merchandizes, as are esteemed by
the wilde people in those parts, clothing,

in those parts to giue away, sell, barter,
exchange, or otherwise dispose of
the same goods, merchandizes and
premisses to the most benefit, and at
the will and pleasure of the saide Sir
Walter Raleigh and his company,
and such other person or persons, as

shalbe aduenturers or assistāts with, or

& from thence to return, import, conuey,
& bring into this our kingdom, or
any other Our Dominions, such gold,
siluer, bullion, or any other wares, or
merchandizes, or commodities whatsoeuer,
as they shall thinke most fit and
conuenient; and the same being so returned,
imported, conueyed, and
brought into this our Kingdome, or any
other our Dominions, to haue, take,
keepe, retaine, and conuert to the only
proper vse, benefit, and behoofe of
the sayd Sir W. Raleigh and his
sayd Company, and other persons aduenturers
and assistants with or to
him in this voyage, without the let, interruption,
molestation, and disturbance
of Vs, Our Heires or Successours,

or any the Officers or Ministers
of Vs, Our Heires or Successours
whatsoeuer, Paying and answering
vnto Vs, Our Heires, and Successours
the full fift part in fiue parts
to be diuided, of all such gold, and
siluer, and bullion, and oare of gold or
siluer, and pearle, and precious stone,
as shalbe so imported ouer and besides,
and together with such Customes,
Subsidies and other duties, as shall
bee due for or in respect of any other
Goods, Wares, or Merchandizes
whatsoeuer to be imported by the true
meaning of these presents. And to
the end the sayd Sir W. Raleigh
may be the more encouraged to go forward
in this his enterprise, and all
our louing Subiects desirous to bee aduenturers
with him or assistant vnto

him, may bee the more incited to further
his proceedings: We doe heereby
in verbo Regio, for Vs, Our Heires
and Successours, couenant, promise,
and grant, to and with the sayd Sir
W. Raleigh and all other persons
that shall accompany him or to bee attendant
vpon him, or to bee aduenturers
or assistants with or to him in
this his voyage, that no gold, siluer,
goods, wares, or merchandizes whatsoeuer
of what kinde or sort soeuer, by
him or them or any of them to bee imported
into this Our Kingdome of
England, or any other our Dominions
from any the sayd South or other
parts of America, (possessed or inhabited
as aforesayd) shalbe attached,
seized or taken by Vs, Our Heires or
Successours, or to the vse of Vs, Our

Heires or Successours, or by any the
Officers or Ministers of Vs, Our
Heires or Successours whatsoeuer;
But that the same and euery of them
(the fift part of the sayd gold, siluer or
bullion, and oare of gold and siluer
and pearle and precious stone, and other
the Customes and duties aforesayd
being truly answered and payd)
shall bee, and remaine to the sole and
proper vse and behoofe of the sayd
Sir W. Raleigh and his sayd company,
and such persons as shall be aduenturers
with him, or assistant to him
in this his voyage, Any Law, Statute,
Act of Parliament, Proclamation,
Prouision, or restraint, or any right,
title or clayme of Vs, Our Heires or
Successours, or any other matter or
thing whatsoeuer to the contrarie

in any wise notwithstanding. And
further, of Our more especiall grace,
certaine knowledge, and meere
motion, Wee doe hereby for Vs, Our
Heires, and Successors, ordaine, constitute
and appoint the sayd Sir W.
Raleigh to be the sole Gouernor and
commaunder of all persons that shall
trauell, or be with him in the sayd voiage,
to the sayd South, or other parts
of America (so possessed and inhabited
as aforesayd) or in returning from
thence. And We doe hereby giue vnto
him, full power and authority to
correct, punish, pardon, gouerne and
rule them or any of them, according to
such orders, ordinances, constitutions,
directions, and instructions, as by
the sayd Sir W. Raleigh shall bee
from time to time established, aswell

in cases capital and criminall, as ciuil,
both Marine and other; So alwayes
as the sayd statutes, ordinances and
proceedings (as neere as conueniently
may be) bee agreeable to the Lawes,
Statutes, Gouernment and Policy of
this our Realme of England, and not
against the true Christian faith now
professed in the Church of England.
And because that in
such and the like enterprises
and voyages, great inconueniences
haue growne by the mutinous and disorderly
carriage of the Marriners
and Saylors imployed in the same,
for want of sufficient authoritie to
punish them according to their offences:
We doe therefore by these presents
for Vs, our Heires and Successors,
giue full power and authority to

the said Sir Walter Raleigh, in
case of rebellion, or mutiny by sea or
land, to vse and exercise Marshall
law (vpon iust ground and apparent
necessity) in as large and ample
manner as Our Lieutenant Generall
by sea or land, or Our Lieutenants
in Our Counties, within Our Realm
of England, haue, had, or ought to
haue by force of their Commission of
Lieutenancie. And Wee doe further
by these presents, giue full power
and authoritie to the said Sir Walter
Raleigh, to collect, nominate and
appoint such Captaines and other inferior
Commanders and Ministers
vnder him, as shalbe requisite
for the better ordering and gouerning
of his companie, and the good of
the voyage. And further, We doe

by these presents, for Vs, Our
Heires and Successors, straightly
charge and Command the Warden
of Our Cinque-ports, and all the Customers,
Comptrollers, Surueyers,
Serchers, Waiters and other Officers
and Ministers of Vs, Our Heires
and Successors for the time being, that
they, and euerie of them doe quietly
permit and suffer the said Sir
Walter Raleigh, and all person
and persons that shalbe willing to trauell
and aduenture with him in this
voyage with their Ships, Munition,
Goods, Wares and Merchandizes
whatsoeuer out of this Our Realme,
or any other Our Dominions, to passe
into the said South or other parts of
America, (possessed and inhabited
as aforesaid) and from thence to returne

and import into this Our
Realme, or any other our Dominions,
any Goods, Wares or Merchandizes
whatsoeuer, and there to
sell or otherwise to dispose of the same,
to the best benefit and aduantage, and
to the onely vse and behoofe of the
said Sir Walter Raleigh and his
companie, and such other persons as
shalbe aduenturers with him in this
voyage, paying the fift part of all
gold and siluer, bullion, and oare of
gold and siluer, and of pearle and pretious
stone imported, and other the
Customes and Duties aforesaid. And
these Presents, or the inrollement
thereof shalbe vnto the said Warden
of the Cinque-ports, Customers,
Comptrollers and other the officers &
ministers aforesaid, for the time being

a sufficient Warrant and discharge
in that behalfe. And our
Will and pleasure is; And by these
presents, for Vs, our Heires and
Successors, Wee doe grant vnto the
said Sir VValter Raleigh, That
these our Letters Patents, or the
Inrollement therof, and all and singular
grants, clauses and things therein
contained, shalbe firme, strong, sufficient
and effectuall in Law, according
to our gratious pleasure and
meaning herein expressed; Any
Law, Statute, Act, Prouision, Ordinance
or restraint, or anie other matter
or thing to the contrarie thereof
in any wise notwithstanding. Although
expresse mention &c. In
Witnesse whereof &c. Witnesse

and twentieth day of August, in the
fourteenth yeare of our Reigne of
England, France and Ireland,
and of Scotland the
fiftieth.
                        Per breue de priuato
Sigillo.
                     
                  
               
            
            
               THis Commission so drawne and framed
(as as you see) his Maiestie himselfe
did oft peruse and reuise, as foreseeing the
future euents; the tenor whereof appeareth
to be so farre from giuing Sir Walter
Raleigh warrant, or colour to inuade any
of the Territories, occupate and possest
by the Spaniards, as it tended to a direction,
rather of commerce, then spoile, euen
towards the Sauages themselues. And the
better to containe Sir Walter Raleigh, and
to hold him vpon his good behauiour, his
Maiestie denied (though much sued vnto
for the same) to grant him pardon for his
former treasons, both to disauthorise him
with those, that were vnder his Cōmand,
(in case he should attempt to exceede his
Commission) and to reserue him to the Iustice
of the Law, if by new offences hee
should make himselfe indigne of former
mercies. And as for the good securitie
which his Maiestie ordered to be taken,
for their good and peaceable behauiour in
the voyage; his Maiestie neuer heard any
thing to the contrary but that it was performed

till they were vpon their parting;
and then was it told him, that euery one
of the principals that were in the voyage,
had put in security one for another, which
if his Maiestie had knowen in time, hee
would neuer haue accepted of.
            But howsoeuer the Commission was
penned; and whatsoeuer the cautions
were which his Maiestie intended or vsed,
and whatsoeuer the protestations and
promises were, that Sir Walter Raleigh
made or exhibited, it appeareth plainely,
by the whole sequell of his Actions, that
he went his owne way, and had his owne
ends: First, to procure his libertie, and
then to make new fortunes for himselfe,
casting abroad onely this tale of the Mine
as a lure to get aduenturers and followers;
hauing in his eye the Mexico Fleete, the
sacking and spoyle of Townes planted
with Spaniards, the depredation of Ships,
and such other purchase; and making account,
that if he returned rich, hee would
ransome his offences (little looking into
the nature and Character of his Maiesties

Iustice and gouernment) and if otherwise,
he would seeke his fortune by flight, and
new enterprises in some forraine Countrey.
            In execution therefore of these his designes,
Sir Walter Raleigh carrying the reputation
of an actiue, wittie, and valiant
Gentleman, and especially of a great Commander
at Sea, by the inticement of this
golden baite of the Mine, and the estimation
of his owne name, drew vnto him
many braue Captaines, and other Knights
and Gentlemen of great blood and worth,
to hazzard and aduenture their liues, and
the whole, or a great part of their estates
and fortunes in this his Voyage: whose
ruines and decayes following, remaine as
sad and grieuous reliques and monuments
of his vnfortunate iourney, and vnfaithfull
proceedings.
            But before hee went from London, hee
was not so reserued, nor so constant vnto
his pretence of the Mine, but that some
sparkes brake foorth of that light, which
afterwards appeared. For hee cast foorth

some words to some particular friends of
his Company, That hee knew a Towne in
those parts, vpon which hee could make
a sauing Voyage in Tobacco, though there
were no other spoile. Neuerthelesse, to
make the better faith of that he had giuen
out touching the Mine, he promised his
Companie at London, that when he came
to Plimouth, hee would take a great company
of Pioners out of the West, (where
best workemen are of that kind) and hee
maintained this his pretence so farre, as
hee billited the sayd Pioners for seuerall
ships; but when he came into the West this
vanished. For it is testified of all parts, and
by himselfe confessed, that he carried none
at all, excusing it, that there were many other
tall men of the Mariners, and common
Souldiers, that he would haue made
fall to worke; which is a slender excuse of
omitting so principall a point. As for
Pickeaxes, Mattockes and Shouels for the
working of the Mine, it is true he carried
some small quantitie for a shew, but by the
iudgement of all that were in his companie,

nothing neere sufficient for that which
had been requisite for the working of the
Mine, which be excused onely by saying,
that his men neuer saw them vnpacked,
and that the Mine was not past a foote and
a halfe vnder ground.
            After, when hee was once at Sea, hee
did not much labor to nourish and maintaine
the beliefe, that be meant to make his
voyage vpon the profite of the Mine, but
fell a degree, as if it were sufficient to
bring home certainty and visible proofe,
that such a Mine there was, though hee
brought not the riches of it. For soone
after his setting foorth from Ireland, hee
professed, that if hee brought home but a
handfull or basketfull of Oare, to show the
King, hee cared for no more, for it was
enough to saue his credit; and being charged
therewith, hee confessed the speech,
with this argument and inference, that if
there had beene a handfull of the Mine, it
followed there was a Mine to be confessed;
as if so many Ships, so many liues of men,
such charge of prouisions, and such an honourable

Commission, had beene but for
an experiment.
            About the same time likewise, he began
to forget his Commission, aswell as his
pretences of the Mine; for hee did declare
himselfe to diuers of his company, that hee
meant to take St. Thomé, and that he would
make his voyage good vpon that Towne,
for that it was very rich; So as where it was
blowne abroad, that the assault of Saint
Thomé was inforced by a kinde of necessity,
for that our Troupes were first assailed,
it appeareth manifestly, both by his speech
at London, of a Towne indefinitely, and by
this his speech earely in his voyage at Sea
of St. Thomé by name, that it was an originall
designe of his from the beginning:
And yet it is confessed by all, that the parts
of Guiana, where St. Thomé was scituate,
were planted by Spaniards, who had diuers
Townes in the same tract, with some
Indians intermixed, that are their Vassals,
so as it is plaine, both place and persons
were out of his Commission.
            And that this was well knowne to him

it appeares notably in a letter of his owne
hand, written since his returne from his
voyage, wherein hee complaines, that the
Spaniards of the same place did murder
diuers of his men, which came in peace to
trade with them, some seuen yeeres past;
neither doeth he in that letter, any way decline
his knowledge, that those parts Were
inhabited by the Spaniards, but stands vpon
a former title, which hee would needs
now haue strengthened by a new possession;
notwithstanding that this his pretence
is no way competible with his Commission,
and that himselfe before his going
neuer made ouerture, or allegation of any
such pretext, nor so much as intimated, or
insinuated any such designe or purpose.
            Againe, before hee came to the
Islands, hee made no difficultie to tell many
in expresse termes, that hee meant to
surprise and set vpon the Mexico Fleete,
though sometimes hee would quallifie it,
by saying, If all failed, or if the Action of
the Mine were defeated.
            
            And Sir Walter Raleigh himselfe being

charged with these speaches, confessed
the words, but saith, that in time, they
were spoken after the Action of the Mine
was defeated; and that it was propounded
by him, to the end, to keepe his men
together, and if he spake it before, it was
but discourse at large.
            After, when hee began to be vpon the
approaches of his pretended designe of
the Mine, and was come to Trinidad,
hee fell sicke in some extremitie, and in
doubt of life (as was thought) at what
time hee was mooued by some principall
persons about him, vpon two points, in
case hee should decease: The one, that
hee would nominate a Generall to succeed
him; The other, that hee would
giue some direction for prosecution of the
Action of the Mine. To the first hee
made answere, that his Commission could
nor bee set ouer, and therefore left them
to agree of that among themselues: but
for the Mine, hee profest hee could giue
them no direction; and stayed not there,
but told them, there was another course

(which hee did particularize vnto them to
bee a French Commission, whereby they
might doe themselues most good vpon
the Spaniards.
            When hee was vpon recouerie, he dispatched
the Land-forces pretended for
the Mine, and had designed Captaine
Sentleger to command in that Expedition:
but by reason of Sentlegers infirmitie at
that time, he resorted to his kinseman
Captaine George Raleigh, who was his
Sergeant Maior; in whose written Commission
which he gaue him, he was wary
enough not to expresse the taking of St.
Thomé, but onely inserted a clause of Commandement;
That they should in all things obey
him, as they would doe to himselfe in person:
yet in priuate directions and instructions,
hee did open himselfe to diuers of
his Company, that in case they should
not receiue some aduertisment, that the
Towne was reinforced by new supplies of
men (whereby the enterprise might bee of
too great hazard for their number) they
should take the Towne first, telling them,

that the Mine was but three miles distant
short of the Towne, and inferring (as
Kemish expounded it afterwards) that it
was in vaine to meddle with the Mine, except
the Towne were first taken, and the
Spaniards chased; for that otherwise, they
should but discouer it, and worke it for
the Spaniards: and when hee had opened
himselfe thus farre, some of his company,
of the more intelligent and duetifull sort,
did in plain terms turn it vpon him, setting
before him, that the taking of the Towne,
would breake the Peace, and that they
should goe against the Commmission:
Whereupon, most falsly and scandalously,
hee doubted not with confidence to affirme,
that he had order by word of mouth
from the King and his Councell, to take
the Towne, if it were any hinderance to
the digging of the Mine.
            But the euent did sufficiently expound
and manifest the direction; and yet that
kinde of interpretation little needed, for
that yong M. Raleigh, (who was likest to
know his fathers secret) when he ledde his

souldiers vpon the Towne, vsed these or
the like words, Come on my hearts, here is the
Mine that ye must expect, they that looke for any
other Mine, are fooles; And with this did
well concurre that which followed, in the
prosecution of the Mine after the Towne
was taken; For this Mine was not onely
imaginary, but moueable, for that which
was directed to bee 3. miles short of Saint
Thomé, was after sought 30. miles beyond
S. Thomé.
            
            All this while Sir W. Raleigh staied at
Pont degallo, by the space of some 9. weekes,
during which time it was much noted by
those that remained with him, that the
speech of the Mine was dead, (wheras men
in expectation do commonly feede themselues
with the talke of that they long to
heare of;) Nay more, after he had receiued
newes of the taking of the Towne, which
had beene the fittest time to pursue the enterprize
of the Mine, (in regard the Towne
that might haue beene the impediment
was mastered) hee neuer entertained any
such designe, but contrariwise, hauing

knowledge at the same time, that his son
was slaine, (who as it seemes was his onely
care amongst the Land souldiers) he did
mooue very inhumanly, to remooue not a
little from Pont degallo to Port-hercule in respect
of the danger of the Current (as hee
pretended) but to goe for the Charibes many
leagues off; accompting (as it seemeth)
the land Souldiers, but as fruges consumere
natos, and hauing his thoughts onely vpon
Sea forces, which how they should haue
beene imployed, euery man may iudge.
And whereas some pretence is made by
him, as if hee should leaue some word at
Pont degallo of direction, to what place the
land Souldiers should follow him; it is
plaine, he knew them at that time so distressed
for victuall, as famine must haue
ouertaken them, before they could ouertake
him; at which time one of his Captaines
told him, that he had deliuered out
52. men to that seruice, which were then
at the enterprize on Land, whose liues hee
held at a deare rate, and that he would not
weigh Anchor, as long as he had a Cable

to ride by, or a Cake of bread to eate: So
Sir W. Raleigh finding no consent in that
which hee propounded, that cruell purpose
was diuerted.
            It was also much obserued, that after
that vnfortunate returne of Kemish, notwithstanding
Sir W. Raleigh did publiquely
giue out, that hee would question him
for failing to prosecute the Mine, hee had
him at Dinner, and Supper, and vsed him
as familiarly and as kindly as before. And
to Geo. Raleigh the Sergeant Major, to
whom he did vse the like discountenances
in publique, who tooke it more tenderly,
and complained, and brake with him about
it; he did open himselfe more plainely,
telling him that hee must seeme to doe
as much as he did, to giue satisfaction.
            After all this, when the prosecution of
this imaginarie Mine vanished, and was
defeated, and that his Company cast a sad
eye homewards, finding they were but
abused, Sir Walter Raleigh called a Councell
of his Captaines, and helde the same
in his Cabbine, where hee propounded to

them, that his Intention and designe
was; First, to make to the New-found
lands, and there to revictuall and refresh
his Ships; And thence to goe to the Westerne
Islands, and there to lie in waite to
meete with the Mexico Fleete, or to surprise
some Carrackes; and so hauing gotten
treasure, which might make him welcome
into any forreine Countrey, to take
some newe course for his future fortunes,
valuing himselfe as a man of
great enterprise, and fame abroad; but
then and at diuers times, hee did directly,
and openly declare, that it was no comming
for ENGLAND, for that he knew
not how things would be construed, and
that he (for his part) would neuer put his
head vnder the Kings girdle, except hee
first saw the great Seale for his pardon.
            At which time, his cogitations imbracing
East and West, rather then any returne
into his Countrey, hee did in particular
make promise to a principall Commander
in his Company, to giue him a
Ship to goe into the East Indies, if hee

would accompanie him thither. But according
to his first proiect, hee went to
the New found Land, which hee needed
not to haue done, if his purpose had been
for England, (for that hee had victuals enough,
and to spare, for that iourney) and
there at New found Land his other company
hauing formerly dispersed and forsaken
him, his owne companie which was
in his owne Ship began likewise to mutine.
And although some old Pirates, either
by his inciting, or out of feare of
their owne case, were fierce and violent
for the Sea, and against the returne, yet
the far greater number were for the return;
at which time himselfe got aland, and
stood vpon the Sea banke, ànd put it to a
question, whether they should returne for
England, or land at New found Land:
Whereupon there was a diuision of voyces,
the one part to the Starreboard, and
the other to the Larboard; of which that
part which was for the returne for England,
was two parts of three, and would by
no meanes be drawen to set foote on land,

but kept themselues in the Ship, where
they were sure they were masters; which
hee perceiuing, for feare of further mutinie,
professed in dissimulation, that hee
himselfe was for the returne into England,
and came and stood amongst them that
had most voyces; But neuerthelesse, after
that he despaired to draw his companie to
follow him further, hee made offer of his
owne Ship (which was of great value) to
his company, if they would set him aboard
a French Barque: The like offer he
made, when hee came vpon the Coast of
Ireland, to some of his chiefe Officers
there.
            But about the time of his arriuall vpon
the coast of Ireland, the forcing and sacking
of Saint Thomé, and the firing of
the Towne, and the putting the Spaniards
to the sword, was noysed abroad in all
parts, and was by speciall aduertisement
comne vnto the knowledge of the
Count de Gondomar, then Ambassador for
the King of Spaine with his Maiesty, who
therevpon prayed audience of his Maiesty,

and with great instance demanded Iustice
against the persons, and their goods
(who had committed those outrages and
made those spoyles vpon his Maiesties
subiects) according to his Maiesties promise,
and the treaty of Peace. Whereupon
his Maiestie published his Royall Proclamation
for the discouery of the truth
of Raleighs proceedings, and the aduancement
of Iustice. Notwithstanding all
which, his Maiestie vsed a gracious and
milde course towards Sir Walter Raleigh,
sending downe Sir L. Stucley Vice-admirall
of the Countie of Deuon, to bring
Sir Walter Raleigh in faire manner, and as
his health would giue leaue, by easie iourneyes
to London. For about this time
Sir Walter Raleigh was comne from Ireland
into England, into the Port of Plimouth,
where it was easie to discerne with what
good will hee came thither, by his immediate
attempt to escape from thence; For
soone after his comming to Plimouth, before
hee was vnder guard, he dealt with
the Owner of a French Barque (pretending

it was for a Gentleman a friend of his)
to make ready his Barque for a passage,
and offered him twelue Crownes for his
paines: And one night he went in a little
Boate to haue seene the Barque that should
haue transported him, but the night being
verie darke, hee missed of the Barque,
and came backe againe, nothing done;
wherein by the way appeares, that it was
not any traine laide for him by Sir Lewis
Stucley or any other (as was voyced) to
mooue or tempt him to an escape, but
that hee had a purpose to flie, and escape
from his first arriuall into England.
            
            But in this his purpose, he grew to be more
resolute, and fixed, after that the Lords of
his Maiesties Councell, obseruing the delaies
in his comming vppe, had sent vnto
Stucley, some quicke letters for the hastening
thereof: But thereupon, as his desire
of escape encreased, so did the difficulty
thereof increase also; for that Stucley from
that time foorth kept a better guard vpon
him, whereof he tooke that apprehension,
in so much as (knowing Stucley to bee

witty and watchfull) hee grew to an opinion
that it would bee impossible for him
to escape, except hee could winne one of
these two points; either to corrupt Stucley,
or at lest to get to haue some liberty,
when he came to London, of remayning
in his owne house; for guiltinesse did tell
him that vpon his comming to London, it
was like hee should bee laid prisoner in the
Tower. Wherefore he saw no other way,
but in his iourney to London, to counterfeit
sickenesse in such a manner, as might
in commiseration of his extremity, moue
his Maiesty to permit him to remaine in
his owne house, where he assured himselfe
ere long, to plot an opportunity of an escape:
And hauing in his company one
Mannowry a French man, a professor of
Physicke, and one that had many Chymicall
receipts, hee practised by Crownes, and
promised to draw him into his consort, the
better to make faith of his counterfeiting
to be sicke: the story whereof, Mannowry
himselfe reporteth to haue passed in this
manner.
            
               
               
               
                  
                     
                        VPon Saturday the 25. of Iuly, Sir Walter
Raleigh, Sir Lewis Stucley, and Mannoury
went to lie at Master Drakes, where
the Letters of Commission from the Priuie
Councell were brought vnto Sir Lewis Stucley,
by one of his Maiesties messengers, which caused
a sudden departure, with much more haste
then was expected before: and the countenance
of Sir Walter Raleigh was much changed
after Sir Lewis Stucley had shewed the Commission;
for Mannowry sawe him from the stairehead
(hee beeing alone in his chamber, the
doore standing halfe open) how hee stamped
with his feete, and pulled himselfe by the haire,
swearing in these words, Gods wounds, is it
possible my fortune should returne vpon me thus
againe?
                        
                        From Master Drakes they went on their iourney
to the house of Master Horsey, distant from
thence foure miles, or thereabouts. It was in
that houre that Sir Walter Raleigh began first to
cause Mannowry to bee sounded, what was in
his heart, by an olde domesticke of his called
Captaine King, who there began to discourse

vnto Mannowry of the infortunitie of his Master,
and amongst other things, sayd thus; I
would wee were all at Paris, To whome Mannowry
answered, I would wee were all at London,
alas, what should wee doe at Paris? Because, quoth
King, that as soone as wee come to London, they
will commit Sir Walter Raleigh to the Tower, and
cut off his head: Whereupon Mannowry answered,
That hee hoped better then so, and that
hee was sorrie for his ill fortune; and that according
to his small abilitie, hee was ready to doe
him all honest seruice hee could, so it might bee
done without offence.
                        After dinner, it being Sunday, Sir Walter Raleigh
departed from Master Horsey his house,
and went to Sherburne, and in the way when
hee came within view thereof, turning to Mannowrie,
and shewing him the place and the
territorie about it, hee sayd vnto him sighing,
That all that was his, and that the King had vniustly
taken it from him. Hee and Stucley lay not
at Sherburne, but were inuited to the house of
olde Master Parham: Mannowry and their traine
went to lie at Sherburne, at the signe of the
George. The next day, being Munday, the seuen
and twentieth of Iuly, Mannowry went to
them, and from thence they tooke their way towards
Salisbury, fiue and thirty miles from Sherburne;
and arriuing there, Sir Walter Raleigh going
afoote downe the hill, addressed himselfe

vnto Mannowry, and asked him if hee had any of
his Vomits, or other Medicines; which hee telling
him that he had, he prayed him to make one
ready against the next morning, and to tell no
body therof. I know (quoth he) that it is good for me
to euacuate many bad humours, & by this means I shall
gaine time to worke my friends, giue order for my affaires,
and, it may bee, pacifie his Maiesty before my
comming to London; for I know well, that assoone
as I come there, I shall to the Tower, and that they will
cut off my head, if I vse no meanes to escape it; which
I cannot doe, without counterfeiting to be sicke, which
your vomits will effect, without suspicion. For which
cause the same euening, as soone as he arriued, he
laide him downe vpon a bedde, complayning
much of his head, and blaming his great dayes
iourney from Sherborne to Salisbury, (notwithstanding
he supped very well) but after supper
hee seemed to bee surprised with a dimnesse of
sight, by a swimming or giddinesse in his head,
and holding his hand before his face, hee rose
from his bed, and being ledde by the arme by Sir
Lewis Stucley, hee staggered so, that hee strooke
his head with some violence against a post of the
gallery before his Chamber, which made Sir
Lewis Stucley thinke that hee was sicke indeed;
in which beleefe Mannowry left him for that
time.
                        The next day in the morning, he sent his Lady
his wife, and most of his seruants to London,
                           
and also Captaine King: and Cuthbert and Mannowry,
and Sir Lewis Stucley being in Stucleyes
chamber, a seruant of the saide Sir Walter named
Robine, came and told them that his Master was
out of his wittes, and that hee was naked in his
shirt vpon all foure, scratching and biting the rushes
vpon the Plankes, which greatly pitied Sir
Lewis Stucley, who rising in haste, sent Mannowry
to him, who when hee came, found him gotten
againe to his bed, and asking him what he ailed,
he answered, he ailed nothing, but that hee
did it of purpose. And Sir Walter Raleigh asking
him for his vomit, hee gaue it him, who made
no bones, but swallowed it downe incontinentlie:
At which time Sir L. Stucley comming in,
Sir Walter began againe to crie and raue; Then
Mannowry went out of the Chamber, and the
vomit which hee had giuen him was an houre
and a halfe before it wrought, but in the meane
time Sir Walter Raleigh beganne to drawe vp his
legges and armes all on a heape, as it had beene
in a fit of Conuulsions, and contractions of his
Sinewes; and that with such vehemencie, that
Sir Lewis Stucley had much adoe with the helpe
of others to pull out streight, sometimes an arme,
sometimes a legge; which against all the strength
they had, he would draw vp againe as it was before;
whereat the sayd Sir Lewis Stucley, tooke
great compassion, causing him to be well rubbed
and chafed; which Sir Walter Raleigh himselfe

afterwards told vnto Mannowry, laughing that
he had well exercised Sir Lewis Stucley, & taught
him to be a Physitian.
                        This fained fitte being thus past, Sir Walter
Raleigh called Mannowry, and when he came, hee
prayed him to stay by him, and said hee would
take some rest. Mannowrie shut the doore, and
being alone with him, Sir Walter Raleigh tolde
him, That his vomite had done nothing as yet,
and said, that hee would take another more violent;
but Mannowry assuring him, that without
doubt it would worke, hee contented himselfe,
and asked Mannowry if hee could inuent any
thing, that might make him looke horrible and
loathsome outwardly, without offending his
principall parts, or making him sicke inwardly:
Mannowry studied a little, and then tolde him,
that hee would make a Composition presently,
of certaine things which would make him like
a Leper from head to foote, without doing him
any harme, which at his intreatie hee effected
speedily; at which time Sir Walter Raleigh
gaue him the reason, why hee did it, telling him
that his beeing in that case, would make the
Lords of the Counsell affraide to come neere
him, and mooue them with more pitie to fauour
him. Soone after that Mannowry had put
this Composition vpon his Brow, his Armes,
and his Breast, Sir Lewis Stucley came into the
Chamber, and Mannowry went away, and Sir
Lewis Stucley perceiuing the places where Mannowry
                           
had put this Composition to be all pimpled,
his face full of great blisters of diuers colours,
hauing in the middest a little touch of yellow,
and round about like a purple colour, and
all the rest of his skinne as it were inflamed
with heare, hee beganne to apprehend the danger
of the disease, that it was contagious, and
being very much astonished at the suddaine accident,
he asked Mannowry what he thought thereof,
but Mannowry iudged it fit to conceale it from
him at that time, seeing Sir Walter Raleigh had
not yet tolde him, that hee meant to flie out of
England, but that it was onely to gaine time to
satisfie his Maiestie.
                        Vpon Mannowry his vncertaine answere to
Sir Lewis Stucley touching Sir Walter Raleigh his
maladie, Stucley resolued to goe to my Lord Bishop
of Elie, now of Winchester, to relate vnto
him in what case Sir Walter Raleigh was, and
brought vnto Raleigh two Physicians to see and
visite him; who being come, could tell nothing
of what humour the saide sickenesse was composed.
There came also a third, a Bachelour in
Physicke, who all could not by all that they
could doe, discouer this disease; Onely they
gaue their opinion and aduise, that the Patient
could not be exposed to the Ayre, without manifest
perill of his life, and thereof they made
their report in writing, vnto which Mannowry
also set his hand.
                        Sir Walter Raleigh, seeing that all these things

fell out according to his intention, was exceedingly
contented thereat, especially that in
the presence of the sayde Physicians, the vomit
beganne to worke both vpwards and downewards.
And because he doubted that the Physicians
would aske to see his water, hee prayed
Mannowry to doe something to make it seeme
troubled and badde; which to content him,
(giuing him the Vrinall into his bedde) Mannowry
rubbed the inside of the glasse with a
certaine Drugge, which as soone as hee had
made water therein, the Vrine euen in the hands
of the Physicians, turned all into an earthy humour,
of a blackish colour, and made the water
also to haue an ill sauour, which made the Physicians
iudge the disease to be mortall and without
remedy, but from Heauen.
                        Hee made Mannowry also to tie his armes about
with blacke silke ribband, which hee tooke
from his Poyniard, to trie if it would distemper
the pulse, but that succeeded not, as hee thought
it would. The day following hee called Mannowry,
and prayed him to make some more such
blisters vpon him, as vpon his nose, his head, his
thighes, and his legges: which Mannowry hauing
done, it succeeded according to his desire, for
which he was very iocund and merry with Mannowry,
and sayde vnto him, that the euacuation
which his physicke had caused, had so opened
his stomacke, that he was exceeding hungry, and
prayed Mannowry that hee would goe and buy

him some meat secretly; for, quoth he, if I eate
publiquely, it will bee seene that I am not sicke;
so according to his request, Mannowry went to
the White-hart in Salisbury, and bought him a
legge of Mutton and three loaues, which he ate
in secret, and by this subtilty it was thought that
he liued three dayes without eating, but not without
drinke: Thus hee continued vntill Friday
the last of Iuly, seeming alwayes to be sicke in the
presence of company, and neuerthelesse, beeing
alone, hee writte his Declaration or Apology,
and prayed Mannowry to transcribe it, which was
since presented to his Maiestie.
                        The same euening Sir Lewis Stuckley discoursing
vpon his sickenesse, and whence it should
proceed, Sir Walter Raleigh saide in these words,
As God saue mee, I thinke I haue taken poyson
where I lay the night before I came to this Towne;
I know that Master Parham is a great louer of the
King of Spaine, and a Papist, and that hee keepes alwayes
a Priest in his house; but I will not haue any of
you to speake of it, nor you Mounsier (quoth hee)
speaking to Mannowry. Also Sir Walter Raleigh,
his Chamber doores beeing shutte, walked vp
and downe, and only Mannowry with him, there
naked in his shirt, and tooke a looking glasse,
and looking vpon the spots in his face, whereat
he tooke great pleasure, and laughing, said vnto
Mannowry these words, We shall laugh well one day,
for hauing thus cozened and beguiled the King, his
Councell, and the Physitians, and the Spaniards and all.
                        
                        
                           Vpon the Saturday that his Maiestie arriued
at Salisbury, which was the first of August,
Sir Walter Raleigh desired to speake with Mannowry
in secret, and seemed to haue a verie
great apprehension of some thing, and hauing
made him shut the doores, prayed him to giue
him a redde leather coffer, which was within
another coffer, which when hee had, hee was
a good while looking in it, and then called Mannowry,
and putting nine peeces of Spanish money
of gold into his hand, hee saide thus; There
is twenty Crownes in Pistolets, which I giue you for
your Physicall receipts, and the victuall you bought
mee; and I will giue you fiftie pound a yeere, if
you will doe that which I shall tell you, and if
it happen that Sir Lewis Stucley doe aske you
what conference you had with mee, tell him that
you comfort mee in mine aduersity, and that I
make you no other answere then thus, as is here
written, which hee had alreadie written with
his owne hand in a little peece of paper for Mannowries
instruction, as followeth:
                        Vela M. Mannowry L' acceptance de tout mes
trauaus, pertie de mon estat, & demon fils, mes
maladies & doleurs. Vela L' effect de mon confidence
au Roy. Which paper of Raleighs hand
writing Mannowry produced.
                        
                        And now Sir Walter Raleigh beganne to
practise with Mannowrie, and to tell him that
hee would flie and get himselfe out of England,
and that if Mannowry would aide him in his

escape, it was all in his power: and that Sir
Lewis Stucley trusted in no bodie but Mannowry;
whereupon Mannowry made him an ouerture,
that at his comming to London he should keepe
himselfe close in a friends house of Mannowries
in Shire-lane in London, whereunto he seemed
to encline, and found Mannowries aduise good
for a while; but in the end hee told him, that
hee was resolued otherwise, and that hee had
alreadie sent Captaine King to hire him a Barke
below Grauelend, which would goe with all
windes, and another little boate to carrie him to
it; For, quoth hee, to hide my selfe in London,
I should be alwayes in feare to be discouered by
the generall searchers that are there; but to escape,
I must get leaue to goe to my house, and being there,
I will handle the matter so, that I will escape out of
the hands of Sir Lewis Stucley by a backe-doore,
and get mee into the boate; for no bodie will
doubt that I can goe on foote, seeing mee so
feeble, as I seeme to bee. And then Raleigh
hauing mused a while, without speaking. Mannowrie
asked him, Sir, wherefore will you flie?
your Apologie, and your last Declaration, doe
not they iustifie you sufficiently? Then all in
choler, Raleigh answered him in English thus;
Neuer tell mee more; a man that feares is neuer secure;
which fashion of his put Mannowry to silence
for that time.
                        Now there rested nothing but his Maiesties
Licence, to permit him to goe to his owne

house, without which (hee sayde) hee could
nor possibly escape. This Licence was after granted
him by the meanes of Master Vice-chamberlaine,
and Master Secretarie Naunton; which
being obtained, Mannowry tooke occasion to
say to him, That heereby one might see, that his
Maiesty had no meaning to take his life, seeing that
hee suffered him to goe to his owne house to recouer
his health. No (quoth Raleigh) they vsed all
these kindes of flatteries, to the Duke of Byron,
to draw him fairely to the prison, and then they cut
off his head; I knowe that they haue concluded amongst
them, that it is expedient that a man should
die, to reassure the Trafficke which I haue broken in
Spaine. And thereupon brake foorth into most
hatefull, and Trayterous wordes against the
Kings owne Person, ending in a menace and
brauery, That if hee could saue himselfe for that
time, hee would plot such plots, as should make the
King thinke himselfe happy to send for him againe,
and render him his estate with aduantage; yea and
force the King of Spaine, to write into England
in his fauour.
                        
                        
                           Mannowry at that time did aske him further,
if hee escaped, what should become of
Sir Lewis Stucley? and whether hee should bee
put to death for him or not, and whether hee
should loose his Office and Estate? Not to
death (quoth Raleigh) but hee will bee imprisoned
for a while, but his landes the King cannot
haue, for that they are already assured to his eldest

sonne; and for the rest, it was no part of his care.
Mannowry further asked him, if it were not
Treason in himselfe to be ayding to his escape;
No (quoth hee) for that you are a stranger; neuerthelesse,
you must not bee knowne of any thing,
for then you will bee sure to bee put in prison. In
conclusion, Mannowry demaunded of him yet
further, But what if it be discouered, that I had any
hand in your escape? why (quoth hee) follow mee
into France, (that is your Countrey) and quit all,
and I will make you amends for all.
                        
                        After, Raleigh went on his iourney to Andolier,
and so to Hartford-bridge, and from thence
to Staines, during which time, Sir Lewis Stucley
being made acquainted by Mannowry with Raleigh
his purpose to escape, vsed extraordinarie
diligence in guards and watches vpon him;
which Raleigh perceiuing, saide to Mannowry
at Staines; I perceiue well, it is not possible for
mee to escape by our two meanes alone, Stucley
is so watchfull, and sets such strait guard vpon mee,
and will bee too hard for vs, for all our cunnings;
therefore there is no way but to make him of our counsell;
and if wee can perswade him, to let mee saue
my selfe, I wil giue him in hand two hundred pounds
sterling worth: and thereupon drew forth a Iewell,
and shewed it to Mannowrie, and gaue it
into his hand, made in the fashion of haile powdered
with Diamonds, with a Rubie in the middest,
which hee valued at a hundred and fiftie
pound sterling, and said, Besides this Iewell, hee

shall haue fiftie pound in money; I pray you goe tell
him so from me, and perswade him to it, I know he will
trust you.
                        
                        
                           Mannowrie went presently to Stucley, and told
him as before, and concluded with him, that
Mannowrie should report backe to Raleigh, that
hee would accept of his offer, and bade him
tell Raleigh also, that hee was content to doe as
hee desired; but hee would chuse rather to goe
away with him, then to tarie behind with shame
and reproach; and hee bade Mannowrie aske
him further, how hee thought hee could doe
this, without loosing his Office of Vice-Admirall,
which cost him sixe hundred pounds,
and how they should liue afterwards; and to
what place they should go, and what meanes he
would carie with him, to furnish this intended
escape; which Mannowrie did, and was
answered by the said Raleigh, and prayed to
tell Stucley, that if hee would sweare vnto
him, not to discouer him, hee would tell him
his whole intent; and that for the first point,
though Stucley should loose his Office, yet
hee should bee no looser vpon the matter; and
for afterwards, assoone as hee was gotten into
France, or Holland, his wife was to send him a
thousand pounds Sterling, and that hee caried
with him onely a thousand Crownes in money
and Iewells to serue for the present in his escape.
But after supper, Raleigh said vnto Mannowrie,
Oh, if I could escape without Stucley,
                           
I should doe brauely; But it is no matter (said
hee) Ile carie him along, and afterwards Ile dispatch
my selfe of him well enough. And after,
Mannowrie relating all that had passed, to
Stucley, brought them together, at which time
Raleigh shewed the Iewell to Stucley; and hee
making shew to bee content, prayed him a little
respite to dispose of his Office; whereupon
Mannowrie seeing them so accorded vpon the
matter in appearance, tooke his leaue of them
to goe to London; and in the morning Mannowrie
vpon the taking of his leaue, said to Raleigh,
that hee did not thinke to see him againe
while hee was in England; Whereupon Raleigh
gaue him a Letter directed to Mistris
Herrys of Radford, that shee should deliuer him
an yron fornace with a Distillatory of Copper
belonging vnto it, and charged him to tell euery
man hee mett, that hee was sicke, and that
hee left him in an extreme loosenesse that very
night.
                        BVt Raleigh hauing formerly dispatched
a messenger to London, to prepare
him a Barque for his escape,
came at last to London, and hauing wonne
his purpose, (by these former deuices of
feigned sickenesse) to bee spared from
imprisonment in the Tower, and to bee
permitted to remaine at his owne house,

till his better recouery; there fell out
an accident, which gaue him great hopes
and encouragement speedily to facilitate
his intended designe for escape. For as he
came on his way to London, in his Inne at
Brentford, there came vnto him a Frenchman
named La Chesnay, a follower of Le
Clere, last Agent here for his Maiesties dearest
brother the French King; who tolde
him that the French Agent was very desirous
to speake with him as soone as might
be after his arriuall at London, for matters
greatly concerning the sayd Sir Walters
weale and safetie; as in effect it fell out,
that the very next night after his arriuall at
London, the said Le Clere, and La Chesnay
came vnto him to his house, and there did
the said Le Clere offer vnto him a French
Barque, which hee had prepared for him
to escape in, and withall his Letters recommendatory
for his safe conduct and reception to
the Gouernour of Calis, and to send a Gentleman
expresly that should attend and meete him there;
to which offer of his, Raleigh after some
questions passed, finding the French Barke

not to bee so ready, nor so fit as that himselfe had
formerly prouided, gaue him thanks, and told
him that he would make vse of his owne
Barke, but for his Letters, and the rest of his offer,
he should be beholding to him, because his acquaintance
in France was worne out. So passionately
bent was hee vpon his escape, as
that hee did not forbeare to trust his life,
and to communicate a secret importing
him so neere, vpon his first acquaintance, and
vnto a stranger, whom he hath since confessed
that he neuer saw before. And thus after
two nights stay, the third night hee
made an actuall attempt to escape, and was
in Boate towards his Shippe, but was by
Stucley arrested, brought backe, and deliuered
into the custodie of the Lieutenant of
the Tower.
                        For these his great and hainous offences,
in actes of Hostilitie vpon his Maiesties
confederates, depredations, and abuses, as
well of his Commission, as of his Maiesties
Subiects vnder his charge, Impostures,
Attempts of escape, declining his
Maiesties Iustice, and the rest, euidently

prooued or confessed by himselfe; he had
made himselfe vtterly vnwoorthy of his
Maiesties further mercy: And because he
could not by Law bee iudicially called in
question, for that his former attainder of
Treason is the highest and last worke of
the Law (whereby hee was Ciuiliter mortuus)
his Maiestie was inforced (except Attainders
should become priuiledges for all
subsequent offences) to resolue to haue
him executed vpon his former Attainder.
                        HIs Maiesties iust and honourable
proceedings being thus made manifest
to all his good Subiects by
this preceding Declaration, not founded
vpon coniectures or likelyhoods; but either
vpon confession of the partie himselfe,
or vpon the examination of diuers
vnsuspected witnesses, he leaues it to the
world to iudge, how he could either haue
satisfied his owne Iustice, (his honourable
intentions hauing bene so peruerted
and abused by the sayd Sir W. Raleigh) or yet
make the vprightnesse of the same his intentions

appeare to his dearest Brother the
King of Spaine; if he had not by a Legal punishment
of the Offender, giuen an example,
aswell of terrour to all his other Subiects,
not to abuse his gracious meanings,
in taking contrary courses for the attaining
to their owne vnlawfull endes; as
also of Demonstration to all other forreigne
Princes and States, whereby they
might rest assured of his Maiesties honourable
proceeding with them, when any the
like case shall occurre: By which meanes
his Maiestie may the more assuredly expect
and claime an honourable concurrence,
and a reciprocall correspondence
from them, vpon any the like occasion.
But as to Sir Walter Raleigh his confession
at his Death, what he confessed or denied
touching any the points of this declaration,
his Maiestie leaues him and his conscience
therein to God, as was said in the
beginning of this Discourse. For Soueraigne
Princes cannot make a true iudgement
vpon the bare speeches or asseuerations
of a delinquent at the time of his

death, but their iudgement must be founded
vpon examinations, reexaminations,
and confrontments, and such like reall
proofes, as all this former discourse is made
vp and built vpon; all the materiall and
most important of the said examinations
being taken vnder the hands of the examinates
that could write, and that in the
presence of no fewer then sixe of his Maiesties
priuie Counsell, and attested by
their alike seuerall subscriptions vnder
their hands, which were my Lords, the
Archbishop of Canterbury, the Lord Verulam
Lord Chauncellor of England, the
Earle of Worcester Lord Priuy Seale, Master
Secretary Naunton, the Master
of the Rolls, and Sir
Edward Coke.
