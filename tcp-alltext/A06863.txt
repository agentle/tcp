            ¶TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE,
AND HIS ESPECIALL
good Lord, the Earle of Huntington,
Knight of the most noble
order of the Garter, &c.
Iohn Marbeck wisheth
a most happie and prosperous
estate, with
increase of vertue
in the feare of
GOD.
            
               AS THE CHILdren
of Israel had inestimable
cause to praise
the great goodnesse of
almightie God, and to
render condign thanks
vnto him for his most
mercifull deliueraunce
out of their vile captiuity
& bondage, which
they so long had susteined
vnder that proude
resister of Gods omnipotent
power, king Pharao; Euen so (Right honourable) are
we no lesse bound, to honour, lande, and praise the same
God with immortall thanks, which now of his entire loue,
pitie, and compassion (in this our last age of the world) hath
broken the yoke of our miserable seruitude, vnder that proud
exalter of himselfe, the Romish Antichrist, and of the bondmen
and slaues of that tyrant, hath made vs free men in his
sonne Iesus Christ through the true knowledge of his eternall
and euerlasting word. For as the people that dwel in the

country called Cimmeria do remaine in continuall darknes,
by reason they want the cleere light of the Sunne which is
so farre distant from them. So were we (poore soules) during
the time of our thraldōe vnder the power of the Pope in like
obscuritie shut & pend vp (as prisoners) in the darke dungeon
of his Antichristian iurisdiction, and alwaies constrained
to feed on the scraps of his owne vnsauery and most vnfruitfull
traditions & diuelish deuices, for lacke of the wholsome
foode of the Gospell of Iesus Christ, whereof the least little
sparke could not be permitted to put forth his light among
vs. But now (my good Lord) seeing that all the sleights and
grounds of the Popes inuentions (which wholy consisteth in
false superstitious worshipping, filthy Idolatry, fained hypocrisie,
foolish scrupulositie, with other the like) be cleerly sifted
and boulted out, from the boulting tub of his Canō laws
by infinit godly & learned writers, especialiye by such as bee
here expressed within this volume, it shall behoue vs to embrace
and lay sure holde on the profound saiengs of those so
godly writers, or rather vpon the truth vttered by their pens:
that being weaponed with such artillerie, we may be able to
resist & ouerthrow, whatsoeuer the whole Popish army shal
assay to assalt vs with all. For what is the cause that many at
this present day, do fall a lusting after Romish religion, as did
the Israelits to feed on the flesh pots of Aegypts gaine? But
that they despise to apparell themselues with the armour of
Christ, esteeming much better their old apparell of Popery,
although it seeme neuer so vile in the sight of God. Which
miserable and deceiued sort (but yet truly most wilfull & froward
people) that I might by the mercye of God in some
measure perswade, if not wholy conuert to the truth, I haue
the rather employed my diligence in collecting these common
places (sincerely expoūded by the authors themselues)
that in the reading and earnest study therof, there may some
sparke of Gods true knowledge, kindle aright vnderstanding
in them, which the Lord graunt, that his onely praise & glory
may therein be shewed. And now, Right honourable, hauing

as yet no help for the publishing of my Concordance,
which without speciall helpe is like to lye not onely helples,
but also fruitlesse, inclosed in an huge volume of mine owne
writing, wherein I haue spent many yeres, in purpose therby
to profit the studies of the godly affected, in the English
tongue, so that I am not able, as my meaning was, to exhibit
the same vnto you: I shall most humbly beseech your honor
to accept and take in good part, my simple trauailes in this
other worke, which God of his goodnes, in these mine olde
yeres, hath now brought forth in me: That I may not seeme
altogethers vnfruitfull to the Church of God, nor vnthankfull
vnto you mine especiall good Lord, but that at the least
a testification of my faithfull hart to Gods people, and of my
good will to your honour, may somewhat therein appeare.
For whom as dutie requireth, I wil remaine during life, a cō
               tinuall
intercessour vnto almightie God, that his blessings
may be multiplied vpon you, & that abounding in all good
gifts both of body and mind, you may enioy vpon this earth
a long, life, in perfect health and honour, to his glory,
and to the profit of others, and after the end
of your race, may be blessed for euer in
the felicitie of the faithfull.
            Amen.

                     Aaron was in nature a perfect man, and so was Christ and
more excellent in propertie, being without sinne. Aaron ministred
not for the peoples sake, but for his owne also being a sinner:
Christ for the people onelie, himselfe néeding nothing. Aaron
offered Sacrifice, but other things none of his owne: Christ
offered his Sacrifice, his owne, and himselfe. &c.

                  What Aarons Bels signified.
                  As Aaron with his succession was a liuelie figure of our Sauiour
Christ Iesu, who is the high Priest for euer, after the order
of Melchisedech, by whom they had all a full & perfect saluation,
that by him do come to God, liuing alwaies to this end, that
he maie appeare in the sight of God for vs.Exo. 28. f. ver. 33. So the golden Bels
that he was commanded to haue in the hem of his Tunicle did
signifie the earnest & liuelie preaching of the Gospell, whereby
Christ our sauiour and his Apostles did waken the world out of
the sléepe of death, as all good & faithfull ministers of the Church
following his example, and the example of the Apostles, ought to
doe. So doth Origen expound it saieng: Let also the high souereigne
Priest, haue bels about his garment, that when he goeth
into the holie place he maie giue a sound, and not enter into it
with silence. And these Bels that ought alwaies to ring, are put

in the hem of his Tunicle, which (as I beléeue) is done to this
end, that thou shouldest neuer hold thy peace of the latter daies,
and of the end of the world, but thou shouldest alwaies ring of it,
according to that that is said: Remēber the end, & thou shalt liue.

                  How it is the right name both of Satan and of the Pope.
                  WHose name in Hebrew is Abaddon.
                     Apoc. 9. b. ver. 11. ¶Abad in Hebrew signifieth
to destroie, whereof commeth Abaddon, as ye would
say a destroier, or destroieng, & in Gréeke Apollyō. For in Gréeke
Apollyon signifieth the same y• 
                     Abaddon doth in Hebrew. The
old translator in latin hath added, Habens nomen exterminans:
that is to saie in English, Hauing ye name of destroier. For Iohn
wrote in Gréeke, and passed for no more, but to be vnderstood of
them that knewe the Gréeke. And yet it must not séeme against
reason, that the auncient translator was desirous to haue the latine
men knowe what Apollyon signifieth, to the ende that all
men might beware of Antichrists wiles. For this name agreeth
verie fitlie to Satan, and to Antichrist his sonne. For like as
Satan is a murtherer from the beginning. Iohn. 8. ver. 44. and
vndid all mankinde with his naughtinesse: euen so hath Antichrist
with ye venime of his errours, led awaie an innumerable
multitude of men into deadlie, yea & spéedie destruction. In which
respect Paule tearmeth him the child of perdition. 2. The. 2 a. ver.

from it, by Apostasie, but also become most deadlie enimies therof,
biting & blaspheming it with their currish chaps: & finallie,

               ABHOMINATION OF DESOL.
               
                  Hovv this place of Daniel is vnderstood.
                  THese words of Christ & Daniel are diuerslie applied.Mat. 24 b. ver. 15. 
                     Origen
in Mat. Tract. 29. saith thus, Antichrist is ye abhomination of
desolation. S. Chrysost. in opere imperfecto. hom 44 saith:Dan. 9. g. ver. 27. This
Antichrist is called the abhomination of desolation, for y• he shall
cause the soules of manie Christians to be desolate & forsaken of
God. Greg. Nazianzenus saith: Antichrist shall come in ye desolation
of ye world, for he is ye abhomination of desolation. S Hierom
in Mat. cap. 24. saith: By the abhomination of desolation we
maie vnderstand all peruerse doctrine: he saith also, the abhomination
of desolation shal stand in the Church vntill the consummation
of the world,
lewel. fol. 446.
                  
                  ¶This Abhomination y• 
                     Daniel speaketh of, was ye wickednes &
Idolatrie of ye Iewes, wherewith almost all ye whole nation was
infected. It is called abhomination (which is as much to saie as
lothlines) because God lothed it as a most silthie thing, & it was
tearmed ye Abhomination & desolation for ye punishmēt y• ensued,
which punishmēt was ye desolation & wast of al ye Iewish people.
                  ¶Meaning (by desolation) that Hierusalem and the sanctuarie
should be vtterlie destroied, for their rebellion against God and
their Idolatrie: or some read that the plagues should be so great,
that they should all be astonied at them.

               ABIMELECH.
               
                  Hovv Abimelech is put in steed of Achis.
                  IN the title of the. 34. Psalme,Psal. 34. it is said that Dauid changed
his countenance before Abimelech. And in the first booke of
kings the. 21. Chapter the storie saith, he feigned himselfe before
Achis. Héere, séemeth to be a great contrarietie, & to make these
two places agrée, manie hath taken Ahimelech for Abimelech,
yet there is great difference in these two names, for Ahimelech
is as much to saie in latine, as Frater meus Rex, my brother the
King, and Abimelech is as much to saie in latine, as Pater
meus Rex, my Father the King. So that they cannot bée
all one name. But admitte it were so, yet it cannot

be true: for though Dauid did dissemble his aduersitie and persecution
before Abimelech the Priest, yet he did not chaunge
his chéere nor countenance before him, but made good semblance,
as though all had bene quiet betwéene king Saule & him,
and on the other side Dauid did intreat him friendlie and verie
gentlie, & not roughlie. But when he came before Achis, he fained
himselfe mad, as the storie saith. Therefore to make this
plaine, ye shall vnderstand that Abimelech, which is mentioned
in the title of the 34. Psal. is the selfe same person that is called
in the text Achis the king of Geth. So that Achis and Abimelech,
is all one person, and all one king. For like as the Emperours
of Rome, are called Caesars, of Iulius Caesar, & the kings of
Aegypt generallie called by the name of Pharao: so all the kings
of the Philistines, were generallie called by the name Abimelech.
And so in the one place, he is called by his generall name
Abimelech, & in the other by his proper name Achis. Bi. Turnar.
                  
                  ¶Whereas in stéede of Achis, there is put Abimelech,
it is a likelihood that the latter name was commonlie vsed among
the Philistines, like as the Aegyptians called their kings
Pharaoz, & like as the Romane Emperours haue borrowed the
name of Caesar of Iulius Caesar, who made himselfe ye first tyrant
among them. And we knowe that manie hundred yeares before
Dauid was borne, the kings that raigned in Gerar in the time
of Abraham, were called by the name Abimelech, wherefore it
is no meruaile that this name shall passe to their successors from
hand to hand, so as it should become common to all the kings of
Palestine.

                  THere is no where by expresse words had, anie such promise
made to Abraham: howbeit, it is conteined in the promises

which we haue in the Scripture. For God said to him, that his
séede should be multiplied, like the sand of the Sea,Gen. 22. ver. 17. & the starres
of heauen, Wherefore heerein consisteth the promise, This his
séede should fill the whole world. For they are not counted his
séede which haue procéeded from him onelie as touching the flesh,
but which imitate his faith. And forasmuch as such are dispersed
throughout the whole world, by them hath Abraham the inheritance
of y• whole world, which selfe thing, is verie expreslie spoken,Gen. 22. ver. 18.
when God made this promise to him: And in thy séede shall
all nations of the earth be blessed.

                     Luke. 16. ver. 20. doe vnderstand the faith of
Abraham. Other some also vnderstand it of the place, where the
elect and chosen that folowe the faith of Abraham do rest after
their death.Bosome. But where that place is (because the Scripture doth
not expreslie determine it) can we not tell. And therefore maie
no man be so bold, as to define it.

all nations be blessed) or Christ himselfe which came of the bosome
and seede of Abraham, or els the fellowship of them, that
died in the faith of Abraham.

the bosome of Abraham, because they receiued the fruit of the
same faith with him. So in the new Testament, we saie that the
members of Christ are ioined to their head, & gathered vnto him.
The Bosome signifieth y• most blessed life, which they that die in
the faith y• 
                     Abraham did, shall enioie after this world.

                  How Abrahams lie to Abimelech is excused.
                  
                     Abraham also is obiected, who said that Sara was his sister,Gen. 20. ver. 2. but
heerein (as Augustine teacheth) he lied not, he told that which
was true, but yet he spake not all the truth. And that is of no
man required, to vtter all that is true which he knoweth.Lie. He
did not tell that she was his wife: yet because she was his kinswoman,
he might according to the manner of the Hebrewes
trulie saie, that she was his sister: but he seemeth not to be vtterlie
excused: for although he lied not in calling her sister, yet
it séemeth that therein he fell, because in not opening that shée
was his wife, he put her in danger of léesing her chastitie, for

he left her naked of that aid, whereby onelie she might haue bene
defended from comming into strange loues. Neither is it necessarie
y• I shuld labour vtterlie to defend Abraham: for he was
a man & by ouer much feare he might easilie fal. Howbeit Augustine
mentioneth, y• 
                     Abraham was then in danger two manner
of waies: one, least he should be killed himselfe, the other was
the adulterie of his wife. The first daunger he might auoide, by
calling her sister: but the other, namelie, least she should be defiled,
he was not able to repell. For although he had said, that he
was her husband, that would not haue serued to haue deliuered
her from the filthie lusts of the Aegyptians. Wherefore he committed
vnto God, that which he himselfe could not turne from
him. And in that which he had in his owne power, he would not
tempt God. This séemeth to be Augustines Iudgement.
                  ¶He said to Abimelech, she is not my wife, but she is my sister,
which was true, for she was his sister by his fathers side,
but not by his mother, the daughter of Aran his brother, & consequentlie
of his father. Forasmuch as Fil

                  How Abraham did eate Christs bodie.
                  When this promise was established to Abraham,
                     Gen. 26. ver. 4. by the word
of God, which said: In thy séed shal all the nations of the earth be
blessed, he beléeued, which was counted to him for righteousnesse,
and did both eate his bodie,Eate. & drinke the bloud of Christ (through
faith) beléeuing verelie, that Christ should take our nature, and
spring out of his séede (as touching the flesh) & also that he should
suffer death to redéeme vs. And as Christ testifieth, he heartelie
desired to sée the daie of Christ, who sawe it, & reioiced, He sawe
it in faith,Ioh. 8. ver. 56 & had the daie of Christ, that is to saie, all those things
that shuld chance him plainlie reuealed vnto him, albeit he were
dead manie hundred yeres, before it was actuallie fulfilled & reuealed
vnto the world, & by that faith was he saued, & yet neuer
did eate his flesh with his téeth, nor neuer beléeued y• bread shuld
be his bodie, & wine his bloud. And therefore sith he was saued
without that faith, and the same faith shall saue vs that saued
him, I thinke we shall also be saued, if we eate him spirituallie
(as he did) although we neuer beléeue, that the bread is his

bodie.

                  THeir absolution also; iustifieth no man from sinne, for with

Paule. Rom. 10. ver. 10. that is, through faith & beléeuing the promises
are we iustified, as I haue sufficientlie proued in other
places with the scripture. Faith (saith Saint Paule in the same

that is sent from God and preacheth. Gods promises. Now
when they absolue in latine, the vnlearned heareth not, for how
saith Paule, 1. Cor. 14. ver. 16. when thou blessest in an vnknowne
tongue, shall the vnlearned saie Amen vnto thy

the laie man wotteth not whether thou loose or binde, or whether
thou blesse or cursse. In like manner it is, if the laie vnderstand
Latine, or though the Priest absolue in English, for in his
Absolution he rehearseth no promise of Christ, but speaketh his
owne words, saieng: I by the authoritie of Peter and Paule,

                  What difference is betweene fasting and Abstinence.
                  True fasting is a religious worke, ordeined to testifie our humilitie,
and to make the flesh the more obedient vnto the spirit,
that we maie be the quicker to praie, & to all good workes But
Abstinence from this or that meat with opinion of holinesse, supersticious

Paule saith: It is not meat that maketh vs acceptable vnto God.

grace, & not with meates, wherein they that haue walked, haue

& the bellie for the meate, the Lord will destroie them both. 1.

                        〈…〉
                     . Héere
it is easie to sée, that fasting is one thing, & abstinence from flesh
another. The Nazaries in the Testament absteined not from
flesh, & yet they fasted. Elias (3. Reg. 17. ver. 6.) was fed with flesh:
Iohn the Baptist, eate y• flesh of loc
                        •
                     stes, yet they both fasted. Socrates

saith, that manie Christians in y• Lent season, did eate fish
& birds: Manie ab

& then receiued all kind of meats, either fish or flesh, wtout difference.

Likewise Epiphanius saith, some eate all kind of birds or
fowle, absteining onelie from the flesh of foure footed beasts. And
yet they kept their lent trulie, & fasted as well as anie others.
Wherefore abstinence from anie one certeine kinde of meat, is
not of it selfe a work of religion to please God, but onelie a méere
positiue policie. S. Austine saith, Non quaero, &c. I demaund not
what thou eatest, but wherein thou hast pleasure. And Saint
Hierome saith of the Maniches, Ieiunant illi, &c. They fast in
déed, but their fasting is worse, then if they filled their bellies,

preuēted not God in this case: neither came he afore hand to
saie, If thou wilt giue mée leaue to beguile Achab, I will do
whatsoeuer thou wilt haue me to do, but God beginneth, saieng:
where shall I finde a lieng spirit to go and deceiue Achab? for I
sée he will néedes bée deceiued euen to the bottome of hell. And
wherefore is it that God speaketh so? Euen bicause the case stood
vpon executing of iust vengeance vpon an hypocrite, a despiser
full of crueltie, and a mortall enimie of all goodnesse. Achab
was a man that had peruerted all Gods seruice vtterlie, & was
wholie defiled with his owne Idols: and therewithall also is
full of sturdinesse and malice against the Prophets, and would
giue no eare to anie admonition. When he was thus hardened
in his sinnes, in such sort that a man could gaine nothing by
séeking to bring him into the right waie: after that God had
assaide all waies, and sawe hée was a man forlorne, when hée
held his assises, and demaunded who was he that would deceiue
Achab, for it was Gods will to execute the office of
a Iudge. Wée sée then, that when God meaneth to punish
wicked folke, and to execute his wrath vpon them according to
their deserts, hee tarrieth not till hée be moued to it by Satan,

                  Of the comparison the Apostle doth make betweene
Adam and Christ.
                  They also obiect vnto vs, that the Apostle compared Adam
with Christ, & said vnto ye

                     Rom. 5. 17. ye euen as in Adam we all
die, so in Christ we are all quickened. Wherefore by this meanes
they saie, ye the grace of Christ ought vniuersallie to be laid forth
vnto all men But if they wil so take this cōparison, they shall be
compelled to graunt, ye all shall by Christ be brought to felicitie,

as by Adam all throwne headlong into sinne, & into death

seeing that the thing it selfe declareth the contrarie, they maie
easilie perceiue that this similitude is not to be taken as touching
all the parts thereof, especiallie when as none fall of their
owne consent, into originall sinne: but these men will not haue
grace to be receiued, but through a mans owne consent. Wherfore
if they admit this difference, how dare they affirme that the
matter is on each side a like? The scope of the Apostle in this
comparison, is to be considered and beside the scope, nothing is
to be inferred. And in that comparison, Paule ment nothing els,
but that Christ is to those which are regenerate, the beginning
of life and blessednesse: as Adam is to them that are deriued
of him, the cause of death and of sinne. Now whosoeuer is afterward
beside this scope gathered touching the equalitie of multitude
or of the manner, the same is Per accidens, that is by
chance, and perteineth not vnto the scope and substance of the
similitude.

of their transgression. The word and promise was this: I shall
put enmitie betwéene thy séede and her séed, that séed shall tread
thoe on the head, and thou shalt tread if on the heele. In this promise
they had knowledge that Christ should destroie the diuell
with all his power, and deliuer his faithfull from their sinnes.
And where he said that the diuell should tread it on the héele,
they vnderstood right well, that the diuell should finde the
meanes, by his wiles and wicked ministers, to put Christ to
death. And they knewe that God was true, & would fulfill his
promise vnto them, and heartilie longed for this seede, and so
did both eat his bodie & drinke his bloud. Acknowledging with
infinit thankes, that Christ should for their sins take the perfect
nature of manhood vpon him, & also suffer the death. This promise
was giuen to Adam, and saued as manie as did beléeue
and were thankfull to God for his kindnesse.

                  Of the first Adam earthlie, and the second heauenlie.
                  The first man was of earth earthlie,3. Cor. 15. and the second man

the Lord himself from heauen. ¶As concerning Adam, it hath no
darknes in it at all. It is knowne how he is of the earth, & is called
earthlie. But where as Christ the second Adam is said to bée
from heuen, that is peruerted by heretiks. The true meaning of
it is, that Christ & Adam are alledged by the Apostle, as the two
heads in mankind, to this intent that he might expresse by them,
the condition of our mortalitie and glorification. As manie as be
of Adam be earthlie, and bearing the Image of their parent, subiect
vnto death and corruption. And this all we be vniuersallie.
On the other side, the elect which be borne not of bloud, nor of
the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God, they
be called héere heauenlie, albeit in flesh they be of Adam: and of
them it is reported, that they shall be such in the resurrection, as
the heauenlie Christ is also. If the Val

                     The opinion of the Valentinians and Euthichiās, confounded. and the Euthichians
doe gather of this, the one sort, that the flesh of Christ
commeth not of our flesh, the other sort, that it did not holde the
true nature of man: it followeth, that the flesh of the elect persons
also is of the verie same condition. For the Apostle saith
héere not onelie that the second man Christ is of heauen heauenlie,
but he addeth that also manifestlie saieng: And such as is the
heauenlie, such be they also that be heauenlie. And because you
shall not referre it to Angels, in knitting vp the matter he doth
conclude: Therfore, like as we haue borne the image of the earthlie,
so we shall beare also the image of the heauenlie. Wherfore
it appeareth that the Apostle doth attribute this vnto the faithfull,
bicause they do expresse in them both the Images of Adam
& of Christ, one of corruption & mortalitie, the other of incorruption
and immortalitie: So that in the former they do expresse the
earthlie Adam in that they do die & be corrupted: In the latter
they do expresse the heauenlie Adam, that is Christ, when they
shall rise in the end of the world, to glorifieng, immortalitie, and
incorruption. This is the true & right meaning of the Apostle,
which cannot stand, vnlesse we do graunt, that the flesh of Christ
was taken of our flesh without sinne, carried into heauen to the
glorie of immortalitie, through the coniunction of the word, and
the power of God. Otherwise we can haue no hope, that after
the Image of the earthlie man, we shall be like vnto the heauenlie.

of a Pickard, who came into the land of Boheme, and
said that he was the sonne of God, and named himselfe Adam.
And he commaunded all men and women to goe naked,Adamites. & that
whosoeuer desired to companie carnallie with anie woman,
should take her by the hand, and bring her to him and saie, hée
feruentlie desired her companie, and then would Adam saie: Go
together and increase and multiplie. This heresie was begun in
the yeare of our Lord. 1412. in the time of Sigismonde the Emperour.
And men suppose that it endureth yet, not onelie in Bohemia,
but in other places also.

                  TO Adde or take awaie from the word of God, is this: To
thinke otherwise, or teach otherwise of God, then he hath in
his word reueled. They takt from ye word, that beléeue lesse then
in his word is expressed. Those adde to the word: first, which
teach or decrée anie thing, either in matters of faith or ceremonies
contrarie to the word. Secondlie, such as make anie
religion or opinion of merits in anie thing that they themselues
haue inuented, beside the word of God. Last of all, they doe
adde to the word, which forbid that for a thing of it selfe vnlawfull,
which Gods word doth not forbid: and to make that
sinne, which Gods word doth not make sinne.

               ADOPTION.
               
                  How the Lawiers define adoption.
                  THE Lawiers, as it is had in the institutions, define Adoption
to be a legitimate an imitating nature, found out for their
solace and comfort, which haue no children. Further, they make
a distinction, betwéene Adoption and Arrogation. For Arrogation
they saie is, when he which is his owne man, and at libertie,
is receiued in stéede of a sonne. But Adoption is, when hee
which is receiued, is vnder an other mans power. Howbeit, the
lawes forbid, that the elder should be adopted of the younger:
for it séemeth a thing monstrous, that the sonne should erréed
the father in yeares. And therefore Cicero oftentimes vehementlie
inueigheth against that Adoption of Clodius. Now,
God adopteth vnto himselfe his elect, not for that he had not an
other sonne (for he had his onlie begotten sonne Christ in whom
he was well pleased) but for that in all the nature of man, he
had yet no children, for through Adam we were all made strangers
vnto him. Wherefore God for this cause, sent his naturall
and legitimate sonne into the world, that by him, he might
adopt vnto himselfe, manie children out of our kinde, &c.

condition, who also doth seale our saluation in our hearts
by Christs frée adoption, that we consider not God now as a rigorous
Lord, but as a most mercifull father. Gal. 4. 5. Geneua.

to them which doe choose & accept them for their children:
but they are it onelie by the loue & fauour of him which taketh
them for his children, & giueth them such right, as he might giue
to his naturall children. The like is wt vs towards God, séeing ye
of nature we were ye children of wrath, it doth then follow we be

not Gods naturall children, but that he maketh vs his children,
and counteth vs for such, by his onelie grace, which he sheweth
vs, because of the loue wherewith he hath loued vs in his welbeloued
sonne Iesus Christ, without anie of our deserts, but whollie

                  The same spirit beareth witnesse with our spirit.Rom. 8. 16. ¶Whereas
the Apostle saith, beareth witnesse together, he signifieth after
a sort that there are two testimonies of this adoption. The one is
our spirit, and the other the spirit of God. For it is no small or
light signe of this Adoption,Tvvo testimonies of our adoption. that we haue a quiet conscience, and
that we doe beléeue, that we are now reconciled vnto God: and
doe now féele, that we are refreshed and recreated with manie
other good gifts. Although these things are not sufficient for our
incredulitie and infirmitie. For there is none of vs which hath
his conscience so quiet, as we ought to haue: and which putteth
so much confidence in God, as we ought to doe. Wherefore séeing
the testimonie of our spirit is weake & infirme, God would
put to a confirmation of his spirit. For he it is which testifieth
together with our spirit, that we are the sonnes of God.

mischiefe followeth thereof. Dauid to saue his honour was
driuen to commit grieuous murther also. It is vnright in the
sight of God and man, that thy childe should be at another mans
cost, and be another mans heire. Neither canst thou nor thy mother
haue lightlie a quiet conscience to God, or a merie heart, as
long as it is so. Moreouer what greater shame canst thou doe
to thy neighbour, or what greater displeasure? What if it be neuer
knowne, or come anie child thereof? The precioust gift that
a man hath in this world of God, is the true heart of his wife,
to abide by him in wealth and woe, and to beare all infirmities
with him. Of that hast thou robbed him: for after she hath
once coupled her selfe with thée, she shall not lightlie loue him anie
more so trulie, but happelie hate him and procure his death.

Moreouer, thou hast vntaught her to feare God, and hast made
her to sinne against God. For vnto God promised she, and not to
man onelie. For the law of matrimonie is Gods ordinance. For

poore miserable man thus banished from the congregation,
to vtter dispairing. It is said that the Church forgiueth,
when either it doth comfort them that are troubled in conscience,
or receiueth the repentaunt into fauour againe.

                  In all the whole Bible is not this word Aduocate found: but
onelie in the first Epistle to Saint Iohn, the second Chapter, in
the which place it is said, that Christ is our aduocate to the
Father.

Father, Iesus Christ the righteous.
                  ¶Saint Austine vpon the place of Saint Iohn, saith: Iohn
dranke the secrets of hid mysteries, out of the Lords brest. Hée
(for all he was such a man) saith not you haue an aduocate with
the Father, but we haue an aduocate. He said not you haue me,
nor you haue Christ, but he put in Christ and not himselfe: and
he said, we haue, and not you haue. He rather put himselfe in the
number of sinners
to haue Christ his aduocate, then put himselfe
an aduocate in Christs stéed, and be found among the proud
damned. Brethren, we haue Iesus Christ the righteous an aduocate
with the Father, he is the mercie seate of our sinnes.
He that hath holden this, hath done no heresie: he that hath
holden this, hath done no scisme nor sedition.
                  ¶Christ is our onelie aduocate and attonement, for the office of
intercession and redemption are ioined together.

them their pitaunce, & giueth them to eate & drinke after his

authoritie ouer vs, to charge vs, and to giue vs such portion of
miseries, as he shall thinke good, &c.

(saith Gasper Megander) is to correct one to his behoose. And
therfore héere is to be noted the difference betwéene the afflictions
of the godlie & the vngodlie, for the godlie are afflictted to
their owne profit, namelie, that they maie be nurtured to patience,

                  There are two principall causes, whie God doth yéelde the
iust men to be punished of the vngodlie and vniust. The one is
for their exercise, the other for a speciall example. For exercise,
that they maie thereby, be trained, in faith, hope praier, and
praise of his name. Such a matter Paule expressed, saieng:
We will not haue you ignorant brethren of our trouble which
betided vs in Asia,
                     2. Cor. 1. 8. &c. The other is: the elect and godlie persons
be made examples of faith and patience, when they doe
with constant faith and sufferaunce, beare the struglings of
their afflictions in this world, and so doe shine as bright as
starres in the Church of the faithfull, &c.

of the Church are said to bée Christes afflictions, by
reason of that fellowshippe and knitting together, that the bodie
and the head haue the one with the other, not that there
is anie more néede to haue the Church redéemed, but that Christ
sheweth his power, in the dailie weaknesse of his, and that for
the comfort of the whole bodie.
                  As Christ hath once suffered in himselfe to redéeme his
Church, & to sanctifie it, so doth he dailie suffer in his members,
as partakers of their infirmities, and therefore a reuenger of
their iniuries.

his death, was put into an other bodie. An other, that Baptisme
was of no efficacie. The third, that there were two
Gods, one good and an other euill. And that of the good God
procéeded good thinges, and of the euill God euill things.
The fourth, that in hell were none other paines, then
be in this world. The fift, that the generall iudgement is past,
and that there is none to come. The sixt, that it is not lawfull
for anie man to swere. The seuenth, that a man hath no fréewil,
called in latine, Liberum arbitrium. The eight, that the matter
whereof the world was made, was not made of God, but is coeternall
with God. The ninth, that there is no originall sin. Also
that sinne conuneth not of frée-will, but of the diuell. The
tenth, they denied that the bodie should eftsoones arise at the
daie of iudgement. The eleuenth, they abiected all the
olde Testament, as a vaine thing, and of no authoritie.

the soule was put into an other bodie. And that Baptisme

               ALLEGORIE.
               
                  What the nature of an Allegorie is.
                  AN Allegorie is that which is, one in words, and an other in
sentence and meaning.
                  
                     
It is as much to saie, as straunge speaking or borrowed
speach, as when we saie of a wanton childe: This Shéepe
hath maggattes in his taile, hée must bée annointed with
Byrchin salue, which speach I borrowe of the Shepheard, &c.
Tindale.
                  
                  An Allegorie is, when the words are not transferred from
the proper signification, but sound one thing, and couertlie
shew foorth an other thing: as when it is said, that pearles
are not to bée giuen to Swine: héere euerie worde kéepeth
still his proper signification, and in them is taught that the
precious doctrine of God ought not to bée sette foorth vnto impudent
and obstinate men, &c.

fol. 327.
                  
               
               
                  What the true vse of an Allegorie is.
                  First, Allegories proue nothing (And by Allegories vnderstand
examples or similitudes borrowed of straunge matters,
and of an other thing, then that thou intreatest off)
And though circumcision be a figure of Baptisme, yet thou
canst not proue Baptisme by circumcision. For this argument
were féeble. The Israelites were circumcised, therefore
wée must bee baptised. And in like manner, though the offering
of Isaac were a figure or example of the resurrection,
yet is this argument naught: Abraham would haue offered
vp Isaac, but God deliuered him from death, therefore wée
shall rise againe, and so of all other. But the verie vse of Allegories
is, to declare and open a text, that it maie be the better
perceiued and vnderstoode. As when I haue a cleare
text of Christ and of his Apostles, that I must bée baptised,
then I maie borrowe an example of circumcision, to expresse
the nature, power, & fruite, or effect of Baptisme. For as circumcision
was vnto them a common badge, signifieng, that
they were all souldiers of God to warre his warre, and seperating
them from all other nations disobedient vnto God:
Euen so Baptisme is our common badge, and sure earnest,
and perpetuall memoriall, that wée perteine vnto Christ,
and are separated from all that are not Christes.
                  And as circumcision was a token, certefieng them that they
were receiued vnto the fauour of GOD, and their sinnes

forgiuen them: Euen so Baptisme certifieth vs that we are
washed in the bloud of Christ, and receiued to fauour for his
sake. And as circumcision signified vnto them the cutting away
of their owne lusts, and slaieng of their fréewill (as they call it)
to followe the will of God: euen so Baptisme signifieth vnto
vs repentaunce, and the mortification of our vnrulie members
and bodies of sinne, to walke in a newe life, and so foorth.
Tindale. fol. 15.
                  
               
               
                  Of two kinde of Allegories.
                  There are two kindes of Allegories. For some are set foorth
vnto vs by holie Scripture: as Christ is Ionas, who was
in the heart of the earth thrée daies, as he was in the bellie of
the Whale. Againe, that he is Salomon, or the serpent hanged
vp in the desert, or the Lambe: And that the two sonnes of
Abraham, are two testaments. Those I saie, for as much as
they are found in the holie Scriptures, maie in no wise bée
reiected, but are firme places, whereby when néede requireth
maie bée proued doctrines. There are other allegories, which
men through their owne iudgement and reason finde out, whom
indéede wée confesse, that they maie followe their owne fantasie,
so that they beware of two things. First that they deuise
nothing, that is repugnaunt to sound doctrine: Secondlie,
that they obtrude not those their deuises, as naturall and proper
sences of the holie Scripture.

preached to all men, without exception, & offer to all men
repentance, and will haue all men praied for.
Tindale.
                  
                  ¶The meaning of this foresaid text is, that God hath chosen of
euerie estate, condition, order or degrée of men, whom he will
haue to be saued, and to come to the knowledge of the truth.
Whereby we do learne, that God doth as well choose the king
as the subiect, and as well the subiect as the king, as well
the riche as the poore, and as well the poore as the rich. And

that there is no estate or condition of life, out of the which
he will not haue some to be saued, and come to the knowledge of
the truth.
I. Veron.
                  
                  ¶Héere we learne that God refuseth no nation, whether they
be Iewes or Heathen. Also that he refuseth no estate, whether
they be poore or rich, king or subiect, it is all one to him, he hath
no respect of persons, but will haue his Gospell to be preached
vnto al nations & estates, that such as be preordinated vnto life,
maie come to the knowledge of the truth.
Sir. I. Cheeke.
                  
                  ¶We take it to be spoken of all estates and kindes of
men, namelie that God will haue some of all kinde of men to be
saued, which interpretation agreeth excellentlie well with the
purpose of the Apostle. He had commanded that praiers & supplications
shuld be made for all men, & especiallie for kings, and
those which haue publike authoritie, that vnder them we maie
liue a quiet life in all pietie & chastitie. And therefore to declare
that no estate or kinde of men is excluded, he added, That God
will haue all men saued. As if he should haue said, no man is
letted by that vocation and degrée wherein he is placed, so that
it be not repugnaunt to the word of God, but that hee maie
come to saluation, and therefore we ought to praie for all kinde
of men. But héereof we cannot inserre that God endueth euerie
man with grace, or predestinateth euerie man to saluation:
as in the time of the floude all liuing creatures are
said to haue bene saued in the Arke with Noe, for that onelie
some of euerie kinde were gathered together in it. Or we maie
vnderstand it thus, that God will haue all men to be saued, for
that as manie as are saued, are saued by his will. As if a man
should saie of one that teacheth Rhetoricke in a citie, that he teacheth
all men. By which kinde of speach is not signified, that all
the citizens are learners of Rhetoricke, but as manie as learne,
are taught of him. And this also is like. If a man pointing to the

Pet. Mar. vpon the Rom. fol. 306.
                  
               
               
                  Obiection.
                  If God (saie they) would haue all men saued, how can
that stand firme and stedfast, that he hath chosen some onelie to

saue, and refused the rest.
               
               
                  Aunswere.
                  To this Saint Augustine saith thus: which would haue
all men saued, not that there should be no man, whom he
would not haue saued. Which would doe no vertue of miracles
amongest them which he said would haue done penaunce,
if hée had done them, but wée shoulde vnderstand by all
men, all sorts of men, distributed in certaine differences, kings,
priuate persons, noble and base, high and lowe, &c. And a litle after:
for the Apostle commaunded that they should praie for all
men, and speciallie he added for kings, and them that were in
high estate, which might haue bene thought to refraine from the
basenesse of the christian faith, for a loftinesse of courage, and a
worldlie pride. Therefore when he said, This is good before God
our sauiour, that is to saie, that we should praie also for such, hée
did adde by and by to take awaie desperation, Which would all
men to be saued. In another place he saith thus: But as that
which is said, All shall be restored to life in Christ, whereas for
all that manie are condemned to eternall death, it is said therefore,
because that all, as manie as doe enioie euerlasting life, doe
not enioie it but in Christ: so the same that is spoken, God wil
haue all men saued, whereas he willeth not to haue so manie saued,
it is spoken therefore, because that they which be saued, are
not saued but as he willeth. And in case these words of the Apostle
maie be anie otherwise vnderstood, so that for all that they
maie not be contrarie to this most manifest truth, wherein wee
doe sée so manie not saued, where as men would, and God willeth
not. This saith Augustine. Whereby we doe sée that the
words of the Apostle are not so to be taken, that of all men God
hath refused none, but that he would haue no sort of men shutte
out from his saluation and knowledge of the truth, &c.

               ALMES.
               
                  What almes signifieth.
                  THis word Almes, importeth as much as mercie. Now we sée
that among other titles, God challengeth this vnto himselfe,
that he is gentle and mercifull. Then can we not be his
children, neither will he acknowledge vs for such, except we labour
to followe his example in this behalfe: namelie to be moued
to pitie when we sée anie poore folke in aduersitie, and to go
about to prouide for them, euerie of vs according to his abilitie.
True it is, that we maie giue all our substaunce, and yet our
doing shall not be counted a vertue. For before the hand be opened
to giue, it behoueth the heart to be touched with compassion:
but if we haue pitie of those which are in aduersitie, it behou
                        •
                     th
vs also to succour them to our power. For (as 
                        
                           •••
                        ames
saith) If I saie to a poore man, my friend God helpe thée, thereby
I shew that I haue no loue in me. If I saie, it is great pitie of
this man, and yet in the meane while labour not to succour him
whom I ought to relieue it is a mockerie, & I am but an hypocrite.
That is to saie, I sée there how God sheweth me a pitifull
case, & it is as much, as if God gaue me occasion to emploie my
selfe, & thereby I sée that he calleth me, & yet in the meane time,
I make no countenance of it at all. If there were but one drop
of kindnesse in me, would I not endeauour to helpe such a necessitie
for my part. So then we haue to beare in minde in this
text, that the holie ghost exhorteth vs to almes déedes, & that the
same consisteth in two points, that is to saie, in being pitifull towards
our neighbors when we see thē in aduersitie,& also, when
we haue such pitiful affection, as we séeke the meanes to succour
them, & euerie man straineth himselfe to his power. True it is
that we cannot stead all the necessities that we sée And therefore
a christian man maie well mourne in his heart, without putting
his hand to his pursse. For it is impossible (euen for them that
be best minded) to helpe at all times. And therefore this pitifulnes
shall suffice them, & God accepteth it for an Almes déede, as
if the poore were norished, and fed by them. And when they haue
this compassion vpon a poore man, it is as great a Sacrifice vnto
God, as if he had giuen and dealt dole out of a full pursse, &c.
Caluin vpon Iob. fol. 535.
                  
                  ¶Almes déeds properlie is mercifulnesse, notwithstanding vse

and custome hath brought to passe that almes is called a gifte,
that of compassion and mercie is giuen vnto him that néedeth.
But in that diuersitie, there lieth no waight nor force, whether
thou read righteousnesse or almes, because it is manifest inough,
that by them both, the vice of ambition is reprooued, which in doing
wel, looketh to haue praise of men, as did the Scribes & Phariseies,
of whom Christ speaketh thus: All that they doe is to
be séene of men. He forbiddeth not héere to doe well in the sight
of men, but that we should not doe it to this end, to be commended
of them. For otherwise it is lawfull for vs to giue our almes
publikelie, so that our minde haue respect vnto God, and brotherlie
loue to men and the praise of men.

                  An exposition of this place following.
                  Giue almes,Luk. 11. 41. and all things are cleane vnto you. ¶These
words maie be expounded thrée manner of waies. The first waie
is, to saie that that kinde of speach was anie Ironie, as if Christ
should haue said to the Phariseies: ye giue almes, and ye think
                        •
                     
straight y• all things are cleane vnto you, which is not so, for we
ought first to make cleane those things which are within. An
other waie is, which Augustine followeth in his Enchiridion to
Laurentius: certaine had perswaded themselues, that if they gaue
almes they shuld be saued, though they ceased not from sinning, &
their chiefest anker hold, was these words of Christ. Augustine
answereth, that those words of Christ, are to be vnderstood of the
true & approoued almes: of which it is written in Eccl
                           •
                        . the. 30.
Chapter: Haue compassion of thy soule, and please God. Wherefore
thou oughtest to begin true almes at thine owne selfe: that
hauing compassion on thy selfe, thou maist be conuerted vnto
God, and cease of from sinnes, and afterward haue compassion on
oth
                        •
                     rs. And the third waie is this, which in my iudgement more
agréeth vnto the purpose: Christ being at dinner with the Phariseies,
he began to eate with vnwashed hands: for which thing
when they were offended, Christ beganne to reprooue their ignoraunce,
which would haue their dishes, handes and all outward
things made cleane and beautifull, but as touching that
which they had inward, that is, in their minde, they were
nothing carefull. Wherefore he first exhorted them to purifie the
heart which is inwardlie, which thing is done by faith: for
in the Actes it is written, By faith purifieng their hearts.

Afterward as touching outward things he addeth: Giue almes,
and so all things shall be cleane vnto you, &c.

Secondlie, that we giue liberallie,2. Cor 9

as he is able. The poore woman that did offer but two mites,Mar. 12. 42

glorie.

thankes vnto God, so that by our almes, two profits shall ensue
and followe. First, our poore bretheren shall be succoured & helped:
secondlie, God the Author of all goodnesse shall be (through
the same liberalitie that he hath stirred vp in vs) be praised and

giue, be in no wise thereby, brought to extreme penurie and pouertie,

at ease & in idlenesse. This is the equalnesse that S. Paule
speaketh of héere. The Corinthians had riches, & the Saints of
Hierusalem had wholesome doctrine coupled with godlinesse (at
that time there was great dearth in Hierusalem, and in all Syria)
This is then the meaning of the Apostle: I will that with
your riches (whereof ye haue great plentie & abundance) ye succour
their néed, and that they, with their godlie doctrine, do supplie
that which is wanting in you.

poore estate of a man, and sheweth forth it selfe by some gift, and
hath the name giuen it of the Gréeke tongue, of mercie and compassion.
And therefore he is said to giue Almes, who parteth
with some thing to another, and giueth to the poore, shewing
thereby, that he pitieth their poore estate.

               ALTAR.
               
                  What an Altar is, and how they began.
                  AN Altar is nothing els, but a thing builded to offer Sacrifices
on. Altare is a Latin word, which is so named as the
Gramarians doe saie, of Altitudo or height. Not that an Altar
is so great and high, but because the Romaines before the receiuing
of the true religion of Christ, they made Altars, in thrée
sundrie places. Some they called Altaria, vpon the which they
did offer Sacrifices vnto the supernall Gods. Other Altars
they had which were made beneath vpon the plaine ground,
vppon the which they did Sacrifice vnto the Gods on the
earth. And other Altars they made vnder the earth, (as were
in Poules,) vpon the which they did offer Sacrifice, Dijs infernalibus,
vnto Gods vnder the ground. And these two
last kinde were called Ara or A
                           •
                        e, but the high Altars were
properlie called Altaria.
                  
                  
                     
Thus much concerning the name of the Latin word Altare. In
all the newe Testament where we read this Latin word Altare,
as in the 5. of S. Mathew, the first of S. Luke, 1. Cor. 9. & the
13. of the Hebrewes. In all these places in the Gréeke booke is
red 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . Which word is as much to saie in English, as a
Sacrificing place, or a thing made to offer sacrifices on, which is
more plaine then the Latin word Altare is So that an Altar is
nothing els but a sacrificing place, or a thing made to offer sacrifices
on. When Noe was preserued from the generall Deluge,
with his wife and his thrée sons & their wiues & restored againe
by the tender mercie of God to drie land, he made an Altar vnto
the Lord, and offered all manner of cleane beasts and foules
thereon for a sacrifice, with whose doings the Lord was well
pleased, because he did it in the faith of Christ, which was figured
by the Altar, and promised neuer to drowne the world anie
more for mans wickednesse, &c. Upon the same faith did Abraham,
the father of all faithfull beléeuers, make an Altar vnto the
Lord, what time as God promised vnto him, that in his séede
(which was Christ) should all the nations of the earth be blessed.
Likewise God commanded 
                        
                           •
                        acob to build an Altar at Bethel,
in the remembrance that he had deliuered him, from the
hands and crueltie of his brother Esau. Thus in the lawe of nature
Altars began. But chiefelie they did flourish, after the law
of the ten commandements were giuen by Moses. We read
that God warned Moses to kéepe the people from making of
Gods of gold or of siluer, and to kéepe them the better from it,
thou shalt (said he) cause them to make an Altar not of gold nor
siluer, but make vp a litle heape of earth, and therevpon do thou
offer the burnt-offerings, & the peace-offerings. And if the people
be desirous to build an Altar of stone, thou shale not suffer it
to be made of hewen stone, but of rough stone, after the rudest
fashion, that the people take not a superstitious conceit, reposing
a confidence in the Altar it selfe, and not in the thing that is signified
by the Altar, which is Christ. Yet all this while, there
w
                        •
                     re no perfect forme n
                        •
                     r fashion of Altars, till the Tabernacle
of the tastimonies was made. When that was once made, then
Altars grew
                        •
                      to their perfection. For then God commanded to
make two Altars for the Tabernacle, the one was called the Altar
of incense, which Altar was made of Sethim wood, & aboue

couered ouer with fine gold. The other Altar was made also
of Sethim wood, but aboue, it was couered ouer onelie with
Brasse, and therefore sometimes it is called the brasen Altar.
                  This Altar was properlie called the Altar of burnt-offerings,
vpon this Altar was offered euerie daie two Lambes, one in the
morning, and the other at night, beside an innumerable sort of
other Leuiticall Sacrifices. Now marke, in these two Altars,
ye must consider, that it was a part of the Ceremoniall Lawe
of Moses, all which Lawe was but a figure; and a shadowe of
Christ the true light it selfe. As the Apostle saith: The Ceremoniall
lawe was but a shadowe of good things, that were
then to come, and giuen by Christ. But nowe h
                        •
                     er
                        •
                      maie bée
thought: séeing that Altars were vsed from the beginning of
the world: First in the lawe of Nature, second in the law written,
by commandement giuen by Moses the man of God, thirdlie
frequented and vsed in Christs Church, since the beginning
and vsed to this daie in most places of Chris
                        •
                     endome,
how is it then that the Church of England hath taken them awaie.
To this I aunswere, that wheresoeuer Altars be vsed,
(whether in England or in anie other places of Christendome)
they be an occasion of great Idolatrie, & blaspheming of Christs
bloud, and merits of his bitter passion. For whereas by Christs
one Sacrifice offered vpon the Altar of the Crosse, we are all
made cleane, and inheritours of the kingdome of heauen: our
Altars did teach vs, that he was offered vp there a newe euerie
daie for our redemption by the worke of a priest, which is most
fal
                        •
                     e and vntrue, and most blasphemous & iniurious to Christs
merits and sacrifice offered once for all. And to the end to plucke
out this blasphemous opinion out of the simple peoples heads, it
ought to be iudged of all the Kings people, as good a déede of the
King and his Counsell to beate downe and destroie the Altars
in England, as that King Ezechias did, when he brake and brent
the brasen Serpent, that Moses by the commandement of God
did make, because the people did worship it, and so committed
Idolatrie. Though that Altars were well accepted at the
handes of Noe, Abraham, Isaac, Iacob, and also commaunded
during the time of Moses Lawe, yet ye must vnderstand, that
that Lawe is now abrogated, and vtterlie repelled. The whole
Lawe giuen by God to Moses for the people of Israel, was deuided

into thrée fortes: lawes morall, which is the lawe of the
ten commaundements, lawes Iudiciall or Ciuil lawes, which
we in the realme of England call temporall lawes: The third
kinde of lawes were Ceremoniall lawes. The lawe of the ten
Commandements doe stand in their first strength. But the other
two, the lawe Iudiciall, and the lawes ceremoniall, are quite
abolished and of no strength. Since that Christ hath suffered
his passion for our redemption. And where as no nation vnder y•
Sunne were so laden with Ceremonies as the Iewes were.
God did it for two purposes. One was to kéepe the people from
the idolatricall inuentions of their owne handes and of their
owne heads. The other was, with pretie figures and shadows
to induce the grose and stifnecked people, to inbrace and beléeue
the mysteries of Christes incarnation, passion, and resurrection,
which mysterie was principallie figured and sette out by their
shadowes and figures of the lawe. So that there was not a ceremonie,
but it was a figure of Christ or his Apostles, or els of
his misticall bodie the Church: all which Ceremonies and figures,
after that Christ had once suffered, which was figured by
them, they were all banished awaie out of Christs Church, because
there was no vse for them. For like as when it is darke,
the light of a candle is good, but when the night is past, & the day
is come, why should we occupie anie longer a candle. Euen so,
when Christ was come, and had suffered, which was the end of
the lawe, what shoulde we do with the Ceremonies and figures
of Christ, but vtterlie to cast them awaie as a burden, not onelie
necessarie, but also as Saint Peter saith importable. And
now being deliuered from the seueritie of the Iudiciall Lawes.
And multitude of the Ceremoniall Lawes, he that goeth about
to retaine anie one or part of them, to him maie well be spoken
the words of Saint Paule: If ye will néedes be circumcised,
Christ doth profite you nothing. For hée that is circumcised
is bound to keepe the whole Lawe: so they that will haue
Altars to stand by the force of Moses lawe, they must by the
same reason, haue all the whole Tabernacle to stand, with the
furniture thereof, which is a falling awaie from Christ.

Lawe to eate, he vnderstandeth by the Altar, the Sacrifice
that was offered vpon the Altar, of the which the Priests did
eate, they did not eate of the verie Altar, for then they should
haue eaten stones and mortar, but they did eate the Sacrifice
offered vpon the Altar. And as they had a sacrifice carnall, wherof
they did eate, so haue we a spirituall Sacrifice which is
Christ, whom we doe eate by faith spirituallie. And to the
mysticall eating of Christ and drinking his bloud, it skilled not

of the Altar, they vnderstood none other thing by it, but the Table
or boord that they vsed in their Communion, which (I say)
they called an Altar, alluding to the Altars of the olde Lawe,
and hauing respect to the Sacrific
                        •
                      of praise and thankesgiuing,
that was offered by the Church in the Supper of the
Lorde. This was the state of the Church concerning this
matter in Saint Austines time, who was about foure hundred
yeares after the Ascencion of our Sauiour Iesus
Christ, at the which time the Church beganne wonderfullie

to growe out of kinde.

Preachers of the Gospell ought likewise to liue of the Gospell.
S. Austen vpon this word Altar saith: The Altar signifieth the
Altar of the Iewes. So that by this place, the Papists cannot
stablish their Altars.
                  That part that was burnt, was deuoured of the Altar: and
the other was due vnto the Priests by the Lawe.

in Thuringe was a Preacher named Monetarius which taught
openlie that he would reforme the state of the Church, and made
aduaunt priuelie, that reuelations were shewed to him by God,
and that the sword of Gedeon was committed to him, to ouerthrowe
the tyrannie of the Impius. He led out great companies,
commaunding them to spoile and rob Monasteries, and the palaces
of great men. But while the vnrulie people were scattered
and disseuered without order, the Princes of Saxonie sodainlie
oppressed them, and tooke their Captaine, whome they put to
death.
                  This Monetarius was the first Author of the diuelish sect of
heresie, of the Anabaptists which long time after vexed Germanie,
and is not yet altogether extinguished.
                  The Anabaptists caused great trouble and rufling in the
North parts of Germanie, and at the Citie Monstere, choosing
to their King one Iohn a leade (a Coblar as saith Sledane)
exercised much crueltie, expelling other out of the Citie
that would not condescend vnto their beliefe. This Iohn a leade
in token that he had both heauenlie and earthlie power, gaue to
his Garde gréene and blew, and had for his Armes the figure of
the world, with a sword thrust through it. He married himselfe
fiftéene wiues, and ordeined that other should haue as manie as
they listed, and all other thinges to bée common amonge
them.
                  The Bishop of Monstere by the aide of other Princes besieged
the Citie against the rebellious Anabaptists fiftéene or
sixtéene monethes. In which time the stubborne and froward
people sustained so great scarsitie and hungar, that they béeing
aliue were like dead corses, and did eate commonlie dogs, cats,
mice with other wilde beasts, and séething hides, leather, and
olde shooes, did powne the same and make bread thereof. After
long siege, the Citie was wonne, spoiled and destroied with
great crueltie and slaughter of that wicked people.

and that one of the chiefe. But in holding part backe, he declared
vtterlie what he was, that is, subtill and an hypocrite, mistrusting
the Holie ghost, which thing because Peter would in no
condition should be vsed among that sort, therefore punished hée
it so earnestlie.

                  Was it not thine owne,Act. 5. 4. and after it was sold, was it not in
thine owne power, &c. ¶By this place we maie euidentlie sée,
that in the Primitiue Church, no man was compelled to make
his goods common, for Peter telleth plainlie, that it did lie in Ananias
power, whether he would sell his land or no, and when
he had sold it the moneie was his owne, so that he might haue
kept it, if he had lusted.

                  What an Angell is.
                  
                     
ANgell, is a Gréeke word, and signifieth messenger, and all
the Angels are called messengers, because they are sent so oft
from God to man on message. Euen so, Prophets, Preachers,
and the Prelates of the Church, are called Angells, that is to say
messengers, because their office is to bring the message of God
vnto the people. The good Angels héere in this booke, are the true
Bishops and Preachers, and the euill Angels are the heretikes
and false preachers, which euer falsifie Gods word, with which
the Church shall be thus miserablie plagued, vnto the end of the
world.
Tindale.
                  
                  This word Angell hath vndoubtedlie sprong from the Gréeke
word 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . Which in Latin is as much to saie as Nuncius,
a Messenger. By the which it is plaine that Saint Augustine
saith: Angelus non nature, sed officij nomen est. As I am a
man naturallie, but I am a priest, a preacher by office. So naturallie
an Angell is a spirit, but when he is sent on message, then
is he an Angell. Saint Augustine defineth an Angell on this
wise: Angelus spiritus est, substantia in corpora, inuisibilis, rationabilis,
intellectualis, immortalis. An Angell is a spirit, that
word Spiritus is in the place of Genesis a spirit, that is a substaunce
bodilesse, or a substaunce without a bodie, inuisible, endued
with reason, vnderstanding and immortall. They eate not,
they drinke not, they marrie not, they sléepe not, but liue euermore
in heauenlie ioie and fruition of God, fulfilling his blessed
will and pleasure, with all readinesse, without anie wearinesse
or slacknesse, and therefore we saie in the Lords praier: Fiat
voluntas tua, sicut in coelo & in terra. They serue God, not
with crieng of the mouth, for they haue none, but with crieng
of minde, and that they doe continuallie. And as Esay the Prophet
saith, these be part of their holie crieng, Sanctus, sanctus,
sanctus, Dominus Deus Sabaoth. As they are without bodie,
so they occupie no circumscriptiue place, that is to saie, no bodilie
place, no seuerall nor quanticatiue place, and yet their intellectiue
and spirituall place is so, that when they be in Heauen
they be not in earth. And contrarie when they be in earth
they be not in Heauen. For there is no power finite, that can
be in two places at once. And if ye will knowe saith Saint Austen,
how Angels doe eate and drinke, yée shall vnderstand,
that Angels taking vpon them the visible and tangible bodies

of men, Edent habent potestatem, sed non necessitatem.

                  Wherefore Angels were made.
                  An Angell is the creature of God, in spirituall vnderstanding,
mightie, made to serue God in the Church, from which end
of their creation, some are fallen and become enimies of the
Church. Other that fell not, but continued in their innocencie,
doe serue to God and his Church.
               
               
                  How Angels ought not to be worshipped.

                        ca. vlt. to beléeue that the bountifull
Angels, and the most excellent ministers of God, will haue
vs worship one God with them, by whose contemplation they
are all blessed. Neither doe we build temples for them, for they
will not be so honoured of vs, because that they knowe that
when we are godlie, we are the Temples of God. Therefore it
is well and rightlie written, that man was forbidden of the Angell
to worship him, but one God, vnder whom he was his fellow-seruant.
               
               
                  How this place following is vnderstood.
                  Which after his owne imagination,Col. 2. 18. walketh in the humblenesse
and holinesse of Angels. ¶By religion of Angels, saith
the olde translation. Erasmus, By superstition of Angels. What
S. Paule meaneth héere I cannot well tell,Humblenesse, holinesse, religion, or superstition of Angels. except he meane that
false Apostles phantasied some hie honour & worship, to be giuen
to holie Angels, if they kéepe y• law giuen by the ministration
of holie Angels: and those to displease the Angels, y• kéepe
not the lawe giuen by Angels: & holie Angels to honour them,

So these Pseudo Apostles taught it to be a worshipping of
Angels, to obserue y• lawe & the workes of the lawe, as necessarie
to saluation, which thing S. Paule counteth here, no honour
nor worship of Angels, but superstition of Angels, a pretence to
honour Angels, & do dishonour them, & most rebuke to Angels
that can be done. Or els this place maie be otherwise expounded

it is not for that God hath resigned his owne office vnto them,
it is not for that he hath dispoiled himselfe of his owne power,

it is not for that he himselfe abideth idle in heauen: But it is
for that the Angels are instruments of his power, to the ende it

sonnes of the Gods,Psal. 89. 6. because they neither haue had their beginning
of the earth, nor are clad with corruptible bodies, but are
heauenlie spirits, endued with the glorie of God. Not y• they bée
anie part of gods being or substance as brainsick persons dreame:
but because God vttereth his mightie power in them, therfore is
their nature distinguished from ours by this title. The effect
thereof is that although there shine foorth a greater maiestie is y•
Angels then in other creatures, insomuch that they rauish vs to
wonder at them, yet come they nothing néere vnto God, that
they should dimme him with their excellencie, or part stakes of
souereigntie with him: which thing is to be marked aduisedlie,
because y• although God do euerie where auouch y• Angels to bée
but seruāts & redie at his cōmaundement, yet y• world being not
contented wt the one God, forgeth to it selfe many Gods.

                  How Angels appearing in humaine bodies were not men.
                  Two things are diligentlie héere to be weighed. One is, whether
Angels when they after this sort put on humaine bodies,
maie be called men: I think not. For if we vnderstand humaine
flesh, which is formed & borne of a resonable soule, vndoubtedlie
Angels after that manner cannot be said to haue hamaine flesh.
What then will some men saie? Were the sences deceiued whē
men sawe them? Not so. For the sences iudge onelie outward
things, & such things as appeare. But what inwardly impelleth
or moueth these things which they sée they iudge not. That longeth
to reason to séeke & search out. This also is to be added, that
Angels did not continuallie retaine these bodies, bicause they
were not ioined to them, in one and the selfe same substaunce:
so y• an Angel & a bodie were made one person. The holie Ghost
also although hée was a true Doue where he descēded, yet was
not he together one substance with it, whe
                        •
                     fore the Doue was
not y• holie Ghost, not y• holie Ghost the Doue. Otherwise Angels
may (as we haue before taught) enter indéed into a body before
made, & which before had his being, as it is read of y• Angel
which spake in y• Asse of Bala
                           •
                        m, and of the diuell, which by the

Serpent talked with Eue. But at this present we dispute not
of that kinde, but onelie saie, that Angels working in this manner
in the bodies of creatures, are not ioined vnto them in one
and the selfe same substaunce. Wherefore, the asse could not bée
called an Angell, neither was the Angell an Asse, euen as the
Serpent was not in verie déede the diuell, neither was the diuell
the Serpent.

                  Whether Angels did in verie deede eate and drinke
when they appeared.
                  Of the Schoole-men, some thinke that they did eate in verie
déede, and other denie it. Scotus thinketh that to eate is nothing
els, then to chawe meate, and to conueigh it downe into the
bellie, and this thing did the Angels, wherefore he gathereth,
that they did eate in verie déede. Other doe thinke, that to eate,
is not onelie to chawe the meate, and to conueigh it downe into
the bellie, but moreouer to conuert it into the substaunce of
his bodie by concoction through the power of vegitation. This
forsomuch as the Angels did not, therefore they did not eate in
verie déede. The booke of Tobias is not in the Canon of the
Hebrewes, but yet it might be applied to our purpose, but that
there is variance in the copies, for in that booke which Munster
set out in Hebrewes, in the twelfth Chapter. Raphel the
Angell saith: I séemed to you to eate and to drinke, but I did
not eate neither drinke, the common translation hath: I séemed
to eate & to drinke, but I vse inuisible meate and drinke. Neither
text denieth, but that the Angell after a certeine manner
did eate.

Psal. 103. The spirits be Angels, & when they be spirits, they be
not Angels, when they be sent they be Angels, for Angell is the
name of the office, & not of nature. Respecting that whereof hée
is, he is a spirit: and in respect of that which he doth, he is an
Angell, Who maketh (saith the Apostle) Angels his spirits: y• is

of the Hebrewes. They be all serueable spirites sent for the
health of the elect.

as Christ the onelie begotten of God, but that they be created
of God, and made in like sort as the rest of the creatures. That
they bée not gotten of God as Christ was. The Apostle witnesseth
where he saith:Heb. 1. 5. To which of his Angels did he saie at
anie time: I haue begotten thée this daie: and againe, I will
be to him a Father, and he to me a sonne: but whereas in Iob,
the Angels bée called the sons of God, it is not to be vnderstood,
that they be the naturall sonnes of God as Christ was, but because
they be the sonnes of grace and adoption, as all the elect
bée. That they be created and made, the Prophet Dauid witnesseth
Psalme. 148. 2. But when and what time they were
made, there is no mention in anie place of Scripture. A
man maie gather that they were made at that time, when the
foundation of the world was set, by that we do read in Iob. 38.

of the Apostle himselfe,Heb. 1. 7. in the 
                        〈…〉
                      4. ver. following, where according
to this testimonie, he hath defined their nature, and called them
ministring spirits. Then in these words he maketh his Angels
spirits, and his ministers a flaming fire, according to the similitude
in which their glorie hath bene séene: as the Angels that
were with Elize

The similitude of the beasts which Ezechiel saw, were as coles
of burning fire: and the Seraphins haue their names, because
they be of firie coulour. And these words spirits & ministers, we
must resolue thus, ministering spirits.Angells are ministring spirits. So out of this text his argument
standeth thus: Christ is called the sonne, the first begotten
sonne, whom the Angels worship: but the Angels are his
ministring spirits, therfore Chris

stones, doth it therefore follow, y• as manie kinde of stones as
were in his gowne, so manie orders there should be of Angels?Nine orders of Angels.

there compared to Angels, but because the Cherubins y• couered

the mercie seat were of beaten gold, & excellent workmanship,

                  For an Angell went downe at a certeine season into the poole,Iohn. 5. 4.
&c. ¶It is vncerteine when or how often, the Angell came
downe to the water, whether once in a yeare or oftner. Some
thinke that he descended euerie feastiuall daie, & that then some
one sicke person or other was healed. Other-some thinke y• this
was done vpon the daie of Pentecost. Notwithstanding this is
most certeine that the benefit is to bée ascribed vnto God, who
in working hath euer vsed the ministerie of Angels, of men, of
Elements. For that which the Angell did héere, hée did it as a
minister of God. For it is a worke proper vnto God, to cure the
sicke. But as he hath euer vsed the hand and worke of Angels,
so he hath committed these partes in charge to the Angels, for
the which cause the Angels are called powers or vertues,
not because God resigning his power vnto them, sitteth himselfe
idle in heauen: but because he working mightelie in
them, mightelie declareth vnto vs his power. Therefore
they doe verie wickedlie which ascribe anie thing to Angels,
which is proper to God, or which make them such mediatours
betwéene God and vs, that they obscure the glorie of God:
when as we ought rather directlie to come vnto Christ, that
by his conducting aide and commaundement, we maie haue
the Angels helpers and ministers of our saluation.

               ANGER.
               
                  What Anger is, by Aristotles definition.
                  Anger is nothing els (if we maie beléeue Aristotle in
his Rhetorikes) but a desire of reuengement because of contempt.
For they which perceiue themselues to be despised and
contemned, do straight waie thinke, how they maie be reuenged,
and they diligentlie meditate how by some punishment,
they maie requite the iniurie or despite done vnto them.
               
               
                  How Anger (in some respect) is no sinne.
                  
                     
ANger is no sinne, so that the originall thereof, and the ende
whether it extendeth be vertuous, and procéede with charitie.
Moses was angrie and brake the tables of God in his zealous
and godlie passion. He put the idolaters to death, but the ende
was to destroie vice, and mainteine vertue. So was Dauid, so
was Saule, so was Christ, but it sprang of a loue towards God,
and extended to a vertuous ende, the punishment of vice, and
commendation of vertue.

but such as procéedeth of seruent loue, as when the Father
is angrie with the sonne, not bicause he would him euill, but
sheweth thereby that he loueth him better, for in correcting him
he prouideth that he fall not into worse. Such an anger, zeale,
or iealousie, had Phinehes also.

                  What Anger is forbidden.
                  Christ prohibiteth anger as the beginning of hatred, murther,
and destruction. For he said, he that is angrie with his brother
is worthie of iudgement: for anger and reuengement are
seperate one from an other, onelie as the roote and the fruit. For
he that is angrie with anie man, if he hurt him not, that chaunceth,
bicause either he cannot, or els feareth the punishment of
the lawes. He that hateth his brother (saith Iohn) is a murtherer.
But among those which are counted verie angrie, kings aboue
other are numbered, when they perceiue that they are
despised of their subiects. Wherefore Homere saith: Great is
the anger of a kings displeasure.
Pet. Mar. vpon
Iudic. fol. 166.
                  
               
               
                  How anger or wrath is in God.
                  God is said to be angrie (kisse the sonne least the Lord béePsal. 2. 12.
                     
angrie) when we breake his commaundements, despise his
threatnings, set light by his promise, and follow our owne corrupt
appetites. God is said to be angrie and chaunged but the
chaunge is in vs and not in him,Augustine for he is immutable, with
whom saith S. Iames, is no variablenesse, neither is he chaunged.
The Psalmist saith. 101. He chaungeth all things as a vesture,
but he himselfe is immutable, vnchaungeable. Lactantius in the
booke which he writeth of the anger of God, doth not onelie attribute
this vnto God that he séemeth to be angrie, when he doth
chasten and punish sinners: but he doth expreslie giue vnto him
a certeine commotion also which we doe call anger. And I will
not grudge to resite his words. These things saith he, which be
naught must of necessitie displease him that is good and iust, and
he that is displeased with euill, is moued when he seeth it done.
We doe rise to reuenge, not because we be hurt and anoied, but
that discipline maie be kept, mens manners corrected, libertie
refrained. This is a iust anger,Iust anger which as it is necessarie in man
for the redresse of naughtinesse, so is it also in God, from whom
the example came vnto man. For like as it behooueth vs to
chasten them which be subiect vnto our iurisdiction, so it beséemeth
God, to chasten the sinnes of all, and that he maie doe that
he must néedes be angrie. For it is naturall for the good to bee
moued and stirred at the sinne of an other. Therefore they shold
haue defined it thus, that anger is the motion of the mind, meaning
to chastice sinne. For the definition of Cicero: Anger is a
desire to reuenge, is not much different from that we said afore.
But the same anger
                        •
                      which we maie call either furie or rage,Euil anger Good anger.
ought not to be in man, because it is altogether faultie. But
that anger which belongeth to correction of vice, neither ought
to be taken from man, neither can be taken from God, because
it is both profitable & necessarie for mē. This saith Lactantius,
by which words he doth not take from God the commotion and
sturre of anger, but that onelie which is ioined with fault, and
is vnséemelie also for man.
Musculus. fol. 438.
                  
                  For some when they heard,Heb. 3. 16. prouoked him to anger. ¶He is angrie

they would not enter into ye rest promised them, but had
more desire to returne to y• heauie labour & bondage of Aegipt.
                     
This madnesse of y• people the Lord is angrie with, as a louing
Father y• had care ouer them. So if we will haue holie anger,Holie anger. let
it be frée from all hatred & reuenge, & arise onelie for the profit
and well dooing of our neighbour. Thus we read our Sauiour
Christ was angrie, when he sawe y• frowardnesse of the Iewes,
who by no admonitions would be made wiser. Thus S. Paule
prouoketh Timothie, when he saith: Reproue & sharplie rebuke
men, y• they turne not awaie from y• truth. So S. Iude biddeth
vs all if we fall into companie with froward men, to saue them
with feare, as if we would sodeinlie pluck them out of the fire.
Thus if we can haue our affections moued, we are holi

By wrathWrath. is vnderstood, not a disturbance or perturbatiō of the
mind, for these things can haue no place in God. But as Augustin
hath wel interpreted in his booke of y• Trinitie: Wrath in
God signifieth a iust vengeance. And God is said to be angrie,
when he sheweth foorth his effects of an angrie man, which are
to punish & a
                        •
                     enge. So he is said to repent himselfe that he had
made man: because like a man that repenteth himselfe, he would
ouerthrow his worke.

Wheras y• wrath of God wared hot against Israel,
                     Iudic. 2. 14 is not so to
be vnderstood as though God had anie affections, for that perteineth
onelie vnto men. But according to the cōmon & receiued
exposition of these places, we féele y• God is like vnto men
y• are angrie, after which selfe same reson it is written, y• he somtime
repenteth, wherefore God either to repent or to be angrie,
is nothing els, but that he doth those things, which men repenting
or to be angrie vse to doe, for the one do either alter or els
ouerthrowe that which before they had done: and the other take
vengeance or iniuries done vnto them. Ambr

                        se in his booke of
Noe & the Arke, the 4. Chapter, speketh otherwise of the anger
of God: for neither doth God (saith he) thinke as men doe, as
though some contrarie sentence should come vnto him, neither
he is angrie, as though h

hath so much & so farre increased, that euen God also (which naturallie
is hot moued either by anger or hatred, or anie passion)

                  He was excéeding wrath,Mat. 5. 16. &c. ¶There are two kindes of anger,
the one deserued the other vndeserued. The deserued anger
is, with the which God is prouoked against sinners, parents
against disobedient children, Magistrates against wicked
subiects, and maisters against negligent schollers, and
such like. He that giueth occasion of such anger offendeth and
is in fault, bicause the partie against whome the offence is
committed, is iustlie angrie, but such was not the anger of
Herod. The vndeserued anger is, when as they are let by some
meanes or other from their wicked intent and purpose. He that
giueth occasion to these, is not in fault. With this kinde of anger
was Herod angrie, therefore the fault was in himselfe and
not in the wise men.

                  But wheu thou fastest,Mat. 6. 17. anoint thy head, &c. ¶To anoint
the head is meant, as turning the other chéeke, and of that the
left hand should not knowe what the right did. That is, that
they should auoide all vaine glorie, and fast to God, and for
the intent that God ordeined it for. And that with a merie heart
and cheerefull countenaunce, thereby to seeke the working of
God, and to be sure of his fauour. Such is the meaning, and
not to binde them that fast to anoint their heades and wash
their faces. And the manner and phrase of speaking commeth of
an vsage that was among the Iews, to anoint themselues with
swéete and odiferous ointmentes, when they were disposed to
be merie and to make good cheere. As ye sée how Mary of Bethanie
powred a boxe of precious ointments vpon Christs head

               ANTICHRIST.
               
                  What Antichrist is.
                  ANtichrist is not the proper name of a person,1. Iohn. 2. 18. but of an office.
For as S. Iohn in his first Epistle and second Chapter,
saith, manie are Antichrists.
                  ¶Antichrist signifieth not anie perticuler man,1. Iohn. 4. 3 which (as
the people dreame) should come in the end of the world. For yée
sée that in Saint Iohns time he was alreadie come. But all
that teach false doctrine contrarie to the worde of God, are
Antichrists.
Tindale.
                  
                  Marke this aboue all things, that Antichrist is not an outward
thing, that is to saie, a man that should sodeinlie appeare
with wonders, as our Fathers talked of him, no verilie. For
Antichrist is a spirituall thing, & is as much to saie, as against
Christ, that is, one that preacheth false doctrine contrarie to
Christ. Antichrist was in the olde Testament,Antichrist vvas in the olde Testamēt. and fought with
the Prophets. He was also in the time of Christ, and of the Apostles,
as thou readest in the Epistles of Saint Iohn, and of
Paule to the Corinthians and Galathians, and other Epistles.
Antichrist is now, & shall (I doubt not) endure vnto the worlds
ende. But his nature is (when he is vttered and ouercome

with the word of God) to go out of the place for a season, & thē to
come in againe wt a new name, a new raiment. As thou séest
how Christ rebuked y• scribes & the pharesies in y• gospel (which
were verie Antichrists) saieng: Wo be vnto you Pharesies,
for ye rob widdows houses, ye pray lōg praiers vnder a colour,
ye shut vp ye kingdome of heauen, & suffer thē not y• would to
enter in, ye haue taken awaie ye key a knowledge, ye make mē
to breake Gods cōmandements wt your traditions, ye beguile y•
people wt hipocrisie, & such like, which things al our prelats do,
but haue yet got thē new names, & other garments, & are other
wise disguised. Ther is difference is y• names betwéene a Pope,
a Cardinal, a Bishop, & so foorth, & to saie a Scribe, a pharesie, a
Seuiour, & so foorth, but ye thing is al one. Euen so now, whē we
haue vttered him, he will chaunge himselfe once more, & turne
himself into an angel of light. 2. Cor. 11. read y• place I exhort thée,
whatsoeuer thou art that readest this & note it wel. The Iews
looke for Christ, and he is come. 1500. years agoe, & they not aware:
we also haue looked for Antichrist, & he hath reigned as
long, & we not ware, & that because either or vs loked carnallie
for him, & not in y• place where we ought to haue sought.Christ, neither Antichrist, not a right loked for. The
Iewes had found Christ verilie, if they had sought him in y• law
& Prophets, whither Christ sēdeth thē to séeke. Iohn. 5. We also
had spied out Antichrist long ago, if we had looked in y• doctrine
of Christ & his Apostles, where, because ye beast séeth himself now
to be sought for, he roareth & séeketh new holes to hide himselfe
in, & changeth himself into a thousand fashions, with al maner
wilines, falsehood, subtiltie, & craft, because y• his excommunications
are come to light, he maketh it treson vnto the king to be
acquainted with Christ. If Christ & they may not liue together,
one hope we haue y• Christ shal liue for euer. The old Antichrist
brought Christ vnto Pilate, saieng, by our law he ought to die,
and when Pilate had them iudge him after their lawe, they answered:
It is not lawful for vs to kil anie man, which they did
to the intent y• they which regarded not ye shame of their false
excommunications, shold yet feare to confesse Christ, because y•
the temporall sword had condemned him. They do all things of
a good zeale saie they. They loue you so well y• they had rather
burne you then y• you should haue fellowship with Christ. They
are zealous ouer you amisse, as saith S. Paul. Gal. 4. 17. They

would deuide you from Christ & his holie Testament, and ioine
you to the Pope to beléeue his Testament.
Tindale. fol. 60
                  
                  It is to be noted, that as oft as anie mention is made of
Antichrist, it must not be restrained vnto anie one man, but rather
be extended to some whole kingdome, which sets it selfe against
Christs kingdome. For ther haue ben many Antichrists
from the beginning, according as Iohn declareth. 1. Iohn. 2. 18.

                  A prophesie of Antichrists birth.
                  While king Richard was yet in the land of Palestine, he sent to the Ile of
Calabria for Abbas Ioachim, of whose famous learning & wōderfull prophesies
he had heard much. Among other demaunds, he asked him of Antichrist,
what time & in what place he should chieflie appeare. Antichrist
saith he, is alredie borne in the citie of Rome, & will set himselfe yet higher
in y• seat Apostolike. I thought saith y• king, that he shold haue ben borne
in Antioch or in Babilon, & to haue come to the stocke of Dan. I reckoned
also y• he shold haue raigned in the temple of God within Hierusale
                           •
                        , &
onelie haue trauailed, for y• space of three yeares & a halfe wheras Christ
trauailed, to dispute against 
                        
                           •
                        noch & Helias. Not so (saith Ioachim) but
as the Apostle reporteth, he is the onelie aduersarie which extolleth himselfe
aboue al y• is called God. For whereas ye Lord is called but holie, he
is called the most holie father. This Antichrist shalbe opened, & him shall
God destroie with y• spirit of his mouth, & light of his cōming, &c.

                  The time of Antichrists disclosing.
                  If ye will weigh Paules words diligentlie, we shall also know
the time wherin Antichrist must be disclosed to the world. For
writing to y• 
                     Thessalonians y• thought y• Christ should shortlie
come to iudgement,2. Thes. 2. 3 & minding to bring them out of y• opinion,
saith: y• there shall a departing come before the daie of iudgmēt,
y• is to say, y• men must fal from y• Emperour of Rome, as Hierom
Anselme, Theophilact, Bede, Dionise, & almost all y• rest of
y• interpreters take it. True it is y• 
                     Paule spake this thing dark
lie, least he shold offend mens minds. Therfore then (saith Paul)
y• great wicked bodie shall shew foorth himself, yea, & he shal not
onlie succéed, especiallie at Rome in his owne strength, but also
as Daniel writeth he shall bring to naught y• rest of the hornes
& strength of y• empire of Rome. So y• we now sée plainly inough
y• the people hath not onlie shronke from the obedience of the
Empero
                        •
                     r of Rome: but also y• the Emperours haue no dominiō
in Rome, more thē these. 700. years. The Bishops haue occupied
this place in the stead of y• Emperours, by the which Bishops

chieflie. The Emperours power hath béene diminished, wherefore
we must graunt that they bée right Antichrists. B. Ochine.
The Lord shal not come,2. Thes. 2. 3 vnlesse there come first a decaie, & that
the sinfull man be reuealed, the childe of perdition, which shall
bee the aduersarie, & bée aduaunced aboue all that is called God
or godlie, &c. ¶No man doubteth but that he doth speake of Antichrist,
& that hée reporteth y• he shal be reuealed before the comming
of Christ, so that the reuealing or opening of Antichrist,
is the token of these times, which doe goe before the comming
of the Lord. And héere we maie sée what Barnard
                     Barnard. saith vppon
the Psalme. Qui habitat. Sermo. 6. at the end. Now saith hée,
there is peace with pagans, peace with heretikes, but we haue
not peace with false children. Thou hast multiplied people Lord
Iesus, but thou hast not multiplied gladnesse: for there be manie
called and few chosen. All Christian men, and well néere
all doe séeke things of their owne, and not of Iesus Christ. Yea,
the verie offices of ye dignities of the Church, are chaunged into
a filthie gaine, & trafike of darknesse, and there is not sought in
them, the saluation of mens soules, but the wast of riches: for
this they be sworne, for this they doe haunt Churches, saie
Masses, sing Psalmes, they doe striue shamefullie now a daies
for Bishopriks, for Abbotshippes, for Archdeaconries, and other
dignities, so that the rents of the Churches be wasted, in the vse
of superfluitie and vanitie. There remaineth that the man of
sinne, the childe of perdition be reuealed, the diuell not onelie of
the daie, but of the noone daie, which is not onelie transfigured
into an Angell of light, but is aduaunced also ouer all that is
called God, or that is worshipped. This saith Barnard, wherby it
appeareth well inough vnto whō he thought that the words of
the Apostle should be referred, so that no man can charge vs y•
we be the first that haue referred the same vnto the head of the
most corrupt Clergie, I meane ye 
                     Simon of Rome. He gathered by
y• simonie, buieng & selling, couetousnes & excesse of the Churchmen
in his time, that the reuelation of Antichrist was at hand.
Where we must marke by the waie, that Barnard did not onlie
acknowledge the Antichrist should soone be reuealed, but also
that he was in the Church, els he could not haue bene reuealed,
if that his comming had bene yet behinde as it is surmised
in the Poperie.

                  Proues that the Pope is Antichrist, & no heathen Prince.
                  First S. Paule. 2. Thes. 2.
                     1. Reason. speaking purposelie of Antichrist
saith expreslie that he shall sit in the Temple of God, which is
the Church of Christ. And Christ saith. Mat. 24. that they must
come in his name. But it is manifest, that the Heathen Emperours
did not 
                        •
                     it in this Temple of God, therefore Heathen
Emperours be not this Antichrist. And by ye same reason, Mahomet
is not Antichrist, because he sitteth without the Temple
of God. And so Ottomanus. Now the Pope sitteth in the mids
of the Temple of God, and boasteth himselfe to be God, chalenging
vnto himselfe such authoritie as is proper onelie vnto God,
and vsurping such honour as in peculiar vnto God. Therefore
not in the heathen Emperours, but in the Pope, is the Prophecie
accomplished.
                  Againe,2. Reason. it is manifest in scripture, that Antichrist shuld deceiue
the world with false doctrine, vnder pretence and colour of
true religion: and therefore the scriptures so oftentimes warneth
men that they be not seduced by him, which were néedlesse,
if anie open professed enimies of Christ, shuld be that Antichrist.
For there is no likelihood that anie heathen man (a Iewe or a
Turke) should deceiue anie multitude of true Christians, but
he that vnder the pretence of the name of Christ, seeketh most of
all to deface the honour of Christ: he is a subtill aduersarie, &
the verie spirit of Antichrist. As Saint Iohn also, in his Epistle
cap. 2. doth testifie.
                  It is cléere therefore, that Antichrist is no Heathen Emperour,
which was neuer of the Church nor anie false Prophet,
that tooke vpon him to teach in the Church. The same may be
said of Mahomet. But that the Pope is most euidentlie Antichrist,
vpon the words of our Sauiour Christ, when he commaunded
that he which had no sword should sell his coate, and
buy one, signifieng the great daunger that was at hand, Lord
said the Apostles héere are two swords. These words (saith the
Romish gloser) are the Ciuill and Ecclesiasticall power, which
remained in Peter, and therefore his successors the Pope, hath
preheminence of both.

of the Persians, of the Grecians, and of the Romaines. And out
of the fourth Beast (that is to saie, out of the head of y• Monarch
of Rome, sprang a little horne, that is to saie, Antichrist himself)
who hath so aduaunced his might and power, that he hath broken
the power, both of the other hornes, and also the Empire
of Rome, and hath preuailed against the godly. The same thing
Paule the Apostle confirmeth saieng: Before Antichrist be reuealed,
and appeare verie strong, there must be a daparting or
going away, that is to say, the people must fall away from the
obedience of the Emperour. Moreouer Iohn in his Apocalips
setting foorth the Church of Rome vnto vs, to be, not the spouse
of Christ but of Antichrist, saith. That he saw a certeine whore
the mother of all vncleannesse & abhomination of all the world,
holding a golden Cup in her hand, of whose mingled liquor, all
the dwellers of the earth should be made dronke, from the highest
to the lowest. And further, this whore shall be made dronke
with the blood of Saints, and of the Martirs of Christ, and

vpon hir forhead she had written Babilonia. And least any man
should doubt, whether Iohn speake of Rome or not, hée saith
plainlie that the Whore sate vpon seauen hills,7. Hills. which thing is
well knowen to be agréeable vnto Rome, wherevpon it is called
the Citie with seauen hills, wherefore Antichrist seate must
be at Rome, which thing is euident both by holie scripture, and
also by Hierom in an Epistle he wrote to Fabiola against Iouinian,
to Marcello and Aglasia, in the 47. Chapter of his
Commentaries vpon Esay, and in the second Chapter vpon Ose.

                  Of Antichrists progenie.
                  Antichrist was the sonne of a certaine wicked person called
Sinne, hauing to his mother a certaine woman called Perdition,
who caused him to be brought vp of a corrupt nursse called
dame Falsehood the daughter of Satan. The person of this Antichrist,
is not simple, but compounded of two natures, that is
to say diabolicall and humaine, as Iesus Christ is compounded
both of diuine and humaine. And as of God and man is
made one Iesus Christ, so of the Diuell and of the Pope, is
made one Antichrist. And as Iesus Christ is the head of the
beléeuing Church, which is his bodie, so is Antichrist likewise,
the head of the malignaunt Church, which is his bodie,
and doth receiue of him béeing hir head, all manner of corrupt
humours running downe into her. And because he is borne
into the world, onelie to bée contrarie to Iesus Christ,
therefore all his thoughts, all his will, all his workes, all
his doctrine, and briefelie all his life is repugnaunt to IESUS
CHRIST, euen to the drawing of his sword

against him. Albeit he would haue the world beléeue, that hée
doth all this, for the better obseruing of Christian religion.

could the lesse away with, because he taught Christ there, more

faith conteineth, and that is to be coniectured vpon this, that he
calleth him a faithfull witnesse, such a one as Stephen was at

that a humaine bodie and his members, cannot consist without
flesh and bones. Further, their foolishnesse héereby appeareth, because
there is not a bodie found, which is euerie way pure and

hath parts whereof it is composed, and that all composition is against

Angels were true bodies, but they were not borne, such a bodie

saith he, which set forth y• flesh of Christ after the example of the
Angels, saieng that it was not born, namely a fleshly substance,
I would haue them compare the causes also, as well of Christ,
as of the Angels, for which they came into the flesh. No Angel
did at any time therefore descend to be crucified, to suffer death,
and to rise againe from death. If there were neuer anie such
cause why Angels should be incorporate, then hast thou a cause
why they tooke flesh, and yet were not borne. They came not to
die, therefore they cannot be borne. But Christ being sent to
die, it was necessarie that he should be borne, that he might die:
for none is woont to die, but he which is borne, &c.

whom he planted, nor Apollo the roote of them whom he watered,

Apostles had wiues, and wherefore then should it be vnlawfull
for Priests to marrie, they are no better, nor no holier then the
Apostles were. But héere will some say, that the Apostles had
wiues before that Christ did choose them, but afterward they
forsooke their wiues, & followed Christ, which thing is not true,
that they forsooke their wiues, for that had bene plainly against
the doctrine of their master Christ, which taught thē not to forsake
their wiues, but in any wise to kéepe them, sauing onelie
for fornication. And this place of S. Paule: Haue we not power,
&c. doth proue how S. Peter after his Apostleship, and also

when they went a preaching wherefore it is a false lie that they

                     Erasmus in his annotations vpon the fourth Chapter of the

Epistle to the Philipians reporteth the witnesse of Ignatius on
this wise: The holie Martir Ignatius in an Epistle to the Philedelphians doth plainlie graunt, that not onelie Peter but also
Paule and other of the Apostles had wiues. And that they had
them in no lesse reputation therefore, because Patriarchs and
Prophets were married, not for lusts sake, but for childrens
sake. Chrisostome

                      graunteth that there were some which reckoned
that Paule did speake vnto his wife, but dissenteth shewing
no cause of his dissention. But to whom it is more right that
we should sticke to Clement and Ignatius, of which the one was
Saint Peters companion, and the other was Saint Marke the
Euangelists disciple, or shall wée better beléeue Chrisostome,
which was so long a space after the Apostles time. Thus
farre Erasmus.

Prophet and Paule himselfe. The second of God, but by man,
as Iosua was ordeined of God, but by Moses which was a man,
The third sort, are such as by fauour or monie, to get y• roome of

                         Sect. 54. in his Institution saith on this sort, that euerie
Prouince had among their Bishops an Archbishop, and that the
Counsell of Nice did appoint Patriarches, which should be in
order and dignitie aboue Archbishops, it was for the preseruation
of discipline: Therefore for this cause especiallie, were those
degrées appointed, that if anie thing shoulde happen in anie
particular Church, which could not there be decided, it
might bée remooued to a Prouinciall Synode, from whence
there was no Appeale, but vnto a generall Counsell.
                  This kinde of gouernement some called Hierarchiam, an
improper name and not vsed in the Scriptures: For the
spirite of GOD will not haue vs to dreame of Dominion

and rule in gouernment of the Church. But if (omitting the
name) we shall consider the thing it selfe, we shal find that these
olde Bishops did not frame anie other kinde of gouernment in
the Church, from that which the Lord hath prescribed in his
word. ¶Caluine héere mistiketh this name Hierarchia, but

                  In the Ecclesiasticall estate, we take not awaie the distinction
of ordinarie degrées, such as by the Scripture be appointed,
or by the Primatiue Church allowed, as Patriarchs or Archbishops,
Bishops, Ministers and Deacons, for of these foure, we
especiall read as chiefe: In which foure degrées as we graunt
diuersitie of office, so we admit the same also diuersitie of dignitie:
neither denieng that which is due to each degrée, neither
yet mainteining the ambition of any singular person, for as we
giue to the Minister place aboue the Deacon, to the Bishop aboue
the Minister, to the Archbishop aboue the Bishop, so we sée
no cause of inequalitie why one Minister should be aboue another
Minister: one Bishop in his degrée, aboue another Bishop
to deale in his diocesse: or an Archbishop aboue another Archbishop.
And this is to kéepe an order dulie and truelie in the
Church, according to the true nature and definition of order by

to praier, & whereas the power admitted to deliuer the Cup in

that they should execute it with more reuerence, when by such

Graues of lust in Nu. 11. 34. Meriboth, or the waters of strife.

by preuention in this place: which maie be interpreted,
the Armie of wasting or slaughter: representing euen

armie of Antichrist. Hierom (whom Aurigallus followeth in
his Hebrue places) interpreteth Armageddon to be a certaine
Mountaine where the Israelites wer wont to pitch their tents.
Other thinke rather that Armageddon should be called Gospell
hill, or the Hill of glad tidings, or Apple hill, or the Hill of
choice fruits. And trulie the Kings and Princes of the Earth,
haue none other quarrell to fight against the godlie, but
onelie for Christes Gospell, wherevnto all power ought to

the power and might of GOD to saluation. Neither is
there anie cause, but that also by the Arme of GOD,

the Arme doeth all things that hée doeth. So GOD by
his woorde, createth, gouerneth, and iustifieth,

and therefore his word, which is Iesus Christ, is called his
Arme. Neither is this word Arme applied onelie to a man, but

neither the Natiuitie of Christ, nor his Baptime: saieng, he
néeded not to be purged nor clensed of sin. Also they tooke from
all sacraments the vertue to confer grace. They eftsoones baptise
those that came from the Church of the Latines to them,
saieng that we be not of the Catholike faith, but they. They
saie, that no man maie be christened, vnlesse he receiue the
Sacrament of the Altar: & that Infants néed not to be baptised,
affirming that in them is no Originall sinne. That the holie
Ghost procéedeth of the Father, and not of the Sonne. That
the Sacrament of the Altar, maie not be consecrated of bread,
cleane without leauen. Also in the consecration, they put no
water into the wine. Moreouer they saie, that the receiuing
of the Sacrament, profiteth onelie the bodie. That when
Christ descended into Hell, he led with him all that wer there.

That Matrimonie is no Sacrament, and may bée dissolued at
the will of the man or woman. That Christ did rise the
Saterdaie after good Friday. All these and other heresies are
condempned by sundry generall counsailes, and the consent of
all Christendome.

                     ARrius borne in Libia yet a Priest of Alexandria, hearing
Alexander the Bishop intreating curiouslie of y• Trinitie,
thought verilie that he maintained the opinion of Sabellius, set
himselfe against the Bishop, and said, that the sonne of God
had a beginning of essence, that there was a time when he was
not, he said that God was not alwaies a Father, that the sonne
was not from euerlasting, but had his beginning of nothing.
Béeing called before the Emperour, he would subscribe to the
Nicene counsell and sweare to. His deceipt was to carrie in
his bosome, his hereticall opinion written in a péece of paper,
and when he came to the booke, he would sweare y• he thought
as he had written, meaning in his bosome. His end was lamē
                     table,
for comming from the Emperour after the oth he had
taken, with great pompe through the stréet of Constantinople,
he was taken with sodeine feare, & withall he felt a laske, immediatlie
he asked of them where there was anie house of office,
thither he went and voided his guts. As manie as went by
were wont to point at the place with the finger, and saye, in
yonder Iakes died Arrius the heretike.

killed, as it is said Psalme. 38. 2. Some againe expound
them to be the crosse of miserie and wretchednesse, wherein
God had now wrapped him. For the Saints (saie they) receiue
their crosse of the hand of God. The same wil that this sentence
be an increasing and amplifieng of that which his aduersarie
had fierslie laide against him. Eliphas in the beginning of the

had touched him. With this (say they) meteth he now. Beholde,
it not onelie toucheth mée, but woundeth mée with Arrows, and

                  THis saith Dauid Kimhi, was the manner of asking of
God. Hée which would enquire concerning anie publike
affaire, or otherwise of anie weightie matter, came vnto the
Priest, and hée putting on an Ephod, stoode before the Arke of
the Lord. In the Ephod or in the brest plate were. 12. precious
stones, wherein were written the name of the twelue Tribes,
And there were also set the names of Abraham, Isaac, and Iacob.
And in those stones were all the letters of the Alphabet.
The asker ought to turne his face vnto the Priest, and to
aske, not in déede so apertlie that his voice should bée hearde,
neither yet so softlie, that hée should onelie thinke in minde the
things which he
                        •
                      desired, but in such sort as wée reade that
Hanna praied in the first booke of Samuel, where it is sayde,
that shée moued hir lippes onelie, neither spake shée anie thing
that could be heard. Then was the Oracle giuen on this
manner vnto the Priest. By the power of the holie Ghost certeine
letters appeared aboue the other in the brest plate, and
that either in place or in brightnesse, wherein the Priest read
the Oracle and will of God. And these things are those Vrim
and Thumim, which the Priest bare in his breast lappe. This
is Kimhies opinion, vnto whom, what faith is to be giuen I
cannot tell, for it might be that the spirit of God, did without
letters giue Oracles, by the voice of the high Priest, whose
heart he inspired with prophesie, &c.

second sonne of Sem, which Assur (as Lyra saith) would
not rebell against God, with Nemroth in the building of the
towre of Babilon, but fled out of the land of Senhar into a nother
farre countrie, where he first inhabited, by reason wherof
the countrie tooke his name, and was called Assiria. In the
which countrie he builded a citie, that in processe was called
Niniue, which citie was so great, that it was thrée daies iourney
to goe through it.

sword.Isay. 31. 8 ¶The Prophet should héere séeme to prophesie of the

And Esaie. 37. 36. which was done by the sword of the Angell,
not by the sword of man, as ye maie there sée. Sennacherib was
the king of Assiria, and therefore is the destruction of the Assirians

moueth the people to forsake Idols) expound it thus: not by
our Idols, not by our strength, not by mannes helpe (which all
maie be called the sword of man) shall our spirituall enimie
(which is signified by Assur) perish: but by the power of God,

and the inuisible sword that cannot bée séene, with which the
Angell slewe, an hundred, foure score and fiue thousand in one

worshipped in the forme of a Shéepe. For a shéepe in Hebrue
is called Aschtor. And as it appeareth by the fourth booke

               ASTROLOGIE.
               
                  What Astrologie is.
                  AStrologie is the knowledge of the naturall order and disposition
that God hath set in the starres and planets, to iudge
of the office, propertie, and vertue, and to bring all to their end
and vse.
Caluine.
                  
                  The Astrologer is he that knoweth the course and motions
of the heauens, and teacheth the same which is a vertue, if it
passe not his bondes, and he become of an Astrologer an Astronomer.
Who taketh vpon him to giue iudgement and censure
of those motions and course of the heauens, what they prognosticate
and destinie vnto the creatures of the earth, man, beast
and other, what shall be the temperature of the aire, the condition
of the earth, the state & successe of such fruite as it bringeth
foorth. By this knowledge they forespeake of pestilence,
and other discases, and séeth the death of great men to come, &
such commotions and warres as shall followe betwéene the
Princes of the world. And thus they saie they knowe, by the
course of the heauens. Whereas they sée the coniunctions of
manie planets, of figures, and fatall disposition and qualitie,
concurre: by reason of whose influence into these inferiour
partes, all those calamities must happen. Heere they abuse not
onelie the name of God, and the naturall discourse of reason
which hath comprehended the motions and course of heauens,
but also heauen it selfe, and attribute vnto the heauens, the
thing that onelie apperteineth to God: To saie the health of

man, the sickenesse of man, the plentie of the earth, and scarcitie
of the same, the regument of common, and the life & death
of gouernours thereof. Their knowledge and practise in those
things is nothing at all. For almightie God hath not made the
heauens to that end and purpose, that man shold learne of them
good fortune or ill, as it is plaine. Gen. 1. In the second daie,
God made the Firmament and superiour Starres, which the
text calleth Rakiah, to this end that it should seperate the waters
that be vnder the Firmament, from those that be aboue
the Firmament, and God called the Firmament heauen. In
the fourth daye GOD made the Sunne, the Moone, and the
Star
                        •
                     es. And sheweth to what purpose and ende he made
them, the one to haue dominion in the daie, the other in the
night, and God put them in the Firmament of heauen, to
giue light vnto the earth. These rule in the daie and night,
and put difference betwéene light and darknesse, to diuide
the yeare into his portes, the Spring, Sommer, Autume,
and Winter. They are in signes likewise saith the Text.
The which the Husbandman that tilleth and soweth the
ground, obserueth without superstition, to sowe and reape
his corne. Hée casteth it into the ground in the Winter, and
receiueth it againe in the Summer. So doth the Marriner
make the reuolution of the Moone, his decrease and increase,
whereby he knoweth the tides, the ebbes and flowe of the
same. And the latter Phisitions, Auicene, and Auerrois hath
likewise assigned their vse in mans bodie, therefore they appoint
diuersitie of daies in the practise of Phisicke, one to
bée more apt for letting of bloude then other, to purge
and to bane then the other. If they maie be obserued without
superstition, it maie be suffered. So that notwithstanding that
such as obserue not these latter rules, may both minister and
receiue medicines, for the heauens were made to serue vs, and
not to master vs, were created for man, and not man for them.
Therefore it is a false superstition to saie, good or bad, plentie,
or scarcitie, sicknesse or health, warre or peace, dependeth of the
influence of the heauens, &c,

maie knowe what the Lord of hoasts hath determined against
Aegipt. And yet there was no part of Astrologie but it was
there. The Prophet doth as it were speake in despite against
all them that meddle with it, saieng that it is not their office,
to knowe the things which come to passe as they make profession.

were anie: so that all they which haue thrust themselues into
this curiositie, did borrowe their name from them. Wherefore
we sée how God reproueth and condemneth them: and pronounceth
plainlie, that men cannot learne of the starre, the
mutation and falls of kingdomes. And that he will punish the
pride of them, which haue thrust themselues in, to enterprise
it, &c.

which haue no power of themselues, but are gouerned by him,
and their secrete motions and influences are not knowne to
man, and therefore there can be no certeine iudgement thereof.

are verie good. But to coulour witchraft, sorcerie, and familiaritie
with the diuell, with the name and coulour of Astronomie
as some doe, is a diuellish and a damnable practise, condemned
by the word of God in a thousand places, would haue

did deuine and shew before what should after happen to the

making.
                  IN English thus: Haile Marie full of grace, the Lord is
with thée: blessed art thou among women, and blessed is
the fruite of thy wombe Iesus Christ: and blessed is Anna
thy mother, of whom thy virgins flesh, hath procéeded without

blot of original sinne. ¶Héere is thrée things to be noted: First,
how the Pope turneth vnproperlie into a praier, which properlie
was sent of God for a message or tidings. Secondly, how
the Pope addeth to the words of Scripture, contrarie to the
expresse precept of the Lord. Thirdly, how the Pope exempteth
Marie the blessed Uirgin, not onelie from the séede of Abraham,
and Adam, but also from the condition of a mortall creature.
For if there be in hir no originall sinne, then she beareth
not the Image of Adam, neither doth she descend of that séede,
of whose seede euill procéedeth vpon all men & women to condemnation,
as Paule doth teach. Rom. 5. 12. wherfore if shée descended
of that séede, then the infection of originall euill, must
necessarilie procéede vnto hir. If she descended not therof, then
shée commeth not of the séede of Abraham, nor of the séede of
Dauid, &c. Againe, séeing that death is the effect and stipend of
sinne, by the doctrine of Saint Paule, Rom. 6. 23. Then had hir
flesh iniurie by the lawe (as Christ himselfe had) to suffer the
malediction and punishment of death, and so should neuer haue
died, if originall sinne had no place in hir, &c.

haue it brought to himselfe, or his assignes, to bee iudged & correct:

that a man should be a righteous and equall, or an indifferent
iudge in his owne cause, lustes and appetites, so blinde is
our affections in vs. Moreouer, when thou auengest thy selfe,
thou makest not peace, but stirreth vp more debate. God
therefore hath giuen lawes vnto all Nations, and in all landes
hath héeput lungs and gouernours, and rulers in his owne

they were not troubled with. By reason of which faith, they
counted him for their God, and worshipped his outwarde

                  In the land of Sennaar, that is in the land of the Chaldes,
in a great plaine was Babilon builded in processe of time,
mightelie & stronglie augmented with rich pallaices, pleasant
houses, strong walles and towres, called the head Citie and
Empire of all the world, so celebrated, and standing inuict,
with manie glorious victories, by the space of. 1495. yeares,
hauing the whole world vnder their dominion. It was builded
foure in square, thrée thousand paces ouer from wal to wal.
The wall was. 200. foote high, and. 500. foote broade. And yet
was euerie foote longer by thrée fingers then ours. It was
in circuite without the outward walls. 480. furlonges. It
was double walled with manie high and strong towres, and
by a meruailous craft and labour, the floud Euphrates was
brought to runne rounde about it, betwixt and without the

walls, and through manie places of the citie. It is so described
of the auncient historie writers, as of Ioseph, Plinie, Herodoto,
Orosio, as no Citie else to bée like it. But this so mightie
a Citie and golden head, when the king Balthazar with
his nobles were feasting and banketting in the night in most
securitie, for that they thought their Citie to bée inexpugnable.
Then came king Cyrus and laide siege to Babilon. Hée digged vp the bankes of Euphrates, and turned the floud
cleane from the Citie, so that without perill hée might with
his hoast enter in, and then hauing the king of Babilon in such
drunkennesse and securitie, he slewe him and tooke the citie.
In that Citie yet (as it is left) there remaineth the Temple
of Iupiters Image called Bele, the finder of the Syderall science,
or els is there none other memoriall or scant anie vestigie
thereof.

how that the same must quench and drowne the lusts of the
flesh to followe the steps of Christ.

                  How we be washed by baptime.
                  Whereas Saint Paule saith we be washed by Baptime,
his meaning is, that GOD doth thereby both witnesse
our washing, and therewithall perfourme the thing
that is figured. For except the truth or performaunce

of the thing, went ioyntlie with the signe of it, it were an vnproper
speach to say, that Baptime is the washing of the soule.
And by the waie, we must beware that we put not ouer that
thing, either to the signe, or to the minister of the signe, which
is proper to God onelie, that is to saie, that we thinke not the
minister to be the author of washing vs cleane, or the water
to purge the filthinesse of our soule. Which to doe belongeth
onelie vnto Christs bloud. Againe, we must take héede that
no peece of our trust do stick either to the water or to the man,
for as much as the onelie right vse of the Sacrament is, to
leade vs straightlie by the hande vnto Christ, and there to
staie. For it is onelie the holie Ghost that renueth and quickeneth
vs, and no creature or outward worke is able to bring
that to passe. For if circumcision doe nothing auaile in Christ,
Gal. 5. 6. Surelie neither auaileth it anie man, to bée but
onelie dipt in water, and to be admitted into the Church, except
he haue faith, that is workefull by charitie, which thing
the powring on of water perfourmeth not, for then should all
that bée baptised be faithfull: And therefore there is added,
Through the word.

                  To baptise in the name of Christ, is to baptise according to
the institution and commaundement of Christ, neither do these
words in the name of Christ, import that Baptime was ministred
in the name of Christ onelie, and in none other name beside,
no more then these wordes, Paule the Seruaunt of Iesus
Christ, doe import, that Paule was the seruant of Iesus Christ
onelie, and so not the seruant of God the Father, nor of the Holie
Ghost. Or these wordes that Paule spake vnto the Kéeper,
Beléeue in the Lord Iesu, doe discharge him from beleeuing
in the other two persons of the holie Trinitie.
               
               
                  Of the Baptime of Infants.
                  Note héere, that the Fathers made a league with God, not
onelie for themselues, but also for their posteritie, as God againe
for his part promised them, that he would be the God, not
onelie of them, but also of their séede and post eritie, wherefore
it was lawfull for them to circumcise their children, béeing yet
Infants. And in like manner it is lawfull for vs to baptise
our little ones being yet Infants, forasmuch also, as they are
comprehended in the league. For they which haue now the
thing it selfe, there is nothing that can let, but that they maie
receiue the signe. It is manifestlie written in the. 29.
                     Deu. 29. 13. Chapter of
Deu. That the league was made not onelie with them which
was present, but also with them which was absent and not
yet borne.

                  Concerning young children, because their faith is vnknowen
to vs, it is requisite that they be partakers of y• fruites
of the sacraments, and it is not verie likelie that they haue faith
because they haue not the vse of vnderstanding, except God doe
worke in them extraordinarilie, the which appeareth not to vs
                        •
                     
neuerthelesse we cease not to communicate to them Baptime.
First, forasmuch as there is now the same cause in Baptime
which was sometime in Circumcision, which is called by Saint
Paule, the seale of righteousnesse,Rom. 4. 1
                           •
                        
                      which is by faith,Ge. 17. 17. and also by
expresse commaundement of God the male children were marked
the eight daie. Secondlie there is a speciall regard to be had

to the Infants of the faithfull, For, although they haue not faith
in effect, such as those haue that be of age, yet so it is that they
haue the séede and the spring, in vertue of the promise, which
was receiued and apprehended by the Elders. For God promiseth
not vs onelie to be our God,Ge. 17. 7. if we beleeue in him: but also
that he will be the God of our ofspring and séed, yea vnto a thousand
degrees, that is to the last end. Therfore said Saint Paule
that the children of the faithful be sanctified from their mothers
wombe. By what right or title then doe they refuse to giue
them the marke & ratification of that thing which they haue &
possesse alreadie. And if they alleadge yet further, that although
they come of faithful Elders or parents, it followeth not y• they
be of ye number of the elect, & by consequent, & they be sanctified,
(For God hath not chosen all the children of Abraham and Isaac.Rom. 9. 7.)
The aunswere is easie to be made, that it is true all those
be not of the kingdome of God, which be borne of faithfull
parents, but of good right we leaue this secret to GOD for to
iudge, which onelie knoweth it, yet, notwithstanding wée presume

                        ••
                     stlie to be the children of God, all those which be issued
& descended from faithfull parents according to the promise. Forasmuch
as it appeareth not to vs the contrarie. According to the
same we baptise the young children of the faithful, as they haue
vsed and done from the Apostles time in the Church of God, &
we doubt not but God by this marke (ioined with the praiers
of the church which is their assistaunt) doth seale the adoption &
election in those which he hath predestmate eternallie, whether
they die before they come to age of discretion, or whether they
liue to bring foorth the fruites of their faith in due time, and according
to the meanes which God hath ordeined.

where the Eunuche was not permitted to be baptised, before
confession made of his faith. ¶The aunswere is made thus,
that that was done to the Eunuche, must not be drawen to the
Infants of Christians, rashlie to kéepe them from Baptime,

that are of full age, For we affirme that such as are strangers
from the Church of Christ, (as sometimes were the Iewes and
Gentiles, and as are at this daie the Iewes and Turkes, and

other such like) ought not to be baptised vntill they haue made
profession of their faith. But the reason of Infants borne of
Christians, is of a farre other sort and case, for they are accounted
among the children and household of the Church, by reason
of the lawe of Couenaunt. They be holie, and Christ commaundeth
them to be brought vnto him. It is manifest they
please God, because their Angels alwaies, sée the face of the father.
And although our capacitie cannot conceiue their state
and condition, yet Christ testifieth they haue faith, and that they
haue the Holie Ghost, the examples of Iohn Baptist and
others teach vs.

words ouer the water, and there be no child to be baptised, these
words onelie pronounced doe not make Baptime. And againe,
Baptime is onelie Baptime to such as be baptised, and not to
anie other standing by. As Baptime is no Baptime, but to
the childe that is baptised, and not to the standers by: so the
Sacrament of the bodie, is no Sacrament, but to them that
worthelie receiue. Whereas Saint Austen saith, that Infants
are baptised In Fide Susceptorum, in the faith of their
Godfathers, yet in so saieng, hée meaneth of the faith of
Christ, which the Godfathers doe, or ought to beléeue, and none
otherwise.

God, and that this attonement is made by the bloud, death, and
resurrection of Christ, and to put vs in minde of the mortifieng
of the flesh, of the quickening of the spirit, and continuall repentaunce,
& of the glorifieng that shall be héereafter by Christ.

is the gift and worke of the whole Trinitie, in whose name we
are baptised, to the intent we should sticke therevnto, and worship
it all our life long.

                  How baptime purifieth and cleanseth.
                  Baptime hath also his word and promise, which the Priest
ought to teach the people, and christen them in the English
tongue, and not to plaie the Popengaie, with Credo saie yee,
Volo saie ye Baptismum saie ye, for there ought to be no mumming
in such matter. The Priest before he baptiseth, asketh,
saieng: Beleeuest thou in God the Father Almightie, and in
his sonne Iesus Christ, and in the Holie Ghost, and that the
Congregation of Christ is holie, and they saie, yea. Then the
Priest vpon this faith baptiseth the childe, in the name of the
Father & of the Sonne and of the holy Ghost, for the forgiuenes
of sinnes, as Peter saith. Act. 2. The washing without the word
helpeth not, but through the word it purifieth and cleanseth vs.
As thou readest. Ephe. 5. 26. Now Christ cleanseth the Congregation
in the Fountaine of water through the Word. The
Word is the promise that God hath made. Now as Preachers
in preaching the word of God saueth the hearers that beléeue,Word.
so doth the washing in that it preacheth and representeth vnto
vs, the promise that God hath made vnto vs in Christ.

olde life of sinne, which is Adam. And the pulling out againe,

                  As touching the dipping downe of the childe that is to be

that the Church is at libertie to baptise, either by dipping in,
or els by sprinkling. We maie sée in Augustine, that this libertie
was 
                        •
                     ept in the Churches: He that is

                     . And after his aunswering he is
either sprinkled with water or dipped into it. And Cipriane
doth vphold the vse of sprinkling in Baptime, but yet so, that
he saith it is at mens libertie.

                  The Sacrament of Baptime (saith the Master of the Sentences)
doth consist in two things, that is to saie, in the Word,
and in the Element, so that although that the other things
bée awaie, which were instituted for the better beautifieng of
the Sacrament,Word & Element. in case that the Word be there and the Element.
For both in this, and in other Sacraments also,

there are accustomed to be done some things to the beautie,
comelinesse, and some things which belong to the substance and
cause of the Sacrament. The Word and the Element be of
the substaunce of the Sacrament, the rest is applied to the solemnitie
of it. Thus saith he. Of which (saith Musculus) I
like well, that he doth acknowledge that the wholenesse and substaunce
of Baptime doth consist in two things, that is to wit,
the Word and the Element. And that the Sacrament is true
and holie, if it haue these two things, though the rest be awaie.
But wheras he doth referre the rest, vnto beautie, comelinesse,
and solemnitie, what followeth thereof els, but that Iohn and
the Apostles did baptise neither beautifullie, nor comelie, nor
Colemnlie: for as much as they vsed none of these things.

dost thou sowe (saith hée) that which is not lawfull for thée to

infamie will thereby come, both to him which shall be borne, &
to thée also. For he as long as he liueth shal be full of ignomie,

that Bastards should not be admitted to the inheritance of their

had diuerse of his friends resorting vnto him, into the guilde
hall, where he was kept. Among whom one of the said friends
finding him eating of an Albrew, with such a chéereful heart
and quiet minde as he did, said that he was glad to sée him at
that time so shortlie before his heauie & painfull departure, so
heartelie refresh himselfe: Oh said he, I followe the example
of the husbandman of the countrie, who hauing a ruinous

house to dwell in, will yet bestow cost as long as they maie
hold it vp, & so doe I now with this ruinous house of my bodie,
and with Gods creatures in thankes to him, refresh the
same as ye sée. Then sitting with his said friendes in godlie
talke to their edification, some put him in mind, that though
the fire which he should suffer the next daie, should be of great
heate vnto his bodie, yet the comfort of Gods spirite shoulde
coole it to his euerlasting refection. At that word the said Thomas
Bilney putting his hand toward the flame of the candle
burning before them (as also he did diuers times beside) & séeling
the heate thereof, O sayd he, I féele by experience, & haue
known it long by philosophie, the fire by Gods ordinance is
made naturally hot. But yet I am perswaded by Gods holie
word, and by the experience of some, spoken of in the same,
that in the flame they felt no heate, and in the fire they felt no
consumption. And I constantlie beléeue, that howsoeuer the
stubble of this my bodie shall be wasted by it, yet my soule &
spirit shall be purged thereby: A paine for a time, whereon
nowithstanding followeth ioie vnspeakable. And he much intreated

one of Israel. Which he did most comfortablie intreat off,
as well in respect of himselfe, as appling it to the perticular
vse of his friendes there present. Of whom some tooke such
swéet fruit therein, that they caused the whole sayd sentence to
be faire written in tables, and some in their bookes, the comfort
whereof (in diuerse of them) was neuer taken from them

séer. Which when he desireth to féede Christs flocke with the
foode of health, that is with his holie word, as the Bishops did
in Paules time, desireth a good work, and the verie office of a
Bishop. But he that desireth honour, gapeth for lucre, thirsteth
great rentes, séeketh preheminence, pompe, dominion, coueteth
abundance of al things without want, rest and hearts
ease, castles, parkes, Lordships, Earledomes, &c. desireth not a
worke, much lesse a good worke, and is nothing lesse then a
Bishop, as Saint Paule héere vnderstandeth a Bishop.

                  How Bishops were chosen.
                  In choosing of Bishops, the people had their libertie long
preserued, that none should be thrust in, that were not accepted
of all. This therfore was forbidden in the counsell at Antioch,
that none should be thrust in to them against their wil,
Which thing also Leo ye
                      first doth diligentlie confirme. Héerevpon
came these saiengs: Let him be chosen whom the Clergie
and the people, or ye greater number shal require. Againe,
let him that shall beare the rule ouer all be chosen of all. For
it must needs be, ye he that is made a ruler being vnknowne
and not examined, is thrust in by violence. Againe, let him be
chosen by the Clarks, and desired by the people: and let him
be consecrate by them of that prouince with the iudgemēt of
the Metropolitane. The holy Fathers tooke so great héed: that
the libertie of the people should by no meanes be diminished,
that when the generall Synode gathered together at Constantinople
did ordeine Nectarius, they would not doe it without
the allowance of the whole Clergy and people: As they
testified by thrée Epistles to the Synode at Rome. Therfore
when anie Bishop did appoint a successor to himselfe
                        •
                      it was
none otherwise stablished, vnlesse y• whole people did confirme
it. Whereof you haue not onely an example, but also y• verie
forme in Augustine in ye naming of Gradius. And Theodor
                           •
                        te
when he reheraseth that Peter was named by Athanasius to
bée his successor, by & by addeth y• the elders of Priests confirmed
it, & the magistrate & nobility & the people approued it

with their allowing shoute.

                  Of the ordination of Bishops and Ministers.
                  The ordination of Bishops hath nothing proper or peculiar,
besides fruits & commodities that necessarilie depend therof,
for it is the decrée of the Lord, that of them to whome they
minister the secrets and mysteries of the heauenlie life, they
receiue the things that belong to the necessarie vses and maintenaunce
of this lyfe. As Saint Paule plainlie proueth to the
Corinthians. 1. Chapter. 9. from the. 4. verse to the. 15. And the
1. to Timothie. 5. 17. & 18. And to the Gal. 6. 6. which thing also
Christ teacheth. Mat. 10. 10. Luke. 10. 17. So ye this is the iust &
right lawe of God, that the Bishoppes or ministers are to bée
mainteined of the Churches: and such a measure is to be kept,
ye they be neither pressed with ouer great néed, nor runne riot
with too much excesse, for in either of them a regard is to bée
had to the calling of a Bishop, whom Saint Paule willeth to
be both watching and sober, and also modest & herberous, & in
1. Cor. 9. proueth that it is lawfull for him not onelie to eate &
drinke at the Corinthians, costs and charges, as in the. 4. verse.
But also to enterteine a wife, as in the. 5. verse, and generelly
to liue well and honestlie as in the. 14. verse.
               
               
                  Of vnpreaching Bishops and Pastors.
                  The world (saith Gregory) is full of Priests,Gregorie. but yet in the
haruest, there are seldome workemen found: because indéed we
take vpon vs the office of Priests, but we fulfill not the work
of the office. Againe, because they haue not the bowels of charitie
they will séeme Lordes. They acknowledge not themselues
to be Fathers. They chaunge the place of humilitie
into the aduauncing of lordlinesse. Againe: But what
do we, O Pastors, we receiue the reward and are not workmen?
We are fallen to outward businesse, and we take in
hand one thing and performe an other: we leaue the ministrie
of preaching: and to our punishment as I sée, we are called
Bishops, and keepe the name of honour, but not of vertue.

is

                      in the Scripture. It was not
so at the beginning when Bishoppes were at the best. As the
Epistle of Paule to Tit. testifieth, that willed him to ordeine in
euerie Citie of Crete a Bishoppe. And in case there were such
loue in them now as was then toward the people, they would
saie themselues there were more to doe for the best of them in
one Citie, then he could doe. They knowe that the primatiue
Church had no such Bishoppes as be nowe a daies, as examples
testifie, vntill the time of Syluester the first, a little and a
little riches crept so into the church, that men sought more hir,
then the wealth of people, and so increased within few yeares,
that Bishoppes became Princes, and Princes were made
seruauntes. So that they haue set them vp with their almes
and liberalitie in so high honour, that they cannot plucke them
downe againe with all the force they haue.

                  What regard Bishops ought to haue in feeding the poore.
                  Manie godlie Bishops and ministers after the Apostles were
so studious for the poore,Read Palinus Bishop of Nola. that they spent not onelie vppon them
the goods of the church, but also their owne patrimonie, & when
that would not serue, they laboured with their owne handes,
that by this meanes they might supplie that which lacked, according
to the example of Saint Paule.
                  
                  They hired not men to kéepe the poore out of their gates, but
appointed men to stand before their gates, after the example of
Abraham and Lot, to call the poore into their houses.
                  The glorie of a Bishop (saith S. Hierome) is to prouide for
the poore,Hierome. but the ignominie of all Priestes, to looke for their
owne ease and profit.

that if they be found to be no mainteiners thereof, they
maie lawfullie be deposed Againe, a Bishop to the vttermost
of his power ought to minister vnto the poore, and to the sicke,
which through weaknesse are not able to labour with their

                     ¶Bishops build houses in bignesse not vnlike to Churches.Hugo de Clastio. li. 1. cap. 1.
They haue a great delight to haue their chambers painted and
set out with most goodlie and precious colours, and hanged with
rich and costlie clothes: but the poore man goeth naked. I may
trulie saie, the poore are manie times spoiled and robbed, that
stones and stockes may be garnished. They garnish their halls,
with great and mightie pillers: They set lodges before their
dores, but would God they were made to receiue, and not to deceiue
the poore.
                  ¶S. HieromHierom. saith, Let other build Churches, hang walles,
make great pillers, and gylde the tops of them, & decke Altars
with golde and precious stones. But be thou of another minde,
I meane to cloath Christ in the poore, to feede him in the hungrie,
to visite him in the sicke, to receiue in, them that want
lodging, speciallie in them that are of the householde of faith.

and yet no more vaine then mad. The Church shineth
in the walles, and lacketh in the poore. It garnisheth hir stones
with golde, and leaueth hir children naked. That which should
be spent vpon the poore, is bestowed to please the eies of the rich.

Apostles successours, and he thinketh not anie Bishop to bee
lesse then other, for that he is poorer, or greater then other, for
that he is richer. For he maketh the Bishop of Eugubium, (a
poore towne) equall with the Bishop of Rome. And farther, hée
thinketh that a Bishop is no better then a Priest, sauing that
the Bishop hath authoritie to order Ministers.

prophane writers vse generallie for euerie kinde of reproch,
the Scripture referreth vnto God, when his maiestie and his
glorie is defaced. And there are two sortes of blasphemie, as
either when God is robbed of his proper honour (as if so bée a
man should arrogate y• vnto himselfe which is proper to God)
or els when anie thing is attributed and giuen to him, which
his nature will not beare. Therfore they call Christ a sacrilegious
& blasphemous person, because hée béeing a mortal man,
vsurped to himselfe diuine honour. And this was a true definition
of blasphemie, if so bée Christ had bene nothing more then
a man. Onelie they sinne in this, that they refuse to beholde

&c. Of this place the Scribes & Pharises argued that Christ
was a blasphemer, because he tooke vpon him to forgiue sins:

Cal. in the. 5. Psal. verse. 12

                  Gods blessings are his giftes: as in the first Chapter of Genesis:
he blessed them, saieng, Grow and multiplie & haue dominion.
And in the. 9. Chapter, he blessed. Noe & his sonnes, and
gaue dominion ouer all beasts, & authoritie to eate them. And
God blessed Abraham, with cattel and other riches. And Iacob
desired Esau to receiue the blessing which he brought him, that
is the present and gift. God blessed the. 7. daie. That is, gaue it
a preheminence that men should rest therein from bodilie labour,
and learne to know the wil of God and his lawes, & how
to worke their works godlie all the wéeke after. God also blessed
all nations in Abrahams séed, that is, he turned his loue and
fauour vnto them, & giueth them his spirit, and knowledge of
the true waie, and lust and power to walke therein, and all
for Christs sake Abrahams sonne.

                  Blessed be the name of the Lord.Iob. 1. 21. ¶We maie not onelie
picke out the words, but also consider of what minde they procéede,
and that they be spoken trulie and vnfainedlie, for how is
it possible that we should blesse the name of God, if we doe not
first acknowledge him to be righteous? But he that grudgeth
against God, as though he were cruell and vnkinde, cursseth
God, because that as much as in him lieth, he lifteth himselfe
vp against him. He that acknowledgeth not God to be his father,
and himselfe to be Gods childe, ne yéeldeth record of his
goodnesse, blesseth not God. And why so? For they which taste
not of the mercie and grace that God sheweth vnto men, when
he afflicteth them, must néedes grinde their téeth at him, and cast
vp, and vomit out some poyson against him. Therefore to blesse
the Lords name importeth as much as to perswade our selues,
that he is iust and righteous of his owne nature: and not onelie
that, but also that he is good and merciful. Lo
                        •
                      héere how we
maie blesse Gods name after the example of Iob, that is by acknowledging
his Iustice and vprightnesse, and moreouer also,
his grace and fatherlie goodnesse towards vs, &c.

                  The cause why God is said to blinde men, is for that when
he hath bereft them of right vnderstanding of minde, and of the
light of his holie spirit, he giueth them vp to the Diuell, to be caried
awaie, into a wilfull wicked minde. Rom. 1. 28. and sendeth

after the same manner that the Authour of the Epistle
to the Romanes saith: If the bloud of Bulls and Goates, and
the ashes of a Bullocke besprinkling them that are defiled,
doe hallowe them as touching the cleansing of the flesh: how
much more shall the bloud of Christ (who by the euerlasting
spirite hath offered himselfe vnspotted vnto GOD) cleanse
your consciences from deade workes,Heb. 9. 13. to serue the liuing

                  How the verie flesh and bloud of Christ
is not in the Sacrament.
                  It was not lawfull by Moses lawe,Deu. 12. 23 to eate nor drinke the
bloud,Bloud forbidden. neither of man nor of beast. And the Apostles themselues,
somewhat fauouring the infirmitie of the Iewes, did institute
that men should abstaine from bloud. Now if the Apostles had
taught that in the sacrament the very flesh and bloud of Christ
is eaten and dronken with the téeth and mouth, it had bene a
great occasion to haue excluded al y• Iewes at once from Christ:
againe the Apostles would haue bene too scrupulous (if they had
so groselie vnderstood it) to haue dronken the very bloud, séeing
it was so plaine against Moses Lawe. Reade the 10. of
the Actes, where as Peter had the cloath sent downe.

                  Bloud is the souleDeu. 12. 23 ¶S. Augustine vppon these wordes

Christ. And in the same Chapter, he ioineth these thrée sentences

and This is my Bodie, as being all both of like meaning, and
also of like manner of vtteraunce.
                  ¶Saint Ambrose expounding the same words saith thus:
When Moses in that place called the Bloud the Soule: doubtlesse
he meant thereby, that the Bloud is one thing
                        •
                      and the
Soule another.
                  
                     For this is my bloud in the new Testament. ¶The wine

                     Dardamus did write vnto Saint Austen for the exposition of
these words,Augu. ad Dardamus that Christ spake vnto the Thiefe saieng: This
daie shalt thou be with me in Paradise: and wist not how to
vnderstand it, whether Christ meant, that the Thiefe should be
in Paradise with Christs soule, or with his bodie, or with his
Godhead. Therevpon Saint Austen writeth, that as touching
Christs bodie that daie it was in the Sepulcher, & saith it was
not in Paradise, although it was in a garden that he was buried,
for Christ (he saith) meant of a place of ioie, and that was
not (saith S. Augustine) in his Sepulcher. And as for Christs
soule it was that daie in hell, and no man will saie that Paradise
is there, wherefore (saith S. Austen) the text must néedes be
vnderstood that Christ spake it of his Godhead. ¶Héere S.
Austen saith plainlie, that Christs bodie as touching his manhood
was in the graue: and as touching his Soule it was in

Hell: so that while his bodie was in the graue, it was not in
Paradise. For if he had thought that Christs bodie or soule
might haue bene in diuers places at once, he would not haue
said that the text must néedes be vnderstood of his Diuinitie.
                  Againe. As touching his Manhoode he was in Earth, and
not in Heauen (where he now is) when he said, No man ascendeth
into Heauen, but he that descended from Heauen, the
Sonne of man which is in Heauen.
                  ¶Doubt not (saith Austen againe) but that Christ our
Lord, the onelie begotten sonne of God, equall with the Father
and the same being the sonne of man, wherein the Father is
greater, is whole present in all places as touching his Godhead,
and dwelleth in the same Temple of God as God, and in some
place of heauen, for the cordicion of his verie bodie. Héere S.
Austen saith as touching his Manhood, he is onelie in one certaine
place in heauen, and not in manie places at once.
                  ¶The same one man is locall (that is to saie contained in
one place) as touching his manhood,Fulgen. ad Transmun. reg. li. 2. which is also God vnmeasurable
from the father. The same one man as touching the substaunce
of his manhood, was absent from heauen when he was
in earth, and so forsaking the earth, when he ascended into Heauen:
but as touching his Godhead & vnmeasurable substance,
he neither forsooke heauen, when he descended from heauen, nor
forsooke the earth, when he ascended into heauen, which maie be
knowen by the most sure word of the Lord, which to shew his
humanitie to be locall (that is to say conteined in one place onelie)
did say vnto his Disciples: I ascend vnto my father & your
father, my God, and your God. Of Lazarus also when he said:
I am glad for your sakes (that you may beléeue) for that I was
not there. And againe, shewing the vnmeasurablenesse of his
Godhead, & said vnto his Disciples: I am with you vnto the
worlds ende. How did he ascend into heauen but because hée is
locall and a verie man, or how is he present vnto his faithfull,
but because he is vnmeasurable and verie God.
                  ¶Now may Christ be called a straunger,Origen in Ma. ho. 33 is he departed into
a strange countrey, séeing he is with vs vnto the worlds end,
and is among them, that be gathered in his name? Aunswere.
Christ is both God and man, hauing in him two natures. And
as man he is not with vs vnto the worlds ende, nor is present

with his faithfull gathered together in his name. But his diuine
power & spirit is euer with vs. Paule (saith he) was absent
from the Corinthiaris in bodie, but he was present with them in
spirit. So is Christ gone hence (saith he) and absent in his humanitie,
which in his diuine nature is euerie where: and in
these saiengs we reserue to both his natures their properties.
                  ¶A bodie must néedes bée in some place,Augu. ad Dardamus if it be not within
the compasse of a place, it is no where, if it be no where, it is
not.

may not thinke that his mans nature is euerie where, for we
must beware, that we doe not so stablish his diuinitie, to take awaie

of God, he is present with vs. And neuerthelesse both present &
absent, he is all one Christ.

For when it was in Earth, then verelie it was not in heauen.
And when it is in heauen, it is not surelie in earth. And so sure

                  What the booke of life is.
                  ANd there was an other booke opened, which is the Booke of
life.Apo. 20. 12 ¶This is the booke wherein the chosen are reported
to be written before the beginning of the world, by reason of the
certaintie of their Predestination, whereof thou readest thus:
either forgiue them this offence, or if thou wilt not doe it, wipe
out of the booke of life which thou hast written. Exodus. 32. 32.
Also be glad, for your names are written in heauen. Luk. 10. 20
Also whose name are in the booke of life. Phil. 4. 3. Moreouer it
is a similitude borrowed of the custome of men, who in taking
musters are wont to write the choicer sort, and to call them by
name. So is God said to take view of his seruaunts by name,
and to call them by name. Exo. 33. 12. and Iohn. 10. 3.
                     Mar. vpon the Apoc. fol. 281.
                  
                  ¶After this was an other booke opened, of a farre diuerse
nature from the other bookes, for it was the swéete booke of life,
wherein were registred all that were predestinate to be saued
from the worlds beginning. And this booke is, the eternall predestination
of God.

                  And I will not wipe him out of the booke of life.Apoc. 3. 5. ¶To bée
wiped out of the booke of life, is as much as not to be reckoned
among the liuing, blessed, and happie sort. For the booke of life
is nothing els, but the register of the righteous which are fore
ordeined to life, according as Moses saith, Exo. 32. 32. And as it
is written in Psal. 69. 27. and in Dan. 12. 2. This regester, saith
(Gasper Megander) doth God reserue in his owne kéeping: And
therefore it is nothing els but his eternall dteermination fore
purposed in his brest. In like manner Dauid saith: let them
be wiped out of ye booke of the liuing. Psal. 69. 27. that is to saie,
let them not be reckoned among Gods chosen, whom he allotteth
to the possession of his church and kingdome. In this booke

of life, that is to saie, in this election or choice, determination,
purpose, knowledge or predestination of God, there is not registred
ante misbeléeuing Turke, anie wicked Iewe, anie vn

they turne to the Lord, & acknowledge Christ the onelie sonne
of God. For none be written in it, but such as beléeue aright in
Christ. And that we maie read this booke, we need not to climbe
vp into heauen with the worldlie wise men, to search out Gods
secrets: but must come to the plaine Shepheard to the Dxe

is become man, and was crucified and put to death for vs: and
if we finde our selues in Christ, then doe we reade our name
written in the booke of life. For he that beléeueth in the sonne of
God, hath euerlasting life. Iohn. 3. 36. And he shall not come to
damnation, but is passed from death to life. Iohn. 5. 24. And in
this place Christs meaning is, that he which ouercommeth not,
but like a weakling and coward shrinketh in this incounter, by
consenting to wicked errour, shall be cast awaie with shame, &
haue his name striken out of the booke of life.

                  Of what credit the bookes of Machabees
be in the scripture.
                  Saint Austen receiued it for Canonicall. But first of what
sure credite did he receiue it? The Iewes (saith he) estéeme not
the writings of the Machabees, as they doe the Lawe, the Prophets
and the Psalmes, of which the Lord himselfe hath witnessed,
as of his witnesses saieng: It was necessarie that all
things should be fulfilled that are writen in the Lawe,Luk. 24. 4
                           •
                        . and the
Psalmes and Prophets concerning me. But it hath bene

receiued of the Church, not vnprofitablie, if it be sob
                        •
                     rlie read
or heard. And Hierome teacheth without anie doubting, that
the Authoritie thereof is of no force to the prouing of Doctrines.
And it euidentlie appeareth by that olde booke,Booke of Machabes which
is intituled vnder the name of Cipriane concerning the exposition
of the Crede, that it had no place at all in the olde
Church. But why do I héere striue without cause? as though
the Authour himselfe did not sufficientlie shewe, how much
he is to be credited, when in the ende he craueth pardon, if he
haue spoken anie thing not well. Truelie he that confesseth
his writing to néede pardon, saith plainlie that they are not
the Oracles of the Holie Ghost. Beside all that, the godlinesse
of Iudas is praised for none other cause, but for that he had an
assured hope of the last resurrection, when he sent an offering
for the dead to Hierusalem. Neither doth the writer of that historie
referre that which Iudas did to be a price of redemption,
but that they might be partakers of the eternall life with the
other faithfull, that had died for their Countrey and Religion.
This doing was indéed not without superstition and preposterous
zeale, but they are more then fooles, that drawe a
Sacrifice of the Lawe so farre as vnto vs: forasmuch as we
knowe that things doe cease by the comming of Christ, that
then were in vse.

bodie, and the Cup to be his bloud: and in the same booke hée
writeth thus also: The Bread wherein the thankes be giuen,
is the bodie of the Lord. And yet againe in the same booke hée
saith, that Christ taking bread of the same sort that our bread is
off, confessed that it was his bodie: and that the thing which was
tempered in the Chalice was his bloud.Lib. 5. And in the fift booke he
writeth further, that of the Chalice

verie material bread, a creature of God, and of such sort as other
bread is, which we doe vse, called that his bodie, when hée said:
This is my bodie, and the wine also which doth féede and nourish
vs, he calleth his bloud.

bread, which doth represent his bodie. ¶For the
vnderstanding of this place, you must know that there was an
Heretike called Marcion,
                     Martion. which did reproue creatures, & saide
that all manner of creatures were euill. This thing doeth
Tertulian improue by the Sacrament and saith: Christ did
not reproue or discommend bread, the which doth represent
his bodie. As though he should saie, If Christ had counted
the bread euill, then would hée not haue lefte it for a Sacrament,
to represent his bodie, meaning that it is a Sacrament,
token, signe, and memoriall of his bodie, & not the bodie it selfe.
And that this his meaning, doth plainlie appeare in his sourth
booke as followeth.
                  Christ taking bread and distributing vnto his Disciples,Tert. li. 4. cōt. Mar.
made it his bodie, saieng: This is my bodie. But this could
not haue bene a true figure of it, except Christ had had a true
bodie: for a vaine thing or fantasie can take no figure.
                  ¶For the vnderstanding of this place, you must marke,
that this Heretike Marcion against whom this Authour writeth,
did holde opinion, that Christ had no naturall bodie, but
onelie a phantasticall bodie, the which Tertulian improueth
by the Sacrament of the Altar, saieng: The Sacrament
is a figure of his bodie, Ergo Christ had a true bodie, for a vaine
thing or fantasie can take no figure.
                  After the mysticall Easters Lambe fulfilled,Hierome sup. Mat. and that
Christ had eaten the Lambes flesh with the Apostles, hée
tooke bread which comforteth the heart man, and passeth to
the true Sacrament of the Easters Lambe, that as Melchisedech
brought foorth Bread and Wine figuring him, so
might he likewise represent the truth of his bodie, &c.
                  ¶Héere doth Saint Hierome speake after the manner of
Tertulian before: That Christ with his bread and wine did
represent the truth of his bodie. For except he had had a true
bodie, he could not leaue a figure of it, nor represent it vnto
vs: for a vaine thing or fantasie can haue no figure, nor cannot
be represented. As by example, how canne a man
make a figure of a Dreame,Dreame. or represent it vnto our memorie.
But CHRIST hath left vs a figure and representation

of his bodie in bread and wine. Therefore it followeth
that he had a true bodie. This thing S. Bede doth more copeouslie
set forth, writing vpon S. Luke.

their natures. And in his second Dialogue he saith more
plainelie. For (saith he) as the bread and wine after the consecration,
loose not their proper nature, but kept their former
substaunce, forme and figure, which they had before: euen so
the bodie of Christ after his ascention, was chaunged into the
godlie substaunce.

and proue it by that which Paule writeth: The bread which
we breake, is it not the communicating of the bodie of Christ:
they aunswere that the bread in that place maie signifie flesh,
as it doth oftentimes in the holie Scriptures. But they ought
to remember, that Paule wrote these words in Gréeke, & not
in Hebrue. But Arnos, that is bread in Gréeke cannot signifie
as Lechem maie in Hebrue. Farther in the holie Supper, the
flesh of Christ is not broken, but they are Symboles or Signes

                  And when he had broken them.Ma. 14. 19 ¶The breaking of bread
was so common and vsuall with Christ, that by the same hée
was knowne to his two Disciples, as they were going to
Emaus. This manner of broaking of bread was verie fatherlike
and commendable among the elders of olde time, as it is hetherto
in manie places, and after the same sort, best beséeming
and belonging vnto Christ by whom we are all fed. Furthermore,
this breaking of bread hath in it selfe a signe to diuide,
as appeareth by this place of the Prophet: Breake thy lofe to
the hungrie. For a lofe cannot refresh manie without it be broken
and diuided. And by this meanes it aunswereth and is agréeable
to the mysterie of the communicating the bodie of the
Lord. The Apostle saieng: The bread which we breake is it
not the participation of the bodie of the Lord? not that the bodie
of Christ is therefore said to be broken, because it hath in it
selfe some cut: but because it is made communicable, that is,
apt and meete to be participated and receiued of manie. The
Apostle Paule saith in an other place in the person of Christ.1. Cor. 11.
This is my bodie which is broken for you, in stéed of the which
Saint Luke hath,Luk. 22. 19 which is giuen for you, &c.

                  In the Scripture a man is said to be our brother, 4. manner
of waies, that is to saie, by nature, by countrie, by kinred,
and affection. By nature brethren are, as Esau and Iacob, the
twelue Patriarches,Brethren 4. vvaies. 
                     Andrew and Peter, Iames and Iohn. By
Countrie brethren are said to be, as the Iewes, which among
themselues were called brethren, as in Deut. If thou buy thy
brother which is an Hebrue, he shal serue thée six years. And so
S. Paule, I haue wished my selfe to be accursed from Christ
for my brethren and kinsmen, according to the flesh. By kinred
they are said to be brethren which come of one house, that
is, when of one stocke, a multitude doe spring as in Genesis,
Abraham said to Lot. Let ther be no contentiō betwéene thée
and me, and betwéene my Shepheardes and thy Shephearde
because we are all brethren. And againe, Laban said to Iacob,
because thou art my brother, thou shalt not serue me fréelie
for nothing. Those that bée brethren by affection are diuided
into two sortes, into spirituall and common. They are spirituall
brethren which are Christians, as in the Psalme. 133.
                  Beholde how ioyfull a thing it is, brethren to dwell together
in vnitie. Commonly we be called brethren, because we came
all of one brother. By this diuision it is, apparaunt that they
were sayde to be the brethren of CHRIST, by kinred
not by nature, not by Countreie nor affection.
                  Therefore as Ioseph was called the Father of Christ,

euen so were they said to be his brethren, & that both in one
respect. For Ioseph was thought to be the Father of Iesus,
and so were Iames & Ioses and others, thought to be his brethren.
But none will contend about this, but such as be too
curious.

maie choose that daie whereon he setteth forward, a confessor,
or confessours, or els in his iourneie by the waie, or in anie
other place: vnto the which confessour or ghostlie Father,
we giue full power to giue absolution in all causes that concerne
the Popes owne prerogatiue,Popes Bull. in as ample manner, as if
our owne person were present. Item we graunt, that if anie
béeing confessed die by the waie, that he shall bée frée and discharged
from all their sinnes: And farthermore, we commaund
the Angels of Paradise (that his soule béeing fullie deliuered
from Purgatorie) they receiue it into Paradise. In an other
Bull, he writeth thus. We will not that anie man be formented
in himself with the paine of hell: And also we graunt to al
those that weare the crosse, thrée or foure soules at their pleasure,
whom soeuer they will, to deliuer them out of Purgatorie.

                  There was a certeine Priest,Priest. which comming before the
Pope, cast the Popes Bull downe before his féete, saieng: Loe,
héere take your Bull vnto you, for it doth me no good at all.
I haue laboured now these thrée yeares with all, and yet notwithstanding
for all this your Bull, I cannot be restored to
my right. The Pope hearing this, commanded the poore Priest
to be seourged, and after to be cast into prison, what became
of him afterward, the writer of the Storie Henricus de Erphodia,

                  How Doctour Whittington was slaine
with a Bull.
                  There was a faithfull woman that suffered martyrdome
in a certeine towne called Cheping Sadberie, in ye time of king
Henrie the seuenth, condemned by the Chauncelour called doctour
Whittington.
                     Whittington. At whose death a great concourse of people
there gathered together to beholde hir end. Among the which
the foresaid Chauncellour was there present to sée execution
done. The Sacrifice béeing ended, the people began to returne
homeward, comming from the burning of this blessed martyr.
It happened in the meane time, that as the Catholike executioners
were buisie in slaieng this séelie lambe at the towne
side, a certeine Butcher in the towne was as buisie in slaieng
of a Bull, which Bull he had fast bounde in ropes, readie to
knocke him on the head. But the Butcher (belike not so skilfull
in his art of killing beastes, as the Papists be in murthering
Christians) as he was lifting his Axe to strike the Bull;,
sailed in his stroke and smit a little too lowe, or els howe hée
smote I know not. This was certeine that the Bull; although
some what gréeued at the stroke, but yet not striken downe, put
his strength to the ropes, and brake loose from the Butcher into
the streete, the verie same time as the people were comming
in great prease from the burning. Who séeing the Bull comming
towards them, and supposing him to be wilde (as was no
other like) gaue waie for the beast, euerie man shifting for
himselfe as well as hée might. Thus the people giuing backe,
and making a lane for the Bull, he passed through the throng

of thein, touching neither man nor childe, till hée came where
the Chauncellour was. Against whome the Bull, as pricked
with a sodeine vehementie, ranne full but with his hornes,
and taking him vpon the panch, gored him through & through,
and killed him immediatlie, carrieng his guttes and trailing
them with his hornes all the stréet ouer, to the great admiration
and wonder of all them that sawe it.

them, neither from the colde, neither yet from
heate, but after their owne phantasies, they
made with pretie boughs and twigs of trées, such little pretie
lodgings as we call Cabens or Boothes. And it so chaunced
that Caine béeing verie olde and also wearie, happened one
daie to laie him downe to rest in a bush that was enclosed
with gréene boughs as aforesaid. And Lamech one of y• kinred
of Caine in the fift degrée, who by reason of his greate age
had lost his sight, and yet at a time was disposed to go abrode
to kill some wilde beast. And taking his Bowe and Arrowes,
he toke also a little boie to leade and direct him, where hee
might haue a good shoote. And when he drew somewhat néere
vnto the bush where Caine laie, the little boie espieng the bush
to wagge, & séeing as it were a great thing in the midst therof,
he imagined that there laie some wilde beast, and the boye
béeing afraide thereof, gaue knowledge to olde Father Lamech,
that in a bush standing right before him,Gen. 4. 23. & not farre off,
there laie a great and terrible beast. And Lamech vppon the
report of the childe, stretched out his arme, & drew a straight
draught toward the bush, where he slew his cosin Caine, that
laie in the same after he had liued. 730. yeares, as saith Philo.

                  Manie are called,Ma. 22. 14 &c. ¶Christ speaketh of the externall calling
by the preaching of the Gospell, of y• which there are three
degrées. All men are called, yea, euen they which heare not,
these which are dumme and are deafe minded, are also called.
The second sort enter in, and promise that they will serue
God, neuertheles their consciences condemneth them, because

they haue not the true root. As Symon Magus, which did faine
himselfe to beléeue of the faithful, being conuicted in his conscience
by the truth of the Gospell professed the same, but he
had no roote, as Peter casteth him in the téeth. Such are they
trulie to whom the Lord sendeth his holie spirit, and whome
for a time he illuminateth, but at the length by the iust desert
of their ingratitude he forsaketh them, and striketh them with
great blindnesse.
                        
                           〈…〉
                        
                      The third calling is speciall & of great efficacie,
by the which God doth verie much aduance the elect &
faithfull onelie, when that by the inward lightening of the
spirit, he bringeth to passe, that the word preached abideth in
their hearts. To these, testimonie is giuen by the same spirit,
that they are the adopted sonnes of God. We cannot iudge
who are the elect and who are the reprobate: for we ought to
leaue this iudgement vnto God. Notwithstanding by signes
there maie be some coniecture had, but we must alwaies beware
of rash iudgement. Euerie man that is elected and
chosen of God, is fullie certified in himselfe of his calling. The
which thing we maie dailie beholde. For manie are brought
into the Church, which afterward fall awaie from the same,
either béeing terrified by persecution, or els béeing ouercome
with some other temptation. Such trulie are of ye number of
them that are called, but are not elected, for héereby our election
is proued, if we perseuer vnto the last end.
Mar. fol. 51.
                  
                  ¶First, all men be generallie called, euen those that doth
not heare the word, for vnto them both heauen and earth, and
and the creatures comprehended therein, doth not cease to
preach the almightie power of God, and also his goodnesse and
mercie, so that all men (as the Apostle saith) are vnexcusable
before the maiestie of God. And with them maie be comprehended
those that heare the word, who (though they be called)
be so deafe in their hearts and mindes, that they will neither
giue care nor héede to the calling. The second sort that be
called, doe professe the Christian religion, & receiue the word,
but it hath no true root in them as Symon Magus being conuinced
in his heart, y• the gospel was true, did for a time professe,
but because it had no root in him, he did soone fall awaie
from it. Such are them to whom y• Lord doth giue his holy spirit,
illuminating thē for a time, but after ward he doth forsake

them, because of their ingratitude and vnthankfulnesse, & doth
strike them with great blindnesse. The third manner of calling
is both particular and also most effectuall. For by it the Lord
doth onelie call his elect and chosen, and whom he hath ordeined
before vnto life euerlasting, working so in them by the
inward operation of his holie spirit, that the word preached
to them doth take root in their hearts, and bringeth foorth fruit
vnto life eternall. He doth also by the same spirit testifie vnto
them, I meane vnto their spirites, that they be the children of
God, and heires of the kingdome of heauen.

                  Of two manner of callings.
                  There are two sortes of vocation, the one outward and the
other inward. By the outward vocation, I meane a common
and generall vocation, by the which God doth call by his outward
preaching, all those to whom the Gospell is preached, bée
they chosen or reprobates. And by the inward I vnderstand, a
vocation wherby God doth not onelie call men by the outward
preaching of his word, but maketh them to feele the power and
efficacie of the same by his holie spirit, in such sort that they
doe not onelie heare it with their outward eares, but doe also
receiue it into their hearts by faith, whereby they are iustified.
Pet. Viret.
                  
                  ¶The calling of God, is of two sorts: the one is common,
whereby men in déede are after a sort stirred vp, but they

bowed, for that those things which are offered please them
not: but the other is a conuenient, apt, & mighty calling, wherby
the mindes are touched, and truelie chaunged. After this
manner was Iacob called, and not Esau. Therefore the one
was beloued, and the other hated, the one drawne, and the other
forsaken.

                  IT is easier for a Camel,Ma. 19. 24 &c. ¶The latin text is: Facilius est
Camelum acus transire. This worde Camelum a Camell, in
y• English translation, is expounded of some to signifie in this
place the Cabell of a Ship: and truelie that doth better agrée
to the eie of a nedle. And yet Pollux writing of y• instruments
perteining to a ship, maketh mention of this word Camelus, &
Suidas onelie is found to vnderstand this word in that signification: yet vnderstanding it so, as it is written with (i) & not
with (e) as Camilos, and not Camelos.
                  
                  For though there be a little difference in the wordes, yet
notwithstanding in sense there is greate contrarietie, for
the first signifieth a beast called a Camell, and the other
signifieth a Rope or Cable of a Shippe. Other some

doe rather agrée to Hierom which followeth Origen, which taketh
this word Camelum being a Gréeke word (as we shewed
before) for the beast called a Camell. For Christ would haue it
seeme altogether as impossible for a rich man trusting in his riches
to enter into the kingdome of heauen, as for a Camell being
a monstrous beast to goe through the eie of a néedle. But
& if this saieng seeme to anie man obscure, let them remember
the man reprehended of the Lord, which went to plucke y• mote
out of his brothers eie, and could not sée the beame in his owne
eie. What can be more absurd, then to saie that a man carieth a
beame in his eie? But this absurditie of his words, hath a great

the holinesse of their owne life, thereby to guide them in their

more then sufficient, or but euen that I haue néede of. And it
(because I mistrust God, and haue no hope in him, and therfore
praie not to him) commeth not, then I mourne, forrowe, & pine
awaie, and am whole vnquiet in my heart. Or whether I haue
too much, or but sufficient, and loue it inordinatelie: then I care
for the kéeping. And because I mistrust God, and not hope
in him that he will helpe me, therefore, when I haue locked
dores, chambers and cofers, I am neuer the néerer at rest, but
care still, and cast a thousand waies and perills, of which y• most
part were not in my might to auoide, if I neuer slept, & where
this care is, there can the word of God haue no resting place, but
is choked vp, as soone as it is sowen.

of diuelish dreames, of associate spirits. Euse. li. 4. cap. 7. Carpocrates
patched his opinions out of Simon, Menander, Nicholas,
Saturnius, Basilides. Besides the wicked doctrine of these Heretikes
which he maintained, he worshipped as Epiphanius saith,
the Images of Iesus, of Paule, Pythagoras Plato, Aristotle, &c.
He denied that the bodie should be saued.

also the world to be made by Angels. He reiected the olde Law,
and denied the generall resurrection. He denied that Christ was
borne of the virgin Mary, saieng he was gotten of the séede of
Ioseph. Also that his bodie suffered, and that his soule onelie
was receiued into heauen. He liued about the yere of our Lord.

were so called, because from the vpper parts they had certaine
chinkes and holes, which were like windowes, so that through
them, they had light sufficient within. And y• same places were
verie hansome for men to dwell in thē 
                     R. Leui. saith, y• through
those holes and cliftes, which were like windowes, spies, when
they saw the Madianites comming, did vse either by kindeling
of fires or by some other token to giue knowledge vnto the Hebrues,
whereby they might gather their stuffe, fruits and cattels
into the dennes, and lead them awaie from the enimies which
were comming by. For dennes were not in mountaines, but
places vnder the earth in the fields being darke and without
light, wherein men did not dwell, but they might after a sorte,
hide their things and goods. But Caues in Latine are called
Specus, a speciendo, which is to behold and looke vpon, because
out of them as out of high places, they which were ther, vsed to

the Gospell when it is offered them, & that the other receiue
it by faith.
               
               
                  Aunswere.
                  It is not to be meruailed at, when men by their vnbeliefe
and vnkindnesse reiect the Gospell: but it is meruaile that some
are found that doe receiue it by faith. For that all men being
corrupted with sin, is of such peruerse nature & wickednes, that
they cannot nor will not beleeue in God, nor follow his word.
And though that manie of contrarie nature be found, which
not onelie receiue by faith the word of God & Iesus Christ our
Lord, but are also readie to laie downe their life & to adandon
the same for the confession of their faith, vnderstand they are not
such of nature, but by the grace of God, by ye which they are renued

sinneth, wherefore the cause of sinne, is not to be laied in him.

                  How the successe maketh not the cause either good or bad.
                  If the successe be euill, the cause is not therfore straight way
euill. Neither if the successe be good, is y• cause therfore straight
way good. Nabuchodonozer destroied Iewrie, and led away the
Nations that were adioining, captiues into Babilon, & yet was
not his cause therefore good: Gods cause indéede was iust, for
he would by that meanes take vengeance of a rebellious people.
But Nabuchodonozer thought nothing els but to exercise
his tyrannie. Ioseph because he would auoid adulterie, was cast
into prison, and yet was not his cause therefore euer a whit the
worse. Dauid was reiected of Absalom, & yet was not Absaloms
cause therefore any whit the better. In our time Princes that
are Protestants, haue had euill successe in warre, & yet is therefore
not y• cause of the Gospell to be thought y• worse. The Beniamites
now got the victorie more then once or twice, in a cause
most wicked. The holie Martyrs in our time are most miserarablie
slaine of Tyrants, & that with most cruell kinde of torments,
and yet we nothing doubt, but their cause is most excellent.
England had of late, as touching the word of God & truth,
a Church most rightlie instituted, which was afterward miseblie disiected and seperated: neither followed it thereby that the
cause of Religion was euill. But now thankes be giuen vnto
God that hath restored it.

to his vowe. For according to the Lawe of Moses, they
that vowed themselues to God, were commanded to suffer their
haire to growe, as long as they would continue Nazarites, and
afterward to sheare it, & to burne it. This did Paule not forgetting
what he had before decréed with y• Apostles touching the abolishing of y• law. But lest the Iewes which beleeued, shuld be
offended, he fained himselfe a Iew, to win y• Iewes.

he had no flesh, nor suffered anie passion, but séemed onely to
suffer. He affirmed that God which is declared in the Lawes &
Prophets to be God, was not the father of our Sauiour Christ,
forsomuch as he was knowen, the other vnknowen. The one
was iust, the other was good. It was his doctrine also, that some
creatures of themselues were euill, & that they were not made
of the God that was the chiefe goodnesse, but of another God of
all naughtinesse, whom he called the chiefe or principall mischiefe.
He was about the yeare of our Lord. 144.

                  SO long as it maie be vnderstood of all people what is ment
by them, and so long as they serue the people & preach one
thing or other, they hurt not greatlie. Although the free seruant

                  Our grieuous fall and horrible blindnesse wherein we were
so déepe and so deadlie brought a sléepe, is to be imputed vnto
nothing els then to the multitude of Ceremonies. For as soone

it superfluous to preach the plaine text anie longer, & the Law
of God, the faith of Christ, the loue towards our neighbour, and
the order of our iustifieng and saluation, forasmuch as all such
things were plaied before the peoples faces dailie in the Ceremonies:
but got them to Allegories, faining them euery man

from thence vnto disputing and wasting their braines, about
words, not attending the significations, vntill at the last, the
laie people had lost the meaning of the Ceremonies, and looking
on the holinesse of the déedes, to be iustified by dooing of them,
they made them Image-seruice, hatefull to God, and rebuked of

                  I thinke all Ceremonies (or Traditions) are to be refused,
which are against the word of God, which are idle, vaine & vnprofitable,
which are vnhonest and vncomelie, which haue but a
shew of superstition, which are grieuous and burdenous.

                  INto the parts of Cesarea Philippi. ¶This Cesarea is at
the riuer of Iordan, and was called at the first, Panneas,
but afterward it was called, Cesarea Philppi, by Philip the
sonne of Herode the great, & the brother of the Tetrarch which
beheaded Iohn. The which Cesarea also after that for the honour
of Nero,

by Iosephus, in his. 18. booke of the Antiquities of the Iewes, &
the 3. chapter. But the bound or borders of this Cesarea Philippi,
was the Region of the Iewes, wherevpon it was inhabited
both by the Syrians and Iewes together. Of this citie there
is often mention made in Luke in the Actes of the Apostles.
There is also another Cesarea, namelie that auncient and noble
Cesarea, which at the first was called the Tower of Strato.
                  
                  This Citie Herode the great builded betwéene Dora & Ioppa,
and for the loue of Augustus Cesar, he called it Cesarea. Of this
first Cesarea our Euangelist maketh mention, and because hée
would make a difference, he called it Cesarea Philippi.

Fish, the bodie of a Wolfe, and the taile of a Dolphin fish, as

                  AChariot (which we call a Cart) was a certeine Engine of
warre,Psal. 20. 7. made with long and sharpe pikes of yron, set in the
forefront, and with thrée sharpe pointed swords on either side.
And behind it had sharp crooked yrons made much like Sithes,
or rather like Sickles for the crookednesse thereof, And of these
manner of sharpe, yrons, they are called in the first of Iudicum, &
diuers other places of the olde Testament: Currus falcati, sickle
Carts The Horses y• did draw these Cartes were wel harnessed,
& especiallie the men y• rode vpon them. These Chariots

was a terrible kinde of Engine, and in great price among the
Aegyptians, as it appeareth by king Pharao, when he followed
the Children of Israel with 
                        •
                     00. of chosen Chariots. And
in what estimation they were in among the Philistines, ye
shall find in the first booke of the Kings. 13. Chapter, that they
came against king Saule with thirtie thousand Chariots, beside
other horsemen and warriours a great number. Vigetius
in his third booke de re militari, saith that Chariots wer most
vsed of Darius, Antiochus and Mithridates: but at length the
Romanes inuented a trick, that caused Chariots to be nothing
set by. The inuention was this: They inuented Caltropes,
which when the Chariot came nigh vnto them with a great
race & mightie force, they did cast from them their Caltropes,
which pricked their horses in the féete so sore, that down came
the Chariots, horsemen and all. This inuention saith Vigetius,
caused chariots to be laid down. But héere in this realme
of England, they were had in vse and great price, at such time
as Iulius Caesar (after he had conquered Fraunce) came into
the land called Britaine: Iulius Caesar doth not call them Currus
falcatus, but he in his 5. booke of his Commentaries doth cal
thē 
                     Esseda, & the chariot driuers Essedarij. These be his words:
Equites Britaniorum Essedarij
                           •
                         acriter praelio, cum equitatu
nostra in itinere confluxerunt: The horsemen of the Britaines
and their chariot men verie fiercelie did sette vppon our men
saith Iulius Caesar. Thus ye sée in what estimation Chariots
were in the old time, insomuch that the Prophet Dauid (which
had all his confidence in the Lords helpe) said: Hij in curribus,
& hij in equis, &c. Some put their trust in horses, and
some in chariots, but we will put our trust in the name of the
Lord our God.

                  Because they had yron Chariots.Iudi. 1. 19. ¶He that shall reade
the Iliades of Homer, shal easelie perceiue, that the men in the
olde time vsed Chariots in battailes, and also the same may
be gathered both out of the most auncient histories, & also out
of the later writers, & amongst other, Quintus Curtius writing
the life of Alexander, doth plainlie make mention of such
Chariots in the battaile 
                        •
                     ought against Darius. But I thinke
no Writer writeth more plainlie of them, then doeth Plinie.
For he in that Battailes wherein Antiochus was ouercome

of the Romanes, which is in the 4. Decade, and 7. booke, thus describeth
Chariots,Chariots described which he calleth hooked. He saith that they
were chiefelie fonsed after this manner. The points about the
draught trée standing out from the yoke, had as it were hornes,
wherewith, whatsoeuer they met, they might thrust it through,
and two hookes hong out at the ende of the Cart, the one euen
with the Cart, the other fastened downeward to the earth. The
former serued to cut a sonder, whatsoeuer came on the side of it,
the other was made to crush them, which fell downe, and went
vnder. There were also two sundrie hookes fastened after the
same sort, to the Exeltrées of both the wheeles, &c. The vse therfore
of these Chariots, endured till y• time that An
                           •
                        ochus was
ouercome. Howbeit we neuer read that y• 
                     Romanes vsed them,
And that they were horible to behold, and hard to be conquered,
maie manifestlie be gathered by the booke of Iosua: for there
in the 17. Chapter, when the Tribe of Ioseph complained, because
it was so manie in number, and had obtained so narrow a
Lot, Iosua commaunded this, that if they had not roome inough,
they should go and dwell or els conquere the places of their Enimies
adioining vnto them. They excusod themselues y• they
could not doe so, because their neighbours had yron Chariots.
But to repeate more auncienter things, Pharao (as it is written
in the booke of Exodus) when he persecuted the Israelites
which fled, is said to haue had Chariots, and with the same he
tooke vpon him to enter into the Sea, but they being ouerthrowen
by the power of God, he was punished for breaking his fidelitie.

                  What Charitie is.
                  CHaritie is the loue of thy neighbour. The rule of Charitie
is this: Doe as thou wouldst be done vnto: for Christ holdeth
all alike, the rich, the poore, the friend & the foe, the thankfull
and the vnthankefull, the kinsman and straunger.

of the godlie and the vngodlie. For the godlie are afflicted to
their owne profit: namelie that they maie be nurtured vnto

were married could not be chast: or though the Apostles
did write these things onelie to virgins. In the first & second

folkes both man and wife, to be chast and pure.

                  How in breaking of Chastitie, the one part may
offend, and not the other.
                  An adulterer abuseth a womans bodie against hir will, the
man doth sinne, and yet the woman is vndefiled, because hir
minde is chast and vnspotted.
                  
                     Lucretia the Romane Matrone, liueth chast for euer, of
whose bodie though proude Tarquinius Sonne had his pleasure,
yet hir minde continued still, most chast and faithfull
to hir husbande, and therefore, shée not consenting in heart
to sinne, is by Fame recorded to bée the Ornament of all
womanhood and perfect Chastitie, and therefore saith Saint
Hierom verie well, Corpus mulieris, &c. Not violence but will,
doth defile a womans bodie.
                  S. Augustine to Victorianus saith:Hiero. li. Heb. que, 
                     Ad Deum ingemiscentibus,

&c.
                     August. victoria. Epist. 122 He will euer be present with his, that sigh & grone
to God, as he hath wont to be present with his, and either he
suffereth nothing to be done in their chast bodies by diuelish
lust: or if he doth suffer, where are their minde is not defiled
with anie filthinesse of consent, he doth defend his owne flesh
from offence. And whatsoeuer either the lust of the patient,
hath either not consented vnto, nor suffered, it shalbe the fault
of the onelie doer. And all that violence shall not be imputed
for the filthines of corruption, but for the wound of suffering.
For the soundnesse of Chastitie is of such force in the minde,
that when the minde is vndefiled, chastitie cannot be defiled
in the bodie, whose members might haue bene disseuered one
from another. In another place: Magis timeamus, &c. Let
vs feare more, least the inward vnderstanding being corrupt,
the chastitie of faith, doth therewith perish, rather then least
women should be violentlie defiled in their flesh: for chastitie
is not defiled by violence, if it be kept sound and cleare in the
minde, forasmuch as none is defiled, when the will of the suffered
doth not filthelie vse the flesh, but suffereth that thing
without consent, which another doth worke by violence.
               
               
                  Of counterfait Chastitie.
                  S. Paule foretelleth of Antichrists disciples. 2. Tim. 4. that
they shall beare a great countenance of continent life, & forbid
mariage. And of such S. Hierom saith:Hierome. cap. 7. li. 2 
                     Iactant pudicitiam
suam impudenti facie: They make bragges of their chastitie,
with whorish countenaunce.

                  How nothing commeth by hap & chaunce.
                  THe prouidence of God is of that nature, that through the
immutable certaintie thereof, whereby all things be ruled,
it excludeth all chaunces and hap of fortune. I call it chance
and hap of fortune, whatsoeuer appeareth and betideth vnlooked
for, vnforeséene, at all aduentures, and without anie sure
cause or reason, so that it appeareth to be done, by no foresight
at all, neither of God neither of man, such as without number
doth befal among men in the world. Therfore looke how much
any doth yéeld vnto chaunce and fortune, so much hée doth pul
awaie from the prouidence of God. Unto good christian men

it is a cléere case, y• ther chaunceth nothing throughout all the
whole world at hazard or all aduentures with the prouidence
of God which disposeth all. Wherfore my iudgement is (sayth
Musculus) that chaunce and fortune be vaine words, and to no
purpose.

which was shot at aduenture, which thing might haue bene
seemed to haue bene done by chaunce, when as yet God in verie
déede gouerned the shot. And in like manner as Plutarch
telleth, Pirrhus was slaine of a woman in besieging Thebes,
she throwing downe a Tyle from the house toppe. Uerie manie
such thinges are done in our time, which séeme vnto vs

do both the most & best learned of the Latinists best alow, and

Expressing it by this word chaunter. Notwithstanding diuerse
Authors doe diuerslie interpret it. Some saie it signifieth to
the victor or ouercommer: Some to the victorie: which maie
thus agrée and concord together, if thou take a Psalme to bée a
stirring and an exhortation to put our trust in God, béeing sure
to obteine the victorie: And where some interprete vnto the
end, vnderstand euen the same: For therefore doe we put our
trust in God, that we maie come to ye end of the victorie. Some
translate the title thus: A vehement and often made exhortation
in instruments of musike, a Psalme to Dauid, that is as
they themselues expound it, a Psalme reuelate to Dauid, for

                     Dauid is in Hebrue the Datiue case, and not the Genitius.

is a manner of speaking, and not to be vnderstood as the words
doe sound, and it is to cut of the hand, and to plucke out the eie:
And as we commaund our children not onelye come nie a

either to looke on fire, or once to thinke on fire, which are impossible

auenge, but be prepared euen to suffer as much more, & neuer
think it lawful to auenge, how great so euer the iniurie be: for

executing of Gods commandements. And Cherubin when it is
taken for y• high order of Angels, is as much to saie in latin, as
Sciencia multitudo, the multitude of science or cunning. Of the
Angels y• be of this order, there is much mention in the Scriptures
of the olde Testament. In the third Chapter of Genesis,
we read that God did set an Angel of the high order of Cherubins,
to kéepe Adam out of Paradise. And in Exodus, whē God
sheweth to Moses the fashion of the Sanctuarie, and of y• Arke
of couenant and of the propiciatorie seate. These were dead
Images they were no liuing Angelles, but onelye ordeined
by the commaundement, partlie to adourne the
propiciatorie seate, and partlye to plucke the heartes

of the rude people, to the admiration of Gods most high glorie,
by the golden glorie of the two Cherubins, which were
made as the Hebrues say, like two young children with wings.
And by the waie, héere it might peraduenture be reasoned, why
it is not lawfull for vs then, to set vp golden Images as well
in our Churches, as it was lawfull for the Israelites to haue
golden Cherubs in their Tabernacles, they had the same commandement
that we haue, Non facies tibi scultile, Thou shalt
make thée no grauen Image. To this argument it maie be easilie
answered thus: From the time that the vaile of the Temple
was miraculouslie rent in péeces, from the toppe to the
ground at the suffering of Messias our Lord: all the Iewes
lawe apperteining either to the ciuile order of the people, either
else to the Ecclesiasticall ordering of the people, which
lawes be commonlie called Lawes Iudiciall and Lawes ceremoniall,
both these kinde of lawes were vtterlie by the vertue
of Christs passion, fulfilling that in deede, wherof they were a
figure to come, the thing beeing fulfilled, the shadowe was taken
awaie, abolished, and vtterlie abrogated. This is a plaine
& flat answere: & it serueth to the soluting of manie like kinde
of cauillations drawne out of the ceremonies and iudicials of
the olde lawe, &c.

all the earth is full of thy glorie
                        •
                      Upon these Angels called
Cherubin, that is to saie, by interpretation, the multitude
of science, y• Lord rideth. For both al knowledge is subiect vnto
God, & also he rideth vpō Cherubin. For he hath thē which of y•
propertie of swiftnesse in dooing the messenges, and executing
the commaundements of God, are called Cherub in the singular
number. i. Volucris, or Cherubin in the plurall number. i.

                     Volucres. He hath these Angels at all times to doe all his commaundements.
And this readinesse and swiftnesse of Cherubin
which are but Gods creatures and Gods messengers, doe
declare and set out vnto vs mortall men, that great maiestie of
God wonderfullie. So that these words of the Prophet. The
Lord rideth vpon Cherubin, are no more to saie, but the Lorde
is of such might & vnspeakable maiestie, y• as all men do bring
their matters quicklie to passe by the holpe of swift running
horses, so the Lord for his matters to be accomplished, in stéed
of horses he vseth swift Angels called Cherubin. And if ye cannot
(saith the Prophet) perceiue the swiftnesse of Angels, by
meanes that they are spirits inuisible, then will I declare the
incomparable speed in preferring of Gods commaundement,
by a material and sensible thing that ye dailie sée, which thing
is nothing els but the winde. The windes are of such swiftnesse,
that nothing can expresse how swiftlie they blowe from
the East, to the full West, and from the South to the full
North. They occupie no space but it is done wt ful blast, euen
sodeinlie. Euen so doth God by his infinite power work things
with such swiftnesse that as I might saie (Per presepopoliam)
volauit super pennas ventorum. He hath not ridden, but hée
hath flowen, not with swallowes winges, but with winges of
the winde: that is as much to saie, as with incomparable and
vnspeakable swiftnesse, doth God by his diuine power, bring
all things to passe, that his blessed pleasure is to be done.

                  How this Psalme made by the children of
Chore, is vnderstood.
                  A Mysticall Psalme made by the children of Chore.
                     Psal. 42. ¶We
reade in the 16. Chapter of the booke of Numeri, that a certeine
man named Chore (which was the great Nephew of the
Patriarke Leui, or els to whom Leui was Perannus his great
graund-father) with other Captaines mo, rebelled against Moses
and Aaron, whose fact displeased almightie God so sore, that
he caused the earth to open and to swallowe vp Chore with all
his companie, their wiues, children, and all their substaunce.
                  Now séeing that all his substance, wife, and children, went the
same waie that he did, how can it be true that the children of
Chore should be makers and setters foorth of this 42. Psal. of
Dauid, as the title thereof maketh mention. To this question,
aunswere is made in the 26. of Nu. where it is written, y• when
Chore was swallowed vp of the earth, God miraculouslie preserued
certeine of Chores children, of whose ofspring there
came afterward, certeine that proued verie excellent learned
men, and notable wise men, namelie these foure, Ethan, Heman,
Calcal, and Darda, as who should saie these men excelled
all other. Loe, such noble men came of the spring of Chore, of
whome the title of this Psalme and diuerse other Psalmes to
their perpetuall name and renowme, doth make mention, calling
them the children of Chore, because they sprang of y• séede
of Chore and of his children, whom God did miraculously preserue
from the swallowing of the earth, and not because they
were his naturall children. For it is well knowne that Chore
liued in Moses time, against whō he was y• chiefe in stirring vp
of rebellion against him. Againe, Ethan, Heman, Calcal, & Darda
(which were the naturall sonnes of Mahol) liued and flourished
in Salomons time, which was 400. and almost or altogether
fourescore yeares after that Chore was killed. So that
these men could not be the naturall sonnes of Chore, but
they are called his children and his sonnes, because they came of
his porgenie, and of his ofspring.

                  How God hath chosen vs, and we not him.
                  You haue not chosen me, saith Christ,Ioh. 15. 16. but I haue chosen
you. ¶Who hearing this saieng of our Lord, dare bee so bolds
as to saie, that men are chosen through beliefe, whereas rather
they are chosen that they maie beléeue, least y• they should bée
found to haue chosen Christ first, contrarie to the sentence of
the truth, vnto whom Christ saith, you haue not chosen me, but
I haue chosen you.

                  We were chosen (do some saie) before the foundations of the
world were made, because that God did foresee that we shoulde
be good, and not that he himselfe should make vs good.
               
               
                  Aunswere.
                  God saith, ye haue not chosen me, but I haue chosen you,
for if he had therefore chosen vs, because he had foreséene that
we shoulde bée good, he should also haue knowne before, that
we should haue chosen him.

                     Paule saith, that God hath not chosen manie wise men after
the flesh,1. Cor. 1. 26 nor manie men of power, nor manie noble men
borne. And yet the same man saith, God will haue all men saued:
how then doth he nor choose: God is said not to haue chosen
them, not because he would not haue them saued, but for
the sequele of it, that is to saie, because the wisedome of this
world, power, & nobilitie of birth, do like baits entice and withdrawe
manie from the obedience of the Gospell. Dauid was
rich and puissant, and so was Nero. But Dauid was not entised
by the riches and power, to fall from the Gospell, as Nero
was to his owne destruction. And so foorth of other like.

the diuell. ¶It is to bee vnderstood that there is two manner
of choosing. The one whereby the Apostles were chosen to that
most worthie office of Apostleshippe that they were in, and
the other wherby they wer chosen into life euerlasting. Therfore
when Christ saith that Iudas was chosen with the other
Apostles, that same must be vnderstood of the office wherevnto
he was called and chosen with the other. For when he speketh
of the election that doth perteine to life euerlasting, hée
doth altogether exclude him from the number of the chosen. I

of the Serpent (whom the diuell had set for his minister

and all his posteritie for euer subiect to death and all other
calamities and nuseries of this world (where afore it was in

the saluation of mankinde, promised that of the séed of the woman
Christ should come and destroie the power of Satan, and
deliuer vs frée from sinne and death.

daies, twice in the mountaine, not for the auoiding of temptation,

Father then to be published. And Elias béeing sent to anoint a
king ouer Siria, & a king and a Prophet ouer Israel, by whom
both these kingdomes should be cleane altered and chaunged,
did fast fortie daies from all maner meates,Fasted. for the declaring
of the power of God in his works. So did it please Christ of
his owne power to fast fortie daies, that the Iewes shoulde
haue none occasion to thinke him inferiour to those tw
                        •
                      their
great Prophets, in the publishing of his Gospell and gladde
tidings vnto the world, and his renuing of all things: not to
the intent that we should followe him, and thereby haue purgation
for our sinnes. For beside that, it is impossible to followe
him (without an especiall worke of the spirit) either in
that he fasted fortie daies, or in that he was neuer hungrie:
This were a plaine deniall of the benefits of his passion, and
the setting vp of our owne worke which is vnperfect. For
what great matter is it to eate meate but once euerie daie, &
to drink two or thrée times, many haue so liued in old y• time.
And what holines is it to eat fish onelie, do not Cormerants
and such as liue by the sea side, liue so like wise. Christ hath
commaunded vs to followe him in loue, peace, mercie, & such
like: But in this example (as a thing impossible) we haue no
such commaundement, except we be drawne into wildernesse
by the spirit, as Christ was, or by anie other worke of God,
we be destitute of food & the comfort of creatures. Then, loe y•
example of Christ may strength vs, & teach, that not by bread
onelie doe we liue, but by euerie word that procéed out of the

because they be inuisible and immortall spirits. But Christ to
obeie his Father, and to wash awaye the sinnes of mankinde,
was contented to yéeld himself to death for a time, to the intent
that he might at length by death, destroie him that had y• power
of death (that is to wit the diuell) and set them at libertie,
which for feare of death were subiect to bondage all their lyfe

for vs all, and thereof they inferre that his benefits is common
to all men, which thing we also will easilie graunt, if onelie
the worthinesse of the death of Christ be considered, for as
touching it, it might be sufficient for al the sinnes of the world,
but although in it selfe it bée sufficient, yet it neither had,
nor hath, nor shall haue effect in all men: which thing the
schoolemen also confesse, when they affirme that Christ hath
redéemed all men sufficientlie, but not effectuallie: for there vnto
it is necessarie that the death of Christ be healthfull vnto
vs, that we take holde of it, which cannot otherwise be done,

not. For he baptised, because it was he y• cleansed, washed, & purified the
sinne, He baptised not, bicause he vsed not the outward sacrament of dipping

                  Of Christs descending into hell, three opinions.
                  
                     Lyra saith,1. opinion y• Christs soule was 39. houres in Lymbo sanctoru
patrum. In y• place wher y• soules of y• holie Patriarks wer reserued
& kept till Christs cōming: he saith y• Christs soule was
39. houres in y• place which he calleth Lymbus, y• is to saie, frō
y• 9. houre of good fridaie, which we after our counting of y• clock
do take to be toward night, as it were about 3. of y• clocke in y•
after noone, vntil y• dawning of Easter daie in y• morning. But
I doubt of this doctrine (saith y• Author) and y• for two causes.
Once we read. y• Christ hanging vpon y• crosse, did giue vp his
soule, commending it into the handes & tuition of his Father,
saieng. Pater, in manus, &c. Againe we read, that Christ hanging
vpon the crosse, said to the good théefe that said: Remember
me O Lord, when thou shalt come into thy kingdome, Christ
answered y• thiefe & said
                        •
                      
                     Hodie mecum eris in Paradiso: This
day thou shalt be with are in paradise, weigh these words wel.
First Christ said, Hodie, to day, y• is to say, immediatly, after
thy soule shal depart out of thy body, Mecū eris, Thou shalt be
y• me, wher, In Paradiso, in paradise, what shal we cal paradise?
Shal we not vnderstād y• kingdōe of heuen by paradise, séeing y•
théefe said. Remember me whē thou cōmest into thy kingdom:
wher is Christs kingdoe but in heauen. Lyra doth wrest this
word paradise to signifie Limbū sanctorū patrū. But Theophilactus
graūteth y• paradise & the kingdō of heauē is all one thing
in vnderstāding, & yet he séemeth to lene to this conclusiō. Quod

                           •
                        ima. And yet he denieth y• théefe had y• fulnes of glory, yea, or
y• the soules of y• patriarks & other saints departed in of y• faith
of Christ, haue y• fulnesse of ioyes & glory, which they shal haue
at y• day of dome whē y• body & y• soule shalbe vnited together, &
yet he graunteth y• the théefs soule went straight to y• kingdōe
of heauē S. Augustine in an epistle y• he wrote to Euodius, affir
moth plainly: Quod anima Christi descendit ad infernos, y•
Christ in his soule while his bodie laie dead in y• graue, went
downe into hell: whom Saint Bede doth follow. Saint Hierome
in his commentaries that he written vppon y• Psalter,

(Si tamen Hieronimi sint) hath these words: Non derelinques
qua ipsa ad inferna defcendit: vt electos suos eijcerit, & diabolos
ligaret, qua antea iactitabat se esse omniū Dominū nunc
omnium seruus. And therfore S. Hierome in a certeine Epistle
hath these words: Quid homine imbecilius qui a carne sua
vincitur: quid ita homine Christi aut fortius qui diabolum &
mundum vincit? But how? Quia omnia possum in eo qui me
confortat. Because we put our trust in the name of Iesus,
which bad vs be bold vpon him, saieng: Confidete a me, quia
ego vici mundum. To tell you more of their mindes, that say
that Christ went downe into hell in his soule. Saint Gregorie
and certeine other doe adde and saie moreouer: Quod anima
Christi passasi
                           •
                         apud inferos: And that when Iohn Baptist
béeing in prison and hearing of the myracles of Christ,
sending to Christ two of his Disciples with this message, saieng:
Tu es qui venturus, an alium expectamus? The meaning
of Saint Iohn was this. Art thou he or shall wée looke
for an other, not meaning whether he were the true Messias
incarnate, for then he must haue said: Tu es quivenisti, an
alium expectamus, but Iohn said: Tu es qui venturus, an alium
expectamus. Meaning saith Saint Gregorie, that where
now I am in prison, and sée nothing but present death, what
shall I in my soule, like as I haue bene thy preacher, and thy
fore runner héere iu earth, shall I in my soule also preach vnto
the soules departed in the faith of thée to come. These bée
Saint Gregories words: Debeo te nunciare inferis, qui te
nunciam superis.
                  
                  As touching the second opinion
                        
                           •
                        . opinion that Christ descended into
hell, not personalie in his soule, Sed in spiritu: Hoc est viuifica
mortis sua virtute: that is, by the might and power of his
redēmption, that he made vpon the crosse. This opinion I haue
not saue onelie in the learned writers of this our age, which
doe proue their opinion true by the wordes of Saint Peter,
written in his first Epistle in the third and fourth Chapters,
which places vndoubtedlie are verie notable. These bée the
wordes of Saint Peter, in the third Chapter. Christus in spiri

of his manhood, and vertue of his passion, went and preached

vnto the Saints that were in prison, Of the spirites that
were in prison at the time of Christs suffering vnder Pontius
Pilate, ther wer two sundrie sorts, good & bad, the soules of Infidels,
the soules of vngodlie & wicked liuers in this wretched
world as Cain, Nemroth, the Sodomits & Gomorean
                           •
                        , the Philistines,
the Iebusites, & Iudas the traitor with his fellowes: And
the soules of the Patriarchs, Adam, Abel, Seth, Noe, Abraham,
Isaac, Iacob, Dauid and all other soules of holie men, and faithfull
beléeuers in Christ to come. All flesh, both good and badde
were in prison, till at the suffering of Christ vpon the Crosse:
but yet not all in one prison. The soules of the Saints, that is,
of good men, were by themselues in one societie or fellowship,
which the Gospell calleth the Bosome of Abraham, and S. Peter
calleth it a prison, in respect of the infinite pleasures: To
both these sorts of spirits or soules Christ preached, but after a
sundry sort. To the good sort he preached redemption & satisfaction
for their sinnes, paied by Christ vpon the crosse, and therevpon
receiued them into heauen vnto himselfe. To the soules of
the sinfull, he preached perpetuall paines in Hell neuer to haue
ende, but bound, and to burne continuallie with the Diuell,
whom they did serue when they were aliue. Of the wicked and
damned soules S. Peter giueth an example, by whome all the
world maie take héede. Of the good soules he giueth no example.
But of the damned soules he giueth now example by them

of Noe: when the long suffering of God abode excéeding patientlie,
but in conclusion, there were no moe saued from drowning,
sauing onelie eight persons. That the meaning of S. Peter
in the third chapter, should be this that I haue recited, That is,
that Christ in the spirit, that is, in the power and vertue of his
passion, descended into hell, these learned and godlie writers do
proue by the exposition that Saint Peter maketh of his owne
words, in the next Chapter following, where he saith thus:
Mortuis euangelizatum est, vt iudicentur quidem secundum
homines in carne, viuant autem secundum Deum in spiritu.
The Gospell was preached vnto the dead, that they should bée
iudged in the flesh after the fashion of men, but in the Spiritshould liue after the fashion of the sonne of God. Héere Saint
Peter séemeth to make answere to a secret question that might

haue bene asked, which is this: If the Gospell, that is the tidings
of their redemption by the merites of Christs passion
was preached the deliuerance of the faithfull that wer in prison:
how came they out, with their bodies or without their bodies. S.
Peter answereth, y• they came out with their soules alone, for as
concerning their bodies they shalbe iudged secundum homines,
after the fashion of men, that is to saie at ye daie of doonie. Thus
I haue rehearsed to you the second Opinion.
                  Now shall yée heare briefelie of the third Opinion,3. Opiniō
                      which
is that these words: Christus descendit ad inferna, is no distinct
nor seuerall article of our Crede, but rather an exposition of the
former clause, et sepultus est, he was buried. They that be of
this Opinion they bring these reasons, for the proofe of their
assertion. First S. Cipriane expounding the Crede, doth make
no exposition thereoff, but he saith: Haec verba non habentur
in symbolo romano. Erasmus expounding the Crede, séemeth to
allow verie much the sentence of S. Cypriane. Insomuch, that
he saith that Inconcin

                        itas sermonis, i. the disordred speach proueth
these words to be added, for the exposition of these wordes:
Et sepultus est, otherwise it is the cart before the horse: yea,
Erasmus is so plaine, that it is but a patch added vnto y• Crede:
that he thinketh that S. Thomas, not Thomas the Apostle, but
Thomas Aquina did adde to the Crede these words, Descendit
ad inferna. These be Erasmus words: An Thomas Aquina addidit
sub dubito. Furthermore they bring in for their purpose,
this argument in the Crede read at the holie Communion called
Symbolum necenum. And likewise in the Counsell set forth
in the thrée other generall counsells, ther is no mention of these
words, Descendit ad inferna. And where as Athanasius in his
Crede, which we call Quicun
                           
                              
                           
                           que
                         vult, hath these words, Descendit
ad inferna, they graunt, but yet onlie in steed of these words,
Et sepultus est, which all other Credes haue. And Athanasius
vsed in the stéed therof, Descendit ad inferna. And to proue Descendere
in infernum may rightly signifie I was buried, they
alledge the words of Iacob, dolens Ioseph discerptum a bestia,
Descendam ad filium meum lugens in infernū morietur pater
noster, & deducent samuli tui cauos eius, cum dolore ad infernum.

Pet. Mar. vpon the Ro. fo. 199.
                  
                  We denie not, (saith Cyrill
                     Ciril. li. 
                           •
                        0 cap. 13 against the heretike) but we bée
spirituallie ioined to Christ, by faith and sincere charitie: but
that we should haue no manner of coniunction in our flesh

with Christ, that we vtterlie denie, and thinke it vtterlie discrepant
from Gods holie Scriptures. For who doubteth but
Christ is so the Uine trée, and we so the braunches, as we get
thence our life. Heare what S. Paule saith, we be all one bodie
with Christ, for though we be manie, we be one in him. All
we participate in one seede. Thinketh this hereticke, that wée
knowe not the strength & vertue of the mysticall benediction,
which when it is made in vs, doth it not make Christ by communication
of his flesh to dwell corporallie in vs? Why be the
members of faithfull mens bodies, called the members of
Christ? And, Shall I make the members of Christ, parts of the
whores bodie? GOD forbid. And our Sauiour also saith:
He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my bloud, dwelleth in me,
and I in him. ¶Although in these words Cyrill doth saie,
that Christ doth dwell corporallie in vs, when we receiue the
mysticall benediction, yet he neither saith that Christ dwelleth
corporallie in the Bread, nor that he dwelleth in vs corporallie
onelie at such times as we receiue the Sacrament, nor that he
dwelleth in vs, and not we in him: but he saith as well, that
we dwell in him, as that he dwelleth in vs. Which dwelling
is neither corporall nor locall, but an heauenlie, spirituall and
supernaturall dwelling whereby so long as we dwell in him,
& he in vs, we haue by him euerlasting life. And therfore Christ
saith in the same place, that Christ is the Uine and we are the
braunches, because that by him we haue life. For as the braunches
receiue life and nourishment of the bodie of the vine, so
receiue we by him, the naturall propertie of his bodie, which
is life and immortalitie, and by these meanes, we being his
members doe liue and are nourished. And this meant Cyrill
by this word Corporallie in vs.Corporallie And the same meant also S.
Hilarius by this word Naturallie,Naturalie when he said, Christ dwelleth
naturallie in vs. And as Saint Paule when he said, that in
Christ dwelled the full diuinitie corporall, by the word corporallie
he meant not that the Diuinitie is a bodie, and so by that
bodie dwelleth bodilie in Chist. But by the word corporallie he
ment, that the diuinitie is not in Christ, accidentallie, lightly,
slenderlie: but substanciallie and perfectlie, with all his might
and power: so that Christ was not onelie a mortall man to
suffer for vs, but also he was an immortall GOD able to

redéeme vs, &c.

                  Christ by his Godhead (saith S. Austen) is euer with vs: but
vnlesse he had departed awaie bodilie from vs, we should euer
more carnallie sée his bodie. These words are speciallie to bée
noted: If Christ were bodilie héere, he should carnallie be séene.
Therfore S. Austens iudgement, if Christ wer bodilie present
in the Sacrament, we should sée him carnallie in the sacrament.
                  A man maie haue Christ verely present,August. in Iohn tract. 50 though he haue him
not in his mouth. For thus S. Austen saith. Habes Christum
in presenti, &c. Thou hast Christ in the time present, by his
signe or token: in the time present by faith, in the time present
by the Sacrament of Baptime.
                  Christ is present in the Sacraments, as they teach that hée
is present in his word, when he worketh mightelie by y• fame,
in the harts of the hearers, by which manner of speach it is not
ment that Christ is corporallie present in the voice or sound of
the speaker (which sound perisheth, as soone as the words be spoken)
but this speach meaneth, that he worketh with his word,
vsing the voice of the speaker, as his instrument to worke by, as
he vseth also Sacraments, whereby he worketh, and therfore is
said to be present in them.

diuerslie giuen, for vpon the Crosse, Christ was carnallie giuen

eaten, & was eaten indéed before his supper, yea, & before
his incarnation also. Of which eating, & not of the sacramental
eating he spake in the 6. of Iohn: My flesh is verie meate, & my

should saie: whie doe we then drinke bloud & eate flesh, and so
should be troubled: for when he spake these things, they were
offended with his words, & because that should not also chance,
he himselfe drankeDranke first of it, that he might cause them to come
without feare to the partaking of those mysteries. ¶Heere Chrisostome
noteth that Christ dranke of it, to draw them from the
grose vnderstanding of his words, & by his drinking to testifie
vnto them, that it was not his naturall flesh indéed, but memorials
& representations of his bodie and bloud.

was borne in his owne hands, & doth expound himselfe in another
place,Bare himselfe saieng: Ferebatur tanquam in manibus: that is, he
was borne after a certeine manner in his owne hands. And by
that y• he saith after a certaine manner, we may soone perceiue
what he meaneth. Howbeit if S. Austen had not expounded
himselfe, yet he saith ad Bonifacium, that the Sacrament of a
thing, hath a similitude or propertie of the thing which it signifieth.
And so he saith y• he bare himselfe, because he bare the sacrament
of his bodie and bloud, which did so earnest expresse
himselfe, as nothing might more doe it.

Sauiour, to admonish vs, that he was sent vnto vs from the father
to saue vs, & that we maie haue saluation by none other
but by him onelie. His Offices be these thrée: A Prophet, a
King, a Sacrificator, for the name of Christ signifieth annointed,
& because that in the auntient Church of Israel, y• Priests,
Kings and Sacrificators were annointed by the ordinance of
God, in testimonie of their vocation and office, they were called
by that name. And because they were true figures of y• verie
anointed of the Lord, which is the verie sonne of God, which
was annointed by the holie Ghost, which was giuen to him
without measure aboue all other men. And therefore Christ is
named with that name, as well because of the same vnction, as
because that all those. Offices were enioined to him by the father.

Christ, which doe attribute and ascribe vnto themselues, or
to their owne inuentions, that thing which onelie ought to bée
ascribed vnto Christ.

                  ¶This place hath bene diuerslie expounded, being restrained
of some to Iudas of Galilee, and to such like, but Christ generallie
compareth all false doctrines with the Gospell, and all
false Prophets with godlie Teachers, &c. For to come before
Christ in this place, is not to goe before Christ in time, but to
teach other doctrine beside the doctrine of Christ. Moses was
before Christ, the Prophets also were before Christ, but they
taught the church of the Lord by the spirite of Christ, and preached
Christ plainlie, though he laie hid vnder shadows & tipes.
For Peter saith, that the spirite of Christ was in them, also hée
saith that the holie men of God spake, being inspired with the
spirit of Christ, wherefore they are with true Pastours, because
they enter into the church by the word of the Lord, and
fedde the people of God in the Pastures of Christ, &c. All the
teachers of humane Traditions, and the carnall interpreters
of the Law, are théeues and murtherers, for with their pestilent
doctrine, they murther soules. For they which beleeue
lies, doe perish together with the lies which they beléeue.

armes, so is he now in the Priests hands. ¶Erue it is, that
Christ was there, & Christ is héere, but not in one or like manner
of being. For he was in the stall by bodilie presence: vpon
the holie Table, he is by waie of a Sacrament. The woman
in hir armes, helde him reallie: the Priest in his hands holdeth
him in a mysterie. So saith Saint Paule; Christ dwelleth
in our hearts, and no doubt the same Christ that laie in the
Stall. It is one and the same Christ, but the difference standdeth
in the manner of his beeing there: For in the stall he laie
by presence of his bodie, in our hearts he heth by presence of
faith.

                  How Christ is God, by these prooues
following.
                  
                     First almightie God said,Gen. 1. 26. let vs make man in our owne Image,
and after our likenesse. Which words (no doubt) doe
signifie vnto vs the Triplicitie of the persons in the Godhead,
which are thrée distinct in name and office, the Father, the
Sonne, and holie Ghost. And yet but one God.
                  The same thing also is more plainlie opened vnto vs in
the 18.1 Profe. of Genesis, where it is written that the Lord appeared
vnto Abraham as he sate in the Tent dore, for he lifte vp his
eies and sawe three men, which ranne to méete them, and fell
to the ground and said,God. Lord I beséech thée if I haue found fauour
in thy sight, goe not I praie thée from thy seruant, &c.
                  Héere he sawe thrée to make vs vnderstand (as I said before)
the pluralitie of persons. And yet he honoured but one, and
therefore said, Lord I beséech thee depart not from me. And to
signifie vnto vs the vnitie of the Godhead. And therefore not
without cause S. Iohn saith: There are thrée that beare witnesse
in heauen, the Father, the Word, and the holie Ghost, &
these thrée are one, wherefore it must néedes be graunted, that
Christ is God.
                  Christ saith also,2. Profe. Or Abraham was borne, I am. Which
words (I am) declare vnto vs his Godhead, for it is onelie the
name of God, as he himselfe said when he sent Moses vnto the
children of Israel in Aegypt saieng, thou shalt saie thus, vnto
them, I am, hath sent me vnto you. Ergo Christ is God.
                  Christ said vnto his disciples,3. Profe. Goe your waie and teach all
Nations, baptising them in the name of the Father, of the
Sonne and of the holie Ghost. But yet it is not lawfull to
baptise in the name of anie creature, but onelie in the name of
God, and we are commaunded to baptise in the name of Iesus
Christ. Ergo Christ is God.
                  S. Iohn saith.4. Profe. In the beginning was the Word, and the
Word was with God, and God was the Word, which Word
also became flesh, and dwelt among vs, by which words it is
euident, that he is God, and that from the beginning.
                  None hath power to make and create all things,5. Profe. but onelie
God, but Christ hath made and created all things as saith
Paule, both in heauen and in earth, visible and inuisible, and S.
Iohn saith, the world was made by him, and the world knew
him not. Ergo Christ is God.
                  
                     Whatsoeuer is without beginning is God:6. Profe. Christ is without
beginning, Ergo Christ is God. But now to proue the Minor,
that Christ is without beginning, it is written that in the
beginning God created heauen and earth, and so made y• world,
and all that are therein, and this was done in the beginning.
But Christ was before the world was, as he himselfe affirmeth,
saieng: Glorifie me then Father, with thine owne selfe, with
the glorie which I had: with thée or euer the world was. Ergo
Christ is God.
                  Saint Iohn saith,7. Profe. We knowe that the Sonne of God is
come, and hath giuen vs aminde to knowe him which is true,
& we are in him which is true, through his sonne Iesus Christ,
the same is verie God, and eternall life. 1. Iohn. 5. 20. A more
euident place of scripture cannot be, which affirmeth not that
Christ was God by his Office, as was Moses, but the true and
verie God, and also eternall life.
                  S. Paule also affirmeth that Christ came of the Israelites,
                     8. Profe.
which is God ouer all things, blessed for euermore. And Thomas
said vnto Christ, My Lord and my God. In all which places
he is called as he is indéed God.
                  It is written,9. Profe. thou shalt honour the Lord thy God, and him
onelie shalt thou serue. And yet S. Paule saith, that in the name
of Iesus Christ shall euerie knée boow, both of things in heauen
and things in earth, and things vnder the earth. By which sentence
we see, that godlie honour is due vnto him also, wherefore
it must néedes be graunted that he is God.
                  
                     Esay also prophecieng of Christ saith,10. Profe. that vnto vs a childe
is borne, and vnto vs a sonne is giuen, vppon his shoulders
shall his Kingdome lie, and he is called with his owne
name, wonderfull, the giuer of counsell, the mightie GOD,
the euerlasting Father, the Prince of Peace. And Paule
in like manner out of the Psalmes of Dauid saith: He maketh
his Angels spirits, and his ministers flames of fire. But
vnto the Sonne he saith: God, thy seate shall be for euer & euer.
In which places we sée he is called God, yea, and that the mightie
God.

his bodie) and I will reare it vp in thrée daies. And againe, I
haue power to put my life from me, and haue power to take
it againe. Wherefore it must néedes be graunted, that Christ
is God.
                  Christ saith,13. Profe. All that the Father hath are mine. The Father
hath the Diuine nature and Godhead in him, Ergo Christ
hath the same, and so he is God. For saith Paule, in him dwelleth
all the fulnesse of the Godhead bodilie, & we are complete
in him, which is the head of all rule and power.
                  All things that the Father doeth,14. Profe. the same doe I saith
Christ, for the Father giueth eternall life, to as manie as beléeue
in him, and so doth Christ. Wherefore séeing that the
Father and the Sonne haue all one action, néedes must it followe
then, that they be of one nature, and so is one God with
him, as he himselfe affirmeth, saieng: The Father and I are
one, & teacheth vs also to beléeue, that the Father is in him, and
he in the Father.
               
               
                  Certaine of the Arrians Obiections that Christ is
not God, aunswered.
Obiection.
                  THe Father saith Christ,1. Obiect. is greater then I. Christ ye sée in
this place hath graunted himselfe to be infexiour vnto the
Father, wherefore it cannot be said, that he is all one God
equall with him.
               
               
                  Aunswere.
                  Forasmuch as there are two natures in Christ, the nature
of God and man, as is before sufficientlie proued, I aunswere
that by his diuine nature, he is God equall, and all one
with the Father, as he himselfe said, I and the Father are one.

But as touching his humaine nature he was lesse then the father.
And therefore he said, the Father is greater then I. But
how y• this Scripture ought thus to be vnderstood, we shall sée
that Saint Paule will declare the selfe same thing in effect in
one sentence.ii. Natures in Christ. Iesus Christ saith he, when he was in the shape
of God, thought it no robberie to bée equall with God, neuerthelesse
he made himselfe of no reputation, taking on him the
shape of a seruant, and was found in his apparel as a man, &c.
Héere we sée that forasmuch as he was in the shape of God, he
was equall with God, and inasmuch as he was in the shape of
man, he was lesse then the father, for he made himself of no reputation.
Thus ye doe sée the sentence they bring foorth is verie
true, and yet maketh nothing for that purpose they alleadge
it. But if they list to cauill about this word shape or likenesse
of God, therefore he was not God, for it is one thing to be in
the shape and likenesse of GOD, and another to bée GOD.
To that I aunswere, that as he saith, he was in the shape
of GOD, so he saith also that he tooke on him the shape of a seruant,
and was found as a man. And if they will prooue him
heereby not to bée God, so on the other side I will proue him
not to be man, because he tooke on him the shape of a seruant,
and was found as a man, and the one is euen as true as the
other, which if it shuld bée graunted, the whole work of our saluation
should be of none effect. Thus do you sée of what force
this argument of theirs is.
               
               
                  Obiection.
                  Christ saith all power is giuen vnto me in heauen & earth.2. Obiect.
And againe, the Father loueth the sonne, & hath giuen al things
into his hand. Thus sée we the Father giueth, and the sonne
receiueth, and greater is he that giueth, then he that receiueth,
wherefore it cannot be, that he should be equall, and all one
God with the Father.
               
               
                  Aunswere.
                  This obiection maie be answered like as the other, ye Christ
was equall with his Father as touching his diuinitie, & lesse
then the Father as concerning his humanitie. In the which
humanitie he receiued all things of his Father, but as touching
his diuinitie, he created and made all thinges, and giueth
the selfe same gifts to men that the Father giueth. For Saint

                     Iohn saith: the world was made by him, and as manie as receiued
him, to them gaue he power to bée the sonnes of God.
Thus sée we the Scripture which they alleadge, serueth nothing
for their purpose.
               
               
                  Obiection.
                  S. Paule. 1. Cor. 15. 25. saith:3. Obiect. Then commeth the end, when
Christ hath deliuered vp the kingdome to God the Father, whē
he hath put downe all rule, all authoritie and power. For hée
must reigne vntill he put all his enimies vnder his feet. For
as much then as Christ shall deliuer vp his kingdome to God
the Father, and shall reigne vntill he put all his enimies vnder
his feete, néeds it must be graunted that his kingdome shall
haue an end, whereby it is euident that he is not God.
               
               
                  Aunswere.
                  The kingdome of Christ doth consist in conquering our auncient
enimie the diuell, vnder whom we were a long time in
bondage, & in that he should die to redeeme the people, and so
together in one, and so to ascend vp on high, and to leade awaie
captiuitie captiue, to sit on the right hand of God, to make intercession
for vs, and last of all to sit in iudgement on all flesh,
whereof part is alreadie done, and the other part is a dooing, &
part to be done. For first y• redemption of man is alreadie done
and wrought by his death and passion. Againe, euen vnto this
daie, he fighteth in his members against Satan the enimie of
God, and reigneth as a king in the heartes of them that be his,
beside this, he continuallie maketh intercession for vs. And
the last daie, he shall as a righteous Iudge, reward them that
be his, with eternall lyfe, but the vngodlie with death euerlasting.
All the which béeing done, this kingdome of his shall
cease. For he shall deliuer it vp vnto his Father, & so haue an
end. For it shalbe no longer néedfull, forasmuch as the saluation
of man, shall there vs altogether finished and made perfect.
But doth it nowe followe, that although this kingdome
of his shall haue an end, that then he shall cease to reigne, and
haue no kingdome? By the selfe same reason maie it bée proned,
that God the Father was without a kingdome, all the
while y• this kingdōe of Christ hath continued, for Christ saith:
All power is giuen me of my Father. Héere ye sée that the

Father gaue all power and authoritie vnto Christ, Ergo the
Father was without power and authoritie for the time that
Christ had it. The which I am well assured, that no man
that is in his right minde will bée content to graunt.
                  And beside all this,Luk. 1. 3
                           •
                        
                      we haue the plaine testimonie of Scripture,
that the kingdome of Christ is euerlasting. For the Angell
said, Of his Kingdome there shall bée no ende. Thus if the
Scripture be well weied, it maketh nothing at all for their
purpose.

is righteous, and iustifieth God in the lawe. For he affirmeth

that God is righteous and iust, which is the author of the law.
He beléeueth the promises of God, and iustifieth God, iudgeing
him true, and beleeuing that he will fulfill his promises. With
the lawe he condemneth himselfe and all his déedes, and giueth
all the praise to God. He beléeueth the promises, and ascribeth
all truth vnto God, thus euerie where iustifieth he God, & praiseth
God.

                  After the Popes Catholike religion, a true Christen man
is thus defined: First to be baptised in the Latine tongue,
(where the Godfathers professe they cannot tell what.) Then
confirmed by the Bishop: the mother of the childe to be purified.
After he be growne in yeares, then to come to the Church,
to kéepe his fasting daies, to fast the Lent, to come vnder Benedicite,
that is, to be confessed to the Priest, to do his penance.
At Caster to take his rightes, to heare Masse & diuine seruice,
to set vp candles before Images, to creepe to the Crosse, to take
holie bread and holie water, to go on Procession, to carrie his
Palmes and Candles, and to take Ashes, to fast the Imberdaies
and vigils, to kéepe his holie daies, and to paie his tiths
and offering daies, to go on pilgrimage, to buie pardons, to worship
his maker ouer the Priests head, to receiue the Pope for
his supreame head, and to obeie his lawes, to receiue S. Nicholas
Clarkes, to haue his beads, and to giue to the high Altar,
to take orders if he will be a Priest, to saie his Mattins,
to sing his Masse, to lift vp faire, to kéepe his vowe, and not to

                  How the Christian maie warrant himselfe the
forgiuenesse of his sinnes.
                  Saint Hilarie in his 5. Canon vpon Mathew saith:S. Hilarie It is
Gods will that we should hope without anie doubting of his
vnknowne will for if the beliefe be doubtfull, there can be no
righteousnesse obteined by beleeuing. And thus we see that according
to S. Hilarie, a man obteineth not forgiuenesse of
his sinnes at Gods hand, except he beléeue vndoubtedly to obteine
it. And good right it is it shuld be so. For he that doubteth
is like a waue of the sea, which is tossed & turmoiled with the
winde. And therefore let not such a one thinke to obteine
anie thing at Gods hand.
                  Let such foolish imaginations (saith Saint Austen) murmure
as much as it listeth, saieng:S. Austen. Who are they? How great
is that glorie? By what desert hopest thou to obteine it? I answere
assuredlie: I know in whom I haue beléeued, & I know
that he (of his great goodnes) hath made me his sonne, I know
he is true of his promise, and able to performe his word: for he
can doe what he will. And when I thinke vppon the Lordes
death, the multitude of my sinnes cannot dismaie me, for in his
death doe I put all my trust. His death is my whole desart, it
is my refuge it is my saluation, my life and resurrection, & the
mercie of the Lorde is my desart, I am not poore of desart, so
long as the Lord of mercie faileth me not. And sith the mercies
of the Lord are manie, manie are also my deseruinges. The
more he is of power to saue, the more am I sure to bée saued.
                  The same Saint Austen talking with God in an other
place saith, that he had dispaired by reason of his great sinnes,
and infinit negligences, if the worde of God had not become
flesh. And anone after he saith these wordes. All my hope, all
the assuraunce of my trust, is setteled in his precious bloud,
which was shed for vs, and for our saluation. In him my poore
heart taketh breath, & putting my whole trust in him, I long
to come vnto thée O Father, not hauing mine owne righteousnesse,
but the righteousnesse of thy sonne Iesus Christ. In
these two places S. Austen sheweth plainlie, that the Christian
must not be afraide, but assure himselfe of righteousnesse

by grounding himselfe, not vpon his owne workes, but vppon
the precious bloud of Iesus Christ, which cleanseth vs from
all our sinnes, and maketh our peace with God.
                  S. Barnard in his first sermon vpon the Annuntiation saith
most euidentlie,S. Barnard ye it is not inough to beléeue that a man can
haue forgiuenesse of his sinnes, but by Gods mercie, nor anie
one good desire or abilitie to doe so much as one good worke,
except God giue it him: no, nor that a man can deserue eternall
life by his workes, but if God giue him the gift to beléeue.
But beside all these things (saith Saint Barnard) which
ought rather to be counted a certeine enteraunce and foundation
of our faith. It is néedfull that thou beleeue also, that thy
sinnes are forgiuen thée, for the loue of Iesus Christ, &c.
               
            
            
               CHVRCH.
               
                  What a Church, or the Church is.
                  To the seauen ChurchesApoc. 1. 4. ¶A Church is properlie
a Companie or Congregation of Christen folkes, redéemed
by the bloud of Christ, which suffer themselues to be ruled by
Gods word, and are alwaies in this world mingled with the
vngodlie & vnbeléeuers, & therefore being knowne onelie vnto
God. They be preserued vnder the protection of Christ their
Shepheard, that they maie not perish with this world. Therfore
wheresoeuer we sée Gods word sincerely preached & heard,
and the Sacraments ministred according to Christs institution,
it is not to be doubted but ther is some church of God considering
that his promise cannot deceiue, which is: Wheresoeeuer
two or thrée be gathered together in my name,Mat. 18. 20 there am
I in the middest of them.
Marl. fol. 7.
                  
                  If we take the Church in generall, it signifieth assembly or
companie. But when we speake of the Church of God, wée
take it not onelie for the assemblie and companie of all sorts of
people, but for a companie and assemblie of men, the which
God hath chosen from others, & hath consecrated and sanctified
them vnto himselfe in his sonne Iesus Christ by his holie spirit,
for this cause she is called holie, & the co
                        •••
                     union of saints,
& they be all the true faithfull, which by faith are made members
of Iesus Christ, which is the holie one of holinesse, the
which hath giuen his holie spirit to his Church to sanctifie it.

And therefore S. Paule doth call all Christians saints.

vnitie of faith, hauing the holie Ghost within them to sanctifie
their spirits, which doth set their trust onlie in the redemption
promised thē in Christs blessed bloud, & this church by Christ
is made without spot or wrinkle.

downe of ye same, is the name of God praised. So is the church

                  On this consideration (saith Saint Austen) the Church is
holy and Catholike,Holie. not because it dependeth on Rome, or anie

                     Cipriane the Bishop and Martyr in his booke De simplicitate
Clericorum saith: The Church is one which is spread further
and further abrode by fertile increase: euen as there are
manie heames of the Sunne and but one light, and manie
boughes of a tree, yet but one Oke grounded vpon a stedfast
roote: And where as manie brookes issue out of one spring,
though the number séeme to be increased by the abundaunce of
store, yet it is but one at the head. Plucke a beame of the Sun
from the Gloabe, that one once separated is voide of
light: Breake a bough from the Tree it can bring foorth
no fruite. Cutte a Brooke from the Springe, and béeing
cutte of, it drieth vp. Guen so the Church lightened with
Gods light, which is spread euerie where, neither is the vnitie

of the bodie seperated, she extendeth hot braunches with
plenteous increase throughout all the earth, she sendeth out her

wherefore she hath spottes and wrinkles, but by knowing of
them, her wrinkles are stretched out, & knowledging, her spots
be washed awaie. The Church continueth in praier, that shée
might be cleansed by knowledging of her sinnes, and as long
as we héere liue, so standeth it. And when euerie man departeth
out of this bodie, all such sinnes are forgiuen him,Spots and wrinkles, which
ought to be forgiuen him. For they be forgiuen by dailie praier,
and he goeth hence cleansed. And the Church of God is
laide vp in the treasure of God for golde, and by this meanes
the Church of God is the treasure of our Lord without spotte
or wrinkle. Sequitur. Let vs praie that God maie forgiue vs,
and that we maie forgiue our debters, séeing it is said, And it
shall be forgiuen vnto you. Wee saie this dailie, and dailye
we doe this, and this thing is done dailie in vs. We are not
héere without sinne, but we shall depart without sinne.

                  How it is said aright that the Church cannot erre.
                  The Church is the pillor and foundation of the truth,1. Tim. 3. 15. how
then can it erre? Wée aunswere brieflie (saith Musculus) wée
doe knowe right well, that the Church is the onelie and welbeloued
spouse of Christ, the kingdome of heauen, ye it is ruled
by the masterie and leading of the holie spirit, and that wée bée
alwaies taught by his anoninting, and that it is the piller and

foundation of the truth. But these saiengs do perteine not vnto
all particuler Churches, but vnto that onelie vpright and
catholike church, which is the communion of the Saints and
elect throughout all the worlde, which doth beléeue in Christ
their Lord and spouse, in all ages. And touching this ther is no
variaunce, there is none of vs that saie, that the catholike
church hath erred in the faith of Christ. For how can it erre
when it followeth Christ, and walketh not in darknesse, but
hath the light of life? Christ hath not forsaken it, nor neuer
will forsake it, all our whole strife is vpon the particular churches,
which be mingled with good and euill together. They not
onelie can erre, but also haue erred, and doe erre yet in manie
points, &c.

                  Saint Augustine in his preface vpon the 47. Psalme alleadgeth
this place of the Apostle in this wise.Augustin Therefore wée
must vnderstād by the second of the sabboth, none but ye church
of Christ, but the church of Christ in his Saintes, the church
of Christ in them which be written in heauen, the church of
Christ in them which doe not yéelde vnto temptations of this
world, for they be worthie to beare the name of ye firmament.
Therefore the church in them which be strong (of whom the
Apostle saith, Wée which be strong beare with the infirmities
of the weake) is called the firmament: whereof it is song in the
Psalme: Let vs heare, let vs knowe, let vs sound, let vs glorie,
let vs reigne. For heare you and knowe, that the same also
is called the firmament by the writing of the Apostle: which is
(saith he) the church of the liuing God, the piller and firmament
of truth. Thus saith Augustine.
                  
                  
                     Chrisostome doth expound this place in this sort. Not as ye
Iewish church: for this is that which conteineth the faith (that
is to saie; the piller and establishment of the church) and ye preaching.
For truth is the piller and establishment of the church,
this saith he. He maketh not the church to be the piller & establishment
of the truth, but ye truth of ye church, &c.

                  Whereas the word of God is purelie and sincerely preached,
& the Sacraments orderlie ministred after the blessed ordinance
of Christ. And wheras men do patiently suffer for the
veritie. And the hearers doe applie their liuing to Christ doctrine,
and with méeknesse receiue the holie Sacraments, these
be good and present tokens to iudge vpon, that there be certeine
members of Christs church, and to proue this, read the doctors
following.
                  Our mother holie church (faith Augustine) throughout all
the world scattered farre and wide in her true head Christ
taught,Augustin hath learned not to feare ye contumelies of the crosse,
nor yet of death, but more and more is she strengthened, not in
resisting, but in suffering.

haue obteined into the church, there can be no true probation
of christendome nor no other refuge vnto christen men, willing
to knowe the veritie of faith, but by the Scriptures of
God. Afore by manie waies was it shewed, which was the
church of Christ, and which was the congregation of the Gentiles.
But now there is none other waie to them ye will know,
which is the verie true church of Christ, but onely by Scriptures.
By works first was the church of Christ knowne, when
the congregation of christen men, either of all or of manie were
holie, the which holinesse had not the wicked men.Mountaines. But nowe
christen men are as euill or worse then heretiks or Gentiles:
yea, & greater continence is found among them, then among
christen men. Wherefore he ye will knowe which is the verie
church of Christ, how shal he know but by ye scriptures only?
And therefore our Lord considering that the great confusion of
things should come in the latter daies, for that cause cōmaunded
he that christen men willing to reserue the stablenesse of
the true faith, shuld flée vnto none other thing, but vnto ye scriptures.
For if they haue respect vnto other things, they shall bée
slaūdred & shal perish, not vnderstāding which is ye true church.

                      It can no waie bée knowne,
what is the Church, but onelie by the Scriptures. Againe,
Christ commaundeth,Homi. 49. that who so will haue the assuraunce
of true faith, séeke to nothing else but vnto the Scriptures.
Otherwise if they looke to anie thing else, they shall be offended,
and shall perish, not vnderstanding which is the true
Church, and by meanes héereof, they shall fall into the abhomination
of desolation, which standeth in the holie places of
the Church.
                  There bée certeine bookes of our Lord,Augustin vnto the authoritie
whereof each part agréeth: there let vs séeke for the church:
Thereby let vs examine and trie our matter. Againe, hée

our Lord Iesus Christ? In my iudgement we ought rather
to séeke the Church in his words, for that he is the truth, and

waies to knowe the church of Christ,Chrisostome. that is to saie, by good
lyfe, by myracles, by chastitie, by doctrine, by ministring the
Sacraments But from that time heresies did take holde of
the church, it is onelie knowne by the Scriptures which is the
true church. They haue all things in outward shew, which
the true church hath in truth. They haue Temples like vnto
ours, &c. Wherefore onely by the Scriptures doe we knowe
which is the true church.

euerie part in his proportion, it maketh vp the increase of the

wiues be subiect vnto your own husbands, as to the Lord. For
the husband is the wiues head, euen as Christ is also the head

                  Albeit that Paule doe call the spouse of Christ vnspotted

and not beraied with anie wrinkles or moules? Yet doth it
not followe that the faithfull sinne not, as ye vnskilfull Anabaptists
chatter. For then had Iohn bene a liar in writing,
If we saie we haue no sinne we deceiue our selues, and the
truth is not in vs. 1. Iohn. 1. 8. And where as the same Iohn

is vnblameable: The cause is this, that although the godlie
and the faithfull be sinners, and do dailie offend, yet notwithstanding,
their peace maker and bridegrome Iesus Christ,
laieth not their sinnes to their charge by reason of their wedding
garment, that is to saie, of their beliefe in him. Wherefore
those that by this and such other like places doe gather
with ye

                  How the Church receiued not her first preaching
of the Gospell from Rome.
                  
                     Eusebius fol. 28. saith, that Saint Marke the Euangelist
first erected congregations and taught the Gospell at Alexandria.
                     Not from Rome.
                  
                  
                     Nicephorus saith, that S. Marke went preaching ouer all
Aegypt, Libia, and Sireni, and Pentapolis, & the whole countrie
of Barbarie, in the time of the Emperour Tiberius, which
was at the least sixe yeares before Peter came to Rome.
Therefore it cannot be true that the Church receiued from
Rome, the first preaching of the Gospell.
               
               
                  How the Church is hidden.
                  In Helias time the Church was not knowne vnto men,
but vnto God onelie, for else Helias would not haue said, that
he ws left alone. And this is plaine inough by that which
the text hath, namelie that God saith, Reliqui mihi, I haue
reserued to me. 7000. Marke that he saith, God hath reserued
to himselfe,Hidden. to his owne knowledge, as I doubt not, but
an hundred yeares agoe, God had his. 7000. in his proper
places, though men knew not thereof.

in calmenesse of time appeareth quiet & frée: Somtime

is hidden and troubled with waues of tribulations and temtations.
He bringeth foorth examples that oftentimes the strongest

or were hidden in the world.

we shall from time to time, sée the church. But we ought to
beléeue from time to time, that there is an holie church. Scripture
saith: Thou art verilie a hidden God. So the church is
oftentimes hidden. The husband of an hidden condition, and
the spouse of an hidden condition. Christ was in the middest of

                     Ergo is the Church aboue the word of God? This argument
is not good. No more then if you would say: Iohn Baptist
doth shew Christs cōming to ye people, Ergo Iohn Baptist
is aboue Christ. Or as if I should shew the king to one who
knew him not, and tell him this is he, by and by you shoulde

                  I would giue no credence (saith S. Austen) vnto the gospell,
if the authoritie of the catholike church did not moue me.
¶Gerson the chauncellour of Paris, a right excellent famous
man in his time, doth in his second booke, De vita spirituali,
like a discrete, profound, learned clarke saie, that Saint Austen
in this place taketh the Church for the primitiue congregation
of those faithfull christen men,Saint Austen moued to beleeue. that heard and sawe
Christ, and were his record bearers. For when ther crept out
diuerse sundrie Gospels in the church, while the Apostles and
Disciples of Christ were yet liuing, they that had séene Christ
himselfe, and had heard his Apostles, could testifie which were
right and true, and which were not.
                  Saint Austen before he was conuerted was an heathen
man, and a Philosopher, full of worldlie wisdome, vnto whom
the preaching of Christ is foolishnesse, saith S. Paule. 1. Cor.
1. 18. And he disputed with blinde reasons of worldlie wisdome
against the christen. Neuerthelesse the earnest liuing of the
christians according to their doctrine, and the constant suffering
of persecution and aduersitie for their doctrine sake, moued
him and stirred him to beléeue, that it was no vaine doctrine,
but that it must néeds be of God, in ye it had such power
with it. For it happeneth that they which will not heare the
word at beginning, are afterward moued by the holie conuersation
of them ye beléeue, &c. Read.

Mother. As all men naturallie haue Adam for their father,
& Eue for their mother, so all spirituall men haue Christ
for their Father, and the church for their mother. And as Eue
was taken out of Adams side, so was the church taken out of
Christs side, whereout flowed bloud, for the satisfaction and
purging of our sinnes.August. li. 4. de sin. cap. 10. in Epist. post Col. contra donat

                  He shall not haue God to be his Father, which acknowledgeth
not the church to be his Mother. Moreouer, without the
church (saith Saint Austen) be the life neuer so well spent, it
shall not inherit ye kingdome of heauen. ¶This is not ment of

the Popish Church, but of the holie, catholike, or vniuersall
Church, which is the communion of Saints, the house of God,
the citie of God, the spouse of Christ, the piller and staie of the
truth: out of this Church there is no saluation indeede.

                     Visible that setteth
hir foorth commonlie, and therfore to see hir, we must put on such
eies as good men put on to see Christ, when he walked heere on

               CIRCVMCISION.
               
                  What circumcision doth represent.
                  
                     CIrcumcission representeth the promises of God to Abraham
on the one side, and that Abraham and his séede should circumcise
and cut of the lusts of their flesh on the other side, to
walke in the waies of the Lord.
Tindale. fo. 6.
                  
                  There be two Circumcisions, the one outward, made in the
flesh by mens hands, cutting awaie a round péece of the skinne
of the secret members. And this Circumcision was not necessarie
to saluation,ii. Circumcisions after the Gospell was openlie preached after
Christs passion, but was abrogated and left as indifferent and
not necessarie to saluation. The other Circumcision was the inward
Circumcision by y• spirit of God, by y• which y• whole bodie
is mortified & put away cléerelie by the spirit & by faith in
Christ. And this Circumcision is necessarie to saluation.
L. Ridley.
                  
                  Circumcision is nothing of it self, it signifieth y• blessed séede, in
which al nations are blessed. And it signifieth y• circumcision of
the hart, which consisteth in y• spirit, & not in y• flesh.
D. Heynes.
                  
                  The Nazares did contend, no Nation to appertaine to the
Church of God, vnlesse they were circumcised. Paule & Barnabas
said, that all as well Gentiles as Iewes, if they beléeue in
Christ, should be saued without circumcision.
D. Heynes.
                  
                  Circumcision was the holie action, whereby the flesh of the
fore-skinne was cut awaie for a signe of the couenaunt that
God made with men. Or to describe it more largelie, Circumcision
was a marke in the priuie members of men, betokening
the eternall Couenaunt of God, and was ordeined by God himselfe,
to testifie his good will towards them that were circumcised,
to warne them of regeneration and cleannesse, and to make
difference betwixt the confederates of God and other people or
nations.

                  What was ment by Circumcision.
                  
                     Lactantius. lib. Insti. 4. chap. 17. saith thus: The meaning of
Circumcision was, that we should make bare our breasts, to
wit, that we shoulde liue with a simple and plaine dealing
heart, because that part of the bodie which is circumcised,
is partlie like to a heart, and is therefore part of the priuitie.
And the cause why GOD commaunded to make it bare,
was, that by that signe he might admonish vs, not to haue a couered
hart, y• is, that we should not couer within the secretes

of our conscience anie 
                        〈…〉
                      whereof we ought to be ashamed.
And this is the Circumcision of the heart, wherof the Prophets
speake, which God hath than 
                        〈…〉

                      the mortall flesh, to the
immortall soule. For the Lord being whole set, fullie minded,
according to his eternall goodnesse, to haue a cure for our life
and safegarde, did set repentaunce before our eies for vs to followe,

                        •
                     s a waie to bring vs therevnto. So that if we make bare
our hearts, that is, if by confession of our sinnes we satisfie the
Lord, we should obtaine pardon: which is denied to the proud,
and those that conceale their faults, by God, who beholdeth not
the face as man doth, but searcheth the secrets of the breast.

                  Why was Christ cirumcised, seeing he is exempted from the
number of sinners?Christ. This doth S. Paule expound to the Galathians. 4. 4.
where he saith: When the fulnesse of time was
come, God sent his sonne borne of a woman, made subiect to the
Lawe, that he might redeeme those that were vnder the Law.
Wherefore as he was borne for vs, so was he circumcised for
vs. Neither was it his will to abolish Circumcision before hée
had made his present Sacrifice vpon the Altar of the crosse: by
which doing he bare witnesse, that Circumcision was Sacrament
ordeined of God.

                  How the Iewes circumcise their children.
                  Whilest the Iewe circumcise the Infant,Ievves. there standeth one
by, with a little vessell full of earth or of dust, whereinto they
thrust the fores kinne being cut off, as though the Diuel séemed
by that meanes to haue his meate. For the Lord said vnto the
Serpent, euen straight waie at the beginning: vpon thy breast
shalt thou créepe, and earth shalt thou eate. They séeme to thinke
that the Diuell hauing thus gotten his meate, departeth from
the childe, and will not afterward trouble him anie more.

                  How the Aegyptians circumcise their
children.
                  The Aegyptians (saith Ambrose) circumcised not in the
eight daie,Aegyptians. as God had commaunded, but in the 14 yeare, for
that Ismael at that time receiued Circumcision, which manner
also it is most likelie the Arabians followed, for at this day, the
Turkes also are circumcised at that age. Although the Aegyptians
(as the same Ambrose affirmeth) were woont also to circumcise
their women kinde, and that in the 14. yeare as they
did their males. And of this thing they gaue this reason, that
they would by this signe signifie, that lust is to be restrained,
which in either kinde at that age, beginneth chiefelie to be kindeled.
But God commaunded, that onelie the male kinds shuld
be circumcised: and yet were not the women of the Hebrues,
counted either straungers from the Church, or from the Couenaunt:
for they are alwaies numbred together with the men:
they that were vnmarried with their Fathers, and the married
with their husbands, &c.

                  The people in the wildernesse ceased from Circumcision
notwithstanding it was commaunded.Iosua. 3. 5.

                  They had Gods speciall dispensation so to doe, for they were
in continuall trauaile from place to place, and could abide no labour
being newlie circumcised, but they made no lawe that circumcision
should be quite abolished.

                  How God did couer himselfe with cloudes,
when he spake to the people.
                  SUch is the vnspeakable power, & the high maiestie of God,
that like as Princes doe appeare and shew themselues in
goodlie. Tabernacles or houses and palaices richlie hanged and
princelie adourned, so the Cloudes serue vnto God to compasse
him about, when he speaketh vnto men. As the Prophet saith:
Posuit tenebras latibulum suum in circuitu eius,
                     Psa. 12. 11 
                     tabernaculum
eius tenebrosa aqua in nubibus aeris. He hath made darknesse
to be vnto him as it were a secret closet or priuie chamber, his
Tabernacle that compasseth him round about, is darke water &
thicke Cloudes of the aire. And to make this as plaine as can
be made to our dull senses, read the 19.Exo. 19. 18 of Exodus, and there shal
ye finde it written, that when God gaue the Lawe to the people
of Israel, he appeared to Moses vpon the top of Mount of Sinai,
in a thicke Cloud, compassed about with smoke and flames of
fire, by the which straunge sight, God declared his presence, and
also his power vnto the hard hearted people of the Iewes. Likewise
in the third booke of Kings the 8.
                        
                           •
                        . Re. 8. 10 Chapter, we read that after
the time king Salomon had builded the Temple, almightie
God to declare his presence to be readie to heare their praiers,
and to accept their Sacrifice made in that place, filled the Temple
at noone daie with a darke Cloud, so that the Priests could
not stand and minister because of the Cloude. Also in the new
Testament, ye shal read in the 17 of S. Mathew,

                           •
                        . 17. 3 y• when Christ
vouchsafed to giue to the Apostles a tast of his heauenlie glorie,
before he should goe to the suffering of his passion: to the ende
that they should more stronglie & constantlie abide in those bitter
stormes of temptation, when he should be spitted at, and reuiled
of the Iewes: our Sauiour did transfigure and chaunge
the state of his naturall bodie, into the cléerenesse & brightnesse
and gloriousnesse of his heauenlie bodie, that he should haue after
his Resurrection, in such wise y• his face did shine, as bright
as the Sunne, and his garments that he did weare vpon his bodie,
were as white as Snowe, and with him was seene Moses
and Helias talking with him, Et ecce nubes lucida obumbrauit

This is my beloued Sonne, for whose sake I am pleased and
pacified, toward all them that beléeue in him, and will hearken
vnto his doctrine, ipsum audite, heare him. Furthermore in the
first chapter of the Actes of the Apostles,Act. 1. 9 we read that a Cloud
compassed and closed in the bodie of our Sauiour Iesus, ascending
vp into heauen, and so tooke him out of the sight of the Apostles.
Thus by these manifest places of Scriptures conferred
together, ye see euidentlie the wordes of the Prophet put in
practise,Psa. 18. 11 when he saith: The Lorde hath made the darkenesse
his secret closet, and the Cloudes of the aire his Tabernacle,
to compasse him round about.

and Chariots.
                  The Cloudes and all the cope of heauen, are tearmed Gods
Pauilions or Tents. And diuers times it is said, that y• Clouds
are his Chariots namelie because he guideth them and maketh
them to goe forward, or els doth as it were walke vpon them
to make his triumphs. Thus you sée how God is presented vnto
vs as a Prince, in that he vseth the Heauens as his Palaice,
and his maiestie sheweth it selfe there. Againe, the Clouds are
as ye would saie, the pillers of his pauilion, to the end we shuld
be the more moued to consider the royall workmanship. Then
séeing it is so, let vs learne to yéeld God that which is his owne,
and let not his glorie be lefaced through our vnthankfulnesse.

               COMMAVNDEMENTS OF GOD.
               
                  How they be impossible for man to fulfill.

                      keepe the Commaundements.
¶Remember that when God commaundeth vs to do anie
thing, he doth it not therefore because that we of our selues can

doe that he commaundeth, but that by the Lawe we might sée
and know our horrible damnacion and captiuitie vnder sinne,
and therefore should repent and come to Christ & receiue mercie,
and the spirit of God to loose vs; strength vs, and to make
vs able to doe Gods will which is the Lawe. Now when he
saith, if thou wilt enter into life, kéepe the Commaundements,
is as much to saie, as, he that kéepeth the commaundements, is
entered into life. For except a man haue first the spirit of life
in him by Christs purchasing, it is impossible for him to kéepe
the commaundements, or that his heart should be loose or at
libertie to lust after them, for of nature we are enimies vnto
the lawe of God.

                  Obiection.
                  If our frée will (saith fleshlie reason) can doe no goodnesse,
what neede, God to commaund so manie good things, what néed
God to giue those Commaundements that he knoweth wel to
be impossible for vs, and if they be impossible, what right is in
him that damneth: vs for that thing that is impossible for vs to
doe?
               
               
                  Aunswere.
                  It is a great presumption to enquire a cause of our makers
will, or to murmure against his holie ordinaunce, which maie
not be chaunged. And if he do giue vs commandements which
be impossible for vs (by our owne naturall strength) to keepe:
he doth it, that we thereby might knowe our weaknes, & so to
séeke and call to him for helpe.Augustin As S. Austen declareth well in
these words, saieng: If a man doe perceiue that in the commaundements
is anie thing impossible, or els too hard: let him
not remaine in himselfe, but let him runne vnto God his helper,
the which hath giuen his commaundements to that intent,
that our desire might be stirred vp, & that he might giue helpe,
&c. ¶Héere we sée S. Austen saith, that the commandements
be impossible for our strength, but we must call to God for
strength.
D. Barnes.
                  
                  Whereas S. Augustine hath these saiengs: That God neither
could commaund things that were impossible,Augustin because he
is iust, nor would condemne man for that he could not auoide:
And that God would neuer condemne the slothfull seruaunt,
if he had commaunded that he coulde not atchieue: And also
that God who is iust and good, could neuer commaund things

that were impossible to be done: yet in his booke of refractions,
whereas he better aduising himselfe, writ on this wise: All the
commaundements (saith he) are accompted to be done, when
that is pardoned which is not done.

                  The Pelagians did recken that they had got a great victorie,Pelagians reason.
when they had made this carnall reason, that God would condemne
nothing that were impossible: of this reson did they glorie
and triumph, and thought they must néedes haue some naturall
strength and power to fulfill the Commanndements of
God, séeing that God would commaund nothing impossible to
man.
               
               
                  Aunswere.
                  The Pelagians (saith S. Austen) thinke that they knowe a
wonderfull thing, when they saie, God will not commaund
that thing, the which he knoweth is impossible for man to doe.
Euerie man knoweth this. But therfore doth he commaund certaine
things that we cannot doe, because we might know, what
thing we ought to aske of him. Faith is she that by praier obtaineth
that thing the Lawe commaundeth. Briefelie, he that
saith, if thou wilt thou maist kéepe my Commaundements, in
the same booke a little after saith: He shall giue me kéeping
in my mouth. Plaine it is that we maie keepe the Commaundements
if we will. But because our wil is prepared of God, of
him it must be asked, that he maie so much will, as will suffice
vs to doe them. Truth it is that we will when we will, but he
maketh vs to will, that thing which is good. ¶Heere S. Austen
saith, that the Commaundements of God, be impossible to our
naturall strength, and therefore be th

                     Augustin testifieth of his owne time: The Sacrament
(with he) of this thing, of the vnitie of the Lords bodie, is some
where dailie, some where by certaine distances of daies prepared
vpon the Lords Table, & is there receiued at the Table, to
some vnto life, to other some vnto destruction. And in y• first
Epistle to Ianna
                           •
                        i
                           •
                        s: some doe dailie communicate of ye bodie
& bloud of the Lord, some receiue it at certaine daies: in some
places, there is no daie lette passe, wherein it is not offered:

in some other places onlie vpon the Saterday and the Sunday.
And in some other places neuer but on the Sundaie. But forasmuch
as the common people was (as we haue said) somwhat
slacke, the holie men did call earnestly vpon them with sharpe
rebukings, least they should séeme to winke at such slothfulnesse.
Such an example is in Chrisostome vpon the Epistle to
the Ephesians. It is not said vnto him that dishonored the banket,
Wherefore didst thou sit downe? But, Wherefore didst
thou come in? Whosoeuer is not partaker of the mysteries, hée
is wicked and shamelesse, for that he standeth heere present. I
beséech you, if anie be called to a banket, washeth his handes, sitteth
down, séemeth to prepare himselfe to eate, and then doth tast
of nothing: shall he not shame both the banket and the maker
of the banket? So thou standing among them that with praier
doe prepare themselues to receiue the holie meate, hast euen in
this that thou hast not gone awaie, confessed that thou art one
of the number of them, at the least thou doest not partake: had

saie, I am vnworthie, therefore neither wast thou worthie of

portion of the holie bodie,Both kindes. doe abstaine from the Cup, let
them without doubt (because they séeme to be bound with I wot
not what supersticion,) either receiue the Sacraments whole:
for the deuiding of this mysterie is not committed without
great sacriledge.

                  Reasons made of the Catholikes to proue a Communion
in one kinde. Aunswered.
1. Reason.
                  Christ brake bread to his Disciples in Emaus,
                     One kind and vanished
out of their sight, before he tooke the Cup & blessed it. Of which
place they gather y• the communion was ministred in one kinde.
               
               
                  Aunswere.
                  S. Augustine, Gregorie, Iulianus, Dionisius, Lyra, Winford
with others, saie it was not the Sacrament, but the breaking

of bread, there was hospitalitie and enterteining of strangers.
Their words be these. First S. Augustine saith, because they
were giuen to hospitalitie, they knewe him in breaking of the
bread, whom they knewe not in the expounding of the Scriptures.
Gregorie saith, they laie the table and set foorth bread
and meate, and God, who they knewe not in the expounding
of the Scriptures, they knew in breaking of bread. Dionisius,
He tooke bread and blessed it, but he turned it not into his bodie,
as he did at his Supper, but onelie as the manner is, to
saie grace or to blesse the meate. Antonius Iulianus. He tooke
bread, blessed it, brake it, and gaue it to them, as his manner
was before his passion. Lyra saith: They knewe him, for that
he brake the bread so euen, as if it had bene cut with a knife.
Winford. It cannot be gathered (saith he) neither by the texte
of S. Luke, nor by the Glose, nor by the auntient Doctours,
that the bread that Christ brake after his resurrection, was
the consecrate or sacramentall bread, & therfore I sai
                        •
                     , that foolishlie
& by consequence, that falselie he alledgeth S. Augustin
to his purpose. Thus by these authorities it is proued not to be
the sacrament. In ye text ther is no mention made of consecration,
neither yet y• either Christ himself or the Apostles did eate
the bread.
               
               
                  2. Reason.
                  The breaking of bread, in the 27. of the Acts of the Apostles
by S. Paule, they affirme to be the Sacrament.
               
               
                  Aunswere.
                  If S. Paule gaue the Sacrament being at that time in perill
of shipwracke, he gaue it onelie to Infidels that knew not
Christ. And Chrisostome enlarging S. Pauls words, saith thus:
I praie you take some sustenaunce, it is behouefull that ye so
do, y• is to saie, take some meate, lest perhaps ye die for hunger.
               
               
                  3. Reason.
                  
                     Egesippus witnesseth of S. Iames, that he neuer drank wine,
but at our Lords Supper.
               
               
                  Aunswere.
                  S. Hierom saith, that S. Iames continued Bishop in Hierusalem,
the space of 30. yeares vntill the seauenth yeare of
Nero. If it then be true that Egesippus writeth of S. Iames that
he neuer dranke wine but at our Lords Supper, then it must
néeds follow, y• being bishop in Hierusalem ye space of 30. yeres,

he neuer said Masse, or els consecrated in one kinde, which thing
by Gelasius is counted Sacriledge.
               
               
                  4. Reason.
                  
                     Melciades Bishop of Rome ordeined that sundrie Hoasts
should be consecrated and sent abroad among the Churches &
Parishes, that Christen folkes should not be frauded of the holie
Sacrament, whereof they doe gather a Communion in one
kinde, because the wine could not be so conuenientlie caried.
               
               
                  Aunswere.
                  Whereas the maintainers of the Communion in one kind,
make so great a matter of the carieng of the wine, defrauding
the people of one kinde of Christs institution, marke this that
followeth. S. Hierom: writing of Exuperius Bishop of Tholouse
in Fraunce, saith thus: There was no man richer then he
that caried the Lords bodie in a wicker basket, and his bloud in
a glasse. Also Iust
                           •
                        us Martir declaring the order of his Church
in his tune, saith thus: Of the things that be consecrate (that is
the bread, water and wine) euerie man taketh part, the same
things are deliuered to the deacons to be caried vnto them, that
be awaie. Héere ye sée it was a common vsage in those daies, to
carie the Sacrament in both kindes.
               
               
                  5. Reason.
                  The Councell of Nice decréed, that in the Church where neither
Bishoppes nor Priests were present, the Deacons themselues,
bring foorth and eate the holie Communion, which cannot
be referred (saie they) to the forme of wine, for cause of sowring
and corruption if it be long kept.
               
               
                  Aunswere.
                  
                     Rufinus writeth in this sort: In the presence of the priests,
let not the Deacons deuide or minister the Sacrament, but onlie
serue the: Priests in their office. But if there be no Priest
present, then let it be lawfull for the Deacon to minister. Héere
is no mention made of these words: Let them bring it foorth
themselues and eate. Which wordes in verie déede, is neither
found in the Gréeke, nor in the decrees, nor in the former ediction
of the Councell, nor yet alledged by Gracian. Therefore the
meaning of the Counsell of Nice is, not that the Deacons shall
goe to the Pix, and take the Sacrament reserued, and eate it.
But in the absence of the Priest, they might consecrate the

holie mysteries, and deliuer the same vnto the people, as maie
be gathered by the words of Rufinus before rehearsed.
               
               
                  6. Reason.
                  Women receiued the Sacrament in a linnen cloth. Tertulians
wife receiued it at home before meate. S. Cipriane saith,
a woman kept it at home in a chest. These examples they alledge,
to proue that the people receiue the Sacrament in one
kinde and not in both.
               
               
                  Aunswere.
                  That women and other kept the Sacrament and caried it
about them, and that in both kindes, is manifestlie proued by
these. Authorities following. Gregorie Nazianzene writing
of his Sister Gorgonia, saith thus: If hir hand had laied
vp anie token of the pretious bodie and of the bloud mingling
it with hir teares, &c. Héere hée saith, shée had laied vp both
parts. Againe, Amphilochius saith, that a certeine Iewe
came and receiued among the faithfull, and priuelie caried
part of either home with him, how or wherein it is not written.
Truly, the thrée examples aboue rehearsed, are nothing els
but méere abuses of the Sacrament, and therefore as it appeareth
by Saint Cipriane, God shewed himselfe by myracle, to
be offended with it, fraieng the woman that so had kept it,
with a flame of fire. And it was decréed in the Councell holdon
at Cesarea Augusta in Spaine, that if a man receiued the
Sacrament, and eate not the same presentlie in the Church,
he should be accursed for euer.
               
               
                  7. Reason.
                  
                     Basil (saith Amphilochius) being once made Bishop, besought
God, that he might offen vp the vnbloudie Sacrifice with his
owne words: be fell in a traunce, came againe to himselfe, &
so ministred euerie daie. On a certaine night, Christ with his
Apostles came down to him from heauen,Amphilochius. brought bread with
him, awoke Basil, & had him vp and offer the Sacrifice. Up he
rose, was straight at the Altar, said his praiers as he had written
them in his paper, lifted vp the bread, laid it downe againe,
brake it in peeces, receiued one, reserued another to be buried
with him, hung vp the third in a golden Doue. And all this
was done, Christ & his Apostles being still present: who came
purposelie from heauen, to helpe Basil to Masse.
               
               
                  
                  Aunswere.
                  This storie is a méere fable put foorth vnder the name of
Amphilochius, as shal appeare by the circumstaunce & weighing
of the likelihood. Basile besought God that he might make
the sacrifice with his owne words. And shall we thinke he had
more fancie to his owne wordes then he had to the words of
Christ? He awoke, stoode vp, and sodeinlie was at the Altar at
midnight. What shall we thinke he was the Sextine there, or
laie all night like Elie & Samuel in the Church, and yet being
so famous a Bishop, had no man to tend vpon him. He diuided
the bread, and laide vp the third part of it in a golden Doue
that hang ouer the Altar, which Doue was not yet readie
made: For it followeth immediatly in the next lines: After
Basile had done th
                        •
                     se things, and had communed with Eubolius
and other mo, the next daie he sent for a golde-smith, & made
a Doue of pure golde. If this Doue were made before, howe
was it made afterwarde, and if it were not made afore, howe
could it hang ouer the Altar? or how could Basile put his bread
therein before it was made? and to what end was the bread so
kept in the Doue? and wherein or where was the other third
part kept, that Basile thus reserued purposelie to be buried with
him, which portion in the end of seuen years, he receiued in his
death bed. Now iudge what kinde of bread y• would haue ben,
after seuen yeares kéeping, to be giuen to a sick man. The true
Amphilochius was a godlie and worthie Bishoppe. But this
Amphilochius which wrote the storie of Thomas Becketts life,
700. yeares before he was borne, was a manifest and an impudent
lyar.

                  The third Chapter (saith he) is of the substance, forme, and
breaking of bread, which all doe well inough agrée with the institution
of Christ, whom it is manifest to haue vsed vnleuened
bread, and easie to be broken. For he brake it and gaue it
to his Disciples péeces of the bread broken. Touching ye forme
and figure, whether it were round or square, there is nothing
declared of the Euangelist. And because this bread is commonlie
vsed for a signe, not for corporall nourishment, I sée not
what can be reprehended in this description of the bread which
is in this book
                        •
                     , except some would peraduenture haue it thicker,

Papists.
                  AFter that a new religion was deuised, it was necessarie for
aide of the same to deuise new wordes: Whereas Christ
saith: This is my bodie, they saie, this is my bodie and my
bloud. Whereas Christ saith, This is my bloud, they saie, this
is my bloud and my bodie, and in either part they saie is whole
Christ, God and man. If ye demaund how they knowe it, they
saie, not by the word of God, but by this new imagination of
Concomitancia.
                  
               
            
            
               CONCORD.
               
                  A definition of concord.
                  COncord is a sure consent of mindes and wils in anie matter,
so that whatsoeuer God saith, to will the same, whose parent
and concernatrice similitude, as farre foorth as the nature
of thinges doe beare and suffer, bringeth all thinges to vnitie.
               
               
                  Who is the mother of concord.
                  Similitude by interpretation is called likenesse, and it is
named among learned men to be the mother of concord, because
that whereas men be of like faith, there is peace and vnitie, and
whereas they be not, there is strife and debate.
               
               
                  A praise of concord.
                  Salust, called (as I maie vse Saint Austens words) Historicus
veritatis, that is to saie, a writer of true stories, saith: that
by concorde, small substaunce doth increase. And againe, by
discorde, most greate riches will waste awaie and come to
naught.
                  
                     Publius a writer of merrie verses, neuerthelesse full of wise

The Psalmograph or the writer of Psalmes, commending concord
as a necessarie thing, saith: Behold how good and ioyfull a
thing it is, for brethren to dwell together in vnitie. And in the
last end of the Psalme it followeth, there hath the Lord promised

his blessing and life for euermore.

surelie bound together, none of them was able to breake

               CONCVBINE.
               
                  How a Concubine is taken in holie
Scripture.
                  A Concubine and an whoore (after the manner of our English
speach) is all one. For we in England do vnderstand by
a Concubine, a woman that is not married, & yet secretlie & vnlawfullie
keepeth companie with anie man, as though shée wer
his wife. But the Scripture doth not so take this word Concubine.
As by these examples. Abraham was a good man & yet he
had both a wife, & two concubines: For Sara was his obedient
& louing wife, & Agar & Ketura were his concubines, as it is
expreslie written in the 25. of Genesis on this wise. Abraham
beside Sara had an other wife called Ketura, by Agar he had onlie
one sonne, by Ketura he had sixe sonnes. Now when Abraham
died, he gaue his inheritaunce and his chiefe possessions to
Isaac: Filijs autem concubinarum largitus est munera. But
vnto the sonnes of his concubines Abraham gaue rewards and
legacies, and yet was Abraham no fornicatour, nor Agar neither
Ketura were no whoores. Also in the. 8. Chapter of Iudicum,
ye reade that Gedeon had 70. sonnes. Hée had one
named Abimelech, Natus de Concubina, whose name (as
Iosephus saith) was Droma.
                  
                  This Abimelech when his Father was dead, he laboured by

the helpe of his kinred by his mothers side to be made king.
And to the end he might atteine vnto the crowne, he slew. 69. of
his owne naturall brethren. Nowe marke, Gedeon was a
iust and a godlie man, high in Gods fauour, he therefore would
not, and againe hauing so manie wiues of his owne, he néeded
not to haue kept Droma which is called his concubine, as a
priuie whoore. Therefore it must be taken that Concubina is
not taken In malem partem, for an harlot and an whoore, but
euerie woman which is, Serua aut ancilla & a libero homine
ducta in vxorem concubina dicitur. For ye shall vnderstande
that in the olde time, bond men and bond women were counted
so vile, that they were neither taken nor vsed as men and
women be, but bought and solde as a bullocke or an horse is.
And if it so happened y• a bond man & a bond woman did marrie
together, it was not counted nor called matrimonie, but
Contubernium, a companie kéeping, as an horse and a mare, &
as a bull & a cow doth, & yet such companie kéeping, if it were
betwéene a man and a woman not prohibited by the law of God,
it were before him good and lawfull matrimonie, but by the
ciuil lawe of men, it were no matrimonie, because that ye children
begotten betwéene such a Father and such a mother, were
not in their power nor at the commaūdement of their parents,
but at their Lords commaundement. And if they and their parents
did get anie goods, the children should not inherit but the
Lord. And moreouer if a frée man did marrie a bond woman,
this lawfull wife should not be named a wife, but a concubine,
and her children should not inherit their Fathers landes, but
onelie receiue such moueable goods, as their Father would giue
them by his Testament. And after that sort did Abraham
deale with the sonnes of Agar and Kethura, which were no
whoores, but his lawfull wiues. Neuerthelesse, because they
were bond women before he married them, therfore they were
called his concubines. So likwise Salomon had 700. wiues,
that is. 700. Quéenes, which were frée women borne, and. 300
concubines, which were also his lawful wiues, but because they
were not frée women borne, therefore they are called concubines.

moneie was giuen vnto them,

               CONCVPISCENCE.
               
                  What concupiscence is.
                  COncupiscence is, that euil inclination and nature, which we
haue of the olde man,Gen. 
                           •
                        . 21. which draweth vs to euill as GOD
saith in Genesis. The imagination of mans heart is euill from
his youth.
                  Concupiscence is a motion or affection of the minde, which
of our corrupt nature doth lust against God and his lawe, and
stirreth vs vp to wickednesse, although the consent or déede it
selfe doth not presently followe vpon our conceit. For if the déed
doe followe the lust, then doth the sinne increase by steps and
degrées.

                  How concupiscence is sinne.
                  Against concupiscence of the flesh, Saint Paule is forced to
mourne and crie out on this wise: I sée an other lawe in my
members,Rom. 7. 23 24. 
                           •
                        
                      fighting against the lawe of my minde, and leading
mée prisoner vnto the lawe of sinne. And againe, O wretched
man that I am, who shall deliuer me from this bodie of
death.
                  Saint Ambrose
                     Ambrose. saith: Non inuenitur in vllo homine, &c.
There is not found in anie man such concord betwéene ye flesh
and the spirit, but that the lawe of concupiscence which is planted
in the members, fighting against the lawe of the minde.
And for that cause the words of Saint Iohn the Apostle are taken
as spoken in the person of all Saints: If we saie we haue
no sinne, we deceiue our selues, and the truth is not in
vs.
                  Saint Austen
                     Augustin saith also: Concupiscencia carnis, &c. The
concupiscence of the flesh, against which the good spirit lusteth,

is both sinne and the paine of sinne, and the cause of sinne. Againe
he saith
                        •
                      
                     Quamdiu viuis, &c. As long as thou liuest, there
must néeds be sinne in thy members.
                  One of the Popes principall doctors writeth thus: Augustinus
tradet hanc ipsam concupisentiam, &c. S. Augustine teacheth
vs that this same concupiscence planted in our bodie,Albertus Pighius in
them y• be not regenerate by baptime, verilie & in plaine manner
of speach, is sinne: and that the same concupiscence, is forgiuen
in baptime, but is not vtterly taken awaie.
                  Against Saint Paule and these holy Fathers. S. Ambrose
and Augustine, the late Counsell of Trident hath decréed thus:
Hanc concupiscentiam quam Apostolus, &c. The concupiscēce
which the Apostle Saint Paule sometime calleth sinne, this holie
counsell declareth that the catholike church neuer vnderderstood
it to be called sinne,Counsell of Tridēt for that it is so indéede, and in proper
name of speach in them that be baptised: but because it is
of sinne, and inclineth vs to sinne. And if anie man thinke the
contrarie, accursed be he. So that by this degrée S. Ambrose, S.
Austen, and other holie fathers, that haue written the same, are
all accursed.

endeuour with their owne strength to doe the penance that is
enioyned them: receiuing reuerently at Easter at the least, the
Sacrament of the Eucharist, vnlesse peraduenture by y• counsel
of their owne Priest, for some resonable cause, they thinke it
good for a time, to absteine from receiuing it: otherwise in this

vnrighteousnesse is not his. ¶S. Austen vpon this place hath a
verie prétie saieng: Marke (saith S. Austen) Quando homo detegit,
Deus tegitesi homo agnoscit, Deus igno scit. Whensoeuer
man discloseth his sinnes, then God doth close and shut it vp: If
man doe confesse his sinne. God doth forgiue his sinnes. Manie
men by this place of the Prophets haue gone about to
stablish secret confession, which some doe call auricular confession,
where the Prophet by his owne expressed words do declare
that he speaketh héere of the confession that a sorrowfull sinner
maketh to God, saieng: Delictum meum cognitum tibi feci. O
Lord, to thée haue I declared my sinne, and thou hast forgiuen it
me. This confession as S. Hilarie saith, is nothing els but a
continuall calling to remembraunce of our sinnes, with a true
repentant heart for the same. That man or woman doth onely
confesse themselues vnto God, which in his heart & in his spirit
béeing pricked and afflicted, doth vtterly detest and abhorre his
olde filthie life, defieth & d
                        •
                     nieth himselfe, hateth his owne dooings,
and doth wholie consecrate himselfe both bodie and soule
vnto God, doth care for nothing but to fashion his life, vnto the
will and pleasure of God, who so hath not this minde, this spirit
and this purpose, when he confesseth him vnto God, he is
but a mocker of God.

shall finde in thée: wilt thou not y• he shall condemne thée, condemne
thou thy selfe? Wilt thou haue him pardon thée, acknowledge
thou thy self, that thou maist saie vnto God: Turne away

be a curious kinde of men, that will séeke to knowe an other

For no man doth knowe what is done within man, but the

and gréeuous sinners, then they beginne to singe the swéete
song of the Signet, then they crie & confesse openly their sinnes,
their naughtie doings, their malice against their innocent brother.

confession was without Gods owne making from the beginning,
but onely deuised by good Fathers and godly Bishoppes,
for to bring the laye and vnlearned people, to the more feare
of GOD, and knowledge of their duetie vnto him, and to
their neighbour: And for the better performaunce of this their
purpose, they ordeined that hée that shoulde heare anie mans

woman of bloude, and faire of skinne and bone, which

by the Priest that had heard her confession, to resort dailie to
the Church for a certeine space, there to watch in fasting and
praier. This Priest intended well he thought that such an entera

                      insomuch Nectarius the Bishop deposed the
Deacon from ministrie, & for a quieting of the people, and stopping

of their months, commaunded confession to bée frée, and
at euerie mans libertie, whether he would be confessed or
no. Thus for a while confession was left, till within processe
of few yeares, carnall libertie and licentious liuing had
so much ouer whelmed the worlde, that the Fathers of the Occidentall
Church, for the greate loue they did beare vnto
the people, thought themselues bounde to restore confession againe,
but without anie scrupulus burden of impossible
enumeration of sinnes, without the opinion of dampnation,
to hang ouer their heads which had not bene confessed, but
tooke and vsed it as a meane to giue good counsell vnto the
ignorant people. Thus it continued manie years in the Occidentall
Church, whereby the people were brought to great amendement
of lyfe, by the true searching of their consciences,
and againe, to greate knowledge of God, through the godlye
counsell that was then giuen them by the learned Fathers,
and godlie Counsellers: manie men that were robbed and
wronged (by that meanes) had their goods and good name restored
to them againe. All this was done so long as the olde
Canon was obserued, that is, no man to heare confession, except
he had ye foure properties aforesaid, so long this discipline
was had in great estimation, and did much good. But after that
wicked Rome with dispensations, had in the stéed of learning
nourished ignoraunce, for diligence, slouth and idlenesse, for
wisdome and wise counsailers, lowtish lobbes and ignoraunt
dawes: In stéede of good counsaile and amendement of lyfe,
had clogged the consciences of men with enumeration of sins,
with manie moe like inconueniences, almightie God the louer
of truth, the spouse of his Church, hath stirred vppe in euerie
Realme learned men to inueigh against these abuses. So that
now we are left frée againe, euerie man to confesse or not to
confesse, as shall séeme to him good and most for his owne comfort.
Thus ye sée what beginning this secret or auricular confession
had, what increase, & at the last what decrease againe.

                     Sozomenus reporteth that this constitution of Bishops was
diligentlie kept in the west Churches,Trip. hist. li. 9. but speciallie at Rome:
Whereby he sheweth that it was no vniuersall ordinaunce of
all Churches. But he saith, that there was one of the Priestes

peculiarlie appointed to serue for this office. Whereby he doth
sufficientlie confute that which these men doe falsely say, of the
keies giuē for this vse vniuersallie to ye whole order of Priesthoode.
For it was not the common office of all Priests, but the
speciall dutie of some one that was chosen thervnto by the Bishop.
The same is he whom at this daie in all Cathedrall churches
they call Penitentiari, the examiner of hainous offences,
and such whereof the punishment perteineth to good example.
Then hée saith immediatlie after, y• this was also the manner
at Constantinople, till a certeine woman, faining y• shée came
to confession, was found so to haue couloured vnder that pretence,
the vnhonest companie that shée vsed with a certeine
Deacon. For this act, Nectarius a man notable in holinesse,
and learning, Bishoppe of that Church, tooke awaie that custome
of confessing. Héere let these asses lift vp their eares.
If auricular confession were the lawe of God, how durst Nectarius
repell and destroie it? Will they accuse for an heretike
and scismatike Nectarius a holie man of God, allowed by the
consenting voice of all the olde Fathers? But by the same
sentence they must condempne the Church of Constantinople,
in which Sozomenus affirmeth that the manner of confessing
was not onelie lette slippe for a time, but also discontinued
euen til within time of his remembraunce. Yea, let them
condemne of apostacie, not onelie the Church of Constantinople,
but also all the East Churches, which haue neglected that
lawe, which (if they saie true) is inuiolable and commaunded to
all Christians.

of Feuersam, which men called Moredome, that preached at

saide thus of confession: That as through the suggestion of
the fiend, without counsell of anie other bodie, of themselues
manie men and women, can imagin and finde meanes & waies
inough to come to pride, to theft, to lecherie, and to other diuerse
vices: In contrariwise this Monke saide: Since the
Lord God is more readie to forgiue sinnes, then the fiend is, or
maye bée of power to moue anie bodie to sinne: then whosoeuer

will shame and sorrow heartelie for their sinnes, knowledgeing
them faithfullie to GOD, amending them after
their power and cunning without counsell of anie other

all such men and women maie finde sufficient meanes to

               CONFIRMATION.
               
                  What confirmation was.
                  COnfirmation was that Ceremonie, which the Apostles
did vse, when they laide their handes vpon those which
receiued the holy Ghost after they were baptised of them,
and was likewise ordeined by the auncient Fathers. For
the Bishoppes doe vse vppon those children which were
baptised in their infancie, and were afterwarde instructed
a newe in Christes religion, when they came to bée younge
men, that they might in their owne person, and with their
owne tongue allowe and confesse their faith publiklie.
F. N. B. the Italian.
                  
                  This was the matter (saith hée) in times past, that the
children of christians should bée sette before the Bishop, after
they were come to yeares of discreation, that they might perfourme
that which was required of them, that béeing of age
did offer themselues to Baptime. For these sate amonge the
Cathecumeni, vntill (béeing rightlye instructed in the mysteries
of faith) they were able to vtter a confession of their
faith before the Bishoppe and the people. The infants therefore
that were baptised, because then they made no confession
of faith in the Church: at the ende of thei
                        •
                      childehoode, or
in the beginning of their youth, they were againe presented
of their parents, and were examined of the Bishoppe according
to a certeine and common forme of a Catechisme. And
to the intent that this action (which otherwise ought of right
to bée graue and holie) might haue the greater reuerence
and estimation, there was added also a ceremonie of laieng
of handes, so the childe was dismissed, his faith being
approued with a solempne blessing. The auncient Fathers

make often mention of this order. Pope Leo. If anie man returne
from heretiks, let him not againe bée baptised, but let the
vertue of the spirit (which was wanting) be giuen vnto him by
the laieng on of the Bishops hands. Héere our aduersaries will
crie, that it is rightlie called a Sacrament, where the holye
Ghost is giuen. But Leo himself, doth in an other place expound
what he meaneth by these words: He that is baptised (saith he)
of heretiks, let him not be rebaptised, but let him be confirmed
with ye inuocation of the holy Ghost, by the imposition of hands,
because he receiued onely the forme of baptime without sanctification.
Although I doe not denie that Hierome is somewhat
héerein deceiued, that he saith that it is an Apostolicall
obseruation, yet he is most farre from these mens follies. And
he mitigateth it, when hée sayth that this blessing was graunted
onelye to the Bishoppe, rather for the honour of Priesthood,
then by the necessitie of the lawe. Wherefore such an imposition
of hands which is simplie in stead of a blessing, I commend,
and would wish it were at these dayes restored to the
pure vse.

the holye Ghost, vnto the increase of grace, which was giuen
in Baptime, to innocencie of life, to confirme them vnto battell,
which in Baptime were regenerate vnto lyfe. This confirmation
is wrought with annointing and this forme of wordes,
signe thée with the signe of the holye Ghost, and I confirme

                  Of coniuring the Diuell out of infants
in Baptime.
                  
                     The Apostles vsed not the coniurings in Baptime, wherby
they doe coniure the diuell to goe out from the infants that
should be baptised. This they do also altogether without anie
example of Christ or ye Apostles, not onelie as concerning the
ceremonie of Baptime, but also of other. For which of them
euer coniured Satan to depart out of him y• was subiect vnto
sinnes, and possessed of him, not in bodie, but in minde? The
Apostles deliuered such as were possessed with Diuells, commaunding
the spirits to goe out in the name of Iesus Christ,
but we read not, that they did anie such thing with sinners. And
I thinke that our aduersaries be not so mad, to saie ye infants
be corporallie possessed of Satan, for Christ should haue driuen
out the euill spirites out of them which were brought
vnto him, which thing for all that he did not. But if they saye
that this is done because of originall sinne, in respect whereof
infants be in bondage of the kingdome of Satan, then I praie
you, why did not Christ so vnto the publicans & sinners, & the
Apostles vnto all them which they baptised, béeing also conceiued
& borne in sinne: I know (saith Musculus) that this coniuring
was in the Church in the time of Ciprian & Augustine,
but I séeke not what the fathers did, but what Christ did institute,
and what the Apostls did.

                  COntinencie is a vertue or power of the mind, receiued from
the spirit of God, which suppresseth affections, and doth not in

anie wise permit vnlawfull pleasures. This is conuersant and
doth shew it selfe in the common and vsuall talke of men, in
pleasures that are allowed, in apparell, in buildings, and dwelling
houses, in meate and drinke, and in other things also, &c.

                  How Cornelius was iustified by faith,
and not by workes.
                  
                     COrnelius,
                     Act. 10. 4. thy praiers and thine almes, are come vp into remembraunce
before God, &c. ¶The praiers and almes of
Cornelius pleased God before he was baptised, but without faith
God cannot be pleased. Cornelius therefore (as Bede trulie noteth)
had faith, whereby his praiers and almes pleased God, for
(saith he) he came not to faith through workes, but to workes
through faith.
The Bible note.
                  
                  ¶Inasmuch as by workes no man can be saued,Psa. 143. 2 & 130. 3. as the psalmist
openlie affirmeth: In thy sight none that liueth can be iustified.
And againe: If thou looke on our iniquities. Lord who
shall be able to beare them. No christen conscience dare be so
hardie, as to attribute saluation of this man Cornelius, to
his praier and fasting, for first ye see he was a Gentile vncircumcised,
not kéeping the lawe, nor once thinking thereon, and
therefore must be iustified by faith that came by hearing the
glad tidings preached in Christ, and therefore must we looke to
the words of Luke, in the beginning of this Chapter, where he
saith that he feared God, which thing he could not haue done,
neither yet haue praied nor giuen almes, except he had beléeued.
For how should he haue called on him, on whom he beléeued not.
Thus are we compelled to ascribe his calling vnto faith, out of
which these fruites of praier and fasting procéeded, speciallie séeing
that Saint Paule affirmeth that whatsoeuer is not done of
faith, the same is sinne. The christen then, and such as will the
Scriptures to be true in all places, & to expound one texte that
another maie agrée with it, do right well know that his calling
& our saluation is fréelie giuen of God for his son Christs sake,
and not for the deseruing of our workes. And because faith can
receiue this great and free benefite of God, and beléeue it to be
true, and workes neither can beléeue it, neither discerne it,

therfore it is ascribed vnto faith and not to workes. If praier
or fasting or the holiest worke vnder heauen could saue, Christ
had neuer néeded to haue suffered such gréeuous paines, but vtterly
died in vaine. Neither should God fréelie chuse vs, but our
workes should chuse him. Understande therefore, that by his
workes was he not called, but by Faith, out of which his
workes sprong, which faith, God freelie gaue him, as he calleth
and saueth vs all. Good workes must we do as this man
did, and that with all loue and earnestnesse, and thereto are we
bound, and without them can it not be knowen, whether we be
verie christen or no, no more then we can knowe a good Trée
to be good, and neuer felte his fruite. But we maie in no condition
ascribe iustification or saluation to them, for as saith
Christ: When ye haue done all ye can doe, 
                        〈…〉
                      ye are vnprofitable
seruaunts, but to faith which onelie can receiue the benefites
of Christ, and beléeue that he alone hath deserued forgiuenesse
for the sinnes of all the world. The Apostles were héere
first taught and certified by the holie Ghost, of the conuersion
of the Gentiles.

                  From whence our corruption commeth.
                  
                     ADam was not created in the corruption which is spoken off
héere, but he purchased it of himselfe. For God found all
the things to be good which he had made. Man therefore who is
the excellentest of all creatures, was not marred after that fashion,
till he had withdrawen himselfe from God. But when he
had once seperated himselfe from the Fountaine of righteousnesse,
what coulde remaine vnto him but naughtinesse and corruption.
Thus wée sée from whence all our naughtinesse procéedeth,
& that we ought not to blame God for the vices wherevnto
we be subiect, and vnder which we be helde prisoners, according
to the Scripture which saith, that wee bée solde vnder
simie, and become the bonde slaues of Satan. Wée must

not blame God for this, but we must learne to knowe that it is
the heritage which we haue from our father Adam, and therefore
we must take the whole blame to our selues before God, &c.

is Image seruice. Col. 3. 5. It maketh men to erre from
the faith. 1. Tim. 6. 10. It hath no part of the kingdome of Christ
and God. Ephe. 5. 5. It hardened the heart of Pharao, that the
faith of the miracles of God, could not sinke into it. It made
Balaam which knewe all the trueth of GOD to hate it, and
to giue most pestilent counsell against it. It taught the false prophets
in the olde Testament, to interpret the Law of God falslie,
&c. It kept Iudas in vnbeliefe, &c. And compelled him to sell
Christ vnto the Scribes and Pharesies, for couetousnesse, is a
thing mercilesse. Couetousnesse made the Pharisies to lye on
Christ, to persecute and falselie to accuse him. It made Pilate,
though he found him an Innocent, yet to slaie him. It caused
Herode to persecute Christ in his cradle. It maketh hypocrites,
to persecute the truth against their owne conscience, &c. Finallie,
Couetousnes maketh manie (whom the truth pleaseth at the
beginning) to cast it vp againe, and to be afterwarde the most
cruell enimies thereof, after the ensample of Symon Magus.

                     THere was a Councell gathered together at Hierusalem, a
little before y• Christ reueled himselfe, to chuse a Priest in
the roome of one that was deceased. Looke how manie letters
there are in the Hebrue tongue, so manie Priests there were in
the Temple: to wit. 22. The manner was to register in a certaine

                        •
                     ooke reserued in the Temple, the daie of the election, the
name of the elected, the name of his father, of his mother, and of
his Tribe. Whilest that they thought some on one man, some on
another, ther stepped forth a Priest one of the multitude, & said:
My wil is that Iesus the sonne of Ioseph the carpenter be elected
Priest, who, though he be young in yeares, yet passeth he in
vtteraunce, wisedome, and manners. I thinke trulie there
was neuer séene in Hierusalem such a one, both for eloquence,
life and manners, the which I am sure all that inhabite Hierusalem
doe knowe as well as I. The which was no sooner spoken,
but was allowed of, and the partie (I meane Iesus) chosen
to be a Priest. They doubt of his Tribe, againe they wer therin
resolued. They call for his parents to register their names.
The Priest that sauoured Iesus, made aunswere that Ioseph
his father was dead, yet Mary his mother was a liue. She was
brought before them, she affirmed that she was his mother, and
that Iesus was hir sonne. But she said moreouer that hée had
no father on earth, that she was a Uirgin, and the holie Ghost
had ouershadowed hir. They sent for the Midwiues, and also for
such as had bene present at the birth, she was found to be a virgin.
In the ende, they concluded with one voice, that hée should
be registred, Iesus the Sonne of God, and of Mary the virgin.
We remember moreouer Iosephus to haue said, that Iesus sacrificed
in the Temple together with the Priests. Héerevpon also
it fell out, that as Iesus entered into the Synagogue of the
Iewes, the booke was deliuered vnto him, where he read of the
Prophet Esay: whereby we gather, that if Iesus had not bene
Priest among the Iewes, the bóoke would not haue bene deliuered
vnto him. Neither is it permitted amongst vs Christians,
for anie to read holie Scripture in the open assemblie, vnlesse
he be of the Cleargie. So farre Suidas, as he learned of
a Iewe.

Lawe, that he spake against Moses, wherefore, for the remouing
of this suspition, and for the winning of the bretheren the Councell

Constantine was present with 318. Bishops, by whome
was determined against Arrius, that the Sonne was equall
with the Father. Which decrée was confirmed by the Emperour,
and Arrius with 6. Bishops banished. This Councell
willing to reforme the life of man, did set certaine lawes, the
which certaine men would haue had a Lawe, to be brought in,
that the Bishops, Priests, Deacons and Subdeacons, should not
lie with their wiues which they had married before their consecration.
But Paphuntius a Confessour (being vnmarried himselfe)
did withstand them, and said that their marriage was honourable,
and it was pure Chastitie for them to lie with their
wiues. So that the Councell was perswaded, not to make anie
such law, affirming it to be a grieuous occasion, both vnto them
and also vnto their wiues of fornication. The Councel did allow
this sentence, so y• nothing was decréed as concerning this thing,
but euery man was left to his own frée wil, & not bound of any
necessitie. ¶Héere is to be noted, that this holy Councell, did not
recken it an vnpure & filthie thing for a Bishop or a Priest to
companie with his wife, but to graunt that it is a pure & a cleane
chastitie, for a Priest to companie with his wife. Also at this
Councell it was decréed, that the Patriarkes of Alexandria and
Antiochia, should haue like power ouer the Countreies about
those Cities, as the Bishops of Rome, had ouer the Countreies
about Rome.

that no maried man should be saued. Also he taught that priests

no Deacon nor Priests shall companie with their wiues: therfore
we notwithstanding that decrée, following the rules of the
Apostles, and the constitutions of holie men, will that from this
daie foorth, mariage shall be lawfull, in no wise dissoluing the
matrimonie betwéen them and their wiues, nor depriuing them
their familiaritie in time conuenient. Whosoeuer therfore shall
be found able of the order of Deacons, Subdeacons, or of priesthood,
we will that no such men be prohibited, to ascend the dignities
aforesaid, for the cohabitation of their wiues. Nor that
they be constrained, at the receipt of the orders, to professe chastitie

                        •
                     or to abstain from the companie of their lawfull wiues. It
followeth, if anie man presume therefore against the Canons
of ye Apostles, to depriue Priests or Deacons from the copulation
and fellowship of their lawfull wiues, let such a man bée
deposed. Semblablie both Priests and Deacons which putteth
away their wiues, vnder ye colour of holines, let them be excommunicate,

trouble and disquieting of the same. For there was a long season
horrible contention among the Prelates and Bishops ther
assembled, whether the authoritie of the Romane Bishop were
of more power then a generall Councel or not. Insomuch that
of diuers learned Bishops and other, it was concluded that
the Bishop of Rome was an Heretike,The Pope an Heretike. and by their consents
was deposed, because he would not obey the authoritie of the
generall Councell. Eugenius the Bishop perceiued that the
Councell entended diuers things contrarie to his prerogatiue,
endeuoured by all meanes possible to delaie the same councell,
or to transfer it to some other place, wher more fauour shuld be
shewed him, as at Bouenia, Ferraria, Florentia, or other where,
but by the aduertisement of the Emperour, he graunted it to
procéede at Basile. But there present he would not be for nothing.
At this Councell Eugenius was deposed, and Amodius
Duke of Sauoie in Fraunce chosen in his place. But Eugenius
notwithstanding continued still as Bishop,A Duke made Pope. and would not
resigne.

                  This Councell by reason of a great Pestilence was transferred
to Florence,
                     Ferrare where the Christians of Arminia and India
consented to the Romane church, and the Greekes agréed that
the holie Ghost procéeded from the Father and the Sonne, that
there was a Purgatorie, that the Sacrament ought to be celebrated
onelie with vnleauened bread made of wheate, and that
the Bishop of Rome was Peters lawful successour, and Christs
glorious Uicar on earth,The Popes supremacie graunted. to whome all the world ought to
obaie, which they neuer consented to before this time, neither
at this time did long continue in that beliefe.

                  In the Councell of Milinitani,
                     Milinetani. it was decréed, that if a
Clearke of Afrike would appeale out of Afrike beyonde the
Sea, he should be taken as a person excommunicate.
                  In the generall Councell of Constantinople the first, it
was decréed, that euerie cause betwéene anie person, should be

determined within the Prouinces, where the matters did lie:
and that no Bishoppe should exercise anie power out of his
owne Diocesse or Prouince. And this was also the minde of
holie Saint Ciprian
                           •

                  Therefore the Pope hath no such Primacie giuen him,
either by the wordes of Scripture, or by anie generall
Councell, nor by common consent of the holie Catholike
faith.

them and with his spirite doth assist them. But if they be gathered
in their owne name, that is to saie, to set foorth their
owne glorie, they are vtterlie destitute of the Holie Ghost,

of Matrimonie Inter raptorem & raptam. And the
saieng of S. Hierome was afterward preferred aboue the sta

                     ute
of the Councell, as it is prooued 36. Question 2. Tria.
For in things concerning the faith, the saieng of a priuate man,
is to bee preferred aboue the Pope, if hee haue better reasons
and Scriptures out of the olde and new Testament for him,
then the Pope hath. Neither it can helpe that the Councell
cannot erre,Erre. because that Christ did praie, that the faith of
the Church should not faile: for I aunswere to this, that
though the generall doe represent the whole vniuersall Church,
yet neuerthelesse in verie déed, ther is not the vniuersall Church,
but representatiue. For the vniuersall Church standeth in the
election of all faithfull men throughout the whole world, whose
head and spouse is Christ Iesus. And the Pope is but the Uicar
of Christ, and not the verie head of the Church. This is the
Church that cannot erre.
                  The Councells that maie be gathered together in euerie prouince,
must without doubt giue place to the authoritie of y• full

Councells which be gathered of all Christendome. And also
these full Councells oftentimes must be amended by the full
councells that came afterward, if anie thing be opened by experience
that was before shut, and if anie thing be knowen,
that was afore hidden. And this must be done, without anie
shadowe of supersticious pride, without anie boasted arrogancie,
without anie contention of malicious enuie, but with holy
méeknesse, with holie peace, & with christen charitie. ¶Héere
Saint Augustine saith plainlie, that the full Councells maie
erre, and maie be reformed.

of the finding of the holie crosse by Helene Constantines
mother, saith: Inuenit ergo Helena titulum, &c. Helene
therefore did finde the title, she worshipped the king and not the
wood verelie. For this is an errour of the Gentles, & a vanitie
of the vngodly: but she worshipped him y• hung vpon the wood,
which was written in the title. ¶Héere we sée that to worship
euē the verie crosse that Christ did hang vpon, it is an errour
of the Gentles, and a vanitie of the vngodlie. Now if the
crosse that Christ died and hung vpon, and did imbrue with his
bloud, maie not be worshipped vnlesse we will runne into the
errour of the idolatrous heathen, and into the vanitie of the
vngodlie: how much lesse ought the other crosses, that are onlie
made after the figure and likenesse of it, be worshipped.

Prophet vnto Christ, we must vnderstand by the Crowne of
golde, the great victorie that Christ had ouer the Diuell, the
World, Death, Damnation and Hell. And if we will apply
this place of the vearse to the members of Christ, which be, all
iust liuers and faithfull beleeuers, then wée must vnderstande

they doe alleadge for it, the glorious victorie that GOD
gaue to Dauid ouer the Ammonites, whose King, Dauid tooke
prisoner, and did weare his Crowne of golde. This Crowne
of golde which Dauid gotte in Battell, is thought to bée the
Crowne whereof mention is made, when the Prophet saith,
Posuisti in capite, &c. But for as much, as the Psalme
is a Propheticall Scripture, which taketh place to the
ende of the world in all other godlie Kings as well as Dauid,
and speciallie is most verefied in Christ, and in all his true
members, therefore it is better and more sound interpretation
to vnderstand by the Crowne of golde the heauenlie glorie

Cup from his owne proper signification, both in good part
& in euill, is verie rife in the Scripture, for God hath allotted

vnto euerie man his portion of prosperitie or aduersitie by mesure
certeine, and he shall drinke it whether he will or no. In
this sentence following, it is taken in euill part: The spirit of
tempest is the portion of their cup. Psal. 11. 6. that is to say, vengeance
is the reward, that God hath ordeined for their wickednesse.
In these sentences following it is taken in good part:
The Lord is the lot of my part and of my cup. Psal. 16. 5. that
is to saie, he is my appointed heritage: Also my ouerflowing
cup. Psal. 23. 5. that is to saie, the goods which God hath giuen
vnto me as my lot, are abundant. Moreouer, Christ saith, Can
ye drinke of the cup that I shall drinke? Math. 20. 22. by which
wordes Christ demaunded of the sonnes of Zebedie, whether

               CVSTOME.
               
                  A definition of custome.
                  CUstome (saith Ostiensis) is an vse agréeing with reason, allowed
by the common institution of them that vse it, whose
beginning is time out of minde, or which is by a iust time prescribed
and confirmed, so that it is by no contrarie act interrupted,
but allowed with contradictorie iudgement. This is (as he
thinketh) a full definition. But in that hee saith, that that vse
ought to bée agréeing with reason, it is not sufficient. But first
it is to be said that it ought to agrée with the word of God, for
that is to be counted for the chiefe reason. Afterward it must be
allowed by the institution of the people, and of whose beginning
there is no mention, or that it is prescribed by a iust time, and
appointed by the laws, neither is interrupted by anie contrarie
action. For if a Iudge or Prince shall giue iudgement against
it, the custome is broken. As it also happeneth in prescription
is cast out of his possession, or the matter is called into lawe, &
the matter is in plead, the prescriptiō is broken. Also the allowing
of the contradictorie iudgement ought to be had, that is, whē
one part alleadgeth the custome, and an other part denieth it.
If it be pronounced on the custome side, that doth confirme it.
But all these things as I haue before saide, must be reckoned
vnto the rule of Gods word.
Pet. Mar. vpon Iudic. fol. 190.
                  
               
               
                  Of vicious customes, and what difference is betweene
a lawe and a custome.
                  In the countrie of Taurus, there was a custome to kill
straungers and guestes. The Persians had a custome neuer to
deliberate of waightie matters, but in feastes, and when they
were dronke. Among the Sauromates there was a custome, that
when they were drinking they solde their daughters. These prescribe
not, when they are manifestly vicious and ill. But that
custome prescribeth, which is neither against the worde of
God, nor the lawe of nature, nor the common lawe. For the

right of custome commeth by the approbation and secret consent
of the people. Otherwise whie are we bounde vnto
lawes? But because they were made, the people consenting
and agréeing vnto them. For this is the difference betwéene
a custome and a lawe, because in the one is a secrete assent,
but in the other an open assent. Wherefore such customes cannot
bée reckoned without daunger. Aristotle in Polîticis, admonisheth
that men which haue learned to doe sinister things,
ought not to bée compelled to doe thinges dextere. Wherefore
in thinges indifferent and of no great value, custome is to be
retained. It is an olde Prouerbe, Lawe and Countrie, for
euerie region hath certeine customes of their owne, which cannot
easilie bée chaunged. But it is sayd when they are against
the word of God, or against nature, or the common lawe, they
are not prescribe. For then are they not onelie customes, but
beastlie cruelties.

                  How custome must yeeld to the word of God,
and to truth.
                  It is chieflie to be considered howe the Apostle layeth
the Oracle of God against an olde receiued custome. We are
taught by this example, that such is the authoritie of Gods
worde, that vnto it all thinges which were instituted of men,
of a godlie zeale and holye intent, ought to giue place, as
soone as they séeme anie waies to make against the will of
God. Therefore their obstinacie is verie péeuish and pernicious
that goe about to reteine these Ceremonies in the church,
which it appeareth haue béene deuised by foolish men, for the
confirmation of superstition, and are verie derogatorie to the
merites of Christ. They thinke it a daungerous matter to alter
or chaunge anie thing. But it is much more daungerous
to sticke to the obseruation of olde errours with the losse of
saluation. And wée ought to remember that the obedience of
faith is the ende of true christianitie, which requireth of vs to
denie our selues, and to resigne and yeelde vp all our thoughts
and iudgementes, vnto the will and power of God. Gualter
vpon the words of Saint Peter to Cornelius men. vz. But God
hath shewed me that I should not call anie thing common or
vncleane, &c.
                  
                     After the truth is once found out,Augustin let custome giue place
vnto the truth, let no man set custome before the truth and reason,
for reason and truth putte euermore custome to silence.
                  If you laye custome for your selfe,G
                           •
                        egorie. ye must remember that
Christ sayth, I am the waie, the truth, and the life: he saith not,
I am custome, and doubtlesse anie custome bée it neuer so
auncient, neuer so common, yet must it néedes yéelde vnto
truth.
                  If onelie Christ must be heard,Cipriane. we maie not weigh what
anie man hath thought good to doe that hath bene before vs, but
what Christ hath first done which is before all, for wée maie
not followe the custome of man, but the truth of God. Speciallie
for that God saith by the Prophet Esaie, they worshippe me
in vaine, teaching the commaundements and doctrines of men.

of the wéeke Sabbatum, the Sabboth daie. And the next
daie they called Prima Sabbati. As we maie perceiue by
the wordes of the Euangelist Saint Mathewe, saieng: Vespere
autem sabbati quae lucessit in prima sabbati, venit Maria
Magdalena, & altera Maria videre sepnlchrum. Upon the
Sabboth daie at night, which dawneth vpon the first of the sabbots,
came Marie Magdalene, and an other Marie, to behold the
Sepulchre: and that same daie that Saint Mathew calleth Prima
Sabbati. Saint Marke in the 16. Chapter doth call it Vna

daie, Secunda Sabbati, the third, Tercia Sabbati, the fourth,
Quarta Sabbati, the fift, Quinta Sabbati. And the sixt which we
call Fridaie, they did call Sexta Sabbati, vell dies parascenes:

names of their Gods which they did wéekelie worship, Primum
dicabant sole, secundum lunae. The first daie in the honour of
the Sunne (which they did count the giuer of light) they did call
Dies soli, Sundaie. The second in y• honour of the Moone, which
they did count the giuer of the bodie, they did call Dies lunae
Mundaie. The third daie in the honour of Mars, whome they
did worshippe as the giuer of lustie courage, they did call Dies
Marti, Tuesdaie. The fourth day in the honour of Mercurie,
to whome they did ascribe the gift of wisdome and eloquence
they did cal Dies Mercurij, Wednesdaie. The fift daie in the honour
of Iupiter, to whome they did ascribe the gift of temperaunce,

is left out quite, the reason whereof the Fathers haue rendered
to be this: namelie, that Antichrist shoulde bée borne of
the Tribe of Dan, according to Iacobs prophesie: Dan is an
Adder in the waie. Gene. 47. 17. which thing agréeth verie well
by mysticall signification, (that is to saie, by the interpretation
of the name) vnto Antichrist, that is to saie, the Pope. For

                  Wherefore he absteined from the kings meate.
                  But Daniel purposed in his heart, not to bée polluted with
the portion of the kings meate and drinke. ¶Héere some doe
doubt whether anie such matter were in the meate and the
drinke, that Daniel ought to absteine from them. For this seemeth
some note of superstition, and we knowe that all thinges
are pure, vnto the pure, which rule is true in all worldes.
                  
                     Againe we doe reade no such thing of Ioseph. And it is verie
like that Daniel afterward did vse such meates when hée
was in his great authoritie with the king: wherfore this was
not alwaies obserued of Daniel, and therefore it maie séeme
now either an vnaduised zeale, or too much singularitie. To
this maie be aunswered, that God alloweth it in Daniel, and
in his fellowes, as it were by myracle, preseruing them faire
liking in their mourning and straite diet, and therefore it is
not to be doubted, but by Gods spirit they wer thus at ye first
moued to absteine for a time from the kings delicates, and só
to record that they were exiles and captiues brought from the
holie citie and the holie kinred of Abraham into an idolatrous
countrie and people, whose manners were abhominable vnto
them, and so they count their fine meates and deintie fare, pollution
and abhomination for the consequence that woulde
haue ensued, if they had greedelie giuen themselues vnto them.
For Daniel knew the daunger, that they should haue béene
corrupted with heathenish manners, if they had thus at y• first
giuen themselues vp to haue bene abused with sumptuous
fare and princelie dishes. Wherefore absteining from them he
kéepeth his minde in reuerence to God, he reteineth the remembraunce
of his owne state and countrie, hée disapointeth
the King of his craftie purpose, and groweth into more credit
through Gods prouidence.

should not entice him by this sweete poison to forgette his religion
and accustomed sobrietie, and that in his meate and
drinke, hée might dailye remember of what people he was.
And Daniel bringeth this into shewe, how God from the beginnning
assisted him with his spirit, and at length called
him to be a Prophet.

ben thought a natural Eclipse, and so not regarded of men. But
to haue Iudea couered with darknesse, and the Sunne to thine
in other places, was a more notable myracle. Tertulian doth
affirme in this Apologitico, that this darknesse of the Sunne
was written in the booke of auncient monuments of ye 
                     Romans.

things which were kept of this matter in the monumentes of

foorth by one or two writers, yet notwithstanding ye historie of
their times was so common, that such a notable myracle could
not be buried in silence, of so manie which diligentlie obserued
those things, which were not so well worthie to be remembred.

was in seruice with him before. Ans. It might bée that Abner

but that is not so, for the text saith afterward, if thy seruants
be cleane fro women: So that it appeareth that he had
men with him, but yet verie few, in comparison of them that
he was wont to haue. And therefore Ahimelech saith, Whie
commest thou alone. The Euangelist S. Mathew also saith,
haue ye not read what Dauid did when he was an hungred,
and they that were with him, how he entered into the house of
God, and did eate the shew breads which were not lawful for

him to eate, neither for them which were with him, but onelie

                  Why the people flocked to Dauid.
                  And there gathered vnto him,1. Re. 
                           •
                        2. 2 all men that were in comberaunce
and in debt. ¶The peoples gathering to Dauid, was
not to assemble a rebellious multitude to inuade King Saule,
and to depose him from the Crowne, to set vp himsel
                        •
                     e. For neither
they came for anie such purpose, but for their succour, béeing
in debt and trouble or otherwise vexed: Neither did Dauid
send for them nor incited anie to take his part, nor proclaimed
himselfe to be King, or published the Lords anointing of him,
or euer vsed that multitude that came vnto him, for anie such
purpose. And yet the question is moued, both by Caietanus and
Lyranus héerevpon. The question (saith Ca
                           •
                        etanus) ariseth, whether
it were lawfull for Dauid to receiue these debters, in the
preiudice of the Creditours that had lent them? The solution
is, that if these men had houses, fieldes or vineyards, they are
vnderstood to haue lefte their goods vnto them. But if they were
vtterlie vnable to paie their debts, they were excused for their
vnabilitie, vntill their better abilitie. For, that Dauid excellentlie
instructed all thē that came vnto him, while he taried in
that Caue. The Psalme testifieth: I will praise the Lord at all
times, Conteining (according to the letter) a doctrine giuen ther
of Dauid vnto the Souldiers. Therefore Dauid receiued not
these men in preiudice of their Creditours. And thus as he did
not receiue them to the preiudice of anie priuate man: so hée
receiued them not to the preiudice of the King & publike state.
Where as Lyra moueth the other question, saieng: In that
hée became their Captaine, it séemeth hée sinned in receiuing

such as Abimelech receiued: the needie and vagabonds assembling
them vnto him, as is contained Iudi. 9. We must saie that
he gathered them, not to slaie the innocent, as did Abimelech to
slaie his bretheren, neither to spoile the faithfull. For we read
not that he spoiled ye people of Israel, but rather kept their goods,
as is conteined afterward. 1. Reg. 25. of Nabal, but he gathered
them to persecute the Infidells, as is contained afterward in
manie places, & to kéepe his owne bodie from the ambushment
of Saule. The which he might doe in such a necessitie, chiefelie
when he was now anointed King. By reason whereof in such a
case, he might prolong the paiment of the debtes, and in manie
the forfeifure is released in the case aforesaid.

                  How Dauids adulterie was punished.
                  When God minded to punish Dauid for rauishing Bethsabe,
                     2. Reg. 11. 4
he said vnto him, Thou hast done this thing priuelie, but I
will make the Sunne to beare witnesse of it. How was that?
What was that God would doe vnto Dauid? It was that Absalom
should rauish his fathers wiues,2. Reg. 16. 22. and defile them in the presence
of all the people, in the sight of the Sunne.

                     Dauid did that which was right in the sight of God,3. Re. 15. 5 and turned
from nothing that he commaunded him, all the daies of his
life, saue onelie in the matter of Vrias the Hethite. ¶This
séemeth not to be true, for it is said in another place, that he did
sinne in numbring his people, & in the sentence he gaue againe
Mephiboseth. But it is to be vnderstood, that these sinnes were
nothing in respect of that he had committed against Vrias, & therfore
were not reputed vnto him.

reporteth how it was the Diuel that stirred vp all the mischife,
when Dauid numbred so the people of God. Dauid then being
one of Gods children, was notwithstanding sometimes deliuered
vnto the power of Satan, to be beguiled by him. Now
when we sée this, we haue good cause to praie vnto God, and
to come and shrowd our selues vnder the shadow of his wings,

and there to hide vs. For if such things befell vnto Dauid, what
shall become of vs, &c.

                  How Dauncing is a cursed mirth.
                  THe wicked runne after the Tabor and the Flute, &c. ¶It
is true,Iob. 21. 12 that the Flute and the Tabor and such other like
things are not to be condemned, simplie of their owne nature:
but onelie in respect of mens abusing of them, for most commonlie
they peruerte the good vse of them: For certainlie,
the Tabor doth not sooner sound to make men merrie, but
there is alwaies lightlie some vanitie, I saie not supersticious,
but beastlie. For behodle men are so caried awaie, as they
cannot sport themselues with moderate mirth, but they fling
themselues into the aire, as though they would leape out

of themselues. This then Iob ment to note héere a cursed mirth,
& a mirth that God condemned. Wherby we ought to take warning,
to restrain our selues from such loose & wanton pastimes,
but let vs rather aduisedlie restraine our selues, and set God alwaies
before our eies, to the ende that he maie blesse our mirth,
and we so vse his benefites, as we maie neuer cease to trauell
vp to heauen ward. Thus you sée it behooueth vs to applie all
our mirth to this ende, namelie, that there maie be a melodie
founding in vs, whereby the name of God maie be blessed and
glorified in our Lord Iesus Christ, &c.

                  Against Dauncing vsed in these daies.
                  As it is lawfull to sing, and we vse singing to giue thankes
vnto God, & to celebrate the praises, so also by a moderate dauncing,
we maie testifie the ioie and mirth of the minde. For
Dauid publikelie daunced before the Arke of the Lorde, and
the Maidens with daunces and songs, celebrated his victorie against
Goliah. Maria also sister of Moses when Phar

                     erthrowen and slaine, led daunces with other women, & sung
a song of victorie. Wherefore seeing holie men and chaft women
vsed daunces, we cannot saie that of their owne nature they be
vicious. But as it is vsed in these daies that men should daunce
mingled together with women, ought not to be suffered, because
that those things are nourishments and prouokers of wantonnesse
& lusts. Maria the sister of Moses daunced not with young
men, but apart by hir selfe among women. Neither Dauid
daunced with women: and maidens which celebrated his victorie
daunced among themselues, and not with men.

                  What Daunces are honest, and what euill.
                  Let vs remember, that although honest Matrimonies, are
sometimes brought to passe by dauncing, yet much more are adulteries
and fornications wont to followe of their spectacles.
We ought to followe the examples of godlie fathers, who now
and then vsed daunces, but yet such as wer moderate and chast,
so that the men daunced by themselues, and the women aparte
by themselues: by such kinde of daunces they shewed forth the
gladnesse of their mindes, they sang praises vnto God, and gaue
him thankes for some notable bene
                        •
                     ite, which they had receiued.
But we read not in holie Scripture of mingled daunces of men

and women together. But our men saie: who can daunce after
that sort? In saieng so, they vtter themselues, what they séeke
for in dauncing.

dauncings. But now a daies there are some Bishoppes which
are present at daunces, and doe daunce together with women,
so farre are they off to restraine this vice. The same Augustine,
vpon the 32. Psal. (when he expoundeth these wordes of
the Psalter, Of ten strings I will sing vnto thée) maketh these
ten strings the ten Commaundements: and when he had spoken
somewhat of one of them, at last he commeth to the Sabboth
daie. I saie not (saith he) to liue delicatelie, as the Iewes
were wont. For it is better to digge all the whole daie, then
to daunce on the Sabboth daie.

                  In the beginning of the 8. Chapter of the Acts, Saint Luke
declareth, that all the Apostles did still remaine at Hierusalem,
                     
wherefore it could not be Philip the Apostle which was now
at Hierusalem, but it must néedes be Philip the Deacon, that
was dispearsed with the rest, & came to Samaria, where he now
preached and baptised. And of this iudgment is Caluine, whose
words vpon the place and Chapter be these S. Luke had before
declared that the Apostles did not step from Hierusalem, it is
probable, that one of the 7. Deacons, whose daughters did prophecie
is héere mentioned, &c.

charge of the common treasures of the Church, and of the poore,
yet was it héerewith permitted vnto them to take the office of
preaching, if at anie time necessitie required, as we haue hetherto
seene in the example of Stephen. And peraduenture there
was not so great neede of Deacons at Hierusalem, when the
Church was through persecution dispearsed, and therefore they
which before wer stewards of the Church goods, did giue themselues
whollie to the ministerie of the word.

by which we maie doe after the Lawe, and the same is to be deliuered
from the Lawe of death.

for our sinnes, wherby God is pleased, and his wrath appeased,
and for Christs sake the holie Ghost is giuen to all beléeuers,

the wicked ariseth from his wickednesse, and whereby the sinner
is brought from the death of his sinnes, into the life of righteousnesse,
and speciallie of the calling of the Gentiles, which
was done after the comming of the holie Ghost. For the Gentiles
are counted as dead men in comparison of the Iewes. And

                  O Lord God almightie,Bar. 3. 4. the God of Israel, heare now the
praiers of the dead Israelites. ¶Ye must vnderstand, that
Baruch in his praiers speaketh not of them that wer dead with
bodilie death, but of the wicked which liuing vnto the world,
were dead vnto God, which figuratiue manner of speaking, is
oftentimes vsed in the Scripture. For in the Gospell of our sauiour
Iesus Christ, he saith: Suffer the dead to burie ye dead:
as if he should saie, let the worldlings that be d
                        •
                     ad vnto God,
and good workes, burie them that be departed out of this life,
(for that is an office most méet for them) but do thou the things
that be for the liuing. The like phrase or manner of speaking
doth the holie Apostle vse, when he saith, A widdow liuing in
deliciousnesse, though she be aliue, yet she is dead. Besides this,
Baruch by such kinde of words, doth set forth ye miserable estate
of the Children of Israel, which were euen as dead men are in
the world, because of their captiuitie and thraldome, & straight
bondage or slauerie, that they were in, which was vnto them

as a graue or pit, that the dead be buried in. This is the true
vnderstanding of Baruch in this place.

                  How shall we that are dead to sinne,Rom. 6. 2 liue yet therein. ¶They
are said of Paule to be dead to sinne, which are in such sorte
made pertakers of the vertue of Christ, that the naturall corruption
is dead in them, that is, the force of it is put out, and
it bringeth not foorth his bitter fruits: and on the other side,
they are said to liue to sinne, which are in the flesh, that is,
whom the spirite of God, hath not deliuered from the stauerie
of the corruption of nature.

and Baptime ouer the Dead.
                  It hath bene also decréed and determinded,Cone. ter. Carthag. that the Sacrament
of thankes-giuing should not be ministred vnto the dead
bodies, for it is said of the Lorde, Take and eate, but the dead
corpses canne neither take nor eate: we must beware that
our weake bretheren doe not beléeue that, that it is lawfull
to baptise ouer the dead, vnto whom it is not lawfull to minister
the Sacrament of thanks-giuing. ¶This doth sufficientlie
declare, that both S. Austen & all other fathers ought to be
vnderstood, when they speak of the praiers for the dead, & of the
sacrifice that is offred for them, for they are not of opinion that
their praiers & oblations could help the soules departed out of
Purgatorie, which began in Austens time to be onlie in question
he himselfe daring affirme nothing touching the same.

                  As concerning that Iob saith,Iob. 14. 21 that the men which is departed,
knoweth not what is done héere below, nor whether his ofspring
be poore or rich, it is not to ground an Article of our
faith vpon, that such as be gone out of this world, knoweth not
what our state is. For Iob spake as a man encombred. Therfore
we must not take héere anie certaintie of doctrine neither
is it greatly for vs to enquire of such matters. And why? Let
it suffice vs that God hath set vs in this world to cōmunicate
one with another, & euory man ought to employ himselfe vpon
his neighbours God hath giuen me such a gift or abilitie, and
therfore I must applie my selfe y• waie. Againe, one of vs maie

praie for another, but when he hath taken vs out of this
world, the said communicating is taken awaie from vs, & there
is no communicating as there was before. Neither must we do
as the Papists doe, who are woont to runne to the deceased
Saints, as though they had not yet finished their course. Now
forasmuch as the Scripture teacheth vs not what we ought to
doe in this behalfe: lette vs leaue that thing in doubt and in
suspense whereof we haue no certaine resolution, by the word
of God: For singlenesse of minde is also a thing, wherein it behooueth
vs to walke. &c.

an impediment in his speach, and they praied him to putte

a man maie be saued by another mans faith, for this man was
healed by the faith of the men, and not by his owne, because he
could not heare, for faith commeth by hearing. To this it maie
be said, there is a difference betwéene corporall benefites and
euerlasting saluation. But no mans faith can stand in steed for
another, touching saluation. Now Christ loosed the tongue of
the deafe, and then being called vpon of him, hée gaue him

               DESTINIE.
               SAint Augustine in Opusculo. 82. questionum. quest. 45.
Confuting soundlie the destinies of Planets, among other
his reasons saith: The conceiuing of Twinnes in the mothers
wombe because it is made in one and the same act, as the Phisitians
testifie (whose discipline is farre more certaine and manifest
then that of the Astrologers) doth happen in so small a
moment of time, that ther is not so much time as two minutes
of a minute, betwixt the conceiuing of the one and the other.
               How therefore commeth it that in Twinnes of one burden,
there is so great a diuersitie of déedes, wills and chaunces, considering
that they of necessitie must needes haue one & the same
Planet in their conception, and that the Mathematicalls doe
giue the constellation of them both, as it it were but of one man.
To these wordes of Saint Augustine (saith Bullinger) great
light maie be aded, if you annexe to them and examine narrowlie
the example of Esau and Iacobs birth, and sundrie dispositions.

that Destinie doth rule, will haue not onelie our déedes and
euents, but also our verie wills to depend vpon the placing of
the starres, as the time wherein euerie man is either conceiued
or borne, which placing they are wont to call Constellations,
but the grace of God doth not onelie goe aboue all starres
and heauens but also aboue the verie Angells themselues.

               DEATH.
               
                  What Death is by the minde of Secundus
the Philosopher.
                  WHen Adrian the Emperour had heard Secundus the Philosopher
in the seuerall Oration he made of a noble Romane
Matron, a kinswoman of the Emperours, he asked of
him what death was, to whom the philosopher answered thus:
Death is an eternall sléepe, a dissolution of the bodie, a terror
of the rich, a desire of y• poore, a thing inheritable, a pilgrimage
vncertaine, a théefe of man, a kinde of sléeping, a seperation of
the liuing, a companie of the dead, a resolution of all, a rest of
trauailes, an end of all idle desires. Finallie, death is y• scourge
of all euill, and the chiefe reward of the good.
                  ¶We call death the loosing asunder and departing of two
things, the soule from the bodie: y• which departing no man can
escape, but necessarilie die all we must, that be borne in this
world. When the bodie by anie violence looseth his senses, & is
spoiled from the quicke vse of his principall parts, the
                        ••
                      departeth
the soule from him, & in manner the bodie leaueth y• soule,
before the soule leaueth the bodie. For it is not y• soule by himselfe
y• goeth from the bodie, but it is the bodie by himselfe sorsaking
life, that causeth the soule to depart, &c.

                  The Diuell hath y• power of death,Heb. 2. 14. that is 
                        •
                     he is the authour
of it, by his malitious nature he brought it into the worlde:
for God made it not, nor hath anie delight in it, neither is
it good in his eies, nor was neuer mentioned among y• works
of his hands: but from the Diuell, and of the Diuell, and in
the Diuell it began, and is, and videth. And therfore in the Apocalips
his name is giuen him, Abaddon, that is, the destroier:
and as death is of him, so for this cause also, he is said to
haue the power of it, because through his manifest temptations,
he maketh men sin, by which death raigneth. &c.

                  Of euerlasting death.
                  He shall neuer sée death.Iohn. 8. 51. ¶What els is the meaning of
this which Christ saith, he shall neuer sée death, but because he
sawe another death, from y• which he came to deliuer vs. That

is to sai
                        •
                      the second death, euerlasting death; death of hell fire
the death of damnation with the Diuell and his Angells, that
is death indeede. Therfore neuer to see death, is nothing els but
to haue euerlasting life. So that we maie note and learne héere
that faith is the waie to immortalitie, and that Christians doe
trulie liue and neuer die, although in this world they bee more
like to dead men then to liuing men, & to die in bodie by other
men. For the saieng of Christ héere is most true, to the which
also agreeth this place. Euerie one which liueth and beleeuth in
me, shall neuer die.

which are loosened from their bodies are bereft of vnderstanding,
or touched with no affection to God ward.
Caluine. vpon the 6. Psal.

praise God in the Congregation.

                  In what respect the children of God,
maie wish death.
                  O that God would begin to smite me,Iob. 6. 9. that he would lette
his hand goe, and take me awaie. ¶True it is, that Gods
children maie well wish death, howbeit to another ende, and
for another respect then Iob doth héere, like as all of vs must
with S. Paule desire to be let loose from the bondage of sinne,
wherein we be helde prisoners. Saint Paule is not mooued
there, with anie temptation of his flesh, but rather the desire
that he hath to imploie himselfe in Gods seruice without let,
seemeth him to wish, that he might passe out of the prison of
his bodie. Why so? For so long as we be in this worlde, we
must be wrapped in manie miseries, and we cease not to offend
God, being so weak as we be. S. Paule is then sorie, that
he must liue so long in offending God, and this kinde of desire
is good and holie, and procéedeth of the holie Ghost.

                  Of foure manner of deaths.
                  Beside the mortall and eternall death, bée other two,
the spirituall death and the temporall death, which be not so
well knowen, nor so soone espied of the simple, as the naturall
and eternall death is. The spirituall death is, when the bodie
is yet liuing, the soule is dead, as the Apostles proueth by the
widdowes that liue at pleasure,1. Tim. 5. 6. béeing aliue in bodie, and yet
dead in soule. The temporall death is, when the affections &
lusts of the bodie, are so killed that the spirit maie liue, wherof
the Apostle speaketh Col. 3.Col. 3. 5. exhorting vs to mortifie our
earthlie members, & to kill all the strength of our corrupt nature
that striue against the spirite. For by obaieng our lustes,
at the first came death into the world, as it appeareth by Eue,
when she eate of the forbidden fruit.

                  How death is not to be feared. Example
of a Panim.
                  
                     I finde that a learned Panim wrote, that we should neither
care for life by it selfe, nor yet for death by it selfe. Hée
saith that we should care to liue well and to die well, and let
life and death passe without care: for life is not good, but to
liue well is good. If Panims haue this right consideration of
life and death, what shame is it for Christen men to care for
death? Seeing Christ whose wordes cannot but be true, so vehementlie
forbiddeth vs the same, that Panims sawe by reason
to be done, &c.

               DEBT.
               
                  How debtes ought to be required, and how not.
                  
                     ESaie
                     Esaie. 58. 3 the Prophet seemeth to account it in the Iewes a great
fault to aske their debt, saieng: Et Omnes debitores repetitis.
Ye chalenge and charge all your debters, ye call all debts
back againe: Whie, is it not lawfull for a good christen man to
cal for his debts. Yea and if neede so require to sue for them by
the lawe? God forbid else, otherwise there could no good order,
no pollicie, no ciuilitie, nor Common wealth endure: If buyeng
and selling, keeping of contracts & couenants were not lawfull,
then all things should be common, then we should liue like
lawlesse beasts, wée needed no king, no maigistrate. But yée
must vnderstand that in a case, charitie will not suffer right, to
call for her debt. The case shall bée this: My brother, my neighbour
is burnt with fire, is lamed of his limmes, is robbed of his
sight, at one word, is so oppressed with pouertie, that he is not
able to paie: In this case charitie will commaunde iustice to
giue place, and not to aske her debt, but rather to giue more of
their owne. The Iewes were so hard hearted that they spared
not, forgaue no debters were they neuer so poore nor so pitifull.
And therefore Esaie layeth it to their charge,Deut. 15. 
                           •
                        
                      saieng: Omnes
debitores vestros repetitis: Ye cal vpon al your debters, as wel
them that be in extreame néede and vnable to paie, as they that
be wealthie and able inough to paie. Beside this, the Iewes had
a certeine ciuill lawe giuen vnto them by God, vnto the which
we now are not bound. The lawe was this: Euerie seauenth
yeare, thou shalt kéepe a frée yeare, or a Iubelie yeare, which
shall be kept after this manner: If ought shall bée owing to anie
man, either from his friend, his neighbour, or his brother,

he maie not aske it againe, because it is the Lords frée yeare, or
the Lords Iubelie yeare. This yeare was also called Sabbatum
terrae: Moses saieng vnto the people on this wise: Sex
annos agrum tuum, &c. Sixe yeares thou shalt sow thy land,
and sixe yeares thou shalt cut thy vineyard, and gather in the
fruite thereof, but the seauenth yeare, shall be a Sabboth of rest
vnto the land. The Lords sabboth it shall bée. The crop that
the ground shall bring foorth by her owne kinde, without thy labour,
that shalt thou not reape: and the crop that shall grow by
their owne kinde, thou shalt not gather, whie? Shall they rotte
vpon the vines, and the grasse and the corne vpon the grounde?
No not so, but the grasse and the corne thou shalt reape, and the
grapes thou shalt not gather: Hoc est non tibi soli ea coacernabis,
neque repones federum tibi cum alijs commune. And vnto
this I saie in the seauenth yeare, Non licet tibi debita exigere.
Now all such debts as were pardoned by Gods commaundement,
in consideration of the Iubelie yeare, the couetous rich
man the next yeare following would require all these debtes of
their poore neighbours, which they were bound vpon writings
made, which we call Deede Obligatorie: now saith Esaie: Dissolue
Colligationes impiae, &c. Cancell thy wicked Obligations:
loose and vndoe the heauie burthens that oppresse thy
neighbour, dispatch and let them goe frée, which are not able
to paie, &c.

paiment, cannot stand in one respect togethers. It ouerthroweth
Popish satisfaction, which (saie they) must be done by pilgrimages,

euill. But in as much as he is peruerse & wicked of his will,
for setting more by himself then by God, he wold not be in subiection
vnto him, but swelling through pride, hée fell from his
chiefe essence and excellent béeing. And againe in his treatise
vpon Iohn. 42. Doest thou demaund from whence the diuell is?
From thence doubtlesse from whence al the other Angels are.
But the other Angels constantlie continued in their obedience,
he by disobedience and pride, fell from an Angell, and became
a diuell.

                  Christ saith that the Diuell hath bene a liar from the beginning.
¶That is to saie, euen from the time he was first a Diuell,
and not from the time he was first made an Angell. And
that when he doth speake lies, he speaketh that which is his
owne. And therefore Christ addeth vnto it, that he did not abide
still in the truth: for he hath nothing of God which is truth, but
that which he now hath of euill, is of himselfe.

dampned. Because thou saist I am a sinner, therefore will I bée
righteous & saued. Naie (saith the diuell) thou shalt be damned.
No (saie I) for I flie vnto Christ, who hath himself suffered for
my sins, therfore Satan thou shalt nothing preuaile against me
in y• thou goest about to terrifie me in setting forth y• greatnes of

my sinnes, and so to bring me into heauinesse, distrust, dispaire,
hatred, contempt, and blaspheming of God: yea rather by this
that thou saist, I am a sinner, thou giuest me armour and weapon
against thy selfe, that with thine owne swoorde I maie cut
thy throate, and treade thée vnder my féet: for Christ dyed for
sinners. Moreouer thou thy selfe preachest vnto me the
glorie of GOD. For thou puttest mée in minde of GODS
fatherlie loue towards me wretched and dampned sinner, who
so loued the world,Iohn. 5. 24. that he gaue his onelie begotten sonne, that
whosoeuer beléeueth in him might not perish but haue euerlasting
life. Also as oft as thou doest obiect that I am a sinner, so
oft thou callest to my remembraunce the benefite of Christ my
redéemer, vpon whose shoulders, and not vpon mine, lie all my
sinnes: for the Lord hath laide all our iniquities vpon him.

                  True deuotion or pure religion,
what it is.
                  TRue deuotion, that is called in latine (Pietas) is that which
hath annexed therewith diuine promises, for this present
life to come, as witnesseth Paule. 1. Tim. 4.
                     1. Tim. 4 which is nothing
els but obseruation of Christs lawe, that in the Psalme for the
purenesse thereof is called siluer fined often and manie times
through fire: It hath no chaffe in it,Psal. 12. 6. as hath mens traditions,
but is pure and cleane wheate? As sheweth Ieremie writing
thus:Iere. 23. 28 What is the chaffe to the Wheate? Therefore beholde,
I will come against the Prophet, saith the Lord, that steale my
word euerie one from his neighbour, and deceiue my people in
their lyes, and in their errours. And this deuotion is that which
Saint Iames calleth the pure religion of Christ, saieng: Pure
and immaculate religion afore God the father is, to visit fatherlesse
children and widdowes in their vexation. Whereby hee
meaneth all needie people that are succourlesse and helplesse,
without councell or other meanes according to our abilitie,
whensoeuer we sée them in néede or distresse.

                  What the Papists call deuotion.
                  What is it, that they call deuotion? Euerie mans owne lyking.
As soone as a man hath a minde to anie thing, by and by
he beareth him in hand, that God is as much delighted therewith,
as he himselfe is. And there is no man but he vndertaketh
some thing or other. Beholde the ouerboldnesse that hath
alwaies reigned in the world, which is, that men will néeds be
maister, and make lawes at their owne pleasures, and GOD
must be faine to accept whatsoeuer they haue forged after that
manner. But contrariwse the holie Ghost telleth vs, that wée
must not lift vp one foote to go forward, but onelie in the waie
which God sheweth vs.

                  From whom popish deuotion sprong.
                  When men thought to serue God after their owne fashion,
and framed lawes for themselues, saieng: This will bée, and
such a thing will bée acceptable vnto God: it was because they
would make him like vnto themselues, as though he delighted
in all the small toyes which they had inuented: That is to wit,
outward things, and so doing, they transformed God, as though
they would pull him out of his heauenly seate, and drawe him
downe hether, or as though hée were a creature, or a fleshlye
thing. For then we see all these fonde deuotions vsed in the papacie,
and tearmed their diuine seruice, sprang of this, namelie
that they knowe not the highnesse of God, for then would they
haue concluded thus: God is not delighted in the things which
séemeth good in our owne eies, for he is of an other nature then
we bee: he is a spirit, and therefore must we serue him after a
cleane contrarie fashion vnto that which pleaseth our nature:
neither must we in this case attempt anie thing of our owne
heades: but haue his lawe, in which he hath declared his will
vnto vs. Hée hath prescribed vs our rule, let vs holde vs to that.
This is the sobrietie which God requireth by his worde, and
wherevnto he would haue vs to submitte our selues without
swaruing anie thing at all there-from.

of those which receiued the Lordes bodie without difference
and careleslie, as if it had bene anie other kinde of meat
whatsoeuer. Heere therefore, if he be reproued which maketh no
difference of the Lordes bodie, that is to saie, doth not discerne

                  How and wherefore married folke maie
be diuorsed.
                  THe same authoritie hath the woman to put awaie the man,
that the man hath to put awaie the woman. Mar. 10. 11. 12.
Christ saith, there is no lawfull cause to dissolue matrimonie,
but adulterie. For when the woman giueth the vse of her bodie
to an other man, shée is no more her first husbandes wife,
nor the husband no longer the husband of his wife, then he obserue
the faith of matrimonie with her. Wheresoeuer the fault
happen and can be proued by certeine signes and lawfull testimonies:
the persons maie by the authoritie of Gods word and
ministrie of the magistrates, be separated so one from the other,
that it shall be lawfull for the man to marrie an other wife, and
the wife to marrie an other husband. And Christ saith. Math. 5.
32. and. 19. 9. So that a man shall not néede to kéepe at home
with him a woman, that is no more his, then an other mans,
neither the woman such an husband, as is no more hirs then an
other womans. Mar. 10. 11. 12. Saint Paule. 1. Cor. 7. 12. sheweth
an other cause of diuorcement, when one of the persons being
married, is an Infidell, and of a contrarie faith. If this person
will not dwell with the other that is his fellowe in matrimonie
and a christen man, it is lawfull to breake the faith of matrimonie
and marrie with an other. So saith Saint Ambrose
writing in the place of S. Paule. Non debetur reuerencia, &c.
The reuerēce of matrimonie is not due vnto him y• contemneth
the author of matrimonie. And in y• same place the contempt of
God, breketh y• right of matrimonie, cōcerning him y• is forsakē,

least he should be accursed béeing married to an other. Thus
thou séest that the Lord, Ma
                           •
                        . 5. and 19. giueth license for adulterie,
to diuorse and marrie againe, & Saint Paule for infidelitie.
Whooper.
                  
                  Christ speaketh expreslie of the man, that he maie for fornication
put awaie his wife: but he sheweth not whether the woman
maie leaue her husbande, if he commit whooredome: the
reason is, because he doth onely answere vnto that was demanded
of him. But if a generall question be moued on this behalfe,
there is a common and a mutuall right of either parte,
euen as there is a mutuall knotte of faith and promise:
otherwise the husbande is the heade of the wife, and the
wife in subiection to her husband. But as farre foorth as perteineth
vnto chastitie of matrimonie, and to the faithfulnesse of
the bed, the like lawe is prescribed vnto the wife. The man
saith Saint Paule, hath no power ouer his owne bodie, but the
wife: neither hath the woman power of hir owne bodie, but
the man. There is like libertie therefore if the husband or wife
doe violate the promise of the bed, the chast wife maie forsake
her husband, if he bee a fornicatour, as wel as the husband maie
put awaie his wife, if shée haue plaied the whoore.
Marl. fol. 420.
                  
                  It is said,Mat. 5. 31. whosoeuer putteth awaie his wife, lette him giue
her a letter of diuorcement. ¶These words doe perteine to the
lawe of eschewing adulterie, and doe teach that truelie and
vndefiledly we ought to keepe the faith of wedlocke. For euen as
the Iewes thought that they behaued themselues falsely and amisse
before God, if they kéepe not the lawe after a politike order.
Euen so againe, whatsoeuer the politike or morall lawe
did not prohibite, they fondlie imagined that it was at their plesure.
Moses in respect of the externall order, did not forbidde the
diuorsements with their wiues (which wer wōt to be obserued)
but onelie to take awaie the occasion of lust, for it was a certeine
testimonie of man

                     mission of frée libertie, that euer after
the woman might be frée from the bondage and power of the
man: and also the man by the same, did acknowledge and confesse,
that he did not put awaie his wife for anie crime or fault,
but because the did not please him.

                  How the Bill of diuorcement was made.
                  Some write that the Bill of Diuorcement mencioned
in the fift of Mathewe, was made after this forme following,
as should appeare by a copie taken out of the lawe of
the Hebrues.
                  This Bill made the 29.Bill of diuorcemēt daie of Iune in the yeare of the creation
of the world 5030. witnesseth that I H. K. the sonne of
W. K. dwelling in the citie of London, haue well aduised my
self, no man constraining me, and haue dimist, and set at libertie,
and left thée A. K. to thy self, which hast bene héeretofore my
wife, and nowe hauing dimist thée, and set thée frée, I giue the
leaue to do what thou wilt, & to go and giue thy selfe to wife, to
whom so euer it shal please thée. In witnes wherof I giue vnto
thée this Bill of diuorcement & dimissorie Epistle, beeing an instrument
of libertie according to y• law of Moses. Marl. fol. 102.
                  
               
               
                  Whie the Iewes were suffered to be diuorced.
                  The Iewes were suffered by the lawe (for their weaknesse
sake) to be diuorced from their wiues (giuing them a Testimoniall
in their hands) to auoide a further inconuenience, y• was,
least when they were moued or angrie with them, they would
either haue poisoned or killed them.
               
               
                  The meaning of these places following.
                  Whosoeuer marrieth her,Luk 16. 18 that is put awaie from her husband,
committeth adulterie. ¶They that gather by this place
that a man cannot be married againe after he hath putte awaie
his wife for adulterie while she liueth, reson fondlie. For Christ
speaketh of these diuorses which the Iewes vsed, of which sort
we cannot take the diuorcement for adulterie, for adulterers
were put to death by the lawe.
                  Let not man therefore put a sunder that which God hath
coupled together.Mat. 19. 6 ¶He that putteth awaie his wife for adulterie
or fornication, doth not put asunder that which God hath
coupled: for it is GOD himselfe (which commaundeth such to
be stoned to death) that doth separate them.

well done.
                  THou shalt not doe that which is good in thine owne eies,
but doe that onelie which I commaund thee. ¶Upon this
place Saint Iohn Chrisostome in his Oration against the
Iewes, saith thus: Of a truth that which is done according to
the will of God, although it seeme to be wicked: yet it is altogether
pleasant and acceptable before God. Contrariwise,
whatsoeuer is done beside the word of GOD, and otherwise
then he wil haue it done, though it be as a thing acceptable to
God, yet it is of all other the worst and most wicked.

                  How the doers of the lawe are iustified.
                  For before God they are not righteous which heare the
lawe,Rom. 2. 13 but the doers of the lawe shall be iustified. ¶That is,
shall be pronounced iust and righteous. This sentence is onely
spoken to the rebuke of the Iewes, setting no small store by
themselues in that behalfe of the lawe, which yet they kept not.
This thing laieth Paule to their charge on this wise: It is not
inough for thée, O thou Iewe, to heare the law onelie, & to be
a professour therof and a leaner vnto it, but if thou wilt needs
be iustified and made righteous in the sight of God by the law,
as thou so greatlie crakest, then must thou kéepe the lawe, not
onelie heare it, now, that doest thou not, out art guiltie of the
breaking of it, and therefore must thou haue an other waie to
become righteous in the sight of God, then by the keeping of the
lawe, which is as this whole Epistle doth after and before
plainlie proue, faith, that fastlie beleeueth sinnes to be forgiuen
fréelie by Christ, not for our workes or deseruinges, no not
whē we haue done the best y• we can. And to this purpose doth
Saint Ambrose writing on this selfe text, expound Paule, saieng:
Not they are righteous which heare the lawe, but which
beléeue in Christ, whome the lawe promised, affirming plainlie,
that to beléeue in him, is to doe the lawe.
Tindale.
                  
                  
                     The Apostle in this place goeth about to rifell the foolishnesse
of the Iewes, which supposed that the hearing and vnderstanding
of the lawe was sufficient to the accomplishing of the
same, although they in no part fulfilled it, which Saint Paule
héere confuteth, as though he would saie vnto them: You bragge
that you are iustified by the lawe, where in no part ye doe fulfill
the lawe, but bragging of a little superficiall vnderstanding
of the lawe, perswade your selues straight, that you doe fulfill
the lawe, as though the accomplishing of the lawe consisted in
knowledge and vnder standing, and not in fulfilling: but heerein
you are deceiued, for not the heares but the dooers of the
law are instified. And because none fullie accomplisheth the law
so absolutelie as Gods iustice requireth therefore our iustification
commeth not by the lawe (where of the Iewes brag

thus: Nam perfecto, &c. for Christ is the fulfilling of the

our authors, which did not choose of their own braines what they

sendeth his shéepe, warning them not onelie to be single and
pure in their doctrine, but also wise and circumspect, and to beware
of men, for they shuld bring them before Iudges & kings

                  An exposition of these places following.
                  I Haue set a doore open before thée.Apoc. 3. 8. ¶Paule glorieth that a
doore was open vnto him. 2. Cor. 2. 12. that is to saie, that occasion
was giuen him by God, wherby to enter into the hearts
of the heathen by the word of the Gospell. In this wise must
this present place be taken: namely, y• Christ had opened a way,
whereby the Church of Philodelphia might allure other churches
to the faith of Christ, by her owne example, howe much
so euer their aduersaries brabled against them, whether they
were Iewes or Gentiles, or false Apostles. And therefore by
saieng, and no man can shutte it, his meaning is this: namely,
no man shall be able to 
                        •
                     et you, but that you shall preferre my
Gospell to manie. So at this daie there is a great doore set open
vnto Gods seruaunts, while the Antichrists and persecutors
burst a sunder: that is to saie, the waie is opened for them,
to enlarge the bounds of Christes kingdome by preaching his
worde, and to beate downe the grose errours of vngodlinesse by
the brightnesse of the Gospell. Because that when God determineth
to enlarge the borders at Christs Kingdome, there is
no power so high that is able to let it.

Doores béeing, as a man might saie: late in the euening,
and at that time that the Gates and Doores be wont to be
shut. Or els could not Christ our sauiour, through his diuine
power cause the doores (were they neuer so surelie shut to open

                  ¶Whereas some thinke that doores were opened for him,
that he might enter in according to the manner of men, it disagréeth
much with the minde of the Euangelist. Therefore
we must not thinke that Christ entered in without myracle, to
the ende he might declare his diuine power to make his Disciples
the more attentiue. Neuerthelesse that is most false
which the Papists doe affirme, as that Christs bodie pearc

                     rein the
same. But the wordes of the Euangelist sound no such thing:
because he saide not that he entered through the doores that
were shut, but that he stoode sodeinlie in the middest of his disciples
when the doores were shut: we know that Peter came
foorth of the fast barred prison, shall we therefore saie that hée
pearsed through the midst of the yron Gates? This were too
absurde and childish. Let vs content our selues with this, that
Christ purposed by a notable miracle to confirme the Apostles
in the fayth of his resurrection.

                  Of the doubting of Abraham & other
holie persons.
                  WHether Abraham anie thing doubted, when God promised
to him a childe, the Scripture séemeth to leaue in suspence.
For in the 12. of Genesis, it is written that he laughed & said:
Shall a childe be borne vnto me of an hundred yeares of age?
And shall Sara bring forth a childe being 90 yeares of age? I
would to God Ismael might liue in thy sight. These words haue
a showe both of ioie and admiration being ioined notwithstanding
with some doubting. And this Scripture therfore maketh
mentiō of these things, y• the faith of Abraham which is so highlie
cōmended, shuld in no wise be thought to haue bene without
doubting, which are accustomed to spring of the flesh & humane
sence: but because the faith of the Patriarke ouercame those
doubtings, therefore it is praised. Neither do we read there, that
Abraham was accused of incredulitie as Sara was, which also
laughed. And if a man weigh the outwa
                        •
                     d laughter, they were
both alike. But God which is the searcher of the hearts, vnderstood
right well the faith of either of them. Holie men, although
they beleeued the promises of God, yet sometime through humane
weaknesse, they somewhat doubted, and therefore it came
to passe oftentimes, that they required signes and miracles to
confirme their weaknesse, which thing we read in Gedeon and
Ezechias the King. But in this place is shewed a remedie

against such temptations, namelie to call backe our thoughtes
from humane lets, and to fixe our eies onelie vpon the power of
God. Of this thing the Angell admonished the blessed Uirgin
saieng: No word is impossible with God, although it appeared
not by the words of the Uirgin that she doubted, but onelie
asked how that should come to passe: for she doubted not,
but as the Angell had tolde hir she should conceiue, and that
straight waie: but because she sawe, that she was not as yet
coupled in Matrimonie, although she were betrouthed, she demaunded
how that should come to passe. Therefore the Angell
in his aunswere comprehended two principall points. The
one is, whereby he remooued awaie doubting, if peraduenture
there stucke anie thing in the minde of the Uirgin. For he said,
No word is impossible with God. The second is of the maner
of conceiuing, The Holie ghost (saith he) shall come vpon thée,
and the power of the most highest shall shaddowe thée. But
whereas some faine, that she asked this, because she had vowed
virginitie to God, it néedeth no long confutation, especiallie seeing
wée are by the Historie it selfe taught, that shee was betrothed
to a man, neither was there at that time anie such
custome to vowe Uirginitie.

toward Christ. For ye father giueth faith to whō he will:
& on whom he wil he hath mercie, & whom he will also, he maketh

hard hearted. It is no violent manner of drawing which
draweth a man with externall haling and pulling, of the which
our Sauiour speaketh héere: and yet notwithstanding the motion
of the Holie ghost is so effectuall, that it maketh men willing
in despite of flesh and bloud. Wherefore that is false and
prophane which some saie, that no man is drawen against his
will: as though a man were obedient to God by his owne motion
& will. For in that men willinglie obaie God, it commeth
of him who frameth their hearts to his obedience. Therefore
mans free will is nothing.

his wine, and being awaked, and remembring the wicked
act that he had committed, he was so ashamed and sorie, that he
wished himselfe dead. But yet he amended not the vice of dronkennesse.
Yea once afterward he dronke so much wine in one
night that he fell into a Feuer, and for that he would not temper
himselfe from wine, within a while after he died.

When as he hauing dronke more wine then was méete,
laie in the Tabernacle most filthelie naked, and his priuie
partes which were wont to be couered, he lefte bare and vncouered:

the other two sonnes of a better and holier nature, were sorie
and verie much ashamed of their fathers filthinesse. By this
act it is sufficientlie declared, that shame, derision and offence, folowe
Dronkennesse. But of this sinne we haue a notable example
in Lot,
                     Lot. who vndoubtedlie dranke not immoderatelie,
to the ende he would abuse his Daughters, and to commit
incest, but to put awaie care and griefes which he had taken for
the ouerthrow of the 5 cities, for the losse of his deere wife, and
also of his substance. He would also comfort his daughters, that
they should not take too much thought, speciallie 
                        •
                     or the losse of
their mother: although he ought to haue inuented other waies
of comforting. But this I speake onelie least that anie man
shoulde thinke, that he didde with hi
                        •
                      will drinke too much,

to pollute himselfe with most filthie lusts: yet for all that, to
                        •
                     
much abundaunce of drinke, was the cause of his most vile incest,
being otherwise an olde man, & in a time farre out of purpose,
for as much as the iudgements of God were declared against
the filthie lusts of the 5. Cities. And which is wonderful,
wine so alienated Lot from himself, that he vnderstood not with
what women he had companied. Wherefore rightlie saith Seneca
                     Seneca
in his 84. Epistle: They which are dronken, doe manie
things, which afterward when they are sober, they are ashamed
of. Lot sought to make himselfe merrie with wine, and he incurred
a perpetuall heauinesse. Let them therefore which séeke
to be made merrie with wine, remember that they put themselues
in a most present daunger, and by that meanes maie easelie
throwe themselues headlong, into most grieuous wicked
actes.

Tower, gallantlie garnished with the Eies, which Nature

by the premission and ordinaunce of God haue set in a pretie
valley, compassed about with the bulwarke of the strong and
hardie rocke of the forhead, couered with fine, soft & close windowes,
which we call the Eie liddes. In Latine they be called
Cilia quasi caelia caelando, of ciling or couering the eies. Vnderneath
is set as it were a little Mount, which we call the
ball of the cheeke, and all this is for the defence and sauegard of
the Eie, which if he stood open in a flat plaine place, as it standeth
in a round valley, it should euer be in daunger to be hurt,
where now, it is so on euerie side defended, that no rush nor
knocke can lightlie hurt it. Beside all this, the apple of ye Eie,

our destruction. God I saie hath created our Eies. To what
ende? To the ende that whiles we be in this world, we should
haue abilitie to discerne betwéen things, & that the same might
lead vs vnto him, whether we looke vpward or downward, do
we not sée that our Lord calleth vs vnto himselfe? Are not all
the creatures both in heauen and earth, meanes to allure vs
to come to God? Then doth he not onelie saie, come vnto me:
but he draweth vs thether by his goodnesse, according as we see,
he sheweth himselfe liberallie towards vs, and thereby ministreth
occasion to vs to walke in his feare. Thus ye sée, to what
ende our eies were made. For if we had no eies, we should
not haue such meanes to beholde Gods glorie in all points as
we haue.

His eies also is sometime taken for his fauour. As the eies of

                  Of the nature of Eagles.
                  AS concerning the nature of Eagles, it maie be taken, that
their young ones doe sucke bloud anone after they be vnclosed,Iob. 39 30.
because that one kinde of Eagles do cast their young ones
out of the neast, so as they be driuen to shifte for themselues, &
it is said that they bring vp none but the blacke ones: howbeit,

bastards, if their sight be not strong inough to looke vppon the

                      The comparison
of the Eagles gaue the Iewes occasion to forge fables.Psa. 103. 5
For whereas they vnderstood not the principles of anie science
at all, yet are they so brasen faced, that what matter soeuer is
intreated of, they neuer make bones in it, and so soone as

they méete with anie vncouth thing, there is not anie so péeuish
a forgerie, which they threape not vpon men as an Oracle
from God. So in this place they surmise, that euerie tenth
yeare, the Eagles flie vp to the Elementall fire, and afterward
plunge themselues in the Sea, and than by and by new
feathers growe vp againe. But the plaine meaning of the
Prophet is picked out of the nature of the Eagle, described by
the Philosophers, as which is throughlie knowen by experience.
For that foule is faire and well liking vnto hir old age,
and is not efféebled by yeares, nor subiect to diseases, till at the
length she die for hunger. Certaine it is that she liueth long:
but at the length hir beake ouergroweth, so as she cannot receiue
meate, but onelie is faine to sucke in the bloud of it, or
els to refresh-hir selfe with drinking, wherevpon came the
Prouerbe: An Eagles olde age for necessitie, compelleth him
to be euer bibling. And because drinke alone is not enough to
maintaine life, they rather pine awaie for hunger and want
of foode, then decaie for want of strength. Now without anie
fable, we perceiue the naturall meaning of the Prophet. That
like as Eagles continue alwaies lustie and in good plight, so
as they be youthfull euen in their olde age: euen so the godlie
are sustained by the secret power of God, so that they receiue
their strength still vnappaired.
Cal. vpon the Psal.
                  
                  ¶As the Eagle when her beake ouergroweth sucketh bloud,
and so is renued in strength: euen so God, miraculouslie giueth
strength to his Church, aboue all mens expectation.

                  For wheresoeuer a dead Carkasse is, euen thether also will
the Eagles be gathered together.Ma. 24. 28 ¶There are diuers kindes of
Eagles, among which one is of the Uultures kind, excelling
the rest in bignesse. And the Uultures (which Writers doe
witnesse) doe flie two or thrée daies before, to the place where
the carkasse shall be.Iob. 39. 30 And Iob of the Eagle saith; where anie
dead bodie lieth, there is he immediatelie. It is likelie that the
common Prouerbe arose of this kinde of Eagles. Marlorate
in expounding this place at the full, maketh this conclusion in
the ende: Moreouer (saith he) their reason is nothing sure or
effectuall, which vpon this place saie, that the death of Christ
was so effectuall, that it allured the elect and chosen of God.

For it was rather the purpose of Christ, to bring an argument
from ye lesse to the more, as thus: If ther be such wit in Birds,
that manie of them, will come from farre to one Carkasse. It
is a great shame to the faithfull, not to be gathered to the Authour
of life, by whom onelie they are trulie sed.

Elders or Priests, it is all one to me, so that ye vnderstande

                  What the cause of our Election is, and
how it is defined.

will, through faith in Christ his sonne, chusing and preferring
to life such as pleaseth him.
Bradford in the booke of Mar.
                  
                  The onelie good pleasure of the will and franke mercie of
God by Iesus Christ without respect of anie works, either present
or for to come, is the cause of the diuine Election.
F. N. B. the Italian.
                  
                  
                     The cause of our election is onelie the will of God. And to
proue this, Saint Paule saith (which sawe as farre in mens deseruings
as we can doe) bringeth in an euident example of Iacob
and Esau, how Iacob was elected and Esau reproued, before
they were borne, or had done either good or bad. To the which
some will saie, that God sawe afore that Iacob should bée good,
and therefore chose him, and that Esau should doe no good, and
therefore repelled him. But to those that will iudge of that that
God sawe, it maie be demaunded how they knowe that GOD
sawe that, and if he sawe it, yet how knowe they that that was
the cause of Iacobs election? Saint Paule knoweth none other
cause but the will of God, whatsoeuer other discusse. And if they
should saie the cause whie God sawe before that Iacob shoulde
doe good, was because that God would giue him his grace, therfore
God sawe that he should doe good, and so shoulde also the
other haue done, if God would haue giuen him that same grace.
Saint Paule concluding with these Scriptures, saith:
I will shewe mercie to whome I shew mercie, and will
haue compassion on whome I haue compassion, So lyeth
it not in mans will and running, but in the mercie of God.
He saith not, I will haue mercie on him that I sée shall do good,
but I will shew mercie to whom I will. He sayth not, I will
haue compassion on him that shall deserue it, De congrua, but
of him, of whom I will haue compassion. This doth Austen wel
proue in these wordes: The disputation of them is vaine, the
which do defend the prescience of God, against the grace of God,
and therfore saie that we were chosen before the making of the
world, because that God knew afore that we shuld bée good, because
he shoulde make vs good. But he that saith, you haue
not chosen me saith not so, for if he did therefore choose vs, because
that before he knew that we should be good, then must hée
also haue knowne before, that we should first haue chosen him.
Héere it is plaine, that the election of God is not because he saw
afore, that we should doe well. But onelie the cause of the election,
is his mercie, and the cause of our dooing well is his election.
And therefore Saint Paule saith, not of workes but of calling.
I. Veron.
                  
                  So then election is not of the willer,Rom. 9. 16. but of God that taketh
mercie. ¶It is euident by this Text, that our works or merites

doe not iustifie vs, but that our saluation doth wholie depend
vpon the frée election of GOD, which béeing righteousnesse
it selfe, doth choose whome it pleaseth him vnto lyfe euerlasting.
Sir I. Cheeke.
                  
                  Blessed are the people whome the Lorde hath chosen to bée
his inheritaunce,Psa. 34. 12 &c. ¶Of the Lordes frée election and choosing
of his Citizens, whome he hath predestinate and appointed to
be saued, the Scripture both in the olde and newe Testament
speaketh much. In the 20. of Saint Mathew, verse 16. our sauiour
saith: Multi vocati, pauci vero electi
                           •
                        
                      Manie bée called,
but fewe bée chosen. All they bée called which haue had the
word of GOD preached vnto them. And they onelie are elect,
which finallie and eternallie shall be saued, and inherit the euerlasting
kingdome with Iesus Christ the first begotten, and the
onelie purchaser of lyfe eternall. The elect haue these properties
and blessings of GOD following them: Though they doe
fall and sinne of tentimes, yea and peraduenture verie gréeuouslie
as Dauid did: or committing as Saint Peter did with his
denieng and forswearing of CHRIST: As Marie Magdalene
and the woman of Samarie did, with their fraile and
foolish yéelding vnto the pleasure of the flesh, yet they neuer
fall from GOD, but their grose and naturall falles, doe cast
them into such a shame of themselues and abhorring of sinnes,
that by their falling they rise vp the more stronger. So that the
elect cannot finallie bée seduced nor carried awaie from GOD.
For whome Christ loueth, In finem diligit, hée loueth surelye
vnto the verie end. Neque rapere eos de manu ei
                           •
                        s quisque
potest. No creature can plucke out of Christs handes his elect
seruaunts, and no meruaile, for the purpose of Gods election is
sure. The elect vnto saluation was chosen before they were
borne, and before they did either good or badde, as Saint Paule
witnesseth, prouing this example true, by Iacob and Esau the
sonnes of Rebecca, and as it was in those two bretheren (sayth
Saint Paule) so was it in all men before they were borne, hauing
done neither good nor euill. The one was an elect person,
and the other a man reprobate, according as it is written, Iacob
dilexi, Esau autem odio habui, Iacob haue I loued, Esau
haue I hated. All this was done saith Saint Paule, to the ende

that all men might knowe, that the frée election and choosing
of God vnto saluation, standeth vpon his predestinate purpose,
and not vpon our good workes, or our good déedes which wée
doe, after that we beléeue and liue in this world. For God before
the foundation of the world was laid, had predestinate and
appointed all the elect to be saued, and all the reprobate persons,
God did fore-sée and fore-knowe, that they should be dampned.
But then it might be obiected thus: If the saluation of man do
rest vpon Gods election, what fault is there in man, though hée
be dampned, is not the fault in God? To this Saint Paule aunswereth
and saith roundlie: Absit, GOD forbid that anie man
should so thinke, but yet I will haue no man to controll mee:
for vnto Moses it was sayd: I will shewe mercie vnto whom
it pleaseth me: Therefore let all men sette their heartes at
rest, sayth the Apostle, Quia non est volentis neque currentis,
sed in Dei miserentis. For it is not in the power of the well
willer, nor in the swift runner, but in the power of GOD that
mercie sheweth. But thou wilt peraduenture saie, whie doth
GOD blame vs, if we bée not saued, séeing no man is able to
resist his will and his knowledge. Héere the Apostle once againe,
biddeth euerie man to stoppe, and in no wise to enter into
such disputation with GOD, saith: O homo quis es qui
respondes Deo, numquid dicit figmentum ei qui se finzit, quid
me fecisti sic? Therefore O thou vaine man stop in this matter
betimes, and be not too bolde after such manner to dispute
with God, Thou wilt then saie, what profite can come to one
of vs the laie people, by speaking or preaching of Gods election,
it séemeth to be a perillous matter to be talked of: no not so,
doe not thou call that perillous which the holie Ghost hath ordeined
for thy comfort and singular profite, if thou béest of God:
marie if thou beest of the Diuell, it shall bring thée either to
desperation that thou art not elect, and therefore thou must
needs be dampned, or else to presumption that thou art elect, and
therefore doe what thou wilt thou must néedes bée saued.
                  But if thou bée of GOD, thou shalt take two greate benefits,
the one is this: Where the propertie (euen of the best of vs all)
is to be tickled with vaine glorie and pride, and are alwayes
readie to aduaunce our owne good workes. This did I, & thus

and thus. To plucke awaie this pride, this vaine glorie, and reioising
in our selues, & to make vs wholie to humble our selues
vnto God, there is no such thing, as to saie vnto our selues: It
is neither in the power of the well willer, nor in the swift runner,
but in the power of God & mercie shewer. This is a great
profite and necessarie lesson to be taught. An other to be learned
of Gods election is this. That in God there is most high
prouidence for the gouernement of the worlde, seeing that hee
hath foreseene and forecast all things, before the foundation of
the world was laide, there can no man then accuse God of negligence:
nor againe there néedeth no man to practise any euill
craft to get a liuing, séeing God forgetteth no bodie, nor leaueth
none of his vnprouided for: so that we haue all then good cause
to reioice with the Prophet and saie: Blessed be those people
whom the Lord hath chosen to be his inheritance. As who shuld
saie: by the prouidence and free election of God, saluation commeth
to men.

thus: I doe the euill that I would not doe, & I doe not the good
that I would doe, wo is me, who shall deliuer me out of the bodie

gospell preached vnto vs, or to make our praier to God, for to

                  If we haue a good peece of ground, which we knowe most
perfectlie to be fruitfull, would we not till it still and sowe it,
that we maie haue some profite of it, or wold we let it lie alone,
because we knowe it to be fruitfull: Euen so the elect & chosen
are as it were plowed and tilled, and good seedes still cast into
their heartes, that they maie bring foorth good and pleasant fruit
vnto the Lord. Againe, If we goe about that the true elect and
chosen of God, haue no néede of the preaching of Gods worde,

because they bée sure alreadie of their saluation: we maie also
mainteine and vpholde, that we haue no néede of meate and
drinke, sith that we be assured by Gods word, that we shall not
die before the time that God hath appointed. Christ was sure
of his saluation, and yet continued all night in praier.

                        ssians,
some that did worshippe these Elements as Gods, and desired
health and saluation of them, putting trust and confidence in
them, praieng to them, and desiring of them prosperous things,
and of the disposition of these Elements prophesied thinges to
come: The Apostle heere biddeth them beware they phantasie
no such thing by these Elements which are no Gods, nor are
not to be worshipped as God, but as the creatures of GOD,
made and ordeined for the behalfe and commoditie of man in
this world. Other vnderstand by Elementa mundi, the ceremoniall
and iudiciall lawes of the olde Testament, thinking them
to be necessarie for saluation, and that none could bée saued without
the obseruing of them, as some thought. Act 15 
                           •
                        
                      and among
the Galathians. 4 9. But Peter and Iames, and the residue of
the Apostles of Christ, thought legall ceremonies and sacrifices
not necessarie for saluation, but saluation might well bée
had without them, yea, and without all ceremonies, for ceremonies
now vsed in the Church, bée no holie thinges of themselues,
they make no man holie, they be no workers nor works
of saluation. They be ordeined to signifie and represent other
thinges signified by them. And heere the Apostle biddeth them
beware of such as did call them to the lawe, & not to Christ, to
the ceremonies and workes of the lawe, and of man decréede,
and not of God commaunded: And héere hée willeth them to
beware, of all them that exhort men to ceremonies, olde customes,
voluntarie workes, lawes, statutes, decrees, traditions
of men, rather then Gods commaundements.

                     Elias (when he was carried vp in the
firie Chariot) lefte to his Disciple Elizeus his mantell of
Sheepe skinnes: but the sonne of GOD when he ascended,
left vs his flesh. But Elias put off his mantell: and Christ
hath lefte his flesh with vs, and ascended, hauing it with
him.

                     Chrisostome sheweth in what sorte Christ hath both taken
vp his flesh into heauen, and also left the same amonge the
faythfull in the earth, and in the end compareth Elias and Christ
together. The storie is knowne that when Elias was taken vp
in a firie Chariot, he lette downe his coate vnto Elizens that
stood beneath, who tooke it vp, and by the power of the same diuided
the water of Iordane. Upon occasion heereof Chrisostome
saith: Elizeus receiued the coate made of Sheepe skinnes, as a
greate inheritaunce more precious then anie golde. After that
time Elias was double, for there was Elias aboue 
                        •
                      and Elias beneath.
Aboue was the verie true Elias in the naturall substaunce
and presence of a bodie: beneath was nothing else but
Elias coate, which coate notwithstanding because of the powers

that were wrought with it, he called Elias. Thus Chrisostome
compareth Elias with Christ, and Elias coate with the Sacrament.
And this he saith, Christ is aboue, and Christ is beneath,
as he saith, Elias is aboue, and Elias is beneath. For as Elias
coate was called Elias, euen so the Scarament of Christs bodie
is called Christs bodie.

                  THe Prophet had a speciall warrant by Gods especiall reueling,4 Re. 6. 32
so to bid them, and therefore the Prophet did nothing amisse
therein, &c. The cause whereof (saith Lyra) is annexed: for
beholde the sound of his maisters féete is after him, for after the
departure of the messenger, Ioram repented, and therefore hée
followed him, to reuoke the precept. And saith Caitane, that thou
shouldest boldlie resist the kings messenger, he foretelleth them,
that the king followed his messenger, repenting ye he sent him,
and therfore the king followed the messenger, because he repented
that he had commanded, that Elizeus head shuld be cut off, for
he came to himselfe againe, & came personallie to moue his complaint
before Elizeus.

the Tribe of Leui, yet she might be Maries cosin. For wheras
it was forbidden by the lawe, for maidens to bée married to
men of other Tribes, this coulde not let, but that the Leuies
might take them wiues, out of anie Tribe, for the Leuites had
no portion allowed them when the land was diuided among the
people.
                  ¶Notwithstanding ye 
                     Elizabeth was married to one of the
Tribe of Leui, yet she was Maries cousin which was of the
stocke of Dauid. For the lawe which forbadde marriage out of
their owne Tribe, was onelie that the Tribes should not bée
mixt and confounded, which could not be in marrieng with the
Leuites, for they had no portion assigned vnto them.

For armed men fight against them, and take them from them.

not onelie greene of his owne nature, but hée maketh all the
aire about him to seeme gréene also. Of this condition was
Ieremie and Paule, which hauing the doctrine of lyfe, spared
not to minister it vnto others, for their eternall refreshing,
these with such other throwne into the foundation of the church
were verie comfortable vnto other. With the holie (saith Dauid)

girded together the inward coate.

it was made of Purple, Uiolet coulour, Silke, and Scarlet, it
had gold wrought in it, & sundrie kinds of most precious stones.
There was also an other, which was called Ephod bad, that is,
a linnen Ephod, which the Leuites vsed in holie seruice.

                  Whie it is thought, not to be Saint Paules.
                  THe Epistle which beareth the title to the Hebrues, is not
thought to be his, for the difference if the stile and phrase,
but either iudge it to be written of Timothie, as Tertulian supposeth,
or of Saint Luke as other doe thinke, or else of Clement,
afterwarde Bishoppe of Rome, who as they saye was
adioined with Paule, and coupling together his songes and sentences,
did phrase them in his stile and manner. Or else as
some doe iudge, because S. Paule wrote to the Hebrues, for the
odiousnesse of his name among that people, therefore he dissembled
and suppressed his name in the first entrie of his salutation,
contrarie to his accustomed condition. And as hée wrote
to the Hebrues, he béeing an Hebrue, so he wrote in Hebrue, ye
is in his owne tongue, more eloquentlye, and that is thought to
be the cause whie it differeth from his other Epistles, & is after

a more eloquent manner translated into the Gréeke, then his
other Epistles bée. Some also reade the Epistle written to
Laodicia, but that is explosed of all men. Thus farre Saint
Hierome.

it is, that wée must beware of poison, and praie to GOD to

wée thinke it too high, and too darke for vs: but it behooueth

               EARTH.
               
                  How it is founded vpon the Seas.
                  IT is the propertie of all wise men,Mat. 7. 27 as it maie plainlie appeare
by the wordes of our Sauiour in the Gospell of
Saint Mathewe, that when they shall goe about to builde anie
stronge house, they will bée sure that the foundation shall
bée laide, not vpon sande or muddie myre, but vppon a rocke
or some other sure or stedfast grounde, knowing that otherwise
all their labour and cost, commeth shortlie to naught, whilest
either the violence of the winde or the waues of the hudge
floude, doe rush against that house, and breake it downe. Séeing
then that this is the right propertie of all substantial, wise,
and politike builders: What a wonderfutl paradoxe and inopinable
sentence is this, to saye: Qui ipse fundauit, &c.
                  
                  The Lorde himselfe (the fountaine of all) hath founded the
whole earth, that is so hudge and heauie a thing, vppon the
wauering waters and flowing floudes. These bée the
wordes of the Prophet. Super maria fundauit eam, & super
flumina preperauit eam. Or as Saint Hierome readeth,
Super flumina stabiliuit eam. Upon the Seas, he hath founded
the whole earth, and vpon the floudes he hath stablished it. This
sentence cannot but séeme to the iudgement of all men, a meruailous
straunge and wonderfull saieng, the earth to be founded

vpon the water. Naturall reason will lead a man to say,
that God hath founded the sea vppon the earth, and not the
earth vpon the water: Nam terra aquae stabilimentum est, non
aqua terrae. For of the foure Elements, the Fire, the Aire, the
water, and the earth, the Orbe of the fire is the highest, & couereth
the earth round about: the Aire likewise ought by natural
cōsent to couer ye water round about, & the water the earth.
Wherefore then it followeth by good reason, that earth beeing
the heauiest and lowest of all the foure Elements, and next
vnder the water, it ought therefore to be called the foundation
of the waters (because the waters doe lie vpon the earth) and
not the waters the foundation of the earth. This reason is
so strong, that no naturall wit can be able to impugne it. Againe
in the 104. Psalme, the Prophet saith, That the Lorde
hath founded the earth vpon his owne weight and stablenesse,
Fundasti terram super stabilitatem tuam & non inclinabitur
in seculum seculi. Ouid the Poet saith in like manner: Tellus
pōderatū librata suis. The earth is staied & paised by meanes
of his owne weight, he saith not that the earth is founded, and
yet the Prophet saith: Dominus super maria fundauit orbem
terrae, & super flumina stabiliuit eam. The Lord hath founded
the whole earth vpon the Seas, and vppon the floudes hée stablished
it. Yée shall vnderstand therefore by the order of naturall
reason, the earth like as it is the lowest of all the foure
Elements, and next vnder the water, so it ought to be altogether
couered with water, and vnderneath the water. But ye almightie
and most mightie creatour of all things, by his myraculous
and his diuine power, hath altered the order generall,
and hath made a lawe and a statute peculiar, which is this:
That the waters shall not ouerflow the whole earth, but to be
contented with a portion of the earth to dwell vpon, & to get
them into a corner, & in no wise so hardie their heads to passe
their bounds & limits appointed. This statute was made vppon
the third daie after the creation of the world, as we reade
in Gen. 1. Chapter on this wise. Congregantur aquae sub
coelo sunt in locum vnum, & appareat arida. Let the waters
that be vnder Heauen, be gathered together into one
place, that the drie lande maie appeare. And by this peculiar
commaundement of God, in the which the Philosopher béeing

ignoraunt, and séeing such a miraculous worke aboue Nature,
be called it Natura particularis. Now ye must note, that
forasmuch as this peculiar order that God hath established betweene
the waters and the drie lande, the Earth is exalted aboue
the waters, euen as farre as the walles of an house are aboue
the foundation. In consideration of this miraculous worke
of God, the earth is héere said by ye Prophet to be builded partlie
vpon the salt Seas, & partlie vpon the fresh floudes, because
the earth is so wonderfullie exalted in euerie place aboue the
waters, euen as far as the walls of an house is aboue the foundation,
and not that the water is absolutelie the foundation or
the piller of the Earth.

               EARTHQVAKE.
               
                  How Earthquakes doe come.
                  AN Earthquake is a shaking of the earth, which is caused by
meanes of winde and exhalations that be inclosed within the
caues of the earth, and can finde no passage to breake foorth, or
els so narrow a waie, that it cannot be soone enough deliuered.
Wherefore with great force and violence it breaketh foorth, and
one while shaketh the earth, and another while rendeth and cleaueth
the same, sometime it casteth vp the earth a great height into
the aire, and sometime it causeth the same to sinke a great
depth down, swallowing both Cities and Townes, yea and also
mightie great Mountaines, leauing in the place where they
stoode, nothing but great holes of an vnknown depth, or els great
lakes of water.

                     Aristotle the great and the learned Philosopher, disputeth of
Earthquakes in the 5. booke of his Mute. And holdeth opinion
that y• cause efficient of Earthquakes be winde inclosed within
the caues & hollow places of the earth. And the materiall cause
he iudgeth to be Exhalations hot and drie. Other of the most
auncient and great Philosophers, be of a cleane contrarie opinion,
which is this: That Earthquakes doe come with the vehement
pushes and beatings of great waters, that be crept in at
the caues of the earth, & afterward doe séeke a waie out, which
when they cannot finde, the waters violently enclosed, beating
and rolling vp and downe within the earth, doth cause earthquakes,
but it is to be thought that the thirde opinion, which

                     A. G. li. 2. cap. 10
                           •
                        
                      seemeth to allowe, is better and a more wiser
opinion (no dispraise nor displeasure to Aristotle) then either of
both these, and that is this: that no man can certainlie tell, the
cause of Earthquakes, but onelie God, and these be his words:
Quaenam esse causam, quamobrem terra motus fiant, non cordibus
hominum, sensibus, opinionibus
                           
                              
                           
                           que

                           •
                        . And indeede
though that Earthquakes be workes and aboue our discusse of
reason, yet by the Scripture we be taught, that Earthquakes,
Thunderings and Lightenings, be tokens and tastes of Gods
most tremed and dreadfull power. And sometimes also they bée
plagues, inflicted to impenitent sinners in the time of Gods
wrath, teaching all men to stande in awe of God, and to beware
how they displease him, with breaking of his law and holie
commaundements.

                  What is to be thought of their saluation.
                  I Thinke of Esau and Ismael, so much onelie as the holie
Scripture hath sette foorth vnto vs. And I thinke that
there are no places extant, by which we maie define anie thing
touching their saluation. The Scripture thus speaketh of Esau,
that he so vehementlie hated his brother, that he sought to
kill him, that he solde his birth-right, that he prouoked his parents
to anger, when he had taken straunge women to wiues:
that he was a violent man, and despised the lande of Canaan,
promised vnto the fathers, and in the Epistle to the Hebrewes,
it is written, that although he poured out teares, yet found hée
no place of repentaunce. Of Ismael also we read, that he was
reiected not onelie by the will of Sara, but also by the will of
God. But touching both their posterities, I denie not but some
of them might be saued, no lesse then some of the stock of Iacob
might become runnagates and obstinate. For it is sufficient to
the election and reiection of God, that some parte of either
Stocke, bee either elected or reiected.
Peter Mar. vpon the Rom. fol. 251.
                  
                  Ye knowe how that afterward,He. 12. 17 when he would haue inherited
the blessing, he was put by, and he founde no meanes to
come thereby againe, no though he desired it with teares.
                  
                     ¶This text maketh not against repentaunce that is done in season,
for Esau repented too late, therefore profited not. When
sentence of iudgement is giuen, then hath repentance no place.
The dampned in Hell, shall wéepe and repent, but in vaine:
for then is the time of repenting past. The blessing which Isaac
gaue, was vndoubted done by the inspiration of the Holie
ghost, and giuen in stéed of a determinate sentence, and therfore
must néedes be ratified, and might not be called againe. But
and if Esau before the blessing giuen, had chaunged his manners,
and had heartelie & earnestlie repented him, he had surelie not
bene reproued of God. This should séeme to be the verie meaning
of this place.

is spoken: Except ye eate the flesh of the Sonne of man, and
drinke his bloud, you can haue no life in you, this letter killeth.
Origen. in Leuit. 7.
                  
                  He that eateth my flesh,Iohn. 6. 5
                           •
                        
                      and drinketh my bloud, abideth in
me and I in him. This is therefore (saith S. Austen)Augustin the eating
of that meate, and drinking of that bloud, is to abide in Christ,
and haue him abiding in vs. And therefore he that abideth not
in Christ, and in whom Christ abideth not, without doubt hee
eateth not Christs flesh nor drinketh his bloud, although he
eate & drinke the Sacrament of so great a thing, vnto his owne
damnation. Augu. sermo circa feria pas. ¶Héere it is plaine,
that he which abideth not in Christ, that is to saie, he that is
wicked & vnfaithfull, doth not eate his flesh, nor drink his bloud,
although he eate and drinke the Sacrament of so great a thing.
And so must it néedes follow that the Sacrament is not the verie
naturall bodie of Christ, for then the vnfaithfull should eate
his flesh, séeing he eateth the Sacrament of his bodie, but that
doth S. Austen denie. Wherefore it must néedes be, but onelie
a token of a remembraunce, and a signe of his bodie breaking,
and a representation of his passion.
                  He that abideth not in me, and in whom I abide not,Augu. de ciuit. Dei. li. 21. ca. 25 let him
not saie or think that he eateth my bodie, or drinketh my bloud.
They abide not in Christ, which are not his members, which
make themselues the members of an harlot. ¶Héere it is plaine
that the wicked and vngodlie or vnfaithfull (which are not the
members of Christ) do not eate his bodie nor drinke his bloud,

and yet they doe eate the Sacrament, as well as the other.
Wherefore it must néeds be that the Sacrament is not the verie
bodie of Christ, but a figure, token or memoriall thereof.
                  The bread (saith Saint Ambrose)Ambrose. that goeth into the bodie,
is not so gréedelie sought of vs, but the bread of euerlasting
life, which vpholdeth the substaunce of our soule, so he that discordeth
from Christ, doth not eate his flesh nor drink his bloud,
although he receiue y• sacrament of so great a thing, to his damnation
and destruction. Ambrose de Sacra. ¶Heere S. Ambrose
confirmeth S. Austens saiengs before.
                  Though we doe verelie eate Christ,Augustin yet it it followeth not,
that we doe groselie and naturallie eate him with our mouth.
And though Christ be verie meate, yet it followeth not that he
is therefore reallie & fleshlie in the Sacrament. S. Austen saith,
What preparest thou thy téeth or thy bellie, beléeue, and thou
hast eaten. In another place he saith: Beléeuing in him, is the
eating of the bread of life.
                  You shall not eate this bodie that you sée,Augustin nor drinke that
bloud, which they that crucified me shed out, I haue giuen a verie
sacrament vnto you, if it be spirituallie vnderstood, it quickeneth
you, but the flesh profiteth nothing. Augu. prefa. psal. 98.
¶This is plaine enough spoken.
Frith.
                  
                  He that discordeth from Christ (saith this Doctour) doth neither
eate his bodie nor drinke his bloud,Prospe. in li. sententiarum. although he receiue indifferentlie
the sacrament of so great a thing, vnto his condemnation
of his presumption. These are also the verie wordes of
Bede, vpon the 11. chapter of the first Epistle to y• 
                     Corinthians.
                  
                  ¶Therefore saith S. Cipriane,
                     Cipriane. he that drinketh of the holie
Cup, remembring this benefite of God, is more thirstie, then he
was before, & lifting vp his heart vnto the liuing God, is taken
with such a singular hunger and appetite, that he abhorreth all
gallie and bitter drinking of sinne, & all sauour of carnall pleasure
is to him as it were sharpe and sower vineger. And the sinner
being conuerted receiuing the holie mysterie of the Lordes
supper, giueth thankes vnto God, and booweth downe his head,
knowing that his sinnes be forgiuen, and that he is made cleane
and perfect, and his soule (which God hath sanctified) hée rendreth
to God againe, as a faithfull pledge, and then he glorieth
with Paule, and reioiceth saieng: Now it is not I that liue, but

it is Christ that liueth within me. These things be practised
and vsed among faithfull people, and to pure mindes, the eating
of his flesh, is no horrour but honour, and the spirite deliteth
in the drinking of the holie and sanctified bloud, and dooing
this, we whet not our teeth to bite, but with pure faith, we
breake the holie Bread. These be the words of Cipriane, De
coena Domini.
                  
                  The Word (saith Origen)Origen. was made flesh & verie meate,
which who so eateth shall surelie liue for euer, which no euill
man can eate. For if it could be, that he that continueth ill,
might eate the Word made flesh, séeing that he is the Word and
Bread of life, it should haue bene written: Whosoeuer eateth
this Bread, shall liue for euer.
Origen in Mathew. chapter. 15.
                  
                  The Authour of this tradition (Saint Cypriane)Cipriane. said, that
except we eate his flesh and drinke his bloud, we should haue no
life in vs, instructing vs with a spirituall lesson, and opening to
vs a waie to vnderstand so priuie a thing, that we shuld know,
that the eating is our dwelling in him, & our drinking is as it
were an incorporation in him, beeing subiect vnto him in obaieng,
ioined vnto him in our wills, and vnited in our affections:
the eating therefore of this flesh, is a certaine hunger and desire
to dwell in him.
                  S. Austen saith vpon the Gospell of Iohn,
                     Iohn. 6. 53 that he that doth
not eate his flesh and drinke his bloud, hath not in him euerlasting
life, and he that eateth his flesh and drinketh his bloud, hath
euerlasting life. But it is not so in those meates which we take
to sustaine our bodies, for although without them we cannot
liue, yet it is not necessarie that whosouer receiueth them shall
liue, for they maie die by age, sicknesse and other chaunces. But
in this meate and drinke of the bodie and bloud of our Lord, it
is otherwise, for both they that eate and drinke them not, haue
not euerlasting life. And contrariwise, whosoeuer eate & drinke
them, haue euerlasting life.
               
               
                  Who doe eate and drinke the bodie and
flesh of Christ.
                  They which doe beléeue in Christ, and doe assuredlie perswade
themselues, that he died for their sakes, they I saie, doth
both eate the flesh of Christ, and drinke his bloud, to which vse,

the Simboles or fignes, for that they stirre vp the senses, are
verie much profitable: not that the flesh & bleud of Christ are
powred into the bread & wine, or are by any means included in
those Elements, but because these things are of the true beléeuers
receiued wt a true faith. For they are an inuisible norishment,
which is receiued onelie in the minde, as Augustine hath
faithfullie admonished saieng: Why preparest thou the téeth
and the bellie, beléeue and thou hast eaten.
Pet. Mar. vpon Iudic. fol. 212.
                  
               
               
                  What it is to eate God.
                  To eate God, is to haue the fruition of the diuine nature, &
to be incorporate into God. But the Maiestie of God, so farre
surmounteth the capacitie of man, that as he is in himselfe in
nature and Godhead, no naturall creature is able ot conceiue
him, but onelie in the face and sight of Iesus Christ the sonne
of. God Therefore S. Paule saith: Christ is the brightnesse of
the glorie, and the expresse Image of the substaunce of God.
Iewel. fol. 240.
                  
               
               
                  Of the true sacramentall eating, and of the true eating
of Christs bodie.
                  The Sacrament (that is to saie the Bread) is corporallie eaten
and chawed with the téeth in the mouth. The verie bodie is
eaten and chawed with faith in the spirite. Ungodlie men when
they receiue ye sacrament, they chaw in their mouths (like vnto
Iudas) the sacramentall bread, but they eate not the celestiall
bread, which is Christ. Faithfull christian people (such as bée
Christs true disciples) continuallie from time to time record in
their minde the beneficiall death of our Sauiour Christ, chawing
it by faith in the cud of their spirit, and digesting it in their
hearts, féeding and comforting themselues with that heauenlie
meat. Also they dailie receiue not the sacrament therof, & so they
eate Christs bodie spirituallie, although not ye sacrament therof.
But when such men for their more comfort & confirmation of
eternal life, giuen vnto thē by Christs death, come vnto ye Lords
holie Table, then as before, they fedde spirituallie vpon Christ,
so now they féede corporallie also vpon the sacramentall bread.
By which sacramentall féeding in Christs promises, their former
spirituall feeding is increased, and they growe and waxe
continuallie more strong in Christ, vntill at the last they shall

come to the full measure and perfection in Christ. This is the
teaching of the true Catholike Church, as it is taught by Gods
word. And therefore Saint Paule speaking of them that vnworthelie
eate, saith that they eate the bread, but not that they
eate the bodie of Christ, but their owne damnation.
Cranmer. fol. 79.
                  
               
            
            
               ETERNALL LIFE.
               
                  How Eternall life is sometime called a reward.
                  ETernall life is sometimes in the holie Scriptures called a
reward, but then it is not that reward, which Paule writeth
to be giuen according to debt: but is all one, as if it shuld
be called a recompensation. Gods will and pleasure was, that
there should be this coniunction: that after good workes, should
followe blessednesse: but not yet as the effect followeth the
cause, but as a thing ioined with them by the appointment of
God. Therefore we maie not trust vnto workes, for they are
feeble and weake, and doe alwaies wauer & stagger. Wherfore
the promises of God depend not vpon them, neither haue they
in themselues as they come from vs, that they can mooue God
to make vs blessed. We saie therefore, that God iudgeth according,
because according as they are either good or euill, we shall
obtaine, either eternall life or eternall damation. But thereby
it followeth not, that workes are the cause of our saluation.

               EVANGELISTS.
               
                  Who be Euangelists.
                  EUangelists were next vnto Apostles, and had their Office
much like them; sauing that they were beneath them in degrée
of dignitie. These gaue themselues chiefelie to instructing
of the people, and preaching the Gospell to them, as plainlie and
simplie as might be, of which sort was Timothie and such like.
For although Paule match Timothie with him in dooing commendations,
yet doth he not make him his followe in Apostleship,
but kéepeth that name peculiarlie to himselfe. 2. Cor. 1. 1.
Col. 1. 1. And in writing to him he saith thus: Be watchfull
in all things, harden thy selfe in afflictions, go through with the

and is now taken, for the Sacrament of the Altar.
Eliote.
                  
                  When the Fathers saie, that Eucharist is but bread, they
speake hyperbolicallie, and vnderstande that it is not bread
onelie or alone, or common bread, because vnto the bread is
added the word of God, whereby it receiueth the nature of a
Sacrament. And this is a strong reason against the Anabaptists
which haue euer in their mouth that saieng of Paule vnto
the Corinthians: Circumcision and vncircumcision is nothing,
but the obseruation of the Commaundements of God, so they
saie that Baptime & the Eucharist, & the Ecclesiasticall mysterie
are nothing, but pretend onlie the obseruing of y• commaundements
of God. But we aunswere them, that other
things are nothing, if they be alone without faith and pietie
and a holie life.

Psalmes daie and night. And so much they gaue themselues to
praier, that they thought themselues bound to doe nothing els,
not to get their liuing with the sweate of their browes, not to
trouble themselues with anie Office that concerned the Common-wealth,
not to studie or to put their hand to anie kinde of
labour, but to liue in continuall idlenesse, in onlie eating, drinkking,
sléeping and praieng. Of whom also thus writeth the auncient
Greeke Authour I heodoret: And the miserable wretches
being deceiued, giue themselues to no kinde of worke, for
they call themselues spirituall men. But giuing themselues
to praieng, they sléepe the most parte of the daie.

in the same Chapter. The second, is true faith, in the onelie
grace and mercie of God, which is offered and graunted to vs

                  This prouing and examining of a mans selfe, is first to
thinke with himselfe with what lust and desire he commeth to
the Maundie, and will eate that bread, whether he be sure that
he is the childe of God, and in the faith of Christ: and whether
his conscience doe beare him witnesse, that Christs bodie was
broken for him: and whether the lust he hath to praise GOD
and thanke him with a faithfull heart in the middest of the
bretheren, doe driue him thetherward: or els whether hee dooe
it for the meates sake, or to kéepe the custome: for then were

it better that he were awaie. For he that eateth or drinketh
vnworthelie, eateth & drinketh his owne damnation, because
he maketh no difference of the Lords bodie.

man to another, but euerie man to himselfe. The Papists bid
thée goe to an auricular Confessour, there to confesse thy selfe,
to receiue absolution, and to make satisfaction for thy sinnes,
according to the forme that is commaunded thée. But Paule
the Doctour of the Gentiles, and the vessell of election, speaketh
not a word of these things, but saith simplie: Let a man examine
himselfe, and so let him eate of that bread, and drinke of
that Cup, for like as God is the searcher of the hearts, and requireth
the inward affection of the minde, and hateth hipocrisie:
so none knoweth what is in the heart of man, or what affections
we beare to Godward, but we our selues doe: therefore
he willeth vs our selues, to examine euerie thing in our
selues: That is to saie, he willeth euerie man to descend into
himselfe, and to examine himselfe.

               EXCOMMVNICATION.
               
                  What Excommunication is.
                  IT is the separation and reiection from the holie assemblie
of our Lord Iesus Christ,Mat. 18. 15 ye which is done by the Church,
against open and obstinate sinners.
Tindale.
                  
                  ¶Excommunication is a censure of the Eldership, whereby
he that is guiltie of some most grieuous crime, is without
anie certaine prescription of time, shut from the sacraments,
and banished the companie of the faithfull. This is the sorest
punishment of the Church, which also is called of Saint Paule,
a deliuering vp to Satan: of Christ to be as an Ethnike and
Publicane, which aunswereth the Iewes, cutting them off
from the Couenaunt, so often repeated to the people of God by
Moses. Héereof is oft mention made in the new Testament.
Iohn. 9. 18. And 1. Cor. 5. 4. 2. The. 3. 15. and in other places mo.
Now wheras it is so grieuous a punishment, it is executed on
none, but on him that is guiltie of some heinous trespasse,
which kind of sinnes are rehearsed by Saint Paule. 1. Cor. 5. 11.
                     
and 2. Thessa. 3. 14.
                  
                  Yet count him not as an Enimie, but warne him as a Brother.2. The. 3. 15
¶The ende of Excommunication, is not to driue from the
Church such as haue fallen, but to winne them to the Church
by amendement.

                  They shall excommunicate you.Iohn. 16. 2. ¶In that he saith, they
shall be excommunicated, his meaning is this: They shall cast
you out of their Sinagogues, they shall condemne you of impietie
and heresie, they will refraine you of water and fire, and
such necessaries. They will banish you, and sell your goods,
and they will account you not for Israelites, but for Gentiles
and Atheists. For the good as subiect, not onelie to persecution,
but also to ignomie and reproach, euen as saith the Apostle
Paule. Be thinketh that God hath set foorth vs, which are the
last Apostles, as it were men appointed to death: for we are
made a gasing stocke vnto the world, and to the Angells, and
to men. Christ notwithstanding commaundeth to stande firme
and stedfast against this temptation: because, though they bée
thrust out of Synagogues, yet neuerthelesse, they shall abide in
the kingdome of God.

                  And Alexander, which I haue deliuered to Satan.1. Tim. 1. 20. ¶Wheras
Saint Paule saith, that he did deliuer Alexander and Himeneus
vnto Satan, he meaneth none other thing therby, but
that he did excommunicate them openlie as no true Christians,
and that he did threaten them (if they would not repent and
tourne) that GOD woulde punish them euerlastinglie,
by Satan and his Angells.

but his diuinitie cannot be séene.
                  The Face of God is that which is described in ye 26. of Leuiticus:
I will tourne my face to you, & I will make you fruitfull:
I will giue you raine in season, and peace in the earth,
the sword shall not come in the Land, if ye wil walke in my

                  What is the Face or countenaunce of God? It is not a
shape like vnto a mans visage, which hath nose, eies & mouth:
but the Face of God is the recorde, which he giueth vs, when
we knowe his will. God therefore sheweth vs his Face,
when he telleth vs why he doth this thing or that, and it is all
one, as if wée sawe him before our Eies. Contrariwise, hée
hideth his face from vs, when hée afflicteth vs, when things
séeme straunge vnto vs, and when we knowe no reason why
he worketh after that sort. Therefore when God holdeth
vs in ignoraunce, it is an hiding of his Face from vs.

               FAITH.
               
                  What Faith is.
                  FAith is a sure confidence of things which are hoped for,Heb. 11. 1. and
a certeintie of things which are not seene. ¶Faith & trust in
Christ onelie, is the life and quietnesse of the conscience, & not
trust in works how holie so euer they be or appere. Works cā
                     not
set ye heart at rest, because we euer think they be not inough,
nor yet good inough, but to few, and so fal we to mistrusting, after
which followeth despairing, and so damnation, if we leaue
not the confidence in them, and sticke to faith, which canne receiue
and beléeue without mistrust, that Christs workes on the
crosse, hath full purged, cleansed, and loosed vs from our sinnes.
                  Againe, Faith is a liuely and stedfast trust in the fauour of
God, wherewith we commit our selues altogether vnto God,
and that trust is so surelie grounded, and sticketh so fast in our
hearts, that a man wold not once doubt of it, though he should
die a thousand times therfore, and such trust wrought by the holie
Ghost through faith, maketh a man gladde, lustie, chéerefull,
and true hearted vnto God and all creatures, by the meanes
whereof, willingly and without compulsion, he is glad and readie
to do good to euerie man, to suffer all things, that God maie

beloued and praised, which hath giuen him such grace, so that
it is impossibl
                        •
                      to separate good works from faith, euen as it is
impossible to separate heate and burning from fire. Therefore
take heede and beware of thine owne fantasies, which to iudge
of faith & good workes, will se
                        •
                     me wise, when indéede they are
starke blinde, and of all things most foolish. Praie God that hée
will vouthsafe to worke faith in thine heart, or else thou shalt
remaine euermore faithlesse, faine thou, imagine thou, enforce
thou, wrastle with thy selfe, and doe what thou wilt.
                  Againe, Faith is the beléeuing of Gods promises, & a sure
trust in the goodnesse and truth of God, which faith iustified Abraham
                           •
                        
Gen. 15. & was the mother of al his good works, which
he afterward did, for faith is the goodnesse of all workes in the
sight of God. Good works are things of Gods cōmaundement,
wrought in faith. And to shew a show at the commandement of
God to do thy neighbour seruice with all, with faith to be saued
by Christ (as God promiseth vs
                        •
                     ) is much better thē to build an
Abbeie of their own imagination, trusting to be saued, by y• fained
works of hypocrits. Iacob robbed Laban his vnckle, Moses
robbed the Aegiptians, & Abraham is about to sley & burne his
own son, & al are holy works because they are wrought in faith
at Gods commandement. To steale, rob, & murther, are no holy
works before worldly people, but vnto thē ye haue their trust in
God, they are holie when God, commandeth them. What, God
commaundeth not, getteth no reward with God. Holy works of
mens imagination, receiue their reward héere as Christ testifieth. Math. 6. 2.

                  Faith is an vndoubted beliefe most firmelie grounded in the
minde.

                  Againe, True faith is the wel-spring & root of all vertues &

and maketh it quiet and ioyfull.

                  How Faith is the ground of all good works.
                  As a good trée in the time of ye yeare bringeth foorth good apples,
not to make him good, for he is good before, nor yet this apple is
to his owne profit, but vnto other mens, notwithstanding ye good
nature ye is in him must needs bring it forth, So like wise y• iust
man must needs do good works, not by them to be iustified, but
alonelie in them to serue his brother, for he hath no néed of thē
                     
concerning iustification, This is the verie true way & maner of
doing good works, & how ye no man can do goods workes, but a
iustified man, as our sauiour Christ saith: either make y• trée good,
and then his fruit must be good, or els the tree euill, and his fruit
also euil, for a good trée must néedes bring forth good fruite, and a
bad euill fruite.

                  How Faith iustifieth.
                  The faith of true beleeuers is, ye God iustifieth or forgiueth, &
Christ deserueth it, & the faith & trust in Christs bloud receiueth
it, & certifieth the conscience thereof, & saueth & deliuereth from
feare of death & dampnation, & this is it ye we meane, when we
saie faith iustifieth, ye faith I meane, in Christ, & not in our own
works, certifieth the conscience ye our sins are forgiuen vs, for
Christs bloud sake.
Tindale. fol. 187.
                  
                  Againe, when I saie ye faith iustifieth, the vnderstanding is,
ye faith receiueth the iustifieng: God promiseth to forgiue our
sinnes, & to impute vs for full righteous. And God doth iustifie
vs actiuely, y• is to saie, forgiueth vs for ful righteous, & Christs
bloud deserueth it, & saith in the promiser receiueth it, & certifieth
the conscience therof. Faith chalengeth it for Christs sake,
which hath deserued all that is promised, & cleaueth euer to the
promise, & truth of the promiser, & pretendeth not the goodnes of
the worke, but knowledgeth that our works deserue it not, but
are crowned and rewarded, with the deseruinges of Christ.
Take an example of young children,Example of young children. when the Father promiseth
them a good thing, for dooing of some trifle, and when
they come for their reward, dalyeth with them saieng. What,
that thou hast done is not worth halfe so much? Should I giue
thée so great a thing for so little a trifle? Ye did promise mée,
ye said I should haue it: why did you promise, and whie
                        •
                      did
you saye so? And let him saie what he will to driue them off,
they will euen saie againe, you did promise me, so yée did, you
said I should haue it, so ye did: But hirelings will pretend their
worke and saie: I haue deserued it, I haue done so much, & my
worke is worthie it, &c.
Tindale. fol. 225.
                  
                  That faith the mother of all good workes iustifieth, before wée
can bring forth anie good worke, as ye husbād marrieth his wife,
before he can haue anie lawfull children by her. Furthermore,
as y• husbād marieth not his wife ye she shuld cōtinue vnfruitful

as before,Example of the Husband & as she was in the state of virginity (wherein it was
impossible for her to heare fruit) but contrariwise to make her
fruitfull: euen so faith iustifieth vs not, that is to saie, marrieth
vs not vnto God, that we shuld continue vnfruitfull as before,
but ye he should put his séed of his holie spirit in vs (as S. Iohn
in his first Epistle calleth it) & to make vs fruitfull. For, saith
Paule, Ephe. 2. 8. For by grace are ye made safe through faith, &
that not of our selues, for it is the gift of God, and commeth not
of works, least anie man should boast himselfe. For we are his
workmanship created in Christ Iesus vnto good works, which
God hath ordeined that we should walke in them.

is lyke a most filthy defiled cloath. The onely true glorieng
therefore is in the faith of the crosse of Christ, which excludeth
all that glorieng, which descendeth of the workes of the lawe.
Origen in his 13. booke ad Rom.
                  
                  We thinke that a man is iustified by faith,Hierome without the works
of the lawe. For because there is one God which iustifieth circumcision
of the law, and vncircumcision of faith. It manifestly
sheweth, that righteousnesse is not in ye merit of man but in the
grace of God, who without the workes of the law, accepteth the
faith of them that beleeue. Againe, In li

                        unc ergo iusti sumus, &c. Therefore we are then
righteous, when we confesse our selues sinners. And our righteousnesse
standeth not vpon our owne merit, but vpon the merit
of God.

Iames speketh not héere of true faith, which by loue is mightie
in operation, but of the vaine imagination & opinion y• the vnthankfull
people haue of faith, and therefore he doth call it dead
faith, because ther follow no good works of it, as there do of the
faith that iustifieth in the sight of God. To be iustified heere, &
in all the Chapter ouer is to be counted iust, & that before the
world, as in Luke. 10. 29 and 16. 15. and not to bee made iust in
the sight of God. So that when he saith, was not Abraham
                     Abraham our
Father iustified through works, &c. signifieth thus much, was
not Abraham our Father by his workes declared iust: That
is, did not his workes declare and shew that he was iust, and
were sure tokens or his righteousnesse, it signifieth that Abraham
was by his workes made iust before God, reputed righteous
obteined remission of sinnes, for by Faith he came thereby,
not by workes, as witnesseth S. Paule. Rom. 4

take it. First vnto Moses whereas the verie originall is. For
it is openlie declared, Gen. 15. 6. where these wordes were spoken
of Abraham: Abraham did beléeue, and it was reputed vnto
him for iustification, where there is no word of Isaac, for hée
was neither yet 
                        •
                     orn nor promised, & yet must Abraham néeds
be iustified, for the holie Ghost saith it. And when the wordes

were spoken vnto him, he was at the most but 86. yeares olde,
as it is declared in the. 16. Chapter, verse. 16. But when Isaac
was promised him by name, then was Abraham. 99. years
olde, as it is open in the. 17. Chapter, and the yeare after was
Isaac borne And when Isaac was borne, was Abraham. 100.
yeare olde, as it is plaine in the. 21. 5. Now would I knowe
that, where that Abraham was iustified from that he was 86.
yeare olde, till he was an hundred yeare olde, you cannot say by
offering vp of Isaac, for you sée he is not borne.
D. Barnes.
                  
                  Therefore by faith is the inheritaunce giuen,Rom. 4. 16. that it might
come of fauour, and the promise might be sure to all the séede.
¶Therefore by faith, &c. Therefore are ye pronounced righteous
by faith, by which vnderstand euen the mercie of God receiued
by faith, that the conscience might be surelie certified, of
the wil of God, and of the promises of the Gospel, that is, of remission
of sinnes, of reconciliation or reputation of righteousnesse,
& of the gift of euerlasting life, that these things cléerelye
be performed, which were not possible if the promise shoulde
depende and hang on our workes. For then shall the conscience
be vnsure, doubting whether we had works inough, whether
God would be mercifull, whether the law which we haue
trangressed would condemne vs, &c. Now when doubtfulnesse
remaineth in vs, ther remaineth also fearefulnes by which commeth
desperation & death, for so long as the law sheweth vs the
anger of God, feare of death cannot be ouercome. Therfore must
we néeds sticke onelie to faith in the mercifull promises of God,
surelie certified, and they shall be fulfilled, although our works
haue not deserued the fulfilling of them.

iust, is openlie knowne to be righteous, like as by the
fruites, the good tree is knowne to be good; otherwise maie not
this sentence be interpreted. For there could nothing be more
foolish then this saieng of Iames, if a man would thus interpret
it, that no man obteineth remission of sinne
                        •
                     , but because
his works are worthie of so great a benefit. This interpretation
who so sticketh frowardlie by, vnderstandeth not what remissiō
                     
of sinnes is, or how the cōscience ought to be comforted, when it
seeth that it bringeth no good works to God, which are sufficient
to please him. And this interpretation is cleane contrarie to
other open saiengs of the Scripture, which teach y• remission of
sins commeth fréely, as y• Psalmist saith: I said I wil acknowledge
mine offence,Psal. 32. 5. & accuse my selfe vnto ye Lord, & thou forgauest
me y• wickednes of my sin. And Ro. 4. 5. To him ye worketh

for righteousnes. What can be more plainlie, then y• sinnes
are forgiue to a wicked & vngodly man y• worketh not, y• is, not
for anie of his works, but fréely. To conclude, if ye gospel forgiue
not sins, but for our good works sake, & for our worthines it diffe
reth not frō y• law, it saueth no more thē y• law: this I trust wil
suffice y• good & wise. For as touching them y• bring nothing to
this cause but a will to brawle & chide, wil neuer suffer themselues
to be satisfied. And yet if we would contend by ye number
of authorities, this one place of Iames is ouerthrowne wt many
witnesses of Paule, if men wil vnderstand by iustificatiō al one
thing in thē both. Therefore Paule saith, Faith iustifieth, vnderstand
thereby y• faith causeth y• we be counted iust, reputed righteous,
& that our sins are not imputed vnto vs, but forgiuen vs
for. Christs sake. When Iames saith, works iustifie, he meaneth
thus Works declare vs iust, and shew euidentlye, that we are
righteous. Thus shalt thou make them agree.

against them which attributeth iustification to good works. And
Iames reasoneth against them which vtterlie condemne works.
Therefore Paule sheweth the cause of our iustification, & Iames
the effects. In Paule is declared how we are iustified: in Iames
how we are knowne to be iustified. In Paule, works are excluded,
as not y• cause of our iustification: in Iames they are approued
as effects procéeding thereof. In Paule they are denied to go
before them that be iustified: in Iames they are said to followe
them that are iustified.

                  First of all we know for certeine, that the faith of Abraham
did profit his posteritie, whē as he embraced y• couenant & promise,
made to him and his séede. The like we ought to iudge in
all the faithfull, because by their faith they spread out the grace
of God to their children & posteritie, and that before they bée
borne. And also the same taketh place in children & young infants,
who for want of age are not apt to haue faith. But they
which are ripe of yeares, whose faith is insufficient whether
they be straungers or of y• same line or kinred, an other mans
faith (in respect of the eternall saluation of the soule) doth nothing
profit them but onelie mediate.

mountains, & also to cast out euill spirits, we must note of what
faith the Lord speaketh heere: let vs vnderstand therefore, y• ther
are thrée kindes of faith.Three kindes of Faith. The first, is that by the which certeine
things are beléeued to be such as they are declared to be in the
Scriptures. As in Scripture, we heere y• ther is one God, being
omnipotent & the creatour of all things, this faith is called an
historicall faith. The second, is y• which we beléeue the promises
of God, & apprehend y• mercy & grace of God in Christ Iesu: this
faith is said to be a iustifieng faith. The third is that by ye which
a man doth firmeli
                        •
                      beléeue that ther is nothing impossible vnto
God & the minde armed by a certeine inspiration of the spirit,
to doe meruailous things, & this is called the faith of myracles.
The first kinde of faith is most general, insomuch y• it per

euen to ye wicked, with ye which faith also Satan is indued,
as appeareth by the words of the Apostle:Iam. 2. 19. Thou beleeuest
that there is one God; thou dost well, the diuels also beleeue &

tremble. The second kinde of faith, per
                        •
                     eineith onlie to ye elect
& chosen of God, as witnesseth ye Apostle Paule in his Epistle
to Titus, by the which faith we are made members of Christs
bod

                        •
                     aith Christ speaketh not heere, neither
doe al they ye haue the same, w

                     aith perleineth so certein christians, & that
not at all times, but it hath a certeine consideratiō also. This
faith maie also be called a perticular of speciall faith, & it is no
doubt a singuler gift of the holie Ghost, as S. Paule teacheth
saieng: To some faith is giuen by the same spirit, the which
truly cannot be said of ye iustifieng faith, which perteineth not
to a certeine onely, but vnto all the elect and chosen of God.
This faith saueth no man, neither doth it change the hearts of
men, & therfore it is such a faith as is also giuen vnto ye wicked,
& therfore we haue alredie heard in the 7. chapter going
before, how the wicked at the day of iudgement shall say vnto
Christ: Lord, Lord, haue we not prophesied in thy name, & by
thy name cast out diuels, & done manie miracles in thy name?
To whom it shall be answered, I neuer knew you: depart frō
                     me
ye ye worke iniquitie. And in an other place ye Apostle saith:
If I had all faith, so ye I could remoue mountains, & haue no
loue, it is nothing: Of this faith Christ speaketh héere. wher he
saith. If ye haue faith like a graine of mustard seed.

and inforce to quench the true vnderstanding of the lawe, and
the right meaning and intent of all the workes commaunded
by God, which fight is a fight aboue all fights. First, they shall
be in such number, that Christs true Disciples shall be but a
small stocke in respect of them. They shall haue workes like
Christ, so that fasting, praier, pouertie, obedience and chastitie,
shall be the names of their profession. For as Paule saith to the
Corinthians. The Angels or messengers of Satan, shal change
themselues into the Angells or messengers of light and truth.
They shall come in Christs name, and that with signes & miracles
and haue the vpper hande also, euen to deceiue the verie
elect if it were possible. Yea, and beyond all this, if thou get the
victorie of the false Prophets, & plucke a multitude out of their
hands, there shall immediatelie rise vp of the same and sette vp a
new false sect against thee. And against all those Amalechites
the onelie remedie is to lifte vp the hands of thy heart to God
in continuall praier, which hands if thou for wearinesse oncelet
fall, thou goest to the worse immediatelie.

If thou loue and pitie thy neighbour and help him, thine almes

that belongeth to God, or for a greater profite onelie, or to make
satisfaction for thy sinnes past, and to dishonour Christs bloud

time,3. sorts of Fasting. whereby the bodie is kept lewe, and as it were mortified.
And it is of thrée sorts, indifferent, godlie and vngodlie. The indifferent
Fast is, when a man abststaineth, either for pouertie,
or for health sake, &c. The godlie fast is not onelie an abstinence
from meate and drinke, but also from all other things that may
delight or prouoke the flesh to sinne. The vngodlie Fast, is an
abstinence from certaine kinde of meates, which of it selfe is
thought to be a worshipping of God, and a thing acceptable to
God for the workes sake, and therefore also meritorious, &c.
                  And this hypocriticall Fast, is it that the Prophet doth condemne.

what Christ aunswereth: he saith that the Apostles could not,
because of their incredulitie and weaknesse of faith, and afterward
he addeth these two (fasting & praier) as wepons & works
of faith, which cannot be seperated frō faith, neither can be found
in the olde bottells of ye hypocrits This praier when it striueth
against ye diuell, it surmounteth all worldlie things or plesures,
and the same is also the onelie true fast, to neglect (for the time)
all worldlie things, to neglect meat & drink, & whatsoeuer bodelie
pleasure or desire maie be imagined, y• in praier thy minde

appeareth, that the true fast is to put awaie all wanton desires
and lusts, &c. And to rule the bodie by conuenient chastitie and
mortifieng, as it is said in ye

                  Of miraculous Fast.
                  Ther is a fast which is aboue mans strength, & is sometime
giuen of God meruailously vnto some of his saints,Miraculous fast. to commend
their doctrine. Moses in the mountain fasted 40. daies. For God
wold by a notable example shew, ye the law which he set foorth,
came from himselfe, & was not inuented of men. Neither went
Moses therefore vnto ye mountaine to fast, but to receiue ye law
of God, & to talke with him. Elias also receiuing bread & water
of ye Angell, & in ye strength of ye meate walked 40. daies, euen
vnto ye mount of God, Horeb, ye he by this miracle shuld be declared
to be ye true reuenger of ye law. By this kinde of fasting
our sauior cōmended ye preching of ye Gospel, y• it shuld not séeme
to be a thing vulgar, but shuld be proued a thing begun by god.
But these were miracles neither pertain they anie thing vnto
vs, but only y• we shuld haue thē in admiratiō, & by such exāples
be stirred vp wt reuerēce, to receue ye word of god. P. M. vp. I. 274
And whē he had fasted 40. daies. ¶The fasting of Christ ought
to be vnto vs an example of sober liuing, not for 40. daies, as
some do imagin of their own brains, but as lōg as we are heere
in this wildernes

                  Of the fast compelled.
                  Ther is a fast, which lieth not in our power, as when we béeing
destitute of meate, haue not whereof to 
                        •
                     ate. Héere is need
of patience,Compelled fast. & we must praie vnto God y• he would strengthen
& encourage vs. So the Saints when they wandred about, &
preached the Gospell, were compelled sointinies to hunger. And
the disciples when they followed y• Lord
                        •
                     , wer driue

                      by hunger
to plucke ye eares of corne, & to rub out ye corne, Elias also desired

meate of the widdow, and waited at the Brooke for such meat
                        •
                     
as the Rauens should bring him. This kinde of fasting men do
not take vpon them of their owne frée will, but it is laide vpon
them by God.

                  The Father is greater then I.Father greater then I. First I saie,Ioh. 14. 18. that one
place of the Gospell, is not to be expounded against the whole
purpose of the booke, which is to teach that the Lord Iesus, is
Gods naturall s
                        •
                     nne and equall to God. And sith the Euangelist

                     lie, they shew

themselues mad, y• would make him to incounter against himselfe.
Second, I say that in that place, the Lord Iesus compareth
not his substaunce with his Fathers substaunce, but compareth
his present humble state, with the glorious state, that he
should haue after his Ascension. And therefore all the godly old
fathers well nigh haue taught these wordes to be spoken of his
mans nature, which should be forthwith aduaunced to immortall
and incorporall glorie, by the power of the Father. Some
Gréeke Writers indéede, admit that the Father is greater then
the Sonne, not because he had greater power, or that there is anie
difference in their substance & essence, but in that he is the
Father and begetteth the sonne, & is not begotten of the sonne,
therefore he maie be said greater. The meaning also of these
words, The Father is greater then I, maie be this: The end
why I trauaile with you is not, that you should staie in me, and
looke no farther, but to bring you to the Father, as to the last
marke, that with me ye maie see him as he is, whose glorie is
more deere to me, then mine owne glorie, and therefore I séeke it
more then mine own, and I think that I haue not accomplished
mine office vntill I haue brought you to him, &c.

                  The Father haue eaten sower Grapes,Eze. 18. 2. and the childrens

Fathers had sinned, and the Children were punished for their

transgressions. Read Ieremie. 31. 29.

                  The fathers wickednesse punished in their children.
                  There is a double manner of punishing the wickednes of the
fathers vpon the children,Io
                           •
                        . 5. 4. for sometime God sheweth mercie to
the children, and yet notwithstanding ceaseth not to chastise the
vnrighteousnes of their fathers in ye persons of their children.
As for example: we see a father that hath gotten much goods,
howbeit by wicked bargening, by subtiltie, by craft and by crueltie,
& yet God hath pitie vpon the childe of such a man: and
what will he doe? He will rid him quite and cleane of all those
euill gotten goods, because they would but bring him to confusion:
according as it is said, that such kind of riches are as wood,
which in the ende will kindle the fire of Gods wrath. Therefore
when the Lord meaneth to saue ye childe of a wicked man
that hath liued amisse, he bereaueth him of al the euill gotten
goodes, as though he should lette him bloud to saue his life,
that he might not be wrapped in ye mischife & coruption, which
his father had drawen vnto himselfe. Behold how God punisheth
the wickednes of the fathers vpon the children, & yet ceaseth
not to be the sauiour of ye children, & to shew them mercie.
Sometimes he passeth farther, & because the fathers haue ben
so far out of al square
                        •
                      as they haue led a stubborne & froward
life, God forsaketh their ofspring, insomuch y• the grace of his
spirit dwelleth not with them. Now when we be so destitute of
Gods guiding, we must néeds run into destruction, & néeds must
the mischiefe increase more & more. Thus we sée y• when the
children of the vngodly do beare the sins of their fathers, it is
not only for that God forsaketh them, and leaueth them vp to
the state of their owne nature
                        •
                      but also for that he giueth Satan
full power ouer them, and letteth him haue the bridle, to

                        •
                     aigne in such houses at his pleasure. And when ye diuell hath
led awaie the fathers, and carried them into all naughtinesse,
their children shall also ouer-shoote themselues, into excessiue
outrage. We see then as now what is meant héere, that is to
wit
                        •
                      that when the children of wicked men are

of Gods grace, & walke after their inordinat

                      they must
néeds come to greater confusion then their Fathers.

                  How our fathers did eate the same spirituall meate, &c.
                  
                     Our Fathers did all eate the same spirituall meate,1. Cor. 10. 3 and did
all drinke of the same spirituall drinke, and then dranke of that
spirituall Rocke, that followed them, which Rocke was Christ.
¶These words Saint Austen expoundeth, saieng: What is to
eate the same meate? But that they did eate the same which
we doe. Whosoeuer in Manna vnderstoode Christ, did eate the
same spirituall meate that we doe, that is to saie, that meate
which was receiued with faith and not with bodies. Therefore
to them that vnderstoode and beléeued, it was the same meate
and the same drinke. So that to such as vnderstoode not, the
meate was onelie Manna, and the drinke onelie water, but to
such as vnderstoode, it was the same that it is now. To come
and is come, be diuers words, but it is the same Christ. These
be S. Austens words De vtilita. poeniten.
                  
               
               
                  How our fathers were iustified by faith, as we are now.
                  The fathers were no lesse iustified onely by the faith of Christ
then we. Wherfore it is written in the booke of Genesis of Abraham, that he beléeued and it was counted vnto him for righteousnes.
Iohn also testifieth that Christ said of Abraham, y• hée
had séene his daie & therin reioiced. The Epistle to the Hebrewes.
the 13 chap. affirmeth that Christ was yesterdaie & to daie, & remaineth
for euer. Wherfore, euen as we are said now to be saued
not by workes, but by the true mercie of God, by faith in
Christ, so was it with the Fathers at y• time, for they wer iustified
by no works, but only by faith in Christ. Furthermore,
what obedience soeuer ye fathers had towards ye commandemēts
of God, & also faith in the promises, they were not deriued from
their own strength & power, but (euen as it also happeneth vnto
vs) they came vnto them by the grace of God and Christ.

we are striken, by reason of some great and hurtfull euill
which is at hand. We are not commonlie moued by such daungers
which are far from vs, but by those which seeme to be euen
now at hand, neither do things light and of small waight make
vs afraid. Wherefore feare, as a Diuine speaketh of feare, hath
a respect vnto sinne, vnto the wrath of God, vnto chastisement &
scourges, and finallie vnto hell fire. But there are noted two
kinde of feares,2. Feares. of which the one is commonly called filiall, that
is, pertaining to a naturall childe, and the other seruile, that is,
pertaining to a bond-man. And that is called a seruile feare,
which onelie by the feare of paines & of hell fire, either draweth
vs backe from doing euill, or impelleth vs to do well. Euen
so signified an Ethnike Poet,Horace. when he wrote: Oderunt peccare

                        , that is, The wicked hate to sinne, for
feare of punishment. But the finall feare is, whereby men liue
vpright and flie wickednesse, for that they desire to set foorth the
glorie of God, and for that they allow righteousnesse euen for
his owne sake, wherfore the same Poet saith: Oderun
                           •

loue of vertue, &c.

                  Difference of feares.
                  
                     Peter feared otherwise then did Iudas. For Iudas indéede
so feared that he despaired: but Peter. so feared that he gotte
him againe vnto Christ, whom before by denieng, he had forsaken.
Where we saie that a seruile feareSeruile feare. is, whereby we so abhorre
God being angrie, and flie from him that we are vtterly
void of faith. But a filial feareFiliall feare. is, wherby in ye midst of terrors,
we are lifted vp through faith, neither suffer we our selues to
be swallowed vp with feare. Wherfore in godlie men feare is
neuer seioined from faith. For these. 2. things are so to be knit
together, y• faith alwaies gouerneth feare:Faith gouerneth feare. for if it shuld not, desperation
wold easily succéed: for euen as ye law ought alwaies
to be ioined with ye gospell, so also ought feare to be euer ioined
with faith. We do not so imbrace ye gospell, but y• we alwaies
think vpō ye obediēce of ye cōmandemēts of God: & when we see
how often & how grieuously we fal, we call our selues back again
by repētance. And contrariwise ye law is not to be receiued
without the gospell, for if it should, we could neuer obey it
without Christ, nor also obtaine pardon for the offences which
we committed against it.

                  What Feare importeth.
                  Feare importeth as much as y• our life must be ruled according
to the will of God. For what becommeth of men, when
they know not themselues to be subiect to their maker? They
rush out into al naughtines. We know what our lusts are, thē
if ye feare of god raign in vs, we must acknowledge y• he hath
not put vs into ye world to liue at such libertie as we lust our
selues, but reserueth his whole right ouer vs, so as we must
obey him: behold (I say) what the word feare importeth, y• is to
say, y• we shuld lern to direct our whole life to ye wil of god, &c.

We haue not receiued the spirit of fearefulnesse, but of might &

the iudgment of the Lord, of which he willeth the godly which
loue God not to be afeard: and he rendreth a reason, for y• feare
hath vexation ioined with it. Wherefore I gladlie assent vnto
Augustine which saith, that Iohn speaketh of perfect Charitie,
which forasmuch as it cannot be had in this life, we maie not
looke to haue it without feare. Further we mought in this place
vnderstand, that feare which is se

                     oined from confidence: & therfore
driued men to desperation. For they which beleeue & loue
God trulie, vphold their feare with a liuely faith.

                  Of feare that commeth of faith, and of

he knoweth he shall offend God, and doe whatsoeuer hée
perceiueth to be acceptable vnto him, & this feare hath his beginning

                        . 11. 20 but feare. ¶No man of the number
of the faithfull, ought to be in doubt of his saluation. For the
nature of faith is, to make men assured of the promise of God.
Howbeit, this is to be known, y• it is not possible, that so long
as we liue héere, we should not vtterlie shake off all feare, for
we are continuallie tossed betwéene two cogitations, the one of
the goodnes, faith & constancie of god. The other of our corruption,
infirmitie & pronesse to euill. For when we consider how
weak we are & prone to euil, & cōsider also ye filthines & imperfection
of our workes, though they be neuer so good, & therwithal
the seueritie of the law in requiring euen to the vttermost,
the things which it commaundeth. This consideration (I saie)
if it be vehement, cannot but excéedinglie make afeard ye mind,
and deiect it. But on the other side, when we consider the clemencie,
goodnesse & mercie of God, & his constancie in his promises,
& therewithall remember, that all the merits of Christ
are communicated to vs, we are refreshed and recreated, and
the feare is either lenified, or els sometime vtterlie laide awaie.
And these effects where they are perfect & vehement, doe
succéed ye one the other, for they cannot be both at one time, or
if they be both at one time, then are either of them remisse, & not
vehement. But in what matter they giue place ye one to ye other
we may by daily experience vnderstand. For if a man be set
vpon ye top of an high tower,Tovver & if being ther his mind run vpon
n
                        •
                     thing els but vpon the height of the tower, & what a déepe
way he shuld fall, so y• he cannot fall without danger of death,
it i
                        •
                      possible but y• his minde being still vpon this, he should be
altogether smitten with an errour: but if he turne his eie aside

to the barre or battlements which staie him vp that he cannot
fall, then will he plucke vp his spirits againe, and put away al
feare: neither ought it to seeme vnto anie man straunge, y• wée
saie that faith expelleth that feare, which is ioined with doubting
of saluation, when as in Iohn it is said, That charitie driueth
feare out a doores. For it is most certeine that y• which the
Scripture attributeth to charitie, may be attributed to faith:
for charitie springeth of faith.

¶There be two manner of feruentnesse of minde, &
two maner of good intents. The one is grounded vpon a vaine
or fleshlie opinion, and not vpon Gods word: this good intent
is damnable before God. The other procéedeth of faith, and suffereth
it selfe to be ruled by the wisdome and iudgement of the
spirit of God. Such feruentnesse was in Moses, in Phin

agréeable to the foundation shall stand still. And that doctrine
which is not fullie agréeable, and yet hath kept the foundation

bodie for of a shew or a fancie, ther can be no figure. But
Christ gaue vnto his Disciples a figure of his bodie, therefore it
must needs follow, that Christ had a verie naturall bodie. His
words be these: Christ taking the bread and distributing it to
his Disciples, made it his bodie, saieng: This is my bodie, that
is to say: This is a figure of my bodie: but a figure it could not
bée, vnlesse there were a bodie of a truth, and indeede, for a voide
thing as is a fantasie, can receiue no figure.

                      that if a man vnderstand
the words of Christ carnallie, he shal surelie profit nothing therby.
For what meane these words, the flesh auaileth nothing? He
meant not his flesh (God forbid) but he ment of them that fleshlie
and carnallie vnderstood those things that Christ spake. But
what is carnall vnderstanding? To vnderstand the words simplie
as they be spoken, & nothing else. For we ought not so to
vnderstand the things which we see. But all mysteries must
be considered with inward eyes, & that is, spirituallie to vnderstand
them. ¶In these wordes S. Chrisostome sheweth plainlie,
that the words of Christ concerning the eating of his flesh,
and drinking of his bloud, are not to be vnderstoode simplie, as
they be spoken, but spirituallie and figuratiuelie.

it his bodie, saieng: This is my bodie, that is to saye (sayth

Whensoeuer the Scripture of Christ séemeth to commaund

and must be vnderstood spirituallie and not after the letter.
Except (saith he) ye eate the flesh of the sonne of man, and
drinke his bloud, ye shall haue no life in you, he séemeth (saith
S. Austen) to commaund a foule & wicked thing, it is therefore
a figure. ¶Now seeing that Saint Austen calleth it a foule
thing to eate his flesh, we maie soone perceiue that he thought
it as foule & as wicked a thing to eate his bodie, séeing his bodie
is flesh. And then consequentlie it must followe, that either

be taken spirituallie, or els y• this saieng of Christ. This is my

not the verie daye he dyed vppon, but onelie a remembraunce
of his bodie breaking and bloud-shedding. And likewise as
the next Easter daye, shall bée called the daye of his resurrection,

                  Of the first begotten sonne, An aunswere
to Helindius the heretike.
Obiection.
                  Our Sauiour Christ was called her first begotten
sonne,Ma. 1. 25. and none (sayth Helindius) canne hee called first begotten,
but hée that hath bretheren, euen as hée is called the
onelie begotten sonne, which is the onelye sonne of his Father.
               
               
                  Aunswere.
                  That is not true, for euerie onelye sonne is the first begotten,
although he haue no brethren, and therefore in the booke
of Numbers, the almightie God doth define, who, or what is

the first begotten, saieng: All that breaketh the matric
                        •
                     
in all flesh, whether it bée of men or of beastes, shall bée
slaine: neuerthelesse the first borne of man, thou shalt redéeme.
Héere the worde of the Lorde doth define what first
borne is, that is, euerie one that openeth the matrice first:
namelye, whether it be onelye begotten or first begotten.
The Lorde saith not, tarrie vnto the sccond be borne: but
he saith: Those that are to be redéemed shalt thou redéeme,
from the age of a moneth, for the value of a moneth,
namelie, for fiue Sickles. For if it shoulde haue
bene so, that he that first openeth the matrice, shoulde
not be called the first borneFirst born vntill he haue bretheren, then
might some man haue saide, I owe nothing vnto the Priest,
till that he be brought foorth, by whome he that is alreadie
borne be made first begotten. Also in Exodus it is said. And
at midnight the Lorde smote all the first borne in the lande
of Aegypt, both of man and beast. Now if it be true that none
are first begotten, but they that haue brethren, then the onelie
begotten although they were first borne, perished not.

vowe of chastitie, but for the refusing of the faith of Christ.

                  In the lawe it was commaunded, that of all the increase
and fruits of the earth, shuld be giuen vnto God the first fruits,

yea, also the first borne of liuing creatures, were due vnto
him. And when Paule maketh mention of the masse or 
                        〈…〉

                           •
                        s Chapter of the
booke of Numbers, that some part of the lumpe of new dowe
was commanded to bée separated for God, before that the new
bread should be tasted of: for thereof were made swéete cakes,
which were offered vnto God. Which thing he therefore caused
to be done, that men by that ceremonie might vnderstand,
and of their owne accorde testifie, that God is vnto them the
giuer and distributer of all fruites. Wherefore that oblation
increased not the riches of God, which are otherwise infinite,
but also nourished in men a gratefull memorie of benefites
receiued. As oftentimes Emperours and greate and mightie
kings, giue vnto some one man a citie or prouince, or some certeine
dominion, with this condition, That he shall paie vnto
him euerie yeare some thing of small value in the name of
a Tribute, not that they séeke by that talent to be enriched,
but that they maie perpetuallie vnderstande and testifie, that
he dependeth vppon that Prince, and that he hath at his handes
obteined that dignitie, which he nowe enioyeth. Moreouer, this
commoditie had the Common weale by that ceremonie,

                      that by
such oblations the holie ministrie was susteined, whose vse is
so great, that it ought to be mainteined, yea, though with great
charge Moreouer in all the first fruites was signified Christ,
the first borne of all creatures, and namelie the first fruites of
them that rose againe from the dead, whereby all the faythfull
are sanctified: for by first fruites was made holye that which
was remaining, and left at home to susteine the familie. Yea,
and this manner of offering first fruites, was deriued also
vnto the Ethnikes, for the Uirgins called Vestae offered first
fruites vnto their domesticall Gods: And as Plutarch telleth
in Symposiacis, the men in olde time dranke not anie Wine,
before that they had first offered sacrifice to some God, that that
which they dranke might not hurt them. And at Athens the
xi. daie of the moneth, they offered the first fruites of Wine.
In all these things wée maie beholde the steppes of that holie
institution. Although y• Ethnikes had with idolatrus superstition
violated that which was well instituted. At this daye also
although the yoke of the Ceremonies of Moses be taken away,

yet should it be verie well done of vs, of our frée and liberall
will, to offer vnto God, the first fruites, by giuing them to the
poore.

                  FLesh is not vnderstood,Rom. 8. as though flesh were onelie ye which
perteineth vnto vnchastitie. But Paule calleth flesh héere
as Christ doth. Iohn. 3. All that is borne of flesh, that is to wit,
the whole man with life, soule, bodie, wit, will, reason, & whatsoeuer
he is or doth within or without: because that those al, &
all that is in man, studie after the world and the flesh, &c.

                  By y• déeds of ye law no flesh shalbe iustified.Gal 2. 16. ¶Flesh in Paule
doth not signifie (as ye schoolmen dreame) manifest & grose sins,
for these he vseth to call by their proper names, as adulterie,
fornication, vncleanenesse, & such like: but by flesh Paule meaneth
héere as Christ doth in the third chapter of Iohn. That
which is borne of flesh (saith he) is flesh. Flesh therefore signifieth
the whole nature of man. This flesh (saith he) is not iustified
by works, no nor of the lawe. Flesh therefore according
to Paule, signifieth all the righteousnesse, wisdome, deuotion,
religion, vnderstanding & will that is possible to be in a naturall
man. So that if a man be neuer so righteous, according to
reason and the lawe of God, yet with all his righteousnesse,
works, merits, deuotion and religion, he is not iustified, &c.
Luther vpon the Gal. fol. 65.
                  
                  That which is borne of flesh is flesh,Iohn. 3. 6. &c. ¶That is
fleshlie, to wit, wholie vncleane and vnder the wrath of God:
And therefore this worde (Flesh) signifieth, The corrupt nature
of man, contrarie to which is the (Spirit) that is the man
ingraffed into Christ, through the grace of the holie Ghost,
whose nature is euerlasting and immortall, though the strife
of the flesh remaineth.

in the Gospell, when he said vnto his disciples, ye are not of this

framed vnto vs as we féele it to be: and he addeth moreouer,
that the wise men of the world, are in the flesh, because they resist
faith and will beléeue those things onelie, which are agréeable

the name of flesh vnderstandeth reason, and the higher parts of

this S. Austen saith, Why preparest thou either tooth or bellie,

them offended, hée said vnto them: Doth this offende you?
What will ye saie then, when ye shall see the Sonne of man

Austen, You shall know that he meant not to giue his flesh to

it is the spirite that quickeneth, the Flesh profiteth nothing,
the wordes that I speake are spirite and life, that

is to saie saith S. Austen, are spirituallie to be vnderstood. And
when Christ saith his flesh profiteth nothing (meaning of his
owne flesh as Austen saith) he meaneth that it profiteth not as
they vnderstood him, that is to saie, it profiteth not if it were eaten,
but it doth much profite to be slaine, that through it and the

wit, will, reason, and whatsoeuer he is or doth, within or without,
because that those all,Flesh and Spirite. and all that is in man, studie after the
world and the Flesh. Call Flesh therefore, whatsoeuer (as long
as we are without the spirit of God) we thinke or speake of God,
of faith, of good workes, and of spirituall matters. Call Flesh
also all workes which are done without grace, and without the
working of the spirit of God, howsoeuer, good, holie and spirituall
they seeme to be, as thou maist proue by the 5. to the Galathians
ver. 19. & 20. where Paule numbreth worshipping of Idolls,

Lawe by the reason of the Flesh is weake, which is not vnderstood
of vnchastitie onelie, but of all sinnes, and most speciallie of
vnbeliefe, which is a vice most wicked, and ground of all sinnes,
and as thou callest him which is not renued with the spirit, and
borne againe of Christ, Flesh, and all his deedes, euen the verie
motions of his heart and minde, his learning, doctrine, and contemplation
of high things, his preaching, teaching, and studie in
the Scripture, building of Churches, founding of Abbaies, giuing
of Almes, Masse, Mattin

washing of the Disciples feete done by Christ, and Peters fishing
after the Resurrection, yea, and all the déedes of Matrimonie
are pure spirituall, if they proceede of faith, and whatsoeuer
is done within the lawes of God, though it be wrought by the
bodie, as the verie wiping of shooes & such like, howsoeuer grose
they appeare outward. Without such vnderstanding of these

nothing, to wit, if it be considered as separated from his diuine

giueth life, meaning God dwelling in Iesus Christ corporallie

                  ¶Although God take vs out of this world,Caluine yet forgetteth hée
vs not, though he séeme to forget vs: hée keepeth those that
are his, alwaies in his hande and custodie. And as for those
that are damned, they be reserued as it were in chaines, vnto
the daie of executing the sentence. Ye see then, that God doth
beare vs alwaies in minde. And when the Scripture saith,
that he hath forgot vs, it is because we perceiue not his present
succour, like as if a poore man that lingereth in paine, desire
God to helpe him, and féele not his helpe, nor sees any likelihood
that God heareth him. Thus ye sée after what sorte it is

we shall obtaine forgiuenesse of our sinnes, but rather this is
added for a plaine and infallible token to certifie therewith our
conscience, that we haue through faith in Iesus Christ for remission
of our sins. For if we can finde in our hearts, vnfainedlie
to forgiue vnto our bretheren their trespasses: it is a most infallible
token, that our sinnes are cleane washed awaie & quite
forgiuen.
Sir. I. Cheeke.
                  
                  ¶Because he knoweth that our nature is so weake, that we
cannot but sinne dailie: therefore he teacheth vs dailie to repent,
and to reconcile our selues together, & dailie to aske God
forgiuenesse. Séeing he commandeth vs to aske, we may be bold
so to do, and to beléeue that he will forgiue vs. No man therefore
néedeth to despaire, that can repent & aske forgiuenesse, how
déepe soeuer he hath sinned. And me thinke, if we looke a little
néere vpon this text, we néeded not to make the Pope so great a
God for his pardons. For Christ (which is a man to be beléeued)
sheweth vs héere a more sure way, yea, and that a sensible way,
which we may féele that we be pardoned, & our sinnes forgiuē.
                  
                     We can haue no experience of the Popes things whether
they be so or no? He can with all his Pardons deliuer
no man of any Pargatorre that God putteth vs vnto in this
world He cannot blesse or heale anie man, so mush as of a poore

                        •
                     gue or Tooth-ach, which diseases yet by his own confession
GOD putteth on vs, to purge vs from our sinne. But where
we cannot see, feele or haue anie experience at all, that it so
is, there is he mightie. If I were come home out of a land,
where neuer man was before, and were sure neuer man
should come. I might tell as many wonders as Master Moore
doth of Vtopia, and no man could rebuke me. But héere Christ
maketh thée sure of pardon, for if thou canst forgiue thy Brother,
GOD hath bound himselfe to forgiue thee. What if no
man haue sinned against mee? that were hard in this life. Neuerthelesse,
if that profession be in thy heart, that thou knowest
that is thy dutie to forgiue thy brother for thy fathers sake, and
art obedient vnto thy fathers ordinaunce, and wouldest forgiue
if anie of thy bretheren had offenced thée, and did aske thee forgiuenesse,

a chaungeable happening in outward things, either good or
euill. Of which word Fortune, are deriued these words, which
no Religion forbiddeth vs to vse: Forte, forsan, forsitan, fortasse,
fortuito: y• is, Perhaps, peraduenture, by fortune & by chaunce,
which yet must al be applied to y• prouidence of God. And that
did I not leaue vnspoken when I said, For peraduenture that
which is commonlie called Fortune is also ruled by sercet order:
and we call chaunce in things, but that whereof the reason

It pleased God: they saie, It pleased Fortune.

Wée must beléeue and confesse (saith hée) that Christ according

                  S. Paule speaking of Christs incarnation saith, that he béeing

the forme of a man. By which words, S. Paule ment not that
Christ was like vnto God, and not God indéede, nor yet was
like vnto man, and not verie man indéed: but that he was and
is verie God and verie man, hauing two substances, one of his
godhead, and the other of his manhood, vnited together in one
person. And the auncient Doctors writing of this Sacrament,
when they speake of the formes of bread and wine, do vse this
vocable (Forme) as S. Paule vseth it, to signifie the verie bread
and verie wine, or the substaunce of bread and wine, & not the
similitude or likenesse of bread & wine, without the substance,
as you fantasie and imagine.

should haue followed, stedfast continuance. Yet is he not excusable,
which receiued so much, that of his owne will, he hath
thought his owne destruction. And there was no necessitie to
compell God to giue him anie other then a meane will, and a
fraile will, that of mans fall he might gather matter for his

                  We had frée-will before sinne,Chrisostō
                      to worke well, but after sin
we had none, because we were not able by our owne power and
strength after sinne, to escape from the power of ye. diuel: but as
a ship when the sterne is broken, is driuen hether and thether,
where the tempest will, so by the diuell we are domen from one:
sinne to another, neither hetherto can doe anie thing, but euen
as the diuell will. And except God deliuer of with his strong
hande of his mercie, we shall remaine in bondes and chaines of
sinnes vnto death.
Chrisostome in his 36. hom.
                  
                  That man of his naturall power without the spirit of God
can doe nothing but sin, is proued by the words of Christ himselfe.
He that abideth in me (saith Christ) bringeth foorth much
fruite, for without me can ye doe nothing: If a man bide not
in me, he is cast out as a braunch and he shall burne. Héere it
is plaine, that frée-will without grace can doe nothing that is
acceptable before God: Saint Austen
                     Augustin vpon this place of Iohn
                     Iohn. 15. 5.
saith, Least anie man should suppose, that the braunch of it self,
could bring foorth at the least waie a little friute, therefore saith
he not, Without me can ye doe a little: but, Without me can
ye doe nothing. Therefore, whether it be little or much, without
me it can not be done. One of two must the braunches
néedes doe, either abide in the Uine, or els burne in the Fire.
If it be not in the Uine, then it is in the Fire.
D. Barnes.
                  
                  What goodnesse can he doe (saith S. Austen) that is loft except
he be deliuered from his miserie.Augustin Can he doe anie good by his
frée-will? God forbid. For man euill vsing his frée-will, did both
loose himselfe, and also his frée-will. And as man béeing aliue,
doth kill himselfe, and when he hath killed himselfe, he can not
make himselfe aliue againe: so likwise when wée doe sinne by
Frée-will, and sinne hath the victorie, then is frée-will cleere
lost. For of whom a man is ouercome, vnto him must hée bée
seruaunt.
                  Saint Austen declaring what goodnesse frée-will deserueth
without grace,Augustin saith: Oh cursed frée-wil without God. We haue
experience what Frée-will is able to do without God. Behold,
man was made good, and by his Free-will, was made an

euill man. What shall an euill man by his frée-will forsaking
God, make a man good,Make good. he beeing good, could not kéep himselfe
good. And now that he is euill, shall hée make himselfe
good, when that he was good, he kept not himselfe good, and now
that he is euill, shall I saie, I make my selfe good, &c. Héere is
the verie strength of frée-will, by his strength are we made miserable,
and that doth experience learne.
D. Barnes,
                  
                  Saint Paule saith,2. Cor. 3. 5. that we are not sufficiient to thinke anie
thing of our selues, as it were of our selues, but our sufficiencie
is of God. ¶Saint Barnard vpon this place saith, what
shall we saie (saith he) is this alonelie all the merite of Fréewill,
that he doth alonelie consent? Yea doubtlesse: not that
that same consent, in the which is all his merite, is not of
God,
                        
                           〈…〉
                        
                      whē we can neither think, ye which is lesse then to consent
anie thing of our selues, as though we were sufficient of our
selues. These words be not mine, but the Apostles, the which
giueth vnto God, & not vnto Frée-will, all manner thing that
can be good, S. Barnard giueth vnto God. Now what strength
hath frée-will, he can neither thinke good nor will, nor yet perfourme
it. And there is nothing, but either it is included, in
thinking, in willing or in perfourming, and all these he giueth
to God.
D. Barnes.
                  
                  Thrée blessings there are,Barnard in his 39. scene. of his litle S. which are necessarie to vs: the
first is, preuenting: the second is, helping: the third is, of glorie.
He doth preuent our conuersation by mercie: he helpeth
our conuersation by his grace: he doth accomplish our ending

it is God that worketh in vs, to work according to his godlie
pleasure. This is behoouefull for vs, both to beléeue and speak:
This is a godlie, this is a true doctrine, that our confession may

                     Man before his fall had frée-will: but after his fall, both hée
in himselfe, and in all his prosteritie, vtterlie lost that frée will.
So that man can now with nothing of himselfe that is good or
acceptable before God. All the abhominations of the thoughtes
of mens hearts are euill. Gen. 6. 5. and 8. 21. Out of the corrupt
heart of man proceedeth all wickednesse. Math. 15. 19. We are
not apt of our selues to thinke anie thing that perteineth to the
glorie of God. 2. Cor. 3. 5. It is the grace and goodnesse of God
that worketh altogether, whatsoeuer is good in vs, for it is
neither of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God
onelie that sheweth the mercie. He that doth beleeue, doth beléeue
willinglie, and of his owne accorde, but that he hath
a will to beléeue, is not of himselfe, but of GOD, for GOD
doth not onelie offer mercie to our wil, but also giueth vs a wil
to receiue it: As Saint Paule testifieth: God worketh in vs
both to wil and to persorme whatsoeuer is good, and perteining
to saluation. Philip. 2. 13. And where God giueth not a wil, ther
cannot men beleeue, though grace and mercie be offered vnto
them. As in Iohn. 12. 37.
                  
                  Without the grace of God,Augustin 
                     Adam could not be good, yea,
though he had free-wil: Wherefore God woulde not leaue him
without his grace, although he left him in his fréew-ill, because
that frée-will is sufficient to doe euill: but to good it is but of
smal value, if it be not aided with the goodnesse of ye almightie:
which aide if man had not forsaken through his frée-will, he had
bene alwaies good: but he did forsake it, wherefore he was also
forsaken.

                  The counsell of Milenitan, in two Canons.
                  Frée-wil weakened to the first man,Canon. 1. cannot be repaired and
amended, but through the grate of Baptime, the which after
that it is lost, cannot be restored againe, but by him which hath
power to giue it; wherefore the truth saith, If the son make you
frée, then are you frée indéede.
                  The second Canon saith:Canon. 2. God doth worke so in the hearts
of men, and to frée-will that if there be anie godlie cogitation,
anie deliberation tending to the honour of God, and anie motion
of good will all the same procéedeth from God. For by him
we maie doe some good thing, and without him we can doe nothing.
                  
                     What hast thou that thou hast not receiued?Saint Barnard of free-will. Art thou created?
Art thou healed? Art thou saued? Which of them hast
thou of thy selfe? Which of thē is not impossible for frée-will?
Thou couldest not create thy selfe when thou wast not made:
nor iustifie thy selfe when thou wast a sinner, &c.
               
               
                  Examples how God ordereth mans will.
                  God sayd to Abimelech king of Gerar, concerning Abrahams
wife, I kept thée also that thou shouldest not sinne against mee,
and therefore suffered thée not to touch her. Gen. 20. 6.
                  
                  Be not afraide (saith Ioseph to his brethren) can we resist
the will of God? You deuised euill against me, but God turned
it to good. Gen. 50. 19.
                  
                  God saith thus of Pharao: I will harden his heart: And in
the 33. 19. of the same booke he said: I wil shew mercie and haue
compassion of whom it pleaseth me. Exo. 4. 21.
                  
                  A man maie prepare his heart, but it is God that gouerneth
the tongue. Pro. 16. 1.
                  
                  I knowe (O Lord) that it is not in mans power to order his

fault with the Corinthians that sayde: I holde of Apollo, I
holde of Paule, I holde of Peter: but the Catholikes say, thou
art Peter, and vpon this foundation, the pillers of the Church,
which are ye Bishops are sure set. And so deuising an other foundation
beside Christ, and contrarie to S. Paules doctrine, would
haue all the Bishops of the world holde of Peter.

9. where he saith: This day haue I taken the shame of Aegypt

                     Euse. Eccle. Hist. lib. 1. Chap. 6. mencioneth the heresie of the
Galileans out of Iosephus, to haue spronge vp of one Iudas
Galileus in the time of Augustus, when Cyrenius was President
of Iudaea, and vnder the sayde Emperour, of an other
called Symon Galileus vnder Copinius the President. They
exhorted the Iewes to a lawelesse and carnall libertie, affirming
that Taxe and Tribute, was nothing else but slauish
seruitude. They misliked moreouer with the Iewes, that they
suffered mortall men vnder God to reigne ouer them. Of the
same opinion were the Galileans, in the time of Pilate, vnder
the Emperour Tiberius. Wherefore Iudas (as Iosephus writeth)
was hanged together with his complises. Symon came
to naught, and Pilate rewarded them vnder him as rebells

to set before them. There by the name of Gates, all kinde
of force and munition is noted. And by hell gates, all Satanicall
and diuellish power is to be vnderstoode. These promises are
great and most firme, which doe pacifie and comfort the consciences
of the faithfull, when they consider themselues to bée so
setteled and graunted, that they knowe for a suretie how they
are able to resist all the power of Satan, according to the saieng
of Saint Paule: There is no condemnation to those that
are in Christ Iesu. And if God be with vs, who can be against
vs, who spared not his owne sonne, but gaue him for vs, howe
then should he not with him giue vs all things, who shall laie
anie thing to the charge of Gods chosen, &c.

in the person of God, saieng: Thou gauest me not the younge

should not be offered vnto other Gods, but vnto me. Of whose

                  GEntlenesse is, when a man is gentle and tractable in his
conuersation, and in his whole lyfe. For such as will bée
true followers of the Gospell, must not be sharpe & bitter, but
gentle, milde, curteous, and faire spoken, which shoulde encourage
other to delite in their companie: which can winke
at other mens faultes, or at least, expounde them to the
best. Which will bée well content to yéelde and giue place
to other, contented to beare with those, which are frowarde
and intractable, as the verie Heathen saide: Thou maist know
the manners of thy friend; but thou must not hate them. Such
a one was our sauiour Christ, as euerie wher is to be séene in
the Gospell. It is written of Peter, that he wept so often as
he remembred the swéet mildnesse of Christ which he vsed in
his dailie conuersation. It is an excellent vertue and most necessarie
in euerie kinde of lyfe.

courses by good fellowes and companions, wherein men passe
the boundes of all shame. For euerie one of the guests thinketh
that to be his feast: And therefore he dareth both speake and
doe whatsoeuer he thinketh good, but hée which is bidden to an
others table, is commonlie brideled with some modestie and
shamefastnesse not to presume to speake anie thing that is
vncomelie. And peraduenture Iob feared least the feast of his
children were such manner of feasts, and therefore he dailie sacrificed
vnto God for them. And what is wont to happen at such
riotous feasts the head of Iohn Baptist declareth, which was
giuen to that wanton and dissolute maiden. And howe greate
the outragiousnesse of men was, and especiallie of the elders amongest
the Ethniks, it maie héereby be knowne, for that when
they had well dronke, they were wont hauing garlands on
their heads, and minstrels with them, to go in banketting from
place to place, as wanton and young folke, to speake and to doe
what they lysted, so that oftentimes they fell to vncleane
acts, and to contentions, as Paule héere declareth. Which thing

children newlie borne from their mothers, and cutting them

burned the bodies into Ashes, which they did mixe with the

is knowne in Iesus Christ, for whosoeuer doth not acknowledge
him in Iesus Christ, knoweth him not at all. All
other Gods that men doe call Gods, are no Gods all,
but onlie by the imagination of men. And therefore it is that
Paule did write to the Ephesians, y• the Pagans were without

                     It is in Timothie,
                     1. Tim. 4. 10 how God is called the sauiour of all
men, and especiallie of the faithfull: In which wordes, this
word Thotes, that is, sauiour, is to be taken, not as though God
giueth to all men saluation
                        •
                      but as it signifieth, that he preserueth
and defendeth all men from manie euills, which otherwise
the Diuell practiseth against them. For so greate is his
rage against mankinde,Sauiour of all men that if he were not restrained he would
destroie all things, he wold suffer no cōmonwealth nor church,
but would bring to naught both goods and all things, whatsoeuer
pertaine to mans life. Wherefore in such sort is God the
sauiour of all men, in that he driueth awaie so great euils from
all men. But as touching eternall saluation, that is to be vnderstoode
of the elect onelie. And therefore it is added, and especiallie
of the faithful. For, forasmuch as they are predstinate, they
aboue all other attaine vnto this benefit, &c.

                  Some doe thinke God to bée almightie,Almighty because he can doe
all things, and then it should follow that he were not almightie.
For all things he cannot doe. He cannot saue the vnfaythfull,
hée cannot restore virglnitie once violated, saith Saint
Thomas and also Hierome, writing to Paule and Eustachinum.
He cannot sinne saith. Dunce. He cannot denie himselfe saith
Saint Paule. Now if these mens learning were allowed, then
might not God bee almightie, because there is somewhat that
he cannot doe. But they that are accustomed with the Scripture
doth knowe that he is called almightie, not because hee
can do all thinges, but because ther is no superiour aboue him,
but y• he maie do all that hée will, and all that his pleasure isto
doe, that may he bring to passe, and no power is able to resist
him. But he hath no pleasure to make himselfe a lyar, nor to

make his Scripture false. And yet notwithstanding he abideth
almightie, for he maie doe all things that he will.

                  How God did forknowe the fall of Adam, and
yet was not the cause thereof.
                  A prudent Father doth foresée by some outward tokens,
that his sonne will one daie come to an euill ending. Neither
is he deceiued in his foresight, for he is slaine béeing in adulterie.
But he is not slaine because his Father foresaw that he
would be slaine,Foreknovvledge of God. but because he was an adulterer. And therefore
Saint Austen or whosoeuer it is that was the authour of
the second booke, De Gentium vocatione, Chap. 4. speaking of
the murther which Caine committed, saith: God veril
                        •
                     e did
fore-knowe to what ende the furie of that madde man
would come, and yet because Gods foreknowledge could not be
deceiued, it doth not therevpon followe that necessitie of sinning
did vrge the crime vpon him, &c. S. Austen de libero arbitrio.
li. 3. Chap. 4. saith: As thou by thy memorie doest not
compel those things to be done, y• are gone & past, so God by his
foreknowledge doth not compell those things to be done which
are to come. And as thou remembrest some thinges that thou
hast done, and yet hast not done all things which thou remembrest:
so God foreknoweth all things which he doth, not and yet
doth not all things which he foreknoweth. But God is a iust
reuenger of that whereof he is no euill authour, and so foorth.

mockage and laughter, for he reioyseth not in the hurte of
man, but at his amendemen

                     . For God abhorreth scornefull
personnes, but as that man which laugheth at other
men, is farthest from a minde to helpe them, and to remedie
their griefes, so is God to such as despise his commaundement,

Lord looked:Looke. that is, he was pleased with Abel and his Offering,

                  How God cannot be shut vp in a Pixe.
                  God is infinite,Pixe. incomprehensible, vnmeasurable, higher then
the high heauens, iower then the déepe bottomlesse waters: he
measureth the wide world with his spanne, and conteineth all
enclosed in his fist. With him y• light dwelleth, & the sun beams
are at his ordering. By him is ruled light and darknesse, life
and death, and all together. Wherefore when thou canst inclose
in a Bore, the raging Seas: when thou canst pinne vp the
Sunne (béeing but a creature) in thy Pixe, then will I graunt
thée to haue power ouer things infinite and incomprehensible.
                  In the meane time, I must take it impossible by carnall capacitie:
and also by spirituall iudgment, grounded vpon the word
of God and by the gift of reason, whereby all men considering
the worke of God in the creation, maie know their Creator to
excell all creatures farre, and that he can therefore be made by
no creature, much lesse can he lie inclosed in a Boxe of an inche
and an halfe déepe, when the Priest will mumble vppe foure
wordes in a corner: and there bée tied till he waxe foistie, vnlesse
the Priest loose him.

                  How God is not chaunged.
                  If I shall speake euill against anie Nation (saith the Lord)
and that Nation shall repent, I will also repent me of that euill
which I said I would doe. And that Ieremie might more manifestlier
vnderstande the things that were spoken, he bad him
goe into the house of the Potter, where he saw the Potter make
a vessell of claie, which was broken in the handes of the workman.
But the Potter made againe another vessell of the same
claie. So saith the Lord, if they repent, I will also repent: I
do now make for them euill things, but for euill things I will
make good.Not changed. And yet as I haue said, he changeth not his sentence,
because such threatenings and promises doe depend vpon a condition
which is sometimes chaunged, when as God abideth the
selfe same. Of this thing right well writeth Chrisostome vpon
Genesis in his 25. homelie: The Lord commanded Noe to build
an Arke, & threatened that after an 120. yeres, he wold destroie
all mankinde by a floud: but when in the meane time, they nothing
at all profited, he cut off 20. yeres, & sent the floud in y• hundred
yeare, and yet was not God chaunged, but the conditions
of men veried. The same Chrisostome also vpon Math. in his
65. homelie, when he interpreteth this: Uerelie I saie vnto you,
ye which haue forsaken all things, &c. demaundeth: Was not
Iudas one of the twelue? And shall Iudas sit vppon the seates,
and iudge the twelue Tribes of Israel? Did Christ chaunge
his sentence? No (saith he) but Iudas was chaunged. Which
selfe same thing, we must iudge of the citie of Niniue, & of King
Ezechias, whom God pronounced should die. For neither Niniue
at that time perished, nor Ezechias di
                        •
                     d, because they were
changed. God said at the beginning, that the feare of man, shuld
be vpon beasts: but it happeneth contrarie. For men are now
afraid of Lions, Beares and Tigers, because they are of them
oftentimes torne: but that commeth héereof, because the condition
of men is chaunged, and not the councell of God.

sinner, yet while he was a sinner, he did praie and confesse his
sinnes, that he might be iustified, and being heard, he was iustified
that he might cease to be a sinner: and trulie he should not
cease to be a sinner, vnlesse he were heard being yet a sinner.
                  ¶This place doth not so meane, that God will heare no
sinners, that is alwaies readie to repent, but of such as will neuer
repent, but still continue in their sinnes.
                  We must vnderstande, that there be two kinde of sinners:
They that acknowledge their sinnes and repent vnfainedlie, are
heard and forgiuen of God. Math. 9. 13. and. 28. Eze. 18. 21. But
they that doe of an infidelitie continue, in their sinfull abhominable
liuing, and despaire of the mercie of God, shall neuer bée
heard. Iohn. 5. 16.

                  How Gods ordinaunce may not be broken.
                  There were some orders in the Primatiue Church commanded
by God,Ordināce and some there were deuised by man, for the better
training of the people. Such orders as were commaunded by
God, maie in no wise be chaunged, onlie because God commanded
them. For as God is euerlasting, so is his word & commandement
euerlasting. On the other side, such orders as hath bene
deuised by men, maie be broken vppon some good consideration,
onelie because they were men that deuised them. For as they
be mortall, so all their wisedomes and iudgements be but mortall.
And so indéede, as touching such things as hath bene ordeined
by men, we are not bound of necessitie to the order of the
Church: but such things as God hath commaunded preciselie
by his worde, maie not bée broken, by anie custome or consent.

                     Leo the first of that name in his sermon of the Passion of
of the Lord, saith, that Peter when he cut off the eare of the seruaunt
of the high Priest, was moued with a godly motion, but
what godly motion could it be, which Christ reproued, yea, &
so reproued it, that he affirmed, y• he which so drew the sword,
shuld perish with ye sword. What other thing was this then to
haue a zeale of God, but(as Paul saith) not according to knowledge.
Paule also the Apostle, when he afflicted and destroied
the Christians, thought that he did God high seruice.

                  ¶The Gospell, after S. Iohn Euangelion, signifieth good tidings.
And in the holy writers it signifieth a publique, solemne
and open preaching of Christ whereby his death hath purged
our sinnes, and being risen from the dead, raineth in the ha
                        •
                     ts
of his chosen, and renueth them vnto godlines, through his spirit,
mortifieng from time to time their foolish lusts, and abolishing
more and more the remnaunt of their naturall corruption,
and this indéede is verie good tidings, for heereby we are
deliuered from the fear
                        •
                      of death and damnation, and from the
bondage of sinne and Satan. Briefelie héereby we are remoued
from darknesse to light, from despaire to good hope, from
death to life, from Hell to Heauen. Now because the office
of proclaiming and publishing this most ioifull tidings was
committed to the Ministers of the newe Testament, the
name of the Euangelists is most properlie attributed vnto
them, and speciallie to those, that the Natiuitie,

conuersation, death, resurrection of the Lord Iesus, wherin the
blesfulnesse resteth, that we sée so much aduaunced. Some writers
affirme, that as manie promises of felicitie and saluation
as there is, so manie Gospells there bée, and that therefore the
Prophets are Euangelists. When they speake of the redemption
that Gods annointed shoulde accomplish. I thinke it not
good to striue about words, and I denie not that the Hebrewe
word Bassac, which signifieth the Euangelize, and to preach good
tidings, is applied in some place to y• men of y• olde time, howbeit,
I beléeue rather, that Euangelion is an open publishing of
saluation alredie performed and accomplished, then of the same
promised. And therfore they speake more distinctlie and properlie,
that giue the name of Euangelists to the Apostles, and writers
of the histories of the Lord Iesus, and finallie to the ministers
of the new Testament And to giue place rather to this
iudgement, the wordes of our Sauiour in the. 16. of Luke, moueth
me, where he saith. That the Law and the Prophets were
vntill Iohn Baptist, and from that time the kingdome of God
was Euangelized.

                  What is meant by the Gospell preached to the dead.
                  For vnto this purpose verilie was the Gospel preached vnto
the dead:1. Pet. 4. 6. that they should be iudged like other men in the
flesh, but shall liue before God in the spirit. ¶As certeine learned
expositours will,To the Dead. that he héere calleth preaching of the Gospell
vnto the dead, in the chapter going next before, The preaching
to the spirits that were in prison, which thing (saie they)
signifie as much as vnto the dead also, or spirits in prison, came
that salue of medicine of the Gospell, and of the glad tidings of
Christs passion, whereby they were loosed, the strength thereof
béeing so pithie that they were therwith brought out of prison,
to immortalitie. And because it might haue bene demaunded,
how y• soules of these blessed came out of prison, whether compassed
with their bodies, or onely in pure substaunce of y• spirit?
Therfore saith Peter, that they should be iudged like other men
in the fleshe, that is, when all other men shall be iudged in
the flesh, but should liue before God in the spirit, which signifieth
that in the meane season til that iudgement come, shal their
soule liue and re

Saint Austen, aunswere mée whether you thinke greater the
worde of God or the bodie of Christ, if you will aunswere the
truth, verilie you ought to saie thus, that the worde of GOD
is no lesse then the bodye of Chrst. And therefore with what
carefulnesse wée take héede when the bodie of Christ is ministred
vnto vs, that no parte fall thereof out of our owne hands
on the earth: with as greate carefulnesse, lette vs take héede
that the worde of God which is ministred vnto vs, when wée
thinke or speak of vaine matters, perish not out of our hearts,
for he that heareth the worde of God negligentlie, shall bee
guiltie of no lesse faulte, then he that suffereth the bodye of
Chrst, to fall vpon the ground through his negligence.

                  Whether the booke or leaues of the booke,
be the Gospell.
                  By the authoritie of Saint Hierome, the Gospell is not
the Gospell, for reading of the letter, but for the beliefe that
men haue in the worde of GOD. That it is the Gospell that
we beléeue, and not the letter that we reade. For because the
letter that is touched with mans hande, is not the Gospell, but
the sentence that is verilie beléeued in mans hearte, is the Gospell.
For so Saint Hierome saith. The Gospell that is the vertue
of Gods word, is not in the leaues of the bookes, but it is in
the roote of reason. Neither the Gospell (he sayth) is in the writing
aboue of the letters, but the Gospell is in the marking of
the sentence of Scriptures. This sentence approueth Saint
Paule, saieng thus: The kingdome of God is not in worde, but
in vertue, and Dauid saith: The voice of the Lorde, that is, his
worde, is in vertue. And after Dauid saith: Through the worde
of God, the heauens were made. And in the spirit of his mouth,

is all the vertue of them.

                  The true definition of grace.
                  The true definition of Grace, and agréeing to the holy scriptures
is, the free beneuolence of God, whereby he counteth vs
déere in Christ Iesus, and forgiueth vs our sinnes, giueth the
holie Ghost, an vpright life, and eternall felicitie: by this definition
is séene, not onlie what we call grace, but also by whom
we haue it, and with all the principall effects thereof.

all the Epistles of Paule, taken for the fauour and frée mercie
of God, whereby he saueth vs fréelie without anie desertes or
workes of the lawe. In like maner peace is taken for the tranquilitie
of the conscience, being fullie perswaded, that through
the merites of Christs death and bloud-shedding, there is an
attonement and peace made betwéene God and vs, so that God
will no more impute our sinnes vnto vs, nor yet condemne vs.

                  What it is to reiect grace.
                  To reiect and refuse the grace of God,Grace reiect. is to séeke righteousnesse
by the law, or to deserue grace by our owne righteousnes.
               
               
                  What difference is betweene grace and gift.
                  Grace properlie is Gods fauour, beneuolence, or kind mind,
which of his owne selfe without deseruing of vs, he beareth

vnto vs, wherby he was moued & inclined to giue Christ vnto
vs,Grace & Gift. with all his other gifts of grace. Gift, is the holie Ghost &
his working, whom he powreth into the hearts of thē, on whom
he hath mercie, & whom he fauoureth. Though the gifts of y• spirit
increase in vs dailie, & haue not yet the full perfection, yea,
& though there remaine in vs yet euill lusts & sinne, which fight
against the spirit, as he saith héere in the seauenth Chapter,
and in the fift to the Galathians, and as it was spoken before,
in the third Chapter of Genesis, of the debate betwéene the
womans seede, and the séede of the Serpent, yet neuerthelesse
GODS fauour is so greate and so strong ouer vs for Christs
sake, that wee are counted for full, whole, and perfect before
God. For Gods fauour towardes vs, diuideth not her selfe, increasing
a lyttle and little as doe the giftes, but receyueth
vs whole and altogether in full loue for Christes sake our
intercessour and Mediatour. And because the giftes of the
spirite, and the battell betwéene the spirite and euill lustes
are begunne in vs alreadie. Of this nowe vnderstande thou
the. 7. Chapter, where Paule accuseth himselfe as a sinner, and
yet in the 8. Chapter sayth, There is no dampnation to them
that are in Christ, and that because of the spirite, and because
the gifts of the spirite are begunne. Sinners wée are
because the flesh is not full killed and mortified. Neuerthelesse
in as much as we beléeue in Christ, and haue the earnest and
beginning of the spirite, and woulde faine bée perfect. GOD
is so louing and fauourable vnto vs, that he will not looke
on such sin, neither will count it as sinne, but will deale with
vs according to our beliefe in Christ, and according to his promises
which hée hath sworne to vs, vntill the sinne bée full
slaine in vs, and mortified by death.

                  The difference betweene grace and
the Lawe.
                  
                     Chrisostome noteth certeine diefferences, betwéene
the Lawe and Grace. The Lawe (sayth hée) setteth 
                        •
                     oorth a
Crowne, but first requireth workes and battailes. Grace
first crowneth,Grace & lawe. and afterwarde bringeth vnto the battayle.
                  By this hée teacheth that the righteousnesse which is set forth

the Lawe, is obteined by workes, for wée cannot bée iustified
by the lawe, vnlesse wée haue accomplished, all the thinges
which are commaunded in the lawe. But that other righteousnesse
which wée haue by grace through fayth, doth first
crowne vs with a newe generation and adoption to be the
children of GOD: And wée béeing regenerate, it bringeth vs
forth to battaile, and vnto good workes. Héerevnto Chrisostome
addeth, the lawe reproueth, but loseth not from sinne.
Grace loseth from sinne, and reproueth not. The lawe reproueth
sinne, and increaseth it: Grace forgiuing it, suffereth vs
not to be vnder sinne, &c.

                  How this following is vnderstoode.
                  And of his fulnesse haue all wée receiued euen Grace for
Grace.Iohn. 1. 16 ¶This sentence is sundrie wise expounded. I will first
shew you Saint Austens minde. These be his words vpon this
place: That brethren all we haue receiued out of his fulnesse,
out of the fulnesse of his mercie haue we receiued, what?
Remission of sinnes, that we might be iustified by fayth.
                  And what moreouer? Grace for Grace,Grace for Grace. that is to witte:
For this Grace whereby we liue of Fayth, we shall receiue
an other Grace, namelie, Euerlasting lyfe. But what
else is it saue Grace? For if I shall saie this is due to me, I
assigne somewhat to my selfe, as to whome it is due. But
GOD crowneth the giftes of his mercie in vs. Thus yée sée
Saint Austens meaning, to witte, that all good giftes, and in
the ende, euerlasting lyfe is not a recompence of our merites,
but commeth of the frée liberalitie of God, because it pleaseth
him so to reward his former graces, and to crowne his owne
gyftes in vs. And so hée calleth faith whereby wée are iustified
one Grace, and euerla
                        •
                     ing lyfe an other grace, verye
truelie and godlye to the confusion of the common Idolles
Souldiers. Other expounding Grace for Grace, Grace vppon
Grace, teach that out of this fulnesse of his sonne, GOD
gaue to our Fathers vnder the olde Testament the spirite
of feare, whereby as children vnd
                        •
                     r a Schoolemaster

they were kept in and restrained, that they shoulde not
stray abroad after fleshlie lusts, but be ledde foorth and framed
to some goodnesse. And in the new Testament, hée giueth the
spirit of fréedome, whereby with more franke and free hearts, &
with more ioifull courage by the motion of the spirit, we doe
the thing that pleaseth God, not that our Fathers were altogether
voide of this frée spirit, but because of their childlie age,
they were kept more vnder by feare, & the spirite was not so
richlie & larglie giuen to them as to vs, I meane vniuersallie,
touching gods ordinarie disposition. For to some speciall person
the spirit was larglie giuen, and more larglie then it is nowe.
The exposition of other is, that God loueth and fauoureth vs,
because of the loue and fauour that he beareth to his sonne, as
Saint Paule writeth, That he hath made vs acceptable in the
beloued. For by nature we are the children of wrath, & the loue
and fauour that we finde in Gods sight, is for that of his own
goodnesse he hath made vs the members of his most dearelye
beloued sonne, and so loueth vs, as a parte of his sonnes bodie.
Other thinke that the meaning of these words is, that GOD
powreth all his graces into the Lorde Iesus, and by him conueieth
the same vnto vs, as by a Conduct pipe

                  By grace vnderstand fauour. The meaning is, for the fauour

vs into fauour. So as Christ is beloued of his Father,
euen so are we beloued for his sake. Rom. 5. 15.

                  The grace (saith Saint Austen) which is giuen of the largnesse
of God priuilie into mans heart, cannot be despised of no
manner of hard heart, for therfore it is giuen, that the hardnesse
of the heart shalbe taken awaie. Wherefore when the father is
herde within, and doth learne that he must come vnto his sonne,
then taketh he awaie our stonie heart, and giueth vs a fleshlie
heart, & by this meanes he maketh vs his children of promise,
and the vessels of mercie, which he hath prepared to glorie. But
wherefore doth he not learne all men to come to Christ: because
that those y• he learneth, he learneth of mercie, and those that he
learneth not, of his iudgement doth he not learne them.
               
               
                  These places following are alleadged of D. Barnes
against Free will.
                  Saint Austen saith,Austen against Dunce. that there is no hardnesse of heart, that
can resist grace. Dunce saith, that there maie bée an obstacie
in mans heart.
                  S. Austen saith, that grace findeth the heart in hardnesse and
obstinacie. But Dunce saith, that there is a mollifieng that precedeth
grace, which is called attrition.
                  Saint Austen saith, when the Father learneth vs within,
then taketh he awaie our stonie hearts. But Dunce saith, that
we can doe it by the common naturall influence, that is, wée
can dispose our selues of congruence.
                  Saint Austen saith, how all men be not taught to come
to Christ, but onelie they that be taught of mercie be taught,
and if it be of mercie, then it is not of congruence by attrition.
               
               
                  The meaning of these places
following.
                  For by grace are ye saued through faith.Ephe. 2. 8. ¶So then grace,
that is to saie, the gift of God and Faith, doe stande one with

an other, to which two these be contrarie, to be saued by our
selues or by our workes. Therefore what meane they, which
would ioine together things of so contrarie nature.

                  And grace for grace.Iohn. 1. 16 ¶This place is diuerslie expounded.
Some vnderstand the first grace to be that, by y• which through
faith we receiue remission of our sinnes, the other grace to bée
lyfe euerlasting, the which kinde of Grace is giuen to the
faithfull, according to the saieng of the Apostle: but the grace
of God is eternall life.Grace for Grace. 
                     Rom. 6. 23. But other some will haue
the first to bée that, which in the olde Testament was giuen
to the Iewes: The other to be more copious and large, and
giuen to all men. But the simple sence and meaning of the
text séemeth to be this, that whatsoe
                        •
                     er graces God doth poure
vpon vs, they doe also spring from this Well. For whatsoeuer
we doe receiue of Christ, he doth not onelie giue it vnto vs as
GOD, but also the Father hath so giuen all things into the
handes of Christ, that whatsoeuer we receiue from GOD,
they come to vs by Christ, as by a conduct Pipe. They iudge
therefore rightlie, which saie that we are watered by the graces
powred vpon Christ. This was the anointing with the
which he was anointed, and that he might anoint vs all
with him, wherevpon he is called Christ, that is to saie, anointed,
and we Christians, that is to saie, anointed by him, &c.

off. First, the children of the faythfull, vnto whome by
the vertue of the couenaunt that is made with the Fathers,
the promise doth perteine, are graffed in. Secondlye, they are
graffed in, that receiue the séede of the Gospel, but before it can
bring forth anie fruite, it is choked in them. Thirdlie, they bée
graffed in, that by the vnchangeable purpose or decrée of God,
are ordeined and chosen to lyfe euerlasting. Now, the first are
cutte off, when they doe vnfaithfullie refuse the promise that
is made vnto their Fathers, or els will not of a certeine malicious

minde receiue it. The second are cut off, when the séede
is choked in them.

                  GRiefe as saith Cicero in his Tusculane questions, is a disease
which vexeth the minde, and it is taken by reason of
the euill which séemeth to be alreadie at hande, and to bée present.
For y• disease which is taken for an euil, which is come, is
not called griefe but feare. If a man demand from whēce this
griefe springeth, I answere, from loue. For when it goeth euill
with them, to whom we would good, we begin to be grieued.
But if vnto them whom we care not for, or who are not déere
vnto vs, there happen anie misfortune, that is not customablye
grieuesome vnto vs.

                           •
                        6. ¶He saith not, no
man ought to be chiefe among you, which he should haue
said, If it had not bene lawfull in the kingdome of God, for
some to bée greate and chiefe, or if it had béene necessarie that
all should haue ben in all things equall. The celestiall spirits
be not equall: The Starres be not equall: The Apostles themselues
be not equall: Peter is found in manie places, to bée
the chiefe amonge the rest, which wée doe not denie. Therefore
this is not the meaning of Christ, to haue none greate or
chiefe among Christians, séeing the verie necessitie of our state
requireth, that some be superiours and betters, so farre it is
from béeing repugnant to charitie. In like manner there must
be in the Church Gouernours, Presidents, Rulers, of whome
Paule maketh mention. Rom. 13. l. Cor. 12. 28. Heb. 13. 17. And
there is also in the bodie some principall members, some inferiour,
&c. Therefore Christ doth not require that in his kingdome
all should be equall, but this he doth require. That none
should desire to be greate, or to be thought or counted chiefe.

feared for authoritie and power? And yet who euer serued mo,
more diligentlie and more humblie, which neuer sought anie

so beare office, and rule the workes of the hands of the Lord,
and gouerne the Shéepe of his pasture according to his will,
what doth hée else but serue all those whome he gouerneth.
                  And therefore Christ doth not héere dehort from bearing rule
and béeing a Magistrate, but from

                     éeking rule and dominion,
For I had rather take this saieng of the Lorde in this generalitie,
then to restraine it to the Apostles onelie: Eo quod
omninus pius, &c. Because a godlie Magistrate doth altogether
serue and not beare rule, and hath by himselfe all things agreeable
to this present exhortation of the Lord.

permit him vnto himselfe: that is, he leaueth man vnto his
owne corrupt nature, according vnto the which, the hart of man
is stonie, which is onlie mollified and made tractable by the onelie
grace of God: therefore the withdrawing of Gods grace, is
the hardening of mans hart, and when we are left to our selues,

                  THose that doe write of the nature of beasts doe saie, that an
Hart among other his peculiar properties, hath a great desire
aboue all other beasts to the waters, and that for thrée causes:
One is for the quenching of his thirst, and that desire is common
to him with all other beasts: he hath also a naturall desire
to the water when he is hot and chafed with the chasing of dogs,
and that for two causes: One the colde water cooleth his heat,
and refresheth his strength: Secondlie, the water by the meanes
of his readinesse and aptnesse to swimme, doth not onelie sette
him forward and giueth him a vauntage before the dogs, but
also doth sometime thereby deceiue the Hounds, and sometime
defendeth him against the 
                        •
                     ray-hounds. So that the Hart being
chased and in daunger of his

                     , hearesorteth by and by for

                        •
                      comfort and defence, Ad 
                           〈…〉
                         aquarum, vnto the water
springs, vnto the Brookes or Riuers. Our Hunters (I trowe)
tearme it not to call it the water Springs, but they call it the
Sound. The Stagge saie they, got him to the Sound, and there
the Hounds made a fault, and had l
                        •

                     lie leaped into the water, and
on the other side, tried which waie he was gone, and so followed
the chase afresh. Beside these two great causes, why the Hart
desireth the water, there is yet another, as great as anie of the
other two, but not so well knowen to the most part of men, as
the other be. In Affrike and other hot Countries where many
Serpents be, there is a naturall enmitie betwéene the Harte
and them, and as soone as the Hart hath deuoured the Serpent,
the poyson of the Serpent doth cast the Hart into such a feruent
heate, that it causeth him to haue a meruailous desire to the
water, without which the Hart must néede die. Such a loue
ought all men haue to godlinesse, and to runne to God for succour,
when they be poysoned with the venime of sinne, or oppressed

with anie kinde of trouble: as the Hart hath 
                        〈…〉
                      runne
to the water Springs, when he is chased with Dogges, or poysoned
with Serpents. So that they maie saie with the Prophet
Dauid, As the Hart desireth the water Springs, so my
soule desireth thée, O Lord.

habitation of this child shall be light, and his word a demonstration,

                  I thought I shoulde haue gone to the gates of Hell,Esa. 38. 10 in my
best age. ¶That is, I thought I should haue gone downe to
my graue, and haue died in my best age. The Hebrue word signifieth
both Hell and a graue, pit or ditch. That ye may perceiue
in Gen. 42. 38. where Iacob saith, that if any misfortune should
happen to Beniamin in his iournie into Aegypt with his other
bretheren, his graie head should be brought with sorrowe vnto
his Graue, where the common Translation readeth Hell for
graue. As for Hezekia he neither feared Hell nor Purgatorie,
as ye maie well sée, by that he a little before saith.
                  
                     Remember O Lord, that I haue walked before thée in truth
and a stedfast hart, and haue done that thing that is pleasant to
thée, which thing who so doth, néedeth not to feare any of those
two places. Beside that the Dunce-men and Sophisters themselues,
which were (as most learned men thinke) the inuenters
and finders, yea, and the verie makers of Purgatorie, saie that
before the time of Christ, there was no sure place. So that Hezekia
is by their sentence skilled quite from that place. And
of Hell doth the sentence of the word of God quite him, which
saith, There is no damnation to them that are in Christ Iesu.

                  Shall be worthy to be punished with Hell,Mat. 5. 22 &c. ¶Whereas
we read heere, Hell, it is in the text it selfe Gehenna, which
is an Hebrue word made of two, and is as much to saie as the
Uallie of Hynnon,, which otherwise the Hebrewes called Topheth.
It was a place, where the Israelites were wont most cruellie
to sacrifice their Children to false Gods, wherevppon it
was taken for a place to torment the Reprobates. As Ieremy.

to be weake, féeble or inconstant, to be oppressed with
desires or affections of the flesh, or of the world, by the craft or
subtiltie of false prophets, to be brought awaie from it, & led into
a false beliefe, by false doctrine, whom the diuell doth vs as

his ministers, to deceiue the simple people vnlearned. Also scripture
vseth to call men helpers of the faith, when men doe diligentlie
watch that they be not deceiued by y• diuell, nor by anie
of his Ministers, when they doe labour with all force to make
their faith sure and strong, doubting of altering in no parte,
but by all meanes studieth euerie daie to make their faith more
stronger and stronger by all manner of good workes.

                  HEr,Gen 38. 7. the eldest sonne of Iuda was maried to Thamar of Mesopotamia,
the daughter of Aran. Now, Her was a wicked
impe, and doubted of Thamar because she was not of the lande
of Chanaan, therfore the Angell of the Lord slew him, the third
night after his mariage, when he had not yet companied with
hir, by reason of his mothers subtiltie, and so he died in his
naughtinesse, for she was loath that he should haue anie child by
hir. When Anan was mariageable, Thamar was giuen vnto
him, and he also of a spite companied not with hir, notwithstanding
that, he liued a full yeare with hir, and when he was threatened
of his father Iuda, then he companied with hir, but yet by
his mothers commandement, he let his séed fall vpon the ground,
and so he also died in his wickednesse.

               HERESIE.
               
                  The definition of Heresie.
                  AS touching the definition of Heresie, S. Austen saith: To
expresse by orderly definition what thing maketh and Heretike,
as I iudge, is either impossible or verie hard.
                  ¶The word Heresie, is deriued of a Uerbe, which signifieth to
elect or chuse vnto themselues, some certain opinions, which are
against the holy Scriptures, and do stubbornly defend the same.
And the causes of this their choise, for the most part, are either

because they are ignoraunt of the holy Scriptures, or els if they
knowe them, they despise them, and being driuen by some couetousnesse,
they apply themselues to the inuention of some errours,
Wherefore Augustine in his booke De vtilitate credendi
writeth, An Heretike is he, which for the loue of gaine or
rule, either bringeth vp, or els followeth new opinions. The definition
therefore of Heresie, is a choice and stubborne defending
of opinions, which are against the holy Scriptures, either
by reason of ignoraunce or els contempt of them, to the ende
the easier to obtaine their owne pleasures and commodities.
                  The choise and stubborne defending is in this definition in steed
of the forme, but the opinions disagréeing with the holy Scriptures
serue for the matter. Pride and couetousnesse make Heresie.
And the obtaining of dignities, gaine and pleasures are
appointed the endes of this so great a mischiefe. By this definition,
it is manifest inough (as I thinke) who be Heretikes.

                  What things are required for the proofe of Heresie.
                  For iust proofe of Heresie, thrée things necessarie are required
for the proofe of Heresie. First, that it be an errour. Second,
that it be an errour against the truth of Gods word. Thirdly,
that it be stoutly and willingly maintained. Otherwise, an errour
in Gods truth without wilfull maintenaunce, is not an
Heresie. S. Austen saith, Errare possum, &c. In an errour I
maie be, but an Heretike I cannot be.

                  How Heresie is to be auoyded and punished.
                  A man that is giuen to Heresie, after the first and second admonition
auoid, &c.Tit. 3. 10. After that the godlie Minister hath by the
mightie word of God, conuinced any man of heresie, if that man
will obstinately abide in his erronious opinion & doctrine, it is
lawfull for the godly Magistrate to punish him with ye sword,
this place (which doth only pertain to the Minister, vnto whom
the temporall sword is not deliuered) notwithstanding. Paule
did smite Bariesu with blindnesse. Act. 13. 11. And ye Lord Deut.

                  ¶This Commaundement is giuen to the Minister, and
so particularly to all men to whom ye sword is not committed,
but els the Magistrate whose chiefe office is to maintain Gods

glorie in his Church, ought to cut of all such rotten & infectious
members from the bodie.

               HERETIKE.
               
                  What is to be done with Heretikes.
                  MY bretheren (saith Iames) if anie of you doe straie from the
truth, so that anie man conuert him, he must know that who
soeuer doe cause a sinner to turne from the errour of his waie,
shall saue a soule from death. But now a daies you maie find
men, that will trauaile rather to ouerthrow, then to turne heretiks.
The Lord (saith Augustin) doth ouerthrow the kingdomes
of errour through his seruaunts, but he giueth charge, that the
men, forasmuch as they be men, should be rather reformed then
lost. Neither ought we to dispaire of the turning of our brother
which is fallen into Heresie. For vnlesse that such a one might
be conuerted, by the grace of the Lord, the aduise of Iames hadde
bene vtterly to no purpose. This Augustine knew well, and
therefore he emploied himselfe whollie vnto the conuerting of
Heretikes, and that with great lenitie and mildenesse of spirite,
according vnto the monition of the Apostle. Againe he saith, It
was our dutie to chuse and to wish the best, that we might make
our waie to your reformation, not in contention, wrawling and
persecution, but by comforting of you gently, by aduising you
fauourably, by reasoning mildly, as it is written: It becommeth
not the seruaunt of the Lord to striue, but to be lowly towards
all men, fauourably to teach, patient, reforming them
that be of a contrarie minde with modestie.

from vs, vnto the company & sect of most silthy folke, think that
they be able to get away some great & notable person, then they
tremble and quake excéedingly, and be much afraid least he shall
turne backe againe. He will be of their side (say they) & indéede
such a fellow will turne a thousand times, I meane not of them

sorie for it, & do waile & lament, & am striken to the very heart

owne members cut off. But yet for all that, I doe not so lament
that, that I shall be driuen vppon this feare, to doe anye

degree of counsailers and aduisers, he which giueth his aduice &
sheweth his opinion, doth not compel the hearer, but doth leaue
a free choice to his power what to doe. And he is to be blamed
onelie for this, if he saie not those things which becommeth
him, and which he is bound to doe. This saith Chrisostome.

and made Prince of Galile by his father Herode. The same
tooke his brother Philips wife from him he being yet aliue, the
which happened by this occasion: Herode went to Rome,
and by the waie, he lodged by chaunce with his brother Philip,
who dwelled in ye forepart of Iewrie. As Herod & Herodias
had now made acquaintance, which Herodias was the daughter
of Aristobolus, and sister to Herode Agrippa, they were agreed,
y• he comming from Rome, should lead hir with him, the
which was done. Iohn Baptist rebuked this wickednesse, who
was therefore beheaded. Howbeit Herod went not vnpunished
at the last for it. For by Caius Caligula was he sent in exile, at
Leonia in Galile with Herodia, the which constrained him to
goe to Rome and require a kingdome, but comming home with
out doing ought, he lost that part also of the kingdome, which
he possessed afore. He reigned 24. yeares in Galile.
                  
                  For Herode had taken Iohn and bound him,Mat. 14. 3. &c. ¶The Euangelists
affirme that Iohn was taken, because he openlie cō
                     demned
the incestious Matrimonie of Herode with Herodias,
which was his brother Philips wife: for Iohn said to him, It
is not lawfull for thée to know hir. Iosephus alledgeth another
cause why he was put in prison, namelie because by his doctrine
(to the which the people wonderfullie resorted) he brought himselfe
in some suspition with Herod, of the mouing of some new
attempt or vnwonted matter. But it might be that the wicked
Tyraunt tooke this as a cloake, to couer his cruel murthering
of Iohn. Or it might be, that this wicked rumour was spread
abroad of him, for vniust violence and crueltie, is neuer without
diuers accusations. But the Euangelist shew the verie

is deceiued, which thought that Herodias was not taken from
Philip, the brother of Herode but from Herode the king of Chalos
his fathers brother, for at what time the Euangelist writ,
the remembrance of the wicked déede, was not onelie new, but
also common in the eies of all men.
                  And whereas Iosephus in another place saith, that Philip
was of a softe wit, in consideration and hope whereof, there is

no doubt, but that Herode was the more bold to accomplish his
will, and to abuse the modestie of Philip, not fearing anie punishment.
                  Héere is also another probable coniecture that Herodias was
rather giuen in Matrimonie to Philip hir fathers brother, then
to hir great Unckle the Father of hir Graundfather, which for
age was euen crooked. But Herode Antipas héere mentioned,
and Philip, were not bretheren by the mother side, but Herode
was the sonne of Marthaca the third wife of great Herod, and
Philip was borne of Cl

                  The meaning of the Prophet in this place.
                  With the holie thou shalt be holie,Psa. 1
                           •
                        . 25. and with the perfect thou
shalt be perfect, with the cleane thou shalt be cleane, and with
the froward thou shalt be froward. ¶This text most commonlie
hath
                        •
                     bene alleadged to this end: That if a man did acquaint
himselfe and kéepe companie with good men, he shoulde learne
by their example, custome, and companie kéeping, to be a good
& a godlie man. And contrariwise, who did keep companie with
the vngodlie, with mockers and scorners, with liars and swearers,
or with anie other notablie spotted with anie kind of vice,
or euill manners, the companie kéeper with such, must néeds at
the length be infected with the same vices. And therefore Cato
gaue a precept to young children, Tu bonis ambula, My childe
kéepe companie with them that be good, for it is most true that
the Apostle saith: Corrumpant mores bonos colloquia praua:
Naughtie & filthie talke do oftentimes corrupt good manners:
To this purpose and ende therefore to teach men this holye

wholesome lesson to beware of euill companie, & to ioine them
to good companie, was this text commonlie alledged: Cum sancto
sanctus eris, &c. Which sentence as it is verie good, so it is
not true nor agréeing with y• mind of the Prophet. For his meaning
in this place is, y• God with a man y• is holie, he wil be holy,
that is, he wil be present with him & mainteine his holines. And
with him that is present & sound without wrinkles or wiles,
God will dwell with him & strengthen him in his perfectnesse,
and with the pure the Lord will be pure, and with the froward,
the Lord wil deale frowardlie, not y• there is anie frowardnesse
or peruertnesse in God: but dealeth frowardlie after the
manner of speaking of y• Scripture, when he punisheth ye frowardnesse
of men. Like as God is holie with them that be holie,
y• is, he prospereth them in their holinesse. Now ye sée y• albeit,
this as a good & godly sentence gathered of these words: Cum
sancto sanctus eris, &c. With him that is holie, vertuous, & good,
a man (kéeping companie with such) shall haue a smacke of his
holinesse & vertuousnesse: And he that shall vse to kéepe companie
with the wicked & vngodlie, shall grow to wickednes & vngodlines:
yet the more true & the verie Germaine sence of these
words in this: to applie them to the practises of God, & not companie
kéeping with man: whose propertie is to be mercifull, &
to shew his louing fauour vnto men fréelie without our deseruing,
and yet this fauour doth follow them that applie themselues
to holinesse and vertuousnesse.

Ghost was receiued.

and visible signe, as the Apostles themselues receiued
it, in the first daie, or (as we call it) Whitsondaie, which thing
at y• time was necessarie, for the furtherance & stablishment of
the preaching of the Gospell, although not néedful to saluation.
But now that the preaching thereof is sufficientlie confirmed,
this visible miracle is ended, and yet remaineth that stil which
was stablished by the miracle, y• is, by the preaching of y• Gospell
is ministred the holie Ghost, although our bodilie eye sée
it not, by whom faith commeth, which receiueth Christ to be

our righteousnesse, sanctification and redemption. 1. Cor. 1. 30.

                  Are ye not ware that ye are the Temple of God,1. Cor. 3. 16 and how
that the spirit of God dwelleth in you. If anie man defile y• temple
of God,

                        . Cor. 6. 16 him shall God destroie, for the temple of God is holy,
which Temple are ye.1. Cor. 6. 19 And againe, ye are the Temple of the
liuing God, as saith God, I wil dwel among them and be their
God, and they shall be my people. But we are also called in
Scripture, y• temples of the holie Ghost. For know ye not saith
Paule, that your bodies are the temples of ye holie Ghost, which
is in you, wherefore it must néeds be graunted that the holie
Ghost is God.
                  ¶What man knoweth the things of man,1. Cor. 1. 11 saue the spirite of
man which is within him. Euen so ye things of God knoweth no
man, but ye spirit of God: By which sentence it is euident, y• as
is the spirit of man to manward, so is the spirit of God to Godward,
& as the spirit and bodie is but one man, & yet haue seuerall
offices, euen so the Father, Sonne, & holie Ghost, although
they be distinct in name and office, are yet but one God.
                  S. Paule saith, If the spirit of him y• raised vp Christ frō death
dwel in you,Rom. 8. 11 euen he y• raised vp Christ from death, shal quicken
your mortall bodies, because of his spirit that dwelleth in
you. And againe, speaking of the same holie Ghost, he sayth:
If ther be anie man that hath not the spirit of Christ,Rom. 8. 9. the same
is none of his. For as much then as the same holie Ghost, is
indifferentlie the spirit of the Father and of the 
                        •
                     onne, it must
néedes be graunted, that he is of the selfe same nature and substaunce
with them both, and so all one God with them. This
sentence also proueth Christ to be God.
                  
                     ¶Peter sayd to Ananias, how is it that Satan hath filled
thine hart, that thou shouldst lie vnto the holy Ghost. And after
that he saith
                        •
                      Thou hast not lied vnto me, but vnto God. Wherfore
seeing he saith, in lieng vnto the holie Ghost, he lied vnto
God, it cannot be denied but that the holie Ghost is God.
                  ¶None maie be euerie where and in all persons at once but
God:Act. 2. 5. The holie Ghost maie be in all men and euerie where at
one time and moment, Ergo the holie Ghost is God.
                  
                     ¶None hath power to send forth & appoint Christ to y• preaching
of the Gospell but God,Luke. 4. 18 but the holie Ghost hath done the
same, as Christ himselfe affirmeth out of Esaie the Prophet,
saieng:Esa. 61. 1. The spirit of the Lord is vpon me, for he hath anointed
me to preach the Gospel to the poore, and hath sent me to heale
the broken in heart,1. Iohn. 5. 7 wherefore the holie Ghost is God.
                  ¶There are thrée saith Iohn that beare record in heauen,
the Father, the Word, & the holie Ghost, and these thrée are one.
And although some men affirme y• this sentence (these thrée are
one) is not found writtē in y• Gréek, yet is it altogether vntrue,
for y• Gréeke trāslation hath it. But if it were not in y• Gréeke,
what is that for vs, séeing the selfe same thing maie be proued
by other places of Scripture, for Christ sayth: I and the father
are one. And the holie Ghost also, is not onelie the spirit of the
Father, but also of the sonne, & so is of one nature and substance
with them, as is before sayde, wherefore it maie well bée sayd,
y• he is God, and y• these thrée are one, and beare record of the
truth, for he sayth, If we receiue the witnesse of man, yea, the
witnesse of God is greater. The witnesse of them, is the witnesse
of God, Ergo the Father, the Sonne, and the holie Ghost
are God.
                  ¶It is onelie the office of God to elect and choose ministers
which are fit to gouerne his Church,Act. 12. 24 and therfore the Apostles
setting Barnabas & Mathias before God, sayd thus: Thou Lord
which knowest the heartes of all men, shewe whether of these
two thou hast chosen. But y• holie Ghost also appointeth ministers
to preach,Act. 13. 2. for it is written that the holie Ghost sayde: Seperate
me Barnabas & Saule, vnto ye worke wherevnto I haue
called them. And againe sayth Paule: Take héede vnto your
selues,Act. 20. 28 and to all the flocke, amongest whome y• holy Ghost hath
made you ouerseers to rule ye congregation of God, which he
hath purchased with his bloud, wherefore it cannot be denied
but y• the holye Ghost is God. The selfe same reason vseth Athanasius
against Arrius the chiefe Author of this sect.
                  ¶None hath power to adopt vs to be the children of God,
but God onelie: but by the holie Ghost we are adopted to be
the children of God, for Paule calleth the holie Ghost, the spirit
of Adoption, and all because we are thereby made the children
of God, Ergo the holie Ghost is God.

wordes doe testifie in the booke of the Popes decrées: Aquam
sale conspersam populi benedicemus, &c. We blesse water
sprinkled with salt for y• people, that they sprinkled therwith
may be hallowed and cleansed. The which thing we command
all Sacrificers or Priests likewise to doe. For if the Ashes of
a Calfe sprinkled with bloud, hallowed and cleansed the people:
much more water sprinkled with salt, and sanctified with
good praiers, halloweth and cleanseth the people. These bée the

pointes of religion taught in them: when therefore the Lorde
shall blesse this kingdome with some excellent preachers, let
them be commaunded to make mo homilies of the principall
partes of Religion, which maie be read to the people by those

of things absent, and open shewing of hidden things.

abide for it. ¶Abraham hoped that he should receiue the

of Saule and his seruants hanging ouer his head, so that oftener
then once he was in daunger of his life. The Apostles &
holie Martyrs of Christ, did hope that they shoulde haue eternall
life, and that God would neuer forsake them, and yet neuerthelesse,
they felt the hatred of all sortes of people, they were
banished their Countries, and lastlie were slaine by sundrie
torments. So (I say) is ye hope & looking for of things not presēt
& things not séene. Yea it is a sure & most assured looking for of
things to come, & that not of things whatsoeuer, but of those
which beléeue in faith, & of those which are promised to vs, by ye
verie true, liuing, and eternall God. For S. Peter saith: Hope
perfectlie in the grace which is brought vnto you. Nowe they
hope perfectlie, which do without doubting commit themselues
wholie vnto the grace of God, and doe assuredlie looke for to inherit
life euerlasting.

                  How hope hangeth vpon faith.
                  Hope is nothing else, but a looking for those things, which
faith hath beléeued, to be trulie promised of God. So faith beléeueth
that God is true: Hope looketh for the performaunce of his
truth in cōueniēt time: Faith beléeueth y• he is our father, Hope
looketh for him to shew himselfe such a one toward vs. Faith
beléeueth that eternal life is giuen vs: Hope looketh y• it be one
daie reuealed. Faith is the foundation whervpon Hope resteth:
Hope nourisheth and susteineth Faith, &c.

thou knowe what the matter is? I do weigh and consider thrée
points, in which my whole hope doth consist. That is to wit, the
loue of adoption, the truth of the promise, and the power to performe.

Now let my foolish imagination wonder as much as it
list, & saie, what art thou? Or, how great a glorie is this? Or
by what desert dost thou hope to obtein this thing? And I wil

assured that God hath adopted me in excéeding great loue, and
that he is true in his promise, and able in performance, for he
is able to doe what he will.

Horne in the Hebrew tongue signifieth might, & it is a Metaphore
taken from beasts that fight with their hornes. And by
raising vp the might of Israel, is ment y• the kingdome of Israel
was defended, & the enimies therof laied on the ground, euen
then when the strength of Israel séemed to be vtterlie decaied.

his helth,Psal. 18. 2. bicause by him he had subdued his enimies & obteined

their hornes defend themselues, and driue awaie them that
fight against them.
T. M.

the Metaphore of the word Cornu, an Horne, for the most perfect
and pure strength: The translation béeing taken of horned
beasts, whose power & defence be altogether in their hornes.
                  The same Metaphore & the same words we haue in the Gospel
of Luke, in the song of Zacharie: Et erexit Cornu salutis nobis
in domo, &c. This Horne of saluation is an other manner
of horne, then y• horne which ye fables of ye Poet doe speake off.
They haue a pretie and pleasant fable, not altogether vnlike
to some of our pilgramage fables, which was this, That Iupiter,
which in déede was a bastard borne, being cast out of his
mother at al aduentures (as oftentimes bastards be) neuertheles
his father Saturnus caused a Goat to giue him sucke, & two

Nymphs to nurse him, the one was called Adrasia, & the other
Ida. The name of the Goat that gaue him suck, was Amalthea,
which Amalthea after y• 
                     Iupiter was a great old god, he set her
among the stars: sau

hornes to his two nursses, graunting to y• Goates horne
this propertie, That whatsoeuer they should wish for, it should
by and by spring out of that horne, of the which fable sprang a
Prouerb, Cekas Amaltheias: Hoc est Cornu Amalthea: siue cor
nu copia, plentie of al things. This was a foolish fable & a stark
lie of the Heathen Poets: but the horne of saluation which
the Scripture speaketh of, is nothing else but the almightie and
vnspeakable power of Gods defence for his true seruauntes.

they in the sight of men, and yet are they taught of God, to disclose

                  How Iacob is heere a figure of the church.
                  IN that that his youngest brother did purchase the inheritance
from the eldest,Gen. 25. 29 was a figureFigure. of the Church that shoulde bée
congregated and gathered together of the Gentiles, the which
(the Iews being excluded) encreaseth dailie more & more, receiuing

vnbeliefe, haue made themselues vnworthie.
               
               
                  What is meant by this word Iacob, and by
seeking of his face.
                  
                     Haec est generatio querentium faciem tuam Iacob.
                     Psal. 24. 6. O Iacob
this is the generation of them which séeke for thy face. ¶This
sentence seemeth to be straunge, and much disonant from the
vaine of holie Scripture, to saie, O Iacob, this is the generation
of them that seeke for thy face. For it is well knowne that Iacob
                     Iacobs face.
was a mortall man, begotten of Rebcca by Isaac his naturall
father. Wherefore to call them blessed that seeke for the face
of Iacob, albeit he was an holie man and a worthie Patriarke,
it is a readie waie to set vp inuocation and pra
                        •
                     eng to the dead
Saints, which is not a true seruing of God, but an horrible blaspheming
of God, and a plaine robbing of him of his glorie,
which he hath neuer graunted to anie creature, but hath euermore
since the beginning of the world commaunded all inuocation,
all praiers, all supplications, all hope and confidence of
helpe, either bodilie or Ghostlie, to be put whollie and onelye in
him, the onelie fountaine of life, grace, goodnesse, health, or plentie,
and whatsoeuer we haue. Therefore it séemeth to be a dangerous
sentence to saie: O Iacob, this is the generation of them
that séeke thy face. To the vtter auoiding of this inconuenience:
ye must note, y• by this word Iacob is not vnderstood y• person of
Iacob the Patriarke, which was the son of Isaac, 
                     
                        •
                      brother to Esau,
but by this word Iacob the Scripture doth customablie vnderstand

the whole family, the whole household and the congregation
of Gods people, which in their manners and liuings doe
follow the steppes of Iacob, which according to his name, was
a mightie wrastler, against all worldly wayes, and lewde lusts
of the flesh. To proue that this word Iacob, doth signifie all the
whole people of God, we haue to witnesse (beside the words of
the Prophet, in diuers places of y• Psalm, the manifest words of
the Prophet Esa. 44. 1. Audi Iacob seruus meus, & Israel quem
elegi, &c. Hearken O Iacob my seruaunt, and O Israel whom
I haue chosen, thus saith the Lord, thy fashioner and 
                        •
                     ormer, thy
helper and protector from the womb of thy mother, I wil poure
my spirit vppon thy seede, and my blessing vppon thy stocke: so
that this man shall say: I am the Lords, and another shall call
in the name of Iacob. Certaine it is that these words were spoken
many hundred yeares after Iacob the Patriarke was departed
out of this lyfe. So that the Prophet héere by the name
of Iacob and Israel (which was all one man) vnderstandeth all
the Congregation of Gods people, whome he biddeth to be of a
good chéere, and in the Lord to ioye in this lyfe, for vpon all the
seed of Iacob, that is, vpon all faithful people, that do follow the
fashiō of Iacob, in faith & purenes of life, god promiseth to poure
vpon them & their seede his holy spirit, so that this man in this
corner shall say, I am the Lords, & another man in another corner
shall call on the name of Iacob, that is, in the name of the
same God, that Iacob called on, which is the father of our Lord
Iesus Christ. This is inough to teach, that by this one word Iacob,
is vnderstood all the faithfull flocke & people of God, which
doe séeke the face of Iacob, when they doe follow the steppes of
Iacob in good liuing.

sonne,Iacobs lie &c. ¶Although Iacob was assured of this blessing by faith,
yet he did euil to séeke it by lyes, and the more he abuseth Gods
name therevnto.

he smote Iacob vnder the thigh, wherewith the sinow of Iacobs
leg shranke. Then said Iacob, I will not let goe my hold, vntill
thou blesse me. What is the name said the Angell? Iacob sayd
he: Well said the Angell, thou shalt be called Iacob no more,
but thy name shalbe Israel, that is by interpretation, a man that
séeth. And because thou hast wrastled with me, which doth represent
the person of God and hast preuailed, feare not, but thou
shalt preuaile against men. By this mystical wrastling he was
ascertained that he should ouercome his brother Esau. As euermore

there are found manie and sundry matters of these formes: so
also, are there diuers kindes of Idolls. Wherefore, whether
they be stones, wood or mettalls, by which God is outwardly

(Image). Now if the Papists wil not haue their
Images lykened vnto the Images of the Gentiles, then they
must proue their Images, not to be the workes of mens hands,
and that they can speake, see, heare, smell, feele and walke, and
that they can bring foorth a voice through their throate, or els
if they cannot, it must needes followe, that the Images of the
Idolatrous Christians, and of the Gentiles, be all one.

                     Theophilactus doth expounde and set foorth the occasion of
this place on this manner. There were some (saith he) perfect among
the Corinthians which were of opinion, that man coulde
not be defiled with any thing y• went into the body, & which did
vnderstand vndoubtedly, & knowe that Idols are made of wood
and stone, and that they can hurt no man, and therefore going indifferently
to the Temples and Altars of such Idolls, they did
gréedely eate of the things that were offered vnto Idolls.
                  When they of a weaker faith sée this, some of them went with
the rest vnto the Idolls Temple, and did eate with them of the
things that were offered vnto the Idolls: but not with a lyke
minde and opinion, as they which beléeued the Idolls to be vnworthie
to whome anie Sacrifice should be offered. This their
doing did moue Paule to be angrie: And why not? for it hurt
them both meruailously. It hurted them that wer more perfect,
because it made them pertakers of the Diuels bread. It hurted
them that wer lesse perfect, because it moued them to Idolatry.
Paule therefore goeth about to remedie this euill, and so omitting
or leauing them (as manie times hée is wont to doe) that
were of lesse perfection, he speaketh vnto them that were more
perfect, and doth most chiefely represse and beate downe that
vaine pride which they had conceiued of their humaine knowledge
and science. So much doth Theophilactus write of this
place.
                  Saint Paule doth handle the whole matter after this sorte.
First in the beginning, he doeth with a godly Exordium touch
the arrogancie of the false Apostles, teaching that any manner
of knowledge be it neuer so excellent, if it be not moderated
and ruled by charitie, is not onely vnprofitable, but also
most pernitious and hurtfull.
                  Afterward he doth reuerse the arguments and obiections of
the aduersaries, which he aunswereth by and by. This his saieng:
We knowe that an Idoll is nothing in the worlde,
doeth pertaine to the declaration of the Aduersaries Argument.
For they that gloried in their knowledge, went about
to prooue that it was lawfull for anye manne to eat
                        •
                     
                     
of those things that were offered vnto Idolls after this manner.
The Gods of the Gentiles are nothing: therefore their Images
and Sacrifices are nothing also: which argument they
proued thus. There is but one onely God, whatsoeuer is then
spoken of the Gods, are but vaine and false. The conclusion is
proued after this sort: the Idoll or Image doth represent him,
whose Image it is, but it is most euident and plaine, that the
Gods are nothing, wherevpon it must also follow, that their Idolls
are nothing, his meaning is not, that the Idolls which be
in the world be nothing at all, for they are wood and stone, but
they be of no value, force or strength. Now Paules aduersaries
taking an occasion of this, reasoned on this wise: Sith that it
is most certaine, that Idols are vaine, it is euident and plaine,
that the worshipping of them is vaine also. If it be vaine, and
the godly which confesse doe beléeue it to be vaine: the godly
may without scrupulositie of conscience, be present at the sacrifices
of the Gentils, & sit with them at their feasts & bankets,
which they do kéepe in the honor of their Idols. For the minde
being restored vnto it selfe, doe honor & worship the true lyuing
God alone, therfore it contēueth Idols, & cannot sith it is purified
by saith, be polluted or defiled with those things y• be offered
vnto thē, Unto all these, Paule maketh this answere: Although
thou doest beléeue there is but one God, & doest therfore vnderstand
that both the Idols, the worshipping of them, & the sacrices
offered vnto them are but méere vanitie, yet all men do not
so much, neither do they come to the sacrifices with ye same conscience.
He that is weake & hath not yet put away his olde inueterate
error, which he had sucked of his fore-fathers doth with
a conscience sit at such meates, & according to his olde superstition,
which he hath not full shaken off, doth feare & dread those
Gods. Specially when he séeth thée, whom he taketh to be of a
sound iudgment, to sit at such prophane meates, for he doth suspect,
that thou doest eate with none other conscience then hee
doth, and so he is not smally offended with thy bolde example.
Both Saint Ambrose, Theophilactus and also Erasmus do allowe
this exposition.
                  Now if ye will apply this to our Images, yée shall finde nothing
that doth more strongly impugne them, for although, he
which is of strong faith, knoweth the Image to bée nothing,

yet another which hath a weaker faith, will not so iudge, but as
long as he shall sée them thus to stand in Churches, he will reason
thus with himselfe: Idolatrie is not so damnable as y• preachers
doe say it is, sith that they are kept in the Church, and are
tollerable, and borne withall of some learned men. So they that
from their cradell haue bene nouseled in superstition, and haue
bene perswaded that there is some holinesse in the Images, are
kept still in errour, and canne neuer come to a perfect and pure
faith: therefore it is a most wise point to put downe all Images,
sith it is against all reason, that a thing of naught shoulde
stand in the house of God, in the place of praier, and thereby had
in reuerence.

be in Chaldea among the Idolaters. And now with one sentence
he instructeth them, both how to protest their owne religion

shame, which should exhort them to Idolatrie, and therefore he
writeth this sentence in the Chaldeans tongue, for a memoriall.

is a seruice to the inuisible God, whose seruice is
spirituall, as he is a spirit.

                  Idolaters. ¶That is to say, which preferre any thing before
the loue of God, or which presume to worship God with any
supersticious seruice, not warranted by his word. For thus

saith the Lord: Whatsoeuer I commaund you, that take you
héede vnto, that ye doe it. To this thou shalt adde nothing, from
this thou shalt take nothing. Deut. 12. 32. And Paule writeth of
Idolatrie in this wise: Who, when they knew God, glorified
him not as God, nor were thankefull, but fell to fondenesse in
their owne imaginations. Rom. 1. 21.

                     Nimroth which was the fourth from Noe, was the first inuenter
of Idolatrie. For as Orotius writeth, after that Nimroth
had bene long from Babilon, and returned thether againe,
he found it replenished with ye people of the Chaldes, who being
glad of his returne, made him their king. Then he finding falt,
because they had no God to make Sacrifice vnto, caused a flaming
fire to be made, and commaunded that whosoeuer would
not worship that fire, should be brent therein. And none disobeied
him but Abraham and his brother Aram. Which two Nimroth
threw into the fire: but God preserued Abraham.

                     Abraham and Lot departed out of Chaldea into Mesopotamia,
because they would not be stained with the wicked superstition
of the Chaldes, for whereas in the Sacrifice of the godly,
fire came downe from heauen and kindeled the Oblations,
the wicked kindeled a fire, and set vppe a new Gods seruice of
their owne inuention, which fire afterwarde was called holye
fire, & had in such estimation, that Kings caused it to be carried
before thē vpon an horse. And of this fire began the first occasion
of Idolatrie, before Images wer vsed. And this Idolatrie in
scripture, is called Vr Chaldeorum, that is, the fire of Chaldei.

                  What the head of Idolatrie is.
                  The head of all Idolatrie, is to trust in a perticular and in a
forged worshipping of God, excogitated of his owne head, and
in the meane season to doubt in tribulations, whether God wil
be fauourable. This doubt I say, is the principall parte of Idolatrie.
And the vngodly which neuerthelesse estéemeth himselfe
good and wise, doth in this point, much differ from the true
Christian and godly.

                  How Idolatrous things may be conuerted
to the honour of God.
                  When Temples, Idolls, Groues, and such lyke things by
authoritie be ouerthrowen, although it is manifest when we doe
that, we honour them not, but detest them: yet for all that,
we maye not therefore couet them or vse them to our own priuate
vses onely and commoditie, that it may appeare that we
destroie them for Religion sake, and not for couetousnesse. But
when they are conuerted, not into priuate and our owne vse,
but into common vses, or into the honour of the true God, that
is done and brought to passe in them, which is done and brought
to passe in men themselues, when of Idolaters and wicked persons,
they are changed into true Religion. This hath God him
selfe taught in those testimonies, which thou thy selfe hast vsed,
when as God himselfe commaunded, that of that same Groue,
which was dedicate to strange Gods, there should be woo
                        •
                     e taken
for his sacrifice. And of Hierico, that all the golde, & siluer,
and brasse, should be brought into the Treasurie of the Lord.
                  Wherefore, that also which is written in Deutronomy
                           •
                        
                      Thou
shalt not couet their siluer nor their gold, neither shalt thou take
any thing thereof to thy selfe, least thou offend, because it is abhomination
vnto the Lord thy God, &c. It manifestly appeareth,
that either priuate vses is forbidden in such things, or that nothing
should be brought into thy house to be honoured, for then
it is abhomination.

                     IEhouah is Gods name, neither is anye creature so called,
and it is as much to saye, as one that is of him-selfe,

in great letters (except there be any errour in the printing) it
is in Hebrue Iehouah, thou that art, or he that is.

thus: All the names of the Creator that be found in all bookes,
be deriued of effects, sauing that name onely Iehouah. And it
is a name appropriate vnto the most high Creator. And therefore
it is called an expresse name. He meaneth (saith Musculus)
that there is signified and shewed thereby, the substance of
the Creator, and that there is nothing in it common vnto God
and creatures. But the rest of his names haue some double or
mingled signification, because they come of workes like vnto
them, which be deriued in vs. Thus the Hebrewes, doe speake
of the name of God, Iehouah.

same is that Mathew and Marke do call the Abhomination
of desolation. The Hoast of the Romanes is called héere desolation,
because that by them the Citie and Temple were destroied, & the Countrie made wast. And they are also called Abhomination
both for their heathenish impietie, and also for the
putting downe of the true worshipping and Religion. By the

                  Where manye hundred thousands of men are, there are
scarcely seauen thousand which knowe God or beléeue in God,
and yet for their sakes, the whole multitude is called godlye
people. Euen so was it in Ierusalem. Albeit the greater
parte were wicked and godlesse, yet was Ierusalem called holy,
not onely in respect of a small number of the godlye, but
also because GOD had his abiding there. So when there
was not one iuste personne in Sodome, but Lot with his
two Daughters, yet coulde not the Angell destroye Sodome
                     
with fire, so long as Lot was in it. Likewise, where
foure or fiue or ten godlie persons are to be found, for their sakes
the whole citie is called holie.

                  Why the Iewes were suffered to sweare
by the name of God.
                  In the olde lawe, the Iewes in an earnest, iust or waightie
cause, were permitted to sweare in the name of GOD, but not
by all manner creatures, least they dwelling amonge the Heathen,
and accustoming their oathes should by continuaunce of
time, fall vnto the filthie worshippinge of their Idolles, forgetting
God. Sweare by his name (saith Moses) and sée that yee
walke not after strange Gods of the nations that you remaine
among. See that ye neither make mention (sayth Iosua) nor yet
sweare by the name of their Gods. Thus in the olde lawe
were they suffered to sweare in an earnest, iust and waightie

cause. But now after the rule of Christ, be the matter neuer so
true, we maye not of our owne selues nor by our own authoritie
and priuate power, sweare or promise anie manner of
thing, &c.
               
               
                  What the principall causes be that stop the
Iewes from Christianitie.
                  I reade in the persecution of Scotlande, of one George
Wisehart a Gentleman and Martyr, of a certeine storie, which
he resiteth on this wise. I once (sayth hée) chaunced to méete
with a Iew, when I was sailinge vpon the water of Rhene,
I dyd enquire of him what was the cause of his partinacye
that he dyd not beléeue that the true Messias was come,
consideringe that they had séene all the prophesies which were
spoken of him to be fulfilled. Moreouer, the prophesies taken
awaye, and the Scepter of Iuda, by manye other testimonies
of the Scripture, I vanquished him that Messias was come,
the which hée called Iesus of Nazareth. This Iewe aunswered
againe vnto mée, When Messias commeth he shall restore
all thinges, and hee shall not abrogate the lawe, which was giuen
to our fore-fathers, as ye doe. For why? wée sée the poore
almost perishe through hunger amonge you: yet you are not
moued with pitie towardes them: But amonge vs Iewes
(though wée bée poore) there is no begger founde. Secondarilie,
it is forbidden by the Lawe to faine anie kinde of Imagrie
of thinges in heauen aboue, or in the earth beneath,
or in the Sea vnder the earth, but one God onelye to honour:
but your Sanctuaryes and Churches are full of them. Thirdlye,

and saie, that it is your God.

                  The beginning of Images.
                  
                     AVgustine affirmeth, that the beginning of Images came of
the desire which men bare vnto ye dead. For wher men tooke
it vnpatiently, by death to bée berest of them whom they dearely
loued, they desired at the least to solace themselues with the
Images of them, which pretence the Diuell abused to Idolatrie.
And by this meanes the Images of the elders were kept:
and that was counted an honour vnto the dead, and brought
some solace or comfort vnto their friendes.

                  Saint Austen pronounceth, that it is vnlawfull not onely
to worship Images, but also to set vp Images to God: And
yet sayth he none other thing, but the same which many yeares
before was decréed by the Elibertine counsell, whereof this is
the. 36. Chapter: It is ordeined that no picture bée had in the
Church, that the thing which is honoured & worshipped, be not

painted on the walls. But most notable is that which is another
place Augustine alleadgeth out of Varro, and confirmeth
it with his owne assent, that which first brought in the Images
of Gods, both tooke awaye the feare of God, and brought in errour.

                     Verum cum multus etiam abusus, &c. But sith much abuse
hath also by lyttle and lyttle crept in about the worshipping
of Images, that the Images also of those haue ben brought
into the Church which haue no testimonie of the Scripture, or
of approued authours: that many carued Images beyond measure
with great sumptuousnesse and cost, were set vp so fast in
Churches, as though héerein a great part of godlynesse consisted,
the poore people of Christ béeing in the meane while neglected,
which are the liuely Images of Christ. Furthermore, y•
we beholde the Images so painted and expressed, that they séemed
to be forged, not after the forme of christen honestie, but
after the inticements of the vanitie of the world. To conclude,
that the rude people was suffered to worshippe the Images
with a certeine trust reposed in them, ye which is not altogether
frée from Idolatrie, so y• they cannot bée excused of Idolatry, y•
haue chosen to themselues anie Image to be worshipped, and
that either for the fayrenesse thereof, or the foulenesse, or the necessitie,
or the oldnesse, beléeuing y• Image to haue some vertue,
yea, or some Godhead, or diuinitie more then the rest, which errour
is to be plainly denounced.

through Ignoraunce.
Obiection.
                  The people bée not so dull headed to worship the dumbe
Image, and not rather the things that are signified and represented by them.
               
               
                  Aunswere.
                  Where as ye say that men are not so dull headed that they
will worshippe dumbe Images, the experience hath taught vs
the contrarye. For about a thousande yeares agoe, the people
did through ignoraunce of the lawe of God, and the neglygence
of Bishoppes, beginne to worshippe dumbe Images,Images broken 1000. years ago. and for a
witnesse, Serenus Bishop of Massila, did in his Citie, breake
downe the Image of Christ, and the Images of Saintes, because
he sawe them to be worshipped of the people. And that the
people did worshippe the verie Image, this is plaine: that they
hauing the Roode and the Image of the Uirgin Marie, at home
in their owne Churches, yet woulde they goe a gadding, to our
Ladie of Wylsdon, to our Ladie of Walsingam, and the holye
Roode of Boston? What was this but a manifest signe and token,
that they were wedded to the Images, & that they thought
more holinesse in the one then in the other, else woulde they
haue contented themselues with those Images that they had at
home in their owne Churches, & spared both cost and labour,
which they bestowed vppon Idolatrous Pilgrimages.
I. Veron.
                  
               
               
                  Obiection.
                  There is no man so blinde, nor so mad or foolish, for to honour
the stocke and stone that standeth afore him, but he referreth
the honour to the thing that the Image doth represent.
               
               
                  Aunswere.
                  What did Cicero
                     Cicero. with all the Senatours of Rome, dyd
they not honour that same thing that stood afore them, and yet
as you saye, they did referre it vnto the thing, that was thereby
represented. These men were wise men, and as well learned
in their time as anie was, yet for lacke of knowledge of the
truth, they honoured stockes and stones. No man can saie but
that they did Idolatrie, yea, and that because they did honour

the stockes & stones, & not all onely for honouring of the thing
that was represented. Also what did Ieroboam, when he did
set vp the golden Calues in Bethel,
                     Ieroboams calse. and sayde to the people,
Goe no more to Hierusalem, beholde thy Gods Israel. Was
not this done to the honour of God? For they were not so
mad to thinke that those Calues were Gods, but they did honour
them in the honour of God, and that was well declared in
their sacrifice, which was none other, but such as God had commaunded
in the lawe, Ergo after your rule they might lawfully
honour those calues, referring it to God. They had also a greater
coulour for them, for all the olde Fathers did alwaies offer
vnto God calues, as Abraham with many other, which oblation
was accepted of God, wherefore they might well think that
God would be honoured in the Images of Calues.

and godly meanes to stirre vp the hearts of the people to deuotion.

the maker thereof hath made it an Image, and a teacher of lies,Teacher of lies.
whereby it followeth that the Images are the bookes of lyes,
and that they came of him who is a lyar from the beginning,
as the Father of lyes. Howe well then are the simple and ignoraunt
people, for whome our Sauiour Christ did vouchsafe to
shed his déere heart bloud, prouided for, when such bookes are
deliuered vnto them, in stéede of the liuing preaching of Gods
worde. It is not for naught that Ieremy doth crye out: They
altogether doate and are foolish,Doctrine of vanitie for the stocke is a doctrine
of vanitie. Meaning that nothing more displeaseth GOD,
nor bringeth men into greater errour and ignoraunce of God,
then Images doe, wherefore he calleth them the doctrine of

the wicked opinion of them, ye calleth them the bookes of the laye
people on this manner, Wo vnto him that saith vnto the wood,
awake, & to the dombe stone, arise vp: should the same teach?

Should, the same be laied ouer with gold & siluer, & there is no
breth in it, but ye Lord is in his holy temple. As if he shuld say:
there is no breath, no lyfe, nor mouing in the Image, how shuld
they teach then. Therefore it is more vanitie & fondnesse to set
forth Images vnto the people for their teachers & schoolemaisters,
sith y• the liuing God who is the true teacher, is in ye middest
of the temple, that is in the hharts of ye faithfull, teaching
those things, that are both profitable the euerlasting: whervnto
may be added the saieng of Saint Paule: What agréement hath
the temple of GOD with Images, but ye are the Temple
of the liuing God who liueth and worketh in you. More credit
ought to be giuen to the testimonies of the Scriptures, as of

of God through the vse of Images be made temptation to the
soules of men, and a trappe to the féete of the vnwise, for as

Also in the xv. chapter it is sayd, that they lead into errour, and
that their worke is without fruit, and that by their sight alone,
they stirre a desire in the foolish.

that therefore wée must haue Images of God, and of Christ

made after the Image of God, or disobeyeth a magistrate, which

                  Saint Austen is against the Image of
the Trinitie.
                  Man was made after the similitude and likenesse of God:
howe? Not in bodye, but in soule and minde in the inwarde
man. Wherefore Saint Austen, a man most expert in Gods
worde, crieth out against the Image of the Trinitie, callinge
it, Sacrilegium,
                     Image of Trinitie. a staining of Gods honour, and an Idoll, because
the glorye of the immortall God is chaunged into the
similitude and Image of mortall man, forbidding such an Image,
not onelye in the Church but also in thought and mind.
When Philip desired Christ to shew him the Father, hée rebuked
him, and aunswered, Hée that séeth mee séeth the Father.
                  It is sinne to set foorth to the inuisible and vnfashionable
God an Image of an olde man with an hore head. For it
is forbidden that no Image bée made for God. Deut. 4. 12. You
sawe no likenesse in that daye when the Lorde God spake to
you in Hebrewe. And Esias. 40. 18. sayth: To whome therefore
shall wée make God like? Or what Image shall we set to him.

                  The Hill Sion was walled about,Eze. 8. 3. and that Wall which
compassed it, was called the outwarde Wall. About the
Temple was there another wall, that was called the inward
wall, which although it were outward from the Temple, yet
was it inward from the wall, which compassed the Hill. The
space betwéene the inward wal, and the Temple, was called the
Inner Court. Therein were many Ports, and in the North
Port thereof was Ezechiel set: for that place was holy, and
therein did they vse to worship God. But with the filthinesse of
this hatefull Image of Baal (which the Prophet héere calleth, the
Image of prouocation, because it prouoked the Lord to vengeaunce)
had they defiled it: as superstition doth commonly defile,
euen the most holiest things, and such as appeare most godliest.

                  The Carpenter (or Image caruer) &c.Esa. 44. 13 ¶Let the Christen

héere note, how liuely the Prophet painteth out the vanitie of
Images. For it is to be feared that our superstition concerning
such things, passeth and excéedeth the superstition of the Iews.
Once euident it is, that the Iewes in our time can in no wise
be perswaded to become Christian, so long as we fall downe and
knéele before Images.Image caruer. Their aunswere is, that they and we
both (if we be of God) should in no condition doe any thing, that
openly & in so many places, be forbidden of God. The Turkes
and Saracens also mocke vs therefore: The honour of God
say they (and truth it is) ought we to séeke, and to sticke by his
word, and neither to adde thereto, neither take away, neither to
swarue to the right hand or to the left, but earnestly to stand by
that which is commaunded, & forsake that which is forbidden.
God graunt vs Christians a better trade and conuersation of
liuing, then that we shuld with our example, be an offence either
to Iewe or Saracen, & an occasion to kéepe them from the faith
of Christ, and giue the simple, eyes to sée and perceiue, the falsehoode
of the suhtill, which for lucre augment their blindnesse, &
exhort them to such superstition. So be it.

one of Apollo in the Capitol at Rome, was 30. Cubites high.
Also at Tarentum, one made by Lysippus, was 40. Cubites
high, but at Rhodes one of the Sunne excéeding all other, was
in height 70. Cubites, made by Colassis, Scholar to Lysippus.

in making twelue yeares, and the charges drew to 300. Talents,
which amounteth to 43115. pounds. Strabo writeth that

foure times in the yeare, which, why they are so deuided,
scarcely can any man perceiue. They recite Hierome vppon
Zachary, who maketh mention of the fourth moneth, fifte, seauenth

and tenth. And they seeme to be moued with a wicked
zeale to distribute these Feastes into foure partes of the yeare.
And these Feastes which the Iewes receiued euery yeare for
the calamities which they had suffered, the same our men haue
made yearely. But other haue inuented another cause, namely,
because in these foure times of the yeare, Bishops are wont to
promote Clearkes vnto the ministerie and orders. Wherefore
they say that the people ought then most of all to fast and pray,
that God would gaunt them good Pastors, &c.

without ending, all creatures haue a beginning, of the which
some neuerthelesse are called immortall because they haue no
ending, as the Angells, mans Soule? But onely God is properly
immortall, who speaketh of himselfe, I am which is, which
was, which is to come: This belongeth to God and to none of
his Creatures, and to none of the workes of his fingers: of

are our soules? Euen the very Angells of Heauen, should also
be mortall: howbeit, forasmuch as GOD hath breathed his
owne spirite into them, they must néedes continue in him.
                  It is hée from whence proceedeth immortalitie, (I saye)
euen of the Angells. And it behooueth vs also on our

                     iking
of our aduersities when we be weary of them: but it
is an excessiue hart-burning against them, when we cannot submit
our selues simply vnto God, to dispose of vs at his pleasure.
Wherefore if our passions be so vnrulely, as we cannot kéepe
any measure in our aduersities, then doth inpatiencie ouer master
vs, and if we haue no holde nor stay of our selues, we must
néedes conclude, that we are no better then frantike folke
against God, yea, and vtterly out of our wits, &c.
Pet. Mar. vpon Iudic. fol. 314.
                  
                  According to the nature of contraries, looke what good things
be attributed to Patience, the contrarie thereof may aright be
ascribed vnto Impatiencie. Patience is a vertue whereby all aduersities
be borne for godlinesse and honestie sake. Therefore
Impatiencie is the vice, wherby there is no aduersitie suffered,
for godlinesse and honestie sake.

               AS it is impossible for a Camell (or Cable, that is a great
rope of a ship) remaining in the own quantitie,Math. 19. 24. to go through
a néedles eye (remaining in his owne straightnesse) so is it like
impossible for a rich man, remaining in his own naturall pride,
couetousnes and corruption, to enter into the kingdome of God.
And therefore when those which heard were offended, as king,
And who may then enter into saluation? Christ aunswered:
Things that are impossible before men, are possible with God.
Marke wel, that Christ calleth the humiliation of the rich man,
impossible to man, but possible with God.

the Prophet conclude, that no more could the Citizens of Ierusalem,
being exercised in al iniquitie, leaue the same, and so was
it impossible. Impossible I say to themselues, and to their own

of sinners, ought not to be attributed to mans power.
Knox.
               
               For it is impossible,Heb. 6. 4 that they which were once lightened,
&c. This is Paules meaning: They that doe beléeue truely
and vnfainedly, doe continue or abide stedfast in the knowen
truth. If any therefore fall away from Christ, it is a plaine token
that they were dissembling hypocrites, and that they neuer
beléeued truly, as Iudas, Symon Magus, Demas, Hymeneus and
Philetus were, which all fell away from the knowen veritie, &
made a mocke of Christ, which Paule doth call heere, to crucifie
Christ a newe, because that they turning to their olde vomite
againe, do most blasphemously tread the benefite of Christs passion
vnder their féete. They that are such, can in no wise be
renued by repentaunce, for they are not of the number of the
Elect, as S. Iohn doth say: They went from vs, but they were
not of vs, for if they had bene of vs, they would haue remained
with vs vnto the ende. If such men doe repent, their repe
                     •
                  tance
is as Iudas and Cains repentaunce was.
               ¶This text denieth no possiblitie of mercie in God, but the
impossibilitie of repentaunce in such men as malitiously forsake
the trueh, blaspheame Christ, and take parte against the Holy
Ghost. For the truth is, that with the Lord there is mercie &
plenteous redemption. Psal. 130. 7. So that whosoeuer calleth
vpon his name shall be saued Ioel. 2. 32. and Rom. 10. 13. Now
they that forsake the truth, blaspheming Christ, and taking part
against the Holy Ghost, cannot repent. For if sinners woulde
conuert and call vpon God, they should be sure of remission.

                  What Incest is.
                  THey call Incest an vnlawfull medling of a man with a woman,
against ye honor of bloud & affinitie. For Cestus signifieth
the mariage girdle which ye Bride did weare, to shew that
the mariage was iust & lawful. We Germanes (saith Bullinger)
call this sin by y• name of Bloutschand, wherby
we signifie y• sin
committed in corrupting or defiling our owne bloud or kinred.
In Leuiticus, after the degrées and bloud in which we are forbidden
to marrie, the Lord doth presently adde: In all these
be ye not defiled: for in all these things are the Nations defiled
which I cast out before you. And héereby the lande is defiled, &
I haue visited the iniquitie thereof vpon it, and the lande hath
spued out the inhabitaunts thereof. Ye shall therefore keepe my
statutes and mine ordinaunces, and shall not doe anye of all
these abhominations. For whosoeuer shal doe so, he shall be cut
off from among his people. And in the 20. Chapter of Leuiticus,
he hath appointed death to be the punishment of Incest,
which is not changed in the Ciuill lawes or Imperiall constitutions.

                  AS touching Infants, the institution of Christ, doeth seclude
them from the Supper, because they cannot yet, proue & examine
themselues, neither yet celebrate the remembraunce of
Christs death: the which thing the Apostle Paule teacheth to be
necessary for all those, which come to the Communion of the
Supper.

is it, which maketh thine heart abound in euill, and
if by any meanes it can get roome to lodge within thée, thy hart

is taken, and imagineth from hence-foorth all mischiefe. When
our Sauiour Christ so many times reprooueth sundry sortes of
men, he maketh this a generall fault of all; that they are vnfaithfull
and flow to beleeue. When Saint Paule condemneth
them as reprobate men, which doe neuer sée the light of the
Gospell: he maketh this the cause of their sinne, that the God
of this world, hath blinded the eyes of their vnbeléeuing harts,

Harpe and Lute, we read oftentimes in the Scriptures:
and specially in the booke of Psalmes, which instruments
vndoubtedly were vsed in the Temple at Ierusalem in the seruice
of God, and namely at their singing of Psalmes. For the
Leuites did not sing their Psalmes onely with the voice of men
and children as we doe, but they ioyned with mens voices, the
swéete harmonie of musicall instruments, and namely of the
Harpe, Lute, Cymbales, and Psalteries, of ten strings. These
instruments as Iosephus writeth. li. 8. Chap. 3. Salomon ordeined
quadraginta milia. fortie thousand which were made Ex. electro. 1.
of mixture of golde and siluer. For Electrum is golde, whereof
the fift part is siluer mingled among the golde: such a mixture
is called Electrum: And of that mettal were those instruments
which Salomon did ordeine to be vsed in the Temple: and were
made of fine wood, as our Harpes and Lutes be, &c.

               INTENT.
               
                  What the word signifieth, and how it
is defined
                  INtent, signifieth a motion of the minde, whereby, by some
meane, we tend to an ende. As if a man should studye by
giuing of giftes or by seruices to attaine vnto anye honour, for
the nature of things is of such sort, that many thinges are so
anexed togethers betwéene themselues, that by the one is made
a steppe to the other. For by medicines and drinks we atteine
to health: By studies, readings, and teachers, vnto wisedome:
wherefore an intent is an action of the will, for it is his office
to moue and stirre vp the minde. And forsomuch as the
will doth not perceiue the things that he desireth, before that it
hath the knowledge thereof, it moueth not nor forceth the minde
before knowledge, which raigneth in the power of intelligence
or vnderstanding, it perceiueth both the ende, and those thinges
which serue to the ende, and ministreth them vnto the will.
                  Therefore intent stirreth vp to the ende, as to atteine by those
things which vnto it are directed. Let this be his definition. A
will tending vnto the ende by some meanes, Will, which is his
general word, is an act of the power that willeth. The difference
is taken of the obiect, namely of the end, and these things which
are ordeined vnto it: as now, as touching Gedeon, his intent
was 
                        〈…〉
                      of his will, to keepe the memorie of the victorye

                        •
                      In wil therefore he comprehended
at once both the ende and the meane, &c.

                  SAint Cyprian in his exposition of the Apostles Créed, saith:
He said not in y• holy Church, nor in the remission of sins,
nor in the resurrection of the body. For if he had added the preposition

                     In, then had the force of those clauses ben all one with
the force of that, that went before. For in those words wherein
our Beliefe touching the Godhead is set downe, in God the
Father, in Iesus Christ his Sonne, and in the Holy Ghost: but
in the rest where the speach is not of the Godhead, but touching
the creatures or mysteries, the preposition is not added, that we
may say, in the holy Church, but that the holy Church is to bée
beléeued, not as we beléeue in God, but as a Congregation gathered
to God, and that the forgiuenesse of sinnes is to be beleeued,
not that we ought to beleeue in the forgiuenenesse of sinnes:
and that the resurrection of the flesh is to beléeued, not that we
ought to beléeue in the resurrection of the flesh. So that by this
Sillable In, the Creator is discerned from the Creatures, and
that that is Gods, from that that is mans.

alleadged also his wordes in his Epistle Ad Neciphyros,
touching consecration Distinct. 4. cap. 1. We said not that ye
had to beléeue in the Church as in God, but vnderstand how
we said, that ye being conuersant in the holy Catholike Church,
should beléeue in God.

we doe not beléeue in the Church as the Authour of
saluation. Hée that beleeueth in the Church, beléeueth in
man. Leaue off therefore this blasphemous perswasion, to
thinke that thou hast to beléeue in anye worldlye creature:
since thou maist not beléeue neither in Angell nor Archangell.

vpon him, that call vpon him truly, and with that he sheweth,
who calleth vpon him truly, saieng thus: He shall doe the will
or desire of them that reuerence him, and shall heare graciously
their praier, and make them safe, for the Lord loueth all that loueth

Christ Iesus, the which hath giuen himselfe the redemption of

betwéene God and man. Where there is but one, there cannot
Saints come in. Saints be men, and must haue a Mediatour
for themselues, and then they cannot be Mediatours for other
men. Moreouer the Mediator betwéene God and man, is called
Christ Iesus, now is there no Saint that hath that name, if
there be none, then is there none that vsurpe this office without
blaspheming of Christ. Furthermore, he hath redéemed vs without
the helpe of Saints, & why shal he not be whole Mediator
without Saints, redemption is the chiefe act of a Mediatour.

desires, that cannot be expressed with tongue. ¶If the spirite
of God make intercession for vs, then haue we no néede of other
Mediatours, for he is able to obtaine all things for vs, and hath
taken this office on him for vs It were a great rebuke to him,
that Saints should be set in his steede, and ioyned with him in
his office, as though he were vnsufficient.

Doth not he aske things necessary for vs? And as Scripture
saith, He is our wisedome, he is our iustice, he is our sanctification
and our redemption made of God. Now, what resteth for

Then addeth he, But by me: héere be all Saints and merites

whatsoeuer he be, that maketh any other Mediatour, or goeth about
by any meanes (seeme it neuer so holy) but by Christ onely
to come to the Father of Heauen: First, he dispiseth Christ,

                  Héere is nothing excluded, but all things be giuen vs fréely, and
that for his names sake, not for no Saints name, nor for none
of our merites. Therefore, let vs not run from the swéete promises
of our most louing Sauiour, Redeemer, and onely Mediatour
Iesus Christ to Saints, for that is an euident token of
our infidelitie, and that we thinke him vntrue, and will not fulfill
his promise, and make him a lyar.

                     Saint Paule saith:Rom. 8. 33. He (meaning the Father of heauen) hath
giuen his onely sonne for vs, how canne it be, that he shall not
giue all things with him. ¶Marke he saith all things. He y• saith
all things, excludeth not the tooth-ake.
D. B.
                  
                  All good things commeth from the father of light. ¶Héere they
make a distinction,Iames. 1. 17 that God is good onely for his owne nature,
and Saints are good by receiuing goodnesse of him.
               
               
                  Aunswere.
                  Saints haue no more goodnesse then they haue receiued, and
that that they receiued was for themselues onelye, and canne
giue none of it to other, for they receiued it for themselues, and
no more then was necessarie, and that but onely of mercye, as
it is open in Mathewe in the Parable of the fiue wise virgins,
and the fiue foolish. Thus we doe openly against God, when
we desire anie thing of Saints, séeing the Scripture knoweth
all good things to come of God onely, and that he is the onelye
giuer of them. All the Prophets and Fathers in all their tribulations,
cried vnto him, as Dauid testifieth of himselfe saieng:
When I am in trouble I will crye vnto the Lord, and hée will
helpe me. Psal. 120. 1. My helpe is of God that made heauen and
earth. Psal.. 121. 2. Christ also himselfe teaching all creatures to
pray, biddeth vs not to go to any other, but onely to the father
of heauen. Math. 6. 9.

                  Obiection.
                  The Saints must pray for vs, and be mediatours to God for
vs, that by them we may be able to receiue our petition. This
is Richards opinion De media villa.
                  
               
               
                  Aunswere.
                  This is a great blasphemie to Christs bloud, for if Saintes
be necessarie to be mediatours for vs, then is Christ vnsufficient:
For Philosophers did neuer put two causes when one
was sufficient. And if anie thing be giuen vs for Saintes sake,
then be not all things giuen vs for Christes sake. The which
is plainly against Saint Paules saieng. Rom. 8. 32. God for vs
all hath giuen his sonne, and shall he not giue vs all things with
him.

                  An other of his reasons.
                  If Saints when they were heere, and not confirmed in grace,

did of their Charitie praye for vs, Ergo now must they praye
much more, séeing they are now confirmed in Charitie.
               
               
                  Aunswere.
                  A reason without Scripture must haue a like aunswere.
The Saints when they were héere, did of their Charitie cloath
naked men, and féede the hungrie, and gaue drinke to the thirstie,
and visited them that wer in prison, Ergo much more now,
for they be confirmed in Charitie. Likewise Saint Paule when
he was héere, did of his charitie write Epistles, and declare the
veritie, Ergo now must he much more write, so that where afore
he wrote but one, now must he at the least write thrée,
or els he is not confirmed in Charitie.

                  Another like reason.
                  Lyke as a man cannot come to the speach of a King, but that
he must haue certaine Mediators, as Dukes, Earles and such
men as be in fauour, betwéene him and the King, that may intreate
his matter.
               
               
                  Aunswere.
                  Saint Ambrose aunswereth this reason thus: Men are
wont (saith he) to vse this miserable excusation, that by these
things we maye come to God, as we maye come to Kings by
Earles. I aunswere, We come vnto the King by the meanes
of Dukes & Earles, because that the King is a man, and knoweth
not to whome he may commit the Common weale: But to
God (from whom nothing can be hid, he knoweth all mens
merites) we néede no spokes-men, nor no Mediator, but only

                  SOme interprete this name of Iob, to signifie wéeping or
wailing. And other some take it for an vtter Enemie, not

Cal. vpon Iob. fol. 2.
                  
                  It is not knowen nor can be gessed, in what time Iob liued,
sauing that it may be perceiued he was of great antiquitie.
                  Some of the Iewes haue bene of opinion that Moses was the

Authour of his booke. But forsomuch as there is no certaintie
thereof, it is left in suspense. Yet it may be well perceiued by
the Prophet Ezechiel, that the name of Iob was renowmed among
the people of Israel. For in his 14. chapter. verse. 20. hee
saith: That if Noe, Iob and Daniel, were among the people
that should perish, they should saue no mo mens liues but their
owne, and all the rest of the people shoulde bée destroied. Also
Saint Iames reporteth, that he was of great patience. So
that by these two (Ezechiel and Saint Iames) it is plainelye
shewed, that there was a Iob indéede.

                  Wherefore Iob curseth the day of his
Natiuitie.
                  Let the daye perish wherein I was borne.Iob 3. 2. ¶He curseth
not his daye because he was weary of it, as one desperate,
but rather wishing to be dissolued, least by farther troubles, he
should be forced to offend God.
The Bible note.
                  
                  ¶Men ought not to be weary of their life, and curse it, because
of the infirmities, that it is subiect vnto, but because they

                  And cursed his daye.Iob. 3. 1. ¶Héere Iob beginneth to feele his
great imperfection in this battell betwéene the spirite and the
flesh. Rom. 7. 18. And after a manner yéeldeth, but in the ende
he getteth victorie, though he was in the meane time greatly
wounded.
Geneua.
                  
                  ¶Lyke as a man hauing an Impostume (saith Chrisostome)
if he be cut of the Surgeon, hauing nothing wherewith
he may resist, during the time of his curing, holdeth fast the
things that be nigh him, and is readie to bite them that stand
by him, and yet can doe nothing vnto them: euen so Iob fearing
the grieuousnesse of blaspheming and cursing, doeth wrong
to vnliuely things, and speaking after the manner of the common
people, which impute their miseries to the influence of
the starres, and to the daye of their birth, curseth his daye, that
is, testi

                     eth with cursing, how bitter a lyfe he liueth, and vnto
how great miseries he was borne (as we commonly saye)
in an vnhappy houre, euen as though now a daies a man repenting
his sinnes should saye: Woe is mée wretch, in an vnhappie

houre was I borne, which with my déedes haue denied
my maker, woe woorth it, &c.
               
               
                  How God suffered Satan to smite Iob
with sores.
                  And smote Iob with sore Byles,Iob. 2. 7. &c. ¶This sore was
most vehement, where-with also God plagued the Aegyptians.
Exodus. 9. 9. And threateneth to punish the rebellious people.
Deuteronomy. 28. 27. So that this temptation was most
grieuous. For if Iob had measured Gods fauour by the vehemencie
of his disease, he might haue thought that God had cast
him off.

                      mine owne mouth shall condemne
me. ¶Héere it is good to sée that Iob presumeth
not of his owne righteousnesse, but plainely confesseth himselfe
vnrighteous, and a sinner before God, although before the
world he had lyued blamelesse. GOD looketh on the heart,
though men looke onely on the outwarde appearaunce.
                  His aduersaries thought, that he should neuer haue had such
a Crosse layed on him vnlesse then he had also outwardly and
openly lyued in wickednesse. To that aunswereth Iob in diuers
places, that he therein was not culpable, and therefore
accuseth as it were after the manner of men the iudgement of
God, concerning such as are outwardly righteous and stud

to lyue vertuously, namely, such as lyue without blame
among men, and that both intend and doe well to all men,
and yet are wrapped in manye miseryes and wretchednesse
often-times ouer cruell. And héerein lyeth the chiefe of the
controuersie betwixt Iob and his aduersaries, that Iob defendeth
himselfe, not to haue deserued his punishment by
his outwarde lyuing: whereas his aduersaries armed onely
with manly and fleshly wit, thinke God to be vnrighteous, if
he would so grieuously punish him, that had not bene an outward
sinner against him. Iob, his conscience bearing him witnesse
had liued innocently, and straightly, and hurt no man, had
alwayes feared GOD, and worshipped him onely, his children,
had he also nourtured to the feare of God, and coulde of

no man be accused of wickednesse, yet witnesseth he héere (as all
the godly doe) that he was not vtterly without sinne, for otherwise
had he bene a lyar. 1. Iohn. 1. 8. If we say we haue no sinne,
we deceiue our selues, & the truth is not in vs. Wherfore in the
place where he saith, that he hath not deserued his punishment,
and that should séeme to shew him blamelesse, knowe, that hée
speaketh of his outward manner of liuing, not of the inward
thoughts and desires of the heart, where he was vndoubtedly
an offender.

expoundeth it: Hide not my bloud so, but that it may bée
auenged, let not the auengement thereof be vnknowen, but
open vnto all mens eyes, as was the auengement of Dathan
and Abiram, whom the earth swallowed. Nu. 16. 32.

               IOHN BAPTIST.
               
                  Of the buriall of Iohn Baptist.
                  ANd his Disciples came and tooke vp his bodie and buried
it. ¶How it was lawfull for the Disciples of Iohn to
take away his bodie which was slaine, it may well be demaunded,
because that Iosephus saith, that he was beheaded in the
Castle of Macheron. Aunswere. Some doe aunswere that
the Disciples had accesse or lybertie to come to the Castle, as
appeareth in the 11. Chapter before, when Iohn as yet laye
bound in prison: whereby it may be gathered that they were
not prohibited. But forasmuch as this did pertaine to the crueltie
of ye woman, y• the bodie of the holy man should lye vnburied,
it is probable forsomuch as ye Disciples tooke vpon them to
burie it, that it was cast out by souldiers of the Tyrant. And although
ye honor or pompe of buriall profiteth nothing those that
are dead, yet notwithstanding it is the Lords will to haue the
same reuerenced of vs. And truly it were farre from humanitie
to suffer the dead to lye vnburied like the ca
                        •
                     kases of brute
beasts, for what sight can be more sorrowfull, vglye, or horrible,
then to sée a dead a mans body vnburied.
                  
                     Furthermore, buriall is a figure of the resurrection to come.
Wherefore this diligence of the Disciples of Iohn in comming
to burie the bodie of their maister was acceptable vnto God.
Moreouer this seemeth much to confirme their godly mindes &
earnest loue, which they bare to their maister when he was aliue,
for by this meanes they professed that the doctrine of this
holy man Iohn, remained yet in their hoa
                        •
                     tes. This confession
therefore was laudable and deserued no small commondation,
seeing it was done with daunger and great aduenture of perill:
because they could do no honour to their maister béeing put to
death, without prouoking great displeasure and outragious reuenge
of the tyrant against them. Héere we are taught what we
owe to the dead bodies of Saints, namely buriall, not papistical
canoni

                  He is risen from death,Mat. 14. 2. and therefore are miracles wrought
by him. ¶It is an Heathenish beliefe, to thinke that men can do
greater things after their death, then in their life time, and
héereof did spring the vaine worshipping of dead folkes.

                     Iohn Baptist was called Helias,
                     Mat. 17. 12 because he came in the spirit
and power of Helias, most sharply rebuking sin. That so, men
knowing their owne sinfull nature, and the damnation y• hung
ouer them, should the more gladly embrace Christ, the sauiour &
redéemer of the world.

                     Iohn did no miracles. ¶God would haue no miracles done
by Iohn,
                     Iohn. 10. 41 least the people should haue attributed too much vnto
him. And therefore he would haue him onely to teach & to testifie.
For as the bodie of Moses & his sepulchre are hid vnto this
present day, and that by the iust prouidence of God, least that superstitious
flesh in visiting the body of Moses should commit Idolatrie:
euen so for iust cause Iohn, than whome other wise

there arose not a greater among womens children, wrought no
miracles. For if so be the gift of miracles had bene ioyned to
his doctrine and holinesse of lyfe, the people could scarce haue
ben driuen srom beléeuing him to be Christ, &c.

of Iohn is taken for that heauenlye doctrine which he
taught. For as water doth wash awaye the filthinesse of the
bodie, so doth true doctrine make the soule cleane, deliuering
it from superstition and erronious doctrine.

                  Unto what then were ye baptised,Act. 19. 3. and they said vnto Iohns
Baptime. ¶By this place, Iohns Baptime signifieth Iohns doctrine,
which therefore is so called, for that he sealed his doctrine
with the seale of Baptime, in them that beléeued.
The Bible note.
                  
                  Meaning what doctrine, they did professe by their Baptime:
for to be baptised in Iohns Baptime, signifieth, to professe the
doctrine which he taught, and sealed with the signe of Baptime,
to bée baptised in the name of the Father, &c. is to be dedicate
and consecrate vnto him. To be baptised in the death of
Christ, or for the dead, or into one bodye, vnto remission of sins
is, that sinne by Christes death may be abolished and die in vs,
and that we maye growe in Christ. Math. 3. 11. Mar. 1. 8.

                  Baptime in this place is taken for the doctrine, and not
for the lauer of water. For the baptime of Christ and the baptime
of Iohn, which is done in the water, is all one: els Christ
who was baptised by Iohn, ought to haue bene baptised againe.
Héere then we doe gather that these folkes not twice
baptised with the water of Baptime, but were twice instruccted,
and at length after perfect instruction, they were baptised
with water in the name of Christ.

                  The difference betwéene the Baptime of Iohn and the Apostles
was onelye this, that Iohn baptised them to beléeue in

Christ that was for to come, and the Apostles baptised them to
beléeue in Christ, which was come alreadie, and had suffered
for the remission of sinnes of as manie as beléeued in him.

                  Of this Iohns life, written by Saint Hierome.
                  IOhn the Apostle whome Iesus loued right well, béeing
the sonne of Zebedeus, and Iames the Apostles brother,
whome after the Lordes death Herode had beheaded, wrote his
Gospell last of all the rest, being desired there to by the Bishops
of Asia, both against Cerinthus, and diuerse other heretiks. But
principally against the Ebeonites, which euen then arose, which
Ebeonites auouch that Christ was not before Marie
                           •
                        
                      by reason
whereof he was enforced to shew of his diuine natiuitie. They
say, that beside this, there was an other cause of his writing, because
that when he had read the volumes of Mathew, Marke, &
Luke, he well allowed the text of the storie, and affirmed that
they had said truth, but had onely made their storie of one yeares
act, in the which after the imprisonment of Iohn Christ suffered.
Wherefore omitting that yeares actes, which were sufficientlye
entreated of all thrée, he sheweth such thinges as were done
before Iohn was imprisoned, which thing maye euidently appeare
to such as shall diligentlye read the volumes of the foure
Gospels: the which thing also doth take awaie the disagreeing
that séemeth to be betweene Iohn & the rest. He wrote beside the
premises one Epistle, which beginneth thus: That which was
from the beginning, which we haue heard, which we haue seene
with our eyes, &c. The other two which beginne: The elder to
the well beloued Ladie and her children, &c. And the elder to the
best deloued Caius, whom I loue in the truth. &c. are affirmed
to haue bene written of Iohn the Priest, whose seuerall tombe
is at this day to be seene at Ephesus, & many suppose that there
are two memorials of this same Iohn the Euangelist, of which
matter we wil entreate, after we shal by order come to y• lyfe of

time of the Emperour Traiane, he instituted and gouerned all
the Churches of Asia, and ther continued till he was impotent
for age. He died the thréescore and eight yeare after the passion
of the Lord Iesus. And was buried a little beside the same Citie.

                     ring néere vnto him: And comming to a certeine place,
he sawe a goodly young man both of bodie and countenaunce,
on whom he east such a fauour
                        •
                      that he committed him to the
Bishoppe there, charging the Bishoppe most earnestly (and that
two seuerall times,) to sée him diligently instructed in the doctrine
and faith of Christ. And so Iohn returning againe to Ephesus,
the Bishop toke the young man and brought him home,
and diligently instructed him in the waies of Christ, and at the
last baptised him, and sawe such towardnes in the man, that hée
committed vnto him the ouersight of a certeine cure in the
Lords behalfe. The young man being now at libertie, it chaū
                     ced
certeine of his old companions and familiars to resort vnto
his companie, who being idle, dissolute, and wicked persons,
enticed him to all mischiefe, insomuch that at the last he became
as head and captaine among them in committing all kinde of
murther and felonie. In the meane time it chaunced Iohn to
come into that quarters, & méeting the Bishop, required of him
the pledge that he left with him. The Bishop was now so amazed
that he could not tell what to aunswere: Then Iohn
perceiuing his doubting, said: It is the young man & the soule
of our brother committed to your custodie which I require:
Then y• Bishop with great sorow & wéeping, said he was dead.
By what death quoth Iohn

                      He is dead to God, quoth the Bishop,
for he is how become an euill man, & the head Captaine of
theeues, which doth frequent this mountaine. When Iohn the
Apostle heard this, he rent his clothes for sorrow, and rode in al
hast toward the place where the young man lay, and by ye way
was taken with théeues. Then sayde Iohn to the théeues, for

this cause came I hether, therfore bring me to your Captaine:
And being brought vnto him: the young man béeing all armed,
began at the first to looke féercely vpon Iohn: but comming to
the knowledge of him, he was striken with great confusion and
shame, and began to flée, but Iohn following, sayd: My sonne,
why doest thou flée from thy Father? An armed man from one
naked, a young man from an olde man, haue pitie vpon me my
sonne, for there is yet hope of saluation, I will answere for thee
vnto Christ, I will die for thée if néede be, as Christ hath dyed
for vs. I will giue my life for thée. Beleeue me, Christ hath sent
me. The young man hearing, stoode still, & cast downe his weapon,
& sorrowed out of measure for his offence. And Iohn comforting
him in Christ, and in the sweete promises of saluation
for his sake, neuer left him vntill he had restored him vnto the
congregation againe, and made him a great example and triall
of regeneration, and a token of the visible resurrection.

                     Numenius an Heathen Philosopher, when he had read the
beginning of Iohns Gospell, burst out into these words, I pray
God I die, and if this barbarous followe, haue not comprehended
in few words, all that our Plato prosequuteth in so manye
words. He calleth him barbarous, because he was an Hebrew,
and in his writing leaueth traces of his mothers tongue, and
followeth not curiously the finenesse & properties of the Gréeke
manner of speaking, but he graunted vnto him as much knowledge
as the most famous Philosopher, and father of all learned
wits Plato had, and more shortnesse in writing, which is more
commendable in a writer of graue matters. Writers of histories
shew many wonderfull things of this Iohn, as that he was
put in boiling oyle, and came out againe vnhurt, &c. But it shal
be sufficient for vs to knowe and consider, that he was one of
the most excellent, singular, and speciall Apostles, and therefore
a méete witnesse of the Lord Iesus.

to make vnitie and peace betwéene neighbour and neighbour.
                  Maister,Luke. 12. 13 bid my brother diuide the inheritaunce with me,
Christ answered: Man, who made me a Iudge or a diuider ouer
you. ¶Christ came indéede to be iudged, and not to iudge, hée
came to worke the worke of our redemption, not to decide controuersies,
touching landes and possessions. The Anabaptists
vse this text for one of their reasons to condempne magistracie
amonge Christians: and therefore a verye learned and late
writer in his exposition of this place, writeth thus: Hinc colligitur,
&c. Héereof it may be gathered, howe greatlye they
doate which condemne Magistrates among the Christians by
this place. For Christ doth not reason of the thing it selfe as
though it were prophane, but of his owne vocation, because hée
was sent to another end, although the thing it selfe is holy and
good.

¶Héere it seemeth such to be reproued which iudge others (and
that not amisse) when as yet they themselues liue in the selfe
same wicked actes: Let vs sée whether their opinion bée vpright
which thinke that such Iudges cannot nor ought not to
giue sentence against others which are accused vnto them,
they themselues being guiltie of the selfe same fault, but this
were to ouerthrowe all publike wealths, and vtterly to take away

iudgements. Neither doth Paule héere anie thing serue
for the maintenaunce of this opinion, but onelye sheweth that
they most grieuouslye sinne, which with a greate seueritie punish
others, and ouerpasse themselues. They ought vndoutedly
first to correct and amende themselues, but yet Paule biddeth
them not to forsake the office committed vnto them. They
vse also for this purpose to recite the saieng of Christ vnto them
which accused the adulterous woman: Hee which among you
is without sinne, let him cast the first stone at her. But this sentence
of Christ is not against iust punishments & lawful iudgements.
Neither commaunded he them that they should not goe
forward in accusing the woman whom they had taken in adulterie.
He himselfe was no Magistrate, but the most high Preacher
of God, therefore that which was his office to doe, he executed,
in perswading those hypocrits to repentance. And he wold
haue them first héerevnto to haue a regard by a liuely faith and
repentaunce to deliuer themselues from the sins whereof they
wer guiltie. Neither forbad he, but y• they shuld execute y• which
the law of Moses commanded, &c.

There shall be sixe thousande yeares of this worlde.
Two thousande shall bée voide (so they doe call the time which
went before the lawe) two thousande for the lawe, and two
thousand for Christ. In déede this saieng doth serue well to

space and ende of the worlde, it canne bée of no authoritie
at all. Lactantius doth also determine this worlde at the
sixe thousand. Augustine doth confute them which doth determine
the thousandes of this worlde, according vnto the number
of the dayes in the wéeke, affirming that the eyght daye
is a figure of the resurrection and ende of the worlde. As for
mée I am well contented to bée ignoraunt of that which God
woulde not haue mée to knowe, whereby I doe not allowe

matter and search the secretes of God, then according vnto the
admonition of the Lord, watch, walke in the study, and seeking

not for his owne worthinesse, but for Christs sake. Or thus:
a iust or righteous man is he, that exerciseth himselfe, in the kéeping
of Gods commaundements, so neere as God shal giue him
grace, and the infirmitie of mans corrupt nature will admitte.
But a iustified man is he, that hauing no Iustice or righteousnesse
in him before, is accepted of God for iust, his iniquitie being
pardoned, and his sinnes couered.

bringeth one thing, and some another, which rather belong to
some parte thereof, then whereby the whole is defined. In my
iudgement, we must first see, what it is to be iust, that thereby
we may come to the knowledge of Iustice, for of iust is deriued
Iustice. And to say briefely, to be iust, is to be cleare, sound and
vpright according to the degrée, condition, office & person which
euery man beareth, and to aunswere the same in all pointes,
without blame. Each degrée, condition, estate and person, hath

                  This word iustifie, in the Latine mens eares, is as much to
say, as to make iust: lyke as magnifie to make great, and sanctifie
to make holy. And this sence of this word, the Diuine
schoolemen like well, which they that doe followe them, doe yet
earnestly stand vnto. Augustine also doth in diuers places still
expound this word of iustifieng in this sence, when he saith, Beléeuing
in him which iustifieth the wicked, that is to say, of the
wicked doth make godly. The Apostle Paule out of whose writings
this entraunce of Iustification, is principally taken, vsed
the word of iustifieng, not in the sence that the Latine eares doe
like, but in that sence which the holy Scripture vseth it, according
to the custome of the holy language in which he was born,

brought vp and instructed in from his childhood. In that language
to iustifie, is as as much to say, as to quite a man of his
offence, and to pronounce him iust. The contrary of it, is to condemne
a man of naughtinesse and wickednesse, &c. This word
iustifie, is not to make one iust, which is vniust and wicked,
but is vsed in euery place for to quite a man of his fault, and to
pronounce and declare him iust.

                  It is also the cause why Faith is plainly called by S. Paule,
the Faith of the chosen, and for the which Iustification is attributed
vnto it: that honour is giuen vnto it, forsomuch as many
doth acknowledge himselfe by the same, such as he is of his
owne nature: to wit a poore and miserable sinner, the childe of
wrath, subiect to death and eternall damnation, therefore, spoyling
himselfe of his owne Iustice, and of all trust in his owne
workes and merites, he doth imbrace Iesus Christ, to be cladde
with his Iustice, to the ende, that by it his sinnes may be couered,
in such sort that they come not to count at the iudgement
of God, and so that the poore sinner by reputed iust, as though he
had neuer offended, and that because the Iustice of Christ is allowed
vnto him Faith, as though the same were proper to
the man, to whom it is allowed.

                  All men are sinners and want the glory of God, but they are
iustified fréely by his grace, through the redemption that is in
Christ. ¶Héere Paule saith, We are iustified fréely. If there bée
any deseruing lesse or more, then it is not freely. He saith also,
Of grace, if it be any part of workes, then it is not of grace, for
as S. Paule saith, Then grace were no grace. S. Ambrose saith
vpon this place of S. Paule: All men are sinners, &c. They
are iustified fréely (saith S. Ambrose) for they doing nothing,
nor nothing deseruing, alonely by Faith are iustified, by the
gifte of God. Héere Saint Ambrose saith, Men working nothing,
nor nothing deseruing, are iustified by Faith onely.

it is plaine by Origen, that workes doe helpe nothing to Iustification, but Faith onely.

                  What thing doth purchase Iustification.
                  The same thing that purchaseth remission of our sinnes, doth
also purchase Iustification. For Iustification is nothing els but
remission of sinnes. Now Faith purchaseth vs remission of
sinnes, Ergo by Faith we are iustified. Now, that Faith purchaseth
remission of sinnes is well proued by the Article of our
Faith, Credo remissionem peccatorum. I beléeue remission of
sinnes. Now if I haue not this remission for Faith, then Faith
deceiueth me. For I doe beleeue onely, because I would haue
remission of sinnes. What néede we to beléeue remission of
sinnes, if I may deserue it by workes.

                  What the true way of Iustification is.
                  The very true way of Iustification is this: First commeth
God for the loue of Christ Iesus, alonely of his méere mercie,
and giueth vs fréely the gifte of Faith, whereby we doe beléeue
God and his holy word, & sticke, fast vnto the promises of God,
and beléeue that though heauen and earth, and all that is in them
should perish and come to naught, yet God shall be founde true
in his promise. For this faith sake be we the children of God.
This is not such a Faith as men dreame,The historical Faith when they beléeue
that there is one God, and beléeue that he is eternall, beléeue also
that he made the world of naught, yea and beléeue that the
Gospell is true, and all things that God speaketh, must be true
and fulfilled, with other such things. This is not the Faith that
we be iustified by, for Diuells and Infidells haue this faith, and
also we may atteine to these things by the strength of reason
                        •
                     
But the Faith
                        •
                     
                     The iustifieng Faith. that shall iustifie vs, must be of another manner
of strength: for it must come from heauen, and not from
the strength of reason. It must also make me beléeue that God
the ma
                        •
                     er of heauen and earth, is not onely a Father, but also
my Father, yea, and that through the fauour that Christ hath
purchased me, from the which fauour, neither heauen nor earth,
tribulation nor persecution, death nor hell can deuide me. But

to this sticke I fast, that he is not alonely my father, but also a
merciful father, yea, and that vnto me mercifull, & so mercifull,
that he will not impute my sins vnto me though they be neuer
so many nor so great, so long as I hang on the blessed bloud of
Christ Iesus, and sinne not of malice, but of frailtie and of no
pleasures.

                        •
                     us was iustified.
                  Cornelius a Gentile did great almes,Act. 10. 4. and praied vnto God
alwaies, vnto whome the Angell spake on this maner: Thy
praier and thine almes, are come vp into remembraunce in the
presence of God. Of this text some doe gather, that his good
workes did helpe to Iustification.
               
               
                  The solution.
                  The Holy ghost hath openly declared himselfe there: for he
saith that this Cornelius was a deuout man, and one that feared
God. How could this be, without that God had taught him
inwardly by Faith. Yea, how could he know God, and that deuoutly,
but by faith: Ergo he was iustified before God by his
Faith, but the world knew not his Iustification. And therefore
the Holy ghost doth declare his inward Iustification, when hée
saith that he was deuout and feared God. And also doth showe
openly the fruits of his Iustification, when he saith that he did
Almes. Moreouer you haue there that the Holy ghost fell on
them afore they were baptised in water, the which declareth
openly, that they were iustified before God. This well declareth
in your owne lawe, whose words be these: Cornelius Centurion
being yet an Heathen man, was made cleane by the gifte
of the Holy ghost afore all good workes, for he was an heathen
man.

Ambrose expound on this wise: They working nothing, nor
acquiting him any whit, are iustified by Faith alone by the gift
of God. This word Fréely (although many be therewith offended)
is also euidently expressed by Paule himselfe in these words:
Fréely without the lawe, without workes, it is a gifte and such
lyke, which thou maist marke, for they are all one with this foresaid exposition of S. Ambrose. By Faith alone we are iustified,

which saieng signifieth thus much, onely by the beliefe

Christs bloud doth saue vs, are we pro

art thou bound, and called to walke in them, and must earnestly
studie and indeuour thy selfe to leaue none of them vndone:

vnderstood (saith S. Austen) that we may knowe that they can
no otherwise be the doers of the lawe, except they be first iustified,
not that Iustification belongeth vnto doers, but that Iustification
doth procede all manner of doing. ¶Thus by the minde
of S. Augustin, we see that Iustification is first giuen, that men
might be able to doe the workes of the lawe. This is also the
exposition of the common glose.

with our Father, he is the forgiuenesse of our sinnes, he
that helde this, was in no heresie, he that helde this was in no
schisme. For whereof came the schismes? Truly when men do
say, we be iust: when men do say, we do sanctifie them that be
vncleane, we do iustifie the wicked, we do pray, and we doe obtaine.
But what saith Iohn? If a man doe sinne, we haue an
Aduocate with the Father Iesus Christ, &c. ¶Thus saith he,
by which words, he did no more touch the Donatists, then hée
should now a dayes if he were a lyue, gall them which doe so

                  How God doth iustifie vs.
                  We said in the first Article of the word of iustifieng, that to
be iustified is as much to say in this matter according to y• meaning
of the Scripture, as to be acquited by grace from sinne, &
to be taken for iust. Therefore God doth so iustifie vs, that hee
forgiueth our sinnes, he hideth them, & doth not charge vs with
them any more, but doth rather impute Iustice vnto vs, not

ours which is none, but the Iustice of his Sonne our Lord Iesus
Christ. And by this imputation of Iustice, he maketh vs
saued and blessed. So the Apostle doth foure times set forth this
Iustification to the Romanes, least we should séeme to bring any thing
with vs of our owne. Lyke as Dauid (saith he) doeth
expresse the blessednesse of y• man, to whom God imputeth righteousnesse
without workes, saieng: Blessed be they whose wickedness
be forgiuen, and whose sinnes be hidden. Blessed
is the man to whom God doth not impute sinne. It appeareth
verye well that the Iustification which is imputed by grace
without works is the forgiuenesse of sinne, & the help vnto saluation.
For where as he might haue said: Blessed hée they
whome God doth iustifie without workes, he saith: Blessed 
                        •
                     e
thou whose sinnes be forgiuen, and whose sins be hidden: Blessed
is the man to whom God doth not impute sinne.

                  There is two manner of IustificationsTwo iustifications. vnderstood in holye
Scripture, the one before God, the other before man. Of Iustification
before God, it is truly said of S. Paule. Rom. 4. 3. Credidit
autem Abraham, &c. Abraham beléeued God, and it was
imputed vnto him for righteousnesse. And of Iustification before
men S. Iames speaketh in the 2. chapter of his Epistle, verse. 21.
Abraham pater noster, &c. Was not our father Abraham iustified
through workes, when he had offered his sonne vp vpon the
Altar, &c. And y• he so ment, appeareth by his very words which
followeth within few lines after, thus: Credidit autem Abraham,
&c. Abraham beleeued God, & it was reputed vnto him for
righteousnesse, & he was called the friend of God. Thus wée sée
S. Paule & Lames reconciled, & both teach Iustification by faith, in the sight of God.

                  How God is iustified in vs.
                  To the end (saith S. Paule) that all months might be stopped,

and all the world acknowledge it selfe to be indebted vnto
God,Rom. 3. 19. and that he onely should be iustified. ¶After what sorte
is it, that God shall be iustified in vs, according to S.
Paule?
                  
                  To wit, when all of vs condemne our selues, and haue not the
boldnesse to striue against God, but doe willingly confesse, that
all of vs are indaungered vnto him: if we be once come to that
point, then is God iustified, y• is to say, his righteousnes is commended
by vs, with such praise as he deserueth. But contrariwise,
if men exalt themselues, and acknowledge not that they
be indaungered vnto God, so as may condemne them, nor confesse
the bonde of debt which they haue forfeited vnto him: although
they protest that they minde to iustifie him (that is to say
to confesse that he is righteous) yet neuerthelesse they condemne
him.

                  Aunswere.
                  In Iustification a pardon is graunted for sinnes past, and
not of sinnes to come. And if any man liue wickedly after Iustification,
without doubt he dispiseth the grace of iustification.

                  The iustifieng Faith is, as it were a flame of fire, which cannot
but cast foorth brightnes. And lyke as y• flame burneth the wood,
without the helpe of the light, and yet the flame cannot be without
the light so is it assuredly true, that Faith alone consumeth
and burneth away sinne, without the helpe of workes, and yet
that the same Faith cannot be without good workes. Wherefore
lyke as we sée a flame of fire that giueth no lyght, we know
by & by that it is but vaine and painted: even so when we see
not some light of good workes in a man, it is a token, that hée
hath not the true inspired Faith, which God giueth to his elect
and chosen, to iustifie and glorifie them withall. And hold it for
a certeintie that S. Iames meant so, when he said: Shewe me

thy faith by thy workes, and I will shew thée my faith by my
workes.

of this keye we speake off after S. Austen.

                  Christ (say they) appointed Peter Prince of the whole Church,Math. 18. 20.
when he promised that he would giue him the keyes. But that
which he then promised to one, in another place he gaue it also
to all the rest,Ioh. 20. 23 and deliuered it as it were into their hands. If
the same power were graunted to all, which was promised to
one, wherein shall he be aboue his fellowes? Héerein (say they)
he excelleth,De sim. Cleri. because he receiued it both in common. What if I
aunswere with Cipriane and Augustine, that Christ did it not
for this purpose to preferre one man before other, but so to sett
                        •
                     
out the vnitie of the Church, for thus saith Cipriane, that God
in the person of one, gaue the keyes to all, to signifie the vnitie of
all, and that the rest were the same thing that Peter was, endued
with like partaking both of honour and power: but the beginning
is taken at vnitie, that the Church of Christ maye bée
shewed to be one.Homil. in Iohn. 50 
                     Augustine saith: If there were not in Peter
a mysterie of the Church, the Lord would not say vnto him, I
will giue thée the keyes, for if this wer said to Peter, the Church
hath them not:Homi. 11. but if the Church hath them, then Peter when
he receiued them, betokened the whole Church. And in another
place when they were all asked, onely Peter aunswered, Thou
art Christ, and it is said to him, I will giue thée the keyes, as
though he alone had receiued the power of binding and loosing,

whereas he being one, said the one for all, and he receiued the
other withall, as hearing the person of vnitie. Therefore one
for all, because there is vnitie in all.

the Metaphore of keyes (not onely in the Scripture, but also by
the custome of men) betokeneth the ful authoritie and ordering

¶A keye is a token of power or authoritie and publike administration
receiued. Iohn therefore meaneth, that God in his
wrath, hath giuen power to Heretikes and deceiuers, to thrust
their diuelish opinions into the Church. Thou séest openly héere
(lyke as in many other places of the Scripture) how it happeneth
not but by Gods prouidence, that errours and vntruths
are brought in to deceiue men withall, wherevnto also hée giueth
such force & effectuall working, that they go for good payment,
as I said a little before. Therefore we sée héere, how
power is giuen to deceiuers and heretikes to set their errours
openly abroad, and to seduce fonde men by vaine Philosophie:
the doctrine of whom is rightly lykened to a bottomelesse pitte.
For looke as no man is able to gage the ground of a bottomelesse
pit: euen so the more a man followeth the doctrine of heretikes,
so much the lesse substauncialnesse, and proofe shall hée
finde. And in this place wee sée the Bishop of Romes Keyes,
which he boasteth off so greatly.

man ought to estéeme Satan (whom men call the Pope)

the blast of Lucifer. Also that no man ought to trust or put confidence
in the false Indulgences of couetous Priests, which Indulgences
doe draw away the hope, which men ought to repose
in God, to a sort of sinfull men, and doe robbe the poore of such
almes as is giuen to them: such Priests be manifest betrayers

liue so execrable a life, contrarie to the Gospell of Christ and example
of his Apostles, and teach not truly the Gospell, but onely
lyes, and the traditions of wicked and sinfull men: It appeareth
most manifestly, that they haue not the keyes of the Kingdome
of heauen, but rather the keyes of hell.Keyes of hell. And they may bée
right well assured, that God neuer gaue vnto them authoritie,
to make and establish so many ceremonies & traditions, which
be contrary to the libertie of the Gospell, and are blockes in
Christian mens wayes, that they can neither know nor obserue
the same his Gospell in libertie of conscience, and so attaine a

place, that the minde and purpose to do any work, is accounted
for the worke it selfe? Yea, if thou consider well, the intent
to doe any euill thing is worse then the worke it selfe, and the intent
to doe any good worke is better then the worke it selfe.
                  
                     
Better is the desire to doe good to those that are in misery, then
the Almes déede it selfe. And the intent to kill, is worse then the
murther it selfe. The Almes déede may be so done, that it may
displease God, concerning the which, reade the 5. of Mathew,
verse 42.Exo. 32. 28. A murderous déede may be so done, that it may please
God,Nu. 25 7. as may appeare in the Leuiticus, in Phinehes, in Iehu, and
so refused that God may be displeased for the not dooing of it,1. Re. 15. 33. as
we may sée in Agag,3. Reg. 20. Amalech, whom Saule kept alyue. But
the desire and intent to do good, cannot displease God, euen as

                  Of the Kings of Israel and Iuda, how many
were good.
                  Of all the kings that reigned ouer Israel and Iuda, there
were no mo but Dauid, Ezechias and Iosias,
                     3. good kings. that continued perfectly
vnto the ende of their liues, in the true religion of God,
not that these thrée were men of such perfection, that they did
not notably offende the lawe of God in their life time. But
these wer such men, that they wer neuer infected with the foule
sinne of Idolatrie, and wicked worshipping of straunge Gods.
Into other sinnes in déede they fell, and from the same
by true repentaunce obteined mercie and forgiuenesse a

Gods hand. So that notwithstanding both the murther & adulterie
of Dauid, & the foolish vaine glory of Ezechias, that shewed
all his treasure and all his secrets vnto the Ambassadours of
Babilon, for the which Esay the Prophet did openly reproue him
to his face. Yet otherwise they stoode vpright, kéeping themselues
pure and cleane, from the most detestable sinne of Idolatry.
And therefore Dauid strong in the armes and amiable of
countenaunce, and Ezechias which by interpretation is called
the health of our Lorde, and Iosias, Fortitudo Domini, the
strength of the Lord: These thrée doe beare the bell away, and
are preferred aboue all the Kings of Iuda, as we reade in the
Booke of Ecclesiasticus. 40. Chapter, where their praises are
commended to endure to the worlds ende.

the Leuites,1. Pa. 15. 11 to bring the Arke of the Lord God, into the place
which he had prepared for it.
                  
                     Salomon displaced Abiathar from the high Priests office,3. Re. 2. 35 &
put Sadoch into his roome.

                     se are not words of entreatie,
but flat commaundements, as Lyra saith: Ezechia cupiens
renouare foedus, &c. Ezechias desirous to renue the Couenaunt
with the Lord, first did commaund the Leuites to be sanctified.
Second, by them being sanctified, the Temple to be cleansed.
Thirdly, by those which were cleansed, sacrifice to be made
for the offence of the people. Fourthly, by sacrificing, God to be
praised. Fiftly, by cleansing, the holye Burnt-offerings to bée
offered vp. ¶Thus were all things done by his commaundement,
by his constitution, and at his pleasure, &c.

ouer the subiects, so much more ought we to be carefull in
those matters that apperteine vnto God. Either to augment our
owne hope, or else to looke to the profit of the people committed
to vs of God. And as ye sée me in very déede inflamed with
the seruice of faith, God hath stirred me vp to this end, that the
obstinacie of infidelitie béeing expelled, and the furie of discorde
remoued, I should reuoke the people to the knowledge of faith,
and to the fellowship of the Catholike Church, who serued errour,
vnder the name of religion. These be the wordes of this

and the Quéenes are named Nurses,Nurses. that although the ministrie
of féeding perteine to the Ministers, yet the prouision
for the foode, the ouersight that the children of God be duelye
fedde with the right milke, with the true bread and water of
lyfe, belongeth to the Princes, & therefore haue they the name
of Nurses, not to nourish children in ciuill matters and corporall

                     ode onelye, but as in ciuill, so in Lacte verbi, In the
milke of the worde of God also. Is this onelye the cherishing
of the good childe, by giuing lands, reuenews, maintenance,
and liuing to the Church? Is this onely the displing of the froward
childe, or as ye call it, the punishing of the heretike. No

Maister Stapleton, Lyra his exposition and yours doe not agrée.
He sayth they are Nurses, what to doe? To féede: whom?
The faithfull ones: wherewith? With the milke of the word:
what word? Euen the word and Sacraments of God. Whereof
sith the ministrie and execution belongeth not vnto them,
but vnto the Ministers: it followeth necessarye therevppon,
that the prouision, direction, appointing, care and ouersight,
which is the supreame gouernement, belongeth to them.
                  And this is that which Lyra confesseth, and thereby vrgeth
of Constantine that he was such another Nurse, as did kéepe,
defend, mainteine, vpholde, and féede the poore faithfull ones of
Christ, yea, carried them in his bosome as it were, and procured
them to be fedde, did set forth Proclamations, not onelye against
false religion, but also to sette forth, to exhort and allure,
vnto the christen fayth, caused not the Idolatrous religion to
be suppressed, but caused also on the other part, the true knowledge
& religion of Christ to be brought in, and planted among
the people, and did not onelye make lawes for punishing of heretikes
and Idolaters, but also reformed all manner abuses
about Gods seruice. Thus sayth the Bishoppe out of Eusebius,
did Constantine playe the Nurses parte.

                  How wicked kings are of God, and not
of God.
                  They haue reigned and not by me.Ose. 8. 4. They were Princes,
I knew them not. ¶These wordes are Gods complaint against
the wickednesse of those kings of Israel, that directed not theyr

gouernement by Gods lawe, not that they were not kings, but
that they were wicked kings, not that they wer by no meanes
ordeined of God, for Omnis potestas est a Deo, All power is of
God. And God saith in generall, Per me reges regnant, Kings
rule by me, so wel heathen as faithful kings. Pilates power was
from aboue. These kings of Israel, Ieroboam, Achab, Iehu, &c.
were of Gods ordeining. Yea Iehu, whose house héere GOD
complained vpon, and sayd, He and his ofspring raigned not by
him, were yet notwithstanding made kings & reigned by him.
In respect of their ambition and priuate affections, their reigne
was not of him. In respect of Gods ordinaunce, of his iustice,
of his prouidence, it was not onely permitted, but also especially
appointed of him, as both the Text is euident, and your own
Glose (meaning the Papists) cōfesseth for Ieroboam ye elder, y•
it was done by Gods will, although it were done also by the
peoples sinne that regarded not the will of God, but followed
their owne selfe will. And so in some respect it was not ye work
of God, and yet in other respects it was the worke of God. And
so héere he expoundes himselfe and sayth: I know them not, not
that he was ignoraunt of them, but he acknowledged not their
doinges. Secondly, neither the Prophet Ose, nor anie other
Prophet, tooke vpon them to depose any of those wicked kings,
but to declare the wrath and vengeance of God to come vpon
them, after which declarations, they did not subtract from them
their ciuill obedience, or counted them from that day forward,
no longer to be their kings, or exhorted the Church of God to
forsake their politike gouernement: but hauing declared their
message from God: they let them alone, till either God himselfe
did strike them, or stirred vp by some especiall or extraordinary
means, some forreine or domestical persecutor of them.
Thirdly, this maketh nothing to proue that those kings whom
the Pope taketh vpon him to pronounce, they be no kings, are
no longer kings: except he will make himselfe God, yea, and
aboue God too. For although God say, they reigne not by me,
yet he calleth them kings, but the Pope calleth them vsurpers
that reigne not by him.

                  Of two kinges, the one secceeding a good Father,
the other a wicked.

                           •
                        g. 21. when he succéeded

that godly king Ezechias his Father, was no sooner entered
into his kingdome, but the false Prophets of Baal (for lacke
of good gouernours) so be witched, and so farre seduced him, that
he vtterly forsooke all his Fathers wayes, to mainteine idolatrie,
witchcraft, sorcery, and such lyke wickednesse,A good man may haue a wicked sonne, & a vvicked man a good son. which turned
not only to his owne perdition, but also to y• vtter desolation
of Hierusalem and Iuda, for beholde sayth y• Lord: Because
Manasses hath done such abhominations, &c. I will bring such
euill vpon Hierusalem and Iuda, that who so heareth of it his
eares shall tinckle, and I will wipe out Hierusalem, as a man
wipeth a dish, and when he hath wiped it, turneth it vpside
downe. Iosias (on the other side) being of the age but of viii.
yeares, when he succéeded wicked Amon his Father,4. Reg. 22. was no
sooner entred into his kingdome, but through the speciall grace
of God & good gouernours, did that which was right in ye sight
of the Lorde, and walked in the wayes of Dauid his fore-father,
and bowed neither to the right hand, nor to the left. Wherfore
God sayd to him by his Prophetesse, Because thine heart
did melt, and because thou hast humbled thy selfe before me the
Lord, when thou heardest what I spake against this place, &c.
Beholde I will receiue thée vnto thy Fathers, and thou shalt
be put into thy graue in peace, and thine eyes shall not sée all ye
euills which I will bring vppon this place. These two were
both of them young kings, and immediate successours, the one
of Ezechias, who had extirped idolatrye by the roots, & the other
to a worshipper of false Gods, & otherwise also a wicked man.
And yet Manasses through peruerse in intifers, fell from GOD to
all naughtinesse. And Iosias being younger of age then hée,
did by the helpe of godly and faithfull Counsailours, apply himselfe
to all godlinesse, and thereby prospered.

vnto kings.
                  If a king be negligent in searching the workes of his enimyes,
and the hearts and wills of his subiects, he shall not long
be in suretie in his Realme. ¶The strength of a king is the
friendship & loue of his people. ¶The most secrete counsell of a
King, is his conscience: and his vertuous déedes are his chiefest
treasures. ¶Ye Kinges remember first your King, the
gouernour of all: And as you would be honoured of your subiectes,
so honour you him. ¶Use no familiaritie with no wicked
person. ¶Trust none with your secrets before yée haue
proued him. ¶Sléepe no more then shall suffice the sustentation
of your bodyes. ¶Loue righteousnesse and truth.
                  ¶Embrace wisedome. ¶Féede measurablye. ¶Rewarde your
trustye friends. ¶Fauour your communaltie, considering that
by it your Realmes are mainteined. ¶Loue learned men,
that the ignoraunt thereby may bée encouraged to learning.
                  ¶Defende the true and iust, and punish the euill dooers, that
other monished thereby, maye flée the lyke vices. ¶Cutte off
the stealers hande. ¶Hang vp the théeues and robbers,
that the high wayes may bée the surer. ¶Burne the Sodomits.
¶Stone the adulterers. ¶Beware of lyars and flatterers,
and punish them. ¶Suffer not the swearers to escape scot frée.
¶Uisite your prisoners and deliuer the vngultie. ¶Punish
immediatlye such as haue deserued it. ¶Followe not your

                  This worde (Did knowe) in the sacred Scripture, is vnderstoode
two manner wayes, sometime it is taken for the carnall

scientia,
that is, for knowledge or acquaintaunce, Helindius
and those of his sect doe vnderstande by this woorde (Knowe)
for the copulation betwéene man and wife. Whereas it is
certeine, that it ought to be referred to acquaintaunce, and
perfect vnderstandinge of anie thinge, for although Ioseph
was
hand-fasted or betrothed vnto Marie, yet the almightie hadde
by visions and dreames reuealed his will vnto him, as wée
hearde before in the first Chapter, where the Angell sayde,
Ioseph, Feare not to take vnto thée Marye to wife, for
that which is conceiued in her commeth of the holye Ghost.
And in the seconde lykewise: Arise and take the childe and
his Mother, and flie into Aegypt, and abide there vntyll I
bringe thée woorde. So that the knowledge that Ioseph had

was the sure and vndoubted faith of those thinges that were
reuealed vnto him from aboue. And that this worde (Knowe)
is taken Pro scientia in the Scripture oftentimes, it appeareth
by this place: The childe Iesus abode in Hierusalem,
and his parents knewe not of it.

both Moses and Helias that talked with him, notwithstanding

not onelye knowe them whome they knewe in this worlde,
but they shall knowe also the good people which they neuer
sawe, euen as perfectlye as though they had afore both seene

                     Now (saith he) if it be true that we haue set downe,Cal. ca. 17 sect. 16. the Sacrament
is not to be estéemed of his hand by whom it is ministred,
but as it wer of the hand of God, from whence it certainly
commeth. Héereof we maye gather that nothing is added or
taken from the dignitie of it, by him by whom it is ministred.
And therefore among men, if an Epistle be sent, so y• the hande
and seale be knowen, it skilleth not, who or what manner of
person carieth it. Euen so, it is sufficient for vs to knowe the
hand and seale of the Lord in his Sacraments, by whom soeuer
they be deliuered. Heere is the errour of the Donatists confuted,
who measured the worthinesse of the Sacrament, to the worthinesse
of the Minister. Such be now a daies our Anabaptists,
which denie vs to be right baptised, because we were baptised by
wicked and Idolatrous persons in the Popes Church, and therfore
they furiously vrge rebaptization, against whose folly wée
shall be sufficiently defended, if we thinke we were baptised in
the name of the Father, of the Sonne, and of the Holy ghost, and
therefore Baptime, not to be of man, but of God, by whom soeuer
it be ministred.

or any other Minister cannot be found, and the daunger of him

without this Sacrament, we haue heard that euen lay men hath
giuen the Sacrament that they haue receiued.

               LAIENG ON OF HANDS.
               
                  Whereof this custome of laieng on of hands arose.
                  THis custome of laieng on of handes, is taken of the olde Fathers.
For in Gen. 48. 14. The Patriarke Iacob laied his
hands vpon the head of Manasses and Ephraim the sonnes of Ioseph,
which custome afterward was confirmed to the Iewes for
a Lawe, and so continued till the comming of Christ, who vsed
the same, and deliuered the vse thereof vnto his Apostles, to the
which Ceremonie praier was then ioyned. As it doth appere in
the 19. of Mathew, when children were brought vnto Christ, that
he might lay his hands vpon them.
                  That he should lay his hands vpon them.Mat. 19. 13 ¶The laieng on

of hands, was a familiar signe among the Iewes, so often as
there was any solempne kinde of praier or blessing, as when
they offered sacrifice. We haue also an example in Isaac more agreeable
to the place, when he laid his hands vpon his sonne Iacob,
as though he did consecrate and offer him to God, that hée
might be the promised heire. That this was a common custome
among the Iewes, it is euident by another example of Iacob,
which blessed the two children of his sonne Ioseph, namely,
Ephraim and Manasses. But they were not wont to lay handes
of any man which were not endued with some notable power
and vertue, or set in some high office: Euen as the Apostle taketh
an argument of the blessing of Melchisedech, which blessed
Abraham: neither doth he faine the argument. For it is oftentimes
read, that ther were Priests chosen which might blesse
the people, euen as though God were present to blesse himselfe.
The manner of blessing was prescribed vnto Moses, by the
mouth of the Lord, when he said: Ye shall blesse the Children
of Israel, and say vnto them: The Lord blesse thee, and kéepe
thée: the Lord make his face to shine vpon thee: the Lord lifte
vp his countenaunce vpon thée, and giue thée peace. The like
we haue also in the 118. Psalme. Séeing therefore that the laieng
on of hands was an auncient solempne order of blessing among
the Iewes, it is no meruaile if the parents desire Christ
to vse this ceremonie in blessing their children.
Marlor. fol. 425.
                  
                  By the putting on of my hands,2. Tim. 1. 6 &c. ¶As in the Baptime,
the outward ministerie or mysticall washing doth regenerate,
wash away sinnes, cleanse and purge vs from our filthinesse:
so doth the imposition or laieng on of hands, giue vs the gift of
the holy Ghost. But the outward and mysticall washing, doeth
onely represent vnto vs, that in Christs bloud our sinnes are
cleane washed away.
                  When Mathias was chosen by lotte,Act. 1. 23 it is not to be doubted,
but that the Apostles after their common manner praied for him,
that God woulde giue him grace to minister his office trulye,
and put their hands on him, and exhorted him, and gaue a charge
to be diligent and faithfull, and then was he as great as the
best. Act. 6. When the Disciples that beléeued had chosen vij.
Deacons to minister to the Widdowes, the Apostles prayed,
and put their hands on them, and admitted them without any

more adoe. Their putting on of hands was not after the manner
of the dumbe blessing of our holy Bishops with two fingers,
but they spake vnto them, and tolde them their dutie, and gaue
them a charge, and warned them to be faithfull in the Lordes
businesse, as we choose temporall Officers, and read their dutie
vnto them, and they promise to be faithfull Ministers, and then
are admitted. Neither is there any other manner or Ceremonie
at all required in making of our spirituall Officers, then to
choose an able person, and then to rehearse him his duetie, and
to giue him his charge, and so to put him in his roome.

vpon his mouth.
                  Whereas Iob saith,Iob. 39. 37. he will lay his hand vpon his mouth:
it is a signe of protestation, that he will not procéede any further.
And y• manner of speach is rife in y• scripture. And it serueth to
do vs to vnderstand, that we must refrain our foolish appetites.
And that when our flesh tickeleth vs to speake, we must resist
it: as if it were by putting a mussell or bridle vpon our mouths
to refrain them. If a man were so wise of himselfe, as he wold
not be tempted to speake amisse, he should not néede to laye his
hande vpon his mouth, for he would refraine of his owne accord,
and he should néede neither stoppe nor barre. But now on
the contrary part, whereas it is saide, that we must laye our
hande vppon our mouth, is to doe vs to wit, that we haue
to fight against our fonde lusts and likings, which doe continually
make vs too hastie in speaking, insomuch that our tongue
shall still bée sharpe set, to cast foorth some thing or other, that
is nought woorth, against God, &c.

                     LAtria (after the minde of Dunce) is called an exteriour honouring,
or a bodely seruice, &c. If that be true, it followeth
that they giue that honour to stocks and stones, that onely pertaineth
to God, which doe any exteriour honour, whatsoeuer it
be. This word Latria. wherwith the simple people be deceiued,
is a Greeke word and after S. Austen, it signifieth no more but
seruice, which cannot be denied is giuen to stockes and stones.
Thinke you that the Children of Israel with their high Priest
Aaron could not haue made this Pope holye excuse, that they
were not so mad nor so foolish as to honor the golden Calfe, but
rather to referre the honour to the liuing God, they had a good
colour for them, for they knew none other God nor Saint but
him, and yet this excuse was not lawfull nor could be allowed,
when Moses came with the word of God. Marke also what hée
was that made the Calfe, not a foole nor ignoraunt person among
the people, or one of no authoritie: but the most wisest
man, eloquent & chiefe among them, which was to kéepe the people
together in good order. He also made a Calfe, with y• which
thing all their Fathers had pleased God in dooing Sacrifice
with them: So that they might well thinke that it might bée
acceptable to God, to bée honoured in the Image of a Calfe,
before any other Image. But all these colours is naked before
the word of God.

                  What the Lawe is, and what is to be vnderstood thereby.
                  THe lawe (saith Iustinian) is a facultie or science of the thing
that is good and right, as Celsus ther defineth. Or thus: The
lawe is a certaine rule or Canon to doe well by, which ought
to be knowen of all men. Cicero de lege saith, that the Lawe is
a certaine rule proceeding from the minde of God, perswading
right and forbidding wrong. So that the Lawe is a certaine
rule, a directory, shewing what is good, and what is euill, what
is vertue and what is vice, what profitable, and what disprofitable,
what to be done, and what to be left vndone.
                  ¶The Lawe is a doctrine that biddeth good, and forbiddeth
euill, as the Commaundements doe speake.

                  This word (Law) maye not be vnderstoode héere after the
common manner, as to vse Paules tearmes, after the manner of
men, or after mans wayes, that thou wouldest saye, the Lawe
héere in this place were nothing but learning, which teacheth
what ought to be done, and what ought not to be done, as it go

with mans lawe, where the lawe is fulfilled with outward
workes onely, though the heart be neuer so farre off, but God
iudgeth after the ground of the heart, yea, the thoughts of the
secret moouings of the minde. Therefore his law requireth the
grounde of the heart, and loue from the bottome thereof, and is
not content with the outward workes onely, but rebuketh those
workes most of all, that spring not of loue from the lowe bottome
of the heart, though they appeare outward neuer so honest
and good. As Christ rebuketh the Pharisies aboue all other
that were open sinners, and calleth them hypocrites, that is to
say, Simulars and painted Sepulchers, which Pharesies yet
liued no men so pure as pertaining to the outward deedes and
workes of the lawe. Yea, and Paule in the third Chapter of
his Epistle to the Philippians, confesseth of himselfe that as touching
the law he was such a one, as no man could complaine on,
and notwithstanding was yet a murtherer of the Christen, persecuted
them, & formented them so sore, that he compelled them
to blaspheme Christ, and was altogether mercilesse, as many
which nowfaine outward good workes are.

                     ¶We vnderstand by the lawe, these commaundements onely
which God gaue by Moses in two Tables of stone, wherein
is comprehended all the rest of the doctrine of God, contained in
the holy Scriptures. The good things which God alloweth and
requireth of vs, which we are bound to doe, and the euill that
displeaseth him, which we ought not to followe, and beside that,
it sheweth vs our offences and sinnes, and how we stand debters
vnto the iudgment of God, and preacheth vnto vs nothing
els, but the very wrath and cursse of him, which we haue deserued
in offending of him. By ye law we are all condemned before
God, as transgressors of all his commaundements, and thereby
declared worthy of death and eternall damnation. So that the
law serueth rather to condemne then to saue vs. And yet there
is no fault in the law, which is good, holy, and iust, but the fault
is in vs, which are wicked of nature, and doe not accomplish the
law. The law doth vtter our sinnes, and sheweth vs plainly our
disease, and how daungerous it is (as the Phisitions doth) but it
cannot heale vs, but sendeth vs to another, which is able to heale
our disease and none but he, one Christ Iesus our Lord. The
law is deuided into two parts: The first Table1. Table. pertaineth to
God, which is this: Thou shalt haue none other Gods but me:
Thou shalt make thée no Image, nor likenes, &c. Thou shalt not
take the name of God in vaine, &c. Remember to sanctifie the
Sabboth day, &c. The other Table pertaineth to our neighbour,
which are these: Honor thy father & thy mother, &c. Kil not: Commit
none adulterie: Steale not: Beare no false witnes against
thy neighbor: Couet not thy neighbors house, nor his wife, &c.
And all the doctrine comprised in these two Tables,2. Table. Christ reduced
into ij. points, which are these: Loue God aboue al things,
& thy neighbor as thy selfe: for all ye law & the Prophets depend
vpon these. ij. commaundements: Then whatsoeuer ye wold that
men should do vnto you, do ye the same vnto them.

                     Plato
                     Plato. in his Booke of Lawes of a Publike wealth, and in
Minos, séemeth thus to define the lawe, namely, That it is an
vpright manner of gouerning, which by conuenient meanes directeth
vnto the best ende, in setting foorth paines vnto the
transgressours, and rewardes vnto the obedient. This definition
maye bée most aptlye applyed vnto the Lawe of God,

yet there can be no such Law, vnlesse it be of God.

                  What the office and vse of the law is.
                  The vse and ende of the lawe is,Vse of the lawe. to accuse and condempne
vs guiltie, such as liue in securitie, that they may sée themselues
to be in daunger of sin, wrath & death eternall, that so they may
be terrified, & brought euen to the brinke of desperation, trembling
and quaking at the falling of a leafe. And in that they are
such they are vnder the lawe, for the law requireth perfect obedience
vnto God, and condemneth all those that doe not accomplish
the same. Now it is certaine that there is no man liuing
which is able to perfourme this obedience, which notwithstanding,
God straightly requireth of vs. The law therefore iustifieth
not, but condemneth according to that saieng. Cursed is he that
abideth not in all things that are written in the lawe. Therefore
he that teacheth the lawe, is a minister of the lawe, &c.

                  The law of nature is,Lawe of Nature. that light and iudgement of reason,
whereby we doe discerne betwixt good and euill. Thomas Aquinus
saith, that the law of nature is nothing els, but the perticipation
of the eternall law in a reasonable creature. That definition
indeede doth expresse vnto vs, of whom this iudgement &
light of reason commeth vnto vs, that is to say, from the eternal
law: but what it is, it declareth not. And that parte in a reasonable
creature, maye comprise also Angells, of whose nature,
heere is nothing in question. Other doe define this lawe more
largely in this sort: The lawe of nature is the common sentence
of iudgement, wherevnto all men together assent and furder,
which God graued in euery mans minde, appointed to frame
mens manners withall, &c.

by Moses, and which Moses comprehended in his booke of Exodus
and Leuiticus, Numery and Deuteronomy. This was deliuered
vnto Moses by Angels, and Steuen witnesseth saieng: Ye
haue receiued the lawe by the order of Angells. And the Apostle
saith, The lawe is giuen by Angells, in the hand of a Mediatour.
The same they doe commonly deuide, and well inough

for the purpose, into the Morall precepts, Iudiciall and Ceremoniall:
or into precepts, statutes and iudgements.Morall lavve. By statutes,

which they vse in the matters and controuersies of the policies,

                  How the Lawe is our schoolemaister.
                  The schoolemaster is appointed for the childe, to teach him,
to bring him vp, and to kéepe him as it were in prison, but to
what ende, and how long? Is it to the ende that this straight &
sharpe dealing of the schoolmasterschoolemaister. should alwaies continue? Or
that the childe should remaine in continuall bondage? Not so,
but onely for a time, that this obedience, this prison and correction
might tourne to the profite of the childe, that in time, hée
might be heire and Prince. For it is not the fathers will, that
his sonne should alwaies be subiect to the schoolemaister, and alwayes
beaten with roddes, but that by his instruction and discipline,
he may be made able and meete to be his fathers successour.
Euen so the lawe (saith Paule) is nothing els but a schoolmaister,
not for euer, but till it haue brought vs to Christ: as
in other wordes he said also before.Gal 3. 24. The lawe was giuen for
transgressions,Gal. 3 19 vntill the blessed séede shuld come. Also the scripture
hath all vnder sinne. Againe: we were kept vnder & shut vp
vnto faith, which should after be reuealed, wherefore the law is
not onely a schoolemaister, but it is a schoolemaister to bring vs
vnto Christ. What a schoolemaister were he, which would alwaies
torment and beate the childe, and teach him nothing at
all? And yet such schoolemaisters were there in time past, when
schooles were nothing els but a prison and a very hell, the schoolmaisters
cruell tyraunts and very butchers. The children were
alwaies beaten, they learned with continuall paine and trauaile,
and yet fewe of them came to any proofe. The Lawe is
not such a schoolemaister, for it doth not onely terrifie and torment
(as the foolish schoolmaister beateth his scholers & teacheth
them nothing) but with his rods he driueth vs to Christ: like
as a good schoolemaister instructeth and exerciseth his scholers in
reading and writing, to the ende they maye come to the knowledge
of good letters and other profitable things, that afterward
they may haue a delight in dooing of that, which before when

they were constrained thervnto, they did against their wils, &c.

was, nor neuer shall be, in his power to perfourme.

the voice of a trumpet and terrible sight. Exo. 20. 18.Exo. 20. 18 So that the
people quaked for feare, and stood a farre off, saieng vnto Moses:
Speake thou vnto vs, and we will heare, let not the Lord speake
to vs, least we dye. No eare (if it be awaked and vnderstand the
meaning) is able to abide the voice of the lawe, except the promises
of mercie be by. That thunder, except the raine of mercie
be ioined therewith, destroieth all, and buildeth not. The law is
a witnesse against vs, and testifieth that God abhorreth the sins
that are in vs, and vs for our sinnes sake.

                  The lawe was giuen (saith S. Austen) that man might finde
himselfe, & not to make his sicknesse whole, but by his preaching
the sicknesse increased, the Phisition might be sought. Wherefore
the lawe threatning & not fulfilling that thing that he commaundeth
maketh a man to be vnderneth him. But the law is
good if a man vse it wel. What is that to vse the law wel? By
ye law to know our selues, & to séeke Gods help to help our health.
¶Héere we sée by S. Austen, that the commandements of God
giueth vs no strength, nor yet declareth any strengh to be in vs,
but sheweth vs our dutie and weaknesse, and also mooueth vs,

nor to vnderstand it aright, or wrote it in any mans hart to consent
that it was good, and to wish after power to fulfill it: But
Christ giueth grace to doe it, and to vnderstand it aright, and

that if we haue no more, but the doctrine that is contained in the

cast away without any remedy. Then if God indite vs but according to the forme of y• lawe, he shall discouer filthines inough

                  What the lawe of God requireth.
                  The lawe of God requireth loueLoue. from the bottome of the
heart, and cannot be satisfied nor fulfilled with the workes therof
as mans lawe is, for the lawe is spirituall as S. Paule saith
Rom. 7.Rom. 7. 14 which no earthly creature by his owne strength & enforcement
is able to fulfill, but by the operation and working
of the spirit of God.

                  What it is to be vnder the lawe.
                  To be vnder the lawe,Vnder the lavve. is to deale with the workes of ye law,
and to worke without the spirit and grace, for so long no doubt,
sinne raigneth in vs through the lawe, that is to say, the lawe
declareth that we are vnder sinne, and that sinne hath power and
domination ouer vs, séeing we cannot fulfill the lawe, namely,
with the heart, forasmuch as no man of nature fauoureth the
lawe, consenteth therevnto, and delighteth therein, which thing
is excéeding great sinne, y• we cannot consent to the lawe, which
lawe is nothing els but the will of God, &c. So that to be vnder
the lawe, is not to be able to fulfill the lawe, but to be debter
to it, and not able to paye that, which the Lawe requireth,
&c.

that extinguished in vs, by which the law accuseth and condemneth
vs, and that is, the olde man, the flesh, naturall lust & corruption
of nature: when these things be once dead in vs, & that
Christ liueth and raigneth in vs, we can by no meanes be condemned
by the law, &c.

                  Tell me, ye that would be vnder the law, &c.Gal. 4. 20 ¶Why doth
Paule call the booke of Genesis out of the which he alledgeth the
historie of Ismael and Isaac,
                     Booke of Gene. called the Lawe. the Lawe, séeing that booke containeth
nothing at all concerning the law, but onely containeth a
plaine historie of Abrahams two children? Paule is wont to call
the first booke of Moses the law, after the manner of ye Iewes,
which although it containe no lawe besides the lawe of circumcision,
but the principall doctrine thereof is concerning faith, and
that Patriarks pleased God because of their faith, yet ye Iewes
notwithstanding, onely because of the law of circumcision which
is there contained, called the booke of Genesis the lawe, as well
as the other bookes of Moses, so did Paule himselfe also being a
Iewe. And Christ vnder the title of the lawe, comprehendeth
not onely the bookes of Moses, but also the Psalmes.Psa. 35. 19

But it is that the words might be fulfilled which were writen

                  The Pelagians (saith S. Austen) thinke themselues cunning
men,Lavv impossible. when they say, God would not commaund that thing that
he knoweth a man is not able to doe, & who is there that knoweth
not this? But therefore God commaundeth vs to do some
thing that we are not able to doe, that we may vnderstand, what
we ought to craue of him.

the power of the diuell, and are his possession and kingdome, his

S. Hierome) no man kéepeth the lawe: therefore it is said that
the beléeuers must be saued by faith onely. Moreouer he will

                  How the poore and rich are matched together.
                  RIches are not condemned in themselues, as we sée how our
Lord Iesus Christ hath shewed vs, by matching the poore
and the rich together in the kingdome of heauen, when he speaketh
of Lazarus in S. Luke. He saith there, that the Angels carried
Lazarus: for albeit he was an out-cast among men, and a
poore creature of whom no account was made, insomuch that
he was forsaken of all men: yet neuerthelesse behold how y• Angels
carrie his soule into Abrahams bosome. And what was
this Abraham? A man rich both in cattell & monie, & in householde,
and in all other things sauing houses and lands, for these
were not lawfull for him to haue, because it behoued him to
tarrie Gods leasure, till he gaue him the land of Canaan to inherit.
True it is that he purchased a burieng place, but he had
not anie inheritance, notwithstanding that his moueables wer
verie great. Therefore when we sée the soule of Lazarus carried
by the Angels into the bosome of Abraham, who is the Father
of the faithfull: we perceiue that God of his infinite grace
and goodnesse calleth both rich and poore vnto saluation.

with their hands the work of God which they saw with their
eies. For he which had sent away death with the power of his
word, could either haue made the graue clothes to haue falne of
by their owne accord, or els y• 
                     Lazarus should haue vnwound
himself. But Christ would haue ye hands of ye standers by, to be
witnesse of the same. But too rediculous are y• Papists, which
vpon this place ground their auricular confession. Christ (saye
they) wold haue Lazarus after he had restored him to life, to bée
loosed by his disciples: therfore it is not sufficient for vs to be reconciled
to God, except the church also forgiue vs our sinnes.
But whervpon do they define & gather that the office of loosing
Lazarus was enioined the disciples, we rather gather by ye text,
that it was enioyned the Iewes, to ye end they might haue all
scruple of doubting taken from them. Therfore this place serueth
no more their turne for auricular confession, then doth y•

                  There are thrée kinde of leagues: The first kinde is, when
the conquerours set lawes to those whome they haue conquered,
in punishing them, and commanding them, what they will
haue them afterward to doe. The second kinde is, when things
being yet soūd, & neither part ouercome, they cōmune togethers
that things taken from the one part, may be restored, and couenaunts
of peace may bée established. The third kinde is, when
there is no warre betwéene the parties, and certeine Princes
or cities are ioyned together by some couenaunts, either to liue
the more peaceably, or els to take in hand some cōmon affaires,
&c.

               LENT.
               
                  Wherevpon the Lenten fast was grounded.
                  THere is none other cause of this fasting, thē of y• which Moses
fasted, when he receiued the law at the hands of y• Lord.
For sith y• miracle was shewed in Moses to stablish the authoritie
of ye lawe, it ought not to haue ben omitted in Christ, least
the Gospell should séeme to giue place to the lawe. But since
that time it neuer came in any mans minde vnder coulour of
following of Moses, to require such a forme of fasting in ye people
of Israel. Neither did any of ye holy prophets & fathers follow
it, when yet they had minde and zeale inough to godly exercises,
for that which is sayd of Helias, that he fasted fortie daies
without meate or drinke, tendeth to none other end, but that
the people should know, that he was stirred vp to be a restorer
of the law, from y• which almost all Israel had departed. Therfore
it was a more wrongful zeale and ful of superstition, y• they
did set forth fasting with the title & colour of following Christ.

Howbeit, in the manner of fasting, there was then great diuersitie
as Cassiodorus rehearseth out of So
                           •
                        rates in the ninth
booke of his historie. For the Romanes (sayth he) had but thrée
wéekes, but in these thrée was a continuall fasting, except on
the Sundaie, and Saterday. The Slauonians and Grecians had
sixe weekes, other had seauen. But their fasting was by diuided
times, and they disagréed no lesse in difference of meates.
Some did eate nothing but bread & water: some added hearbs:
some did not forbeare fish and foule: some had no difference in
meates. Of this diuersitie Augustine also maketh mention in
the latter Epistle to Ianuary.

                  Why the Fathers instituted Lent.
                  The Fathers when they sawe men liue very carelesly and
negligently, thought it good that they should be compelled after
a sort to renew godlynesse in some part of the yeare, & somwhat
to bridle ye fiercenes of y• flesh. And for this thing they thought
that the fortie daies before Easter were most méet, that men
should so long haue their mindes both occupied in repenting, &
also in remēbring y• benefits of God. This inuention although
at the first sight it might séeme trim, yet it agréeth not with
Christs libertie. For we must think vpon the benefits of God,
and our great ingratitude, & other most gréeuous sinnes, not
only fortie daies, but also continally. Further, by this meanes
they opened a most wide window to liue securely & rechlye.
For if they once had performed fullye these fortie daies, they
thought that all the whole yeare after they might giue themselues
wholy to all kinde of pleasures & lusts. For they referred
the time of repentaunce to these fortie daies. And although
the elders had a Lent, yet as Eusebius saith in his. 5. booke, and
24. Chapter) it was left frée vnto all men. For Ireneus after
this manner, intreated with Victor Bishop of Rome, when he
would have excommunicated the East Church, because in the
obseruing of Easter, it agréed not with the Church of Rome:
What (sayth he) can we not liue at concord, although they vse
their owne cities as we vse ours: for some fast in Lent two
dayes, some foure dayes, some x. daies, some fiftéene daies, some
twentie, and other some forty dayes. And yet is concord neuerthelesse
kept in the Church.

               LETANIES.
               
                  What the Letanies are.
                  LEtanies are nothing else but humble praiers and supplications
to God, to procure his fauo
                        •
                     r, and turne awaye his
wrath, and wer receiued long before procession came in place.
Some be called Minores, the lesse: some Maiores the greater.
The lesse were instituted by Mamartus Bishop of Vienna in
the yeare of our Lord. 469. as Sigebertus sayth, 02. 488. as Polichronicon
reporteth. The order of them was but a solempne
assembly of people vnto prayer, at such time as we call the rogation
wéeke. The cause was for earthquake and tempests,
and inuasion of wilde beasts which then did greatlye destroye
the people. The greater Letanie was deuised by Gregorie the
Pope, Anno. 592. When as the cause béeing lyke as before,
the superstition beganne to be more, for by the reason of a
great pestilence following a floud, the Bishoppe by Ceremonies
thought to appease the wrath of God, and therefore made
Septiformen Laetanian, a seauenfold Letanie: One of the clergie,
an other of the Monks: one of men, an other of their wiues:
One of maidens, an other of widowes: the last of poore and
children together. These people so distinct in the seauen orders,
shoulde come from seauen seuerall places, and then it was
thought they should be heard the sooner: but in their Procession,
fourescore persons were striken with the plague, to shewe
howe well God was pleased with them. Notwithstanding,
how thinges of a good deuotio
                        •
                      instituted, in time doe growe
to great abuse. For what the order and solempnitie of them
was, we reade in the counsell of Mentz, celebrated. 813. yeares
after Christ. The words of the decrée be these: Placint nobis,
&c. Our will is, that the greate Letanie bée obserued of all
Christians thrée daies. And as our holye Fathers haue ordeined
it, not riding, nor hauing precious garments on them, but
bare footed in Sackcloth an Ashes, vnlesse infirmitie doe let.
Thus farre the Counsell.

                  What the Letter signifieth.
                  AVgustine in his third booke and. 5. Chapter De doctrina
Christiana writeth, that they sticke in the Letter, which
take the signes for the thinges, and that which is figuratiuely
spoken in the holy Scriptures, they take it so, as if it were
spoken properlye. And so lowe crope they on the ground, that
when they heare the name of the Sabboth, they remember nothing
but the seauenth day, which was obserued of the Iewes.
Also when they heare of a Sacrifice, they thinke vppon nothing
but the sacrifices which were killed. And though ther bée
some seruitude tollerable, yet hée calleth that a miserable seruitude,
when wée take the signes for the thinges, wherein
there is a greate offence committed in these dayes in the Sacrament
of the Eucharist, for howe manye shall a man finde,
which beholding the outwarde signes of the Sacrament, calleth
to memorye the death and passion of Christ, whereof
it is most certeine that they are signes, or which thinketh
within himselfe that the bodye and bloud of Christ is a spirituall
meate for the soule through fayth, euen as breade
and wine are nourishmentes for the bodye? Or which weigheth
with himselfe, the coniunction of the members of Christ,
betweene themselues, and with the head. These thinges are
not regarded, and they cleaue onelye to the sight of the signes,
and men thinke it is inough if they haue looked vppon,
bowed the knée and worshipped. This to imbrace the Letter,
and not to giue eare vnto the sayde Augustine, who in the
place wée haue now cited, and a little afterwarde most appertlye
affirmeth, that to eate the bodye of Christ and to drinke
his bloud are figuratiue kinde of speaches. So are the Iewes
accused because they cleauing onely to the Letter and circumcision,
were transgrassers of the lawe.

                  For the Letter killeth,2. Cor. 3. 6. but the Spirit giueth lyfe.
                  ¶The Letter héere and in the seconde to the Romanes, verse.
27. and in diuerse other places of the Scripture, signifieth the
Lawe or olde Testament, and the Spirit, the Gospell or new
Testament. And so doth Saint Austen expounde them in
sundrie places of his booke, which hée wrote of the letter and

the spirit. And Erasmus also, both in his Paraphrases and Annotations.
Because the lawe findeth vs guiltie, and thervpon condemneth
vs, therefore saith the Apostle rightly, that it killeth.
And the gospel because it pronounceth vs righteous in Christ,
and sheweth vs that by him we are iustified from all thinges,
whereof we could not be iustified by the lawe. Act. 13. 39. doth
therefore bring lyfe. As for such as by the letter, will vnderstand
the litterall sense, and by the spirit the spirituall sense can
no learned or christen man allowe. For these wordes, Letter,
ministration of death, ministring of condemnation, and that
which is destroied, signifieth all one thing. And these, Spirit,
Ministration of righteousness, and that remaineth, be there
verie contraries. Now wordes meaning one thing, must haue
one interpretation. And by some of the first cannot the litterall
sense be vnderstoode, nor by some of the last the spirituall. Ergo
neither by these wordes Letter or Spirit, sith Letter is all one
with the first, and spirit with the latter.

Euen in the Gospell there is a Letter that killeth. For when
as Christ sayth: Unlesse ye eate the flesh of the sonne of man,
&c. If ye take the same according to the Letter, the Letter
killeth.
                  What is Littera occidens, the murthering Letter? Truely
the lawe which causeth anger by which commeth knowledge
of sinne, which is a Schoolemaster vnto Christ. The lawe first
killeth, y• Christ may make aliue, it condemneth y• Christ may
iustifie, it sheweth sinne, it healeth sinne.

                  Leuen is sometimes taken in an euill sense, for the doctrine
of the Pharesies, which corrupted the swéetnesse of the word
of God, with the leuen of their gloses. And sometime in a good
sense, for the kingdome of heauen, that is to saye, the Gospell
and glad tidings of Christ. For as leuen altereth the nature of
dowe, and maketh it through sowre, euen so the Gospel turneth
a man into a new lyfe, and altereth him a little and little, first
the heart, and then the members.

As in the. 13. 33. and in the 12. of Saint Luke. verse. 1. it is noted

                  How this place following is to be
vnderstood.
                  For the Leuites were purer hearted to bée sanctified then
the Priestes. ¶Pelicane translateth the wordes thus: Leuitae
quip 
                           〈…〉
                         
                        
                           〈…〉
                         ritu, &c. For the Leuites were sooner or
easier sanctified then the Priestes, which he expoundeth more
plainely in his Commentaries, saieng: Intiligitur Sacerdotum
numerum imminutum fuisse, &c. It is to bée vnderstoode
that the number of the Priestes was diminished, which should
haue sufficed for to prepare the Sacrifices,
                        
                           〈…〉
                        
                      and therefore they
desired the helpe of the Leuites, that all thinges might bée
done more diligentlye. There was also an other cause of the
Leuites helpe, for the sanctifieng of the Temple, and the preparation
of the Sacrifice was so sodeinly commaunded that
many of the Priestes had not time to sanctifie themselues according
to the lawe, which required a certeine space for the
same, and the Leuites might bée sanctified with lesse adoe, and
in shorter time. And surelye the verye circumstaunce of the
place doe proue this to be the true vnderstanding of it:
for these be the wordes that immediatelye goe before: but the
Priests were too fewe and were not able to sleye all the burnt
offeringes, therfore their brethren the Liuites did helpe them,
vntill they had ended the worke, and vntil other Priests were
sanctified.

speake against the minde, for lyers speake otherwise then
they haue in their hearts. But the desire to deceiue is vtterly
against iustice and amitie, which we mutually owe one to an
other. There are thrée things therfore in a lye: First to speake
that which is false: secondly his will in speaking: and thirdly
desire to deceiue. The first part longeth to the matter:
The other two partes perteine vnto the forme.

truth, he condemneth himselfe, and if he make a lye he saueth
himself. The vertuous man (saith he) ought rather to choose to
be ouercome with truth, then to ouercome by lyes: for it is vnpossible,
that a man which is a lyar, shoulde continue longe in

whether he be there or no? He aunswereth, that if thou be of
a valiant courage, and as it becommeth a Christian, thou must
saye where he is, I knowe but I will not vtter it, doe ye what
ye will. But when the matter commeth to this point, that for
the safetie of any mans life thou must make a lye, know thou
that thou oughtest to commit the thing vnto God, & that thou
hast nothing therein more to doe. Either thou must answere
that thou wilt not betray him, or els thou must hold thy peace.
But by thy silence the murtherer will suspect that he is in thy
house, and thou shalt séeme to giue occasion of his taking.
                  But in verie déede thou hast not so done, for thou canst not let
him to thinke what he will. Wherefore the matter is rather
to be committed vnto God, then that thou shouldest make a lie.
Howbeit thou must verie well weigh with thy selfe, namely,
to speake so, that thou say not al, and yet speake not falsely. For
in these cases I thinke it is not forbidden, yea, I iudge it is
most lawfull to speake doubtfully.

                  AND the life was the light of men. ¶This sentence is
sundrie wise expounded,Iohn. 1. 4. for some thinke that the meaning
is, that the lyfe which Gods sonne giueth creatures, shoulde
be a light to man, to shew them Gods sonne. Some take the
worde Life, for Gods sonne himselfe, as if Saint Iohn should
saye, that Gods sonne, who is verye lyfe, is the lyght of men.
Some other gather this sentence, that the lyfe, that Gods son
giueth to men, is adorned with vnderstanding and reason, and
aduaunced therevnto, whereby excelleth all other earthly creatures.
And these two latter expositions though they varye
somewhat in expressing the matter, yet come to this ende, that
Gods sonne is the authour of vnderstanding & reason in men,
which is a sound and a true sense, and may be most certeinly
gathered out of the words following, namely these: That was
the true light that lighteneth euery man, &c. Thus much than
maye be drawne out of this sentence, that Gods sonne being
the authour of vnderstanding, is verye God.

dye, euen as to take away the lyfe is to kill, how then sayth he,
that no man taketh the same from him? Did not the Iewes
kill him: yes verily. If they then killed him, they also toke his
lyfe away from him. Indéede they tooke it awaye, but they did
not extort it from him by violence, & against his will. For they

could not haue taken the same from him, except he would willingly
haue died.

                  Who is the true light.
                  THat was the true light.Iohn. 1. 9. ¶Héere the Euangelist putteth a
difference betwéene light and light. Iohn was a lyght indéede,
as the Lord sayth, Hée was a Candle burning and shining,
and Gods ministers are called the light of ye world. But
their light is a borrowed light, a light giuen vnto them, & not
naturallye dwelling in them. The Candle hath no light
of it selfe, but hath light sent into it of an other. This place
plainly seuereth the Lord Iesus frō creatures, for it affirmeth
him to be the true light, and denieth them to be the true light.
The Lord Iesus is light by nature, creatures by borrowing
of an other: he giueth light, creatures receiue light. They
neede lyght because they haue none by nature: he is full of
light and giueth lyght to them that need. Seeing then that there
is so great difference betwéene the Lords light and mans light,
the Lord must néedes be of an other nature then a creature.

For if a creature could be the true light, it could not be sayd,
of the sonne onely, that he is the true lyght. But because a creature
is not the true lyght, and Gods sonne is the true lyght,
therefore Gods sonne is another thing then a creature. No creature
can shine and giue light of it selfe by nature, Gods son
shineth and giueth light of himself naturally, for he is the true
light, so is no creature.

                  The true light is not héere opposed or compared to the false
light: but the Euangelist héere goeth about to putte a difference
betwéene our Sauiour Christ and all other, least that any
man should think that he is euen the same light & no better
then that which Angels and men are sayd to be. But this is
the difference that whatsoeuer is bright and shining in heauen
and in earth, it borroweth his brightnesse from another:
but Christ is lyght of himselfe, and shining by himslefe, and
lightening with his brightnesse the whole worlde, insomuch
that there is no other cause or originall of brightnesse but he.
He called therefore that the true lyght, to whose nature it is
proper to shine: Therefore this is he first note, by the which
Christ is discerned from Iohn, and from al other Apostles. For
Iohn and the Apostles were light, (as it is sayd before) but not
the true light, that is to say, not that naturall light which shineth
of it selfe, and which taketh not force to shine of anye
other. Such one is Christ, but Iohn and the Apostles not
so: for if the Lord had nto béene illuminated with this lyght,
they had béene altogether darknesse.

that by his light, he might direct you in the right way.
                  Therefore in that ye doe not know me to be the sonne of God,
your voluntarie errours is the cause thereof. Euen so they which
at this daye is willingly blinde in the mids of the light of the
Gospell, haue no excuse, for the Lord séeketh by the preaching of
his word to bring men out ot darknesse into light (in consideration
whereof, he calleth his Apostles the light of the world) that
the darknesse of ignoraunce being driuen awaye, the hearts of
mortall men maye be illuminated with the knowledge of God
and true pietie.

expounding this place saith thus:Caent. 6. 1. To gather vp Lilies, is
to gather vp men. And yet euen in this one exposition, resteth
to be handeled, that Christ is the gatherer, and men the flowers.
If christ be a gatherer, he is no disperser. Indéede it is méete
that the shepheard should gather his shéepe, and the hen hir chicken,
and the husbandman the graine into his barne. Euen so
the Prophet Ezechiel saith, that Christ should gather his sheepe
out of all land, and gather them into their owne land: so doeth
he himselfe say, with affection of déepe loue. O Ierusalem, Ierusalem,
how often would I haue gathered thée together, as the
hen gathereth hir chickens, and thou wouldest not. And as Lilies
grewe dispersed héere one, and there one, so good men growe
rare & thin. And as Christ picketh Lilies from among thornes,
for they growe among thornes: so picked he Abraham from the
thorns of Chaldee, Iob from the Hussites, Hyram from the Tyrians,
Naaman from the Sirians, the Niniuites from the Assirians,
Lylies grow rare, and good men grow rarer: lylies among
thornes, and good men among thornes: and as the gathering
of Lylies and men be like: so men and Lylies be very like.

S. Paule saith) goeth about like a roaring Lyon, séeking whom
he may deuoure. But it ought rather to be vnderstood of Nero

was on the earth, and such an vngodly Prince is as a Lyon,
and as a deuouring beare vnto his people. Pro. 28. 15.

                  How Lions are compared to the persecuters of Christ.
                  A Lyon is the Lord, and the fiercest of all other beastes of
the earth, whose propertie is to lye and lurke, and in a manner
to humble himselfe vntill he haue his praye, and then as it is
the propertie of a beare to roare when he is baited, so the propertie
of a Lyon is, when he hath got his pray to gape vpon it
and to roare, and neuer before. Of this propertie sauoureth the
sentence of the Prophet Amos. 3. Chap. ver. 4. saieng: Doeth

the Lyon roare in the woode, except he haue his pray? As who
should saye, the Lyons roaring and the Lyons praie, goe euer
together. Againe: Commeth there any plague within a Citie,
that is not of the Lords sending, no more (saith Amos) can ye
heare a Lyon roare without his praye. Of this propertie of a
Lion doth Aristotle write in lyke manner. li. 9. de natura animalium.
Chap. 24. And to this propertie of a Lion doth the Prophet
Dauid resemble the persecuters of Christ at his passion,
where he saith: Aperierunt super meos suum sicut Leo, They
haue opened their mouths wide vpon me as it wer a Lyon ramping
or roring. Another propertie that a Lyon hath, he is afraid
of nothing, except it be of the noise and rolling of a whéele-barrowe,
or a Timbrell, or some other lyke thing, as the noyse of
emptie Carts. And some write that he is afraid of the crowing
of a Cocke: so likewise the Lyons that put Christ to death, and
doe now spoyle the Common weale, were nothing afraide of
Gods displeasure, wrath and vengeaunce, but onely were afraid
of a silly rattle, as of the losse of their own vaine glory
and pompe, of the decay of their foolish superstitious traditions,
but nothing regarding the shedding of Christs innocent & most
precious bloud. A Lyon hath also this propertie, he loueth euer
to féede and to walke alone, not so much as the Lionesse shall be
in his companie, contrary to the nature of all other beasts: and
this propertie may be resembled to the greedie Lyons of this
world, that loueth to dwell alone, and to eate alone for any hospitalitie
they keepe in comparison of their liuing, as well as
vnto the Scribes, and Pharesies, and the high Priests, who
to maintaine their auarice and couetousnesse, cryed, Awaye
with Christ, crucifie him, crucifie him, we haue no King but
Caesar, let Moses and vs alone. &c.

and the teeth of the Lyons Whelpes are broken. ¶Though
men according to their office doe not punish tyrants (whome for
their crueltie he compareth to Lyons, and their children to
their Whelpes) yet God is able, and his Iustice will punish

               LONG LIFE.
               
                  How a good man may desire long life.
                  
                     THat it is no euill thing for a good man to aske of God long
life,Psal. 21. 4. may be gathered by the words of the Prophet, where
he saith, Vitam petijt a te, He hath asked life of thee. And what
meruaile is it if the iust man that is but a member of Christ,
doe aske long life in some cases, and at some times, séeing that
the naturall sonne of God, did in the fraile nature of his manhood,
desire of his father, that the Cup of his bitter passion might
passe away from him, and what was that els, but to desire to liue
still, or at the least not to dye then: neuerthelesse, he teacheth all
men how they shall pray in such a case, he vsed a kind of speach
called Correctio, a calling backe of words againe, saieng: Veruntamen
Pater non sicut ego volo, sed sicut tu vis: neuerthelesse
father, let it not be, as I in the nature of my manhood desire
it, but let it be done as thy diuine pleasure is. Thus to aske
long life, hauing no euill purpose or euill intent, as the rich glutton
had, which when he had inlarged his barns, belked out these
glorious words: Anima, habes bona reposita, Soule thou hast
much goods layd vp in store for many yeares, be merry, & make
good chéere. This foolish glutton did liue to eat, & not eate to liue.
And all they y• desire to liue for any such sensuall purpose, their
praier is not lawfull nor good: nay, it is not worthy to be called
a praier, but a carnall wish, so to desire to liue, is to desire to
be seperated from God, and to goe to the déepe dungeon of hell.
But to desire to lead a long life, to the end that he may the more
set foorth the glorie of God, and to doe good to the world, & not to
be an vnprofitable burthen vnto the world, as they be which do
nothing héere but marre malte, & wast wheate, Nati consumere
fruges, apt & borne to spend and to spoile. But to liue and labour
to doe good (as much as in them lieth) to all men, and hurt to
no man, their desire to liue long, is not to be doubted to bée a
thing lawfull, forasmuch as long life, is a blessing of God. And
if long life be one of the blessing of GOD, that he giueth to
his chosen and elect seruaunts, who can say that to aske long
life of God, is a carnall propertie. And to proue that long life is
the blessing of God. Read. Exo. 20. 12. Deut. 5. 16.
                     Ric. Turn.
                  
                  If the good desire to liue, it is for the great desire they haue
to doe good: but if the wicked or euill desire to liue, it is for that
they would abuse the world longer.

the stéede of Dominus regit me, Dominus pascit me. Which
may be Englished well, The Lord féedeth me, or, The Lord is
my shepheard. The Gréeke word Paiuosinou, signifieth Pascere
& regere, both to rule and to gouerne, and also to féede as the
shepheard feedeth his shéepe, and by a Metaphore, it is translated
and applyed very properly sometime to God himselfe, and sometime to
such men which héere in the earth are called by Office
to be the spirituall Pastours and Fathers of the Christian
flock. Arnobius in his briefe Commentaries doth properly write
vpon these words. Dominus regit me, & nihil mihi deerit, after
this manner: Dicant qui volunt, reget me ager meus, &c.
Let them say that lyst, my house and my land shall finde me: let
other say, my shéepe and my fat Oxen are store inough for mée,
and another make his boast of his Maister, another of his Merchaundise,
and he of his handie craft, and this man of his pen,
and that man of his profound learning: but I am at a point
saith the Prophet, and in this opinion will I dwel all the daies
of my lyfe: Dominus regit me, & nihil mihi deerit, The Lord
is my shepheard, and therefore I am sure neuer to lacke: Nihil
mihi deerit, I shall lacke nothing that shall be necessary and
good, both for the body or for the soule, &c.

                  I Am not sent but vnto the lost shéepe of the house of Israel.
                     Mat. 15. 21
¶Christ calleth them the lost shéepe vnto whom he is
sent: In which saieng, we haue two things to bée obserued.
First, that wée must acknowledge that we are all lost, or els
Christ hath nothing to doe with vs. We must euery one confesse
with the Psalmist, that I haue wandred lyke a lost shéepe,
O séeke then thy seruaunt. They therefore that are proude of
opinion of their owne good workes, and thinke to be saued by
their desertes, are not for Christ to meddle withall, for hée is
sent but vnto the lost shéepe of the house of Israel, or as he said
to the Pharesies, The whole haue no néed of the Phisition, but
the sicke. First therefore we must acknowledge, that we are altogether
cast away, and that we haue no more wit nor power
to retourne, or to saue our selues, then hath a shéepe that is
wandring in the Wildernesse among Wol
                        •
                     es, Beares, and
Lyons. Secondly, if we confesse and finde our selues to bee
such, then are we héere comforted, that is properly sent and appointed
of GOD, to saue the lost shéepe of the house of Israel,
lyke as he saith in another place: The Sonne of man is
come to saue that which was lost. And in Saint Lukes Gospell
concerning the conuersion of Zacheus: The Sonne of
man is come to séeke and to saue that which was lost.Luk. 19. 10 Therefore
it ought to be no discomfort vnto vs, to confesse that wée
are vtterlye lost, séeing thereby that we are assured, that wée
appertaine vnto Christ, who came of purpose to séeke and to
saue that which was lost. O the wonderfull wisedome,
power and mercie of GOD shewed vs in CHRIST,
that euen then, when we feele our selues lost, we are founde:

when we sée our selues destroied, we are saued: when we heare
our selues condemned, we are iustified: onely in beléeuing these
words, The sonne of man is come to saue that which was lost.
Let vs therefore with inuincible courage of faith, take holde
of these generall promises of God, and apply them vnto our
selues, as the poore woman of Canany did, and we shall finde
it to be true which our Sauiour Christ saith vnto vs, There is
nothing impossible, to him that beléeueth.

And as the Apostles in the first of the Actes, when they
sought another to succéede Iudas the Traitour, and two persons
were presented: then to breake strife, and to satisfie all parties,
did cast lottes whether should be admitted, desiring God to
temper them, and to take whom he knewe most meete, séeing
they wist not whether to preferre, or happely could not all agrée:
either is lawfull, and in all like cases. But to abuse them vnto
the tempting of God, & to compell him therewith to vtter things
whereof we stand in doubt, when we haue no commaundement

                  SOme in seeking for an order in loue, doe determine by the authoritie of S. Austine, that first we must loue God, secondly
our selues, thirdly our neighbours and bretheren, and fourthly
our owne body and our neighbours. But there is nothing
in Scripture touching any such order. Indéed Christ doth saye,

that the first Commaundement doth stand in the loue of God,
but he doth not giue the seconde place to the loue of our selues,
but vnto the loue of our neighbour, where as he saith in Mathew,
the second is like the first. So that there is a double error
committed héere by them which doe vncircumspectly and vnad
                     
                        •
                     isedly
follow Augustine. One, in that they do recken the loue
of our selues, amongst the kindes of loue commaunded vs,
whereas there is no Commaundement touching the same: for
it is naturally giuen to vs all to loue our selues, and that there
is no néede to giue any commaundement concerning this manner
of loue: And whereas the same is corrupted by the sin that
dwelleth within vs in our flesh, that corruption is not reformed
by commaunding vs to loue our selues, but by the loue of God,
of our neighbour and bretheren, which is prescribed vnto vs by
expresse precepts, to reforme the naturall affections of loue in
vs, and to direct them after a good order, wherefore it is not to be
feared that he which doth loue God, his neighbour and bretheren
aright, can neglect and cast away himselfe, albeit that he doe
wholly denie and refuse himselfe, and be addicted full and whole
to the glorie of God, and the saluation of his neighbours. The
other errour standeth, in that they place the loue of our selues,
next vnto the loue of God, whereas Christ doth assigne the second
place expressely, to the loue of our neighbour.

requireth. And first Tim. 1. 5. he saith, that the loue of a pure
heart and good conscience, and faith vnfained, is the ende & fulfilling
of the lawe. For faith vnfained in Christs bloud, causeth
thée to loue for Christs sake, which loue is the pure loue onely,
and the onely cause of a good conscience, for then is the conscience
pure, when the eyes looketh to Christ in all hir deedes, to
doe them for his sake, & not for hir owne singular aduauntage,
or any other wicked purpose. And Iohn both in his Gospell and
also Epistles; spoaketh neuer of any other law, then to loue one
another purely Affirming that we haue God himselfe dwelling
in vs, and all that God desireth, if we loue one another.

Much lesse spirituall Loue, which hath eyes giuen hir of God,
néedeth mans lawe to teach hir to doe hir dutie. And as in the

Lord God with all thy soule, & with all thy strength, & with all
thy minde, & thy neighbour as thy selfe: as who should say, if
thou doe this, or though canst not doe it, yet if thou féelest lust
therevnto, and thy spirit stirreth and mourneth, & longeth after
strength to doe it, take a signe & euident token thereby, that the
spirit of life is in thee, & that thou art elect to life euerlasting by
Christs bloud, whose gift and purchase is thy faith, and that spirit
that worketh the will of God in thée, whose gifte also are thy
déedes, or rather the déedes of the spirit of Christ and not thine,
and whose gifte is the reward of eternall life, which followeth

                  Why Loue hath the chiefe place, aboue

                  Now abideth Faith, Hope & Loue, but the chiefe of these is
Loue.1. Cor. 1
                           •
                        . 13 ¶The chiefe of these is Loue, not concerning iustification,
but concerning the applieng of all things to the profit of the
Congregation. Nothing letteth some one peculiar thing diuersly
referred, to be now inferiour, now superiour to another.
Loue, concerning prouiding for the necessitie of thy neighbour,
is chiefe and aboue Faith: but concerning the obtaining of iustification
and saluation, doth Faith excell Loue. Now Saint

Paule doth not héere dispute, what Faith doth in iustification,
but what loue doth to them that be needie in the Congregation,
therin is Loue chiefe, for it séeketh narrowly to see them ho

                  Of Mary Magdalens loue.
                  Many sinnes are foriuen hir,Luk. 7. 47. for she loued much, or whereby
it commeth that she loued much. ¶Neither doe we héere
wrest the words of the Gospell to maintaine a wrong opinion,
for in the history there goeth before: first, when they were not
able to pay, he forgaue them both. If he forgaue them, and if
they were not able to pay, he did not then forgiue them for their
loue. For if they had bene able to pay, he would not haue forgiuen
them. Secondly, ther goeth before: Whether of these will
loue him more? Symon saith, He to whom he forgaue him more.
Therefore, the Lords aunswere could in effect be nothing els
but this: I haue forgiuen hir very much, therefore hath she loued
me much. So then I say, loue is of forgiuenesse, and not forgiuenesse,
of loue. And then it followeth immediately: And
he said to the woman, thy faith hath saued thee, goe in peace.
                  We do therfore conclude, that there is but one onely satisfaction,
for the sins of all the world, to wit. Christ once offered vp for
vs, which are by faith made partakers of him.

                  For the loued much, that is saith Theophil
                           •
                        ct, she hath shewed
hir faith abundantly. And Basill in his sermon of Baptime,
saith: he that oweth much, hath much forgiuen him, that he may
loue much more. And therefore Christs saieng is so plaine by
the similitude, that it is a wonder to see the enimies of y• truth,
draw and racke this place so fondly, to establish their meritorious
workes. For the greater sinne a man hath forgiuen him,
the more he loueth him that hath bene so gracious vnto him.
And this woman sheweth the duties of loue, how great the benefite
was she had receiued: and therefore the Charitie that is
héere spoken off, is not to be taken for the cause, but as a signe,
For Christ saith not as the Pharesies did, that she was a sinner,
but beareth hir witnesse, that the sinnes of hir life past are
forgiuen hir.

that hir loue obtained remission of hir sinnes, but faith, out of
which hir loue procéeded: and therefore Christ openly affirmeth,
Thy Faith hath made thée safe. For (as saith Saint Paule)
without faith, it is impossible to please God. Heb. 11. 6. And
whatsoeuer is not of faith, the same is sinne. Rom. 14. 23.

lesse forgiuenesse we receiue, as by Christs example to Symon
the Pharesie of two debters, who confessed that man to loue
most, that had most forgiuen him. So it is said of Christ by
this woman (meaning Mary Magdalene) she hath loued me most
therefore most is forgiuen hir. She hath knowen hir sins most,
whereby she hath most loued me, and thou hast lesse loued me,
because thou hast lesse knowen thy sinnes: therefore, because
thou hast lesse knowen thy sinnes, thou art lesse forgiuen.

                  We may not thinke that loue causeth remission of sinnes,
but that remission of sinnes causeth loue, for that our loue followeth,
and goeth not before, Christ declareth in the same place,
saieng: He that hath much forgiuen loueth much, & to whome
lesse is forgiuen, he loueth lesse. Doth not Christ héere manifestly
teach, that Gods forgiuing engendereth in vs much loue or
little: If we examine the circumstaunce of the place, and ponder
it diligently, we shall finde it, to be none other wise. But how
shall we aunswere the phrase of Scripture, which saith that
many sinnes are forgiuen hir, because she loued much: Sommer
is high, because the trees blossome, and yet the blossoming of the
trees doth not cause Summer, but Summer causeth them to
blossome. So Winter causeth colde, and not colde Winter, & yet
we complaine on Winter, because it is so cold. So we say, the
tree is good, because the fruite is good.

                  The difference betweene Loue and Charitie.
                  There is (saith this Authour) as much difference betwéene
Loue and Charitie,Loue and Charitie. as is betwéene thred and twined thred. For
though all twined thred be thred, yet all thred is not twined
thred. So this word Loue is more common and more generall
then is Charitie. For true it is, that all Charitie is Loue:
but it is not true that all Loue is Charitie. In Gréeke, Charitie
is Agape, and loue is Eroz. There is the same difference in
the one word from ye other, that is in a pen and a quill. All our
pens for the most part be quills, but all our quills be not pens.
The quill is that remaineth in his nature, without anye other
fashion or forme put to it. The pen is a quill shaped and formed,
and made apt to write. Lykewise Loue is the common affect
or fauour: Charitie is Loue reduced into a due order towards
God and man, as to loue God alone for himselfe, & to loue man
for Gods sake, &c.

                  Of fiue manner of loues.
                  There be fiue waies noted of louing one another. Of the
which number, one way is praised, three be vtterly dispraised, &
one neither praised nor dispraised. First I may loue my neighbour
for Gods sake, as euery good vertuous man, loueth euerye
man.5. Loues. Second I may loue my neighbour of a naturall affection,
because he is my sonne, my brother or my kinsman. Thirdly, I
may loue for vaine glorie, as if I looke by my neighbour to bee
worshipped or aduaunced to honour. Fourthly, I may loue for
couetousnesse, as when I cherish or flatter a rich man for his
goods, when I make much of them that haue done me plesures,
and may doe me moe. The fifte way, I may loue for my sensuall
lust, as when I loue to fare deliciously, or els when I mad
or dote vpon women. The first way to loue my neighbour for
the loue I beare to God, is onely worthy to be praised. The second
way naturally deserueth neither praise nor dispraise. The

third, the fourth and the fift, to loue for glorie, and aduantage or
pleasure, all three be stark naught.

                  The life of S. Luke written by S. Hierome.
                  
                     LVke a Phisition & born at Antioch, was not ignorant of the
Gréeke tongue (as his writing do shew) he was a follower &
disciple of the Apostle Paule, & a companion of al his peregrination:
he wrote a volume of the Gospell, of whom ye same Paule
saith on this wise: We haue sent wt him a brother, whose praise
is in the Gospel throughout all ye Congregations. And againe to
the Collossians: Most deare Lucas the Phisition gréeteth you.
And to Timothie: Luke is with me alone. He set foorth also an
other speciall good booke, which is intitled the Actes, of the Apostles,
the storie whereof came euen full to Paules time, béeing &
tarieng two yeares at Rome, that is to say, vnto the fourth yere
of Nero the Emperour there, whereby we do wel perceiue that
the same booke was made in the same Citie. Therfore as for the
circuites of Paule & of Tecla the Uirgin, and all the tale of Leo
by him baptised, we recken among the Scriptures that be called
Apo
                           •
                        ripha. For what manner a thing is it, that a companion
which neuer went from his elbow, should among his other
matters be ignoraunt of this thing alone. Tertulian; which was
néere vnto that time, reporteth that a certaine Priest in Asia, being
an affectionate fauourer of the Apostle Paule, was conuict
before Iohn for being Author of that booke, and that the Priest

confessed himselfe to haue done the thing, for the loue that he bare
to Paule, and the booke by reason thereof, to had escaped him.
Some Writers déeme, that as often as Paule in his Epistles
saith, according to my Gospel, he signifieth of the worke of Luke.
And that Luke learned the Gospell, not onely of the Apostle
Paule (who had not bene conuersant with the Lord in the flesh)
but also of the rest of the Apostles, which thing Luke also himselfe
declareth in the beginning of his owne workes, saieng:
As they haue deliuered them vnto vs, which from the beginning
sawe them themselues with their eyes, and were Ministers of
the things that they declared. The Gospell therefore, he wrote
as he had heard: but the Actes of the Apostles he composed as he
had seene. He liued lxxxiiij. yeares not hauing any wife. Buried
he was at Constantinople, vnto which Citie his bones were remoued
& conuaied out of Achaia, together with ye bones of Andrew
the Apostle, in y• 20. yere of Constantius y• Emperour.
Eras.
                  
                  In this second booke, the blessed Euangelist S. Luke (whose
life we haue set foorth already at the beginning of his Gospell)
doth declare & write vnto vs (if we will be Theophile, that is
to say, vnfained louers of God) what was done and wrought
for our secular comfort, after the glorious Resurrection & most
triumphant Ascention of our Sauiour Iesus Christ, how that
our Lord Iesus did both promise, & also gaue most abundantly
his holy spirit vnto all his Disciples. And what this spirit did
worke by the preaching of the word, both in the Iewes, and also
in the Gentiles, that beleeued in Christ: this booke hath alwayes
bene in great estimation, and that most deseruingly. For
the Actes of the Apostles (saith S. Hierom) seeme to be but a bare
history, because in them onely the infancie of the Church (which
then began to spring) is set forth: but if we consider that Luke the
Phisition (whose praise is in ye Gospell) hath written them: we
shall also perceiue, that all his words are ye phisick of a languishing
& sick soule. What other thing (I beséech you) is this sacred
& heauenly history, but one of the chiefest parts of the Gospell.
For truly in y• other bookes (which are intitled the Gospell) the
corne of wheate are cast into the ground & discribed. But héere
in this booke, y• selfe same corne is set foorth, being already sprong
vp, and declaring most effectually his riches vnto the world. Againe,
if we had not by Luke known, after what manner Christ

forsooke the earth, where and in what place, how and after what
fashion, the promised Comforter did come, what beginning the
Church had, wherein it did flourish, by what meanes it did increase,
should we not haue lacked a great parte of the Gospell?
Therefore Bede did right well, saieng, that Luke had not onely
made an historie vntill the Resurrection and Ascention of the
Lord, as the other did, but also did so set foorth by writing the doings
of the Apostles, as much as he knew to be sufficient to edifie
the faith of the readers & hearers, that onely his booke (touching
the Actes of the Apostles) was by the Church thought good
to be credited, all other which presumed to write of the same
matter being reiected & disapproued. Chrisostome also, to them
that did meruaile why S. Luke had not written forth all the
Apostolicall historie vnto the ende, or that he had not described
the Actes of euery one of them seuerally in books by themselues,
doth aunswere godly, saieng: These are sufficient vnto them
that will apply their mindes and take héede. Therefore leauing
vnprofitable questions (why was not this written or that written)
let vs take heede vnto those wholesome saiengs of the Euangelist,
that so we may apply, this most comfortable salue
(ministred vnto vs by him) vnto our wounded soules.

                  How he was troubled with the lusts of the flesh.
                  When I was a Monke, I thought by and by that I was
vtterly cast away, if at any time I felt the lust of the flesh, that
is to saye, if I felt any euill motion, fleshly lust, wrath, hatred,
or enuie against my brother, I assaide manie wayes to helpe &
to quiet my conscience, but it wold not be: for the concupiscence
and lust of my flesh did alwaies returne, so that I coulde not
rest, but was continually vexed with these thoughts: This or
that sinne thou hast committed: Thou art infected with enuy,
with impaciencie, and such other sinnes, therefore thou art entered
in this holy order in vaine, and all thy good works are
vnprofitable. If then I had rightly vnderstood the sentences of
Saint Paule, The flesh lusteth contrary to the spirite, and the
spirit contrary to the flesh, and these two are one against another,
so that ye cannot doe the things that ye would do, I shuld
not haue so miserablye tormented my selfe, but shoulde haue
thought and sayde vnto my selfe, as now commonlye I doe:
Martin thou shalt not vtterlye be without sinne, for thou hast
flesh: thou shalt therefore féele the battell thereof, according to
that saieng of S. Paule. The flesh resisteth the spirit. Dispaire
not therefore, but resist it strongly, and fulfill not the lusts therof,
thus doing thou art not vnder the lawe, &c. Luther vpon
the Gal. fol. 251. Let all troubled consciences comfort themselues by this example of Martin Luther, and say as he sayde.
               
               
                  
                  The question that Luther put foorth a little
before his death.
                  
                     Luther a little before his death, moued this question to his
friends as they sate at supper: Whether we should know one
an other in the lyfe to come or no, and when they were al desirous
to learne of him: What saith he chaunced to Adam? He
had neuer seene Eue, but what time god shaped her, he was cast
into a meruailous dead and sound sléepe. But awaking out of
the same, when he sawe her, he asked not whence shée is, nor
whence shée came, but sayth, Shée is flesh of his flesh, and bone
of his bones. But howe knewe he that? Uerily béeing full of

Hermogenes maister of the chiualrie, was slaine of the people
when he came with the Emperours authoritie to stablish Macedonius,
whom the Arrians fauoured. And being Bishoppe of
Constantinople, he practised extreame crueltie in the Church,
constraining the Christians to receiue the Communion with
the Arrians, in such wise that if women or children refused to
doe the same, he did either cut off their paps, or by such other
cruell torments, force them therevnto. He caused much tumult

from the Gréeke word Menisos, which signifieth greatest. But
whether that Maister come of the Aduerbe Magis, either of the
Greeke word Mènisos, euerie way, Magistrates do represent y•
authoritie & office of Maisters. And we be also therby enformed
that it were méete for them which doe rule others to aduance
and passe them whome they do rule, in the prerogatiue of wisdome
and authoritie.

                  As the true Church doth acknowledge the ministers of the
Gospell, as the true ministers of God, ordeined by him, for the
administration of spirituall things: euen so doe shee knowledge
the Magistrates as ministers of his iustice ordeined of him for
the confirmation of the publike peace, and therefore she doth
willingly submit her self to them in all things for God. For she
knoweth verie well, that God would that euerie man should
be subiect vnto them in all things, which are of their charge.
                  And that they which doe resist the same, resist the ordinance of
God, and do set vp themselues against him. Ro. 13. 1. 1. Pet. 2. 13.

                  How the Ecclesiasticall person is subiect to
the ciuill Magistrate.
                  It perteineth to ecclesiasticall persons to iudge in spirituall
causes, but if anie of them swarue from the right rule of iustice,
he is subiect to the correction and punishment of the ciuill
magistrate.Exo. 32. 21 As Aaron had his authoritie of iudgement in spiritual
causes,3. Re. 2. 35 yet was he reproued by Moses. And the high Priest
was deposed by Salomon,
                     4. Re. 16. 16 and Sadoc set in his place. And so
shuld Ahas, if he had ben a goodly prince, haue deposed Vriah, for

                  How Magistrates that doe not perswade the people
to Gods worde, are not to be obeied
in cause of conscience.
                  The. xxi. Princes that were sent to explorate and search the
priuitie and conditions of the land of Canaan, two of them perswaded
the people to beleeue Gods promises, and not to feare
the people that dwell in the lande. Unto these godlye Princes

was no faith nor eredence giuen of the people. The Princes
that perswaded the thing contrarie vnto God, were beleeued of
the people and their counsell admitted. By this we learne that
such Magistrates as perswade the people to Gods word, should
be beléeued and obeied, the other not, in cause of conscience, ther
must God onely be heard. Act. 5 29. Math. 10. 28. Or els people
shall faile of a right faith. For he that knoweth not what his
duetie is to God and his lawes, will beléeue rather a lye with
his fore-fathers, then the truth with y• worde of God. And this

               MAHOMET.
               
                  Of the rising vp of this false Prophet.
                  
                     MAhomet of Arabia (as most men saye) of the mother side
descended from Abraham by the linage of Ismael his son,
which he had by Agar his seruaunt, which was a Iew, béeing
fatherlesse and motherlesse. He was (by the Scenites) solde to
a great rich Merchaunt, who loued him so greatly for his fauour
and wit, that he made him ruler of all his merchaundise
and businesse, and was verie diligent in his maisters affayres,
and gained much by occupieng with the Iewes & Christians,
and in vsing their company, learned many things both of ye one
lawe and of the other. His Maister chaunced to dye without
heyre, leauing his wise verie rich, who being about the age of
50. yeares, liked the younge man Mahomet so well, that shée
tooke him to husband, and made him of a poore man very rich.
At the same time it chaunced a Monke named Sergius, a man
of verie euill nature, and verie subtile (who fled Constantinople for heresie) to fall into familiaritie with Mahomet, by
whose instruction he increased so in Magicall arte, that by his
counsell and aide, hée tooke vppon him to make the people beléeue
that he was a Prophet, and shewing some points of Magike,

he first perswaded his wife and his householde. He had also
an infirmitie called the falling sicknesse. And when his wife
(being sore afraide thereof) would aske him what it was, hée
made her beléeue that it was the Angell of God, which came
oftentimes to speake vnto him, and forasmuch as he coulde not
abide (as man) the diuine presence, he fell into such agonie and
alteration of spirit. After this his wife died and left him meruailous
riches, who then, what for the riches & y• constāt report
that went on Mahomet the Prophet, he became in greate reputation
amonge the Gentiles. And so by the counsell of Sergius,
he called himselfe the greate Prophet of God, and shortly
after when his name was published and of great authoritie,
he deuised a lawe or kinde of religion called Alcaron. In the
which he toke some part well neere of all the heresies that
had ben before his time. With the Sabellians he diuided the
trinitie: with y• 
                     Maniches he affirmed to be but two persōs in ye
deitie: he denied the equalitie of the father & the son, with E

Angell Gabriel appeared vnto him, whose brightnesse he could
not behold. He was buried at Medina, thrée daies iourney from

                  Of mans good purpose before grace.
                  A reason of the Pelagians & Dunce men, of mans good purpose

before grace. The grace of God (say they) doth helpe mans
good purpose, so that man doth first intend and purpose well,
& as Dunce saith, dispose himselfe by attrition to receiue grace,
and then God doth helpe him.
               
               
                  Aunswere.
                  Of truth; there is no good purpose in man,Mans purpose. no good disposition,
nor good intent, but all is against goodnesse, and cleane contrarie
against all things that agréeth with grace, till that God of
his méere mercy commeth and giueth him a will to will goodnesse,
yea, and that when he thought nothing of goodnesse, but
doth cleerely resist all goodnesse. This doth S. Austen
                     Augustin proue in
these words: The Pelagians say, that they graunt how ye grace
doth helpe euery mans good purpose, but not that he giueth that
loue of vertue to him that striueth against it. This thing doe
they say, as though man of himselfe, without the helpe of God
hath a good purpose and a good minde to vertue, by the which
merit proceeding before, he is worthy to be holpen of the grace
of God that followeth after. Doubtlesse the grace that followeth
doth helpe the good purpose of man, but the good purpose
should neuer haue bene, if grace had not preceded. And though
that the good studie of men when it beginneth is holpen of grace,
yet it did neuer begin without grace. ¶Héere we sée S Austen

                  There be some orders in ye primitiue Church commaunded
by God, & some other were deuised by men, for y• better training
of the people.Mans ordinaunce. Such orders as were cōmanded by God, may in
no wise be chaunged, onely because God commaunded them: for
as God is euerlasting, so is his word & commaundement euerlasting.
On the other side such order as haue bene deuised by
men, may be broken vpon some good consideration, only because
they were men that deuised them. For as they be mortall, so all
their wisdome and inuentions be but mortall. And so indéed as
touching such things as haue ben ordeined by men, we are not
bound of necessitie to the order of the primitiue Church. But
such things as God hath precisely cōmanded by his word, may
neuer be broken, by any custome or consent.

iustification vnto the grace and mercie of God, & part of it vnto
the same will and running,Mans wil & running. or indeauour of man. S. Austen
maketh answere thus: If (saith he) the Apostle did meane none
other thing, but that it doth not onely lye in the will and running
of man, except the mercy of God doe helpe, we may also
say on the contrary, that it lyeth not only in the mercy of God
without the will and running of man: but sith it were a plaine
vngodlynesse to saye so, let vs not doubt but y• the Apostle did
attribute all to y• mercy of God, & that he did leaue no manner
of thing vnto our owne will & endeuour. Againe he saith in an
other place: Therefore that we should beléeue in God & liue
godly, it lyeth not in the will and running of man, but in the
mercy of God, not that we ought not both to will & runne, but
because that he himselfe doth worke in vs, both to wil and also
to runne.

                  Of two Hebrew words that signifie man.
                  A man sent from God.Iohn. 1. 6. ¶The Hebrewes haue two words
to signifie man, Adam and Ish. Adam signifieth a man subiect
to mortalitie, miserie, and calamitie. Ish, signifieth a man of
reputation. The Prophet Dauid comprehendeth both in one
verse in the Psal. Heare this all ye people, &c. B

to heauen, he is not bent downeward to the ground, after
the manner of other beasts, which thing the Greeks noted by
the name of a man, calling him Anthropos, an vp looker. They
haue also another word Aner In the holy scripture written in
Gréeke, this worde Anthropos, signifieth a man compassed wt
misery: for in the tenth of the Acts, when Cornelius worshipped
Peter, he sayd vnto him, arise, I also am Anthropos a mortall

                  The first man was of the earth earthly, the second man is
the Lord from heauen.1. Co. 15. 47 ¶S. Paules purpose in this place, is not
to speake of the substance of our bodies, or of y• substance of the
Lords bodie, but of ye qualities, as the words following declare.
Hoios. Of what qualitie y• earthly, of y• qualitie are ye earthly,
& of what qualitie the heauenly is, of that qualitie are the
heauenly. This then is the sense. The first man was of y• earth
earthly, that is subiect to sinne, and corrupt affections, which
bring death. The second heauenly, that is, full of heauenly qualities,
which through the power of Gods spirit, draweth them
lyfe and immortalitie. As we beare the Images of the earthly, y•
is, were sinfull, and therefore compassed with death, so shal we
beare the Image of the heauenly, that is, our spirites shall bée
renued to true holynesse, & our bodyes to immortalitie. Wherfore
when he saith the second man is the Lord from heauen, hée
meaneth not that he brought his body from heauen, but that he
is heauenly, as he expoundeth himselfe, that he is endued with
heauenly qualyties.

as innocencie, immortalitie, & the Image of God: & not onely
in daunger of temporall, but euerlasting death, from which wee
could neuer deliuer our selues. The priest & Leuit ministers of
the law (by whom y• law is signified) passed by, they ne could ne
would help the afflicted. They loked vpon him, they saw, & that
was all, for the law sheweth & reuealeth our misery, reléeueth
it not. The Samaritane (in whom our sauiour Christ & the christian
righteousnesse cōming by him is signified) powreth Oyle
into his wounds, bindeth them vp, & carrieth him to the Inne,

                     Heretike. he was a Persian
borne, in manners rude and barbarous, and of a fierce
and cruel nature, and without all modestie, he endeauoured to
perswade the people that he represented the forme of Christ.
Sometime he sayde that he was Paraclitus, that is, the
true comforter that was promised by Christ. His followers denied
Christ to haue taken very flesh. They reiected also the old
Testament, and part of the new.

                      in Persia, was the beginner of them. This
same spread his venim abrode largely. First by y• 
                     Arabians: afterward
in Affrica, which went to spéedely on, y• it could not be
swaged the space of two hundred yeares afterward. The chiefe
of their doctrine was, y• ther wer two Gods, ye one good, ye other
euill, & both like euerlasting. This doctrine seemed vnto mans
reason allowable. For séeing God is good by nature, & that in
the meane season the euill hath such power: it is necessary ther
be also a peculiar God, which is authour & doer of euils, equal
to the other God with power & euerlastingnes. Beside these,
had they other opinions ye they taught, namely, y• Christ was no
true God, neither receiued they the bookes of the Apostles, but
fained their seueral doctrines, y• which they called Christs gospel
also: They bosted also of seueral illuminatiōs of heauen, & said,
they gaue the holy Ghost. They ordeined sundrye ceremonies:
They vsed also choise of meates: They forbad wedlocke, saieng,
that thereby is obteyned the holy Ghost. They taught also
to reiect ciuill power. For Matrimonye and gouernaunce
of Common wealth, they sayde to haue their ofspring from
the euill God, and not to be ordeined of the good God.

72. faith) Electos,
                     The Papists and Maniches agree in these pointes. they ministred the holy mysteries vnder one
kind. They yelded more credit to their own deuises, thē to Gods
holy word. They say the scriptures are falsified & ful of errors.

They abstaine from flesh, & yet in their fast, they had and vsed
all manner delicates and straunge fruits, with sundry sorts of
spices in great abundaunce. They abstained from wine, and
yet vsed other lyquors more daintie & precious then any wine,
and thereof dranke while their bellies would hold.
                  
                     Manes the Hereticke, whereof the Maniches haue their appellation,
had his originall in Persia (as Epiph. haeres. 66. writeth)
about the. 4. yeare of Aurelianus. He called himselfe Christ
and the comforter. He chose vnto himselfe. xij. Apostles. He said
that Christ was not truly borne, but phantastically. Euseb. li. 7.

called Cubricus. Afterward chaunging his name, he went into
Persia, found the bookes of Buddas, and published them in his
owne name. He taught that there were many Gods, that the
Sunne was to be worshipped, that there was fatall destenie,
that the soules went from one body into another. The king of
Persia sonne fell sicke. Manes through Sorcerie tooke vpon him
to cure him and killed him.His death & vvretched end. The King caused him to be clapt in

confuteth the Maniches and such like Heretikes, which denied
the truth of the humaine nature of Christ, saieng that his bodye
was not a true body, but a phantasticall bodie. Thus they reasoned
to vphold their errours: It pertaineth not to a true bodie
to walke on the Sea, but Christ walked vpon the Sea, therfore
he had no true nor reall bodie but a phantasticall bodie.
                  These men consider nothing more to be in Christ, then in a bare
man, as though it were impossible for God to helpe an humaine
bodie from sinking in the Sea. But what saye they vnto
this, y• 
                     Peter at the commaundement of Christ, walked vpon
the Sea. Why do they not consider that he which caused Peter
to walke vpon the Sea with an humaine body, can much more
easely himselfe doe the like. They should weigh the power of
Christ, if not in his owne déede, yet at the least, by the deede
of Peter.

himselfe is that true bread, because he féedeth vnto the true and

Manna spirituall foode, it maketh nothing against this place, for
he ioyneth the thing signified with the signes, but in this whole
disputation, Christ dealeth with the Iewes, after their owne
opinion and conceipt of the matter, and they haue no further
consideration of the Manna, but that it fed the belly.

                  Of those that eate Manna and are dead.
                  Your Fathers did eate Manna in the Wildernesse,Iohn. 6. 49 and are
dead. ¶This verse is two waies expounded. Some vnderstand
it generally of all those fathers of the Iewes, which did
eate Manna in Moses time in the Desart, as well godly as vngodly:
insomuch that the Lord speaketh héere in this place, not
of the death of the soule, but of the body. But other some expoūd
it of the wicked onely, which did eate Manna without faith of
the truth, in the which is life, and therefore are also dead, that
is to say, they perished euerlastingly: but it séemeth not necessary,
that we heere distinguish betwéene the beléeuing & the vnbeléeuing Iewes. Onely Christ saith y• 
                     Manna was a corruptible
meate to the Fathers, being foode not of the soule, but of the

body, not sempiternall but temporall, which could not saue them
from death. It followeth therefore, that mens soule finde foode
no where, but in him whereby they may be fed into euerlasting
life, for we must remember what was spoken in another place,
that there is no mention made heere of Manna as Christ was
a secret figure (for in that respect Paule calleth him spirituall
meate) but héere Christ frameth his speach to his hearers,1. Cor. 10. 3 who
beeing onely carefull for the feeding of their bellyes, had no farther
consideration of any thing in Manna. He doeth therefore
iustly pronounce that their fathers are dead, that is to say, which
were in like manner addict to their bellyes.

                  To him that ouercommeth will I giue to eate Manna that
is hid,Apo. 2. 17. and will giue to him a white stone, &c. ¶By Manna
vnderstande the word of God, and true heartie loue: by the
white stone is signified the election before God, and also euerlasting
peace and confidence in the grace and fauour of God, vnto
euerlasting life.

                  How Manna & the water brought out of the
Rocke, is compared to our bread and
wine in the Sacrament.
                  The Manna which God sent downe from heauen, to féede
the people of Israel in the wildernesse, and the water which he
brought out of the stone to refresh and comfort them, were euen
the same things vnto them, that bread & wine is now vnto vs.
For as S. Austen saith, as many as in that Manna vnderstoode
Christ, did eate the same spirituall meate that we doe. But as
many as sought onely to fill their bellies of that Manna (the
fathers of the vnfaithfull) did eate, & are dead. And likewise the
same drinke, for the stone was Christ. Héere may we gather of
S. Austen that the Manna was vnto them, 
                        〈…〉
                      the bread is vnto
vs. And likewise that the water was to them, as the wine is
to vs: which thing appeareth more plaine by the words of Saint
Austen following, which be these: Manducauit Moses Manna,
&c. Moses did also eate Manna, & Aaron & Phinehes did eate of
it, which pleased God & are dead, wherfore, because they vnderstood
y• visible meat spiritualy. They wer spiritualy an hūgred,
they tasted it spiritualy, y• they might be spiritualy replenished.

They did all eate the same spirituall meate, and all dranke the
same spiritually which we doe, and they all did drinke the same
spirituall drinke. They dranke one thing and we another, but
that was in the outward appearaunce, which neuerthelesse did
signifie the same thing spiritually. How dranke they the same
drinke? They (saith the Apostle) dranke of the spirituall stone
following them, and that stone was Christ. And thereto Saint
Bede addeth these words: Videte autem fide manente, signa
variata: Behold, that the signes are altered, and yet the faith
abideth one. Of these places it may plainely be perceiued, that
it is no Article necessary to be beleeued vnder paine of damnation,
that the Sacrament should be the naturalll body of Christ,
seeing the olde fathers neuer beleeued it. And as they were saued
without beleeuing that Manna was altered into Christes
body: euen so shall we be saued without beleeuing that the substaunce
of bread is turned into his naturally body, for the same
faith shall saue vs, that saued them. And we are bound to beléeue
no more vnder paine of damnation, then they wer bound
to beleeue.

words is betokened the seuerest kinde of cursse and excommunication
that was among the Iewes, and the words are as
much to say, as our Lord commeth. So that his meaning maye
be this, Let him be accursed euen to the comming of the Lord,
that is to say, to his deaths daye, euen for euer.
                  S. Hierome doth expound this word Maranatha, the Lord
commeth, as if he should say: If a man doe not beleeue our Lord
Iesus Christ, let him be accursed: and let him be sure that the
the Lord (against whō no hatred can preuaile) doth come. Some
againe doe expound it thus: Let him be as a rotten member
cut off, and perish vtterly.

                  Of the damnable heresies of this man.
                  
                     
                     MArcion of Pontus encreased the doctrine of Cerdon. He liued
in the time of Iustinus Martir,
                     Heretike. which wrote a booke against
him. He met Policarpus and asked of him: Knowest thou
vs? Policarpus: I knowe thée for the first begotten of Satan.
Euseb. li. 4. cap. 11. 14. He said, the soule onely should bée saued,
and not the body. He thought that Cain with the Sodomites & Aegyptians, &c. were saued when Christ went downe to Hell.
Irenaeus li. 1. ca. 29. Epiph. haeres. 42. writeth of him, that he was
a Bishops sonne, who when he had de
                        ••
                     oured a Uirgin, was by
his own father excommunicated the church, & afterward he fled
to Rome. Being there, because they admitted him not into the
Church, he began to preach detestable doctrine: That there
were three beginnings, good, iust and euill. That the new Testament
was contrarye to the olde. He denied the resurrection
of the body.
               
               
                  A comparison betweene the Marcions
doctrine, and the Popes.
                  The Marcions receiued no man to be a Christen man, except
he would refuse mariage. The Pope receiueth no Priests, except
they fors weare mariage. So that there is no diuersitie betwéene
these heretikes and the Pope, but that these Heretikes
doth except a greater number then the Pope doth, and speaketh
more generally, but the thing is all one. For the Marcionites
indgeth mariage vncleane for their sort, and so doth the Pope for
his sort. Farther more Marcion saith, that among christen men
may be no temporall mariage, but all conjunction must be turned
into a spirituall mariage. And the selfe same thing saith the
Pope of his Priests, wherfore seeing y• they do graunt how that
S. Paule and also holy Fathers hath condemned this heresie of
the Marcionites, it must néedes followe that the opinion of the
Pope is likewise damned. But héere will some obiect and say
(as Eckius hath written) that the Pope doth not condemne mariage,
but he causeth men alonely to keep his vowe. Aunswere.
First the Pope compelleth them and if they will be Priests, to
vowe & fors weare mariage. For if ther wer no statute made afore
of ye Pope, y• all Priests, shuld fors weare mariage, thē shuld
ther no vowes he made of priests against mariage, but the thing
shuld be frée. So y• the vowe commeth out of the Popes decrée &
prohibition, & not the decrée out of the vowe. Ergo, the prohibition

goeth before the vowe, wherefore this euation can haue no
place. Example. The Emperour maketh a statute, that
no man shall be admitted into his seruice, except he first sweare
to be an enimie vnto the Kings grace of England. Is not now
the Emperour first an enimie vnto the Kings person, and then
also a forbidder of loue and fauour towards the Kings grace of
England? I thinke his grace will take his acte none otherwise.
For though he doe not nor cannot make all men the Kings enimies,
yet he maketh all that appertaine vnto him, to be ye kings
enimies. So likewise the Pope, though he doe not forbidde all
men mariage, yet he forbiddeth as many as will be Priests, yea,
and he will admit no man to be Priest, except he first forswears
mariage. So that the vowe is first made, or the Priesthood bée
giuen.

                     Marcion and Montanus, two ranke Heretikes, anone after
the Apostles daies sprong vp, and fained such a chaste holinesse
of life, that they forbad and damned mariage. But Epiphanius
writeth, that Marcion when he was receiued as a guest in the
house of a certaine Deacon in Cipres, he caried away his Hosts
wife, deceiued with his holy pretence of his new chast religion.
And when Doctor Marcion had taken his pleasure of hir, and
cast hir vp, the miserable woman constrained to returne to hir
husband, lamenting hir fault, asked him forgiuenesse. This
carefull woman (saith Epiphanius) was afterward a good warning
for many other women, monishing them to beware of Bishop
Marcion his doctrine. This Marcion and Montanus were
the onely beginners of the lawe of wiuelesse and husbandlesse
chastitie, and the first authours and patrons of the Monkes religion
Melancthon.

                  How Mary the mother of Christ, ought
not to be worshipped.
                  CHrist (saith Epiphanius) did forme a fashion, himselfe of the
Uirgin Mary, as of the earth, who came downe from heauen,
and being both God and the word, did put on flesh of the
Uirgin, but not that the Uirgin should be worshipped, or that
he would make hir a God, or that we should offer in hir name.
For he neither did suffer hir to giue or minister Baptime, nor
to blesse the Apostles, neither did he commaund hir to beare
rule in the earth, but will haue vs to know, that he alone is the
sanctification and that she is made worthy of the kingdome of
heauen. Whence doth this rolling Serpent or Dragon come
vnto vs? Whence are these lewd and wicked councells renued?
Let Mary be in honour, let the Father, the Sonne and the holy
Ghost be worshipped, let no man worship Mary. And by &
by after, Let no man eate of the errour which is of the holy
Mary. Although it be a goodly trée, yet is it not for meate to be
eaten of: Although Mary be most beautiful, holy & honourable,
yet she is not appointed to be worshipped, let therfore the error,
of ye deceiued cease. For neither is Mary a God, neither hath she
a body from heauen, but of the conception of man & woman,
howbeit disposed, according to y• promise, as y• cōception & birth of
Isaac was. And let no man offer in hir name, for he that doth it,
doth cast away his soule. Againe, let no man raile against hir,
nor blaspheme y• holy Uirgin, God forbid, for she was not coupled
to man, neither after the birth, nor before the birth of our
Sauiour: Againe in y• same booke Contra Colicidianos, these
are also his words: Indéed the virgin was a virgin & honorable,
but not giuen to vs to be worshipped, but rather she doth worship
him y• tooke his substaunce of hir, that is to say, of hir flesh.

                  It was that Mary that anoynted the Lord with oyntment.Iohn. 1. 2
¶Because the Gospell maketh mention of many Maries, héere
there is a difference put, betwéene this Mary & the rest, namely,
that it was the very same which anoynted the Lord. And this
is put downe héere by anticipation. For the Euangelist declareth
this anoynting in the Chapter following. Therefore there
is a great ignoraunce in them, which imagine this Mary the sister
of Lazarus, to be that infamous woman of whome Luke
maketh mention in his 7. Chapter. The making mention of
the oyntment, occasioned this error, and also because in both places,
mention is made of Symon, in whose house it was done:
as though it were not manifest that Christ was oftentimes annointed,
& that in diuers places. The sinfull woman of whome
Luke speaketh of, anoynted Christ in Ierusalem, wher she dwelt.
And Mary of Betany did the like in hir towne. And the preter
tense (anoynted) which the Euangelist vseth, ought not to be referre
                        •
                     
to the time in the which the same was done, but to the
time in which he wrote: as if he should say
                        •
                      This is that Mary
which afterward powred out hir oyntment, for the which
cause there arose a murmuring among the Disciples, &c.

                  Concerning Mariage, we say that it ordeined of: God, and
honourable in all estates, as the holy Scripture teacheth. So
that whosoeuer hath not the gift of continencie, that is to say,
who that feeleth in himselfe, such a naturall desire; that he may

                  Wedlocke (or mariage) is a perpetuall ioyning together of
one man wt one woman, instituted of God to bring forth fruit,
and is ordained to auoid lusts forbidden in the scripture. They
shall be two in one flesh, that is to say to please God ye Creator,

of nature, to obaie his ordinaunce in that vocation, the man not
to despise the womankinde, but to hono

man should know his owne vessell, as the part and parent
of mankinde, to defend hir, to helpe hir, and to loue hir. Both
bringing foorth children, teaching them the true knowledge of
God, that this knowledge of God might be set foorth more plenteously,
and be conserued vpon earth.
                  For this cause also ought wedlocke to be vsed, that when
men be departed from this societie, euery mans dutie is for
himselfe gone, to leaue after him by iust wedlocke, other worshippers
of God in his place vpon earth. For this intent Abraham,
Isaac, and many ancient olde holy Bishops, desired to haue
children, that they might leaue after them, the faithfull kéepers
of the heauenly doctrine.

                  Matrimonie or wedlocke, is a state or a degrée ordeined of
God, and an office wherein the husband serueth the wife, & the
wife the husband. It was ordeined for a remedie to increase the
world, and for the man to helpe the woman, & the woman the
man, with all loue and kindnesse, & not to signifie any promise,
that euer I haue heard or read off in the scripture. Therefore
ought it not to be called a Sacrament. It hath a promise, that
we sinne not in that state,Matrimonie is no sacramāt if a man receiue his wife, as a gifte,
giuen him of God, and the wife hir husband like wise: as all
manner of meates and drinkes haue a promise, that we sinne
not, if we vse them measurably with thanks-giuing. It they cal
Matrimonie a Sacrament, because the scripture vseth the similitude
of matrimonie to expresse the mariage or wedlocke y• is
betwéene vs and Christ (for as a woman though she be neuer so
poore, yet when she is maried, is as rich as hir husband: euen
so we when we repent & beleeue the promises of God in Christ,
though we be neuer so poore sinners, yet are as rich as Christ, all
his merits are ours with all that he hath) If for that cause they
call it a Sacrament: so will I mustard seed,

be sanctified with an whore, then to come within the sanctuary.

                  Let euery man for auoyding of fornication haue his wife,1. Cor. 7. 2
and euery woman haue hir husband. ¶Héere S. Paule commaundeth,
that where as any daunger of fornication is, y• euery
man, in auoiding of vicious lyuing should take a wife, héere is
no man excepted, for the text saith, euery man, and specially to
them that cannot liue sole. The occasion that S. Paule had to
write this text to the Corinthians, there were certaine men among
them, that reckoned it an holinesse and a perfection (as
certaine men do now for Priests) that Christen men should liue
sole without wiues, as the text declareth, it is good for a man not
to touch a woman. To this their holy hypocrisie S. Paule doth
aunswere in this manner: To auoyd fornication (saith he) let
euery man marrie a wife: marke, how he biddeth them to marrie,
he biddeth them not to fast, nor to labour, nor yet to weare
haire to chasten their bodyes, but alonely to marry. As who
should saye, God had ordained and approued a lawfull and
lawdable remedie, for euery man that had not the gifte of chastitie.

                  Against condemners of marriage.
                  The spirit speaketh euidently that in the latter times,1. Tim. 4. 1 some
shall depart from the faith, and shall giue héede vnto spirites of
errour, and doctrines of diuells, which speake false through hypocrisie,
and haue their conscience burned with an hot yron, forbidding
to marry, &c. ¶S. Paule hauing the spirite of God, did
prophecie, that there should come men in the latter dayes which
should forbid mariage, and these men shall speake lyes through
hyprocrisie. Now marke the text, Men shall forbid mariage, and
that in the latter daies. The truth is, that no man hath forbidden
any certaine state of men to marrie, but the Pope onely,
wherefore this text must néedes touch his kingdome, seeing that
he is also in the latter dayes. There were certaine Heretikes
called Taciani, which did condemne fully and wholy all manner
of marriage. And though S. Paule speaketh against them, yet in
very deede the Popes doctrine is not excepted, séeing it is contained
in these latter dayes. For though there were twentie
heresies more then 
                        
                           •
                        aciam, yet must the text be applied against
them all, that doth condemne or els dispise marriage in ye whole

or in part, for the text is against them all that doth condemne
marriage, specially in the latter daies. But he that doth forbid
his Priests to marry, doth forsomuch forbid marriage: Ergo,
the texte is against the Pope. Note also, that these men which
forbid marriage, shall haue an holy colour of hypocrisie. Now
hath the Pope forbidden the Priests to marry, vnder the coulour
of holynesse, because (as he saith) his Priests must be pure
and cleane. As who should saye, that marriage were vncleane
and vnpure for Priests to vse. What can be holy hypocrisie, if
this be not hypocrisie. Heere is the holy and pure institution of
God condemned as a thing vncleane for his Priests to vse.
                  Moreouer, the Tacians did not forbid marriage vnder the coulour
of holinesse, but they said it was fully and wholly an vnlawfull
thing: the which doctrine had no manner of colour. But
the Pope saith, Mariage is good and laudable in it selfe, but his
Priests be too pure and too holy, for to vse that simple thing, for
it is not a thing (saith he) that doeth become the state of perfect
men, but it belongeth to weake and vnperfect men. Now iudge
whether the Taciani or the Papiani doth pretend the greatest
colour of holinesse.
                  Heretikes (saith S. Hierome
                     Hierome li. 1. Ose. 9) and all such as pretend that
they loue chastitie, doe very seldome loue it indéede, as Manicheus,

They promise honny with a poysoned mouth, but according to
the saieng of the Apostle, It is a filthy thing to vtter what they
doe in secret. Eph. 5. 12. ¶Saint Hierome in this place inueigheth
against the old heretiks, which wold not marrie themselues
nor allow marriage in other, but pretended such a hollinesse
with a shewe of virginitie and hatred of marriage, that with
their holy lookes and swéete wordes they deceiued the people.

thy Lorde was at the marriage feast, be honoured marriage
with his presence, And yet doest thou blame marriage?
And saist thou that marriage is an hinderance vnto godlines,
I tell thee marriage is no manner hinderance vnto godlinesse.

Wilt thou know that it hindereth not to haue wife & children?
Had not Moses wife and children? Behold Peter a piller of the
Church, he had a wife, therefore finde no fault with marriage.
Againe, writing vpon the words of the Prophet Esay, Vidi dominum,
&c. He sayth: who speaketh these words: Esaias the beholder
of the celestial Seraphins. Who not withstanding he had
company with his wife, yet he quenched not the grace of God.
Againe, Esay had a sonne and a wife: that thou maist vnderstand
that marriage is not euill, but that fornication is ill. Againe,
what did marriage hinder thee? No, thy wife is giuen thee to be
thy helper, and not to deceiue thée.

                  For this is the will of God,1. The. 4. 3 euen that ye should be holy, and
that ye should absteine from fornication, that euery one of you
should knowe to kéepe his own vessell in holynesse and honour.
¶Héere Saint Paule saith, that it is the wil of God that euery
man should abhorre fornication: who will then resist the wil
of God,Priests marriage. and not regard the thing that God will haue done.
                  Furthermore, the will of God is (sayth S. Paule) y• euery man
should kéepe his vessell in honour. Now if Priestes be men, &
haue not the gift of chastitie, then are they bound to regard this
commaundement, for he saith, euery man. Marke how S. Paule
also calleth the vessell of married men honourable, & sanctified,
wherefore then shuld it be vnlawfull for a Priest, to vse a sanctified
and an holy vessell. How can man now for anie occasion
curse that thing that God hath sanctified, or make it vncleane
that God hath purified, but Saint paule prophesied of such men.

well as other Apostles, & as the brethren of the Lord and Cephas.
¶This text doth cleerly proue that Peter & other Apostles
had wiues, And wherefore then shoulde it be vnlawfull for
Priests to marrie, they are no better nor no holyer then the Apostles
were. But heere will some say, that the Apostles hadde
wiues, before that Christ did choose them, but afterwarde they
forsooke their wiues and followed Christ, which thinge is not
true that they forsooke their wiues, for that hadde beene
plainely against the doctrine of their Maister CHRIST,

which taught them not to forsake their wiues, but in any wise
to kéepe them, sauing alonely for fornication. And this place of
S Paule, Haue we not power, &c. doth proue how S. Peter after
his Apostleshippe, and also other disciples of Christ, caried their
wiues about with them, when they went a preaching. Wherefore
it is a false lye to say that they had forsaken their wiues.

Confessour (being vnmaried himselfe) did withstand them, and
saide that their mariage was honourable, and it was pure
chastitie for them to lye with their wiues, so that the Councell
was perswaded not to make any such lawe, affirming it to
be a grieuous occasion both vnto them & also vnto their wiues,
of fornication. The Councell did allowe this sentence, so that
nothing was decreed, as concerning this thing, but euery man
was left vnto his free-will, and not bound of any necessitie.

Priests might lawfully marrie wiues, insomuch that Anselme
then Archbishop of Canterbury in a Seane that he helde at

                  It is better (saith Epiphanius
                     Epip. con. Atheos heresy.) for him that is fallen in his
course (meaning them that cannot continue in ye thing that they
haue vowed) to take a wife openly according to the lawe, and
so to be restored into the Church againe (as one that before hath
done euill, and as one that hath fallen and hath bene broken,
and hath now néede to be bound) and not daily to be inwardly
wounded by secret dartes, wherewith the Diuell continually
doth assault them. ¶Loe, héere Epiphanius doth not onely
allowe marriage of Priests & Uotaries before priesthood and
vowing, but also after priesthood & vowing, & nameth marriage
done in such case lawfull, & that marriage after their vowe so
broken, is a meane to restore them againe to the Church, if they
were fallen from it by breking their vowe. So that you sée by Epiphanius
iudgment, y• the marriage of priests euen after their
vowe, is not onely a marriage, but also a lawfull marriage.
                  Wherefore they that say the marriage of such (meaning of
them that marrie after they haue vowed) is no marriage but
rather adulterie,Augustin me séemeth they doe not aduisedlye inough
consider what they say, for they be deceiued by an appearaunce
of truth, for by the meanes of that foolish opinion whereby they
thinke the marriage of such professed women as haue forsaken

their vowe is no marriage if they marrye, there commeth no
small inconuenience, which inconuenience is this, wiues bée
seperated from their husbands, as though they were whores,
and not wiues. And when they will restore the diuorsed to sole
life, their husbandes are compelled to be verye adulterers,
when their owne wiues beeing alyue, they marrye other
husbands.

we haue of Saint Paule, wherevnto I adde this Minor or
meane proposition. But marriage is a creature of God, that I
am sure you cannot denie, vnlesse ye will saye marriage is a
creature of the Diuell, as the olde Heretikes Saturnius, Basilides,

Ergo mariage is good and not to be refused, béeing taken
with thankes-giuing, for it is sanctified by the worde of God
and prayer. This sounde Silogismus prooueth plainely that the
marriage of a Priest, is not onely a marriage, but also a good
marriage, and a good thing, for it is sanctified by the word of God
and prayer.

forbiddeth marriage to be dissolued. To the which (saith Melancthon)

against Matrimonie. If there were then (saith Melancthon) so
great foolsh ignoraunce in the man, as to thinke wedlocke reuiled
and dampned by this text: surely Sircius had ben more méet
to haue rowed in a gally, or to haue holden the plough, then to
haue had that seate, therein to sit and gouerne the Church of
Christ.To liue after the flesh, what it is. Or else if he did so mocke out this thing wittinglye, his
shamelesse rescription is more worthy to be abhorred & hated,
then his fond ignoraunce. For to liue after the flesh, is to fall
against the commaundements of God, and not to signifie the
honest vse of chast wedlocke, or lawfully to vse meat & drinke,
according to Gods precept.

this vsage among them, that none was suffred to haue fire
in his house, but those y• were married, for the custodie of Gods
(sayd they) might be cōmitted to none but married & auncient
folkes. And this was their order in marriage. The daye when
anie person should be married,Marriage of the Chaldeās the Priest came into the house
to light new fire, the which neuer ought to be put out vntill
the houre of his death. And if perchaunce during the lyfe of
the husband and of the wife, they should finde the fire dead and
put out, the marriage betwéene them was dead and vndone,
yea, though they had bene xl. years married. And of this occasion
came the Prouerbe, which of many is read, and of few vnderstood,
that is to wit, Prouoke me not too much, that I throw
water into the fire. The Chaldeans vsed such words when they
wold diuorse or seperate the marriage. For if the woman were
ill contented with her husband, in casting a little water on the
fire, immediatly she might marry with an other. And if the
husband like did put out the fire, he might with an other woman
contract marriage. I pray God there be none(at this day)
among the Christians, that wold be content to put out the fire,
and to cast out the ashes and all to be at libertie.

maketh mention. And Peter in his first Epistle, where vnder
the name of Babilon by a figuratiue manner of speaking, hée

vnderstandeth Rome. The congregation of them which at Babilon
are companions of your election, saluteth you, and so doth
Marke my sonne. Wherefore he tooke the Gospell that he himselfe
had written, and went into Aegypt, and first of all men
preached Christ at Alexandria, where hée ordeined a Church
or congregation of such pure doctrine and perfect liuing, that
he made all that professed Christ to followe his example. To
be short, philo the eloquentest writer of y• Iews, perceiuing the
first congregation of Alexandria, yet to perseuer in the Iewish
religion, wrote a booke of their conuersation, as it were in the
praise of his Nation, and as Luke sheweth how all thinges
were common amonge the beléeuers at Hierusalem. So did he
put in writing al that euer he sée done at Alexandria, during the
time that Marke there taught & preached. He died in the eight
yeare of Neros reigne, & was buried at Alexandria. In whose
place succéeded Aniamis.

Christ, & beléeue the Scriptures, but a man must subscribe to y•

                  Markes to know the false Apostles by.
                  There are two markes to know the false Apostles by: The
one is when they leaue Christ & serue their bellies, the other
when they regard not the holy Scriptures & preach lyes, and
their owne fantasies, as S. Paule saith, they serue not Christ,
but their owne bellies, and with swéete and flattering words,

deceiue the hearts of the innocents. Rom. 6. 18.

               MARTIR.
               
                  What maketh a Martir.
                  IT is not the death, but the cause of the death that maketh a
Martir. Saint Austen
                     Augustin saith: Tres erant in cruce, &c. There
were three hanged on the crosse: The iust was the Sauiour: the
second to be saued, the third to be dampned: The paine of all
thrée was one, but the cause was diuerse.
Iewel. fol. 30.
                  
                  It is no hard matter by words to testifie the truth. But those
testimonies are most weightie, which are sealed with bloud and
with death. Howbeit this is to be knowne (as Augustine putteth
vs in minde) that the paines and punishmentes or death
make not martirs, but the cause. For otherwise manye suffer
many gréeuous things, which yet are not martirs for the same.
Augustine to Bonifacius of the correction of the Donatists, and
in many other places testifieth, that there were in his time
Circumcelliones, a furious kinde of men, which if they coulde
finde none that would kill them, oftentimes threw themselues
downe headlong, and killed themselues. These men (saith hée)
are not to be counted for martirs. Wherefore there séeme to be
thrée things required to cause a man to be a martir. First, that
the doctrine which he defendeth be true, and agréeable with the
holy Scriptures. The second is, that there be ioyned integritie
and innocencie of lyfe, that he not onely by his death, but also
by his lyfe and manners doe edifie the Church. The third is,
that they séeke not to dye for boasting sake, or desire of name or
fame, &c.

               MASSE.
               
                  How the Masse (as they call it) was vsed
at the first.
                  FIrst they sayd Confiteor and acknowledged themselues to
be sinners. And then the Priest prayed in generall for all
estates and degrees, and for increase of grace, and in especially
if neede required. Unto which prayers the people harkened and
sayd, Amen. And then the Gospell and glad tidings of sorgiuenesse
of sinnes was preached, to stirre our faith, and then
the Sacrament was ministred, for the confirmation of y• faith
of the Gospell, and of the testament made betweene God and
vs of 
                        •
                     orgiuenesse of sinnes in Christs bloud for our repentance
and faith. As ye sée, how after all bargaines, there is a signe
thereof made, eyther clapping of hands, or bowing a pennie or
a grote, or a peece of golde, or giuing some earnest. And as I
shewed you, after a truse made, they slewe beasts for a confirmation.
And then men departed euerye man to his businesse,
full certified that their sinnes were forgiuen, and armed with
the remembraunce of Christs passion & death, for y• mortifieng
of the flesh all the day after. And in all these was neither the
Sacrament, neither other ceremonies of the Masse, Image seruice
to God, & holy déeds to make satisfaction for our sinnes, or
to purchase such worldly things, as the Gospell teacheth vs to
despise. And now compare this vse of the Masse to ours & sée
whether y• Masse be not become y• most damnable Idolatry & Image
seruice that euer was in the world

                  How the Popish Masse is falsified vpon S. Iames.
                  The Papists doe bragge that S. Iames did vse their manner
of Masse at Hierusalem: S. Marke at Alexandria, and S. Peter
at Antioch. But they haue no historie touching this matter
worthy. Though they vsed y• Lords supper as Christ our Maister
did, and as Paule also at Corinth, yet they did not vse it, as
the péeuish Papists doe now the Masse. That Ignatius, Policarpus,
& Ireneus make mention of, is not like the popish Masse.
They confesse y• 
                     Basilius Magnus, Hierome & Ambrose, vsed
an other order in the administration of the Lords supper, then

is now vsed, and that diuerse haue vsed diuerse fashions therin
by their owne words. Therefore it is manifest that this kinde
of Massing is not the ordinance of Christ, but inuēted by mans
wit and pollicie, without the word of God. Thus saith the prechers
of the Gospell at Basil.

                  S. Gregory

in celebrating the Masse, but that they only sayd y• Lords praier,
whose words be these: The manner of the Apostles was, y•
onely at the saieng of the Lords praier they consecrated the sacrament

                  Who so list to know the often alterations and chaunges
of the Masse, let them read Platina, and Polidore Virgil, touching
the same, and ther shall they finde, how & by whom, & vpon
what occasion, and in what processe of time all the parts of the
Masse were peeced and set together. And that in the space of
seauen hundred years, surely and with much ado, it was made
vp at last, and brought to some perfection.
Iewel.
                  
               
               
                  How the Masse is not a sacrifice propiciatorie.
                  It is proued by Saint Paule in his Epistle to the Hebrues,Heb. 9. 28
that the offring of the Priest in the Masse, or the appointing of
his ministration at his pleasure, to them that be quicke or dead,
cannot merit or deserue, neither to himself nor to them for whō
he singeth or saith, the remission of their sinnes, but y• such popish
doctrine is contrarie to the doctrine of the Gospel, & iniurious
to the sacrifice of Christ. For if onely the death of Christ,
be the oblation, sacrifice, and price, wherfore our sins be pardoned,
then the act or ministration of the Priest, cannot haue the
same office. Wherfore it is abhominable blasphemy, to giue that
office or dignitie to a Priest, which perteineth only to Christ: or
to affirme that the Church néed of any sacrifice: as who should
say, that Christs sacrifice were not sufficient for the remission
of our sinnes, or else that his sacrifice shoulde hang vppon the
sacrifice of a Priest.

neither good neither harme. They said Baptime was to no purpose.
Lentus Bishop of Melitena draue the théeues out of their
dennes, the wolues from among the shéepe, & set the Monastaries
on fire. Theodoretus. li. 4. chap. 11. These heretiks wer called
also Euchitae, so called because of their continual praieng. It
is a wonder saith Augustine, to heare what a number of praiers
they run ouer (much like vnto the late mumbling of praiers
vpon beads) where Christ said, pray alwaies, & S. Paule, Pray
without intermission, which is deuoutly to be taken for euery
day, they do it too much, & therfore saith Augustine, to be nūbred
among heretiks. They say when the soule is purged, y• a Sow
with her pigs is séene to come out of mans mouth, & that a visible
fire entereth in, which burneth not. These Euchits did think
that it apperteined not vnto Monks, to get their liuing with y•
sweat of their browes, but to liue idly. Epiphanius saith, that
when Luppicianus the Praetor executed some of them for their
lewdnesse, they called themselues Martirianos. Some of them
thought that it was their duetie to worship the diuell, least he
should hurt them. These were called Satiniani. If ye called any
of them Christ, a Patriarke, a Prophet, or an Angell, he would
answere that he was. They slept like Swine, men and women
all in one heape. August. li de haeraes. Epi. haer. 80. These Massilians

they are not ashamed of inconstancie, by the which
they now call him Maister, whereas before they blasphemed
him, saieng, that he had the spirit of Belzabub, euen so in an
other place, the Pharesies which were the Maisters of

these Ambassadours, sayd vnto Christ, Maister, wée woulde sée
a signe of thee. And againe, Maister, this woman was taken
in adulterie. But they called him Maister, whose disciples they
would not be: for they sayd vnto that begger, to whom Christ
restored his sight, be thou his Disciple, for we are Moses Disciples.
Heere the Prouerbe is fulfilled, Such lippes such lettice.

                  Saint Austen saith,August. li. contra Liar. in cap. 8. Christen men doe mutally commende
themselues in their praiers. But he for whom none maketh intercession,
but he for all, he is the onely & true mediatour. Paule
the Apostle, though he were a principall member vnder y• head,
(yet because he was a member of the body of Christ, & knew that
the greatest & truest Priest of the Church entred, not by a figure
into the inward places of the vaile to heauen, to a holinesse, not
shadowish,Rom. 15. 30 but eternall) commendeth himself also to the praiers
of the faithfull, neither doth he make himselfe a mediatour betweene
the people and God, but praieth that all the members of
the bodie of Christ should mutuallye praye for him, because the
members are careful one for another of all ye members yet trauailing
in earth,1. Co. 12. 20 may ascend to the head which is gone before into
heauen, in whom is apeacement for our sinnes. For if Paule
were a mediatour, ye other Apostles should also be mediatours:
and if there were many mediatours, then neither Paules owne
reason stood fast, in which he had sayd, for there is one God, & one
mediatour betweene God & men,Ephe. 4. 3. the man Christ, in whō we also

are one, if we kéepe the vnitie of faith in the bonde of peace. Againe
in another place, but it thou séeke for a Priest, he is aboue
the heauens, wher he maketh intercession for thée, which in earth
died for thée. Yet do we not dreame, y• he falleth downe at the fathers
knées: and in humble wise intreateth for vs: but we vnderstand
by the Apostle ye he so appeareth before the face of God,
that the vertue of his death auaileth to be a perpetuall intercession
for vs: yet so that being entered into the Sanctuarie
of heauen, vnto the ende of the ages of the worlde, he alone
carrieth to God the prayers of the people, abiding farre off in
the porch.

                  Brethren (saith Saint Austen) we haue Iesus Christ the iust
for our aduocate with the Father, he is the propiciation for our
sinnes. He which held this committed no heresie: he which held
this opinion committed no Scisme. For wherevppon are
Scismes committed? When men doe saye we be iust, wée doe
make holye vncleane, we doe iustifie the wicked, we doe desire
and we doe obteine. But I beséech you by the way, howe much
more past shame be they which doe saye, we doe determine,
we doe commaunde, and what sayde Iohn: And if a man doe
sinne, we haue an aduocate with the Father, Iesus Christ the
iust. But some man will saye: Doe not the Saintes then
praye for vs? Doe not the Bishoppes and superintendentes
pray for the people? Marke the Scriptures, and sée that the ouerséers
also doe commend themselues to the people. For the Apostle
saith to the people prayeng togethers for vs also. The Apostle
prayeth for the people, and the people prayed for the Apostle: we
doe praie for you brethren, but pray fo vs also. Let al the members
pray together one for an other, & let the head make meanes
for all. This saith Augustine in y• place, in which words he doth
plainely & openly attribute the office of intercession, which perteyneth
to the chiefe Priest to none but to Christ the head. Againe
he writeth thus: But if the Apostle shuld haue sayd thus:
This I write vnto you, to the intent yee should not sinne, and in
case anye man doe sinne, you haue a mediatour to the Father.
I doe praye for your sinnes, (as Perminian
                           •

could abide him? Who wold estéeme him as y• Apostle of Christ,
and not rather an Antichrist, for all christen men do commend
themselues one to an other in their praiers, but he for whome
none doth intreate, but he himselfe intreateth for al. He is y• only
and true mediatour, & forasmuch as the figure of him was
resembled in the Priest of the olde Testament, there is none
sound the

                      that euer prayed for the Priest.

                  The man Christ Iesus alone,Basil. which gaue himselfe a raunsome
for al men, is our sufficiēt mediatour, aduocate, & intercessour,
as the holy Scripture teacheth in diuers places. Whosoeeuer
therefore refuseth to pray vnto this man Christ Iesus, to
be his mediatour and aduocate vnto God the father, and flyeth
to other, without all doubt he is an enimie vnto Christ, and to
the vttermost of his power he laboureth to make Christ as they
vse to say, Ia

his chiefe and principall office is to be our intercessour,
mediatour, and aduocate.

                  How he is a figure of Christ.
                  WIthout Father,Heb. 7. 3. without Mother, without kinne, &c. ¶So
called, because that Moses maketh no mention of his parents
& kinsfolkes, but as he had bene sodeinly sent of God into
the world, to be a figure of Christ, or euerlasting Priest, and
shortly taken out of the worlde againe. So Christ as touching
his humanitie had no Father, and concerning his diuinitie had
no mother.

                  ¶It is sayd that Melchisedech is without father & mother,
because that no mention at all in Scriptures is made of his
parents, nor yet of his genealogie. And thus doth the Scripture
declare, y• he is a liuely figure of Christ, which as touching his

Godbead is without mother, being begotten of his father without
all beginnings, and as touching his manhood is without father,
being conceiued by the mighty operation of the holy Ghost.

                  How Melchisedech and Sem is one
person.
                  
                     Lyra sayth, that Melchisedech was the same person which in
Scripture is called Sem, the first son of No
                           •
                        . And S. Paule Heb. 7.
saith that Melchisedech was without father, without mother,
without kinne, and hath neither beginning of his dayes, nor yet
end of his lyfe. So that by this it should séeme Melchisedech &
Sem, not to be one person. To this, aunswere is made on this
wise, that the Apostle reporteth Melchisedech to be without
father & mother, because the Scripture maketh no mention of
them, & not that he was without parents & kinsfolks, &c. For although
y• Scripture make mention of y• father & mother of Sem,
and of his Genelogie, yet it is not vnder the name of Melchisedech,
but vnder the name of Sem. And so is y• Apostle to be vnderstood,
that vnder the name of Melchisedech, no mentton is
made in the Scripture of his father and mother.

                  The meaning of Saint Paule in making mention
of Melchisedech.
                  Saint Paule writing to the Hebrewes, goeth about to disswade
them from the vaine confidence they had in the sacrifices
and ceremonies of Moses lawe, & to perswade them to put their
trust in that onely sacrifice that Christ had offered himselfe once
for all. And least they shoulde reiect his doctrine, as hauing no
ground in holy Scriptures, he putteth them in minde of Melchisedech,
who was a figure of Christ, and of his Priesthoode:
which was also a figure of Christs Priesthoode. First, he was a
figure of Christ (saith Saint Paule) in that he was called Melchisedech,
which is by interpretation the king of righteousnesse,
& the king of Salem, which is the king of peace. And in that hée
was a Priest of the most high God, and hath neither beginning
nor ende of dayes noted in holy histories: his Priesthoode séemed
to be an euerlasting Priesthood, and therfore (saith Saint Paule)
he is likened to the sonne of God that is euerlasting, and hath an
euerlasting Priesthoode, and is alwaie able to saue them, that
séeke saluation at his handes, because he lyueth euer to make intercession

for vs. This is the minde of Paule. And not that
Melchisedech was a figure of Christ and of his Priesthood, in
that he vsed to offer to God a sacrifice of bread and wine, &c.

                  How Melchisedech is brought in of the Papists to
mainteine the sacrifice of the Masse.
                  
                     Melchisedech (say they) was a figure of Christ, for hée was
y• Priest of the highest. And as Dauid saith, Christ is an eternal
Priest, after the order of Melchisedech, and therefore he offered
bread and wine vndoubtedly. Melchisedech was a figure of
Christ, but Saint Paule manifestlye declareth in what thinges
he was the figure of Christ. In the rehearsing of the honours
and dignitie of Melchisedech, which is, that he was an eternall
Priest, and king of peace and righteousnesse. There is not one
word of bread and wine. They cannot finde in the booke of Genesis
that Melchisedech did sacrifice vnto God, but that he offered
bread and wine to Abraham, for sustenaunce of his people,
as Christ offered to vs his worde. Melchisedech brought
bread and wine, and Abraham paide him tithe. Christ after the
same sorte gaue vs the Sacrament of his bodye and bloude, but
he did not offer it to God. The Scripture sheweth forth Melchisedech
vnder the figure of an eternall and onely Priest.
                  But the Papists appoint other Priests to bée Christs Uicars,
after his ascention into heauen. If a man shuld agrée with them
that Christ offred to God bread and wine, yet they cannot proue
that he killed himselfe in sacrifice vnder bread and wine. Also
if Christ offered nothing but bread and wine, the Priests of the
olde lawe did much better, in killing of liuing creatures, to offer
them in sacrifice. The Papists cannot tell what to say. And
when they bring authoritie of Scripture, it maketh against, and
are confuted with their owne saieng, as one that is slaine
with his owne weapon.

                  The interpretation of this word.
                  SOme do thus diuide it,Dan. 5. 25 that both the years of the life of the
king, and also the time of the kings reigne was numbred.
But this subtiltie séemeth not substantiall. Therfore I thinke
(saith Caluine) that this word was added twise, for confirmatition:
as though the Prophet should say, y• the number was now
fulfilled. For in account it is easie to faile, as the prouerb saith.
Wherfore y• 
                     Balthasar might vnderstand that his life and his
kingdome was now at an end, God doth affirme that the number
is full and perfect: as though he should say that there shuld
not be added one minute of an houre to the tearme appointed.

And thus doth Daniel himselfe interpret the same. God (saith
he) hath numbred thy kingdome, that is, God hath appointed &
determined an ende of thy kingdome, so that it must needs come
to an ende, because the time is accomplished, &c.
Caluine vpon Daniel. fol. 89.
                  
                  ¶This word (Mene) is doubled, not onely to exaggerate the
certaintie of the matter, but also as some thinke, the one to signifie
the ende of the King, the other the ende of the kingdome.
The Bible note.
                  
                  ¶This word (Mene) is twice written, for the certaintie of
the thing, shewing that God had most surely counted. Signifieng
also, that God hath appointed a tearme for all kingdomes,
and that a miserable ende shall come on all, that raise themselues
against him.

               MERCIE.
               
                  What mercie is, and how it is defined.
                  
                     CIcero doth define mercie to be the sorrowe of the minde and
griefe conceiued vpon the misery of some other, redy to aids
the same.
                  
                     Seneca in his booke De clementia saith, that mercie is the
griefe of minde, had vpon the séeming of the miseries of others,
or els the sorrow conceiued for other mens euills, which it is
thought that they deserue not.
                  
                     Augustine saith, what is mercie? but a certaine compassion
in our heart of some others misery, wherby we be compelled to
help them if we can. For who knoweth not that mercie is named
of that, that it maketh a mans heart miserable & pitifull,
sorrowing for another mans euill. So they doe define mercie
commonly to be touched & stroken within in the heart, with the
misery of others. The Hebrues do cal mercy by this word 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     
which word doth properly signifie ye belly, & they do apply it vnto
the signification of mercy, because y• the inward parts of them,
which be touched with y• sight of other mens miseries, are wont
to be moued wt some affection of compassion & pitie.Mus. fo. 978.
                  
               
               
                  What it is to haue mercie, or be mercifull.
                  To haue mercie or be mercifull, is to haue compassion,Mat. 5. 7 and
to féele another mans disease, and to mourne with them that
mourne, and suffer with them that suffer, and to helpe and
succour them that are in tribulation and aduersitie, and to
comfort them with good counsell and wholesome instruction,
and louing wordes. And to bée mercifull, is louingly to
forgiue them that offende thee, as soone as they knowledge
their misdoing, and aske thée mercie. To be mercifull, is patiently
long to abide the conuersion of sinners, with a lustie
courage and hope, that God will at the last conuert them, and
in the meane time to pray instantly for them.
                  
                     And to be mercifull, is to interpret all things to the best, and to
looke through the fingers at many things, and not to make a
grieuous sinne of euery small trifle. And to suffer & forbeare
in his owne cause, the malice of them that will not repent, nor
be a knowen of their wickednesse, as long as hée canne suffer
it, and as long as it ought to be suffered, and when he can
no longer, then to complaine to them that haue authoritie to
forbid wrong, and to punish euill doers.

                  Blessed are the mercifull,Mat. 5. 7 for they shall obtaine mercie.
¶Héere God hath made a couenaunt with vs, to be mercifull
vnto vs, if we will be mercifull one to another. So that the
man which sheweth mercie vnto his neighbour, maye bée
bolde, to trust in GOD for mercie at all needes. And contrariwise,Iame. 2. 13
iudgement without mercie, shall be to him that sheweth
not mercie. So now, if he that sheweth no mercie, trust in
God for mercie, his faith is carnall and worldly, and but vaine
presumption. For God hath promised mercie, onely to the mercifull:
and therefore the mercilesse haue not Gods word that
they shall haue mercie: but contrariwise that they shall haue
iudgement without mercie.

                  How the children of God, may and
ought to be merry.
                  TRue it is that the children of God, may will be merry
when they haue prosperitie: lyke as when God sendeth
vs wherewith to be fed and maintained, when he dealeth so

with vs, as we want nothing, when he giueth vs health, quyetnesse,
and all other like things: we may well be merrie, yea,
and we ought so to be, according as it is said in the law, Thou
shalt eate and drinke before thy God and be merry. But yet
must not the faithfull settle their ioye vppon the present benefits,
nor hold themselues onely tyed vnto them: yea, rather if
they want meate and drinke, or be troubled with sicknesse, they
must not therefore cease to trust in God, but must learne Saint
Paules lesson, which is to haue skill both to be poore and rich,
to endure hunger and scarcitie, and also to haue abundaunce.
Thus ye see that the mirth of Gods Children differeth greatly,
from the mirth of the vnbeléeuers and worldlyngs, &c.

                  What Merit is.
                  MErit is sometime taken for the worke it selfe, which is taken
to be meritorious. In which sence, Augustine in a
place saith, that merit must goe before the reward. Sometime
it is taken for the reward, which is worthely giuen to him that
worketh. The first sence is concerning him that worketh, the
la
                        •
                      concerneth him that giueth the reward to the other, &c.

                  What merit of congruence is.
                  Some will haue the merit of congruenceMerit of cōgruēce to be, when although
that he to whom the thing is giuen, bee vnworthye to
haue it giuen him, and that his dooing is not such, that it deserueth
it, yet that it becommeth him, to whome it is done to
giue him: As although the sinner deserue no fauour, yet it is
conuenient for God of his goodnesse, to forgiue the repentaunt,
and to giue him his grace. But some saye that the merit of
congruence, is when a man of his owne good motion comming
by nature doth deserue the first grace, which they call the preuenting
grace.
               
               
                  What merit of worthinesse is.
                  They call the merit of worthinesse,Merit of vvorthinesse when the iust person
doth intreate for the sinner. For they saye, it is worthye
that the iust be heard. So when grace is giuen to the sinner,
at the prayer of the iust, they doe attribute this to
the merit of worthinesse, that is to say, of the iust, which

doth make meanes for him.
               
               
                  What merit of condigne is.
                  They will haue the merit of condigneMerit of cōdigne. to be, when a man
holpen by the first grace, doth make himselfe by the first grace,
worthy of euerlasting life, for he by that meanes doing well, is
worthy (they say) to haue reward for his labour.
                  This pestilent plague of the Pelagians, is to bée withstoode
with all our might, and we must firmely hold, that we cannot
deserue neither grace nor saluation by any strength or works
of our owne, for any merit, either of congruence, worthinesse, or
condigne, but that all is simply and méerly to be referred to the
grace of God in Christ. You be saued through grace, by faith
(saith the Apostle) and that not of your selues, it is the gifte of
God, not by workes, least any man might glorie. After y• schoolmens
diuinitie we should haue saide, you haue deserued your
first grace, by y• good motion of your hearts, produced of nature,
but ye haue not yet obtained saluation, but must deserue the
same by good workes of condigne: when Christ saith, He that
beléeueth in me, hath life euerlasting, he speaketh not lyke a
schooleman. For he should haue said, he that beleeueth in me by
the good motion picked out of nature, he shall deserue the first
grace, but he shall haue euerlasting lyfe, at that time when he
hath deserued it of a condignes, by his good works. Paule calleth
not euerlasting life, the merit of condignes, but the gift of God.
Therefore looke how farre wide this doctrine or the merite of
congruence and condigne, is from the Scriptures, so farre it is
to be cast off from the eares and hearts of the faithfull.

                  THey obiect that saieng of the Apostle: I haue fought a good
fight, I haue runne out my race, I haue kept my faith:
for the rest there is layed vp for me a crowne of iustice, which
which God shall restore mée in that daye, the iust Iudge.
Is not héere mention made of both (say they) by the Apostle,
both the good woorke which hée didde, and the rewarde also,
which hée looked for of God.

he) shall render me my crowne, the iust iudge: Ergo, hée
oweth it me: who shall render it thée than: Ergo, he shall render
it as a iust Iudge, for when he considereth our worke, hée
cannot vpon that consideration of the worke, deny vs a reward.
I haue fought a good fight,2. Ti. 4. 7. it is a worke: I haue finished my
race, it is a worke: I haue kept my faith, it is a worke:
There remaineth a Crowne of Iustice for me, that is the reward.
As for thy rewarde, thou doest nothing, and as for thy
worke thou doest it not alone: Thy Crowne commeth from
him, and thy worke from thy selfe, but yet not without his
helpe. And a lyttle after: Therefore (thou seest) when he doth
render good things, he doth preuent himselfe, giuing good
things to thée before, to whome he maye render good things
also after: Loe, hée rendereth reward vnto that good thing by
the good workes, to him that fought out his fight, to him that
ranne out of his race, and kept his faith. He rendereth good things,
but for what good things? The same that he gaue before himselfe.
Did not he giue it thée to fight out thy good fight? If it
were he that gaue it thée, why doest thou saye in another place,
I haue laboured more then they all: but not I, but the grace
of God with me. Loe thou saist againe, I haue runne out my
race. Did not he giue thee also to runne out thy course? If he
gaue it thée not to runne out thy race, what is that thou sayest
in another place:Rom. 9. 16 It standeth not in the willer nor in the runner,
but in GOD which hath mercie: I haue kept my faith,
hast thou kept thy faith, I knowe it, and am content withall.
I graunt thou hast kept, it. But vnlesse the Lord doe kéepe the
Citie, they doe watch in vayne that doe kéepe it. Therefore
thou hast both fought out thy good fight, and runne out thy race,
and kept thy faith, euen through him as ayding thée, & giuing it
to thée. Giue me leaue O Apostle, I know nothing of thine own
but naughtinesse. Giue me leaue O Apostle, we say, that thou
didst teach: I heare thée confessing God, I finde thee not vnthankefull.
But we perfectly knowe that there be none of
thine owne things gotten to thée by thy selfe, but euill things.
Therefore when God doth crowne thy merites, hée crowneth
nothing els but his owne giftes. Thus saith Saint Austen.

shalt be receiued according to thy deserts, and shall rise againe
to receiue that which thou hast done. Then God shall crowne
not so much thy merits, as his owne gifts. This saith he. And

                     Hierome. after he had recited the opinion of them, which do hold
that after we be departed out of this life, we may both hurt reasonable

Ecclesiasticus
                     Eccl. 9. 5 (The dead knoweth nothing, and there is no reward
any more for them) in this wise: They y• do liue, may for
feare of death do good works, but they which be dead, can adde
nothing to that which they haue caried hence with them out of
this life. Item, They can neither doe iustly nor sinne, not adde
neither vertue nor vice. This saith he. ¶And no doubt, there is
one season to worke in, and another season to receiue for that
which a man hath wrought in this life. And men shall bée
iudged at the iudgment to come, not for the workes or merits
which bée done after this lyfe, but for the same which
is done in this body, as the Apostle saith. Wherefore it appeareth
that we haue no merit, neither before this life, nor in this
life,S. Austen neither after this life.

to doe. Wherefore we must in any wise beware, that we doe
not so establish mans merits, that we do make voyd y• grace of
Christ, and contemne the iustice of God. For merit and grace
be so contrarye one to another, that as Barnard saith, there is
no meanes for grace to enter, where merit doth kéepe place.

were we not vnprofitable: but any good deede of ours is called

But I doe not praise or commend the workes of my handes.
For I am afraid, least when thou lookest vpon them, thou shalt
finde more sinnes than merits. This onely I say, this I praye,
this I couer, Despise not the workes of thine hands. Sée thine
owne worke in me, and not mine: for if thou séest mine, thou
doest condemne, if thou séest thine, thou crownest. For all the
good works that I haue, they come of thée.

of sinnes but through pardon and forgiuenesse of God.Barn. in his ser. of the Ann. of the Vir. Mary

                  Forasmuch as all men are shut vp and closed vnder sinne,Orige. ad Rom li 9. chap. 12.

Gods mercie.
                  For nothing thou shouldest saue them. What is meant
by these words,Augustin For nothing thou shouldest saue them? This
is the meaning, Thou findest nothing in them, wherefore thou

nothing wherefore thou shouldest saue them, but thou findest

wherefore thou shouldest saue them, but thou findest wherefore

                  How the name of merite ought to be
abolished.
                  The name of merit, if we will speake properly, ought to
be banished out of our mouths. I knowe that the fathers somtimes
vsed that word, but yet not properly. But that worde is
not found in all the holy Scriptures. For the nature of merite
is, that there be a iust proportion and equall consideration, betwéene
that which is giuen, and that which is taken. But betwéene
the good things which we looke for, & those things which
we either suffer or doe, there is no proportion or agréement.
                  For Saint Paule saith, that the passions of this time, are not
worthy the glory to come, which shall be reuealed in vs. Farther,
merit hath ioyned vnto it debt: which thing Paule testifieth
when he saith, that to him which worketh, reward is rendered
according vnto debt, & is not imputed according to grace.
Which selfe same Paule writeth expresly, that the grace of God
is eternall life. Lastly, vnto the nature of merite, there is required,
that that which is giuen pertaineth to the giuer, and be not
due vnto him which receiueth it, but workes are not of our
selues, for they are called the gifte of God, which he worketh in
vs. Wherefore Augustine verye wisely saith, that God doeth
crowne his giftes in vs. Now if our workes be due vnto him
(which we cannot denie) then vndoubtedly the nature of merite

is vtterly taken away, &c.
Pet. Mart. vpon
the Rom. fol. 39.
                  
                  Saint Austen saith, Let merites of men héere holde theyr
peace, which haue perished by Adam, and let the grace of God
raigne by Iesus Christ. Againe, The Saints giue nothing to
their owne merits: they will giue all to none but to thy mercie
O God. In another place, When man seeth that whatsoeuer
good he hath, he hath it not of himselfe, but from his God, he séeeth
that all that is praised in him, is not of his owne merites,
but of the mercie of God. You sée how taking from men y• power
of dooing well, he also throweth downe the dignitie of merit.
And Chrisostome saith, Our workes, if there be any, which
followe the frée calling of God, are repaiment and debt: but
the gifts of God, and grace, and bountifulnesse, and the greatnesse
of liberall giuing. But leauing the name, lette vs looke
vpon the thing. I haue verely before alledged a sentence out of
Barnard, as it sufficeth to merit, not to presume to merite: so
to want merits sufficeth to iudgment, but by adding foorthwith

where he saith: Therefore care thou to haue merites: when
thou hast them, knowe that they are giuen: hope for fruit, the
mercie of God: and so thou hast escaped all daunger of pouertie,
vnthankfulnesse, and presumption. Happy is the Church,
which neither wanteth merites without presumption, nor presumption
without merites. And a little before he had largely
shewed, how godly a meaning he vsed. For of merites (saith
he) why should the Church be carefull, which hath a stedfaster
and a surer cause to glory of the purpose of God: God cannot
denye himselfe, he will doe that which he hath promised. If
there be no cause why shouldest aske by what meanes may we
hope for, good things?Eze. 36. 3

                  Of two kindes of meriting.
                  There be two kindes of meriting, that is to say, of good
and euill. The good kinde of meriting, is by Christ, through
Christ, for Christ and in Christ. That is, by casting all our
care on him onely, hauing him continually beaten and crucified
before our eyes, and crucifieng our selues vnto the world, hauing
no trust in our selues, nor in any worke that we can doe,
or any other for vs, setting vp any in heauen, earth, or hell, to
be equall or partner with him: but beléeuing & confessing him
to be all in all things. The onely Creator and maker, the onelye
frée giuer of all goodnesse, and the onely peace maker between
God and vs. The other kinde of meriting is by Satan, the
world and the flesh, contrary in all points to this: that is to say,
taking all cares vpon our selues, séeking wayes to crucifie and
offer vp Christ againe, refusing to crucifie our selues, hauing
all trust in our owne workes and other creatures merites, making
the dead Saints obteiners of merits, through their prayers
and merits, yea, making them mediatours and peace makers
betwéene God and vs.

is somewhat intricate and obscure. Notwithstanding, their
opinion séemeth more probable which interpret this to be spoken
concerning Christ: and so the sence and meaning is, that
the spirite is not giuen by measure to Christ, as though the
grace in him were to be measured: euen as as the Apostle Paule

writtten the last of Deut. That he died in the land of Moab, &
was buried, and that no man did know his sepulcher vnto this
day. The sepulcher of Moses, God would haue it vnknowen,
least the Iewes which counted Moses for such a great and holy
prophet shuld commit Idolatry, & set vp Idolatry vpon y• sepulcher
of Moses, & worship Moses as God, for y• Iewes were
redy to Idolatry. Of this doth y• cōtention appeare to be sprong
betwéen Michael & the diuel, of the which cōtention Iudas héere
speketh of. The diuel wold y• body of Moses to haue ben shewed
to the Iews, that it might haue ben vnto them an occasion
of Idolatry. Michael would it should not haue bene shewed
vnto them, that they should haue hadde by it none occasion of
Idolatry, but that all Idolatry should be vtterly extincted and

put away. Héere you may learne the desire of the Diuel, which
is to mooue to Idolatry, to iniquitie and sinne. Good men then
alway doe disswade from Idolatry & sin

and the Dragon and his Angells did fight with Michael, but
they haue not preuayled, nor yet no place of them was founde
any more in Heauen. But the battayle of which it is heere spoken,
was of the body of Moses, which the Diuell woulde haue
had worshipped, that the Iewes might haue committed Idolatry
on it, Michael did resist him. This is the meaning of this
place (saith the Author) after my opinion, if it be the true meaning
of Iude, take it: if not, take their mindes, that can bring
a better sense, and I my selfe will be glad to learne, of better
learned then I am, (for I am of the least) the true vnderstanding

of a great kinde of punishment, which the Palistines vsed
(as Saint Hierome saith) to punish notable offences and wicked
actes. The Latine text for a Milstone hath Mola asinaria,
which signifieth the great stone that lyeth vnderneath in the
Mill, the which stone in Gréeke is called Asinus,
an Asse, of
the which commeth Asinaria. S. Hillary saith, that it is called,
Mola asinaria, or the Asse stone because the Asse did vse to turne
the same about, at such times as any thing should be ground,
according to the manner of those Mils which we haue in these
daies, in the which an horse being blindfolded, turneth the stone
going still round.

                  NO man shall take the neather or the vpper Milstone to
pledge,Deut. 26. 6 for then he taketh a mans life to pledge. ¶Ey the
neather or the vpper Milstone is signified anie thing, which is
necessary, required to a borrower or a debter, whereof he nourisheth
and susteyneth himselfe, that maye no creditour take
from him, in especiallye his craft and occupation, whereon
he chiefelye liueth, maye hee not by imprisonment,

(which some most cruelly doe) kéepe him from. Least hée bée
compelled to pay his debt with double disprofite, one, that his
milstone is idle in the meane time: another that he is constrained
to come further in debt, otherwise to sell his necessarye
goods, without which he cannot liue to make payment.

               MINISTER.
               
                  What the Minister is by the word
of God.
                  THE true Minister is the eye of the bodye.Mat. 6. 22. The workman
in the haruest. Math. 9. 38. The messenger that calleth to
the marriage. Math. 22. 3. The Prophet that telleth the will
of the Lorde. Math. 23. 34. The Scribes that doth expound the
lawe. The seruaunt that occupieth his Maisters talent vnto
gaine. Math. 25. 16. The witnesse that beareth testimonie of
Christ to all people. Luke. 24. 48. The dispensers of the mysteries
of God. 1. Cor. 4. 1. The Stewardes that giueth meate
in due season, vnto the residue of the householde. Math. 24.
45. The Sacrificer of the Gospell of GOD, to make the
oblation of his flocke acceptable. Rom. 15. 16. The Minister by
whome the people doe beléeue. The labourers of God to till the
husbandry. The Shepheard to féede the Church of God, which
he hath purchased with his bloud.
               
               
                  What men ought to be Ministers in the
Church of God.
                  As in the olde lawe it was forbidden that anye man
shoulde prease to come to the altar, and to offer the bread of
God which had anye manner blemish or deformitie in the bodye:
So ought no man nowe to take vppon him the preaching
of Gods holye worde and ministration of the holye Sacramentes,
that is deformed with vice, but innocent, pure, faultlesse,
and vncorrupt, both in lyfe and doctrine.

                  The qualitie of Gods Minister.
                  They must be blamelesse,1. Tim. 3. 1 watchfull, sober, modest, herberous,
wise, gentle, apt to teach, able to conuince the aduersarie,

such as gouerne wel their whole families, no drunkards,
no quarellers, no contentious men, these be y• qualities that God
requireth.
               
               
                  How ministers ought to be Preachers.
                  He is a dead Priest (saith Gregorie
                     Greg. 24.) and therfore no Priest,
no more then a dead man is a man,Epist. which doth not preach: for
he kindleth the wrath of God the great iudge against him, if he
walke without the sword of preaching.
                  Againe he saith: you Priests encrease your owne sinnes,
with the death of others, and you kill and murther so manye,
as you sée daily without all care (holding your peace) go to their death.
               
               
                  How Ministers ought first to be doers,
and then teachers.
                  But whosoeuer doeth,Math. 5. 19 and teach the same, &c. This that is
spoken héere, perteineth to the ministers of the word. He teacheth
them therefore, what perfection is required of them, namely,
that they expresse & declare those thinges in their life, which
by their doctrine they declare & teach.1. Cor. 9. 27 Saint Paule did chastise
his bodie and brought it into subiection, least when he preached
to others, he himself shuld be a castaway. And writing to Timothy,
                     1. Tim. 4. 12
Be (saith he) vnto them ye beléeue an example in word,
in conuersation, in loue, in spirit, in faith, in purenesse. And to
Titus
                     Tit. 2. 7. (he saith) in all things shew thy selfe an example of good
works, in the doctrine, with honestie, with grauitie, & with the
wholesome worde, which cannot be rebuked, that he which
withstandeth, may be ashamed, hauing no euill to say on you.

Marl. fol. 92.
                  
                  ¶Whosoeuer doth,Mat. 5. 19. &c. Christ maketh mention first of the
worke, and then of the doctrine, for if the workes goe before,
though the doctrine doe not followe, yet shall the verye worke
more suffice to teach them that looke vpon vs, then any words
shall doe.
                  First of all teach with works, and then with wordes: least
the saieng of Saint Paule be obiected:Rom. 2.

                     For it is very shame, when a man will preach,
                  If that his deeds against his words doe teach.

                  How the Ministers of the Church are called
Starres.
                  The seauen Stars are the Angels of the seauen Churches.Apo. 12. 7.
¶The ouerséers of Churches are in Scriptures called Stars
and Angels. Starres in respect of the brightnesse, both of their
heauenly doctrine, and of their heauenly conuersation. Angels
because they report vnto vs the will of God the Father. According
also as in the same respect Christ is called the Angell of
the Testament, Mal. 3. 1. And Iohn Baptist is called an Angell,
Mal. 3. 1. Math. 11. 10. So also in this place the rulers of the
Churches are called Angells, which thing appeareth chieflye
héerby, that héereafter in y• second chapter & the first verse, they
be willed to repent, which thing coulde in no wise agrée with
the heauenly spirits. Therfore like as the Starres shine in the
Skie, so must the ministers of Gods word shine in y• Church, &
goe before other in purenesse of doctrine and christen conuersation.
But a great part of them (alas for sorrowe) walke as
enimies of Christs crosse, whose end is damnation, whose God
is their belly, and their glorie is shame which séeke after earthly
things, when as notwithstanding their conuersation ought
to be heauenly. Phil. 3. 18.

                  How ministers were chosen in the olde time.
                  Ministers in the olde time were elect and chosen by the
whole consent of the people, as Cypriane
                     Cipriane. reporteth. The
common people themselues haue before all other, power either
to choose worthy Priests, or to refuse the vnworthy. This
order tooke his beginning of Gods authoritie, for God sayd to
Moses: Take thy brother Aaron and Ehazarus his sonne, and
set them on the mount before all the co

                     gregation, and put off
Aarons apparell, and put it vpon Eleazarus his son, which declareth
that ministers ought not to be admitted vnto the ministrie,
but with the consent and knowledge of the people.
Theo. Basil.
                  
                  In olde time none was receiued into the companie of

clarkes, without the consent of all the people, insomuch that
Cipriane laboured earnestly to excuse y• he appointed one Aurelius
to be a reader, without asking aduise of y• church, because
y• was done beside the custome, though not without reason. For
this he saith before: In ordering of clarks déere brethren, we are
wont to aske your aduise, and by common counsell to weigh y•
manners & deseruings of euery one. But because in these lesser
exercises there was not much perill: because they were chosen
to a long proofe, and not to a great office, therfore y• consent
of the people ceased to be asked. Afterward in the other degrées
also, except the Bishoprick, the people commonly left y• iudgement
and choise of them to the Bishop & the Priests, that they
should examine who were méet and worthy, sauing peraduenture
when new Phriests were appointed for the Parishes: for
then it behoued that the multitude of the place namely should
consent. Whether it is any meruaile y• the people in his behalfe
was little carefull in kéeping their owne right, for no mā was
made a subdecon that had not shewed a long proofe of himselfe
in his being a clarke vnder y• seueritie of discipline, which then
was vsed. After y• he had ben tried in y• degrée, he was made a
Deacon. From thence he came to y• honour of Priesthood, if hée
had behaued himselfe faithfully. So no man was promoted, of
whome there had not ben in déed a trial had many years before
y• eies of the people. And there were many Canons to punish
their faults. So y• the Church could not be troubled with euill
Priests, or deacons, vnlesse it neglected y• remedies: howbeit in
y• Priests also ther was required y• consent of them of ye same
citie: which ye very first canō testifieth in his. 67. distinctiō which
is fathered vpō 
                     Anacletus. Finally al y• admissiōs into y• orders
were therfore done at certein appointed times of y• yeare, y• no
man should priuely créepe in without the consent of the faithfull,
or should with too much easinesse be promoted without
witnesses.

                  Why the Ministers are not now chosen as they
were in the primitiue Church.
                  The alteration of gouernement and orders of the Church
of Christ is well set out by Ambrose, in the. 4. to the Eph. vpon
these words, Et ipse dedit, &c. Wher he saith on this sort. That
the number of the Christians might increase and be multiplied,
in the beginning it was permitted to euery one to preach
the Gospell, to baptise, & to expound the Scriptures, but when
the Church was enlarged, there were certeine preachers appointed,
& gouernours, & other officers ordeined in the church,
&c. Therfore the writings of the Apostles doe not in all things
agrée with the orders that are now in the church.
D. Whitegift.
                  
                  
                     Musculus also in his common places answering to this question,
why that Ministers of the word, are not chosen now by
the Ministers and the people, as they were in the Primitiue
Church, but appointed by the Magistrate, saith thus: Such was
the state of the Churches, that they could choose their Ministers
none otherwise, because they had no christen magistrate. If thou
wouldest haue the manners and customes of these times, then
must thou call backe their condition and state.
               
               
                  How Ministers ought not to forsake their vocation.
                  Ministers must abide in their vocation, so long as y• strength
of the bodie will suffer them, and that they be not thrust out by
force. For y• men & people cōmitted to their charge, ought neuer
to be forsaken, so long as they can abide to heare ye word of God.
And if they be altogethers contēners of y• word of y• Lord, & wil
not suffer it to be preached, then as Christ cōmaunded his Apostles,
let them shake of the dust of their feete against them, &
depart. But so long as there are anie among them, which will
suffer ye pastor to preach, & to intreat of ye word of God, he ought
not to giue ouer his ministratiō. Wherfore I know not whether
Melitius did wel or no, or whom Theodoretus maketh mentiō
in his. 2. booke. 31. chap. y• he forsooke the Bishoprick of a certein
church in Armenia, being offēded with ye ouer great disobediēce
of his flock. But ye same man afterward being chosē Bishop of
Antioch, was for ye defēding y• catholike faith against ye 
                     Arriās
                     
thrust into exile. In which fact, God peraduenture declared that
he was not wel pleased, that he had departed from his first vocation.

                  The Scribes & Pharesies sit in Moses,
                     Mat. 23. 2. &c. All therfore whatsoeuer
they bid you obserue, that obserue and do, but after their
works do not, for they say & do not, &c. ¶Behold y• Lord sayth,
they say and doe not: therefore the teachers liues were not agreeable
to their doctrine: yet for that they stood in Moses seate,
that is to say, because they taught the word of God lawfullye,
and sincerely, he biddeth to receiue their sincere doctrine, but
their life not being agréeable to their doctrine, that he biddeth
to refuse: And therfore to make a scisme for the Preachers euil
liues sake, the Lord doth forbid.

               MIRACLES.
               
                  A definition of true Miracles.
                  A Miracle is a worke, hard and vncustomed by the power of
God, which passeth all facultie of nature created, to this
ende wrought, to cause the beholders to wonder and to confirme
faith towards the worde of God. Wherefore the matter
of miracles are workes, and the forme is, that they be harde
and vnaccustomed. The efficient cause is the power of God,
which ouercommeth nature created, & the end of them is both
admiration and also confirmation of faith.

                  To what vse Miracles doe serue.
                  Miracles serue for thrée vses. First, that he which is healed
thereby shoulde sinne no more
                        •
                      Secondlye, that the beholders
shuld put their trust in the healer. Thirdly, that we which read
of the miracles of the Lord, should be confirmed in the glorye
and doctrine of Christ, and therewithall conceiue faith in him.

                        o. Homil. 29 be not in loue with signes, which may be had
common with the reprobate, but loue ye rather miracles of charitie
and true godlynesse, which the more secret, the more secure,
and for the which the lesse estimation that there is with
men, the greater is the reward with God. In the beginning &

gathering of y• Church many things were necessary which now
is néedlesse.Similitude Miracles were vsed then, which outwardly be diuided
now. When we go about to plāt a tree, so long we water it,
vntill we sée it haue takē root. But whē it is once substantially
grounded, & braunches spread abroad, we take no more paine to
water it: on like sort, as long as y• people were altogether faithlesse,
this meane of miracles was of indulgence graunted them.
But when spirituall instruction had taken better place, the corporall
signes surceased straight. Wherefore the Apostle sayth:
Lingua in signum sunt, non fidelibus sed infidelibus. Straunge
tongues are for a signe, not to them that beléeue, but to them
that beléeue not. And plainly to argue that a thing is good, because
a miracle is shewed by it, or else to approue a present
vse, by that which néedfully sometime was done, hath too many
absurdities and inconueniences to bée yéelded to.

                  Whether we should beleeue miracles.
                  If onely the word of God is to be beléeued, why said Christ,
that if they would not beléeue him, they should yet at the least
beleeue his works. To this we aunswere, that miracles are as
testimonies, by which men are the easilier brought to beléeue,
so that they are things, by meanes whereof men beléeue, not
that faith is directed vnto them, as vnto his obiect: although as
touching the miracles of Christ & of the Apostles, we must beléeue y• they were done by God, & not by Belzabub or by the diuell,
as the Pharesies slaunderously reported: and this is conteined
in the word of God, for it giueth testimony y• these miracles
should be wrought, & that they were wrought in their due
time, namely in the preaching of the second doctrine, &c.

                  Why miracles be not done now a daies.
                  To these that demaund this question: why is not miracles
done now a daies by the ministers of Gods word Aunswere.
Because that the glorie of Christ & truth of Gods word, was
confirmed by miracles long agoe, which being done they haue

discharged their duetie.

                  In the end of time power shalbe giuen to the diuel,Chriso. in Mat. homil. 49. to work
profitable signes and miracles: so that then we cannot knowe
the mysteries of Christ, by that they work profitable miracles,
but by that they worke no miracles.

by the Priestes, or else by their companions for lucre
sake.

in the Church, not by the power of God, as many one thinke,
but by the illusion of Satan rather, who (as the Scripture witnesseth)
hath bene loose now abroad. 500. yeares, according as it
is written in the booke of the Apocalips: after a thousand years
Satan shall be loose, &c. Neither are they to be called miracles
of true christian men, but illusions rather, whereby to delude
mens mindes, to make them put their trust in our Ladie, and
in other Saints, and not in God alone, to whom be honour and
glory for euer.

                  How to know true miracles from false.
                  Euen as we take those Sacraments for true Sacraments &
ceremonies, which preach vnto vs Gods word: so do we account
these for true miracles only, which moue vs to harken vnto y•
word of God. Other rule thē this to discerne thē by, ther is not:
namely, y• the true are done to prouoke mē to come & harkē vnto
Gods word: and y• false to confirme doctrine y• is not gods word.
               
               
                  How faith grounded vpon miracles abideth not.
                  What a multitude came out of Aegipt vnder Moses, of which

Moses. Neuertheles y• scripture testifieth, y•. vi. hundred thousād

and shall shew great miracles. Also in the same chapter,
(verse. 5.) Many shall come in my name, &c. by the which words
it appeareth: that they must be in the church of Christ, & of them
that shall call themselues Christians.
               
               
                  What the cause of false miracles is.
                  The cause of false miracles is, for that they loue not the
truth: and therfore God hath promised by S. Paule to send them
abundance of false miracles to stablish them in lies, and to deceiue
them & lead them out of the way, so that they cannot but
perish for their vnkindnesse, that they loued not ye truth, to liue
thereafter, and to honour God in their members.
               
               
                  How miracles are done in these daies.
                  The Church of Christ is a little flocke, which the diuel the
king of darknesse and Antichrist the people do persecute, and
bend all their force against it. And yet Gods so miraculously defendeth
the same, that all they (without Gods permission) cannot
touch the least number thereof. This presence of God in
his Church, is miraculous inough, so that we néede not to seeke
any other miracles.

               MIRRHE ALOES AND CASSIA.
               
                  A briefe declaration of these three
wordes.
                  MIrrhe is a little shrubby trée growing in the hot countrey
called Arabia foelix, the fruitfull Araby, or the wealthy &
plentifull Araby: so called in respect of the other that is but
barren. This Mirrhe trée is lowe and full of prickes, as our
thornes and briers be. The 
                        •
                     auour and smell of the woode, is
singularly pleasant: so likewise is the iuyce or the Gumme
thereof called Guttaa distillando, like as of the Greekes i
                        •
                     
is called Stacte. In steede of this worde Gutta or State,
some Interpreters doe translate Aloes. Aloes is a
shrub
                        •
                     e growinge in Arabia also, whereof there bée

two kindes, the one cleane contrary to the other: for the one
hath a very stinking sauour, and is of a meruailous bitter tast.
And of that kinde of Aloes speaketh Iuuinal, or rather the prouerbiall
sentence vsed by Iuuinal: Plus Aloes quam melles
habet, It is a thing that hath more bitternesse then swéetnesse
in it. As if a man would say, to beare office séemeth to be
a pleasant thing, but if the displeasure and daunger therof be
well considered, Plus Aloes quam mellis habet. There is another
kinde of Alos of most pleasant and swéet sauour, of which
mention is made in y•. 7. chapter of y• Prouerbs: Salomon counterfaiting
the pleasant speach of an harlot, alluring young men
vnto her sensuall purpose, saith in her person on this wise: I
haue made me a gorgeous chamber, Et cubile meum odoratum
reddidi mirrha, Aloe & Cynamome: And I haue made my bed
excéeding swéet (not wt damask water) but with Mirrhe, Aloes,
and Cynamome. Of Mirrhe & Aloes Nichodemus that came to
Christ in the night seson, made a fine and costly mixture, therwith
to anoint the dead bodie of Christ, lieng in the sepulchre.
                  
                     Cassia is of like oderiferous a pleasaunt sauour, y• Mirrhe,
and Aloes be, which thrée being ioyned togethers, must néeds
make a swéete smell, as it is spoken of the Prophet by Salomon,
Mirrham, Guttam siue stactem, siue Aloen & Cassiam,
redolent omnia vestementa tua, All thy garments doe smell of
mirrhe, aloes, and Cassia, that is to say, thy garmentes are excéeding
pleasant and swéete.

to say, it representeth his bodie that was broken for us, & kéepeth
it in our remembrance. The Communion is Christs pason

it were red hot, and when the childe should be put into the

                  Of the Monkes that be now.
                  If the name of Monks (that is to say, Solitari) be not sufficient
to declare that those which at this day be named Monks,
be nothing lesse then that they be called, there be other reasons
sufficient to conuince them. For the auncient Monestaries,
were as Colleges, into the which men resorted, for two causes.
First, the better to be at quiet to studie Scriptures. The
second to exercise patience and austeritie of life. Notwithstanding,
it was not to be strained and bound to one place during
lyfe without exception, but contrariwise to be the more méet to
serue the churches when they should be called and elected therunto,
as it appeareth by Gregorie Nazienzene, Basile, & Chrisottome,
namely, in S. Augustines time. To be idle and not to
worke with the hands was intollerable: for on the contrary,
they liued onely by the labour of their owne handes, yea, and
they did giue the rest of their labour vnto the poore. So that a
Monke not trauailing for his liuing, was estéemed as a thée
                        •
                     e,
according to the rule of S. Paule. And to put saluation partly
or altogether in their abstinence, how extreme or hard so euer
they wer, they neuer thought it. For they knew very wel what
S. Paule had written of that point. Moreouer S. Austen testifieth
and saith. Let none be oppressed aboue his power, least
ther be superstition in the abstinence of meates, for the weake
refusing foolishly the vse of wine, were admonished brotherly,
that by their superstition they brought themselues rather more
weake then holy, it appeareth moreouer by that which S. Cipriane
sayd, y• it wer better for the virgins, which wer dedicate
by promise vnto God (y• is to wit, to the seruice of the poore, & not
to be idle in couents) if they wold not or could not continue, y•
they should marry rather then fall into the fire and burne by
their delights, as also Paule hath ordeined. If this be heresie,
then Saint Cipriane must be an heretike. Theo. Beza.

their backbiting of Priests, and if there come an holy day, they
ease vntill they be faine to perbrake.

not onely idle, but also curious and full of words, speaking such

our owne free-will.
                  If you mortifie the déedes of the flesh by the spirite,Rom. 8. 13 ye shall
liue. ¶S. Austen vpon this place: Thou wilt say (saith he)
that can my will doe, that can my frée-will doe: What will,
what manner of free-will, except he lift thée vp, thou lyest still:
how canst thou doe it then by thy spirit, seeing that the Apostle
saith, as many as be led by the spirit of God, be the children of
God: wilt thou doe of thy selfe: Wilt thou be ledde of thine
owne selfe, to mortifie the déeds of the flesh? What wil it profite
thée, for if thou be not voluptuous with the Epicures, thou
shalt be proud with the Stoikes. Whether thou be an Epicure
or a Stoike, thou shalt not be among the children of God, for they
that be guided by the spirit of God, be the children of God, not
they that lyue after their owne flesh, not they that lyue after
their owne spirit, but as many as be led by the spirit of God.
But héere a man will say, Ergo then are we ruled, and we doe
not rule. I auns were, thou both rulest, and art ruled. But thou
dost then rule well, if thou be ruled by the good spirit, vtterlye
if thou doe want the spirit of God, thou canst doe no good. Thou
dost truly without his helpe by the frée-will, but it is but euill
done, vnto that is thy will, which is called frée-wil, and by euill
doing is she made a bondseruaunt. When I say, Without the
help of God thou dost nothing, I vnderstand by it, no good thing.
For to doe euill, thou hast frée-will without the helpe of God,
though that be no fréedome. Wherefore you shall know, that so
doe you goodnesse, if the helping spirite bée your guider: the
which if he be absent, can doe no good at all.

for his daughters sake tooke the childe Moses in his armes,

playing, hurled if downe to the ground, and with his fee

out saieng, that this was he, whom before he had prophecied
should be borne, which should destroy the kingdome of Aegypt,
except he wer

discretion. And for proofe thereof caused burning coales to bée
put to his mouth, which the childe with his tongue lick

he euer after had an impediment in his tongue. And by this

the Oxen be slaine for this people to eate, which are vi. hundred
thousand, or shall the fish of the Sea be gathered together
to serue them. ¶Héere it séemeth that Moses did doubt in Gods
promise, which was not so. For he doubted no more that God
was able to accomplish and fulfill his word: then Mary the mother
of Christ did doubt in the words of the Angell,Luk. 1. 34. when shée

vncircumcised, would yet goe into Aegypt, to remaine among

                  When Moses complained vnto the Lord,Nu. 11. 14 that he was not able
to beare the burthen of the murmuring people alone, God
commaunded him to choose out. 70. of the Elders of Israel,
and bring them before him, and he would take of his spirit and
giue vnto them, and they should beare the burthen of the people
with him,Nu. 11. 14 Then Moses willing to quench the murmuring of
the Iewes against him, chose out of euery Tribe. 6. because he
would not take out of One Tribe more then another. So that
the number taken out of twelue Tribes came to. 72. And
because the Lord commaunded no moe but 70. Moses made 72.
littlle rolles of paper, & writ in them all sauing in two (wherin
was nothing written) and put them all in a vessel togethers
that no man saw them: and then each one should take out a
paper as his fortune was, and whosoeuer did lyght vpon the
papers vnwritten, it was a signe that God would not haue
them counted among the Seniours. Now were there two of
them named Eldad and Medad.
                     Eldad & Medad. whose chaunce was (by Gods
prouidence) to draw the papers vnwritten, wherfore they went
not vp with the other 70. to the Tabernacle, but remained in
the hoast, vpon whom (neuerthelesse) the spirit of Prophecie rested,
so that they prophecied. Then Iosua the sonne of Nun, hearing
how they had prophecied of the death of his maister Moses,
and how that Iosua should lead the people of Israel into the
Land of promise, spake vnto Moses, to forbid them. But Moses
not discontent with their prophecieng, wished that all the people
could prophecie, and that the Lord would put his spirit vppon
them all.

                      Surely that reason ought to satisfie vs, to say that the
Lawe and the Prophets had no other scope or ende, then Christ.
For it was a great aide & helpe to our faith, that Christicame
not forth without testimonie, but was commended of God long
before. Therefore in Moses the Lawe, and in Helias the Prophets
are represented.

                  The Scribes and Pharesies sit in Moses seate, &c.Mat. 23. 2 ¶Christ
speaketh of them that doe teach the Lawe of Moses, and not of
such as wrap them in the constitutions of men. And euen now
haply must the Bishop be heard that doth truly teach the Gospell,
though he lyue skant Gospell lyke. But who can suffer
them against Christs doctrine, for their owne profites, to make
and vnmake lawes, exercising vpon the people plaine ¶Tyranny,
and measuring all things for their owne aduauntage and authoritie.
They that with traditions imagined for their owne
lucre and tyranny, do hamper the people, do not sit in the chaire
of the Gospell, but in the chaire of Symon Magus and Cayphas.

was truly and rightly to instruct
the people, and to open vnto them the law of Moses. S. Austen
saith, Sedendo super cathedram Mosis, &c. Sitting vpon Mofes
chaire, they teach the lawe of God: Therefore it is God that
teacheth by the meanes of them. But if they will teach you
things of their owne, then heare them not, then dde it not. For
certainly such men séeke their owne, and not the things that
pertaine to Christ Iesu.
                  ¶The Chaire of the which our Sauiour Christ maketh
mention héere, doth not signifie the authoritie of Moses, which
the Scribes abused, but it signifieth the place out of the which,
they purely red and interpreted the law of Moses. ¶To sit

of God, how men ought to liue. And although it be not certaine
out of what place they didde speake or preach, yet notwithstanding
their coniectures is probable, which referre it to the
Pulpet which Esdras made, to haue the Laws taught in. He
therefore sitteth in Moses Chaire, which preacheth not of his

Marl. vpon Math. fol. 521.
                  
                  ¶So long as the Scribes safe in Moses seate, and continued
in the pure and simple interpretation of the Lawe, teaching
those things which the Lord had commaunded, and taught in
the name of God. For Saint Austen very well and according
to the minde of Christ expoundeth that the Scribes sitting vpon
Moses seate, taught the Lawe of God, and that therefore the
shéepe ought to heare the shepheards by them as by hirelings.
To the which words he addeth by and by saieng: God therefore
teacheth by them. But if they goe about to teach theyr
owne inuentions, neither heare them nor follow them. To the
which sentence agréeth that which the same Father hath in his
fourth booke De doctrina Christiana, saieng: Because the good
and faithfull do not heare euery man, but obediently heare God
himselfe, therefore they are heard profitably, which also lyue not
profitably. Therefore the seate, not of the Scribes, but of Moses,
constrained them to teach, that which was good. For in their
life, they did what them lust, but the seate being none of theirs,
suffered them not to teach what they lusted.

                  We read of Moses the seruaunt of the Lorde,Deu. 36. 6 that hée died
in the lande of Moab, and the Angell of the Lord buryed him
in a valley, but no man knoweth of his Sepulcher vnto this
daye, which thing was of purpose by the prouidence of God,
appointed so: that the Iewes might haue no occasion thereby
to com

had bene either for the glorye of God or commoditie of man,
the reliques of such a one as Moses was, should not haue bene
hidden. For doubtlesse of all Prophets he was the greatest, by
the testimonie of God himselfe, who called him faithfull in all
his house, to whom he spake mouth to mouth, & by vision, and
not in darke wordes, and yet was not his body shrined, nor his
bones carried in procession, nor anye Chappell erected for him.
Indeed the Diuell did attempt no lesse, then to make it matter
of superstition (for we read that there was a strife betwixt him

and Michael about Moses body) but the Angell of the Lorde
withstood him.

Bishop, the Uicar and stepfollower of that méeke Lambe,
and the successour of Peter, whome Christ commaunded to put
vp his sword. And there be other of the chiefe Prelates also,

of Peter, in that he hath not yet put vp his sword. Of the

that he hath added these helpes wherewith the faithfull are

whereof mention is made oftentimes in the Psalmes, was a

of the Temple. For at this daye, if the faithfull cheere vp
themselues with instruments of Musicke, I saye their purpose
ought to be, not to seuer their mirth from the praises of God.
But when they haunt their holy assemblies, I think that musicall
instruments are no more méet for ye setting forth of Gods
praises, then if a man shall call againe sensing and lampes, &
such other shadowes of the lawe. Foolishly therfore haue y• Papists
borowed this & many other things of the Iewes. Men y•

                     Augustine in the booke of Confession, both confesseth, and
also is sorie, that he had sometimes fallen, because he had giuen
more autentiue héede vnto the measures and cords of musicke,
then the words which were vnder them spoken. Which
thing héereby he proueth to be sinne, because measure and singing
were brought in for the wordes sake, and not wordes for
musicke. And he so repented him of his fault, that he excéedingly
allowed the manner of the Church of Alexandria vsed vnder
Athanasius. For he commaunded the reader, that when hée
song, he shuld but little alter his voice, so that he should be like
rather vnto one that readeth, then to one that singeth. Howbeit
on the contrarye, when he considered how at the beginning
of his conuertion, he was inwardly moued with these things,
namely in such sorte, that for the zeale of pi

                     tie he burst forth
into teares, for this cause I saye, he consented that musicke
should be reteyned in the Church, but yet in such manner,
that he sayd he was readie to chaunge his sentence
                        •
                      if a better

reason could be assigned. And he added, that those do sinne deadly,
as they were wont to speak, which giue greater heed to musicke,
then vnto the word of God, to which sentence vndoubtedly

Gregory also of Rome in the Sinode of Rome, was
of the same opinion, and both their wordes are written in the
Decrées, dist. 92. in the Chapter, Cantantes, and in the Chapter
In sancta Romana. In which place are read in the Glose, two
verses, not indéede so eloquent, but yet godly.
                  Non vox sed votum, non cordula musica sed cor,

But ye voice not crieng, but louing, singeth in the eares of God.
                  And in the words of Gregorie, this is not slightly to be passed
ouer, in that he saith, Whilest the swéetnesse of the voice is
sought for, the life is neglected, and when wicked manners prouoketh
God, the people is rauished by the pleasantnesse of the
voice.

                     NAaman the Sirian was (no doubt) a good and godly man,4. Reg. 5.
& had a religious & reuerent opinion of God. And although
he was a Gentile and belonged not to the kingdome of Moses,
which then flourished: yet notwithstanding his flesh was clensed,
& the God of Israel was reuealed vnto him, & he receiued
the holy Ghost, for thus he saith: Now I know assuredly that
there is none other God in all the world, but in Israel. He doth
nothing at all, he kéepeth not the law, he is not circumcised, but
onely praieth that so much of that earth might be giuen vnto
him, as two mules should be able to carrie away Moreouer it
appeareth that faith was not idle in him, for he saith to the Prophet
Eliseus, Thy seruaunt will henceforth neither offer burnt
sacrifice nor offering vnto any other God, sauing the Lorde.
But in this thing, the Lord be mercifull vnto thy seruaunt:

                      and I boowe my selfe in the house of
Rimmon, &c. He feeleth his conscience wounded in béeing present
at Idolls seruice, & therefore desireth God to forgiue him,
least others by his example might fall to Idolatrie: for as for
his owne part, he confesseth that he will neuer serue anie but
the true God.

¶Under pretence of religion and holinesse in making an Image
to his Idoll Bel, he sought his ambition and vainglorie:
And this declareth he was not touched with the true feare of
God, but that he confessed him of a sodeine motion, as the wicked
when they are ouercome with the greatnesse of his works.
The Gréeke interpreters write that this was done. 18. yeares
after the dreame, and as may appeare, the king feared least the
Iewes by their religion should haue altered the state of his
common weale, & therefore he meant to bring all to one kinde
of religion, and so rather sought his own quietnesse then Gods

               NATVRE.
               
                  What Nature is.
                  NAture (saith Plato) is that thing that God will. His meaning
is, that nature is subiect and obedient ot God: and
that there is neither chaunge nor necessitie in the course of nature,
but al things are ordred by Gods omnipotencie, & natural
causes are onely the instruments of Gods will. It was Gods
will that Christ should take the natural substance of mans body,
& that in al things he shuld be like vnto his brethren, & that
his body should be a creature. And as S. Austen saith, should
be in one place. This is Gods knowne and expresse will. Therfore
by Platos iudgement, this is nature.
                  Nature is sundrie waies defined. Some doe take it to be a
certeine strength voide of reson, stirring vp necessarie motions
in our bodies. Againe, some doe iudge it to be a strength which
hath reson & order, as procéeding some certein way, & declaring
what the cause of euery thing worketh, & what followeth the
quicknes & actiuitie. Wherof no art nor hand, neither workmā
is able to attaine vnto by immitation or following it. Epicure
doth call all thinges by the name of nature. Augustine defineth
it after this manner. Nature (saith he) is a certein strength
& power put into things created by God, which giueth to each
that which belongeth vnto it. Surely the very word séemeth to
signifie, that nature is called to be the same, which is proper
vnto euery thing, & that as grafted & bred in it at the verye beginning,
so y• whatsoeuer any thing is of ye birth as it were, y• is
the nature therof. Lactantius saith: y• nature is termed of ye latin
word Nascendo, which is of birth. My opinion (saith Lactantius)
is not, y• nature is the thing it selfe, but ye proper & peculiar
strength of the thing naturally giuen vnto it, straight way frō
                     
the beginning therof, whereby it receiueth y• qualitie, which it
hath not only of being, but also of doing, bearing & begetting, &c.
               
               
                  What the nature of Gods word is.
                  The nature of Gods word is, y• whosoeuer readeth it, or heareth
it reasoned & disputed before him, it will begin immediatly
to make him euery day better & better, till he be growne to
a perfect man in the knowledge of Christ, & loue of the lawe of
God, or else make him worse & worse, till he be hardned, y• he

                  What the nature of God is.
                  Of the nature of God Augustine writeth on this wise: All
natures either is God who hath no beginning, or is not God,
because he is the beginner therof. As for y• which hath God for
y• beginner of it, by whō it is, some is not made, & some is made.
That which is not made, & yet for all that is of him, either is
begotten of him, either procéedeth frō him. That which is born,
is the onely sonne: That which procéedeth is the holy spirit, and
this trinitie is of one and selfe same nature. For these three be
one, & each of them is God, & altogether one God, immutable:
euerlasting, without any beginning or end of time. But nature
which is made, is called a creature, & God is called a creator, I
meane the Trinitie.

religion and the professing therof: the which consent and
professing beeing chaunged into the consent and professing

Christianitie, there can sticke in the things themselues, no note
or marke of Antichristes religion. The vse of Bells was a
marke of Antichristianitie in our Churches, when the people

which in no wise receiue the law writtē in their harts, but rise
against Princes and rulers, whensoeuer they are able to make
their partie good: These are signified by them that worshipped

                     e, for Moses brake the table of the lawe, ere hée
came at them. The second are not so beastly, but receiue y• law,
and vnto them the lawe commeth, but they looke not Moses
in the face, for his countenaunce is too bright for them, that is,
they vnderstand not that the lawe is spirituall, and requireth
the heart, they looke on the pleasure, profit, and promotion that
followeth the kéeping of the law, and in respect of the reward,
kéepe the lawe outwardly with workes, but not in the heart.
For if they might obteine like honour, glory, promotion, & dignitie,
and also auoide all inconueniences, if they breake the
lawe, so would they also break the law and follow their lusts.
The third are spirituall, and looke Moses in the open face, and
are (as Paule saith) a lawe vnto themselues, and haue the lawe
written in their hearts, by the spirit of God. These néed neither
of king nor officer to driue them, neither that any profer them
any reward for to kéepe the lawe, for they doe it naturally. The
first work for feare of the swoord. The second for reward. The
third worke for loue.

of Hierusalem, and in their imprisonment at Babylon, at both
these times were they motherlesse & helplesse concerning their
owne strength, but were yet cared for of God, and receiued by
his mercie. The Prophet borroweth his fashion of speaking of

miseries, & were regarded as bastards, & vnworthely intreated
of all men. Ther was no man but only God that tooke thought
for them, and that he onely of his méere mercie without anye of

ought to be loued, and wouldest haue a plaine example
thereof, consider well how thou louest thy selfe. If thou shouldest

                  What it is to be new.
                  THat is knowne to be new which neither euer was before,
nor hath bene yet séene or heard of, but now beginning and
commeth to light first. And therfore Salomon saith, that ther is

nothing vnder the Sunne that is new, nor that it can be sayde
loe, that is new: for that it hath gone, and ben before in times
past. Indéede a thing seemeth to bée new, when it hath bene in
times past, and is now corrupted and perished, either by time,
abuse, or negligence of men, by restoring againe is renued,
not that it beginneth now first to bée, but rather to be the same
which it was before. And in v
                        •
                     rie déede it is nothing lesse then
new. For it is one thing to make a thing new, and to renue
a thing which was made long agoe. They be sayde to make
new things, which doe in
                        •
                     titute new things before vnused and
vnknowne, and they are sayde to renewe, which doe restore
things decaied, vnto their olde estate and vse. So the lawe was
new, which was giuen by Moses to be kept of the Israelites,
when it was first set forth in the mount Sina. And the Gospell
of Christ was new when it was first declared in the worlde by
the Apostles. But the lawe was now new, when by the care
of godly kinges it was restored and renued, after that it hadde
bene once corrupt. The histories of the kings, Asa, Hezechias,
and of Iosias bée well knowne. Neither was the doctrine of the
Prophets new, when they did rebuke the corruptnesse of the
lawish religion, and requireth the right and true obseruation
of Gods lawe, although it séemed neuer so new and straunge.

                  By whose fault the doctrine of Christ seemeth
now new to the Papists.
                  What time as the booke of the lawe was found in the dayes
of king Iosias, in the secret corner of the temple, and was exhibited
vnto the king himselfe, it might haue séemed some newe
thing vnto them which had liued a great while without lawe:
where ind

the Gentiles. Compare héere with all those things which are
betided vs. Hath not the holy Bible bene hidden and cast into

what time it is translated into all languages well néere, & set

foorth commonly to be read, is it anye otherwise taken of y• superstitious
Papists, then if there were some new & vnknowne
doctrine thrust into ye Churches? You might haue foūd in times

of christen people would knowledge it, & say with Iosias, Go
aske counsell of the Lord for vs, and for our people, for ye Lords
anger is greate ouer vs, because our Fathers hearde not the
wordes of this booke, and that they woulde not onely acknowledge
their fault, but also with a godly & holy endeuour, renue
and set vp againe the decaied religion, according vnto y• Lords
word, and in so doing, they shuld turne away the Lords wrath
from themselues, and from their people, &c.

                  A declaration of the olde and new Testament.
                  New Testament is as much to say, as a new couenant, The
olde Testament is an olde temporall couenaunt, made
betwéene God and the carnall children of Abraham, Isaac, and
Iacob, otherwise called Israel, vpon the déedes and obseruing of
a temporall lawe, where the rewarde of kéeping is temporall
life, and prosperitie in the land of Canaan, and the breaking, is
reward with temporall death and punishment. But the newe
testament is an euerlasting couenaunt made vnto the chrildren
of God, through faith in Christ, vpon the seruing of Christ.
                  Where eternall lyfe is promised to all that beléeue, and death
to all that are vnbeléeuing. My déeds if I kéepe the lawe, are rewarded
with the temporall promises of this life. But I beleeue
in Christ, Christs déeds hath purchased for me, the eternal promise
of euerlasting life. If I commit nothing worthy of death,
I deserue for my reward that no man kil me
                        •
                      If I hurt no mā,
I am worthy that no man hurt me: If I helpe my neighbour,
I am worthy he helpe me againe. So that with outwarde
works, with which I serue other men, I deserue that other mē
doe like to me in this world: and they extend no farther. But
Christs déeds extend to life euerlasting vnto all that beléeue,

marry her who would. This fact of his is excused by Eusebius.

                  When the Church was yet springing, as Eusebius testifieth in
his. 3. booke of his history, the. 26. chapter, the Nicholaites did
openly and manifestly commit fornication, and layde the custome
of their wicked crime to Nicholas the deacon: although
Clemens Bishop of Alexandria in Stromatis no excuse Nicholas: for he saith that he neuer thought or taught any such thing.
But hauing a faire woman to his wife, and therefore béeing
thought to haue bene gelous ouer her, he brought her forth before
the people, and sayd: This is my wife, and that ye might
vnderstand that I am not gelous ouer her, I am content for
my part that any of you take her to wife, which thing also hee
meant, as farre as the lawes of God would suffer. But they
which were afterwarde called Nicholaites, vnderstandinge his
wordes peruersly, supposed, that the wiues amonge Christians
ought to be common.

which euerie one conteined. 3. houres, which he confirmeth also
by the testimonies of the holy Scriptures. For it is sayd, that
the Lord came vnto the Apostles in the. 4. watch of the night,
when they laboured so vehemently in the sea, that their Ship
was verie néere sunke. The same Father writeth the like thing
vpon the. 79. Psalme. The glose also in the Decrées. 1. question.

                  The definition of Obedience.
                  WE may make a definition of Obedience by y• very
word it selfe, which is called in Gréeke, Lakai.
And is nothing els but a faithfull submission of
minde, wherby the word, & will of the commaunder
is obeyed, when both the heart and eares be
attent vnto his words and will, & those things
which be commaunded according to their abilitie be accomplished
without any gain-saieng. For true obedience must haue
not onely an obedient hand, but a following will also. Wherefore
they cannot be counted for obedient, in whom the definition
of true obedience taketh not place, such as they be, which doe
obey in fact onely without the redy wil of minde, or els in word
or eare onely, without doing it when they may. For when the
thing cannot be done, the will to obey is reputed for the doing.
And so we say most commonly, that God accepteth our good wil
in steede of the fact.

Mans inuention, mans dreames or traditions? Nay verely, but
GODS holy wordes, his blessed Commaundements, yea,

the daies, he vnderstandeth Sabboths and new Moones: by
the months, the first & seuenth month: by the times, Whitsontide,
Easter, and the feast of Tabernacles: by the yeres he vnderstandeth
the yeares of Iubely or of forgiuenesse. It is not
ment, but that we may well kéepe certaine daies, not that one
is holier then another, but that we may haue time to come together,
both to preach and to heare the worde of God, offering
with one accord, our common supplications vnto him.

               OFFENCE.
               
                  Of three manner of offences.
                  SOme kinde of offences are to be eschewed, which take
their differences of their causes. There is one kinde of offence,
that riseth of euill doctrine, & corrupting the doctrine of
the Church. He y• after this manner is an offence vnto others,

followeth the steps of the Diuell his father, who ouerthrew the
first man and woman with this kinde of stumbling block. Gen.
3. Another kinde of offence, is that which springeth of euil manners,
that is to wit, when other folkes regarding thée, do counterfaite
thy euill conditions. He that on this wise is an offence
to man, buildeth vp the kingdome of Satan, and ouerthroweth
the kingdome of Christ. The third kinde of offence, riseth of the
abuse of things, which of their owne nature are indifferent,
which must be shunned, y• the weak be not offended: The wilfull
and vngodly, are to be despised, and for warrant thereof, we
haue Christs example.
               
               
                  Of an offence giuen, and an offence taken.
                  An offence is giuen then, when by thy fault, by thy importunitie
I say, & thy lightnesse, thou either dost or saist a thing, for
which thy brother hath a cause to be offended. The other offence
is not giuen, but taken or picked out, not by thy faults, but
by the works or wickednesse of another man: As for example:
when thou doest sinne neither in worde nor déede, when thy
déedes are nothing insolent, nor thy words vnseasonable, when
thou saist or doest the thing that is frée and lawfull for thée to
say & do, and yet another taketh Pepper in nose, and is offended
with that libertie of thine. Which is all one, as if a man that
walketh in a plaine path should 
                        •
                     ap to trip or stumble, and presently quarrell with his companion, as though he had laide a
blocke in his way.
Bullinger. fo. 451.
                  
                  ¶To giue offence is a great sinne. For Christ doth saye,
Woe vnto the world because of offences. It must néedes be that
offences come, but woe to the man by whom the offence commeth.
Whosoeuer offendeth one of these little ones, &c. Saint
Paule also speaking to the bretheren that giue offence, saith:
Through thy giuing of offence, perisheth thy brother, for whom
Christ died, and so ye sinning against your bretheren, and wounding
their weake consciences, doe sinne against Christ himselfe.
Bullinger. fol. 452.
                  
               
               
                  What it is to be offended in Christ.
                  Happy is he, that is not offended by me. ¶To be offended
in Christ, is to will neither to knowe Christ, nor yet to beleeue
in him. And not to bée offended in him, is to receiue
him, and knowledge by a perfect faith, that he is our Sauiour.
                  
                     ¶Happy is he, &c. That take no occasion by Christ to be hindered
from the Gospell.

                  How a man may offend God, and not his
owne conscience.
                  When Paule and Barnabas (men elect to be Apostles by the
reuealation of the holy Ghost, as it is written in the second of
the Acts) fell out one with another for Iohn Marke (as it is in
the 15. of the Acts) insomuch as the one forsooke the others company:
it cannot be denied, but either Paule, or Barnabas, or
both, were in a great fault to fall out for such a trifle, and yet
there was neither of them both, but he thought in his conscience
that he did well, and did contend for the glory of God. So
vndoubtedly, the most circumspect men in their liuing and most
studious to doe all their workes, and to vtter all their words to
the glory of God: yet oftentimes they shall conceiue in theyr
thoughts, wish in their hearts, and also speake and doe such
things, as shall be very great sinnes in the sight of God, and yet
they shall not offend their conscience, nor think they doe amisse.
And therefore the Prophet Dauid desireth almightie God not
onely to forgiue him all such and secret hid sinnes, wherein hée
had offended the most pure and perfect lawe of God, but also
he desireth him vtterly to pourge him of all his secret and subtill
sinnes, saieng: Ab occultis meis munda me: vnto this place
of the Prophet, séemeth the saieng of Saint Paule to agree very
well, when he saith: Nihil mihi conscius sum. sed non in
hoc iustificatus sum. Mine owne conscience accuseth me of no
fault, and yet I am not because of that iustified before God, for
we sinne vpon a good intent, and so by ignoraunce commit great
offence against God. In all such cases, a man offendeth not
his owne conscience, and yet he offendeth God.

                  What Offerings did signifie vnto the people.
                  THe Offerings were signes, and did certefie a man that God
was at one with him, and was his friend and loued him.
For the fat of the beast was offered and wine thereto, as though
God had sate and eate and dronke with them, and the rest, they
and their housholds did eate before God, as though they had
eaten and dronken with God, and were commaunded to bée

merry & to make good chéere, full certified that God was at one
with them, and had forgotten all olde offences, and now loued
them, that he woulde fulfill all his promises of mercie with
them.

                  ANd make of them holy annoynting Oyle.Ex. 30. 25 ¶This holy
annoynting Oyle doth figure the vertue of the Holy ghost,
declared or shewed by the word of God, and descending downe,
first on the head of Aaron which is Christ, and consequently
vpon the Apostles, and all the faithfull. As Psalme. 133. 2.

                  The Oyle of gladnesse, is the gifte of the spirite of God,
gladnesse to our selues, because it filleth vs with ioye in the
Lord, and gladnesse to other, because it powreth grace into our
lippes, to comforte the weake hearted, and to make vs a
swéete sauour of lyfe vnto lyfe, to all that hearken vnto vs.

                  Of the Oyle that Saint Iames
speaketh off.
                  Annoynt him with Oyle in the name of the Lord.Iam. 5. 14. ¶Among
those Nations vnto which S. Iames wrote this Epistle, it was
the manner to annoynt their bodye with Oyle, which thing
Christ commaundeth his Apostle to doe. And Oyle is to manye
diseases, as a wholesome medicine. We, where such annoynting
is not vsed, maye vnder the name of Oyle vnderstande
the Office and duetie of Charitie, in ministring

vnto the sicke, such things as he néedeth.
Tindale.
                  
                  ¶Oyle was much vsed in Palestina, and was counted medicinable.
Mark. 6. 13. Luke. 10. 34. Therefore where the Apostles
doth commaund that Elders should annoynt with Oyle, the
bodies of the sicke, his meaning is, that they shall in no wise
despise those meanes that God hath appointed, naturally to be
vsed, for the healing of the sicke.
Sir. I. Cheeke.
                  
                  ¶The Oyle that S. Iames speaketh of, was not a necessary
Sacrament of the Church to continue for euer, but it was a
miraculous gifte of healing, lasting for the time, lyke as other
miracles did.
Iewel.
                  
                  And they annointed many with Oyle that were sicke,Mar. 6. 13 and
healed them. ¶This oyle was a signe of this miraculous working,
and not a medicine to heale diseases: so that the gifte of
miracles ceasing, the ceremonie is to no vse.
               
               
                  How the Oyle that the Papists doe vse, came
not from the Apostles.
                  The Apostles in olde time gaue the Holy ghost by laieng on
of hands,Pauor. de cons. ca. 5 but now a daies because Bishops he not so holy, order
hath bene taken, that they should giue this Sacrament with
Chrisme.
Iewel.
                  
                  ¶Extreme vnction (as they tearme it) was that Ceremonie
which the Apostles, vsed oftentimes when they healed the sick,
annoynting thē with Oyle. For as they laied their hands vpon
those whom they baptised, giuing to them the Holy ghost visibly:
so lykewise when they healed any sicke man, they did eftsoones
annoint him with Oyle, to signifie vnto him, from whence the
gift of health did come, that is, from the Holy ghost.

                     Cyrillus
                     Cyrillus writing of the Oile, saith thus: Beware thou think
not this to be Oyle onely. For as the bread of the Sacrament,
after the inuocation of the Holy ghost, is no longer common
bread, but the body of Christ: so this holy Oyle is no longer
bare or common Oyle, but it is the grace of Christ. ¶By these
words there appeareth lyke chaunge in the Oyle and bread: For
as the Oyle is the grace of God, so is the bread the bodye of
Christ: and as the nature and substaunce of the Oyle remaineth

still, although it be not bare or common oyle, so the nature
and substaunce of bread remaineth still, although it be not common
or bare bread.

                     Chrisostome saith:Chriso in Epist. ad Gal. ca. 3. (they sayd) Who so stayeth himselfe by

whosoeuer stayeth himselfe by onely faith, he is blessed.

that not onely without the Ceremoniall workes, which did not
giue grace, but also without the workes of the Morall commandements,

workes of the righteousnesse, that we haue wrought. The reason
is presumed that we are saued for our merites, the which
he excludeth when he saith, Not of the workes of the righteousnesse,
which we haue done: but the true reason is, the onely
mercie of God. There is not therefore in them the hope of iustifitation,
Sed in sola fide, but in faith onely. Workes are not
the cause that any body is iust before God, but they are rather
the executions and the ministring of righteousnesse. In this
point (though he swarue from the truth in many other points)

                  Our Aduersaries,Musculus when they doe teach that the iustifieng of
vs doth not consist in faith onely, but in workes also, what doe
they els, but obscure the glory of Gods grace, and extoll the merite
of our workes. They doe not waye that it is necessarye,
that our iustifieng doe consist in faith onely, for as much as
it is bestowed freely. If they cannot abide the word onely, or
alone, let him leaue it, and vse this word fréely. For in case
we be iustified fréely by faith, as the Apostle doeth testifie, it
must néedes followe, that we be not iustified by faith & works,
but by faith onely. If it be not by faith onely, but by workes
withall, then is it not freely, but of duetie. If it be of dutie and
not fréely, then there is no glory of Gods grace at all.

that Christ was a creature, & the Holy ghost a like, that
the soules were first in heauen, & came downe into the bodies,
as it wer into prison, that in the end, the diuels should be saued.
Epiphanius as I read in Socrates (Eccl. hist. li. 6. ca. 11.) was become
the enimy of Origen, through the spite & malice of Theophilus,
Bishop of Alexandria. The diuell bare Origen a displesure,
he procured heretikes to father vpon him lewd opinions.
He complaineth himselfe in a certaine Epistle, how that Heretikes
corrupted his works. Pamphilus Martir the great friend
and familiar of Eusebius wrote an Apologie in his behalfe.
Eusebius (li. 6. ca. 3. 18. 20. 26.) reporteth of the famous men
that fauored Origen. Socrates (Eccle. histor. lib. 6. cap. 12.) writeth

testimonie. Chrisostome would in no wise bée brought to
condemne either Origen or his works.

               OTH.
               
                  What an Oth is.
                  AN Oth is the calling or taking to witnesse of Gods name,
to confirme the truth of that we saye, &c.
Bullinger.
fol. 132.
                  
                  An Oth is a way or meane, whereby contreuersies are ended,
and promises perfourmed, by the calling vpon the name of
God. For it is written in the Lawe, If a man deliuer vnto
his neighbour, Oxe, or Asse, or Shéepe to pasture, and it dye or
be hurt, or driuen away (no man séeing it) then shall an Oth
of the Lord goe betweene them, and he shall sweare whether

he hath put any hand to the taking away of his neighbors goods
or not. And the owner of the goods shall receiue the Oth. And
if he by the Oth that he hath taken saith, that he hath put no
hand to it, then shall he not make it good, &c. And this must bée
done before the Gods, that is to saye, before the Iudges and
Magistrates.
                  ¶An Oth is also a meane whereby promises are performed,
as in Gen. 21. where Abraham sware to Abimelch y• he wold
neither hurt him nor his posteritie, and performed it indéed.
               
               
                  How an Oth is lawfull.
                  Lawfull it is for the Magistrate, when they put any man
in office, to take an Oth of him, that he shall be true, diligent,
and faithfull therein, as Iacob for the commoditie and profit of
his posteritie, tooke an Oth of Laban the Idolater. Lykewise
Iudas Machabeus of the Romanes for the same purpose.
Also Princes may demaund an Oth of their Subiects & Commons,
for the sauegard of their lands and people. But they that
sweare must haue these properties, They béeing required of
the Magistrate, must sweare truly, minding neither fraude or
deceipt, but witnesse onely the truth, séeking no parcialitie but
the truth, not themselues, but the glory of God, the profite of
of theyr neighbour, and the Common wealth of GODS
people.
               
               
                  How an Oth is damnable.
                  To sweare to doe euill, as to slaye, to rauish, or to robbe,
is damnable without faile, and to performe such an Oth, or to
doe those wickednesses indéede, is a double damnation, both to
him that so sweareth, and also to the Iudge that causeth him
to sweare.Mat. 14. 9. Such an Oth was the cursed Oth that King Herod
made vnto the Daughter of Herodias his harlot, for the heade
of holy Iohn Baptist, whome Christ calleth a wily Foxe for his
craftie conueyaunce. A colour was this Oth of his cruell Tyranny,
and a cloake to his most spitefull murder. For through
that meanes was Iohn done to death. Neither was an Oth
ordeined after the minde of Saint Austen,
                     Augu, ad Seuerum Milenita. to binde the
perfourmaunce of man-slaughter, robberie, Idolatry, or other
sinnes. Rather had Dauid breake his Oth, then to fulfil it with
bloudshedding.
                  Wheras Dauid did not by shedding of bloud performe his promise

bound with an Oth,1. Reg. 25. 31. therein his godlines was the greater.
Dauid sware rashly, but vpon better and godly aduise, he performed
not the thing he had sworne. By this and by like
it is declared, that many Othes are not to be obserued. Now,
he that sweareth so, doth sinne, but in chaunging his Oth, hée
doth very well. He that chaungeth not such an oth, committeth
a double sinne: First, for swearing as he ought not, and then
for doing that he should not.
Bullinger. fol. 134.
                  
               
               
                  How wicked Othes & vowes are to be broken.
                  Othes are to be obserued, when their ende is not euill, nor
to the hinderaunce of soules health. In which promises (sayth
Isidore) let faithfulnesse haue place. In filthie vowes, chaunge
thy decréed purpose. Doe not the thing in effect that thou hast
without consideration sworne vnto, for the promise is euermore
wicked, that cannot be done without sinne. Therefore if the
Iudges or Rulers, should inforce the inferiour subiect to sweare
to the things that were against soules health or Gods honour,
as to worship an Idol, or to an Innocents vndoing, they ought
rather to dye, then to obey: as did Eleazarus, with the seauen
faithful bretheren and their mother in the Machabees, for much
better it is (saith Saint Peter) in such a cause to obey God then
man.
               
               
                  Of Herodes wicked Oth.
                  Neuerthelesse for his Oth sake, &c.Mat. 14. 9. ¶Better it is otherwhises
to forswere himselfe, then to do any vngodly thing. This
déede of Herod, can in no wise be excused, for if she had asked
his owne head, or hir mothers head, he would not haue graunted
hir.

                  How Othes first began.
                  When the Lawe of naturall loue (which God had inwardly
written in the hearts of men) remained among the
good fathers, Adam, Seth, Enoch, Noe, Abraham, Moses, & other
godly men, then was no swearing, but euery man did vnto his
neighbour, as he would his neighbour should doe vnto him.
But when the wicked, as Cain, the filthie Giaunts, Nymroth,
Cham, and such lyke, beganne to increase in the lande,
they contrariwise (for want of that rule) fell into all manner
of abhominable sinnes, so that daylye more and more
great mischiefes increased. And as Ose the Prophette

complaineth, there was no faithfulnesse, no brotherly loue, no
truth among men, but bitternesse, lieng, manslaughter, thefte,
and adulterie hath gotten the ouer hand: In their dayly occupieng
was much falshood vsed, and that was thought well wonne
good, that was gotten by deceipt. Uery seldome in their bargaining
were promises perfourmed, & more seldome a great deale,
was faithfull honestie regarded. In processe of time therfore,
were very few or none beleeued, vnlesse they tooke God to witnesse
that the matter was true. Wherepon first of all came vp
the swearing of Othes among men, to confirme their sayeng
with.

               OTHONIEL.
               
                  How he was called the brother of Caleb.
                  THis Othoniel was,Iudic. 1. 13 called Calebs brother, to whom Caleb
gaue Achsa his daughter to wife for winning of Kari
                           •
                        h Sepliar,
that is the Citie of letters: which kinde of marriage was
forbidden by the lawe of Moses. Leuit. 18. Therefore Othoniel
did contrary to the lawe to marry his brothers daughter. To
this it is sayd, that Othoniel was the naturall sonne of Kenes,
which Kenes was brother to Caleb, which was the natural son
of Iephune. Now when Iephune the father of Caleb was dead,
Kenes married his mother, which afterwarde had the charge
of Caleb in bringing him vp, wherefore Caleb (notwithstanding
he was the naturall sonne of Iephune) was called the son
of Kenes, as in Iosua. 14. 6. So that Othoniel was Calebs nephew,
and might therefore marry his daughter by the lawe.
Othoniel is héere none otherwise called the brother of Caleb,
but as Loth was called the brother of Abraham, which indéed
was Abrahams brother sonne. As in Gen. 13. 8.

peculiar people, because that although all Nations are
his, yet of his onely mercie he chose them, to whome he would
commit his holy word and Sacraments, and among whom, he
would haue an open face of his Church. In this place S. Iohn
                     
calleth them not his owne, because they were his chosen, but
because they bare the name of his people, and the title of his
Church.

                     1. Cor. 9. 9. 
                     Israel,
thou shalt not mosell the Oxe that treadeth out
the corne in the flore of the barne, but forasmuch as he treadeth,
and as I might say, thresheth out the Wheate, so let him
eate of the best, and mosell him not. Now this proposition beeing
spoken litterally of the libertie that husbandmen ought to
shew to their threshing Oxen, Saint Paule doth drawe this
proposition to an allegorie sense: for where he had giuen a commandement
to the lay brethren to be curteous and liberall to
all them that did looke dilligently, and tooke paines to teach and
to instruct the congregation, he rendereth as it were a cause of
this his precept & law, by this place of the Scripture: Dicit non
Scriptura: Non alligabis os boui trituranti. Thou shalt not mosell
the Oxe that treadeth out thy corne: vnderstanding by the
Oxe, the Minister of Gods mysteries. It cannot be denied now
but this sentence: Non alligabis os boui trituranti, was first
spoken of the Oxe that tooke paines for the profit of the husbandman.
Séeing then God would the Oxe to liue of his labours?
How much more then by all right and reason behoueth
it them to liue liberally in this worlde, by whose paines other
men doe liue euerlastingly in the worlde to come: So that the
allegorie of this proposition, Non alligabis, hath a pretie quicke
and a vehement kinde of probation, to the purpose that Saint
Paule went about, more then the text spoke plainly, which is
this: That the Ministers of spiritual things, ought of duetie to
reape temporall things.

            Patience.
            
               
                  What true patience is.
                  THat which the latin Interpreters of the holy Scriptures
haue translated Patience, is in the Hebrue as much to say,
as farre from anger: as we may perceiue in the Prouerbs, and

in Ecclesiastes. In the Gréeke it is called Nouollone, which signifieth
sufferance & patience. Cicero in his booke De inuencione,
maketh a difference betwéene perseueraunce and patience:
And defineth perseuerance to be a stedfast and continuall abiding
in a matter well considered and weighed, and patience
to be a willing and long sufferaunce of harde and painefull
thinges for honesties sake and profite. So that perseueraunts
is the generall vertue, whereby we doe constantly abide and
procéede in all that which wée haue begunne, vppon some
good reason. And that Patience is a kinde of perseueraunce,
when wée doe willingly and constantly suffer thinges that
be harde, painefull, sorrowfull, and to our losse. I doe not
mislike this definition of Cicero. For euerye suffering of aduersitie
ought not straight to bée called Patience: for there
is no man in the worlde but that he suffereth many thinges,
which he would not doe, if hée could anye wise withstande it:
and yet we doe not call them all patience, lyke as we doe not
call them impatient neither, which doe suffer no aduersitie,
but doe susteine it with euill will and discontented minde.
Therefore lyke as vnto patience, there is requisite a willinge
sufferaunce, so it is vnpatiencie, when we doe vnwillinglye,
striuing and with anger suffer that which we doe suffer. And
he did vpon a good consideration put in the definitiō of patience
not onely the willing, but the long sufferaunce also of euils,
for the vertue of patience consisteth not onely in this, if the sufferaunce
bée willing but there is requisite also a constancye
in suffering. You shall finde manye that be willing to suffer
for a while, but they bée soone gone, and become impatient,
vnto them cannot be attributed true patience, which is of
that sorte that it must bée both willing and continuall. Lyke as
the fayth of them which doe beléeue for a time, and do shrinke
away at time of temptation, is not true fayth: nor their loue
true, which doe loue to daye, and hate to morowe, so it is no
true patience neither, if thou be patient for a season, and within
a while after do chaunge thy patience into impatiencie. The
truth of vertues cannot stand without constancie.
Musculus. fo. 522,

aduersitie, but the vertue is when they canne moderate themselues,
and holde such a measure, as they cease not to glorifie
God in the middest of all their miseries, nor be so ouercompred
and swallowed vp with sorrowe and anguish, as to quaile
altogether, but fight against their owne passions, vntill they
may be able to frame themselues to the good will of God, and
to say (as Iob doth) that he is righteous in all respects.

                  Of the painting of the virgin Mary,
and of Christ.
                  Some saye that Saint Luke did paint first the Image of
the virgin Mary, and did sette it foorth with liuely couloures,
and that Nichodemus (who came vnto our Sauiour Christ
by night) hadde the Image of Christ béeing crucified.
                  
                     And that also Agbarus the king of Edessenes did send a Painter
to Christ to bring his Image to him, and when hée coulde
not doe it, because of the exceeding great brightnesse of his face,
Christ himselfe tooke his cloth, that he would haue painted him
on, and did wipe his face therewith, and so gaue him in the
cloth, a liuely Image, or resemblaunce of his face, sending it to
Agbarus, who was desirous of it. The lyke say they did happen
vnto the Veronike when she did reach her fine cloth vnto our
sauiour Christ to drie his face with all, that did runne full of
sweate. All these things they father vpon Athanasius, which is
most false and vntrue. First, as touching S. Luke, it is not in
Scripture that euer he was a Painter, but that he was a Phisition,
Scripture maketh mention. And béeing a Phisition for
the body, he was afterward called to be a Phisition for ye soule.
And because that Luke of all other the Euangelists did sette
forth most liuely the strong fayth, humilitie and lowlinesse, & al
other heauenly vertues of the blessed virgin Mary: Some did
affirme that Luke painted out the virgin Marie. And as for the
storie of Agbarus and of the Veronike, if any such things had
bene done or wrought, the Euangelists would as well haue set
that forth as they did other things of smaller importaunce. They wrote of the Hem of Christs garment: but not a word of
this meruailous Image of Christs face. Therefore such vaine

with his bloude: The Pardons appoint an other price of purchase
in the bloud of Martyrs.Heb 10. 14 The Apostle sayth, that Christ
with one oblation made perfect for euer them that were sanctified.
The Pardons crye out to the contrarie, and saye, that
satifaction is made perfectly the bloude of Martyrs, which
otherwise were not sufficient Iohn sayth that all the Saints
washed their garments in the bloud of the Lambe:Apoc. 7. 14 The Pardons

killing & eating of a Lambe, partly to the end that the Church
might kéepe in memorie the benefit which God did for them in
the land of Aegypt, to be a testimonie of Gods good will towards
the faithfull, to be a tipe of Christ, and part

                  What a passion is.
                  WHatsoeuer moueth the minde in an vngodly desire is called
a passion, as malice, rancour, ire, enuie, ambition, couetousnesse,
lecherie, pride, hatred, studie of praise, studie of enuieng,
and such other, which stirre akd moue the minde out of his
naturall rest, to loue or to hate without reason & measure: As
when a body suffereth any torment, we say, we be in a passion:
So whē our minde suffreth any such inordinate desire, we haue
the mindes passion: And euery such motion of minde out of his
due course, is called a passion.

to prepare and arme their mindes against the boisterous tempests

Paule, to prophesie vnto him of his imprisonment and bonds,
that he should suffer at Hierusalem, where we haue also a good
example of constancie & stedfastnesse in Paule, which regarding

is now faine to commit himselfe to the rough waters of the
sea, where he was a long season in great perill and ieopardy of

he did send him a most friendly company, I meane Aristarcus

                  The saiengs of the two Apostles Paule and Iames are not
contrary,Iames. 2. 17 wheras Paule saith, a man is iustified without works,
and Iames sayth, faith without workes is in vaine. For Paule
speaketh of the works that goe before faith: Iames speaketh of
the works that follow after.

and Iames doe agrée in this sort. That whereas Abraham was
iustified by fayth without good workes, it is vnderstoode of the
workes that went before, for he was not made iust, for the
workes he did, but for faith onely. And héere it is meant of the
works which doe follow fayth, by which he was iustified the
more, wheras he was iust before by faith. Wherfore Paul sayth,
Abraham offered vp Isaac when he was proued. This oblation
was the worke and testimonie of his faith and iustice. This hée
writeth vpon the Epistle of Saint Iames. So that if the offering
of Isaac was the testimonie of the faith and iustice of Abraham,
than he was not iustified by it, but declared thereby to be iust.

least by any meanes after that I haue preached to other, I my
selfe should be reproued. ¶Whereas some doe gather of this
place, that Paule did mortifie in himself the fire of inconstancy,
by long fasting, and by beating and scourging of his body, it is
nothing so. For what néede had hée to 
                        •
                     ame his body with fasting,
when he was shut vp in prison and had nothing to eate,
either yet to beat and scourge his body, when he suffred stripes
inough of his enimies. S. Paule had the gift of continencie, as it
appeareth. 1. Cor. 7. I would (sayth he) that all men were as I
my selfe am, but euery man hath his proper gift of God, &c.
Then by these words Saint Paule doth meane, that he did subdue
and mortifie his body, for to liue according to the doctrine y•
he himselfe did teach, least be should be reproued of men when
they should sée him doe contrary, or contemne y• thing which he
taught other to doe.

I not to send on earth, but therfore came I with y• words of very
peace, to destroy the peace of this world. For sith the doctrine

it cannot be but debate must arise, euen amongest greatest

cruelty towards them y• they loue best, then leaue y• vices which
they haue bene accustomed vnto. And againe, those whome the

                  Because therefore that we are iustified by faith,Rom. 5. 1. we are at
peace with God, through our Lord Iesus Christ. ¶To be at
peace with God, is none other thing then to haue tranquility &
rest in our hearts to Godward, knowing assuredly ye we be accepted
of him, & do please him, which thing we finde by fayth
onely, in that it receiueth forgiuenesse of sinnes, & newnesse of
life euerlasting by mercy obteined at Christs hands. Our own
workes can bring no such tranquilitie, because they be vnsure,
and engender doubt, of which followeth desperation, and of it
dampnation, we are not ashamed of our hope, for we are sure
by the death of Christ that God loueth vs, and will bring our
hope to passe.
                  ¶By peace héere is meant that incredible and most constant
ioye of minde, when we are deliuered from all terrour of conscience,

is the fruit of faith.

                  What this word penaunce is, and how it was inuented.
                  PEnaunce is a word of their owne forging (meaning the Papists)
to deceiue vs withall, as many others are. In y• scripture
we finde Poenitentia, Repentaunce. Agite poenitentiam,
Doe repent. Poeniteat vos, Let it repent you. Metanoyte in
Gréeke, Forethinke you, or let it forethinke you. Of repentance
they haue made penaunce to blinde the people, & to make them
think y• they must take pain, & do some holy déeds to make satisfaction
for their sins, namely such as they inoine them. As thou
maist sée in the Chronicles, whē great kings & tyrants (which
with violence of sword conquered other kings lands, & slew all
that came to hand) came to themselues, and had conscience of
their wicked deeds, then ye Bishops coupled them, not to Christ,
but to the Pope, and preched the Pope vnto them, & made them
submit themselues and also their Realmes, vnto the holy Father
the Pope, and to take penaunce (as they call it) that is to
say, such Iniunctions, as the Pope and Bishops wold command
them to doe: to build Abbeyes, and to endow them with lyuelode,
to be prayed for, for euer. And to giue them exemptions, &
priuiledge & license, to do what they lust vnpunished, &c.

                  The most high penitenciarie Christ, when he gaue & defined
true penaunce or repentaunce, said: Goe & sinne no more. And
Ambrose saith: True penaunce is to cease from sinne. Our
Church maisters of penaunce, doe bring the word repentaunce
vnto that that the poore seduced people, doe think that they haue
repented sufficiently for their sins, in case they obserue the same

which was appointed them for their penaunce, according to the
number, manner, time and tide giuen them by their ghostly father:
although they neuer feele one iot of true repentaunce in
their hearts, nor yet did accomplish it in worke.

                  To doe penaunce, as Diuines speake, and to correct our life,
is to cast out of our minde, all the purpose and manner of our
liuing, those things which be contrary to the will of God, whether
we our selues receiued them by our affection and errour,
or whether they were deliuered vnto vs by some other men, as

to ensue those things, which are agréeable vnto the supreame
law, and most perfect reason, that is to say, vnto the minde of
God. So that he which before time did supersticiously worship
things created: let him now religiously worship only the true
liuing God: which before was periured, maye now keepe his
Oth, and performe those things wherevnto he is sworne: which
before was an homicide, may now abhorre from slaughter and
bloud: which before was a breaker of wedlocke & an vncleane
person, may now holde Matrimony in holy reuerence and lyue
chastly: which did hurt his bretheren with crafte and guiles,
may now abstaine from iniuries, and doe good to as many as
he is able to profite, &c.

which is in heauen. And yet héerby he meaneth not the perfection
that is in God and his Angells, but onely the perfection
that is required in man.

that I should be the same that God is,Hiero. ad Chr. cont. Pela. that there should be no
difference in perfection, betwéene me and my Lord the Creator,

there was neuer man, nor neuer shall be, who being in this
life, shall haue this perfection.

Paule say, As many of vs as be perfect &c. Heereto S. Hierom aunswereth thus, What then doe we think, or what ought we
to thinke, that be not perfect? We ought to confesse that we are
vnperfect, and that we haue not yet gotten, nor taken that perfection
that is required. This is the true wisedome of a man,

to know himselfe to be vnperfect. And as I might say, the perfection
of all iust men liuing in the flesh, is vnperfect.

safe, and yet were they contrary to the faith, taken and burned.
And least that holy Councell should séeme to doe anye thing,
wherein all their sect did not consent, they made this Antichristian
lawe in the 19. Session: Presens sancta Synadus, &c. This

graunted by the Emperour, by Kings or other Princes of the

earth, to any which either be heretikes or defamed of heresie, for

               PERMISSION.
               
                  Of Gods permission or suffering.
                  WE must note, that when either the Scriptures or Fathers,
doe séeme God to be the cause of sinne, this word permission
is not there so to be added, as though he only suffered men
to sinne, and by his prouidence or gouernment, wrought nothing
as concerning sinnes. Indéede he letteth them not, though
he can, but vseth them, and sheweth in them his might, and not
onely his patience which thing Augustin vnderstood right wel,
and disputed against Iulianus, he confuted that sentence, wher
it is sayd, that God suffereth sinne onely according to patience,
and proueth that his might is also therevnto to be added by the
words of Paule, who wrote vnto the Romanes: If God by much
patience haue suffered vessells of wrath prepared for destruction,
to shewe forth his anger, and to make knowen his might.
And vndoubtedly there are many things in the holy scripture,
which cannot alwaies be dissolued by the word of permission or
patience. For the heart of the King is said to be in the hand of
the Lord, so that he inclineth it, whether soeuer it pleaseth him.
And Iob testifieth that it was so done as God would. But as
touching the sinne of the first man, when yet nature was not viciated
& corrupted, we graunt y• the cause therof came from the
will of Adam, & suggestion of the Diuell, & we saye that God
permitted it, because when hée might haue withstood and letted
it, he would not doe it, but decreed to vse that sinne, to declare
his Iustice and goodnesse.

                     PErsecution is an obstinate pursuing to destroy,Mat 5. 10 by the which
there is no place of rest and quietnesse giuen: but the destruction
of Innocents is sought with all kinde of violence and
deceits.
Mar. vpon Math. fol. 81.
                  
                  They which doe follow vpon any man, for to be reuenged,
so that they make no ende of pursuing of him, nor leaue from
that which they had begun withal, be rightly called persecuters:
although that at length they be compelled to leaue off, contrary
to their determination and purpose, as it betideth to all
persecuters, which are at the last constrained whether they will
or not, to breake off the race and course of their persecution.
Some doe take the word of persecuting or pursuing, to be a ful
following or pursuing in all poynts. As when an Hound followeth
the Deare a drye foote vp hill and downe, through thick
and thinne, &c. Both senses be applyed to this word of persecuting.
The first is touched in Samuel. Saule sought or pursued
for Dauid euery day,1. Re. 23. 14. but the Lord did not deliuer him into
his handes. What is it els to séeke a man euery day to slay
him, but to persecute him continually? Of the second we doe
read in the same Chapter, where he saith:Ver. 23. But in case he doe
hyde him in the earth, I will search for him amongst or out of
all the thousands of Iuda. He meaneth that he will search for
Dauid diligently in euery corner, and that he will omit nothing
touching the persecution of him. And Dauid vsed this word
properly in the Psalme, saieng: I will persecute mine enimies
and ouertake them,Psa. 18. 37 I will not returne till they shrinke,
I will breake them so that they shall not be able to stand, they
shall fall vnder my féete. When he saith, I will persecute
mine enimies and ouertake them, he doth expresse the purpose
of them which doe persecute, which is bent to this ende, to ouertake
and catch them whom they doe persecute. And whereas
he doeth adde: I will not returne vntill they doe shrinke,
it declareth his earnest diligence and desire in the persecution
or following. And that poynt: I will breake them and crush
them together, that they shall not be able to stand, they shall fall
vnder my féete, expresseth the reuenge which the persecutour
entendeth to take vppon him when hée doeth persecute. And
these bée the partes of full and perfect persecution, continually

without ceasing, to persecute, to catch, and to reuenge.

                  How some persecution is iust, and some wrong.
                  If that be the true Church (saith Augustin) which suffereth
persecution, not that which doth it (so said the Donatist) let them
aske of the Apostle, what church Sara signified when the did persecute
hir hand-maid, for he saith that the frée woman our mother
the heauenly Hierusalem, that is to say, the true Church
of God, was figured in that woman which afflicted hir handmayd.
And a little after: Againe, I demaunde in case that the
good and holy doe persecute none, but onely suffer, whose saieng
suppose they that the same is in the Psalme, where we read: I
will persecute mine enimies, and ouertake them, and I will
not tourne till they shrinke. Therefore if we speake and acknowledge
the truth, that is a wrongfull persecution which
the vngodly maketh vpon the Church of Christ, and that persecution
is iust which the Church of Christ maketh against the
vngodly. Thus saith Augustine.

                  How the Church doth persecute.
                  The Church saith Augustine in the place before, doth persecute
by louing to reforme, and to call men backe from errour,
and to make them to profite in the truth. And it is like the persecution
of a louing mother, and not of a spitefull stepdame.
Such I would haue the Church persecution (saith Musculus)
when the rulers of the Church shall in the name of the Church
persecute, not the innocent, but the hurtful more politikely then
Church lyke. But whereas the false shepheards vnder pretence
of heresie and schisme doe persecute (not the Goates which they
cherish, but the true shéepe of Christ, which doe follow ye voice
of their onely shepheard, and doe abhorre the voice of straungers)
with banishment and out-lawe, prison, wrongfull iudgements,
snare, sword, faggot and fire, what shall we call it els,
but the tyranny of Antichrist: whereas Augustine sayd, that
is a wrongfull persecution which the vngodly maketh against
the Church of Christ, he might well haue added therevnto, and
that in ten times more wrongfull, which the malignant Church
worketh against the godly. But in his time, the Romish Tyranny
had not yet so openly set vp hir shamelesse head, to practise
all kinde of persecutions and publike oppressions of them

that would discent from them.

do it, and submittest thy selfe so to do, and therevpon goeth forth

the Apostles for his actiuitie and boldnesse aboue the other.
But that Peter had anys authoritie or rule ouer his bretheren
and fellow Apostles, is false & contrary to the Scripture. Christ
forbad it euen the last houre before his Passion, and in diuers
times before, and taught alway the contrary.

                  Of Peters confession.
                  When Peter had professed the very true confession of Christ
that he was the Sonne of God, Christ said to him: Thou
art Peter, and vpon this Rocke, I will build my Church, that
is to say, vpon the faith whereby thou hast confessed and acknowledged
me. And that Christ by this Rocke wherevpon he said, he would build his Church, did vnderstand and meane himselfe.
Saint Austen doth write in an Homely which he hath
written vpon this place, where he saith: If Christ would haue
layed the foundation of his Church vpon Peter, truly he would
haue said: Thou art Peter, & vpon thée wil I build my Church.
Christ is onely that proued corner stone, which as Daniel saith,
shall breake all the kingdomes of the world, and it selfe shall
endure for euer a stable and strong foundation of the kingdome
and congregation of Christ, which thing is also confirmed by
the Prophet Esay. And Saint Paule teaching the same doctrine,
saith: that we must be raised vp in this holy building of the
Church, not vpon Peter, but vpon the most strong foundation
of the Prophets and of the Apostles. And where as many might
chaunce to stomble at the stone, thinking that Christ during
the time of his béeing in earth was the foundation of the
Church, but when he was once lifted vp into heauen, he then
lefte Peter in his stead. Paule the Apostle teacheth the contrary
in especiall words when he saith:Peter not head of y• Church There can none other
foundation be layed, then that which is laied already, which is
Iesus Christ. And whereas some doe say, that Peter, or some

other Bishop of Rome is the foundation of the Church of Christendome,
is as false as God is true: for Saint Paule writing
to the Galathians, saith not that Peter was the foundation of
the Church of Christ, but calleth him a piller, as he called also
Iames and Iohn, making him equall, but not superiour.
Bar. Ochine.
                  
                  In the 16. chapter of Saint Mathew, the question beeing
put in generall of Christ to all his Apostles, what they thought
or iudged of him, Peter aunswering for them all, as he was alwayes ready to aunswere, said: Thou art Christ the sonne of
the lyuing God, to whom Iesus aunswered againe: Blessed be
thou Symon the sonne of Ionas, for flesh and bloud hath not reuealed
this vnto thée, but my father which is in heauen, & I say
vnto thée: Thou art Peter, and vpon this Rocke will I build
my Church, and the gates of Hell shall not preuayle against it.
That is to say, vpon this Rocke of thy confession of me to bée
the sonne of God, I will build my Church. For this faith containeth
the whole summarie of our faith and saluation. As it
is written. Rom. 10. The word of faith that wée doe preach,
is at hand, in thy mouth, and in thy heart. For if thou confesse
with my mouth our Lord Iesus Christ, and with thine heart
doe beléeue that God hath raised him from death to life, thou
shalt be saued, &c. And this confession being first vttered by
the mouth of Peter, vpon the same confession of his, and not vppon
the person of Peter, but vpon the faith, Christ hath builded
his Church. And what is the faith? This: thou art the son
of the liuing God. That is to saye, vpon this Rocke? That
is: Uppon this confession of Peter, &c. And with this saieng
of Chrisostome, all auncient Expositours doe agree. For if we
should expound that place that the Church is builded vpon the
person of Peter, wée shoulde put another foundation of the
Church then Christ, which is directlye against Saint Paule
saieng: No man may put any other foundation, but that which
is put already, which is Christ Iesus.

                  Thou art Peter, and vpon this Rocke which thou confessest,

vpon this Rocke which thou acknowledgest,Au. in his 13. Psa. vppon Mat. saieng: Thou
art Christ the sonne of the liuing God, I will build my Church.
I will build thée vppon me, and not me vpon thée. For men willing
to build vpon men, said: I am of Paule, I am of Apollo,
I holde of Cephas side, which is Peter: others that would not
build vpon Peter, but vpon the Rocke,Peter was not the Rocke sayd: I holde of Christ.
And the Apostle Paule, when he did knowe that he was chosen
and preferred, and Christ despised by some men, sayd: Is
Christ deuided? Was Paule crucified for you? Or were ye
baptised in the name of Paule? And as not in Paules name, no
more were ye baptised in the name of Peter, but in the name of
Christ, that Peter might be builded vppon the Rocke, and not
the Rocke vpon Peter. Againe, Saint Austen saith, Christ is
the Rocke, and that Petra the Rock is the principall name, and
that Petrus Peter, is deriued of Petra the Rocke. And not Petra
the Rocke, vpon Petrus Peter.

                  How Peter speaketh for all.
                  As Christ did not onely aske Peter, but all the rest of the
Apostles with him, when he said: but who say you that I am?
So also Peter made aunswere in the name of all the Apostles,
or els they all being demaunded shoulde euerye one haue aunswered
for themselues. But there was much communication
among them at sundrye times before, and they all
confessed with one accorde, that hee was the Sonne of
GOD, although Iudas with a lyuelye faith beléeued not
so. And Christ at an other time, asked all his Apostles.
Will you also departe? Peter onelye in the name
of the rest, made aunswere. Thou hast the wordes of

eternall lyfe, which thing is euident of the words that followe,
to whom shall we goe? We knowe and beléeued long agoe that
thou art Christ the son of the liuing God. Of a like sort he answered
in the name of them all, when he spake these wordes
                        •
                     
Thou art Christ the sonne of God. And because Peter in the
mouth of them all, confessed Christ to be the sonne of God: ye
must graunt that when Christ sayd: Thou art Peter, & vpon
this Rocke will I build my Church, that he spake not only to
Peter, but to them all, although it were in the name of Peter.
As though he had sayd, Peter onely is not the liuing Rocke,
but all such as following his example, verely beléeue & confesse
Christ to be the sonne of God, be liuely Rockes, which be builded

                     The Apostles faith in the dai of iudgement shal condemn the scribs and the pharesies with the rest of the number of the lewes for their incredulitie could ouercome thée, but I haue made a petition
or praier for thée, that thy faith shall neuer faile, not the
faith that thou beléeuest that I am the Sonne of God, for
so euery mans faith endeth, when this life endeth. Forasmuch
as faith properly, is only of those things which we see not,

soules shall enter into the celestiall ioye, prepared for vs in
Christ, we haue the very sight and fruition of that euerlasting
blisse, which we beléeued and hoped to come vnto, and therfore
when Christ saith to Peter, I haue praied that thy faith shall
neuer faile, it is ment of the confession that Peter made, when
he said: Thou art Christ the Sonne of God. This thy confession
Symon Peter, this thy faith shall neuer faile vnto the

that thou Symon Peter after thou shalt be throughly conuerted,I pray not for the world Iohn. 17. but for them whō thou hast giuen me

                     When Christ praied for Peter, that his faith should not faile
it did not follow therfore that he was Pope, and could not erre,
for he erred after that time, sundry times: and namely, when
he expressely denyed Christ the Sonne of God. But when
Christ perceiued Peters timerous boldnesse, that shortly after
he would shamefully denie him, to arme and strengthen
him against the temptation which should ensue, least the greatnesse
of the fault might hurle him downe into desperation, hée
sayd vnto him: Satan goeth about to sifte you lyke Chaffe, and
to vndoe and destroy you, yea, you had bene already vtterly
lost, if I had not praied for you, and for thée especially Peter by
name, that thy faith shoulde not faile, because thou wilt fall
fowler then the rest. And I knowe that God hath heard my
prayer. For although thou wilt denye me with thy mouth, yet
thou wilt not denye me with thy heart. Thou wilt sinne, but
sinne shall not raigne in thée, so that in thy heart thou shalt not
yéelde to naughtie temptations. I will suffer thée to haue a
foule fall, that by the meanes thereof, thy timerous boldnesse
may be brideled and rebuked. And againe, that after when
thou shalt come to thy selfe, and perceiue thine owne infirmitie,
thy heart shall be touched with compassion against those
that shall sinne, raising them vp with knowledge, and confirming
and boldening them with thine example.

                     Peters seate,Peters seat is no stoole or chayre (for what hath the
kingdome of God to doe with such baggage) but it is a spirituall
thing. Christ saith in the Gospell: The Scribes and
Pharesies sit in Moses seate, what was Moses seate there,
a Chayre, or a Temple, or the Church, or Synagogue of
the Lord? Nay verely, for Moses came neuer there. But
Moses seate was Moses Lawe and doctrine. Euen so Peters
seate, is Peters doctrine, the Gospell of Christ, which Peter
taught, and the same doctrine is Peters keyes. So that Peters
seate, Peters keyes, and Peters doctrine, is all one thing.
Now is Peters doctrine, Paules doctrine, and the doctrine of
all the twelue Apostles indifferently, for they taught all one
thing. Wherefore it followeth, that Peters keyes, and Peters
seate, be the keyes and seate of Paule also, and of all the
other. xij. Apostles, and are nothing saue the Gospell of Christ.
And thus as Peters doctrine is no better then Paules, but one
thing, euen so Peters seate is no greater nor higher, or holyer,
then the seate of the other xij. Peters seate now is Christs seate,
Christs Gospel on the which all the Apostles sate, and on which
this day sitteth they only which preach Christ truly. Wherfore,
as Antichrist preacheth not Christs doctrine (which is Christs
Gospell) he sitteth not on Peters seate, but on the seate of Satan,
whose Uicar he is, and on the seate of his owne lawes and ceremonies
and false doctrine, wherevnto he compelleth all men
with violence of sword.

the rest of the Apostles.
                  As Peter was Christs Uicar, euen so was Paule and the
other Apostles, and the one no lesse then the other. If it be true
that Saint Cipriane doeth write, which is also consenting to
Scripture. He saith thus: That Christ spake vnto Peter saieng:
I say (quoth our Sauiour) that thou art Peter, and vpon
this Rocke of stone shall I build my Congregation,Peters power. & the gates
of hell shal not ouercome it, to thée wil I giue the keyes of heauen
& what thing that thou binde on earth, the same shall bée
bound in heuen, & what thing soeuer thou shalt loose vpon earth,
shall be loosed in heauen also. And to him after his resurrection
doth Christ say: Feede my shéepe. And albeit he gaue equall
power vnto all his Apostles after his resurrection, and saith:
Lyke as my father sent me, doe I also sende you, take you the
Holy Ghost. If you shall retaine to any man his sinnes, they
shall be retained if you shall remitte to any man his sinnes,
to him they shall bée remitted. Neuerthelesse, because hée
woulde declare vnitie, he ordeined by his authoritie, the
originall of the same vnitie beginning of one. The other
Apostles truely were the same that Peter was, endued with
equall partaking, both of honour and authoritie, or

power, but the beginning commeth of one, that the congregation
shoulde be shewed to be one. These are the wordes of Cipriane
in a treatise called, De simplicitate prelatorum,
where you may sée that Christ made all the Apostles of equall
honour and like authoritie, notwithstanding because he would
testifie the vnitie of his Church or congregation, he spake it as
it were alonely to Peter, when he sayd: feede my shéepe, and
I shall giue thée Peter the keyes of heauen: but in so saieng,
though the words séeme spoken to Peter onlye, yet they were
spoken to him, in that he susteined the generall person of all
the Church, béeing as it were a common speaker for the same.
So that in speaking to him Christ spake vnto al other the Apostles,
vnto whom he gaue all the same authoritie that he gaue
to Peter, as you may sée both in the words of Cipriane, and also
the same is cléerely shewed of Saint Augustine in diuerse
places, but no where more plainly, then in a treatise called De
agone Christiano.

                  How Peter was neuer at Rome.
                  The mainteiners of the Popish kingdome do holde an opinion
that Peter came to Rome the second yeare of Claudius
the Emperour, and dwelt there. 25. yeares, by whose preaching
Rome was brought to the faith of Christ, as both Eusebius
and Saint Hierome hath written, say they. To this it is aunswered
thus.Peter was neuer at Rome. Plaine it is that Christ suffered vppon the
Crosse, the. 18. yeare of Tiberius the Emperour: who reigned
23. yeares. After him succéeded Gaius, & reigned foure yeares,
then followed after Claudius. Nowe then if Peter came to
Rome the second yeare of Claudius, it must néedes be graunted
that Peter came to Rome within a. 11. yeares after Christes
death. Againe on the other side it is plaine by the wordes of holy
Scripture, that Paule was not onely, not conuerted to the
fayth, when Christ suffered vpon the Crosse, but it appeareth
also that hée was not conuerted when Steuen was stoned, for
the Scripture is plaine that he kept their Garmentes which
stoned Steuen to death. This being so, Paule himselfe writeth
to the Galathians, that he came to Hierusalem. 17. yeares after
he was conuerted, and that then he founde Peter there, which
was at the least. 18. yers after the death of Christ. Thē if Peter
wer yet at Hierusalem. 18. yeares after Christ, howe can it bée
that he came to Rome the second yeare of Claudius, which (as
they say) was the. 11. yeare after Christs death. Furthermore,
Peter was at Hierusalem not onely. 18. yeares after the death
of Christ, but the same time also was he sent to preach the Gospell,
not to the Romanes, but to the Iewes. And it is to be beléeued
that he preched the Gospell among the Iewes. For when
Paule wrote to the Romanes, and saluted a greate manye there
by name, it is thought he would haue saluted Peter also, if
hée had then bene the chiefe Bishop there. Wherefore it is a
verie false lye, that the Papists historiograpers doe write, that
Peter was first Pope of Rome, and died there.

               PHARAO.
               
                  Whereof the word Pharao is deriued.
                  
                     AMbrose writeth that the name of Pharao was not a proper
name, but rather a surname of al y• kings of Aegipt: for at y•
time they wer al called Pharaos, as afterward they wer called
Ptolomei, when the Macedonians were the chiefe Lordes ouer
all, as the Romaine Emperours were called Caesars, or Augusti:
But wherehence that word was deriued at the beginning,
this we may by coniecture gather. This Hebrew word
Pharao amongest other thinges, signifieth to auenge, and especiall
in the coniugation, Hiphil. Wherefore I thinke that
the wise men of the Aegyptians, in those auncient times,
meant by that surname, to signifie what manner a thing,
the function & power of a king is, namely that, that the Prince
is the minister of God: who as Paule sayth to the Romanes,
Beareth the swoorde and is auenger agaynst those

that doe euill. Wherefore the king of Aegypt so often as hée
heard, that his might cal to memorie that the auenging of sins
and wicked factes perteined vnto his office: And the subiects
being terrified by that name, might be kept in true obedience:
if yet it may be admitted out of the Hebrew tongue to deriue
the Etimologie of an Aegyptian worde, &c.

                  Suppose that there were a Carter hauing many horses,
which is continually whipped forwarde, neither suffereth hée
them to stand still: They being driuen forwarde must néedes
moue: and as many as are whole and sound of legges goe vprightly:
but if there be any amongst them that haue lame or
diseased féete or legges, they also goe when they are whipped
forward, but yet slowly and euill fauouredly, for they halt, but
that halting should not be vnlesse they were driuen forward.
For when the horses stand still the halting is not perceiued,
but the beginning of halting, that is the disease of lamenesse of
the legges, the horses haue in themselues, and receiue it not
at the Carters hand. So God, forsomuch as he by his mightie
working perpetually moueth and stirreth vs vp, maketh vs to
light vppon diuerse occasions, which we (for that we are euill)
cannot vse well. But in this similitude, this difference ought
to be noted, that it lieth in the hand of God, by his liberal grace
and spirit, to deliuer vs from sinne graffed in vs by nature,
when it lyeth not in the power of the Carter to heale the diseased
féete of the horses, &c.

                  What the Pharesies were.
                  THe Pharises were among the Iewes certeine men, which
professed a forme of liuing more straight and deuout then
other of that people, and were therefore called by that name,
for Phares in the Hebrew tongue signifieth deuided. They
professed continence, virginitie, fast, and abstinence from meat,
twise in the sabboth daies. They slept onely vpon boords, some
vpon stones, or else on thornes, to kéepe them from stirring of
fleshly appetite. They ware in their foreheads scrowles of
parchment, wherein were written the tenne commaundements
giuē by God to Moses, which they called Philaterias. They had
in great reuerence their elders, insomuch that they would not
with a word displease thē. Notwithstanding they beleeued that
all
things happened by constellation, and yet tooke they not away
frée will from man. They affirmed that soules are immortall,
and that God shall come to iudgement. Héereby they
came into wonderfull credence with people, wherby they drew
to them great multitudes, and of them were diuerse good men,
among whom was Saint Paule, Nichodemus, and other, which
afterward were Christs Disciples, although the multitude taking
the profession for vaine glorie, peruerted that honest forme
of liuing into hypocrisie, deceiuing the people, whome Christ
sharpely rebuked, and declared their folly. And yet with some of
them (which by likelihood wer good men) he dined, & otherwise
vsed them familiarly.

                  As concerning the Pharises, Saduces, and Esses, read Iosephus

sectes among the people. The Pharises professed the more
surer knowledge of right and customes of the lawe, they were
had in great vneration and reuerence of the people, and they
gate vnto themselues the greatest part of dominion and rule.
Neither did they onely oppresse the people with the burden of
the prescript lawe, but also with their owne traditions, in the
which thing the Saduces were greatlye against them, as we
read in Iosephus. But they are deceiued which thinke them to
be so named of the diuision, as though they being seperated frō
the order of the common sort of people, might take a degree proper
vnto themselues. They were called also Pheruss

descention of the Iewes, there arose among them sundry sectes
and opinions in their religions, of which ther were thrée sorts.
The first were called Pharesei, that is segregate or chosen.
                  They vsed certeine constitutions of men beside the lawe of
Moses, by which they were segregate from the residue of
the people. They reputed themselues better then all other.
They obserued fained fastes, praied commonly in the stréetes,
that they might be séene and called maisters. Their learning
was somewhat better then the others, for they taught the immortalitie
after this life, & that God wold punish sin. They beléeued
also Messias to come, to saue such as beléeued, & to iudge
such as sinned.

Gloses, to the morall lawes, by which they corrupted the commaundements
of God, and maketh them no more Gods, and
their false fayth in the ceremonies, that the bare worke was a
sacrifice and a seruice to God, the significations lost, and opinion
of false righteousnesse in their praiers, fastings, and almes
déedes, that such works do iustifie men before God, and not that
God forgiueth sinne of his méere mercie, if a man beléeue,

repent, and promise to doe his vttermost to sinne no more.

                  Saint Austen sayth: If they which becalled Philosophers,
specially of Plato his sect, haue spoken ought that is true, and
appertinent to our fayth, we ought not only not to feare it, but
also to chalenge it as our owne, from them which are no right

owners of it. For like as the Aegyptians had not onely Idols
and greate burdens, which the Israelites did hate and flye,
but also vesselles, ornamentes, and goodly iewels of golde and
siluer, which the Israelites departing from Aegypt vnder the
coulour of borrowing stole priuely from them, not of theyr
owne minde, but by the commaundement of God to tourne
that to a better vse which the Aegyptians abused. So in the
doctrine of the Gentiles are not onely conteined superstitious
and feigned rites, with greate burdens of vaine labour,
all which wée Christians following Christ out from among
the vnbeléeuing Gentiles, shoulde detest and auoide, but
also much good learning méete to serue the truth, howe to
worshippe the eternall, and onely God.

               PILATE.
               
                  Of the Acts and death of this man.
                  THis man being ordeined President of Iudea, at his first
entrie to flatter Tiberius caused the Image of Caesar to
be brought into the Temple of Hierusalem, whereby rose a
great sedition, forsomuch as the Iewes being therewith grieuously
offended, offred themselues rather to the death, thē they
wold suffer any Image in y• temple, Pilate in like manner vsed
the treasure called Corbona, contrarie to the custome and

lawe of the Iewes, and because diuerse of the Iewes shewed
themselues, to be gréeued therewith, he beate and slew a great
number of them. And after the death of Christ (as witnesseth
Tertulian) Pilate wrote to Tiberius the Emperour, of the
death, vertue and miracles of Christ, who after he had published
the same in the Senate, would haue had Christ to be ascribed
and numbred among the Gods of the Romanes, but
the Senatours woulde not consent thereto in anye wise, because
that Pilate wrote to the Emperour and not to them. But
Tiberius continued in his sentence, & defēded on pain of death,
that no man should persecute the christen people. Pilate at the
last was commanded by Vitellius prouost of Surrey, to goe to
Rome, there to aunswere to certeine complaints, which should
be layde to his charge by the Iewes, for which accusations hée
was after deposed and banished to Lions in Fraunce, where (as
Eusebius saith) he slew himselfe.
                  ¶Of Pilate Iosephus writeth, hée succéeded Valerius Graccus
vnder Tiberius, and was deputie of Iudea ten yeares. About
the eight yeare of his gouernment he crucified Christ.
And two yeares after that being expired, he was put out of his
office by Vitellius deputie of Siria, for the innocent Samaritanes
that were slaine, an other béeing put in his place, and he
constrained to go to Rome to purge himselfe in the iudgement
of Caesar against the accusation of the Samaritanes. But before
he came to Rome, Tiberius was dead and Gaius appointed
in his roome. Under this Gaius (as Eusebius maketh mention
in his ecclesticall historie) Pilate slew himselfe.

                  Of Pilates wife.
                  His wyfe sent to him sayeng:Mat. 27. 18 Haue thou nothing to doe
with this iust man, for I haue suffered manye thinges this
daie in my sléepe because of him. ¶Onely Mathew maketh
mention of this thing concerning the wife of Pilate, which
was done when Pilate was sitting downe on his Tribunall
seate to giue iudgement of death against the Lorde (Haue
nothing to doe with that iust man,) As touching the Gréeke
text it is sayde, Thou hast nothing to doe with that iust
man. But the Hebrew text hath: Haue thou nothing to doe
with that iust man. Beholde and note héere how the innocency

of Christ deserued testimonie of euery one, namely, of Iudas, of
Pilate, of Pilates wife, of Anna, of the false witnesse, of the wise
men, of the Cananites, of the Samaritanes, of the Centurion,
and lastlye of the theese hanging on the Crosse. (For I haue
suffered manie thinges) although the meditation and studie
in the daye time might be occasion of this dreame, yet notwithstanding
it is without al doubt, that the wife of Pilate suffered
those torments not naturally (as many doe at this daie
oftentimes) but rather by singular instinct and motion of
God. Many haue thought that the Diuell suborned this woman,
and craftely couloured the matter in her, that hée might
staye the redemption of mankinde, the which is verye vnlikely
in all pointes, when as by the motion & prouocation of the Diuell,
the chiefe Priests and Scribes did so greatly séeke and desire
to destroye Christ. Therefore we must this rather thinke
of it, that the innocencie of Christ was proued by manye
meanes of God the Father, to the end that it might appeare,
that he died not for his owne, but for others sakes. And for
that cause he thought good to be absolued so oftentimes by the
mouth of Pilate, before hée was condempned, that in his innocent
dampnation there might appeare a lawfull satisfaction
for our sinnes. But Mathew very expresly and plainely setteth
forth the matter, least any man shoulde meruayle why
Pilate was so carefull and diligent to defend and contende in
the tumult of the people, for the lyfe of a contemned man.
And truely God constrained him, by the terrour of the dreame
which his wife suffered, to defend the innocencie of his sonne,
not that he might deliuer him from death, but onely to declare
that he was punished for other mens faultes. &c.

as if it should haue ben sayd, that all the inuentions of men, &
whatsoeuer came not out of the mouth of God, must be plucked
and rooted out and perish. But Christ rather had a respect vnto
men: so that these words are in effect, as if he should haue sayd:
that it is no meruaile that if the doctrine of saluation were
mortiferous and deadly to the reprobate, because they are alwayes
carried headlong into destruction. Wherefore we must
vnderstand those to be planted by ye hand of God, which by his
frée adoption are graffed in the trée of lyfe.

saith Christ vnto an other that would likewise follow him, but
desired first to goe & burie his father,Luke. 9. 62 let the dead bury the dead,
but come thou and shew or preach the kingdome of God. As

not haue. ¶Let good men heare this, and not be carefull:
for this he speaketh of the presence of his body. For according
to his maiestie, according to his prouidence, according to his
vnspeakable and inuisible grace, it is fulfilled that he said: I am
with you vnto the consummation of the world: But according
to the flesh that the word receiued: according to that he was
borne of a virgin: according to that he was taken of ye Iewes:
according to that he was nailed to the crosse: according to that
he was taken downe, and lapt in a shroud, & laide in a graue,
and rose againe and shewed himselfe: In this respect it is true
that he sayd, ye shall not euermore haue me with you.
                  ¶He speaketh of the presence of his bodie, when he saith: The
poore you shall alwaies haue with you, but me shal ye not haue
alwaies. For in respect of his maiestie, of his prouidence, and of
his vnspeakable grace, is that fulfilled which he spake: Beholde
I am with you alwaies vnto the end of the world: But
in respect of the flesh which the word tooke vpon it. In respect
that he was borne of a virgin: that he was taken by ye Iewes:
that he was nailed to the crosse: that he was wound in a shéet:
that he was laide into the sepulchre: that he was manifested in
the resurrection, you shall not haue me with you alwaies.
                  And why so? Because he was conuersaunt as touching
his bodelye presence fortie dayes with his Disciples,

and they accompanieng him, but not following him, he ascended
into heauen, and is not héere. For there he sitteth at ye right
hand of the Father. And he is héere, for he is not gone hence
in respect of the presence of his maiestie.

begotten of Christ, he must be Lord ouer all the rest, & supreme
head of the whole Church of Christ, which thing may be prooued
by that that Peter as the chiefe and most worthiest person,
speaketh alwaies first for them all, and amongst the rest, hee
was alwaies accompted and named first. Againe, in any ciuill
gouernaunce of man (where the common wealths be well ordered)
there is one supreame head, which dignitie of order, we sée
also obserued euen among brute beasts, for the Bées haue their
king, who gouerneth the baser sort of the common people, and
ouersée them to doe their duties. The Cranes haue one chiefe
guide, whome all the rest doe followe. The Shéepe also haue
their Shepheard, whose voice they know, and whom they follow,
and at whose Commaundement they be.
               
               
                  Aunswere.
                  If the first begotten among the Apostles, ought to be Lorde
ouer all the rest, then forasmuch as Andrew was called before
Peter to the office of an Apostle, Peter shuld not take the Lordship
away from him, which of right should haue a better title
vnto it. But truth it is, that Christ is the first begotten among
his bretheren, and he is onely the Lord of all. And the worthinesse
of his first begotten, which was shadowed in the first begotten
of the olde Testament, is fulfilled in Christ himselfe.
Now, because the kingdome of Christ is altogether spirituall,
he may be accounted greater, higher, & more excellent, not that
is first borne to Christ in this world, nor he that is richer or
more nobler after the flesh, nor he that is better learned: but
he that excelleth more in godlinesse, and hath receiued more
light and strength of the holy Ghost. And whereas Peter vsed
oftentimes to speak first because of his boldnesse, yet followeth

it not of that, that he had authoritie and dominion ouer the rest
of the Apostles. And where the Bées haue an head and gouernor,
yet it cannot be that one Bée should gouerne all Bées in the
world, but onely those that be in the same hiue. And one Crane
to be guide to. xx. or. xxx. Cranes, yet it is vnpossible that all the
Cranes in the world should followe this one Crane. So neither
can it be that one Bishoppe can haue the cure of all the
soules in the worlde: for experience teacheth, that when one
Shepheard hath the charge of a thousand shéepe, it is as much
as he is able to doe to féede so many and to order them well.
If he cannot rule a thousand, much lesse can he order 7. or 8.
thousand. So that by these reasons, the Bishop of Rome may
be gouernour of all the soules within his owne Diocesse, and
no further.
               
               
                  The. 2. reason.
                  As the Iewes in the old Testament had (by the wil of God)
one chiefe Priest aboue all other, so the Christen men now a
dayes must haue one Pope.
               
               
                  Aunswere.
                  The Iewes in those dayes were but a few, and all knit and
ioyned togethers in one narrow place, whereas now the Christians
be innumerable, and are dispersed throughout the whole
world, wherefore that thing which according to the will of God
was méete for them then (that is to say, that they should haue
one chiefe Priest in earth) cannot agrée now with vs in these
dayes. Nor the high Priesthood of the Iewes, shadowed not the
high Priesthood of the Bishop of Rome, but the high Priesthood
of Christ. Wherefore that high Priesthood of the Iewes after a
certaine time had an ende, Christ is the chiefe Priest, not after
the order of Aaron, but after the order of Melchisedech, not of
the tribe of Leuy, or of the stocke of Aaron, but of the Tribe of
Iuda, and of the stocke of Dauid. He was not chosen as other
chiefe Priests be chosen of other Priests, who doe not alwaies
chuse the best, but he was chosen of his eternall and heauenly
father, when he sayd: Thou art my sonne, this day haue I begotten
thée. And the other chiefe Priests were annointed with
a materiall Oyle, but Christ was annoynted with y• holy ghost.
And they had on such garments as Moses appointed by Gods
commaundement: but the apparel of Christ, was the whole company

of vertues. They offered incense and brute beastes, but
Christ offered himselfe vpon the Crosse. They entred into the
Holy of the holiest, but Christ entred into Heauen, and sitteth
now at the right hand of the eternall father, &c. So that Christ
was chiefe Priest after the order of Melchisedech, which was
much more excellent then was the order of Aaron. Bar. Ochin.
                  
               
               
                  The. 3. reason.
                  Unto thée will I giue the keyes of the kingdome of heauen

and whatsoeuer thou bindest in earth, shall be bound in Heauen,

                  When Christ,Math. 16. 19. as he had no worldly kingdome, euen so hée
spake of no worldly binding, but of binding of sinners. Christ
gaue his Disciples the keye of the knowledge of the Lawe of
God, to binde all sinners, and the keye of the promise, to loose
all that repent, and to let them into the mercie, that is layed vp
for vs in Christ.

                  All power is giuen me in heauen and earth,Math. 28. 20. goe ye therefore
and teach all Nations, baptising them in the name of the Father,
and of the Sonne, and of the Holy Ghost, teaching them
to kéepe all that I commaund you, and behold I am with you
vnto the worlds ende. Loe, saith the Pope, Christ hath all power
in heauen and earth without exception, therefore all power
is mine, & I am aboue all Kings and Emperours in temporall
iurisdiction, & they but my seruaunts, to kisse nor my féete onely,
but my. N. also if I list not to haue them stoope so low.

                  When Christ (as I said) because he had no temporall kingdome,
euen so he ment of no temporall power, but of power to
saue sinners, which the processe of the text declareth, by that he
saith: Goe ye therefore & teach and baptise, that is, preach this
power to all Nations, & wash them of their sins, through faith
in the promises made in my bloud.

                  The. 5. reason.
                  The Priesthood being translated,Heb. 7. 12. the law must néedes be translated
also, &c. Now saith y• Pope, y• priesthood is translated vnto

me, wherefore it pertaineth vnto me, to make lawes, and to
binde euery man.

                  The Epistle meaneth no such thing, but proueth euidently,
that the Ceremonies of Moses, must cease. For the Priest of
the olde Testament, must néedes haue bene of the Tribe of
Leuy, as Aaron was whose dutie for euer was the offering of
Sacrifices. Wherefore when that Priesthoode ceased, the Sacrifices
and ceremonies ceased also. Now that Priesthood ceased
in Christ, which was a Priest of the order of Melchisedech
and not of the order of Aaron, for then he must haue bene
of the Tribe of Leui, and that he was not, but of the Tribe of
Iuda, and of the séede of Dauid. Wherefore they that are
vnder Christs Priesthoode are not vnder the sacrifices or ceremonies.
And of this manner iuggle they with all the Scripture,
which falshoode least the laye men shoulde perceiue with
reading the processe of the text, is all their feare, whatsoeuer
they pretend.

God made two great lights, the Sunne & the Moone: therefore,
as much as the Sun is brighter then y• Moone, so much y• Pope
is greater then the Emperour. The Prophet saith, Behold the
face of thine annoynted: this saith the Pontificall, is a Bishops
prayer ouer the Popes Legate, when he knéeleth before
the Altar. Behold I send my messenger to prepare the way before
thy face, saith God by the Prophet Esay: the Pontificall,
this is a Prophecie fulfilled when the Popes Legate méeteth the
Emperour, to receiue him into any Citie. I haue found Dauid
my seruaunt, and annoynted him with holy Oyle. My Loue is
beautifull among the daughters of Hierusalem: this they apply
to Kings & Quéenes, when the Clergie receiueth them personally
into their Churches. The Prophet saith. Sprinkle me
Lord with Hisope, & I shall be cleane: that they apply to the
Priest sprinkling with holy water. Lift vp your heads O ye
gates, & ye euerlasting dores, lift vp your selues: that is, when

the Clearke openeth the Church dore, for the Priest to come in
with the Crosse on Palme Sunday. Ten thousand such applications
and expositions are in their bookes, such as no bedlem
man could deuise more vaine and foolish.

                     Iohannes de parisijs saith:Ioh. 10. 16 There shall be one flocke & one

néedes vnderstande it of some other Minister that ruleth in his

                     Hosius saith, It is so necessary a thing, that one onely man,
ouer rule the whole Church, that without the same the Church
cannot be one.
                  The Canonists say, It is plaine that therefore the Church is
one, because that in the whole vniuersall Church is one supreame
head, that is, the Pope.
                  They alledge S. Hieroms words to the same purpose: The
safetie of the Church hangeth of the worship of the high Priest,
meaning the Pope Peters successour. But S. Hierome meant
not thereby the Bishop of Rome, but euery seuerall Bishoppe
within his owne charge: euerye which Bishop he calleth the

to abhorre his owne pride. For in this be outragiously doth offend

onely appropriate to Christ. Summus Pontifex, maximus Pontifex,

how he dare be so bolde to vsurpe and take these great names

                  How the Pope is an Idoll.
                  And the Lord (saith Zachary
                     Zac. 11. 15) said vnto me: Take yet vnto
thée the instrument of a foolish Shepheard, for loe, I will rayse
vp a Shepheard in the lande, which shall not looke for the thing
that is lost, nor séeke the tender Lambes, nor heale that that
is hurt, nor féede that that standeth, but he shall eate the flesh of
the fat, and teare their clawes in péeces. O Idoll Shepheard
that leaueth the flocke. The sword shall be vpon his arme, and
vpon his right eye, his arme shall be cleane dried vp, & his right
eye shall be vtterly darkened. ¶Who exerciseth this tyranny
ouer the people, and the Princes too, eating them to the
bones, yea bones and all, deposing them, destroieng them, and

pilling their kingdomes with insatiable extortions, but y• Pope.
The Popish gloses ascribe it to Antichrist,The pope is an Idol but they describe
the Popes practises. A Pastor in the land (saith Lyra) that is,
Antichrist to rule therein, that shall not visite the forsaken, that
is, he shall doe no worke of godlinesse, but shall be of great crueltie
toward the iust, and therefore he saith, and shall eate the
flesh of the fat, that is by spoyling of their goods, and teare their
clawes in péeces by afflicting and killing them. Againe, what
Pastour may better be called an Idoll than this Antichrist the
Pope? That is called an Idoll (saith Lyra) that is worshipped
for God, and is not God. And so shall it be of Antichrist, that
shall sit in the Temple of God as though he were God. O Pastour
and Idoll (saith the Glose) thou art so wicked that thou
shalt not be called a worshipper of Idols, but shalt be called an
Idoll, while thou wilt be worshipped of men, who leaueth the
flocke to be deuoured of Beastes, that the Lorde had alwaies
kept. This Pastour shall therefore arise in Israel, because
the true Pastour had sayd, I will not féede you. This Pastour
by an other name, is called the Abhomination of desolation,
that shall sit in the Temple of God, as though he were
God. Therefore the sword of the Lord shall be vpon his right
arme, & vpon his right eye, that the force of him, & all y• bosting
of his might, might be dried vp & withered awaye, & the knowledge
that vnder a false name he promised to himselfe, shall be
                        •

brothers, be found vnprofitable and negligent in his workes,

                  How the Pope hath power ouer Angells.
                  The Pope (saith Felinus) hath Christs lieuetenauntship, not
onely ouer things in heauen, ouer things in earth, ouer things
in hell, but also ouer the AngellsAngels. both good and badde.

                  It is most certaine that the Pope is Uicar to the Prince
of this world,Viceregent. and the Diuell is said in the Gospell to be the
Prince of this world. Who doubteth then, but if the Pope bée
Uicar to the Prince of this world, he is Uiceregent to the Diuell:
and as Iesus Christ appeared to this world to vndoe the
workes of the Diuell, so likewise the Diuell hath made the
Pope, who is his Neatheard héere vpon earth, to appeare to the
world to vndoe the workes of Iesus Christ. And therefore the
Pope studieng diligently to obay the will of his Prince fully,
is forced dayly to be contrary to Iesus Christ, and what is this
but onely to be Antichrist.

                  THe word of God forgiueth sinnes,De poeni. dist. 1. ver bum Dei. the Priest is the iudge,
the Priest executeth his office, but he exerciseth no right
of power.
                  The Lord hath graunted the office of baptising to manye,Augu. de stal. Para.
but the power and authoritie in Baptisme to forgiue sinnes,
he hath reserued onely to himselfe. So saith Ambrose, it is our
part to remoue the stone from the graue,Ambr. de pen. li. 2 ca 7

                     It is not the ambassadour:Amb li. 9 Epist. 76 it is not the messenger, but the
Lord himselfe that hath saued the people: The Lord remaineth
alone. For no man can be partner with God in forgiuing sins.
This is Christs onely office, that hath taken away the sinnes
of the world. And yet is not the Priests office void of power.

                  But wée must beware of tumult and insurrection. The weapon
of a Christian man in this matter, ought to be the sword
of the spirite, which is Gods worde, and prayer coupled
with humilitie and due submission, and with heart ready rather
to dye, then to doe any vngodlinesse.

                  What Praier is.
                  PRaier is a mourning, a longing and a desire of the spirite
to God-ward, for that which she lacketh, as a sicke man
mourneth and sorroweth in his heart longing for health.

                  Againe, Praier is either a longing for the honour of the
name of God that all men should feare him and kéepe his precepts
and beléeue in him: either to giue God thankes for benefits

receiued: either a complaining and a shewing of thine
owne miserie and necessitie, or of thy neighbours before God,
desiring him with all the power of thine heart to haue compassion

the stedfastnesse of our beléefe, in the beautie of our desires, and
in the pure intentiue thought of our hearts, fixed on Gods diuine
mercie, at such time as we doe pray.
                  ¶God hath giuen vs a speciall comaundement to pray, promising
to heare and graunt our requests. Wherefore it is requisite
when we powre out our feruent praiers vnto God, that
we haue a speciall regard vnto the promise, for except the Lord

prayers. And whensoeuer we obtaine any thing in our prayer,
we may not attribute the graunt thereof to our praiers

that is to say the turning vnto God by godly and humble affection,
but we (saith Musculus) define it thus: that the praier
which may appeare vnto God, is the affection and bewayling
of an afflicted heart, wherby the ayd of God is most humbly
besought, whether the same be done with words or without
wordes, by wayling alone and sighes.

in true faith, and euermore to haue recourse to him in
all his néedes, and the rather to receiue his benefites with a
thankful mind, when he is certefied by prayer, that all benefits
doe come from his bountifull hande, and finally to confirme
weake mindes, so that they shall not haue cause to doubt in
Gods prouidence, when they sée God doth stirre them vp, yea,
doth commaund them to call vpon him in their necessities by
Iesus Christ, & doth promise them y• he will heare their prayers
through the same Iesus Christ, whensoeuer they call vppon
him, that they may render thankes vnto him, and glorifie his
holy name. Neither will God haue vs make our praiers without
his Temple, that is Iesus Christ his Sonne, in whom his
Deitie dwelleth effectually. For as he hath giuen vs our béeing
and the knowledge of him, by the meanes of his Sonne, so
will he likewise haue vs to aske of him by this meanes, & not
by any other. And therefore whosoeuer doth praye and offer
vp his petitions to any other then to God onely, or doth séeke

being, which may helpe vs to descend and to enter throughly
with our whole thought into our heart, promising to the affections
of our heart, that God shall be néere vs, whose Temples
our bodies ought to be. For he ment not to deny but that
it is expedient also to pray in other places: but he sheweth that
praier is a certaine secret thing, which both is chiefly placed in

sufficiently inough, that euen in his daies many of y• Christians
were so fallen backe to the superstitions of Temples &
Churches, not onely in seruices but in praiers also, that they

thought the prayers were more effectuall in Churches, then in

                  For if he had not hoped that they which were slaine should
rise againe,2. Mac. 12. 44. it had bene superfluous and vaine to praye for the
dead. ¶From this verse to the ende of this Chapter, the
Gréekes text is corrupt, so that no good sense, much lesse certain
doctrine can be gathered thereby. Also it is euident, that this
place was not written by the holy Ghost, both because it dissenteth
from the rest of the holy Scriptures, & also the Authour
of this booke acknowledging his own infirmitie, desired pardon
if he haue not attained to that he should. And it séemeth that
this Iason of Ceronean, out of whom he tooke this Abridgment,
is Ioseph Bengorion, who hath written in Hebrue. 5. bookes of
these matters, & intreting this place, maketh no mention of ye
praier for the dead. And though Iudas had so done, yet perticular
example is not sufficient to establish a doctrine, no more thē

                  Truly I thinke that Iudas beléeued that ther shuld be a resurrection,
as the text praised him saieng: Thinking well and denoutly
of the resurrection of our flesh, & they that beleeued wer
yet so rude & ignorant, that they thought they shuld rise but to
obtaine a carnall kingdome, and haue their enimies subdued
vnder them without rebellion. And thereto sticke the Iewes
vnto this day. And it is most lyke that this should be his meaning,
we shall all rise againe and possesse this lande in peace, &
these men which are slaine, are out of the fauour of God, because
they haue contrary to the lawe. Deut. 7. tooke of the Idolls oblations,
therefore it is best that we send a Sacrifice to Hierusalem
to pacifie ye wrath of God towards thē, lest when they rise
again, ye Lord shuld send some plague among vs for their transgression
which they committed while they were héere liuing. If
any man can better gesse, I am well content to admit it. But
this is plaine though, he thought that this sacrifice coulde not
helpe them, before they should rise againe, which doth fully destroy
Purgatory: for where he saith that it were void & vaine
to praye for the dead, except they shoulde rise againe, is euen
as much to say vnto him that hath any wit, as that this prayer
& sacrifices can doe them no good, before they be risen againe
frō death: for els wer it not in vaine to pray for them, although
they should neuer rise againe. As by this example, if I say to a
man, that he shall neuer obtaine his purpose, except he shuld sue
to the kings grace, it is euen as much to say to a man that hath
any wit, he shal neuer obtaine his purpose, before he hath su

were departed. But afterward it fell out by ye good zeale of the
Bishops, y• ther was a solemne remembrance kept of thē which
died in ye Lord, specially of Martirs, & ther were also sacrifices
offered, I meane of thanks-giuing, but they wer not done for ye
dead to auaile to their saluation, but for y• faithful y• wer aliue,
that their hearts might be the better confirmed in the faith of
Christ. Of these sacrifices, Cypriane maketh mention, how they
vsed to offer sacrifices for ye martirs, Laurētius, Ignatius & y• rest.

Wherefore it appeareth that they had not the same manner of
Sacrificing for the dead at that time, as it is now vsed in the
Popery. They did sacrifice for the Martyrs, but so that they did
not pray for them at all, as Augustine doth also testifie, so that
this sacrifice for the dead, had no praier for them ioyned withall,

                  Let these wordes (saith Cipriane) and praiers of such as
praie, be orderly gouerned, kéeping modestie & shamefastnesse.
Let vs thinke we stand in the sight of God.Praier stā
                        ding, kneeling, lieng, or sitting, is allowed in holy Scripture. God his eyes
must be delighted, both in the iesture of our bodyes and manner of our words. For as it is the part of an impudent person
to vse clamorous shoutes in praieng, so contrariwise, it beséemes a shamefast person, to praye with modest prayers.
                  Some foolishly imagine that praier is made either better or
worse, by the iesture of our bodyes. Therefore let them heare
Saint Austen. li. 2. ad Simplicianū. quest. 4. saieng. It skilleth
not after what sorte our bodyes be placed, so that the

minde béeing present with God, bring her purpose to passe.
For wée both praye standing as it is written, the Publicane
stoode a farre of: and knéeling, as we reade in the Acts of the
Apostles: And sitting as did Dauid and Helias: And vnlesse
we might praye lieng, it should not haue bene written in the
Psalmes, euery night wash I my bed. For when any man seeketh
to pray, he placeth the members of his bodye after such a
manner, as it shall séeme most méete vnto him for the time, so
stirre vp his deuotion.

                  To pray continually, how it is vnderstood.
                  There were a sort of heretiks Massaliani of their first Captaine
Massalianus, which vnder the pretence of long praieng,
did studye to liue idlely, and condempned all manner
workes and labour of the handes, alleadging for themselues
a great sorte of Scriptures, but speciallye this place of Saint
Paule: Orate sine intermissione, doe yée praye continnallye,1. Thes 5. 17 to
this they ioyned the example of the primitiue Church,Act. 12. which
when Saint Peter was 
                        •
                     ast in prison by Herode, prayer was
made without ceasing of the congregation vnto GOD for
him.Luke. 18. Also that our Sauiour Christ did teach his Disciples,
that they should alwayes praye and neuer cease. And also
that the Prophet Dauid sayth, I will alwayes praise the
Lorde,Continual praieng. euermore shall his praise bée in my mouth. Upon these
places did these heretikes ground their errours, which they
vnderstood not aright. For God hath set this generall order
for all men:Deut. 5. 13 Sixe dayes shalt thou worke and doe therin all
thy businesse, but vppon the seauenth daye thou shalt doe no
bodely labour, neither thou nor thy seruaunt, nor thy cattell,
for in sixe daies the Lorde made heauen and earth, the sea, and
all that therein is, and vpon the seauenth daye hée rested, and
so shalt thou. Saint Paule sayth, he that laboureth not,2. The. 3. 10 let him
not eate.1. Tim. 5. 8 And againe, if any prouide not for his owne, and specially
for them of his householde, the same hath denied the faith
and is worse then an Infidell. And so he commaundeth seruants
to bée seruable vnto their maisters, and to doe their
worke truely behinde their backes, as well as before their faces.
Now to declare y• true meaning of such scriptures as séemed
to make for the Massalians. S. Austen
                     Augustin. saith on this wise: All
such places of the Scriptures as seeme to commend continuall

praieng, are to be vnderstood of the learnedst, the feruent & perpetuall
desire that we ought to haue to praye, wherof we haue
an example in that holy widowe named Anne,
                     Luke. 2. 36 the daughter of
Phanuel: Quae non discedebat de Templo, ieiunijs ac deprecationibus

                           •
                        eruiens nocte ac die. In which wordes we must
graunt the tropicall speach called Hiperbole. For it cannot
bée auoided but that this holy woman did eate, drink, and was
sometime occupied about her necessarie businesse at home. But
because she was most commonly in the temple praieng, therefore
the Euangelist saith, that shée was there night and daye:
So that the Saints do fulfill this Scripture, praieng continually,
when they pray often and feruently to God.Question Long praier. And if anye
man now should aske this question, forasmuch as Christ hath
forbidden much babling in the time of praieng, whether do
they 
                        •
                     in or no, which do pray long. To this is answered thus:
In a case they sinne, and in a case they sinne not, but doe verye
well and godly. In case they put their trust in their long praieng,
thinking that therefore they shall be heard as the Gentiles
doe, then they sinne as they doe, and are condempned by
the sentence of Christ in the Gospell: But if they praye long
with feruent faith and true deuotion, then they sinne not: no
though they pray with often repeating of one praier: but they
folow ye example of Christ, which in mount Oliuete did oftentimes
repeate one praier, which in effect was none other but
this: Pater si possibile est, transeat a me calex iste. Wherefore
Saint Austen most holyly and truely maketh a distinction
betwixt Multum loqui, & multum precari: Much babling
and long praieng. To pray long with godly and deuout exercising
of the heart, it is a good thing: but to aske a good thing
with superfluous & an vnprofitable heape of wordes, the minde
not occupied, it is naught. And againe saith S. Austen: How
can any man condemne long praier, séeing that of Christ it is
written. Quod pernoctauit in orando, that he was occupied
all night in praier. But this doe I counsell saith Saint Austen,
Ad probam: Si quis nausiam, If any man supposeth lothsomenesse
to arise of long praieng, let him well consider, although
it be not long, yet often it is lawfull to pray And whatsoeuer
he be that so shall pray often, he shall neuerthelesse fulfill
the example of the Prophet Dauid, which saith to the prouoking

and teaching of all other men to praye often. Benedicam
Dominum in omni tempore, & semper laus 
                           •
                        ius in ore
meo: I will alwaies praise the Lord, and euermore shall his
praise be in my month.

                  What the praiers of Saints in the Apocalips meaneth.
                  And when he had taken the booke,Apoc. 5. 8. the foure beastes and
the. 24. elders fell downe before the lambe, hauing euerie one
harpes and golden Uialls full of odours, which are the praiers
of the Saints. And in an other place of the same booke he saith:
And an other Angell came and stoode before the altar,Apoc. 8. 3. hauing
a golden censour, and much of odours were giuen vnto him,
that he shuld offer the praiers of ye Saints vpon the gloden altar
which is before the throne. These places the Papists do alledge
for the inuocation of Saints.
               
               
                  Aunswere.
                  Ye must vnderstand that there be two kinde of praiers, the
one is inuocation or petition, & the other is giuing of thankes,
laude, and praise. The petition if néede were, might be proued
by the fourth Chapter of the Epistle to the Philippians. Wée
call that inuocation when we desire some good thing to bée giuen
vnto vs, or some euill to be taken away from vs. Giuing
of thanks doth conteine, the praising and lauding or magnifieng
of the name of God, for his excéeding great benefits which
we receiue daily and hourely at his hands. It is manifest by y•
which followeth that the Apostle doth speake of the last, and
not of the first. These be the words, and they song a new song,
saieng: Thou art worthy to take the booke, and to open ye seales
thereof, because thou wast killed and hast redéemed vs to God
by thy bloud, out of euerie kinred and tongue, and people, and
nation, and hast made vs vnto our God kings and Priests, &
we shall reigne on the earth. Now what doth this make for

the intercession of the blessed spirits or soules that the Saints
doe sing praises vnto God in heauen. In the other place is
meant none other but that the Angell did ioyne his laude
and praise which hée gaue vnto God with the Hymnes and
songs of the elect. Saint Austen expounding this place writeth
thus: Alius Angelus, ipse est Iesus Christus, &c. The other
Angell (sayth he) is Iesus Christ, hauing a golden censour,
which is an holy body: for the Lord himselfe was made a censour,
out of the which God receiued a swéete odour, and was
made mercifull vnto the worlde, for hée offered himselfe a sacrifice
of swéete smell, and the Angell did take the censour,
and did fill it with the fire of the altar. Iesus tooke a body that
is to say, the Church, and did fill it with the fire of the holye
Ghost.

speaketh not this of that kinde of prayer that is commonly
and dayly vsed of all faithfull,Married folkes. as well married as vnmarried,
but onely of the generall and solemne prayer of the whole
congregation, which then as in time of persecution and feare of
enimies was kept onely in the night: And all the whole multitude
of the faythfull was charged to be present at the same.
At which time it was necessarie, that both the man and the
woman should leaue the others companie and resort to prayer.

of praier, and to be offered vnto God for the preseruation of
the king. Therefore when ye do pray and say: The Lord heare
thée, vnderstand (for example) by this word (Thée) our king or
chiefe gouernour, and then the praier is plaine. And héere by the
way, note that the Prophet sayth, not as the olde superstition
was wont, our blessed Lady and all the whole companie of heuen
heare thée, for thē he had taught vs to cal vpon creatures,
which can neither heare vs nor helpe vs: but the Prophet as he

doth alwaies, so he doth héere teach vs to crie vnto God himselfe
in the day of trouble, And in that he saith the name of the
God of Iacob defend thée, it is nothing els to say, but the power
& the might of the most high omnipotent God of Iacob defend
thée.

               PREDESTINATION.
               
                  What Predestination is.
                  
                     PRedestination is Gods euerlasting and vnchaungeable ordinaunce,
going in order before all the causes of saluation
and dampnation, whereby God hath determined to bée
glorified, by some by sauing them of his owne méere grace in
Christ, and in other some by dampning them through his
rightfull iudgement in Adam, and in themselues. And
after the custome of the Scripture, we call the sormer sorte, the
vessells of glorye, and the elect or chosen, that is to saye, folkes
appointed to saluation before the world through mercye: And
the other sort we call reprobates or castawayes and vessells
of wrath, that is to saye appointed likewise to rightfull dampnation
from euerlasting, either of both which, GOD hath
knowne seuerally from time without beginning.
Theo. Beza.
                  
                  By the eternall Predestination of GOD, is vnderstoode
his eternall ordinaunce, whereby hée hath ordeined before
the creation of the worlde, that which hée hath determined
to doe with all men, to be glorified in them, as well in his
mercy, as in his iust iudgement. In his mercy he is glorified in
shewing, the riches of his glorie in his vessells of mercye,
which are his chosen, y• which he hath prepared to glory in the
iust iudgement, he is glorified in shewing his wrath, and giuing
to vnderstanding his power, after that he hath endured in
greate patience, the vessells of wrath prepared to perdition.
P. Viret.
                  
                  I thinke it best (with this definition) to begin with that
that the Logitians call (Quid nominis) what the worde signifieth.
The Grecians call Predestination Oûproris non, of
this Uerbe Cûporitas, which signifieth to determine and appoint
before. For Oros, is Terminus, that is a bande or limit.
Wherefore the elect are seperated a sunder from them
that are not elect, the Latine men call it Praedestinatio. For
Destinare is nothing else, but firmely to determine and constantly
to appoint anye thing in the minde, or by some firme
decrée of the minde to direct anye thing to some one end.
                  But Predestination which wée speake of, maye bée taken two
manner of wayes: either as touching the bringing of it to
the effect, as that Paule going to Damascus, was conuerted
to Christ, and by that meanes seperated from the vnbeléeuers:

Or inasmuch as it was with God from eternitie, before
men were borne. Of this Paule speaketh writing to the
Gala
                           •
                        hians,
                     Gal. 1. 15. that hée was sette aparte to preach the Gospell
from his mothers wombe, longe before hée was conuerted.
And vnto the Ephesians
                     Ephe. 1. 4. also he sayth, that we were predestinate
before the foundation of the worlde were layde.
                  And to the Romanes,
                     Rom. 9. 13 of the Twinnes he sayth: before they
hadde done either good or bad, Iacob haue I loued, and Esau
haue I hated. And we at this present speake of this eternall
Predestination of God. Wherefore the other is nothing
but a declaration of this. Predestination therefore maye bée
taken both commonly and properly. But forsomuch as God
doth all thinges by an appointed Counsell, and nothing by
chaunce or fortune, vndoubtedly whatsoeuer he createth or
doth, he appointeth to some ende and vse: After this manner
neither the wicked nor the Diuell himselfe, nor sinners canne
be excluded from Predestination, for all these things doth God
vse according to his will, &c.

                     Augustine
                     Augustin in his booke De Predestinatione sanctorum, the
10. Chapter, thus defineth Predestination, that it is, a preperation
of grace. And in the. 12. Chapter hée sayth, it is foreknowledge
and a preparation of the gifts of GOD, by which they
are certeinly deliuered which are deliuered: but the rest are
left in the masse and lumpe of perdition. In an other place
he calleth it the purpose of hauing mercye. The Maister of
the SentencesMaister of the sentence. in the first booke, Distinct. 40. defineth it to bée
a preparation of grace in this present time, and of glorye in
time to come. These definitions I reiect not. Howbeit because
they comprehende not the whole matter, I will bring
in an other definition more full, as nigh as I canne. I saye
therefore that Predestination is the most wise purpose
of GOD, whereby he hath before all eternitie constantlye
decréed, to call those whome hée hath loued in Christ to the adoption
of his children, to iustification by faith, and at length
to glorye through good workes, that they maye bée made lyke
to the Image of the sonne of God, and that as then should bée
declared the glorye and mercye of the creator. This definition

as I thinke comprehendeth all thinges that perteine vnto
the nature of Predestination, and all the partes thereof maye
be proued by Scripture.
Pet. Mart. vpon the Rom. fol. 292.
                  
                  Predestination wée call the eternall and immutable decrée
of God, by the which he hath once determined with himselfe
what hée will haue to bée done with euerye man. For he hath
not created all to bée of one condition. Or if we will haue the
definition of Predestination more large: wée saye that it is
the most wise & most iust purpose of God, by the which before
all times, hée constantly hath decréed to call those whome
hee hath loued in Christ, to the knowledge of himselfe, and
of his sonne Christ Iesus, that they maye bée assured of theyr
adoption, by the iustification of fayth, which working in them
by charitie, maketh their workes to shine before men, to the
glorie of their Father, so that they (made conforme to the Image
of the same God) maye finally receiue the glorye which
is prepared for the vessells of mercye. These latter partes (to
wit, of vocation, iustification of fayth, and of the effect of the
same) I haue added for such as thinke that wée imagine it sufficient that we bée predestinate, howe wickedlye soeuer wée
liue. We constantly affirme the playne contrarye, to wit,
that none liuing wickedly canne haue the assuraunce that he
is predestinate to lyfe euerlasting, yea, though man and Angell
woulde beare recorde with him, yet will his owne conscience
condempne him, vnto such time as he vnfeinedly turne
from his conuersation.

                  Who hath predestinate vs to the adoption of children by Iesus
Christ.Ephe. 1. 5. ¶This is the true vnderstanding of Predestination,
that without anye merites or deseruings of ours, yea, afore
the foundation of the world was laid, GOD hath decreed
with himselfe to saue through Christ, all them that doe beléeue.
               
               
                  How Predestination was the first worke that God made.
                  God before the be
                        •
                     inning of the worlde, did worke but
onelye the worke of Predestination, of the which Saint
Paule sayth Ephesians. 1. GOD hath predestinate and

chosen vs to him through Christ our Lord before the foundation
of the world was laide. So that the work of Predestination
was the first worke of GodPredestinatiō the first work that God made. that we doe reade of in the
scripture, which was perfectly finished before the world began.
The second worke of God, was the worke of creation,Crea
                           •
                        ion the secōd. that is,
of making all things of nothing. Of this worke it is written:
Qui viuit in eternum creauit omnia semel. He that liueth
euerlastingly, without beginning and without ending made
all things at once. By all thinges is vnderstoode the matter
and substaunce, whereof all thinges was afterwarde made,
which is called of Moses Coelum & terram. That vndigested
and vnshaped and vnfashioned lumpe, called of the Poettes
Chaos, whereof all the Firmament and the foure Elementes
were afterwarde made, that was made by the woorke of
creation, Idque semel, and that all at once. The worke of creation
béeing ended, God procéeded to the diuiding and setting of
things in order, which is called Opus distinctionis.
                     Opus distinctionis. And in this
worke we reade that GOD was occupied sixe daies.
                  This worke béeing ended, almightie God ceased from making
of any mo new things, and yet he neuerthelesse worketh continually,
in the redressing, in the preseruing, and in the gouerning
of the things that he hath made. Indéede vpon the sixt day
he made man, and blessed him with the strength of generation
in his posteritie vnto the end of the worlde, by vertue of which
blessing all men doe increase, doe multiplye, doe flourish and
come into the world. And yet notwithstanding that work of the
sixt day, God stil a pace worketh by his diuine prouidence & gouerning
of man wonderfully, which is called Opus gubernationis.
                     Opus gubernationis.
for the which his worke we are bound euery man to praise
him and to magnifie him according as we be taught by the prophet
in the Psalme, saieng in the person of Christ: O Father:
Tues qui extraxisti me de ventre, &c. Thou art he y• tookest
me out of my Mothers wombe.
Ric. Turnar.
                  
               
               
                  No reason can be giuen, why God did predestinate
this man more then that, but onely that
it was his pleasure so to doe.
                  I aske, how came it to passe that the fall of Adam did wrap
vs in eternal death, so many nations with their children being
infants, without remedy, but because it so pleased God? Heare

their tongues which are otherwise so pratling, must of necessity
be dumb. It is a terrible decrée I graūt, yet no man shalbe able
to deny but y• God foreknew what end man shuld haue, ere hee

                        •
                     reated him, & therfore foreknew it, because he had so ordeined
by his decrée If any man héere inueigh against the foreknowledge
of God, he rashly & vnaduisedly stūbleth. For what matter
is there I beséech you why the heauenly Iudge should be accused,
for y• he was not ignorāt of y• which was to come? Therfore
if there be anie iust or coulourable complaint, it toucheth
Predestination. Neither ought it to serue an absurditie which
I say, that God foresawe not onley the fall of the first man, &
in him the ruine of his posteritie, but also disposed it after his
own wil. For as it belongeth to his wisdome to foreknow all
things that shall be. So it belongeth to his power to rule & gouerne
all things with his hand
                        •
                      And this question, Augustine
very well discusseth,

confesse, y• which we must rightly beleeue, that the God
and Lord of all things, which created all things very good, and
foreknew that euill things should spring out of good, and knew
that it more perteined to his almightie goodnesse euen of euill
things to doe well, then not to suffer them to be euill: That
he so ordered the lyfe of Angels & men, that in it hée might first
shew what frée will could, doe, & then y• the benefit of his grace
and iudgement could doe.

whom, no deseruing putteth any difference, God in his election
passeth ouer the one, and taketh the other. I 
                        •
                     on the other side do
aske them, whether they thinke that in him that is taken, there
is anie thing that may make the minde of God to encline toward
him. If they confesse (as they néedes must) that there is
nothing, it shall followe that God looketh not vppon man, but
from his owne goodnesse

                     heth a cause why to do good to him.
Whereas therefore God chooseth one man, refusing another,
this commeth not of respect of man, but of his mercie alone,
which ought to haue libertie to shew forth and vtter it selfe
where and when it pleaseth him. For wee haue in an other
place also shewed that there were not from the beginning
manye called noble or wise or honourable, that GOD
might humble the pride of the flesh: so farre is it off, that his

fauour was bound vnto persons.

                  The words of Fulgentius and Barnard.
                  God (sayth Fulgentius
                     Fulgentius.) did not promise all things which he
foretold, although he foretold al things which he promised. As he
did not predestinate all things which he foreknew, although he
foreknew al things which he did predestinate. He foreknew the
will of men good and bad, but he did not predestinate y• naughtie
wils, but the good.
Fulg. in his. 1. booke.
                  
                  The kingdome of God (sayth Barnard
                     Barnard.) is giuen, is promised,
is declared, is receiued: It is giuen in Predestination, it
is promised in calling, it is declared in iustification, it is receiued
in glorification. Thereof y• is sayd: Come ye blessed
of my Father, receiue the kingdome prepared for you.
                  So doth the Apostle saye: Those whome be predestinate hée
calleth: whome he calleth he iustifieth, and them he glorifieth.
In Predestination is grace, in calling is power, in iustification
is ioyfulnesse, in glorification is glorye and
praise.
Barnard vpon the worke of the booke of Wisedome.

Who be those? Euen them whome hée hath foreknowne
and predestinate to be fashioned lyke vnto the Image of his
sonne. A great and secrete Councell is made knowne. The
Lorde knoweth who be his: but that which was knowne vnto

                  Obiections against Predestination aunswered.
                  Because of Christ comming, we must denye both Predestination
or election and reprobation, for if Predestination saue
the one, and Reprobacion condemne the other, then is there nothing
left for Christ, and his comming is in vaine.
               
               
                  Aunswere.
                  But so many as are predestinate, are predestinate in Christ,
without whom there is no election: for those whom he predestinateth,
them also he calleth in Christ.
               
               
                  Obiection.

                  If rather confirmeth our hope: for if saluation were by vs
to be gotten, then we are so immutable that we should euery
minute of an houre, cast away our selues, but it is for our safetie,
that our saluation lyeth in the purpose of God.
               
               
                  Obiections in S. Augustines time.
                  That the true indeuour to rise againe, was taken from them
that were fallen, and occasion of carelesnesse ministred to them
which did stand: also that it taketh away the true vse of preaching
and rebuking, and maketh to none effect. Also that before
S. Augustines time, this doctrine was not preached, & yet notwithstanding
the doctrine of faith without it still defended.
               
               
                  Aunswere.
                  It ouerthroweth not the gift of preaching: for Paule the Apostle
of the Gentiles, and the preacher of the whole world, so
amply and so often vrgeth it in his Epistles to the Romanes, to
the Ephesians, and to Timothy. Also Luke in the Actes of the
Apostles. Math. 11. and. 22. Iohn. 10. 17. and. 25. For like as calling
is the meane to winne them that are predestinate, so consequently
by preaching is our calling fulfilled, and contrariwise
by preaching, are the wicked and reprobate made inexcusable.
                  They that are predestinate, are called by preaching.
                  They that are reprobate, are condemned by preaching.
               
            
            
               PRESCIENE.
               
                  Of the prescience of God, what it is.
                  
                     WHen we attribute prescience to God, we vnderstande that
all things haue euer bene, and perpetually abide present before
his eyes, so that to his eternall knowledge, nothing is by
past, nothing is to come, but all things are present, and so are
they present, that they are not as conceiued imaginations, or
formes and figures, whereof other innumerable things procéede
(as Plato testifieth, that of the forme and example of one
man, many thousands of men are fashioned) but we saye that
all things be so present before God, that he doth contemplate &
behold them in their veritie and perfection. And therefore it is,
that the Prophets oftentimes speake of things, béeing yet after
to come, with such certaintie, as that they were alreadye done.
And this prescience of God do we affirme to be extended to the
vniuersall compasse and circuite of the world, yea, and to euery
perticular creature of the same.

                  How the Priests office ought not to be despised
for the vice of the Priest.
                  When thou séest an vnworthye Priest, slaunder not the
Priesthood. For thou oughtest not to condemne the thing, but
him that euill vseth a good thing. Sith Iudas also was a
traytour, howbeit for this, the other Apostles is not accused,
but the minde of him: neither is it the fault of the
Priesthoode, but of the euill minde. And thou therefore
blame not the Priesthoode, but the Priest that vseth euill
a good thing. For if one dispute with thée and say: Séeest
thou yonder Christian, aunswere thou: But I speake
not to thée of the personnes, but of the things, or els
how many Phisitions haue bene made slaughter men, and
haue giuen poyson for remedies, and yet I despise not the Art,
but him that euill vseth the Arte.
                  
                     How many shipmen haue guided euill their ships, yet is not the
Arte of sailing euill, but the minde of them. If the Christen
man be wicked, accuse not thou the profession of the Priesthood,
but him that euill vseth a good thing.

                  How all men be Priests.
                  There is no man almost of the faithfull (saith Augustine)
that doubteth but that the Priesthood of the Iewes, was a figure
of the princely Priesthoode to come, which is now in the
Church, wherein all they be consecrated, which doe belong to
the body of Christ, the chiefe and true Prince of Priests.
                  For now all men be annoynted, whereas at that time, Kinges
and Priests were so onely. And whereas Peter writing to christen
people, called them a royall Priesthood, he declared y• both
the names of them did agrée vnto that people vnto whom y• same
annointing did belong.All Christen men be priests In another place he saith, From which
time (saith he) those which doe beleeue & be cleansed by ye sanctifieng
of that Baptime, they be annoynted, not some, as it was
before in the law, but all for Prophets, Priests and Kings. By
the example of the which annoynting, we be admonished what
manner of folkes we ought to be, that our conuersation be not
lesse holy then our annoynting is. For from the Sacrament of
this annoynting both the word of the name of Christ, and all
Christians, that is to say, such as beleeue in Christ, is descended
and deriued, which name is naughtely and vaine applied vnto
him, which doth not follow Christ. And Origen saith: As many
(saith he) as be annoynted with the holy Oyntments, bée
made Priests, like as Peter sayd to all, Churches: You bée a
chosen sort & a royall Priesthood, a holy people: you be therefore
a Priestly kinde, & therefore you repaire to the holy places. And
Beda vpon the first Epistle of Peter, Whereby (saith he) he doth
most manifestly admonish vs, that whereas we be of our selues
an holy Priesthood, we may be builded vpon the foundation of
Christ, therefore he calleth euery Church an holy Priesthoode,
which name of office the house of Aaron had euer in the lawe:
for surely we be all of vs members of the high Priest, and wée
be all marked with the Oyle of gladnesse. And Hierom vpon
the Prophet Malachy saith: We be all the priestly and royall
kinde, which being baptised in Christ, doe beare the name of
Christ. These be the saiengs of those Doctors, by whose testimonies

it is approued, that the same which is mentioned of the
Priesthood of the new Testament in the places before rehearsed,
doth pertaine vnto all Christen persons, & that therfore we
be all Priests.
Muscu. fol. 251.
                  
                  In the new Testament, Priests be called by this word Sacerdotes, y• is to say (I thinke) Sacrificers. And thus as Christ
was called Rex & Sacerdos, King & Priest, so be all true Christen
men in the new Testament, as is testified. Apoc. 1. 5. &. 6.
by Christ made Kings and Priests. The words of the Apoc.
be thus: To Iesus Christ which hath loued vs, and washed vs
from our sinnes, through his bloud, & made vs Kings & Priests
vnto God, euen his Father, vnto him be glory and rule for euer
and euer, Amen. Thus saith Iohn. speaking of all Christen people.
In like manner it is said. 1. Pet. 2. where he writeth to the
Christen men: You (quod he) be a chosen generation, a Regall
Priesthood, an holy people. S. Bede expounding the same, shall
testifie plainly with me. And S. Austen I wote wel in diuers
places, that all Christen men be so called Regale Sacerdotium.
And likewise doth Faber in his Commentaries vppon the same
place. Whosoeuer looketh vpon the treatise called Vnio dissidentium, shall finde a multitude of auncient Fathers saiengs,
declaring the same.

                  How to know a true Priest.
                  To take a Priest for a Sacrificer for sinne, is iniurious to
Christ, and we know none such in the new Testament, for that
Priesthood must néedes ende, with the law of Sacrifice. But to
take a Priest as Malachy doth:How a true Priest is knovvn The lippes of the Priest shall
kéepe knowledge, and they require the lawe at his mouth, for
he is the Angell and the Minister of the Lord of Hostes. Héere
finde we a better mark then ye beasts marke or the flesh marke
                        •
                     
that is to say knowledge, whereby onely he doth the message of
his Lord and master, and instructeth his Shéepe in the lawe of
God. By this marke are true Priests tried and knowen.

                  A Priest shall defile him at the death of none of his people.
¶The Priests be warned, that they shal not come at the common
wakings & lamentations of the dead, lest they should therby

be the more vnapt to doe sacrifices, wherevnto they wer properly
appointed, and least they should by their wéeping giue an
occasion to destroy the beleefe of the resurrection of ye dead.

                  How the Priesthood is translated.
                  S. Paule saith,Heb. 7. 12. that forasmuch as the Priesthoode is translated,
no remedy the lawe must also be translated. Paule indeuoureth
none other, but to declare, that lyke as the Priesthoode is
now translated from the Tribe of Leuy,
                     The priesthood trāslated. to Christ and his spiritual
generation
                        •
                      which are Priests after the order of Melchisedech,
so must the lawe also be translated, that is to say, the
Ceremoniall law, which prescribeth vnto the Leuites, the kinde
and order of their sacrifices, must now be translated & altered.
For Moses prescribeth nothing to this Priesthood, that is after
the order of Melchisedech. The Priests of this order, must follow
the example of their first and chiefe Priest Iesus Christ,
who offered vp his owne body, and none other sacrifice, so must
we, if we be Priests of that order, offer vp our bodies a lyuely
and acceptable sacrifice vnto God, alwaies singing vnto him in
our hearts, and so shall we be true honourers of God the Father,
and shall honour him in spirite and trueth.

                  Who began first to make the statute
of Priests chastitie.
                  Some saith that Calixtus primus did first make the statute
that Priests should vow chastitie, but that is not so. For all
Chronicles beareth witnesse that Priestes hadde wiues in the
Councell of Nicene, the which was almost an hundred yeares
after Calixtos daies. But auncient histories doth make mention,
y• 
                     Nicholas the first, which was bishop of Rome, the yere of
our Lord. 860. did goe about this thing, but he coulde not bring
it to passe,S. Huldrik by the reason of an holy man. S. Hulderich Bishop
of Auguensais, which wrote sharpe Epistles against him, reprouing
him sore, y• because he would compell Priests to vow chastitie,
his words be these: Thou hast not swarued a little from

discretion, y• whereas thou oughtest to haue counselled Priests
to chastitie, thou hast with a Lordly violence compelled them
to it. Is not this after the iudgement of all wise men a great
violence, when that thou, against the institution of the Gospel,
and against the decrée of the Holy ghost, wilt compell men to
serue thy priuate decrée, &c. ¶Note that this holy man saith,
that Priests ought to be admonished and counsailed to chastitie,
but not compelled. For that (saith he) is a great violence, and
against Christs holy Gospell, and the blessed spirit of God.
                  This holy man procéedeth further with the Bishop of Rome,
and telleth a fact of S. Gregory,
                     S. Gregor. the which went about to compell
Priests to vow chastitie. Upon a daye S. Gregory sent vnto
his Pondes for fish, and in the nets that they fished withall,
were brought about 6000.6000. heads. young childrens heades, the which
thing when S. Gregory saw, strake him sore to the heart, and
was very heauie of that sight, and perceiued anone, that his decrée that he made for Priests chastitie, was the occasion of this
great murther, in that that Priests could not liue sole, nor yet
they durst not auow their children for feare of the decree. And
so for sauegard of their honestie, they fell into a fearefull and
abhominable sinne, to kill their owne children. And for this
cause S. Gregory (saith this holy Bishop) did reuoke his decrée
againe, and did greatly allow the saieng of the Apostle: It is
better to marry then to burne. Adding to it of his owne: It
is better to marry, then to giue occasion of murder.

                     A Man ought to obey his Prince, but in the Lord, and neuer
against the Lord. For he that knowingly obeyeth his Prince
against God, doth not a dutie to the Prince, but is a deceiuer of
his Prince, and an helper vnto him to worke his owne destruction.
He is also vniust which giueth not the Prince, that is the
Princes, and to God that is Gods. A noble saieng of Valentinianus the Emperour for choosing the Bishop of Millayne,

there is about the exposition of this verse. Some delyght in the
applieng of it to the building of ye Temple at Ierusalem. Other
in a spirituall Allegorie apply it to the mēbers of Christ, which
vndoubtedly agréeth very handsomely with the processe of the
Prophet, as thus. O ye Princes open your gates. By y• Princes
which haue giuen their names and their faith, to Christ the
holy Lord, may well be vnderstood all such men which doe earnestly
studie to liue a godly lyfe. All they whether they be men
or women, poore or rich, high or low, in the sight of the world,
they are neuertheles spiritually Princes, lyke as they be called
spirituall Priests: Priests as S. Peter doth call them, because
they sacrifice daily vnto god, their bodely members, their whole
heart & minde to the true seruing of God. And lyke as they bée
called in respect of such spirituall sacrifice, Priests: so may all
true Christians be called princes, because they haue conquered
(as I might say) and crucified as S. Peter tearmeth it, their
flesh against all vice and concupisence. To these Princes the
Prophet now speaketh, saieng: O ye Princes, O ye liuing
Saints, O ye dearely beloued members of Iesus Christ, open
your gates, not your gates made of timber and boords, but your
spirituall gates, ye gates and dores of your soules, which be spirituall
and eternal, open them resist not the Holy ghost, quench
not the spirit, that Christ the king of eternall glory, may come
and dwell in your hearts. Loue him, and labour continually to
kéepe his Commaundements, and then surely both he and his
Father with the holy Ghost, will come and dwell with you.

folly Arnobius writeth thus: Nudi cruda, &c. They go about
naked in the raw Winter, other haue their cappes on: they
carry about with them olde targets, beate their skinnes, they
lead their Gods a begging round about the stréetes, they suffer

                  WHen the Scripture saith thus: God is a spirite, it is a proper

then it is an improper speach.

it is a proper speach, because he is so of his owne
nature: But when it maketh shewe that he is chaungeable,
as when it saith, he repented that he had made man. And in another
place, he repented that he had made Saule king, then it
is an improper speach.

                      I am the light of the world, it is a proper
speach, for it is true indéede, that Iesus Christ is the onely
sonne of righteousnesse, which doth lighten the world with
true lyght. And afterwarde when he saith to his Disciples:
Ye are the lyght of the worlde, that is an improper speach,
because they are not the lyght in themselues, but in the
Lord.
                  ¶When he saith to his Apostles, Preach repentaunce and
remission of sinnes in my name, he speaketh most properly, because
it is hée of whome the Prophets doe beare witnesse, that
whosoeuer beléeueth in him, shall receiue remission of sinnes
through his name. But when he saith afterward: To whomsoeuer
you shall remit sinnes, they shall be remitted, he speaketh
improperly: because he giueth that vnto the Apostles,
which properlye belongeth vnto himselfe. For the Apostles
are but his ministers and messengers to pronounce remission
of sinnes, which commeth properly from Iesus Christ, to
those that beléeue, in him.

               PROVIDENCE.
               
                  Of the prouidence of God, what it is.
                  PRouidence is not onely that vnspeakable power whereby it
commeth to passe, that God hath foreséene all things from

euerlasting, and most wisely prouided for al things before hand:
But also that eternall decree or ordinaunce of the most wise &
righteous God, whereby that euery thing that hath bene, hath
bene: and euery thing that is, is: and euery thing that shall
be, shall be: according as it liked him to appoint from euerlasting.
Beza.
                  
                  We meane by the prouidence of God, that euen as he is
creator of all things, he is also the conseruer, which doth by his
eternall power and wisedome, guide and gouerne them, and by
his souereigne goodnesse in such sort, that nothing commeth by
aduenture, neither in heauen nor in earth, without his counsell
and ordinaunce, and his most iust will, be it in generall, or in
perticular.
Peter. Viret.
                  
                  No good or euill doth happen without a cause, or by fortune
without Gods prouidence, but all things doth happen after his
iudgement.
Hierom. vpon Eze.
                  
                  Prouidence is Gods appointed, vnmoueable and perpetuall
administration of all things.
Pet. Mar.
                  
                  Prouidence is sometime as much to say as knowledge, and
foreknowledge of things to come. Sometime it signifieth an
ablenesse to foresee for others of things necessary, so it is sayde
that God in heauen doth foresee and care for all. Againe, some
doe define the prouidence of God after this wise: Prouidence
is the euerlasting and vnchaungeable kingdome and administration
of all things. They doe meane (saith Musculus) by the
word of kingdome, dominion and power, and by the word of administration,
the temperature of ye dominion which they added,
because of the finding and giuing of all things vnto vs, which
séemeth in shewe, to be a condition of ministery, as well as of
dominion.
Musc. fol. 425. and. 426.
                  
                  Gods prouidence we call that souereigne Empire and supreme
dominion, which God alwaies kéepeth in the gouernement
of all things in heauen and earth contained. And these
two (that is, prescience & prouidence) we so attribute vnto God,
that with the Apostle we feare not to affirme, that in him wée
haue our beeing, mouing and life. We feare not to affirme, that
the way of man is not in his own power, but that his foot-steps
are directed by the eternall God That the sorts & lots which appeare
most subiect to fortune) goe so soorth by his prouidence,

that a Sparrow falleth not on the ground, without our heauenly
Father. And thus we giue not to God any prescience, by
an idle sight, and a prouidence by a generall mouing of his creatures
(as not onely some Philosophers, but also moe then is
to be wished in our dayes doe) but we attribute vnto him such
a knowledge & prouidence, as is extended to euerye one of his
creatures. In which he so worketh, that willingly they tende &
incline to the ende, to the which they are appointed by him, &c.
Knox. fol. 21.
                  
                  Because we knowe not all things (saith S. Austen) which
God doth concerning vs in most good order, that therefore in only
good will we do according to the law, because his prouidence
is an vnchaungeable law. Therefore sith God doe claime vnto
himselfe the poore to rule the world, which is to vs vnknown.
Let this be a lawe to vs of sobernesse and modestie, quietly to
obay his souereigne authoritie, that his wil may be vnto vs the
onely rule of Iustice, as the most iust cause of all things. I
meane not that absolute will, of which the Sophisters doe babble,
seperating by wicked & prophane disagreement, his Iustice
from his power, but I meane that prouidence, which is the gouernesse
of all things, from which proceedeth nothing but right,
although the causes be hidden from vs.

                  THis proouing and examining of a mans selfe, is first to think
with him, with what lust & desire he commeth to the Maundie,
and will eate that bread. Whether he be sure that he is the
childe of God, and in the faith of Christ: and whether his conscience
doe beare him witnesse that Christs body was broken for
him. And whether the lust that he hath to prayse God, and
thanke him with a faithfull heart in the middes of the bretheren
doe driue him thetherward, or els whether he doe it for
the meates sake, or to kéepe the custome: for then were it better
he were away. For he that eateth and drinketh vnworthely
eateth and drinketh his owne damnation, because he maketh
no difference of the Lordes bodye, that as it is sayde

before, he that regardeth not the purpose, for which it was instituted,
and putteth no difference betwéene his eating and other
eating (for other eating doe onely serue the belly) but this eating
was instituted and ordeined, to serue the soule and inward
man. And therefore he that abuseth it to the flesh, eateth & drinketh
his owne damnation, &c.

it is said, & the man that commiteth adulterie with another
mans wife, because he hath committed adultery with his neighbors
wife, the adulterer & the adultresse, shal both dye ye death.
But ye law doth not therefore punish the sinnes and offences of
men, as though the punishment of the sword were a satisfaction
for sinne (for the death of Christ onely hath made satisfaction
for sinne). But offenders are punished by the sworde

for examples sake, that the people might feare to offend. And
least in time, sinne and wickednesse might be counted for vertue
and righteousnesse. For the sinne that is left vnpunished,
is not knowne to be sinne.

other Purgatorie for them: As indéede there is none other to

For so long as ther was no care for purgatory, no man sought
after pardons.

yeares after Christ
                  S. Austen was. 400. years after Christ. And yet in his time
was it not fully & fastly beléeued to be an Article of our faith:
no, nor yet fully and fastly beléeued to be true: for he himselfe
writeth in his Enchiridion on this manner, speaking of Purgatory,
after that he expounded the place of Paule. 1. Cor. 3. and
had taken this word fire, not for Purgatory, but for temptation
and tribulation, he added these words in the. 69. chapter: It
is not incredible that such a thing should also chaunce after
this life, and whether it be so or no, it may be questioned, &c.
I. Frith.
                  
                  S. Austen ouerthroweth al praiers for the dead with this, whē he
teacheth that all men looketh for ye resurrection of the flesh, &
the eternall glory, & that euery man then receiueth the rest y•
followeth after death, if he be worthy when he dieth. And therfore
he testifieth y• al the godly do immediatly after death enioy
y• blessed rest as well as y• Prophets, the Apostles & Martirs. If
their estate be such, what I beseech you (saith Caluine) shal our
praiers auaile them.

                  When (say they) the Lord affirmeth that the sinne against the
holy Ghost shuld not be forgiuen in this world, nor in ye world
to come, ther he sheweth y• ther is a forgiuenesse of some sins
in the world to come. But who séeth not that the Lord there,

speaketh of the fault of sinne? Now if it be so, what is that to
their Purgatory, forasmuch as by their opinion, y• paine is ther
suffered of those sins, whereof they deny not the fault to be forgiuen
in this present lyfe? But that they may no more carpe
against vs, they shall haue yet a plainer solution. When the
Lord meant to cut off all hope of pardon from so hainous wickednesse,
he thought it not inough to say that it should neuer
be forgiuen: but the more to amplifie it, he vsed a diuision,
wherin he comprehended both the iudgement that euery mans
conscience féeleth in this life, and the last iudgement that shall
be pronounced at the resurrection: As though he shoulde haue
sayde: Beware ye of malitious rebellion, as of most present
damnation: for he that of set purpose, shall endeuour to quench
the light of the holy Ghost, shall not obeteine pardon, neither in
this lyfe which is giuen to sinners for their conuersion, nor in
the last day, when the lambes shall be seuered by the Angels of
God from the Goates, and the kingdome of heauen shall bée
cleansed from al offences. Then they bring forth also that parable of Mathew. Agrée with thine aduersarie, least he delyuer
thée to the Iudge, and the Iudge to the Sergeant, and the
Sergeant to the prison,Agree with thine aduersary. from whence thou shalt not gette forth
vntill thou haue paide the vttermost farthing. If in this place
the Iudge doe signifie God, and the aduersarie plaintiue the
Diuell, the Sergeant the Angell, and the prison Purgatory, I
will gladly yéeld vnto them: But if it bée euident to all men
that Christ meant there to shew into how many daungers &
mischifes they cast themselues, y• had rather obstinatly pursue
the extremitie of the lawe, then deale according to equitie and
good right, to the end to exhort his Disciples, the more earnestly
to agrée with equitie: where then I pray you shall Purgatory
be found.

                  How Purgatorie came from the Heathen.
                  As for the fansie of Purgatory, it sprang first from the heathen,
and was receiued among them in that time of darknesse,
long before the comming of CHRIST, as it maye
plainely appeare by Plato and Virgil, in whome ye shall finde
described at large, the whole common weale, and all the orders
and degrées of Purgatory. Saint Austen sayth, the olde Heathen
Romanes had a sacrifice which they called, Sacrum Purgatorium,
                     
a Purgatory sacrifice.

                  An Argument of Purgatory.
                  It is impossible that remission or purging from sins shuld be
made without bloud,Argument. 
                     Paule to ye Hebrues. But in Purgatory
ther is no bloud but fire, Ergo in purgatory it is impossible that
remission or purging from sinnes should be made.
               
               
                  Obiection.
                  Purgatory is good to feare men from sinne.
               
               
                  Aunswere.
                  Christ and his Apostles thought hell fire inough, & yet (besides
the fleshly imagination cannot stande with Gods word)
what great feare can there be of that terrible fire, which thou
maist quench almost for thrée halfe pence.
               
               
                  How our sinnes are onely purged by Christ.
                  By his owne person he hath purged our sinnes.Heb. 1. 3. ¶These
words (by his owne person) haue an Emphasis or vehemencie,
which driueth away all sacrificing Priests from such office of
sacrificing: séeing that which he hath done by himselfe, he hath
not left to be perfected by other, so that the purging of our sins
may more truely be thought done & past, then a thing to come
and to be done.

shall goe before him, and shall flame round about his enimies,
and the fire shall burne in sight, and round about him shall
be a greate tempest: saieng that diuerse of the olde writers approued

euill to his neighbour, as those doe that bid the Pestilence, the
Feuer quartaine, Saint Antonies euill, or such other execrations,
and should be punished as heretikes and blasphemers of
God, as ye may read Leuit. 20. 9. Gen. 27. 29. 1. Cor. 5. 5. Such
euill sayers hath no part in the kingdome of God. He that calleth
his brother foole, that is to say, contemne him, mocking, or
as men call it now a daies, flowting, or lowting, committeth
such murther, as is worthy hell fire, and eternall dampnation,
the which vice is reprehended, Psal. 56. And was so abhorred of
the Gentiles, that manye would rather suffer death then susteine
the slaunder of a pestilent tongue. Cham that cursed his
Father. Gen. 9. The Philistines that counted Sampson for a
foole. Iudic. 16. Michol that lowted Dauid her husband, 2. Reg. 6.

the same with death, more cruell then the magistrates doe
punish murtherers.

no harlot.
                  OF Rahab,
                     Iosu. 2. 1. some doe saye, that when the men which Iosua
had sent to spie out Iericho came into her house, they
came not to commit fornication with her (for she was no harlot)
but there to hide themselues. Other saye, that in times past
she had bene an harlot, but now shée was none, although that
name remained with her still,Lyra. as in Math. 4. it is sayd, that Iesus
came into the house of Symon the leper, not that he was
then a leper, but before that time he had béene a leper, of the
which Christ had healed him, and yet the name remained still
with him, so that hee was called still by that name, Symon the
leper. Other be against these and say, that this Rachab was
afterward ioyned in marriage to Salmon, which was one of
the principall men in the Tribe of Iuda, and therefore doe
thinke it vnlikely that hée would haue taken such a woman to
his wife, whcih had bene then named to be an harlot, or euer
had bene any before: But she was a woman that kept an honest

                      both for straungers & other, & no harlot. For
where as we haue in our speach, a woman harlot, they haue in

the Chaldish tongue,Iosu. 2. 4. a woman that selleth victualls.

                  Of Rahabs lye she made.
                  But I wist not what they were. ¶Albeit Rahab lyed of a
good intent, yet in that she lyed she did amisse, for as Saint
Paule sayth, We must not doe euill that good maye come of
it. For as her act in hiding Gds people, came of faith and is
praised. Heb. 11. 31. and Iames. 2. 2. So her lye came of the feare
and weaknesse of the flesh,Iosu. 2. 11. and therefore not to be followed.

                  The Rauen that Noe sent out of the Arke,Gen. 8. 9 went
going and returning vntill the waters were dried vp vpon
the earth. But the Doue which he sent out, finding no resting
place for her foote, retourned vnto him into the Arke, suffering
Noe to pull her in vnto him with his hande.
                  Uppon this place the Bible note sayth thus: It séemeth the
Rauen béeing a wilde and vncleane foule, fed of the dead carcases,
and therefore refused to tourne againe into the Arke. But
the Doue being of nature a tame foule, and vsed to cleane
foode, and finding no place to rest on, suffered her selfe to be receiued
in againe.

               REGENERATION.
               
                  What this word (Regeneration) importeth.
                  THis worde Regeneration importeth as much as a man
might say, new birth. As if after that wée were once borne,
we are borne yet againe. And therefore it importeth forthwith
a reformation fo the man, which is a rising againe from the
dead, which is wrought in the spirit, as the last resurrection
shall be wrought in the flesh.
Pet. Viret.
                  
                  Regeneration standeth chiefly in these two points: In mortification,
that is to say, a resisting of the rebellious lusts of the
flesh, and in newnesse of life, whereby we continually striue to
walke in that purenesse and perfection, wherewith we are clad
in Baptime.

is the true manner of regeneration. But all men for the most
part by this sentence of our Sauiour Christ vnderstand Baptime,
and many of them doe héereby make Baptime so necessary,
that they affirme it impossible for a man to attaine to saluation,
except he be washed with the water of Baptime: & so disorderly
they include the assuraunce of our saluation vnder the
signe, when as the whole Scripture attributeth the grace and
power of regeneration to the Holye ghost: as maye appeare
in diuers places of Scripture, but specially by these places
noted in the margent.Mat. 16. 16 And as touching this place we ought
to vnderstand the same simply of mans regeneration and not of
Baptime.Tit. 3. 5. For the purpose of Christ was to exhort Nichodemus
to newnesse of life, because he was not capable of the Gospell,
vntill he was a newe man. Therefore this is the simple
meaning of this place. That it behooueth vs to be born againe,
that we may be the sonnes of God, and also that the Holy ghost
is the Author of the second birth.

that intire part, from which springeth chiefely the strength &
the desire of naturall generation, which effect or desire in man,
because of all other effects it is the most mightiest, therfore the
Scripture, vseth to call the secrets or the priuie thought or effects
of a man, by the name of the reynes or the kidneyes. Insomuch
as when the Scripture saith that God knoweth all our
harts & our thoughts, then the Scripture saith: Scrutans corda

                  What is ment by renting of our hearts.
                  Rent your hearts and not your garments. Ioel
                     Ioel. 2. 13 meaneth
that it is to no purpose for men to haue great store of ceremonies,
and to martir themselues much in outward sight of
the world, except their hearts be broken before. And what manner
of renting or breaking is it that God requireth in our
hearts, it is, that we should be cast downe and humbled before
him: that when we perceiue any signes of his wrath (specially
when we feele the blowe of his hand already) we should be patient,
assuring our selues that all commeth for our sinnes: and
that we doe not as many doe, who when they be beaten with
Gods rod, chawe their bridles lyke mules, and conceiue I wot
not what a fiercenesse & bitternesse, which serue to set them in
a rage against God, notwithstanding that, they make countenaunce
as though they were well tamed. But contrariwise
(as I haue said) it behooueth our hearts to be rent, according to
the exhortation that is made vnto vs in the Psalme, by laieng
our hearts open before God, to the ende that he should knowe
all that is within it. Then let vs follow the said saieng of the
Prophet Ioel, that we should not rent our garments, but our
hearts rather, for therein will the true repentaunce shewe it
selfe.

                  REpentaunce is an vnfained tourning to God, whereby wée
being of a sincere feare of God once humbled, doe acknowledge
our sinnes, and so by mortifieng our olde man, are afresh
renued by the spirit of God.
Bulling. fol. 562.
                  
                  Repentaunce is a very displeasure which man hath in his
heart of his sinne, the which ingenderesh in him an hatred against
sinne, & a desire to liue better in time to come, reseruing
his life to the will of God.

                  Repentaunce is nothing but a conuersion of the minde, and

of the Prophet: Turne vnto me,Esa. 45. 22 and ye shall be safe.Eze 18. 31 Againe,Act. 3. 19

                  Repentaunce is an inward thing, which hath his seate in

                  Concerning this word Repentaunce (as they vsed) Penaunce,
the Hebrue hath in the olde Testament generally (Sob)
Turne or be conuerted, for which the Translation that we take
for S. Hieromes, hath most part (Conuert
                           •
                        ) to turne, or to bee
conuerted. And sometime (Agite poenitentiam). And y• Gréeke
in the new Testament, hath perpetually (Metanoeo) to tourne
in the heart and minde, and to come into the right knowledge, &
to a mans right wit againe, for which (Metanoeo) S Hieroms
translation hath sometime (Ago poenitentiam) I doe repent.
Sometime (Poeniteor) I am repentaunt. Sometime (Habeo
poenitentiam) I haue repentaunce. Sometime (Poenitet me) it
repenteth me. And Erasmus vseth much this word (Recipisco)
I come to my selfe, or to my right minde againe. And the very
sense and signification both of the Hebrue & also of the Gréeke
word is: to be conuerted, and to turne to God with all ye heart
to know his will, and to liue according to his lawes, and to be
cured of our corrupt nature with the Oyle of his spirit & wine
of obedience of his doctrine, which conuersion or turning, if it be
vnfained, these foure doe accompanie it, and are included therein:
Confession, not in the Priests eare, for that is but mans inuention,
but to God in the heart, and before all the Congregation
of God, how that we be sinners and sinfull, and that our
whole nature is corrupt and inclined to sinne and all vnrighteousnesse,
and therefore, euill, wicked and damnable, & his lawes
holy and iust, by which our sinfull nature is rebuked. And also
to our neighbour, if we haue offended any man perticularly.
Then Contrition, sorrowfulnesse that we be such damnable sinners,
and not onely haue sinned, but are wholly inclined to sin
still. Thirdly, Faith, of which our olde Doctors haue made no
mention at all, in the description of their Penaunce, that God
for Christs sake doth forgiue vs, and receiue vs to mercie, and

is at one with vs, & will heale our corrupt nature. And fourthly
satisfaction or amends making, not to God with holy works,
but to mine neighbour whome I haue offended (if anye open
crime be found in me) and submitting of a mans selfe vnto the
Congregation of the Church of Christ. And note this, as satisfaction
and amends making is counted righteous before the
world, and a purging of sinne, so that: the world, to whome I
haue made a full amends, hath no farther to complaine: euen
so faith in Christs bloud is counted righteousnesse, and a purging
of all sinne before God. Moreouer he that sinneth against
his brother, sinneth also against his Father almightie God, & as
the sinne committed against his brother, is purged before the
world with making amendes or asking forgiuenesse. Euen so
is the sinne committed against God, purged through faith in
Christs bloud, onely for Christs

                  Of two manner of repentaunce.
                  I finde (saith Frith, to Rastall) two manner of repentaunce,
one is without faith, & is such a repentaunce as Iudas & Rastals
Christen men which continue still in sinne, haue at latter end,
which doth rather purchase them an halter, then the remission
of sinnes. Another repentance followeth instification & remission
of sins, & is a florishing fruit of faith, for when by faith wee
do perceiue ye fauour & kindnesse y• our louing father hath shewed
vs in his sonne Iesus Christ, and that he hath reconciled vs

vnto himselfe, by the bloud of his sonne, then begin we to loue
him, the more we hate the body of sinne, and lament and be sory
that our members are so fraile, that they cannot fulfill ye lawe
of God, and so in mourning and bewailing our infirmitie, it
causeth vs to abstaine both from meate and drinke and worldly
pleasures, which is the pure fasting, that we talke off: but
you vnderstand it not. And this repentaunce commeth not to
purge the sinnes which is committed before, but onely
                        •
                     
taketh an occasion by the sinnes before committed, to know
what poyson there remaineth in our flesh, and seeketh by all
meanes to make vs hate this body of sinne, and to subdue it
with all manner of workes, that God hath appointed, to the
intent that it should in time to come, no more displease God
our most mercifull Father, which of gentlenesse so often pardoneth
and forgiueth vs, as I touched before. This is the manner
of repentaunce which I finde in scripture, but this helpeth that
we should sinne no more: but what Rastall dreameth I wote
not. But to expresse the vttermost what I meane by repentaunce,
marke this example.Example of an house. If a man builde an house, which
doth cost him much labour and money, and haue layed no sure
foundation, but that when a tempest commeth his house doeth
fall, then will he be very sorie, and repent that he hath so foolishly
bestowed his money and labour. Notwithstanding all this
great sorrow and repentaunce cannot set vp his house againe
which is fallen, but onely it taketh an occasion by the ruine of
the house, to teach the owner wit against another time, y• when
he buildeth againe, he may make a sure foundation. Euen so,
though thou repent neuer so much, that cannot get remission of
thy sinnes: that is, but that must be pardoned onely by ye faith
in Christs bloud. Neuerthelesse it doth teach thée wit, & learne
thée to tame thy body, & subdue it, & cast a low foundation, that
in time thou maist the better resist the assaults of the Diuell,
the world and the flesh. This doth Frith teach of Repentance,
let the world take it as they will, but Christs Shéepe doe heare
his voice.

                     REprobation is the most wise purpose of God, whereby hée
hath before all eternitie constantly decréed without any iniustice,
not to haue mercie of those whom he hath not loued, but
hath ouerhipped that by their iust condemnation, he might declare
his wrath towards sinners and also his glory.

                  How the iust cause of reprobation is hid vnto vs.
                  We say not that Gods ordinaunce is the cause of reprobation,
but we affirme that the iust causes of reprobation are hid
in ye eternall counsell of God, & known to his godly wisdome
alone, but the causes of sin of death & damnation are euident &
manifestly declared to vs in ye scriptures, to wit, mans fr

world, the contempt of graces and Gods mercies offered, with
the heaping vp of sinne vpon sinne, till damnation iustly came.
The causes I say of sinne, death and damnation, are plainly noted
vnto vs in Gods holy Scriptures. But why it pleased
God to shewe mercie to some, and denie the same to others, because
ye iudgments of God, are a deuouring depth, we enter not
in reasoning with him, but with all humilitie render thanks to
his Maiestie, for the grace and mercie, which we doubt not but
of his frée grace, we haue receiued in Christ Iesu our onely
head.

of which it is written: Likewise as Christ was raised vp from

raising is the other resurrection, that is of the bodye, which began
in Christ,Rom. 3. 11 the first fruits of the dead, for Paule saith, He that

raised vp Christ from death, shall quicken our mortall bodyes,

that God of his méere mercie rewardeth in vs his owne giftes,

He then that giueth any manner thing to a poore man, giueth
not of his owne, but of those goods that he hath receiued of
God.
Sir. I. Cheek.
                  
                  Or els ye shall haue no reward of your father which is in
Heauen.Mat. 6. 1. ¶This word Reward is alwaies taken in the
Scriptures for a frée recompence, and therefore the schoolemen,
doe fondly set it to be aunswerable to a deseruing, which they
call merite.
                  Concerning this word (Merces) Reward, there hath bene
much strife. The occasion of the Contention hath bene this:
Forasmuch as that thing which euery man shal receiue of God,
according to the measure of his good workes and godlinesse of
this lyfe, Christ doth call it Merces multa & copiosa: Therefore
some haue gone about to proue, that we by our good works,
otherwise called merites, doe deserue Heauen, and then (if that
be true) as Saint Paule saith, Christ died but in vaine. For
and if the benefite of iustification come by workes, then
no gramercie for the grace of God, for the merites of
Christ. To solute therefore this cauillation, learned men
doe gr
                        •
                     unt, that the quyethesse of conscience, good name and
good fame in this lyfe, and lyfe euerlasting after this
lyfe, is called (Merces) not for because that our merites

or good déeds in this life, be able to deserue the ioyes of heauen.
For as Paule saith, Non sunt condigne passionis, &c. Nor againe
it is not called (Merces) because that the merits and good
workes that we doe, are but Gods giftes, Qui operatur in nobis
& velle & perficere, but our receipt is called (Merces) reward,
albeit most meruailously surmoūteth all our deseruings,
be they neuer so great.Properly a reward is that vvhich a man deserueth through his labour & paines taken in bringing any thing to passe. To this ende and purpose, to prouoke
vs to labour most lustely in the Uineyard of the Lord. After
the same manner of speach: a naturall father for the tender
loue that he beareth toward his childe doing but meanly in vertue
and comming forward in learning, yet he will saye to the
encouraging of his childe: Sonne, goe too, and continue as thou
hast begun, and thy reward or thy part shall not be the least of
all thy bretheren. And according to this his promise, he endueth
him liberally, when hée maketh his Testament, not
for that the childe had deserued the one halfe of that he had
done for him before, but because he loued him.

And what saith it of Lazarus? There is no mention made of
his buriall: insomuch that it is not knowen whether he were
eaten with dogs, or whether he were cast abroad in the fields:
the Scripture speaketh not of it. It speaketh of the buriall of
the rich man. Contrariwise if Gods children happen sometimes
to lye vnburied: is it to be concluded therfore, y• they are accursed?
No, lyke as when the wicked are buried, it is not to be said
that they are blessed in their death. But it is to shew vs, that
God executeth not his temporall punishments after one egall
rate in this world, but reserueth the chiefe to himselfe till the
latter day.

his Ridle, and he aunswereth,Iud. 14. 12. because in such seasts, men
are sometimes woont when they haue well dronke, to be somewhat
full of talke, and somewhat too intemperately to rebuke
others, which things turneth for the most part into brawling
and chiding, and to auoide that, graue men were wont to put
forth Ridles or Problemes, omitting daungerous talke, and
turning their minde to the exposition of the things put foorth.
Whose example Sampson followed, and set foorth a reward for
him that should expounde his question. As though the knowledge
and sharpenesse of the minde ought to be rewarded, and
contrary punishment is instituted for ignoraunce and sluggishnesse,

                     Exultate iusti in Domino, rectos decet collaudatio. ¶O
ye righteous reioyce ye in the Lord:Psa. 33. 1. for it becommeth the vpright
liuers to giue praise or to be thankfull. S. Austen vppon
this place deuideth all the people of this world into two sorts
of men, Iustos & iniustos, rectos & curuos, siue rectos & prauos,
into righteous or vnrighteous, vpright or crooked, or straight
or froward liuers. Ther are neither of these two sorts of men,
but they are contented to praise God, and to speake well of the
Lord: but yet (saith Saint Austen) marke: the Prophet desireth
not the vnrighteous wranglers, lyars, théeues and adulterers,
nor the crooked craftie hasters and deceitfull deceiuers to
praise the Lord, why so? For it is written: Non est speciosa
laus in ore peccatoris, quia non est a Domino missus. The
praise of God to come out of the mouth of the wicked man, it
is not comely nor acceptable in his sight, for he is not sent of
the Lord so to doe: and no meruaile, for this we knowe by experience,
that there is none of vs all, which being but a man,
wise and of good iudgement, but he had rather be dispraised then

praised of such whose lyfe is impure, filthie and vncleane, for
their praise commonly are not dealt, but vnto such whome they
fauour, because in their liuing they be like vnto themselues: so y•
their praise is a dispraise, or at the least a suspected praise, that
he whom they praise, is rather a naughtie man thē a good man.
If this be true in wise men, how much more then must it bee
true in God, the father & fountaine of all wisedome, to refuse &
set naught by the praise of the proud, the wicked & vngodly men.
In consideration whereof the Prophet now saith: Exultate
iusti in Domino, rectos decet collaudatio. O ye righteous reioice
ye in the Lord, I speake not to the wicked, nor to the crooked,
wayward nor froward people of this world, if I shuld, they wold
peraduenture not deny to giue praises vnto the Lord. Nam curuus
& prauus, quam diu sibi bene est, Deum laudat, & benedicit,
si autem male, blasphemat: rectus semper laudat sicut Iob.

hath all things after his owne will & pleasure, so long he 
                        •
                     audeth
and praiseth God. But if he be a little pinched with pouertie
& aduersitie, then he raileth & curseth, then he banneth and
blasphemeth God & his most righteous works: but the righteous
& vpright men, they euermore laud & praise God, as wel in
aduersitie as in prosperitie, euen as Iob did, therefore saith th
                        •
                     
Prophet, to you that be righteous, that is, men truly penitent, &
sorie for your offences, trusting through Gods mercie all your
sins to be couered, & not imputed, nor neuer to be layd to your
charge, to you I say: Exultate iusti in Domino: O ye righteous
reioyce ye in the Lord.

sayd:1. proofe. 
                     Tu es Christus filius Dei viui. Thou art Christ the sonne
of the liuing God. And dispraised the man possessed with the
Legion of Diuells, who confessed as much as Peter did, when
he ran to Iesus and fell downe vpon his knées and worshipped
saieng: Quid mihi & tibi, Iesu filij Dei altissimi, O Iesu the
sonne of God the most highest, what haue I to doe with thée.

of God, may be obtained with money. Thou hast neither parte

nor fellowship in his businesse, for thy heart is not right in the

but note what I set by their praise (saith Christ) I shall saye
vnto them, Ego non noui vos, I know you not, I allow you not,
nor it was no pleasure to me to heare you praye or preach: It
was but blasphemy, Non erat collaudatio, it was no true praise,
it was but such as Symon Magus did giue vnto God, or such
as Bariesu would fayne haue giuen vnto God, whom Saint

                  RIghteousnesse is the méere gifte of God, without the workes

the beleeuers as a grace.

man, but betokeneth all the worshipers of God without exception.
Howbeit the Scripture calleth those men righteous, not
which are accounted such for desert of their workes, but such as
doe long after righteousnesse, because that after the Lord hath
imbraced them with his fauour, in not

                  The Christian righteousnesse.
                  Although (saith the Christian) I am a sinner by the lawe, &
vnder the condition of the law, yet I dispaire not, yet I dye not,
because Christ lyueth which is both my righteousnesse and
euerlasting lyfe, in that righteousnesse and lyfe, I haue
no sinne, no feare, no stinge of conscience, no care of
death. I am in déede a sinner, as touching this present
lyfe, and the righteousnesse thereof, and the childe of Adam,
where the lawe accuseth me, death raigneth ouer me, and
at length will deuoure me. But I haue another righteousnesse
of lyfe, aboue this lyfe, which is, Christ the sonne
of GOD, who knoweth no Sinne, nor Death: but is

righteous and lyfe eternall: by whom this body being dead &
brought into dust, shall be raised again, & deliuered from ye bondage
of the law and sinne, and shall be sanctified together with
the spirit.

                  How by the righteousnesse of Christ we
obteine to be iustified.
                  By the onely meane of Christs righteousnesse we obteine

to be iustified before, &c. Saint Ambrose hath excellently well
shewed how there is an example of this righteousnesse in the
blessing of Iacob. For as Iacob hauing not deserued the preheminence
of the first begotten sonne, hidde himselfe in the apparell
of his brother, & beeing clothed with his brothers coate,
that fauoured of a swéete smell, hée crept into the fauour of his
father, and receiued the blessing to his own commoditie, vnder
the person of an other: So we doe lye hidden vnder the precious
purenesse of Christ our elder brother, that we may gette
a testimonie of righteousnesse in the sight of God. The words
of Ambrose be these: Whereas Isaac smelt the sauour of the
garmentes, peraduenture this is meant thereby: that we
are not iustified by works but by faith: because fleshly weaknesse
hindereth workes, but the brightnesse of faith, which meriteth
forgiuenesse of sinnes, ouershaddoweth the errour of
déedes. And truely so it is, that we maye appeare before the
faith of God vnto saluation, it is necessary for vs to smel swéetly
with his odour, and to haue our faultes couered and buryed
with his perfection.

                  How righteousnesse is to be vnderstood.
                  Righteousnesse is euen such fayth, as is called Gods righteousnesse,
or righteousnesse, that is of value before God. For
it is Gods gift: and it altereth a man and chaungeth him into
a new spirituall nature, and maketh him frée and liberal to pay
euery man his duetie: for through faith a man is purged of
his sinnes, and obteineth lust to the lawe of God, whereby hée
giueth God his honour, and paieth him that he oweth him, &
                        ••
                     
men he doth seruice willingly wherewith so euer he can, & paieth
euery man his duetie. Such righteousnesse can nature, fréewill,
& our owne strength neuer bring to passe. For as no man
can giue himselfe faith, so can he not take away vnbeliefe, how
then can he take away anie sinne at all. Wherefore all is false
hypocrisie and sinne, whatsoeuer is done without fayth or in
vnbeliefe, as it is euidēt in the. 14. chap. to the Romanes. ver. 23.
though it appeare neuer so glorious or beautifull outward.

déede is righteousnesse vnto the auoiding of punishment,
threatnings, & curssings, & to obtein temporal blessings: but vnto
the life to come, thou must haue the righteousnesse of faith,

Looke then how much the earth of it self is able to do in
getting & procuring to it selfe seasonable showres of raine to

our owne strength & works, in winning this heuenly & eternal
righteousnes, & therefore shall neuer be able to atteine it, vnles

the Ephesians saith: He hath declared the power of God by the
similitude of a man, not because a seate is placed, and God the
Father sitteth theron, hauing his sonne sitting there with him:
But because we cannot otherwise conceiue how the sonne doth
iudge and reigne, but by such words to our capacitie. As therefore
to be next to God or to depart farre from him is not to bée
vnderstoode according to the distance of places, but after mens
merits, because the Saints are heard by him, but the sinners (of
whome the Prophet sayth, Beholde they that gette themselues
from thée shall perish) are remoued farre inough for comming
néere him at all. Euen so lyke wise to bée either at the right or

left hand of God, is to be taken so, that the Saintes are at his
right hand, and sinners at his left. As our Sauiour himselfe
also in the Gospell affirming the same doth say, that at ye right
hand are the sheepe, and the Goates at the left. Moreouer, this
very word (to Sit) doth argue the power of a Kingdome, by
which God is beneficiall to them on whom he doth vouchsafe
to sit, insomuch as verely he doth rule them, and hath them alwayes
in his guiding, and doth tourne to his owne becke or
gouernement, the neckes of them that before ranne out of the
way, at randon, and at libertie.

beléeue that he sitteth at the right hand of God the Father: yet
not so therefore as though we should thinke that God the Father
is comprehended within the limits of a mans body: so y•
they that thinke of him shuld imagine that he had both a right
and a left side: And wheras it is sayd that the father sitteth, we
must not suppose that he doth sit with bended hammes, least
peraduenture we fall into the same sacriledge for which the Apostle
accurseth them that haue chaunged the glorye of the incorruptible
God, into the similitude of a corruptible man. For
a detestable thing it is to place God in such a lykenesse in a
christian Church: and much more wicked it is to place it in the
heart, where the Temple of God is verely and indéede, if it be
cleansed from earthly desires and errours. We must therfore
vnderstande that at the right hande is as much to say, as with
greatest happinesse, where righteousnesse and peace and gladnesse
is: Euen as also the Goates are placed at the left hand,
that is, in miserie, for their iniquities to their paine & torment.
Whereas God therefore is said to sit, therby is not meant the
placing of his limites, but his iudiciall power, which his maiestie
neuer wanteth in bestowing worthy rewards, to those that
are worthy of them, &c.

¶signifieng Rome, for as much as the vices which were
in Babilon are found in Rome in greater abundance, as persecution
of the Church of God, oppression and slauerie, with destruction
of the people of God, confusion, superstition, Idolatry,
impietie, & as Babilon the first Monarch was destroid, so shal
this wicked kingdome of Antichrist haue a miserable ruine,
though it hée great, and séemeth to extend throughout all Europa.

                  And their corps shall lye in the stréets of the great citie,Apoc. 11. 8 which
spiritually is called Sodome and Aegypt, where our Lord was

crucified. ¶Meaning the whole iurisdiction of the Pope, which
is compared to Sodome and to Aegypt, because the true libertie
to serue God is taken away from the faithfull, and Christ
was condemned by Pilate, who represented the Romane power
which should be enimie to the godly.
               
               
                  Obiection.
                  What impudencie is it to affirme that Christ was crucified
at Rome, and all the worlde knoweth he suffered death at
Hierusalem.

                     Rome béeing vnderstood for the Regiment, &c. As is aforesaid,
the proofe is euidently made, that our Sauiour Christ suffered,
and was crucified at Rome.
                  
               
               
                  Reasons to proue that Christ suffered at Rome.
                  By whom was he condemned, was it not by Pilate the deputie
or lieuetenant of the Romane Empire, &c?
                  For what cause or crime was he iudged to dye? Was it not
for treason pretended to be committed against the Romane
Empire?
                  With what kinds of execution was he put to death? Was
it not such as was vsuall by the lawes of the Romanes,
for such hainous offences, as were vniustlye layde to his
charge?
                  Finally was not the place where he suffered within the circuiteConclusions of this first prose with application of the former resōs.
of the Romane Empire? May & not then iustly affirme
that he was crucified at Rome, when by the Romane Iudge he
was condemned for a crime against the Romane state, & executed
by a kinde of death appointed by the Romane lawes, & in a
place of the Romane dominion.
                  As for the Iewes, they had at that time no authoritie to put
any man to death, as they confesse themselues, when Pilat

he hath defe

                     ued to die.
                  As touching to cause,The cause although they accused him of blasphemy,
because he made himselfe the son of God, yet could he not be
condemned for that, because Pilate wild admit no accusation,
but such as conteined a crime against the Romane lawes.
                  
                     And as for the death of the crosse,The kind of death. it is manifest to be prope

                  And that the Angell in that placeThe place by no meanes can vnderstand
Hierusalem, it is manifest by these reasons: First that
he calleth it the greate Citie, which tearme coulde neuer
bée spoken of Hierusalem. Also vs calleth it Sodoma and Aegypt,
which was the Sea of the monsterons beast Antichrist,
which in other places is often called Babylon, &c. Adde héerevnto
that Hierusalem the place where Christ suffered, was
vtterly destroyed in Saint Iohns time, which wrote this reuelation.
                  For the second proofe,The secōd proofe. sée the. 13. Chapter of this Reuelation,
and the. 17. chapter, where this euill shapen beast is described
with. 7. heads &. 10 hornes. Also sée Daniel the 7. Chapter, describing
the foure beastes, especially the fourth beast, which all
men must confesse to be the Monarch of Rome, which is the
fourth Monarch.
                  The third Argument or proofeThe third proofe. is taken out of the 17. chapter,
verse. 9. of this Reuelation. Where the Angell expounding
to Saint Iohn the mysterie of the beast with seauen heads,
declareth in verye plaine wordes, that the seauen heads do signifie
seauen hills, wherevpon the woman sitteth: which al writers,
Poets, historiers, cosmographers with one consent do confesse
to be Rome, which is builded vpon 7. hills,7. Hills. whose names
are these: Palatinus, Capitolinus, Auentinus, Exquilinus, Viminalis,
Quirinalis, & Caelius. The Poet Virgil describeth Rome
with this Periphrasis in his Georgikes.
                  
                  Septem quae vna sibi muro circundedit arces.
                  Which hath compassed. 7. hils within her walls.
                  The fourth and last proofeTh iiii. proofe. is taken out of the. 17. chapter of
this Reuelation, the last verse, where the Angell expoundeth,
that the woman which Saint Iohn sawe (which was the great
whoore Babylon) is that great Citie which hath cominion, ouer
the kings of the earth. And what man is so impudent, as to
saye, that anie other Citie in Saint Iohns time had dominion
ouer the kings of the earth, but Rome.

that the opinion of many in his time was, that séeing this name
Lateinos, which is in English the Latin man or Romane, in the
numerall Gréeke letters conteineth this number, that Antichrist
must be sought at Rome his words are these: Sed a Lateinos,
nomen fex centorum sexaginta sex numerorum, &c. Et
valde verisimile est quoniam verissim regnum hoc habet vocabulum,
Latini enim sunt qui nunc regnant Also (saith he) this
name Lateinos conteining the number of 666. is thought to be
the name of Antichrist, & it is very like so to be, for that which
most vndoubtedly is a kingdom hath that name: for they be Latines
which now doe reigne.

                  Of the same iudgement is S. Hierome writing vpon ye same
place of Paul vnto Aglasia in ye eleuenth question,The iiii. Doctour. whose words
are these: Nec vult aperti, &c. Neither will he openly say, that
the Romane Empire should be destroied, which they y• gouerne
it thinke to be euerlasting: wherefore according to the reuelation
of S. Iohn, In ye forehead of the purple whoore, ther is written
a name of blasphemy, which is Rome euerlasting.
                  The same Hierome in his. 13.Verba eiusdem. booke of his Commentaries of
the Prophesie of Esay vpon the 24. chapter writeth thus: Licet
ex eo quod iuxta septuaginta, &c. Forasmuch as the seauentie
Interpreters, write not the daughter Babylon, but the daughter
of Babylon, some do interpret the rest, not Babylon in Chaldea,
but the citie of Rome, which in the reuelation of S. Iohn, &
the Epistle of Peter is specially called Babylon.

sancto,
                     Verba eiusdem. which he translated out of Greeke into Latin writing
to Pauinianus, he vttereth these words: Cum in Babylone
versarer, &c. Of late (saith he) when I was in Babylon, & was
an inhabitant of the purple harlot, & liued after the lawes of ye
                     Romaines, I thought to intreate somewhat of the holy Ghost.

her,Marcella. is this, that as Bethleem whither he would haue her
to repaire, is situated in the holy land, and the place consecrated
to the birth of Christ: so Rome where she desired to remaine,
was the Babylonicall harlot, according to the Reuelation of
Saint Iohn, appointed for the birth of Antichrist, which there
should arise and exercise tyrannye, and from thence shoulde

deceiue the whole world with his wicked wiles.

                  YE shall doe no labour therein, but hallowe the
sabboth,Iere. 17. 22 as I commanded your fathers. ¶The
foundation of the faith is to beléeue Gods premise,
& that he made the whole world, & doth also
gouerne it, & further, that he knoweth & will
iudge all things, &c. Those things did ye law require,
in keping of the sabboth, to confesse both with word and
signe, & to giue diligent héed to the hearing & interpreting of the
law, to thinke of the glory of God, & to reléeue the faithful soule
with the foode of the word, to minister occasion also vnto ye simple,
that they likewise might attempt such things in their houses
amongst their household folks, to be pitifull ouer the wearines
of such neighbours as laboured sore al the wéeke long & reléeue
them, to attend & giue héed to the exercises of the spirit, & to the
consolation and comforting of their neighbours, not onely to
absteine from outward works, and fulfill their appetites and
lustes, for that did the Lorde forbid. The Sabboth should bée
applyed to the lawfull seruing of God, not to sinfulnesse and
wantonnesse. It is commaunded to be sanctified, and not polluted
and defiled with naughtinesse. To God alone must wée
also kéepe it, and call on his name: Other Gods or Gods fellowes,
ought we not to enquire of, nor fall downe vnto them:
But when such occasions come as turne our rest into occupation
& labour, then ought we remember that the Sabboth was
ordeined for man,Mar. 3. 27. not man for the Sabboth. So that in the
meane season, the feare of God, and the charitie towards our
neighbour (which are the chiefe and principall things in the obseruation
of the Sabboth) be not lightly regarded.

                  God rested the seauenth day.Gen. 2. 2. ¶What we should learne in
this,Exo. 28. 8. we may plainly sée in the commaundement: Kéepe holye
the Sabboth day: for that day was instituted for this cause:
because then God rested from his works, & in that day a rest is
commaunded vs, that in it we should do no manner of worke,
and why (déerely beloued) shall we rest? God is not pleased
with idlenesse, he will not haue vs like the idle men, y• in the
ninth houre of the day stand still idle in the market, but God
commaunded vs to kéepe that day holy vnto him, which is to
serue him in it, and not our selues.

was instituted, not for vaine sports and pastimes, but that vpon
that day the people should giue themselues to praier, to read &

               SACRAMENT.
               
                  What Sacrament is.
                  A Sacrament saith S. Austen,
                     Augustin is the signe of an holy thing.
¶If it be the signe of an holy thing, then it is not the very
thing it selfe, which it doth signifie.
I. Frith.
                  
                  It séemeth to me that a Sacrament is an outwarde signe,
wherewith the Lord sealeth to our consciences the promises of
his good will towards vs, to sustaine the weaknesse of our faith.
And we againe on our behalfes, doe testifie our godlinesse towards
him, as well before him and the Angells, as before men.
We may also with more briefenesse define it otherwise: As
to call it a testimonie of Gods fauour towards vs, confirmed by
an outward signe, with a mutuall testifieng of our godlinesse
towards him. Whether of these definitions, it differeth nothing
in sense from the definition of S. Augustine, which teacheth
that a Sacrament is a visible signe of an holy thing, or a visible
forme of an inuisible grace: but it doeth better and more certainely
expresse the thing it selfe, for whereas in the briefenesse
there is some darknesse, wherin many of the vnskilfull sort are
deceiued, I thought good in more wordes, to giue a fuller sentence,
that there should remaine no doubt.
Cal. in his
Instit. 4. b. chap. 14. sect. 1.
                  
                  A Sacrament as S. Austen defineth it, is a signe of an holy
thing.It cannot bee both the signe and the thing signified. But if the Sacrament be Christs body (as the Papists
say it is) then can it not be a Sacrament, that is the signe of an
holy thing, for it is the holy thing it selfe. So that they must either
deny ye sacrament to be ye body & bloud of Christ, either els
the Sacrament therof. For one thing cannot be both the signe &
the thing signified, because they be in that respect most contrary
the one to the other.
Crowley.
                  
                  A Sacrament is a visible signe ordeined of Iesus Christ, as
a seale to confirme vs the better in the faith of the promises,
the which God hath made vs, of our saluation in him.

Sacrament, is a signe representing such appointments and
promises, as the Raine-bow representeth the promise made to
Noe, that God will no more drowne the world.
Tindale.
                  
                  This word Sacrament, is as much to say, as an holy signe,
and representeth alway some promise of God, as in ye olde Testament,
God ordeined that the Raine-bow should represent
and signifie vnto all men an Oth that God sware to Noe, and
to all men after him, that he would no more drowne the
worlde with water, so the Sacrament of the body and
bloud of Christ, hath a promise annexed, which the Priest should
declare in the English tongue: This is my body that is broken
for you: This is my bloud that is shed for many vnto the
forgiuenesse of sinnes: This doe in the remembraunce of mée

                        •
                     aith Christ. Luke. 22. 19. and 1. Cor. 11. 24. If when thou seest the
sacrament, or eatest his body, or drinkest his bloud, thou haue
this promise fast in thy heart (that his body was slaine, and his
bloud shed for thy sins) & beléeuest it, so art thou saued & iustified
therby: if not, so helpeth it thée not, though thou herest a thousand
Masses in a day, or though thou dost nothing els al thy life
long, then eat his body & drink his bloud: no more then it shuld
help thée in a dead thirst to behold a bush at a Tauerne dore, if
thou knewest not therby, ye ther wer wine wtin to be solde.
Tin.
                  
                  This word sacrament, did not signifie ye same with the olde
Writers, as it doth now in ye Church, for they call a sacrament,
the oth or religious bond, which was of ye strength of an oth. So
they called y• souldiers oth, wherby they sware when they shuld
go a warfare for the Common wealth,The souldiers sacrament. that they would serue
faithfully, The souldiers sacrament, as we may perceiue by Seruius
and Vigetius, in their bookes of warre matters.
                  
                     Augustine defineth a sacrament in this sort. The visible sacrifice
(saith he) is the sacrament of the inuisible sacrifice, that is
to say ye holy signe. And againe: A sacrament (saith he) is a visible
forme of an inuisible grace, &c.
Musc. fol. 272.
                  
                  S. Austen describeth a sacrament thus: The word of God
comming to the Element maketh ye sacrament. And againe, in another
place he saith: A sacrament is a thing, wherin the power
of God vnder the forme of visible things,Maister of the sentence
                           •
                        . doth worke secret
saluation. And the Master of the sentences doeth describe a sacrament
none otherwise: A Sacrament (saith he) is an inuisible

grace, and hath a visible forme: and by this inuisible grace
(saith he) I meane remission of sinnes.

as materiall bread feedeth the body: so the body of Christ nailed
vpon the Crosse, embraced and eaten by faith, féedeth the soule.
The like representation is also made in the Sacrament of Baptime,
that as our bodies is washed cleane with water, so is our
soules cleane with Christs bloud.

                  The same Christ that did adorne and beautifie the Table is
now present, and he doth consecrate the same also. For it is
not men that doth make these things that be set before vs, of
the consecration of y• Lords table, to be y• body & bloud of Christ:
but ye same Christ which was crucified for vs. The words are
pronounced by the mouth of the Priest, but the things are consecrated
by the power & grace of God. This is (saith he) my body,
by this word are the things y• are set before vs consecrated.
And euen as y• voice which saith, grow & be multiplied, & replenish
y• earth, was but once spoken, but yet doth at all times by
the work of nature, féele effect to generation: so that voice also
was but once spoken, & yet it giueth sure staye to the sacrifice,
throughout al y• tables of the Church euen to this daye, & from
henceforth til his comming. ¶Chrisostome doth héere compare y•
words y• Christ spake at y• insitution of his supper, to ye words
y• God spake, when he appointed man to be multiplied by generation,
affirmeth y• the same power y• worketh stil in ye one, doth
stil work in ye other also. Not to charm out ye substance of bread

y• generation of mankind is continued according to ye first voice,
so ye inuisible graces y• wer promised, by ye death & bloudshedding

Sacrifice? Thou seest what diligence he gaue that we shuld continually

they be indéede, but what they signifie.

                     Aug. con. lit. Per. li. 2. ca. 47. shooteth not
at this But, whether Christs verye naturall bodie be receiued
with our mouths, but whether the Sacraments in generall bee
receiued both of good and bad. And he declareth, that it is all
one water whether Symon Peter, or Symon Magus be christened
in it: all one Table of the Lord and one Cup, whether Peter
sup thereat or Iudas: all one Oyle,The euill minister or receiuer hurteth not the Sact. whether Dauid or Saule
were annoynted therewith. Wherefore he concludeth thus:
Memento ergo sacramentis Dei, &c. Remember (saith S. Austen
that the manners of euill men hinder not the sacraments
of God, that either they vtterly be not, or be lesse holy: but they
hinder the euill men themselues, so y• they haue the sacraments
to witnesse of their damnation, not to helpe of their saluation.
                  And all processe spoken there by S. Austen, is spoken chiefely
of Baptime against the Donatists, which said y• Baptime was
naught, if either the Minister or receiuer were naught. Against
whom S. Austen concludeth that the sacraments themselues be
holy, and be all one, whether the Minister or receiuer bée good
or bad.

                     Ireneus, S. Agustine, and other auncient Doctors, yea and
the Canon law doth teach, there must be both the outward Element,
which in Baptime is water, and in the Lords supper,
bread and wine, and the outward grace, as the two principalls
thereof: Take away the bread and wine, and then it is
no sacrament.
               
               
                  How the sacrament is our body.
                  Because Christ hath suffered for vs,Augu. in ser. de sacra. feria. Pas. he hath betaken vnto
vs in this sacrament his body and bloud, which he hath made also
euen our selues, for we also are made his body, & by his mercie
we are euen the same thing that we receiue. And after hée
saith: Now in the name of Christ ye are come, as a man wold
say to the Chalice of the Lord, there are ye vpon the Table, and
there are ye in the Chalice. ¶Héere ye may sée that the Sacrament

is our body: and yet it is not our naturall body, but in a
mysterie.

which saith: Ye are the body of Christ & members. 1. Cor. 12. 27.
Therefore if ye be the body of Christ & members, your misterie
is put vpon the Lords Table, ye receiue the mysterie of the
Lord, vnto that you are, you aunswere Amen, and in aunswering
subscribe vnto it. ¶Héere we may sée, the Sacrament is also
our body, and yet is not our naturall body, but onely our body
in a mysterie, that is to say, a figure, signe, memorial, or representation
of our body. For as the bread is made of many
graines or cornes, so we (though we be many) are bread & one
body, & for this propertie and similitude, it is called our body, &
beareth the name of the very thing, which it doth represent and
signifie.

                  As the sacrament of the Altar is our body, euen so it is Christs.
                  First vnderstand ye, that in y• wine which is called Christs
bloud, is admixed water, which doth signifie the people y• are redéemed
with his bloud: so that y• head, which is Christ, is not
without his body, which is the faithful people, nor ye body without
the head. Now if the wine when it is consecrate, be turned
bodely into Christs bloud, then it is also necessary that the water
which is admixed, be bodely turned into ye bloud of ye faithfull
people: for wheras is one consecration, must folow one operation:
& whereas is like reson, ther must follow like mysterie.
But whatsouer is signified by the water, as concerning ye faithfull
people, is taken spiritually, therefore whatsoeuer is spoken
of the bloud in the wine, must also néedes be taken spiritually,
This is Bartrams reason vpon a. 700. yeares since.
               
               
                  How in the sacrament, there can be no accident
without his substance.
                  In ye sacrament of ye Altar (saith I. Puruay)I. Puruay. after y• consecration
ther is not, neither can be any accidentAccident

ther verely remaineth ye same substance, & the very visible & incorruptible
bread, & likewise ye very same wine, y• which before y•
consecratiō wer set vpon ye Altar, to be consecrate by y• Priest:

so great strength to the water, to touch the body & wash ye soule,
but by the word making it: not because it is spoken, but because
it is beléeued. For in the very word it selfe, the sound which passeth

                  The wonderWonder. is not how God worketh in the outward visible
sacrament, but his meruailous worke, is in the worthy receiuers
of the sacraments. The wonderful worke of God is not
in the water, which onely washeth the body, but God by his omnipotent
power worketh wonderfully in the receiuers therof,
scouring, washing, and making them cleane inwardly, & as it
were new men, and celestiall creatures. This haue all olde Authors
wondred at, this wonder passeth the capacitie of all mens
wits, how damnation is turned into saluation, and of the sonne
of the Diuell condemned into hell, is made the sonne of God,
an inheritour of heauen. This wonderfull worke of God, all
men may meruaile and wonder at: but no creature is able sufficiently
to comprehend it. And as this is wondred at in the sacrament
of Baptime, how he that was subiect to death, receiueth
lyfe by Christ and his holy spirite: so is this wondred at
in the sacrament of Christs holy Table, how the same lyfe is
continued and endured for euer, by continual feeding of Christs
flesh and his bloud. And these wonderfull workes of God toward

bene God, he would first haue espyed their poyson, because hée
cannot be deceiued. And because he cannot deceiue, he would
not haue poysoned the Emperour who mistrusted nothing.

                  What a Sacrifice is.
                  A Sacrifice is a voluntary action, wherein we worship God,
and offer vnto him somewhat, wherby we testifie his chiefe
dignitie and dominion, and our seruitude and submission
towardes him.

sinners from the wrath of God, which doeth onely pertaine to
our Sauiour Iesus Christ, whereof all the Leuiticall sacrifices
were but shadowes & signes. The Sacrifice of praise or thanks
giuing, is all the workes of the faithful, wherewith they praise
and laud God, and labour, to be ioined with him, &c. S. Austen
himselfe doth expound it. August. lib. 10. de. ciuita. Dei. cap. 6.

or mercifull sacrifice, that is to say, such a sacrifice as pacifieth
Gods wrath and indignation, and obtaineth mercie and

forgiuenesse for all our sinnes, and is the raunsome of our redemption
from euerlasting damnation. And although in y• olde
Testament there were certaine sacrifices called by that name,
yet in very deede, there is but one such sacrifice, whereby our
sinnes be pardoned, and Gods mercie and fauour obtained,

                  No man (saith S. Paule) can offer vp a greater sacrifice then
himselfe. The Priests therefore cannot offer vp Christ in sacrifice,
because Christ being offered vp, must néedes be the greatest
sacrifice, and so can he not be when a Priest sacrificeth him
selfe, for if the Priest sacrificed himselfe, he should be y• greatest
sacrifice y• he could offer, for no man can offer a greater sacrifice
thē himself: yea god requireth none other sacrifice but our selues,

as writeth S. Paul: Giue your selues a liuing sacrifice to God.
And the Psalmist: The sacrifice that God accepteth is a penitent
spirit, a contrite and an humble heart. Whereby it is manifest,Psa. 51. 17
that the Congeegation redeemed by the sacrifice offered on
the Crosse, doth not, nor cannot offer by the sacrifice of Christs
body, for (as S. Paule writeth) he cannot be offred vp but be dyeth.Heb. 9. 28
Wherefore he offered vp himselfe once for all, because hee
could not dye but once, &c.

                  The difference betweene a sacrifice & a sacrament.
                  If a man say of the sacrament of Christs body and bloud, that
it is a sacrificeThe Sacrament is no sacrifice. as well for the dead as for the quicke, and therfore
the very déede it selfe iustifieth and putteth away sinne: I
answere, that a sacrifice is the slaieng of the body of a beast or a
man: wherfore if it be a sacrifice, then is Christs body ther slain
and his bloud there shed, but that is not so. And therefore it is
properly no sacrifice but a sacrament, and a memoriall of that
euerlasting sacrifice once for all, which he offered vpon y• crosse,
now a. 15. hundred yeres agoe, and preacheth only to them that

               SACRILEDGE.
               
                  What Sacriledge is.
                  SAcriledge is rashly to touch or to vsurpe vnto himselfe holy
things, which are dedicated vnto God, due either by the
name of a vowe or els of a cursse. The Iewes had a Commaundement
giuen them, that they should not spare Idolls: for
their dutie was to ouerthrow and destroy all things pertaining
vnto them. But they being led by couetousnesse, reserued those
things vnto themselues, and tourned them to their owne proper
commodities. So sinned Achan & also Saul, when he had ouercome
Amalech. Contrariwise, Moses gaue an excellent example
of vertue,Exo. 32. 20 when he not onely brake the golden Calfe, but
also did beate it into powder, and threw it into the riuer. For
if the reliques of the Idoll had remained stil, peraduenture the
Israelites, as they were outragious, woulde haue worshipped
them. Indéede the Publike-wealth and our Magistrates maye
take away those things which are superstitious, and conuert the
prices of them to good and godly vses. But this thing is not
permitted to priuate men. But the Iewes were generally forbidde,
that they should not saue such things, especially as were
vowed by a cursse.

                  What the Saduces were.
                  THe Saduces were such men, as cloked their religion vnder
a glorious name: for Saducei is as much to say as iust or
holy. They taught y• ther was neither Angel, spirit nor life after
death: that God gaue the lawe onely for this, that honestly
and quietly we should liue, receiuing of God héere in this lyfe,
the reward of Iustice. They interpreted the Scriptures according
to the iudgement of mans reason: neither any other thing
would they heare. And as concerning that which pertained to
the manner of their liuing, they were plaine Epicures. A wonderfull
thing to be heard, y• such Ethnike opinions should créepe
in, among the peculiar people of God, & that so farre, that openly
they were not afraid to teach, & constantly to affirme, that after
this lyfe, there remained none other life.
                  The Saduces calling themselues after the Etimologie of their
name, iust men, affirmed as Iosephus writeth (lib. 2. bell. Iud. cap. 7.) that man had free-will, that it lay in man to doe good or
bad. Mat. 22. and Luke. Act. 23. say: that they denie the resurrertion,
affirming ther was neither Angell nor spirit.

because he knew not the fault that was layed vnto
him. Some say it was one of the instruments, where with all
the Psalmes before which it is set, were sung. Some think that
it is a certaine kinde of melody.

                  The Hebrue Interpreters agree not among themselues vppon
this word Sigaion. For some take it for an instrument of
Musicke. Unto some it séemeth to be a note to sing a song by Other
some thinke it, to be the beginning of some common carol,
according to the time, whereof Dauids will was to haue this
Palme sung. And other interpret the Hebrue worde to signifie
delightfulnes. In my iudgment (saith Caluine) y• second opinion
is most allowable, namely y• it was some kind of tune or song:
as if a man would terme it a Saphicke or Phalentian verse.

Howbeit I force not a matter of so lyght importaunce.

their garments confessing and perswading them that they were
not Gods, forbad such things to be done vnto them. This appeareth
also in the Angells, as we read in the Apocalips. The
Angell forbidding himselfe to be worshipped, and saieng to him

                  If the Papist will haue this place: Praise the Lord in his
Saints, to be lyke vnto this: Call vpon the Saints of the Lord:
Then by as good a reason we may say, that the Trumpet, the
Uioll, and the Harpe, &c. ought to bée called vpon. For it followeth
immediatly after: Praise him in the sound of the trumpet,
in the violl, and in the harpe: but the Catholike veritie &
truth,
doth both read and vnderstand the words of the Prophet
after this sort: Praise the Lord in his Sanctuarie,Praise god in his Sanctuary or in his holynesse:
that is, praise him that dwelleth in heauen: for in another
place he sayth, Lift vp your hands vnto the Sanctuarie, &
praise the Lord, which is as much as if he shoulde haue sayde:
Lift vp your hands vnto heauen & praise the Lord, & giue him
thāks for his benefits. Whervnto he addeth with what instrumēts
they were wont to stir vp the hearts of the people to sing
praises, and to bée thankefull vnto the Lorde. But now vnder

is done in earth.
                  S. Austen in his booke De cura pro mortuis agenda, doth
plainely affirme, y• the soules of y• Saintes that be in heauen,
doe not know what the liuing doe heere in earth, prouing it by
example of his owne Mother, and by this place of Esay: Thou
art our Father.Dead Saints knowe nothing. 
                     Abraham knoweth vs not, neither is Israel
acquainted with vs. And also by Iosias, where God promised
that he should dye, and not sée those calamities, plagues & miseries,

which he threatened should come vpon that place, & vpon
the people.
               
               
                  How Saintes cannot impart their righteousnesse
to other.
                  S. Hierome saith, the righteousnes of the righteous shalbe vpon
him, and the wickednesse of ye wicked shall remaine vpon him,
euery man shal die through his own sin, & euery man shal liue
through his owne righteousnesse. The Iewes doe say in vaine,
Abraham is our Father, sith that they haue not the works of
Abraham. If we shuld put our trust in any, let vs put our trust
in God, Cursed bee euery man that putteth his trust in men,
although they be Saintes, although they be Prophets.
                  Wée reade, Put not your trust in men. Againe: Better it
is to trust in God then in Princes, not onely in the Princes
of the worlde, but in the Princes of the Church, which
if they be righteous, they shall deliuer their owne soules
onely.

                  This entising argument, is but a blinde reason and mans
wit. It is not lyke in the kingdome of the world, as it is in the
kingdome of God and Christ. With kinges for the most part
we haue no acquaintaunce nor promise. They be also most
commonly mercilesse. Moreouer if they promise, they are yet
men and vnconstant as are other people and as vntrue. But
with God if we haue beléefe we are accompted, and haue an
open way vnto him, by the doore Christ, which is neuer shut,
but through vnbeléefe, neither is there any porter to kéepe any
man out. By him saith Paule. Ephe. 2. 18. That is to saye, by
Christ we haue an open way into the Father, so are ye now no
more straungers and forriners (saith he) but citizens with the
Saints, and of the household of God. God had also made vs promises,
and hath sworne, yea, hath made a testament or a couenant,
& hath bound himselfe, & hath sealed his Obligation with
Christs bloud, and confirmed it with miracles. He is also mercifull
and kinde, and complaineth that wée will not come to
him: He is mightie and able to performe that he promiseth: He
is true and cannot be but true, as he cannot bée but GOD,

therefore it is not like with the king and God.

                  Beholde how they flye from God, as from a tyrant mercilesse
whom a man counteth most mercifull to him, he soonest
flyeth. But these techers dare not come to God, why? For they
are the children of Cain. If the Saints loue whō God hateth,
then God and his Saints are diuided. When thou praiest to
the Saintes, how doe they know, except God whom thou countest
mercilesse tell them? If God be so cruell and so hateth thée,
it is not lykely that hée will tell the Saintes that thou praiest
vnto them, &c.

                  This is a great blasphemy to Christs blessed bloud, for if
Saintes bee necessarie to be mediatours for vs, then is Christ
vnsufficient. For Philosophers did neuer put two causes wher
one was sufficient. And if any thing be giuen vs for Saints
sakes, thē be not al things giuē vs for Christs sake. The which

man,8. Tim. 2. 5. the man Christ Iesus, the which hath giuen himselfe for
the redemption of all men. ¶Héere he sayth, there is but one
mediatour betwéene God and man. Where there is but one,
there cannot Saints come in. Moreouer Saints bée men, Ergo
they must haue a mediatour for themselues, and than they cannot
be mediatours for other men. Moreouer the mediatour betwéene
God and man is called Christ Iesus. Now is there no
Saint that hath that name. If there bee none, then is ther none
that can vsurpe this office without blaspheming of Christ. Furthermore,
he hath redeemed vs without the helpe of Saints, &
why shal he not be wholy mediatour without Saints. Redemption
is the chiefe act of a mediatour.

mightely for vs with mightie desires that cannot be expressed
with tongue. ¶If the spirit of God doe make intercession for
vs, then haue we no neede of other mediatours. For he is able
to obteine all things for vs, and hath taken this office on him
for vs. It were a great rebuke to him that Saints should be set
in his stéede, & ioyned with him in office, as though he were vnsufficient.

these words of the Apostle: And some of you were such, but ye

&c. If he call them sanctified, let euery one of the faithfull say,
I am a Saint. This is not the pride of him y• is puffed vp, but y•

art a Saint of thy selfe, thou art a proud man. Againe, beeing
faithfull in Christ,Wherfore the faithfull are Saintes. if thou say thou art not a Saint, thou art ingrate
& vnthankfull. Say vnto thy God, I am a Saint because
thou hast sanctified me, because I haue receiued it not because
I had it: because thou hast giuen it, not because I deserued it.
For on y• other side thou beginnest to do iniury vnto thy Lord

many as are baptised in Christ, are apparelled wt him. If they
be made mēbers of his body, & say y• they are not Saints, they

costly & hard to be gotten. The walls were in many places set
with precious stones, and the pillers of Ceder plated ouer with

Salomons pallaice was made of Iuorie: No, of Iuorie there is
no mention, and no meruaile, for Iuorie is onely the bone of an
Elephants tooth. So that it is not lykely, that such plentie of

the Iewes by the law prescribed by Moses to them that were
vnder the lawe.Salt in Baptime. If it had bene Christs pleasure y• his ministers
should haue looked backe vnto the rites of Moses, & taken out of
them such as they listed, he would rather haue had declared the
same, or els the Apostle wold haue done it, wherefore our opinion
is (saith Mus

to be attributed vnto y• wil worship of the Bishops.

                  A firme Argument for the certeintie of our saluation.
                  ANd seeing it is sayd, that faith shall be imputed vnto vs vnto
righteousnesse, as it was in times past imputed vnto Abraham,
we haue a most firme argument of the certeintie of
saluation. For as Abraham behaued himselfe towardes the
promise of God, as touching that he should haue issue.Sure of our saluation. So must
we behaue our selues towardes the promises of the remission
of sinnes. But he was certeine, neither doubted hée: whereof
we ought to be certeine of the saluation promised vnto vs, and
by no meanes to doubt thereof. This reason let vs holde fast,
and not suffer it to slip from vs.
Pet. Mar. vpon the Rom. fol. 96.
                  
                  As the holy Scriptures teacheth vs, we ought to hope, & such
is the nature of hope not to confound, we may manifestly infer,
that we ought not to doubt of our saluation. There are which
pretend, ye their doubt héereof springeth, for y• they are vncertein
whether they shal perseuer vnto y• end or no. But these mē shuld
cōsider, y• we ought alwais to pray for perseuerāce. For as saith
Cipriane, whom Augustine followeth, in all ye things which we
aske in the Lords prayer, is included perseuerāce. And as Iames
teacheth, we must aske without doubting, wherfore it is manifest,
y• we must by no meanes doubt of perseuerance, & especially

seeing we haue in our hearts the holy Ghost, alwayes bearing
an excellent testimonie vnto vs thereof. For as Saint Paule
saith in this Epistle:Rom. 8. 16 It is the spirit that beareth witnesse to
our spirit that we are the sonnes of God, and 
                        •
                     e which hath not

that he is sure, that neither life, nor death, nor principalitie, nor
power, can pluck him from y• loue of God, namely from ye loue,
wherewith God loued him.

                  How without the Church is no light or
saluation.
                  S. Cipriane De simplicitate praelatorum saith. Whosoeuer is
separated from the Church, is ioyned to an adulterous church, y•
same man is separated from ye promises of ye church, neither perteineth
he to Christs merits, which hath left y• church of Christ.
He is a straūger, he is vncleane, he is an enimy. He cannot now
haue God his father, who hath not the church his mother.No saluation out of the Church. If he
may scape that was out of the Arke of Noe, he may also escape
that is abroad out of the church. He must néeds be a most wicked
man, whosoeuer he be that leaueth his owne country, & the
fellowship of very good men, and falleth away to the enimies.
Lactantius therefore most truely sayd: It is onely the catholike
church, which receiueth true religion. Héere is the fountaine of
truth: This is the household of faith. This is y• temple of God:
into ye which if one enter not, or out of ye which if any depart, he
is excluded from the hope of saluation & life euerlasting: for our
sauiour said, that out of the sheepfolde, life is not to be sound.

& frée will of God: And the second cause are y• merits
of Christ, for he died for the saluation of mankinde: but this is

to God and man, and of things diuine and worldly,
which they that had gotten, were called Sapientes, that is, men
of perfect knowledge, vertue and honestie. For of right knowledge
consequently ensueth honestie of life.

we should thinke the Diuell were so called the Prince of the

and earth: but the world (for he is said to be the Prince of
this world)Prince of this world is saide to be in wicked men, which are dispearsed
throughout the whole compasse of the earth. And againe ye same
Augustine in his 1. chap. De agone christia. saith: The Prince
of this world is cast out, not that he is cast out of the worlde,
but out of their mindes, which cleaue vnto the word of God,
and loue not the world whereof he is Prince: because he hath
dominion ouer them, which loue temporal goods, which are contained
in this visible world, not for ye he is Lord of this world,
but Prince of those concupiscences, whereby euery thing is coueted
that is transitory. By this concupiscence the Diuel raigneth

Satan came also among them. ¶Thinke not that God sometime
appeareth to the Angells, and sometime not, for the good
Angels do alwaies see ye face of God: neither communeth God
either with the Angels or with the Diuel, with bodely speach,
but the holy ghost in the scripture, speketh many things vnto vs,
according to our féeling, and vseth a manner of speaking familiar
vnto vs, attributing, appearing, speaking, enquiring and aunswering
to God and to Angells, which thing man onely vseth,
to the intent that we thereby, may the easlier perceiue his meaning.
The comming of the Angells héere, is none other thing.
then to giue accompts of the office enioyned them, which they
giue, knowing that God seeth with what trust they did it, and
to giue thankes and waite for their reward. They came (saith
Origen) honouring, magnifieng, praising, giuing thankes. Of
Satan also writeth he thus: He came neither with gooing too,
or comming in, but he came in thought, counsell and most wicked
desire to accuse the righteous before God: his thought and
desire are taken for a comming. The Diuell then is counted
to haue come into the sight of God, not that the most wicked
came indeede in the sight of the good God, but because his cruell
and most wicked thoughts came into the sight of God. And thus
euen now a dayes also commeth the Diuell with them into
the sight of God, in that he daily accuseth, findeth faults, persecuteth
and troubleth the godly.

the Dragon the old Serpent which is the Diuell, & Satanas, &
bound him for a thousand yeares, and put him in the bottomles
dungeon, & shut him vp, & signed him with his seale, that hée
should no more seduce the Gentiles, till a thousand yeres were
expired, and after that he must be loosed againe for a litle shew
of time. And I saw seates, and they sate vpon them, and iudgement
was giuen vnto them, and the soules I sawe of them
which were beheaded for the testimonie of Iesus. ¶By these
words of ye Reuelation héere recited, three special times are to
be noted First, the being abroad of Satan to deceiue the world.
Second, the binding vp of him. Thirdly, the loosing out of him againe,
after a thousand yeres consumate for a time. Concerning
the interpretation of which times, I sée the common opinion of
many to be deceiued, by ignoraunce of Histories and state of
things done in the Church: supposing that the comming vp of
Satan for a thousand yeares, spoken of in the Reuelation, was
ment from ye time of Christ our Lord. Wherein I graunt that
spiritually the strength & dominion of Satan, in accusing and
condemning vs for sinne, was cast downe at the passion, and by
the passion of Christ our Sauiour, and locked vp not onely for a
thousand yeare, but for euer and euer. Albeit, as touching his
malitious hatred and fury of that Serpent, against the outward
bodyes of Christs poore Saints (which is the héele of Christ) to
afflict and torment the Church outwardly: that I iudge to bée
meant in the Reuelation of Saint Iohn, not to bée restrayned,
till the ceasing of those terrible persecutions of the Primitiue
Church. At which time it pleased God to pittie the sorrowful
affliction of his poore flocke, being so long vnder persecution
(the space of 300. yeares) and so to asswage their griefes and
torments, which is meant by binding vp of Satan, worker
of all these mischiefes. Understanding thereby, that for
so much as the Diuell, Prince of this worlde, hadde now

by the death of Christ the sonne of God, lost all his power and
interest against the soule of man, shuld turne his furious rage
and mallice which he had to Christ, against the people of Christ.
Which is ment by the héele of the seede. Gen. 3. 15. in tormenting
their outward bodies. Which yet should not be for euer, but for
a determinate time, when as it should please the Lord, to bridle
the malice and snaffle the power of the olde Serpent, and
giue rest vnto his Church, for the terme of a thousand yeares.
                  Which time béeing expired, the said Serpent should be suffered
loose againe for a certaine or a small time.

that loueth God, hath a commaundement (as S. Iohn saith in
the. 4. chapter of his first Epistle ver. 21.) to loue his neighbour
also. Whom if thou haue offended, thou, must make him amends
or satisfaction, or at the least way if thou be not able, aske him
forgiuenesse, and if he will haue mercie of God, he is bounde to
forgiue thée. If he will not, yet God forgiueth thée, if thou thus
submit thy selfe. But to God ward Christ is a perpetuall & an

welcome, as thou maist sée by the similitude of the riotous son,
Lu. 15. If thou be lepen out of sanctuary, come in again. If thou
be fallen from the way of truth, come thereto againe and thou
art safe. If thou be gone astray, come into field againe, & the

enioined by the Priest after the Auricular confession And héere
they make much adoe, that the satisfaction be neither lesse nor
lighter, then counteruaileth the waight of the sinne. This doctrine
of satisfaction doth excéedingly darken the clearenesse of
the grace of Christ, it doth make mens consciences either falsely
assured, when they suppose that they haue satisfied: either it
doth piteously torment them, when they cannot tell by what
time they haue satisfied in the sight of God for one sinne, much
lesse for all their sinnes. Beside that, it hath not opened one gap,
but all dores, windowes and arches, &c. to the Popes mark

to gape vpon pardons, and for the traffike of Priests Masses, to
deliuer soules out of Purgatorie: wherefore all godly doe worthely
abhorre it. The doctrine of the Gospell doth denounce
vnto vs pardon of our sinnes by the bloud of Christ, by the shedding
whereof, there is satisfaction made, not onely for ours, but
for the sinnes of all the world. And wheresoeuer this grace doth
take place, that satisfaction hath nothing to doe, we could beare
with them if they said, that like as the faith in Christ, is reputed
for righteousnesse to the beléeuers, according to the example
of Abraham, so repentaunce is of mercie, and frankly imputed
for satisfaction. As we maye perceiue it was in the prod

                     gall
sonne, whose returne and repentaunce, his father of his right
fatherly clemencie, did accept for a most sufficient satisfaction,
and sought nothing further of him. This meaning of satisfaction
doth derogate nothing from the grace of God, but doth excéedingly
aduaunce it. It maketh nothing for the gaine and iuglings
of the Popes markets, but it maketh much to the quieting
of our consciences. Wherefore we will sticke vnto it, and

                  Of two manner of satisfactions.
                  There are two manner of satisfactions, the one is to God,
the other to my neighbour. To God cannot all the world make
satisfaction for one sinne: insomuch, as if euery grasse of the
ground were a man, as holy as euer was Paule or Peter, and
shuld pray vnto God all their life long for one crime, yet could
they not make satisfaction for it: but it is onely the bloude of
Christ, that hath made full satisfaction vnto God for all such
crimes. Heb. 7. or els were there none other remedie, but wee
should all perish. There is another satisfaction, which is to my
neighbour whom I haue offended, whom I am bound to pacifie
as we can agrée, and as the Lawe of the Realme determineth
betweene vs, as if I had defamed him, then am I bounde
to pacifie him, and to restore him to his good name againe: If
I haue murthered any man, then by the lawes of the Realme
I must dye for it, to pacifie my neighbour and the Commonwealth:
but yet I am sure that Rastal is not so childish, as to
thinke that this eiuill satisfaction, is the very satisfaction which
pacifieth Gods wrath for breaking his lawe: for if thou murther
a man, and should dye an hundred times for it, yet except
thou haue satisfaction in Christs bloud: and so I speake that
no temporall paine was instituted of God, for the intent that
wée should satisfie Gods wrath thereby, &c.

                        . doe this, and then thou shalt saue
thy selfe and other. ¶Paule maketh no moe Sauiours but
God alone, for he attributeth saluation vnto the instruments
whereby God worketh saluation. When as Dauid killed Golias
                     
with a sling, he that saith Dauids sling killed Golias with a

                        •
                     ling, saith not there was more slayers of Golias beside Dauid,
for the sling was the proper weapon, that Dauid killed Golias
with. And so is Timothy Gods instrument, wherby he wrought
the saluation of Timothy, and of them that beleeued his preaching.
But if a man say that a launce killed Golias, the same man
maketh another killer of Golias beside Dauid, for the Launce
was none of the weapons that Dauid killed Golias with. So
he that giueth saluation instrumentally to any instruments,
which God hath onely appointed, and vsed to worke saluation
vnto other instruments then are peculiar and proper vnto God,
which God neither appointed, neither at any time hath vsed,
neither will allowe for his instruments, maketh another Sauiour
beside God.

of Israel from thee this day. Some expositours doe say, that Samuel
did giue this token to Saule, that such a man shuld raigne
in his steede, as should cut off the lap of his coate, which thing
Dauid did. For Saule, when he saw the lap of his coate in Dauids
hand, said vnto him, Now I know surely, that thou shalt
raigne after me.

               SCEPTER.
               
                  What the Scepter of Christ is.
                  HIs scepter is a scepter of righteousnesse,Heb. 1. 8. not onely a righteous
Scepter, that is, that whatsoeuer he ordeineth it
is righteous, but the scepter of righteousnes, that is, whatsoeuer
is righteous, is ordeined of him: and all spirituall scepters of all
Kings which are not directed by him, they are crooked & broken,
scepters of superstition, and scepters of Idolatry, there is none
of righteousnesse, but only the scepter of Iesus Christ. The
Scepter is a little wande, which Princes haue accustomed to
beare in their hands, and it is a signe of their gouernment, and
by a Metonimia it signifieth héere ye gouernmēt it selfe. Now the
scepter of Christ is as his kingdome is, not a scepter of wood or
mettall like other kings, for his kingdome is not of this worlde
as theirs is: but his scepter the Prophet Esay in plaine words
describeih it:Isa. 11. 4. He shall smite the earth (saith he) with the scepter
of his mouth, & with the breath of his lips, shall kill ye vngodly.
In which words of ye Prophet, we sée both what is the scepter, &
why it hath the name of righteousnes. The scepter is ye word
of his mouth, y• is, the preaching of ye Gospell, not decrées nor decre
                        •
                     alls,
nor traditions of men, nor vnwritten verities: by none
of al these we haue receiued the spirit of God, but onely by hearing
faith preached: it therefore alone is the scepter, &c.

               SCISME.
               
                  What Scisme is, and how it is defined.
                  SCisme is a Gréeke word, lyke as Hersie is, and signifieth
a cutting off, a diuision or a breach; deriued from ye Gréek

word Okizio, which is as much to say as to cut, to deuide, and
to breake asunder. Augustine doth allow their definition, which
doe define Scisme to be a new discention of some Congregation
vpon a diuersitie of opinions: and Heresie, an olde worne
Scisme. But séeing the signification of this word is manifest &
knowen, I thinke it a plainer way to define a Scisme, to bée a
cutting a sunder of the Ecclesiasticall vnitie and peace, whereby
the fellowship of the faithful is deuided into two parts and
opinions, and that it skilleth not whether it be new or olde, or
els from whome it procéede. It was surely a Scisme that the
Corinthians were deuided into two parts, and, said one: I am
of Paule, and another: I am of Cephas, and another: I am of
Apollo. Like as the Scisme of the kingdome of the Israelites
was, when the ten Tribes were separated from Iuda and Beniamin
vnder Roboam, was as well a Scisme when it came to
be olde vnder the last king of that people, as when it was yet
new begun vnder Roboam. So the Schismes of the Church be
as well Scismes after all their auncientie of times and continuance,
as they were at the first beginning, though they conuey
themselues neuer so great a colour of the Catholike church, because
they haue bene so long vsed and accustomed.
Mus. fol. 542.
                  
               
               
                  Of Scismes good and euill.
                  That is an euill schisme, whereby the good vnitie and concord
is cut and put a sunder: and that is a good scisme, when
the naughtie knot and nest was broken. The vnitie of ye Iewes
was naught, before they heard the doctrine of Christ, & concord
was broken by scisme after ye hearing of Christ. So we do read
in Iohn. And ther was a scisme a new among ye Iews, because
of these words & talke. For many of them saide, He hath a Diuell
and is mad, why doe ye hearken vnto him? Other sayde:
These be not the words of one that hath the Diuell: can a diuell
open the eyes of ye blind. This scisme the doctrine of Christ
stirred vp among the Iewes. And what godly person will say,
that the vnitie & concord which went before was better then it.
By the lyke scisme the whole world was d
                        •
                     uided afterwarde,
through the preaching of Christs Gospell, which diuision Christ
doth expresly challenge to himselfe, saieng: I came not to send
peace, but a sword, for I came to seperate, &c. This scisme came
vpon good, that is to say, vpon the Gospell of saluation, and it

tendeth to good ende, that is to saye, vnto the saluation of mankinde:
and it did breake vp the naughtie vnitie, which rested
in the Catholike or vniuersall blindnesse of mens mindes, and
it called all men vnto the true vnitie.

                     cts are Heretikes,Apoc. 9. 3. and specially the Disciples
of Antichrist, & Hipocrites compared to Scorpions. First,
because that lyke as a Scorpion, whereas he is milde to looke
vnto, doth at length strike priuely with venomous sting: for
these men pretend simplicitie before the world, and yet worke
mischiefe by defaming men behinde their backes. Secondly, because
that the Scorpions

                     ngeth with his taile: so these
men preferre temporail gaine, before spirituall graces, & wound
mens consciences deadly, when they promise most to help thē.
And thirdly, because that when a Scorpion stingeth with his
taile, he is not felt at the first, but yet sheweth in his poyson by
little and little afterward. So they that be beguiled with those
Heretikes, féele not the wound at the first, but when the poyson
hath rankeled through all the inward parts, then they feele thē
                     selues
stong in the end. Of these men the Apostle writeth thus:
They that be of that sect,Rom. 16. 18 serue not the Lord Iesus, but their bellies,
and deceiue the hearts of the simple through faire speach &
flatterie.

to builde them vp faire houses and to lyue in wealth and pleasure.
Finally, they venomed their faith with their poysoned
councells and promises, & so tooke they from them y• true hope
in Christ, making merchandise of them, through couetousnes &
faire words. Thus cloystering together lyke Locusts, they haue
left nothing gréene, but they haue withered and destroyed. No
workes might then be vsed of Gods prescription, but such as
were fantasied by them for aduauntage, as Masses founding,
Chauntries building, Priests singing, Images gylting, kissing
of reliques, praieng to dead men and such lyke. And when
they were once franke and full, they stoode vp togethers proudly
against the Lord and his word.

                  Of them which say that Scripture hangeth vpon
the iudgement of the Church.
                  I know (saith Caluine) that they haue commonly the saieng
of Augustine,
                     Contra Epist. fundamentalem cap. 5. where he sayth he would not beléeue the Gospel,
saue that the 
                        •
                     uthoritie of the Church moued him therevnto.
But 
                        •
                     ow vntrue and cauillously it is alleaged for such a meaning,
by the whole tenour of his writing it is easie to perceiue.
He had to doe with the Maniches which desired to be beleeued

without gaine saieng, when they vaunted that they had y• truth
on their side, but proued it not. Now Augustine asketh them
what they would doe, if they did light vpon a man that would
not beleeue the Gospell it selfe, with what manner of perswasion
they wold drawe him to their opinion.Scripture hangeth not on the iudgment of the church Afterward he saith,
I myselfe would not beleeue ye Gospel, &c. saue y• the authoritie
of the church moued me therto: meaning y• he himselfe when hée
was a straunger from ye faith, could none otherwise be brought
to embrace the gospell for the assured truth of God, but by this,
ye he was ouercome by the authoritie of the Church. And what
meruaile is it if a man not yet knowing Christ haue regard to
men. Augustine therfore doth not there teach y• the faith of the
godly is grounded vpon the authoritie of the Church, nor meaneth
that the certeintie of the gospel hangeth theron: but simply
& onely, that there should be no assurednesse of the gospell to ye
Infidels, wherby they might be won to Christ: vnles y• consent
of ye church did driue them vnto it. And the same meaning a little
before he doth plainly confirme in this saieng. When I shal
praise y• which I beléeue,Contra Epist. fundamentalem
                           •
                         cap. 4. & scorne ye which thou beléeuest, what
thinkest thou méet for vs to iudge or do: but ye we forsake such
men as first call vs to come & know certeine truths, after commaunded
vs to beléeue things vncerteine: And that we follow
them that require vs first to beléeue that which we are not yet
able to sée, that being made strong by beléeuing, we may attain
                        •
                     
to vnderstand the thing that we beléeue: not men now, but God
himselfe inwardly, strengthening & giuing light to our minds.

The Church was and is a meane to bring a man more spéedely
to know the scriptures and the word of God, as was the
woman of Samaria a meane that the Samaritanes knew Christ:
but as when they had heard him speake, they sayde. Now we
know that he is Christ, not because of thy words, but because
we our selues haue heard him: So after we came to the hearing
and reading the Scriptures shewed vnto vs and discerned by
the Church, we doe beleeue them and know them as Christs
shéepe, not because the Church sayth they are the Scriptures,
but because they be so, being assured therof by the same spirit
which wrote and spake them.

¶Am I a Sea or a Whale (saith Iob) that thou shouldest set
(as it were) such barres against me,Sea and Whale. and that I should be faine
to haue so great lets to stop me? Iob protesteth héere before
God, that there was no néede why he should be stopped with so
great violence. And why so? I am not lyke a Sea (saith he)
which hath néede of rampires and lets. If a Sea haue broken
ouer his bankes, a thousand or two thousand men must be sent
against it, there must be bringing of timber, of earth, and of
stones, to make vp so great a breach. Also a Whale will not
suffer himselfe to be caught without great adoe, but great force
must be vsed to holde so strong and mightie a beast. But Iob
saith, I am no Sea nor Whale: how is it then that GOD
procéedeth with so great violence against me? Héereby he meaneth,

the kingdome of y• ten tribes, thought in like manner to
preuaile against the kingdome of Iuda: but y• it should so come
to passe, the Prophet denieth & saith: That after the first tribulation,
the second should not follow. This exposition may indéed
be borne withall. But there is an other which is more plaine,
namely, to say that these things are spokē against Sennacherib,
which besieged Hierusalem, vnto whom God threatened a full

                     Fredericus Staphilus, sheweth in his Apology that out
of Luther haue sprung three diuerse heresies or Sects: The Anabaptists,
the Sacramentaries, and the Confessionists, otherwise
called the Protestants. And that the Anabaptists be diuided
into sixe Sects: The Sacramentaries into eight, and the
Confessionists into twentie. Which all be laide to Luthers
charge, and for suffering the rude and rash people, to haue the
Scriptures in their owne tongue.

                  At the first preaching of the Gospell by the Apostles of Christ,
and other holy Fathers, there grew vp immediatly with the
same sundrie sorts of Sects, to y• number of 90. as they are reckoned
in perticular by S. Augustine, all flowing out of one
spring, all confessing one Gospell, and all knowne by the name
of Christ. Besides that the very Apostles and other holy fathers
hath séemed to be diuided by some discention among thēselues.
as Peter frō S. Paule: S. Paule from Barnabas: S. Cipriane frō
                     Cornelius: S. Augustine from Hierome: S. Chrisostome from
Epiphanius: and so forth. Now if Staphilus had ben in the primitiue
church, & séene all these hot and troublesome discentions,
doubtlesse as he saith now all these diuersities sprung from D.
Luther, so would he then haue said, all these former diuersities
and formes of heresies sprang onely from Christ, and so haue
concluded as he doth now, that the rude and rash people should
in no wise be suffered to read the Scripture.

euery good man shall haue good children, which shall inioye and
inherit their Fathers land. For we read in Scripture of many
good Fathers, which haue had children, some foolish & some godly.
Isaac the holy Patriarke had to his sonnes Iacob the vertuous,
and Esau the scapethrift. King Ezechias was a noble and a
godly king of Iuda, whose sonne Manasses was a murtherer
of the Prophets of God, and a cruell shedder of innocent bloud.
Salomon excelled in wisdome, whose son & heire named Roboā
                     
                     
was a rash and a foolish man. And on the other

                     ide Amon
was a wicked Idolater, but Iosias his sonne was a noble,
vertuous and a most excellent king, wherefore we cannot certeinly
conclude, that the words of the Prophet when he sayth:
The soule of that man which feareth the Lorde shall long inioy
good things, and his séede shall inherit the earth, that euery
good man shall haue good children, which shall inioy and inherit
their fathers land, but the meaning is this: By the vertuous
or righteous mans séede, ye must not vnderstand his naturall
séede, but his spirituall séede: his spirituall seede are all those
which doe followe his godly steppes of liuing: All that his séed,
which doe labour to liue a godly lyfe, and study with all reuerence
and feare to please the Lord, all that séede shall long inioy

                  The opening the. 7. Seales, and the meaning thereof.
                  THe opening of the first seale,Apoc. 6. 2. telleth the state of ye Church in
y• time of ye preaching of Christ and of his Apostles. For the

first beast,1. Seale. that is the Lion, gaue his voice, that 
                        •
                     etokeneth the
preachers of Christs resurrection, and of his ascention, for then
yede out a white horse,White horse. and he that sate vpon him had a Bowe
in his hande, and he yede out ouercomming to be ouercome.
                  By this white horse we vnderstand the cleane lyfe and conuersation
that these preachers had, and by the bow their true teaching,
pricking sorrow in mens heartes for ther sinnes without
flattering. And they went out of Iewrie y• they commen off,
ouercomming some of the Iewes, and making them to leaue
the trust that they hadden in the olde law, and to beléeue in Iesus
Christ, and shewen his teaching. And they wenten out
to the Paynims, shewing to them that their Images were no
Gods, but mens workes vnmightie to saue themselues or any
other, drawing them to the beléefe of Iesus Christ, God & man.
In the opening of the second seale,2. Seale. ther cryed the second beast,
that is a calfe,Cal
                           •
                        e that was a beast wonted to bée slaine, and offered
to God in the olde lawe. This sheweth the state of the
Church in the time of Martirs, that for their stedfast preaching
of Gods true lawe, shedde their bloud, that is signified
by the redde horseRed horse that went out at this second opening, &
this estate beganne at Nero the cursed Emperour, and dured
till the time of Constantine the great, that endued the Church.
For in his time many of Christs seruauntes and leaders of
Gods flocke were slaine. For of. 32. Bishoppes of Rome, that
were betwéene Peter and Siluester the first, I reade but of
foure, but that they were Martirs for the lawe of Christ.
                  And also in the time of Dioclesian the Emperour, the persecution
of the Christian men was so great, that in thirtie dayes
were slaine two and twentie thousand men and women, in
diuerse countries for the lawe of God.3. Seale. The opening of the
third seale, telleth the state of the Church in time of Heretikes,
that beth figured by the blacke horse,Blacke horse
                           •
                        
                      for false vnderstanding
of holy writ, for that cried the third beast that is a man,Man.
for at that time was it néede to preach the mysterie of Christs
incarnation and his passion against these Heretikes that 
                        •
                     elden
misse in these pointes: Howe Christ tooke verye mankinde
of our bodye, him béeing God as hée was before, and
his mother béeing maide before and after. The opening of
the fourth seale, telleth the state of the Church in the time

of hypocrites,4. Seale. that beth by signified the pale horse,Pale horse y• beth signes
of penance without forth to binde the people. And he y• sate vpō
the horse, his name was Death,Death. for they should slay Ghostly
them that they leden, and teacheth to trust vppon other thing
then God: And hell followeth him, for hell receiueth thilke that
those destinieth. At that time shal it néede, that the fourth beast
that is the Eagle,Eagle. make his crie that flyeth highest of foules,
to reare vp Gods Gospell, & to praise that lawe aboue other,
least that mens wit and their traditions ouergrow and troden
downe the lawe of God, by enforming of those hypocrits, and
that is the last state that is, either shall be in the Church,
before the comming of the great Antichrist. The opening of
the fift seale5. Seale. telleth the state of the Church that then shall follow,
and the desire that louers of Gods law, shuldeth haue after
the end of this worlde, to be deliuered of this woe. The
opening of the sixt seale,6. Seale. telleth the state of the Church in time
of Antichrists time, the which state ye may know to be in the
Church, when ye séeth fulfilled that Saint Iohn prophesieth
to fall on the opening of this seale, where he saith thus: After
this I sawe foure Angels standing vpon foure corners of the
earth

Lamb. in the b. of Mar. fol. 1266.
                  
                  ¶This is to be noted, that Christ doth not onely commaund
to sell all that we haue, but also to giue vnto the poore: because
to cast away riches without any regard is not a vertue, but
rather vaine ambition. Crates of Thebes is highly commended
of prophane Historiographers, because he cast his money & his
precious Iewells that he had into the Sea, because that hée
thought that without the losse of his riches he could not be safe.
As though indéed it had not ben better to distribute y• to others,
which he counted superfluous vnto himselfe, then so to haue
done. Truly seeing that charitie is the bond of perfection, hée
that depriueth himselfe of the vse of money, deserueth no commendation
at all. Therefore, the selling of the goods, is not
héere commended simplye of our Sauiour Christ, but the
lyberalytie in helping the poore.

the great pride of Sennacherib, and his blasphemy against the
God of Israel, they were sore troubled and moued against him.
The King fled to Niniue, and being in great feare of his lyfe,
gate him into the Temple of his God Nesrah and prayed, promising
his God that if he escaped the great daunger he was in,
of his Lords and Commons, that he would sacrifice both his
sonnes vnto him for a Sacrifice. His sonnes now hearing of
this, fell vpon their father in the Temple and slew him, and so
fled into y• land of Armenia. They did not thus slay their father,
of a desire they had to raigne after him, for then they wold not
haue fled: but they slew him only to saue their own liues. Lyra.

preach Christ truly and purely, without the desire of vaine-glorie

                  How we are commaunded of Christ to
search the Scriptures.
                  Search the Scriptures. ¶The Scriptures are giuen to vs
from aboue, not to the ende we might haue onely in bookes, &
so layed vp as our treasure, as we see many men doe: neither
yet are they giuen that we might simply & slightly read them,
either that by a supersticious opinion, the reading of thē might
be in stéede of worship and diuine se
                        •
                     uice, as we sée the Papists
doe, and as the Iewes continually doe on the Sabboth dayes:
but they are giuen to this ende, that they might be read with
diligence, and with a minde desirous to finde out those things,
which belong to true knowledge and true godlinesse. The readers
of the Scriptures must be searchers, and not corrupters,
wresters, dreamers or supersticious murmurers. And ye scriptures
do not require any searching, but that which is godly, hū
                     ble,
and desirous to know and imbrace one truth onely: otherwise
a man may finde some which read the Scriptures, but not
to search out Gods truth, but rather to hinder the same. Euen
so Herode inquired out the truth out of the Scriptures, concerning
the place where Christ shoulde be borne, not to the ende
he might worship him, but rather to destroy him. Also y• Pharesies
said to Nichodemus, Search the Scriptures, and sée how
that a prophet commeth not out of Galile. They said not, & sée
what is written in the Scriptures concerning Christ. So lykewise

wicked and vngodly men doe search the Scriptures to corrupt
them to their owne destruction. By this word Scripture,
is vnderstood the olde Testament. For Christ did not first of
all begin to be manifest in the Gospell, but hauing testimonie
out of the Lawe and Prophets, he onely exhibited himselfe in
the Gospell. Therefore that which Christ saith heere, agreeth
with that which he spake to his Disciples after his resurrection,
saieng: These are the words which I spake vnto you, when I
was with you, that all must néeds be fulfilled, which was written
of me in the Law of Moses, and in the Prophets, and in the
Psalmes, &c.

without record of the Scriptures. When Paule preached.
Act. 17. 11. the other searched the Scriptures dayly, whether
they were as he iudged them. Why shall not I likewise sée,
whether it be the Scripture that thou alledgest: yea, why shal
not I sée the christure and the circumstannces, and what goeth
before and after, that I may know whether thine interpretation
be the right sense, or whether thou iugglest, and drawest the
Scripture violently, vnto thy carnall and fleshly purpose, or

at that time in Asia, were estéemed to excell almost all the
Churches of the whole world, both in multitude of people, & in
holinesse of life, according as it is to be séene in the Acts of the
Apostles, and in Paules Epistles. Now although that by ye name
of Asia is ment the lesser Asia, which is the third part of this

world, yet not withstanding by these seauen Churches, & by the
seauen Bishops of them, are easily vnderstood al other Churches,
and all Curates of the whole world. According as by the
number of seauen, the Scripture doe commonly betoken a generalitie
or an vniuersalitie. Lyke as in these texts, where the
number of seuen is put indefinitely, or vncertainly: Untill the
barren woman haue borne seauen Children, that is to say, many
children 1. Reg. 2. 5. Also seauen women (that is to say, many

that the righteous falleth seauen times a day, and riseth again.
True it is that some men vnderstand this to be ment of sinning:
but Salomon speaketh onely of the mischaunces we fall into,
for we be beaten with many roddes, one while there commeth
some disease, & another time some other aduersitie. Now some
man shall trouble vs, & anone another shal do vs some wrong.
Ye sée then the falls which godly children fall into. Some stande
of holding them vp with strong hand, it séemeth that he letteth
them tumble downe like little babes that haue no strength.
                  But what? When we be so fallen, God doth alway releeue
vs, and specially (as he saith in another place) he will laye his
hand vnder vs, and will not suffer vs to fall ouer hard.

write of them, and this I thinke to be true, saith S. Hierome.
This is drawen out of the Preface, which S. Hierome made to
the 5. bookes of Moses, wherin S. Hierom doth reproue the 70.
Interpreters of errour, for omitting certaine text of scripture,
which were in the Hebrue veritie, and also alleadged of the Euangelists,
and for adding in their Translation more then was
found in the Hebrue veritie. Also he reproueth those which saith
there is no Hebrue veritie, nor no credite to be giuen to the
Hebrue tongue: but rather to our Latine Bibles. The Preface
is notable, which beginneth on this wise: Desiderij mei,
&c. These words (Respice in me) which be added in our Latine

Psalters, are not found in the Hebrue veritie: for S. Hierom
in the second Apologie y• he wrote answering vnto the rayling
of Ruffinus, finding great fault with Saint Hierome for
his enterprising to translate the olde Testament: saith expresly,
that these words (Respice in me) wer added only by the 70.

filthinesse, and it may be either a feare or els a griefe: for
if a man be afraid, least of that which he doth or which he taketh
in hand, should happen any dishonestie vnto him, hée is
made ashamed: as we see happeneth in young men, which when
they are either demaunded or hidden to do any thing, they blush,
because they are afraide, least they shoulde not aunswere aptly,
or should not be very able to doe that thing which they are
bidden to doe. But if an olde man or a young man be putte in
remembraunce of any thing, which seemeth not to be well done,
they blush because of the sorrow of the dishonestie, whereinto
they sée themselues to haue incurred.

but Christ onely. What meaneth then the Apostles to saye:
God hath ordeyned some in the Church to bée Apostles, some
Euangelists, and some Shepheardes and Teachers?

Also Christ said to Peter,
                     Ioh. 21. 15 Féede my shéepe, for he is the Pastour
which féedeth, and he is the teacher which teacheth. Peter therefore
was a shepheard, although he fed none of his owne, but the
shéepe of Christ. But let vs remember that they which are guided
by the spirit of God, they count that their owne which belongeth
vnto the head, not to vsurpe power vnto themselues, but
faithfully to keepe that which is committed to his charge. For
he which is truly ioyned vnto Christ, will neuer accompt that
to be none of his owne, which hath bene so deare vnto him.

                  If it were necessary (as by the words of S. Hierom) y• they
which would eats the Shewe bread should abstaine from their
wiues, how much more is it necessary, that they that eate the

bodie of Christ dayly as the Priests do, shuld kéepe themselues
chast, and be altogether without wiues? If they eating of the
figure doe require such a cleannesse from women, what shal the
veritie of the thing it selfe doe.
               
               
                  Aunswere.
                  God gaue a commaundement, that when the Paschall lambe
should be eaten, the Israelites should vse no leauened bread by
the space of 7. daies, and that whosoeuer did eate or keepe any in
his house all that while, his soule should perish from among his
people: now may I make mine argument after this manner:
If it was necessarie, that they which did eate the paschall lambe
should abstaine from leauened bread, not onely when they did
eate the Easter Lambe, but also whole sixe dayes after: how
much more is it requisite and necessary, that they which doe
eate the Sacrament of the body and bloud of Christ, which as
ye say was figured, signified and represented, by the Paschall
Lambe, should abstaine from leauened bread. Yea, how dare
your Priests eate anye leauened bread at anye time, sith that
they doe eate and drinke the bodie and bloud of Christ almost
euery day.

                  As often as ye shall eate this bread & drinke of this Cup, ye
shall shew the Lords death, &c. ¶The Lords death is not shewed
except both parts of the Sacrament be ministred, & because
in his death the bloud was diuided from the bodie, it is necessary
that the same diuision be represented in the supper, otherwise
the supper is not a shewing of the Lords death.

words to the ende of the world.
               
            
            
               SHORT LIFE.
               
                  How short life is not a generall rule of Gods indignation.
                  
                     
IT is a certaine token (but no sure token) of Gods indignation,
when a man is snatched away with vnripe death in
his flourishing age. Then what shall we saye to the sentence
written in the Booke of Sapience. 4. chapter:Sap. 4. 11 The iust
man is snatched out of this world, that the mallice of men and
wickednesse of the worlde shoulde not tourne his minde, and
least lyeng should deceiue his soule. And againe, The righteous
man what death soeuer he be preuented withall, his soule shall
go to rest. The Innocents that Herod did murther for Christs
cause, & Iohn Baptist whom he did behead, are the blessed Martirs
of Christ. This must néedes be graunted, y• sometime God
taketh out of this world the righteous onely, because the world
is not worthy to haue them among them, & sometime least the
mallice & lewd example of men shoulde tourne their hearts to
vngodlinesse. But now this taking away of righteous men out
the world, is not a rule nor an order generall that God vseth
with men, but it is onely Per accidens, because that troublesome
times are at hand, as of famine, warres, and such others,
and in such perticular cases. It is true that Christ saide: Beati
sterilis, &c. Happye are the barren and the wombes
that neuer bare, &c. And yet the rule generall of all women is
this: that fruite of their wombe is a blessing, & the contrary a
woman to be barren, is a displeasure, & a plague more grieuous
to them then pouertie or hunger.

                  THis Sicera (as Hierom writeth to Nepotianus) was a kinde
of drinke, much like vnto wine, which was made either of
Wheate, or of Apples, or of Dates, or els of other fruits.

part of a Ba
                           •
                        se. Wherefore a dram was as much in value, as a
shilling of Argentine, that is, thrée halfe Batses, that is foure
shillings. But there were two manner of Sicles, one was

vsuall and prophane, and the other was of the Sanctuary. The
holy sickle was double so much as the prophane. Wherefore
Ezechiel in his. 45. chapter verse. 12. saith, that a prophane sickle
containeth 20. halfe pence, but the sicle of the Sanctuary. 40.

fortie and fiue, saith that the Sanctuary Sicle doth weigh
20. Geras, which the Grecians doe call. Obolus, and we in English
an halfe peny, when 8. grotes of our money was an ounce:
and the Hebrues do think, that Obolus doth weigh the waight

                  What Dauid meaneth by the deuiding of Sichem.
                  
                     SIchem was the most richest and the most strongest Citie in
all the Tribe of Ephraim,
                     Psal. 60. 6 wherof Isboseth was king & ouer
all Israel beside. The Tribe of Iuda onely except, which stucke
vnto Dauid. Now where the Prophet doth prophecie, & make
his bost in God, saieng: Dominus loquutus est è sanctuario suo,
laetabor & diuidam Sichem. The Lord hath spoken it out of his
holy place, I will reioice and diuide Sichem, is no more to say,
but that Dauid should conquere Sichem and be king therof, and
diuide it and lot it as Iosua did, & as all conquerours do when
they conquer any countrey or lande. And as Dauid shoulde
conquere Sichem, so was it saide, that hée shoulde meate

out y• valley of Sucoth, for Dauid reioysing afore hand of Gods
goodnesse towards him, saith: Ego vallem s
                           •
                        coth demetiar. It
is not Isboseth that shall long continue king of sucoth, but it
is I whome the Lord hath appointed to be king of sucoth, and
as I haue now sayd of sichem and sucoth, so will I saye of
Galaad and Manasses: Meus est Galaad, & meus est Manasses:
Galaad is mine and Manasses is mine. And to know what
Sucoth, Galaad, and Manasses were, ye shall vnderstande that
sucoth was a vale nigh vnto the citie of sichem in the land
of Canaan. In the which vale Iacob pitched his tents, after he
had met his brother Esau and was departed from him. And of
his pitching his tents there, the va
                        •
                     le had this name sucoth giuen
him: for Sucoth by interpretation and turning of the word
into Latine, is as much to say as Tabernacula. Galaad was the
name of a little hillocke, as we read in Gen. 31. When Iacob
fled away sodeinly and priuely from Laban his father in lawe,
with his wiues Lea and Rachel. Then at the ende of seauen
daies iourney, Laban ouertooke Iacob in mount Galaad, where
he reproued him, not onely of running away deceitfully, but
also of theft, which when he coulde not proue, Laban cooled
himselfe, and so did shake hands with Iacob. And in witnes
of friendship & of vnfeined reconciliation, Iacob with his owne
hand set vp a stone in title and remembraunce of their true reconcilement,
and commanded his men to fetch so many stones
as made a great heape, which 
                        •
                     ea
                        •
                      is called in Hebrue Galaad:
Tumulum testimonij, vel aceruum testimonij. The heape of
witnesse: Such Galaads hath bene séene in England, which (as
old men say) wer made in token of a man murthered ther. So
that euery such like hillock of stones may be called galaad. But
y• 
                     Galaad wherof the Prophet speaketh when he saith, Meus est
Galaad, Galaad is mine, is called Iabes Galaad, which was the
chiefest citie of al the tribe of Gad: And a people y• shewed great
curtesie in the burieng of king Saule, for the which Dauid commended
them highly. And these Galaadites béeing yet vnder
the dominion of Isboseth, the Prophet sayth, Meus est Galaad,
Galaad is mine. Also by Manasses, ye shall not vnderstand the
king of Iuda, some to Ezechias, neither Manasses the sonne of
Ioseph: but when the Prophet saith: Meus est Manasses, Manasses
is mine, vnderstand ye all the land that lieth beyond Iordane,
                     
which Iosua ga

In my iudgement (saith Caluine) the second opinion
séemeth most allowable, namely that it was some certeine
kinde of tune or song: as if a man would tearme it a Saphicke

               SIGNE.
               
                  What a signe is.
                  THat is called a signe, which besides the forme which it offereth
vnto ye sēses, bringeth some other thing into our knowledge.
And a signe (as Augustine writeth, and the Maister of
the Sentences affirmeth) is diuided into a naturall signe, and
a signe giuen. Smoke is a naturall signe of fire, and clowdes
a naturall signe of raine: but a signe giuen, and appointed of
the will, is diuerse, as letters, wordes, iestures, beckes, and
many such lyke: And these signes may perteine to diuerse and
sundrie senses, but things that are signified, are either thinges
past, things present, or things to come.
Pet. Mar. vpon the Rom. fol. 79.
                  
                  As wel the Gréeke word (Sureion) as the Latine word Signum
                           •
                        
                     
doth sufficiently declare, that those thinges and dooinges
be called signes, which doe signifie some thing. For it cannot
be a signe where there is no signification. Therefore whether
y• the whole things do by sight & vse therof signifie anie thing,
and whether it be added to any thing, as some mark to be for a
knowledge, it is aright called a sign. Augustine defineth a signe

in this wise: A signe is a thing, which besides the matter
that it presenteth to the senses, doth make some other thing
thereby to come into our thought: as when we sée a footestep,
we doe thinke that the beast whose steppe it is, hath passed
there: And when we sée smoake we knowe that there is fire:
And by hearing the voice of a beast, we vnderstand the affectition
of the minde: And at the sound of a trumpet, the souldiers
doe know that they must either march or retire, according to
the matter that the battell requireth, this sayth he.

                  For euen this day we haue receiued visible foode: but the Sacrament
is one thing, and the vertue of th

thing.Augustin

                  Againe, all doctrine is either of things or of the signes of
things: but things are learned by signes.Augustin ¶By this it appeareth,
that Austens iudgement was not, that a signe could
                        •
                      bée
the same thing whereof it is a signe.

                  Whatsoeuer things be such as they are called, by hauing relation
to other things then they be themselues, cannot be those
things wherevnto they haue relation. But ouery thing that is
called a signe, is so by the relation that it hath to the thing
that it signifieth: Ergo no signes can bée the same things that
they doe signifie. And therfore the Sacrament of Christs body
and bloud béeing a signe thereof cannot bee the thing it selfe.

vnto God that his witchcraft might be reuealed vnto the world.

for the assembly of the ecclesiasticall persons are called.

filled with the spirit, speaking to your selues in Psalmes,
hymns, & spiritual songs, singing in your hearts, giuing thanks
alwayes vnto God for all things, in the name of our Lord Iesus
Christ. ¶To Wine
                        •
                      y• Apostle setteth the spirit as contrary,
and forbiddeth the pleasure of the senses, when in stéed of wine
he will haue Christians filled with the spirit, for in Wine (as
he sayth) is wantonnesse, but in the spirit is both a true & perfect
ioy. Dronkards speake more then inough, but yet foolish and
vaine things: Speake ye saith he, but yet spirituall things, and
that not onely in voice, but also in heart, for the voice soundeth
in vaine, where the minde is not affected, they which be filled
with wine, doe speak foolish, filthy, and blasphemous things, but
giue ye thanks to God alwaies (I say) and for all things.
                  Let the word of the Lord abound plenteously in you,Coll. 3. 16 teach &
admonish ye one another, in Psalmes, Hymnes, and spirituall
songs, singing in your hearts with grace. ¶By these wordes
Paule expresseth two thinges, first that our songs be the word
of God, which must abounde plenteously in vs, and they
must not serue onely to giuing of thankes, but also to teach
and admonish. And then it is added with grace, which is
thus to vnderstande, as though he shoulde haue sayde aptlye
and properlye both to the senses and to measures, and
also vnto the voices. Let them not sing rude and rusticall

things, neither let it be immoderatly, as doe the Tauerne hunters.
To the Corinthians, where he intreateth of an holy assembly,
the same Apostle writeth after this manner. When ye

let all things bee done vnto edifieng. By which
wordes is declared that singers of songes and Psalmes, had

fortunae,

to be vsed in the Church at seruice time, because (saith hee)
he would put away all lightnesse and vanitie, which by the reason
of singing doth oftentimes arise in the mindes, both of the
singers and of the hearers.
                  We ought (saith S. Hierome) to sing, to make melodye, and
to praise the Lord rather in minde,Hiero. in 
                           •
                        pist. ad Eph. ca. 5 then in voice. And this it is
that is sayd: Singing and making melodie to the Lord in your
hearts. Let young men, sayth he, heare these things, yea, let thē
heare whose office it is to sing in the Church, that they must
sing to God, not in the voice, but in the hart: neither must their
throate be annointed after the manner of game plaiers with
swéete ointments, that in the church singing more sit for gameplayers
should be heard: but in feare, in worke, in knowledge
of the Scriptures ought they to sing in the Lord. Let the voice
of the singer so sing, that not the voice of him y• singeth, but the
wordes that are read may delight.

in his time,Grego. in regi. part. 5. cap. 44. which when they ought by their office to haue giuē
their mindes to the preaching of the Gospell and the prouision
for the poore, set all their pleasure on pleasaunt singing,
not caring how they liued afore God, so that with their voices
they might please the world. He was therefore compelled to
make a decrée, that all such as be in the holy ministrie should
from thence forth, vnder the paine of excommunication giue
their mindes no more to singing, but applye themselues to the
studies of the holy Scriptures, and the reading of the Gospell.
                  S. Iohn Chrisostome saith on this manner: It is the dutie
of a deuout minde to pray to God,Chri. Ho. 44. de. loā ct Paul. Festo. not with the voice, or with
the sound of the voice, but with the deuotion of the minde, and
with the faith of the heart. Againe he sayth, the crieng of the
voice is not the worke in praier vnto God, whome we knowe
that he beholdeth the secrets of the heart: but the crieng of faith
& the deuotion of a godly & pure minde. Therfore the best way
to pray, is to pray with hart, minde, spirit, soule & inward mā.

What other thing is heard in Monestaries, in Colledges, in
Temples almost generally, then a confused noise of voices,
but in the time of Paule there was no singing, but saieng onely.
Singing was with great difficultie receiued of them of
the latter time: and yet such singing as was none other thing
then a distinct and plaine pronunciation, euen such as wée

common people did then vnderstand, and aunswered, Amen.
Now what other thing doth the common people heare then
voyces signifieng nothing? And such for the most parte is

are heard, onely the sound beateth the eares.

driue & force men to an vnreasonable purity. They binde & lay
on heauie burdens, and cause men to fall vnder them. And often
time we sée them that teach such things to doe contrary to
their owne saiengs. They teach chastitie, and yet kéepe no chastitie.
They doe all things for the commendation of men and
vaineglory, that they may be séene and noted of the people. And
commonly they be such as loue the highest places at feasts and

bankets, and to be saluted and honoured in the market places,
& of the people to be called Rabby, that will be called Bishops
Priests, and Deacons.

better (then such virginitie) héereafter, it were better ther were
no virgins at all. The name (of virginitie) continueth still,
but virginitie it selfe in their bodies is quite gone. They liue
more in pleasure, then harlots in the stewes. Ther is often and
dayly running for midwiues to virgins houses. This manner
of virginitie of women amongest men, is more reproued of all
men, then fornication it selfe.
                  False Prophets, false Apostles, and false Priests sprang vp,
which vnder a counterfait religion deceiued the people,Auentinus in Hildibrando the
most part of them vnder the honest name of chastitie, commit
whooredome, adultery, incest, commonly and without punishment.

without which no man shall sée God: They are giuen ouer into

Againe he saith: absteining from the remedy of marriage, afterward
they flow ouer into all kinde of wickednesse. Againe,
such notorious filthynesse of lecherie there is in manye partes
of the world, not onely in the inferiour Clarkes, but also in

touching the single lyfe of Priests, to be voyde of discreation,
thou séest that many followers of thy counsell willing
vnder a feined colour of continēt life, rather to please man then
God, commit hainous actes: in the end he concludeth thus: by

such discipline of discretion as you know best, roote this Pharesaicall
doctrine out of Gods folde.
                  I beléeue it were a good lawe, and for the wealth and safety
of soules,Pauermitanus extra de cle. coniug. cum olim that such as cannot liue chast, may contract matrimonie.
For we learne by experience, that of the law of continence
or single lyfe, the contrarie effect hath followed: for as much
as now a daies they liue not spiritually nor be cleane & chast,
but with their great sinnes are defiled with vnlawfull copulation,
whereas with their owne wiues they should liue chastly.
Therefore the Church ought to doe as the skilfull Phisition
vseth to doe, who if he sée by experience that his medicine hurteth,
rather then doth good, taketh it cleane away. And would to
God the same waye were taken with all positiue constitutions.
               
            
            
               SINNE.
               
                  The definition of sinne.
                  SAint Augustine
                     Augustin in his 2. booke De consensu Euangelistarum
saith: Sinne is the transgression of the law. Ad simpliciatum
li. 1. Sin is an inordinatenesse or peruersenesse of man, that is,
a turning from the more excellent creator, & a turning to ye inferiour
creatures. De fide contra Manichaeus. cap. 8. he saith:
What is it else to sinne but to erre in the precepts of truth, or
in the truth it selfe. Again Contra Faustū Manicheū li. 22. ca. 27.
Sin is a déed, a word or a wish against ye law of God. The same
Augustine De duobus animabus contra Manichaeus. ca. 11 saith:
Sin is a will to reteine or obteine ye which iustice forbiddeth, &
is not frée to absteine. And in Retract. li. 1. cap. 5. he saith: That
will is a motion of the minde with copulation, either not to
loose or else to obteine some one thing or other. All which definitions
as I do not vtterly reiect (saith Bullinger) so do I wish this
to be considered & thought of with the rest: Sin is the naturall
corruption of mankind, & the action which ariseth of it contrary
to ye law of God, whose wrath, that is both death, & sundry punishments
it bringeth vpon vs.

                  What sinne is.
                  Sin in ye scripture is not called ye outward work only committed
by the body, but all the whole busines, & whatsoeuer acompanieth,

moueth or stirreth vnto the outward déede, and that
whence the works spring, as vnbeleefe, pronenesse & readinesse
vnto the déede in ye ground of the heart, with all his powers,
affections, and appetites, wherwith we can but sin. So that we
say ye a man thē sinneth, when he is carried away headlong into
sinne, altogether as much as he is, of that poison, inclination &
corrupt nature, wherein he was conceiued and borne: for there
is none outward sinne committed, except a man be carried away
altogether, with life, soule, heart, body, lust & minde therevnto.
The Scripture looketh singularly vnto the hart, & vnto ye
race & originall fountaine of all sin, which is vnbeléefe in ye bottome
of the heart:Sinne in Scripture is called vnbeliefe for as faith onely iustifieth and bringeth the
spirit and lust vnto outward good works: euen so vnbeleefe onely
damneth, & kéepeth out the spirit, & prouoketh the flesh, & stirreth
vp lust vnto euil outward works, as it fortuned to Adam
& Eue in Paradise. Ge. 3. For this cause Christ calleth sin, vnbeléefe,
and that notably in the. 16. of Iohn. The spirit (saith hée)
shall rebuke the world of sinne, because they beléeue not in me.
Wherefore then before all good workes, there must néeds hée
fayth in the heart, whence they spring. And before all bad déeds
and bad fruits, there must néedes be vnbeléefe in y• heart, as in
the roote, fountaine, pith, and strength of all sinne, which vnbeléefe
is called the head of the Serpent, and of the olde dragon,
which the womans seede Christ, must tread vnder foote, as it
was promised to Adam.

                  How euery sinne is mortall.
                  That euery sinne is mortall in that it is sinne, is euident
by the words of God himselfe (who can best iudge in this matter.)
In the. 18. of Ezechiel, verse. 4. saieng thus: The soule that
sinneth shall dye, héere is no exception or difference made of
sinne, but any sinne in that it is sinne is deadly: as Saint Paule
sayth. Rom 6. 23. For the reward of sinne is death. Héere also
you see that Saint Paule maketh no difference of sinne, but
that Mors, death, is the reward of sinne generally without exception.
And Saint Iohn sayth: Euerie one that committeth
sinne, the same also committeth iniquitie, and sinne is iniquitie.
Heere also you see that Saint Iohn sayth, (making no difference
of sinne) that sinne in that it is sinne, it is iniquitie,

without exception. Christ sayth, that out of the heart procéedeth
euill thoughts,Mat. 15. 19 murthers, adulteryes, &c. And againe hée
sayth, That whosoeuer beholdeth an other mans wife, to lust
after her,Mat. 5. 28 hath already committed adulterye with her in his
heart. And Saint Iohn following his maister lyke a good scholler,
saith thus:1
                           •
                         Ioh. 3. 15 
                     Omnis qui odit, &c. Whosoeuer hateth his brother
is a murtherer. So it is euident by the sacred Scriptures
that all sinnes without exception are mortall and deadly.

they frée from originall and actuall sinne. And there was found
in them all, either ignoraunce or insufficiencie, in which they
going astray haue sinned, and haue néeded the mercye of God.
By the which béeing taught and instructed haue giuen thanks

by déeds, thoughts, & by words. Lact. in his. 6. b. de ver. cul. ca. 13.

then is it good if it be not possible for it to be without euil? For
that all sinne is euill, who doubteth: we answere both that the
nature of man is good, &c. Sée the place.

                     nder. And also it is much better
to be an humble sinner thē to be a righteous man & arrogant.

Which thing is plainly set forth by the Lord, as the Publican
and Pharesie are brought in for example: as a certeine wise
man saith: Better is in wicked déedes an humble confession,
then in good déedes a proud boasting.

                  How God ordeined sinne, and yet is not
the Authour of sinne.
                  To ordeine a thing & to be the proper cause,God is not ye author of sinne. authour & worker
of a thing is not all one, as by these examples following.
                  He that setteth his wine abroad in the Sunne to make vineger,
ordeined it to be made vineger, and yet he is not the proper
cause of vineger, but the nature of the wine and the hotte
Sunne beames.
                  He that in Spaine cutteth downe grapes in the Summer, &
layeth them in a Sunny place, ordeineth them to be made raisons,
and yet he is not the proper cause of raisons, but the nature
of the grapes, and the heate of the Sunne.
                  Finally to bring a plaine rusticall example, he y• hangeth vp
Swines flesh in a chimney, ordeineth it to be made Bacon, and
yet he is not the proper cause of Ba
                        〈…〉
                     , but the nature of the
flesh and smoake. Wherefore sith it is euident y• it is not euer
all one to ordeine a thing & to be the proper cause & authour of
a thing, we may boldly say the scripture bearing plaine record,
and S. Austen and sundry other most excellent writers holdeth
vp their hands to the same, that God ordeineth sinne, & yet is
not the authour of sinne.

sinneth,Cause of sinne. wherfore the cause of sinne is not to be laied on him.

                     We say that all sinne in that it is sinne is deadly. And yet
we say againe, that there is not any one sin, but that the same
is both deadly and veniall. Deadly if the offender repent not,
veniall, if the same be vnfeinedly repented, and by mercie craued
at the hands of God in the bloud of Christ.Venial sin For the same
God that sayd in Ezechiel, Anima, &c. The soule that sinneth
shall dye, sayth also in the same Chapter: And when the wicked
man turneth away from his wickednesse, that he hath done, &
doth the thing which is equall and right, he shall saue his soule
aliue. Héere you sée like as all sin, in that it is sinne, is deadly:
So againe all sinne in that it is vnfeinedly repented, is also veniall.

                  Whereas sinne is in mans nature, it is not of Gods putting
in by creation, but by reason that Satan did spread his
naughtinesse farther abroad at such time as man was beguiled
by his wilinesse, to disapoint the benefit of God, &c.

Saint Augustin that he was the sacrifice for sinne. For Christ
was without sinne,2. Cor. 5. 21 as S. Paule saith: He hath made him sinne

man, for they regarded and beheld nothing in Iesus Christ, but
manhood, and that the lawe could not release that, which was
pardoned of him, for onely faith iustifieth: and afterwarde the
Lord behelde inwardly their murmuring and said, that it was
easie for the Sonne of man to pardon sinnes in earth, but neuertheles,
none can pardon sinnes but God only: wherfore he that
doth pardon them is God, for none can pardon but God.

                  It is named the sinne of the Holy ghost, not against the godhead
of the Holy ghost: for the same God is also father & sonne:
nor against the person of the Holy ghost, for it is no greater
then the person of the Father and of the Sonne: but it is to
sinne against the graces of the spirite within vs, and so to sinne
against them, that we contemne and despise them, treade them
vnder féete, accompt them prophane
                        •
                      and maliciously cary them
away to all wantonnesse. This then is sinne against the Holy
ghost. In a continuall Apostacie, and general falling from God,

to sinne against thine owne conscience, so that thou despise the
graces of God, which he had giuen thée, to the setting foorth of
his praise, and turne them to the contempt of his maiestie and
glorie. By the example of Satan, and the Angels that fell from

written before, it appeareth that the sinne of the Holy ghost is
a generall Apostacie from God, with wilfull malitious vnrepentaunt
heart, to persecute the truth vnto the ende. As manie
as doe feare at the remembrance of this sinne,The feare they are as farre

                     h
all meanes to resist it, this is sinne against the Holy ghost. As

                      that God
loued Israel and had blessed them,Balaam & promised them great things
and that he would fulfill his promise, yet for couetousnesse and
desire of honour, fell into such mallice against the truth of God,
that he sought how to resist and to cursse the people.
                  Christ saith, It shall neuer be forgiuen héere, nor in y• world
to come: that is, that as the sinne shall be punished with euerlasting
damnation, in the life to come: euen so shal it not escape
vengeaunce heere, as thou séest in Iudas, Pharao, and in Balaam,
and in all other Tyrants, which against their consciences resisted
the open truth of God.
                  The cause why it shall not be forgiuen is, for that the offender
cannot repent, but is vtterly shut out from repentaunce, &
hath his heart hardened: for if he were able to repent, he shuld
be pardoned, because that by repentaunce and faith, all things
are washed away.
               
               
                  Wherefore the Holy ghost will rebuke the world of sinne.

sinne that condemneth the world, by the world,Ioh. 16. 10 vnderstand the
wicked,the world rebuked of sinne reproued and vnfaithfull, and not all the creatures that

to his workes. They that goe backe againe after they knowe
the truth, and giue themselues willingly to sinne, for to follow
it, and persecute the doctrine of truth by profession to maintain
falshood, for their glory and vauntage, are remediles, as ye may

shall be forgiuen,Mat. 12. 31 but the blasphemie against the Holy ghost,
(which Iohn calleth a sinne vnto death) shall neuer be forgiuen,
but is guiltie vnto euerlasting damnation. What sinne or
blasphemie is this? Uerely that declareth S. Marke, saieng:
They said he had an vncleane spirite, that was the sinne vnto
death euerlasting, that was the sinne that should neuer be foruen.
He proueth so euidently vnto them, that his miracles wer
done by the spirit of God, that they could not denie it: and yet
of an hard and obstinate hart, euen knowing the contrary, they
said that he had a Diuell within him. These Pharesies dyed
not forthwith, but lyued peraduenture many yeares after. Notwithstanding
if all the Apostles had praied for these Pharesies
while they were yet liuing, for all that their sinne shoulde not
haue bene forgiuen them. And truth is, that after they dyed in
impatiencie and desperation, which was the fruit of their sin,
but not the sinne it selfe. Now see ye the meaning of this text,
and what the sinne vnto death or against the Holy ghost is. If
any man perceiue his brother to sinne a sinne not vnto death

that is, not against the Holy ghost, let him aske & he shall giue
him life, that is, let him pray vnto God for his brother, and his
sinne shall be forgiuen him. But if he see his brother sinne a
sinne vnto death, that is against the Holy ghost, let him neuer
pray for him, for it booteth not, and so is not the text vnderstood
of prayer after this lyfe (as Master Moore imagineth) but euen
of prayer for our brother which is lyuing with vs.

                      ¶Séeing that this is most true that S.
Paule saith of Christ that he neuer did sinne, neither was there
any guile or deceipt found in his mouth: how then can these
words be verified in the person of Christ: Longe á salute mea,
verba delictorum meorum. The words of my sinnes, or my sinfull
words are 
                        •
                     arre from my health.Our sinne made Christe sinne. Uerely they cannot bée
applyed to Christ for his owne person. Neuerthelesse after the
minde of S. Austen, these words are therefore spoken by Christ
the head, because they be only verefied in Christs members. So
that the Prophet maketh Christ in this place to speake in his
owne person, that thing which is verefied of vs that be sinners,
for whose sake he suffered his death & passion, that in this place
is so lyuely touched. Yea, this is S. Austens saiengs, & these be
his words: Christ did wel say: My sinful words are far from my
health, not for any of his owne sinne: Sed nostra delicta sua delicta
fecit, vt suam iustitiam nostram iustitiam facerit: But hée
hath made our sinnes to be his sinnes, that he might make his
righteousnesse to be our righteousnesse. That is, he is contented
to be reputed and deemed as a sinner, because that in his vniust
suffering, he might iustly saue sinners that beleeue in him. The
most part of the learned Expositours be of this minde.

is taken oftentimes to dye: neither is it so saide of
the good onely, but also of the wicked. It is said of Steuen,

it is written, Of the which some remaine as yet,1. Cor. 15. 6 other some
are asléepe. Also of wicked Ieroboam it is said,3. Reg. 14. 20. And he slept with
his Fathers. Both the wicked and the vngodly sléepe vnto the
Lord and shall be raised of him: but this is onely beleeued of
the godly, which know y• God is not the God of the dead, but of

resolued frō vapors into water. Snow is white, not of ye proper
colour, but by receiuing the light into it, in so many smal parts,
as in fome, or the white of an Egge beaten. Snow is often vppon
high Hills, lyeth long there, because their tops are colde, as
they be neare to the middle region of the ayer. For oftentimes
it rayneth in the valley, when it snoweth on the Hills. Snowe
melting on the high hills, and after frosen againe, becommeth so
hard, that it is a stone, and is called Christall. Sléet is generated
euen as Snow, but of lesse colde, or els beginneth to melte

increase, because the colde driueth heate into the rootes, and so

                  BEcause he is the Sonne of man.Ioh. 5. 27 ¶To be the Sonne of man
according to the phrase of Scripture is nothing els, then to
be a very man, euen as that he is said to be the Sonne of God,
is meant that he is very God. The meaning of Christ is,

that he came foorth vnto men adorned with such power, that hée
might communicate and bestow that vpon them, which he had
receiued of his father. And in that he is man, he was ordeined
by the Father to be the Authour of lyfe, least we shoulde séeke
him a farre off. For Christ hath not receiued any thing, wherof
he himselfe stoode in néede, but rather to make vs rich with
his abundaunt treasure. The summe and meaning is, that in
the man Christ, the same is reueled vnto vs, which was hidden
in God: and the life which men before could not attaine vnto,
is now at hand. Also it is worthy to be noted, y• when he might
haue said, because he is man, he chose rather to saye, because hée
is the Sonne of man. Let this serue our faith against those that
teach, that Christ tooke flesh not of the Uirgin Mary, y• is to say
of the séede of Abraham (which the whole Scripture teacheth)
but that he brought the same with him from Heauen. But
Christ héere plainely, calleth himselfe the Sonne of man, not
man onely.

put vnder him, it is manifest, that he is excepted which did put
all things vnder him: when all things are subdued vnto him,
then shall the sonne also himselfe be subiect vnto him that put
all things vnder him, that God may be all in all. ¶S. Paule in
this place doth the Corinthians to wit, that then shall the ende
come, that all things shall be subdued vnto Iesus Christ: and
Christ his Sonne shall delyuer vnto his Father his kingdome,
that is the Church, the whole number of ye elect, which he hath
by his death redéemed. Then also Christ ye son himselfe shall be
subiect vnto the father, touching the dispensation of his flesh, &
in his members the Saints, by which it is meaned, that then
the mysterie of Christ shall cease, the preaching of the Gospell
shall be left, and no longer any such in the euerlasting kingdom
of God & the saints, shalbe as was in ye militant Church, when
the world was subiect vnto the preaching of the Gospell. For
wher no sin nor disease is, ther néedeth no remission or medicine.
And this subiection of ye Saints, shalbe ye most frée kingdom vnto
them, for then Iesus Christ, very God & man, shalbe al in al:
God in God, & raigning in all things: creature in creatures, & to
God subiect as a creature, &c. Uerely touching the dispensation
of the flesh, and the misterie now in force and vre, Christ shalbe

subiect to his father: but being true God, and cousubstanciall
sonne of God the Father, hath, and shal euerlastingly haue, one
& indiuisible raigne & kingdome with the father.
I. Proctor.
                  
                  ¶Now Christ shall surrender the Kingdome that was giuen
vnto him, that we may cleaue perfectly vnto God, howbeit
he shall not by that meanes vtterly giue vp his kingdom, wherof
as the Scripture teacheth there is no ende, but he shall as it
were conuay it from his manhood to his Godhead. For then
we shall haue an open entrie, and frée accesse to the diuine maiestie,
where now our weaknesse will not suffer vs to approch.
Christ then shall this waye bée subiect to his Father,
for then the vale shall be taken away, and the office of his
mediation shall some way cease, and we shall sée God face to
face raigning in his glory, without any countring or meane.
                  And where S. Paul saith, that God may be all in all, some think
he speaketh so, because we shall haue than without any meane,
many commodities, which God now ministreth vnto vs by creatures.
For maintenance of our lyfe, we shal then haue no néed
of bread and drinke, &c. Neither for edifieng shall we haue any
néede of the Sacraments of the Church, nor the outward word
of the Scripture, nor Ecclesiasticall offices, for God by himself
shall be all in all. Other teach the meaning of those wordes to
be, that the flesh shall couet no more the spirit, but God shal possesse
euery part of vs, and raigne in vs fully & perfectly, which
thing in this life is only begun.

                  The sonnes of God are the sonnes of Seth,
                     Gen. 6. which hadde
instructed and nourished them in the feare of God. The
sonnes of men are the sonnes of Cain, instructed of him to
all wickednesse.

                  The sonnes of God séeing the daughters of men that they
were faire.Gen. 5. 2 S. Austen saith, that those which are ther called
the sonnes of God, were in very déede men, namely, comming

of the stocke of Seth. For when they worshipped God truly &
sincerely, and called vpon him holily and purely being adorned
with his fauour and grace, they are called by the Scriptures,
the sons of God. But when at the length they began to burne
in filthie lusts, with those women which came of the stocke of
Cain, and by that meanes fell into fellowship with the vngodly,
taking them to their wiues, and cleauing also to superstitious
and wicked worshippings, they were chaunged from the
sonnes of God, not onely into men, but also into flesh. And this
will I say by the waye, Aquila translating these wordes out
of Hebrue, They were not (saith he) the sonnes of God, but the
sonnes of Gods: for the cause so called (as I suppose) because
their progenitours were holy men, but their Children miserably
fell from God and godlinesse, by inordinate loue of women.

of God, as in manye places both in the olde Testament
and in the new, the faithfull are called the sonnes of God. And
by the daughters of men are vnderstoode the women that came
of the generation of Cain, which were giuen to all vngodlynesse,
and with them Seth commaunded his children by ye will
of GOD, that they should make no contract of marriage, as
the Lord commaunded the Children of Israel, to make no marriage
with the women of the Cananites.

                        •
                     
to the description of them which beléeue in the name of Christ,
and doe receiue the right of the adoption of the sonnes of God,
they which are such are not borne of flesh & bloud, but of God:
flesh & bloud begetteth not the children of God. That which is
of the flesh is flesh, & that which is of ye spirit is spirit. By these
words the Euangelist meaneth nothing els, but the carnall
birth. For he maketh a comparison of the generation of the
flesh and the spirit, reiecting the one and allowing the other, &c.

They which beléeue in Christ, being before vncleane Gentiles,
are not borne the sonnes of God out of the wombe, or by
flesh and bloud, but are brought therevnto by the workmanship
of the holy Ghost. And although properly he hath respect
vnto the Iewes, which were proud in the flesh, yet notwithstanding
of this place, a generall doctrine maye be gathered,
namely, that whereas we are counted the sonnes of God, it commeth
not by the propertie of our nature, neither of our selues,
but because the Lord hath begotten vs of his owne frée will &
singular loue.

                  But the Lord doth say in an other place, this day will I
fetch againe thy soule from thée. Therefore the soule after it
is once gone from the body, cannot wander heere among vs,
and not without a good cause. For if they that go in a iourney,
if they chaunce to come into some vnknowne country, cannot
tell whither to goe except they haue a guide, how much more
shall the soule being departed from the bodie when she entereth
into life and way, that is altogether new vnto her, bée vncerteine
and ignorant whither she may goe, except shée gette
a guide.
                  It may be proued by many places of Scripture, that y• soules
of the righteous men, doe not wander heere after their death.
For Stephen sayth: Lord receiue my spirit: And Paule did
desire to be loosed, and to be with Christ. The Scripture also
doth say of the Patriarke, and he was layd to his Fathers, being
dead in a good age. And that the soules of sinners cannot
abide there, neither heare the rich what he sayth, marke and
weigh what he doth aske and not obteine. If the soules of men
might be conuersant héere, he would haue come himselfe, as his
desire was, and certified his bretheren of the torments of hell,
By the which place of the scripture this is also most manifest
and plaine, that the soules after they be gone out of their bodyes,
are lead into a certein place, from whence they come not
againe at their owne will and pleasure, but doe tarry there for
the dreadfull day of iudgement.
                  God forbid that we should beléeue that the soule of any Saint,Tertulian in his booke of the soule.
much lesse of a Prophet haue ben fetched vp by the diuel, being
taught that Satan himselfe is transformed into an Angell of
light, much more into a man of light, and that he shall also affirme
himselfe to be God, and worke wonderfull signes for to
subuert euen the very elect if it were possible.
                  But although the vertue of God hath called againe certein
soules into their bodyes, for to teach vs that he might doe it
by his owne right: it shall not therefore be communicated or
graunted vnto the confidence and boldnesse of Magitians or
Sorcerers, and vnto the deceitfulnesse of dreames, and lyeng
Poets: but when in the example of the resurrection, the vertue

or power of God doth bring againe the very soules into the bodies,
it is shewed with a whole & full truth, and which can bée
touched and handled, that is a shape and forme of veritie, or
that is a true and vnfeined shape or forme: so that thou maist
iudge that all fetching vp & appearing of the dead without bodies,
are méere illusions and deceitfulnesse.
                  There be such now a dayes which are wont to say:Theophi. Who
hath seene what is done in hell, who euer came to bring vs
word? But let them heare what Abraham sayth: for if we doe
not beléeue the Scriptures, we wold not beléeue them neither
that should come from hell. The Iewes haue well declared the
same, which because that they beléeued not the Scriptures,
would in no wise beléeue them that were raised againe from
the dead, but wold haue slaine Lazarus that was raised againe.

soundoth out is true: My Father and my Mother hath forsaken
me, but the Lord tooke me vp: if our Fathers haue forsaken
vs, how are they present at our cares & businesse? If our
parents be not present, what other of the departed bée there
which know what we doe, or what we suffer? The Prophet
Esay sayth: Abraham hath bene ignorant of vs, and Israel hath
not knowne vs. God of his great goodnesse promised Iosias that

so that he desireth nothing but to consecrate and dedicate
himself wholy vnto God. The same word also hath ben translated,
perfect, as well by the Gréekes as by the Latines. But
forasmuch as the word perfect hath afterward bene misconstrued:
it is better for vs to vse the word sound, for many ignoraunt
persons not knowing how the sayd perfection is to bée
taken, haue thought thus: Beholde héere a man that is called
perfect, and therefore it followeth that it is possible for vs
to haue perfection in our selues, euen during the time wée
walke in this present lyfe, but they deface the grace of God,
whereof wée haue néede continually. For euen they that haue

liued most vprightly, must haue recourse to Gods mercye, and
except their sinnes be forgiuen them, and that God vpholde
them, they must needes all perish. So then, although that they
which haue vsed this word perfect haue meant well, yet notwithstanding
forasmuch as there hath bene some that haue
wrast it to a contrarye sense (as I haue sayde) let vs kéepe
still this worde Sounde.

(saith he) do boast of the holy spirit: but they which speak their
owne, do falsely pretend that they haue him. As Christ testified
that he spake not of himselfe: because he spake out of ye lawe

who hath more abundaunce of Gods spirit, is more spirituall.
Of a lyke manner S. Paule speaking to the married sorte
in Rome,
                     Rom. 8. 9. as wel as to ye rest, said: Vos non estis in carne, sed in
spiritu, You be not in the flesh but in the spirit: And Saint
Iohn
                     Iohn. 1. 12. in his first Chapter nameth all to be spirituall that beléeue
in Christ, for flesh and bloud is not able to bring foorth
such a child. And if the outward admission were able to make
a man spirituall, then should Iudas and such lyke, who had the
outward election (yet inwardly folowed ye spirit of the flesh & of
the Diuell) be worthely called spirituall. But our Sauiour
Christ reasoning with Nichodemus maketh a plaine proofe by
euident demonstration, that onely such as be endued with
Gods spirit, be worthy of the name spirituall, and that such as
bée not borne of Gods spirit, bée not spirituall but carnall.

And in the same place the Lord hath giuen a generall resolution,
that no man can enter into the kingdome of heauen, vnles
he become a spirituall man and be borne a newe, not onely of
water, but also of the holy Ghost.

The right faith of Christ & the true intēt of works, which God
biddeth vs to worke. He is spirituall and iudgeth all things, &

doth call him spirituall which is renued by the spirit of God,
and béeing gouerned by the same spirit, doth examine and trye
all things with the true touchstone of Gods word, which is set
forth vnto vs by the inspiration of the same spirit that hée is
inclined withall, but he himself (that is to say the spirit) is iudged

                  What certeine of their opinions were.
                  Among other dampnable and false opinions the Stoiks had,
this was one: They did place such power in the Starres, and
in their oppositions, that impossible (they affirmed) it was to
chaunge or auoid that which by their constellation & influence
was appointed to come. Insomuch that they held that Iupiter
himself (whom they called the great and supreame God) could
neither alter nor stop the operation of the starres, and the effects
that should follow therevpon. And so they affirmed that
the mutation of kingdomes, the honours of some, the deiection
of others, and finally that both vice and vertue wer altogether
in the power of the starres. Against this pestilent opinion
straightly and learnedly disputeth S. Austen in diuerse places,
but chiefly in his first booke of that work, intituled, Of the
Citie of God, affirming that onely by the prouidence of God
are kingdomes erected, mainteined and chaunged, that starres
haue no power neither to encline man to vertue nor to vice:
That such blasphemies ought to bée expelled from the eares of
all men.

be driuen to Christ to fetch of his fulnesse, and to take him for
his righteousnesse, and fulfilling of the lawe altogether at the
beginning, and as oft as we fall afterward, and for more then
the thousand part of our fulfilling of the law, and righteousnes
of our best workes all our life long, for except the righteousnes
of Christ be knit to the best déedes we doe, it will be too short to
reach to heauen.

                  Wherefore the Supper was ordeined.
                  THe Supper of the Lord is ordeined, first to confirme vs, and
as it were to seale vs in the same remission of sinnes, the
which we obtaine by faith in the death and passion of Iesus
Christ, and the true and spirituall Communion that we haue
by the same, with all giftes and graces of the same. The second
is, to yéelde thankes vnto him, & to giue testimonie of our faith
towards him, and of our charitie which we haue towards our
bretheren, and of the vnion with the Church. The third, to represent
to vs by the bread and wine, which are ther distributed,
the whole and perfect spiritual nouritour, which we haue by the
meanes of the body, flesh and bloud of Iesus Christ, to the end,
we may be spiritually nourished into eternall life, according to
our benefit which we haue already receiued by our regeneration,
whereof the Baptime is to vs as a Sacrament, in ye which
we haue in the Supper, as it were a gage of our resurrection,
the which we doe beléeue and waite for. There euen as ye bread
and wine be giuen vnto vs visibly and bodely, euen so are ye body
and bloud of Iesus, giuen vnto vs indéede, but inuisible and
spiritually, by the meanes of faith, and by the vertue of the holy
ghost, for he is the meane by which we haue true communion
and true vnion with Iesus Christ, and all his Church, the
which is his body, whereof all true Christians be members.

                  Why the Supper of the Lord was called
a Sacrifice.
                  The Supper of the Lord was not called a sacrifice because
Christ shuld be offered in it, but because he offereth & presenteth
himselfe vnto vs, and that we doe through faith receiue him, and
giue him thankes for the great benefite that we haue receiued,
by the merites of his death and passion & bloud shedding, confessing
and professing, that we holde none other for our Sauiour
but him, and that we doe accept & knowledge none other
sacrifice but his onely, for this cause was the Lordes Supper

called Eucharistia, which word doth signifie thankes giuing.
Thus doth S. Austen and all other Doctors of the Church expound
it.

his body: but he saith that he will ascende vp into Heauen all
whole, saieng: When ye shall sée the Sonne of man ascende
where he was before, at y• least you shall sée then that hée doth
not giue his body in the same manner, as ye thinke & iudge: at
the least you shall then vnderstand, that his grace is not consumed
by morsells, &c.

the Lord hath sworne and will not repent, Thou art a Priest

bread is referred mystically to the body of Christ, and the wine
to his bloud.

shewed, except both parts of the Sacrament be ministred, and
because in his death the bloud was diuided from the body, it is
necessary, that the same diuision be represented in the Supper,
otherwise the Supper is not a shewing of the Lords death.

supper or in supper time. It is very likely, that supper was not
fully ended, that is to say, that the Table was not yet taken away,
séeing it followeth by and by, that the Lord tooke a morsell
of bread and offered the same to Iudas.

                  What Suspention is.
                  SUspention is the censure of the Eldershippe, whereby
one is for a time depriued of the Communion of the Sacraments.
Often this sorte are forbidden, which as yet make
profession of religion. And in olde time among the Iewes the
vncircumcised whether they were straungers or Iewes. Exo.
12. 48. 49. Thus with vs they were by the same reason to bée
debarred for a time, which haue not embraced true religion,
or embracing make no profession thereof. They also are put
backe, which professing religion commit any haynous crime:
for thus in times past the vncleane, although not with greatest
pollution, were put of for a time, as namelye those that were
vncleane by touching of a dead bodye. Num. 8. which after the
same manner ought to bée obserued with vs. Neither it is
doubtfull, but when as Christ hath warned, that he against
whome a brother is offended shoulde not offer his gifte vntill
hée were reconciled, if hée doe it not of his owne frée will,
if the offence be knowne, ought to be by the authoritie of the
Senate, compelled therevnto.

                  Why the Iewes were suffered to sweare
by the name of God.
                  IN the olde lawe, the Iewes (in an earnest, iust & weightie
cause) were permitted to sweare in the name of God,
but not by all manner of creatures, least they dwelling among
the Heathen, and accustoming their othes, shuld by continuance
of time, fall into the filthy worshipping of their Idolls, forgetting
God. Sweare by his name (saith Moses Deut. 6. 13.) and
see that ye walke not after strange Gods of the Nations y• you
remaine among. So that ye neither make mention (saith Iosua
23. 7.) nor yet sweare by the names of their Gods.
               
               
                  Who sweareth aright.
                  They sweare iustly (being required of the Magistrates) which
minding fraud nor deceit, witnesseth onely the truth. Which
séeketh no parcialitie, but the right, not themselues, but ye glory
of God, the profit of their neighbour, and the Common-wealth
of Gods people.
               
               
                  What swearing is lawfull.
                  And sweare by his name,Deut. 10 20. &c. ¶To sweare that which is
true in a cause of faith, either to the honour of God or profit of
thy neighbour is lawfull, and then will Moses that the oth bee
made in ye name of God. By which he meaneth, that if we must
néedes sweare, we referre the oth to God onely, although thou
sweare by a booke, or other thing, as Paul did by his conscience.

                  All priuate swearing is forbidden.
                  Sweare not at all (saith Christ) but let your communication
be yea,Mat. 5. 34 yea, nay, nay. ¶He saith twice yea, and twice nay,
that is yea in heart,Priuate swearing, and yea in mouth, nay in heart and nay in
mouth. And if men when you meane truly, will not beléeue
you by your yea and nay,Basill. let them take héede (saith S. Basil)

                     or
they shall tast the paine that belongeth to the vnbeléeuers, therfore
it is both foolish and damnable, when a man cannot be beléeued
by yea and nay without an oth, because he wold be beleeued
to sweare.Hierom. The Gospell (saith S. Hierom) permitteth no
manner of priuate swearing, because the whole language of a
Christian, should be so faithfull, true and perfect, that euery sentence
thereof shall be able to stand for an oth.

his name in vaine.

he thinketh thee thereby to become a peri
                        •
                     rer, therefore
enforceth he thée to an oth. Seldome hath the priuate oth a good

conclusion. But happely thou wilt say, I cannot

                     ll my wares
vnlesse I doe sweare, or my debter beleeueth me not, vnlesse I
make him an oth. Wherevnto I aunswere, rather be content
to haue thy wares vnsolde, and to loose thy money, then thy saluation
in Christ. Reason faithfully with conscience, and let thy
soule be more deare vnto thee; then thy corruptible substaunce.
For though thou loose part of thy substance, yet maist thou liue,
but if thou loose God, thou canst not liue. A greater reward
shalt thou haue, for loosing of it in the feare of God, then if thou
hadst giuen it in almes, for that is done in paine for the loue of
the Lord, requireth a more worthy crowne, then that is done
without paine. Moreouer I counsell thée as my friend (saith
Chrisostome) if thou be a true Christian, that thou neuer compell
any other man to sweare. For whether he sweareth right
or wrong, thou art not without daunger afore God, considering
that Christ (whose seruaunt thou oughtest to be) hath giuen thee
a sore commaundement to the contrary. Beside that, though
his oth were true, yet is not thy conscience cléere from periury,
for so much as the matter being doubtfull vnto thée, thou puttest
him to the daunger thereof. And if it were false, then hast
thou enforced him to periury, and so for lacke of Christen charitie,
lost both his soule and thine owne, for whom Christ suffered
his death.
                  Worse is he (saith S. Austen) then an homicide,Augustin that compelleth
a man to sweare, whome he knoweth to forsweare himselfe.
For the homicide slayeth but the body, whereas he slayeth
the soule, yea, two soules rather. That is to say, his soule whom
he compelleth to sweare, & his own soule for so compelling him.
                  Christ hath forbidden swearing (saith S. Gregory) that wée
should the more easely auoide all manner of occasion to periury,S. Greg. in ho quadā
                     
he that feareth God without an oth confesseth the veritie, he
that feareth him not, will not with an oth confesse him.
                  Take heed (saith Chrisostome
                     Chrisostō
                     ) you that be reckened for spirituall
men, very swift are ye to offer the sacred Gospell vnto

                        〈…〉
                      that sweare, whereas ye ought to teach the contrary.
                  If a man may not (saith Origen) in euery light matter sweare,Origen.
no more maye they that haue authoritie for euery light matter
compell a man to sweare. How can you be cleane from periutie
that ministreth the occasion? May he that beareth fire to the

burning of an house, be frée from the burning of it? Or he from
the slaughter of a man, that bringeth the weapon wherewith
he is slaine? Nay surely
                        •
                      But he that giueth occasion to periury,
must needes be a partner or the same. Withdraw the fire & ther
shalbe no burning, conueigh away the sword, & there shalbe no
murther committed: sequester swering, & ther shalbe no periury.
                  Oft swearing (saith Isidore
                     Isidore) bringeth man to an vseé & that
vse leadeth to a custome, which bringeth in periurie. No néede

                  As to hate in thine hart,Swearing corrupted or to couet another mans wife was
no sin with y• pharisies, no more was it to hide one thing in his
hart, & to speak another wt his mouth, to deceiue a mans neighbor,

to bind vnder pain of sin. And so by y• meanes not only they that

                  Of the concealing of swearing.
                  If a soule sinne,Leui. 5. 1. & heare the voice of swearing, & is a witnes

whether he hath seene or knowen it, if he doe not vtter it, he
shall beare his sinne. ¶This is diuersly expounded, because the
Hebrue word hath a double significatiō, this is ye sense as some
thinketh: If a Iudge do minister an oth to any priuate man to
declare ye truth of any thing y• he hath seene & do it not, he sinneth
Other this. If any man sée his neighbour commit any sin
which is by the law of God execrable or detestable, and did conceale
it, and not open it as much as in him did lye, he did sinne.
Some other take it thus: All such as did heare any man curse,
banne and abuse the name of God, and did not open it vnto the
Magistrate, did sinne: the first sense is best lyked.

                  WE will perchance say, that the Sunne is hot: yea, but how
is the sweate ingendered? It is because the body is then
loosened, & the same loosening doe so open the body, that ye maysture
cannot tarry within. Againe, when it is cold weather, the
poores are shut vp, & the moisture shrinketh inward, to nourish
a mans lyfe, whereas ye contrary is done by heate. Again ye heat
ingendereth féeblenes, and that feeblenes maketh humours to
melt. And so ye see the cause of sweating.

which for all they haue receiued the pure gospell of Christ,

will yet continue still in sinne, and roll themselues in the puddle

ignoraunt and also the weake, vse the vttermost of their lybertie,
interpreting it after the largest fashion, and most fauour of
the flesh, as it were the Popes pardon, and therewith make the
truth euill spoken off, that thousands which els might haue ben
easely won, will now not once heare thereof, and stirre vp cruell
persecution, which els would be much easier, yea, and sometime
none at all. And yet will those Swine, when it commeth
to the point, abide no persecution at all, but offer themselues
willingly euen at the first chop to denie, or they be scarcely apposed
of their doctrine. Therefore lay foorth the law of God before
them, & cal them to repentance, & if thou see no hope of mending
in them, cease there, & go no farther, for they be swine.

was this Temple a building, and wilt thou build it in thrée
dayes. Héere we see how the Temple was a building fortye
yeares, not meaning that they were continually working on
the same so long (for sometimes it was forbidden and stopped
by the kings that ruled after Cyrus) but that there were so
many yeares from the beginning of that worke, vnto the finishing
of the same. For in the second yeare of king Cyrus they
layde the foundation, and in the second yeare of Darius (the
sonne of Assuerus and Ester) they were willed by Aggeus the
Prophet, to take in hand their worke againe, which they finished
in the sixt yeare of the same Darius. So that from ye second
yeare of Cyrus vnto the. 6. yeare of Darius, were. 46. yeares,

as God, and to bée extolled aboue all that is named God. It is
written:1. Cor. 3. 17 The Temple of the Lorde is holy, which is you.
Therfore the conscience of man is the temple of the holy Ghost,
in which Temple I will proue the Pope to sit as God, and to
be exalted aboue all that is called God. For who so contemneth
the Decalogue, or the Table of the ten commandements
of God, there is but a smal punishment for him, neither is that
punishment to death: but contrariwise he that shall contemne
or violate (speaking to Frier Brusiard) the constitutions which
you call the sanctions of men, is counted by all mens iudgements
guiltie of death, what is this but the Bishop of Rome,
to sit and to reigne in the Temple of God, that is, in mans
conscience as God.

               TEMPTATION.
               
                  What Temptation is.
                  TEmptation is nothing else, but to take proofe or triall of
any thing, wherefore the end of temptation is rightly called
knowledge: And they which will passe ouer a water, doe
trie out the shallowe places to know the depth of the water:
wounds also are tried of Surgions, to féele the déepenesse of
them: In tempting therefore, knowledge is sought. But God
néedeth not that new and fresh knowledge, for such is his nature
that he knoweth all things most perfectly. But when he
tempteth, he onely doth it to leade men to the knowledge of
those things which they ought to knowe. Wherefore when he

sometime tempteth good and holymen, hée bringeth into lyght
and maketh open the fayth, obedience
                        •
                      strength, and godlynesse,
which before laye hidde in their heartes, that they
which sée the same things, might glorifie God the authour of
them. And that they which are so tempted, when they haue
gotten the victorye, may giue thankes and desire of him, that
euen as he hath done now, so he woulde vouchsafe to helpe
them continually in temptations.

                  How temptation generally is
not euill.
                  All temptations or tryall is not euill: For God tempted
his seruauntes: One friende is tempted of an other:
The childe is tried by the Father: the wife by her husband:
the seruaunt by his Maister, not that they might bée hurt
by tryall, but rather that they might thereby bée profited.
The Diuell also tempteth, wherevpon also hee is called
a temptor in the Scripture. Also enimies vse to tempt, not
to profite thereby, but to hurt and destroye. This kinde of
temptation is wicked. Therefore the Lorde hath exhorted
vs to beware of those which tempt with an euill minde,Mat. 10. 16
when hée willeth vs not onely to bee innocent as Doues, but
also wise as Serpents.

let vs be circumspect and warie, for Satan wil come vpon vs

                  It is certeine (faith Ambrose) that the first commaundement
is conteined in this: Thou shall haue none other Gods but me.
The second: Thou shalt not make thy selfe anie lykenesse of

any thing that is in heauen, &c. The third: Thou shalt not take
the name of thy Lord God in vaine: The fourth: Thou shalt
obserue my sabboth daies. The fift: Honour thy father, &c. But
bicause these first foure precepts perteineth vnto god, they must
be vnderstood to be conteined in the first table. The rest perteineth
to men, as to honour thy parents, not to kill, not to cōmit
fornication, not to steale, to beare no false witnesse, to couet nothing
of thy neighbours. These sixe commaundements séemeth
to be written in the second table, whereof the first is: Honour
thy Father, &c. Thus much Ambrose.

some do thinke, that euen as from milke is separated whaye,
so also a watrish humour is separated from bloud, wherof the
greater part turneth into vrine, & y• which remaineth is thrust
forth into teares. Lastly Seneca in his. 100. Epistle to Lucillus,

                     Iudic. 17. 5 ¶Touching the signification of
this word (Theraphim) there is great ambiguitie among
the expositours. But I vnderstand it to be that Idoll which
they had grauen and molten, when all the other thinges were
ready which serued for Idolatry, they at the length brought
that Image vnto the Temple. And of these Theraphims or
Images, they were wont in the olde time to aske Oracles. In
Genesis we read that Rachel the wife of Iacob, stale awaye the
Theraphim of her Father. And in the first of Samuel, the. 19.
chapter, when Dauid escaped, Michol put in his bed Theraphim.

spoken,Mat. 26. 26 but that the sense is not so plaine, it is manifest to
euery man that wayeth substancially the circumstances of the
place. For when Christ gaue bread to his Disciples and sayd:
This is body, ther is no man of any discretion, that vnderstandeth
the English tongue, that he may well knowe by the order
of the speach, that Christ spake those words of the bread, calling
it his body: As all the olde authors also do affirme, although
some of the Papists denie the same. Wherefore this sentence
cannot meane as the words séeme and purport, but there must
néeds be some figure or mysterie in the speach, more then appeareth
in y• plaine words. For by this manner of speach plainly
vnderstoode without any figure as the words do lye, can bée
gathered none other sense, but that bread is Christs body, and
that Christs body is bread, which all christian eares do abhor
to heare. Wherefore in these words must néeds be sought out
an other sense and meaning, than the words of themselues do
beare. ¶Looke. Bread, how it is called Christs body. Cranmer:

so calling the bread his body, which is a signe & Sacramēt

                  What the cause is that maketh thunder.
                  THunder is a sound, caused in the cloudes, by ye breaking out
of a hot and drie exhalation, boating against the edge of the
cloude. It is heard in Spring & Summer, by reason of the heate
of the Sunne, that then draweth vp many exhalations, which
méeting in the middle region of the ayre, with colde and moyst
vapors, are together with them inclosed in a hollow cloud. But
when the hot exhalation cannot agrée with the coldnesse of the
place, by this

great Authors of moist wood, y• cracketh in the fire, we may adde
héerevnto the breaking of an Egge in the fire, of an Apple or any
like thing, for what soeuer holdeth & withholdeth inclosed any
hot winde, so that it cannot haue no vent, it wil séeke it selfe
a way by breaking the skin, shell, or case. It were no euil comparison
to liken Thunder to the sound of a Gun

& in the new there is o

                     ten mention made of thundring, which
God miraculously sent down frō heuen aboue. In the 9. of Exo.
ve. 23. God plagued K. Pha

                        o because he wold not let ye childrē
of Israel depart out of Aegipt, wt thūder, lightning & hail stones.

In the 1. Reg. 7.1. Re. 7. 10 When y• 
                     Philistines made warre against y• 
                     Israelites,
thinking to haue destroyed them all, the Lord with a
sodaine great Thunder cracke, did make the Philistines so sore
afraid, that they ranne away and were slaine the most parte of
them.Ioh. 12. 29 Also in the new Testament. Iohn. 12. Christ a lyttle before
he should suffer his Passion, praied vnto his Father saieng:
Father, delyuer me from this houre, but therefore came I into
this houre, O Father glorifie, and set out thy name, thy might,
and power. And immediately, there came a voyce from heauen
saieng on this wise: Glorifica
                           •
                        i, & iterum glorificabo. I haue
glorified it, and I will glorifie it. As he might say: I haue glorified
it in thée my sonne, since the first houre of thine Incarnation,
with manifest & wonderfull great miracles, Et iterum glorificabo,
and I will glorifie my name in thée, after the time of
thy glorious Resurrection, and Ascention, more then euer I
haue done, through the comfort of the Holy ghost, which shall so
worke in the hearts of men, that then shall my name in thée my
sonne Christ, begin to flourish in such wise, as it neuer did before.
When this voice was heard, there was such a stout noyse
heard from heauen, that the people that followed Christ Dixerunt:
Tonitrium factum esse. They said it was a Thunder.
Such a Thunder was heard vpon the daye of Pentecost, at the
comming downe of the Holy ghost. Now héere is to be noted,
that the Thundering of God mentioned in the old Testament,
were euer to fraye and to make men agast: but the Thundering
of God mentioned in the new Testament, were so tempered
that they did not feare, but comfort men, wherein is manifestly
declared a Maiestie, to be both in the Law & in the Gospell
: but yet the one to driue vs to God for feare of the rodde,
and the other with the loue of euerlasting reward to imbrace
Christ. Of whom the words of the Prophet Dauid. Psal. 18. bée
verefied, as well in y• letter, as in the Allegory, when he saith:
Intonuit de coelo Dominus, & altissimus dedit vocem suam:
                     Psa. 18. 13
The Lord from heauen hath thundered, and the highest hath
declared his voice.
Ric. Turnar.
                  
                  The Lord also thundered out of heauen, &c.Psa. 18. 13 ¶By all the
things héere rehearsed, is described the power, might & maiestie
of almightie God which he declareth in tempests, of which the
whole 29. Psal. intreateth. And in Iob. 37. are lyke things mentioned

to y• setting out of his power. Oftentimes we read, that
when he would more openly & more expresly declare his power
vnto men, caused thunder, lightening and earthquakes, &c. As
in Exo. 19. 16. when the law was giuen. 1. Reg. 12. 18. when the
people desired a king. Mat. 27. 51. when Christ was on y• Crosse.
Act. 2. when the Holy ghost came vpon the Apostles. Act. 4. 3
                           •
                        .
when they prayed. With such lyke words doe some suppose,
that God did at one time or other shew his benefite to Dauid,
and confirmed his promises with shaking y• earth, sending thunder,
lyghtening, hayle, cloudes, stormes, & other terrible tokens,
wherwith he holy Dauid & ouerthrew his enimies. Neither letteth
it y• the Scripture mentioneth not thereof in any place, for
it mentioneth not the Tempest which Esay prophecied to come
in the deliueraunce of Hierusalem from the Assyrians, yet who
will denie but that it was in very déede so done.

                  MY time is not yet come. ¶Some interpret this of the time
of Christs death, but not aptly:Iohn. 7. 
                           〈…〉
                        . for he speaketh of y• time
of his departure, & affirmeth that he differeth from his kinsmen
in this, y• they might without danger, come foorth at all houres
in the face of y• world, because they haue y• world their friends.
But he had good cause to feare, for that the world was his enimie.
And he giueth them to vnderstand, that they giue euil aduice
in a knowen thing. As if he should say, my time to goe thether
is not yet come, when time shall serue, I shall neede none
of your admonitions, I know what and when to do euery thing:
how also & when I must be knowen vnto the world, doth not
depend on mans coūsell, but on my fathers decrée, &c. Euery man
ought to consider his time, and not to doe anie thing out of due
time, but patientlye to tarrie the opportunitie of a conuenient
time. The Lorde woulde not goe with his bretheren
to Hierusalem, because his time was not yet come.
                  At another time he commaunded Passeouer to be prepared at
Hierusalem, saieng I wil kéepe y• Passeouer, at thy house with
my disciples. And to his mother he said: Mine houre is not yet
come. Let euery one of vs therefore, learne by this example,
to frame our selues according to the conuenientnesse of the
time, euen as the Astpole Paule teacheth vs, but so notwithstanding

                  Why Mary was forbidden to touch Christ.
                  Touch me not.Ioh. 20. 17 ¶This séemeth not to agrée with the narration
of Mathew. For he plainly writeth, that the women imbraced
the féete of Christ. And séeing afterward, he woulde haue
his disciples to handle and to féele him, what cause was there,
why he shuld forbid Mary to touch him. For he said vnto Thomas,
bring hether thy finger and sée my handes, and put thy finger
vnto my side, and be not faithlesse, but beléeuing. The solution
thereof is very easie, if so be that we consider that the women
were not prohibited y• touching of Christ, before such time
as they wer too busie and desirous to touch him. For no doubt

he did not forbid them to touch him, so farre foorth as it was
néedfull to take away all doubt. But when he saw they were
too busie in imbracing his féete, he moderated and corrected that
rash zeale, for they depended vpon his corporall presence, neither
did they knowe any other waye to inioye him, then if he
dwelt among them vpon the earth. Moreouer, because his disciples
doubted whether he was truly risen againe or no, and because
the same that appeared to them was iudged of them to
be but a vision, to the ende they might beléeue the resurrection,
he said, féele and sée, for a spirit hath no flesh and bones as ye sée
me haue. Also Thomas had said, except I sée y• print of his nailes
in his hands, and put my fingers into the print of the nailes, &
my hand into his side, I will not beléeue, therefore Christ did
very well in offering himselfe to be felt of him. But in Mary
there was no such doubting, that there should néede any farther
féeling: but it was requisite y• she shuld come to a further faith,
and to more plaine vnderstanding of the kingdome of Christ,
least she should abase him in computation, more then ther was
cause.

                  The Pharisies said not vnto Christ:Chrisostō
                      Wherefore doe thy
disciples breake the law of Moses, but wherefore do they break
the traditions of the Elders. Whereby it appeareth, that they
had altered many things, whereas God had commaunded that
they should neither adde nor diminish: but fearing least they
should loose their authoritie, as if they had bene law makers to
the ende they might seeme the greater, they altered much,
which thing grewe to such a wickednesse, that they kept their
owne traditions, more then the Commaundements of God.

commaund, although they be vngodly, and for their authorities

rightly the lawe of Moses, & not of such as did snare men with

                  A reason that ouerthroweth all doctrines of
men, all Traditions, all Poperie.
                  God said to Christ,Mat. 17. 5 Thou art my sonne, therefore he is his
sonne. God said not so to any Angell: therefore no Angell can
take the name vnto him.
                  God said,Iohn. 3. 21 The true worshippers shuld not go to Mount Sion
nor to Hierusalem, but worship God in spirit & truth: where
said he, goe a pilgrimage, or go visit this holy sepulcher.
                  God said:Gal. 4. 10. Do not obserue dayes, and months, & times, and
yeares: where said he: Kéepe vnto me Lent or Aduent, Imber
dayes or Saints eues.
                  God said to vs,1. Tim. 4. 2 It is the doctrine of Diuells to forbid marriage,
or to commaund to abstaine from meates, where said he:
Eate now no flesh, now no whit meate: let not the Ministers
marrie?
                  God said,Rom. 13. 1 Let euery soule be subiect to Kings & Princes, and
the authoritie of such men,Luk. 22. 26 let it not be in his Apostles. Where
said he: let the Pope haue the gift of kingdoms, be exempt from
authoritie of man, weare a triple crowne, and haue Lords and
Noble men vnder him?
                  God said,Apo. 22. 18 Cursed is he that addeth ought to the lawe, or taketh
from it. Where said he, The Pope shall dispence against
mine Apostles and Prophets?
                  God said,1. Co. 14. 19 It is better to speak fiue words which we vnderstand,
then ten thousand words in an vnknowen tongue: where
said he the ignoraunt men should pray in Latine? With this
very argument are ouerthrowen, all doctrines of men, all traditions,
all Popery, &c.

                  What an obstinacie is this,Cipriane. or what a presumption, to presume
an humane tradition before Gods ordinaunce: nor to consider
that God taketh indignation and wrath, so often as an humane

tradition looseth, or goeth beyond the commaundement of
God, as he cryeth by his Prophet Esay and saith: This people
honoureth me with their lips, but their harts is seperated from
me, they worship me in vaine, while they teach the commaundements
& doctrines of men. The Lord also in y• Gospell blaming
likewise & reprouing, putteth forth and saith: ye haue reiected
Gods commaundement to stablish your tradition. Of which cō
                     maundement
S. Paule being mindfull, doth likewise warne &
instruct, saieng: If any teach otherwise, and contenteth not himselfe
with the words of our Lord Iesus Christ & his doctrine, he
is puft vp with blockishnes, hauing skill of nothing, from such
a one we ought to depart.
                  S. Austen saith: that the auncient actes of the godly Kings,Augustin
mentioned in the Propheticall bookes, were figures of the like
facts, to be done by the godly Princes, in the time of the newe
Testament.

                  LOng after Boniface the third, when Idolatry had gotten the
vpper hand, then did Petrus Lombardus (a master of sophisticall
sentences) bring vp these termes of Transmutation, and
Transaccidentation (about the yere of our Lord. 1646.) out of
certain blinde trades of the Doctors afore his time. Then Pope
Innocent the third gaue it this new name, & called it Accidens
sine subiecta. Of the which Sophisme Doctor Dunce, Doctor
Dorbel, and Doctor Thomas de Aquino, doe dispute very subtilly.

               TRANSVESTANTIATION.
               
                  What the word signifieth.
                  THe word signifieth a passing or turning of one substance into
another, which is thought of some not tollerable to saye,
that the substance of bread in the Sacrament is chaunged into
the substance of Christs body. And therefore Dunce
                     Dunce, himselfe vtterly
refuseth & shunneth it. And thinketh it better to hold that
the bread departeth & getteth it selfe away, & that then in place

of it succéedeth Christs body.
               
               
                  When it was first inuented.
                  That which is former (saith Tertulian) is true, that which is
latter is false. But the doctrine of Transubstantiation is a late
doctrine: for it was not defined generally afore the Councell of
Laterane, about 1215. yeres after Christs comming, vnder Pope
Innocentius, ye third of that name, for before y• time it was frée
for all men to beléeue it or not beléeue it,Tonstall Bishop of Duresine as y• B. of Duresme
doth witnes in his booke of the presence of Christ in his supper
lately put forth, Ergo y• doctrine of transubstātiatiō is false.

                  Reasons against Transubstantiation.
                  That the Lord gaue to his disciples bread & wine & called
it his body,1. Reason the very scripture do witnes. For he gaue that & called
that his body which he tooke in his hands, whereon hée gaue
thanks, which also he brake & gaue to his disciples, y• is to saye
bread, as y• fathers Ireneus, Tertulian, Origen, Cypriane, Epiphanius
& Augustin, & all the residue which are of antiquitie do
affirme: but inasmuch as the substaunce of bread & wine is an
other thing then the substance of the body and bloud of Christ,
it plainly appeareth that there is no Transubstantiation.
                  The bread is no more transubstantiate then y• wine:2. Reason but that
the wine is not transubstantiate, S. Mathew and S. Marke doe
teach vs: for they do witnes, y• Christ said, that he would drinke
no more of the fruite of y• vine, which was not bloud, but wine:
and therefore it doth follow, that there is no Transubstantiation.
Chrisostome vpon Mathew, and S. Cypriane doe affirme
this reason.
                  As y• Bread of the Lords supper is Christs natural body,3. Reason so
is it his mysticall body, for the same spirit that spake of it: This
is my body, did say also: for we being many, are one bread, one
body, &c. But now it is not his mysticall body by transubstantiation,
& therfore it is not his natural body by trāsubstātiation.
                  The words spoken ouer the bread in S. Luke & Paule,
                     4. Reason are
not so mightie and effectuall as to transubstantiate it. For then
it or that which is in it, shuld be transubstantiate into the new
Testament: therfore the words spoken ouer the bread, are not
so mightie to make Transubstantiation.

confirmed, his kingdome began to arise, and increased aboue all
other Regions, and brought foorth weapons against the West
part of the world, to punish the filthie spottes of the Romane
Church So that as soone as this Idolatry of the Masse began
to be confirmed of the people, the Turkes power did increase to
scourge it in Christ. And shall yet more and more grow & prease
vpon vs, till this Idolatry of the Masse be taken quite away, &c.
               
               
                  The cause wherefore the opinion of Transubstantiation
is holden and defended.
                  The words of scripture (saith Iohannes Scotus, otherwise called
Dunce
                     Dunce) might be expounded more easely and more plainly
without Transubstantiation, but y• Church did chuse this sense
(which is more hard): being moued therevnto (as it seemeth)
chiefely because that of the Sacraments men ought to holde as
the holy Church of Rome holdeth: but it holdeth that bread is
transubstantiate or turned into the body, & wine into the blood,
as is shewed De summa trinitate & side catholica

                     Gabriel (who of all other wrote most largly vpon y• Canon
of the Masse) saith thus: It is to be noted, that although in the
scripture, that the body of Christ is truly contained & receiued
of Christian people, vnder the kindes of bread & wine, yet how
the body of Christ is there whether by conuersion of any thing
into it, or without conuersion, the body is there with the bread,
both the substance & accidents of bread remaining there still, it
is not found expressed in the Bible. Yet forasmuch as of the sacraments
men must hold as the holy church of Rome holdeth, as
it is written De hereticos, ad abolendū, & that Church holdeth &
hath determined that the bread is transubstantiated into the
body of Christ, & the wine into his bloud, therfore is their opinion
receiued of all that be Catholike, that the substance of bread
remaineth not, but really & truly is turned transubstantiate and
changed into the substaunce of the body of Christ.

in worldly goods (as they call them) and therefore must y• hurt
be restored, and the fift part thereto. If the partie remained not
to whome the restitution was due, nor anye of his lawfull

had no other liuelode.

of such things as are laid vpon them outwardly, as of

This is the outward persecution, wherewith Tyrants & other

                     In tempore ergo Christi, &c. In the time therfore
of Christ, when they were commaunded to giue tribute to
the Romanes, there was a thought & counsell among y• Iewes,
V
                           •
                        rum deberent, whether they ought that were Gods people,
and his portion, to giue Princes tribute, or rather take armes
for their libertie, except they wer suffered to liue as they lusted.
And the storie telleth that one Iudas a Galilean, of whom Luke
mentioneth in the Acts of the Apostles, drawing away the multitude
of the Iewes, taught Non oportet, they ought not to giue
tribute to Caesar, and call Caesar Lord But he that was at that
time the Tetrach hastened to perswade the people, and that they
should regard the present state, and not wilfully take armes against
the stronger, but be content to giue tribute. And truly the
word of this present gospel, not indéed manifesteth, yet it sheweth
these things. But he y• diligently considereth the sense of the
present words, shall finde this, yea, euen in this place. For the
Pharisies had not had occasion (being willing to take Christ
in speach, sending their disciples with the Herodians) to aske
him whether it were lawfull to giue Caesar tribute or no, if it
had bene manifested among them, that they ought not to giue it,
and that there had bene agréement of all their wills, that they
should not giue it.

the condition of the question propounded, he would violate the
worldly power: An videtur reddi tributum Caesari oportet,

                      whē they

because he is a christian, he ought not to render taxe or tribute,
or that honour ought not to bée giuen due to those powers
that care for these things, he falleth in great errour, but that
meane ought to be kept which God himselfe prescribeth, that
we should giue vnto Caesar the things that are Caesars, and to
God the things that were of God.

therevpon they might take him as a seditious man, & mouing
the people against Caesar, and therefore they bring the Herodians
with them that were the kings men, to apprehende him
as a stirrer of new things Thou regardest not say they, the
person of any man, thou speakest nothing to get the fauour of
Herode and Pilate. Tell vs therefore, Debemus & hominibus,
ought we to be both tributary to men, and to giue them
taxe, as well as to giue taxe to God, or shall we giue to God
onely, or else to Caesar? This they spake (as I said) that he shuld
say, that tribute ought not to be giuen to Caesar. Thus we sée

againe their question whether they ought or no. But Iesus
by the coine that was figured in the Image of Caesar, Persuadit
illis debere Caesari, perswadeth them that those things are
owing to Caesar that are his, that is, those that haue his Image
both in corporall and outward things, we must obey the king,
but in inward things & spirituall, onely God.

and say, if a man haue an hundred (as he may haue as well
as two) yet all is but two, and one flesh in the Lorde.
Christ doth not so interpret two. Math. 19. but referreth two to
one man and one woman, as the text that he alleadgeth out of
Genesis. chapter. 1. and 2. declareth, saieng: Haue ye not read
that he that made man from the beginning, made the male &
female, therfore shal man leaue Father and mother and associate
his wife, and shall be two in one flesh. This text admitteth
not pluralitie of wiues, but destroyeth plaine the sentence
of those that defend the coniunction of many wiues with one
man. For at the beginning of Matrimony was but one man
and one woman created and married together, no more shuld
there be now in one matrimonie, as Christ there teacheth and
expoundeth two in one flesh, and not thrée or foure in one flesh.
The word of God must be followed, and not the examples of
the Fathers in this case.

               VINEGER.
               
                  Of the propertie thereof.
                  VIneger of it selfe is sharpe, sowre, and tart, and is no fitte
drinke to moisten a man that is a thirst. For though vineger
be colde in operation, yet is it dry and hath vertue exicatiue.
Therefore vineger is a sawce and no proper drinke. And
if it be dronken of him that is moist, it maketh him drye. But
if he be drye afore, it killeth him quickly, at y• least if it be strōg
vineger. And specially if it be such vineger as was giuen to
Christ hanging vpon the crosse,Psa. 69. 21 which (as S. Mathew saith)
was mingled with Gall. Saint Marke calleth it Vinum mirlatum,
Wine mingled with Mirre. Whervpon the worshipfull
Clarke Saint Bede doth gather vpon the wordes of S. Marke,
that they gaue vnto Christ wine mingled with Mirre, Mirre
is the Gumme of a certeine trée growing in Arabia, called
Mirre, which Gumme is both gréene and bitter like vnto gall.
This bitter tart drinke giuen vnto Christ, did both fulfill the
prophesie, which was that the Iewes should so vse Christ in
the time of his thirst, and also it made a spéedie end of his life.
For as soone as he had tasted of that tart and strong vineger,
he bowed downe his head and sayd: Consummatum est, All
is done. All the things which the Prophets haue fortold & spoken
of me, are now fulfilled.

is, the male commeth to the female, and putteth his head
into her mouth, which the female biteth off, and so killeth the
male, whose head ingendereth within the female a great sort
of egges, hanging togethers like beads, & when the time commeth
that she should bring them forth, shée putteth forth but
one, and yet is all a day in doing that. Then the other being
left within her are so greedie to come forth, that they gnawe
out her bodye, and so commeth forth and killeth the damme.

                  The vipers of all kinde of beasts is most pestiferous, for if
they do but scant touch a man, they bring violent death, as appeareth
by the men that in the Ile of Miletum, who when
they sawe the viper hang on Paules finger after his Shipwracke,
they sayd: Surely this man is a murtherer, whome
(although hée haue escaped the daunger of the Sea) vengeaunce
will not suffer to liue. But when they sawe him (the
viper cast into the fire) to haue no harme (for they thought he
shoulde haue béene burnt, or else sodeinly fall downe dead) they
altered their mindes and sayd hée was a God. So great daunger

                  THat is not true virginitie, when the body is restrained from
the naturall course & disposition of wedlocke, but when the
pure and maidly abstinence is to kept both in body & minde,
that by the disposition of God, all our lyfe is consecrate and
hallowed to better studies and purposes, for as touching the restraint
or countenance thereof, is to small purpose. For wée

finde many beasts also which doe not go to fellow, and therfore
Augustine doth a right cal virginitie, the vertue not of y• body
but of the minde. And the Apostle saith: that she may be an idle
sléeuelesse matter. But he thinketh it the part of virgins, to
thinke vpon these things which do apperteine vnto the Lord:
which is nothing els but with heart & mind to follow y• Lords
will accordingly, as the necessitie of the Saints and condition
of euery time doth require.

                  The places of S. Paule in this matter expounded.
                  He y• standeth stedfast in his hart hauing no necessity,1. Cor. 7. 37 but power
of his owne will, & hath determined in his heart to kéepe his
virgin doth well, & so he that marrieth his virgin doth wel, but
he that marrieth her not doth better. ¶S. Hierom expounding
this text, saith these words: Ille firmus statuit cuius puella consensus
patris firmauit voluntaria. He purposeth stedfastly whose
maidens consent, hath confirmed the fathers will. Then by S.
Hierome, the consent of the maide is required, without which
the father can order nothing.
                  
                     Erasinus in his Paraphrase vpon the same place saith: If any
man perceiuing that he hath libertie to bestow his virgin in
marriage, or not to bestow her, & is not compelled by néede to
either of both, & hath determined & purposed in his minde to
kéep his virgin at home, which desireth no marriage doth right.
For as it is ieoperdus to hold her frō marriage, y• is desirous
of marriage, so is it vngodly to discourage maids minds, from
the desire and vow of chastitie.
                  Note heere also y• S. Paule compelleth no man to vow, but hée
letteth euery man stand to his own wil. Furthermore be willeth
whatsoeuer he be that decréeth in his heart virginity, y• he
first consider whether it lieth in his power to kéep his decree or
not. If it be in his power then (saith S. Paule) doth he better to
kéepe his virginitie then to marry.
                  As concerning virgins (saith S. Paule) I haue no precept of ye
Lord,1. Cor. 7. 25 but alonely I giue you my counsell, &c. ¶Note y• S. Paul
wold not binde y• 
                     Corinthians to virginity
                        •
                      because he wold not
tangle them in a snare, but alonely he exhorteth them to virginity,
as vnto an honest & comely thing, y• they might the more
quietly serue God. Upon the same text saith Athanasius that y•
Apostle would compell no man to keepe virginitie against his

will, nor he would not make virginity a thing of necessitie.
                  S. Paule prouing cléerely that no man ought or can be bound
to virginitie, further then the gift of God doth strengthen him,
saith thus: As concerning virgins I haue no precept of y• Lord,
but onely I giue you my counsell, for I think it good by y• reason
of this present necessitie that a man should liue so. As hée
would say, vnto virginitie I cannot binde you, further then
your gift is, nor I doe not recken it a thing necessarie to win
heauen by. For heauen is neither the price of virginity nor yet
of marriage, but alonely I recken virginity a good & an expedient
thing to liue quietly by in this world. For in marriage is
many things y• doth distract & disturbeth a mans minde. That
this is S. Paules meaning it is well proued by the text y• followeth:
If a virgin doth marrie, she doth not sinne, but she shal
haue much temptation in the flesh, that is to say, many occasions
of disquietnesse. But I (saith S. Paule) would gladly spare
you from such occasions, for I wold haue you without sorrow.
And she that is vnmarried hath no care but how to serue God,
but she that is married hath much care and sorrow, how shee
shall dispatch all worldly businesse. So that Saint Paule doth
cleerely declare his meaning, how that virginitie is no néerer
way to heauen then marriage is, sauing that alonely an vnmarried
person hath not so many occasions to be disquieted, as
the married hath. Héere we sée that Saint Paule hath no commaundement
to binde men to chasttitie, and yet the Pope
compelleth all Priests to forsweare marriage, and to vow chastitie.
                  But if any man thinke,1. Cor. 7. 
                           •
                        6 &c. ¶Héere we learne that it is y• parents
part to marry forth their children. For in the olde time
no contract of matrimony tooke effect, without authoritie of the
parents. Read Deu. 7. 3. Also parēts ought to prouide betimes
for their children, & in no wise to compell them either to virginitie
or to wedlocke, vnlesse they sée them to misuse thēselues.
Read Gen. 24.

                  S. Hierome sayth: Si quis consideret virginem suam, &c. If
any man consider that his owne virgin, that is to say his own
flesh, groweth proud, & boileth vnto lust and cannot stay it, ther
is laied vpon him a double necessitie, either to take a wife or to
fall.

                  Wherefore virginitie is praised.
                  S. Paule praiseth virginitie in them that are apt and able to
embrace that state of liuing,Melancth. that they might with more speede
go forth to preach, and to serue the congregations. He praiseth
it not because he iudgeth that state to deserue the more grace,
for this errour fighting against ye iustificatiō of faith, he most of
all abhorreth. We deny it not (saith Melancthon) but y• ther be
distinct states of liuing. The Maior of the citie excelleth y• shipmaister,
but yet deserueth not the Maior more grace for gouerning
the citie then the Shipper for ruling the Ship. Yea, it is
possible that the shipper may worship God better in his ship,
then the Maior in the citie. Wherefore these degrées differ not
concerning the spirituall life by faith, or any grace therby to be
obteined, although they conferred together in y• externe life one
excelleth another: for God willeth an order to be in offices and
states of liuing.

                     Aeneas Siluius, otherwise Pope Pius the second, in describing
of Asia minor. cap. 74. reciteth a certeine fact of a worthy virgin,
who at what time the Turkes were besieging a certeine
towne in Lesbos,
                     The Ile of Lesbos preserued by a virgin. and had cast downe a great part of the walls,
so y• al the towns men had giuen ouer, putting on a mans harneis,
stepped forth into the breach, where not only she kept the
Turks from entring in, but 
                        •
                     lue of them a great sort. The citizens
séeing the rare courage & good successe of the maide, toke
to them againe their heart and harneis, and so lustely laied about
them that an incredible number of the Turks wer slaine.
The rest being repulsed from the land, reculed into their ships,
who being then pursued by a nauie of Calisa, were worthely
discomfited likewise vpon the sea. And thus was the Ile of Lesbos
at that time, by a poore virgin, that is, by the strong
                        •
                      hand
of the Lord working in a weake creature preserued from the

                  THe vniuersall Church is a multitude gathered of all
manner of nations,Apoc. 1. 4 which béeing sette a sunder and dispearsed
by distaunce of places, doth neuerthelesse consent in
the one truth of the heauenly doctrine, and is knitte together
in one selfe same bonde of religion. But for as much
as it is not possible for all Christs members, to growe together
into one place: vnder the vniuersall Church are comprehended
the seuerall Churches which are disposed in euery
Towne and Uillage, according as mans necessitye requireth:
So as each one of them doth worthely beare the
name and authoritie of the Church. In the same sense doth
Paule saye, that he had a dayly care for all Churches. 2. Cor. 11.

eateth and drinketh his owne damnation, because he maketh
no difference of the Lords body, and not because he eateth the

               VOVVE.
               
                  The definition of a vowe, and what a vowe is.
                  AUows is a testification of a willing promise made vnto
God, of things which appertain vnto God: but a vow which
is vowed by the parent for the sonne, cannot séeme willing. Yea
but it is: because the parents vowed not being compelled, but
of their owne frée will. Farther it is méete for the children to
obey the will of the parents fréely & of their owne accord, especially
when they commaund no vngodly thing contrary to the
word of God.
Pet. Mar. vpon Iudic. fol. 203.
                  
                  A vowe may be taken two waies: for vowing signifieth to
make a deuout or solemne promise, and also to wish and desire.
So that a vow signifieth sometime a promise made vnto God, &
sometime a desire. Lyke as the Gréekes do vse these two words
Eukeoon & Eukij, in these two senses, we be wont in vowing to
desire & earnestly request some thing of God, & therefore a vow
is oftentimes taken for a desire & praier. So when these things
which we haue desired, do fall out according vnto our mind, we
say we haue our wish or vow: & they haue their wil which haue
their desire. But the proper meaning of the word is to signifie
a promise, and that not euery manner of promise, but the same
which is deuoutly & holily made vnto God: if you promise any
thing to a man, or to any other creature, it may well be called
a promise, but not a vowe. The master of the sentences, doth define
it after this manner: A vowe is a certaine testifieng or
witnessing of a willing promise, which must be made properly to
God, & of those things which do belong vnto God.

not this worde, but they vnto whome it is giuen. Math. 9. 11.

is the vowe of virginitie. To be a virgin is not euill of it selfe,
and in case thou haue vowed it, looke well how to be able to

performe thy vowe, and that not onely in thy body, but in thy
spirit also: specially that thou offend not by the meanes of this
vowe. As the Apostle witnesseth, It is better to marrye then
to burne. Beside this, in case a man shuld vow to abstain from
those things which nature it selfe can hardly doe, and without
which the life of man cannot well be sustained, but fall into
daungerous diseases, if he will indéed performe the same which
he hath vowed, it is a daungerous and vnpleasaunt vowe vnto
God.

                  What a vowe is, and what vowes were appointed
of God, and what forbidden.
                  A vowe was a free will offering of some thing to the honour
or seruice of God,Free-will offering. vsed in Moses law. And whensoeuer the people
were disposed to vowe, that is, of his owne frée will to offer
to God (which was when he offered to the Temple or Tabernacle
of God) they did offer one of these foure things: either
his owne selfe, or his beast, or his house, or some part of his land,
and his frée will offering was one of the things that God appointed
for the Priests liuings, as in the 18. of Nu
                           •
                        
                      and in diuers
other places of the olde Testament, ye shall finde that the Leuiticall
Priests and Ministers of the Temple had no portion
nor inheritaunce with the other 11. Tribes, but that Gods owne
part should be theirs, which was the tithes of all the countrey,
with the commodities of 48. cities with their Suburbes, which
Cities wer all Cities of learning as our Uniuersities be. This
was their portion. Num. 35. And to the maintenaunce of their
liuing, God appointed sixe things: foure of them were certaine
and standing, and two stoode but vpon the frée offering, and deuotion

of the people. The foure things standing were these:
The first fruites of all manner graine and spices,What things were appointed for the Priests liuings. with other
commodities. The second, y• first birth or first begotten of euery
liuing thing. If it were of a man, the Parents should redéeme
it with money. If it were of a beast that the Priest could not
eate, nor could not be offered it should be redéemed with money
also. The third was the tenths of y• Leuites tithes. The fourth
were certaine Cities, which were common to them with ye Leuites.
These foure were standing. The other two were but casualties
which passed all the other: The one was the daylye
Oblations and Sacrifices that were offered vp to God in the
Temple: and the other was the vowes of the frée-will offering
of the people.The mās redemp. If it were a man that had offered vp himselfe, betwéene
20. yeares and 60. his redemption should be
                        •
                      50. Sicles.
If it were a woman, hir fine was 30. Sicles. If it were a poore
man not able to redéeme himselfe with the former summe,The womans red. then
to agrée with the Priest for as little as he could. If it be a beast
that was vowed, either it was cleane or vncleane,the beasts fine. that is, it
was mans meate or otherwise. If it were no mans meate,
as an Horse, an Asse, a Camell, a Swine, &c. Then the
Priest might sell it to whom he would. And if the owner wold
buye it againe, then he must giue the fift penie aboue that hée
was bidden for it of another man. If it wer a clean beast y• was
offered, then it could not be redéemed. The lyke fashion was
vsed for vowing of houses. Likewise also, if a man had vowed
a péece of land of his inheritaunce, looke what summe of corne
the ground would beare by the yeare, according to the same, he
should pay to the Priests vse, counting to the yeare of Iubely,
which was euery 7. yeare. Concerning those two points, that
no ground should be plowed nor tilled, nor no debtes nor lawe
dayes kept to plead for any iniury. And euery 50 yeare was the
great Iubely,
                     Yeare of Iubely. in the which also if anye man had morgaged and
pledged his land to his neighbour, or had vowed it to the Temple,
the land shuld in the great Iubely neuertheles return home
to ye right heires. So that if any man had vowed a part of his
land vnto the Lord, the yerely rent thereof, according to the value,
was to be paid vnto the Priests vntill the yeare of Iubely
came. Thus ye know to what vse and purpose the vow went to
the finding and increasing of the Priests liuing. Read. Leu. 27.

hir vowe was not to be kept: but he hearing of his wiues vow
and not denieng, both he and she stood bound to y• perfourmance
of the vow. These are y• onely lets which be expressed in Moses
lawe, why a vowe should not be perfourmed. All other men, and
also widowes making a vow, was by the law of Moses bound
to paye his vowe.
                  The vowe of the Nazarei, that is, of the abstainer, when hée
vowed abstinence vnto the Lord,Vowe of an abstainer. he was bound to abstain from
wine, and from all manner of strong drinke, & from things that
was made of grapes. Also he might not suffer his beard nor his
head to be shaueu, but the lockes of his haire to grow, and the
tufts of his beard lykewise. Moreouer he might not be present
at the death of any man, neither father nor mother, brother nor
sister. And kéeping this 3. points during his abstinence, he was
an holy Nazarei, according to ye law of Moses. This done & obserued,
they should come to the Temple dore, and there offer an
he Lambe of a yeare olde for a burnt offering, and a Ram for
a peace offering, with a basket of swéete Cakes sprinkled with
oyle for a meat offering. This oblation done, the Nazarei was
shauē before ye temple dore, & so departed with this blessing spoken
of ye priest: Benedicat tibi Dominus, & custodiet te, os
                           •
                        ēdat
tibi faciē suā, & misereatur tui. Here is all y• the old Testament
speaketh of vowes, which vowes with the ceremonies and sacrifices,
were ordeined by y• Holy ghost for ye people, & for y• time
only, to ye end partly to kéep them from y• Idolatry of ye heathen,
& frō y• works of their own inuentions, & partly by these vows &

Ceremonies to maintaine the Leuiticall seruice and ministration
of the Tabernacle vntill the comming of Christ, which
was the ende of the lawe. This could not be without Priestes
and other inferiour Ministers: nor the Priests could not be honestly
and liberally prouided for without liuings. Therefore
God appointed vnto them sixe things of the which vowes was
one. Héere is all that can be spoken of vowes, taking this word
(Uowe) in his proper kinde and signification. As soone therfore
as ye heare the name of a vowe, by and by remember that ye
are in the olde Testament, and in the bowells or in the shadow
of Moses lawe, and cleane out of the Gospell: for by the Gospell
we are cleane rid from the lawe of Moses, both Iudicialls
and Ceremonialls, and vowes were a parte of the Ceremonialls.Christian men haue nothing to doe vvith vowes.
They that be of Christs religion hath no more to do with
Uowes, then they haue with Burnt-offering, Peace offering,
Meate offering, Altars, Censers, Candlestickes, the Paschall
Lambe, Cleansing, &c, with an infinite number moe, which as
Saint Peter saith, neither we nor our forefathers were able to
beare. Christ hath made vs frée from all these baggages.
                  In the new Testament ther is no mention made of vowes,
properly in their owne signification.Paule did not shaue his hed to establish the vovv of the Nazareis among the christians nor in circūcising Timothy allovved circumcision. All that may be obiected,
is, where S. Paule shaued his head at Cenchrea, for he hadde a
vowe saith the text (vnderstand the vow of the Nazarei) which
place doth séeme that S. Paule did allowe the vowes of the Nazareis,
to be retained among the Christians, which was nothing
so. For in the 16. of the Actes ye shal read that S. Paule did circumcise
Timothy at Derba and Listria, not because he allowed
Circumcision, but to beare with the time, and with the weakenesse
of the Iewes, wherby he might the better perswade them,
and allure them to the faith of Christ. For the same purpose did
he shaue his head in Cenchrea, faining himselfe to the sight of
the Iewes to haue bene a Nazarei when he was nothing lesse,
but onely to win the Iewes by a little and a little, & was content
to vse an holy & charitable dissimulation (as I might say)
onely for this purpose, that he might win them to Christ. That
this was S. Paules practise, he himselfe confesseth, in y•. 1. Co. 9.
22. saieng: I framed and fashioned my selfe to please all men, only
to this end, that I might win them to Christ. This place ye
see, maketh nothing for the establishing of vowes.
                  
                     
                     Votum, is sometime taken of the Lawiers, Propteractis &
promissis ciuilibus, as we would say:Votum 
                     Vir iustus est vota & promissa
prestare: The propertie of a good man & a righteous liuer,
is to performe all his couenaunts & bargaines. And now, this
word (Votum) is borrowed out of the olde Testament. We call
commonly our profession in Baptime, a vow, which is not properly
to be called a vow, forasmuch as a vow is a worke of a
mans owne frée will. But let it be that our profession be taken
for a vow, which vow if we kéepe, all other monasticall vowes
are but vaine, vnprofitable, foolish, wicked and full of hipocrisie:
for either it must be graunted, that these vowes (as they call
them) of chastitie, of puritie, and of obedience, either they are
workes commaunded of God, or els workes mo or other then
God hath commaunded, what a blasphemous pride is it, & what
a presumpteous hypocrisie is it, to doe more for our own vowing,
then for Gods commaunding. Were not that souldier worthy
of wages, that would doe nothing at the commaundement
of his Captaine, but that which he first had vowed of his owne
frée will to serue his Captaine. And againe,Souldier If we doe other
things then those which God hath commaunded vs, all our labour
is but in vaine. For Christ saith, Frustra colunt 
                           •

                     Vow of the Nazarites. as it is manifestly set forth
in the 6. of Num. But those things which are ther written may
all be reduced to thrée principall points. The first was, they
should drinke no wine, nor strong drinke, nor anye thing that
might make them dronke. Another was, that they shuld not poll
their head: but all that time the Nazarite should let his hayre
grow. The third was that they shoulde not defile themselues
with mourning for vnrialls, no, not at the death of their father
or mother. These things wer to be obserued only for some certaine
time, for he vowed to be a Nazarite, but for certein number
of dayes, months or yeares.

no such vow: for I haue now learned by experience, that I am

not able to perfourme it. Unles therefore God be fauourable &
mercifull vnto me for Christs sake and graunt vnto me a blessed
and an happy houre when I shall depart out of this miserable
life, I shal not be able with all my vowes, and all my good
deedes, to stand before him. ¶This was not onely a true but also

and Thumim perfectnesse,Exo. 28. 30 and I thinke the one wer stones,
that did glister & had light in them, & the other cleere stones as
Christall, and the light betokened the light of Gods word, & the
purenesse, cleane liuing according to the same, & was therof called
the example of the children of Israel, because it put them in
remembrance to séeke Gods word, and to do there after. T. M.
¶Vrim & Thumim signifie light & perfectnes, out of ye which it
pleased God to giue aunsweres, oracles & iudgments, but what
they were it doth not well appeare to any writer. They were
placed in the Priests breast, to admonish him, that he ought to
shine in doctrine, and to be perfect in conuersation of life.

               VSVRIE.
               
                  The definition of vsury.
                  VSurie according to the schoolemen is said to be a gaine that
commeth through lending by couenaunt, or by chiefe intent
or purpose. As for example: I doe lend to receiue more then I
laid out: I do couenaunt to haue more, & my chiefe purpose in
laieng out my money is, by my principall to increase my stock,
& hope by my lending to receiue an ouerplus: for wher these 3.
things concurre together, lending, gaine & a principall or chiefe
purpose to increse wel
                        •
                     are, in such deling, vsury is alwaies most
certainly known. Other define vsury thus: vsury is whatsoeuer
is takē for ye loue aboue ye principal: vsury is a certain gain due
or exacted for lēding or by couenant agreed vpō. S. Barnard saith
that Usury is a lawfull theft or a theft in law. The ciuill law

it selfe, or rather the Emperour Iustinians statute, telleth before
hand what is intēded, y• is to rob by order & sufferance of law.
Usury is also said to be ye price of time, or of y• delaieng or forbering
of mony. Melācthō
                      doth define vsury on this manner: vsury
or fenory is a gaine demaunded aboue the principall, onely
for the benefit or pleasure shewed in lending.

                  What vsury is.
                  S. Hierom. li. 6. vpon Ezechiel, writeth on this wise:Hierom some
folkes do surmise that vsury doth consist onely in mony, which
the scripture of God did foresée, and therefore taketh awaye the
ouerplus of all things. Item, others are w
                        •
                     nt to take sundry
sorts of rewards or presents for their lending of their money,
and doth not vnderstand that the Scripture doth call that an vsury
and an ouerplus, whatsoeuer it be, that they receiue again
more then that which they gaue.
Mus. fol. 579.
                  
                  S. Ambrose
                     Ambrose speaking of Naboth saith: that many men to auoide
the daunger of the commaundementes of the lawe when
they haue giuen out their money vnto occupiers & merchaunt
men, doe not demaund their vsuries in money, but doe take the
commoditie and profit of vsury vpon their wares. Therfore let
them hearken what the law saith: Nor you shall not take anye
vsury of meats, nor of any other thing. So that a dish of meate
is vsury, and a garment is vsury, and whatsoeuer commeth aboue
the principall is vsury, and what name soeuer ye giue it.
yet it is vsury.
Muscu. fol. 579.
                  
                  S. Austen defineth vsury on this sort: In case thou lend out
thy money to any man,Augustin of whome thou lookest to receiue more
then thou deliueredst forth, not mony only, but many thing els,
more then thou deliueredst forth, whether it be Corne, or wine,
or Oyle or any other thing: if thou lookest to receiue any more
then thou deliueredst, thou art an vsurer and worthy to bee blamed.
Muscu. fol. 579.
                  
                  
                     Chrisostome doth compare the ioye of them, which doe take
money vpon vsury,Chrisostō
                      vnto the biting of an Adder: for like as he
which is bitten with an Adder, falleth with a certaine delight
into sleep, & in the sweetnesse of his deadly sléepe dyeth by reson
that by y• meanes of his sléeping, y• poyson passeth ouer, throughout
all y• parts of his body: so he which receiueth mony vpon interest,
doth so reioice for ye present, as if had receiued a good turn

the vsurie doth in continuance, so sucke vp his substance, that it
turneth it all into debt.
Muscu. fol. 580.
                  
                  Usury is, when more is required then was deliuered or giuen:
As if thou deliuerest ten shillings and seekest more. Or if thou
deliuer a bushell of wheat, & receiuest aboue that, that is vsury.

                  God hath forbidden vsury, adding this reason:Psal. 15. If my people
happen to be brought low, thou shalt not grieue him with vsury.
We see that the lawe was made to the end that men should
not cruelly oppresse the poore, who were worthy to be pit

                     ed rather.
Now although the law which God gaue to the Iewes peculiarly,
wer but politike: yet not withstanding this vprightues
that we shuld not deuoure such as are miserable & bare, is common
to al nations & to al ages. Wher vpon it followeth y• vnder
vnlawful vsury is not comprehended the gaine y• a man maketh
of the lone of his money, without y• hurt of any person. Also the
name of (Neshed) which Dauid vseth, being deriued of (Biting)
declareth sufficiently y• vsurers are condemned so farre forth as
they draw with thē a liberty to pil & poll. Surely Eze. y.• 18. & ve.
17. & the. 22. ver. 12. séemeth to condemne any kind of ouerplus.
Notwithstāding ther is no doubt but he had respect to wrongful
& polling policies of gaining, wherewith y• rich sort did bite
ye needy. Now then at a word, if the rule of vprightnesse which
Christ prescribeth. Ma. 7. 12. be grauen in our hearts, so as euery
man do to his neighbour, as he would be done vnto himselfe,
there shuld need no long disputation concerning vsury.

                     Cato doth match vsury and manslaughter almost in one
degrée:Cato because it is the purpose of such kinde of people to suck
other mennes bloud. For it is a verye vnmeete thing, that
while all other men get their liuing painefully by their trauaile
(as the Plowman by tiring himself with dayly woork, the
handye craftes men by seruing other folkes turnes with sore
sweating, and the Marchaunt men not onely by busieng themselues
with labours, but also by vndertaking manye inconueniences
and daungers) onely the money-mongers sitting still,
shoulde take tribute of euery mans labours.
               
               
                  
                  Against the vsurer that alledgeth to haue no trade
to liue by, but onely by the lone of his
money.
                  The vsurer also presumeth to say:Aug. psa. 128. I haue none other trade
to lyue by: so may the strong theefe saye when he is taken by
the throte with the manner: so may the buggerer say when hée
is laid hand on for committing buggery: so may the bawde say
that selleth young maidens to be common harlots: so may the
Sorcerer say, when he or she inchaunteth euill things, and sell
their inchauntments. And whatsoeuer lyke thing we shuld goe
about to forbid, they might all aunswere, they hadde none other
way to liue by, and to finde themselues, as though this wer not
chiefely to be punished in them, because they haue learned the
art or occupation of wickednes to get their liuing by it, and
will thereby feede themselues, whereby they offende him, by
whom we are all fed. Thus farre Augustin.

                  NO man shall enter into holy orders or be of the ministery,33. d. Martis d. 46. seditio.
that by lawe is conuicted and found to put out his money to vsurie.
And in another place: We doe ordeine, that no vsurer,
shall be made one of the Cleargie.
                  It was ordeined in the Nice. Councell, that such of the Clergie
as put out their money for vsury,Consiliū Nicen. 18 taking twelue in the hundred
or lesse, shall be degraded from all their degrées of Ecclesiasticall
office, and made irriguler, because they haue sought to
liue by filthie gaine, contrary to the expresse word of God.
                  Pope Martin in the Councell he called,Ex conci. Ma. Papa. saith: If a man forgetting
the feare of God & the holy scriptures which do say (Hée
that hath not giuen his money to vsury, shal enter into the Tabernacle
of God) do after knowledge had of this generall councel
commit vsury, or take Centesimam vsuram, which is twelue
in the hundred, or by any filthy trade doth make his gaine, taking
for diuers sorts of things, for either wine or corne or any
other thing els by buying and selling, more then he hath layed
out, shall be put out of the Clergie for euer.
                  Pope Leo doth also forbid the same in the laitie, being very
sory y• any christian man shuld be an vsurer, saieng: that y• Clergie
ought to be the more sharply punished for such offence, because

all others should be the more afraid to offend, when the
Clergie is not spared. The decree saith further, that no almes
ought to be giuen of euill gotten good, which cannot be worse
gotten then by vsury.
               
               
                  A statute made against vsurie, by a Christian
Emperour called Leo.
                  Although (saith this godly Emperour) many of our auncestors
haue thought that lending for vsury might be admitted,Hermeno polus. li. 3 tit. 7 &
onely for that the creditours were so hard, & as men loth els to
lend: yet we haue thought it most vnworthy among the Christians,
& to be vtterly abhorred & eschewed as a thing forbidden
by the law of God. Therefore our Maiestie doth commaunde,
that it be not lawfull for any man to take vsury for any cause,
least whiles we go about to keepe the lawes & statutes of men,
we do transgresse thereby the law of God. But whatsoeuer any

                  TO walke with God is to liue godly,Gen. 5. 22. and to walke in his
commaundements: Enoch walked with God, and was no
more séene, he liued godly and dyed. God tooke him away, that
is, hidde his body as he did Moses and Aaron, least haply they
should haue made an Idoll of him, for he was a great preacher
and an holy man.

himselfe to the seruice of God, as he thinketh continually to
giue an account, & acknowledgeth in himselfe after this manner:
he that hath created & formed, gouerneth & guideth me, I
cannot shun his hand nor scape his iudgemēt, & therfore I must
be present before his eyes, so as he shall sée, not onely all my
works, but also my thoughts: lo, what it is to walk with God,
&c. It is said that Enoch walked with God, & why? Because he
was not peruerted, and although the whole worlde was
at that time as corrupt as might be, yet notwithstanding Enoch
continued vncorrupted, & wherof came that? Because he
gathered his wits to him, and gaue not himselfe the bridle to
deale disorderly: but although iniquity was a waterflud vpon
the earth, yet he knew that it behoued him, to walke as in the
presence of God.

               VVARRES.
               
                  What manner of warres is iust.
                  SUch a warre is counted iust, which is taken in hand at
the comma
                        •
                     ndement of the magistrate, either to demaund
things again, or els to put away iniuries or to reueng thē, as
it is had in the 23. quest, the 2. chap. iustum, & they are ye words
of Isidorus. For first we must beware y• war be not taken in
hand, by the authoritie of a priuate mā. But the causes wherfore
war may iustly be made, are these: To require things taken
away, or else to repulse iniurie, wherevnto is agréeable

that which Augustine writeth in ye same place in the chapter
Dominus. Iust warre is that which is taken to reuenge iniuryes.
After this manner warres is proclaimed against
Cities, when they will not either render things taken away,
or amend those things which of theirs was vniustly done. For
if they will not punish the guiltie, it is lawfull for other to
make warre against them. So all Israel tooke warre against
the Beniamites, that a most wicked crime should not remaine
vnpunished. But Augustine addeth that those warres also do
especially séeme iust which are taken in hand by the commandement
of God, as are many which are done in the olde Testament.
For if God once commaund to make warre, we maye
not seeke any other cause of iustice, for God knoweth very wel
what is best to be rendered to euery man. For then both Captaine
and souldiers are not so much to be counted authours of
the warre, as ministers of God and of his lawe. And therefore
when the people are after this manner called to warre, they
ought not neglect the commaundement. Wherefore the same
Augustin in his. 205. Epistle to Bonifacius the Earle a man of
war, which at that time gouerned Affrick vnder Caesar. Thou
oughtest not (saith he) to thinke, y• they which with weapons
serue ye publik wealth, cannot please God. This was his propositiō,
wherof afterward he bringeth resons. For Dauid (saith he)
mode many wars, & yet was he dearely beloued of God.

                  What things are to be taken heed of in iust warres.
                  In making of iust warres (saith Augustine) many things are
to be taken héed of. For it is not sufficient that the war be iust
except also the world be iustly handled, wherefore he admonisheth
his Earle: when (saith he) thou puttest on thine armour,
remember that thy strength is the gift of God, and determine
with thy selfe, not to abuse that gift against God, yea, rather
doe this, fight for his lawes and name, let promises be kept,
euen with enimies, but much more with friends, for whome
thou makest warre, by which wordes he reprehendeth those
souldiers which are more grieuous in Cities then the very enimies.
Of which we sée in our daies a greate many moe then
we wold, which when they are in their places where they winter,
it is wonderfull to see how they handle the citizens and the

men of the country it is horrible to sée what filthy and abhominable
things they commit. He addeth also the third Cantion:
Thinke with thy selfe that warre must not bée made, but for
necessitie, wherefore let thy minde alwaye be enclined vnto
peace. Make warre because thou canst not otherwise doe, but
if thou canst make peace, refuse it not.

                  Reasons for warre.
                  A time of warre, & a time of peace. Eccles. 3. 8. Dauid saith
in. 144. Psalme. Blessed is God which teacheth my hands to
fight, and my fingers to battell. Dauids fingers were fighting
fingers, yet Dauids fingers were holy fingers. In the booke of
Kings Dauid saith thus to Saule: Thou fightest the Lordes
battailes: And Abigal sayth to Dauid: Thou fightest the Lords
battailes. If some warres be Gods warres, then all warres
are not forbidden. The Baptist doth séeme to allow of Souldiers,
for he giueth them rules of life, as that they should hurt no
man, and that they should be content with their owne wages.
Paule wold haue himselfe lead to Caesaria by strength of souldiers.
Our Sauiour doth say, giue vnto Caesar that which is
Caesars. That which was giuen to Caesar was tribute, giuen
to finde souldiers, as Augustine doth often say. Now, reasons

why ther shuld be wepons, ther be many. But this is y• speciall
reson which ye 
                     Cantons, wher euery man wereth a weapon
alledge for their so doing, that the magistrate & country may be
assisted and defended. And euery man do weare wepon, & ought
to weare wepon for the magistrate, & ought not only to weare
it, but also to drawe it at the Magistrates voice, & to do as it is
said in the. 3. booke & fourth Chapter of Esdras: If the king alone
saie, Doe kill, they do kill: If he say: do forgiue they forgiue: If
he say smite, they do smite: If he say banish: they do banish: If
he saye cut off, they cut off. I say, if the people ought thus to do
for ye Prince & magistrate, to draw their weapons in his cause,
& to lay downe their life at their foote: how much more ought
the magistrate for his owne cause and for all their causes to
beare weapon, and not to beare it in vaine, but to purpose, &c.

Rome too apishly foolloweth Christ in many thinges. And in
this he would seeme to follow Christ, washing once in a yeare,
the feete of certeine poore folkes, which haue bene washed before,
and not onely washed, but also perfumed, with swéete
odours and waters. And thus by a bare and naked ceremony,
they thinke that they haue done very well. And when they
haue done it, they can be con
                        •
                     ēted, to contemne their brethren,
and cruelly to teare the members of Christ and to spit in his
face. Wherfore that comminical pompe, is nothing else, but a
filthy scorning of Christ. And verely Christ doth not héere
commend vnto vs a yearely ceremonie: but commaundeth vs
all our lyfe time to be ready to wash our bretherens féete.
                  When Abigal sayd to the messengers of Dauid, Beholde, let
thine handmaide be a seruaunt to wash the féete of the seruants
of my Lord: shée meant not such a counterfeit seruice,
as the imitating enimies of Christ doe vse, but she meant that
she would be so obedient, loyall, and seruable to Dauid, that
she would not refuse to wash, euen the feet of his seruants. So
Saint Paule vnderstoode washing of the féete, when hée
required the good and vertuous widow to be a washer of the
Saints féete, that is to saye, to be serueable to them in each
point, Christ sayth not, ye ought to wash my féete, but to wash
one an others féete.

finde nothing that séemeth more likely then this. For that the bodyes of them that hadde appointed to be baptised (at Easter)

                  WAtch is not onely to absteine from sleepe, but also to be circumspect,
and to cast all perills, as a man should watch
a Towre or Castle: we must remember that the snares of
the diuell are infinite and innumerable, and that euerye moment
arise new temptations, and that in all places méete vs
fresh occasions, against which we must prepare our selues and
turne to God, and complaine to him and make our moue, & desire
                        •
                     
him of his mercy to be our shield, our towre, our castle, & defence
from all euill, to put his strength in vs) for wt out him we

can do nothing) and aboue all thing we must call to minde
what promises God hath made, and what he hath sworne, that
he will doe to vs for Christs sake, and with strong faith cleaue
vnto them, and desire him of his mercie, and for the loue hée
hath to Christ, and for his truths sake to fulfill his promises. If
we thus cleaue to God with strong faith & beléeue his words.
Then (as sayth Paule) God is faithfull that he will not suffer
vs to be tempted aboue that we are able, or aboue our strength,
that is to say
                        •
                     , if we cleaue to his promises, and not to our
owne fantasies and imaginations, he wil put might and power
into vs, that shall be stronger then all temptations, which he
shall suffer to be against vs.

which were the peruerters and deprauers of the law of God.
These for filthy lucre sake abolished the true seruice of God,
and were the chiefe causers of the forsaking of Israel. They
were sluggish and sought not that which was for the edification
of the people and for the glory of God, but that which was
for their owne priuate profit and pleasure. They were slothfull
to roote out vice and to plant vertue, and driuen into the
profound déepe sléepe of ignorance, of idlenesse, of lecherousnesse,

vpon this condition, that we should by the spirit be made lyke
vnto him. And therefore that wee might continuallye abide
in his house, wée must put off the olde man, with all his
pollutions and defiling spottes of sinne, and must frame and
giue our selues to a newe lyfe, that our apparell maye
aunswere so honourable a calling. They therefore are clothed
with this wedding garment, which haue put on the Lord Iesus
Christ, and the new man, which after God is shaped in righteousnesse
and holynesse, and as the wedding garment doth
declare the minde to bee ioyfull affected towarde the wedding
dinner, and to reuerence the same, euen so also by this wedding
garment, there is required that the guest

dayes, but for a wéeke of years, so that euery wéeke is counted
for seuen yeares. And the halfe yeare that he speaketh of, is
taken for ye thrée years & an halfe, wherin Christ héere in earth
stablished his Testament.

                     AVgustine in his 4. Sermon of the first Sundaye in Lent,
writeth that there bée two causes of true repentaunce, that
bringeth forth wéeping. One is, for because we haue through
negligence omitted many things, which we ought not to haue
done. These are commonly called sins of committing & omitting.
And in ye same place he interpreteth this sentence (Bring
forth worthy fruit of repentance) after this manner, that wee
should wéepe for the sinnes already committed, and we should
take héede that we doe not the same againe Chrisostome also
vpon the Epistle to the Collossians, the. 12. homely complaineth
that the christians abused teares. And when as otherwise
teares are good creatures of God, they defame them in adioyning
them to those things which deserue not weeping. Sinnes
onely (sayth he) are to be wept for, not onely our owne sins, but
other mens also. Which Paule performed in very deede, who
in the second to the Corinthians, sayde, That he was afraide
not to come vnto them, but so that he was deiected and compelled
to wéepe for very many, which had fallen and not repented.
Yea, and hée exhorted the same Corinthians to wéepe for other
mens sinnes, when in the first Epistle he sayd, Ye are puffed
vp, and ye haue not mourned, namely, for the grieuous crime
of an incestuous man. And Dauid in his. 119. Psalme writeth:
Mine eyes haue brought forth riuers of waters, because they
haue not kept thy lawe. That holy Prophet wept, because of y•
publike transgressions of the lawe, & when he sawe the same
transgressions perpretated, he abundantly powred out teares,
&c.

                     Ezechiel in the. 8. chapter commended certeine which wept
for the wicked acts of other men. And héereof it commeth that
when holy men sée horrible spectacles of sinners oftentimes to
happen, they easilyer burst forth into teares, then into laughter,
for so Christ vsed, whom we read to haue oftentimes wept,
but neuer to haue laughed, which selfe same thing also we must
doe at this day, when as so great and euill an haruest of sins
doth on euery side offer it selfe vnto vs.

or that thing, we must aunswere that he did it because y•
it was his will so to doe. If thou goest any farther asking, why
it was his will so to doe, thou doest aske a thing which is both
greater and higher then ye will of God, which thing cannot be
found out.

on this wise: If a man haue many debters that doth owe
vnto him the like sum of money, doth it not lye in his power
to forgiue some of them the whole debt, & to call vpon the other
for the whole sum, who can lay any thing to his charge for so
doing. Then marke (saith he) we are all debters vnto God, and
haue all deserued euerlasting damnation, that he doth then of
méere mercy and goodnesse forgiue some, and to some againe he
doth according to righteous iudgement, who shall be so bolde
to blame him for it?

he) did beléeue y• were ordeined before to life euerlasting. Againe
he could doe it, saith S. Austen, because he is almighty:

doe to the good, but also that which the wicked doe to the

and principall faith in Christ, as a little before he saith: If any
man careth not for his owne, and chiefly for his owne houshold
he denieth to be a faithfull, and is worse then an infidell. For

                     Paule blameth those women, which so long as they wer néedie,
they would be sad and modest, seruing them faithfully: but afterward,
when they wer found of y• common charge, they began
to waxe wanton and light, and to neglect their office. For these
euill manners (saith he) that they reiected their chiefe faith or
principall promise to God, casting off their faith whereby
they should haue pleased God. For their very faith is reiected,
when their conscience is defiled. Beside this, if they contend
to be spoken of vowes, then are their owne selues condempned
with the same text, commaunding them to put back young persons
from such vowes, & to receiue none before 60. yeares old,
and why then call they it a lawfull vowe at 21. yeares? Also if
there had bene in those daies any such common vowes, surely
they had bene made without any superstition. Wherefore these
new found vowes of Monkes and Priests are tangled with full
many wicked perswasions, &c. ¶Looke.

                  How all things come to passe by Gods will.
                  THese be the great and most exquisite workes of God,Augu. in 
                           〈…〉

                      that
whereas the nature of man and Angell had sinned, that is
to say, had done not that he would, but that it would, euen by the
same will of the creature, whereby that was done, that the creator
would not, he fulfilled that he would, vsing wel euen euill
things as good, himselfe in the highest degree to the damnation
of them, whom he iustly fore-ordeined to punishment, and to the

saluation of them, whom he mercifully foreordeined to grace.
For touching themselues, they did that God would not, but touching
the omnipotencie of God, they could no way doe it. For
euen in this that they did against Gods will, Gods will was
fulfilled vpon them or touching them: for therefore great, and
exquisite are the Lords workes throughout all his will, that after
a meruailous and vnspeakable manner, that is not done beside
Gods will, that is done against Gods will.
                  Nothing is done that procéedeth not out of the inward and
intelligible Court of the souereigne Emperour,Augu. in the. 3. b. de Trinit. according to his
vnspeakable Iustice. For where doth not the wisedome of almightie
God worke that he will, which reacheth from ende to
ende strongly, and disposeth all things sweetely.
                  Againe, S. Austen hath these wordss: It is than his will only,
frō which is sprong whatsoeuer is. Also, nothing set in mans
frée will, ouercōmeth ye wil of God. And though man be against
Gods will, yet against his will which is himselfe, we ought to
think nothing to be so done, as though he wold haue it to be done,
& it is not done, or y• he would not haue to be done, & it is done.
For y• will is euer fulfilled, either touching vs, or of vs. Touching
vs it is fulfilled, but we fulfil it not when we sin. Of vs
it is fulfilled when we do good. Item, so of man also God euer
fulfilleth his will, for man doth, wherof God worketh not, that
he will. Item, Gods will is the necessitie of all things.
                  It is then in the power of the naughtie men to sin,Augustin but y• in
sinning the same naughtinesse shall doe this or this, it is not in
their power, but in the power of God, who diuideth darknesse &
ordereth it, that of this also that they do against Gods wil, there
is nothing fulfilled but Gods will.
Aug. in the 1. bo. of the
Predest. of Saints. cha. 16.
                  
                  Which holy scripture,Augu. in his bo. of freewil & gra. ca. 20 if it be diligently looked into, sheweth
that not only the good wils of men, which he made of euil wils,
and being made good by him, guideth to good acts, but also those
wils, y• continue ye creation of the world, be so in Gods power,
that he maketh them to be bowed, whether he will, & when hée
wil, either to do good to some, or to punish some, as he himself declareth
by his (most hidden indéede, but vndoubtedly) most iust
iudgmēt. For we find some sins to be punishmēts euen of other
sins. As in y• hardening of Pharao,
                     Pharao ye cause wherof is also declared

to shew Gods power in him. Wherefore the Lord saith to
Iosua,
                     Iosua. The Children of Israel shall not be able to stand. What
is this, they shall not be able to stand? why did they not stand by
their free-will, but fled, their will being troubled through feare,
sauing that God ruleth ouer the wills of men, & when he is angry,
turneth whom he wil into feare? Did not ye shameles man
that son of Iemini,
                     Simei. raile vpon king Dauid by his own wil? Neuertheles,
what saith Dauid: suffer him to raile, for y• Lord hath
cōmaunded him to raile vpon Dauid. Lo, how it is proued y•

God,In the same boo. cha. 31. whereby he worketh euen in y• hearts of euill men whatsoeuer
he will, rendring yet to them according to their deserts.
And againe, by these & such testimonies of the holy scripture, it
is made manifest inough, that God worketh in y• hearts of men,
to boow their wills whether soeuer he will, either to good things
according to his mercie, and to euill according to their deserts,
through his own iudgement without doubt, sometimes open,
sometimes hidden, but euer iust. Some will babble & say, if all
things come to passe according to Gods

                     oresight, prouidence, &
certain, vnmouable & vnchangeable ordiuaunce, then they will
make no prouision for meate to satisfie their hunger, they will
vse no medicine in their sicknes, they will not procure to auoide
any daunger, &c. for ye good things y• God hath ordeined for them,
they shall haue, & the euill y• God hath appointed, they cannot eschew.
So that either it shall not néede, or it shall not boote to
labor 
                        •
                     or ye obtaining of y• one, or auoiding of ye other, sith al must

                  O rude rabble, what if God will vse your labour, & the wisdome
and gifts wherewith he hath furnished you, to serue his
prouidence, will ye refuse to be his instruments, with all y• ye
haue of him? if it be his ordināce to feed you through your trauel,
wil you lye gaping till meat fal into your mouths frō y• clouds,
which you perceiue he hath not appointed. If it plese him to hele
you by y• vertue he hath giuē to herbs or other simples, & you wil
not be healed, I wold ye shuld be sick still. If he wil haue you to
escape daungers through y• wisedome y• he hath planted in your
harts, & you will not vse thē, you are worthy to perish in them,

and so God will vse your folly to your owne destruction. The
godly, euer lyke that well that pleaseth God, neither will they
shew themselues, so vnthankfull or so foolish, as to despise or refuse
the meanes that he hath appointed, and though they know
that nothing can come to passe, otherwise then he hath ordeined,
yet they know not whether this way or y• way, by this meanes
or that meanes, he will bring his purpose to passe, and therefore
they vse the meane with thankes that seemeth most lykely, according
to the wisedome that God hath giuen them. For whether
God worke things by him, or by those meanes and instruments,
that he hath appointed, all is one to them, and they acknowledge
his wisedome and goodnesse, as well in the one, as

                  How there is two wills in God.
                  The will of God is two manner of wayes considered in the
Scripture.Two wils in God. It doth ascribe vnto God an absolute will, which is
hidden from vs, and can in no wise be resisted, for whatsoeuer
God hath determined by his absolute will, it can neuer be altered.
Secondly, Scripture doth speake of the diuine and blessed
will of God, as it is set forth vnto vs in Gods holy word, wherby
we doe learne, what God will haue vs to doe, and what hee
will haue vs to leaue vndone: we do all contrary to this will,
when we do breake his commaundement. And so Adam doing
contrary to Gods will, brought himselfe to naught, and to vtter
destruction.

moueth him to be mercifull or to shew mercie and compassion,
is onely his blessed will and pleasure.

wer before wast wildernesses (by which vnderstand the errors
of the heathen, wherwith they had made all vnfruitfull & drye)

and of stinking errors, ther shall the harts of the chosen, be watered
with godly wisdome, through the Gospell & glad tidings,

All, and notwithstanding that they doe expound this place sundrye
waies, yet it is a cleere matter, that Christ spake neither
Greeke nor Latin, but Hebrue to the Hebrues, in the holy language
and accustomed sense. Therefore when he said y• the wisdome
of God was iustified of all his children, he meant nothing
els, but that he left nothing vndone toward his children, that is
to say, the people of the kingdome, which he had trayned vp as
his children, & in all things y• might belong to their saluation, &
that it was therefore free and cleere from all blame of their destruction
& perishing. And so Chrisostom doth also expound it. It
wer a very vnfit thing to expoūd it: the wisdome is iustified by
hir children, to say it is from vniust by the benefit of y• children
chaunged into iust and innocent. By thy words (saith y• Lord)
thou shalt be iustified, or by thy words condemned: y• is to say,
by thy words thou shalt be declared, either to be iust, or condemned

a better new apparell of women, saith thus: Prodite vos feminae,

bettered with the helps and ornaments of the Apostles, taking
white liues of simplicitie, and readynesse of shamefastnesse, hauing
your eyes painted with shamefastnesse, and your spirits
with secresie, putting into your eares the word of God, tieng
to your neckes the yoake of Christ, put vnder your neckes to
your husbands, and ye shall be well apparelled. Haue alwaies
what to doe in your hands, and fasten your féete at home, and
ye shall bee better lyked of them, and if ye were in gold: Clad

they open the gate to treason, to murther, to rapine and
theft. If the magistrate had lawfully condemned adulterye,
Christ would not haue absolued the same. He absolued her from
sin, if she repented, but he tooke not away the punishment & publike
example. Euen as also he receiueth the penitent & faithful
théefe, into the fauour & grace of God, but yet did not delyuer

to be attributed vnto women ouer men, for shee was made
for the man, whome shee ought alwayes to haue a regard to
obeye, which thing is also appointed her by the sentence of
God, whereby after sinne committed he said vnto the woman,
Thy lust shall perteine vnto thy husband. Farther the Apostle
giueth another reason, drawne from the first front, because
he saith: Eue was seduced and not Adam, wherfore if women
should ordinarily be admitted vnto the holye mysterie of the
Church, men might easily suspect that the Diuell by his accustomed

God. It is also put for the son of God, which is the second
person in the most reuerent Trinitie, for the saieng of the holy
Euangelist is euident to all men. The word was made flesh.

                  And the word was made flesh, &c.Iohn. 1. 14 That is to say, the euerlasting
word, which is the only begotten sonne of God, did take
our fraile nature and flesh vpon him, in the which (being equal
with the father touching his Godhead) he was made a curse
for vs, that is to say, he did take vpon him that malediction and
curse that was due vnto vs, for the breaking of the law of God.

soule, vniting the same to the person of his Godhead. S. Iohn
sayth not: Caro verbum facta est, as the Arrians expound it
and say, the flesh receiued the worde, but hée sayth: Verbum
caro factum est. The word was made flesh.
I. Proctour.
                  
                  ¶In that he sayth the word became flesh and not man, hée
sheweth how farre Gods sonne humbled and abased himselfe.
For the Scripture calleth man flesh, when he will signifie the
pouertie, vilenesse, and miserie of man. As when it is said, All
flesh is grasse, and he remembred that we were but flesh, & my
spirit shall not euer striue in man, for he is flesh. But when y•
Euangelist sayth, The word became flesh, we may not imagin
that Gods sonne ioyned to his diuine nature flesh only and not
mans soule, as Appolinaris thought in his traunce, that flesh
and the Godhead made one person without mans soule. For he
imagined that the diuinitie was in steede of a soule. But so it
should follow that the Lord Iesus was not a very man. For

flesh is not a man. For the soule is the formall part of a man,
namely, that wherby a man is a man, & without which a man
cannot be. And that the Lord had a mans soule beside his diuinitie,
he himselfe testifieth where he saith, My soule is heauy
vnto y• death. Neither can Appol

not that they are without soule, for then they were no men indeede.

Euangelist meaneth the second person in the holy Trinitie,
namely our Lord Iesus Christ touching his diuine nature, as
it appeareth afterward, when he saith, And the worde became
flesh.word takē 2. waies. Héere we must consider why Gods son is called a word.
Auncient writers consider a worde two wayes. For they
teach that there is an outward word, and an inward word.
The outward word is that foundeth and passeth awaye. The
inwarde worde is,How Christ is the fathers vvord. the conceite of the heart, which remaineth
still in the heart, when the sound is past. So they saye that
God hath an outward worde, which is sounded, pronounced
and written in bookes: And that hée hath an inwarde worde,
which remaineth within himselfe, whereof the outwarde
worde is an Image, effect and fruite. This inwarde worde
euer remaining in him is called his sonne, as the conceite of
the heart maye bée called the ingendered fruite of the heart,
and the heartes childe. They thinke also that he is called the
worde of God, because that as a worde is the Image of
mans minde, and representeth it vnto vs, so the Lorde Iesus
is Gods Image, and most liuely representeth vnto vs,
his power, his Godhead, and his wisedome. For whatsoeeuer
is in the Father, shineth in the Sonne. Some other
thinke that the worde héere,Word, for 
                           •
                         thing. is taken for a thing, after the
Hebrew manner of speaking. For the Hebrewes vse (Dabar)
which signifieth a worde for a thing. When Esay the
Prophet asked king Ezechias, what the Babylonians had seene
in his house, he aunswereth thus: They sawe all that was in
my house, Iohaial dabar, there was not a word, that is to say, any
one thing that I shewed not vnto them in my treasures.

The Prophet replyeth, Behold the daies come, that whatsoeuer
is in thine house shall be taken away, and whatsoeuer thy
father haue laid vp in store vnto this day, shal be carried to Babylon,
Ioij vather dabar, ther shall not a word remain saith the
Lord, that is to say, there shall not one thing be left behinde.
The Angel also in S. Luke, when the virgin Mary meruailed
how she shuld coceiue a childe without mans helpe, sayd vnto
her: No word shall be impossible vnto God, y• is, nothing shalbe
impossible for him to do. So that after this vnderstanding, S.
Iohns mening is, that in the beginning ther was a diuine and
heauenly thing with God.

                  How the word and flesh be not both of one nature.
                  If the word and fleshWord & flesh. were both of one nature, séeing that the
word is euery where, why is not the flesh then euery where,
for when it was in earth, then verily it was not in heauen, &
now when it is in heauen, it is not surely in earth. And it is so
sure that it is not in earth, that as concerning it we looke for
him to come from heauen. When as concerning his eternall
word: we beleeue to be with vs in earth. Therefore by your
doctrine (saith Vigelius vnto Eutiches, who defended that the
diuinitie and humanitie in Christ was but one nature) either
the word is conteined in a place with his flesh, or else the flesh
is euery where with his word. For one nature cannot receiue
in it selfe two natures,2. Nature in Christ. and contrary things. But these two
things be diuerse and farre vnlike, that is to say to be conteined
in a place, and to be euery where. Therfore insomuch as
the word is euery where, and the flesh is not euery wher, it appeareth
plainely, that one Christ himselfe hath in him two
natures, and that by his diuine nature he is euery where, and
by his humanitie he is conteined in a place, that he is created
& hath no beginning, that he is subiect to death and cannot dye.
Whereof one he hath by the nature of his word (whereby hee
is God) and the other he hath by the nature of his flesh, wherby
the same God is made man also. Therefore one sonne of
God, the selfe same was made the sonne of man, and hée hath
a beginning by the nature of his flesh, and no beginning by
the nature of his Godhead. He is comprehended in a place, by
the nature of his flesh, and not comprehended by the nature of
his Godhead. He is inferiour to Angells in the nature of his
flesh, and is equall to his Father in the nature of his Godhead:
He died by the nature of his flesh, & died not by the nature of

his Godhead: This is the faith and catholike confession, which

                     Esdras the Priest brought the lawe the booke of Moses,

Esdras opened ye. booke before the congregation of men & womē,
and whosoeuer else had any vnderstanding. And the Leuites
stood with him, so that he read out of the booke, and the Leuites
instructed the people in the lawe, and the people stood in their
place, and they read in the booke of the lawe distinctly, expounding
the sense, & causing them to vnderstand the reading. Héere
it appeareth that the lawfull and holy ministers of the church
of God,Luke. 4. 17 did not onely read the word of God, but also expound
it. And this our Sauiour Christ practised himselfe when he entered
into the Sinagogue at Nazareth, & expounded a certeine
place out of the. 61. Chapter of Esay. And also after his rising
from death, he appeared to the two Disciples which went to
Emaus, expounding to them whatsoeuer was written of him
in the Scriptures, which example (in expounding the word of
God) all the Apostles followed, &c.

but also an inward perfection, that is to say, we are not onely
bound to fulfil the works of the law outwardly in our liuings,
but also inwardly in our hearts, to be most sincere, to loue entirely
aboue all things, and our neighbour as our selfe. But
our nature is so corrupted that no man liuing is able to do the
same, wherefore no man can be iustified by the works of the
lawe.

                  No man is iustified by the déeds of the lawe,Gal. 2. 25 but by y• faith
of Iesus Christ. ¶This S. Paule proueth by the words of the
Prophet Abacucke. 2. 4. A righteous man liueth by faith. If he
liue by any part of workes, then liueth he not by fayth, but
partly by works, and then were Saint Paules probation vnperfect,
which cannot be. With this agréeth Athanasius, prouing
that fayth alonely hath the vertue in him to iustifie before
God. Before man peraduenture they may (saith he) be reckoned
righteous that sticke to the lawe, but not before God.

                      and not of
faith onely. ¶When we reade in S. Paule that we are iustified
through fayth without the workes of the lawe, it is to bée
vnderstood, that through faith whereby we take holde of the
mercy of God, so plentifully declared vnto vs in our Sauiour
Iesus Christ, we are without any demerites or deseruings of
ours, counted iust and righteous before God, so that our sinnes
shall be no more imputed vnto vs. Héere in Saint Iames to be
iustified, is to be declared righteous before men, and that by
good workes, which are infallible witnesses of the true iustifieng
fayth, and therefore he sayth: Shew me thy fayth by thy
déedes. Againe, he bringeth the example of Abraham, of whom
it is written (30. yeares before he offered his sonne Isaac) Abraham
beléeued, & it was reckoned vnto him for righteousnesse.
Gen. 15. 6. wherby we doe euidently sée, that Saint Iames
meaning is, that Abrahams fayth was no idle fayth, but such
faith as made him obedient to God, which thing he did well
declare, when he did so willingly offer his sonne at Gods commaundement.
All that S. Iames goeth about then, is to proue,
that faith cannot be without good works. And as by fayth onely
we are iustified before God, so by good workes procéeding
from a liuely fayth, wée are iustified before men.
                  Heere wée learne also, that where no good workes be, there
is no true iustifieng fayth, but a lyght vnprofitable

beléeue, such as is in diuels: and yet we must beware, that we
ascribe no parte of our iustification before God, vnto our good
works.
Sir. I. Cheeke.
                  
                  Ther can be no good work reckoned to be in any man,Iohn. 5. 29 but in

Marl. fol. 170.
                  
                  Indéede works doe iustifie, taking iustifie to be, to declare
iust: Euen as white haires do make a man olde, because they
be a signe of age. But works doe this before men, & not before
God. Nor they cannot take hold of forgiuenesse of sins & deliuerance
from their deserued condemnation. For then it should
be false that ye Apostle saith, we be iustified fréely by his grace,
for to him that worketh, the reward is imputed vnto him for
a duety, and not vpon grace and fauour. Wherfore the errours
of those men is too grose to deceiue any of them which hath looked
ouer the holy Scriptures neuer so slightly. Nor it doth not
agrée with the sense neither, when they will haue iustifie, to
be as much as to make iust. For works doe not go before
him, that is to bée iustified,

                  How workes are not the causes of felicitie.
                  Works indeed are to be had, but not as causes, wherfore Christ
admonished vs, saieng: When ye haue done al these things, say:

we are vnprofitable seruants, we haue done but ye thing which
we ought to doe. Neither passe we any thing vpon their caueling,
which say, y• therfore we are vnprofitable seruāts, because
our good works being no cōmodity vnto God: forasmuch as God
néedeth none of our good works, but say they, it cānot be denied
but y• we are by good works profitable vnto our selues. Wée
graunt indéed, that it is profitable vnto vs to liue well. But
that vtilitie is not to be attributed vnto our workes, that they
should be the causes of our blessednesse to come. Wee haue nothing
in vs whereby we can make God obstruct or bound vnto
vs. For whatsoeuer we doe, the same doe we wholy owe vnto
God, and a great deale more then we are able to performe.
Wherfore as Christ admonisheth: The Lord giueth not thanks
vnto his seruant, when he hath done his duetie. And if the seruant
by wel doing cannot binde his Lord to giue him thanks,
how shal he binde him to render vnto him great rewards.

according to his works, yet is y• so to be vnderstood, y• if they be
good works, they are for none other cause caled any mās works,
but for that they are wrought in him, namely by the power of
the spirit of God, whereby they are in very déede the workes
of God. S. Austen most truely saith, that God crowneth in vs
his owne gifts, for as touching vs, we deserue nothing but
death.

                  Wo be to all our iustice (saith S. Austen) if it be iudged setting
mercy a part. Therefore this is a christen sentence, worthy
to be beaten in al mens heads: Let not thy left hand know
what ye right hand doth. Let our right hand worke those things
which be good and pleasant vnto God. And in the meane season
let our heartes depend vpon the grace of Gods goodnesse

onely, & not thy left hand write into thy kalender those things
which be somewhat well done by the right hand. Let the note
of our owne good works be in Gods hand, & not in our owne.
Whatsoeuer he doth reward vs, either in this life either in the
life to come, let vs thanke his grace for it, and not our deserts.

afore God by their owne laws and obseruances: I wold
wish that such folks should a little compare the one with the

and how iustly Christ might say, I am a worme & no man,
euery man knoweth that hath read either the. 26. of Mathew,
or the. 14. of S. Marke, how the Iewes did spit in his face, &
did buffet him with fists, & so vilely intreated him, as no man
could be worse: and therefore it is very properly said of the
Prophet
                        •
                      I am a worme and no man. A worme is a vile thing,
in daunger of treading on, and killing with euery mans foot.
No man regardeth it, no man loueth it nor pittieth it, though
he be a right good man. To expresse therefore liuely and properly
the vile reputation of Christ at the time of his passion,Aug. de expo. simbo. ser. 1.
it is verye aptly sayde. Ego sum vermis & non homo, &c. Beside
this, Saint Austen supposeth him to bée called Vermis,
for an higher consideration. Why is Christ called Vermis,
saith he. Because (he aunswereth) he was mortall, he was
borne of the flesh, and begotten without the companieng together
of man and woman in the act of generation. And therefore
he sayth thus: Sicut vermis calefaciente sole de puro limo
formatur, sic spiritu sancto, &c. As the worme is ingendered
of the pure and onely slime or mudde, being made hotte
with the warme Sunne: Euen so the holy Ghost illustrating
and halowing the heart of the virgin: She was conceiued with
childe, without any humane act of ingendering wrought therein:
In consideration whereof, Christ comparing himselfe to a
worme, sayth by Dauid: I am a worme and no man, that is,
I am not conceiued after the manner & fashion of man. Thus
farre Saint Austen.

vpon the most holiest people, which were taken for the spirituall
state & order, as Monkes, Friers & Priests: which through
their hipocrisie haue heaped vnto themselues, money, goods, and
treasures, and haue gotten lands and dominions, for the which
great diuision was among them. And whereas the world shuld
haue learned of them, faith, loue and knowledge, it was nothing
but slaundered, offended, deceiued, seduced and sore hindered by
them, both in faith and in godly liuing & behauiour: both which
were vtterly decayed in these persons, to the great vndoing and
destruction both of body and soule. And thus the swéete honnye
of Christian loue and concord among these Orders, is turned
into bitter wormwood, by the which many soules are destroyed.

               VVORSHIP.
               
                  What is meant by worshipping.
                  BY worshipping, whether it was in the olde Testament or
new, vnderstand the bowing of a mans selfe vpon y• ground,
as we oftentimes, as we knéele in our praiers, boow our selues,
and lye on our armes and hands with our faces to the ground.
Tindale. fol. 11.
                  
                  ¶Whereas the Latin word of worshipping, is of that nature
that it signifieth both to serue and obserue and honour, it is
aptly referred to God: so that all that seruice, obseruation, reuerence
and deuotion, whereby we doe worship God as wel inwardly
in our hearts as outwardly in deede, is called the worship
of God.
Muscul. fol. 351.
                  
                  ¶To worship God is the first precept, euen to beléeue him

to be our God, and to haue no strange Gods in his sight, that is,
to heare the Gospell, to beléeue it with heart, to confesse God
with mouth: which worship Paul laieth it as the foundation of
all righteousnes & saluation, saieng: Nigh is ye word vnto thée,
euen in thy mouth & heart: and this is the word of faith which
we preach. For faith in our hearts iustifieth, and the confession
with our mouth bringeth saluation, &c.

                  Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God,Mat. 4. 10 and him onely shalt
thou serue (saith our Sauiour Iesus Christ). Whervpon it may
be argued thus: Whosoeuer is neither our Lord nor our God,
to him ought we in no wise to giue godly honor, nor yet to worship
him: but neither the Angells nor the dead Saints are our
Lords and Gods, but are ministers of our Lord God, & vnder
him our fellow seruaunts. To them therefore ought we in no
wise to giue godly honour, nor yet to worship them: neither do
we honour and worship Christ, because he is holy & righteous,
or because that he is beloued of God, but because he is true and
naturall God, of one substaunce with the Father and the Holy
ghost.

                  What wrath is in God.
                  BY wrath is vnderstood, not a disturbaunce or perturbation of
mind, for these things can haue no place in God, but as Augustine
hath well interpreted, in his Booke of the Trinitie:
Wrath in God signifieth a iust vengeaunce. And God is saide
to be angry, when he sheweth forth the effects of an angry man,
which are to punish and auenge. So he is said to repent himself
that he had made man, because lyke a man that repenteth himselfe,
he would ouerthrow his worke.

                  How Zachary and his wife are counted
iust in Scripture.
                  SCripture commendeth Zachary and Elizabeth
to be both iust before God,Luke. 1. 
                           •
                        . and to walke in all
the commaundements and iustifications of the
Lord. To this (saith Master Fox) I could aunswere
thus: y• if Zachary & Elizabeth his wife,
were both iust before God, it was not because
God could not, but because he would not finde fault with them.
But to let mine owne aunswere goe, I will set S. Hierome to
aunswere therevnto, where he declareth two manner of perfections
to be in holy Scriptures. One which is agréeable to the
vertues of God, and is voide of all sinne and immutable. And
this (saith he) is appropriate onely to God, & was héere declared
in Christ: The other which agreeth to our fragilitie, and is not
pure from all sinne, and is called perfect, not by comparison to
Gods iustice, but so accounted in the knowledge of God, who
séeth the good indeuour of ye fraile creature, & accepteth ye same:
& in the same, produceth this example both of Zachary & Elizabeth,
& also of Iob. The like answere may be gathered out of S.
Austen, who speaking of the worthinesse which is in iust men
heere, saith, y• it may be called perfect, so far as they both truly acknowledge
& humbly confesse their own imperfection going wt
                     all,
&c. So y• of the righteousnes of Zachary, we may say as S.
Paule said by ye righteousnes of Abraham: y• if he haue any thing
to glory, he hath to glory with men & not wt god, in whose iudgment
(saith Dauid) no flesh shalbe iustified, &c. only y• flesh of the
sonne of God excepted, who onely being iust died for y• vniust,
as Saint Peter witnesseth, wherevpon I ground this reason:
Christ dyed for the vniust: Zachary and Elizabeth were not

vniust before God (as they say) Ergo Christ died not for them,
which is absurd to graunt: so that rather this argument is to
be holden, A sensu contrario: Christ dyed for the vniust: Christ
dyed for Zachary and Elizabeth: Ergo Zachary and Elizabeth
were vniust. Againe, They that doe the commaundements doe
liue therein: Zachary and Elizabeth lyued not in the commandements
but died: Ergo, Zachary and Elizabeth did not all the
commaundements so iustly as they should.
Master Fox
in his sermon of Christ crucified. fo. 36.
                  
                  ¶They were both righteous before God, & walked in all the
lawes & ordinaunces of the Lord without reproch. These words
are not to be vnderstood as though Zachary & Elizabeth absolutely
fulfilled the law, for then they had no néed of Christ, and
Christ had not then said truly in ye 17. of Luke: Dicite, &c. Say
ye, we are vnprofitable seruants, &c. But therfore they are said
to be iust, because God in Christ imputed not to them their sins,
for they were not without their faults. And Dauid is true, who
saith. Psa. 14. Omnes declinauerunt: They are all gone out of the
way, they are altogether become abhominable, there is no man
that doth good, no not one. And in this number I am sure, are also
comprehended both Zachary & Elizabeth. And the same Prophet
in the 142. Psa. hath thus: Non intres: Enter not into iudgment
with thy seruant O Lord, for no man liuing shalbe iustified
in thy sight. And it is to be supposed, that in these words the
Prophet meant not onely such as liued in his time, but also in
times both past, then present & to come.

                  How this place of Zachary, confirmeth Priests mariage.
                  A certaine Priest named Zacharias of the course of Abia.
                     Luke. 1. 5. 
                     Zachary
was a Priest & walked in all the precepts and commandements
of God without blame, & yet he had a wife. Therfore
wiues do not let, but that we may both please and serue God in
this our ministerie.

               ZEALE.
               
                  A definition of this word zeale.
                  ZEale, is an affection, which consisteth in that part of ye mind
which lusteth or desireth, after which by reason of the vehemencie
foloweth griefe, both because of y• felowship of others,
and also for the want of the thing which is desired.
