               iercely smote him with his venemous

tayle, that downe fell man and horse, in which fall two of Saint Georges ribs were sore brused, but yet stepping backward, it was his chaunce to leape vnder an Orringe trée, which trée had such pretious vertue, that no venemous worme durst come within the compasse of the braunches, nor within seauen foote thereof, where this valiant Knight rested himselfe vntill he had recouered his former strength: who no sooner féeling his spirits reuiued, but with an eger courage smote the burning Dragon vnder his yellow burnisht bellie with his trustie sworde Askalon, whereout came such abundance of venome, that it sprinkled vpon the Champions Armour, whereby immediatly through the impoysoned strength of the venome his Armour burst in twaine, and the good Knight fell into a gréeuous and dead sound, that for a time he lay breathles: but yet hauing that good memorie remayning, that he tumbled vnder the branches of the Orringe trée; in which place the Dragon could proffer him no further violence. The fruit of the trée was of such an excellent vertue, that whosoeuer tasted thereof should presently bee cured of all manner of diseases and infirmities whatsoeuer: So it was the Noble Champions good and happie fortune, a little to recouer through the vertue of the trée, and to espie an Orringe which a little before had dropped downe wherwith he so refreshed himselfe, that hee was in short time as sound as when hee first began the incounter: Then knéeled hee downe and made his diuine supplication to heauen, that God would send him (for his deare sonnes sake) such strength and agillity of body as to slay the furious and tirrable monster, which béeing done, with a bold and couragious heart, hee smote the Dragon vnder the wing, where it was tender without scale, wherby his good sworde Askalon with an easie passage went to the verie hilts through both the Dragons heart, liuer, bone and blood, whereout issued such aboundance of purple gore, that it turned the grasse which grewe in the valley into a crimson colour, & the ground which before partched through

the burning stinch of the Dragon, was now drenched with ouermuch moysture which voyded from his venemous bowels, where at last through want of blood, and long continuance in fight, the Dragon yéelded his vitall spirits to the mercy of the conquering Champion. The which béeing happely performed, the Noble Knight Saint George of England, first yéelding due honour to Almighty God for the victorie, then with his good sword Askalon he cut off the Dragons head and pitcht it vpon the trunchion of a speare, which at the beginning of the battaile hee shiuered against the Dragons scalie backe: During this long and dangerous Combat, his trustie Stéede lay altogether in a sounde without any moouing, which caused the English Champion with all spéed to crush the ioyce of an Orringe into hys cold mouth: the vertue whereof, presently expelled the venemous poysons, and recouered his former strength againe.
            There was as then remayning in the Egiptian Court, one Almidor the blacke King of Moroco, who long had prosecuted (in the way of marriage) the Loue of Sabra the Kinges daughter, but by no pollicie, meanes, nor manhood, could hée accomplish what his har

With al my soule (answered the Egiptian Lady) will I forsake my country Gods, & for thy loue become a Christian, and therewithall she burst a ring in twaine, the one halfe she gaue to him in pledge of Loue, & kept the other halfe her selfe: and so for that time departed the Garden.

               IT was at that time of the yeare, when the earth was newly deckt with a summers liuerie, when the Noble and Heroicall minded Champion Saint Anthonie of Italie ariued in Thrasia, where he
                  •

                  •
               e mountaine, wheron stood a woonderfull huge and strong Castell, which was kept by the most mightiest Giant vnder the cope of heauen, whose puissant force all Thrasia could not ouercome, nor once attempt to withstand, but with the danger of their whole countrie. The Giants name was Blanderon, hys Castell of the purest Marble stone, his gates of yellowe Brasse, and ouer the principall gate was graued in Letters of gold these verses following.
            
               Within this Castell, liues the scourge of Kinges,
               A furious Giant, whose vnconquered power:
               
                  The Thracian Monarke to subiection bringes,
               And keepes his Daughters prisoners in his Tower.
               Seauen Damsels faire the monstrous Giant keepes,
               That singes him Musicke while he rightly sleepes.
            
            
               His bats of steele a thousand Knights hath felt,
               Which for these virgins sakes haue lost their liues:
               For all the Champions bold that with him dealt,
               This most intestiue Giant still suruiues,
               Let simple passengers take heede in time,
               When vp this steepie mountaine they do clime.
            
            
               But Knights of worth, and men of Noble minde,
               If any chaunce to trauaile by this Tower:
               That for these Maidens sakes will be so kinde,
               To trie their strengthes against the Giants power:
               Shall haue a virgins praier both day and night,
               To prosper them with good successefull fight.
            
            After he had read what was written ouer the gate, desire of Fame so incouraged him, and the thirst of honour so imboldned his valiant minde, that he eyther vowed to redeeme the Ladies from their seruitude, or die with honour by the furie of the Giant: So going to the Castell gate, he stroke so vehemently thereon with the pummell of hys sword, that it sounded like a mightie thunder clap: Wherat Blanderon sodainely started vp, béeing fast a sléepe close by a Fountaines side, and came pacing foorth at the Gate with a mightie Oake vppon his necke: which at the fight of the Italian Champion, so lightly flourished it about hys head, as though it had béene but a light Dimmilaunce, and with these wordes gaue the Noble Champion entertainement

            Thus boasted the vaine glorious Gyant vpon his owne strength: During which time, the valerous and hardie Champion had alighted from his horse: where after hee had made hys humble supplication to the heauens for hys good sp

               ede, and committed his Fortune to the impartiall Quéene of destenie, hee approached within the compasse of the Giants reach, who with his great Oake so nimbly besturde him with such vehement blowes, that they séemed to shake the earth, and to rattle against the walles of the Castell like mighty thunder claps, and had not the polliticke Knight continually skipped from the furie of his blow, hee had béene brused as small as flesh vnto the potte, for euerie stroke that the Giant gaue, the roote of hys Oake entered at the least two or thrée foote déepe into the ground
                  •
               . But such was the wisedome and pollicie of the worthie Champion, not to withstand the force of his weapon, till the Giant grew breathles, and not able through his long labour to lift the Oake aboue his head, and likewise the heate of the Sunne was so intollerable, (by reason of the extreame haight of the Mountaine, and the mightie waight o

into hys Castell; but that the Italian Champion with a bold courage assailed the Giant so fiercely, that he was forced to let his Oake fall, and stand gasping for breath, which when the noble Knight beheld, with a fresh supplie hee redoubled his blowes so couragiously, that they battered on the Giants Armour like a storme of winters ha

Anthonie the Champion of Italie: But by that time the long and dangerous encounter was finished, and the Giant Blanderons head disseuered from his bodie, the Sunne sate mounted on the highest part of the Elements, which caused the day to be extreame hote and sulthie, whereby the Champions Armour so extreamely scalded him, that hee was constrained to vnbrace his Corslet, and to lay aside his Burgonet, and to cast his body on the cold earth, onely to mittiga

            During which time faire Rossalinde (one of the Daughters of the Thracian Kinges, beeing as then Prisoner in the Castell,) by chaunce looked ouer the walles, and espied the bodie of the Giant headles, vnder whose subiection shée had continued

in great seruitude for the time of seauen monthes, likewise by him a Knight vnarmed, as she thought panting for breath, the which the Ladie Iudged to bee the Knight that had slaine the Giant Blanderon, & the man by whome her deliuerie should be recouered, she presently descended the walles of the Castell, and ran with all speed to the aduenterous Champion, whome she found dead: But yet béeing nothing discouraged of his recouerie, féeling as yet a warme blood in euerie member, retired backe with all spéede to the Castell, and fetcht a box of pretious Balme, the which the Giant was wont to poure into hys woundes after his encounter with any knight: with which Balme this curteous Ladie chafed euerie part of the breathles Champions bodie, one while washing his stiffe limbes with her salt teares, the which like pearles fell from her eyes, another while drying them with the tresses of her golden haire, which hung dangling in the winde, then chafing hys li

fire against his vprising, where after he had refreshed hys wearie spirites with a a daintie banket, & caroused downe two or thrée bowles of Greekish Wines, hee after by the counsell of Rossalinde, stripped the Giant from hys Iron furniture, and lest his naked bodie vpon a craggie Rocke to bée deuoured of hungrie Rauens: which béeing done the Thracian Uirgin discouered all the secrets of the Castell to the aduenterous Champion: First shee led him to a leaden Tower, where hung a hundred well approoued Corslets, with other Martiall furniture, which were the spoyles of such Knights as he had violently slaine, after that shee brought him to a stable, wherein stoode a hundred pampered Iades, which daylie fed vpon nothing but humane flesh: Against it was directly placed the Gyants owne lodging, his bed was of Iron, corded with mightie bars of stéele, the testerne and couering of carued brasse, the curtaines were of leaues of gold, and the rest of a straunge and wonderfull substance of the colour of the Elements: after this shee led him to a broad pond of water, more clearer than quicksiluer, the streames wherof lay continually as smooth as Christall Ice, whereon swam six mike white Swans with Crownes of gold about their neckes.
            O here saide the Thracian Lady, begins the hell of al my griefe! At which wordes a pearled shower of teares ran from the Conduits of her eyes, that for a time they staide the passage of her tongue, but hauing discharged her heart from a few sorrowfull sighes, she began in this manner to tell her passed fortunes.

            The King my Father ordayned a solemne hunting to be holden through the land, in which Honourable pastime,

my selfe in companie of my sixe sisters were present:

            Thus haue you heard (most Noble Knight) the true discourse of my most vnhappy fortunes, and the wonderfull

transformation of my sixe sisters, whose losse to this day is greatly lamented throughout all Thrace, and with that word she made an end of her Tragicall discourse, not able to vtter the rest for weeping: whereat the Knight being oppressed then with like sorrow, imbraced her about the slender waste, and thus ki
                  •

            My most deare and kinde Ladie, within whose countenance, I see how vertue is inthronized, and in whose minde liues true Magnanimitie, let these few wordes suffice to comfort thy sorrowfull cogitations: First thinke that the Heauens are most beneficiall vnto thée in preseruing thy chastity from the Giants insatiate desires, then for thy deliuerie by my meanes from thy slauish seruitude: Thirdly and lastly, that thou remaining in thy naturall shape & likenes, mayest liue to bee the meanes of thy sisters transformations: Therefore drie vp those Cristall pearled teares, and b

who in this manner expressed the truth of the matter vnto them.
            Faire Ladie, and most renowned Knight, (said the Porter) for so you séeme both by your speeches and Honourable demaundes, the cause of this ringing is for the losse of the Kinges seauen daughters, the number of which Belles be seauen, called after the name of the seauen Princes, which neuer yet hath ceased their dolefull melodie, since the departure of the vnhappie Ladies, nor neuer must vntill ioyfull newes be heard of their safe returne.

            CHAP. VII. 
            
               How Saint Andrew the Champion of Scotland trauailed into a vale of walking Spirites, and how hee was set at libertie, by a going fire. After his iournie into Thracia, where he recouered the six Ladies to their naturall shapes, that had liued seauen yeares in the likenes of milk-white Swannes, with other accidents that befell the most Noble Champion.
            
            
               NOW of the Honourable aduentures of Saint Andrew the famous Champion of Scotland must I discourse, whose seauen yeares trauailes were as straunge as any of the other Champions: For after hee had departed from the Brazen Piller, as you heard in the beginning of the Historie. He trauailed through many a strange and vnknowne Nation, beyond the cercuit of the sunne, where but one time in the yere she shews her brightsome beames, but continually darkenes ouerspreads the countrie, & there is a kind of people that haue heads like dogs, & in the extreamity of hunger doe deuoure one another: from which people this Noble Champion was woonderfull strangelie

deliuered, or after he had wandred some certain dayes, neither seeing

               bbes, roring of spirits, and such like horrible hearinges, that it made the Scottish Champion almost at hys wits end: But yet hauing an vndaunted courage, exempting all feare, he humblie made his supplcation to heauen, that God woulde deliuer him from that discontented place of terrour: and so presently as the Champion knéeled vpon the barren ground (wheron grew neyther hearbe, flower, grasse, nor any other gréene thing,) he beheld a certaine flame of fire walking vp and downe before him, whereat he grew into such an extasie of feare, that he stood for a time amazed whether it were best to goe forward, or to stand still: But yet recalling his sences, he remembred himselfe, howe hee had read in passed times of a going fire called Ignis fatuis, the fire of destenie, or some Will with the wispe, or Will with the lanthorne, & likewise by some simple countrie people, the faire maide of Ireland, which commonly vsed to lead wandring trauailers out of their wayes. The like imagination entered the Champions minde: So encouraging himselfe with hys owne conceits, and chearing vp his dull sences late oppressed with exstreame feare, he directly followed the going fire which so iustly went before him, that by the time the guider of the night had climbed twelue degrées in the zodiacke, hee was safelie deliuered from the vale of walking spirits, by the direction of the going fire.
            Now began the Sunne to daunce about the firmament, which he had not séene in many monthes before: whereat hys dull sences so much reioyced, beeing so long 
                  •
               ouered before with darkenes, that euerie step he troad was as pleasurable,

as though he had walked in a garden bedeckt with all kinde of fragrant flowers.
            At last without any further molestation he ariued within the territories of Thracia, a countrie as you heard in the former Chapter, adorned with the beautie of many faire Woodes and Forrestes, through which bee trauailed with small rest, but lesse sléepe, till hee came to the foote of the mountaine, wherevpon stoode the Castell wherein the wofull King of Thrace in companie of hys sorrowfull subiects, still lamented the vnhappie destenies of hys six daughters turnde into Swannes, with Crownes of gold about their neckes: But when the valiant Champion Saint Andrew beheld the loftie scittuation of the Castell, and the inuincible strength it séemed to be of, expected some straunge aduenture to befall him in the said Castell: So preparing his sword in readines, and buckling close hys Armour, which was a shirt of siluer maile for lightnes in trauaile: Hée climbed the Mountaine, wherevpon he espied the Giant lying vpon a craggie Rocke, with limbes and members all to be rent and torne, by the furie of hunger starued foules: which loathsome spectakle was no little woonder to the worthie Champion, considering the mightie stature & bignes of the Giant: So leauing his putrified bodie to the windes, he approached the gates: where after he had read the superscription ouer the same, without any interruption entred the Castle where hee expected a fierce encounter by some Knight that should haue defended the same, but all things fell out contrary to his imagination, for after he had found many a straunge nouelty and hidden secrete closed in the same, chaunced at last to come where the Thracians duly obserued their ceremonious mournings, which in this order was dayly performed: for vppon sondayes which in that Country is the first day in the wéeke, all the Thracians attyred themselues after the manner of Bacchus Priestes, and burned perfumed incence and sweete Arabian francumsence vpon a religious shrine which they offered to the

as chiefe gouernour of that day, thinking thereby to appease the angrie destenies, and so recouer the vnhappie Ladies to their former shapes: vpon Mundaies clad in garments after the manner of Syluanes, & colour like to the waues of the sea, they offered vp their wofull teares to the Moone, beeing the g

                  •
               sdayes like Souldiers trayling their Banners on the dust, and Drums sounding sad and dolefull melody in signe of discontent, they committed their proceedings to the pleasure of Mars, beeing ruler and guider of that day: vppon Wensday like schollers vnto Mercurie: vppon Thursday like Potentates to Ioue: vpon Fridayes like louers with sweet sounding Musicke to Venus: and vpon Saterdaies like Manuall professors to the angry and discontented Saturne.
            
            Thus the wofull Thracian King with his sorowful subiects, consumed seauen months away, one while accusing fortune of dispite, another while the heauens of iniustice: the one for Childrens transformations, the other for their long limited punishments: But at last when the Scottish Champion heard what bitter mone the Thracians made about the riuer, he demaunded the cause, and to what purpose they obserued such vaine ceremonies, contemning the Maiestie of high Iehoua, and only worshipping but outward & vaine Gods: to whome the King after a few sadde teares strained from the Conduits of his aged eies replied in this manner.
            Most noble Knight for so you seeme, both by your gesture and other outward appearance, (quoth the King,) if you desire to know the cause of our continuall griefe, prepare your eares to heare a tragicke and wofull tale, whereat I sée the elements begin to mourne, and couer their azurde countenance, with sable cloudes.

with purple gore, and theyr eyes (within whose cleare glasses one might behold the God of loue dancing) all to be rent & torne by the fury of the bryers, whereby they could not sée the light of heauen, nor the place of theyr vnfortunate abyding: which wofull spectacle forced such a terror in the heart of the Irish Knight, that he presently made out for the rescue of the Ladies, against the bloody fury of the mercilesse Satyrs which were in number about some thirty, euery one hauing a mighty clubbe vpon his necke, which they had made with roots of yong Oakes and Pine trées, yet this aduenterous Champion being nothing discouraged, but with a bold and resolute minde he let driue at the sturdiest Satyr, whose Armour of defence was made of a Buls hide, which was dryed so hard against the Sunne, that the Champions Curtle-axe little preuayled: after which the fell Satyrs incompassed the Christian Knight round about, and so mightely opprest him with downe right blowes, that had he not by good fortune leapt vnder the boughes of a mighty trée, his life had béene forst to giue the world a spéedy farewell: But such was his nimblenes and actiue pollicy, that

            Know braue minded Knight, that wee are the vnfortunate Daughters of the King of Thrace, whose liues hath béene vnhappie euer since our creations: For first wee did indure a long imprisonment vnder the handes of a cruell Giant, and after the heauens to preserue our Chasteties from the wicked desires of the said Gyant, transformed vs into the shape of Swans, in which likenes we remayned seauen yeares, but at last recouered by a worthy Christian Knight, named S. Andrew the Champion of Scotland, after whom we haue trauailed many a wery step, neuer crost by any violence, vntill it was our angry fates to ariue in this vnhappy Wildernes, where your eyes haue béene true witnesses of our wofull misfortunes: Which sad discourse béeing no sooner finished, but the worthy Champion began thus to comfort the distressed Ladyes.
            The Christian Champion after whom you take in hand this wearie trauaile (said the Irish Champion) is my approoued friend, for whose companie and wished sight, I wil goe more weary miles, than there be trées in this accursed Wildernes, and number my steppes with the multitude of sands hidden in the seas: therefore most excellent Ladies, true ornaments of beautie, bee sad companions in my trauailes, for I will neuer cease til I haue found our honorable friend the Champion of Scotland, or some of those braue Knightes whome I haue not séene these seauen Sommers.

               How Saint Dauid the Champion of Wales slewe the Countie Palatine in the Tartarian Court, and after howe hee was sent to the Inchaunted Garden of Ormondine, wherein by Magicke Art he slept seauen yeares.
            
            
               
                  SAint Dauid the most Noble Champion of Wales, after his departure from the brazen piller where as the other Champions of Christendome deuided themselues seuerally, to séeke for forraine aduentures, he atchiued many memorable thinges, as well in Christendome, as in those Nations that acknowledge no true God: which for this time I omit, and only discourse what hapned vnto him amongst the Tartarians: For béeing in the Emperour of Tartaries Court (a place very much honoured with valerous Knights, and highlie grac
                  •
               e with a trayne of beauteous Ladies) where the Emperour vpon a time ordayned a

solemne Ioust and Turnament to be holden in the honour of hys birth day: whether resorted at the time appointed, (from all the borders of Tartarie) the best and hardiest Knights there remayning: In which honorable & Princely exercise, the Noble Knight Saint Dauid was appointed Champion for the Emperour, who was mounted vppon a Moroco Steede, betrapped in a rich Caparison, wrought by the curious workmanship of the Indian women, vppon whose shield was set a golden Griffon rampant in a fielde of blew.
            Against him came the Countie Palatine, Sonne & heire aparant to the Tartarian Emperour, brought in by twelue Knights, richly furnished with all habilliments of honour, and paced thrée times about the Lists, before the Emperor and many Ladies that were present to behold the honourable Turnament: The which béeing done, the twelue Knights departed the Lists, and the Countie Palatine prepared himselfe to encounter with the Christian Knight: being then appointed chiefe Champion for the day: who likewise locked downe his Beuer, and at the Trumpets sound by the Harrolds appointment, ran so fiercely one against the other, that the ground seemed to thunder vnder them, & the skies to resounde ecchoes of their mighty strokes.
            At the second race the Champions ran, Saint Dauid had the worse, & was constrained through the forcible strength of the Countie Palatine, to fall backwarde almost beside hys saddle: whereat the Trumpets began to sound in signe of victorie: but yet the valiant Christian nothing dismayed, but with a courage (within whose eyes saie Knightlie reuenge) ran the third time against the County Palatine, and by the violent force of hys strength, he ouerthrew both horse & man, wherby the Counties body was so exstreamly brused with the fall of hys horse, that hys heart blood issued foorth from hys nostrels, and hys vitall spirits pressed from the mancion of hys breast, that he was forced to giue the world a timeles farewell.
            
               This fatall ouerthrow of the Countie Palatine, abashed the whole company: but especially the Tartarian Emperour, who hauing no more sonnes but him, caused the Lists to be broken vp, the Knights to be vnarmed, and the murthered Countie to bee brought by foure Squiers into hys Pallace: where after he was dispoyled of hys furniture, & the Christian Knight receaued it in the honour of hys victorie. The wofull Emperour bathed the Tartarians bodie with teares which dropped like Christall Pearles vpon his congealed blood, where after many sadde sighs hee breathed forth this wofull lamentation.
            Now are my triumphs turnd to euerlasting woes, from a commicall pastime, to a dierefull and bloody tragedy: O most vnkinde fortune, neuer constant but in change! Why is my life deferde to sée the downefall of my deare Son, the Noble County Palatine? why rends not this accursed earth whereon I stand, and presently swallow vp my body into her hungrie bowels: Is this the vse of Christians for true Honour, to repay dishonour, could no bace blood serue to staine hys deadly handes withall, but with the precious blood of my deare Sonne, in whose reuenge the face of the heauens is stained with blood, and cryes for vengeaunce to the Maiesty of high eternall Ioue, the dreadfull furies, the direfull daughters of darke night, and all the balefull companie of burning Acharon, whose loynes be girt with Serpents, and haire be hangde with wreathes of Snakes▪ shall haunt, pursue and followe tha

            Thus sorrowed the wofull Emperour for the death of his Noble sonne: sometimes making the ecchoes of his lamentations pearce the elements: another while forcing his bitter curses to sinke to the déepe foundation of Acharon: one while intending to bée reuenged vpon Saint Dauid the

Christian Champion, then presently his intent was crost with a contrary imagination, that it was against the Lawe of Armes, and a great dishonour to his Country, by violence to oppresse a strange Knight, whose actions hath euer béene guided by true honour, but yet at last this firme resolution entred into his minde.
            There was adioyning vppon the borders of Tartary, an inchaunted garden kept by Magicke art, from whence neuer any returned that attempted to enter; the Gouernour of which garden was a notable and famous Nigromancer named Ormondine, to which Magitian the Tartarian Emperour intended to sende the aduenterous Champion saint Dauid, thereby to reuenge the County Pallatines death: So the Emperour after some fewe dayes passed▪ and the Obsequies of his sonne being no sooner perfourmed▪ but he caused the Christian Knight to be brought into his presente, to whom he committed this heauy taske and weary labour. Proude Knight (sayd the angry Emperour) thou knowest since thy ariuall into our Territories howe highly I haue honoured thee, not onely ingraunting liberty of life, 
                  〈◊〉
                making thée chiefe Champion of Tartarie, which high honour thou haste repaide with great ingratitude, and blemished true Nobilitie, in acting of my deare sonnes Tragedy: For which vnhappie déede thou rightly haste deserued death: But yet know accursed Christian, that mercie harboureth in a Princely minde, and where honour sits inthronize
                  •
               , there Iustice is not too seuere. Although thou hast deserued death: yet if thou wilt aduenture to the Inchaunted garden, and bring hether the Magitians head, I graunt thée not only thy life, but therewithall the Crowne of Tartarie after my discease: because I sée then haste a minde furnished with all Princely thoughtes, and adornde with true Magnanimitie.
            This heauie taske, and strange aduenture, not a little pleased the Noble Champion of Wales, whose minde euer thirsted after straunge aduentures: and so after some

considerate thoughts, in this manner he replied.
            Most high and magnificent Emperour (said the Champion) were this taske which you inioyne me to, as wonderfull as the labors of Hercules, or as fearefull as the interprise which Iason made for the golden

            Thus this valiant Christian Champion, being bounde to a heauie taske, within thrée dayes prepares all necessaries in readines for hys departure: and so trauailed westward, till he approach to the sight of the Inchaunted Garden, the scittuation whereof somewhat daunted his valiant courage: for it was incompassed with a hedge of withered thornes, and briers, which séemed continually to burne: vpon the toppe thereof, sate a number of straunge and deformed thinges, some in the likenes of night Owles, that woondered at the presence of Saint Dauid: some in the shape of Progines transformation, foretelling hys infortunate successe: and some like Rauens, that with their harsh throuts ring foorth a balefull knell of some wofull Tragedie: the elements which couered the Inchaunted Garden, séemed to bee

               , or rather the very patterne of hell, stroke such a terror into the Champions hart, that twice he was in minde to returne without performing the aduenture; but for hys oath and

Honor of Knighthood, which he had pawnde for the accomplishment thereof: So laping hys body on the bare earth, beeing the first nurse and mother of his life, her made hys humble petition to God, that hys minde might be neuer opprest with cowardize, nor his heart daunted with any faint feare, till he had performed what the Tartarian Emperour had bound him to, the Champion rose from the ground, and with chearefull lookes beheld the elements, which seemed at hys conceit to smile at the enterprise, and to foreshew a luckie euent.
            So the Noble Knight Saint Dauid with a valiant courage went to the Garden gate, by which stoode a Rocke of stone, ouerspread with mosse: In which Rock by Magicke Art was inclosed a sworde, nothing outwardly appearing but the h

            These verses draue such a conceited Imagination into the Champions minde, that hee supposed himselfe to bée the Northen Knight, by whome the Nigromancer should bée conquered: Therefore without anye further aduisement he put hys hand into the hilt of the rich swor

            But at last when seauen yeares were fully ended, it was

the Champions luckie fortune to finde in a secret corner of the dungeon, a certaine Iron Engin, which time had almost cōsumed with rust: wherwith by long labor, he digged himselfe a passage vnder the ground, till he ascended iust in the middle of the Soldans Court, which was at that time of the night when all thinges were silent: the heauens hée then beheld beautified with stats, & bright Cinthia, whose glistering beames he had not séene in many a hūdred nights before séemed to smile at hys safe deliuerie, and to stay her wandring course till the noble English Champion found

            These wordes so abashed the Lady, that shee went with all speed from the Tower, and told the Gyant how a Christian Knight remayned at hys Gate, that had sworne to suffice hys hunger in dispite of hys will: whereat the furious Gyant sodainely started vp, béeing as then in a sound sléepe, for it was at the middle of the day: who tooke a bat of Iron in hys hand, and came downe to the Tower Gate: his stature was in haight fiue yeardes: hys heade brisled like a Bores, a foote there was betwixt each brow, his eies hollow, hys mouth wide, hys lippes were like two flaps of steele, in all proportion more like a diuell than a man: Which deformed monster so daunted the courage of Saint George, that he prepared himselfe to death: not through feare of the monstrous Gyant, but for hunger and féeblenes of body: but God so prouided for him, and so restored the Champions decayed strength, that hee indured battaile till the closing vp of the Euening, by which time the Gyant was almost blinde, through the sweate that ran down

spirits neuer entertained longer rest, but to the refreshing of himselfe and hys horse: So trauailed he through the parts of Grecia, the confines of Phrigia, and so into the borders of Tartarie, within whose Territories he had not long iournied, but he approached the sight of the Inchaunted Garden of Ormondine, where S. Dauid the Champion of Wales had so long slept by Magicke Art. No sooner did he behold the woonderfull scituation thereof, but hee espied Ormondines sword inclosed in the Inchaunted Rocke: where after he had read the superscription written about the pummell, he assaied to pull it out by strength: where he no sooner put hys hand into the hilt, but he drew it forth with much ease, as though it had béene hung but by a thred of vntwisted silke: but when hee beheld the glistring, brightnesse of the blade, and the wonderfull richnes of the pummell, hee accounted ye prize more worth than the Armour of Achilles, which caused Aiax to runne mad, and more richer than Medeas golden Fléece: But by that time Saint George had circumspectly lookt into euerie secret of the sword, he heard a straunge and dismall voice thunder in the skyes, a tyrrible & mighty lumbring in the earth, whereat both hils & mountaines shooke, Rockes remooued, and huge Oakes rent into péeces: After this the Gates of the Inchaunted Garden flew open, whereat incontinently came foorth Ormondine the Magitian, with hys haire staring on hys head, hys eyes sparckling, hys chéekes blushing, hys hands quiuering hys legs trembling, and all the rest of hys body distempered, as though legions of spirits had incompast him about: he came directly to the worthy English knight that remayned still by the Inchaunted Rock
                  •
               , from whence hee had pulled the Magitians sword, where after the Nigromancer had sufficiently beheld hys Princely countenance, whereon true honour sate inthronized, and viewed hys portly personage, the Image of true Knighthood, the which séemed in the Magitians eyes, to be the rarest work that euer nature framed: First taking the most valiant and magnanimious

Champion Saint George of England by the steélie Gauntlet, and with great humilitie kissed it, then proffering him the curtesies due vnto strangers, which was perfourmed verie graciously: hee after conducted him into the Inchaunted Garden, to the Caue where the Champion of Wales was kept sléeping by the foure virgins delightfull songes, and after setting him in a chaire of Ebonie, Ormondine thus began to relate of wonderfull things.
            Renowned Knight at Armes (saide the Nigromancer) Fames worthiest Champion, whose straunge aduentures, all Christendome in time to come shall applaude: therfore be silent till I haue told my Tragicke tale, for neuer after this my tongue shall speake againe: The Knight which thou seest here wrapped in this sheete of gold, is a Christian Champion as thou art, sprung from the auncient feede of Troian warriours, who likewise attempted to drawe this Inchaunted sword, but my Magicke spels so preuailed, that he was intercepted in the enterprise, and forced euer since to remaine sléeping in this Caue: but now the houre is almost come of hys recouery, which by thée must be accomplished: thou art that aduenterous Champion, whose inuincible hand must finish vp my detested life, and send my fléeting soule to draw the fatall Charriot vppon the banckes of burning Acharon: for my time was limited to remaine no longer in this Inchaunted Garden, but vntill that from the North should come a Knight that should pull this sword from the Inchaunted Rocke, which thou happilie hast now perfourmed: therefore I know my time is short, & my houre of destenie is at hand: what I report write it vp in brazen lines, for the time will come when thys discourse shall highly benefit thee. Take héed thou obserue thrée thinges: first that thou take to wise a pure maide: next that thou erect a Monument ouer thy Fathers graue, and lastly that thou continue a professed foe to the enemies of Christe Iesus, hearing Armes in the Honour and praise of thy Countrie. These thinges beeing truely and iustly obserued, thou

shalt attaine to such honour, that all the Kingdomes of Christendome shall admire thy dignitie▪ What I speake is vppon no vaine imagination sprung from a franticke braine, but pronounced by the misticall and déepe Art of Nigromancie.
            These words being no sooner ended, but the most honoured and fortunate Champion of England requested the Magitian to describe his passed fortunes, & by what meanes he came first to be gouernour of that inchaunted garden.

                           This Floridon so feruently burned in affection, with the admired Castria, that he lusted after virginitie, and practised both by pollicie and faire promises to enioy that precious pleasure, which after

                        What knowes not Floridon (quoth the Lady) her whom hys lust hath stained with dishonour? See sée vnconstant Knight the pledge of faithles vowes, beholde the wombe where springes thy liuely image, behold the marke which staines my Fathers auncient house, and sets a shamefaste blush vpon my chéekes.

                        At which wordes Floridon with a wrathfull countenance, replyed in these wordes. Egregious and shameles creature (quoth he) with what brazen face darest thou out braue mee thus: I tell thee Castria, my loue was euer yet to follow Armes, to heare the sound of Drummes, to ride vppon a nimble Stéede, and not to trace a carpet daunce, like Priams sonne before the lustfull eyes of Maenalaus wife: Therefore begone disturbing strumpet, goe sing thy harsh melodie in company of nightly birdes, for I tell thée the day will blushe to couer thy monstrous shame.

            Thus euery thing prepared in readines fitting so great a Royaltie: the Princes and Ladies placed in theyr seates: the Emperour with his new married Empresse inuested on theyr loftie throanes strongly garded with a hundred Armed Knights, the Kings Harrolds solemely proclaimed the Turnaments, which in this most Royall manner began.
            The first day Saint Dennis of Fraunce was appointed chiefe Champion against all commers, who was called by the title of the golden Knight, who at the sounde of the Trumpet entered the Lists: hys Tent was of the colour of the Marigold, vpon the top an artificiall Sunne framed, that séemed to beautefie the whole assemblie: hys Horse of an Iron Gray, gra

            Thus in great Royaltie to the excéeding pleasure of the Emperour, was the first day spent, till the darke Euening caused the Knights to breake off company, and repaire to their nights repose: But the next Morning no sooner did Phoebus shewe his splendant brightnesse, but the King of Harrolds vnder the Emperour, with a noyse of Trumpets awaked the Champions from their silent sléepe, who with all spéede prepared for the second dayes exercise. The chiefe Champion appointed for that day, was the victorious Knight saint Iames of Spaine: which (after the Emperor with hys Empresse had seated themselues with a statelie traine of beautifull Ladies) entred the Listes vpon a Spanish Gennet betrapt with rich Caparison, his Tent was pitcht directly ouer against the Emperors Throane, which was of the colour of quick-siluer, whereon was portrayed many excellent deuices: before the Tent attended foure Squiers, bearing foure seuerall scutchions in their hands, whereon were curiously paynted the foure Elements: likewise he had the tytle of the siluer Knight, who behaued himselfe no lesse worthy of all Princely commendations, than the French Champion the day before: The third day saint Anthony of Italy was chiefe challenger in the Turnanament▪ whose Tent was of the colour of the Skyes, his Stéede furnished with costly Habilliments: his Armour after the Barbarian manner, his shield plated round about with stéele, whereon was paynted a golden Eagle in a field of blew: which signified the auncient Armes of Rome: likewise hee had the Tytle of the Azurde Knight, whose matchlesse Chiualrie for that day, wan the Prize from all the Graecian Knights, to the great reoysing of his Lady Rossalinde, the King of Sycils Daughter, that still remained

There likewise remayned in the Court, the six Scythian Uirgins, that in former times liued in the shape of Swans, which were as beautifull Ladies as euer eye beheld: also many other Laidies attended the Empresse, in whose companies the seauen Champions daylie delighted: sometimes discoursing of amorous conceits: other times delighting themselues with swéete tuned Musicke: then spending the day in banqueting, reuelling, dancing, & such like pastimes, not once iniuring their true betrothed Ladies. But their Courtly pleasures continued not long, for they were sodainely dashed with a present newes of open Warres proclaymed against Christendome, which fell out contrarie to the expectations of the Christian Knights. There ariued in the Graecian Emperours Pallace, a hundred Harrolds of a hundred seuerall Prouinces, which proclaimed vtter defiance to all Christiā kingdomes by these words.
            Wee the high and mighty Emperours of Asia and Affrica, great commaunders both of land & seas, proclaime by generall consent of all the Easterne Potentates, vtter ruine and destruction to the Kingdomes of Christendome, & to all those Nations where any Christian Knights are harboured: First the Soldan of Persia in reuenge of a bloody slaughter done in hys Pallace, by an English Champion: Ptolomie the Egiptian King in reuenge of his daughter violently taken away by the sayd knight: Almidor the blacke King of Moroco in reuenge of his Quéene likewise taken away by the sayde English Champion: The great Gouernour of Thessaly in reuenge of his daughter taken away by a French Knight: The King of Ierusalem in reuenge of his daughter taken away by a Spanish Knight: The Tartarian Emperour in reuenge of his Sonne the

Countie Palatine, slaine by the vnhappy hand of the Champion of Wales: The Sicillian Monarke in reuenge of hys vaine trauaile after his seauen daughters, now in the kéeping of certaine Christian Knights: in reuenge of which iniuries, all the Kingdomes from the furthest part of Prester Iohns Dominions to the borders of the red Seas, hath set downe their handes and seales to bee ayders in this bloodie Warre.
            This Prolamation béeing no sooner ended, but the Graecian Emperour likewise consented to their bloody determination, and thereupon gaue spéedy commandement to muster vp the greatest strength that Graecia could afforde, to ioyne with the Pagans, to the vtter ruine and confusion of Christendome: which bloody edict, or rather inhumane Iudgement pronounced by the accursed Infidels, compelled the Christian Champions to a spéedy departure, and euerie one to haste into his owne countrie, there to prouide for the Pagans entertainment: So after due considerations the seauen Champions departed from Graecia in companie of their betrothed Ladies: who chose rather to liue in the bosoms of their husbands, than in the armes of their misbeléeuing Parents: where after some few dayes they ariued in the spacious bay of Portingale, in which Hauen they vowed by the Honour of true Knighthood, to méete againe within sixe monthes insuing: there to conioyne all their Christian Armies into one Legion: vpon which plighted resolution the worthie Champions departed one from another: Saint George into England: Saint Dennis into Fraunce: Saint Iames into Spaine: Saint Anthonie into Italie: Saint Andrew into Scotland: Saint Pattrick into Ireland: Saint Dauid into Wales: whose pleasant bankes they had not beheld in many a yeare before: where their entertainments were as Honorable as their harts desired: But to speake of the mustring vp of Souldiers in euerie Christian Kingdome, and what strength ariued at the appointed time in the bay of Portingale, shall be discoursed

               How the seauen Champions of Christendome ariued with their Troupes in the bay of Portingale, the number of the Christian Armies, and how Saint George made an Oration to his Souldiers.
            
            
               AFter the seauen Champions of Christendome ariued in their Natiue Countries, and by true reportes had blazed abroade to euerie Princes eare the bloody resolution of the Pagans, & how the Prouinces of Affrica and Asia, had mustered vp their forces to the inuasion of Europe. All Christian Kinges then at the intreatie of the Champions, appointed mighty Armies of wel approoued soldiers both by sea & land,

to intercept the Infidels wicked intention: likewise by the whole consent of Christendome, the Noble and Fortunate Champion of England saint George, was appointed chiefe Generall, and principall leader of the Armies, and the other sixe Champions elected for hys Councell, and chiefe assistants in all attempts that appertained either to the benefit of Christendome, or the furtherance of their fortunate procéedings. This Honorable warre so fired the hearts of many youthfull Gentlemen, and so incouraged the mindes of euery common Souldier, that some morgagde their lands, and at their owne proper charges furnished themselues: Some sold their Patrimonies to serue in this Honorable warres: and other some forsooke Parents, Kindred, Wife, Children, friends and acquaintance, and without constraint of pressing, offered themselues to follow so Noble a Generall, as the renowned Champion of England, and to spend their blood in the iust quarrell of their Natiue Countrie. To be briefe, one might beholde the stréetes of euerie Towne and Cittie throughout all the Dominions of Europe, beautefied with Troupes of Souldiers, which thirsted after nothing but Fame and Honour. Then the ioyfull sound of thundring Drums, and the ecchoes of siluer Trumpets summoned them to Armes, that followed with as much willingnes, as the Graecians followed Agamemnon to the wofull ouerthrow of Troy: for by that time the Christian Champions had sported themselues in the bosomes of their kinde Mistresses▪ the forward Captaines taken leaue of their Courtly pastimes, and the willing Souldiers bidden adue to their friendes & acquaintance, the spring had couered the earth with a newe liuerie: which was the appointed time, the Christian Armies should méete in Portingale, there to conioyne their seuerall Troupes into one Legion: which promise caused the Champions to bid adue to their Natiue Countries, and with all spéed to buckle on their furnitures, and to hoyst vp sayles: where after a short time, the winde with a calme

and prosperous gale, cast them happely into the bay of Portingale. The first that ariued into that spacious Hauen, was the Noble Champion saint George, with a hundred thousand of couragious English Souldiers, whose forwardnes betokened a fortunate successe, and their willing mindes a ioyfull victorie

the Princelie minded Champion saint Dauid of Wales with an Armie of fiftie thousand of true borne Brittaines, furnished with all habilliments of Warre to so Noble and valiant a seruice, to the high renowne of hys countrie and true Honour of hys Progenie: their Armour in richnes nothing inferiour to the Englishm

            CHAP. XV. 
            
               How the Christians ariued in Egipt, and what hapned to them there: the Tragedie of the lustfull Earle of Couentrie: how Sabra was bound to a stake to be burned, & how Saint George redeemed her: lastly how the Egiptian king cast himselfe from the toppe of a Tower and broake hys necke.
            
            
               DUring the time of the bloodie murther wrought by the barbarous Moores vpon the English Marchant and hys Wife, with his seauen Children as you hearde in the former Chapter, the Champions of Christendome ariued vppon the Territories of Egipt, where they supposed to haue met with Legions of Armed Souldiers, and to haue aduentured their liues vpon the chaunce of Warre: but all things fell out contrarie to their expectations, for they founde the Gates of euerie Cittie set open, and euerie Uillage and Towne vnpeopled: for the Commos at the report of the Christians ariuall, secretly hid their treasure in the Caues of the earth, in déepe Welles, and such like obscure places, and a generall feare and extreame terrour assailed the Egiptians: as well the Pieres of the Land, as the simple countrie people: Many fled into woods and wildernesses, & closelie hid themselues in hollow trées: Many digged caues in the ground, where they thought best to remaine in safetie, and many fled to high mountaines, where they long tim
                  •
                liued in great extreamity, féeding vppon the grasse of

the ground: So greatly the Egiptians feared the Armie of Christians, that they expected nothing but the ruine of their owne countrie, with the losse of their owne liues, and the murther of their wiues and Children.
            But to speake of the Christian Champions: who finding the countrie desolate of people, suspected some déepe pollicie of the Egiptians, thinking them to haue mustered their generall forces to bid them battaile: therefore Saint George gaue commaundement through the whole Campe, that not a man vpon paine of death shuld breake his ranke, but martch aduisedlie with thrée weapons ready prest to enter battaile, as though the enemie had directly plast themselues opposite against them: which speciall charge the Christian Souldiers dulie obserued, looking neyther after the wealth of Citties, nor the spoyle of Uillages, but circumspectly martched according to their leaders directions, along the Countrie of Egipt, till they approached the sight of King Ptolomies Court: which when the noble Champion of England beheld, in this manner incouraged hee hys followers.
            Behold (saide hée) you inuincible Captaines of Christendome yonder cursed Towers where wicked Ptolomie kéepes hys Court, those Battlements I say, were they as richlie built as great Piramides of Greece, yet shoulde they be subuerted and laid as leuell with the ground, as the Cittie of Carthage: there hath that accursed Ptolomie hy

            At which wordes the souldiers gaue a generall shoute in signe of their willing mindes. Then began the s

            With this resolution martched the Cstristians, purposing the vtter confusion of the Egiptians, and the wofull ruine and destruction of Ptolomies sumptuous Pallace: but when the Souldiers approached the gates with wrathfull weapons, ready to assault, there came pacing out thereat the Egiptian King, with all the chiefest of his Nobles attired in blacke and mourn

This vnexspected sight, or rather admirable woonder, caused saint George to sound retreate, and gaue commandement through the Christian Armie, to withhold their former vowed vengeance from the Egiptians, till hee vnderstoode what they required: which charge being giuen and o

            This penitent lamentation of the Egiptian King caused the Christian Champions to relent, but especially Saint George: who hauing a hart beautified with the welspring of pittie, not onely graunted mercie to the whole Country, but vouchsafed Ptolomie libertie of life, vppon condition that he would performe what he had promised: which was to forsake hys false gods, & beleeue in our true God, Christ Iesus.
            This kindenes of saint George almost rauished Ptolomie with ioy, and the whole land, both Pieres and Commons more reioyced at the friendshippe of the Christians, than if they had béene made Lordes of the westerne world. The newes of this happie vnetie, was bruted into all the partes of Egipt: whereby the commons that before fled for feare into woods and wildernesses, dens and caues, hils and mountaines, returned ioyfully to their own dwellings, and caused bonefires to be made in euerie Cittie, Towne, & Uillage, the Bels of Egipt rung day and night, for the space of three monthes: in euerie place was séene banquetting▪ dauncing and masking, sorrow was banished, warres forgotten, and peace proclaimed.
            The King at his owne charges ordained a sumptuous & costlie banquet for the Christian Champions: wherein for bountie it excéeded that which the Troianes made when Paris returned from Greece with the conquest of Menalaus Quéene. The banquetting house was built with Cipresse wood, couered with the purest Adamant stone: so that neither stéele nor bace Iron could come therein, but it was presently drawen to the top of the rooffe: as for the varietie of seruices, which graced forth the banquet, it were too tedious to repeate: but to be briefe, what both the Land & Sea▪

            This resolution of the vertuous Ladie daunted so the Earle, that he stoode like a sensles image gazing at the Sun, not knowing how to replie, but yet when they had daunced the third course, he began a new to assault her vnspotted chastetie

            Thus departed Sabra with a frowning countenance, whereby the rest of the Ladies suspected that the Earle had attempted her dishonour by secret conference, but they all assuredly knew that she was as farre from yéelding to hys desires as is the aged man to become young againe, or the azurde firmament to be a place for siluaine beastes to inhabit: In such like imaginations they spent awaie the day, till the darke night caused them to breake off companie.

               O eares more deafe, than senceles troubled seas:
               O cruell foe, thy rigor doth excell,
               For thee I dye, thy anger to appease:
               But time will come when thou shalt finde me slaine,
               That thy repentance will increase thy payne.
            
            
               I here ingraue my will and testament,
               That my sad griefe thou mayst behold and see:
               How that my wofull heart is torne and rent,
               And gorg'd with blooddy blade for loue of thee:
               Whome thou disdayndst as now the end doth try,
               That thus distrest dost suffer me to dye.
            
            
               Oh Gods of loue if so their anie be,
               And you of loue that feeles the deadly payne:
               Or Sabra thou that thus afflictest me,
               Heare these my wordes, which from my hart I straine:
               Ere that my corpes be quite bereaud of breath,
               Let me declare the cause of this my death.
            
            
               You mountaine Nimphes which in the desarts raigne,
               Cease off your chase from sauage beasts a while:
               Prepare to see a hart opprest with paine,
               Addresse your eares to heare my dolefull stile▪
               
               No strength nor Arte, can worke me any weale,
               Sith she vnkinde and Tyrantlike doth deale.
            
            
               You Fayrie Nimphes of louers much adorde,
               And gracious Damsels which in Eueninges faire:
               Your Closets leaue, with heauenlie beautie storde▪
               
               And on your shoulders spread your golden haire:
               Record with me, that Sabra is vnkinde,
               Within whose breast remaines a bloody minde.
            
            
               
               Yee sauage Beares in Caues and Dens that lie,
               Remaine in peace if you my sorrowes heare:
               And be not mooued at my miserie,
               Though too extreame my passions doo appeare:
               England farewell and Couentrie adue,
               But Sabra, heauen aboue still prosper you.

            First my Lord (quoth she) shall you suffer me to fit some certaine houres vpon this bed of violets, and bewaile the losse of my good name, which shortly shall bee yéelded vp to your pleasure: then shall you lie and dallie in my lap thereby to make my affections, yet fréezing cold, to flame with burning brandes of loue: that béeing done you shall receaue your wished desires. These wordes caused the Earle to conuert his furious wrath to smiling toy, and so casting downe his dagger, he gaue her a curteous kisse, which shee in his conceite graciously accepted: whereby hys mind was brought into such a vaine opinion, that he thought no Heauen but in her presence: no comfort but in her sight: and no pleasure but in her loue: then caused he Sabra to sit downe vpon a bed of violets, beset about with diuers sorts of flowers, whose lay hée made his pillow, whereon he laide hys head, intending as he thought to increase desire: But as women in extreamitie haue the quickest wittes: So Sabra busied her selfe by all meanes possible, eyther now or neuer to remooue the cause of her déepe distresse by practising hys death, and so quit her selfe from her importunate sutor: one while she told him pleasant tales of loue, in hope to bring his sences to a slumber, the better to accomplish her desires: other whiles shee played and sported with hys haire that hung dangling below his shoulders like to threds of silke: But at last when neyther discoursing tales, nor her

                her vndefiled body from his lustfull desires: So taking the Poyniard in her hand, which he had cast a little aside, and gazing thereon with an irefull looke, she made this sad complaint.
            
               Graunt you immortall powers of heauen (said she) that of these two extreames I choose the best, either must I yeeld my body to bée dishonored by his vnchast desires, or staine my handes with the trickling streames of his heart blood▪ If I yéeld vnto the first, I shall be then accounted for a viscious Dame in euerie place: but if I commit the last I shall be guiltie of a wilfull murder, and for the fame the law will adiudge me to a shamefull death. What shall I feare to die and loose my vertue and renowne? No, my heart shall bée as tyrranous as Danaus Daughters, that slewe their fiftie husbands in a night, or as Medeas crueltie, which scattered her brothers bloodie ioynts vpon the sea shore, therby to hinder the swift pursute of her father, when Iason got the golden Fléece from Calcos Ile: Therefore stand still you glistring Lampes of heauen, stay wandring time and let him sléepe eternally. Where art thou sad Melpomene, that speakst of nothing but of murthers and Tragedies? Where be those Dames that euermore delights in blood? Come, come, assist me with your cruelties, let me excéede the hate of Progne, for her rauishment: rage hart, and take delight in blood, banish all thoughts of pitty from thy breast, be thou as mercilesse as King Priams Quéene, that in reuenge of fiue and twenty murthred sonnes, with her owne hands staynd the pauements of Agamemnons Court with purple gore: these words being no sooner ended, but with wrathfull and pale countenance, she sheathed the Poyniard vp to the hilts in the closure of his breast, whereat he started, and woulde haue got vpon his féete, but the streame of blood so violently gushed from his wound, that hee declined immediatly to the earth, and his soule was forced to giue the world a dolefull adue.
            But when Sabra behold the bedde of violets stainde with blood, and euery flower conuerted to a crimson colour, shée sighed grieuously, but when she saw her garments all to be sprinckled with her enemies blood, and he lay wallowing at her féete in purple go
                  •
               e she ran spéedily vnto a flowing fountaine

that stoode on the further side of the Orchard, and began to wash the blood out of her clothes, but the more shee washed, the more it increased, a signe that heauen will neuer suffer wilfull murder to be hid, for what cause soeuer it is done.
            This straunge spectakle or rather wonderfull accident, so amazed the sorrowfull Lady, that shee began a newe to complaine. O that this wicked murther neuer had bin done (said shée) or that my hand had béene stroken lame, by some vnluckie Plannet, when first it did attempt the déede! whether shall I flie to shrowde me from the company of vertuous women, which will for euermore shun me as a detested murtherer? If I should goe into some forraine Countrie, there heauen will cast downe vengeance for my guilt: If I should hide my selfe in woods and solitarie wildernesses, yet would the winde discouer me, and blow this bloody crime to euery corner of the world: or if I should goe liue in Caues or darkesome Dennes, within the déepe foundation of the earth, yet will his Ghost pursue me there, and haunt mee day and night: so that in no place a murtherer can liue in rest, such discontented thoughts shall still oppresse his mind. After shée had breathed forth this comfortles lamentation to the aire, she tore her blood stayned Garment from her backe and cast it into the fountaine, where it turned the water into the colour of blood: so heynous is murther in the sight of heauen.
            Thus béeing disrobed into her Petticote, she returned to the slaughtered Earle, whome shee founde couered with mosse, which added more griefe vnto her sorrowfull soule, for she greatlie feared her murther was discried, but it fell not out as she mustrusted: for it is the nature and kind of a Robbin Red-brest and other birdes, alwaies to couer the bodie of any dead man, and them it was that br

               d this feare in the Ladies heart: by this time the day began to shut vp his bright windowes, and sable night entred to take possession of the earth: yet durst not the wofull and distressed

               Sabra make her repaire homewards, lest she should bee discried without her vpper garment.
            During which time there was a generall search made for the Earle by his seruauntes, for they greatly suspected some daunger had befallen him, considering that they heard him the night before so wofullie complaine in his Chamber: At last with Torch light they came to the Orchard gate, which they presently burst open: wherein no sooner entring, but they found their murthered Master, lying by a bed of violets couered with mosse, likewise searching to find out the murtherer: At last they espied Sabra in her naked Petticote, her handes & face besprinckled with blood, & her countenance as pale as ashes: by which signes they suspected her to be the bloody bereauer of their Lord & Masters life: therefore because she descended from a noble linnage, they brought her the same night before the King, which did then keepe hys Court in the Cittie of Couentrie: who immediatly vpon the Confession of the murther, gaue this seuere iudgment against her: First to be conueied to Prison, there to remaine for the tearme of twelue moneths, and at the end whereof, to be burned like a most wicked offender: yet because she was the Daughter of a King, and loyall Lady to so Noble a Knight, his Maiesty in mercie graunted her this fauour: that if she could get any Knight at Armes before the time were expired, that would be her Champion, and by Combat redéeme her from the fire, she should liue: otherwise, if her Champion were vanquished, then to suffer the former Iudgement. Thus haue you heard the true discourse of all things which hapned, till my departure from England, where I left her in Prison, and since that time, fiue monthes are fullie exspired: Therefore most renowned Champion, as you loue the life of your Ladie and wish her deliuerie make no tarriance, but with all spéed post into England, for I greatly feare before you ariue vppon that blessed shore, the time will be finished, and Sabra suffer death for want of a Champion to defend her cause.
            
               This doleful discourse draue saint George with the other Knights and Champions to such an e

               tasie of minde, that euery one departed to their lodging Chambers with dumbe signes of sorrow, being not able to speake one word, where for that night they lamented the mishap of so vertuous a Lady: The Egyptian King her father, he abandoned the sight of all companies, and repayred to the toppe of an high Tower built of Marble stone, wherein hee barred himselfe fast with yron bolts, so that none could come within the hearing of his lamentations: then raged hee vp and downe like franticke Oedipus, tearing his eyes from their naturall Celles, accusing heauen of iniustice, condemning earth of iniquity, and accursing man for such an execrable crime, one while wishing his daughters byrth hower, had béene her buriall day, another while, that some vnlucky Plannet would descend the firmament, and fall vppon his miserable head: being in this extreame passion, hee neuer hoped to sée his daughters countenance againe, and so about midnight, being a time when desperate men practise their owne destructions, he cast himselfe headlong from the toppe of the Tower and broake his necke, and all besprinckled the flinty pauements with his blood and braines.
            No sooner was the night vanished, and bright Phoebus entred the Zodiacke of heauen, but his bruised body liueles and senseles, was found by his seruants lying in the Pallace yard, all to be beaten in péeces against the grounde. The wofull newes of this selfe-wild murtherer, they presently told to certaine Egyptian Knights, who tooke his scattered limbs and carryed them to saint Georges Chamber; where they found him arming himselfe for his departure towardes England: But at this wofull spectackle, he tooke a seconde conceited griefe, in such extreame manner, that it had almost cost him his life, but that the Egyptian Knights gaue him many comfortable spéeches, and by thē consent of many Dukes Earles, Lords, and Barrons, with many other of the late Kings priuy Councell, they el

and hardier Knight they thought liued not then vpon the face of the whole earth: he so aduanced himselfe vp & downe as though hee had béene able to Encounter with a hundred Knights: then the King caused the Harrold to summon in the Defendant, if there were any to defend her cause both Drums and Trumpets sounded thrée seuerall times vp & downe the fieldes, betwixt euerie rest was full a quarter of an houre, but yet no defendant did appeare: therefore the King commaunded the Executioner to set the stake on fire presently.
            At which words Sabra began to grow as pale as ashes and hir Ioyntes to tremble like to Aspen-leaues, hir toung that before continewed silent began to recorde a swanlike dying tale, & in this manner vttered she the passion of hir heart.

Commaund that eyther my Lorde may come to be my Champion, or sad beholder of my death: But if my hands were stained with blood about some wicked enterprise: then heauen shew present vengeance vppon me by fire, or els let the earth open & deuoure my bodie vp aliue. At which instance she heard the sound of a shrill and lowd horne, the which S. George winded: (for as then hée was néere) which caused the Execution a while to bee deferred: At last they beheld a farre off a stately Banner wauering in the Ayre, the which the Knight carried before saint George: then they espied nere vnto the Banner a most valiant Armed Knight mounted vpon a cole blacke Palfray, with a mightie great Launce set charged in his Rest, by which sodaine approach they knewe him to bée some Champion that would defende the distressed Ladyes cause.

            In this manner went hee vnto the Kinges Pallace, not known by any what he should be, but that he was a Knight of a strange Country, yet Sabra many times as they walked by the way, desired to see his face, and knowe his name, in that he had aduentured so farre for her sake, and that for her deliuery had vanquished the brauest knight in England. Yet for all her perswasions hee kept himselfe vndiscouered, till a troupe of Ladies in company of Sabra got him into a chamber richly hung with Arras cloth, and there vnlaced his Beuer, whose countenance when she beheld, and sawe that it was her Lord and husband which had redeemed her from death▪ shée fell into a deade sounde for very ioy: But saint George sprinckled a little colde water on her face, and reuiued

               How Saint George in his iournie towardes Persia, ariued in a Countrie inhabited onely by maides, where hee atchiued many strange and wonderfull aduentures: Also of the rauishment of seauen Virgins in a wood, and howe Sabra preserued her Honour from a tirrible Gyant.

               In this extreamety they trauelled vp and downe for thirty dayes, but at last it was theyr happy fortunes to ariue before a rich Pauillion, scituate and standing in the open fields, which seemed to be the most glorious sight that euer they beheld, for it was wrought of the richest worke in the world, all of gréene and crimson satten, bordred with golde and azure, the posts that 
                  〈◊〉
                was of Iuory, the cordes of greene silke, and on the toppe thereof there stoode an Eagle of gold, and at the two corners, two great siluer Griffons shining against the sunne, which seemed in richnes to exceede the monument of Mausalus being one of the worlds twelue wonders. They had not there remayned long, admiring at the beauty of the workemanship, but at the entry of the Pauillion, there appeared a mayden Quéene Crowned with an imperiall Diademe, who was the most fayrest creature that euer hee sawe: on her attended twenty Amazonian Dames, baring in theyr handes siluer bowes of the Turkish fashion, and at theyr backes hung quiuers full of golden Arrowes: vppon theyr heades they wore siluer Coronets, beset with Pearles and precious stones: theyr attire comelie and gallant: theyr faces faire and gentle to behold, theyr foreheads playne and white, the tramels of theyr hayrelike burnisht golde, theyr browes small and proper, somewhat drawing to a browne colour: theyr visages plaine, neither too long, nor too round, but coloured like Roses and Lillies mixt together, theyr noses long and strait, their ruddy mouths somewhat smiling, their eyes louely, and all the rest of theyr parts and liniaments by nature framed most excellent, who had made them in beauty without compare: The Quéene her selfe was cloathed in a gowne of gréene, straight gyrt vnto her body with a lace of gold, so that somewhat her rounde and Lilly white breast might be séene, which became her wonderfull well, beside all this, shee had on a crimson Kertle, lined with violet veluet, and her wide sléeues were likewise of gréene silk unbrothred with flowers of golde, and with rich Pearles:

when saint George had sufficiently beheld the beauty of this mayden Quéene, hee was almost intrapped in her loue, but that the deare affection he bare to his owne Lady preuented him, whome hee woulde not wrong for all the treasures betwixt the highest heauens, and the lowest earth: At last he alighted from his horse, and humbled himselfe vnto her Excellence and thus curteously began to question with her after this manner.
            Most diuine and fayer of all fayers, Quéene of swéete beauty (sayd he) let a trauelling Knight obtaine this fauor at your hands, that both himselfe and his Lady whome you behold here wearied with trauell, may take our rest within your Pauillion for this night: For wee haue wandred vp and downe this Country many a day, neither séeing man to giue vs lodging, nor finding foode to cherrish vs, which made vs woonder that so braue a Country, and so beautefied with natures ornamenes as this is, should be left desolate of people, the cause whereof is straunge I knowe and full of woonder,
            This question beeing curteously demaunded by saint George, caused the Amazonian Quéene as kindly to reply: Syr Knight quoth she, (for so you séeme both by your behauiour, and galiant stature) what fauour my Pauillion may afford be assured of: But the remembrance of my Countries desolation which you speake of, bréedes a sea of sorrowe in my soule, and makes me sigh when I remember it, but because you are a Knight of a strange Land, I will report it though vnto my griefe: about some twelue yeares since, it was a Nigromancers chaunce to ariue within this Country, his name is Osmond, the cunningst Artist this day liuing vpon the earth, for he can at his call raise all the spirits out of hell: and with his charmes make heauen to raine continuall showers of bloode, my beauty at that instance tempted him to loue, and drowned his senses so in desire, that hee assayed by all perswasions that either wit or Art could deuise, to winne me to his will: but I hauing vowde

            Now as I am true English Knight (replied S. George) no sooner shall the morninges Sunne appeare but I wil take my iournie to that inchaunted Tower: in to which Ile enter in despite of the Gyant, and breake the Inchantment, or make my graue within the Monsters bowelles: which if I happely perfourme, then will I trauaile into Persia, and feltes vp the most wicked and damned Nigtomancer, and like a blood hound lead him vp and downe the world in Chaynes▪
            
            Most dangerous is the aduenture (quoth the Amazonian Quéene) from whence as yet did neuer Knight returne: But if thou be so resolute and Noble minded as to attempt the enterprise, then happie bee your fortune. And knowe braue Knight, that this tower lieth westward, from hence some thréescore miles, and thereupon shée tooke him by the hand, and caused Sabra likewise to alight from her Palfray and led them both into her Pauilion: where they were feasted most royally, and for that night slept securely: But when the dayes bright windowes opened, and the Morning Sunne began to glister, in all the haste saint George that valiant minded Champion, arose from his swéet content, and Armed him selfe: where after hee had taken hys leaue of the Quéene, and gaue her thankes for hys curteous entertainement, and also taken hys leaue of Sabra: whome he left in companie of the Quéenes maides, till hys returne with conquest, and so rode foorth till it was Noone, and then he entred into a déepe Ualley, and euer hee rode lower and lower. It was then a faire day, and the Sun shined cleare: but by that time he had ridden two miles and a halfe, he had lost both the light of the Sunne, and also the sight of heauen: for it was there as darke as night, & more dismall than the déepest dungeon▪
            
            
               At last he found a mighty riuer with streames as blacke as pitch, and the bankes were so high, that the water coulde scarce bee séene running vnderneath, and it was so full of Serpents, that none could enter amongst them that euer returned backe with life: Abou

            In this dangerous manner rode he on, till he came to the gates of the inchaunted Tower, where as the Gyant sate in his yron coate vpon a blocke▪ with a mace of steele in his hand, who at the first sight of saint George, beate his téeth so mightely together, that they rung like the strokes of an Anuile, and ran raging like a Fiende of hell, thinking to haue taken the Champion horse and all in his long téeth, that were as sharpe as stéele, and to haue borne them presently into the Tower: But when saint George perceiued his mouth open, he tooke his sword and thrust therein so far, that it made the Gyant to roare so lowd, that the Elements séemed to thunder, and the earth to tremble, his mouth smoakt like a fiery Furnace. and his eyes rowled in his head lik

neuer to leaue him in extreamitie, & to answere him truely to all questions whatsoeuer: Then saint George demaunded the cause of the darkenes, and how it might be ceased, to which the Gyant answered in this manner.
            There was within this Countrie about some twelue yeares since, a cunning Nigromancer that by Inchauntment built this Tower, the which you nowe beheld, and therein caused a tyrrible fire to spring from the earth, that cast such a smoake ouer the whole land: whereby the people that were wont to dwell therein are fled and famished for hunger: Also this Inch

            Thus when the Giant had ended hys discourse, saint George commaunded him to remaine at the Gat

with his shield to defend himselfe, or els he had beene brused to peeces: At last hee came to the bottome, and there hee found a faier great vault, where he felt so tyrrible a heate, that he sweat excéedingly, and as he felt about him, hee perceaued that he approached néere the fire, and going a little further he espied out the Fountaine, whereat hee greatlie reioyced: and so he tooke his shield, and bore therein as much water as he could and cast it into the fire: In conclusion, labouring so long till the fire was cleane quenched, then began the skyes to receaue their perfect lightnes, and the golden Sunne to shine most clearelie about him, whereby hee plainely perceaued how there stoode vppon the stayers many great Images of Brasse, holding in their handes mightie Maces of stéele, the which had done him much trouble at his comming downe: but then their power was ended, the fire quenched, and the Inchauntment finished.
            Thus when saint George through hys inuincible fortitude had performed this dangerous aduenture, hee grew wearie of trauaile: what with heate and sweating, and the mightie blowes he receaued from the Br

               zen Images, that he returned againe to the little wicket: whereas the deformed Gyant still remayned: who when he beheld the Champion returne both safe and sound, hee fell vppon hys knée before him and said.
            Sir Knight you are most welcome, and happilie returned: for you are the flower of Chiualrie, and the brauest Champion in the world. Commaund my seruice, dutie and obedience: for whilst I liue I doe protest by the burning Banckes of Acharon, neuer to follow any Knight but you, and thereupon I kisse your golden spurre, which is the Noble badge of Knighthood.
            This humble submission of the Gyant caused the Champion to reioyce, not for his ouerthrow, but that he had gotten so mighty a seruant: then vnlaced he his Helmet, and laie downe after hys wearie Encounter, where after hee had sufficiently rested himselfe, he tooke his iournie in companie

of the Gyant to the Amazonian Quéene: where he left hys Lady, in companie of her virgins: who like a kinde, modest, and vertuous wife, during all the time of her husbands absence, continually praied to the immortal powers of heauen, for his fortunate successe, and happy returne, otherwise resoluing her selfe, if the lowring destenies should crosse hys intent, and vnluckilie end his dayes before the aduenture were accomplished: then to spende the remnant of her life, amongst th

George ariued before the Pauillion, dutifully attended on by the Giant: who bore vpon his shoulder the body of a tal Oake, by which the Quéene knewe that his prowesse had redéemed her country from darkenes, and deliuered her from sorrow, care, and trouble: so in companie of he

The Quéene bestowed on saint George at hys going to bed, an imbrothered shirt, curiouslie wrought with many rare deuises, as the labors of Hercules, the triumphs of Mars, & the loues of many Potentates wrought in such

            At last hee climbed vp to the toppe of a high Mountaine béeing some two miles from the Queenes Pauilion: whereon he stood and beheld many stately Townes and Towers, high and mightie Castels, many large woods & meadowes, and manie pleasant Riuers, and about the Townes faire Uines, goodlie Pastures and fields: At last he behelde the Cittie of Argenia shining against the Sun, the place where the Quéene in former time was wont to keepe her Court: which Cittie was inuironed with déepe Ditches, the wals strongly builded, & more than fiue hundred Towers made of lime and stone: also he saw many faire Churches couered

with Lead, hauing toppes and fyiers of gold, shining most gorgeously with weather Cockes of siluer glistring against the Sun: also he saw the Burgesses houses stande like Pallaces closed with high and strong walles, barred with chaines of Iron from house to house: whereat in his hart he praised much the Noblenes and richnes of the Cittie, and saide to himselfe that it might well be called Argenia, for it séemed to be of Argent, that is as much to say of siluer.
            During the time of the Champions pleasurable walke, which continued from the breake of day, to the closing of the euening, behapned a wofull Tragedie nere vnto the Quéenes Pauilion, committed by the monstrous Gyant, whome S. George brought from the Inchaunted Tower: For that same morning when the Sun had mounted some few degrées into the firmament: Seauen of the Quéenes Uirgins in Sabraes companie, walked into a pleasant thicket of trees adioyning to her Pauilion, not onely to take the pleasure of the mornings aire: but to heare the chirping mellodie of birdes: In which thicket or groaue vnder a Pyne trée this Giant lodged the passed night: for no sooner came these beautiful Ladies vnder the branches of the trées, but the Giant cast his eye vpon them, whose rare perfections so fired the heart of the lustfull Gyant, that hee must eyther quench his desires with the spoyle of their chasteties, or end hys dayes in some monstrous manner: Therefore he starts vp from the place where he lay, and with a wrathfull countenance ran amōgst the Ladies▪ and catching them all eyght at once betwixt hys Armes, hee bore them to the furthest side of the groue, where hee rauished seauen of the Quéenes Maidens, and afterward deuoured them aliue into his loathsome bowels: But Sabra beeing the eighth of that wofull number,

                a creature deformed with Leprosie, than a Ladie of excellent feature. At length shée beeing the last of all, her time came that she should be deflowred, and the lustfull Gyant came to fetch her: but when hee beheld her visage so inuenomed, he loathed her sight, seeking neyther to rauish her, nor proffering to deuoure her: but discontentedly wandred away, greatly greeuing at the committed crime, and sorely repenting himselfe of so wicked a déede: not onely for the spoyle of the seauen Uirgins, but for the wronges proffered to so Noble a Knight: who not onelie graunted him libertie of life, but receaued him into his seruice: therefore he raged vp and downe the groaue, making the earth to tremble at hys exclamations: one while cursing his fortune and houre of creation: another while banning hys Sire and diuelish Dam: But when hee remembred the Noble Champion saint George, whose angry frowne he would not sée for all the world: therefore to preuent the same, he runne his heade most furiously against a knobbed Oake and brayned himselfe: where wee will leaue him now weltring in hys blood, and speake what became of Sab

                after this bloody accident: for after she had wandred vp and downe the thicket many a wearie steppe, incensing heauen against the Giants crueltie: the Sunne began to set, and the darke night drew on, which caused her thus to complaine.
            O you immortall powers of heauen, and you celestiall Planets, béeing the true guiders of the firmaments! open your bright celestiall gates, and send some fatall Plannet, or some burning thunderbolt, to rid mee from the vale

of miserie, for I will neuer more returne to my beloued Lord, sith I am thus deformed, and made an vglie creature, my loathsome face will proue a corasiue to his hart, and my bodie a torment to his soule, my sight will be displeasant, my company hated, my presence loathed, and euery one will shun my sight as from a Crocadiles: therefore I will remaine within this groue, till the heauens either bring mee to my former beauty, or ende my languishing misery▪ yet witnesse heauen of my loyalty vnto my Lorde, and in what extreamity I haue maintained my chastety, in remembrance of my true loue here will I leaue this chaine of gold, for my beloued Lord to finde, that he may knowe, for his sake I haue indured a world of woe: At which spéeches she tooke her Chayne (which was doubled twenty times about her necke) and left it lying all be smeard in the blood of those virgins whome the Gyant had rauished and slayne, and so betooke her selfe to a sad and solitary life, intending neuer to come in the sight of men, but to spend her dayes wandring in the woods: where we will likewise leaue her for a time & speake of saint George, who by this was returned to the Quéenes Pauillion, where hee missing his Lady, and had intelligence how that shee in company of seauen other Ladies, walked in the morning into a pleasant groue, to heare the mellody of byrdes, and since that time no newes hath béene heard of them: for as then it grewe towardes night, which caused saint George greatly to mistrust that some mischance had befalne his Lady: then he demaunded what was become of the Giant, but answere was made that hee was neyther séene nor heard off since morning, which caused him greatly to suspect the Gyants treachery, and how that by his meanes the Ladyes were preuented of theyr purposed pleasures.
            Therefore in all hast like a franticke man he ran into the thicket, filling each corner with clamours and resounding ecchoes of her name, and calling for Sabra through euery bramble bush: but there he could neyther heare the voyce of

               Sabra, nor the answere of any other Ladie, but the wofull eccho of his exclamations, which ratled through the leaues of trees: then began he to waxe something melancholie & passionate, wearing the time away with wofull lamentations, till bright Cinthia mounted on the Hemispheeres: by whose glistring beames, he saw the ground besprinckled with purple gore, & found the chaine that Sabra was wont to weare about her necke all be smeerde in blood▪ he bitterlie complained against his owne fortune, and his Ladies haples destenie, for he supposed then that the Gyant had murthered her.

            Lastly, vnder the pillow of the third were these verses likewise caractred, who blushed in his cradle like Pallas when her stroue for the golden aple with Venus and the Quéene of heauen.

               s béeing brought to light by the vertue of her skill, she prepared these rich and sumptuous Cradles, the which were brought inuisible to my Cabbinet: Likewise these Mantled & this imbrothered Couerled she franckly bestowed vpon me, and so immediatlie vanished away.
            At which wordes saint George gaue her so many kinde imbraces, and kissed her so louingly, as though it had bin the first day of their Nuptials: At last her hunger increased, and her desires thirsted so much after foode, that except shée receaued some comfortable sustenance, her life were in danger. This extreame desire of Sabra, caused S. George to burkle on his Armour, & to vnsheath his trustie sword, ready to gorge the intrails of some Deare: who swore by the

honor of true Knighthood, neuer to rest in peace, till he had purchased his hearts content. My Loue (quoth he) I will aduenture for thy sake, more daungers than Iason

            At which sight, Sabra like one distraught of sence, started from her bed, and to her weake power offered to follow the Beastes: but all in vaine: for before shee coulde get without her Cabbinet, they were past sight, and the Childrens cryes without her hearing: then like a discontented woman she turned backe, beating her breasts, re

            Thus wandred S. George vp & downe the Wildernes for the space of two dayes, hearing no newes of hys vnchristened Children: At last he approached the sight of a pleasant Riuer, which smoothlie glided downe betwixt two Mountaines: into whose streames be purposed to cast himselfe, and so by a desperate death giue end to hys sorrowes:

But as hee was committing his bodie to the mercie of the waters, and his soule to the pleasure of the heauens, hee heard a farre off the rufull s

               rike as he thought of a comfortles Babe: which sodaine noyse caused him to refraine hys desperate purpose, and with more discreation tender his owne safetie: Then casting his eye aside, it was his happie destenie to spie the thrée inhumane beastes lying at the foote of the hill, tumbling themselues against the warme Sunne, and his thrée prettie babes sucking from their wombes their most vnkindly milke: which spectackle so incouraged the Champion, that without further aduisement, with his single sword he assayled at one time the thrée Monsters, but so furiously they pursued him, that he little preuailed, and being almost breathlesse, was forced to leape into an Oringe trée, else had hee béene buried in theyr mercilesse bowels: but when the thrée wilde beasts perceiued him aboue theyr reaches, and that by no meanes they could come néere him, with theyr wrathfull iawes they so rent and tore the roote of the trée, that if by pollicie hee had not preuented them, the trée had béene puld in pieces, for at that time it was so full of ripe Oringes, and so ouerloden, that the branches séemed to bend, and the boughes to breake: of which frute he cast such abundance downe to the beastes, whereby they restrained theyr furies, and fedde so fast thereon, that in short time they grew drunke, and quite ouercome with a dead and heauy sléepe, this good and happy fortune caused S. George nimbly to leape from the trée, and with his kéene edged sword, deliuered theyr monstrous heades from theyr bodies the which being done he went to his children, lying comfortlesse vppon a mossy banke, who so pleasantly smiled in his face, that they made him greatly to reioyce, and to receiue as great pleasure in theyr sights, as though hee had béene honoured with the Conquests of Caesar, or the Royalty of Alexander, therefore after he had giuen them his blessing, he tooke them vp in his Armes, and spake these wordes following.
            
               Come, come my pretty Babes, your safe deliueries from these inhumane Monsters, will adde long life vnto your mother, and hath preserude your father from a desperate death: from henceforth let heauen be your guides, and send you as happy fortunes as Remus and Romulus, the first founders of imperious Rome, which in theyr infancies were nurced with the milke of a rauenous Wolfe: and as prosperous in your aduentures, as was that Persian Potentate which fed vppon the milke of a Bitch: At the ende of which spéeches he approached the Cabbinet, where he left his Lady mourning for the losse of her children: but at his returne, he found her almost without sence or moouing, being not able to giue him a ioyfull welcome, whereat hee fell into this extreame passion of sorrow.
            O fortune, fortune (quoth hee) how many griefes heapest thou vppon my heade? wilt thou néedes inioyne me to an endles sorrow? Sée, Sabra see, I haue redéemed our sonnes and freed them from the Tygers bloody iaws, whose wrathfull countenance did threaten death: Which comfortable speeches caused her presently to reuiue, and to take the silly Infants in her Armes, laying them sweetly vpon her yuorie bosome, at which they seemed to smile as

               ▪ and the third Dauid: the which being performed, and the Triumphes ended: which in most

sumpteous manner continued, for the space of one month: then the Bohemian King for the great loue hee bare vnto S. George, prouided most honourably for his childrens bringing vp: First, he appoynted thrée seuerall Embassadours, with all things necessary for so Princely a charge, to conduct the thrée Infants to thrée seuerall Countries: the first and eldest, whose fortune was to be a souldier, he sent to the imperiall Citty of Rome, (being then the wonder of the world for Martiall discipline) there by the Emperour to bee trayned vp. The seconde, whose fortune was to bee a Courtly Prince, hee sent to the rich and plentifull Country of England, being the pride of Christendome for all delightfull pleasures: The third and last, whose fortune was to prooue a Scholler, he sent into Germany, to the Uniuersity of Wittenberge, beeing thought at that time to bee the excellenst place of learning, that remayned throughout the whole world.
            Thus were saint Georges Children prouided for by the Bohemian King: For when the Embassadours were in a readinesse, the ships for theyr passage furnished, and their attendance appoynted, saint George in the company of his Lady, the King of Bohemia with his Quéene, and a trayne of Lords, gentlemen, and Ladyes, conducted them to shipbord, where the winde serued them so prosperously, that in short time they bid adew to the shore, and sayled chearefully away: But as saint George returned backe to the Bohemian Court, it was his chaunce to come by an olde ruinated Monastery, vnder whose walles in former time his Father was buried, the which he knewe by certaine verses that was carued in stone ouer his graue by the Commons of the Country (as you may reade before in the beginning of this History.) Ouer the same, he requested of the King, that hée might erect a stately Monument, that the remembra
                  •
               ce of his name might liue for euer, and not be buried in the graue of obscurity.
            To which reasonable demaund, the King most willingly

consented, and in all hast gaue speciall commandement, that the cunningest Architectors that remayned within his Dominion, should forthwith be sent for, and withall gaue a tun of gold forth of his owne treasury towards the performance thereof.
            The sodaine report of this memorable déede, being bruted abroade, caused workemen to come from euery place of their owne accord with such willingnes, that they in short time finished it. The foundation of the Toombe, was of the purest Marble, whereon was ingrauen the frame of the earth, and how the watry Ocean was deuided: with woods groues, hilles and dales, so liuely portrayed, that it was a wonder to behold: the props and Pinacles of Allablaster, beset with knobs of Iasper stone, the sides and Pillers of the clearest Iette, vpon the topp stoode foure golden Lions, holding vp as it were an Elemen
