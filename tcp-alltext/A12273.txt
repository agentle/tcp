               SIXTVS the fifte, by Gods prouidence the vniuerſal paſtor of Chriſtes flocke, to vvhome by perpetual and lavvful ſucceſsion, apperteyneth the care and gouernemēt of the Catholike Churche, ſeinge the pittyfull calametyes vvhich hereſy hath brought into the renoumed cuntryes of Englande and Irelande, of olde ſo famouſe for vertue, Religion, & Chriſtian obedience; And hovv at this preſent, through the impietie and peruerſe gouernemēt of Elizabeth the pretenſed Quene, with a fewe her adhearētes, thoſe kingdomes be brought not onely to a diſordered and perillouſe ſtate in them ſelues, but are become as infected members, contagious and trubleſome to the whole body of Chriſtendome; And not hauinge in thoſe parts the ordinary meanes, vvhich by the aſsiſtāce of Chriſtian Princes he hath in other prouinces, to remedy diſorders, and kepe in obedience and eccleſiaſtical diſcipline the people, for that Henry the 8. late kinge of Englande, did of late yeares, by rebellion and reuolte from the See Apoſtolike, violently ſeperate him ſelfe and his ſubiects from the cōmunion and ſocietie of the chriſtian comonvvelth; And Elizabeth the preſent vſurper, doth continevve the ſame, vvith perturbation and perill of the cuntryes aboute her, shevvinge her ſelfe obſtinate and incorrigible in ſuch ſorte, that vvithout her depriuation and depoſityō there is no hope to reforme thoſe ſtates, nor kepe Chriſtendome in perfect peace & trāquillety: Therfore our Holy Father, deſyringe as his duty is, to prouide preſent & effectuall remedy, inſpired by God for the vniuerſall benefite of his Churche, moued by the particuler affection vvhich him ſelfe and many his predeceſſors haue had to theſe natyons, And ſolicited by the Zelous and importunate inſtance of ſundry the moſt principall perſones of the ſame, hath dealt earneſtly vvith diuers Princes, and ſpecially vvith the mighty and potent Kinge Catholike of Spaine, for the reuerence vvhich he beareth to the See Apoſtolike, for the olde Amity betvvene his houſe and the Croune of England, for the ſpecyall loue which he hath shewed to the Catholikes of thoſe places, for the obteyninge of peace and quietneſſe in his cuntryes adioyninge, for the augmentinge and increaſe of the Catholike faith, and finally for the vniuerſall benefite of all Europe; that he will employe thoſe forces vvhich almighty God hath giuen him, to the depoſition of this woman, and correctiō of her complices, ſo wicked and noyſome to the worlde; and to the reformation and pacification of theſe kingdomes, vvhence ſo greate good, and ſo manifold publike commodeties, are like to enſue.
            AND to notefy to the vvorld the iuſtice of this acte, and giue full ſatisfaction to the ſubiects of thoſe kingdomes and others vvhoſoeuer, and finally to manyfeſt Gods iudgements vpon ſinne; his Holynes hath thought good, together vvith the declaratory ſentence of this vvomans chaſticement, to publiſh alſo the cauſes, vvhich haue moued him to procede againſt her in this ſorte. FIRST for that she is an Heretike, and Schiſmatike, excōmunicated by two his Holines predeceſſors; obſtinate in diſobedience to God and the See Apoſtolike; preſuminge to take vpon her, contrary to nature, reaſon, and all lavves both of God and man, ſupreme iuriſdiction and ſpirituall auctority ouer mens ſoules. SECONDLY for that she is a Baſtard, conceyued and borne by inceſtuous adultery, and therfore vncapable of the Kingdome, aſvvell by the ſeuerall ſentences of Clement the 7. and Paule the 3. of bleſſed memory, as by the publike declaration of Kinge Henry him ſelfe. THIRDLY for vſurpinge the Croune vvithout right, hauinge the impediments mentioned, and contrary to the auncyent acorde made betvvene the See Apoſtolike and the realme of England, vpon reconciliation of the ſame after the death of S. Thomas of Canterbury, in the time of Henry the ſecond, that none might be lawfull kinge or Quene therof, vvithout the approbation and conſent of the ſupreme Biſhopp: vvhich aftervvard vvas renevved by kinge Iohn, and confirmed by othe, as a thinge moſt beneficiall to the kingdome, at requeſt and inſtance of the lordes and Comons of the ſame. AND FVRTHER for that vvith ſacrilege and impiety, ſhe continevveth violating the ſolemne Othe made at her coronation, to mainteyne and defende the auncyent priuileges and eccleſiaſticall libertyes of the lande. FOR MANY and greuous iniuryes, extorſions, oppreſsions, and other wronges, done by her, and ſuffered to be done againſt the poore and innocent people of both cuntryes. FOR ſturringe vp to ſedition and rebellion the ſubiects of other nations about her, againſt their lavvfull and naturall princes, to the deſtructyon of infinite ſoules, ouerthrow and deſolation of moſt goodly cittyes and cuntryes. FOR harboringe and protectinge Heretikes, fugetiues, rebelles, and notorious malefactors, vvith greate iniury and preiudice of diuers comon vvealthes: and procuringe for the oppreſsiō of Chriſtendome and diſturbance of comon peace, to bringe in our potēt and cruell enemy the Turke. FOR ſo longe and barbarouſe perſecution of gods ſaints, aflictinge, ſpolynge, and impriſoninge the ſacred Biſhops, tormentinge, and pittyfully murtheringe numbers of holy Preiſts, and other catholike perſons. FOR the vnnatural and iniuſt impriſonment, and late cruelty vſed againſt the moſt gracyous Princeſſe, Mary Quene of Scotland, vvho vnder promiſe and aſſurance of protection and ſuccor, came firſt into Englande. FOR aboliſhinge the trevv Catholike religion; prophaninge holy Sacramēts, Monaſteryes, Churches, Sacred perſons, Memories of ſaints, and vvhat els ſo euer might helpe or further to eternal ſaluation: And in the Comon vvelth, diſgraceing the auncyent Nobility, erecting baſe and vnvvorthy perſons to all the Ciuile and Eccleſiaſtical Dignetyes, ſellinge of lavves and iuſtice, And finally exercyſinge an abſolute Tyrannie, with high offence to almighty God, oppreſſyon of the people, perdition of ſoules, and ruine of thoſe cuntryes.
            WHERFORE, theſe thinges beinge of ſuch nature & qualety, that ſome of thē make her vnable to reigne, others declare her vnworthy to liue; His Holineſſe, in the almighty power of God, and by Apoſtolical auctority to him committed, doth renewe the ſentēce of his predeceſſors Pius 5. and Gregorie the 13. tooching the Excōmunication and depoſition of the ſad Elizabeth: and further a nevve doth Excommunicate, and depriue her of all auctority and Princely dignety, and of all title and pretenſy on to the ſaid Croune and Kingdomes of England and Ireland; declaringe her to be illegittimate, and an vniuſt vſurper of the ſame; And abſoluinge the people of thoſe ſtates, and other perſons whatſoeuer, from all Obedience, Othe, and other bande of Subiection vnto her, or to any other in her name. And further doth ſtraitely commaunde, vnder the indignation of almighty God, and nayne of Excōmunication, and the corporal puniſhmēt appoynted by the lawes, that none, of whatſoeuer condition or eſtate, after notice of theſe preſents, preſume to yeilde vnto her, Obedience, fauor, or other ſuceurſe, But that they and euery of them concurre by all meanes poſsible to her chaſtiſement. To the ende, that ſhe which ſo many wayes hath forſaken God and his Churche, beinge now deſtitute of wordly comforte, and abandoned of all, may acknowledge her offence, and humbly ſubmitt her ſelfe to the iudgements of the higheſt.
            BE IT THERFORE notefyed to the inhabitants of the ſaid Cuntryes, and to all other perſons, that they obſerue diligently the premiſſes, withdrawinge all ſuccor publike and priuate, from the party purſued and her adherents, after they ſhall haue knowlege of this preſent: And that forthwith they vnite them ſelfs to the Catholike army conducted by the moſt noble and victorious Prince, Alexander Farneſius, Duke of Parma and Placentia, in name of his Maieſty, with the forces that eche one can procure, to helpe and cōcurre as ys aforeſaid (yf nede ſhall be) to the depoſition and chaſticement of the ſaid perſons, and reſtitutiō of the holy Catholike faith. Signifyenge to thoſe which ſhall doe the contrary or refuſe to doe this here cōmaunded, that they ſhall not eſcape condigne puniſhment.
            MOREOVER BE IT KNOVVEN that the intention of his Holyneſſe, of the Kinge Catholike, and the Duke his highneſſe in this enterpriſe, ys not to inuade and conquere theſe kingdomes; chaunge lawes, preuileges or cuſtomes; bereaue of liberty or liuely hoode may man (other then rebels and oſtinate perſons) or make mutation in any thinge, except ſuche, as by comon accorde, betwene his Holineſſe, his Catholike maieſty, and the ſtates of the lande, shalbe thought neceſſary, for the reſtitution and continuance of the Catholike Religion, and punishment of the vſurper and her adhearents. Aſſuringe all men, that the controuerſyes which may ariſe by the depriuation of this woman, or vpon other cauſe, eyther betwene particuler partyes, or touching the ſucceſſyon to the Croune, or betwene the Churche and Comon vvelthe, or in other wiſe whatſoeuer, shalbe decyded and determined wholy accordinge to iuſtice and Chriſtian equity without iniury or preiudice to any perſon. AND there ſhall not onely due care be had, to ſaue from ſpoyle the Catholikes of theſe cuntryes, which haue ſo longe endured, but mercy alſo ſhewed to ſuch penytent perſons, as ſubmitt them ſelues to the Capitane generall of this army. Yea for ſo much as information ys giuen, that there be many, which onely of ignorance or feare be fallen from the fayth, and yet notwithſtandinge are taken for heretikes; Neyther ys yt purpoſed, preſently to puniſh any ſuch perſons, but to ſupporte them with clemency, till by conference with lerned men and better conſideration, they may be informed of the truth, if they doe not ſhew them ſelues obſtinate.
            TO PREVENT alſo the ſheadinge of Chriſtiane bloode, and ſpoyle of the cuntry, which might enſewe by the reſiſtance of ſome principall offenders. Be it knowne by theſe preſents, that it ſhal not onely be lawfull for any perſon publike or priuate (ouer and beſides thoſe which haue vndertaken the enterpriſe) to areſte, put in holde, and deliuer vp vnto the Catholike parte, the ſaid vſurper, or any of her complices; But alſo holden for very good ſeruice and moſt highly rewarded, accordinge to the qualety and condition of the partyes ſo deliuered. And in like maner, all others, which here to fore haue aſsiſted, or herafter ſhall helpe and concurr to the puniſhment of the offenders, and to the eſtabliſhmēt of Catholike Religion in theſe prouinces, ſhall receyue that aduauncement of honor and eſtate which their good and faithful ſeruice to the comon welthe ſhall require; in which, reſpecte ſhalbe vſed, to preſerue the auncyent and honorable famelyes of the lande, in as much as ys poſsible. AND finally by theſe preſents, fre paſſage ys graunted to ſuch as wil reſorte to the catholike campe, to bringe victuals, munytion, or other neceſſaryes; promiſinge liberall paymēt for all ſuch things, as ſhal be receiued from thē for ſeruice of the army. Exhorting with all and ſtraitely commaunding, that al men accordinge to theire force and ability, be redy and diligent to aſsiſte here in; to the ende no occaſion be giuen to vſe violence, or to puniſh ſuch perſons as ſhall neglect this commaundement.
