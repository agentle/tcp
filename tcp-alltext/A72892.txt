            To the tune of the Spaniſh Pauin:
            
               WHen Philomel begins to ſing,
               the graſſe growes gréene & flowres ſpring,
               Me thinks it is a pleaſant thing,
               to walke on Primroſe hill,
               Maydes haue you any Conny-ſkins
               To ſell for Laces or great Pinnes?
               The Pope will pardon veniall ſinnes:
               Saint Peter.

               Some ſay good Wine can nere want ſale,
               But God ſend poore folkes Béere and Ale enough vntill they die.
               Moſt people now are full of pride;
               The Boy ſayd no but yet he lyde:
               His Aunt did to the Cuck-ſtoole ride
               for ſcolding.
            
            
               Within our Towne faire Suſan dwells:

               My friend, pull off your buzzards bels,

               Take héed you play not at Tray-trip.
               Short héeles forſooth will quickly ſlip.
               The beadle makes folke with his whip,
               dance naked.
