               OUre Lorde and alone
sauioure.Math. xiii Iesu Christe
declareth in a parable
of the gospell, that after
a certayne houshoulder had
sowed good seede in hys fielde,
whyle hys seruauntes slepte, hys
ennemye came and sowed tares
amonge the wheate and wente
hys waye, Thys houshoulder is
Christ the lord. The good sede is
y• children of god & gods worde.

The seruauntes that slepte are
negligente Prelates and sleepye
shepheardes, whiche watche not
ouer the Lordes flocke. The enemy
is the deuil. The tares are the
children of the wicked, & errours
and heresies, which? Satan soweth
in the heartes, of the vnbeleuinge.
Of this parable as wee
learne the goodnes of Christe toward
vs in be getting vs a new,i. Peter. i.
not of mortal sede but of immortall
by the worde of God, whiche
liueth and lasteth for euer, so like
wyse learne we the maliciousnes
of Sathan, whiche lyke a subtile
serpente and olde enemye of mā
               kinde,
neuer sleepeth, but contynuallye
walcketh vp and downe
lyke a roryng lion, seking whom
he may deuoure and warely watcheth

souer anye occasion is geuen, be
it neuer so little. Not wythoute a
great cause therefore did out sauioure.
Christ exhort vs to watch
and praye, that wee fall not into

frayle and synnefull lyfe manye
occasions of doinge myscheife be
offered to the ennemy on our behalfe
such is our negligence and
vncircumspecte beha
                  •
               youre, yet
the gratest occasion wherin Satan
most gloryeth and soonest hopeth
for the victorye, is when the
shepheardes of Christes flocke
giue no atēdaūce to theyr charge
but lye sleepynge and snortyng,
walowynge and welterynge in
theyr pleasures, and suffer the
wolf to scatter, yea to catch, to kil
and to destroye the shepe.Esaye. lvi. Ihon. x. For although
the deuil leteth go no profer,

whiche maye moue him to do
euil, but laieth hād on it streight
waies, yet as the histories both of
the holye scriptures & of credible
writers do testify, he neuer sheweth
him selfe so right a deuil nor
so liuely setteth forth him selfe in
his true colours, as whē y• guids
of the Lords flocke be either absent
frō their shepe, orels are negligēt
in doīg theyr dutie, I mean
in preching gods word, & in writing
godly bokes, if nede require
for the confutacion of erroures
and heresies and for y• establishment
of gods holi religion. How
sone had the people of Israel for
gotten god and his goodnes toward
the, after Moses was gone
from them into the moūt Sina
                  •

from the one and alone true and
liuing god vnto abhominable idolatri,
and worshipped a golden
calfe? After the daies of Moses &
of other godly Prophetes & preachers
when wicked kinges reigned,
and the preachinge of gods
worde ceased, did not ye people of
Israel fal to the worshipping of
straūge gods, & made of the brasē
serpēt (which was but a sacramēt
and figure of Christe) a God and
brent sacrifice vnto it?Ihon. iii. iiii. re. xviii Certayne
yeres before ye cōmīg of christ into
this world, into how mani sectes
& sōdry religiōs were the Iewes
deuided amōg thē selfs, whiche
not wt stādīg coūted thēselfes
onli the people of god & hated al
other naciōs, as abhominable Idolatours?
Yea in the time of the
Apostles, were ther not y• denied

Christe to be eyther true God or
true man? How sone wer the Corrinthians
and Galathians seduced
by false Apostles, after that
the mooste worthye Apostle. S.
Paul was departed from them?
Howe many kynde of Heretikes
rose there vppe in the churche of
Christe after the Apostles tyme?
What greate and howe manye
contencions both in sermons, disputacions
and wrightinges had
the holye Bishops and godly fathers
of the primatiue church wt 
the heretikes of theyr time for the
maintenaunce of gods truth and
for plucking vp y• enemies tares?
Since the time yt those verteous
Bishops and learned fathers of
Christs church died, into how many
sects haue the people y• profes
god be deuided? The number of

sectes and counterfait religious,
which yet liue vnder the Bishop
of Rome, are almoste innumerable.
Neither ceaseth Sathan euē
in this most clear light of the gospel
to play the right deuil, and to
cast mistes before the eies of the
vnfaithful. Into how many sects
is Christendome yet deuided? Ar
not some called papists, some protestants,
some Anabaptists, some
sacramentaries? Whence come
al these abhominacions but only
from sathan the author of al euil?
Moreouer in what fielde, where
good sede hath bene sowed, hath
not the ennemie sowed his tares
also? howe pestilentlye hathe he
corrupted the pure wheate of
goddes woorde wyth myngeling
hys chaffe, drosse, darnell, cockell
and tares, I mean the false gloses,

and vnsauery exposicions of

bodye and bloude? fastinge, praier
and almes deede, howe hathe
he made thē to be abused? There
is no pointe of Christen religion,
which Sathan hath not attempted
too ouerthrowe by hys ministers.
And albeit as I said before
the enemy laboureth at all times
to sowe hys tares in the Lordes
fielde, yet when the shepheardes
of Christes flocke be negligēt in
doing their dutye, fal a slepe and
loke not to the Lordes field, then
doth he most of al play his parte
and bestoure him like a right deuil,
as Salomon saythe. When

becommeth al men that tender
the glorye of God, but specyallye
the Lordes Ministers to
loke diligentlye vnto theyr lords
fielde, and earnestly to take hede
that the enemy sow not his tares
amonge the Lordes wheate. If
any be sowed, it is their duti to laboure
euen to the vttermooste of
theyr power not with violence &
corporal armours (for the vse of

                  THe true and Christen
fast is frely and willinglye
to abstaine not only
from al kind of meates
and drynckes,The diffynicyon of y• true fast. but also from all
those thynges, wherein the fleshe
hathe pleasure and delectacion,
whiche abstinence or forbearing
of meates, dryncks and other plesures,
wherein the outward man
deliteth, riseth either of an hearte
contryte and sorowefull for the

or elsse of a minde feruentlye geuen

menne in tymes paste fasted,
theyr maner was, so long as the

               ¶The .ii. Chapter.
               THis abstinence or forbearing
of meates dyd alwayes continewe
at the least one whole
day withoute receiuinge of anye
corporal sustenance,Iudi. xx. many times
ii. or .iii, daies, as the historyes of
the holye scripture teach vs. The
Israelits, whē they sawe so great
a multitude of their people slain
of the Beniamites in the battell,
wente vp and came vnto Bethel
where the arke of the appoyntement
of God was in those dayes,
wepte, sate there praying before
the lord, and fasted the same day
vnto euen, and offered burntoffe
ringes and peace offeringes before
the Lorde. Again,Reg. vii, when the

Israelites gathered together a
                     •
                  
Mizpha, lamentiug their sinnes
and prayinge vnto the Lorde for
healpe againste the Philistines,
they fasted the whole daye. So
likewise did Dauid and thei that
were with him, when they heard,
that Saule and his sonnes were
slaine in battell.ii. Reg, i. Nehemiah fasted
two dayes together or moo.
For hee saide, as it is written of
hym.Esdras. i. I sate me downe and wept,
and mourned certaine daies and
fasted and praied before the god
of heauē. We reade that Quene
EstherEsther. iiii and her Maidens wyth
all the Iewes that were founde
at Susan, fasted thre dayes and
three nightes together, and dyd
neyther eate nor dryncke. Moses,
Elias and Christe fasted fortye
dayes aud as manye nightes

wythoute receiuinge of anye corporall
foode, but suche fastes are
not to be practised, for asmuch as
they are maruelous and past the
boūdes of mens nature, and are
done onlye by the vnsearcheable
power and mightie worcking of
God in few of his creatures. But
the common manner of fastinge
among the true godly was, when
they did faste, to abstaine from al
meate the whole daie til nighte,
that they mighte the more frelye
gyue theyr minde to spiritual exercises,
and at night to take some
refeccion moderatli yea and that
with thanckes geuing. And on
thys manner as some fasted but
one or .ii. dayes together, so some
fasted manye, euerye one as they
were moued by the spirit of God,
and as occasyon requyred.
               
                  We reade that the Prophete
DanielDaniel. x. fasted thus thre weekes
together. Hys wordes are these:
I Daniel mourned for the space
of thre weekes, so that I had no
liste to eate breade, as for fleshe
and wine there came none wythin
my mouthe. No, I did not once
annoynte myselfe, till the whole
thre wekes were oute. The scripture
testifieth, that the vertuous
womā IudithIudi. viii. fasted al the daies
of her lyfe, excepte the sabbothes
and new moanes & the solempne
dayes, that the people of Israell
kepte. Likewise reade we of Anna
the Daughter of Phanuell,
whych departed not from the temple,
but serued god with fastings
and praiers night and daye.Luke. ii. On
this maner did the Apo
                     •
                  tles after
Christes ascension & many other

godlye menne in the primatyue
church fast, So that their custom
was on that daye that they dyd
fast, to eat nothing til night, but
to occupy them selues about such
godlye exersyes, as here to fore
are mencioned.
            
            
               The .iii. Chapter
               ANd as the godlye menne in
the tyme of theyr fasting did
abstayne frome meate and
drincke, so dyd they from al other
thynges that myghte delyte the
fleshe, and be haued them selues
outwardlye accordinge to the sorowe
and trouble of their hearte
inwardlye. Oute of a mourning
and soroweful hearte dyd spring
outwarde yea and those vnfayened
tokens of sorowe and mournynge.
For wee hearde before,
that when Daniell fasted three

weekes, and prayed vnto the
Lorde hys God, although he did
eate bread euerye nyghte for the
comforte of hys weake body, yet
he neyther eate flesh, nor dronck
wyne, nor yet once anoynted hym
selfe.Daniel. x. And in a nother place he saieth:
I turned me vnto God the
Lorde for to praye,Daniel. ix. and to make
myne intercession wyth fastyng,
sakcloth and ashes.Ionas. iii. The people
of Niniue, when they hearde the
preachynge of Ionas, whyche
threatened them and theyr cytye
destruccion after fortye dayes,
repented, beleued God, and proclaymed
fastyng, and arayed thē
                  selues
in sackeclothe, as well the
greate as the small of them. And
when the tidyngs came vnto the
king of Niniue: he also arose out
of his seate, & dyd his apparel of

when she fasted, layed awaye her
glorious apparel, and put on the
garmentes that serued for syghyng
and mourning. In the stede
of precious ointment, she scattered
ashes and donge vpon her
heade, and as for her bodye, shee
hūbled it with fasting, & brought
it verye lowe. Lykewyse kynge
Achab, whē he was reproued of
the Prophete Helyas for kyllynge
Nabothe, fell to fastynge,iii.

               VUhat so euer myght make
to the hūblyng and taming
of the flesh, that dyd the godly
men vse for the moste parte in
the tyme of theyr fastynge. Neyther
dyd those corporal exercyses
displease God, seynge they came
from a cōtrite hart and troubled
spirit, wholye dependynge wyth

al those thinges wherin the flesh

to occupy our selues in all godly

that thys abstinence or fast must
be frely and wyllynglye done, or
els canne it by no meanes please
God. For what so euer commeth
from an vnwilling and constrained
mynde, God abhorreth, appere
it neuer so godly and praise

The myghtiest fastis water and

the soul be oppressed wyth
dylyciousnes or superfluitye of

filled, soone dulled, and the erth
of our body so watered, wil bring
forth thornes of wicked lusts. Let
therfore our meate be temperate
& no more then is sufficient, & let
our belly neuer be to ful. And let
vs alwayes haue more mynd of
the meate for the hearte, then of
meate for the body, because with

               The .xi. Chapter.
               FUrthermore the Christen fast
ryseth of an hart contrite and
sorowful for the sins cōmitted
against God, as we haue heard

heretofore. The popish faste ryseth
either of custome or els of supersticyon.
For the Papystes in
theyr chiefe & solempne fastinge
dayes are led wyth no true feare
toward God, neyther do they lament
theyr syns, nor study by hartie
repentāce, true faith & amendment
of life to apease the wrathe
of God kindled against them for
their abominable liuing on those
dayes that they fast, more them any
other tyme. What Papiste among
them forsaketh hys papistry,
hipocrisy, supersticion, and idolatry,
and gladly receiueth the
truth of Gods word? What coueuetous
worldling leaueth his couetousnes
& exerciseth mercy toward
the pore mēbers of Christ?
What proud mā giueth ouer his
pride, and embraceth humilitie?

What adulterer forsaketh hys
adultri, and leadeth an honest cō
                  uersacion?
what gloton or dronkard
giueth ouer hys glotony or
dronkennes, and leadeth a sober
lyfe? what vsurar leaueth his vsury?
what briberer his brybery?
what catchepole hys extorcion?
what tirante hys tirannye? what
whore her whoredome? what rybalde
hys rybaldrye? what blasphemer
hys blasphemy? what enuious
man his enuy? &c. As they
begin their fast wt an vnrepentāt
& wicked hert, euen so do they
continue & end the same, so far is
it of, that they haue any sorow in
their heart for their syns committed
against God, whych shoulde
earnestlye moue them to forsake
theyr meate, and to giue them selues
wholy to be reconciled vnto
god by repentynge and callyng

on the name of God for mercy in
Christ Iesu our lord. Their fast
therfore is abhominacion before
God, forasmuch as in the time of
theyr fastyng they gyue not ouer
theyr wyckednes, and earnestlye
seeke to please God.
               Moreouer the Christē fast riseth
also of an hert feruētly geuē
to godlynes. In thys behalfe also
y• popish fast agreeth nothing
with Christē abstinence.In what the 
                        ••
                     ynges of y• papistes consisteth. For the
Papystes myndes are set on no
true godlines in the time of their
fastyng, but altogether on supersticion
& hipocrisie. Theyr godlynes,
yea rather vngodlynes,
when they fast, consisteth in obseruyng
the popes ceremonies and
mans inuencions. If they fulfyl
those, they thynke thēselues godly

hearde also, howe greatly the popyshe
manner of fastinge differeth
from the true vse of fastinge
whiche the holy scriptures teach.

that expound this text, saye that
thou then breakest thy breade to
the hungry, when thou so fastest,

that thou sparest from thine own
belly to gyue to the pore hongry
man, For a Christen man ought
to be no les careful for the poore,
then for him selfe. We therefore
do breake our bread to the hongrye,
when wee gyue hym that,
whych we our selues necessaryly
shoulde haue eaten. So that to
annoynte our head, is to breake
our bread to the hongri, to lodge
the poore in oure house, to gyue
clothes to the naked, and to comforte
accordynge to oure habilytye
so manye as haue neede of
our helpe. Unto these workes of
mercy doth our Sauiour Christ
exhort vs in the Gospel, saying:
when thou makest a dynner or a
supper,Luk. xiiii. cal not thy fryendes, nor
thy brethren, neyther thy kynsfolke,
nor thy rytch neyghbours,

leaste they also bid the againe, &

cause that God dyd caste awaye
the fastes and solemne feastes of

Of these authorities of the holye

Doctours also do we learn, that
the true Christen faste dothe not
only consiste in the abstinence of
meates, but also in the forsaking
of sinne. Therefore if we entende
to faste a right, and to make our
fast acceptable to God, let vs prouide
earnestlye, that oure faste
procede from a pure and cleane
heart, voyd of al carnall affectes,
stuffed ful of faithe and charitie,
and altogether studious of true
innocencye and vnfained godlines.
So shal it come to pas, that
both our fastes and all that euer
we do according to gods worde,
shal highly please God. Hitherto
haue we hearde what it is to annoint
the head and to washe the
face. Nowe remaineth to declare
what it is to fast in secrete.
            
            
               ¶The .xv. Chapter.
               
                  TO faste in secrete,What it is to faste in secrete. is not to
keepe oure selues close from
the sighte of men, and so hydinge
our selfes in priuy corners
to abstaine frō meate, but not to
hunte and hawke after vaine glorye
nor the prayse of men,Math. vi. for our
fastinge, nor to seke to be sene of
men whyle we faste to the ende,
that they may commend & prayse
vs, as the hipocrites did, whome
Christ reproueth for their vaine
glory and ambicion, & saith, they
haue their reward, not of god but
of mē. We ar counted before god
then to fast in secrete, whē we fast
with such a minde, yt we wold fast
in dede, thoughe no man liuinge
did se vs, aud when we regarde
more the accōplishment of gods
wyll and the subieccion and taming
of our body, then al the glorye

and praise that man can giue
vnto vs.It is lawful to do anye good deede in y• syghte of men, so y• vayne glorye be absente. It is lawful for a Christen
man to fast,Math. v. to praye to geue
almes, or to do anye other good
work before the world, so that the
desire of worldly praise and vain
glorye be not in his minde. For
our sauiour Christ saith let your
light so shine before mē that they
may se your good works & glorify
your father which is in heauen
S. Paul also saith, be such as no
man can complaine on,Philip. ii. and the
vnfained sonnes of God without
rebuke in the myds of a crooked
and peruerse nacion, among whō
se that ye shine as lyghtes in the
world, holding fast the worde of

vs, that where as some backebite
vs as euil doers, we shuld leade
an honest and godlye life among

them, that they seinge oure good
workes maye prayse God in the
daye of visitacion. But if we seke
anye prayse of men,The desire of vayne glory poy

doinge, verely then haue we our
rewarde not of God but of the
worlde. For there is not a more
pestiferous infeccion to poisonne
anye good woorcke, that it shuld
lose the reward before God, then
the desyre of vaine glory & worldlye
prayse.Math. vi. For that it is, which
Christ condemneth in the almes
dedes, praiers and fastes of the
hipocrits.Hom. xlvi in Mat. vi S. Ihon Chrisostome
saith, they that so fast, ye thei plese
men rather then God, they haue

good thinges may be done, & yet
they not doing them wel, of whom
they ar don. For it is a good thīg
to healp a man y• is in ieopardy &

good dede▪ if he doth it because he
loueth the praise of menne rather

he doth, for as much as he y• doth
it, is not good. For God forbid, y•
that shuld be or be coūted a good
wil, which glorieth in other, or in
it self,In libro. de

when thou fastest, boaste not thy

doynge thy faste profyteth the

nothing. Those thinges that are
done vnto ostentacion & bosting
continew not to be recompensed
in the world to come, but they are
consumed & brought to noughte
with the rewarde of present thinges.

Therfore all the workes that we
do, whether thei be praier, fasting
almes deede, watching, visiting
of the sicke, comforting of the prisonners,
or ani other that be agreable

do them with a single minde, and
with such an heart, as being altogether
estraūged from vain glory
and worldly praise, seketh onli
the honour of god & the accōplishment

thorowe Christe oure Lorde, I
meane the fauoure of God, the

               These be the singulare and free
giftes of God, geuen only of him
to so manye as be borne a newe

him. If the fastes of the holy men
of whome we hearde here to fore
had bene directed vnto that end,
that is, if by their fastes they had
soughte to be iustified,Gene. xii.

               But theyr fastes came from a penitent
and faithful heart toward
God, and were exercised of them
vnto godly purposes, as we haue
hearde, they seekinge saluacion
onlye at the mercyfull hande of
God for the promysed seede sake
therefore were boothe they and
theyr fastes allowed of God.The fasts of the olde Fathers. Let

               ¶The .xviii. Chapter.
               ANd heare begin we to learn
the true vse of fastinge, and
to know vnto what end our
fastes ought to be directed. The
fyrste true and godlye vse of fastynge
is to subdue the fleshe, to
mortifye her beastelye affectes,
and to represse the wilde & ranck
mocions thereof, that it maye be
subiecte and obediente to the spirite
as an handmaide to her mastres,
or a seruaunte to his Lord.

For al be it God hathe made vs
of two partes, that is, of bodye
and spirite, yet hath he ordayned
the spirite to bee ruler, and the
fleshe to bee in subieccion to the
spirite.The rebellion of the fleshe against the spirite. But not wyth standynge
the fleshe (suche is her wylde disobedience
and disobedient wyldenesse)
canne by no meanes abide
to submyt her selfe to the rule of
the spirite, but continuallye stryueth
to haue the vpper hand, and
contrarye to gods appoinmente
to make the spirit subiect vnto her
The spirite prouoketh vnto humilitie,
Charitie, Pacience, quyetnesse,
continencye, purenesse of
lyfe, moderate eatynge and drinkinge.
&c. The flesh contrariwise
calleth vnto pride, hautynesse of
mynde, enuye, malice vengaunce
discord, whordō, auoutry, glotoni

dronkenship. &c. So that ther is
a continual con
                     •
                  icte betwene the
spirite & the fleshe▪ who shal haue
the victorye as. S. Paule saieth
If the flesh subdueth the spirite,
then pearyshe wee,Galath. v but if the spirite
accordynge to goddes ordynaunce
beareth rule, and hathe
the fleshe in subieccion, then well
are we. Nowe that thys maye be
broughte to passe, godly & Christen
abstinence shall healp greatlye.Fastynge tameth the flesh.
For there is nothinge that so
tameth and bringeth vnder the
wylde and vnrulye lustes of the
flesh, as fasting and abstinēce, euen
as there is nothing that maketh
a wilde and fearce horsse so
tame and obedyent to his master
as the withdrawing of his haye,
otes, breade, and suche other prouender.
They therefore that wyl

vse theyr faste a ryghte and vnto
a godlye ende, muste fyrste directe
it vnto this purpose, that by
the exercyse thereof they may brydle
the wantonnes of the fleshe,
and refraine theyr bodyes frō sin
that the spirite,i. Pete. iii. whiche is a precious
thinge before God, maye be
quiet, or els all other exercises &
trauails although neuer so painfull,
are vayne. To thys vse serued
the fastes of manye godlye
bothe men and women in tymes
paste, that the bodie beinge mortified,
the spirite might the more
frely attend on God. The prince
like Prophet saieth, I putte on
sacke cloth and humbled my soul
with fasting.Psa. xxxv This holy Prophet
and kinge vsed fastinge to thys
ende, that hee mighte bringe his
bodye lowe and in subieccion to

the spirit, that the vngodli lustes
thereof myghte no more rage &
rule in hym as they dyd,

her husbande to bee slayne

selfe, I chastise and tame my bodye,
and bring it into subieccion,
least bi any means it come to pas
that when I haue preached to other,
I my self shuld be cast awai
These with manye other chastysed
and tamed theyr bodyes with

fastinge, that the spirite myghte
haue free course vnto God and
bee occupyed aboute heauenlye
thynges. After thys manner
oughte all true Christians to do,
that the bodye being kept in subieccion,
the spirite maye rule and
haue the ouerhande, and by no
meanes to follow the wycked maner
of the papists, whych in theyr
fastes abstain frō grosse fleshe, &
deuoure all kynde of deinty and
fine fishe, whiche make theyr bodies
muche more prone to lewdnes,
then the eatyng of flesh, and
also bringeth the spirit into miserable
seruitute & bondage. O vngodlye
manner of fastinge.

be brideled, so muste our bodies

                  r, & waieth in what case it
standeth. For as a mā in a filthye
glas seeth not him selfe such one
as he is in deede, so likewise if he
be ouerladen wyth to muche eatynge

and drinckynge, he thincketh
him selfe to be another manner
of man then he is. Yea then
is hee prouoked vnto sensualilitie
and filthye luste, moued vnto
anger, puffed vp with pride, &
stirred vnto letchery. In respecte
wherof the Apostle sayeth, be not
dronke wyth wyne,

behauioure. But if the body
be kept in order, and accustomed
wyth fastyng, then doth the
soul know the better, with what
deuociō she ought to serue her redemer.
Fastyng therfore is very
necessari. Hereunto pertaineth y•
saying of.In Gene. Home. ix. Why we abstayne from meates. S. Ihon goldē mouth
The abstinence fro meates is receiued
for this purpose, y• it shuld
restrain the rigour & fearsnes of
y• flesh to make it obedient to the
spirit, euē as an horse is to his keper.

For he that fasteth, muste aboue
all thinges refraine anger,
learne mekenes and gentlenes,
haue an hearte contrite, and such
one as may repel and put backe
vncleane concupiscences & lusts
He muste also set before his eies
alway the eye of the euerlastinge
iudge and y• iudgeing place that
canne not be corrupted. Againe
he muste by his monye be made
the better by distributing it to the
pore, & haue rule ouer it. He must
be liberal in geuing almes & receiue
into his hart no euil against
his neighboure,Esay. 
                        〈◊〉
                     
                   as Esaye speaking
in y• persō of god sath: haue
I chosen this fast, sayth the lord?
Thoughe thou wrye aboute thy
necke lyke an hoope, and strowest
vnder the sackeclothe and
ashes, yet wyll not I regard thy
fast saith the lord. What fast thē,

tel me? Losen, saith he, the bonds
of the wicked bargaines, breake
thy breade to the hongry bringe
the pore man that hath no house
into thi house. If thou doest these
these things, saith he, thē shal thy
light breake forth as y• morning
light and thy health shal spryng
right shortly. Hast thou now sene
(my welbeloued) what y• true fast
is? Let vs loke vpō this fast, and
let vs not thincke, as many do, y•
fastinge standeth in this pointe,
if we continewe without any dinner
til it be night. S. Hierome also
saieth: Satietie or fulnes is to
be exchewed euen of y• most vyle
meats. For ther is nothing y• so ouerwhelmeth
y• mind, as a ful bellye.
Thus haue we herd that the
first & principal vse of fastinge is
to tame, chastise, subdue & mortifi

the flesh,A Rule to bee obserued in fastyng. y• it resist not, but rather
obei the rule of y• spirit as an hād
maide, her maistres, or an horsse
hys keper. But this is to be cōsidered
in our fasting, y• we do not
with our vnmeasurable fasts so
make weake & feable the bodye,
that it be hable to serue neyther
God, nor our neighbour, nor yet
our selues, & by this meanes vtterly
quench the vse & workyng
of the spirit, as we rede that many
in times past haue done, such
fasts please not God. This commaūdement
therfore of S Paul
is to be obserued in al our fasts,
Make not prouisiō,Rom. xiii. sayth he, for
the flesh to fulfyl the lustes of it.
An horsse that is to much delicate
lyfed, casteth his master, againe
if he be kept to hongry, he faynteth
in the mids of the iourney, &
doth not his office. A meane therfore

is to be had as in fedinge of
the horsse, so likewise in ordering
of the bodye. We lyue not to eat,
but we eate to lyue.
            
            
               ¶The .xx. Chapter.

For this kind of fasting pleaseth
God greatly, when he seeth that

and so harty compassion toward
our pore neighbour, that we can
not finde in our hearte he shulde
want, yea rather then he shoulde
lacke, we wil spare it out of oure

your selues,Luke. xxi. lest at any time your
herts be ouercom with surfeting
and dronkennes, & cares of thys
lyfe, and so the dai (of iudgemēt)
come on you vnwares. The prophet
Esay thoundereth agaynst
them, which despising this godly
maner of abstinence, set al theyr
minds on bankettyng and belly

there. Wo be vnto thē sayth he:
that rise vp early to folow dronkennes,Esaye. v.
and to them that contynue
so vntyl nyght, and tyll they
be set on fyre wich wine. In those
companies are harps and lutes,
Tabrets and pipes & wyne. But
they regard not y• work of ye lord.
Agayne he saythe: Wo be vnto
thē yt are strong to sup out wyne,
& expert mē to set vp dronkēnes.
These giue sentence with the vngodly
for rewards, but cōdemne
the iust cause of the ryghteouse.
Therfore like as fyre licketh vp
the straw, and as the flame consumeth
the stuble, euen so theyr
roote shalbe as corrupcion, and
theyr blossom shal vanysh away
like dust, for they haue cast awai
the law of the Lord of hosts, and
blasphemed the word of the holy,
maker of Israel. From beastly

bāketting vnto faithful fastīg
& contynual calling on the name
of the Lord doth the prophet Ioel
cal these belly goddes, saying,
Wake vpye drōckards & weepe
mourne al ye wine bibbers,Ioel. i. & not
without a cause. For he yt hath his
bodye loden wyth meat & drinke

the godly men did euer take any
great thing in hand, except they
first fasted. So oft as they wēt about
to obtain any thing of God,
they fasted, & wept, and watched
whole nightes in praier, & weare
garmentes of heare next to their
flesh, & so withal humblenes, desired
god to be benificial to thē. Nether
wanted they of their purpose
whē they most hūbly fel down at
the fete of god & offered vnto him
the sacrifice of a contrite hart, but
god was neare vnto them, yt called
on him, & reached forthe hys
hand to them yt wer in daunger, &
holpe thē that wer in trouble. Again
he saieth, praier is of great
vertue, whē fasting goeth afore.

on the whych the people shoulde
resorte and come together vnto
the temple for to praye vnto the
Lord God. And that they myght
come the more deuoutely & pray
wyth the greater fruite, they appointed
also that the daye before
the solemne feast, they shuld fast
that they myght be the more apt
to pray, whē they come together
into the temple.Note. For wher the body
is burdened wyth meate, ther
the mynde can haue no free passage
vnto God. Let thē therfore
that fast, appointe their fastynge
also to thys vse, that by theyr abstinence
they may be the more re

pray, & not only to prepare them
selues to pray, but also earnestly
to gyue theyr mindes vnto praier,
or els what doth theyr fast profit
them? To faste from meat and
to goo about worldlye matters,
what other thing is it, then a mockinge
of God, & a derision of christen
abstinence as .S.Ambrose. Ambrose
saith, doest yu thincke yt he fasteth
aright, whiche waking betymes
in the morning goeth not vnto y•
church (to prai & to hear the word
of god) but as sone as he is vp, gathereth
together hys seruauntes
laieth abrode his nets, bryngeth
forth his dogs, & goeth running
about the forestes? Therefore if
we faste, lette vs faste a ryghte,
and after the examples of the aū
                  cyente
holye fathers lette vs alwaye
couple prayer wyth our fastinge.
So shall boothe we, oure

fastes & our praiers please God.
