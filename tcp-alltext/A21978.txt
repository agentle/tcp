                  FOraſmuch as the infection of the Plague is at this preſent greatly increaſed
and diſperſed aſwell in the Cities of London and Weſtminſter, as
alſo in the Suburbs thereof, The Kings moſt Excellent Maieſtie conſidering
that great perill and danger might inſue, not onely vnto his Royall
perſon, the Queenes Maieſtie, the Prince, and Princeſſe, the Honourable
Embaſſadors from ſundry forreine Princes, the Lords and others of his
Maieſties Honourable Priuie Counſell, the Nobles of this Realme, and
other his Maieſties louing Subiects, if the people of all ſorts, and out of all parts of this Realme,
ſhould reſort or continue together for their Suits and Cauſes this inſtant Terme, commonly called
Trinitie Terme, and hoping that by diſperſing of the multitude of people now being in or about his ſaid
Cities, and by ſtaying the acceſſe of others to the ſame about Suits in Law, and by due obſeruation
of ſuch good and neceſſary Orders and directions, as are and ſhall bee preſcribed in that behalfe,
through the mercifull goodneſſe of Almighty God, the ſaid infection ſhalbe ſtayed, ſo as the Coronation
and Inauguration of his moſt Excellent Maieſtie, to the ineſtimable and vniuerſall reioycing
of all his louing and true hearted Subiects, with all Princely ſolemnities and Honors thereunto apperteyning,
may be accompliſhed and performed, at ſuch time and place as his Maieſty hath already
bene pleaſed to appoint, Hath therefore thought good by the aduice of his Priuie Councell, and Iuſtices
of his Courts at Weſtminſter, to adiorne part of the ſame Terme, That is to ſay, in and from
the ſecond Returne of this inſtant Terme, commonly called Octabis Trinitatis, vntill the fourth Returne
of the ſame Terme, commonly called Tres Trinitatis, and that to be for ſuch cauſes onely, and for
ſuch intent and purpoſe, as hereafter is declared.
            And therefore his Maieſtie doeth hereby ſignifie and declare, that his Will and pleaſure is, That
Writts of Adiornement ſhalbe directed to the Iuſtices of either Bench, and to the Iudges of all
other his Maieſties Courts, to whom like Writts haue bene vſually directed, giuing them authoritie
to adiorne this inſtant Terme, in and from Octabis Trinitatis next, vntill Tres Trinitatis then next following,
And the ſaid Adiornement to be made the firſt day of the ſayd Octabis Trinitatis, called the
day of Eſſoines.
            And whereas his Maieſty conſidering in his princely wiſedome what great preiudice might grow
to many his good & louing Subiects in their Cauſes and Suits, if this Terme ſhould be wholly adiourned,
Hath therefore by the aduice of his ſayd Counſell and Iuſtices, determined to haue ſome
part thereof to be holden and continued for ſome few dayes in the beginning and ending of the ſame,
as is aforeſayd, His Highneſſe moſt gracious intention in that behalfe is, That the ſame dayes for
which ſome part of this ſaid Terme is to be holden, ſhalbe vſed only for the better expediting and continuing
of Cauſes and Suits, and returning and ſuing out of Proceſſe, and for ſuch other like things,
which may be performed and done in the abſence of the parties by their Attourneyes. And therefore
his Maieſtie doth by this his Proclamation ſignifie to all his louing Subiects, that his will and
pleaſure is, That in and from the ſaid Octabis Trinitatis next, there ſhal not be any Trials by Iuries,
or any Iudgments vpon Demurrers, or ſpecial Verdicts or ſuch like, in any of his Highneſſe Courts
of Kings Bench, Common Pleas, or Exchequer. And alſo that there ſhal not be any Iudicial hearing
or determining of any Cauſes or Matters in any of his Maieſties Courts of Starre Chamber,
Chancerie, Exchequer Chamber, Court of Wards, Duchie Chamber, or Court of Requeſts, in or

from the ſaid Octabis Trinitatis next, during the ſaid Terme: And that no partie ſhall need to be preſent
in perſon for any ſuch Cauſes or Suites, but the ſame may bee attended and done by their
Attourneys.
            And his Maieſtie doth hereby further notifie and declare, That no party ſhall be compelled or
need to appeare in perſon in any of his Maieſties ſayd Courts, in or from the ſayd Octabis Trinitatis
next, at any time during this ſaid Terme, but may make their apparance by their Attourneys, ſauing
only in Caſes of Outlawry, and other the Caſes mentioned in the Prouiſo hereafter following:
And alſo that no Iuries or any whom the ſame may concerne, ſhall be compelled or need to appeare
in any of his Highneſſe Courts at Weſtminſter in or from the ſayd Octabis Trinitatis next, at any time
during the ſayd Terme for any cauſe or matter whatſoeuer, vnleſſe it be for ſome ſpeciall and important
cauſe for his Maieſties ſeruice onely.
            Prouided neuertheleſſe, and his Maieſties pleaſure and commandement is, That all Collectors,
Receiuers, Sheriffes, and other Accomptants, & all other perſons that ſhould or ought to accompt
or pay any ſumme or ſummes of mony in any of his Maieſties Courts of Exchequer, Court of Wards
and Liueries, or of his Duchy of Lancaſter, or in any of them, or enter into any accompt in any of
the ſayd Courts, ſhall repayre to the accuſtomed places at Weſtminſter, and there to pay and doe in
euery behalfe as though no ſuch Proclamation or Adiournement had bene had or made.
            And his Maieſties further pleaſure and commandement is, That all Sheriffes ſhall returne into
his Maieſties Court of Exchequer, Court of Wards and Liueries, and Duchy of Lancaſter, all
manner of Writs and Proceſſe iſſued out of the ſame Courts, and returnable this Tearme, which
in any ſort concerne his Maieſties Reuenewes, Debts, or Duties, at or before the dayes of Returnes
thereof, into ſuch Offices from whence the ſaid Writs and Proceſſe did iſſue: And that all Commiſſioners
likewiſe returne all manner of Commiſſions and Inquiſitions returnable this Tearme, and
from the ſaid Courts ſent, whereby his Maieſtie is to receiue profit and commoditie: And all Sheriffes,
Collectors, all manner of Accomptants, and euery perſon that is to pay any kind of Debt or
Duety vnto the Kings Maieſtie in any of the ſaid Courts, doe either by themſelues, their Deputies,
or Attourneys, pay the ſame in ſuch ſort as they ought to haue done if no ſuch Proclamation or Adiournement
had beene made, or elſe to ſuſtaine ſuch damage of Iſſues, Seaſure, Fine, Amerciament,
and Penaltie to be impoſed vpon them, as hath beene accuſtomed, without any hope to be diſcharged
thereof: And that all Sheriffes, by themſelues or their ſufficient Deputies, ſhall giue their
attendance at the day appointed for their oppoſall in the Court of Exchequer, to anſwere their Returnes
before his ſayd Barons, as hath beene heretofore accuſtomed: And if any default ſhall be
made by any of the perſons aforeſaid, that then in reſpect of the Kings preſent neceſſary and extraordinary
charges, Sergeants at Armes and Purſuiuants ſhalbe ſent to bring them vp to anſwer their
contempt and ſlackneſſe in payment.
            
               Giuen at our Manour of Greenewich the three and twentieth day of Iune, in the firſt yeere of
our Reigne of England, France, and Ireland, and the ſixe and thirtieth of Scotland.
               
God ſaue the King.
