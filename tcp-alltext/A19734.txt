OF S. CYPRIAN

Lordes

            AN. M. D. XXXIX.

I dedicate vnto you,

            The Sermon of saynte Cyprian
made on the Pater noster.
            
               THE PRECEP
               tes
of the Gospell
moste louynge bretherne,
are none other
thing, than diuine
techinges, the
foundacions of edifyenge hope,
the sure groundes of fortifyenge
faith, the nourysshmentes to cheryshe
the harte, the stere to directe
our iourney, and the firme defences
to opteyne saluation, whiche
preceptes whyle they instructe in
erthe the apte myndes of the beleuers,
they bryng them to the kingdome
of heuen. Goddis wyl was,
that many thynges shuld be both
spoken and harde by the prophetes
his seruantes: but how farre

greatter are those thynges, that
the sonne speketh, which the word
of god, that was in the prophetes,
witnesseth with his owne voyce?
not nowe commaunding, that the
waye be made redy for hym commyng:
but commynge hym selfe,
and openynge and shewing to vs
the way, that we, that fyrste were
blynd and wandryng in the darknes
of deathe, beinge illumyned
with the grace of his lyghte,Psalm. 5. and
he beinge our leder and gide, may
holde on our iourney to lyfe: whiche
among other his helthful monitiōs
and diuine preceptes, with
whiche he allureth his people to
saluation, he also gaue a forme of
prayer, he monyshed and instructed
what we shulde pray. He that
made vs to lyue, taughte vs also
to pray, this dyd he of his benignitie,

whereby he vouchesaued to
gyue and conferre other thynges,
that whyle we in prayer and oryson,
that the son taught vs, speke
to the father, we may be the soner
hard. He than tolde vs before, the
howre commeth, whan the trewe
worshyppers, shulde worshyp the
father in spirite and trouthe, and
hath fulfylled that he before promysed,
that we, which of his sancctification
haue receyued spyrite
and trouthe, of his tradition also
shall truely and spiritually pray.
For what prayer can be more spiritual
than that, that is gyuen vs
of Christe, frome whome also the
holy ghoste is sente to vs? What
prayer maye do more with the father,
than that, that the son, whiche
is the veritie spake with his
owne mouthe? in soo moche that

to praye otherwyse than he hathe
taught, is not onely ignoraunce,
but also offence,Matth. 15. seinge he hath set
forthe, and sayde, Ye caste asyde
the commandement of god, to the
ende you wolde stablysshe youre
own tradition. Therfore dere brethern,
let vs pray, as god our master
hath taught vs. It is a frendly
and familyar oryson, to praye
god of his owne, the prayer of
Christe to ascend to his eares, the
father wyll acknowlege the wordes
of his sonne. Whan we make
our prayer, lette hym that dwelleth
within the breaste be in the
voyce. And seynge that we haue
hym as an aduocate to the father
for our synnes, whan we synners
pray for our offences, let vs bring
forth the wordis of our aduocate.
For syth he saith:Ioan. 1 What so euer ye

wylle desyre of the father in my
name, he shall gyue it you: than
howe moch more effectually shall
we obteyn that we axe in Christis
name, if we craue it with his own
prayer? But suche as woll praye,
let their wordis & prayer be lowly
quiete and honest. Let vs thinke,
that we stand in the syght of god.
The diuine eyes must be pleased
bothe with the behauyour of the
body, and maner of speche. For as
it is an imprudent poynt, to make
a clamorous noyse, so cōtrarywise
it is conuenient, shamefastely to
praye with sober and temperate
prayers. Furthermore the lorde
commandeth vs secretely to pray
in priuie, secrete, or out places, ye
in oure bedde chaumbers, whiche
thynge dothe greately agree with
our fayth, to thende that we shuld

knowe God to be presente euerye
where, to here and see vs all, and
with the fulnesse of his maiestie,
also to perse and enter into secret
and hydde places, as it is writen,
I am god drawyng nere,Hier. 23. and nat
god afarre of. If a man were hid
in priuie and secrete places, ergo
shall nat I see hym? Do not I fyl
both heuen and erth?Pro. 15. And ageyn,
The eies of god do beholde in euery
place bothe the good & bad.
Whan we com togyther with our
brethern, and do celebrate diuine
sacrifyces with goddis mynister,
the prieste, we must be myndefull
of shamefastnesse and dyscipline,
not to blaste abrode our prayers,
with vnordered voyces, nor oure
petition, soberly to be commended
to god, we shuld cast out with tumustuouse
ianglynge, for god hereth

the harte, and not the voyce.
Nor we shoulde crye out to hym,
whyche seeth oure thoughtes, the
lord prouokyng and saying,Luc. 5. what
thynke you wyckednesse in youre
hartis? and in an other place.Hier. 17. And
let all congregations knowe, that
I am the sercher of the rainis and
harte. Whiche thyng Anna in the
fyrst boke of kynges, bearing the
figure of the church, obseruid and
kepte, whyche not with a clamorous
peticion, but styll and softly
within the pryuye partes of her
breast, prayd vnto the lorde. She
spake with a hyd prayer, but with
an open fayth: she spake not with
voyce, but with harte, for soo she
knewe god herde, and she obteyned
effectuallye that she desyred,
bycause she axed faythfully. Holy
scripture declareth what she sayd:

She spake in her harte,1. Reg. 1. and her
lippes moued, and her voyce was
not harde, and god herd her. Also
we rede in the psalmes:Psalm. 4. Speke in
your hartes, and in your beddes,
and remember your selfis. By Ieremye
also, the same thynges the
holy ghooste dothe perswade and
teache, sayenge:Hier. 29. It behoueth the
to praye to god inwardelye. But
yet well beloued brethern, he that
dothe pray, shuld not forget, after
what maner in the temple the publycane
prayed with the pharisee,
his eies not vnsemely lifted vp to
heuen, nor his handes insolently
stratched out, knocking his brest,
and acknowlegynge his secrete &
hydden synnes, lamentably desyred
succour of goddis meecy. But
seinge the Pharisee stoode in his
owne conceite, this man deserued

more to be sāctified, which so praied,
that he had no hope of saluation
in his innocēcy, sythe no man
is innocente, but confessynge his
synnes, he humbly prayde, and he
that forgyueth the humble, harde
his prayer: The whiche thinges
the lord in his gospel putteth and
sayth:Luc. 18. Two men went vp into the
temple to pray, the one a pharisee,
and the other a Publycane: The
pharisee stode, and prayed by him
self after this maner: God I thāk
the, bicause I am nat as other mē
vniuste, robbers, adulterers, as
this publycane. I faste twyse in
the weke, I gyue the tythes of al
what so euer I possesse. But the
publycane stoode afarre of, and
wolde not lyfte vp his eies to heuen,
but knockid his brest, saying
God be mercyfull vnto me a synner.

I telle you this manne went
downe moore iustyfyed into his
hous, thē he the pharisee.
                  
                     ••
                  th. 23. For who
so euer exalteth hym selfe, shall be
humbled, and who so euer wolle
humble hym selfe, shalbe exalted.
Whiche thynges dere bretherne,
we lerning of the diuine lesson, after
that we knowe how we ought
to ꝓcede to praier, we must know
alsoo, the lorde instructynge vs,
what we shulde pray, thus saythe
he, praye ye.
            Our father, whiche art in heuen, halowed
be thy name.
            Thy kyngedome come.
            Thy wyl be done in erth, as it is in heuen.
            Gyue vs this day our dayly breade.
            And forgyue vs our trespaces, as we forgyue
them that trespas agaynst vs.
            And let vs not be ledde into temptation.
            But delyuer vs from euyll. Amen.
            
               Aboue all thynges, the teacher
of peace, and mayster of vnitie,
wyl not singular & priuate prayer
to be made, that whā any prayeth
yt he shuld not onely pray for hym
selfe, We say nat, My father, whiche
art in heuen, nor Gyue me my
dayly bread. Nor there is no man
that desyreth to haue his synnes
forgyuen hym aloone, or prayeth
for hym selfe alone, that he shulde
nat be led into temptation, and delyuered
from euyl. Our prayer is
publyke and common, and whan
we pray, we pray not for one, but
for all the people, for we all be but
one. The lorde of peace and mayster
of concorde, whiche taughte
vnitie, wolde oone to pray soo for
all, as he hym selfe bare al in one.
This rule of prayer, the thre childern
inclosed in the forneis of fire

obserued, agreing and accordyng
in prayer and consente of spirite.
Whiche thynge the trouthe of diuine
scripture declareth, & whan
it teacheth howe they prayd, it giueth
example, whiche in our praiers,
we ought to folowe, that we
may be suche as they were.Daniel. 5. Than
(sayth, the scripture) they thre as
out of one mouth, sang an himne,
and blessed the lorde. They spake
as out of oone mouthe, and yet
Christe had not tought theym to
pray, and therfore to theym prayinge,
their wordes were effectuall
and toke place, for their peasyble,
symple, and spirituall prayer, deserued
to be accepted of god. And
so we fynd, that the apostels with
the disciples prayid after thascention
of the lorde.Act. 1. They were all,
sayth the scripture, of one mynde,

and continuynge in prayer, with
the womē, and Mary the mother
of Iesu, and with his bretherne.
They being of one mynde perseuered
in prayer, declaryng bothe
the instance and concorde of their
prayer. For god whyche maketh
the inhabitantes of one mynde in
the house,Psal. 67. admitteth none into the
diuine and eternall house, but suche
as are of one mynd in prayer.
But what be the misteries of the
lordis prayer, most dere brethern,
how many, how great, how brefely
gathered togither, but in vertue
spirituall, howe copious and
abundant? that there is nothing
omittid, that is not in our praiers
and orysons, comprysed in this
compendiouse heauenly doctrine.
Thus sayth he, pray ye,Matth. 6. 
               Our father
whiche arte in heauen, The man that

is renewed and borne ageyn, and
restored to god by his grace, sayth
in the fyrst place, Father, bycause he
begynneth nowe to be his sonne.
He came (sayth the scripture) into
his owne,Ioan. 1. and his owne receyued
hym not, But as many as receyued
hym, to theym gaue he power
to be the chylderne of god, which
beleue in his name. Therfore he
that beleueth in his name, and is
made the chyld of god, must forth
withall begyn both to gyue thankes,
and acknowlege him selfe to
be the chylde of god, whan he nameth
his father to be in heauen,
god. He woll also among the first
wordes of his byrthe declare hym
selfe, to haue forsaken his erthely
and carnall father, and to begyn
to haue hym his only father, that
is in heuen, as it is writen: They

that say to the father and mother,
I knowe the not, & they acknowleged
not their children, they haue
kepte thy preceptes, and haue obserued
thy testamēt.Matt. 23. Also the lord
in his gospel commaundeth, that
we shulde calle no man father in
erthe, bycause we haue one father
whiche is in heuen. And to the disciple,
that shewid, that his father
was deade, he sayde:Matth. 8. Suffre the
deade to burye the deade. For he
sayde, that his father was deed:
sythen they that beleue, haue a lyuynge
father. Nor we ought not
dere bretherne, to marke and consyder
this onely, that we shuld cal
hym father that is in heauen, but
we ioyne therwith, and say, Oure
father, that is of them that beleue
of thē that by hym bd sauctifyed,
and with the natiuite of spiritual

grace restored, beganne to be the
chyldren of god. Whyche voyce
also doothe wrynge and sharpely
touche the Iewes, whych not only
vnfaythfully despised Christe,
forshewed to them by the prophetes,
and to them fyrst sent, but also
cruelly slewe hym. The whiche
Iewes can nat nowe call god father,
sythen the lord confoundeth
and reproueth them, sayeng:Ioan. 8. You
are of the father the dyuelle: and
after the lustes of your father wyl
ye do, for he was a murderer frō
the begynnynge, and abode not in
the truthe: bycause the truthe is
not in hym. And by EsaieEsay. 1. the prophete
god disdaynyng crieth out:
I haue begottē chyldren, and exalted
them, but they haue despised
me. The oxe knowith is lord, &
the asse his masters stable, but Israell

knoweth not, and my people
hath not vnderstand, out vpon ye
synfull nation, people full of synnes,
wycked seede, vngracyouse
childerne. you haue forsaken the
lorde, and haue prouoked him the
holy one of Israel to indignatiō.
            To whose rebuke and shaame,
whan we Christians pray, we say,
Our father. bycause he hath begon
to be ours, and hath lefte to be the
Iewes father, which forsoke him.
Nor a synfulle people can nat be
his chylde, but they, whose synnes
are forgyuen, be callyd chylderne,
and to theym euerlastynge
ioye is promysed, oure lorde hym
selfe sayenge:Ioan. 8. Who so euer dothe
synne, is the seruant, of synne, as
for the seruant, abydeth not in the
house foreuer, but the sonne abydeth
for euer. But howe greate is

the gentylnesse of the lorde? howe
plentiful is his fauour & goodnes
towarde vs? That so wolde haue
vs celebrate our prayer in goddis
sight, that we shuld cal god, fader
and that as Christ is the sonne of
god, so we also shoulde be cleped
the chyldren of god. Which name
none of vs durste ones touche in
prayer, but if he had permitted vs
soo to praye. Therfore deere bretherne,
we ought to remēbre and
knowe, that whan we cal god, father,
we oughte to behaue vs as
children of god, that as we take a
pleasure to haue god our father,
so he maye be pleased to haue vs
his chyldren: we shoulde behaue
vs as the temples of god, that it
myght appere, that god dwelleth
in vs. Ne our dedes shoulde not
vary from the spirit, that we that

haue begunne to be heuenly and
spirituall, shulde thynke nor doo
but heuenly and spiritualle thynges.
For god hym selfe saythe:1. Reg. 2. I
wyll glorifie theym, that glorifie
me, and he that despiseth me, shal
be despised.1. Cor. 6. Also the blessed apostel
in his epistell sayth: ye are not
your owne, for ye be bought with
a great price: glorifie and beare
god in your body.
            ¶After this we saye, Halowed be
thy name, not that we desyre of god
that his name shulde be halowed
by oure prayers, but we aske of
him, that his name maye be halowed
in vs. For of whome is god
sanctified, whiche hym selfe sanctifieth
other? but bicause he saith
Be ye holy,Leuit. 20. for I am holy, therfore
we desyre and pray, that we, that
are sanctified in baptysme, maye

perseruer & abyde in that we haue
begun: and this daily we pray for.
            For truly we had nede to be dayly
sanctified, that we, whiche synne
dayly, might pourge our synnes
with continuall fanctifycation.
            But what this sanctification is,
that god vouchsafeth to giue vs,
the apostelle declareth,2 Cor. 6. sayienge:
Nother fornicatours, nor Idoll
worshippers, nor brekers of wedlocke,
nor weakelynges, nor abusers
of them selfes with mākynd,
nor theues, nor the couetous, nor
drunkardes, nor sclanderers, nor
cursed speakers, nor extorcioners
shall inheryte the kyngedome of
god. And suche haue you ben, but
ye be washed, ye ar made rightuous,
ye are sanctified in the name
of oure lorde Iesu Christe, and in
the spirite of our god. He saythe,

we be sāctified in the name of our
lorde Iesu Christe, and in the spirite
of our god. That this sanctification
shulde remayne in vs, we
pray: and bycause god our iudge
menasseth the healed and the relyued
of hym, to sinne no more now
leste he shulde be worse handled,
we make this continuall prayer,
this we craue bothe daye & night,
that the sanctification and viuificatiō,
that is goten by the grace
of god, might be kept by his protection.
            There foloweth in this prayer,
Thy kyngdome come. We desyre also,
that his kyngedome be represented
vnto vs, lykewyse as we
aske that his name maye be halowed
in vs. For whanne doth not
god reigne? or whan begynneth
his reigne, which alway was, and

euer shalbe? We desyre our kyngdome
to come, of god to vs promysed,
and with the bloudde and
passion of Christ gotten, that we,
which before serued in the world,
may afterward reigne with Christ
rulyng, lyke as he promyseth and
sayth:Mat. 25. Come ye blessed of my father,
take and receyue the kyngedome,
whiche is prepared for you
from the beginnyng of the world.
Truely it may be, dere bretherne,
that Christ hym selfe is the kyngdome
of god, whiche dayly we desyre
to come: whose commyng we
couete soone to se. For seyng that
he is oure resurrection, and that
we ryse agayn in him: so likewise
he may be vnderstande the kyngdome
of god. For in hym we shall
reigne.Heauenly and erthly kyngdom. And we do well, to desyre
the kyngdome of god, that is,

the kyngdom of heuen. For there
is also an erthely kyngdome. But
he that now forsaketh the worlde,
is greatter than the honours and
kyngedome therof: and therfore
he that dedicateth hym self to god
and Christe, desyreth not the erthly,
but the heauenly kyngdome.
We had nede to pray cōtinually,
leste we falle frome the heauenly
kyngedome, as the Iewes dyd, to
whom it was fyrste promysed, as
oure lorde hym selfe manyfestely
proueth:Matth. 8. Many (saythe he) shall
come from the easte and west, and
shall reste with Abraham, Isaac,
and Iacob, in the kyngedome of
heuen. But the chylderne of the
kyngedome shall be caste out into
vtter darknesse, there shalbe wailynge
and gnashynge of tethe. He
sheweth this, bycause the Iewes

were afore chylderne of the kyngdome,
as longe as they continued
to be the chyldren of god. But after
the name of the father ceassed
amonge them, theyr kyngedome
ceassed withall. And therfore we
christians, whiche in our prayer
haue begonne to call god, father:
do also praye, that the kyngedom
of god may come to vs.
            ¶We adde therto and saye, Thy
wyll be done in erthe, as it is in heuen,
not that god shuld do that he wol,
but that we may do that god wol.
For who withstandeth god, but
that he may do what he wol? But
bycause the dyuelle withstandeth
vs, that our myndes in all thynges,
and in euery act obeyeth nat
god, we praye and desyre that the
wylle of god maye be done in vs,
whiche to the ende it may be done

in vs, we haue nede of Goddes
wyll, that is, of goddis helpe and
protection: for no man is stronge
of him selfe: but is sure and safe
by the indulgence and mercye of
god. For god declaryng the infirmitie
of man, whiche he bare himselfe,
sayth:Matt. 26 Father, if it be possible,
let this cuppe passe from me.
And gyuynge an exaumple to his
disciples, that they shulde not do
theyr owne, but goddis wylle, he
added therto sayinge: Neuerthelesse,
not as I wylle, but as thou
wylte. And in an nother place he
saythe:Ioan. 6. I discended not from heuen
to do myn owne wyll, but his
that sente me. If that the sonne
was obedient to doo the fathers
wyll: Howe moche more oughte
the seruaunt to be obedient to do
goddis wyll;1. Ioan. 2 Saynte Iohū alsoo

lykewyse in hys epistle exhortethe
and instructeth vs to do the wylle
of god, sayenge: Se that ye loue
not the world, neither the thinges
that are in the world. If any man
loue the world, the loue of the father
is nat in hym. For all that is
in the worlde, is the luste of the
fleshe, the luste of the eies, and the
pryde of lyfe, whyche is not of the
father, but of the concupiscence of
the worlde, and the world passeth
awaye, and the luste therof. But
he that doth the wyll of god, abydeth
for euer, lyke as god abydeth
for euer. We that woll abyde for
euer, must fulfyl the wyll of god,
whiche is eternalle. The wylle of
god is, which Christ both taught
and fulfilled: humilitie in conuersation,
stablenesse in feyth, myldnes
in wordes, ryghtousenesse in

dedes, mercy in workes, discipline
in maners, not to knowe to do iniurie,
and to suffre wronge done,
to lyue quietly amonge brethern,
to loue god with all the harte, to
loue hym bycause he is the father
to feare hym bycause he is god, to
esteme nothynge aboue Chryste,
for he estemed nothing aboue vs,
to cleaue to his charitie inseparably,
& to sticke to his crosse strongly
and faythefullye, whan for his
name and honoure there is anye
stryfe: to shewe constancy in wordes,
that we confesse hym with:
and sure truste in question, wherwith
we assayle other: pacience in
dethe, wherto we contende, this is
to wylle to be heire wyth Chryste,
this is to do goddis commaundement,
this is to fulfyll the wyll of
the father. We desyre the wylle of

god to be done in erthe as it is in
heuen: bothe whiche apperteyne
to the consummation of our wyll
and saluation. For sythen we possesse
a body of the erth, and a gost
of heuen, we be erthe and heuen,
and in bothe, that is, bodye and
gooste, we praye, that the wyll of
god be doone. Trewely there is a
wrastlyng betwene the fleshe and
the spirite, and stryuinge oone ageynste
the other, they dayly contende
together, that we canne not
doo the thynges that we wolde:
while the spirite seketh for heuenly
and diuine thynges, the fleshe
coueiteth erthly and worldly thinges.
And therfore we ernestly desyre,
that betweene these two, by
the ayde and helpe of god, agreement
may be made, that whan the
wylle of god is fulfylled bothe of

the spirite and the fleshe, the soule
whiche by hym is borne agayne,
may be saued. Whych thynge the
apostel Paule playne and openly
declareth with his owne voyce:
The fleshe (saythe he) lusteth agaynste
the spirite, and the spirite
agaynst the fleshe. These two are
so contrarye one to the other, that
you can not do what thinges that
ye wolde.Galat. 5. The dedes of the fleshe
be manyfeste, whiche are, adulteries,
fornications, vnclennes, fylthy
wantonnesse, idolatry, witch-craft,
murder, hatred, contention,
spite, wrath, prouocation, debate,
heresye, enuye, dronkennes, glottony,
and suche lyke, which I tell
you before, as I haue tolde you,
that they whiche do such thinges,
shall not possesse the kyngedome
of god. But the fruit of the spirite

is Charitie, ioye, peace, long sufferynge,
feythe, mekenesse, continence,
chastite. And therfore daily
yea continually we praye, that the
wyll of god be done concernynge
vs, bothe in heauen and in erthe,
For this is the wylle of god, that
erthely thynges shuld gyue place
to heuenly, and that spiritual and
diuine thynges, shulde preuayle.
It may also be thus vnderstande
dere bretherne: that bycause god
commandeth, ye and monyssheth
vs to loue our ennemies, and also
to pray for them that ꝑsecute vs,
we shulde praye for them that be
as yet erthy, and haue not yet begun
to be heuenly, that touchyng
them the wyl of god may be done,
whiche Christ fully dyd, in cōseruynge
and renewynge man. For
sythen he called his disciples not

erthy,Matth. 5. but the salte of the erth,1. Cor. 15. and
the apostell calleth the fyrste man
of slyme of the erthe, erthy, the seconde
of heauen, heauenly: with
good cause we, whiche oughte to
be lyke god the father, that maketh
his sonne to ryse vppon the
good and bad,Matth. 5. and sendeth rayne
vpon the iuste and vniuste, shulde
so praye and desyre (god admonishynge)
that we myghte make
prayer for the helthe of all men.
That lyke as in heuen, that is, in
vs by our faythe, the wylle of god
is done, that as we shuld be of heuen,
so euē in erth, that is in them
beleuynge, the wyll of god maye
be done, that they, whiche as yet
of theyr fyrste byrthe, be erthye,
borne of water and the holy goost
may begynne to be heuenly.
            ¶Procedyng forth in our prayer

we aske and say: Gyue vs this daye
our dayly breade, whiche saieng may
be vnderstād spiritually and simply:
for bothe the vnderstandynges
with diuine vtilitie, profytte
vnto saluation. For the breade of
lyfe is Christ, and this is not euery
mans breadde, but it is oures.
And lyke as we saye, our Father by
cause it muste be vnderstande, he
is father of theym that beleue: so
we cal hym our bread.Luc. 14. For Christ,
whose bodye we touche, is oure
breade. This bread we aske dayly
to be gyuen vs, leste we, that be
in Christe, and receyue dayly his
precious body, by some greuouser
offence chaunsynge, whyle we be
accursed out of the churche, & not
communicating,Matth. 6. shulde be prohybited
from that heuenly breadde,
and shulde be separated from the

body of Christe, hym selfe before
shewyng and monysshynge:Iohan. 6. I
am the breade of lyfe that descended
from heuen. he that woll eate
of this breade, shall lyue for euer.
The breade that I woll gyue for
the lyfe of the world, is my fleshe.
Therfore whan he saythe,Eodem. he that
woll eate of this bread, shall lyue
for euer, it is than manyfest, they
lyue, whiche touche his body, and
receyue it by the right of communion:
soo contrarywyse it is to be
feared and prayed for, leste while
one accursed out of the churche, is
separated from the body of Christ
he remayne farre from saluation,
hym self thretnynge and saying,
Excepte ye eate the flesshe of the
sonne of man,Eodem. & drynke his bloud,
ye shall haue no lyfe in you. And
therfore we aske daily our breade,

that is, Chryst to be gyuen to vs,
that we, that abyde and lyue in
Chryste, shulde not departe from
his sanctification and body.
            It may also be thus vnderstād,
that we, whiche haue forsaken the
wolde, and by grace of spirituall
feythe, haue caste away the riches
and pompe therof, woll desyre onlye
oure meate and foode, seinge
Chryst woll vouchsafe to instruct
vs and saye:Luc. 14. He that woll not forsake
all that he hath, canne not be
my disiple. He that hathe begūne
to be Christis disciple, forsakynge
all that he hath, after the wordes
of his mayster, ought to aske his
daily foode: ne we may nat extend
the desyres of our petition to any
longe tyme.Matth. 6. For Christ ageyn prescribeth
and saith: Be not ye careful
for the morowe: for the morow

shall care for it selfe. Euery daye
hath inough of his own trauaile.
Therfore Chrystis dysciple skylfully
asketh his dayly foode: whiche
is prohibited to be carefull for
the morowe. For it is bothe contrarye
and repugnant in it selfe,
that we shuld desyre to lyue longe
in this worlde, whiche prayer, that
the kingedome of god may quickly
come. And so the blessed apostel
monisheth, forinynge & strengththyng
the stedfastnes of our hope
and faithe:1. Timo. 6 Nothynge (sayth he)
we brought into the worlde, aud
truely we can carye nothyng out.
Therfore hauyng foode and rayment,
let vs be content therwih.
For they that woll be ryche, falle
into the temptation and snares of
the dyuell, and into many noysom
lustes, which drowne a man into

distruction and damnation. For
couetousnes is the roote of all yuels:
whiche, some moch desiring,
haue rounne to wrecke frome the
faythe, and tangled theym selfes
with many sorowes. He teacheth
not onely, that ryches shoulde be
despised, but also that they be peryllous,
and that in theym is the
rote of blandysshinge yuelles, the
blyndnes of mans mynde, begyling
with priuie deceyt. Wherfore
Christe reprouynge the foolysshe
ryche man, that had set his mynde
on his worldly substance, & reioyced
in him self for the great abundance
of his fruites, saythe in the
gospell:Luce. 12. Thou foole, this nyghte
shall they require thy soule frome
the, than whose shall those thynges
be that thou haste prepared?
The fole that shuld dye the same

nyght, reioysed in his fruites, and
he, whose lyfe nowe fayled, was
carefull for abundance of foode.
But Christe teacheth a contrarye
lesson,Matth. 19 that he that wol be perfect,
muste selle a way all that he hath,
and deale it amonge poore men,
and make hym a tresure in heuen.
This man (saith Christ) foloweth
him, and the glorie of his passion,
whiche is expedite and lyght apparayled,
not wrapped and loded
with householde stuffe, but leuse
and at lybertie, his goodes and
substāce sent afore to god, he also
foloweth after. To the which that
eche of vs may p̄pare him selfe, he
lerneth vs to pray, & to knowe after
what maner our prayer ought
to be. For no ryghtous man can
lacke his dayely foode,Prou. 10. sythe it is
written: The lorde kylleth not the

soule of a iuste man with hunger.Psal. 38.
And agayne: I haue ben yonger,
and nowe am olde: and haue nat
sene the iuste man forsakē, nor his
sede seke theyr breadde.Matth. 6. Also the
lorde promyseth and saythe: Be
not ye carefull, sayeng: what shall
we eate, or what shall we drinke,
or wherwith shall we be clothed?
For those thinges the hethen people
seke. But your heuenly father
knowethe, that ye haue neede of
those thynges. Seke ye fyrst the
kyngedome of god, and the rightuousnes
therof, & all these thinges
shall be ministred vnto you.
To them that seke the kyngdome
and rightuousnes of god, al those
thynges he promyseth to be ministred.
For sythen all thynges be
goddes, he that hath god, lacketh
nothynge, yf he hym selfe be not

wantyng to god.Deute. 14 So for Daniel,
by the kynges commaundemente
inclosed in the lyons denne, a dyner
from heauen was prepared,
and he the man of god dydde eate
among the hungry wyld beastes,
that hurte hym not.3. Reg. 17 So Helyas
in his flyght was fed, and in wildernes
by rauens and byrdes ministrynge
and bryngynge to hym
meate, he was norished in persecution.
O detestable crueltie of
mans malyce, the wylde beastes
forbeare to doo hurte, the byrdes
bryng fode to nourishe, men practise
wyles, and cruellye demeane
them selfes.
            ¶After all this we praye for our
synnes, sayeng: And forgyue vs our
trespaces, as we forgyue them that trespas
agaynst vs. After helpe of fode,
forgyuenesse of synne is desyred,

that he that is fedde of god, may
lyue in god, hauynge respecte not
only to this present and temporal,
but to the eternal lyfe, to the whiche
he may come, if his synnes be
forgyuen, whiche the lorde callith
dettes, lyke as in his gospelle he
sayth:Matth. 18 I haue forgyuen the all thy
dette, bycause thou praydest me.
But howe nedefully, howe prouidently,
and howe holsomly be we
admonyshed, that we be synners,
whiche be compelled to praye for
our synnes, that while forgiuenes
is craued of god, the mynde maye
remember his conscience. For to
the ende no man shulde stande in
his owne conceyte, as though he
were an innocent, and extollynge
hym selfe, shuld peryshe the more
he is instructed & taughte, that he
synneth dayely, sythen he is commaunded

dayely to praye for his
synnes. And thus fynallye Iohn̄
in his epistell admonyssheth vs,1. Iohan. 1
sayeng: If we saye that we haue
no synne, we deceyue our selues,
and the truth is not in vs. But if
we woll confesse oure synnes, the
lorde is faithfull and iuste, whiche
wol forgyue vs our sinnes. Both
these he hath comprised in his epistell:
that we oughte to praye for
our synnes, and that we shall opteyne
forgyuenes whan we praye.
And therfore he saith, god is faith
full to forgyue synnes, holdynge
the faith of his promise. For why
he that taught vs to praye for our
sinnes, hath ꝓmised, that fatherly
mercy and forgyuenes shulde folowe.
He hath ioyned and added
therto a lawe, constraynynge vs
with a certayn condition and promise,

that we shulde so desyre our
synnes to be forgiuen vs euen as
we forgiue theym that trespas ageynste
vs: Knowynge well, that
it canne nat be obteyned, that we
aske for our sinnes, rxcept we wol
doo the lyke to them that trespas
agaynste vs. And therfore in an
other place he saithe:Matth 7 With what
measure ye mette, with the same
shall it be mesured to you agayn.
And he the seruaunt, whiche after
his lord hadde forgyuen hym all
his duetie, wolde not forgyue his
felowe, was trowen into pryson.
Bicause he wold not gentilly forgiue
his felowe, he loke that that
his lord had courteisly giuen him.
Whiche thynges Chryste in his
preceptes more strongly, and with
more vigour of his sharpe iudgement,
fortolde vs:Matt. 11. And whan ye

stande to praye (sayth he) forgiue,
yf ye haue ought against any mā,
that your father also whiche is in
heuen, may forgiue you your trespasses:
but if you wol not forgiue,
no more woll your father that is
in heauen forgyue your offences.
There is no excuse for the, at the
day of iudgement, whanne thou
shalt be iudged after thyne owne
sentence: and that thou hast done,
that shalt thou suffre. For god cō
               mandeth,
that such as loue peace,
concorde, & to liue in vnitie, shuld
dwelle in his house: and suche as
he made vs in our seconde natiuitie,
suche he woll vs beinge borne
againe, to perseuer: that we whiche
haue begunne to be the childrē
of god, shuld remain in the peace
of god, and we that haue one spicitie,
shoulde be of one minde and

intent: for so god receyueth our
sacrifice. He commaundethe the
stryuer, retournyng from the altare,
fyst to reconcile hym to his
brother, that with prayers commynge
from an harte, that loueth
peace, god may be pacified. Our
peace and brotherly concorde, and
the people knytte togyther in the
vnitie of the father & of the sonne,
and of the holy goste, is a sacrifice
hyghly acceptable vnto god. For
god regarded not the gyftes and
offerynges that Abill and Cayne
the fyrst,Genes. 4. offred vp in sacrifice, but
he behelde theyr hartes, that he
shulde pleace hym with his gyfte,
that pleased hym in his hart. The
peasible and iust Abell innocently
offrynge vp his sacrifyce vnto
god, taught all other, whan they
offre theyr gyft at the altare, so to

come with the drede of god, with
a symple harte, with the lawe of
iustice, with the peace of concord.
He that was suche in the sacrifice
of god, was afterwarde worthily
made a sacrifyce to god: that he
fyrste shewyng a profe of martirdome,
with the glory of his bloud
tasted the lordes passion, the whiche
had in hym bothe iustyce and
peace. Suche the lorde crowneth,
such at the day of iudgement shal
with the lorde be reuenged. But
he that is at debate and strife, and
lyueth not in peace with his bretherne
(lyke as the blessed apostle
& holy scripure witnesse) though
he shuld be slayne for the name of
Chryst, yet coude he not escape the
cryme of dyssention. For as it is
written:1. Iohan. 3 who soo euer hateth his
brother, is a mankyller: & a man

sleer commeth not to the kyngedome
of heuen, that he may lyue
with god. For he can nat be with
Chryst, that had rather be the folower
of Iudas than of Chryste.
What maner synne is it, that can
nat with the baptisme of bloudde
be washed awaye? What faute or
offence is it, that can nat be purged
with martyrdome?
            ¶This also our lord necessarily
werneth vs, that in our prayer we
shulde saye: And let vs not be ledde
into temptation. In the whiche part
it is sheweth, that our aduersarye
can nothynge do ageynst vs, without
god before permytte hym: to
the ende that all our feare and deuotion,
and obseruation, shulde
be conuerted to God. For in oure
temptations the fende hathe noo
power, without it be gyuen hym

of god, as holy scripture proueth,
whiche sayth:4. Reg. 24. Nabuchodonosor,
the kynge of Babylon camme to
Hierusalem, and cōquerid it, and
god gaue it into his hande. Power
is gyuen to the dyuell ageinst
vs, after as our synnes be, as it
is wryttē:Esay. 42. Who gaue Iacob and
Israel to them to be trodē vnder
foote and spolyed? Dyd not god,
ageynst whome they synned, and
wolde nat walke in his ways, nor
here his lawes, therfore hathe he
brought on them the wrath of his
displeasure? And agayne, of Salomon
synnynge and leauyng the
commandementes and wayes of
the lorde, thus it is wrytten:3. Reg. 12. The
lorde raysed an aduersarye vnto
Salomon.
            ¶Power is gyuen agaynste vs
two maner of wayes: eyther for

our punishment, when we offend,
or elles for our glorie, when we be
proued: lyke as we see doone on
Iob,Iob. 1. god declarynge and saying,
Beholde, all thyuges, what so euer
he hath, I gyue into thy handes,
but beware thou touche hym
not. And Christ in the tyme of his
passion,Iohan. 19 saith in the gospel: Thou
shuldest haue no power on me, yf
it were not gyuen the from aboue
Whā we pray, that we fal not into
temptation, we be admonished
of our infirmitie and weakenes,
while we so pray, to thend no man
shuld extolle hym selfe, that noo
man shuld proudely & arrogantly
take any thing vpon him, that no
man shuld repute it his owne glorie,
eyther of confessyon, or of passion,
sithen our lord hym felf teachynge
humilitie,Marc. 14 sayth: Watche

and pray, that ye fal not into temptation,
The spirite is wyllynge,
but the flesh is weke: so that when
an humble and lowly confessyon
goth before, and al togither ascriued
vnto the lorde: what soo euer
in lowly wyse, with feare and honour
of god is asked, of his mercy
he woll graunt vs.
            ¶After all these thynges, in the
fynyshynge of our prayer cometh
this clause in a briefe collection,
concludyng all our petitions, and
prayers. For in the laste place we
saye: But delyuer us from euyll, comprehendynge
all aduersities, that
our ennemye endeuoureth to doo
agaynst vs in this worlde: frome
the whiche a trustye and sure defence
may be, yf god woll delyuer
vs, yf we humblye prayenge and
tenderly besechynge hym, he woll

vouchesafe to helpe vs. Whan
we say: Delyuer vs from euyll, there
remaynethe nothynge nowe that
ought to be farther asked, whan
we shall haue oones desyred the
Protection of god agaynst yuell:
whyche being opteyned agaynste
all thynges, that the dyuell and
the worlde worketh, we may stand
sure and safe. For wat dreede of
the worlde is to hym, to whom in
the worlde god is the defendour?
What meruail is it, dere brethern
if the prayer be suche, whiche god
taught, whiche as a maister most
worthye, hath abreuiate all oure
peace with his helthefull worde?
Nowe this thing was before told
by the prophete Esaye, whanne he
beinge replenyshed with the holy
gooste,Esaye. 10. spake of the maiestie and
pitie of god: A worde consumyng

(sayth he) and breuiatynge in iustyce:
for god shall make shorte
his worde in all the roundnesse
of the erthe. For whan the worde
of god, our lorde Iesus Christe,
came to all men, gatherynge togyther
bothe the lerned and vnlerned,
to euery kynde and aege,
he gaue preceptes of saluation:
he made a compendyous worke
of his preceptes, bycause the memorie
of the lerners shoulde not
be greued in the heuēly discipline
but shulde quickly lerne that that
shuld be necessary to the pure and
symple faith. So whan he taught
what euerlasting life is, in a great
and diuine briefenes, he comprehended
the mistery of lyfe,Iohan. 17 saying:
This is the lyfe euerlastyng, that
they know the, to be the only true
god, & whom thou hast sent. Iesu

Christ. Also when he gatherid out
of the law & prophetes, the fyrst &
chiefest preceptes:Deuter. 6 Harke (he said)
Israell, thy lorde god, is one lord
onely. And thou shalte loue thy
lorde god with all thy harte, with
all thy soule, & with all thy myght
and power. This is the fyrst, and
the seconde is lyke to this: Thou
shalt loue the neyghbour as thy
selfe. In these two commaundementes
hange al the lawe and the
prophetes. And agayne he sayth:
What so euer you wold that men
shulde do to you, euen so do ye to
them.Math. 7. This is the lawe and the
prophetes. And the lorde hath not
taught vs with onely wordes to
praye, but also with dedes: he him
selfe ofte prayenge, and with the
wyttenesse of his owne exaumple
shewynge vs, what we oughte to

do, lyke as it is wryten:Luc. 9. He was
goynge into wyldernes and prayinge.
And agayne:Mat. 14. He went into
a mountay ne to praye,Marc. 6. and was
all nyghte in his prayers. Nowe
if he prayed, that was withoute
synne, howe moche more oughte
synners to praye? And yf he watchynge
all the nyght longe prayed
continually, howe moche more
ought we to watche in the nyghte
and busily praye? The lorde praied
and made petition, not for hym
selfe: for what shuld an innocent
praye for hym selfe? but for our
offences, lyke as he hym selfe declareth,
where he saythe to Peter:
Beholde, Sathan hath desyred,Luc. 22.
that he myghte syfte you euen as
wheate: but I haue prayd for the,
that thy feyth fayle not. And afterwarde
he prayed the father for

all sayinge:Iohan. 17 I praye not for these
onely, but also for those, whiche
throughe theyr worde shall beleue
on me, that they all maye be one,
lyke as thou father art in me, and
I in the, that they also may be one
in vs. Great is the benignitie and
mercy of the lorde for our saluation,
that was not contented to redeme
vs with his bloud, but more
ouer wolde vouchesafe to pray for
vs. But se what he desyred in his
prayer, That lyke as the father
and the sonne be one, soo we also
shuld remayne in that Vnitie, wherby
we maye well perceyue, howe
gretly he offendeth, that breaketh
that vnitie and peace, seinge the
lorde prayed for it, wyllynge to
haue his people knytte to gether
in one: knowynge full well, that
Discorde cōmeth not to the kyngdome

of god. But whan we stand
to praye, dere bretherne we muste
watche, and with all the hole hart
applye our selfe to prayers. All
worldely and carnall care muste
be laid apparte, ne the mind shuld
runne on no other thing than that
that is prayed for. And therfore
the priest before he prayeth, with
a preface prepareth the mindes of
his bretherne, sayeng, Sursum corda,
vp the hartes: that whan the people
answereth. Habemus ad dominum,
we haue to the lorde: he is admonyshed,
that he shulde thynke on
none other thing than on the lord.
Let the breaste be shutte agaynste
the aduersary, & open to god onely:
ne he shulde not suffre the enemie
of god to approche nere hym
in the tyme of prayer: For often
tymes he cometh priuely, and entreth

in, and subtilly deceyuynge,
draweth our prayers frome god:
to thend we shuld haue one thing
in our hartes, and an other in our
wordes. whan the mynde & sense,
and not the sounde of the voyce,
must pray to the lorde with a syncere
intention. For what a sluggysshe
slouthfulnesse is it, to be
withdrawen and caught with pyuysshe
and prophane thoughtes,
whan thou shuldest praye to the
lorde, as thoughe there were any
other thynge, that thou shouldest
more thinke vpon, than that thou
speakest with god? Howe desyrest
thou to be herde of god, whanne
thou canst not here thy selfe? woldest
thou haue god myndefull of
the in thy prayer, whan thou remembrest
not thy selfe? that is,
not to be beware vtterly of thyne

ennemie, that is, whā thou prayst
the lorde, to offende the maiestie
of god with thy negligent praier:
that is, to watche with the eyes,
and flepe with the hart: where as
a chrysten man ought to watche
with the harte, whanne he slepeth
with the eyes. Lyke as it is written
in the name of the Churche
in the Canticles:Cant. 1. I slepe, and myn
harte waketh. Wherfore the apostel
carefully and warely warneth
vs sayenge:Coloss. 4. Continue in prayer,
watchynge in the same, teachyng
and shewyng vs, that they maye
optein that that they aske of god,
whome god seeth watchefulle in
prayer. But prayenge, we ought
not to comme vnto god with vnfruytefull
and naked prayers.
The petition is of none affecte,
whan bareyn prayer is offred vnto

god.Matth. 3. For sithen that euery tree,
that bryngeth forth no fruite, shal
be hewen downe, and cast into the
fyre, euen soo the prayer hauynge
no fruite, whiche is not fertile in
operation, canne not merite with
god. And therfore the diuine scripture
instructethe vs, sayinge:
Prayer is good with fastyng and
almes dede.
                  
                     •
                  obi. 12. For he that at the day
of Iudgement shall rewarde vs
for our workes and almes dedes,
wolle also dayely here that prayer
benygnely, whiche commeth to
hym with good warkes, So Cornelius
the Centurian, whan he
prayed, deserued to be herde: he
dyd greatte almes dedes amonge
the people, aud was alwayes in
prayer to god, before whom prayinge
about. ix. of the clocke, stode
an angell, yeldyng witnesse of his

worke, and sayinge:Actuū. 10. Cornelius,
thy prayers & almes dedes haue
ascended vp to the remembraūce
before god. The prayers do soone
ascende vp to god, whiche the merites
of our worke do bryng vnto
god. So the aungelle Raphaell
was alway to Tobie praying and
workynge a continuall wytnesse,
sayenge: To reuele and aknowlege
the warkes of god is moche
honourable. For whan thou and
Sara prayedst, I offered vp the
memorie of your prayer before the
syght of the clerenes of god. And
whan thou symplye buriedst the
deade, and bycause thou taryedst
nat to rise, and to leaue thy dynar
and wentest & buriedst the deade,
and I was sent to tempte the, and
agayne god sent me, to heale the,
and Sara thy daughter in lawe.

For I am Raphael one of the. vii
ryghtous aungels, whiche stande
and ar conuersant before the clerenes
of god.Esay. 58. Also the lord, by Esai
admonysheth and teacheth lyke
thynges, sayenge: Unknyt euery
knotte of vnryghtuousnes: vnlose
the stranglynges of wycked
bargaynes: Let the oppressed go
free, and disparple al vnrightous
thoughte. Deale thy bredde to
the hungrye, and bryng the poore
fatherles home into thy house. If
thou see oone naked, clothe hym
and despise not the household seruauntes
of thy sede. Than shall
thy lyght breake forthe in tyme,
and thy garmentes shall soone aryse,
and ryghtousnes shall goo
before the, and the clerenes of god
shall compasse the aboute. Than
thou shalte crye out, and god shal

here the, whyle thou art speakyng
he shall saye: Lo, I am here. He
promyseth to be present, and to
here, and to defende those, whiche
vnknytte the knottes of vnright
tousnes of the hart, and do almes
dedes amonge the housholde seruauntes
of god, accordyng to his
p̄ceptes, whyle they here that god
cōmaundeth to be done, they also
meryte to be harde of god. The
blessed apostle Paul,Phil. 4. being holpe
of the bretherne in the nede of tribulation,
calleth the workes that
were done to him, the sacrifices of
god: I was (saith he) euen fylled,
receiuyng of Epaphroditus those
thynges, whiche were sent frome
you, an odour of swetenes, a sacrifice
acceptable and pleasant to
god. For whan a mā taketh pitie
on the poore, he playeth the vserer

with god: and he that gyueth to
the pore and nedy, gyueth to god,
spiritually he doth sacrifice to god
an odour of swetenesse. In celebratynge
prayers we fynde, that
the thre chyldern with Daniel, being
stronge in feith, and victours
in captiuitie, obseruyd the thyrde,
the syxte, and nynthe howre, as a
sacramente of the Trinite, whyche
shoulde be opened in the laste
dayes. For the fyrste houre commynge
into the thyrde, shewethe
the perfecte nūber of the Trinite.
Also from the fourthe, procedyng
to the syxte houre, declareth an other
Trinite. And whan from the
vii. the. ix. houre is accomplished,
by thyrde houres the perfecte tryuitie
is numbred: whiche spacys
of houres, the true worshyppers
of god, dyd lōge sence spiritually

determine, that they seruid to praier
at certayne lauful and appointed
tymes, and afterwarde, the
thynge was manyfest, to be some
tyme a sacrament, that iuste men
afore dyd so praye. For the thyrde
houre, the holy ghost came downe
vpon the disciples, whiche fulfyllid
the grace of the lordis promise.
Also Peter, at the. vi. houre ascendynge
vp into the howse aboue,
was instructed bothe with sygne
and voyce of God, monysshynge
hym, that he shulde admyt al men
to the grace of saluation, when he
before doubted, whether he shuld
admyt and clense the gentyles or
no. And the lorde being crucified
at the howre of. vi. at. ix. of the
clocke, with his bloud dyd washe
away our synnes: and to thende
he myght redeme and reuyue vs,

he than with his passyon accomplysshed
his vyctorie. But to vs,
dere bretherne, besyde the howres
of praying, of olde time obserued,
bothe the tymes and sacramentes
haue increasid. For now we must
praye in the mornynge, that the
lordes resurrection maye be celebrate
with the mornynge prayer:
whiche thynge the holy goost dyd
notifie longe ago in the psalmes,
saying:Psalm. 5. My kynge and my god,
yarly in the mornynge to the lord
woll I pray, and thou shalte here
my voyce, Betime in the morning
I woll gette me to the, and wolle
intentiuely beholde the. And ageyne
by the Prophete, the lorde
saythe: Yarly before the sonne risyng,
they shall watche to me, sayenge:
Lette vs go and returne to
the lorde our god.
            
               ¶Also whanne the sonne gothe
downe, and the daye fayleth, it is
necessarye that we praye ageyne.
For, bycause Christe is the verye
sonne and the very day, the sonne
and the day of this worlde departynge,
whan we pray and desyre,
that lyght maye come ouer vs ageyne,
we craue the commyng ageyne
of Christe, the grace of eternal
light, to be giuen vs. That
Christe is called the day, the holy
ghooste declareth in the psalmes,
sayenge:Psal. 117. The same stone, whiche
the buylders refused, is made the
hed stone of the corner: this is the
lordis doinge, and it is meruaylous
in our eies. This is the day,
whiche the lorde hath made, lette
vs walke, and be ioyfull in it.
            Also that he is callid the Sonne,
the prophet Malachie doth wytnesse,

sayeng:Malach. 3. But vnto you, that
feare the Lordes name, shall the
sonne of rightousnes arise, and in
his wynges is healthe. Howe yf
Christ in holy scripture be the very
sonne and the very daye, there
is no houre exceptid to christē mē,
but that god ought to be ofte and
alwaye adored: that we, whyche
be in Christe, that is, in the verye
sonne, and in the very day, shuld
styl pray, and bryng the day to an
ende with prayers: and whan the
day is gone, and the nyght by alteration
and course is come, it is
noo dammage to them, that woll
praye in the darke season of the
nyghte. For with the chyldern of
lyghte, the daye is in the nyghte.
For whan is he without lyght, in
whose harte is lyghte? Or howe
dothe the sonne and the day fayle

hym, with whome the sonne and
the day Christe, is? We that be alway
in Christ, that is, in the light,
shulde not in the night cesse from
prayer. Soo Anna the wydowe,
without intermission praying alwaye
and watchynge, perseuered
in meritynge with god, lyke as it
is written in the gospell:Luc. 2. She departed
not (sayth he) frō the temple,
nyght and day seruynge god
in fastynge and prayeng. Let the
gentiles, yt are not yet illumined:
or the Iewes, which leauyng the
light, haue remained in darknes,
Ioke vp and se. We dere brethern,
which be alway in the light of the
lorde, whyche remember and vnderstand,
what we haue begun to
be sens we receyued grace, shulde
recken the nyght for daye. Let vs
beleue, to walke alway in ye light,

we can not be hyndered with the
darknes, which we haue escaped:
let no houre scape vs from prayer
in the nyght, let no prayer be lost,
through slouth and sluggyshnes.
We, that by the mercy and goodnes
of god, are spiritually newe
made and borne ageyne, shoulde
folowe that that we shall haue in
the kyngdome of heauen, oonely
day without any night. So in the
night as in the light, let vs alway
watche and pray, and gyue thankes
to god. Also lette vs not here
ceasse to pray and thanke hym.
