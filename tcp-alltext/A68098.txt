            To my Reuerent Fathers and Brethren in Chriſt, Maſter Couerdale, Mai. Turner, M. Whittingham, M. Sampſon, M. Doctor Humphrey, M. Leauer, M. Crowley, and others that labour to roote out the weedes of Poperie: Grace and Peace.
            
            
               BEcauſe wee are created for Gods glorie, and the edification one of another in Chriſte, and are all bounde to ſerue therevnto by wealth or woe, life or death: & chieflie they, to whom God hath giuen the greater giftes, & whom he hath called to greater roomes, are moſt boūden to be zealous for gods glorie, with godly ielouſie to preſent the church & ſpouſe of Chriſt vnder their charge, a pure Virgin to Chriſt hir huſband: and that by no ſubtiltie, as the Apoſtle warneth, they ſhould bee corrupted from the ſimplicitie in Chriſt. Therefore I nothing doubting of your zeale and diligence, my reuerende Fathers & deare Brethrē, who being in authoritie, are firſt called to the battell to ſtriue for Gods glorie, and the edification of his people, againſt the Romiſhe reliques and ragges of Antichriſt, but that yee will couragiouſly and conſtantly in Chriſt throwe out theſe ragges of Gods enemies. And I do further require you in the name of God (ſo farre as my ſimplicitie may be bolde to require your wiſedomes) that ye will by this occaſion, laye open other as great enormities, that we all knowe, and labour to race out all the dregges and remnauntes of tranſformed

Poperie, that are crept into Englande, by the too much lenitie of them that wilbe accounted the Lordes of the Cleargie. And for my part, by the grace and power of my God, though I ſinfull wretch haue no ſuch giftes nor authoritie, as can much further the cauſe or comfort you in your godlie trauailes: yet ſhall I and many more with me, A good deſire. pray for you, and with our ſimple giftes will deſire you, that we may ioyne together with you, to ſuffer togither in ſo good a cauſe, that is ſo much for gods glorie and the edificatiō of his Church, in the pure ſimplicitie of Chriſtes worde and Sacramentes, wherein our enemies and perſecutours are ſtraūgly bewitched, I wote not by what diueliſhe cuppe, that they do make ſuch a diuerſitie betwixt Chriſts wordes and his Sacramentes, that they can not thinke the worde of God to be ſafely inough preached, & honorably inough handled without cappe, Cope, or ſurpleſſe: but that the Sacramentes, the Marrying, the Burying, the Churching of women, and other church ſeruice, as they call it, muſte needes be declared with Croſſing, with Coping, with Surpleſſing, with kneeling, with prety wafer kakes, & other knackes of Poperie. O Paule that thou wert aliue, thou durſt tell theſe politicke gentlemen, that there hath bin to much labour beſtowed vpon them in vayne. Thou durſt ſay vnto them as thou diddeſt to the Corinthes, That they éate not the Lordes ſupper, but playe a pageaunt of their owne, to blinde the people, and keepe them ſtill in ſuperſtition, farre from the ſimplicitie of Chriſtes ſupper: to make the ſelie ſoules beleeue, that they haue an Engliſhe Maſſe: and ſo put no Too true. difference betwixt trueth and falſhoode, betwixt Chriſt & Antichriſt, betwixt God and the Deuill. They are ſtraungly bewitched, I ſaye, that will binde their Engliſhe prieſthoode and ſacramentes

to garments: but much more enchaunted, that can finde no garments to pleaſe them, but ſuch as haue bin openly poluted with Poperie, ſuperſtition and Idolatrie. But moſt of all in this poynt ſhall their madnes appeare to al poſteritie, becauſe they make theſe Antichriſtes ragges Cauſa ſine qua non, in Chriſtes holy Miniſterie: ſo that theſe ſhall make an Engliſh Prieſt, be he neuer ſuch a dolt or villaine: as we haue very many, and without theſe Romiſhe reliques not Paule him ſelfe (as one of them did blaſpheme) and the reſte in effect do plainly affirme. Well, by Gods power wee haue fought with the wolues, for theſe and ſuch like Popiſhe chaffe, and God hath giuen the victorie: wee haue nowe to do with the Foxes, let vs not feare. There is no crafte, cunning, or pollicie againſt the Lorde. Our B. are Foxes. We haue Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and al the Prophetes euer ſtryuing againſt the hypocrites of their tyme, on our ſide. A ſtrawe for Popiſhe policie. We haue the worde of God to warrant vs to roote out all monumentes of ſuperſtition and Idolatrie: and are charged to abhorre them, to count them accurſed, and to defye them and deteſte them, as a menſtruous cloathe. They haue not the worde of God. And what wiſedome is in them ſayeth God by his Prophete Ieremie? They talke of obedience and concord, but there is no obedience againſt the Lord, nor any concorde to be deſired, but where Gods glorie and veritie is preferred. Elſe better to haue all the worlde to runne in hurlie burlie, and heauen and earth to ſhake, then one iote of Gods glorie ſhould decay, ſo farre as in vs lyeth. Wee haue their owne lawes and proclamations to roote out all monumentes of ſuperſtition and Idolatrie, and their owne wordes are contrarie to theſe their owne doings. They repent the reformatiō proclaimed, as did the Iſraelites. They buylde agayne

that which they once deſtroyed. And this do they openly, that all the worlde may wonder at their follie. But what they do ſecretly, God will one day haue declared openly: yea they make the name of God, and his doctrine that we profeſſe, to be euill ſpoken of already by many of their doinges. Their iudgement haſteth, that for ſuch cauſes perſecute Gods true Preachers. Wherfore let vs not feare their threateninges. There can none perſecute vs for this traſhe, but ſuch as are neyther whot nor colde; and then they ſhalbe vomited out, vnleſſe their zeale increaſe, or they that are Atheiſtes, ſuch as haue no god before their eies, but their god is their belly. And thoſe are worldpleaſers, or open Papiſtes, whom God hath giuen vp to a reprobate ſenſe. Wherefore we muſt thus take it, that they are gods roddes for our ſinnes, becauſe wee haue bin no more zealous in Gods cauſe, nor carefull to ſeeke his glorie. That wolfe wincheſter, & his butcher Boner fought once againſt vs. for the groundes of this geare: but loe, howe the Lorde, within two or three yeeres ouerthrew them all to giue vs courage to goe forwarde. We are to ſlacke and negligent: That monſter remayneth & is fedde, as the Papiſtes ſaye, for their ſakes. And we graunt that his paūche is fedde for ſome ſecrete purpoſe. We do crye, kill this traytour, enemie to the Crowne, to the Realme, to god & man, whiche burned Gods holy Teſtament, and murthered his Saintes and ſeruauntes. We haue the lawe of god and man for vs. We are anſwered. Nay your ſelues ſhalbe compelled to turne your cloathe, your coates and cappes, and to get you into his liuerie, and to be like him in his garmentes. O Elias that thou haddeſt liued, or that thy ſpirit were amongſt vs. The Papiſtes which are in the countreys glorie in theyr aſſemblies, that the whotte goſpellers,

ſhall now be dryuen to weare their attyres. Let vs neuer giue them any cauſe of ioye, though we ſhuld dye for it. Moyſes will not yeelde a hoofe of a beaſt in Gods buſines. He will not leaue a loupe of a Curtayne vnmade, nor make a buttō or a claſpe more or leſſe. Eleazar would not diſſemble by eating of vnlawfull meates. The faithful Iſraelites would not receyue ſo much, as an Iuey buſhe. Cō
               trariewiſe, Origen carrying a braunche, and profeſſing that he bare it for Chriſte at the firſte, was compelled afterwards to open Idolatrie: So curſed a thing it is to giue any place to the wicked. All the Papiſtes that ſay, they worſhip Chriſte in the croſſe and God in the Sacrament, doo ſtill vnder theſe wordes continewe in Idolatrie. Beware of deceytfull wordes that couer wicked purpoſes to drawe vs from Chriſtian ſimplicitie. And let vs ſtande conſtantly agaynſt all abuſes: repent for our former coldnes in Religion and other ſinnes, and call for helpe from aboue. For the arme of our Lorde is not ſhortned. Wee are aſſured that wee ſeeke Gods glory, and our aduerſaries may ſee if they can ſee any thing, that this thing whiche they ſeeke is not for Gods glory: ſeeing the Papiſtes the enemies of God, do ſo deſire it, and glory in it, that we, whom they moſt hate, can not be ſafe, but vnder their garmentes. We are aſſured that wee ſeeke Gods glory, when wee followe Chriſte, his Apoſtles and Prophetes, who euer diſpiſed theſe Phariſaicall outward faces and viſardes. Chriſte Mat. 15. findeth faulte with the garments of the Phariſees. Paul counteth all his Phariſaicall ſhewe to bee dounge. Zacharie ſayeth, that the falſe Prophete Phil. 3. ſhalbe aſhamed of his prophecy, and forſake his garmentes, wherein he deceyued. And ſhall the Zacha. 13. true Prophets be faine to creepe into their cowles? For by the ſame authoritie that the Queene commaundeth

one, ſhe may commaunde any peece of Popery, ſo that ſhe name it policie. But Ezechias and Ioſias knewe no ſuch authoritie. They ſaye, that it is for pollicie, and I do eaſely beleue it, that they do care, leſſe for Chriſtes Religion, than for pollicie. But let them beware that they follow not Ieroboam, that made ſuch like Prieſtes for policie, as would do as he commaunded them. Achaz of pollicie brought ſuch an Aultar into Ieruſalem 1. Reg. 12. as he did ſee at Damaſcus, where he had ouercome the Idolaters and their Idolles. But curſed was 2. Reg 16. his pollicie, and ſo are they all, that will retayne any thing of their old Idolatrie. Nabuchodonozors Idoll was ſet vp for vnitie & pollicie: But without Daniel. 3. the warraunt of Gods holy word, there is neither good vnitie nor pollicie. That godly Father Bucer calleth the Tenthes and firſt Fruites, ſacriledge and robberie, though they bee kept ſtill for pollicie. The Croſſe and Candleſtickes vpon the Queenes altar, are ſuperſtitious, though they bee kept there I wott not for what pollicie. The adoration of the Sacrament, in the Countreys where they knocke and kneele to a wafer, is a Popiſhe pollicie. That VVomen baptize, that pluralities, tot quots, impropriations, non reſidences, diſpenſations, ſuſpenſions, excommunications, and abſolutions for money are graunted, it is euill, like as are many other enormities borowed from Rome, which remayne in the name of pollicie. All theſe thinges were abhorred as Popiſhe, ſuperſtious, and Idolatrie among our Engliſhe Goſpellers, both Biſhoppes and others, when they were vnder Goos rodde in pouertie. But they haue nowe learned Courtly Diuinitie, to grounde all vppon pollicie. Humble them agayne (O Lorde) that they do not forget thee nor thi poore people: whom thou haſt ſo dearely bought, whiche by theſe their

policies are blinded, and careth for no more, but that they may haue this ſuperſtitious ſhew, which is ſtill ſo maynteyned. Let him mumble as he liſt, if he be thus apparelled, all his ſeruice is good ynough, otherwiſe it is nothing worth. Thus cauſe you them to periſhe, by your pollicies, for whome Chriſt hath dyed. Furthermore, if Popery be ſuperſtitious and Idolatrous, euill and wicked, as yet there was neuer a worſe thing in the worlde, then are we commaunded to abſteyne from all participation thereof, and from all the ſhewe thereof: Ab omni ſpecie mall, that is, from all ſhewe of wickednes. Theſe garmentes were the ſhewe of their blaſphemous prieſthood: herein they dyd ſing and ſaye their ſuperſtitious Idolatrous ſeruice: they dyd ſence theyr Idolles and helpe forwarde their Idolatrous Maſſes. What pollicie can it bee then to weare this geare, but a ſuperſtitious, wicked & Popiſh pollicie? They do it for policie, they ſay, that theyr Prieſts may be knowen and magnified of men Did not the Phariſees vſe the ſame pollicie, to do all theyr workes and make all their garmentes, both Philacteris vpon theyr heads, and theyr wyde and ſyde Robes and borders, that they might be more aſpectable and notorious to the people? but theyr woo is threatened aboue all other ſinners. To ſuch hypocrites, as beyng voyde of all true holyneſſe, delite in all outwarde ſhewes: theyr curſe is moſt inculcate. Their pollicie is, that the Prieſtes ſhall weare white in the Churches, to ſignifie theyr vertue, their purenes, & holyneſſe: and when they go forth of the Church, they muſte weare blacke gownes and blacke hornes, for contrary pollicies, and for diuers ſignifications. Our Maiſter Chriſtes pollicie was expreſſed in one worde, Feede, Feede, Feede: and the Prophetes before, and the Apoſtles afterwarde. If Chriſt be

the wiſedome of the Father, the true Miniſters ſhalbe well ynough knowen, by that one marke which he giueth: And if he haue not that marke, better vnknowen then knowen, both for him ſelfe & others: therefore lett them not ſaye for ſhame, that they ſeeke gods glorie, Chriſtes will, or the edification of his Church, by their pollicie. Whyles they threaten and ſtoppe the ſpreading of Gods worde and feeding of Chriſtes flocke, commaunded by writing to excommunicate the moſt faythful labourers in the planting of the goſpell, becauſe they will not weare the ragges of Poperie, to expulſe the moſt valiaunt Souldiours agaynſt the Romiſhe Antichriſt: the moſt earneſt ouerthrowers of the kingdome of Satan, which ſtandeth in ſinne and blindnes. O beware you that wilbe Lordes ouer the flockes, that you be not ſore puniſhed for your pryde towardes your brethren, and your cowardlineſſe in gods cauſe: that for Princes pleaſures & pompoſe liuings, do turne Poperie into pollicie, and to become our perſecutours vnder the cloake of pollicie: It were better to looſe your liuings, then to diſpleaſe god in perſecuting of your brethren, and hinder the courſe of the worde. But as our duetie is, we will praye for you, and for all our Brethren in the Miniſterie, that God of his grace woulde graunt vs more zeale for his glorie, than any of vs hath had heretofore: more deſire to edifie Chriſtes people in pure ſimplicitie, to preſent them a chaſte Virgin vnto Chriſt, then hitherto hath appeared, that when the head ſhephearde ſhal cal to account, wee bee not aſhamed: but being founde perfecte in all good workes, may receyue the Crowne prepared. As for you deare brethren, whome God hath called into the brunte of the battell, the Lord keepe ye conſtant, that ye yeelde neyther to tolleration, neyther to any other ſubtill perſwaſions of diſpenſations,

or licenſes whiche were to fortifie theyr Romiſhe practiſes: but as you fight the Lordes fight, be valiaunt. God will not leaue you, neyther forſake you, as you ſeeke gods glorie: god wil glorifie you: and as by you Chriſtes Church is edified, comforted and confirmed in Chriſtian ſimplicitie, ſo ſhal you receyue comfort by Chriſt your head Captayne, when you ſhalbe called to giue accomptes of your ſtewardſhippes, and to be rewarded for your fidelitie. The matter is not ſo ſmall as the worlde doth take it: It will appeare before all be ended, what an harde thing it is, to cut of the ragges of the Hiora of Rome. It is beautiful, but poyſonfull: there is no dallying with ſuch a mounſter, beware of looking backe to Sodome, or delight any whit in ther garments of Babilone: neither once touche the poyſoned Cuppe, though it be of golde or glittering. Let vs repent of our former ſinnes vnfaynedly, and then ſhall we abhorre and ſtampe vnder our feete theſe ragges that were appoynted to ſuperſtition and Idolatrie. Let vs hate the blaſphemous Prieſthood, ſo iniurious to Chriſtes prieſthoode, that euery patche and token of it, be in execration, deteſtation, and accurſed: and take no parte of it vpon our heades nor backes, leaſt we be accurſed as it is. Let vs not make the heritage of god as a byrde of many colours, holding of diuers religions. Let vs not mixe the Iewes with the Gentiles. Let vs not in no wiſe mixe this our Religion with any thing of Antichriſt: Let vs not confirme the blinde in their blindneſſe, neyther the weake in their ſuperſtition. But rather let vs take awaye, if we can, the names, memories, and al monuments of Poperie, and that Antichriſtes prieſthoode. Let vs open our windowes with Daniel, and profeſſe what we are: their crueltie ſhalbe our glorie. Let vs followe Paul, that knewe that the

true goſpell could not be retayned, if any Iewiſhe cerimonies were maintayned. Let vs rather neuer weare any garment, then we ſhould weare thoſe, whereby our brethren ſhould be weakened, offended, or boldened to take parte with the Idolaters, and ſo through our hautines in knoweledge, our weake brethren periſhe, for whom Chriſte dyed. Beholde and marke well, howe they fall backewarde that yeelde in any iote, and ſee howe they are edified, and increaſe in godlines, which holde that right way that you go, in the which the Lorde increaſe you, and vs all, and ſtrengthen vs with his holy Spirite, that we may continewe to our lyues end, always both by our thoughts, wordes, and works, to aduaunce his glorie and honour, dayly more and more, nowe and for euer, Amen.

            ¶ Miles Monopodios the Souldiour, to his Capitayne Cornelius Theophilus.
            
            THERE be great controuerſies here abroade (God turne them to good) about the displacing of godly Preachers. Vpon the which occaſion, I (falling in talke with Bernarde myne olde fellowe ſouldiour, who is nowe a Lordes Chaplaine) thought it at the firste lawfull, as Horace teacheth: Ridentem dicere verum: with myrth to haue paſſed ouer this lamentable matter, and ſo to haue made, but a light skirmiſhe. But when I was once entred, our communication waxed more earnest, and there followed ſome bitter wordes. Afterwarde we had ſuch argumentes, that Sir Bernarde was almoſt readie to forſake his benefice, as a great ſorte of that order would doo, if they knewe where to finde ſo eaſie liuinges: they are ſo despiſed of all the worlde, and ſome of them ſo troubled in conſcience. I ſende you the whole diſcourſe, ſomething (I graunt) enlarged: publiſhe it, if you pleaſe. For whoſoeuer other men thincke lightlie of it, this displacing of Chriſtes true Ministers, for Popiſhe traſhe, doeth ſo grieue me at the harte, that I can not but ſpeak againſt it. And ſo would I haue all men to doo,

that are touched with anie godly zeale: ſo ſhal we not be guiltie of other mens faultes, thorow our ſilence.
            So long as the Parliament indured, wee all had hope of amendement, and kept ſilence: but nowe that it is ended, and all hope of man is past, we must turne to God by prayer, and that which we can do by wordes and by writing, let vs do it. Let vs not ceaſſe to fight against the remmanauntes of the Romane Antichrist, and to labour to breake downe and aboliſhe (if it be poſſible) all his enſignes. For it is of neceſſitie, that his lawes ſhould ceaſe, ſeeing his blasphemous priesthoode is renounced. Let vs do our diligence in driuing away all Popiſhe traſhe, and leaue the ſucceſſe vnto God. Our fathers haue fought the bloodie battle, and ſome of our owne brethren do fight againſt vs. Howebeit, we are yet but in a light combate: more is to be feared, Let vs reſiſte the beginnings.
            In this Dialogue that I ſende vnto you, if I do ſeeme ſometimes pleaſaunt, knowe that it is not, without ſome bitternes of minde, as had the Prophetes, when they had to do with halters & neutrals: whoſe fooliſhnes being counted great wiſedome in the worlde, they did thus deride. If I ſeeme to angrie, and to whote and earneſt, conſider that it is not in myne owne cauſe or

quarell, but in Gods cauſe, in the cauſe of his ſeruauntes, in the common cauſe of this whole Church of Englande: For which, howe can we be to much carefull, earneſt, and zealous? And I do thinke aſſuredlie, that God doth call vs all by this controuerſie, to a reckoning, for our cold and careleſſe trifling in Religion: by the which Atheiſme, Papiſme, and Lutheraniſme, ſtriue against vs fainte ſouldiours, hoping for the victorie. Therefore whom the Lorde findeth, neither colde nor whote, he will ſurelie vomit out. He that is not with me, is againſt me, doeth he ſay. But happie ſhall he be, that fighteth manfully vnder his Captaine Chriſt, againſt the patched Antichriſt: whoſe dregges who ſoeuer drincketh, he is incountinently druncken therewith, be it little, be it much that he taſteth: as we may ſee, by the Lordlie Biſhoppes, who nowe for the dregges and patches of Poperie, despiſe their fellow ministers: and perſecute thoſe ſame perſons, whom of late they loued as brethren, and bare Chriſtes croſſe with them, in the late perſecutions.
            But if this Poperie continewe, they wilbe younge Popes doubtleſſe, and poperie it ſelf will growe vp againe: The wounde of the firſt beaſt wilbe healed in that, that the ſeconde ſhall doo the ſame things, which the firſte hath done.

Therefore, let all good men labour all that they can, to plucke vp theſe wicked weedes of Poperie, the remmenauntes of ſuperſtition and Idolatrie. For Chriſtes garden can neuer bee purged cleane inough from ſuch poyſon. For if anie little twiſte, of Antichriſtes inuentions bee lefte, the bodie will growe afterwarde. It did ſo creepe vp at the beginning, like a little Iuie ſtalke, eating out the hartes of the great Oakes, Kings and Emperours, and deſtroyed the Chriſtian congregations.
            We Chriſtians are commaunded to abſteyne from al ſhewe of euil: and we are ſtraitlie charged, to haue no parte with the whore of Babylon: neither to haue anie fellowſhippe with the fruitleſſe workes of darkneſſe, but to reprooue them. And if they will not do ſo, which will be counted the Paſtours, the Doctours, and leaders of the flocke, God can and will rayſe vp others, to pitie his cauſe, and to purge his Temple: as he hath done many times heretofore. For in the cleare light of the Gospell, God will haue Biſhoppes or Miniſters, that ſhalbe diſcerned from the people, by doctrine and conuerſation, and not by garmentes of ſtraunge faſhion. The people are nowe to be inſtructed, and no longer with ragges to be mocked. Neither muſt a Prieſt of clowtes any longer be ſet before their eyes: but

the meſſengers of God muſt be ſought, to powre Gods worde into their harts: the courſe wherof, whoſoeuer ſtoppeth or hindereth, hee ſhall beare his iudgement what ſoeuer he be. Playe you therefore the parte of Cornelius, as you haue done heretofore. Call your ſeruauntes and ſouldiours to the knowledge of Christes Gospel. Cheariſhe the true Preachers, of whome this worlde is vnworthie: and though they ſhould be murdered, as they are nowe robbed and impriſoned, yet let vs with honor burie their bodies, as Ioſeph did their Maiſters.

            A pleaſaunt Dialogue conteining a large diſcourſe betweene a Souldier of Barwick, and an Engliſh Chaplain, who of a late ſouldier, was made a Parſon, and had gotten a pluralitie of Benefices, and yet had but one eye, and no learning: but he was prieſtly apparailed in al points, and ſtoutely maintained his popiſh attire, by the authoritie of a booke, lately written againſt London Miniſters.
            
               This Dialogue was written almoſt ſeuen yeares ago, but becauſe there was hope of reformation ſoone after, therefore was it of charitie by the writer ſuppreſſed. But now that no hope remayneth, it is thought good that the follie of the perſecutors bee made knowne vnto all, that will ſee it, or read it.

                  Sir Bernarde Blynkarde, a formall Prieſt, and a Lords Chaplaine.
               
            
            
               
               
                  Miles.
                  
                     WHat Bernard mine olde companion? Well met. I ſkarce knew thee, thou art ſo diſguiſed and chaunged. Thou didſt iette vp and downe ſo ſolemnely in the Churche, and ſo like an olde popiſhe Prelate, that a great while I doubted of thee: what man? art thou ſo ſtrange? haſt thou forgotten me? Thou haſte a good marke whereby I muſt needes know thee: and if I had not bin, thou ſhouldeſt haue had none eye this daye to ſee withall.
               
               
                  Bern.
                  Yes Miles I knewe thee, and remember that thou waſt euer an honeſt fellow towardes me, and thou ſauedſt my life then, I confeſſe.
               
               
                  Mil.
                  But Bernarde, I pray thee tell mee of thine honeſtie, what was the cauſe that thou haſte bin in ſo many chaunges of Apparell this forenoone, nowe blacke, nowe white, now in ſilke and golde, and nowe at the length in this ſwouping blacke gowne, and this ſarcenet flaunting tippet, wearing moe hornes alſo vpon thy heade, than euer did thy father, vnleſſe he were a man of the ſame order? I pray thee, of good fellowſhip tell me how thou art come to this chaunge, ſince thou lefteſt our companie? for ſurelie

I haue gotten nothing by my long ſeruice but ſtripes and woundes, and nowe I muſt needes leaue of this trade, becauſe I want my legges, and aſhamed I am to begge. I would therefore verie fayne, enter into this thy glorious trade, wherein thou art ſo well trimmed and apparailed, if I might doe it ſafelie. Belike thou wanteſt none other thing, for one quarter of thy gowne woulde make me a coate, and a ſleeue of thy ſurples would make me a ſhirt. There muſt needes be plentie, where there is ſo great ſuperfluitie. And I that haue liued in ſcarſitie, in perill and labour all my life long, would nowe in my old age, finde ſome eaſe and ſafetie: as for our learninges, they are both like, thou knoweſt, vnleſſe of late thou haſt bin at ſome Vniuerſitie.

But I muſt admoniſh thee of two thinges, the one touching me, the other thee: in thy talke thou muſt vſe me more reuerently, and tye a Sir by your girdle whē you ſpeake to me.

There was but one after the order of Melchizedeck, and the other ceaſed at Chriſt his comming: ſo that it were a deniall of Chriſt to renew that order.

Nay my Lorde my M. will none of that. As for my Lorde, I hearde him ſay, that he could neuer go, to any of theſe Geneuians Sermons, that hée

came quiet home, but that there was euer ſomewhat, that pricked his conſcience, hee thought alway, that they made their whole Sermon againſt him. But in the hearing of Mattins, euenſong & prickſong at Paules, or in my reading of my ſeruice in his chappell, he ſayth, he feeleth no ſuch thing, for he is neuer touched, but goeth merilie to his dinner.

                  Thus ſayd wicked Ahab, by the good Prophet Michaiah, but as for mee, I vſe to ſay nothing, but that I haue hearde good Preachers teache openly in the Pulpet, that all popiſh Prieſtes apparell are ſuperſticious: and ſuch church ware as they did weare is iufected with idolatrie. Wherfore as the idolles themſelues were deteſtable, and the Pope to all chriſtian men, and to all true Engliſh hartes execrable: So al the monumentes of idolatrie, and all the vſuall liueries and garmentes of the idolatrous Prieſtes, and Popes Chaplaines, ought to be reiected of the Seruauntes of Chriſt, as abhominable. And al that you ſay agaynſt the Geneuians, might be broughte againſt Chriſt and his diſciples in the ſame wordes and ſentences.

                  I know that you haue learned this

leſſon of the London Miniſters. But I haue read a Booke of late, written by a Proctor for our engliſh Prieſthoode, which calleth them ſtarke fooles, and aunſwereth them (I warrant you) in all pointes: I warrant you Miles he is a man of great authoritie, that dare ſo boldly reuile them, and handle them like abiectes, and my Lordes the Biſhops doe take our partes, againſt thoſe buſie fellowes, and keepe ſome of them in priſon, and put other from their liuinges. And I may tell thee in ſecrete, if we had not found ſuch a maiſter to maintain our ceremonies, and alſo vnleſſe the Biſhops had playde the Lordes in deede, theſe prating Preachers would haue made ſome of vs, to haue turned our tippets, and for very ſhame to haue forſaken our Benifices, yea, if they had had libertie, but a little longer, they woulde haue diſgraced my Lordes Grace, the Archebiſhop of Caunturburie, and haue made all England to beleeue, that our gracious Metropolitane (whoſe glorious Grace, long might it laſt, for we poore ignoraunt prieſts ſhall neuer faile, vnleſſe he fall) had bin but an idoll ſheaphearde, and an Engliſh Pope: and (which greeued the other Biſhops at ye harts) thei began ſhrewdly to ſhake ye lordly

ſtate of all the Cleargie. They woulde not haue a Biſhop nor a Miniſter knowne by his apparaile, but by his preaching. A ſhamefull hereſie. They crie, Paſce, Paſce, 
                     A perilous hereſie. 
                     Paſce, I cannot tel what they meane. They would haue men ſuch fooles, to turne to that poore beggerly eſtate that was amongſt the Apoſtles, and alwayes toyle and trauayle with the people, and braule and chide when any thing is amiſſe. But I tell thee playne, they had then loſt the greateſt part of their number, a iolie ſort of gentlemen ſwouping in their ſarcenets, and many other good fellowes too. Therefore I doe accounte (with maiſter Examinator) all theſe poore beggerly London Miniſters, ſtarke doltes, and chriſe fooles, for their preachinges, their writings, and their beggerly liuing in their offices. I tell thee, my Lordes the Biſhops that were their fellowes beyonde the Seas in Queene Maries daies, are now aſhamed of them, and care not for their companies, they are ſo beggerlie, ſo buſie bodies, and will allow nothing but Gods worde in the churches.

                  As for the Biſhops, they are not all ſo farre gon, I truſt in God, but I pray thee ſir Bernards, in what part of his Booke,

doth your M. Examinator cal them fooles?

                  Is this M. Doctors eloquence▪ hee had neede to haue great corners in his cappe to hide his aſſes eares. Let him not begin his Oration thus among ſouldiors. But what is the cauſe I pray you, that you, and your mayſter of Ceremonies, dare ſo proudly (at the firſt choppe) call Gods Miniſters & faythful teachers of his holy word in London, fooles? Let me talke with you a little for olde fellowſhips ſake. Is it becauſe they haue laboured ſo faithfully, to feede the flock of Chriſt (which you mock with Paſce, Paſce) that few can be named comparable to them, in paines, in trauailes, in perils and diligence? M. Examinator (whoſoeuer hee was) ſhould not thus againſt reaſon, haue railed on ſuch, whome their very enemies the papiſtes doe reuerence for their payns, their care and diligence. Aſke at the Churches of Antline, Peter, Bartholmewe, and at other Churches alſo, what painefull trauailes from time to time, they haue ſuſtayned: what perils▪ in the plague they aduentured. Haue not the poore ſick perſons and

priſoners by them bin comforted, and the people moſt diligently inſtructed? If this be true (as it is moſt true) for the reuerence of him, whoſe ſeruants they are, they ſhould haue bin more gently handled, and more brotherly aunſwered, then thus to haue bin called fooles, at ye firſt word, though in ſome pointes they had fayled as men, and not ſatiſfied the great wiſedome of M. Examinator. Nether doth the Rhethoricall Arte of your M. teache him thus rudely to begin, with them whome he ſhoulde perſwade: neither Chriſtian charitie (if either of you were euer entred into that Schoole) doeth permitte you to call your Brother Foole, as you may reade in our Sauiour Chriſt his firſte Sermon, Math. 5. which hee beginneth with bleſſing and not with brauling.

                  Maiſter Examinator is a wyſe Gentleman, and he ſawe ſome cauſe, why he called them fooles, I warraunt you.

                  I graunt that it is counted a faulte amongeſt the wiſe of the worlde, to bee ſo earneſtlie and diligentlie occupied in preaching. And for this cauſe the wiſe kinſmen of Chriſt, called him madde, & would needs binde him: and therfore your high Prieſts,

who are the accuſers, Iaylors, and Iudges to theſe perſecuted perſons, preache ſo ſeldome. But the Spirite of God giueth an other commaūdement, ſaying: I charge thee 
                     2. Tim. 4
                           •
                        . 2. 
                     therefore before God, and his ſonne Ieſus Chriſt, which ſhall iudge the quicke & the dead at his appearing, and in his kingdome: Preache the worde, bee inſtant in ſeaſon, and out of ſeaſon: improue, rebuke, exhorte with all long ſuffering and doctrine. This, and ſuch like commaundements of God, hath cauſed theſe good men, and many others of their ſorte, to take theyr liues in their hands, as Iob ſpeaketh: ſome to loſe their liues, and all to yeoparde theyr liues in that late plague of London, when you (Foure horned Gentlemen) fled from your cures, and hyred Iornemen in your places. At what time theſe men ſhewed thē ſelues the good ſheepheardes, ieopardinge their liues for the ſheepe, and you were foūd hyreliuges, taking ſtil the gayne, but flying from the perilles.
                  Is this ſay you the cauſe? Or is it rather for that they rebuked Poperie, Idolatrie, & all kinde of ſinne ſo ſharpely, & were ſo feruent and zealous? With the which earneſtnes againſt ſinne, ſuperſtition and hypocriſie,

the halting goſpellers, and luke warme worldlinges muſt needes be offended, and count them fooles and mad men, as Feſtus did Paule, and the olde worlde the Prophetes. For the wiſedome of God in his ſeruaunts, hath euer in this poynte, by ye world bin counted follie. And alwayes the politike wiſe gentlemen, count it their ſafetie, to be like in religion, with the multitude. And therefore are bolde to mixe together many religions of Chriſt and Antichriſt, of God and the Deuill: yea and ſome of them dare ſaye, that both were good, and both in their tymes to bee obeyed. O miſerable blindnes, that nowe, when light is come into the worlde, men will not caſte awaye the workes and fruites of darkneſſe and repent of them.
                  Either is this the cauſe, that (when the people haue bin taught theſe thirtie yeares in Englande, that the Pope is the Romane Antichriſt, whoſe name ought not to remain in our bookes, nor to bee ſpoken with our mouthes, vnleſſe it were in deteſtation: now after ſo long trauaile againſt this enemie of Chriſte, by their fathers, their Brethren, and themſelues, they ſeeing few or none going forwarde, to roote out the remnaunts of

Antichriſt, but many ſtande at a ſtay, many caſting away their weapons, ſo that the Enemie gathereth courage, many ſouldiors to ſhrinke backe▪ not onely wearing Antichriſtes liueries, but following that Romiſh A lamentable defectiō. Balaams couetouſneſſe, and that old popiſh pompe, with other his curſed conditions) theſe faithfull Miniſters will not be partakers of their ſinnes, leaſt they receaue part of their plagues. Loe this is the crime, this is the fault: lo this is the fooliſhneſſe, wherwith your wiſe and prudent Examinator is able to charge theſe true and faithfull Miniſters of God.
                  If I knew what your proctor were, whether he be a prieſt of ye popiſh order, or of the Engliſh order, or a man of the lay and lewd ſort, as the papiſts are wont to tearm them, I could ſhew in him greater lewdneſſe, and more follie, than you or he can proue in thē. But becauſe I doe not know his perſon, I will anſwere the cauſe of Chriſts ſeruants, and let him and you alone to your Lord and Maiſter: giuing you both warning, that you ſhall giue an anſwere before ye great Iudge, for that which you doe or ſay, agaynſte theſe his little ones, whome you call fooles. But to the matter, aunſwere me playn. Is it not

meete that they, which ſhould bring others to the obedience of Chriſt, ſhould firſte practiſe in themſelues the ſame obedience? and that they ſhoulde doe nothing without the warrant and commaundement of Chriſt? that ſo not only by doctrin, but alſo by their example of obedience, they may teach their auditors only to depend vpon Chriſt.

                  This is the ſumme of the requeſt and ſupplication of the Godly Miniſters of London (as farre as I can heare) that after ſo long preaching of Chriſt in London (almoſt theſe thirtie yeares) they may put in The requeſt of the godly miniſters. practiſe, the doctrine of Chriſt, and miniſter his holy ſacraments in that ſimplicitie, that Chriſt and his Apoſtles hath left thē, without the ceremonies and garmentes abuſed by the papiſtes (the enemies of Chriſts his Goſpell) which cannot in any wiſe, make for edification in Chriſt: & that ſeeing their Fathers and Brethren, and they with their own mouthes, haue ſo long cried out againſt all popiſh Ceremonies: as kneeling before the ſacrament, whereby much idolatrie hath bin and is committed: as the miniſtration in the wafer cake, whereby the people hath

bin brought into vayne imaginations, and haue not felt the comforte, that our Sauiour Chriſt would haue ſenſibly to be preſented in the vſual bread of many graines, and many crummes, making one body, and being the vſuall foode: as alſo againſt other monumentes of ſuperſtition and idolatrie, as the garments of the popiſh prieſthoode, and of the popiſh Maſſe. Nowe (I ſay) at the length, after ſo many yeares teaching, and ſo much blood of Gods Saintes ſheade for the aboliſhing of Antichriſt, they themſelues ſhould not be compelled, to giue any ſignification in their owne perſons and bodies, that they haue any concorde or agreement with that Romane Antichriſt, but that they go before their flocke, to practiſe in worke ye thing, which they haue taught in wordes, for the baniſhing from their owne bodies at the leaſt, ſuch thinges as they knowe not grounded on Gods worde, but mans meere inuentions, ſuperſtitions, idolatrical, papiſticall, and therefore very hurtful to Chriſts flocke, committed to their charge, becauſe that ſuch traditions are only cloakes to the tranſgreſſion of Gods commaundementes.
                  Now muſt we the ſeruauntes of Chriſt, reaſon with you, the proctors of Antichriſts

inuentions, what fooliſhneſſe you can finde, in this their requeſt. And that wee may agree, what is Wiſedome, and what is Follie, and ſo iudge who is the Foole, and who is Wiſe: let vs firſt conſider your own texts of fooliſhneſſe, that your Proctor beginneth his preface withall. Aunſwere not a foole according to his fooliſhneſſe, leaſt thou alſo be like him: which may be vnderſtand that thou mayſt not be like the foole neither in worde nor deede. Nowe if I can prooue the Papiſtes in their religion and their apiſh apparaile to be fooles, then I truſt alſo, I ſhall obtayne, that I maye neither defende their cauſe by word nor deede, and he that doth defende them, aunſwereth to their fooliſhneſſe, and is partaker of their follies. If the texte be vnderſtande, that we may not raile againſt the raging Foole (as alſo the ſcripture giueth) by this texte, then may we learne to giue place to thoſe, that raile againſt Chriſts miniſters, and not to handle them as their follie deſerueth, but yet to warne them of their perill, and to deſire them to beware that they bee not wiſe in their owne conceites, for then is there more hope of a Foole then of ſuch Wiſardes.

                  Oh, olde Bernarde, thou ſpeakeſt groſely, according to thy capacitie. But by the ſame chapter of Salomon, we that fight againſt Antichriſt, may exhort you, that you be not like dogges, turning to your vomite of beggerly traditions, and popiſh traſh, for ſo vſe the fooles to returne to their fooliſhneſſe, ſayth Salomon. And we counſell you eftſoone, to learne of the word of God, what is the true wiſedome, and to imbrace this wiſedome once known, & to ſtriue for it vnto the death: as the ſcripture exhorteth in an other place, for hath not God made the wiſedome of this world fooliſhneſſe? Doth he not ſay, that hee will caſt away the wiſedome 
                     1 Cor. 1. 19. 25. 26. 27. 
                     of the wiſe, and deſtroy it? and that he will take the wiſe in their owne wilines? and that the fooliſhneſſe of God, is wiſer than men? and God hath not called many wiſe after the fleſhe, but hath choſen the fooliſh thinges of the world, to confound the wiſe, and the weake to confounde the ſtrong, and vile thinges in the worlde and deſpiſed, that no fleſhe ſhoulde reioyce?
                     
Wherefore we muſt ſeeke firſt of al the true wiſedome, which reſteth not in mans brain, but in Gods breſt, whiche hee hath by his worde vttered vnto man, and is otherwiſe altogether hid from him, as the Lorde ſpeaketh by his Prophet Iſaiah, ſaying: My 
                     Eſa. 55. 8. 9. 
                     thoughts are not your thoughtes, neither my wayes your wayes, ſayth the Lorde, for as the heauens, are higher then the earth: ſo are my waies higher thē your waies, and my thoughts aboue your thoughts. Then muſt we runne to the word of God onely, to know which is the Wiſedome that God alloweth, that is, to hearken vnto the lawes and ordinaunces that God doth teache, and to put nothing to his worde, nor take any thing therefrom. Therefore crieth this wiſdome of God by Salomon: O yee fooliſhe, 
                     Pro. 1. 22. 
                     how long will ye loue fooliſhneſſe, and the skornefull take pleaſure in skorning? &c. Becauſe they hated knowledge, and did 
                     Pro. 1 29. 30. 31. 
                     not chuſe the feare of the Lord, they wold none of my counſell, but deſpiſed all my correction: therefore ſhall they eat of the fruite of their owne wayes, and bee filled with their owne deuiſes. Beholde, it is the worde of God, and therefore the true wiſedome, that the London Miniſters do follow.

But you and the Papiſtes following your owne deuiſes, are filled therewith, and content your ſelues, and ſo are yee giuen vp to maintaine ſuperſtitious vanities, but ſuche God hateth. And for theſe London Miniſters, may I ſay as Paule ſayde to the Corinthians: You ſuffer fooles gladly, becauſe that you are wiſe. &c. You are the Miniſters of Chriſt, (I ſpeake it as a foole) they

                  Of your ſtate, and ſuch as you bee, (which can onely be known by cloutes and garmentes, and neither can teache nor will learn) we wil ſpeake anon. But marke thou this matter that we haue in hande. This is the true wiſedome allowed before God and all good men, to ſeeke counſell at Gods worde, and to ſuſpect our wittes of fooliſhneſſe, according to the ſaying of Salomon:

                     That the wiſe man heareth coūſel, though the foole ſeeke no further, but thinke his owne way right. Agayne ſayeth he: Heare counſell and receiue inſtruction, that thou maiſt be wiſe in the latter ende. For many deuiſes are in mans harte, but the counſell 
                     Pſal. 19. 7. 
                     of the Lord ſhall ſtande. It is the counſell of the Lord & his word, that bringeth wiſedome to the ſimple, ſaith Dauid. This counſell of the Lord teacheth the yong man to direct his wayes, and maketh the childe wiſer than his teacher, that knoweth not Pſal. 119 9. the will of the Lorde. For as this is the only ground of true wiſedome, to knowe gods will, and therein to reſte: So is it the cauſe of all follie, to ſwarue from the ſame. And this is the cauſe, that the foole maketh a mocke of ſinne, & that he walketh in darkneſſe. And the foole thus walking by ye way, thinketh al other to be fooles, ſayth Salomō
                      afterwarde. Euen ſo do you fooliſhe prieſts, and fooliſh maintainers of ſuperſtitious vanities, becauſe you haue none other ground, but your owne brayne, your owne will, and your owne good intentes. You thinke that the Lōdon Miniſters, & we that take their parts, are ſo fooliſh as your ſelues are, ye we ſhould only ſtay vpō our owne wits & wills.

Nay we ſettle our conſciences herein, vpon the expreſſe commaundement of God, and the examples of the moſt godly in all ages, and eſpecially vppon our Mayſter Chriſte and his Apoſtles. And as poore and vnlearned a ſouldier as I am, yet ſhalt thou know, that I haue ynough to ſay againſte them. And as the chriſtian ſouldiers, vnder Iulian that wicked Emperor, would not yeelde to any ſhew of ſuperſtition, not ſo muche as in the taking of their wages, to burne a little incenſe, nor to weare a garlande vpon their heads, becauſe the chriſtian ſouldier is commanded, to abſtayne from all ſhew of euill, and to ſight and ſtriue agaynſt the workes Fevv ſuch Souldiers. of darkeneſſe, and to reprooue them, and ſo ſtriuing as hee oughte to doe, waite for the Garlande: So rather would I ſterue vnder Barwick Walles, than doe as thou doeſt, and haſte counſelled me to doe, either in taking of a Benefice by ſuch vnlawful means, or to enter into the popes liuerie, my ſworn enemie, becauſe I am an Engliſh man, and to mee moſt deteſtable of all other earthly creatures, becauſe I am a chriſtian man, for I know, & am fully perſwaded by the worde Marke this, O ye Conformatiſtes. of God, that the Pope is ye very Antichriſt, the ſonne of perdition: againſt whom, with

hart and hand I doe thinke my ſelfe moſte bounde to fight. Therefore my harte ariſeth in my body, when I ſee thee and thy fellows cloathed like his Chaplaines, that burned the bleſſed Bible, and our faythfull fathers, and deare Brethren in our eyes.
                  You ſay that it is great wiſdome for you, to weare this Popiſhe geare, and call other men fooles that will not doe it. Then was there greater wiſdome (ſay I) in the Pope and his Prieſtes, that haue taught you thus to doe. So may men ſay of a hundred points Marke this. of poperie, that you maintaine, buying and ſelling licences, diſpenſations, pluralities, abſolutions, and other marchandiſe of that Romane Antichriſt. And I doe aſke you all, as you will aunſwere before God, what doe you by theſe your deedes, but approoue that Romiſh beaſt, and labour to heale his deadly wounde, and ſo to make a mocke of a reformation of religion: But God wil not be mocked. There was neuer yet any reformation begunne, and after repented, but it was terribly puniſhed. It is better not to haue known the way of truth (ſaith Peter) 2. Pet. 2. 
                     than after they haue knowne it, to turne from the holy commaundement. You began to runne well (ſayth Paule) what carnall

imaginations haue hindered your courſe? Seeing we haue begunne the true Religiō, by caſting away mans traditions, worſhipping God in ſpirit, as our Sauiour Chriſt hath taught vs, he will not be content that you maynteyne, theſe carnall, beggerlie, Antichriſtian pompes, rites, lawes, garmentes and traditions. Therefore like as Paule crieth out, againſt the Galathians, and calleth them fooles, and counteth them bewitched, for turning backe, but to Iewiſhe ceremonies: So might I call thee a fooliſhe Papiſte, bewitched by Antichriſt, that thus rayleſt againſt the Miniſters of Chriſte, for the maintenaunce of thy fooles bables, borowed of the Papiſtes.

                  I do cal them none otherwiſe than all the world calleth them. And thou ſhouldeſt do me great iniurie, if thou didſt ſo call me, neither would I beare it at thy handes: for it might put me in hazard of my liuing, if I ſhould yeeld to be a papiſt: neither doth the garment make a man otherwiſe then he is, as is the olde prouerbe.

                  No, but the Garmente giueth men great occaſion to geſſe what hee is, or howe he woulde bee counted, a Courtier or a Carter, a Collier or a Souldier, as thou and I

were wonte to weare Skarfes, Harquibuſhes, or Halbertes to ſignifie what we were, and thou knoweſt that if we ſee a man in a Friers garment, or a Fooles coate, eyther we ſay he is ſo, or elſe he woulde be ſo counted. If he weare a Hares ſkutte, or a horne, we cal him a Hunter. If he weare the weede of a regular, we cal him by his order, Mōke Frier, or Hermite. If he weare this ſecular Weede, men haue hitherto counted him a ſecular prieſt, for this was the playne difference amongſt thē, that their ſecular prieſts forth of the Churche, ſhoulde weare this apparaile that you doe: and in the Churche, at the leaſt, they ſhoulde weare a ſurples alſo, as you doe. The other Sectes had likewiſe their Sutes: ſome Cattes tayles, ſome graye Amices, ſome Lambeſkinnes, ſome white Miniuere, ſome blacke, ſome blew, ſome chaungeable Sarcenet, as you haue yet in your Monaſteries, and Cathedrall Churches. The which Fooles hoodes are but a vayne phariſaicall pompe: then vttering pride, when they ſhoulde be moſt farre from pride, when they appeare before God in prayers.
                  And therefore all theſe popiſhe fooleries ſhould be baniſhed from Chriſts church, for

Chriſt our Sauiour (if he had thought them decent for his religion) woulde haue commaunded them, but hee forbiddeth vs ſuche Phariſaicall ſhewes, and his father will not now be worſhipped as the Iewes did then, or as the Idolaters haue done at any time. And Peter and Paule with all the other Apoſtles, and faithful Miniſters of Chriſt, as they were otherwaies known, then by garments: ſo needed they no commaundement for garmentes: neither gaue they any commaundement for their ſucceſſors, but onely to be known by the careful feeding of Chriſt his flocke, and ſuch other markes as Paule nameth in the ſixt chapter of the ſeconde Epiſtle to the Corinthians. But that proud Pope (who is that curſed idoll ſheapheard) that he might be contrarie to Chriſt and his in all thinges, and that he might haue ſure Note this, ye Magiſtrates. marks, and euident knowledge of his trayterous broode in al countreies, cauſed al his ſects and ſworn ſouldiers, men and women, to chaunge their liueries, from the Kinges liege people whereſoeuer they dwelt. So that no King nor Emperor had any authoritie ouer them, in any that tooke this Popiſh attire vppon their backes: they had ſo many priuiledges and immunities. Wherfore

if Princes will ſuffer ſtill, thoſe that ſhould be their ſubiectes to weare ſuch Popiſh weedes, they ſhall not want Popiſhe practiſes, of ſuch as delite in their olde Fathers liueries, by whome they had ſo many commodities.

                  If Maiſter Examinator ſay true, theſe miniſters are worſe then the Papiſts, for he calleth them Shrinkers, Schiſmatikes, Bellygods, Deceauers, Flatterers, haſtening to the ſecte of Anabaptiſtes and Libertines, little differing from Donatiſtes, Diſturbers, Factions, Scoffers, Biters, Snappers at Superiours like Pelagians, like Andians, Rogatians and Circumcellians, and ſmell of the Papiſtes.

                  What? Of the Papiſtes? All is like true. Would to God none of your ſide did more ſmell of Papiſtrie, nor of the other vices. Are they Shrinkers, that willingly giue their bodies to the priſon, rather then they will departe from the ſimplicitie of Chriſt his goſpel? was Paule a Shrinker, that would not circumciſe Titus for ye falſe brethren? Nay they are Shrinkers, that turne back, as your men haue done. Eleazar was no ſhrinker, that would not eat ſwines fleſh: neither the Mother nor the ſeuen Brethren,

nor yet Daniell, nor yet Moſes, that would yeeld nothing for commaundement. As for Schyſmatikes they cannot bee, that cleaue ſo faſt to Chriſte, that they will ſuffer nothing of Antichriſte to come vppon their backes: and they holde onely of their heade Chriſte. Howe farre they are from Belly gods, all that knowe them can witneſſe, and their deedes do teſtifie. And if you would put of thoſe poiſoned popiſh weedes, we would aſke none other witneſſe but your owne ſelues: who when you went apparailed as they doe, thought them as honeſt and godly as any of you were.
                  Caſt off therefore this bloudie Beaſtes geare, yt maketh you ſo cruell againſt your Brethren, and call them no more, by the odious names of thoſe monſtrous Heretikes, Donatiſtes, Andians, Rogatians, and Circumcellians, whoſe Hereſies your own conſciences muſt needs confeſſe, that theſe true Preachers of Chriſte doe hate: but conſider deepely in your hartes, and know aſſuredly that there is one Lord and Iudge of you and them: before whome this matter muſt once be tried, and all men that knowe them, and haue heard their doctrine, ſhalbe compelled to cleare them before this heauenly Iudge,

of all theſe vile ſlaunders. Who hath ſpoken or written more plainely, againſte the Anabaptiſtes, the Libertines, and other fonde ſectes, than they haue done? who hath more euidently taught, and oftener called vppon the true obedience to their ſuperiors? Doe they require any thing but onely the ſame, that Bucer, Martyr, Alaſco, Caluin, Bullinger, Beza, Viret, Gualter, Muſculus, and all the reformed Churches doe practiſe? How can they then be called Anabaptiſtes?
               
               
                  Bern.
                  They call the London Miniſters, eyther Anabaptiſtes or Iohnabaptiſtes. It is the one I am ſure, I cannot tel what they meane.
               
               
                  Mil.
                  They cannot be without great malice called Anabaptiſtes, who haue written and preached ſo plainly and purely againſt that perilous ſect, againſt the Rebaptizing of children, againſt ye Iuſtificatiō of works, againſte their fonde Communitie, agaynſt their lawleſſe life, that they call Spirituall, agaynſte their deniall of Chriſtian men to beare rule: for theſe are the cheefe of their opinyons, agaynſte the whiche, theſe godly men haue cōtinuallie preached, and theſe errors will nowe ſpreade doubtleſſe, ſeeing that ſo many good Preachers

are put to ſilence. Howe be it in very deede, there is ſome cauſe, why they may bee likened to Iohn Baptiſt, for he, though he were of the Prieſtes linage, yet did hee renounce all their glorious garmentes, to begin our Chriſtian Religion, in all pouertie and ſimplicitie, and herein our men followe his example euidently.
               
               
                  Bern.
                  But they ſay, that your men denie to obeye Magiſtrates, as doe the Anabaptiſtes.
               
               
                  Mil.
                  Nay there is great difference. The Anabaptiſtes denie all power and gouernement of ciuile Magiſtrates, as a thing vnlawfull. Our Miniſters ſay that this power and gouernment, is an Ordinaunce of God moſt neceſſarie, and moſt lawfull▪ therefore they quietly ſuffer all euill at the handes of the Magiſtrates, onely refuſing to doe euill at their commaundement. Thus did Iohn Baptiſt, thus did Peter, and Iohn the Euangeliſt, profeſſing that they muſt obeye God, rather then man. Now God commandeth that we ſhall not do like the Idolaters: (which cauſed Eliah and all the good Fathers to haue their ſacrifices and Ceremonies apart) but to cauſe them to turne to vs, and not we to turne to them, to abſtain from

all ſhew of euill, which cauſed Daniell to open his windowes, and Eleazar to forbeare the eating of lawfull fleſhe. Yea God commaundeth to roote out the monumentes of ſuperſtition and idolatrie, and not to ſpare the Idolaters thēſelues. This cauſed Iehoiada the Prieſt, to do that which he did. God will haue the idolatrous Prieſtes and their names to be aboliſhed. God will haue the falſe Prophets aſhamed of their garments, wherein they haue deceiued. Now though ſome Biſhops, or ſome ciuile power will cō
                     maunde theſe Miniſters to doe the contrarie, they doe not reſiſt the powers, but only aunſwere with the Apoſtles: whether it be right in the ſight of God, to obey you, rather then God, iudge ye.
                  Howbeit, this is the olde crafte of ſatan, to charge Gods ſeruauntes, as factious and ſeditious. Elijah, & Eliſha, Michaiah, Iſaiah, and Ieremiah, and all the true Prophets haue thus bin charged, & when the prieſtes could not cauſe the Princes to impriſon thē, or to ſlay them, yet would they charge them as Amaziah did Amos, and Caunturburie of late did Leauer, yt they ſhould not preache neare the court, and the great Citie, where the Prince was. Yea Chriſt and his Apoſtles,

who preached moſt perfecte obedience Looke to this, O yee Magiſtrates in time. to God and to Gouernoures, were counted blaſphemers of God, and deſpiſers of ſuperiours, Samaritanes and workers with Diuels. Therefore they muſt be content to be rayled vpon, and reuiled in this worlde, by phariſaical hypocrites, as their Maiſter was before them, and all his faithfull ſeruauntes. As for them they follow their M. Chriſt & his Apoſtles, in all ſimplicitie and puritie of life and doctrin, praying for their enemies, and ſtill going forwarde in the Lordes buſineſſe, whereas you followe the Phariſeies and Papiſtes, counterfeite hypocriſie and crueltie againſte Chriſtes ſeruauntes. They crie, Come out from that Romiſh Babilon: looke not back to that 
                     2. Cor. 6. 17. Eſa. 52. 11. 
                     ſpirituall Sodome, flee from thence, touche none of that polluted ware. The Pope is Antichriſt, and all that popiſh traſh is poyſon. Antichriſt and Chriſte can haue no agreement, neither can their ſeruaunts haue any concorde.
                  Your men ſoberly ſay, that the Biſhop of Rome may not be opēly profeſſed nor prayed agaynſte, and therefore you haue put out of your Letanie the prayer againſte the Biſhop of Rome, and his deteſtable enormities:

but yet his liueries may be worne, and many of his lawes and traditions muſt needes be reteyned. Chriſtes miniſters doe crie with their Maiſter Chriſt, Paſce, Paſce, Paſce, which you graunte Sir Bernard, that you vnderſtand not. But your Archeprelate of Caunturburie (as all England ſuppoſeth by his doinges) iudgeth this precept plaine follie. They crie with the Apoſtle Peter, to all paſtors & Curates, Paſcite, Paſcite, feede 
                     1. Pet. 5. 2. 
                     as much as lieth in you the flock of Chriſt: Your ſide ſay, Reade by thy ſelfe, or by thy Good ſtuffe for the Popes church. Iorneyman, or thy hireling that may ſerue two or three pariſhes, ſinge in a Surpleſſe, ring two or three peales at the Burialles, play vppon the Organes, chaunte in the Quire. &c. This geare is eaſily done, and pleaſeth well the multitude. The Apoſtle Paule ſayeth of himſelfe, in the reſpecte of all Chriſt his true Miniſters, that he hath a Stewardſhip committed vnto him, and therefore crieth: Woe vnto mee, If I doe not preache the Goſpell. As for you and your ſide, you thinke this is a very ſmall matter, and ſuppoſe that this maye bee done, Per ſe, vel per alium: though GOD ſayeth playnelie, Thou thy ſelfe ſhalte tell them of their ſynnes, or elſe will I

require the blood of them that periſhe, at thy handes.
                  
                  Agayne Paule ſayth: preache tempeſtiue, intempeſtiue, in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon. You ſay foure times in a yeare will ſerue to hire a preacher, or at the leaſt to reade Homilies. And where God by Malachie commaundeth, that the lips of the Prieſt ſhould keepe knowledge, and that the people ſhal require the law at his mouth: You require little or nothing of your Engliſh Prieſtes, but to ſaye the Catechiſme, and to weare a Cappe, Coape, and Tippet. God ſayth by Salomon: Where there is no Prophecie, the people periſh: But you ſay, many of vs cannot prophecie, nor inſtructe the people: nay many will not take muche paines that way, and ſome dare ſtop the mouthes of the true Prophets and Preachers, becauſe they labour to roote forth the remnaunts and reliques of the falſe prophets. Peter crieth to his fellow Elders, to be examples of the 
                     1. Pet. 5. 2. 3. 
                     flock, not following filthie lucre, nor ſhewing themſelues as Lordes ouer Gods heritage. What filthie gaine ſeeke you, and how many wayes? How are you Lords in names, in commaundementes, in ſpoyling and robbing true preachers, and caſting of

them into priſon. Our Maiſter Chriſt ſaith, you ſhall not be ſuch. Runne not headlong Luk. 22. 26. with the popiſhe Prelates and ſworne enemies, from Chriſt and your Brethren. Are thoſe papiſticall Garmentes ſo poiſonfull, that of perſecuted Paules, they can make perſecuting Saules, if they be once caſt ouer your ſhoulders? Abhorre ſuch poyſon all you that be of God.
                  Diuers of the Biſhops that now bee, did once loue and cheriſh their Brethren, and bare the croſſe of Chriſt with them, whome now they moleſt & perſecute, ioyning hands with the wicked worldlinges. What is the cauſe of this chaunge? In whome is this mutabilitie? The one ſorte remaineth the ſame men, in Apparaile not altered, nor in harts chaunged, but in worde and deede, as they are wont to doe, deteſting ſinne and wickedneſſe, preaching the Goſpell, with al faythfull diligence. Let them take heede, which forſake the fellowſhip of ſuch, to ioyn themſelues with the contemners of the goſpell, the fornicators and the couetous, with Papiſtes, or with others, that walke not with ſtraight ſteppes, but by their halting are turned out of the way, and whiche ſhewing themſelues neither hote nor colde muſt

be vomited out.
                  Theſe Godly Miniſters call vppon the Marke this good Reader, & praye for the ſame vvith vs. high Prelates for eccleaſiſtical Diſcipline, and to haue the Churche reformed, as our Maiſter Chriſt appoynteth. Your proctors and maintainers, will haue none other Diſcipline than the Pope had, which was gainfull to the purſe, and ſo groweth the corruption of maners worſe and worſe. Theſe crie for the election of Miniſters by their learning and maners, according to Pauls rule: and that the drunkards, and filthy couetous, the periured, the blaſphemers, and ſuch like be not ſuffred in the Miniſterie: your ſide will not be ſo rigorous, for then they coulde not haue ſuch chopping Chapleins, neither As Dios, & Grauet, and ſuch like. could they themſelues keepe in their hands ſo many Benefices.
                  To make an ende of a matter that is infinite and endleſſe, theſe Miniſters of Chriſt, as they themſelues are faythfull Laborers: ſo teache they that hee that laboureth not, ſhould not eate of the fatte of the flock: your proctors approue and maintain you that be loiterers, to deuoure the churche goods, the ſweat of poore mens labors, and doe allowe proprietaries & improprietaries, drones to ſucke the Hony combe, yea they maynteyne

hogs, dogs, Wolues, Foxes, Symoniaks, Such as Parſon Taylor, Parſon. Buffin, & ſuche like. Vſurers, men, women & boyes, to ſpoile the poore lambes of Chriſt of al foode, both ſpirituall and corporal, and vnder the cloake of a few popiſh ceremonies, they couer all carnall filthines, as though god could or would be ſatiſfied with ceremonies & trifles. This is the wiſedome wherein your ſide, agaynſt Chriſtes Miniſters haue to glorie, and if this be wiſedome that you follow, than are the other in greate follie. But I doe feare that M. Examinator & his ſide, muſt heare: Apage Satan, ea quae ſunt hominū nō Dei ſapit. Your humane wiſedome that you boaſte of, is not of god, & therefore it is diueliſh.

And I tell thee that though the Papiſts were Theeues, and Robbers, and Sodomites, and ſoule quellers, and what thou wilt, yet are we none ſuch, for we do all for policie.

                  Nay all your doinges are not policie. Haue you no religion? your church ſeruice is not policie, and in the Archebiſhops aduertiſements, you haue lawes temporal, meere eccleſiaſticall: your faſting dayes are not mere policie, for your Archbiſhop graū

counted policie) there bee many thinges in your reformation, that will be founde fonde policie: for what is this, that both the phiſition of body and ſoule muſt bee conſulted Marke this prety ſtuffe. withall, before you may eate fleſh? was not this once playne poperie? And what is the common babling of the Prieſtes, that cannot read to edification, and therefore make all the Engliſh ſeruice, like the old Mattins and Maſſe? Is it not that whiche Eſaiah ſpeaketh? Becauſe this people come neare me with their mouthes, and honour mee with their lips, but haue remooued their hartes from me, and their feare towardes me was taught, by the preceptes of men: therefore will I worke a wonder amongſt this people, for the wiſedome of their wiſe men ſhall periſh, and the vnderſtanding of their prudent ſhalbe hid.
                  
                  And let vs conſider to whome God ſpeaketh, by his Prophe ttheſe wordes. Is it not to a people that had no open Idolatrie at that preſent? neither yet mumbled their prayers in a tongue not vnderſtoode, as did the papiſtes? But to ye Iewes that read & ſong the pſalmes & ſcriptures in their own Marke well. mother tongue, howbeit they babled onely with the tongue like hypocrits, & the words

were, as it were, of a booke faſt ſealed. Such trifling is nowe amongeſt you Engliſhe Chaplains. For when you haue reade ouer one place of the Scripture fortie times, yet you and your hearers are neuer the wiſer. You ſay you haue done your ſeruice, as ſayd the papiſtes. Now (if you keepe this hypocriticall ſhew, onely for policie, and make it to ſerue you politikely to win your liuings, or for to keepe the people in ſome feare, as Machiuel that Italian dogge doth teache) you may perceaue by this Texte of Iſaiah, that Gods wrath will be the reward of your policie. Likewiſe you keepe Bona eccleſiae by policie, and do no part of your dutie. Is not this theft & robberie? Doth not Chriſt call them al Theeues, that enter not in by him, but for their own gain to rob and to ſteale? And will not they, and all men count him as a theefe (good Bernarde) that taketh great wages of a towneſhip to keepe their Kyne, their Swine, or their Sheepe, and ſuffreth their cattle to ſticke in the myre, to periſh in the ditches, their ſheepe to rot and to run aſtray, where they liſt, and pulleth their fleeſes of from their backes, and ſpendeth all that he can ſcrape from the flock, vppon his owne bellie?

                  O Bernard, Bernard, this ſpiritual Spirituall theeues, the vvorſte theeues. theefe is worſe by farre, who robbeth ſoules and bodies, and by his euil example maketh the poore ſheepe to think, that there is none other world, no God to puniſh, and therfore as he robbeth from them, ſo they may without peril rob frō him & al others. That filthy Rome is called the ſpiritual Sodom, Egipt, and Babilō, whom we ſhould abhor, & from whom we muſt flie, ſo that we may touch no vnclean thing that cōmeth from thence. But what are all your policies in Religion, but patches plucked foorth of that Puddle? Your Lordely Biſhops in names, in manners, in attires, and all their offices, fetche all their pompe from thence. Your Deanes, Archdeacons, Subdeacons, Chauncelors, Officials, & your Curats, & al their deckings and doings, & all your courts & conſiſtories depend of popiſh lawes. Your faſting and your feaſt daies, ſmel of that old ſuperſtitiō and idolatrie, & the prophets ſtrengthen the hands of the wicked, that none can turne frō his wickedneſſe. They are all vnto mee as Sodome, and the inhabitauntes thereof as Gomorrah, ſayth the Prophet Ieremiah.
                     
They are not aſhamed of their ſinnes, they hide them not, yea they publiſh them and boaſt of thē, ſayth Eſaiah, yea they cal them good policie, ſo did Sodoma.
                  
                  Take heede. A great light ſhineth vnto Be vvarned, O England Englande. Beware leaſt it be not more eaſie at the day of iudgemēt to the Sodomits, then to the Engliſh mock-goſpellers. But whereas you ſayd Sir Bernard, that you do all for policie, I will tell you what me think were a good point of policie: The Pope & the papiſts count him an Apoſtata, and a renouncer of their faith & Religion, that weareth not ſuch attire as they preſcribe for the prieſt ſecular and regular. Therefore ſeeing the prieſtes and people of England, do profeſſe with mouth, that they renounce the Good coū
                        ſell, and the beſt policy. Popes religion, this ſeemeth right policie, to caſt away theſe garmentes, in ſigne of full deteſtation, that both worde and deede may conſent together. Thus haue good men before vs, giuen vs a paterne of perfect policie. And what a policie woulde they that haue Abbeyes, call this, if the Friers and the Monkes ſhould come agayne to their houſes in their olde popiſh apparaile, and clayme their landes and liuinges, and ſaye they would be no papiſtes: they would ſaye

their Mattins & Euenſong in Engliſh, as the ſecular prieſtes doe: how woulde many of them, like of this policie:

                  That olde Doctor Turner (reuerende in other nations abroad for his great learning, and amongſte the Godly at home, for his great zeale, his trauailes, his perils ſo long ſuſtayned, and his great conſtancie) did almoſte thirtie yeares ago eſpie, and bewray vnto the worlde, the crafte of Satan, that laboured to make poperie policie, and ſo to goe aboute to cure the wounde of the beaſt, which being in it ſelf vncurable, ſhold yet in another beaſt be cured: who ſhoulde doe all thinges that the firſt beaſt could doe before him, and ſo, after a ſort ſhoulde cauſe men to worſhip the firſt beaſt, whoſe deadly wounde, was in this ſeconde healed.

Steuen Gardiner in his booke of diueliſhe Sophiſtrie, maketh the ſubſtaunce of popiſhe religion to ſtande vpon Garments, and ſuch other Popiſhe inuentions, euen as the riche Merchauntes ſubſtaunce ſtandeth vpon farthinges. Is it a good policie (I aſke thee Bernard) to maintain the Popes ſubſtance, and to defie the Pope:
               
               
                  Bern.
                  Nay, fie on that policie.

                  The Pontifical (which is the booke whereby the Prieſtes were made) calleth theſe garmentes veſtitum religionis: Not only putting holineſſe in the garmentes, but alſo meaning, that hee receaueth that Religion, whoſe garmentes hee weareth. But our religion lefte vs by Chriſt, and practiſed by his Apoſtles, is none ſuche. It ſtandeth not in Viſars, ſhewes nor garmentes, but in the power of Gods ſpirite, and the faithfull vttering of his holy worde. The beautie of Chriſte his Churche is inwarde: his Prieſthoode is ſpirituall: the Miniſtration of his Sacramentes muſt bee ſimple,

withoute phariſaicall ſhewe, as hee and his, haue lefte them vnto vs by writing.
               
               
                  Bern.
                  But Miles, I pray thee, Is it not a comelie thing, to haue ſome faire and coſtlie garmentes, in the miniſtration of the Sacramentes?
               
               
                  Mil.
                  No, Bernarde, for that were either Iewiſhe or Idolatrous. And in theſe outwarde ſhewes, they both would exceede vs, Note. for their riches & wealth: and becauſe they put therein their holineſſe, which wee may not doo. But we muſt followe our Maiſter, and not goe before his wiſedome. The garmentes and Ceremonies which once were glorious and commendable in the Churche, becauſe they were appointed of God for a time, did our Maſter Chriſte aboliſh at his cōming, and appointed another manner of worſhippe, than was eyther in Idolatrous Samaria, or amongeſt the Iewiſhe at Ieruſalem. And where doeth hee giue leaue to Peter, or to Paule, or to man, or Angell, to appoynte newe garmentes to ſerue him in, or to miniſter his Sacramentes therein: And if hee giue no leaue to any in his Churche (whome hee will haue to bee kept as a chaſte Spouſe to him ſelfe) to adde,

or to diminiſh his doings, in ceremonies or garmentes: who is hec that dare take leaue to himſelfe, but a companion of the Romiſh Antichriſt? Neither canne theſe thinges rightly be called meere policie, which were a part of the popiſhe religion, and nowe is counted, cauſa ſine qua non, in the miniſterie and in the ſacramentes, the cheefe poyntes of our religion. Are not all depriued of the Miniſterie, that will not be thus diſguiſed? May any other man miniſter the ſacramēts but in this popiſhe apparaile? Is not the courſe of Gods worde ſtopped, that theſe may haue place? Doe not the people think, that neither Mariage, nor Baptiſme, neyther The more is the pitie. the ſupper of the Lorde, can be rightly miniſtred without a ſurples? And what policie call you this, to maintain ſo fonde opinions of the people?
               
               
                  Bern.
                  The Queene doeth commaunde it for policie, not for any Superſtition, howſoeuer the fonde people doe abuſe it.
               
               
                  Mil.
                  Ah that your politicall Proctors eyes are ſo blinded, that they cannot ſee, that ſo long as the ſuperſticious things remain, that ſuperſtition which hath bin ſo long rooted in the hartes of the people (wherevnto man is ſo prone by nature) can neuer be taken

away. And therefore it were a moſt neceſſarie policie for the Queenes Maieſtie, and all Chriſtian Princes, to roote out from the eyes of the people, all the monuments of ſuperſtition & Idolatrie, according to gods commaundement, and the words of the firſt Iniunctions. Thus Moſes, Ezekiah, and Marke this, O ye chriſtian Magiſtrates, and frame your policie to chriſtianitie 
                     Ioſiah, deſtroyed the Idolls, and the Idolatrous monumentes, euen the Serpent ſet vp by Gods commaūdement, a ſigne of Chriſt, and a Sacrament of Gods fauour and mercie. And Iehu killeth the Idolatrous prieſts in their prieſtly garmentes. For none of theſe good Rulers could thinke, that theyr commaundement was able to turne ſuperſtition into policie: neyther had they any ſuch power or authoritie, becauſe God had commaunded the contrarie.
                  Beſides this (to looke vppon the matter rightly) ther is nothing that toucheth Chriſtes religion more neare, than the maner of making of Miniſters, and the forme of the miniſtring of the Sacramentes. Wherefore nothing is further from policie: like as in the appointing of theſe twayne, Chriſtes ſimplicitie is cleane contrarie to humane policie. Therfore is it no marueyle, though mans wiſedome do not like it.

I haue alſo reade in a Booke of that Godly Father Martin Bucer, (whome your ſide boaſteth of ſo muche) that the tenthes and the firſte fruites, taken from the Benefices, are ſacriledge and robberie, though they bee called meere policie. All is not good policie, that beareth the name of policie, For theſe wicked impropriations, pluralities of Benefices, adoration of the Sacrament, excommunication and abſolution for money, & many moe popiſh practiſes, haue nowe the name of policie. But curſed is that policie, that maynteineth any popiſh polling, idleneſſe, ſuperſtition, or Idolatrie.
               
               
                  Bern.
                  Why? may not a King cōmanud ſuch thinges for good purpoſes, that the Pope hath abuſed?
               
               
                  Mil.
                  Both the commaunder & the obeyer Note this. haue theyr limits, in Chriſt, not againſt Chriſt, in the feare of the Lord, not againſt the will of the Lorde, to edification not to deſtruction. Howbeit, it were too long to aunſwere all that maye herein bee ſayde, and the euils are too euident, ſo that muche needeth not. But this muſt all Chriſtian Princes knowe, that the King him ſelfe is bound to haue Gods booke hy him continually,

and thereby to directe his policie, that he turne neither to the righte hande nor to the lefte. For when he caſteth away the worde of God from his policie, there is no wiſedome therein. I coulde tell you further of licences and diſpenſations, and Looke in the ende of this Booke. other Popiſhe Lawes, whiche are couered with the cloake of policie. Howebeit, all this is but a cropping of that Romiſh Rainoldes eares, and ſo to bring in an Engliſh Poperie.
               
               
                  Bern.
                  Nay Miles, you are far ouerſeene, to call this an Engliſh poperie. For you are bound, not onely to obey your Prince, for feare of puniſhment, but alſo for conſcience ſake.
               
               
                  Mil.
                  This ſentence of the Apoſtle, doth bind vs in conſcience, to haue a loue and reuerence vnto our Prince, as vnto Gods Lieuetenaunt, and of a faithfull harte & conſcience to obay him and to aſſiſte him with our bodies, and to ayd him with our goods, ſo long as he doth this office, in maintening good things & good perſons, and puniſhing euil men and wicked doings. For this cauſe doe we paye tribute, ſayth Paule, that the Prince may be able to mainteine the good, and to puniſh the euill, as Gods Miniſter.

For example. All the people were bound to aſsiſte Moſes, in deſtroying the Idolaters, and that Idoll in the wilderneſſe, & to helpe him with their goods, in the making of the Tabernacle: and to ayde Iehu, in deſtroying the Idolatrous prieſtes, and Temple of Baal: and to obey Hezekiah and Ioſiah, in the deſtroying of the Idolles and Idolatrous monumentes in their times. But no man was bound to obeye Ieroboam, Ahab, Iehoram, Ahaz, or any of ye wicked kings, commaunding any ſuperſtition or idolatrie: though for conſcience ſake, becauſe GOD placeth euill men ouer vs for our ſinnes, we may neuer ceaſſe to do our duties towardes them: which is, firſte to giue vnto God our ſelues wholie: then, to giue vnto Caeſar that which apparteyneth vnto him, ſuch tribute and ſeruice, as is requiſite.
                  As cōcerning wicked commaundements, we muſt ſay, That we muſt obeye God rather 
                     Act. 4. 19. 
                     than man. For Iſrael is ſore threatened, that Gods wrath ſhal come vpon them, becauſe they walked after the commaundement of the King. And though Ioſiah had taken away, all the Idolatries and ſuperſtions, which Manaſſeh his Graunfather had ſet vp, and his Father Amon had maintayned:

yet was it ſo farre of, that the cōmandement of thoſe two wicked Kinges, coulde excuſe the people, that notwithſtanding ſome repentaunce in the dayes of Ioſiah, the Lorde turned not from the fierce wrath, where with he was angry againſt Iuda and Ieruſalem, but put them foorth of his ſight, for the ſinnes of Manaſſeh: Whereby wee may ſee, that we may not obey any wicked commaundement of any Prince, vnleſſe we will expoſe our ſelues, to Gods heauie diſpleaſure, as that people did, whiche obeyed the commaundement of Manaſſeh.
                  
                  Wherefore as our conſcience doth binde vs to obey the Prince commaunding good thinges, and puniſhing the euill, ſo doth our conſcience (which ſhall accuſe or excuſe, at the great day) teache vs, that withoute any reſiſting, euen praying to God for the euill Prince, we may diſobey any ſuch commandement, as may in any wiſe withdrawe vs from our duetie towarde God, as we haue a manifeſt example of Daniel, and his three companions, refuſing courtly delicates, and in other their actes afterwarde. As alſo wee haue this playne commaundemente, to abſtayne from all ſhewe of euill. Yet doe wee graunt, as I ſayde before, that in all Godly

policies, wee doe owe obedience in the beſtowing of all that we haue.
               
               
                  Bern.
                  What calleſt thou Godlie policies?
               
               
                  Mil.
                  All Godly policies are furtherances to the keeping of Gods commaūdmēts, wherein the cheefe and firſte is, the preciſe honouring of the true God, and therefore the aboliſhing and abhorring of all Idols, and of all their monuments.
               
               
                  Bern.
                  Is not loue, charitie, and concord, the fulfilling of the law? And theſe are made for loue and concorde, therefore this is a policie furthering Gods law and commaundements, and ſo I heard Maiſter Doctor reaſon with a Miniſter.
               
               
                  Mil.
                  Sir Bernard, I did maruell where you had gotten this Logick and Diuinitie. But firſt I doe aunſwere, that for the keeping Marke vvell this and beare it avvaye. of the firſt table, the loue of God that I ſpake of before, and therefore the deteſtation of Idols and al idolatrous monuments is neceſſarie. And all Princes are bounde to make ſuche Lawes, as ſerue herevnto. Then followeth the loue of our neighbour, as the rule of the ſeconde, whiche loue yet muſt bee in GOD, in Chriſt, and in veritie. For curſed is that concorde that is

in falſhoode, in hypocriſie, in Idolatrie, or briberie. Yea curſed is that concorde, and curſed is that Policie, that hath not Gods worde to warrante it. For it is darkeneſſe and vanitie. What fellowſhip hath lighte with darkeneſſe? Righteouſneſſe with vnrighteouſneſſe? What concorde hath God with Beliall? Chriſt and Antichriſte, the ſincere Goſpeller, and the polluted Papiſt? Wherefore ſeparate your ſelues from them, touche none of their filthie geare, ſo haue you a promiſe, that God will receaue you, and be a father vnto you.
                  There is no ſuche warraunte of youre Proctors policies. And howe canne this be a good policie, to compell the Miniſters of God, agaynſte Gods warrante, to bee like the Idolatrous Prieſtes, and to weare their gariſhe geare? Howe canne they bee like that blaſphemous Prieſthoode, whiche fighte with all force agaynſte that Prieſthoode, and labour by all meanes to aboliſhe it? Or how can this bee a good policie, to bring Gods plagues vpon Englande to ſet Godly men at variaunce, to ſtay and hinder the courſe of Gods worde, to cauſe the enemies, Harding & his fellowes to triumphe, and to waite for an ouerthrowe of both

partes? But the mayntenaunce of theſe ſuperſticious and idolatrous monumentes cauſeth all this, therefore there is in them no good policie, but a manifeſt haſtening of Gods great plagues, that haue ſo long hanged ouer Englande.
               
               
                  Bern.
                  I can ſee no cauſe why Gods plagues ſhould come vpon Englande for this, ſeing the moſt part of poperie is put down, and we liue quietly.
               
               
                  Mil.
                  Is not this a great plague of God Thoſe that knovve not God his vvill, bee blinde, and ſee nor knovve nonothing. thinkeſt thou, that the cheefeſt Goſpellers are together by the eares? one ſpoileth another of liberty and liuing, and the papiſtes true quietly indeed, & laugh in their ſleeues. Is not this a plague, that where there bee ſo few Preachers of Gods Goſpel, in ſo great a realme, the moſt paynefull labourers are put to ſilence by them, that ſhould ſeeke for labourers? And as the Iſraelites deſtroying many of the Amorrhites and Canaanites, according to Gods commaundemente, yet liuing quietly for a while with the reſt, and leauing ſome relikes and remnaunts of thē, by their own negligēce, fond affection, and fooliſh policie, were continually corrupted, polluted, and plagued with theſe wicked remnauntes, by Gods iuſt iudgement: So

is it to be feared here in Englande, that the aboliſhing of muche Poperie according to Gods will, and the reſeruing of ſome ſuperſtitious and idolatrous reliques of the ſame by negligence, affection, or policie to haue quietneſſe, ſhould cauſe this realme ſtill, to be poluted, corrupted, and plagued with papiſtes and poperie.
               
               
                  Bern.
                  If you could prooue theſe thinges ſuperſticious and idolatrous, you ſaid ſomewhat to the purpoſe. But that I cannot ſee.

                  Was there any thing more idolatrous Vnleſſe mē. vvill bee blinde, they muſt confeſſe this. or ſuperſtitious about the Idols, than the diſguiſed garmentes, the Coape and the Surpleſſe, wherein they were cenſed, and ſerued? Were not they ſo miſhapen and altered in forme, from all other garmentes, that they were in faſhion monſtrous, to any other vſe, but about thoſe Idols comberſom and ſuperfluous? Wilt thou be blind within and without? Haſte thou not ſeene them occupied about the idols an hundred times? Agayn, to prooue them ſuperſtitious or idolatrous, ſmall diſputation ſerueth to thē, that will graunt poperie, to be ſuperſtition and idolatrie. For wherein played the Papiſtes all their popiſh pageauntes, but in

                     The ſerpent was accurſed, becauſe it was an inſtrumente of Sathan to tempte Gen. 3. 14. man to ſinne, and ſo is this gariſhe geare, that hath tempted man to ſuperſtition and Idolatrie. Not, but that the ſerpent, and the Diuel alſo, the idoll, and the Idolothite, the Coape or Surpleſſe, and the matters wherof they are made, are good by creation, but in that all theſe are altered from their creation, to bee the inſtrumentes of ſinne, they haue gotten ſtraunge names & formes for the Idols (and ſo the Diuell to be ſcrued therein) ſo are they ſuperſtitious, Idolatrous and abhominable. And for their Cappes and Tippets, were they not for that idolatrous and blaſphemous Prieſthoode, & them that take profite by the ſame, as they are now appointed for you Engliſh Chaplaynes?

                  Though yong ſchollers in the Vniuerſities Marke this, ye Vniuerſitie men. were compelled to weare them as Nouices in the Popes Schoole and religion, and were for the moſt part ſworne to the Pope, by the order of their houſes: yet when they were once maryed, and ſo paſte Popiſhe prieſting, were they Bachelers, Mayſters or Doctors, they ceaſed by order to weare them. Thus at all tymes the idolatrous Papiſtes appoynted this your politicall apparell, for their owne ſworne children. For this cauſe it is ſayd, that Bonner was muche agreeued at thoſe men, whiche were not of his religion, & yet would weare theſe garments and apparaile. For ſaid he, they are Ornamentes belonging onely to our Religion. And therefore after his ſcoffing maner, hee counted them the honeſter men, that woulde not weare them, nor challenge that to themſelues which was none of theirs. If any did forſake the Pope, were he Biſhop or Archbiſhop, they plucked theſe rags from him with all violence, as they did from Cranmer, Ridley, and Hooper, So that it is no good policie, for this Realme of Englande that are enemies to the Pope, and the Pope vnto it, to leaue ſo many Souldiers in their enemies liueries.
                  
                     
Neither is it good policie of the Goſpellers that weare this geare, to continue in that liuerie, forth of the which of neceſſitie, they muſt be turned, by their owne bande, if any Queene Mary (which GOD forbid) raigne ouer vs.
                  But conſider betimes, you that maintain this filthie ware, that there bee many that wayte for it, which will reioyce to ſee you ſtripped out of theſe cloutes, as they haue done at your brethren: and that is ye cauſe, that they holde what they can, of their pope, and ſow ſedition amongeſt the Goſpellers. Therefore I can ſee ſmall policie, and leſſe ſafetie, to ioyne with ſuch falſe fellowes in ſo fonde apparaile. And I would be loth to be matched with ſuche companyons in my charge at Barwick. I cannot hate the enemie, Outvvarde notes to knovve Papiſtes. and loue his Enſignes, and what plainer Enſignes haue we of the popiſh prieſthoode, than theſe garments that you would thruſt vpon the backes, necks, and heads of chriſtian ſouldiers? I abhorre them to the Diuell, as his vndoubted inſtrumentes, to holde the people in ſuperſtition, to cloake a filthie life, and to ſow diſcorde amongſt brethren.

                  But I trow that I haue reade in

Saint Paule, that wee maye not alwayes vſe our libertie to the extremitie, but muſte doe ſome thinges, for feare to offende other mens conſciences: which ſeemeth good policie.
               
               
                  Mil.
                  It is true, the holy Apoſtle Paule ſayth in this maner: Whatſoeuer is ſet before you, eate, asking no queſtion for conſcience ſake. But if any man ſay vnto you, this is offered to idols, eate it not, becauſe of him that ſhewed it, and for the conſciēce ſake, the conſcience (I ſay) not thine, but of the other. Theſe words make cleane againſt you: for firſt he telleth not (as you aleadge) what we muſt doe, but what we muſt leaue vndone, for other mens conſcience. For he teacheth that we may not vſe theſe Idolothites, that is, thinges belonging to the Idols, to offend any mans conſcience, but rather abſtaine from ſuch libertie, and neither eate fleſh, nor do any thing that may offend our brother.
                  Now marke this matter that we haue in hand. Theſe popiſh geare were Idolothites, thinges belonging to Idols, in the wearing whereof, many good mens conſciences are offended, and they openly tell you, that they were thinges wherein the Idols were ſerued,

and that they are greeued to ſee you weare ſuch liueries of Antichriſte, & ſo they are offended in charitie, and can not vſe you as Brethren as they were wonte to doe. Again, the papiſtes, and the weaker ſort, that haue not bin fullie taught, doe ſtill thinke and ſay, and teache others, that theſe are the things that belonged to their Maſſe, and to other popiſh idolatrie, and therefore al their poperie was not euill, ſeeing Chriſtes Miniſters and Sacraments cannot be without them. Thus their weake conſciences are offended in fayth, and thinke their olde idolatrie good, and therefore cannot repent of it. Wherefore for the conſciences of others (if there were no cauſe elſe) you ſhould abſtain frō this libertie, that you chalendge to your ſelues, in theſe idolatrous garments, like as Paule affirmeth, that he woulde neuer eate fleſh, rather than he ſhould be thoughte, willingly and wittingly being once warned, to eate any meate dedicate to Idols.

                  Although I might anſwere thee wt the ſaying of Ambroſe, It is lawful for thee & with ſafe cōſciēce, thou mayſt haue a wife,

yet if ſhe play ye harlot, ſhe is to be reiected, and caſt away from thee. Euen ſo the meate (ſaith he) if it be offered to an Idoll, muſt be ſpit out. This ſentence of Ambroſe agreeth with the decree of the Apoſtles, commaunding to abſtain from idolothites. But Paul declareth that in cōmon vſage, where no mā is offended, we haue a libertie to vſe things that are offered vnto vs, by the courſe and neceſſitie of this life, as the creatures of GOD without doubtfulneſſe. Therefore I do graunt, that the Surpleſſe or ſuch like, may be vſed in cōmō buſineſſes, as to make The Surples may be vſed for a Porters vveede, or ſuch like neceſſarie garment. it a Porters weede, or to lappe ſome courſe thing therein, as did Epiphanius with the vayle at Anablata, or to giue to ſome poore man or woman, that wante clouthes for their children. But to vſe it in the Sacramentes in Gods buſineſſe, is to make all the worlde to thinke, that wee which would ſeeme reformers of Religion, doo but trifle in Gods matters, and that wee neyther doo abhorre Antichriſte, nor his hypocriſie. Therefore, as Iehu did well, in turning the Idolatrous Temples, into iakes, and in polluting the garmentes, with the bloud of the Prieſtes: So ſhould we procede in true reformations, and all the faithfull

Miniſters of God, ſhould be Trumpets to ſtirre vs forwarde, & not clogges to drawe vs backwarde.

                  What, you are to whote and to haſtie, you thinke that Rome may be builded vpon one day. There bee many yet infirme and weake in Englande, with whome the Gouernors muſt beare for a ſeaſon, vntill they bee ſtronger, and that is very good police, ſeeing they cannot reforme all thinges at once. And becauſe ſuch thinges haue bin creeping in by little and little, & haue nowe bin long vſed, they cannot be taken awaye, but by a long continuaunce.

                  Nowe I doe aſke thee in Gods name, if thou doe thinke, that they go about to builde Rome againe, or to deſtroye it? A thing is muche ſooner deſtroyed then builded: or canſte thou tell mee this, howe long they will bee weake? or when all will bee ſtrong? It is almoſt fortie yeares, ſince the Pope and poperie hath bin ſo long written and ſpoken againſt, and about thirty yeres, that his name (as a thing moſt odious) was commaunded by law of parliament, to bee razed out of all Bookes and places in Englande, and the Teſtament of Ieſus Chriſt hath bin ſo long reſtored and publiſhed aamongſt

vs. Now if men be not yet confirmed in the knowledge of Chriſte, agaynſte that Romane Antichriſt, the Pope and his blaſphemous Prieſthoode, when will they be confirmed? when they are fiftie or threeſcore yeares old peraduenture, and haue bin taught ſo many yeares. But you know that the moſt part die before fortie, and who ſhal aunſwere for them? Either howe knoweſt thou that Gods word ſhall continue in Englande tenne or twentie yeares longer, vntill men be no more weake? Either wil you tarry till men learne it in another worlde? Either is God ſo bounde to England, that he will not forſake Englande, as hee hath Remember Qu.

Nay, thou murthering Englande, that haſt ſlaine ſo many of the ſeruauntes of God, whiche called for the fruites of the Lordes Vineyarde, and haſte yet ſhewed no true fruites of repentaunce, but ſworne and forſworne thy ſelfe in ſundrie Parliamentes, and delighteſt ſtil in thy dregges, and hateſt them to this day, that faithfully doe their office: thou

fruites in due ſeaſon: and that alſo which he ſpake to a people of greater holineſſe, than thou art, The Kingdome of God ſhall bee taken away from you, and giuen to a nation that ſhall bring forth the fruites thereof. And O ye time takers, & time waiters, which can finde no time to doe well, alleadging the weakeneſſe of others: beware that it be not your own weakeneſſe, which wold fayne pleaſe both God and the worlde, and therefore ſwim betwixt two waters. Is it not yet time to build and purge Gods houſe, when you haue alreadie builded, ceeled and Looke to this, O ye L. Bishops. trimmed your own houſes? Beholde & you may ſee, in very ſhort time, where zeale and care of religiō is without halting, al things are eaſily reformed after the word of God, & reuerently receaued. Beware therefore, that it be not of your own weakeneſſe, that haue not yet learned rightly to hate thoſe vayne traditions and ſuperſtitious ſhewes of the popiſh prieſthoode, but are content to be in ſuch flauery your ſelues, and ſo woulde haue all others, rather then you will ſuffer any thing for the furtheraunce of the ſimplicitie and ſinceritie of Chriſtes Goſpell.
                  Agayne, O ye politike Gentlemen, you are marueilouſtie deceaued in this point of

policie, that you woulde haue the truth to creepe in by little and little, a little in a lōg Marke this▪ O yee Gentlemen. time, as the ſnaile creepeth or the Serpent, becauſe that after ſuche a flie ſorte, came in Poperie, ſuperſtition and errors. For truth and error are of a nature farre contrarie, for if we doc not receaue the truth and imbrace it readily, and openly profeſſe it at once, the longer we tarrie, the more are wee in daunger to loſe it: Violentirapiunt illud, the violent plucke it vnto them by force. Wiſedome crieth and thou wilt not heare, but makeſt a mock thereat: ſhe will laugh at thy deſtruction, and mock when thy feare commeth. Thou ſhalt call, but ſhe will not anſwere. Thou ſhalt ſeke hir early, but thou ſhalt not finde her. And I pray you muſt Antichriſt ſo ſitte, in Chriſtian mens conſciences, that they ſhoulde make any delay, to receaue Chriſt purely, and at all tymes, and defie all the inuentions of Antichriſte? Or can men ſay for ſhame, that they abhorre that blaſphemous Prieſthoode of Antichriſt, vnleſſe they abhorre all the parts and the appurtenaunces thereof, garments, geſtures and ceremonies? Is he a true Chriſtian man that doth tarry thirtie or fortie yeares to ſee whether the world will change

or no, before that he will chaunge from the traditions of Antichriſt? Or is he a faythfull ſeruaunte to his Lord or Mayſter, that doth think himſelf honoured, and not diſhonoured, Mark theſe ſimilitudes. with the wearing of the liuerie of the manifeſt enemie to his Lorde and Maiſter? Is he a good naturall brother that reſoyſeth to go in the ſame diſguiſed garmēts with the murtherers of his brethren, and wherein yet his brethren are perſecuted? Or is he a louing ſonne to his Father, that will make himſelfe like the mockers of his father, and decke his body with that attire, wherein his father was cuſtomably derided? Nay doubtleſſe, if wee either loue Chriſt, or hate Antichriſt, if we eyther loue God, or his true Miniſters, or beare any affection towards our perſecuted brethrē, we muſt bee more zealous. Wherefore after that it hath bin nowe, for a long ſpace preached againſte theſe relikes of the Romane Antichriſt, they ought vtterly to bee aboliſhed and abhorred: As the Apoſtles, after that they had preached in Antioche, did playnly forbid the filthineſſe of Idols. And if the higher powers will not do it, yet they that haue knowledge, and haue preached againſt ſuch filthineſſe, ought by their deedes

to confirme their wordes, and to keepe their own bodies pure, frō ſuch ſuperſtitions, as they blame in others: and they that haue bin conuerted from Idolatrie and ſuperſtion, haue done this at all times. Surelie it is a taken of great weakneſſe of faith, that men are ſo ſlacke to aboliſhe theſe Idolatrous garmentes. And much more weakeneſſe appeareth, when the Preachers themſelues, do maintaine by their doinges, that, which their wordes denieth.
                  Furthermore, wee doo ſee the fruites of faith verie ſlenderly to appeare, amongeſt the greateſt mainteyners of this hypocriticall Looke into all other reformed churches. geare: and that all thinges do proceede more liuelie both in fayth and in manners, where the weedes of Poperie are vtterlie aboliſhed. And ſurelie, if wee rightly conſider it, we ought not to beare wt, nor to ſuffer any token of Antichriſt, any more than Moſes, Ioſhua, or Ioſiah did of the olde Idolaters, becauſe there may be no concorde, no agreement, no cōmunion, no partaking betwixt Chriſte and Antichriſte, the faythfull and the infidell, God and the Diuell. For whileſt the Goſpellers doo vſe ſuch popiſhe traſhe, they confirme the ignoraunt in theyr errours, and thei comforte the maintainers

of ſuch fooleries, and they hurte the faith of the weake. All this is to prouide for your owne quietneſſe, your owne ſafeties, & your VVhat is this but hypocriſie. owne bellies. For many of you woulde elſe doe otherwiſe, yea and priuately will not ſtick to wiſhe them at the Diuell. And thus doe you gratifie Chriſtes enemies, and ſuch as are but ſhrinkers & traitors vnto Chriſts cauſe. For doubtleſſe there can none other but ſuch ſtriue and contende ſo bitterly, for ye retayning of any popiſh trifles. Although I doe graunt, that ſome of ſimplicitie, or for the wante of the true zeale of Gods glorie, may for a ſpace beare with ſuch apiſh toyes. But to depriue, & to ſpoile of their liuinges and liberties, any one faythfull preacher for the refuſing of theſe, doth declare playnelie, that there is no loue of Gods worde, nor of Gods Meſſengers. And this may iuſtly bring Gods wrath vppon all the commaunders and conſenters therevnto: but eſpecially vpō the Lordly Biſhops, the procurers and executioners of ſuch commaundments, which they ſhould cheefely repulſe, to defend the faythfull Preachers, though it were with the loſſe of theyr liuinges and their liues.
                  O Biſhops, are yee not in this poynte,

Doth not our Maiſter Chriſt ſpeake of ſuch? ſaying: The Mayſter of that Seruaunte will come in a day when hee looketh not for him, and giue him his portion with Hypocrites: there ſhal be weeping and gnaſhing of teeth. Repent ye proude Prelates, and ioyne handes once agayne, with your poore perſecuted Brethren, to roote oute all poperie, or elſe your fall will bee perilous.

                  It is the likenes of maners, not of garmentes, that maketh concorde and vnitie, ſayeth Cicero. And Paule requireth of the Miniſters like doctrine. A man and his wife need not to be put in one garment, neither may they ſo be, though in them be required moſt perfect amitie. Much leſſe needeth the Lambe and the Wolfe, the ſheepe and the Butcher, the Chriſtian and the Papiſt, the loyterer and the labourer, to be ſo matched together, yt one can not be knowne from the other. For this is confuſion and no good concorde. Therfore the Lord commaundeth, that wee ſhould not match together

vnequall things, as the Oxe and the Aſſe, nor to ſowe the grounde with diuers ſeedes, nor to weare a garment of linnen & wollen. All the which things are written to teache vs to beware howe we do mixe & matche together, thinges that haue no concorde, as true and falſe religion, which can haue no more vnitie, than light and darkeneſſe. Ephraim may not mixe his religion with the Gentiles, ſaith Hoſea. No more may the true Miniſters of Chriſte, and the Idolatrous prieſthood of Antichriſte agree together in any wyſe. The holy Apoſtle S. Paule, hauing regard to ſuch matters, writeth thus, as was before noted: Be not vnequallie yoked with the infidels. For what fellowſhippe hath light with darkeneſſe? 
                     2. Cor. 6 14 15. 16. 
                     or, Righteouſneſſe with vnrighteouſnes? What concord hath Chriſt with Belial? or what part hath the beleeuer with the infidell? &c. Wherfore come out from among them, and ſeparate your ſelues, ſayeth the Lorde, and touche no vncleane thinge: So will I receyue you, and I will be a Father vnto you, and ye ſhalbe my ſonnes & daughters, ſaith the Lorde. Loe, in refuſing the fellowſhippe, in flying from them, and touching no vncleane thing of theirs, we haue

God ready to receaue vs, and to ſhewe himſelfe a father vnto vs. Therefore to obtayne this aſſuraunce, we muſt defie the concorde with the papiſtes, and the amitie with all Idolaters, and cauſe them (if it bee poſſible) to turne to vs, but we may turne to them in no caſe. For therefore was Ieremiah the Prophet forewarned, that he ſhould ſtande agaynſt them like a braſen wall, and that he ſhould not feare their faces. So ought we to ſtande agaynſte all this Idolatrous geare, which yet beareth the marks, the names, the formes and faſhion of the Idolatries and ſuperſtitions, wherin, by that blaſphemous Prieſthood they were abuſed. And, how doe you ſtande agaynſte them? Or how doe you flie from them, when you are fayne to hyde your ſelues vnder their Idolatrous Garmentes? Or howe can the true Chriſtians be at concorde with them, who haue a contrarie commaundemente? And what concorde I pray you, was there at anytyme betwixt the true and falſe Prophets? as betwixte Michaiah, and them of his time: Iſaiah, and them of his tyme: Elijah, and the Prieſtes of Baal. Eliiah would needes haue his Altars and ceremonies aparte from them, and derided their doings,

aud cauſed the people to kill them. Ieremiah and the clawbackes, that then liued, had Examples of holy mē, vvhiche deteſted Idolaters, and their fashions and rites. ſmall concorde together. Amos, and the high Prieſte Amaziah were at greate variaunce. Paule and his fellow Phariſeis, had ſmall amitie or concorde together, after that hee once came to Chriſte, for they perſecuted him in all places, and beate him, euen at the iudgement ſeate. Finallie, this is euident to all Chriſtians, that there was no concorde betwixte Chriſte and the Prieſtes, the Scribes and Phariſeyes of his time. And are not the Papiſtes worſe than any of theſe? Can wee haue no concorde, which are of Chriſte, vnleſſe we creepe vnder their Coates, and hide vs vnder their Coapes, Caps & Tippets? Yes doubtles, in me you ſhall haue peace ſayth Chriſte.
                  Let all Chriſtes faythfull ſouldiers, follow Chriſt their Captayne therefore, in all ſimplicitie, and defie that concorde with Antichriſt. The daye ſhall come, that oure Chriſte ſhall ſcourge oute theſe Popiſhe Iohn 2. 15. Chapmen, like Dogges, then ſhall theſe haltinge Neutralles, hyde their heades, whiche fondly patche Chriſte his Religion, with the Popes, and make an Engliſhe Biſhop and an Engliſhe Prieſte of theſe two

orders, ioyning fire and water, heauen and hell together, to make a cōcord. And marke the Monkes and Friers, & thoſe cloſe Maiſters, that dwell in the Monaſteries & great Churches, which are bounde ſo ſtraitelie to keepe conformitie in garmentes, and thou ſhalt finde amongſt the findes of hel, no greater hatred, nor more diueliſhe diſcord. Now contrariwiſe, theſe poore perſecuted men, keepe concord ſo much as in thē lieth, with all men, and followe the rule of Auguſtine, which is, that whoſoeuer (as farre as he is able) doth correct that, whiche is amiſſe, or that which he can not correct, without diſturbance, doth exclude it, or that which hee can not peaceablie ſhut forth, yet with his equitie and well doing, doeth diſalowe it: ſuch a man is peaceable, and free from the curſe. And this in very deede, is the office of all true Preachers, when they can doo no more, yet to reforme them ſelues, & by their vprightnes, to giue example vnto others.

But we reuerence them, and woulde fayne ioyne with them, to the furtheraunce of the Goſpell: notwithſtanding yt in this pointe, we can not allowe them, as alſo we haue teſtimonie of them ſelues, that herein they miſlike their owne doings. And wee aſke this queſtion of them, with what aſſuraunce of conſcience, they do departe from the ſimplicitie One principal queſtion. in Chriſte, wherein they liued with vs heretofore, to take vnto thē agayne theſe knowne liueries of Antichriſt? As alſo how they wil aunſwere at the day of iudgement, this ſpoyle of our Preachers, and this ſtopping of the courſe of Gods Goſpell, & why they do oppoſe them ſelues, & ſtriue againſt vs, who, in their owne conſcience, doo ſeeke to baniſhe the Romane Antichriſte, and all his relikes forth of Chriſtes Church, which is both their and our duties? And therefore we do admoniſhe them in the Lorde, that

they doe not departe from Chriſte and his members, neither ſeparate thoſe from their companies, whoſe doctrine they know and confeſſe to bee ſincere, whoſe life alſo they cannot reprooue. So neyther they nor wee ſhall bee founde ſchiſmatikes, but wee both ſhall come to the true concorde, whereof we are aſſured, whileſt we drawe nearer & nearer to Chriſte, and flie further and further from Antichriſte, a greate deale of whoſe droſſe and tirannie lieth yet hid in their Courts, Coates and Titles, and tirannical oppreſſion of their brethren.
                  We deſire a concorde in Chriſt with you all, but not without Chriſt: in veritie, but not in poperie. And we doe marueile howe you dare departe from the libertie and ſimplicitie, that Chriſt taughte his ſchollers to vſe in the miniſterie and ſacraments, to this ſeruile ſlauerie, to be bound to Antichriſtes traditions, to cauſe ye poore people to think, that the ſupper of the Lord cannot bee celebrated without kneeling, & without Wafer cakes, and that his Miniſters can haue no ornamentes, but Popiſh caps and tippets, idolatrous coapes and ſurpleſſes, plantes which ye heauenly father neuer plāted, which ſhould be rooted out now when the Goſpell

hath bin ſo long preached amōgſt vs, or elſe doubtleſſe this goſpel wilbe taken away frō vs, & giuen to thē that wil bring forth better fruits, both in ye weeding out of ſuch wicked weedes, & alſo in the exerciſe of chriſtiā life. O Lord what a heap of antichriſtiā lawes, cuſtoms & traditiōs, are yet reteined by the Reade the Tables in the ende of this booke. Biſhops? And yet they ſweruing frō chriſt, in ſo many thinges, dare call their Brethren Schiſmatiks. But I do aſke thee Bernard, if yt 
                     Iohn Baptiſt were a ſchiſmatike for departing frō the Leuitical prieſthoode, being born of ye order? or brake he any good order, becauſe he would not miniſter Baptiſme (ye firſt ſacrament of our religiō) in an Ephod, or ſome other Prieſtly Garment? Or was ye baptiſme of Iohn, or of Philip, or of other ye Apoſtles worſe, becauſe they miniſtred it in their vſual garmēts? Either is baptiſme or any other miniſterie, higher in the church than ye preaching of Gods word? which yet your ſelues will not tie to theſe garmentes, as you do the ſacraments? What Egyptian blindneſſe is this? Agayn, was Paule a Schiſmatik, for departing frō the Scribes & Phariſeis? were ye Apoſtles ſchiſmatiks, for refuſing the waſhing of ye hands, & other traditions of the Gouernors? I trowe not.

Neither then are we Schiſmatikes, for departing from the blaſphemous prieſthoode of Antichriſt, the popiſh Phariſees, goe we neuer ſo farre from them, the further, & faſter that we depart from them, the more happie we are. And let all men conſider, that we departe in nothing from the godlie Biſſhoppes, and other learned Brethren, but whereas they do leane to them, whiche are their and our enemies. And ſurelie, he is accurſed of God in this pointe, that either for feare, or fauour, will maintaine any of that Romiſhe harlottrie, to the offence and moleſting of his brethren. Wherefore, I muſt needes here ſpeake, to all that vnfeinedly loue Chriſte, which can not but hate Antichriſte.
                  O ye flocke of Chriſt and faithfull ſouldiers of that heauenlie Captaine, Flie from this paynted harlot, and giue her double 
                     Reue. 18. 4. 
                     for that, which ſhe hath done to you. Delight not in hir gariſh geare. Gods terrible iudgement, ſhall ſhortlie be executed, vppon this ſpirituall Sodome, and vpon al that remayne in it, and vpon them that looke backe therevnto, becauſe they will not receyue naked Chriſt, but that coloured harlot: bringing ſhewes, and trifles, to deceiue ye world,

which can haue no concorde, with the chaſte ſpouſe of Chriſte, no more than can bee, betwixte a pure Virgine, and a filthie harlot, betwixte the milde Sheepe, and the cruell Wolfe. If the Apoſile Paule called it Conciſion which was Circumciſion: & ſaid vnto Peter, that he walked not vprightly, as did become the truth of the Goſpell, for the vſing of a Iewiſh ceremonie: can they imagine that they walke without halting, that vſe yet many popiſh Ceremonies? and ſtill iet vp and down like the Popes Churchmē, in ye Romiſh rags abuſed to Idolatrie? You ran well once when you ran from them, as Paule ſaith to the Galathians of the Iewiſh ceremonies. Therfore doe you run wrong, when you run to them agayne. If you build that whiche you haue deſtroyed, you ſhewe your ſelues tranſgreſſors. Who hath called you backe that you doe not obey the truth? This perſwaſion commeth not of him that called you. A little Leauen corrrupteth the whole lumpe. Theſe curſed patches of Poperie and Idolatrie, make all your doinges vnſauerie. You graunte, the Maſſes, Mattens, Diriges, and whole Prieſthoode of the Papiſtes, to be deteſtable and accurſed. Therefore their Altars, Altarcloathes,

and all their inſtrumentes, and garmentes, are vnder the ſame deteſtation, as the accurſed leauen of that blaſphemous prieſthoode. The golde and ſiluer and other ornamentes are forbidden to bee brought into your houſes. And may you weare them with ſafe conſciences, vpon your backes? May you not bring them into your houſes? And ſhal they be ornamentes in Gods houſe, to his Miniſters, and holy Sacramentes? No, no. We are commaunded, not to ſerue the Lord our God, as others did their Idolles. Finallie, did not God flaye with the ſworde of theyr enemies, his owne people, for this onelie cauſe, for that they kept about them, things belonginge to the Idolles of the Iamnites.

                  O blinde Bayarde, haſt thou neuer read nor hearde, That whatſoeuer is written, is written for our learning? For theſe Iewes are dead, and they that liue nowe, are out of Gods fauour, ſo that theſe hiſtories muſte teache vs Chriſtians, what God hateth. And can we imagine, that God is chaunged? or that hee hateth Idolatrie, or all that to it belongeth, anie leſſe nowe ſince Chriſte came into the worlde, than hee dyd

before? or canſt thou, or anie of thy ſide, ſhewe any cauſe, why God ſhould hate it leſſe nowe vnder the ſight of the Goſpell? Wherefore if God ſo hate it nowe, as hee did then, he abhorreth yet ſtill all the monumentes and inſtrumentes of the Idolatrers and Idolles, as he did then. And therefore doth require all them that wilbe accounted his children, to do the like.

                  Why ſir, if you be ſo ſcrupulous, you muſt burne and conſume al with fire, as Iſraell did the groaues, the altars, & other thinges about the Idolles.
               
               
                  Mil.
                  The Textes of Moſes & Iſaiah, before alleadged, do binde our conſciences to abhorre the Idolles, and their ornamentes, as things polluted, by the abuſe, and abhorred of God: ſo that we may not haue them in honor and eſtimation, in the ſeruice of the true God, as the Idolaters had thē, in theyr Idole ſeruice. Although, as the earth is the Lords, ſo may we make all thinges to ſerue our neceſſitie, doing al in the feare of ye lord, without offence, as Paule dooth expounde this doubte vnto vs. And though in the olde lawe, the outwarde worke of deſtroying of the Idolles, and all their appurtenaunces, was chieflie cōmaunded to that people, & to

their Gouernours, yet the ful deteſtation of all Idolatrie, and of the monumentes and names of idolles, is a law that muſt laſt for euer, in the hartes of the children of God, becauſe God their heauenly Father, hateth it, as a deniall of his Maieſtie, & calleth the creatures ſeruing therevnto accurſed, not in their nature, but in their abuſe, whiche corruption and curſe, can not but remaine, ſo long as the ſame in forme, faſhion, & name, doe remaine, to a church ſeruice, as they did before. Now ſeeing that we know, theſe popiſh garments obtruded to the church, to be ſuch as ſerued to popiſh Idols, and to beare the name ſtil, & the forme of the ſame, which Antichriſtes order hath vſed, & are ye known garments of that idolatrous prieſthoode, in the court and the countrey: haue we not iuſt cauſe to abhorre thē as filthineſſe? To defie them as pollutions? To deteſt them as Idolatrous? For doth not Auguſtin, writing of like matters, ſay thus: I doe charge you before God and his Angels, that you go, neither to thoſe diueliſh feaſtes, which are in the church, and at the Fountaines, or in the groues, & if any thing be ſent vnto you frō thence, abhor it & deteſt it, as though you did ſee therin, the Diuell himſelfe and

refuſe it ſo wholly, that you ſuffer nothing of that accurſed feaſt to be broughte into your houſe. For the Apoſtle ſayeth, that yo cannot drinke the cuppe of the Lorde, 
                     1. Cor. 10. 21. 
                     and the cuppe of the Diuels. Nowe theſe Popiſh garmentes, are patches left of an idolatrous feaſt, worſe in this poynte, than the fleſhe of the olde feaſtes, or the Fountayns, or the Trees, becauſe the formes and names of theſe thinges, were not chaunged. Wherefore if we may not bring them into our houſes, our Miniſters maye not weare them, in the adminiſtration of Chriſtes ſacramentes.

                  Why Miles you are too ſtraight. Chriſte and his Apoſtles did come into the churches both of the Iewes, and of the Idolaters. Therefore S. Auguſtine, will permit more, than you ſay.

                  But it ſeemeth by your former cō
                     munication, of the full aboliſhing of thinges abuſed, to the Idols, that you woulde alſo haue the churches deſtroyed.

                  In the dayes of King Henry the

the eight (the hammer of the papiſtes) they beganne this thing, well in my iudgement. For they defaced and deſtroyed at that time all the Churches that were principally appointed for Idolles, as Walſingham, and ſuch Chappelles, and Abbey churches, as were not buylded for the adminiſtration of Chriſtes Sacramentes, but for ſuperſtition and Idolatrie. Yet ſuffered they to ſtande ſtill, ſuch as were ioyning vppon the ſame walles, as in other places alſo, ſuch pariſhe Churches, as were appointed for the aſſembling of the people, for prayer, and the Sacramentes. In the which, though all was corrupted, yet becauſe of the neceſſitie, that ſuch places muſt be had: Nowe when true prayer is, or ſhould be reſtored, and the Sacraments reformed, the true Chriſtiās may enter into theſe Churches, that were founded for Chriſtian people, as into their owne goodes, holden from them by theeues and robbers, euen as, after the ſame ſorte, wee do plucke with violence vnto our vſage, the bookes of the ſcriptures, which the papiſtes did hide from vs. And thus do we enter into our own poſſeſſion, and put out the theeues marke, that had ſtollen theſe things frō vs. And that is the cauſe, that we may leaue no

marke nor monument of ſuperſtitiō, or idolatrie, in veſtures, or geſtures amongeſt vs, whereby thoſe vſurpers might renewe their clayme in anie wile. Thus did Moſes, Ezechiah, & Ioſiah, and others, that are commē
                     ded in the ſcriptures. For the verie names (and therefore all the gariſhe ſhewes of the Idolles) haue alwayes bin abhominable to the ſeruauntes of God, as Dauid in the perſon of the faithfull confeſſeth. And the Prophete Zephanaiah pronounceth, yt God will cut away from his people, the verie names of Chemarims, and the Idolatrous prieſts, and the remnaūtes of Baal. So that we haue playne wordes, for the deſtroying of all the remnaunts, eſpeciallie the Idolatrous garmentes. For of them ſpeaketh ye ſame Prophete by name alſo afterward: like as Iſaiah named the Ephod which was the prieſts garment: and Moſes commaundeth to ouerthrowe the Altars. Iſaiah biddeth beate thē in peeces, like chalke ſtones. And God himſelfe by many of his ſeruauntes teacheth to roote out Idolatrous monumentes.
               
               
                  Bern.
                  Nay, but theſe are nowe no Idolatrous garments. For the Idols are alreadie taken away, & deſtroyed, & theſe garmentes are nowe commaunded, to be the liueries of

the Engliſh Prieſtes, and to be their ornamentes, to decore the church ſeruice, and the ſacramentes.

                  And I pray you what was Baals Altare? What were Baals Garmentes? What were Baals Prieſtes, after that Idol Baal was deſtroyed? Ceaſed they then to bee idolatrous Garmentes? They were at the leaſte the remnauntes of Baal, whereof Zephanaiah ſpeaketh. What is the Popiſh Altare, the Pixe, and Superaltar, and ſuch other monumentes of the Maſſe (I pray you, nowe when the Maſſe is put downe) but idolatrous monumentes, or idolatrous remnantes at the leaſt? What are the Maſſing geſtures, & maſſing veſtures, but open ſhewes of Idolatrie? And ſhal theſe be ye ornaments of thoſe chriſtian miniſters, yt haue aboliſhed the Maſſe, & all Idols? Eliiah the Prophet, cauſed ye people in the kinges preſence, to kil all ye prieſts of Baal. And thinke you that that King, either woulde or coulde cauſe Eliiah ſtraight wayes to vſe, either the Geſtures or Veſtures of thoſe Idolatrous Prieſtes? That good Prieſt Iehoiada, cauſed No Idolator or his Garmentes to be ſuffefered. the people alſo, to deſtroye the Altare of Baal, and ſlewe Mattan the cheefe prieſt of that Idoll, vppon his owne Altare,

and who durſt cōmaunde Iehoida, to weare that prieſtes geare for an ornament? Now, by what right then, may any of our faithful Miniſters be commaunded, to weare any liueries, or tokens of that Antichriſte, whom they labour to aboliſhe, or of thoſe Idolles, which worthelie are deſtroyed? vnleſſe it be for the ſame cauſe, for the which Iehu giueth ſo great a charge to bring forth ye garmēts, and ſo to trie who will weare theſe poluted garmentes, and then to deſtroye them that will thus diſſemble, in theyr popiſh attire & ornamentes.
               
               
                  Bern.
                  Nay, God forbid, thou art to cruell, thy hande hath bin to ofte in bloud. And doeſt thou not ſee, that theſe garmentes doo make the Miniſters to bee reuerenced and honoured?
               
               
                  Mil.
                  O Bernard, thou lackeſt moe eyes than one, that talkeſt on this fonde faſhion. I would be no more merciful, nor cruell, thā God him ſelfe is: who, if he will haue anie ſinne terriblie puniſhed by death, it is Idolatrie. For there is none that hee more hateth, or for the which he hath giuen greater charge to roote out all remnauntes. And this is moſt playne to them, that haue eyes to ſee it, that there can come no more reuerence,

nor honour, to anie of Chriſtes Miniſters and Sacramentes, by theſe popiſh veſtimentes, than to Eliiah or Iehoiada, by the garmentes of Baals prieſtes.
                  All the Papall ornamentes, are none other thinges elſe, but the Enſignes of his proude tyrannie. And double wicked are they in this pointe. Firſte, that without Gods warraunte, they will weare theſe garmentes. Secondlie, that herein they ſeeke their owne honoures, wherein they woulde ſhewe their holines, and ſhewe themſelues moſt pompous, where thei ſhould appeare moſt humble and abiect.
                  Thus without Gods worde, if our Engliſhe goſpellers, will needes followe the popiſhe pompous Prieſtes, whiche were but Apes to Aaron, and to other gariſhe Prieſtes of the Idolatrers, for to winne thē honour, they ſhalbe Simiarum Simiae, the moſte fooliſh Apes of all other, who hauing Chriſte and his Apoſtles liuelie ſet before To many of this opinion. their eyes, ſtill yet will followe counterfeites, forfaking light for darkeneſſe. Finallie, if anie honour be obteyned, it is this, that the ignoraunt people is made to beleeue, that the olde blaſphemous Prieſthoode,

with their Maſſe, and the Engliſhe prieſthood with their communion, are both one. And ſo it doeth mainteine, the honour and dignitie of the Popiſhe Prieſtes, and their Sacrifice, but it diſhonoureth Chriſtes true Miniſters and Sacramentes. Chriſte our Sauiour and perfecte ſcholemaſter, forbiddeth his, to ſeeke honour by phariſaicall ſhewes. And muſt our Miniſterie ſeeke honour and credite, by popiſhe ſhewes & garments? As for Chriſtes holie Sacraments, they can bee made more honourable, by no mans inuentions, much leſſe by ſuche garmentes whereby they haue bin ſo diſhonoured and defaced by the papiſtes.
               
               
                  Bern.
                  Though they bring none honour to our prieſthoode, (whiche I muſt needes confeſſe conuicted by thy argumentes) yet canſt thou not denie, I trowe, but that they bring a comelie order.
               
               
                  Miles.
                  Thou and thy fellowes can nothing ſkill of Chriſtes Religion, whoſe decencie and order is not outward, in pompe, in garmentes, and in outwarde ſhewes, as is the Papiſtes ordure: (to vſe Souldiours Frenche) for then naked Chriſt in ye cradle, his poore Baptiſme in the Riuer, his poore laſt Supper, of ſo fewe diſhes, with

his poore Apoſtles, his naked hanging vppon the croſſe, ſhould be without order and deſpifed: and ſo they are contemptible, to ye ſence of the fleſhe, & iudgement of the world. But the comelines, in Chriſts religion (my friend Bernard) ſtādeth in ye renouncing of al ye gariſh ſhewes, of the vain world, & in an inward holines of ye minde, which bringeth forth a modeſtie, and ſobernes towards our Brethren, and a zeale, feruencie, & diligence in doing our duties towardes all men, without anie confuſion or tumulte, as our vocation & place ſerueth. And our maiſter Chriſt therefore taketh awaye all thoſe outwarde trifles, that were before his time, as things vncomelie and vnmeete for his religiō. For what a thing were this, to put on a glorious coape for decencie, or a fine rotchet of rains, when a man muſt goe to priſon or burning? Chriſtes Apoſtles, and his true ſeruauntes, are euer readie to ſuffer with Chriſt, ſharpe bondes: and therefore will not mocke the matter with ſilken tippettes, and ſtoles about theyr neckes, as do the papiſtes. So that I doo much maruaile, what decencie, comelines, or order you do cal it, yt the Maiſter muſt be tied with hempen coardes, and the ſeruauntes muſt iette vp and downe in

flaunting ſilkes, and ſarcenettes. I praye thee Bernarde, aunſweare of thy cōſcience: Had this bin a comely ſight to ſee Chriſt on the croſſe, or tyed to a piller, with hempen coardes, mourning for our ſinnes, and Peter and Iohn ſhaken their ſilken coapes, rotchettes and tippettes in the winde, and ſaying, Loe, wee are Chriſtes Diſciples and Scholers?

                  It is a good ſaying, to this purpoſe, that the olde mother Synagogue, was to be buried with honour. But we owe no ſuch honour to the Romane Antichriſt. God did appoynt Circumciſion and other Ceremonies to the Iewiſh church: but that where of Babylon, that made all the Kings of the earth druncken with hir golden cupp and paynted colours, appoynted theſe trifles, to hir baſtardlie broode. And yet Paule rebuked Peter for vſing theſe ceremonies with ye Iewes: and he him ſelf refuſed to circumciſe Titus, when the falſe brethren ſought to reſtraine his libertie, & to bring him into bondage. To ſuch would he not giue place one houre, Gal. 2. 11. And muſt Chriſtes Miniſters giue place thirtie yeares to Antichriſt in his traditions? or yeelde ſo many yeares to them, that labor to heale his wound? God forbid. And Paule did neuer yeeld, nor Peter neither to any Idolaters, whom they cō
                     uerted to Chriſte, to weare their garlandes,

or other prieſtlie attire, to winne any of thē: but alwayes cried, We come to call you from theſe vanities, to turne to the liuing God, and to Chriſt crucified, and to the receauing of the ſpirite, that ye waſke no longer in carnall ceremonies, conciſion, or other beggerlie workes, elementes of this worlde, preceptes of men. &c. And the waye to winne the Idolaters, is (as Auguſtine ſayth, and experience teacheth in many places) to forſake their ſolemnities, and let go God graūt vve may do this frō our hartes. their toyes. Then if they agree not to our trueth, let them he aſhamed of their fewnes. Thus haue they worne out the papiſtes, in manie reformed Churches, and their garmentes alſo: where (by oure ſtaggeringe ſtayes, nowe forwarde, nowe backewarde) thei that beare the faces of papiſts, ſwarme amongeſt vs, and drawe many backwarde, to their madnes.

                     Ridley him ſelfe (which for a ſpace, by ſimplicitie was deceiued, as he in parte confeſſeth in his Epiſtle to Biſhop Hoper) at his death calleth them, abhominable and fooliſhe, & to fonde for a vice in a playe. And howe violently and diſdainefullie, were all good men, by diſgrading, turned forth of thoſe ragges, ſo ſoone, as the patched Papiſtes, came in place? Agayne, the maner of faſte which Iohns diſciples vſed, becing good men (though it were not Idolatrous, as theſe things are) was not therefore to be exacted of Chriſtes diſciples. But rather, for that it was an obſeruation of mans deuiſe, corruptelie abuſed by the Phariſees, no more meete for the ſinceritie of the Goſpell, than olde barelles for newe wine, or newe clothe, for an olde garment, our Mayſter Chriſt did reiect it. So nowe the filling in, and clowting vp of olde popiſh apparell, to the newe purenes of the Goſpell, muſt eyther cauſe corruption, to burſte and to loſe the liquoure that is receyued, or elſe ſeparation, to make the renting of the old from the newe more euident.

                     Lincolniēſis, Robert of Lincolne, that wrote more than three hundred and twentie yeres ago, before any Lord Biſhop, or Biſhoppes

To committe the cure of ſoules to a Boye, or to a wicked or vnlearned They ſvvarme throughout the lād, God redres it vvhen his vvill is. dolte, is the opinion and the pronoūced ſentence of thy Biſhoppe of Canturburies grace. It is inuented by mans fantaſie for moneye, and it is agaynſt the Scriptures, and it is openly taught and publiſhed. For it is with a ſolemne ſeale, caried abroade in writing, and confirmed, and it is ſtoutelie maynteyned. For no man may withſtande it, but hee ſhall be ſuſpended and excōmunicate. Therfore to whō this definition of Hereſie pertayneth, he is an Heretique, whether hee be Pope, or Archbiſhop. This good Biſhop Robert of Lincolne ſaith furthermore, That thoſe Prieſtes or Paſtours, which come as it were, in ye

                  That Texte of Samuell is wrong wreſted, and maketh ſore agaynſt your ſide, for it is, the preciſe obedience, to Gods worde, that is there commaunded, and to adde nothing therevnto, by our fooliſhe intents (as king Saule did) are we there charged. Nowe, for obedience to policie, I doe aunſwere that the popiſh prieſthoode, and the Euangelicall Miniſterie, and the making and appointing of them, and the forme of the Sacramentes are not belonging to policie, but ad cultum Diuinum, only & wholy. In yt which, he that paſſeth Gods worde,

deſerueth Gods wrath, as Saule did, not only by the leauing of the remnauntes of the Amalechites, but alſo becauſe hee was to bolde in Gods buſineſſe, touching the Sacrifice.

                  Paule ſerued GOD with feruent zeale, and a pure conſcience from his progenitors, yet comming to more knowledge, did finde and confeſſe thoſe thinges, to bee hurtfull and vile, which he had eſteemed and vſed as profitable. And albeit that hee had circumciſed Timothie, yet woulde hee not ſuffer Titus to be circumciſed. Euē ſo ſome ſuch as proceede in knowledge and experience, doe finde this apparaile hurtfull and vile, which afore they thought profitable, or at the leaſt not hurtful at all. And albeit charitie did moue thē, to beare with the weake, as it did Paule to circumciſe Timothie, yet faithfulneſſe to keepe the truth of the Goſpell,

                  The Apoſtles of Chriſte, ſeeing a man caſting forth Diuelles in the name of Chriſte, would haue forbidden him, becauſe hee followed not them. But our Sauiour Chriſte ſaieth: Forbid him not. Nowe theſe our Miniſters followe Chriſte and his Apoſtles. Who then dare forbidde them? The Apoſtle Paul ſaith, That ſome preach Chriſte thorowe enuie and ſtrife, to increaſe my bandes, and ſome of good will. What thē ſaith he? Yet Chriſt is preached all manner of wayes, whether it bee vnder a pretence, or ſincerelie, and I therein reioyce, yea and will reioyce. Thou mayſt ſee therefore (O Bernarde) that they are lead with a contrarie ſpirite, that put them to ſilence, who preache Chriſte as purelie as

euer men did, ſince the time of the Apoſtles: the verie Biſhoppes their enemies, being All vpright men cōfeſſe this to be true. taken to witneſſe. What though they will not followe them in popiſhe trifles? Is this a iuſte cauſe, why Chriſte by them ſhould not be preached? Was there euer the like example in Chriſtes Church, that none ſhould preache Chriſte, vnleſſe hee woulde weare ſuch a cappe & a tippet, ſuch a Cope and a Surpleſſe? Of Antichriſtes munckerie, or other corrupte tymes we talke not, neyther in a Chriſtian reformation, maye they be once looked backe vnto. Let them repent therefore, that hinder the preaching of Chriſt, for any ſuch cauſe. For Chriſt wil not ſuffer it vnaduenged.

                  When Peter and Paule were at Antioche, they both did eat meate with the Gentiles. But at the comming of certayne from Iames, Peter fearing them of the circumciſion, withdrew himſelfe, ſo that other Iewes there, and Barnabas alſo, were brought into the ſame diſſimulation. Then Paule withſtoode Peter openly, as worthy of reproche, for giuing of an example to the Gentiles, to keepe Iewiſh obſeruations. Wherefore if right proceeding in the truth of the Goſpel, haue made both theſe parties once to agree, in leauing of Popiſhe apparaile, as it did Paule & Peter, in leauing of Iewiſh rites, and then feare and reſpect of ſome perſons, mooue now the one parte, (as Peter was mooued) to ſhrink back to rites reiected: in ſuch a caſe, the moſt expediente way, to auoyde all daunger, is without regarde of perſon, multitude, feare, or fauour, to keepe and maintayn the truth of the goſpell with ſinceritie and libertie, vnſeparable from the ſame, as did Paule at that time.

Yet this being commaunded and vrged by them, that had authoritie, our Mayſter Chriſt defēdeth the not obſeruing of it, and chargeth the maintainers of it, with the breaking of Gods commaūdements, for their owne traditions, and with hipocriſie, and the blinde leading the blinde. And ſo concludeth (as may appeare euidently) that the authoritie, and obedience of chriſtians, ſtandeth neither in commaunding, nor obſeruing, but rather in rooting vp all ſuperſtitious abuſes.

                  But the caſe ſtandeth thus, that authoritie will not. Nowe if the Prince might be thereto perſwaded, the Biſhops ſeeme, that they would bee glad, to aboliſhe theſe Garmentes, and all ſuch as thou ſpeakeſt of. But if the Prince will force al Miniſters to receaue them, or elſe put them from their liuings and miniſterie: then it ſeemeth better to keepe the miniſterie and liuings, and the libertie of ſincere doctrine, with this apparaill, than without it to loſe all, and to leaue the church deſtitute, and ſo

ſore offende the Prince, that hath reſtored the preachers and the preaching of Chriſts Goſpell.

As for the firſt Minor, that this Popiſhe ordure doeth not edifie, we haue the experiēce in all mens ſight, by Paules Church in London, and the glorious ſhewes there, like as in all the Cathedrall Churches in England, where theſe things are moſt vſed, the people are leaſt edified in Chriſt, becauſe they continewe ignoraunt of Chriſt, being ſatisfied with their olde ſuperſtitious ſhewes, and therefore are moſt vnreadie, and vnmeete to receaue anie profite, by Chriſtes wordes and Sacramentes.

Like as alſo to knowe, what can edifie, & buylde any thing, it is neceſſarie, to bring thinges of like ſubſtance.

The ſuke warme goſpellers know wel inough, that Antichriſtes Ceremonies, that is to ſay, ſuch as haue bin brought in beſides the worde of God, are of no force. And becauſe they are externe things, wherin wee haue libertie, they wil vſe them ſtill: not regarding that many things are laweful, which are not expedient: and that your libertie muſte ſerue others, whome they offende, and alſo obſcure ye glorie of Chriſt. For they confirme the ignoraunt in errour. They make bolde the defenders of thē, the profeſſeth enimies of Chriſt: and thei ouerthrow the faith of the weake.

                  I thanke thee hartilie, I neuer vnderſtoode ſo much Logicke, nor ſo much of this matter before. But yet me thinke the Minors are not ſo euident as the Maiors are, Therefore I praye thee Miles, declare them a litle further, and more euidentlie vnto me.
               
               
                  Mil.
                  I will do it willinglie. For I would faine call thee & all others, to the ſimplicitie of Chriſtes goſpell, from this hypocriſie of garmentes.

                  Why calleſt thou it hypocriſie? Thou ſpeakeſt farre worſe of it, than the London Miniſters do.
               
               
                  Mil.
                  I ſpeake rudelie, like a blunt ſouldiour, but yet truelie. For vndoubtedlie, to make a ſhewe of their profeſſion, howe holie The Apoſtles neuer ſought to bring any eſtimation to theword by apparell. folkes they were, or to gette them reuerence by garmentes, it was a poynte of the Phariſees, or of the Idolaters, of the Chemarims, of Cybeles Prieſtes, of the fonde Philoſophers, as the Cinici or Stoickes, or finallie, of the Heretickes, as the Manichees, the Montaniſtes, or the Neſtorians, and Nouatians. But the true Saintes neuer did it, that we can reade. And our Maiſter Chriſte, his Prophetes and Apoſtles, were moſte troubled by ſuche, as moſt main

tayned this outwarde geare: as nowe are in Englande his chief ſeruauntes, and moſt worthie, faythefull and paynfull Miniſters of his holy worde: with whome I, and manie other that feare GOD, deſire to haue our portion, rather than with ye proude Prelates, that perſecute them, vnleſſe they doo right ſpeedily repent.
               
               
                  Bern.
                  No more of this geare, it is odious. But tell me more of this firſte Minor, howe theſe things do not edifie.
               
               
                  Mil.
                  Though ye proofe ſhould be required rather of thee, & thy ſide, that holde the affirmatiue: yet loe, I refuſe not. And thou maiſt perceaue by my talke, & by all theſe bruites abroade, and by the bitter contention that is fallen amongeſt the learned, that theſe thinges do not edifie. For ſuch thinges as rayſe contention in the Church of Chriſte, do not edifie. Theſe ragges haue raiſed ſuch a contention in England, as neuer was, ſince the goſpell was in Englande. Therefore they do not edifie. They choke the ſynceritie of the goſpell: they ſtaye and ſtoppe the courſe of the goſpell: they declare them to be halters that we are them: they ioyne hands, and drawe the yoke with the wicked Papiſtes: they declare no true ſigues of repentaunce,

whyleſt they are not aſhamed of the ſhewes, of their olde whoriſhe ſuperſtitions: they giue Chriſte a reede in his hande, and attire him with a crowne of thorne, as though hee were vnable to appointe his Miniſterie and Sacramentes without mens deuiſes: they The defenders of thes ceremonies haue their ovvn cōſciences to vvitnes theſe things to be true. take away the differēce of the olde and new Teſtament: they keepe the people in blindneſſe, and in the heauie clogge of cōſcience, that they thinke ſtill, that no Sacramentes are rightlie miniſtred without them: they cauſe Chriſtes ſeruauntes, the true Preachers, to be euill ſpoken of, as the traditions aforetime, did Chriſt and his Apoſtles. Howe dare any man affirme then, for verie ſhame, that theſe ragges do edifie? And if they do ſo, they muſt bring more, than their owne bare authoritie, leaſt they bee founde ſubiect to this ſentence of Iſaiah, Wo vnto them, that ſpeake good of euill, and euill of good: which put darkneſſe for light, & light for darkneſſe. Wo vnto thē that are wiſe in their owne eyes, & prudent in their owne ſight, whiche buylde againe ye things that they haue deſtroyed, and make themſelues tranſgreſſors.

                  Theſe are no carnall paſſions, nor rages as thou ſuppoſeſt. But as my ſayings haue their grounde of Gods holie worde: ſo, None cā be to earneſt in a good cauſe, for God & his Church. I thanke God, I doo feele the zeale of gods glorie, and the loue of my Brethren, leade me thus to ſpeake. And the verie hatred of that Romane Antichriſte, and the griefe of harte, to ſee the godlie Preachers, by this vile occaſion, perſecuted, ſpoyled, and priſoned by their brethren, and rayled vpon by the papiſtes and Neutralles, and their places occupied by ſuch, as will onelie weare Papiſts and the verieſt aſſes moſte redie to the ragges of Rome. the garmentes, may trouble anie Chriſtian conſcience. And marke who are the moſte readie to weare this popiſhe geare. Euen the papiſtes, the moſte enemies of the Goſpell: for they would neuer yet refuſe them, but by their craftie packing, haue cauſed many other, that haue no courage for the trueth, but goe backwarde not forwarde, to turne to them, contrarie to the precepte of God by Ieremiah: Let them returne vnto thee, but return thou not vnto them. And I will make thee vnto this people a ſtrong braſen wall. They ſhall fight agaynſt thee, and not preuayle. &c. Beholde what the way is to edifie: to turne whollie from the wicked vnto God onelie: as the Lorde ſaith

agayne by Ieremiah: O Iſraell, if thou returne, returne vnto mee. Shall my Heritage be vnto me, as a birde of diuers coloures? O ſaieth the Lord by his Prophet Hoſea, Ephraim hath mixed him ſelfe amonge the Heathen. Iſrael is as a cake on the hearth not turned. Agayne, They returne, but not to the moſte Highe. They are like a deceytfull Bowe. Whereby wee maye learne, that the whole turning vnto God, from all ſuperſtitions, and not the patched turning is, that which doeth edifie.
                  The waye to edifie in Chriſtes Kingedome, is deſcribed in theſe wordes: In that daye (ſayeth the Lorde of Hoſtes) I will cut off the names of the Idolles out of the lande, and they ſhalbe no more remembred. And I will cauſe the falſe prophetes, and the vncleane Spirites to departe out of the lande. And when anie ſhall yet prophecie, 
                     Chriſtes church can not avvaye vvith names of Idolatries, muche leſſe vvith their ceremonies 
                     his father and his mother ſhall kill him. And in that daye the Prophetes ſhal be aſhamed of their viſions, neyther ſhall they weare, their roughe garmentes to deceaue. Beholde nowe that the ſpreading of Chriſtes Kingdome, is to take awaye the verie names, and all monumentes and remembraunces of the Idolles, and to make

the falſe Teachers aſhamed of theyr Garmentes, wherein they haue mocked God & his people.
                  Thou mayeſt eaſelie perceaue hereby (Bernard) that to appointe theſe garments as ornamentes for Chriſtes Miniſters and Sacramentes, is not the right waye to edifie Chriſtes people: no more than a ſkarre Crowe can geather Crowes, or a Wolues ſkinne, can pleaſe the ſheepe. Our Sauiour Chriſte, tooke awaye the Garmentes, appointed by his father, becauſe in his ſpirituall kingdome, they could nothing edifie. And ſhall Antichriſtes Garmentes & toyes therein edifie? Chriſte reiecteth al the outwarde forme of worſhippe, both of the Iewes and Gentiles: and ſayeth, That his father will from thence forth bee worſhipped in Spirite and trueth. And he knew the beſt of al others, what could edifie.
                  Furthermore, thus bitterlie to ſtriue for the mayntenaunce of Popiſhe garmentes, after the Pope is baniſhed: for maſſing garmentes, after the Maſſe is aboliſhed: for the ragges of that Idolatrous and blaſphemous Prieſthoode, where wee ſaye, It is deteſted and abiured, it is a great madnes. Therefore it can not edifie.
                  
                     
And this mayntenaunce of the monuments of their olde ſpirituall fornication, doth declare that men haue not yet repēted of their olde ſpirituall fornication. Wherefore this doeth not edifie. No (of the contrarie) it maketh to edification, to bring the popiſhe prieſthoode into full deteſtation. But that can neuer be, ſo long as their garments are appoynted by authoritie, to bring honour & reuerence, to Chriſtes miniſterie, and Sacramentes: the ſtrumpettes gariſhe geare, to attire the moſte chaſte Virgine: Antichriſtes whoriſhe ſmocke, to Chriſtes pure ſpouſe, howe can this edifie?

                  Why? doubteſt thou of that? They are not of God. For it is not written in Gods booke, that the Miniſters of GOD, ſhould weare the garmentes of the Idolatrous prieſtes: but the contrarie, as is partlie declared, and ſhalbe made more playne hereafter. Therefore not being of God, they muſt eyther come from man, or frō the Deuill, or from both together.

                  Nay, there be many things, that are left indifferent: as all the creatures of

God, may be indifferently vſed, or not vſed. And therefore by authoritie may bee commaunded.

                  Beſides that in matters of Religiō, Indifferent thinges made intollerable four vvayes. mens commaundementes are vayne: There be foure things which may make things indifferent by creation, not indifferent to bee vſed of Chriſtians. The firſt is, If that they 1 beare the markes of the Idolles, as ſtraūge formes, onely vſed to yt purpoſe: or ſtraūge names vſed onely in the idolatrous ſeruice, as Cope, or Surpleſſe. The ſeconde, if they be by vſage ſuperſtitious: ſo that vnto them 2 is attributed any kinde of holineſſe, as thoughe without them, the ſacramentes coulde not be miniſtred. Thirdly, if they be commaunded 3 againſt chriſtian libertie, to bring Chriſtian men into bondage, that they may not refuſe ſuch thinges, as are againſt their conſcience. Fourthlie, if they giue any offence. In the which foure things, againſt 4 theſe garmentes, we may take exceptions. And for theſe and ſuch like cauſes, the Apoſtles forbadde both Iewes and Gentiles, euen all the Chriſtians, things offered vnto Idolles, in their firſte Decrees: to teach by theyr factes and deedes the ſame, that they had ſpoken in wordes: that the Idolles and

al that to them belonged, ought to be abhorred of all true Chriſtians. And therefore in the ſame place, it is called 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , the filthines of Idolles.
               
               
                  Bern.
                  Paule giueth leaue to eate ye meate offered vnto Idolles, afterwarde.
               
               
                  Mil.
                  Yea, after this there aroſe a doubte amongeſt the brethren, whether they might eate ſuch fleſhe, as was ſolde in the market, and ſo eaten at the tables amongeſt other meates, vnknowne to haue come from anie Idole. Which was a farre other thing than the vſing of theſe thinges about the Sacramentes. To this the Apoſtle aunſwereth, that as the earth and all that therein is, belongeth to the Lord: ſo may man vſe al meates, & creatures, receiuing them wt thankes giuing, at the Lordes hande, to his glorie, without anie further care, whēce they come, ſo that none be thereby offended. But if any man do tell thee, that it is a thing once dedicate to the Idolles, thou mayeſt not vſe it. And hereby it appeareth, that the creatures (though they haue bin abuſed) that beare no name, nor forme of any abuſe, neither giue Note this. offence by the vſing of thē, may be reteined. But if they haue the forme, ſhewe, or name of things Idolatrous, they are to be abhorred

for two cauſes. The one, leaſt we ſhould ſeeme, to haue any part or communion with 1 the Idolaters: which were againſt the glorie of our God. The other, leaſt the weake brother be boldened, to vſe the thinges ſacrificed 2 to Idolles. And ſo thy weake Brother periſhe, thorowe thy knowledge, for whome Chriſt died.
                  Thus may we note two ſortes of Idolothites, or things belōging to Idolls, Some Tvvo ſorte of Idolothites. haue their names and formes chaunged frō common vſage, and ſo by forme & name, do retaine, the memoriall of the idolles: whoſe 1 names and memorie God will haue to be aboliſhed. Such are properlie called the monumēts of Idolatrie. Theſe ought by Gods lawe and mans lawe, here in Englande, to be done awaye, or with diſhonor, at te leaſt, to be defaced. The ſeconde, are ſuch, as neither are altered in forme nor name, the whiche 2 may ſtill be vſed: as the fleſh ſolde in the market, and eaten at the table, & theſe maye Nota. be called indifferent: ſo that in the vſe of thē, no brother be offended, nor againſt his conſcience vrged. But the creatures that are called gods, are accurſed and maye not be vſed. All the Idolles were creatures, yet by Moyſes & Paule they are called Diuels.

Therefore the partaking with them, is the partaking with Deuilles: and the verie places, where the Idolles were worſhipped, were deteſtable, and are called hell afterwarde. Their great Idoll, wherevnto King Ahaziah ſent, in honor called Baalzebub, by his worſhippers, was, by the godlie Iewes that hated Idolatrie, called the chiefe of the Deuilles, and ſo his name continued. Such hatred did they beare to all thinges apperteyning to the Idolles. Therefore biddeth Moſes to deſtroye all thoſe Idolatrous monumentes. And Iſaiah biddeth vs to counte their idolatrous Ephod (which was ye chief garment of their Prieſt) as a menſtruous cloute, and vtterlie defie it. Therefore this geare, that beareth the names & formes ſtill of their Idolothites, can not bee named amongeſt the things indifferent, though we graunt the ſubſtaunce, and matter of them, of it ſelfe indifferent: neyther can they bee commaunded to be vſed in the miniſterie or Sacramentes, which are matters of Religion in any wiſe.

                  Yes, If the Prince commaund it.

                     Gideon was a Prince, who made and commaunded an Ephod, a riche robe, or garment for a Prieſte, and appoynted it

for his citie Ophra. But this was the cauſe of the deſtruction of him and his houſe. For as we reade Abimelech, the ſonne of his Concubine, did vſurpe the Kingdome, and did ſlaye ſeuentie and niene of his brethren, the ſonnes of his Father Gideon, vpon one ſtone. Then this Abimelech, after hee had Good intenrs vvithout vvarrāt diſpleaſe God. thus cruellie ſlayne his brethren, & his Mothers kinred that had ſet him vppe, and deſtroyed the Citie Shechem, that had made him King, he had his deathes wounde by a Woman, yet woulde hee haue his Page to runne him thorowe, with his ſworde moſte deſperately, & ſo the whole familie periſhed moſte miſerablie. And no man can alledge any other cauſe againſt Gideon, but onelie that which the holy Ghoſte giueth, that hee made this Prieſtes garment, and appoynted it for his Citie, without any warraunte of Gods worde, of a good intent onely. So ſore and perillous a thing it is, to deale in Gods matters, by mans fantaſie.
                  
                     Nadab and Abihu, for the taking of fire, which God had not commaunded, were ſodenlie burned with fire from heauen. Vzza was ſodainlie ſlaine, becauſe he would helpe forwarde Gods worke, by his good intent, without Gods warraunte. King Saul dealeth

in ſacrifice (a matter of religion) without Gods commaundement, but (by ye ſame wiſe policie, that is alleadged for the garmentes) to reteyne the people together: yet for this cauſe loſeth he his kingdome. Alſo King Vzziah is ſtriken with Leproſie, and caſt out with ſhame, becauſe he dealeth in ſacrifices (matters of Religion) without gods worde, by his Princelie authoritie. Thus God will haue the Princes to knowe, that they are but men, & therefore that they may not medle in his matters, without his word and commaundement. For as Samuel ſaid to Saul, ſo ſaieth he ſtill vnto all: Hath the Lorde as great pleaſure in Sacrifices, as when his voyce is harkened vnto and obeyed? Beholde, to obeye is better than ſacrifice: and to hearken, is better, than the fatte of Rammes. For tranſgreſſion and rebellion againſt Gods worde, is as witchcrafte and idolatrie. Wherefore thus ſaieth God by his ſeruaunt Moſes, to Kings & to al others: That whiche I do commaunde thee, that onelie ſhalt thou do: thou ſhalt put nothing too it, nor take nothing from it. Loe, this is the grounde of true Religion.
                  And in matters of policie alſo, ther muſt be ſome diſcretion. For the Prince commaunded

the two Captaines and their hundred ſouldiours, to fetch Eliiah vnto him, a thinge that may ſeeme indifferent, but the fire of God deuoured them. So Kings haue their law howe farre they ſhall commaund. And the ſubiectes by the ſame may knowe, howe to obey. For God when he ſetteth vp Princes, hath not giuē ouer his owne right and authoritie. They are but his ſtewardes and Bayliues, to ſee his will executed, in al things, not their owne luſtes and pleaſures. In euill commaundements therefore to diſobey them, is none iniurie vnto them.

                  Me thinke I ſmell a ratte in this geare. All is not golde that glittereth. But I pray thee tell mee, howe thou doeſt proue them, preceptes of men, as thou waſte about to doo.

                  I ſay they haue no ground of gods worde, therefore they are preceptes of men. God neuer limited anie ſeuerall garment for his Miniſters to bee knowne by, in the newe Teſtament, therefore they are playne preceptes of men, and plantes by the heauenlie Father not planted. The papiſtes them ſelues wil graunt them to be precepts of men. Me thinke therefore, the goſpellers ſhould not denie it.
               
               
                  
                  Bern.
                  They denie that they are ſuch preceptes of men, as Chriſt ſpeaketh of, to be brought in, for Gods ſeruice in religion.

                  Amongeſt the papiſtes, they were brought in, and are vſed for his ſeruice, in religion, as their owne bookes and doinges do teſtifie. Nowe the papiſtes are men: who according to ye diuerſitie of their ſectes, Regulare and irregulare, appointed the diuerſitie of garmentes: ſome for the church, ſome for holy water, as the Surpleſſe, Stole, or Tippet: ſome for cenſing the Idolls, as the Copes: black for the dead: redde for ye Martyrs: white for the Virgins. Nowe all theſe ſuperſtitious trifles, are preceptes of euill men: therefore of men.
               
               
                  Bern.
                  But not in Gods ſeruice & religiō.
               
               
                  Mil.
                  I do graunt. For God will not be ſerued by ſuch thinges: neither will Chriſte allowe them in his Religion. And therefore are they preceptes of men, hauing no allowaunce of Gods worde: nor of Chriſtes Goſpell, who neither careth for theſe garments: nor any other popiſhe ſhewes, in the miniſtration of his holie Sacramentes, or anie action of his Religion. Neyther doe they ſette forth the glorie of GOD, nor his worde, nor profitte, but hinder the ſoules of

men from the true ſeruice of God in Spirite and trueth. And as alwayes, wicked men haue moſt vrged their owne preceptes: Theſe traditions more vrged then God his cōmaū
                        dementes. ſo at this daye theſe preceptes are more vrged, than Gods holie commaundementes. Would to god there were not to manie exā
                     ples, both in the Cities & in the Countries, to proue this matter true. To weare a veſtiment, is a precepte of men. And why not a Cope? An Albe is a precepte of men: and why not a Surpleſſe? A Stole is a precept of men: and why not a Tippet? &c. Al patches of Poperie, are preceptes of menne. Therefore the prieſthoode, being taken away, (as the Authour to the Hebrewes ſayeth) it is of neceſſitie, that the lawes pertaining to the Prieſthoode, ſhoulde be taken awaye. So that if this were a lawe pertayning to the popiſhe prieſthoode, to weare a Surpleſſe at the miniſtration of the Sacramentes, and at the ſaying of their Mattins, or their Euenſonge in their religion, nowe ſhould it ceaſe from amongeſt them, which haue renoūced that popiſh & blaſphemous prieſthoode, and that falſe religion: whoſe body and ſubſtaunce (if they wholie hate) they muſte needes abhorre all the patcheries that appertaigne to ye ſame religiō.

For the popiſhe prieſthoode is like the lowſie and patched cloake of a filthie begger. Patcheries of popishe remnaunts a

Nowe, what a fondnes were this for two wiſe men, or for thee and mee, that pytying a poore begger, had pulled off his patched cloake from him, to giue him a better: and afterwarde we twayne ſhould fall together by the eares, and the one caſte the other in priſon, for the refuſing to weare, thoſe lowſie ragges:

                  Surelie I would be loth to bee in thy companie, if thou ſhouldeſt weare anie patches of that lowſie geare: therefore I would be loth to cōpel thee to it by priſons.

                  Loe, here is the ſtrife, betwixt our Goſpellers. They haue put downe that patched popiſhe Maſſe, yet will they haue lowſie patches of it. For the Surpleſſe is a Maſſing garment, by the Papiſtes owne bookes. They haue put down that Antichriſtian prieſthoode, and they will fight for his coates. They are farre more fooliſhe, than our fellowes the ſouldiours, that when they had killed Chriſt, caſte lottes for his coate. And I tell thee, Bernarde, thou ſayeſt that thou ſhouldeſt loth my companie, if I dyd weare the lowſie patches of ſome begger: and ſo I tell thee playnelie, that I doo lothe

thee and all thy companie, when I doo ſee you, in the lowſie ragges of poperie. Yet do I not hate you, for thē would I let you alone But I tell you my minde plainely, becauſe I loue you, and ſeeke to do you good.

that Chriſtes appoyntement of his Miniſterie & Sacramentes, are not decent ynoughe without ſome of the Antichriſtian leauē. Agayne, thou boldeneſt others, to occupie other patches of poperie, while it thou vſeſt theſe, and buyldeſt them vpp to ſuperſtition agayne. And ye giue them to thinke, that you do not abhorre that blaſphemous & Idolatrous prieſthoode, whoſe garmentes ye weare. Yea the Biſhoppes com

Again, your offences in charitie are manifeſt. For beſides the men that you ſpoyle of their liuings, howe many women and children, haue cauſe to be offended with your cruell cōmaundement about this geare: And all that be growen to ful ſtrēgth in the goſpel, & haue their ſenſes exerciſed, to ye diſcretion of good & euil, are grieuouſly offended, when they ſee them that haue ſo long a tyme bin teachers, and preachers agaynſt Antichriſte, not onelie weare ſuche ſuperſtitious apparell, but compell others by tyrannie, to come into the ſame bōdage.
                  
                     
Moreouer, you giue offences both of faith and charitie, when as you ſtabliſhe the Papiſtes in their olde erroures: and cauſe them to ſaye, That the Goſpellers, can not miniſter their Sacramentes, nor haue anie miniſterie at all, but of their leauinges.

Euen as it is reported that Butcher Boner ſaide: They beginne to taſte of our Pottage, they will ſhortelie fall to the fleſh. Thus they are moſte offended with this Popiſhe ware, that beſte doe like it. For they are confirmed in theyr malice, and ſuperſtitions: and are boldened to doe that, whiche is without fayth (and therefore is ſinne) and whiche is without the warraunt of Gods worde, and therefore muſt needes be done with a doubtfull conſcience. Thus Papiſte and Goſpeller, weake and ſtronge are offended, ſome in fayth, ſome in charitie, by theſe patches of poperie, and lowſie Romiſhe ragges.

                  Thou vſeſt thy tearmes to ſpitefullie, yet thus to call them. For if they were lowſie, I woulde not weare them, I promiſe thee.

                  Bern.
                  Let goe theſe wordes, and come to the fourth poynte, howe theſe thinges are againſt the Scriptures, or beſide the Scriptures.
               
               
                  Mil.
                  They are beſide the ſcriptures, becauſe that no manner of appoynted apparel for Chriſtes Miniſters, nor anie ſacramentall garmentes, are once named in the newe Teſtament: which is a booke all ſufficient, to inſtructe vs to all well doinges. By the which we may learne, what Chriſt required of his Apoſtles, and what ſimplicitie they vſed in their garmentes, and ceremonies, & vſage of their ſacraments. And this is moſt playne, that they borowed no garmentes of the Idolaters, that they had conuerted vnto Chriſte: which is the ſcope of our Diſputation. For this is the queſtion, as it is nowe in controuerſie: Whether it be againſt, or beſides the ſcripture for them to weare the garmentes of idolatrous prieſtes, that haue bin the meanes, to beate downe their Idols, and to baniſhe their Idolatries? The queſtion alſo may runne further: Whether anie true Biſhoppe of Chriſte, may compell his

fellowe Biſhoppe, and fellowe Miniſter, by priſon ſo to do? But this declareth Rome to be come home to our gates, and Chriſtian libertie in this point, to be vtterlie baniſhed. Therefore I will not nowe medle with it. Howe beit, I do aunſwere to yt former, that, if Paule called all the carnall and outwarde holines, and all that he might truſte in, concerning the fleſh, vnder Moſes lawe, donge, loſſe, and droſſe, for Chriſtes ſake: then muſt all yt Idolaters (be they papiſtes or others) counte all their hypocriticall ſhewe of holineſſe, dunge & droſſe. And that they ſhoulde do ſo, GOD by his Prophete Iſaiah doeth teache thē, to deteſte and deſtroye into powder, thoſe things that were about the Idols moſt precious. And ſayeth, that this ſhalbe the token, and fruite of the taking awaye of their former ſinnes, when they ſhall make al the ſtones of the Altars, as chalke ſtones, broken in peeces, that the Groaues & Idols may not ſtande. Againe ſayeth he: Pollute the couering of the Images of ſiluer, & the Ephod of the image of golde: and caſt them away, as a menſtruous cloute, and ſay vnto it: Gette thee hence. Wherefore I aſke thee, if thou thinke of cōſcience, that Iſarah could ſuppoſe, that the little ragges of the

Idolles, ſhould be kept in reuerence, for comelineſſe, and to beautifie the miniſterie & ſacramentes, when he had giuen ſuch terrible charge againſt the greateſt?
                  Nowe furthermore, becauſe theſe prieſtlie garmentes were carnall ſhewes of the papiſtes, they are dunge and droſſe, and ſo beſide the ſcriptures. But as they are Reliques and ragges, belonging to the moſte blaſphemons Altars and Idolls, ſo are they againſt all the ſcriptures, that commaunde the vtter aboliſhinge of Idolatrous remnauntes: whereof I coulde alleadge manie places. Therfore as the wearing of the garmentes, of the Chemarims, of the Prieſtes of Baal, or of Mahomet, in the miniſterie, and in the ſacraments, were beſides, or contrarie to the ſcriptures, if anie of theſe ſhuld be commaunded, for decencie and order. So theſe popiſhe garmentes, are beſides, and contrarie to the ſcriptures, becauſe the Idolatrie of the papiſtes, hath bin as wicked, and abhominable before God, as anie of theſe. God alſo ſayeth by his Prophete Zephanaiah, that he will cut out, the remnaunt of Baal, and the names of the Chemarims, and the prieſtes, and all thoſe that are clothed with ſtraunge apparell. Therefore

it is beſides or agaynſte the ſcriptures, to mainteyne ſuch remnauntes of ſuch prieſts, and ſuch ſhewes of ſtraunge apparell borowed from the Idolaters. The Prophete Hoſea teacheth, That the people of God, may not mixe their religion with other people. Therefore it is beſides, or agaynſt the ſcripture, to mixe our true religion and ſacramentes with the doings of the papiſtes. Zachariah ſayeth alſo, That the falſe prophetes ſhalbe aſhamed of their viſions and garmentes, wherein they haue deceaued.
                  Therefore it is beſide, or againſte the ſcriptures, to compell Chriſtes Miniſters to weare them. And though ſome libertie bee permitted by the ſcriptures, for the Church to appointe ſome orders, yet are the boundes ſo limited, that all muſt be, to the glorie of God, and to edification, nothing ſuperfluous or triflinge, nothing ſuperſtitious, nor idolatrous. For ſuch thinges, are againſte Gods glorie, againſt the ſcriptures of God. and contrarie to edification, as thou haſt hearde.

                  If thou be able to proue, the commaundement of theſe thinges, ſo playnelie to bee agaynſte Chriſtian libertie alſo, whiche is the fifte poynte, thou wilt almoſte

perſwade me, to ſpeake no more againſt the London Miniſters.
               
               
                  Mil.
                  That is a thing moſte euident, and therein I doubt not but that we ſhall agree: For to binde a man to doe agaynſt his conſcience, is againſt Chriſtian libertie: but thereto are manie driuen, by this commaū
                     dement, therefore it is againſt chriſtian libertie. The conſcience muſte haue Goddes worde to warraunt the actions. But Gods worde doth not warraunte vs to vſe theſe idolatrous geare, but playnlie forbiddeth the ſame. Therefore man can not haue his conſcience perſwaded, that this ſtandeth with chriſtian libertie. Agayne, to commaunde men, to abſteine from ſuch thinges, as were knowne to belonge vnto Idoſles, which are called, Idolothita, was the advouchinge of Chriſtian libertie, and the declaration, that they were no longer vnder that Idolatricall ſlauerie, wherefore the Apoſtles commaunded it at the beginning. Therefore to bee bounde to vſe theſe thinges, is againſt chriſtian libertie. As for the vſe of the matter, or ſubſtaūce of ſuch things, either vnknown or of ſome neceſſitie, I haue tolde thee before, that ſo the creature is indifferent. And to knowe this, is one pointe of Chriſtian libertie,

like as to flie from Idolatrous bondage, and to teache others to do the ſame, is the practiſe of true chriſtian libertie.
                  Furthermore, to binde men vpon the perill of liuinge and libertie, to weare thoſe garments, wherein their heauenlie Father hath bin blaſphemed, Chriſtes death derided, his Sacramentes polluted, theyr Brethren deceiued and murthered, in ſoules and in bodies, declareth a verie ſmall ſemblance of Chriſtian libertie. The holy Apoſtles, commaunde men to abſteyne from the filthineſſe of Idolies, meaning by that worde (Filthines) that they coulde haue nothinge to doe with anie thing belonging to the Idolles, but that they ſhoulde be defiled. So doth Paule call the Idolles, Deuilles, and ſayth, that they that eate of their tables, are partakers with the Deuilles, and counteth them partakers of the altar, and ye ſame religion, whereof they are partakers, in the Idolothites.
                  Nowe, theſe garmentes which in poperie haue belonged to Idolles, are filthie Idolothites, that ſerued vnto Diuelles. Therfore are they agaynſt Chriſtian libertie. Againe, to binde men to eate Idolothites, were againſt Chriſtian libertie: therefore to binde

men to weare the Idolothites, is agaynſte Chriſtian libertie. To commaunde them to weare Garlandes, Palmes, Hattes, or eareringes, like the Idolatrers, were againſte Chriſtian libertie. Therefore to binde them to couer all their bodyes with Idolatrous garmentes, is agaynſt Chriſtian libertie. To binde men to obſerue Iewiſhe Ceremonies, were agaynſt chriſtian libertie. Therfore are ſuch commaundements, in the ceremonies, of Antichriſt, agaynſt Chriſtian libertie. Poperie is bondage and ſlauerie. And the binding of the Miniſterie, and the ſacramentes, to ſuch preſcript apparel, was parte of the thinges, whereby menne were chayned in poperie: therefore are they agaynſt Chriſtian libertie. Wherefore wee muſt ſtande faſte in the libertie wherewith Chriſte hath made vs free, and flie from the yoke of bondage, of that Romane Antichriſt. We muſt goe out from that whore of Babylon, that wee be not partakers of hir ſinnes, leſt we be partakers of hir plagues, and giue hir double, for that ſhe hath giuen vs. Loe, this becommeth chriſtian libertie.

                     dation, yet muſt needes this chaffe & droſſe (as they them ſelues cal it) be burned from them, by the fire of Gods iudgement. And ſo by faith and repentaunce, they may be ſaued: howbeit not without ſome ſmell of the fire, as God by his wiſdome ſhal meaſure it.

                  Mil.
                  O Bernarde, thou ſpakeſt a worde in the beginning ſcoffinglie, whiche is thy whole charge, Paſce, Paſce, Paſce, feede my ſheepe, feede my flocke, feede my Lambes, if thou loue me, ſaith Chriſte to Peter, and to all that take charge of any congregation. Therefore doeth Peter deliuer the ſame charge ouer vnto others, whome he calleth fellow Elders, & admouiſheth them to feede

the flocke of Chriſte, as much as lieth in them. And Paule counteth all that are called to this ſtate, the Miniſters of God, and the Stewardes and Diſpoſers of his treaſures, and ſayeth in his owne perſon, that which he will haue to bee vnderſtande of others: Woe vnto me, if I do not preache the Goſpell. For a ſtewardſhipp is committed vnto me. Therefore ſaieth he to Titus, that a Biſhoppe or a Miniſter of Chriſte (for theſe two are confounded in the ſcriptures) muſt be Gods ſtewarde, holdinge faſte the worde of faith, according to doctrine, that he alſo may be able to exhorte with wholeſome doctrine, and improue them that ſaye againſt it.
                  Lo, Bernard, this is Chriſtes firſt marke of his Miniſters, that they feede his flocke, with the wholeſome doctrine of his worde. Secondlie, it is required, that they whiche muſt reproue others, muſte be vnreproueable them ſelues, that they be watch full, modeſt, herborous, apte to teache, &c. as Paule writeth to Timothie. Theſe be Chriſtes liuerie garmentes. And what pitious caſe is this, in Chriſtiā churches, to ſee men thruſt out of the dores, and robbed of liuing, and libertie, that haue all theſe markes and liueries?

And to haue ſuch men called in and cheariſhed, that haue none of theſe, but onlie can reade a little in the Churches, and iett vp and downe idellie in the enemies liueries, as thou maiſt perceiue (deare friēd) by thyne owne ſelfe.

                  Why my friende, muſt euerie Miniſter or Prieſte be a Preacher? Muſt I be a preacher alſo?

                  The ſcriptures of God, admitte none other, as thou haſt partly hearde, and more euidentlie may be proued, howe the lippes of the Prieſte (as Malachi ſaieth) muſt keepe knowledge, and they ſhal ſeeke the Lawe at his mouth: For he is the meſſenger of the Lorde of Hoſtes. Loe, thou and euerie one, that taketh this office in hande, are appoynted meſſengers of the Lorde of Hoſtes. If thou eyther know not this meſſage: or canſte not ſpeake it, or wilt not do it, what a meſſenger art thou? Doeſt thou not on Gods parte (whoſe glorie, power, iuſtice, and mercie, thou ſhouldeſt preache) deſerue ſharpe puniſhmente? And of the parte of men, ouer whome thou haſte charge, and to whom thou art ſent as meſſenger, thou deſerueſt that their bloud

ſhould be required at thy handes.

                  O would to God, that thou, and all thy fellowes, would turne whollie to Gods worde, and leaue your triflinge hipocriticall ſhewes. So ſhoulde GOD be glorified, and Chriſtes Congregation edified, which nowe by the diſplacing of the godlie learned Miniſters, is pitiefullie moleſted and daungered. What a Decree is this, That no man ſhalbe admitted, a Miniſter of Chriſte, vnleſſe he will admitte alſo and Subſcribe to ſome, yea and manie of the miſorders of Antichriſte? And as I heard a Biſhoppe ſaye, If it were Paule himſelfe, hee ſhoulde not here bee ſuffered, vnleſſe hee woulde bee conformable to this geare?

moſt francklie againſt all ſuperſtitious ceremonies. So do theſe. Paule was coūted a foole in ye world: ſo are theſe. Paule counted al the phariſaical ſhewes of garments, & al other traditions of his fathers, dunge and droſſe: ſo do theſe. So that thei haue one cō

But Bernard, thou knoweſt ſome thinge, what doeth belong to the Queenes Lieftenaunt, or Captaine of Barwicke, howe that he, for that ſame little Towne, muſt be watchful night and daye. He muſt haue an eye to the enemies, an eye to the walles, & both his eyes bent continuallie, vpon his ſouldioures, to finde all the meanes that he can poſſible, to keepe them in order, to haue them expert, euerie one in his trade, howe to handle his weapon, howe to ſaue him ſelfe, how to encounter with the enimie, and to be alwaies in readines. Therefore doth he oftentimes giue his charge, prouoketh with benefits, and with threatnings, and ſome times trieth by alarummes, who are the paynefull ſouldiers.

                  No, no. Thou art entered into a greater charge. Doe not all men in theyr Baptiſme promiſe to fight manfullie, like faithfull ſouldiours, vnder Chriſtes Standard? Doeſt not thou in the miniſtring of Baptiſme, as Chriſtes Liefetenaunt, and Captaine of his ſouldiers vnder thee, take their ſolemne vowe and promiſe to that purpoſe?

                  I graunt that I ſo do. But what then?

                  And art thou thus watchfull, and carefull, as thou haſt ſeene thy Captayne there?
               
               
                  Bern.
                  Nay, I neede not, we dwell not ſo neare the Scottes.

                  But Paule ſayeth, That ye Chriſtian man, hath a greater fight, than with fleſhe and bloude, euen with the Principalities and powers, the worldlie gouernors, the princes of the darkenes, of this worlde, which are aboue vs in the ayre. Therefore we muſt take againſt them all the armour

Nor knowe thyne enemies, when thou and all thyne, are in their handes incloſed? There is not one Legion, but whole armies of Deuils, deuouring this Towne, where thou haſte charge, by ignoraunce, ſuperſtition, Idolatrie, blaſphemie, contempte of Goddes worde, his Sacraments, his Sabbaothes, giuen to Drunkeneſſe, riott, diſſolutenes, pride, couetouſnes, adulterie, and infinite crimes. So that they fight vppon the Deuilles parte, againſte Chriſte: and yet thou their Captaine, canſt not eſpie it: or will not, by the ſword of the ſpirit (which is the worde of God) fight againſte this enemie, ye thus doth inuade thy cure: but the blinde leading the blinde, both periſhe togeather.

                  O, nowe I do ſome thing vnderſtande thy meaning, and I woulde fayne

                  I require nothing, but that Chriſt, whiche hath ſo dearelie bought the ſoules, with his owne bloud requireth, and that which God the Father requireth in the old and newe Teſtament, and the Primitiue Church did continuallie practiſe, vntil that blinde time, that the Maſſing prieſtes did creepe in, vnder the Romane Antichriſte. And yet in Gregories time, whē there was great blindneſſe, he him ſelfe can ſaye, that he is a dead Prieſt, (& therefore no prieſt, no more than a dead man is a man) whiche doeth not preache. For hee kindleth the wrath of the great Iudge agaynſte him, if he walke without the ſounde of preaching: Furthermore he ſayeth, That you prieſtes increaſe your owne ſinnes, with the death of others, and that you kill, and murther ſo manie, as you ſee dailie, without al care, holding your peace, go toward their death. Loe, here is other geare to be vrged, than ſurpleſſe matters. It is not inough to be a prieſt of cloutes, or a dumbe dogge that cā
                     not barke.
               
               
                  
                  Bern.
                  But yet I do aſke thee, howe it can be poſſible, to get ſo many preachers?
               
               
                  Mil.
                  No doubte, this popiſhe ware (as thou ſeeſt) doth driue out manie preachers, and ſtoppeth manie good menne (that I knowe) from comming to the miniſterie. Therefore one readie waye to gette moe Preachers, were to take it awaye: otherwiſe there may be founde manie, if GOD giue grace to ſeeke them. But as thou demaundeſt of me, Howe is it poſſible, to get ſo manie preachers, for this Ylelande: ſo might Titus haue demaunded of Paule, in the firſte planting of Chriſtian Religion, where he ſhould haue founde, ſo many preachers, and of ſo good qualities, in the Ylelande of Creta, as Paule appoynteth. But Paule and Titus both depended vpon Gods prouidence, knowing that God is riche ynough, to furniſhe his owne houſe and familie, and the ſpouſe of his Sonne Chriſte (which is the Churche) if it be not, thorow mans negligence. Therefore doeth Paule giue no leaue, nor Titus demaunde anie leaue, to place dumbe dogges, ſuch as were not apte to teache: much leſſe coulde they haue thought it meete, to place wolues in

the ſteede of ſheepeheardes. No, Paule vrgeth this pointe vnto Timothie, charging him before God and the Lorde Ieſus Chriſte, and his electe Angelles, not to lay handes vnaduiſedlie of anie, to be partaker of other mens ſinnes: as thoſe Biſhops nowe do which admitte a ſorte of popiſhe Aſſes, which were wonte to ſaye Maſſes, and ſuch others, as neither haue knoweledge, nor feare of God: which will weare anie thinge, or doe anie thinge, for an idle liuinge.

                  I hearde my Lorde Biſhop ſay, that they are fayne ſo to doe, or elſe they ſhould not haue Prieſtes inough, for the Countries. For yet one doeth ſerue two or three churches.
               
               
                  Mil.
                  That is a madde ſeruice, to ſerue two or three maiſters, for the gayne of proling proctors. And I thinke the pariſhes, would not be contente, with ſuche a ſwineheard.
               
               
                  Bern.
                  What then? ſhall they call forth Coblers and Taylours, that euerie pariſhe may haue one, & ſo place in men of handiecraftes, and occupations?
               
               
                  Mil.
                  Yea a great deale better were it ſo

to doe, than to place popiſhe Prieſtes, the deuourers of Chriſtes Lambes. For theyr prieſt crafte, was the wickedeſt occupation, that euer was in the worlde, and the moſte craftie. And as Celeſtine ſayeth truelie: It is no maruayle, thoughe thoſe that growe not vppe in the Churche, but haue crepte in at the backe doore, bringe ſtraunge geare, into the Churche, whiche they had in their other trade. For by theſe Popiſhe prieſtes (whiche neuer were of Chriſtes Churche) commeth in this popiſh traſhe.
                  But thou mayeſt perceyue by this, that I haue ſayde before, that I woulde haue none admitted, to this holie State, but ſuche, as are well inſtructed, in Chriſt Ieſus alreadie: And the Lorde our GOD, without them and their traſhe, can furniſh his Churche, (whiche is his owne houſe and familie) if wee coulde turne to him vnfeignedlie, by Godlie prayer: as oure Sauiour Chriſte teacheth: That we ſhould praye the Lorde of the Vyneyearde, to thruſt forth labourers, into his Vineyeard. Whiche hee graunte of his great mercies, and turne their hartes, or ſtaye theyr enterpriſes,

that ſtriue agaynſt Gods buſineſſe, eyther of malice, or of ignoraunce, AMEN. AMEN.
                  
                  But nowe (fellowe Bernarde) that thou mayeſt know, that the London Miniſters, and other their Brethren in the Countrie, haue iuſte cauſe, to ſpeake and preache as they doe, againſte the Popiſhe traſhe, that yet remayneth, here mayeſt thou reade in this Table following, moe than an hundred poyntes of Poperie, vnreformed in Englande. So that poperie (hauinge yet ſo manie ſprowtes and braunches amongſt vs) will ſurelie ſpreade agayne, if theſe and ſuch like faythefull Miniſters, bee put to ſilence.
                  They were godlie men (and are ſo coū
                     ted nowe after their deathe) that heawed downe, the great trees of Poperie. And ſhall theſe bee iudged euill men, that would digge vp the rootes and ſprowtes of Poperie, to cauſe it neuer to growe agayne, if it be poſſible? It is not onelie for the Cappe & the Surpleſſe that they contend, but agaynſte all theſe poyntes of Poperie, wherevnto they are vrged, to ſubſcribe, by

generall tearmes. So that the Goſpell ſhoulde bee tyed, by their Subſcriptions, to ſpreade no further, neyther for the reformation of the Miniſterie, nor for the recouering of true Diſcipline, nor for the aboliſhing of ſuch wicked ſuperſtitions, as theſe be which do followe.

                  Peace, here be to many. But mee thincke Miles, that there be ſome pointes here reckoned, that are ſmallie to be accoū
                     ted of, and are but verie trifles.
               
               
                  Mil.
                  That is true, for all poperie is but trifles. But what hath Chriſtes Church to

do, wt the poyſonfull leauē of popiſh trifles? Chriſt wt Antichriſt? A litle leauen corrupteth ye whole lūpe. A litle poyſon, ye whole pottage. And manie ſmall make a great heape. And how can we accounte it a good reformation, where ſo many pointes of poperie do remaine? Or why ſhoulde men in payne of priſonment, or loſſe of liuing, bee bounde to ſubſcribe and allowe all theſe pointes of poperie? But becauſe thou and thy fellowes ſhould not quarell, aboute the ſmaleſt trifles, I do giue thee ſeuen ſcore to the hundred. And wherfore is the glorious glaſſe of the Goſpell, by Gods mercie ſet before our eyes? but that we ſhoulde wipe away, all theſe popiſh blemiſhes, from the face of our Engliſh Churche, in the which we do boaſt of a reformation. God for his mercie graūt, that we may once ſee a right reformation in this church, to the glorie of his name here in Englād, AMEN.

               All theſe Popes were Antichriſtes one after another, and there are none of theſe Ceremonies and Monumentes of Idolatrie, but came all from theſe Antichriſtes, beſides the Lordlie gouernement of Biſhoppes, Popiſhe Excommunications and Abſolutions, Pluralities, Trialities, Tot quots, with ſuch other Diſpenſations and Licenſes, Inſtitutions, Inductions, Proxies, and Senages, &c. Theſe all fill the purſe, and were deuiſed of Antichriſte, to holde vp his kingdom. All theſe do the Tradicioners ſtill mainteyne, directlie agaynſte the commaundementes, whiche Samuell (as before is ſaide) doeth affirme, to bee wickedneſſe and Idolatrie.
               The true Diſcipline, by Gods word, without

the whiche, no true Religion can be, and which true reformed Churches doe holde and mainteyne, haue the Traditioners vtterly excluded. And therefore they can not truelie affirme and ſaye, That they doe deteſte all Antichriſtian Idolatrie: neyther yet that they conſent in all pointes of true doctrine, with all godlie reformed churches, whē theſe miſchiefes are mainteined, & true diſcipline baniſhed, which of neceſſitie muſt be ioyned.

enemies of thy Goſpell / & of this realme of Englād. Diſcloſe their miſchiefes and ſubtill practiſes: confounde their deuices: let them be takē in their own wylineſſes: and ſtrēgthen all thoſe that maintayne the cauſe and quarell of thy Goſpell / with inuincible force and power of thi holie Spirite: ſo that / though they bee deſtitute at anie tyme of worldlie ayde and comforte: that yet they fayle not to proceede and goe forward towardes that true godlineſſe

commaunded in thy holie worde / with all ſimplicitie and ſinceritie: to thy honor and glorie / the comforte of thine electe / and the cōfuſion of thine enemies / through Chriſt our Lorde and Sauiour. Amen. Amen. And ſay from the harte / AMEN.
               
               FINIS.
