            After W. E. moralized.
            
               THe God of loue, that ſits aboue,
               Doth know vs, Doth know vs,
               How ſinfull that we bee:
               Sent his word, the two edged ſword
               To ſhew vs, To ſhew vs,
               Our ſin and iniquitie.
               That euery vice may vanquiſhed be,
               Oh Lord ariſe for thy mercye
               Doe this our God and bynd vs,
               For euer and euer thine owne:
               The truth wyl alway fynd vs,
               By the ſeedes that we haue ſowne.
               The truth wyl tel if we wold lye,
               The touchſtone doth y• tree wel trye.
            
            
               ¶ And as we haue a ſoule to ſaue,
               Vprightly, Vprightly,
               Though troubled ſtil with ſin:
               We ſhuld not take, that did vs make,
               So lightly, So lightly,
               This worldly wealth to win.
               But if we wyl the Lord prouoke
               We may loke for his heauy ſtroke,
               As his word hath appointed
               The Scripture doth plainely tell:
               Yet ſhal not his holy anointed
               Once taſt the paynes of Hell.
               Now haue I told the 
                     •
                  eoperdy,
               But Chriſt is our iuſt remedy.
            
            
               ¶ With woful harts though god forbeares
               To plague vs, To plague vs,
               We ought for to lament:
               Thy word alway, both night & day
               Perſwade vs, Perſwade vs,
               Inwardly for to repent.
               And euery one to call for grace
               Since the touchſtone in euery place,
               Doth floriſh freſh and ſhyne
               That the whole world may ſee:
               And all that wyl be thyne,
               Muſt come with teares to thee.
               We wyl not boaſt our merites Lord,
               Since thy deare ſon made the accord
            
            
               ¶ We reade of olde, what Prophetes tolde
               full truly, Full truly,
               And wrote it long a

                  go:
               A Mayden myld, ſhulde beare a child
               Full duely, Full duely,
               And it proued euen ſo.
               But yet God wot, the Iewes of kynd
               Beleued it not, but were ſtyl blynd,
               And are vnto this day
               Refuſyng the Triumphant truth:
               That the Prophet Eſaye did ſay
               And wrote it to age and youth.
               But therto they wold not accord,
               But cruelly crucified the Lord.
            
            
               But let vs now, both bend and bow,
               And ſpede vs, And ſpede vs,
               To follow the true trace:
               For he hath ſent, his Teſtament,
               To feede vs. To feede vs,
               And call vs vnto grace.
               Vn worthy now although we bee
               Yet ye ſee how his deare mercye,

               And our le wde liues amend.
               Therfore let vs our harts enclyne,
               That pearles be not caſt vnto ſwyne

               Thus ſayeth our ſauiour Ieſu
               Come vnto me, and I wyl eaſe you▪

               Then wyl I open the locke
               And be ready to let you in.
               For I am he that bought you deare,
               Therfore behold, and draw ye neare.
