            A Dialogue betweene Warre, Famine, and the Pestilence, blazing their seuerall Euills.
            
            
               The Genius of VVarre.
               FAmine and Pestilence, Cowards of Hell,
               That strike in peace, when the whole worlds vnarmde:
               Tripping vp soules of Beggars, limblesse wretches,
               Hole-stopping Prisoners, miserable Catchpoles,
               Whom one vocation stabs, dare you Furies
               Confront the Ghost of crimson passing Warre?
               Thou bleake-cheekt wretch, one of my plenteous wounds
               Would make thée a good colour.
            
            
               Famine.
               I Defye,
               Thy blood and thée, tis that which I destroy,
               Ile starue thée Warre for this.
            
            
               VVarre.
               ALasse weake Famine;
               Why, a Taylor is the saridest man thou killt
               That liues by bread, thou darst not touch a Farmer,
               
                  
No nor his griping Sonne in Lawe that weds
               His daughter with a dowry of stuft Barnes,
               Thou runst away from these, such makes thée flye,
               And there thou lightst vpon the Labourers mawe,
               Breakst into poore mens stomackes, and there driuct
               The sting of Hunger like a Dastard.
            
            
               Famine.
               BAstard,
               Peace Warre, least I betray thy monstrous births
               Thou knowest I can deriue thee.
            
            
               Pestilence.
               And I both.
            
            
               VVarre.
               ANd I repugne you both, you hags of Realmes,
               Thou Witch of Famine, and Drab of plagues:
               Thou that makest men eate slouenly, and seede
               On excrements of Beasts, and at one meale
               Swallow a hundred pound in very Doues-dung.
            
            
               Famine.
               Therein thou tellst my glory and rich power.
            
            
               VVarre.
               And thou.
            
            
               
               Pestilence.
               BEware Warre how thou speakest of me,
               I haue friends here in England, though some dead
               Some still can showe, where I was borne and bred;
               Therefore be wary in pronouncing mée:
               Many haue tooke my part, whose Carcases
               Lye now tenne sadome deepe: many aliue
               Can showe their skars in my contagious Duarrell:
               Warre, I surpasse the furie of thy stroake,
               Say that an Army fortie thousand strong,
               Enter thy crimson lists, and of that number,
               Perchance the fourth part falls, markt with red death?
               Why, I stay fortie thousand in one Battaile,
               Full of blew wounds, whose cold clay Bodies looke
               Like speckled Marble.
               As for lame persons, and maimed Souldiers
               There I outstrip thée too; how many Swarmes
               Of bruised and crackt people did I leaue,
               Their Groines sore pier'st with pestilentiall Shot:
               Their Arme-pits digd with Blaines, and vlcerous Sores,
               Lurking like poysoned Bullets in their flesh?
               Othersome shot in the eye with Carbuncles,
               Their Lies as monstrous as the Sarazens.
            
            
               Warre.
               THou plaguy woman, cease thy infectious brags,
               Thou pestilent strumpet, base and common murdress, e
               
                  
What men of marke or memory haue fell
               In they poore purple Battaile, say thou'st slayne
               Foure hundred Silkweauers, poore Silk-wormes, vanisht
               As many Tapsters, Chamberlaines, and Ostlers,
               Darest thou contend with me thou freckled-Harlet,
               And match thy durty Glories, with the Splendor
               Of Kingly Tragedies acted by me?
               When I haue dyed the greene stage of the field,
               Red with the blood of Monarchs, and rich states,
               How many Dukes and Earles, haue I drunke by
               At one couragious Rows? O Summer Diuell,
               Thou wast but made as Rats bane to kill Bawds,
               To poyson Drunkards, vomiting out their Soules
               Into the Bulke of Hell, to infect the Corps
               Of Pewter-buttonde Serieants, such as these
               Uenome whole Realmes: and as Phisitians say,
               Poysons with poyson, must be forest away.
            
            
               Pestilence.
               WArre, twit not me with double damned Bawdes,
               Or prostituted Harlots, I leaue them
               For my French Nephewe, he raignes ouer these:
               Ile show you both how I excell you both.
               Who euer read that Usurers dyed in Warre
               Grasping a Sword, or in an yron yeare,
               Languisht with Famine? but by me surprizde
               Euen in their Counting houses, as they sate
               Amongst their golden Hills: when I haue changed
               Their Gold into dead tokens, with the touch
               Of my pale-spotted, and infectious Rodde,
               When with a suddaine start and gastly looke,
               
                  
They haue left counting Coyne, to count their flesh,
               And summe vp their last vsury on their Brests,
               All their whole wealth, lockt in their bony Chests.
            
            
               VVarre.
               ARe Usurers then the proudest Acts thou playdst?
               Pack-Penny fathers, Couetous rooting Moles,
               That haue their gold thrice higher then their soules:
               Is this the Top of all thy glorious Laughters,
               To ayme them at my princely Massacres?
               Poore Dame of Pestilence, and Hag of Famine,
               I pittie your weake furies.
            
            
               Famine.
               OH I could eate you both,
               I am so torne with Hunger, and with Rage:
               What is not flinty Famine, gasping Dearth,
               Worthy to be in ranke weth dusty Warre?
               And little Pestilence, are not my Acts
               More stony-pittilesse then thine, or thine?
               What ist to dye stampt full of drunken wounds,
               Which makes a man réele quickly to his Graue,
               Without the sting of Torments, or the sence
               Of chawing Death by peecemeale? vndons and done,
               In the forth part of a poore short Minute?
               Tis but a bloody flumber, a read dreame,
               Not worthy to be named a torturing Death,
               Nor thine thou most infectieus Citty name,
               That for thy Pride art plagued, bearst the shape
               Of running Pestilence, those which thou strikest
               
                  
Were death within fewe dayes vpon their hearts,
               Or else presage amendment: when I raigne,
               Heauen puts on a bresse, to be as hard in blessing,
               As the earth fruitlesse in increasing. Oh,
               I rack the vatnes and Sinewes, lancks the lungs,
               Fréeze all the passages, plough vp the Mawe:
               My torment lingers like a sute in Lawe,
               What are you both to me insolent Euills?
               Ioyne both your furies, they waigh light to mine.
               And what art thou Warre, that so wantest thy good?
               But like a Barber-Surgion that lets blood.
            
            
               Warre.
               Out Lenten Harlot.
            
            
               Pestilence.
               Out on you both, and if all matter failes,
               Ile showe my glorie in these following Tales.

                  WHat Signior Ginglespur, the first Gallant I mette in Powles, since the one and thirtie daie, or the decease of Iuly, and I may fitly call it the decease, for there deceast aboue three hundred that daye, a shrewde Prologue marry to the Tragedie that followed: and yet I speake somewhat improperly to call it a Prologue, because those that tied were all out of their Partes; What dare you venture Sig. at the latter ende of a Fraye now? I meane not at a Fraye with swordes and Bucklers, but with sores & Carbunckles: I protest you are a strong Mettalde Gentle-man, because you do not feare the dangerous Featherbeds of London, nor to be tost in a perilous Blancket, or to lie in the fellowes of those sheetes that two dead Bodies were wrapt in some thrée monethes before. Naye I can tell you, there is many an

honest house in London wel stockt before with large linneu, where now remaines not aboue two shéetes & a halfe,

But soft Signior, what may he be that stalkt by vs now in a ruinous sute of apparell, with his Page out at Elbowes: tis a strange sight in Powles Signior, mée thinkes, to see a broken Page follow a seamerent Maister.
            
            
               Sig. Ginglespurre.

               Sig. Kickshow.
               A very excellent Folly, that the name of the Plague should take the wall of a Coach, and driue his Worship downe into the Chanell.
               But sée how we haue lost our selues, Powles is changde into Gallants, and those which I saw come vp in old

Taffala Doublets yesterday, are slipt into nine yardes of Sattin to day.

               And Signiors, wée in especiall care haue sent our Pages to enquire out a payre of honest cleane Taylors, which are hard to be found, because there was such a number of Botchers the last Sommer: and I thinke it one of Hercules Labours, to finde two whole Taylors about London, that hath not béene Plagued for their stealing, or else for sowing of false séeds, which péepe out before their Seasons.

               But what, dare you venture to an Ordinarie: harke, the Quarter-Iarkes are vp for a Leauen; I know an honest Host about London, that hath barreld vp newes for Gallants, like Pickled Oysters, marry your Ordinarie will cost you two shillings, but the Tales that lie in Brine will be worth sixpence of the money: for you know tis great charges to keepe Tales long, and therefore he must be somewhat considered for the laying out of his Language: for blinde Gue you know has six

the Bell was towling, cried, lowder yet; I heare thée not Maister Bell: then strutting vp and downe the chamber, spake to the Audience in this wise.
               Ist possible a man should walke in such perfect memory and haue the Bell towle for him? sure I neuer heard of any that did the like before mée.
               Thus by towling of the great Bell, all the Parish rang of him, diuerse opinions went of him, and not without cause or matter to worke vpon: In conclusion, within fewe dayes after, he was found to be the man indéed, whose part he did but play before; his Pulses were angry with him, and began to beate him; all his Pores fell out with him; the Bel towld for him in sadnes, rung out in gladnes, and there was the end of his drunken madnes; such a ridiculour humour of dying was neuer heard of before: and I hope neuer shall be againe, now he is out of England.

               Of one that fell drunke off from his Horse, taken for a Londoner, dead.
               
                  IN a certaine country-towne not farre of, there was a boone companion lighted amongst good fellowes, as they call good fellowes now a dayes, which are those that can drinke best, for your excellent drunkard, is your notable Gallant, and he that can passe away cleare without paying the Host in the Chimney-Corner, he is the king of Cannes, and the Emperour of Alehouses, this fellow tying his Horse by the Bridle vpon the red Lattis of the window, could not bridle himselfe so well, but afterward proued more Beast then his Horse, being so ouerwhelmed with whole Cans, hoopes, and such drunken deuices, that his English Crowne weighed lighter by ten graines at his comming forth, then at his entering in: and it was easier now for his Horse to get vp a Top of Powles, then he to get vp vpon his Horse, the stirrup plaide mock-holy-day with him, and made a foole of his foote: at last with much adoe he fell flounce into the Saddle, and away he scudded out at townes end, where he thought euery Tree he saw had bene rising vp to stop him: so strangly are the sences of drunkards tost and transported, that at the very instant, they thinke the worlds drownd againe; so this staggering Monster imagined he was riding vppon a Sea-mare: but before he was Tenne Gallops from the towne-side, his briane plaide him a Iades trick, and kickt him ouer, downe he fell. When the Horse sóberer then the maister stood still and wonderd at him for a Beast; but durst not say so much; by and by Passingers passing too and fro, beholding his lamentable downefall, cald

within: to conclude, these long deuices were brought to remoue him without a writ; when by meere chaunce past by one of the wisest of the towne next the Constable, for so it appeared afterwards, by the hornes of his deuice, who being certifesd of the storie, and what they went about to doe, brake into these words openly.

                  Whereof one especially, notable and politicke may euen leade you to the rest and driue you into Imagination of many the like: for one to burie foure or fiue persons out of his house, and yet neither the Sexton of the same Parish, nor any else of his Neighbours in the stréete where hee dwelles in to haue intelligence of it, (but

                  Many other maruelious euents happened, both in the Citty, & else where. As for example, In dead mans place at Saint Mary-ouerus; a man seruant bring buried at seuen of the clocke in the morning, and the graue standing open for more dead Commodities, at foure of the clocke in the same euening, he was got vp aliue againe by strange miracle: which to be true and certaine, hundreds of people can

But let not this make you sad, Gallants: sit you merry stil: Here my dainty Bullyes, Ile put you all in one Goblet, and wash all these Tales in a Cup of Sack.
