            A PRINCELY SONG made of the Red Rose and the White, royally vnited to
               gether by king Henry the seauenth, and Elizabeth Plantaginet, daughter to Edward the fourth, from whom our now Soueraigne Lord King Iames linnially descended.
            
            To the tune of when Flying fame.
            
               WHen Yorke and Lankaster made war,
               within this famous land:
               The liues of Englands royall péeres,
               did in much danger stand.
               Seauen English Kings in bloody feelds,
               for Englands crowne did fight:
               In which their heires were all but twaine,
               of liues bereaued quight.
            
            
               
               Then thirty thousand Englishmen,
               were in one battle slaine:
               Yet could not all this English blood,
               a setled peace obtaine.
               For fathers kind their déere sonnes killd,
               and sonnes their fathers slew:
               Yea kindreds fought against their kind.
               and not each others knew.
            
            
               At last by Henries lawfull claime,
               this wasting warre had end:
               For Englands peace he soone restord,
               and did the same defend.
               For Tyrant Richard, namd the third,
               chiefe bréeder of this woe:
               By him, was slaine neare Leaster towne,
               as cronicles doc show.
            
            
               All feares of warre he thus exild,
               which ioyd each Englishman:
               And daies of long desired peace,
               within the land began.
               He ruld his Kingdome by true loue,
               to theire his subiects liues:
               For euery one had dayly ioy,
               and comfort of their wines.
            
            
               
               King Henry had such princely care,
               our further peace to frame:
               Tooke faire Elizabeth to wife,
               that gallant Yorkest dame.
               Fourth Edwards daughter (blest of God)
               to scape King Richards spight:
               Was thus made Englands peareles Quéene,
               and Henries hearts delight.
            
            
               Thus Henry first of Tudors name,
               and last of Lankaster:
               With Yorkes right heire, a true-loues knot,
               did linke and tie full fast.
               Renowned Yorke the White Rose gaue,
               braue Lankaster the Red,
               By wedlocke here conioynd to grow,
               both in one princely bed.
            
            
               These Roses sprang and budded faire,
               and carried such a grace:
               That Kings of England in their armes,
               affords them worthy place.
               And florish may these Roses long,
               that all the world may tell,
               The owner of these princely flowers,
               in vertues doe excell.
            
            
               
               To glorifie these Roses more,
               King Henry and his Quéene:
               First plac'd their pictures in red gold,
               most gorgrous so be séene.
               The Kings owne gard, now weares the same,
               vpon their backes and brest:
               Where loue and loyalty remaines,
               and euer-more shall rest.
            
            
               The Red Rose on the backe is plast,
               thereon a crowne of gold:
               The White Rose on the brest as braue,
               and costly to behold.
               Bedeckt most rich with siluer stues,
               on cotes of Scarlet red:
               A blushing hew, (which Englands same)
               now many a yeare hath bred.
            
            
               Thus Tudor and Plantaginet,
               
               these honors first deuized:
               To well-come long desired peace,
               with vs so dearely prized.
               A peace that now maintayned is,
               by Iames our royall King:
               For peacobrings plenty to the land,
               with euery blessed thing.
            
            
               
               To speake againe of Henries praise,
               his Princely liberall hand:
               Gaue guifts and graces many waies,
               vnto this famous land.
               For which the Lord him blessings sent,
               and multiplied his store,
               In that he left more wealth to vs,
               then any any King before.
            
            
               For first his swéet and louely Quéene,
               a ioy aboue the rest:
               Brought him both sonnes and daughters faire
               to make this kingdome blest.
               The royall blood that was at ebb,
               so increased by this Quéene:
               That Englands heires vnto this day,
               doe florish faire and gréene.
            
            
               The first faire blessing of his séede
               was Arthur prince of Wales:
               Whose vertues to the Spanish court,
               quite ore the Ocean sayles.
               There Ferdinand, the King of Spaine,
               his daughter Katherne gaue:
               For wife vnto the English Prince,
               a thing that God would haue.
            
            
               
               Yet Arthur in his lofty youth,
               and blooming time of age:
               Submitted méekely his swéet life,
               to deaths impartiall rage.
               Who dying so, no issew left,
               the swéet of natures ioy:
               Which compast England round with grief
                     •
                  
               
               and Spaine with sad anoy.
            
            
               King Henries second comfort prou'd,
               a Henry of his name:
               In following time eight Henry cald,
               a King of noble fame.
               He conquered Bullen by his sword,
               With many townes in France:
               His manly might, and fortitude,
               did Englands fame aduance.
            
            
               He Popish Abbies first supprest,
               and Papestry puld downe:
               And bound their lands by parliment,
               vnto his royall crowne.
               He had thrée children by thrée wiues,
               all Princes raining here:
               
                  Edward, Mary, and Elizabeth:
               
               a Quéene belou'd most deare.
            
            
               
               These thrée swéet branches bare no frute,
               God no such ioy did send:
               Through which the Kingly Tudors name,
               in England here had end.
               The last Plantaginet that liu'd,
               was nam'd Elizabeth:
               
               
                  Elisabeth last Tudor was,
               the greatest Quéene of earth.
            
            
               Seuenth Henry yet we name againe,
               Whose grace gaue frée consent:
               To haue his daughters married both,
               to Kings of high dessent.
               
                  Margret the eldest of the twaine,
               Was made great Scotlands Quéene,
               As wise, as faire, as vertuous,
               as eare was Lady séene.
            
            
               From which faire Quéene (our royall King)
               by lineall course descendeth:
               And rightfully inioyes that crowne,
               Which God now still befrendeth.
               For Tudor and Plantaginet,
               
               by yéelding vnto death:
               Hath made renowned Stewards name,
               the greatest vpon earth.
            
            
               
               His younger daughter Mary calld,
               as Princely by degrée:
               Was by her father worthy thought,
               the Quéene of France to be.
               And after to the Suffolke Duke,
               was made a noble wise:
               Where-in the famous English court,
               she lead a vertuous life.
            
            
               King Henry and his louely Quéene,
               reioyst to sée the day:
               To haue their children thus aduanst,
               with honors euery way.
               Which purchast pleasure and content,
               with many a yeares delight:
               Till sad mischance by cruell death,
               procur'd them both a spight.
            
            
               The Quéene that faire and princely damo,
               that mother méeke and mild:
               To ad more number to her ioyes,
               againe grew big with child.
               All which brought comfort to her King,
               against which carefull hower:
               He lodgd his deare kind-hearted Quéene,
               in Londons stately Tower.
            
            
               
               That Tower which prou'd so fatal once,
               to Princes of degrée:
               Prou'd fatall to this noble Quéene,
               for therein died she.
               In child-bed lost she her swéet life:
               her life estéemed so deare,
               Which had béene Englands louing Quéene,
               full many a happy yeare.
            
            
               The King herewith pocest with griefe,
               spent many months in moane:
               And dayly sight and said that he,
               like her could find out none.
               Nor none could he in fancy chuse,
               to make his wedrd wise:
               Therefore a widdower would remaine,
               the remnant of his life.
            
            
               His after daies be spent in peace,
               and quietnesse of mind:
               Like King and Quéene, as these two were,
               the world can hardly find.
               Our King and Queene, yet like to them,
               in vertue and true loue:
               Haue heauenly blessings in like sort,
               from heauenly powers aboue.
            
         
         
            
            A delightfull song, of the foure famous feasts of England, the one of them ordayned by King Henry the seuenth, of the honor of Marchant Taylers, shewing how seauen Kings haue bin free of that company, and now 
                  ••
               stly graced with the loue of our renowned Prince Henry of great Brittaine.
            To the tune of Treatans toy.
            
               ENgland is a Kingdome,
               of all the world admired:
               More statclinesse in pleasures,
               can no way be desired.
               The court is full of brauery,
               the citty stor'd with wealth,
               The law preserueth vnity,
               the country kéepeth health.
            
            
               Yet no like pompe and glory,
               our cronicles record:
               As foure great feasts of England,
               do orderly afford.
               All others be but dinners calld,
               or banquete of good sort:
               And none but sowre be named feasts,
               which here I will report.
            
            
               
               Saint Georges feast, the first of all,
               maintained is by Kings:
               Where much renowne and royalty,
               thereof now dayly rings.
               Princes come from forraine lands,
               to be Saint Georges Knights:
               The goulden garter thus is worne,
               by sundry worthy wights.
            
            
               Saint George our English champion,
               in most delightfull sort:
               Is celebrated yeare by yeare,
               in Englands royall court.
               The King with all his noble traine,

               Still glorisies the festiuall,
               of great Saint Georges day.
            
            
               The honored Maior of London,
               the second feast ordaines:
               By which the worthy cittizens,
               much commendation gaines.
               For Lords and Iudges of the land,
               and Knights of good request:
               To Guild hall comes to countenance,

               another feast asords:
               With grace and honor glorified,
               by Englands Noble Lords.
               And this we call the Sargiant feast,
               a third in name and place:
               But yet there is a fourth like wise,
               deserues as gallant grace.
            
            
               The Marchant Taylors company,
               that fellowship of fame:
               To Londons lasting dignity,

               the fairest and the best:
               The Kings large forrests can afford,

               Then let all London companies,
               so highly in renowne:
               Giue Marchant taylors name and same,
               to weare the lawrell crowne,
               For seuen of Englands royall Kings,
               thereof haue all béene frée:
               And with their loues and fauors grac'd,
               this worthy company.
            
            
               King Richard once the second nam'd,
               vnhappy in his fall:
               Of all these race of royall Kings,
               was frée-man first of all.
               
                  Bullinbrooke, fourth Henry next,
               by order him succéeds,
               To gloryfie this brotherhood
               by many Princely déeds,
            
            
               Fift Henry which so valiently,
               deserued fame in France,
               Became free of this company,
               faire London to aduance,
               Sixt Henry then the next in raigne,
               though lucklesse in his daies,
               Of Marchant-taylors free-man was,
               to his eternall praise.
            
            
               
               Fourth Edward that right worthy King,
               beloued of great and small:
               Also performd a frée mans loue,
               to this renowned Hall.
               Third Richard which by cruellty,
               brought England many woes:
               Unto this worthy company,
               no little fauour showes.
            
            
               But richest fauours yet at last,
               procéeded from a King:
               Whose wisdome round about the world,
               in Princes eares doth ring,
               King Henry whome we call the seuenth;
               made them the greatest gracd:
               Because in marchant Taylors Hall,
               his picture now stands placed.
            
            
               Their charter was his Princely guift,
               maintaynd unto this day:
               He added Marchant to the name,
               of Taylors as some say.
               So Martchant Taylors they be cal'd,
               his royall loue was so:
               No London company the like,
               estate of Kings can shoe.
            
            
               
               From time, to time, we thus behold,
               the Marchant-Taylers glory:
               Of whose renowne the Muses pens,
               may make a lasting story.
               This loue of Kings begot such loue,
               of our now royall Prince:
               For greater loue then his to them,
               was nere before nor since.
            
            
               It pleased so his Princely minde,
               in méeke kinde curtesie:
               To be a friendly frée-man made,
               of this braue company:
               London then in heart reioyce,
               and Marchant Taylers sing
               Forth prayses of this gentle Prince,
               the sonne of our good King.
            
            
               To tell the welcomes to the world,
               he then in London had:
               Might sill vs full of pleasing ioyes,
               and make our hearts full glad.
               His triumphs there performd and done,
               long lasting will remaine:
               And Chronicles report aright,
               the order of it plaine.
            
         
         
            
            The Lamentable song of the Lord Wigmoore gouernor of Warwicke Castle, and the fayre maid of Dunsmoore: as a warning to all maids to haue care how they yeeld to the wanton delights of young gallants.
            To the tune of Diana.
            
               In Warwicke-sheir there stands a downe,
               and Dunsmoore heath it hath to name:
               Adioyning to a country towne,
               made famous by a maidens name.
            
            
               Fairo Isabel she called was,
               a shepheards daughter as some say:
               To wigmoores eare her fame did passe,
               as he in Warwicke Casile lay.
            
            
               Poore loue-sicke Lord, immediatly,
               vpon her fame set his delight:
               And thought much pleasure sure did lie,
               possessing of so swéet a wight.
            
            
               
               Therfore to Dunsmore did repaire,
               to recreate his sickly mind:
               Where in a summers euening faire,
               his chance was Isabell to find.
            
            
               She sat amidst a medow greene,
               most richly spred with smelling flowers.
               And by a riuer she was seene,
               to spend away some euening howers.
            
            
               There sat this ma
                     •
                  den all alone,
               washing her selfe in secret wise,
               Which Uirgin faire to looke vppon,
               did much delight his longing eye
                     ••
                  
               
            
            
               She thinking not to be espied.
               had layd from her her Contrey tire,
               The tresses of her haire vntide,
               hung glistring like the golden wier,
            
            
               And as the slakes of winters snow,
               that lies vnmelted on the plaines.
               So white her body was in show,
               like siluer springs did run her vaines.
            
            
               
               He rauisht with this pleasing sight,
               Stood as a man amazed still:
               Suffring his eyes to take delight,
               That neuer thought they had their fill.
            
            
               She blinded his affection so,
               That reasons rules were led awry:
               And loue the coales of lust did blow,
               Which to a fire soone slamed hye.
            
            
               And though he knew the sinne was great,
               Yet burned so within his brest:
               With such a vehement scorching heat,
               That none but she could lend him rest.
            
            
               Lord Wigmoore thus beeing drownd in lust,
               By liking of this dainty Dame:
               He call'd a seruant of great trust,
               Inquiring straight what was her name.
            
            
               She is quoth he no married wife,
               But a Shepheards daughter as you sée:
               And with her father leads her life,
               Whose dwellings by these pastures bée.
            
            
               
               Her name is Isabel the saire,
               
               Then stay quoth he, and speake no more:
               But to my Castle straight her beare,
               Her sight hath wounded me full sore.
            
            
               Thus to Lord Wigmoore she was brought,
               Who with delight his fancies fed:
               And through his sute such means he wrought
               That he intic'd her to his bed.
            
            
               This beeing done incontinent,
               She did returne from whence she came,
               And euery day she did inuent,
               To couer her receiued shame.
            
            
               But ere three months were fully past,
               Her crime committed plaine appeares:
               Unto Lord Wigmoore then in hast,
               She long complain'd with weeping teares.
            
         
         
            The complaint of faire Isabell for the losse of her honor, at the end whereof shee slew her selfe.
            To the same tune.
            
               LOrd Wigmoore thus I haue defild,
               And spotted my pure Uirgins bed:
               
                  
Behold I am conceau'd with childe,
               To which vile folly you me led.
            
            
               for now this déed that I haue wrought,
               Throughout this country well is knowne,
               And to my wo
                     •
                  ull parents brought,
               Whom now for me do make great mone.
            
            
               How shall I looke them in the sace,
               When they my shamelesse selfe shall sée:
               Oh cu
                     •
                  sed Eue I séele thy case,
               When thou hadst tasted on the trée.
            
            
               Thou hidst thy selfe and so must I,
               But God thy trespasse quickly found:
               The darke may hide me from mans eye,
               But leaue my shame still to abound.
            
            
               Wide open are mine eyes to looke,
               Upon my séed and heauy sinne:
               And quite vnclasped is the booke,
               Where my accounts are written in.
            
            
               This sinne of mine deserueth death,
               Be Iudge Lord Wigmoore I am shée:
               For I haue tread a strumpets path,
               And for the same I néeds must dye.
            
            
               
               Bespotted with reproachfull shame,
               To ages following shall I bee:
               And in records be writ my blame,
               Lord Wigmoore this is long of thée.
            
            
               Lord Wigmoore prostrate at thy féete,
               I craue my iust deserued doome:
               That death may cut off from the roote,
               This body, blossom, branch and bloome.
            
            
               Let modesty accuse this crime,
               Let loue, and law, and nature speake:
               Was euer any wretch yet seene,
               That in one instant all did breake.
            
            
               Then Wigmoore Iustice on me shew,
               That thus consented to this act:
               Giue me my death, for death is due,
               To such as sinnes in such a fact.
            
            
               Oh that the wombe had beene my graue,
               Or I had perisht in my birth:
               Or that same day may darknesse haue,
               Wherein 
                     •
                   first drew vitall breath.
            
            
               
               Let God regard it not at all,
               Let not the sunne vpon it shine:
               Let misty darknesse on it fall,
               For to make knowne this sinne of mine.
            
            
               The night wherein I was conceau'd,
               Let be accurst with mournefull cryes:
               Let twinckling starres from skyes bereau'd,
               And clowds of darkenesse thereon rise.
            
            
               Because they shot not vp the powers,
               That gaue the passage to my life:
               Come sorrow finish vp mine howers,
               And let my time here end in griefe.
            
            
               And hauing made this wofull moane,
               A knife she snatched from her side.
               Where Lucresse part was rightly showne.
               For with the same fayre Isabell dyed.
            
            
               Hereat Lord Wigmoore greeued sore,
               In heart repenting his amisse:
               And after would attempt no more,
               To crop the flowers of Maidens blisse.
            
            
               But liued long in wofull wise,
               
                  
Till death did finish vp his dayes:
               And now in Isabels graue he lyes,
               Till iudgment comes-them both to raise.
            
         
         
            A Song of Sir Richard Whittington, who by strange fortunes, came to bee thrice Lord Maior of London, with his bountifull guifts and liberallity giuen to this honorable Citty.
            To the tune of dainty come thou to me.
            
               HEre must I tell the praise,
               of worthy Whittington:
               
               Knowne to be in his dayes,
               thrice Maior of London.
               But of poore parentage,
               borne was he as we heare:
               And in his tender age,
               bred vp in Lancashire.
            
            
               Poorely to London than,
               came vp this simple lad:
               Where with a Marchant man,
               soone he a dwelling had.
               And in a Kitchin plast,
               a scullion for to be.
            
            
               
               Wheras long time he past,
               in labour drudgingly.
            
            
               His daily seruice was,
               turning spitts at the fire:
               And to scoure pots of brasse,
               for a poore Scullions hire.
               Meat and drinke all his pay,
               of coyne he had no store:
               Therefore to run away,
               in secret thought he bore.
            
            
               So from this marchant man,
               
                  Whittington secretly:
               Towards his Contry ran,
               to purchase liberty.
               But as he went along,
               in a faire summer morne,
               London bells swéetly rung,
               
                  Whittington back returne.
            
            
               Euermore sounding so,
               turne againe Whittington:
               
               For thou in time shalt grow,
               Lord Maior of London.
               Wherevpon back againe,
               
                  VVhittington came with spéed:
               
                  
A prentise to remaine,

               Troubled with Rats and Mice,
               as they did vnderstand:
               The King of that Contry there,
               as he at dinner sat:
               Daily remain'd in feare,
               of many a Mouse and Rat.
            
            
               Meat that on trenchers lay,
               no way they could keepe safe:
               But by Rats borne away,
               fearing no wand nor staffe,
               Wherevpon soone they brought,
               
                  Whittingtons nimble Cat:
               Which by the King was bought,
               heapes of gold giuen for that.
            
            
               Home againe came these men,
               with their ship loaden so:
               
                  Whittingtons wealth began,
               by this cat thus to grow.

               to be a Marchant good:
               
                  
And soone began to looke,

            The life and death of the great Duke of Buckingham, who came to an vntimely end, for consenting to the deposing of the two gallant young princes, King Edward the fourths Children.
            To the tune of Shores wife.
            
               A Tale of griefe I must vnfold,
               a tale that neuer yet was told:
               A tale that might to pitty mooue,
               the spirits below and Saints aboue.
            
            
               When warres did plague this maiden land,
               great Buckingham in grace did stand:
               With Kings and Quéenes he ruled so,
               when he said I, none durst say no.

                   his owne:
               By Henry Staffords help obtaind
               what reason wild to be refraind.
            
            
               If any noble of this land,
               against great Glosters aime did stand:
               Ould Buckingham with might and power,
               in seas of woes did him deuoure.
            
            
               
               He hoped when Richard was made King,
               he would much greater honors bring:
               To Buckingham and to his name,
               and well reward him for the same.
            
            
               In Clarence death he had a hand,
               and gainst King Edwards Quéen did stand,
               And to hir sonnes bore little l

                  ue,
               when he as Bastards would them prooue.
            
            
               King Edward swore him by his oth,
               in true aledgeance to them both,
               Which if I faile I wish quoth he,
               all Christians curse may light on me.
            
            
               It so fell out on All Soules day,
               by law his life was tane away:
               He had his wish though not his will,
               for treasons end is alwaies ill.
            
            
               In London hauing pleaded claime,
               and Richard there by won  the game:
               He challengd honour for his gaine
               but was rewarded with disdaine.
            
            
               On which disgrace within few houres,
               
                  
Great Buckingham had raisd his powers,
               But all in vaine the King was strong,
               and Stafford néeds must suffer wrong.
            
            
               His Army faild and durst not stand,
               vpon a Traitors false command:
               Beeing thus deceaued onld Stafford fled,
               not knowing where to hide his head.
            
            
               The King with speed to haue him found,
               did offer ful two thousand pound:
               Thus Richard sought to cast him downe,
               whose wit did win him Englands Crowne,
            
            
               The plaine old Duke his life to saue,
               of his owne man did succour craue:
               In hope that he would him releiue,
               that late much land to him did giue.
            
            
               Base Banester this man was nam'd,
               by this vild déed for euer sham'd:
               It is quoth he a common thing,
               to iniure him that wrongd his King.
            
            
               King Edwards children he betraid,
               the like gainst him I will haue plaid.
               
                  
Being true, my heart him greatly graft,
               but prouing false that loue is past.
            
            
               Thus Banester his maister sold,
               vnto his foe, for hier of gold:
               But marke his end and rightly see,
               the iust reward of trechery.
            
            
               The Duke by law did loose his blood,
               for him he sought to doe most good:
               The man that wrought his Maisters woe,
               by lingring griefe was brought full low.
            
            
               For when the King did heare him speake,
               how basely he the Duke did take:
               Instead of gold gaue him disgrace,
               with vanishment from towne and place.
            
            
               Thus Banester was forst to beg,
               and craue for food with cap and leg:
               But none to him would bread bestow:
               that to his master proued a foe.
            
            
               Thus wandred he in poore estate:
               repenting his misdeed to late:
               
                  
Till starued he gaue vp his breath,
               by no man pittied at his death,
            
            
               To wofull ends his Children came,
               sore punisht for their fathers shame:▪
               
               Within a kennell one was drownd,
               where water scarse could hide the ground▪

               The Queen in trauell pained sore,
               full thirty wofull daies and more:
               And no way could deliuered be,
               as euery Lady wisht to see,
               Wherefore the King made greater mone,

               Beeing somthing eased in his mind,
               his eyes a slumbring sleepe did find:
               Where dreaming he had lost a rose,

                  Elizabeth raigned next to her,

               Wonder world, foor such a Quéene,

               A mayd, a Saint, an Angell bright,

            A short and sweet sonnet made by one of the maides of honor vpon the death of Queene Elizabeth, which she sowed vppon a sampler in red silke.
            To a new tune or to Phillida flouts me.
            
               GOne is Elizabeth,
               
               whom we haue lou'd so deare:
               
                  
She our kind Mistris was,
               full foure and forty yeare.
               England she gouernd well
               not to be blamed:
               Flanders sho succord still,
               and Ireland tamed.
               France she befrended,
               Spaine she hath soiled:
               Papists reiected,
               and the Pope spoyled.
               To Princes powerfull,
               to the world vertuous:
               To her foes mercifull,
               to subiects gracious.
               Her soule is in heauen,
               the world keepes her glory:
               Subiects her good deeds,
               and so ends my story,
            
         
         
            
            The life and death of famous Th. Stukely, an English gallant in the time of Queene Elizabeth, who ended his dayes in a battaile of Kings in Barbarie.
            To the tune of King Henries going to Bullin.
            
               IN the west of England,
               borne there was I vnderstand:
               A famous gallant liuing in his dayes.
               by birth a wealthy Clothiers sonne,
               Deeds of wonder he hath done,
               to purchase him a long and lasting praise.
            
            
               If I should tell his story,
               pride was all his glory:
               And lusty Stuekly he was cald in court.
               he serud a Bishop of the west,
               And did accompany the best
               maintaining still him selfe in galant sort.
            
            
               Being thus esteemed,
               and euery where well deemed:
               
                  
He gaind the fauour of a London dame:
               daughter to an Alderman,
               
                  Curtis he was called than,
               to whom a sutor gallantly he came.
            
            
               When she his person spied,
               he could not be denied
               So braue a Gentle man he was to see,
               she was quickly made his wife:
               In weale or woe to lead her life,
               her father willingly did so agree.
            
            
               Thus in state and pleasure,
               ful many daies they measure:
               Till cruell death with his regardles spight:
               bore old Curtis to his graue,
               A thing that Stukely wisht to haue,
               that he might reuell all in gold so bright.
            
            
               He was no sooner toombed,
               but Stukely presumed:
               To spend a hundred pound that day in wast:
               the brauest gallants of the land,
               Had Stukelies purse at their command,
               thus merily the time away he past.
            
            
               
               Tauerns and Ordinaries,
               were his cheefest braueries,
               Goulden angells flew there vp and downe:
               r
                     ••
                  ts were his best delight,
               With stately feastings day and night,
               in court and Citty thus he won renowne.
            
            
               Thus wasting land and liuing,
               by this his lawlesse giuing:
               At last he sould the pauements of his yard:
               which couered were with blocks of tin,
               Old Curtis left the same to him,
               which he consumed vainely as you heard.
            
            
               Where at his wife sore greeued,
               desird to be relceued,
               Make much of me deere husband she did say,
               Ile make much more of thee quoth he,
               then any one shall verily,
               Ile 
                     •
                  ell thy clothes, and so will go my way.
            
            
               Cruelly thus hearted,
               away from her he parted,
               And trauelled to Italy with speed,
               there he slorisht many a day
               In his silkes and rich aray:
               
                  
and did the pleasures of a Lady feed.
            
            
               It was this Ladies pleasure,
               to giue him gold and treasure,
               And to maintaine him in great pomp and faine
               at last came newes assuredly.
               Of a batlaile fought in Barbary,
               and he would valiantly go see the same.
            
            
               Many a noble gallant,
               sould both land and tallant:
               To follow Stukely to this famous fight:
               whereas three Kings in person would,
               Aduentrously with courage bould,
               within the battaile shew themselues in sight,
            
            
               
                  Stukely and his followers all,
               of the King of Portugall,
               Had entertainement like to gentlemen,
               the King affected Stukely so,
               That he his secrets all did know:
               and bore his royall standard now and then.
            
            
               Upon this day of honour,
               each King did shew his banner,
               Morocco and the King of Barbery,
               
                  
Portugall with al his traine,
               Brauely glistred on the plaine:
               and gaue the onset there most valiantly.
            
            
               The Cannons they resounded,
               thundring drums rebounded:
               Kill, kill, as then was all the soldiers cry,
               mangled men lay on the grownd,
               And with blood the earth was dround,
               the sun was likewise darkened in the skye
            
            
               Heauen was sore displeased,
               and would not be appeased:
               But tokens of Gods heauy wrath did show:
               that he was angry at this war,
               He sent a fearefull blazing star,
               wherby these Kings might their misfortunes know
            
            
               Bloody was this slaughter,
               or rather wilfull murther:
               Whhere six score thousand fighting men was slaine,
               three Kings within this battaile died,
               With forty Dukes and Carles beside,
               the like will neuer more be fought againe.
            
            
               With woful armes infoulding,
               
                  
                  Stukely stood beholding
               This bloody sacrifice of soules that day:
               he sighing said I wofull wight,
               Against my Conscience heere did fight,
               and brought my followers all vnto decay.
            
            
               Being thus molested,
               and with greefes oppressed,
               These braue Italians that did sell their lands
               with Stukely thus to trauell forth,
               And venture liues for little worth,
               vpon him al did lay their murthering hands.
            
            
               Unto death thus wounded,
               his heart with sorrow sounded:
               And to them all he made this heauy mone,
               thus haue I left my contry deere,
               To be so vildly murthered heere:
               euen in this place wheras I am not known.
            
            
               My wife I haue much wronged,
               for what to her belonged:
               I vainely spent in idle course of life.
               what I haue done is past I sée,
               And bringeth naught but greefe to me,
               therfore grant now thy pardon gentle wife.
            
            
               
               Life I see consumeth,
               and death I feele presumeth:
               To change this life of mine into a new:
               yet this me greatest comfort brings,
               I liu'd and died in loue of Kings,
               and so braue Stukely bids the world adew.
            
            
               
                  Stukelies life thus ended,
               was after death befrended,
               And like a soldier buried gallantly.
               where now there stands vpon his grauē,
               A stately temple builded braue:
               with golden Turrets peircing in the skye.
            
            FINIS.
         
         
            
            A most royall song of the life and death of our late renowned Princesse Queene Elizabeth.
            To the tune of the Ladies fall.
            
               IN England raigned once a king,
               eight Henry cald by name:
               Which made faire Anne of bullaine Queene,
               of England in great fame.
               UUho brought vnto this Centry ioy.
               and to her King delight:
               A daughter that in England made,
               Gods Gospell shine most bright.
            
            
               At Greenwitch was this Princesse borne,
               that gallant place in Kent:
               A house belou'd of Kings and Queenes,
               a house of sweet content.
               Euen in her childhood she beganne,
               so stor'd with heauenly grace:
               That all Estates both high and low,
               her virtues did embrace.
            
            
               
               None like Elizabeth was found,
               in learning so deuine:
               She had the perfect skilfull arts,
               of all the muses nine.
               In Latten Gréeke and Hebrew shée,
               most excellent was knowne:
               To forraine Kings Ambassadors,
               the same was daily showne,
            
            
               The Itallian French and Spannish tongue,
               she well could speake and read.
               The Turkish and Arabian spéech,
               grew perfect at her need.
               Her musicke made her wonderfull,
               so cunning therein found:
               The fame whereof about the world,
               in Princes eares did sound.
            
            
               Yet when her royall parents liues,
               by death were tane away:
               And her deare brother Edward turnd,
               to clodds of earth and clay.
               Her cruell sister Mary sought,
               her lasting greefe and woe,
               Regarding not the guifts that God,
               vppon her did bestow.
            
            
               
               A bloody raigne Queene Mary liud,
               a Papist in beléefe:
               Which was vnto Elizabeth,
               
               a great heart breaking gréefe.
               A faithfull Protestant was she,
               at which Quéene Mary spighted,
               And in Elizabethes mishaps,
               she daily much delighted.
            
            
               Poore maiden by the Bishops wills,
               in prison she was put:
               And from her frends and comforters,
               in cruell manner shut.
               Much hoping she would turne in time,
               and her true faith forsake:
               But firme she was and patiently,
               did all these troubles take.
            
            
               Her sister forthwith gaue command,
               her diat to be small:
               Her seruants like wise very few,
               Yea almost none at all.
               And also would haue tane her life,
               but that King Phillip said:
               Oh Quéene thy contry will report,
               thou hast the Tiger plaid.
            
            
               
               The Lord thus put this King in mind,
               his chosen Saint to saue:
               And likewise to Quéene Maries life,
               a sodaine ending gaue.
               And so Elizabeth was fetcht,
               from prison to a crowne:
               Which she full foure and forty yeares,
               possest with much renowne.
            
            
               She popery first of all supprest,
               and in our English tongue:
               Did cause Gods bible to be read,
               which heauen continue long.
               Poore preaching likewise she ordaind,
               with plenty in this land:
               And still against the foes thereof
               most zealously did stand,
            
            
               The pride of Rome this Quéene abates,
               and spightfull Spaine kept vnder:
               And succord much Low-contry states,
               where at the world did wonder:
               That such a worthy Prince as she,
               should worke such worthy things:
               And bring more honor to this land,
               then all our former Kings.
            
            
               
               The gould stil brought from Spanish mines,
               in spight of all her foes:
               Throughout all parts of Christendome,
               her braue aduentures shewes.
               Her battels sought vpon the Seas
               resounded vp to heauen:
               Which to aduance her fame and praise,
               her victory still giuen.
            
            
               The Spanish power in eighty eight,
               which thirsted for her blood:
               Most nobly like an Amazon
               their purposes withstood.
               And boldly in her royall campe,
               in person she was séene:
               The like was neuer done I thinke,
               by any Englih Quéene.
            
            
               Full many a Tray for since that time,
               she hath consounded quite:
               And not the bloodiest mind of all,
               hir courage could affright.
               For mercy ioynd with maiesty,
               still made her foes her friends:
               By pardoning many which deserud,
               to haue vntimely ends.
            
            
               
               
                  Tirone with all his Irish rout,
               of rebells in that land:
               Though nere so desperate bold and stout,
               but feard her great command.
               She made them quake and tremble sore
               but for to heare her name:
               She planted peace in that faire land,
               and did their wildnesse tame.
            
            
               Though warres she kept with dangers great,
               in Ireland, France and Spayne.
               Yet her true subiects still at home,
               in safety did remaine,
               They ioyd to sée her princely sace,
               and would in nombers run:
               To méet her royall Maiesty,
               more thick then moates in Sun.
            
            
               But time that brings all thinges to end,
               a swift foot course did run:
               And of this royall maiden Quéene,
               a wofull conquest won.
               Hir death brought feare vppon the land,
               no wordes but tales of woe:
               In Subiects eares resounded then,
               where euer men did goe:
            
            
               
               But feare exchangd to present ioyes,
               swéet comforts loud did ring:
               In stead of Quéene the people cryd,
               long liue our royall King.
               Which name of King did séeme most strang,
               and made vs sore to muse:
               Because full many a yeare the name,
               of King we did not vse:
            
            
               But such a noble King he is,
               and so maintaines our peace:
               That we in heart may dayly wish,
               his life may neuer cease.
               His Quéene and his posterity,
               good angels still defend,
               This is my muses chiese desire,
               her melody to end.
            
            FINIS.
         
         
            
            A Song of a Beggar and a King.
            
               I Read that once in Affrica,
               
               a Prince that there did raine:
               Who had to name Cophetua,
               
               as Poets they did faine.
               From Natures workes he did incline,
               For sure he was not of my minde,
               He cared not for women kinde,
               but did them all disdaine.
               But marke what happened by the way,
               As he out of his window lay,
               He saw a beggar all in gray,
               which did increase his paine.
            
            
               The blinded boy that shootes so trim,
               from heauen downe so high:
               He drew a Dart and shot at him,
               in place where he did lye.
               Which soone did pierse him to the quick,
               For when he felt the arrow prick,
               Which in his tender heart did stick,
               he looketh as he would dye.
               What sudden chance is this quoth he,
               That I to loue must subiect be,
               Which neuer thereto would agrée,
               but still did it defie.
            
            
               
               Then from his window he did come,
               and laid him on his bed:
               A thousand heapes of care did runne,
               within his troubled head.
               For now he meanes to craue her loue,
               And now he séekes which way to prooue:
               How he his fancie might remoous,
               and not this beggar wed.
               But Cupid had him so in snare,
               That this poore begger must prepare:
               A salue to cure him of his care,
               or els he would be dead:
            
            
               And as he musing thus did lye,
               he thought for to deuise:
               How he might haue her company,
               that so did mase his eyes.
               In thée quoth he, doth rest my life,
               For surely thou shalt be my wife:
               Or else this hand with bloody knife,
               the Gods shall sure suffice.
               Then from his bed he arose,
               And to his Pallace gate he goes,
               Full little then this begger knowes,
               when she the King espied.
            
            
               
               The Gods preserue your Maiesty,
               tho beggars all gan cry:
               Uouchsafe to giue your charity,
               our childrens food to buy.
               The King to them his pursse did cast,
               And they to part it made great hast:
               The silly woman was the last,
               that after them did hye.
               The King he cald her back againe,
               And vnto her he gaue his chaine:
               And said with vs you shall remaine,
               till such time as we dye.
            
            
               For thou shalt be my wife quoth he,
               and honoured like the Quéene:
               With thée I meane to lead my life,
               as shortly shall be séene.
               Our wedding day shall appointed be,
               And euery thing in their degrée:
               Come on quoth he and follow me,
               thou shalt go shift thée cleane.
               What is thy name, say on quoth he,
               
                  Phenelophon O King quoth she,
               With that she made a lowe courtsey,
               a trim one as I wéene.
            
            
               
               Thus hand in hand along they walke,
               vnto the Kings Pallace:
               The King with courteous comly talke,
               this begger doth imbrace.
               The begger blusheth Scarlet read,
               And straight againe as pale as lead,
               But not a word at all she said,
               she was in such a mase:
               At last the spake with trembling voyce,
               And said O King I do reioyce:
               That you will take me for your choice,
               and my degrée so base.
            
            
               And when the wedding day was come,
               the King commanded straight:
               The noble men both all and some,
               vpon the Quéene to waight.
               And she behaued her selfe that day,
               As if she had neuer walkt the way,
               She had forgot her gowne of gray,
               that she did weare of late.
               The Prouerbe old is come to passe,
               The Priest when he began his masse,
               Forgets that euer Clarke he was,
               he knoweth not his estate.
            
            
               
               Here may you read Cophetua,
               
               through sancie long time fed:
               Compelled by the blinded boy,
               the beggar for to wed.
               He that did louers lookes disdaine,
               To do the same, was glad and faine,
               Or else he would himselfe haue slaine,
               in stories as we read:
               Disdaine no whit O Lady déere,
               But pitty now thy seruant héere,
               Least that it hap to thée this yeare,
               as to that King it did.
            
            
               And thus they lead a quiet life,
               During their princely raine.
               And in a tombe were buried both,
               as writers sheweth plaine.
               The Lords they tooke it grieuously,
               The Ladies tooke it heauily,
               The Commons cryed pitiously,
               their death to them was paine.
               Their fame did sound so passingly,
               That it did pierce the Starry sky,
               And thorow out the world did flye,
               to euery Princes realme.
            
            FINIS.
         
         
            
            A Louers Song in praise of his Mistresse.
            To the tune of Apelles.
            
               IF that Appelles now did raigne,
               who euer sought for to haue fame:
               He might haue wone with lesser paine,
               a greater honor to his name.
               For with great paine he sought all Gréece.
               Till he had sound the fairest péece.
            
            
               Throughout all Greece he could not view,
               so faire, so feate, so sine withall:
               Nor yet his pencell neuer drew,
               so faire a péece and neuer shall,
               Wherefore if he had séene these dayes,
               He might haue wone a greater praise.
            
            
               Oh happy man might he haue said,
               if he had liued to this time:
               For to haue séene so faire a Maide,
               in all proportions made so fine.
               Her sullgent face, so faire, so cleare,
               That Europe cannot shew her peere.
            
            
               
               
                  Plgmalion with his grauers then.
               could neuer worke so faire a péece:
               Nor yet Apelles in his time,
               did neuer sée the like in Gréece,
               For if he had he would haue said,
               That Venus was not like this maid.
            
            
               She is a graft of noble groweth,
               and worthy is she of her fame:
               For why her vertues plainely sheweth,
               that well she hath deserud the same.
               Wherefore my painfull pen alwaies,
               Shal neuer cease to write her praise.
            
            
               O that my pen could print her praise,
               according to her iust desert.
               That I might say and sée those dayes,
               that I desired with my heart
               For still I sought and euer shall,
               My Mistrēs praise might passe them all.
            
            
               Now proofe and praise in one is knit,
               and hath blowne to praise this maid:
               And Iustice doth in Iudgment sit,

               THe Bée doth loue the swéetest flower,

               The Lybard doth loue to lie and pray,
               vpon the faces that goeth him by:
               And I do leue to looke and gase,
               vpon my true loues most pleasant face.
            
            
               
               The Déere doth loue in woods to dwell,
               as I to you the truth shall tell,
               And I doe loue as doth the deere,
               oh whereas I loue would Christ I were.

            A maides complaint for lack of a loue: Expressing the anguish in mind she doth prooue
            
               NO Maiden may so well as I,
               complaine of her hard destiny:
               I am now in prime of yeares,
               yet there is no yong man beares,
               A brest that harboreth a heart,
               that hath compassion on my smart.
               
                  Therefore I am fore affraid,
               
               
                  I shall liue and dye a maid.
               
            
            
               I cast as other maidens doe,
               Amorous glances for to woe:
               Youngmen to settle on my loue,
               but those glances do not proone.
               They are like shaftes by blindmen shot,
               against a marke that nere is hot.

               Higho I loue, yet modesty,
               bids me not be too too free:
               In demonstrating my paine,
               least rebuke and shame I gaine.

               Modestie's too strict a dame,
               to her will I cannot frame.

               who would to modesty be thrall.

            The Lamentation of an Ale wises daughter for the losse of her Virginity.
            To a new tune.
            
               IN the spring time when Plants do bud,
               and birds vse chirping notes:
               When beasts do gather heart of grasse
               and fish in water flotes.
               It was my chance for to espie,
               a Nimph of Venus traine:
               Which in a groue wherein she sat,
               did mightily complaine:
               I hearkned to her sad lament,
               I listned to her tale,
               Whereby it séemed that she had,
               set honesty to sale:
               Alas said shee, that mother déere,
               an Alewise was to me:
               Or that it was my heauie chance,
               to vse bad companv.
               Wo be to him that with the Dyle,
               of Angels me intis'd:
               Thrise woe be to the golden baits,
               that often me surpris'd.
               
                  
Woe to the toyes of youth too rash,
               Woe to the crafty snares
               Of Crooked age, that youth doe catch,

               as they the way do passe.
               Then gushed out the Siluer streames,
               of water from her eyes,

               to make the thing so strange:
               Experience teacheth after full,
               there néeds must be a change.
               The golden baite intised hath,
               the pretions Pearle from met
               Which to be gotten back againe,

               I pray you tell it plaine:
               Faine would I finde some remedy,
               to ease you of your paine.
               
                  100. I thanke you for your kind good will,
               which you did shew to me:
               In recompence whereof I will,
               my words make plaine to thée.
               As nature had aborned me,
               with gifts of beauty rare:
               So for to deck and trim my selfe,
               was all my chiesest care,
               Then many suters came to me,
               and most my betters were.
               Whom I disdain'd and set lightby,
               my minde was to seuere.
               At length there came an aged man,
               
                  
of money store had he:
               Who with his bags and golden baits,
               hath bred my misery.
               My mother yéelded her consent,
               and causd me doe the samé:
               Which maketh me thus to lament,
               that I must liue in shame.
               Let Maidens then example take,
               and warning by my fall:

            A New sonnet of a Knight and a faire Virgin.
            To the tune of Salengers round.
            
               I Read how in King Arthurs time,
               a Knight as he did ride:
               Did méet a Uirgin faire and bright,
               about the gréenewood side.
               Could she w

                  ll or could she wo,
               he lighted of his stéed:
               And there he tooke against her will,
               her maiden head indéed.
            
            
               When this was done this maiden then,
               went raging to the King:
               Bewailing of her pitteous case,
               and told him euery thing:
               The King now hearing her complaint,
               in Stories as I read,
               Commanded the Knight he should be hangd,
               for this his hainous déed:
            
            
               The Quéene alas considering this,
               it was a pitteous thing:
               To cast away so faire a man,
               she begd him of the King.
               Unto the Knight then she began,
               
                  
now prisoner art thou mine:
               For thou shalt dye for ought I know,
               except thy wittes are fine.
            
            
               Yet I will giue thée a whole yeares space,
               to know of woemens kind:
               What thing it is that woemen loue best,
               if they may haue their mind.
               Full sadly went this Knight away,
               some councell for to find,
               To know the cause, to kéepe the day,
               that was to him assign'd.
            
            
               When that the yeare was almost out,
               he came where he had seene:
               Twenty Ladies in a rout,
               all dancing on a greene.
               When he drew néere vnto the place,
               his Question o haue told:
               They vaded all before his face,
               saue one that was ful old.

               Perchance you may pick out of me,
               the thing that you do seeke.
               
                  
He told her then, she said againe,
               if I do it for you:
               You must agree to grant it me,
               that you may easily doe.
            
            
               Content quoth he, come on quoth she,
               haue with you to the Quéene:
               And say that it is Soueraignty,
               that women loue as I wéene.
               Onward they go, the Quéene did know
               the Knight was néere at hand,
               She placed her Ladies all on a row,
               to heare the matter scand.
            
            
               The Knight he gaue his question this,
               my tale was soone exprest:
               It séemes to me, that Soueraigntie,
               is that that women loue best.
               The Ladies all about the hall,
               their verdits soone did giue:
               This worthy Knight, hath hit so right,
               hath well deserued to liue.
            
            
               Then Beldam stept before the Quéene,
               desiring that the Knight:
               Might grant to her vpon the gréene,
               
                  
the troth that he did plight.
               What is that quoth he, mary quoth shee,
               that I may bee your wife:
               Alas quod he, then woe is mee,
               yet rather take my life.
            
            
               There was no shift, but marriage swif

               and both laid in a bed:
               When she did ioy to preeue a toy,
               he turned away his head.
               Sirquoth she, were not you better haue me,
               being both shrewd and old:
               Then to haue youth, that for a truth.
               should make you a Cuckold.
            
            
               But all this while she saw no sm
                     •
                  le,
               nor countenance of the Knight:
               She changed hew, she made her selfe new,
               her beauty was brane and bright.
               Then fell the Knight to louers delight,
               good Lord what dayes are these.
               It was so strange to sée the change,

            A new song of an Hostisse and her Guests.
            To the tune of the painter.
            
               I Wil not to Saint Katherines goe,
               to laugh no more:
               My Hostisse chides and checks me so,
               I am sorry therefore.
               When I came in as merry as a pye:
               she hung she chin, she lookt awry.
               She hould, she scould, she looked so coy,
               I could not be merry I could not ioy.
            
            
               I saw her sit so maidenly,
               when I came in:
               To busse and kisse her curtuously,
               I did begin.
               The more I shewed my countenance free,
               the more be shrewed, the worse was she:
               Her talke so shrill, the time so soure,
               I durst not tarry there halfe an hower.
            
            
               The béere was bitter for my tast,
               I tell you true:
               I came to soone to make such hast, as did ensue
               Yet after al
                     •
                   these comely shewes,
               
                  
as best becomes those friendly shrewes:
               The frownes were gone, and frollick she,
               contented was to welcome me.
            
            
               Then had we that and cheere at will,
               as serued the place.
               A redy friend our pots to fill,
               and fetch apace.
               The Goodman he was not at home,
               the guests were cut ouer heart and come:
               The shrew became a curteous dame.
            
            
               The three hoop'd pot was filled round,
               for lack of cheere:
               Aneats-foot in the towne was found,
               and we drew neere.
               To take our fill of euery ioy,
               our Hostisse was no longer coy:
               But thankes be to God our friends and vs,
               our mallice and all was ended thus,
            
            Finis.
         
         
            
            A Lamentable Ditty on the death of a nobleman who was executed in the time of King Edward.
            
               SHould fortune frowne against the Gods,
               alas and should she so:
               Should worthy wightes of noble blood,
               receiue such mortall woe:
               Alas poore England now alas,
               Thy wo wil shortly come to passe,
            
            
               In time of noble Edwards raigne,
               whose same doth farre resound:
               His vncle deare did truth maintaine,
               and all his foes confound,
               But in the end alas alas,
               his wofull death was brought to passe,
            
            
               His Princely name and courage stout,
               which all men may report:
               Could not defend him from the rout,
               of those that did extort.
               But in the end alas alas,
               his wofull death was brought to passe.
            
            
               
               He was bereft of noble power,
               committed to his charge:
               And cast into the prison Tower,
               his torments to enlarge:
               Where as he lay alas alas,
               to dolefull death was brought to passe.
            
            
               Who then did know the saigned clause,
               wherefore he was condemned,
               Is not the sentence of those lawes,
               of all good men commended:
               O noble Duke alas alas,
               thy wofull death is come to passe.
            
            
               How wast thou led vnto Tower-hill,
               with billes beset about:
               Euen like a lambe contented still,
               before the wooluish rout.
               O Summerset alas alas,
               thy wofull death is come to passe.
            
            
               How did the Common people cry,
               with heaped voyces shril:
               Pardon pardon with hands on high,
               hoping to kéepe him still.
            
            
               
               He stood vpright a noble Duke,
               with constant courage bold:
               Content your selues this was his suse,
               the lawes haue me controld.
               Alas poore soules alas alas,
               your wo will shortly come to passe.
            
            
               Pray for the peace of Edward King,
               your Soueraigue he did say:
               That he may prosper in liu
                     •
                  ng,
               all ye good people pray.
               Least that his foes alas alas,
               do bring his wofull death to passe.
            
            
               Our Summer sweet was thus berest,
               and winter did ensue:
               What carefull hearts to vs were left:
               are since approoued true.
               Oh England cry alas alas,
               that thy woe should come thus to passe.

            A pleasant new Sonnet intituled, mine owne deare Lady braue,
            To the tune of Rogero
            
               MYne owne deare Lady braue,
               would God it were my hap:
               To be the Spanniell that you haue,
               to dandlo in yourlap.
            
            
               Or that 
                     •
                   were so feate,
               to please you with my skippes:
               To take me vp in your conceit,
               to stand and lick your lippes:
            
            
               Or that my pranking pace,
               in all points could agree:
               To touch your traine in euery place,
               at least as neere as he.
            
            
               Or that I could so bragge,
               or simper with my taile:
               To take me vp into your lap,
               to know what I doe ayle.
            
            
               
               Then should I hope and haue,
               each dainty in the dish.
               And harbor like a pretty knaue,
               according to my wish.
            
            
               And sleepe betweene your paps,
               with striking on the 
                     •
                  ead:
               As tenderly each Lady raps,
               such puppies in their beds.
            
            
               Would God you would voutchsafe,
               to grant me halfe the grace:
               A lick or leape some time to haue,
               in such a puppies place.
            
            
               Should neuer faining whelpe,
               so closely kéepe you play:
               For I will neither yaune nor yelpe,
               your secrets to bewray.
            
            
               But what it should behooue,
               A Spaniell to professe:
               To cloake or hide, when you remooue,
               my part shall be no lesse.
            
            
               
               And what doth want in him,
               my fauor might supply:
               For though your puppie can do frim,
               yet not so well as I.
               Perhaps you will forget,
               your puppies dainty toyes,
               When you and I were closely met,
               to play for pritty boyes.
               Then pitty now peruse,
               this written verse of mine:
               Or else the Dog I craue to choose,
               the happy state of thine.
            
            FINIS.
         
         
            A new Sonnet, of a curst wife and her husband.
            
               PAssing along through Redriffe,
               I heard one sore complaining:
               Then streight I drew me neere to him,
               to know the cause and meaning.
               Of this his sorrow, care and griefe,
               which did his minde disaster:
               Alasse sayes he what shall I doe,
               my wife will needs be maister▪
               
            
            
               
               For I may did wo worth the time,
               that ere with her I matched:
               For with her nailes that are so sharpe,
               my face she hath bescratched.
               To a Surgion I was driuen to run,
               for to goe beg a plaister:
               So thus God knowes vnto my greefe,
               my wife will be my maister.
            
            
               I drndge I droile I tosse I toyle,
               till that the day be ended:
               At night I make to her account,
               what monny I haue spended.
               Or else my pockets she will search,
               and say I am a waster:
               Thus like a mome I liue at home,
               and she will needes be maister.
            
            
               For all the paines that I do take,
               yet still she will be chiding:
               Crcept siue groats each night I bring,
               at home thers no abiding.
               She saies that I am good for nought,
               but for some foolish Ieaster:
               With angry browes and deadly vowes,
               she sweares to be my master.
            
            
               
               Thus honnest friend as you haue heard,
               I daily liue in sorrow:
               Of neuer a neighbor that I haue,
               dare I once lend or borrow.
               If I should liue as many yeares,
               as euer did King Nestor:
               Yet in my mind it still me feares,
               that she would be my maister.
            
            
               I dare not stir forth of her sight,
               but when I am a working:
               For her iealous mind doth thinke I am,
               with one or other lurking.
               And if at any time I should,
               but chance to spend a teaster:
               Sheele call me knaue, base rogue and slane.
               and sweares sheele bee the maister.
            
            FINIS.
