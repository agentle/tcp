            Vouchsafe therefore, Right Worshipfull, in the meane time, since I haue no pretious mines, to accept and like wel of this my simple mite: simple I confesse in common valuation: but pretious I dare a

            Wherof when I had marked the commoditie, and sawe that to communicate the same vnto the flocke of the faithfull, were much better, and more thanksworthie, than to keepe it at home in my cofer impounded as my proper possession, and portion of my patrimonye: I was won and perswaded, at the importunate sute and instance of sundrie my trustie friends, who vpon circumspect perusing of the same, gaue it due and deserued commendation, to consent and agree, Authore agrè serente, & prosus inuito, that

it should bee published for the common benefite of the multitude.
            Very loth I was, I speake my conscience, to offend my kinsman and friend in anye pointe of presumption: and muche more loath, I vtter my secret thought, to greeue any godlie and deuout soule, by detaining any thinge, the vse whereof might increase their comfort. But beyng assaulted, as I was, incessantlie, with ve hement perswasions and not able with al my fiue wits, to withstand their weakest reason, I became willing to bee ordered and ruled, as they by discretion mighte dispose me in so honest a request.
            The same not in writing, Right Worshipful, as I had it: but in printe, as you haue it, being the firstlings of a Cheshire wit, gathered in a famous seedeplot of great learning and profound knowledge I present vnto you with suche submission as beseemeth an inferiour to his superiour, a clyent to his patrone, a welwiller to his benefactor.
            Beseeching you, of your accustomed curtesie, that as you haue from time to time beene, not onely an earnest sauourer and furtherer of godlie and zealous men, but also a supporter and mainteyner of vertuous and Christian meanings so it would please you with your title of credit and countenance, as with a shield,

            Thus being married before such witnesses, we cannot reclaime our league of chastitie, vnlesse we wil haue God himselfe, and our mother the Church, and Christ himselfe with al his holye espouse, to beare witnesse of condemnation against vs, to the ioy of Satan our capital aduersarie.

            Wherefore, when man is enuironed with enimies, when a guilty conscience warreth against him, when the world by falshood, and the flesh by her allurements is about to deceiue him then is standeth him vpon to take praier in hande, that hee maye bee able to conquer al those monstrous Hydras or rather deceitful whors, which

            And therefore the Lord our gratious Sauiour weighing with himselfe not so much mannes naughtinesse, for the which bee deserueth a diuorcement: as Satans woonderous pollic

            Come vnto me, saith he, al ye that are heauy and laden, and I wil refresh you. Behold, not withstanding our diuers and sundrie fornications committed with Satan: yet the Lorde our gratious husband calleth vs vnto him, as not willing to diuorse vs: and inuiteth vs to praier, that knowing and acknowledging our owne weakenes, to withstand the whoorish intisemē

            Otherwise, if being tempted we suffer him to ouertempt vs: we shew our selues not onelie despisers of his bloud, but also prophaners of so holie a marriage, which was kept by the blessed and glorious Trinitie in the wombe of the virgine Marie.
            And with what face shall wee present our selues before so louing an husband as Iesus Christ at the day of iudgement, if that we yeeld heere to the i

            Wherefore, where Christ our husband crieth Come: if we will be counted his wiues, and no whores, let vs without lingring, alwaies repaire vnto him in faithfull praier, and let vs

talke with him in his glorious chamber, and beseech him, as he is a louing husband, that he wil take pittie vpon vs, and bestowe vppon vs the gift of spirituall chastitie, that so wee may be defended from the whorish Pharao, whoe goeth about by al meanes to make him a desolate widowe.

euen a dog vn worthie to sit at the table of thy children, or to wait for the crums & of skum of their meat O Lord. But notwithstanding al this, my Lord and my God, I hope thou wilt, not whip me out of thy house, but of a dog make me thy d

                  ild by adoption in thy son Christ, whoe came into this thornie worlde like a morning starre, to guide al straieng dogges to their maisters palace. The woman of Canaan, she confessed hir selfe a dog. Paul was a Saul, such a cur dog as sought by his teethe to teare the lambes of thy pasture, ô Lord: both these dogs did wander in the night of errour, and straie from thee theyr mayster, to Satan thine

enimie, and their aduersarie. But thy sonne, mine only ioy, of meere mercie became a star to conduct them againe vnto thee: and so I trust thou wilte deale with me, O God of com fort, and father of mercie. I doo not doubt but that as I wander in the field of vanitie, so thou wilt recall mee by the light of thy Gospell, by the beames of thy sunne to thine house, there to dwell with thee for euer, Amen.

                  WHat is this worlde, O Lord? it is euill, it is a pallace of vaine pleasure, a cage ofiniquitie, or rather a

lumpe of myserie. And what am I Lord? what am I but a friende of this presente euill world, and an enimie to thee? what am I but a child of wrath and sonne of darknes, so glued to sinne, and lymed with iniquitie, that my bodie is a body of sinne? What then shal I dó? shall the mountaine of sinne oppres me? or the world with the baites of vanitie so choke mee, that I shall neuer like an egle flie to the carcase? nor be able to crie for helpe to thee the onely morning star, which art woont to spread foorth the beames of comforte vnto the needie in time of extremitie? O Lord giue me wings of faith to flie vnto thee, and powre

vpon me the dewe of thy blessing, that I may bud and beare the fruite of holinesse, through the operation of thy gratious beames. Giue mee thy grace that I faile not in my vocation that I may doo good, & eschew euyll, and so make good that vowe, which I made vnto thee in baptisme before beloued Si on. Saue me from falling, and stay my feet from slipping, by thy holy worde, which is the glasse of thy will, & a lanterne to all them that walke in dark nesse, that beeing guided ouer this mistie worlde, I may ariue at the land of promise and pallace of rest in a liuely faith, Amen.

                  QWretch that I am who shall deliuer mee from this body of sin? oh what shall I doe? shall I saye with Caine that mine iniquities are greater than can be remitted? shall the mist of mine iniquities choake me? shall the surging waues of mounting sinne drowne me? or shal I sinke in the pit of desperation? noe: I wil not. For the sunne of mercie can disperse the thick myst and great cloude of mine iniquitie: the parching beame of thy sunne O Lord, is not onlie able to calme, but also to drie vp the angrie floud of sinne:

and so to dash the ship of Satan that diuelish pirat against the sands. So that no storme of the Diuel shal ouerturne mee, no raging blaste of sinne shall dismaie me, no thundercracke of biting conscience shal sinke the little barke of my weake faith, which is grounded vpon a rocke, and ouercommeth the world. Indeed if I were left to my selfe, then were there noe waie but sinkinge and shipwracke: but thanks be to thee O gratious god for it, thou hast not left me to my self to wade in the Gulfe of desperation: but thou hast spred foorth the beames of thy mercie, and by the heate of thy charitie dryed the gulfe, and kept mee from

danger: to thee therefore bee al glorie, Amen.

natural countrie, the blissefull land of Canaan, where we shal not behold this worldly sunne and eie of the world, but thee, euen thee, good Lord, face to face, the sunne of glorye, and onelie starre of maiestie? Such ioyes, O Lord, shal we haue in the beholding of thee, as neyther eie hath seene, nor eare hath heard, nor hart euer conceiued. Such ioys I say, as passe the reach, not onelie of man, but also of Aungels and archaungels to esteeme of. Blessed are the doore keepers of this house of ioye, where thou, O Lorde, the sunne of righteousnes doost most clearely spread foorth the beames of thy diuine maiestie. Ah! how long shal I

liue in prison? how long shall I iournie in this bodie of sinne, before I see thee? Lord, let thy kingdome come. Come Lord Iesus, come I beseech thee; Amen.

It is of iustice that thou haste appointed thine house to be a place of praier: and of dutie therefore that we should pray vnto thee. For thus O Lord I thank thee,

that thou hast made mee thy childe to lodge thee, and I acknowledge that of dutie I am bounde to serue thee. But giue me O Lorde, the grace of thy spirite to conduct mee in the waie of thy wil, clense or create a new hart within me, that I may be a fit lodging for thee, and yeelde vp the sauourie sacrifice vnto thee, which thou requirest of euerye Christian; I meane the sacrifice of prayer the sacrifice of the heart, which sauoureth sweetelie vnto thee, And at this time in hope of the assistance of thy spirit,

But I doo hope good Lorde, that as I am then most vnable to withstande the buffets of Satan, so thou wilte be most readie to succour me: partlye bicause thereby thou shalte vnlocke the rich chest of thine infinite mercie, and partlye because thou louest euerye thinge which thy handes haue made. I will laye me downe therefore in hope of thy protection, to whom be al glorie, Amen.

I did disgrace thy goodnes, and doo deface by my dailie sinnes the image of innocencie, so that I was not onely borne wrapped in damnable estate, but also daily incur the danger of dam nation: and yet doost thou vnderprop mee in the promised seede, in that blessed seede of Abraham, euen thine own and one only beloued sonne Iesus Christ, by whom thou hast redeemed mee. My bodie and soule were maruelously eclipsed for want of grace, and are dailie filthied in the puddle of iniquitie, the reward whereof was death. But what mooued thee I being a cast a way, euen

thine vtter enimie to wash and bathe me in the streame of thy sonnes pretious bloud? I cannot tell good Lorde, it was thy mercy: to thee therefore bee the glorie both now and euer, Amen.

life is like the daie: our Death is like the night: as the day perisheth, so dooth our life vannishe with the vapour: and as night succeedeth the daie, so death followeth life, the tearme and period of these our daies. ô sweet Iesus of thy mercie beat this lesson into my head, and roote it firmelie into my heart, and take away the vaile from my minde, that I may not onelie know and acknowledge, but hourelye remember that I am mortall. For it would bee a bridle to restraine and keepe me from raunging licentiouslie, and a spurre to incite mee to liue holilie all the continuance of this my pilgrimage. Thy spirit hath spoken it: saiyng, Remember thine end, and thou

Giue mee therefore thy grace that I may remember faithfully the night of this my bodye, when I shall sleepe in the bosome of the earth, til ye trumpet shall sound & cal me to iudgement.

Oh, what shal I doe? for thou art asleepe, O Iesus: O maister arise or else I perish, Pharao is at my heeles, the redde sea before my face: how shall I escape? whither shall I flie? O gratious Lorde, make me a waie through the sea before I perish: and drown Pharao my deadlie Saule with all his companie. Remember thy couenant O God of truth, that thou wouldst be with me, and al thy tender chickens to the end of the world, to couer and saue me & them from the roring lion, vnder the winges of thy mercie. This is the wing

Lodge me, ô Lorde in the bosome of comfort, and imbrace me between thine armes in safety, that thou being with mee, no man may preuaile against mee: no not the Dragon with his Aungels, whome thou the true Michael didst not only incounter with but also ouermatch in heauen, as a valliant Captaine: that I trusting in thee, and faithfullie fighting vnder thy banners, may not despaire of the Conquest. Lord and gratious captaine, giue vnto me strength to abidè valiantlie all bruntes of this world, and neuer to shrink

I am better than a pennieworth sparrowe O Lord, who cannot die without thy will and pleasure. Gard mee therefore with the spirit of boldnes, that being asserteined of thy mercie; I may without feare confes thee before men, and so bee confessed againe before thine Angels in heauen. Let no smart of miserie dismaie me, let no thornie Saule discourage mee in the race of my profession, let no sparkes of crueltie or smoke of biting tyranny, choke the confession

thou knowest it, & I acknowledge it, that I am a sprigge of withered nature, a dead branch of the rotten stocke of Adam: what shal I say? a naturall man I am, so blinded with the mist of ignorance and ouershadowed with the cloud of blindenesse, that I cannot do well, or wil wel, no not thinke wel: so vnable I am to aspire to the knowledge of thy reuealed Gospell.

banks of thy cōmandements; from the wombe til this daie I haue with the pirat Satan sailed in the shippe of iniquity, so that I maye saie with Paule: I am cheefe of all sinners. This must I needes confesse to thee, O god of iustice, & this worm of conscience biteth me. What then good Lord? shal ye worme deuoure me? shal this snake of conscience sting me to death? what, good Lord? is the stream of thy mercy stopped? are the riuers of thy grace dried vppe? is there no drop of thy bloud left to washe my seelie soule? doest thou not cal me? saiyng: Come vnto mee. Yes good Lord, and therefore despaire I wil not. It is not thy will that

anie sinner should perish: and thou hast not onely said it, but sworneit, that thou willest not the deth of a sinner, but rather his conuersion and life.
               Behold therefore deere Father, I come vnto thee being a greeuous sinner, in hope of pardon in the name of Christe thy sonne, who by his own testimonie came into this world to saue sinners. Hee was content to blot out that obligation which satan hadde against me, by the flood of his pretious bloud which issued out of hys glorious side. In this poole he hath washed away the leprosie of sinne, were it neuer so desperate. And in token that he is ready to receiue a sinner,

hee stretcheth foorth both his sweete armes, as ready to embrace, and boweth downe his glorious head, as willing to kisse the prodigall childe that craueth pardon for his missespent daies. O Lord and gratious God, I haue wasted my daies in vanitie, I haue from time to time troden vnder my feete the pearles of Christyan profession, euen frō the womb haue I beene a rebellious traitour to thy maiestie, a friend to this world, to godlines an enimie: but nowe O Lorde, I crie vnto thee; forgiue me, forgiue me. Now I come vnto thee, as thou hast called me: now there fore couer me with the winges of thy mercie, and tender mee

as the hen dooth her chickens, least Satan clawe me, and so I perish. Good Lord accept the bloud of thy sonne, the merits of his manhood for a satisfaction for my sinnes, drown them in the streame of thy mercie, & cast them behinde thee, good Lord I beseech thee.
               O sweete Iesus lodge me in thy pretious wounds, and look vpon me with thy piteous eie, least that bee destroied which thou of thy great goodnes hast made, and Christ thy sonne of inestimable loue and infinite charitie hath redeemed, thorough his bitter passion. This is the totall summe of my sute vnto thee Lord: mercie, mercie ô father of mercie: mercie

is the thing that I begge: haue mercie vpon me, haue mercie vpon me I beseech thee louing Lord, haue pitie vpon me. Bee thou my shepheard to defende mee, my Castell of defense to saue me against the gaping diuel. Thou hast store of mercie for them that aske it: O Lorde therefore euen for the wounds of thy deere sonne, haue mercie vpon me, let not sinne sting me to death, but lay to my sore soule the salue of thy mercie, of thy mercie, one drop of thy sonnes bloud, a little dewe of thy blessing, good Lorde, I beseech thee, Amen.

He raiseth vp the snake of my conscience to sting me, & the poison of an euil life to infect mee with the desperat plague of Cains blasphemie: and I am but fleshe vnable to withstande the furie of this dragon. Oh what shall I doo? I am a Sinner, as Satan saieth, and my conscience telleth mee, and the rewarde is death as thy word dooth teach me.

This is the piller that vpholdeth mee from falling: this is the rod of iron that dasheth sa tan out of countenance, and defeateth the argumentes of my sinnefull conscience.

puddle of miserie, into the sea of thy merites for our endlesse safety, Amen.

                  O Thou good sheepherd of our soules, haue mercie vpon vs: thou hast appointed vs as Vicars and Deputies vnder thee, or rather for nurses for thee, to traine vp the babes of thy family in the loue and feare of thee. Giue vs, we beseech thee, the pure milke of thy Gospell to feed them: but especiallie the light of honest conuersation, to guide them out of this vallie of darkenesse, vnto thee the true morninge

starre, and sunne of righteousnes. Arme vs with the buckler of thy truth, that wee may not onlie bicker with, but also put to flight Satan that rauenous Lion O Lorde, who seeketh by subtiltie to trapp and deuoure the lambs of thy pasture. Wepon vs with Scriptum est, It is written O Lorde, which is thy power vnto saluation, and the onely buckler whereby thou didste defende thy selfe in thy threefold combat with Satan. Take from vs the leauen of the Pharisees, the sowred dough of heresies, beeyng the verie canker of Christian profession, and the onely pitch that defileth the table of thy Children, that wee may feede thy

children onely with the worde of thy mouth. This do O Iesus for thine owne sake, Amen.

So that now thy Church O Lorde, is harrowed, little is the flock of thy beloued Steeuen, we haue a great derth of preaching Ieremies, and a verie small number of crieng Esayes to conduct

thy children, the tender sucklinges of thy Gospel, from danger to safetie, out of the rough wildernes of this wicked world. O looke vpon thy little flocke, let the Foxe no more fleece them, but sende shepheards to feed them with the pure milk and sound meat of thy Gospell. Send vs no woolues to teare, but sende vs doggs to defende the sheepe of thy Pasture, against our woluish Pharao, that continuallie gapeth to deuoure thy beeloued Israel. O Lorde haue mercie vppon vs, and let the riuers of thy worde haue free course in euerie chanel: let no puddle of filthy doctrine, or quagmire of damnable heresie trouble

thy little flock & sweet babes, least they tasting thereof, drink their owne destruction. But sende downe thine Angels to cleanse the poole of thy word, mingled with the water of heresie, that wee liyng sicke at the gate of thy mercie, maye descend into it, and so be healed. Grant this for thine infinit mercies sake, and for the glory of thine eternall Godhead, Amen.

                  WHere shall I begin, O Lorde, to rip the vnseamed coate of thy benefites? O that I were al hart to conceiue

or al toong to vtter them; For where we had not onelie loste the inheritance of paradise, but also the integritie of Nature, through father Adams follie: thou hast set down precepts, and elected gouernours ouer youth, that being ruled by tutours, and liuing well by precepts, the childrē of Adam might recouer the disgraced puritie of nature, and at length (of thy meere fauour) be exalted, not to an earthly paradise but to an heuenly inheritance, to enter and inherit the palace of an heauenlie Ierusalem. And whereas, O welspring of all goodnes, thou hast appointed me to view and ouersee the naturall man, not only to train

him vp in learning, but also in liuing: giue me thy grace that I may first of a wilde oliue become a braunch of Iesus, that awaking my selfe with the winges of thy mercie, I maye crowe the better to stumbling Peter, not onely in deliuering precepts, but also examples of godlie life and honest conuersation. Giue me ye true knowledge of thy word, that by it as by a lanterne I may guide my selfe and them the better, from wandering in vanitie, into the waie of sanctitie. Giue me also grace to doo my dutie faithfullie, and imprint in my heart the last daie when I shall render an account of my calling, so that alwaies remembring

it, I may the better fulfil it. O Lord shew thy mercie, Amen.

               O Lorde, giue me grace to bee faithful in my vocation, to bee diligent in my calling to traine vppe youth: but before al things to serue thee. Schoole me, ô gratious God, in the waie of thy wil, and teache me the waie of thy commandementes, that I may not only liue by thee, but in thee for euer. Plant me like a branch of grace in the gardeyn of thy gratious pleasure, that I maye growe in thee, and not in the broad way of iniquitie, or wide fielde of vanitie. Order thou my waies with the rule of thy wil, and guide my steps by this

lanterne of life, that neither for feare or flatterie I swarue from the lessons of thy holie spirite: but euer may walke with the warrant of a good conscience in thy lawe and testimonies. For this O Lord, shal redounde to the profite of thy Churche, whereof by Baptisme I am a member: as also to the bettering of youth which is better schooled by examples of a godlie life, than by precepts of learning. Therefore, O Lord, that thy Church may bee vnspotted and without wrinkle, I beseech thee in thy sonnes name to haue mercie vpon me and al my brethren, which liue in faith and feare of thee, that our good liues maye glorifie

thee our father in heauen: and spur the babes of thy familye, to the perfourmance of their vow, by the power of thy spirit, Amen.

                  O God, we are a cursed progenie, by nature lapt in the bands of sinne, and fettered in the chaine of death, the due rewarde of sinne and iniquitie: but of thy meere mercie thou hast drawne vs vnto thee out of the iawes of our spirituall Pharao, by the death of Christ thine onelye sonne, that mightie lion of the tribe of Iudah, that being deliuered

from the handes of our enimies, wee might serue thee in him al the daies of this our life. But because we cannot of our selues, and by our selues, aspire to the end of our redemtion: we giue thee thankes O Lord, that it hath pleased thee to helpe vs by this meanes, to wit, by placing vs vnder tutors. Thou hast throughlie sifted our nature: thou knowest that there is continuall battell betweene the wanton fleshe and the spirit of sanctification: and therefore to represse olde Adam, and to crucifie the kingdom of the wanton flesh, thou hast put this yoke vppon vs to bee vnder tutors and gouernours to crop the crooked

boughes off, and to mowe downe the ripe haruest of wicked nature, that they might by precepts of life, with the assistance of thy spirite, graffe vs in the true vine Iesus, and also printe the stampe of Christian knoweledge in the tables of our harts: that beeing no base metal but pure and fine siluer, we might (and yet of grace) be weighed in the balance of thy mercie as currant coyne, to be placed in the storehouse of thy ioy for euer. To thee as onlie good, be al glorie, Amen.

Now I come vnto thee with my ten der children, committing them into thine hands, and desiring thee to couer them vnder the winges of thy prouident mercie. Hew and square the rough table of their hearts, of stonie make them fleshie, that being softened by the dewe of thy blessinges, they may beare the seale of adoption in thy sonne Christ. O Lord guide them in this darke vale of vanitie, with the light of thy fauour, that escaping the dungeon of sinne, they may walke in newnes of life, and lodge alwaies in thine

holie will. Imprint in theyr harts faith, hope, humility, and charitie: that following thee they may be humble & meeke as thou art. In due them with the spirite of feare, that they may kisse thee in faith and liue lie obedience, thou beeing neuer angrie with them, but louing them, as the mother dooth her tender sucklings, Amen.

of Heauen, that chyldren shoulde come vnto thee: yea, that all men shoulde be saued, and come to the knowledge of the truth. Fil the cup of thy mercie, O Lorde, and let mee drinke of it, and my children pledge me, that we may together bee wrapped in the garment of Grace, and at length be married vnto thee into the kingdome of glorie. Take my tender babes O Lord, into thy familie, that as children of thy house, together with me, they may sit with father Abraham Isaac and Iacob, at the table of ioy in ioy vnspeakeable, and in pleasure inconceiueable. Giue them the spirite of thy fauour, that they may crie truelie vnto

thee, Abba, Father, assured in their consciences, that they are thy children, and coheires with our Sauiour Iesus of life eternall. O father shew thy mercy for thy mercies sake, Amen.

O Lord renew mee wholie, make me a babe of thy familie, that I may suck the paps of thy word, which is of power to saue bodie and soule. Lop the tree of nature, O gratious God, and restraine me within

the banks of thy wil by the bri dle of thy spirite, that I neuer passing the limites of thy good pleasure, may of thy mercie be taken as worthy to sit with father Abraham in the restefull lande of Canaan. Regenerate me O Lorde, and make mee a new creature, that hauing put off the olde manne, I may bee transformed into thee the second Adam, in newnes of life and be freed from albruntes of storming nature & blowes of tyrannous Satan, that I maie sleepe in the lap of thy Church in safetie for euer. O sweet Iesu, let no tempest of sinne, or thunderboult of Satan or hys mynisters ouerturne mee thy poore Creature, sayling vpon

the foming seas, beset and bea ten with the surges of this present worlde: but gard me with thine hand, and let thine holie Angels pitch their tents about me, least the brickle barke of my bodie being broozed with the waues of wickednesse, and the shippe of my soule shaken with the tempests of iniquitie, I vtterlie come to naught and become a castaway. In al dangers therefore, giue me grace to crie vnto thee with a lowde voice, Helpe mee, thou that canst stil the roughnesse of the sea, or else I perish, Amen.

Giue me thy grace, that I tie not my hart to this world nor locke my thoughts in the chaine of vanitie: but free me from the slauerie of the diuell, and vnlose the desperate knot of my sinneful conscience, that

sinne beeing disiointed by remission, and my conscience vn linked from sinne, I may serue thee in holines and righteousnesse all the daies of my life. Aide mee O father of heauen, when the branch of sinne will ouerwantonlie flourish, & old Adam passe the limits of thy holie will. Doo this, O father, and onely good husbandman, for thine owne sake, Amen.

al come of thee. And me thou hast made a poore handmaid, which I do not only willinglie beare, as knowing thou haste allotted mee this calling: but also very many waies I haue to thank thee for it. For thou hast not onely deliuered me from the slauish seruice of Satan, but also dooest (by this my yoke) restraine the wanton reliques of stained nature, preserued me from the pampering of the old man in pleasure and idlenesse. Secondlie, that I am not seruaunt to any Heathen, Turke, or Saracen: but vnto a Christian, in suche a place, where thy Gospel is preached freely, and fullie. Thirdlie and speciallie, because thou hast called

me vnto such an estate of life, as wherein I knowe I doo well please thee. For who liueth after thy Gospell, if not I, whoe get my liuing with the sweate of my browes? I doo not glory heere in vaine, but to thee bee the glorie, who hast turned the cursse into such a blessing. O Lord giue me grace to consider this, that I may bee more diligent in my calling, more earnest in seruing thee than euer I haue beene heeretofore. Forgiue me al that is past, and guide me in thinges to come, that I may neuer haulte in my vocation. Giue mee a sounde and perfect faith in thy sonnes blood O father, wherin he hath washed (of his great mercie)

my poore soule, that notwithstanding I serue a mortal man, yet aboue him in all thinges, I may serue thee, to whome be all glorie both nowe and for euer, Amen.

                  IN the beginning of the world, O father of heauen, after thou hadst formed man of the slime of the earth, and yet prince ouer all creatures; it pleased thee of thy goodnes to create a woman of his side, as well for his solace, as for the continuance of his seede. It was thy worde vnto them, Increase and multiply.

This increase was easie, but mother Eue hath made it hard (by passing the bounds of thy wil) to al her posteritie: so that the woman conceiueth and bringeth foorth in great paine, and dangerous trauel the fruit of her wombe: in so greate paine O Lord, in such extreme pangs, that vnles thou quench the flame of her sorrowes with the water of comfort, it is impossible for her to beare that into this vale of miserie which thou of thy goodnesse hast fra med, & she conceiued. Wherfore thou GOD of woonders, and Father almightie of Heauen, as thou hast by the slaugh ter of thine only lambe, taken awaie the sinnes of the whole

worlde, and condemned sinne in the fleshe: so take awaie the pangs of childbirth, the fruit of sinne from all womankind, especially this woman, that bearing ioy fullie, that which shee hath conceiued fruitfullie, and thou hast fashioned gratiously shee maye glorifie thee most carefully, and praise thee most thankefully, the onely staie of hir estate in al extremitie, both now at this present, and hereafter euerlastingly, Amen.

Iesu shew thy mercy vnto me, and let the light of thy countenance shine vppon me, that I be not swallowed vp in griefe and sorrowe. Lorde, sweete Lord, thou sendest thy seruants to cal me to the marriage: thy fatlinges and oxen are killed, and Dinner is readie: Lorde giue mee grace to come vnto thee, that beeing freed from sinne, and eased of sorrow, the fruit of sinne, I may mary thee in the couenant of thy mercie, and banquet with thee face to face at the table of ioye, in thy heauenlie Ierusalem. Lord, louing Lorde and gratious God, blesse the fruite of my wombe, and take it into thy famylie. For I beleeue Lorde, that thou

becamest of God the sonne of man, to make it and all other, whome thy father hath giuen thee, the Children of God thy heauenlie Father. According to my faith therefore O Lord, be it vnto me. Open the doore of thy mercie and lodge my child in the vertue of thy couenant, that being my God and the God of my seede, I maie glorifie thee both now and euer, and offer vp the sacrifice of praise, the fruites of a ioyfull spirit vnto thee.

O Lorde comfort me with thy holy spirit against the terror of death: and so roote in mee the hope of saluation, that I may looke in stedfast saith after the night of my passion, to suppe and to be with thee in heauenly paradise. Euill hath beene my life, euen from the wombe haue I

warred with euill nature against thee, and to my power sought to destroy my selfe, and to crucify my Iesus again most villanouslie. But yet O. Lorde and father of mercie, I beleeue verilie that al thy sonnes bloud is not dried vppe. I am persua ded that there are some drops of grace reserued for all laden and labouring publicans, and therefore comming vnto thee I crie and cal: Lorde haue mercie vpon me a sinner: Lorde, O Iesu thou sonne of Dauid haue mercy vpon me. Remember thy bloo die passion, and with the testimonie of most thy holy spirite seale vp in my heart my saluation, that I may die in thee, and so liue with thee for euer, Amē.

O gratious God, looke not vppon my merits, for they are none: nor vpon my life, for it hath been very naught and abhominable, but looke vpon Christ thy deer sonne and my louinge Iesus: who beeing slaughtered vpon the altar of the Crosse, crieth vnto thee for me and my brethren:

Father forgiue thē. Thy sonne O Lorde, died to deliuer vs, was bound to lose vs out of hellish Aegypt, that being freed by him, wee might alwaies and solie serue him. But mercie Lorde, mercie is all my sute: for I haue prophaned his pretious passion by my euill conuersation, and done what laie in my power to crucifie him againe: but notwithstanding Lord, thou art alwaies mercifull and of great pittie: and I beleeue verely, that thy sonnes mercie is not abated, who cried for the butchering Iewes, Father forgiue them. Louing God therefore burie mine iniquities, and accept thy sonnes crie as a satisfaction for my

sinne Lord haue mercie vpon me a sinner, Amen.

Let not this spur blind the eies of christians, let it not shut vppe the windowe of thy will. Thy truth defende O Gratious God, and with the whippe of thy iudgement scourge al penie gospellers, and scowre thy fathers house, which must be a house of praier, that thy worde may

be truly preached, which is thy power vnto saluation. Grant vnto vs the pure bread of life, let it not bee sowred with the leuen of vnseasoned Rabbins, least thy truth being eclipsed with euill doctrine, be vtterly buried, and so thy Lambes for hunger starued. The babes of thy familie do hunger & gape for meat: they dailie crie vnto thee, Father of heauen deliuer vs from euil: Come Lorde Iesus, come: for thou art truth, and the onely teacher of truth. Roote vppe out of thy garden the weedes of heresie, and hinder the blaste of slaundering Trumpetters, whoe dooe nothing else but barke againste thy truth, and bite the good

I confesse therefore O thou iust God and louing father, that I haue merited this bondage, that thou maiest be iustified when thou art iudged. Giue me thy grace O Lord, that I may be diligent and faithful in my vocation, to doo my dutie, not so much for feare as for conscience. Giue

Gard & defend mee with thy grace, and fense me with thy fauour. Vphold my feet frō slipping, staie mee that I fall not, and if I fal, raise me vp that I may not lie in the mire of desperation, when sinne shall assault mee.

Notwithstanding Lorde, because that thou hast commanded all men to aske, and allured them to craue things necessarie by thy promise, that hee that asketh shal haue: therefore, O Lorde, in hope of thy wonted and offered

mercie, I come vnto thee in the names of Christ thy beloued sonne and my louinge husband: desiring thee, in the streames of thy bloodie teares, to wash me from my sinnes, to burie them in the bottome of the sea, and to scatter them as chaffe before the winde, that I being taken into thy fauour, & reconciled to thee in the blood of the immaculate lambe, may looke in assurance for thy fatherlie prouidence. Blesse, O Lord, the curssed earth: so fructifie the barren earth with the deawe of heauen, that we may haue great cause to glorifie thy name, and sufficient for nature againste extremitie, to releeue vs with thy store in

O louing maker and God of peace, it is a pitious thing to see the malice of the world: it is a myserie to behold how thy members disioint themselues

in ceremonies and beggerlie elements: it is a hell to consider how mightie Saule rageth against little Dauid: to see the beastlie crueltie and tiger like tyrannie of the Pharaos of this world, who not tendring their owne case, not regarding the end of thy passion, or full and sole redemption, do racke and rent the babes of thy Church, thy beloued wife. Redresse all this gratious God: eyther cut off our enimies or else conuert them, that wee may together wage battell against the diuell our archaduersarie. Season the harts of our brethren, that wil for a trifling ceremonie, renounce thy veritie, and breake the bandes of Christian vnity.

or else confound our enimies Gratious Iesus, thou knotte of peace, which hast ioyned God thy father and man, not onelie in fauour as friendes: but also coupled vs in one brotherhood with thee, as his children: we beseech thee to sow the seede of concord in vs, that we maie liue in thee as fruitful branches now and for euer. O Lord giue vs thy grace that wee purchase no enuie, nor be the fathers of sedition, of warr, or any insurrection: but imprinte in our hearts thus much, that thou art loue, who shalt come to iudge the quicke and the dead. Charitie shall iudge the world, and confound al bruers of tumults. Ingraue this lesson, O Lord, in

the tables of our harts, and for giue vs al that is past, & guide vs in that which is to come, that we fall not but stande fast in the way of thy will, Amen.

Without thee, ô fountaine of goodnesse, and God of

mine estate I can doo nothing. Arme mee therefore with thy grace, with the buckler of thy word, that I may bee able not onely to war with, but also to ouermatch Satan my deadlye foe, and al his hellish band, setting themselues against thee and thine annointed. Enriche me with thy mercie, that I may bee able to put vpon mee the white raiment offaith, and being clothed with it, may stande sure against the foming minysters of the diuel, that no storm may ouerturne or dismay me. O Lord kepe me from al wrest ling affections, from inordinate motions defende mee, O Lord. Let al discord be remooued, whereby thy pellican children

may be disseuered. But nourishe O God of loue, thy babes with the spirite of patience, that I and they beeing of one minde, may doo our endeuoures, and bende our whole strength to the reedifieng of mother Sion, which traueleth with sorrowes, and sinketh in the mist of heresies, vnles thou pul hir out by the hande of thy mercie: which doo O gratious God, I beseech thee, Amen.

euerie side the flesh assaulteth vs, so that our life may well be tearmed a warrefare, and our daies a treasure of dangers. O Lorde, with the anchor of thy mercie vphold vs, that we sink not in the sea of this troublous time: but guide vs with thy holie spirit, that our liues may please thee, and wee in our death praise thee, through Iesus Christ our Lord. Plant the tree of peace among vs, lette it flourishe to the gladdening of our harts; that al dissention cut off, wee may be linked in one knot of Christian vnitie, gathered into one sheepfold, and guided by thee our onelie and one sheepheard. Let nothing sunder the members of thy

Our liues haue deserued thy whip, the excessiue riot of sinne hath merited the famine and want of thy gratious benefites: but not withstanding louing Lord, burie our iniquities in the multitude of thy wonted goodnes, and blesse vs

with the store of thy mercie, that as wee may nowe declare thy iustice reuealed agaynste sinne: so likewise wee maye preach and blase abroad to the worlde, the bottomlesse pit of thine infinit pittie. O gratious Lord, thou gauest thine onely sonne our Iesus to the death, euen to the death of the crosse by his bitter passion to purchase our redemption. As thou hast giuen him: so good Lord giue vs all thy benefites with him, that as thou hast by him redeemed vs, so wee in him may bee sustained, during this transitorie life, with fulnesse of thy grace, tyll the daie of his great visitation, when meting him in the clouds, we shall be

Foode and raiment, good Lord wee aske no more. Giue vs and grant vs this our petition, and giue vs grace therwith to be content, Amen.

                  she of all his posteritie, father Adam made himselfe thorough follie worse than nothing, a curssed

caitife, euen thine vtter enimie: it pleased thee of vnmerited goodnes, to leaue the colledge of thy Saints: the ninetie nine iust sheepe, the bande of thy blessed angels, to seeke the straieng sheepe, the groate that lost that royall stamp of a pure nature, to the vtter disgracing of all his progenie.
               Man, this loste sheepe thou soughtest O Iesus, thou foundest sweet Iesus, by death thou foundest her, by bleeding paines thou foundest her, by nailed hands and bored feete thou foundest her, by a sharpe & thornie crowne, which pear ced thy glorious head, by sheding of thine owne bloud, by drinking of veneger in thine

extreme thirst, by suffering the most violent death of ye crosse thou foundest her: and so fo undest thy lost sheepe, man, loste man, sinfull man, the childe of wrath O Iesus.
               O louing Iesus & tender harted Samaritan, that of a sicke hast salued, of a sore sinner hast saued him, of a wicked Creature washed him cleane in the streame of thine inestimable mercie. O Iesu, O gratious Iesu, thou hast sought loste man, and founde lost man, by condemning sinne, by breaking the bands of the diuel, by conquering hell, sinne, death and diuel, in the flesh.
               Sith therefore thouhaste, O louing Iesu, pitiful Iesu, of thy

mercy, shed thy bloud, not onlie for my firste father Adam, but also for mee, euen for the whole worlde, that as sinne ouerran al men to condemnation by one man: so in thee al the nations of the worlde might bee blessed. And sith thou hast not onelie made a ful purgation for my sinnes, beeing the slaughtered Lambe that haste taken awaie the sinnes of the worlde: but also soong a conquest ouer sinne, which hath lost his sting, death which was dead, & hel which had lost the victorie, and the dragon which thou ouercammest in heauen, by preaching libertie to Captiues, and leading captiuitie captiue, there is no cause whie

I should faint and feare death.
               Arme mee therfore, O Lord, with this faith, that thou hast dashed Death in peeces with the rod of thy merits, & drowned the diuell in the riuers of thy pretious blood, that no torment or biting paine of the fleshe sunder mee from thee most louing Iesu: but imprint in my heart thy grace, that in greatest anguishe I may be so farre from the feare of it, as rather to crie with thy Sayntes Come Lord Iesu, Come: and desire to bee dissolued with Paule, and to be with thee my louing husband, than by anie panges of death to refuse thee. O Lord doo thy good will, Amen.

There is no remedy but this vessel of earth must bee broken, before I shall see thee face to face euen as thou art in fulnes of glorie. Dust to duste, ashes to ashes, claie to claie, earth muste returne to earth, to pay this borrowed tabernacle to earth where of it came. Grasse must wither, the flower must fade, the vapour vanish, I must be dissolued before I shall be ioyned fullie to thee my head and onelie vine, wherein I liue. Thy purseuant

sicknes must visit this body of sinne, and death muste rowe me ouer the seas of this world, vnto thee in the barke of faith, by the anchor of thy couenāts made to the house of Dauid. O Lord therefore giue me grace to welcome death, by which I must passe to life, that dieng in thee I may be blessed, and liue in the storehouse of thy ioyes for euer, Amen.

passion, and drowned Satan the prince of darkenesse in the streamie floud of thy blessed bloud. Sweet Iesus, louing Lord, and husband mine, lock vp the faith of this thy merit in my heart, and clip mee in the sweete armes of thy woonted comfort. Kisse me, kisse mee, pitious Iesu, pittie mee, and be not angrie with mee. Diuorce me not O mercifull Iesus: but marrie me in mercie, and call me in thy fauor to the mariage of grace, that beeing thine by the testimonie of thy spirite, I may singe with a brasen face: sinne, where is thy sting? hel where is thy victorie?

               Another in forme of a confession.
               
               
                  IN thy name, O Lord, Amen. I acknowledge to the publishing of God his glorie, and the comfort of my soule, that I am God his owne childe, that he hath created me of nothing, redeemed me being lost, & preserued me

from the wombe till this time. In him haue I onely trusted, & neuer shal be confounded. Beloued friendes in the Lord, for your comfort and mine owne duetie, heare my confession, which euery christian is boūd to make. I acknowledge ther fore in the face of GOD Almightie, before you all, that whether I liue or die, I am his. He hath suffered death to saue mee from death, he was crowned with thornes to crowne me with glorie: he was bored and nailed to the tree, to nayle and to crucifie the sinnes of the whole world. He was content to be pearced and goared with a speare, yea so pearsed, that the blood gushed out, and

for nothing else but to washe me cleane from the sore of sin, in the streames of his mercie. For this with one consent lett vs crie, Our soules doo magnifie the Lord, and our spirits rcioise in God our Sauiour. Sccondlie I confesse, that though Christe in his pretious bloud hath clensed me from the filth of sinne, that notwithstanding I doo nothing in this present life, but heape sinne vppon sin, and hourde vp trespasse vpon trespasse, so that this daie is worse alwaies than yesterdaie, by increasing as daies, so sins: and therefore the indignation of God against mee. But yet those of hel shal not be able to preuaile against me. For there

is no condemnation to them that are in Christ Iesus my Sauiour. Thirdlie I confes that as my life is sinful, so it is shorte; like a smoke, like a shaddowe, like a warrefare, like a flower that fadeth, grasse that withereth, a word that soon passeth, it is like a bubble in the water, a weauers shuttle: it is a span long and no moe. Againe it is not onelie short but also miserable. For it is an exile, a vale of miserie, it is a wildernesse, it is stuffed with sorrowes, a cage of enimies, a sea of myseries, a dungeon of gronings & greeuous sobbings: it is a storme, a tempest that wonderfullie trobleth the people of our heauenlie father: beleeue me, it is

no better than a womans trauell, and that is extremelie miserable: and therefore, as not onelie short but also wretched I am willing to forsake it. Yea death, welcome death; sicknes, sicknes of all messengers welcome art thou. Adue vile life, farewell life, sinneful life adue, and welcome death the purseuant of my louing Sauiour: for by thee my miserie shall end. From war to peace, from this stormie worlde into the calme countrie of heauen: from gronings and sobbings, from this vale of fighings, to the pallace of ioy: from earth to heauen, from sinfull men & wild beasts to beloued friendes, by death I shall passe to life, to haue the

companie of holie Patriarkes, and blessed Saints, to haue the sight of the glorious Trinitie, to haue and inherit such ioye, as neither eie hath seene, nor eare heard, nor hart euer conceiued. By death I shal haue libertie without imprisonment, health without sicknesse, ioye without sorrow, plesure without paine, in such securitie, eternitie and perpetuitie as passeth all thoughtes. The holie ones of GOD my father, the blessed Aungels and Archangels they haue atteined it, but neuer can they sufficientlie esteeme of it. So that O death, thou art welcome: welcome sicknes for my Lord Iesus hath new sent thee to fetch me from

this prison to his palace, from a strange contrie to my home, from this place of teares and mourning to the daie of marriage, sweet Iesus to marry thee in thy mercies for euer. Heare deerely beloued, heare and reioyse with me. Sicknes is com, death is in comming as a purseuant from my louing Iesus, to cite me to appeare before him, that he may appoint me a man sion in his fathers house, to sit with him at the table of ioy for euer. O the great ioy and onlie ioy of a Christian; Nowe I shall lie noe more in this prison: nowe I shall haue Paules wish: for I shall bee deliuered from this bodie of sinne: now shal I depart in peace with Simeon

to haue that peace that passeth all vnderstanding, and surmounteth al thought. Now now shall I see the amiable tabernacles of my Lorde: nowe shall I enter the courtes of my God, where one daye is better than a thousande else-where: now shal I be a doorekeeper in the house of mine heauenlie father, now shal I appeare before the presence of God, now doth his kingdome come, now Lord Iesus, now thou cōmest to carrie my soule into ioy, Into thy hands therefore I cōmit my spirite. Beloued brethren this is my testamente, which I leaue vnto you, it offereth great ioye, and no matter of Teares. Shead therefore no

teares, for better is the daye of death than the daye of birth. I entered my life with a crye, it coste my mother payne and teares to beare mee, but yet it cost my louing Iesus his bloud to saue mee, you, and all the world. Enuy not therefore my luckines, that now I shall passe from you out of this vale of teares, vnto him who died that I with him mighte liue in ioye for euer.
               If you will mourne, mourne for your owne sinnes, mourne for your selues, that you shal not so soone sup with God my father as I shall doo: & mourne not for me, for you shall shortly follow me, and lose me but for a time, when you shall see

in heauen for euer. For blessed are the dead that die in ye Lord, whose name for euer bee glorified, Amen.

that notwithstanding our merited pouertie & deserued nakednesse, by rebellion against thy Maiestie, thou shouldest thus cloath me with thy benefites: with plentie against penurie, with friendship against enimitie, with health against sickenesse, with store against needinesse. This O Lord, is an vnmerited benefite, for the which after my bounden duty, I giue thee harty thankes.

notwithstanding all this their tyrannie, Father forgiue them, and pardon mee, as I forgiue them that haue trespassed against me. Rake the fire of charitie out of the dead ashes, and quicken it O Lord, that I may warme mee in thy familie, in time of extremitie: and they be ready in thy great audit to render a full account of theyr stewardshippe vnto thee. But first of all doo I begge grace of thee, that I may euer seek thy kingdome, and so bee persuaded in hart by thy word, that I shal want nothing, but that all other things shal be added vnto me. This doo I aske of thee, O father of Heauen, that euer criest, Aske & haue. Giue mee

But yet O Lord, I beseech thee forgiue them, and denye mee not the crums of thy grace: but looke vppon me with the pitious eie of thy louing countenance. Assist mee so O Lorde, with thy holy spirit, that being alwaies content with my calling, I may seeke to serue thee

in holinesse and purenes of liuing without feare al the daies of my life. Beate me with pouertie, beate me O Lord, strike wound, doo thy good will, ô louing God: so thou saue mee of thy mercie, wherin lieth al the ioy of my soule. Giue mee thy grace, neuer to misdoubte thy prouidence, that neuer doubting of thy fatherly care, I may with a gladsome heart endure the end of my warrefare. Giue me a contented minde, let thy wil be my wil, and my will alwaies answerable to thy will, that I neuer offende thee, but doo my dutie in louing thee, & wishing well to all the world, Amen.

The bandes of death haue sundered mee from him: but I hope O Lorde, by the power of thy holye spirite, that nothing shall bee able to separate mee from thee myne onelye Iesus, the onely ioye of my soule, put the axe of thy

mercie to the roote of wanton nature, and cut it off: that I doo not marrie the vanitie of this wicked worlde: but put vpon mee the garment of innocencie, and tie about my hart the iewel of faith, that I may onelie marry thee in the couenant of thy heauenlie father, louing Iesus, and haue nothing to doo with the adulterer the Dyuell, the father of deadly fornication.

And what was in cause? surelie not my merit, for I was not before thou madest me: it was thy mercye, good Lorde, the true mother of all mankind.

As Pilgrimes wee wander from place to place, and are driuen with the winds of pinching pouertie vpon the seas of this worlde to seeke reliefe: but alas and woe to the world for it. The rich man deuoureth all superfluitie, or else hourdeth vppe to fill hys Garners niggardlie: so that Lazarus may not onely walke amid the streetes naked, but also lie begging at the gates full sore, and yet go without the crums which fall from the Table, to ease the tune of his necessitie. O Lord therfore do I flie vnto

thee: haue thou mercie vpon me, for it is onely thou which fillest with thy blessing euerie liuing thing. I am better than a farthing sparrowe O Lorde: thou knowest it and I acknowledge it to my comfort. Feede my soule with the fleshe of thy sonne, and set me drinke of his bloud, that seeking firste thy kingdome, I may in the end be crowned with glorie, and sit at the table of ioy in heauen with thee.

Yea this case of the soule is such a cage of filth, as a man of God hath said, that no Bocardo, noe dungeon, no sinke, no puddle, no pitte is in any respect so euil a prison for this bodie, as the body is of the soule. For it is suche a case, as stinketh in the sight of God, a bodye of sinne is this cage of the soule, and therefore cried Paule out, oh wretch that I am; who shal deliuer me from this bodie of sinne?
               Beholde deere Chrystians, such an heauie burden was the bodie to the soule, that Paule

was willing to giue this world a farewel, & with father Simeon hee wished that hee might depart in peace. Oh that we had this courage of Paule! or were as godlie wise as Dauid, to locke that vpp in the closet of our heartes, which they had fullie digested. For then wee shoulde haue a wished famine of mourning Christians, on rather vnchristian Painims, who dooe weepe and waile for the dissolution of this earthie and fraile tabernacle, which Dauid longed for, and Paule with father Simeon desired.
               Dauid that father of the faith ful and mouth of the holie spirite, he was a man after GOD his owne hart, whom God had

spiced with grace, and made of his mercie a vessel of honor. He was a piller of mother Sion, he liued in the childhood of the Churche, when the cloud of the lawe did yet ouershaddowe the appearance of the sunne in fulnes of comfort. He desired to se the day but could not see it, which is nowe paste, wherin the sonne of God hath opened fully the storehouse of ioy: and yet beeing wearie of the burthen of his bodie, and willing to forsake it as a most stinking prison house, without feare of death he crieth out, Oh how long shall I lie in this prison?
               Paule ioineth hands with father Dauid, euen Paule, that

notable Organne of the holie Ghost, who saide of himselfe: It is not I that liue, but Christ that liueth in mee. Hee that in body saw the Lorde, and knew that as a vapour his life should vanish, & so he in a small space should suppe with his mayster Christe in heauen, after his ascension: yet carriyng about himselfe this case of the soule, accounteth himself wretched, and therefore cryeth out: Oh wretch that I am? who shal deliuer me from this body of sin? As if hee shoulde haue saide, I knowe that the time will come when men will faint in faithe, and broch infidelitie: when this life shall bee more loued than wisely lothed, & this bodie

more esteemed than godlinesse wil suffer. I knowe foolish parentes will be so be witched with the immoderate loue of their children, that they wil grudge at the will of God, when he calleth them, and sorrowe and sighe a long time after their departures, which is both sinne and follie. But I tell them that they ought to reioise, bicause they are rested from theyr laboures, bicause they are passed from Death to life, because they are blessed. For wretch, O wretche that I am! who shal deliuer mee out of this body of sinne?
               The bodie which you haue lost, is but a bodie of sinne, it is but a prison of the soule, as father

Dauid speaketh, it is but a burthen of the soule: so that by Death they are deliuered from sinne to safetie, from imprisonment to libertie, from a yoke of myserie to endles felicitie: and therefore, oh wretch that I am, who shal deliuer me from this body of sinne? Paule indeed knewe that this world was an exile, and Heauen his contrey, that he was a pilgrim, this world but an Inne, & heauen his home: nay at a sight of his owne Countrey when hee was rapt, hee saw at his owne home, whence by sin hee was banished in Adam, such ioyes as eie neuer sawe, nor eare heard, nor heart euer conceiued. These are the ioyes which

shal endure for euer, for number vnmeasurable, for durance perpetual, and without end or period. And therefore let euerye Christian bee readie and willing, in ioy of spirit to welcome death, & in token thereof learne to crie out with Paule: Oh wretch that I am, who shal deliuer me from this bodye of sinne?
               Lette vs account our selues wretched, as long as we carry this weede of earth aboute vs, vntill our soules bee vncased, and wee deliuered from this body of sinne. But if examples will not bee of force to schoole vs, yet let nature speake and preuaile. The seconde causes whereof you are made, are the

foure elements, which concur to the constitution of euerye mixt creature, and being euer at combat, doe also naturally worke the shipwracke of the same, according to the common axiome & rule of nature. The causes of corruption are all one with the causes of gene ration: and therefore vnlesse we wil denie nature, and be vn thankful to God for our creation, we may not in anye case feare death, which is mothered vpon nature our common and generall mother. But if neyther example nor Nature will or can preuaile, yet let the authoritye of our Heauenlie Creatour, and his wisedome compell vs to welcome death,

and to accept willinglye the condition of our bodies.
               Our bodies and soules God created, he made them by the power of his almightie hande, and hath lente them vnto vs but for a time to vse, til mother earth require the bodie, and he our soules. For, as of earth wee came: so into earth wee must returne againe: & therefore vnles we will be vnthankfull to nature, and rebellious to God, wee must bee willing to paie our debts vnto him, least if we doo it not, he cast vs into prison, til we haue paid the vttermost farthing. So much for thy bodie.
               Now consider thy soule. As thy bodie is a prison, so is thy

soule during this pilgrimage a prisoner; as it is a body of sin, so is thy soule lodged in a most stinking prison: as it is of earth earthy: so is thy soule an exile from heauen, heauenlie: & ther fore to feare death, it is to feare the deliuery of thy soule from prison, which is meere follie: it is to wish a stinking lodging and a filthie cage to dwell in, and euer to carie it about thee, which is a very harde and extreame misery: it is to wish thy continuall banishmente from the ioyefull realme of heauen, thy natural countrey, which is extreame madnes. So that vnles you wil be counted foolish, wretched, carelesse and mad, who are willed to be as wise as

serpents, you muste in no case feare death, which is the best ghest that euer came to the godlie. For now there is not cōdemnation to them that are in Christ Iesus, but blessed are the dead that die in the Lord.
            
            
               The second weapon: Consider thy life.
               
               
                  IT is short, vncerteine, and miserable. It is short: for man that is borne of a woman hath but a shorte time to liue: the daies of man are the dayes of an hyrelinge, yea winde, and nothing: as father Iob telleth vs. A man in his time is but grasse, and flourisheth as a flower of the field.

For as soone as the wind goeth ouer it, it is gone, and the place thereof knoweth it no more: as the prophet Dauid teacheth
               There is a time to be borne, and a time to die. And man is like a thing of naught, his daies passe away like a shaddowe. It is the proclamation of the Lorde, vttered by Esay, that al flesh is grasse, and al the glorie of man as the flower of grasse. And it is tolde vs by Paule, that heere we haue no continuing cyttie, but wee seeke for one to come. This is it which is shaddowed vnto vs in sundrie similitudes. Saynt Iames sayeth: Our life is euen a vapour that appeereth for a little time, and then vanisheth away. Our

daies on the earth also are but as a shadowe, & there is none abiding. They are like a bubble in the water, like a weauers shuttle, like a smoke, they are like a thought, soone conceiued, and soone ended. Dailie experience dooth teache vs thus muche. For wee see, that by some storme or other, the greene apple falleth before the mellowed fruite, the lambe is brought to the slaughterhouse as wel as the sheepe, the chicken is killed for the broath as wel and sooner than the cock: yoong men passe awaie as wel as old, our daies are short, our life is as the shadowe.
               Now therefore reason with me. Shal we feare death for the

losse of a shadow? shal wee by sighs and sobs storme againste the Lord for the losse of a vapour? nay, shall we not rather be glad to forgo the shadowe, and by death desire to be knit more fullye to our bodie Iesus, whereof wee are members in faith and hope? O ye of lyttle faith, crie vnto the God of hea uen: Lord increase our faith. Be content to leaue this vaporous life, and welcome death, and cry in a ful beleefe. Come Lord lesu, come, shorten these latter daies for thine elect sake and saue vs. Saue vs, O Lord saue vs, haue mercie vpon vs, and helpe vs, helpe Lord, and by a blessed death cite vs to appeare before thee. For one

daie in thy court, is better than a thousand elsewhere, Amen.
               Secondly, consider that thy life is vncerteine. For death is like a theefe that commeth at vncertaine houres, he is like a thundercracke, that soundeth on a sudden: yea, this life is so vncerteine, that death may ask his due in the swathcloth, and none be able to resist him. He is alwaies a prince, hee ruleth not only in the haruest, but also in the spring time and summer Yoong menne and babes olde men and maydes, greene and ripe, al are one: death excepteth no persons, hee neuer regardeth our yeares, but with his sharpe syth on a sudden he cutteth al downe. So y• our life

is like a ruinous house, alwaies readie to fal: like a thin thred, alwaies readie to rotte: like a running cloud, wherof we are vncerteine, where and when it falleth. This cloud sometimes melteth in the cradle, somtims in the chaire. Death is like the sunne, whensoeuer it shineth, it melteth our cloudie life, bee the cloud thereof neuer so thin or thicke in yeres.
               Our life nowe being as vncerteine as the weathercocke, which turneth at euery blast: or like the waue, which mounteth at euery storme: or lyke the reede which boweth at euery whisteling winde: whye shoulde we loue it, and not rather loath it, in comparison of

the euerduring life of the heauenlie citizens, wherevnto by death we passe in mercie, Oh that al Christians woulde ingraue in their harts, the wauering dayes of this vncerteine life, and consider and looke for in a ful faith, the certaintie of that ioyfull life, wherevnto death dooth bring vs; For then woulde wee, that sayle as pilgrimes on the waters of this world, and are tossed dangerouslie by diuers pyrates, the flesh, sinne, and the diuell, desire, & with hartie praier craue of the Lorde, that in the barke of a liuely faith, by his mariner death, he woulde carrie vs to the certeine and blessed life of his saints.
               
                  
If we were thus godly wise to consider the vncerteintie of this momentanie life: or so happie, as to ponder the eternall felicitie of Ierusalem, and restful Cannaan, we would rather ioy and be merrie, when sicknes and death shal visit vs, than mourne and sorrowe for it. For they are the Lords ambassadours, which are sent to bring vs tidinges that dynner and supper is readye, and the banket of glorie to bee minystred: and that we must come without tarrieng to marrie him, and to enioy him face to face euen as he is: and 
                     〈…〉
                  
                  fore with willing mind t
                     •
                   
                  
                     •
                  aie our debted bodies to mother earth whereof wee borrowed

them: and to him our soules, that hee may marrie them in the couenant of his Eternall mercies.
               We are borne into this world naked, our heritage is sin and myserie, our life is labour and sorrowe, we our selues are but tenaunts vnder mother earth, concerning our bodies: and vnder GOD, concerning our soules: which God, our God of ioy and father of comforte, by his owne sonne, hath bought vs an inheritance immortall, and vndefiled for euer, vnto the which by sicknes & death, as the messengers of his wil, he calleth vs.
               Is all this so? and shall wee feare death? no: for shame let

vs bid adieu to this shorte and vncertaine lyfe, and receyue death in ioy of spirite, as an accomplishment of the obligation of his couenant, wherewith he bound himselfe of his meere mercie, beyond any merite of ours, that wee shoulde neuer see death, but haue euerlasting life.
               Vnlesse therefore you will mourne against death, bicause by it you passe from an vncerteine, to a certeine life: from these sorrowing and wauering daies, to an euerlasting and incorruptible inheritance: and so shew your selues rather willing to haue the fleshepots 
                     〈◊〉
                   Aegypt for euer, than to passe to heauen, and to eate of comfortable

manna, not in the wildernes, but in new Ierusalem: see that ye feare not death, but loue it, and welcome it, whensoeuer the Lorde will sende it vnto you.
               Thirdlye, consider thy life is miserable. It is not only short, but also miserable: yea, I may well tearme it a kingdome of miserie. New borne babes do what they can, to persuade vs of the truth of this matter. For they beginne not this life with smiling countenance, but with weeping eies. By their crie what else dooth nature sing or signifie vnto vs, but that thorough our sinnes, our life is become a continual warfare, and the world our enimie, euen 
                     〈◊〉
                  
                  
vale of miserie, besette with thornes to pricke vs on euerie side.
               Righteous Abell founde in his life time a thorn of his own blood to trouble & molest him euen Caine his own brother to bache his blade in his bloud, & villanouslie to murther him. Iohn Baptist, the bright dayestar, and forerunner of Christ, the sunne of righteousnesse, he found a thornie Herode to behead him, and holie Stephan stonie Iewes to dispatche him. Yea, what is this life but a fardle of miserie, wherein Christ our blessed sauior tasted of nothinge, but of the sower grape of persecution? For, no sooner was this lambe of God come

into the world: but Herod, by the decree of his hellishe conuocation, was ready to deuo
                     〈…〉
                   him: this was a miserie to mother Marie. And maruelouslie doth it paint out the mysery of this life, that the hony babe Iesus, the very lambe of God and light of this world is so welcomen into the world, which intended mischiefe.
               And where hee by the prouidence of his heauenly father, escaped the snare of the rauenous fowler, yet for his sake doo the children and sucklings of Bethleem and the coastes thereof, as many as were twoe yeeres old and vnder, preache vnto vs the miserie of this our life. The voice that was heard

in Ramah, moorning, weping, and great lamentation. Rachell 
                     〈…〉
                  eeping for hir children, with out all comforte, because they were not, teacheth vs, and crieth out vpon the miserable life of man.
               If al careles Epicures would aske the iudgement of Father Iob in this case, he would expounde the mysticall cries of tender sucklinges, that man which is borne of a woman, hath not onely a short time to liue, but also a miserable life to lead: that his life is a warfare, continual labour and sorrow. This iudgement of Iob, without all doubte was rooted in him and his brother Ieremie. And thereof it came, without

question, that they did cursse, not onlie the daie of birth, but also him that brought the message to their father, that a child was borne. They had fullie considered the degrees of their miserie. Their birth place was but a foule and filthie dungeon, they themselues were but a substance of bloud and instruments of their mothers: their nourishment little better than venom, & their birth not without extreme pains of the deere mother, and violent offense of their tender bodies.
               They knewe throughlie that they were conceiued in filth and vncleannes, born in sinne and care, and nourished with paine and labour. They dyd

knowe themselues to haue bin like cralling wormes, and that at their entrie into this worlde they were apparelled with bloud. And therefore considering their miserable condition they curssed the daye of their wretched birth.
               Yea, this made father Ieremie to wishe, that his mothers wombe hadde serued for his tumbe: and father Esaie to bewaile his birth, and to murmur againste the knees that helde him vppe, and also the breasts that gaue him suck. They had fully conceiued, that man was made of the slime of the earth, conceiued in sinne, borne in paine, and at the laste made a prey for wormes. This miserie

of mans life had they fullie digested, and therefore wished to haue died before they were borne.
               Come hither nowe, beloued Christians: wee are manie an ace short of Iob, Ieremie, or Esay, in life and in iudgement. One, after a through sifting of this miserable life, wished that his mothers wombe had been his tumbe: another murmured at the paps that gaue him suck the third curssed the daie of his birth: and not onelie that, but him also that firste declared it. Did they soe lyttle sette by this myserable life, as to cursse it: and so little loue the pappes that norished them, as to murmur against them: yea, the verie

knees that helde them vp, and by reason of this wretched pilgrimage, to be so wearie of this life, as to wishe they had beene buried in their mothers wombe? and shall wee feare death?
               They wished they had neuer liued: and shal we, for feare of death, wishe euer, or a longe time to liue? they curssed the daie of their birth, whoe were holie men: and shal we weepe for the daie of death, the verie ende of their wishe? did they murmur against the paps that gaue them sucke, and shall not we welcome death, when the Lord sendeth him? naye they murmured euen againste the knees that did beare them vp:

and shal not we bee willing to surrender heade, feete, handes, heart, knees, and al, to mother earth, and to salute death in ioy of spirit?
               Fie for shame! and out vpon vs! if we doo not willinglie and merrilie wishe, and crye: Thy kingdome come, ô father of heauen! Come Lord Iesus, come. Let vs denie the olde man, & cherish our hope that wee haue in the full merites of Christ: that when the Lorde shall call, we may come vnto him, without anye rebellion. And as for death, account of it but as a moste blessed ende or period of this wretched life, & an axe that cutteth off al miseries: and therefore feare it not.
            
            
               
               
                  The thirde weapon: Consider the commodities of death.
               
                  WE are tossed & turmoyled vppon the seas of this world, with manie a dangerous tempest: euen till wee be we arie, or at least should be with holie Paule, of our short, vncerteine, & miserable liues▪ and then dooth the Lorde, euen of mercie, call vs to reste and ioy with his Saints in heauen 
                     〈◊〉
                   that resting from our labours, wee may continuallie pray se him with the band of his holie Angels.
               By death he deliuereth vs from danger, and therefore to

arme vs against the feare therof, it pleased the holie spirit to cal death a sleepe: by the which being dispatched of all aduersities, wee are brought to our graues, therein to lie, as it were in a soft featherbed, and in a sweet sleep, abiding the comming of Christ our lord, whe
                     •
                   hee shall knocke at the bedd
                     •
                   and cal vs vppe, to liue for eue
                     •
                   with him, and his holye Aungels.
               Death therfore doth not swalow vp our bodies, thogh for a time they must lie in the bellie of mother earth. For death is a sleepe, and is vnpossible as it is, that a whole man being in a sound sleepe, should not wake vp againe: euen so vnpossible

is it, that a Chrystian shoulde continue in Death for euer. And as for this sleepe, it is but a shorte sleepe: for the daye is at hand, and the time of iudgmente draweth neere, when dead bodies shall arise, and the earth shal render them vp, that be in her, that meeting and appearing together, with our beloued friends, and set vpon the right hand of his blessing, wee may as liuely members be fully knit in our body Christ Iesus.
               So that death is but a sleepe, and a shorte sleepe, out of the which, we, and al our brethren sisters, and friends that are departed in the Lorde, shall rise, more fresh than euer we were,

to leaue this fraile and earthie bodie, and to haue it made like to the glorious bodie of Iesus Christ.
               And who now would feare death? or who should grudge at the Lorde for castinge vs asleepe? Death is a sleepe, the earth is the Christian mannes featherbed where he must lie
                     •
                   till the trumpet shall sound to awake him and call him vnto iudgement. Who wil murmur againste this necessitie? or rather againste this mercie? for mercie it is, that we die but for a time, or rather sleepe for a time: where of merit we shuld die for euer.
               And therefore vnles by your gronings and sighings you wil

exclaime against the mercy of the Lord, by the which you are saued, doo not feare Death, or murmur against him: but bles him with father Iob, and thank him hartily that he hath granted thee thy daielye petition, wherein thou praiest, sayeng: Our Father which art in heauen, thy wil bee doone, deliuer vs from euil.
               For, as for the first, his will is doone, whensoeuer any man dieth. The verie farthing sparrowe can not fall without his prouidence: the heares of our head can not perishe, without his will: much lesse dieth anie man without his will, whoe far surpasseth all farthinge Sparrowes. So that to wishe them

aliue that are departed in peac it is to wishe, that God his wil were not doone: and what is that, but to wishe that GOD were no God? For if God bee God, his wil is iust, and muste needs be doone.
               But as for many, they will acknowledge that the will of God is doone: againe, that hi
                     •
                   wil was iust in calling for their children, whome hee had but lent them for a time: and yet will carrie a biting sorrowe in their hearts, and so wil they go neere to bringe death vppon themselues. But to such mourning mothers I saye, Why doo you mourne? this life is a warfare, death is asleepe. Why do you mourne? this life is short,

by condition and ful of myseries: by death they are blessed, and rest from their labors.
               Why doo you mourne? this life is a vapour: by death, for a vapour, they possesse an heauenlie and euer during inheritance. Why doo you mourne? doo you not thinke that heauen is better than earth: that the companie of angels, archangels, Patriarkes, Prophete
                     •
                  , Apostles, Martyrs, Confessors, Virgines, and the holy ones of God, is better than the felowship of men, and the company of beastes.
               Doo you not beleeue, that ioye is better than sorrowe? that life eternal is better than this short, vaine, and vile life?

that it is better to see God face to face, & to follow the lambe Iesus in heauen, in fulnesse of ioy to possesse him at his Heauenlie table to banket with father Abraham, Isaac, & Iacob, than to dwel with you? all our fare in this worlde is dung in respect of the heauenlie meat, which Christ dooth set before them that are passed by death to life: and why then doo you mourne?
               Mourne not for them, for they are happie: happie and thrise happy are they. But as I say, mourn for your selues that be not so luckie as they; to bee taken from this vale of myserie to the storehouse of felicitie, as they are. For by deathe

they are not dead, but by death they are passed to life, to suche a life as passeth all vnderstanding, the ioyes wherof doe surmount the conceipt & thoght, not onely of man, but also angels and Archangels.
               But miserable are you, which doo yet carrye about you this earthie Tabernacle: yea euen in this one thing you are miserable vnlesse you repent, that you mourne for the deathe of your friends or children. For in that you denie the will of God to be iuste, for that hee hath made man of earth, earthy and mortal.
               Mourne for this your vnbeleefe, mourne for this your sin, weepe for the sinnes of your

youth, for your secret sinnes: and desire God to wipe and to wash your soule from all infection of sinne, that being prepared by death to follow your friends and children, you may with willing hearts in a liuelie faith, giue a farewell vnto this worlde, and be readie to marrie Christ Iesus in glorie: to whome bee all glorie, Amen.
            
         
         
            
            A battel betweene the Diuel and the Conscience: Wherein all true Christians are taught how to oppose and set them selues against the assaults of their Archaduersary Satan, made in forme of a dialog, by the sayde E. H.
            
               Satan.

               Conscience.
               I am a sinner Satan: I confes it, that in mee, that is in my fleshe,

dwelleth no good thing, which may mooue my Lorde to take pitie vpon me: but yet I denie thy consequent. For though I bee a sinner, yet shall not my sinnes preuaile against me. For behold, saith Iohn, The lambe of God hath taken awaye the sinnes of the worlde, hee hath condemned sinne in the flesh, so that now there is no condē
                  nation to them that are in Christ Iesus.
            
            
               Satan.
               I grant that there is no condemnation to them that are in Christ, but suche are in Christ, which walke not after the flesh as thou dooest, continuallie boording vp trespasse vpon trespasse against the daie of iudgement.
            
            
               
               Conscience.
               Thou liest Satan. I walke not after the fleshe, but with Paule I wil the thing that is good, though I bee not able to perfourme it, by reason of that combat which is between the flesh and the spirit. Indeed at the least I sinne seuen times a daie: but notwithstanding, auoid Satan: for Iohn telleth mee, that if anie manne sinne, wee haue an aduocate, with the Father, Iesus Christe the righteous, and he is the propitiation for the sinnes of the world.
            
            
               Sat.
               But how knowest thou that he wil be thine aduocate? For hee is a righteous mediatour, and therefore he will not deal for thee 
                     〈◊〉
                   most miserable

sinner.
            
            
               Con.
               I knowe it Satan, that hee wil be mine aduocate. For so his holie worde preacheth vnto me, which is the word of Christe the euerlasting truth, which I by his grace wil neuer misdoubt. And heerein thou shewest what thou hast beene, euen from the beginning a lier. For Iohn telleth mee, that If anie man sinne, yet there is an aduocate, and a righteous aduocate, euen Iesus Christe the righteous.
            
            
               Sat.
               Yea, but how darest thou looke vp to heauen, and fly to this aduocate, thou beeing a vile sinner, and hee a righteous God?
            
            
               Con.
               In a ful faith of his mercie,

Satan, I dare goe to him, For hee crieth to all laden and labouring Christians: Come vnto me. And why then shuld I feare to goe vnto him? especiallie, since he hath promised to refresh mee, If I come vnto him.
            
            
               Sat.
               Thou maiest goe vnto him, but thou shalt find him a iudge. For he wil neuer refresh thee with mercie, but punish thee with deserued iudgement and reward thee according to thy deserts.
            
            
               Con.
               Auoid Satan: for thou liest. I will go to him in assurance of his mercie: for hee is truth, and cannot faile in his promise. Hee will indeede reward me according to my deserts:

but what deserts? Christ his deserts are my deserts: hee by his deathe deserued life for mee and al the world, not for himselfe, but for vs, according to the saying of Peter. He bare our sinnes in his bodie. And therefore, sith Christ by his ful obedience hath deserued lyfe, my desert in him is life. And therefore will I dare to go vnto my Lord and my God, for I am sure of mercie.
            
            
               Sat.
               I am the prince of darknesse, and al sinners belong to my kingdome. For the reward of sinne is death, and therefore assure not thy selfe of mercye, for that is in vaine.
            
            
               Con.
               Auoid Satan: For what though thou bee the prince of

darkenesse, yet doo I set thee at naught. I am a sinner, but what of that Satan? my sinnes haue lost their stinge, and so mayest thou gape for a prey, and goe without a reward. For in the bloud of Iesus Christ am I purged from my sinnes, yea from all my sinnes, the sinnes of my childhood, my youth, my olde age, commytted in thought, worde, or deede: whatsoeuer they haue bene, are, or shal be, they are drowned in the bottom of the sea, and so couered in mercie, that the Lorde will neuer remember them.
            
            
               Sat.
               Thou liest conscience. For the Lord is iust, and therefore hee will remember them, that he may punish them.
            
            
               
               Con.
               The Lord is righteous, thou fowle diuel: iust, and true are all his waies, but yet thou lyest in thy consequent, for it standeth not with his iustice, to remember our sinnes, that hee may punish vs, whose sins he hath punished in his sonne Christ. Christe Iesus, by his death hath deliuered vs out of debt to the wrath of his heauenlie Father, and purchased vs remission of sins. And therefore I am sure that as God is iust: so he will not remember my sinnes to punishe them in me againe, sith his sonne hath paid his debt for mee. For it is againste iustice, that any debt should be twise paid, or twyse required.
            
            
               
               Sat.
               Though Christ once died, to saue thee from sinne: yet haue I thine euill life to laie against thee, for the which thou art and shalt be mine.
            
            
               Con.
               Christ indeede died to saue me, and by his own death hath he fully bought mee from the wrath of his Father. And I confes Satan, to my Lord, that I haue not liued after his lawe, but manie waies transgressed his holye will: but what then thou foule spirit, am I thine? no Satan no. For the Lorde hath mercy in store for euery Publican when he craueth it, be he neuer so ill a liuer. He is at this point with vs, Aske and haue. I will therefore aske mercie of God, who gaue his owne son,

by his bloudie Death to saue mee: and I am sure that I shall haue my sute. For he hath spoken it, and can not lie. Thou liest therefore for I am not thine. But thou sayest that I am, and shal be thine. Auoyd Satan, auoid like a coward. For he that is with mee hath broozed thy head, euen the mightie Lion of the tribe of Iudah, that hath promised to be with his church euen til the end of the worlde: he is with me, and if he be with mee whoe can be against me? doo not therefore crake of this Satan, that I am an euill liuer, and therefore thine. Giue ouer thy combat, for if thou doo not I will call vppon my Capteine Michael, by the power of his

Angelike bande to dashe thee out of countenance, whoe did beate thee in Heauen, and all thy hellish armie.
            
            
               The cal of Conscience in conflict for succour against present danger.
               THe diuel, O Lorde, like a rauenous lion dooth seeke to teare the lambe of thy Pasture; and vnlesse thou helpest there is none other waie, but to the slaughterhouse, It hath beene a continuall practyse of his, euen from the beginning, to rob thy childrē of the riches of their redemption, wrought & accomplished by the bloud shed of thy beloued sonne.
               He someth like a bore of the

desert, and seeketh by violence to breake into the vineyard of my soule, which thy handes O thou heauenlie husbandman, haue planted. Vp therefore and arise O gratious god and good shepheard of my soule. And as thou hast promised, so be thou with mee in time of this my skirmishe, that I may giue Satan the foile, and sleepe fafelie vnder the wings of thy mercy, with whom is store of mercie. To thee be al glorie both now and euer, Amen.
            
         
         
            
            The dead mans Schoole: Wherein Death teacheth all Estates and degrees, from the Prince to the begger, many notable lessons, most necessarie to be learned: made by the sayd E. H.
            
               APproche ye sonnes of Adam, you that are as I was: and shall bee as I am. Drawe neere and learne those thinges diligentlie, wherein I shal instruct you.
            First I would haue you to

learne this lesson, that as sinne, came in by Adam, so by sinne death as a due reward followed. And therefore, when you looke vppon mee, remember whence you are falne in adam from grace into sinne, from sin into death: and therevpon sorowe for your sinnes, and prepare your selues to death. For it is the waie of all flesh.
            There is a time to bee borne in sinne, and a time to die for the same: al flesh is grasse, yee muste all wither and fade with the flower. This natural death which foloweth the combat of the Elementes and sinne, shal creep vpon your mortallims: for as the sunne hath an east to rise in, so he hath a West to fal

in: euen 
                  •
               o you shall all dance with me one day, and this day is vncertaine, noe man knoweth when it shall come. For it shall come at vnawares vpon you, and therefore doe good, and eschew euil, sin not, least a woorse thing than this naturall death doe happen vnto you. For if you doo still wallowe in sin, answer me, What if death suddenlye strike you with his dart as hee dooth manie men: howe woulde you bee able to stand in ye iudgement of God?
            Therefore leaue off in time, and liue lyke Christyans, that GOD yet at the least, seeing your liues are so wicked, may find a good will and purpose in you towardes a godlie conuersation.

Do we not stil hold the same pace like old carthorses, but repent and amend, for the kingdome of God is at hand.
            Secondly, when you see mee remember the spirituall death of Adam, wherein you are all wrapped, by nature borne in sin & children of wrath. Dead you are in Adam, starke dead in your sinnes, vntill the Lord do regenerate you anew with his holie spirit, and water your barren nature with the drops of his grace.
            And herein see that you doo acknowledge your weakenes, or rather your miserie: that by sinne you are dead, euen without life by nature, and without anye power to attayne vnto

life, as I am and shall be, vntill the Lorde doo knocke at my bed and raise mee from death to life, to liue with him for euer.
            Auoyde sinne therefore, as your deadlie enimie, whiche would rob you of life, and fetter you in bandes of eternall death; and crie vnto the Lord for helpe. For withoute him, against this enimie, you can do nothing. Crie with the prophet Dauid, Create, O Lord, a new heart, and renewe a right spirite within vs, that beeing quickened againe by the dew of his blessing, and strengthened with the armour of grace, you may be able to withstand the furie of Sathan, and constantly

to endure the battell of a raging conscience.
            Thirdlie, when you looke vpon mee, remember whereof you are, euen of earth: no better than duste and ashes, to the which I nowe returne. And therefore to the loftie minded manne I say; Dust and ashes, why art thou proud? for earth thou art, & to earth thou shalt, and become a prey for knawing wormes.
            Decke thy bodye neuer so gloriouslie, tie Iewels aboute thy neck, lade thy fingers with ringes, sit at thine ouerrunning tables and make merrie, despise al men: yet I tell thee, thou art dust, as I am, so shalte thou be.
            
               
Thy bodie shal stinke, which nowe thou embaulmest: thy lofty looke shal bee humbled, the wormes shall feede vppon thee. Looke vpon me, & thinke vpon thy selfe, be not as thou art: but thinke vpon mee, and what thou shalt be, and folow him that is able of dust to raise thee to life, & crieth vnto thee: Be humble and meeke, as I am
            If thou refuse this exhortation, remember that pride shall haue a fall: that earth is heauy by nature, and falleth: that he that exalteth himselfe shall be humbled, and hee that humbleth himselfe shal be exalted.
            Acknowledge therefore that earth is thy mother, which is the basest of al other elements

and folowe Christ thy maister, and onlie guide to his father in ioy: that out of earth hee may raise thee to heauen: and after thy resurrection, for thine earthie and stinking bodie, giue thee a glorious and immortall bodie that thou mayest shine with him like a starre in the kingdome of glory.
            Fourthly, let all couetous persons looke vpon mee, and amend their euill liues. For as I came naked into this world, so did they: and as I carrye nothinge with mee but my winding sheete, euen so shall they. Their riches, the pelfe of this world shall they leaue behind them, which they haue gathered in paine, and hourded vp

with greedie minds.
            Oh you hungrie lions! you are alwaies gaping for ye prey, you are euer hungrie, and neuer satisfied: get you neuer so much by hooke or by crook, by violent iniurie, or biting vsurie. But looke you vpon me. For an eln of earth now shall serue mee, and so must it serue you, whom nothing may suffice in this world.
            Sorrowe therefore, and amende in time. For you were not borne to gather worldelye substance: but to serue poore Iesus, who of God made himselfe poore to enrich you. You were not borne to continue in this world.
            No, you haue no continuing

citie heere, but you must looke for another, euen Heauen, whence you are nowe exiled: and therefore you must seeke the things that be aboue. Your conuersation must be in Heauen.
            You must not tie your harts to the earth, and hourd vp the pelfe of this world, lest the verie moths and rust of your tresure cry for a plague vpon and against you in the daie of vengeance. For die you muste one day, and be as I am, and so rest in the bellye of mother earth, vntil the day of accoūts, when God shal rewarde euerie man according to his deserts.
            Fifthlie, let all enuious persons, and euil willers beholde

my hart: let all bloodshedders looke vpon my feete, all backbiters, slanderers and curssers, marke my toong: all robbers and Vsurers view my handes: all couetous persons note my winding sheete: all selfelouers and proud men gaze vpon my face and hollowe eies, let all men looke vpon me & amende their liues, for as I am, euen so shall they be.
            Sixtly, let al Christians look vpon me, courtiers and countrey men, highe and lowe, rich and poore, yoong and old, noble and vnnoble: all, let them looke vpon mee, and remember their end Die they shal al: this 
                  〈…〉
               l remember, that they may neuer sinne.
            
               
Let all swearing belly gods, al selfelouers, men or women, that monstrously disguise chast nature, and paint their bodies, which are stinking toombes of their seelie soules, with intollerable vanities, let al that care for beawties hewe looke vpon mee, and iudge of theyr owne vanitie, and condemne themselues, least they be iudged of the Lord.
            For their broydered hayre, their faced and defaced apparell, theyr superfluous lasings, their sumptuous Veluetes and silks, their golden caules, their wrought clothes, their ringed fingers, and their costlie fare in this worlde, which Lazarus wanteth, they are all vanitie,

neither shal they redeem them but to earth they shall, and vanish with the vapour.
            They shal al sleepe with me, and they shall be one daye no better than I am: worms meat, stinking carcases, duste and ashes they shall be, whatsoeuer they doo appeare to the foolish world.
            Kinges and princes, magistrates and subiects, schollers and maisters, rich and poore, al may looke vpon me. For I am able to teache them a lesson, which they forget dailie: That earth they are, and vnto earth they must with mee one daie, and noe man knoweth howe soone. Disdaine not to learne this at me: for I teach you the

truth, which one day you your selues shal approue to be very true.
            Seuenthly, let all mourning mothers & sorrowing friends, lette them giue ouer weeping and vnchrystian wailinge. For that cannot helpe them, because it grudgeth and complai neth againste the will of God: but rather let them bee merrie and reioise.
            For behold, this life is a warfare, euen a continual warfare, as Iob calleth it, and death is a sleepe, a sweete sleepe, so that by it I rest from my labours, I am deliuered from daunger to safetye, from labour to ioye, from trauel to rest, from paine to pleasure, and lie in the earth

as it were in a bed, till I must rise to iudgement.
            This is the lucky estate of them that are dead in the lord. And therfore did father Simeon desire to departe in peace: and Paule counted hymselfe a wretch because hee was not deliuered from this bodye of sinne.
            So that you haue no cause to mourne for your friends, whoe by deathe are passed beyonde death: euen to life, to liue with GOD, and to see him face to face, euen as hee is. But rather you haue cause to reioyse, because by death they are taken into ioye, to be where Christe Iesus is.
            The dead man is but a sleepe,

hee is not dead but for a time, and at length he shall awake, euen by the sounde of a trumpet and crie of an Archangell, to see his redeemer in heauen, where he with thee and thou with him, and the Heauenlye armie of Angels & saints mailiue for euer.
            Looke vpon me, and remember this, al you that mourne for the death of your friendes. For blessed am I, and thrise blessed. This worlde is an exile, Heauen my naturall countrey: and so by death I am deliuered frō exile, and heerein I am verie happie.
            This present worlde is euill, in heauen are ioyes that passe sense and conceit. And so by

death in the Lorde I am freed from euil, and placed in ioye: and heerin I am happie.
            This world is no continuing citie, but another, that is heauen, which when I liued, in faith I looked for: so that by death I am set in a permanent place, and heerein am I happy.
            This life is a pilgrimage, hea uen my home: and so by death of a pilgrim, I am made a citizen, and heerein I am happy.
            To conclude, by death, from earth to heauen, from men to Angels, from warre to peace, from paine to pleasure, from griefe to euerlasting gladnes, from vanitie & miserie to perpetuall felicitie I haue passed in peace: & herin I am happie.

So that death is not to bee feared, nor yet to bee lamented: but rather welcome in ioye of spirit whensoeuer it commeth.
            And for this are al Christians bound to render hartie thanks vnto the Lorde, that hath turned the cursse into a blessinge, and by his pretious death vpon the crosse made death no deth but an entrie to life, a passage to ioy, a deliuery from miserie. For this blessing, blessed be the name of the Lorde, and let al people say, Amen.
            Imprint these few lessons in your memoryes, and engraue them in the tables of your harts. And thus farwel.
         
         
            
            A Lodge for Lazarus. Wherein the poore and friendlesse are exceedinglie comforted in spirit against all kinde of calamities incident to this temporall and miserable life: made by the sayd E. H.
            
               THere are two sorts of pilgrimes in the worlde, some are rich, and some are pore. Though the earth be the Lordes, and the riches thereof his owne possessions, though al men be his subiects, & haue

deserued the like condition of life: yet to blase his mercy and to open his iudgementes and iustice vnto the world, it hath pleased him to blesse som with store of his goodnes, and to punish others with the wante of his temporall blessings.
            Thus with pouertie he beateth the poore to declare his iudgement against sinne: and the ritch man hee storeth with aboundance to the manifestation of his vndeserued mercie. By these his benefits vpon the ritche, and these his scourges laid vpon the poore, hee crieth out to them: Sinne no more, alluring the one partie by faire and gentle, the other by sharp and bitter meanes vnto safe

repentance.
            The rich man he maketh his deputies on earth, or rather the stewards of his familie, or rather the paterns of his mercie, to take pitie vpon the begger, when he craueth reliefe: euen as he hath taken cōpassion vpon them, who neuer deserued it. And that they may vse them selues as shewers of his mercy hee hath promised that they shal alwaies haue ye poore with them: this we see at this daye.
            What a band of beggers be in euery place? the poore doo swarme in euerye corner, the fatherles and widowes, yoong and old, of all ages infinite doo grone and crie for very neede. Som want cloth to couer their

naked bodies, some haue not meate to mittigate their hunger, some noe drinke to ease their thirst, some lie vnder hed ges in steed of lodginges, some are lame and cannot go, some are blind and cannot see, some are deafe and cannot heare, some are dumbe and cannot speake, some are sicke, some are sore, of all people to the iudgement of the worlde most miserable: and therefore doo they seeme to make this complaint to God our Heauenlye father.
            O Lorde thou hast created vs, thou hast framed vs: we are thy handiworke, and thou the potter, that madest our grandfather Adam of the moulde of

the earth. Was thy goodnesse such to make vs when we wer not gentle Lord, and wilt thou beate vs nowe thou hast made vs? O Lord, where is thy mercie? is the eie of thy pitty dim med? are the eares of thy woon ted goodnesse sealed? what Lord? is the hand of thy fauor shortened? is the riuer of thy goodnesse dried vp?
            Shal we hunger? nay, shall wee hungerstarue for want of thy blessinges? what now, good Lord? thy sonne taught vs to praie, Our Father, Are we thy children, and thou our Father? Oh! where is thy fatherlie prouidence? for beholde, O piteous Lord, we are borne to nothing: besides, skin, flesh, and

bones, we haue nothing in this world.
            We post from place to place, & run from towne to towne, wee goe from house to house, we cry for releefe in thy name, we aske it for thy sake: but alas good Lorde, wee can get nothing. If we be strong though wee haue charge of children, we are whipped, we are stocked, wee are imprisoned, and howe not abused? if wee bee lame, dum, deafe, sicke or sore, we may cry: but alas, charity is frozen, where one heareth hundreds doo stop their eares, and are deafe at our sutes.
            O Lord, charitie is drowned, the best friend which we shuld haue: hard hearts doo reigne,

the stoutest enimy that we can haue: with this enimie we are assaulted almost in euery place alas for pitty! pitty, sweet lord is our request, haue mercy vpon vs. Looke vppon Lazarus our king and capteine: behold Lord, he commeth to the rich mans gate, there he lieth, there he crieth; Crums, crummes he craueth to ease his hunger, but he cannot get them, dogs haue them, but Lazarus cānot haue them.
            The dogs come to Lazarus and licke his sores: but Diues hath no feete to carrie him, no tongue to laie the playster of comfort to his earnest sute, no hand to helpe him, not a crum to feede him. Beholde Lorde,

doggs are better vnto vs than Diues: nay, they are in better case than we are; for they haue the crums that falles from their maisters table: but alas! Lazarus cannot come by them.
            O Lorde, now where is thy wonted mercie? shall Lazarus want? shal he want the crums of breade to ease his hunger? what? shal he crie for them, & shal hee not haue them? shall he shout, but shall hee not bee heard? what good Lorde? shal hee die for hunger, and Diues walowe in pleasure?
            What Lord? hast thou loste thy name god, which soundeth as much as good? thou art called Deus, quasi Dans, and yet shall Lazarus wante bread to

refresh him? This complaint of the poore man dooth gnawe him: nay, sometimes it quyte deuoureth him.
            But to lay a salue of comfort to this sore of Lazarus: O Lazarus, why doest thou weepe? why doest thou crie out? whie doest thou seeme to blame the Lorde, he hath appointed Diues as a father to regard thee.
            But what, dooest thou come to his gate, dooest thou craue charitie, art thou denied it? the Lord commanded it, & therefore is the Lord instified, when he is iudged. But Diues hath abused his benefits, and therefore shal he answer for it.
            Let this be thy cōmfort: let this be thy lodge to reste in,

from all complaints, that one daie God, who is charitie, shal iudge the worlde, the greatest scourge that Diues shall haue. Then shall hee say, as accounting that not doone vnto him, which was not doon vnto you. when I was hungrye, thou gauest me no meate, noe not the crums that fell from thy table: when I was thirstie, thou gauest me no drink: when I was naked, thou didst not cloath me; when I was in prison thou didst not comfort me; when I was harbourles, thou didst not lodge mee; giue an accoumpt of thy stewardship. Then shal he crie out, that hee neuer saw him hungrie or thirstie, or else he would haue refreshed him:

not imprisoned, or else hee would haue visited him: not lodgles, or else he would haue harboured him.
            But this is all lies, and therefore will he say vnto him: Nescio, I know thee not: Departe as cursed into euerlasting fire, where shall bee weeping and gnashing ofteeth.
            Come hither crieng Lazarus, thou that criest and showtest out vppon the Lorde, and vpon the tyrannie of worldelings: art thou sicke? art thou sore? art thou deafe? art thou dumbe? art thou naked? what? hast thou no place to laie thy head in? come hither, for here are pallaces of pleasure to pastime in, excellente turrets of

ioy to banket in, and lodgelesse of infinit comfort to harbor in. For what? haue you not hadd meate, when you haue craued it? or drinke when you haue asked it? haue you beene in prison, and not visited? sicke & not comforted? sore & not eased? naked and not cloathed? wanderers and not succored?
            Behold, in your behalf Christ will iudge the rich and mercilesse gluttons of this worlde: and in the daye of reuelation, you to your ioyous conquest, and to their vtter shame shall testifie & beare witnes against them. This is the first lodge of comfort.
            But yet there is another besides this: enter into that. Behold,

when you asked reliefe, it was Christ that asked and was denied, so that in this worlde you beare an image of Christ, who came vnto his owne, and yet was not receiued, noe not knowne: who had not his nest, as the birdes of the aire haue: nor his den to flie vnto, as the foxes haue: no not so much as a place to lay his hed on.
            Hee sought once to harbour in Peters ship vpon a pillowe: but marke, how the waues the winds disquieted the shippe, it frighteth Peter, poore Iesus is pinched at and awakened, so that hee could not haue a good nap to comfort his wearinesse in his harbouring place. Was this the estate of the mayster?

then rest in peace, and harbor in ioye. For the scholler is not aboue his maister.
            Naie, dooth the tyrannie of Diues pinch him, when it pincheth you? dooth hee hunger, when you hunger? dooth hee thirst, when you thirst? is he na ked, when you are naked? is he sicke when you are sicke? is he sore when you are sore? is he harbourlesse when you bee lodgles? what? dooth he smart when you smart, dooth he crie for almes, when you craue: is it he that made you, he that saued you, he that spent his life and shedde his owne pretious bloud to redeeme you from satan, & yet wil you complaine? let it not be so, but in patience

leane vnto the louing Lorde, and let him be a pallace of ioy to lodge and rest in.
            There is a thirde lodge of comfort for al Lazars. For the vncharitable dealing of Diues shal be his vtter ruine. If Diues haue shut his eare against thy cry, and denied to relieue thee in time of needie extreamity: if he haue not opened his hart to pitie thee, nor stretched out his arme to rayse thee, when thou art faln into mysery: hen woe, woe: a rod is at hande to beate him: O foole, this night the diuel shall fetche thy soule from thee. Heere is a glorious lodge of comfort for al Lazers
            If Diues haue his barnes filled with corne, his chests with

treasure, his table furnished with plenty of meat, if he haue al things at will: yet shall nothing redeeme him from miserie, if he will not attend the piteous crie of Lazarus in tyme of extreame necessitie. For hee that will not heare the poore when he dooth crie: when hee crieth himselfe, the Lorde will him denie.
            Hath Diues now denied you almes? then wil the Lorde denie him mercie: wil the Lorde denie him mercie, because he hath not pitied your myserie? hath the Lorde such care ouer your estate, that hee will reuenge it sharpely if you be not cherished: and will you yet complaine? Fie, no, for shame,

but let this be a lodge for you to rest in.
            God is your gard, howsoeuer it go with you: you are his little ones, his dearlinges, and deerely beloued. If Diues doo abuse you, if he doo not cherish you: beholde howe he loueth you, for Diues for your sake shall suffer paines for euer.
            You want foode on earth: but he shall want the bread of life in hell. You want drinke, but he shal want euen a drop of water in hel to coole his flaming toong. You wante in this world cloth to couer your nakednes: but hee shall want the white raiment of innocencie: and therefore wallowe in myserie for euer: You wante

lodging here, but he shal want the lodge of ioyes else-where. You cannot be his ghest, but a worme for your sakes shall bee his ghest euerlastingly.
            Hee had store of all thinges: what wanted hee? neyther siluer nor golde to haue enriched you, nor meate to haue fedde you, nor drinke to haue eased you: he had cloth to haue couered you, crums of his table that would haue releeued you, he hadde lodges wherein hee might haue graunted you harbours.
            But see the iudgementes of God for your sakes. This Diues is not worth a drop of water in hel: for al his pleasure he reapeth lasting paine, for his

melodious harmonie, he heareth howling & weeping, and gnashing of teeth. This is the wo that they shal swim in, that with Diues neglect the crie of seely Lazarus.
            But yet view a fourth lodge of comfort, a princelie lodge, you band of beggers: approch and looke vp, what? was Lazarus clothed in sores? did no man visit or comfort him? had he no physitian either by word or by worke to cure him? had he noe surgerie, but onelye by dogs?
            Nay, what? was he not only sore in bodie, but pinched in stomach? did he want food? naye, did he so hunger, that he desired crummes of breade to

please the crie of his greedye stomach, and yet could he not get it?
            What? are any of you in the same case? beholde a lodge of comfort: looke vppe, and there you shal see Abrahams bosom and Lazarus therein lodged. See, he that wallowed in sores & might haue washed in tears such was his miserie to the eye of the world.
            Beholde, hee that was not worth a crum of breade in this worlde, hee that had no lodge place to rest in, nowe lodgeth in Abrahams bosome, an harborough of rest.
            What nowe you beggers, you that wander from place to place, and haue no resting

place to staie in: nay, you that wander, and for want of charitie doo alwaies hunger: be patient, blesse God in your aduersitie, and reste in the lodge of Lazarus.
            Diues was aboue Lazarus in this world: Diues waded in plentie, but Lazarus in pouertie: Diues sate at his table, Lazarus at the gates: Diues healthie Lazarus sick; Diues with a fulbellye, but Lazarus lyued with an hungrie stomach: and yet looke vp, and now you shal see Diues below, and Lazarus aboue him.
            Diues in this world had rich men for his comates, gentiles and potentates for his ghestes: but now he kepeth companie

with the diuell and his angels. Lazarus in this worlde had no companie to comfort him: nay, he had none that alwaies tarried with him, but sicknesse and pouertie: they were from time to time his two ghests, & at Diues his gates the dogs too did visit and licke him.
            But now behold, Diues byteth the bread of misery in hel: but Lazarus lodgeth in Abrahams bosom, and now in heauen banketteth at the table of euerduring ioye, with the patriarches, Prophets, Apostles Martyres, and holie ones of God.
            Oh! wil the impatient Lazarus saie: this is a heauie case, to be alwaies beaten with pinching

pouertie, alwaies to bite of sorrowe, and neuer to liue at ease.
            Surelie if this be thy case, as thou monest: yet I saie, looke vp to the lodge of reste, euen Abrahams bosom: for though thou doo swim in seas of extremitie, yet thou dooest banquet with Lazarus, who euen in this worlde did suffer pinching extremitie, and yet now he dooth rest in peace.
            But thou art beaten, thou saiest: thou art buffeted: so was Lazarus. Oh! but thou art beaten sore, so was he. But yet thou singest on the same song: thou art beaten.
            Art thou beaten? then lodge in comfort. For better it is to

be beaten with Lazarus, than damned with Diues: it is better to be crossed, than not crow ned: it is better to bee beaten, than neuer to be chastised. For God receiueth no childe, but whom he scourgeth.
            But yet thou criest: Oh my life is miserable! is it myserable: then lodge in comforte. For miserie is the high waie to felicity.
            Thou muste bee buffeted, if thou wilt be saued: for he that will liue godlie in Christ Iesus must suffer persecutions. I am the waie sayth hee. But what was his waie to Heauen? A crosse was his waie vnto the crowne, and thus woulde hee lead thee to immortal glorie.
            
               
What saiest thou nowe, Lazarus? hast thou anie thing to complaine of? I hope these lodges of comforte doo please thee. But if they doo not, yet harken a little.
            Is thy life a castle of misery, because thou art wrapt in pouertie? art thou a wretch of this world, because thou art cloathed in sores? dooest thou sing of nothing but calamitye, because health faileth thee, or store of temporall blessinges? why then reason with me.
            What if thou hadst the riches of Diues, his health, his wealth his garners, his treasure, hys lands, his cattell? yet vanitie of vanites, crieth the Preacher, and al is vanitie.
            
               
Vanitie? what, Vanitie of vanities? nay, what? is all vanitie? ritches, health, treasure, pleasure, wealth: is all woe? nay, is al vanitie? vanitie, what? worth a nit? naye, worth nothing: and yet art thou troubled?
            The rich men of this world doe fall into manie temptations, in so much that wher they shoulde bee gods on earth, to helpe and to aide the needye, when neede requireth: they prooue themselues cages of vn cleane diuels.
            Some lords of landes do begger their poore tenantes, they racke and impouerish them to better their owne estate: some hourde vppe corne for deere

times, to the vtter beggering of the poor, some haue catching hands, who though they haue enough, yet are alwaies catching and snatching at the widowes mite.
            Vsurers or rather robbers, who haue inough but the rich? who want it but the poor? whie want they it, but because charitie is deade, and the rich are snared in deadly temptations? But yet they will be riche, they scrape and trauel for goods.
            But what crie the proud and the rich men in the fift of wisedome? Oh say they, what hath pride profited vs? or what hath the pompe of riches broughte vs?
            Come hither Lazarus, art

thou poore? desire not to bee rich: for this is the vsuall song of such as are rich in this world Oh! what hath the pompe of riches brought vs? doo not riches better a man? nay, dooth not the pompe of riches bring any commodity with it.
            What? can it not deliuer vs from dansing with death, from the gnawing worme, from the bed of earth? no though wee were as beautifull as Absolon, as long liued as Methuselah, as eloquent as Cicero, as subtile as Aristotle: to end, as riche as Cresus, yet we must needs become wormes meate, & turne to dust and ashes,
            How now Lazarus? what if thou hadst courtlye palaces to

lodge in? excessiue plentie of al thinges? euen the pompe of riches? what should they auail thee? nothing: yea nothing, and yet is pouertie a burthen vnto thee?
            It is the will of God Lazar that thou shouldest be a Lazarus: and it is thy dailie praier, that his wil be doone: and it is his will to saue all men. But what? is it his will, that thou shouldest bee poore? and art thou not merrie?
            It is his wil to saue thee? nay, is it he that can only saue thee? nay, is he woont to saue vs by crossinge vs, that wee shoulde enter into heauen by manie tribulations: and wilte thou not yet lodge in comfort?
            
               
Nay what? doest thou praie that the wil of God be doone? if thou praie for it, as it standeth thee vpon, so thou dooest wish it. Now his will is to beat thee with pouertie: thou praiest for it, thou wishest it. What now? dooest thou wish it? and yet art thou sad and pensiue?
            Men are woont to ioye, yea and to reioyse when they haue their wishe? but thou hast it: and wilte thou bee sorie? The Lord saith, nay the Lord sweateth it, that He wil not the deth of a sinner: and death is the due wages of thy sinnes, the which of iustice he might paie vnto thee, but hee will not of mercie.
            Wil he not thy death, which

is due vnto thee? and yet doost thou complaine of pouertye, which is his will to laie vppon thee? let this bee thy lodge of comfort, that his mercie is our safetie: and that his will is nothinge else but his mercie: yea, though hee doo beat and buffet vs neuer so much.
            And to perswade vs in this point, who are so incredulous of nature from time to time, it hathe pleased him to scourge his children, or rather to scour the vessels of their heartes, the lodge place of his holy spirite, from the dregs of iniquity.
            Caine was an heire, he possessed al, hee was the childe of this world: but Abel the child of God, hee had his name of

vanitie, his end was to be mur thered, he receiued his deaths wound, euen by hi

               wne brother.
            Looke vpon the whole colledge of Saints, and wee shall see some imprisoned with Ieremie, some be headded with Baptist, some stoned with Steuen, som crucified with Christ Iesus, lapped in lothsom sores, wrapt in bands of vtter extremitie with poore Lazarus: notwithstanding Diues the world ling wallowe in all health and wealth.
            How nowe Lazarus? looke vpon thy brethren, & be thou comforted: yea if thou haste been rich, euen as riche as Iob, if thou hast sat on the pinnacle

of pleasure, and mounted vpp with the highest trees: if thou haste flourished like the glorious lillie, and yet vppon a sudden wither awaie: if thou hast fallen from the top to the foore of a hil, that is, from prosperitie to aduersitie, and become a bare Iob, yet beholde the pallace of comfort: I am sure, that my redeemer liueth, and that with these eies I shall see him, saith Iob.
            Whoe was this Iob? a riche man he was, he had plentie of al thinges. GOD had blessed him with children, and vpon a sudden all is gone, Oxen, Camels, children and al. His own friendes doo forsake him, hee wadeth in wo and sicknes: and

yet these clubs can not batter him downe, but stil he climeth to the lodge of comforte, saying: I am sure that my redeemer liueth, and that with these eies I shall see him.
            What though this earthye masse our body, this dustie tabernacle bestormed and tossed with the winter blastes of this world: what thoughe our bellies feel the gnawing worm of a plaining stomach, & our backes want cloth to couer it: yet is heere a lodge of comfort, which by faith wee must take possession of, euerye one sayeng with father Iob: I am sure that my redeemer liueth: and that with these eies I shall see him.
            
               
Though God scourge mee, yet as a father to correct mee, & not as a iudge to condemne me: for I am sure that my redemer liueth, & that with these eies I shall see him. Though I do heer want bread to quench the crie of hunger, and drinke to coole the heate of my burning stomach: though I haue neither cloth to apparell mee: nor friend to comfort me, nor place to lodge in, yet beholde, I am sure that my redeemer liueth, and that with these eies I shall see him.
            If thou be a spirituall Lazar, and wantest the crums of com fort, if the diuell lay thine own sinnes before thee, to the ende thou mayest eat with him, the

bread of desperation: yet run to the lodge of comforte, and there sing thou in spight of thy sinnes, of Satan and al his hellish hounds: I am sure that my redeemer liueth, and that with these eies I shall see him.
            In this lodge of comfort S. Iohn dooth finger out to thy hungrie soule the food of life, saieng, beholde the lambe of God that hath taken awaie the sinnes of the world. But what? was this lambe crucified? dyd he not die? yes, and rose the thirde day a conquerour ouer sinne, death, hel, the diuel and al his angels.
            But yet perchanse thou wilt not beleeue it: if thou doe not, come hyther Thomas, sayeth

Christ, and thrust in thy finger Dooest thou not beleeue it? then come hither and trie, trie and then truste. This side of Christ is the sole lodge of rest for all spirituall Lazars, that hunger and thirste after theyr saluation.
            Marie Magdalen, that was possessed with so many diuels: Peter that had once, twise, yea the third time denied his maister Christ: yea the theefe on the crosse by faith leapte into this side of safetie, and lodge of Christ Iesus.
            This lodge is his wounds, which hee had on the crosse to heale vs: which woundes alwaies are open, for al st
                  〈…〉
               ng Thomasses to harbour and to

lodge in. For at what time soeuer a sinner wil repent him of his sinnes, I will blot al his sins out of my remembrance, saith the Lord.
            Here is a lodge for al Lazars, that grone in spirit. All such as are heauie and laden, & heare and follow that proclamation of Baptist, Repent: al that with father Dauid weepe, & learne to wet the couch of their harts with the tears of their groning soules.
            This lodge of comfort is open to all, it is denied to none that repent, haue they beene neuer so greuous sinners.
            Besides these two sortes of Lazars, there are some that are rich in temporal blessings, and

yet very Lazars in grace: couetous men and vsurers, they doo not onelie want that they haue, but by euer seeking more and more, they drowne theyr seelie soules in sinne, and for a lodge of comfort, they harbour in hellish Aegypt.
            Thus was Diues the glutton a Lazar: hee had plentie of all things, and yet hee was not so riche in grace as to bestowe a crum of bread vpon Lazarus: and therefore dooth hee nowe thirst for a drop of water, and cannot get it, to ease the furye of his tormenting toong.
            Diues is the ringleader of the dance to al carelesse ritch men that haue departed this life, as couetous wretches. But vnto

them that are yet aliue, although they haue been a long time disciples of Diues, yet are the woundes of Iesus Christ open to lodge them, against the stormes of a frowning conscience.
            Yea, it is open for al sinners, who are Lazars by nature, and want the verie crums of goodnes: they gape to receiue vs, and they are alwaies fresh and greene. Loe a fountaine of Christs pretious and outstreaming blood, wherein al that repent are washed from their leprosie, and deliuered from the sting of iniquitie for euer.
            In the worlde there is nothing but miserie, it is nothing but a kingdome of calamitie:

and the wounds of Christ are a lodge of al rest, where ther is no paine, no sorrow, no vexation, no trouble, but all ioye, euen such ioy as passeth al con ceipt, to the which the Lord of his mercy bring vs al, Amen.
         
         
            
            
            A retrait from sinne: Wherein is sounded, as with a shrill trumpet in the eares of all men, what damnable daungers depend vpon continuance in sin, neglect of repentance, abuse of the acceptable time of grace: and other excellent meanes daily mouing men to the amendment of their finneful life: made by the sayd E. H.
            
               COnsidering with my selfe the frailetie of man, and the dangerous trappes of Satan, which he hath laid in euerie corner of this wicked

worlde, to catch vs: his craftie deuises which he worketh con tinuallye to snare vs, and the drowsines of man, as carelesse to auoid them, I thought good to make this base retrait from sinne, that beeing called from straieng, we might come vnto the true sheepefold, and so bee saued.
            And here I might begin with wondering at the churlish nature of man, who being so often called by the voice of God and his deputies, from sinne: doth yet notwithstanding walow therein, like swine in filth and mire.
            Duste and ashes! shall the Lord himselfe crie vpon thee? Sinne not: and wilte thou not

heare him? if not sinning bee thy soules safetie: wilt thou be so vnmindfull of thy selfe, as to suffer thy gratious lord to haue the repulse?
            Shal the king command his subiect, and bee obeyed: and the king of glorie commaund thee not to sinne, and not bee obeied? shal the good and trustie subiect be so dutiful to the king, who is yet but duste and ashes: and wilt thou shew thy self so rebellious against God, who is the God of comfort, & father of mercie?
            O thou drowsie creature! awake, bee wise. Consider if God being wisedome, doo cal thee from sinne, then is it follie to follow sinne. If God being

the father of mercie, doo cal thee from sinne the mother of endles misery, then ô wretched creature returne, repent, least for mercie thou doo reap the rewarde of sinne, which is death eternal.
            But why should wee by sinning make our selues thrall to so tyrannous a maister as Satan? and despise the cal of so lo uing a Sauiour as Iesus Christ, crieng vnto vs, Sinne not.
            The seruice of Satan is miserable bondage: the seruice of Iesus Christe is a blessed libertie, it is a freedome, that passeth al freedomes: and so much the rather to be embraced, as the other is myserable and to be detested: yea, it is with both

hands to bee receiued, forsomuch as our Lord Iesus Christ in commanding requireth it.
            For being bondslaues of Satan, so vile a varlot, shall the Lord offer vs his seruice, which is perfect libertie, and shall we refuse it, and not rather receue it? Eue did so muche as obeie the lieng serpent in paradise, & shal we denie obedience to Iesus Christ? she obeied to sin, but her obedience wroght hir miserie? and shal not we obey the Lord, that our ende maye be felicitie?
            For how can wee, deseruing eternall miserie, bee accepted to blisse, if that by disobedience we prouoke to wrath the onelie purchaser of mercie? I

saie therfore, where Christ crieth, Sinne not, obeie him, and kisse the sonne least hee be angrie: kisse him, and obey him; for if he be but a little angrie, blest are all they that put their trust in him.
            But to make this retraite to sounde more shrill in the eares of slumbring Adam: looke vpon the damned spirit of Diues, he burneth in hel: but whye if not for sinne? His toong flameth, neyther can hee get a droppe of water to quench it: and why but for sin? The fire that hee burneth in is vnquenchable: his dolefull musicke is gnashing of teethe, howlinge, weeping, and great lamentation: his case is curssed for euer,

and why but for sinne?
            If Diues had knowne, that the seruice of the Lorde hadde beene perfect libertie, and that obedience to his commandements had beene the pathway to heauen, or that his sinful life would haue wrought him such a web of wo, or rewarded him with death for his wages in seruing Satan: no doubte hee would haue followed as good counsell, as hee wished by the dead to be reuealed to his brethren: that is, he woulde haue sought grace of the Lord, that hee might haue obeied him in holines, and so be saued.
            But marke ô yee liuing, and learne of the dead. Diues was a sinner, he serued sinne, and

the old serpent, but his seruice wrought his wo, euen a wo eternal. Now what a tirannous maister is that, that so rewardeth his seruant? or what a miserable seruaunt is that, which reapeth nothing by his seruice but wo?
            But O thrise miserable are we! if we will serue the same maister, whose seruice in Diues wee see to bee a slauishe thraldome, and our wages nothing else but biting myserie. So that, if the Lorde our Sauiour Iesus Christ, by his louing cal be not able to recal vs from sinne: yet let the bitter end of Diues, and the flaminge torments of his soule damned for sinne, bee a sufficient retrait

vnto vs. Woe, wo, was due to him for sin, and therfore sinne not.
            This Diues was a rich man, God had blessed him with his creatures, and these arguments of his loue cryed vppon him, Come home by repentance, & to holines in conuersation: he notwithstanding neglected, and stil continued a seruant of sinne, for the which his seruice, he doth now lament in hellish torments, and so shall doo for euer. Hee shall alwaies howle weep and waile, in paine with out ease, in sorrowe without comfort, in griefe without reliefe, and that for euer.
            But, O miserable Diues! whie didst thou not repente and returne

from sinne, at the retrait of so manie and so great benefits of the Lord? why didst thou not plaie the good steward of thy riches, in bestowing something vpon needie Lazarus? why wast thou more vngentle and vnnaturall than the verie dogges, that licked his sores? where was charitye? surelye it was frozen, it was dead: noe better euidence than thyne owne confession, which thou makest amidest thine endlesse torments, crieng out and sayeng:
            My life was sinful, mine obedience was to Satan, my paradise was the wicked worlde, I neglected the retrait of so manie benefits from sin, & therefore

I lie in paine, and so shall doo, til I haue paide the vtmost farthing, and that is euer.
            Come hither now ye liuing, consider in time and bee wise. Diues was a sinner, and so are you: Diues neglecting the retrait from sinne, and puttinge off from daie to daie, was at lengthe vpon a sudden thruste downe into hell: and surely, if you do not in time repent, but followe his pathes, then as his ende was tormentes, so shall yours bee. For God is no accepter of persons.
            Therfore, ô ye liuing, consider & be wise: and if you haue begun the race of Diues, repent, returne, awake, least Satan take you napping, and the

Lord in his iust iudgement suffer him to take your soules frō you, and so rob you of all ioye for euer.
            If Diues had known the tyrannie of Satan, or the wages of his seruice, or the dangerous extremities of carnal securitie: no doubt he would haue awaked from sinne, and bin as wise before hand to haue prouided for himselfe, as hee was to late for his brethren.
            And shall wee, knowing the danger of deferring to repent, & the vilanie of sinne, not prouide before hand against such a dangerous tempest, as Diues abode, and walke wisely: but incur the danger of extremitie by sleeping in carnal securitie,

and perilous seruice of sinne?
            O ye sonnes of men, be wise and repent, returne from your wicked waies, giue the old serpent the slip, forsake your old maister sinne, bid adieu to all iniquitie, if you will not swim in the tormentorie seas of hell with Diues.
            Besides this bitter retrayte from sin, there bee other trumpeters of Gods iust iudgments whiche ought continuallie to mooue, and effectuallie to persuade vs to forsake the seruice of sinne and Satan. The whole world did serue Satan, bicause it ouerflowed with sinne, therfore beholde, it ouerstreamed with water, and al the worlde was drowned.
            
               
Here, if it please al sinners to put on the spectacles of discretion, they may see what it is to serue sinne, and what to neglecte the Lordes retraite from iniquitie. The whole worlde hauing forsaken the lord God, wente a whooring after Satan, and marryed it selfe to sinne, renouncing innocency of life, to folow vice; but lo the ende: when Satan by sinne had gotten suche a maysterie, and by reason of iniquitie was becom a prince of this world, beholde the end of all his practises: the ruine and destruction of the world.
            And surelie this was the iudgment of the Lorde, to destroy them wholie, that had neglected

to hear his voice in the day of visitation: & this iudgement is bent against al those that cō
               tinue in sinne and will not repent.
            Indeed the Lord hath made a couenant, and therof he hath giuen vs a certaine sacrament and earnest penie, that he for sinne will neuer drowne the world againe: but yet the couenant may breed in vs no securitie, but rather it is a retrait from sinne, forsomuch as it is a couenant betweene the Lord and vs, betweene whome no couenant can continue for euer, vnlesse wee returne from sinne.
            For although hee hath promised not to destroy the world

againe for sinne, and this promise shall be perfourmed, not because we deserue it, but because hee hath promised: yet vnles we repent, Omnes similiter peribimus. We shall al likewise perish. He wil drowne vs in wo for euer.
            This flood of torments, and hellish lake, wherein the damned doo wallowe, and wade in vnspeakable paine: this floud doth passe the other, and vnles we repent, and by heartie repentance leape into Noahs arke, and so into the bosome of mother Sion, there is no saluation for vs.
            Let vs therefore repent, and lament our sinnes, and close our selues in the readie arke of

Moses, least being at the brink of death, the waters of hell ouer swallow vs.
            But to come from the whole world to the part: behold Sodom and Gomorrha, the twoe stewes of Sathan, wherein hee dayly committed fornication with the sonnes of men. Those two, Sodom and Gomorrha, were as wanton Damosels of this world, giuen to all lewdnes and lust, they 
                  〈…〉
               sed after sinne, howsoeuer Satan piped.
            They had renounced al godlie chastitie, and to marrie the olde serpente they had broken their obedience vnto the lord. But be hold, those two wild cities were tamed, destroyed: yea burnt with fire and brimstone.
            
               
Now, O ye children of men, come and see the terrible sight of these two citties burning & consuming with fire: repente and lament your owne liues, that you are not behinde Sodom and Gomor in wickednesse, but like miserable wretches, haue pledged them in the cuppe of spirituall fornication with sinne and Satan.
            Let this fire and birmstone, like terrible Trumpetters of Gods iust iudgementes, sound so shrill in your eares, as to awake you from sleeping anye longer in sinne, least a worse thing than this doo happen vnto you: yea whensoeuer you see water, fire, and brimstone,

thinke vppon the iudgementes of God against sin, and sinne not.
            Consider that Sodom and Gomor were destroied for sin, and that God, when it pleaseth him, maye execute his iudgement vppon thee, whosoeuer thou be vnlesse thou repent: & therefore returne from sin, and sinne not.
            Consider, that where al creatures were made for mans vse: yet ye Lord in his wrath against sinne, doth vse them as swords of vengeance, to cut him off. And therefore, if wee will not onelie haue the Lord, but also his creatures to profite vs, so that wee may vse them to the ende they were created, then

where not onlie the Lord him selfe, but also all his creatures doo crie vpon vs, Repent and sinne not: it standeth vs vpon to amende our faultes, to reforme our liues, and to frame our selues to all good workes, which God hath prepared for vs, that we should walk therein.
            But, ô the lamentable case of Iesus Christ! O the vnspeakable churlishnesse of man! for if the churlishnesse of one wicked citie Ierusalem, did wring teares out of the glorious eyes of our Sauior Iesus Christ, and made him to sigh and sob, because shee had dealt so vncurteouslie with him, so preposterouslie with hir self, as to stone

his prophets, to refuse his clocking, and to serue satan, and so to worke her owne destruction: then what yeere, what daie, what houre: naye, what moment doo wee not all make our Sauior Iesus Christ, beholding our iniquities, to weepe and to sob, sith that our sinnes almost do passe in number the sands of the sea, and haires of our heads?
            Yea, O the churlishnes of man! yet by sinne so to grieue our Sauiour Iesus Christ, from the which to redeem vs it cost him bloudye teares, euen the effusion of his moste pretious blood. But is it not a miserable follie in man, by such churlish dealing to offend our Lord Iesus

Christe, who shal come to iudge the quick and the dead.
            Ye swearers, ye cursers, and railers, ye vsurers, theeues, and murtherers, yee epicures, Papists, and carnall Gospellers, al ye sinners that lie in sinne, that knowe sinne, and yet forsake it not, with what face will you present your selues before this heauenlie iudge, out of whom you haue wroonge so manye sobs, as you haue commytted sinnes in your life?
            If you haue vsed him so vnthankfullie, and wrought him such greefe: how can you look but for griefe for your reward? But, O the mercie of the Lord! that yet crieth, Come vnto me al ye that labour, and are heauie

laden, and I will refreshe you. Behold, notwithstanding your infinite offenses, notwith standing your infinite sinnes: yet, if you will acknoweledge them, and bee hartilie sorie for them, that in cōmitting them, you haue greeued the spirit of Iesus Christ, he is readie to receiue you: yea, and as one thirsting to receiue you into fauor again, he calleth vnto you Come: promising, that notwithstanding you bee laden and clogged with sinne, that yet he wil ease you, if you will come vnto him. This is a comfortable retrait, grounded vpon the promise of Iesu Christ, that if we wil come vnto him, he will refresh vs.
            
               
Now what is Iesus Christe? and what are we? wee are sinners, and therefore our due is death: but Iesus Christ is a sauiour: yea, saluation and life it selfe: and therefore to goe to him, and to leaue sinne, is to passe from death to life, from sorow of conscience to peace: yea, such a peace as passeth all 
                  〈…〉
               erstanding.
            Yea, Iesus Christ is truth, and therefore if wee will sinne no more, but in a contrite spirite repaire vnto him, then will he receiue vs: hee will refresh vs with the deintie comfort of his holie spirite, and at length receiue vs into ioy, therin to liue with him for euer.
            Therefore, if wee haue stopped

our eares at so manie retraits sounded against sin: yet let this one comfortable spech vttered by our Sauiour Christ, serue in stead of manie, Come: but and if this retrait of Iesus Christ be not able to call thee effectualy to repentance, then turn thine eies vnto his crosse, and beholdinge the villanie of sinne thy maister, and Satan the subtile serpent, repent and amend.
            Beholde the lambe of God, he that came in the similitude of sinfull flesh, to saue thee by his death. Behold how the diuel hath handled him, behold how his helhoundes haue intreated him, and all for s
                  •
               nne. Behold his holy bodie racked,

behold his holie feet & handes rent with nails, his head crowned with thornes, his pretious side launced with a speare. Beholde his pretious bloud dropping, yea outstreaming: behold howe the onelie beloued sonne of God, our louing and blessed Sauiour, lo how tyrannouslie the ministers of Satan haue vsed him.
            But why are his holie armes outstretched? why dooth his holie head bow it selfe down? why are his feete and hands so torne with nailes? why dooth his pretious blood spinne out? why is this holie lamb of God so piteouslie slaughtered vpon the tree?
            Surely O man, thou thy selfe

haste ministred the cause, and thy sinnes haue wrought this crueltie vppon this innocent Lambe Iesus Christe: so that if thou either loue Iesus Christ whome thy sinnes haue torne so cruelly, or tender thine own case, for whom he died so mercifullie, beyond thy merit: sin no more, but repent, repent, repent, and defie the diuel, and al his tyrannie.
            Yea, and sith his head, his armes, his hands, his feete, his side, and pretious bloud doo so cleerelie shew the tyrannie of sinne: detest, abhor, and auoid it. And whereas his thornie crowne that tore his head: and the nailes that rent his handes and feete: and the speare, that

pearsed his glorious side: doo all crie out vppon vs, that wee haue so rente and torne by our sinnes Iesus Christ our blessed Sauiour, let vs for shame bee ashamed of our villanie.
            Let vs lament, and repente our iniquities, least that the ve rie thornie crowne of his head the verie nailes that fastened him to the tree, and the speare that pearsed his side, doo testifie a iust condemnatiō against vs, that we did so vnthankfully vse them to destroy the sonne of God, and yet doo commyt sinne, to our power seeking to slaie him againe.
            O yee butchers! consider this innocent Lambe, how he bleedeth, and sheaddeth his

pretious bloud, to cleanse you from sinne, and so to saue you from Satan: drinke vp in faith the droppings of his bloud, and moisten your soules therwith: eate him and chewe him: for hee is the bread of life, which whosoeuer eateth, he shall neuer hunger any more.
            Bid war to old Adam proclaime battell against the subtile serpent, and fight like good souldiers of Christ crucified, against sinne: that death and hel beeing put to the foile, by the strength of your valiant capitain, ye may at length be registred among the blessed saints of God for euer.
            But if al this will not moue thee, O foolish creature, to repentance:

neither the miserable seruice of Satan, nor the horrible end of sinne, nor the maiestie or mercie of Iesus Christ, nor the villanie that sin wrought vnto him, which all ought to be forcible motiues, and sufficient retentiues from sinne: yet consider a while the condition of sinners, which of al other is most miserable.
            For first, they are Gods enimies, euen such rebellious enimies, as with open armes in Satans quarrel, vnder corrupt nature, as their souereigne, resist Gods gouernment: which thing, O sinfull man, is of all other most horrible, to be Gods enimie, to be at war with God to be hated of the most mightie,

puissant and omnipotente Lord of hosts.
            Neither doo sinners, by warring against the honor of God vnder sinne and Satan, onelye purchase the anger and hatred of God vpon their heads: but also they greeue the courtiers of Ierusalem, which is aboue and put the Angels and Saints of God to great greefe and sor row.
            For if that they reioise at the conuersion of a sinner, and bee gladde when the loste groat is found, and the straieng sheepe brought to the sheepfold: then what greefe, what sorow, what heauinesse do sinners purchase vnto them, when being loste, they wil not be found: and being

straieng sheepe, they will not be brought to the sheepefold of grace againe.
            And heere it may please all sinners to consider, that as repenting wee gladden the Angels and Saintes of God, and make the diuell to repine and greeue: so, when wee commit sinne, and decline from the right line of righteousnes, then do we keepe wakes for the diuel, then dooth he hop for ioy, when we defraud the good angels of God of their ioy.
            These irreuocable sinners, these the Lorde dooth hate, as vtter enimies: yea, rotten and stinking carion is more sweete before men, than is such a soule before God and his Aungels.

And therefore let all such repent, not onelie because they are iniurious to God, and offensiue to the good: but also bicause they are stinking creatures and such as the Lord neither may nor will abide, vnles they returne vnto him in sackcloth and ashes: and therefore repent and amend.
            Secondly, those sinners that stop their eares against the retrait of these motiues, let them consider their woonderous follie. For sinne is the dung of the old serpent, and he that sinneth for the vilest thing that is, forsaketh the most pretious iewel in heauen and earth.
            For what dooth mans soule lose by sinne? from whom departeth

she? from whom doth she separate hir selfe? euen frō God her maker, her redeemer and Sauiour: yea when shee sinneth she forsaketh saluation and her owne safetie, she runneth into the stinking lappe of the diuell her desperate aduersarie, and hasteneth hirselfe vn to hell.
            Yea, by sinne the kingdome of the diuel is inlarged: for he that committeth sinne is the seruant of sinne. And what if I saye that sinne maketh man like to Satan? for whatsoeuer deformitie or filth is in the diuell, that is by sinne: of the which if the Deuill might bee freed, he were a noble and excellent creature. Euen so the

soule of man, by sinne is made filthie and deformed like the Diuel. And what an iniurie is this to God, that by sinne, of his owne image, wee shoulde make the image of the diuell?
            Repent therefore, and consider thirdlie, that it gladdeneth the diuell to see vs sin, because thereby we become his dwelling house. Now how cursed a thing is sinne, which maketh the temple of God the temple of Satan? what follie: nay, what madnes is it to lodge the diuel in our heartes, and to driue Christ and his holie spirit out of doores?
            Why shoulde man deale so vnthankefullie with him, that being God, came from the top

of the heauens to this vallie of miserie, to take mans flesh vpon him, that hee might be his Iesus? or why should we sinne, and by continual sinning, bid adieu to the spirit of holines, & harbor satan in our harts? shall he, by whom al creatures were made glorious, by sinne bee banished far from vs? and he, by whome all creatures were deformed, bee wholie lodged within vs?
            But tel me, O man, Christ is saluation, life, ioy, loue, and all in al; the diuell is the father of death, a murderer, a manslaier, a tyrant, a prince of darknesse, the worker of woe. Now answer, doest thou like better of death, than of lyfe: of paine,

than of ioye: of hatred, than loue: of damnation, than saluation: and of hel, than of hea uen? if thou doo, then shalt thou depart curssed into the euerlasting fire. But if thou doo prefer Iesus Christ, with his inesti mable blessings, before Satan: then why doost thou wallowe in sinne, which is the onelye waie to preferre Satan in this world, & to establish his kingdome of darknes?
            Wherfore, O miserable man repent and amende: consider that Iesus Christ, like an euangelical henne, neuer ceaseth clocking to gather thee vnder his winges like a chicken: let him not clock & cal in vaine, neither be thou like vnto them

that stoppe their cares against the charmer, charme he neuer so wiselie.
            Consider that God created thee wholie to serue him, with al thy hart, soule, strength, and power: remember that thou at baptisme diddest vowe and swear obedience to his name: remember that before GOD, and al the bande of the holye Aungels and Saints, thou didst renounce satan, & al his works, and repent, vnlesse thou wilte haue God and all his heauenlie Citizens, at the great daie of reuelation, to giue sentence of condemnation against thy periurie.
            And why, O miserable man, shouldest thou break thy faith

giuen to God in baptisme? it is not an oth to bee repented. For the seruice of the Lorde is onelie mans safetie, as the seruice of Satan is the only cause of mans miserie.
            The gailor that helde vs in a slauishe and spirituall Aegypt, was not Pharao, but the diuel, and that for sinne: and therefore, if we couet to inhabi
                  •
                the land of promise, and to liue in libertie, free from calamitie, it standeth vs vppon to returne vnto the Lorde, who is onelie able, by his outstretched arme to saue and defend vs, from the myserable seruitude of so tyrannous a ruler.
            Againe, al the spirits in hell may cursse the filthie bondage

of sinne, by seruice whereof they are in torments, and shall continue in paines vnspeakeable for euermore. The saintes and holie ones of God are in blisse, in ioy: yea in such ioye, as neyther eie hath seene, nor eare heard, nor hart euer conceiued. And whie? euen because they repented, forsooke s
                  〈…〉
               ne, and did the will of God in heauen. For they onlie haue entred, and shall enter into the kingdome of heauen, that doo the wil of our heauenly father.
            Therefore, sith his wil is our sanctification, innocencie of life, puritie in conuersation, vprightnes of hart, abstinence from the lustes of the fleshe: if that wee hope to enioye the

beeing taken awaie, wee may with moste willinge consents ioyne handes with Iesus Christe our Capteine, against Satan, sinne, the fleshe, and the world: which enimies doo bitterlie, and also continuallye war against vs, and far exceed our strength to resist them, vnlesse that we forsake them, and shrowd our selues vnder Iesus Christ, to whom be al glorie both now and for euer, Amen.

               O Father of endles mercy, the fountayne and welspring of all perfect happines, the giuer of grace, the bestower of true

blessednes, & felicity: heere vs, ô heare vs for thy bottomlesse compassion sake, and grant vnto vs, we hum bly beseech thee, whatsoeuer wanteth in vs towardes the acomplishment of our calling and duty.
            And because thy holye word the trumpet of truth, & treasure of great riches, hathe in expresse speeche threatened manye stripes to that negligent seruaunt whiche knoweth thy will, and yet doth it not: vouchsafe vs, and as manye of vs as are instructed & taught, and thereby perceiue and

vnderstand thy heauenlye pleasure, endeuouringe to walke thereafter, maye auoid that penalty of negligence, which is denounced against the idle seruant: thy grace preuenting vs in all our actions and intents.

            Now, most mercifull Father, for that the helpes to holines of life are infinite: some, and those singular, consisting in thy Gospell preached: some, and those notable, in sinceritie of

conuersation, and examples of godlines expressed: some, and those speciall, in exhortations tending vnto Christianitie declared: some, and those heauenlie, in praiers and supplications conteyned: maye it please thee, of thine vnspeakable goodnes, ô mercifull Father, to gyue vs grace so to imprinte them in our memories, and to haue them sealed in our heartes, that the course of our whole life may testifie to the world, that thy gifts in vs are not voyd and frustrate, barren and fruiteles,

vaine and vnused. Least being otherwise, it chaunce vnto vs, as vnto him that knitting vpp his talent in a napkin, & hiding the same in the ground, had not onlye the same taken from him, but was also cast into vtter darknesse for his ydle nes & vnprofitable seruice.
