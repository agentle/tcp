            The Epistle
            of my dutie to your woorshipfull house. But hauing imagined many waies to present you with the testimonie of my humble looue, & finding none either more agreeing to mine estat, or fitting for your worship then this new translatiō of this pleasant history out of Latin, which I haue at idle times vnder taken: whose stile, although it may seeme rude and barberous and vnfitting your Worship, yet I doe not mistrust but the matter beeing both pithie and plesaunt will incite you to read it at your leasures & censure it (not according to the vvorth) but according to the dutiful desire of the giuer.
            And though I the vnskilfullest of many doe seeme as it were to pluck Hercules clubbe out of his hands in vndertaking this translatiō, which might beseem a far deeper scholler then my self: yet hauing not in my pore oppinion impaired the credit nor wronged my Author in my translation forcing him to speak rude English (which floweth with eloquēce in latine) yet because my leasure serued and my dutie bad mee be thankfull, I rather chose this more then any other, which with all dutiful affection I commend to your learned view. Thus crauing your acceptāce of this pore widowes mite, vndertaking the patronage of the same I wish you all helth and happines.
            
               Your Woorships at command.

               Chap. 1.
               
                  The first Chapter entreateth of the byrth of Blanchardine, his nurssing and his bringing vp.
               
               
                  AMongst many antient Chronicles importing the haughtie exploites of sundry nations, Lords and Princes: this story of the valorous Blanchardine deserueth greatest commendation of true and perfect magnanimitie.
               At the time when a generall peace concluded throughout the most part of Christēdome, when gentlemen and Noble Péeres made their returne from armes and applyed them selues to domesticall and cuntrie pastimes:
               There reigned a King in the Realme of Frize redoubted for manhood and prowes, abounding in goodes and possessions, reuerenced and beloued both of his subiect

                   and equalls, and most happie in all his attempts [sauing in ye want of issue] to succéed him in his king dōe, wherof, bothe he and the Queene his wife were most pensiue and discontented: and by mutuall complaints greatly bewailed this misfortune. But the Queene desirous to frustrate the scandal that might aryse by reason of her ba
                     •…
                  ēnes: day by day, (in moste deuout and humble manner) solicited the Gods to send her a sonne, whose dayly and deuout prayers penetrating the heauens, by the permision and fauour of the Gods she conceiued and bare a sonne, whome at the christning they named

                  Blanchardine. This vnexpected ioy bred such a contentment to the King and Quéene, and a comfort to all the Realm
                     •…
                  , that after humble thankes giuen to the Gods: feasts, banquets and all triumphes were proclaimed throughout the Realme of Friz And least the Childe (should by absence from the Parents through negligence of the Nursse) miscarie: the Queene her self vndertooke his nurssing and bringing vp.
               The Childe grew in beautie, proportion, wit and manners, beyond the expectation of all men. And when he was arriued to the age of discretion, he was committed to the tuition of a graue and learned Tutor to be instructed in Philosophie, by whose industrie and painful labour he soone attained to perfection: his exercises and disportes at idle times were hawking, hunting, and playing at Chesse, and in such pastimes he spent some part of his youth til his maturitie and riper age, made him desirous to follow armes and feates of chiualrie, as heerafter you shall heer.
            
            
               Chap. 2.
               
                  How Blanchardine walking in his Fathers Pallace accompaned with his Tutor, he perused in the hangings of Tapestrie and Arras, the sack and distruction of the famous Cittie of Troy.
               
               
                  IT hapned on a day that Blanchardine and his Tutor walking within the Pallace of the King his father, and stedfastly pervsing the abstracts & deuises in the hangings, demaunded of him what warlike seidge and slaughter of men, that might be which he saw figured in the same: and hearing his Master so to blazon ye warres of the Greekes in this ten yeeres seidge gainst Troy gaue more d

                     ax, and withall, the ingenious capacitie of graue Vlisses: the large circuite of the Cittie, and princely buildings of the same: so that from that time foorth hée conceiued small delight in any thing,

but only in recording the magnanimitie, haughtie courages and the great commendations atcheiued by that victorie. Then questioned he with his Master of the blazonry of armes, and ye quartering of these coates, which were portraied in the said tapistry: wherin béeing by him most perfectly resolued, his minde was more & more instigated and pricked forward to atchiue the honor which others in that map had (as he learned) acquired: so that (all other pleasures and delights laid apart) continually practised both in action and in reading, the imitation of those valorous warres, neither thought he any time so wel bestowed as either in reciting, reading or conferring of those warres.
            
            
               Chap. 3.
               
                  The deuices of Blanchardine after he had left his conference with his Master & of his departure from his Fathers Court without the priuitie of any.
               
               
                  
                     BLanchardine béeing come into his Chamber, pensiue and sad that he had not atchiued any enterprize neither as yet had lerned to beare armes by reason of the tender care his Parents had ouer him, concluded with himself the meanes of his departure, and couertly practised with himself some secret way for his escape, least that the priuitie thereof beeing once discouered hée should be preuented of his purpose.
               In these perplexities and solitarye deuices hee spent great parte of his time, sur-cha
                     •…
                  nged with excéeding anguishe of minde for his aduēterous flight: and fearing least pouertie might bréed daunger, he purueyed him self of a most rich & trustry sword belonging to the King his father, which when he had fastned to his side, hee tooke more courage then before: then pricked forward with the spurre of honor and armes, he foorthwith left his Parents and people surprized with sound sléepe, and about the houre of one of the clock in the morning came to ye stable where stood many gallant & seruiceable horses: but amongst all other,

hée chose the courser his father tooke greatest pleasure in, whome incontinently hee sadled and furnished with a moste sumptious caparizon: whome when he had made ready, (as he imagined) hee led softly out of the stable, the Groomes by reason of their heauie sléepe hearing no noyes at all.
               Thus finding him selfe frée and vnseene of any, hee incontinently mounted his horsse, and beeing mounted on his back, he posted away with all celeritie: But leauing Blanchardine on his iourney that way which fortune led him, I wil make mention what pittifull complaintes were made in the Court, after his departure for his absence.

                   encountred: who not only had be mangled his limbes, but also bereft him of his looue and Mistresse which he had carried away

perforce: when Blanchardine beheld this moste heauie spectacle, alighting from his horse comforting the dismaid knight, holpe to binde vp his bleeding wounds & withall inquiring of him ye cause of his mishap & the man that so inhumain like had left him in this distresse: hee answered, braue young Lord, I trauelling along these plaines tending my

                     •…
                  o my house, distant from hence not past two leagues, was on the suddain encountred by a vilain who not only hath left me mangled and wounded as you see, but also hath caried by force from me my wife, whose absence will be the presēt cause of my death, and whose daunger brings greater sorrow to my heart then all these woundes, which I endure.
               Why quoth Blanchardine how long since departed hee hence and left you thus distressed? the wounded Knight replyed, scarce half an houre agoe, he tooke his way towards yonder wood and caried my looue with him: then replyed Blanchardine I neuer yet vntil this day haue vndertaken armes, but let mée request you to honor me with the order of knight-hood and I will pawne my life to dye or to recouer againe your looue. Then said the wounded man I will not only make you knight, but withall (if you please) arme you with this my armour and launce, that shall adde more strength to your courage: and besides, I will 
                     •…
                  rorate the Gods, to send you all happines, not only in this, but in all other your honorable attemptes.
               Sir quoth Blanchardine, I thinke me sufficiently honored, by this your offer, therefore disarme your selfe speedily, that he may not be past recouerie, before I ouertake him. So the wounded Knight armed him, and invested him with the order of Knighthood: when Blanchardine saw himselfe thus arraied, his youthly courage prickt him on, who taking his horse, mounted the Saddle, wher brauely managing him vpon the plaine, to proue how well he could rule his Launce, found himselfe (as he thought) fit for this enterprize. And so with valiant c
                     •…
                  rage, and cheerefull countenance, hée tooke his leaue of the 
                     〈◊〉
                   Knight, and posted after the other, that had carried away his wife.
               He had not ridden long, but he perceiued the tracktes, & footsteps of a horse, that had lately gon that way▪ and following those steps, with a spéedy pace, he heard the pittifull complaint, that a

Lady made to appease the raging lust of a villaine who sought perforce to rauish her, whom presently hée found hid vnder the shadow of a leafye trée, beating ye poore distressed Lady, the wife of the wounded knight: to whom making spéedy approch, vassail (quoth he) desist from this cruell and damnable enterprize, for I sweare by heauen, I will make thée repent this absurd vilany.
               The Knight seeing Blanchardine to be young, & greatly gréeued for his sodaine approch, made semblance of much wrath, but Blanchardine with austere countenance, & Princely voice, commaunded him presently to frée the Lady, whom most wrongfully he had caried away from her husband, whom hee left almost ready to yéeld vp the ghost.
               The knight disdaining to be so vpbraid by so yong a knight, bestirred himselfe presently, and made him ready to the fight. But (withall) commaunded Blanchardine to desist from his enterprize, and leaue him to his pleasure (or if not) it should cost him his life.
               
                  Blanchardine not able to endure these cruell menaces, willed him to addresse him to the combat quickly, or he would send him body and soule to hell: wherevpon hee furnished himselfe to the fight.
               
                  The combate betweene Blanchardine and the Knight.
                  
                     THese braue caualiers being mounted, encountred ech other, with such agility that their speares shiuered in the ayre, & each of them admiring the valure of his foe: and finding their launces broken, they betooke them selues to their swords: long remained the fight doubtfull, till Blanchardine remembring the equitie of his quarrell, and the honor he should atchiue by this conquest, with all the agillity and strength hee could, (mounting himselfe on his stirrops) so feircely assailed his foe, that vnnayling his armor and vnlacing his helmet, he sent him

to carry newes of Blanchardines valure, to the infernall ghosts. which when the Lady saw so brauely accomplisht, she foorthwith gaue thankes to God and him for this deliuerie. Then Blanchardine, seuering the head of the slaine traitorous Knight from his body, hung it at the pombell of his Saddle, and set the Lady on the Knights horse, and posted towards the wounded knight:

                  LOng ridde Blanchardine through the forrest, till at length he came to a high hill, at the foote whereof there ran a riuer most deep and perrillous, whether when Blanchardine was come, he trauersing vp and downe to finde a passage, was espied by the knight of the ferry and by him aduised not to venter ouer (in any case) because there was no landing on the other side. Blanchardine alighting, thanked the knight much, & requested the boate to ship him ouer, which the knight of the Ferry presently dispatched away. Blanchardine entring the boate was by the industry

of two Mariners conducted to the further short: at whose arriuall the knight of the Ferry attended to receiue him, with such kinde and courteous salutations, that much encreased Blanchardines loue towards him, and the knight precisely veiwing the singuler beautie of Blanchardine mixt with a kinde of maiestie and courage, requested to knowe the place of his abode, and the cause of his comming thither: to whome Blanchardine with princely grace and eloquent spéech related at large the Cuntrey where he was born, & the aduenture that mooued him to trauell, which was by reason that all parts about the Realme of Frize, were setled in tranquilitie & quiet: and héerupon hee vndertooke this inquest to acquire honor and fame by his Chiualrie.
               The knight of the Ferry much delighted with this braue resolution, and highly commending the valour of Blanchardine (beeing so young and yet of so haughtie courage) requested him h

Now (if it shall please God) that you by your haughty prowes and manly courage, shall defend her from Alimodes, I doubt not but that in time, (considering your excellencie of person and princely behauiour) shée may consent to be your wife: alas Sir, (quoth Blanchardine) can you imagine any possibilitie in mée to obtaine her whome so many Princes of high estates haue vndertaken, and haue their intents and purp

               Wel sir answered the knight of the ferry, nothing is imposible in loue, and although she haue béen hetherto most obstinate and peruerse in liking: yet loue may chance to make seizure vpon her tender heart, when shée least suspecteth.
               And by reason of the entire affection I beare you, (séeing you so resolute, to performe any thing for our Countries good) If it shall please you to bée rulde by my aduice, I will vndertake that our Quéene shalbe your wife, and thus it is.

It were conuenient that you should present your selfe vnto her, to aide her in these wars: which I know shee wil accept so thākfully, that nothing can bring her (at this time) more content: you shall (I say) therefore goe, and in your iourny I know you shall ouer take her, accompained with a most gallant and redoubted troope of Dukes, Earles, Lords, Barons, and Knights: But her age, & custome is, to ride very softly & behind all the troope, onely accompained, with an aged Lady, whom she calleth her nurse: and for her grauetie, hath the greatest credit and preheminence with the Queene: now sir if you can by al the possible meanes deuise to fasten a kisse vpon her lips, Ile pawne my life, you shalbe the happiest man aliue, and the only possessor of her loue: faile not therefore to do as I haue Councelled you, but as secret as you can: & so I commit you to the mercy of God, and the fauour of the Queene.
               
                  Blanchardine comforted with these good newes, after a gentle conioy taken of the knight, he bethought himselfe how he might obtaine a kisse of the Queene. And meditating vpon this only thing, at last he espied the gallant troope of Lordes, according to the tale and report, of his host the knight of the ferry. But approching something néerer, hee espied the Quéene accordingly, hindmost in the same traine: only accompained with an olde Lady: then Blanchardine (pricked forward by the instinct of looue, and the knights warrantize) determined with him selfe to effect his purpose, although he should léese his life therfore: and in this thoughthe called vpon God to ayde him in his enterprize.

                  AS soone as Blanchardine came in sight of the Quéen thrust sorth by hope, yet recald by feare, but most desirous to accomplish and effect his determination, séeing the Lady rid a great way behinde her companie: and finding the place conuenient, spurred his horse and ran so hastely that the Quéene wundering who that might be that posted so fast after, turning her hed to looke back, their lippes met with swéet coniunction.
               Then Blanchardine (hauing perfourmed as much as hée desired) gallopped swiftly away, saluting the nobles of the traine with such a debonayre and amiable countenance, that they were all astonisht, what princely caualier hee might be that posted so far afore the company: and withall, carying a singuler and great c

                   sacred Queene of holy nimphes: O thou Celestiall Goddesse, whome from my Infancie I haue adored, reuenge chaste Hecoetae this outrage which is offred to me, by that accursed stranger: I that haue hetherto preserued my body, from the raging heat of lawlesse lust, am now vnwittingly surprized, when least I suspected: O had I called vnto my train at yt very instant, to haue murdered the villaine in his flight, rather then so dasterdly a lad should triumph in my spoile: But hear I vow, that no day, time or houre, shall passe, wherein I will not seeke reuenge of that cruell and accursed traitor, who thus arogantly hath distained both my vow and honor. Ah nurse, what shall I doe, shal I send these Lords post after him, to slay him before he entred the Citty? or if hee be entred before they come, shall I by my expresse commaundement, charge my seruants and louing subiects, that hée neuer see more dayes then this? The nurse seeing her in these extreames, sought by all meanes to asswage, and pacifie her teares, and began to perswade her in these tearmes.
               What madame, make you such an Idoll of your selfe, that for a kisse you will seeke to shead the blood of so noble and braue a gentleman as he is, whose kindnes to you meriteth no such hate? If you punish such sclender faultes with like rigor as you

meane to inflict on this gentleman, what wil you doe to him that intreateth you in more dishonorably sorte? Be pacified (for shame madam) and let not the world wonder at that, which none but I & you are acquainted withal: leap madame vppon your palfrey, and dry vp these womanish teares, least being by your owne folly bewraied, it bréed a scandall to your name, and no benefite to your selfe.
               By these, or the like perswasions, the nursse appeased the quéenes passions, who mounted on her palfrey, rode to the Citty of Tormada, intending yet neuerthelesse, (if she could heare any newes of Blanchardine) to punish him by one meane or other: in which opinion let her rest, and returne we againe to Blanchardine.
               
            
            
               Chap. 10.
               
                  How Blanchardine entred the Citty of Tormaday and was lodged at the Provosts house.
               
               
                  PResently as Blanchardine was entred the Citty of Tormaday, perusing with diligent circumspection, the Cituation of the towne, the stately Buildings of Abbeis, Churches, Monestaries, and sumptuous houses, besides the great, and manyfolde commodities, which the sea by his neighbourhood, did inrich the Citie withall, hee grew into great admiration with himselfe what and how happy a man he might be, if he could so effect his desired purpose as to wed the Quéene & be sole King & commaunder of so royall an Empire: and in these meditations, approching to the chief market place of the cittie, he made inquisition for lodging for himselfe and his horse: vnto whome reply was made, that by reason of the multitude of the traine which came with her maiestie, the towne had scarce place to furnish those that were comming in their ayde, against King Aimodes. But if it pleased him to goe to the house of the Prouost, there no

doubt but he might finde entertainment and be lodged: Blanchardine requested him to direct him the way to the Prouosts house, which he willingly consented to doe. So he approching néere the Prouosts gate, espied him sitting there: of whome Blanchardine in most kinde and ciuill manner, demaunded lodging, but the Prouost replyed, know sir, that he that determineth to lodge héere, must performe the contentes written in this marble stone ouer the gate. Thē 
                  Blanchardine fixing his eies on the stone and this inscription, which did no whit at all discontent him.
               
                  He that will enter heer,
                  must try it by shield and speare:
                  Against all those that be herein,
                  or els his cheere shalbe but thin.
               
               VVHen Blanchardine had read this Inscription, he smiled to himselfe, thinking by this meane, not only to bee lodged in the Prouosts house, the principall of the Citty: but also (if hee could conquer and subdue him) to purchase great commendation of the inhabitants, so that at the length, his valure might be certified and made knowne to the Queene, in whose excellent beautie his thoughts were harbored. The Prouost perceiuing that he had read the inscription, and withall to smile at the newes, made enquirie if he meant to lodge in his house that night or no? Blanchardine replyed, that if he might be furnished with armour, shield and launce accordingly, he would performe as much as the writing did importe.
               The Prouost wondring at the audacitie of Blanchardine commaunded foorthwith his men to arme him: whome when the Prouost and all the people beheld armed, they with one consent adiudged him a man of most excellent prowes and person: Blanchardine mounting presentlye his horse, called to the Prouost to hasten to the fight: it was not long, before the Prouost was seated in his sadd
                     •…
                  e, when the Trumpets giuing the charge, they encountred the one the other with such dexteritie, that all the people stood astonished to beholde their surpassing prowes and strength: the Prouost shiuered his spear vpon Blanchardine, but

                  Blanchardine pearced the Prouosts shéeld through, & by the violence of his careir forced ye Prouost out of his sadle to the ground: Then Blanchardine alighting to vnlace his helmet, thinking either to constraine him to yéeld, or to dis-furnish him of his head, was preuented of his intended purpose: For the Prouost hauing two Daughters of passing beautie (who beheld the issue of the fight) seeing their Father in perill of his life, prostrated themselues at the feet of Blanchardine, humbly requiring life for their father: Blanchardine noting their excellent features, presently condiscended to their petitions. And by this time, the Prouost [dazeled by the fury of Blanchardines stroke] came to his sences: and perceiuing that he was vanquished, besought him to remit his forepassed fault, and withall taking his swoorde from his side deliuered it to Blanchardine in acknowledging him self subdued: which Blanchardine no sooner receiued, but redeliuered it againe with all kindenesse, [saying] that the excéeding perfections of his daughters beauties had freed him from daunger, so that hee should not bee farther endomaged: Then the Prouost humbly requested him to enter his house, and both hee and all his would rest the vassailes of his commaund.
               Now Blanchardine being brought within the Prouosts house, was by his two daughters led into a most sumptuous Chamber, furnished with all things to his estate appertaining, and by those two Virgins disarmed, and presented with a moste faire gowne furred with Martines to put on.
               Now in the meane, the Queene being entred within the Citie, presently repaired to her lodging, and in haste sent for her Nursse to conferre about Blanchardine whome shee deadly hated: But (sauing her Nurse & the Captaine of Tormayday) durst none be so bolde as to approch to her presence that night: The Captaine after he had done his reuerence vnto her Maiestie, enformed her Highnes of the ariuall of a straunge Knight, who lately entring the Cittie had combated the Prouost & ouercome him: which (when hee had deliuered) Then the proude Pusell in A
                        •…
                     , knew by the Captaines relatiō of Blanchardines horse and apparell, ye it was he that had kissed her the same day, but as then shee made no shew or semblance therof: yet shee commaunded

him to sée diligent watch and warde throughout the Cittie for feare of Allimades, and with this answere bad him good night.
               So soone as the Captaine was gone, shée called her Nursse vnto her saying: this traitour is entred the towne and hath vanquished the Prouost and lodgeth in his house, and for this night I am content to suffer him, but so soone as day appeareth, I will giue strict cōmaund that he dye an euil death, [as I am Quéene of Tormaydar] and if the Prouost shall deny or refuse to deliuer him, I will vtterly confound him and all his: In this sorte the Queens spent all the night without comfort, still exclaiming against Blanchardine.

                  THe Quéene in this manner [as you haue heard] much displesaunt for the kisse of Blanchardine, now being in the companie of her Nursse, when the calme silence of the night procured sléep to all creatures: shée could not rest, but deuising what reuenge she might take on Blanchardine, begun in this manner: Oh swéet Nursse, aduise mee I hartily pray thée what death I may cause him die, that thus against all humaine nature and the estate of a Prince hath violently offened me with this dishonour? I meane in the morning either to cause him presently to be hanged, drowned, burnt, his hed to be smitten off or his body to be quartered, and péecemeale dragged through the Cittie: and still shée séemed so obstinate in this her resolute determination, that neither any perswasions that her Nursse could imagine nor any remorce in her self could once calme this her inc
                     •…
                  ssant rage:

till at last the Nursse séeing the folly of the Quéene, and fearing the domage that might heerby arise vnto her, brake out in these tearmes.
               Madame, this Impatience beséemeth not a Princesse, neither can it any way redound to your honor thus to reuenge this simple wrong offered by the knight, whose loue to you aboue all other of your traine, made him aduenture the purchasing of your displeasure. And if in regard of this secret stollen kisse, which nothing at al doth deminish the commendation of your beauty, neither ye dignity of your estate, you wil so tiranize ouer the poore (yet valiant) Gentleman: I think that eyther you are led by some inchanted furie, or els haue giuen ouer the true tipe of honor, to imbrace pusillanimitie and folly: May not the most credible reporte of the Captaine of the inuincible valour of the Knight dissolue your combust melancholy, & reuengefull humor, in which [I say] there is neither wit, magnanimitie nor honor: Leaue Madame leaue, [and the rather at my request] these cruell minaces which now you doome vpon this braue knight whose merit deserues no such méede.
               When the Nursse had ended this perswasiue speach, and that the Lady was somwhat reclaimed & recalmed from her intended rage: shee beganne to meditate with her self, of the braue perfections which both shee had séene & also had heard by the reporte of the Captaine to be in Blanchardine: & euen then [I say] beganne the winged Boy Cupid to make seizure of her tender hart, which before that time neuer could take the impression of looue, béeing so adamanted by nature and folly: and began thus secretly to conferre with her selfe.
               What, am I led by fury or frenzie, or do I wake or sléep, that haue thus far ouershot my selfe, to condemne so braue a knight for a kisse? doubtles I cannot but imagine that méere loue prickt him forward to attempt to kisse me, or els séeing the braue & warlike troope which did at that instant attend me, and withall, the maiestie of my carriage: he would not haue (as then) aduentured to haue done it, for he might wel haue assured himself that if I should haue made but the least complaint to my Lords at that time, he could neuer haue escaped with life: well, I wil mitigate

                  ancy I perceiue to be in him, besides his beauty & stately proportion of body, which makes me to coniecture, that he cannot be discendded of base and meane parentage, but issued from most princely race of Kings: And therfore I meane to choose him to my generall in these my wars against this most pertured infidell King Alimodes: and I doubt not but that all my subiects will giue an applauditie to this my resolution: but my displeasure which was so sorely bent against him, I wil grace him with honor and kindnes. Yet by the way, I vowe, not to loue him, nor any man liuing, (in regard of carnall lust or marriage) whose issue is meere repentance and folly.

                  The Ariuall of Alimodes the Panim King at the Citty of Tormaday with his huge host of fourscore thousand Sarizens and the seidge laid thereunto.
               
               
                  AFter the Quéene had passed the night in these passions (as you haue heard) early in ye morning newes was brought, that the Panim King Alimodes, was on the Sea, bending his course towards Tormaday, and that it would not bee long before his ariuall: The Quéene sent presently to all her nobles and subiectes to arme themselues, for the defence of the citty, & withall, caused great & aboundant prouision of victuall to be brought within the walls. But not long after, she with her nurse mounting vp into a high turret and looking towardes the maine, they might discry a farre off, the huge and mighty Nauy, which by the appendants, Streamers, Flages and other signes, she well perceiued to be the King. Alimodes fleet: wherupon incontinently she caused her Nobles and Vassailes to be aduertised that speedy preparation might be made, to hinder and forbid their landing: But before they could make prouision, the King and his company were come a shore, to the great admiration of the beholders,

for the innumerable troope of soldiers and retinue: and beeing landed, they foorthwith spread themselues vpon the plaines before the Cittie, er
                     •…
                  cting their Pauilions and Tents in all hast.
               In company of the King came to this seidge, Dariui his sonne and one of his daughters of passing beauty and two other kings: the one of which was by computation fiftéene foot high, more terrible to behold then Goliah to Dauid. The king associated with his sonne and these two kings, came before ye gates, sommoning the Citizens to come to a parley, who mounting on the walles, enquired the cause of his approche in such warlike maner? vnto whom ye king replyed, That vnles they would deliuer the Lady Quéene Eglantine, that proud Lady in loue, to bée his wife, hée would neuer giue ouer his assault and seidge, till he had not only wasted the whole country with fire and sword, but also razed the walles of that famous Citty flat to the ground, and then perforce would he haue her, which hee now by entreaty desireth to wed. The townsemen replyed, that neither they had any dread of his brauadoes, neither yet would deliuer their Quéene into the hands of so mahematicall a miscreant (as himselfe) but therein presence of the two kings, gaue defiance to his face. And vpon this answere, Alimodes commaunded the Cannon to be planted against the walles, and the soldiers to giue their assault: There might you heare the Cannos roaring, the Barbed horses neighing, the glistering armor shining, the drummes striking vp, the Trumpets and clarions sounding the dismall and cruell March of the Pagans: he caused his chiefe standerd, to be erected in the midst of his host, against which the ordinaunce of the Citty played such musike, that many of the Turkes were sent to hell, to do homage to their God Mahomet: the rest did so closely (by their continual industry) intrench themselues, that the Cannon could haue no power ouer them:
               But the Citizens omitting no time that might serue for their purpose, made a secret issue out of the Towne, and so on the suddain set vpon them, that at the least two thowsand of them were slaine without any hurt to the townsemen (almost at all.)
               The Captaine and the Prouost being expert warriours, séeing the great discomfiture of their enemies, sent presently newe

supply out of the towne and so pursued the enemie, that at the least they slew fourteen hundred more, at which sodaine alarme, the King himselfe (not hearing before of the slaughter of his men) gaue a fresh charge vpon the Cittizens, so as they were (by reason of the multitude of their aduersaries) compelled to recoile backe, and entered the towne at a posterne gate, which they had giuen most especiall charge to the Cittizens, to be kept for that purpose.
               Now Alimodes hearing the retreat of his enemies sounded, he retired him self againe into his pauillion, greatly displeased for this his extreame losse & slaughter of his soldiers at the begining of his seidge: but Blanchardine all this while standing vpon the walles, and séeing the valure of the Cittizens, and the disconfiture of the infidells, mourned to him self: whome when the Prouost being returned had saluted, enquiring the cause of his heauines: (Ah sir quoth he) I haue forsaken father, and mother, country and fréends to séeke aduentures in strange landes, and wishing all happines to the most redoubted Empresse of Tormaday: yet finding my selfe altogether vnarmed, and vnfit to enter the sight vnfurnished, makes me to haue this dolance and griefe. The prouost greatly cōmending the generositie and manly courage of Blanchardine, presently gaue him the choise of all his armours, and himselfe fitted it on his backe, and commaunded his horse presently to be brought foorth, intending both to issue together out vpon the enemy.
               One of the daughters of the Prouost, perceiuing Blanchardine to be armed, ready to be gone with her father, brought him a white damask caparizon for his horse. And withall a black scarfe for himselfe to weare, which shée requested him to carry in his helmet for her sake: Blanchardine most thankfully receiued these fréendly presents, and imployed them as you haue heard. So the damosell recommending them both to the protection of God, humbly tooke her leaue.

                     BLanchardine and the Prouost thus brauely mounted, made hast to the gate of the Citty, to issue out on the enemie: whether being arriued, buckling on their helmets, their shieldes at their backes and their launces in their hands, thus hauing the conduct of thrée thousand men, they marched in equipage, out of the towne towardes the enemy, who not vnprouided, awaited their comming. Blanchardine burning in desire of glory, put himself into the formost ranke, and being without the Barriers of the towne, they began to encounter each other, so that the noyse of their horses made the earth to sound, the clamor was so great, as though the foure eliments had met together: the sunne was darkened by reason of the dust that rose in the ayre: Blanchar. being formost, gaue thassault to Corbadas nephew to king Alimode▪
                   a man mighty in body & prowes: but vpon the encounter Blanchardines launce entred through his armor, and so he fell from his horse dead. And following on his fortunate beginning, before he brake his launce, he slew at the least six or seauen. Then betaking himselfe to his sword, he made such hauocke of his foes, that no man durst approch within ye compas of his reach: the Cittizens wondering at his chiualry, the Panims amazed at his prowes: imagining him rather to be an infernal spirit, then a liuing man. So that both through the campe of the enemy, and within the walles of the Citty: there was no speach but of the puizaunce of Blanchadine.
               
               Then began the lamentable complaint, and hydious outcries in the enemies campe, which caused the Quéene of Tormada

                   to

come with her Nurse to the window. And espied Blanchardine he haue himselfe so manfully and with such derterity suppresse her enemies, she demaunded of her Nurse who the same might be, for in all my life (quoth she) I haue not seene a knight of more value: Replyed the Nurse, truely madame I knowe not who that might be, but in my opinion hee is the brauest man at armes liuing in the world: the Queene & her Nurse communing thus together of the heroyicke fates of Blanchardine, A squire chauncing to approch néere them, spake in this manner (most sacred princesse) sée you yonder knight, whose horse is couered with white, & the blacke scar
                     •…
                  e in his helmet▪ he (I say) is the flowre of chiualrie, the subduer and vanquisher of your foes: he it is, that not satisfied with their slaughters, pursues them euen to their pauillions, and where (euen now) his armes and armor were white, they are disteyned with the blood of your enemies, whome he hath most manfully slaine. Know madame for a truth it is that knight that lodgeth in the Prouosts house, who lately subdued and vanquished the prouost.
               When the proud Lady in loue, vnderstood that it was Blanchardin
                        •…

                  on collour flusht in her face for ioy, which the wiely Nurse quickely perceiued, but the Quéene made no outwarde semblance of any such loue at all, as she inwardly bare to Blanchardine, fearing the Iealosie of her Nurse. But the fearfull Nurse séeing the great hostes of the enemy, and the continuall daunger of the cittizens, perswaded the Queene so much as she could, to pacifie those braules, by the marriage of King Alimodes. But the Quéene answered, desist for shame these foolish perswasions, for while I liue I vow to God aboue neuer to marry Panim or infidel.
               In this their secret parly, looking out of the window, they perceiued the knight still encountering one an other manfully: but aboue all, Blanchardine bore away the prize, both for magnanimitie and courage, wherefore the enemy was most d

                  ntes for that time.
               
                  Blanchardine entring the Citty, was in all triumph conu
                     •…
                  ied to the Prouosts house, with the assotiation of all the nobles of Tormaday, reuerencing him, 
                     •…
                  or his excéeding valure that day. And in truth they all had great reason so to do, because he rescued many from the foe, which otherwise had gone prisoners away with Alimodes.
               
               When he was come to the Prouosts house, the two beautifull daughters of the Prouost welcomed him with all duety: when Supper was ready, diuers nobles accompanied him, with Ladies and Gentle women from all parts of the Citty, to salute and vew Blanchardine: neither wanted there any pleasure that might procure his delight, for the Prouost had caused all the finest musitions, to attend there the supper time.
               Now the proud Lady in loue faire Eglantine leaning in her chamber window, heard the great noyes and the delicate musicke, which at that time was in the Prouosts house, for the entertainment of Blanchardine, which she her selfe did so much affectionate. But (Iealosie the Nurse of debate, and vnderminer of all happines) creapt into the heart of the Quéene, 
                     •…
                  earing least he should be enamored of one of the Prouosts daughters, whome she had heard commended for surpassing beautifull. Now care, with feare, the handmaydes of loue créept into the heart of the Princesse, soliciting her to desolue this affection (if any were) betwene Blanchardine and the Prouosts daughter. But not long after, Cupid entending a speedy reuenge for her obstinacy against his lawes, suddenly strooke her with his golden shaft, that shée became so impatient of her greifes, that day nor night shée could take any rest. Then came shee to her Nurse wyth this complaint.
               Ah swéet Nurse, now am I (vnfortunate Lady,) become the most miserablest woman liuing: thou séest, that neither day nor night I feele content or quiet, and my desease is almost incurable being sprung of passions coniealed in my heart.
               
                  Her Nurse perceiuing that her Lady was now entred the Chapter house of loue, thinking the Idole whome shee honored had béen

               The Quéene made her no answere, but to her selfe shee said ah loue, thou in very déed art the only Tirant, whome though I haue long withstood, yet now at the time when I least suspected thou hast taken me prisoner, and vnlesse I possesse the thing I loue, I dye.

                  The Queene surprized with loue and Iellosie, sendeth for the Prouost to speake with him concerning Blanchardine and the prouosts daughter.
               
               
                  AS soone as the Nurse perceiued that loue began to encamp himselfe in her tender brest, she very iocond for this happy euent, thinking it had béen with Alimodes (as I said before) began with the Quéene in this sort: Madame this is the most sacred and happyest day, that euer

               The Quéene giuing an attentiue care to vnderstand the effect

of her tale, and at last perceiuing it to tend to the marriage of the Pagan, she forgetting her wonted patience brake into these agonies: why how now Nurse, whats the cause that you continually perseuer in these vndiscreate and vnaduised termes? haue I not euer tolde thée (and withall, hast thou not heard me vow) that while breath remaineth in my body, I will neuer consent to hisloue, whose diuelish religion, ful of idolatry, & cursed apostata forbiddes me once to name much lesse to like, yea and altogether to loath? Leaue off I say these booteles intisements sith they are not available: for I tell thée, the man whome I haue sworne to loue, is the true patterne, and Prince of Magnanimity, whose braue attempts, deserue a thousand times a better woman then my selfe, [and but he] none shall enioy my loue. The Nurse Nipt with this reply of the Quéene, wist not what to coniecture of her loue, vnlesse it should be with Blanchardine, whose commendations she heard most aptly related not a little before: wher fore she thought best to be silent vntill shée knew the certainty thereof.
               Then forthwith the Quéene commaunded that the Prouost should be sent for to talke with her about some serious busines.
               The Nurse vndertaking the charge, presently dispatched a messenger, to commaund the Prouost to attend the Quéenes pleasure, which hee with all dilligence obeyed. And no sooner came, but the Quéene conueyed him vp into her gallery where entering parley with him, she began in this sort.
               Know Gentle Prouost, that these wars haue bred in me such heuines, that I cannot ioy: And yet I heare there is a knight that lodgeth in your house, whose valiancy hath wonne him such renowne throughout all the Citty, that both old and young commend his chiualry: and my selfe a beholder of his valure, thinke that his seruice hath done me such honor, as while I liue I will acknowledge my selfe thankefull to him.
               The Prouost much contented with this fréendly fauour of her Maiestie, and more to heare her so blazon the perfections of his guest Blanchardine, was rauished with excéeding ioy. And not slack to augment the praises of his fréend, (and one whom duety had tyed him vnto) pursued his commendation in this sort.
               
                  Most Magificent Princesse, since it hath pleased you to extoll the rare perfections of my princely guest, know madam, that the man liueth not in the world, whose haughty courage can equalize his, whose affable and gentle nature, deserueth commendation through out the world, and by my selfe most gratious Lady, well approued. The Lady, whose Itching eares, were neuer satisfied with his commendation answered the Prouost.
               Hauing euer found you a most trusty and louing seruant vnto vs in all affaires, wherein we haue had any cause to imploy you, hath giuen me occasion to discouer a thing vnto you which much tormenteth me to conceile, know then, that report hath told me that one of your daughters, (more forward then maidenly or modesty would) is fallen into an extreame desire and longing to be wedded to the Knight your guest, whose valures do shew him to be extracted, and descended of Princely linage. A match of disperagement, in my opinion much disagréeing both his and her estate, and of all who are acquainted therewith much discommended, therefore I charge you as you tender our fauour: presently breake off these suspitions, if you meane to continue our Princely grace towards you.
               Madam answered the Prouost, this thing is most strange vnto me, for neuer (as yet) could I so much as imagine any such accedent, neither hath any report bruted it in my eares: But yf my daughter should happen on such a knight as is Blanchardine, she might boldly vaunt, that no Lady in the world could wish a more happy content. For madam (quoth he) he hath this day, by his owne proper valure, subdued and taken ten knights prisoners, besides their braue coursers, which he hath bestowed vpon your Lords and Nobles. And to be short, I rather take him to be Oberon, king of the Fairies, then a mortall or human creature: well then (quoth the Quéene) being right glad to heare his prayses so extolled by the Prouost, percha
                     •…
                  ce I know the man better then you imagine, and am most wel acquainted with the daughter of a king, who for ornaments of nature, and admirable beauty, hath not her paragon, and whose ardent affection, and continuall thoughts, do dayly and hourely wander vppon his rare perfections, and it may be that for loue of her▪ he hath vndertaken

these aduentures: therefore it were a monstrous folly and deepe absurdity in your daughter, to carry such an ouerwéening of her selfe, as to imagine that she were a match worthye of such a paramour: therefore (as you regarde my displeasure) haue secret, yet speciall care, of the wanton glaunces and familiar unbracements of your daughter with that yong knight: and yet because you shall not thinke that I compact this, to preiudice or hinder the preferments of your daughters, send them spéedily to my Court, to attend on my person, where for your seruice, and their owne sakes, I will prouide them husbands, to your & their contents, neither shall they néede any cost or dowry from you.
               The prouost most humbly thanking her Maiestie for this her princely offer, for the preferment of his daughters, promised for euer all obseruance and duety to her highnes: but when he was ready to departe, the Quéene commaunded him that hee should bring the said Knight the next morning to her presence, where she might first by her speech and countenance, and after by liberall rewardes, requite the honourable attempts he had vndertaken in her quarrell, because (quoth she) by his onely ayde and valour, our warres doe sorte to happie end. In consideration whereof, if hee please hee shall be affianced and wedded to that Kings daughter, which so much delighteth in his person: which if he shall deny, reporte from me vnto him, that it were most vnciuill and inhumaine, to refuse that proffer, which diuers Lords and Princes would hazard liues and liuings to attaine: but (on my honor) the cause why thus I will importune him in the behalfe of this Lady, is for that she is néere allied vnto my selfe, and with whose affection I am throughly acquainted, because that day and night she doth languish for his loue, whose presence and yea, will be a heauen: and whose absence and deniall, a hell vnto her: and her cars is as gréeuous vnto me, as (if it were mine owne) and would confound my heart with sorrowe, to see this Lady forsaken, cast of by him, and frustrated of her hope.
            
            
               
               Chap. 15.
               
                  How Blanchardine was enformed by the Prouost, of the Queenes pleasure to haue him attend on her maiesty the next morning, and of the speech she had with him.
               
               
                  AFter that the Prouost was returned home to his house, he calling Blanchardine▪
                   recounted the Quéens message vnto him, that on the next morning he shuld attend her maiesties pleasure at the Court, to conferre with the Quéene and receiue a recompence for his vallourous attempts in her highnesse seruice: and withall forgat not to explaine vnto him the loue of the Kings daughter, which did so intirely affectionate him, that for his loue she would hazard life and all, so she might obtaine the effect of her hope, and (quoth the Prouost) if my opinion deceiue me not, she her selfe is the Kings Daughter, which longeth to be shrined for a saint within the aulter of your hart, and yet because she hath euer béene at defiance with loue, I cannot coniecture, but greatly wonder, whether it should be she or no: but, if the praiers which I doe poure forth vnto the Gods, might be auaylable for the consummating of your marriage with the Quéene, I would day and night entreat the heauenlye powers to sorte my wish to happy effect.
               When the Prouost had discoursed at large, of the Quéenes commaund vnto Blanchardine, hee smiling at his happy fortune, made this reply▪ Prouost (quoth he) it rather seemeth that you deuise this forged tale, then deliuer the Queenes message: for her maiestie neuer in her life had any conference with me: how then can I imagine that her affection should be such towardes me, as you speake of? but I rather coniecture her maiestie doth delude me, and smally respect my seruice (which if I thought) I would not stay to offend her highnes. Ah good sir (quoth the Prouost)

take not in ill part what I haue saide, for vpon the faith I doe owe to your selfe, it is most true: therefore let vs in the morning goe to the Court, that her maiestye may perceiue that I haue done her commaund, which if you finde contrary, neuer haue affiance nor truth in me againe.
               With these and such like speech, Blanchardine and the Prouost went to the Court, where the Quéene (then in counsell with her Lords about the warres) séeing Rlanchardine and the Prouost enter the presence, arofe to welcome them: and with attention casting her eyes on Blanchardine, commended within her selfe, the rare perfection both of beauty and courage she perceiued in him, yet loth to make manifest what she intended to keep most secret, did bridle affection for the time.
               The Ladies and Gentlewomen there present, wondered at the admirable proportion of his body, & singularity of his beauty, hauing heard of the dexteritie of armes, which he manfully perfourmed in the warres before the Cittie of Tormaday.
               
               But Blanchardine was so intangled in the lyme bushe of the Quéenes beauty, that he thought (if Paris had then liued) and that 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                     
                   should againe cast downe the golden ball amid the thrée Goddesses vpon the the toppe of Jda, that if so be this Quéene had but once made she we of her selfe, hee would haue cleane dismissed them all, and bestowed the ball on her.
               But at length the Quéene breaking silence, tooke Blanchardine by the hand, requesting him to sit down by her, which he rather for manners (then vnwillingnes) refused, till at the last by meere constraint, after most humble reuerence he obeyed.
               Then the Quéene after long deliberation, said vnto him: Sir Knight, your comming into this Cittie, hath béene much to our comfort and aduauncement, for which we humblye thanke the Gods: but for the most valiant prowes you haue shewed, in confounding our aduersaries, we gratifie you with all kindenes, and will rewarde you most honourably.
               Madame, replied Blanchardine, I finde my selfe more honoured, then either my deserts haue giuen cause▪ or my hart can desire, in that you vouchsafe to grace me in this honourable assembly: and what I haue atchieued, hath bene through the omnipotencie

of God, who sent me hether to doe you seruice. Know most excellent Queene, since I forsooke my parents, country and fréends, I neuer tooke greater contentment, then in such seruices as it shal please your Maiestie to cōmaund, and for the rewards which your Maiesty offereth vnto me, I most humblye beseech your highnes to bestow them on my Host, whose kindenesse hath bene more towards me since my arriuall here, then my abilitye (as yet) can require: and if it may please your maiestie to entertaine a wandring Knight into your princely seruice, I shall doe my deuoire to perfourme the trust you shall repose in me.
               Herewith the Queene marking the debonaire countenance of Blanchardine, shee was so rauished in contemplation of his beauty, that almost distraught of her sences, he might well perceiue that loue had made her his votary.
               
                  Blanchardine taking holde of occasion: emboldned himselfe to demaund of her Maiestie, what Lady that might be of whome she had tolde the Prouost the day before.
               Then answered the Quéene, she of whome I made mencion to your Host, is neerely allied vnto my selfe, whose welfare I tender as my owne.
               As Madame, quoth Blanchardine, if I might presume so farre, as be inquisitiue to know her name, your maiestie should greatly pleasure me: for on my life in all my daies I neuer conceiued liking of any Lady but one, whose princely beauty [pardō me oh gratious Princesse] made me presume to steale a kisse of her maiestie, which kisse hath added both such will and force to my minde & body, that whilest I breathe this ayre, Ile liue to serue, and dye to honour her, and onely in her remaineth my life or death.
               Then replyed the Queene, wel gentle knight, because I cannot longer conceale affection, and that I féele my hart so esprized with this swéete conference which now I haue with you (al circumstance laid aparte) I am constrained to manifest my loue: Know therfore, that whatsoeuer I spake vnto the Prouost concerning any Lady, my selfe am the same, whom neither time nor age can make to forget your noble and curteous demea

but Blanchardine, yet haue I appealed to the high heauens, & put in my plea agai ast the God of loue, but my action is nought worth.
               Imagine gent. that this her confession to her ghostly father Blanchar was not without change of coulour, and withall, that his reply was without feruent zeale and deuotion, in harkening to the gladsome doome of his continuall weale, proceeding from the Oracle of his desire, and withall that besides thēselues, none was priuy to this conference at that time.

                  AFter that the Quéene and Blanchardine had thus plighted their promises ech to other, and that the Quéene was about to departe, the Prouost entreated him to returne home, because it was about supper time: which the Queen espying, commaunded the Prouost presently to send his daughters to the Court, and vpon her crowne she would richly marry them: I will not say that ielousie was the occasion heereof, but I leaue that to the censure of grauer heads then mine.
               But fréendly pacing Home ward, the Prouost desirous to know the sequell of Blanchardines cause, and the confereuce in secret he had with the Quéene, coniured him of all loues to vnfold the circumstance, promising vpon his life both secrecie and coustancie, for my mind (quoth he) cannot be satisfied, vntill I knowe whether you shall be King of Tormayday or no, being more then halfe perswaded therunto already.
               
                  Blanchardine reposing an assured trust in the Prouost, by reason of many fauours which he had receiued from him, from point to point, related ye whole procéedings, betwixt the Quéene and him selfe, requiring his secrecy as in such a case is needfull.
               No soner were they entred the Prouost house, but the Quéene

                  diatly sent vnto Banchardine a rich white courser, sumptuously trapped with crimson veluet and gold, and withall a sleeue of her gowne richly imbrodered with pearle, which she mioyned him by her messenger to weare vpon his

                  , when he should encounter with her enemies, that thereby she might the better perceiue him from the other Lords.
               
                  Blanchardine in all humility receiued this princely present▪ and royally thanking her maiestie for so high a fauour, gaue in reward vnto the bringer an ouch of golde, vpon which was set a rich ruby incompassed wt diamonds, who thanking Blanchardine most humbly, departed: and being returned to the Queene, recounted the thankfull acceptance of the present by Blanchardine, and the bountifull reward he receiued from him for his paines, which the Lady reioycing to heare, commending the honorable minde of Blanchardine, imagining that such liberality could not issue from a base courage.
               But presently a great clamor was in the streates, which put the Prouost into a sodain admiration of the cause: anon it was related vnto them, that the king of the giants called Rubion, was before the walles of the towne, demaunding iustes▪ for his Ladyes sake, daughter to king Alimodes, who had h

               This vnexpected newes much delighted Blanchardine, who requested nothing more then to vndertake this combate, in honor of his Lady, whose fleeue he bare: and least the Giant should be gon, before he could be ready for the fight, he sent present word that the Giant should not loose his labour, and that his request should be fulfilled. These newes séemed to reuiue the heart and courage of Rubior, because he longed to shew his valure, for the loue of Alimodes daughter his Lady and mistresse.
               Long stayed not Blanchardine, till he mounted his horse armed, and on his Helmet he wa

the Ladyes, Lords, and Cittizens wondered at the haughty courage of Blanchardine, much commending his generosity & braue carriage on horsebacke: And all praiers were made, for his safe returne.
               Thus marched he out of the gates, and came to the place where the Giant stayed his comming: whome when the Giant beheld, he sternly demaunded of whence he was, and what vnaduised chaunce had brought him thither? Blanchardine answered, I will not for any dread of thée (accursed miscriant) conceile my name nor parentage: know, I am sonne to the King of Frize my name is Blanchardine, sent to combate with thée, by my gratious and most faire Princesse Eglantine, Quéene of Tormaday surnamed the proude Lady in loue.
               And (quoth the Giant) I euen now was commaunded from my péereles Lady and mistresse, the daughter to the king Alimodes, who gaue me this her right sléeue for my fauour, that this enfigne of her fauor couering my head, I may accomplish some exploite beséenring the beauty of my loue.
               Then quoth Blanchardine, Panim do thy worst, I am heare to answere thée, so much as thou shalt demaund.
               So fetching their carreirs, they encountered the one the other with such haughtie courage, that both their launces shiuered to their handes: Then betaking themselues to their swordes, their strokes were so terrible, that the fire flue out of their helmets, and for a while the fierce fight remained doubtfull.
               Nowe was the Quéene of Tormayday ascended her gallery window whence the might behold the combatants, and fearing much (by reason of the hugenes of ye Giant) ye 
                  Blanchardine would not returne againe safe, she becamepensiue, and very sorrowfull.
               On the other side sate king Alimodes daughter, to behold her champion, but casting her eyes vpon Blanchardine, wishing in her heart that he might be conquerer, she might haue him for her paramour.
               But this doubtfull fight was at length finished by Blanchadine, who casting his eyes to the window where his louely Quéene lay, his courage augmenting by the vertue he drew from her: vppon the sudden, hee lent the Giant such a cuff, that hee tumbled

downe from his horse in a sound: which when Blanchardine perceiued, he thought to allight to finish the r

                  mbate, by cutting off his head, when out of an ambosh issued thrée score Pagans for his rescue.
               The Quéene of Tormaday, séeing this treachery, charged her men presently to post out of the towne to ayde Blanchardine. But before they could come▪ 
                  Blanchardine was encompassed with twenty men, of the which none came within his reach but wished he had not attempted so néere him.
               The Quéenes soldiers cōming to the rescue, were encountred by fresh supplies of the Pagans, so that that day was much bloodshed▪ and had béen the last day of Alimodes seidge had not Darias his sonne su

                  cored his fainting Knights, with new supplyes.
               
                  Darias being come, sounded a retreat to his men for a while, then ioyning together his companies againe, inuaded the thickest of the Cittizens, and no doubt had done great slaughter that day, had not Blanchardine singled himforth, who in the counterbuff, gaue him such a bastinado, that made him sincke to the ground out of his saddle, and had not present succour come, he had seuered his head from his shoulders.
               
                  Darias being thus rescued, was conueied home to his pauillion, where by reason of the stroke, he was constreined to kéep his bed thrée dayes.
               In this time Rubion the Giant, hauing recouered both his sences and his horse againe, did great exploites, and had almost slaine the Prouost, had not Blanchardine made spéedy hast, calling vppon the Giant: Ah thou false Panim (quoth he) this shalbe thy last day, thou which most traiterously wouldest haue slain me, & by that meanes hast once escaped my hands: Now will I take such vēgeance on thee, thou shall neuer see thy Lady again: And here withall, aduauncing himselfe, gaue him such a sound buffet on the helmet, that he fell downe starke dead to the earth.
               The death of the Giant Rubion King of the Sarizens, once bruted, all his soldiers being discomforted, made hast to recouer their pauilions and tentes. But being pursued with all celerity that might be, were cut off by the way before they coulde reach thi▪ther.

                  Blanchardine followed so hard, that he came euen to the entry of Alimodes pauilion, before the which he found the kings daughter sitting to beholde the battell, whom when Blanchardine espyed, he bowing himselfe downe, tooke vp the Damosell, and set her before him on his courser, and posted as fast as hee could to Tormaday.
               
               
                  Alimodes hearing of this hard aduenture, as a man desperate and halfe frantick, posted after with foure thousand souldiers, to recouer his daughter againe: and one making more spéed then auailed him, comming some what néerer Blanchardine, was presently slaine by him: but in this staye the enemy rushed so fast vpon him, that Blanchardines horse was slaine vnder him: but he trusting in God, so behaued himselfe with his shielde and sworde, that not the prowdest Sarasin durst approch him.
               When the King Alimodes perceiued the great prowes that remained in Blanchardine, that among so many, none durst encounter him, he cryed out amaine vnto his Knights. Fye on you all, vntrue and faintharted Pagans, that one Knight is able to affright so many: with these vpbraidings, the vnruely rabble of rascall Sarizens ranne all at once desperately vpon Blanchardine, and so surprised him by maine force: but in his taking, hee slew among many others, a Knight that was Nephew to Alimodes▪
                   a man of great accompt and prowes.
               In good time Beautrix the daughter of King Alimodes, hauing wisely perused the excellent beauty of Blanchardine, seeing the likelyhoode of his present death, prostrated her selfe vpon her knees vnto the king her father, humbly requesting him to pardon the life of the yong Knight.
               The King beholding the pittifull demaund of his daughter, whome aboue all creatures in the world he loued, answered her in this wise.
               My déere and welbeloued daughter, I wishe it had not béene your chaunce at this time to haue béene present, or I would you had not entreated for him who hath done vs all this domage, but since it is your demaund, and that I cannot deny what you request, he shall not dye héere, but I will presentlye send him away vnto the Realme of Salmandry, vnto the King of Giants,

brother to Rubion whome he hath ssaine, and whome I tendered as my owne person, who (if he had liued) had béene your espouse and husband.
               But the Quéene of Tormadar, vnderstanding of the great distresse wherein Blanchardine was, commaunded the Prouost presently to post, and ransome him, how soeuer. But the King made the more expedition and hast to send him away to Salmandry, that there with all cruelty, he might be massacred, swearing by his Mahomet, that no ransome should set him free, but death.
               The Prouost hearing this absolute, and resolute answere of Alimodes, reported to Blanchardine the desperate estate he now was in, whereof Blanchardine was not a little sorry, but finding no remedy willed him most humbly to commend him to the good grace of the Quéene.
               When the Prouost was returned home, and now was entred the court, he found the Quéene out of measure sorrowful, sor the losse and absence of Blanchardine, vnto whome he made a true report according to the answere of Alimodes, which vncomfortable message, did so daunt the heart of the Quéene, that euery one expected her present death. But leauing her in her pasions, returne we to Alimodes.

                  AFter the departure of the Prouost, Alimodes commaunded his sonne Darius to returne to Cassidony where hee was king and to carry with him his sister Beautrix. And in his absence, gouerne the land and people in quiet, whilst his seidge lay against Tormaday: And like wise deliuerred

vnto his custody Blanchardine, whome be charged to send into Salmandry to the king of Giants, whose brother Blanchardine had lately slaine, there to be tortured to death at the discreation of the king. Darius presently at the commaund of his father, rigged two ships for his passage, in the one he and his faire sister Beautrix, in the other Blanchardine garded by thrée score men was put.
               When all things were in a readines for their departure, the marriners weighing ancor and hoysing sayle, floted away. So Blanchardine, finding no remorse, like a lamb to the slaughter, was carried towards Cassidony and as he imagined to his death.

               When Blanchardine, looking backe into the extreame daunger he had escaped, humbly knéeling gaue thanks to God, and so traueling along the vnknowne country vntill he came within the kenning of the Citty of Marrienburgh: in which Citty, as a Country swayne that he met, told him, there lay a mighty King who on the next day, had appointed agreat tilting and triumph, commaunding all his nobles (able to beare armes) not to fayle to be there, as that day, to try their valures and chiualries.
               
                  Blanchardine (whose education be seemed a princes sonne) prouiding himselfe of other apparel: & hauing good skyll in their language, demaunded ye rediest way to the court, of such passengers as he met. And hasting his pace, because he would come in some good time, at length he approched the court. And entring within the Hall he found the king conferring with the Barons about the next dayes sportes. Blanchardine beholding his maiestie and magnificent estate prostrated himselfe on his knée before him. The king vewing the manlike grace of blanchardine, demaunded what he was, to whome blanchardine most reuerently made answere, that he was a far country man borne, and vndertaking this inquest, to come and serue his maiestie, whose princely

fame spreding through the world, chaunced to fly into Créece to my fathers court, a king in that Country. And séeing that noe newes of wars néere at hand, was as then stirring: I with thréescore gentlemen and soldiers imbarqued our selues for your seruice. But being at Sea, a huge tempest rising from the nore, after our trauel in long daunger, our Ship strooke vpon a rocke so yt it sylyt in twain, and all the rest of my cōpany were drownd sauing my selfe, whome by the helpe of a péece of our mast, fortune preserued, and was brought to shore, not far from the castle Mocaster, within your highnes Dominions, from whence I haue by many dayes iourney traueled hither.
               Fayre Knight (quoth the King) your case is strange. But your ariuall here most welcome, and since you haue for our seruice vndertaken so dangerous a vioage and escaped so perilous aduentures, and withall being the Sonne of a king, I may not (vnlesse I should blot that fame with shamefull reproch (which you say) is spred abrode of our magnanimity) but recompence your paines accordingly.
               Know therefore sir knight, that at this instant, I haue wars newly begun, with one of my neighbour kings, yet that I may inuest you with the honor you deserue, I will make you general of all my sorces there, wherein if god shall prosper your attempts and chiualry, doubt not but I will so amplyreward your seruice, that you shall not after, haue cause to complaine you of our liberality. And in the meane I will take such order, that all things conuenient for your estate shalbe foorthwith prouided.

                  This princely charge of the king did so glad Blanchardine, that more happie newes he could not receiue (except it were from his Lady Eglantine Quéene of Tormaday) wherefore he thanked the King most humbly, promising all forwardnes of a knight.
               Then forthwith the kings letters were directed for the mustering of men, which by the next morning were ready appointed at the Citte Marienbourgh, to goe vnder the conduct of Blanchardine, against the Polanders.
               
               
                  Blanchardine most royally accepted his charge, and forthwith accompanied with Sadony the Kings sonne, emarched forwarde against the enemy, whome ere long they escryed vpon the side of a hill. Blanchardine raunged his men into sundry squadrons, and in the formost put himselfe, and in the middle the Kinges sonne Sadony. Thus in order of battle they assayled the enemy, vpon whose incounter, the clamor grew excéeding great, the ordinaunces played, the muskets discharged pelmell vpon their aduersaries, so that with in short time, the grownd was couered with dead carcasses. Now Blanchardine espying the huge courage of the king of Polandes Brother, whose valure, séemed to quaile the heartes of his men: with his launce encountred him, and vpon the shock, ran him cleane through the body, so that hée fell from his horse dead: vpon this heauy spectacle, the Polanders (being dis

                  aid) retired towards the kings standerd, and enformed him of the successe of his brother: the King wroth beyond measure, sware that he would neuer giue ouer the fight, till he had reuenged his brothers death, and in this outragious fury he thrust himselfe in the middle of his foes. Then began the battle to be most fierce: for now Sadony séeing the enemy somwhat disordered, gaue a fresh charge vpon them, at whose approch, the thundring noyse of the horsemen, made the grownd to eccho. But Sadony and his company, séeing the great prowes of Blanchardine, whose launce before it brake, had slaine at the least twenty of his foes, they imagined him rather a spirite, then a humane creature.

                  ounted the king from his horse, whome so soone as he sawe vnhorsed, he presently allighted, minding to take his head in gadge for his whole body, but the king séeing himselfe frustate of all hope of rescue, deliuered his sword to Blanchardine yeilding himselfe his prisoner: blanchardine forthwith committed him to the custody of ten Knights, to be conueyed presently out of the camp, and safely to be garded till he might make a present of him to the king.
               When the Polanders perceiued their king taken prisoner, they began to be discomforted, and foorthwith betook themselues to fight: but being pursued by their enemies, few or none of them escaped: blanhardine deuided all the spoyle among his soldiers, whereby he wonne the hearts of all his soldiers.
               After Blanchardine had put to flight his foes, and had established a quiet peace in those parts, he & the prince Sadony, repaired to the King at Marienbourgh, where with all honor, hee deliuered the king of Poland into the hands of his maiestie, to vse according to his pleasure.
               The King most gratefully accepted this present of him, and hearing the generall report of all, in the great commendation of Blanchardine, and that by his onely meanes his enemies were subdued: imbracing him with an extraordinary salutation spake in this manner.
               Most braue and heroicke knight, your noble attempts giue manifest proofe of your high extraction, and princely parentage: and for my owne part, not hauing wherewith worthyly to recompence your great desertes, I doe submit both my selfe, my Sonne, and may realme to bée at your commaunde and vasselage.
               Answered Blanchardine, this vndeserued honor, which you of your fauour assigne vnto me, neyther befitteth my calling, nor my nature. But (if it may please your Maiestye) to accept of mée, as one among the number of these gallant knights, to attend your highnes, I shall thinke my selfe most amply honored.

Nay quoth the king, your demaund is too reasonable. But I haue a maiden néece of mine, whose beauty far surpasseth all the Ladies in this Land, whome (if you please to wed) I will bestow vpon you, with such a royall dowry that you shall thinke, though my powre be not so great as I wish to satis

                  Blanchardine humbly thanking his maiestie, answered him in this sort, most mighty king, pardon me, although I shal make refusall of this your princely offer, for know, that in my owne country of Gre

                  lond Father to Blanchardine, according to his accustomed vsage, twise or thrise in the yéere, made his progresse to the said Iland both for the pleasure he found there, in sundry pastimes fit for a Princes disport, and also at that time to take truce with sorrow, which hee had so long time warred with, for the absence of his sonne Blanchardine, of whome since his departure, he neuer had any certaine tidings, during whose infortunate abode in this aforesaid Iland, these miscreants Darius and his company cam

                   a shore there: and hauing in their march, apprehended thrée of the inhabitants, demaunded of them to whome the said Iland might belong, and withall, what Gods they worshipped? these poore men seeing the excéeding number of these Pagans, (cōpelled through feare of their liues) discouered the whole estate of the Iland, their faith in Iesus Christ, and withall, the presence of the King of Frize at that instant, the which report once bruted to Darias and the rest of his diuilish company, they foorthwith posted forward, in most secret manner to the Castel, where the king then lay. And vpon their approch beseidged the same, and tooke the king and all his company prisoners, whome they incontinently caused to be carried aboorde their ships.
               After this, searching farther into the Iland, they with fire and sworde, wasted and destroyed all the inhabitants, and houses there, and driuing all the cattel they could find towardes their ships, furnished themselues with fresh victuals to present to his father Alimodes, and his company lying in the seidge before Tor maday, with all fearing their scarcety: Which being accomplisht according to the commaund of Darius, he and all his company with the king of Frize and diuers of his Lords and Gentlemen, whome they had there vnawares surprised, bent their course to Tormaday.
               
               But when the vncomfortable tidings of this sudden mischance came to the hearing of the Quéene of Frize what acclamations and pittyful complaintes she made, are impossible for me to write and more difficult to recount. But in these agonyes, what with her neuer dying care and thought for Blanchardine her sonne, and for the losse of her husband, shee yelded her selfe to God and dyed.

                  Darius being come a shore within the country of Tormaday 
                  
                     〈◊〉
                   hauing vnshipt all his prouision, which he had brought fro

                   foresaid Iland, presently dispatched messengers to his father, 
                     〈◊〉
                   enforme him of his happy ariuall, which he no soner heard, but in all post, he went to meete and welcome his sonne.
               And then began Darius to recount vnto his fa

                  om the King nor news of the thréescore men that went with him.
               Then Darius presented to his father, the king of Frize, as his prisoner, and the ritch booty which he had taken in the Iland, and brought thither for their supply of victualls, which vnexpected happy present, to cheered vp the heartes of the Soldiers, and so pleased the king his father, that his welcome to all was more like a God then a man.
               Now Darius being come to his fathers tent, he demaunded of him how the Quéene of Tormaday, and all her Lords had (since his departure) behaued themselues, and also what store of provision he thought to remaine within the Citty, and how often they had made Issue out to skirmish with his people?
               
                  Alimodes made answere, that hée made no doubt but that shortly they would deliuer, both the Queene, the towne, and themselues into his handes, by reason of their great want of victuals.
               And besides (quoth he) they haue not made any issue out, but once since the departure of the young knight, which I sent with you prisoner to Salmandri

also to comfort his sister Beautrix, whom he had left Vicegerent till his returne.
               So the time for his departure beeing come, the King with all his Nobles, Captaines, and cheefe of accompt, leauing their tents, accompanied Darius to the sea side, to take their leaues on ship boo

                  d. In the meane time, the Prouost of Tormaday now being vpon the walls of the towne, and both by his owne view, and by the report of his espialls, perceiuing the exceeding number of cattell lately brought thether by Darius▪
                   and pastured not farre from the Citie. And hearing of the departure of All modes and all his Captaines, for the conduct of Darius to the sea. Calling the Nobles and principall Commanders of Tormaday, discoursed at large thus much vnto them: That considering the rich bootie they should obtaine, and the penurie which they indured by the want of victuall in the Towne, hee would haue a generall issue in the absence of the enemie at seuerall posternes, both to recouer the cattle before the Towne, and also to surprize at vnawares and vnprouided the enemy, remaining within the tents of Allimodes.
               
               The Quéene and her Lords weighing the sage aduice of the manly Prouost, gaue consent to effect what hee had determined with all celeritie, both time and opportunitie being so agreeable to their enterprise.
               Forthwith the Prouost, taking with him a sufficient companie of couragious Souldiers and trustie men at Armes, marched out at the principal gate of the citie, where the Enemy might soonest esp

                  e and discouer them: the rather to entice the soe to forsake their tents, and come against them. At certaine other Posternes priuely issued out at the least sixe thousand horse and foote to make seazure on the cattell, which at that instant were most 
                     〈◊〉
                   garded, by reason of the absence of the captaines & keepers, which were gone with Darius to the sea side. So that without anie force at all, they within small time had driuen the cattell within the walls of Tormaday: and the rest of the citizens (hauing surprised the Enemie in the tents) put most to the sword and taking such pillage as they found, set fire on the rest, and forthwith returned safe to the citie, leading with them such

prisoners of accompt, as fortune had reserued from the slaughter.
               Being now come within the citie walls, after giuing most humble thankes to God for this happie conquest, making suruey of the bootie they had gotten, they found it excéeding rich, and besides the proye of cattell was sufficient to maintaine them the space of a yere: which bred a swéete content to the Quéene and her Nobles, and a generall comfort to all the Inhabitaunts of Tormaday.
               
               But when Allimodes and his companie were returned from sea, and found the sodaine slaughter of his men, the burning and spoyling of his tents, rape of his goods, and besides (which he accompted worst of all) the losse of the cattell, hee grewe as a man desperate, and halfe beside his senses, cursing and exclaiming vpon his Gods, that so vniustly (as he thought) had depriued him of all his happines at once. And in these outrages let him remaine a little.

cannot send a greater plague. Therefore make all possible spéede you can, to rigge and furnish a ship, with men, munition, and vittuals, for your selfe and your company, that withal secretie, and without the priuitie of our foes, you may both passe and returne againe: herein you shall not only discharge the duty of a trusty subiect, but also perfourme the part of a true fréend, and for euer bind me to your valiancie and forwardnes.
               Madam replyed the Prouost, I most humbly thanke your maiestie, for this honor wherewith you seeme at this time to grace mée, and here I vow vpon my faith, duety to God and allegeance to your highnes, to performe (or els to dye) the full of your commaund, with all the possible speede I may.
               The Prouost hauing made all requisite and necessary prouision, departed earely out at a little posterne, with his companny: and long before day, embarqued himselfe for Norweigh. But so soone as Appillo had forsaken Thetis bed, mounted his fyerye chariote: the spialls of Alimodes, had escryed the ship wherein the Prouost went twenty Leages off the shore, whereof he being aduertised, grew excéeding wrath: but seeing no remedy, he besought his Gods that his sonne Darius might encounter him on the seas, and so stay his iorney, in which hope hee somwhat recomforted himselfe. But Darius taking a contrary course, landed shortly within the territories of Cassadony, where being come a shore, he commaunded that the king of Frize, and those prisoners that they had brought, should be shut vp in most lothsome obscure stinking dungions, where the aged king spent a great part of his time, in sorrowing his distresse and hard aduenture where in he did remaine, till by his sonne Blanchardine, he was enlarged and set srée, as hereafter you shall here.

Blanchardine on a time, finding Sodony absent, about some serious busines of the king his fathers, priuily repaired to a close and delicate garden neer adioyning to the court, whither being come, hee began to meditate and call to minde) the rare perfection of Eglantine (his deere and most sweet beloued lady, Queene of Tormaday. And in this his deep and melancholike dumps, he glanced his wandering eyes, on a beautifull rose, which grew in the walke, which he so fitly applyed to the beauty of his loue, as all poets penns could not more artificially discipher it. But when he mist the substance of his Lady, whose shaddow he had so long time imprinted in his thought, his griefes did so abound, remembring her extreames, that he was like to ouercome. But calling to mind, the honorable bounty of the king of Spruse, who offered his néece to him in mariage, he brake foorth in these tearmes.
               And should I liue, so to violate the sacred othe made to my Goddes faire Eglantine, whose only thought, haue giuen so many victories, or should I once attempt any other then her selfe, who is the only soueraigne of my soule?

                  Know Sadony, that at my arriuall at Tormaday, the Panim King Allimodes, seeking perforce to win the said Quéen to grant him loue, which shee with a most discontented minde from time to time vtterly denied. This King (I say) full of rage and frenzie, intending to conquer that by fire and sword, which he could not get by flatterie, hath layd continuall siedge to the cittie Tormaday where shee is now resident, and voweth neuer to giue ouer his assault vntil he may obtaine the Queene for his Empres and wife: my selfe in her seruice at that instaunt by aduerse Fortune, was suddainely surprized, and taken prisoner by Alimodes seruants: and not vouchsafing to accept of any ransome, sent me by a strong gard of thrée score men to Salmandria to the King, there to be murdered, by reason that I in those warres before Tormaday, chaunced to slay his brother Rubion. But in our iourney by sea a gust of winde and tempest, draue our ship wherin I was vpon a rocke, so that it split in twaine, and (but my self) none escaped, chauncing to bestride a péece of the maine mast, which brought me ashore in this Countrey.
               Comfort your selfe (quoth Sadony) and although your hard aduentures, were sufficient to discourage you of all good hope, yet shall you sée, that for the singular good will I beare you, I will imploye all the industrie and paines I haue, both to release the Ladie of her imprisonment, and also to yéeld you contentment in your loue: and because I will not let slip occasion, I will presently goe to my father, and request his aide in this your enterprize: who (I know) wil not spare anie cost to effect the full of your desire.
               
                  Blanchardine perceiuing that his complaint was like to finde remedie by his frend Sadony answered thus: Most braue and valorous Gentleman, know for certaintie, that Alimodes hath a daughter named Beautrix, whose beautie is most excellent, and (in my conceipt) worthie the noblest man that liues: whom I doubt not in time (if you please) to make your Ladie and wife, if in these warres we haue successe.
               This spéech of Blanchardine, did so instigate and pricke forward Sadony, that presently hee went to his father the King of Marienbourgh, and led with him Blanchardine: who prostrating

themselues on their knées before the King, Sadony began to expostulate him in this manner.
               Most mightie King, since that by the valor and princely courag
                     •…
                   of this Knight, your Realme is in securitie, and that by him you haue the King of Poland your prisoner and in safetie: may it please your Maiestie, to shewe the magnificencie of a King, in dooing a deserued fauor to this yong Gentleman, whose extreme iniuries, proffered to the néerest of his kin at this instant, wanting spéedie helpe, are like to bréed an ouerthrow to himselfe, and all his frends for euer. Therefore most royall King and father, that strangers abroad may blazon the princely bountie of your Maiestie, let vs haue presently men and munition for this our enterprise, that our aduentures maye not onelye bee fortunate abroad, but our returne home most honorable and victorious.
               When the King had giuen attention to this tale of his sonne Sadony, considering the great bands wherein he thought himself bound to Blanchardine, and also loth to incurre the ignominious slander of his home born subiects in denying this petition, which tended for the good of Blanchardine▪
                   hee presently not onely gaue command that men should be leuied, money in readines, & ships prepared for them: but also séemed more desirous than they, for the spéedie dispatch in those affaires. And on the third day after, fourtéene thousand men were in readines, for to be shipt awaye vnder the conduct of Blanchardine and Sadony, with al things appertaining to such an hoast.
               When men and victualls were aboord, the King in person accompanied Blanchardine and his sonne to the sea side, and withall brought foure of his idolatrous golden gods, gorgeously adorned with pearle and precious stones, commending their safetie to them in their iourney.
               After the departure of the King to his Court, they weighed anchor, and hoyst vp their sayles, and by the industrie of skifull Pilots, in short time came within two dayes sayle of the Citie of Tormaday. But houering a little on the seas to escrie land, they espied a ship a kenning off, which séemed to bende her course towards Tormaday, whom anone they hayled: and comming aboord, they found within the vessel the good Prouost of Tormaday,
                  
who was returned from the kingdome of Norway, whether hée was sent from the Quéene of Tormaday, for supply of souldiers to raise the siege of Alimodes: whom when Blanchardine espied, glad beyond measure of such happie méeting, made him almost forget that euer he had sorrowed before. And demaunding of the Prouost first of his Countrey, secondly of the gouernment, and thirdly the cause of his voyage? He answered, that being sent by the Quéene of Tormaday▪
                   to procure aide from the King of Norway, to repulse Alimodes & his host, and that before his comming thether, the King was dead, so that her comfort there was vtterly quailed. Now Blanchardine perceiuing that the Prouost knew him not by reason of the colour he had depainted himselfe withall, to resemble the Countrey men of Spruce, questioned farther with the Prouost, of the Quéen and her Dominions? vnto whom the Prouost replyed. The Realme is called Dalmatia, and Tormaday is the principall place and Citie within the Realme, both for concourse of people, strength and traffique. Our Quéene is named Eglantine the faire, and by reason of her chastitie, she is surnamed, the proud Ladie in loue. And know good sir, that manie and sundrie Princes, Kings and Emperors haue continually sollicited our Quéene in marriage: but she neuer regarded their requests, by reason of a yong Knight, whom aboue all the world she loueth so tenderly, as I thinke vnles she he are some speedie newes of him, being lately taken prisoner by the King Alimodes, and sent to Cassidony from thence, to be conueighed to Salmandry to the King there: whose brother Rubion hee slew before Tormaday, shee (I saye) will neuer enioye anie felicitie or happines. Why quoth Blanchardine, thinke you not that since that yong Knight is gone, and that no tidings can bee brought to her of him, that she will accept one of vs for her husband, vpon condition we deliuer her, from the hands of king Alimodes.
               
               Ah good sir, (quoth the Prouost) I am so assured of her constancie, and inuiolable oath, which she hath plighted to that Knight, that she will neuer yeeld to any other though she should presently suffer death, and that her crowne, kingdome and people, should be for euer captiuated and ouerthrowne.
               
                  
                  Blanchardine tickled with this sugred discourse of the Prouost, finding by his tale, that none but himselfe had wonne the fort of her fancie, rounded Sadony in the eare: and tolde him that this was the Ladie, whose seruice he was bound to prosecute.
               The Prouost séeing by Blanchardines courteous salutations, that he had no need to doubt of anie villanie, demaunded secretly if these were or would conioin to the rescue of his Ladie and Mistresse, the proud Ladie in loue, against her soe and cruell enemie King Alimodes?
               
               What (quoth Blanchardine) thinke you vs so foolish, as for to venture our bodies, liues and goods, to succor her, who is so deuoted to one, whom she is vncertaine euer to see againe? Yet this I know, that womens fancies alter with euery winde, their substance is onely mutabilitie, and full of inconstancie: and therefore I maruell how you dare vndertake, that shee beeing a woman, will remaine constant to one that is either dead, or neuer like to returne to her againe aliue.
               Ha ha sir said the Prouost, if you were as priuie to her contentment in her loue to hir deuoted frend as I am, you would vtterly condemne in your selfe, this vaine iucredulitie which now you seeme to hold, and imagine in womens loues.
               I pray thee (quoth blanchardine) what is the name of that yong Knight, which she doth dote vpon so much?
               His name (quoth the Prouost) is Blanchardine▪
                   sonne to the King of Frizeland, a man of such generositie and valour, that through the world I think he hath no compeere: and my Ladies thoughts doo so wander vpon his perfections, that in the day, shee remembreth nothing so much as him, and in the night scant dreameth on anie thing but him, imagining still to see him return to her rescue: so that in my opinion, it were better to performe all the labours of Hercules againe, than to vndertake the obtaining of her loue, which is so strongly and surely grounded vppon the rocke of his affection, that no winde which anie mouth can blow, will make her once to stagger, in her determinations, and on my life what I haue said is true.
            
            
               
               Chap. 21.
               
                  How Blanchardine dispatched away the Prouost with his letter to the Queene of Tormaday, the contents altogether vnknowne to the Prouost, vntill the Queene had read it.
               
               
                  AFter this sad conference had with the Prouost, Blanchardine withdrawing himselfe closely into his cabben, calling for inke and paper, presently began to indite a letter to the quéen of Tormaday, which when he had finished, he deliuered to the Prouost, charging him safely to deliuer the same to her owne hands. After which, he calling the Prouost aside, tolde him that all those ships were fraught with Panims and Saracens, and that he himselfe was a Saracen: but (quoth hee) I knowe the man that you name, Blanchardine, who at this hower lieth imprisoned among the Panims in a most obscure dungeon: and the greatest comfort hee hath, is, that your Ladie and Quéene yet liueth, whom hee hopeth one day to visite againe, because he imagineth, that his absence is her onely discontentment.
               Ah verie God quoth the Prouost, that his returne might bee speedely, for in this time of his absence, no comfort can once make seazure on her hart, so that she being disquieted, al the Court and Citie lamenteth.
               After the Prouost had receiued the letter, and in humble wise taken leaue of blanchardine, he hoysed vp his sayles and poasted towards Tormaday, with such celeritie, that within two dayes he safely arriued there. Then he entring the Citie by a little posterne, repaired to the Church of our Ladie, where most humbly he thanked God for his prosperous returne: which being finished, hee presently went to the Court, where being entred the Presence, hee found the Quéene sitting verie melancholy: but making his dutifull obeysance to her Maiestie, he recounted vnto

her these newes, That at his arriuall at Norway hee found the King her vnckle dead two dayes before, and all the Lordes most pensiue and sorrowfull for his losse: but deliuering his ambassage to the Peeres, they made this reply, that so soone as the obsequies and funeralls of the King were performed, they would (according to their duties) make preparation for her seruice, being by discent their naturall Quéen and Princesse, whom aboue all other they were bounden to obay. When the Queene heard of her vnckles death, she grew most sorrowfull: but the Prouost desirous to put her out of such dumpes, certefied her of the huge Fleete of Panims that he met vppon the seas, and that a great Commaunder of the rest, requested him to deliuer this letter into her Maiesties own hands, which he promised faithfully to do, considering my duetie to your Maiestie, and the gentle vsage of the Panims towards me, at that time when I expected nothing but death. The Ladie receiuing the letter, so soone as she had opened it, found the contents to this effect.
               Most magnificent Princesse, the thred of my wearied life hath euer been lengthened, by the hope I haue had to succor your distresses, whom aboue all the world I honor and esteeme: and after my manifold and hard aduentures, beeing captiuated and made prisoner to king Alimodes, by the heauenly prouidence of God, I am deliuered and set frée. For beeing sent from you by the said king, vnder the safekeeping of his sonne Darius and three score soldiers, to bee presented to the king of Salmandry, whose brother Rubion I slew before the walls of Tormaday: being on the sea, the ship wherein I was (caried by rage of tempest) split vpon a huge rock so that of the three score men that were in her, none escaped but my selfe, who (by the great prouidence of God) bestrid a peece of the maine mast, and in little tune was carried a shore in the land of Spruce, not farre from the citie of Marienbourgh, where by reason of warre I haue beene constrained to serue in the warres of a Saracen King, with whom for my good deserts I haue obtained high rewards And vppon my humble petition to his Maiestie, he hath deliuered me fourteen thousand fighting men, with sufficient money, iewells and prouision, and withall hath sent his onely sonne Sadony in my companie, to rescue

you against that false periured miscreant Alimodes. And what time denies me now to write, I will so soone as I shall arriue at Tormaday, deliuer by word of mouth, which shall not be long, being within two dayes sayle of you: and because ye shal gather the true circumstance of my letter more perfectly, I send you it by this token, that I once receiued a kisse from your sweet lips, before I was receiued into your seruice. And thus in all humilitie, recommending my selfe and my true affection to your sacred person, the onely organ of my blisse and welfare, I take my leaue, praying God, to grant you accomplishment of all your happie desires. Written vpon the sea by the most vnfortunate Knight Blanchardine.
               
            
            Thus Gentlemen, haue I abruptly finished this first part of Blanchardines Aduentures, with the true constant loue of fayre Eglantine the proud Ladie in loue: which if it shall passe with your good fauors, I will verie shortly make the second part readie for the presse. In the meane while I wish ye well.

So I right worshipfull, not vnlike this rude Piper, hauing presumed to tune my rustie stringes to larum foorth my simple musicke in the translation of the first parte of Blanchardines aduentures, in presence of you, whose learned censure as farre passeth my capacitie, as Mercuries cunning did poore Hipercyans skill: yet hauing found your fauourable acceptance of the former, I am encouraged to perseuer in the dedicatiō of the second parte also, to you, his first and most worthy Patrone:

            This consideration (right worshipfull) was the spur that prickt me forth to offer the simple kernell which this fruitlesse shell incloseth, to your fauourable view, which I trust you wil vouchsafe to accept, though not according to the value, which is nothing, yet for the dutifull desire of the giuer, which is my most: For in this I protest, you may well deccrne, that my willing minde dooth bewraie my good meaning. And as the brightest Sun wanteth not fuell to yeild increase to his glorious light: so there is not wanting in me a sufficient will, to do you all possible dutie and seruice (by which two, the Scutchion of my zeale is and shall for euer be supported) Thus more then halfe assured, that this my poore Booke shall finde shelture to flie vnder the shadow of your wing, in whose good grace (if once it be armed) I force not what back-biting Momus or his currish mates can imagine against it. And as these (my Premities, patronized by you) shall seeme pleasing: so wil I alwaies be most readie (if any matter of more worth chance into my handes) to offer it vp in all dutie at your shrine: vntill when I take my leaue, praying God in this life to grace you with all happines, and in the other life withall blessednes.

                  How Blanchardine, with Sadony, his friendly companion, being on the Sea, bending their course to Tormaday, for the rescue of the faire Eglantine the proude Lady in loue, were by a suddaine gale compelled againe to Sea.
               
               
                  IN ye former treatise, of this most famous Historie, of the valiant Blanchardine whome we left vpon the Seas, with a most huge Nauy of Shippes in company with Sadony, Sonne to the King of Spruse: bending their course towardes the famous citty of Tormaday, to ye rescue of ye bewtiful Quéene Eglantine from the tyrany of ye proude Panim King Allimodes, whose long & dangerous seidge there, had bred a great dearth within the sayde Citty, to the distressed Quéene, & her dispairing company. Now the noble Prouost, making his returne from her vnkle the King of Noweigh, to whom he was 
                     •…
                  ent Ambassador to craue his ayd for her deliuery from this perrilous seidge, he happened to encounter vppon the Seas with Blanchardine, who (although in shew an Infidell,) yet in substance a true Christian, and vow

                   Queene Eglant
                        •…
                     , it bred to Blanchardine most swéet content wh
                     •…
                   he vnderstood that she was as

yet at libertie, and frée from the bondage of Alimodes: and therfore to redouble her comfort and solace, he wrote the letter before recited, which he deliuered to the Prouost, to be secretly with spéed conueighed to her owne hands.
               Now I say, the Prouost beeing returned to Tormaday, and hauing deliuered his aunswer from the States of Norweigh to her Maiestie, he forgat not withall to giue her the letter of Blanchardine, which when she had perused, and withall precisely noted both the contents and the writing: she presently perceiued it to be the true inscription of her loue Blanchardine: but brideling affection with modestie (although this suddaine and vnexpected happie newes might haue caused her to forget the rules of gouernment in breaking silence, which commonly is incident to th
                     •…
                   female sex) yet after some pause, she calling the Prouost in more secret manner a-side, began to question with him in these tearmes.
               Prouost quoth she, although this h
                     •…
                  auie and disaster chaunce augmenteth my passions for the vntimely dicease of my noble Vnkle the king of Norweigh, and that I am almost in dispaire of any succoure, from the nobles and states there, who excusing themselues at this present, by the solemnizing of the funeralls of their deceased King: Yet I pray thée, tell me, knowest thou the man from whome these letters were deliuered to be presented to mée?
               Madam (quoth the Prouost) if I shoulde enforme your maiestie that I knew the man, of whome I receiued, not only the letter, but also the greatest kindnes that I could desire, I should vtterly deceiue you and speake vntruly of my selfe. For (may it please your highnes,) in my returne from Norweigh: vppon the sodden, I had within ken a huge and mighty Nauy of Sarrizins and infidels, of whome standing in great doubt, yet seeing no meanes to escape the daunger I then thought my selfe in: I resolutely approched neerer them, and their Admirall sending aboord our ship, I was brought before him, whome when I beheld, although the feare I then was in and the maiestie of his countenance might haue daunted me on the suddaine, yet perceiuing

some generositie and clemencie to rest in his visage, I was some what recomforted: and after long parley betwixt him and me touching my condition and your maiesty (whose seruant I enformed him I was) he demaunded the cause of my Ambassage, and to whome I was sent: which when I had recounted at large, he séemed to pitty your distresse, which made me then more bolde and presumptious, to demaund of him (if in your ayde) hée with all this noble and valiant company, would come to Tormaday, because I immagined that a man of such magnanimous courage (as he séemed to be) would hazard his person, in defence of a maiden Princesse, so sore and vniustly distressed.
               Why quoth the generall, thinkest thou that if I should enforce both my selfe, and all this honorable company to come to succour her in this dangerous enterprize, that shée would b
                     •…
                  nd her affection to like & loue me, so far forth as to become my wife and paramour, & to enuest me with the diadem of Tormaday, and with all the Signories dew to the crowne and dignitie?
               Alas sir (quoth I) our Quéene and Mistresse, whome all the world doth admire for singularity of beauty, hath euer since her byrth disdained and reiected the loue of many and mighty kings hauing vowed a perpetuall virginitie. And for the same onely cause are these warres, which King Alimodes wageth against her, whome (in regard of mariage) although he be a mighty and most victorious Prince, yet she accompteth of him, as of the meanest slaue in this your fleete. And for her obstinacie against these Noble Kings, in loue shée is sur-named faire Eglantine the proud Lady in loue.
               But not long since (may it please you) she is entangled in the most rare and deuine beauty, of the brauest man at armes that euer nature framed of earthly mould, whose courage and valia
                     •…
                   in the subduing of our soes, before the walles of Tormaday, hath so conquered the hart, and true affection of our Quéene, that all per

                  wasions in the world, may not cause her once to forget the sincerety of loue, which she vnfainedly hath vowed to him. But in the haruest of these her summers ioyes, cruell winter hath nypt the blossome of her blisse. For not long since, this

valiant and victorious Gentleman, named Blanchardine, making issue out vppon the enimy, before the Towne of Tormaday, by some accidentall chance of cruell war, was by the foe suddenly surprized and taken, who not accepting of any Ransome, haue sent him to the king of Salamandry, whose brother Rub
                        •…
                     
                   he lately flew before the walles of Tormaday, there to bée torti
                     •…
                  d to death, against all humanity right and conscience, whose absence and harde aduenture, our Queene doth so gréeuously deplore, that all pleasure seemes to her paine, & all gladnes, 
                     〈◊〉
                  : and shortly I doubt me, wil bring her to her graue, vnlesse she heare some happy tydings of his spéedy returne.
               Wel (said he) I know Blanchardine whom your Quéene doth so highly adore, and whom you so amply commend, and not long since I saw the man, fettered in the Panims prisons, with huge and mighty manacles and gyues of Iron, and doth neuer expect deliuery or fréedome, but some terrible and cruell death.
               Therefore, since he is not likelye to returne, by reason of his hard and straight imprisonment, and also the cruelty of the foe, vnder whose custody he now remaines: thinkest thou not that she can and will forget him and his affection, and consent to the loue of mee, who in her defence, will make Alimodes and all his forces to recoile, and leaue this seidge, which (as you say) hée hath and doth lay against her Citty of Tormaday for her loue?
               Sir (quoth I) it were casisr for a man to vndertake the labours of mighty Hercules, then attempt the conquering of her loue, which is irreuocable from that most valiant Gentleman Blanchardine.
               
               After which speaches betwéene vs in secret ended, hee withdrew himselfe into his cabben, where calling for pen, inke and paper, he wrote this letter, which I haue presented to your Maiestie, but what it importeth, or whereof bee the contents, I am vtterly ignorant.
               Then quoth the proude Quéene in loue, know trusty Prouost that the man whome thou thus commendest, and who deliuered th
                     •…
                   this letter, is the very same gentleman Blanchardine, whom I loue, and for whose sake, I haue endured all this woe. And

héere he writeth, that hauing obtained the Princely fauor of the King of Spruse, whose enemy being the king of Polond: he vanquished, and deliuered prisoner into his hands, for whose trustines and in requitall of whose valor, he hath deliuered vnto him those shippes well furnished, with men, munition and victuall, and withall sent his Sonne and Heire apparant to the Crowne of Spruse in his assotiation and companye, for our deliuery and rescue, from the tyrany of this Pagan King Alimodes. And that within these two daies he will not fayle to come a land at Tormaday, with all his garrisons and companies.
               When the Prouost had diligently attended this pleasant discourse of the Quéene, in deliuering the swéet contentes of the letter of Blanchardine, being greatly astonisht at this suddaine accident, calling to his remembrance the comely proportion of him that deliuered the letter, and comparing it with Blanchardine: made her this answere.
               Truely Madam, well might he séem to carry the proportion of Blanchardine in body, but his countenance and visage, séemed more like a Tawny Moore then his sweet semblance: and neyther could I imagine by hys behauiour, neyther gather by hys wordes, any notice of Blanchardins person, sauing only that hee told mee he knew the man, and that his imprisonment was such and so straight among the infidels, that his returne was neuer to be expected. And this is all (may it please your Maiestie) that I could eyther imagine or coniecture of him.
               After these speaches ended betwéene the Quéen and the Prouost, she sent for her nurse, who assending vp into a gallerie, from whence she might decerne the sea, and sayles afarre off, she began to enter parley with her in this manner.
               Thou art altogether vnacquainted, (swéet Nurse) both of the cause of my hastie sending for thée, & of the pleasant newes, which the Prouost hath brought me, yet because thy fidelitie hath euer bene a consolation to my sorowes, I will acquaint thee therewith.
               Knowe that the onely Iuell of my thought, and the man of greatest regard with me in the world, hauing escaped many

perills, and most manifest daungers, is now at hand, not onely to bring mée most happy content, but with a mighty troope of braue warriers, comming to rescue me, against this periured king Allimodes, and by the contentes of this my letter, he will not faile to arriue here within fewe houres.
               Therefore let vs continually watch, and cast our eyes to the maine, to sée (if it be possible) the braue troops of Sailers, and Soldiers, which do warrant our deliuerie from this extreame thraldome, wherein long heretofore, and at this present we liue without any hope of succour and enlargement.
               The nurse tickled with this blessed newes, failed not to performe what the quéene pleased to commaund. And not long remaining, in this contented hope, they might escrie from farre a huge Nauie of Armadoes, Carreckes, Galliasses, Galliouns, great Gallies, and tall shipps; besides: Pinnases, Friggets, Caruells, Shallopps and suche small vessels: all which, sayling before the wind, bended their full course to the citie of Tormaday, (as they immagined) But not long after, ye winde comming to the Nort and by East; vpon the sudden, they were compelled to strike saile, let fall Anker, hale in their maine sheates, cut downe their mastes, & thus (in vtter dispaire of all safetie,) to cōmitte both their ships & thēselues to ye mercy of the waues, which brought such an vnexpected change and feare vnto the quéene, that voyd of all hope, either for her owne safetie, or of Blanchardines (whom she so much desired) presently she fell into a sound, but her nurse wel acquainted wt these suddaine passions of her Ladie, presently cōueied her to her lodging, where after many perswasiue speaches and swéete allurements, she began somewhat to comfort herselfe, hoping that as God had deliuered Blanchardine from greater dangers then this (as she thought) so nothing was impossible for his returne; where let vs leaue her, to tell of the aduenturs of Blanchardine and his companie.
            
            
               
               Chap. 2.
               
                  How Blanchardine and Sadony with all their companie, arriued before the cittie of Cassedony, where Darius and faire Beautrix, the sonne & daughter of king Alimodes, held their royall court.
               
               
                  THEN Blanchardine perceiuing the tēpest, rather to increase then any whit to calme, unmagining with himselfe, that Infidels and Pagans, were vtterlie exempt from the fauor and mercy of God, and that this contagion of weather grew▪ by his vniust conceling of his christianitie, and dissembling Paganizmiei (As Christ saith) he that denieth me before men, I will denie him before God. Blanchardine pricked forward with this spur, came to Sadony in these tearmes.
               I know (right trustie and honorable companion) that the mightie and immortall God of heauen, being displeased with the idolatrous worshipping of stockes & stones (then the which nothing can be more hatefull in his sight) thundereth downe these huge & mightie stormes & tempests now vpon vs, and therfore if euer loue, victorie or true magnanimitie, preuailed in the minde of thée (my sweete friend Sadony) let vs foorthwith appease the anger wherewith God is iustly incensed against vs, by becomming trew and faithfull beléeuers in his blessed sonne Iesu Christ: which if my perswation may effect and bring to passe, I dare assure you shall not onely mittigate the angry wrath of God, but for euer, sorte all our enterprizes to happie ende.
               
                  Sadony, who through the integritie of affection to Blanchardine, and with all for feare of his and his companies vtter ouerthrowe, not onely gaue Blanchardine his franke consent, to become Christian, with all his followers, but also to send both his

Idols, and their Iuels (which were moste ritch and of inestimable valure) into the bottome so the Sea, the which without all delaye was by his prerogatiue and especiall commaundement persormed.
               After which, the stormes began by little & little to decrease, the cloudes to vanish, and the Sea to waxe calme, which bred a most pleasant content to Blanchardine, and procured a stedfastnesse in faith of these newe become Christians, who greatly reioyced to finde them selues free, not onely from the rage of the Sea, but also from the illusion of their false faith, wherein long time they had erred.
               But not long after, sayling with a most pleasant gale, [but in a strange and vnknown Coast] they escried a farre off, a most rich and populus country, whether with all speede they bended their wandering course: and being come within perfect view of this Iland, they found a most quiet and safe hauen, both for their ships to lye, and for them selues to land: so without delay▪ euery man addressed himselfe to goe ashore, to refresh their wearie Seabeaten bodies.
               When Blanchardine and Sadony perceiued that their whole company (sauing the Mariners) were on land, they began to muster their men, and presently to march in order of battell to the Citie, which was scarse a league distant from the hauen: and their horsemen scouring the plaines, hauing made seizure on a countrey swaine, brought him before the generals, who presently examined him of the estate & gouerment of the countrie, vnto whom the pore captiue related at large, the some of their demaund.
               This Countrey (quoth he) is a Region scittuate néere the Sea, called Cassedony, where at this day raigneth a most puisant and mightie Sarizen king, named Alimodes, who is now with a huge host, beseidging the princely Citie of Tormaday, where the most beautifull queene Eglantine, renewned through the world for chastitie, holdeth her royall court: for whose loue, our king Alimodes, hath forsaken this our Countrie, and meaneth to obteine her affection by force, because he may not winne

her by kindnesse: and in his stéed heere, he hath left his valorous sonne Darius, and faire Beautrix his daughter, to gouerne till his returne, and at this instant they both are in this princely Cittie héere at hand.
               
                  Blanchardine most glad of his happie arriuall, within the teritories of king Alimodes his detested foe, discoursed bréefely to Sydony, that now by the prouidence of God, and their happie fortune, they were landed in that place where the bewtifull Beautrix (Alimodes daughter) lay, whome Blanchardine had long before promised to giue to him in mariage. And therefore (trustie companion quoth he) now shewe the valure and high magnanunitie, which I haue euer expected in you, for the subduing of these miscreants and accursed Infidels, and for the obteining of the most beautifull Ladie that your eye hath soene: so shall we [by the helpe of God] inuest you not only with the dyademe of Cassidony, but also espowse you to that faire Queene, for whose swéet sake you haue aduentured this long and wearie iourney, and héerein I assure you we shall honor our God (whome wée now serue) seate you in this Regall throne with your faire Queene, and deliuer the most chaste and bewtifull Quéene of Tormaday my mistres and loue, from the tyranie of the cursed monster Alimodes: Courage therefore Noble Sadonye, and in the name of our God let vs set vpon them, in whose name I doubt not but we shall presently subdue them.
               When Sadonye vnderstood by the reporte of Blanchardine, that the faire Beautrix whome he so much commended, and vpon whose commendations he so entirely loued, rested within that Cittie, he needed not to ad more fuell to the fire: for his eager desire was such: as he rather seemd too forward, then any whit too slacke, to accomplish or attempt any thing, that he would perswade him vnto.
               Now these two haughty coragious caualiers, brauely moū
                  ted, with all their followers, some on horsebacke, some on foote, marched neere vnto the walles of the Cittie, whose approche beeing by certaine espyalls discried, was foorthwith related to Daryus, who at that instant, was in his Pallace, sporting

with his beautifull sister Beautrix, which suddaine alarum and vnexpected newes, at the first so daunted his courage, that as a man halfe distract of his sences, he knew not what to determine: But calling his wits together, he presently commaunded that thirtie thousand men should be in redines at the sound of a Trumpet, to issue out vppon the enimie, and that hee in person would goe to vnderstand the cause of their approch thether without his speciall conduct and license.
               Prouision was forthwith with all posible speede made. And euerie man being armed (vnder the conduct of Darius) issued out of Cassidony vppon Blanchardine and his company, who not vnprouided for their comming, were ready to giue them their welcome: Darius presently dispatched a herrald at armes, to enquire the cause of this outrage vppon his dominions and people? vnto whom Blanchardine replyed, that first the honor & seruice of hys God, secondly the reuengement of the manyfest wrongs offered to the beautifull Queene of Tormaday by his father, and lastly the great desire that Sadony (Sonne and Heire to the King of Spruse) had to wed the beautifull Beautrix (Alimodes daughter) were the only and sufficient causes of this their warlike ariuall. And therfore without delay they commaunded Darius to submit himselfe, his Crowne, and Realme, with the faire Beautrix, into their handes. Otherwise, they would with fire and sword consume, and confound, al that cursed broode of Miscreant Sarazins, and leaue the Country depopulated and waste. And with these or the like spéeches inioyned the herrald presently to returne to Darius, to giue him to vnderstand their resolution.
               The Herrald being returned to Darius, certified him both their answers & some of their demaunds, the which séemed so displeasant vnto him, that without further delay, hee couragiously gaue the onset on the Enemy. At whose encounter the earth trembled, and the ayre ecchoed with noyes of their weapons: the clamor of the people was excéeding great, the Sarizins stil with blasphemous outcries calling vpō their blockish idolatrous gods whose deafe eares could heare no sound of their foolish petitions: but at the length, after a long and dangerous conflict, the tounsmen

fearing, through their great losse and bloodshed, that they were like to be ouercome, recoyled and retyred backe, euery one so fast as his spéed would giue leaue.
               But Blanchardine now thinking high time to finish what before he determined, set spurres to his horse, and by great chance singled out Darius from the company, whome Blanchardine so saluted with his Launce, that he sent him to carry news to Radamant, of the valure which he found in Blanchardines arme.
            
            
               Chap. 3.
               
                  How the beautifull Beautrix perceiuing her people vanquished and brother slaine: submitted her to the mercy of Sadony, and rendred both her selfe and Citty into his handes.
               
               
                  IT happened at that instant, that the faire Beautrix was mounted vp into a high window within her Palace, frō whence she might well decerne, the valure of the Knights and soldiers on both sides. But when she saw her brother Darius slaine, the standard ouerthrowen, and her people to fly: she began a most lamentable complaint. But seeing that care was booteles in a cureles cause, she determined to yeild both her self, country and people, to the victors handes, hoping by her humble submission, to obtaine a generall pardon.
               Now by this time Blanchardine and Sadony were met, and wintly marched without resistance within the Citty, where for a while they surueighed, the sumpteous buldings of ye Sarizins: but pacing along the stréetes, towards the Kings Palace, they were encountred by the Lady Beautrix, who humbling her self on her knées, made this petition.

                   hath resigned this kingdome, people and my

selfe into your hands, yet as in your countenance there is seated both maiestie and mercy, let the rigor of your murdering swords cease, and we all are ready to yeild vnto the full of your princely demaundes.
               
                  Blanchardine pittying the Ladyes playnts, gently lifted her vp from the ground, & withall, gaue her these comfortable speaches: fayre Ladye, the heauens by their diuine prouidence, haue for many causes alotted vs this happie fortune, to bee conquerers of this mighty kingdome: and blame you not fortune, but thanke the fates for our successe, for where as all your daies, you haue honored and adored Idols and false gods, wee will so open your vnderstandings, that you shall not only perceiue your monsterous errors, but also become the worshippers of the true and immortall God. But aboue all the sundry and deadly imuries, which of long (and yet) your father Alimodes offereth vnto my Lady and mistresse, the chast Queene of Tormaday, haue the rather augmented my fury in prosecuting this conquest, with fire and sword, thereby to performe a most sacred vow and promise, which I made to this noble Gentleman Sadony Sonne to the King of Spruse long since. These causes (I say) makes me most humbly thanke God for this happy arriuall and victory.
               Then taking the Lady by the hand, he presented her to Sadony in this sort. Honorable freend and deere companion, now that the heauenly powers, haue enricht vs with this most happy victory, and that I may cancell the obligation (in part) of the great det, which I acknowledge my selfe bound vnto you: take héere this most beautifull Lady, whome long since I promised you at Marienbrough, to bee your spouse and wife, and vpon our loues I coniure you, that you faile me not in th'accomplishment of two things, which I shall request at your hands, after I haue inuested you with the figniory and kingdome of Cassidony, and this faire Queene: The one, that foorthwith you cause both her and all her subiectes, to be baptized in the christian faith: and secondly after you are quietlye seated héere, you fayle not to ioyne with me in the succoure of the faire Quéene of Tormaday, whose disaster breedes discontentment to my soule, and daunger to my

life.
               This present was so thankfully accepted of Sadony, that nothing could bring him more content, for when he cast his eye vpon the damsell, he thought himselfe eleuated into the third heauen, immagining it, a thing impossible for any mortall creature, to carry so deuine a seature. Thē séeing himselfe also possest with such a mighty and populous kingdome, hee séemed rauished in conceit. But breaking of these admirations, after a million of thankes giuen to God, and all kindnesse to Blanchardine, he began with the damsell in this sort.
               Faue Ladie, whose radiant eyes shine like Vestaes candels, or the twinkling starres in the firmament, sufficient to dazell humane eyes, & to reuiue al dying sences, whose amber lockes, desheuiled on these shoulders, make you seeme like Cynthia in her pride, if euer happinesse were incident to mortall man, now may I boast to haue reached the tipe of all soelicitie, in that Iimbrace you, whose verie lookes, haue so attached me on the sudden, that wheras, euen now I was a conquerer, I am by you (faire Lady) conquered, and must of force, make your swéete person, the true prison of my heart: denie me not then (faire Queene) whose parrentage is answerable with yours, to yeelde me your loue, which while I liue, I vow to kéepe firme, and mine to you inuiolable.
               The beutifull Quéene Beautrix, giuing diligent attention to the sugred speaches of Sadony, first weighing the miserable state of her countrie, secondly the absence of her father, with the death of her brother Darius, & lastly (which was most) the comely proportion of Sadony, as willingly gaue her consent to mariage, as he was forward in demaunding thereof.
               Then Sadony, right glad of this swéete consent of the faire Beautrix, imbracing her withall kindnesse, after many kisses, and swéet speaches passed betwene them, demaunded of her if she would forsake her Paganizme and diabollitall profession, and become a christian, who by his good perswasions, was brought quickly to condiscend.
               Now at the same time, there were certaine Christian prisoners,

which long had endured the tortures of the Pagan Alimodes, remaining within the cittie in seuerall prisons, to the number of one hundreth, which Sadony caused presently to bee enlarged and set at libertie: and among this distressed company of Christians, there were certaine Preestes, whome he commaunded presently to be brought before him, & caused them to singsollemne processions, and giue praise to God for his happie victory: after this, he commaunded them to sanctitie and halow, certaine waters, wherein all the Panims should be baptised, with himselfe, his Quéene, and followers, vpon paine of death, and presently sent out his Edict and proclamation, that al the inhabitants within those dominions, should with all possible spéed, come to Cassidony, there to receiue the holy Baptisme & fayth in Iesu Christ. After all which solemnities, with great reuerence performed, he tooke to wife the faire Quéene Beautrix, to the exceeding contentment of all the beholders. I néed not here make mention of the sumptiousnes of the feasts, the applause of the late imprisoned Christians, the concourse of the common people, to behold this magnificent wedding, but leaue it to the reader, to imagine. But of one thing especially, I must giue you to vnderstand, that the Bride was so adorned with gemmes, ouches, and precious stones that day, that if all the worlde should haue imployed their paines to obtaine the like, I thinke they are not to be gotten: all which, that most cruell homicide and periured miscreant Alimodes, had by exaction, extorted from all his neighbours Christians, by force and villany. But when all these tryumphes (which endured the space of thrée daies) were finished, Sadony reforming ye diabolicall customes, which had many yeres continuance within that region, in steed thereof established Iusttice, religion and godlines, to the great comfort of the inhabitants of Cassidony, in which long after they continued, in most prosperous, and happy estate and tranquilitie.
            
            
               
               Chap. 4.
               
                  How Blanchardine found his father the King of Frize imprisoned within the Citty of Cassidony: and deliuered him from thence.
               
               
                  IT fortuned not long after this solemnity was finished, that Sadony, Beautrix and Blanchardine, walking abroad for their disport, heard the most pittifull outcry and lamentation of certaine other prisoners, neere the Citty, which were almost famished for want of bread, which dolefull noise, so penetrated the gentle hearts of these three Princes, that Sadony demaunding what voice the same might be, a knight attendant, made this reply. Know noble King that not long since, our quondam Lord and Prince Darius, bending his course to the renowned Citty of Tormaday, to mannage armes in the ayde of hys father, against the faire Eglantine (surnamed the proude Lady in loue) was by a suddaine tempest at sea, dryuen from his course, and without their compasse, into a land, which as the inhabitants called the land of Frize, where (by great hap) within that little Iland at that time, a great Lord of that Country, came with diuers Gentlemen of great account to disport themselues, both for the holsomnes of the ayre, the fertiity of the soile and the swéet recreations that place did afford, vppon our arriuall wee ranging the thickets and plaines of the Country, tooke prisoner one, who for feare, discouered the whole state of the country, and the resedency of this Lord and gentlemen, at that time there by whose direction we secretly marching to the Palace, on the suddaine surprized the said Lord, with all his braue troop, who at our enterance seemed to resist, but finding their forces vnable to encounter a multitude, yeelded themselues to mercy: Darius (whome pitty could not peirce) vtterly refusing raunsome commaunded

them presently, to be conueighed to this Citty, there to remaine during their liues, captiues. And these (most mighty Princes) are the prisoners, whose lamentation, you heare.
               When Blanchardine heard him speake of Frize, ablushing red beautifying his chéekes, he began straight to coniecture, that out of all doubt this Lord was desended of his linage and house, commaunding presently to fetch them before him & the other princes, which the posting messenger, spéedily performed: and hauing presented them to the three Princes, Blanchardine fixing a stéedfast view vpon them, knew his father, (although the hard imprisonment and hungry diet, had masserated and made him leaner then he was wont to be) whereat Blanchardine began secretly to lament the hard distresse of his aged Sire. But incurraging himselfe to speake, he demaunded of him, what country man he was, and the chaunce that brought him into these calamities? The aged king, faint by reason of famine: and feble by his age, after a little pause made this reply.
               Know sir, that I am a most distressed and captiue King, my Country (which of long time I gouerned, with happines and quiet) is called Frize, scituated néere the sea, but through the mutabilitie and chaunce of fortune my land hath béene depopulated and layde waste, my subiectes slaine, and my selfe with diuers of my nobles taken prisoners, by Darius the Sonne of Alimodes, who not pittying my age and gray haires, hath too too long inclosed vs, within a most obscure and darke prison, full of venim and fylth: in which I and my poore company▪ are ready to famish, for want of sustenance, against the law of God, manand nature: vtterly refusing all ransomes, that haue béene proffered for our deliueries.
               But a Sonne I had [whose yeares and countenance presaging valure] made both my selfe and his mother, to haue too tender a care ouer him, fearing some worse euent thē wee had cause to dread: and for this onely cause we rather tooke care, to instruct him in learned sciences, then to pricke him forward to beare armes, who like a Lion vnwilling to bee tamed, and spend his yeares in subiection and home bred toyes, because I refused to

inuest him with the order of knighthood, one day very secretly, (without all our priuities) went away: and since his departure wee haue not so much as receiued any newes or tidinges of him, which hath bred in me such sorrow & griefe, that I wish rather a thousand times to die then thus to liue depriued, not only of my liberty and kingdome, but of my Sonne, whose towardlines (being a child) was of all admired, and whose losse (through my fault) of all pittied. Therefore my humble petition is (if it rest in your powers), to rid me by some kind of death, out of this lothsome and gréeuous thraldoms, wherein I now liue, who rather account it a happines to dye, than thus distressed with misery to liue. After which his pittyfull complaint, the teares distilled doune his waterie eyes, vppon his aged face so thick, that made all the company to be waile his hard aduenture & mishap, but especially Blanchardine his sonne, within whome loue and pitty made their combat.
               Sir quoth Blanchardine) may it be, that if your son were héere at this time, considering his long departure from you, doe you imagine that you shoulde knowe him, by his fauour and countenance?
               Ah (answered the king to well I knowe, that these my drooping eyes, which pore still vppon my graue, shall neuer receiue such content, as once to infix them selues on his amyable face.
               
                  Blanchardine not able any longer to conceale himselfe from his aged father, sayd vnto him, know noble King, that not long since, this noble Gentleman Sadony and my selfe, not only sawe your Son, but accompanied him long time. And betwéene vs, were all things common, so that the mutuall kindnes and loue, which we conceiued of echother, was by no meane to bee disioyned, and we accounted of one an other, as of our selues: in so much, that at his departure from our company, he gaue me this ring of gold, which héere I weare, and for his sake, will reserue during my life.
               The good old King, remembring the perfect forme of the ring, which his sonne Blanchardine had shewen him, knew presently that it was the ring, which his granfather vsed to weare, and at

his death vequethed the same to Blanchardine. And being by this sight the more encoraged, he in most humble maner requested to vnderstand the cause of his sonnes departure frō their honorable companies, and the place, whether they did imagine he had bent his course, hoping at length (if euer he obtained fréedome) to visit his sonne Blanchardine. But when he heard him not reply to his humble demannd, the olde King suspecting, that his departure, was rather a seperation by death then a voluntary absence from their society, after sundry and gréeuous sighes, was ready to sound. But Blanchardine, who now perceiued by his pittiful complaints, that vnles he should make himselfe knowne, it myght he greatly preiudiciall to his health, and that delay in such a case, bred great danger: he reuoking his former obstinacy, humbling himselfe, began to make himselfe knowne to the old man in this sort.
               Most redoubted Lord and déere father, beholde Blanchardine your sonne, whose offence to your maiestie deserueth no fauour, in that his departure from your Court was most secretly concealed from all (but especially from your selfe) humbly submitting himselfe, to your doome, craueth your honourable pardon, both for his fault in departing, and also for the gallant courser, and sword which hee priuily conuayed away with him with the which among many other, he hath reuenged your wrongs vpon your enemy Darius, and his accursed company of miscreants.
               When his aged father the King of Frize, heard the dutyfull and debonaire submission of his sonne (whome till that very instant he knew not) by reason of the obscuritie, and darkenes of his prison, & also his declining age: neither can my pen recount nor my tong relate, the happie content he receiued, and the generall applause to all (But especially to Sadony, and the faire Beautrix, who all this while, were attentiue beholders of this rare accident, and when they perceiued the ful issue of all which had happened betwéene them, they congratulated this happy chance with Blanchardine and his father. And presently caused a sumpteous bath, and most honorable and rich apparell, to bée prepared for the aged king, with all the duties belonging to his

royall estate: and in like sort, for all the Knightes, and Gentlemen his attendantes.
               Now when Blanchardine (somwhat recalled from his immaginations) after the conference in publique ended, betwéene the king and the rest of the company, hauing brought his father into a most sumpteous chamber, enbossed with gold, and hanged with most rich tapestry, conuenient for his estate, he demaunded of him the estate and welfare of the Quéene his mother, and his country? Alas faire sonne quoth the king, I haue béene here inclosed, in a most obscure prison, this yeare and more, in which time, I neuer had any priuate conference with any, sauing a base villaine, vnder whose cruell and hard custody, I haue long remained comfortles, so that I greatly feare me, that my captiuitie once bruted to her louing eares, whose pensiue thoughtes for thée, had almost before my departure consumed her, haue now altogether depriued her, both of health and life: but the case is only known to God, and not to me, that haue not so much as sent neyther receiued any letter or token from her since my comming into this most accursed country, which hath béene hetherto gouerned by the cruellest miscreant that euer hell or nature hatched.

                  How Sadony, Blanchardine and the King of Frize enbarqued themselues to Tormaday for the succour of faire Eglantine the proude Lady in loue.
               
               
                  AFter that al teares were cleane wiped from their eies, and that the aged King of Frize and his faint company, had somwhat recouered their perfect strength & courrages, Blanchardine, (whose wandering thoughts were still occupiedin the contemplation of the rare and deuine beauty of his Mistresse, the Quéene of Tormaday and on her succours against the periured infidell, and Sarizine Alimodes, séeing conuenient time and leysure to serue, before Sadony, Beaut

                     ix and his aged father▪ began thus to complaine.
               Most honorable fréend and trusty companion Sadony, since by the high deuine, and most sacred prouidence of God, you haue obtained your hearts content, and the onely Iuell which long you haue desired, I meane this faire and beautifull Princesse Beautrix your wife, and that the true sincere, and christian religion is surely planted within this your Kingdom, whereby God may be truely serued your people preserued, and your country at quiet, that now you will remember, your sacred vow and promise, which faithfully you plighted to me, in the sight of God and heauen, for the spéedy succour of my faire Lady & mistres, the Quéene of Tormaday, against our foe Alimodes: and although these wars may be some cause to seperate you from your beautifull Quéene and bride (for a while) in whome resteth the full of your content and delight, yet considering the Christian Religion which you now professe, and by which you are coniured, and most strickly bound, to prosecute these wars vppon an infidell, in the defence of a most vertuous Christian Quéene. And also remembring,

your trustie promise made vn

                  o me before our arriuall héere in Cassidony. These causes (I say) duly considered, will (I trust) be sufficient spurs to pricke you on to this inquest, wherein your seruice shall not onely bee acceptable to God, but most kindly taken and requited by mée, whose fidelity shall rest for euer, engrau
                     •…
                  n within the intrals of my soule inuiolable.
               And you faire Quéene (speaking to Beautrix) although I knowe that you can hardly permit this suddaine departure of your Princely husband (considering your late mariage) the sincere loue you beare him, and swéete content you receiue in hys presence, yet since your kingdome doth remaine safe and voyde of daunger, being garded with so many and valiant knights, as we meane to leaue héere for your defence: and for that the time will not belong before he make his safe & swéet returne, graunt frée leaue (most faire Quéene) to Sadony, to performe this honorable enterprize, although against your father, yet being the seruice of God, and therefore of greatest force, ought by all possible meanes to be vndertaken.
               When the fayre Princesse, had heard Blanchardine to the full of his demaund, although two extreame euills, were at once to be determined by her consent, first the departure of her new and most louing husband Sadony, secondly the warres they intended, were againsther owne father Alimodes: yet being allured both by the pittifull teares that distiled doune from his eyes, and the swéet speaches that procéeded from his mouth, shee srankly gaue her consent.
               Nowe Sadony although loath to forsake his newe married Quéene, and vnwilling to incurre the scandall of periurie to his approued friend, with all willingnes commaunded his shippes to be made ready, both with munition and victuall, and thirtie thousand soldiers, knights and gentlemen, for the spéedy performance of this seruice, which withall diligence, was prepared and in readines.
               When Blanchardine saw the willingnes
                     •…
                   the kingly consent of Sadony his approued friend, hee rendred him many and harty thankes, vowing the perpetuitie of their freindships, for euer to

                  cancelled.
               All things according to commaund being in readines, Sadony (by the good aduice of his trusty companion Blanchardine) apointed sundry garrisons of approued knights and soldiers, to remaine within the Citie of Cassidony, for the defence thereof against forraine inuasions, and to repulse King Allimodes if hee should in the meane, chance to returne thether before them)
               Then after a sollemne leaue taken of the Quéene, and all her hono

                  able companie, all thinges beeing left in good and quiet order, they betooke themselues to the Sea where hauing a pleasāt gale, they in short space were past the ken of land running their wished course to Tormaday, for the deliuery (as I said before) of the faire Quéene Eglantine the proud Lady in lou
                     •…
                  , where lets a while leaue them, to recount something of the miscreant Alimodes & his accursed company, whom we left before the walles of Tormaday in great hope to bee owner, both of the Quéene and Country.
               We recounted at large before, how the proude Alimodes layd his daily and continuall seidge to the Citie of Tormaday, after the departure of his sonne Darius, and the great losse of the victualles which he brought out of Prize. But as yet neyther his assaultes, Canuizadoes, nor allarums, bred any daunger, though son

                  e feare to the Citizens within the towne, yet many hardy knights and soldiers on both sides lost their liues, in making outrodes, to terrifie the enemie. But Alimodes perceiuing his victualls to waste, his men to die, some by war, some by sicknes, and no hope of any victorie, hee on a suddaine earely in the morning, caused his Cannons to be planted against the Walles, his rammes and engines of war, to be reared vp, hoping to effect the full of his desire, the sound and noise of which, being heard within the Towne, caused a trembling feare to surprize the Citizens, but especially the Quéene, who now almost without hope of any succour
                     •…
                   from her vnkle, the King of Norweigh (lately dead) the losse of her knights and soldiers at home, and especially the want of her true and trusty seruant Blanchardine, (shee I say) hearing this suddaine allarum, mounted vp into her high

Turret, from whence she might as well decerne the Sea as the enemy before the walles: And standing there in this doubtfull traunce, almost comfortles and desperate of succour, casting her eye to the maine, shee might esc
                     •…
                  y a far off, a huge and 
                     〈◊〉
                   Nauy, whose spreading sayles, fild with a pleasant gale, 
                     •…
                  ended (as she thought) their running course to Tormaday.
               
               This suddaine and vnexpected sight, drew her into a dout, what she might coniecture of this accident: sometime comforted▪ with hope, but straight plunged in dispaire: one time intagining it to be Blanchardine, an other time to be Darius, that came to releiue and ayde his father against her: Thus in perplexities, shée continued the space of one houre and more, in which time, shee might more perfectly perceiue the number of vessels that with speedy course came thether. And in these ag

                  eased not to inuocate the mercy of God, whose mighty power she euer acknowledged, to excéede al humane riches, to send her comfort in her calamities.
               Now Blanchardine through the brightnes of the Sun, whose beames made a refliction vppon the rigorous walles of the City, standing on the hatches, with the aged king of Frize his father, fixing a more perfect veiw therō, he began to relate vnto him, the sumpteous buildings of ye City, not forgetting, both the bounty & beauty of the faire Quéene Eglantine, her Princely affection towards him, and his humble loue and dutie to her, vowing if euer he might come a shore, to encounter with Alimodes, hee woulde make knowne his loue by his valor on the enemy, in her iust and righteous quarrell, fully resolued that what hee should attempt in her 
                     〈◊〉
                   against Alimodes, was meritorious in the sight of God 
                     〈◊〉
                  .
               With these and the like spéeches, they drew so néere the shore that they might decerne at full, the Pauilions and tents of the Pagans, pitched vppon the plaines, before the City.
               Now the proude pucell in loue, the faire Quéene Eglantine, leaning in her window, and seeing these ships ready to come 
                     •…
                  o anker and land their men, shee sent presently for the Prouost, (her most assured and trusty seruant) who came incontinently.

The Quéene leading him into the toppe of her Turret, shewed him this huge Nauy, demaunding who they might be? The Prouost béeing ingenious, and full of corrage, answered, that they were (as he thought) Christians, both by the shew of their flags, streamers and appendants: ah God graunt (quoth the Quéene) they be. The Prouost replying, requested her maiestie to send him, not only to make inquirie what they were, but also to wage them, if he could, to fight vnder her maiesties standerds, against Alimodes and his forces.
               The Quéene desirous of succour, condecended, and presently dispatched the Prouost accordingly, who without delay tooke a ship boat, rowed with eight tall fellowes, and by their diligence and paine; he came aboord the ship where Blanchardine was, who desirous to vnderstand what they might be, that posted so fast to come aboord him, walked vp and doune vpon the hatches vntill they were assended. Then the Prouost began with an audatious corrage, to deliuer the Embassage of his Quéene and Mistres, in as ample manner as shee had giuen him in charge: Blanchardine, whose affection to the Prouost was not forgotten well perceiuing the cause of his speach, to tend to the succour of his Princesse and country, enquired of him: If occasion were that no ayd should come, how long he thought the towne was able todefend it selfe, against the force of Alimodes, both with men, munition and necessarie prouision of victuall. Sir answered the Prouost, our city is wel fortefied, for many moneths, as yet, neither do we doubt of Alimodes forces, which are not able to hurt vs: but one thing séemeth most displeasant vnto all her subiectes, that neyther night nor day, her maiestie enioyeth any content, tormenting her selfe with sighes and passions, which we all dout will sort to some hard euent, vnlesse a spéedy remedy be found for her recomforture.
               
                  Blanchardine very desirous to vnderstand, what disaster yt might be, which so vnkindly, bred such discontentment to the Quéene, earuestly solicited the Prouost, to relate the cause at large.
               The Prouost most willingly obeying the princely commaund and gentle intreaty of Blanchardine, answered in this sort
               
                  Know sir, that the extreamity of griefe, that our Quéene hath inwardly conceiued for the losse of the most braue accomplisht man of the worlde, who in her defence, behaued himselfe with such vallor against her foes, that in hers, and all our iudgements and opinions, hee through the world may not bee equalized for magnanimitie. And not long since hauing by the mighty prouidence of God, escaped many & imminent daungers, sayling hether with a mighty army of braue soldiers, for our rescue, a suddaine tempest arising at sea, he with his warlike company, were enforced to commit thēselues to the mercy of the waues, which at that instant, threatened naught but death, and destruction to them all. But thankes be to the highest heauens, not long since a pilgrime passenger, dryuē bytēpest vpō this our coast, brought vs the most happiest tidings, that we could desire, & which bred more content to our Quéene, then all the worlde could afforde, (which was) that at his departure from the City of Cassidony, the chiefe Citie of our aduersarie Alimodes, this braue man at armes, named Blanchardine, & the mightie Prince Sadony sonne to the King of Spruse, were not only landed there with a most puisaunt army of resolute knights, Gentlemen and soldiers, but had vanquished and slaine, our mortall enemy Darius, sacked his City and people, and that by the procurement of Blanchardine, the Prince Sadony had wedded the beautifull Lady Beautrix (Alimodes daughter) by whose right heis now fully possessed with the signiory and kingdome of Cassidony, the which he gouerneth with all tranquility, peace and happines, being (not only himselfe, by the honorable perswasion of Blanchardine become christned) but also hath established the true religiō of Christianity through the whole Country, to the honor of God, and the great commendation of him, and all his adherents.
               When the Prouost had thus discoursed at large to Blanchardine the message and report of the pilgrime, Blanchardine made this reply, that what the pilgrim had said, was most true, sauing in one thing, that whereas the pilgrim informed, that Sadony is or shall be married, to the faire Beautrix Alimodes daughter, that (quoth he) is vtterly false, in mistaking the man, for it is Blanchardine
                  
that shall espouse her, and he it is that hath sent me hiher, in succour and ayde to your Queene of Tormaday.
               
               Ah very God (quoth the Prouost) and can it be, that so Noble a Gentleman as Blanchardine is, shoulde so much dishonor and forget himselfe, to be affianced to any but our Queene, whose loyall loue, hath neuer receiued with any (but him) neither spot or fellowship, and who for his sake, hath vtterly refused and set at naught the royall proffers of many and mighty Kings? No, no sir, neither can I be brought to beleiue that any such thought can harbour in the head of that heroyike knight, neither woulde I for milions of gold, be the reporter of this vnhappy newes to hermaiestie, being well assured, that vpon the relation, naught but death could end her calamities.
               Therefore noble Gentleman, either dispatch me hence, with more happy newes, or neuer suffer me to returne, with such heauy tydings. Yet since it hath pleased you to relate vnto me, that your cōming hither (in the behalfe of our Queene) is by the speciall procurement and sending of Blanchardine, let me intreate you to know, whether hee haue recommended himselfe to my Lady by letter or no, that therein she may perceiue the full of his determination.
               Fréend (quoth Blanchardine) I neither receiued from him letter nor other message, sauing such as I haue already acquainted you withall, neyther can I imagine, what better contentment he could bring her, then the sending of me, to enfranchize and set her and her people at libertie, from the thraldome wherein shee and they haue long continued, vnder the feare of Alimodes force.
               Alas quoth the Prouost may it so bee that hee can forget the Princely loue and beauty of our Queene, who esteeming him far aboue al kings, sent him her good Courfer, & one of her sleeues at his encounter with his foes (The rather by that meanes) to manifest the integrity of her true affection to him, whose only grace, hath battered the bulwarke of her Addamanted brest: and whose loue shall neuer dissolue except death finish it?
               At the
                     •…
                   speaches, Blanchardine tickled with a swéete conceipt began to 
                     〈◊〉
                  , which the Prouost attentiuely marking and remembring

the letter sent by him to the Queene, coniectured presently that he was Blanchardine, although, the accustomed coullor, which his face was painted with, made him stand in some dout. But after a while, lēding a more listninge are to his talke, he presently knew, that it was he in deed, whereof hee became so ioyfull, that hee thought him selfe the happiest man on earth: and then began the Prouost more boldly to recount vnto him the extremitie of affection his Quéene had borne him, euer since his departure frō 
                  Tormaday, & since the receit of 
                     •…
                  is letter which he deliuered to the Prouost at sea, considering the strange accedent, that then happened by the tempest, fearing least hee had beene drowned, brought her into such a heauy plight, that she hath not beene séene abroad, amongst her Lords, only delighting to be sollitary in her Chamber, brooking no pleasure, neyther taking delight in any thing whatsoeuer.
               Then Blanchardine after some little parley, humbly recōmending him to ye good grace of ye Quéene by him, & to deliuer her Maiestie a ring of gold (which she verie well knew) & further to let her vnderstand, & since the darkning drew on so fast, that the day would not giue leaue to land his men▪ he with his braue company, would the next morning withall de
                     •…
                  terity come ashore, and bid Alimodes to such a breakfast, that instéed of fresh victualls, he should féede vppon the slaughtered carcasses of his owne people. And that his ordinance shoulde ring him such a knill, that hee might imagine all the Diuels of hell were come to salute him from his Son. But for mysloyalty to her maiestie, will her not to dout, for sooner shall the Sunne leaue to shine, and lighten the earth, then that my plighted troth shal falsefie his faith to her sacred selfe.
            
            
               
               Chap. 6.
               
                  Of the extreame ioy which the Queene had vppon the deliuerie of the ring, and the Prouostes message from Blanchardine.
                  
               
               
                  THe diligent & trusty Prouost, flying wt the wings of hope, tooke againe his boate, longing greatly till hee had reacht the shore, that hee might deliuer these glad tidinges to the Queene, whome hee left in a most pensiue case, plunged betwéene hope and dread. But at length by the industrious paine of the sailers, hee was safely set a shore, verie nere the posterne of the towne, where he proudly entred, whose comming had been long and long expected, not only of the Lordes that were priuy to his departure, but especially of the Quéene, who burned with extreame desire, to vnderstand some happy newes. Now the Prouost being entred the presence, humbling himselfe on his knée, the Quéene (with more then her accustomed pace) came against him, to gratulate his welcome.
               Then the Prouost began to deliuer his message in these tearmes: (Renowned Lady and my most gracious Princesse) know that I haue according to your Princely commaund, performed my ambassage to the generall of the Royall Nauy, that floteth héereby on the Sea before the City: of the which the chiefe conductors and rulers be, the Noble King of Frize, Blanchardine
                   his Sonne, and the braue Sadonye, Sonne to the king of Spruse, besides a braue company of warlike soldiers, whose couragious vallors presage victorie to your Maiestie. And more, the noble King of Frize, hath sworne the vtter ouerthrow of Alimodes, and all his cursedra bble of miscreants, for the extreame and deadly wrong which haue béene done to him by Darius his Sonne: And therefore Madam, this is their request, that since the day is

almost spent, so that they may not Land conueniently, they will vs with all our strength, early on the next morning, to be ready at their arriuall, where and when without further delay, they meane presently to set vppon your enimies, their corages being augmented, by the equitie of your and their quarel. So that now (most mighty Princes) there is no cause left vs, of longer dispaire, but that all possible and spéedy prouision be made, for the ioyning of our forces together against the appointed time.
               Then pulling foorth the ring, which gaue sufficient testimony to the Quéene of Blanchardines presence, he most humbly recommended it to her maiesties handes, as his charge was from Blanchardine.
               
               The Quéene most thankfully receiued this heauenly present, from Blanchardine, humbly thanking God that in her greatest extreames hee had sent not only succour, but also the man whome vnder heauen she estéemed most: then giuing especiall charge to the Prouost and all her nobles, to sée all things in a readines against the next morning, at the houre appointed: shée calling her Nurse, went into her bed chamber, where they two discoursed at large, of the truth, vallor and kingly prowes of Blanchardine, and all other accidents, and succour that God had sent them, but the chiefe note they sung vpon, was Blanchardine whose swéete accent, vpheld the diapasan of their musicke.
               After this she gaue in charge▪ that the streetes should be hanged with costly clothes, and that the swéetest musicke shoulde continually play, to welcome her loue Blanchardine, which was presently effected, so that the City séemed rather an earthly paradice, then a garison towne of soldiers, by reason of the melodious soundes of all sortes of instruments, the sweet voices of men and women, the musicall hermonies of Clarions, Simballs, Lutes, Hoboyes, Cornets and trumpets that then were heard.
               The Bels began to ring throughout the Citie, the Preistes to sing procession, the boyes to make bonefires, and the maides to chaunt their Roundelayes, that al mourning laid aside, there was no cause of discomsiture to be seene.
               Now the King Alimodes being at supper within his Pauilion,

as though the foure Elements had encountred together. The dust began to rise so thicke that it almost dimd the brightnes of the Sunne, by reason whereof, they within the City perceiued not their freindes from their enemies. Then went the Noble Quéene and all the matrons of Tormaday, barefooted, to the Churches from one to an other, exorating the powers of heauen to strengthen the paizaunce of Blanchadine▪
                   and all his associates, and to confound the misbeléeuing infidels, Almodes and his companies.
               After these orizons finished, the Quéene calling her nurse, mounted vp into her gallerie, from whence she might well perceiue the assaults on both sides, where shee long beheld diuers Knights and soldiers flaine, others dismounted from their horses, sore mangled and wounded, wallowing in their owne gore, their horses running vp and downe, without their guides and riders. But in this hotte skirmish, Blanchardine singled foorth a Duke, a man of great account and prowes, whome at the first méeting with his Launce, he sent dead to the ground. And before his Launce brake, he confounded fiue or six. And folowing his happie entrance, he so behaued himselfe, that his sword was too well knowne among the Pagans, for he had altered the Azure cullor thereof, into a crimson red, with the blood of the foe, so that happie was he that might rid himselfe from Blanchardine: sury. And if Alimodes had not supplied the defectiue troopes of his slaughtered soldiers, with a band often thousand fresh, the day had on his side bene turnd to night, vpon which began the clamor oft he soldiers to eccoe in the sky, when giuing each other the fresh onset, the battell seemed more feirce then at the first. But Blanchardine (instigated with honor and loue) still hazarded himselfe among the thickest of his enimies, whome they knew too well for their profits. And being enclosed within a ring of pagans, they freshly assayled him on euery side, eyther to slay him or make him their captiue, which cruelties, he (hauing before too well experimented) rather determined to die, then to bee taken prisoner. And in this resolution, hee so coragiously behaued himselfe, that none durst enter within the reach of his weapon. And

although his horse was sore wounded, and him selfe most daungerously hurt in many places, not séeing any way to encounter such a multitude without great danger, yet with maine force he retired himselfe back among his companie.
               Now Sadony who all this while stood not idle, singled out a mightie Giaunt named Corhorant, second brother to the King Alimodes, whome vpon the shock, at their encounter, hee sent both horse and man to the ground, and accepting the benefit of fortune and time, alighted from his horse and disseuered hys head from his body. The good king of Frize whose corage was strong (although by reason of age) his body was weake, what by his encoragement of the soldiers, and great experience in feates ofarmes, did great damage to Alimodes and his soldiers: In the meane the valiant Blanchardine, féeling his horse (by reason of his woundes to faint vnder him) alighted and betooke himselfe to his sword, with the which he so manfully behaued himselfe as euer did any knight, till at the last the enemy perceiuing him dismounted, pressed so fast by heapes vpon him that they tooke him prisoner. At which suddaine applause, the whole troope of miscreants gaue a mightie shoote, but Sadony perceiuing the distressed case of his trusty friend Blanchardine, hasted so fall vppon the enimy with his company, that heaset at libertie him, that before they thought to be most sure prisoner. When Blanchardine saw himselfe free, he presently mounted a fresh horse, & tooke a mighty Launce. And perceiuing Alimodes somewhat distant from his companie, gaue the spurres to his horse, and by his agillitie and mightie prowes bare him out of his saddell to the earth And at that instant had seuered his head from his body, had not spéedy succour come. This foile bred such a desire of reuenge in Alimodes, that so soone as he was mounted againe, he wasted Blanchardine to the second encounter, which he most willingly condecended vnto, in regard of the honor he should atchiue by his conquest. And as before, so he serued him the second time for had not Alimodes béene rescued againe, he had sēt his soule to Carons ferry bote, to passe him ouer Phlegiton, to craue his wādring pasport of Eacus, Minos and Radamant, to the infernall bloody marshal

fieldes.
               Now the Quéene of Tormaday (who as I said before) stoode with her nurse in the gallery window, perceiuing plainely this braue combat, betweene Blanchardine and the King Alimodes which bred her most sweet content: She foorthwith called vnto her a young Knight, whome she commaunded presently to deliuer a white dammask sleeue (which she pulled from her gowne) with her kindest commendations to Blanchardine, requesting him for her sake, not ouly to weare the same, but also to alter the cullor, with the blood of her enemie Alimodes.
               
               The young knight hauing receiued this ambassage from the Quéene, spéedily posted to deliuer it to Blanchardine, vnto whom being aproched, he presented both the Quéenes commendations and the sleeue.
               This vnexpected present, was more welcome to Blanchardine, then a million of gold, who receiuing it with all humilitie and kindnes, promised the performance of her maiesties commaund, so far foorth as both his life and currage shoulde permit, not forgetting most humbly to commend him to the good grace of the Quéene: with which fréendly answer the messenger after his bountifull reward from Blanchardine, returned.
               Now Blanchardine (whome this princely fauour made most forward) with eger desire of victory, entred presently the thickest of his enemies, where he so brauely behaued himselfe, that few or none durst approch his presence for feare of death, which Sadony and the residue of his company perceiuing, pressed the more forward for his ayd. And not long after, through the ingenious capasitie and magnonimious courrage of Blanchardine, and the noble Sadony, Alimodes and his miscreant troope being discomforted, began to betake themselues to flight, hauing in that battell lost the greater part of his soldiers.
               
                  Sadony the young Prince perceiuing Alimodes and his companies to be discomforted and to fly, pursued them so fast in their flight, that on the suddaine he ouertooke a mightie man named Gallizeus, third brother to Alimodes, whome he so saluted with his sword, that he fell dead from his horse. But when Alimodes
                  
perceiued his brother slaine, & by the prowes of one only Knight, with extreame anger hee commaunded all his vassailes at once to set vpon him, who long time most māfully defended himselfe: but finding his horse to faint vnder him, by reason of his many woundes, was constrained to alight, and not able long to endure the force of so many enemies, was enforced to yeild, and had at that instant béene slaine had not Alimodes charged vpon paine of death, that hee should be taken aliue, to cause him to endure a more miserable end.
               Now the clamor of the Pagans began excéedingly at the taking of the Prince Sadony, so that the noyses rung in the eares of Blanchardine, and when the company had certified him thereof, he stayed not, but with all celeritie posted towards the enemie to recouer him, but Alimodes and his folke perceiuing them at hand, got them aboord their ships with all possible speed they might, but a number of them were cut off before they might reach the Sea, and cruelly murdered. But when they perceiued that Alimodes was already ascended his ships, and had Sadony aboord him, hee galloping on the strond with a lofty voice, called to Alimodes, to raunsome his friend Sadony, with a hundreth thousand crownes and six thousand of his Pagan prisoners, but Alimodes replyed that hee should not returne, except the faire Quéene Eglantine might be his raunsome, where vnto Blanchardine replyed that he would vpon condition that Sadony, might come ashore. But the false Panim Alimodes, fearing the losse of his prisoner, commaunded his sayles to be presently hoysed, the ships to Launce, and bend their course to Cassidony, hauing a little gale ready to carry them away.

                     BLanchardine perceiuing no recouery of his true and trusty companion Sadony, out of the handes of the Pagan Alimodes, pinched with exceeding anguish and sor row ofminde, with teares trickling dowen his watery eies, he began to complaine in this manner.
               Ah mutable and vnconstant fortune, how doost thou vomit vp the venome of thy rigor vpon mée, whome euen now thou madest the best contentedst man liuing, and in a moment the accursedst wretch that breatheth: thou hast bereft me of the second solace of my soule, in depriuing mee of the companie of my Sadony whose presence was my earthly heauen, whose absence my infernall hell. O Noble Gentleman, sprung from the Loines of victorious kings, how may I worthily bewaile this your disaster, who for mysake, & in my quarrel, haue not only forsaken father, friends, kindred, country, landes dominions & liuing but also not shunning most cruell and iminent daunger (euen at hand) haue most willingly aduentured your lise and person.

                   soldiers, the trusty followers of sweet Sadony, sad and sorrowsully wringing

their wretched hands, for the losse of their prince, in beholding them (I say) my passions are more and more augmented, neither can any ioy possesse my soule, by reason of his mishap.
               After he had thus heauily bewayled his déere fréend, hee approching néere the place where Sadonyes soldiers marched, trayling their pikes behinde thē, he began to recomfort them the best he could, commaunding all the spoyles of the Pagans, to bee equally distributed amongst them, & that nothing should be wanting, to supply their necessities, and that all their shippes should presently be new rigged and victualed, intending foorthwith to post after them, to deliuer their prince and his companiō 
                  Sadony.
               
               Nowe was the beautifull Eglantine Quéene of Tormaday, come before Banchardine to yéeld him humble thankes for his excéeding paines, and true valor shewed in her seruice, altogether ignorant of all sinister accidents touching the captiuitie of Sadony: at whose approch, the virmillion red did so bepaint his manlike face, that euery one might well perceiue the integritie of his affection by his countenance: on the other side the Quéene taken (as it were with an Apoplexie) was for the time like one in a trance, not able through excéeding loue to vtter a woord, till Blanchardine taking her betwéene his armes, seizing vpon her rosial lips with a swéete kisse, had a little reuiued her, then comming to her selfe, shee woulde faine haue spoken, but yet was tung-tide, onely suffering her eyes to bée the true messengers of her thought. But Blanchardine breaking silence began in this manner.
               Most bewtifull Quéene and my redoubted loue and mistres, as health doth bring most sollace to the sicke, libertie to the prisoner, and foode to the hungry, so doth your Angelicall presence reuiue mée, who (euen now▪ the extremitie of sorrow had almost confounded. The Sunshine of my blisse, was turned to a cloudie fogge, my mirth to mone, my sollace to sadnes, and my day to night, in loosing the man whome heauen adores, whome earth admires, and men doe reuerence. O that the dismall day had bin obscured, when first this hellish Tirant Alimodes, bent his bloody forces against this royall Towne, wherein although he hath

acquired small aduantage, yet hath subdued his Conquerer, in surprising that most heroick Prince Sadony, whome nowhe leadeth prisoner to Cassidony: but what auailes sorrowe, where sadnes cannot helpe, and though I now enioy your companye, which is a heauen vnto my soule, and a paradice vnto my mind, yet since the cause was mine, the quarrell mine, and he himself was mine: with what honor or iust excuse, can or may I suffer him to endure imprisonment, and liue my selfe free and out of bondage? (pardon me O gracious Quéene) and with your pardon ioyntly giue me leaue to recouer him again, without whom neither may my hart receiue content, neither my soule comfort: and the time shall not be long, vntill I make my speedy returne to visite you, whom aliue aboue all wights I honor, and whome after death I vowe as my cheefest saint to adore.
               When the proude Lady in loue faire Eglantine, had till this instant remained as it were in a traunce, yet listened to this sad and heauy discourse of Blanchardine, where at the first a wan and pale hew had wholy possessed her amiable face, by reason of her inward passions: now the orient vermillion spreading on her cheekes, stroue (as it were) with the Rose and Lillie for superiority in the perfection of colour, she calling her sences together, made this reply. Ah poore and distressed Quéene, how often in my greatest mishaps was I wont to alledge against fortune, when she threatned vtterly to depriue me of honor, liuing, renowne, yea life and all, that none of al that was mine, claiming onely a property in thy loue and loyaltie (O noble Knight Blanchardine) not caring to forgoe the whole worlde so I might enioy thée whome I thought that neither alteration of time, distance of place, mutation of manners, change of estate, no nor any thing whatsoeuer which either hell or fortune might procure, could once haue seperated and withdrawne from me, (hauing now such liberty and freedome to stay:) but seeing that my expectation failes me, and that I striue against the streame, and east stones against the winde, in reconciling you, and opposing my selfe against fortune, who long since hath vowed my vtter ruine: ah too true I finde, that the constellation of my starres,

with the calculation of my natiuitie, haue still alotted me, with Ixion to be rolled on the tormenting whéele, dayly to turne the stone with Sisiphus, and for euer to fill the bottomlesse tubs with the daughters of Belus: the ashes of the olde Phenix ingender a new, and with me the end of one sorrowe is the beginning of another: if fortune looke on me she lowreth, if she turne her face, she threatneth: if she but remember me, she is enraged: and if she smile, she meaneth naught but deceit and slatterye. And yet how can I so vehemently exclaime against fortune? hath she not rescued me from the Pagans tirannies? hath she not preserued my swéete Blanchardine from shipwrack, imprisonment, and death? hath she not giuen me the conquest and ouerthrow of my enemies? Alas she hath, but so soone to depriue me of thy swéet company, augmenteth my gréefes a thousand times more, then these haue exhillerated me with pleasure: yet since there is no remedy and that you needes will wend from hence to hazard your life and people, in rescuing him (whome I thinke they haue already put to death) and leaue me (to whom your absence will bring a discontentment worse then death) goe Blanchardine goe, and in your absence I will mourne, wéepe, and wring my hands, (but withall) neuer cease to entreate the Gods for your speedy returne: and yet before you goe, let vs congratulate our selues as well as we may, and so short a time will permit: and after you haue put on the Princely Diadem of Tormaday, and establisht all things according to your grauety and wisedome, thē (I say) may you at your pleasure departe, and leaue me héere to bewaile my hard misfortune.
               Thus this poore passionate Quéene sometime with sighes, sometime with teares, solicited him to stay, but his brotherly care of Sadony farre exceeded the Quéenes perswasions. So pacing louingly with her into the Cittie, which he found most sumptuouslye adorned against his comming, he sported with his fayre Quéene a day or two, till his shipping was in a readines, and then with a warlike company of braue Caualiers, he bent his course after the Pagan Alimodes, and his miscreant company: but before he ascended the Ship, he in presence of the Queene

and her Lords, called vnto him a man (whome as he thought was highest in the Princes fauour) but yet of base and meane parentage, onely aduanced to honor by the late deceased King of Tormaday, Father to the Quéene, whose aduice and councel he continually vsed before al the Lords of his kingdome, his name was Subbyon, whose pride and haughtye minde, procured him much hatred among ye nobles, but by reason of his offices which he helde vnder the Quéene, by the appointment of her father, the common and baser sorte of people, (more for feare then loue) did reuerence: whome Blanchardine by reason of his short abode, chose rather by his eye then by experience, to be vicegerent of the Cittie and kingdome till his returne: this hee did (as hee thought) to please the Quéene, & appointed a hundreth knightes daily to attend his person and commaund. When Blanchardine had disposed (as ha thought) all things according to the Quéenes desire, after millions of kisses, and sweet imbracements of the faire Eglantine, with wéeping teares hee departed towardes his ships.
               Then the aged king of Frize, father to Blanchardine, séeing the pitifull complaints of the Quéene, recomforted her as well as he could, promising after the obtaining of their enterprize, to bring againe withall spéed his sonne vnto her. Ah God graunt (answered the Quéene) that all thinges sort vnto your wils, for in your absence is my death, and in your presence is my ioy.
               Then the King of Frize and all the rest went aboord their ships, the ankers were halled, the sayles were hoised, and foorth they launcht into the déep, where after a daies saile, they might escry afar off, a mightie nauy of shippes, glyding on the waues, whereof newes being brought to Blanchardine, he commaunded that presently the maisters should post after them, thinking it to be the fléete of Alimodes. But when the industryous Pilotts thought to reach the other company, they were presently ouertaken with a mighty tempest, which put them without their compasse, and in great peril of their liues. The marriners perplexed with the agony and fear of death, could not execute their charge, but encoraged by the captaines of euer shippe, they began to doe

their labour, some turned the sayle yard, others the sayle corde, others strooke the topsayles, others the spritsayle, some the mysen sayle, some tooke off the bonnets and enlargements of the mainesayles, some knit the broken lines, and some looked to the hinder decke tayle & castle of the ship, some to the fore decke and some to the hatches, others voyded the sea into the sea by pumping the water out of the ships. And to be short, euery man applyed him so well to his labour, that they defended the storme without losse of any. And thus let vs leaue to speake of them a while and returne to Subbion, whome we left gouernor of Tormaday.
               
            
            
               Chap. 9.
               
                  How in the absence of Blanchardine, Subbion, to whō the gouerment of Tormaday, was committed til his returne, traiterously conspired to marie the Queene and set himselfe in the regall throne as King.
               
               
                  
                     SVbbion being left, by the special appointment of Blanchardine, chéefe commaimder of the City and people of Tormaday, assending not by steps, but on the sodaine to the tipe of all honor (as he thought) pricked forward by ambition and pride, the handmaides of trechery, began to imagine with himselfe, how he might for euer establish this his signiory and gouerment, neither respecting his base and rude parentage, the manifold and bountifull rewards of the Quéene, nor the assured trust reposed in him, by his soueraigne Blanchardine. Calling therefore before him such as (he thought) and whome hee might either by reward, bribe or promise of honor, allure, or by flattery perswade, with whome he began to breake in this manner.
               My approued friends and faithfull countrimen, you are not ignorant of the long and teadious wars which we haue for many

into the presence, where the Quéene sate, attended but with a small troope of Lords and Knights, found her pensiue and sad, for the departure of Blanchardine: but Subbion imboldned by reason of his armed fréendes, that companied him, leading the Quéene a little a side (as though hee would impart some matter of more secrecie, then behooued the standers by to be acquainted withall, began to parley with her in this manner.
               Faire Quéene and Empresse of Tormaday, your subiects and Citizens are greatly grieued, to sée you dolant and sad, now you haue most cause to laugh and be merry. And so far as they, and my selfe both by your spéeches & our own coniectures can gather your melancholy ariseth, by meanes of the absence of Blanchardine a man though forward in your seruice (in hope of Sallary) yet a stranger, an exiled person, and a fugitiue. And sith you haue forsaken so many Princely offers, of Emperors, Kinges, Princes, Dukes, and great Lordes, it is a great wonder to vs all, what folly or rather frenzie should leade you, to dote so much vpon this wandering Knight, whom both his owne country and people do hate, and who (in all our opinions) séeketh nothing but the subuertion of you and this our common wealth: consider (noble Quéene) the honor of your Royall house, from whence you are descended, the fertilitie of the Realme, wherein you raigne, and the welfare of the people, whome you gouerne, and suffer not your self to be so vainly led to mary one, who like the traitor Eneas, will not onely depopulate your country, impouerish your people, but in your extreamest néed, leaue and forsake you, hauing obtained the ful & effect of his desire. Then (noble Quéene) it will be too late to recal againe, what preuention in time may firmely establish. And since it is the generall desire of all your subiects, and the thing which not only shall bring content to all, but continue peace within your dominions for euer, that you assure your loue and liking to mée, who estéeme thereof aboue all reach of human wit. Consent (O gracious Quéene) to satisfie the humble desire of all, in yéelding that your loue to mée, which the 
                     〈◊〉
                   of my affection doth iustly chalenge, as proper to none 
                     〈◊〉
                   my selfe. And héere I vow and protest (before the sacred

presence of the imortall God) to take such continuall and diligent care for the saftie of your selfe, your realme and people, that through all ages Tormaday, shall beare the name of the most blessed and happiest country vnder the Sunne. And if you gainesay, what all haue affirmed, touching our mariage: know that what I may not obtaine by your free consent, I beth will and can effect by rigor and force. Therefore sweet Lady resolue mée presently, what your determination is herein, that I may befully ascertiated of your meaning.
               The Quéene (hauing with extreame paine) listened to the sequell of Subbions purpose, began nowe to chaunge her countenaunce, and with an austere and bold spirit, full of magnanimitie and disdaine, made this reply.
               What do I hear (thou base disloyall villaine) to procéed out of thy lips whome duty commaunds to be our footestoole and slaue? haue the honors which we haue bestowed vpon thée, made thée so far to forget thy selfe, that thou darest presume to solicite such a matter, as thy installation in regall seate, and to be fellow and copartner with me? Auaunt pesant, this thy malleport and sawcy enterprize, shall cause thée to repent thy trechery, and bring such deserued punishment vpon thée, that through all regions, thy detestable villanies shall bee bruted, and here at home thy cursed carcase most cruelly tortured.
               And as she entended to call her counsell, to acquaint thē with this detestable treason: imediatly there stepped in, a multitude of base runagates, which being [on set purpose] armed for his rescue, they commaunded their Prince the faire Eglantine, to consumate ye marriage, which they had already purposed betwéene her and Subbion, not permitting her any leisure to withdraw her selfe apart, from such a rude rabbell of rascalls.
               The Ladies there attēdant, perceiuing ye multitude to presse in so fast, made such an outery, that all the Court and streetes rung of their noyse, so that the Citizens wondring at this suddaine allarum, began to flock to the gates of the Court which were so clo
                     •…
                  ly kept by the traytorous companies of Subbion, that none might [as then] enter therein.
               
                  But this newes being spred through the City, and comming to the eares of the good olde Earle of Castelford, the Prouost of Tormaday, and the Knight of the ferry: sitting at diner, they hauing vnderstood the treasons, intended by Subbion against the Queene, withall possible spéed, assembed a mightie army of soldiers & citizens, 
                     •…
                  n battle aray, & marched to the court gates, which though at the first they found fast shut, yet by the engines and deuices they brought, they caused to fly open, so that within short time [& ere euer Subbion could any whit effect his purpose] they entred the Court, where finding the Quéene, somewhat recoiled, and seuered from the company of the traitors, which now prepared to defend themselues, they presently conueyed her out of the Court, and with al possible spéed, sent her away to the old Earle of Castelford there to remaine til their return vnto her.
               In the meane while, Subbion and his accomplicies withdrew themselues, fearing the multitude of the Citizens and soldiers, which came against them. But when hee vnderstood, that the faire Lady Eglantine, was by the Prouost, the Knight of the ferry, and the good Earle of Castelford, conueyed to the stronge holde of Castelford, a place impregnable, by reason of ye déep watry trenches, and lofty stronge walles, being furnished within with great store of munition, men and victualls, hee grew halfe in dispaire, euer to obtaine his purpose. But being incoraged by his treacherous followers, to persist in his villanous enterprize, he forthwith, with all his base retinue, marched to Castelford, where hauing a long and weary seidge, without aduauntage, he determined still to perseuer therein, hoping in time, through want and defect of victualls, they should bee reinforced to yéeld. And in this assault and traitorous seidge, I will leaue him a while, to recount the aduenture of Blanchardine in persuit of the Pagan Alimodes, for the deliuerie of his trustie companion Sadony.

                  NOw was Alimodes (the cursed infidel) come safe within the hauen of Cassidony his natiue country and kingdome, (as he thought but hauing landed his men, entending to enter the City, as King, he found the gates closed, and all enterance was denied: then he began first to exclaime vpon his false Gods, then on his people, and most especially, on his daughter, the faire Beautrix, who was lately affianced, to the distressed prisoner Sadony: at the same instant, was the fair Beautrix mounted in her gallery, from whence she might discerne the huge multitude of Ships and men, which much recomforted her, hoping them to be the company of her Lord Sadony, whose presence and safe returne she had ouer long expected: she forthwith commaunded a great Lord to poste abroad to bring her the certainty of the newes, who being returned, assured her that it was her father Alimodes, who by chaunce of war, driuen from his siedge had taken her betrothed Lord Sadony prisoner, and entended the next morning to sacrifice him to his Pagan Gods. This melancholy message bred such a terror to the faire Beawtrix when she heard the distresse of her déere Sadony, that all vitall powers forsaking her body, she fell in a sound: but being recomforted by the diligence of her Ladies, she came to her selfe again, when not without millions of teares she bewailed the hard mischaunce of Sadony, whose case she thought remedilesse: Alimodes aduancing himselfe neerer the walles, perc

you: But fearing your rage (which I know to be gréeuous and intollerable) if on the sodaine without deliberation you should enter, and beholde the strange mutations and chaunges, which haue chaunced in your absēce.

               The enraged King knowing himselfe (Sans reamedy) kept silence, to heare what his daughter would alleadge, which shee perceiuing, began to speake in this sort.
               Noble King and my redouted father, when I bethinke mée of the manyfold and greeuous offences, which you, and all wee through you, haue committed against the sacred maiesty of God, in honoring that detestable and cursed Idoll Mahomet, whose duty is nothing, and power lesse▪

                   driuen into such a desperate & sorrowfull imagination for my soule, that euery thought is far worse then a thousand deathes vnto mée. But when I recall myselfe, and veiue the merits and mercies of christ, the true immortall and euer liuing God, whome euen now, and during my life I will adore, I am much recomforted from these sad and pensiue gréefes: looke father, looke with the eye of cōscience, 
                     〈◊〉
                   the damnable heresies you maintaine: and with spéed forsake that infernall Mahomet, and his irreligious Altaron, and bend your deuotions to Christ, in whome there is mercy and forgiuenes. And deere Father relent, and mittigate your conceiued wrath to Sadony my true Lord and husband, and ioyne in leage and amitie, with those two vallerrous Gentlemen and Princes, Sadony and Blanchardine, So shall you enter these gates [as Emperor] and al we during our liues wil remaine the true and trustie subiectes and friends of Alimodes, hereby shall your tranquilitie be established, your people pacified, and your Country cōtinually floorish. And if this receipt seeme too hard for your disgestion, and that vnder these conditions you will not tie your honor, then in dispight of thée and thy false Mahomet, I swear by the immortall god, rather to die, & suffer this city to perish, thē that once thou shalt finde footing here. This is the sōe of my resolutiō therfore aduise your self, what answere you entēd to make.
               
                  When Alimodes had heard the imperious discourse of his daughter the faire Beawtrix, with an impiteous grace and angry countenance, he made this reply. Thou accursed caitife and hellish hagge, is this the duty and obeysance which nature commaunds thée to doe to thy father? is this the reward of all my cost and paines, which from thy cradle I haue bestowed vpon thée? is this the faith thou gauest me, to reserue thy virginitie to be disposed at my pleasure? thou monster in nature, thou vngratfull féende, and periurde miscreant, neither doe I meane vpon thy foolish entreaty, nor thy vaine boastings, to forsake my God Mahomet, neither to suffer this villaine Sadony (whome thou callest husband) to escape the tortures which presently thou shalt sée prepared for him: and in this agony he commaunded the Marshall of his hoast to cause forthwith a lofty Iibbet to be erected, right before the windowe where faire Beawtrix leand, that she might behold the heauy spectacle, of the death of Sadony her Lord.
               But when Beawtrix perceiued her perswasions to take no effect, and that the obstinate Alimodes perseuered in his diuelish determinations, she began thus to exclaime against him.
               Thou false miscreant, vnmercifull tyrant, and olde dotard, dost thou think that this thy rigour can work thy entrance within this Cittie? no no, thou art deceiued, and I will cause thée (if thou persist in this obstinacy) to repent thy arriual before Cassidony, to disturbe my people and quiet: pack hence I charge thée on paine of thy life, before my anger be further incenst against thée, & goe againe I say to woo that beautiful Quéene of Tormaday, who regardeth thée worse thē her basest slaue. Thou sottish olde man, that once wert Venus Chamberlaine, but now art become Cupeds Chaplaine: doost thou imagine that so faire a Princesse can dote on so foule a wizard? or dost thou thinke to obtaine her loue by force, who lothed to looke vpon thy filthy face? those wrinckles in thy browes, those hoary haires on thy visage, those quaking handes which cal thée to thy graue, do tel thée thy labour is in vaine, and thy cost is consumed to naught: leaue, leaue, silly man, these vntimely and vnnaturall courses of loue,

and repaire to 
                     〈◊〉
                   hermitage or solitarie cell, where thou maiest haue both time and leasure, to repent thy youthfull toyes, and aged follies. And suffer my husband to escape thy murthering handes, whose death as it can aduantage thée but a little, so his life may perchance ere long ransome thine.
               These reprochfull tantes of his daughter, made the olde King almost mad, and in that humor, he commaunded his soldiers and Captaines presently to giue a sharpe assault to the Towne, which forthwith was effected to the great losse of Alimodes, and hys companies.
               And when he saw, that neither by commaund, by partey nor byforce he could affect what he desired, he charged his men to retire themselues to their tents, where hauing a thousand doutes hammering in his head, and many deuices how hee might be reuenged on the faire Beautrix his daughter, hee willed all his trumpets and clarions to sound, the rather (as he thought) to greiue his daughter, by his feined shew of victorie. But when he found all his deuices to faile, and all his forces to effect nothing, he charged the marshall foorthwith, to leade Sadony to execution, vnder the gard of foure thousand soldiers.
               
                  Sadony being now brought towardes the place, where (as hee thought) hee should finish his heauy tragedy, began pittiously to bewayle his hard misfortune. And thinking first vppon Blanchardine, and before him séeing his wife faire Beautrix, standing in her window, to view this heauy spectacle, his passions dyd more and more encrease, so that through the anguish of his grief his spirits began to fayle, but being hurryed by the vnruly rabbell of Pagans to his death, he began to entreate thus. And is there neither pitty nor compassion remaining, amongst you, who thus violently draw me to death? Can neither my innocency, nor my ransome purchase my pardon at your handes? O noble Blanchardine, whose name I cannot forget▪ what disaster is this, that hauing escaped so many daungers in thy company I should die thus cruelly in thy absence: haue I forsaken my father, country and friendes, to accompanie thée, in conquest of thy faire loue, and dost thou slack to succor me in this distresse? is

loue forgotten, is kindnes banished, is faith dissolued? O had thy

                   case bin mine neither loue nor life should haue stayed me from thy deliuery: and casting his eyes to the window where his Lady lay, hee fetching a porfouud sigh, as though his heart woulde breake, spake thus. O dismall day and most accursed fortune, haue I beene preserued from so many slaughters, to finish my daies, in presence of my deere and déerest wife? Could not other place or time bereaue me of my life, but before her sacred presence? O no, my fatall destinies haue thought it fit for my offences. And in these extreames he languished, vtterly voyde of any hope of succour. But the deuine powers pittying his passions, sent him spéedy remedie, as in the next Chapter you shall hear.

                  Howe the faire Beautrix rescued her husband Sadony from death, and mauger his enemies, brought him safe within the walles of the City of Cassidony.
                  
               
               
                  AS the beautifull Beautrix beheld this heauy spectacle of her loue and Lord Sadony, pacing (strōgly garded) to his death, she in all hast, descended the gallerie into the presence, where she found diuers Nobles and Gentlemen attending her pleasure: she desirous to speake, yet wanting force (by reason of her speede.) After a little pause, she humbling her helfe before them all, began to entreate them to succour her distressed Sadony, who is euen now [quoth she] almost come to the dismall place▪ where hee must finish his daies, vnlesse your corragious valors thaughtie prowes deliuer him. Reply my not lords [quoth

she] for the time will not permit, but vpon your allegance and loues to me, post a way with expedition, so shall I for euer acknowledge my selfe [though your Quéene] yet bound in duty vnto you all,
               This humilitie of the Quéene, with teares distilling downe her chéekes, was such a spur to the forward minds of her nobles, that presently, they marched out at a close postertie of the City through the drytrenches most secretly, till on the sodaine they were come very néere the place of execution.
               Now Sadony being mounted vp the ladder, by reason whereof he might ouerlooke the resedue, perceiuing this ambush to bee so néere, séeming to eleuate his handes to heauen for mercie, with maine force, brake the handes, where with hee was manakled. And leaping from the ladder, on the sodaine, caught holde on a holberd, which a rude rascall held, and violently wringing it out of his hands, he so bestired his stumps, that hee made the Sarizins recoyle back.
               Now the Lords of Cassidony, perceiuing the Sarizins disordered,, by reason of this escape of Sadoniy. They forthwith ran vpon them, with such agillety, that the Sarizens began to fly, and in their slight, the most part were eyther taken or slaine, by which pollecy and present meane, Sadony was throughly reseued from death, and brought within the walles of Cassidony, to the great and excéeding ioy of all the inhabitants the maine discemforture of Alimodes, and the sweet content of the Quéene.
               But when the faire Beautrix was aduertised of this happie newes, who all this while, was vpon her knoos, 
                     〈◊〉
                   praying to God, for Sadonies deliuerie & the good successe of her Lords she posted to welcome him. At whose presence shee [through extreame ioy] sounded.
               But Sadony gently listing vp her, drinking the brinish teares, which ran downe her chéekes, after a while brought her to her sences againe, when prostrating himselfe before her, he gaue her and all the rest, many thankes for his preseruation, but she lifting him vp, lead him with princely honor into the pallace; wher he discoursed the whole aduenture of Blanchardine and himselfe,

since his departure spom Cassidony.
               
               By this time and at that very instant, was the valerous Blanchardine with his coragious company, come within the hauen of Cassidony, where landing his men, artillery, and horses, he presently cōmaunded certaine espialls to scout abroad, to vnderstand the estate of Cassidony, and whether Alimodes was entred the City or no. By whose industry & diligence, they apprehēding a soldier of Alimodes host, brought him with speed before Blanchardine, who vpon his examination, confessed the state of Alimodes, the rescue of Sadony, and the exceeding ioy of faire Beautrix for his escape with life, at the instant houre expected of his death. These pleasing newes, sorting to his desire, reuiued the dying corage of Blanchardine, for the losse of his companyon Sadony. But now pricked forward with loue and reuenge he dispatched his letters by sundry postes, to aduertise Sadony of his arriuall, willing him forthwith, and or euer the enemy were better prouided, to ioyne his forces and assault them, himselfe meaning forthwith to giue the onset.
               These letters being come to the hands of Sadony, he presently acquainted the Lordes of Cassidony, and faire Beautrix with the contents, which they most thankfully accepting, slacked not to performe what pleased Sadony to commaund. And forthwith leuying forty thousād of expert soldiers, they secretly issued out of the Towne, to ioyne with Blanchardine and his company. By this time was Blanchardine ready to charge vpon the enemy, which when Sadony perceiued, he taried not long to assayle them on the other side.
               So began the fight to be excéeding daungerous: but the policie of Blanchardine, and prowes of Sadony, within short time, brought these wars to end. For Alimodes perceiuing his Pagans to fly, and his whole host to bée discomforted, and finding no remedy (by reason of the multitude of his aduersaries to escape) he disarming himselfe, came prostrate before Blanchardine pleading his pardon, whome Blanchardine, not according to his deserts, but of his accustomed clemencie pittying, deliuered him to the sure custody of a trusty Knight, to remaine his prisoner

till they might further determine vpon him.
               Now was Sadony and Blanchardine met, betweene whome passed such sweet salutations, & kind imbracementes as brought a singular content and pleasure to all their followers. So loueingly arme in arme they paced to the City, where the beautiful Beautrix euen at that very entrance met them with such a pleasant grace, as bright Phoebus yéeldes after he hath banished the morning mist. Then through the Citie were proclaimed feasts and triumphes, and al other kinds of sportes, to yéeld a plauditie to this successe, then was the day of Coronation sounded through the land, at which time the Dukes, Lordes, Earles, Barrons, Knights & Gentlemen, from all places, assembled at Cassidony to honor the festiualls. The whole assembly made their homage and fealty to Sadony & Quéene Beautrix: & from that time foorth a quiet and fréendly peace was fully established through that region.
               After that Blanchardine had reposed himselfe, and his weary soldiers awhile, in the kind company of Sadony, and his faire Beautrix, he whome the entire loue of faire Eglantine did still recall to Tormaday, commaunded his ships to be made ready for his returne, ignorant altogether of the treacherous conspiracies of Subbion in his absence, which (if he had knowne) nothing could haue stayd him from her deliuerie and his reuenge. But he not so much as once coniecturing any such accident, made the lesse hast to depart, from this new crowned king and Quéene of Cassidony.

                  How faire Eglantine the proude Lady in loue, being beseidged by the traitor Subbiou, within the Castell of Castelford sent the trustie Prouost of Tormaday to certifie Blanchardine thereof, being at that instant at Cassidony, and how he deliuered her.
               
               
                  THe faire Eglartine Quéene of Tormaday being beseidged within the Castell of Castelford, by that traiterous companion Subbion: who fought by all possible meanes to surprize her, thereby to inuest himselfe, with the diadem of Tormaday in the absence of Blanchardin, shee perceiuing the traiterous crue to augment, and her friends to decrease, bewayling her hard aduenture to the olde Earle, and the good Prouost.

               The trustie Prouost séeing the distresse of his Quéene, and how desirous she was to be rescued by Blanchardine, (althongh she would not seeme to request or commauud him that seruice) yet he remembring her bountie and Blanchardines kindnes,

               Madam quoth the Prouest, I thinke the seruices most honorable and gracious, wherein I shall aduenture my life, at your commaund and in your affaires, neither will I be partiall in performing them, although my body should susteine

               The viligent Prouost, princly issuing out of the Castle, prepared a prettie Barke, which when he had furnished accordingly, he with a sew, betooke himselfe to Sea And ere many, daies, reached, the shore of Cassidony, where he found diuers mightie shipes to lye in readnesse for the transporting of Blanchardine, and after he had perfectly learned, the estate of the countrie the installation of Sadony, & the ouerthrow of Alimodes, he staied not, vntill he entered the Citie, where he was most royallie receiued of many, but espetialy of Blanchardine, who graced him with many welcomes. And when he had most amply recommende his▪ Quéene and mistres faire Eglantine to Sadony, and his 
                     〈◊〉
                   Quéene, ho taking Blanchardine by the hand into a more secret place, began thus. The sorrowfull

newes, (noble prince) which I haue to relate vnto you, doth almost daunt my heart before I begin to speake: know Sir for troth, that the traytor Subbion, whome at your departure, you aduaunced vnworthily to the protection of the Quéene & kingdome, of Tormaday, hath conuerted your people from alleigeances, ransackte your treasures, and put your Quéene to flight, into the strong Castell of Castelford, where the good old Earle, doth with all royaltie and reuerence, entarteine and protect her from the said Subbion, who intendeth (if possiblie hee may) to marrie her and enioy the Kingdome in her right: but your loyall Quéene, disdaining both the traytor, and his ambitious pride, whome she knoweth to be baselie borne, holdeth him and his adherents, as disloyall to her Crowne and dignity, and vpon your returne, purposeth to inflict such condinge punishment vpon them, as their rebellious presumptions deserueth: hasten therefore mightie Prince, to deliuer her from their outrages, whose body, life and loue, is wholy deuoted to thée: and without spéedy remedy, verie likelie to be by force seperated from thée.
               When Blanchardine had heard the end of his short tale, (it was not néedfull to bid him hast, for presently he certified Sadony and the Quéene of his vils consperacie, requesting aide from them, to relieue his faire Eglantine; Sadony more regarding the comforte of Blanchardine, then his croune and dignitie, promised nst only to aide him with men and munition, but also to accompanie him in person to Tormaday and venture his life, in his fréendly quarrell. But when faire Beautrix perceiued, that Sadony meant to departe, she began pitifully to complaine herselfe, but séeing the necessitie of the cause, which compelled him, in regarde of the many fauours he had found in Blanchardine, shee condiscended thereunto: So in hast they entred their Shipps (Eolus and Neptune graunting spéedy passage) and in verie little time they arriued before Tormaday: as soone as they were come a shore, Blanchardine dispatched the Prouost to the Citie, to sound the Citizens, whether they would render the same and submitte to Blanchardine or no, whether being come, and hauing

performed his charge, the most & greatest part consented to Blanchardine, But a small rabble of rascals, which were garisond in the behalf of Subbion, withstood the rest, whereupon the greater number assembling together, got the market place, where they set vpon the rebels, & in small time were masters of the Toune: the dead carcasses of the traytors which they found, they threwe ouer the walls into the ditches of the Citie: and foorthwith opening the gates, in great humilitie they submitted the Citie and themselnes to Blanchardine. No sooner was he entred the Citie▪ but he sēt a trustie spy, to steale (if it were possible) within the Castell, where the Quéene Eglantine laie, who by his carefull industrie, entered there vnséene, and recounted vnto the Queene the successe which Blanchardine alreaddie had, being lately come ashore.
               This vnexpected newes recomforted the Quéene and the old Earle of Castelford: and presently they made great myrth and ioy within the Castel▪ so yt the noyes came to the ears of Subbion, who greatlie wondering at this sudden applause, vtterlie ignorant what had happned within the Citie, he began to doubt.
               But Blanchardine and the Prince Sadony sith spéedie pace, hauing deuided their companies into sundrie battels, marched by priuie and obscure waies, till they came néere vnto the Castell: but by chaunce a certaine fréebooter of Subbions companie, hauing forraged abroad for fresh vittailes, espied their secret march, and presently related it to Subbion, at which newes his colour became pale for feare, yet séeing no remedie, he encourraged his followers to shew their vallors, promising mountaines (if victorie chaunced on his part) & threatning them with feare of death for their treacheries, (if Blanchardine were victor)
               Now begāthe two armies to ioine, where on the one part fear, on the other hope, was the ensigne. But by ye valor of Blanchardine and Sadony, the fight endured not long, for they so assayled them on euery side, that both the traitors strengths and wittes, were quite confounded. And at this very instant, the olde Earle of Castelford, the knight of the ferry, and the trustie Prouost, made their issue out of the Castell: So that Subbion séeing no

way for his escape, betooke himselfe to flight, whom Blanchardine and Sadony pursued so fast, as their horses would giue leaue. But Subbion being mounted vpon a most stronge and swift courser (hauing got the start, lost them in the woodes. And in his flight he was encompast with twelue théeues, which did continually kéepe their recidence in those groues, liuing only vpon the rapines, pillages, thestes, and murthers of passengers vnto whom Subbion related at large his misfortune. And withall gaue them to vnderstand, that only two braue Gentlemen, posted in pursute of him, whome (if they could surprize) being thirteene to two which was excéeding oddes, he assured them, that they should obtaine the richest booty, that euer yet any had acquired. These murdering villaines, encoraged by his perswasions and desire of gaine, lay preuily in ambush for Blanchardine and Sadony. And 
                     •…
                  re long they chaunced to espie them, wandring in vnknowne pathes, vnto whome with gentle countenance, Blanchardine giuing a kind salutation, enquired if they had not séene a man passe this way very lately armed. These outlawes mildely replyed, that

And that there was no place of lodging within the space and compasse of six or seuen miles, and also a dangerous passage through the forrest in the darke, that if it pleased them to a light, and to refresh themselues with such accates as their simple cottage did afford, they should finde gentle entertainment. The two princes suspecting no guyle, were easily entreated to allight, and to accept this freendly proffer, (as they thought but being entered within this caue, Blanchardine perceiued presently, that the place and people were daungerous; and councelled S

but Subbion fainting with dastard feare, assured them that their forces were small and not able to make resistaunce by reason of the long and wearie fight, which they had endured all the day before, by whose perswasions, Siluanus and his assosiates, were resolutely bent to performe their deuised stratagem. About the twelfth hour̄e of the night, these accursed Caitiues began to set vpon these two noble Princes. But they so manfully behaued themselues, that not only Subbion was made a lyer, but also the whole company Liuelesse (except Subbion) whome they reserued to suffer condinge punishement for his offence, which was so no torious & full of treachery, that neither in their opinions nor in the iudgement of any, he deserued fauor, but the extreamest torture that either man could immagine or the law impose. So was this Traitor Subbion brought betwéen these two noble Princes to the Castell of Castelford: where he remained safe till other broiles were quieted and the rage of the people appeased. Then was he brought foorth in open sight of all to receiue his demerites by death, the which all in generall did both by their speaches and showtes, applaude and ratifie as héereafter shall be showen.
            
            
               
               Chap. 13.
               
                  The last Chapter conteyneth, how the Prince Blanchardine and Queene Eglantine were wedded and crowned The execution of Subbion, the death of the aged King of Frize and the returne of Sadony to Cassidonie to his faire Beautrix.
                  
               
               
                  AFTER the battell before the Castell was finished, and that Subbion with his accomplices were put to flight, the Quéene of Tormaday (surnamed the proud Ladie in loue) with the old Countesse of Castelford, dissending doune the staiers, thinking to welcome her Lord Blanchardine, and the Prince Sadony, they found the old Eare of Castelford, which (euen then) was come to the Eastell with many prisoners and rich booties of the rebels, she demaunded where Blanchardine and Sadony were? Madam answered the old Earle, it is not long since they were both héere in our companie and we supposed that they had bene alreadie entered the Castell before our comming. When the faire Queene perceiued, that no tidings could be heard of them, fearing some mischaunce, she fell into a sounde wherein she continued the space of an houre and more, but being recouered, she began most pitteously to wéepe and exclaime against fortune: the old Earle and the Countesse recomforted her as well as they could, but nothing could sort to her content: then they laid her on a sumptious bed, hoping by sléepe to make her forget sorrowe, but neither sléepe nor quiet could harber in her head, fearing least Blanchardine were slaine: now Blanchardine and Sadony, hauing slaine the murtherers and

                  es fast to the back of an other horse which they found there: and by the light of the Moone, tooke their way to Castelford, which was distance thence foure miles: Sadony leading the way, Subbion in the middest, and Blanchardine the hindmost, They posted so fast, that within short time they came before the gate of the Castell, where they allighted from their horses: then knocking at the gates, they were presently knowne, and with all spéed let in, leading Subbion betwéene them: the newes being brought to ye Quéene, her melancholy was turned to mirth, her sorrow to sollace, and her wéeping to laughter: Blanchardine commaunded that Subbion should be imprisoned in the most obscure dungion within the Castell, and that himselfe would become his Iaylor. After which he assended vp into the Queenes chamber, whom he found new risen, raised by this happy news, at whose entrance, her spirits began to be recomforted: and after many kisses, and swéet imbracements, they sate downe, and spent the night in discoursing of their aduentures past.
               But when the day began to péepe, they tooke their horses and rode to Tormaday, against whome (in all kind manner) came the aged king of

                     •…
                  ewed with rushes, and sweet smelling roses, to gratulate their comming: the matrons compiling garlands of sundry flowers, the Ladyes dauncing, the damsels singing, the musicke sounding a sweet concordance to their entrie. Thus in tryumph they assended the princely pallace, most sumpteously adorned with rich cloth of golde, embost with pearle and stone, where by the whole aduice and generall consent of all, they were affiaunced.
               The neighboring Princes which long had bent their deuotions to thee sweet Saint which kept her shrine in Tormaday (I meane the faire and chast Lady Eglantine surnamed the proude Lady in loue) hauing receiued notice by their espialls which kept continuall residence within the Citty of Tormaday, to certifie the newes which happened there, to their Princes and Counsels, hearing (I say) that this Queene, whose obstinacie against

Cupid was incomparable, and peeuish conceit in leue, most absurd, had nowe entred the chapter house of his mother Venus, being limed in the bush of Blanchardines beauty, whose large commendations and magnanimious corage was caryed by the swift winges of flying fame throughout many Realmes and prouinces, the like before was sildome or neuer heard. These kings (I say) whose fancies before that time had receiued the perfect impression of loue in the Angellike beautie of that Princely Quéene, whose amber lockes trust vp in golden trammels, was a sufficient addamant to draw all Iron hearts vnto her: now séeing all hope of her recouerie past, and their desires frustrate, with franke and fréendly consent, not only came to visit and veiw Blanchardine, but also brought such honorable presentes and Kingly Iuels to welcome him to Tormaday, and to congratulate the happie mariage betwéene him and the faire Princesse Eglantine, as their Countries and kingdomes did afford. Some presented him with stately coursers and Iennets of seruice, some with ships of huge and mightie burthen, some with Pearles and Iuels of inestimable valure. And to be short, euery one though at first his foe and vtter enemie, yet in fine veiwing his maiesticall and princely corage, became his true and faithful fréends, estéeming him worthy of greater honor then either their personages presents, or the obtaining of the beautifull Quéene of Tormaday, could afford.
               And on the next morning, the beautifull Quéene was royally led, to and from the Church (where she was espoused to Blanchardine) by two Kings, Sadony and the king of Frize: and the same day crowned King and Quéene of Tormaday to the excéeding comfort of all their subiectes and friendes. After their returne from the Church to the Court, they were feasted withall possible chéere, that could bee deuised: and after dinner, the Trumpets sounded to the Iustes and tiltings vntill supper: And after supper maskes, playes, and Princely deuises, spent the time till they went to bed.
               On the morrow the feast began a fresh, and continued for the space of twentie daies. After all which arroyalties were finyshed,

by the commandement of Blanchardine, was Subyon and all his accomplices brought to execution: now the newes being caried with the swift wings of fame into Frizeland, the Lords of Frize repaired to Tormaday, to accompany home their aged King, and to congratulate this happy marriage of Blanchardine and his new Quéene.
               After the aged King of Frize Father to Blanchardine had séene the espousalls of this beautifull Quéene and his noble Sonne: being decrepit & stiffe with age, hauing liued to fourscore and vpward, vnto whome although his late enlargement from captiuitie, and this new come ioy of his déere sonne Blanchardine, being now married to the beautifull Quéene of Tormaday bred delight: Yet through debillitie of nature, which was sore inféebled by his hard imprisonment, he was surprised with an vncoth malladie and extreame contagion of dangerous sicknes, in the which he had not long remained, but in the view of all, life began to vade, and death approche. And more to hasten on deathes spéedy pace to this sencles olde man: the nobles of Frizeland hauing receiued sure and certaine inteligence from Tormaday of the life and fréedome of their King at that time there, and the princely mariage which now was fully concluded betwéene his successiue heire, their naturall leige Blanchardine with the renouned Lady and Quéene of Tormaday, they came thither: at whose approche, this fainting olde man hoping to receiue glad tidings from his aged wife the Quéene of Frize, began with chéerefull countenance to lift himselfe vp in his bed as though no kinde of deadly malladie or aged griefe had attainted his withered limbes. But whē he had a while listened to the swéet harmonie of their sugred speach which presaged no kind of disaster, but all pleasure and sollace that might be: at the length he demaunded of the welfare of the aged Queene his wife, vnto whome reply being made, that long time since vpon the vnfortunate report and tragicall tidings of his captiuitie by Darius sonne to the Pagan king Alimodes, shee fell sicke and died: hee listening to this impittious tale, fell as one distraught into a sound: But comming to himselfe powred forth these spéeches,

                  s silly aged King panting betweene life and death, lay still a while, till finding his heart ouer charged with an other passion, he prosecuted his first complaint. O sacred Ioue searcher of al secret thoughts, whose eternall dietie raigneth within the highest heauens who from my cradle hast destined me to perpetuall miserie, now shew thy selfe a righteous iudge, and reuenge my wrongs vppon the accursed broode of infidels, who so irreligiously prophane thy blessed name, & suffer them not to escape thy reuenging powre, but at thy pleasure consume and confound the workers of this my woe: and now dissolue my daies and weary life, & leade me through th' unknowne passages to my deere and sweetest wife, that though our daies on earth did finde small cō
                  fort, yet our soules in heauen may finde consolation. And with this orizon he yeilded himself to God and died. Whē the brute of this heauie tidinges came to the eares of Blanchardine and his faire Quéene, although they swinne before in the hauen of happines and floted on the floodes of al felicitie (as they thought) yet in that very instant and moment of time, a cloudie mist began to obscure their brightest sonshine, and a frost of cares to ouer runne their summers blisse.
               Now began Blanchardine to accuse and condemne himselfe, of vnnaturall ingratitude and disobedience to his parentes, to whome both nature and dutie bound him to bee submissiue and kind: now he beg

Leaue therefore (braue King to bewaile him whome you haue cause to ioy for, and comfort our pensiue Queene and your faire spouse whose torments cannot cease, séeing you so sad. As one newly risen from a traunce, or out of a heauy slumber, so Blanchardine hauing listened to this short and swéete discourse of his nobles, began to recall his sences home, which before were wandring after the Ghost of his father, through the Elizian féeldes, and

perceiuing sorrow to be both needlesse and bootlesse, so well as the time and this hard occasion would permit, he began to be more chéerefull, and so pacing toward the Quéene with a simpering smile, neither presaging mirth nor mourning, he began to recomfort her. How now faire loue? what, are your melancholies such, as nothing can make you merrie? swéete hart be pacified, and snake of these vntimelye passions, and learne by me to disgest the hard and harsh pilles of vnhappie fortune. The cause is mine, and if sorrow be expected in any, it is I that must be sorrowfull: but I haue found it both hurtfull to my body, and not auaileable to the dead: and therefore haue shaken it of as a thing of no regarde. Let vs not therefore (sweete wife) be the cause of a mournfull courte, but the authors of merry company, since it hath pleased God to sorte our haps to our harts contentments in our happy wedding. The Queene whose sadnes grew by reason of her husbands heauinesse, seeing him to haue so quickly dismissed his heauy passions, became presentlye iecond & merry, & so betweene them cōmaunded great preparation to be forthwith made, to performe the obsequeis of the deceased King of Freeze his Father: which shortly with all solemnitie fitting his estate, was accomplished, to the great admiration of all the beholders, for the sumptuous magnificencie and surpassing pompe wherwith he was interred: all costly odors and sweet senting spices were bountifully bestowed vpon him, great almes and charity were dealt and distributed, and innumerable sollemne processions & praiers, were made for him in honor of his person dead, and loue of his Sonne liuing.
               Now Sadonie who was not only a beholder, but a principall actor in all this heauy tragedie: after these obsequies were solemnized, and that the estate of his sworne freend Blanchardine and his faire Quéene rested in perfect quiet, voyde and frée both offortaine and domesticall enimies, bethinking himselfe of his beautifull Beautrix his trusty Regent of Cassidony (hee I say) whome loue had stonge to the quicke by his late marriage, comming to Blanchardine began thus. Since Noble fréend and true copartner of all mishaps, that fortune hath spit her deadly spight

and that now there remaineth no more seruice for me to doe in defence of your royall person, your Realme and Quéene: and that my princely Quéene languisheth at home, by reason of my long absence, whose princely person is the true Idea of my thought: let me craue fauor to depart vntill occasion, or your fréendly letters call me hether againe, where and when, I will not faile so long as life shall rest within me, to do you all possible fauor and kindnes. Blanchardine (imagining by himselfe) that the sting of loue was a sufficient pricke to call Sadony home, and that he should greatly iniury him & his faire Beautrix, in withholding them a sunder: not onely gaue his consent for his departure, but with all honor accompanied him to his ships, with his Princely Eglantine, where not without millions of teares and many kind imbracements they parted companie.
               Thus with pleasant gale and quiet tide, Neptune guiding the healme, sayled Sadony and his warlike companie towardes the Realme of Cassidony, where his princely Quéene the beautifull Beautrix held her Royall court, but heauy and mournfull for the absence of her Lorde and husband Sadony: for wrathfull Nemisis enuying of her good hap, and willing to heape greater

Then the skilfull Pilots whose wandring course was past their compasse, looking to the skyes, were directed a true passage by a christall starre so that within short time they reacht the shore of Cassidony, where the beautifull Beautrix

                   awaited their landing. When Sadony was now escaped the danger of the sea, and safely come a shore, after humble thankes to God, he seazing vpon the rofiall lips of his royall Quéene in whose countenance snow and blood made such a mixture, that in

the opinion of all, if nature should deuise to frame her paragon she might fayle in perfection. But after many kinde curtesies and amiable imbracentents betwéene Sadony and his Beautrix and the Lordes and Ladies, where euery one stroue with kindnes to welcome home her loue, they repaired to the court, where for that night, the King and his Quéene spent the time in content, and al the rest congratulated their happy meetings. On the morrow when glorious Phoebus began to cut the cloudes, and drewe the darknes from the earth, euery one prepared himselfe to be ready to attend the princes pleasure.
               After Sadony had royally presented himselfe to the veiw of all, giuing a princely boniure to the Lordes and nobles, be commaunded that the soldiers whose trauels had béene great, should repaire to his presence, to receiue a recompence for their paines, which bountie did so combine the trustie minds of all vnto him, that base was he accompted, that would refuse to hazard his life where and when it pleased Sadony to commaund. Then were the lawes which in his absence the Quéene and Counsell had deuised, presented to him to ratifie, which he we all princely magnificencie did forthwith establish, to the great admiration and singuler content of all his subiectes and people. Now tatling swift winged fame, the spéedy messenger of happie newes, ceased not vntill these tidinges were brought to the eares of the King of Spruse at the cittie Marienbourgh (then in his profound and deep meditations for his sonne Sadony) and his departed companion. But when he heard of the hard aduentures which his sonne had escaped by sea, his deliuerie from death on land, and his most happy marriage with the beautifull Beautrix, vanishing feare (whose cankering rust had almost consumed his pleasure) hee with all his nobles and people, offered burnt sacrifices to their Mahon for this happie tidings: Yet not content nor satisfied in minde▪ he rigged certaine ships wherein he and diuers of his Lordes embarqued themselues, longing to visite his son at Cassidomet and led by this sweete desire, after they had sayled the space of one wéeke, they came ashore within those territories: But when newes was brought to Sadony that certaine

Pagans were arriued, and craued to bee admitted his princely presence: Ignorant altogether what or whence they shoulde be: seating himselfe in his Royall throne, accompanied with his faire Queene and chiefe peeres, hee commaunded them to bee brought to his presence, vpon whose approche, Sadony knowing his father, by the maiestie of his countenaunce, desended from his seate, humbling himselfe on his knees at his fathers feete. The faire Beautrix vnwitting who he might be, to whome Sadony should shewe such reuerence, stood in a maze: But after she knew him to be father to Sadony, with a most gracious and amiable chéere came to entertaine him, to whome the King of Spruse rendred millions of thankes, both for the life and marriage of his sonne, without whose rescue hee had bin traiterously murdred, and hanged by Alimodes. But the faire Quéene answered, that both her life, liuing, and people rested in the safetie of Sadony, without whome (quoth shée) neyther may I, nor my kingdome continue: Now when the King of Spruse had listened to her zealous and sugred tale, fixing a stedfast countenaunce on her face, he seemed as one rauished in contemplation, admiring the beauty and bounty of the Queene. But Sadony, thinking his father (after his ariual from sea) to be desirous to repose himself, led him with all maiestie into a most princely lodging: where after his repast, he went to bed: the other Lords of his troope and all their followers were so honorably entertained there, that the commendation of Sadonies bountie, was bruted euery where. Now on the next morning when (according to custome) Sadony and his faire Quéene, repaired to the Church, to heare deuine seruice, the King of Spruse not suspecting that his Sonne Sadony had altered his religion from his Mahomet: after the Priestes had begun to sing a sollemne procession in the honor of Christ, he as a man distraught in sence, and ouercome with madding frenzy, ran vp and downe cursing and exclaiming against his sonne, so that neither perswasions, teares, vowes, nor praiers might once appease his franticke rage: till retiring himself all sollitary into his chamber, tormented with passions & agonies, at length he fell a sleep, to whome a little after entred diuers of the Lordes

which accompanied Sadonie from Marienbrough with Blanchardine, and perswaded the King that the idolatrous Mahomet was a false deceauer and of no diety, which by sundry and wonderfull miracles▪ they had founde Christ to be the true Messias and sonne of God: and therefore with all humilitie, ioyntly on their knées they entreated his maiestie, to leaue his superstitious worshipping of blockish Mahomet, and with all deuotion to acknowledged Christ to be the true God: And euen at that very instant the stony heart of this Pagan King was mollified, who forsaking his idolatrie, became a christian. This happie newes so delighted his sonne, that vnder heauen nothing could worke him more content: Then laboured Sadony and his faire Quéene with all royaltie, to welcome their father and his followers, where their entertainmēt was excéeding measure, both for magnificencie and cost: So past the time a moneth or more, of their abode in iollity, vntill the King desirous to returne to Marienbourgh, requested leaue of Sadony, for his departure: who séeing the tickle state of his fathers kingdome, in his absence, wanting a gouernour there, was the more willing, and so all possible prouision being made with princely bounty bestowed by Sadony and his Beautrix vpon the Lords of Spruse, they accompanied the King to his ships: And after humble dutie done by Sadony to his father and kinde curteste to the rest, he recommended them to the mercy of Blanchardines God.
