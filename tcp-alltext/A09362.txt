            How a man may know, whether he be the childe of God or no. Resolued by the vvord of God.

            To the godlie Reader.
            IN Gods Church commonlie they, who are touched by the Spirit, and begin to come on in religion, are much troubled with feare, that they are not Gods children, and none so much as they. Therefore, they often thinke on this point, and are not quiet till they find some resolution.
            The Spirit of God [as best knowing the estate of Gods children] hath penned two parcels of holie Scripture, for the full resoluing of this case: namelie, the 15. Psalme, and the first Epistle of S. Iohn.
            And for the helping of the simple and vnlearned, who desire to be informed, concerning their estate, I haue propounded these two partes of Scripture, in forme of a Dialogue: and haue joyned thereunto, a litle discourse, concerning the same matter: penned in Latine, by H. ZANCHIVS, a learned Diuine, and now englished.
            Vse this labour of mine for thy benefit and comfort: and the Lord increase the number of them which may rejoice, that their names are written in heauen.

                     MAnie among vs denie the God-head, & many the Manhood of Christ.
               
               
                  IOH.
                  1. That which was from the beginning (and therefore true God,) which wee haue hearde (namelie, speaking,) which wee haue seen with these our eies, which we haue looked vpon, and these hands of ours, haue handled of that Word (not the sounding, but the essentiall word of the Father,) of life. (liuing of himselfe, and giuing life to all other.)
               
               
                  CH.
                  Before you goe any further, this word of life is inuisible: how then could it be seene?
               
               
                  IOH.
                  (Yes) 2. For that life was made manifest, (to wit, in the flesh,) and we (I with many others) haue seen it, and beare witnesse, and publish vnto you, that eternall life, which was with the father (eternallie before this manifestation)

                     and was made manifest vnto vs.
                  
               
               
                  CH.
                  Menander, Ebion, and Cerinthus, hauing bin teachers among vs, confidently denie these thinges which you say: and they beare vs in hand, that they seek our good.
               
               
                  IOH.
                  3. That (which I wil repeat again, for more certainties sake) which wee haue seen and heard, declare we vnto you, that ye may haue fellowship with vs, and that our fellowship also may be with the father, and with his sonne Iesus Christ.
                  
                  4. And these things write we vnto you, that your ioy might be ful. (vz. might haue sound consolation in your consciences.)
               
               
                  CH.
                  Wel then, lay vs down som groūd, wherby we may come to be assured, that we haue fellowship one with an other, and with Christ.
               
               
                  IO.
                  5. This then is the message which we haue heard of him, and declare vnto you, that God is light (vz. purenes it selfe, and blessednesse; whereas men and Angels are neither, but by participation) and in him is no darknes.
                  
               
               
                  CH.
                  Som that make profession among vs, continue stil in their olde course and conuersation; and yet they say, they haue fellowship with God.
               
               
                  IOH.
                  
                     Profession without practise, a note of an hypocrite.6. If we say that we haue fellowship with him, and walk (lead the course of our liues)

                     in darknes (vz. ignorance, error, impietie,) wee lie (dissemble) and do not trulie. (deal not sincerely.)
               
               
                  CH.
                  What then is the true marke of one, which hath fellowship with God?
               
               
                  IO.
                  7. If we walk in the light (lead the cours of our liues in sinceritie of life & doctrin) wee haue fellowship one with another.
                     Sincerity of life and religion, a note of communion with God.
                  
               
               
                  CH.
                  We are so defiled with sinne, that we often doubt, least wee haue no fellowship with God.
               
               
                  IOH.
                  
                     The bloud of Iesus Christ his sonne, cleanseth vs from all sinne.
                  
               
               
                  CH.
                  Some among vs are come to that passe, that they say, they haue no sinne: & that this estate is a signe of fellowshippe with God.
               
               
                  IOH.
                  8. If vve say that vve haue no sinne,
                     To professe perfect sanctification in this life, a note of an hypocrite. 
                     vve deceiue our selues, (imagining that to bee true which is otherwise) & truth is not in vs
                  
               
               
                  CH.
                  How then may we know that our sinnes are washed away by Christ?
               
               
                  IOH.
                  9. If vve confesse our sinnes (namely,humble confession of sin to God▪ is a note of remission of sinne. with an humbled heart, desiring pardon) he is faithfull & iust (in keping his promise) to forgiue vs our sinnes, and to clense vs from al vnrighteousnes.
                  
                  10. If vve say (as they before named do) vve haue not sinned, vve mak him a liar (whose word speaks the contrarie,) and his vvorde

is not in vs. (his doctrine hath noe place in our heartes.

                  CH.
                  IF this be true which hath bin saide, that the bloud of Christ doth clēse from all sinne: and that if we do confesse them, they shal be pardoned; our corruption tels vs, that we may sinne freely.
               
               
                  Ioh.
                  1. My litle children, these thinges I write vnto you, that yee sinne not.
                  
               
               
                  CH.
                  Alas, we fall oft by infirmitie: what shall we then do?
               
               
                  Ioh.
                  
                     If any man sinne, vve haue an aduocate (who in his own name, and by his own merites, pleades our cause) to the Father, Iesus Christ the iust (and therefore fit to make intercession)
               
               
                  CH.
                  But howe may euery one of vs in particular, knowe that Christ is his aduocate?
               
               
                  IOH.
                  2. He is the propitiation (vz. a couering of sinne, or reconciliation, as the propitiatorie of the Arke couered the lawe) and not for our sinnes onely, but also, for the sins of the vvhole vvorld (not onely Iewes, but also Gentiles of all sortes.)
               
               
                  CH.
                  Be it that I knowe him to be my aduocate: may I not be deceaued? howe may I knowe, that this my knowledge is

effectuall to saluation?
               
               
                  IOH.
                  3. Hereby are vve sure that vve know him (here, that knowledg is ment,An endeuo

                  Ch.
                  Many among vs, professe that they know Christ; but their liues be not according.
               
               
                  Ioh.
                  4. He that saith, I know him, & keeps not his commandements, is a lyer,
                     Faith without obedience, a note of an Hypocrite. 
                     and the trueth is not in him.
                  
               
               
                  CH.
                  How may it be prooued, that the endeuour to keep gods commandements is a mark of faith, & felloship with Christ?
               
               
                  Ioh.
                  (He in whome the loue of God is perfecte, may hereby know, that hee is in Christ.) 5. But he that keepeth his vvord, in him is the loue of God: (vz. not that loue wherewith God loueth him; but that, whereby he loueth God) is perfect indeede: (vz. sincere and sounde perfection, being opposed, not to imperfection, but to hypocrisie:) hereby (therefore) we know that we are in him. 6. He that saith he remaineth in him, ought to walke euen so, as hee hath walked: (and therefore he must needes endeuour

himselfe in the commandementes.
               
               
                  CH.
                  Declare vnto vs some of the principall of these commandements?
               
               
                  IOH.
                  7. Brethren, I vvrite no nevv commandement vnto you, but an olde commaundement vvhich yee haue heard from the beginning: this old commandement is the vvord, vvhich ye haue heard from the beginning. 8. Againe, a nevve commandement I vvrite vnto you, that vvhich is true (to wit, that the commandement is new which he wil now write) in him (who reneweth the cōmandement of old giuen to Moses) & also in you, for the darknes is past. (vz. the hardening of the minds of men, vnder the olde testament, whereby they did but in a small measure vnderstand the word) and that true light (a greater mesure of illuminatiō; as also the writing of Gods lawes, not in Tables of stone, but in the fleshie hearts, so as they be transformed into the obedience thereof) now shineth.
                  
               
               
                  CH.
                  Well: set downe this commandement which is so ancient, and is nowe renewed.
               
               
                  Ioh.
                  
                     profession ioyned with hatred and malice, a note of an hypocrite9. He that saith (as many among you do) that he is in the light (that is, that hee is both plentifully inlightened and borne anew) and hates his brother, is in darknes (vnder the estate of damnation, not yet trulie regenerate) vntill this time. 10. Hee that

loueth his brother,
                     Loue of our brother, a signe of regeneration. 
                     abideth in the light (is trulie enlightened and regenerate.) and there is no offence, (vz. he wil giue no occasion of euill) in him. 11. But (on the contrary) hee that hateth his brother, is in darknes, and walketh in darknesse, (leadeth his life in ignorance and vngodlinesse) and knoweth not whither he goeth; because that darknesse hath blinded his eies.
                  
               
               
                  Ch.
                  What moueth you to deliuer vnto vs, al these notes and signs of our new birth and communion with Christ.
               
               
                  Ioh.
                  12. Litle Children, I write vnto you, because your sinnes are forgiuen you▪ for his namesake (vz. by Christ and his merites; that yee may be certified to your comforte of this.)
                  (And that no kind of men among you might doubt of this) 13. I write vnto you fathers, because ye (delighting to tell & hear of olde and ancient matters) haue knowne him (that is, christ) that is from the beginning. I write vnto you young men, because ye (delighting to shewe your valour and strength) haue ouercome the euil one. (that is, Sathan.) 14. I write vnto you litle childrē, (who delight alwaies to bee vnder the Fathers wing,) because yee haue knowen the Father. (And againe, because wee are dull to marke and remember that which is good for vs.) I

haue vvritten vnto you Fathers, because yee haue knowen him that is from the beginning: I haue vvritten vnto you young men, because yee are strong, and the vvorde of God abideth in you: and yee haue ouercome that wicked one
                  
               
               
                  CH.
                  If we be in the estate of grace vnder Gods fauour in Christ; howe may wee abide in it?
               
               
                  IOH.
                  15. Loue not this vvorld (the corrupt estate of mankinde out of Christ,) neither the thinges that are in the vvorlde (for first of all, to giue reasons,) if any man loue this Worlde, the loue of the father (wherewith hee loued the Father) is not in him. (Secondly,) 16. For all that is in this vvorlde, as the lust of the flesh (the corruption of nature, which chiefly breaketh out in euil concupiscence) the lust of the eies (the fruite of the former, stirred vp by outward prouocations, especially in the eie, as it is manifest in Adulterie & couetousnes) and the pride of life (vz. Arrogancie and Ambition, among men, in common conuersation of life,) is not of the father, but of the vvorlde. 17. And (Thirdly) this vvorld passeth away and the lust thereof: but he that fulfilleth the wil of God, abideth for euer.
                  
               
               
                  Ch.
                  What other thinges are we to do, that we may continue?
               
               
                  IOH.
                  18. Little Children, it is the last time:

and as yee haue hearde, that Antichrist shall come, (a speciall Antichrist, the chiefe of all other; who is nowe manifest to be the Pope of Rome) euen now, ar there many Antichristes, (Heretickes, denying, either the natures of Christ, or his offices: or the vnion and distinction of his Natures:) vvhereby vvee knowe, that it is the last time:
                  
               
               
                  CH.
                  Those whome you cal Antichrists, were of our companie; and professed as we do.
               
               
                  Ioh.
                  19. They vvent out from vs, but they vvere not of vs: for if they had bene of vs, they should haue continued vvith vs. But (this commeth to passe, that it might appear, that they are not al of vs.
                  
               
               
                  CH.
                  How can we be assured of our continuance in grace; for wee may fall as well as they do?
               
               
                  IOH.
                  20. But yee haue an annointment,
                     Gods spirite dwelling in the heart, a signe of perseuerance. (the grace of Gods holy spirit, resembled by the annoynting in the old testament) from that holy one (Christ, Luke. 1.15.) and knowe all thinges.
                  
               
               
                  CH.
                  If wee knowe all thinges, then you need not write vnto vs of these matters.
               
               
                  Ioh.
                  21 I haue not written vnto you, because ye know not the trueth, but because you know it, & that no lie is of the truth (vz. ye can distinguish

betweene the sound doctrine of the Gospel, and errors)
               
               
                  Ch.
                  What is this lie which you speak of?
               
               
                  Ioh.
                  
                     papists deny Iesus to bee Christ, for though in words they magnifie him, yet in their doctrin by necessary consequent, they denie him to be a king, a priest a prophet.22. Who is a lier (a deceauer, a seducer) but hee that denieth that Iesus is Christ? (the Messias or Sauiour of mankind.) The same is the Antichrist, that denieth the father and the sonne.

                  These whom you meane (say they) defend the doctrine of God as well as we; and they vse to call him their father.

                  23. Who so denieth the son, hath not the Father.

                  24. Let therfore abide in you, the same (doctrine concerning Christ) which ye haue hard from the beginning (which the Apostles preached;perseuerance in the knowledge and obedience of the Gospell, a sign of communion with Christ. and before them the Prophets, since the beginning of the world) If that which ye haue heard from the beginning, remain (ye beleeuing and obeying it) in you, yee also shal continue in the sonne, and in the father. 25. And this, is the promise which hee hath promised vs, euen life eternall.

                  Wee cannot perswade our selues of perseuerance, seeing men so commonly fall away from Christ among vs.
               
               
                  Ioh.
                  26. These thinges haue I vvritten vnto you, concerning them that deceaue you (not

meaning them of you, as you seem to tak it) 27. But the annointing (the spirite which yee haue receaued of Christ, and which hath led you into all trueth) vvhich ye haue receiued of him, dvvelleth in you, (abideth in you, and will so continewe) and yee neede not that any man teach you, (any other doctrine beside this, which ye haue learned already:) but as the same annointing, teacheth you all thinges, and it is true and not lying, and as it taught you, ye shall abide in him. 28. And now, litle Children, abide in him, that vvhen he shall appeare, vve (being iustified in Christ,) may haue boldnes, and not be ashamed: (neither Sathan, nor our consciences accusing vs for sinne,) before him at his comming.

                  Wee are still in doubt to returne back to that which you say before, howe an endeuour to keepe the commaundementes, should be a signe of fellowshippe with Christ.

                  29. If ye knovv that he (God) is righteous, knovv ye, that he vvhich vvorketh righteousnes, is borne of him. (as a Child is knowen to haue such a man for his Father, becaus he resembleth him.

Whosoeuer committeth sinne, (practiseth sinne with full consent of wil; not endeuouring himselfe in holines of life,) transgresseth also the lavve (and for that cause, being vnder the curse of the Lawe, cannot be Gods children) for sinne is the transgression of the lavve. (Vnderstand, by lawe, not morall lawe, but any commaundement of God, whether it be in the law or Gospell. 5. And (againe,) yee knovv, that hee vvas made manifest, (took our nature on him) that he might take avvay our sinnes, (the guilt & punishment at once, and the corruption by litle and litle,) and in him is no sinne.
                  
                  (Thirdly,) 6. Whosoeuer abideth in him, sinneth not: (he doeth not giue himself to sin, so as it should raigne in him:) Whosoeuer sinneth, hath not seene him, nor knovvn him: (to wit, effectuallie, so as he can apply Christ and his benefites to himselfe.)

                  7. Litle Children, let no man deceiue you; he that vvorketh righteousnes, is righteous as he is righteous. 8. He that cōmitteth sin (thogh he say, he doeth beleeue, & therefore thinks himself justified before God) is of the deuil, (resēbleth the deuil, as the child doth the

father, and is gouerned by his spirite:) for the deuil sinneth from the beginning: (of the worlde:) (which appeareth, that) for this purpose vvas made manifest the son of God, that he might dissolue the works (for the beginning and continuance of all rebellion, and disobedience to God,) of the Deuil. (And further, to displaie these Seducers) 9. Whosoeuer is born of God, sinneth not, (vz. doth not keepe a course in sinne, howsoeuer hee fall by infirmitie) for his seed (vz. Gods word, cast into the hart, by the operation of the Spirite, making a man to spring vp into a new creature, (remaineth in him: neither can he sin, because he is borne of God.

                  Brieflie, to come to the point, how may it be known, who is Gods childe, and who is to be reputed the child of the deuil
               
               
                  IOH.
                  10. In this are the children of God knowne,
                     Loosnes of life, or the practise of sin, a note of the child of the deuill, for the present time. 
                     and the children of the deuill: vvhosoeuer vvorketh not righteousnes, is not of God, neither (to giue you a plaine example) hee that loueth not his brother. 11. For, this is the message, vvhich ye haue heard from the beginning, that vve should loue one another. 12. Not as Cain: he vvas of that euill one (Sathan) and slew his brother: and vvherefore slew he him? because his owne vvorkes vvere euil, and his brothers good.

                  Yet if we loue those which be our

brethren, according to the fleshe neuer so much; they cease not to hate and persecute vs.
               
               
                  Ioh.

                  If not to loue, be a note of the Childe of the Deuill, what is the note of Gods child?
               
               
                  Ioh.
                  14. We know that vvee are translated from death to life, because vve loue the brethrē,
                     To loue a christian, because he is a christian, or godly man, is a note of Gods chiid. (vz. such as be Christians, because they ar Christians:) (as on the contrary,) hee that loueth not his brother, abideth in death: (is vnder the estate of damnation.) 15. Whosoeuer hateth his brother, is a manslayer: and yee knowe that no manslayer hath eternall life abiding in him.

                  16. Hereby vvee haue perceiued loue, that he layed downe his life for vs: therefore vve ought (carried with the like affection of loue) to lay downe our liues for the brethren.

                  Manie in speech do pretend loue, but we find not this willing affection and readines to shew loue.
               
               
                  Ioh.
                  17. Whosoeuer hath this worldes good, (wherewith this life is sustained) and seeth

his brother haue neede,
                     Compassion stirring in the heart, a note of loue 
                     and shutteth vp his bowels (vz. hath no cōpassion, because it sheweth it selfe by the rowlling of the intrals) from him, how dwelleth the loue of God in him?

                  18. My litle Children, let vs not loue in vvord, nor in tongue onely, but in deede and in trueth (sincerely.) 1.19. For thereby we knowe that vve are of the trueth (sound professors of the Gospell of Christ,Workes of mercy, signs of loue.) 2. and shall before him appease our hearts:sincere loue a note of sincere profession. (in regard of any accusation that our conscience shal lay vnto vs, before Gods iudgment seate) 20. If our heart condemne vs (an euill conscience accuse vs,) God is greater then our heart (namely in iudging of vs,) & knoweth all thinges.

                  IOH.
                  21. Beloued, if our heart condemne vs not,
                     Boldnes in praier, a signe of a pacified conscience. 
                     then haue we boldnes towards God. (vz. to to come vnto him by prayer.)

                  Ioh.
                  1. Dearely beloued, beleeue not euery spirit (vz. doctrines, which men bragging of the spirit do teach;) but try the spirits vvhether they be of God, for many false prophets are gone out into the vvorld.

                  2. Hereby shall vve knowe the spirite of God, euery spirit (doctrin) vvhich confesseth that Iesus Christ (the Messias) is come in the flesh (is made true man; this being the substance

of the Gospell,) is of God. 3. And euery spirit that confesseth not, that Iesus Christ is come in the flesh, is not of God: but this is the spirit of Antichrist, of vvhom ye haue hard, how that he shal come, & now alredy is in the world.

Christ, their redemer, the holy ghost their sanctifier.) 8. He that loueth not, knoweth not God, for God is loue (vz. whollie bent to shew his loue and compassion to his people.) (For a proofe of this,) 9. Herein was that loue of God made manifest among vs, because God sent that his only begottē son into the world, that we might liue through him. 10. Herein is that loue, not that we loued God; but that he loued vs: & sent his sonne to be a reconciliation for our sinnes.

No man hath seene God at any time: (neuerthelesse,) if vve loue one another (this is a signe) that God dwelleth in vs, and his loue is perfect in vs: (vz. that loue wherewith he loueth, is throughlie made manifest towards vs by our loue: as the light of the Moone shining on vs, argueth the light of the sun shining vpō the moon, of whom (as frō a fountain) the moone takes her light.

                     A sincere confession of the Gospel, a note of communion with Christ. 15. Whosoeuer confesseth (in faith and loue) that Iesus is the sonne of God, in him dwelleth God, and he in God.

                     To be like God in holines of life, a signe of his loue to vs particularlie.17. Hereby is that loue perfect, (vz. fully made manifest in vs,) that vvee may haue boldnes (to stand before him without fear) in the day of iudgement, for euen as he is, so are vve in the vvorld. (not in equalitie, but in conformitie of holines.) (As may appeare by the contrary) 18. there is no feare in loue (vz. when a man is assured of Gods loue to him, hee doeth not distrust, nor seruile feare him, in respect of his sinnes,) but perfect loue casteth out feare: for feare hath painfulnesse (checkings and torments of conscience:) and hee that feareth is not perfecte in loue.

                  19. We loue him, because he loued vs first,
                     Our loue of God, a signe that he loueth vs particularlie. (As when a man warmes him, the heate of his body is because the fire is first hote.)

               1. WHosoeuer beleeueth that Iesus is that Christ (true Messias) is born of god, & euery one that loueth him which did beget (vz. God the Father,) loueth him also, vvhich is begotten of him. (the Child of God, a true Christian.)
               
                  Ch.
                  This being manifest, that they ar hypocrits which say they loue God, yet shew no loue to their brethren, teach vs howe wee may knowe that wee loue our brethren?
               
               
                  Ioh.
                  2. In this we know that we loue the children of God,
                     An indeuor to keep the commandements, a sign of loue of our brother. 
                     when wee loue God and keepe his commandements (that is, indeuour to keep;

the beginning of the action, being put for the whole.) 3. For this is the loue of God (the duty of loue to God) that we keepe his commandements.

                     His commandements are not burdenous (to them that are in Christ; and are freed from the curse of the lawe, which makes the law grieuous, and are also guided by his holy spirit.) (And this is apparant) 4. for al that is borne of God, ouercommeth the vvorld (Sathan with all corruptions and workes of darknes.)

                  Ioh.
                  
                     And this is the victorie vvhich hath ouercome the vvorld, euen our faith (which is the instrument and hand, whereby we lay hold on him, that he in vs, and so wee by him, might ouercome the world.) 5. Who is this that ouercommeth this vvorlde, but hee vvhich beleeueth that Iesus is that Son of God?
                  
               
               
                  Ch.
                  How may we be resolued that Iesus of Nazaret, the sonne of Marie, was the sonne of God, and the Messias: hee came but basely into the world?
               
               
                  Ioh.
                  
                     Proofes invinsible, that Iesus of Nazaret, the son of Mary was the son of God, against the Iewes.6. This is that Iesus Christ, vvhich came by vvater (sanctification signified by the legall washings) and blood (imputation of Christs righteousnes or the sprinkling of his blood:) not by water only, but by water

and blood: (becaus Christ worketh both iustification, & sanctification together) & it is that spirit (a mans owne conscience inwardly purified) that beareth witnes, for that spirit is trueth: (that is, that the testimonie of the spirit of adoption, certifying vs, that we ar the sons of God is true.) 7. For, (that I may speak it more plainly,) there ar three vvhich beare record in heauen, the father, the vvord, (the Son) and the holy Ghost; and these three are one, (namly in testimonie.) 8. And there are three which beare record in earth, the Spirit, and the vvater, and blood: and these three agree in one.

                  How shew you that these witnesses be autenticall, and to be beleeued?
               
               
                  Ioh.
                  9. If vve receiue the vvitnes of men, the witnes of God is greater: for this is the witnes of God. (vz. that was said to come from heuen,) vvhich he testified of his son. (Again) 10. he that beleeueth in that sonne of God, hath the vvitnes in himselfe (the peace of conscience, which he may feel in himself:) (And further,) he that beleueth not God, maketh him a lyer: because he beleeued not the recorde, that God vvitnessed of his sonne.

                  Ioh.
                  11. And this is that record, to wit, that God hath giuen vnto vs eternall life, & this life

is in his son. 12. He which hath the son, hath life & he which hath not the son of god, hath not life. (And to conclude,) 13. These things haue I written vnto you that beleeue in the name of the son of God, that ye may know, that yee haue life eternal, & that ye may beleeue (vz. increase in faith,) in the name of that sonne of God.

                  How can we haue life eternal now, that are so miserable, and so ful of wants?
               
               
                  Ioh.
                  14. And this is that assurance that wee haue in him, that if we ask any thing according to his will, he heareth vs.

                  Ioh.
                  
                     A signe of our praiers granted vs, if God do but heare them.15. If vve know that he heareth (that is, (as it were) to giue an eare to our praiers,) vvhatsoeuer vve ask, we knowe that vvee haue the petitions, vvhich vvee haue desired of him, (though the things that we asked be not giuen vs in that measure, maner, and time, in which we asked them.)

                  16. If a man see his brother sin a sin, that is not vnto death; (that is, which may be pardoned,) let him ask (pardon in his behalfe) and he shal giue him life for them that sinne not vnto death: there is a sinne vnto death, (after which, necessarilie damnation followeth, as the sinne against the holy Ghost: I say

not that thou shouldest pray for it.

                  But is not euery sinne, a sinne to death?
               
               
                  Ioh.
                  17. All vnrighteousnes is sinne, (and therefore deserueth death:) but there is a sinne not vnto death; (namely that which is pardoned in Christ.)

                  Ioh.
                  18. Wee know that vvhosoeuer is borne of God sinneth not; but he that is begotten of god, kepeth himselfe, and that vvicked one (Sathan) toucheth him not. (vz. doth him no violēce, or he cannot giue him a deadly wound.) 19. We know that vve are of God, and this whol vvorld lyeth in euill: (that is in seruitude vnder Sathan and sinne.)

            A BRIEFE DISCOVRSE, TAKEN OVT OF THE VVRItinges of Hier. Zanchius. VVHEREIN THE FOREsaid case of Conscience is disputed and resolued.
            
               ASSERTION. I.
               
                  Onely the elect, and all of them: not onely trulie may bee, but also, are in that time vvhich God hath appointed them in this life, indeede assured of their Election to eternall life in Christ: and this is done not one vvay, but many vvaies.
               
               
                  WEe say, that the elect alone may be, and indeed are made sure of their Election: that so we may exclude the reprobat hipocrites: for considering they are not elected, they canne neuer be truelie perswaded, that they are elected. I say truely: because it may come to passe, that many in their own thinking shall be predestinate: yet in trueth they are not perswaded so: for they are deceaued. Wee haue an example in temporarie Christians, who thinke of themselues, that

they beleeue in Christ, but truelie do not beleeue: for their Faith is in hypocrisie: and for a time onely. Wherefore a true & certaine perswasion of Election, can neuer befall any of the reprobates: because the true perswasion of Heauenly matters,1. Cor. 2.10 Math. 11.27 commeth of the holy Ghost; which neuer perswadeth any false matter. Wherefore how can Reprobates bee perswaded that they are elected? This considered, it is not amisse, that wee attribute this perswasion (of which wee nowe speake) to the elect alone. We ad further, that al the elect, not onely may be, but are indeed made sure of their Election: Which must be demonstratiuelie confirmed against schoole-men, & other our aduersaries. We say, this is done in the time appointed; because the Elect, before they be called to Christ, are neuer sure of their election: nay, they neuer think of it, as appeareth in Paul before hee was called, and in others. Againe, in like maner after they haue bene called; yet not presently are made sure of their election: but some sooner, some latter. Lastly, we ad, that this is done many vvaies, what they ar (if not perfectly, yet in parte I will afterwarde shewe.) Nowe let vs come to the matter.
               The School-men demaunde, whether a

man may be made sure of his Election? And they determine that a man cannot, except it be by diuine reuelation: becaus Predestination is in God, and not in vs. And no man knoweth the thinges of God, but the spirit of God:1. Cor. 2.16. as no man knoweth the thinges of man, but the spirite of man, which is in him: Again, who knoweth the minde of the Lorde?Rom. 12.34. The elect by the testimonie of the holy Ghost, are made sure of their election. therefore (say they) some special reuelation is needeful: if any desire to be certified, either of his owne or of any other mans predestinatiō, their sayings are not simply to be disliked: but in that meaning, in which they vnderstād them, they are no way to be approoued. For they take a speciall reuelation to be this, if God shall signifie and say expresly to any, either by some Angell outwardly, or by his spirite inwardly, that he is predestinate to life: after which sorte, they hold that Paul, and a fewe other Saintes, had their predestination reuealed to thē, So they conclude, that, because euery man hath not his Election reuealed to him after this maner, that all men cannot be assured of their election. But they are deceued, for God, not onely by this one maner, which they spake off, doth reueale his will & his counsels, but by many: for God reuealeth thinges, either by the inwarde

inspiration of his spirit, or outwardly by his word: or both inwardly and outwardly, by inward and outward effectes. By his spirite, hee did inspire his Prophetes, and open many thinges to come. And Christ said to his Apostles, as concerning the holy Ghost: he shall lead you into all trueth. By his word, he spake vnto the Prophets, and in like maner,ch. 19.13 by his word hee teacheth vs his wil. Also, by diuers effectes, hee declareth, either his mercie or his iustice: as it is known. The same must be thought of the reuealing of his electiō: to wit, that God reuealeth the same to the elect, by the holy Ghost, by the worde, and by the most certaine effectes of predestination.
               The first testimonie, by which God assureth vs of our election, is the inward testimonie of the spirite, of which, the Apostle saith: the spirit (of God) testifieth vnto our spirits, that vve are the children of God. Nowe what is it to be the sonne of God, but first of al, to be predestinated to be the childe of God by adoption: & then to be made actuallie the sonne of God by faith: and lastly, by the same spirit also, to be regenerate as Gods Children are, and to put on the nature of the sonne of God, or rather the sonne of God himselfe, as the Apostle speaketh. Therefore the holy Ghost, whilest

he inwardly beareth recorde vnto our spirits, that is, to our minds, being enlightened by his light, that we are the sonnes of God: most plainly reuealeth that wee were predestinate from all aeternitie to adoption; for men are not made the sonnes of God by faith, nor regenerate to be the sonnes of God, nor put on Christ: except they be first of all predestinated to adoption. And there can be nothing more certain, then this testimonie: for who better knoweth the things of God, his counsels and decrees, then the spirit of God, which searcheth all thinges,1. Cor. 2.10▪
                   yea the deep things of God: therefore hee can most truly reueale vnto euery one of vs, the certaintie of our election. And he cannot deceiue vs in reueiling it: for he is the spirit of truth which can neither deceiue nor be deceaued.Ioh. 16.13. If an Angel from heauen shoulde be sent to thee, as he was sent to Marie, and as hee spake vnto the fathers, and should tell thee in the name of God, that thou wert elected to life euerlasting: wouldest not thou say, that thou couldest not then doubt any longer of thy election? But so much the more certaine is the testimonie of the spirite, which beareth record vnto our spirit, that we are the sonnes of God: by how much the holy Ghost doth more

knowe the thinges of God then any Angell: and can lesse deceiue then an Angel. And so much the more sure, is this testimonie, considering it is not keept in the bodily eares, where it might soone vanish away, but in our minde and spirit: becaus the spirit beareth record to our spirit. Ad further, that the holy Ghost neuer departeth from our spirit, but dwelleth in vs, abideth in vs, speaketh in vs, sheweth forth his power in vs, praieth in vs. Therefore the Apostle saith, that wee haue receiued the spirite of adoption,Rom. 8.15 Gal. 4.6. by which we crie Abba Father: as thogh he should say, this testimonie of the spirite is altogether so sure, by which, he beareth vs record, that we are the sonnes ef God, that presently without doubting, we can call vpon God, and cry Abba Father. And all the electe haue this testimonie, being made the sons of God by faith, and being renewed by the holy Ghost: and ingrafted into Christ; For so the Apostle speaketh,Rom. 8 9 if any man haue not the spirit of Christ, he is not his: therefore, whosoeuer is Christs, and is ingrafted into Christ, it is necessarie hee should haue the spirit of God. And whosoeuer haue receiued, and doe enioy the spirite of Christe; to their mindes the same spirit beareth record, that they are

the sonnes of God, and maketh them to cry Abba, Father. And it is certaine, that noe man is renewed by the holy Ghost, which is not perswaded, that God is his most mercifull and most louing Father: & therefore, can call vpon him as a Father. Therefore, although al men, in that they are assured by the certaintie of faith, that God is their Father, and they are his sons, do not thereby argue and conclude, that they are elected to eternal life: yet al men indeed, haue thereby a sure testimonie of their election to glorie: because, if they be the sonnes of God, they are also heires of eternall life. This testimonie I will briefly comprise within this demonstration: whosoeuer call vpon God, and in their hearts cry, Abba Father, they are the sonnes of God, and it is certain, that they thus crye by the spirit of God. And they which are the sonnes of God, are also heires of eternall life, and they haue bene predestinate to adoption: therefore it must needes be, that all they which are perswaded, that they ar the sons of god by the holy Ghost; are predestinate to eternall life, and must be perswaded of it. This is the first testimonie, and the first way, by which God reuealeth to euery elect man his predestination: namely, by the holy Ghost within

our heartes, bearing record vnto vs, that we are the sonnes of God, in christ and by Christ. And let this be the first argument, also seruing to confirme our assertion.
               
                  Vers. 2. The elect out of the word of god, their conscience making the assumption, at length they may be certainly perswaded of their predestination.The second way, by which God reuealeth to euery man his predestination, is by his word. I mean not any particular word, by which hee doeth declare to any, outwardlie, in priuate and speciall maner, and that in expresse wordes, his election: but the general word of the Gospel, by which Christ calleth all them, which beleeue in him, elect, both by himselfe, and by his Apostles, as in the new Testament, euerie where is most manifest. For, although in particular propositions he say not to thee, or to him particularlie, thou art elect to eternall life: yet, by means of generall propositions, he doeth aswell conclude in the heart of euerie one that beleeueth, that he is elected; as any man shall be able to conclude vnto particular men, that euery one of them is a liuing creature, indewed with reason, by this general proposition: Euerie man is a reasonable creature, indued vvith reason: the Assumption beeing suppressed. Therefore, after this maner dealeth God. He hath chosen all, and euerie seuerall man, whom he was to indew with Faith, to haue the euerlasting inheritance▪
               
               
                  Furthermore, he publisheth it to al the Elect, by the Apostles, in this general proposition, that all the faithful are elect to eternall life: the That, wherby a man applies the general promise to himselfe.assumption is concealed in the word of God. But when he giueth vs faith, he maketh euerie one of vs, to make an assumption by himselfe in his minde: but I am of the faithfull: for I finde in my selfe, that I trulie beleeue in Christ. Therefore, who is it that maketh this conclusion for thee, that thou art predestinat to euerlasting life? euen God himselfe: the proposition being taken forth of the gospell, & the assumption proceedeth of the gift of faith. But that indeed, by which we properlie attaine to the knowledge of the matter, conteined in the conclusion, is the midle tearme; as they call it. Wherefore, it is manifest, that God, by the worde of his Gospel, wher he saith, that al the faithfull ar elect: doth reueale to euerie faithfull man, his owne predestination. Onelie this one thing is to be required, that the faithfull man, hearing the vniuersall propositions, in his mind should make an assumption; But I am faithfull, by the gifte and grace of God. And is not God said to haue reuealed to euery man, his speciall malediction, in this generall proposition, Cursed is euerie one, that doth not continue in al things

that are vvritten in this book:
                  Deut. 27.26 althogh he say to no man specially, thou art accursed: for euery one doth mak this assūptiō, that he is accursed: because he knoweth most certēly, that he doth not cōtinue in al things that are written in the book of the Lawe. Therfore, the schoolmen ar deceiued, whē they say, it maybe, that euery man may be sure of his election: namelie, if God, which is able, will reueale it to him: yet, that hee doth onlie reueale it to a very few, as the Apostles: for God (as hath bene proued & declared) euen by his worde, in generall propositions, doth reueale to euerie man his predestination: For, what can be more certaine, than this demonstration? Whosoeuer doe truelie beleeue in Christ, they are elect to eternall life in Christ: but I truelie beleeue in Christ: therefore I am elected. But some make an exception, and say, that this were a demonstration, and that most certaine and euident, if a man might be able to knowe, that he were indewed with true faith in Christ: but here lieth all the difficultie. For many thinke that they trulie beleeue in Christ, whereas neuertheles, their faith is hypocritall and tēporary, as appeareth by the Euangelists.
               
                  Ansvver. We graunt, that they which beleeue by such a faith, which is in hypocrisie▪ and only lasteth for a time▪ that they

are deceiued, whilst they thinke, that they doe trulie beleeue, and yet do not indeed:They which do trulie beleeue, know that they beleeue. for they are like them, which dream that they are Kings, when as they are very beggers: but we say, that they which beleeue by a true faith, doe knowe, whether they trulie beleeue or no: and they are not deceiued, when they say, and think that they trulie beleeue. For, they are like vnto thē, which handeling a pretious stone, by reason that they are indued with sense, know and say, that they handle it. And if no man might certainly know, whether he beleeued truly or not, why doeth the Apostle say, Trie your selues,
                  2. Cor. 13.65 
                  vvhether you bee in the faith? And if it be so, no man can euer certainlie know, whether he be justified, considering that they onlie, which trulie beleeue, can be justified. And if a man, giuing credit to another mans words, doth certainly knowe, that he beleeueth him, how much more doeth he know it, which being indued with true faith by the holy Ghost, beleeueth the Gospell? In a word, godlie Writers haue prooued against School-men, that they, which are indued with true faith in Christ, cannot bee ignorant of it. But (say they) no man is certaine of his perseuerance in faith: And therefore, out of this vniuersall proposition,

                  He vvhich beleeueth, namelie, vvith a true and constant faith, is elected to life: no man can conclude that he is elected, by reason, that albeit hee may knowe, that hee is indued with true faith, yet he cannot tel, whether it shal be perpetuall. This collection is absurde: & the learned haue fully prooued, that true faith is perpetual. And therfore, they which certainly know, that they beleeue in a true faith, are also certaine, that the same their true faith, shall neuer perish in this world: partlie, for the promise of God,Ier. 32.40. 
                  I vvill put my feare into their hearts, that they may neuer depart from me: and partlie for the prayer of Christ, I haue praied for thee, Peter,
                  Luk. 22.33 
                  that thy faith doe not faile. Seeing it is so, it is very certain, that God by his word, in which generallie he saith, that all the faithfull are elect, doeth reueale to euerie man his election: cōsidering that the proposition taken out of the Gospell, is most certaine: and euerie faithfull man may assume to himselfe, that he is indewed with true faith in Christ.
               
                  Vers. 3. By the effects of predestination, a man may gather his predestination.The third way, by which God reueleth to euery one of vs his predestination, is by the effects of predestination, as wel inward in vs, as outward: by which, as by certaine markes imprinted in vs, he doeth seale vs to himselfe in Christ: and doth so

seale vs, that if we shall giue diligent heed, we may thereby euidently perceaue, that we are set apart from the common sort of men, which is often called by the name of the world: that we are foreknowen for his sonnes, and loued in Christ, and predestinated to eternall life; yea, and that we appertaine no longer to the world, but to that Citie which is aboue, that hath his foundation as the Apostle saith.Heb. 11.12. And wee haue a two fold reason of this argument: one, because these effectes (of which wee speake, and which we will afterward handle) God worketh not in any, but his elect as also afterward wee will shewe. Therefore, by right a man may, by a true feeling and experience of these effects in himself, be assured of his particular election, and predestination, to haue fellowshippe with Christ in all his graces. For predestination (as Augustine witnesseth) is a preparation to the blessings of God, by which most certainly they are made free,The effectes of predestination which are in vs, are like seals imprinting the image of Gods electi- in vs. whosoeuer are made free: therefore whosoeuer feeleth himselfe freed through these graces of God, may be assured and certified of his predestination. The other reason is, that these effects are not onely the effects simplie of predestination, but also such effectes they are, that they may also may be

                  
                     〈1 page duplicate〉

seals of it: namlie, in printing in vs a liuely form and image of God, foreknowing vs, louing vs, electing vs. And therefore, albeit wee cannot see the purpose, the foreknowledg, the election and predestination of God, as concerning our selues, in God himselfe foreknowing, willing, and electing vs: yet wee may beholde in our selues, som sure representations of al these imprinted, and euen stamped in vs by the word: and so by the beholding of these formes and impressions in our selues, wee shall easily be brought to the knowledge of those patterns (as it were) which are in the Lord himselfe. The matter (by reason it is very good and comfortable) may be declared by a similitude: God is like vnto the Sunne in regard of vs: the sunne when it shineth vpon vs, and after a sort looketh vs in the face, it doth after such a sort imprinte an image of his light in our eies, that wee also in like manner beeing made partakers of his light, may looke againe vpon the sunne it selfe, and vpon his light; for the light of the Sunne, and his beams being sent down vpon vs, are beaten back and reflected againe towardes the sunne. So in like maner, the forknowledg of god by which he hath and would acknowledg vs for his, from all eternitie; it alwaies

resteth in God, and cannot of it selfe bee perceaued of vs. But yet whilst God doth acknowledg vs for his, hee doth portrait in vs his elect, a certaine forme and image of his foreknowledge: by which, hee maketh vs, renouncing all other gods, to acknowledge him for our onely true God. Thus it commeth to passe, that through this true knowledge of God, which hee vouchsafeth vs, and by which wee doe acknowledg God, for our God and Father: we may after a sort, beholde in God himselfe his foreknowledg, by which he hath foreknowen vs for his sonnes. For first of all, God doth acknowledg vs for his, and then the electe being made partakers of this his light and knowledg, hee causeth vs in like maner to acknowledg him. To this purpose serueth that, which our Sauiour Christ saith: first, (saith he) I knowe my sheep, after he addeth, and again,Ioh. 10.14 I am knowen of mine. As though he should say, whiles I acknowledg them for my sheep, I make them, by meanes of this my light & knowledg, that they also can acknowledg me for their pastor. So the Apostle saith to the Galathians: When yee shall knowe God, or rather are known of him: he teacheth therefore, that God knewe the Galathians, because he had first acknowledged

them for his, in his eternall Predestination: And by giuing vnto them this his wisdome,Col. 4.9. he made them acknowledge the true God, for their God. The same may be said of the loue of God, by which hee loued vs in Christ to euerlasting life, before the foundation of the world; God by louing vs doth print in our heartes the Image of his loue, by which wee may loue him again from our hearts: and as it wer, by the reflection of the sun-beames, sent downe into our heartes, wee may be prouoked to loue againe. For the loue of god to vs being eternall, and causing eternall life, begetteth in the time appointed, a certaine loue in vs, seruing for his eternal glory. And to this purpose is that of saint Iohn:1▪ Ioh 4.10. 
                  not that vvee first loued God, but becaus he first loued vs. As though hee had saide, therefore wee loue God, because hee first, that is, before the foundatiō of the world louing vs in Christ, by the ingrauing of his loue in our hearts, causeth vs to loue him againe as a Father. So loue is saide, (to wit,1. Iohn. 4.7. Rom. 5.5. that loue, by which we loue God) to be of God: that is to proceede of the loue of God towardes vs. And Paul writeth, that the loue of God, (namely, that loue, by which hee loued vs) to be shed in our heartes by the holy Ghost, which is

giuē vs: And by this shedding of the loue of God in our harts, it commeth to passe, that loue is also wrought in our heartes towardes God. And therefore, by that sound loue by which wee feele our selues to loue God: we are made to knowe how great that loue of God is, by which he loued vs, from all aeternitie in Christ. And what is that loue els, but predestination?
               In like manner, election, by which hee singled vs from the rest of the worlde in Christ, that we might be holy before him; begets in vs a certain image, euen of God himself, that is, another electiō, by which, wee renouncing all other gods which are worshipped in the world, make our choise of this our true God Iehouah, to bee our God, that hee may be alwaies before our eies, hee which sanctifieth vs, and the Authour of our whole saluation. Wherfore, through this cōstant election, which is in vs, we perceiue that that election which is in God as concerning vs, is firm and sure; not onely as wee gather the cause by the effect, but also, as wee gather the pattern by the picture: like as by the similitude of the forme of a seale, fashioned in wax, we doe easilie vnderstande, what is the very forme and fashion of the seale. Therefore it is manifest, that it is the maner of God,

by the effectes of his election and predestination imprinted in vs, to reueale to euerie one of vs, his own election and predestination: And that two waies, both because there are certaine effectes of predestination, and by the effects, the causes are knowen: and also because there are certaine liuely types of Gods fore-knowledg and election, by which we are sealed vppe vnto God.
               Now by the imprinting of these forms and types in vs, as the seale is in wax: the verie first patterns themselues are known what they are.
               Furthermore, that there is no man elected to eternal life, which shall not be sealed vp in the time appointed, with these marks of Gods election: It is manifest out of these places of Scripture, which treat of election and predestination. The Apostle teacheth,Ephes. 1.4 Rom. 8.30. 
                  that vvee vvere elected, that vvee might be holie, and vvithout blame. Also hee teacheth, that all they whome God hath predestinated, are likewise called, and justified, and, by consequent, indued with faith, and knowledge of God, by which they take him for their Father, with loue also, wherewith they loue him as a Father; also, with a good will & constant purpose, by which they desire constantlie his glorie.

Againe, he saith in another place, The foundation standeth sure,
                  2. Tim. 2.19. 
                  hauing this seale (in respect of God) the Lord knovveth vvho are his. Now, in respect of vs, he putteth down another seale, saying: Let him depart from iniquitie, vvhich calleth vpon the name of the Lord: For with this marke, all the elect are branded. They call vpon the name of the Lord, and depart from iniquitie: seeking after holinesse & a good conscience. And this is that sealing, which is so often mentioned in the Scriptures. As when in the Apocalypse it is said,Apoc. 2.3 that an innumerable multitude was sealed to the Lord. For, like as the Father sealed Iesus Christ, as he was man and Mediatour, so also, the rest of his children he hath sealed, and doth daylie seale, with sure notes and seales,Ioh. 6.27. to distinguish them from other men,2. Cor. 1.21. and the children of this age. For, God is said to haue annointed vs, and sealed vs, and giuen vs the earnest of his Spirit in our hearts. And againe, to haue sealed vs with the holie Spirit of promise,Eph. 1.13. & 4.30. and that to the day of redēption. As it is easie to discerne a right seale from a counterfeit, so the true soules of God (by the sealing of the Spirit) are distinguished from Hypocrits, and lawfull children, from bastards.
               It remaineth, that wee shoulde declare

some effects of predestination:The chiefe effects of predestination, by which the elect ar discerned from the Reprobate. by which, as by marks and seales, the elect may bee discerned from Reprobats. The first effect of predestination, is Christ himselfe, as he is a Mediatour and a Sauiour, dwelling in our hearts by his holie Spirite. For, as we are elected in him, and by him redeemed, so by the sprinkling of his blood, wee are cleansed and sealed; and by his dwelling in vs, quickned (for he is our life, and that eternall) and therfore, we are seuered frō Reprobates, which alwaies remaine in death, as in the holie Scriptures we are taught. We say, that this is the first effect of Predestination, because we can enjoy none of the gifts of God, either of election, vocation▪ or justification, except in Christ, and by Christ: For he hath powred out all the effectes of Predestination into vs. In that therefore, euery elect faithfull man feeleth Christ to dwell in him, and to quicken him; he hath a seale in himselfe, by which he may knowe, that he was elected to euerlasting life in the same Christ: A part and beginning of which life, is this spirituall life, by which wee now liue to God. And as euerie man knoweth himself to be the sonne of God in Christ, because he calleth vpon God from his heart, as a Father: So he may conclude, that he is

predestinated to be the sonne of God, for Christs cause: And that by this first note, the faithfull may know, that they are elect to eternall life; the Apostle sheweth, knovv ye not (saith he) your selues,
                  2. Cor. 13.5. 
                  that Iesus Christ is in you, except ye be Reprobates? And no doubt a type of this kinde of sealing, was that sealng, whiche was done in Aegypt, by the blood of the Lambe: namely, when the houses of the Israelites were sprinkled with this blood, that they might be discerned from the houses of the Aegyptians, and so bee passed ouer vntouched of the Angell. And by Christe, as by the chiefe effect: yea, and the cause to of all the effectes which followe; all other effects of predestination are put into vs, and we are sealed with them. The Apostle nameth three principals; our calling (to wit,Rom. 8.30 effectuall) our justification, and glorification. This third effect, we shall obtaine in the life to come, the two first in this life. And to these two, may very well be referred all other, which we receiue in this life by Christ: with the effectuall calling, wee joyn a sound hearing of the word of God, and the vnderstanding of it, accompanied with great and constant delight and joy, faith also, and a true knowledge of the Deitie, humanitie, and office of Christ.

Vnto iustification, wee refer a perswasion of the remission of our sins by Christ (for by this we are iustified:) and regeneration too, or sanctification, and renouation of life, a good conscience, loue not faigned, a pure hart and cleane, patience in aduersitie, and boasting in tribulation, all good workes and fruits of the spirit: ad hereunto the crosse it selfe, which wee beare for the trueth of the Gospel; wherefore, whosoeuer feeleth that he is effectually called, that hee doth willingly heare the worde, that he doth beleeue the Gospell, that he is sure of the remission of his sinnes, that hee burneth with true loue to his neighbour; that he is bent to euerie good work; he cannot but must needes be perswaded of his election: for God onely doth communicate these vnto the Elect. Therefore it is plaine, that the elect are confirmed in the assurance of their election, by the effectes of predestination: and that there is a threefold way, by which God reuealeth to euery man his predestination.
               But if any shal take an occasion the rather of doubting of his election,The weaknes of our faith, as touching our eternal election, by what staies it may be held vp. then of confirming himselfe in it, of that which hath bin spoken, as concerning the fruits of the Spirit, and the effects of predestination: and that peraduenture, because hee

can feele in himselfe few and verie weake fruites of regeneration and election; yet let him not bee discouraged, neither let him doubt of his election, but let him vnderset himselfe with these props. First of all, if euer he truelie felt in himselfe, that testimonie of the Spirite, (which before I mentioned) namelie, that he is the sonn of God: let him know vndoubtedlie, that he is such a one, and therfore elected to eternall life: For, the holie Ghost neuer beareth record, or perswadeth a man of that, which is false; for he is the spirite of truth. And they are not the sonnes of God, except they haue bene predestinate (as the Apostle saith) to adoption by Christ: And none that is the sonne of God, and a man elected, can be made a reprobate, and the childe of the Deuill. Therefore, albeit he feele in himselfe both fewe and feeble effects of regeneratiō, yet let him not doubt of his election▪ otherwise, he shall disgrace the testimonie, which he hath receiued of the holie Ghost; yea, and that to, which as yet he enjoyeth; although peraduenture, by reason that his mind is troubled by euill affections, that testimonie of the holie Spirite, can scarse be heard in him. For the true testimonie of our adoption by the holy Ghost, being once giuen vnto our

spirit, lasteth for euer; although it is other whiles heard more plainlie, and at other times is more slenderly and scarce perceiued. But how (say you) may I know, whether that testimonie doth proceed frō the holie Ghost,How a man may knowe, whether the testimonie, which is giuen of the Spirit, be of of the spirit or not. and therfore, whether it be a true and certain testimonie. I answer, first, by the perswasion: secondly, by the maner of the perswasion: lastlie, by the effects of this testimonie and perswasion. For the first, the holy Ghost doeth not simplie say it, but doth perswade with vs, that we are the sonnes of God: and no flesh can doe this. Againe, he perswades vs by reasons, drawne, not from our works, or from anie worthines in vs, but from the alone goodnes of God the Father, and grace of christ. In this manner the Deuill will neuer perswade any. Lastlie, the perswasion of the holy ghost is ful of power; for, they which are perswaded, that they are the sonnes of God, cannot, but needs must call him Abba, Father, and in regarde of loue to him, doe hate sin, and whatsoeuer is disagreeing to his will: and on the contrarie, they haue a sound and a hartie desire to do his will. If at anie time thou hast felt in thy selfe any such testimonie, perswade thy selfe, it was the testimonie of the holie Ghost: and that very true & certain to: &

therfore, that thou art the child of God, & predestinate to eternal life. This is the first proppe, by which wee must vnderset that weake beleefe we haue, of our certain election to eternal life. Again, hold this without wauering, whosoeuer thou art, that art tempted to doubt of thy election: euen as nothing is required at our handes to worke our election, (for God chose vs of his onlie meer goodnes) so that we may trulie know, whether we bee elect or not; this one thing shall be sufficient; namelie, if we shal attain to the certain knowledge of this, that we are in Christ, and partakers of him: for, he that is nowe ingrafted into Christ, & is justified, it cannot be, but that he was elected in Christ, before the foundation of the worlde. And that wee may be in Christ, Faith is both required, and is sufficient; not perfect faith, but true faith, though it be so litle, that it be like a graine of mustarde seed, and feeble, like a young borne babe, and that sore diseased to. Now, that faith, which is a liuelie and a true faith, lasteth alwaies, as hath bene before declared, neither can it at any time altogether faile. And so it commeth to passe, that they which once haue ben truly ingrafted into Christ, remaine alwaies & continue in him, according to that saying.

                  All that my father giueth me, shall come to me: & he which commeth vnto me, I wil not cast forth. This is true, no doubt, that look how much the faith is more perfect, so much the greater power it hath, to knit vs more to Christ: and therefore, we must alwayes endeuour to increase in Faith. Yet for all that, this is most certaine; one litle sparke of true faith, is sufficient to ingraft vs into Christ. And for that cause, we must in no wise doubt of our ingrafting into Christ, and of our election to; by reason of the weaknesse of Faith, and of the small and slender fruits it bringeth out.
               But how shal I certainly know (say you) whether my Faith be a true & liuely Faith or not?Whereby a man may knowe whether his faith be a true faith or not. Out of the same groundes, from whence the testimonie of our adoption is perceiued. First of all, if you shall trulie feele, that you are perswaded of the truth of the Gospell; yea, and that all your sins are pardoned you for Christ, and you receiued to fauour. Againe; if you see that this perswasion is grounded, not vpon any merits of yours, but on the sole goodnesse of God, and grace of Christ.
               Lastly, if you feele such a confidence to approch vnto, and call vpon the Father, & such a loue towards him, and his son Iesus Christ, that ye do hate and detest whatsoeuer

is against his glorie, (as all sinne) and on the contrarie, bee caried away with a desire to doe those things, which serue for the aduancing of his glorie: and therfore, that you loue all those, which desire and seeke the same, as the brethren & friendes of Christ. For these be the effectes, which can neuer be seuered from true Faith. And this is the disposition of true faith: therefore, as long as thou feelest these effects in thy selfe, albeit, verie slender, and greatlie languishing: yet assure thy selfe, thou art indewed with true Faith, although it bee weake, and therefore thou art in Christ; yea, and in Christ elected to. Wherefore, thou must not doubt of thy saluation and election, by reason of thy daylie slips, proceeding from thy weaknesse of Faith, no, not for haynous crimes; like as neither Dauid, for his adulterie and murther, nor Peter for his threefold deniall, did dispair of their election: which appeareth, in that being plunged in the verie gulfes of their temptations, they held fast their Faith, as an anchor, and called vppon God, This is the second propp. Lastlie, in no wise wee must forget; namelie, that our election is certaine, and immutable: and therefore, as it is done without respect of any works of ours, so in like sort, it can neuer be chā
                  ged

by any of our euill deserts. For as it is first proceded from the only free purpose of God, so it is grounded thereon. True it is, we prouoke Gods wrath against vs by our sins, and neither wil God let them escape vnpunished, but hee chastiseth vs by diuers, both inward & outward scourges; as may appeare in Dauid aboue all other: Yet for al that, it is his good pleasure, that for his goodnes sake and trueth, for the obediēce of Christ, that his purpose shuld remaine sure, and our election. So it commeth to passe, that he giueth vs repentāce anew, to raise vs vp, & to receiue vs to fauour. Therfore, although for the present, thou feelest thy selfe to be of weake faith, and to haue fallen to diuers sinnes: Yet, whereas heretofore, thou hast had many and euident testimonies of thy election, as the testimony of the holie Ghost, and the testimonie taken from Faith, & the effects of Faith: at this present assuredlie thou canst not doubt of thy electiō, for thy sins committed, but thou shalt much derogate from this free election, and also from the testimonies of thy election heretofore injoyed; yea, & those which yet thou enjoyest. For, if thy sinnes displease thee, & thou desirest to liue without blame, onely for that thy sins displease thee; why, now thou

hast a new testimonie of thy election: For, such repentance as this is, is onely proper vnto the elect. Therefore, by these three proppes we must vphold our faith, as touching euerie ones particular election. And thus much as concerning the certaintie, with the which euerie man must bee perswaded, that he is elected in Christ to eternal life, before the foūdation of the world.
            
            
               ASSERTION. II.
               
                  Whosoeuer are predestinate to the end, they are also predestinate to the means, vvithout vvhich they cannot attaine to the end: and therefore, as the elect necessarilie at length doe come vnto the end, by reason of the certaintie of their election: so also, by reason of the same certainty, it is necessary, that they should bee traced through those means, vvhich tend to the same end.
               
               
                  WEe must mark the end to which we are predestinate,The ende of our predestination. & to which we say, that one day wee shal be brought: for there is a double end of our election: the one concerneth the elect themselues, namely their glorification, or their eternall life and glorie in heauen. Of which is spoken Rom. 8. The other concerneth God himselfe, which chuseth, namly, the glory of God: that is, that the glory of his grace may be known and eternally made manifest, of which, is

mention made. Ephes. 1. Both of them are so coupled together, that whosoeuer are praeelected to the first, are also predestinat to the latter, and the latter followeth of the former. For the more wee shall be made partakers of the grace of God, & the heauenly glory: so much also more and more shall the glory of God be made manifest in vs. But because the end, which concerneth God, is almost all one in the reprobatiō of the wicked, and in the predestination of the Saints: namely, that as by the saluation of these, which procedeth of his meere goodnes, the glory of his grace is made manifest: so also by the iust damnation of the other, the glory of his diuine iustice may be made knowen to al: Neuerthelesse, considering that the end, to which the elect shall attaine, is farre diuers from that (for it is eternall life) vnto which the reprobates are appointed (for that is eternall death:) therefore the end, of which we treate in this assertion, is our eternall glorification, and euerlasting life in Heauen.
               Let vs nowe see in the second place, what are those meanes,The means to which we are predestinate how manie they bee. by which the elect are brought vnto this end: and therefore to which meanes we hold, that al are predestinate, whosoeuer are predestinate to

the end? And they are of two sortes, some of them are soe necessarie vnto all, that without them, no man simplie can attaine vnto eternall life and glorie: and they are Christs, as he is mediator and high Priest, and his obediēce and iustice (for without Christ no man can be saued:) also our effectual calling to Christ, by the holy ghost; and that which followeth this, is our iustification, yea, and our regeneration to. For these foure, predestination, vocation, iustification, and glorification, are so linked together, that it is not possible to seuer the one from the other. And therfore, no man can be glorified, which is not iustified; and no man can be iustified, which is not effectually called; as also, no man can be effectually called, which is not predestinate: therfore without these, not so much as children and infants, can bee brought to this end of eternal glorie. And therfore euen al the elect infants are inwardly, in a certain peculier maner, by the holy ghost, called, and iustified, and glorified. Nowe, there are some certaine meanes annexed vnto these, albeit they haue no place in infants, by reason of their age, yet they belong to all other elect, howsoeuer they are found in som more plenteous and liuely, and in other some more slēder and weak.

As namely, a liuely faith, the hearing of the word, a detestation of sinne, the loue of righteousnes, patience in aduersitie, a care to do good workes (and such like) all which, the Apostle comprehendeth vnder the name of good workes, when he saith, that vve are created, that is, borne a new in Christ, vnto good vvorks, vvhich God hath prepared,
                  Eph. 2.20 
                  that vve might vvalk in them, that is, that we might lead our liues in them, and so walking, at length might come to eternall life: for without thē, we cannot come to eternall glory; but by them God traileth vs thyther. Therefore we say, that all which are elect to that end, are also predestinate to the same meanes. For predestination is not onely of the end, but also of the means, which concern the end and all, as well the end as the meanes, are the effectes of predestination. And therefore, it is very true which Augustine saith, Predestination (saith he) is a preparation to the graces of God, by which they indeed ar freed, whosoeuer ar freed.
               
                   Therefore the first gift of God (that we may briefly consider the effectes of predestination) prepared for all the elect,The first benefit of god, predestnating vs, is Christ. without which, they can in no wise come to the end▪ and therefore the first effect of predestination is our Lord Iesus, vvith his obedience,

merites, death, resurrection, glorie: namely, in that respect he is made Mediator betweene God the father and vs, and the head of al the elect. And therfore, in as much as he is such a one, he is also the cause of all other graces and benefits, which come vnto vs by the free predestination of God. For, the effectes of predestination, are so ordered among themselues, that the first which go before, are the causes efficient, or (if wee will so speake) the materiall causes of the latter, and those that follow. Therefore, seeing Christ is the first effect of predestination, he is also the cause of all other effectes, by whome wee are made partakers of them. The Apostle therfore, doth very well to the Ephesians: In the first place,Eph. 1.4. &c. (saith he) We are elected in Christ, namely, as in the head, to be his members. Secondly, he writeth, that we ar predestinat to adoption by Christ, namely to obtaine it, for wee are adopted into the sonnes of God in Christ, the first begotten sonne of God, and by making vs partakers of his Sonneship, we are really made the sonnes of God: yea, and we are also indewed with his spirit too, that wee might be borne anew. Thirdly, (he saith) wee are made acceptable and beloued vnto the Father, & his beloued sonne, namly, Christ. Fourrhly,

that wee haue our redemption in the same Christ, by his bloud, and haue obtained remission of sinnes, and all wisdome and vnderstanding. Fiftly, that in the same Christ, all thinges are reconciled, as wel in Heauen, as in earth. In a worde, the Apostle sheweth there (as also else were) that whatsoeuer benefites we do, or shall hereafter obtaine, counting from our eternall election, euen vnto our glorification: all those we nowe do, and shall obtaine hereafter in Christ, and by Christ. Therefore, whosoeuer are elected to eternall life, besides this, that they are elected in Christ, they are also predestinate to Christ, that is, to haue fellowship with him, that they may by him enioy all other benefites. The  second benefit of God, and effect of our predestination, is our effectual calling to Christ: and to his Gospell,
                  2. Tim. 1.5 Rom. 8.30 
                  in which the elect are onelie called: Because it is by the purpose and grace of God, which is giuen vs in Christ: And an effectuall calling is knowen by the effects, two of which proceede directly from it: a harty kinde of hearing the word, and the conceauing of it with a very greate, constant and continuall delight, and a true, and sure beliefe of the worde of the Gospell.Iohn. 8.47 Thence it is that Christ saith, who is of God (saith he) namely, by election and effectuall

calling, heareth the word of God, very willingly, and from his heart and that cō
                  tinually: but ye heare not, because yee are not of God. And this calling is wrought not onely by the preaching of the word, (as it is in al that be of yeeres) but also, (and that chieflie) with the inwarde inspiration of the holy Ghost, whiles that the Father draweth them by his spirit, whom he will haue to come to Christ: Which also was said to be done in infants. For this calling is the beginning of saluation, euen in this life: and therfore it is the Apostles manner, in the beginning of his Epistles, to make mention of this calling, naming all the faithful, The Saintes called:Rom. 1.7. 1. Cor. 1.2 Therfore it must needes be, that all they which are elected in Christ, must also at length be effectually called, and drawen to Christ. After an effectuall calling, followeth Faith, the third effect of predestination, vvhich is saide to  be peculiar vnto the elect;Tit. 1.1 Heb. 11.6 And without which (as the Apostle saith) it is not possible to please God. For by it wee are engrafted into Christ, and are made the members of Christ, & without faith no man can be saued.
               
               And that this is an effect of predestination, the Apostle plainly sheweth,1. Cor. 7.25. when he saith, that he had obtained mercie (namely, in Gods eternal predestination) that he

might beleeue. Wherefore, whosoeuer ar predestinate to obtaine eternall life, in Christ and by Christ, they are also elect to haue the very gift of Faith. Therefore, it must needes be, that at length they shall beleeue in Christ. The fourth benefite is iustification,  that is, a free pardonning of our sinnes, and the imputation of the righteousnes of Christ, for it followeth Faith: because, vvhosoeuer ar indued vvith true faith in Christ, are also iustified. And that justification is an effect of predestination. The Apostle sheweth, when he putteth it after calling, before which he setteth predestination. And when hee saith, that we are elect in Christ, that wee might be holie,Rom. 8.30 Eph. 1.4. & without spot or blame in the presence of God: and that this is not done, while wee are in this world, but by the pardoning of all our faults, and by the imputation of his perfect obedience. Wherefore, it must needs be, that al the elect shal be justified, and be taken for most pure, & without blame in Gods presence. With iustification, is ioyned regeneration, and  sanctification by the holy Ghost: namelie, whiles vve are made new creatures by him, & the sons of God to: not onelie by adoption, but also by regeneration. For, when Christ justifieth vs, hee doth not only forgiue vs our vnrighteousnes, and impute his righteousnesse to vs,

but also he taketh from vs our stonie hart, and giueth vs a fleshie heart of his owne: and he strips vs of our olde man, and puts on his newe man. Lastly, he taketh away the corruption of our nature, and makes vs partakers of his diuine nature: and so indeed, of the sonnes of men, he makes vs the sonnes of God, and his brethren to. Therefore it is said, that we are predestinated to adoption, by Iesus Chrst,Eph. 1.4.5 Iohn. 3.6 and elect, that we may be holie, without blame, and that which is borne of the spirite, is called spirite. Therefore, the elected to eternall life, must needes bee begotten anew, to be the sonnes of God, and bee made partakers of the diuine nature, and be a newe creature in Christ, Hence issueth the sixt effect of predestination, which is heedfullie to be regarded: the loue of righteousnesse, &  the detestation of sinne. For in regeneration, the affections are principallie chāged. Namelie, the affections of the corrupt nature and flesh, into the affections of the diuine nature & spirite. Hence it is, that the Apostle saith, that they which are borne anew,Rom. 8.1 & 5. do walke according to the spirite, and not after the flesh: and not to sauour the thinges of the flesh, but the things of the spirite. And the chiefe affections of the flesh, are the loue of sinne: that is, the concupiscence of the

flesh: and contrariwise, the hatred of righteousnes, and the lawe of God, which are not of the Father, but of the world. Therfore, the chiefe affections of regeneration and the spirit, are, the loue of righteousnes, and of the lawe of God, & the hatred of sin.Psal. 45 8. For that which is spoken chiefly of Christ: Thou hast loued righteousnes, and hated iniquitie: is to bee vnderstood of all the members of Christ, endued with his spirite, because it is trulie accomplished in them. Hence it is, that Dauid, who in himself did represent the disposition of all the regenerate,psa. 119.113 & 40.9. & 101.3 & 26 5. said of himselfe, I haue loued thy law, thy law is in the midle of my hart I haue hated all the works of iniquitie, I will not sit with the wicked.Rom. 7.22. Also Paule, I am delighted (saith hee) in the Lawe of God, according to the inner man: That is, in as much as I am borne anewe. And no mā doubteth, but that both these affections, are the effects of predestination, except he be ignorant, that all these are the gifts of God: which as in time, he bestoweth on his, so also, he hath decreed to bestow them on them, before the foundation of the world. And from these two affections,  being the first fruits of regeneration, ariseth a care & endeuour to doe good vvorks: that is, to flie sin, & to fulfil the Lawe of God, vvhich is

the seuenth effect of predestination. For hee which hateth any thing from his heart, he taketh heed of it as much as he can, and he flieth from it, and escheweth it: and on the contrarie, he which loueth any thing from his heart, that also hee seeketh after, and endeuoureth himselfe to the compassing of it. Therfore, the Apostle Iohn maketh this a chiefe difference,1. Ioh. 3 7. betweene the sonns of God, and the children of the deuill: that is, between them that are borne anew, and them that are not borne anew: that the children of God both loue, and doe righteousnesse, and the children of the deuill loue sinn, and doe it: as also, the deuil sinned from the beginning; & Christ came to dissolue the workes of the Deuill; namelie, in his elect; for, in the reprobate he leaueth them vntouched, because they are not giuen him of the father to be purged, borne anew, and saued. Therefore, seeing Christ was before ordayned, and predestinate to the doing of all these workes, and that there is no good wrought in vs, which was not prouided for vs in Christ, from al eternitie: it is a cleare case, that the care also of doing good workes, is an effect of predestination. And the Apostle plainlie teacheth it, when he saith,Eph. 2.10. that we were created in Christ to good works,

which God hath prepared, that we might walk in them. To this purpose, serueth that which the Apostle deliuereth of loue, not vnfaigned,
                  Eph. 1.4. 1, Tim. 1.19. to which he sheweth, that wee were elect, and of a good conscience
                  ▪ which he makes the inseperable companion of the faith of the elect. Lastlie, of a pure heart, which he ascribeth to the elect; considering the vnfaithfull haue nothing cleane in them,Tit 1.15. and that their mind and conscience is defiled. Now, that this care to doe good works, is necessarie in all the elect, Peter sheweth it,2. Pet. 1.10 when he bids vs endeuor to make our election and calling sure, by good workes, as some copies haue it. But to whom shall we make it sure? not vnto God, (for it was sure vnto him, before the foundation of the worlde) but vnto our selues, and to our neighbours. And this is one of the chiefest vses of good woorkes, that by them, not as by causes, but as by effects of predestination and Faith, both we, and also our neighbours, are certified of our election, and of our saluation to. Furthermore, considering whiles we haue a care to glorifie God, to do good works, and wee will not bee conformable to the world in the wickednes of it, neither submit our selues to our flesh, & Sathan: the flesh, the world, and Sathan, do perpetuallie

war against vs: & therwithal it cōmeth to passe, they being most valiant enemies, that eyther we are ouercome, or at the least, in fighting are foyled.
               And therfore, we are constrained to flie vnto the Lord, and to craue his assistance: Therefore, the eight effect of our predestination, is the calling vpon God, that in this fight, he wold giue vs aide against the Deuil, the worlde, and the flesh. For this is the propertie of the Spirite, which the elect haue, to stir them vp to prayer: for the Spirit it selfe maketh request for vs, vvith groninges vvhich cannot be vttered: that is to say, it mooueth vs to make request. And because we are sonnes, God hath sent the spirit of his sonne into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father.Rom. 8.29 Gal. 4.6. Psal. 50.15. And God biddeth vs call vpon him in the day of tribulation, promising to heare vs. From these proceedeth the ninth effect of predestination: namelie, a perpetuall repentance for our daylie slips, and a continuall desire to be bettered in godlines. So that also, for this cause chieflie, we hartily desire to be dissolued out of this world, and to be with Christ, for this end, that we might sin no more. For, this is a thing proper to the elect of God, euen now borne anew, as we may see in the Apostle, who speaketh thus, in the name of all the regenerate: O miserable man that

I am, vvho shal deliuer me from the bodie of this death?
                  Rom. 7.27 phil. 1.23▪
                   And againe, I desire to be dissolued, and to be with Christ.
               
               
                  From this ninth effect, proceedeth the tenth:  namelie, a desire that Christ may come, & make an end of all our miseries and sinnes, & perfectly restore his own kingdome. That this is proper to the elect,2. Tim. 4. 8 the Apostle sheweth, when he saith, that they loue the comming of the Lord: and Iohn bringeth in the Spouse of Christ, crying, Come Lord Iesu, come quicklie, Yea,Apoc. 22.17.20 and Christ himselfe hath taught vs to pray;Mat. 6.10 
                  Let thy Kingdome come: And because that they which pray on this wise, are also heard, according to Gods promise, In the day of tribulation call vppon mee,
                  Psal. 50.15 
                  and I vvill  heare thee: Thence appeareth the eleueth effect of predestination,
                  Rom. 5.3▪ & 8.28 
                  true patience: that is, not onelie true comfort, but also a reioycing in aduersitie, as the Apostle describeth it. And therefore a certaine taking vp of courage, and recouerie of strength against his enemies: Whereby it commeth to passe, that al things turne to the saluation of the elect. For the elect, albeit they be often beaten downe in fight, yet, because Christ speedilie sendeth ayde from heauen vnto them, they rise vp couragiously, and begin againe the fight, against sinne and the Diuel, and al other the enemies of Christ: and they fight so long, til they

be made conquerers, & are assured of the victorie, and of the crowne: which assurance also is an  effect of predestination, giuen to all the Electe. For what (saith the Apostle) shall we say to these things? If God be on our side,Rom. 8.31 Mat. 24.24. who can be against vs? Therefore our Lord Iesus techeth, that the elec
                     •
                   
                  
                     •
                  annot be seduced, and so perish, no not by the comming of Antichrist, and his miracles. And lastly, hence appeareth that last effect of predestination, vvhich vve can obtaine in this life, the gift of perseuerance, vnto the end, in faith and a true confession of Christ, ioyned with a manifest care to liue a godly life, & a desire to glorifie him; For this gift is bestowed vpon all the elect, as the Lorde promiseth by Ieremie: I will put my feare into their heartes,Ier. 32.4
                        •
                     
                   that they may not departe from me. And when they shal come to the end of their liues, they shall bee receiued into the heauenly glorie, vntill such time, as their bodies also being raised vp, they may take full possession of eternall life. Thus we see, that it is very certaine, that those which are elected to eternall life, ar also predestinate to vse those meanes, by which, as by certaine steppes and stayres, they climbe into that heauenly dwelling place. And therefore, that we were predestinate to these meanes, namely, Faith, Iustification,

and good workes, because wee were elected to eternall life, according to the purpose and grace of God.
               Wherefore, by this means the doctrine also of the Pelagians is confuted, as touching predestination to life,The vse of this doctrin. by our faith and workes, which God foresaw we shuld do. Whereas on the contrary, therefore God did predestinat vs to faith, and good workes, because he did choose vs to eternal life.1. Cor. 7.25. For the Apostle saith not, I obtained mercie, because I was faithfull, or because I should be faithfull, but that I might be faithfull. Neither saith he, that we are elected in Christ,Eph. 1.4.2 because we should be holy and without blame, but that vvee might be holy and vvithout blame. Neither doth he say, that we were created in Christ, becaus wee did or should do good workes, but we were created to good workes: vvhich God prepared, that vvee might vvalk in them. Lastly,Tit▪ 2.11. he saith not, that the grace of christ appeared, becaus we were to liue soberly, iustly, and godly, but that it therefore appeared, that we denying all vngodlines, & the lusts of this worlde, might liue soberly, iustly, & godly in this present vvorld. Wee see therfore, that by this doctrine, that wicked opinion is ouerthrowen, which teacheth, that we do preuent the grace of God

by our merites which God foresaw. And on the contrary, here wee see, how fowlly the belli-gods of this world are deceiued, which reason thus: If wee be predestinate to eternall life, and our predestination be certaine and vnchangeable, what neede we endeuour our selues, beleeue, or doe good workes? for howsoeuer it fall out, & howsoeuer the elect do liue, vndoubtedly they cannot perish, because they are predestinate to eternall life. Alas poore wretches, they see not, that they seuer those thinges that are to be conioyned: namely the end, and the meanes of the end: and that they breake the cheine, which in no wise, either can or must be loosed, whilst that they seuer their calling and iustification, yea, and Faith too, and good works, from predestination and glorification. As though God did glorifie them whome he did predestinate, before hee called and iustified them: yea, and before they can beleue, and shew their quick and liuely faith by workes. Contrariwise, let vs learn what our duetie is. If any be elect to eternal life, they also are predestinate to the meanes by which they come vnto it. And wee beleeue (as we are bound to do) that we are predestinate to eternal life: and therefore wee must also beleeue, that we haue bene

elected to Faith and good workes, that by them, as by certaine steppes, we might be brought to eternall life. And therefore, so far must we be from neglecting faith, and the meanes of good workes, and of a holy life: that contrariwise, it is rather our dutie to keepe faith in a good conscience, & to be conuersant in good workes, which God hath prepared, that we might walke in them. And because wee can neither attaine to the ende, nor the meanes that bring vs thereunto of our selues. Therefore it is our parts, to craue them at Gods hands by prayer, that hee woulde giue vs Faith, and a care to do good workes, and encrease them in vs. Nether must we onely ask them; but also certainly, trust that we shal obtaine them for Christ his cause. For, if for all them which are predestinated to eternall life, God hath prepared faith, by which they may beleeue, and good workes to walk in: therefore if wee beleeue (as by Gods commandement wee are bound) that wee are in Christ elected to eternall glory: we must also be perswaded, that before we depart hence, hee will giue vs true repētance, increase true faith, inflame vs with loue: lastly, that he wil minister vnto vs aboundantly, all thinges in Christ, to obtaine the end. Yea, this confidence

also and prayer, it is one effecte of predestination, by which wee get the rest. Therefore this doctrin we must hold, that predestination to eternall life: doeth not take away the meanes of obtaining it, but rather establish them. And therefore, both these principles are true; namely, that the elect to life cannot perish: and vnlesse a man beleeue in Christ,Ioh. 3.3. and perseuer vnto the end, in this faith working by loue, hee shall perish. The reason is, because in predestination, the meanes and the end of it are so ioyned together, that the one cannot be seuered from the other. Wherfore whosoeuer holdeth not the meanes vnto the end (amongst which faith is one) it is manifest, that hee was neuer predestinate, and therefore mu
                     ••
                   needes perish: as on the cōtrary, he which holdeth faith, must needes be saued. So the truth of these propositions is euident: hee which beleeueth in the son, hath eternall life: contrariwise, he which beleeueth not in the Sonne, the anger of God remaineth vpon him, because, as a constant faith is a sign of election: so obstinat infidelity, is a token of reprobation.
