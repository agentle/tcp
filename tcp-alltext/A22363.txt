               ❧A Proclamation for setling the Plantation of
Virginia.
            
               
                  WHereas the Colonie of Virginia, Planted by the
hands of Our most deare Father of blessed memory, for the propagation of
Christian Religion the increase of Trade, and the enlarging of his Royall
Empire, hath not hitherto prospered so happily, as was hoped and desired, A
great occasion whereof his late Maiesty conceiued to be, for that the
gouernment of that Colony was committed to the Company of Virginia,
encorporated of a multitude of persons of seuerall dispositions, amongst whom
the affaires of greatest moment were, and must be ruled by the greater number
of Uotes and Uoyces; And therefore his late Maiestie, out of His great
Wisedome, and depth of Iudgement, did desire to resume that popular gouernment,
and accordingly the Letters Patents of that Incorporation, were by his
Highnesse direction in a Legall course questioned, and thereupon iudicially
repealed, and adiudged to bee voyde; wherein his Maiesties ayme was onely, to
reduce that gouernment into such a right course, as might best agree with that
forme which was held in the rest of his Royall Monarchy, and was not intended
by him, to take away, or impeach the particular Interest of any priuate
Plantor, or Aduenturer, nor to alter the same, otherwise then should be of
necessity for the good of the publique: And wheras We continue the like care of
those Colonies and Plantations, as Our late deare Father did, and vpon
deliberate aduice and consideration, are of the same Iudgement that Our said
Father was of, for the gouernment of that Colony of Virginia; Now lest
the apprehension of former personall differences, which haue heretofore
happened (the reuiuing and continuing whereof Wee vtterly disallow, and
strictly forbid) might distract the mindes of the Plantors and Aduenturers, or
the opinion, that We would neglect those Plantations, might discourage men to
goe or send thither, & so hinder the perfecting of that worke, wherin We
hold the honor of Our deare Father deceased, and Our owne honour to be deeply
engaged; We haue thought fit to declare, and by Our Royal Proclamation to
publish Our owne Iudgement, and resolution in these things, which by Gods
assistance Wee purpose constantly to pursue. And therefore Wee doe by these
presents publish and declare to all Our louing Subiects, and to the whole
world, that Wee hold those Territories of Virginia and the
Sommer-Ilands, as also that of New England, where Our
Colonies are already planted, & within the limits & bounds wherof, Our
late deare Father, by His Letters Patents, vnder His great Seale of
England, remaining of Record, hath giuen leaue and liberty to His
Subiects to plant and inhabite, to be a part of Our Royall Empire, descended,
vpon Us and vndoubtedly belonging and appertaining vnto Us; And that We hold
Our selfe, aswell bound by Our Regal office, to protect, maintaine, and
support the same, and are so resolued to doe, as any other part of Our
Dominions:
            And that Our full resolution is, to the end that there may be one
vniforme course of Gouernment, in, and through all Our whole Monarchie, That
the Gouernment of the Colonie of Virginia 
                shall
immediatly depend vpon Our Selfe, and not be committed to any Company or
Corporation, to whom it may be proper to trust matters of Trade and Commerce,
but cannot bee fit or safe to communicate the ordering of State-affaires, be
they of neuer so meane consequence: And that therefore Wee haue determined,
That Our Commissioners for those Affaires, shall proceed according to the tenor
of Our Commission directed vnto them, vntill Wee shall declare Our further
pleasure therein. Neuerthelesse We doe herby declare, That Wee are resolued,
with as much conuenient expedition, as Our Affaires of greater importance will
giue leaue, to establish a Councell, consisting of a few persons of
vnderstanding and qualitie, to whom We will giue trust for the immediate care
of the Affaires of that Colony, and who shall be answerable to Us for their
proceedings, and in matters of greater moment, shall be subordinate and
attendant vnto Our Priuie Councell heere; And that We will also establish
another Councell to be resident in Virginia, who shall be subordinate
to Our Councell here for that Colonie; and that at Our owne charge We will
maintaine those publique Officers and Ministers, and that strength of Men,
Munition, and Fortification, as shall be fit and necessary for the defence of
that Plantation, and will by any course that shall be desired of Us, settle
and assure the particular rights and interests of euery Planter and Aduenturer,
in any of those Territories, which shall desire the same, to giue them full
satisfaction for their quiet and assured enioying thereof.
            And lastly, whereas it is agreed on all sides, that the Tobacco of
those plantations of Virginia and the Sommer Islands (which
is the onely present meanes for their subsisting) cannot be managed for the
good of the Plantations, vnlesse it be brought into one hand, whereby the
forreigne Tobacco may be carefully kept out, and the Tobacco of those
Plantations may yeeld a certaine and ready price to the owners thereof; Wee doe
hereby declare, That to auoid all differences and contrariety of opinions,
which will hardly be reconciled amongst the Planters and Aduenturers
themselues, We are resolued to take the same into Our owne hands, and by Our
seruants or Agents for Us, to giue such prices to the Planters and Aduenturers
for the same, as may giue them reasonable satisfaction and encouragement; but
of the maner thereof, Wee will determine hereafter at better leisure: And when
We shall haue concluded the same, We shall expect, that all Our louing Subiects
will readily conforme themselues thereunto.
            And in the meane time, because the importation and vse of
forreigne Tobacco, which is not of the growth of those Plantations, or one of
them, will visibly & assuredly vndermine and destroy those Plantations, by
taking away the meanes of their subsistence, We doe hereby strictly charge and
command, That Our late Proclamation, bearing date the ninth day of April last,
intituled, (A Proclamation touching Tobacco) shall in all points and
parts thereof, be duely and strictly obserued, vpon paine of Our high
displeasure, and such further penalties and punishments, as by the sayd
Proclamation are to be inflicted vpon the offenders. And We doe hereby aduise
all Our louing Subiects, and all others whom it may concerne, not to aduenture
the breach of our Royall Commandement in any of the premisses, We being fully
resolued, vpon no importunitie or intercession whatsoeuer, to release or remit
the deserued punishment of such, as shall dare to offend against the same,
seeing We holde not Our Selfe onely, but Our people interessed therein.
            
               Giuen at Our Court at White-Hall, 
the thirteenth day of May, in the first yeere of Our Reigne
  of Great Britaine, France, and Ireland.
               
            
            God saue the King.
