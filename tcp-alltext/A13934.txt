                  the faithfull church doth praye:
                  For pacience in aduerſitie.
                  and for the perfecte waye.

               Now ſuffer me to take no ſhame,
               for in thee doe I truſte.
               Let not my foes reioyce,
               nor make a ſkorne of me:
               And let them not be ouerthrowen,
               that put their truſt in thee.
               Confounded are al ſuche,
               whoſe doinges are but vaine,

               declare vnto me plaine.
               Direct me in thy ſtrength,
               and teache me I thee praye:
               Thou art my god and ſauioure
               that helpeth me euery day.
               thy mercies manifolde,
               I pray thee Lord remembre,
               And eke thy pitie plentiful,
               that doth endure for euer.
               Remembre not the faultes,
               and frailtie of my youth,
               Remembre not how ignoraunte,
               I haue been of thy truth.
               Nor after my deſertes
               let me thy mercy finde,
               But of thyne owne benignitie,
               Lorde haue me in thy mynde.
               His mercie is ful ſwete,
               his trueth the perfect waye.
               Therfore the Lord wil geue a lawe,
               to them that go aſtraye.
               For al the waies of God,
               are truth and mercie both,

               the witneſſe of his trouth.
               Now for thy holy name,
               O Lorde I thee entreate?
               To graunt me pardon for my ſynne,
               for it is wonderous greate.
               Who ſo doth feare the Lord,

               and wondrous excellent:
               Of ful great purpoſe and effecte,

                  not for the mans deſerte.
               
               THe man is bleſt whoſe wickednes,

                  Which in his heart hath hid no guile,
               nor fraude is found therein.
               For whiles that I kept cloſe my ſyn
               in ſilence and conſtrainte:
               My bones did waſte & weare away,
               with dayly mone and plainte.
               For night and day thy hand on me
               ſo greuous was and ſmarte:
               that al my bloud and humours moiſt,
               to drineſſe did conuerte

               Let euery good man pray therefore,

                  And bend mine eyes vpon thy wayes,
               and ſo ſhal thee preſerue.
               Be not therefore ſo ignoraunt,

               For many be the miſeries,
               that wicked men ſuſtaine:
               Yet vnto them that truſt in God,

               Who ſo thei be that him beholde,
               and ſhew him their vnreſt:
               He daſheth not their countenaunce,
               but graunteth their requeſt.
               Who ſo in their afflictions,
               vnto the Lorde doeth cal:
               He heareth their ſuite without delaye,
               and riddeth them out of thral.
               The angel of the Lord doth pitche
               his tentes in euery place:
               To ſaue al ſuch as feare the Lorde,
               that nothing them deface.
               Se and conſider wel therefore,
               that god is good and iuſte:
               
                  And thei bee bleſt that put in him,
               their onely faith and truſt.
               Feare ye the Lord his holy ones,
               aboue al earthly thing:
               For thei that feare the liuing Lorde,
               ars ſure to lacke nothing.
               the mightie and the rich ſhal want,
               yea thruſt and hunger much:
               But as for them that feare the Lorde
               no lacke ſhalbe to ſuche.
               Come nere therefore my children dere
               and to my word giue eare:
               I ſhal you teache the perfect waye,

               muſt earneſtly deuiſe:
               His tonges and lippes from al deceit
               to kepe in any wiſe.
               And turne his face from doing yl,
               and do the godly dede:
               Enquire for peate and quietnes,
               and folow her with ſpede,
               For why the eyes of god aboue,
               vpon the iuſt are bent:
               
                  His eares likewiſe are giuen much,
               to heare the innocent.
               the lorde doeth frowne & bende his browes,
               vpon the wicked traine:
               And cutteth away the memorie,
               that ſhould of them remaine.
               But when the iuſt doth cal and crie
               the Lord doth heare them ſo:
               That out of paine and miſerie,
               forthwith he letteth them go.
               The Lorde is kinde and merciful,
               to ſuche as be contrite:
               He ſaueth alſo the ſorowful
               the meke and poore in ſpirite.
               Ful many be the miſeries,
               that righteous men do ſuffer,
               But out of al aduerſities,
               the Lord doth them deliuer.
               the lord doeth ſo preſerue and kepe,

               To take a counſaile and conſpire.
               how thei may do me wronge
               agreing on a wicked worde,
               and do determine plaine,

               them ſelues do brag and boaſt.
               No man can yet by any meane,
               his brothers death redeme:
               Or make agrement acceptable
               vnto god for him
               Or pay the raunſome for his ſoule,
               that he may liue for euer,
               And taſt of no corruption,
               this lieth in no mans power,
               We ſee that wiſe men die aſſone:
               as foliſhe men and fonde:
               And both doe leaue to other men,
               their goodes and eke their londe,

               for euer to endure.
               We ſee againe it is not geuen,
               with riches to haue reſt:
               But in that point a riche man is,
               compared to a beaſt.
               This is the foliſhe way thei walke
               with pompe to get them fame,
               And al their frendes that folow them
               doe muche commende the ſame:
               Whome death wil ſoone deuour like ſhepe
               when thei are brought to hel:
               Then ſhal the iuſt in light reioyce,
               when thei in darkenes dwel.
               Yet for al this I truſt that god,
               wil ſaue my ſoule from paine:
               And from al ſuche infernal power,
               and comfort me againe.
               yf any man waxe wōderous riche,
               feare not I ſay therefore:
               Although the glory of his houſe
               encreaſeth more and more:
               For when he dieth of al theſe things
               nothinge ſhal he receyue:
               
                  His glory wil not folow him,
               his pompe wil take her leaue.
               Yet in this life he taketh him ſelfe.
               the happieſt vnder ſunne,
               And doth commende al other men,
               that doth as he hath dooen.
               But when he ſhal go to his kinde,
               where his forefathers be,
               He ſhal his fellowes finde ful darke,
               that light ſhal neuer ſee.
               A foliſhe man whom ryches hath,
               to honour thus prefarde:
               that doth not know and vnderſtande
               is to a beaſt comparde.

               Let them be glad and mery al,
               and chereful in their voyce.
               And ſinge out laude vnto the lorde,
               his name to magnifie:
               That ſitteth as a ſauiour,
               aboue the ſtarrie ſkie.
               That ſame is he that is aboue,
               within the holy place:
               
                  That father is of fatherleſſe
               and iudge of widowes caſe.
               that ſame is he that in one minde,
               the houſholde doth preſerue.
               that bringeth bondemen out of thral,
               when wicked men dooe ſterue.
               When thou wenteſt out in wildernes
               thy maieſtie did make,
               The earth to quake the heauens drop
               the mount Sinay to ſhake.
               thine heritage with droppes of grace
               ful liberally is weaſhte.
               And when thy people mourne & plaint
               by thee they be refreaſhte.
               there ſhal thy congracion dwel,
               where thou doeſt poinct the place:
               Yea, for the poore thou doeſt prepare,
               of thine eſpecial grace.
               thou dooeſt commende thy worde O Lorde
               and giue thine holy ſpirite:
               To al that preach thy ghoſpel pure.

                  The houſholde of the liuing Lord:
               ſhal then deuide the ſpoile.
               Then ſhal the churche be innocent,
               and white as ſiluer fine:
               And in good life more oriently,
               then beaten golde ſhal ſhine.
               When he that ruleth earthly kinges,
               the earth ſhal order ſo
               Then ſhal the hil of Salmon be,
               as white as milke or ſnowe.
               Sens Baſan is the hil of god,
               and fruictful euery whit:
               Then ye the membres of that hil,
               why hope ye out of it?
               Sens god is pleaſed wonders wel
               to dwel within this hil:
               And therein doth determine plaine,
               for to continue ſtil.
               whoſe charettes & his angels eke,
               be thouſandes on a thronge:
               As in the mounte of Sinay,
               the Lord is them among.
               the Lord aſcended vp on hye,
               and led them bound with him:
               
                  That longe before in bondage laye,
               of death and deadly ſinne.
               And as man receyued giftes,
               and gaue them vnto men:
               yea, to his foes he gaue his ſpirite,
               that god might dwel in them.
               Now praiſed be the Lord therfore,
               and dayly let vs prayſe,
               Our god that with his benefites,
               doth proſper vs alwayes.
               He is the god from whom alone,
               ſaluacion commeth plaine,
               He is the god by whome we ſcape,
               from euerlaſting paine.
               this god wil woūd his enemies head
               and breake the heary ſcalpe:
               Of thoſe that in their wickednes,
               continually do walke.
               From Baſan wil I bring ſaied he
               my people and my ſhepe,
               And al mine owne as I haue dooen.
               from daunger of the depe.
               and make thē dip their fete in bloud
               of thoſe that hate my name:
               
                  And dogges ſhal haue their tōges embrewed,
               with licking of the ſame.
               al men may ſee how thou O God,
               thine enemies doeſt deface,
               And how thou goeſt as god and king
               into thy holy place.
               the ſingers go before with ioy.
               the minſtrels folow after,
               And in the middes the damſels playe
               with timbrel and with taber.
               Now in thy congregations,
               O Iſrael praiſe the Lorde,
               And from the bottom of thy harte,
               geue thankes with one accorde.
               Thy chiefe is litle Beniamin
               Thy counſaile princes bene
               Of Iuda and of zabulon
               and eke of Nepthalim.
               As god hath geuen power to thee
               ſo Lord make firme and ſure
               the thing that thou haſt wrought in vs
               for euer to endure.
               then for thy temples ſake ſhal kings
               geue giftes to thee alwayes:
               
                  Greater then al Hieruſalem,
               of euerlaſting prayſe.
               When thou ſhalt waſt the wauering folke,
               that rage againſt al ryght
               The ſtoute, the nice, the money men,
               and thoſe that loue to fighte.
               Then out of Egipt ſhal they come
               that long haue been ful blinde
               Then Gentiles then ſhal reconcile
               to god their ſinful minde
               then ſhal the kingdomes of the earth
               ſing praiſe vnto the Lorde,
               That ouer al doeth ſit and ſende
               to vs his mighty worde.
               therfore the ſtrength of Iſrael
               aſcribe to god on hie,
               Whoſe mightie power doth far extend
               aboue the cloudie ſkie.
               Goddes holynes is wonderful,
               and drad for euermore:
               And he wil geue his people power,
               prayſed be god therefore.

                     And how the good and godly men,
                  doo ſeldome liue in peace.
               
               HOw good is God to ſuche as be,
               of pure and perfecte harte:
               yet ſlip my fete away from him,
               my ſteppes decline aparte.
               and why becauſe I fondly fal,
               in enuie and diſdayne:
               That wicked men al thinges enioye,
               without diſeaſe or paine.
               and beare no yoke vpon their necke
               nor burthen on then backe:
               And as for ſtore of worldly goodes,
               thei haue no want or lacke.
               and free from al aduerſitie,
               when other men be ſhent,
               And with the reſt thei take no parte,
               of plague or puniſhement.
               whereby they be ful gloriouſly,
               in pride ſo high extolde:
               and in their wronge and violence,
               bewrapt ſo manifolde.
               that by aboundaunce of their goods
               thei pleaſe their appetite:
               
                  and do al thinges accordinglye:
               vnto their hartes delight.
               al thinges are vile in their reſpect,
               ſauing themſelues alone,
               Thei bragge their miſchief openly,
               to make their glory knowen.
               the heauen and the liuing Lorde,
               thei care not to blaſpheme,
               and loke what thing thei talke or ſay,
               the world doth wel eſteme.
               the flocke therefore of flatterers,
               dooe furniſhe vp their trayne,
               For there thei be ful ſure to ſucke,
               ſome profit and ſome gayne.
               Tuſhe tuſh ſay thei to them ſelues,
               is there a god aboue,
               That knoweth and ſuffereth al this il
               and wil not vs reproue
               Lo ye maye ſee howe wicked men,
               in riches ſtil encreaſe,
               Rewarded wel with worldly goodes,
               and liue in reſt and peace.
               Then why doe I from wickednes
               my phantaſie refraine,
               
                  And waſh my handes with innocētes
               and cleaſe my hart in vayne?
               and ſuffer ſcourges euery daye:
               as ſubiect to al blame,
               And euery morninge from my youth,
               ſuſtaine rebuke and ſhame.
               And I had almoſt ſaid as they,
               miſlikyng mine eſtate:
               But that I ſhould thy children iudge
               as folke vnfortunate.
               then I be thought me howe I might
               this matter vnderſtande:
               But yet the labour was to great
               for me to take in hande.
               Until the time I went into,
               thy holy place and then:
               I vnderſtode right perfectly,
               the ende of al theſe men.
               And namely how thou ſetteſt them
               vpon a ſlippery place,
               And at thy pleaſure & thy wyl,
               thou doeſt them al deface.
               then lord how ſone do thei conſume
               and fearefully decaye:
               
                  Much like a dreme whē one awaketh
               the ymage paſſeth awaye.
               Thus greued was hert ful ſore,
               my minde was much oppreſt,
               So fonde was I and ignoraunte
               and in thy ſight a beaſt.
               Yet ne

               to glory at the laſt.
               What place is there prepared then
               for me in heauen aboue?
               There is nothing in earth like the

               My fleſh and ek my hart do feare.
               but god doth faile me neuer,
               For of my heart god is the ſtrength,

                  The couenaunt and the wonderous workes
                  of god in Iſrael:
                  
                     And howe he troubled them with plagues,
                  and yet howe oft they fell▪
                  
               
               ATtende my people to my lawe,
               and to my wordes encline,
               My mouth ſhal ſpeake ſtraūge parables,
               and ſentences diuine.
               which we our ſelfes haue hard & ſene
               euen of our fathers olde:
               and whi
                     •
                  h for our enſtruction,
               our fathers haue vs tolde.
               Becauſe we ſhould not kepe it cloſe,
               from them that ſhould come after,
               But ſhew the power and glory of god
               and al his workes of wonder.
               With Iacob he the couenaunt made,
               how Iſrael ſhould liue,
               And made the fathers the ſame lawe,
               vnto their children giue.
               that thei and their poſteritie,
               that were not ſprong vp tho,
               Shuld haue the knowledge of the law
               and teache their ſeede alſo.
               That thei might haue the better hope
               in god that is aboue:
               
                  And not forget to kepe his lawes,
               and his preceptes in loue.
               Not being as their father were,
               a kinde of ſuch a ſpirite▪
               
               That would not frame their wicked hartes
               to know their god a right.
               How went the people of Ephraim,
               their neighbours for to ſpoyle:
               Shoting their dartes the day of war
               and yet they toke the foyle.
               For why they did not keepe with god,
               the couenaunt that was made:
               Nor yet wold walk or lead their liues
               according to his trade.
               But put into obliuion,
               his rounſaile and his wil:
               And al his workes moſt magnifique
               which he declareth ſtil.
               What wonders to our forefathers
               did he him ſelfe dicloſe:
               In Egipt within the fielde,
               that called is Thaneos.
               He did deuide and cut the ſeas,
               
                  that thei might paſſe at ones.
               And made the water ſtande as ſtil,
               as doth an heape of ſtones.
               He led them ſecret in a cloude,
               by day when it was bright:
               And al the night when darke it was,
               with fier he gaue them light.
               He brake the rockes in wildernes,
               and gaue the people drinke,
               As plenteous as when the depes,
               do flowe vp to the brinke.
               He drewe out riuers out of rockes,
               that were both drie and harde,
               Of ſuch abundaunce that no fluddes
               to them might be comparde.
               Yet for al this againſt the Lorde,
               their ſinne did ſtill encreaſe:
               And ſtirred him that is moſt high,
               to wrath in wildernes.
               Attempting him within their harts
               like people of miſtruſt:
               Requiring ſuch a kinde of meate,
               as ſerued to their luſt.
               
                  Saying with murmuration,
               in their vnfaithfulneſſe:
               Can not this god prepare for vs,
               a feaſt in wildernes?
               Behold he ſtrake the ſtony rocke,
               and flouddes forthwith did flowe,
               Doubt not that he can geue his folke
               both bread and fleſh alſo.
               Whē god herd this he waxed wrath,
               with Iacob and his ſeede:
               So did his indignacion
               on Iſrael procede.
               Becauſe thei did not faithfully,
               beleue and hope that he:
               Could alwaies helpe & ſuccour them,
               in their neceſſitie.
               Wherfore he did cōmaund the cloudes
               forthwith thei brake in ſunder:
               And rained downe Manna for thē to eate,
               a foode of mekil wonder.
               When erthly men with angels foode
               were fed with theyr requeſt:
               He bad the Eaſtwind blowe awaye,
               
                  and brought in the Southweſt.
               and rained down fleſh as thicke as duſt,
               and foule as thicke as ſande:
               Which he did caſt a midde the place,
               where al their tentes did ſtande.
               then did thei eate excedingly,
               and al men had their filles:
               Nothing did want to their deſier,
               he gaue them al their willes.
               but as the meate was in their mouthes
               his wrath vpon them fel:
               And ſlew the floure of al their youth,
               and choyſe of Iſrael.
               Yet fel thei to their wonted ſinne,
               and ſtil thei did him greue:
               For al the wonders that he wrought
               thei had no faſt beleue.
               their daies therfore he ſhortened,
               and made their honour vaine:
               Their yeres did waſt and paſſe away
               with terrour and with paine.
               But euer when he plagued them,
               thei ſought him by and by:
               
                  remēbring then he was their ſtrēgth,
               their helpe and god moſt hie.
               Though in their mouthes thei did but gloſe
               and flatter with the lord:
               And wt their tonges & in their lippes,
               diſſembled euerye worde.
               For why their hartes were nothing bent
               to him nor to his trade:
               Nor yet to kepe or to perfourme,
               the couenaunt that was made.
               yet was he ſtil ſo merciful,
               when thei deſerued to die.
               That he forgaue them their miſdedes
               and would not them deſtrie.
               yea many a time he turned his wrath
               and did him ſelfe auiſe:
               And would not ſuffer al his whole
               diſpleaſure to ariſe.
               conſidering that thei wer but fleſhe,
               and euen as a winde:
               That paſſeth awaye and can not wel,
               retourne by his owne kinde.
               How oftentimes in wildernes,
               
                  did they the Lorde prouoke?
               How did thei moue & ſtirre their lord,
               to plague them with his ſtroke?
               yea when thei were couerted wel,
               of purpoſe they dyd moue:
               The holy one of Iſrael,
               hys power for to proue.
               Not thinking of his hand & power,
               nor of the day when he,
               Deliuered them out of bondage,
               of the enemie.
               Nor how he wrought his miricles
               as they them ſelues behelde,
               In Egipt and the wonders that,
               he did in zoan fielde.
               Nor how he turned by his power,
               their waters into bloude:
               that no man might receyue his drink
               at riuer ne at floude.
               Nor how he ſent them flies & lyce,
               which did vpon them cral,
               And filled the countrey ful of frogges
               to trouble them withal.
               
                  Nor how he did cōmit their fruites
               vnto the Caterpiller:
               And al the labours of their handes,
               he gaue to the graſſehopper.
               With haile ſtones he deſtroyed theyr vynes
               ſo that they were al loſt:
               And alſo their Mulbery trees,
               he did conſume with froſt.
               And yet with hailſtones ones again
               the Lord their cattel ſmote:
               And al their flocks & herdes likewiſe
               with thunder boltes ful hote.
               He caſt vpon them in his yre
               and in his fury ſtronge:
               Diſpleaſure, wrath and angels yl,
               to trouble them amonge.
               Then to his wrath he made a way,
               and ſpared not the leaſt:
               But gaue vnto them peſtilence,
               the man and eke the beaſt
               He ſtrake alſo the fyrſt borne al.
               that vp in Egipt came:
               And al that they had laboured for,
               
                  within the tentes of Ham.
               But for al his owne dere folke,
               he did preſerue and kepe,
               And caried thē through wildernes
               euen like a flocke of ſhepe.
               without al feare both ſafe & ſounde,
               he brought them out of thral:
               Whereas their foes with rage of ſea,
               were ouerwhelmed al.
               and brought theim into the borders
               of his holy lande:
               Euen to the mount which he had purchaſed
               with his right hand.
               And there caſt out the heathen folk
               and did their land deuide:
               And in their tentes he ſet the tribes,
               of Iſrael to abide.
               yet for al thys their god moſt high,
               they ſtyrred and tempted ſtil,
               And would not kepe his teſtament,
               nor yet obey his wil.
               But as their fathers turned backe,
               euen ſo thei went aſtray:
               
                  Much like a bow that would not bēde
               but breake and ſtart away.
               And greeued him wt their hil altars,
               their lightes and with their fire,
               And with their ydols vehemently,
               prouoked him to ire.
               therwith his wrath began againe
               to kinde in his breſt:
               The noughtineſſe of Iſrael,
               he did ſo much deteſt.
               Then he forſake the tabernacle,
               of Silo where he was
               Right conuerſant with earthly men,
               euen as his dwellinge place.
               then ſuffred he their might & power,
               in bondage for to ſtande,
               And gaue the beautie of his folke,
               into their enemies hande.
               And did commit them to the ſword
               wrath with his heritage:
               th
                     •
                   yōge men wer deuoured with fier
               maides had no mariage.
               and with the ſword the prieſtes alſo
               
                  did periſhe euerychone:
               And not a widowe left a liue,
               theyr faulte for to bemone.
               And then the Lord began to wake
               like one that ſlepte a tyme,
               Or like a ſouldiour that had been,
               refreſhed wel with wyne.
               with emerauldes in the hinder partes
               he ſtrake his enemies al:
               And put them then vnto a ſhame,
               that was perpetual.
               Then he the tent and tabernacle,
               of Ioſeph did refuſe,
               As for the tribe of Ephraim
               he would in no wiſe chuſe,
               But choſe the tribe of Iuda
               where as he thought to dwel,
               Euen the mount of Syon,
               which he did loue ſo wel.
               Whereas he did his temple buylde,
               both ſumpteouſlye and ſure:
               Like to the groūd which he had made
               for euer to endure.
               
                  Then choſe he Dauid him to ſerue
               hys people for to kepe:
               Which he toke vp and brought away
               euen from the foldes of ſhepe.
               As he did folow the ewes with yong
               the Lord did hym auaunce:
               To fede his people of Iſrael,
               and his enheritaunce.
               Then Dauid with a faithful hart
               hys flocke and charge did feede:
               And prudently with al his power,
               did gouerne them in dede.
            
            
               Benedic anima mea. Pſalm. lxxiiii.
               
                  To god for all his benefites.
                  we render thankes eche one:
                  Who knoweth the frayletie of vs all,
                  and helpeth vs alone.

               my ſpirite ſhal do the ſame:
               And al the ſecretes of my harte

                  geue thanks to god for al his giftes
               ſhew not your ſelf vnkinde:
               And ſuffer not his benefites,
               to ſlippe out thy minde.
               That gaue the pardon for thy ſyn,
               and thee reſtored againe:
               For al thy weake and frayle diſeaſe,
               and healed thee of thy paine.
               that did redeme thy life from death,
               from which thou couldeſt not flee,
               His mercy and compaſſion both,
               he did extende to thee.
               that filled with goodnes thy deſyre,
               and did prolonge thy youth:
               Like as the Eagle caſteth her byl,
               wherby her age reneweth.
               the Lord with iuſtice doth reuenge
               al ſuch as be oppreſt,
               The pacience of the perfect man,
               is tourned to the beſt.
               His waies & his cōmaundemētes
               to Moyſes he did ſhowe,
               His counſels eke with his conſentes,
               
                  the Iſraelytes do knowe.
               the Lord is kynd and mercyful,
               when ſynners do hym greue,
               The ſloweſt to conceyue a wrath,
               and redyeſt to forgeue.
               He chydeth not vs continually,
               though we be ful of ſtrife:
               Nor kepe our faultes in memorie,
               for al our ſynneful lyfe.
               Nor yet according to our ſynnes,
               the Lord doth vs regarde,
               Nor ofter our iniquities,
               he doth vs not rewarde.
               But as the ſpace is wōderous great
               twixt earth and heauen aboue,
               So is his goodnes much more large,
               to them that doo hym loue,
               He doth remoue our ſynnes from vs
               and our offences al:
               As farre as is the Sunne ryſyng,
               ful diſtaunce from hys fal.
               And loke what pitie parentes dere

                  Lyke pitie beareth the Lord to ſuche,
               as worſhip hym in feare.
               The lord that made vs knoweth our ſhape
               our moulde and faſhion iuſt:
               How weake and fraile our nature is,
               and how we be but duſt.
               And how the tyme of mortal men,
               is lyke the witheryng haye.
               Or lyke the floure ryght fayre in field
               that fadeth ful ſoone awaye.
               Whoſe gloſſe and beautye ſtormye wyndes

               And in reproche of thee withal
               Crie out with one accorde.
               behold the mā which would not take
               the lord for his defence:
               But of his goods his god did make,
               And truſt his owne pretence.
               But I an Oliue freſh and grene
               Shal ſping and ſpreade abrode:
               For why my truſt al times hath been,
               Vpon the liuing god.
               For therfore wil I geue prayſe,
               To him with hart and voyce:
               
                  I wil ſet forth his name alwayes,
               where in his ſainctes reioyce.

                  The wicked men inuent.
                  Agaynſt gods church which ſheweth her faults
                  And doth to hym lament.
               
               
                  O Lord the Gentils do inuade,
               Thine heritage to ſpoyle:
               Hieruſalem an heape is made,
               Thy temple they defoyle.
               the bodies of thy ſainctes moſt dere
               Abrode to birdes they caſt:
               The fleſh of ſuch as do thee feare,
               They beaſtes deuour and waſt.
               their bloud throughout Ieruſalem,
               As water ſpilte they haue:
               So that there is not one of them,
               To lay their dead in graue.
               Thus are we made a laughing ſtocke
               Almoſt the world throughout:

               wilt thou O Lord thus in thine yre,
               Againſt vs euer fume?
               And ſhew thy wrath as hote as fyre,
               Thy folke for to conſume?
               Vpon thoſe people powre the ſame.
               which did thee neuer knowe.
               Al ſuch as cal not on thy name
               Conſume and ouerthrowe.
               For thei haue got the vpper hande,
               And Iacobs ſede deſtroyed,
               His habitacion and his lande,
               By them is ſore annoyed.
               Beare not in mind our former faultes
               With ſpede ſome pitie ſhow
               And ayde vs lord in al aſſaultes,
               For we are weake and lowe.
               O god that geueſt health and grace,
               On vs declare the ſame:
               way not our works our ſinnes deface
               For honour of thy name.
               why ſhal the wicked ſtil alwaye,
               
                  To vs ss people dumme:

               Where is their god become?
               Requier O lorde as thou ſeeſt good,
               Before our eyes in ſight:

               Receiue into thy ſight in haſte,
               The clamours griefe and wronge:
               Of ſuch as are in priſon caſt,
               Suſtaining yrons ſtronge.
               Thy force and ſtrength to celebrat
               Lord ſet them out of bande▪
               
               which vnto death are deſtinate,
               And in their enemies hande.
               The nacions which haue ben ſo bold
               As to blaſpheme thy name:
               Into their lappes with ſeuen folde,
               Repay againe the ſame.
               So we thy folke thy paſture ſhepe,
               wil praiſe thee euermore.
               And teach al ages for to kepe
               For thee like praiſe in ſtore.

               Of poore men in their righte:
               And ridde the nedie from the clawes,
               Of tyrauntes force and might.
               but nothing wil thei knowe or lerne
               
                  in vaine to theym I talke,
               Thei wil not ſee or ought diſcerne,
               But ſtil in darkenes walke.
               wherefore be ſure the time wil come
               Sence ye ſuch waies do take:

               I had decreed it in my ſight,
               As goddes to take you al,
               And children to the moſt of might,
               For loue I dyd you call.
               But not withſtanding ye ſhal dye,

               And iudge the worlde with might:
               For all nacions are thyne owne,

               truſt not in worldlye princes then,
               Though thei abounde in wealth,
               Nor in the ſonnes of mortal men,
               in whome there is no health.
               For why their breth doth ſone depart,
               To earth anone they fal:

               But on the Lorde is ſtayed.
               which made the earth & waters depe,
               The heauens high withal:
               which doth his word & promiſe kepe.

               The lame to limmes reſtore:
               The lord I ſay doth loue the right,
               And iuſt man euermore.

               The ſtraunger ſad in harte:
               And quite the widow from diſtres,
