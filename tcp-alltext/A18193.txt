            Wiliam Cicill hauing taken muche profit by ye reading of this treatyse folowing, wisheth vnto euery christian by ye reading therof like profit with increase from god.
            
               MOste gentle & Christian reader, yf matiers shoulde be rather confirmed by their reporters, than the reportes, warraunted by the maters, I might iustely bewayle our tyme wherin euil deades be well woorded, and good actes euill cleped. But synce truthe is, ye thinges be not good for their prayses, but be praysed for their goodnes, I doe not moue the to lyke this christian treatise, bycause I haue mynde to prayse it, but I exhorte the to mynde it, & for the goodnes, thou shalt allowe

it, for whose likinge I labour not to obteyne, only moued by my example, their iudgement I regarde chieflye confirmed by by the matier. Truely our tyme is so disposed, to graunte good names to euill fruites, and excellente termes to meane workes, that neyther can good dedes enioye their due names being defrauded by the euill, neyther excellente workes can possesse their worthy termes beinge forstalled by the meane. In so muche that men seeke rather, howe muche they can, then howe muche they ought to saye: inclininge more to their pleasure, thē to theyr iudgement, and to shewe them selues rather elo
                  •
               uent, then the matier good: so that neyther the goodnes of the cause can moue them

to saye more, neyther the euilnes lesse. For if the excellencye of this christian contemplacion eyther for ye goodnes herin to maruaill, appering eyther for the proffyt herupon to the reader ensewinge shoulde be with due commendacion folowed, I of necessitie shoulde eyther trauayle to fynde oute newe wordes, the olde being anticipated by euill matiers, or wishe that the commen speache of praysing were spared vntill conuenient maters were founde to spende it: suche is the plentye of praysing, and scarcenes of deseruing. Wherfore lackinge the manner in woordes, and not the matier in deade of high commē
               dacion, I am compelled, to kepe in my iudgemente with sylence, trusting whō my reaport coulde

not haue moued to lyke thys present treatise, the worthines of the matier shal compell to geue it honour. Any earthely manne woulde sone be stirred to see some mistery of magike, or practise of alchumye, or perchaunce some enchauntemente of Elementes: But thou whiche art christened, hast here a wonderful mistery of the mercy of god, a heuenly practise of regeneracion, a spirituall Enchauntement of the grace of god. Yf Ioye and tryumphes be shewed when a kinges childe is borne to the worlde, what Ioye is sufficient, when goddes childe is regenerated from heauen.
            Thone is fleshe whiche is borne of fleshe: The other is spirite, whiche is borne of Spirit. The one also shall wither like ye grasse

of the yearth in shorte tyme, the other shal lyue in heauen beyond al time. Yf the finding of one lost shepe, be more ioyfull, then the hauing of ninetie and nyne, what Ioye is it to consyder the returne of a straye childe of almightye god, whose returne teacheth the nyentie and nine to come to their folde? Euen suche cause of Ioye is this, that the Aungells in heauen take comforte herin: be thou therfore ioyfull where a noble childe is newlie borne: shewe thy selfe gladde where the lost shepe hathe wunne the hole flocke: be thou not sad, wherin Aungelles reioyce. Here mayst thou see one, if the kinde maye moue the a woman, if degre may prouoke the a woman of highe estate, by birthe made noble, by mariage most noble,

by wisdome godly, by a mighty king, an excellent Quene, by a famous Henry, a renoumed Katheryne, a wife to hym that was a kinge to realmes: refusinge the worlde wherin she was loste, to obteyne heauen wherin she maye be saued: abhorringe synne, whiche made her bounde, to receyue grace, wherby she may be fre: dispising fleshe the cause of corrupcion, to put on the spirite, ye cause of sanctificacion: forsaking ignoraunce wherin she was blind, to come to knowledge, wherby she may se: remouing supersticion, wherwith she was smothered, to enbrace trew Religion, wherwith she may reuiue. The fruit of thys treatise (good Reader) is thye amendment: this only had, the writer is satisfied. This good

lady thought no shame to detect her sinne, to obteyne remissiō: no vilenes, to become nothing, to be a mēbre of hī, which is al thinges is all: no folye to forget the wisdome of the worlde, to lerne the Simplicitie of the gospel: at the last, no displeasauntnes to submyt her selfe to the scole of the Crosse, the learning of the crucifixe, the booke of our redēpciō, ye very obsolute library of goddes mercye and wisdome. Thys way thought she her honour encreased, and her state permanente, to make her yearthlye honour heauenly, and neglect the transitorye for the euerlastynge. Of this I woulde the warned that ye profit may ensewe. These greate misteries, and graces be not well perceyued, except they be suerly

studied, neyther be they perfectly studied, except they be diligently practised: neither profitablye practysed, without amendement. Se & lerne hereby what she hath doone, then mayst thou practise, and amend that thou canst do: so shalt thou practise with ease hauing a guyde, & amende wt profit, hauing a zeale. It is easyer to see these, then to learne: begynne at the easyest to come to the harder: see thou her confession, that thou maist lerne her repētaunce: practyse her perseueraunce, that thou mayst haue lyke amendemente: displease thy selfe, in eschewing vice, that thou mayste please god in askynge grace: let not shame hinder thy confessiō, whiche hindred not the offence: be

thou sure yf we knowledge our sinnes, god is faythful to forgiue vs, and to clense vs from all vnryghteousnes: obey ye prophetes saying: declare thy wayes to the lord. Thus far thou maist learne to knowe thy selfe: next this be thou as diligent to releiue thye selfe in goddes mercy, as thou hast bē to reuele thy selfe in thine owne repentaunce. For god hath cōcluded al thinges vnder sinne, because he woulde haue mercy vpon al, who hath also borne our sinnes in his body, vpon the tre, yt we shoulde be delyuered from sinne, & shoulde lyue vnto rightwisnes, by whose stripe we be healed: here is oure anker, here is our shepeherd, here we be made hole, here is our life, our redempcion,

our saluacion, and our blisse: let vs therfore nowe fede by thys gracious quenes example, and be not ashamed to become in confession publicanes, since thys noble lady wil be no Pharesie. And to all ladies of estate I wishe as ernest minde to folow our quene in vertue, as in honour: that they might once appere to prefer god before the worlde: and be honorable in religion, whiche nowe be honorable in vanyties: so shall they (as in some vertuouse ladies of right high estate it is with greate comforte seene) taste of this fredome of remission of this euerlastyng blisse, whiche excedeth all thoughtes and vnderstandinges, and is prepared for the holie in spirite, for the which let vs with our intercessiō in holynes

and purenes of lyfe, offer our selfes to the heauenly father an vndefiled host: to whom be eternall prayse and glorye through all the yearth, without ende. Amen.

Who is he that is not forced to confesse the same, if he consyder what he hath receyued of god, and dothe dayly receyue? Yea if men woulde not acknowledge, & confesse the same,Lu. xix. the stones would crie it out.

I forsooke him, in whom is all truth, & folowed the vayne folishe imaginacions of my hert. I would haue couered my sinnes with the pretence of holynes, I called supersticion, godly meaning, and true holynes, erroure, The lord did speake many pleasant and swete wordes vnto me,

Was it not a merueylous vnkyndnes when god dyd speake to me, and also call me, that I woulde not answer him? what man so called, woulde not heaue harde? or what man hearyng, woulde not haue answered? Yf an earthlye Prince had spoken, eyther called him, I suppose there be none but would willingly haue done bothe. Now therfore what a wretche & Caytife am I? that when the Prince

For then I beganne (and not before) to perceyue and see myne owne Ignoraunce and blindnes: the cause therof was, that I woulde not learne to knowe Christ, my Sauiour and redemer.

And euen as the faythfull are forced to allowe true fayth, so the vnfaythful can in no wise probably intrete therof: ye one feling in him selfe that he sayth, the other hauing not in him for to say.

but a simple zele, and earnest loue to the truth, inspired of god, who promiseth to powre his spirite vpō all flesshe: which I haue by the grace of god (whō I moste humblie honour) felt in my selfe to be true. Let vs therfore nowe I pray you, by fayth, beholde & considre the greate charitie, and goodnes of god, in sending hys Sonne to suffer death for our redemcion, when we were his mortal enemies, and after what sort & maner he sent him. First it is to be considered,How god sent his son. yea, to be vndoubtedly wt a perfect fayth beleued, that god sent him to vs freely, for he dyd geue him, and solde him not. A more noble and ryche gift,Iohn. iii. he coulde not haue geuen. He sente not a seruaunte, or a frende, but

his only Sonne, so deerlye beloued: not in delytes, riches, and honours, but in crosses, poouerties, & slaunders: not as a lorde, but as a seruaunt. Yea,Philip. ii. & in most vyle, and paynfull passions, to wassh vs, not with water,i. Iohn. i. but wt his owne precious bloud: not frō myer, but from the puddle and fylthe of our iniquities. He hath geuē him, not to make vs poore, but to enryche vs with his diuine vertues, merites,Roma. viii. and graces, yea and in hym, he hath geuen vs all good thynges, and fynally hym selfe: and that with suche greate charitie as can not be expressed. Was it not a moste high, and aboundaunt charitie of GOD, to sende Christe to shead his bloud, to loose honour,The charitie of GOD toward man. lyfe, and all, for hys ennemyes?

Euen in the tyme when we had doen him moste iniurie,Rom. v. he first shewed his charitie to vs, with such flambes of loue, that greater coulde not be shewed.

As for an example: When a prince fyghting wt his ennemyes,A similitude. which sōtime had ye soueraintie ouer his people, & subdewing thē, may kil them yf he will, yet he preserueth

and saueth theym: And wheras they were lordes ouer his people: he maketh theym after to serue, whom they before had rewled.
            Nowe in suche a case, the prince doth shewe hym selfe a greater conquerour, in that he hath made theym whiche were rewlers to obey: & the subiectes to be lordes ouer them, to whom they serued, then yf he had vtterly distroyed theim vpon the conquest. For nowe he leaueth continuall victory to theym, whom he redeamed, wheras otherwise thoccasion of victory, was taken away, where none were left to be the subiectes. Euen so in lyke case, Christe hath left in vs these concupiscences,Applicacion of the similitude. to thintente they should serue vs, to the exercise of our vertues, where first they did

reigne ouer vs, to thexercice of oure sinne. And it may be plainly sene, that wheras first they were suche impedimentes to vs, yt we coulde not moue our selues towardes god, nowe by Christ we haue so muche strength, that not withstanding the force of theym, we may assuredly walke to heauen. And although the chyldren of god sūtime doo falle by frailtie, into sum sinne, yet that falling maketh them to humble thē selues, and to reknowelege the goodnes of god, and to cum to hym for refuge and helpe.Uictory ouer the deuell. Lykewise Christ with hys death, hath ouercum the prince of deuilles with all hys hoste,Collo. ii. and hath distroyed them all. For as Paule sayeth, this is verefied yt Christe should breake ye serpentes heade,Genue. iii.
               
prophesied by GOD. And although the deuil tempte vs, yet if by fayth we be planted in Christ, we shall not perish: but rather by his temptacion, take greate force and might. So it is euident, that the triumph, victory and glory of Christe, is the greater, hauing in suche sorte subdewed the deuyll, that wheras he was prince and lorde of the worlde, holding all creatures in captiuitie, nowe Christe vseth him as an Instrument to punish the wicked, & to exercise & make strong the electe of god, in christian warre fare.
            Christe likewise hath ouercum death in a more glorious manner,Uictory oue

                   death. (yf it be possible) because he hath not takē it away, but leuing vniuersally al subiect to the same. He hath geuen so muche vertue,

and spirite, that wheras afore we passed therto with great feare, nowe we be bolde through the spirite, for the sure hope of resurrecciō, that we receyue it wt Ioie. It is nowe no more bitter, but swete: no more feared, but desired: It is no death, but life. And also it hath pleased god that the infirmities and aduersities doo remayne to the sight of the world: but the children of God are by Christ made so strong,Phil. iiii. ii. Cor. i. rightwise, whole, and sounde, that the troubles of the worlde, be comfortes of the spirite: The passions of the fleshe,All thinges proffit the chosen. are medicines of the soule. For al maner thinges worketh to their commoditie and profite: for they in spirite feele,Roma. viii. that god, their father, doth gouerne theym, and disposeth all thinges for their benefite:

therfore they feele theym selues sure. In persecucion, they are quiet, and peacefull: in tyme of trouble, they ar without werynes, feares, anxcieties, suspicions, miseries: and finally all the good, and euil of the world, worketh to their commoditie. Moreouer they see that the triumph of Christ hath ben so great, that not only he hath subdewed and vanquished all our enemies, and the power of theym, but he hath ouerthrowne & vanquished them, after suche a sorte, that al thinges serue to our helth: he might, and coulde haue taken theym all away, but where then should haue bē our victorye, palme, & crowne? For wee dayly haue fightes, in the flesshe, and by the succour of grace, haue continuall victories,

ouer sinne, wherby we haue cause to glorifie god, that by his sonne, hath weakened our enemy the deuil: and by hys spiryte, geuith vs strength to vanquishe hys ofspringes. So doe we knowelege daylie the great tryumphe of our Sauiour, & reioyce in our owne fightes, the which we can no wise impute to any wisedome of thys worlde: seing sinne to encrease by it. And where worldlie wisedome most gouerneth, there most sinne ruleth: For as the world is enemy to god, so also the wisedome therof,The wisedō of the world. is aduerse to god. And therfore Christ hath declared & discouered the same for folishnes.i. Cor. ii.iii.

vesselles. For before, wheras it was our ruler against god, nowe by Christe we are serued of it for God, as of a slaue in worldlye thinges. Albeit in supernaturall thinges the same is not to be vnderstand. And further, if any time men would impugne, & gaynsaye vs, wt the wisedome of the world, yet we haue by Christe, so muche supernatural light of the trut

and he hath yelded witnes, that the workes of men, not regenerated by him in fayth, are euel.Iohn. iii. Rom. xiiii. And so Christe hath iudged, and condemned the worlde, for naught. Furthermore he hath geuen to al hys, so muche light, and spirite, that they knowe it,How Christians regarde the worlde. and disprayse the same: yea and treade it vnder their feete, wt al vayne honours, dignities, and pleasures: not taking the fayre promises, neyther the offers, whiche it doth present. Nay, they rather make a scorne of theym. And as for the threatnynges and force of the worlde, they nothing feare.A conclusion of the victories. Nowe therfore we may see howe great the victorye and tryumphe of Christ is, who hathe deliuered all those the father gaue him,Iohn. xvii. frō ye power of the deuill,Collo. ii. cancellynge vpon

the Crosse, the wrytyng of our dertes: For he hath delyuered vs, frō the condemnacion of sinne, from the bondage of the lawe, from the feare of death, from the daungier of the world, and from all euylles: in this life, and in thother to cum. And he hath enriched vs, made vs noble, & most highlie happie, after suche a glorious, and tryumphant waye, as can not wt tongue, be expressed. And therfore we are forced to say his triūphe is merueylous.Christ is Messias.
            
            It is also sene & knowen, ye Christ is the true Messias, for he hath delyuered man from all euylles, and by hym, man hath all goodnes: so that he is the true Messias. Therfore al other helpers be but vaine, and counterfeyted Sauiours, seing that by this oure Messias, Christ, wholie and onely, we be delyuered

from all euylles: and by hym, we haue all goodnes. And that this is true, it is euidente and cleare, because the very true christian, is a christian by Christ. And the true christian fealeth inwardly by Christe, so muche goodnes of god, that euen troublouse lyfe and death be swete vnto hym,ii. Cor. iiii. and miseries happie: the true christian by Christe,Ro. vii. is disburdened frō the seruitude of the lawe, hauing the law of grace (grauen by the spirite) inhabiting his hart, and from sinne, that reygned in him, from the power of the infernal spirites, from dā
               nacion, and from euery euyll: And is made a sonne of God,The title of a christian. a brother of Christ, heyre of heauen, and lord of the worlde. So that in Christe, and by Christ,Rom. viii. he possesseth al good thynges. But let vs knowe, that

Christ yet fighteth in spirite, in his elect vesselles, and shall fight euen to the daye of iudgemēt. At which daye, shal that great enemy death, be wholie distroyed, and shalbe no more. Then shall the children of god reioyce on him, saying: O death where is thy victory & sting?Osee. xiii. There shalbe thē no more trouble, nor sinne, naye, rather none euyll: but heauen for the good, and hell for the wicked. Then shall wholie be discouered the victorie and triumphe of Christ:i.

lamente muche I haue passed so many yeares,A presumtuous trewād not regardyng that diuine booke, but I iudged, and thought my self to be well instructed in the same: whereas nowe, I am of this opinion, that yf God would suffer me to lyue here a .M. yeare, and should studye continually in the same diuine booke,A man is neuer glut with knowledge. I should not be fylled with the contemplacion therof. Neyther holde I my self contented, but alwayes haue a great desier, to learne and study more therin. I neuer knewe myne owne wickednes,The first lesson in the booke. neyther lamented for my synnes truly, vntill the tyme god inspired me with his grace, that I looked in this booke. Then I beganne to see perfectly, that mine owne power and strēgth could not helpe me, & that I was in the Lordes hande, euen as the

There bein the world, many speakers of holines, & good workes, but very rare and and seeldome is declared, which be the good and holy workes.Holy workes. The workes of the spirite be neuer almost spoken of. And therfore very fewe knowe what they be. I am able to iustifie the ignorance of the people to be great,Few know the true holynes. not in this matter alone, but in many other, which were most necessary for christians to know. Bicause I haue had iust profe of ye same, it maketh me thus muche to say with no lytle sorowe and griefe in my harte, for suche a miserable ignoraunce, and blyndnes amongest the people.Math. xii. I doubte not but wee can saye al, Lorde, Lorde: but I feare god may saye

vnto vs, this people honoreth me with their lippes but their hartes be far from me.Mat. xv. God desyreth nothing but the harte, and sayeth he will be worshipped in spirit and truthe. Christ condemned all Hipocrisie and feyned holynes,Io. iiii. and taught sincere, pure, and true godlynes: But we worse thē frantike, or blind, will not folowe Christes doctrine, but trust to mennes doctrines,Tradiciōs of men. iudgementes, and sayinges, which dimineth our eyes: and so the blinde leadeth the blinde,Math. xv. and both fal into the dyche. Trulye in my simple, and vnlearned iudgement, no mannes doctrine is to be estemed or preferred lyke vnto Christes and the Apostles, nor to be taught as a perfect and true doctrine,The worde of god is ye onelye sure doctrine. but euen as it doth accorde and agree with the doctrine

of the gospell. But yet those that he called spiritual pastours, although they be moste carnall, as it doth very euidently & plainlye appere,The cause of thestimacion of tradicions. by their fruites, are so blynded with the loue of them selues, and the worlde, that they extoll mennes inuencions and doctrines, before the doctrine of the gospel. And whē they be not able to maynteyne their owne inuencions, and doctrine with any iote of the scripture, then they most cruellye persecute them that be contrary to ye same. Be suche ye louers of Christ? naye, nay: they be the louers of the wicked Mammō, neither regardyng God nor his honor. For fylthy lucre hath made them almoste mad, but frantyke they be doubteles. Is not this miserable state of spirituall men

in the world, muche to be lamēted of al good christiās? But yet I cā
               not allow, neyther prayse al kynd of lamētacion, but suche as maye stande wt Christiā charitie. Charitie suffereth long, and is gentle, enuyeth not, vpbraydeth no man,i.

I would all christians,A godly wishe. that like as they haue professed Christ, would so endeuoure themselues to folowe him, in godly lyuing. For we haue not put on Christ to liue anye more to oure selues,Ephe. iiii. in the vanities, delites, and pleasures of the worlde, and the flesshe,

They flatter not themselues, with thinkyng euery thing whiche shyneth to the worlde,Worldes loue. to be good and holye, for they knowe all externe & outward workes be they neuer so

glorious & fayre to ye world, may be doen of the euill, aswell as of the good: and therfore they haue in very litle estimacion, the outewarde shewe of holynes, because they be all spirituall, castyng vp their eyes vpon heauēly thinges: neyther lokyng nor regardynge the earthly thinges, for they be to them vyle, and abiect. They haue also the simplicitie of the doue,Simple wisdō in men. & the policie of the Serpent: for by simplicitie, they haue a desire to do good to all men,Mat. x. and to hurte no man, no though they haue occasion geuen. And by policie they gyue not, nor minister anye iuste cause to anye man, whereby their doctrine might be reproued.
            They be not also as a reede shaken with euery wynde,Christen constātues. Math. xi. when they be blasted with the tempestes, &

for my chosen: Euen so the perfect men are neuer offended at anye thyng. For although the worlde were full of sinne, they would not withdrawe themselues from doing of good, nor waxe colde in the loue of the lorde. And muche lesse they would be moued to be euyll: yea rather they be so muche the more moued to do good. The regenerated by Christ,The workes of god offende not the christiā. are neuer offended at the workes of god, because they knowe by faythe, that God doeth all thinges well. And that he can not erre neyther for want of power, nor by ygnoraūce nor malice: for they knowe hym to be almightie,Heb. iiii. and that he seeth all thynges, and is moste habundauntlye good: they see and feele in spirite, that of that wyll, moste highl

               e perfect, can not but

proceade moste perfecte workes. Likewise they be not offended at the workes of men:The workes of mē offend not the Christian. for if they be good, they are moued by them to take occasion to folowe them, and to reknowledge the goodnes of god, with geuing of thankes, and praising his name, dayly ye more: but yf they be indifferent, & suche as maye be done with good and euill ententes, they iudge the best parte,Mat. vii. thinking they may be doen to a good purpose, and so they be edified: but yf they be so euil, that they canne not be taken in good parte, by anye meanes, yet they be not offended althoughe occasion be geuen, nay rather they be edyfied, in asmuche as they take occasion to be better althoughe the contrary be ministred vnto them.Eph. v. Then begynne they to thinke and

saye thus:The christian profiteth by synne. yf god had not preserued me with his grace, I shoulde haue committed this sinne, and worse. O howe muche am I boūd to cōfesse,Ps. cxlv. and knowlege the goodnes of god. They go also thinking and saying further. He that hath synned, maye be one of gods electe: peraduenture the lord hath suffered him to fall, to the entente he maye the better know himselfe. I knowe he is one of them that Christ hath shead his bloude for, and one of my christen brethren. Truely I wyll admonyshe, and rebuke hym, and in case I fynde him desperate, I wyll comforte hym, and shewe hym the greate goodnes and mercye of God, in Christ: and with godly consolacions I will see, yf I can lifte him vp. And thus ye maye see howe ye
               
men regenerated by Christe, of euery thynge, winne, and receyue fruite.weaklynges mislike al thī
                  ges. And contrarye the younglinges and vnperfect, are offended at small tryfles, takyng euery thing in euyll parte, grudging and murmuryng agaynste their neyghboure: & so muche the more as they shew them selues feruent in their so doyng,Act. xiii. they are iudged of the blynde worlde, and of them selues, great zealebearers to god. Yf this were the greatest euill of these younglinges, it were not the moste euyl: but I feare they be so blynde and ignoraunte, that they are offended also at good thinges: and iudge nothing good but suche as they enbrace & esteme to be good, with murmuringe against al suche, as folow not their wayes. Yf there be any of this

sort,Godly. the lord geue thē light of his truth yt they may encrease & grow in godly strength. I suppose if suche yōglinges & vnperfect, had sene Christ, and his disciples, eate meate wt vnwashed hādes,Mat. xv. or not to haue fasted with ye Phariseis,Mat. ix. they would haue ben offēded, seīg him a breaker of mēnes tradiciōs: their affections dispose their eies to se through other men, & they se nothing in thēselues: where charitie (although it be moste fullest of eyes to see the faultes of others, whome it coueteth to amēde) thinketh none euil,i. Cor. xiii. but discretely and rightly interpreteth all thynges: by ye which more iustly & truly, euery thing is takē. Now these supersticious weaklinges, yf they had ben cōuersaūt with Christ, & seen him leade his liefe sumtime

with wemē, sumtime with Samaritanes, wt Publicanes, sinners, & with the phariseis, they woulde haue murmured at him. Also yf they had sene Mary powre vpon Christ, the preciouse oyntmente, they would haue sayde with Iudas,mat. xxvi. this oyntmente might haue bene solde, and geuē to the poore. Yf they also had sene Christ with whippes driue out of the temple,Mat. xxi. those that bought and sould, they woulde furthwith haue iudged Christ to haue ben troubled and moued with angre, and not by zeale of charitie. How would they haue bene offended,Io. vii. yf they had seen him gooen to the Iewes feast,Mat. xii. heale a syckeman vpon the Saboth daye,Io. iiii. practyse with the woman of Samary, ye and shew vnto her, of his moste diuine doctrine

and life? They woulde haue taken occasion to haue hated and persecuted hym, as the Scribes and Phariseis dyd. And euen so shoulde Christe the Sauioure of the worlde, haue bene to them an offence and ruine.Rom. ix. There be an other kynde of litleones vnperfect, which are offēded after this sorte and maner:A second sorte of weaklynges. as when they see one that is reputed and estemed holy, to commit synne, furthwith they learne to doe that, and worse, and waxe colde in doing of good, and confirme thēselues in euil: & then they excuse their wicked lyfe, publishyng the same, with the sclaū
               der of theyr neyghbor. If eny mā reproue them, they saye: suche a man dyd this, and worse. So it is euident that suche persōs would denye Christe, yf they sawe other

men do the same. If they went to Rome, and saw the enormities of the prelates whiche is sayde to reigne there emonges: I doubte not yf they sawe one of them sinne which were reputed and takē for holy, theyr fayth shoulde be loste, but not the fayth of Christ, which they neuer possessed: but they should lease that humayne opinion, whiche they had of the goodnes of prelates. For yf they had the faythe of Christe, the holye ghoste shoulde be a witnes vnto them,Ephe. i. which should be mighty in them, that in case all the world would denye Christ, they woulde remayne firme & stable in the true faith. The phariseis also, toke occasion of ye euil of others,Phariseis. to waxe hautie & proude, taking thēselues

to be men of greater perfection thē any other, bicause of their vertue, euen as the Pharisei did, whē he sawe the publicanes submission:Lu. xviii. and so they be offended, with euerye litle thinge, iudging euill, murmuring agaynst their neyghbour, and for the same, they are of manye, reputed and taken for the more holy and good: wheras in deade, they be the more wicked.
            The most wicked persons are offended euen at themselues: for at their litle stabilitie in goodnes, and of their detestable and euill lyfe, they take occasion to despayre: Where they oughte the more to commit themselues to god, asking mercye for theyr offences. And furthwith to gyue thankes, yt it hath pleased him of his goodnes, to suffer them so lōg

a tyme.Wicked men mislike good thinges. But what neadeth it any more to saye, the euyll men are offended euē at the workes of god. They see god suffer synners, therfore thinke they, sinne displeaseth him not: And because they se not the good rewarded with riches, oftentymes they imagin, that god loueth them not: it seameth to them god is parciall,Ps. xxxvii because he hath elected sum, and sum reproued.Offēce of Gods election. And therfore they saye, that the elected be sure of saluacion,Rom. ix. Rom. xi. takyng by yt, occasion to do euyl ynough, saying: whatsoeuer god hath determined,Ps. xxxiii. shalbe perfourmed. Yf also they see the good men oppressed, and the euill men exalted, they iudge god vniust, taking occasion to lyue euelly, saying: inasmuche as god fauoureth the naughty men, let vs doe euyll

ynough, to thentent, he dooe vs good. Yf then the wicked be offended euen at god,Roma. iii. it is no wondre yf they be offended at those that folow, & walke in his pathes and wayes. Nowe I will speake with greate dolour,Uayne gospellers. and heuynes in my harte, of a sorte of people, whiche be in the worlde that be called professors of the gospell, & by theyr wordes doe declare and shewe, they be muche affected to the same. But I am afrayed, sum of them do builde vpon the sand, as Simon Magus did,Actes. xiii. making a weake foundacion. I meane, they make not Christe their chiefest foundacion, professing hys doctryne of a sincere, pure, and zelous mynde, but eyther for bycause they woulde be called gospellers to procure sum credit, &

good opinions, of the true and very fauourers of Christes doctrine, eyther to finde out sum carnall libertie,Gal. v. eyther to be contencious disputers, fynders, or rebukers of other mennes fautes, orelles finally to please and flatter the worlde: suche gospellers are an offence,Roma. ii. and a

What charitie? what discrecion? what godlynes? holynes, or puritie of life is amongst thē? Be they not great auēgears, foule glottons, slaunderers, backbyters, aduouterers, fornicatours, swearers, and blasphemers? yea, and wallow, and tumble in al sinnes: These be ye fruites of theyr doctrine.

And thus it may be seene how the worde of GOD is euill spokē of through licencious and euil liuing:Euil lyuing

                it bringeth furth no good fruit: but when it is sowē in good ground, I meane the hartes of good people, it bringeth furthe good fruit aboundantly: so that the want & faute is in men, and not in the worde of

god. I praye god all men & women may haue grace to becum meete tillage for the fruites of the gospell,Prayer. and to leaue onelye the iangling of it: for only speaking of ye gospel,Iohn. i. maketh not men good christians, but good talkers, excepte theyr factes and workes agre with the same: so then theyr speache is good,Math. xii. because theyre hertes be good. And euē as much talke of the worde of God, without practising the same in our lyuing is euill and detestable in the sight of god,Psal. i. so it is a lamentable thing to heare howe there be many in ye worlde, that do not wel digest the reading of scripture,Readyng of the scripture. & doo commende and prayse Ignoraunce, and saye that muche knowlege of gods worde, is the original of al discencion, scismes,

and contencion, and maketh mē hawte, proud and presumptuous by readynge of the same. Thys maner of saying is no lesse than a playne blasphemie agaynst the holy gost.The worde of God. For the spirite of God is the authour of his worde, and so the holy goste is made the authour of euill,Iohn. xvi. whiche is almoste great blasphemie & (as the scripture sayeth) a synne that shal not be forgeuen in this worlde, neyther in the other to cum. It were al our partes and duties,Math. xii. to procure and seeke all the wayes and meanes possible, to haue more knowledge of goddes wordes, set furthe abrode in the worlde, and not allowe Ignoraunce, and discommende knowledge of gods woorde,Knowlege wished against ignoraunce. stopping the mouthes of the vnlearned, with suttle and

               ruite, but a greate perturbacion of the mynde, to the simple & ignoraunt, not knowing whiche way to turne theym. For howe is it not extreame wickednes, to charge the holy sanctified woord of God, with thoffences of man? To allege the scriptures to be perillous learnyng, because certayne readers therof, fall into heresies? These menne might be forced by thys kynde of argumente, to forsake thuse of fyer,Like reason lyke conclusion. because fyer burned theyr neighboures house, or to absteine from meate or drynke, bicause they see many surfeyte.
            O blynde hate, they sklaunder God for mans offence, and excuse the man whom they see offende, &

blame the scripture, whiche they cannot improue: Yea I haue heard of sum that haue very well vnderstande the latin tong, that when they haue hearde learned men,Good latinistes and euil diuines. perswade to the credite and beliefe of certeyne vnwritten verities (as they call theym) whiche be not in scripture expressed, and yet taught as doctryne apostolike, and necessary to be beleued: they haue ben of thys opinion, that the learned menne, haue mo Epistles written by thappostes of Christ,Forged wrytinges. then we haue abrode in the Cannon of tholde and newe Testament, or knowen of any, but only to them of the Clergie. Whiche beliefe I did not a lytle lament in my harte, to heare that any creature should haue suche a blinde ignoraunte opiniō. Some

kinde of simplicitie is to be praysed, but this simplicitie without the veritie, I can neyther prayse nor allowe. And thus it may be seen, howe we that be vnlettered, remayne confused, withoute god of his grace,The vnlerned be taught by grace. lightē our hartes wt a heauenly light, and knowledge of hys wil, for we be geuen of our selues to beleue men better then god. I pray god sende all lerned menne the spirite of god aboundantly, that theyr doctryne may bryng furthe the fruites therof. I suppose there was neuer more nede of good doctryne to be setfurth in the worlde,This age requyreth lernyng. than nowe in thys age:Wordly children. for the carnall children of Adam be so wise in theyr generacion, that if it wer possible, they woulde deceyue the children of light.Mat. xxiiii The worlde loueth hys

The fleshly children of Adam bee so politicke, subtil, craftie, and wise, in theyre kynde, that the electe should be illuded if it were possible: for they are clothed with Christes garment, in vtter apperaunce, with a fayer shewe of all godlines, and holines in theyre wordes, but they haue so shorne, nopped, & turned Christes garmente, & haue so disguysed theym selues, that the children of light, beholdyng theym with a spirituall eye, accounte and toke theym for men whiche haue solde theyre
