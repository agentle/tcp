HEAVENLY TREASVRE
OF CONFORTABLE
MEDITATIONS
AND PRAYERS
WRITTEN BY
S. AVGVSTIN,
BISHOP OF HYPPON
In three ſeuerall treatiſes of his Meditations,
Soliloquies, and Manual.
            
            Faithfully tranſlated into Engliſh by the R.
F. ANTONY BATT Monke, of
the holy order of S BENNET of
the Congregation of England.
            AT S. OMERS,
For IOHN HEIGHAM
Anno 1624.
         
         
            
            
            TO THE MOST ILluſtrious
Lord and our moſt
Reuerend Father in Chriſt
the Lord GABRIEL GIFFORD
de S. Maria Archbiſhoppe,
and Duke of Rhemes,
firſt Peere of Fraunce
&c. our good and gratious
Lord.
            
               THis little booke of the
greatest Doctor of the
Church of God, faithfullye
tranſlated into the
English language for the confort of
our afflicted Catholickes, runneth
of its owne accord into your gratious
patronage: first in regard of the authour,
who hauing beene the tongue
of holy church to preach, diſpute,
and define with power, and efficacie
against the rebellious heretickes,
and ſchiſmatickes of his time, ſeemeth

to exact that his workes should
be dedicated onely to ſuch a patron,
as cometh nearest vnto him in thoſe
ſacred functions; and certainely the
world can witneſſe, that no Bishop
of this age hath ſo powerfully, ſo
learnedly, ſo conſtantlie, am
                  •
               aſt ſo
manie factious inſurrections, before
ſo great, and glorious auditories, in
many of the chiefeſt cittyes of France,
and eſpeciallie in that abridgement
of the world, and Royal ſeat of the
Monarchie of France, Paris, impugned,
and confuted the furious
and fierie hereſies of Caluiniſme,
then your grace hath donne. Whervpon
the moſt Chriſtian King, the
eldest ſonne of the Church, and
glorious Lilly of the Princes of the
world, with manifeſt showe of a
feelinge iudgement of vertue, and
true zeale of Catholicke faith, hath
worthily choſen your grace to be
chiefe Pastour of his Peeres, and
Metropolitan of that holy church

of Rhemes, which as in times paſt
it deſerued to be called, ſo vnder
your graces gouernment, it will ſtill
deſerue to be accompted, the Miſtris
of Eccleſiaſticall diſcipline in
France.
            Secondly in regard of the Tranſlator,
who being a poore monke, and
vnworthy member of that litle monasterie
of S. Laurence in Dieulewart,
in which your Lordship receiued
the habit of S. Bennet, and exerciſed,
with not able humilitie al the
duties of an humble, and an obſeruāt
religious, and afterwards al the parts
of an exemplar, and prouident ſuperiour,
could not perſuade himſelfe
to ſeeke abroade any other patron of
his poore labours, hauing one ſo excellent
at home, whoſe glory; & greatnes
might ennoble, and beautifie the
worke, which the Tranſlatours rude
and vnpolished language could not ſo
perfectly expreſſe to the reader, as the
worth thereof doth deſerue.
            
               
And though ſo ſmall a labour may
ſeeme a very vnproportionable guift
to be offered to ſoe Illuſtrious a Prelat,
yet the offerours ability stretchinge to
noe greater a preſent, will in your
graces courteous acceptance, ſupply
that want of proportion, eſpecially
ſince he had a kinde of neceſsitie impoſed
vpon him by dutifull affection,
and by commaund of obedience to testifie
by this little endeauour the common
ioy, and gladneſſe of al his brethren
the English Benedictins in this
your Lordships ſo wonderfull, though
worthily deſerued promotion. Perhaps
it will be counted a ſleight obſeruation,
yet may it be pardonned me, if in
demonstration of ioy, I poure forth
what my affection biddeth me, though
in exacter iudgement I should haue
concealed it, that the order of S. Bennet
gaue the first Bishop, and first English
Bishop vnto our nation before
euer it had any; and now againe hath
giueu the first conſecrated English

Bishop, that the nation hath had after
ſo long an interruption, as hereſie
hath made in that dignitie. For in the
beginning of our conuerſion from Paganiſme
to Chriſtianiſme, and for many
ages after, ſcarſe had England any
Bishop, that was not a Benedictin:
that being a prerogatiue willinglie
granted by the whole nation vnto the
order which first planted, and watered,
and cultiuated the true faith of
our Sauiour Christ amongſt them, &
continued in thoſe glorious labours,
neuergiuing them ouer by interruptiō,
as a late authour would haue it beleiued,
contrarie to the truth of hiſtorie
which it ſeemes he did not well examine;
for euen in the moſt troubleſome
times of the church of England
both of ancient, and later memory, the
monkes of S. Bennet haue showed
themſelues most zealous in defence of
the faithe, and therfore balling Iohn
Bale, no great friend of Priests not r

England, rayleth at a learned Benedictin

and eloquent unpugner of W

                  •
               n
Oxford: and a better author, as being
a worthy Confeſſor M. D. Pitz in a
booke of the ſame title, numbreth a copious
catalogue of learned preachers,
and writers of the ſame order, who
ſucceſsiuely from age to age, emploied
their endeuours to deſend, & illuſtrate
the faith, which their firſt Fathers had
brought into England: and he might
haue learned out of M. D. Sanders no
ſmall number of Abbots, & Monks of
the order to haue ſtood for the ſame
with loſſe of their liues: and himſelfe
might haue remēbred the famous, and
Reuerēd Abbot Fecknam ſo much toſſed,
& torinoyled in the late Q. Elizabeths
daies, for his conſtancy in retaining
of his faith, & refuſal of the oth
of Suprem. againſt which he writ, and
in which constancie he gloriouſly died
in priſon: whoſe Chaplain, and fellow
monke D. Sebert Buckley, not manie

yeares after the death of his
Lord, receiued from beyond ſeas, a
fresh ſupply of Monasticall Benedictin
preachers, ſent to continue their
auncient miſsion by authoritie of the
ſea Apostolicke from the Popes of glorious
memory Clement the eight, &
Paule the fift, as appeareth by the
motus proprius of the holy Father
Paule the fift, dated the 24. of Decemb.
1612. Pont. ſuian. 8. And we
may put your grace for a witneſſe
though domesticall, yet now, as being
a Bishop, vnpartiall, who haue
knowen many Confeſſors of the order,
and can reſtifie of one eſpecially,
who though blind in body, yet cleare
ſighted in mind, in the church of
Weſt-minster publickly, and ſtoutely
confuted in an after-noone ſermon,
aprecedent railing ſermon which D.
Horne by appointment of the Councel
ſounded in the eares of the people,
to diſgrace the profeſsion of
Monkes, and Catholique Religion.

So that there neuer hath bene any interruption
of Benedictin preachets,
and teachers in England, and we truſt
neuer wilbe till the worlds end; of
which confidence of ours we esteeme
a very probable argument, the memorie
and loue vnto the order of S. Bennet,
ſo deepely ingrafted in the harts
of English men, that no emulation by
neuer ſo extraordinarie diligence can
roote it out; and we thinke no ſmall
coniecture therof may be taken from
this admirable promotion of your
Lordship, of which we may ſay what
Mardocheus ſaid vnto Hester: Et quis
nouit vtrum idcirco ad regnumveneris,
vt in tali tempore parareris?
Who can tell but that your grace is
therfore by Gods prouidence raiſed to
this Eccleſiasticall Kingdome, that in
theſe times you might be ready to erect,
and fortiſie your brethren the
Benedictins, as a man gratious with
both Monarchs, with the Lily of Frā
               ce,
for your fruitfull labours in the

ſoules of his ſubiects, with the Lion
of England, for your acknowledged
faith, and loyaltie to his perſonall
right, and ſucceſsion.
            But enough of the cauſes of dedication:
a word or two by your graces
leaue of the reaſons, why this worke
is tranſlated. Taking delight in reading
of thoſe heauenly conceipts of S.
Augustin, I purpoſed for the priuate
intertainemēt of that time, which obedience
left vnto my choice, to put them
into English as carefully as I could,
and then exhibiting my labour to my
ſuperiours, as an account how I ſpent
my leaſure, they thought good to publishe
it, although it had before bene
tranſlated, which I neuer knew; for
the tranſlator M. Rogers, insteed of
giuing the deuout reader the true
works of S. Augustin, tooke vpon him
preſumptuouſly to mangle, and maime
them in all ſuch places, as the holy
Doctor had writte directly contrary
to Protestanticall doctrine, forcing

him to ſpeake like an hereticke in all
points, of prayer vnto Saints, merits of
good workes, ſuffrages for the faithful
departed, & ſuch other, as ordinarily
do occurre in ſpirituall exerciſes:
in which S. Augustin most plainely,
and clearelye ſpeaking as a true Romain
catholike, this ſaucie controller
M. Rogers, either peruerteth his wordes
to Puritaniſme, or els leaueth them
out, euen whole chapters, as if he were
more illuminated with the grace of
God, and knowledge of truth, then
that glorious Doctor, eſteemed, euen
by our aduerſaries, the learnedst maister,
that euer the Church had ſince
the Apoſtles. And where S. Auguſtin,
in the feruour of his deuotion, with
moſt eloquent, and wary tearmes, repreſenteth
vnto his ſoule, and the
readers thoughts, the dolefull ſpectacle
of our Sauiours paſsion this impious
hereticke leaueth all that out,
or els wickedlie transformeth it,
cenſuring it as eſcapes, and ouerſights,

when it is most euident that
they were written by Saint Augustin
with full aduertiſement of a
farre deeper, and carefuller iudgement,
then euer can be in the braymes
of an hereticke. In one thinge
yet is the man to be commended, that
he doth not this by stelth, and ſilently,
as most of that faction doe,
but openly, and plainely profeſsing
his fact in his prefaces, and yeelding
particular accompt thereof; but no
other reaſon ſauing the credit of his
hereſie. But most abominablie in
the first preface doth he belie the
English Catholickes at home, impoſing
vpon them their tranſlating,
and printinge of diuers lewed legends
of knights errants, as Amadis,
Palmerin, and the like, as if they had
beene published by crafty papists, as
he calls them, to peruert Proteſtants,
whom they could not cōſute with diſputations:
wheras the world knowes,
the tranſlators of thoſe books to haue

bene profeſſed Protestants, and ſome
of them Pourſuiuants, and damnable
Apostata's, as Antony Monday, and
the like, sworne officers, and helhoundes
to hunt out poore afflicted Catholicks
& bring them to the miſeries of
impriſonments, and premuniries. And
both Rogers, and Aſcam his authour
whom he cites, were not of ſo little
reading, but in their conſcience they
knew, that all ſuch bookes are forbidden
very ſtrictly to be read in the Catholicke
church by any of her faithfull
children, and condemned by the rules
of the expurgatorie Index, appointed
by order of the great Councell of
Trent, and drawne out by most indicious,
and godly diuines to direct Catholickes
how to auoid the venini, and
poyſon of all pernicious books, which
Index, it is a wonder how theſe men
dare preſume to find fault with, becauſe
it blotteth out many vnprobable
words, and doctrines in late Authors,
where as they preſume, by their owne

confeſsion, to blott out all words, and
doctrines contrarie to their falſe beliefe,
euen in the very ancient, and greatest
Doctors of the Church; whoſe
writinges that index, for the reuerence
due vnto them, euen in thoſe poincts
wherin, as men, ſome of them haue
miſſed, hath left vntouched, and vncō
               trolled.
All which I haue preſumed to
ſay in this ſpeech vnto your Lordship,
for the better instruction of all
Catholicke readers, who in reading
this preface, I doubt not but will reioyce
with me, & glorifie God for the
great honour, and bleſsings both temporall,
and ſpirituall powred forth
abondantly vpon your grace, notwithſtanding
the reſistance made by
enuie, and emulation; and that in your
bannishment in a strange countrey;
though indeed France is not a strange
countrey vnto the Giffords, whoſe
noble family hath its originall ſtock,
and florisheth yet at this day in little
Britanie, and other parts of France,

and from thence ſent forth its branches
into the greater Britany, with
ſuch proſperous ſucceſſe, that it gaue
to England the Dukes of Buckingam,
and remaineth as yet a principall
branch of that houſe; ſo that it may
ſeeme France hath made estimation of
your grace, not onely prouoked thervnto
by your learning, and vertues,
but euen by the ſecret instinct of nature,
gladly embracing the good which
ſprung first from its owne ſoyle.
            I haue added certaine verſes, and
a deuout conſideration of Bleſſed S.
Peter Damian Cardinall of Ostia, &
monke of our order, a man in thoſe
dayes ſo profitablie, and feruently imploied
by the churches commaundment
for his admirable zeale, and powerful
eloquence in reducing Schiſmatickes,
and Sectaries of Italie, that your
grace may ſeeme to haue placed him
before your eies, as a patterne of your
actions, and the gouernement of your
Dioceſe. The verſes were heretofore

nameleſſe in many Latin editions of
theſe works, but now adiudged by the
learned to be S. Peter Damians. The
conſideration alſo, taken out of the
ſame Saints works, ſeemed to me, for
the profit therof, to be a fitt end, and
concluſion of this my tranſlation, as
a point most neceſſarie to remaine alwaies
in the memorie of the faithfull
reader.
            All this I offer vnto your grace, by
the commaundment of my Superiours,
and myne owne deſire, in the name of
all English Benedictins, whoſe prayers
vnto almighty God shall neuer be
wanting for the long life, health,
and proſperous direction of your gracious
Lordshippe in all vertue, and
happineſse. From my Cell in Dieulewart,
your Lordshipps beloued monasterie,
where by the leaue of obedience
I meane to ſpend the remainder of my
life, and remaine alwaies.

CHAPT. I.
                     
                        O Lord my God graunt vnto my
harte to deſire thee, by deſiring
to ſeeke thee, by ſeeking
to finde thee, by findinge to
loue thee, by louing to purchaſe pardonne
for my ſinnes committed heeretofore,
and being pardonned to commit
them noe mo
                           •
                        e. Graunt, o Lord my
God, repentance vnto my hart, ſorrowe
vnto my ſoule a fountaine of teares vnto
mine eies, aboundance of almes vnto
my handes. O my kinge, extinguiſhe in

me the heate of vnlawfull luſte, and
kindle in me the fire of thy loue. O my
redeemer, expell from me the ſpirit of
pride and arrogancie, and mercifully
graunt me the treaſure of thy humilitie.
O my Sauiour, rem
                           •
                        ue from me all anger
and teſtineſſe, and gratiouſly giue
me the ſhielde of patience. O my Creator,
roote out of me all bitternes of affection,
and beſtow vpon me the ſweetneſſe
of a milde diſpoſition. Giue me
(moſt mercifull Father) a firme faith, a
fittinge hope, a neuer failinge charitie.
O my gouerner turne from me all vanirie,
inconſtancie of minde, inſtabilitie of
hart, ſcurrilitie of ſpeeche, loftines in
my lookes, inordinate appetite of eating,
reuilinge of my neighbours and
brethren, the vice of detraction. The
itche of curioſitie, the deſire of riches,
the pillinge and polinge of ſuch as are
mightie, the affectation of vaine glorie:
the euill of hypocriſie, the poiſon of
flatterie, the deſpiſing of ſuch as are in
miſerie and neede, the oppreſſinge of
ſuch as are weake and impoueriſhed, the
heate of auarice, the ruſte of enuie, the
death of blaſphemie. O my maker, cut
off in me indiſcrete raſhnes, ſtubbernes,
vnquietnes, idlenes, drouſines, ſlouthfullnes,
dulnes of minde, blindnes of

harte, ſtiffenes in opinion, cruelty in my
manners and conditions, diſobedience to
that which is profitable, repugnance to
good counſell, exceſſe of ſpeaking, pillinge
of poore men, wronging of weake
men, falſe ſurmiſes againſt thoſe that are
innocent, negligence towardes thoſe
vnder my charge, crueltie towardes
thoſe with whome I liue, impietie towardes
my friendes and familiars, harde
dealinge towardes my neighboures. O
my God my mercie, I beſeeche thee by
thy beloued Sonne, graunt me the workes
of mercie, the exerciſes of pietie; to
take pittie on the afflicted, to giue counſell
to ſuche as erre, and are deceiued, to
ſuccour ſuch as are in miſerie, to helpe
thoſe that are needie, to ſolace thoſe that
are ſadde, to eaſe thoſe that are oppreſſed,
to helpe the helpleſſe, to comforte
the comfortleſſe, to forgiue my debters,
to pardonne thoſe that haue offended
me, to loue thoſe which doe hate
me, to render good for euill, to deſpiſe
noe man, but rather to reuerence all
men: to imitate ſuche as are good, to take
heede of ſuche as are euill: to embrace
vertue, to reiect vice, patience in aduerſitie,
continence in proſperitie, warineſſe
in my ſpeeche, a doore of circumſpection
to my lipps, to treade vnder foote by cō
                        tempt

all thinges temporall, to deſire
greately thoſe that are eternall.
                  
                  
                     Mans acknowledging his miſerie, his
his commendation likewiſe
of Gods mercie.
CHAPT. II.
                     BEholde, o my maker, I haue damanded
of thee many thinges, and thoſe
not ſmall, albeit I haue deſerued nothing
at all. I confeſſe, alas, I confeſſe, that I doe
not onely not deſerue theſe guifts and
graces, which I haue demaunded, but
great and grieuous torments vppon me
to be inflicted. Notwithſtandinge, publicans,
harlotts, and theeues doe embolden
me, who on a ſoddaine being deliuered
out of the iawes of theire ghoſtly
aduerſarie, are receiued into the boſome
of the true ſhephearde. For thou o God,
the maker of all thinges, albeit in all thy
workes thou art ful of admiratiō, yet art
thou moſt to be admired in thy workes
of mercie and compaſſion. Whence by a
certaine ſeruant of thine thou haſt ſaied
of thy ſelfe, his mercies are aboue all his
other workes. And as it were ſpeakinge
of one, we hope thou haſt ſaied of all
thy people: I will not take a way my mercie
from him. For thou diſdaineſt noe

man, deſpiſeſt noe man, hateſt noe man:
vnleſſe peraduenſure ſuche a one, as being
as it were beſides himſelf, ſhall hate thee.
                     Thou therfore not onely forebeareſt to

yet thou endureſt me. I

                         I repent, thou doſt

me; moreouer, whilſt I delay to do

for me lingering, thou inſtructeſt me being
ſimple, thou comforteſt me being ſorrowefull;

repaireſt me after I am fallen Thou giueſt
when I demaunde of thee, thou vouchſafeſt
to be founde, when I ſeeke thee, and
when I knock, thou openeſt vnto me.
                     Beholde, o Lord God of my ſaluation,
what to obiect I knowe not, what anſwere
to make I am ignorant. There is noe place
of refuge, to which I may flie from thee:
there is noe place ſoe ſecret, in which I
may remaine ſecret from thee. Thou haſt

ſhewed me the way of liuinge well, thou
haſt giuen me the knowledge of walkinge
as I ought, thou haſt threatned to puniſh
me with the paines of hell, thou haſt promiſed
to rewarde me with the ioyes of
heauen.
                     Now therfore (o Father of mercy, and
God of al comforte) pierce my fleſhe with

which thou doeſt threaten, I may eſcape by
fearinge thee, and giue me againe the ioy
of thy ſaluation, that thoſe thinges which
thou doeſt promiſe, I may receiue by louinge
thee. O Lord my force, my ſtrength
my God, my refuge, and my deliuerer, tell
me, what I ought to thinke of thee, teache
me with what wordes I am to call vpon
thee, make knowen vnto me, which way
I may pleaſe thee. One thinge (doutleſſe)
I knowe, with which thou art appeaſed,
and an other which thou doeſt not deſpiſe:
verily an afflicted or troubled ſpirit is
to thee a ſacrifice acceptable, ſoe is likewiſe
a harte that is contrite and humble. O my
God and mine ayde, enriche me with theſe
guifts, barricade me with theſe bulwarkes
againſt mine ennimie, graunte me this
refreſhinge againſt the flames of my vitious
inclinations, ſet open this pious place
of refuge, to which I may flie from the tumults
of mine inordinate affections.

the truth, there occure to my memory many
ſinfull imaginations which reprehende
the boldnes of my preſuminge affections.

noe man ſhalbe iuſtified in thy ſight. My
hope is not in the ſonnes of men Whom
wouldeſt thou find iuſtified if thou ſhouldeſt
iudge ſeuerely, ſetting mercie aſide?
Neither is there any thinge whereof a iuſt
man may vaunt, or which can bringe him
to glorie, vnleſſe thou preuent him afore

hande (being of him ſelfe vniuſt) with
thy mercy and pittie. I therfore (o my Saujour)
belieue what I haue hearde, that it
is thy goodnes that doth drawe me to repentance,
thy hony-ſweete lipps haue
toulde it me. Noeman can come to me
vnleſſe my Father, who hath ſent me
drawe him. Seeinge therefore it hath
pleaſed thee to inſtruct me, and by inſtruction,
haſt vouchſafed mercifully to enforme
me. I beſeech thee with all the forces
of my harte and minde, o almightie
father, togeather with thy moſt beloued
ſonne: I beſeeche thee likewiſe o moſt
ſweete ſonne, together with the moſt gratious
hohe Ghoſt, vouchſafe to draw me,
that I may runne after thee by vertue of

                     The helpe of God the father is deſired,
by the merits of God the ſonne.
CHAPT. V.
                     VNto thee I crie (o my God) vnto thee
I call, for that thou art nighe to all
thoſe that crie and call vpon thee in the
truth. Thou art the truth, reach me I beſeech
thee for thy mercies ſake, teache
me, o ſacred truthe, to call vpon thee in
the truthe, and for that I knowe not how

this ought to be donne. I humbly deſire
thee (o bleſſed truth) that thou wilt vouchſafe
to teache me: becauſe wiſedome
without thee is meere ignorance, but the
knowledge of thee is an abſolute ſcience.
Inſtruct me (o diuine wiſedome) & teache
me thy lawe, becauſe I aſſure my ſelfe that
man ſhalbe happie, whome thou ſhalt vouchſafe
to inſtruct and 
                           •
                        each in thy law.
                     I deſire to implore thy aſſiſtance, which
I beſeeche thee let be donne in the truth.
What is it to implore the aſſiſtance of the
truthe in the truthe, ſauinge onely the aſſiſtance
of the father in the ſonne? Thy
worde therfore (o holy Father) is the truthe,
the truthe being likewiſe the beginninge
of thy wordes. For this is the beginninge
of thy wordes, that in the beginninge
was the Worde. In that beginning
I adore thee, whoe art the beſt beginninge.
In that worde of truthe, I craue
thy ayde, o moſt abſolute truthe.
                     In which worde of truthe, may it pleaſe
thee (whoe art the ſelfe ſame truthe) to
direct and inſtruct me in the truthe: for
what is more ſweete, then to call vppon
the father, in the name of his onely begotten
ſonne, to moue the father to mercie
by remembrance of his childe, to appeaſe
the kings ſury, by naminge his deareſt progenie?
By theſe meanes are fellons deliuered

out of priſon, thus they that lie fettered,
are freed from theire irons, thus they
that are condemned, obtaine not onely to
be quit and abſolued, but likewiſe with
unexpected fauoures to he rewarded, to
wit, by making knowen to the Princes
thus incenſed, the loue of theire childe ſoe
muche beloued: in this manner likewiſe
doe ſeruants eſcape the puniſhment of
theire maiſters, when they haue offended,
whilſt the ſweetnes of theire children,
doth make interceſſion for them, that they
may be pardonned.
                     After the ſame manner, I beſeeche thee
o father omnipotent by the loue of thy
omnipotent ſonne, deliuer my ſoule out of
priſon, to the end it may more freely confeſſe
thy name. I beſeeche thee by thy coeternall
and onely ſonne, deliuer me from
the irons and fetters of ſinne, and by the
interceſſion of thy moſt deare childe ſittinge
at thy right hande, vouchſafe to reſtore
me to life, beinge by him appeaſed,
albeit my meritts doe adiudge me to be
condemned.
                     Certainely I knowe noe other mediatour,
whome I may ſende vnto thee, but
him onely, whoe is the ſacrifice offered
for the reconciliation of our ſinnes, whoe
ſitteth at thy right hande, makinge interceſſion
for vs. Loe this is my aduocate

with thee o God the father Loe this is
that high Prieſt, whoe needeth not to be
purged with an others bloude, for that he
ſhineth beinge ſprinkled with his owne.
Loe this is that ſacred hoſte, ſoe pleaſinge
and ful of perfection offered and accepted
ſo a

lambe without blemiſh, who before thoſe
that ſheared him, hea

                        d his peace, for that
beinge buffeted, ſpit vpon, and reuiled, he
did not ſoe muche as open his mouth.
Thus he that was free from ſinne, tooke
vpon him the burden of our ſinnes, and by
his owne woundes, cured out ſoares.
                  
                  
                     Heere man doth repreſent to God the
Father, the paſsion of his ſonne.
CHAPT. VI

eies of thy maieſtie, vppon the worke of
thine unſpeakeable mercie. Beholde thy
ſweete ſonne ſtretched forth at lenght on
the croſſe. Looke vppon his innocent handes,
guſhing for the ſtreames of innocent
bloude, and being pacified, remit the miſdeedes,
which my hande
                           •
                         haue committed.
Conſider his naked ſide, pierced throughe
with a cruell lance, and cleanſe me in
that ſacred fontaine, which I do belieue to
haue flowed from thence. See his vndefiled
feete (whoe neuer ſtoode in the way
of ſinners, but alwaies walked in thy lawe)
faſtned with longe and boyſterous nayles:
and gratiouſly make perfect my paces in
thy paths, makinge me to hate and abhor
all the waies of iniquitie. Remoue from
me the way of iniquitte, and mercifullie
make me to choſe the way of veritie. I beſeeche

thee, o kinge of Sainctes, by thy
faincte of Sainctes, by this my redeemer,
make me to runne the way of thy commā
                        dements,
that I may be vnited to him in
ſpirit, who diſdained not to be cloathed
with my fleſhe.
                     Doſt thou not (marke o merciful father)
the heade of this thy younge and deareſt
ſonne (being bowed downe on his ſnowewhite
ſhoulder) reſolued into a deathe of
vneſtimable value? Looke vppon the humanitie
of thy beloued child, moſt meeke
creator, and take compaſſion of the weakenes
of thy weake creature. His naked
breaſt groweth white, his bloudie ſide loketh
redde, his out-ſtretched bowells become
drie, his comely eies growe dimme,
his kingly countenance waxeth pale, his
longe armes growe colde and ſtiffe, his
thighes (in whitenes like vnto Alablaſter)
hange downe, the water of his bleſſed
bloude, doth bathe his pierced feete.
                     Beholde (o glorious father) the mangled
members of thy moſt gratious ſonne, and
courteouſly call to minde, what my ſubſtance
is. Regarde the puniſhment of God
made man, and releaſe the miſerie of man
by thee formed. Conſider the torments of
the Redeemer, and pardonne the offence
of him, that was redeemed. This is he, o
my Lord, whome thou haſt ſtricken for

the ſinnes of thy people, albeit he be thy
well beloued, in whome thou haſt beene
well pleaſed; this is that innocent, in whome
noe fraude was euer founde, and yet
was he reckoned and reputed amongſt
the wicked.

to haue bene the cauſe of Christs
paſsion.
CHAPT. VII.
                     WHat haſt thou donne (moſt ſweete
childe) that thou ſhouldeſt thus be
iudged? What haſt thou donne moſt louinge
youth, that thou ſhouldeſt be ſoe
cruelly handled? What was thy ſinne,
what was thy fault, what was the cauſe of
thy deathe, what was the occaſion of thy
condēnation? I am the ſtripe that hath cauſed
thy paine, I am the faulte, for which
thou wert ſlaine, I am the default for
which thou didſt die, the miſcheife for
which thou wert treated ſoe cruellie. I am
the blacke and blewe ſtrokes of thy paſſion,
I am the trauaile of thy tormentinge.
                     O wonderfull manner of proceeding,
in a matter of iudgement and correction! o
vnſpeakeable diſpoſition, in a myſterie vnkowne!
The vniuſt doth ſinne, and the iuſt

is puniſhed The guiltie doth amiſſe, and
the guildeſſe is corrected. The vngodly
doth offende, and the godly is condemned.
What the wicked doth deſerue, the
good doth ſuffer. The debt contracted by
the ſeruant, is diſcharged by the maiſter:
what man doth doe, is endured by God.

Neither is it the parte of a creature,

haue ſent thy glorious onely begotten,
as a mediator betweene thee and me.
I haue (I ſay) ſent one to make interceſſion,
by whoſe meanes I truſt to obtaine
pardon. I haue directed thy Worde with
my wordes, whom I haue affirmed to
haue beene ſent for my miſdeedes; and
haue recounted vnto thee, the paſſion of
thy moſt ſacred ſonne, which I doe beleeue
to haue beene ſuffred for my redemption
I doe beleeue that his deitie
ſent by thee, hath vouchſafed to be cloathed

with my humanitie, in which he
thought it not ſtrange to endure buffets,
bondes, ſpittinges, deriſion, and mockinge,
yea to take patiently the croſſe, the
nayles, and the lances percinge.
                     This humanitie, whilome ſubiect to the
cryinge of infancy, wrapped in the ſwadlinge
cloathes of childhoode, troubled
with the trauailles of youthe, made leane
with taſtinge, wearied with watchinge,
tired with trauailinge, after that cruelly

owne conſcience to the end, that he, who
by his owne merits deſerued puniſhment,
may by the ſatisfaction of this (ſoe good a

whom hell was due for his ſinnes and iniquitie,

may hope in ſhorte time, by meanes
of ſoe good a guide, to be recalled to
the countrie of hauenly felicitie.
                     I haue beene able of my ſelfe to offende
thee, but of my ſelfe I cānot appeaſe thee.
My God is become mine ayde, to witt, thy
beloued ſonne, makinge himſelfe partaker
of my humanitie, that he might cure mine
infirmitie: to the end, that by the ſame
thinge from whence aroſe the cauſe of offence,
he might offer vnto thee a ſacrifice
of praiſe: and by this might make me acceptable
to thy mercie, that ſittinge at thy
right hande, he might alwaies ſhewe himſelfe
to be of the ſame nature and ſubſtance
with me. Beholde this is my hope, this
is my confidence.

the Father) haſt at any time beene ſent
alone, but of thy ſonne thus writteth thy
Apoſtle: But when the fulnes of time was

                        come, God ſent his ſo
                              •
                           re When he ſaieth,
he ſent, he ſufficiently declareth, that he
came at that time, ſent into this worlde,
when being borne of bleſſed Marie, euer a
Virgin, he appeared in our fleſh true and
perfect man.
                     But what is that which the cheife euāgeliſt
affirmeth of him, He was in the world,
and the world was made by him. Doutleſſe
he was ſent thither by taking vpō him our
humanitie, where he alwaies hath beene,
and is remaining by his diuinity. Which
Miſſion I verily beleiue with my whole
hart, and confeſſe with my mouth, to haue
bene the work of the whole holy Trinity.
                     Now how greately haſt thou loued vs
(o holy and louing Father,) how greately
haſt thou loued vs (o pit
                           •
                        ifull Creator,)
who haſt not ſpared euen thine onely
ſon, but haſt giuen him, for vs ſinners? He
hath beene obedient vnto thee vnto death,
euen the death of the croſſe, and takinge
our hand writing or obligation (wherin
we ſtoode bounde a
                           •
                         ſlaues to the diuell
by ſinne (and faſtninge the ſame to the
croſſe, he hath crucified ſinne, and vanquiſhed
death: he I ſay) who only remained
free amongſt thoſe that were deade, hauinge
power to giue his life for vs, and for
vs to take it againe.
                     He therefore is both a conquerour, and

an oblation offered for obtayning the cō
                        queſt,
and for this cauſe a conquerour, becauſe
an oblation for vs: he hath beene a
Prieſt and a ſacrifice. In him therfore (and
not without iuſt cauſe) haue I ſettled my
whole hope, hoping that by him thou wilt
cure all my maladies, who ſitteth at thy
right hande, & maketh interceſſion for vs.
                     My maladies and miſeries (o Lord are
greate and many, many and greate, for
that I knowe and confeſſe, that the Prince
of this worlde hath many thinges to lay
to my charge but for his ſake that ſitieth
at thy right hande our Redeemer, in whō
the Diuell coulde neuer finde any iniquitie,
deliuer me I beſeeche thee. Iuſtifie
me by him, who neuer committed any
ſinne, neither was there deceipt at any
time founde in his mouth.
                     By him beinge our heade, in whom was
neuer ſeene the leaſt ſpott of wickednes,
deliuer me, that am a ſmall and infirme
member of his. Free me (I beſeeche thee)
from my finnes, vices, faultes, and negligences;
repleniſhe me with thy ſacred virtues
and perfections, and make me complete
in good manners and conditions.
Make me for thy bleſſed names ſake, to
perſeuer all the daies of my life in good
workes acceptable to thee, accordinge as
thy holy will ſhall teache, and direct me.
                  
                  
                     
                     Of the confidence which a Chriſtian
ſoule ought to haue in Ieſus Christ,
and in his paſsion.
CHAPT. XIV.
                     WEre it not that thy diuine Worde (o
God) had beene made fleſh, and
dwelt in vs, I ſhould verily deſpaire by reaſon
of my manifolde ſinnes and infinite
negligences. But now I dare not deſpaire;
becauſe, if when we were thine enimies,
we haue beene reconciled by the death of
thy ſonne, how much more (being thus
brought in fauour againe) are we by him
made aſſured of ſaluation? For my whole
hope and vndoubted confidence, is in his
pretious bloud, which he hath powred
forth for vs, and for our good.
                     In him I breath and take comforte, and
truſting in his bounty, I deſire to come to
thee, not hauing any iuſtice or deſerte of
mine owne, but only that, which proceedeth
from our Lord Ieſus Chriſt thy onely
ſonne. Wherfore I giue thee thankes, o
God the moſt milde and mercifull louer of
mankinde, who by thy ſonne Ieſus Chriſt
our Lord, haſt powerfully made vs, when
as yet we had noe being, and haſt by him
wonderfully deliuered and recouered, vs

when we were paſt recouerie through
ſinne.
                     I thanke thy pitty, and rendre thee many
prayſes from the very bottome of my
hart, who (through the vnſpeakable loue
wherwith of thy mere goodnes thou haſt
loued vs beinge wretched creatures, and
vnworthy of any good thinge) haſt ſent
for our common good the ſame onely begotten
ſonne of thine from thy boſome,
to ſaue vs ſinners beinge then the children
of perdition.
                     I giue thee thankes for his ſacred incarnation
and natiuitie, and for his glorious
mother (the bleſſed virgin Marie) of whom
he vouchſafed to take fleſhe for vs, and for
our ſaluation; that as he was true God of
God, ſoe likewiſe he might be true man of
man. I giue thee thankes for his croſſe and
paſſion, for his deathe and reſurrection, for
his aſcenſion into heauen, and for the
rhrone of his maieſtie at thy right hande.
For he hauinge (for fortie daies togither)
appeared vnto his diſciples after his reſurrection,
aſcendinge in theire ſight aboue all
the heauens, and ſittinge at thy right hande,
powred forth the holy Ghoſt, (accordinge
to his promiſe) vppon the children
of adoption.
                     I giue thee thankes for that moſt ſacred
effuſion of his moſt pretious bloude, by

which we haue beene red
                           •
                        emed: as likewiſe
for that moſt holy and liuel
                           •
                         myſterie
of his bodie and bloude, wherewith
we are daylie in thy Churche ſedd and inebriated,
walhed, and ſanctified, and made
pertakers of his ſoue aigne Good. I giue
thee thankes for thy admirable and vnſpeakeable
charitie, through which, (by
thine onely and beloued ſonne) thou haſt
in this manner loued and releiued vs being
altogeather vnworthy.
                     Soe greately haſt thou loued the worlde,
as that, thou haſt giuen thine onely begotten
ſonne, to the end, that euerie one,
which beleiueth in him, might not periſhe,
but haue life euerlaſting: which life
euerlaſting conſiſteth in this, that (by a
pure and perfect faith and workes anſwerable
to the ſame) we knowe thee the
onely true God, and Ieſus Chriſt, whom
thou haſt ſent.
                  
                  
                     Of the ſurpaſsing great charity of the
eternall Father towards mankind.
CHAPT. XV.
                     O Infinite mercy, o ineſtimable charity
thou haſt giuen thy ſonne, to deliuer
thy ſeruant, God hath beene made
man, that man might be freed from the

power of the Diuell, when he was vtterly
vndonne. How kinde a louer of men hath
thy ſonne our Lord God, ſhewed himſelfe
to be, who thought it not enough to haue
debaſed himſelfe ſo lowe as to haue taken
humaine fleſhe for vs of the immaculate
virgin Marie, vnleſſe he had likewiſe
ſustained the torments of his paſſion,
pouring forth his bloud for vs, and for our
ſaluation.
                     Our good God hath come, being moued
thereunto through his goodnes and mercy,
he hath come, he hath come to ſeeks
and ſaue that which was loſt, & caſt away.
He hath ſought the ſheepe that was loſt; he
hath ſought and found it, and as a merciful
Lord, and vnſpeakeable louing ſhepheard,
he hath on his owne ſhoulders brought it
backe to the foldes of his flocke.
                     O charity, o pitty! Who euer heard the
like? who is not aſtonied at this ſoe feeling
an affection of his mercy? who is not
through admiration, almoſt ſtriken into an
extaſie? who is not moued with gladnes,
through this thy exceſſiue charitie, wherewith
thou haſt loued vs? Thou haſt ſent
thy ſon, in the likeneſſe of fleſh ſubiect to
ſinne, that he might conuince ſinno of ſinne,
& that we might become iuſt in him.
For he is the true immaculate lambe, who
hath taken away the ſinnes of the worlde,

who by dyinge hath deſtroyed our death,
and by riſinge againe hath raiſed vs to life.
                     But what recompence can we giue thee
(o good God) for theſe ſoe greate benefits
of thy mercie? What praiſes, or thankes
giuinge? Albeit we had the knowledge
and power of the bleſſed Angels, yet could
we not make any requitall anſwerable to
thy ſoe greate loue and goodnes; yea, if all
our members were turned into tonges,
yet woulde our poore abilitie be no way
ſufficient, to render thee thoſe prayſes,
which thou haſt deſerued. Soe that thine
ineſtimable charitie, which thou haſt
ſhewed towardes vs, being altogether vnworthy,
proceeding frō thy meere goodnes
and mercy, doth ſurpaſſe all the knowledg
and learning that either is or may be.
For that thy ſonne our God, hath not takē
the nature and eſſence of Angells, but the

                           •
                        eede of Abraham, becomming like vnto
vs in euerie thinge, ſetting aſide onely
ſinne.
                     Taking therfore vpon him the nature
and eſſence of man, not of Angells, and
glorifying the ſame with the ſtole of his
ſacred reſuriection and immortalitie, he
hath caried it aboue all the heauens, aboue
all the quiers of Angells, aboue the Cherubins
and Seraphins, placing the ſame at
the right hand of thy maieſtie: the Angels

praiſe it, the Dominations adore it, and all
the Vertues of heauen ſtand trembling, in
beholdinge him that is placed aboue thē,
God and man.
                     This verily is my whole hope and confidence.
Becauſe in him, to witt, in our
Lord Ieſus Chriſt, each one of vs hath a
part, each one of vs hath fleſh and bloud.
Where therfore a part of me doth raigne,
there I truſt to raigne my ſelfe; where my
fleſh is glorified, there I aſſure my ſelfe to
be likewiſe in glory: where my fleſh hath
rule and dominion, there I ſuppoſe to rule
my ſelf. Although I am a ſinner, yet I do
not deſpaire to be partaker of this grace
and fauour. And albert my ſinnes doe hinder
me, yet my ſubſtance doth require the
ſame: although my faultes doe exclude
me, yet the participation of the ſame nature
doth not repell me. For God is not ſoe
cruell, as that he can forgett man, and not
remember him, whom he carieth about
him, and whom for my ſake he ſeeketh to
bring to ſaluation.
                     Verily our Lord God is very milde and
mercifull, and loueth his fleſh, members,
and bowells. That fleſh of ours loueth vs,
which is in Ieſus Chriſt our moſt ſweet,
gratious and louing Lord God, in whom
we haue already riſen, and aſcended into
heauen, and doe already ſitt in glorie with

the celeſtiall ſpirits. In him we haue the
prerogatiue of our bloud, for that we are
his members and fleſh, and he likewiſe is
our head: by whom our whole bodie is
compoſed, according as it is written Bone
of my bones, and fleſh of my fleſh, & two
ſhalbe in one fleſh: And noe man at any
time hateth his owne fleſh, but cheriſheth
and loueth it. This is a great myſterie, but
I (ſaieth the Apoſtle) ſpeake it of Chriſt,
and of his Church.
                  
                  
                     Of the two folde nature of Chriſt,
who pittieth vs, and prayeth
for vs.
CHAPT. XVI.
                     I Rendre thankes therefore to thine infinite
mercy (o my Lord God) with my
mouth ha

                        e, & al the force I haue for all
thy benefits, by which thou haſt vouchſafed
ſoe wonderfullie to releiue vs whē we
were vndone, and this by meanes of thy
ſonne our Sauious and Redeemer, who
hath died for our ſinnes, and hath riſen againe
for our iuſtification and liuing now
for euer, ſitteth at thy right hand and maketh
interceſſion for vs; and together with
thee taketh pitty of vs, for that he is God
of thee God the Father) being coeternall

and conſubſtantiall to thee in all thinges,
whence it proceedeth that he is able to
ſaue vs for euermore.
                     Howe be it, as he is a man, (in which
reſpect he is inferior to thee) all power is
giuen him in heauen and in earth, that at
the name of Ieſus, euery knee ſhould bow
of thinges in heauen, on earth, and vnder
the earth, and that euery tongue ſhould
acknowledge and confeſſe, (o God and Father
almightie) that our Lord Ieſus Chriſt
is ſittinge with thee in thy glorie. It is he
indeed, whom thou haſt appointed to be
the iudge of the quick and dead: for thou
thy ſelfe iudgeſt noe man, but haſt left all
iudgement vnto thy ſonne, in whoſe boſome
are encloſed all the treaſures of wiſedome
and learning.
                     He himſelfe is witnes and iudge, iudge
and witnes, from whom noe ſinnful conſcience
ſhalbe able to eſcape: becauſe all
thinges are open and euident to his eies.
He truly, that was iudged vniuſtly, wil iudge
the world with equitie, and the people
with indifferencie. I therfore euerlaſtinglie
bleſſe thy holie name (o almightie
and mercifull Lord) and with my whole
hart glorifie the ſame, in reſpect of that
vnſpeakeable, and wounderfull coniunction
of the diuine, and humaine nature
in one perſon, to the end that God ſhould

not be one, and man an other, but one and
the ſame God and man, man and God. And
albeit the diuine Worde, by reaſon of the
wonderfull loue he had to man, hath vouchſafed
to become fleſh, yet neither of the
two natures haue beene transformed into
an other ſubſtance, neither hath a fourth
perſon, beene added to the myſterie of the
Trinitie: Becauſe the ſubſtance of the
Word of God and of man, hath beene vnited,
but not mingled together; to the end,
that that which had beene taken from vs,
might attaine vnto God, and that which
had neuer beene before, might remaine
the ſame with that, which had beene for
euer.
                     O myſterie worthy of admiration, o exchange
paſt explication, o maruailous benignity
of the diuine bountie, for euer to
be admired, and for euer to be beloued!
We were altogether vnworthy to be termed
ſeruants, and behold we are made the
ſonnes of God: the heires truly of God, and
coheires of Chriſt. From whom happeneth
this unto vs, and who hath raiſed vs to ſoe
great a dignity?
                     Now therfore, I beſeeche thee o God
moſt mercifull Father, by this thine ineſtimable
pitty, bounty and charitie, that thou
wilt make vs worthy of the great and ample
promiſes of thy ſame ſonne Ieſus

Chriſt our Lord. Make knowen vnto vs
thy ſonne, and confirme this, which thou
haſt wrought in vs: Accōpliſh that which
thou haſt begun, to the end we may be
founde worthy, to attiue to the full and
perfect grace of thy endleſſe mercy. Make
vs by vertue of the holy Ghoſt, to underſtand
and diſcerne, and with due honoure
alwaies to reuerence this great myſterie
of thy mercy, which hath beene made
manifeſt in fleſh, hath beene iuſtified in
ſpiritt, hath appeared to the Angells, hath
beene preached to the Gentiles, hath bene
beleiued in the world, and laſtly hath bene
aſſumpted in glory.

CHAPT. XVI.
                     O How much are we bounde vnto

with ſoe great a guift? being ſuccoured

God) giue me thy ſelte. Behold (o Lord) I
doe loue thee and if it be to little, make

much loue is ſufficiēt to loue thee withall,

of being embraced of thee, neuer ſtaying
vntill it attaine to remaine hidden in

the ſecret fauour of thy diuine maieſtie:
yet this I know, o Lord, that it goeth not
well with me, both within and without
me as often as I am without thee; for that
I eſteeme all manner of riches and aboundance
beſides thee, to be meere want and
pouertie. Becauſe thou onely art that
good, which cannot be changed into better
or worſe: thou art he alone, who ſimplie
art alone, to whom it is not one thing
to liue, and an other thing to liue happily,
for that thou art thine owne happines:
                     Howebeit we that are thy creatures (to
whom it is one thinge to liue, & another
thing to liue happily) ought to attribute
both our whole life and liuing happily to
thy onely grace and bountie. We therfore
haue alwaies neede of thee, but thou neuer
of vs, for albeit we were not at all, yet
nothing woulde be wanting to that good,
which thou art: We therfore haue neede
(o Lord our God) at all times to adhere
to thee, that by thy countinuall ayde, we
may be able to liue ſoberly, iuſtly and religiouſly.
                     True it is, we are drawen downwarde by
the burden of our humaine f
                           •
                        ailtie: but by
the guift of thy grace we are inflamed, and
are caried vpward, we burne, goe foward,
we mounte vpward and making aſcents
in our hartes, we ſing a graduall ſong, we

are ſett on fire through the good fire of
thy loue, and goe foreward. But what maketh
me now to ſoare vpp to the peace of
Hieruſalem? Becauſe I reioyce at thoſe
thinges, which are toulde me. We ſhall
goe into the houſe of our Lord. Our good
deſire getteth vs a place there, to the end
we affect nothing els but to remaine there
for euer.
                     Seeing therfore we haue noe permanēt
citty during the time of this life, but expect
one heere after, (becauſe as long as
we liue in this world, we are as ſtrangers
and pilgrimes in a forraine countrie, in reſpect
of thee o Lord) for that our citty and
habitation is in heauen: for this cauſe I am
accuſtomed (being guided by thy grace)
to enter into the ſecrett cloſett of my hait,
where I ſing ſonnetts of chaſte loue vnto
thee my king, and my God, groaning forth
moſt greuious ſighes in the place of this
my pilgrimage, where the dittie of my ſō
                        ges
are thy iuſtifications.
                     And calling Hieruſalem to minde, I doe
dilate the ſenſes and affections of my hart
in thinking thereof, in thinking I ſay) of
Hieruſalem my countrie, of Hieruſalem
my mother, and of thee the ruler, the beautifier,
the father, the defender, the patrō
the gouernour, the paſtor: the chaſte and
durable delightes, the conſtant ioy, and all

the good thereof, yea farr more then can
either be ſpoken or imagined, becauſe
thou art the onely ſoueraigne, and true
good: neither will I attende to any other
thing, vntill it ſhall pleaſe thee (my God
and my mercy) to ſett me at liberty from
the deformitie of this my corrupt body, &
being brought by thee in to the peace of
this my moſt deare mother (whither the
firſt fruites of my ſou
                           •
                        e are ſent already) I
may be conformed and confirmed in the
ſame for all eternity.
                  
                  
                     The diſtinction and difference betweene
that wiſedome which is Gods houſe,
and that which is diuine.
CHAPT. XIX.
                     THis (o God) is that houſe of thine,
which is not built of any earthly or
heauenly ſubſtance that is corporall, but is
altogether ſpirituall, and by participation
eternall: for that it ſhall neuer growe to
ruine or decay, in reſpect that thou haſt erected
it for all eternitie, thou haſt giuen a
commaundement, and it ſhall not paſſe away,
howbeit it is not coeternall to thee
o God, ſeing that by creation it hath taken

                           •
                        s beginning.
                     The firſt thing therefore created is wiſedome:

yett not that wiſedome, which is
altogether coeternal and coequall to God
the Father, by which at firſt all thinges
were made, and in whom at the beginning,
heauen and earth were made: but
that wiſedome, which was created ſpirituall
(to witt Nature) by contemplation
of the light, is become light. For that
wiſedome likewiſe (albeit created) is
termed wiſedome. Neuertheles there is as
great difference betweene that ſupreme
wiſedome, which is the creator, and that,
which is created, as is betweene the light,
which doth enlighten, and that which is
enlightned, or as is betweene iuſtice iuſtifying
(which thou o God art) and iuſtice,
which ariſeth from our iuſtification.
For we likewiſe (accordinge to the teſtimonie
of the Apoſtle) are termed the
iuſtice of God the Father, in thee his ſonne
our Lord.
                     Sithence therefore a certaine kinde of
wiſedome was created before all other
thinges, to witt, that of thy chaſte cittie
(Hieruſalē) our mother, which is aboue,
and is free, and to endure for euer in the
heauens; for this reaſon it hath beene
created a reaſonable and vnderſtandinge
ſoule: But in what heauens? cuen in thoſe
which doe prayſe thee, which are the heauens
of heauens, becauſe this is the heauen

of heauen prepared for our Lord, And albeit
we doe not find any time before this
wiſedome, which was before the creation
of time (being indeede the firſt of al other
creatures) yett thou, o eternall God the
creator of all thinges, art before it, from
whom it hath taken its beginning, though
not beginning of time (becauſe as yet time
was not begun) yett of his condition and
being: whereupon it hath its being and beginning:
in that ſorte frō thee, o Lord our
God, as that it is plainely an other thinge
and altogether different from thee, albert
we finde not any time either in it, or before
it. Verilye it is able at all times to
ſee and contemplate thy face, neither
doth it at anye time looke aſide from
the ſame. Whence it proceedeth that
it remaineth ſtedfaſt without either
chaunce or change. Neuertheleſſe it is
of it ſelfe ſubiect to mutabilitie, by
which it woulde become darke and colde,
were it not that beinge by greate loue
vnited to thee, it did ſhine, and growe
hote by thee, as it were by the ſunne at
midde-day.
                     Finally it is conioyned to thee the true,
& truly eternal God with that chaſte loue,
as that, albeit it be not coeternall with
thee, yett it cannot be ſeuered and ſeperated
from thee by anie variation and

mutation of time, but doth reſt in the moſt
true contemplation of thee alone. For that
thou (o Lord) doſt ſhew thy ſelfe to this
thy houſe louing thee, (like as thou haſt
commaunded) neither doth it neede any
thing els. Hence it is, that it doth not ſwarue,
or goe aſide either from thee, or from
it ſelf, but remaineth alwaies ſtable in the
ſame ſtate, by perpetually ſeinge thee, the
true light, by continually louing thee, the
chaſte loue thereof.
                     O high and happy creature, moſt happy
of all others, by being allwaies adherent
to thy happines! O happy and exceſſiuely
happy houſe, who hath thee, for her euerlaſting
Lord, and light. Neither doe I finde
any thing, which I thinke I may more fitly,
call caelum caeli Domino, the heauen of
heauen prepared for our Lord, then this
thy cōtemplatiue houſe, being thy delight
without defect, and without affection of
departing vnto any other thing, being a
pure minde moſt concordantly one, the
eſtabliſhed peace of the bleſſed Spiritts.
                     But theſe celeſtiall thinges are aboue in
heauen, hence lett that ſoule (whoſe pilgrimage
ſeemeth ouer long in this life)
try and ſee, if now it thirſteth or noe to
come to thee, if now her teares are her
foode, if now or noe ſhee demande and
deſire this one onely thing, that ſhee may

dwell in thine houſe all the daies of her
life. And who, but thou (o Lord) art her
life? And what are her daies, but thine eternitie?
Like as thy yeares which ſhall neuer
haue end.
                     Heere therefore lett that ſoule which is
able, conſider, and comprehende, how
much thine eternitie doth exceede all times,
ſeeing thy houſe, which hath neuer
been eſtranged and ſeperated from thee,
albeit it be not coeternall to thee, yett by
adhering perpetuallie, and continuallie to
thee, it is free from all mutation of time,
and being from time to time abſorpt with
the moſt chaſte delight of thy loue, it hath
neuer made ſhew of mutabilitie, by reaſō
of thee whoſe preſence it hath enioyed
perpetuallie, to whom it is conioyned in
all affection, and amity. To conclude it is
free from all variation, and ampliation of
time, hauing neither time to come, which
it may expect, nor time paſt, which it can
remember.
                  
                  
                     Heere man deſireth, that this houſe of
God, will pray for him.
CHAPT. XX.
                     O Bright and beautifull houſe of God,
I haue loued thy beauty, and the

place of the habitatio
                           •
                         of the glory of my
Lord God, the poſſeſſor and builder of
thee. Lett my pilgrimage day and night
ſigh after thee, lett my hart long after
thee, lett my minde thinke of thee, lett
my ſoule deſire to attaine to the bleſſed
felowſhipp of thy felicity; I ſay to him,
that hath made thee, that he vouchſafe
to poſſeſſe me in thee, becauſe he hath
made both me and thee.
                     Nay rather doe thou ſpeake to him, doe
thou entreate him to make me worthy
to be pertaker of thy glory; For albeit I
doe not preſume to demaunde by mine
owne meritt, to be admitted into thy wō
                        derfull
beauty, yett I doe not deſpaire to
obtaine the ſame, by the meritt of his ſacred
bloud, who hath redeemed me. Onely
lett thy meritts helpe me, lett thy moſt
holy and pure prayers (which cannot but
be effectuall in the ſight of God) ſuccoure
my ſinfulnes.
                     I haue gone aſtray (I confeſſe) as a loſt
ſheep, & my aboad here hath ben too too
long, being caſt farr from the face of my
Lord God, into the darknes of this exile.
Where remaining expelled from the ioyes
of heauen, I doe dayly bewaile with my
ſelfe the calamities of this my captiuitie,
making great lementation, and
in mournefull manner, ſounding forth a

dolefull ditty, when I remember thee (o
mother Hieruſalem) whilſt the feet of mine
affections ſtand at the entrance of thy
gates (o holie and comely Syon) not being
yet admitted to behold thine inner partes
wide open: but I hope one day to be brought
vnto thee, on the ſhoulders of my ſhepheard,
who hath built thee, that I may
dance with thee, through that vnſpeakable
pleaſure, wherewith they reioyce, who are
with thee in the preſence of God, and our
Sauiour; who in his fleſh through the effuſion
of his bloud, hath made peace and pacified
all thinges in heauen, and in earth.
                     For he is our peace, vinting both in one
who ioyning together two oppoſite walles,
hath promiſed to beſtow vpon vs in
the ſame manner and meaſure the fullnes
of thy felicitie, which conſiſteth in the
fruition of himſelfe for all eternitie:
ſaying, They ſhalbe equall to the Angells
of God in heauen▪ O Hieruſalem
the euer happy houſe of God, next
after the loue of Chriſt, be thou my ioy
and comforte, lett the ſweete remembrance
of thy bleſſed name, be a ſolace to
the ſorrowes and heauines of minde.

                        e o Lord, I am wonderfull werie
of this life, and paine full pilgrimage.
This life is a miſerable life, a fraile life, an
vncertaine life, a laborious life, an vncleane
life, a life myſtres of miſcreants queene

                           〈◊〉
                        , not worthy to be termed a life▪

                        es of death almoſt ech moment of
time, by the diuers defects of change and
alteration.
                     The time therefore, which we liue in
this world, how can we truly call it a life?
whom humore
                           •
                         puffe vp, whom paines

                           •
                        es doe parch, whō
the aire maketh ſick, whom reſting maketh
fat, and faſting maketh leane, whom
delightes make diſſolute, whom ſorrowes

whom riches lift vp and make ſtately, whō
pouerty doth abaſe and make lowly, whō
youth maketh to be magnified, old age to
be crooked, whom ſicknes weakeneth, &
ſadnes afflicteth. And cloſe as it were at the

heeles of all theſe euills, doth furious death
come after, cloſing vp the end of all the
delightes of this miſerable life in that faſhion,
as that being ended, it is as if it had
neuer been begun. And albeit this liuing
death and dying life, be repleniſhed with
theſe, and many more miſeries;

and bitter, as that the blind louers thereof
cannot but ſee and perceiue it, yet by reaſon
of the golden cup which it holdeth in
her hand, it cauſeth an infinite nomber of
fooles to drinke and to be wholy drunke
therwith. They therefore are happy (although
not many) who refuſe her familiaritie,
who contemne her delightes tranſitorie,
who abandon her companie, leaſt at
length they runne to ruine and perdition,
together with her, that deceiued them.
                  
                  
                     Of the happines of that life, which
God hath prepared for thoſe
that loue him.
CHAPT. XXII.
                     O Thou thriſe happie life, which God
hath prepared for thoſe that loue

him, a liuing life, a bleſſed life, a ſecure
life, a peaceable life, a beautifull life, a
cleane life, a chaſte life, a holy life, a life
voide of death, free from ſorrow, a life
without blemiſh, without heauines, without
vexation, without corruption, without
perturbation, without variation, and
mutation, a life full of all beautie, and dignitie:
where there is noe aduerſarie to
impugne vs, noe occaſion of ſinne to allure
vs, where charitie raigneth in perfection,
hauing noe feare of anie euil approaching
where there is one onely day which
is eternall, and one onely minde and meaning
of al, where God face to face is ſeene
apparently, and with this bread of life, the
ſoule is ſatisfied aboundantlie. O bleſſed
life it pleaſeth me much to thinke of thy
brightnes and excellencie, my hart is not
a little delighted, when I minde thoſe
good thinges, which are in thee.
                     The more I thinke of thee, the more I
loue thee, for that I am wonderfullie recreated
through the vehement deſire, and
ſweete remembrance of thee. It pleaſeth
me therefore to lift vp to thee the eyes of
my hart, to direct to thee the ſtate of my
mind, to frame towardes thee the affectiō
of a freinde. Verilye it delighteth me to
ſpeake of thee, to heare of thee, to write of
thee, to conferre of thee, to reade ſomething

daily of thy glorie and beatitude,
and often in my hart to thinke vpon what
I haue reade: that ſoe vnder the ſweete

bleſſed boſome.

into the pleaſant feildes of the holie
ſcriptures, where I gather the moſt greene
and wholſome hearbes of ſacred ſentences
by writing them. I eate them by reading▪
I chewe them by frequent meditation,

bleſſed, voide of death, neuer to haue ending:
where time without ſucceſſion of
ages is ſtill the ſame: where one continual
day without interchange of night, knoweth
neither time paſt nor to come: where

                     O would to God▪ (my ſinnes being pardonned,
and the burden of my fraile fleſh
being forth with laied aſide) I might enter
into thy ioyes, there to finde euerlaſtinge
repoſe, and might be admitted within the
walles of thy Citty, there from the handes
of our Lord to receiue a crowne of glory,
to the end I might be placed to ſinge as
one of that moſt ſacred quire, that with
thoſe moſt bleſſed ſpirits, I might helpe to
ſounde forth the praiſes of my maker, that
in preſence I might contemplate the face
of Chriſt my Lord and Sauiour, and might
for euermore behold that ſupreme, vnſpeakable,
and incomprehenſible brightnes
and ſplendour: and thus being from the
fare of death ſett at libertie, I might reioyce
for euer through the guift of perpetuall
immortalitie.

Come at length after ſoe many dangers,
and trauailes; enter into, the ioy of thy
Lord, which none ſhall euer be able to

CHAPT. XXIV.

CHAPT. XXV.
                     O Mother Hieruſalem, thou ſacred city
of God, thou deareſt ſpouſe of
Chriſt, my hart doth loue thee, & my mind
doth exceedingly longe after thy beautie.

and there is noe ſpott in thee. Triumph &
be gladd (o faire daughter of the Prince)
for that the king, (euen he that ſurpaſſeth
all the children of men in beauties excellencie)
hath deſired thy fauoure, and hath
been enamoured of thy beautie.
                     But what is thy beloued more then an
other beloued (o thou that art moſt beautifull)
My beloued is white and ruddie,
choſen of thouſands. As the apple tree among
the trees of the woodes, ſoe is my
beloued amongſt the ſonns of mē. Behold
I ſitt ioyfull vnder the ſhadowe of him,
whom I haue deſired, and his fruite is
ſweete vnto my throat. My beloued hath
putt his hand through the hole, and my
bellie hath trembled at his touch (C

                           nt. 5.)
In the night ſeaſon in my bedd I haue ſought
him, whom my ſoule loueth, I haue

ſought and founde him, I doe holde him,
and will not lett him goe, vntill he bring
me into his houſe, & into his bedd-chāber,
o my moſt gloriouſe mother. For there
thou willt graunt me to ſuck of thy breaſts
more perfectlie and aboundantlie, and I
ſhalbe in that manner ſatisfied with vnſpeakable
plentie, as that I ſhal not hunger
or thirſt any more during all eternitie.
                     O how happie will my ſoule be, yea
happie euerlaſtinglie, if I ſhall merit to be
hold thy glorie, thy felicitie, thy beautie,
thy gates and walles, thy ſtreetes, and manifolde
manſions, thy moſt noble citizens,
and thy moſt puiſſant king, ſitting in his
magnificence. Becauſe thy walls are built
of pretions ſtones, thy gates are compoſed
of the rareſt pearles, thy ſtreetes paued
with moſt pure golde, in which Alleluia is
ioyfullie and continuallie ſonge to God.
Thy manſions (which are many) are founded
vpon fower ſquare ſtones, built of Saphires,
and couered ouer with tyles of
golde, into which none doe enter, but ſuch
as are cleanſed, none doe dwell that are
defiled.
                     Thou art beautifull and pleaſant in thy
delightes (o Hieruſalē our mother.) None
of thoſe thinges are ſuffered or ſeene in
thee, which we ſuffer and ſee in this vale
of miſerie. In thee there is neuer any darkenes,

or night, or any change of time The
light that ſhineth in thee, proceedeth neither
ſtom lampes, or candles, nor from the
moone, nor from the brightnes of the
ſtarres, but God of God, the light of light
(euen Chriſt) the ſunnne of iuſtice giueth
light in thee. The white and immacultate
lambe, is thy moſt cleare and beautifull
light; The ſunne, and brightnes, yea thy
whole happines doth conſiſt in the contē
                        plation
of this thy king, ſurpaſſing all
others in fairenes. Euen the king of kinges
himſelfe in the middeſt of thee keepeth
continuall reſidence, compaſſed about
with his ſeruants.
                     There are the quires of Angells ſinging
hymnes, there are the companies of the
heauenly cittizens. There is celebrated the
ſweete ſolemnitie and feaſte of all ſuch as
returne from this ſorrowfull pilgrimage
vnto thy moſt ioyful reſt. There is the forſeeing
aſſembly of the Prophetes. There
is the myſticall nomber of the twelue Apoſtles.
There is the inuincible armie of
innumerable Martyrs. There is the reuerend
companie of holy Confeſſors. There
are the true & perfect Monkes. There are
the ſacred Virgins, and other holy woemē,
who haue ouercome all worldly pleaſure,
& likewiſe the weakenes of theire owne
nature. There are thoſe bleſſed boyes and

girles, who haue ſurmounted theire tender
yeares by theire mature manners. There
are the ſheepe and little lambes, who (as
from a wolfe haue now eſcaped from the
intangling ſnare of the pleaſures of this
life. All theſe reioyce and triumphe in theire
proper places, differing ech one from
an other in degree of glorie, but being all
alike in exceſſe of gladnes.
                     There charitie raigneth in full perfection,
becauſe God is all in all vnto them,
beſides whom they deſire nothing: whom
they eternallie doe behold, and by continuallie
beholding him, doe continuallie
burne in his loue: whom they alwaies doe
loue, and by louing doe prayſe, and by
prayſing doe loue: theire whole exerciſe
and all they haue to doe, being nothing els
but to praiſe God euerlaſtinglie, without
any difficultie.
                     Happie were I, yea happie indeede for
all eternitie, if after the ſeperation of my
ſoule from this my bodie, I might be admitted
to heare thoſe Canticles of celeſtiall
melodie, which are ſung in the praiſe
of the euerlaſting King, by the cittizens &
troupes of Saints of that heauenlie countrie.
Happie I ſay, yea exceeding and exceſſiuelie
happie were I, if I (poore vnworthie
wretch) might be thought worthy
to ſing, and in my turne to intone thoſe celeſtiall

Canticles; if I might be neare vnto
my king, my God and my capitaine, and
might behold him in glorie, euen as he
vouchſafed to promiſe vs, when he ſayed.
O Father my will, and deſire is, that thoſe,
which thou haſt giuen me, be with me,
that they may ſee my glorie, which I had
with thee, before the creatio of the world:
And in an other place: He that miniſtreth
vnto me, lett him followe me, and where
I am, there likewiſe ſhall my miniſter be:
And againe: He that loueth me, ſhal be loued
of my Father, and I will loue him, and
will ſhew my ſelfe vnto him.

in what manner that innumerable multitude
of bleſſed Angells and Saints doe
carrie themſelues in almightie Gods preſence?
What euerlaſting content they receiue

affection without anie affliction? What a

with fulnes; and a fulnes ioyned with

                     What kind of creature is this, that knoweth
ſoe much of all other thinges, and
yett is altogether ignorant of the manner
of its owne beginning. For albeit certaine
doubtfull thinges haue been written by
ſome cōcerning the originall thereof, yet
                           •
                        
we finde, that it is a certane intellectuall
ſpirit, made by the power of God the
creator, liuing euerlaſtinglie, if it be conſidered
in its owne manner: giuing life to

the mortall bodie, which it doth ſuſtaine,
ſubiect to mutation, ſubiect to obliuion,
ſomtimes fearefull, at other times ioyfull.
                     Loe here a thing moſt worthy of admiratiō.
O God the creator of al thinges, who
is incomprehenſible and vnſpeakable, we
reade, ſpeake▪ and write (without any ambiguity)
thinges ſurpaſſing high, and wō
                        derfull:

                         of men▪ we cannot

lett my minde omitt to think on theſe
thinges, and paſſe beyonde what ſoeuer
is created: lett it runne, and aſcende▪ and

ſtedfaſtlie with the eies of faith (as much
as is poſſible) on him that hath created
all thinges For this cauſe, I will make (as
it were) ſteppes or ſtayres in my hart,
and by them I will aſcende vnto my
ſoule, and from my ſoule vnto my vnderſtanding,
and from thence vnto God, who
remaineth aboue ouer my head.
                     What ſoeuer likewiſe is ſeene viſiblie,
whatſoeuer likewiſe is imagined ſpiritually,
lett be remoued fare off with a ſtrong
hand, from the ſight of my hart and minde:
that my ſole vnderſtanding walking in
all puritie and ſimplicitie, may ſpeedily
come to the Creator himſelfe of Angells,
ſoules, & all other thinges. Happie is that

ſoule that leaueth theſe thinges that are
heere beneath, & loueth thoſe aboue; who
placing the ſeate of her habitation in thinges
hard and difficile, doth from the high
rockes contemplate the ſunne of iuſtice
with the eies of an Eagle. Becauſe there is
nothing ſoe faire and pleaſing, as with the
view of the vnderſtanding and harts affection
to looke vppon Ieſus alone, and after
a manner vnſpeakable, inuiſible to ſee
him, that is muiſible and by this meanes
to taſte a more ſweete delight then that

(which iuſtice it ſelfe doth ſeeme to require)

paſſible. And that noe parte of thy ſubſtāce
or nature, is either made or compoſed, or
able by any meanes to be violated or chā
                        ged:
wherfore it is moſt certaine, that thou
canſt not be perceiued by corporall eies,
neither was it euer poſſible for any mortall
creature, to beholde thee in thy proper
eſſence and nature.
                     Hence it appeareth painely, that we (after
this life is ended) ſhall by the ſame
meanes ſee thee, by which the Angells
doe now beholde thee; although indeede
euen they themſelues, cannot comprehēd
thee, as thou art. In concluſion the omnipotent
Trinitie, is not entirely knowen, to
any other, ſauing to thee alone.
                  
                  
                     
                     Of the vnitie, and pluralitie of
perſonnes in God.
CHAPT. XXX.
                     BVt thou (o God) who art one in diuinitie,
multiplied by pluralitie of perſons,
canſt not by any nōber be nombred,
and therefore not able by any meaſure to
be meaſured;or by any balances or weightes
to be ballanced or weighed. Neither
doe we pretēde or take vpon vs, to declare
the originall & firſt beninning of this ſoueraigne
goodnes
                           •
                        , which thou art, from
whom, by whom, and in whom all thinges
haue theire being; onely in reſpect of
the participation which we haue with the
ſame, we ſpeake al the good therof which
we can. For thy diuine eſſence hath allwaies
beene, and is at this preſent voide
of matter, but not of forme, to witt, of
forme not formed, but the former of formes;
the which albeit thou doſt putt (as
it were a ſeale) to ech ſeuerall thinge, yett
doubtleſſe thou doſt make them different
from thy ſelfe, noe alteration of encreaſe
or diminution hapninge vnto thee by the
ſame. For whatſoeuer is in the nature of
creatures, is thy creature.
                     O God one onely Trinitte and a three

fold Vnitie, whoſe omnipotencie doth
poſſeſſe, rule, and fill all thinges which it
hath created, neuertheleſſe we doe not
ſay that thou doſt fill all thinges, as if they
did containe thee, ſeeing they are rather
contained in thee; neither doe we ſay, that
thou doſt fill them all particularlie: neither
is it lawfull to thinke, that euerie creature
accordinge to the greatnes of his capacitie
doth containe thee, that is the greateſt
more, and the leaſt leſſe, ſithence thou art
in them all, or they all in thee. Whoſe omnipotencie
comprehendeth all thinges
whatſoeuer, neither can any man finde
meanes to eſcape thy power; ſoe that he,
with whom thou art not appeaſed, will
not be able to gett away when thou art
offended: as it is written Neither from
the Eaſt, neither from the Weſt, neither
from the deſert mountaines, becauſe God
is iudge And in an other place. Whither
ſhall I goe from thy ſpiritt, and whither
ſhall I flie from thy face?
                     Wherfore the immenſitie, of thy diuine
greatnes is ſuch, as that we may
perceiue that thou art within all thinges,
but not included, without all
thinges, but not excluded. Thou therfore
art within all thinges, to the end
thou maieſt containe them; and thou
art without all thinges, that by the immenſitie

of thy enuironninge greatneſſe
thou maveſt include them. By this therefore,
that thou art within all thinges, it
a pea
                           •
                        eth that thou art theire creator,
and by this that thou are without all
thinges, it is manifeſt that thou art theire
gouernour. And leaſt all thinges which
thou haſt created ſhould be without thee,
thou art within them: and to the end all
thinges might be included in thee thou
art without them, not by any local greatneſſe,
but by thy powerfull preſence:
who art eu
                           •
                        ry where preſent and al thinges
are preſent to thee▪ although theſe
thinges a
                           •
                        e knowen to ſome, 
                           •
                        ett not to
all. Wherfore the inſeparable vnity of
thy nature, cannot admitt perſonnes,
tha
                           •
                         may be ſeparate; for a
                           •
                         thou art Trinity
in vnity, and vnity in Trinity; ſoe
likewiſe thou canſt not admitt ſeparation
of perſonnes.
                     True it is that thoſe perſonnes are
ſometimes named ſeuerallie and alone by
th
                           •
                        mſelues, that by this thou mighſt giue
vs to vnderſtand (o diuine Trinitie) that
thou art inſeparable in perſonnes, that
thou mightſt declare, that thou haſt no
name in anye of the three perſonnes,
which may not be referred vnto another,
according to the rule of Relation.
For as the Father is referred to the ſonne,

and the ſonne to the Father: euen ſoe the
holy Ghoſt is moſt t
                           •
                        u
                           •
                        ie referred to the
Father and the Sonne. Wherefore thoſe
names which doe either ſignifie thy ſubſtance,
or perſonne, or power, or eſſence,
(or whatſoeuer is properly called God)
doe equallie agree to all three perſonnes;
as for example, God▪ great, omnipotent,
eternall, and all thinges els, which are
ſaied of thee our God
                     There is not therefore any name of nature,
ſoe peculiare to thee alone (o God
the Father) as that it cannot be applied
either 
                           •
                        o the Sonne, or the holy Ghoſt.
We ſay o Father) that thou art naturallie
God; in like manner the Sonne is naturallie
God, and the holy Ghoſt is naturallie God:
and yett there are not three Gods, but naturallie
one only God the Father, the
Sonne, and the holy Ghoſt.
                     Thou therefore (o ſacred Trinitie) are
God inſeparable in perſonnes, and oughteſt
ſpirituallie to be vnderſtoode, a
                           •
                        lthough
thou haſt ſome names, which are
ſeparable or diſtinct in wordes, becauſe in
names which ſignifie thy nature, thou doſt
not by any meanes admitt the plurall nō
                        ber.
And indeede this is a plaine proofe
that the perſonnes in the ſacred Trinitie
(which is one onely true God) cannot be
deuided, becauſe the name of euerie perſonne,

hath reſpect vnto another perſonne:
If I name the Father, I ſhewe the
Sonne; if I mention the Sonne, I make
mention of the Father; if I ſpeake of the
holy Ghoſt, it is of neceſſitie to be vnderſtoode▪
that he is the holy Ghoſt of ſome
other perſons, to witt, of the Father and
the ſonne. This trulie is the true faithe,
proceedinge from founde doctrine This
is certainely the Catholique, and certaine
true beleefe, which God by his grace
hath taught me, in the boſome of our holie
mother the Churche.

thee, when with wordes of exultation
and confeſſion I doe power forthe my
ſoule vppon thee, as one reioyceth at ſome

banquet, or vppon a holie day. Neuertheleſſe
my ſoule is yet penſiue, for that it
falleth downe, and becommeth as an infinite
deepe pitt, or rather perceiueth it
ſelfe to be ſuch a one as yett. To whome
my faith (which in the night ſeaſon thou
haſt kindled before my feete) making anſwere
ſaieth: Why art thou ſadd, o my
ſoule, and why dooſt thou trouble me?
Put thy truſt in God, whoſe worde is
a light vnto my feete: hope and perſeuere
in him, vntill the night be paſt (the mother
of ſuch as ſinne) vntill Gods anger
be paſt, whoſe children in times paſt we
haue been; becauſe we were heeretofore
darknes; vntill this violent inundation of
waters be paſt, vntill the day appeare, and
the ſhadowes are departed, till then the
reſidue of ſinne remaineth in our bodie,
growen deade through iniquitie.
                     Wherefore (o my ſoule) put thy truſt
in our Lord, in the morninge I will preiſent
my ſelfe before him, and meditate vppon
him, and for euermore will confeſſe
vnto him. In the morninge I will preſent
my ſelfe before him, and by contemplation
will beholde him, who is the health
of my countenance and my God, who
will reuiue our deade bodies by meanes
of the holie Ghoſt dwellinge in vs, to the
end, that from hence forth we may become

light, and the children of the light
and of the day, not of the night, neither
of darknes, being as yett ſaued by hope.
True it is, that heeretofore we were darkneſſe,
but now we are become light in
thee our God; neuertheles as yet by faith,
not by ſeeing thee face to face. Becauſe
that hope which is ſeene, is not hope.
                     Thoſe immortall troupes of holie Angells
(o Lord) doe inceſſantlie praiſe
thee, and the celeſtiall vertues doe glorifie
thy name, who haue noe neede to
reade this, which I haue written of thee,
thereby to knowe thee, the ſacred and
vndeuided Trinitie Becauſe they alwaies
do behold thy face, in which without the
ſillables of times they doe reade, what
thy eternall will woulde haue to be dōne;
they doe reade, chooſe, and loue thee▪
yea they doe reade euerlaſtingly: and
that which they reade, neu
                           •
                        r paſſeth
away. By chooſinge and louinge thee▪
they doe reade the immutabilitie of thy
counſell, neither ſhall theire booke at any
time be ſhutt or folded together, for that
thou thy ſelfe art this booke of theirs▪
and ſhalt be for euer.
                     O how 
                           •
                        urpaſſinge happie are thoſe
heauenlieve 
                           •
                        tues, who are able to praiſe
thee ſoe holilie and purelie, with ſuch
exceſſiue ſweetnes, and vnſpeakeable ioy?

from thence they take occaſion of praiſe,
from whence they reioyce, that is by beholdinge
thee euerlaſtinglie, by which
they are made able to reioyce and to
praiſe thee: But we that are ouercharged
with the burden of our fraile fleſhe, who
are likewiſe placed a farr of in the pilgrimage
of this life, from the light of thy
countenance, and laſtly are diſtracted and
diſquieted through diuerſitie of worldly
buſineſſes, cannot praiſe thee worthily as
we ought▪ how be it we praiſe thee by
faith, not by ſeeing thee face to face; contrariwiſe
thoſe Angelical ſpirits by ſeeing
thee face to face, not by faith. Our fleſhe
is the cauſe of this, by meanes whereof
we praiſe thee in a farr meaner degree
then they. But albeit we praiſe thee after
a diuers manner▪ yet thou art one and the
ſame God creator of all thinges; to whom
ſacrifice of praiſe is offered in heauen and
on earth, and by helpe of thy mercy, we
hope heereafter to be made pertaker of
theire companie.
                     Graunt o Lord in the interim (during
the time of my abode in this fraile fleſh)
that my hart and tongue may praiſe thee,
and lett all my bones ſay: O Lord who is
like vnto the Thou art God almightie,
whom we worſhip and adore, three in
perſonnes, and one in ſubſtance of deitie,

the Father vnbegotten, the Sonne the
onely begottē of the Father, the holy Ghoſt
proeedinge from them both & remaining
in them both, the 
                           •
                        acred and vndeuided
Trinitie, one onely God almightie. Who
when we were not, haſt powerfully made
by our offences, haſt loſt and vndonne
vs, and when we were wonderfullie recouered
vs by thy pittie and goodnes.
Suffer v
                           •
                         not (I beſeech thee) to be vngreatefull
for ſoe greate benenefitts, and
vnworthy of ſoe mani
                           •
                        olde mercies.
                     I humbly craue, pray, and beſeeche thee,
increaſe our faith, inlarge our hope, augment
our charitie. Make vs by this thy grace,
to be alwaie; firme in faith, and fruitfull
in good workes, that by an vpright
and perfect faith, and workes worthy of
the ſame, we may by thy mercie attaine to
life euerlaſtinge; that there contemplating
thy glorie as it is, we may adore thy maieſtie,
and may all of vs ſay together, whom
thou haſt made worthy to beholde this
thy bliſſe. Glorie be to the Father, who hath
created vs, glorie be to the Sonne, who
hath redeemed vs, glorie be to the holie
Ghoſt, who hath ſanctified vs, glorie to the
moſt highe, & vndeuided Trinitie, whoſe
workes are inſeperable, whoſe Empire is
euerlaſtinge and perpetual. All glory and
ſonges of praiſe are befittinge thee, all

worſhipp, benediction, loue and thankes
giuing is due to thee; To thee our God be
aſcribed all honour, ſtrenght, and fortitude,
for euer and euer. Amen.
                  
                  
                     Heere man doth lament, for that when
he thinketh of God he is not moued
to compunction, ſeeinge the verye
Angells tremble and quake when
they beholde him.
CHAPT. XXXIV.
                     FOrgiue me o Lord, forgiue me o good
God, forgiue me, and be mercifull vnto
me, pardon mine ignorance, and my
manifolde imperfections Reiect me not
for my ouermuche boldenes, in that I beinge
but a ſeruant, and woulde to God a
good one, and not all together bad and
vnprofitable as I am, yea in this reſpect
very badd, for that I preſume to praiſe,
bleſſe and adore thee our God almightie,
terrible, and exceedinglie to be feared,
without contrition of hart, & a fountaine
of teares, without that reuerence and feare,
which is fittinge. For if the Angells
praiſing and adoring thee (albeit repleniſhed
with vnſpeakable ioy) doe tremble
and quake: how much more ought I ſoe

to doe when I ſtande before thee, ſinging
praiſes, or offering ſacrifice vnto thee?
whence is it, that my hart doth not pante,
and my contenance growe pale? and why
doe I not tremble in my whole bodie, that
by that meanes I might weepe and waile
in thy preſence inceſſantlie? I would doe
ſoe if it laie in my power, but I cannot
doe, as I deſire. And for this cauſe I cannot
but haue thee in highe regarde, as often as
I beholde thee with the eies of my faith
ſoe terrible, and wōderfullie to be feared.
                     But who can doe this (or any good
thinge els) without the aſſiſtance of thy
grace? becauſe our whole ſuccoure and ſafetie
doth wholy proceede from thy greate
mercle. Miſerable wretche that I am,
how is it that my ſoule is become ſoe ſottiſhe
and voide of ſenſe, that it is not exceedinglie
affraide, when it ſtandeth before
God, and ſingeth praiſes in his preſence?
Miſerable wretche that I am, how
is my harte ſoe hardned, that my eyes do
not without ceaſinge, flowe forth floudes
of teares, whiles the ſeruant talketh
with his Lord, man with God, a creature
with his creator, one that is made of
ſtime, with him that hath made all thinges
of nothinge?
                     Beholde (o Lord) I doe make manifeſt
vnto thee what I am, and what I thinke

of my ſelfe in the ſecrett of my harte▪ I
doe openly make knowen in the eares of
my brethren. Thou art riche in mercie,
and lib
                           •
                        rall in beſtowinge rewardes▪ giue
me of thy goodes, that by them I may
be able to ſerue thee: becauſe we can neither
ſerue nor pleaſe thee, except it be
by helpe of thoſe guifts, which we receiue
from thee. Pierce (I beſeeche thee)
my fleſhe with thy feare, lett my harte reioyce,
that it may feare thy name. O
woulde to God my ſinfull ſoule did feare
thee in that manner as that holy man did,
who ſaied: I haue allwaies feared God as
it were floudes of water flowing ouer
my heade.
                     O God thou giuer of all good thinges,
giue me (I beſeech thee) a fountaine of
teares, duringe the time of my prayers,
and prayſes which I ſinge to thee accompanied
with puritie of harte, and mirthe
of minde, that louing thee perfectlie, and
prayſing thee worthily I may (with the
palate of my harte) pereciue, taſte, & feele
how pleaſant and ſweete thou our Lord
art, as it is written: Taſte and ſee, becauſe
our Lord is ſweete. Bleſſed is that man
that truſteth in him bleſſed is that people,
that knoweth how to praiſe him,
bleſſed is that man▪ whoſe helpe is from
God, who hath ſoe diſpoſed the aſcents of

his harte in this dolefull vale of miſerie,
that by them he may aſcende vp to the
place of eternall felicitie. Happie are the
cleane in harte, for they ſhall ſee God,
happie are they (o Lord) that dwell in
thy houſe, they ſhall praiſe thee for euer
and euer.
                  
                  
                     A Prayer greatly mouinge the harte
to deuotion, and to the loue
of God.
CHAPT. XXXV.
                     O Ieſu our redemption, loue, and deſire,
God of God, giue 
                           •
                        are to me thy
poore vnworthy ſeruant. To thee I c

                        ll &
crie, with a loude voyce, with my whole
harte. To thee I call, calling thee into my
ſoule, enter into the ſame, and make it fitting
for thee, that thou mayeſt poſſeſſe it
without wrinkle or blemiſhe of iniquitie:
becauſe reaſon requireth, that a cleane
dwellinge, ſhoulde be prepared for ſoe
cleane a Lord to dwell in. Sanctifie me
therefor (I beſeech thee) thy veſſell which
thou haſt made, cleanſe me from malice,
fill me, and preſerue me full of thy grace,
that heere and for all eternity, I may be
made a fitt habitation for thy diuine maieſtie.
                     O moſt ſweete, moſt powerfull, moſt

louing, moſt deare, moſt powerfull, moſt
deſired, moſt ineſtimable, moſt amiable &
moſt beautifull Lord: thou art more ſweet
then honie, more white then either
milke or ſnowe, more pleaſant to the taſt
then nectar, or delitious wine, more pretious
then golde or pretious ſtones, and
more deare to me then all the riches and
honoures of this worlde. What doe I ſay,
o my God, my onely hope, and my ſurpaſſing
great mercie? What doe I ſay, my
happie and ſecure ſweetnes? What doe I
ſay in ſaying theſe thinges? Verilie I ſay
what I am able, not what I ought.
                     Woulde to God I were able to ſinge
ſuch hymnes of prayſes, as doe the quires
of bleſſed Angells. O how willinglie
woulde I beſtowe my ſelfe wholy in ſinging
and ſetting forthe thy praiſes? O how
deuoutelie in the middeſt of thy Church,
would I pronounce thoſe Canticles of celeſtiall
melodie, to the praiſe and glorie of
thy holy name? But becauſe I cannot doe
this, ſhall I therefore holde my peace? Woe
be to thoſe that haue not thee in theire
mouth, becauſe thou art he, that openeſt
the mouthes of ſuch as are mute, and makeſt
the tongues of infants to be eloquēt.
Woe be to thoſe whoſe talke is not of
thee, becauſe thoſe that are talkatiue and
full of wordes, are to be eſteemed as men

ſpeecheles, if theire talke doth not tende
to the extollinge of thy praiſes.
                     But who is able to praiſe thee worthily▪
o vnſpeakable vertue, and wiſedome of
the Father? Seeing therefore I want wordes,
by which I might be able ſufficientlie
to expreſſe thee (o diuine worde of all
power and knowledge) I will in the interim
ſay what I can, vntill thou vouchſafe
to call me vnto thee, where I ſhalbe able
to ſpeake what appertaineth both to thee
and me. Wherfore I humbly beſeech
thee that thou wilt not ſoe much conſider
what I ſay, as what I deſire to ſay. Verily
I greatlie deſire to ſpeake that of thee,
which is fittinge & meete, in reſpect that
all praiſe, thankesgiuinge, and glorie is
due vnto thee.
                     Thou knoweſt therefore o God (from
whom the very ſecrets of our hartes cannot
be concealed) that thou art more
deare and acceptable to me then heauen
and earthe, and all thinges els
                           •
                        , that are
therein: for I loue thee aboue heauen and
earthe, and all other thinges contained in
them, yea ſoe greate loue is due to thy
holy name, as that in compariſon thereof,
noe tranſitorie thinge doth deſerue the
fame.
                     I doe loue thee o my God very muche,
and doe deſire to loue thee ſtill more and

more. Giue me grace that I may alwaies
loue thee accordinge to the greatnes of
my affection, and according to the greatnes
of my obligation, that thou onely
maieſt be my whole intention, and my
whole meditation. Lett me thinke of thee
in the day time without ceaſinge: Lett me
dreame of thee in the night ſeaſon; Lett
my ſoule talke to thee, lett my minde diſcourſe
with thee. Lett my harte be beautified
by the light of thy holy ſight, that
hauinge thee for my conductor and capitaine.
I may marche forewarde from vertue
to venue, and at length may beholde
thee, the God of Gods in Sion.
                     During the time of this life. I doe ſee
thee obſcurelie as it were through a mrtroure
or looking glaſſe, but then I ſhall beholde
thee apparentlie face to face, where
I ſhall knowe thee▪ like as I am knowen of
thee. Bleſſed are the cleane in harte, for
they ſhall ſee God. Bleſſed are they (o
Lord) that dwell in thy houſe, they ſhall
prai
                           •
                        e thee worlde without end.
                     I beſeeche thee therfore (o Lord) by
thy manifolde mercies, by which we are
deliuered from eternall death, mollifie my
ſtonie harde harte, (harder then either
ſtone or iron) with thy moſt ſacred and
powerfull vnction, and make me at all
times to become a liuinge ſacrifice in thy

ſight by the fire of compunctiō. Make me
to haue alwaies in thy ſight a humble and
contrite harte, ioyned with aboundance
of teares. Make me in all my deſires as
one wholy deade to this wretched world,
and through the greatnes of the feare and
loue of thee, to forgett all thinges tranſitorie;
in ſo much, as that I may neither
greiue, nor growe gladd at any temporall
thinge, being free from the feare & loue
of whatſoever paſſeth away with time,
beinge neither depraued through flattery,
nor diſmaied through aduerſitie.
                     And for that the loue of thee is forcible
like vnto death, graunt (I beſeeche thee)
that the fierie and ſweete force of thy
loue, may wholy withdrawe my minde
from all thinges vnder heauen, that I may
adhere to thee alone, being fedd with the
only memorie af thy ſweetnes. Lett the
moſt odo
                           •
                        iferous ſmell of thee (o Lord)
deſcende, lett it deſcende I beſeech thee,
lett it deſcende, and with it lett the mellifluous
loue of thee enter into my harte.
Let the admirable and vnſpeakable fragrant
ſauoure of thee come vnto me, cauſinge
in me an eternall deſire and affection,
and producinge in my harte fountaines
of water, flowinge into life
euerlaſtinge.
                     Thou (o Lord) art infinitely good, and

therefore infinitelie to be loued and prayſed
of thoſe, whom thou haſt redeemed
with thy pretious bloud. O moſt liberall
louer of men, moſt louinge Lord, and
moſt iuſt iudge, to whom the Father hath
committed all iudgment, thou perceiueſt
in the moſt wiſe iudgement of thy righteouſneſſe,
whether this be iuſt and reaſonable
or noe, that the children of this
worlde, of the night and darkeneſſe, doe
loue and ſeeke after riches, and honoures
that are tranſitorie and cannot long continue,
with a farr greater deſire earneſtnes
and ſtudie, then we thy ſeruants doe loue
and ſeeke after thee our God, by whom
we haue been made and redeemed.
                     For if one man loueth an other with ſoe
greate affection, as that the one can ſcarcely
endure the other to be wanting; if the
wife be conioyned to her husband with
that feruoure of minde, as that through
the greatnes of her loue, ſhee can take noe
repoſe, being not able without greate
greife to ſuſtaine the abſence of her beloued
husbande: with what affection, deſire,
and feruoure of minde, ought that ſoule,
(whō thou haſt eſpouſed and linked vnto
thee by faith and thy manifold mercies)
to loue thee the true God, the moſt beautifull
ſpouſe, who haſt after that wonderfull
manner loued and ſaued vs, who haſt

donne ſoe many, ſoe greate, and ſuch vnſpeakeable
thinges for vs.
                     But althoughe the tranſitorie thinges of
this world
                           •
                        , haue theire particular loues
and delightes, yet is the delight and content
which they yeilde, farre inferiour to
that which proceedeth from thee▪ o Lord
our God. In thee the iuſt man is d
                           •
                        lighted,
becauſe thy loue is ſweete and peaceable,
thou being accuſtomed to repleniſhe
thoſe hartes, which thou doſt poſſeſſe, with
vnſpeakeable delight, ſweetneſſe, and
quietnes. Contrariwiſe, the loue of the
worlde and of the fleſhe, cauſeth a thouſande
woes, not permittinge the ſoules,
into which it entreth to be at any repoſe,
but continually vexeth them with ſuſpitions,
with diuers doubtes, and perturbations.
Thou therfore (o Lord) art the delight
of good and iuſt men, and truly not
without reaſon; for that in thee is true repoſe,
and a life free from moleſtation.
He that entreth into thee (o good God)
entreth into the ioy of his Lord, and ſhall
not be any more afraied; but ſhall finde
himſelfe happily placed in a moſt happie
habitation ſaying: This is my reſt for euermore,
heere I will dwell, becauſe I haue
choſen the ſame. And Againe. Our Lord
guideth me, and I ſhall want nothinge, he
hath placed me in a place of paſture.
                     
                        
O ſweete Chriſt, o good leſu, fill my
harte perpetually with thy vnquenchable
charitie, with the continuall remembrance
of thee, ſoe that beinge become as a fierie
flame, I may wholy burne through the
ſweetnes of thy loue, which loue in me let
be ſoe greate, as that whole fountaines &
flouddes of water may neuer be able to
quenche it Make me (moſt ſweete Lord)
to loue thee, and for thy loue to lay a ſide
the heauie and vnſuportable burden of all
earthly and carnall conſcupiſcences, which
doe moleſt and preſſe downe my wretched
ſoule: to the end, that being freed
from them, and runninge after thee in
the ſweete ſmell of thy odoriferous ointments,
I may at length (hauinge thee for
my guide) be able to attaine to the viſion
and fruition of thy beau
                           •
                        ie, and by the
ſame to remaine truly ſatisfied eternally.
For two ſeuerall loues, the one good, the
other 
                           •
                        uill, the one ſweete, the other bitter,
cannot in one harte poſſibly dwell together.
And therefore if any one doth loue
any thinge beſides thee, thy charitie in
him (o God) is not the loue of ſweetnes,
and the ſweetnes of loue, for thou art that
loue that afflicteth not but delighteth, that
loue that for euer remaineth chaſt and
ſincere, that loue alwaies burneth, and neuer
conſumeth.
                     
                        
O ſweete Chriſt, o good Ieſu, my loue,
my loue, and my God▪ inflme me wholy
with thy fire, with the loue of thee, with
thy ſweetnes and delecta
                           •
                        ion, with thy
mirth and exultation, with thy pleaſure,
and deſire, which is holy and good, chaſt
cleane, quiet, and ſecure, to the end, that
being wholy repleniſhed with the ſweetnes
of thy loue, being wholy inflamed
with the fire of thy charity. I may loue
thee my God with all my harte, force and
ſtrength, hauinge thee at all times and in al
places, in my harte, in my mouth, and before
mine cees: ſoe that noe receptacle
may be founde in me, to receiue the counterfayted
loue of thinges tranſitorie.
                     Heare, o my God, heare o light of mine
eies, heare and graunt what I demaunde of
thee, to the end thou maieſt heare me. O
moſt meeke and mercifull Lord, refuſe not
to heare me by reaſon of my ſinnes, but
for thy goodnes ſake, receiue the prayers
of me thy vnworthy ſeruant, and graunt
me the effect of my peticion and deſire▪ by
the interceſſion, prayer and requeſt of the
glorious virgin Marie thy mother, and my
Ladie, and of all the Saintes of thy heauenly
Cittie Amen.
                  
                  
                     
                     A moſt deuoute Prayer, demaunding
Grace of God to praiſe him
as wee ought.

                     O Chriſt our Lord, the diuine worde

God almighty of infinite mercy, who iuſtifieſt
the wicked, and rayſeſt to life thoſe,
that through ſinne were deade, who changeſt
ſinners from that which they were
before, vpholdinge them, that they fall
not any more. Remoue from me therfore
(I beſeeche thee) whatſoeuer in me is
diſpleaſinge vnto thee.
                     Thy eies I knowe doe plainely ſee mine
imperfections to be very manie. Wherefore
may it pleaſe thee to ſtretche forth
towards me the hande of thy mercie, and

with the ſame remoue from me, whatſoeuer
is offenſiue in me to the eies of thy
diuine Maieſtie. My health, o Lord, and
my ſickneſſe doe depende of thy power:
preſerue (I beſeech thee) the one, and
cure the other. Cure me, o Lord, and I
ſhalbe cured, ſaue me, and I ſhalbe ſaued:
thou art he, that doſt cure thoſe thinges
that are diſeaſed, keepinge them in
health after they are healed: thou art he,
that with the very becke and nod of thy
heade, doſt repaire thoſe thinges that are
ruined and decayed. For if it be thy pleaſure
to ſowe in my hart the good ſeed

of vertues, it is neceſſarie that firſt with
the hande of thy pittie, thou pluck vp the
thornes of mine iniquities.

deſired, beloued, and moſt beautifull
Lord, powre into my harte (I moſt hartlie
beſeeche thee) the aboundance of thy
ſweetnes and charitie, that I may neither
deſire, nor as much as thinke vppon
any worldly or carnall delectation, but
may loue thee alone, hauinge thee onely
in my mouthe, and in my affection. Write
in my breaſte with thy finger, the ſweete
remēbrance of thy hony ſweete name, by
noe forgetfulnes euer to be blotted out of
the ſame. Write in the tables of my harte,
thy moſt holy will, and thy iuſtifications;

that alwaies and in all places I may haue
thee and thy preceptes before mine eie
                           •
                        
who art a Lord of infinite ſweetnes. Inflame
my minde with that ſacred fire of
thine, which thou ha
                           •
                        t ſent into the world,
and doſt greatlye deſire that it ſhould be
kindled, to the end, that with teares I may
daylie offer vnto thee, the ſacrifice of a
humble and contrite harte
                     O ſweete Chriſt and louinge Ieſu, giue
me as I deſire (as I deſire with my whole
hart) giue me thy loue, which is chaſt and
holie, that it may repleniſhe, preſerue, &
wholy poſſeſſe me. Giue me likewiſe (I
beſeeche thee) in token of thy loue, a
fountaine of teares, trickling downe from
mine eies, that they may beare witnes of
thy tēder affection towardes me▪ let them
ſpeake and declare, how much my ſoule
doth loue thee, ſeing it cannot containe
it ſelfe from teares, by reaſon of the
ſurpaſſing great ſweetneſſe, ſurpaſſinge
greate charitie.
                     I remember (o louing Lord) that good
woman Anne, who came to the tabernacle
to deſire a ſonne: of whom the holie
ſcripture relateth, that after her teares
and prayers to this effect offered, ſhee remained
as one aſſured to obtaine, what
ſhee had deſired. Now when I call to minde
this her ſoe greate vertue, and conſtancie,

in not doubtinge to receiue what
ſhee demaunded. I cānot but be greatelie
greiued, and aſhamed1▪ For if a woman did
thus weepe, & perſeuer in weeping, which
did onelie ſeeke to obtaine a ſonne: in
what manner ought my ſoule to lament,
and to continue in lamentation, which
doth ſeeke and loue God▪ & deſireth to attaine
vnto him? how ought that ſoule to
lament and weepe, which doth ſeeke God
day and night? wh
                           •
                        ch refuſeth to loue any
other thinge ſauinge Chriſt alone? Verilie
we might very well wonder and be aſtoniſhed▪
if the teares of ſuch a ſoule were
not her continuall foode.
                     Wherefore (I beſe
                           •
                        che the) take pitti
                           •
                        
of me; and be mercifull vnto me, becauſe
the ſorrowes of my harte are exceeding
manie. Imparte vnto me thy celeſtial comforte▪
and deſpite not my ſinfull ſoule, for
which thou haſt ſuffered a death ſoe cruel.
Beſtowe vppon me the guifte of teares,
proceeding from an internall affection, &
loue towardes thee, which may breake
the bands of mine iniquities, and alwaies
fill my ſoule with celeſtiall gladnes
                     Although I durſt not demaūde to be pertaker
of that vnſpeakeable rewarde which
thou haſt ordained for true & perfect mō
                        kes
and religious men (for that I am altogether
vnable to followe the footeſtepps

of theire angelicall conuerſation) yet at
leaſt lett me obtaine ſome place or other
in thy kingdome, amonge the deuoute &
bleſſed woemen.
                     The wonderfull deuotion of an other
deuoute woman doth likewiſe come into
my minde, who with greate loue ſought
thee lying in thy graue, who (after thy
diſciples were gone) went not away from
thy tombe, but 
                           •
                        att ſtill, ſorrowfull and lamenting,
and for a long time together,
very bitterly weeping: and riſing vp from
the place where ſhee had ſitten, with watchfull
eies, and many teares, ſhee diligently
ſought thee againe and againe in euery
corner of thy ſepulcher (from which thou
wert departed being riſen) to ſee, if peraduenture
ſhee might any where ſee and
finde thee, whom ſhee ſought with ſoe
greate affection. Doubtles ſhee had entred
and ſought thee in the ſepulcher diuers
times before, and yett all was not enoughe
in reſpect of her ardent loue, for that
perſeuerāce is the perfectiō of euery good
action▪ And becauſe aboue others ſhee
loued thee, and with loue lamented thee,
and with lamentation ſought thee, and in
ſeeking continued cōſtantly: for this cauſe
before all others ſhee deſerued to finde
thee, to ſee thee, and to ſpeake vnto thee:
Neither was ſhee onely thought worthy

of this one fauour alone, but beſides this,
was made the meſſenger & Apoſtle (vnto
the Apoſtles themſelues) of thy glorious
Reſurrection, thou gently bidding and cō
                        maunding
her ſaying: Goe, tell my brethren
that they goe into Galilee, there they
ſhall ſee me.
                     If therefore this woman did in this maner
weepe, and perſeuere in weeping,
who ſought thee, as one ſhee thought to
be deade, albeit thou wert liuinge, who
touched thee with the hande of her faith;
how greately ought that ſoule to lament,
and perſiſt in lamentation, who beleiueth
with the hart, and acknowledgeth
thee with the mouth to be her Reedemer,
and to rule and raigne both in heauen
and euery where? how greately ought
that ſoule to groane and weepe, who
with the whole harte loueth thee, and
with the whole harte deſireth to ſee thee?
                     O thou-that art the onely hope, and ſuccoure
of ſuch as are in miſerie, to whom
we neuer pray without hope of mercie;
for thine owne ſake, and for thy holy names
ſake, graunt me this grace I beſeeche
thee; that as often as I thinke ſpeake, write,
reade, or talke of thee, as often as I meditate
of thee, and as often as I ſtande before
thee, to offer prayſes, prayers, and ſacrifice
vnto thee; ſoe often lett me with

teares aboundantly & ſweerely weepe
in thy ſight, that my teares may be my
foode day and night.
                     Thou truly (o king of glorie, and
maiſter of all vertues) haſt taught vs by
thy worde & example, to lament and
weepe ſaying: bleſſed are they that mourne,
for they ſhal be comforted. Thou thy
ſelfe didſt lament the death of thy diſceaſed
freinde, and with many teares didſt
bewaile the cittie, that in fewe yeares
after was to come to ruine. I beſeech
thee (o good Ieſu) by thoſe moſt pretious
teares of thine, and by all thy mercies,
by which thou haſt in that wonderfull
manner releiued our miſeries, graunt
me the guift & grace of teares, which
my ſoule doth much deſire and couet:
becauſe without thy guift I cannot obtaine
it, it being the Holy Ghoſt, that
doth effect the ſame, whoſe propertie is
to mollifie the harde hartes of ſinners,
and to moue them to compunction.
                     Graunt me the guift and grace▪ of teares,
like as in times paſt thou haſt donne
to our forefathers, whoſe footeſtepps I
ought to imitate, that I may during the
whole courſe of my life lament (as they
did) both day and night. By theire meritts
and interceſſion▪ who haue pleaſed
and deuoutely ſerued thee, take compaſſion

of me thy vnworthy ſeruant being
in great miſerie, & graunt me the guift &
grace of teares I beſeeche thee. Graunt that
the water of teares may flowe from mine
eies, as from a floude, that night and day
they may be vnto me in ſteede of foode.
                     O my God, let me become as a pleaſing
and acceptable oblation to be ſacrificed in
thy ſight by the fire of compunction, and
as a moſt gratefull ſacrifice, lett me be accepted
of thee in the odoure of ſweetne
                           •
                        .
O moſt louing Lord, lett me become as a
faire and flowing fountaine, in which let
this ſacrifice be daily waſhed from the filthe
of ſinne. For albeit by the aſſiſtance of
thy grace, I haue offered my ſelfe wholy
vnto thee▪ yet neuertheleſſe I doe dailie offende

greate frailtie.
                     Graunt me therefore, moſt bleſſed and
beloued God, the guift and grace of teares,
eſpeciallie through the ſweetnes of thy
loue, and the remembrance of thy manifolde
mercies: prepare this banquet in thy

graunt me this prerogatiue, that as often
as I will, I may be fedd and refreſhed with
it. Afforde me this fauour, for thy mercy
and goodnes ſake I beſeeche thee, that I
may ſoe drinke, and become drunke by
drinkinge of this moſt excellent cupp of

teares, that my ſoule may onely▪ thirſt and
growe drie through the loue of thee, forgetting
all worldlie vanitie and miſerie.
                     Heare, o my God, heare o light of mine
eies, heare and graunt what I demaunde
of thee. O moſt meeke and mercifull
Lord, refuſe not to heare me by reaſon of
my ſinnes, but for thy goodnes ſake, receiue
the prayers of me thy vnworthy ſeruant,
and graunt me the effect of my peticion
and deſire; by the prayers and interceſſion
of our bleſſed Lady the glorious
Virgin Marie, and of all the Saints of thy
heauenlie Cittie▪ Amen.
                  
                  
                     A Prayer greately ſtirring vp the minds
to compunction, if it be ſaied in ſilence
with attention.
CHAPT. XXXVII.
                     O Lord Ieſu, o mercifull Ieſu, o good
Ieſu, who haſt vouchſafed to die for
our ſinnes, and haſt riſen againe for our
iuſtification: I beſeech thee by thy glorious
reſurr
                           •
                        ction, raiſe me vp from the ſepulcher
of ſinne, and graunt me daylie a
parte in this firſt reſurrection, that in the
laſt likewiſe, I may be thought worthie to
receiue a portion. O moſt ſweete, moſt benigne,
moſt louing, moſt deare, moſt ineſtimable,

moſt deſired, moſt amiable, and
moſt beautifull Lord, who haſt aſcended
into heauen in glorious and triumphant
manner, and as a puiſſant Prince, ſitteſt at
the right hande of God the Father, drawe
me vp vnto thee, that I may runne after
thee, being allured by the ſent of thy ointments
ſoe ſweetelie ſmelling; that I may
runne without ceaſing, thou drawing and
conducting me running; drawe the mouth
of my thirſtie ſoule (I beſeech thee) to
thoſe riuers aboue of euerlaſting ſatietie:
nay rather leade me to the fountaine of
life (my God and my life) that there I may
drinke according to my capacitie, in ſuche
ſorte as that I may be able to liue eternallie.
For thou with thy ſacred and bleſſed
mouth haſt affirmed: If any one thirſt, lett
him come to me, and he ſhall drinke and
be ſatisfied.
                     O fountaine of life, graunt that my thirſtie
ſoule may alwaies drinke of thee: that
according to thy holie and true promiſ

                        ▪
waters of life may flowe from my bellie.
O fountaine of life, fill my minde with
the ſtreame of thy delight: make my hart
drunke with the ſober drunkennes of thy
loue, that I may forget all thinges that are
vaine and worldly, and may continuallie
haue thee in my memorie, euen as it is
written: I haue been mindfull of God, and

haue been delighted. Giue me thy holie
ſpiritt, whom thoſe waters did ſignifie
which thou didſt promiſe to beſtowe vpoz
thoſe that do
                           •
                         thirſt after thee.
                     Graunt, (I beſeeche thee) that I may
tende and aſpire thither with my whole
deſire and affection, whither we beleiue
thou didſt aſcende the fo

this vale of miſerie in body onely, being in
thought and deſire continually with thee:
to the end my harte may remaine there▪
where thou art my deſired, incomparable,
and moſt beloued treaſure. For in the
greate deluge of this life, where we are

                           •
                        oſſed to and from with continuall tempeſts,

                           •
                        oe firme ſtanding or aſſured

for neuer ſoe ſmall a ſpace: heere I ſay in
this wretched worlde, noe certaine peace
or aſſured reſt is to be expected, for that
where ſoeuer we are, warres and diſſenſiōs
doe moleſt vs, our enimies on all ſides doe
aſſaulte vs, out wardly are fightes, inwardlye

                     And for that we conſiſt of a two-folde
ſubſtance, partly of earth, partly of heauen,
our body which is ſubiect to corruption, is
a clogg to the ſoule, not ſuffering it to ſoare
vp to celeſtiall contemplation. Wherefore
my minde being my compagnion &

freinde, cominge as one wearied on the
way, lieth ſicke and diſeaſed, being rent &
māgled by thoſe vanities, throughe which
it hath paſſed: it is exceeding hungrie and
thirſty▪ and I haue nothing to ſett before
it, becauſe I am poore and needy.
                     Thou therefore o Lord my God, who art
riche in goodnes, and giueſt in aboundance
the dainties and delicacies of celeſtiall
fulnes, giue meate to my minde being
wearied, recollect it beinge diſtracted,
reſtore it to healthe being rent and mangled.
Beholde (o Lord) how it ſtand

by the bowells of thy cōpaſſion, in which
thou haſt vouchſafed to viſit vs, coming
downe vnto vs from heauen, open the
hande of thy pitty, to my afflicted minde
knockinge, and calling vnto thee: commaunde
likewiſe by thy accuſtomed courteſie,
that it may enter and be brought in
vnto thee, that it may reſt and repoſe in
thee, and laſtly by thee may be refreſhed
& fedd, who art the liuing and heauenly
bread: with which being filled and ſtrength
being recouered, let it aſcende to the
thinges aboue it, and being lifted vp with
the winge of holy deſire from this vale of
teares and lamentation, let it ſoare vp to
the heauenly kingdome.
                     Let my ſoule (I beſeech thee o Lord)

take the winges of an Eagle and fly without
failing, let it fly without ceaſing vntill
it come to the beautie of thy houſe, and
vnto the place of thy glorious habitation,
that there in the place of thy paſture
(which is enuirōned with pleaſant riuers)
it may be fedd with the foode of thy internall
conſolation, ſitting at the ſame table,
on which thoſe heauenly citizens
are wonte to take theire refection. Graunt
that my hart may reſt in thee, o my God,
my hart (I ſay) which is as aſpatious ſea
toſſed too and froo with continuall
floudes.
                     Thou therfore (o Lord) who haſt commaunded
the windes and ſea, after which
a greate calme did enſue, come and walke
vpon the waues of my harte, to the end
that all thinges within me may be ſtil and
quiet, that ſoe I may embrace thee the
onely good thinge which I deſire to poſſeſſe,
and may contemplate thee the gratfull
light of mine eies, being freede
from the darke miſt of troubleſome thoughtes.
Let my minde (o Lord) flie and retire
it ſelfe vnder the ſhadowe of thy winges,
from the inordinate heate of worldly
cogitations, that ſittinge there in the temperate
ayre of thy refreſhing. it may ioyfullie
ſing, ſaying: I will ſleepe and repoſe
in the peace of this one thinge (that is of

God alone.) O Lord my God, let my ſoule
ſleepe (I beſeech thee) by abandonning
whatſoeuer is amiſſe: lett it ſleepe by hating
wickednes, and by louinge iuſtice. For
what thinge is there, that can or ought to
be more pleaſing and delightfull vnto vs,
then amidſt the darknes and manifold bitternes
of this preſent life, to deſire diuine
ſweetnes, and to ſighe after eternall happines,
there to fixe the minde, where it is
moſt certaine true ioyes are to be founde?
                     O moſt ſweete, moſt louinge, moſt benigne,
moſt charitable, moſt ineſtimable,
moſt deſired, moſt beloued, and moſt beautifull
Lord, when ſhall I ſee thee? Whē
ſhall I be preſented before thee? When

When wilt thou deliue

                         me out of
this obſcure priſon, that I may freely confeſſe
thy holy name? that from hence forth
I may be free from all affliction? When
ſhall I be admitted into that admirable &
beautifull houſe of thine, where the voice
of ioy and exultation, doth refounde in
the tabernacles of iuſt men? They (o Lord)
that dwell in thy houſe, are happie, becauſe
they ſhall praiſe thee euerlaſtingly: They
are happie and trulie happie indeede, whō

becauſe thou art the fountaine of
life, and in thy light they doe ſee light, ſoe
that they the illuminated light, (by meanes
of thee the illuminating light) doe
ſhine like vnto the ſunne in thy ſight.
                     O Lord of all vertues, how wonderfull,
how beautifull, how gratefull are the
lodgings of thy heauenly manſion, my ſinfull
ſoule doth exceedingly couet to enter
into them. O Lord I haue loued the beauty
of thy houſe, and the place of the habitation
of thy glorie. I haue deſired of our
Lord one thinge, and I will aske it of him
againe and againe, to wit
                           •
                        , that I may
dwell in the houſe of our Lord, all my life
longe. Like as the harte longeth for the
fountaines of waters (when he i
                           •

ſoe doth my ſoule longe after thee my
God; When ſhall I come and appeare before
thee? When ſhall I ſee my God, whom
my ſoule doth ſoe much thirſt to behold?
When ſhall I ſee him in the lande of the
liuinge? for in this lande of the dyinge, it
is impoſſible with mortal eies to beholde
him.
                     What ſhall I therfore doe, poore wretche
that I am, being ſubiect to death and
corruption? What courſe ſhall I take? As

longe as we are in this corruptible bodie,
we are in reſpect of thee as ſtrangers and
pilgrims in a forraine countrie, not hauinge
heere any citty or certaine dwellinge,
but doe ſeeke for one in time to come,

longe hath my ſoule remained heere.
                     Who will giue me winges like vnto a
doue, that I may flie, and be at reſt? Nothing
can be to me ſoe pleaſant and good,
as to be with my Lord. It is good for me
to adhere to my God. Giue me grace therfore▪
I beſeech thee) that as lōge as I liue,
I may adhere to thee, as it is written. He
that adhereth to our Lord, becommeth
one ſpiritt with him. Giue me (I beſeech
thee) the winges of contemplation, by
which I may be able to flie vp vnto thee
into heauen And for that euery thinge
that is eui

thee the ſonne of iuſtice and by the darke
cloude of ſecular conuerſation, it be hindered

to celeſtiall contemplation.
                     For this cauſe I doe endeuoure to aſcende
vp to thoſe ioyes of peace, and to the
deligthfull and quiet ſtate of true light,
Vpholde my harte with thy holy hande,
for that without thy help it cannot aſcende.
I doe haſten thither, where ſurpaſſing
greate peace raigneth, and where continuall
quietnes ſhineth. Guide and conduct
my ſoule, and according to thy holy will
drawe it vnto thee, to the end that vnder
thy conducte, it may aſcende vnto that region
of plentie, where thou doſt feede
Iſrael euerlaſtingly with the foode of thy
veritie, that there (be it but in thought onely,
and for neuer ſoe ſhorte a time▪ it may
touche thee the ſupreame wiſedome, remaininge
aboue all thinges, ouer-going
all thinges, and gouerninge all thinges.
                     But many thinges there be, which
trouble my ſoule, and hinder it, that it
cannot ſoare vp vnto thee. Cauſe them all
o Lord by thy commaundement, to ceaſe
and be ſilent. Let my ſoule it ſelfe, be ſilente,
let it paſſe beyonde all thinges (all
thinges I meane created) let it mounte
aboue it ſelfe, and come to thee. Let it fixe
the eies of its ſaith on thee alone the creator
of all thinges, lett it aſpire to thee, lett
it attende to thee, lett it meditate on thee,

before its eies, and thinke vpon thee in its
harte, who art the true and ſoueraigne
good thinge, and that ioy which ſhall neuer
haue end. For albeit the contemplations,
are many wherwith a deuoute ſoule
is by thee wonderfully fedd and refreſhed,
yet is my ſoule in none of them all ſoe
much delighted and conforted as in thee,
and as when it doth meditate and contemplate
on thee onely.
                     O how greate (o Lord) is the aboundāce
of thy ſweetned how marueilouſlie
doſt thou inſpire and viſit the hartes of
ſuch as loue thee! how wonderfull is the
delight of thy loue, which they feele and
enioy, who affect and ſeeke nothinge but
thee, who deſire not ſoe much as to thinke

continuall heede night and day to
the cuſtodie of his ſenſes: that euen in this
life during the time of his abode in this
fraile fleſhe, he may be able in ſome ſorte
to taſte of thy vnſpeakeable ſweetnes.
                     I beſeech thee o Lord by thoſe moſt pretious
woundes of thine, which on the
croſſe thou haſt ſuffered for the redemption
of mankinde, frō which hath guſhed

forth that moſt pretious blood, by which
we are redeemed; wounde my ſinfull ſoule,

                         moſt ſweete Ieſu, before
the magnificence of thy ſweetnes, I confeſſe
againſt me myne iniuſtice. Beholde
o Lord, for that I was conceiued and

offences: becauſe thoſe ſinnes wherin I
was borne, were of neceſſitie, but thoſe
in which I afterwardes lay wallowing
were voluntarie. This notwithſtanding,
thou being not vnmindfull of thy mercie
and goodnes, haſt drawne me from my
fathers houſe, and from the tabernacles of
ſinner, inſpiring me with thy grace, to followe
thee in the companie of thoſe that
ſeeke thy face, who walk the direct way

pouertie.
                     But I ingratefull and forgetfull of ſoe
many benefits receiued haue after my entrance
into Religion, committed many ſinnes
and abominations, and where I ought
to haue corrected my faultes by doing ſatisfaction,
there haue I added ſinne vpon
ſinne. Theſe therfore (o Lord) are the
faultes, by which I haue diſhonoured
thee, and defiled my ſelfe, who thou haſt

created according to thine owne image &
ſimilitude) to wit, pride, vaine glorie, and
many other ſinnes almoſt infinite, by
which my vnhappy ſoule is troubled and
afflicted, rent and deſtroyed.
                     Beholde, o Lord, mine iniquities haue
ouerwhelmed mine heade, being vnto me
as a greiuous burden vnſupportable to be
endured: in ſoe much, that if thou (whoſe
propertie is to pardonne, and to ſhewe
mercie) doe not lift me vp with the right
hande of thy maieſtie, I ſhall woefullie
ſinke downe into the gulfe of eternall miſerie.
Beholde o Lord God, & ſee becauſe
thou art holy; beholde I ſay how my ghoſtlie
ennimie doth inſulte ouer me, ſaying:
God hath forſaken him, I will purſue and
take him, becauſe there is none that can
deliuer him.
                     Howe longe (o Lord) wilt thou thus
leaue me: Tu
                           •
                        ne backe and deliuer my ſoule,
o ſau
                           •
                         me for thy mercies ſake. Take
pittie of me thy ſonne, whom thou haſt
begotten in the greate greife of thy paſſion,
and doe not ſoe attende to my
wickednes, that thou forgett thy goodnes.
What Father is there, who ſeeing
his ſonne in danger, doth not endeuoure
to ſett him free? or what ſonne is
there, whom his Father doth refuſe to correct
with the ſtaffe of his pittie?
                     
                        
Wherefore o Lord and Father, albeit
I am a ſinner, yet I doe not ceaſe to be thy
ſonne, becauſe thou haſt made me, and
newe made me againe, like as I haue ſinned,
ſoe correct and amend me, and being
by the ſtaffe of thy fatherlie pittie corrected
and amended, commit me to the care
and cuſtodie of thy onely begotten ſonne
Ieſus Chriſt our Lord. Is it poſſible for a
woman to forget the childe of her owne
wombe? And albeit ſhee ſhoulde forget
it, yet thou (o moſt louinge Father) haſt
promiſed not to forget the ſame.
                     Beholde I cry, and thou doſt not heare
me, I am afflicted with greife, and thou
doſt not comfort me. What ſhall I ſay, or
doe, being in this extreame miſerie? Alas I
am altogether comfortles, and which is
worſe, am chaſed forth of thy preſence.
Wretche that I am, from howe greate
good into howe greate euill am I fallen?
Whither did I attempt to goe, and whither
am I come? Where am I, and where
am I not? howe is it, that I that did ſighe
after heauen, doe nowe ſighe through
ſoe great tribulation? I haue ſought comforte,
and haue founde affliction. And
truly it is better for me, not to be, then to
be without thee, o ſweete Ieſu. It is better
not to liue, then to liue without thee, the
onely true life.
                     
                        
Where are nowe (o Lord Ieſu) thine
accuſtomed mercies? Wilt thou be diſpleaſed
with me alwaies? Be appeaſed I
beſeeche thee, and take pittie of me, and
turne not away thy louinge face from
me, who to redeeme me, haſt not turned
away thy face from thoſe that did 
                           ••
                        ocke
and ſpit vpon thee. I confeſſe that I haue
ſinned, and my conſcience doth adiudge
me worthy of damnation, neither is my
pennance ſufficient to make ſatisfaction,
neuertheleſſe it is a thinge infallible, that
thy mercie doth ſurmount all offence
whatſoeuer, be it neuer ſoe abominable.
                     Wherefore (o moſt mercifull Lord) I
beſeeche thee doe not write any malitious
bitternes againſt me, neither enter into
iudgment with thy ſeruant, but according
to the multitude of thy mercies, blot out
mine iniquities. Woe be to me at the
day of iudgment, when the bookes of
our conſciences ſhalbe opened (wherein
our actions are regiſtred) when of me it
ſhall openly be proclaimed: See heere the
man, and his deedes committed. What
ſhall I doe, o Lord my God, at that dreadfull
day, when the heauens ſhall reueale
mine iniquitie, and the earthe ſhall beare
witnes againſt me? Verilie I ſhall be mute
and able to ſay nothinge, but holding
downe mine head through ſhame and

confuſion, I ſhall ſtande before thee ſhaking
and bluſhing.
                     Alas what ſhall I ſay? I will call and
crie vnto thee o Lord my God. Why am
I conſumed being ſilent? Neuertheleſſe if
I ſpeake, my greife will not ceaſe: and if I
holde my peace, I ſhall inwardlie be tormented
with vnſpeakeable bitternes.
Weepe o my ſoule, and make lamentation
as a younge married woman for the deathe
of her newe married husbande,
weepe and bewaile thy miſerie, for that
thy bridegroome (which is Chriſt) hath
forſaken thee.
                     O anger of the almightie, ruſhe not vpon
me, becauſe thou canſt not be contained in
me; verily there is nothing in me, that is
able to ſuſtaine thee. Take pittie of me,
loaſt I deſpaire of thy mercie, that by deſpairing
of my ſelfe, I may finde comforte
in thee. And albeit I haue donne that, for
which thou maieſt iuſtly condemne me,
yet thou haſt not loſt thy accuſtomed propertie
of ſhewing mercie and pittie. Thou
o Lord, doſt not deſire the death of ſinners,
neither doſt thou take pleaſure in the
perdition of thoſe that die▪ nay rather that

                        aſt they
inſult, & reioyce ouer me, ſaying, we haue
deuouted him.
                     Howe is it poſſible (o good Ieſu) that
euer any one can deſpai

                        e of thy mercie,
who when we were thine enimies, haſt
redeemed vs with thy pretious blood, and
haſt reconciled vs to God? Beholde o Lord,
protected with the ſhadowe of thy mercie.
I runne (crauing pardon) to the throne
of thy glorie, calling and knocking, vntill
thou take pittie of me. For if thou haſt
called vs to pardon, euen when we did not
ſeeke it, by how much more ſhall we obtaine
pardon, if we aske it? Remember not
thy iuſtice (o moſt ſweete Ieſu) towardes
me a ſinner but be mindeful of thy meeknes
towards me thy creature. Remember
not thine anger towardes me guilty,
but be mindefull of thy mercie, towardes
me in miſerie. Forgett my pride, prouoking
thee to diſpleaſure, and weigh
my wretchednes, imploring thy fauoure.
For what doth thy ſacred name Ieſu
ſignifie, ſauing onely a Sauiour? Wherfore,
o Sauioure Ieſu, be thou my ſuccoure
and protection, & ſay vnto my ſoule,
I am thy ſaluation.
                     
                        
I doe preſume very muche of thy diuine
bountie, becauſe thou thy ſelfe doſt teache
vs to aske, ſeeke, and knocke at the dore of
thy mercie. Wherfore I doe aske, ſeeke
and knocke at thy dore, as by thy wordes
thou haſt admoniſhed me to doe. Thou
therfore, o Lord, that willeſt me to aske,
graunt that I may receiue. Thou that doſt
coūſell me to ſeeke, graunt me likewiſe to
finde Thou that doſt teach me to knock,
open vnto me knockinge at the dore of
thy mercie. Recouer me being diſeaſed,
repaire me being craſed, raiſe me being
deade.
                     Vouchſafe likewiſe ſoe to direct and
gouerne all my ſenſes, thoughtes, and
actions in that which is pleaſing vnto thee,
that from hence forth I may faithfullie
ſerue thee, I may liue and giue my ſelfe
wholy vnto thee. I knowe, o Lord, that
by reaſon thou haſt made me, I doe owe
my ſelfe vnto thee, and by reaſon thou
haſt redeemed me, and haſt been made
man for me, I doe owe (if I had it to giue
thee) much more then my ſelf vnto thee,
by how much greater then me thou art,
who haſt giuen thy ſelfe for me. Beholde
I hau nothing els to giue thee, neither
can I giue thee this without thee: take
me therefore and drawe me vnto thee,
that I may be thine by imitation and affection,

like as I am by condition, and
creation. Who liueſt and raigneſt world

CHAPT. XLI.
                     O Lord Ieſu Chriſt, my redemption,
mercie and ſaluation, I praiſe thee,
and giue thee thankes, albeit farre inferiour
to thy benefits, albeit wholy voide
of deuotion and feruour, albeit leane and
without the deſired fatnes of that moſt
ſweete affection, which thou doſt require,
neuertheleſſe my ſoule doth render thee
thankes ſuch as they are, which althoughe

they are not ſuche as I knowe I am boūde
to offer, yet they are according to my beſt
endeuour. O hope of my harte, o ſtrength
of my ſoule, may it pleaſe thy omnipotent
worthines to accompliſhe, what my wō
                        derfull
greate weakenes doth attempt to
performe, becauſe thou art my life, and
the ſcope of mine intention. And albeit I
haue not hitherto deſerued to loue thee
ſoe muche as I knowe is due, yet at leaſt I
deſire to loue thee, ſoe muche as I ought
to doe.
                     Thou ſeeſt my conſcience o my light,
for that my whole deſire (o Lord) is in thy
ſight, and whatſoeuer my conſcience doth
attempt to doe that is praiſe worthy, I acknowledge
that it proceedeth wholy
from thee. If that (o Lord) be good which
thou doſt inſpire, (yea it is good indeede,
becauſe it is to loue thee) graunt that I
may doe that, which thou doſt cauſe me
to deſire. Graunt that I may loue thee, aſmuche
as thou doſt require.
                     Beholde I offer thee praiſes and thankes-giuing,
lett not this guift of thine be
vnprofitable vnto me (o Lord) which thou
haſt begunne, and graunt me that, which
thou haſt cauſed me to deſire, by preuenting
me with thy gratious inſpiration.
Transforme (moſt ſweete Sauiour) my
repiditie, into a moſt feruent loue of thee.

For the onely thing
                           •
                         that I deſire to attaine
vnto (moſt louing Lord) by this my
prayer and memorie of thy paſſion, is that
I may be able to loue thee with a moſt ardent
affection.
                     Thy goodnes (o Lord) hath created me,
thy mercy after my creation hath cleanſed
me from originall ſinne, thy patience after
baptiſme hath hitherto ſuſtained nouriſhed,
and expected me, being defiled with
many other ſinnes. Thou, o good Lord,
doſt expect when I will growe better: and
my ſoule (that it may be able to doe pennance
and to iiue well) doth expect the inſpiration
of thy gratious fauoure.
                     O my God, who haſt created me, who
doſt patientlie ſuſtaine, and louingly maintaine
me, I hunger and thirſt after thee, I
deſire, ſighe, and couet to come to thee.
And as a poore diſtreſſed childe depriued
of the preſence of his tender harted father,
doth with ſighes & ſobbes inceſſantlye
embrace in his harte the image and
ſemblance of his fauoure: ſoe fareth it
with me, as often as I call to minde thy
bitter Paſſion (which albeit it be not as
much as I ought, yet it is as muche as I am
able (when I call to minde likewiſe the
buffetts and whipps by thee ſuſtained, the
greiuous woundes by thee endured, whē
I remember in what cruell manner thou

haſt been crucified, and killed, in what
manner thou haſt (by thy deare freindes)
beene embaulmed and buried; as often
likewiſe as thy glorious Reſurrection, and
and admirable Aſcenſion, doe occure to
mine imagination.
                     All theſe thinges I beleiue moſt firmely,
lamenting with teares, the calamities
of my exile in this vale of miſerie: my
onely hope is the comforte of thy comminge,
my cheife deſire is to beholde thee
face to face in thy heauenly habitation. I
cannot but greiue, for that I haue not
ſcene the Lord of Angells, debaſing himſelfe
to conuerſe and liue amongſt men,
that by that meanes he might exalt men
to Angelicall conuerſation, when God did
die who was offended, that man might
liue, who had offended: I cannot but greiue,
for that I haue not deſerued to be preſent,
and to be aſtoniſhed through admiration
of a worke of ſoe wonderfull and
vnſpeakeable compaſſion.
                     Howe is it, o my ſoule. that the ſworde
of moſt ſharpe ſorrowe doth not peirce
thee to the harte, ſeing thou could'ſt not
be preſent to ſee the ſide of thy Sauiour
wounded with a ſpeare, ſeing thou couldſt
not be preſent to ſee the feete and handes
of thy maker to be faſtned with nayles,
nor the blood of thy redeemer to be ſpilt

on the grounde in that dreadefull manner?
Why art thou not drunke with
the bitternes of teares, ſeeing he was
made to drinke of the bitternes of gall?
Why doſt thou not take compaſſion of
the moſt chaſte Virgin Marie, his moſt
worthy mother, and thy moſt worthy
Ladie?
                     O my moſt merciful Lady, what fountaines
of teares may I affirme to haue flowed
from thy moſt chaſt eies, when thou
beheldſt thy onely ſonne (albeit free from
all offence) to be bounde, whipt, and
ſlaine in thy preſence? In what mournefull
manner may I imagin thy dolefull
countenance at that time to be blubbered
all ouer with weeping, when thou beheldſt
this thy innocent ſonne, thy God
and thy Lord to be ſtretched out vppon
the croſſe, and that ſacred fleſhe framed
of thy fleſhe, to be by thoſe bloodie bouche
                           •
                        s
ſoe cruellie rent in peices. With
what vnſpeakeable greife may I well
thinke thy poore harte at that time to be
tormented, when thou didſt heare thoſe
wordes pronounced: Woman behold thy
ſonne; And the diſciple: Beholde thy mother?
When thou didſt accept the diſciple
inſteed of his maiſter, and the ſeruant in
lieue of his Lord?
                     O that I had beene worthy with S.

Ioſeph to haue taken my Lord downe
from the Croſſe, to haue embaulmed and
buried him, to haue followed or accompanied
him to his ſepulcher, that I might
haue dōne ſome little ſeruice at ſoe greate
a funeral. O that I had with the three bleſſed
Maries, been ſtriken into amazednes
through the bright viſion of the Angells,
and had heard newes of our Lords Reſurrection▪
newes of my conſolation, newes
ſoe muche expected, and deſired. O that
I had hearde (I ſay) from the mouthe of
the Angell: doe you not feare, you ſeeke
Ieſus, that was crucified, he is not heere.
                     O moſt courteous, moſt ſweete, and
moſt gratious Ieſu, when wilt thou cure
me of my ſorrowe and penſiuenes, for
that I haue not ſeene the incorruption of
of thy bleſſed fleſhe? For that I haue not
kiſſed the places where thou wert wounded,
the places which the na
                           •
                        les had pei
                           •
                        
                        ced?
For that I haue not bedewed with
teares of ioy, the ſcarrs of thy true bodie?
O admirable, ineſtimable and incomparable
Lord and Sauiour, when wilt thou
comforte and cure me of the greife which
I endure? Becauſe my ſorrowe will neuer
ceaſe to afflict me, as lōg as I liuet o Lord)
ſeperated from thee.
                     Take pittie of me, o Lord, take pittie
of my ſoule Thou haſt departed, o Lord,

without bidding me farewell. Beginninge
to mounte vp into heauen, thou haſt bleſſed
thy freindes there aſſembled, and I
was not preſent to ſee it. Lifting vp thy
handes, thou haſt beene receiued by a
cloude into heauen, and I was not preſent
to beholde it. The Angells haue promiſed
that thou wouldeſt returne, and I did not
heare it.
                     What ſhall I ſay? What ſhall I doe?
Whither ſhall I goe? Where ſhall I ſeeke
him▪ and when ſhall I finde him? Of whom
ſhall I aske for him? Who will tell my
beloued, how muche I loue him? The delight
of my harte is changed into deſolation,
my laughter in lamētation. My fleſhe
and my harte, haue failed me, o God
of my harte, and mine inheritance euerlaſtinglie.
My ſoule hath refuſed all other
comforte and conſolation (o God my
ſweete delight) ſauing that which proceedeth
from thee alone. For what haue I
in heauen, or what doe I deſire vpon earth
ſauing thee alone? I couet after thee, my
truſt is in thee, I ſeeke after thee. My hart
hath ſaied to thee: I haue ſought thy face,
thy face (o Lord) will I ſeeke, turne not a
way thy face from me.
                     O moſt gratious louer of men, thou art
the protector of the poore, thou art a friende
to ſuche as are depriued of father

and mother. O moſt aſſured Aduocate,
take pittie of me a poore diſtreſſed orphant,
I am as a poore fatherleſſe childe,
and my ſoule is as a woman bereaued of
her husbande. Vouchſafe gratiouſlie to
behold the teares of my diſtreſſed orphancie
and widowhoode, which I offer vnto
thee, vntill thou returne, o my God.
                     May it pleaſe thee therfore, may it
pleaſe thee, o Lord, to manifeſt thy ſelfe
to me, and I ſhall be comforted. Graunt
that I may ſee thee, and I ſhall obtaine
what I deſire. Make manifeſt thy glorie,
and my ioy wilbe accompliſhed. My ſoule
hath thirſted after thee, ſoe hath likewiſe
my fleſhe exceedingly. My ſoule hath thirſted
after God the liuinge fountaine, when
ſhall I come, and be preſented before the
face of my Lord? When wilt thou come
o my comforter, for whome I will wiſhe,
and earneſtly waite for?
                     O that I might once behold my delight
which I doe ſoe muche deſire! O howe
truly ſhall I be ſatisfied, when thy glorie
ſhall appeare, which I doe greatlie hunger
to beholde? When ſhall I become drunke
through the plentie of thy heauenlie habitation,
for which I ſighe ſoe often?
When wilt thou make me to drinke of
the riuer of thy pleaſure, which I ſoe gre
                        
                           •
                        tely
thirſt and deſire? In the interim o

Lord, let my teares be my continual foode,
vntill it be ſaied vnto me: Beholde thy
God; vntill it be ſaied vnto my ſoule: Beholde
thy bridegroome. In the interim▪
feede me with my ſobbs and weepinges,
nouriſhe me with my ſorrowes and lamentations.
Peraduenture my redeemer
will come and viſit me, becauſe he is full
of mercie: yea, he will not be long in
comminge, becauſe he is full of pittie: To
him be glorie during all eternitie▪ Amen.

CHAPT. I.
                     
                        O Lord the ſtrength of my ſoule,
graunt me grace (I beſeech
thee) that like as thou knoweſt
me▪ I may knowe thee. O my
comforter, manifeſt thy ſelfe
vnto me. O light of mine eies, graunt that
I may ſee thee. Come o ioy of my ſpirit.
Let me ſee thee, o delight of my harte. O
life of my ſoule, giue me grace to loue
thee. O Lord my God my cheife delight,
and ſweeteſt ſolace, vouchſafe
to appeare vnto me, for thou art my
life, and all the glorie of my ſoule.
O deſire of my harte, lett me finde thee.

O loue of my ſoule, let me touche thee, O
heauenly bridegroome my cheife delight
both without and within me, let me embrace
thee. Let me poſſeſſe thee, o euerlaſting
bliſſe, lett me poſſeſſe thee in the
middſt of my hatte, bleſſed life, and ſoueraigne
ſweetnes of my ſoule. Let me loue
thee, o Lord my fortitude, my force, my
refuge and my deliuerer Let me loue thee

                        nioy thee the onely
beſt thinge.
                     Open mine eares by vertue of thy worde,
more peircing thē a two edged ſworde,
to the end I may heare thy voyce Let the
greatnes of thy voyce be hearde as a thunder
from aboue; Let the ſea roare and the
fulnes thereof▪ let the earth be moued,
and all thinges in them contained. Enlighten
mine eies▪ o incomprehenſible light,
ſende forth thy lightning, and dazell thē,
that they may not beholde vanitie. Encre

thy lightning▪ and dazell and trouble
them in that manner, as that fountaines
of water may appeare, and the foundations
of the whole worlde may be diſcouered.
                     O light inuiſible, giue me that ſight,
that may ſee thee. O ſauoure of life, create

in me a newe ſmell, which may make me
runne after thee, in the odoure of thy
oyntments. Cure my taſte, that it may
taſte, knowe and diſcerne, how grea
                           •
                        e the
multitude of thy ſweetnes is, o Lord,
which thou haſt kept in ſtore for thē that
are repleniſhed with thy loue. Giue me a
harte (o Lord) that may thinke on thee: a
minde, that may loue thee: a memorie,
that may muſe on thee: an vnderſtanding
that may knowe thee: a will, that may alwaies
be ſtrongly vnited to thee, the cheifeſt
and moſt delightfull good. Graunt
that I may alwaies wiſely and diſcreetely
loue thee.
                     O life, to whom all thinges liue, that life
which giueth me life: that life which is my
life: that life, by which I liue, without
which I die; that life, by which I am rayſed
and reuiued, without which I periſhe and
am conſumed: that life, by which I am cō
                        forted,
without which I am afflicted O liuing
life, ſweete, and worthy to be beloued,
alwaies to be remembred, tell me (I
pray thee) where art thou? Where may I
finde thee, to the end I may leaue my
ſelfe, and liue in thee? Be neere vnto me
in my minde, neere in my harte, neere i
                           •

ſuccoure me in time of affliction: becauſe
I languiſhe through thy loue: becauſe I

die, whenſoeuer I am without thee, and
am rayſed againe to life by thinking on
thee. Thy ſmell recreateth me, thy remembrance
healeth me. Then ſhall I be ſatisfied
and neuer before, when thy glorie (o
life of my ſoule) ſhall appeare.
                     My ſoule greatelie deſireth, and almoſt
fainteth, throughe the remembrance of
thee, when ſhall I come (o my delight) and
be preſented before thee? Why doſt thou
hide away thy face, o my ioy, by which I
reioyce? Where art thou hidden o beautifull
Lord, Whom I ſoe much deſire? I ſmell
the ſweete ſauoure of thee; I liue, and am
delighted in thee, and yet I doe not ſee
thee. I heare thy voyce and am reuiued.
But why doſt thou hide thy face from
me?
                     Peraduenture thou wilt ſay: Man cannot
ſee me and liue. Let me therefore die
o Lord, that I may ſee thee, let me ſee thee
that I may die to the worlde. I doe not deſire
to liue, but to die, for that my deſire
is to be diſſolued, and to be with Chriſt. I
deſire to die, that I may ſee Chriſt; I refuſe
to liu
                           •
                        , to the end I may liue with Chriſt.
O Lord Ieſu receiue my ſpirit, o my life receiue
my ſoule. O my delight drawe my
harte vnto thee. O my delightfull foode,
let me feede on thee. O my heade, vouchſafe
to direct me, o light of mine eies,

enlighten me. O my melodious muſique,
tune and order me. O my ſweete ſmell,
reuiue me. O diuine Worde, recreate me.
O my praiſe, make gladde the ſoule of thy
ſeruant Enter into it, o my ioy, that it may
reioyce in thee. Enter into it, o ſoueraigne
ſweetnes, that it may taſte and ſauoure
thoſe thinges, that are ſweete. O eternall
light, ſhine vppon it▪ that it may vnderſtande,
knowe and loue thee. For this i
                           •
                        
the cauſe, why it doth not loue thee (if it
doth not loue thee) becauſe it doth not
knowe thee: and the cauſe why it doth
not knowe thee, is for that it doth not
vnderſtande thee▪ And the cauſe, why
it doth not vnderſtande thee, is for that it
doth not comprehende thy light, and the
light ſhineth in darknes, and the darkn
                           •
                        s
comprehendeth it not.
                     O light of my m
                           •
                        nde, o bright truthe,
o true charitie, who enlightneſt euery
man comminge into this wor
                           •
                        d

                        e, comminge
I ſay into the wor'd, but not louinge
the worlde, becauſe he that loueth
the worlde, becommeth the ennimy of
God. Expell the darkenes which couereth
the face of the depth of my minde, that
by vnderſtanding, it may ſee thee; that by
ſeinge, it may knowe thee, and by knowing,
may loue thee▪ For whoſoeuer knoweth
thee, loueth thee, and forgetteth

himſelfe: he loueth thee more then himſelfe:
he leaueth himſelfe and commeth to
thee, that he may be delighted in thee.
                     Hence it proceedeth o Lord, that I doe
not loue thee ſoe much as I ought, becauſe
I doe not perfectlie knowe thee, but
becauſe I knowe thee but a little, I loue
thee but a little, and becauſe I loue thee
but a little▪ I am but a little delighted in
thee. Leauing thee therfore the true internall
ioy by louing thinges externall,
aſlong as I wante thee onely, I ſeeke after
falſe freindſhipps in thoſe thinges that are
without me. And by this meanes I haue
applied my harte to thinges that are vaine,
which with all affection and loue I ought
to haue beſtowed on thee alone. And ſoe
by louing vanitie, I my ſelfe am become
vaine.
                     Hence it proceedeth likewiſe o Lord,
that I doe not reioyce in thee, neither doe
I adhere to thee. Becauſe I delight in thinges
temporall, thou in thinges ſpirituall,
my whole minde, thoughtes and wordes
are entangled in thinges tranſitorie, but
thou o Lord, dwelleſt in thinges that endure
for all eternitie, thou thy ſelfe being
eternitie. Thy habitation is in heauen,
mine on the earthe. Thou loueſt thoſe
thinges that are aboue, I thoſe that are
heere beneathe. Thou thoſe that are heauenly▪
                        
I thoſe that are earthly▪ And when
will theſe thinges agree together, that are
ſoe oppoſite one to an other?
                  
                  
                     Of the miſerie and frailtie of man.
CHAPT. II.
                     WRetche that I am, when will my
crowkednes be made correſpondent
to thy righteouſnes? Thou o Lord loueſt
ſolitarines, I to be in the companie of
others. Thou loueſt ſilence, and I talkinge
and diſcourſe. Thou loueſt veritie▪ and I
vanitie. Thou loueſt cleanlines, and I followe
mine owne filthines.
                     What neede I ſay more o Lord? Thou
art truly good, I wicked. Thou art righteous,
I vnrighteous: thou art holy, I wretched▪
thou arti uſt, I vniuſt; thou art light▪
and I am blinde: thou art life, and I am
deade▪ Thou art phiſique, and I am ſicke.
Thou art mirthe, and I am melancholy▪
Thou art the ſupreame veritie, and I am altogether
vanitie, like as euerie man liuing.
What ſhall I then ſay o my Creator? Heare
me o Creator. I am thy creature, I haue
beene forelorne, and gone aſtray; I am
thy creature, and am like to die. I am of
thy making, and am come to nothinge I
am a peece of earthe framed by thee.
                     
                        
Thy handes o Lord haue made me and
faſhioned me: thoſe handes▪ I ſay▪ which
with nayles were faſtned to the croſſe
for me. Looke I beſeeche thee o Lord,
vpon the woundes of thy handes, and
contemne not me the worke of thy handes.
Beholde o Lord my God, thou haſt
writtē me in thy handes, reade that handewriting,
and ſaue me. Behold I ſigh to
thee being thy creature, recreate me being
my Creator. Beholde, I (whom thou haſt
made) doe crie vnto thee, thou that art
life, reuiue me. Beholde I looke towardes
thee being a peece of clay framed by thee;
thou art my maker, repaire me.
                     Pardon me o Lord, for that the dayes of
my life are ſhort, and as it were nothinge.
What is man, that he durſt ſpeake to God
that made him? Pardon me talking vnto
thee. Pardon thy ſeruant preſuming to
ſpeake vnto ſoe greate a Lord. Neceſſi
                           •

to ſpeake: the miſe
                           •
                        ie which I ſuſtaine
conſtraineth me to crie vnto the. Beeing
therfore ſicke, I crie vnto the phiſition▪
being blinde, I haſten vnto the 
                           •
                        ight:
being deade, I ſighe after life. Thou art
my phiſition o Ieſus of Nazareth, thou art
my light, thou art my life. O Sonne of
Dauid take pittie vppon me, o fountaine
of mercie, be mercifull vnto me.

Heare what thy ſicke patient ſaieth vnto
thee. O light▪ which paſſeſt by, expect him
that is blinde: lende him thy hande, that
he may come vnto thee, and in thy light
may ſee light. O liuing life, recall me that
am deade, to life.
                     What am I, that doe ſpeake vnto thee?
Woe be to me o Lord, pardon me o Lord
I am an vnhappie man; A man (I ſay)
borne of a woman, liuinge but a ſhort
time, repleniſhed with many miſeries: a
man (I ſay) become like vnto vanitie, compared
and very well likened vnto ſenſleſſe
bruite beaſtes. Againe, what am I? An
obſcure bottomeleſſe pitt, a clodd of clay,
the ſonne of anger, and perdition: begotten
in filthines, liuing in wretchednes, and
being to die in great anguiſh and diſtreſſe.
                     O wretche, what am I? O miſerable
man▪ what ſhall I be? A veſſel of ordure
and filthines, a receptacle of rottennes, full
of ſtenche and loathſomenes: blinde, needie,
naked, ſubiect to manifolde neceſſities;
ſubiect to miſerie and mortalitie, knowing
neither my beginning, nor my dyinge
day. Whoſe dayes and life paſſe and
vaniſh away as the ſhadow of the Moone;
And as the bloſſomes of a tree growe and
ſodainely wither away, ſoe doth the life
of man now flowriſhe, and forthwith
growe to decay. My life (I ſay) is a life fraile

and brittle, a life, which by how much the
more it encreaſeth, by ſoe much the more
it decreaſeth: by how much the more it
haſtneth on, by ſoe much the more it
draweth neere to deathe, a life deceiptful,
like vnto a ſhadowe.
                     One while I am merrie and gladde, and
preſentlie after ſorrowefull and ſadde.
Sometime ſounde, and then ſodainely
ſicke, now a liue, and in a ſhorte time after
I ſhalbe deade; ſometimes I make a ſhew
as if I were happie, yet ſtill in miſerie; ſometimes
I laughe, and ſodainely after I
lament. And all thinges are ſoe ſubiect to
mutation, as that nothing can be truly
ſaied to remaine ſtable in the ſame ſtate,
one onely hower of time. Sometimes
feare afflicteth vs, at other times ſome ſodaine
chance affrighteth vs: ſometimes
hunger, vexeth vs, at other times thirſt tormenteth
vs: ſometimes heate parcheth vs,
at other times colde pincheth vs: ſometimes
ſicknes; moleſteth vs, at other times
ſadnes d

                        cteth vs.
                     After theſe followeth deathe before he
is expected, bereauing wretched men by a
thouſande meanes dayly of theire liues,
and taking them on a ſodaine before they
be prepared. One dieth of a feauer, an
other throughe ſorrowe, one fainteth and
falleth downe deade through hunger, an

other through thirſt: one is drowned, an
other hanged: one is burned, an other with
the teethe of wilde beaſtes, is torne in
pceces and deuoured. One is ſlaine with
the ſworde, an other poyſoned, an other
dieth being by ſome ſoddaine accident
onely affrighted. And yet a greater miſerie
then all theſe, is, that albeit nothing is
more certaine then deathe, yet man
knoweth not the time of his deathe; and
when he thinketh to ſtande moſt firme,
he is ouerthrowne, and all his hopes come
to nothinge. Becauſe man knoweth not
when, nor where, nor how he ſhall
die, althoughe it be a thinge aſſured, that
he muſt die.
                     Beholde o Lord how greate mans miſerie
is, in which I am, and yet I am voide
of feare: Beholde how greate the calamitie
is, which I ſuſtaine, and yet I am voide
of ſorrowe, and doe not crie to thee. I will
crie vnto thee, o Lord, before I paſſe out
of this life, to the end my paſſage may be
nothing els, but to remaine perpetuallie
with thee. I will therfore make knowne
and diſcouer my wretchednes. I will confeſſe
and will not be aſhamed to diſcloſe
my vildenes. Helpe me, o my force, by
whom I am vphelde; ſuccoure me o my
ſtrength, by whom I ſuſtained; come o
light, by which I ſee; appeare o glorie, by

which I reioyce, apppeare o life, in which
I may liue, eternallie bleſſed, cuen thou o
Lord my God.
                  
                  
                     Of the admirable light of God.
CHAPT. III.
                     O Light, which ould Tobias being
blinde, did ſee, when he taught his
ſonne the way of life. That light, which
Iſaac (albeit his corporall eies failled him)
ſawe within him, when outwardlye he
foretolde to this ſonne thinges that were
to come. That inuiſible light (I ſay) that
ſeethe plainely the vnſpeakeable depthe
of mans harte. That light which lacob did

                        e euents
to his children, according to that, which
thou didſt inwardly dictate vnto him Beholde
(o Lord) darknes doth ouerſhadowe
the face of the bottomleſſe depth of my
minde, thou art light. Beholde an obſcure
miſt doth ouerwhelme the waters of my
harte thou art the truthe.
                     O Worde, by which all thinges were
made, and without which was made nothing.
That Worde, which is before all
thinges, and before which, there was nothinge.
That Worde, which gouerneth all
thinges, without which all thinges are nothing

That Worde, which in the beginning
haſt ſaied; Let light be made, and it
was donne. Say likewiſe to me, let light
be made, and let it be donne, and let me
ſee the light, and knowe whatſoeuer is
not light, becauſe without thee, darknes
wil be vnto me as light, and light as darkneſſe.
And ſoe without thy light there is
noe veritie; there is nothing els but errour
and vanitie: there is confuſion, and noe
diſcretion, there is ignorance, and noe
knowledge; blindenes, and noe ſeeing:
going aſtray, and noe walking in the right
way: deathe, and noe life.
                  
                  
                     Of the mortalitie of mans nature.
CHAPT. IV.
                     BEholde o Lord, where light is abſent,
there deathe is preſent: nay deathe is
not there preſent, becauſe deathe is meerelie
nothinge. For by deathe we tende to
nothinge, whilſt by ſinne we feare to doe
nothing. And truly o Lord, this iuſtlie hapneth
vnto vs, for we receiue according to
our actions, whiles (like a flowinge riuer)
we runne, and come to nothinge: becauſe
without thee, there is made nothing,
and we by doing nothing, come to be
nothinge: For without thee we are

nothing, by whom all thinges are made,
without whom there is made nothing.
                     O Lord God, thou diuine Worde, by
whom all thinges are made, without whō
is made nothing. Woe is me poore wretche
ſoe often blinded and depriued of
ſight, for that I want thee, being the true
light. Woe is me poore wretche ſoe often
wounded, for that I want thee the ſoueraigne
ſalue, by which we are cured. Woe
is me poore wretche ſoe often deceiued,
for that I want thee, being the truthe by
which we are directed. Woe is me poore
wretche ſoe often going aſtray, for that I
want thee, who art the true way. Woe is
me poore wretche ſoe often deade, for
that I want thee, who art the life by whō
we are reuiued. Woe is me poore wretche
ſoe often brought to nothing, becauſe
thou art the diuine Worde, by whom all
thinges are made, & I want thee, without
whom nothing is made.
                     O Lord God, thou diuine Worde, who
art the light, by whom light was made,
who art the way, the truth and the life, in
whom there is nether darknes, error, vanitie,
nor death. Thou art the light, without
which darknes blindeth vs; thou art the
way, without which error deceiueth vs;
thou art the veritie, without which vanitie
allureth and deludeth vs, thou art the

life, without which death vanquiſheth vs.
Say the worde (o Lord) let light be made,
that I may ſee the light, and eſchewe darkenes;
that I may ſee the way, and ſhunne
error; that I may ſee the veritie, and auoid

                     Enlighten me o Lord and my light, my
light and ſaluation, whom I will feare:
my Lord, whom I will prayſe: my God,
whom I will honor: my Father, whom I
will loue; my bridegroome, to whom and
for whom onely I will liue. Enlighten me
o Lord and my light, enlighten me (I ſay)

and in the ſhadowe of deathe, and
guide my feete into the way of peace, by
which I may enter into the place of thy
glorious tabernacle, euen into the houſe

                     What it is to become nothing.
CHAPT. V.
                     I will therfore make knowne and confeſſe
my miſerie vnto thee, o father

Lord of heauen and earthe. Becauſe I am
become wretched, and as one turned to
nothing, and I knewe it not: becauſe I
wanted thee, who art the truth. My ſinnes
wounded me, and I felt it not, becauſe I
wanted thee, that art my life. They
brought me to nothing, becauſe I wanted
thee, who art the Worde, by whom all
thinges are made, without whom nothing
is made; Being therfore without thee, I
became nothing, becauſe that is nothing,
that bringeth vs to nothing. All thinges
that were made, were made by thy
Worde: But how were they made? God
behelde all thinges he had made, and they
were exceeding good. All thinges therfore
that are made, are made by the Worde,
and all thinges that are made by the
Worde, are exceeding good. Whie are
they good? Becauſe all thinges are made
by the Worde, and without it is made
nothing, for that there is nothing good,
which proceedeth not from God the ſupreame
good.
                     Contrarie wiſe, that is euill, which containeth
in it ſelfe noe good, and this euill
is a meere nothing, for that euill is nothing
els, but the want of good, euen as blindenes
is nothing els, but the want of
ſight Euill therefore is a meere nothing,
becauſe it is made without the Worde,

without which, there is made nothinge.
And that is to be accompted euill, which
wanteth that good, by which all thinges
whaſoeuer are made. But thoſe thinges
that are not, are not made by him, and
conſequentlie they are nothing. This therfore
is the cauſe, why thoſe thinges are
euill, which are not made, becauſe all thinges,
whatſoeuer are made, are made by
the Worde, and all thinges that are made
by the Worde, are good. And ſithence all
thinges that are made, are made by the
Worde, thoſe thinges, that are euill, are
not made by him.
                     It remaineth therefore, that all thinges,
that are not made, are not good, becauſe
all thinges, that are made, are good: whēce
it followeth, that thoſe thinges are euill,
which are not made, and conſequentlie
are nothing, becauſe without the Worde
there is made nothing. Euill therfore is
nothing, becauſe it is not made. What is
it then, if it be not made? Surelie nothing
els but the priuation, and want of that
good, by which good is made. Wherfore
to be without the Worde is euill, which
cannot properly be fared to be, becauſe
without the Worde there is nothing.
                     But what is it to be ſeparated from the
Worde? If you deſire to knowe this, heare
firſt what the Worde is. The diuine worde

ſaieth of himſelfe, I am the way, the truth,
and the life. To be ſeparated therfore frō
the Worde, is to be without the way, the
truth, and the life, & therfore to be without
him, is to be nothing, and conſequentlye
euill, becauſe it is ſeparated from the
Worde, by which all thinges were made
exceeding good. To be ſeparated therfore
from the Worde, by which all thinges
were made, is nothing els, but to ceaſe to
be, and returne to nothing, becauſe without
the worde there is nothing; wherfore
as often as thou doſt ſwarue from that
which is good, thou doſt ſeperate thy ſelfe
from the Worde (which is the true good)
and ſoe thou becommeſt nothing, becauſe
thou art without the Worde, without
which there is made nothing.
                     Beholde (o Lord) thou haſt enlightned
me, to the end, I might beholde thee, by
which meanes▪ I haue ſeene and knowen
my ſelfe: being now aſſured, that as often
as I haue been ſeperated from thee, I haue
become nothing, becauſe I haue forgotten
thee the onely true good, and ſoe by
that meanes haue become euill. Poore
wretche that I am, how came it to paſſe,
that I did not knowe eare this time, that
forſaking thee, I became nothing? But
why doe I demaunde that queſtion? For
how coulde I deſire to knowe thee, if I

was nothing? We knowe full well, that
euill is nothing, and that which is nothing
hath noe being, that likewiſe which is not
good, hath noe being, becauſe it is nothing.
If therfore I was nothing, when I
was without thee, I was as nothing, and
like vnto an image or idoll, which is nothing:
which hath cares and heareth not;
noſtrills and ſmelleth not, which hath
eies, and ſeeth not, which hath a mouth,
and ſpeaketh not: which hath handes, and
handeleth not; which hath feete and walketh
not, and finally hath the forme and
ſhape of the members of a man, without
the vſe and feeling of them.
                  
                  
                     Of the miſerable estate of the ſoule
being in ſinne.
CHAPT. VI.
                     AS long therfore as I was without
thee, I was not, for that I was nothing,
and therfore I was blinde, deafe, and
vnſenſible, becauſe I did neither diſcerne
what was good, not ſhunne that which
was euill: neither did I feele the greife of
the woundes which I receiued, nor ſee
the darknes, in which I liued: and the reaſon
was, for that I was without thee the
true light, enlightning euerie man coming

into this worlde. They haue wounded me
(alas) and I haue not greiued; they haue
violently drawen me, and I haue not felt
it: becauſe I was nothinge, for that I was
without life, to witt the diuine Worde, by
which were made all thinges.
                     For this cauſe o Lord, and my light,
mine enimies haue donne to me whatſoeuer
they woulde, yea they haue ſtriken
and ſtripped me, they haue defiled and
depraued me, they haue wounded, and
killed me, becauſe I departed from thee,
and became as nothing without thee.
Woe is me o Lord and my life, who haſt
made me, woe is me my light, who haſt
directed me. O Lord my God defender of
my life, take pittie of me, and raiſe me frō
deathe for thou art my hope, my ſtrenght,
my force, and my comfort in time of aduerſitie,
beholde mine ennimies, and deliuer
me.
                     Let thoſe that hate me, flie before me,
and lett me liue in thee by thee. For they
(o Lord) behelde me, and ſeeing me without
thee, they haue deſpiſed me. They
haue deuided amonge them, the garmēts
of vertues, with which thou hadſt adorned
me, th
                           •
                        y haue made as it were theire highe

                           •
                        ode way, paſſing to and fro ouer me, and
treading me vnder theire feete, they haue
defiled thy holy temple, leauing me deſolate,

and oppreſſed with greife. I went after
them being blinde and naked, and intangled
in the ropes of ſinnes: they drewe
me rounde about after them from one
ſinne into an other, and from one filthines
into an other, and I went (as one driuen)
before thē, hauing not the force to withſtande
them I was a ſlaue, and ſlauerie was
pleaſing vnto me. I was blinde, and blindnes
was delightfull vnto me; I was boūde,
neither did I abhorre my bandes; I thought
ſoure to be ſweete, and ſweete to be ſower.
I was wretched and in miſerie, and I
knewe it not:
                     And the reaſon was, becauſe I was without
the Worde without which was made nothing,
by which al thinges are preſerued, &
without which all thinges returne to nothing.
For as by him al thinges were made,
and without him was made nothinge:
euen ſoe by him al thinges are preſerued,
that are contained either in heauen, or in
earthe, or in the ſea, or in the bottomleſſe
depthe. Neither woulde one parte ſtick to
an other in a ſtone, or in any other thinge
created, if they were not preſerued by the
Worde, by which al thinges were framed.
                     Let me therefore ſtick & adhere to thee
o diuine Worde; for that as often as I
haue wandered away from thee, I ſhould
haue withered away in my ſelfe, if thou

(who didſt firſt create me) hadſt not recreated
me. I haue ſinned, and thou haſt
viſited me. I haue fallen, and thou haſt raiſed
me. I haue been ignorant, & thou haſt
taught me. I haue been blinde, and thou
haſt enlightned me.
                  
                  
                     Of the manifolde benefits of almightie
God. CHAPT. VII.
                     O My God, graunt that I vnworthy
wretch may ſee, how much I am
bounde to loue thee. Graunt that I may
ſee, how I am bounde to praiſe thee Graūt
that I may ſee, how much I am bounde to
pleaſe thee.
                     Thunder (o Lord) from aboue with a
greate and ſtronge voice, into the internall
care of my harte; teache me and ſaue me,
and I will praiſe thee: who when I was
nothing, haſt created me; who, when I
I was in darknes, haſt enlightned me; who,
when I was deade, haſt raiſed me; who
with all manner of good thinges from my
very youthe, haſt fed and refreſhed me;
nouriſhing me with thy greateſt guiftes
and graces, being a poore vnprofitable
worme ſtinking through the abomination
of mine iniquities.
                     
                        
Open vnto me (o key of Dauid) who openeſt,
and noe man ſhutteth againſt him, to
whom thou openeſt: who ſhutteth, and
noe man openeth to him, againſt whom
thou ſhutteſt: open vnto me, the doore
of thy light, that I may enter in and ſee,
and knowe, and with my whole hart confeſſe
vnto thee, for that thy mercy towardes
me is greate, and thou haſt deliuered
my ſoule from the loweſt hell.
                     O Lord our God, how wonderfull and
worthy to be praiſed is thy name in the
whole worlde! What is man (o Lord) that
thou art mindfull of him, or the ſonne of
man, that thou viſiteſt him? O Lord the
hope of good men, and theire towne of
defenſe. O God the life of my ſoule, by
which I liue, without which I dy. O light
of mine eies, by which I ſee, without
which I am blinde. O ioy of mine harte,
and comfort of my ſoule, graunt that I
may loue thee with all my harte, and with
all my minde, and with all the force and
ſtrenght that I haue, becauſe thou haſt
loued me firſt.
                     And whence hapneth this vnto me, o
Creator of heau
                           •
                        n, earthe and of the bottomleſſe
depthe, who needeſt not my
goodes? Whence hapneth this vnto me,
that thou ſhouldeſt in this ſorte loue me?
O diuine wiſedome, who openeſt the

mouthes of thoſe that are dumbe. O diuine
Worde, by which all thinges were
made. Open my mouth, giue me wordes
of thanksgiuinge, that I may rehearſe all
the benefitts, which thou haſt beſtowed
vpon me from the beginning.
                     Beholde I confeſſe therefore, to haue
receiued my being from thee; becauſe
thou haſt created me, and haſt preordained
to create me, and to nomber me amonge
thy creatures from all eternitie, yea from
the beginning, and before thou madeſt
any thinge, before thou didſt extende
the heauens, before the bottomeles depthes
had theire being, before the worlde
was fram d, before the mountaines or
hills were founded, before riuers flowed:
before thou didſt make any of thoſe thinges,
which thou haſt made by thy worde,
thou didſt foreſee by the infallible prouidence
of thy truth, that I ſhould be thy
creature, preordaining ſoe of me by thy
diuine pleaſure.
                     What hath cauſed thee to doe this for
me (o moſt louing Lord) moſt glorious
God, moſt mercifull Father, moſt powerfull
and for euer moſt pittifull creator?
What meritts of mine, what grace did
deſerue the ſame? that it ſhould pleaſe thy
diuine maieſty ſoe gratiouſly to create me?
                     Thou haſt created me, when I had noe

being, and of nothing thou haſt made me
ſomething: But what ſomething? Surely
not water, nor fire, not a foule, or a fiſh, not
a ſerpent, or any bruite beaſte, not a ſtone,
or a peace of timber, not of thoſe kinde
of creatures, which haue nothing els but
theire being, no
                           •
                         of thoſe, which be, and
growe onely. Not of that ſorte which be,
growe, and haue feeling onely; but ſurpaſſing
all theſe, it hath pleaſed thee to make
me of the nomber of thoſe, which be onely,
for that I am; and of the nomber of
thoſe, which be, and growe onely, for that
I am, and doe growe; and of the nomber
of thoſe, which be, doe growe, and haue
feeling, becauſe I am▪ doe growe, and haue
feeling, yea thou haſt created me almoſt
equall to the Angells, becauſe I haue receiued
from thee common with them, the
guift of reaſon, wherby to knowe thee.
                     Neuertheleſſe I haue ſaied (almoſt
equall) for that they alreadie haue the happie
knowledge of thee, by ſeeing thee as
thou art, but I by hope onely. They, by beholding
thee apparantlie face to face. I
ob
                           •
                        curelie as it were in a looking glaſſe:
They plainelie and perfectlie, but I partlie
onely.
                  
                  
                     
                     Of the future dignitie of man.
CHAPT. VIII.
                     WHen that therfore which is perfect is
arriued, that which is partly onely
ſhalbe diſanulled, which will be, when we
ſhall be admitted to beholde thy face apparentlie.
What will then hinder vs to
be almoſt equall to the Angells? whom
thou (o Lord) at that time wilt crowne
with a crowne of hope, which is adorned
with glorie and renowne: whom thou
with vnſpeakeable fauoures wilt grace
as thy friends, yea we ſhalbe in all thinges
like, and equall to the Angells. Thy truth
doth likewiſe teſtifie the ſame, ſaying;
They are equall to the Angells, and are
the ſonnes of God. What are they but
the ſonnes of God, if they are equall to the
Angells? They ſhall without doubt be the
ſonnes of God, becauſe the ſonne of man
is become the ſonne of God.
                     Through this conſideration I durſt boldlye
affirme, that man is not onely almoſt
equall to the Angells, noe not equall onely,
but higher in dignitie and ſurpaſſing
the Angells, becauſe man is God, and God
is man, not an Angell. Wherfore I durſt
auouche, that man is the moſt excellent of

all creatures: becauſe the Worde, which in
the beginning was God with God; the
Worde, by which God ſayed: let light be
made, and light was made, to witt, the Angelicall
nature; the Worde, by which God
in the beginning created all thinges, the
ſame Worde hath become fleſhe, and
dwelt in vs, and we haue ſeene the glory
of it. Loe this is the glorie, by which I glorie,
whenſoeuer I glorie, as I ought. Loe
this is the ioy, by which I reioyce, whenſoeuer
I reioyce as I ſhoulde, euen thou o
Lord my God, the life, and onely glorie of
my ſoule.
                     I confeſſe therfore vnto thee (o Lord
my God) that thou haſt created me, in a
manner equal to the Angells, in that thou
haſt created me capable of reaſon: for that
by meanes of thy diuine Worde, I am in
poſſibilitie to become equall to the Angells,
that by meanes of thy onely begotten
Worde, I may be adopted to be thy
ſonne (o Lord) to be thy ſonne I ſay, by
the meanes and merits of thy beloued
ſonne leſus Chriſt, in whom thou haſt
beene well pleaſed, being thy onely ſōne,
and heare, and our onely Lord and redeemer,
enligthner, and comforter: being our
aduocate with thee, and the light of our
eies; who is our life, our Sauiour, and our
onely hope, who hath loued vs more then

himſelfe, by whom we haue an aſſured
truſt and confidence, and acceſſe to come
to thee, becauſe he hath giuē them power
to be the ſonnes of God, that beleiue in
his name.
                     I will for euer o Lord, praiſe thy holy
name, who by creating me according to
thine owne image and likenes, haſt made
me capable of ſoe greate glorie, as to be
the ſonne of God.
                     The trees, ſtones, and all thinges els
whatſoeuer, that are mou

                        d, or growe, in

                           •
                        ledge and prerogatiue;
becauſe thou haſt not giuen them power
by meanes of thy Worde, to be the ſonnes
of God, for that they are dep
                           •
                        iued of reaſon,
becauſe this power doth depende of
the reaſon, by which we knowe God. But
he hath giuen this power to men, whom
he hath created reaſonable according to
his owne image and likenes. And I (o
Lord) like as by thy grace I am a man, ſoe
likewiſe by thy grace, I am in poſſibilitie
to be thy ſonne, which is a prerogatiue
which they cannot attaine vnto.
                     Whence proceedeth this ſoe greate a
good vnto me o Lord, the moſt ſoueraigne
truth, and true ſoueraigntie, the origina
                           •
                        l
and beginning of all creatures? What is
the cauſe heereof o Lord, that I ſhoulde

be able to become thy ſonne, and they
cannot? Thou art the cauſe (o Lord) who
remaineſt for euer, who haſt created aſwell
the one as the other. Thou haſt created
both men and beaſtes, the ſtones, and
the greene graſſe growing on the groūde.
There were not any precedent meritts or
precedent grace, becauſe thou haſt created
all thinges, being moued there vnto by
thy onely goodnes. All creatures before
theire creation were equall in meritts, for
that they were all voide of merits.
                     What then hath cauſed, thy goodnes
to be more liberall towardes me thy creature,
whom thou haſt endewed with reaſon,
then towardes all others that are
voide of the ſame? Why am not I like
vnto all them, or all they like vnto me, or
I alone like vnto them? What merits of
mine, what grace or goodnes was there
in me to deſerue the ſame? to witt, that
thou ſhouldeſt make me capable to be the
ſonne of God, which prerogatiue thou haſt
graunted to none of them? Be it farr, o
Lord, from mine imagination, that I
ſhoulde thinke this to proceede from any
merits of mine. Thy onely grace and
goodnes hath been the cauſe of this, to
the end I might be pertaker of the ſweetnes
thereof.
                     I beſeeche thee therefore by that grace,

by the which thou haſt created me,
that thou wilt giue me grace, to the end I
may be gratefull for this grace receiued
from thee.
                  
                  
                     Of Gods omnipotent power.
CHAPT. IX.
                     THy omnipotent hande (o God) being
ſtill one and the ſame, hath created
Angells in heauen, and wormes on the
earth, not being more excellent in the creation
of the firſt, then of the later. For as
noe other hande coulde create an Angell:
ſoe noe other coulde create a worme. As
noe other coulde create heauen: ſoe noe
other coulde create the leaſt leafe of a
tree. As noe other coulde create the body,
ſoe noe other coulde cauſe ſoe much as
one haire of the heade to be either white,
or blacke. But the omnipotent hande of
thy maieſtie createth all thinges with a
like facilitie. Neither is it more poſſible
vnto it to create a worme, then an Angell,
nor more inpoſſible to inlarge the heauēs
then a leafe: it is not more eaſie vnto it to
make a haire, then a body: nor more harde
to lay the foundation of the earthe vpon
the waters, then the foundation of the
waters vpon the earthe. But all thinges,

whatſoeuer it woulde, it hath made (as it
woulde) in heauen, and in earthe, in the
ſea, and in the bottomeles depthes, making
me likewiſe amongſt all other thinges,
euen as it would, could, and knewe
how.
                     Veriely thy hande (o Lord) coulde haue
made me a ſtone, or a birde, or a ſerpent,
or ſome brute beaſte; knowing full well
how to doe it, yet woulde not, by reaſon
of thy great goodnes. The cauſe therefore,
why I am not a ſtone, or a tree, or ſome
brute beaſte, is, for that thy goodnes hath
otherwiſe ordained, neither were there
any precedent merits of mine, that might
claime the ſame.
                  
                  
                     Of the incomprehenſible prayſe
of God.
CHAPT. X.
                     WHat hath cauſed thee (o Lord) to be
ſoe good and gratious vnto me, and
how ſhall I be able worthily to prayſe
thee? For as thou haſt made me without
me, according as it hath pleaſed thee, ſoe
likewiſe thou art prayſed without me,
euen as it pleaſeth thee. Thou (o Lord) art
thine owne prayſe. Let thy workes prayſe
thee, o Lord, according to the multitude

of thy greatenes, albeit thy prayſe be incomprehenſible.
It cannot be conceiued in
thought, nor expreſſed with wordes, nor
perceiued by the hearing, becauſe theſe
are tranſitorie and fleeting, but thy praiſe
is eternall and euerlaſting.
                     The thought hath his beginning and
likewiſe his ending, the voyce yeild 
                           •

forth a ſounde, and the ſounde ſodainelie
paſſeth away: the eare heareth, and the
hearing quickly ceaſeth without making
any long ſtay: but thy praiſe endureth
perpetually.
                     Who then can worthily praiſe thee? or
what man is able to expr
                           •
                        ſſe thy praiſe,
ſeeing thy praiſe is not tranſitorie, but
durable for all eternitie? That man praiſeth
thee, that beleiueth thee to be thine
owne praiſe That man praiſeth thee, that
acknowledgeth that he is vnable to expreſſe
thy praiſe. In thee (o Lord) is our
praiſe (who art that praiſe that endureth
alwaies) in thee ſhall my ſoule be praiſed.
                     We (o Lord) doe not praiſe thee, but
thou thy ſelfe, prayſeſt thy ſelfe, both by
thy ſelf, & in thy ſelfe, & we likewiſe haue
praiſe in thee. Then haue we true praiſe,
when we receiue praiſe frō thee, whē the
light aproueth the light, becauſe thou, that
art the true light, giueſt true praiſe. As often
therfore as we ſeeke praiſe and commendation

from any other ſauing from
thee, ſoe often we looſe thy praiſe, becāuſe
that praiſe paſſeth away, but thine endureth
for all eternitie. If we ſeeke tranſitorie
praiſe, we looſe that which endureth
alwaies: If therfore we deſire to obtaine
that praiſe which is euerlaſting, let vs not
loue that which is tranſitorie & fleeting.
                     O Lord my God the eternall praiſe,
from whom proceedeth all praiſe, and
without whom there is noe praiſe. I am
not able to prayſe thee without thee; let
me poſſeſſe thee, and I will prayſe thee.
For what am I (o Lord) of my ſelfe, that
I ſhoulde praiſe thee? Verily I am nothing
elſe but duſt, and aſhes, a deade dogge
turned into carion, a worme, and meere
corruption. What am I (o Lord God
moſt powerfull, the breathe and life
of euery liuing creature) that I ſhoulde
prayſe thee, whoſe dwelling is eternitie?
                     Shall darknes praiſe the light, or death
life? Thou art the light, I am darknes: thou
art life, I am deathe. Shall vanitie prayſe
veritie? Thou art veritie, and I am a man
wholy addicted to vanitie. How then
ſhall I be able (o Lord) to prayſe thee?
Shall my miſerie prayſe thee? Shall that
which ſtinketh, prayſe that which is
ſweete? Shall mans mortalitie (which

is to day, and is gone to morrowe) prayſe
thee? Shall man preſume to prayſe thee
being but rottennes and corruption, and
the ſonne of man, being but a worme?
Shall he preſume to prayſe thee, that is
begotten, borne, and brought vp in ſinne
and iniquitie? Verily thy prayſe doth not
ſeeme faire and commendable in the
mouthe of him, whoſe life is abominable.
                     Let thy incomprehenſible power therfore
(o Lord my God) prayſe thee, let thy
boundleſſe wiſedome, and vnſpeakeable
goodnes prayſe thee. Let thy ſupereminent
clemencie, and ſuperabundant mercie
prayſe thee. Let thy ouerlaſting vertue
& diuinitie prayſe thee. Let thy moſt omnipotent
power, and thy ſurpaſſing greate
liberalitie and loue (by which thou haſt
created vs) prayſe thee, o Lord God the
verie life of my ſoule.
                  
                  
                     Of the hope, which we ought to haue in God.
CHAPT. XI.
                     BVt I (o Lord) that am thy creature,
being placed vnder the ſhadowe of
thy winges, will put my truſt in thy goodnes,
by which thou haſt created me. Permit
not that to periſh through my malice.

which it hath pleaſed thee to make
through thy greate goodnes. Permit not
that to periſh through my miſerie, which
that haſt vouchſafed to create through thy
ſurpaſſing greate mercy. For what profit
is there in my creation, if I ſhall deſcende
into corruption?
                     Haſt thou (o God) in vaine created all
the children of men? Thou o Lord haſt
created me, gouerne that which thou haſt
created. Deſpiſe not I beſeeche thee the
workes of thy handes. Thou haſt made me
of nothinge; if thou (o Lord) doe not gouerne
me, I ſhall againe returne to nothing.
For like as, when I was nothing of
my ſelfe, thou haſt made me of nothing,
ſoe, it thou doe not gouerne me, I ſhall
againe of my ſelfe returne to nothing.
                     Helpe me (o Lord) and my life, that I
may not periſhe through my wickednes.
If thou (o Lord) hadſt not created me, I
were nothing, now (for that thou haſt
created me) I am ſomething. If thou doe
not gouerne me, I ſhall ceaſe to be ſomething,
and returne to nothing. For neither
my merits, nor any ſpeciall grace in me,
haue compelled thee to create me, but thy
gratious goodnes and mercie. Let the
ſame loue of thine (o Lord my God) which
hath heeretofore enforced thee to create
me, enforce thee now likewiſe to gouerne

me. For what doth it profit me, that thy
charitie hath conſtrained thee to create
me, if I periſhe in my miſery, and thy right
hande doe not rule me?
                     Let this thy clemencie (o Lord my God)
enforce thee to ſaue that which is created,
which hath enforced thee to create that
which was vncreated. Let that charitie
cauſe thee to ſaue me, which hath cauſed
thee to create me; being it is no leſſe now,
then it was then, thou thy ſelfe being that
charitie, who art ſtill the ſame.
                     Thy hande (o Lord) is not growne ſhort
that it canot helpe me, neither thy eare
become ſhort, that it cannot heare me; but
my ſinnes haue made a diuiſion betweene
me▪ and thee, betweene darknes and light,
betweene the image of death, and life,
betweene vanitie and veritie, betweene
this life of mine, which changeth as the
moone, and that of thine, which is ſtill
the fame.
                  
                  
                     Of the ſnares of concupiſcence.
CHAPT. XII.
                     THeſe are the ſhadowes of darknes,
with which I am ouerwhelmed in
the bottomeles dongeon of this obſcure
priſon, in which I lie proſtrate groueling

on the grounde, vntill the day appeare, and
the ſhadowes be departed, and light be
made in the firmament of thy vertue.
                     Let the voyce of our Lord with power
and magnificence pronounce ſaying: Let
light be made, and let the darknes be diſperſed,
let the drie lande likewiſe appeare,
and let the earthe bring forth greene hearbes,
producing the ſeede and good fruite
of the iuſtice of thy kingdome.
                     O Lord my father and God, the life, by
which all thinges liue; and without which
all thinges are to be accompted as deade,
permit me not to linger in lewde thoughtes,
and deliuer me from proude and loftie
lookes, Take from me all carnall cōcupiſcence,
and ſuffer me not to be of a bold &
boaſting minde, but poſſeſſe my harte, that
it may alwaies thinke of thee.
                     Enlighten the eies of mine vnderſtanding
that they may ſee thee, & not be exalted
in thy preſence o glorie euerlaſting)
but let them thinke humbly, not looking
ouer curiouſly on thoſe wonderfull thinges,
that are aboue them. Let them looke
vppon thoſe thinges, that are on the right
hande, and not vpon thoſe on the left, that
are diſpleaſing vnto thee. Let thy eie-lidds
likewiſe guide my footeſtepps, for that
thy eie-lidds looke into the actions and
thoughtes of the ſonnes of men.
                     
                        
Breake and bruiſe my vnlawefull luſte
with thy ſweetenes, which thou haſt reſerued
for thoſe that feare thee, to the end
I may with an eternall deſire couet thee;
leaſt my internall taſte (being through
vanities entſeed and deceaued) eſteeme
bitter to be ſweete, and ſweete to be bitter,
darkenes, to be light, and light to be
darkenes, that I may eſcape free from ſuch
a multitude of ſnares (wherewith all the
worlde is repleniſhed) which our ghoſtly
ennimic hath placed in the way of this
life that we are to walke in, therby to enſnare
the ſoules of ſuch as ſinne. Which
he that ſaw it, omitted not to tell vs of,
ſaying: Whatſoeuer is in the worlde, is
either the concupiſcence of the eies, concupiſcence
of the fleſh, or pride of life.
                     Beholde o Lord my God, the whole
worlde is full of the ſnares of concupiſcences,
which my ghoſtly ennimies haue
prepared to intrappe me in, and who ſhall
be able to auoide them? Verily he, from
whom thou ſhalt take away the concupiſcence
of the eies, leaſt the concupiſcence
of the eies doe entrappe him, from
whom thou ſhalt take away the concupiſcence
of the fleſh, leaſt the concupiſcence
of the fleſhe entice him, and from whom
thou ſhalt take away a bolde and boasting
minde, leaſt pride of life, doe craftely

deceaue him. O how happie is he, to whō
thou ſhalt afforde this 
                           •
                        auoure, becauſe
ſuch a one ſhall paſſe without danger!
                     Wherfore I beſeeche thee for thine
owne ſake (o my Redeemer) that thou
wilt helpe me, that I may not fall in the
ſight of mine aduerſaries, being taken in
the ſnares, which they haue prepared to
entrap my feete, therby to ouerthrowe
my ſoule: but deliuer me (o ſtrength of
my ſaluation) leaſt thine ennimies, which
hate thee, haue me in deriſion.
                     Ariſe o Lord my God (thou that art my
fortitude) and let thine ennimies be diſperſed,
let thoſe that hate thee, fly before
thee: yea like as waxe melteth away before
the face of the fire, euen ſoe let ſinners
conſume in thy ſight: But let me remaine
ſafe, being hidden in the ſecret
place of thy preſence, where abounding
with all good thinges, I may reioyce in the
companie of thy children.
                     Liſten o Lord God vnto the crie of thy
children (who art a father to the fatherleſſe,
and a mother to ſuch as are in diſtreſſe)
and ſtretch for the thy winges, that
we may flie vnder them from the face of
our aduerſarie. O tower of the fortreſſe of
Iſrael, who wilt neither ſlumber nor ſleepe
garding and defending Iſrael, for that the
ennimie doth neither ſlumber not ſleepe,

that oppoſeth Iſrael.
                  
                  
                     Of the miſeries of man, and the manifolde
benefits of almighty God.
CHAPT. XIII.
                     O Light, not ſeene by any other light,
o brightnes, not behelde by any
other brightnes; That light that darkneth
all other light, that brightnes, that maketh
dimme all externall brightnes,
                     O light from which all light is deriued,
o brightnes, from which all brightnes
doth proceede; that brightnes, in compariſon
of which, all brightnes is but dimnes,
all light but darknes. That light, in
whoſe preſence, all dimnes is turned into
brightnes, all darknes into light.
                     O ſupreme light, by noe cloude enclouded,
by noe miſt diminiſhed, by noe darknes
darkned, by noe obſtacle encloſed, by
noe ſhadowe ſeuered and deuided.
                     O light, which enlightneſt all thinges
wholy, together, ſeuerally, and for euer,
let me be abſorpt by thee into the bottō
                        leſſe
depth of thy brightnes, that on euerie
ſide I may ſee thee in thee, and me in
thee, and all thinges vnder thee.
                     Forſake me not (o Lord I beſeeche thee)
leaſt the darknes of my ignorance and

ſinne increaſe. Verilie without thee all
thinges are darknes, and ſinne vnto me,
becauſe nothing is good without thee,
the true, ſole, and ſoueraigne good. I confeſſe
and acknowledge, o Lord my God,
that whereſoeuer I am without thee, it
fareth not well with me, neither without
nor within me, becauſe without thee (o
my God) I eſteeme plentie to be pouertie.
I ſhall then be content and not before, to
wit when thy glorie ſhall appeare.
                     Giue me grace likewiſe, o Lord, who
art my onely felicitie, that I may confeſſe
my miſerie vnto thee; I confeſſe therefore,
that as longe as the multiplicitie of
temporall affaires did diſperſe and deuide
me (following my ſenſualitie) from one
thinge into many, to wit, from the ſupreame
and onely good, that is frō the vnitie
of thy goodnes; ſoe longe I had painefull
plentie and plentifull pouertie, pourſuing
many thinges, and finding content in
none, for that I founde not thee with in
me, the aſſured, ſingular, inſeparable and
ſole good, which hauing now gotten, I
am noe more ſubiect to neede: which hauing
obtained I am now no more payned
and greiued, which hauing now in poſſeſſion,
my whole deſire is ſatisfied.
                     This is a miſerie (me thinke) aboue
other miſeries to be lamented, to ſee how

my miſerable ſoule doth forſake and abandon
thee, in whoſe company ſhee is alwaies
riche and gladde, and adhereth to
the worlde, with whom ſhee is alwaies
poore and fadde. The worlde crieth vnto
vs ſaying, I fade, and thou (o Lord) calleſt
vnto vs, ſaying, I feede; and yet notwithſtanding
ſuch is my peruerſe miſerie, that
it maketh choice rather to followe him
that fadeth, then him that feedeth me.
                     This is my infirmitie and diſeaſe. Cure
the ſame (o Phiſition of our ſoules) to the
end I may with my whole harte acknowledge
vnto thee (o Sauiour of my ſoule)
the manifold benefits, with which thou
haſt nouriſhed me from my tender youth,
vntill theſe my ould and laſt decrepit
yeares.
                     For thine owne ſake (o Lord) I beſeeche
thee, not to forſake me: when I was nothing,
thou haſt created me, when I was
conſumed through ſinne, thou haſt redeemed
me, when I was paſt recouerie, and
deade through mine iniquitie, thou haſt
come downe from heauen vnto me, taking
vpon thee my mortalitie: thou I ſay
being a king and Lord ſoe puiſſant, haſt
deſcended from heauen vnto thy ſlaue,
and ſeruant, rendring thy ſelfe captiue to
reſerue him a liue: yea thou thy ſelfe haſt
died, and by dying haſt ouercome deathe,

to the end thou mighteſt reſtore me to
life, exalting me to my former dignitie, by
debaſing thy ſelfe to ſoe greate pouerty.
When I was vtterly vndonne, being gone
aſtray, and ſolde to ſinne, thou haſt come
into the worlde for my redemption, and
haſt loued me ſoe dearely, as that thou
haſt giuen thine owne blood for a ranſome
for me: thou haſt loued me (o Lord)
more then thy ſelfe, in that thou haſt vouchſafed
to die for me.
                     Thou haſt therfore in this maruailous
manner, and with ſoe deare a price, recalled
me from baniſhement, redeemed me
frō ſeruitude, deliuered me from puniſhment,
named me after thine owne
name, ſigned me with thine owne blood,
to the end I might alwaies carrie about
me a memoriall of thee, neuer ſuffering it
to departe from my harte, who to redeeme
me, didſt not departe from the
croſſe.
                     With the ſame ſacred oyle with which
thou wert annointed, thou haſt annointed
me in baptiſme, to the end that from thy
name (Chriſt) I might be called a Chriſtian.
                     Beholde thou haſt written me in thy
handes, that thou maieſt ſtill be mindfull
of me, yet with this prouiſo, that I be likewiſe
ſtill mindfull of thee. Thus therefore,

and after an vnſpeakeable manner
hath thy grace and mercy alwaies preuented
me.
                     Thou haſt likewiſe (o my deliuerer)
deliuered me many times from many and
maruelous mighty dangers. When I haue
gone out of the way, thou haſt directed
me; when I haue been ignorant, thou haſt
inſtructed me; when I haue ſinned, thou
haſt corrected me; when I haue been ſorrowfull,
thou haſt gladded me; when I
haue been in deſpaire, thou haſt cōforted
me; when I haue fallen, thou haſt rayſed
me; when I haue ſtoode, thou haſt vpheld
me; when I haue trauailed, thou haſt conducted
me; when I haue arriued, thou haſt
entertained me; when I haue ſlept, thou
haſt guarded me; when I haue called, thou
haſt hearde me.
                  
                  
                     How God doth continuallie looke into
the actions and intentions
of men.
CHAPT. XIV.
                     THeſe, and many other benefits thou
haſt beſtowed vpon me. (o God the
life of my ſoule) of which to ſpeake,
thinke & thanke thee, it ought at all times
to be a thinge ſweete and pleaſing vnto

me, to the end that with all my harte and
with all my ſoule, and with all my minde,
and with all my ſtrength, and with all the
powers of my ſoule and bodie, I might alwaie
                           •
                         raiſe and loue thee, for all the benefit
                           •
                        
which I haue receiued from thee (o
Lord my God) who art the bleſſed ſweetnes
of thoſe that delight in thee.
                     How be it thy eies doe ſee the manyfolde
imperfections that are in me. Thy
eies, I ſay, are more ſhining thē the ſunne,
ſeeing on euerie ſide all the wayes of men
(yea penetratinge the bottome of the
bottomeleſſe depthe) ſoe that in all places,
and perpetuallie, they doe beholde thoſe
that liue well, & thoſe that liue wickedly.
For fithence thou doſt gouerne all thinges,
filling eache one of them, being at all
times, and in all places wholie preſent,
taking care likewiſe of all thinges, which
thou haſt created; (becauſe thou doſt hate
none of thoſe thinges which thou haſt
framed) thou doſt conſider all my footeſtepps
and paths ſoe narrowelie, watching
night and day ouer my cuſtodie, marking
all my waies ſoe diligently, and looking
vppon me perpetuallie, euen as if thou
were forgetfull of all other creatures contained
in heauen or earth, and hadſt care
of noe other ſauing of me onely.
                     Thy eie▪ ſight likewiſe is neither augmented

by looking vppon one thinge
onely (it being immutable) neither is it
diminiſhed by beholding diuerſe thinges
and innumerable. Becauſe thou doſt ſee
many thinges at once (albeit differ
                           •••
                         one
from an other) as plainely and pe
                           ••
                        ectly,
as if thou didſt looke but vppon one onelie.
Thou therfore doſt beholde all thinges
at once, after the ſame manner, as if
thou didſt beholde but one onely, and all
thinges ſeuerallie, as if they were but
one onely; that is, without diuiſion, variation,
or diminiſhing.
                     Whence it followeth, that thou being
alwaies one at all times, doſt without time
beholde me wholy at once, and continuallie,
euen as if thou hadſt no other
thing to thinke vppon, guarding and protecting
me in that manner, as if thou were
mindfull of me onely, and forgetfull of al
others. Becauſe thou art alwaies preſent,
and ready to come vnto me, as often as I
am ready to entertaine thee.
                     Whither ſoeuer I goe, thou (o Lord)
doſt not forſake me, vnleſſe I firſt forſake
thee, and wherſoeuer I am, thou art there
with me, becauſe thou art euery where, to
the end that whither ſoeuer I goe, I might
finde thee, by whom I am preſerued in
my being, leaſt I ſhould periſhe without
thee, for that without 
                           •
                        hee, I ſhould preſently

returne to nothing.
                     Veri
                           •
                        ie I confeſſe, that what thinge or
thinges ſoeuer I vndertake to doe, I am to
doe it in thy ſight; and that which I vndertake
to doe whatſoeuer it be, thou doſt
beholde more plainelie, then I which am
to doe it: becauſe thou art preſent with
me at the doing of euerie thinge, continuallie
marking all my thoughtes, intentions,
delightes, and actions.
                     The deſires and imaginations of my
minde, whatſoeuer they be, are at al times
knowen and apparant vnto thee. Thou
(o Lord) knoweſt from whence the ſpirit
or ſoule of man proceedeth, where it abideth,
and whither it goeth, for that thou
art he that doth ſearche into the ſoules of
all men, who knoweſt beſt, (being the internall
iudge) whether the roote, that
bringeth for the faire leaues, be ſweete or
or ſower, looking likewiſe narrowlie into
the verie pithe or harte of the roote: neither
doſt thou looke into the intention
onely, but goeſt further, and by the infallible
truth of thy light doſt gather, nomber,
ſee, and ſeeke out the innermoſt pithe
of the roote thereof, to the end thou
maieſt render to euerie man, not onely
according to his workes, and intention,
but alſoe according to the internall harte
of the roote, which is hidden, from whēce

the intention of him that worketh hath
his beginninge.
                     Thou (o Lord) doſt beholde, thy eares
doe heare, and thy eies doe ſee and conſider
what mine intention is, when I vndertake
any thinge whatſoeuer I haue in my
imagination, and in whatſoeuer I doe take
delectation, thou (I ſay) doſt marke, conſider,
note, & write the ſame in thy booke,
be it good or euill, that at the day of iudgement
(when theſe thy bookes ſhalbe
opened, and men are to be iudged according
to the thinges in them con
                           •
                        ained)
that which is good may by thee be rewarded,
and that which is euill puniſhed.
                     This is that, peraduenture, whereof
thou haſt forewarned vs ſaying: I will
cōſider the thinges, that laſtly wil happen
vnto them. And that likewiſe (o Lord)
which is written of thee. He conſidereth
the end of euerie man: for that in all our
doinges, thou doſt more narrowely marke
the end and ſcope of the intention, for
which they are donne, then the meere act
of him that doth them.
                     Now when I ponder this diligently in
my minde (o Lord my God who art terrible
to beholde, and of inuincible fortitude)
I cannot but be maruailouſlie affraied
and aſhamed, conſidering the great
neceſſitie we haue to liue iuſtly and vp,

rightly, we being to doe all our actions in
the ſight of him that is to be our iudge,
who ſeeth all thinges apparentlie.
                  
                  
                     That man without the aſistance of
Gods grace, is able to doe
nothing of himſelfe.
CHAPT. XV.
                     O God moſt powerful and potent ouer
the ſpiritts or ſoules of all fleſh,
whoſe eies behold all the waies of the
children of Adam, from the day of their
birthe, vntill the day of their death, to the
end, thou maieſt render to euery man, according
to his actions, be they good or
euill, teache me (I beſeeche thee) how
to confeſſe vnto thee my pouertie; becauſe
I haue heretofore vaunted that I was riche
and needed nothing, not knowing that I
was poore, blinde, naked, wretched, and
in miſerie, for that I thought my ſelfe to
be ſomething, when I was nothinge. I
ſaied with my ſelfe, I ſhall become a wiſe
man, and I became a foole. I thought my
ſelfe to be prudent and diſcreete, and I
was deceiued, for that I nowe perceiue
that it is a guift gratis by thee giuen, without
whom we can doe nothing, becauſe,
vnleſſe thou (o Lord) guarde the cittye,

he watcheth but in vaine, that guardeth
the ſame.
                     Thus (o Lord) by leauing, me and prouing
me, thou haſt taught me to know
my ſelfe, not in reſpect of thee, that thou
mightſt know me, but in reſpect of me,
that I might knowe my ſelfe, becauſe (as
I haue already ſaied) I thought my ſelfe to
be ſomething of my ſelfe; neither did I
perceiue that it was thou that didſt gouerne
me, vntill thou didſt for a while forſake
me: whereupon I forthwith fell, by
which I did ſee and knowe, that it was
thou that didſt gouerne me, and that my
fall hapned throughe mine owne faulte,
and my ariſing againe to grace, by the
meanes onely of thy grace.
                     Thou haſt opened mine eies (o diuine
light) thou haſt awakened and enlightned
me, ſoe that now I ſee that mans life is a
temptation vppon earth; neither hath
fraile fleſh, or any mortall man liuing, iuſt
occaſion to glorie of himſelfe before thee,
or to preſume of his iuſtification, ſithence
all the good we haue, be it little or greate,
proceedeth wholy and freely from thee,
neither can we attribute any thing iuſtly
to our ſelues, ſauing onely our iniquitie.
                     Whereof then ſhall any mortall man
glorie? ſhall he glorie of his iniquitie? This
is not glorie, but meere miſerie. Shall he

therfore glorie of his goodnes? ſhal he
glorie of that which is an others? becauſe
all goodnes and glorie is thine (o Lord)
and belongeth to thee. He therfore, that
vſurpeth that glorie to himſelfe that is due
to thee, is a theefe and a robber, and like
vnto the diuell, who deſired to bereaue
thee of thy glorie. For he that deſireth to
be prayſed in reſpect of the guift which
thou haſt giuen him, and doth not ſeeke
thy glorie therein, but his owne; albeit in
reſpect of thy guift he be praiſed of men,
yet by thee he is thought worthy of blame,
for that with that guift which thou
haſt giuen him, he hath not ſought thy
glory, but his owne. But he that is praiſed
of men, being by thee thought worthy of
blame, will not be defended by men,
when thou ſhalt judge him, nor freede by
them, when thou ſhalt condemne him.
                     Thou therfore (o Lord) who didſt
forme me in my mothers wombe, permit
me not to fall into that reproachfull infamy,
as to be vpbraieded as one that
woulde bereaue thee of thy glorie. To
thee is due all glorie, who art the author
of all goodnes, but to vs, ſhame and miſery,
who according to our deſerts, are
worthy of all wretchednes, were it not
that thou doſt take pitty vpon vs.
                     Thou (o Lord) art pittifull indeede, full

of compaſſion towardes all men, and hating
nothing of thoſe thinges, which
thou haſt made, beſtowing vpon vs many
benefits▪ and enriching vs with thy greateſt
guifts: becauſe thou doſt fauour thoſe
that are friendleſſe, making thē to aboūde
with the riches of thy goodnes.
                     Beholde now (o Lord) we are thy
poore diſtreſſed children, we are thy little
flock, open thy gates vnto vs, to the end,
that thoſe that are poore may feede and
be filled aboundantly, and thoſe that ſe
                           •
                        ke
thee, may praiſe thee eternallie.
                     I knowe (o Lord) and confeſſe (becauſe
thou haſt inſtructed me) that they
onely that acknowledge themſelues to be
poore and needy, and confeſſe vnto thee
their pouerty, ſhalbe enriched by thee, in
ſoe much, that they that imagine themſelues
riche (being indeede poore and needie)
are not to expect any ſpirituall guift,
or grace from thee.
                     Wherfore (o Lord my God) I doe acknowledge
and confeſſe vnto thee my
pouertie, rendring vnto thee all glorie (all
being thine and due vnto thee) becauſe all
the good that is donne by me, proceedeth
wholy from thee.
                     I confeſſe (o Lord) (like as thou haſt
taught me) that I am nothing els, but
meere vanitie, the ſhadowe of deathe, a

darke bottomeleſſe dungeon, a voide and
vnprofitable plot of grounde, bringing
forth nothinge without thy bleſſing, the
naturall fruit thereof being confuſion,
ſinne, and eternall death and damnation.
All the good that euer, I had heretofore,
I had it from thee, al the good I haue likewiſe
at this preſent, is wholy thine, and
proceedeth from the handes of thy liberalitie.
                     When I haue ſtoode vpright, it hath
been by thy aſſiſtance: when I haue fallen,
it hath been through mine owne negligence:
when I was fallē likewiſe, I ſhoulde
for euer haue remained in the mire, if
thou hadſt not raiſed me: and being blind,
I ſhoulde for euer, haue beene blind, if
thou hadſt not enlightned me. When I
was fallen I ſhould neuer haue riſen, if
thou hadſt not with thy hand rayſed me;
yea after thou haſt rayſed me, I ſhoulde
haue fallen againe immediately, if thou
hadſt not vphelde me. I ſhoulde likewiſe
haue periſhed many times, and been vtterly
vndonne, if thou hadſt not gouerned
me.
                     Thus (o Lord) and in this manner hath
thy grace and mercy preuented me from
time to time and continually, deliuering
me from all miſhapps, that might haue
befallen me; preſeruing me from perills.

that are paſt, deliuering me out of thoſe
that are preſent, and ſtrengthning me
againſt thoſe that are to come: cutting in
in ſunder before me the ſnares of ſinne,
remouing likewiſe all cauſes and occaſiōs
of the ſame; for if thou hadſt not afforded
me this fauoure, I ſhoulde haue committed
all ſortes of ſinnes whatſoeuer. Becauſe
I knowe (o Lord) that there is noe
ſinne committed by one man, which an
other coulde not likewiſe doe the ſame,
if mans Creator, by whom he was made;
did not aſſiſt him.
                     Thou therfore haſt cauſed and commaunded
me to abſtaine from iniquity,
giuing me thy grace, that I might belieue
in thee. For thou (o Lord) didſt direct me
to doe that which was to thy glory, and
mine owne ſaluation, giuing me grace and
vnderſtanding, that I might auoide adulterie,
or all other ſinne.

CHAPT. XVI.
                     THe tempter was abſent, and thou
haſt been the cauſe that he was abſent,
time and place haue been wanting,
and this hath happned through thy fatherly

diſpoſition. The tempter was preſent,
hauing opportunitie of place and
time, but thou haſt kept me from conſenting
vnto him. The tempter came to tēpte
me, in his owne deformed and ougly
forme, and thou haſt giuen me corage to
contemne him. The tempter came as an
armed ſouldier with greate puiſſance and
power, and thou haſt fortified me, and enfeebled
him, to the end, he might not vanquiſhe
me. The tempter came, being
transformed into an Angell of light, and
to the end he might not deceiue me, thou
haſt rebuked him, and giuen me light that
I might knowe him.
                     This is that feirce and fiery Dragon,
the old ſerpent, which is commonly called
the Diuell and Satan, hauing ſeuen
heades and ten hornes, whom thou haſt
created to be deluded in the wide and
ſpatious ſea of this tempeſtuous worlde,
in which there are infinite multitudes of
creatures that creepe, and of beaſtes both
ſmall and greate (that is diuerſe ſortes of
diuells) who day and night doe nothing
els but range about ſeeking whom they
many deuoure, if thou deliuer vs not from
theire power.
                     This is that old Dragon, who in Paradiſe
had his beginning, who with his
taile caſteth downe to the grounde, the

thirde parte of the ſtarrs of heauen, who
poiſonneth the waters of the world with
his venime, that men may die by drinking
of them, who trampleth vpon golde, as if
it were durte, or mire, hauing a confidence
that the riuer Iordan (that is righteous,
and religious men) will flowe likewiſe
into his mouthe: being of that wonderfull
ſtrength and power, as that he
feareth noe man whatſoeuer. And who
then ſhall defende vs from his biting and
ſtinging? Who but (thee o Lord can kepe
vs from being deuoured by him, who haſt
broken the heades of the greate Dragon?
                     Stretche forthe (o Lord we beſeeche
thee) the winges of thy mercy ouer vs,
that we may flie vnder them from the
face of this Dragon, that doth perſecute
vs, and ſaue vs from his hornes with the
ſhielde of thy defence. Becauſe the onely
thing that he doth, and hath alwaies deſired,
is to deuoure the ſoules, which thou
haſt created.
                     Wherfore (o Lord our God) we cry to
thee, beſeeching thee to deliuer vs from
our dayly aduerſarie, who whether we
ſleepe or wake, eate or drinke, or whatſoeuer
we doe els, ceaſeth not by all meanes,
day and night, by his deceiptes and
cunning deuiſes, ſometimes openly, ſomtimes
ſecretlye, to ſhoote his poiſoned

arrowes at vs, that he may kill and murther▪
our ſoules. And yet (o Lord) behold
our madnes, for that albeit we ſee this
Dragon comminge againſt vs with open
mouthe, readie to deuoure vs, yett we
ſleepe, and play the wantons laſciuiouſlie
in our laſines, as if we were ſecure in his
preſence, that deſireth nothing els, but to
deſtroy vs. Our ennimie alwaies watcheth
without ſleepe, that he may ſlay our ſoules,
and we will not awake from ſleepe,
that we may ſaue our ſelues.
                     Beholde, he hath laied infinite ſnares
before our feete, and hath filled all our
waies with many pitfalls and ginnes,
therby to entrapppe our ſoules, and who
ſhalbe able to eſcape them? He hath laied
ſnares in riches, he hath laied ſnares in
pouertie, he hath laied ſnares in meate, in
drinke, in recreation, in ſleepe, and in
watching: he hath laied ſnares in our wordes,
and in our workes, & in all our waies.
                     Wherfore we beſeeche thee (o Lord)
to deliuer vs, frō the ſnares of theſe Huntsmen,
and from ſharpe and bitter wordes;
that we may confeſſe vnto thee ſaying:
Bleſſed be our Lord, who hath not giuen
vs as a prey vnto theire teethe. Our ſoule

                           ••
                        ſcaped, euen as a ſparrowe out of the
ſnare of the fouler. The ſnare is broken,
and we are deliuered.
                  
                  
                     
                     That God is the light of the iuſt.
CHAPT. XVII.
                     ENlighten mine eies (o my Lord and
my light) that I may ſee light, and
walke in thy light, and eſcape from falling
into his ſnares. For who is able to eſcape
thoſe his manifolde ſnares, vnleſſe he ſee
them? And who is able to ſee them, if
thou with thy light doe not enlighten
him? Becauſe he (being the father of darkenes)
doth hide his ſnares in darknes,
that all thoſe may be taken in them that
are in darknes, to witt, the children of
darknes, who are depriued of thy light, in
which whoſoeuer walketh ſhall not feare.
Becauſe whoſoeuer walketh in the day
time, ſtumbleth not, but he that walketh
in the night ſeaſon, falleth, and hurteth
himſelfe, becauſe the light is not in him.
                     Thou (o Lord) art the light, thou art
the light of the children of light, thou art
the day, that knoweth noe ſunn-ſetting,
in which thy children doe walke without
ſt
                           ••
                        bling, and without which all they
that walke, are in darknes, for that they
want thee, the light of the worlde, to direct
them.
                     Beholde we dayly ſee, that the farther

of any one is from thee the true light, the
more he is ouerwhelmed with the darknes
of ſinne, & the more he is in darknes,
the leſſe he ſeeth the ſnares, that are ſett
in his way, and conſequentlie knoweth
them the leſſe, by which meanes he is
drawen, and falleth more frequentlie into
them, and yet knoweth not that he is fallen,
which is a thing, that aboue others
ſhoulde cauſe vs to deteſt ſinne. For he
that knoweth not that he is fallen, is by
ſoe much the leſſe carefull to ariſe, by how
much the more he thinketh himſelfe to
ſtande.
                     Now therfore (o Lord my God) who
art the light of my minde, enlighten mine
eies, that I may ſee, and knowe, to the end
I may not fall in the ſight of mine aduerſaries.
For our aduerſarie the Diuell laboureth
vtterly to deſtroy vs, whom we
deſire, thou wilt cauſe to be conſumed before
our face, euer as waxe is conſumed
before the face of the fire.
                     Becauſe he (o Lord) is the firſt and laſt
robber, who conſpired to bereaue thee of
thy glory: who being ſwollen and puffed
vp with pride, burſt and fell on his face,
whom thou haſt throwne downe headlong
from thy holy hill, and from amidſt
thoſe fiery ſtones, amongſt which he
walked.
                     
                        
And now (o Lord my God, and my life)
ſince the time he hath fallen, he ceaſeth
not to perſecute thy childrē. And through
the hatred he hath againſt thee (o king of
infinite puiſſance) he deſireth to deſtroy
this creature of thine, whom thy omnipotent
goodnes hath created according to
thine owne image, to poſſeſſe that glory,
which he hath loſt by his pride and inſolencie.
                     But thou o Lord (that art our force
and fortreſſe,) bruiſe & cruſhe him in peeces,
that he may not deuoure vs thy lambes:
and enlighten vs with thy grace, that
we may ſee the ſnares which he hath
laied to entrappe vs, and may eſcape to
thee, o joi of iſrael.
                     All theſe thinges thou knoweſt (o Lord)
better then we, who knoweſt his enmitie
and deſpite againſt vs, and his obdurate
obſtinacie. Neither doe I ſay this, as one
that woulde informe thee (for that thou
ſeeſt all thinges, ſoe that our leaſt thoughtes
are not hidden from thee) but before
the feete of thy maieſtie (o eternall Iudge)
I complaine againſt mine aduerſarie, to
the end, thou maieſt damne him, and ſaue
vs thy children, whoſe force doth depēde
of thee.
                     Verily this mine aduerſarie (o Lord)
is wily, turning and winding diuers waies,

ſoe that the wilines of his waies, and the
forme of his countenance, is very hardly
knowne, vnles thou illuminate our vnderſtanding.
For ſometimes he is heere,
ſometimes there, ſometimes he transformeth
himſelfe into a wolfe, ſometimes
into darknes, ſometimes into light, vſing
diuerſitie of temptations, according to
qualities, places, and times, and according
to the variation of thinges.
                     For to deceiue thoſe that are ſad, he ſeemeth
to be ſad, to mocke thoſe that are
merrie: to delude ſpirituall men, he changeth
himſelfe into an Angell of light; to
ſubdue thoſe that be feirce, he becommeth
milde like a lambe; and to deuoure
thoſe that are milde, he becommeth feirce
like a wolfe.
                     All theſe temptations he putteth in
practice, according to the like-lihoode he
hath, that they will take effect, to the end
he may terrifie ſome with feare by night,
others with the arrowe that flyeth by day,
others with ghoſts and gaſtly vſions walking
in darknes, others through feare of
inuaſions, others with diabolicall temptations,
that happen at noone day.
                     Who then is able to knowe theſe thinges,
and to finde out his fallacies? Who is
able to deſcribe the forme of his attire,
& the hideous order of his teethe? Beholde

he hadeth his arrowes in the quiuer, and
couereth his ſnares vnder the forme of
light, in ſoe much that it is a thing almoſt
impoſſible to perceiue them, vnleſſe we
receiue light from thee o Lord (who art
our hope) by which we may ſee all thinges.
                     Neither doth he hide his ſubtile ſnares
in the workes of the fleſhe onely, which
are eaſiely perceiued, nor in vices onely,
but alſoe in Religious actes themſelues,
making vices to ſeeme vertues, and changing
himſelfe into an Angell of light.
                     Theſe and many other abhominable
enterpriſes doth this ſonne of Belial (Satā
the diuell) endeuoure to practice againſt
vs, lying in waite ſometimes like a Lion,
ſometimes like a Dragon, openly and ſecretely,
within and without, by day and
by night, to bereaue vs of our ſoules. But
thou (o Lord) who ſaueſt thoſe that truſte
in thee, deliuer vs from him (we beſeeche
thee) that he may greiue to ſee vs deliuered,
and thou (for the ſame) maieſt by vs
be prayſed, o Lord our God.
                  
                  
                     
                     A further acknowledging of the
benefits of God.
CHAPT. XVIII.
                     I Therfore the ſon of thy handemaide,
hauing alreaddy committed, and commended
my ſelfe into the hands of thy
mercie, will now with my whole harte
confeſſe vnto thee (o Lord my deliuerer)
and call to minde all the benefits, which
thou haſt beſtowed vpon me, during my
whole life, euen from mine infancie. Becauſe
I knowe that ingratitude doth very
much diſpleaſe thee, being the roote of
all ſpirituall euill, and a winde that doth
blaſte and burne vp whatſoeuer is good,
hindering the fountaine of thy diuine
goodnes from flowing into vs: by meanes
whereof our euill actions that were forgiuen
and forgotten, are againe remembred,
and our good workes become deade,
and are noe more obtained.
                     Wherefore o Lord my deliuerer, I will
giue thee thankes, leaſt I be founde to be
vngratefull vnto thee, for that thou haſt
deliuered me. As often as that infernall
Dragon hath ſwallowed me downe, thou
(o Lord) haſt drawen me violently out of
his mouth. As often as I haue ſinned, and

he was ready to deuoure me, thou (o Lord
my God) haſt preſerued me. When I offended
thee by breaking thy commaundements,
he ſtoode readie to hale me away
to hell, if thou hadſt not hindered
him. I did offend thee, and thou didſt defende
me. I did not reſpect thee, yet thou
didſt protect me. I departed from thee,
ſeeking to ioyne my ſelfe to mine aduerſarie,
and thou didſt affright him, to the
end he ſhoulde not entertaine me.
                     Theſe benefits (o Lord my God) thou
didſt beſtowe vpon me, and I knew it not.
Truly thou haſt diuers times dealt in this
mercifull manner with me, deliueringe
me out of the iawes of the Diuell, ſnatching
me out of the mouthe of the Lion,
yea thou haſt often times ſaued me, from
fallinge into the pitt of eternall damnation,
I little thinking whither I was going.
Verily I haue deſcended to the very gates,
and thou haſt kept me from entring in. I
drewe nigh to the dores of death, and by
meanes of thee, they haue not beene ſhutt
vpon me.
                     Thou haſt deliuered me many times (o
my Sauiour) from corporall deathe after
the like manner. When greuious ſickneſſes
did afflict me, when diuers dangers
did affright me, thou (o Lord) didſt ſtill
aſſiſt, and mercifullie ſaue me, deliuering

me both by ſea and lande, from fire and
ſworde, and from all aduerſitie.
                     Thou 
                           •
                        ruly (o Lord) didſt knowe full
well, that if then I had chanced to dye,
my ſoule had gone to hell, and I ſhoulde
haue beene damned euerlaſtinglie. But thy
mercy and grace (o Lord my God) hath
preuented me, ſauing me from the death
both of ſoule and body. Theſe and many
other benefits thou haſt beſtowed vpon
me, and I was blinde & did not perceiue
it, vntill thou didſt enlighten me.
                     Now therefore (o Lord my God) the
light of my ſoule, my life by which I liue,
the light of mine eies, by which I ſee: beholde
thou haſt enlightned me, and I doe
knowe thee; becauſe I doe liue by thee,
for which I doe hartely thanke thee, offering
thee prayſes according to my poore abilitie,
although they are ſmall & of little
value, and nothing anſwerable to the manifold
benefitts which I haue receiued frō
thee. Becauſe thou art my onely God, my
kinde creator, who loueſt our ſoules, and
hateſt nothing that thou haſt made.
                     Beholde I (o Lord the cheife of al thoſe
ſinners, that thou haſt ſaued, will confeſſe
and acknowledge the manifolde benefits
which I haue receiued from thee,
to the ēd I may ſtirre vp others to doe the
like, and be a witnes of thy wonderfull

mercy: becauſe thou haſt deliuered me
from the loweſt hell, not once, or twice,
or thrice onely, but an hūdred, yea a thouſande
times. I alwaies went on towardes
hell, and thou didſt bring me back againe
continuallie, ſoe that, if thou wouldeſt,
thou mighteſt a thouſand times haue
iuſtly damned me. Yet thou wouldeſt,
not, becauſe thou doſt loue our ſoules,
and in hope that we will amend and doe
pennance, thou doſt as it were winke at
our wickednes, o Lord our God of much
mercy in all thy wayes.
                     Now therfore (o Lord my God) I doe
ſee and perceiue theſe thinges, by meanes
of the light, which thou haſt giuen me,
and my ſoule doth as it were faint by
thinking of thy maruailous greate mercy
towardes me; for that thou haſt deliuered
my ſoule from the deepeſt hell, and haſt
reſtored me to life. I was wholie deade, &
thou haſt wholie rayſed me.
                     Wherfore ſithence that my whole life
doth depende wholy of thee, I doe wholy
offer my whole ſelfe vnto thee. Let my
whole ſpirit, my whole harte, my whole
body, yea my whole life liue to thee my
ſweete life; becauſe thou haſt wholy deliuered
me, that thou mightſt wholy poſſeſſe
me, thou haſt wholy ſaued me, that
thou mightſt wholy haue me.
                     
                        
                        
                           •
                        et me therfore loue thee o Lord, my
ſtrength, let me loue thee, my vnſpeakeable
ioy and ſolace: and let my whole life
(which was deade through my miſerie
and is raiſed againe through thy mercy)
be eſteemed from hence for the not mine,
but thine, who art a milde, and mercifull
God, and of much mercy, towardes all
thoſe that loue thy holy name.
                     Wherfore (o Lord my God) who doſt
ſanctifie me, thou in thy lawe haſt commaunded,
that I ſhoulde loue thee with
all my harte, with all my ſoule, with
all my minde, with all the ſtrength and
forces of my body, and with all the internall
affections of my minde, ech hower &
moment, in which I enioy the benefit of
thy mercy: becauſe I ſhoulde continuallie
periſhe, if thou didſt not continuallie gouerne
me; I ſhoulde continuallie dye, if
thou didſt not continuallie receiue me, ſoe
that euery moment thou doſt oblige me
vnto thee, by beſtowing euery moment
many benefits vpon me.
                     As therfore there is noe hower or minute,
in which I doe not receiue ſome benefitt
or other from thee: ſoe there ought
to be not moment, in which I haue not
thee before mine eies, and in my memorie;
and in which I doe not with all my
ſtrength loue thee.
                     
                        
But this is a thing that ſurpaſſeth my
abilitie, vnleſſe thou of thy liberalitie beſtowe
it vpon me. From whom euerye
good and perfect guift hath his beginning,
deſcending from the Father of lightes:
with whom there is noe mutation,
or ſhadowe of alteration.
                     Verily this prerogatiue of louing thee,
proceedeth not from the deſire or endeuoure
of any mortall man, but is giuen
to him, on whom it pleaſeth thee to take
compaſſion. This guift is thine (o Lord)
who art the giuer of all good. Thou commaundeſt
that we ſhoulde loue thee,
graunt vs grace to doe that which thou
doſt commaunde, and commaunde whatſoeuer
it ſhall pleaſe thee.
                  
                  
                     Of the vehemencie of loue or
charitie.
CHAPT. XIX.
                     O My God I doe loue thee, deſiring▪
to loue thee more and more continuallie,
becauſe thou art indeede more
ſweete then any honie, more nouriſhing
then any milke, more bright then any
light. Wherefore thou art to me more
deare, then golde, or ſiluer, or any pretious
ſtone whatſoeuer. For whatſoeuer I did

whilſt I liued in the worlde, did but diſpleaſe
me, inreſpect of thy ſweetnes, and
the beauty of thy beloued houſe.
                     O fire, that doſt alwaies burne, and art
neuer extinguiſhed; O loue that art alwaies
hoate, and neuer groweſt colde,
inflame me with the fire of thy loue. Let
me I ſay be ſett on fire by thee, to the end,
I may wholy loue thee. For he that loueth
any thing beſides thee, or which he loueth
not for thee, loueth thee by that meanes
with leſſe vehemencie.
                     I wil loue thee (o Lord) becauſe thou haſt
loued me firſt. But how ſhall I be able to
expreſſe the tokens of thy ſurpaſſing great
loue towardes me, by reaſon of thy innumerable
benefits, with which thou haſt
nouriſhed me from my very infancy?
                     For in the benefit of creation, when in
the beginning thou didſt create me of nothing,
by making me according to thine
owne image, thou haſt honoured and exalted
me aboue other creatures which
thou haſt made, ennobling me with the
light of thy counte
                           •
                        ance, with which
thou haſt ſigned and ſealed the entrance
of my hart; by which likewiſe thou haſt
made me different from ſenſleſſe creatures
and bruite beaſtes, and in dignity almoſt
equall to the Angells.
                     All this ſeemed little to thy diui
                           ••
                        e

Maieſtie, for that thou haſt not ceaſed to
cheariſhe me dayly euer ſince, with many
ſingular and ſurpaſſing greate preſents of
thy magnificence, yea thou haſt fedd and
foſtered me, as if I were thy little childe
and onely darling, giuing me ſucke from
the breaſtes of thy diuine conſolation.
                     Verily thou haſt cauſed all creatures to
ſerue and obey me, to the end, I might
wholy employ my ſelfe in the ſeruice of
thee.
                  
                  
                     Howe God hath made all thinges ſubiect
to the ſeruice of man.
CHAPT. XX
                     THou (o Lord) haſt made all thinges
ſubiect to man, that man ſhoulde
be wholie ſubiect to thee alone. And to
the end thou migheſt oblige man to be
wholy thine, thou haſt made him ruler
ouer euery thing.
                     All exteriour thinges thou haſt created
for the body; the body for the ſoule, and
the ſoule for thee: to the end that the ſoule
might haue nothing els to doe, but to
loue and delight in thee, hauinge thee as
her ſolace, and inferiour thinges at her
ſeruice
                     For whatſoeuer is contained within the
compaſſe of heauen, is inferiour to the

ſoule of man, which was created, to enioy
the moſt ſoueraigne and ſupreame
good, by whoſe poſſeſſion it might become
bleſſed. To whom, if it ſhall adhere,
by forſakiuge the familiarity and freindſhipp
of all thinges heere beneath (being
all ſubiect to mutabilitie) it ſhall without
doubte heereafter beholde moſt cearely
the face of that ſupreame Maieſtie and
eternall immortalitie, whoſe ſight it now
deſireth ſoe earn ſtly. It ſhall then I ſay)
enioy thoſe moſt excellent guiftes & graces
in heauen, in compariſon of whome
whatſoeuer is heere ſeene, is to be eſteemed
as nothing.
                     Thoſe are the thinges, which neither

                           •
                        ie hath ſeene, not eare hath hearde, neither
haue they euer entred into the harte
of man, which God hath prepared for
thoſe that loue him. Theſe thou wilt beſtowe
(o Lord) vpon the ſoule of man.
Yea euen in this life, thou doſt daily make
glad the ſoules of thy ſeruants, being the
louer of ſoules.
                     But why doe I wonder at this (o Lord
my God) ſeing by doing this, thou doſt
honoure thine owne image and ſimilitude,
accordinge to which our ſoules are
created? For which our body likewiſe, although
it be ſubiect to corruption, and of
noe reputation, yet that it might ſee, thou

haſt giuen it the light of the firmament,
by meanes of thy ſeruants, the ſonne and
moone, who without being euer weary
doe continuallie day and night by vertue
of thy commaundment, ſerue and obey
thy children.
                     Moreouer, thou haſt beſtowed vpon
the body, the purity of the ayr
                           •
                        , that it
might breathe; varietie of ſoundes, that it
might heare; ſondry ſweete ſauoures, that
it might ſmell diuerſitie of meates, that it
might taſte; groſſe and corpulent bodies,
that it might feele.
                     Thou haſt ordained labouring beaſtes,
in his neceſſities to ſerue and aide him,
the foules, of the aire, the fiſhes of the
ſea, and the fruites of the earth, to feede
and refreſhe him. Thou haſt cauſed the
earth to bring for the medicines for 
                           •
                        ache
ſeuerall maladie. Finallie thou haſt prepared
ſeuerall ſalues for ſeuerall ſores, varietie
of remedies for diuerſitie of infirmities:
becauſe thou art mercifull and milde,
and being the potter by whom we were
framed, thou knoweſt the brickle ſtuffe
whereof we are formed, becauſe we all
are as a peece of potters clay in thy hande.
                  
                  
                     
                     How by the conſideration of benefits
temporall, we may gather the
greatnes of thoſe that
are celeſtiall.
CHAPT. XXI.
                     GIue me grace (o Lord to ſee the
greatnes of thy mercy, giue me yet
greater light and vnderſtanding I beſeech
thee, that I may perceiue it more plainely.
For by the leſſer benefits (o holy Lord
God, our good Creator) we growe to vnderſtande
thy greater; and by thoſe which
we viſibly ſee heer, we come to the knowledg
of thoſe that are inuiſible in heauen.
                     For if thou (o God doſt beſtowe vpon
our baſe and corruptible body, ſoe greate
and innumerable benefits, from the firmament
and ayre, from the earthe & ſea,
from the light and darknes, from heate
and ſhadowe, from dewe and raine, from
windes and ſhewers, from foules & fiſhes,
from beaſtes and trees, from variety of
hearbes and plantes, and of al other of thy
earthely creatures, ſeruing vs ſucceſſiuely
in their turnes, that by them tho
                           •
                        
maieſt ſolace the ſorowes of this our weariſome life;
what manner of benefits are

thoſe (I pray thee) how greate (I ſay) and
innumerable ſhall thoſe comfortes and
commodities be, which thou haſt prepared
for thoſe that loue thee in that heauenly
country, where apparantly face to
face we ſhall ſee and beholde thee? If thou
doſt ſoe much for vs now in this earthly
priſon, what wilt thou doe for vs heerafter
in the palace, of thy heauenly habitation?
                     Greate certainely and innumerable are
theſe thy workes (o Lord and kinge of
heauen.) For ſeing all theſe thinges are
exceeding good and delightfull, which
thou haſt imparted to good and bad men
in common, what manner of thinges
wil thoſe be, which thou haſt reſerued for
the good alone? If the guifts, which thou
doſt now giue vnto thy freindes and foes
together, be ſoe innumerable and many:
how greate & innumerable, how ſweete
and delightfull will thoſe be, which thou
wilt beſtowe heereafter vpon thy freinds
onely? If thou doſt giue vs ſoe greate comfortes
on this ſorrowfull day of weepings
how greate wilt thou giue vs on the feſtiuall
day of the wedding? If ſoe greate delightes
are contained in this earthly priſon,
how greate are contayned in the
countrie of heauen?
                     There was neuer yet any eye (o God)

without thee, that hath ſeene the pleaſures,
which thou haſt prepared for thoſe
that loue thee. Becauſe the immenſitie of
thy ſweetnes (which thou haſt reſeru
                           ••
                        
for thoſe that feare thee) is anſwerable
vnto the immenſitie of thy magnificence.
                     Wherfore (o Lord my God) like as
thou art greate and immenſe, there being
neither end of thy greatnes, or number
of thy wiſedome, or meaſure of thy bounteouſnes:
ſoe likewiſe, there is neither
end or number, nor meaſure of thy recompence,
but like as thou art greate, ſoe
is likewiſe thy rewarde and recompence:
becauſe thou thy ſelfe art their rewarde
and recompence, that fight for thee according
to thy holy ordinance.
                  
                  
                     That the ſweetnes of God, doth take
away the preſent bitternes of
the Worlde.
CHAPT. XXII.
                     TH
                           •
                        ſe (o Lord God, the ſanctifier of
thy Saincts) are thoſe greate benefits
of thine, with which thou haſt aboundantly
ſupplied and repleniſhed the
wantes of thy children: becauſe thou are
the hope of thoſe that are in deſperation,
their comforte that are in affliction, thou

art a crowne of confidence adorned with
glory, prepared for thoſe that ouercome.
                     Thou art the eternall foode and fullnes
of thy hungry ſeruants, to be diſtributed
to thoſe that hunger after righteouſnes.
Thou art the euerlaſting comforte, who
beſtoweſt thy ſelfe on them only, that
deſpiſe all worldly comforte, in hope of
that endleſſe comforte, which they ſhall
haue of thee. Becauſe thoſe that are comforted
eere, are vnworthy to be comforted
by thee heereafter. But they are by
thee comforted, who are heere for thee
afflicted; and they that are partakers of
thy paſſions, are likewiſe partakers of thy
conſolations. Certainely noe man can be
comforted in both worldes, or reioyce
heere in this life, and in the next likewiſe:
but of neceſſitie he muſt looſe the one,
that will get the other.
                     When I conſider theſe thinges (o Lord
my comforter) my ſoule refuſeth to be
comforted in this life, to the end it may
be thought worthy of thy eternall comfortes:
becauſe according to reaſon, it ſeemeth
that he is worthy to looſe thee, that
taketh more delight in any other thing,
then in thee.
                     Wherfore (o ſouueraigne truth) by
thine owne ſelfe I beſeeche thee, permitt
me not to take pleaſure in any vanitie. But

let all tranſitorie thinges ſeeme bitter vnto
me, that thou alone maieſt ſeeme ſweete
vnto my ſoule, who art that ineſtimable
ſweetnes, that maketh bitter thinges to
be ſweete.
                     Thy ſweetnes made the ſtones of the
ſtreame, ſeeme ſweete vnto Saint Stephan,
with which he was ſtoned. Thy
ſweetnes made the burning gridiron
ſeeme ſweete vnto Saint Laurence, on
which he was broyled. By meanes of thy
ſweetnes, the Apoſtles went ioyfullie frō
the ſight of the councell, for that they
were thought worthy to ſuffer reproache
for thy name. Saint Andrewe went with
ioy and alacritie towardes the Croſſe, becauſe
he went with haſt towardes thy
ſweetnes. The Princes of the Apoſtles
likewiſe (Saint Peter & Saint Paule) with
this thy ſweetnes were repleniſhed, ſo that
to obtaine it, the one of them made
choice to be crucified, the other without
feare to looſe his heade. Saint Bartholomewe
to buy it, gaue his owne skinne:
and Sainte Iohn to taſte of it, without
feare, drunke vp a cuppe of poiſon.
                     Noe ſooner had Saint Peter taſted of
this ſweetnes, but forthwith forgetting
all inferiour thinges, he cried out
as one inebriated and ouercome with ioy,
ſaying: Lord, it is good for vs to be heere,

let vs make heere three tabernacles, let
vs remaine heere in diuine contemplation,
becauſe we want noe other thing.
It is ſufficiēt for vs (ſaide he, to ſee thee,
it is ſufficient to be ſatisfied with ſoe greate
ſweetnes. He had noe ſooner taſted one
onely droppe of that heauenly ſweetenes;
but he immediatelye forgott all other
ſweetenes. What woulde he haue ſaied
(thinke you) if he had taſted of the immenſe
ſweetenes of thy diuinitie, which
thou haſt kept in ſtore for thoſe that loue
thee?
                     That Virgin likewiſe had taſted of this
thy vnſpeakeable ſweetenes, of whom
we reade, that ſhee went to the priſon,
in that pleaſant and merrie manner, as if
ſhee had been inuited to ſome banquet
or ſupper. He likewiſe (I ſuppoſe) had
taſted of this ſweetnes, who ſaied: How
greate (o Lord) is the multitude of
thy ſweetneſſe, which thou haſt laied
vp in ſtore for thoſe that feare thee!
Who likewiſe did put vs in minde of it
ſaying: Taſte, and ſee, becauſe our Lord
is ſweete.
                     This (o Lord God) is that happines,
which we doe hope thou wilt beſtowe
vpon vs: for which we fight for thee continuallie,
for which we mortifie our ſelues
for the
                           •
                         dailie, to the end we may liue

with thee in that happy life of thine,
which ſhall laſt euerlaſtingly.
                  
                  
                     That our whole hope, and the deſire of
our harte ought to be in God.
CHAPT. XXIII.
                     Bvt thou o Lord, the expectation of
Iſrael, the deſire after which our hart
                           •
                        
doth ſighe euery day, make haſt, and doe
not ſtay. Ariſe, make haſt, and come, and
deliuer vs out of this priſon, to confeſſe
vnto thy name, that we may glory and be
delighted in thy light. Open thine eares
to the dolefull clamours of thy driſtreſſed
children, who cry to thee, ſaying: O
our Father, giue vs this day our daily breade;
in the ſtrength of which, we may
walke day and night, vntill we attaine
vnto thy holy mountaine Oreb.
                     O God my Father and force, when
ſhall I (that am the leaſt of all thy family)
come and appeare before thy face, to the
end, that as I doe now praiſe thee during
the time of this mortalitie, I may from
thence for the praiſe thee euerlaſtinglie?
                     O how greate ſhall I eſteeme my happines,
if I ſhall at length be admitted to
beholde thy brightnes? Who will obtaine
this fauoure for me, that I may be

admitted to beholde thee? I knowe (o
Lord) I! knowe and confeſſe, that I am vnworthy
to enter into thy houſe; neuertheleſſe
I beſeech thee afforde me this fauour
for thy glorie, and confounde not thy
ſeruant, that truſteth in thee. But who is
able to enter into thy ſanctuarie to conſider
thy power, if thou (o Lord) doe not
open vnto him the dore? Or who can opē
it, if thou ſhutt it?
                     Verily noe man is able to erect that,
which thou doſt throwe downe: neither
is any one able to free him, whom thou
doſt putt in priſon. If thou withholde the
waters, all thinges become dry and withered:
againe if thou lett them looſe, they
will ouerwhelme the worlde. If thou
ſhouldeſt cauſe all thinges which thou
haſt created to returne to nothing, who
durſt condradict thee? Finallie there is
noe end of the goodnes of thy mercy, by
which thou haſt created all thinges, that it
hath pleaſed thee.
                     Thou (o maker of the worlde) haſt
made vs, vouchſafe likewiſe to gouerne
vs. Thou haſt created vs, deſpiſe vs not,
becauſe we are thy workmanſhip. Certainely
(o Lord our God) we that are little
wormes compoſed of durte and clay, cannot
enter into thy eternitie, vnleſſe thou
leade vs in, who haſt created all thinges of
nothing.
                  
                  
                     
                     That our Saluation is from God.
CHAPT. XXIV.
                     I therfore, that am the worke of thy
handes, will confeſſe vnto thee in thy
feare, for that I will not put my confidence
in my bowe, neither is my ſworde
the thing that ſhall ſaue me, but thy right
hande, and thy arme, and the light of thy
countenance.
                     Certainely I ſhoulde deſpaire, were it
not that thou art my hope, that haſt created
me, whoſe propertie is neuer to forſake
thoſe that hope in thee. Becauſe
thou art our Lord God, full of ſweetnes
and patience, mercifullie diſpoſing all
thinges. For whether we ſinne or ſinne
not, we are ſtill thy creatures, and thou
doſt ſtill eſteeme
                           •
                         and make accounte of
vs? Verily al of vs are as the leafe of a tree,
and euery man liuing is meerely vanitie,
ſoe that our life (whilſt we liue in this
worlde) is as a puffe of winde.
                     If we therefore thy poðre pupills chāce
to fall, be not offened, becauſe thou o
Lord our God knoweſt the brickle ſubſtance,
wherof we were made. Wilt thou
therfore (o God of ineſtimable fortitude)

ſhewe thy power againſt a leaſe, that with
euerie puſſe of winde is caried hither and
thither, or wilt thou perſecute a little ſtuble
or ſtrawe? Wilt thou o eternall king
of Iſrael) damne a dogge? Wilt thou
damne a flea? Wee hau
                           •
                         heard o Lord of
thy mercie, that thou art neither the author
of deathe, neither doſt thou reioyce
at the damnation of thoſe that die.
                     Wherfore I beſee
                           •
                        n thee o Lord, that
thou wilt not permit that, which thou haſt
not made, to haue the vpper hande of
me thy creature, whom thou haſt made.
For if thou doſt grieue at our damnation,
what doth hinder thee o Lord (that canſt
doe any thinge) from reioycing alwaies at
our ſaluation? Thou (o Lord) canſt ſaue
me if thou wilt, but I of my ſelf, although
I deſire it, cannot doe it.
                     The multitude of my miſeries is 
                           •
                        oe
greate, that albeit I haue a will to doe
well, yet I want power to performe. I
cannot deſire what is good, v
                           •
                        leſſe it be
thy will likewiſe; neither haue I power
to performe what I doe deſire, vnleſſe
thy power ſtrengthen me; ſometimes I
am vnwilling to doe that good which
I haue power to performe, were it not,
that thy will muſt be donne in earthe, as
it is in heauen.
                     Moreouer I knowe not what I am

willing or able to performe▪ vnleſſe thou
illuminate me with thy wiſedome. Yea
although I knowe what to doe, and
am willing and able to doe the ſame,
yet my wiſedome (for that it is imperfect
and vaine) doth leaue it vndonne, if
I be not ayded by thy true wiſedome.
                     All thinges therfore doe depende of
thy will, neither is any man able to withſtande
the ſame, who art Lord of all thinges,
and haſt power ouer euery particular
creature, effecting both in heauen and
earthe, in the ſea, and in bottomeleſſe
depthes, whatſoeuer ſeemeth good to
thy diuine pleaſure. Let thy ſacred will
therfore be fulfilled in vs, who doe call
vppon thy holy name to the end, that
this noble worke of thine, which thou
haſt created for thy glorie, doe not periſhe
euerlaſtinglie. For what man is there
borne of a woman, that is able to liue
and eſcape deathe and damnation, if thou
alone, (who art the liuing way of all life,
by whom all thinges liue and haue their
being) doe not deliuer him?
                  
                  
                     
                     How without the aſsiſtance of Gods
grace, mans will is vnable to
doe well.
CHAPT. XXV.
                     I haue alreadie acknowledged vnto thee
o Lord my God (who art the prayſe of
my life, and the force of my ſaluation)
that I did heeretofore truſt in my owne
vertue and ſtrength, which indeede was
not ſtrength, but rather preſumption. For
as long as I did runne on after that faſhiō,
I alwaies founde my ſelfe there moſt
fraile and ſubiect to fall, where I thought
my ſelfe moſt firme, ſoe that (by running
thus) I founde my ſelfe rather behinde
then before, for that the thinge was ſtill
further from me, which I thought to
ouertake by mine owne endeuoure. And
in this manner thou haſt in diuers thinges
made triall of my force.
                     Now I know o Lord (becauſe thou haſt
enlightned mine vnderſtanding) that
whatſoeuer I thought my ſelfe beſt able
to doe, I haue alwaies been leaſt able to
performe. I oftentimes ſaied, I will doe
this, or that, and yet in fine I did neither
of them. When I was willing to doe
any thing, I founde my ſelfe vnable,

and when I was able, I founde my ſelfe
vnwilling, becauſe I did preſume of mine
owne forces.
                     But nowe (o Lord my God, father of
heauen and earthe) I confeſſe vnto thee,
that noe man ought to vaunt in thy preſence,
as if he weare ſtrong through his
owne puiſſance: becauſe the preſumption
of all fleſhe is vaine and fooliſhe.
                     Verilie it lieth not in mans power to
deſire what he is able to doe, or to be able
to doe, what he doth deſire, or to knowe
what he ought to deſire, or is able to doe,
but rather the footeſtepps of men are
guided by thy diuine prouidence, the
footeſteps (I ſay) of thoſe who acknowledge
that they are guided by thee and not
of themſelues.
                     Wherefore we humbly beſeeche thee
by the bowels of thy mercy (o Lord) that
thou wilt ſaue what thou haſt created, becauſe
thou art able to ſaue vs, if thou art
willing, on whoſe onely will doth depēde
the merit of our ſaluation.
                  
                  
                     Of the ancient benefits of almighty
God.

                         Lord I beſeeche thee)
thy mercie ſhewed towardes vs of

old time, through which thou haſt preuented
vs with the bleſſings of thy ſweetnes,
euen from the beginninge. For thou
(o Lord and my hope) from the verie time
that I was a ſuckling (yea before I was
borne) haſt prouided and prepared the
waies, that I ſhould walke in, and by
them attaine to the glorie of thy heauenly
habitation. Thou haſt knowen me before
thou didſt forme me in my mothers

                           •
                        llie, and before I iſſued forthe of the
wombe of my mother, thou haſt preordained
of me, whatſoeuer ſeemed good to
thy diuine pleaſure.
                     I knowe not (o Lord) what thinges are
written of me in thy booke, in the ſecret
of thy conſiſtorie, which make
                           •
                        h me to
feare exceedingly: but thou knoweſt them
all particularlie, becauſe that which I expect
by ſucceſſion of daies and times a
thouſand yeares hence to be fulfilled, in
the ſight of thy eternitie is already accompliſhed,
and that which is to come, is alreadie
donne. But I for that I knowe not
theſe thinges (liuing heere as it were in a
darke and obſcure night) cannot but feare
and tremble, whilſt I ſee ſondrie dangers
on euerie ſide aſſaulting me, troupes of ennimies
pourſuing me, and the infinite miſeries
of this life enuironning me.
                     And were it not that the ayde of thy

grace doth ſuccoure me in theſe my manifolde
tribulations, I ſhould ſoone fall into
deſperation. But I haue a great hope and
confidence (o my God) in thee, who art a
Prince of vnſpeakeable pittie, and the
conſideration of thy infinite mercies, are
noe ſmall comforte vnto me in my miſeries.
                     The former tokens likewiſe of thy loue
and mercie, ſhewed towardes me before
my natiuitie, but appearing now eſpeciallie,
doe put me in hope for the time
to come, to receiue more ample and greater
fauoures from the handes of thy bountifull
libe

                        alitie▪ which thou doſt reſerue
for thy friendes and thoſe that loue thee
to the end, that my hope may reioyce in
thee (o Lord my God) with a ſacred and
liuelie cherefulnes, with which thou doſt
continuallie comforte my younge and
tender yeares.
                  
                  
                     Of the Angells appointed to be the
guardians of man.
CHAPT. XXVII.
                     Thou haſt loued me (o my onely loue)
before I loued thee, and haſt created
me according to thine owne likenes,
making me Lord and ruler ouer all thy

other creatures. Which dignitie I then
poſſeſſe, when I know thee, for whom
thou haſt made me.
                     Moreouer thou cauſeſt thoſe heauenlie
ſpirits for my ſake to become meſſengers,
to whom thou haſt giuen commaundement
to protect and guarde me in
all my actions, that I hurte not my foote
againſt a ſtone.
                     Theſe are the watchmen that keep
                           •
                        
continuall ſentinell vpon the walls of thy
cittie new Hieruſalem, guarding the moū
                        taines
likewiſe that are rounde about it,
keeping watch by night ouer thy flocke,
leaſt that old ſerpent our aduerſarie the
diuell, as a Lion ſhoulde kill and deſtroy
our ſoules (if there were none to deſende
them) who as a roaring Lion continuallie
rangeth about, ſeeking whom he may
deuoure.
                     Theſe are the cittizens of our mother
aboue, the bleſſed and celeſtiall cittie
Hieruſalem, who art ſent to ſerue and attende
on thoſe, that are preordained by
God to inherite the kingdome of heauen,
that they may deliuer them from theire
ennimies, and guarde them in all theire
waies, that they may comforte and admoniſhe
them, and in the preſence of thy glorious
Maieſtie, may offer vp the prayers of
thy children. Vndoubtedlie they doe loue

their fellowe cittizens expecting by them
the reparation of theire ruines.
                     Wherefore at all times, and in all places,
with great ca
                           •

and ſupplying our neceſſities, paſſing inceſſantly
to and fro betwixt thee (o Lord)
and vs, relatinge our groanes and ſighes
vnto thee, to the end they may obtaine,
for vs fauoure and courteſie, and may
bring to vs the deſired bleſſing of thy grace
and mercie.
                     In all our wayes they walke with vs, entring
in and going for the with vs, conſidering
with great attention how religiouſly
and laudably we behaue our ſelues in the
midſt of a peruerſe nation, with what care
and diligence wee ſeeke thy kingdome &
the iuſtice thereof, with how greate feare
and trembling we ſerue thee, and with
how greate ioy and mirthe of 
                           •
                        harte we
ſing vnto thee.
                     When we laboure, they ayde vs; when
we, reſt they protect vs: when we fight,
they encourage vs: when we conquerre,
they crowne vs: when we reioyce (if our
ioy be of thee) they reioyce with vs: when
we ſuffer (if our ſufferings be for thee)
they ſuffer together with vs.
                     Greate is the care which they haue of
vs, and greate is the effect of theire loue

towardes vs: All which reſpect and lou
                           •
                        
they ſhew vs, in reſpect of the vnſpeakable
loue, with which thou haſt loued vs.
Verilie they loue thoſe, that thou loueſt,
they preſerue thoſe that thou preſerueſt,
and forſake thoſe that thou forſakeſt, neither
can they endure thoſe that committ
ſinne, becauſe thou they ſelf doſt hate thoſe
that commit ſinne, and wilt deſtroy all
thoſe that delight in lying.
                     As often as we doe well, the Angells
are glad, and the diuells are ſad. But
when we doe ill, we make the diuel merrie,
and depriue the holy Angells of their
                           •
                        
ioy. Becauſe they reioyce to ſee a ſinner
doe pennāce when he hath ſinned: wheras
contrarie wiſe, the diuell reioyceth to
ſee a iuſt man irrepentant when he hath
offended.
                     Wherefore (o father I beſeeche thee)
afford
                           •
                         them this fauoure, that they may
alwaies reioyce in reſpect of vs, to the
end that both thou by them maieſt perpetuallie
be prayſed in vs, and we with them
may be made one folde in the kingdome
of heauen: that ſoe we may together
prayſe thy holie name, o creator of men
and Angells.
                     When I call theſe thinges to memorie,
I confeſſe (o Lord) that I haue great cauſe
to prayſe and magnifie thee, for that theſe

thy benefits are verie greate, with which
thou haſt honoured vs, by cauſing thy
Angells (who are ſpirits) to ſerue and attende
vs.
                     Verily thou hadſt beſtowed vpon vs before,
whatſoeuer is contained within the
compaſſe of heauen, and yet thou didſt
imagin all thinges that are vnder heauen
to be a guift of ſmall eſtimation, if thou
ſhouldeſt not likewiſe add thoſe that are
aboue the heauens.
                     Let all thy Angells (o Lord) for! this
thy goodnes prayſe thee, let al thy workes
acknowledge and confeſſe the ſame vnto
thee, and let all thy Saints extoll thee
euerlaſtinglie. Thou haſt honoured vs exceedingly
(o Lord God our honoure) enriching
and adorning vs with manifolde
guiftes and fauoures: ſoe that thy name is
admired in the vniuerſall worlde. What
is man then that thou doſt thus exalt him,
or for what cauſe doſt thou place thine affection
vppon him?
                     True it is, that thou (o ancient truthe)
haſt ſaied: My delightes are to be with
the children of men. But why (o Lord)
or for what reaſon? Is man any thing els
but corruption? or the ſonne of man any
thing els, but a worme? Is not euery man
liuing in this vale of miſerie, either enclined,
or wholy addicted to vanity? Whence

is it then that thou doſt vouchſafe ſoe gr
                           •
                        
                        ciouſlie
to looke vppon him, and to bring
him and make him ſit with thee in iudgment
at the day of doome?
                  
                  
                     Of the profounde Predeſtination and
foreknowledge of almighty
God.
CHAPT. XXVIII.
                     O Moſt profounde depth, o infinite
wiſedome, that haſt created all thinges,
vouchſafe to teache and inſtruct me,
who haſt poiſed the mountaines and hills
in a paire of weightes, and the huge and
heauie lumpe of the whole earthe in a
paire of ballances, lifting it vp with three
fingers onely: lift vp likewiſe vnto thee
with the ſame three fingers (I beſeeche
thee) the heauie lumpe of my mortallitie,
that I may ſee and vnderſtande how wonderfully
thou art to be admired in the vniuerſall
worlde.
                     O moſt ancient light, who before all
light didſt ſhine and giue light on the holie
hills of thy ancient eternitie, to whom
all thinges, before theire creation, were
knowen moſt apparantly.
                     O light, that hateſt all ſpot of ſinne, for
that thou art moſt pure and cleane, what

pleaſure haſt thou to conuerſe with man?
What hath light to doe with darknes?
Where are thy delightes in man? Where
haſt thou prepared for thy ſelfe in me a
ſanctuarie, fitting ſoe greate a Maieſtie, in
which thou maieſt finde pleaſure and delight
at thy comminge?
                     Verily we ought to prouide for thee a
cleane habitation, who art that vertue
that makeſt all thinges cleane, who of
ſuch as are vncleane in harte, canſt not ſoe
much as be ſeene, much leſſe canſt thou
be contained in them. Where then can
there be founde in man, a temple ſoe free
from filthe, as that it may be thought
worthy to receiue thee, who ruleſt the
whole earthe? Who is able to cleanſe him
that is conceiued in vncleanneſſe, ſauing
thou alone, who art onely free from bleamiſhe?
who can be cleanſed by one tha
                           •
                        
is defiled?
                     For according to the lawe, which thou
haſt giuen to our fore-fathers (ſpeaking
vnto them out of the fire burninge the
mountaine, and out of the darke and miſtie
cloude) whatſoeuer he toucheth that
is vncleane, ſhalbe eſteemed vncleane.
All of vs therefore being noe better then
filthie raggs, takinge our beginning
                           •
                        
from a loathſome maſſe of filthie corruption,
doe carrie in our foreheades, the

ſtaine of our vncleannes, which we cannot
conceale by any meanes, eſpecially from
thee, that ſeeſt all thinges.
                     We therfore cannot be cleane and free
from ſinne, vnleſſe thou cleanſe vs, who
art onelie cleane and free from the ſame▪
For thou art not accuſtomed to cleanſe all
the children of men, but thoſe onely,
that it pleaſeth thee to dwell in, whom
thou by the vnſearcheable profounde ſecrets
of the incomprehenſible iuſt (yet ſecret)
iudgments of thy wiſedome, without
any deſert of theirs, haſt predeſtinated
before the beginning of the worlde,
haſt called out of the worlde, haſt iuſtified
in the world, meaning likewiſe to magnifie
them after the end of the worlde. Neuertheleſſe
thou doſt not impart this ineſtimable
fauoure to euerie one, which
maketh the carnall and worldly wiſemen
to pine away through admiration.
                     As for me, I confeſſe (o Lord) that
when I enter into conſideration of this, I
cannot but tremble and be aſtonied at the
greatnes of the riches of thy wiſedome
and knowledge, vnto which I cannot attaine,
neither vnto the incomprehenſible
iudgments of thy iuſtice: ſithence that of
the ſame lumpe of clay, thou doſt forme
ſome veſſels vnto glorie, others vnto euerlaſting
contumelie.
                     
                        
Thoſe therfore, that thou haſt choſen
for thy ſelfe amonge ſo many to be thy
temple and ſanctuarie, thoſe thou doſt
waſhe cleare by powring vppon them the
pure water of thy holy Spirit, whoſe names
and number thou knoweſt (who
onely art able to number the innumerable
multitude of the ſtarrs, calling them
all by their names, who likewiſe are
written in the booke of life, and cannot
poſſibly periſhe: towardes whoſe
good, all thinges doe cooperate, euen
theire verie ſinnes: For if they chance to
fall, they take noe hurte, becauſe thou
doſt vphold them with thy hande preſeruing
all their bones, ſoe that noe one of
them is broken.
                     Contrariewiſe the deathe of ſinners is
the worſt of all others, of thoſe ſinners (I
ſay) whom, according to the bottomles
depthe of thy hidden (yet alwaies iuſt)
iudgments, thou haſt foreknowen ſhould
be damned, euen before heauen and earth
were created: the number of whoſe
names and enormious actions, remaine
regiſtred with thee, who haſt numbred
the verie ſande of the ſea, and meaſur

                        d
the profonditie of the bottomles
depthe, whom thou haſt left in theire vncleannes;
all thinges likewiſe doe cooperate
towardes their damnation, and their

very prayers are turned into ſinne, ſoe that
albeit the

                         haue ſoared up to the heauens,
and their heade had ouched the cloudes,
althoughe they haue built theire neſt amongſt
the ſtarrs of heauen, yet finally
they ſhalbe caſt downe as a dunghill, to
eternall damnation.
                  
                  
                     Of thoſe that at firſt are good, and after
Wardes become bad: and contrarie
Wiſe of thoſe that at first are bad,
and after Wardes become good.
CHAPT. XXIX.
                     GReate are theſe thy iudgments, o
Lord God, o iudge moſt iuſt and
mightie, whoſe iudgments are equitie it
ſelfe, whoſe doings are profounde and
vnſearcheable, which when I conſider,
all my bones doe tremble: becauſe man
(a longe as he liueth in this worlde) is not
aſſured that he ſhalbe ſaued, to the end,
that during the whole courſe of our life,
we might deuoutly and chaſtly with feare
ferue thee and with trembling reioyce before
th
                           •
                        e; that our ſeruice might not be
without feare, nor our ioy without trembling▪
that he that is yet in battaile might
not boaſt before the victorie, that no

mortall man might vaunt before thee, but
ſhoulde rather ſtande in thy preſence with
great feare and dreade, ſeeing man knoweth
not before his laſt day, whether he be
worthy of loue or hatred, vntill
                           •
                         which
time all thinges are kept ſecret, and as it
were vndetermined.
                     For we (o Lord) haue ſeeene many ourſelues,
and hearde of many more by the
relation of our fore-fathers (which is a
thing which I cannot call to minde and
declare, without great trembling & much
feare) who at firſt haue ſoared vp as it
were to the skies, and built theire neſt
among the ſtarres, but afterwardes they
haue tumbled downe headlong, and their
ſoules haue been amazed at the euills that
haue hapned vnto them.
                     We haue ſ
                           •
                        ene ſtarres that haue fallen
from heauen by force of the Dragons tayle
ſtriking them. We haue likewiſe ſeene
(o Lord) thoſe that lay groucling on the
grounde, to haue beene highlie exalted
by meanes of thy helpinge hande. We
haue beheld the liuing to die, & the deade
rayſed to life againe, and thoſe that walked
amongſt the children of God amidſt
the fierie ſtones, like durte to haue come
to nothing. We haue ſeene light changed
into darknes, and light proceedinge
out of darknes, becauſe publicans and

harlotts, goe before the inhabitants in the
kingdome of heauen: but the children of
the kingdome, are caſt forthe into exteriour
darknes.
                     But what is the cauſe of all theſe thinges?
vnleſſe, for that they preſume by
theire owne endeuoures to aſcende vnto
that hill, vnto which, he that firſt attēpted
to aſcende, went vp an Angell, and
came downe a diuell.
                     As for thoſe, that thou haſt predeſtinated,
thou haſt likewiſe called them,
and ſanctified them, and cleanſed them,
that they may be a habitation fitting for
thy maieſtie to dwell in, with whom and
in whom are thy ſacred and pure delightes;
in whom thou doſt take pleaſure, making
glad theire young and tender yeares,
dwelling in theire memorie, and ſoe making
thē thy ſanctuarie, which is a greate
ſetting forth of our dignitie, and a ſingular
commendation of our humanitic.
                  
                  
                     That a faithfull ſoule is the ſanctuarie
of God.
CHAPT. XXX.
                     OVr ſoule which thou (o Lord) haſt
created not of thine owne ſubſtāce,
but by thy worde, not of any elementarie

ſubſtance, but of nothing (which is reaſonnable
intellectuall, ſpirituall, alwaies
liuing, alwaies in motion, whom thou
haſt ſigned and marked with the light of
thy countenance, and conſecrated by the
vertue of holy baptiſme) hath been made
capable of thy Maieſtie in that manner, as
that it can be ſatisfied and filled by thee
onely, and by nothing els whatſoeuer.
                     When it hath thee, the deſire thereof
is ſatisfied, ſoe that there remaineth noe
outwarde thinge that may be deſired. As
long therfore as it affecteth any outwarde
thing, it is a manifeſt proofe, that it hath
not thee within, who being gotten and
obtayned, noe other ought to be deſired.
For ſeeing thou art the ſupreame and total
good, there remaineth nothing els that it
can deſire, becauſe it poſſeſſeth thee the
ſole ſufficient good. But if it deſireth not
the ſ
                           •
                        le ſufficient good, it followeth that
it deſireth ſomething, that is not the ſupreame
good, and conſequently not God,
but ſome creature.
                     When therefore it deſireth ſome creature,
it hath continuall hunger, for albeit
it obtaineth the creature, that it deſireth,
yet neuertheleſſe it remaineth emptie
and voide, becauſe there is nothing, that
can fill it beſides thee, according to whoſe
image it was created.
                     
                        
But thou (o Lord) doſt fill thoſe that
deſire nothing els but thee, making them
worthy of thee, that is, making them
holy, bleſſed, pure, and the friends of
God, who eſteeme all thinges, as dung,
that they may gaine thee alone. This is
that happines, which thou haſt imparted
vnto man, this is the honoure, with which
amongſt all other creatures, and aboue
all other creatures, thou haſt honoured
him, to the end that thy name might be
admired in the whole worlde.
                     Beholde o Lord my God, moſt highe,
moſt good, and moſt omnipotent, I haue
founde the place where thou doſt dwell,
to wit, in the ſoule, (which thou haſt created,
according to thine owne image and
ſimilitude,) which doth ſeeke and deſire
thee only, becauſe thou doſt not dwell in
that ſoule, which doth not ſeeke and deſire
thee.
                  
                  
                     How God cannot be founde, either by
the exteriour or interiour ſenſes.
CHAPT. XXXI.
                     I Haue wandered to and fro (o my God)
like a loſt ſheep, ſeeking thee without,
who art within. I haue likewiſe laboured
exceedingly, ſeeking thee without me,

and thou (if I truly deſire thee) dwelleſt
within me. I haue walked about the ſtreetes
and highe wayes of the cittie of this
worlde, ſeeking thee, but coulde not finde
thee, becauſe I ſought thee amiſſe thinking
to finde that outwardly, which is
within me. I ſeut all my exteriour ſenſes
as meſſengers to ſeeke thee, but coulde
not finde thee, becauſe I tooke not the
true courſe in ſeeking thee.
                     Now I plainely perceiue (o my light,
my God, who haſt enlightned me) that I
ſought thee amiſſe by them, for that thou
art within, and yet they knowe not,
which way thou haſt entred in. For mine
eies ſay: if he be voide of coloure, he hath
not entred in by vs. The cares ſay: he
made noe noiſe at his entraunce, he hath
not entred by vs. The noſe ſayeth: if he
gaue noe ſmell, he came not by me. The
taſte ſayeth: if he haue noe taſte, he entred
not in by me. The feeling likewiſe
affirmeth: if he be not a ſolid bodie ſubiect
to touching, it is in vaine to demaūde
of me any ſuche queſtion.
                     None of theſe thinges therfore are
founde in thee (o my God) For when I
ſeeke my God▪ I doe not ſeeke comelines
of bodie, or ſeemelines of time, or brightnes
of light, or melodious tunes, or ſweete
ſounding Muſique, or the odoriferous

ſmells of flowers, and ointments, or of
aromaticall ſpices. I doe not ſ
                           •
                        eke honie,
or manna that are delightfull to the taſte,
nor any other thing, that is amiable to be
touched or embraced: finallie when I
ſeeke my God, I doe not ſeeke any thing
ſubiect to theſe exteriour ſenſes aforeſaide.
                     God forbid, I ſhoulde imagine any of
thoſe thinges to be my creator, which are
comprehended after the ſame manner by
the ſenſes of ſenſles & brutiſhe creatures.
And yet notwithſtanding, when I ſeeke
my God, I
                           •
                         ſeeke a certaine light ſurpaſſing
all other light, which the eie cannot ſee.
I ſeeke a certaine voice ſurmounting an
other voices, which the care cannot heare.
I ſeeke a certaine ſmell, excelling all
other ſmels, which the noſe cannot ſmell.
I ſeeke a certaine ſweetnes, more delightfull
then any other ſweetnes, which
the taſte cannot perceiue. I ſeeke a certaine
touching or embracing, more pleaſing
then any other touching or embracing,
which is altogether vnknowen to
the feeling.
                     This light ſhineth, where the place
doth no
                           •
                         containe it: this voyce ſoundeth,
where the ayre doth not hinder it: this
ſweete ſauioure ſmelleth, where the wind
doth not diſperſe it: the pleaſantnes of

this diuine diſhe is taſted, where there is
noe eating: this embracing is felt, where
there is noe ſeparation.
                     This is my God, neither is there any
other like vnto him. This is that which I
ſeeke, when I ſeeke my God. This is the
thinge I loue, when I loue my God. Too
too late haue I loued thee, o beautie moſt
old and newe, too too late (I ſay) haue
I loued thee; Thou truly didſt remaine
within me, and yet I remained without,
ſeeking thee; ſoe that I became deformed
by being ouermuch affected to thoſe faire
thinges which thou haſt created. Thou
was preſent with me, and I was not preſent
with thee. Thoſe thinges debarred
me from thee, which coulde not ſubſiſt
but by thee.
                     I went to 
                           •
                        uerie thing ſeeking thee,
and by meanes of them looſing my ſelfe.
I asked the earthe, if it were my God, and
it anſwered noe; the like did all other
thinges contained in 
                           •
                        it▪ I asked the ſea,
and the bottomles depthes, and all manne,
of creatures contained in them, and
they anſwered. We are not thy God, ſeeke
him aboue vs. I asked the blowing aire,
who together with all the inhabitants
thereof anſwered, Anaximines is deceiued,
I am not thy God. I asked the ſame
queſtion of the firmament, of the ſunne,

moone, and ſtarrs; who gaue me the ſame
anſwere. I asked againe of all theſe aforeſaid
that ſtood round about me. You
haue tolde me, that you are not my God,
at leaſt ſay ſomething of him: and they all
cried out with a loude voice:, It is he that
hath made vs.
                     After this I asked the wide and ſpatious
worlde. Tell me, if thou be my God, or
not? Who anſwered with a ſtrong voice:
I am not thy God, but a creature created
by him: he whom thou ſeekeſt in me, hath
created me, ſeeke him aboue me, who at
this preſent doth gouerne me, and heeretofore
hath made me.
                     This demaunde and conference made
with other creatures, is a deepe conſideration
of them, and theire anſwere is the
teſtimonie which they giue of God, for
that they all affirme, that God hath made
them: Becauſe as the Apoſtle ſaieth,
the inuiſible thinges of God, are vnderſtood
and ſeene, by thoſe things that
are donne, of the creatures of the
worlde.
                     After this I returned vnto my ſelfe, and
entring into my ſelfe, I vſed with my ſelfe
this diſcourſe: Who art thou? And I anſwered
vnto my ſelfe: I am a mortal man,
endewed with reaſon: And I begā to examine,
what this was, ſaying: Whence (o

Lord my God) hath this creature his beginning?
whence (I ſay) vnleſſe from thee?
Thou haſt made me, and not I my ſelfe.
Who art thou then? Who art thou, by▪
whom I and all other thinges doe liue,
and haue theire being? Who art thou?
Thou (o Lord my God) art the true and
onely God, omnipotent and eternall, infinite
and incomprehenſible: who liueſt
euerlaſtingly, and nothing dieth in thee,
becauſe thou art immortall, dwelling in a
place that ſhall continue worlde without
end, admirable in the eies of the Angells,
vnſpeakeable, vnſearcheable, and not to
be named.
                     Thou art the liuing and true God, terrible
& powerfull, not knowing beginning
or end, the beginning and end of all thinges;
who art before the beginning and originall
of all generations, worldes, ages and
times. Thou art my God, the Lord of all
thinges, which thou haſt created. Thou
knoweſt the cauſes of all thinges that are
ſtable, thou knoweſt the immutable beginnings
of all thinges that are mutable, thou
knoweſt the eternall reaſons of all thinges
reaſonnable, vnreaſonnable and tēporall.
                     Tell me then (o my God) thy poore
vnworthy ſeruant, thou that art full of
mercie, tell me that am full of miſerie, for
thy mercies ſake, tell me I beſeeche thee.

Whence had man his beginning, but frō
thee? Was there euer any man that coulde
vaunt to haue been the author of his
owne creation? Is it not from thee alone,
that we haue our life and being? Art not
thou the chiefe being, from whom eue
                           •
                        ie
thing hath his beginning? For whatſoeuer
is, is from thee, becauſe without thee
there is nothing. Art not thou the fountaine
of life, from whom floweth all life?
Becauſe wha
                           •
                        ſoeuer liueth, liueth by thee,
for that nothing liueth without thee.
                     Thou therfore (o Lord) haſt made all
thinges. Shall I then demaund who made
me? Thou haſt made me (o Lord) without
whom nothing was made. Thou art my
Creator, I am thy creature.
                     I giue thee thankes (o Lord my God by
Whom I, and all other thinges doe liue)
for that thou haſt created me. I giue thee
thankes (o my maker) for that thy handes
haue made me, and faſhioned me. I giue
thee thankes (o my light) for that thou
haſt enlightned me, by which meanes I
haue found both thee and my ſelfe. Wher
I haue found my ſelfe, there I haue knowen
my ſelfe; where I haue found thee,
there I haue knowen thee: and where I
haue knowen thee, there thou haſt enlightned
me. I giue thee thankes (o my
light) for that thou haſt enlightned me.
                     
                        
But what is that which I haue ſaied, I
haue knowen thee? Art not thou an incomprehenſible
& infinite God, the King
of Kings, and Lord of Lords, who dwelleſt
alone in immortalitie, and in that light,
which noe man can attaine vnto: which
noe man hath euer ſeene, or can poſſiblie
ſee? Art not thou a hidden God, and of
vnſearcheable maieſty, who 
                           •
                        onely art able
to knowe and contemplate the greatnes
and wonderfulnes of thine owne excellencie?
Who then hath knowen, that
which he hath neuer ſeene? Becauſe thou
haſt ſaied in thy truth: Man ſhall not ſee
me, and liue. Thy Apoſtle likewiſe hath
ſaied by thy truthe: Noe man hath euer
ſeene God Who then hath knowen that,
which he hath not ſeene? Thy truth in like
manner hath affirmed: Noe one hath
knowen the ſonne, but the Father; neither
hath any one knowen the Father, but the
ſōne. Thy ſole Trinitie therfore is wholy
knowen to thy ſelfe alone, which ſurpaſſeth
all vnderſtanding.
                     How durſt I then (that am a man like
vnto vanitie) affirme, that I haue know
                           ••

                        e? For who hath knowen thee, beſides
thy ſelfe? Becauſe thou onely art God almightie,
moſt worthy to be prayſed, moſt
glorious, moſt highe, and aboue all others
to be exalted, who in the ſacred and diuine

ſcriptures art ſaied to be ſupereſſentiall:
For that thou art knowen to be ſupereſſentially
and ſuperintelligibly aboue
all eſſence intelligible, intellectuall or ſenſible,
& aboue euerie name that is named
either in this worlde, or in the next; becauſe
by thy ſupereſſentiall and hidden
diuinitie, thou doſt inacceſſibly and vnſearcheably,
dwell in thy ſelfe aboue all
reaſon, vnderſtanding and eſſence, where
there is inacceſſible light, and vnſearcheable,
incomprehenſible and vnſpeakeable
brightnes, vnto which no brightnes is able
to arriue: becauſe it is thought to exceed
the boundes of all humaine contemplation,
vnſeene, beyonde humaine reaſon &

man can attaine vnto it: moſt free likewiſe
from mutation, and not to be imparted
to any one: Which neither was, nor
can poſſibly at any time be ſeene, by either
Angells or men.
                     This is thy heauen (o Lord) thy heauen
that is carued and garniſhed, that hidden
and ſupereſſentiall brightnes, ſurpaſſing

                        ll vnderſtanding and reaſon, of whom it
is ſaied: The heauen of heauen belonging
to our Lord. The heauen of heauē, in conpariſon
of which, all the other heauens,
are but as it were the earth, for that it
is exala
                           •

of this the heauen called

                           aelum Empyreum
is but as it were the earthe; for this is the
heauen of heauen belonging to our Lord,
becauſe it is knowen to noe other but to
our Lord. Into which noe man hath euer
aſcended, but he, that hath deſcended
from heauen: for that noe man hath
knowen the Father, but the Sonne, and
the holy Ghoſt proceeding from both of
them. Neither hath any one knowen the
Sonne, but the Father, and the holy Ghoſt
proceeding from both of them.
                     Certainely the Trinitie is wholy knowē
to thee onely, o holy Trinitie, o Trinitie
moſt admirable, moſt vnſpeakeable, moſt
vnſearcheable, moſt inacceſſible, moſt incomprehenſible,
ſuperintelligible, and ſupereſſentiall,

                     How then haue I knowen thee, o Lord
God moſt highe aboue all the earth and

of him that ſitteth vpon the high and loftie
throne, they cry out with a loude voice,
ſaying. Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God
of hoſtes. All the earth is full of thy glory.
                     The Prophet was afraied and ſaied;
Woe be to me, for that I haue beene ſilent,
becauſe I am a man of vncleane lipps.
My harte likewiſe hath beene affrayed,
and ſaied. Woe be to me, for that I haue
not beene ſilent, becauſe I am a man of
vncleane lipps. I cannot denie, but that I
haue affirmed, that I haue knowen thee.
Neuertheleſſe, woe be to thoſe, who ſpeak
not of thee, becauſe without thy ayde and
aſſiſtance, thoſe that ſpeake much would
become ſpeecheleſſe.
                     Wherfore (o Lord my God) I will not
be ſilent, becauſe thou haſt made me, and
enlightned me, by which meanes I haue
founde my ſelfe, and knowen thee. But
how haue I knowen thee? I haue knowen
thee in thy ſelfe, I haue knowen thee,
not as thou art to thy ſelfe, but as thou
art to me: not without thee, but in thee,
becauſe thou art the light, which haſt enlightned
me. For euen as thou art onely
knowen to thy ſelfe, as thou art to thy
ſelfe: ſoe thou art knowen to me, according
as by thy grace thou art to me.
                     But what art thou to me? Tell me (o
mercifull Lord) thy poore and wretched

ſeruant, tell me for thy mercies ſake I beſeech
thee, what art thou to me? Say
vnto my ſoule, I am thy ſaluation: hide
not away thy face from me, leaſt I dye.
Suffer me (albeit I am but earthe & aſhes)
to ſpeake vnto thy mercy, ſuffer me (I ſay)
to ſpeake vnto thy mercy, becauſe thy
mercy is greate towardes me. I will therfore
preſume to ſpeake vnto my Lord, albeit
I am but duſt and aſhes. Tell me (o
mercifull Lord) thy poore and wretched
ſeruaunt, tell me for thy mercies ſake I beſeeche
thee, what art thou to me? Whervpon
thou haſt thundered with a greate
voyce from aboue into the internall
eare of my harte, and haſt cured my deafnes,
ſoe that I haue hearde thy voyce: thou
haſt likewiſe enlightned my blindnes, and
I haue ſeene thy light, and knowen thee
to be my God.
                     For this cauſe I affirmed, that I haue
knowen thee. I haue knowen thee to be
my God. I haue knowen thee to be the
onely true God, and Ieſus Chriſt, whom
thou haſt ſent.
                     There was a time, when I did not know
thee. Woe be to that time, when I did
not knowe thee: woe be to that blindnes,
when I did not ſee thee: woe be to that
deafnes, when I did not heare thee: when
I became blinde, deae, and deformed, by

ouermuch affectinge thoſe faire things
which thou haſt framed.
                     Thou (o Lord) wert with me, and I
was not with thee, becauſe thoſe thinges
did keepe me away from thee, which had
noe being, but in thee. Thou haſt enlightned
me, o light of the worlde, and I haue
ſeene thee and loued thee: Becauſe noe
man loueth thee, but he that ſeethe thee,
and noe man ſeethe thee, but he that loueth
thee.
                     Too late haue I loued thee (o beautie
moſt old and new) to to late haue I loued
thee. Woe be to that time when I haue
not loued thee.

CHAPT. XXXII.
                     I Giue thee thankes, o my light, who
haſt enlightned me, & I haue knowen
thee. But how haue I knowen thee? I
haue knowen thee to be the onely liuing
and true God, and my creator. I haue
knowen thee to be the maker of heauen
and earthe, of all thinges viſible and inuiſible,
to be true God, omnipotent, immortall,
and inuiſible, hauing neither boundes,
nor limits, eternall, inacceſſible, incomprehenſible,
vnſearcheable, immutable,

vnſpeakeably greate, yea infinite, the
beginning of all viſible and inuiſible creatures,
by whom all thinges are made, by
whom all the elements are preſerued and
maintained. Whoſe maieſtie, like as it
had neuer beginning, ſoe it ſhall neuer,
haue ending.
                     I haue knowen thee to be one onely
true God, the euerlaſting Father, Sonne,
and holy Ghoſt, three perſonnes indeede,
yet but one onely ſimple eſſence, and indiuiſible
nature: the Father from none, the
Sonne from the Father alone, the holy
Ghoſt proceeding equallie from the Father
and the Sonne: being alwaies without
beginning, or ending▪ one onely God
in three perſonnes, true God almighty,
the ſole beginning of all thinges, the creator
of all thinges viſible and inuiſible, ſpirituall
and temporall. Who by thy omnipotent
power in the beginninge when
time firſt beganne, didſt create of nothing
both creatures at once the ſpirituall and
corporall, to wit Angells and creatures of
the worlde, and after that man, conſiſting
of a bodie and ſoule, as one common to
both of them
                     I haue knowen thee, and confeſſe thee
to be true God the Father vnbegotten,
the ſonne begotten of the Father, the holie
Ghoſt the comforter, neither begotten,

neither vnbegotten, the ſacred and
vnſeparable Trinitie, in three perſonnes,
coequall, conſubſtantiall, and coeternall,
Trinitie in vnitie, and vnitie in Trinitie,
which I belieue in my harte for my iuſtification,
and confeſſe with my mouthe
for the attaining of ſaluation.
                     I haue knowen thee Ieſus Chriſt our
Lord the onely begotten ſonne of God, to
be true God, the creator, ſauiour and redeemer
of me, and all mankinde, whom
I confeſſe to haue beene borne of the father
before all worldes God of God, light
of light, verie God, of verie God, not
made but begotten, conſubſtantiall and
coeternall to the father & the holy Ghoſt,
by whom all thinges were made from the
beginning, firmely belieuing; and vnfainedly
confeſſing thee Ieſus Chriſt the only
begotten ſonne of the father to be true
God▪ by the cōmon conſent of the whole
Trinitie, taking fleſhe vppon thee for the
ſaluation of man, and by the cooperation
of the holy Ghoſt conceiued of thy bleſſed
mother Marie euer a Virgin, being
made true man of a reaſonnable ſoule,
and humaine fleſhe ſubſiſting. Who al be it
thou art the onely begotten ſonne of God,
and conſequently impaſſible and immortall
according to thy diuinitie: yet by reaſon
of the vnſpeakeable loue, wherewith

thou haſt loued vs, thou the ſame ſonne
of God, haſt become paſſible and mortall
according to thy humanitie.
                     Thou (I ſay) o onely Sonne of God,
for mans ſaluation haſt vouchſafed to endure
a moſt bitter death & paſſion, to the
end thou mighteſt deliuer vs from death
euerlaſting. Thou likewiſe (o author of
light) haſt deſcended into hell, where our
forefathers did ſit in darknes, and haſt returned
from thence on the third day as a
glorious conquerour, reſuming againe thy
ſacred bodie, which for our ſinnes had remained
deade in the ſepulcher, and reuiuing
it the third day accordinge to the
ſcripture, that thou mighteſt place it in
glorie at the right hande of God the father.
For hauinge deliuered thoſe from
captiuitie, whom the ancient foe and ennimie
of mankind hath detained as priſoners
in 
                              •
                           imbo Patrum, thou the true ſonne
of God, haſt aſcended aboue all the heauens
with the ſubſtance of our fleſh, that
is with a ſoule and humaine fleſh, taken
of the glorious Virgin: mounting aboue
all the orders of Angells, where thou ſitteſt
at the right hande of God the Father,
where there is the fountaine of life, and
that light vnto which noe creature can attaine,
where there is the peace of God,
which paſſeth all vnderſtanding.
                     
                        
We adore thee Ieſus Chriſt, belieuing
thee to be there, confeſſinge God to be
thy Father: from whence we expect thee
to come at the end of the worlde to iudge
both the quicke and the deade, and to
render to all men, whether good or euill,
a rewarde or puniſhment, accordinge to
theire actions donne in this life, like as
euery one ſhalbe deemed worthy either
of perpetuall peace or paine. For all men,
that haue receiued a humaine ſoule, ſhall
ariſe at that day in the ſame fleſhe, which
they had heere; being by the voice of
thy diuine power ſummoned to appeare;
to the end, that euerie man (his ſoule and
body being reunited in one) may according
to his meritts, receiue ether glorie or
damnation.
                     Thou (o Lord Ieſus Chriſt) art our life,
and our reſurrection: whom we expect,
as our Sauiour to come and ſaue vs, who
wilt reforme the bodie of our baſenes,
making it conformable to the bodie of
thy brightnes.
                     I haue knowen thee true God, and one
holy Spirit of the Father and the Sonne,
proceeding equallie from both of them,
conſubſtantiall and coeternall to the Father
and the Sonne, being our comforter
and aduocate: who in likenes of a doue
haſt deſcended vppon the ſame God, our

Lord Ieſus Chriſt, appearing likewiſe in
tongues of fire vppon the Apoſtles. Who
alſoe by the guift of thy grace haſt taught
all the Saints and elect of God from the
beginning, openning in like manner the
mouthes of the Prophetes, to the end
they might declare the wonderfull thinges
of thy heauenly kingdome: who together
with the Father and the Sonne art
adored and glorified of all the Saints of
God. Amongſt whome I likewiſe the ſonne
of thy hande-maide, doe with my
whole hart glorify thy name, becauſe thou
haſt enlightned me. For thou art the true
light, the light that telleth the truth, the
truth, the fire of God, and the maiſter and
directour of our ſoules, who by thy ſacred
vnction doſt teache vs all truth.
                     Thou art the Spirit of truth, without
whoſe ayde it is impoſſible to pleaſe God:
becauſe thou thy ſelfe art God of God, &
light of light, proceeding after an vnſpeakable
manner from the Father of lightes,
and from his ſonne Ieſus Chriſt our Lord,
with whom thou art glorified, and doſt
raigne together with them ſupereſſentiallie,
being conſubſtantiall, coequall and
coeternal with them in the eſſence of one
Trinitie.
                     I haue knowen thee one liuing and
true God, the Father, the Sonne and

the holy Ghoſt, three indeede in perſonnes,
but one in eſſence: whom I confeſſe,
adore, and glorifie with my whole harte
as the t
                           •
                        ue and onely God, holy, immortall,
inuiſible, immutable, inacceſſible,
vnſearcheable, one light, one ſunne, one
breade▪ one life, one good, one beginning
and one end, one creator of heauen and
earthe: by whom all thinges doe liue, are
preſerued, guided, gouerned, and reuiued,
in heauen, in earthe, and vnder the earth:
beſides whom there is noe God either is
heauen or earthe.
                     Thus o Lord God I haue knowen thee
(who knoweſt me) thus I haue knowen
thee. I haue knowen thee o my light, by
thy faithe, which thou haſt inſpired into
me, o Lord my God the light of 
                           ••
                        ineeies,
the hope of the vniuerſall worlde,
the ioy that maketh glad my young and
tender yeares, and the good that ſuſtaineth
my old age.
                     All my bones reioyce in thee (o Lord)
ſaying: O Lord who is like vnto thee)
Who is like vnto thee o Lord amongſt
the Gods? For that the handes of men
haue not made thee, but contrariwiſe, it
is thou that haſt made the handes of men.
The idolls of the Gentills are ſiluer and
golde, the workemanſhip of the handes
of men: but the maker of men is not ſuch

an one. All the Gods of the Gentiles are
diuells, but our Lord hath made the heauens;
he therefore is the true God. Let
thoſe Gods, which haue not made heauen
and earthe, periſhe, and be caſt forth
of heauen and earthe: and let heauen and
earthe prayſe that God, which hath created
heauen and earthe.

CHAPT. XXXIII.
                     WHo is like vnto thee (o Lord euen
amonge the Gods? Who (I ſay) is
like vnto thee? Thou art greate in ſancti
                        
                           •
                        ie,
terrible, and worthy to be praiſed,
doing things that deſerue to be admired.
                     Too too late haue I knowen thee (o
true light) too too late haue I knowen
thee. And the cauſe was, for that there
was a great and darke cloude before mine
eies, that delighted in vanitie, which hindred
me from beholding the ſunne of iuſtice,
and the light of all veritie. I was
wrapt in darknes, being the child of darknes,
becauſe I knewe not the light. I was
blind
                           •
                        , and loued blindnes, and walked
through one darknes into an other.
                     Who hath deliuered me from thence,

where I remained as a blinde man, ſitting
in darknes, and in the ſhadowe of death?
Who hath taken me by the hande, and
lead me forthe of the ſame? Who is he,
that hath thus enlightned me? I ſought
him not, and he ſought me; I called him
not, and he called me. But who is he?
Thou art he (o Lord my God) being moſt
mercifull and pittifull, yea the Father of
mercies, and God of all comforte.
                     Thou (o Lord my God moſt holy) art he
that haſt donne the ſame, whom I confeſſe
with my whole harte, rendring thanks to
thy holy name. I did not ſeeke thee, thou
haſt ſought me. I did not call vpon thee,
thou haſt called me, yea thou haſt called
me by thine owne name.
                     Thou haſt thundered from heauen with
a greate voice into the internall eare of
my harte, ſaying: Let light be made, and
light was made: whereupon that greate
and darke cloude, which had couered
mine eies, departed and was diſſolued,
whereby I haue ſeene thy light, and
knowen thy voice: And I ſaied▪ Trulieo
Lord, thou art my God, who haſt deliuered
me out of darknes, and from the ſhadowe
of deathe, calling me into thy admirable
light, ſoe that now I ſee.
                     Thanks be to thee (o Lord) who haſt
enlightned me. And I looked backe, and

beheld the darknes, wherein I had liued,
and the deepe darke dongeon, wherein
I had remained, which made me with
feare and trembling to crie out, ſaying:
Woe is me, woe is me, in reſpect of the
darknes in which I haue remained; woe
is me, in reſpect of my former blindnes,
in which I could not ſee the light of heauen.
Woe is me, woe is me, in reſpect of
my former ignorance, when I did not
knowe thee o Lord. Thanks therfore be
to thee o my enlightner and deliuerer, for
that thou haſt enlightned me, and I haue
knowen thee.
                     Too too late haue I knowen thee, o ancient
veritie, too too late haue I knowen
thee, o eternall truth. Thou remained
                           •
                        s;t in
light, and I in darknes; and I knewe thee
not, becauſe I coulde not be enlightned
without thee, for that there is noe light
beſides thee.
                  
                  
                     A conſideration of Gods diuine Maieſtie.
CHAPT. XXXIV.
                     O God the holy of holies, the God of
Gods, and Lord of Lords, of ineſtimable
Maieſtie, whoſe wonderfull greatnes
cannot be vttered or imagined: before

whom the Angelicall Powers doe ſhake
for feate, whom all the Dominations, and
Thrones doe adore, in whoſe preſence all
the Vertues doe tremble, whoſe power
and wiſedome is infinite: who haſt layed
the foundation of the worlde vpon nothing,
and gathered together the ſea in
the aire as it were in a bottle.
                     O moſt mighty, moſt holy, and moſt
powerfull God, the God of the Spirits of
ſoules of all mortal creatures, from whoſe
ſight heauen and earthe doe flie away for
feare, to whom all the elements doe obey
at a becke, lett all thy creatures adore and
glorifie thee. Amongſt whom I vnworthy
wretch the ſonne of thy hand maide doe
bowe downe the necke of my harte vnder
the feete of thy ſupreame Maieſtie
(being taught ſoe to doe by the faithe,
which thou haſt giuē me) rendring thanks
vnto thee, for that thou haſt vouchſafed
by thy mercy to enlighten me.
                     O light moſt true, ſacred and delightfull,
moſt worthy of praiſe, and moſt admirable,
which enlightneth euery man
comming into this worlde, yet the eies
of the Angells themſelues. Beholde
now I ſee, for which I thanke thee. Beholde
now I ſee thee light of heauen; a
heauenly bright beame proceeding from
the face of thy brightnes, doth ſhine vpō
                        
the eies of my minde, which maketh all
my bones to reioyce.
                     O that this light were perfect in me,
encreaſe it in me, o author of light, I beſeech
thee Encreaſe (I ſay) I beſeech thee,
that light that ſhineth in me. Let it be
augmented I beſeeche thee, let it be
augmented by thee. What is this, that
I feele? What fire is this, that maketh
ho
                           •
                        te my harte? What light is this that
enlightneth my harte?
                     O fire which doſt alwaies burne, and
ar
                           •
                         neuer extinguiſhed, enflamme me O
light, which doſt alwai
                           •
                        s ſhine, and art
neuer darkned, enlighten me. O that I
were made ho
                           •
                        te by thee. O ſacred fire,
how ſweetlie doſt thou heate, how ſecretlie
doſt thou ſhine, how deſiredlie
doſt thou burne? Woe be to thoſe, that
are not made hoate by thee, woe be to
thoſe, that are not enlightned by thee. O
true light enlightning al the world, whoſe
brightnes doth repleniſhe all the worlde▪
Woe be to thoſe blind eies, which doe
not ſee thee, who art the ſunne, that giueſt
light both to heauen and earth. Woe
be to thoſe dimme eies, which cannot ſee
thee. Woe be to thoſe eies, that are turned
away from ſeeing veritie. Woe be to
thoſe eies that are not turned away from
ſeeing vanitie.
                     
                        
Verily thoſe eies, that are accuſtomed
to darknes, cannot beholde the bright
beames of thy ſupreame righteouſnes,
neither doe they knowe what to thinke
of the light, whoſe dwelling is in darknes.
They ſee, loue, and approoue the darknes,
ſoe that walking from one darknes
into an other they ſtumble, and tumble
they knowe not whither. Doubtles they
are wretched, that knowe not what they
looſe, but they are more wretched, that
knowe what they looſe, who fall with
theire eies open, and deſcend aliue into
perdition.
                     O light moſt bleſſed, who canſt not be
ſene of thoſe eies, that are neuer ſoe little
defiled; Bleſſed are the cleane in harte, for
they ſhall ſee God. Cleanſe me o cleanſing
vertue, cure mine eies, to the end, that
with ſounde and cleare eies I may be able
to beholde thee, whom ſore and ſickly
eies cannot poſſibly ſee. Remoue from
mine eies (I beſeech thee o inacceſſible
beauty) the ſcales of my former blindnes,
by the beames of thy brightnes, that I
may be able ſtedfaſtly to beholde thee,
and in thy light may ſee light.
                     Beholde, o my light, now I ſee, for
which I thanke thee. Let this my light o
Lord (I beſeech thee) be encreaſed by
thee. Open mine eies, that I may ſee the

wonderfull thinges of thy lawe who, art
wonderfull in thy Saints. I giue thee
thanks o my light, for that I now ſee, albeit
obſcurely as it were in a mirrour or
looking glaſſe: but when ſhall I ſee thee
apparantlie face to face?
                     O when will that day of ioy and mirthe
arriue, in which I ſhall enter into the
place of thy tabernacle ſoe much to be admired,
euen into the houſe of God, to the
end I may ſee him face to face, that ſeethe
me, that ſoe my deſire may be accompliſhed.
                  
                  
                     Of the deſire and thirſt of the ſoule
after God.
CHAPT. XXXV.

fountaines of water (when he is
pourſued) euen ſoe my ſoule longeth after
thee o God. My ſoule hath thirſted after
thee my God the liuing fountaine;

thy face? O fountaine of life, o veine of
liuing waters, when ſhall I come to the
waters of thy ſweetnes from this deſerte,

of life, giue me to drinke. I thirſt o
Lord, I thirſt after thee the liuing God.
O when ſhall I come good Lord, and appeare
before thy face? And ſhall I then at
length indeed ſee that day, that day (I ſay)
of ioy and gladnes, that day, which our
Lord himſelfe hath made, that we might
reioyce and be glad in it?
                     O famous, and faire day, hauing neither
euening, nor Sunſetting, in which I ſhall
heare the voyce of praiſe, mirthe, and
thanks-giuinge; in which I ſhall heare
ſaied: Enter into the ioy of thy Lord.
Enter into the euerlaſting ioy, into the
houſe of thy Lord God, where there are
greate, and vnſearchable, and wonderfull
thinges, which cannot be numbred. Enter
into that ioy, which is free from heauines,

                        euill can be found. Where ther ſhalbe
whatſoeuer thou loueſt, and nothing that

which is ſweete and louely, which likewiſe
ſhall endure euerlaſtingly. Where
there ſhalbe noe foe to impugne vs, not
allurement to entice vs, but ſoueraigne
and certaine aſſurednes, aſſured quietnes,

happie euerlaſtingnes, & euerlaſting bleſſendes;

where there is the bleſſed Trinitie,
and vnitie of Trinitie, and deitie of vnity,

all ioy, beſides which there is noe
true ioy; when ſhall I enter into thee, that
I may ſee my God, that dwelleth in thee?

Woe is me, for that my abode in this
life hath been ouer longe. How long (alas)

and Sauiour Ieſus Chriſt, who will reforme
the body of our humilitie, makinge
it like to his bright and glorious
body. We expect our Lord▪ when he
will returne from the mariages, that
he may vouchſafe to admitt vs to his
mariage.
                     Come o Lord, and doe not ſtay. Come

to attaine to the kingdome of all brightnes

thee the brightnes which ſhall euer ſhine:
(not ſeeing thee then as we doe now obſcurely
as it were in a mirroure or looking
glaſſe, but apparantly face to face) then
will our deſire in thinges that are good,
be fullie contented and ſatisfied, for that
there will be noe other externall thinge
at that time that may be deſired, ſauing
thee (o Lord) the ſupreame and chiefeſt
good. Who wilt be the rewarde of the

bleſſed, the crowne or diademe of theire
beautie, and the euerlaſting ioy, which
ſhall enuiron theire heades, giuing them
peace both without and within, by meanes
of thy peace, which paſſeth all vnderſtanding.
There we ſhall ſee thee, loue
thee, and pray ſe thee.
                     We ſhall ſee light in thy light, for that
with thee is the fountaine of life, and in
thy light we ſhall ſee light. But what
light? Surely, ſurpaſſing greate light, ſpirituall
light, inccorruptible and incomprehenſible
light, infaileable and vnquencheable
light, a light vnto which noe man
can approache or attaine, light vncreated,
true, and diuine, which enlightneth the
eies of the Angells, which maketh the
youth of the Saincts for to reioyce and
be gladde, which is the light of lights,
and fountaine of life, euen thou thy ſelfe
o Lord my God. For thou art the light, in
whoſe light we ſhal ſee light; that is to ſay,
we ſhall ſee thee in thy ſelfe, in the brightnes
of thy countenance, when we ſhall beholde
thee face to face.
                     Now what other thinge is it, to beholde
thee face to face, but (according as the
Apoſtle ſayeth) to knowe thee, euen as I
am knowen, to knowe thy truthe, and
thy glorie? To knowe thy face therfore
is nothinge elſe, but to knowe the

power of the Father, the wiſedome of the
Sonne, the mercie of the holie Ghoſt, the
eſſence of the moſt highe Trinitie, being
vndiuided, and one onely. Wherfore to
beholde the face of the liuing God, is the
chiefeſt good, the ioy of the Angells, and
of all the Saincts, the recompence of eternall
life, the glorie of the bleſſed ſpirits
the euerlaſtinge gladnes, the crowne of
comelines, the rewarde of happines, the
richeſt reſt, the beautie of peace, the internall
and externall delectation, the paradiſe
of God, the celeſtiall Hieruſalem,
the happie life, the fulnes of felicitie, the
delight of eternitie, the peace of God,
which paſſeth all vnderſtanding.
                     Mans whole bliſſe therefore, and beatitude
doth conſiſt in beholding the face
of his God, to ſee him that hath made
heauen and earthe, to ſee him that hath
made him, that hath ſaued him, that hath
glorified him. He ſhall ſee him by knowing
him, he ſhall loue him by affectinge
him, he ſhall prayſe him by poſſeſſinge
him. For he ſhall be the inheritance of his
people, of his people the Saincts and bleſſed,
of his people whom he hath redeemed.
He ſhall be the poſſeſſion of theire
beatitude, he ſhall be the rewarde and recompenſe
of that, which they haue ſoe
longe expected. Euen as he promiſed,

when he ſaied; I will be thy ſurpaſſinge
great rewarde. For that it is meete, that
ſoe great a rewarde, ſhoulde be giuen by
ſoe great a Lord.
                     Truly (o Lord my God) thou art ſurpaſſing
great aboue all the Gods▪ and thy
rewarde likewiſe is ſurpaſſing great. Neither
art thou great, and thy rewarde little,
but as thou art great, ſoe in like manner
is thy recompenſe, for that betwixt thee
and it, there is noe difference.
                     Thou thy ſelfe art ſurpaſſing great indeade,
thou thy ſelfe art a rewarde ſurpaſſing
great, thou thy ſelfe art the crowner
and the crowne, the promiſſer and the
promiſe, the giuer and the guift, the rewarder
and the rewarde of eternall happines.
Thou therfore (o my God) art the
crowner and the crowne, the diademe of
my hope, which is adorned with glorie;
thou art the light that gladdeth, the light
that reneweth, the brightnes that beautifieth,
thou art my great hope, the internall
loue and delight of the bleſſed, euen he,
whom they haue ſtill ſoe much deſired.
                     Thy ſight therfore (o Lord) is our whole
rewarde, our whole recompenſe, and all
the ioy, which we expect. For this is life
euerlaſting, this (I ſay) is thy wiſedome.
This is life euerlaſting, that we know thee

                           •••
                        onely true God, & Ieſus Chriſt whom

thou haſt ſent.
                     When therefore we ſhall beholde thee
the onely God, the true God, the liuing
God, who art, omnipotent, ſimple inuiſible,
infinite, and incomprehenſible: when
likewiſe we ſhal ſee our Lord Ieſus Chriſt
thy onely begotten ſonne, being conſubſtantiall
and coeternall with thee, whom
in the vertue of the holy Ghoſt thou haſt
ſent into the worlde for our ſaluation: Finallie
when we ſhall contemplate thee,
the God which art onely holy, three in
perſonnes, and one in eſſence, beſides
whom there is noe other; then we ſhall
obtaine that which we nowe ſeeke for,
to wit eternall life, euerlaſtinge glorie,
which thou haſt prepared for thoſe that
loue thee, which thou haſt reſerued for
thoſe that feare thee, which thou wilt
beſtowe vppon thoſe that ſeeke thee, vppon
thoſe I ſay, which ſeeke thy face continuallie.
                     Wherfore o my Lord God, who haſt
faſhioned me within the wombe of my
mother (who haſt recommended me to
the protection of thy diuine power) permit
me not any more to be diſtracted frō
one thing into many, but drawe me from
externall thinges vnto my ſelfe; and from
my ſelfe vnto thee, to the end, that my
harte may alwayes ſay vnto thee. My face

hath ſought thee, thy face will I ſeeke o
Lord, thy face o Lord of all power and
fortitude, in whoſe onely ſight doth conſiſt
the whole glory, and euerlaſting beatitude
of the bleſſed. Becauſe to ſee the
face of God is life euerlaſting, and the endleſſe
glory of the Saints in heauen.
                     Let my harte therfore reioyce, that it
may feare thy name, let theire harte reioyce,
that ſeeke our Lord, but mnch more
theires, that finde him. For if it be a pleaſure
to ſeeke him, what a ioy will it be to
finde him? Wherfore I will alwaies ſeeke
thy face with affection and deuotion,
that by that meanes I may peraduenture
at length deſerue to haue the dore and
gate of righteouſnes opened vnto me,
that I may enter into the ioy of my Lord.
This is the dore of our Lord, the iuſt ſhall
euter in thereat.

CHAPT. XXXVII.
                     O You three coequall and coeternall
perſonnes, one onely true God, the
Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghoſt,
who dwelleſt in eternitie alone, in that,
light, vnto which noe man can attaine.
Who by thy power haſt layed the world

gouerne the ſame. Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord
God of hoſts. Terrible and powerfuli, iuſt
and mercifull, worthy to be admired,
prayſed and beloued. One God, three perſonnes,
one eſſence, one power, our
wiſedome, one goodnes, one onely Trinitie
voide of ſeparation. Open the dores
of thy righteouſnes vnto me (o Lord) crying
vnto thee, to the end that being entred
in, I may praiſe thee with wordes of
thankſgiuing.
                     Beholde o ſupreame houſe-holder, I
ſtande knockinge at thy dore as a poore
begger, commaunde that thy dore may be
opened vnto me, who haſt ſayed: Knock,
and it ſhalbe opened vnto you. The affections
of my groa
                           •
                        ing harte, and the crying
of my weeping eies, doe knock at thy
dore, o Father of mercies. Thou knoweſt
my deſire, and my groaning is not hidden
from thee. Hide not then thy face from
me any longer, neither doe thou forſake
me in thine anger.
                     O Father of mercies, heare the lamentable
complainte of me thy poore orphāt,
and ſtretche forth thy helping hande, that
it may drawe me out of the deepe waters,
out of the lake of miſery, and out of the
duste and dreggs of iniquitie, that I periſh
not before the eies of thy mercy, and in

preſence of thy infinite patience: but let
me eſcape vnto thee o Lord my God, that
I may beholde the riches of thy kingedome,
and alwaies ſee thy face, and ſinge
praiſes vnto thy holy name.
                     Thou o Lord, who doſt thinges worthy
of admiration, who through, the remembrance
of thee, makeſt my harte merry,
who haſt enlightned my youthe, deſpiſe
not nowe my old age, I beſeech thee: but
cauſe my bones, and gray haires to become
ioyfull and youthfull, like vnto the
bones and hoary feathers of an Eagle.

                     THE PREFACE.
                     SEing we liue amidſt a multitude
of ſnares and ginnes, we eaſily
growe colde in the loue of heauenly
thinges. Wherfore we
ſtande in neede of continuall ſuccoure
and ayde, that as often as we fall and
faile in our dutie towardes God, we
may (as men awakened) haue recourſe
to him, the ſoueraigne and ſupreame
good. For this cauſe I haue compiled
and compoſed this little worke,
not throughe any preſumptious opinion

I haue of my ſelfe but through the great
loue of my God, and the deſire I haue to
aduance his praiſe; to the end I might alwaies
haue about me ſome ſmall Manuel
of ſhorte ſentences concerning my God,
drawen out of the worthieſt wordes and
writinges of holy Fathers; by the fire of
reading whereof, I might (as often as I
growe cold) be inflamed with affection
towardes him.
                     Now therfore aſſiſt me (o my God)
whom I ſeeke, and loue, whom likewiſe
with my harte and mouthe, and with all
my force, I prayſe and adore. My ſoule
(which is wholy deuoted to thee, and inflamed
with thy loue, ſighing and ſearching
earneſtly after thee, deſiring to ſee
thee onely) taketh delight in nothing els,
but to ſpeake, heare, write, and conferre
of thee, and frequentlye to meditate of
thy glorie, to the end that the ſweete
remembrance of thee, may be ſome mitigation
amidſt ſoe many ſtormes of affliction.
                     To thee therfore I call (o moſt deſired
Lord) to thee I crie with a loude voyce,
euen with my whole harte. And when I
call vpon thee, I call vpon thee remaining
within me, for that I were meere nothing,
if thou were not in me, neither were thou
in me, vnleſſe I were in thee. Doubtles

thou art in me, becauſe thou remaineſt in
my memorie, by which I haue knowen
thee, and in which I doe finde thee, as
often as I ame mindfull of thee, and ame
delighted in thee or frō thee; from whom,
by whom, and in whom all thinges haue
their beginning conſeruation, and being.
                     
                        Of the wonderfull eſſence of God.
CHAPT. I▪
                        
                        THou (O Lord) doſt fill heauen and
earthe, carying all thinges without
burden, filling all thinges without incluſion.
Alwayes doing, alwaies reſting. Gathering
thinges together, and yet not needie.
Seeking, albeit nothing is wanting
vnto thee, louing, without being afflicted,
iealous, yet reſting aſſured. It repenteth
thee, and yet thou art not grieued▪
thou art angrie, and yet art appeaſed.
Thou doſt alter what thou haſt donne,
without altering thy determination. Thou
takeſt what thou doſt finde, hauinge neuer
loſt any thinge. Thou reioyceſt in
gaine, althoughe thou wert neuer needie:
and albeit thou wert neuer couetous, yet
thou exacteſt vſurie. Thou giueſt more
then is demaunded, to him, that thou
act not indebted; and yet to make thee

indebted, more continuallie is giuen thee
then by thee is required. And yet who is
there, that hath any thinge not thine?
Thou payeſt debtes, being indebted to
noe man, and forgiueſt debtes, thereby
looſing nothing. Who art euerie where,
and wholie euerie where. Who maieſt be
felt, but canſt not be ſeene.
                        Woe art noe where wanting, and yet
art farre diſtant from the thoughtes of
wicked men. Who art not there abſent,
wher thou art farre diſtant, becauſe where
thou art abſent by grace, thou art preſent
by reuenge. Who art euerie where preſent
& yet canſt hardly be found. Whom
we followe ſtanding ſtill, and cannot ouertake.
Who doſt containe all thinges,
fill all thinges, enuiron all thinges, ſurmounte
all thinges, & ſuſtaine all thinges.
                        Who teacheſt the harts of the faithfull
without ſounde of wordes. Who art not
extended by places, nor changed by times,
neither doſt thou come and goe. Whoſe
dwellinge is in that inacceſſible light,
which neither is, nor can be ſeene by any
mortall wight. Remaininge quiet in thy
ſelfe, thou doſt on euerie ſide enuiron the
whole worlde. Thou canſt not be cut or
cleft, becauſe thou art trulie one, nor deuided
into partes, becauſe thou doſt who▪
lie fill, beatifie aud poſſeſſe whatſoeuer is

contained in the whole worlde.
                     
                     
                        Of the vnſpeakeable knowledge of God.
CHAPT. II.
                        IF ſoe many bookes were written, as
with them euen the whole worlde
might be filled, yet thy vnſpeakeable
knowledge coulde not be vnfolded. And
for that thou art vnſpeakeable, thou canſt
not by any meane be deſcribed or defined,
either with wordes or writing, who art
the fountaine of diuine brightnes, and the
ſunne of eternall happines.
                        Thou art greate without quantitie, and
therfore infinitely greate, thou art good
without qualitie, and therfore truly and
chiefely good; neither is any one good
but thou alone, whoſe verie will is as
the deede donne, whoſe pleaſure is reputed
for power. Who haſt created all thinges
of nothing by thine onely worde, making
thē voluntarily of thine own accord.
Who haſt all creatures in thy poſſeſſion,
hauing noe neede of them, & doſt rule and
gouerne thē without either trouble or laboure,
neither is there any thinge whatſoeuer
(either in thinges aboue, or thinges
beneathe) that can diſturbe or alter, the

ſetled order of thine Empire. Who art in
all places without place, and art euerie
where preſent without ſituation, or motion.
Who art not the author of any euill,
neither art thou able to doe euill; who art
able to doe whatſoeuer thou wilt, neither
doth it repent thee after thou haſt
donne it. By whoſe onely goodnes we
are created, by whoſe iuſtice we are chaſtiſed,
by whoſe mercie we are redeemed.
Whoſe omnipotēt power doth gouerne,
rule, and repleniſh all thinges, which it
hath created.
                        Neuertheleſſe we doe not ſay, that
thou dooſt fill all thinges, as if they did
containe thee, ſeing they are rather contained
in thee: neither doe we ſay, that
thou doſt fill them all particularlie: neither
is it lawfull to thinke that euery creature,
according to the greatnes of his capacitie
doth containe thee, that is, the
greateſt more, and the leaſt leſſe, ſithence
thou art in them all, or they all in thee.
Whoſe omnipotencie comprehendeth all
thinges whatſoeuer, neither can any one
finde meanes to eſcape thy power: ſoe
that he with whom thou art not appeaſed,
will not be able to get away, when
thou art offended.
                     
                     
                        
                        Of the deſire of the ſoule thinking of God.
CHAPT. III.
                        WHerfore I inuite thee (o moſt mercifull
God) to come into my ſoule,
which thou haſt made readie to receiue
thee by meanes of thoſe holy deſires with
which thou haſt inſpired the ſame. Enter
into it I beſeeche thee, and make it fitting
for thee, that thou mayeſt poſſeſſe it,
which thou haſt created and redeemed,
that as a ſeale, I may alwayes haue thee
fixed vpon my ſoule.
                        Forſake me not (o moſt mercifull Lord,
I beſeeche thee) calling vpon thee, for that
thou haſt called me, before I called vpon
thee, and haſt ſought me, to the end, that
I thy poore ſeruaunt ſhoulde ſeeke thee,
by ſeeking ſhoulde finde thee, and being
founde ſhould loue thee, I haue ſought
thee (o Lord) and haue founde thee, and
doe deſire to loue thee. Encreaſe my deſire,
and graunt me that which I doe deſire,
for that, vnleſſe thou giue me thy
ſelfe, I thy poore ſeruaunt cannot be ſatisfied,
albeit thou ſhouldeſt giue me
whatſoeuer thou haſt created. Giue me
thy ſelfe therefore, o my God, giue me

thy ſelfe.
                        Beholde I loue thee, and if it be but a
little, I will loue thee more. Verilie (o
Lord) I doe loue thee, I doe deſire thee
exceedinglie, I am much delighted with
the ſweete remembrance of thee. For
during the time that my minde doth ſigh
after thee, whileſt it meditateth of thy
vnſpeakeable mercie, the burden of my
fleſh is leſſe burdenſome vnto me, the
hurly burly of my cares and cogitations
doe then ceaſe, the weight of my mortalitie
and manifolde miſeries doth not according
to its wonted manner dull me,
all thinges are quiet and at peace. My hart
burneth, my minde reio

flouriſheth, my vnderſtanding ſhineth,
yea my whole ſoule is as it were rauiſhed,
with the loue of thinges that are heauenlie,
being inflamed with a deſire of
ſeeing thee.
                        Let my ſoule therfore take as it were
the winges of an Eagle, and flie, and not
faile, let it flie vntill it come to the beautie
of thy houſe, and to the throne of thy
glorie, that there in the place of thy paſture
(which is enuironned with pleaſant
riuers) it may be fedd with the foode of
thine internall conſolation, ſitting at the
ſame table, on which thoſe heauenly cit

                           izens
are wonte to take their refection.

Be thou (o Lord) our ioy and exultation,
who art our hope, ſaluation, and redemption.
Be thou our mirthe and gladnes, who
art our future happines. Let my ſoule alwaies
ſeeke thee, and graunt, that it may
not fainte in ſeeking thee.
                     
                     
                        Of the miſerable eſtate of that ſoule,
that doth neither loue nor ſeeke
our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.
CHAPT. IV.
                        WOe be to that vnhappie ſoule, which
doth neither ſeeke nor loue Ieſus
Chriſt our Lord, for that it remaineth
withered and wretched. He that loueth
not thee (o God) liueth but in vaine. He
that deſireth to loue (o Lord) but not for
thee, is as it were a meere nothing, and
not worthy of any eſtimation. He that liueth
not to thee, is alreadie deade. He that
knoweth not thee, is a foole.
                        To thee therefore (o moſt mercifull
Lord) I commend and commit my ſelfe,
from whom I haue receiued my being, life
and wiſedome; In thee is my hope, truſt,
and confidence, by whome I hope to
ariſe, liue, and obtaine euerlaſtinge reſt,
and quietnes. I deſire, loue, and adore
thee, with whom I ſhall remaine, raigne,

and be happie, during all eternity. That
ſoule doubtleſſe loueth the worlde, which
doth not ſeeke and loue thee; it is a ſeruaunt
to ſinne; a ſlaue to all manner of
iniquitie, being neuer at reſt, neuer in ſecuritie.
                        Graunt (o ſweete Sauiour) that my ſoule
may alwaies ſerue thee. Let my pilgrimage
heere vppon earthe continually ſigh
after thee, let my harte be enflamed with
the loue of thee. Let my ſoule (o my God)
repoſe in thee, let it contemplate thee in
exceſſe of minde, let it with ioyfullnes
ſinge and ſounde forthe thy prayſes, and
let this be my comforte during the time
of this my baniſhment.
                        Let my minde flie vnder the ſhadow of
thy winges, from the heate of worldly cogitations.
Let my harte pauſe and repoſe
in thee, my harte (I ſay) which is like vnto
a ſpatious and tempeſtuous ſea.
                        O God the moſt riche and bountifull
giuer of the diuine daintie diſhes of heauenlie
plentie, refreſhe it being wearie,
recall it being gone aſtray, deliuer it being
in captiuitie, and being by ſinne as it were
broken in peeces, reſtore it to the eſtate
of its former innocencie.
                        Beholde it ſtandeth at thy dore, knocking
and calling vnto thee. I beſeech thee
(o Lord) by the bowells of thy mercy,

in which thou haſt viſited vs comminge
downe from heauen, commaund thy gate
to be opened vnto my poore wretched
ſoule, knocking at the ſame, to the end it
may freelie enter in, and repoſe in thee,
and be fed by thee the breade of heauen:
for thou art the breade and fountaine of
life, thou art the light of euerlaſting felicitie;
thou art all thinges, by which the
righteous doe liue, that loue thee.
                     
                     
                        Of the deſire of the ſoule.
CHAPT. V.
                        O God the light of thoſe harts that ſee
thee, the life of thoſe ſoules that
loue thee, & the ſtrength of thoſe thoughtes
that ſeeke thee, graunt me grace, that
by loue I may alwaies▪ adhere vnto thee.
Come I beſeech thee into my harte, and
make it drunke with the plentie of thy
pleaſure, to the end, I may forget all temporall
thinges whatſoeuer.
                        Verilie I am aſhamed and grieued to
endure ſuch thinges as are donne in the
worlde▪ Whatſoeuer I ſee in this vale of
miſerie is diſpleaſing vnto me, whatſoeuer
I heare of thinges tranſitorie, is burdenſome
vnto me. Helpe me (o Lord my God)
and make my harte glad, come vnto me,

that I may ſee thee.
                        But (alas) the houſe of my ſoule is ouer
little to entertaine thee, vntill thou enter
into it and enlarge it: It is ruinous and
ready to fall, wherfore I beſeech thee to
repaire it. It hath many thinges (I confeſſe
and knowe) contained in it, which
are diſpleaſing in thy ſight, but who will
cleanſe it, or to whom beſides thee, ſhall
I crie to doe it? Cleanſe me (o Lord) from
my ſecret ſinnes, and be mercifull vnto
thy ſeruaunt in reſpect of other mens ſinnes
committed by my meanes.
                        Graunt me grace (o ſweete Chriſt, o
good Ieſu) graunt me grace I beſeech thee,
to lay aſide the burden of all carnall loue,
and worldly deſires through the loue and
deſire of thee. Let my ſoule haue dominion
ouer my body, reaſon ouer my ſoule,
thy grace ouer reaſon, and make me in
all thinges ſubiect to thy moſt holy will
both without and within.
                        Afforde me this fauoure I beſeech thee,
that my harte, and tongue, and all my bones
may praiſe and magnifie thee. Dilate
my mind, and lift vp the eies of my harte,
that (albeit for neuer ſoe ſhorte a time)
my ſoule may attaine vnto thee the eternall
wiſedome, abiding aboue all thinges.
Free me (I beſeech thee) from the bandes,
with which I am bounde, that forſaking

all thinges tranſitorie, I may adhere and
attende vnto thee onely.
                     
                     
                        Of the ſoules felicitie, being deliuered
out of the priſon of this earthly
body.
CHAPT. VI.
                        HAppy is that ſoule, which beinge
freed from this earthlie priſon, doth
freely mounte vp into heauen, which beholdeth
thee (o ſweete Lord) apparantlie
face to face, being now noe more affraied
of deathe or of any worldlie miſerie, but
reioycinge throughe the immortalitie of
euerlaſting glory. It liueth in repoſe and
ſecuritie, fearing now neither deathe no
                              •
                           
ennimie. It enioyeth thee being a mercifull
Lord, whom it hath long ſought, and
alwaies loued, and being ioyned in felowſhip
with the quires of Angells, it ſingeth
for euer mellifluous ſonnets of perpetuall
gladnes, in praiſe and commendation of
thy glory, o Chriſt our King, o good Ieſu.
Verilie it becommeth as it were drunke
throughe the aboundance of thy heauenlie
habitation, becauſe thou doſt cauſe it to
drinke of the riuer of thy vnſpeakeable
delectation.
                        O howe happy is the heauenlie company

of celeſtiall cittizens, how glorious
is the ſolemni
                              •
                           ie of all thoſe that returne
vnto thee (o Lord) from the toiles and
trauailes of this our pilgrimage, to the
pleaſantnes of all beauty, to the beauty
of all brightnes, and to the dignitie of all
excellencie, where thy cittizens, o Lord
doe continuallie ſee thee? Nothing at all
is there hearde, that may moleſt the minde;
What ſacred Canticles? what diuerſitie
of inſtruments? what delightfull ditties?
what ſweete ſounds of heauenlie
harmonie are there hearde inceſſantlie?
There the mellifluous organ, there the
moſt ſweete melodie of Angels, doe
ſounde forth Hymnes, and admirable
Canticles of Canticles euelaſtingly, which
are ſonge by the celeſtiall cittizens to thy
praiſe and glory.
                        Noe ſpitefulnes or bitternes of affection,
is founde in that heauenly region;
for that neither malice nor malitious
men, haue there any abiding. Noe aduerſarie
is there to impugne vs, nor occaſion
of ſinne to entice vs. There is noe want
or pouertie in that place, noe ſhame or
disgrace, noe brawling, noe vp braiding,
noe blaming, noe fearefullnes, noe diſquietnes,
noe paine, noe doubtfullnes,
noe violence, noe variance: but contrariwiſe
ſurpaſſing greate peace, perfect charitie,

ſinging and praiſing of God euerlaſtinglie,
perpetuall repoſe ioined with ſecuritie,
and ioy in the holy Ghoſt during
all eternitie.
                        O how fortunate ſhall I be, if after this
life, I ſhalbe admitted to heare the moſt
pleaſant and ſweete ſonges of thoſe heauenlie
cittizens; if I ſhalbe admitted (I ſay)
to heare thoſe mellifluous meeters of
poetrie, made to expreſſe the praiſes, and
honoure due to the moſt ſacred Trinitie.
O how much more happy ſhall I be, then
I can imagine, if I my ſelfe likewiſe ſhalbe
thought worthy to ſing a ſonge to our
Lord Ieſus Chriſt, euen one of the ſweete
ſonges of Syon.
                     
                     
                        Of the ioy of Paradiſe.
CHAPT. VII.
                        O Liuing life, o euerlaſting life, and
euerlaſtinglie happie. Where there
is ioy without griefe, reſt without laboure▪
dignitie without feare, riches without
ſicknes, plentie without want, life
without deathe, eternitie without corruption,
felicitie without affliction: where all
good thinges are comprehended in perfect
charitie, where the Sainctes ſee God
and one an other apparantlie: where

where there is perfect knowledge in
all thinges, and of all thinges, where
the ſupreame goodnes of God is behelde,
and the light, that enlightneth all thinges
is by the Saincts glorified: where Gods
maieſtie is ſeene preſent, and with this
foode of life the minde of the beholders
doth remaine ſatisfied and content.
                        They alwaies ſee God, and by ſeeing
long to ſee him, they deſire it without
loathſomnes: where the true ſunne of iuſtice
doth refreſhe them all, by the wonderfull
light of his vnſpeakeable beautie,
and doth in that manner enlighten all the

                           ttizens of that celeſtiall countrie, as that
they (beinge but a light enlightned by
God, who is the light that enlightneth
them) doe ſhine more bright then the
ſunne, and all the ſtars of heauen. Who
adhering vnto God, who is immortall, are
by this meanes made immortal and incorruptible,
accordinge as our Lord and Sauiour
hath promiſed, ſaying. O Father my
will and deſire is., that thoſe which thou
haſt giuen me, may be preſent with me
where I am, to the end they may ſee my
glorie, that all may be one, that as thou o
Father art in me, and I in thee, euen ſoe
they may be one in vs.
                     
                     
                        
                        Of the kingdome of heauen.
CHAPT. VIII.
                        THe kingedome of heauen is a moſt
happy kingdome, free from death,
voide of end, where time without ſucceſſion
of ages is ſtill the ſame, where one
continuall day without interchaunge of
night, knoweth neither time paſt, nor to
come, where the valiant ſouldier after
many trauailes ſuſtained, and victorie obtained,
is, with vnſpeakeable guifts rewarded,
a crowne of endles bliſſe being ſet
vpon his heade.
                        O would to God (the multitude of my
ſinnes being forgiuen me) it might pleaſe
his diuine bounty to bidd me (of al Chriſts
ſeruants the moſt vnworthie) to lay aſide
the burden of this my incorruptible body,
to the end I might enter into the endles
ioyes of his heauenly citty, there to finde
reſt for all eternitie, that I might be placed
to ſinge amongſt the moſt ſacred quires of
thoſe celeſtiall citizens, that with thoſe
moſt bleſſed ſpirits I might helpe to ſound
forthe the praiſes of my maker, and might
in preſence beholde the face of my God
and Sauiour, that I might be exemp
                              •
                           
from all feare of deathe and worldly miſerie,

and might ſecurelie reioyce through
the incorruption of perpetuall immortalitie,
that I might be free from all blindnes
of ignorance, being vnited vnto him
that knoweth all thinges.
                        I ſhould little eſteeme all thinges tranſitorie,
and ſhoulde ſcarce vouchſafe to
caſt mine eie, or to thinke vpon this vale
of teares any more, where our life is ſubiect
to affliction, ſubiect to corruption,
where our life is repleniſhed with al manner
of bitternes, being the miſtres of miſcreants,
and handmaide vnto hell it ſelfe:
whom humors puffe vp, whom paines
pull downe, whom heates doe pearche,
whom the ayre maketh ſicke, whom feaſting
maketh fatt, and faſtinge maketh
leane, whom delightes make diſſolute,
whom ſorrowes doe conſume, whom
penſiuenes doth oppreſſe, whom ſecurity
maketh dull, whom riches lift vp, and
make ſtately, whom pouertie doth abaſe
and make lowly, whom youth maketh to
be magnified, olde age to be crooked,
whom ſicknes weakeneth, and ſadnes afflicteth.
Where the diuell lieth in waite
to deceiue vs, the worlde flattereth vs;
where the fleſhe is delighted, the ſoule is
blinded, and man on euery ſide is troubled
and diſquieted. And cloſe as it were
at the heeles of all theſe euills, doth furious

deathe come after, cloſinge vp the
end of the delightes of this miſerable life
in that faſhion, as that being ended, they
are as if they had neuer beene begunne.
                     
                     
                        How God viſiteth and comforteth that
ſoule, which with ſighes and teares
lamenteth his abſence.
CHAP. IX.
                        Bvt what praiſes or thankſ-giuing are
we able (o God) to rendre vnto thee,
who ceaſeſt not to comfort vs with the
wonderfull viſitation of thy grace, euen
amidſt the manifold miſeries of this our
mortalitie? For beholde, whiles I feare
what my end will be, whiles I enter into
conſideration of my ſinnes and iniquities,
whiles I am affrayed of thy iudgements,
whiles I thinke of the hower of my death,
whiles I ſhiuer and ſhake throughe the
horrour of hell, being ignorant how ſtrictlie
and ſeuerely my actions wilbe examined
by thee, as alſoe not knowing what
the end of them wilbe.
                        Whiles with my ſelfe (I ſay) I conſider
ſecretly in my harte theſe and many other
ſuch like thinges, thou (o Lord my God)
accordinge to thy wonted goodnes, doſt

come, and comforte me poore wretche,
beinge wholy ouerwhelmed with heauines,
lifting vp my ſad and ſorrowfull ſoule
(amidſt my manifolde wailinges and
weepinges, and profound ſighes and lamentations)
aboue the highe toppes of
the hilles euen vnto the bedds of ſweete
and fiagrant ſpices, placing me in a place
of paſture, neere vnto the little brookes
of ſweete and pleaſant waters, preparing
there in my preſence a ſumptuous banquet
abounding with all varieties, which
may refreſh my wearied ſpirit, and make
glad my ſorrowfull harte At length being
made ſtronge againe by theſe dainties and
delicacies, I growe to forget my manifold
miſeries, for that I repoſe in thee the true
peace, being eleuated aboue all earthlie
highnes.
                     
                     
                        Of the ſweetnes of diuine loue.
CHAPT. X.

God, who in beauty doſt ſurpaſſe the children
of men, that I may deſire and loue
thee according to the greatnes of mine affection,
and according to the greatnes of

mine obligatiō. Thou art infinite (o Lord)
and therfore art infinitely to be loued, eſpeciallie
of vs, whom thou haſt ſoe wonderfullie
reſpected, and ſaued, for whom
thou haſt donne ſoe great thinges, and
ſuch as are worthie to be admired.
                        O loue, which doſt alwaies burne, and

loue of thee, with thy ſweetnes, with the
delight, and deſire of thee, with thy charitie,
with thy mirthe, and gladnes, with
thy mercy and gentlenes, with thy pleaſure
and affection, which is holy & good,
chaſt and cleane: to the end, that beinge
wholy repleniſhed with the ſweetnes of
thy loue, being wholy made hotte with
the flame of thy charitie, I may loue the

moſt ſacred ſheddinge of thy pretious

that wonderfull and celeſtiall ſacrifice and
oblation worthy of all reuerence and deuotion;
which thou o Lord my God the
immaculate Prieſt, haſt inſtituted and appointed
to be offered in remembrance of
thy charitie, that is, of the deathe and paſſion,
which thou haſt ſuffered for our deliuerie,

which doſt alwaies burne, o ſweete Chriſt,
o good Ieſu, the eternall, and neuer failing
light, the breade of life, who doſt feede
vs, with thy ſelfe, without hurte to thy

whole without being broken.
                        I beſeeche thee (o Lord) to ſhine vppon
me, and to enflame me: Enlighten and ſanctifie
me thy veſſell, cleanſe me from malice,
fill me, and preſerue me full of thy
grace, that to the good of my ſoule, I may
eate the foode of thy fleſhe, to the end,
that by eating thee, I may liue of thee, I
may liue by thee, I may come to thee, and
repoſe in thee.

CHAPT. XII.
                        O Lord the ſweetnes of loue, and the
loue of ſweetnes: Be thou my foode,
and let all my bowelles be filled with the
delitious drinke of thy loue; to the end,
that all my wordes and cogitations may
be good, and tending to edification. Make
me (o Lord and my loue) to encreaſe in
thee, that thou mayeſt be eaten by me
worthily, who art more ſweete then honie,
more white then ſnowe, the foode of

                        Thou art my life, by which I liue, my
hope, to which I adhere, my glory, which

thirſting after thee, to the waters of life
euerlaſting.
                        Let all tumultuous thoughtes and carnall
cogitations (I beſeeche thee) holde
theire peace: Let all phantaſies of the
earth and waters, of the ayre and heauens
keepe ſilence. Let all dreames, and imaginarie
reuelations, all tongues and tokens,
keepe ſilence; briefly, let all thinges holde
theire peace that are donne in this vale of
miſerie, being all of them ſhort, and ſoone
paſſing away.
                        Let my ſoule in like ſorte be ſilent, and
not ſpeake a worde, let it leaue it ſelfe, by
not thinking of it ſelfe, but of thee (o my
God) for that thou art my true and onely
hope, and my whole confidence. Becauſe
a parte of each one of vs, as the blood, and
fleſh, is founde in thee, o Lord our God, in
thee (I ſay) o moſt ſweete, moſt gratious,
and moſt milde Ieſu. Where therfore
parte of me doth raigne, there I belieue
likewiſe to haue dominion, and where
my blood doth dominere, there I truſt to

haue principalitie and power. Where my
fleſhe is glorified, there I knowe my ſelfe
to be renowned.
                        Although I am a ſinner, yet I doe not
deſpaire to be pertaker of this grace and
fauoure: although my ſinnes doe hinder
it, yet my ſubſtance doth require it. Although
my faultes and defectes doe exclude
me, yet my humaine nature which
is common to me with Chriſt, doth not
repell me.
                     
                     
                        That the Worde incarnate, is the
cauſe of our hope.
CHAPT. XIII.
                        DOubtles God is not ſoe cruell, as
not to loue his owne fleſhe, members,
and bowells. I ſhould certainely deſpaire
by reaſon of the manifolde ſinnes,
and vices, faultes and negligences, which
I haue committed, and doe dailie, and
continuallie, commit in thought, worde
and deede, and by all manner of meanes
by which humaine frailtie is able to offend,
were it not that thy diuine Worde
(o my God) had beene made fleſhe, and
dwelt in vs. But now I dare not deſpaire,
becauſe he being obedient vnto thee vntil
deathe, euen the deathe of the Croſſe,

hath taken our handewrittinge or obligation
(wherein we ſtoode bounde as ſlaues
to the Diuell by ſinne) and faſtning it
to the Croſſe, hath crucified both ſin and
deathe. In him I ſecurely breathe, who ſitteth
at thy right hande, and maketh interceſſion
for vs.
                        Truſting therefore in his bountie, I deſire
to come to thee, in whom we are already
riſen againe from the deade, and are
reuiued; with whom we haue alreadie aſcended
into heauen, and ſit with him in
glorie in that happie region. To thee therfore
(o heauenly Father) be all praiſe, glory,
honor, and thanks-giuinge.
                     
                     
                        HOw the more we are addicted to diuine
contemplation, the greater delight
we take therein.
CHAT. XIV.
                        How ſweete is the remembrance of
thee vnto vs, (o moſt louing Lord)
who haſt ſoe dearelie loued and ſaued vs,
who haſt ſoe wonderfullie reuiued and
exalted vs. The more I meditare of thee,
(o moſt mercifull Lord) the more ſweete
and amiable thou art vnto me. And for
that thy goodnes doth exceedinglie delight
me; I purpoſe as long as I liue in the

place of this pilgrimage, to deſire and contemplate
without ceaſing thy wonderfull
loue & vnſpeakeable beautie, with apure
intention, and with a moſt ſweete and louinge
affection. Becauſe I am wounded
with the darte of thy charitie, I am wonderfullie
enflamed with the deſire of thee,
coue
                              •
                           ing to come to thee, to ſee thee.
                        Wherfore I will ſtande vppon my
guarde, and will ſinge in ſpirit with watchfull
eies▪ yea I wil ſinge with my minde,
and with all my forces: I will praiſe thee
my creator and redeemer, I will pe
                              •
                           rce
the heauens by deuotion and feruoure,
and will remaine with thee by a feruent
deſire: that being detained in this preſent
miſerie with my bodie only, I may in
thought and affection be continuallie with
thee, to the end my hart may be there,
where thou art, my deſired, incomparable,
and moſt beloued treaſure.
                        But alas (o Lord) my hart is not ſufficient
to contēplate the glorie of thy great
goodnes and pittie, for that thou art a
God of infinite meekenes and mercie: verily
thy praiſe, thy beautie, thy vertue, thy
glorie, thy magnificence, thy maieſtie, and
thy charitie, doth farre ſurpaſſe the capacitie
of any mortall memorie. For euen as
the brightnes of thy glorie is ineſtimable,
ſoe likewiſe the largenes of thy charitie is

vnſpeakeable, whereby thou doſt adopt
thoſe to be thy children, and vnite them
vnto thee by loue and affection, whom
thou haſt created of nothinge.
                     
                     
                        How for Christs ſake we ought to
wishe for tribulations in
this life.
CHAT. XV.
                        O My ſoule, if it were neceſſary daylie
to ſuffer torments, yea to endure
hell it ſelfe for a longe time together, that
we might ſee Chriſt in 
                              〈◊〉

ioyned in felowſhip with the Saintes in
his heauenly cittie, were it not meete
(thinkeſt thou) to ſuſtaine all manner of
miſerie, that we might be made pertakes
of ſoe greate a good, and of ſoe greate
felicitie?
                        Let the diuells therfore endeuoure (as
much as they will) to entrap me, and by
tentatious to deceiue me, let longe faſtinge
weaken my bodie, and courſe cloathing
ſubdue my fleſhe, let trauaile trouble
me, and watching drie me vp to nothinge,
let others exclaime againſt me, let
this or that man diſquiet and moleſt me,
let colde make me crooked, let my conſcience
murmure againſt me, let heate

ſcorche me, let my bodie be grieued, my
breaſt enflamed, my ſtomacke puffed vp
with winde, my countenance wanne and
withered: let me be wholie afflicted with
ſicknes, let my life conſume away in ſadnes,
and my yeares in ſighes and ſorrowfullnes,
let rottennes enter into my bones,
and flowe as water out of my fleſhe,
to the end I may finde reſt in the day of
aduerſitie, and aſcende to thoſe celeſtiall
ſouldiers, that haue obtained the victorie.
                        O how greate wilbe the glorie and ioy
of the iuſt and Saincts in heauen, ſithence
the face of eache one of them ſhall ſhine
as bright as the ſunne? at ſuch time as our
Lord ſhall beginne to number his choſen
people in the kingdome of his Father,
eache one diſtinctly in his order, and ſhall
render to euerie one the rewardes which
he promiſed, according as by theyr actions
in this life they haue deſerued: for 
                              •
                           arthly
thinges giuing thē celeſtiall, for tranſitory
eternall, for ſmall and little, moſt ample
and immeaſurable.
                        There ſhalbe without all doubt ſtore of
happineſſe and felicitie, when our Lord
ſhall leade his Saincts to the ſight of his
Fathers glorie, making the to ſit on ſeates
celeſtiall, to the end that God may be all
in all.
                     
                     
                        
                        By what meanes the kingdome of heauen
may be purchaſed and gotten.
CHAPT. XVI.
                        O Happie ioy, and ioyfull happines,
to ſee the Saincts, to be with the
Saincts, and to be a Sainct, to ſee and enioy
God worlde without end, and longer
to, if longer coulde be imagined. Let vs
carefullie conſider theſe thinges, and feruently
deſire them, to the end, we may
ſpeedilie be ioyned to the company of the
Saincts in heauen.
                        If thou demaunde how this may be
donne, by what merits or ſuccoure, hearken,
and thou ſhalt heare. This thinge
lieth in the power of the doer, becauſe
the kingdome of heauen ſuffereth violence.
The kingdome of heauen (o man)
asketh noe other price but thy ſelfe, it is
aſmuch worthe as thou art Giue thy ſelfe
therfore, and thou ſhalt haue it. Whie art
thou troubled and diſcontent at the price?
Chriſt gaue himſelfe, that he might purchaſe
thee, as a kingdome vnto God the
Father. Giue thou thy ſelfe in the ſame
manner, to the end thou mightſt be his
kingdome, and let not ſinne raigne in
this thy bodie, which is ſubiect to

corruption; but rather let the ſpirit gouerne,
for the attaining of life euerlaſtinge.
                     
                     
                        What heauen is, and what happines
is contained therein.
CHAPT. XVII.
                        LEt vs returne (o my ſoule) to the heauenlie
cittie, in which we are written
and enrolled as cittizens of the ſame.
Let vs (as cittizens of the ſainctes and
Gods houſe-holde ſeruants, yea as Gods
heires and coheires of Chriſt) conſider the
felicitie of this our famous cittie, to the
vttermoſt of our poſſibilitie: Let vs crie
out with the Prophet; O how glorious
things are ſaied of thee, o Cittie of God,
in thee is the dwellinge of all thoſe, that
are trulie glad. Becauſe thou art built as
a place to meete and make merrie, for
ſuche as God of his infinitie mercie, dot
                              ••
                           
vouchſafe to take vnto himſelfe out of
this vale of miſerie.
                        In thee there is noe old age, nor miſerie
enſuing of the ſame, in thee there is
noe one lame or mamed, crumpe ſhouldered,
or deformed: ſeing all concurre into
a perfect man, into the meaſure of the age
of the fulnes of Chriſt.
                        
                           
What can be imagined more happie
then this life, where there is noe feare of
pouertie, nor feeblenes of infirmitie,
where noe man is wronged, noe man is
diſpleaſed, noe mā doth enuie at an others
good. Where there is noe greedines of
gaine, noe appetite of eating or drinking;
where there is noe inordinate deſire of
honoure or ambition, noe dreade of diuel,
or of diuelliſhe temptation, noe horroure
of hell or of helliſhe damnation. Where
there is noe deathe either of bodie or
ſoule, but a delightfull life, endles and
immortall.
                        Noe euill affections or diſſentiōs ſhalbe
founde there, but all thinges ſhall accorde
and agree together, becauſe all the Saincts
of that heauenly region, ſhalbe of one
minde and affection. Where there is nothing
but peace and gladnes, repoſe and
quietnes. Where there is perpetual brightnes,
not that which now is, but by ſoe
much more bright, by how much more
bleſſed; becauſe that cittie (euen as it is
written) ſhall neede neither ſunne nor
moone, but God almighty ſhall enlighten
the ſame, and the lampe thereof is the
lambe. Where the Saincts ſhall ſhine as
the ſtarrs for all eternitie, and thoſe that
teache many, ſhall in brightnes reſemble
the clearenes of the skie.
                        
                           
Wherfore in that place there ſhalbe
noe night, noe darknes, noe concourſe of
cloudes, noe auſteritie of colde or heate,
but that temperature of all thinges, which
neither eie hath ſeene, nor eare hath
hearde, neither hath it entred into the
harte of any man, ſauing of thoſe, who are
founde worthy to enioy the ſame, whoſe
names are written in the booke of life.
                        But a greater content then this will be,
to be ioyned in felowſhip with the quires
of Angells, and Archangells, and of all
the heauenlie vertues, to beholde the Patriarches
and Prophets, to ſee the Apoſtles,
and all the other Saincts, and amōge
the reſt, our parents, kinsfolke, and acquaintance.
                        Theſe thinges without doubte are very
glorious; but yet it is more glorious to
beholde the face of God there preſent, and
the brightnes proceeding from the ſame,
which is infinitely greate. Finally to ſee
God in himſelfe, to ſee him & enioy him
in our ſelues wilbe a prerogatiue of glory
ſurpaſſing all the reſt in excellēcy, becauſe
we ſhall ſee him euerlaſtingly.
                     
                     
                        
                        How man can make noe other requitall
vnto God for the benefits receiued
from him, but onely by louinge
him.
CHAP. XVIII.
                        THe ſoule of man (being famous and
renowned by being created according
to the image and likenes of God)
hath in it ſelfe meanes from God, by
which it is alwaies admoniſhed either to
remaine with him, or to returne vnto him,
if at any time by ſinnefull affections or
defects it be ſperated from him. Neither
hath it meanes onely, by which it may
be able to deſire and hope for mercie and
pardon (when it hath offended) but likewiſe
by which it may preſume to aſpire to
the mariage of the diuine Worde, yea to
enter into a league of friendſhip with
God almighty, and with the kinge of Angells
to drawe the ſweete yoke of charity.
                        Loue cauſeth all this, if by the will the
ſoule make it ſelfe like vnto God, to whō
by nature it is alreadie likened, that is by
louing him like as it beloued. For it is
loue aloue of all the motions, ſenſes, and
affections of the ſoule, in which a creature

may be anſwearable and make requitall
to his creator, althoughe in a farre inferior
degree and meaſure.
                        Where loue doth arriue, it carrieth
away with it all the other affections, and
as a conqueroure maketh them captiue.
Loue is ſufficient of it ſelfe, it is pleaſing
of it ſelfe and for it ſelfe. It is the merit,
the rewarde, the cauſe, the fruite and the
helpe of it ſelfe, for by loue we are vnited
to God. Loue cauſeth two ſpirits to become
one, making the ſame will, and the
ſame nill in both of them. Loue teacheth
vs firſt of all how to behaue our ſelues, ſecondly
to eſteeme of all thinges preſent,
as if they were not, thirdlie to contemplate
celeſtiall and internall thinges, with
a pure and cleane harte. By loue firſt of all
honeſt thinges are laudably donne in the
worlde, afterwardes the honeſt thinges
of the worlde growe to be contemned,
and laſtly the very ſecrets of God are by
it ſeene and conſidered.
                     
                     
                        How God requireth ſomething in vs
like vnto himſelfe.
CHAPT. XIX.
                        GOd the Father is charity, ſoe is God
the Sōne, the holy Ghoſt is the loue

that proceedeth from both of them. This
charity and loue requireth ſomething in
vs like vnto it, to witt charity, by which
we may be ioyned and vnited vnto God,
as it were by affinitie of blood. Loue maketh
noe difference of perſonnes, neither
doth it know how to behaue it ſelfe with
reuerence.
                        He that loueth, goeth boldlie vnto God
of himſelfe alone, and talketh familiarlie
with him, fearing and doubting nothing.
He that loueth not, liueth but in vaine.
But he that loueth hath his eies alwaies
fixed on God, whom he loueth whom he
deſireth, on whom he thinketh, in whom
he is delighted, by whom he is fedd; and
refreſhed. Such a man, that is endewed
with ſuch deuotion, doth ſoe ſinge and
reade, and in all his actions doth carry
himſelfe with that care and circumſpection,
as if God were preſent before his
eies, as indeede he is. He prayeth with
that feruoure and deuotion, as if he were
aſſumpted vp into heauen, and preſented
before the Maieſtie of God that ſitteth on
his throne, where thouſandes, of thouſandes
doe ſerue him, and ten hundred
thouſande, doe attende vpon him.
                        Loue cauſeth the ſoule which it viſiteth,
throughe loue to awaken when it ſleepeth.
It admoniſheth and mollifieth

it, wounding it as it were to the very
harte. Loue enlightneth thoſe thinges
that are darke, it openeth thoſe that
are ſhut, the thinges that are colde it
maketh hotte, it mitigateth the minde,
that is frowarde, angry, and impatient,
it chaſeth away vice and iniquitie, it
repreſſeth all deſire of carnalitie, it amendeth
our manners and bad cuſtomes,
and reformeth the ſpiritt, making
it to change its faſhions. Finallie it
bridleth the motions of our youthe, and
our light actions.
                        All this doth loue, when it is preſent:
but aſſoone as it depatteth, the ſoule beginneth
forthwith in that manner to become
fainte and feeble, euen as if you
ſhould wri
                              •
                           hdrawe the fire from a boyling
cauldron or kettle.
                     
                     
                        Of the greate confidence which the
ſoule hath, that loueth
God.
CHAP. XX.
                        Loue without doubte is a greater
thinge then can be well expreſſed, by
which the ſoule goeth boldlie vnto God
of it ſelfe alone, and adhereth conſtantlie
vnto him: it queſſioneth and conſulteth

with him vpon euery occaſion. The ſoule
that loueth God; can thinke or ſpeake of
nothing els beſide, becauſe it doth contemne,
and in a manner abhorre all other
thinges whatſoeuer. The loue of God
doth change it into himſelfe in that wonderful
faſhion, as that whatſoeuer it thinketh
or ſpeaketh of, doth as it were taſt
and ſmell of affection.
                        He therfore that deſireth to attaine to
the knowledge of God, let him loue. In
vaine he attempteth to reade or meditate,
to preache or pray, that loueth not. The
loue of God begetteth the loue of the ſoule.,
and maketh it to attend to it ſelfe,
God loueth vs to noe other end, but that
we ſhould loue him againe. When he
loueth. he deſireth nothing els, but to be
beloued. knowing, that thoſe that loue
him, are by loue made bleſſed.
                        The ſoule that loueth, addicteth it ſelfe
wholy to the loue of God (all proper affections
being layed aſide) to the end, that
by louing him againe, it may make ſome
requital for the loue receiued from him.
And yet, when it hath powred forth it
ſelfe wholy in affection, what is it, in reſpect
of the fountaine of loue, frō whence
it had his beginning.
                        True it is that noe true compariſon can
be made betweene the louer and the beloued,

betweene the ſoule and God, betweene
the Creator and the thing created;
and yet if it loue God to the vttermoſt of
its power, there remaineth nothing, that
it can doe more. Let not that ſoule which
loueth, be affraied, let that ſoule feare that
loueth not God. The ſoule that loueth, is
led with promiſes, drawen with deſires,
it keepeth ſecret its owne merits, it ſhutteth
the eies to all worldlie honoure, and
openeth them to the diuine pleaſure, relying
wholie in Chriſts protection, and
doing all things with a confidence in him.
                        Through loue, the ſoule leaueth and
eſtrangeth it ſelfe from the corporall ſenſes,
to the end, that feeling God, it may
not feele it ſelfe. This hapneth, when
the ſoule (being allured throughe Gods
vnſpeakeable ſweetnes) doth as it were
ſt
                              •
                           ale it ſelfe from it ſelfe, or rather is caried,
and ſlideth away from it ſelfe, to
the end it may enioy God with much
gladnes. Neither is there any thinge ſoe
ſweete, were it not ſoe ſhorte.
                        Loue maketh vs familiar with God, familiaritie
cauſeth blodnes. blodnes taſte,
and taſte hunger The ſoule which is touched
with the loue of God, is able to
thinke, or deſire noe other thinge, but
crieth out inceſſantlie with ſighes, ſaying:
Euen as the harte or ſtagge deſireth the

fountaines of water (when he is purſued)
euen ſoe my ſoule longeth after thee, o
God.
                     
                     
                        What God hath donne for
man.
CHAPT. XXI.
                        ALmightie God through his greate
loue towardes man, came vnto man,
yea he came into man, and became a man.
Throughe loue almightie God being inuiſible
in himſelfe, became viſible like vnto
his ſeruants. Through loue he was wounded
for our ſinnes.
                        In the woundes of my Sauiour, is a ſafe
and ſecure place of repoſe for thoſe that
are ſicke, and for ſinners. In them I dwell
ſecurely, for that the bowells of his mercie
are apparant by the woundes of his
body. Out of the bowells of my Lord, I
take vnto my ſelfe, whatſoeuer on my
parte is wantinge vnto me, becauſe they
flowe with mercy, neither are there holes
wanting, by which they guſh forthe
vnto me. Through the holes of his body,
the ſecrets of his harte are ſeene by me.
The ſacred miſterie of his compaſſion and
pitty doth appeare plainely vnto me; The
bowels of our Lords mercy are apparantly

ſeene, in which he hath viſited vs comming
downe from heauen.
                        The woundes of Chriſt Ieſu are full of
mercy, full of pitty, full of ſweetnes and
charitie. It is they that peirced his handes,
and his feete, and his ſide with a lance.
Through theſe holes and clefts may I taſt,
how ſweete my Lord God is, for that indeede
he is ſweete and milde, and of
much mercy, towardes all thoſe that in
the truth call vpon him towardes all thoſe
that ſeeke him, but eſpeciallie towardes
thoſe that loue him. Briefly in the wounds
of our Lord and Sauiour Chriſt Ieſus, an
infinite ranſome, a multitude of ſweetnes,
fulnes of grace, and perfection of all vertues,
is beſtowed vpon him.
                     
                     
                        Of the remembrance of the woundes
of our Lord and Sauiour Ieſus
Chriſt.
CHAPT. XXII.
                        WHen any vncleane cogitation doth a
                              •
                           
                           ſaulte
me, I am wonte to haue recourſe
to the woundes of Chriſt, as to a
preſent remedy. If at any time my rebellious
fleſh doth chance to throwe me
downe, through the remembrance of the
woundes of my Lord, I ariſe againe.

When the diuell ſeeketh to entrap me, I
forthwith fly to the bowells of my Lords
mercy and he preſentlie departeth from
me If the heate of vnlawfull luſte, doth
at any time cauſe any inordinate motion
in my fleſh; through the remembrance of
the woundes of our Lord the ſonne of
God, it is immediatlie mitigated.
                        In all aduerſities I doe not finde a more
ſoueraigne remedie, then are the wounds,
which Chriſt ſuffered for me. In them I
ſleepe ſecurely, and repoſe aſſuredly. Chriſt
hath died for vs; and therfore in deathe
nothing can be founde ſoe bitter and vnpleaſing,
which is not ſweetned and cured
by Chriſts death and paſſion.
                        My whole hope is in the deathe of my
Lord. His deathe is my merit, ſuccoure,
and ſaluation, it is my life and reſurrection;
our Lords mercy, and compaſſion is the
merit, which I rely vpon. I am not voide
of merit, aſlonge as I haue the Lord of
mercies on my parte; and ſit hence the
mercies of our Lord are many. I my ſelfe
am likewiſe riche in merits By howe
much the more powerfull he is to ſaue
me, by ſoe much the greater is my ſecuritie.
                     
                     
                        
                        Howe the remembrance of Christs,
woundes, is an approued remedie
againſt all afflictions.
CHAPT. XXIII.
                        I Haue exceedingly ſinned, and I knowe
mine offenſes to be many which I haue
committed, and yet I doe not deſpaire▪
becauſe where ſinnes haue abounded,
there grace hath ſuperabounded. He that
deſpaireth of obtaining pardon for his ſinnes,
denieth God to be mercifull. He doth
almightie God a greate iniurie, that miſtruſteth
of his mercy. As much as lieth in
him, he denieth God to haue charity,
truth and power, in which three notwithſtanding
doth depend my whole confidence,
that is, in the charitie of his adoption,
in the truth of his promiſe, and in
the power of his redemption.
                        Nowe therfore let my fooliſhe imagination
murmure as much as it will, ſaying:
Who art thou that ſpeakeſt after this
faſhion? how wonderfull greate (I pray
thee) is the glory of heauen, by what merits
then do
                              •
                           t thou hope to obtaine the
ſame? To whom I will anſwere confidently,
ſaying: I knowe to whom I haue
committed my ſelfe: for that throughe

his ſurpaſſing great charitie, he hath adopted
me to be his ſonne: becauſe he is true
in his promiſe, and able to performe the
ſame, and may doe whatſoeuer it pleaſeth
him.
                        I cannot be terrified with the multitude
of my ſinnes, if the deathe of my Lord
come into my minde, becauſe my ſinnes
cannot o
                              •
                           ercome him. The nayles and
lance doe tell me, that I am truly reconciled
to Chriſt, if I loue him. Longinus
with his lance hath opened Chriſts ſide for
me, into which I haue entred, and doe reſt
there ſecurely. He that feareth, let him
loue, becauſe loue chaſeth forth feare.
                        Verilie the whole worlde doth not afforde
ſuch a powerfull and preſent medicine
againſt the heate of diſhoneſt pleaſure,
as is the deathe of my redeemer. He
ſtretcheth for the his armes on the Croſſe,
and ſpreadeth out his handes, as one readie
to embrace ſinners. I purpoſe to liue,
and deſire to die, betweene the armes of
Chriſt that hath ſaued me. There I will
ſing ſecurely: I will extoll thee o Lord,
for that thou haſt receiued me, and haſt
not permitted mine enimies to triumphe
ouer me. Our Sauiour at his death bowed
downe his heade, that he might giue the
kiſſe of peace to his beloued. So often doe
we kiſſe God, as we are egged forwards

through his loue to doe good.
                     
                     
                        A deuoute Meditation of the ſoule,
ſtirring vs vp to the loue of
Christ.
CHAPT. XXIV.
                        O My ſoule, who art famous by being
framed according to the likenes of
God, beinge bought with Chriſts owne
blood, eſpouſed vnto him by faith, endowed
with the holy Ghoſt, adorned
with vertues, eſteemed equall with the
Angells, loue him, of whom thou art ſoe
much loued, attende to him, that attendeth
to thee, and ſeeke him that ſeeketh
thee. Loue this thy louer, of whom thou
art beloued, with whoſe loue thou art preuented,
who is the fountaine frōwhence
thy loue proceeded. He is thy merit and
rewarde, he is the fruite, the vſe, and end
of thy loue. Be carefull to pleaſe him, that
is carefull to pleaſe thee, thinke on him,
that thinketh of thee, be pure with him,
that ſurpaſſeth in puritie, be holy with
him, that excelleth all others in ſanctitie.
                        According as thou ſhalt carry thy ſelfe
towardes God in thy conuerſation, in
the ſame manner will he carrie himſelfe

towardes thee againe. He therfore being
courteous, milde, and full of mercy and
compaſſion, doth exact of thee, that thou
likewiſe be courteous, milde, ſweete, hū
                           ble,
and mercifull towardes all men.
                        Loue him (o my ſoule) who hath deliuered
thee from the lake of miſery, and
from the myre of ſinne and iniquitie.
Chooſe him for thy friende eſpeciallie,
who alone will faithfullie adhere vnto
thee, when all other thinges and friendes
ſhalbe taken from thee.
                        On the day of thy buriall, when thou
ſhalt be abandoned by all thy friendes,
he will not leaue thee, but will defende
thee from thoſe roring and infernali fiendes
ready to deuoure thee: yea he will
conduct thee throughe that vnknowne
region, and bring thee into the ſtreetes of
heauenly Syon, and will place thee there
with his Angells before the face of his
Maieſtie, where thou ſhalt heare that Angelicall
ſonge: Holy, holy, holy, &c. The
Canticle of ioy, the voice of mirthe and

                              〈◊〉
                           , thanks-giuing, praiſe, and perpetuall
Alleluia, is ſonge there euerlaſtingly.
There, there is a heape of happines, ſupereminent
glory, ſuperaboundant gladnes,
and all manner of goodnes.
                        O my ſoule ſighe vehementlie, and deſire
earneſtlie, that thou maieſt attaine to

that celeſtiall citty, of which ſoe glorious
thinges are ſaied, and in which is the
dwelling place of all thoſe that are truly
glad. By loue thou maieſt mounte vp thither:
becauſe nothing is harde, nothing is
impoſſible to an vnfained louer. The
ſoule that loueth, aſcendeth very often,
and runneth vp and downe familiarlie in
the ſtreetes of the heauenlie Hieruſalem,
viſiting the Patriarches and Prophets, ſaluting
the Apoſtles, admiring the armies
of Martyres and Confeſſores, and conſidering
the quires of Virgins. Heauen and
earthe, and all thinges in them contained,
doe continuallie exhorte me to loue my
Lord God.
                     
                     
                        How nothing can ſatisfie the ſoule, beſides
God the ſupreame good.
CHAT. XXV.
                        IT is impoſſible that the harte of man
ſhould remaine conſtant and ſtable, if
it be not ſetled in the deſire of thinges
eternall, but being more mutable then
mutabilitie it ſelfe, it paſſeth from one
thing to an other, ſeeking repoſe where
it is not: for in theſe fraile and tranſitorie
thinges (in which the affections thereof
are held captiue) it cannot content it ſelfe

and liue at quiet, becauſe it is of ſoe great
dignitie, as that nothinge but the chiefe
good is able to ſuffice it: it is likewiſe of
that freedome, as that it cannot be conſtrained
to commit any ſinne.
                        Wherfore the proper will of euery
man, is the cauſe of his damnation, or
ſaluation: neither can any thing be offered
more gratefull, then a good will vnto
almightie God. A good will doth drawe
downe God vnto vs, and direct vs vp vnto
him. By a good will we loue God, and
chooſe God, we runne to God, and come
to God, and enioy God. O howe good a
thing is a good will, by which we are renewed,
and made like vnto the image and
likenes of God.
                        Soe pleaſinge is a good will vnto him,
that he will not dwell in that harte, in
which a good will is wantinge: A good
will doth cauſe the bleſſed Trinitie (being
of vnſpeakeable Maieſtie) to come vnto
it. For God the ſonne doth enlighten the
ſame, with the knowledge of the verity.
The holy Ghoſt doth enflame it, with the
deſire of vertue. God the Father doth preſerue
in it, what he hath created, leaſt it
ſhould be loſt, and miſcarrie.
                     
                     
                        
                        What the knowledge of
veritie is.
CHAPT. XXVI.
                        BVt what is the knowledge of verity?
Firſt of all, it is to knowe thy ſelfe, &
that thou ſtudy to be ſuch an one as thou
oughteſt to be, correcting and amending
in thy ſelfe, whatſoeuer thou ſhalt perceiue
to be blame worthy. Secondly to
know & loue God, that hath created thee,
for in this conſiſteth mans whole felicitie.
                        Beholde therefore the vnſpeakeable
greatnes of Gods charitie towardes vs. He
hath created vs of nothing, and giuen vs
whatſoeuer we haue. But becauſe we
haue loued the guift more then the giuer,
the creature more then the Creator, we
haue fallen into the ſnare of the diuell by
ſinne, and ſo haue beene made ſlaues vnto
him. Neuertheleſſe God beinge moued
with mercy, hath ſent his ſonne to redeeme
his ſeruants, he hath likewiſe ſent
the holy Ghoſt to adopt thoſe that were
ſlaues and bond-men, to be his children.
He hath giuen vs his ſonne as the price of
our redemption, he hath giuen vs the
holy Ghoſt as a priuiledge of his loue and
affection; finally he reſerueth himſelfe, as

the inheritance of our adoption.
                        Thus God (as one moſt louing and full
of compaſſion) throughe the affection and
loue which he did beare to man, imparted
vnto him, not onely his riches, but
himſelfe likewiſe, to the end he might
recouer mā, not for any benefit he hoped
to reape therby, but for mans good, and
commoditie: in ſoe much that God himſelfe
was borne of men, that men might
be borne of him againe.
                        What man is there, (albeit his harte
were as harde as a ſtone) whom the loue
of God thus preuenting him doth not
mollifie and ſoften? eſpeciallie ſuch vehement
loue, that for mans ſake he hath
vouchſafed to become a man? Who can
poſſiblie thinke man worthy of hatred,
whoſe nature and ſimilitude he ſeeth in
the humanitie of God? Verily he hateth
God, that hateth man, and ſoe whatſoeuer
he doth, he doth but in vaine. For God
became man for the loue of man, that he
that is our Creator, might be likewiſe our
redeemer, to the end, man might be redeemed
by one of his owne nature
                        God likewiſe hath appeared in the likenes
of man, that he might the more familiarlie
be beloued of man, and that both
the ſenſes of man might be made bleſſed
and delighted in him; that is, the eie of

the ſoule in his diuinitie, and the eie of
the body in his humanity: that ſoe our humaine
nature by him created, might
within or without find foode in the ſame,
and be refreſhed.
                     
                     
                        What the ſending of the holy Ghost
doth effect in vs.
CHAPT. XXVII.
                        OVr Sauiour therfore hath been
borne vnto vs, he hath likewiſe ben
crucified, and hath died for vs, that by his
deathe he might deſtroy ours. And for
that his ſacred, fleſh (as a cluſter of grapes)
was caried to the preſſe of the Croſſe, and
by the preſſing of his paſſion, the ſweete
wine of his diuinity began to runne: the
holy, Ghoſt was ſent to make ready the
veſſels of mens hartes, that the new wine
might be put into new veſſels. Firſt that
mens hartes might be made cleane, that
the wine might not be ſpilt and corrupted
that was put into them: and laſtlie that
they might be hoopt and bounde faſt, that
the wine that was putt into them might
not be loſt: That they might be cleanſed
from the ioy of iniquitie, and fortified
againſt the ioy of vanity. For that which
is good, could not come, vnleſſe that,

which is euill were firſt gone. The ioy of
iniquitie doth corrupt, and the ioy of vanitie,
doth ſpill and powre out. The ioy
of iniquitie doth marre the veſſell, and
the ioy of vanitie doth fill it full of holes.
The ioy of iniquity is when ſinne is loued,
and the ioy of vanitie is when thinges trā
                           ſitorie
are affected.
                        Purge thy ſelfe therfore from all wickednes,
that thou maieſt be made a veſſell
apt to containe goodnes. Powre forthe
all bitternes, that thou maieſt be filled
with ſweetnes. The holy Ghoſt is ioy and
loue. Expell from thee the Spirit of the diuell,
and the ſpirit of this world, that thou
maieſt receiue the ſpirit of God. The ſpirit
of the diuell doth cauſe the ioy of iniquitie,
and the ſpirit of the worlde doth cauſe
the ioy of vanity. And both theſe ioyes are
amiſſe, for that the one of them is wicked,
and the other an occaſion of wickednes.
                        Theſe euill ſpirits therfore being expelled,
the ſpirit of God will come, and enter
into the tabernacle of our harte, cauſſing
a good ioy, and a good loue therein,
by which is expelled the loue of the
worlde, and the loue of ſinne. The loue
of the worlde allureth and deceiueth: the
loue of ſinne defileth and leadeth vnto
death: But conrrarily the loue of God enlightneth
the minde, cleanſeth the conſcience,

reioyceth the ſoule, and ſheweth
God apparantly vnto vs.
                     
                     
                        After what manner, he that loueth
God, carieth himſelfe.
CHAPT. XXVIII.
                        HE, in whom the loue of God maketh
abode, is alwaies thinking whē
he ſhall come to God, when he ſhall leaue
the worlde, when he ſhalbe free from the
corruption of the fleſh, hauing his harte
and affection fixed on heauenly thinges,
that by that meanes he may finde true
peace and tranquillitie of minde. When
he ſitteth, when he walketh when he reſteth,
or when he worketh, his harte departeth
not from God. He exhorteth all
men to the loue of God, and comm
                              •
                           ndeth
the ſame to euery one, declaring
vnto them by his harte, wordes and actiòs,
how ſweete the loue of God is, and how
wicked the loue of the worlde, and how
full of bitternes. He laugeth at the glory
of the worlde, reproueth thoſe that are
ouer carefull in thinges temporall, ſhewing
them what a fooliſhnes it is, to truſt
in thinges that are not durable. He wondereth
at theire blindnes, that affect theſe
thinges ſoe inordinately, and maruaileth

what ſhould be the cauſe, that all men
doe not forſake them, ſeing they are all
tranſitorie & ſoone paſſe away. He thinketh
that ſweete to all men, which is ſweet
to him, that gratefull to all men which he
he loueth, that vniuer
                              •
                           allie knowen,
which he knoweth. He oftentimes meditateth
of God, and by meditating of him,
is ſweetely refr
                              •
                           ſhed. gatheringe by ſoe
much the more profit by it, by how the
more often he doth it. For that which is
alwaies ſweete to be loued and praiſed, is
likewiſe ſweete to be conſidered.
                     
                     
                        Of true quietnes of harte.
CHAPT. XXIX.
                        THis without doubt is true quietnes
of harte, when by deſire it is wholy
fixt on the loue of God. Neither doth it
couet any thinge els, but is delighted
throughe a certaine ſweetnes, which it
findeth in that, which it doth poſſeſſe,
and by being delighted, doth exceedingly
reioyce. But if it chāce to be neuer ſoe little
diſtracted from thence throughe ſome
vaine cogitation, or worldly occaſion, it
forthwith haſtneth with all the ſpeede it
can to returne thither againe, eſteeming
the ſtay which it maketh els where, to be

worſe then any baniſhment whatſoeuer.
For as there is noe moment, in which man
doth not enioy the benefit of Gods mercie:
ſoe there ought to be noe moment,
in which he hath not God preſent in his
memorie.
                        And therfore he is guiltie of noe ſmall
ſinne, who talking with God in prayer, is
ſodainely diſtracted from his ſight, as it
were from the eies of one that doth neither
ſee, nor heare him. Which hapneth,
when any one followeth his euill, and
importunate cogitations, and preferreth
ſome baſe and ab
                              •
                           ect creature (that occurreth
to his imagination 
                              •
                            before him that
created him: that is to ſay, by muſinge
and thinking more thereof then of God,
whom he ought cōtinuallie to remember
as his Creator, to adore as his redeemer,
to expect as his Sauiour, and to dreade as
his iudge full of feare and terroure
                     
                     
                        How euery thing that hindereth the
ſoule from the ſight of God, ought
to be auoided and
detested.
CHAPT. XXX

into the cloſet of thy ſoule. exclude from
thence all thinges beſides God, and ſuch
thinges as ayde thee to ſeeke him; which
donne ſhut the dore againſt them, that
thou maieſt the better ſeeke him. Then
with thy whole harte ſay vnto God Thy
face (o Lord) is that which I deſire, thy
face is that which I ſeeke for.
                        Now therfore (o Lord my God) teach
my harte where, and how it may ſeeke
thee, where and how it may finde thee.
If thou (o Lord) art not heere preſent,
where ſhall I ſeeke thee abſent? But if
thou be euery where, why doe I not ſeeke
thee heere? Certainely this is the reaſon,
for that thou dwelleſt in that light, vnto
which noe man can attaine, how then
ſhall I attaine to that light, vnto which
noe man can attaine? Or who ſhall conduct
me, and bring me into the ſame, that
I may ſee thee therin?
                        Moreouer by what ſignes or ſemblance

ſhall I ſeeke thee? I haue neuer ſeene thee
(o Lord my God) I haue neuer knowen

                        THou o Lord, art my God and my
Lord, and ye
                              •
                            I haue neuer beheld
thee; thou haſt created and redeemed me,
and beſtowed almoſt infinite benefits vpō
me and ye
                              •
                            I haue not hitherto either ſene
or knowen thee. Finally I was made to beholde
thee, & yet I haue not hitherto permed

that, for which I was created.
                        O how much is mans misfortune to be
lamēted, ſeing he hath loſt that for which
he was created! O cruell and harde happe!
Alas what hath he loſt, and what hath he
founde? What hath departed, and what
hath remained? He hath loſt felicity, vnto
which he was created, and founde miſ
                              •
                           ry,
vnto which he was not ordained. That
hath departed, without which nothing is
happy, and that hath remained, which of
itſelfe is nothing but meere miſery. Man
heerefore did eare the breade of Angells,
which now he would gladly eate
if he coulde get it; but now he eateth the
breade of anguiſhe, being then ignorant
of it.
                        How longe (o Lord) wilt thou forget
vs, how longe wilt thou turne away thy
face from vs? when wilt thou vouchſafe
to looke vpon vs, and heare vs? When
wilt thou illuminate our eies, and ſhewe
vs thy countenance? When wilt thou
ſhewe thy ſelfe fauourable vnto vs? Looke
vpon vs (o Lord) and heare vs, enlighten
vs, and ſhewe thy ſelfe fauourable vnto
vs. Returne vnto vs, that it may goe well
with vs, becauſe without thee, it 
                              •
                           areth
amiſſe with vs.
                        Call vs vnto thee (o Lord I beſeech
thee) and helpe vs to come vnto thee. My

harte is growen bitter throughe o
                              •
                           ermuch
deſolation, ſweeten it therfore with
thy conſolation. I haue b

                           gunne to ſeeke
thee as one hungry, permit me not to depart
away empty. I approache vnto thee
as one hūger-ſtarued, let me not goe away
vnfedd. Being poore and needy I preſent
my ſelfe before thee, who art wealthie,
being in miſerie I caſt my ſelfe at the feete
of thy mercy, humbly crauing, that I may
not be ſent away as an abiect without receiuing
ſomething. I am become crooked
(o Lord) ſoe that I am not able to ſee
any other thinges but thoſe that are heere
beneathe in this vale of miſerie; raiſe me
and holde me vpright, that I may looke
vpwarde, and attēde vnto thinges that are
heauenlie. Mine iniquities haue gone ouer
mine heade, they haue ouer whelmed me,
and as a heauie burden doe oppreſſe me.
Deliuer me, & vnloade me, leaſt the infernal
pit of hel ſhut his mouthe vpon me.
                        Teache me to ſeeke thee, & ſhewe thy
ſelfe vnto me, when I ſeeke thee: for that I
cannot ſeeke thee vnleſſe thou teache me,
neither cā I finde thee vnleſſe thou vouchſafe
to ſhew thy ſelfe vnto me. Graunt me
grace therefore, that I may ſeeke thee by
deſiring thee, and deſire thee by ſeeking
thee. Graūt that I may finde thee by louing
thee, and loue thee by finding thee.
                     
                     
                        
                        Of the goodnes of God.
CHAPT. XXXII.
                        I Confeſſe o Lord, and giue thee hartie
thanks, for that it hath pleaſed thee to
create me according to thine owne image,
to the end, that being mindfull of thee. I
might cōtinuallie thinke of thee, and loue
thee But (alas) my ſoule is ſoe defaced
throughe the corruption of vice, it is ſoe
darkned through the ſmoake of ſinne, as
that it cannot accompliſhe that for which
it was created, vnleſſe thou renewe & reforme
the ſame.
                        Wherfore I beſeeche thee (o Lord) ſeing
thou haſt giuen vnderſtanding of faith,
graunt that I may likewiſe vnderſtande (as
much as is expedient) that thou art according
as we belieue, & the ſelfe 
                              •
                           ame thinge
that we belieue; & verilie we belieue thee
to be of that ſurpaſſing perfection and feature,
that nothing can poſſibly be imagined
ei
                              •
                           her greater or better.
                        What art thou then o Lord my God.
(then whom nothing greater or better
can be imagined) but that ſoueraigne and
ſupreame good, which being of it ſelfe
alone, hath made all other thinges of nothinge?
What good therfore is wanting to
the chiefeſt good, from whom all good
thinges doe proceede?
                        
                           
Thou therfore art iuſt, true, and bleſſed,
and all other thinges the more they
are in theſe like vnto thee, the greater is
theire excellencie. But ſithence thou art
ſoe exceeding iuſt, how is it, that thou
art ſoe fauourable towardes thoſe that
offende? Is it not for that thy mercie is
incomprehenſible? This is a thinge kept
ſecret in that vnacceſſible light, in which
thou doſt dwell. There without doubt
in the moſt profounde and ſecret depth
of thy bounty, is a hiddē fountaine, from
whence floweth that floude of thy vnſpeakeable
mercy. For albeit thou art
wholie and perfectly iust, yet neuertheleſſe
thou art likewiſe merciful towards
the wicked, for that thou art alſo wholy
and perfectly good. For if thou were
mercifull towardes none that commit
wickednes, it were an argument that thy
goodnes were the leſſe: becauſe he that
is good both to the good and bad, is
better then him, that is good onely to
the good: he likewiſe is better, who is
good to the wicked by pardonning, and
puniſhing them, then he that ſhould puniſhe
them onely. Thou therfore art
mercifull, becauſe thou art wholy and
perfectly good.
                     
                     
                        
                        Of the pleaſant fruition of almighty
God.
CHAPT. XXXIII.
                        O Infinite goodnes, who ſurpaſſeſt
all humaine ſenſe, let thy mercy
deſcende downe vpon me, which proceedeth
from thee in ſoe greate plenty.
Let that flowe into me, which floweth
from thee. Pardon me by thy mildnes,
leaſt thou puniſh me by thy iuſtice. Stirre
vp thy ſelfe now (o my ſoule) applie thy
whole wit, and imagination, and conceiue
as much as thou canſt, how great a
good God is. For if all good thinges in
particular are delightfull and pleaſinge,
conſider with attention how delightful
that good thing is, which containeth in
it the delight of al good thinges: neither
is it like to that delight which is founde
in thinges created, but as farre different
as the creator doth differ from his creature.
                        If then the life created be ſoe pleaſing,
how pleaſing is the life that created the
ſame? If that healthe which is made be
ſoe delightfull, how delightfull is that,
from whence all healthe hath his originall?
If wiſedome be amiable by the ſpeculation
or knowledge of thinges that
are knowen, how amiable is that wiſedome,

which hath framed and formed all
thinges of nothinge? Finally if the pleaſures
proceeding from pleaſant thinges
be ſoe manifolde & great, how vnſpeakable
great pleaſure is there in him, who

                              •
                           ath made all pleaſant thinges?
                        He therefore that ſhall enioy this ſoe
great a good, what ſhall he haue, yea
what ſhall he not haue? Verilie he ſhall
haue whatſoeuer he is willing, and what
he is vnwillinge to haue, ſhall be farre
from him. For there he ſhall enioy thoſe
delightes of ſoule and bodie, which neither
the eie hath ſeen, nor the eare hath
hearde, neither hath it entred into the
hearte of man.
                     
                     
                        That the chiefe good is to be deſired.
CHAPT. XXXIV.
                        WHy doſt thou then wander vp and
downe o vaine man in things tranſitorye
ſeekinge pleaſures and content
for thy ſoule and body? Loue that
one good thing, in whom are all good
thinges, and it is ſufficient. Deſire that
ſingular & ſole good, which is all good,
and it is enoughe.
                        Tell me (o my fleſh) what doſt thou
loue? What doſt thou deſire (o my ſoule)
In heauen thou ſhalt finde whatſoeuer
thou doſt loue, there thou ſhalt

finde whatſoeuer thou doſt deſire. If
thou deſire beauty or comelines of perſonne,
there the righteous ſhall ſhine
like vnto the ſunne. If nimblenes, or
ſtrength, or freedome of body (ſuch as
nothing can hurte or hinder) they ſhall
be like the Angells of God: becauſe that
which is ſowen a naturall body, ſhall ariſe
a ſpirituall body, to wit, in power
not in nature. If a longe and healthfull
life, there ſhalbe healthfull eternity, and
eternall health: becauſe the iuſt ſhall liue
for euer, and the healthe of the iuſt is
from our Lord.
                        If fulnes, they ſhalbe ſatisfied, when
the glorie of God ſhall appeare. If drunkennes,
they ſhall be made drunke with
the plentie of Gods houſe. If muſique
doth delight thee, there the Angels ſhall
ſing praiſes to God euerlaſtingly. If pure
& chaſt pleaſure doth pleaſe thee, there
our Lord ſhall make them to drinke of
the riuer of his delight. If thou wiſhe
for wiſedome, the verie wiſedome of
God ſhall ſhew himſelfe (being the true
wiſedome) vnto them. If thou affect amitie
or friendſhip, they ſhall loue God
more then themſelues, and one another
euen as themſelues: and God shall loue
them more then they themſelues, becauſe
they shall loue him, themſelues, &

one an other by him, and he shall loue
himſelfe and them by himſelfe.
                        If thou loue peace and concorde; they
shalbe all of one will, becauſe they shalt
haue noe other will, but the ſoueraigne
will of God. If thou deſire rule and dignities,
they shall be omnipotent of their
wil, euen as God is of his: For euen as
God shalbe able to doe whatſoeuer he
will by himſelfe, ſoe shall they be able
to doe whatſoeuer they will by him: for
like as they shal deſire nothing but what
he shalbe willing to doe; ſoe he shalbe
willing to doe whatſoeuer they wil haue
him, and what he wil haue to be donne,
muſt of neceſſitie be put in execution.
                        If thou aſpire to honoure and riches?
God shall place his good and faithfull
ſeruants, ouer much riches: Moreouer
they shalbe called the ſonnes of God,
yea very Gods: and shalbe the heires of
God, and coheires with Chriſt. If thou
ſeeke ſecuritie, they shalbe ſoe aſſured
neuer to looſe it of their owne accorde,
as they shalbe aſſured that God, who ſoe
dearely loueth them, will not forcibly
take it frō them, as they shalbe aſſured,
that there is nothing of ſufficiēt power,
to ſeparate God and them one from an
other. With what wordes then can ſoe
great a ioy be expreſſed, where ſoe great
a good is poſſeſſed?
                     
                     
                        
                        Of the mutuall charity of the Saintes
in heauen.
CHAPT. XXXV.
                        O Harte of man, poore, & experienced
in croſſes and calamities, yea
ouerwhelmed with miſeries, how greatlie
wouldeſt thou reioyce, if thou didſt
abounde with all theſe aforeſaid felicities!
Demaunde of the moſt ſecret corners
and cloſets of thy hart, whether
they could containe the gladnes, which
would proceede frō ſoe great happines.
Certainely if an other, whom thou didſt
loue aſwell as thy ſelfe, shoulde enioy
the ſame happines, thy ioy woulde be
twice more then before, becauſe thou
wouldeſt reioyce noe leſſe for him, then
for thy ſelfe. But if two or three, or manie
more should obtaine the ſame felicitie,
thou wouldeſt reioyce as much for
each one of them as for thy ſelfe, if thou
didſt loue each one of them as thy ſelfe.
                        How vnſpeakable great ioy wil there
be then, in that perfect charitie of innumerable
bleſſed Angells and men, where
noe man shall loue an other leſſe then
himſelfe? For euery one of them shal reioyce
as much for eache one of the reſt,
as for himſelfe. If therfore the harte of
man shal hardlie be able to containe the

ioy which it shall conceiue at his owne
proper good, how will it be capable of
ſoe infinite many and great ioyes?
                        Moreouer ſeeing by how much the
more euerie one loueth an other, by ſoe
much the more he reioyceth at the others
good: therfore as in that bleſſed
felicity euery one without compariſon,
shall loue God more then himſelfe and
all others that are with him, ſoe he shall
beyond all eſtimation, farre more reioyce
at the felicitie of God, then at his
owne, and all others that are with him.
And albeit they shall loue God with
their whole harte, minde, and ſoule; yet
all theſe art not ſufficient to declare the
dignitie of that loue, which God will
shew towardes them: Verilie although
they shal reioyce with their whole hart,
minde, and ſoule; yet all theſe are not
enough to containe the fullnes of ioy,
which he will imparte vnto them.
                     
                     
                        Of the full and perfect ioy of life
euerlasting.
CHAPT. XXXVI.
                        O My God, and my Lord, my hope,
and the ioy of my harte, tell my
ſoule (I beſeech thee) if this be the ioy,
of which thou haſt ſpoken vnto vs by
thy Sonne ſaying. Aske, and you shall

haue, that your ioy may be full. Becauſe
I haue founde a certaine ioy altogether
full, yea more then ful. In ſoe much that
the harte being full, the minde being
full, the ſoule being full, and euerie
parte of man being full, there shall
remaine, yet an other ioy much more
excellent then the former. All that
whole ioy therfore shall not enter into
thoſe that reioyce, but al they that wholie
reioyce, shall enter into the ioy of
their Lord.
                        Tell me o Lord, tell me thy poore vnworthy
ſeruant in wardly in my harte, if
this be the ioy into which thy ſeruants
shall enter, thoſe I meane, that shall enter
into the ioy of their Lord. But certainely
that ioy, in which thy elect shall
reioyce, neither eie hath ſeene, nor care
hath hearde, neither hath it entred into
the harte of man. I haue not therfore as
yet conceiued or ſpoken how much thy
elect shall reioyce. Doubtles they shall
reioyce as much as they shall loue thee;
and they shal loue thee (o Lord) as much
as they shall know thee. And how much
shall they loue thee? Verily neither eie
hath ſeene, nor eare hath hearde, neither
hath it entred into the harte of man in
this life, how much they shall knowe
and loue thee in the next life.
                        
                           
Giue me grace (o my God) to knowe
and loue thee, to the end I may reioyce in
thee. And albeit during the time of this
mortal life I cannot loue thee fully, yet let
me profit and goe forewarde by louinge
thee more and more daylie, that ſoe at
length I may loue thee perfectly. Let thy
knowledge here encreaſe in me, that
there it may be accompliſhed, that here
my ioy may be greate in hope, and there
perfect in deede.
                        I beſeech thee o good God, let me at
length receiue that which thou haſt promiſed,
to wit, that my ioy may be fully
accompliſhed. In the interim, let my mind
mediate of it, let my tongue talke of it,
let my harte affect it, let my mouth ſpeake
of it, let my ſoule hunger for it, let my
body thirſt after it, let my whole ſubſtāxsce,
deſire it, vntill I enter into the ioy of my
Lord, there to remaine for all eternitie. Amen.

                  A WONDERFVL AND
worthy ſaying of bleſſed S. Peter
Damian Monke of the holy order of
S. Bennet, Cardinal of Oſtia, concerning
the day of death.
                  
                     LEt vs imagin how the time being
now come, in which the
ſinfull ſoule is to be ſeperated
from the bandes of the body,
with how grieuous feare it is
terrified, with how greate anguiſhe of an
afflicted conſcience it is tormented. It remembreth
the thinges forbidden, which
it hath committed, it beholdeth the commaundments
of God▪ which through negligence
and contempt it hath omitted It
grieueth that the time, which i
                        •
                      had to
doe pennance, hath bene ſoe vainely employed,
it groaneth that the immutable
moment of ſeuere reuenge is ſoe neare at
hāde, not poſſibly to be auoided. It would
faine ſtay, it is forced to depart. It would
faine recouer that which it hath loſt, and
cannot be hearde. It looketh backward
vpon the courſe of its whole life paſt, and
eſteemeth it to be but as it were one onelie
little peace, it looketh forewarde, and
ſeeth infinite worldes of time, which ſhall
neuer haue end. It lamenteth therfore for

hauing loſt the ioyes of all eternitie, which
it might haue gained ſoe quickly It weepeth
likewiſe, that for ſoe ſhort pleaſure
of the alluring fleſh, it is bereaued of the
vnſpeakeable ſweetnes of euerlaſting happines.
It bluſheth to ſee, that for that ſubſtance
ſake, which is to be m
                        •
                     ate for wormes
it hath neglected that, which ſhould
haue bin placed amongſt the quires of
Angells
                  At length it lifteth vp the eies of its
minde, and conſidering the glory of the
immortall riches of heauen, it is aſhamed,
that for the loue of the begge
                        ••
                     e of this
preſent life, it hath loſt that glory. Againe
when it looketh downewarde vpon the
vale of this worlde, as vpon a miſte, and
contrariwiſe ſeeing aboue it the brightnes
of that eternall light, it plainely perceiueth,
that which it loued was but darknes,
and night. if it coulde obtaine the
fauoure to haue ſome little 
                        •
                     ime allotted
to doe pennance and ſatisfaction, how auſtere
would it be in life and conuerſation?
how many and how greate maters would
it promiſe to performe? How ſtrictly
would it binde it ſelfe to piety and deuotion?
In the meane ſeaſon, whilſt the eieſight
faileth, whilſt the harte panteth,
whilſt the throate (the voyce being loſt)
doth drawe breath with difficulty, whilſt

the teeth by little and little growe black,
and as it were ruſty, whilſt the countenance
groweth pale, and all the members
of the body become ſtiffe through colde,
whilſt theſe thinges (I ſay) and other ſuch
like happen, as certaine ſignes of deathe
approaching, all its workes and wordess
preſent themſelues before it, yea its very
thoughtes are not wanting, and all theſe
giue bitter teſtimony againſt it, as againſt
the author of them. All its ſinnes and iniquitie,
are laied as it were in heapes before
its eies, and thoſe, which it is vnwilling
to ſee, it is forced to beholde, whither
it will or noe.
                  Moreouer on the one ſide of it▪ it beholdeth
a terrible troupe of dreadfull diuells,
on the other ſide, a multitude of heauenly
Angells. The ſoule that lieth in the
middeſt, quickly perceiueth, to which of
theſe companies it appertaineth; For if
there be ſeene in it the ſignes and tokens
of goodnes, it is conforted by the comfortable
ſpeeches of the Angells, and by the
ſweetnes of their harmonious mellody, it
is allured to come forthe of the body.
Contrariwiſe, if the darknes, of its deſ

                        〈◊〉
                      forthwith
ſtrooken with intolerable feare, it is
troubled through the force of the ſodaine

violence, that is vſed; it is throwne downe
beadlonge, and aſſaulted, and poore ſoule,
is forciblie pluckt out of the priſon of the
fleſh, that it may be d
                        •
                      awne to eternall
torments with vnſpeakeable bitternes.
                  Now after it is departed out of the
body, who is able to e
                        •
                      preſſe, how many
armed troupes of wicked ſpirits doe ly in

                        •
                     e to entrappe it? how many bandes
of frouning fiēdes (being ready with cruell
tormēts to afflict it) doe beſet the way, to
hinder its paſſage? And to the end it may
not be able to eſcape and paſſe through
them, whole legions of them being gathered
together (after the manner of ſouldiers)
doe aſſault the ſame.
                  Wherfore to conſider theſe and ſuch
like thinges by frequent meditation, is a
ſoueraigne meane to contemne the enticing
allurements of ſinne, to abandon the
worlde, and to ſubdue the vnlawfull motions
of the fleſh, and finally doth cauſe
and conſerue in vs a continuall deſire of
