TREASVRE
OF VOWED
CHASTITY
in secular Persons.
            Also the
WIDDOWES
GLASSE.
            VVritten by the RR. Fathers Leonard
Lessius, and Fuluius Androtius,
both of the Society of Iesus.
            Translated into English by
I. W. P.

            TO THE
HONORABLE
AND RIGHT
vertuous Gentlewomā,
Mrs. Anne Vaux.
            
               HONORABLE,
AND RIGHT
VVORTHY,
The constant
report of your vertuous

life, in the State whereof
this little Booke entreateth,
hath inuited me to
entitle the same vnto
your Name in particuler,
which was written for
the profit of all in generall,
who haue a true desire
to imbrace the State
of vowed Chastity, and
yet remaine in the world
among secular persons.
            If the subiect seeme
new, or strange to any,
I doubt not, but hauing

attentiuely read, & considered
the seuerall passages
therein, they will remaine
abundantly satisfyed.
For it was no part
of the Authors intention
(who is knowne to be famous,
both for learning
and piety) thereby to derogate
frō other Stats of
life; but rather, by shewing
the good, & commodity,
which may proceed
by imbracing of this;
those that be more perfect

in themselues, might
heerby, be the more honoured,
and reuerenced
of all.
            Neither, indeed, is
there any thing at al proposed
in this ensewing
Discourse, which hath
not been practised in the
Primitiue Church, by
persons of both sexes; &
for that cause so much
admired, and extolled by
the auncient Fathers of
those dayes: Howsoeuer

the same may seeme not
to haue beene in some later
ages, so much in vse,
and therefore thought
now behoofefull to be again
renewed to our memory,
in these tymes of
so great necessity, for the
spirituall good of soules,
and increase of Charity,
now halfe extinguished
in the Christian
world.
            The profit that may,
& doth redound to such

as desire to practise this
state of vowed Chastity,
remaining in the world,
will neither be small, or
vncertaine, if the same
be imbraced with that
sincerity of hart and vertuous
manner of life as it
ought: wherein I know
your selfe to haue made
good proofe, these many
years, by reaping a plentiful
haruest of the fruits,
and heaping vp a masse
of Treasure, against the

comming of your heauē
               ly
Spouse, to present him
withall, to the vnspeakeable
comfort and consolation
of your soules eternall
Happynes.
            To this little Treatise,
I haue adioyned the
WIDDOVVES GLASSE,
the which I humbly intreate
you, to present, in
my Name, to your two
most worthy Sisters, who
for the long, constant, &
most exemplar professiō
               
of that noble, and worthy
state of chast Widdowhood,
may seeme to
clayme a iust Title therunto.
But I deemed not
my labour in translating
it, worthy to be presented
to so honourable Matrons,
in a Dedicatory a
part: not doubting but
the same wilbe more grateful,
comming through
your handes, who are so
neere a kin vnto them,
both by Nature & Grace;

seeing Virginity, and
Widdowhood, haue euer
been accounted Sisters,
and betroathed to the
same Eternall Spouse
Christ Iesus.
            Accept then (Right
worthy Gentlewoman)
these few sheets of paper,
by me translated out of
Latin, as a future earnest
of som better gift, wherwith
I intend to present
you ere it be long. And
in the meane tyme, among

the many of your
pious and deuout exercises,
forget him not, who
will euer remaine
            
               Your deuoted
seruant,
I. W.
            
         
      
      
         
            
               
                  
                  THE
GOOD AND
COMMODITY
Of the state of life, which
some professe, liuing in
the world, and vowing
Chastity.
                  
                     THERE be not
wāting in these
our dayes, amongst
secular
persōs very many,
as well Widdowes, as

Virgins, who aspyring to
perfection, haue a desire (as
farre as they may conueniently)
to sequester themselues
from the troubles and
incombrāces of the world,
thereby to imploy their
mindes more freely and securly
in the seruice of God.
                  For whome notwithstanding,
to liue in Monasteryes,
either it is not so
cōuenient, or els (grounded
vpon sufficiēt reasons) they
may be otherwise resolued.
For the wayes & manners
of seruing God are diuers,
& those who cannot aspire

to the highest & most perfect,
are not therefore constrayned
to content themselues
with the meanest &
least noble.
                  Wherfore many there be
who liuing in the world,
reiecting the vanity of rich
and costly apparell, and taking
a plaine & simple habit,
consecrate their Virginity
to Almighty God; and
auoyding the conuersation
of secular persons (as much
as they may) do imploy thē
                     selues
wholy in the offices
of Charity and Deuotion.
                  Yet neuerthelesse, because

there be not wanting
som, who (I know not out
of what zeale) carpe at the
Institution of such manner
of life, I am for this respect
wonne, at the intreaty of a
special friend, to declare out
of holy Scripture, and ancient
Fathers, in what degree
such kind of life in the
Catholike Church is to be
esteemed: for the satisfaction
of whom in a matter of
such importance, and so
much pertayning to the
good of soules, I haue purposed
to handle it in eight
little Chapters following,

where, in the first, it is proued
out of holy Scripture,
that this kind of life is pious
and laudable.
                  In the second, the same
is proued by Exāples out of
holy Scripture, and Ecclesiasticall
historyes.
                  In the third, the same is
conuinced by the Authorityes
of holy Fathers.
                  In the fourth, the same is
confirmed by Theologicall
Arguments.
                  In the fifth, the same is
also confirmed out of the
good & commodity which
ensue of Chastity.
                  
                     
The sixt, contayneth a
solution to certaine obiections
made, concerning the
merits of Marriage & Chastity.
                  The seauenth, setteth
downe certaine admonitions
& aduices, to be exactly
followed in this estate.
                  The eight, sheweth that
this manner of life, is truly
and properly called an Estate.
                  
                     
                     CHAP. I. VVherin it is proued out of Scripture,
that, that kind of life,
wherin some, Men or VVomē,
liuing in the world, leauing of
costly apparrell, & vsing plain
and modest attire, doe vow
Chastity, is laudable and meritorious
before God.
                     THERE be many in
this age who vsing ouer
much the liberty of
their owne Iudgments, disallow
of this kind of life:
yet by what reasons, or vpon
what grounds they are
moued so to do, besids those

which Iouinian the ancient
heretike (& those also of his
coate euen in these tymes)
hath alleadged, I cannot imagine.
Neither do I think
they haue any other, vnles
perhaps they consider the
difficulties which this mā
                        ner
of life is subiect vnto, &
are terrifyed with more
dangers of liuing chast in
this, then in the state of religion.
For which cause
they may thinke it more secure
to vow Chastity in the
one, then in the other. But
neuerthelesse it is to be held
as a point of faith, that this

State is not only lawful, but
also commendable, and of
great merit before Almighty
God; and the same practised
not only of men, and
women, but also of youth
it selfe.
                     This is euidently conuinced
out of holy Scriptur,
wher our Lord himself
(Matth. 9.) doth openly cō
                        mend
this Institution. For
first when the Apostls hearing
the speaches of our
Blessed Sauiour cōcerning
Marriage, answered, Si ita
est &c. If such be the condition
of man, linked vnto a

wife (to wit, that it is lawfull
to haue but one, neither
to be so separated from that
one, that whiles she liues he
may take another) it is better
not to marry, & incurre
such a seruitude. To whom
our Lord replyed, approuing
that which they had
sayd: Non omnes capiunt &c.
al apprehēd not this speach
but only such to whome it
is giuen: for there be those
who haue made themselues
Eunuches for the kingdom
of heauen &c. He who can
vnderstand this, let him
vnderstand it.
                     
                        
Heere our Lord spake
of single life in generall,
commending the same also
in those who liue in the
world; first, when approuing
the answere of his
aforesayd Apostles (who
then thought not of liuing
in Monasteryes, or being
Religious) he sayd: Non omnes
capiunt &c. All apprehend
not this word; as though
he should haue sayd, you
rightly infer, that it is not
conuenient to marry, but
few there be who vnderstand
a thing of so great, &
high a Mystery.
                     
                        
Secondly, when distinguishing
three sorts of Eunuches,
he sheweth, that
those do greatly please him,
who haue made themselues
Eunuches, that is to say,
who haue exempted themselues
from Marriage, for
the Kingdome of heauen:
To wit, that being thereby
made more free, from the
burthen of such a clogge,
they may runne the faster
vnto it, and enioy it more
safely and aboundantly.
                     Thirdly when he saith,
He that can vnderstād this
mystery, let him vnderstād

it: as if he should haue said,
I cōstraine no man, but exhort
al, for it is a great benefit
to abstaine from mariage
for the kingdome of God.
Therefore he who hath so
great a courage, that he hopeth
he shalbe able to aprehend
& imbrace so great a
good, let him not neglect it.
                     Wherefore since our
Lord did not only cōmend
this state in generall, but
also in particuler according
to which the apostles vnderstood
him, & which might
haue been practized at that
tyme; it followeth manifestly,

that the same is commendable,
and most acceptable
vnto God, being practised
also by those that liue
in the world.
                     Neither can it be said,
that our Lord spake not of
the vow of Chastity, but
onely of the simple purpose
and vse therof: for to be
made an Eunuch, is not only
to abstaine from Mariage,
but also to bereaue
ones selfe of al ability therof,
and of all other carnall
pleasure; which is done in
effect also, by the vow of
Chastity. For euen as the

corporall making one an
Eunuch, cuts off all sufficiency
of carnall act, or delight:
So likewise the spirituall
making one an Eunuch,
which is effected by
the vow of chastity, disinables
al morall faculty so farre,
that we may not vse any
such delight lawfully, making
it morally impossible
(as it is incompatible with
Iustice) to do it. For what
we cannot lawfully do,
may be absolutely said, that
we cannot do, and is said to
be (iustly) impossible.
                     From whence it is, that

holy Fathers vsually out of
this place of Scripture proue
the vow of Chastity, because
a spirituall making
one an Eunuch, cannot be
otherwise effected, then by
vow. See S. Augustine in his
booke of holy Virginity,
cap. 30. S. Hierom in his book
against Iouinian, and vpon
this place of S. Matthew
cap. 19. The same is cleerly
proued out of the Apostle 1.
Corinth. 7. where he greatly
prayseth singlenes of life,
professed in diuers manners
of estate, and obserued also
in the world, and in priuat

howses, for as then Monasteryes
were not yet begun.
Dico innuptis &c. I speak both
to the vnmaried, & to Widdowes,
that it is good for
thē to remain in that estate,
as I haue also done. And againe:
I would haue al be as I my
selfe, that is, I desire that all
should be continēt, as it wil
appeare out of that which
follows. De Virginibus &c. As
for those that are virgins, I
haue no expresse commission
to them from our Lord,
but I giue them Counsell
(to wit, that they remain in
their Virginity) as hauing

obteyned mercy of Almighty
God, to be faithfull,
&c. And againe, Si nupserit
virgo &c: If a virgin marry,
she sinneth not, but such
notwithstanding shal haue
the tribulation of the flesh,
that is to say, many troubls
cares, and afflictions &c. Againe:
Igitur qui &c. Therfore
he which giueth a virgin
in mariage, doth well,
but he which doth it not,
doth better. Also, Beatior erit
&c. she shalbe more happy
if she remaine so still (to
wit vnmarried) according
vnto my aduice, for I think

that euen I my selfe, haue
the spirit of God. In al these
places the Apostle comends
the loue of Chastity, and
Virginity, euē in the world
and in priuate howses, as it
was obserued at that tyme.
                     For in Ancient tymes,
when the faithfull were
most deuout, many followed
the aduice of our Sauiour,
in such manner, as they
had then oportunity to do
it, as is manifest out of the
Acts of the Apostles; where
many hauing sould their
goods & bestowed the money
in common, imbraced

pouerty. It is very probable
therfore, that there were a
greater nūber of those who
imbraced Chastity, then
others, both because that
vertue was more noble and
profitable, and also because
there might be many poore
folks which had not goods
and possessions to sell, or if
they had, yet perhaps could
not sell them; all which
notwithstanding might
professe Chastity.
                     Neither is it to be doubted,
but that many obliged
themselues by vow thereunto,
since they imbraced it

out of a desire of perfection
and zeale to please Almighty
God. And it is more
perfect a great deale to keep
it with an entire resolutiō,
then only with an vncertaine
and mutable purpose.
                     Finally also, because they
imbraced it out of the motiue
of our Sauiours owne
aduise and commendation
therof; and that which our
Sauiour cōmended was the
voluntary making of themselues
Eunuches, which is
effected by vow, as hath bin
said before. The same is collected
also out of the Apostle

1. Tim. 5. Adolescentiores
viduas &c. Take none of the
younger sort of widowes,
&c. which is meant that
they should not be admitted
into the function or ministery
of diaconisses, or into the
number of the Alumnae or Pupills
of the Church. Cùm enim
&c. for that, saith S. Paul, after
they haue liued licentiously
in Christ, at last also
they will not sticke to marry,
frustrating their former
Faith: that is, they will
breake the vow of Chastity
which they had made before;
for the word Fayth, is

taken in this place for Promise,
or obligation dew by
promise: as for example, to
give ones Faith, is to giue
ones promise, to keepe fayth,
is to keepe promise, to frustrate
sayth giuen before, is
to breake promise, and a
promise made to God, is a
vow.
                     From hence it is manifest,
that it was a custom in
the primitiue Church, for
Widdowes also to vow
Chastity, so that without a
mortall sin, & being guilty
of damnation, they could
not marry againe: besides

that, euery act of Concupiscence,
yea and the very
marriage it self was iniury
against Christ; for so much
is signified in these words,
After they haue liued licentiously
in Christ, that is to say, after
they haue liued lasciuiously
and luxuriously, wroning
our Sauiour Christ,
to whome they had bound
themselues by vow, and
were become espowsed to
him, at length also they
will not sticke to marry.
After this manner the Coū
                        cell
of Carthage the 104. Canon,
and S. Chrysostome vpon

this place, and S. Hierome in
his epistle to Herontia de Monogamia,
and others, do expound
it.
                     This place is to be noted
& pondered of all such
as haue made vow to Almighty
God of perpetuall
Chastity, for that without
being guilty of eternall dā
                        nation,
they can neither
marry (especially with an
intention to consummate)
nor otherwise enioy carnal
delight, which also is the
opinion of all the Fathers,
who interprete this place
to be of promise made vnto

God by the vow of Chastity.
                     Finally wheresoeuer holy
Scripture commendeth
Virginity, it speaketh in generall;
neither is it to be restrained
vnto those alone,
who liue in Monasteryes,
And all rewards and priuiledges
of Virginity there
rehearsed, belong vnto all
holy Virgins, as in the 3.
chap. of the Booke of VVisedome:
Faelix est sterilis &c. happy
is she that is barren and
vndefiled, which neuer
knew any impure bed, she
shall haue fruite in the behoulding

of soules that are
blessed &c. Apoc. 14. It is
granted only vnto Virgins
(sequi Agnum quocumq, ierit) to
follow the Lambe wheresoeuer
he goeth, and to sing
that new Hymne in Isay 56.
To Eunuches which keep
Gods diuine Commandements,
is promised an euerlasting
name, and a high
place, and a degree in the
Citty of Almighty God.
                     Some will obiect that,
that place of the Apostle 1.
Tim. 5. saying: Volo iuniores
nubere &c. I would haue the
younger sort to marry, to

bring forth Children and
keep house &c. makes cleare
against that which we haue
sayd. To this I answere,
that it is not to be vnderstood
of all Widdowes that
are young, but only of those
which cannot liue continent,
and are not otherwise
obliged by any vow: for it
is better that such should
marry, then liue incontinent,
and giue scandall to
the vnfaythfull, as the Apostle
insinuateth in the
same place.
                     Also the holy Father S.
Chrysostome in his 15. Homily
                        
vpon the 1. to Timothy, affirmeth,
that the Apostle speaketh
there of such widows,
who being freed from the
yoake and gouernement of
their husbands, liue dissolutly,
become idle, pratlers,
wanton, curious, running
vp and down to their neighbours
houses, & the like.
And it is manifest out of the
text it selfe that the Apostle
speaketh of such, when he
sayth: Volo &c. I would haue
the younger sort to marry.
S. Ambrose also in his booke
of VViddowes explicateth S.
Paul. Pro remedio suasit nuptias

&c. he perswaded Marriage
as a remedy, but not prescribed
it as a choice. S.
Hierome in his 8. Epistle to
Saluina, asking: Cur nuptias
Paulus indulserit &c. Why did
S. Paul fauour Marriage?
Presently he addeth: I am
quaedam &c. Some haue already
declined after Sathā:
whereby we may vnderstand,
sayth S. Hierome, that
these speaches rather signify
a helping hand to be lent to
those that are fallen, then
the reward of a crowne to
those which stand firme:
See then (sayth he) what

these second Marriages be,
which are yet to be preferred
before the condition of
a Brothell-house: for some
haue declined after Sathan;
therefore a young Widdow
which cannot, or will not
containe her selfe, let her
rather take a husband then
the diuel. So S. Hierome Out
of which it appeares that it
is not conuenient for all
young Widdowes to marry,
but onely such who
are subiect to the vices aboue
named, to wit, in
whome there is manifest
danger of Incontinency, or

which cannot liue chast,
or will not vse meanes to
do it.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. II. The same is proued by examples
out of holy Scripture, and the
custome of the Church, most
frequently practised from the
first beginning of Religion euen
vnto these dayes.
                     FIRST of all, doth here
present her selfe our
blessed Lady, as guide and
Author of this Iustitution,
who liuing in the world at
her owne command, and
free from being subiect to

any other, reseruing also
her proper goods, vowed
vnto God perpetuall virginity,
& this either before,
or immediatly after her
Marriage.
                     And truly, if before her
marriage (as it is most likely
she did, and S. Augustin in his
Book of holy virginity cap.
4. doth thinke most probable)
then she contracted
not marriage afterwards of
her owne accord, but rather
moued thereunto by
diuine Reuelatiō, by which
also she was assured that
there should be no danger

to loose her virginity, and
that her husbād also should
binde himselfe by the like
vow of Chastity; wherfore
she neuer consented neither
expresly, nor in effect to any
matrimoniall Act. For albeit
that in the contract of
Marriage, there is power
giuen to the husband ouer
his wiues body, yet by this
reuelation she was assured
that it should in her neuer
actually take effect. And as
she for her part had chosen
to preuent it, so likewise
her husband should presētly
do the like.
                     
                        
But if she made her vow
after Marriage, it is to be
sayd that she contracted
Marriage, not with an absolute
consent to consumat
the same, but in such manner
as she referred her selfe
wholy to the prouidence
of Almighty God, relying
altogeather vpon his diuin
will and pleasure. Moreouer
it is most manifesty probable
that our Blessed Lady
had vowed Chastity,
out of these wordes of S.
Luke: Q
                              •
                           omodo fied istu
                              •
                            &c.
How shal this com to passe,
since I know not man? that

is to say, how shall I conceiue
a Sonne, that cannot
know Man, because I am
boūd by my vow of Virginity?
for so the holy Fathers
Athanasius, serm. de sanctissima
Deipara, Gregory Nissen in his
Oration on the birth of our
Sauiour, S. Augustine in his
booke of holy Virginity cap.
4. S. Bernard in his fourth
sermon super missus est &c. do
teach; and reason it selfe
doth likewise manifestly
conuince. For otherwise
her obiection to the Angell
had beene to no purpose,
since it might haue beene

answered vnto her, Now
thou shalt know man, and
conceaue. Therefore her
obiection, I know not man, is
the same, that I cannot know
man: euen as he who hath
vowed to abstaine from
flesh or wine being inuited
sayth: I eate not flesh, I drinke
not wine, I frequent not banquets
&c.
                     
                     An innumerable multitude
of Virgins presently
followed the example of
our B. Lady, in so much
that one howse, to wit of
Philip the deacō, had 4. daughters
remayning virgins, as

it is manifest out of the Acts
of the Apostles Chap. 21.
who also were indued with
the spirit of Prophecy, as it
is there said: which as S.
Hierome witnesseth in his
Epistle to Demetriades, was
granted them as a reward
of their Virginity.
                     
                        S. Philip the Apostle before
his Apostleship, brought
vp three daughters also,
wherof two remayned virgins
till they were very old
as Policrates in S. Hierome reporteth
De Scrip. Ecclesiast. in
Polycrate.
                     
                     
                        S. Petronilla daughter S. Peter
                        
vowed virginity, and for
feare of loosing it, obteyned
soden death from Almighty
God.
                     S. Tecla at the perswasion
of S. Paul, imbraced the
same, as S. Ambrose witnesseth
in his second booke
of Virgins.
                     
                        S. Iphigenia daughter to
the King of Ethiopia, by the
counsell of S. Matthew, as
Abdias writeth in her life.
                     
                        Flauia Domitilla daughter
to Clemens the Consull,
& S. Peters host at Rome, at
the perswasion of S. Clemēt,
as S. Bede witnesseth in his

Martyrologe the 7. of May,
or as it is set downe in his
life, at the perswasion of
Nereus and Achilleus.
                     
                     
                        S. Valeria at the perswasiō
of S. Martialis, as appeareth
out of his Epistle ad Tholosanos,
Chap. 8.
                     
                        S. Pudentiana & her sister
Praxedes, by the Counsell
of the Apostles, or Apostolicall
men.
                     
                        Finally S. Anatolia, Apollonia,
Balbina, Barbara, Pelagia,
Catherina, Caecilia, Agatha,
Agnes, Lucia, Basilla, Christina,
Dorothea, Emerentiana, Prisca,
Euphemia, Saturnina, Susanna,

Victoria, Theodora, and innumerable
others contynued
virgins, in the world, euen
to their death, and honoured
their virginity with the
crowne of Martyrdome.
                     
                     Moreouer it is manifest
out of S. Cyprian, S. Ambrose &
S. Hierome with other holy
Fathers, that there were in
those ages infinite who cō
                        secrated
their virginity to
Almighty God, although
they entred not into Monasteries,
but dwelt either
in their Parents howses, or
in their owne, retayning
the vse of their proper

goods, or els liued many
together in comon.
                     The same appeareth also
out of the testimony of Faustus
Manichaeus in S. Augustine,
in his 30. boke against Faustus
the 4. Chap. where Faustus
thus obiecteth. Necvidetis
hinc &c. Neither do you see
heere, both your virgins to
be noted of being deceaued
by the doctrine of the Diuell,
and your selues to become
his Prelats, who contentiously
alwayes incite
them to this profession, by
your perswasions, that there
is almost now in your

Churches a greater number
of Virgins, then of marryed
women.
                     By which speach two
things are to be noted, that
Bishops & Prelates, euery
where through the whole
world, did earnestly incite
those that were vnder their
charge to the profession of
Virginity, and that the nū
                        ber
of those who did publikely
professe Virginity,
was as great as those that
were marryed. See S. Ambrose
in his 30. booke of Virgins,
where he sheweth the
same most euidently.
                     
                        
Among these also many
were very eminent and
wealthy, as the daughters
of Senatours, and Princes,
and many of them had
wayting women to follow
them when they went abroad,
as it appeares out of
S. Hierome in his 8. Epistle
to Demetriades, where he also
warneth such Mistresses,
that, as they themselues go
modestly in their apparell,
so they should cause their
women of attendāce also to
auoyd vanity in their attyres,
& see that their habits
were modest and graue.
                     
                        
Besides many Fathers
haue written of the attyre,
and discipline of Virgins,
as Tertullian, S. Cyprian, S. Ambrose,
S. Hierome, in diuers
places of their workes. All
which they directed specially
vnto such, as liuing
out of Monasteryes at their
owne gouernment, imbraced
virginity. And the said
holy Fathers do warne thē
that they should not be seen
in publique without veils,
and ciuilly accompanyed;
that they should not vse secular
ornaments; that they
should abstaine from painting,

and vanity in their
cloathes; that they should
auoyde vnprofitable meetings,
marryages and banquets;
that they should giue
their almes with a pure intention
to the reliefe of orphans,
and such as were in
distresse. All which things
it is manifest do belong to
such as are at their owne
disposing, and retaine their
proper substance.
                     Neither haue we only
examples of Chastity in
single or vnmarryed folkes,
but also euen in those thē
                        selues
which are marryed,

which to auoyd tediousnes
I omit. See Marulus in his 4.
booke the 7. and 8. chap. Fulgosus
in the 4. chap. Ignat. in his 6.
Booke. Out of which it appeares
euidently, that this
institution of imbracing &
professing Chastity, in the
world, hath beene most
frequent and vsuall, euer
since the beginning of the
Church, and therefore very
commendable and meritorious.
                  
                  
                     
                     CHAP. III. The same is witnessed by the testimonyes
of holy Fathers.
                     MERVAILOVS are
the commendations
which holy Fathers giue
to this state of life, which
are no lesse referred to such
as obserue it in the world,
then to those which professe
it in Monasteryes. S.
Ignatius in his epistle ad Tharsenses
calleth Virgins (so vowed
vnto God) the Priests of
Christ, because they offer
their bodyes to God as a sacrifice,
Eas quae in virginitate

degunt &c. Account, saith he,
those who liue in the state
of Virginity, as Priests of
Christ.
                     
                        S. Athanasius in his little
worke of virginity, about
the end, sayth: Magna virtus
continentia &c. Continency
is a great vertue, purity is a
thing worthy to be boasted
of, great are the prayses
of Virgins. O Virginity,
treasure inconsumable, garland
neuer to be withered,
temple of Almighty God,
house of the holy Ghost,
Margarite most pretious,
ouercōmer of death & hell,

life of Angels, crowne of
Saints &c. S. Cyprian in his
booke of the habit and discipline
of Virgins: Nunc nobis ad
Virgines sermo est &c. Now
speake we of Virgins, sayth
he, of whom by how much
their glory is the more eminent,
by so much their care
is the greater. This is the
flower of ecclesiastical bud,
the ornament and grace of
spirituall grace it selfe, the
hopeful towardnes of praise
and honour, a worke entire
and vncorrupted, the image
of God correspondēt
to the sanctimony of our

Lord, the more beautifull
part of Christ his flock &c.
And afterwards: Si praemium
pollicitationis &c. If thou expect
the reward of promise,
thou wilt count thy labour
little: Immortality shall be
giuen to him, that perseuereth;
perpetuall li
                           •
                        e is
proposed a reward; our
Lord promiseth a kingdome:
preserue yee Virgins,
preserue that which you
haue begun to be, preserue
that which yee shall be, for
great is the reward prouided
for you &c.
                     That which wee must

be heereafter, you haue begun
to be already; yee possesse
in present the glory of
the Resurrection in the age
to come; yee passe through
the tymes without taking
infectiō from them as long
as yee perseuere in Chastity
and Virginity; yee are equall
euen to the Angells of
God, solide and vntoucht;
Virginity only endures, onely
lasteth for euer.
                     The first Precept (S. Cypriā
                        
goeth still on) of Almighty
God, commaunded to
increase and generate; the
second perswaded Contynency.

Whilst the world
was rude & vnpeopled, by
our fertility, by generation
we were multiplyed, &
grewe to the increase of
mankind: but now when
the world is peopled and
filled, those who are capable
of Chastity are made
Eunuches spiritually, after
the manner of things that
are made vselesse to the Sex,
for the kingdome of God.
Hitherto S. Cyprian.
                     
                     
                        S. Basill in his booke of
true Virginity saith: Virginity
is certainly a great and
excellent thing, which maketh

a man incorruptible
like vnto God himselfe; but
it passeth not from our bodyes
into our soules; yet
being the propriety of an
incorporeall nature, keeps
also our bodyes incorrupt
with a pretious integrity
&c. Virgins haue before
hand indewed themselues
with that which by deuine
vertue, must be perfected in
vs at the Resurrection; for
liuing heere like vnto Angells,
they neither marry,
nor are marryed, but are
both in vertue of minde, &
integrity of body, equall

vnto Angells. The same Father
explicating also the
words of the Prophet Esay
56. of Eunuches, he wryteth
in this manner. Pro
humano nomine &c. Insteed of
a humane name, sayth our
Lord, I will giue them a
name of Angells which are
immortall, that they may
haue heauen and the fairest
part therof to remaine in,
and that dwelling in the
most beautiful seate of heauen,
that is to say, in my
house, within the inclosurs
thereof, they may receaue
not only the nature of the

Angells, and the honour of
perpetuall succession, being
sufficient of themselues to
continue an eternall succession
of their kind, in themselues,
for life euerlasting;
but also that they may haue
a principall place amongst
Angells, and a name indeleble,
which for the great
splendour in their beauty
shall neuer decay &c.
                     
                        S. Gregory Nazianzen in
his Verses in the prayse of
Virginity singeth thus: Salue
Virginitas &c.
                     
                     Haile Chastity the guift of
only Heauen,
                     
                        
Parent of a purelise, by whom
are giuen
                     Our greatest goods, part euen
of Christ, and one
                     Thats to celestiall spirits companion:
                     Nor euer knew of vnchast bed
the touch,
                     For God himselfe and his faire
Quire are such.
                     S. Iohn Chrysostome in his
booke of Virginity the cap.
2. sayth: Virginity so much
excells marriage, by how
much heauen doth earth,
and Angells mortall men.
And againe in the 12. chap.
Humanity since it is inferiour

to those happy spirits
the Angells, as farre as it is
able, striueth to attaine vnto
their perfection. And
how? Angells marry not,
nor take to them wiues, no
more doth a Virgin. Angels
wayting alwayes about the
throne of Almighty God,
do serne him: so doth a
Virgin. Wherefore S. Paul
calls them away from all
cares, that they may continually
imploy themselues
in the seruice of God, without
hauing wherewithall
to be distracted. Againe,
chap. 37. Dare any one after

all this compare marriage
with virginity, or but once
bring the one in presence
of the other? S. Paul suffereth
not this, who interposeth
a great distance betweene
these two, where he
sayth: the one thinketh on
matters belonging vnto
God, the other on matters
belonging to the world.
                     
                        S. Ambrose in his first booke
of virgins saith, Nec immerito
&c. deseruely hath virginity
deriued from heauen the
manner of her life, since it
is in heauē that her Spouse
hath his dwelling place.

This clowde passing thorough
the Ayre, Skyes, &
Quires of Angells themselues,
hath found out the
word of God, euen in the
bosome of God the Father,
and hath filled its bowells
therwith. For who is it,
that hauing found so great
a good, will leaue it? For
thy Name is an oyntment
powred out, wherfore
yong virgins, and maides
haue loued thee, and taken
thee vnto them. Finally,
that is not my saying, Because
those which neither
are nor wilbe marryed, shall

be as the Angells of God in
heauen.
                     Let none therfore meruaile
(saith S. Ambrose further)
that they are cōpared
to the Angells of God who
are lincked and vnited in
the God of Angells &c. Let
vs compare therfore the cō
                        tents
of marryed women,
with the lowest and least
happines of Virgins.
                     Admit (saith he further)
that some great woman
should boast of her fertility
& the fruit which she hath
brought forth: by how
many the more Children

she hath beene deliuered of,
by so much the greater haue
beene the panges & paynes
which she endured. Let her
reckon the ioy which she
hath of her children, and
withall she may count likewise
the troubles which
they haue caused her. She
marryeth and weepeth: &
what wise vowes are these,
which so sodenly must be
repented &c.
                     Againe▪ Yow haue heard
all yee that are mothers,
in what vertues, in what
order, and discipline, yee
ought to bring vp your

childrē, that you may haue
some of your owne, by
whose merites your owne
sins & offences may be forgiuen.
A Virgin is one to
whom God hath giuen her
to be so, and therefore she is
his guift, she is the reward
of her Parents &c. A virgin
is the oblation of her Mother,
by whose dayly sacrifice
Gods diuine power is
appeased.
                     
                        S. Hierome in his first
book against Iouinian cap. 1.
Ideoplus amat &c. Therefore
our Sauiour Christ loueth
Virgins the more, because

of their owne accord they
giue him that, which was
not exacted of them: and
it is a token of greater grace
to offer that which is not
due, then to giue that
which they are compelled
vnto.
                     And afterward: Grandis
fidei est &c. It is a worke
of great fayth, and much
vertue, when the Temple
of God is most pure to offer
it entierly as a burnt-sacrifice
vnto our Lord, and according
to the Apostle to
be holy, aswell in body as
in spirit.
                     
                        
                        S. Augustine in his booke
of holy Virginity cap. 13.
sayth: Virginall integrity
is an Angelicall portion
and a perpetuall meditation
of incorruptibility in
a corruptible body. Let all
fertility of body giue place
vnto this, and all continency
of marryed persons
yeild vnto it; for the former
is not in our owne
power, the later liueth not
in eternity. The liberty of
our will extendeth not
vnto bodily fruitfullnesse,
Matrimoniall Chastity is
not found in Heauen.

They certainely shall haue
some reward aboue all others
in that generall immortality,
who haue already
growne in their flesh
somwhat that is not fleshly.
Wherefore they are much
ouerseene, who thinke the
good & commodity of this
cōntinency not to be necessary,
for the kingdome of
heauen, but onely for the
present world wherein we
liue.
                     In which last wordes
he conuinceth Iouiniā
                         & the
heretiks of our tymes, who
with him teach, that Virginity

is only conuenient
to auoyd worldly troubles.
                     
                        S. Fulgentius in his 2. Epistle
to Proba cap. 9. Dicimus
à sanctis nuptijs &c. We
affirme (wheras those marry
who cannot liue continent)
that holy Virginity
as farre excelleth holy Matrimony,
as that which is
better excelleth that which
is good, that with is high
excelleth that which is
low, that which is heauenly
excelleth earthly, that
which is holy, more holy,
mortall marriage, marriage
immortall, the flesh the spirit,

weakenes strength, the
fruit of a trāsitory issue the
fruite of a braunch euerlasting,
tribulation security,
vnsetlednes of mind tranquillity,
a good which is
momentary and ful of troubles
excelleth that which is
better, and accompanyed
with ioy euerlasting.
                     These & many other
thinges, holy Fathers haue
written in the cōmendatiō
of virginity, by which the
excellency & worth therof
may be beeter knowen and
esteemed, no one vertue or
estate of life being commē
                        ded

with so great affection,
& consent of holy Fathers,
as this.
                     Heereupon, especially
in former ages, an infinite
multitude haue imbraced
it, in so much that S. Ambrose
in his 3. booke of Virgins
affirmeth, That in the Easterne
& Africā Churches,
there were more virgins
consecrated to Almighty
God, then wee haue men
borne in our parts heere.
And yet notwithstanding
mākind is not therby diminished,
but increased. If
any one (quoth he) imagineth,

that the number of
mankind is diminished by
the multitude of virgins,
let him consider, that where
there are few virgins there
are also the fewer persons,
and where the number of
them is more frequent who
are louers and imbracers of
Virginity, there also the
number of men is more
great. Consider how many
Alexandria, & al the Easterne
parts, with the Churches
also of Affrica, was wont
euery yeare to consecrate:
fewer men are heere begotten
then there virgins consecrated;

the reason wherof
is, that God will not be ouercome
with liberality:
but if the Parents offer him
a Child or two, he renders
them eight or ten, graunting
fruitefullnes, and fortunate
Childe-bearing to
such as are mothers, and
filling their howses with
his blessing. Therfore euen
as faithfull paying of Tythes,
& liberality towards
the poore, bringeth not
pouerty, since God by his
prouidence prospereth and
increaseth our substance, &
maketh our fields the more

fruitfull, as S. Hierome teacheth
Serm. 219. de tempore;
so the loue and affection to
virginity hindreth not the
world, nor wasteth the
number of secular Persons,
but obteyneth it a longer
benediction.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. IIII. The same is proued also, by
reason.
                     THE errour of Iouinian
was, that Virginity
did not excell Marriage,
which he meant by virginity,
taken absolutely and
generally, whether it were

professed by persons liuing
in the world or in Religiō.
He therefore who confesseth
that virginity professed
in the state of Religion, is
to be preferred before Marriage,
but not that which
is imbraced in the world, is
at least halfe a Iouinianist,
because he is halfe of his opinion;
nay rather he seemes
to be altogether of
the same minde, and really
a Iouinianist, because he
denieth, that Virginity is
of it own nature better thē
Marryage, wherein the
whole Errour of Iouinian

about this matter consisted.
For if of it owne proper nature
it were better, it would
followe, that the same being
also professed in the
world, would be better.
See S. Augustine Cap. 28. ad
Quod-vult-Deum, and S. Ierome
in his 10. booke against the
same Iouinian &c.
                     
                     If it were not laudable
and meritorious to vow
Virginity, liuing in the
world, either it should be
for the great difficulty and
morall impossibility of keeping
their vow in that estate,
or els because Chastity

is not better then marriag;
for no other reason can
be imagined. Not the former,
for it is an heresy of
the heretikes of these our
daies, who for the difficulty
therof, affirme, that such a
vow is not to be made, vnlesse
the person know that
he is peculiarly inspired
with the guift of continency.
Not the latter, for it is
the errour of Iouinian aforesaid.
Cōcerning the gift of
Chastity, it is to be held as
a point of faith, that this
gift will not be wanting
to any who will resolue to

liue chaste, if he do as much
as lyeth in him to obteine
the same of Almighty God.
                     If there be so great difficulty
to liue chaste in the
world, in so much that it
is not meritorious for a
man to bind himself therto
by vow; then such a vow is
of it owne nature vayne, &
of no effect to him that makes
it, and so he may freely
breake that which is of
such difficulty, as seemes
morally impossible. But
this kind of reasoning may
by no meanes be admitted;
to wit, that such a vow is

of it owne nature vaine &
of no effect, and that it may
be broken without a most
grieuous sin. See the aboue
mētioned testimony of the
Apostle 1. Tim. 5.
                     It is very commendable
& meritorious for yong
men also remayning in the
world to vow chastity, yea
the Church bindeth al such
as haue taken holy Orders
therunto. Therfore if men
do it, & that it be commendable
in them to do so; why
should it not be the like for
women, such as are yonge,
both Maydes, & Widdows

especially, since men liue in
far greater danger by means
of their greater freedome
of conuersation, and their
lesse bashfullnes, togeather
with more frequent occasions
of temptation. From
whence we see, it proceeds,
that more men which
vow Chastity in the world
do offend against their vow
then women: yea there are
very few of that sexe who
vowing Chastity in the
world do violat their vow:
in so much that oftentimes
in a great citty, for the space
of many yeares, you shall

not hear of any such: which
is a signe, that it is a matter
more easy for women to do
then for men; & yet we see
that men do laudably take
vpon them such vowes:
neither can they by any
meanes be excused frō thē,
being once vndertaken.
                     If it be meritorious to
keep Virginity in Religion,
why is it not also in the
World? For the circumstance
of the place alters not the
merit of the worke, but the
excellency it selfe thereof,
and a deuout will vnto it:
and this pious inclination

may be had as well out of
the state of Religion, when
a Virgin purposeth with
her selfe to abstaine from
Marriage, and to consecrate
her virginity to Almighty
God, that she may serue him
the more perfectly, that she
may follow the counsell of
our Sauiour Christ, that she
may imitate our Lord, and
his most blessed Mother,
that she may apply all her
thoughts and affections to
heauenly things, and to the
health of her soule; for the
excellency of the worke is
equall on both sides. Therfore

there is no reason, why
the profession of Chastity
in the World, should not be
meritorious, as well as in
Religion.
                     It is not only commendable
in Monasteryes, but
also in the world, to do other
good workes, as to
pray, to fast, to giue corporall
and spirituall almes,
to chastice our body, and to
bind our selues by vow
thereunto. Then if other
good works loose not their
worth & esteem, nor their
merit before God by being
done in the world; why

should Virginity, and single
life? Yea, as it is the more
prayse-worthyto be temperate,
and to abstaine sitting
at a banquet, and to be able
to bridle our appetite, euen
in the very middest of prouocations;
so likewise may
it be a deed of greater merit
to liue chastly in the world,
where occasions of falling
are more frequent: As for
example, when there are
lawfull reasons why such
occasions might not be cō
                        ueniently
shunned, which
otherwise they would haue
willingly auoyded.
                     
                        
The state of being Religious,
and to be shut vp in
Monasteryes, is not agreeable
with the complexion
of euery one: yea a great
many, either are not apt for
this state, by reason of the
weakenes of their body, or
for other causes, or oftentymes
their mindes are not
easely wonne to it, and that
most commonly for diuers
sufficient reasons, which
it is not necessary to reueale:
and who now should
cōstraine such to marry, or
to enter into Monasteryes?
Why should it not be lawfull

for them to keepe their
virginity in the world, &
to vow themselues vnto it?
Is it either because they wil
not, nor cannot ascend to
the highest degree, that they
must be therfore constrayned
to stay in the lowest, &
may not keep a meane betwixt
both? No man will
thinke so, except he be indued
with the spirit of Iouiuian.
The counsells and aduices
of our Sauiour Christ
are not so necessarely vnited
one to the other, but
that one may be followed
without another, and by

themselues, in diuers degrees.
Wherfore as those
who desire to obserue the
state of Pouerty, are not
bound vnto Chastity; so
also those which imbrace
Chastity, must not therfore
of necessity keep Pouerty,
or Obedience, or shut themselues
vp in Monasteryes.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. V. The same is proued out of the commodities
which this state of
life, being prosessed, both in
the world and in Religion,
doth bring with it.
                     THe Cause why this
state of life is so commended

by holy Fathers,
as well in the one as the
other, are the manifold
cōmodities which it bringeth
therwith. For in both,
it is an imitation of Angelicall
life; in both it is the
making of our body as it
were a burnt-offering to
Almighty God; in both it
is a spirituall Marriage, in
which Christ is the spouse;
in both it freeth from the
irksome slauery of Marriage,
and from the troubles
which belonge vnto it;
in both it deliuereth the
minde from infinite cares

& troubles; finally in both
it maketh it free, and at liberty
to apply it selfe vnto
God, and to dwel as it were
mentally and spiritually
with the Blessed, in community
of heauenly things.
                     First it is an imitation
of Angelicall life, as holy
Fathers euery where do deliuer,
out of the opinion of
our Lord Matt. 22. Because
as Angells marry not, nor
are troubled with carnall
concupiscence, but are euer
attent to diuine matters, &
entertaine themselues alwayes
in them; so in like

manner Virgins are sayd to
anticipate the glory of the
Resurrection, because marriage
after the Resurrection
shall cease.
                     Virginity is a burnt-offering:
for as in a burnt offring
the thing sacrificed is
killed, and afterward all of
it consumed in the honour
of God, that no part therof
remaines for humaine
vse: so likewise a Virgin
must first kill all carnall affectiōs
in her selfe, & afterwardes
offer vp her body,
mortified after this sort by
the fire of Charity, to Almighty

God, and reserue
no part thereof to any humaine
or carnall vse.
                     She is a spirituall marriage,
because by vow she is
bound vnto God as to her
husband: for as the band of
carnall marriage is not to
be loosed; neither also is
that of spirituall: yea that
of spirituall Marriage, is
much more indissoluble;
for it cannot be loosed by
death it selfe, but continueth
in all eternity. Againe,
as carnall marriage is effected
for the mutuall enioying
and comfort of both

persons, and the bringing
forth of children: so this
Marriage is made, that the
soule may please God the
better, and receaue help &
comfort backe againe from
him, and that it may conuerse
more familiarly, and
with the greater delight
with Almighty God, as
with its Spouse.
                     And finally, to the end
that hauing receaued seed
of diuine grace from him,
an immortall and glorious
issue may be begotten to inherit
in the world to come:
wherein spiritual Marriage

is farre more happy then
carnall; for the later is to
the end, that of impure and
corruptible seede, another
man may be begotten, and
that but to enioy a mortall
life, and thereby subiect to
infinite miseryes: but the
other is to the end, that out
of diuin seed a mortall man
should beget, not another
mortall man, but himselfe,
to an immortall and happy
life. Therefore he perswadeth
himselfe first vnto this
marriage, and afterward by
word & example profiteth
others. To this may be likwise

added, that as in carnall
marriage, titles, and
dignityes, and all the goods
of either is communicated
to both: so likewise in spirituall,
the goods and dignityes
of the espoused, belongeth
also to the Spouse.
                     The desire of a wife
is, that she may haue a husband,
who is faire, noble,
rich, powerfull, and courteous,
and if it happen that
she get such a one, she thinketh
her selfe happy. But
how much more happy, is
a Virgin whose husband is
the most fayrest, most noble,

most rich, most powerfull,
most gentle, and immortal
Lord of heauen and
earth, of Angells also, and
of men. See more of this in
S. Ambrose in his first booke
of Virgins.
                     For as much as belongs
to the benefits and commodityes
of holy Virginity,
they are generally three.
The first is, that it freeth
the mind from innumerable
troubles and afflictions
vnto which the state of matrimony
either by meanes
of the wife or by meanes of
the childrē is subiect vnto;

which the Apostle insinuateth
1. Cor. 1. when he
speaketh in this manner of
those which are marryed:
Tribulationem carnis habebunt
huiusmodi; such shal haue the
tribulation of the flesh.
And first of all, is the seruitude
of the wife, by reason
that she hath not power of
her owne body, & is made
subiect in all thinges to her
husband, must endure his
frowardnes, his insolencies,
his banquetting, drūkenes,
iealousy, suspicion, incontinency,
adultery, taunts, &
blowes. Also she must follow

him, sticke alwayes to
him, obey him and serue
him as his slaue; so that
many slaues in the world
haue a more tollerable bō
                        dage,
then some wiues vnhappily
marryed; whilst he
spends her wealth and substance
at dice, at play, in
drinking, banquetting, prodigall
giuing, improfitable
bargaines, improuident cō
                        tentions,
and diuers other
wayes, which his wife is
not able to remedy.
                     Moreouer he leaueth
the charge of prouiding for
the whole house-hould to

her, and yet alloweth not
wher withall sufficiently to
do it; and bringeth her oftentymes
euen into that extremity,
that she groweth
halfe desperate. In the mean
tyme being oppressed and
ouercome with too much
impatience, she often curseth
her husband, and wisheth
al il hap to befal him,
and desireth nothing more
then his death. Neither are
these thinges rare and seldome,
but the whole world
is full of them.
                     Now if we should add
vnto all this, the troubles

that come continually by
meanes of children, there
would arise euen a whole
world of miseryes & afflictions.
And although in
the carnall Act of marriage
there seemeth to be now &
then a little pleasure: yet of
it owne nature, it is both
vncleane (as a thing wherin
we differ not frō a beast)
and also full of shame and
immodesty; & in a moment
it is past, and afterward rewarded
with innumerable
discommodityes. For presently
after Conception,
there followeth a kind of

irkesomnes, idle dreames,
giddines, vnsetlednes of the
head, melancoly, conuulsions
of the hart-stringes, absurd
longings after meates,
and a generall perturbation
of nature.
                     Then follow the paines
of child-bearing which are
both violent to the sense,
& oftentymes endure long,
and to many bring death
also; and then the Child being
borne, with what great
care and solicitude must
it be brought vp, vntill it
come to be of some strength
and perfection of nature.

How many tymes a day
must it be made cleane,
fed, made vp, apparrelled,
laid to sleepe, rockt in the
cradell, taken out againe to
giue it suck, and be held
out. How many times must
it be flattered and intreated
with faire speaches & with
a thousand pretty hypocrisies
and flatterings, to make
it leaue crying, or to sleepe?
                     These are the contynuall
exercises of such as be
Mothers, and in such they
are imployed, not on ly all
day long, but also most part
of the night, so that they

can scarce take any rest but
with often interruption.
                     I omit the sluttishnes,
the ill sauour, the weeping,
crying, & brauling, which
they are constreyned dayly
to suffer. I omit allso the
cares and troubles, which
they haue when their children
begin to grow big, &
to be exposed to diuers chā
                        ces
of the world. What
great greefe they haue, if it
chaunce they should miscarry
and dye; if by euil
company they should be allured
to villany and dishonesty;
if they should proue

stubborne and disobedient
against their Parents; if they
should spend & wast their
Parents goodes at play,
drinking, or at any other
vnlawful game; if without
their Parents consent they
should marry.
                     To these afflictions the
whole life of all such as are
mothers, is always subiect;
for albeit the Parents be
very deuout and religious,
yet it happens oftentymes
that the children be wicked
and lewd, and with their
misdemeanours, and ill liuing,
torment their Parēts,

as wee haue examples in
Adam and Cain, in Noë and
Cham, in Abraham and Ismael,
in Isaac and Esau, in Iacob
and many of his sonnes, in
Dauid, Amon, and Absolom,
with infinite others: therfore
since sacred virginity
deliuers from all this, it is
deseruedly to be numbred
amongst the greatest benefitts
that are.
                     Another commodity of
virginity and single life is,
that it freeth the minde frō
all cares of gouerning a family,
of increasing the
stocke and wealth of their

estate, of marrying their
children, & of leauing them
ample Patrimonyes; for of
these foure things all Parents
are for the most part
most careful & sollicitous;
yea commōly their minds
are so wholly addicted and
giuen to such businesses, as
they can scarce euer thinke
seriously on God, or things
belonging to the good of
their soule.
                     These things they keep
alwayes in minde, in these
things they spend all their
thoughts and affections,
these things so waste and

weare out all the ability &
powers of their mindes, as
they haue no strength left
to consider, or thinke vpon
things that are eternall.
                     Greatly therfore is the
misery of this estate to be
pittyed; for the bondage of
the mynd is more hurtfull
a great deale, then that of
the body; and the losse of
good thoughts, is a greater
domage, then the losse of
money.
                     The third cōmodity of
virginity and single life is,
that it maketh the minde,
being freed from the cares

and troubles of Marriage,
more fit & prepared to serue
Almighty God, and procure
its owne safety: and
this is the greatest good of
this life. For which cause it
is commended specially by
the Apostle the 1. Cor. 7.
where he saith, Mulier innupta
&c. A womā vnmarryed,
and a Virgin thinketh on
what belongeth vnto God,
that she may be holy, both
in body and minde.
                     There is nothing better
nor more healthfull vnto
our soule thē to serue God,
and to endeauour the obteyning

of our soules wellfare.
To this purpose were
we made, & adorned with
these noble faculties of our
soule, Vnderstanding, Memory,
and Will. Wee haue
not receiued these to imploy
them about transitory and
seruile matters, without any
fruit at al, but to addresse
them to eternall and celestiall
things, for our great benifit
and aduantage. All
earthly things are to base &
cōtemptible for our minds
(which is aboue all visible
things) to fixe, and exercise
it selfe there about. The

shortnes it selfe of our life,
togeather with the vncertinty
& necessity of dying,
might iustly recall vs from
the care of temporall matters,
& addresse our thoghts
to the solicitude of thinges
eternall. Whereupon the
Apostle 1. Cor. 7. sayth: Tē
                           pus
breue est &c. Time is short,
it remaines, that such as
haue wiues, be as those who
haue them not; and those
who mourne, like those
who mourne not; & those
who reioyce, like those
who reioyce not; and those
who buy, like those who

possesse not; and those who
vse this world, like those
who vse it not; for the fashion
of this world passeth
away &c.
                     By which wordes he
teacheth vs, that we should
be no more affected and addicted
to transitory things,
then as if they did not belong
vnto vs. We ought to
haue care of nothing so
much, as to auoyd eternall
punishment, and attaine
to euerlasting ioyes: for in
comparison of these, all the
good or ill of this world,
ought to be of no ac
                           •
                        ount:

So that if there were nothing
but madnes practised
in the world, this would
be the greatest, to neglect
the highest and euerlasting
thinges, & to follow that
which is base and transitory,
with so great hazard of
eternall damnation.
                     Therfore as that manner
of life is miserable, and
to be auoyded by all wise
men, which intangleth the
mind with care of base &
earthly thinges, howsoeuer
glorious and honourable
they seeme: So on the contrary,
is that state happy &

most desirously to be imbraced,
which freeth the mind
from all these cares & troubles,
and affoardeth it commodity
to meditate on heauenly
things, and to apply
it selfe to the obtayning of
its own welfare. And such
is single life, as it hath byn
shewed.
                     Neither in women only,
but also in men single
life hath all these effectes:
for most of those thinges
which we haue sayd before
of women, haue place also
in men: yet men in Marriage
are most commonly exposed

to more discommodityes
and inconueniences
then women, because the
whole care of maintayning
the houshould, and of the
greatest busines lyeth vpon
him; and infinite disdaines
of the wife, offences, iealosies,
suspicions, cōplaints,
and frowardnes are to be
endured, as S. Hierome prosecuteth
it, very elegantly
out of Theophrastus the Philosopher
in his first booke
against Iouinianus, whose
words it seemeth heer good
to set downe.
                     
                        Fertur, inquit, Aureolus &c.
                        
Heer is brought (quoth he)
a little goulden booke of
Theophrastus written concerning
marriage, in which
he asketh this question,
Whether a wise man should
marry a wife or no? And
when he hath defined, that
if she were fair, wel broght
vp, of good Parents, and if
she were healthfull & rich,
with these conditions a
wise man might somtimes
marry; he presently inferreth:
But all these seldome
match togeather in marriage,
therfore it is not behoofull
for a wise man to marry

&c. And then he sets
down diuers reasons which
the same Philosopher alledgeth
for his opinion.
                     First (quoth he) it
hinders the study of Philosophy;
for no man can serue
his bookes and his wife at
once. There are also many
thinges which are necessary
for the vse of Wiues, as
gay apparell gold, Iewells
expenses, wayting women,
variety of houshold stuffe,
guilded horse-litters, and
coaches. Moreouer you shal
haue all the night long nothing
but pratling, & complaintes

that this Dame
weares better cloaths when
she goes abroad then she:
This Lady, or Gentle woman
is much honoured and
respected of all wheresoeuer
she comes; whilest I,
poore soule, am despised &
contemned of euery body.
Why did you looke so earnestly
on my Neighbours
wife? Why did you talke
with her mayd? Are you
come frō the Market, what
haue yee bought? &c.
                     Her husband cannot haue
a friend or companiō, but
straight she thinketh that

the loue of another is her
hatred. If there were a learned
Maister in euery town,
men should neither forsake
their wiues, nor be able to
walke with so great a burthen.
If she be poore, it is
cost to help her, if rich, a
torment to endure her.
                     Moreouer there is no
choice of a wife, but what
a one soeuer you chance
to take, if she be colerique,
if a foole, if deformed, if
proud, if slutrish, what fault
soeuer she hath, we learne
that afterward. A Horse,
an Asse, an Oxe, a Dog, the

worst slaue a man can entertaine;
his apparell also,
his kettles, his chayres, his
cups, his earthen pots, all
these a man may proue before
he buy them, only his
wife must not be shewed
before she be had, for feare a
man should so dislike her,
that he would neuer haue
her.
                     You must alwayes be
looking on her face, and
commending her beauty,
for feare least if you looke
on another, she thinke that
her beauty displeaseth you.
She must be called Mistresse

and her Birth-day must be
made a Holy day: you must
sweare by her health, and
you must pray that she may
out liue you: you must reuerence
her that nurst her,
and her also that bare her
when she was a little one,
her seruant, her brother-in-law,
her little dandling,
her pretty Page, her hyred
Proour, and her Eunuch
forsooth, for the longer continuance
and more security
of lust (vnder all which
names are prettily couched
Adulterers.) And whomesoeuer
of all these she affectcteth,

he must be beloued
too, euen by those to whom
they are vngratefull.
                     If you commit the gouernement
of the whole
house to her charge, you
must be her seruant. If you
reserue any part of it to
your selfe, she thinks you
wil not trust her, & straight
turneth into hatred, and
scoulding, and vnles you
beware of her betymes, you
are in danger to be poysoned.
                     Old women, Wisards,
brokers of Iewels and silke
apparel, if you admit any of

these into your house, you
are in dāger of cuckolding:
and if you forbid them,
you do her wronge to suspect
her.
                     But to what end is it
to watch her narrowly,
when a wife that is vnchast
can neuer be restrained: &
if she be chast, she ought not
to be restayned; for the constraint
of chastity is but an
vnfaythfull keeper. She only
is truly to be named chast
who can be otherwise if she
wil. A faire wife is a bayte,
aswell in other mens eyes,
as in his that hath her. A

slut wil sooner desire others
then they her. It is a hard
matter to enioy that alone
which many men seeke after;
and it would be a trouble
to haue such a one, as
no body would vouchsafe
to affect. Yet it is a lesse misery
to haue an ill fauoured
wife, then to keepe a faire
one true. There is nothing
safely possest by one, which
of euery body is wisht for.
                     One sollicits with his
comlynes, another with his
wit, another with his pleasantnes,
another with his
money: by some meanes or

other at last the Fort will be
taken, which is on euery
side so strongely beseiged.
                     But it may be obiected,
that it is necessary for a mā
to haue a wife, to take
charge of the expēses of his
howse, or to be a comfort
to him when he languisheth,
or to auoyd solitarynes.
To this I answere, that
a faithfull seruant obeying
the authority of his Maister,
and doing his busines according
to his will, disposeth
of matters a great deale
better then a wife, who
thinketh that her Mistresship

cōsisteth in doing that
which is against 
                           •
                        er husbands
will, that is to say,
to do that which she hath a
will to, not that which she
is commaunded to do.
                     And as for attending &
comforting a man when he
is sicke, his friends and seruants,
or such poore soules
as he hath made beholding
vnto him, may better do it
then she, who vpbraides
him, as it were, with the
teares which shee sheedes
for him, yea sells the very
filth and drosse therof, in
hope to be his executour.

And by this boasting of her
carefullnes, neuer leaues
him, til with her perpetual
trouble, she driues him into
vtter desperation.
                     But if her finger chance
to ake, he must be sicke for
it, and neuer budge from
her bed side. Or if she be a
good wife, and of a sweete
disposition (which notwithstanding
is a rare bird)
he must groane with her,
whilst she is in child bed, &
be payned with her danger.
                     As for the auoyding of
solitarines, a wise man can

neuer be alone; he hath present
all those which are,
or euer were good, in his
thoughts, & freely placeth
his mind on what he will.
That which he cannot do
with his body, he imbraceth
with his thoughts, &
if there be sarcity of men to
conuerse withal, he talketh
with God; he is neuerlesse
alone then when he wants
all company.
                     Besides it is a most idle
thing to take a wife, in regard
to haue children by
her that his family may not
be extinct, or that he haue,

help & ayde to his old age,
and also to know who shall
in herit that which he leaues
behind. For what is
one the better when he is
going out of the world,
that another is called by his
name, when as a sonne cannot
presently be like his Father;
and there are an infifinite
number of other men
also perhaps called by the
same name. Or what booteth
it to nourish those at
hom, whō we hope may be
helps to vs whē we are old,
whē perhaps they either dy
before vs, or become of such

a peruerse disposition, as
they will not succour vs; or
if they themselues come to
maturity of yeares, perhaps
they thinke their parents
liue to longe.
                     And as for heires, our
friends & our neighbours
whom we loue, are better &
more sure heyres vnto vs,
being chosen thereunto by
vs freely, thē those whome
wee are constreyned to
haue whether we will or
no: though indeed it be a
for more assured inheritance
to make our selues our
owne heires, (by doyng

good workes whilst we
liue, (for otherwise we do
but abuse the same) then to
leaue it, being gotten all
by our owne industry and
pains, to the vncertein vses
of any others whatsoeuer.
                     These reasons and the
like Theophrastus discussing,
what good Christiā might
he not make ashamed of
such vanities and troubles,
whose conuersation ought
to be in heauen, and who
dayly sayth Cupio dissolui &c.
I desire to be dissolued and
be with Christ: as though
he who may be a coheyre

with Christ himself, should
desire to haue man to be
his heire, and should wish
for children, and be delighted
in the succession of
his posterity whome perhaps
Antichrist shall peruert;
when notwithstanding
wee read that Moyses,
and Samuel preferred others
before their own children.
Neither yet did they account
thē children whome
they sawe displease Almighty
God.
                     Thus farre are S. Hieromes
words, who afterward
confirmeth the same with

examples out of the old
Testament. By which it is
manifestly shewed how far
single life in the world is to
be preferred aboue Marriage,
and out of how many
discommodityes & cares it
doth deliuer a man; and
what aboundance of helpe
it affoardeth to a man, to
passe ouer pleasantly, and
quietly this temporall life,
and obteine a high degre in
the euerlasting. All which
things if they should be
exactly weighed and considered
of most men, I doubt
not, but there would be

farre fewer who would so
much admire, loue, and
imbrace the seruitude, that
Marryage oftentimes bringeth
with it.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. VI. Of the Merits of both States of
life, to wit, of vnmarried
and married.
                     SOME one will obiect,
That if the paines and
troubls of mothers be great
in bearing and breeding
their children, and in supporting
the conditions and
iniuryes of their husbands;
great also are the merits of

enduring them: which
merits such as are virgins
cannot haue. Whence the
Apostle also 1. Tim 2. saith:
Saluabitur &c. She shall be
saued, by bringing forth
children &c.
                     I answere, that Parents
may be moued with a double
affection, to beget and
bring vp children: to wit,
with a meere humaine and
naturall affection, & with
a spirituall or diuine. A naturall
affection is, when
any one desireth children
for the conseruation of his
name & family that he may

haue heires to whome he
may leaue his goods; that
he may out-liue his owne
death in his posterity; that
he may be honoured in thē;
that he may haue comfort
and help by his children.
All these are humaine respects
and affections, and
therfore of no merit, or esteeme
before God; yet of
their owne nature they are
not ill, but indifferent.
Wherfore those who out of
such affection do contract
Marriage, or beget childrē,
or bring them vp begotten,
merit nothing before Almighty

God, and loose all
their labours and charges
which they are at, as far
forth as this; to wit, that
they shall not receiue eternall
reward for them, but
onely a temporall comfort
or comodity. For as an humaine
affection is not meritorious
before Almighty
God, no more also is the
work which followeth out
of it, although it be frequēt
and laborious.
                     In like manner to loue
and follow Honours, Riches,
Magistracy, Dignityes
and Pleasures for the

commodity, splendor and
sweetnes which we perceiue
in them, although of
it selfe it be no sinne; neither
likewise is it of any desert,
but rather apperteineth
to the delight of such things
as are the concupiscence of
the flesh, of the eyes, and
pride of life, and which proceede
out of a corrupt nature,
not out of the inspiratiō
of diuine grace.
                     The same likewise is
to be sayd of the affections
of Parents, whereby they
wish and procure these cō
                        tents
& pleasures vnto their

children. For euen as whē
they desire and obtayne
these things for themselues,
they deserue nothing at the
handes of Almighty God;
no more likewise doe they
when they doe the like in
their childrens behalfe: yea
this affection is not onely
not meritorious before Almighty
God, but also it is
not so much as a worke of
any vertue.
                     For first of all, that it
not a worke proceeding
out of any diuine or infused
vertue, it is manifest, since
it may be foūd also in Heathens

themselues, and the
most wicked persons that
liue. Also that such affections
proceed not out of any
morall or Philosophicall
vertue it is plaine, for they
respect not their obiects,
as they are honest and reasonable,
as the natures of
such vertues require, but as
they are delightfull & cō
                        modious,
or honourable.
                     Whence it is, that no man
by such an affection becommeth
praise worthy, which
is the propriety of vertue.
As no man is worthy of
prayse, for that he loueth or

getteth riches, honors, plea,
sures, or for louing his child
because he is fair, or because
he is like him, for singing
wel, dancing wel, speaking
well, or being indewed
with such like ciuill ornaments
or qualityes. Al such
affections are only naturall
and indifferent, and therefore
of no desert or merit in
the sight of Almighty God
before his Tribunall seate.
                     Therfore as he which
giueth almes to the poore
prodigally, and vaynegloriously
to make himself honoured
and esteemed the

more of men, according to
the wordes of our Sauiour,
shal haue no reward before
Almighty God, but receaueth
all his reward in the
prayses which he getteth of
men in so doing: So those,
which marry for respect of
pleasure or riches, those
which desire to haue children,
or to bring them vp
to haue contentment, who
day and night onely take
care, how they may leaue
them a large and ample inheritance,
that they may
promote them to honours,
offices, dignityes, or wealthy

marriages, deserue nothing
before God, but receaue
their reward in the
temporall contentements,
which by this meanes they
procure, either to themselues,
or to their children.
                     Therefore to speake
truely, their labours and
cares are all lost; neither do
they reape any fruit at all
to be accounted of from all
this; for nothing is to be esteemed
of any great valew,
but that which is euerlasting.
                     All temporall things
are of small account, passing

away as shaddows, & therfore
most vnworthy to
spend al the vigour & principal
acts of our soule about
thē, which were ordained
for things eternal. Heerupō
holy Scripture euery where
calleth vs from the loue and
desire of riches, honours,
and pleasures, and telleth
vs that such as are poore,
meeke & oppressed, are only
happy.
                     Neither are all these labours
and paines of Parents
onely vnprofitable, but they
are also hurtfull, and the
originall cause of infinite

euils. From hence it is, that
there are such an infinite
nūber of men in the world,
who damne there owne
soules (which otherwise
might haue been saued) for
their childrens sake, to mak
them rich, or to promote
them to Honours. For those
that wil become rich as the
Apostle witnesseth, fall into
temptation, and the snare of the
deuill, and into many vnprofitable
and hurtfull desires, which send
them head long into damnatiō, &
destruction; for couetous desire is
the roote of all mischeife.
                     
                     Marriage doth comonly

force men headlong vnto
this desire, for al mē would
make their children rich, &
leaue them a large inheritance;
so that deseruedly
also for that cause, that state
of life is not to be greatly
desired, which maketh all
our paines and cares, most
commonly, not only vnprofitable
for our welfare,
but also dangerous and
hurtfull vnto vs, if it be not
auoyded. Yet it followes
not from hence, that wedlocke
is euill: for neither
Riches or Honnors be euil
but good, which God also

sometymes bestoweth vpō
vs, for the reward of some
good deed or other; and in
tymes past haue beene promised
also to those few
who obserued the law: but
it is dangerous I say, to loue
such pleasures and delights,
to follow them, and to imploy
al our endeauors onely
in attayning of them, since
they are but base & meane,
and do hinder the loue and
desire of things eternall, &
intāgle the minde in many
snares.
                     In like manner, though
Matrimony of it selfe be

good, and ordeyned by
God, yet it drawes with it
many cares and troubles,
which through humanie
frailty hinder the health
of the soule, that it leades
men secretly into many
sins, and oftentimes vnto
eternall damnation. Thus
much of the humaine affectiō,
out of which many
men inclyne vnto Marryage.
                     The spirituall affection
is, when Parents desire to
haue children, to the end
that they may instruct them
in the feare of God, that

they may teach them to
serue him, that they may
increase the number of the
faithful, that by them many
deeds of deuotion may be
done, that God may be honored
by them and the like:
these affections rise not
out of nature; but out of diu
                           •
                        ne
inspiration, and are
worthy of a man, as he is a
Christian.
                     Whence I confesse that
Parents who with this kind
of affection desire to haue
yssue, and bring them vp,
as aforsaid, do merit greatly
before Almighty God;

& the wife also who with
such a spirit desireth Marriage,
shalbe saued by the
bearing of children. And
in this manner the wordes
of the Apostle are to be vnderstood
1. Tim. 2. But yet
it seemes to be more probable,
that the Apostle in that
place speaketh not of the
merit, but of the estate and
office of Marriage; & that to
be also the meaning of this
saying, Saluabitur &c. She
shalbe saued, by doing the
office of Marryage, and endeauouring
to haue children:
for so the Greeke text

doth import, as the learned
do teach.
                     So likewise to the Romans
cap. 4. 5. & 11. Abrahā
                        
is sayd to be the Father of
those that belieue, by hauing
the foreskin or Prepuce cut
off, that is to say, by those
which are in that Estate.
And in 2. Cor. cap. 6. Per
gloriam & ignobilitatem &c. By
glory and ignobility, by infamy
and good credit, that
is to say, in prosperity and
aduersity. The same is confirmed
by the words which
the Apostle addeth, Saluabitur
&c. She shal be saued (saith

he) by the bearing of childrē,
if she perseuere in faith,
in loue, & in holynes, with
sobriety: therefore he attributeth
the cause of saluatito
fayth, & to loue &c. not
to the procreation of children:
yet I confesse also that
this very deed is meritorious
likewise, if it be done,
as we haue sayd, out of
spirituall affection: but it is
otherwise, if it be done out
of humaine only.
                     Moreouer if this estate
and the offices thereof, be
chosen & performed with
a spirituall affection: neuertheles

single life is much
better and more meritorious;
both because it remoues
innumerable occasions
of distractions, imperfections,
and sinnes, by which
the estate of Matrimony is
hindred in the offices of
deuotion; and also because
it affoardeth cōmodity of
conuersing dayly with God
and of being attent to diuin
matters. Wherefore a Virgin
oftentymes may merit
more in one day, then a
marryed woman in many
monethes.
                  
                  
                     
                     CHAP. VII. Of certaine thinges to be obserued
in this Estate.
                     TO the end that Virgins
may the better
preserue this treasure, & obtayne
their scope and purpose
more at larg, by which
they haue so straitly bound
themselues vnto God, and
vndertaken this estate; holy
Fathers haue prescribed
certaine things to be obserued.
First in their apparell;
secondly in their exercises;
thidly in the vse of their riches
and wealth; & lastly

in their conuersation.
                     As for their apparell,
it must not be costly, but
dec
                           •
                        nt and graue, without
any kind of vanity or curiosity,
without pride also, or
any secular ornaments, such
as may represent the state
wherein they liue, and the
forsaking of the world: by
which euery man that sees
them, may know that they
are Virgins, and haue an
intent neuer to marry. For
by this meanes they shall auoyd
all importunityes and
troubles, which suiters are
accustomed to vse: and besides

this they shall preuent
many other inticements to
the breach of their intent.
                     
                        S. Cyprian in his booke
de disciplina & habitu Virginum,
handleth this place more at
large, and with great elegancy:
Continency (quoth
he) & Chastity consist not
only in the integrity of the
body, but also in the honor
of the Attire and apparell,
being ioyned with modesty▪
She must not only be a
Virgin really, but also she
must be knowne, and be
belieued to be such a one:
so that no man who seeth

her who is a Virgin, may
haue any doubt whether
she be so or no. For why
should she go adorned, or
attyred as though she had,
or would haue a husband?
let her rather feare to please
any, if she be a Virgin; neither
let her seeke her owne
danger, since she preserues
her selfe for a better & more
deuout purpose &c. Neither
ought a Virgin to be
delighted with the shew of
her owne beauty, or to take
a glory in her owne person
or comlynes, since she hath
no resistance or war against

any thing, so much, as against
the flesh, nor any
more obstinate enemy to ouercom
thē her own body.
                     Afterwards he alleadgeth
some, who excuse thē
                        selues
for their Riches and
Nobility, for which respects
they thinke that it is
conuenient for them to go
more richly attyred; whose
excuse he refuteth at large,
shewing in what thinges
they should imploy their
wealth.
                     To their habit also belongeth
a Veyle, with the
which it is meete that a

Virgin should be couered
when she goeth abroad,
least either she might see
that which were not befitting,
or her countenance
should be perceaued of others.
For how many, I
pray you, haue there beene
in the world, who only by
sight haue either perished
themselues, or killed others?
In so much that they must
take principal heed of their
eyes. And Tertullian hath
written a particuler Treatise
vpō this subiect of virgins
veyling and couering
their heads, which he iudged

to be a thing so necessary,
that he sayd: It was no
lesse then a passion of lust,
to a vertuous Virgin, euery
tyme that she exposeth her
selfe to publique view; to
wit, because that therby she
with her face open, casting
her eyes freely about to see,
& to be seene, is easily corrupted
in spirit; & that the
very gazing it self is a signe
of an vnchast mind.
                     And againe afterward:
The desire not to be veyled
or couered is not a chast desire,
but admiteth somwhat
that belongeth not vnto a

Virgin; as also the desire to
delight others inbeholding
her; for true, entyre, and
pure Virginity feareth nothing
so much, as it owne
selfe, yea it endureth not the
eyes of other women that
delight in gazing, since the
eyes of it selfe are farre different
from such; it flyeth
to the veyle of her head, as
to a helmet, & as to a buckler
which defendeth her; it
is a protection against the
blowes of temptation, against
the darts of scandals,
against suspitions, & whispering,
and emulation, yea

and against Enuy it selfe.
After this put on the armor
of bashfullnes, entrench thy
selfe within the bull warke
of modesty, build vp a wall
for thy sex, which keepeth
in thyne own eyes, and letteth
not the eyes of others
to enter. Thou hast marryed
Christ and deliuered thy
body to him, thou hast espoused
the maturity of thy
yeares to him. Goe according
to his will and pleasure;
it is Christ that biddeth
those who are marryed
to others▪ to veile themselues,
much more those

which are espoused vnto
him.
                     For this purpose the
womens attyres of Brabant
are very fit, which are called
by them Huekes, which
the very noblest Matrons
of that Country vse, when
they would not be knowne
in any publike assembly.
                     Let vs now come to the
exercises which holy Fathers
prescribe to be vsed
by virgins. These are fasting,
prayer, reading of spirituall
bookes, and handyworke,
in the dayly vse and
variety wherof they may

spend all their tyme most
profitably.
                     Fasting is as it were the
foundation & ground of al
other vertues; for by this
the roote of many temptations,
and by consequence
of many vices, is cut of; the
minde is made more fit to
conuerse dayly with Almighty
God, with great comfort
& fruit, from whome
it conceiueth all its good,
frō whence al Saints for the
most part haue deriued the
begining of a spiritual life.
By fasting, I meane not such
fasting, as should weaken

or impaire nature: but such
wherby the body becomes
more healthfull, the mind
more quicke, and the concupiscence
more subiect.
                     S. Hierome commendeth
greatly this exercise in his
8. Epistle to Demetriades, de
custodia virginit. After (saith
he) diligent taking heed
of impure thoughts, you
must put on the ornament
of fasting, and sing with
Dauid, I haue humbled my
soule in fasting, &c. And
then afterwardes. Fasting
is not a perfect ve
                           •
                        tue of it
selfe, but the foundation of

others, and is both sanctification
& chastity, without
which no man shall
euer see God. It affoardeth
staires to such as wil ascend
to the top; & yet if it should
be alone, it is not sufficient
to crowne a virgins &c.
                     In which words it is to
be noted, that fasting is tearmed
by S. Hierome, Sanctification,
and Chastity of other
vertues. It is called
Sanctification, because it
maketh others vertues florish,
and works their effects
the better; and by this meanes
it sanctifieth.
                     
                        
It is called Chastity, becanse
it procureth cleanesse
of body and hart, wherin
consist all other vertues,
without which no man
shall see God.
                     And that this fasting must
be moderate, & such as may
not weaken the body, but
refresh & quickē the mind,
S. Ierome warneth vs in these
words, when he saith: Neither
do I prescribe to yow
immoderate fasting, or such
abstinences, as should be
altogether without meat,
by which bodyes that are
tender and delicate may be

quickly brought out of health,
and grow sicke, before
they haue layde the
foundation of this holy
conuersation.
                     
                        S. Ambrose in his first book
of virgins saith, that the
sparing of meate, and abstinence
from drinke, maketh
a man to be ignorant
of vice; for it maketh him
to be ignorant of the causes
therof. Therfore let this be
rather a fast of sobriety thē
affliction.
                     Prayer also, vnder which
is conteyned the meditatiō
of heauenly things, and the

mysteries of our faith, is
principally necessary. First,
because by this wee must
obteyne dayly supply of
Grace, wherby we may
both resist temptations and
fulfill Gods diuine Commandements,
and perseuere
to the end: wherfore our
Lord warneth vs, that we
alwayes pray, to wit, as
much as conueniently we
may, and as far forth as the
fraylty, and necessary affaires
of this world will permit
vs: for our perseuerance
and eternall safety dependeth
on Prayer.
                     
                        
Secondly by Prayer &
Meditation we list vp our
mynd to Almighty God,
we place our selues in his
sight and presence; wee cō
                        sider
his Maiesty, his Power,
and his Wisedome, his
Goodnes & his prouidence,
his Mercy and his Iustice;
we adore him, and praise
him, we giue him thankes
and blesse him; there we
deale with him about the
busines of our Saluation,
and call to mynd all things
which he hath both done
and suffered for vs.
                     For this cause especially,

a Virgin must abandone
Marriage and secularity, &
imbrace the state of holy
Virginity, according to
the Apostole, to wit, that
she may thinke of these
things which belonge to
our Lord, that she may be
holy in body and spirit, that
she may behaue her selfe
worthily in the presence &
conuersation of Almighty
God, that she may sticke so
close vnto him, that she
may neuer be drawn away:
and as our Interpreter translateth
it, that she may haue
free leaue to beseech any

thing of our Lord, without
hinderance.
                     Heere are delights and
spirituall comforts; in this
consisteth as it were the Paradise
of our soules; by these
things our conuersation is
in heauen, and we are made
to enioy the society of Angels:
without these whatsoeuer
we do, is dry & barren,
for all comfort and spirituall
ioy proceedeth from
the attentiue consideration
of diuine matters.
                     From whence it commeth,
that those who apply
not themselues with great

loue and desire, to Prayer
and Meditation, they must
needs remaine dry, or at
leastwise they shall neuer
tast the most excellent delights
of the spirit. By Prayer
& meditation the mind
is exercysed, and groweth
zealous in the function &
habit of other vertues, because
the guift of grace is
more aboundantly obteyned
by it, whereby the labour
of vertue is made more
easy and delightfull.
                     Hence the Royall Prophet
saith, Viam mādatorū &c.
I haue runne the course and

way of thy commaundements,
whilst thou dilatedst
my hartwith ioy. And
why? because the vanity
of the world, & the worth
of vertue, and the Charity
of God, and the reward of
life to come, are shewed
therby vnto vs. The consideration
of all which, must
needs greatly stir vs vp to
all offices of vertue, and to a
diligent care of our owne
saluation.
                     Reading of Spirituall
bookes also is commended
by the holy Fathers, and
commeth very neere to the

exercise of Prayer. For as
by Prayer we obteyne the
conuersation euen of God
himselfe; so do we it also
by reading of spirituall
books. Whereupon Isidorus
in his 3. booke of Sentences
the 8. Chap. saith: Who
alwayes wil conuerse with
God, must pray often, and
read much; for when we
pray, we speake familiarly
vnto God, but when we
read, he speaketh vnto vs.
                     And afterward be addeth,
that Spirituall profit
also proceedeth from praying
and reading.
                     
                        
Lastly handy-worke is
greatly commēded, for this
is an especiall and beneficiall
Exercise for three
things. The first is, therby
somewhat to release and
refresh our minde; for we
cannot alwayes attend to
read or pray, but it is
needfull to recreate our
minde by intermixing of
labours sometymes betwēe,
least we should be ouerwearyed:
and this is done
most conueniently by outward
imployments, in
which the mind is little or
nothing at all buysied.
                     
                        
Whence it followeth,
that this manner of variety
becommeth most gratefull
to our weake and changeable
Nature, and hath beene
vsed in all ages by men and
women, such as were holy;
and likewise it helpeth to
auoyd idlenes, which is especially
to be taken heed
of, by all such as endeauour
to attaine to the perfection
of a deuout and holy life.
For as S. Ierome in his Epistle
to Demetriades sayth, there
is nothing more hurtfull to
any deuout purpose then
Idlenes, which doth not

only omit to get new perfectiō,
but also wasteth that
which was gotten before.
And Blessed Ignatius saith,
Otium omnium malorum &c.
Idlenes is said to be the beginning
of all mischiefe;
for a minde that is not imployed,
is open to all suggestions
and impressions of
the diuell.
                     Wherby sometymes it
commeth to passe, as Seneca
witnesseth, that although
the body be guiltlesse, yet
the mind being idle, falleth
into a thousande sorts of
lewdnesse. Wherfore it is

good to be alwaies doing
of somewhat, and to imploy
our minds about one
good action or other, that
the diuell may alwayes find
vs busy.
                     Lastly it is beneficiall
for the health of our body,
and to giue good example
also, and to releeue others.
For no Almes is so pleasing
to Almighty God, no guift
so acceptable, as that which
is earned by our owne labours.
S. Hierome discourseth
at large of this point in his
epistle to Demetriades, which
for breuities sake I omit.
                     
                        
It resteth now to speake
of the third, to wit of the
vse of their Riches. Holy
Fathers set downe the manner
at large, how amongst
Virgins, those who are
wealthy shold imploy their
meanes; to wit, not in superfluous
apparell, not in
banquetting and pleasures,
not in adorning their bodyes,
not in Iewels, pearles,
rings, bracelets, not in rich
& curious houshould-stuff,
not in riot and excesse of
brauery aboue their neighbours;
but in the succour &
releife of the poore, and of

such as are seruants of God.
                     S. Cyprian in his booke
De disciplina & habitu Viginum,
discourseth at large vpon
this thing: I will only alleadge
one sentence for breuityes
sake: Locupletem te dicu
&c. Thou boastest (quoth
he) that thou art wealthy
and rich, and thou thinkest
that it behooueth thee to
vse the riches which God
hath permitted thee to possesse.
Do so, vse them, but
let it be in such thinges as
may concerne the health of
thy soule. Vse them, but in
that which God hath commaunded.

thee to vse them,
& in which he hath shewed
thee & taught thee how
to doe. Let the poore find
thee to be rich, and those
that are needy perceaue thee
to be wealthy. Put out thy
Patrimony to vse, into the
handes of Almighty God.
Giue meate vnto Christ,
that it may be lawfull for
thee to sustayne the glory of
thy Virginity. And to the
end that it may be rewarded
by our Lord, beg it of
him by the prayers of many.
Lay vp thy treasures
there, where no thiefe can

dig them out, where no
wait-layer, or night-robber
can breake through.
Purchase to thy selfe possessions,
but let them be of
heauen, where neither rust
shall eate, nor hayle fall vpon,
nor Sunne burne, nor
rayne corrupt thy fruites,
they being continuall and
euerlasting, free from the
touch of secular abuse &c.
                     And S. Hierome in his
Epistle to Demetriades sayth:
Consideremus &c. Let vs consider
how wisely Wisdome
it self hath spoken: Sell what
thou hast. To whome is this

commanded? To wit, to
him to whome it is sayd:
If thou wilt be perfect, sell
not a part of thy goods, but
all. And when thou hast
sould them, what followeth?
Giue them to the poor,
not to the rich, not to thy
Neighbors who are wealthy,
not to maintaine excesse,
but to suffice necessity.
Whether he be a Priest, or
thy cozen, or kinsman, thou
shalt consider in him no other
respect but his pouerty.
Let the bowels of those that
are hungry, not the fat banquets
of those that surfet receaue

thy almes &c.
                     Yet for all this it is
not the meaning of S. Hierom,
that if a Virgin entreth
not in to Religiō, she should
depriue her selfe, of that
which is needfull for her
selfe to liue on in good for;
but that she bestow therest
which she hath superfluous,
for the vse of the poore,
& that after the manner
which she iudgeth to be
most to the honour of God.
                     
                        S. Cyprian before mentioned
goeth yet for ward, speaking
to those who hauing
vowed Virginity, and are

very rich & wealthy, thus:
But there be some rich women
& very wealthy, who
will set out, and shew their
store, & say, that they must
vse their owne goods. Let
these first vnderstand, that
she is rich, who is rich in
God; that she is wealthy
who is wealthy in Christ;
that those be goods indeed,
which be spirituall, diuine,
and heauenly, which lead
vs to God, which with stedfast
possession remaine to
vs when we be with God.
But whatsoeuer things are
earthly, gottē in this world,

and heere to remaine within
the world, they must be
contemned as well as the
world it self, whose pomps
and pleasures we doe then
renounce, when with a
better pace, we come towards
God. S. Iohn doth exhort
and stir vs vp, contesting
with his spirituall &
heauenly voice: Do not, saith
he, loue the world nor those things
which are in the world. If any
man loue the world, the Charity
of the Father is not in him, because
all that is in the world, is
the concupiscence of the flesh, and
the concupiscence of the eyes, and

the ambition of the world▪ which
is not of the Father, but of the
concupiscence of the world. And
the world shall passe and the concupiscence
therof. But he that doth
the will of God abideth for euer,
euen as God abideth for euer.
                     
                     Wherefore eternal &
diuine thinges are to be
sought after, and all things
are to be done according to
Gods will▪ that so we may
follow the footsteps of our
Lord, and his diuine exexamples,
who did warne
vs and say: I descended not from
heauen to do myne owne will, but
the will of him that sent me.
                        
Now if the seruant be not
greater then his Maister, &
he that is made free oweth
duety to his deliuerer, we
that desire to be Christians,
must imitate that which
Christ did. It is written,
it is read, it is heard, and for
our example celebrated by
the Churches mouth. He
that sayth, he abideth in
Christ, ought euen as he
walked, himselfe also to
walke. We must therefore
walke with equal steps, we
must endeauour to follow
his paces. Then doth the
following of the Truth, answere

to the Faith of the
name, and reward is giuen
to him that belieueth, whē
that which is belieued is
also done.
                     Thou sayst, that thou
art wealthy and rich: but
S. Paul doth obiect against
thy riches, and prescribe
with his wordes, that thy
trimming and decking is
to be moderated by an vprighteous
end. Let women
sayth he, with shamfastnes
and modesty adorne themselues,
not in plaited hayre,
nor gold, nor pretious stons
nor gorgeous apparell, but

as it becōmeth women promising
chastity by good
conuersation. S. Peter likewise
doth consent with
these precepts and say: Let
there be in a woman, not
the outward decking of fairenes,
or of gold, or of goodly
garmentes, but the trimming
of the hart. Now if
these men do admonish vs,
that euen those women,
who are wont to excusethe
adorning of themselues for
their husbāds saks, are to be
restrained, and moderated
by religious obseruation,
according to Ecclesiasticall

disciplin: how much more
expedient is it that a Virgin
should obserue the same?
Who deserueth no pardon
of this her trimming, neither
can she cast her fault,
vpon another, but she her
selfe must beare all the blame.
                     Thou dost say, that thou
art wealthy and rich: but
not all that may, ought also
to be done. Neither must
inordinate desires, and such
as spring vp out of the ambition
of the world, be extended
beyond the honesty
& shamfastnes of a Virgin,

for so much as it is writen:
All thinges are lawfull, but
all thinges are not expedidient.
All things are lawfull,
but all thinges do not
edify. But if thou adorne
thy selfe ouer sumptuously,
and go abroad, so as al men
may note thee, and draw
the eyes of young men to
regard thee, and make them
sigh after thee, and nourish
their vnlawfull appetite to
desire thee, and kindle their
fire to longe after thee, in
such sort, that albeit thou
perish not thy selfe, yet thou
art the ruine of others, and

shew thy selfe as a sword or
poyson to those that looke
on thee; thou canst not be
excused, as if thou wert
chast and honest in mind.
Thy wanton attyre, and
dishonest trimming doth
reprehend thee; neither
canst thou be numbred amongst
the Damsels & Virgins
of Christ, who dost
liue so, as if thou wouldest
be loued.
                     Thou dost say that thou
art wealthy and rich; but
it beseemeth not a virgin
to vaunt of her riches, because
holy scripture saith:

what good hath our pride
donne vnto vs, or what
profit hath the vaunting
of riches brought vs? All
those things or past away
like a shadow. And againe
the Apostle doth admonish
vs and say: And they that
buy, let them be as though
they possessed not; and they
that vse this world, as
though they vsed it not: for
the figure of this world passeth
a way. S Peter also vnto
whome our Lord c
                           •
                        mmē
                        ded
his sheepe to feed, and
to defend them, and vpon
whome he set and founded

his Church, did denie that
he had either gold or siluer,
saying that he was rich in
the grace of Christ, and
wealthy in his faith and
power; by which he could
do strange and miraculous
things, and by which he
aboūded in spirituall goods
to attain the grace of glory.
These goods and riches she
can not possesse, who desireth
to be esteemed rich,
rather to the world than to
Christ. Thus far S. Cyprian.
                     
                     The fourth is her conuersation,
wherein the holy
Fathers prescribe to Virgins

that they must auoyd
frequentation of marriages
publique banquettings, &
the company and conuersation
of secular persons, especially
of such are light in
their behauiour, and are
giuen vnto the world; and
that she should conuerse
with modest and deuout
women.
                     So saith S. Cyprian in the
place aboue cyted, Quosdam
non pudet nubētibus interesse &c.
Some (quoth he) are not ashamed
to be presēt at Marriages,
and in that liberty of
lasciuious talke, to chatte

with the rest, and mingle
now and then, impure &
dishonest speaches; to heare
that which is not fitting to
be heard, nor lawfull to
speake againe; yea and to be
euen present at lasciuious
conferences, and drunken
banquets, by which the
fuell of Lust is kindled.
The Bride now accustomed
to the patience of hearing
vnchastnes, and the
Bridegrome to be the more
audacious, what place is it
then to be at Marriages, for
such a one whose minde is
neuer to be marryed? And

though she remaine both in
body & mind a virgin, yet
by her eares, and eyes, she
hath lost part of that which
she had before.
                     
                        S. Hierome likewise in his
epist. to Demetriades▪
                         Decline
and auoyd (saith he) the
husbands of Matrons, such
as serue the world, for feare
least thy mind be troubled,
and thou heare either what
the husband sayth to the
wife, or the wife to the
husband, for such Conferences
are poyson vnto others.
Choose women that
are graue, and especially

Widdowes and Virgins to
be thy companions, whose
conuersation is approued to
be good, their speaches well
gouerned; & their outward
modesty presages their sanctity
within. Auoyd the
wantonnes and immodesty
of yong Maydes, who attire
their heads stangely,
weare lockes at their eares,
make their skynne smooth
by art, paint, weare straite
bodies, and sleeues, must
not haue a wrinkle in their
cloathes, weare creaking
shoes, and all this forsooth,
that vnder the name of a

Mayde, they may seeme the
more salable. For the comportment
and inclination
of the Mistresse, is oftentymes
iudged and proportioned,
by that of the wayting
woman, and such as they
keep company withal &c.
                     
                        S. Hierome goeth on thus:
And this likewise a Virgin
must take specially heed
of, that she neuer talke or
cōuerse at any tyme alone,
with any man, whether he
be secular or religious, no
not so much as with her
ghostly Father, withont
the company of others: but

let all things be done openly,
where they may be beheld
of others. Or if it be
necessary at any tyme to
talke with any man within
doors, let it not be done,
vnles some other be present
who may see al. For it is an
vnseemly thing for a man,
thogh be her Confessarius,
yea religious (& though his
habit should make him
seeme to be euen of the sanctity
of S. Iohn Baptist) to
be alone with a woman
in a chamber, the doore being
shut, and without any
other present; whether it be

vnder pretense of Confession,
or any spirituall instruction
whatsoeuer. Let her
remember that Thamar in
priuate, for want of presence
of others, was rauished
by her owne brother. Let
her remember that for the
most part all that haue fallē
in this kind, haue done it
through the neglect of this
aduice.
                     If there were no conferēce
in priuat, there would
hardly any dishonesty be
euer committed. Therfore
this especially is to be obserued
of a virgin, as a precept,

That she keep herselfe
vndefiled, both before God
and men
                     
                        S. Ambrose also in his 2. bo.
vpon S. Lukes ghospell saith:
Trepidare virginum est &c. virgins
ought to tremble and
feare, as often as any man
comes into their presence,
and be affrayde to speake
vnto any man &c. he speaketh
of such a one when she
is alone (for in priuate they
are fire and tow to one another:)
and the diuell neuer
more imployeth all his
strength and endeauour,
then at such a tyme, for

feare least so fit an occasion
should escape without benefit
vnto him. See more
concerning this matter in
S. Hierome in his 8. 9. 10. 11.
and 22. Epistle.
                     Of any vow of Obedience
to be made to ones
ghostly Father, I finde nothing
written in holy Fathers,
neither do I iudg it
expedient (vnlesse in some
few who are truly perfect,
& are become euen maisters
as it were, in the way of
Perfection) by reason of
many discommodityes,
that may follow thereof.

Wherfore it is deseruedly
forbiddē in the Rules of the
Society of Iesus, that any
such Vow should be admitted
by any Father of that
Order. To which also may
be added the solemne decre
of the Prouinciall Councel
of Mechline which by chaūce
I happened vpon lately,
wherein the 5. tytle the 7.
Chap. are these words. Nemo
aliquem ad perpetuò &c. No
Ghostly father shall bynde
any one, neuer to confesse
his sinnes to any other then
to him &c. And this Synod
declareth all such Obligation

or promise, though
confirmed by vow, to be
vnreasonable, indiscreet,
voyd, and of no effect; &
therefore as far, as it shalbe
needfull, doth by this present
Decree ordeyne it to
be so. I omit also many other
things which may be
alleadged for this purpose.
                     These prescriptions of
holy Fathers, if a virgin
keep, liuing in the world,
she shall be happy, and her
Estate and condition shall
come neere to the perfectiō
of a Religious life.
                  
                  
                     
                     CHAP. VIII. VVhether single life, confirmed by
Vow, may be properly
called an Estate.
                     SOME seeme to make
doubt, Whether single
life cōfirmed by vow, ought
properly to be called an Estate,
nor do▪ I know vpon
what grounds. Neuertheles
it may be easily gathered
out of that which hath byn
sayd before, that this manner
of liuing, may be properly
called an Estate, and

that such as professe the sam
may be rightly sayd to haue
chosen, and to be of an Estate.
                     For an Estate is nothing
els, but a manner of
life, in the which it is purposed
so to cōtinue, that it
may not be lawfull to goe
out therof into another, as
S. Thom. 2. 2. quaest. 183. and
other Doctours, doe euery
where teach: but vowed
Chastity or Virginity is a
manner of life, wherein it
is firmely purposed to continue,
so that it is not lawfull
to forsake the same &

marry; therefore it is properly
an Estate.
                     
                        Henriques teacheth the
same in his 12. Quodlibet,
where he sayth, That the
estate of Virginity or widdowhood
is no lesse to be
accounted an Estate in the
Church of God, then the
Estate of Marriage. And
Caietan affirmeth, that this
doctrine of Henriques is true,
according to the Law, if
Virginity or Widdowhood
be kept, or professed by obligation
of vow.
                     And surely if there
be in the Church an Estate

of Marriage, why should
there not be also an Estate
of Virginity or widdowhood?
If there be an Estate
of those which are wedded,
why should there not be
the like of those that liue
continent, especially when
S. Cyprian witnesseth; That
this is the more beautyfull part or
portion of Christ. If marriage
with a mortall man or woman,
which can continue
but a small tyme, setleth a
man in an Estate, why
should not also an eternall
marriage with Christ himself,
which is neuer to haue

end, effect the same? Those
who at this prensent are in
the state of wedlocke, continue
not longe therin, but
after a litle time by death of
the one party, must go out
of it, into the estate of such
as liue single: but such as
are now in the Estate of
thos
                           •
                         that liue continent,
shall neuer go out of it, but
alwayes remaine therein.
From whence it appeares
that this is rather, and more
perfectly to be tearmed an
Estate, then that of Wedlocke.
                     Neither doth it auaile,

that this vow of perpetuall
Virginity may be dispensed
with all, and that therfore
this Estate seemeth not
to be firme & immoueable.
First, because such a dispensation
may be only graunted
by the Pope himselfe,
yea is very seldome graunted,
and that for matters of
great importance: otherwise
such release is not of
force before Almighty God;
but that which is only cō
                        predended
vnder the power
of the Pope may be lawfully
thought impossible to
vs, and therefore it diminisheth

not the immobility
or remouall of this estate:
for it is sufficient, that by vs
as much as is on our parts,
it is firme and immoueable,
in so much that it cannot
be altered by vs; otherwise
Religion it selfe should not
be an Estate, since the Pope
may vpon iust occasions of
great importance, release a
Religious man from the obligation
of his Order, dispense
with his vowes, and
permit him to marry.
                     Secondly also, because
Marriage is an Estate, yet it
may be many wayes dissolued,

to wit before carnall
knowledge of one another,
by entring into Religion;
and also after the knowledg
of one another by death of
the wife, or husband. Also
by the Adultery of the husband,
the wife hath right
of a diuorce, whereby the
Marriage it selfe is dissolued
euen to euery duety & coniugall
act, as though it had
beene no marriage at all, although
the habituall obligation
remaine.
                     Finally if it be contracted
in the Estate of infidelity,
it may be dissolued,

although it were consumated,
by copulation, if so be
the one be conuerted to the
Catholike fayth, and the other
perseuere in Infidelity.
Therefore Wedlocke is far
more easily, & more wayes
dissolued, then the vow of
Virginity: and yet that hindreth
not, but that it is, and
may be truely called an Estate;
much lesse therefore
shal that power of releasing
it, which consisteth only in
the authority of the Prince
of spirituall matters, hinder
the vow of Virginity of
being tearmedan Estate.
                     
                        
Thirdly a Cleargy Estate
is made a true Estate
by meanes of the Vow of
Chastity, added to holy Orders,
and hath sufficient firmenesse;
and yet the Pope
may easily take it away, especially
in a Deacon, and
giue him leaue to marry.
Therefore it followeth &c.
                     Lastly, Seruitude is a
true Estate, according to al
lawes, and yet at the Maisters
pleasure, the seruant
may be enfranchised, and
made free: Therefore that
extrinsecal power of taking
away any obligatiō, which

consisteth not in our owne
powers, doth by no meanes
impaire the assurednesse &
certainty of an Estate. For
it is inough, that it is firme
and immutable on our part.
And the reason is, because
he is sufficiently sayd to be
in an Estate, who maketh
choice of a certaine kinde
of life, and settleth himself
firmely therein, so that he
cannot take any other vpon
him differēt vnto this,
but must continue therein,
euen vnto death. But he
who imbraceth single life,
and byndeth himselfe by

vow vnto it, chooseth to
himselfe a certaine kind of
life, & so establisheth himselfe
therein, as he cannot
passe out of it, vnto the
contrary. Therefore he is
in an Estate.
                     You will aske perhaps,
Whether this Estate may
be called an Estate of Perfection?
I answere, that it is
not a complete Estate of
Perfectiō, but only in part,
because it is a notable part
of the Estate of perfectiō for
some Estates include more,
& others lesse. An Estate of
Perfection which is entire

and complete, includeth also
the vow of Pouerty and
Obedience, both which
a Virgin vowing Chastity
in the world, may also after
her manner, imitate and
supply before God.

                  THE
PREFACE
TO ALL
deuout Widdowes.
                  
                     
                        BECAVSE
thou hast loued
Chastity & remained
a Widow
after thy husbād, therfore

the hand of our Lord
hath strengthned thee, &
thou shalt be blessed for euer.
These wordes were
spoken to the holy, vertuous,
and renowned
Widdow Iudith, who for
her chast Widdowhood,
deserued to be so strengthened
of our Lord, that
she ouercame, and killed
the great and cruel Holofernes,
deliuered the people
of Israell from tribulation
and death, and reduced

them to their former
peace and tranquillity.
                  And for this cause
did she also deserue to be
exalted to the Heauens,
by Ioachim the high Priest
who withall the people,
blessed her & sayd: Thou
art the glory of Hierusalē,
thou the ioy of Israel, thou
the honour of our people,
because thou hast done manfully,
and thy hart was
strēgthned from aboue &c.
                     
And besides all this, for
her chast Widdowhood
did she merit an euerlasting
blessing from our
Lord, to wit, aboundance
of all graces in this
world, and perfect felicity
in heauen.
                  In like manner all vertuous
Widdows following
these her traces and
footsteps shall deserue to
be cōforted by our Lord
with spirituall graces,
vertues, and gifts of the

holy Ghost, in such sort,
that they shalbe euer blessed
and happy, if deuoutly
they perseuere in their
chast Widowhood, & shal
also deserue to ouercome
& trample the diuell vnder
foot, signifyed by the
aforesayd proud and cruell
Captaine Holofernes.
And to the end, that they
may thus constantly and
deuoutly perseuere in the
holy Estate of Continē
                     cy
in their widdowhood,

we will, with the help of
the holy Ghost, say something
to this purpose, as
as wel out the holy Scriptures,
as ancient Fathers
and Historyes.
               
            
            
               
                  
                  THE
WIDDOWES
GLASSE.
                  
                     CHAP. I. VVho are to be accounted truely
VViddowes.
                     THERE are sayd to be
three kindes of Chastity,
to wit, that of Marriage,
that of Widdowes,
& that of Virgins; al three

signifyed by the good groūd
mentioned in the Holy
Ghospell, wheron the seed
fell: The first wherof yielded
fruit thirthy fould, the
second sixty fould, and the
last an hundred. But they
who cannot yeild the hundred-fould
fruit, let them at
least offer vp sixty, to shew
themseues more liberall towards
our Sauiour.
                     And for as much as
all perfection of man consisteth
in abandoning and
forsaking carnal and worldly
things, & drawing neer
and ioyning himselfe vnto

God his Creatour, louing
him, fearing him, seeking
him, thinking on him, contemplating
and honouring
him in euery thing and action;
this can hardly be affected
in the state of Marriage,
especially by womē,
who hunting after, & dayly
following the delightes
and pleasures of the world,
are hindred thereby, for the
most part, from treading the
true path which leadeth directly
thereunto. But Widdowes
who are free from
such cares and troubles, and
haue a true desire, may with

great case and facility performe
the same to their
great comfort.
                     Now, there be diuers
sorts of Widdowes. Some,
as soone as their husbands
be dead, purpose so marry
againe, for some temporall
comfort and consolation,
not hauing any diuine Inspiration
to serue God Almighty
in that Estate, and
are in danger to offend him.
Of this sort of widdowes
S. Paul speaketh, when he
saith. I will, that the yong widdowes
do marry againe, & become
mothers of families, not to giue occasion

to the Diuell to tempt them.
And this is not ill but approued
of all. But when
a widdow will marry againe
for any disordinate
appetit, or because she is
very rich, or faire, or soght
after by some one that is
placed in a high degree of
Honour or State, or for any
other vicious occasion, or ill
end, without doubt this her
desire is naught, nor is she
to be reckoned, or worthily
called a widdow, as long
as she remaynes with this
desyre, although she do not
actually marry againe.
                     
                        
There is another sort of
widdowes, who though
they do not purpose to marry
againe at all, eyther for
that they haue no dowry,
or for feare least they happen
vpon an ill husband, or
for some other secret or manifest
respect, yet is their
manner of life and conuersation,
not like indeed vnto
widdowes: for that they
will allwayes be gadding
abroad, tatling, & gossipping,
euen with those who
be not reputed of the best
edification. And these,
forsooth, will be finely apparelled:

and though they
haue veyles, yet will they
scarsely couer their heades
with them; their eyes must
be rolling vp and downe,
they must go to banquets
weddings and playes, they
must tell tales, heare & tell
newes, & carry themselues
euen as meere secular, ordinary,
and the worst sort of
people. These are to be auoyded
and shunned by all true
widdowes: and these be
those of whome S. Paul speaketh
in another place, saying:
Take heed of such yonge
widdowes, for after that they haue

liued riotously, and licentiously in
Christ, they will marry, carrying
with them their damnation, for
that they haue broken and made
voyd their first faith. &c. And
for these it were better that
they did marry againe, then
liue as they do.
                     Another sort there is,
who neuer intend, nor do
indeed marry againe, but
liue chastely & vertuously,
both in act and desyre. But
yet they do it not for the
loue of God, but rather for
some humaine respect, as
for the loue of their childrē,
their goods, or the like. And

although according to the
esteeme of the world, they
liue honestly, and are reputed
for Venerable Mothers
and Matrones; yet
are they wholy dedicated to
the seruice of the world, &
haue little feeling or gust
of spirituall things; and do
but seldome frequent the
Sacraments or sermons, fast
only but when the church
commandeth them, or doe
imploy themselues in any
other spirituall Exercises.
These I do intreat, by the
bowels of Christ Iesus, that
they will no longer imploy

the gifts and graces which
they haue receaued frō our
Lord, to the honour and
seruice of the world, to the
end they may haue their
reward in heauen, and not
on earth.
                     There is another sort of
widdowes also, who make
a firme purpose and deliberation,
to conserue and
keep their chastity & serue
God with all their hart: &
of these there are two kinds.
One who cannot separate
themselues from their children,
or other parents, either
for the charge they

haue of thē, or because they
cannot so wel liue alone, or
for some necessity, or charity
in gouerning their family:
and these although they
be not wholy free from the
world, nor are dedicated to
the seruice of God; notwithstanding
al the paynes
and labours they take, they
doe it principally for the
loue of God, of whom they
shalbe rewarded with life
euerlasting. These Widdowes
are not any to be remoued,
or drawne away
from this kind of life, but
are, according to S. Paul,
                        
greatly to be honoured and
esteemed.
                     The other kind, are
those Widdowes, who desirous
to serue God, & may
commodiously separat thē
                        selues
from their parents,
friends, or family, and be
more free to attend to prayer
and other deuout exercises;
yet they will not, thorough
a kind of pufill animity,
or little courage, or
els for compassion to their
friendes, or for some other
reason. Neither are these
to be condemned, but esteemed
in a second, or third

degree from the former.
                     The last sort of widdowes,
are the true, & worthily
so called, Widdowes, who
dispatching themselues of
al worldly impedimēts, do
attend only to the seruice
of God cōtemplating him,
and meditating on him day
and night. And these are
placed in a more quiet and
peaceable Estate, then any
of the others aboue named,
and are entred into the
right, and direct way of
perfection.
                     In this Estate liued that
Holy Widdowe Anne the

Prophetesse, recorded by
S. Luke; who is sayd to
haue serued God in fasting
& prayer, remaining night
and day in the Temple. And
if such Widdowes, who
haue a desire to liue vertuously
cānot match or come
neere to S. Anne; yet let thē
come as neere vnto her as
they can.
                     So as I conclude, that the
true Widdow, is she, who
not only conserues her
Chastity in the world, but
also whatsoeuer she doth,
she doth it purely for the
honour and seruice of Almighty

God. And for that
euery widdow doth not
know how to exercise her
selfe in the truly seruing of
God, vnlesse she know the
scope and end therof, I purpose
heere to set downe
briefly in what manner she
is to do the same.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. II. Of the Intention, and Exercise
of a true VViddow.
                     VVHEN a Widdow
hath well considered
of her Estate & firme
purpose to serue God, it is
necessary, that first she vnderstand

what is the end &
scope of this kind of life,
that conformably therto,
she may addresse all her
workes and actions.
                     The first and principal
end then is, that not onely
Widdowes but euery Christian
also ought to liue wel
and in the feare of God,
whome she must loue more
then her owne soule: and
therefore she must labour,
that by al her endeauours &
actions the name of God
may be euer blessed & praised,
Christian fayth and religion
aduanced, and honoured.

This belongeth
more to Widdowes then to
many others, who consequently
must be mortifyed,
and of a chast and pure life.
For that they hauing lost
their carnall Spouses, they
ought to seeke for no other
but their Spouse Christ Iesus.
So as a truely deuout
Widdow ought so to inflame
her hart with the zeale
of Gods honour, that she
should choose rather to dye,
then that by her means, her
Spouse should be any way
dishonoured.
                     Secondly she ought with

as great zeale seek and procure
her owne saluation,
considering that she is not
alwayes to remayne in this
world, because it is ordayned
for al men once to dye,
and then of necessity, to go
either to heaue, or to intollerable
torments in Hell,
or Purgatory. And therefore
hauing as it were, lost
and forgone all the Consolations
of this transitory
world, she must force her
self, to get & conserue those
that be celestiall, and euerlasting.
                  
                  
                     
                     CHAP. III. Documents for VViddowes out of
S. Paul.
                     SAINT Paul wryting to
Timothy sayth: Honour
VViddowes. He meaneth such
Widdowes who liue vertuously
according to the rule
of Widdow-hood, that is
to say, to gouerne wel their
families, not only their children,
or their kinsfolkes,
but also their subiects, instructing
them in good life,
manners and vertue, and
when it is needfull to reprehend
and correct them.

Secondly he sayth, That
Widdowes ought to hope
in God, to trust in his mercy;
in him alone to seeke
for Comfort and consolation,
hauing dayly their
mind eleuated in God in al
humility, praying often,
and imploring his diuine
ayde to preserue them from
all euill, to forgiue them,
(and all sinners) their sins,
to replenish them with his
gifts and graces, and lastly
to guide them to eternall
felicity.
                     Thirdly he sayth, That
a VViddow entertayning

worldly & carnall consolations,
& passing her dayes
in mirth, ioylity, & vanity
is accompted for dead. For
although she liue according
to the body, yet is she dead
according to the spirit; nor
can she once do any good or
meritorious work, worthy
of heauen.
                     Fourthly, he commandeth
widdowes, That they
should be irreprehensible in
all their words and deeds;
that is to say, that in all
their actiōs they giue good
example, & that they keep
themselues, not only from

cōmitting of mortal crims,
but euen from the least veniall
sinnes that may be.
Whence it followes, that
if they liue vertuously, hū
                        bly,
in feare and vigilancy,
it may be said of them, as
it was said of Iudith, that
most noble and deuout widdow,
That neuer was there foūd
any man who spake euill of her.
                     
                     Fifthly he sayth, That
the Widow ought to think
vpon those things that belong
vnto God, to the end
she may be holy & sanctifyed
in body and spirit &c.
                  
                  
                     
                     CHAP. IIII. The prayse of VViddowhood, out
of S. Hierome.
                     SAINT Hierome, amongst
the rest of Ancient Fathers,
is not the last, nor
least that hath praysed widdowhood;
nay I may say,
he hath exalted the same aboue
many, if not aboue all
the rest. And to begin first
with an Epistle of his to
Furia, a Noble yong Lady
and widdow of Rome,
thus he wryteth vnto her in
cōmendation of the crown
of Widdowhood.
                     
                        
You desire in your letter,
and humbly intreate me,
that I will answere you,
or rather write vnto you
in what manner you may
liue, & conserue the crowne
of widdowhood, without
any blemish of the honour
of your good Name. My
mind reioiceth, my bowells
do daunce, my affection
doth leape, because you desire
to be such after your
husbands death, as your mother
Titiana of holy memory
was a long time her husbād
liuing. Her praiers and deuotions
are heard. She hath

obtained in her only daughter,
that which she possessed
whilest she liued.
                     You haue moreouer a very
great Priuiledge of your
Ancestours, that euen from
Camillus, either none at all,
or very few women of your
stocke was married the second
time: so that you are
not so much to be praised,
if you remain a widdow; as
to be detested, if being a
Christian, you perfourme
not that, which heathen
women for so many ages
haue obserued. I say nothing
of Paula & Eustochiū, flowers

of your family, least I may
seeme to take occasion by
the exhorting of you, to
praise them. I let passe Blesilla
which following her husbād
your brother, in a short
space of life, fulfilled many
yeares of vertue.
                     And I would to God
that men would imitate the
praises of women, & wrinckled
ould age would performe
that which voluntary
youth doth offer. Wittingly
& willingly I thrust
my hand into the fire. Many
countenances wil frowne,
many armes will be spread

abroad, and angry Chremes
will rage with his foaming
mouth. Many great
personages will be incensed
against my Epistles: the
whole company of Nobles
will thunder out, and say
I am a witch, that I am a
seducer, worthy to be banished
from all ciuill common
wealthes. Let them
adde, if they will, a Samaritane
also, that I may acknowledge
my Lords title.
                     Surely, I do not deuide
the daughter from her father
Neither do I say that
of the gospell, Suffer the

to bury the dead. For whosoeuer
beleeueth in Christ
liueth, and whosoeuer beleueth
in him, ought surely
to walke, euen as he walked.
Honour your father,
but so, as he seuere you not
from your true father. So
long acknowledg the linck
of your bloud, how long he
acknowledgeth his Creatour.
For otherwise Dauid
will presently sing vnto
you: Heare O daughter, &
see, and incline thine eare,
and forget thy people, and
the house of thy father: and
the King will desire thy

beauty, because he is thy
Lord, thy God, and thy
King.
                     O great reward of forgetting
ones Father! The
King wil desire thy beauty:
because thou hast heard, because
thou hast seene, because
thou hast inclined thy
eare, & forgot thy people
and the house of thy father;
therfore will the King desire
thy beauty, and will say
vnto thee: Thou are al faire,
O my Deare, and there is
no spotte in thee. What
thing more faire then the
soule, which is called the

daughter of God, and seeketh
no forraine ornamēts?
she beleeueth in Christ, and
with this ambition she
goeth to her spouse, hauing
the same to her Lord, and
to her spouse.
                     What miseries mariage
haue, you haue learned in
marriage it selfe: and you
haue bene filled with that
which you longed for, euen
vnto loathsomenes. Your
lawes haue tryed most bitter
choler, you haue cast out
those sower & vnwholsom
meates, you haue eased your
boyling stomake. Why wil

you yet throwe in againe
that which once was hurtfull
vnto you? The dogge
returneth to his vomit, and
the sow againe to her wallowing
in the mire. The
very brute beastes, & restles
birdes, do not fall the secōd
time into the same snares &
nettes.
                     Do you feare least the
family of the Furij be extinguished,
and least your father
haue not a babe by
you, which may creepe in
his bosome, and beslauer his
necke? What, I pray you?
haue all which are maried,

children? And those children
which they haue, do
they alwaies answere to
their kinred? Yea surely Ciceroes
sonne did resemble
his fathers eloquence: and
Cornelia your Auncestresse,
an example of honesty and
fecundity, had much ioy of
the Gracchi her sonnes. It is
ridiculous to hope of a certainty
for that, which both
many haue not had, & haue
lost when once they had it.
                     To whom wil you leaue
so great riches? To Christ
who cannot dye. Who shall
be your heire? he which is

also my Lord. Your father
will mourne, but Christ
will reioyce; your family
will be sorowfull, but the
Angels will be ioyfull. Let
your father do what he wil
with his substance: you are
not his, by whom you were
borne, but his by whom
you were borne againe, and
who redeemed you with an
exceeding great price, euen
with his bloud.
                     So far, ould good S.
Hierom. Where you see what
esteeme he maketh of Widdowhood,
yea in a young,
noble, and beautifull Lady.

And no lesse doth he in another
Epistle of his to Marcella,
commending the courage
and resolution of Blesilla
a young & Noble widdow
also. Thus then he
writeth to Marcella of Blesilla
her sicknes.
                     Abraham is tempted in
his sonne, & is found more
faithfull. Ioseph is sould
into Aegipt, that so he may
feed his father & brethren.
Ezechias is terrified with
his death at hand, and dissolued
into teares, hath his
life prolonged for fifteene
yeares. Peter the Apostle is

afflicted, with our Lords
passion, and weeping bitterly,
he heareth; Feed my
sheepe. Paul a rauening
woolf, and another young
Beniamin is stroken blind
in a traunce, that he may
receiue his sight: and being
compassed with a suddaine
horrour of darknes, calleth
him Lord, whom before he
persecuted as man.
                     Euen so now, O Marcella,
we haue seene our louing
Blesilla thirty daies continually
to haue bene tormented
with the burning of an
ague, that she might learne

to reiect the delights of that
body which shortly after is
to be consumed with wormes.
To her also came our
Lord Iesus, and touched
her hand, and behould she
arising, now serueth him.
She sauoured somewhat of
negligence: and being tied
with the bandes of riches,
she lay in the sepulcher of
the world. But Iesus groned,
and being troubled in
spirit, cried out: Blesilla, come
forth. Who arose when she
was called, and being come
forth, now sitteh at the table
with our Lord.
                     
                        
Let the Iewes threaten
and swell, let them seeke
to murder her who hath
bene raised vp againe; and
let the ōly apostles reioyce.
She knoweth, that she
oweth her life vnto him,
who did restore it. She
knoweth that she ēbraceth
his feete, whose iudgment
lately she feared. Her body
lay almost dead: and death
approaching did shake her
gasping members. Where
were then the helpes of her
kinred? where were then
the wordes full of vanity?
She oweth nothing vnto

thee O vngratefull kinred,
which dying to the world
is reuiued vnto Christ.
Who is a Christian, let him
reioyce: he that is angry,
sheweth that he is no Christian.
                     A widdow loosed from
the bond of marriage, needeth
nothing but perseuerance:
But doth the course
garment offend any person?
let Iohn offend him, then
whom, amongst the sonnes
of women there was none
greater: who being called
an Angell, baptized our
Lord himselfe, for he also

was cladd with a Camells
skynne, and girded with a
girdle of hayre. Do grosse
meates displease them? nothing
is more grosse then
locusts. Let those women
rather offend Christian eies
who with vernish and colours
paint their eies, and
cheekes: whose plaistered
coūtenance deformed with
ouermuch shining, doth resemble
Idols. Who if they
happen for want of heed to
let fall a teare, it trickleth
downe in a furrow: whom
not so much as the very
number of their yeares can

perswade that they are old:
who with other folkes hair
set forth their head: and
paint out in aged wrinckles
their youth forespent: who
finally in presence of many
nephews are trimmed like
trembling girles.
                     Let the Christian woman
blush, if shee force the
comelinesse of nature, if
she make prouision for the
flesh vnto concupiscence, in
which according to the Apostle,
whosoeuer are delighted,
cannot please God.
Our widow before was very
carefully dressed: and all

the day at the glasse she studied
what might be amisse.
Now she confidently saith:
but we beholding the glory
of our lord with face reuealed,
are transformed into
the same image, from glory
vnto glory, as of our Lords
spirit. Then the maides did
platte her hayre, and the
harmeles head was wringed
with frizeled tops: but
now the vntrimmed head
knoweth this to suffice, that
it is couered.
                     Then did the very softnes
of feathers seeme hard,
and she could scarce lay in

the raysed bedds: now she
riseth betimes for to pray,
and with her shrill voice
preuenting the others, in
singing Alleluia, she is the first
which beginneth to prayse
her Lord. She kneeleth vpon
the bare ground, and
with often teares that face
is purged, which before
was defiled with painting.
After prayer, there are sung
psalmes: & the feeble neck,
and wearyed knees, & sleepy
eyes, for the earnest feruour
of the mind, can scant
obtain any rest. The mourning
gowne is least fouled,

when she lyeth on the
ground. The course pantoffle
affoardeth the price
of gilt shoes vnto the poore:
the girdle is not beset with
gold & pretious stones, but
of wollen, and most pure,
because of the simplicity,
& such as may rather straiten
the garments, then adorne
them.
                     If the Scorpion enuyeth
so good a purpose, and
with flattering speach perswade
againe to eate of the
forbidden tree; insteed of
a shoe, let him be crushed
with a curse; & whilest he

dyeth in his poyson let him
haue this answere: Go after
me Satan: which is as much
to say, as Aduersary; for he
is the Aduersary of Christ,
and an Antichrist, whosoeuer
is displeased with the
precepts of Christ.
                     I pray you, what haue
we done like vnto the Apostles,
that they are so offended?
They forsake their aged
Father with their ship
and nets: the Publican riseth
from the custom-house
& followeth our Sauiour:
The disciple which desired
to returne home, and bidd

friends farewell, is forbidden
by our Maisters voice.
The buriall of a Father is
not allowed, & it is a kind
of piety, for our Lord to be
voyd of pitty. We, because
we goe not in silkes, are esteemed
Monks, because we
are not drunke, neither open
our mouthes vnto dissolute
laughter, we are calcalled
graue and melancholy.
If our coate be not gorgeous,
we straight heare
that common Prouerbe: He
is an hypocrite, and deceauing
Grecian.
                     Let them vse euen yet

more rude scoffes; and carry
about with them men stuffed
with fat paunches. Our
Blesilla will laugh, and not
disdaine to hear the reproaches
of croking frogges,
whereas her Lord & Maister
was called Beelzebub.
                     
                     Hitherto S. Hierome.
And there might be heer set
downe many of his Epistls
of the same subiect in praise
and commendation of the
Crowne and Merit of Widdowhood,
if this litle treatise
were capable therof, or
that it were our intention
to make heereof a great volume.

And therfore we wil
content our selues at this
tyme with some briefe Aduertisementes
of his, concerning
the same subiect.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. V. Aduertisementes to VViddowes,
out of the same S. Hierome
                     MANY are the Instructions
& documents,
which the ancient Fathers,
haue set down for vertuous
& deuout Widdowes. And
first of all we will produce
what we find written by S.
Hierome aforesayd in diuers
places of his works, in the

briefest manner we can, not
to ouerweary the Widdow-Reader.
                     As those Widdowes
(sayth S. Hierome) who whē
they were marryed, did only
study to please their husbands:
so let those, who are
now freed from carnal marriage,
seeke and study only
to please God, whome they
haue chosen for their spouse
in place of their former husbands.
                     As Widdowes whilest
they were ioyned to the
world, did vse the vanity of
the world: so let them now

being ioyned to god, banish
from their hartes all vanityes.
                     As Widdowes, whilest
they were marryed in
the world, studyed how to
nourish and pamper their
bodyes, for the bearing of
children, & supporting the
burden of Marriage: so now
let them keep sobriety, and
bring their body into seruitude,
and subiect the same
to the spirit, thereby to be
able to serue their second
spouse Christ Iesus, in their
sacred and spirituall Marriage.
                     
                        
Let a Widdow be so
much the more a louer of
Chastity; by how much all
her actions, wordes, and
workes, may sauour of purity.
                     Let her neuer be alone,
as neere as possible, with
any man, that she need not
be ashamed, whensoeuer
she is seen to conuerse with
another.
                     Let her alwayes auoyd
the cōpany of vaine,
idle, and sensuall persons;
especially of Widdows that
should be so giuen: nor so
much as permit any such to

come neere vnto her.
                     Let her take great heed
neuer to detract, or murmure,
or speake euill of any
man. Let her also auoyd
those who vse to murmure,
and permit them not vpon
any occasion to speake euill
of any person in her presence,
to the end that those
who visit her, may be edifyed
by her vertuous comportment.
                     She must also haue a
great care of her honesty
and reputation, of which
she ought to be alwayes so
iealous, and fearefull, that

her speach, her face, and
all the actions of her body,
yea her very garments may
demonstrate the same; to
the end that no occasion be
giuē to others, not so much
as to thinke the contrary of
her.
                     By how much more
younge she is; by so much
the more ought she to be
graue, and venerable in all
her actions.
                     Let her not take too
much pleasure, or delight in
singing, especially of songs;
but let her recreate her selfe
honestly with those of her

owne house and family.
                     Let her alwayes haue at
hand, some book of deuotion;
& let her haue often recourse
vnto prayer, which
is the readiest way to driue
away all vayne and euill
thoughts, which the Enemy
may put into her mind.
                     And for that, the flesh
hath continually combat
with the spirit, let her vse
abstinence, and other mortifications,
to subdue the
same, according to the coū
                        sell
of her prudent Ghostly
Father.
                     As Anger and Choller is

naturall oftentymes to a
man: so neuer to be ouercome
therwith is most proper
to a Christian. Let the
widdow therfore take great
heed therof.
                     Let her alwayes haue before
her eyes the examples
of Indith, and Anne the Prophetesse,
widdowes, who
continually night and day
imployed their tyme in
prayer, fasting, and vertuous
exercises. For which
God gaue to one of them so
much grace and valour, as
to ouercome and cut off the
Diuels head, figured in that

of Holofernes; and to the other,
to be the first widdow
who should imbrace, and
receaue the Sauiour of the
world in her armes, and
thereby made partaker of
diuers diuine secrets.
                     Let her consider that her
soule, is the daughter of
God, & therfore she ought
not to vse any strang or fantastical
ornaments to adorn
her body; but let all her
study and care be to adorne
her soule, as it becommeth
the daughter of God,
                     She must not content
her selfe to haue begon any

thing well, but she must
study how to end it well:
although S. Paul began to do
euill, and ended with good;
and Iudas contrariwise began
to do well, but ended in
euill.
                     To what purpose should
there be colours & vernice
vsed, to paint the face of a
Christian? Such an ornament
of the body becommeth
not one, that serueth
Christ, but rather one who
serueth Antichrist. And if
any looke towardes heauen
with such a face, Christ wil
not know them, since they

haue changed that shape
which he gaue them.
                     Why do we promise
one thing, and do another?
And why doth the tongue
prayse Chastity, & the body
exercise Impurity?
                     It is a very great vertue,
& worthy to be sought
after with great diligence,
care, and watchfullnes, to
wit, to be born in the flesh,
& not to liue according to
the flesh.
                     If S. Paul feared, saying:
I doe not the good that I
would, and therefore I do bring
my body into ser
                              •
                           itude. Which

of vs is there, who can be
assured in this case?
                     If Dauid and Salomon, the
familiar friendes of God,
haue beene ouercome, by
the temptations of their
flesh: who is he, that will
not feare to fall, walking
vpon so slippery an yce?
                     
                        Let a widdow continually
thinke of doing seriously
the will of God, that
she may be worthy often to
heare that saying of our Sauiour
in the Ghospell: Not
those who say lord, lord, shall enter
into the kingdome of heauen, but
those who shall doe the will of my

Father which is in heauen. And
that also which he sayd in
another place: VVhy do yee cal
me Lord and Maister, and do not
the thinges I command you to do?
And againe: He that doth the
will of my Father, is my brother,
my sister, and my Mother.
                     Moreouer God sayth
by his Prophet: The Sonne
honours the Father, and the seruant
the Maister: But I am your
Father, and where is my honour?
I am your Maister, and where is
my seruice? Wherby it is manifest
that whosoeuer doth
not the will of God, nor
loues him as a Father, nor

serues and feares him as a
Lord and Maister, is (as holy
Dauid sayth) for that he is
a sinner, & hath done euil.
                     Labour, that thou
mayst be rich: but so, as the
poore may gaine thereby.
And it wilbe most pleasing
to God, if thou giue what
thou canst possibly spare to
the poore.
                     VVhensoeuer a widdow
takes her repast, let her
thinke on the poore, if she
be of ability; at least let her
giue what she can, according
to her riches, or pouerty.
And let her also think

at this tyme, that by and by
after she must fall to her
prayers, or read some good
spirituall lesson, or exercise
her selfe about some other
deuout and pious worke.
                     VVhilest a Widdow
hath meanes, let her make
vnto her selfe friendes by
Almes; that when the same
is wanting, and all spent,
they may receaue her into
the euerlasting tabernacles.
                     Giue vnto all those that
shall demand of you, if you
be able, and specially to
those who be good. Cloath
the naked, feed the hungry,

and visite the sicke.
                     Euery tyme that you
stretch forth your hand, to
giue to the poore, remember
that it is Iesus Christ to
whome you giue: and behold,
how your sweet lord,
and Sauiour beggeth, to lay
vp riches for you, against
you haue need.
                     Think often that within
a short tyme, you are to
dye, and leaue this world;
and so, you shall haue little
list to thinke of a second
worldly marriage.
                     Carry your selfe so, in
the gouernement of your

house and family, that all
may acknowledge you for
their Mistresse; and also reuerence
you for your holy
and vertuous life.
                     Fly all sorts of persons,
that haue any suspitiō of an
euil name; it is not inough
to say, My Conscience is cleer I
care not what others say of me:
but take you away all occasion
from others of thinking
ill, wherby God may
be in any sort offended.
                     Seeke first of all the
kingdome of heauē purely,
and all other thinges necessary
shall be giuen vnto you

aboundantly.
                     A VViddow ought to
flye all inordinate delights
of the sense of Tasting: and
for this cause, God would
not haue hony to be burnt
in his honor in the church,
but oyle, which comes from
the bitter Oliue-tree, and is
of an vnpleasant tast.
                     S. Paul did chastise and
afflict his body diuersly,
that he might not become
reprobate. And who will
warrant a young widdow
for her Chastity, if she continually
fill her belly with
variety of delicate viands?
                     
                        
It is not possible, that any
one now adayes should be
exempted frō the obliquy
of mens tongnes, since it is
become, as it were, a kind
of pastime among the bad,
to speake euill of the good:
but a false bruite is soone
past; and this present life of
ours, doth giue vs witnesse
of our life past. If any speake
ill of thee, amend thy
fault, and the rumour will
quickly cease.
                     Nobility, Beauty, yong
Age and Riches, make widdowes
amiable vnto euery
one; And how many more

enemyes they haue to fight
against, for the conseruation
of their Chastity; so
much more great shall be
their reward and recompence,
if they māfully resist
and ouercome.
                     Fly the company of
those widdowes, who are
widdowes not in will, but
of a kind of necessity; as also
those who liue in such sort,
that they may seeme not to
haue lost their husbands.
                     God did not send a widdow
riches to be idle, or to
spend the same vnthriftily,
but rather to the end she

might labour the more, especially
with her owne
hands, and to haue dayly
somthing to giue therof to
the poore.
                     
                        Haue continually before
your eyes, and in your memory,
this sentence: That
which you would haue to be done
vnto your selues, do you the same
vnto another.
                     Do not easily beleeue
euill of another, for this
is the property of a light &
giddy mind, which for this
reason is seldome in quiet.
                     Do not regard that which
another prayseth in thee;

but weigh and ponder the
same well with thy selfe, &
in thy owne conscience.
                     Speake little, and not
without necessity, & thou
shalt auoyde a number of
sinnes and imperfections.
                     Esteeme nothing more
amiable, or precious, then
Humility which is the keeper
& guardian of all other
vertues. And know, that
ther is nothing which makes
thee more regarded of
God and men, then Humility,
our sweet Sauiour saying:
In whome shall I repose or
rest, but in the humble?
                     
                     
                        
This Humility must not
be exteriourly faygned, nor
in wordes only; but truly
perfect, and in the hart: for
the Pride, which is turned
into Humility, is extreme
deformed: and the
vices with are couered ouer
with the veyle of Vertue,
are insupportable, & odious
in the sight of God.
                     Do not preferre thy self,
before another, eyther for
that thou art Noble, Rich,
or Fayre, or for any other
exteriour ornament of thy
body: but rather esteeme
thy selfe the more base and

abiect, therby to be truly
greater in the sight of God.
For we are all borne of the
same parents Adam & Euen,
and all redeemed with the
selfe same bloud of Iesus
Christ.
                     Do not regard the conditions
of persons, but their
affections: for their māners
and carriage make them as
well base, as noble. It is true
liberty, and noblenes indeed,
according to God, not
to be a slaue to sinne. Who
hath byn more famous or
illustrious then S. Peter, who
was euē but a poore Fisherman?

Who among women
hath been more noble then
the B. Virgin, who was neuerthelesse
espoused but to
a poore Carpenter? To this
Fisherman, God notwithstanding
gaue the keyes of
Heauen: and this humble
Virgin was made worthy
to be the Mother of God
himselfe, and her spouse
S. Ioseph his Foster-Father.
                     Haue some conuenient &
retyred place in thy house
whither thou maist repayre
often to talke & trait with
God alone, as well about
that which belongeth to

thy selfe, as to thy family.
                     Content thy selfe to haue
lost the first degree of Virginity;
& that by the third,
thou art come to the secōd:
to wit, that by the endeanour
of marriage, thou art
come to the continency of
Widdow-hood.
                     Many women whilst
their husbands are aliue,
make vowes of Chastity &
are continent. And shall not
others who are freed from
their husbands, and are become
widdowes, much
sooner performe the same?
                     God gaue thee a husbād,

and God hath taken him
from thee againe, & therby
made thee free from the seruitude
of men. Do thou
therfore rēder him due thā
                        kes
by thy chast and vertuous
liuing in widdowhood
                     Let the yong widdow,
who cannot (or rather will
not) liue chast, rather take a
husband, then the diuell.
                     Yow know by experience
how many troubles cares &
anguishes of mynd marryage
drawes with it: Now
that you haue vomited vp al
the bitternesse therof, wherfore
will you be againe

caught with the same? The
byrd, that hath once had
her foot in the limetwigs,
wil take heed for comming
there againe, I trow.
                     Make a Vertue of Necessity:
and leaue not a thing
certaine, for an vncertayne
if you be wise.
                     Take heed of the coū
                        sells
of your Nurse, and
others of your house and
family, for that they do alwayes
set before your eyes
somthing that may please
yow, and that may turne
to their owne profit & cō
                        modity.
                     
                        
If in doing well your
Father, or carnal friends be
heauy and grieued, your
Spouse Christ Iesus will
reioyce: And if your family
weepe, the Angells will
singe.
                     You do not so much belong
to those of whom you
were borne, as to him of
whome yow were regenerat,
& borne a new; redeemed
by his pretious bloud
and death.
                     Let the yong Widdow, if
her stomacke be weake, vse
a little wyne; but let her
take heed of meates that be

hoat of nature.
                     A Heathen women once
said, He that had my first loue,
was my husband: and he that hath
takē it away, let him keep it with
him still in his graue. If an Infidell
did so much dispraise
and dislike a second marriage:
what shall be expected
that a Christian widdow
should do?
                     All these sayings are of
good old S. Hierome: in gathering
wherof I haue byn
the longer, for that I hope
they wil be pleasing & cō
                        fortable
to widdows. Now
let vs see a little what S. Augustine
                        
will say vnto vs, concerning
the same subiect.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. VI. Documents for VViddowes, out of
S. Augustine.
                     THE widdow that
hath Children, ought
to bring them vp, and instruct
them in the feare of
God. And this must be her
principall care. Neither
ought she so much to glory
that she hath children, as
that she hath indeed good
and vertuous children.
                     If she resolue to keep her

dowhood, let her giue
thankes to good, who hath
by his holy inspiration,
put this resolution into her
hart, & let her in all things
praise his holy Name.
                     Let her not despise those
who haue not the intentiō
to remayne widdowes: but
let her know, that it is a
speciall gift of God; and
that he giues it to whome
he pleaseth, and in diuers
manners.
                     Let her imploy as
much tyme to please and
serue God, as she hath done
to please and serue her husband:

and by how much
the more she shall please
him, by so much more shall
she be happy.
                     Let her seeke to please
God with the beauty of her
soule, as she hath done before
to please the world
with the beauty of her body:
to wit, with her humility,
Chastity, wisedome,
loue &c.
                     In place of carnall &
worldly pleasures, let there
succeed spirituall, to wit,
prayer, reading, good
thoughtes, good workes,
frequēting the Sacraments,

hope of eternall life, eleuation
of the mind to God, &
continual giuing of thanks
to his diuin Maiesty. These
and the like are the true delights
and pleasures of a true
and vertuous Widdow.
                     Let her haue a speciall
care, that the loue of riches,
and Honours succeed
not in place of the loue of
her husband. For many
haue there beene who haue
vanquished and ouercome
the lasciuious wantonnes of
the flesh, and yet haue been
themselues ouercome with
couetousnes: and haue loued

riches so much the more
disordinatly, by how much
they haue repressed the cō
                        cupiscence,
& desires of the
flesh.
                     Let her exercise her
selfe in all true vertue, as
well in her young age as in
her old; & as much as her
health and ablenesse of body
will permit.
                     When she loues God
with her whole hart, all
kind of labour and toyle
seemes sweet and light.
And if it seeme pleasant vnto
a hūter, to follow a wild
and sauage beast, with so

great labour, toyle, yea and
danger of his life, to take
him: what should it seeme
vnto a soule inflamed with
loue, to take paynes for the
getting of God himselfe?
                     Let not a Widdow,
though neuer so rich, noble,
fayre, yea and though she
haue neuer so fayre an issue
of children, for this cause
reioyce; but accompt her
selfe as one desolate in this
world, not relying vpon
any other consolation, but
wholy vpon God; esteeming
her selfe but as a pilgrime
vpon earth, banished

into this world from her
heauenly Countrey, & subiect
to many perils, and miseryes,
a great way distant
from eternall happynes, &
most vncertaine euer to attaine
therunto: And therfore
let her lament with
King Dauid, & S Paul, who
had the like thoughts and
cogitations.
                     If she do abound in riches,
yet let her not set her
affection thereon. And aboue
all things, let her contemne
couetousnes and auarice,
the holy Scripture
saying: There is nothing more

pernicious then couetousnes, nothing
more wicked then the
loue of money; since that
for money the Couetous
man will sel his own soule.
And the Apostle sayth: That
couetousnes is the roote of all euil.
Our Sauiour also in the
Ghospell telleth vs. How
hard a thing it is for those that be
rich to enter into the kingdome of
heauen: And that a Camell, shall
ēter more easily through a needle,
then a richman into the Kingdom
of heauen. By riches are vnderstood
all earthly things,
and goods, disordinatly affected,
or sought after.
                     
                        
When a widdow hath
done her deuotions, let her
neuer be idle; let her take in
her hand either wooll, or
flaxe, let her card, let her
spinne, let her wind the
yarn that others haue spon,
let her twist it, let her see
there be no fault in the
worke, and if there be any
let her mend it, & do what
is necessary. Being thus
continually occupyed, the
longest dayes will seem very
short & pleasant: For the
soule that is idle is full of bad desires,
as the holy Scripture
insinuateth. And nothing

can be so pretious in the
sight of God, as to giue to
the poore the labour of her
owne handes.
                     Let a VViddow take
heed of adorning or attyring
her head with pearles,
Iewells, or pretious carcanets,
nor vse frizeled hayre;
for these be the true signs of
hell-fire: but let her seeke
another sorte of pretious
stones, and weare them, to
wit, Humility, Feare of
God, and other vertues; to
the end, she may buy therwith
that inestimable
pearle & margarite, Christ

Iesus the spouse of the soule.
                     Finally let a Widdow
vse discretion, maturity, &
prudence in all her actions:
let her consider who she is,
& who he is to whome she
hath consecrated her Widdowhood;
to the end she
may obtaine his earthly benediction
for her selfe, and
her children in this world,
& life eternall in the next.
                  
                  
                     CHAP. VII. Diuers memorable Examples of
true VViddowhood.
                     VVE haue spoken
already of the Famous

and glorious Widdowes
Iudith, and Anne the
Prophetesse, before the cō
                        ming
of Christ. Let vs now
set downe some other examples.
And first of all occurs
that most noble and
illustrious Roman Widdow
Paula, of whom S. Hierome
writeh, That so soone
as her husband was dead,
contemning the pompes &
pleasurs of the world, euen
in the middest of so great
wealth and aboundance of
riches, chose the state of perpetuall
Continency in widowhood.
                     
                        
                        Blesilla likewise renowned
for her beauty, wealth,
and honour, her husband
desceasing, & she being left
a young and noble Lady,
chose the holy State of widowhood,
by which she
became renowned to al posterity.
                     
                        Melania was no lesse
prayse-worthy, who when
her husband being dead, &
not as yet buryed, she caused
the bodyes of two of her
sonnes (of very great hope
and expectation, a little before
also desceased) to be
brought vnto her husbands

body, where after extreme
weeping, sighing, & drowninge
of her selfe almost
in teares, and euen loathing
as it were marriage for the
cares, troubles, & torments
that it bringes, without any
longer deliberation, consecrated
her selfe vnto God,
by vowing perpetuall Widdowhood.
                     
                        Eufrasia likewise a Roman
Lady is not inferiour
to the aboue named, whose
husband dying, she being
in her young & flourishing
age, fayre, noble, rich, contemned
a second marriage,

wherūto she was as sollicited
by the Emperour himselfe.
And so dimissing her seruants
and retinew, retyred
her selfe into Thebais, where
she liued most Saintly in
perpetuall widdowhood.
                     The same did Elizabeth
daughter to the King of
Hungary, who being depriued
of her Lord and Husband,
presently contemned
the pleasures of the Court,
and vanityes of the world,
giuing her selfe wholy to
the seruice of poore, sicke, &
needy people; not enduring
that any man besides Iesus

Christ, should be called
her Spouse, which she truly
acknowledged in the poor.
                     The noble and most
worthy example of Constantia
daughter to Cōstantine the
Great, Emperour, is admirable:
who whilest her husband
was yet liuing, deserued
to receaue the crowne
and merit of Continency.
For that her Father the
Emperour marrying her to
Halicarnus Captaine of the
Roman Army, she first perswaded
him to be a Christian,
afterward to giue ouer
the warres, to lay aside his

purple, and finally for the
loue of Iesus Christ, to
vow perpetuall Chastity.
                     The same did Chunegundis
wife to Henry the Emperour,
who perswaded him
also to liue in perpetuall
Chastity, as she had vowed
to do; whereby they both
became Saintes of Gods
Church, renowned to all
posterity.
                     Neither must we passe
ouer in silence the most
worthy and noble example
of Galla daughter to Simmachus
a Consul of Rome, whose
husband deceasing, and she

left a yong and beautifull
widdow, was so assayled
with infirmityes, that her
body became ful of botches
and soares. She consulted
with her Doctours, who
all agreed, that if she would
be cured, she must marry againe.
Whose counsell she
so much disliked, that she
sayd, She would rather endure
the same all the dayes
of her life, yea death it self,
then marry againe: which
purpose she truly obserued
most Saintly in holy Widdowhood
to her dyingday.
                     
                        
                        Ania also another Roman
Lady, and widdow of great
worth and nobility, yong,
& fayre, her husband being
dead, which he had enioyed
but a small while, was
earnestly sollicited by her
friends to a second marriage,
which she vterly refused.
Being by them demaunded
the cause why, she said. If
(quoth she) I should marry
again, & find a good hubād
like to my former, I should
liue continually in feare to
loose him by death: and
least I should chāce to light
vpon a bad husband, I will

not aduenture vpon such
a disgrace. An act and purpose
surely wise, and graue,
worthy to be considered
attentiuely by widdowes,
that desyre to liue out of
danger.
                     As nobly and prudently
did Olimpia of Constantinople,
disciple of S. Iohn Chrysostome,
and the widdow of Nebridius
Prefect of the Army, a
man of most noble Renowne,
who hauing byn
married but twenty moneths
only, was exhorted
by Theodosius the Emperour
to marry againe, since she

was both yong, fayre, noble,
rich, learned, and held
of euer one for a virgin. She
made this Answere. If my
Lord the Emperour (quoth
she) would haue me to marry
againe, why did he so
soone depriue me of my
husband (for he was slayne
in the Emperours warres)
who was so agreable to my
nature, and myne to his?
But because his Highnesse
knows me to be vnfit for a
marryed Estate, it seemes he
hath quickly deliuered me
from that seruitude: and
made me print in my hart

the delight of Continency
in widdowhood.
                     And let no man meruaile
that the continency of widdowhood
is so much recō
                        mended
to Christian women,
seing that among the
Gentills, specially the old
Romans, the same was so greatly
honoured, that when a
widdow died, her head was
adorned with a Crowne of
Continency, and to caryed
in solemne triumph to her
graue.
                     The said Romans did
also attribute another honour
to the Continency of

Widdowhood, which was,
That on the wedding day,
there were no women suffered
to come neere, much
lesse to touch the Bride, but
only such as had beene the
wiues of one husband, to
wit, such as had beene but
once marryed; cōmanding
all that had beene twice
marryed (yea though they
were Widdowes) to keep aloofe
of, as prophane, impure,
and fortelling of an
euill fortune to the happynes
of marriage.
                     They did moreouer accompt
it a signe of great intemperance

in any woman,
to marry more then once.
And for this cause one Portia
a Noble Lady being in cō
                        pany
of other Matrons and
Dames vpon a tyme; & vnderstanding
that one of thē
had beene twice marryed,
sayd vnto her: Madame, The
happy, and chast woman neuer
marryes but once. A saying
worthy of a most prudent
and wise Lady. And conforme
to this was that most
laudable fact of Cornelia,
daughter to Africanus & wife
to Tyberius Gracchus, who
when her husband was desseased,

refused a second Marriage
with King Ptolomey,
accompting it an act of too
great Intemperance so to
do.
                     And of no lesse praise &
commendation was Continency
in Widdow-hood,
held amongst the ancient
Iewes, in the old Testamēt
wherof before we haue set
downe the Examples of Iudith
& Anne the Prophetesse,
and so needlesse to be heere
againe repeated.
                     The chast Continency
also of that holy and vertuous
Widdow of Sarepta, is

not vnknowne, to whome
Meale & Oyle neuer wanted
during the tyme of that
great famine, till by gods
commandement it rayned
againe vpon the dry and
withered earth, wherby the
same became so moist and
fertile, as it filled the Countreys
round about with all
aboundance.
                  
                  
                     
                     CHAP. VIII. Of the works of Mercy, Deuotion,
Courage, and Constancy of
widdowes. And of the
Mantle, and the Ring.
                     AMONGST many,
this is not the least,
nor last pious Consideration,
that in all Countreyes
of Christendome, the noble
workes and monumēts
of widdowes are yet extāt.
Nor shall we need at this
tyme to trauaile out of our
owne Iland of England, to
view the same.
                     For it is well knowne,

that ther is scarse any Citty,
Towne, yea or Borrough
thoughout all England,
without some monument
or other, of pious widdowes.
                     For how many goodly
Hospitalls, Almes-houses
Free-schooles, yea some
famous Churches also haue
you seene built, and endowed
with sufficient rents,
& reuenews by widdowes?
How many High-wayes,
Bridges, Wels, Crosses, haue
byn made, and exected by
pious Widdowes, for the
increase of deuotion in the

people, and for the good of
their owne soules?
                     What Prayers, I pray
you, what Mortifications,
Tēperance, Night-watchinges
giuing of almes, haue
the deuout Widdowes of
our Countrey in former tymes
(and now a dayes very
many also, but yet not comparable
to the former) exercised,
for the loue of God;
taking a true delight therin
in their most Chast Widdow-hood,
to serue their
spouse Christ Iesus, whome
they had chosen insteed of
their deceased husbands?
                     
                        
How many of prime
Nobility haue we had, in
our Countrey, that haue
contemned second marriages?
And if we should recount
all, we should perhaps
surpasse the greatest
part of Christendome basides,
in that kind: some entring
into Religion and
becomming Nunnes, yea
great Saints also; & others
exercising workes of mercy
at home among the poore,
to the great comfort of the
distressed.
                     And to begin with
Queenes, how many I pray

you, haue we had in our
little Iland, that after the
death of their Lords, haue
set aside all pompe and vanity
of the world, vtterly
refusing a second marriage,
and haue either voluntarily
shut themselues vp in
Cloisters, there to spend
their dayes in prayer and
contemplation with God;
or els haue retyred to some
priuate place, continually
exercising themselues in deuotion
and meditation of
heauenly thinges.
                     Before the Conquest our
Iland was more fertile in

this kind, as being neerer to
their primitiue feruour, &
that in few ages, thē it hath
byn euer since. For within
the compasse of 500. yeares,
there haue byn aboue thirty
Queenes, that our Histories
do make mention of, to
haue made themselues eyther
Nuns in Monasteries as
is aboue said, or els haue liued
priuatly at home, continuinge
in their Chaste
widdowhood to their dying
day.
                     Of the bloud Royall,
and other Noble familyes,
the number is far greater;

neyther will it be to our
purpose in this place to recount
them all. Only this I
note, that the greatest part
of the forsaid Queens (besides
others of noble families)
were many ages ago
accoūted Saints, & for such
acknowledged throughout
Christendome; and many
Churches, Altars, and Monuments
of sanctity erected
in their honour, and their
very Names famous to all
Posterity. For to omit S. Helen
the Empresse, a Brittish
Widdow, and Mother to
Constantine the great the first

Christian Emperour, we
haue S. Ermenild & S. Ermenburge
Queenes of Mercia, or
middle Englishmē; S. Algiue
mother, and S. VVilfride wife
to king Edgar the first Monarch
of England; S. Edilburge,
& S. Ethelwide Queenes
of the VVestsaxons; S. Eadgith,
S. Ethelburge, S. Chineburge, S.
Ealflede, S. Audry Queenes of
Northumberland; S. Osith Queene
of the Eastsaxons; S. Sexburg
Queen of Kent; S. Hereswide
Q. of the Eastangles; S. Agatha,
widdow of Prince Edward
surnamed the Outlaw;
S. Margaret Queene of Scolland,

Maude the Empresse
&c.
                     All these, and very many
others, were most eniment
in piety & deuotion, both
in their widdowhood, and
continēcy: yea some of thē
vowed chastity their Lords
and Husbands yet liuing,
as S. Edilburge Queen of the
VVestsaxons, & S. Audry Queen
of Northunberland; at whose
bodyes and reliques it hath
pleased God to shew wonderous
signes, and worke
many Miracles to testify the
same; wherby they haue
byn euer since, and still are

honoured for Saints thoroughout
the world.
                     It was an ancient custome
in our Iland (and the
same continueth in some
parts of Germany vntill this
day) that in tyme of warre,
plagues, famyne, or of any
publicke necessity, there
were in many Citties and
Townes a certaine number
of widdowes ordayned to
watch & pray continually,
night and day, in the
Churches, by their turnes
or courses, one or more togeather:
because it was held,
that their prayers were of

more efficacy, and power
with Almighty God, to asswage
his wrath, then the
prayers of other common
people, as persons dedicated
wholy to his seruice, by the
obseruation of Continency,
in their Chaste, and Holy
widdowhood.
                     Neyther is the true Valour
and Constancy of deuout
Widdowes, in our
Countrey; lesse to be praised
and admired; since in that
kind also we haue gone beyond
many other Nations,
especialy in these later days,
when as their noble and

heriocall Examples heerof
haue made them famous to
posterity; whether we respect
their courage & constācy
in suffering both losse
of goods & imprisonment
for their faith and religion,
as glorious Confessours; or
els the sheeding of their
bloud in testimony of the
same, as triūphant Martyrs.
                     For vpon some of these
widdowes hath God bestowed
an inuincible courage
and fortitude, ioyned
with an admirable patiēce
in suffering for the Catholike
Cause, not only imprisonmēt

of their bodyes,
but losse also of goodes and
fortunes, to their wholy
vndoing in their temporall
estates in this world, that
they might receaue a more
plentifull reward and merit
in the world to come.
And what Catholike in
England is there, that cannot
witnesse the same sufficiently?
                     Vpon others, hath sweet
Iesus, of his infinite loue,
and superabundant Charity
bestowed a more high
and supereminent gift, not
only in suffering, as is aforsaid,

losse of goods & liberty
in this life; but also to seale
the same with their dearest
bloud, for his Names sake,
Honour, Faith, and Religion.
And this not vpon
the meanest sort, but euen
vpon some of the Bloud
Royall of England; as is well
knowne in the Lady Margaret
Plātagenet widdow, coū
                        tesse
of Salisbury, and daughter
to the Duke of Clarēce, in
time of K. Henry the 8. & in
the Soueraign Lady Q. Mary
of Scotland, Widdow, and
mother to our Soueraigne
that now raigneth; vpon

the deuout widdowes also
Ms. Marg. Clitherow at Yorke,
Ms. Anne Lyne at London, & others,
in the late raigne of
Q. Elizabeth: All giuing
their liues for the constant
profession & defence of the
Catholike Faith, & therby
made worthy of a crown of
a Martyrdom, in their holy
widdowhood.
                     
                        Of the Mantle, & the Ring.
                        IT was also an ancient
custome in England,
(which I haue not read to
haue byn practised in other
Coūtreyes) for widdowes

to weare a proper, and peculiar
vpper garmēt, called a
Mantle, by which they were
knowne, and distinguished
from other people.
                        This Mantle was a lōg,
loose Garment, which couered
them all ouer, & did
touch the ground, made of
blacke cloath ordinarily,
though others, who were
more noble, vsed them of
stuff, yet always black; signifying
therby that they wer
be accounted as dead to the
world, & to spēd the rest of
their days in mourning for
their own sins, & the sinnes

of others, for whō of their
Charity they did pray.
                        It seemes that this custome
was in vse in our Iland
long before the Conquest,
aboue 900. yeares ago. And
the first that I read of, to
haue brought in the same,
was S. Theodore Archb. of
Canterbury, sent into Englād
by Pope Vitalian, about the
yeare 660. And a little after
him againe, by S. Adelmus Bishop
of Sherborne amōgst the
VVestsaxons, who liued in the
yeare of Christ 709. of whō
it is recorded, that he gaue
hallowed Mantles to diuers,

both Virgins & Widdowes
who had vowed Virginity
& Continency: after the
taking wherof, it was not
lawfull for them to marry,
vnder payne of grieuous
sinne.
                        Afterwards, the same became
more frequent, & was
ordinarily vsed throughout
Englād, euen vntil this last
age of Schisme & Heresy in
the same. At the receiuing
wherof, were vsed diuers
pious and godly Cerimonyes:
to wit, that such
widdowes, as had for a certaine
number of yeares, liued

in Continency & widdowhood
(after the death
of their first husbāds only)
& well proued themselues
therein, receaued from the
Bishop, a hallowed Mantle,
kneeling before the high altar,
in the Church, in tyme
of solemne Masse; as also a
Ring of Gold, or Siluer,
made plaine and round, like
to a wedding-Ring, which
was also hallowed. And
this Mantle was put about
their neckes, by the Bishop
himself, he pronouncing in
the meane while, a short
prayer; as also the ring vpō
                           
their fourth finger, with a
prayer likwise pronoūced
by the Bishop. After which,
receauing the Bishops blessing,
was songe Te Deum laudamus,
in thanksgiuing; &
the widdow thus adorned
(with a veyle also ouer her
head) was led home to her
house by two graue matrōs,
and afterward held and reputed
for a sacred person, al
the dayes of her life.
                        Nor after this, was it
lawfull for her euer to marry,
or to fall from this her
pious purpose, without a
most grieuous syn, & other

Eccleasisticall punishments
ordayned for the same, hauing
once receau'd that hallowed
Robe, & Ring, as a
pledge of her faith made to
her Celestiall spouse Christ
Iesus, by so publike and
solemne a Cerimony of his
Church
                        And we read, that about
the tyme of K. Henry the
first, a widdow was seuerly
punished by the Bishop, for
marrying, after she had receaued
the Mātle & the Ring
in the manner aboue sayd.
Wherby it seemeth, that the
custome was to make some

vow of perpetuall Continency
to the Bishop, at the
receauing therof; and therby
became subiect to Ecclesiastial
power, & punishment
also, if she trangressed,
or sacrilegiously violated
the same.
                        FINIS.
