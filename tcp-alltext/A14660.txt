               RIGHT HO:
            
            
               AMONGST many worthie, and true Professors of the Gospel,

I haue presumed, and emboldened my self to dedicate this little book vnto your H
                  •…
               . view, and although not worthy your acceptation, being not done scholler-like, yet for that good wil I beare vnto the truth, and for the truthes sake, I humbly entreat your Honor to accept thereof, and howsoeuer it may seeme distastfull

vnto all disobedient and vnsanctified spirits, which haue, as Saint Iude saith, separated themselues, yet vnto all faithful Christians which truely fight vnder the banner of Iesus Christ, I know that such will not onely accept my good will, but likewise louingly and thankfully bee ready to embrace my poore indeuors herein,

seeing that I haue kept my selfe, being guided by the Spirit of God, in that sanctified place, of Christs Vineyard alone, and yet for all this I know that the malice and mischiefe of Sathan is such, that from all those haters of their brethren, who with hateful Esau, haue separated themselues, & contemned their birth-right, I expect

no better gratuitie at their hands, then deadly hate and reuenge: and my reason is this, because Grapes cannot grow vpon Thornes, nor Figs vpon Thistles. If that kingly Prophet DAVID had great cause to complaine of his times, how that his enemies were greatly multiplied, & his sorrowes much increased: by

how much more hath our most gracious King iust cause to complaine, seeing that Sathan now worketh after such a strange and most fearefull manner, by his wicked instruments, as the like was neuer heard nor seen from the beginning of the world vntill this present time; of which times Saint Paul hath truely prophesied,

should bee most perilous, & that this is true, who is he that liueth in our daies and seeth not, that prophesie, the which our blessed Sauiour fore-tolde should come to passe euen hard before his comming to Iudgement, how that it is now by the children of disobedience most fearefully working amongst ys, that

is; how that the Sunne 
               
                  Mat. 24. 29. 
               should be darkned, and the Moone should lose her light, how that the Starres should fall from Heauen, and the powers of heauen should be shaken. Againe, who is he that doth but look 
                  Mat. 24. 21. about him, and likewise seeth not, how that those immediate tribulations, the which our blessed Sauior foretold, should come to passe, euen

hard before these fearefull signes, are now alreadie finished, part of them in our late and gracious Queenes time of famous memorie, and likewise the rest of these tribulations being the greatest, in his Maiesties time, especially since his Highnesse came amongst vs? For who is hee that knoweth not, how that bloudy

               Cain, that man of sin, would not haue left one Abel aliue, if that God himself had not stood in the gap, for vs? Now for these tribulations, I doubt not, but that the very strengths of them are alreadie past, and that this most fearefull plot of Gunpowder Treason, & what else was the very last shake of the glasse.
            These and such like

persecutions and tribulations, haue at all times, and in all ages displayed themselues against the poore despised Church of CHRIST: but of all those engines which Sathan by his instruments hath deuised, was neuer the like heard of as that fearfull plot of Gunpowder, which they offered to shake vs withall, and yet behold,

most worthy Sir, there is such a fearefull shaking by the children of disobedience, now amongst vs, as for the time neuer was, nor I hope neuer shall be, untill the day of iudgment, we haue but yet spoken of the shaking of our mortall bodies.
            But behold, and yee shall see further, how that Sathan by his sharpest & most hot

instruments, doth now shake the verie powers of heauen. For Iesus Christ who now sitteth in heauen, hauing receiued all power from God his Father, is so shaken at this present time, in his wounded members, that except God of his infinite mercy vnto his little Church, had appointed and ordained our most gracious

King, as aspecial meanes to hinder Sathan in his progresse herein: I am verily perswaded, that hauing preuailed so far alreadie as hee hath done, that if hemight but bee suffered to haue his intent further, that according to our blessed Sauiours speech, no flesh should bee saued: and therefore for this cause, I

most humbly craue vppon my bended knees, that as GOD by his mighty power and loue vnspeakeable vnto his church, hath so often stood in the gap against the power of Sathan, and his most wicked instruments, to deliuer his Sacred Maiestie from so many eminent dangers, that now at last it would please his Grace, in

some recompence of so many and vn-vtterable great fauours, receiued, to stand once more in the gap for him, then as we haue had alwaies iust cause, our comforts beeing increased, and our spirits further emboldned, to cry still from the bottom of our harts, with heartie teares of repentance, vnto the Lord of Hosts, that as

hee hath so many seuerall times miraculously defended, and protected his Maiesty: so it would please him still for the great honor of his Name, and the great comfort and good of his Church, to defend & protect him still vnder the shadow of his wings, and not onely himselfe, but likewise our most gracious Queene, with that

most blessed and hopefull Progenie, that it wold so please him, to protect them all in safetie & peace, that neither the wild Bore of the Forrest, nor Esau this most wicked hunter, which hunteth cruelly within this English Pale, may euer preuaile, or take any further rooting herein: and here once againe, let no man bee offended,

that seeing this vnnaturall brother hath not only broken that vnion, which should bee amongst Christs members, and so fallen from Christ himselfe, but doth likewise dayly withdraw infinite multitudes, by his life & doctrin, to become deadly haters of their brethren, in so much that loue & charitie hath lost her sight: therefore

still vpon my bended knees, I most humbly craue, that seeing the Lord of heauen and earth is by them so greatly dishonored, it would please his sacred Maiestie, to stop the passage of these violent Hunts-men, which wilfully spoile and destroy the game: Then according to our blessed Sauiours speech, that last signe

of the Sonne of Man immediately before his last comming to Iudgement, shall more cleerely appeare, amongst the clouds; then shall there bee such cause of reioycing, as meeting Iesus Christ our Redeemer, we shall reioyce with him for euermore.
            Our blessed Sauiour saith; Hee that is not with mee, is against
               
               mee, Mat. 12. 30. And Saint Iohn saith, There are many Antichris
                     •…
                  s, whereby we know that it is the last time, I. Ioh. 2. 18. & in the beginning of the next verse, he saith, They went from vs, but they were not of vs. Now if any would know, who these specially are which are against CHRIST; and so as Saint Iohn saith, become Antichrists:

Saint Paul, Saint Peter, and Saint Iude, prophesying of these last times, plainely describe, and haue set them down by their qualities and conditions, all agreeing as it were with one consent saying, that they are spirits of disobedience, as appeareth in the thirteenth to the Romans and second verse, and in the second of Peter,
               
the second Chapter and the tenth verse: And in Iudes Epistle the eighth Verse. Now Saint Iude goeth on farther, agreeing with Saint Iohns words, and saith in the nineteenth verse, that they haue separated themselues; vpon which words of these two blessed Apostles, Saint Iohn, and Saint Iude, I gather and finde, that

there is no sect vnder the whole cope of heauen, which can so iustly deserue the title of this seuered imputation, as this Sect now resident amongst vs, commonly called Puritanes. For although the Pope of Rome is not onely a disobedient spirit, but likewise deserueth the highest roome amongst the Antichrists,

yet to say properly, hee is gone from vs, would but proue an improper speech, because hee neuer was of vs: now for this our elder brother, it may truely and properly bee said, how that hee is gone from vs, for agreeing in this word onely in Christ, may truely be said, that he was of vs. Now the question is how and

why he is gone from vs, but the question is needelesse. For who seeth not how that vaine glory and the very darknesse of his owne conceite hath so bewitched him, that as Saint Paul saith, hee hath but a shew of godlinesse, denying the power therof: 2. Tim. 3. 5. that as the dogge who had the substance but in his

mouth, seeing the shaddow in the water, snatcht thereat, and solost both; euen so hath he done: for hauing the substance no lowersettled then in his mouth, spying some outward obseruations in that waterie ayre of his owne conceit, hath leaped thereat so farre from Christ, that according to the Prophet Esayes speech, who

saith, They come neere mee with their mouth, and honour mee with their lips, but their heart is farre from mee, Esai. 29. 13. So that like hatefull Esau, hauing sold his birthright for meere vanitie, Gen. 25. 
                  •…
               4. is now become such a disobedient spirit, and so fleshly minded, as Saint Peter, and Saint Iude saith, 2. Pet. 2. 10. that he is not afraid,

to speake euil of dignities, and despise Dominion, Iude the eight verse, who resisting power as Saint Paul saith, resisteth the ordinance ordained of God, Rom. 13. 2. So that it may be gathered by these blessed Apostles, and finding it true by wofull experience, that as Saint Iohn, and Saint Iude say, he being gone

from vs, in separating himselfe, is now become such a sect, that who seeth not, how that both by his life & doctrine, hee doth nothing else, but breake that vnion which ought to bee betwixt the members of Christ? so that it may most truely bee said of him, and al the rest of this sect especially, that according to S. Iudes
               
words, They are become but wandring Starres, Iude verse 13. being as our blessed Sauiour saith, Starres fallen from heauen, Mat. 24. 29. who resting themselues in their owne imaginations, may truely be said to fall from Christ. Who hath by their disobedient practice, & euill conuersation darkened the Gospel, ment by

the Sunne, and likewise smothered loue ment by the Moone, who with their accusing and condemning Iudgements in their doctrin against the wounded members of Christ, cause the very powers of Heauen to shake, This interpretation was reueiled vnto mee by the Spirit of God: I am no Scholler at all, as your Honour

knoweth, and therefore not fit to diue into these secret mysteries: I am only a poore man, but yet not destitute of Gods Spirit, euen on whom that old prouerbe is fallen,
            None so w
                  •…
               e begone,
            As first a man, and then none.
            And therefore being in my priuate chamber, musing of the causes of the sinfulnesse

of this age, many things came into my minde, and amongst the rest, I was induced to write, and yet not knowing what to write, the spirit suggested these things vnto mee, the which I haue presumed to offer vnto your Honours view; and although vnworthy, to present such a weake thing vnto your iudicious

eye, yet for his cause who hath emboldned me, I humbly intreat and craue your honourable fauor, but to cast your eye thereon, wherein nothing can bee found, but the instruments of Sathan stil prosecuting their owne imaginations, in persecuting the poore and despised members of IESVS CHRIST, who by

their life & doctrine Gods Name is so greatly dishonored, and loue and charitie so smothered, that the Kingdome of Christ is hindered, both in particular, and in general: but as that worthy Apostle Saint Paul faith, Their madnesse beeing now euidently knowne vnto all men, I hope they shal preuaile no longer: 2. Tim. 3. 9. And thus

may your Honour see, and the whole world perceiue, how that God who sitteth aboue, hath alreadie decreed, that in despite of Pope & Puritan, and all the rest which withstand Iesus Christ & his Anointed, that his Maiestie who loueth peace, shall by Gods protection liue a peaceable time amongst vs, and as he

hath protected and deliuered him from many dangers, will continue his loue vnto him and his, and keepe them safe vnder the shaddow of his wings, and hereafter will that God of peace carrie him by his blessed Angels into euerlasting peace: vnto which peace, God of his infinite mercie, bring both you and

yours, for his honour and blessed names sake. Amen.
            
               I most humbly take my leaue, and rest at your Honors command,

                  GENTLE or vngentle Reader, I am to tell thee no strange thing, onely to tell thee of that which hath been from the beginning, which is now at this present, and which shall be vnto the worlds end; how that as Esau hated his brother

               Iacob in the beginning of the world, how that the Israel of God is hated still, and that the members of Christ shall be hated, so long as the Sunne and Moone indureth. Faithfull Christian, I was enboldened by the Spirit of G O D, to write this little Booke for thy good, it was intended chiefly for thy profit, and so many as l

                it, set down vnto thy view, not only what great danger thou art in, but likewise let thee see, how that thou mayest escape the same. And although our enemies are many in number,

and at the first sight not easily discerned, because they goe in sheepes clothing; therefore I haue set downe in plaine and few wordes, the difference of the Spirit of truth from the spirit of error, whereby thou ma
                  •…
               st truly perceiue the tree by his fruite: for he that hath a true and liuely faith in Christ, is alwaies ready to manifest the same by loue and charitie vnto

the Brethren. Now for him that saith, hee hath faith, & yet wanteth this duty of loue and charity, his faith is but a dead faith, and as Saint Iames saith, shall preuaile nothing, Iam. 5. 14. and therefore hee that doth not practise this second lesson of charitie, let him bee what hee will, and flatter himselfe neuer so much, hee is no better then a breaker of that

vnion and fellowship, which ought to bee amongst the true members of Christ; and therfore as S. Iohn saith, such is gone from vs, 1. Iohn 2. 19. being, as S. Iude saith, separated, Iude 9. verse. Promising, as S. Peter saith, libertie vnto thēselues, 2. Pet. 2. 19. Hauing, as Saint Paul saith, but a shew of godlinesse, denying the power thereof,
               
               2. Tim. 3. 5. Therfore, saith he, turne away from such. And therefore faithfull Christian, whose number is but small, let mee intreate thee, as thou tenderest thy owne soule, to be very carefull and circumspect, to keepe in this candle of loue, especially vnto thy brethren, then shalt thou haue peace of conscience in this world, and euerlasting peace in the world to come: but

deferre no time, for our time is but very short, and if thou profit any thing herein, giue God praise, and thou hast giuen me good satisfaction: and thus vnto all those that truly loue the Gospell, the Lord protect and guide with his grace. Amen.

               Well met, good brother, but mee thinke thou speakest as taking some thing offensiuely.
            
            
               Puri.
               No truely, thou art but mistaken: it is our manner to returne an answere in few words, or none at all.
            
            
               Pro.
               I did propound no question, and therefore did expect no answere, onely such salutation as thou receiuest, I expected no lesse backe againe.
            
            
               Puri.
               The same which I receiued thou hadst againe, onely the word awanting I owe vnto none, but to such as are

of the same opinion that Iam.
            
            
               PRO.
               To know what opinion thou art of, I would gladly haue some conference, for I doe perswade my selfe that thy religion is groūded more vpon a singular conceit, then approoued by the Word of God.
            
            
               Puri.
               That is not so, for wee are readie to approoue our Religion only by the Word of God.
            
            
               PRO.
               Why dost thou then denie me to bee thy brother, seeing that wee are brethren not onely of one Nation, but likewise

brethren in Christ.
            
            
               Pu.
               We may be brethren of one Nation as we are, & both confesse Christ, & yet for all this not both true members of Christ.
            
            
               PRO.
               Yet being brethren of one nation, & as it were twins of one womb, born and dwelling together, and that by one and the same profession, both acknowledge Christ; it shewes great want of charitie in the denying me to be thy brother.
            
            
               Puri.
               I doe not absolutely denie thee to bee my brother in Christ, because thou onely belecuest

in him for saluation, but seeing thy life is not strict, and being too familiar in frequenting companie, I doc not take thee to be my brother.
            
            
               PRO.
               Thou dost confesse that I am thy brother in Christ, because I hope oncly in him for saluation, but thou findest fault with me, being too familiar in frequenting companie: I would gladly knowe thy reason wherein thou art offended, seeing that my ordinarie companie is with such as do professe Christ as we both doe.
            
            
            
               Puri.
               Although thy ordinarie companie is with such as doe professe Christ as wee both doe: yet sometimes I can espie thee conuersing with a Papist, the which I ha

               PRO.
               Why, dost thou not hold it lawfull to conuerse with an aduersarie?
            
            
               Puri.
               I am so far from conuersing, that, as I said before, I hate and vtterly detest their companie.
            
            
               PRO.
               I pray thee let me aske thee a question, whether doest thou thinke, that onely those of thy profession and life shal be sau

               Thou hast made a verie idle question, for I thinke no lesse.
            
            
               PRO.
               I will then demand of thee another question, how is it possible that such as are not of thy profession, should come to bee conuerted, seeing that thou refusest to conuerse?
            
            
               Puri.
               I perceiue that thou beginnest to cauill about questions: if thou wouldeft haue my companie, thou must giue them ouer.
            
            
               PRO.
               I would be sorrie to become offensiue in the least degree, therfore

I pray thee let vs haue some further conference, & seeing that thou canst not abide to cōuerse with a Papist: yet because thou and I doe agree in this word onely in Christ, I pray thee let vs examine this faith by the word of God, because Saint Iohn saith, Beleeue not euerie spirit, but trie the spirits whether they be of God or not, 1. Ioh. 4. 1.
            
            
               Puri.
               Although I am contented that our doctrine shall bee approued by the Word of God: yet because I doe perswade my selfe that thou

art a fauourer of the Papists, therefore I make neither barrel better hearing, and therefore I hate thee likewise as a mēber thereof.
            
            
               PRO.
               Me think, brother, I find thee greatly out of charitie; for although the Papist bee foorth of the way, as I know he is, yet if my cōferring be but to bring him into the way againe: I see no reason, why thou shouldest become thus offended; it too plainly appeares that thou art much too blame.
            
            
               Puri.
               Thou mistakes

               PRO.
               Brother, thou saiest that I mistake thee, but it will appeare that thou mistakest thy selfe: for suppose that thou art in the right way to heauen, and I my selfe in the wrong: thou saiest thou louest my person, and hatest my conditions. Now whether art thou bound in loue to my person, to bring mee into the right way againe, or rather

bound to let mee alone, hating my conditions?
            
            
               Puri.
               I must of necessitie let thee alone, for I know that there is no hope in thee.
            
            
               PRO.
               Brother, here appeares but small charitie, thy answer is too peremptorie: thou mightst haue done much better, first, to haue done the part of a friend in some Christian reproof, thē seem thus to disgrace me, as being void of hope, thou hast accused me without a cause; & therfore thy error, in my iudgement, is very great.
            
            
               Puri.
               I passe not for

thy iudgement, therefore keepe thy selfe satisfied, for I am no chāgeling, as thou supposest, for what I haue spoken thou knowest, but what else, thou shalt not, therefore rest thy selfe contented.

               I am contented with any thing that is reasonable, but because thou doest wrongfully charge me to fauour any religion, but that onely which I professe; I must tell thee, brother, before we part, seeing that thou art neither conformable vnto the Law of God nor man, I say, thou art

no better then a flourishing tree without fruit.
            
            
               Puri.
               Wherein canst thou prooue me a flourishing tree without fruit, seeing that I preach the Word of God very zealously, and lead my life very strictly?
            
            
               PRO.
               I am able by the Spirit of God to reproue thee both in thy life and doctrine.
            
            
               Puri.
               As how?
            
            
               PRO.
               In thy doctrine concerning thy rashe iudgements against the members of Christ, and in thy disobedience against man, being the

principal member thereof. In a word, I am ready to reprehend thee for thy disobedience against both God and man, according to our Sauiour Christs owne words, Hee that despiseth you, despiseth mee, and hee that despiseth me, despiseth him that sent me, Luk. 10. 16.
            
            
               Puri.
               I perceiue that thou beginnest to bee angrie, but if I had better remembred my selfe, I would haue giuen thee no aduantage of my words.
            
            
               PRO.
               I looke for no aduantage in thy words:

for denying in thy practice a thing lawfully commanded, it matters not whether thou hold thy peace, or seeme to excuse it with thy tongue.
            
            
               Puri.
               Wherein canst thou disprooue mee, for any thing lawfully commanded?
            
            
               PRO.
               I can iustly reprooue thee in many things, but two or three shal be sufficient to proue thee but a flourishing tree and a wandring star: first, thy disobedience vnto eccle siasticall gouernement, which the Church

of his Land hath commanded. Secondly, thy want of charitie, hauing seuered thy selfe from Christ, in pronouncing rash and accusing iudgements against his members. Thirdly, thy contradiction against Christ, in the length of thy praiers, with the manner, and likewise of thy behauiour therein.
            
            
               Puri.
               I had thought we might haue conferred after another manner, but I perceiue now, that I haue kept thee cōpany but too long. Thou hast promised to goe forward,

therein thou maist please thy selfe: for I am pleased to turne my backe.
            
            
               PRO.
               Brother, thou hast not deceiued mee, for as Salomon saith, Ineuer tooke thee for any other, but for such a one as scornes reproofe, Prou. 9. 8. But seeing that thou hast so scornfully turned thy backe, and separated thy selfe without iust cause, denying to haue any more conference, wherein thou deseruest iustly to bee reproued; I will not faile, by Gods assistāce, to let the world see, that thou art no better,

as Saint Iude saith, Then a whithered tree twice dead, and fit to bee plucked vp by the rootes, Iude 13. v.
               
               Now, because thou shalt take no exception wherein I may offer thee the least wrong; I am ready to reprehend both thy life and doctrine, onely by example in the Scripture: and therefore let mee intreate thy patience, if thou haue any, for the thing that I ayme at, is thy conuersion, and not thy destruction. And as wee are taught in the Word of God, to reproue either friend or foe, with

the words of meekenesse: euen so, my elder brother, I am willing and ready to reprehend thee onely with the words of meeknesse and loue, and although thou doest not thinke thy selfe vnworthy of reprehension, because thou carriest thy offences behinde thee, yet seeing that others doe see that in thee which thou canst not perceiue thy selfe, I haue presumed to lay open vnto the view of the whole world, that a publike offence deserues an open rebuke.
            
            
               
LOuing and faithfull Christian, I must tell thee before I goe any further, that whereas I was determined to goe forward after a dialogue maner, thou seest here how that my elder brother hath already preuented mee; and therefore am constrained to take another course, intending, by God
                  •…
                permission, to goe forward wherein I haue promised. The Spirit of God saith, I haue chosen the foolisb things of this world, to confound the wise, and weak things to confound the
               
               mightie. Louing Christian beeing no Scholler, thou must not expect that at my hand

               iscourse of things at large, I will only point at some heads, wherin thou maist plainly perceiue the Spirit of truth from the spirit of error; and for this purpose thou must vnderstand, that there are in this land two sorts of teachers amongst

vs, the one sort is reformed, and the other sort much deformed; the one sort doth teach in Christs Schole with the words of meeknesse, the other seemeth to teach therein with the words of accusing Iudgements; the one is guided with the spirit of humilitie, the other with the spirit of iniquitie; the one with the spirit of obedience, the other with the spirit of disobedience; the one teacheth, and resteth himselfe in the schole of Christ, the other maketh but a proud flourish

            And first, against the spirit of errour, our blessed Sauiour himself, Saint Paul, Saint Peter, Saint Iohn, and Saint Iude, with others, hauing prophesied of these very last times, wherein we liue, doth tel vs in plaine words the qualities and conditions of such false prophets as are now resident amongst vs. And now to our elder brother, to whom I must

tell thee before I proceede, that seeing it is a thing subiect to flesh and bloud, not onely to passe ouer offences vnto others from themselues, but likewise imputeth many faul

               and stand in their owne conceit, not fearing to speake euill of dignities, 2. Pet. 2▪ 10 Herein I know, that the Church of Rome, iustly and worthily deserues this imputation. Now, who is so blind, and seeth not, how that thou likewise art not onely fleshly minded, and despisest dominion, as S. Iude saith, but likewise agreeable vnto Saint Pauls words, resistest the ordinance ordained of God, Rom. 13. 2. And to proue this further, bec
                  •…
               use thou art ready to take exception without cause, S. Peter speaking of

the Ministery, doth seeme to teach thee thy dutie both to superiour and inferiour Magistrates: his words are these: Submit your selues vnto all manner ordinance of man for the Lords sake, 1. Pet. 2. 13. And in the verse going before, he giues a reason why the words are these, That they which speake euill of you, as of euill doers, may by your obedience, which they shall see, glorifie God in the day of visitation: therefore, saith hee, submit your selues, 1. Pet. 2. 12.
            This word ordinance, is quoted in some Bibles

onely of ciuill gouernement: but I appeale vnto the iudicial censure of the learned, whether that Caesar hath his whole right herein or not: I hope there is not any that hath the Spirit of God, but they wil confesse that our gracious King is as well supreme Head and Gouernor ouer all causes Ecclesiasticall, as Ciuill. Now this word ordinance being guarded with these two words, all manner, I see no reason, in my iudgement, of any lesse importance then both spirituall and temporall: and I

thinke I haue also the spirit of God. But now to the point: our gracious King hauing commanded many things to bee obserued in this Church of England; and yet, as Saint Paul saith, nothing but that which is agreeable vnto the Word of God, being both decent and comely, I would very gladly know thy reason why thou shouldest shew thy selfe thus disobedient. Salomon saith, A diuine sentence shall be in the lippes of the King: his mouth shall not transgresse in iudgement, Prou. 16. 10.

Brother, heere thou standest in thy owne conceit, and thinkest, that no King in the world is so wise as thy selfe: Ergo, thou wilt refuse gouernment, which doth inferre, that thou despisest the Gouernour. Wilt thou see a samiliar example by a plaine cōparison, how contrary thou art to Christs command, who saith, Giue vnto Caesar, that which is Caesars, Mat. 22. 21 Amongst the temporall Lawes of this Land, it is commanded, that the poore therein shall bee k

their seuerall Parishes. Now som sturdy beggers there be, which will not submit themselues vnto this command, but being guided by their own conceit, wander abroad, making themselues no better then Rogues by the Statute: of which sort, Saint Paul saith, If they will not worke, they must not eate, 2. Thes. 3. 10. Brother, what sayst thou of this disobedient begger? or how likest thou of Saint Pauls prescription of this sturdy Rogues diet? or what dost thou thinke of this example

by thy s

               d thee; & therfore as this sturdie begger is become a rogue by the statute of this land, so thou being a conceited obstinate, hast made thy selfe by the statute of God, no better, as S. Iude saith, then a wandering starre, whose dyet, without repentance, S. Paul hath likewise set downe in the 13. to the Rom. and 2. verse.
            If thou bee put to silence,

Now this is such a crie, as may become a wonder vnto the world, who seeth thee in the very height of disobedience: shall a father command his childe that thing which he may very easily doe without any danger at all? and shal this childe refuse his fathers command, & pleade not worthie correction,

because hee is his childe? this thou wilt confesse is very absurd: how canst thou then excuse thy selfe? dost thou think that thy disobedience vnto our gracious King being contrary vnto CHRIST himself, & his command, to pleade the Lords anointed, because thou preachest Christ; therfore worthy no correction nor punishment? why this is too absurd: nay Brother, flatter not thy selfe, for before we part, I feare me that thou wilt proou

Otherwise what may bee expected, but a casting away of your selues, as of the whole seede of Ephraim, Ier. 7. 15?

               iudgement, or any such like things which wicked Kings doe, Esai. 10 1, 2. then mightest thou haue had iust cause to complaine, and we al cause to lament. But seeing hee is so merciful, and so louing vnto all his subiects, commāding nothing but that which is agreeable vnto the word of God: who art thou, and what a contradicted spirit art thou of, that in stead of loyall dutie and loue, art become thus disobedient vnto so louing and gracious a King?
            But alas, what hast thou

done? Hast thou not with all those disobedient spirits in the old Testament, transgressed most fearefully against both God and good men? nay further, thou hast swerued from the cōmandement of Christ: Matth. 22. 21. and as Saint Paul saith, resisted the ordinance ordained of God▪
                Rom. 13. 2. striuing against principalities and powers, Titus 3. 1. speaking, as S. Peter saith, against dignities, 2. Peter 2. 10. despising dominion, lude the 8. verse: boasting thy selfe, as Salomon saith, before the King, Pro. 25. 6.

in a word thou hast in the very height of pride, transcended thy selfe aboue all power, exalting thy selte aboue measure. And now what may be expected, thinkest thou, without a speedie and sodain repentance, but such a most fearefull fall for this thy disobedience; as Saint Iude hath alreadie prescribed, euen blacknesse and darknesse for euer: Iude the 13. verse?
            Brother, I will shew thee such an ensample of obedience, that if there be but one spark of grace in thee, thou wilt neuer

deny to follow him: For behold our blessed Sauiour himselfe, although a free-man frō all Subsidies or Taxes, or what else which was due vnto Caesar, by strangers, yet, rather then he would seeme to disturbe a common peace, or become an example of offence in the least degree, he commanded Peter to cast his angle into the water, and the first Fish, saith hee, thou takest, open his mouth, wherein thou shalt finde a piece of Siluer of twenty pence, take it, and pay for mee and thee, Mat. 17. 25, 26. verses.
            
            
               
Thou seest heere how willing and ready our blessed Sauiour was in Obedience in his owne person; thou seest him pay tribute vnto Caesar, although a free-man; nay, further, rather then hee would becom an ensāple of the least offence, thou maist perceiue him yeelding vnto a base Publican. Now if our Sauiour Christ did not think that ciuill policie was taken away by the Gospell: what may the whole world thinke of thee, in denving obedience, refusing but rites and ceremonies,

which are seemly in the Church, beeing lawfully commanded. I am sory to see thee moūt thy selfe into this verie height of pride: thou art become little inferiour vnto those disobedient spirits, that for their pride 2. Pet. 2. 4. fell from Heauen to Hel. Thou hast, as the Prophet D

                  Psal. 120. verse 5. 
               am constrained to dwell in Mesech, and to haue my habitation
               
               in the Tents of Kedar. And thus thou hast, by thy disobedient inchantments, caused such a contention in this Land, that thou hast iustly deserued with Mesech and Kedar, those Israelites, (which did degenerate from their godly Fathers, beeing hatefull and contemning the faithfull) that most fearefull Iron rodde of Gods wrath, to bruise thee in pieces sodainely.
            I must tell thee, Brother (and I am sorry that thou hast giuen mee such iust cause to tell thee so)

that if it were not for one crying sinne which that bloody and wandering Cain is branded in the fore-head withal, I meane that most monsterous Beast of Babylon, who denyeth the Offices of our Redeemer: I say, and speake it from the Spirit of God, that thou art become so little inferiour in persecuting and murdering the soules of Christs members; that thou hast not onely pledged the Pope of ROME a full health of the dregges of your conceited inuentions, and false imaginations,

but as thou hast pledged him herein. I feare me it will proue before wee part, that thou hast begun another halfe pot to him againe. And although thou doest not runne on with him in deniall of some fundamentall points of Religion, yet I dare vndertake, that thou resting thy selfe in thy owne conceit, denying but the circumstances & shaddowes therof, whose substances cannot bee without, dost more hurt by thy disobedience amongst vs herein, then he doth, or can doe, being

so publikely knowne as hee is. And here as our Sauior Christ saith, Thou art but a blind guide, which straines out a gnat, and swallows a Camell, Mat. 23. 24.
            Thus, Brother, thou carriest this offence of disobedience vpon thy back, and therefore thou canst not perceiue it thy selfe. Now I haue made bold, comming behinde thee, to take it off, & haue layed the same) as thou now seest) before thy face: For which, if thou wouldst so keepe there, and cast it no more behinde thee, I shall be glad

that it was my chance to remoue the same.
            But if thou rest thy selfe in thy owne conceit, casting obedience from thee, and so become a carrier still of thy offences behind thee, then wilt thou enforce mee, to say with Salomon: That there is more hope in a very naturall foole, then of him that is conceited, Pro. 26. 12. ver. And this shall serue for a taste of thy disobedience, and to let the world see, That as Saint Iude saith; Hauing separated thy selfe from the true members of Christ, thou art become

no better then a wandring Starre, whose portion without repentance, is blacknesse of darknesse for euer, Iude 13. vers.
            
            And therfore, Brother, let mee aduise thee to learne a lesson of that Starre which guided the Wise men from the East Countrie, vnto Bethlem, where our blessed Sauior Mat. 2. 9. CHRIST was, & as that Star did stand still, when it came iust ouer where the Babe was, and so left them there: so thou who doest rest thy selfe but in thy owne conceit, denying obedience vnto supreme

power, let it now be sufficient, & too much, that thou hast settled thy affections, in that East countrie of thy owne imaginations, where nothing can bee found but Inchanters and Sorcerers. And heere I must leaue thee, and turne my self vnto those, of whom, as Saint Paul saith, I perswade my self better things, Heb 6 9. And thus, faithfull Christian, thou seest what great danger the children of disobedience haue broughtthemselues into. Thou seest that our elder brother, for his disobedience,

is counted no better in the iudgement of Saint Iude, then a wandring Starre. Thou seest what such haue prescribed in the Scriptures for their diet, after this life: S. Paul saith, condemnation, Rom. 13. 2. Saint Peter, and Saint Iude saith, blacknesse of darknesse for euer. 2. Pet. 2. 17. Iude the thirteenth Verse. Thou seest these blessed Apostles so speaking against these disobedient spirits, as worthy of these fearefull iudgements. And in briefe, thou seest how truely these holy Apostles

hath prophesied of these disobedient spirits, in these very last times. And againe, thou seest how opposite these spirits are vnto the obedience of our blessed Sauiour Christ himselfe, who paied Tribute vnto Caesar in his owne person: who rather then hee would bee an ensample of the least offence, although a freeman, yeelded himselfe vnto a base Publican. And thus may all men see, the King of all Kings, an ensample of obedience vnto the whole world.
            
               
And yet behold, heere thou seest a disobedient spirit so full of contradiction, that hee will transcend aboue principalities and powers. But faithful Christian, let this fearefull example be such a speciall warning vnto thee, that thou keepe thy selfe in all loyall obedience vnto Princes especially: and likewise let this example bee a warning vnto all sorts of people, that they yeeld obedience vnto whom soeuer it is due. As Children to Parents, and Parents to their Children: Wiues to
               
               their Husbands, and Husbands to their Wiues: Seruants to their Masters, and Masters to their Seruants, Col. 3. 18, 19, 20. And in a word, al in general to our most gracious King.
            Now that we may the better performe these duties, let vs take counsell of that blessed Apostle St. Paul, who speaking against such disobedient spirits, saith, Turne away from such, 2. Tim. 3. 5.
            And thus, faithful brother, thou seest what danger our elder brother hath brought himselfe vnto, in despising gouernment.
            
               
It resteth now in the second place, to let thee see his disobedience in his doctrine, and as in briefe thou seest his disobedience against man, thou shalt likewise, by Gods assistance, see his disobediē
               
                  •…
               e against both God and man, who perseeuteth Christ in his members: both thou and I haue felt the smart: but faithfull brother, I must leaue thee for a while.
            And now, brother, by Gods assistance, according to my promise, I am readie to encounter with thee this second

time. And wheras I haue already reproued thee for thy disobedience against man, not finding thee in this Combate to yeeld; beeing prouoked further, I am readie to manifest vnto the whole world, how contrarie thou art to Christ and all good men, by thy disobedience in thy Doctrine. Likewise shewing the difference betwixt the Spirit of truth and the spirit of error. But before I proceede, I am to meete with an obiection, which the whole world, who being against the truth,

may propound, and that is where the true Church of Christ is, and therefore to giue satisfaction herein, the world shall vnderstand that both the true Church and the false is in this little Iland, called England: and as there are many false Churches in the world, and but onely one true: The world may likewise perceiue, that as the true Church of GOD is alwaies accompanied, as Saint Paul saith, with some heresies for the better triall thereof, 1. Cor. 11. 19. So now especially is it at

this present time, for there are three sorts of Teachers amongst vs, whereof one of these is the true Church of Christ, and the other two with all the rest, doe but oppose themselues. Now of these two latter being both false, the one of them doth teach in priuate, the other doth preach in publike. Now for this priuate teacher, it is needelesse to speake any thing of him, seeing that the Church of God doth know him sufficiently, how that he degrading Christ of his Offices,

challengeth such prerogatiues vnto himselfe, as are onely peculiar vnto Christ, and therefore no true member thereof.
            And as this priuate teacher is a knowne enemie vnto Iesus Christ: so likewise, I am readie to prooue by the Word of God, that thou, who restest in thy owne conceit, hauing separated thy selfe from thy brethren, being become a rash accusing iudger of them, that thou art so farre off from being either a teacher, or a scholer,

in the Schoole of Christ, that thou art an enemie thereunto, teaching onely in the vanitie of thy owne imagination. And that this is true, our blessed Sauiour, seeming to teach the whole world the way vnto the Kingdome of heauen, hath erected vnto the view of the whole world, a large free Schoole, wherein he teacheth that whosoeuer would bee a teacher, or a scholler therein, must learne this lesson of meekenesse and lowlinesse, Matth. 11. 29. And lest his children

should swerue or goe astray from this his milde Commandement: hee giues a speciall warning in the sixth Chapter of Saint Lukes Gospell, and thirtie seuenth verse, in these words: Iudge not, that yee bee not iudged: condemne not, and yee shall not be condemned: forgiue, and yee shall be forgiuen, Luk. 6. 37.
            Now there are diuers and sundrie sorts of people, which doe perswade themselues, that they are true teachers in this schoole of Christ, which indeed are not: and therfore

to resolue a doubt which may either arise in th

               ripture, that the ignorant may not onely be better satisfied, but likewise, that their vnderstādings may be more apt to conceiue of things afterwards. And for this purpose, Saint Iohn saith, Trie the Spirits, whether they bee of God, or not, 1. Ioh. 4. 1. and in the next verse he saith, Heereby shall yee know the
               
               Spirit of God: Euery spirit which confesseth, that Iesus Christ is come in the flesh, is of God, 1. Ioh. 4. 2.
            Now heere thou must take heede, how thou vnderstandest these words: if thou take them litterally, as the Papists doe in the sixt Chapter of Saint Iohns Gospell, concerning the Sacrament, then thou art in an errour: for thē not only the Papists, but specially the Puritan, with diuers other sects, should receiue benefit by Christs death; which being rightly vnderstood, thou maist plainly perceiue,

that they haue no right nor interest therein. For they that degrade Christ of his offices, as the Papists doe, or seeme to to seuer that vnion betwixt Christs members, as the Puritan doth▪ doe separate themselues, both from Iesus Christ and h
                  •…
               s members. And therfore to cleare this point, before I proceede, the Prophet Esay saith: This people come neere me with their mouth, and honour me with their lippes, but their heart is farre from me, Esa. 29. 13 And our blessed Sauiour saith) Not euery one that
               
               saith vnto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the Kingdom of heauē: but he that doth the will of my father which is in heauen, Mat. 7. 21. And to make this more plaine, our Sauiour Christ saith further, Many will say vnto mee in that day, that is, the day of Doome, Haue wee not prophesied by thy name, and by thy name cast out deuils, and by thy name done many great workes? yet for all these outward actions, wanting loue and charitie vnto the members of Christ, thy answer shall be, Depart from me, thou worker of iniquitie, I
               
               know thee not, Mat. 7. 2 3. So that wee see by these proofes, that it is not an outward profession only, which God requireth, but likewise an answerable conuersation. But now to the purpose.
            And whereas thou perswadest thy selfe to bee a Teacher in the Schole of Christ, the world shall plainly see, that thou dost but flatter thy self in thy owne imagination, being quite contrarie minded to the true teachers therin. And that this is true, I will first set down a true disciple, and a follower

of Christ, who according to our blessed Sauiours commaund, approouing himselfe both in his life and doctrine, teacheth with the spirit of humilitie and patience, as appeareth by that blessed Apostle Saint Paul, who speaking of himselfe, and all true Teachers in this Schole of Christ, saith in these words: Wee giue no occasion of offence, that our Ministerie should not be repreh
                     •…
                  nded, 2. Cor. 6. 3. but in all things wee approue our selues, as the Ministers of Christ, in much patience, 2. Cor. 6. 4. And lest others

should mistake thēselues, who are to deale sometimes with such an aduersarie, as doth oppose himselfe against the truth, he likewise aduiseth Timothie; To instruct such with the words of meekenes: and hee hath set downe a reason why; for per aduenture God may give them repentance, 2. Tim. 2. 25.
            Now Brother, whether thou art a Teacher after this manner, or but a Teacher after thine owne conceit, I appeale vnto such words as flow from thy fierie spirit of accusing Iudgements,

and likewise from such fruit as doth appeare by thy general doctrines: for powring forth the Wine of Gods iustice in such fearefull manner, against the wounded members of Christ as thou doest, reseruing the oyle of Gods mercies, without due consideration vnto thy selfe: what is this, but to feede thy own idle and most absurd conceit, making beames in thy brothers eyes, and but motes in thy owne?
            Heerein thou makest thy selfe no better then a plaine hypocrite, as appeareth

by our Sauiour Christ, saying in these words; Hypocrite, first cas

                we should

not iudge of others: For, saith hee, thou that iudgest others, thou condemnest thy selfe, Rom. 2. 1. Now how contrary thou art to Icsus Christ, and to his followers, doth appeare by the fruits of thy doctrin, who by thy accusing and condemning iudgemēts, hast not only caused many to fall from Christ vnto desperation, which is most fearefull, but likewise for all the rest which take liking to the same, which are infinite in multitudes, & are becom such deadly haters of their Brethren, euen vnto that

height of sinne, that they blush not to make good their hateful minds by the Scripture, the place they alleage, where Dauid by a 
                  Psal. 139. most prophetical spirit against the enemies of God being bloud-thirsty men, desired God not only to slay those wicked people, but h

self and those thy followers doe thus interpret, is hatcht and fetcht frō the deuill, and thy deuillish conceit: for seeing thou canst neuer proue thy self to be of that Spirit which D
                     •…
                  uid had, nor likewise canst neuer proue vs thy Brethren, to deserue such imputation, which those manslaiers the 
                  〈◊〉
                of God did; how impudent and cruell art thou aboue measure, to censure and iudge thus vncharitably against the members of Iesus Christ? Again, many of thy followers goe further, and say, that of their

owne Parents, being Protestants, that they are already damned, and that this is too true by wofull experience, many places of this Land, with the place where Idwell, doe manifest the same. That blessed Apostle S. Paul saith, Let your patient mind be knowne vnto all men, the Lord is at hand, Phil. 4. 5. But thou by a contrarie spirit, sayst vnto thy followers, Let your hatred and malice bee knowne vnto all men; and therefore thou hast iust cause to thinke that the Deuill is at hand. This thy hatred

hath so spred it selfe throughout the whole land, that it cannot bee denied without a brazen face: and that this is true, I can shew thee an instance of experience offered against my selfe: for taking occasion, being moued by the Spirit of God, as now to write this little booke, I writ my letter vnto a principall man of thy sect, and although reproouing him after a friendly manner, his rage was so kindled thereat, that his answere was, that if he liued, hee would reuenge it: but if hee died,

let GOD reuenge it. Againe, another of thy Sect standing by, did giue mee such cruell and disgracefull wordes, that nothing did appeare but hatred and malice. And amongst the rest of his speeches, for writing that Letter, hee iudged mee worthy to die some sodaine death. I haue noted these words, that the world may see what spirits the Diuell doth hatch in these very last times: and likewise to let all men see how contrarie thou and thy Sect are vnto Iesus Christ and

his followers, who from the spirit of humilitie doth teach with patiēce, beeing so farre off from reuenge, that they are alwaies ready to forgiue their enemies.
            Saint Iude speaking against disobedient spirits of authoritie, saith, That their rage is such, that they fome out their owne shame, Iude the thirteenth verse. And that this is true of thy Sect, one of thy Brothers hath alreadie spoken his malice against one of the chiefest pillars of this Land: and I will tell thee how, taking exception

against a poore man, but for a supposed fault, got him bound ouer vnto the Sessions, where his proofe failed: but being not satisfied, the poore man was troubled further, where thy brothers proofe failing the second time, to satisfie his reuenge further, another Iustice warrant was sent for. Now the poore man being in the fire twice before, beeing driuen into great distresse, he bethought him of a friend at London: therefore he went trudging vnto him, & made his case knowne:

and beeing truely perceiued, appearing more malice thē matter, his friend procured a Supersed
                     •…
                  as for him, vpon bayle giuen for his good behauiour, as the vsuall manner is: so that hee tooke his leaue, and came trudging home againe: and he no sooner approched, but intelligence was giuen, and needelesse to bid thy brother prosecute; this warrant must presently be serued.
            But the Constable perceiuing & seeing a Supersedeas, made it knowne. Wherupon thy brothers

rage beeing kindled, to please the pride of his humour, writ his Letter vnto the Iustices Clarke after this manner.
            Friend, whereas a warrant was directed from your Master, against such a one, it wil take no place, for hee hath gotten a Su

                  ersedeas: I thinke hee hath beene at the Pope, and gotten a Pardon for his sinnes past, and to come: And that this is true, there is sufficient testimonie to proue the same.
            I haue noted this. First, to discharge my conscience,

who ought not to keepe such words secret. Secondly, that the world may perceiue, how that pride & vaine-glory with an inuetered malice, doth so raigne in the children of disobedience, thatthey are ready likewise to burst forth into cursed speeches against Principalities and Powers. O wick
                  •…
               d generation aboue measure! what may bee expected at thy hands, if thou shouldst be suffred, and mightst but haue thy owne will, that from thy disloyall disobedience, and rash accusing Iudgements,

such fruits as these doe spring? there doth nothing appeare in thee but disobedience, rash accusing Iudgements, hatred and malice, and cruell reuenge, and all against the poore members of Iesus Christ, whose number by thy inchanted doctrine thou hast so diminished, that those of thy hatefull sect are growne infinite in multitudes. Thou hinderest the fruits of the Gospel: Thou causest the Ministerie to be euill spoken of, thou resistest the truth, by setting vp an Idol of thy owne imagination,

thou art so deepely plunged in the depth of thy owne conceit, that as Salomon saith, There is more hope in a foole then in him that is conceited. Prou. 26. 12. Thouhast giuen vs great cause to complaine, as Saint Paul did of Alexander the Copper-Smith, Thou hast done vs much hurt. But as he said, I trust the Lord will reward thee thereafter. 2. Tim. 4. 14. And yet for al this, although thou hast caused Gods Name greatly to be dishonoured, and loue and charitie smothered, notwithstanding all this,

thou art still readie with those conceited Iewes, who cryed, The Temple of the Lord, to excuse thy selfe and say, The Lords Anointed, the Lords Anointed. Now if it were not, that the god of this world had bewitcht thy thoughts, thou wouldst blnsh for shame to make such a cry amongst them, which know thee better then thou knowst thy selfe.
            Suppose thou couldst speak, as S. Paul saith, with the tong of men & Angels, & haue not loue, thou art no better then sounding brasse
               
               or a tinckling Cimbal, 1. Cor. 13. 1. Thou saiest thou preachest Christ, it is true: And as Saint Paul saith, I reioyce thereat. But what of this, seeing that thou hast not onely separated thy selfe, from the body of the Church, but likewise wantest humilitie, patience, and charitie, thou doest no better then the same Apostle saith, Then preach Christ of enuie and contention, Phil. 1. 15. If thou wouldst giue vs cause to reioyce with S. Paul, how that thou preachest Christ as thou doest: thou must get thy

selfe to Virginia, or some other place where Christ was neuer heard before, where (no doubt) their good workes far exceede thine: then would be iust cause of reioycing, where Gods Name would become greatly more honoured, and they, and we both, more comforted. But to stay heere like an vnskilfull Physicion amongst the wounded members of Christ, powring in the wine of Gods Iudgements, reseruing the oyle of Gods mercies vnto thy selfe, I will vndertake, whereas thou

curest one soule, thou killest a thousand, so that in stead of reioycing, there is nothing to be expected from thee, but iust cause of great sorrow: & therefore, as Saint Paul saith, We haue good cause to refuse thy company, 2. Tim. 3. 5.
            Saint Iohn saith, If wee walke in the light, as hee is in the light, wee haue fellowship one with another, and the blood of Iesus Christ his Sonne, clenseth us from all sinne, I. Ioh. 1. 7.
            Brother, thou beleeuest that the bloud of Iesus Christ the Sonne of God, doth clense vs from

all sinne. And thou canst not deny, but that I beleeue the same. Now a question may arise, wherin are wee separated, and whether of vs haue separated our selues? I haue alreadie shewed the difference herein sufficiently. For the tree is known by his fruit. But I will tell thee, Brother, if that thou hadst looked as seriously, and stayed thy self in the beginning of this verse, as thou hast done in the latter end, thou mightst better haue perceiued, not onely who it is, that goeth about to

breake this vnion which is betwixt Christ and his Church, butlikewise who it is that doth separate themselues herein.
            This Verse is sufficient to confute and confound both the Pope of Rome, and thy selfe, the latter end is sufficient to confute him, & the fore-end sufficient to confound thee: he hath cut off himselfe in denying that the blood of Christ doth clense vs from all sinne: and thou hast cut off thy selfe, beeing separated from the fellowship of thy brethren, according

to Saint Iohns words, Hee that hateth his brother, is in d
                     •…
                  rkenesse, and walketh in da

                  〈◊〉
               .
            I haue sufficiently shewed how that thou hast not onely separated thy selfe from vs, but likewise prooued by the fruit of thy accusing Iudgements, how that both thou and thy followers are become deadly haters of thy brethren: and thus the world may plainely see, how that by hating ofvs, thou

art become, as Saint Paul saith, Onely a louer of thy selfe, 2. Tim. 3. 2.
            Our blessed Sauiour saith, Blessed are the meeke, far they shall inherit the earth, Ma
                     •…
                  th. 5. 5. Vpon these words I gather, that thou art but an intruder in thy calling, and liuest by the sweate of other mens browes: that as the wandring and sturdy begger doth eate the bread of others: so thou beeing but a wandring Starre, and impatient, doest eate the bread of thy brothers. Thou preachest long Sermons,

and often: therein I blame thee not: it is the manner only that marres all: for in steade of that fierie Spirit of zeale and sinceritie of the heart to preach Christ in loue and humility: thou preachest Christ in accusing and condemning iudgements with the fiery spirit of iniquitie. And heere thou makest the verie powers of heauen to shake, Matth. 24. 29.
            But Saint Paul being of a contrary spirit, saith, To the weake I become as weake, that I may win the weake: I am made all things
               
               to all men, that I might win some, 1. Cor. 9. 22. Saint Paul heere, to winne men vnto Christ, did not respect these outward things of indifferencie, but is content to obserue all times, and to eate and drinke with all sorts of people, to winne some vnto God. And for this ende, our Sauiour Christ was content to debase himselfe, To conuerse, and to eate and drinke with Publicans and sinners, Luk. 5. 29. But thou, who scornest all company but those of thy owne sect, Bindest heauie burdens, and
               
               layest them on mens shoulders, but as for thy selfe, thou wilt not mooue them with one of thy fingers, Matth. 23. 4. Thou, like the proud Pharise, preachest the Law very strictly: and thou seemest in outward shew to goe before vs; and if wee doe not make an outward appearance as thou doest, then presently thou entrest into vncharitable iudgement of condemnation; and yet who seeeth not, how fleshly-minded thou art, both in thy wordes and deedes? and how thou temptest
               
               God to lay a yoke on the Disciples neckes, which neither our Fathers, nor wee, are able to beare, Acts 15. 10. Beeing contrarie to Christs words, who saith, My yoke is easie, and my burden light, Matth. 11. 30.
            Saint Paul saith, Who art thou that iudgest thy brother? or why doest thou set thy brother at nought? we must all appeare before the Iudgement seat o
                     •…
                   Christ, Rom. 14. 10. Herein thou hast caused vs with Saint Paul, to bring thy name in question, and to say, Who art thou? as though wee knew thee not: but

the truth is, wee know thee but too well, for we finde thee altogether, as Saint Paul saith, Without naturall affection, 2. Tim. 3. 3. But alas, what hast thou done in iudging thus vncharitably? Thou hast done no lesse then ioyned thy selfe with the Pope of Rome, who is ready to iudge all, but will be iudged of none; and therefore making thy selfe hayle fellow well met with him, thou hast with him and all the rest of the whole world, which doe oppose themselues against

the LORD and his Anointed, yeelded your selues so farre vnto the vanitie of your owne imaginations, that yee wilfully haue drowned your selues in the redde sea of Iudgements.
            And thus I haue let thee see, first, thy disobedience: secondly, thy impatient and accusing iudgements, wherein the world may plainely perceiue, how that nothing doth proceed, nor can be gathered from them, but contention, enuie, hatred, and such inuetered malice, that thereby thou

hast caused the Sunne to be darkened, the Moone to lose her light, and the very powers of heauen to shake. In a word, thou hast iustly caused Gods most sacred name so greatly dishonored, that without a very speedy and suddaine repentance, thou shalt haue for thy better satisfaction, as Saint Paul saith, such a recompence of reward, as is prescribed in these two wordes, Indignation and wrath, Rom. 2. 8
            Now Brother, concerning these thy most cruell iudgements against

the members of Iesus Christ, which are now liuing, thou hast not contayned nor contented thy self h

               rein. For one of thy Sect, taking occasion in a publike Sermon, to speake of the yong man in the Gospell, who came to our blessed Sauiour Christ, to know what hee might doe to inherit eternal life, Mark. 10. 2
                  •…
               . Hee affirmed before the company of many hundred persons, that this yong man is a damned soule in Hell. I know there was Hypocrisie found in him: and who can say, hee is

free heerein? But seeing that our blessed Sauiour, who answering an obiection of his Disciples, said, Although with, men it seeme vnpossible, yet with God no hing is impossible: and againe, for those many good parts the which Iesus Christ said, that hee loued him for; I gather that hee is in a farre more happie case, in my iudgement, then thou, whosoeuer thou art that iudgest thus vncharitably of him.

               licious humour, and to disgrace the Officer, hee said, in a publike speech, being in the Pulpit, that hee was a Cadauerous Knaue: implying, that a Tinker, or a Pedler, might find more fauour, and haue no such questions put vpon them; and for want of matter, hee said, that God made all, but the Deuill would

haue all: but heerein hee equiuocated; for he ment all but those of his sect, and being too bold, and too impudent for such a place, he said in a verie peremptorie passion, that if hee had spoken any thing which might seeme preiudiciall, the Law was open, his name was knowne, and likewise where hee dwelt: and in conclusion of all, without exception, hee said, that hee cared for the face of no man.
            Againe, thy followers vsing their exercises after thy Sermons, in the

Church, some one of them stands vp, to speake, and expostulate of things that haue beene spoken before, and to the number of an hundred, or more, or lesse, doe attend him. Now, after thy Sermons, whatsoeuer is spoken, all are well pleased: but if it chance, that a reformed Minister; nay, let it bee the Bishop himselfe, then the leafe must bee turned ouer, to see, whether that Lots wife looked back only in her head, or in her heart, or in both; and heere they are at odds,

and cannot agree. These followers of thine are the silly ones of this age: they are Buckes of the first head, they haue very pregnant wits of indiscretion, they thinke that none can bee saued but such as vse these their outward obseruations. We know them when we meet them, for they haue no good morrow for vs: but wee know them better, when wee bargaine with them; for then their sound horse prooues lame. This feminine kind are very silly and louing creatures, seeming very

deuout, although very ignorant: for after thy after-noone Sermon, some Gentlewoman or other must in treat a Sermon after supper. Now thou, who cāst preach without studie, hauing no power to deny, this deuout company, with thy sel

in thy sight proues a present beame; and therfore thou saist damnable. But whatsoeuer thou doest, in thy own sight it seemes good: but whatsoeuer I doe, in thy sight it is naught. Now the reason is, as Saint Iohn saith, because darkenesse hath blinded thy eies, 1. Ioh. 2. 11. These are children of thy owne begetting; here is like Priest like people. But wilt thou heare what comes of thy darke sermons? I would not omit to tell it, although I take no pleasure therein. A Gentlewoman, who seeming

very deuout, being one of the chiefest followers of that sexe, and whom no occasion might hinder to follow thee tenne miles or more to heare thee speake, thou couldest not quote the Scripture so fast, but shee was ready to looke thereon; thus farre was verie commendable.
            But behold what happened, this seeming deuout Gentlewomā chanst to prooue with child: and when the time of her houre drew neere, she acquainted some of her kinswomen with it, who

being readie to attend her, demanded whose the child was; but shee being not willing to returne an answer, staied her tongue so long, in so much that her Kinswomen making an offer to depart, and leaue the duty of womanhood; she presently consest, that it was her eldest brothers; for which I am very sorry to heare it, and I could wish, that it had neuer been.
            Brother, I haue not noted this in way of any disgrace; for such clewes will wind themselues to their open shame: and although

this sin bee grieuous, be it farre from mee to enter into Iudgement in the least degree. I leaue it vnto Iesus Christ, who must iudge both quicke and dead; and therefore without a speedy repentance, thou, who hast most violently pulled this heauy rod of Gods iudgements foorth of his owne hands, which is only peculiar to himselfe, shalt one day heare this heauie sentence of, Goe ye cursedinto euerlasting iudgments. And thus may all men see, what fruits doe come from thy darke doctrine,

and likewise from thy night-Sermons, and how that thou shewest thy selfe vnto the whole world, as Saint Paul saith, To bee but a creeper into mens houses, leading silly women captiue, which are laden with diuers sinnes, and many lusts, 2. Ti. 3. 6. Thou wouldest make all men beleeue, by a little s

               eming strict and outward obseruation, that thou art an innocent, and a harmelesse man: but who is he that hath but halfe an eie, and seeth not, how that thy puritie is without charitie, and thy demurity

but impurity? nay who is so blind, and seeth not the still Sow eating all the draffe? Therefore as Saint Paul saith, He that soweth to the flesh, shall of the flesh reape corruption: Gal. 6. 8.
            
            I could speake much more by experience: but seeing that it is accomplished alreadie, which Saint Paul hath prophesied long before, how that thy madnesse is euidently known vnto all men, 2. Tim. 3. 9. I will therefore giue ouer, where I might herein reprehend thee further, and turne my selfe

            And now, faithful brother in Christ, according to my promise, and that little measure of knowledge which God hath lent me, I haue first shewed thee the difference of the spirit of errour from the Spirit of truth, by the child of disobedience. Secondly, I haue likewise shewed thee the difference

of the spirit of errour from the Spirit of truth by his doctrine, and such fruites

highly conceited in himselfe, that as Saint Iohn saith, He is gone from vs, hauing lost the fellowship of the Brethren, being, as S. Iude saith, so separated, that as Saint Paul affirmeth, Hee is onely become a louer of himselfe, 2. Ti. 3. 2. So that it plainly appeares, that from his doctrine and life doth nothing proceede, but enuie and strife, Phil. 1. 15.
            Thou seest likewise, how that these his followers do rest themselues so much in their outward obseruations, that forgetting wherein they are

trulyiustified, do run into vncharitable iudgements with all others that doe not follow their exercises: for which I doe not condemne them for their outward appearances, only in the manner thereof they marre all. And yet mistake me not: for who is so ignorant, that knoweth not, that the meetings of these multitudes to become publike speakers in the Church, are against the prescript rule and Canon both of God and man? Now hee that vseth these and much more, & either affi

For our Sauiour Christ came not to call the righteous, but
               
               sinners to repentance: Luke 5. 32. Againe, thou seest them by their outward behauiour, as though there were no deceit to be found in them: and yet thou knowest as well as I can tell thee, that their puritie is such, that it will not permit them to speak when they meete vs: and thou likewise knowest, that vnder a colour and shew of fine words in their bargaines, no sect vnder the cope of heauen so readie to deceiue, as they are: in a word, they are so opposite from the example of Christ, and all

And as Saint Paul saith, to count
               
               all things but losse and drosse to be found in him, Phil. 3. 8 let him who hath bought vs at so deare a price, neuer bee forgotten, let vs loue him chiefely in the first place, and in the second, l

And heere I must leaue thee for a while: for I haue something more to say to our elder brother. Farewell in Christ.
            
            
               Brother, comming behinde thee, it was my chance to spy two motes vpon thy Cloake, and because thou couldst not see them thy selfe, I tooke occasion with a sufficient rubber to rub them off: but finding thy cloake to be of Linsey & Wolsey, then I knew that I had spent my labor in vaine: for more paines I tooke, more rough became thy garment: yet expecting some gratuitie, I followed thee into thy house, where we were no sooner entred, but presently thou wentst vp into thy

chamber: & wheras I hoped for something, thou stayedst so long, that my hopes were almost past: but now thou art come, what hast thou for mee?
            
            
               Puri.
               Truely, I haue nothing for thee, onely this, if that my prayers will doe thee any good, thou art welcome: For as S Iames saith; The prayer of the faithfull auaileth much, Iam. 5. 16.
            
            
               Pro.
               Brother, thou sayest well: but me think thy prayers are too long for my weake stomake: For when thou wast in thy chamber, I could

haue wished thy prayers shorter. For beeing both hungry and thirstie, yet no body offered mee so much as a drinke: and to tell thee truely, I finde my weake stomacke by thy long prayer, not a whit better satisfied.
            
            
               Pur.
               What doest thou finde fault with mee for my long prayers?
            
            
               Pro.
               Brother, thou harpest all vpon one string: if thou couldst play vpon that other string, named charitie, as well as thou doest vpon that long string of prayer, I could better indure the length

thereof. But seeing that charitie is so cold in thee, it is a question, whether thy long prayer can preuaile with God, either to doe thy selfe or mee any good, being not accompanied with charitie.
            
            
               Puri.
               I haue talked with thee but too long: for thou art so full of charitie, & so little respectiue vnto my prayer, that I am no more company for thee.
            
            
               Pro.
               Stay, Brother, it is not I that is so much against thee; it is he, whose shoo-latchet, as Saint Iohn saith, wee are not worthy
                  
                  to vnloose, Ioh. 1. 27.
            
            It is he whom thou hast opposed thy selfe against, both in thy disobedience to man, and likewise in thy rash iudgements against both God & Man. And as I haue in loue reprehended thy errours in these two: so likewise I am ready by Gods assistance to reproue thee in thy prayer, wherin thou deseruest. And first for the length of thy prayer. Secōdly, thy behauior whē thou prayest with a touch likewise of thy behauior at the receit of the Sacrament. And for this purpose,

our blessed Sauiour, lest his Disciples should imitate the Heathen in their idle repetitions: he giues them a prescription & forme of prayer, giuing them a special warning to direct and frame all their prayers after the manner of the prayer, Mat. 8. 9. And hereupon I gather, that all long prayers are absolutely for bidden. For seeing that al things concerning both body & soul, are contained within this short compasse of these sixe petitions, I conclude that all our prayers must of necessitie, if we wil follow

Christs direction, be made both pythic and short. And how soeuer I am not able to reason the case with a Scholler, because I am no Scholler my selfe: yet the Spirit of God telleth me against the greatest schollers in the world, that hee is out of Christs schoole, whosoeuer hee bee that doth reason to the contrarie; of which sort, how soeuer they may seeme to please themselues, it is a sufficient argument, that such neither loue Christ, nor his prayer.
            And to make my resolution

good, I am readie to approue it by such two sufficient witnesses, that if thy eyes bee not darkened still, thou wilt confesse the same.
            My first proofe is Christ himselfe, who draweth a reason from Gods omnipotencie, in these words: For your Father knoweth whereof ye haue need, before ye aske of him, Math. 6. 8.
            My second proofe is Salomon in these words: Bee not rash with thy mouth, nor let thy heart be hastie to vtter a thing before God: for God is in the bea
                     •…
                  ens, and thou art on the earth, therefore
               
               let thy words bee few: Eccles. 5. 1. These two examples, who for wisedome was neuer any comparable, these iumpe both in one reason, being drawne from Gods omnipotencie. Now the question is, whether that thou wilt rest thy self still in thy owne conceit, as thou hast done, or thou wilt yeeld thy selfe vnto these 2. examples: I dare vndertake that for any prayer thou makest before thy Sermons, deuide the same into 4. parts, and as much and more may be contained in one part, as is in all the rest.
            
               
Againe, for thy followers likewise: al their prayers with their families in priuate, & all their prayers at their meetings in publike, with their thāks before and after meate, (though these taste very Heathenish) yet rather, then eyther thou or they will direct your prayers after the Lords Prayer, or seeme to taste thereof; you are so farre from any loue, or liking therunto: that your conceited noses beeing so glued vnto that Indian and most stinking weede of your owne imaginations,

that ye haue vtterly refused to taste of that most sweet flowre which growes in the garden of God.
            If one should aske thee this question, why thou doest not knit vp thy prayer before thy Sermons, with the Lords Prayer: It may truely be answered, by the words going before, that it is, because thou neither louest Christ, nor his Prayer: 
                  •…
               nd yet if it chance, that thou doe repeate the same, as seldome thou doest, all that heare thee, may very well perceiue, that the

sweetnesse thereof hath no good rellish, in thy owne conceite: for running it so fast ouer, as though thou wert counting to twenty, doth argue that thou neither takest loue or liking thereunto: and therefore marke well what I say, thou, who refusest the counsell of Iesus Christ, and wilt not be aduised by his followers, resisting the Spirit of grace offered thee, shalt one day, without a speedy repentance, so taste and drinke of that poysoned cup of thy owne conceit, that very deseruedly, and

most worthy therof, thou shalt bee excluded both from Iesus Christ, and his members for euermore.
            Now because that the world shall better perceiue, how contrarie thy thoughts and conceited imaginations are, vnto the true meaning of the Lords Prayer, I will, according to that little measure of knowledge, explaine the same, in as briefe a manner as I can: And first what is meant by hallowed be thy Name: that is, to desire with the inward affection of the heart, that God alone

may haue all honour and glory vnto himselfe: but thou, who restest in thy own conceit, attributest honour vnto thy selfe: herein thou art a thiefe, in robbing God of his glory.
            Againe, Thy Kingdome come: that is, to desire with the inward affection of the heart, that God would so rule and raigne, both in our inward affections, and outward actions, as that neither Sathan, nor our owne corruptions, may rule or domineere against vs, desiring further, that hee

would hasten his comming to Iudgement, becau
                  •…
               e his Name is so greatly dishonored. Now seeing that thou refusest to desire this in thy hart, which God greatly requireth, or vsing to passe it ouer sometimes so slightly as thou doest: it is no maruell, that thou art inchanted by Sathan, to follow the vaine imaginations of thy owne heart. Therefore thou canst not say, & say truly, Hasten thy Kingdome.
            Againe, Thy will be done in earth, as it is in Heauen: That is, to desire that our

wils and affections may bee framed according to Gods will: and as the Angels in heauen are alwaies ready in a heauenly obedience, to do Gods wil, both readily, willingly, and gladly: Euen so should we alwaies be readie in obedience, wherevnto God doth command vs, imitating the Angels, willingly, gladly, & readily. Now how far off thou art from submitting thy wil and affection vnto Gods will, doth appeare in thy disobedience against Principalities and Powers. And againe, how

sarre thou art off from the example of the blessed Angels, appeareth by the fruits both of thy life and doctrine, so that thy will and affections are so contrarie vnto Gods will, that they are only linked vnto the imagination of thy owne heart.
            Againe, Giue vs this day our daily bread: that is, to desire all things conuenient, both for body and soule. Heerein thou hast made thy selfe vnworthy to partake of the least of Gods benefits, yet although the wicked flourish for a time, and that

the dearest of Gods children many times doe want these outward blessings, yet it pleaseth God so to enrich them with his inward graces, that outward wāts neuer trouble their mindes at all.
            Now thou, who art so disobedient both vnto God and man, being but an intruder in thy calling, hast tyed thy selfe in a double bond, as vnworthy to partake of these outward blessings, and resting thy selfe in thine own imaginations, thou hast depriued thy self of the inward graces.

               And forgiue vs our trespasses, as we forgiue them that trespasse against vs.
            
            Whereas wee desire here to haue our offences forgiuen vs with a condition: who knoweth not that all those, who are accompanied with a patient Spirit of adoption, that they are so farre off from the least shaddow of reuenge, that they are alwaies readie, and willing to forgiue their vtter enemies?
            But how contrarie. minded thou art herein, I might appeale vnto thy owne conscience, if thou

haddest any: but seeing thou hast none, the world may iudge what spirit thou art of, as appeareth before, concerning a Letter written vnto one of the chiefe of thy sect. For which how greatly I was troubled, and likewise what it cost my purse, I omit to set downe, because I expect no better requitall at any of your hands, vntill such time, as the wisest in your own conceit can prooue, that grapes may growe vpon thornes, and figgs vpon thistles.
            Againe, And leade vs
               
               not into temptation, but deliuer vs from all euill. Here wee desire that God would not suffer Satan and our naturall corruptions, to tempt vs aboue our strength: and because out greatest strength is too weake to resist, wee desire in the second place so to assist vs, that by his speciall power he would deliuer vs from all euill.
            Now whereas thou hast refused to pray vnto God in Christ, in this most perfect prayer, it is no maruaile that God in his iust iudgement hath giuen thee ouer vnto

Satan, and thy owne corruptions, letting thee swimme in that sinfull sea of thy owne imaginations. And thus may the world see how contrarie thou art to Iesus Christ, and his prayer, refusing the God of light, betaking thy selfe to an Idol god of darknesse.
            Our blessed Sauiour Christ saith, And when thou prayest, be not like the Hypocrite, for they loue to stand and pray in the Synagogues, Matth. 6. 5. and Saint Paul saith, praving for the Ephesians, I bow my knees vnto the Father of
               
               our Lord Iesus Christ, Eph. 3. 14.
            Now, as thou hast shewed thy selfe a contradicted spirit against both God and good men: so now especially, lest the world should not take more full notice of thy folly, thou hast gotten thy selfe into the verie height of shame: and as thy deformed conditions of disobedience haue burst out of thy in ward parts: so now at last thou shewest likewise what a deformed creature thou art, in thy outward parts; for, whē other are at their

praiers, vpon their knees, thou and thy followers stand vp like May-poles amongst vs, as though ye had no knees at all.
            Now, how true this is, it cannot bee denied, for both thy selfe, and infinit multitudes of thy followers, in all places of this Land, doe manifest the same. And as this is true in thy publike prayers in the Church where specially it is forbidden: so likewise at the receiuing of the Sacrament: & although Iesus Christ be as truly there, by the eie of faith, after a spirituall

manner, as though we did beholde him, and touch him as Saint Thomas did: yet thou, who neither fearest God, nor reuerencest man, as thou hast shewed thy selfe a deformed fellow from the beginning, doest not blush to stand, in receiuing this holy Sacrament, when others are vpon their knees. Now if the Officers of the Church come to reproue these thy followers, because they are an offence vnto their brethren, then must their vsurping guide say, Sirra, let them alone:

and thus are almost al the places of this Land abused with this disobedient Sect; and that this is true, wofull experience doth manifest the same.
            If I should aske thee this question, why thou wilt not pray kneeling? thou wilt answer me, It is not because thou thinkest it vnlawfull: but thy reason is, that thou canst pray with as good a deuotion standing, as I can doe kneeling. I doe not deny, but that one may pray standing, going, riding, sitting, or lying. But whereas our Sauiour

Christ cōmands, that we should not stand praying in the Synagogues or Churches: Why wilt thou, hauing conuenient roome, not yeelde thy selfe vnto Christs command? I did once make answere for thee before, and because thou hast no good reason for thy selfe, I will second an answere for thee once againe.
            Because thou wouldest make the world beleeue, that thou art better then thy neighbours in shew of thy outward actions, therefore thou hast separated thy selfe from others,

and rather then the world should not take notice, that thou art singular (as Salomon saith of such) in thy owne eyes still, Prou. 16. 2. Thou now standest streight vp, when others are kneeling, that all men may now behold, that thou art but a plaine Hypocrite.
            Againe, for thy behauiour both at thy first sitting down in the Church, and likewise at thy appearance in the Pulpit, thou art so far frō submitting thy selfe vnto God, that without either priuate prayer, or seeming

to sing with vs; there thou standest looking about th

               e, as though thou wert come from that Indian Countrie, whose prai

               st. Now seeing thou doest but intrude thy self, prefuming too boldly into that place of sanctitìe, if thou wilt neither pray nor sing with vs, couer thy face, or come there no more, and bewaile these sinfull times wherein we liue, as being the principall instrument for Satan thereof, and be sure of this one thing, that ifthou dost not feele

a touch for thy sinnes, vpon the sight heereof, thou maiest perswade thy selfe, that thou art in a most fearefull and lamentable case: and be aduised how thou presumest into that holy place any more: for assure thy sel
                  •…
               e, that Christ, whom thou hast so grieuously offended in his members, will one day, and that verie shortly, without present repentance, require their blood at thy hands, and will auenge their cause in that place, where all Hypocrites shall haue their portion, which burneth

with fire and brimstone for euer.
            One thing more I remember, which I would not willingly haue omitted: how that a reformed Minister submitting himselfe at his approch into the Pulpit, as his maner is, one of thy chiefest followers, being a Ring-leader of this crue, most shamefully burst forth into a scornefull laughter, This is one of thy brood, that being hatcht vnder such a Cockatrice, no better fruit can come therof.
            Now, seeing that all thy outward actions are

but flourisht like painted sepulchres, and that from all thy actions both inward and outward, nothing doth proceede but enuy and strife, pride, and vaine-glory, hatred and malice, and most cruel reuenge: why dost thou not begin to tremble & quake for feare, seeing that the axe is alreadie laid to the roote of the tree, and that euery tree which bringeth not soorth good fruite, must be hewne downe, and cast into the fire, Mat. 7. 19?
            Our blessed Sauiour saith, Hee that is not with me, is against me, Ma. 12. 30
            
               
Now who is he that seeth not, how that thou opposest thy selfe against Christ; and therefore as Saint Iohn saith, an Antichrist, of whom it is said, That there are many gone out into the world, whereby wee know, that it is the last time, I. Iohn 2. 18.
            Againe, who knoweth not, that thou art a starre fallen from heauen, who by thy accusing iudgements, in condemning both the quicke and the dead, seeming to pull that peculiar rod foorth of Gods owne hands, who therewith hauing condemned

the members of Iesus Christ, maketh the very powers of heauen to shake, Mat. 24. 29?
            And againe, who seeth not, that by the frui
                  •…
               s of thy life & doctrine, thou hast caused the Sunne to be darkened, and the Moone to lose her light, the Ministery of the Gospell to be bee e
                     •…
                  ill spoken of, and loue and charitie to bee smothered? And who is hee that doth but looke about▪ and seeth not how that thou with the Pope of Rome, are those two speciall false prophets which goe in sheepes clothing, but
               
               inwardly are rauening wolues, Mat. 7. 15. Whose qualities and conditions, Saint Paul hath plainely described in the 2. Epistle of Timothy, and 3. Chapter; from the first verse vnto the 9. verse: of whom our Sauiour Christ hath 
                  Matth. 7. 10 taught vs, that, by these fruites we know thee. And thus the whole World may plainly see, how thou hast separated thy selfe from the body of the Church; and therefore hast brought thy selfe into a most fearefull and lamentable case: and yet to aduise thee to turne vnto

repentance, I feare me it is in vaine, because Salomon faith, There is more hope in a foole, then of him that is conceited, Pr. 26. 12. And therefore it matters not to tell thee, how thou hast offended God, in denying obedience vnto supreme power, contrary to the Word of God, Mat. 22. 21. Rom. 13. 1. 2. Peter 2. 10. Titus. 3. 1. Iude 8. vers.
            
            It matters not to tell thee how thou hast offended God in thy accusing and condemning iudgements, Mat. 7. 1. Luk. 6. 37 contrary to the Word of

God, Ro. 2. 1. Rom. 14 10. 1. Cor. 4. 3.
            It matters not to tell thee, how contrary thou art to Christ in making al thy prayers, and likevvise how wilfully thou refusest the Lords prayer, Matth. 6. 7. Mat. 6. 9.
            It matters not to tell thee, how contrary thou art to Christs command, in receiuing the Sacrament, and likewise to pray in the Church standing, Mat. 6. 5. Ephes. 3. 14.
            It matters not to tell thee, how that with Esau, thou deadly hatest vs, Genes. 27. 41.
            
               
And likewise to tell thee, how that like Esau, thou hast sold thy birthright for meere vanitie, Genes. 25. 34
            It matters not to tell thee, how thou hast separated thy selfe from vs, 1. Iohn 2. 19. Iude, vers. 19.
            It matters not to tell thee, how thou art become a false prophet, in iudging the young man in the Gospel, Mar. 10. 17
            It matters not to tell thee, that thou art become a false Christ, and a false prophet, in opposing thy self, both against Christ and his Word,

               Mat. 24. 24. Mark. 13. 22. 1. Iohn 2. 18. 1. Peter 2. 1. Iude, vers. 4. Reuel. 22. 19.
            It matters not to tell thee, how contrary thou art to the Word of God in auenging thy self, Mat. 5. 39. Luke 6. 29. Ro. 12. 19. 1. Cor. 6. 7.
            For thou wilt not only denie, wherein I haue in euery particular iustly charged thee: but thou wilt with Pilate, take water, and wash thy hands, and pleade innocency vnto the whole world, and yet this plea will no more preuaile with thee, then it did with him. For as he

pronounced sentence of iudgement against Iesus Christ, the head of the Church, deliuering him vp vnto the hie Priest to be crucified: so hast thou brought his members vnto the barre of Gods iustice, & hauing pronounced sentence of iudgement already against them, it sheweth how willing thou art to offer vs vnto that high Priest, the Pope of Rome, to murder vs: and here may the whole world perceiue Iesus Christ in his members, hanging be

now at last, who is he that liueth in these daies, and doth not lament to behold, how that Religion, euen in those which doe professe Christ, is now become nothing else but a plaine cloke, or a couer for sinne? for is it not too manifest, that some one of the chiefest of thy sect, meeting a Countriman in his trauell by meere chance, took occasion for some by-respect, to haue some conference with him: but his name being demanded, hee did not only peremptorily deny himselfe, but likewise altered

his name, in somuch that some other countrimen, being of good note and fashion, who know him better, then he knowes himselfe, being sorrie to heare a man of his coate, & their Countriman so shamefully to denie himself, demāded further where he dwelt? but his answer being friuolous as before, said, Euery where, where our King hath any land. Now if this, to deny a mans owne selfe, and his country, and to alter his name, bee not such equiuocation, as all of your

sect do hold damnable in a Papist, I referre my selfe vnto your owne iudgements in your seuerall doctrines. Nay, I would know what sinne there is which the chiefest of thy sect will not commit, if so be that hee can but get so much as one figge tree leafe to couer his shame. I will not say, how worthily any of thy sect doe deserue that woe, the which the Prophet Micah saith they shall haue; Who by violence do keep and maintaine the inheritance from the right owners therof. I rather wish from the

bottom of my heart as a friend, that if any such be guiltie in this kinde, that not onely present restitution bee made, but likewise to get them forth of that place, who so vnconscionably remaine therein. For assure himselfe, whatsoeuer he bee, and howsoeuer by quillits and trickes, great boastes may be made thereof; yet certainely, without all doubt, at that tribunall seat of Christ, such vncertainties shall beare no plea at all: for better things, then these shall be

For (saith hee) to praise a mans owne selfe, the children of God, not going without the line of Gods Word, reioyce in no such things. 2. Cor. 10. 13. Therefore seeing that most of thy Sect are so ready to boast and compare your selues before others, it may bee required, and very necessarie for thee to shew, what Townes or Countries ye haue wonne vnto the Lord. But for thy answere herein, it is needlesse. For being too apparant,

that such Trees cannot possibly bring forth any good fruit, what can it preuaile thee to haue an Angels tongue, and a Deuils heart? thou art no better then a post in the crosse-way, that rots it selfe to direct others. To speake well, and doeill, is to build vp heauen with the voice, and hell with the conuersation: and therefore seeing that thy words and thy deeds doe not agree together, I may truely compare thee vnto such a Souldier, which at the table could make fine talke of warres: who

when hee came into the field to fight, was neither valiant nor expert: and therefore seeing that all thy actions both inward and outward, being not guided by the line of Gods Word, but by thy own conceit: no maruell that they proue, as Saint Iude saith, but spots in your feasts of charitie, which being without all feare, feede but your selues, being clouds without water, carried about with windes, corrupt trees without fruit, twice dead and plucked vp by the roo

And therefore to giue thee a Title of an English Pharise, or but an imitator of Religion, all such which truely perceiue any thing, may plainely see, that I haue done thee no wrōg at al. And now at last, because thou art conceited in thy selfe; Of such Salomon saith, there is no hope, hauing ioyned thy selfe with the Pope of

Rome, in your false imaginations, wherein yee thinke that yee doe God good seruice: I must of necessitie, seeing that the god of this world hath thus darkened your vnderstandings, leaue you at your study of vanities, to ponder vpon these places of Scripture vnder-written.

            For I must turne my selfe vnto such, of whom

as Saint Paul saith, I perswade my self better things, Heb. 6. 9 And who haue not thus learned Christ, Ephes. 4. 20. which beeing taught by him, walke as the truth is in Iesus, Ephes. 4. 21. being renewed in the Spirit of their mindes, Ephes. 4. 23. walke so as they haue Iesus Christ for an example, who hauing put off that old man of sinne, are now become so sanctified in their liues and conuersations, that beeing clothed with that glorious garment and robes of righteousnes, do walk worthy of their calling

in true holinesse of life.
            And now, faithfull Brethren in Christ, of whom I wish as to my owne soule, seeing that this our elder brother doth so rest himselfe in this word, only in Christ, that neglecting such duties required at his hands, runnes into all manner of sinne: Let it be your speciall care, and such a warning vnto you, that you neuer cherish or har bour any one sinne at all, and that not any one sinne may seeme pleasing in your eyes: striue and endeuour against all sin. For without holinesse no

man shall see the Lord. And againe, seeing that Christ doth command vs, not onely to beleeue in him: but to loue one another, 1. Ioh. 3. 23. Let it not be, as Saint Iohn saith, in word and in tongue onely, but in deede and in truth, 1. Iohn 3. 18. For hee that hath this worlds goods, and seeth his brother haue need, and shutteth vp his compassion from him, how dwelleth the loue of God in him, 1. Ioh. 3. 17. Therefore I humbly intreat you, in the bowels and compassion of Iesus Christ, as you tender your owne soules, that ye walk

worthy of your vocation whereunto ye are called, with all humblenesse of minde, in meekenes, with long suffering, supporting one another through loue, alwaies endeuoring to keepe the vnitie of the Spirit, in the bond of peace, hauing your lamps, with those fiue wise Virgins, so furnished with the oyle of Gods graces, that our blessed Sauiour, at his generall appearance, may haue iust cause to say: Come yee blessed of my Father, possesse the Kingdome prepared for you, before the foundations
               
               of the world, Mat. 25. 34. For when I was an hungred, ye gaue mee meate; I thirsted, and yee gaue mee drinke; I was a stranger, and ye lodged me; I was naked, and yee clothed mee; I was sicke, and yee visited mee; I was in prison, and yee came vnto mee, Mat. 25. 35, 36. Now enter into your masters ioy, vnto the society of that blessed company of Angels, & Archangels, and all holy men and women, and children departed, there to remaine in euerlasting comforts, for euermore.
            
               
And here, my faithfull Brethren, I trust in Christ Iesus, that we shall meete there very shortly, to sing with that holy company, euerlasting praise to the whole Trinitie, to God the Father, who hath created vs, to God the Sonne, who hath redeemed vs, and to God the holy Ghost our comforter, who hath, & doth sanctifie vs, to whom bee endlesse praise for euer and euer. And now at last, that this glorious Kingdome may bee increased, let mee intreat you once againe to ioine

with me in our continuall prayers, in often remembrance vnto this holy Trinitie, that this little number, which being the signe of the Son of man, may be so aduanced now hard before hiscomming, that these thicke cloudes of iniquitie being dispersed, it may appeare more cleare vnto the view of the whole world.
            And that this may be the better and sooner effected, I most humbly desire the Lord of Hosts, from the very bottom of my heart, with heartie teares of humilitie, vpon

my bended knees, that it would please him of his infinite mercy, so to grace our most gracious and reuerend Bishops of this Land, that they all in generall, both in word and deede, may bee so readie to stop the passage of these mystie cloudes of darknesse, that the Gospell of Iesus Christ being the true light, may shew it selfe like the bright morning Starre, now at his last cōming to iudgement. And againe, grant, deare Father, for thy honour and blessed names sake, vnto our most gracious

and reuerend Bishops of this Land, with all reformed Ministers of the same, such a powerfull spirit of humilitie, that they being able to beate downe these transcendēt spirits of iniquity, thy glorie shining more cleerly, the power of sinne and Satan may bee darkened speedily, and that these most sinfull times may haue a speedie ende, I humbly desire with thy seruant Iohn in the Reuelation; Come Lord, come Lord Iesus, come quickly. Amen.

            THy disobedience it doth reach in height aboue the skies:
            Thy hie conceit doth please thee well, and therein thou art wise.
            Disdaine within thy heart doth dwel, fraught with reuenge an dire:
            Thy words burst out in iudgements as hot as any fire. (deepe,
            With singular eie thou do'st espy: great beames in others sight,
            And therin do'st thy self much boast, with rayling words of might.
            Leaue off for shame, thou hast disgrast thy selfe in open view:
            The Scripture doth reueale thee plain, and therefore is most true.
            Thy prayers long doe please thee wel, against the Word of Christ:
            In him thou wilt not rest alone, by Satan thou art tiste.
            
               
Thou wilt stand vp in thy conceite, in begging for thy neede:
            Without remēbrance where thou art, in full hope for to speede.
            But hee that doth behold thy face, whose face thou do'st not feare,
            Will send thee away to thy disgrace, where want shall be thy cheare.

            Thus hauing climde in thy conceite, in height aboue thy reach:
            And with misconstring of the same, the Scriptures for to search,
            Thy height of pride hath brought thee for want of penitent speed: (low,
            Wherein thou hast thy selfe disgrast, thy humours for to feede.

            To all true Christians.
            And now at last, a word or two, vnto my brethren deare,
            Who honour God, and loue his Word, his holy name to feare.
            Goe on with speed and courage great, your time it is but short,
            And shew your selues in loue and each others to exhort. (peace,
            Then he that bought vs deare, will and meet vs in the cloudes, (come,
            
               
With Angels bright, full cleare in to call vs forth of mouldes. (sight,

            Where wee shall raigne for euermore, his glorie for to see,
            Who hath redeem'd vs from our sins, and now hath set vs free:

still liue in thy fauour, and heereafter depart in thy fauour, for thy blessed names sake. Amen.
            LOrd protect our most gracious King and Queene, and that hopefull progenie, from the cruell rage of Satan, and all his wicked instruments, and grant, wee most humbly beseech thee, that his Highnes, and his, continuing in a godly feare, may liue to praise thy most holy name, vntill the comming againe of Iesus Christ, and that for his owne names sake,

            To know a Puritane from a true Christian.
            IF any desire to know, what a Puritane is, looke in the second Epistle of Saint Paul to Timothie, the third Chapter, from the first verse vnto the ninth verse, and there yee may plainly perceiue the qualities and conditions both of him and the Pope of Rome, with all others of those Antichrists, the which haue banded themselues against the Lord and his Anointed: and although that they haue gotten themselues painted names: yet Saint Paul tels vs, and wee must beleeue him, That they are mad men out of their
               
               wits, whose madnesse (saith hee) is now euident vnto all men, 9. verse.
            
            Heere may the whole world perceiue all such, which haue and doe persecute Christ Iesus in his members; especially, those two monstrous heads, the which doe so cunningly labour in sheepes clothing, the Pope and the Puritane.
            Now, if any desire to see Iesus Christ in his members, which is the true Church of God, looke from the ninth verse, vnto the end of the Chapter, and there ye may behold the true signe of the Sonne of Man, where ye may perceiue, all the elect faces of Gods children in that spirituall glasse of immortalitie: especially,

his Euangelicall face, of whom it may truely be said, That he hath knowne the Scriptures of a child, I meane, our most gracious King, whom the Lord of his infinite mercy for his honour, and the good of his Church, doth by his vnsearchable prouidence, now protect amongst vs; therfore most blessed hee, and his, who shall dwell in euerlasting peace, and neuer die.
            Farewell vnto the whole world.
