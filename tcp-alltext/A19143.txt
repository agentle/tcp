            YE are come to gether to
daye / fathers and ryghte wyse
men / to entre councell: in the whiche / 
what ye wyll do / and what
matters ye wyll handell / yet we
vnderstande nat. But we wysshe / 
that ones remēbrynge your name
and profession / ye wold mynde the
reformation of the churches matter.
For hit was neuer more nede.
And ye state of the churche dyd neuer
desyre more your endeuours.
For ye spouse of Christe / ye churche / 
whom ye wolde shulde be without
spotte or wryncle / is made foule
and euyl fauord / as saith Esaias:
The faithfull cite is made an harlotte:
And as saythe Hieremias:
She hath done lechery with many
louers: wherby she hath cōceiued
many sedes of wyckednes: and

dayly bryngeth forthe very foule
frute. wherfore I came hyther to
day fathers / to warne you / that in
this your councell / with all your
mynde / ye thynke vpon the reformation
of the churche. But for
sothe I came nat wyllyngly: For
I knewe myne vnworthynes. I
sawe besyde / howe harde it was to
please the precise iugement of so
many men. For I iuged it vtterly
vnworthy and vnmete / ye and almost
to malapert / that I a seruāt / 
shulde counsaile my lordes: That
I a sonne / shulde teache you my
fathers. Truely it had bene meter
for some one of the fathers / yt is to
say / you prelates might haue done
it with more graue auctorite / and
greatter wysedome. But the commaundement
was to be obeyed of

the most reuerent father and lorde / 
the archebysshoppe / presydent of
this councell / whiche layde vpon
me this bourden / truly to heuy for
me. we rede / that the prophette
Samuel sayde: Obedience is better
than sacrifice? wherfore fathers
and ryghte worthy men / I
praye you / and beseche you / that
this day ye wold susteyne my weakenes
with your goodnes and pacience.
Farthermore to helpe me
at the begynnyng with your good
prayers. And before all thynge let
vs praye vnto god the father all
myghty. Fyrste remembrynge our
most holy father the pope / and all
spirituall pastours / with all christen
people / farthermore the moost
reuerēt father and lorde / the archebishoppe
president of this coūcell / 

and al bishops / and al the Clergie / 
and all the people of Englande:
Remembrynge fynally this your
cōgregation / desirynge god to inspire
your myndes so accordyngly
to agre / to suche profyte and frute
of the churche / that ye seme nat after
the councell fynysshed / to haue
ben gethered to gether in vayne &
without cause. Lette vs all saye
Pater noster.
            To exhorte you reuerent fathers
to the endeuour of reformation of
ye churches estate: bicause that nothynge
hath so disfigured the face
of the churche / as hath the facion
of seculer and worldly lyuynge in
clerkes and prestes: I knowe nat
where more conueniently to take
begynnyng of my tale / than of the
apostle Paule / in whose temple ye

are gethered to gether. For he writynge
vnto the Romanes / and vnder
their name vnto you saith: Be
you nat conformed to this worlde:
but be you reformed in the newnes
of your vnderstandynge / that ye
may proue what is the good wyll
of god well pleasing and perfecte.
This dyd the apostell wryte to all
christen men / but most chiefly vnto
prestes and bysshops. Prestes and
bysshops are the light of ye worlde.
For vnto them sayde our sauiour:
you are the lyghte of the worlde.
And he sayde also: If the lyghte
that is in the be darkenes / howe
darke shall the darkenes be? That
is to say / if prestes and bysshops / 
that shulde be as lyghtes / ronne in
the darke way of the worlde / howe
darke than shall the secular people

be? wherfore saynt Paule sayde
chiefly vnto prestes and byshops:
Be you nat conformable to this
worlde / but be ye reformed. In the
whiche wordes the apostle dothe
two thinges. Fyrst he doth forbyd
that we be nat conformable to the
worlde / and be made carnall. Farthermore
he dothe cōmaunde that
we be reformed in the spyryte of
god / wherby we are spirituall. I
entendynge to folowe this ordre / 
I wyll speke first of confirmation / 
than after of reformation. Be you
nat (sayth he) conformable to this
worlde. The apostle calleth the
worlde / the wayes and maner of
secular lyuing: the whiche chiefly
dothe reste in foure euilles of this
worlde: that is to say / in diuilisshe
pride / in carnall concupiscence / in

worldly couetousnes / in secular busines:
These are in the worlde / as
saynt Iohn̄ the apostle witnesseth
in his pistell canonicall. For he
saythe: All thynge that is in the
worlde / is either the concupiscence
of the flesshe / or the concupiscence
of the eies / or pryde of lyfe. The
same are nowe and reygne in the
churche / and in mē of the churche / 
that we may seme truely to say / all
thynge that is in the churche / is either
cōcupiscence of fleshe / or eies / 
or pryde of lyfe. And fyrste for to
speake of pride of lyfe / howe moche
gredynes and appetite of honour
and dignitie is nowe a dayes
in men of the churche? Howe rōne
they / ye almost out of brethe / from
one benefice to an other: from the
lesse to the more / from the lower to

the hygher? who seeth nat this?
who seynge this sorowethe nat?
More ouer these yt are in the same
dignities / the moost parte of them
doth go with so stately a coūtenāce
and with so hygh lokes / that they
seme nat to be put in the humble
bysshoprike of Christe / but rather
in the high lordship / & power of the
worlde / nat knowing / nor aduertisinge / 
what Christe / the mayster
of all mekenes / sayd vnto his disciples / 
whom he called to be bysshoppes
and prestes: The princis
of people (sayth he) haue lordshyp
of them: and those that be in auctorite
haue power: but do ye nat
so: but he that is greatter amonge
you / let him be minister. He that is
highest in dignitie / be he the seruāt
of all men. The sonne of mā came

nat to be minystred vnto / but to
ministre. By whiche wordes our
sauiour doth playnly teache / that
the maistry in the churche / is none
other thynge than a ministration:
And the hygh dignitie in a man of
the churche / to be none other thing
than a meke seruice.
            The seconde secular euyll is carnall
concupiscence. Hath nat this
vice so growen and waxen in the
churche as a fludde of their luste?
so that there is nothyng loked fore
more diligently / in this moost besy
tyme / of the most parte of prestes / 
than that that dothe delite & please
the senses? They gyue them selfe
to feastes and bankettynge: They
spēde them selfe in vaine bablyng:
They gyue them selfe to sportes &
playes: They applye them selfe to

huntynge and haukynge. They
drowne them selfe in the delytes of
this worlde. Procurers & fynders
of lustes they set by. Against ye whiche
kynde of men / Iudas the apostle
crieth out in his pistel / sayeng:
wo vnto them / whiche haue gone
the way of Cain: They ar foule &
bestly festing in their meates without
feare fedyng them selfe: fluddes
of the wylde see / fomynge fomynge
out their confusions: vnto
whom the storme of darkenes is
reserued for euerlastynge.
            Couetousnes is the thyrde secular
euyll: the whiche saynt Iohn̄
the apostell calleth concupiscence
of the eies: Saynt Paule calleth
hit idolatry. This abominable pestilēce
hath so entred in the minde / 
almost of all pristes / and so hath

blinded the eies of the minde / that
we are blynde to all thynges / but
onely vnto those / whiche seme to
brynge vnto vs some gaynes. For
what other thinge seke we nowe a
dayes in the churche / than fatte benefices
and hygh promotions? ye
& in the same promotions / of what
other thyng do we passe vpon / thā
of our tithes and rētes? That we
care nat howe many / howe chargeful / 
howe great benefices we take / 
so that they be of greatte valure.
O couetousnes: saint Paule iustly
called the ye roote of all euyl. Of yt
comech this heaping of benefices
vpon benefices: Of the so great
pensions assigned of many benefyces
resygned: Of the / all the
suynge for tithes / for offrynge / for
mortuaries / for delapidations / by

the right and title of the churche:
For the whiche thing we stryue no
lesse thā for our owne life: O couetousnes:
of the cometh these chargefull
visitations of bysshops / of
the cometh the corruptnes of courtes
and these daily newe inuētiōs / 
where with the sely people are so
sore vexed. Of the cometh the besyte
and wantonnes of officials.
O couetousnes mother of all iniquitie.
Of the cometh this feruēt
study of ordinaries to dilate their
iurisdictions: Of the cometh this
woode and ragenge contention in
ordinaries / of the insinuatiō of testamentes:
of the cometh the vndewe
sequestration of frutes: Of
the cometh the superstitious obseruyng
of al those lawes / that soūde
to any lucre / settynge a syde and

dispisynge those that concerne the
amendmēt of maners. what shuld
I reherse the reste? To be shorte / 
and to conclude at one worde: All
corruptnes / all the decaye of the
churche / all the offences of the
worlde / come of the couetousnes
of prestes. Accordynge to that of
Saynt Paule / that here I repete
agayne / and beate in to your eares:
Couetousnes is the roote of
all euyll.
            The fourthe secular euyll / that
spotteth and maketh yll fauored
the face of the churche / is the continuall
secular occupation: wherin
prestes & bysshops nowe a dayes
doth besy thē selfe / the seruātes rather
of men than of god: the warriours
rather of this worlde than
of Christe. For the apostle Paule

writeth vnto Timothe: No man
beinge goddes soudiour / turmoyle
hym selfe with seculare busynes.
The warrynge of them is nat carnall
but spirituall. For our warrynge
is to pray / to rede and study
scriptures / to preache the worde of
god / to ministre the sacramentes
of helth / to do sacrifice for the people / 
and to offre hostis for their sinnes.
For we are mediatours and
meanes vnto god for men: The
whiche saynt Paule witnessethe / 
writynge to the Hebrewes: Euery
byshoppe (sayth he) taken of men / 
is ordeyned for men in those thynges
that be vnto god / that he may
offre gyftes and sacrifices for synnes.
wherfore those apostels / that
were the first pristes and byshops / 
dydde so moche abhorre from all

maner of medlyng of secular thinges / 
that they wolde nat minystre
the meate / that was necessarye to
poore people / all though that were
a great worke of vertue: but they
sayd: it is nat mete / that we shulde
leaue the worde of god / and serue
tables: we wyll be continually in
prayer / and preachynge the worde
of god. And saynt Paule crieth vnto
the Corinthes. If you haue
any secular besynes / ordeyne them
to be iuges / that be mooste in contempt
in ye churche. without dout / 
of this secularitie / and that clerkes
and prestes (leauyng all spiritualnes)
do turmoyle them selfe with
erthly occupations / many euils do
folowe. Fyrst the dignitie of pristhode
is dysshonoured / the whiche
is greatter than other the kynges

or emperours: it is egall with the
dignite of angels. But the brightnes
of this great dignitie is sore
shadowed / whan prestes are occupied
in erthly thinges: whose conuersation
ought to be in heuen.
            Secondarily pristhode is dispised / 
whan there is no difference betwixt
suche pristis and lay people:
but accordynge to the prophecy of
Ozee. As the people be / so are
the pristes.
            Thyrdly the beautiful ordre / and
holy dignite in the churche / is confused / 
whā the highest in the churche
do meddle with vile and erthly
thynges: and in theyr stede / vile
& abiecte persons do exercise hygh
and heuenly thinges.
            Fourthly the laye people haue
great occasion of euils and cause

to fall / whan those men whose dutie
is to drawe men from the affection
of this worlde / by their continual
conuersation in this worlde / 
teche men to loue this worlde: and
of the loue of the worlde cast them
downe heedlyng in to hell.
            More ouer in suche pristes / that
are so besyed / there must nedes folowe
hypocrisy. For whan they be
so mixte and confused with the lay
people / vnder the garmēt and habite
of a priste / they lyue playnly
after the lay facion. Also by spiritual
wekenes and bondage feare / 
whan they are made weake with
the waters of this worlde: they
dare neyther do nor say / but suche
thynges as they knowe to be pleasant
and thākefull to their princis.
At laste ignorancy and blyndnes / 

whan they are blynded with the
darknes of this worlde / they se nothynge
but erthly thynges. wherfore
our sauiour Christe / nat with
out cause / dyd warne the prelates
of his churche: Take hede (sayde
he) lest your hartes be greued with
glotony and dronkēnes / and with
the cares of this worlde. with the
cares (saythe he) of this worlde / 
wherwith the hartes of pristes beynge
sore charged / they canne nat
holde and lyfte vp their myndes to
high and heuenly thinges.
            Many other euils ther be / beside
those that folowe of the secularitie
of pristis / whiche were longe here
to reherce / but I make an ende.
            These be the foure euyls that I
haue spoken of / O fathers / O pristes / 
by the whiche we are conformable

to this worlde / by the whiche
the face of the churche is made
euyll fauoured / by the whiche the
state of it is distroyed / truly moche
more thā it was in the begynnyng
by the persecution of tyrantes: or
afterward by the inuasion that folowed
of heretikes. For in the persecution
of tyrantes / the churche
beynge vexed was made stronger
and bryghter: In the inuasion of
heretykes / the churche beynge shaken / 
was made wyser and more
cunnyng in holy writte. But sens
this secularitie was broughte in / 
after that the secular maner of lyuynge
crepte in / in the men of the
churche: the roote of all spirituall
lyfe / that is to say / charite was extincte:
The whiche taken awaye / 
there can nother wyse nor stronge

churche be in god.
            In this tyme also we perceyue
contradiction of the laye people.
But they are nat so moche contrarye
vnto vs / as we are our selfe.
Nor theyr contrarines hurteth nat
vs so moche as the contrarines of
our euyll lyfe / the whiche is contrary
both to god and Christe. For
he sayd: who that is nat with me / 
is agaynst me.
            we are also nowe a dayes greued
of heretykes / men mad with marueylous
folysshenes: but the heresies
of them are nat so pestilēt and
pernicious vnto vs and the people / 
as the euyll and wicked lyfe of
pristes: the whiche (if we beleue
saynt Barnard) is a certeyn kynde
of heresye / and chiefe of all / and
most perillous. For that same holy

father / in a certeyne conuocation / 
preachynge vnto the pristes of his
tyme / in a certayne sermon / so he
sayde by these wordes. There be
many catholyke and faithfull men
in speakynge and preachynge / the
whiche same men are heretykes in
workyng: For that that heretikes
do by euyll teachynge: that same
do they throughe euyll exaumple / 
they leade the people oute of the
ryght way / and brynge them in to
errour of lyfe. And so moche they
are worse than heretyckes / howe
moche theyr workes preuaile their
wordes. This that holye father
saynt Barnarde / with a great and
a feruent spirite / sayde agaynste
the sect of euyl pristes in his time:
By whiche wordes he shewethe
playnly / to be two maner of heresyes / 

the one to be of peruerse teachynge / 
and the tother of naughty
life: Of whiche this later is worse
and more peryllous: the whiche
raygneth nowe in the churche in
pristes / nat lyuynge pristly but secularly / 
to the vtter and miserable
distruction of the churche. wherfore
you fathers / you prestes / and
all you of the clergie / at the laste
loke vp & awake / from this your
slepe in this forgetful worlde: And
at the laste / beynge well awaked / 
here Paule crienge vnto you: Be
you nat conformable vnto this
worlde. And this for the first part.
Nowe let vs come to the seconde.
            
               The seconde parte of
reformation.
               
                  
BUt be you reformed in
the newnes of your vnderstandynge.
The seconde thynge
that saynt Paule commandeth / is
that we be reformed in to a newe
vnderstandynge / that we smelle
those thynges that be of god. Be
we reformed vnto those thynges / 
that are contrary to those I spake
of euen nowe: that is to saye / to
mekenes / to sobernes / to charite / 
to spirituall occupation: That as
ye sayd Paule writeth vnto Titus / 
Renyenge al wickednes & worldly
desires / we lyue in this worlde soberly / 
truely / and vertuously.
               This reformation and restoring
of the churches estate muste nedes
begynne of you our fathers / and
so folowe in vs your pristes / and

in all the clergye. you are our heedes:
you are an example of liuing
vnto vs. Unto you we loke as vnto
markes of our directiō. In you
and in your lyfe we desyre to rede
as in lyuely bokes / howe & after
what facion we may lyue. wherfore
if you wyll ponder and loke
vpon oure mottis / fyrste take awaye
the blockes out of your eies.
Hit is an olde prouerbe: Phisition
heale thy selfe. you spirituall phisitions / 
fyrst taste you this medicine
of purgation of maners: and thā
after offre vs the same to taste.
               The waye / where by the churche
maye be reformed in to better faciō / 
is nat for to make newe lawis.
For there be lawes many / inowe / 
and out of nombre / as Salomon
saith: Nothyng is newe vnder the

sonne. For the euils that are nowe
in the churche / were before in tyme
paste: and there is no faute / but
that fathers haue prouyded very
good remedies for hit. There are
no trespaces / but that there be lawes
against them in ye body of the
Canon lawe. Therfore hit is no
nede / that newe lawes and constitutions
be made: But that those / 
that are made all redye / be kepte.
wherfore in this your assemble / let
those lawes / that are made / be called
before you and rehersed. Those
lawes (I say) that restrayne vice / 
and those that furder vertue.
               Fyrst let those lawes be rehersed / 
that do warne you fathers / that ye
put nat ouer soone your handes
on euery mā / or admitte vnto holy
orders. For ther is ye well of euils / 

that the brode gate of holy orders
opened / euery man that offereth
hym selfe / is all where admytted
without pullynge backe. Therof
spryngeth and cometh out the people / 
that are in the churche both of
vnlerned and euyll pristes. Hit is
nat inough for a priste (after my
iugement) to construe a collette / to
put forth a question / or to answere
to a sopheme: but moche more a
good / a pure / and a holy life / approued
maners / metely lernynge of
holye scripture / some knowlege of
the sacramentes. Chiefly & aboue
all thyng / the feare of god / & loue
of the heuenly lyfe.
               Let the lawes be rehersed / that
commaunde that benefices of the
churche be gyuen to those that are
worthy: And that promotions be

made in the churche by the ryghte
balance of vertue / nat by carnall
affection: nat by the acception of
persones: wherby hit happeneth
nowe adayes / that boyes for olde
men / fooles for wise men / euyll for
good / do reigne and rule.
               Lette the lawes be rehersed / that
warreth agaynst the spotte of Symonie.
The whiche coruption / the
whiche infection / the whiche cruell
& odible pestilence so crepteth nowe
abrode / as the canker euyll / in the
myndes of prestes: that many of
them are nat aferde nowe a dayes / 
both by prayer and seruice / rewardes
and promesses / to gette them
great dignities.
               Lette the lawes be rehersed / that
commaunde personall residence of
curates in theyr churches. For of

this many euils growe: by cause
all thinges nowe a dayes are done
by vicaries and parysshe prestes:
ye and those foolysshe also / and
vnmete: and often tymes wicked:
that seke none other thynge in the
people than foule lucre / wherof cometh
occasion of euyl heresies / and
yll christendome in the people.
               Lette be rehersed the lawes and
holy rules gyuen of fathers / of the
lyfe and honestie of clerkes: that
forbydde that a clerke be no marchant / 
that he be no vsurer / that he
be no hunter / that he be no cōmon
player / that he beare no weapon.
               The lawes that forbyd clerkes
to haunte tauernes: that forbydde
them to haue suspecte familiaritie
with women. The lawes that cō
                  maunde
sobernes / and a measurablenes

in aparayle / and temperāce
in adournynge of the body.
               Let be rehersed also to my lordes
these monkes / chanons / and religious
men / the lawes that commande
them to go the straite way / 
that leadeth vnto heuen: leauyng
the brode way of the worlde: that
commandeth them nat to turmoile
them selfe in busynes / nother secular
nor other: That commaunde / 
that they sewe nat in princis courtes
for erthly thynges. For it is in
the coūcell of Calcidinens / that
monkes ought onely to gyue them
selfe to prayer and fastyng / and to
the chastynge of their fleshe / and
obseruyng of theyr rules.
               Aboue all thynges let the lawes
be rehersed / that pertayne and concerne
you my reuerent fathers and

lordes / bysshops / lawes of your
iuste and canonical election / in the
chaptres of your churches / with
the callynge of the holy goste. For
bycause that is nat done nowe a
dayes / And bycause prelates are
chosen often times more be fauour
of men than by the grace of god:
Therfore truly haue we nat a fewe
tymes bishops ful lytell spirituall / 
men rather worldly than heuenly / 
sauouryng more the spirite of this
worlde than the spirite of Christe.
               Let the lawes be rehersed of the
residence of bysshops in theyr diocesis:
that commaunde / that they
loke diligently / and take hede to
the helthe of soules: That they
sowe the worde of god: That they
shewe them selfe in their churches / 
at the leest on greatte holye dayes.

That they do sacrifice for their people:
That they here the causes and
matters of poure men: That they
susteine fatherles children and widowes:
That they exercise them
selfe in workes of vertue.
               Let the lawes be rehersed of the
good bestowyng of the patrimony
of Christe. The lawes that commande
that the goodes of the churche
be spent / nat in costly byldyng / 
nat in sumptuous apparell / and
pompis: nat in feastyng and bankettynge:
nat in excesse and wantonnes:
nat in enrichinge of kyns
folke: nat in kepynge of dogges / 
but in thinges profitable and necessary
to the churche. For whan
saynt Augustine / some tyme bysshoppe
of Englande / dyd aske the
pope Gregorie / howe that the bysshops

and prelates of Englande / 
shulde spende theyr goodes / that
were the offringes of faithfull people.
The said pope answered (and
his answere is put in the decrees / 
in the .xij. chap. & seconde question)
that the goodes of byshops ought
to be deuyded in to .iiij. partes:
wherof one parte oughte to be to
the bysshoppe and his householde:
An other to his clerkes: The third
to repayre and vp holde his tenementes:
The fourth to the poure
people.
               Let the lawes be rehersed / ye and
that often tymes / that take away
the filthes and vnclenlines of courtes:
that take awaye those daylye
newe founde craftes for lucre: that
besy them to pulle away this foule
couetousnes / the whiche is the

spryng and cause of all euils: The
whiche is the well of all iniquitie.
               At the laste let be renewed those
lawes and cōstitutions of fathers
of the celebration of councels / that
commaunde prouinciall councels
to be oftener vsed for the reformation
of the churche. For there neuer
hapneth nothyng more hurtefull
to the churche of Christe / than
the lacke both of councell generall
and prouinciall.
               whan these lawes / and suche other
ar rehersed that be for vs / and
that concerne the correction of maners / 
there lacketh nothynge / but
that the same be put in execution / 
with all auctoritie and power.
               That ones (seing we haue a lawe)
we liue after the lawe. For the whiche
thinges / with al due reuerence / 

I calle chiefly vpon you fathers.
For this execution of the lawes / 
and obseruyng of the constitutiōs / 
muste nedes begynne of you / that
ye may teache vs pristes to folowe
you by lyuely examples: or elles
trewely hit wyll be sayde of you:
They lay greuous burdens vpon
other mens backes / and they them
selfe wyll nat as moche as touche
hit with theyr lytell fynger.
               For sothe if you kepe the lawes:
and if you reforme fyrste your lyfe
to the rules of the Canon lawes / 
than shall ye gyue vs lyght (in the
whiche we maye se what is to be
done of our parte) That is to say / 
the lyghte of your good example:
And we seynge our fathers so keping
the lawes / wyl gladly folowe
the steppes of our fathers.
               
                  
The clergies and spirituals part
ones reformed in the churche / than
may we with a iuste order procede
to the reformatiō of the lays part:
The whiche trewely wyll be verye
easy to do: if we fyrst be reformed.
For the bodye foloweth the soule.
And suche rulers as are in the cite / 
lyke dwellers be in it. wherfore if
pristes / that haue ye charge of soules / 
be good: streyghte the people
wyll be good. Our goodnes shall
teche them more clerely to be good
than al other teachynges and prechynges.
Our goodnes shall compell
them in to the right way / truly
more effectuously / thā all your suspendynges
and cursynges.
               wherfore if ye wyll haue the lay
people to lyue after your wysshe
and wyll: fyrst lyue you your selfe

after the wyl of god. And so (trust
me) ye shall gette in them what so
euer ye wyll.
               ye wyll be obeyed of them / and
right it is. For in the epistell to the
Hebrewes / these are the wordes of
saynt Paule to the laye people.
               Obey (saith he) to your rulers / and
be you vnder them. But if ye wyll
haue this obedience: first performe
in you the reason and cause of obedience:
the whiche the sayd Paule
dothe teache: and hit foloweth in
the texte: that is: Take you hede
also diligently / as though ye shuld
gyue a recknynge for theyr soules:
and they wyll obey you.
               you wyll be honored of the people:
hit is reason. For saint Paule
wryteth vnto Timothe: Pristes
that rule well / are worthy double

honours / chiefly those that labour
in worde and teachynge. Therfore
if ye desyre to be honoured: fyrste
loke that ye rule well / and that ye
laboure in worde and teachynge:
and than shall the people haue you
in all honour.
               you wyll repe theyr carnall thinges / 
and gether tithes and offrynges
without any stryuynge: right
it is. For saynt Paule writing vnto
the Romanes / sayth: They are
dettours / & ought to ministre vnto
you in carnall thinges. Fyrst sowe
you your spirituall thynges: and
than ye shall repe plentifully theyr
carnall thynges. For truely that
mā is very harde and vniust / that
wyl repe where he neuer dyd sowe:
and that wyll gether where he neuer
skatered.
               
                  
ye wyl haue the churches liberte / 
and nat to be drawen afore secular
iuges / and that also is ryght. For
hit is in the psalmis. Touche ye
nat myne anoynted. But if ye desire
this liberte: fyrst vnlouse your
selfe frome the worldlye bondage / 
and from the seruices of men: and
lyfte vp your selfe in to the trewe
lybertye / the spirituall lybertye of
Christe / in to grace frome synnes / 
and serue you god / and raygne in
hym. And than (beleue me) the
people wyll nat touche the anoynted
of theyr lorde god.
               ye wolde be out of busines in rest
and peace: and that is conuenient.
But if ye wyll haue peace come agayne
to the god of peace & loue.
Come agayne to Christe: in whom
is the very true peace of the goste / 

the whiche passeth al wytte. Come
agayne to your selfe / and to your
pristly lyuynge. And to make an
ende / as saynt Paule saythe: Be
you reformed in ye newnes of your
vnderstandynge / that you sauoure
those thynges that are of god: and
the peace of god shall be with you.
               These are they reuerent fathers
and ryghte famous men / that I
thought to be said for the reformation
of the churches estate: I trust
ye wyll take them of your gentylnes
to the best. And if parauēture
it be thought / that I haue past my
boundes in this sermon / or haue
sayd any thyng out of tempre / forgyue
hit me: and ye shall forgyue
a man speakynge of very zele / to a
man sorowynge the decaye of the
churche: and consyder the thynge

hit selfe / nat regardynge any foolysshenes.
Consyder the miserable
fourme and state of the churche:
and endeuour your selfes with all
your myndes to reforme it.
               Suffre nat fathers / this your so
greatte a getherynge to departe in
vayne. Suffre nat this your congregation
to slyppe for naughte.
Truly ye are gethered often tymes
to gether: but (by your fauour to
speke the trouth) yet I se nat what
frute cometh of your assemblyng / 
namely to the churche.
               Go ye nowe in the spirite that ye
haue called on / that by the helpe of
hit / ye maye in this your councell
fynde out / decerne / & ordeyne those
thynges that may be profitable to
the churche / prayse vnto you / and
honour vnto god. Unto whom he

all honoure and glorye / for euer
more. Amen.
