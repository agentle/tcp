               Iob. 10. 28: and as for the quantity they were few, so for the quallity they were euill, in regarde of the misery and sorrow which in these few dayes he indured. For who more exercised in miseries then Iob was, who

was harder held vnder the correcting hand of God then hee. For first, God deliuered all that hee had into the hands of Sathan 
               Iob. 1, 12 who did not abate him an inch of all the ill he could doe, him but by degrees brings him to the height of misery The Sabeans tooke away his Oxen and Asses, Ver. 4. which we must needes grant was a great losse. The fire burned his sheepe and seruants V

                  prosie as some say, or the French disease as others thinke, or some other more loathsome disease, and such as neuer man before him felt, doubtlesse it was fearefull and foule.
            
            
               
In all these, it was not the least part of his misery, that these come so thicke one in the necke of another, before the former haue done his full spite. But what comfort hath hee in the midst of these crosses, a man would imagine his wife should comfort him, but alas shee addeth vnto his crosse, and prooues the sharpest corrasiue vnto his soule, when shee bids him blaspheme God and die 
               Iob. 2, 9: and what comfort he had from his friends we finde, Iob. 16. 2 
               Miserable comforters are you all. Hereby I hope you see what cause Iob had to say, Is there not a time of warfare appointed to man vpon earth, and are not his dayes as the dayes of an hireling, as wee haue it in my Text: In which words Two things are obseruable, 
                  1. The sharpnesse of mans life, subiect to many troubles, in these words: Is there not a time of warfare to man vpon earth.
                  
                  2. The shortnesse of mans life, in these words: Are not his daies as the daies of an hireling.
                  
               
            
            
               
For the meaning of the words, you may conceiue them better, if wee enlarge them a little, as if Iob had in more words said thus. As God hath appointed how long euery man shall liue, of which time he cannot come short if hee would, nor go beyond it: So it is Gods pleasure that they shall finde little pleasure, this short shall not be sweete, but as a warfare wherein hee must fight against his enemies, the Diuel, the World, and his owne Flesh: neither may hee giue ouer when he sees good; for as he that is hired, must looke to doe some worke for his wages, for that short time that he hath vndertaken: so must we in the dayes of our liues; they may not bee spent vainely and idely, but in doing good. I must yet come nearer the words.
            
               Is not time determined of warfare to man vpon earth: Some reade thē thus, The life of man is a warfare vpō earth: Some thus, Is there not a certaine time of warfare determined vnto man vpon earth: Som thus, Is there not a day of warfare to mortall man vpon earth: Others thus, Is not time determined to man vpon earth.

The Israelites could not bee deliuered from Egypt, before the time appointed, Foure hundred years they must be in bondage 
               Gen. 15, 13: but when the date of this indented time is out, Pharaoh cannot keep them one day longer, for euen the selfe same day that it came to passe, That all the hoast of the Lord went out of the land of Egypt,

               Psal. 77, 19: a like maruelous worke was at the riuer Iordan, when Israel entred into Canaan, then the waters that came downe

from aboue, stayed and rose vpon an heap, so the people went right ouer Iericho. Iosh. 8. 16.
            The Israelites wandred vp and downe in the wildernesse forty yeares, being oppressed of their enemies, Et in ipso articulis tē
                  poris, In the very instant of time which God had decreed, they were deliuered. Dauid was tossed hither and thither, yet could not obtaine the kingdome before the time appointed came. The Iewes could not bee deliuered from the Babylonish captiuitie, til the seuenty years were expired. The godly expected the comming of Christ, as was foretolde by the Prophets; but he came not till the fulnesse of time was come Gal. 4, 4: when our Sauiour taught and wrought Myracles, the Scribes and Pharisees sought to take him, but they could not till the time appointed of God. The people tooke vp stones to cast at him, Ioh 8, 59 they gaue a Commandement, that if any man knewe where hee was hee should shew it, that they might take him Ioh. 11, 57: but when the time appointed by God was come, hee offers himselfe, saying, Whom seeke yee 
               Ioh. 18, 4. The Souldiers could

not keepe the body of Christ, in the graue, beyond the appointed time, and then, notwithstanding watch and warde, and stone, and seale, they see, and an Angell sayeth it, He is not here, for hee is risen 
               Mat. 28, 6: Why doe the Sunne and the Moone keepe their true turnes and times of rising and setting, the Summer and Winter, and Atumne, and Spring, their settled seasons, but because God hath appointed them Gen. 8, 22: And can wee doubt then but that God himselfe doth keepe his due times, or may wee thinke that that is not the most due time which God hath determined.
            The very plough-man is taught by experience to take his time, when to plough, & when to sow; when to reap and when to gather into the barne, and shall not God that great Husbandman of the whole world, both know and keepe his time, to plant, and plucke vp as hee hath determined; or hath hee not determined a time for man, both to be borne and to die; or hath hee left it in the power of man to liue when he list, and die when he will, doubtiesse no. The time of death none can preuent before

it come, none passe it when it doth come.
            
               The shortnesse of mans life.
               THou hast numbred my steps saith Iob 
                  Iob. 14, 16 & whē 
                  Dauid desires of God to teach him that heauenly Arithmatick to number his dayes, hee did not doubt but God had done it, hee knowes not the number onely, but the measure, both how many and how long the dayes are which wee must liue, as you may see Psal. 39, 4: yea hee that hath numbred the haires of our heads Mat. 10, 30, hath numbred not onely the yeares of our life, but the monethes of our yeares, & the weekes of our monethes, and the dayes of our weekes, and the houres of our dayes, & the minutes of our houres, which point wee cannot passe. Indeed, God doth diuers waies take men out of this life: Some by murther, as Abel 
                  Gen. 4, 81, Some by drowning, as the olde world▪ 
                  Gen 7, 21: Some by burning, as the Sodomites▪
                   
                  Gen. 19, 24: Some by stoning, as the Sabbath breakers, and Achan 
                  Num. 15 36.: Some by being cut in peeces 
                  Iudg. 19, 29: Some by the fall

of an house, as the Philistims 
                  Iug. 16, 30, and such as they vpon whom the Tower of Siloam fell 
                  Luk. 13, 4: Some by a nayle as Sisera 
                  Iug. 4, 21: Some by Lyons, as the young Prophet 
                  1 King. 13 24: Some by Beares, as the scoffing children 
                  2 King. 2 24: Some sawen to death, as Esay: Some hanged, as the good Theefe 
                  Luk. 23, 39: Some crucified, as Christ: But none of these sooner or later then the Lord hath appointed. The same God that hath determined the manner how, the meanes where, had likewise determined the time when they should die.
               
               The consideration of this, may first Vse 1. comfort the godly, in that their liues lie not in the power of men, or malice of Satan, for these indeed would swallow them vp quicke when they are displeased at them, and the godly neuer want the wicked or the Diuels displeasure; you shall see some of the Iewes band together, and binde themselues by an oath, that they will neither eate nor drinke, till they haue killed Paul 
                  Act. 23. 12, but their plot shall bee preuented, and Paul preserued till the time appointed of God. Tyrants may take away the life

of the godly, but they cannot cut off the lappes of their coats, nor touch the skirts of their garments without Gods permission, and he will neuer permit them before the appoynted time. Pharaoh would haue taken away Moses his life often, but God had not appointed it so, for Moses died in the land of Moab 
                  Den. 34, 5, Saul thought to make sure worke with Dauid when he ran at him with a speare, but God had appointed that Dauid should die a naturall death, in his bedde as he did 1 Kin. 2, 10: wee see such men as are grieuously wounded, oftentimes doe not die, as on the contrary, the cutting of a corne doth kill some, what is the cause but the performance of Gods appoynted time in both. Asaph was but sick in his feet, farre from the heart; he

                        〈◊〉
                      12: Hezechiah was sicke at the heart, and at the poynt of death, yet liues many yeares after, because his time determined by God was not yet come when he should die, though in regarde of his disease in the sight of man, the day was come that hee should die. One lies long sicke, yet recouers

because his time is not come, another as hee walkes in his chamber, or sits in his chaire, drops downe and neuer riseth because his time is come.
               To conclude this Vse for the comfort of the godly, though their enemies that seeke to spill their blood be many, and those mighty and malicious withal, yet all these cannot diminish one day of this life which the Lord hath decreed.
               
               Secondly, this may serue for reproofe Use 2. of such as dreame & dote only vpon second causes, and neuer looke to Gods councell and decree. This makes these men cry out and say, when their friends are taken away, Oh it was for want of learned Phisitians about him, yet died of no dangerous diseases, while hee looked to second causes and not to the Lord without whose appointment nothing can come to passe. A Sparrow cannot fall to the ground without Gods guiding prouidence 
                  Mat. 10, 29: nor a bird fall into a snare where no fouler is Amos 3, 5: In the pestilence they cry out of the infection of the ayre, in consumptions of sorrow and griefe, in feuers of cold, in famine of foule weather, in warre of the malice of

the enemies, but Moses would haue men to looke to a higher hand in all these; For it is the Lord, saith hee, that shall smite men with consumptions, and with the feuer, and with the burning ague, and with feruent heat, and with the sword, and with drought, & with the mildew. 
                  Deut. 28. 21. The second causes I know, that is such meanes as God hath appointed for the preseruation of life, must not bee despised, yet they must not be doted vppon; vse these carefully, but commit the successe to God, who onely can blesse these meanes, and will, whensoeuer they may serue for the performance of his purpose and his time appointed, which can by no meanes be either preuented or auoyded.
               Thirdly, this may teach vs to waite 3 Vse. with patience, expecting when our changing shall come, Iob 14. 14. It is not for vs to know the time and season, the yeere or moneth of our appointed time which God hath kept secret to himselfe. It is comfort enough, and powerfull to perswade a patient expectation of our change, to thinke how happy a change we shall haue; Christ shall change our

vilde bodies, that they might be like vnto his glorious body 
                  Phil. 3. 21.: when we haue the world at will, and nothing comes crosse vnto vs, we can be content; wee say to liue as long as the Lord hath appointed, but when we are pinched with pouerty or surcharged with sickenesse, or vexed with sorrow and griefe, then most impatiently we pray, and wish that wee were out of the world, and wee will not waite the Lords leisure; but with the King of Israel we wickedly resolue, be hold this euill is of the Lord, what should I wait for the Lord any longer? 
                  
                     
                        〈◊〉
                      Kin, 6. 23. In these cases, we can alledge Scripture, that it is better to die, then to liue; because Salomon saith, that the day of death is better thē the day of our birth. 
                  Eccles 7. 4 
                  Salomon doth not say that the day of death is good simply, but by way of comparison better then the day of birth; and yet this may seeme in humane sence and reason to be absurd, for there is ioy when a man is born into the world. 
                  Ioh. 16 21 The number of the children of God is increased, life is the gift of God; 1. Sam. 2. 6. How thē can the day of death be better then the day of life. The meaning of Salomon is, that life is

attended with many miseries, for we are borne to labour and trauell, subiect to sickenesses and sorrow, and sinne, nothing but death can deliuer vs from all these; and therefore better is the day of death then the day of birth; yet be it neuer so good, be it better then life, yea, be it best of all to be with Christ: 
                  Phil. 1. 23. Though we haue here no abiding Citie: 
                  Heb. 13. 14. 
                  Though we be strangers and pilgrimes: 
                  1 Pet. 2. 1. 
                  Though soiourners, as all our fathers were: 
                  Psal. 39. 12 
                  Dust and ashes, 
                  Gen. 18, 27 
                  Wormes of the earth; 
                  Psal. 22. 6. Though wee were worse then all these; yet we must wait Gods appointed time. Though the euer-liuing God hath condemned mankinde to death, which is the wages of sinne: and to the graue, 
                  Rom. 6. 23 which is the house appointed for all the liuing, 
                  Iob 30. 23 yet may we not either hasten our death, or digge our own graues, and descend into them before we be dead. Though our bodies bee but houses of clay, 
                  Iob 4. 19. earthly houses or tents rather, 2 Cor. 5. 1. yet may wee not pull downe these houses ouer our heads, or remoue these tents before our Generall giue command, but waite till our changing come. In a word, God hath determined

that we must die, and therefore death should be welcome, when it doth come, but he hath determined withall when we must die, and therfore nothing should make vs weary of waiting, till it doe come.
               
               Fourthly this point duly considered may reprooue such that goe about to 4 shorten their liues, these men presume to appoint their own time, & with a fals key to open this prison of their body, and let their soules depart before God call for it, or giue them any commission vnto it. It is true that God hath appointed this time for these mens deaths in his secret counsell, but it is more then they know; and for ought that they see, they might liue longer if themselues were not the cause, and so they crosse the reneiled will of God, which onely can bee our warrant in all our actions. Againe, though they were so much of Gods secret Counsell, as to know that God had appointed this to be the time, yet they know that God hath not appointed either themselues or such violent meanes to make good his purpose at his appointed time. No, no: it is misery that

makes these men weary of their liues; and therefore like the foolish fish, they will leape out of the frying-Pan, into the fire; out of short trouble here, into eternall torments hereafter. He that will liue godly, must suffer persecution; 
                  2 Tim. 3. 12. hee that will come into heauenly Canaan, must passe through this earthly Egypt; Through many afflictions, we must enter into heauen, 
                  Acts 14, 22 and shal we then cut off the thred of our life, because wee finde some knots in it. Abimelech cut off his owne life, 
                  Iug. 9 54. so did Saul, 
                  1 Sam. 31 4. so did Ahithophell, 
                  2 Sam. 17. 23. so did Iudas, 
                  Mat. 27. 
                        •
                     . and so doe many in their desperate humour now a dayes, by the cunning of Satan, but not without the secret vnsearchable and iust iudgement of God.
               Fiftly, and finally if our time be determined, and that time known to God, 
                  5 vnknowne to man, certaine to him, vncertaine to vs, we must prepare against that time come, we are men, and therfore mortall; weake men, and therefore secure, for we are euery day dying, and cannot long liue, as old men haue death before their eyes, so yong men haue him behind their backs: and betwixt old and yong,

I desire no other difference but this, that yong men may die quickly, and old men cannot liue long, and therefore all must be prepared. Be ye prepared therefore, for the Sonne of man will come in an houre when ye thinke not: Luk. 12. 40. All must prepare, old and yong, rich and poore, great and small, noble and ignoble; old men must prepare, for they must shortly die, they should put their houses in order, Isa. 38. 
                        〈◊〉
                     . they should with sence and sorrow, confesse their sinnes to God, saying, Against thee, against thee onely haue we sinned, 
                  Psal. 51. 4. they should labour for life to be at peace with God and their owne consciences, and if it be possible to haue peace with all men 
                  Rom. 12. 18. Yong men should prepare, for they may die before those that goe crooked with age: they haue no Charters of their liues. It is not policie, nor gay and gorgeous apparell; not eloquence of an Angels tongue, not strong Castles and stately houses, not pompe nor promotion, can take day with death, or perswade the wormes to pitty them, nor preserue their names from perpetuall infamy. These things may procure honour on earth, but no

happinesse in heauen. If all were not subiect to death, yong men might hope to be exempted, but a new ship may as soone be dasht in pieces meeting with a rocke, as one that is old and weatherbeaten, a yong tree may be ouerturned with a whirlewind, as soon as that which is old and blasted, many old men haue out-liued these tha
                     •
                   were yong, but neuer any yong or olde that liued and did not die: Doth not euery man beare about him in his own bosome, that which will bring him to his end: are wee not all sick of the same disease, euen the consumption of our daies.
               
               
                  Time, pretious time, passeth away swiftly, and with it wee passe towardes our end, and like those in a ship, we perceiue it not, and therefore prepare not for it, or thinke not of the danger of it; for as death leaueth vs, so the day of Iudgement shall finde vs. They that build faire and sumptuous houses, are not certaine how long they shall hold them; they that purchase lands and liuings, cannot tel how long they shall possesse them; they that haue gathered in a great haruest, cannot tell whether they shall bee

better by it; they that plant, cannot tell whether they shall eate of the fruit of it; yet all these men are prouident to prepare for life that is vncertaine, and forget death which is most certaine shall come, & more vncertaine when it shall come. Prepare then in health, for it may hardly bee done in sicknesse, or at the houre of death. Sicknesse may be so full of extreame sorrowe and paine, and death so sudden and present, that thou canst not prepare thy selfe if thou would; or if thou doe, yet not so well as thou wouldest: many neglect to prepare themselues when they may, and when they would cannot. So the fiue foolish Virgins might haue had Oyle in their Lamps, if they had lookt to it in time; but afterward, when willing they would, could neither buy nor borrow any. These men consider not how dangerous it is to procrastinate, and p

                   that for two causes.
               First, God doth leaue the wicked destitute of diuine helpe in that howre, I haue called, saith the Lord, but ye refused, ye were in health in the prime

of your time, in the flower of your age, in the heat of lust, hauing by nature corrupt hearts and carnal affections liuing in pleasure, passing the time in mirth, subiect to youthfull wantonnesse and to vnstaidnesse of affection, full of loosenesse, which is the way to lewdnes; of weakenesse, which is the way to wickednesse, then you would not heare, now in your death-bed, ye shall call, but I will not heare, but laugh at your destructiō,

                     o. 1. 24. They that forget God liuing, God will forget them dying.
               
               Secondly, in the time of death men are more grieuously tempted, and therfore it is dangerous to deferre repentance to the dying day. Remember (saith Salomon) thy Creator in the dayes of thy youth, 
                  Eccles. 12, 1. why should wee remember God in youth, because if youth be spent in vanity, commonly old age will end in prophanenesse.
               The Prophet speaketh of Crimson sinnes, sinnes of a double die, if it bee right Crimson or Purple, it is dyed in thred & in the wooll, and that is euer a deepe dye, so if Satan dye vs in our wooll, in our youth before we be men,

before wee be made cloath, it is like to sticke by vs, and to go with vs to our graue. If Sathan make thy youth vnprofitable, of all the ages after, there can hardly any good be hoped for; if the blossome be nipt, where is the hope of the Autumne. Thus much for the first point, that God hath determined the dayes of man how long hee shall liue.
               
            
            
               A Christians combat against
                     1 Sathan.
                     2 The World.
                     3 The Flesh.
                     4 Sinne.
                  
               
               THe second point of Doctrine which doth arise frō these words, is this; Doct. 2. That the time appointed by man to liue vpō earth, is a time of warfare. Men must liue Souldiers, and die Conquerours; liue fighting, and die ouercomming; from the cradle to the graue is a time of warfare; wee haue many enemies, all fierce and furious: 1. The Diuell. 2. The VVorld. 3. The Flesh. 4. Sinne. All these we must encounter and ouercome too, if it goe well with vs; and woe is vnto vs if they ouercome. Conquerors shall be Crowned,
                  
but C
                        •
                     wards shall bee shamed, and the Conquered shall be captiuated.
               
                  The first enemy is the Diuell.
                  
                     SAthan is a great enemy, A roaring Lion going about seeking whom he may deuour 
                     1 Pet. 5, 8: A Lion for his might, roaring for his malice and wrath, with a hungring desire to hurt, going about without wearinesse, seeking through his studiousnesse to deceiue, whō he may deuour with an implacable wrath, to wreake his malice both vpon God and man; for all his paines and pollicy, all his force and fraude aymes at this, that neither God may bee serued, nor man may be saued. When he cannot secretly deceiue by the subtiltie of a Fox, hee runnes vpon men with open mouth, like a deuouring Lion; in peace hee is craftie, in persecution cruell. You may perceiue the Lion by his claw, and iudge of his nature by his names: Hee is called a Serpent, 
                     Gen. 3. 1 and therefore subtile, wise, and craftie: A Tempter, the Tempter 
                     Mat. 4, 3 to perswade, & a Diuell to destroy Luk. 4, 2 whom hee doth perswade; before the

sinne we shall finde him a Tempter, after the finne wee shall finde him a Diuell; kinde in the entrance, cruell in the end. He prooues a Tempter that he may play the Diuell, and that in euery place; hee made warre in Heauen, practised fraud in Paradise, sowed hatred amongst the first brethren, and tares in the wide field of the world. We know tares will grow fast enough of themselues without fowing, yet in hope to haue fewell enough for hell fire, hee will take paines to sow them, and that in the night when others sleepe. In eating hee hath surfeting, in drinking drunkennesse, in generation wantonnesse, in labour idlenesse, in conuersation enuy, in gouernement couetousnesse, in correction anger, in promotion pride, in honours ambition, in talke vaine ostentation, in profession hppocrisie, and backsliding in the Christian race, and in euery blessing of God some secret baite to draw men to sinne. Into the heart hee doth iniect eeuill thoughts, into the mouth euill words, into the members euill workes: He mooueth the merry to be dissolnte, and the mournefull to bee desperate.

What then shall wee doe? shall wee faint and feare, and fly from him; no, then wee are sure to bee foyled; wee must fight it out with him, and resolutely resist him, and he will flie. Indeed wee cannot doe it by our owne strength, flesh and blood are but vnequall matches for spirits of the ayre, as these are. What then, Wee must put on the whole Armour of God, that we may be able to resist in the euill day, and hauing finished all things stand fast 
                     Eph. 6. 15: The first weapon is the truth of God, with this the minde must bee so confirmed and strengthned, that Sathan doe not keep vs continually in doubting. The second weapon is innocency of life, that Sathan doe not extinguish all heat and light of Religion in our soules & seruice of God. The third is an allacrity and chearfulnesse to embrace the Gospell of peace. The fourth is faith, which the Diuell desires to robvs of, because it is the Casket, yea the Castle of all our comfort; and in this warfare both sworde and buckler. Resist stedfast in the faith 
                     1 Pet. 5, 9: and this is our victory wherby we ouercome the world, euen our faith 
                     1 Iob. 5. 4: And the Apostle

saith, Watch yee, stand fast in the faith, gird you like men and be strong 
                     2 Cor. 16 13: VVatch, sleepe not in sinne; stand, flie not to sin
                        •
                      
                     stand fast, fall not through sin; watch, for the Lord commeth to Iudge; stand, for Sathan commeth to tempt; stand fast, for the flesh perswadeth to yeeld; in faith, for Sathan would winnow vs like wheat 
                     Luk. 22, 31: and not winnow vs onely, but also win vs from God. The fift weapon is hope, which in this skirmish must holde vp our hearts. The sixt, is the word of God, which is powerfull to saluation 
                     Rom. 1, 16: which is sharper then a two edged sword 
                     Heb. 4, 11: which is a lanterne to our feet 
                     Psal. 119, 105: which is able to make vs wise vnto saluation 
                     Tim. 3. 15. The last spirituall weapon is prayer, which to the partie that prayeth is ayde, to God a sacrifice, and to the Diuell a scourge. In sicknesse, prayer is a medicine. Hezechias prayed in his sicknesse vnto the Lord 2 Kin 20, 2. In sorrow it is a sollace 
                     Iona. 2, 1.. In trouble it is a comfort 
                     Psal. 50. 15: Prayer ouercommeth the Diuell, and stayeth the hands of God, it is the messenger which relateth our affaires to God faithfully, and bringeth his answere wished for, speedily. God that

would not be ouercome with the brags of the proud Pharisie, was ouer entreated by the prayers of the humble Publican 
                     Luk. 18. 13: To conclude, All these weapons we must haue if we conquer Satan; and all these weapons wee shall haue if we put on Christ.
                  
               
               
                  The second enemy is the World.
                  THe second enemy is the world, and there is a world of enemies in the belly of this beast, worldly pleasures, and worldly pompe, and worldly pride, and worldly prophanonesse, and worldly profits, which all fight together against our poore soules, and fight amongst themselues which shall haue the first blowe at vs. But the loue of the world is the Captaine of them all, which hath carried many captiue. Demas louing the world did forsake the world 
                     2 Tim. 4 10: nay it makes men forsake God himselfe, and become Gods foe; for he that will be a friend of the world, maketh himselfe the enemy of God Iam. 4, 4: And loue not the world saith Saint Iohn, For whosoeuer loueth the world the loue of God is not in him 
                     1 Ioh, 2. 15.

This world is a strumpet which by her beauty doth bewitch vs; a staffe of reede which by his brittlenes doth deceiue vs, when we lie or relie vpon it. The world doth promise vnto men mountaines of gold, huge & high towers of honours, but these are but towers of Babell, which will fall vpon the heads of the builders, and bring them to confusion. The Sea somtime doth hoise vp the Ship towards heauen, but presently it is plunged down in the deep; so doth the world lift vp many men for a time, but ere long they faile of their footing, and fall downe to the bottome of basenesse or beggerie. That part of the wheele which is one while highest, is presently down againe in the durt; so they that to day are in the top of honour, before to morrowe may be brought to deep disgrace.

The world is troublesome as the Sea which cannot rest Esay 57. 20. such tossing and troubling there is in it; It is as brittle as glasse, very bright but quickly broken; The world passeth away and the lust thereof

                  Where the greater fishes eat vp the lesse. Is the world so turbulent and transitory, what madnesse is it then to bee so fast nayled to it in our affections, that wee can hardly bee knockt off from it, or as wee did verily beleeue there were no other world to come. Wee suffer a great deale of trouble which is certaine

to prolong our dayes a little time, which are vncertaine; for this world is not our mansion house; or permanent; but an Inne or rather but a thorow-fair, through which we must passe to our owne house and home: Heere we must so lodge this day, as that we must be ready to depart the next; and though wee loue it neuer so well, and liue in it neuer so long, we shall finde, and be forced to confesse at last, when wee must leaue it; that it hurts many, heales few; promseth much, performes nothing. Let worldly men vaunt of their knowledge, how to get, and keepe, and saue, and thriue; the knowledge is little worth while the world knoweth not God Iob. 1. 10: they may speak of their quicke and stirring spirits, but a better Spirit then theirs hath spoken it, that the world receiueth not the spirit of truth 
                     Ioh, 14. 1

                     Ioh. 16, 8: They may thinke themselues iolly wise men, But the wisedome of the world is but foolishnesse with God 
                     1 Cor. 1

                     Rex, and domineere as Kings here, but Christs kingdome is not of this world 
                     Ioh. 18. 36: Now if any godly soule shall say, how may wee ouercome this world; I will tell him in a word or two, but it is sooner sayd then done: First, Wee must not loue this world, nor the things of this world more then God. Secondly, wee must not liue after the fashions of this world, which are all either vaine or wicked 
                     Rom. 12. 2: Thirdly, Wee must vse this world as though wee vsed it not 
                     1 Cor. 7, 31: Fourthly, wee must not bee seruant to our seruant the worlde. Fiftly, if we truely iudge of the world, of all the pleasures, and profits, and dedelights thereof, as Salomon hath taught vs, who had tryed it well, that all is vanity and vexation spirit.
                  
                  The best but vanity, and the most vexation; and so much for our second maine enemy which is the world.
                  
               
               
                  The third enemy is the Flesh.
                  THe third enemy is our flesh, an enemy in our owne house which lies betwixt our brests and bosome, and therefore more dangerous. This flesh of ours

is a Iudas which doth kisse, but it is to kill; a Dalilah in Sampsons bosome, a Caine to Abel, an Absolon to Ammon, a Ioab to Amasa, and in a word the common cut-throat of our soules. As a moath which is bred in a garment and nourished by it, doth notwithstanding fret and spoyle it, so the flesh doth goe about to eate out our soules, and doth fight against the spirit which giues life & beeing to it Gal. 5, 17: Ciuill warres you know are farre more fearefull then forraine innations: such is this fight of the flesh against the spirit, it is inward, and neare at hand to hurt vpon all occasions, wee beare about with vs our greatest enemy, which will stab the soule, or rob it of all rich graces of the spirit; darken the vnderstanding, dull the memory, fatte the heart, blind the eyes, stop the eares, and strip the soule starke naked of all goodnesse. If wee haue a Pharaoh a bloody Tyrant abroad, wee shall haue a Iudas a plodding traytour at home, and how hard is it to preuent the harmes which such an insinuating and close aduersary may pull vpon vs. Hee that ruleth his owne minde, is better then hee that winneth

a Citie 
                     Pro. 16, 32: He that represseth & keepeth vnder his intemperate passions and violent affections, doth a greater exploit, and more praise worthy, then hee that conquereth Cities, and Castles, and Townes, and Towers, Anger, wrath, couetousnesse, and such corrupt affections are our capitall enemies; I may tearme them our Turkes against whom wee must dayly warre and fight, and that without fainting, least they bring vs into bondage, for of whomsoeuer a man is ouercome, euen vnto the same is he in bondage 2 Pet. 2, 19: Sampson did much hurt to his enemies the Philistims, yet himselfe was ouercome, if not with filthy, yet with fond and foolish loue. Alexander the Great Conquered a great part of the world, yet would hee not conquer his owne anger, or command his drunken desires. Many rule and gouerne Cities, Armies, and Families, yet are seruants to their sensuall pleasures and delights. That Emperour therefore is worthy praise, which ruleth his owne propper affections; If thou wilt haue all subiect to thee, subiect thy selfe to reason. Thou shalt gouerne many, if reason gouerne thee, and rule

many, if thou be ruled by reason, but if thou suffer the flesh, to haue the soueraignty, & set the Crowne on her head, thou shalt be sure to liue like a slaue, and die no better then a beast. But how shall wee ouercome this Enemy that is alwayes at home? I will tell thee, by these meanes, and with these weapons.
                  First, we must obstaine from fleshly lusts which sight against the soule 
                     1 Pet. 2. 11. Secondly, we must tame our bodies by fasting and bring them into subiection 
                     1 Cor. 9. 27. Thirdly, we must mortifie our members 
                     Col. 3. 5.. Fourthly, we must abstaine from all appearance of euill. Fiftly, wee must not pamper the flesh. Sixtly, we must reiect such motions as the flesh doth iniect, and that at their first entrance, the Serpent must be crushed in the shell, the Foxe must bee taken while he is a cubbe.
               
               
                  The last enemy is sinnne.
                  THe last Enemie with whom we are to make warre in this world, is Sin, a busie enemie, because he is a borderer, an inhabitant, an innmate; one that eateth with vs, sleepeth with vs, walketh
                     
with vs, rideth with vs, and meeteth vs at euery turning: as fire in the flint, so sinne is in the seede, it is bred in the bones, and will not out of the flesh, vntill Iosephs bones be carried out of Aegypt; that is, vntill we be out of this World. Sinne is a Iebusite, a seditious neighbour, and an insinuating mate, so hath it eaten into the nature of Man with its canker and contagion, that his affection is infection, his reason treason, and his will wayward altogether, and auerse from good.
                  The more the Law of God doth forbid sinne, the more doth man commit sinne; we run with all might and maine to that which is forbidden, for it falleth out commonly with sinners as it doth with sicke men: Commonly the meats that are forbidden by the Phisitian, are a kind of sauce to prouoke appetitite in the patient, most of all to desire these meats. As swelling waters, the more they are barred their course, the more they rage and swell, and ouerflow and beare downe all before them; so the more the Law doth seeme to barre and bolt the current of committing sinne, and to set the bounds which they should

not passe; the more is sinfull mans nature enraged, and the more the swelling waues of wickednes do ouerflow & make their fultide; the more shold be our care & courage to encounter it, and set our selues to fight against it. Of our selues indeed we cannot ouercome it, but if we follow our Captaine Christ Iesus, it shall neuer ouercome vs. Saint Paul had experience both of his conflict with sinne, and conquest ouer sinne. O wretched man that I am (saith he) who shall deliuer me from the body of this death. I thanke God through Iesus Christ our Lord 
                     Rom. 7. 25. He it was, that was made a sacrifice for sinne 
                     2 Cor. 5. 21, as Ioshua shut vp Kings and Princes in Caues of the earth, and rolled great stones on the mouth of the Caues Iosh. 10. 27: So sinne shutteth vp greatest Emperours prisoners, and rowleth stones, and layeth great stumbling blocks in their way: and as none could ouercome the roaring Lyon, but the Lyon of the tribe of Iuda 
                     Reu. 5. 5.: So none could free men, out of the prison whereinto sinne had cast them, but onely Christ; For this cause Christ tooke flesh vpon him, that so hee might die in

his flesh, & through death destroy death, and him that had the power of death that is the diuell 
                     Heb. 2. 14. So that Christ hath carryed away the gates of death, as Sampson sometime did the gates of Azzah 
                     Iug. 16. 3., and hath by his power preuailed ouer those vncircumcised Philestims, euen sinne and death, and the diuell and hell; and though we be too weake of our selues to conquer sinne, yet we must follow our Captaine Christ, as fast as we can, and as farre as wee may. First, by flying from sinne. Secondly, by dying vnto sinne. Thirdly, by hating all sinne, yea the very garments spotted with the flesh 
                     Iude 23.. Fourthly, by true faith, for that doth purifie the heart 
                     Acts. 15. 9.. And thus much for the fourth Enemie, now take a view of all these together, consider their malice, their might and the multitude of souldiers which fight vnder them, and we shall plainly see the truth of the point proposed, that while we liue in this world, wee must looke to fight and prepare our selues for this Warfare.
                  
               
            
            
               
               A preparation how to die well.
               The first Vse is for instruction, in Vse 1. that we haue so many Enemies to stand vpon our guard, let vs keep watch and ward continually, let vs be as carefull to resist, as our aduersaries are to assault. A carefull watch is the chiefest point in Warre, and therefore this is often commanded in the Word of God; Watch, for you know not what houre your master will come 
                  Matth. 24. 42.: VVatch and pray 
                  Mat 26. 4, Awake to liue righteously,

                  . Vnto this command, God had for our incouragement annexed a promise of no lesse then blessednesse. Blessed is the seruant whom the Master when he commeth shall finde watching 
                  Mat 26 46.. Blessed is he that watcheth

                  Pro. 8. 33.. Christ will cause them that watch, to sit downe at Table with him, where they shall be at ease from paine; at rest, from labour; full without hunger, healthy without sickenesse; and haue fulnesse of 
                     •
                  irth and solace, without any mixture of sorrow or mourning: God is the Center of the soule, as euery thing doth rest in his

                  Center, so our soules shall rest in God: My people, saith God, by his Prophet, shall dwell in the Tabernacle of Peace, and in sure dwellings, & in safe resting places 
                  Isa. 32. 18.. Thirdly, as we haue precept to watch, and promise of blessednesse if we doe watch; so wee haue a patterne and example of watching, worthy to be imitated, for it is Christ himselfe. What Souldier will not be glad to watch with his Captaine? what Christian will not runne to watch, when they heare Christ thus kindly calling them? Could ye not watch with me one houre 
                  Mat. 26. 38.. VVatch, Behold the easinesse, I bid you not fight for mee, or die with me; but watch onely, and that an houre: Behold the easinesse, not a yeere, or a weeke, or a day, but an houre.
               
               Lastly, by watching as wee follow Christs patterne, so we shall be prepared hereby for Christs comming, which will be in an houre that we know not 
                  Luke 12. 40..
               The second Vse serues to teach vs to cast off all carnal security seeing we haue Use 2. so many enemies to encounter withall. The Diuell is another Herod; the World is a flattering Pharasie, the Flesh a treacherous Iudas, and Sinne a seditious Iebusite;
                  
And therefore little cause haue wee to walke without our weapons, or sleep in security. Whē the old world was secure, it was drowned 
                  Gen. 7. 23.. When Sodome and Gomorrha were secure, they were burned 
                  Gen 19. 24.. Whē 
                  Sampsō
                   was secure, his eyes were put out

                     .. As Bankrupts neuer care to pay their debts till the Serieant bee vpon their backs; so many secure men neuer thinke how farre they runne daily in arrerages with God, till they be arrested by death, at the suite of the great Iudge, and so be cast into prison. This security is the Mother of negligence, and high way to destruction; for as the oxe when he is driuen to the slaughter, goeth willingly, because his hope is (if I may so speake it) that he shall goe to grasse in some better pasture, and neuer feare, till the axe be ready to fall vpon his head; or as a foole, when he is led to the stoak
                     •
                  , goeth cheerefully, and neuer

shrinketh vntill his feet bee fast snared therein; euen so many men goe securely forward, wandring in the broad way without remorse of conscience, perswading themselues they are safe, when indeed they are secure, and neuer perceiue their owne folly; till they be insnared in destruction: many are carefull for others, but secure for thēselues; they looke on other mens faults with both eyes, but scarcely with one on their owne; either they will not see their sinnes, or if they see them, they wil slightly passe them ouer without any serious consideration: They cry Peace, Peace, when destruction is at their doores 
                  1 Thess. 5. 3.. They that finde themselues in good health, neuer seeke or send to the Phisitian; and they also that are soule sicke, and dangerously diseased, but feele it not, doe neuer cry after Christ, they seeke little after him, and set lesse by him:
               Thirdly, the hope of a happy reward should encourage vs to wage Warre against those our enemies; He that neuer comes forth to fight, can neuer conquer; & he that doth not conquer, shal neuer be crowned; he that ouercommeth, will I

giue to eate of the Manna that is hidde, and will giue him a white stone, and in that stone, a new name written, which no man knoweth, sauing he that receiueth it Reu. 2. 17.. He that ouercommeth and keepeth my words to the end, to him will I giue power ouer Nations 
                  Reu. 2. 26.. To him that ouercommeth, will I giue to eate of the Tree of life, which is in the midst of the Paradise of God 
                  Reu. 2. 7.. And so often in the same Chapter you may see it to be the posee of all the Epistles; to him that ouercommeth will I giue, either grace, or glory, or both; not to him that steppeth forth into the battel, and starts backe againe; nor to him that draweth his Sword, or giue a blow, or looseth some blood; but to him that ouercommeth, that fights it out till hee haue foiled his enemy and wonne the field. So if wee suffer with Christ, we shall raigne with him; suffer here, raigne in heauen; suffer misery, raigne in glory; for, from the crosse, wee must come to the Crowne. A Souldier must fight before he can winne the victory; he must be a Souldier, before he can bee a Captaine. There is a Crowne of righteousnesse laid vp; But for whom? for such

as haue fought a good fight 
                  2. Tim. 4. 7; and it is not a good fight, vnlesse we 
                     
                        •
                     uercome. The penny of eternall life is promised to labourers, not to loiterers, to workers, not to idle 
                     
                        •
                     wanderers; to those that are in the Vineyard, not to such as stand staring in the market place. Suffer affliction, saith the Apostle, as the good Souldier of Iesus Christ; No man that warreth, entangleth himselfe with the affaires of this life, because hee would please him that hath chosen him to be a Souldier; and if any man striue for a mastery, hee is not crowned vnlesse he striue as he ought to doe 2 Tim 2. 34., and can wee then hope to bee crowned, if we striue not at all. Worldlings wrastle for a corruptible Crowne, as vncertaine whether they shall obtaine it or no; but it is not so with the true Christian, he runneth not as vncertainly, he fighteih not as one that beateth the ayre 
                  1 Cor. 9. 25: Some will say that afflictions and troubles doe hinder many Souldiers that they cannot fight as they would: but the Apostle puts them both together. Suffer thou affliction, as the good Souldier of Iesus Christ, looking to the reward that Christ is ready to giue thee

as soone as the battell is ended. Thy fighting is but for a moment; thy triumph is for euer; thy fighting is light, thy reward heauy; A waight, and excellent waight; a more excellent, a farre more excellent and eternal wayght of glory 
                  2 Cor. 4. 17.. Where God purposeth to heale, he spareth not to launce; he ministreth bitter pils to purge corrupt humours, and sendeth Embasies of death and renenge where he meanes to preserue, and where he purposeth to bestow eternall life and felicitie. Ioseph accused his brethren as spies, when he meant them least hurt, and restrained little Beniamin as guilty of that, whom he knew full well to bee a guiltlesse innocent; but these accusatious were like water in a Smiths Forge, which serueth to kindle, not to quench; it was a rough entrance, to a most kinde vsage; an outward shew of suspition, the more plainly to vtter his entire affection; so dealeth God with his children for they haue gone through fire and water, but he hath brought them out into a wealthy place 
                  Psal. 66. 12. Many goe out of prison and chaines, but their iourneyes end is to a Kingdome, many in

few things are vexed, but in more they are well considered. Though the godly are tryed like gold in the furnace, yet God loues them neuer the lesse for it, but makes them the purer by it: If afflictions be grieuous, yet at the least the godly gaine this by it, that it makes the soule more sober: If God beginne, with I haue afflicted thee, he will doubtlesse end with I wil afflict thee no more 
                  Nah. 1, 12. And as we are partakers of Christs suf

                     erings, so wee shall be also of his consolation 
                  2 Cor. 1, 7: If we die with him, with him shal we liue: And if we bear his Crosse we shall weare his Crowne, God woundeth vs sometimes, but his wounds are the wounds of a friend, for whether hee denounce iudgement, or inflict it, all is for our good in the end. He sent Ionah to Ni
                        ••
                     neh to threaten and ouerthrowe, but his intent was to bring them to repentance, that hee might manifest his greater mercies. He sent Esay to Hezekiah to tel him of his dying day 
                  Esa. 38. 1: but his meaning was to mooue him to amendment that he might adiourne his life yet longer: Hee suffered Daniel to bee throwne into the Denne of Lions but

it was to aduance him to greater credite. Hee that had seene Ioseph in prison vniustly; Mordacay with a gibet before his eyes, would haue bewayled there case, but had hee knowne that Iosephs prison would haue ended in a Princedome, and Mordecay his perill with royall preferment: hee would rather thinke them much beholding to God for the ensuing felicitie, then greatly to be pitied for their present misery.
               The Musitian straineth not his strings to high for feare of breaking, neither doth let them to low, for feare of discord; so God will keepe a meane, neither suffering vs to bee carelesly secure, nor driuing vs for want of comfort to dispaire. Who then wil not warre when hee shall be sure to triumph hereafter; If wee ouercome, we shall goe home to our fathers house

                  : an hireling looketh and waiteth when his day will end that hee may haue his hire; so the godly, desire to bee dissolued and to bee with Christ, that they may receiue the Crown, of glory prepared for thē. Many profitable points might hence bee collected, but the time will not giue me leaue to stand vpon all, onely this I will briefly vrge.
               That man shall then receiue his rewarde when hee hath ouercome, when he hath done his worke, God will not denie his wages, this rewarde is not carnall but spirituall, not earthly but heauenly, not mans but Gods, not merited but giuen of mercy. This reward is layd vp 
                  2 Tim. 4, 8: and it is a Crowne, not of thornes, as on Christs head, nor of gold, as on earhly Kings heads, but a Crowne of righteousnesse, so Paul cals it a Crowne of life; so Iames names it Iam. 1. 12: a Crown of glory; so Peter stileth in 1 Pet. 5, 4: yea a Crowne incorruptible and euerlasting. When thou hearest of a Crowne conceiue a triumph, for Crownes are layde vp for them that after victory triumph ouer the enemy. There is no garland
                  
where there is no gole to runne to, there is no victory, where there is no enemy; there is no hire, where there is no labour; and there is no happinesse, where there is no tryall by temptation: and rather then such as fight the Lords battels against sin and Sathan, the world and the flesh, shall want either Credit or Comfort, God himselfe shall be their Crown. In that day shall the Lord of hostes be for a Crowne of glory, and for a Diadem

                  So runne that you may obtaine this Crowne. Such as wrastle or runne in a race, will diet themselues before hand, and endure much when they come to fight or runne, euen sweate, and pant, and blow, and bleed; how much more should Christians in this course & conflict of Christianitie; especially, considering the enemies with whom wee are to fight and wrastle are farre mightier; for they wrastle but with men made of the same mould and mettall that wee are: wee with principalities and powers, and wicked spirits: the time that we are to fight is farre longer, they but for an

houre or two; but we al the daies of our life, the Crowne for which wee striue is farre better: they did wrastle for the applause and commendation of men, or for a garland of flowers, which did fade in a day: we for an incorruptible Crowne of glory, which God shall giue vs in his kingdome. Let no man looke for his reward in this world, but in the end of the day, that is, after death: then the wages shall bee paid, when wee rest from our worke. As L

               This may serue to let Christians see what a gracious Master they serue, who will not see their worke vnrewarded. The wicked indeed in a pow

                  ing and repining humour, will say as Iob settes it downe Iob. 21, 15: VVhat is the Almighty that

we should serue him, and what profit should we haue of we pray vnto him: But the Christian will gladly confesse, that their wages is farre beyond their worke, for if wee ouercome, the Crowne is not due of debt: heauen is no purchase of ours, but a free inheritance giuen to the godly for Christs sake. Eternall life it the gift of God through Iesus Christ our Lord 
                  Rom. 6, 23: Euery man shall receiue according to his workes, but not for the worth and merit of his workes. The Crowne is of mercy, not of merit, and where there is need of mercy (as what man doth not need it) there is no standing vpon merit. The Apostles reason in this point is plaine: If saluation bee of grace, it is no more of workes, for else were grace no more grace, and if it be of workes it is, no more of grace, for else were workes no more workes 
                  Rom. 1. 6: But saluation is of grace, as the same Apostle hath plainely deliuered Eph. 2, 8: By grace are you saued through faith, and that not of your selues, it is the gift of God, not of workes least any man should boast. Indeed we are created in Christ Iesus vnto good workes, that wee should walke in them, as it followes

in the same place; that we should walke in them, not that we may merit by them. For good workes are the way wherin wee must walke to the Kingdome of Heauen, but they are not the cause that wee are Crowned when wee come there. Good workes wee all know proceed from the grace of God and therefore God cannot any way be indebted to vs for his owne which he giues vs. Doth not Dauid say, all things come of thee, and of thine owne hand, we haue giuē
                   thee 1 Chro. 29 14.. Who hath giuen vnto him first, and hee shall be recompenced 
                  Rom 11. 35. We are borne to doe good, and our whole course must be to walke in Gods commandements, and a speciall commandement is, to bee fruitfull in good works Coll. 1. 10.: As hirelings are busied all day, so must wee as long as we liue here exercise our hands vnto good works.
               
               These are the best apparell of Christians, and their most durable riches and treasures. What one point doth God more presse vs vnto, then this duty of doing good workes, bring forth workes worthy amendment of life 
                  Acts 26. 20. Be zealous of good workes 
                  Tit. 2. 14. And this wee cannot

be till we be in Christ; without me, saith our Sauiour, ye can doe nothing

                  . As a graft can bring forth no fruit which is not set into a stocke: so no man can possibly turne his hand to any thing that is truely and formally good, till he be ingraffed into Christ: and therefore it should be our wisedome and comfort to shew by good conuersation our works 
                  Iam. 3. 13, and our loue to prouoke one another to good works 
                  Heb. 10. 24. A faith busie in obedience, and fruitfull in good works, is the fruits of profitable Preaching, and conscionable hearing; a godly life is the Christians badge whereby he is knowne, it is the Ensigne, shewing whose Souldier he is, and to whom he belongeth. As the pleasant and delghtfull fruit which the Spies brought out of the promised land; shewed that that was pleasant and profitable, so a godly conuersation, sheweth that a man is the child of God, and seruant of Christ.
               
               Last of all, let this serue to exhort all true Christians to liue godly in this present life, & alwayes to look for, yea, and long for death; to welcome and embrace it when it doth come, for there is

no other meanes to put an end vnto our troublesome Warfare, and to put vs in possession of our promised reward, but onely death. The poore Apprentice counts when the date of his Indentures ende, that hee may bee made free; the Day-Labourer lookes when the Sunne will set, that he may leaue worke; The Seafaring man and Passenger is faine when they come within kenne of land, that they may attaine the Hauen; and shall not we, whose Indentures end not but by death; who must not leaue working till the Sunne of our life be set; and who can neuer come within ken of the Hauen of Heauen, till we see some signes of death, welcome it with all our hearts. It is no wonder indeed, if the wicked looke pale and wanne at the warning of death, because they discry beyond death, a day of Iudgement, and beyond that, they behold hell; well may they be deiected, when they feele sicknesse, and almost desperate, when they finde the pangs of death vpon them; for besides the paine of death, euery sinne serues as a Fury to torment the soule, and to make it loath to depart out of the prison of

the body. But the godly who haue wrastled and made Warre here with their spiritual enemies, are glad to heare that the time is come when they shall be crowued. It was a cleare heart, nothing els could doe it, that gaue so bold a f

               ANd now blessed and beloued Brethren; That little Boxe of oyntment which I haue brought for the buriall of this worthy and Worshipfull Knight; I hope you will giue mee leaue to powre forth (for a good name is like a pretious oyntment powred out) and I doubt not but to fill the house with the sauoure of it; and though I cannot sufficiently set forth his commendations, yet I dare not so much wrong him that deserued it, or you that expect it, or my selfe that owe it, as to be altogether silent; lend me your patience then a little, till I discharge this due debt of deserued praise, not to be denyed vnto the dead.
               
               To liue well, and to die well, as they are inseperable companions; so they are the most certaine tokens of a true Christian, and the greatest commendations that in fewest words can bee giuen a man; which whether they bee not due to the deceassed Partie, those that knew

him best can well witnesse, and you will confesse when you shall haue heard the particulars which I can but onely point at.
               The Hebrew Doctors say of their meanest Magistrates, whom they call the Court of three men, that there must be in euery one of them these seuen properties; VVisedome, Meekenesse, The feare of God, Hatred of Mammon, Loue of the Truth, Loue of their fellow Creatures; that is, of other men, and that they be men of good name; and these seuen are indeed the same in effect with those that we finde mentioned in Exod. 18. 21. and Deut. 1. 13. And did sweetly concurre in this Man menaging the affaires of the Common wealth wherevnto he was called; and did carefully and consciouably discharge.
               
                  I. His wisedome.
                  FOr first his wisedome was well tryed and prooued to be sound in his singular dexterity to search into, and his happy successe in putting an ende, to

such Causes and Controuersies as were committed to him; which commonly were as many and materiall, us to any one man; and what was it but his wisedome and mature iudgement which made cunning and crafty Companions, by all meanes feare to come before him, lest they should be detected; and poore ignorant and innocent people so fast to flocke vnto him, that they might be directed, by his direction.
               
               
                  II. His Meekenesse.

practise that precept of the Apostle; which as it concernes all Christians, so particularly Ministers and Magistrates. Gal. 6. 1. Brethren, if a man be fallen by occasion into any fault, ye which are spirituall restore such one with the spirit of meekenesse, considering thy selfe, least thou also bee tempted.
                  
               
               
                  III. His feare of God.

                     Pro. 1, 7: The feare of the Lord is the beginning of wisedome: And the end of Salomons preaching Eccl. 12. 13: Heare the end of all, feare God and keepe his Commandements, for this is the whole man: without this I know not whether men be more foolish or fierce, by this they are made both wise and meeke, and for his feare of God (though this be a sparke which the firy eyes of God can discerne, the fleshly eyes of men may be deceined) yet those that knew him, how duely and daily he

obserued his Deuotions, both for prayer and reading; How willingly and feelingly, hee would conferre of matters of Religion; how deepely hee detested all Poperie and superstition; how diligently he frequented the gates of Gods house; how attentiuely hee hearkened to the preaching of Gods Word, and for the helpe of his memory, would note downe many worthy sayings deliuered by diuers Preachers, which were found in his studie after his death: how wisely he made choyce of such bookes, as may help forward our mortification, wherein hee could not too much commend Master Perkins Workes, the Deceitfulnesse of the heart, and the Practice of Pietie: must needs confesse that hee did indeed truely feare God
               
               
                  IIII. His hatred of Mammon.
                  COuetousnesse & Contentednesse, can no more agree together, then fire and water; & how could he but bee content whose delight was in the Lord; which as Dauid saith, wil bring a man his

                     hearts delight: Godlinesse is great gaine with contentation, not if a man can bee content, for that brings contentation with it, wheresoeuer it comes: And as impossible it is for a Godly man not to bee contented, as it is for a contented man to be couetous; his feare of God therefore frees him from this breeding sinne of couetousnesse: Couetousnesse is cruell, so was not hee; but kind hearted towards all. What Tenant can complaine that hee did ouer rack their rents? what neighbour can iustly accuse him that hee did ouer-beare them in their right? or ouer-burden them with his might? Couetousnesse is alwaies complaining of some thing that it wants; so was not hee, but most thankefully acknowledged Gods goodnesse for that hee had. Couetousnesse keepes no hospitality, hee did; and that not onely vpon good dayes, like some that will kill an Oxe or two at Christtide, that scarce kill a Sheepe all the yeare after: but all the yeare long, yea many yeares together, without euer seeking to liue in some corner of a City to saue charges, as too many far more

able then he, daily doe. Couetousnesse is 
                        •
                     unning and crafty, so was not hee; but like a true Nathaniel in whom there was no guile; hee louing nothing better in others, nor practised nothing more carefully in himselfe, then plaine downe-right honest dealing.
               
               
                  V. His loue of the Truth.

                  VI. His loue.
                  ANd indeed such was his loue to his fellow mēbers, that he took as tenderly what did touch thē, as if himselfe had felt it; his sympathie & fellow-seeling of his brethrens wrongs, made him ready to heare any poore mans complaint, and to helpe them if hee could: sometimes speaking for them, sometimes writing for them with his owne hand; alwayes in his heart pittying the poore and oppressed. Hee knew how fatall it is for members of the same bododie to fall out amongst themselues, and therefore hee was alwaies busie in that blessed worke of making peace: Composing controuersies, and ending sutes of Law; sometimes by faire words, intreating; sometimes by giuing counsell, aduising; sometimes by plaine and and pregnant places of Scripture, conuincing the wilfull: there were not many dayes in the whole yeare (excepting the Sabbath) wherein hee was not sought vnto: and many times would hee sit from morning till night,

hearing and examining such matters as came before him, being demanded by some why hee would sit so long, so tyring out himselfe, spending his spirits, and endangering his health: his answer was, that by his place and calling, and good of his countrey hee was to doe it: and for himselfe hee said hee was as a Candle, wasting himselfe, to giue light to others; disquieting himselfe, to quiet others; and troubling himselfe, to free others from trouble. To conclude, this particular, there are more then many that can witnesse, that as it was said of Iob 
                     Iob 24, 15 16.: so wee may say of him, that he was eyes to the blind, feet to the lame, a father to the poore, and a friend to all.
                  
                  Finally, for his good name, the sweet sauour of it spread it selfe further then himselfe was knowne, and begins now after his death to grow stronger and stronger. Iacobs body was neuer embalmed with so sweet spices, as this mans name and memory is seasoned with the sauour of his vertues; and euer shall be honoured with variety of fresh praises, which not only his godly life which you haue heard, but his gracious death
                     
which in a word you shall heare, will alwaies afford.
                  It is the nature of naturall motions, that the nearer they come to their end, the swifter they are: surely we may easily imagine that this mans motion to heauen was come naturally; such haste he did make thither, now towardes his end. Hence it was that he professed that he was wearie of this world, wherein he neuer found any sound comfort or content: that hee was desirous to goe to his owne home, for here hee sayde, he was but a stranger and pilgrim; not long before he fell a sleep, he cited two verses of the 39. Psalme. The words are these, Heare my prayer O Lord, and hearken vnto my cry, keepe not silence at my teares (and with those wordes wept) for I am a stranger with thee, and a saiourner as all my fathers were, stay thine anger from me, that I may recouer strength before I goe hence, and bee no more seene: What shal I say of his humble Confessiō, that hee was a great sinner, his strong Considence in Christ his Sauiour, that sweete peace of conscience which hee did finde in his foule, by the assured remission

of his sins, and that infallible assurance of saluation, that hee should l
