               Most Excellent Ladie.
            
            
               SIthence it hath pleased your Highnesse, heeretofore to take notice of me, and my labours, such as they were, nothing hath been oftner in my wishes then abilitie to pay the debt I owe to the respect of so peerelesse a Prince, and Princely a Patronesse. But since the more I striue, the more I

am entangled by mine owne weaknesse, I submit to my Fortune, and must rest Captiued in the bands of your gracious mercie. Yet so to be bound, is sweet libertie, and beholding the face of such a Iudge, I read my pardon vpon a brow of Iuorie. But as Fauour is woont to make offendors bolde, so truely I confesse your Fauours haue drawne mee into this, and your Bountie hauing watered some flowers, hath brought vp I feare moe weedes, which perhaps by their ranknesse will rather giue offence, then with their smell or beautie breede you delight. I now present your Highnesse, with a Genethliaque or Birth Poeme, done by mee aswell in Latine, as English Verse, in Honour and the behalfe of young Prince Henrie your sweete and deerest Sonne, the most part in my trauailes heere in the Low Countries vpon the way, without other helpe then a bad memorie, and my Table booke, and now ended vnder the aspect of that star of honour, and Honourer of your Grace and all vertuous Excellence, Sir Iohn Ogle Lord Gouernour of Vtrecht, my noble friend. If any aske why it came no sooner and had not the beeing with the Princes birth, I answere a Poeme is a fruit that had need of a winter to ripen it, I could say with Horace

                  nonumque premantur in annum.
                as Du Bartas saith. Last of all it is a ioy that can neuer come out of season. Yet had these excuses, I confesse bin of no force, had the way to Heidelberge beene free

from danger, during eyther Armies lying at Rees and Wesel, for so farre I was come on my Pilgrimage with this little, lesse then a candle toward your Highnesse the Saint and Soueraigne of my deuote affection, whome since it is papistrie to pray vnto, I cannot, as I am bound, but pray for so long as I liue. I most humbly take my leaue of your Grace: From Vtrecht, the of

            To the same most Excellent Princesse.
            
               DEare Henries losse, Eliza's wedding day,
               The last, the first, I sorrowed and song,
               When laid my reedes for euermore away,
               To sleep in silence, Isis shades among:
               Dead to the Muse, and many-headed throng,
               Through hard constraint of fruitlesse Hope compell'd:
               And Enuie rife, that kills with canckred tongue
               The sacred Bay, so honoured of eld,
               Though left forlorne, ne now, of Phoebus selfe vpheld.
            
            
               Where are the Summers when the righteous Maid,
               With ev'nest hand the heauenly Scale did weild,
               And golden Deed with golden meed repaid:
               When Vertue was in price, for Vertue, held,
               When Honours daintie but desert did guild,
               And Poesie in graces goodly seene,
               Rais'd her high thought, with straines that Nectar still'd?
               Th

                  y are ascended with that glorious Queene:
               And she, alas, forgot, as she had neuer beene.
            
            
               
               But dearest daughter of the greatest Ile,
               Sole glorious Empresse of the Northren Maine.
               Yet thou her glory: Since thou didst erewhile,
               Thy bounteous hand, and sweet supportance daigne
               Vnto my verse, and all vnworthie vaine:
               As humblest Iu

               Else lowly buried in Obliuion deep,
               Who heere had heard me sing thy sweetest babe a sleep?
            
            
               And him againe to waken with my song,
               Which thousand tunes shall variously diuide,
               As Vahale by thy flowerie bankes along,
               I take my pipe at morne and euentide:
               Hence may it downe thy gentle bosome glide,
               And going on, allay th' enraged Rheine,
               
               Where goodly Nimphes with Muses mild abide:
               Who often in his surplusage of Wine,
               Doe teach him Temperance, in songs and layes diuine.
            
            
               Now while I shall beside this cradle sing,
               Leaue Venus Queene a time thy siluer spheare,
               And to mine aid thy daintie dearling bring,
               With Mart appeased after death and dreare:
               But from thy pure and peerelesse excellence,
               
                  Eliza mother, dreaddest Ladie deere,
               Light, life, oh, lend vnto mine eine and sence,
               For vigor haue I none but what I draw from hence.
            
            
               
               And Royall child, who like another Sunne,
               From Rosie bed arised'st in the East,
               When that great light we saw extinct and done,
               Ah Henrie, waild of euery gentle brest,
               Dart one sweet smile vpon me early ghest:
               And that my Muse with thine owue heigth may flie,
               A feather shed from thy faire Phoenix nest:
               So may she teach thy Fame to strike the skie,

            Of all; that was, and euer is to come.
            To after times, I may arightly read,
            The hopefull Haruest of this heauenly seed.
            For, can the bloud, deriued from the veines
            Of so great Princes, such imperiall Raignes,
            Vnhopefull be? and Impe of richest root,

            Or whether this beene that same goodly tree,
            That nigh the fertile Rhine must planted bee:
            Whose fruitfull branch, should Europe ouer-spread,
            And check the Heauen with her lofty-head.

            Should as so many fatall sunnes appeare
            To chase the Crescent from our Hemispheare:
            Or that strong arme expected long agoe,
            Should giue the Byzant beast a deadly blow:

            How Ianiuere, his bitter rage forgot,
            For lustie greene y'chang'd his frostie gray:
            (As if he woed the sweet and daintie May)
            For ioy he brought first tidings of this birth,
            And gaue the goodliest New yeares gift on earth.
