                     COme masters, I thinke it be past fiue a clock,
                  Is it not time we were at worke:
                  My old Master heele be stirring anon.
               
            
            
               1.
               I cannot tell whether my old master will be stirring or no: but I am sure I can hardly take my afternoones nap, for my young Maister Thomas,
               
               
                  He keepes such a quile in his studie,
                  With the Sunne, and the Moone, and the seauen starres,
                  That I do verily thinke heele read out his wits.
               
            
            
               Hodge.

                  Be nobody in comparison to him.

                  Whose black obscuritie binds in my minde,
                  A thousand sundry cogitations:
                  And now Aurora with a liuely dye,
                  Addes comfort to my spirit that mountes on high.
                  
                     Too high indeede, my state being so meane,

                  To send him to the Vniuersitie,
                  How build a house where now this cottage standes,
                  As faire as that at Sheene, he shall not here me,
                  A good boy Tom, I con thee thanke Tom,

                  Why should my birth keepe downe my mounting spirit,
                  Are not all creatures subiect vnto time:
                  To time, who doth abuse the world,
                  And filles it full of hodge-podge bastardie,
                  Theres legions now of beggars on the earth,
                  That their originall did spring from Kings:
                  And manie Monarkes now whose fathers were,
                  The riffe-raffe of their age: for Time and Fortune
                  Weares out a noble traine to beggerie,
                  And from the dunghill minions doe aduance
                  To state: and marke in this admiring world,
                  This is but course, which in the name of Fate,
                  Is seene as often as it whirles about:
                  The Riuer Thames that by our doore doth passe,
                  His first beginning is but small and shallow:
                  Yet keeping on his course, growes to a sea.
                  And likewise Wolsey, the wonder of our age,
                  His birth as meane as mine, a Butchers sonne,
                  
                     Now who within this land a greater man.
                  Then Cromwell cheere thee vp, and tell thy soule,
                  That thou maist liue to flourish and controule.

                  For at your sute I haue arrested him,
                  And here they will be with him presently.

                  Arrest him at my sute, you were to blame,
                  I know the mans misfortunes to be such,
                  As hees not able for to pay the debt,
                  And were it knowne to some he were vndone.

                  Why such as he will breake for fashion sake,
                  And vnto those they owe a thousand pound,
                  Pay scarce a hundred, O sir beware of him,
                  The man is lewdly giuen, to Dyce and Drabs,
                  Spends all he hath in harlots companies,
                  
                     It is no mercy for to pitie him.
                  I speake the truth of him, for nothing els,
                  But for the kindnesse that I beare to you,

                  And to deale strictly with such a one as he,
                  Better seuere then too much lenitie,
                  But here is Maister Banister himselfe,
                  And with him as I take the officers.

                  Which scarcelie stoode me in three hundreth pound,
                  I bought them at an easie kinde of rate,
                  I care not which way they came by them
                  That sould them me, it comes not neare my hart:
                  And least they should be stolne as sure they are,
                  I thought it meete to sell them here in Antwarpe,
                  And so haue left them in the Gouernours hand,
                  Who offers me within two hundreth pound
                  Of all my price: but now no more of that,
                  I must go see and if my billes be safe,
                  The which I sent to maister Cromwell,
                  
                  That if the winde should keepe me on the sea,
                  He might arest him here before I came:
                  And in good time, see where he is: God saue you sir.

               And you, pray pardon me, I know you not.
            
            
               Bag.
               
                  It may be so sir, but my name is Bagot,
                  
                  The man that sent to you the billes of debt.
               
            
            
               Cro.
               
                  O the man that persues Banister,
                  
                  Here are the billes of debt you sent to me:
                  As for the man you know best where he is,
                  
                     It is reported you haue a flintie hart,
                  A minde that will not stoope to anie pittie;
                  An eye that knowes not how to shed a teare,
                  A hand thats alwaies open for reward,
                  But maister Bagot would you be ruled by me:
                  You should turne all these to the contrarie,
                  Your hart should still haue feeling of remorse,
                  Your minde according to your state be liberall,
                  To those that stand in neede and in distresse;
                  Your hand to helpe them that do stand in want,
                  Rather then with your poyse to holde them downe,
                  For euerie ill turne show your selfe more kinde,
                  Thus should I doe, pardon I speake my minde.
               
            
            
               Bag.
               
                  I sir, you speake to here what I would say,
                  But you must liue I know, as well as I:
                  I know this place to be extortion,
                  And tis not for a man to keepe him,
                  But he must lie, cog, with his dearest friend;
                  And as for pittie, scorne it, hate all conscience,
                  But yet I doe commend your wit in this,
                  To make a show, of what I hope you are not,
                  But I commend you and tis well done,
                  This is the onelie way to bring your gaine.
               
            
            
               Cro.
               
                  My gaine: I had rather chaine me to an ore,
                  And like a slaue there toile out all my life,
                  Before ide liue so base a slaue as thou:
                  I like an hipocrite to make a show,
                  Of seeming vertue and a diuell within,
                  No Bagot, would thy conscience were as cleare,
                  Poore Banister nere had beene troubled here.
               
            
            
               Bag.
               
                  Nay good maister Cromwell be not angrie sir,
                  I know full well you are no such man;
                  But if your conscience were as white as Snow,
                  It will be thought that you are other wise.
               
            
            
               Cro.
               
                  Will it be thought that I am other wise,
                  Let them that thinke so know they are deceiu'de;
                  Shall Cromwell liue to haue his faith misconstered,
                  
                     Antwarpe for all the wealth within thy Towne,
                  I will not stay here not two houres longer:
                  As good lucke serues my accountes are all made euen,
                  Therefore ile straight vnto the treasurer,
                  
                     Bagot I know youle to the gouernour,
                  Commend me to him, say I am bound to trauaile,
                  To see the fruitefull partes of Italie,
                  And as you euer bore a Christian minde,
                  Let Banister some fauour of you finde.
               
            
            
               Bag.
               
                  For your sake sir ile helpe him all I can,
                  To starue his hart out eare he gets a groate,
                  So maister Cromwell doe I take my leaue,
                  For I must straight vnto the gouernour.

               Cro.
               
                  Farewell sir, pray you remember what I said,
                  No Cromwell, no, thy hart was nere so bace:
                  To liue by falshoode or by brokerie,
                  But falles out well, I little it repent,
                  Hereafter, time in trauell shalbe spent.
               
            
            Enter Hodge his fathers man.
            
               Hod.
               Your sonne Thomas, quoth you, I haue beene Thomast, I had thought it had beene no such matter to a gone by water: for at Putnaie ile go you to Parish-garden for two pence, sitte as still as may be, without any wagging or ioulting in my guttes, in a little boate too: heere 'wee were scarce foure mile in the great greene water, but I thinking to goe to my afternoones vnchines, as twas my manner at home, but I felt a kinde of rising in my guttes: at last one a the Sailers spying of me, be a good cheere sayes hee, set downe thy victualles, and vppe with it, thou hast nothing but an Eele in thy belly: Well toote went I, to my victtualles went the Sailers, and thinking I to bee a man of better experience then any in the shippe, asked mee what Woode the shippe was made of: they all swore I tould them as right as if I had beene acquainted with the Carpenter that made it, at last wee grewe neere lande,

and I grewe villanous hungrie, went to my bagge, the diuell a bitte there was, the Sailers had tickled mee, yet I cannot blame them, it was a parte of kindnesse, for I in kindnesse toulde them what Woode the shippe was made of, and they in kindnesse eate vp my victualles, as indeede one good turne asketh another: Well would I, could I, finde my maister Thomas in this Dutch Towne, he might put some English Beare into my bellie.
            
            
               Cro.
               
                  What Hodge my fathers man, by my hand welcome,
                  How doth my father? whats the newes at home?
               
            
            
               Hod.
               Maister Thomas, O God maister Thomas, your hand, gloue and all, this is to giue you to vnderstanding that your father is in health, and Alice Downing here hath sent you a Nutmeg, & Besse Make water a race of Ginger, my fellow Will & Tom hath between them sent you a dozen of pointes, & good man Tolle of the Goate a paire of mittons, my selfe came in person, and this is all the newes.
            
            
               Cro.
               
                  Gramarsie good Hodge, and thou art welcome to me,
                  But in as ill a time thou comest as may be:
                  For I am traueling into Italie,
                  What saist thou Hodge wilt thou beare me companie.
               
            
            
               Hodge.
               Will I beare thee companie Tom, what tell'st me of Italie, were it to the furthest part of Flaunders, I would goe with thee Tom, I am thine in all weale and woe, thy owne to commaund, what Tom, I haue passed the rigorous waues of Neptunes blastes, I tell you Thomas I haue beene in the danger of the flouds, and when I haue seene Boreas beginne to plaie the Ruffin with vs, then would I downe of my knees and call vppon Vulcan.
               
            
            
               Cro.
               And why vpon him.
            
            
               Hod.
               Because as this same fellow Neptune is God of the Seas, so Vulcan is Lord ouer the Smithes, and therefore I being a Smith, thought his Godhead would haue some care yet of me.
            
            
               Crom.
               A good conceit, but tell hast thou dined yet?
            
            
               Hod.
               
                  Thomas to speake the truth, not a bit yet I.
            
            
               Crom.
               
                  Come go with me, thou shalt haue cheere good store.
                  And farewell Antwarpe if I come no more.

                  To tell you true, a wilde braine of his owne,
                  Such youth as they cannot see when they are well:
                  He is all bent to trauaile, thats his reason,
                  And doth not loue to eate his bread at home.
               
            
            
               Gou.
               
                  Well, good fortune with him, if the man be gone.
                  We hardly shall finde such a one as he,
                  To fit our turnes, his dealings were so honest:
                  But now sir, for your Iewels that I haue,
                  What do you say, will you take my prise.

                  Two hundred pound, birladie sir tis great,
                  Before I got so much, it made me sweat.

                  His substance all is gone, what would you haue,
                  Yet in regarde I knew the man of wealth,
                  Neuer dishonest dealing, but such mishaps,
                  Hath falne on him, may light on me, or you,

                  On that condition you will set him free:
                  His state is nothing, that you see your selfe,
                  And where naught is, the King must lose his right.
               
            
            
               Bag.
               
                  Sir, sir, you speake out of your loue,
                  Tis foolish loue sir sure to pittie him:
                  Therefore content your selfe, this is my minde,
                  To do him good I will not bate a penie,

                  To let his heany wrath fall on thy head,
                  By whome my hopes and ioyes are, butchered.

                  Before aliue they send me vnto France:
                  
                  Ile haue my bodie first bored like a Siue,
                  And die as Hector, gainst the Myrmidons,
                  
                  Eare France shall boast Bedfordes their prisoner,
                  Trecherous France that gainst the law of armes:
                  Hath here betraide thy enemie to death,
                  But be assured my bloud shalbe reuenged,

               Mes.
               
                  Pardon my Lord, I come to tell your honour,
                  That they haue hired a Neopolitan:
                  
                  Who by his Oratorie hath promised them,
                  Without the shedding of one drop of bloud,
                  Into their handes safe to deliuer you,
                  And therefore craues none but himselfe may enter,
                  And a poore swaine that attendes on him.
               
            
            Exit seruant.
            
               
                  Bed.
               
                  A Neopolitan bid him come in,
                  Were he as cunning in his Eloquence:
                  As Cicero the famous man of Rome,
                  
                  His wordes would be as chaffe against the winde,
                  Sweete-tong'd Ulisses that made Aiaxe mad;
                  Were he and his toung in this speakers head,
                  Aliue he winnes me not, then tis no conquest dead.
               
            
            Enter Cromwell like a Neopolitan, and Hodge with him.

                  My Lord you know the men of Mantua;
                  
                  And these Bononians are at deadlie strife,
                  And they my Lord, both loue and honour you,
                  Could you but get out of the Mantua port,
                  Then were you safe dispite of all their force.
               
            
            
               Bed.
               
                  Tut man thou talkest of thinges impossible,
                  Dost thou not see that we are round beset:
                  How then is it possible, we should escape.
               
            
            
               
                  Crom.
               
                  By force we cannot, but by pollicie,
                  Put on the apparell here that Hodge doth weare,
                  And giue him yours: the States they know you not,
                  For as I thinke they neuer saw your face,
                  And at a watch-word must I call them in,
                  And will desire, that we safe may passe
                  To Mantua, where Ile say my businesse lies,
                  How doth your Honor like of this deuise?

                  Will I O noble Lord, I do accorde, in any thing I can,
                  And do agree, to set thee free, do fortune what she can.
               
            
            
               Bed.

                  Heauens graunt this pollicie doth take successe,
                  And that the Earle may safelie scape away.
                  And yet it greeues me for this simple wretch,
                  For feare they should offer him violence,
                  But of two euils, tis best to shun the greatest,
                  And better is it that he liues in thrall,
                  Then such a Noble Earle as he should fall.
                  Their stubborne harts, it may be will relent:
                  Since he is gone, to whom their hate is bent,
                  My Lord haue you dispatched.

                  O how I feele honor come creeping on,
                  My Nobilitie is wonderfull melancholie:

               Hod.
               I they know they want their pasture; its a strange thing of this vermine, they dare not meddle with Nobilitie.
            
            
               Crom.

                  Desires Cromwells companie into France,
                  To make requitall for his 
                        ã€ˆâ—Šã€‰
                     ,
                  But Cromwell doth denie the Earle his sute:
                  And telles him that those partes he meant to see,
                  He had not yet set footing on the land,
                  And so directlie takes his way to Spaine:
                  The Earle to France, and so they both do part,
                  Now let your thoughtes as swift as is the winde,
                  
                     Skip some few yeares, that Cromwell spent in trauell,
                  And now imagine him to be in England:
                  Seruant vnto the maister of the Roules,
                  Wherein short time where he beganne to florish,
                  An houre shall show you what few yeares did cherish.

                  And as our bountie now exceedes the figure
                  Of common entertainment: so do you

                  Giue former welcome to the thronged tables,

                  And the attendants of the Lord Chancellor.
                  But all my care Cromwell depends on thee,
                  Thou art a man, differing from vulgar forme,
                  And by how much thy spirit is ranckt boue these,
                  In rules of Arte, by so much it shines brighter by trauell,
                  Whose obseruance pleades his merit,
                  In a most learned, yet vnaffecting spirit,
                  Good Cromwell cast an eye of faire regarde,
                  Bout all my house, and what this ruder flesh,
                  Through ignorance, or wine, do miscreate,
                  Salue thou with curtesie: if welcome want,
                  Full bowles, and ample banquets will seeme scant.

                  Tis strange, how that we and the Spaniard differ,
                  Their dinner, is our banquet after dinner,
                  And they are men of actiue disposition,
                  This I gather, that by their sparing meate:
                  Their bodie is more fitter for the warres,
                  And if that famine chance to pinch their mawes,
                  Being vsde to fast it breedes lesse palne.

                  My Lord we Spaniardes are of more freer soules,
                  Then hungerstarued, and ill complexioned spaniardes,
                  They that are rich in Spaine, spare bellie foode;
                  To deck their backes with an Italian hoode,
                  And Silkes of Ciuill: And the poorest Snake,
                  That feedes on Lemmons, Pilchers, and neare heated
                  His pallet with sweete flesh, will beare a case,
                  More fat and gallant, then his starued face,
                  Pride, the Inquisition, and this bellie euill,
                  Are in my iudgement, Spaines three headed diuell.

                  I loue health well, but when healthes doe bring,
                  Paine to the head, and bodies surfeting:
                  Then cease I healthes: nay spill not friend,
                  
                     For though the drops be small,
                  Yet haue they force, to force men to the wall.

                  My Lord no Court with England may compare,
                  Neither for state nor ciuill gouernement:

                  From the poore pesant to the Princes traine,
                  In Germanie, and Holland riot serues,
                  And he that most can drinke, most he deserues:
                  England I praise not: for I here was borne,
                  But that she laugheth the others vnto scorne.

                  Which may be preiuditiall to the state:
                  And though that God hath raisde my fortune hyer,
                  Then any way I lookt for, or deseru'de.
                  Yet my life no longer with me dwell,

                  That liued in him, I tenderd with my hart,
                  But what his head complotted gainst the state.
                  My countries loue commands me that to hate:
                  His sudden death I greeue for, not his fall,
                  Because he sought to worke my countries thrall.

                  For maister Newton, and maister Crosbie sent to me:
                  Last night, they would come dine with me,
                  And take their bond in: I pray thee hie thee home,
                  And see that all things be in readinesse.

                  They shalbe welcome, husband ile go before,
                  But is not that man maister Friskiball:
                  
               
            
            She runnes and imbrases him.
            
               
                  Ba.
               
                  O heauens it is kinde maister Friskiball,
                  
                  Say sir, what hap hath brought you to this passe.
               
            
            
               Fris.
               The same that brought you to your misery.
            
            
               Ba.
               
                  Why would you not acquaint me with your state,
                  Is Banister your poore friend quite forgot:
                  Whose goods, whose loue, whose life and all is yours.
               
            
            
               Fri.
               
                  I thought your vsage would be as the rest,
                  That had more kindnesse at my handes then you,
                  Yet looked asconce, when as they saw me poore:
               
            
            
               Mi. Ba.
               
                  If Banister should beare so bace a hart,
                  I neuer would looke my husband in the face,
                  But hate him as I would a Cockatrise.
               
            
            
               Ba.
               
                  And well thou mightest, should Banister deale so,
                  Since that I saw you sir, my state is mended:
                  And for the thousand pound I owe to you,
                  I haue it ready, for you sir at home,
                  And though I greeue your fortune is so bad:
                  Yet that my hap's to helpe you, makes me glad,
                  And now sir will it please you walke with me.
               
            
            
               Fris.
               
                  Not yet I cannot, for the Lord Chancelour,
                  Hath here commaunded me to waight on him,
                  For what I know not: pray God tis for my good.

                  He is as kinde a noble gentleman:
                  As euer did possesse the place he hath.
               
            
            
               Mi. Ba.
               
                  Sir my brother is his steward if you please,
                  Weale go along, and beare you company:
                  I know we shall not want for welcome there.
               
            
            
               Fris.
               Withall my hart: but whats become of Bagot.

               He is hanged, for buying iewels of the Kinges.
            
            
               Fris.
               
                  A iust reward for one so impious,
                  The time drawes on, sir will you go along.
               
            
            
               Ba.
               Ile follow you kinde maister Friskiball.
               
            
            Exit Omnes.
            
               Enter two Marchants.
            
               1.
               
                  Now maister Crosbie, I see you haue a care,
                  To keepe your word, in paiment of your monie.
               
            
            
               2.
               
                  By my faith I haue reason vpon a bond,
                  Three thousand pound is too much to forfeit,
                  Yet I doubt not Maister Banister.
                  
               
            
            
               1.
               
                  By my faith your summe is more then mine,
                  And yet I am not much behinde you too,
                  Considering that to day I paid at court.
               
            
            
               2.
               
                  Masse and well remembred:
                  Whats the reason the Lord Cromwels men,
                  We are such long skirts vpon their coates,
                  They reach almost downe to their verie ham.
               
            
            
               1.
               
                  I will resolue you sir, and thus it is;
                  The Bishop of Winchester, that loues not Cromwell,
                  
                  As great men are enuied, aswell as lesse.
                  A while agoe there was a iarre betweene them,
                  And it was brought to my Lord Cromwels eare,
                  That Bishop Gardiner would sit on his skirt,
                  Vpon which word, he made his men long Blew coates,
                  And in the Court wore one of them himselfe:
                  And meeting with the Bishop, quoth he, my Lord
                  Here's skirt enough now for your Grace to sit on,
                  Which vexed the Bishop to the very hart,
                  This is the reason why they weare long coates.
               
            
            
               2.
               
                  Tis alwaies seene, and marke it for a rule,
                  That one great man will enuie still another:
                  But tis a thing that nothing concernes me:
                  What shall we now to Maister Banisters?
                  
               
            
            
               1.
               I come, weele pay him royally for our dinner.
            
            Exit.
            Enter the Vsher and the Shewer, the meate goes ouer the Stage.

               Vncouer there Gentlemen.
            
            
               Enter Cromwell, Bedford, Suffolke, Old Cromwell, Friskiball, goodman Seelie, and attendants.
            
               Crom.
               
                  My noble Lordes of Suffolke and of Bedford,
                  
                  Your honors welcome to poore Cromwels house:
                  Where is my father? nay be couered Father,
                  Although that duty to these noble men, doth challenge it
                  Yet Ile make bolde with them.
                  Your head doth beare the callender of care:
                  What Cromwell couered, and his Father bare,
                  It must not be. Now sir to you,
                  Is not your name Friskiball and a Florentine.
                  
               
            
            
               Fris.
               
                  My name was Friskiball, till cruell fate,
                  Did rob me of my name and of my state.
               
            
            
               Crom.
               What fortune brought you to this countrie now?
            
            
               Fri.
               
                  All other parts hath left me succorlesse,
                  Saue onelie this, because of debts I haue,
                  I hope to gaine for to releeue my want.
               
            
            
               Crom.
               
                  Did you not once vpon your Florence bridge,
                  Helpe two distressed men, robd by the Bandetro,
                  His name was Cromwell?
                  
               
            
            
               Fri.
               
                  I neuer made my braine a calender of any good I did,
                  I alwaies lou'd this nation with my heart.
               
            
            
               Crom.
               
                  I am that Cromwell that you there releeued,
                  Sixteene Duckets you gaue me for to cloath me,
                  Sixteene to beare my charges by the way,
                  And sixteene more I had for my horse hier,
                  There be those seuerall summes iustlie returnd,
                  Yet with iniustice, seruing at my need,
                  And to repay them without interest,
                  Therefore receiue of me these foure seuerall bags,
                  In each of them there is foure hundred marke,
                  And bring me the names of all your debitors,
                  And if they will not see you paide, I will:
                  
                     O God forbid, that I should see him fall,
                  That helpt me in my greatest need of all:
                  Here stands my Father that first gaue me life,
                  Alas what dutie is too much for him:
                  This man in time of need did saue my life,
                  And therefore cannot do too much for him.
                  By this old man I often times was fed,
                  Els might I haue gone supperlesse to bed.
                  Such kindnesse haue I had of these three men,
                  That Cromwell no way can repaie againe:
                  Now in to dinner, for we stay too long,
                  And to good stomacks is no greater wrong.
               
            
            Exit omnes.
            Enter Gardiner in his studie, and his man.

                  Howsoeuer outwardlie they shadow it.
                  Yet in their hearts I know they loue him not:
                  As for the Earle of Bedford he is but one,
                  And dares not gaine-say what we do set downe:Enter the two witnesses.

                  When by the law you had deserued death,
                  And then you promised me vpon your othes,
                  To venture both your liues to do me good.
               
            
            
               Both wit.
               We swore no more, then that we will performe.
            
            
               Gard.
               
                  I take your words, and that which you must do,
                  
                     Is seruice for you God, and for your King,

                  One thats an enemie vnto the Church:
                  And therefore must you take your solemne oathes,
                  That you heard Cromwell the Lord Chauncellor,
                  Did wish a dagger at King Henries hart:
                  Feare not to sweare it, for I hard him speake it,
                  Therefore weele shield you from insuing harmes.

               Gar.
               Kill them if they come on.
            
            
               Sar.
               
                  Lord Cromwell in king Henries name,
                  I do arrest your honour of high treason.
               
            
            
               Crom.
               Sargiant me of treason.
            
            
               Cromwels men offer to drawe.
            
               Suf.
               Kill them if they draw a sworde.
            
            
               Crom.
               
                  Hould I charge you, as you loue me draw not a sworde,
                  Who dares accuse Cromwell of treason now.
               
            
            
               Gar.
               
                  This is no place to reckon vp your crime,
                  Your Doue-like lookes were viewed with serpents eyes,
               
            
            
               Crom.
               
                  With serpents eyes indeed, by thine they were,
                  But Gardiner do thy woorst, I feare thee not,
                  My fayth compared with thine as much shall passe,
                  As doth the Diamond excell the glasse:
                  Attached of treason, no accusers by,
                  Indeede what tongue dares speake so soule a lie.
               
            
            
               Nor.
               
                  My Lord, my Lord, matters are too well knowne,
                  And it is time the king had note thereof.
               
            
            
               Crom.
               
                  The king, let me goe to him face to face,
                  No better triall I desire then that,
                  
                     Let him but say that Cromwels fayth was fayned,
                  Then let my honour, and my name be stayned:
                  If euer my hart agaynst my king was set,
                  O let my soule in Iudgement aunswere it,
                  Then if my faythes confirmed with his reason,
                  Gaynst whom hath Cromwell then committed treason,
               
            
            
               Suf.
               
                  My Lord your matter shall be tried,
                  Meane time, with patience content your selfe.
               
            
            
               Cro.
               
                  Perforce I must with patience be content,
                  O deare friend Bedford doest thou stand so neare,
                  
                     Cromwell reioyceth one friend sheds a teare,
                  And whether ist, which way must Cromwell now?
               
            
            
               Gar.
               
                  My Lord you must vnto the tower,
                  Lieutenant take him to your charge.
               
            
            
               Cro.
               
                  Well where you please, yet before I part,
                  Let me conferre a little with my men.
               
            
            
               Gar.
               As you goe by water so you shall.
            
            
               Cro.
               I haue some businesse present to impart.

               Cro.
               
                  Well, well my Lord, you second Gardiners text,
                  
                     Norfolke farewell, thy turne wilbe the next.
               
            
            Exit Cromwell and the Lieutenant.
            
               Gar.
               His guiltie conscience makes him raue my Lord.
            
            
               Nor.
               I let him talke his time is short enough.
            
            
               Gar.
               
                  My Lord of Bedford, come you weepe for him,
                  That would not shed halfe a teare for you.
               
            
            
               Bed.
               It grieues me for to see his sudden fall.
            
            
               Gar.
               Such successe wish I to traitours still.
            
            Exeunt.
            Enter two Citizens.
            
               1.
               
                  Why? can this newes be true ist possible,
                  The great Lord Cromwell arreasted vpon treason,
                  I hardly will beleeue it can be so,
               
            
            
               2.
               
                  It is too true sir, would it were otherwise,
                  Condition I spent halfe the wealth I had,
                  
                     I was at Lambeth, saw him there arrested,
                  And afterward committed to the Tower.
               
            
            
               1.
               What wast for treason that he was committed?
            
            
               2.
               
                  Kinde noble Gentleman, I may rue the time,
                  All that I haue, I did inioy by him,
                  And if he die, then all my state is gone.
               
            
            
               1.
               
                  It may be doubted that he shall not die,
                  Because the King did fauour him so much.
               
            
            
               2.
               
                  O sir, you are deceiued in thinking so,
                  The grace and fauour he had with the king,
                  Hath causde him haue so manie enemies:
                  He that in court secure will keepe himselfe,
                  Must not be great, for then he is enuied at.
                  The Shrub is safe, when as the Cedar shakes,
                  For where the King doth loue aboue compare,
                  Of others they as much more enuied are.
               
            
            
               1.
               
                  Tis pittie that this noble man should fall,
                  He did so many charitable deeds.
               
            
            
               2.
               
                  Tis true, and yet you see in each estate,
                  Theres none so good, but some one doth him hate.
                  And they before would smile him in the face,
                  Will be the formost to do him disgrace:
                  What will you go along vnto the Court?
               
            
            
               1.
               
                  I care not if I do, and here the newes.
                  How men will iudge what shall become of him.
               
            
            
               2.
               
                  Some will speake hardly, some will speake in pitie,
                  Go you to the Court, Ile vnto the Citie,
                  There I am sure to here more newes then you.
               
            
            
               1.
               Why then soone will we meet againe.
            
            Exit.
            Enter Cromwell in the Tower.
            
               Crom.
               
                  Now Cromwell hast thou time to meditate,
                  And thinke vpon thy state, and of the time,
                  Thy honours came vnsought, I and vnlooked for,
                  Thy fall as sudden, and vnlooked for to,
                  
                     What glorie was in England that I had not,
                  Who in this land commanded more then Cromwell,
                  
                  Except the King who greater then my selfe,
                  But now I see, what after ages shall,
                  The greater man, more sudden is their fall.
                  And now I do remember the Earle of Bedford
                  
                  Was very desirous for to speake to me,
                  And afterward sent to me a letter,
                  The which I thinke I haue still in my pocket,
                  Now may I read it, for I now haue leasure,
                  And this I take it is.
               
               He reades the Letter.
               
                  
                     My Lord come not this night to Lambeth,
                     
                     For if you do, your state is ouerthrowne.
                     And much I doubt your life, and if you come:
                     Then if you loue your selfe, stay where you are.
                  
               
               
                  O God had I but read this letter,
                  Then had I beene free from the Lions paw,
                  Deferring this, to read vntill to morrow,
                  I spurnd at ioy, and did imbrace my sorrow. Enter the Leiutenant of the Tower and officers.
                  
                  Now maister Lieutenant, when's this day of death.
               
            
            
               Lieu.
               
                  Alas my Lord would I might neuer see it,
                  Here are the Dukes of Suffolke and of Norffolke,
                  
                  
                     Winchester, Bedford, and sir Richard Ratcliffe,
                  
                  With others, but why they come I know not.
               
            
            
               Crom.
               
                  No matter wherefore, Cromwell is prepard,
                  For Gardiner has my state and life insnard,
                  Bid them come in, or you shall do them wrong,
                  For here stands he, whom some thinkes liues too long,
                  Learning killes learning, and insteed of Inck
                  To dip his Pen, Cromwels heart blood doth drinke.
               
            
            
               Enter all the Nobles.
            
               Norf.
               Good morrow Cromwell, what alone so sad.
            
            
               Crom.
               
                  One good among you, none of you are bad,
                  For my part, it best fits me be alone,
                  Sadnesse with me, not I with any one.
                  What is the king acquainted with my cause?
               
            
            
               Norf.
               We haue, and he hath answered vs my Lord.
            
            
               Cro.
               How, shall I come to speake with him my selfe?
            
            
               Gard.
               
                  The King is so aduertised of your guilt.
                  He will by no meanes admit you to his presence.
               
            
            
               Cro.
               
                  No way admit me, am I so soone forgot,
                  Did he but yesterday imbrace my neck,
                  And said that Cromwell was euen halfe himselfe,
                  And is his Princely eares so much bewitched
                  With scandolous ignomie, and slanderous speeches,
                  That now he dooth denie to looke on me,
                  Well my Lord of Winchester, no doubt but you,
                  Are much in fauour with his Maiestie,
                  Will you beare a letter from me to his grace?
               
            
            
               Gard.
               Pardon me, ile beare no traitors letters.
            
            
               Crom.
               
                  Ha, will you do this kindnesse then?
                  Tell him by word of mouth, what I shall say to you.
               
            
            
               Gard.
               That will I.
            
            
               Crom.
               But on your honour will you?
            
            
               Gard.
               I on my honor.
            
            
               Crom.
               
                  Beare witnesse Lords,
                  Tell him when he hath knowne you,
                  And tried your faith but halfe so much as mine,
                  Heele finde you to be the falsest harted man
                  In England: Pray tell him this.
               
            
            
               Bed.
               Be patient good my Lord in these extreames.
            
            
               Crom.
               
                  My kinde and honorable Lord of Bedford,
