            A mad VVorld, my Maſters.

                  Captaine, Regent, Principall,
               
               
                  Anti.
                  What ſhall I call thee?
                  The Noble ſparke of bounty;
                  The life-bloud of Society.
               
               
                  Folly-w.
                  Call mee your Forecaſt, you whoreſons, when you come drunk out of a Tauerne, t'is I muſt caſt your plots into forme ſtil; tis I muſt manage the Pranck, or Ile not giue a louſe for the proceeding: I muſt let flie my ciuil fortunes, turne wilde-braine, lay my wits vpo'th Tenters, you raskals, to maintaine a company of villaines, whom I loue in my very ſoule and conſcience.
               
               
                  Lieft.
                  A ha, our little forecaſt.
               
               
                  Folly-w.
                  Hang you, you haue bewitcht me among you, I was as well giuen till I fell to be wicked, my Grandſire had hope of me, I went all in blacke, ſwore but a Sundaies, neuer came home drunke, but vpon faſting nights to clenſe my ſtomacke; ſl'id now I'me quite altered, blowne into light colours, let out othes by'th minute, ſit vp late till it bee early, drinke drunke till I am ſober, ſincke downe dead in a Tauerne, and riſe in a Tabacco-ſhop: her's a transformation: I was wont yet to pitie the ſimple, and leaue e'm ſome money: ſl'id, now I gull e'm without conſcience; I goe without order, ſweare without number, gull without mercie, & drinke without meaſure.
               
               
                  
                  Lieft.
                  I deny the laſt, for if you drinke nere ſo much, you drinke within meaſure.
               
               
                  Folly-w
                  How proue you that ſir?
               
               
                  Lieft.
                  Becauſe the drawers neuer fill their pots.
               
               
                  Folly-w
                  Maſle that was well found out all drunkerds may lawfully ſay, they drinke within meaſure by that tricke, dna now I'me put i'th mind of a tricke can you keepe your countenance villaines? yet I am a foole to aske that, for how can they keepe their countenance that haue loſt their credits?
               
               
                  Ants.
                  I warrant you for bluſhing Captaine.
               
               
                  Folly-w.
                  I eaſily beleeue that Antient, for thou loſt thy colours once; Nay faith as for bluſhing, I thinke ther's grace little enough amongſt you all, tis lent in your cheekes, the flag's downe; wel, your bluſhing face I ſuſpect not, nor indeed greatly your laughing-face, vnleſſe you had more money in your purſes: then thus compendiouſly now, you all know the poſſibilities of my hereafter fortunes, and the humor of my frolike Grandſire Sir Bounteous Progreſſe; whoſe death makes all poſſible to me: I ſhall haue all, when he ha's nothing; but now he ha's all, I ſhall haue nothing: I thinke one minde runnes through a million of e'm; they loue to keepe vs ſober all the while the're aliue, that when the're dead we may drinke to their healths; they cannot abide to ſee vs merry all the while the're aboue ground; and that makes ſo many laugh at their fathers funerals: I know my Grandſire has his Will in a Boxe, and has bequeath'd all to me, when he can carry nothing away; but ſtood I in neede of poore tenne pounds now, by his will I ſhould hang my ſelte e're I ſhould get it, ther's no ſuch word in his Will I warrant you, nor no ſuch thought in his mind.
               
               
                  Lieft.
                  You may build vpon that Captaine.
               
               
                  Folly w.
                  Then ſince hee ha's no will to doe me good as long as he liues; by mine owne will, Ile doe my ſelfe good before he dies, and now I arriue at the purpoſe. You are not ignorant I'me ſure, you true and neceſſary implements of miſchiefe; firſt, that my Grandſier Sir Bounteous Progreſſe is a Knight of thouſands, and therefore no Knight ſince one

thouſand ſixe hundred: next, that he keepes a houſe like his name Bounteous, open for all commers: thirdly and laſtly, that hee ſtands much vpon the glory of his complement, variety of entertainement, together with the largenes of his Kitchin, longitude of his Buttery, and fecunditie of his Larder, and thinkes himſelfe neuer happier then when ſome ſtiffe L. or great Counteſſe alights, to make light his diſhes: theſe being well mixt together may giue my proiect better encouragement, and make my purpoſe ſpring forth more fortunate: to be ſhort, and cut off a great deale of durty way; Ile downe to my Grandſire like a L.

                  How Captaine?
               
               
                  Folly-w.
                  A French ruffe, a thinne beard, and a ſtrong perfume will doo't: I can hire blew coats for you all by Weſtminſter clocke, and that colour will be ſooneſt beleeued.
               
               
                  Lieft.
                  But prethee Captaine?
               
               
                  Folly.
                  Puſh, I reach paſt your fadomes; you deſire crowns.

                  From the crowne of our head, to the ſole of our foot bully.
               
               
                  Folly-w.
                  Why carry your ſelues but probably, and carry away enough with your ſelues.

                  Sweete M. Folly-wit..
                  
                  Exit
                  Heer's a mad braine a'th firſt, whoſe prankes ſcorne to haue preſidents; to be ſecond to any; or walke beneath any: madcaps inuentions, has plaid more trickes then the cardes can allow a man, and of the laſt ſtampe too, hating imitation, a fellow, whoſe onely glory is to be prime of the company; to be ſure of which, he maintaines all the reſt: hee's the Karion, and they the Kytes that gorge vpon him.
                  But why in others doe I checke wilde paſſions,
                  And retaine deadly follies in my ſelfe?
                  I taxe his youth of common receiu'd riot,
                  Times Comicke flaſhes, and the fruits of blood;
                  
                     And in my ſelfe ſooth vp adulterous motions,
                  And ſuch an appetite that I know dams me,
                  Yet willingly embrace it, loue to Harebraines wife,
                  Ouer whoſe howers and pleaſures her ſicke husband
                  With a fantaſticke but deſerud ſuſpect,
                  Beſtowes his ſerious time in watch and ward;
                  And therefore I'me conſtraind to vſe the meanes
                  Of one that knowes no meane, a Curtizan,
                  One poyſon for another, whom her husband
                  Without ſuſpition innocently admits
                  Into her company, who with tried art
                  Corrupts and looſens her moſt conſtant powers,
                  Making his ielouſy more then halfe a wittoll,
                  Before his face plotting his owne abuſe,
                  To which himſelfe giues ayme.
                  Enter Curtizan.
                  Whilſt the broad arrowe with the forked head
                  Miſſes his browe but narrowly; ſee here ſhe comes,
                  The cloſe Curtizan, whoſe mother is her bawde.

                  Curtiz.
                  Y'are the fortunate man ſir, Knight a'th holland skirt: there wants but opportunitie and ſhee's waxe of your owne faſhioning, ſhe had wrought her ſelfe into the forme of your loue before my art ſet finger to her.

                  Sigh not M. Penitent, truſt the managing of the buſines with me, tis for my credite now to ſee't well finiſh't: if I do you no good ſir, you ſhall giue me no money ſir.

                  I am arriu'd at the Court of conſcience; A Curtizan! O admirable times! honeſtie is remoued to the Common place. Farewell Lady.

                  Curtiz.
                  Oh from ſir Bounteous Progreſſe: hee's my keeper in deed, but ther's many a peece of veniſon ſtolne that my keeper wots not on; theres no parke kept ſo warily, but looſes fleſh one time or other; and no woman kept ſo priuately, but may watch aduantage to make the beſt of her pleaſure: and in common reaſon one keeper cannot be enough for ſo proud a parke as a woman.
               
               
                  Moth.
                  Hold thee there girle.

                  Euery part of the world ſhootes vp daily into more ſubtilty: the very ſpider weaues her caules with more art and cunning, to entrap the flie.
                  The ſhallow ploughman can diſtinguiſh now,
                  Twixt ſimple truth and a diſſembling browe.
                  Your baſe mechanick fellow can ſpy out
                  A weakenes in a L. and learnes to floute.
                  How do'ſt behooue vs then that liue by ſleight,

                  I ſhall once ſee thoſe golden daies agen:
                  Tho fifteene, all thy may den heads are not gone:
                  The Italian is not ſerude yet, nor the French:
                  The Britiſh men come for a dozen at once,
                  They ingroſſe all the market, Tut my girle,
                  Tis nothing but a politicke conueyance;
                  A ſincere carriage, a religious eyebrowe
                  That throwes their charmes ouer the worldlings ſenſes;
                  And when thou ſpieſt a foole that truely pities
                  The falſe ſprings of thine eyes,
                  
                     And honorably doates vpon thy loue,
                  If he be rich, ſet him by for a husband;

                  Her's a Captaine worth the following, and a wit worth a mans loue and admiring!
               
               Enter with Sir Bounteous in his night-gowne.
               
                  Sir Boun.
                  Oh gentlemen, and you be kind gentlemen, what countrimen are you?

                  Folly-w.
                  And why ſhould you be glad of that?
               
               
                  Sir Boun.
                  Oh, the honeſteſt theeues of all come out of Linconſheere; the kindeſt naturde Gentlemen; the'le rob a man with conſcience: they haue a feeling of what they go about, and will ſteale with teares in their eies: ah pitifull gentlemen.
               
               
                  Folly-w.
                  Puſh, Money, money, we come for money.
               
               
                  Sir Boun.
                  Is that all you come for? Ah what a beaſt was I to put out my money tother day: alas good gentlemen, what ſhift ſhall I make for you? pray come agen another time.

                  Sir Boun.
                  Oh not ſo loud ſir, you're too ſhrill a Gentleman; I haue a L. lies in my houſe, I would not for the world his honour ſhould be diſquieted.
               
               
                  Folly-w.
                  Who my L. Owemuch? we haue tooke order with him before hand, he lies bound in his bed and al his followers.
               
               
                  Sir Boun.
                  Who my L? bound my L? Alas what did you meane to bind my L? he could keepe his bed well enough without binding: y'aue vndon me i'nt already, you need rob me no farder.
               
               
                  Folly-w.
                  Which is the Key, come?
               
               
                  Sir Boun.
                  Ah I perceiue now, y'are no true Linconſheere ſpirits; you come rather out of Bedforeſheere, we cannot lie quiet in our beds for you: ſo, take enough my Maſters; ſpur a free horſe, my name's ſir Bounteous, a merry world yfaith; what Knight but I keepe open houſe at midnight? well, there ſhould be a conſcience, if one could hit vppon't.
               
               
                  Folly-w.
                  Away now, ceaze vpon him, binde him.
               
               
                  Sir Boun.
                  Is this your Court of equity? why ſhould I be bound for mine owne money? but come, come, bind me, I haue neede on't; I haue beene too liberall to night, keepe in my hands: nay, as hard as you liſt; I am too good to beare my L. company, you haue watcht your time my Maſters; I was Knighted at Weſtminſter, but many of theſe nights will make me a Knight of Windſor; y'aue deſerude ſo well my

Maſters; I bid you all to dinner to morrow, I would I might haue your companies yfaith, I deſire no more.
               
               
                  Folly-w.
                  Oh ho ſir!
               
               
                  Sir Boun.
                  Pray meddle not with my Organs, to put e'm out of tune.
               
               
                  Folly-w.
                  Oh no, heeres better muſicke ſir.
               
               
                  Sir Boun.
                  Ah pox feaſt you.
                  Exit.
               
               
                  Folly-w.
                  Diſpatch with him, away; ſo, thanke you good Grandſire; this was bounteouſly done of him yfaith; it came ſomewhat hard from him at firſt; for indeed nothing comes ſtiffe from an old man but money: and he may well ſtand vpon that, when he has nothing elſe to ſtand vpon: where's our Port-mantua?
               
               
                  Leift.
                  Here Bully-Captaine.
               
               
                  Folly-w.
                  In with the purchaſe, t'will lie ſafe enough there vnder's noſe I warrant you: what, is all ſure?
                  Enter Antient.

                  Folly-w.
                  You know what followes now, one villane binds his fellowes; go, we muſt be all bound for our owne ſecurities raskals, there's no dallying' vppo'th point; you conceit me: there is a L. to be found bound in the morning, and al his followers, can you picke out that L. now?
               
               
                  Leift.
                  O admirable ſpirit!
               
               
                  Folly-w.
                  You nere plot for your ſafeties, ſo your wants be ſatisfied.
               
               
                  Anti.
                  But if we binde one another, how ſhall the laſt man be bound?
               
               
                  Folly-w.
                  Pox on't, Ile haue the footman ſcape.

                  Thats I, I thanke you ſir.
               
               
                  Folly-w.
                  The Footman of all other will be ſuppoſde to ſcape, for he comes in no bed all night; but lies in's clothes, to be firſt ready i'th morning: the horſe and he lies in litter together; that's the right faſhion of your bonny Footman: and his freedome will make the better for our purpoſe; for we muſt haue one i'th morning to vnbinde the Knight, that we may haue our ſport within our ſelues: we now arriue at the moſt tickliſh point, to rob, and take our eaſe, to be theeues and

lie by't, looker to't lads, it concernes euery mans gullet; Ile not haue the jeſt ſpoilde, that's certaine, tho it hazard a windepipe: Ile either go like a L. as I came, or be hangd like a theeſe as I am; and that's my reſolution.
               
               
                  Leift.

                  Oh M. Penitent Brothel!
               
               
                  M. Pen.
                  What is't ſweet Lady Gulman, that ſo ſeazes on thee with rapture and admiration?
               
               
                  Curtiz.
                  A thought, a tricke, to make you ſir eſpecially happy, and yet I my ſelfe a ſauer by it.
               
               
                  M. Pen.
                  I would embrace that Lady with ſuch courage, I would not leaue you on the looſing hand.
               
               
                  Curt.
                  I wil giue truſt to you ſir, the cauſe then why I raiſde you from your bed ſo ſoone; wherein I know ſighs would not let you ſleepe, thus vnderſtand it: You loue that woman (M. Harebraines wife) Which no inuented meanes can crowne with freedome, For your deſires and her owne wiſh, but this, Which in my ſlumbers did preſent it ſelfe.
               
               
                  M. Pen.
                  I'me couetous Lady.
               
               
                  Curtiz.
                  you know her husband lingring in ſuſpect, Lockes her from all ſociety, but mine.
               
               
                  M. Pen.
                  Moſt true.
               
               
                  Curtiz.
                  I onely am admitted, yet hitherto That ha's done you no reall happines; by my admittance I cannot performe that deed, that ſhould pleaſe you, You know: wherefore thus I'ue conuaid'd it, Ile counterfet a fit of violent ſickenes.
               
               
                  M.Pen.
                  Good.
               
               
                  Curtiz.
                  Nay tis not ſo good by my faith, but to doe you good.
               
               
                  M. Pen.
                  And in that ſenſe I call'd it, but take me with you Lady; would it be probable enough to haue a ſickenes ſo ſuddenly violent?
               
               
                  Curtiz.
                  Puh, all the world knows women are ſoone down;

we can be ſicke when we haue a mind to't, catch an ague with the wind of our fans, ſurfet vpon the rumpe of a Larke, and beſtow ten pound in phyſick vpon't; we're likeſt our ſelues when we're down: tis the eaſieſt Art and cunning for our ſect to counterfeit ſicke, that are alwaies full of ſits when we are well; for ſince we were made for a weake imperfect creature, we can ſit that beſt that we are made for: I thus tranſlated, and your ſelfe ſlipt into the forme of a Phyſition.
               
               
                  M. Pen.
                  I a Phyſition Lady, talke not on't I beſeech you, I ſhall ſhame the whole Colledge.
               
               
                  Curt.
                  Tutman, any guackſaluing termes will ſerue for this purpoſe; for I am pitifully hanted with a brace of elder brothers, new perfumde in the firſt of their fortunes, and I ſhall ſee how forward their purſes will be to the pleaſing of my pallat, and reſtoring of my health; lay on load enough vpon e'm, and ſpare e'm not, for the're good plump fleſhly Aſſes, and may well enough beare it: let gold, Ambre, and diſſolued Pearle, be common ingrediences, and that you cannot compoſe a culliſſe without e'm: put but this cunningly in practiſe, it ſhall bee both a ſufficient recompence for all my paines in your loue, and the readie meanes to make Miſtris Harebraine; way, by the viſiting of me to your mutuall deſired company.
               
               
                  M.Pen.
                  I Applaud thee, kiſſe thee, and wil conſtantly embrace it.

                  Sir Boun.
                  Ah poore honeſt footman, how didſt thou ſcape this maſſacre?

                  Curt.
                  O no, lay your hand here Miſtris Harebraine: I there, Oh there, there lies my paine good gentlewoman: ſore? Oh I, I can ſcarce endure your hand vppon't.

                  Where theſe two ſisters raigne not, luſt of pride;
                  He as much trembles at a conſtant mind
                  As looſer fleſh at him,—be not diſmayde:
                  Spring ſoules for ioy, his policies are betrayde;
                  Forgiue me miſtriſſe Hargraue, on whoſe ſoule
                  The guilt hangs double,
                  My luſt and thy enticement: both I challenge,
                  And therefore of due vengeance it appeard
                  To none but me to whome both ſins inher'd;
                  What knowes the lecher when he clips his whore
                  Whether it be the Diuell his parts adore:
                  They're both ſo like, that in our Naturall ſence,
                  I could diſcerne no change nor difference.
                  No maruell then times ſhould ſo ſtretch and turne
                  None for Religion, all for pleaſure burne.
                  Hot zeale into hot luſt is now tranſformde,
                  Grace into paynting, charity into clothes,
                  Faith into falſe hayre, and put off as often,
                  Theres nothing but our vertue knowes a meane,
                  He that kept open houſe now keepes a Queane.
                  He will keep open ſtill, that he commends,
                  And there he keeps a table for his friends:
                  And ſhe conſumes more then her Sire could hoord,
                  
                     Being more common then his houſe or boord:
                  Enter Hargraue.
                  Liue honeſt, and liue happy, keep thy vowes,
                  Shees part a Virgin whom but one man knowes:
                  Embrace thy husband, and beſide him none,
                  Hauing but one heart, giue it but to one.
               
               
                  Wife.
                  I vow it on my knees, with teares true bred
                  No man ſhall euer wrong my husbands bed.

                  Mother.

                  Folly.
                  Of her honour? ſlid 'ime ſure I cannot get her maiden head with breathing vpon her, nor can ſhe looſe her honour in her tongue.
               
               
                  Mother.
