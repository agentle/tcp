The ſeconde cauſe may be that we ſh
                  •
               lde know our owne Infirmyte / and that is full prouffytable. for as ſaynt gregory ſayth / It is a grete refeccōn a man to ſee & knowe his owne Imperfeccyon / The thyrde cauſe is for man ſholde not holde hymſelfe ſiker For grete truſt of ſikernes engendreth necligence & preſūpcion / and thoſe two togyder inobedyēce / The fourth canſe is that we ſholde the more beſely ſeke hym / wepe and crye after hym / as the chylde after the moder / The fyfth cauſe is that we ſholde receyue his comyng after his wythdrawyng wyth more Joye & gladneſſe / The ſixte cauſe is that the ſholde be the more wyſe

and the more ſtronge to kepe hym Whan we haue hym All thiſe cauſes of wythdrawynge ben but for our prouffyte after goddes ordenaunce / But other cauſes there may. be for our owne defawtes / ſomtyme for necligence / & ſomtyme for vnkūnyng vnkyndnes: Therfore this cauſe of wythdrawēg I wyll declare in partie / for Itrow it be ſpe defull to men & wymen in her beginyng to knowe of this matere whā they fele ſwetnes or deuocōn in ghoſtly liuyng. After the ſayenge of the phyloſophers: Whan ye ſee the ſon̄e is hye in the mydſe of may / thēne hath the ſonne dowble vertue of werkyng in trees herbes & all thyng that is growyng. yf ye planetes then̄e whiche gouerne the nature be well ordeyned / after that the tyme of the yere aſkith / Then̄e draweth the ſon̄e the humours vp in to the ayre / of the whiche comen dewe & rayne wherby the fruyte of the erthe prouffyteth / & is multeplied. ¶ Now to our purpoſe / in the ſame maner̄ / whan that clere ſone our lorde Iheſu is lifte vp in oure hertes aboue all other thynges of our kynde / thenne yf bodely dyſpoſicyon be well ruled after dyſcrecōn Yf vertues. whiche I clepe ghoſtly humours ben enhabyted by longe exercyſe. whyche vertues ſhall be preſented wyth thankynges / and worſhyppes to that clere ſonne iheſu / Then̄e ſomtyme of al thiſe vertues cometh a ſwete rayn of an inwarde beholdynge. and an heuenly dewe of the ſwetnes of the godhede. This is a ſpecyall werkyng of our lorde Ihu cryſt in hertes of his louers / And in all his louyd chyldern. of this heuēli ſwetnes cometh ſuche a likyng to the herte & to all the body. that it ſemeth a man Inwardly / that fully he is beclipped wyth the loue of god / This likynge is more delectable to the body. & ſoule than all the myrthe & likyng that all the worlde myghte gyue for the tyme: In this likynge god ſendeth in to the herte ſoo grete ſauours / comfortes. by gyftes of gladnes. that it thinketh for the tyme he is fulfullid wyth gyftes of goſtly comfort / And of this comith a ghoſtly dronken̄es. whiche falleth to dyuers mē in many dyuers maners / This maner dronkenes makyth ſome men ſinge & worſhyppe god for fulfylling of gladnes / Some men in that tyme ſtirynge wyth all the membres of her body ſoo that they muſt ſkyppe or ren̄e or daunce / Some for Joye bete her hondes togyder / Some crye lowde wyth an hye woys / Some ben ſtille & maye not ſpeke.
