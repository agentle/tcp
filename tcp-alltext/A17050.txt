            TO THE MAIST HIGH, PVISSANT, AND CHRISTIAN Prince, IAMES the ſixt, King of Scots: grace and peace from God the Father, and our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.
            
               PLeaſe ȝour Maieſty, Iwes not of minde at the firſt, that this warkeſuld haue commed out in my time: For the conſcience of my awn weaknes, teſtifies vnto me, that nathing worthy of light can proceed from ſik a ane: Ȝit notwithſtanding, being ouercome at the laſt, be the inſtant ſute of our Kirk and Seſsion, Iwes content, that their authoritie ſuld command mee in this. And gifit ſall pleaſe the Lord to bleſſe it, in ſick ſort, that poore and ſimple anes▪ may finde, ather comfort or inſtructioun in it:

ſuppoſe learned eares finde na conteniment, I will thinke my ſelfe aboundantly ſatisfied: For ſeeing God hes ſanctified mee in ſome meaſure to his warke, it mann bee an argument of his euerlaſting bleſsing, that giff, quhill life laſteth, it may be imployed alway to the profite of his Kirke: For quha am I, that ſuld not imploy his awin graces to his awin glorie? and I pray God, that it may bee found in that great day, that howe meane that euer they be, ȝit they were accompanied with this ſpeciall grace, that they were wel vſed. And ſuppoſe ȝee be ane King, Sir, of this kingdoome preſentlie, and Apparent of anevther: Ȝit thinke with Ȝour ſelfe, that all ȝour magnificence, honor, wealth, libertie, and all the rare gifts, quhilk God of his mercie hes planted in Ȝou, cannot be vtherwayis weill imployed, except they be imployed to the defence of the trueth, and of that pure and ſyncere diſcipline, grounded thervpon: quhilk to Ȝour Maieſties great praiſe, and to our ſingular comfort, hes this lang time, be ȝour M. authoritie bene eſtabliſhed

in this Countrey: For this ſort of doing ſhawes, that God hes not onely made ȝou an heire to earthlie kingdomes, but alſo hes appointed ȝou, to be ane fellow▪ heir with Ieſus Chriſt, of that immortall kingdome, and glorious Crowne, that cannot fade or fall away. And as Ȝour M. life and libertie, hes hithertils bene conioyned, with the ſtanding and libertie of Ieſus Chriſts kingdome with in ȝour Countrey: continue and ſtick be this libertie: and, na doubt, Ieſus Chriſt ſal ſtick be ȝou. I will not faſh ȝour M. with monie words: onely this I doe Ȝour M. to wit, that I cleeth not this warke with ȝour M. name and authoritie, for onie worthineſſe that I thought to bee in it▪ for it is rudely ſet out, in ſenſible and hamelie tearmes, as it was receued of my mouth, and as it pleaſed GOD for the time to giue me it: But I had this reſpect, that as it is the firſt thing that proceds from me: ſa I thought meet, to make it the firſt teſtimonie of my thankfulnes and ſyncere affection, als weill to the truth of God, as to ȝour M. ſeruice: quhome vnder God,

I tender as mine awn life: and wald be glad, that God wald bliſſe mee with they moyans, that might aduance Ȝour highnes name or eſtimation, baith heer in this preſent warld, and in the warld to come. And in the mean time, becauſe I may not as I wald, I ſall doe as I may, in my praiers continually remember Ȝour royall perſoun, togither with the Queene Ȝour bedfelow: and craue continuaunce of Ȝour race, at the handes of the almighty God, thorow the righteous merits of Ieſus Chriſt: vnder quhais protection, for now and euer, I leaue Ȝour Maieſtie.

               THE FIRST SERMON, VPON THE SACRAMENTS IN GENErall: Preached the firſt of February. 1589.
               
                  
                     1. COR. 11. 23.
For I haue receiued of the Lord, that which I alſo haue deliuered vnto ȝou, to wit, that the Lorde Ieſus, in the night that hee was betrayed, tooke bread, &c.
               
               
                  THAIR is nathing in this warld, nor out of this warld, mair to be wiſhed of euerye ane of ȝou, mair to be craued & ſought of euerie ane of ȝou; nor to be cō
                  joyned with Chriſt Ieſus, nor anis to be maid ane with the God of glory, Chriſt Ieſus. This heauenly & celeſtiall coniunction is purchaſed & brought about, be

twa ſpeciall meanes: It is brought about be the mean of the word, & preaching of the goſpell: & it is brought about be the meane of the Sacraments and miniſtration thairof. The word leads vs to chriſt be the ear: the ſacraments leads vs to Chriſt be the eie; Twa ſenſes of al the reſt, quhilk God hes choſen, as maiſt meete for this purpoſe to inſtruct vs, and bring vs to Chriſt. For that doctrine mann be maiſt effectuall and mouing, that walkens and ſteirs vp monieſt of the outward ſenſes: that doctrine that walkens not onely the eare, bot the eye, the taiſt, the feeling, and all the reſt of the outwarde ſenſes, mann moue the hart maiſt, mann be maiſt effectuall and pearcing in the ſaul: Bot ſa it is, that this doctrine of the Sacraments mouis, ſteirs vp, & walkins monieſt of the outward ſenſes; Therefore it mann be (gif we cum weil prepared to it) maiſt effectual to ſteir vp the inward ſenſes of the dull hart. But thair is a thing, that ȝee mann euer remember; Thair is na doctrine, nather of the ſimple word, nor ȝit of the ſacraments, gif Chriſt abſtract his haly Spirit, that is able to moue. Therfore, quhen euer ȝe come to hear the doctrine, quhider

it be of the Sacraments, or of the ſimple word: craue of God, that hee wald be preſent be his haly Spirit, or vtherwais al the doctrine in the earth will not availe ȝou. Alwaies, this doctrine of the Sacraments, ſteires vp, and walkens monieſt of the outward ſenſes, and therefore there is na queſtioun, but it is ane effectual and potent inſtrumēt to walken, prepare and ſteir vp our harts.
               Then to lat ȝou ſee, quhat the worde Sacrament meanis: and to remooue theThe diuers taking of the word Sacrament. ambiguitie of it; It is certaine, and out of all queſtioun, that the Latine Theologs, quha were maiſt auncient, did interprete the Greeke worde 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  , be the word Sacrament, & thay vſed the greeke word, not only to ſignifie the hail action, as the hail action of Baptiſme, & the hail action of the Supper of the Lord: but thay vſed the word myſtery, to ſignifie quhatſoeuer is darke, & hid in it ſelf, & not frequented in the commoun vſe of men: as efter this maner, the Apoſtle Epheſ. 39 callis the vocation of the Gentils a myſtery. Epheſ. 5. 32 This coniunction quhilk is begun heir betwixt vs & Chriſt, is called a Myſterie, and the Latine interpreters, callis it a Sacrament, and to bee

ſchort, ȝee will not finde in the booke of God, a word mair frequent, nor the word Myſterie. But as to the word Sacrament, quhairby they ſignifie the Greeke word, we find not this word be the ſame Theologs to bee tane ſa largelie: nather is it tane ſa largely in ony pairt of the booke of God. Alwayis, the word Sacrament, is very ambiguous in it ſelf, and there raiſe about the ambiguitie of this word, many tragedeis, quhilke are not ȝit ceaſed, nor wil not ceaſe, quhil the warld laſts: quher vtherwais, gif they had keeped the Apoſtles words, and called thame as the Apoſtle callis tham, ſignes and ſeales: all this digladiatioun, ſtrife and contention, appearandly had not fallen out. But quhere men will be wiſer nor God, & giue namis to thinges beſide God, vpon the wit of man, quhilk is but meere folly: all this cummer fallis out. Weill than, to come to the purpoſe. The auncient Theologs, tooke the worde Sacrament, as wee may perceaue, in a fourfauld maner. Somtime they tooke it for the hail actioun, that is, for the haill miniſterie of the Elements. Somtime, they tooke it not for the haill actioun: but for the outward things, that

are vſed in the action of Baptiſme, and of the Supper, as they took it, for the water and ſprinckling of it: for the Bread and Wine, breaking, diſtributing, and eating therof. Thirdly againe: they tooke it not for the hail outward things, that are vſed in the actioun; but onely for the material and earthly thinges, the Elements: as for Bread and Wine in the Supper, and water in Baptiſme. And efter this ſort, ſayis AVGVSTINE: The wicked eats the body of our Lord, concerning the Sacrament onlie, that is, concerning the Elements onely. Laſt of all: they tooke it not onely for the Elements, but for the things ſignified be the elements. And efter this maner, IRENEE ſayis, that a Sacramēt ſtāds of twa things, the ane earthly, the vther heauenly. The auncients then, taking the worde efter thir ſorts, na queſtion, all thir wayis they tooke it rightly.
               But leuing the ambiguitie of the word, I take the worde Sacrament, as it is tane and vſed this day in the Kirk of God, for a haly ſigne and ſeale, that is annexed to the preached word of God, to ſeale vp and confirme the truth, contained in the ſame word, in ſick ſort, that I call not onlie

the ſeale ſeparated fra the word, a Sacrament: For as there cannot be a ſeale, but that quhilk is the ſeal of ane euident, & gif the ſeal be ſeparated fra the euidēt, it is not a ſeal; Bot looke quhat it is be nature, it is na mair: ſa ther can not be a Sacramēt, except it be hung to the euident of the word; Bot look what the Sacramēt was be nature, it is na mair. Was it a com mō peece bread, it remains cōmon bread except it bee hung to the euident of the word. Therfore the word only cannot be a Sacrament; nor the elemēt only cannot be a Sacrament; bot word & element con iunctly man make a Sacrament: & ſa AVGYSTINE ſaid weill, lat the word come to the element, & ſa ȝe ſal haue a ſacrament: in ſick ſort, that the word mann come to the element, that is the worde preached diſtinctly, and al the parts of it opned vp, man ga before the hinging to of the ſacrament, and the Sacrament, as a ſeale mann follow and be appended therefter. Then I call a Sacrament, the word and ſeal coniunctlie, the ane hung to the vther.
               It is without all controuerſie, and there is na debait in it, that all Sacraments are ſignes. Now gif a Sacrament be aſign, as

the ſign is in a relation, in that Category; for ſawe man ſpeake it: Sa the ſacrament man be placed in that ſame Categorie of relation. Now euery relation again man ſtand of force betwixt twa things, for an thing cannot be the correlatiue of it ſelf: but in a lawfull relatioun, of force there man be twa things, quhilk twa, hes euer a mutual reſpect, the ane to the vther. Therfore in every ſacramēt that hes a relation, thair man be twa things, quhilk twa hes euer a mutual reſpect the an to the vther. Take me away ane of thir twa things fra the Sacrament; ȝe tine the relation, & tyning the relation, ȝe tyne the Sacrament. Confound me ane of thir twa, with the vther: make ather a confuſion or permixion of tham, ȝe tine the relation, & tyning the relation, ȝe tine the ſacrament. Turne me over the an into the vther, ſa that the ſubſtance of the ane, ſtarts vp and euaniſhis in the vther: ȝe tyne the relation, and ſa ȝe tyne the Sacrament. Than as in euery ſacrament, ther is a relation, ſa to kepe the relation, ȝe man euer kepe twa things ſeuerally in the Sacrament.
               Now for the better conſideration and vnderſtanding of thir twa diuers thinges

quhilk are relatiue to vthers, we ſal kepeThe heads to be entreted in this Sermon. this ordour by Godis grace: Firſt, we ſal lat ȝou ſee, quhat is meaned be a ſigne in the Sacrament. Nixt we ſal let ȝou vnderſtand1 quhat is meaned be the thinge ſignified.2 Thirdlie, howe thir twa are coupled,3 be quhat power and vertue they are4 conjoyned, and quherfra this power and vertue dois flowe. Fourtlie, and laſt of al; we ſall let ȝou vnderſtand, quhither ane and the ſelfe ſame inſtrument, geuis the ſigne and the thing ſignified or not, quhither they be geuin in ane actioun or twa, quhither they bee offered to ane inſtrument or twa, or gif they be giuen efter a maner or twa to baith the inſtruments. Mark thir diuerſities, the diuerſe maner of receauing, the diuerſitie of the inſtruments, and the diuerſitie of the geuaris: and ȝee ſall finde litle difficultie in the ſacrament.
               Now to begin at the ſignes: Seeing all1 ſacraments ar ſignes, quhat call wee theThe ſignes in the Sacrament. ſignes in the ſacrament? I call the ſignes in the Sacrament, quhatſoeuer I perceaue and takis vp be my outwarde ſenſes, be myne eie eſpecially. Nowe ȝee ſee in this Sacrament, there is twa ſortes of thing is

ſubject to the outward ſenſes, and to the eie eſpecially; ȝe ſee the elemēts of bread and wine are ſubject to myne eie: Therefore they man be ſigns. Ȝe ſee again, that the rites and ceremonies quhereby thir elements are diſtributed, broken and giuen, are ſubject to myne eie alſo. Then I mann mak twa ſortes of ſignes, ane ſorte of the breade and the wine, and wee call thame elementall: ane vther ſorte of the rites and ceremonies, quhereby thir are diſtributed, broken and giuen, and we cal thame ceremonial. Be not deceaued with the word ceremonie, think not, ſuppoſe I call the breaking of the breade, the eating of the breade, and drinking of the wine ceremonies, think not that they are vayn, as ȝee vſe that word ceremonie for a vayne thing, quhilk hes na grace, nor profit following efter it: na, ſuppoſe I cal thame ceremonies, there is neuer a ceremonie quhilk Chriſt inſtituted in this ſupper, but it is als eſſential as the bread and the wine are, and ȝee cannot leaue a jote of thame, except ȝe peruert the hail inſtitutioun. For quhat euer Chriſt commanded to be done, quhat euer he ſpake or did in that hail actioun, it is eſſentiall

and mann be done, and ȝe cannot leaue a jote thereof, but ȝee will peruert the hail actioun.
               The reaſoun, quherefore I call thameQuhy they are called ſignes. ſignes, is this: I call thame not ſignes, be that reaſon that men commonlie call is thame ſignes: becauſe they ſignifie only, as the bread ſignifies the body of Chriſt, & the wine ſignifies the blood of Chriſt. I call thame not ſignes, becauſe they repreſent only, but I call thame ſignes becauſe they haue the body and blood of Chriſt conjoyned with thame, ȝee ſa trulie is the body of Chriſt conjoyned with that breade, and the blood of Chriſt conjoyned with that wine, that als ſoone as thou receauis that bread in thy mouth, (gif thou bee a faithfull man or woman) als ſone thou receueſt the body of Chriſt in thy ſaull, and that be fayth. And als ſoone as thou receauis that wine in thy mouth, als ſone thou receauis the blood of Chriſt in thy ſaul, and that be faith. In reſpect of this exhibitioun cheiflie, that they are inſtruments to deliuer, and exhibite the thing that they ſignifie, and not in reſpect onely of there repreſentatioun, they are called ſignes. For gif they

did nathing bot repreſented or ſignified a thing abſent; Then ony picture or dead Image, ſuld be a Sacrament: For there is na Picture, as the Picture of the King, but at the ſight of the Picture, the King will come in ȝour minde, and it will ſignifie to ȝou, that that is the Kings Picture. Sa, gif the ſigne of the Sacrament did na further; all Pictures ſuld be Sacraments; but in reſpect the Sacrament exhibites and deliuers the thing that it ſignifies to the ſaul and hart, ſa ſone as the ſigne is deliuered to the mouth: for this cauſe eſpeciallie, it is called a ſigne. There is na Picture of the King, that will deliuer the King vnto ȝou: there is na vther Image that will exhibite the thing quhair of it is the Image: therefore, there is na Image can be a Sacrament. Then in reſpect, the Lorde hes appointed the Sacraments, as hands to deliuer and exhibite the thing ſignified: for this deliuery and exhibitioun chieflie, they are called ſignes. As the woorde of the Euangell is a mighty and potent inſtrument to our euerlaſting ſaluatioun: ſa the Sacrament, is a potent inſtrument appointed bee God, to deliuer to vs Chriſt Ieſus, to our euerlaſting

ſaluatioun. For this ſpirituall meate is dreſſed, and geuen vppe to vs in ſpirituall diſches, that is, in the Miniſtery of the word, and in the miniſtery of the Sacraments. And ſuppoſe this Miniſtery be externall, ȝit the Lord is ſaid, to deliuer ſpiritual and heauenly things, be thir externall thinges: Quhy? Becauſe he hes appointed thame as inſtruments, quhairby, he wil deliuer his awin Sone to vs. For this is certaine, that nane hes power to deliuer Chriſt Ieſus to vs, except God and his halie Spirit: and therefore, to ſpeake properly, there is nane can deliuer Chriſt bot God be his awin Spirit: he is deliuered be the Miniſtery of the halie Spirit: it is the halie Spirit that ſeals him vp in our harts, and confirmis vs mair and mair in him: as the Apoſtle geuis him this ſtile 2. COR. 1. 22. To ſpeake properly: there is nane hes power to deliuer Chriſt, bot God the father, or himſelfe: there is nane hes power to deliuer the Mediatour, bot his awin Spirit: Ȝit it hes pleaſed God to vſe ſum inſtruments and meanis, quhairby hee will deliuer Chriſt Ieſus to vs: the means are thir: the miniſtery of the word and the miniſtery of the Sacraments: and

in reſpect hee vſes thir as meanis to deliuer Chriſt, they are ſaid to deliuer him. But heir ȝee haue to diſtinguiſh, betwixt the principall efficient deliuerer, and the inſtrumentall efficient, quhilk is the word and the Sacraments: Keeping this diſtinction, baith thir are true, God be his worde, and God bee his Spirit, deliuers Chriſt Ieſus to ȝou. Then I ſay, I cal tham ſignes, becauſe God hes maid thame potent inſtrumentis to deliuer that ſame thing quhilk they ſignifie.
               Nowe I ga to the thing ſignified, and I call the thing ſignified bee the ſignes in the Sacrament, that quhilk IRENEE, that auld writer, call is the heauenly and ſpirituall thing, to wit: haill Chriſt, with his hail giftes, benefites and graces, applied and geuen to my ſaul. Then I call not the2 thing ſignified be the ſigns of bread andQuhat is the thing ſignified in the Sacrament. wine: the benefits of Chriſt, the graces of Chriſt, or the vertue that flowis out of Chriſt onlie; But I cal the thing ſignified, togidder with the benefites and vertues flowing fra him, the verie ſubſtaunce of Chriſt himſelf; quherefra this vertue dois flow: The ſubſtāce, with the vertues, gifts and graces, that flowes fra the ſubſtance,

ar the thing ſignified heere. For as to the vertue & graces, that flows fra Chriſt: It is not posſible, that thou can be partaker of the vertue, that flowes fra his ſubſtaunce, except thou be firſt partaker of the ſubſtance it ſelfe: For how is it posſible, that I can be partaker of the iuyce that flowes out of ony ſubſtance, except I bee partaker of the ſubſtance it ſelfe firſt. Is it poſſible that my ſtomach can bee refreſhed with that meat, the ſubſtaunce quhairof, come neuer in my mouth? Is it posſible, that my drouth can be ſlokned with that drinke, that paſſed neuer ouer my halſe? Is it posſible, that I can ſowck ony vertue out of onye thing, except I get the ſubſtance firſt: Sa it is imposſible, that I can get the iuice and vertue, that flows out of Chriſt, except I get the ſubſtance, that is, himſelfe firſt. Sa I call not the thing ſignified, the grace and vertue that flowes fra Chriſt onelie, nor Chriſt himſelfe and his ſubſtance, without his vertue and graces onelie: But ioyntly the ſubſtance with the graces, haill Chriſt, GOD and man, without ſeparatioun of his natures, without diſcretioun of his ſubſtaunce fra his graces, I call the thing ſignified, bee the

ſignes in the Sacrament. For quhy? Gif na mair bee ſignified bee the bread, bot the fleſch and bodie of Chriſt onelie, and na mair be ſignified be the wine, but the blood of Chriſt onelie, thou can not ſay, that the bodie of Chriſt is Chriſt, it is but a cowpon of Chriſt: thou cannot ſay that the blud of Chriſt, is hail Chriſt, it is bot a part of him, & a cowpō of thy Sauiour, ſaued thee not, a part of thy ſauior wroght not the wark of thy ſaluation: and ſa ſuppoſe thou get a cowpon of him in the ſacrament, that cowpoun wald do thee na good. To the end therfore, that this ſacrament may nuriſh thee to life euerlaſting; thou man get in it thy haill Sauiour, haill Chriſt God & man, with his haill graces & benefits, without ſeperation of his ſubſtance fra his graces, or of the ane nature fra the vther. And how get I him? Not be my mouth. It is a vaine thing to thinke, that we will get God be our mouth: but we get him be faith: As hee is a Spirit, ſa I eat him bee faith & beleif in my ſaul: Not be the teeth of my mouth, that is a vaine thing. I giue the, that thou might eat the fleſh of Chriſt with thy teeth, & this were a cruel maner of doing: ȝit thou may not

eat the God head with thy teeth: this is a groſſe faſchioun of ſpeaking. Sa, gif euer ȝe get good of the Sacrament, ȝee mann get haill Chriſt, and there is not ane inſtrument to gripp him, bot be faith onelie: therefore come with a faithfull hart.
               O! but ȝe will ſpeere at me, and appearandlie the definitioun layd doun of the thing ſignified, giues a ground to it; gif the fleſch of Chriſt, & the blood of Chriſt be a pairt of the thing ſignified: how can I call his fleſche a ſpirituall and heauenlyQueſtion. thing, and Chriſt in reſpect of his fleſche a heauenly thing? Ȝe will not ſay that the ſubſtance of Chriſts fleſch is ſpirituall: or that the ſubſtance of his blood is ſpirituall, quherefore then cal ȝe it ane heauenly and ſpirituall thing? I will tell ȝou: the, fleſch of Chriſt is called a ſpiritual thing, and Chriſt is called ſpiritual, in reſpect of his fleſh, not that his fleſhe is becomd a ſpirit, or that the ſubſtance of his fleſh is becomd ſpirituall: Na, it remaned true fleſhe and the ſubſtance of it is ane; as it was in the wombe of the virgin, his fleſhe is not called ſpirituall nather, in reſpect it is glorified in the heauens at the right hand of the father: be not deceaued with

that, for ſuppoſe it be glorified; ȝit it remains true fleſh, that ſame fleſh quhilk he tooke out of the wombe of the Virgin. It is not ſpiritual nather, becauſe thou ſeeis it not in the Supper, gif thou war quhere it is, thou might ſee it: but it is called ſpirituall, in reſpect of the ſpirituall ende, quherunto it ſeruis to my body and ſaul:Anſwer. becauſe the fleſch and bloode of Chriſt, ſeruis to nuriſh mee; not to a temporall life: but to a ſpirituall and heauenly life. Nowe, in reſpect this fleſh is a ſpirituall food, ſeruing me to a ſpirituall life; For this caus it is called a ſpiritual thing. Gif it nuriſhed me, as the fleſh of beaſts dois, but to a temporall life, it ſuld bee called but a temporall thing: But in reſpect, it nuriſhes my ſaull, not to ane earthlie and temporall life, but to ane heauenly, celeſtiall, and ſpirituall end: In reſpect of this end, the fleſh of Chriſt, and Chriſt in reſpect of his fleſhe, is called the ſpirituall thing in the Sacrament. It is called alſo, the ſpirituall thing in the Sacrament, in reſpect of the ſpirituall inſtrumēt, quherby it is receiued. The inſtrument quhereby the fleſh of Chriſt is receaued, is not a corporal inſtrument, is not the teeth and

mouth of the body; but it is ſpirituall, it is the mouth of the ſaull, quhilk is faith: and in reſpect the inſtrument is ſpirituall: Therefore Chriſt, quha is receaued, is alſo called ſpirituall. In reſpect alſo, that the maner of receauing, is a heauenlie, ſpirituall and celeſtiall maner, not a naturall, nor externall maner, in reſpect that the fleſh of Chriſt, quhilk is giuen in the Sacrament, is receiued be a ſpirituall and ſecreet maner, quhilk is not ſeene to the eies of men. In all thir reſpects, I call Chriſt Ieſus the heauenlye and ſpirituall thing, quhilk is ſignified be the ſignes in the Sacrament.
               Now: I ſay in the end, the thing ſignified

Quhat auails it me, to ſee my ſaluatioun afar off, gif it be not applied to me? Therfore it is not aneugh to vs to ſee Chriſt: bot he mann be giuen vs; or els hee cannot work health and ſaluation in vs. And as this ſaluatioun is giuen vs; wee mann haue a mouth to take it. Quhat auails it me to ſee meat before me; except I haue

a mouth to take it? Sa, the thing ſignified in the Sacrament, mann bee giuen vs be God, be the three perſons of the Trinity, a God, be Chriſt leſus, quha mann giue himſelfe, and as he giues himſelfe; ſa wee man haue a mouth to take him. Suppoſe hee preſents and offers him ſelfe: ȝit hee can profite or auaile nane, but thame, quha hes a mouth to receaue him. Then ȝee ſee, quhat I call the thing ſignified: haill Chriſt applied to vs, and receaued be vs: hail Chriſt God and man, without ſeparatioun of his natures, without diſcretioun of his ſubſtance fra his graces, all applied to vs. Then I ſay, ſeeing wee come to the Sacrament, to bee fed bee his fleſh, and refreſhed bee his blood, to be fed to ane heauenly and ſpiritual life: and ſeeing there is na profite to bee had of this Table, without ſome kynd of preparatioun: Therefore lat na man preaſe to ga to that halie Table, except in ſome meaſure hee be prepared. Some will bee prepared in a greater meaſure thē vthers. Alwayis, lat na man preſume to ga to it, except in ſome meaſure his hart bee ſanctified. Therfore my exhortation concerning the way, quhairby euery ane of ȝou

ought to prepare ȝour ſelfis, that ȝe may dreſſe ȝou the better to the table, is this: There is neuer ane of ȝou, that comes to the Table of the Lorde, to caſt before the Lord, ȝour integritie, iuſtice and vprightnes: But quhaſoeuer gais to the Table, he ought to ga with the acknowledging and confesſioun of his miſerie: hee ought to ga with a ſorrowfull hart, for the ſinnes quhairin he hes offended God: he ought to ga with a haitrent of thay ſins; not to proteſt, that he is halie, iuſt, and vpright: But to proteſt and confeſſe▪ that he is miſerable, and of all creatures, the maiſt miſerable. And therefore, he gais to that table, to get ſupport for his miſerie, to get a gripp of mercie at the throne of grace: and to get remisſioun and forgiuenes of his ſinnes; to get the gift of repentance, that mair and mair, he may ſtudie to liue vprightlie, halilie and ſoberlie in all time comming. Therefore, except ȝee haue entred in this courſe, and are of purpoſe to continue in this courſe, to amend your life bigane, to repent ȝou of ȝour ſinnes, and be the grace of God, to liue mair vprightlie and ſoberlie, nor ȝee haue done, for Gods cauſe ga not to the Table. For

quhere there is not a purpoſe to do weil and to repent, of necesſitie, there mann be a purpoſe to doe ill: and quhaſoeuer coms to that Table, with a purpoſe to do ill, and without a purpoſe to repent: hee comes to mocke Chriſt; to skorne him in his face, & to eat his awin preſent condē
                  natiō. Sa, lat na man come to that table, that hes not in his hart a purpoſe to doe better: that hes not a hart to ſorrow for his ſinnes bigane: and thinks not his bigane folie and madnes ouer meekle. Lat na man come to that table without this, vnder the paine of damnatioun. But gif ȝe haue in ȝour hart, a purpoſe to do better, ſuppoſe ȝour bigan life hes bene diſſolute and looſe: ȝit gif ȝe be tuitched in ȝour hart, with ony feeling or remorſe of ȝour bigane life, ga not fra the table, but come with a proteſtatioun of thy miſerie and wretchednes, and come with a hart to get grace. Gif with a diſſolute life, I meane not of open ſlaunders, thou haue alſo a purpoſe not to amend, but to doe war, for Gods ſake abſteine. This far for the thing ſignified.
               Into this generall conſideration, there reſts thir thinges ȝit to bee maid plaine

vnto ȝou. Firſte, howe the ſignes and the thing ſignified are coupled togidder, and how they are conioyned. Nixt, it reſts to be tauld ȝou; how the ſigne is deliuered, and how the thing ſignified is deliuered, and how baith are receaued, als weill as they are deliuered. This being done, I fall ſpeake ſhortly of the vther part of the Sacrament, quhilk is the worde: And laſt of all, wee ſall lat ȝou ſee, quhat ſort of faultes they are, that peruerts the Sacrament, and makes it of na effect. And gif time ſall ſerue, we ſall enter in particular, to this ſacramēt, quhilk we haue in hand.
               Then to come backe againe. In the third roume, it coms in to be conſidered;Howe the ſigne and the thinge ſignified are jovned togidder. how the ſigne and the thing ſignified are coupled: For about this conjunction, all the debait ſtandes: all the ſtrife that wee haue with thame, that varies fra the ſtreight trueth, ſtandes about the maner of this coniunction. Some wil haue tham conioyned efter ane way, and ſome efter ane vther way; and men ſtriues verie bitterlie about this mater, and continues ſa in ſtrife, that thorow the bitternes of contention, they tyne the trueth. For quhen the heat of contentioun riſes, and ſpecially

in diſputation, they take not tent to the trueth, but to the victorie: Gif they may bee victorious, and it were but be a multitude of words, they regard not ſuppoſe they tyne the trueth. Reade their works, and books about this coniunctioun, and ȝee ſall craue, rather conſcience nor knawledge: ȝea, gif they had the quarter of the conſcience, that they haue of knawledge: na queſtioun, this controuerſie might bee eaſilie tane vp; but men laking conſcience, & hauing knawledge, an euil conſcience peruerts the knawlege and drawes thame to ane euil end. To tel ȝou now, how thir twa are conioyned: it will be farre eaſier for me, and better for ȝou to vnderſtand, to tell ȝou firſt, howe they are not conioyned: for I ſall make it very cleare vnto ȝou, be letting ȝou ſee how they are not conioyned: but it is not posſible, to make it ſo cleare, by telling ȝou the maner how they are conioyned. Ȝee may perceaue clearelie be ȝour awin eies, that the ſigne & the thing ſignified are not locally conioyned, that is, they are not baith in ane place. Ȝee may perceaue alſo be ȝour outwarde ſenſes, that the body of Chriſt, quhilk is the thing ſignified,

and the ſignes are not conioyned corporallie: their bodies tuitches not vthers. Ȝee may perceaue alſo, they are not viſiblie conioyned, they ar not baith ſubject to the outwarde eye. Sa it is eaſie to lat ȝou ſee, howe they are not conioyned. For gif the ſigne and the thing ſignified were viſiblie & corporally conioyned, Quhat miſterd vs to haue a ſign? Quherefore ſuld the ſigne in the Sacrament ſerue vs? Is not the ſigne in the Sacrament appointed to lead me to Chriſt? Is not the ſigne appointed, to point out Chriſt to me? Gif I ſawe him preſent be mine awin eye, as I doe the bread, quhat miſter had I of the bread? Therefore ȝee may ſee clearlie, that there is na ſik thing as a corporall, naturall, or ony ſiclike phyſicall coniunction, betwixt the ſigne, and the thing ſignified. Sa I ſay, it is eaſie to let ȝou ſee, howe they are not conioyned. Then come on, how are they conioyned? We cannot craue here any vther ſort of coniunctioun, nor may ſtand and agree with the nature of the Sacrament: For na thing can be conioyned with ane vther efter ane vther ſort, nor the nature of it will ſuffer. Therefore there cannot

be heir ane vther ſort of coniunction, nor the nature of the Sacrament will ſuffer. Now the nature of the ſacrament, wil ſuffer ane ſacramentall coniunction. O but that is als hard ȝit: Ȝe are neuer the better of this: but I ſall make it cleare bee Gods grace. Ȝee knaw, euery Sacrament is a myſterie; there is not a Sacrament, but it conteinis a high and diuine myſterie. In reſpect then, that a Sacrament is a myſterie, it followes that a myſticall, ſecrete and ſpirituall coniunctioun, agreis weill with the nature of the Sacrament. As the coniunctioun betwixt vs & Chriſt is full of a myſterie, as the Apoſtle lets ȝou ſee, EPHES. 5. 32. as it is a myſticall and ſpiritual coniunction; Sa na dout, the coniunction betwixt the Sacrament, and the thing ſignified in the Sacrament, man be of that ſame nature, myſticall and ſpirituall. It is not posſible to tell ȝou be na ocular demonſtratioun, how Chriſt and we are conioyned. But quha euer wald vnderſtand that coniunctioun, his minde mann be enlightned with ane heauenlie eie, that as he hes ane eye in his head to ſee corporall things: Sa he mann haue in his minde and hart, ane heauenlie eye, to

ſee this myſticall coniunction. A heauenlie eye to take vp this ſecret coniunction, that is betwixt the Sonne of God and vs, in the Sacrament. Sa I miſter not to inſiſt; Except ȝee haue this heauenlie illumination, ȝee can neuer vnderſtand, nather ȝour awin coniunction with Chriſt, nor ȝit the coniunction betwixt the ſigne and the thing ſignified in the Sacrament. But I keepe my ground: As the Sacrament is a myſterie: Sa the coniunctioun that is into the Sacrament, na dout, man be a myſtical, ſecret and ſpiritual coniunction. Beſide this, I lut ȝou ſee, be the generall deduction, that in euery Sacrament there is twa things: quhilk twa, hes a relatioun, and a mutuall reſpect the ane to the vther. Sa that a relatiue coniunction, agrees weill with the nature of the ſacramēt. Then ſpeirs thou quhat kind of coniunction it is? I giue thee the coniunction that agrees with their nature, to wit, a relatiue and a reſpectiue coniunction, ſik a coniunction, quhairin the ſign hes a continuall reſpect to the thing ſignified, and the thing ſignified to the ſigne. Then crauis thou in a worde, the ſort of coniunction, that is betwixt the ſigne & the

thing ſignified? I call it a ſecret and a myſticallThis conjunctioun is maid cleir, be the conjunction betwixt the word, and the thinge ſignified thereby. coniunctioun, that ſtands in a mutuall relatioun, betwixt the ſigne and the thing ſignified. There is ane vther coniunction, beſide the coniunctioun that is betwixt Chriſt and vs, that may mak this coniunctioun betwixt the ſigne and the thing ſignified in the Sacrament mair cleare: and this is the coniunction quhilk is betwixt the word that ȝe hear, and the thing ſignified be the ſame word. Looke quhat ſort of coniunction is betwixt the word quhilk ȝee heare, and the thing ſignified that comes in ȝour mind: the like coniunctiō is betwixt the ſign that ȝe ſee, and the thing ſignified in the Sacrament. Ȝee may perceaue eaſilie: there is a coniunction be the effect, ſuppoſe ȝee cannot knaw the ſort of coniunction. For quhy? Ȝee heare not the word ſa ſone ſpoken be me, but incontinent, the thing, quhilk my worde quhairof I ſpeake ſignifies, comes in your mind: ſpeake I of things bigane, of things to come, or of thinges that are neuer ſa far abſent: I cannot ſa ſone ſpeak to ȝou of thame in this language, but the thing ſignified comes in ȝour minde; Na doubt, becauſe there is a coniunction

betwixt the worde & the thing ſignified▪ Sa, euery ane of ȝou may eaſily perceaue, that there is a coniunctioun betwixt the word, & the thing ſignified be the word. As for example, ſuppoſe Paris bee far diſtant fra vs; Ȝit ſpeake I of Paris, the word is not ſa ſone ſpoken, but the toune will come in ȝour mind: Speak I of the King, ſuppoſe he be far diſtant fra vs, the word is not ſa ſoone ſpoken, but the thing ſignified will come in ȝour minde. Sa this comming of the thing ſignified in the hart and mind, lats ȝou ſee clearlie, that there is a coniunction betwixt the word, and the thing ſignified bee the word. To tell ȝou of this ſort of coniunctioun, it is not ſa eaſie: Becauſe the thing ſignified is not preſent to the eye, as the worde is to the eare. Gif euery thing ſignified, war als preſent to ȝour eye, as the word is to ȝour eare; it were eaſie to ſee the coniunction. But ſeeing the coniunction is myſticall, ſecrete and ſpirituall: therefore it is hard to make ȝou to vnderſtand it. Always looke quhat coniunction is betwixt the ſimple word, & the thing ſignified be the word: that ſame ſort of cōiunction is betwixt the ſacrament and the thing ſignified

bee the Sacrament. For the Sacrament is na vther thing, but ane viſible word. I call it a viſible word, quhy? Becauſe it conuoyes the ſignificatioun of it, be the eie to the minde. As this is ane audible worde, becauſe it conuoyes the ſignification of it be the ear to the mind, in the ſame ſacrament, ſa oft as ȝee looke on it, ȝee ſall not ſa ſoone ſee that bread with ȝour eie, but the bodie of Chriſt ſall come in ȝour mind: Ȝee ſall not ſa ſoone ſee that wine, but efter the preaching & opning vp of the parts of the Sacrament, the bloode of Chriſt ſall come in ȝour mind. Now this coniunction betwixt the ſigne and the thing ſignified in the Sacrament; ſtands chiefly, as ȝe may perceaue, in twa points: Firſt in an relation betwixt the ſign & the thing ſignified, quhilkriſes of an likenes & proportion, betwixt thir twa: for gif there were na proportion & analogie, betwixt the ſigne and thing ſignified be the ſigne; there could not bee a Sacrament or ane relatioun. Sa the firſt pairt of this coniunction ſtands in a relation, quhilk riſes vpon ane certaine ſimilitude & likenes, quhilk the ane hes with the vther. And this likelines may be eaſilie

perceaued. For looke howe able the bread is to nuriſhe thy body to this life earthlie and temporal, the fleſh of Chriſt, ſignified be the bred, is als able to nuriſh baith body and ſaull to life everlaſting. Sa ȝee may perceaue ſome kinde of proportion betwixt the ſigne and the thing ſignified. The ſecound point of the coniunction, ſtands in a continuall and mutual concurring of the an with the vther, in ſik ſort, that the ſigne, & the thing ſignified, ar offered baith togither, receaued togither, at ane time and in ane actioun: the ane outwardelie, the vther inwardly, gif ſa be that thou haue a mouth in thy ſaull, quhilk is faith, to receaue it. Then the ſecound point of the conjunctioun ſtands in a joynt offering, and in a joynt receauing, & this I call ane concurrence. Then ſpeere ȝee, quhat ſort of conjunction is betwixt the ſigne and the thing ſignified? I ſay, it is a relatiue conjunction, a ſecret and a myſtical conjunction, quhilk ſtands in a mutuall relatioun.
               There is na farther to be obſerued heir, except only this: that ſuppoſe ȝe conjoin thir twa, be war that ȝe confound thame not, bee war that ȝee turne not over the

ane in the other: but keepe every ane of thame in their awin integritie, without confuſion or permixtion of the ane with the other, and ſa ȝee ſall haue the lawfull conjunctioun that ſulde bee in the ſacrament. There is not a leſſoun that can be learned of this, at leaſt that I can marke or gather, except onely the leſſoun of the kindenes and goodnes of the everliuing God; quha hes invented ſa mony wonderfull ſortes of conjunctioun, and all to this purpoſe, that wee might be conjoyned, to aduance this great and myſticall conjunctioun, betwixt the God of glorie and vs: In the quhilk conjunctioun, our weil, felicity and happines in this life, and in the life to come, dois only ſtand: That he is ſa cairfull to conjoine himſelfe with his worde and Sacraments, that wee, in his word and Sacraments might be conjoyned with him. Gif wee were moued with the care and loue of God, vttered in thir conjunctiones, and it were neuer ſa litle on our pairts: aſſuredly we wald not defraud our ſelfs, of the fruit of that happy conjunction, nor bring it in ſik a loath and diſdaine as wee do this day: for wee be folowing and preferring of our pleaſures

to Chriſt and his counſell, hes made the ſtomachis of our ſaules ſa foule and ill diſpoſed, that ather they receiue him not at all, or gif he be receaued, he is not able to tary: And quhy? becauſe ane foul ſtomach is not able to keepe him, for incontinent we chok him ſa, ather with the luſtis of the fleſh, or with rhe cares of this warlde, that hee is compelled to depart: & gif Chriſt be not baith, deuoured and digeſted, hee can doe vs na good: And this digeſtion can not be quhere there is not a gredy appetite to the receit of him; for gif thou be not hungry for him, he is not ready for thee. And I am aſſured gif all the men in this countrie were examined efter this rule, that there were nane that receuis Chriſt, bot he that hes a ſtomach and is hungrie for him, it fearis me that few ſuld bee found to receaue him. It fears me, that we haue tane ſik a loath and diſdaine of that heauenlie food, that there is not ſick a thing, as ony kinde of hunger, or appetite of it in our ſaules. And quhat is the cauſe of this? I will tell ȝou: Suppoſe wee haue renounced the corporall and groſſe Idolatrie, wherein our fathers were drowned and plunged

of before, and quhilk men in ſome parts gais about to erect now: Ȝit as the maners of this countrie, and the behauiour of every ane of vs teſtifies, there is neuer a man that hes renoūced that damnable Idol, that he hes in his awin ſaul, nor the inviſible Idolatry, that he hes in his awin hart and mynd. There is neuer a man but to that ſame Idoll quherewith hee wes conceaued and borne, and wherevnto he addicted himſelfe and wes a ſlaue off before, but to that Idoll he geuis his ſeruice ȝit: and therefore meruell not, quhen thou hes addicted thy ſeruice: ſet thy affection, & powred out thy hart vpon that pleaſure of thine awin, vpon that Idoll of thy awin, vpon that luſt & miſchief of thy awin: meruell not, ſuppoſe thou haue na appetite of Chriſt, nor of that heauenlie food. Quhen thou hes thy ſaull powred furth on ſome villany & wickednes, & hes ſend it far a feild: how is it posſible to the, to retire it, or draw it hame againe, to imploy it quhere thou ſuld on Chriſt Ieſus? Then let euery ane in his awin ranck, tak heed to his awin domeſtik Idoll, that ludges within his awin heart, and preaſe to cleare him of it, or vtherwayis, ȝe cannot

ſee the face of Chriſt, nor be pertakers of his kingdome. There is not ane vther leſſoun in chriſtianitie but this: this is the firſt and the laſt leſſoun; to ſhake off ȝour luſtis and affectiouns, peece and peece, and ſa peece and peece renounce thy ſelf, that thou may embrace Chriſt. I grant, there is greater progreſſe in this point, in ſome nor in vthers, ſome leſſe, ſome mair profites in this; But except in ſome meaſure ȝee caſt of ȝour ſelfe, or quhatſoeuer in ȝour awin eies, ȝee compt maiſt precious, to come be Chriſt; ȝee are not worthie of him: And this is verie hard to be done. It is verie eaſie for a man to ſpeake it, to bidd a man renounce his awin Idoll, quhilk I call his affections; but it is not ſa ſone done. Aſſuredly the ſtronger mann come in, to ding out the affection: ȝea the ſtronger nor the deuil, man come in to ding out the deuill, quha makes reſidence in the affection; or els hee will remaine there for euer. Therefore, there are not mony that hes renounced thame ſelfis, and examin thine hart quhen thou will, gif there be ony thing in the warld, that thou louis better nor chriſt, gif thou bee not content, to leaue father and mother,

to leaue wife and children, or quhatſoeuer is deareſt to thee in this warld, for Chriſt, thou art nor worthie of him. Gif thou be not content to caſt off, quhatſoeuer maks thee a ſtranger to Chriſt, thou art not worthie of him. And is this onie little matter, ſeeing there is na part nor power of our ſaul, but it is enemy to this, and repines to this heauenlie coniunction; Is this onie litle mater, to caſt off and renounce our ſelfis, that we may come to Chriſt? Ȝe ſaw neuer a greater matter nor this. It hes not entred into euery hart to conſider of this, for this wark of our new creatioun, is ten thouſand times greater nor the warke of our firſt creation. And therefore it were very neceſſary, that euerie man tooke tent to himſelfe: For the Deuill is ſo craftie in this point, that hee erects euer ane Idoll or vther in our ſaul, and ſometimes vnder the ſhew of vertue, quhilk of all is maiſt dangerous: And in euerie wark that is in our hand, gif it war neuer ſa halie, hee is at our right hande, and maks him to haue intereſt in it. And hee contents himſelfe not with this, vnder the ſhewe of vertues to diſſaue ȝou: But he is ſa walkrife, that euen in the beſt

turne, and quhen ȝe are beſt occupied in ȝour maiſt vertuous actions, hee mixes thame with ſinnes, and ſa dois the thing that lies in him, to make ȝou tine ȝour profit, and looſe ȝour reward. For quhen ȝee are beſt occupied, hee gais about to engender in ȝou an opinion of ȝour ſelfis and ſa defraud God of his glory. Or vtherwayis in doing of good turnes, hee makes ȝou ſa ſlacke and negligent, that gif ȝe do thame, ȝee do thame caldlie, or ſa indiſcreetly, that he maks ȝou begin at the laſt firſt, and makes it that ſuld be firſt laſt; and ſa as MARTHA wes, to be occupied, and ouer bisſie in thay things, quhilk are not ſa neceſſar, as the things quherin MARIE wes occupied. For ſhe ſuld haue preferred firſt the hearing of the worde, to the preparing of Chriſts Supper. This is but to giue ȝou ane inſight, and to lat ȝou ſee, that the deuil is ſa craftie, that ather he caſts in a falſe conceat of our ſelfs in doing ony turne, or els makes vs to do that laſt quhilk ſuld be firſt, or then maks vs altogidder ſa ſluggiſh and ſa negligent that we do the warke of the Lord caldly, and ſa ane way or vther, he halds vs euer in a continuall buſines. Sa that we cannot

be halfe walkrife: For we haue to do with principalities and powers, with ſpirituall wickednes, quhilk are aboue vs, & within vs alſo. For he is not, that hes corruption within him, but Sathan is in him: Sa wee cannot bee halfe walkrife, euer ſtudiing to caſt out the Deuill, to renounce our ſelfis, and to ſubmit vs to the obedience of Chriſt. This farre concerning the coniunction.
               Now, ſeing that the ſigne and the thingHowe the ſigne and the thing ſignified are giuen and receaued. ſignified, are diuers: it reſts to bee conſidered how the ſign is deliuered, and how the thing ſignified is deliuered; and efter quhat manner they are receaued: AndConſiderations thereof. therefore of this conſideration, ȝee haue thir things to wey. Ȝee haue firſt to conſider, quhidder baith the ſigne, and the1 thing ſignified, be deliuered to ȝou be ea man or not. Secondly ȝee haue to conſider,2 quhidder the ſigne and the thing ſignified, be deliuered to ȝou in ane actioun or not. Thirdly, ȝee haue to conſider,3 quhidder baith thir things bee giuen to ane inſtrument or not. And fourtly, ȝee4 haue to conſider, quhidder the ſigne and the thing ſignified, be offered & receaued efter ea maner or not. Now efter that ȝee

haue conſidred all thir, in the ende ȝee ſal find that the ſign & the thing ſignified, ar not giuen be a man; ȝe ſal find nixt, that they are not giuen in a ſort of actioun. Thirdly, ȝe ſal find, that they ar not baith offered and giuen to ane inſtrument. And fourtly, ȝee ſall finde, that they are not baith giuen and receaued efter ane maner. Sa finding this diuerſitie, ȝee haue this to doe: Marke mee the diuerſitie of the propiners and giuers: Marke me the diuerſitie of the actions: Mark me thirdlie, the diuerſitie of the inſtruments, and marke fourtly, the diuers manner of receauing. Mark me all thir diligently, and ȝee ſall finde litle difficultie in the Sacrament. For firſt to mak it cleare vnto ȝou, I ſay, that the ſigne, and the thing ſignified be the ſigne, are not baith giuen be ea man; and this ȝee ſee clearely. For as to the ſigne, that bread, and that wine, ȝe ſee ȝour ſelfe, that the Miniſter offers vnto ȝou the ſigne, hee giues ȝou that Sacrament: as that ſign is ane earthly and corporall thing, ſa it is ane earthly and corporall man that giues it. Now the thing ſignified is of ane vther nature: For it is ane heauenly and ſpirituall thing; therefore

this heauenly thing, is not giuen be an earthly man, this vncorruptible thing, is not giuen be ane naturall and corruptible man; But Chriſt Ieſus hes locked vp and reſerued the Miniſterie of this heauenly thing to himſelfe onely. Therefore there is twa giuers in this ſacrament: The Miniſter giues the earthly thing, Chriſt Ieſus the Mediatour, giues ȝou the heauenlie thing in the Sacrament: For Chriſt in giuing the earthly thing, will not vſe his awin Miniſterie immediatlie, nor the Miniſterie of ane Angell: but onelie the Miniſterie of ane earthlie man. And as to the diſpenſatioun of his awin bodie and blood, hee will not giue it to na heauenlie creature, lat be to ane earthly man; but he hes keeped this Miniſterie to him ſelfe, and he diſpenſes his awin body and blood, to quhom & quhen he pleaſis: For quhy? gif ony man in the warld, had power to giue Chriſts body & blood, na queſtion this man ſuld haue power, to cleanſe the hart and conſcience; For the blood of Chriſt hes this power with it: and conſequently ſuld haue power to forgiue ſins. Now it is onely GOD that may forgiue ſinnes: and therefore it is not posſible,

that the Miniſterie of the heauenly thing, can be in the power of ony man. Exemple we haue in IOHN the Baptiſt, MAT. 3. 11. Sayis he not, the miniſtery that I haue is of the element, I am commaunded to Miniſter the elemēt of water only: but as to the Miniſterie of the fire & of the ſpirit, Chriſt hes reſerued it to himſelfe. Therefore looke not to get the ſpirit at mans hand, but at the hands of Chriſt himſelfe onelie, and without this inward Miniſterie, I wil not giue a ſtraa for the outward Miniſterie. For my outward Miniſterie: Ȝea, ſuppoſe it were the Miniſterie of ane Angell, and ſuppoſe Chriſt were preſent in his fleſh, to miniſter vnto ȝou thir outward things: except he conjoyne the inward miniſterie of his ſpirit therewith, it auailes nathing: It may weill make vp a dittay & proces againſt ȝou, againſt the day of that generall aſſemblie: but to ȝour ſaluation, it will neuer profite ȝou. Therefore this ȝee ſuld ay craue, that the Lord wald water ȝour harts bee his halie ſpirit, as he waters ȝour eares be the hearing of the word. Then there is twa offerers: the Miniſter offers the ſigne, Chriſt Ieſus offers himſelfe, the thing ſignified.

The three perſons, ea God, offers the Mediatour, or the Mediator offers himſelfe, and that bee the power and vertue of his awin ſpirit.
               As there is twa propiners, twa perſonsThe ſigne & the thing ſignified are offered in twa actions to twa inſtruments, and efter twa maners that offeris and geuis the Sacrament, and the thing ſignified be the Sacrament: Sa thir twa ar offered and giuen in twa actions. Chriſt, quha is the heauenlie thing is offered & giuen to ȝou, be ane inward ſecreet and ſpirituall actioun, quhilk is not ſubject to the outward eie. The ſigne againe is offered and giuen, in ane outward actioun, efter a corporal and viſible maner. As there is twa ſortes of actions, ſa there is twa ſortes of inſtrumentes, quherevnto the ſigne and the thing ſignified are offered: for the thing ſignified, that is, Chriſt: is neuer offered to the mouth of my body. The blood of Chriſt, the fleſh of Chriſt, haill Chriſt, or the ſpirit of Chriſt is not offered, nather in the word nor in the ſacrament to the mouth of my body, get me that in ony parte of the Bible, that there is ony vther maner of receauing of Chriſt, bot be faith, and tak it to thame. Sa there is not an inſtrument, as I taulde ȝou, nather hand nor

mouth to grippe Chriſt, bot faith onely. As Chriſt, quha is the thing ſignified, is gripped be the hand and mouth of faith: ſa the ſigne that ſignifies Chriſt, is gripped be our awin naturall mouth & hand. Ȝee haue a mouth in ȝour head, and in ȝour body, als proper to gripp the ſigne, as fayth is to grippe Chriſt. Swa the ſigne and the thing ſignified ar offered and giuen, not to ane inſtrument, but to twa: the ane to the mouth of the bodie, the vther to the mouth of the ſaull. Now look be quhat way thir things are offered and giuen, be the ſame way they ar receaued. As the ſigne is corporall, and naturally offered to a corporall inſtrument: ſa is it receaued efter a corporall and naturall maner. For thou man tak the bread and the wine, ather bee thy hand, or bee thy mouth: the thing ſignified is not tane efter a corporall maner, bot efter a ſecreet and ſpirituall maner: and as it is offered, ſa it is tane: there cannot be a thing clearer, the ane is tane efter a natural maner, the vther efter a ſecret and ſpirituall maner. Sa in this laſt part ȝe haue thir things to mark: diſtinguiſh me betwixt the outward action and the inward, betwixt the

ſigne and the thing ſignified, and keepe mee a proportion and analogie, betwixt the inwarde and the outward actions: Thinke weill with ȝour ſelfe, that gif ȝee bee a faithfull man, Chriſt is als bisſie working inwardlie in ȝour ſaull: as the Miniſter is working outwardlie toward ȝour bodie. Looke how bisſie the Miniſter is in breaking that bread, in powring out that wine, in giuing that bread and wine to thee; als bisſie is Chriſt in breaking his awin body to thee, and in giuing thee the iuyce of his awin bodie, efter a ſpirituall & ane inuiſible maner. Sa keepe me this diſtinction, and thinke weill with ȝour ſelfs, that be faith, Chriſt is als weill ocupied towards ȝour ſaul to nuriſh it, as the Miniſter is outwardly towardes ȝour body. Keepe me this, & thou hes the hail ſacramēt. Then of this diſcourſe & deduction: ȝe maytak vp a doble mater, quher of the Sacrament ſtands. It ſtands of twa ſorts of materials: that is, of ane earthlie mater, and of ane heauenly mater: The ſign and the thing ſignified; And as there is a double mater in the Sacrament, ſa the Sacrament mann bee handled efter a double maner, be ane outward actioun,

and ane inward action. Keepe the diſtinction in thir things, betwixt the ſign and the thing ſignified, & ȝe ſal not eaſilie ſlip in the vnderſtanding of the Sacrament.
               This being ſayd, concerning the generallof the vther parte of a Sacrament quhilk is the worde. conſideration of the elements (for al this apperteins ȝit to the elements.) It reſts that wee ſpeake ſomequhat concerning the word, quhilk I cal the vther part of the Sacrament. Quhat we meane and vnderſtand be the word, I take the word quhairvnto the elements are annexed, for that thing, quhilk quickens this haill action, quhilk ſerues as it were a ſaul, and giues life to the haill actioun. For be the worde, and the appointment of Chriſt in the worde, the Miniſter knawis quhat is his part, the hearer knawis quhat is his part, and euery ane is prepared, howe to deliuer and how to receaue: the Miniſter how hee ſuld deliuer, and the hearer how hee ſuld receaue. Sa the inſtitutioun of Chriſt, is the quickning of the haill action. For all the action hes the warrand fra the inſtitution ſet down in his word. In the inſtitution of Chriſt, there is twa things chieflie to be conſidered. Ȝee will finde in the inſtitutioun of Chriſt a command,

and ȝee will finde in it a promiſe: The commaund is this, quhere hee ſayis, take eat: the command obliſhes ȝou to obey, and craues obedience. There is a promiſe alſo in the inſtitution, and it is conteined in thir wordes, This is my bodie. The promiſe craues faith. As the command craues obedience; ſa the promiſe craues beleife: Therefore come not to the Sacrament, except ȝee bring baith faith and obedience with ȝou. Gif thou come not with a heart minded to obey Chriſt, at leaſt, mair nor thou was wont to doe, thou comes to thine awin damnation. And gif thou bring a hart alwais voyd of faith, thou comes to thine awin damnation. Sa, lat euery ane that comes to the Sacrament, bring with him a hart minded to do better, that is, to obey and beleiue Chriſt, better nor he did off before. Except ȝee bring thir twa in ſome meaſure, come not to the Sacrament: for whatever thou do, except it flow of faith, can profite nathing. This far concerning the word ſhortly.
               Nowe there reſts onely this, and it wald bee ſpeered, quhat miſter is there, that thir Sacraments and ſeales ſuld bee

annexed to the worde? Quherefore are they annexed, ſeeing wee gat na mair in the Sacrament, nor we get in the worde: and we get als meekle in the very ſimple word, as we gat in the Sacrament: Seeing then wee get na newe thing in the ſacrament, but the ſame thing, quhilk wee gat in the ſimple word, quherefore is the Sacrament appointed to bee hung to the word? It is true certainly, we get na new thing in the Sacrament: nor wee get na vther thing in the Sacrament, nor we gat in the worde, for quhat mair walde thou craue, nor to get the Sonne of God, gif thou get him weill? Thy hart cannot wiſh nor imagine a greater gift, nor to haue the Sonne of God, quha is King of heauen and earth. And therefore I ſay quhat new thing walde thou haue? For gif thou get him, thou gettis all things with him, thy hart cannot imagine a newe thinge beſide him: quherefore then is the ſacramentAnſwere. appointed? Not to get thee a newI thing. I ſay it is apointed to get thee thatBe the ſacrament wee poſſeſſe Chriſt mair fully nor be the ſimple word. ſame thing better, nor thou gat it in the word. The Sacrament is appointed, that we may get a beter grip of Chriſt, nor we gat in the ſimple word, that we may poſſeſſe

Chriſt in our harts and mindes mair fullie and largely, nor wee did off before in the ſimple worde. That Chriſt might haue a larger ſpace, to make reſidence in our narrowe hearts, nor hee could haue be the hearing of the ſimple worde: and to poſſeſſe Chriſt mair fullie, it is a better thing. For ſuppoſe Chriſt be ea thing in him ſelfe: ȝit the better grip thou haue of him, thou art the ſurer of his promiſe. The Sacramentes are appointed, that I might haue him mair fullie in my ſaull, that I might haue the bounds of it enlarged, that hee may make the better reſidence in mee: This na doubt is the cauſe, quherefore thir ſeales are annexed to the2 euident of the ſimple word. They ſerue toThey ſerue to confirme the trueth contained in the word. this end alſo, to ſeale vp and confirm the trueth, that is in the word; for as the office of the ſeale hung to the euident, is not to confirme ane vther trueth, nor that quhilk is in the euident; and ſuppoſe ȝee beleeued the euident off before; ȝit be the ſeales ȝee beleeue it the better. Euen ſa, the Sacrament aſſures mee of na vther trueth, nor is conteined within the word: Ȝit becauſe it is a ſeale annexed to the word, it perſwades mee the better of

the ſame, for ay the maa & the mair that the outward ſenſes be walkned, the mair is the inward hart & mind, perſwaded to beleif. Now the ſacrament walkens al the outward ſenſes, ſick as the eie, the hand, and all the reſt: And the outward ſenſes beeing mooued, na queſtion, the ſpirit of God concurring therewith, mooues the heart the mair. The Sacraments are then annexed to the word, to ſeal vp the truth conteined in the worde, and to confirme it mair and mair in thy hart. Then quhat haue ȝee to doe, the worde is appointed to worke beleife, and the ſacrament is appointed to confirme ȝou in this beleife: but except ȝee feele the trueth of this inwardly in ȝour harts, except ȝe haue ȝour harts als readie as ȝour mouth, think not that ony thing will auaile ȝou; All the ſeales in the warld will not worke, exceptExhortation the ſpirit of God concurre, and ſeale the ſame trueth in ȝour harts, quhilk the Sacrament ſeales outwardlie. Except hee mak cleare the ſight of thy mind inwardlie, and worke a feeling in thy hart, baith word and Sacrament, ſall tyne their fruit and effect quhilk they ſuld haue. All the Scriptures are full of this. The hail Scriptures

of GOD are but a ſlaying letter to ȝou, except the ſpirit of God concurre to quicken inwardlie. Sa ȝour haill endeuor ſuld be, to preaſe to feele Chriſt quicke in ȝour awin harts: that finding him in ȝour harts, and ſeing him in ȝour minds, baith word and Sacraments may be effectuall: gif not, ȝour ſauls remaines dead, ȝee are not tranſlated fra that death quhairin ȝe were conceaued. Therefore all the ſtudy of a Chriſtian ſuld be, quhen they ſee the Sacraments, and heares the worde, to labour to find and feele in their hearts and mindes, that, quhilk they heare and ſee, and this I cal to find Chriſt quick in ȝour awin ſauls. This cannot bee, except ȝee ſanctifie his ludging: For gif al the nukis of thy ſaul remaine a midding, Chriſt can not dwell there. And ſa, except ȝe ſtudy to a continuall ſanctification, and ſeuer ȝour ſelfe fra euery thing that ſeuers ȝou fra Chriſt; It is not posſible, that hee can liue or dwel in ȝou. This is a great leſſon, and it is not posſible to doe this, except, as I haue ſaid, a ſtronger come in & poſſeſſe vs, & make vs to renounce our ſelfs. Then, the ſeals had not bene annexed to the word, except for our cauſe. For there

is na necesſitie on Gods part, that God ſuld ather ſweare, or confirme bee ſeales, the thing that hee hes ſpoken. For his word is als good as ony aith or ſeale: but the necesſitie comes of vs. There is ſick a great weaknes in vs, that quhen hee hes ſworne, and ſet his ſeales to his word, wee are als new to beleife, as gif he had neuer ſpoken a worde. Sa to helpe our beleife, our weaknes and inhabilitie that is in vs: For wee are ſa vnable be nature, that wee can beleeue nathing, but that quhilk is of our ſelfis, and the mair wee leane to our ſelfis, the farther we are fra God. I ſay, to helpe this wonderfull weaknes, quhairby wee are readie to miſtruſt God in euerie word, he hes hung to his ſacraments, and beſide his Sacraments, hee ſweares the things that concerns maiſt our ſaluation; As ȝee hard in the Prieſthead of Chriſt, PSAL. 110. 4. Hee will not ſpeake onely, but he ſweares, and that for our weaknes and infirmitie; but gif hee abſtract ȝit the Miniſterie of his ſpirit, all thir means will do na good.
               Now, quhat is the laſt thing? The laſt is, how the Sacrament is peruerted, and

                     ent. how we are defrauded of the fruit and effect

thereof. Twa ſort of faults peruerts the Sacrament, & defrauds vs of the profite and vſe thereof, and thir faults are ather in the forme or in the perſon: In forme, gif the eſſential forme be ſpoyled, we get nathing: for quhen the ſacrament is ſpoyled of the eſſentiall forme, it is not a Sacrament. There is ane eſſential forme in Baptiſme, and ane eſſentiall forme in the Supper, quhilks gif they bee tane away, ȝee tyne the vſe of the Sacrament. The eſſentiall forme of Baptiſme is, I baptize thee in the name of the Father, the Sonne, and the halie Ghaiſt: Leaue ȝee out ane of thir three, or do ȝee it in the name of ony ane of the three perſons onely, ȝe tyne the eſſentiall forme of Baptiſme: In the Supper, gif ȝee leaue out the leaſt ceremonie, ȝe tine the eſſentiall forme; and ſa it is not a Sacrament: I ſpeake of the eſſentiall forme, in reſpect of the Papiſts, quha keeped the eſſentiall forme in Baptiſme; ſuppoſe they haue broght in trifles of their awin & mixt with it: ȝit in reſpect they keeped the ſubſtantiall forme: It is not neceſſar, that they quha were baptitized vnder thame, be rebaptized. Indeed gif the vertue of regeneration flowed fra

the perſon, it were ſome thing: but in reſpect, Chriſt hes this to giue to quhome, and quhen he pleaſis, the eſſentiall form being keeped; it is not neceſſare, that this Sacrament be reiterated. Now quhat are the faults in the perſon that peruerts the ſacrament? The fault may be, ather in the perſoun of the giuer, or in the perſoun of the receauer. (I ſpeake not of they common faults, quhilk are common to all: but of ſik faults as inhables the perſon of the giuer, to be a diſtributer of the ſacrament, & taks the office fra him.) Sa quhē the perſon of the giuer, is this way inhabled, na queſtion, it is not a Sacrament. Then againe, in the perſon of the receauer, the fault may bee, gif their children be not in the couenant, but out of it, they get not the Sacrament. Indeed, if the Parents efterward comes to the couenant, the children, ſuppoſe they be gotten out of the couenant, may be receaued. Siklike in the Supper, gif a man be ladened with ony burthen of ſinne, without ane purpoſe to repent, hee aught not to receaue it. Sa then, gif ȝee lack a purpoſe to repent, ȝe tine the vſe of the ſacrament. It is only this purpoſe to repent, that maks

me, quha receauis the ſacramēt, to get the fruit and effect thereof. Therefore euerie ane that gais to that Sacrament, looke quhat purpoſe hee hes in his heart: Hes thou a purpoſe to ſhed blood, to ga to harlatry, or to commit ony vther ill vice, or ill turne that is in thy heart, and is not of purpoſe to repent: in ſhewing thee to be without repentance, thou ſhewes thee to be without faith: And conſequentlie thou coms to thy damnation, and not to thy ſaluation. Now take heed quhat is ȝour purpoſe, for gif with a diſſolute life ȝee haue a diſſolute purpoſe, ȝee come to ȝour damnation.
               I wes of mind, to haue entred particularlyConcluſion with an exhorration. to this ſacrament, quhilk we haue in hands: but becaus the time is paſt, & ſom of ȝou (I dout not) are to cōmunicate only this: Remēber that ȝe addres not ȝour ſelfs to that table, except ȝee finde ȝour harts in ſom ſort prepared. The firſt gree of preparation ſtands in contrition, in ſorowing for ſin, in a feeling of ȝour awin ſins, quhairin ȝee haue offended God. A ſorow in ȝour harts, that ȝe haue offēded ſa gratious a God: gif ȝe bee able, as that woman wes, be the tears of a contrit hart

to weſh the feet of Chriſt, humbly to kiſſe his feet, and to get a grippe of the foot of Chriſt, ſuppoſe ȝee dare not preſume ſa high, as to get him haill, ȝe are in a good caſe. But gif thou want all thir, and hes thame not in ſome meaſure: thou lacks all the grees of preparation: Therfore lat nane ga to the table, except hee haue thir in ſom meaſure. But quhere there is a diſpleaſure for ſin, a purpoſe to do better, & an earneſt ſobbing and ſighing to get the thing that thou wants: In that ſaul quher God hes placed this deſire of Chriſt; It is the worke of Gods ſpirit, & Chriſt wil enter there. And therfore ſuppoſe that ſaul, be far fra the thing that he ſuld be at: lat him not refuſe to ga to the table, but lat him ga with a profesſioun of his awin infirmity & weaknes, & with a deſire of the thing that he wants. Euery an of ȝou that finds ȝour ſelfs this way diſpoſed, lat him ga in Gods name to the Table. And the Lord work this in every an of ȝour harts, that this Miniſterie may be effectuall in ȝou at this time, and that in the righteous merits of Ieſus Chriſt: To quhom with the Father and the halie Ghaiſt, be all honor, praiſe and glory, for now and ever,
               Amen.

And that ȝee may the better attaine to the knawledge, and conſideratioun of the great variety of mater, that is conteined in this Sacrament of the Supper: I ſal preaſe, as God will giue me the grace, to premit certaine things, for the eaſier vnderſtandingHeads to be intreated of it.

                     ncients. ſpecial reaſon with it. We find this Sacrament, called the body & blood of Chriſt. This name is giuen it, na doubt, becauſe it is a heauenly and ſpirituall nuriture; It conteins a nuriture of the ſaull, that is able to nuriſh and traine vp the ſaull, to a life ſpirituall, to that life euerlaſting: For this cauſe it is called the body and blood of Chriſt. It is called alſo the Supper of the Lorde, to put a difference betwixt it

and ane prophane Supper: for this is the Lords Supper, a halie Supper, not a prophane nor common Supper; a Supper appointed for the increaſe of halines, for the foode of the ſaull in halines, to feede the ſaul to life euerlaſting. Not a Supper appointed for the belly, for he had ended that Supper, that was appointed for the bellie, or euer hee begouth this Supper, quhilk was appointed for the ſaul. A ſupper, na doubt, hauing reſpect to the circumſtaunce of time, be reaſon it was firſt inſtituted in the article of that time, whē they vſed to ſuppe. It is called alſo in the Bible, the Table of the Lord: It is not called the Altar of the Lord, but the Apoſtle cals it a Table to ſit at, and not ane altar to ſtand at, a Table to take and receaue, and not an Altar to offer & propine. It is called alſo the Communion, & participaon of the bodie and blood of Chriſt: We haue thir names giuen to it, beſide ſome vthers in the Scriptures of God.
               The auncients of the Latine, and of the Greeke Kirks, gaue it ſundry names, for ſundry reſpects: They called it a publict action. And this was a very general name; Sometimes they called it a thankſgiuing:

Sometimes they called it a Banquet of loue: & ſometimes they gaue it ea name, and somtimes ane vther. And at the laſt, in the declining eſtait of the Latine Kirk, and in the falling eſtait of the Romane Kirk, this Sacrament begouth to be peruerted, and with this decay, there comes in a peruerſe name, and they called it the Maſſe. They trouble thameſelfs meekle concerning the deriuation of this name, quherefra this worde is driuen: Sometime they ſeeke it fra ane Hebrue origine: Somtime fra an Greeke, and ſometime fra ane Latine origine. But it is plaine, as the word ſounds, that it is tane fra ane Latine origine. And it is a worde quhilk might haue bene tolerable, quhen it was firſt inſtituted: For na doubt, the Sacrament at the firſt inſtitutioun of this word, wes not then halely peruerted: but now, ſeeing that be the proceſſe of time, corruption hes preuailed ſa far, that it hes turned over our Sacrament in a ſacrifice: And quhere wee ſuld take fra the hand of God in Chriſt, they make vs to giue: This is plaine Idolatry: And therefore quhere the word was tolerable before; Nowe it ought not to bee tolerable

in ony way; It aught not to bee ſuffered. And out of queſtioun, gif wee had eaten and drunken, als oft the body and blood of Chriſt in our harts and ſaules, as wee haue eaten that bread, and drunken that wine, quhilk are the ſignes of his bodie and blood: wee wald not haue thoiled this word of the maſſe; lat be the very action of it, to be ſa rife in this Countrey: But in reſpect, wee haue but played the counterfait, and defrauded our ſauls of the bodie and blood of Chriſt, and tooke onely the outward Sacrament: Therefore it is, that our zeale decayis: Therefore it is that our loue decayis: Therefore it is that our knawledge and light decayis. And for fault of zeale, loue, and knawledge, the worde of the maſſe is become cuſtomable vnto ȝou, and not onely the word, but the very action. I will not run out heir, I am onely tell and ȝou, quhat comes of the abuſe of the hearing of the worde, quhat iudgement followes vpon the abuſe of the perception of the Sacraments.

                      generall. quherefore the Sacrament wes appointed. This Sacrament was inſtituted in the

ſignes of bread and wine, and wes appointedOf the ends quhy this ſacrament wes inſtituted. chieflie for this end, to repreſent our ſpirituall nuriture, the ful and perfite nuriture of our ſaull. That as he quha hes bread and wine, lacks nathing of the full nuriture of his bodie: ſa he, or that ſaul, quha hes the participation of the bodie and blood of Chriſt, lacks nathing of the full and perfite nuriture of the ſaull: To repreſent this full and perfite nuriture, the ſignes of bread and wine in the ſacrament, were ſet downe and inſtituted. The ſecond ende, quherefore this Sacrament wes inſtituted, is this; that wee might teſtifie to the warld, and to the Princes of the warld, quha are enemies to our profesſion, that we might openly avow, and teſtifie vnto thame our religion, and our maner of worſhipping: in the quhilk wee avow and worſhip Chriſt: And that wee might alſo teſtifie our loue towardes his members, our brethren; this is the ſecond ende quherefore it wes inſtituted. The third end, quherefore it wes inſtituted, is this; to ſerue for our ſpeciall comfort and conſolation, to ſerue as a ſouerain medicin for al our ſpiritual diſeaſes, as we find our ſelfs ather ready to fall, or

prouoked to fall bee the Deuill, the fleſh or the warld; or efter that we haue fallen, and are put to flight bee the Deuill, and wald faine flee away fra God; God of his mercie, and of his infinite pitie, and bothomles compasſion, hes ſet vp this Sacrament, as a ſigne on a high hil, quhairby it may be ſeene on euerie ſide, far and neare, to call all thame againe, that haue run ſhamefully away; and hee clockes to thame, as a Hen dois to her chickens, to gather thame vnder the wings of his infinite mercie. The fourth end, quherefore this ſacrament wes inſtituted, is this; that in this action, wee might thanke him for his benefites, and rander to him heartie thankes, that hee hes come downe ſa familiarlie to vs, bowed the heauens, as it were, and giuen vs the body and blood of his awin Sonne, that we might rander vnto him hartie thankes, and ſa ſanctifie his benefits to vs: for this thankſgiuing, this Sacrament wes alſo inſtituted. This far concerning the ends ſhortly.

There is againe hid fra the eie ofof the things conteined in this Sacrament out ward and inwarde, quherein ſundric heads are intreated. ȝour body, but preſent to the eie of ȝour mynd, ſpirituall things, heauenly and inward thinges, baith thir are in the Sacrament. The corporal, viſible, and outward things, they are the thinges that are appointed, to ſignifie the ſpiritual, heauenly and inwarde things: And quhy? Nathing without a reaſoun. Thir corporall ſignes are appointed to ſignifie the ſpirituall things, be reaſoun wee are corporall, we are earthlie bodies, wee haue our ſaull ludging within ane carnall body, in a tabernacle of claye, a groſſe tabernacle, quhilk cannot be walkned nor mooued, except bee the things that are like to it ſelfe: It cannot be induced to the conſideration of heauenlie things, except, be gros, temporall and corporal things. Gif wee had beene of the nature of the thing ſignified, that as the thing ſignified is ſpirituall and heauenlie, ſa wee alway had bene ſpirituall and heauenlie; we had not miſtered a corporal thing. Siclike, gif the thing ſignified had bin as we are, corporall, earthlie and viſible; wee had not miſtered a ſigne, to cary vs to the conſideration of it. But be reaſon the thing ſignified

is ſpirituall, and wee are corporall; therefore to bring vs to the ſight of thir ſpirituall things, he vſes a corporal mean and an outward ſigne. This is the reſoun quherefore thir corporall ſignes are appointed, to ſignifie the ſpirituall thing. The ſpirituall thing in baith the Sacraments, is ane & the ſelfe ſame Chriſt Ieſus, ſignified in baith the Sacraments: Ȝit in diuers reſpects, he is the thing ſignified in Baptiſme, and he is the thing ſignified in the Supper. This Chriſt Ieſus in his blood chiefly, is the thing ſignified in the Sacrament of Baptiſm; for quhy? be reſon that be his blood hee weſchis the filth of our ſauls; bee reaſon that be the vertue of his blood, he quickens vs in our ſauls, with a heauenlie life; be reaſoun that bee the power of his blood, he ingrafts and imps vs in his awin body: for that ſacrament is a teſtimonie of the remisſioun of our ſinnes; that is of the cleanes of our conſcience, that our conſciences be that blood, are weſchen inwardly. It teſtifies ſiklike, of our new birth, that wee are begotten ſpiritually to a heauenly life: It teſtifies ſicklike, of the joyning of vs in the body of Chriſt. As it is a teſtimony, ſa it is

a ſeale; It not only teſtifies, but ſeales it vp in our harts, and maks vs in our harts, to feele the taiſt of that heauenly life begun in vs; that we are tranſlated fra death, in the quhilk we war conceaued, & imped in the body of Chriſt. Tak heed then, Chriſt in his blood, as he is the lawer of our regeneration, is the thing ſignified in Baptiſme. In this ſacrament of the Supper agane, this ſame Chriſt, is the thing ſignified in ane vther reſpect; to witt, in this reſpect, as his body and blood ſerues to nuriſh my ſaul to life everlaſting; for this ſacrament is na vther thing, but the Image of our ſpirituall nuriture, God teſtifing howe our ſauls are fed, and nuriſched to that heauenly life, bee the Image of ane corporal nuriture▪ Swa, in diuers reſpects the ſame thing; that is, Chriſt Ieſus, is ſignified in baptiſme, and is ſignified in the Supper. In this Sacrament the fruits of Chriſts death, quhereof I ſpake, the vertue of his ſacrifice, the vertue of his pasſioun: I call not thir fruits nor thir vertues onely, the thing ſignified in the Sacrament of the Supper; but rather I call the thing ſignified, that ſubſtance, & that perſon, out of the quhilk ſubſtance, this

vertue, and thir fruits dois flow and proceed. I grant to thee, and it is maiſt certaine, that bee the lawfull vſe and participation of the Sacrament, thou art partaker of all thir fruites, ȝit thir fruites are not the firſt & cheife thing, quherof thou art partaker in this ſacrament; but of force thou man get ane vther thing firſt. It is true, that na man can be partaker of the ſubſtance of Chriſt, but the ſame ſaul mann be alſo partaker of the fruites that flowis fra his ſubſtance: Ȝit notwithſtanding, thou man diſcerne betwixt the ſubſtance, and the fruits that flowis fra the ſubſtance, and thou mann be partaker of the ſubſtance in the firſt roume. Then in the nixt roume, thou mann bee partaker of the frutes that flows fra his ſubſtance. To mak this clear in baptiſme, the frutes of baptiſme, are remisſion of our ſinnes, mortification, the ſlaughter of ſinne, and the ſealing vp of our adoptioun to life everlaſting. The ſubſtaunce, out of the quhilk thir fruites dois flow, is the blood of Chriſt: Ȝe mann heir of force diſcerne betwixt the blud quhilk is the ſubſtance, and betwixt remisſioun of ſinnes, weſching and regeneratioun, quhilk are the

fruites that flowis fra this blood. Sicklike in the ſacrament of the ſupper. The fruits of the Sacrament, ar the growth of fayth and the incres in halines. The thing ſignified, is the ſubſtance; that is, the body and blood of Chriſt is the ſubſtance, out of the quhilk, this growth in faith & halines dois proceed. Now ſee ȝee not this; ȝee mann diſcerne then betwixt the ſubſtance and the fruits, and ȝe mann place the ſubſtance in the firſt roume, ſa that the ſubſtance of Chriſt, that is, Chriſt him ſelfe is the thing ſignified in this Sacrament; for ȝour awin experience makis this cleare vnto ȝou: or ȝour ſtomach be filled with ony foode, ȝee mann eat the ſubſtance of the food firſt, or ȝee bee filled with bread, ȝee man eat the ſubſtance of that bread firſt: Or ȝour drowth bee quenched with ony drinke, ȝee mann of force, drinke the ſubſtance of the drinke firſt. Euen ſa, efter this ſamemaner, or the hunger of ȝour ſaules bee ſatisfied, and the thirſt thereof quenched, ȝee man eat the fleſh of Chriſt, and drinke his blood firſt, and that be faith. Sa conſider the ane be the vther; looke to quhat vſe bread & wine ſerues to thy body, to the ſame very

vſe, the body and blood of Chriſt ſerues to thy ſaull, and hee that appointed the ane to ſerue for thy body, the ſame God appointed the vther to ſerue for thy ſaul. Swa look how imposſible it is to thee, to be fed with that foode that coms neuer in thy mouth, or to recouer helth of that drog quhilk wes neuer applied, nor come neuer out of the Apothecaries booth: It is als imposſible to thee, to bee fed vpon the body of Chriſt, and to get thy health of the blood of Chriſt, except thou firſt eat his body and drinke his blood. Then ȝe ſee, that the thing ſignified in the ſupper, is not the fruit ſa meekle, as the bodie & blood of Chriſt Ieſus, quhilk is the fountaine and ſubſtaunce, quhairfra thir fruits dois flow and proceed.
               Now I ſay, ſuppoſe Chriſt quha is theThe thing ſignified in baith the ſacraments is an, the ſigns are not ane. thing ſignified, remaine ay ane, and the ſame in baith the Sacraments: ȝit the ſignes quhairby this ane Chriſt is ſignified in the Sacraments are not ane, nor of ane equall number nather: for in Baptiſme, the thing that repreſents Chriſt, is water: Into the ſupper, the things that repreſents Chriſt, are bread & wine. Water is appointed to repreſent Chriſt in Baptiſme,

and quhy? Hee hes choſen out water, becauſe it is meeteſt to repreſent the blood of Chriſt, to repreſent our weſhing with the blood of Chriſt. For quhat is meeter to weſh with, nor water? Sa there is nathing meeter to weſh the ſaull, nor the blood of Chriſt. Into this Sacrament, he hes appointed bread and wine; quhy? Becauſe there is nathing meeter to nuriſh the bodie, nor bread and wine. Sa the Lorde hes not choſen thir ſignes without a reaſon. As the ſignes in the ſacraments are not alwayis ane; ſa the ſame in baith, are not of ane number: For in Baptiſme, wee haue but ane element, into this Sacrament wee haue twa elements. Now quhat is the reſon of this diuerſity,Qahy in baptiſme there is but ane ſigne, and in the Supper twa. that the Lord in the ane Sacrament, hes appointed twa ſigns, and in the vther but ane ſigne? I ſall giue ȝou the reaſon: hee hes appointed only ane ſigne in Baptiſm, to wit, water: becauſe water is ſufficient aneugh to doe the haill turne. Gif water had not beene ſufficient to repreſent the thing ſignified, hee wald haue appointed ane vther ſigne: but in reſpect, water dois the turne, and repreſents fullie the weſhing of our ſauls, with the blood

of Chriſt: quhat miſter then haue wee of ane vther ſigne? Now in this Sacrament, ane ſigne will not ſuffice, but there mann be twa: for quhy? Wine cannot be ſufficient alane, nor breade can not bee ſufficient alane: For hee that hes bread onely, and wine onely, hes not a perfite nuriture corporall; therefore, that they might repreſent and lat vs ſee, a perfite nuriture, he hes giuen vs, baith bread and wine: (For the perfite nuriture corporall, ſtands in meat and drinke) to repreſent the full and perfite nuriture of the ſaul. Looke how full and perfite a nuriture, he hes to his bodie, that hes ſtore of bread and wine; ſa hee that hes Chriſt, laks nathing of a full and perfite nuriture to his ſaul. Then ȝe ſee the reaſon, quherfore there is twa ſignes appointed in this Sacrament, and onelie ane ſigne in Baptiſme.

Then ſpeeres thou of the power? That bread, hes a power flowing fra Chriſt and his inſtitutioun, quhilk vther common bread hes not: Sa that, gif ony of ȝou wald ſpeere, quhen the Miniſter in this action, is breaking or diſtributing that bread, powring out, and diſtributing that wine: gif ȝou wald ſpeare, quhat ſort of creatures are ȝone? A ready anſwere heere; they are halie thinges; ȝee mann giue this name, to the ſignes and ſeales of the bodie and blood of Chriſt. That bread of the Sacrament is ane halie bread, & that wine is an haly wine, quhy? Becauſe, the bleſſed inſtitution of Chriſt, hes ſeuered tham fra the vſe, quhereunto they ſerued of before, & hes aplied tham to an haly vſe; not to feed the bodie, but to feed the ſaull. This far concerning the power of that bread: It hes a power, flowing fra Chriſt & his inſtitution. Now the

ſecond thing is this: how lang continues this power with that bread? Howe lang hes that bread this office? In a worde, I2. Anſwer That power continues induring the ſeruice of the table ſay, this power ſticks with that bread, induring the time of the actioun, induring the ſeruice of the table. Looke how lang that action continues, and that the ſeruice of the Table laſts: ſa lang it continues ane halie bread, ſa lang continues the power with that bread: but looke how ſoone, the action is ended; ſa ſoone ends the halines of it: Looke how ſoone the ſeruice of the Table is ended; that bread becomes common againe, and the halines of it ceaſis. Then this power continues not for ay, but it continues, onely induring the time of the action and ſeruice of the Table: this far concerning the elements.
               There is beſide the elements, an vtherOf the ceremonial ſigns ſort of ſignes in the Sacrament: there is not a reat nor ceremony in the Sacrament of the Supper, but euerie reat and ceremonie is a ſigne, and hes the awin ſpirituall ſignification with it: As namelie, looking to the breaking of that bred, it repreſents to thee, the breaking of the bodie and blood of Chriſt: not that his

body was broken in bone or lith, but that it was broken with dolour, with anguiſh and diſtres of hart, with the weight of the indignation and furie of God, that he ſuſtained for our ſins quhilk hee bure. Then the breaking is ane eſſentiall ceremonie: the powring out of the wine, alſo is ane eſſentiall ceremonie: For quhy? as ȝee ſee clearlie, that be the wine, is ſignified the blood of Chriſt: ſa bee the powring out of the wine, is ſignified, that his blood was ſeuered fra his fleſh, and the ſeuering of thir twa, makes death; for in blood is the life, and conſequentlie it teſtifies his death. The powring out of the wine, then tels thee, that hee dieth for thee, that his blood was ſhed for thee: Sa this is an eſſential ceremonie, quhilk man not be left out. Siclike, the diſtribution, giuing & eating of that bread, are eſſentiall ceremonies: And quhat dois the eating teſtifie to thee? The applying of the bodie and blood of Chriſt to thy ſaul: Sa that there is neuer ane of thir reits, but they haue there awin ſignificatioun, and there can not ane of thame bee left out, but ȝee ſall peruert the haill action. This far concerning the ſignes.
               
                  Nowe quhat profite can ȝee make ofAn obſeruation. all this diſcourſe? Cary mee this leſſoun with you, and ȝee ſall make ȝour profite of thir things: In reſpect that every ſigne and ceremonie, hes the awin ſpirituall ſignificatioun: Sa that there is not a ceremonie in this haill actioun, that wants the awin ſpirituall ſignificatioun. Take vp this conſideratioun, and thinke with ȝour ſelfes in that time eſpecially, quhen ȝee are at the Table, and in the ſight of that actioun; that looke quhat thou ſees the Miniſter dooing outwardelie, quhat ever it bee: Is hee breaking that bread, is hee dealing that bread? Is hee powring out that wine, and diſtributing that wine? Thinke weill with thy ſelfe, that Chriſt is als bisſie doing al thir thinges ſpiritually to thy ſaul; hee is als bisſie giuing to thee his awin bodie, with his awin hand: hee is als bisſie giuing to thee his awin blood, with the vertue and efficacie of it: Siclike in this actioun, (gif thou bee an faithfull communicant) looke quhat the mouth dois, and howe the, mouth of the bodie is occupied outwardelie: Sa is the hand and mouth of the ſaul (quhilk is fayth) ocupied inwardlie.

As the mouth takis that bread and that wine, ſa the mouth of thy ſaull takis the bodie and blood of Chriſt, and that bee faith: for bee faith, and a conſtant perſwaſioun, is the onely way to eat the bodie, and drinke the blood of Chriſt inwardlye, and doing this, there cannot but followe a fruitfull manducatioun. This farre, for the conſideratioun of the ſignes.
               Nowe comes in the matter, quherein greteſt difficultie ſtandis, quhereof I ſpakHowe the ſignes and the thing ſignified are conjoyned in the Sacrament. the laſt day as God gaue me the grace, ȝit in the particular wee man ſpeake, as weil as in the generall, but ſomequhat mair ſchortlie. Then ȝee haue to vnderſtande for the better informatioun of ȝour conſcience, and for the better preparation of ȝour ſauls: ȝee haue to vnderſtand how that bread and that wine, quhilk are the ſignes, are cowpled with the bodie and blood of Chriſt, quhilk are ſignified therby; quhat ſort of conjunctioun is this, & quherefra flowes this conjunctioun, I ſall be ſhort in it, becaus I ſpak of it at great length the laſt day. Take heede, for and ȝee giue not attendance, it is not posſible that ȝee can take vp this conjunction. As

to this ſort of conjunction, how thir twa are cowpled, wald ȝee knawe it? Doe this firſt. Take tent firſt of all, to the nature of the ſignes, and to the nature of the thing ſignified, ȝe man take tent to baith their natures, and quhy? Be reſon nathing can be coupled nor conjoined with an vther, but in ſa far as the nature of it will ſuffer: gif the nature of it wil not ſuffer ane conjunctioun, they cannot be conjoyned: or will the nature of it ſuffer a conjunction, looke how far it will ſuffer a conjunction, ſa far are thay conjoyned. Nowe mann I looke to the nature of the things that ar conjoyned? Ȝis: Firſt of all then, looke to the thing ſignified, quhat is the nature of the thing ſignified; looking to this, thou ſeeis that the thing ſignified is of a ſpirituall nature, of a heauenlie and miſticall nature; Then conclude, na queſtioun this ſpirituall thing wil ſuffer a ſpirituall conjunction, a myſticall and ſecreet conjunction. Looke over agane to the ſigne: The ſigne of his nature, as I taulde ȝou in the beginning, hes a relatioun to the thinge ſignified. And the thing ſignified of his nature, hes a relatioun to the ſigne. Swa then the ſigne and the thing ſignified wil

ſuffer to be conjoyned be ane mutual relatioun: Baith the ſign and the thing ſignified, in reſpect they haue a mutuall relatioun the ane to the vther, they wil ſuffer thame ſelfes to be conjoyned be a relatiue conjunction. Now ſpeer ȝe at me, quhat ſorte of conjunctioun is betwixt that bread and that wine, and the bodie and blod of Chriſt. To tel ȝou in a word, I ſay it is a ſecreet and ſpirituall conjunctioun, ſick a conjunction as ſtands in a mutuall reſpect, betwixt that bread and the bodie of Chriſt, & betwixt that wine, and the blood of Chriſt. Then I ſay, it is a ſecreet and a ſpirituall conjunctioun. Thou wald not bee ſa inquiſitiue of this conjunction, gif it were corporal, viſible, or local, gif thou ſaw thame baith before thine eies, thou wald not ſpeer how they are conjoyned: Or gif thou ſawe thame baith in an place; but in reſpect thou ſees but the ane with thine eie, & the vther is hid: this makis the conjunction the mair difficill to be vttered and vnderſtanden. And howe is it posſible that ȝee can take vp this ſecreet and hid conjunctioun▪ except ȝee haue the eies of ȝour mind illuminat bee the ſpirit, quhereby ȝee may

come to the right vnderſtanding of it: But gif ȝee haue ony inſight in thir ſpirituall maters that comes bee fayth, this conjunction ſall apeare als cleirly be the eie of ȝour faith, as the Phiſicall conjunctioun dois to the eie of ȝour body. Now will ȝee haue this mater maide plaine. There is ane vther conjunctioun quhilk ſerues to make this conjunctioun very clear: To wit, the conjunction betwix the worde quhilk I ſpeake, and the thing ſignified bee that ſame worde. Speake I of things to ȝou in a language that ȝee vnderſtand: As be gods grace ȝe vnderſtād this language now; ſpeake I of things bigane, and it were neuer ſa lang ſyne: ſpeake I of things to come, and they were neuer ſa far off: ſpeake I of things abſent and they were neuer ſa far diſtant: Ȝit ſa ſone as I ſpeake the word; quhither it be of things bigane or to come, the thing it ſelfe will come in ȝour minde. The word ſtreiks not ſa ſoone in ȝour eire, but the thing ſignified be the ſame worde come in ȝour mind. Quhat maks the thing ſignified, ſuppoſe it be abſent, to com in my minde? This could not be, except there were a conjunction betwix the word and

the thing ſignified bee the worde: As for exāple, ſpeake I of the King, quha is now a good peece diſtant from vs, (I pray god ſaue him) ȝee will not ſa ſoone hear the word, but the King quha is the thing ſignified bee this worde, will come in ȝour mynd. Speake I of things bigan, ſuppoſe they be already expired, ȝit the thing ſignified wil ay com in your mind: Sa there is a conjunction ȝe ſee, betwixt the word and the thing ſignified be the word. Tak heed to this conjunctioun, and ȝe ſal get the nature of the conjunction, and cowpling of the ſign with the thing ſignified in the Sacrament: for looke quhat ſorte of conjunctioun is betwixt the word and the thing ſignified be the word, that ſam ſort of conjunction, is betwixt the ſacrament, quhilk is ſene to the eie of ȝour bodie, and the thing ſignified bee the ſacrament, quhilk is ſeene to the eie of ȝour ſaull onely. As for example, ſa ſoone as thou ſeeis that bread tane in the hand of the Miniſter, thou ſeeis it not ſa ſoone, but incontinent the bodie of Chriſt man come in thy minde: thir twa are ſa conjoyned, that thay come baith togither: the ane to the outwarde ſenſes, the vther

to the inward ſenſes. This is not aneugh now, but becaus in the inſtitution, ȝe are commanded to ga farther, and not only to look to that bread and that wine, but to take that bread and that wine: Incontinent as ȝour hand taks the ane, ſa ȝour hart taks the vther: as ȝour teeth eats the ane, ſa the teeth of ȝour ſaull quhilke is faith, eats the vther, that is▪ applies Chriſt to ȝour ſaull. Swa ȝee ſee, there is a conjunctioun heir, ſecreet and myſticall: and therfore Chriſt cannot be conjoyned but be a ſecreet and myſticall conjunctioun. The conjunction betwixt Chriſt and vs, is a ſecret and myſtical conjunction, quhilk the Apoſtle EPHES. 5. cals that ſpirituall conjunctioun, full of ane high myſterie. This conjunctioun cannot be tane vp at the firſt: Sa ſeeing the conjunctioun is ſecret and ſpiritual, and not perceaued but be the ſpirit of God: All is for nocht, except ȝee haue ſome portioun and meſure of his ſpirit; Al that is taught in the word and ſacraments, will neuer do you good; will neuer cary ȝour ſaull to heauen, except the ſpirit of GOD illuminat ȝour mindes, and make ȝou to finde in ȝour ſauls, the thing that ȝe hear in the word.

Then learne this, ſeeing the worde cannot bee vnderſtand, but bee the ſpirit of God: craue that the Lord wald illuminat the eies of ȝour mindes be his ſpirit: and be ȝee als cairfull to get the ſpirit, as ȝee are cairfull nowe in the hearing of the word. This far concerning the conjunctioun.
               Now ȝe haue hard, how the ſigne is conjoynedHowe the ſigne and 
                        •
                     he thing ſignified ar receaued. with the thing ſignified: Quhat reſts there for ȝou to knaw? There reſts to knaw, how the ſigne is receaued, and how the thing ſignified is receaued; quhider they bee baith receaued with ane mouth or not: quhider the ſigne and the thing ſignified, bee receaued efter ane faſhion & maner or not: And marking me the diuers manner of receauing, and the diuerſitie of the inſtruments: ȝee ſall not eaſilie erre in the Sacrament. The ſigne and the thing ſignified, are receaued bee twa mouthes, for ȝee ſee the ſigns, that is, that bread and wine, quhervnto thay are geuin, they are giuen to the mouth of the body: Then the mouth of the bodie is the inſtrument that receuis that bread and that wine, quhilk are the ſignes. As that bread, and that

wine, are viſible and corporall; ſa the mouth and inſtrument quherby they are receaued, is viſible and corporall. The thing ſignified bee the bread and wine, is not receaued be the mouth of the body: Na, the Scriptures denies that plainelie; but hee is receaued, be the mouth of the ſaull. Then there is twa mouthes; that bread, & that wine, quhilk are the ſigns, are receaued be the mouth of the bodie: Chriſt, quha is the thing ſignified, is receaued be the mouth of the ſaul; that is, be a true faith. Swa, bring me not to the Table, ane mouth onely (for gif ȝee bring the mouth of ȝour body only, al is wrāg) but bring with ȝou alſo, the mouth of the ſaull, a conſtant perſwaſion in the death of Chriſt, and all gaies weill. Now, as to the maner, how the ſigns are receaued, & the faſhion how the thing ſignified is receaued: Ȝee may eaſilie knawe, that thir corporall and naturall ſignes, mann bee receaued efter a corporall and naturall maner: They mann bee taken, with the hand or mouth of the bodie. Againe, a ſupernaturall thing mann bee receaued, efter a ſupernaturall maner: A ſpirituall thing, mann be receaued, efter a ſpiritual

maner. Swa, as the ſignes are corporall, & receaued efter a corporall maner, with the hand, or the mouth of the bodie: ſiclike, the thing ſignified is ſpirituall, and receaued efter a ſpiritual maner, with the hand and mouth of the ſaull; quhilk is true faith. Then ȝe haue ſhortly tane vp vnto ȝou, the hail preparation, that is neceſſarie for the vnderſtanding of this Sacrament.
               Now, quhat doctrin gather I of this? Of this laſt point, quhere I ſay, that Chriſt isQuhat kind

                      the ſacrament, the thing ſignified, and cannot bee perceaued, but be faith, cannot be receaued nor digeſted, but bee ane faithfull ſaull: quhat kinde of perception eſtabliſh I, in this ſacrament? I eſtabliſh na kind of perception of Chriſt, but a ſpirituall perception; hee cannot be receaued, nor perceaued but bee faith; and faith is ſpirituall. Therfore in the Sacramēt, I eſtabliſh only a ſpirituall perception of Chriſt, and not ane orall, carnall, or fleſhlie perceptioun. This is the ground: now lat ſee, quhat inconuenient can folow vpon this ground? The Papiſts ſayis, that vpon this ground, this inconuenient ſall folowe: gif there be na perception of Chriſt, but a ſpirituall

perception (ſay they) then ȝour ſacramentInconuenients, caſte

Gif there bee na way, ſayis the Papiſts, to perceaue Chriſt, but be faith; quhat miſters ȝou a Sacrament? Ȝee perceaue Chriſt be faith in the word, be the naked and ſimple preaching of the worde ȝee get faith; ſa the ſimple word may ſtaike ȝou; quhat miſter haue ȝee of a Sacrament; gif ȝee get not ſome newe thing in the Sacrament, quhilk ȝee culd not get in the word? This is their argument, quherof ȝe ſee their cōcluſion to be this: we get na vther new thing in theFirſt inconuenient. That the ſacrament is ſuperfluous. Sacrament, vther nor we do in the word: gif there be na perception but ſpirituall: Ergo, the Sacrament is ſuperfluous. Wee admit the antecedent to be true, wee get na vther thing, nor na newe thing in the Sacrament, but the ſame thing, quhilk we gat in the word. I will giue thee to deuiſe, and imagine with thy ſelfe, quhat newe thing wald thou haue: Lat the heart of man deuiſe imagine, and wiſh; hee durſt neuer haue excogitat, to haue ſik a thing, at the Sonne of God, he durſt neuer haue preſumed, to haue pearſed the clouds, to

haue gane ſa heigh, and to haue craued the Sonne of GOD in his fleſh, to bee the food of his ſaull; hauing the Son of God, thou hes him, quha is the air of al things; quha is King of Heauen and Earth, and in him thou hes all thinges; quhat mair then can thou wiſh? Quhat better thing can thou wiſh? Hee is equall with the Father, ane in ſubſtaunce with the Father, true God, and true man; quhat mair can thou wiſh? Then I ſay, wee get na vther thing in the Sacrament, nor we get in the word; content thee with this: But ſuppoſe it bee ſa; ȝit the Sacrament is not ſuperfluous. But wald thou vnderſtand, quhatRefutation of their firſt inconuenient. newe thing thou gets, quhat vther thing thou gets: I will tell thee; ſuppoſe thou get that ſame thing, quhilk thou gat in the worde; ȝit thou gets that ſame thing better: quhat is that better? Thou gets a better grip of that ſame thing in the ſacrament, nor thou gat be the hearing of the worde. That ſame thing, quhilk thou poſſeſſed, be the hering of the word, thou poſſeſſeſt now mair largely, he hes a greater bounds in thy ſaull, be the receauing of the Sacramēt, nor vtherways he could haue, be the hearing of the worde onelie.

Then ſpeers thou, quhat newe thing wee get? I ſay, we get this new thing, wee get Chriſt better nor we did before, wee get the thing that we gat, mair fullie, that is, with a ſurer apprehenſion, nor we had off before; wee get a better grippe of Chriſt nowe: For be the Sacrament, my faith is nuriſhed, the bounds of my ſaull is enlarged, and ſa, quhere I had but a little grip of Chriſt before; as it were, betwixt my finger and my thoumbe; nowe I get him in my haill hande, and ay the mair, that my faith growes, the better grip I get of Chriſt Ieſus. Sa the Sacrament is felloun neceſſarie, and it were na mair, but to get Chriſt better, and to get a faſter apprehenſion of him be the Sacrament, nor we culd haue off before: For gif it were true, that the Sacrament is ſuperfluous: be the ſame reaſon it ſall follow alſo, that the repetition of the Sacrament, is ſuperfluous; for quhen ȝe come to the Sacrament the ſecond time, ȝee gat na vther thing, nor ȝee did the firſt time: quhen ȝee come to the Sacrament the third time, ȝee gat na vther thing, nor ȝee did the firſt time: and ȝit na man wil ſay, that the third and ſecond comming is a ſuperfluous thing;

and quhy? Becauſe in the ſecond comming, my faith is augmented: I vnderſtand better, I grow in knawledge, I grow in apprehenſioun, I grow in feeling; and getting the grouth of all thir, als oft as I come: There is na man will ſay, that the oft comming to the Sacrament is ſuperfluous, and it were, ilk day ains; Sa their firſt inconuenient, availes not; wee get na newe thing in the Sacrament: Ergo, the Sacramentis ſuperfluous. This farre for the firſt.
               Then there comes on ane vther thing on the ſame ground: Gif Chriſt bee not perceaued but be faith; then ſay wee, na wicked bodie can perceaue him; hee that lacks faith, cannot perceaue him; he that lacks faith, may perceaue that Sacrament of that bread, and that wine, and may eat of that bread, and that wine; but he that lacks faith, may not eat of the bodie and blood of Chriſt, ſignified bee that bread, and be that wine. Sa there is the ground: Na faithles people can perceaue Chriſt,Second inconuenient nor eat the bodie of Chriſt in the Sacrament. Againſt this ground, they delaſh their artillerie ſiclike, and they bring their argument out of the ſame wordes

of the Apoſtle quhilk I haue read. The words are thir: He that eats of this bread vnworthely, ſayis the Apoſtle, and drinks of this cup vnworthely, is guiltie of the body and blood of Chriſt: Theris their ground; Sa that their argument will ſuffer this forme, as gif they wald ſay, efter this maner: Na man can bee giltie of that thing, quhilk hee hes not receaued; they haue not receaued the bodie and blood of Chriſt: therefore they cannot be giltie of the bodie and blood of Chriſt: but ſa it is; the Apoſtle ſayis, they are guilty: therfore they haue receaued the bodie and blood of Chriſt. I anſwere to the propoſition,Refutation of the ſecond inconnient obiected, quhere in, are ſundry reaſons giuen, quhy the wicked are counted guilty of the body and blood of Chriſt▪
                   and I ſay, it is very falſe: They could not be giltie of that bodie and blood, except they had receaued it: For they may bee guiltie of that ſame bodie, and of that ſame blood, ſuppoſe they neuer receaued it, but tak heed to the text. The text ſayis not, that they eat the bodie of Chriſt vnworthelie, but it ſayes that they eat that bread, and drinks that wine vnworthely. And ȝit becauſe they eat that bread, and drinks that wine vnworthelie, they are compted before God, guilty of the body

and blood of Chriſt. Now quherefore is this? Not becauſe they receaue him, for gif they receaued him, they culd not but receaue him worthelie, for Chriſt cannot be receaued of any man, but worthelie. But they are compted guilty of the body and blood of the Sonne of God, becauſe they refuſed him: For quhen they did eat that bread, and drinke that wine, they might, gif they had had fayth, eaten and drunken the fleſh and blood of Chriſt Ieſus: Now becauſe thou refuſes the bodie of Chriſt offered to thee, thou contemns this body offered to thee, gif thou haue not ane eie to diſcerne and judge, vpon this bodie that is offered: For gif they had had fayth, they might haue ſeene his bodie offered with the bread, bee fayth they might haue tane that ſame bodie, & be faith they might haue eaten that ſame bodie; therefore lacking their ſpowſing garment, lacking faith, quhereby they ſuld eat the bodie, and drinke the blood of Chriſt: lacking faith quhilk is the eie of the ſaul to perſeaue, and the mouth of the ſaull to receaue that bodie, quhilk is ſpiritually offered, they ar compted guiltie of that ſame bodie and blood. Nowe

come on, this may be made mair clear be a ſimilitude▪ Ȝe ſee amangs warldly princes, their cuſtome is, they will not ſuffer their majeſtie to be intereſt in the ſmaleſt thing that they haue: Quher can there be a ſmaller thing, that concernis the majeſtie of a Prince, nor a ſeall, for the ſubſtance of it is but wax, ȝit gif thou diſdainfully vſe that ſeall, and contemne it, and ſtampe it vnder thy feete, thou art compted als guiltie of his bodie & blood as hee that puttis hand in him, and thou wil be handled efter ea way: meikle mair, gif thou come as ane Sow, or as ane Dog to handle the ſeals of the body & blood of Chriſt, mekle mair may thou be compted to be guiltie of his body, and of his blood. This far for the eating of the bodie of Chriſt: The wicked cannot eat the bodie of Chriſt, but they may be guiltie of it. The Apoſtle maks this ſpeach mair clear ȝit, bee ane vther ſpeach quhilke I haue ſometime handled fra this place: I remember that in the 6. Heb. 6. it is ſaid, that Apoſtats, they that makis filthie defection, they crucifie the ſonne of God agane, and their falling away, maks thame as guilty as they wer quha crucified him.

Hee is now in the heauens, they cannot gett him out of the heauens to crucifie him, ȝit the Apoſtle ſay is they crucifie him: Quhy? Becauſe their malice is als great as theirs that crucified him, becaus they match in malice with thame that crucified him; ſa that gif they had him in the earth heir, they would doe the like: therefore they are ſaid to crucifie the ſon of GOD: Sicklike in HEB. 10. 29. there is ane vther ſpeach, the wicked are ſayd to ſtramp the blood of chriſt vnder their feet: Quhy? becauſe their malice is als great as theirs that ſtramped his blood: Now, they ar compted for this reaſon to be guilty of the bodie & blood of Chriſt, not becauſe they eat his bodie, but becauſe they refuſe it, quhen they might haue had it. Now the time remaines ȝit, quherein wee may haue the bodie andExhortation blood of Chriſt, this time is very precious, and the diſpenſation of times is very ſecreet, and hes their awin boundes: Gif ȝee take not this time now, it will away. This time of grace, and of that heauenlie foode, hes bene diſpenſed to ȝou very lang, but how ȝee haue profited, ȝour life and behauiour teſtifies: Take vp therefore

ȝour ſelues in time, take ȝour penniworthes of it: for ȝee watt not howe lang it laſts. Craue a mouth to receaue, als wel the food of ȝour ſaull that is offered, as ȝee do the foode of ȝour bodie: and take this time quhile ȝee may haue it, or aſſuredly the time ſall come, quhen ȝee ſall cry for it, and ſall not get it: but in place of grace and mercie, ſall come judgment, vengeance, & the diſpenſation of wrath.
               They will not leaue this mater ſa, butThrid in conuenience they inſiſt ȝit, & they bring ma argumēts to prooue that the wicked are partakers of the bodie and blood of Chriſt. That bread, ſay they, ȝee will grant, quhilk the wicked man eats, is not naked bread, but is that bread, quhilk is the Sacrament: Now they make their argument: the Sacrament hes ever conjoyned with it, the thing ſignified: but the Sacrament is giuen to all, therefore the thing ſignified is giuen to all. Quhat gif I grant to thame all this argument? There ſuld na inconvenient followe: for the thing ſignified may be giuen to all, that is, offered to all, as itRefutation of ths thrid inconvenience. is offered to all men, and ȝit not receaued of all: Giuen to all, therefore receaued of all, it followes not. I may offer ȝou

twa things, ȝit it is in ȝour awin wil, quhither ȝee will take thame or not, but ȝee may take the ane and refuſe the vther, & ȝit hee that offers, offered ȝou the thing that ȝee refuſed, as truely as the thing quhilke ȝee tooke. Sa God deceauis na man nor woman, but with the word and ſacraments, aſſuredly he geuis twa things gif they wald take thame: Into his word, hee offers the word to the eare, he offers Chriſt Ieſus to the ſaull: Into his Sacraments; he offers the Sacraments to the eie, he offers Chriſt Ieſus to the ſaul. Now it may be, that quhere twa things are truly and conjointlie offered, a man may receaue the ane, and refuſe the vther, he receauis the ane becauſe he hes ane inſtrument to take it, hee refuſes the vther becauſe he lacks ane inſtrument: I hear the word, becauſe I haue ane eare to heare it with: I receaue the Sacrament, becauſe I haue a mouth to receaue it with: but as to the thing, quhilk word and Sacament repreſents, I may refuſe it, becauſe I haue not ane mouth to take it, nor ane eie to perceaue it; and therefore the falt is not vpon Gods part, but vpon our part. The wicked gets the bodie & blood of Chriſt

offered to thame conjointlie, with the worde and Sacraments: but the faulte is vpon their parte, they haue not a mouth to take him, and GOD is not bound to giue them a mouth: (Take heed to that) And were not of his ſpeciall grace and mercie, hee geuis me ane eie to perceaue him, and a mouth to receaue him, I wald refuſe him, as weill as they do. Sa this argument dow not, Chriſt is offered to all, ergo, he is receaued of all, happy were they, and they receaued him. This far for the third argument.
               Quhat reſts nowe for the full vnderſtandingHowe the ſaul is ſaid to eat the body and drinke the blood of Chriſt. of the Sacrament? There reſts ȝit ſome things, we man vnderſtand now the ſacramental ſpeaches, that are vſed in the ſacrament: for ȝe ſee, we vſe to ſpeake of thame, God vſes to ſpeake of thame, and the Ancients vſes to ſpeake of tham: Wee vſe to ſay, that the ſaull eats the body of Chriſt, and drinkes the blood of Chriſt. Thir ſpeaches wald be opened vp to ȝou, howe the ſaull is ſaid to eate the bodie, and drinke the blood of Chriſt. Thir ſpeaches are ſacramentall; ȝee are not the wiſer ȝit, but I ſall make it cleare to ȝou, bee Gods grace. They are ſacramentall,

quhat is that? ȝe know it is proper to the bodie to eat and drink, thir ar the proper actiōs of the body only: Now he aſcriues them to the ſaul, be ane tranſlation, be ane figuratiue maner of ſpeaking, that quhilk is proper to the bodie, is aſcriued to the ſaul, and it is ſaid that the ſaull eats and drinks. The eating of the ſaull man reſemble the eating of the body: then the eating of the ſaul is na vther thing, but the applying of Chriſt to the ſaul, to beleue, that he hes ſhed his blood for me, that he hes purchaſed remisſioun of ſinnes to me. Nowe come on, quherefore cal ȝou this ane eating? Quhat cal ȝe the eating of the bodie lat ſee? Eats thou not the bodie, quhen thou applies the meat to thy mouth? Gif then the eating of the bodie bee na vther thing, but the applying of meat to the mouth, the eating of the ſaull mann be na vther thing, but the applying of the nuriture to the ſaull. Then ȝe ſee quhat is meaned be the eating and drinking of the ſaul: Na vther thing, but the applying of Chriſt to my ſaull, and the applying of his death and paſſion to my ſaull, and this is only done be faith: therfore he that lacks faith cannot

eat Chriſt. This far for the eating and drinking of the ſaull, quhilke are ſacramentall ſpeaches.
               Quhat reſts now of al thir great things,Obſeruation. & of al this doctrine that hes bin taught? learne me but this ane leſſon, learne me to apply Chriſt rightlie to thy ſaull, and thou hes win all, thou art a great Theolog, and thou haue learned this weil. For in the right application of Chriſt, to the ſicke ſaull, to the wounded conſcience, & diſeaſed hart; heir beginnes the fountain of all our felicitie, and the welſpring of al our joy. And I ſall tell ȝou, quhat this application workes, looke quhat the preſence of thy ſaull within thee, (ſuppoſe thou want Chriſt in thy ſaull) dois to this earthlie bodie, to this lump of clay, as be the preſence of the ſaul, it liues, it moues, it feiles, as the ſaull giues to the bodie, life, mouing, and ſenſes: that ſame verie thing dois Chriſt to thy ſaull. Hes thou ains gripped and applyed him to thee? As the ſaull quickens the bodie: ſa hee quickens the ſaull, not with an earthly or tēporal life, but with the life quhilk he liues in heuē: he maks the to liue that ſame life quhilk the angels liues in heauen: he

maks the to moue, not with warldly motions, but with heauenly, ſpirituall, & celeſtial motiōs: Again, he inſpyres in thee, not outward ſenſes, but heauenly ſenſes; he warks in thee a ſpirituall feeling, that in thine awin heart and conſcience, thou may find the effect of this word. Swa, be the conjunction of Chriſt with my ſaull; I get a thouſand times a greater benefit, nor the bodie dois bee the ſaull: For the bodie, bee the preſence of the ſaull, gets onlie ane earthly and temporall life, ſubject to continuall miſerie; but be the preſence of Chriſt in my ſaull, I ſee a bleſſed life, I feele a bleſſed life, and that ſame life takes daily, mair and mair increas in me. Then the ground of all our perfection and bleſſednes, ſtands in this conjunction; & ſa, ſuppoſe thou liued METHVSALEMS daies, & were euer crauand: Ȝit, gif in the laſt houre, thou get this conjunction, thou may thinke thy traueill weil wared, thou hes gotten aneugh: Sa ſuld ȝee not bee bisſie in crauing, gif ȝee were to liue a thouſand yeare: for gif ȝe get him in the laſt houre, ȝe haue gotten aneugh: gif ȝee haue gotten Chriſt, ȝee haue gotten all with him: Sa the aplying of Chriſt

to my ſaul, is the fountaine of all my ioy and felicitie.
               And how get we this conjunction, lat ſee? This is a ſpirituall conjunction; a conjunction, hard and difficile to be purchaſed, obtained, and gotten of vs: How then is this conjunction brought about, quhilk ar the moyaners of this cōjunction, vpon the part of God; and quhilk are the moyaners vpō the part of man; to get me Chriſt, to put Chriſt Ieſus in my ſaul, and to make Chriſt Ieſus ane with mee? There is ane moyaner vpon the part of God, that helps to get vs Chriſt; and ther is ane vther vpon our part: vpon the part of GOD, there is the halie ſpirit: quhat doth he? He offers the body and blood of Chriſt to mee. Nowe vppon our part, there mann be a moyaner; or els, ſuppoſe he offer, we will not receaue: Therefore, of necesſitie, there mann bee faith in our ſauls, to receaue that quhilk the halie ſpirit offers, to receaue that heauenlie foode of the bodie and blood of Chriſt, quhilk the halie ſpirit offers. Then faith and the halie ſpirite, are the twa moyaners of this ſpirituall and heauenly conjunction. Be thir twa moyaners; be faith,

and be the halie ſpirit; I get the bodie of Chriſt; the bodie of Chriſt is mine, and he is giuen to my ſaul. Now heere coms in the queſtioun: how can thou ſay, that the bodie of Chriſt, is giuen or deliuered to thee, ſeeing the bodie of Chriſt, is ſittand, at the right hand of God the Father? and looke how great diſtance, is betwixt heauen and earth; als great diſtance is ther, betwixt the body of Chriſt, and thy bodie: how then ſay ȝee, that the bodie of Chriſt is giuen to ȝou? The Papiſtes cannot get this vnderſtoode; and therfore they imagin, ane groſſe and carnall conjunctioun: except the ſpirite of God reueale thir things, they cannot be vnderſtand; the ſpirit of God, mann illuminate our minds, and be bisſie in al our hearts, or we come to the vnderſtanding of this. Then wald thou vnderſtand, how Chriſt is giuen thee? This ground is true, that the bodie of Chriſt, is at the right hand of the Father, the blood of Chriſt, is at the right hand of the father: Ȝit notwithſtanding, ſuppoſe there be als great diſtance, betwixt my bodie, and the body of Chriſt, as is betwixt heauen and earth, Ȝit Chriſts body is giuen to me: and how

is he giuen to me? Be reaſon, I haue ane title of his body giuen to mee: the right and title, quhilk is giuen to me of his bodie and blood, makes mee to poſſeſſe his bodie and bloode: The diſtaunce of the place, hurts not my title, nor my right: For gif ony of ȝou, haue a peece of land, liand in the fardeſt part of Orknay; gif ȝee haue a good title to it; the diſtance of the place cannot hurt ȝour title. Sa I ſay, the diſtance of place, hurts not my title, and my right, that I haue to Chriſt: But ſuppoſe, he be ſitting at the right hand of the Father; ȝit the title and right, that I haue to him, makes him mine; ſa that I may ſay trulie, this man is my propertie: Then Chriſt is not made mine, becauſe I pike him out of the heauens: but hee is mine, becauſe I haue an ſure title & right to him, and hauing a ſure title, and a juſt right to him, the diſtance of place, howe far ſoeuer it be, can on na ways hurt my title, nor my right; but quhaireuer he be, he is mine, becauſe I haue a right and title to him. Ȝea, not onely, haue I a title to him, but this title is confirmed to me: for as I get a title to him in the worde, (and gif I gat not a title to him in the word; I

durſt not come to the Sacrament.) Sa in the Sacrament, I get the confirmation of my title, I get the ſeale quhilk confirmes my title. Then to come to the point: Chriſts bodie is ſittand at the right hand of the Father; and ȝit hee is mine, and is deliuered to me, becauſe I haue right to his bodie, be quhere it will; he was borne for me, giuen to me, and deliuered to me. Swa diſtance of place, hurts not the ſurety of my title, as propinquitie of place, helps not the ſurety of the ſame. I giue thee, that Chriſt wald bow the heauens, and twitch thee with his body, as he did IVDAS: Ȝit this could not helpe thee a quhit; for gif thou had not a title to him, thou durſt not call him thine. Swa it is not the nearenes, nor proximitie of places, that makes Chriſt mine: It is onely the right that I haue to him. I haue right to him, onelie be faith: Sa bee faith onelie, Chriſt is made mine. But they think they haue gotten a great vantage of vs, gif wee bee ſa far fra Chriſt, as the heuen is fra the earth; but that ſal be tane fra tham alſo, be gods grace. I haue a title to his bodie; his bodie is diſtant fra my bodie; ȝit his bodie is not diſtant

fra me; that is, fra my ſaull: I ſay, his bodie, and my ſaull are conjoyned. That is a ſtrange ledder, that will climbe betwixt the heauen and the earth; I get a cordFaith is th
                        •
                      cord that couples vs and Chriſt that gais betwixt the heuen & the earth, that couples mee and him togither; and this is only true faith. Be true faith, chriſt ſuppoſe he be in the heauens, is coupled and conjoyned with mee, quha am heere on earth: How can this be? I ſall ſhew ȝouSimilitude tane fra the ſunne. how: Is not the bodie of the Sunne in the lift? It is imposſible to ȝou, to twitch the bodie of the Sunne; ȝit the bodie of the Sunne and ȝee are conjoyned: howe? Be thay ſame beames that ſhines on ȝou, be that light that ſhines on ȝou: Quhy may not the bodie of Chriſt then, ſuppoſe it be in the heauens, be conjoyned with me that am in the earth, to wit, bee the beams, be the light and gladnes, that flowis fra his bodie? my bodie and the body of Chriſt, are conjoined be the vertue and power that flowis fra his bodie; quhilke vertue and power quickens my dead ſaull, makis mee to liue the life of Chriſt, to begin to die to my ſelfe, and ay the mair I die to my ſelfe, the mair I liue to him. This conjunctioun nowe is the

ground as I tauld ȝou, of all our felicity and happines, and I haue made it clear to ȝou for the preſent, ſa far as God hes ȝit giuen me inſight, gif he geuis ony farther heirafter, as he communicats it, ȝee ſall haue it. Alwaies ȝee ſee this conjunction is moyaned, be twa ſpeciall moyans, be the moyan of the halie ſpirit, and bee the moyan of faith: Gif there bee na vther moyaner, but thir twa, quhy craues thou a carnall or a viſible conjunctioun? Faith is inviſible, and the ſpirit is inuiſible: therefore thou cannot ſee it nor tak it vp with the eie of thy bodie, the power of the halie ſpirit is ſa ſubtill, ſecreet, and inviſible, that thou cannot perceaue it, nor take it vp with the eie of thy bodie, and he wil work great effects in thy ſaul, or ever thou take vp his working. In reſpect therefore, that the moyaners of this conjunctioun are ſa ſubtill, ſecreet, & ſpiritual, quhy thinks thou to get a ſight of this conjunctioun with the eie of thy bodie? Quhy imagins thou ſick a carnall conjunction, as this quhilk wald not do thee good, ſuppoſe thou had it? Knawis thou not that the ſpirit, that cowples vs and Chriſt is infinite, ſa that it is als eaſie

to the ſpirit, to couple Chriſt and vs, how far diſtant that ever wee be, as it is eaſie to our ſaull to cowple our head, and the feet of our body, ſuppoſe they be diſtant. Then, ſeing this conjunctiō is the ground and fountaine, of all our happines, and ſeeing this ground of happines is ſa ſubtill, and ſa ſpirituall, quhat is ȝour parte?
                     
                        •
                     xhortation Remooue all ȝour outward ſenſes: Remooue al ȝour natural motions, remoue ȝour naturall diſcourſes, and ȝour naturall reaſon, and followe the ſight and informatioun of the ſpirit of God: Craue that it wald pleaſe him to illuminat ȝour vnderſtanding, that bee the light of his ſpirit, ȝe may ſe cleirly the ſpirituall conjunctioun. Except the eie of the ſpirit be giuen ȝou to take vp this ſpirituall conjunctioun: It is not posſible that ȝee can get any inſight in it. But will the Lord of his mercy beſtowe ſome meaſure of his halie ſpirit vpon ȝou, out of queſtion, ȝe ſall ſone come to the vnderſtanding of it, & ȝe ſall thinke the time happy, that ever ȝe heard this word. Except ȝe haue ſome parte of this ſpirit, it is not posſible that ȝee can be ſpirituall: that quhilk is born of fleſh and blood, man remane fleſh and

blood, except the ſpirit come in & make it ſpirituall: therefore ȝee man be borne agane of the ſpirit, ȝee man be borne in the bodie of Chriſt, his ſpirit man quicken ȝou. This is called the quickening and liuing ſpirit of Chriſt bee IOHN, & ſa ſone as this ſpirit coms in vs, quhat dois it? It chaſes away darkenes out of the vnderſtanding: quhereas before I knewe not God, now I ſee him not onely generallie, that hee is a God, but that hee is a God in Chriſt. Quhat mair dois the halie ſpirit? He opins the hart as wel as the mind: & quhat dois hee there? That ſame thing quherevpon I beſtowed the affectioun of my hart, and imployed the loue of my ſaull, is be the working of the halie ſpirit made gaull to me, he maks it vennome to me, and to bee as deadlie hated of me, as poyſon. He workes ſick ane inward diſpoſition in my ſaull, that hee maks me to turne & flie from that ſame thing, quhervpon I imployed my loue of before, and to imploy it vpon God. (this is a greate perfectioun) Alwaies in ſome meaſure, he maks me to loue God, better then any vther thing: hee changes the affections of my ſaull, hee changes the faculties, and

qualities of my ſaull, and ſuppoſe our hartes and mindes be made newe, ȝit the ſubſtance of thame is not changed, but only the faculties and qualities are changed, in reſpect of the quhilk change, wee are called new creatures, and except ȝee be found newe creatures, ȝee are not in Chriſt.
               
                  Concluſion with ane exhortation,Now to come to the point, this ſecret conjunction is brought about be fayth, and be the halie ſpirit; be faith wee gripp the body & blood of Chriſt: and ſuppoſe wee be als far diſtant, as Heauen & earth ar, the ſpirit ſerues vs as a ledder to conjoyn vs with Chriſt: As the ledder of IACOB, quhilk reached fra the grounde to the Heauen, to the ſelfe ſame vſe ſerues the ſpirit of God, to conjoyne the bodie of Chriſt with my ſaull. Then take vp all in a word: quhat maks ȝou to haue ony right, or title to Chriſt? Nathing but the ſpirit, nathing but faith: Quhat ſuld bee ȝour ſtudie then? Preaſe be al means poſſible to get faith, that as PET. Act. 15. 9. ſaies, ȝour harts and conſciences may be ſanctified be faith. And gif ȝee preaſe not as weill to get faith in ȝour hartes, as in ȝour minds, ȝour faith avails not. Quhat

avails the faith, that fleets in the fantaſie, and brings a naked knawledge, without the opening of the hart, and conſent of the will; Swa thair man be ane opening▪ of thy heart, and ane conſent of thy will, to doe that thing that GOD bids doe, or thy faith availes not. Then preaſe to get faith in ȝour harts and minds, and doing ſa, ȝee do the dutie of Chriſtians. This is not done without the diligēt hering of the word, and diligent perception of the Sacraments. Sa, bee diligent in thir excerciſes, and be diligent in prayer: Praying in the halie Ghaiſt, that he wald nuriſh ȝour ſaules inwardly, with the bodie and blood of Chriſt, that he wald increaſe faith in ȝour hartes and mindes, & make it to grow vp mair and mair daily, quhill ȝe come to the ful fruition of that bleſſed immortalitie. Vnto the quhilk, the Lord of his mercie bring vs, and that for the righteous merits of Chriſt Ieſus. To quhome with the Father and the halie Ghaiſt, be all honor, praiſe, and glory, for nowe and ever
               Amen.
            
            
               
               THE THIRD SERMON, VPON THE LORDS SVPper, preached the 15. of February, 1589.
               
                  
                     1. COR. 11. 23.
For I haue receiued of the Lord, that which I alſo haue deliuered vnto ȝou, to wit, that the Lord Ieſus in the night that hee was betraied, tooke bread: &c.
               
               
                  WE heard (welbeloued in Chriſt Ieſus) in our laſt leſſoun, quhat names was giuen to the Sacrament of the Supper, als wel in the book of God, as bee the Auncients of the Latine and Orient Kirks. Wee heard the cheife ends, quherefore, and quherevnto this haly Sacrament was inſtituted. We heard the things that were contained into this ſacrament, quhat they war, how

they are coupled, how they ar deliuered▪ and how they are receaued. Wee heard alſo ſome objections, that might bee caſten in the contrair of this doctrine: wee hard thame proponed, and as God gaue the grace, refuted. And laſt of all, we hard how the faithful ſaul, is ſaid to eat Chriſt his bodie, and to drink his blood: Wee heard the maner how Chriſt is, or can be receaued of vs: And we concluded in this point; that Chriſt Ieſus, the Sauiour of mankind, our Sauiour, cannot be perceaued, nor ȝit receaued, but bee a ſpirituall way and apprehenſion; nather the fleſhe of Chriſt, nor the bloode of Chriſt, nor Chriſt himſelfe; can be perceaued, but be the eie of faith; can bee receaued, but bee the mouth of faith, nor can be gripped, but be the hand of faith. Nowe faith is a ſpirituall thing: for faith is the gift of GOD, powred downe in the hearts and mindes of men and women, wrought in the ſaull of euery ane, and that bee the mightie working, and operatioun of the halie ſpirite. Sa, the onely way to grippe Chriſt beeing bee faith: and faith of the awin nature beeing ſpirituall; it folowes therefore, that there is not a way to get

a grippe of Chriſt, but ane ſpirituall way▪ There is not a hand to grippe Chriſt, but ane ſpirituall hand, there is not a mouth to digeſt Chriſt, but ane ſpiritual mouth. The ſcriptures familiarly be al thir terms, points out the nature & efficacie of faith.
               Wee are ſaide to eat the fleſh of ChriſtHow we are ſaide to eat the fleſhe & drinke the blood of Chriſt. be faith, and to drinke his blood be faith in this Sacrament, cheifly in doing of twa thinges. Firſt, in calling to our remembrance, the bitter death and pasſioun of Chriſt, the blood that hee ſhed vpon the Croſſe, the Supper quhilk hee inſtituted in remembrance of him, before hee gaid to the Cros. The commandement quhilk he gaue: Do this in remembrance of me: I ſay, we eat his fleſh, & drinks his bloodſpiritually. Firſt, in this point, in recording and remembring faithfully, how he died for vs, howe his blood was ſhed vpon the Croſſe. This is the firſt point; a point that cannot be remembred trulie, except it be wrought be the mighty power of the halie ſpirit. The ſecond point of the ſpirituall eating, ſtands in this; that I, and euery ane of ȝou, beleeue firmlie, that he died for me in particuler: That his blood was ſhed on the Croſſe, for a full remisſioun

and redemptioun of mee, and my ſinnes▪ the cheife and principall point of the eating of Chriſt his fleſhe, and drinking of his blood; ſtandes in beleeuing firmlie, that that fleſh was deliuered to death for my ſins, that that blood of his, was ſhed for the remisſioun of my ſinnes: and except euerie ſaull come neere to him ſelfe, and firmly conſent, agree, and be perſwaded that Chriſt died for him, that ſaull cannot be ſaued; that ſaull cannot eat the fleſh, nor drink the blood of Chriſt. Then the eating of the fleſhe, and drinking of the blood of Chriſt; ſtands in ane faithfull memorie, in ane firme beleife, and in ane true applying of the merites of the death and pasſioun of Chriſt to my awin conſcience in particular.
               There was ſundrie things objected againſt this kind of perception; and I will not inſiſt to repeat thame, but beſide all the objections, quhilk ȝee heard objected againſt this kinde of ſpirituall perceptioun bee faith: They ſay, gif Chriſt his fleſhe, nor his bloode, bee not perceaued, nor receaued but be the ſpirit; bee faith in the ſpirite, then ſay they, ȝee receaue him but be ane imagination.

Gif he be not receaued carnally, nor corporally, but onely bee the ſpirite, and bee faith: then is he not receaued, but be way of imagination, conceat, and fantaſie. Sa they count faith, ane imagination of the mind, ane fantaſie and opinion, fleeing in the harnes of man. I cannot wite thame to think ſa of faith: for as nane can judge of the ſweetnes ofhony, but they that hes taiſted of it: Sa, there is nane can diſcerne nor judge vppon the nature of faith, but they that hes felt, & taiſted in their harts quhat it is. And gif they had taiſted and felt in their ſauls, quhat faith brings with it; alace, they wald not call that ſpirituall iewell, and onelie iewel of the ſaul, ane imaginatioun; they call it ane imagination, and the Apoſtle deſcriuing it HEB. 11 1. cals it ane ſubſtance, and ane ſubſtantiall ground: Looke howe weill thir twa agrees, an imagination, and ane ſubſtantiall ground; they call it ane vncertaine opinioun, fleeting in the braine and fantaſie of man: He cals it ane euidencie and demonſtration in the ſame definition. See howe plat contrary, the Apoſtle and they are in the nature of faith. Vpon this, they inferre, that as it is true in the generall,

hee cannot bee deliuered nor giuen, but that ſame way that hee is receaued; and looke quhat way, any thing is receaued, that ſame way it is giuen & deliuered: ſa efter thame, he being receaued be way of imagination, hee is alſo in their fantaſie giuen and deliuered, be way of imagination. For gif he be not giuen, ſay they, to thy hand, to thy mouth, nor to thy ſtomach corporall; hee cannot be giuen, but be ane imaginatioun, and fantaſtical opinion. The reaſoun that mouis thame to thinke, that Chriſt cannot be theirs, nor giuen to thame truly, in effect and really, except he be giuen carnally, is this: that thing quhilk is ſa far abſent, and ſa far diſtant fra vs: as the heuen is fra the earth; cannot be ſaid, to be giuen to vs, nor to be ours: But with ȝour awin confesſion, ſay they to vs, Chriſt his bodie, is als far abſent from vs, as the heauen is from the earth: therefore Chriſt his bodie, nor his fleſh, cannot bee giuen to vs, except bee way of imaginatioun, and ſo not truelie nor in effect. This argument framed in this ſort, wald appear to haue ſome force, and moment in the entrie: Ȝit let vs examine the propoſition of it. The propoſition

is this: that thing quhilk is ſo far abſent from vs, as the Heauen is from the Earth; cannot be ſaid to be deliuered to vs, to bee giuen to vs, or any way to bee ours. Now quhither is this propoſitioun true or fals? I ſay this propoſition is flat fals, and the contrair is maiſt true; a thing may be giuen to vs, & may become ours, ſuppoſe the thing in perſon it ſelfe be as far diſtant from vs, as the heauen is from the earth. And how proue I this? Quhat maks ony thing to be ȝours? Quhat makis ony of ȝou to count a thing to be giuen to ȝou? Is it not a title, is it not a juſt right to that thing? And gif ȝee haue as juſt right giuen vnto ȝou, bee him, quha hes power to giue it, and ane ſure title made to ȝou, be him, quha hes the power: ſuppoſe the thing that he geuis ȝou, be not deliuered into ȝour hand, ȝit bee the right and title, quhilk hee makis to ȝou, is not the thing ȝours? This is out of queſtioun, for it is not the nearnes of the thing to my bodie and to my hand, that makes the thing mine: for it may bee in my hand, and ȝit not appertaine to me; Nather is it the diſtance, nor abſence of the thing that makes it not to bee mine,

but it may be far abſent from me, & ȝit be mine; becauſe the title is mine, and becauſe I haue gotten a right to it, of him quha hes power to giue it. Sa this ground is true, it is a ſure title, and an juſt right, that makis a thing, ſuppoſe it bee far abſent and diſtant fra vs, to bee ours. Now ſubſume: But ſa it is, that a liuely & true fayth, in the blood and death of Chriſt, makes vs to haue ane ſure title, and ane good right to the fleſh & blood of Chriſt, and to his merites, looke quhat he merited be his death, & ſheding of his blood vpon the cros, al that, togither with himſelfe alſo, apperteins to me, and that be a title & ane right, quhilk I haue gotten to him of God, quhilk is faith: And the ſurer that my title be, the mair ſure am I of the thing, that is giuen me be the title. Now this Sacrament of the Supper wes inſtituted to confirme our title, to ſeale vp our right, quhilk wee haue to the bodie and blood, to the death & pasſioun of Chriſt, and ſa the bodie of Chriſt is ſaid to bee giuen to vs: the blood of Chriſt is ſaid to be deliuered to vs, quhen our title, quhilk we haue of him, of his death, of his body and blood, is confirmed in our hartes▪ for

this Sacrament wes inſtituted, for the growth and increaſe of our faith, for the increaſe of halines and ſanctificatioun; quhilk faith, the greater that it be in our hartes, the mair ſure are wee, that Chriſt his death apertains to vs. I grant to thee, as I haue ſaide, that the fleſh of Chriſt, is not deliuered in my hand, his fleſh is not put in my mouth, nor enters not in my ſtomach: Ȝit, God forbid, that thou ſay, he is not truly giuen. For ſuppoſe Chriſts fleſh bee not put in thy hand, nor mouth of thy bodie (and quherefore ſuld it? Hes he not appointed bread and wine for the nuriture of the body, and may they not content ȝou? are they not ſufficient to nuriſh ȝou to this earthly and temporall life? hee hes appointed Chriſt to be deliuered, to the inward mouth of the ſaull, to be giuen in the hand of thy ſaule, that thy ſaull may feed on him, and be quickned with that life, quherewith the Angels liues, quhairwith the Son of God, and God himſelfe liues: Sa the fleſh of Chriſt, is not appointed to nuriſh thy body, but to nuriſh thy ſaul in the hope, ȝea in the growth of that immortall life) And therefore I ſay; ſuppoſe the fleſh of Chriſt

be not deliuered in the hand of my body; ȝit it is deliuered to the part that it ſuld nuriſh; the ſaull is the part that it ſuld nuriſh: Therefore to the ſaul it is deliuered: ȝea that bread, & that wine, are na mair really deliuered to the body, and to the hand of the body; nor the fleſh of Chriſt, is deliuered to the ſaul, & to the hand & mouth of the ſaul, quhilk is faith. Therefore, craue na mair a carnal deliuerie, nor panſe not vpon an carnal receuing. Thou man not think, that ather God giues the fleſh of Chriſt, to the mouth of the body, or that thou, be the mouth of thy bodie, receauis the fleſh of Chriſt. For ȝee man vnderſtād this principal in the Scriptures of God; our ſaull cannot bee ioyned, nor bound with the fleſhe of Chriſt, nor the fleſh of Chriſt cannot be ioyned with our ſaull, but be ane ſpirituall band; not by ane carnall band of blood or allya, nor bee the twitching of his fleſhe, with our fleſh. But he is conjoyned with vs, be ane ſpirituall band; that is, bee the power and vertue of his halie ſpirit: And therefore the Apoſtle ſayis, 1. COR. 12. 13. that be the moyan of his halie ſpirite; all wee quha are faithfull men and women,

are baptized in one bodie of Chriſt; that is, we are conjoyned, and faſtned vp with ane Chriſt, bee the moyan (ſayis hee) of ane ſpirite; not bee ane carnall band, or be ane groſſe conjunction; but anelie be the band of the halie ſpirite; that ſame halie ſpirit that is in him, is in every ane of vs in ſome meſure: And in reſpect ane ſpirit is in him, and in vs: Therefore wee are counted al to be ane body, and to be members of ane ſpirituall, and myſticall bodie: and in that ſame vers he ſayis; We are all made to drinke in ane, and the ſelfe ſame ſpirit, that is: Wee are made to drinke of the blood of Chriſt, and this blood is na vther thing, but the quickening vertue & power that flows fra chriſt and fra the merites of his death. We are made all to drinke of that blood, quhen wee drinke of the liuely power and vertue that flows out of that blood: Sa there is not a bande, that can couple my ſaull with the fleſh of Chriſt, but anely a ſpirituall band, and ane ſpirituall vnioun; & therefore it is that the Apoſtle 1. COR. 6. 17. ſayis: Hee that is cowpled with God, and conjoyned with our Lord, is ane ſpirit with him, and IOHN, in his third chap.

ſayis: That quhilk is borne of the ſpirit, is ſpirit: Sa it is onelie, be the participation of the halie ſpirite, that wee are conjoyned with the fleſh and blood of Chriſt Ieſus; that carnall band, quhither it bee the band of bloode, running thorowe ea race; or bee the carnal twitching of fleſh with fleſhe: that carnall band, was neuer eſteemed off be Chriſt, in the time he was conuerſant heere vpon earth, hee lute nathing of that band; and as he hes left behind him in his booke; he had neuer that carnal band, in ony kind of reuerence nor eſtimation, in reſpect of the ſpirituall band: but as to the ſpiritual band, quhairby we are coupled with him be an ſpirite; he euer eſteemed of this band, in the time that hee was conuerſant in the warld: and in his booke, hee hes left the praiſe and commendation of the ſpirituall band. To lat ȝou ſee, how lightly hee eſtemed of the carnal band, of the blood and alya, quhilk we regard ſa meekle. Ȝee haue a place, LVKE. 8. 20. 21. for there they come to him, and they ſay, Maiſter, ȝour mother, ȝour brother and kinsfolks ſtands without, and wald ſee ȝou, and bee at ȝou: ȝee heare his anſwere to their demand;

how litle hee eſteemes of that carnall band, he anſwers in the 21. verſe, in a maner, denying that band, and he ſayis: They are my mother and brethren, quha heares the word of GOD and dois it: as gif he wald ſay; it is not that carnall band that I eſteme off, it is not that carnal conjunctioun that I reuerence; it is the ſpirituall conjunction, be the participation of the halie ſpirit, quhairby wee are moued to hear the worde of God, to giue reuerence to it, and to obey it. This carnall band, was neuer profitable as that ſame, LVK. 8. dois plainly teſtifie: For gif the twitching of Chriſts fleſh had bene profitable, the multitude quhair of mention is made in that chapter, that thruſted and preaſed him, had bene the better be their carnal twiching: but ſa it is, that ther was neuer ane of tham the better of their carnal twitching: Therefore the carnal twitching profits na thing. Sayis hee not him ſelfe, IOH. 6. to draw tham from that ſiniſter cōfidence, that they had into his fleſh onely; my fleſh profits nathing, it is onely the ſpirite that quickens; as to the vther twitching, to twitch him be the haly ſpirit, & be faith in thy ſaull: this twitching

be faith hes ever bin profitable: and wee haue a plain exāple of it in the ſam chap. Sicklike, quhair there the poore woman that was lang diſeaſed with ane bloodie iſſue, be the ſpace of twelue yeares, and had waſted, and conſumed ane great part of hir ſubſtance, in ſeeking remeid, ſhee findis no helpe at the naturall and bodelie Phyſition: At laſt, be the vertue of the halie ſpirit, working faith in her hart; be faith ſhe vnderſtands and conceuis, that ſhee is able to recouer the health of her bodie, & the health of her ſaull at Chriſt Ieſus, quha come to ſaue baith bodie & ſaull: and vpon this perſwaſioun quhilk ſho hes in her hart, that Chriſt may cure both bodie and ſaull, ſhee comes to him, and as the text ſayis, ſho preaſis thorowe the multitude, quhill ſhe come to him, & quhen ſho comes to him, it is not ſaide that ſho twitched his fleſh with hir hand; in cace the Papiſtes wald aſcriue the vertue quhilk come out of him, to her carnal twitching: But it is ſaid, that ſho twitched onely the hemme of his garment with her hand, and with faith, quhilk is the hand of the ſaull, ſhe twitched her ſauiour God and man. And to lat ȝou vnderſtand,

that ſho twitched him be faith, he ſais to her in the end: Go thy way, thy faith hath ſaued thee, ſho twitched him not ſo ſoone bee fayth, but incontinent there comes a power out of him, quhilke power and vertue, ſho felt be the effect of it in her ſaull, and he felt it quhen it gaid fra him: The effect quhairby ſho felt it, was the health of hir faull, and the effect quhairby hee felt it, was the ganging fra him, and ſa ſoone as he felt it ga fra him, he ſayis, quha is this that hath twitched me? PETER, quho was ever maiſt ſudden, anſwers, and ſayis: Thou art thrumbled and thruſted be the multitude, and ȝit thou ſpeeris quha hes twitched thee, hee anſwers againe and he ſayis, it is not that twitching that I ſpeak of: It is ane vther kinde of twitching: There is ane hes twitched me, quha hes drawin a vertue and power out of me. The multitude taks na vertue fra me: The poore Woman thinking that ſhe had done amiſſe, and ſeeing that ſho could not be hid, ſho coms trimbling, and ſho ſayis; I haue done it: he anſwers her in the end; and he ſayis, depart in peace, thy faith hes ſaued the, thy faith hes thrawin out a vertue and power out

of me, that hath made baith ſaul and bodie haill. Sa that this twitching of Chriſt hes ever bene profitable, is and ſall bee profitable. Lik as the twitching of Chriſt with the corporall hand, hes neuer bene, is not, nor ſall never bee profitable; for quhy? Chriſt is not appointed to bee a carnall head, to bee ſet vppon the crags of our bodies, that hee may doe the office of a carnal head thairvnto, to furniſh naturall motioun, and ſenſes to our bodie, na, the ſcriptures cals not Chriſt ane carnall head: But the ſcriptures cals him an ſpirituall head, to be ſet on the crag of ourſaul, that is, to be conjoyned with our ſaull, that out of him in our ſaull, may diſtil haly motions, heauenly ſenſes, & that there may flow out of him to vs, ane ſpirituall and heauenly life. Then the Scriptures cals him ane ſpirituall head, as they call vs ane ſpirituall bodie. And as the life, quhilk we get from him, is ſpirituall: Sa all our conjunction with him, is ſpirituall; and in reſpect, hee works that ſame operattion in my ſaull, quhilk the carnal head dois in the bodie: Therefore hee is counted a ſpirituall head; Therefore is he counted the head of his Kirk, bee reaſon

he furniſhes to hir, ſpirituall motion and ſenſes, quhilk is the life of the Kirk: Sa to be ſhort, there is nathing in this conjunctioun carnall; there is nathing groſſe in it, there is nathing, that may be compaſt bee our naturall iudgement and vnderſtanding: And therfore, quhaſoeuer wald attaine, to ony ſmall inſight of this ſpiritul conjunction, betwixt vs and Chriſt; of force he mann bow downe, and earneſtly incall for the ſpirit, or it is not posſible to get ony vnderſtanding, and it were neuer ſa ſmal ane inſight; how the fleſh of Chriſt and wee are conjoyned, except wee haue ſome light giuen vs bee the ſpirit: that is, except our heartes bee walkned, bee the mightie working of the ſpirite of Chriſt, this ſall remaine, as a dead and a cloſedExhortation letter to vs. Sa ȝee haue to craue, that the Lord in his mercie, wald walken ȝou, and illuminat ȝour vnderſtandings, and mak ȝou to haue a ſpirituall light, to diſcerne on thir ſpirituall things. Nixt, ȝee mann ſtudie and be cairfull to remooue all vain cogitations, and earthly fantaſies, quhen ȝe enter to heare of ſick ane high mater; ȝee mann caſt off all filthy thoughtes, ill motions, and cairs of the warld; and ȝee

man ſhake off all things that cloggs ȝour hartes: And thirdlie, ȝee man come with a purpoſe to hear the worde, to giue diligent▪ear to the worde, and with a ſanctified harte to receaue it, with ane purpoſe to grow & increaſe in halines, as weill in bodie, as in ſaul, all the daies of ȝour life: And comming with this purpoſe, na queſtion, the halie ſpirit ſal reueal the things to ȝou that ȝee want. And ſuppoſe this word paſſe, and bring not great commoditie for the preſent, ȝit the halie ſpirite hereafter, ſal reueale to thee, the truth of that quhilk thou hes heard nowe. Then this is the point of all, be preſent in ȝour hartes and mindes, and lat ȝour ſauls be emptied of al the cares of the world, that they may receaue that liquour, quhilk is offered in the hearing of this word.
               Now I go forward, and I come to the diſcriuing of the ſacramēt of the ſupper,The definition of the ſacrament of the Lords Supper. and I call this Sacrament of the Supper, ane halie ſeale, annexed to the couenant of grace and mercie in Chriſt, a ſeale to be miniſtred publikly, according alwayis to the halie inſtitutioun of Chriſt Ieſus, that be the lawful miniſterie thereof, the Sacramentall vnioun betwixt the ſignes,

and the thing ſignified may ſtande, and this vnion ſtanding, Chriſt Ieſus, quha is the thing ſignified, is als trulie deliuered to the increaſe of our nuriture ſpiritual, as the ſignes are giuen and deliuered to the bodie, to the nuriture temporall. Nowe wee ſall examine the wordes, and partes of this definition. Firſt of all, I callQuhy th

                     led a ſeale. this Sacrament a ſeale, bee reaſoun that this Sacrament ſerues to the ſame vſe to our ſaulls, that a common ſeale ſerues to a common evident: As the ſeall quhilk is annexed to the evident, confirmes and ſeals vp the truth conteined in the evident: Sa this Sacrament of the bodie and blood of Chriſt, confirmes and ſeals vpp the truth of mercie and grace, conteined in the couenant of mercie and grace: for this reſpect it is called a ſeall: It is calledQuhy it is called a haly ſeale. a halie ſeall, quhy? Becauſe it is tane fra the prophane vſe, quherevnto that bread ſerued in the night before, & that bread is applied to ane halie vſe: there is a power giuen to that bread, to ſignifie the precious bodie of Chriſt Ieſus, to repreſent the nuriture & feeding of our ſauls: And in reſpect, it ſerues now in the ſacrament to ſa halie ane vſe, therefore I call

it ane halie ſeal. As to this word, it is not mine, it is the Apoſtles word. ROM. 4. 11. quhere he geuis the Sacrament the ſame name, and calls it a ſeall. And to tell ȝou farther, gif the wiſdome of Chriſt in his Apoſtle, had bene followed, and gif men had not inuēted new names of their awn to this Sacrament: but contented and ſatisfied thame ſelfes, with the names that God hes giuen bee his Apoſtle, and that Chriſt himſelfe had giuen to this Sacrament; I am aſſured, nane of thir tragedies nor great ſtormes and debaites (quhilk neuer wil ceaſe) had fallen out: but quher men will ga about, to bee wiſer nor God, and ga beyond God, in deuiſing names, quhilk hee hes neuer giuen; vppon mens awin inuentions, ſicke tragedies and debaits hes fallen out. A leſſon be the way; lat na fleſh preſume to be wiſer nor God, but lat tham ſtoup, and keepe the namesQuhy the ſeal is ſaid to be annexed to the covenaut, quhilk God hes giuen to this ſacrament. I ſay thirdly, annexed to the couenaunt, annexed and hung to the chartour: becauſe it cannot bee called a ſeale properlie, except it be hunging at ane euident. Looke quhat it is bee nature, that ſame thing is it, and na farther; gif it bee not

hungin to ſome euident, it is only the appenſioun to the euident, that makes men to count it ane ſeale: therefore it is nathing eſteemed, but being hung to the euident. Euin ſa it is heere, gif that Sacrament be not miniſtred and hungin to the preached word; to the preaching of the couenant of mercy & grace, it cannot be a ſeale; but looke quhat it is be nature, it is na mair: as be nature, it is but a commoun peece bread, ſa it is na mair; gif it bee not hungin to the preaching of the word, and miniſtred therewith as Chriſt hes commanded: Therefore I ſay, the ſeal mann be annexed appended and hungin to the evident, to the preaching of the worde for eſtabliſhing of the evident, vtherwaies it is not a ſeall. But it is not ſa with the evident, quhilk is the worde of God: for ȝee know ony evident will mak faith, ſuppoſe it want a ſeall, and it will ſerue to make a right, gif it be ſubſcriued without a ſeall: but the ſeall without the evident avails nathing: Euen ſa it is with the worde of God, ſuppoſe the Sacraments be not annexed to the worde, ȝit the worde will do our turne, it ſerues vs to get Chriſt; It ſerues to ingender & beget

faith in vs, and maks vs to grow vp in faith: but the ſeale without the word, can ſerue vs to na halie vſe: therfore I ſay, the ſeal man be annexed to the worde preached, to the couenant of mercie & grace.
               Now there followes in the definition,Quhy the Sacrament, ſuld be miniſtred publicklie. that this ſeale mann be miniſtred publiklie: Quherfore ſay I publiklie? to exclude all priuate adminiſtratioun of this Sacrament: For gif this Sacrament bee miniſtredFirſt reaſon to an priuatly, it is not a ſacrament; quhy? Becauſe the Apoſtle cals this Sacrament a communion; Miniſter ȝee it to ane, ȝee tine the communion: Therefore, gif ȝee miniſter it priuatlie, ȝe tine the ſacrament: For this Sacrament, is a communion of the bodie & blood of Chriſt; therefore, of force it mann bee, be way of communication, and ſa the action mannSecond reſon be publiklie miniſtred. Secondly, this Sacrament mann bee publiklie miniſtred; quhy? Becauſe Chriſt Ieſus, quha is the thing ſignified in this Sacrament, is not ſick a thing as pertenis to ane man anely; gif it were ſa, hee might bee priuatlie giuen and miniſtred: But ſeeing Chriſt, quhilk is the thing ſignified in the Sacrament, is a common thing, appertaining

to euerie faithfull man and woman: therfore, he aught to be commonlie giuen to all, in a common action; in a ſocietie and congregatioun of the faithfull. Thirdly, this Sacrament is compted a thankesgiuing to God the Father for his benefits: Now it appertains not to ane or twa, to thanke God onelie; but as we are all partakers of his temporall and ſpirituall benefits: ſa we aught all publiklie, to giue him thanks for the ſame. Therefore I ſay, in the definitioun, this ſeale aught to bee publicklie, and not priuatlie miniſtred, as the Papiſts dois in their priuate Meſſe. This ſeale mann bee publiklie miniſtred, according to Chriſts inſtitution: quherefore ſay I, Chriſts inſtitutioun mair, norQuhy this ſeal man be miniſtred according to Chriſts inſtitution▪

I ſall tell ȝou quhy; becauſe, a man hes not power, to inſtitute or make a Sacrament; becauſe an Angel hes not power to make or inſtitute a Sacrament: For nane hes power to make nor inſtitute a Sacrament, but he that hes power to giue Chriſt, quha is the thing ſignified in the Sacrament: But ſa it is, that nane hes power to giue Chriſt, but ather the Father

or himſelfe: therfore nane hes power

There is na Prince in the earth will be content, to be ſerued efter ane vther mans fanteſie: but hee will preſcriue his ſeruice, according vnto his awin fantaſie: Howe meekle mair is it meet, that God ſuld appoint his awin ſeruice and worſhipping: Therefore there is nather man nor Angell, hes power to inſtitute a part of the ſeruice of God; the ſacraments are ane part of his ſeruice; therfore, there is na Angel nor man, hes power to inſtitute a Sacramenr. The greateſt ſtyle, that ony man in the earth gets in the Miniſterie of the woorde and Sacramentes, is that ſtyle, quhilk the Apoſtle giues thame. 1. COR. 1. 4. There wee are called Stewardes, and diſpenſours of the graces of God; Miniſters of thay myſteries

and halie things. It followes then of this, that wee are not Authours, Creators, or makers of thame; but onely Miniſters and diſpenſers of the Sacraments. Swa it is cleare, that na man, nor creature hes power to make a Sacrament: Then it mann bee according to the inſtitution of Chriſt; his inſtitution mann bee keeped: Looke quhat he ſaid, looke quhat he did, looke quhat he commanded thee to do: all that, mann be ſaid, done, and obeyed: Leaue thou a iote of that vndone, quhilk hee commaunded thee to doe, thou peruerts the inſtitution: for there is nathing left in regiſter of that inſtitution, but it is eſſentiall. Sa, in the celebration of Chriſts inſtitution, we mann take tent, to quhatſoeuer he ſaid, did, or commanded to be done: thou mann firſt ſay, quhatſoeuer he ſaid; and then do, quhatſoeuer he did; For the miniſterie of the Sacrament, man follow efter the worde. Firſt thou mann ſay, that quhilk Chriſt commanded thee to ſay, and thou man teach, that quhilk hee commanded thee to teach, and thenWe call the word in the ſacrament, the haill inſtitution. miniſter the Sacrament. Then to keepe this inſtitution, we man begin at the ſaying, & ſay, quhatſoeuer Chriſt commanded

vs, thaireſter faithfullie doe all that quhilk he commanded to be done. Swa, quhat call we the word? I call the word, the haill inſtitution of Chriſt Ieſus, preached and proclaimed, denounced diſtinctlie, clearlie, and ſenſiblie to the people: In ſick ſort, that gif we leaue ony kind of circumſtance or ceremonie of this inſtitution vndone, wee peruert the haill action.
               It is agreed & condiſcended vpon, betwixt vs, quha celebrats this inſtitutiounWord and element man continue to the conſtitution of a Sacrament. and all the ſects of this warld, quha hes ſeparat thame ſelues fra this inſtitution, that twa things are neceſſare, and mann concur to the nature and conſtitution of a ſacrament; to wit, there man be a word, and there man bee ane element concurrand; there is not a ſect, but they graunt this, that the worde man concurre with the element, or wee get a Sacrament. As they are eaſie to admit this generall, look how eaſie they are to admit this general, and howe weill wee agree with thame in the generall, quhen it comes to the ſpeciall, and that wee enter into particular in the handling & treating of the word, looke how weil we agree in the generall,

in the particuler we loope als far ſundry: For quhen wee come to diſpute, & reaſon on thir particulers; firſt, quhat wee mean be the word: Secondlie, howe this word ought to bee intreated: Thirdlie, quhat vertue this worde hes: Fourthlie, howe farr the vertue of this worde dois extend the ſelfe: and laſt of all, to quhome the words ought to be directed & pronounced: In all thir particulers, wee are als far ſundrie, as ever wee appeared to agree in the generall.
               I leaue my conference with any vtherQuhat wee vnderſtand be the word in the Sacrament. ſect, and halde me with the Papiſtes, becauſe wee haue maiſt adoe with thame. And firſt of all wee haue to vnderſtande, quhat wee mean be the word, and quhat they meane be it: wee be the worde, as I haue ſaid, vnderſtands the haill inſtitution of Chriſt Ieſus, quhatſoeuer hee ſaid, quhatſoeuer hee did, or commanded to be done, without eiking, without paring, without alteratioun of the meaning or ſens of the word: This wee mean bee the worde in the Sacrament. Quhat vnderſtands the Papiſtes bee the worde? They preach not the inſtitution of Chriſt, nor taks not the haill inſtitution, as he left it:

but in ſtead thereof they ſelect, and pyksQuhat the papiſts vnderſtande be the word in the Sacrament. out of his inſtitution, four or fiue words; and they make the haill vertue of the inſtitutioun, to ſtand in the foure or fiue words: & it maid noght gif they contented thame with they words, becauſe they are the words of the inſtitution: but they eike to they wordes, they paire fra the wordes and alters, the meaning of they ſame wordes, quhilk they keepe as they pleas. That ȝee may ken this; In their Meſſe quhilk they cal the Supper, wee ſal lat ȝou ſe the ſubſtance of it. I deuide the Meſſe in ſubſtantiall things, and accidentall things: To the ſubſtance of the Meſſe there ar three things craued. There man of force be a preiſt, that is ſick a ane, as taks vpon him the office of our mediator Chriſt Ieſus, to intercead betwixt God & man. Secondlie, to the ſubſtance of the Meſſe is craued, that the Preiſt offer the bodie and bloode of Chriſt: Wee come heere to receaue thay thinges; there the Prieſt offers thame to GOD the Father. Thirdly, bee this worke, (ſay they) they obtaine all good things; bee this worke, wrought they obtaine remisſion of ſins, als weill to the dead, as to the quick; but

in ſpeciall, they obteine remisſioun of ſins to the Prieſt, quha is the diſtributer, and to him quhom to the Preiſt applies that ſacrafice: And as to the reſt of the Kirk, quha are abſent, they obteine this remisſioun of their ſinnes, be this worke generally. Thir three things are neceſſare to the ſubſtance of the Meſſe. As to the accidents that mann concurr to the making of a Meſſe, they are of twa ſortes: Some of thame are alwaies neceſſar, with out the quhilk that actioun cannot bee: Some are not neceſſare againe, and the action may bee without thame, but not without a deadlie ſinne: Thir things that are neceſſare, concernis partly the preiſt, and partelie the action it ſelfe. The accidents that are neceſſary to the Preiſt, are of twa ſorts, an ſort are ſik, as without the quhilk he cānot be a preiſt, the vther ſort the quhilk without he cannot be free of dedlie ſin: The things without the quhilk hee can not be a Preiſt are thir: Except he haue power giuen of his Biſhop to conſecrate, quhilk power is iuſtified be the vnctioun, and ſhauing of his croune; except againe hee haue power to ſpeake, & that the roofe of his mouth be haill, that

hee may ſpeake, he cannot bee a Prieſt. Thir twa are alwaies neceſſare, and concurs to the perſon. Vther things againe, are not ſo neceſſare: as the Prieſt man be free fra ſuſpenſion, fra curſing, deadlie ſinne, and all eccleſiaſticall pane and cenſures, thir things are neceſſare to the perſon. There is againe, twa things neceſſare to the action; ane ſort without the quhilk the action cannot be, without the Lords prayer it cannot bee, without the fiue words of the inſtitutioun it can not bee. Vther things againe are not ſa neceſſare, as the conſecration of the place, quhere the Meſſe is ſaid, the Altar ſtane, the bleſſing of the Chalice, the Water, the Murgeons, ſinging, hee that ſuld help to ſay Meſſe, and the reſt. Swa they and wee in na waies agreis concerning the worde, quhat is meaned be it.
               Into the ſecond member, wee are als far ſundry, how this worde ought to bee intreated: Wee ſay the word tane as ſayd is, for the hail inſtitution, ought to be intreted efter this maner: Firſt there ought a lawfull Paſtour, quha hes his calling of God to intreat it▪ and this lawful Paſtour aught to intreat the word lawfully; quhat

is that? he aught to preach it, to proclaim it, and publicklie, with a cleare voyce to denounce it. He aught to open vpp, and declare the haill parts of it; quhat is the peoples part: and quhat is his awin part; how hee aught to deliuer and diſtribute, that bread and that wine: how the peple aught to receaue off his hand, that bread and that wine, to informe theirfaith; how they aught to receaue Chriſt his bodie and his bloode, ſignified bee that bread, and that wine; as alſo, he aught to teach thame, howe they ſuld come with great reuerence to that Table, and communicate with the precious bodie and blood of Chriſt. This he aught to doe in ane familiar language, that the people may vnderſtand him, that they may heare him, that they may perceaue and take vpp in their hearts, the things that he ſpeakes: For quhat auailes it to ȝou, to heare a thing quhiſpered, and not ſpoken out, or gif it be ſpoken out; quhat availes it ȝou to heare it, gif ȝee vnderſtand it not? For except ȝe heare Chriſt in an familiar and hamelie language, ȝe cannot vnderſtand: And except ȝee vnderſtand, it is not poſſible to ȝou to beleeue; and without beliefe,

there is na aplication of Chriſt; and except ȝe beleeue, & apply Chriſt to ȝour ſelfis; ȝour comming to the Sacrament, is in vaine. Sa of force, gif this Sacrament be lawfullie handled; the Paſtour mann preach the inſtitutioun of Chriſt, that it may be hard, & in ane familiar language, that it may bee vnderſtood; in ſicke ſort, that the faithfull peple may be informed how to receaue; & the Miniſter may knaw his part, howe to deliuer and diſtribute. This we ſay, ſuld be the right handling of the halie inſtitutioun of this Sacrament.
               Now quhat doe they? They in place of a Miniſter, Paſtour, or Biſhop, call him as thou pleaſis, quha is called lawfullie of God: they ſubſtitute a Prieſt, and ſurrogates an hireling, quha hes na calling, or office now in the Kirke of God. For the office of a Prieſt, as they vſe their Prieſthead, is na vther thing, but the office of Chriſt Ieſus, the office of the Mediatour betwixt God and vs. For they make their Prieſtes, dailie to offer vp Chriſt Ieſus to the Father. Nowe this is the Mediatour, Chriſt his office; and he did it ains for ay, and ains for all, ſayis the Apoſtle: ſa that, they can haue na entry, to doe this turne

over againe: And in reſpect, that their Prieſts preaſis to do this turn ouer again, quhilk hee hes done already; they doe it without a cōmand, they haue not a warrand in the word of God, but givand that they had a warrand of their calling, in the booke of God; ȝit they handle the ſacrament al wrang: for quhair they ſuld ſpeak forth clerly, they whiſper, & they conjure the elements be an certain kind of quhiſpering, quhair they ſuld ſpeak it in ane knawn language, that the people may vn derſtand; they ſpeak it in an vn knawn lan guage; and ſuppoſe they ſpak it in an knawin and familiar language: ȝit in reſpect they quhiſper it, the peple cannot be the better of it. And quhat ſall I ſay, ſeeing they handle the worde this way; ſuppoſe it be the very inſtitutioun it ſelfe: ȝit they ſa ſpill it in the handling, that it is not an halie Sacrament: Then we differ als meekle in the ſecond point; howe the worde aught to be handled and intreated.
               Now the third point comes in, to wit:Third head controuerred. quhat vertue this worde hes, how far the vertue of this worde extends the ſelfe. In this hed we grant & acknawlege, that the word hes a virtue, & the word tane, as ſaid

is, workes ſomething, euin towardes the ſame elements of bread and wine; for we acknawledge, that they elements, be the vertue of this worde are changed, not in thair ſubſtance, not in thair nature, nor ȝit in thair ſubſtantiall and naturall properties: But we grant, that the elements are chaunged in ane qualitie, quhilk they had not off before: In ſick ſort, that thir elements are tane fra the commoun vſe, quhairvnto they ſerued of before; and be the inſtitution of Chriſt, they are applyed now to ane halie vſe: Looke howe far, the haly vſe differs fra the commoun vſe; thair is als great difference, betwixt the elements this day in the actioun, and the thing that they wer ȝiſterday. For I grant that the elements are chaunged; and ȝit, this element proceeds not of the nature of the elements, fra an cloſed vertue, ſuppoſed to be in the words▪ nor fra the whiſpering of the words; but it proceeds, fra the will of Chriſt, fra the ordinance and appointment of Chriſt, ſet downe in his awin inſtitution: for that thing is halie, quhilk GOD cals haly, and that thing isThird head controuerred. prophane, quhilk God cals prophane.
               To lat ȝou vnderſtand, how thir ſignes

are made haly, it is neceſſair that thir twaHowe the Elements a
                        •
                      ſanctified. thinges bee conſidered. Firſt, quha is hee that makes thame halie, quhither God, Angell, or man: Secondly, quhaeuer hee be that marks thame halie; be quhat mean and way makes hee thame halie. And be the conſideration of thir twa, we ſal com to the conſideratioun, and right weying of the ſanctification of the elements: As to the firſt, we ſay; that God is onelie he, that may make a thing, quhilk was common, to be halie: So wee ſay, that God be his will and ordinance, declared and ſet downe in his word; hes made the things that were common be his appointment to bee haly. As to the way and meane, quhairby they are made halie; it is the word of GOD, the inſtitution of Chriſt, the will of Chriſt, declaired in his inſtitutioun, that makes thame halie: For the preachinge and opening vpp of the worde, and inſtitutioun of Chriſt, lats vs ſee, that God hes made thir things halie; & not onely, that he hes made thame halie, but lats vs ſee ane halie manner, how they ſuld be vſed; in quhat place, at quhat time, with quhat heart, and to quhat end. Sa it is the will of Chriſt, declared

in his inſtitutioun, quhairby the thinges that were commoun before, are nowe made halie. There is vther twa things alſo, that maks the ſame elements halie, and thir twa, are vſed in this inſtitutioun: there is praier and thankeſgiuing; for praier and thankſ giuing, makes the creatures of GOD to our vſe halie: quhair vtherwayis, gif wee receaue the creatures of God like dogs, and thanke him not for thame; it is ane ſure taken, that they were neuer Sanctified to our vſe.
               Be praier, we obtain grace and ſtrength from God, to vſe the creatures, and this hail action halilie and lawfullie, as it ſuld be: And therefore, not onely in this haly action, ſuld wee begin with God, and at the incalling vppon his name; but in all actions of the warld▪ wee ſuld beginne in Gods name. Sa it is the will of God, praier and thankſgiuing conjoyned with the elements, that makes thame halie: al thir three, contained in the action of the Supper, makes the ſeales halie: for beſide the will of God, declared in his inſtitutioun; In the ſupper, we vſe ane incalling, and in this incalling, wee vſe ane thankſgiuing: the

Sa the Elements are not made halie bee the worde of God onelie: but be the vſe of prayer and thankſgiuing, quhilk three are the onelie mean and way, quhereby thir things are ſanctified.
               To expreſſe and declair the ſanctificationThe word of blesſing & thanksgiuing vſed in differentlie, the ane expreſſed be▪ the vther. of the elements: the Evangeliſts & the Apoſtle PAVLE, vſes indifferentlie the word TO BLES, and TO GIVE THANKS, and commonlie they place the one word for the vther: for ȝee ſee that MARKE, and PAVLE, vſis the worde BLES: MATHEVV & LVKE, vſes the word TO GIVE THANKS, and all in ane ſignification: And MARKE himſelfe in the 14. of his Goſpell 22. vers ſpeking of the ſame action of the ſupper, he vſes the word TO BLES, and in the 23. verſe, he vſes the word, TO GIVE THANKS, and baith in ane ſignification; to lat ȝou ſee that the Apoſtle, Chriſt himſelfe, and the Evangeliſts, vſes the worde TO BLES, & TO GIVE THANKS, indifferentlie, to ſignifie the ſanctification, and conſecration of the Elements: except ȝee take the ane for the vther, it ſall bee hard to get ane good mening out of the Apoſtles words: for I remember the Apoſtle 1. CORINTH, 10. 16. hee ſayis: the cuppe of blesſing
                  
                  quhilk wee bleſſe; quhat is that? I take the worde to ſignifie as I haue ſaide, quhilk wee bleſſe, that is, quhilk wee ſanctifie & prepares bee blesſing. Sa to bleſſe and to giue thanks in the Supper, ſignifies navther thing, but to ſanctifie; or vtherwaies gif ȝee take the worde in ane vther ſignification, ȝee ſall fall in ane errour: for quhy? God is ſaid to bleſſe, and Man is ſaid to bleſſe: God is ſaid to bleſſe, quhen he giues good thinges to his creatures, for God his blesſing is ever effectuall, & therefore he is ſaide to bleſſe, quhen hee giues good things. Man againe is ſaide to bleſſe, ather priuatlie or publiklie, quhen he crauis blesſing at the hands of God to any man, quhen he bleſſes in the name, and at the commaund of God, any perſone or people. Nowe if ȝee aſcriue blesſing in ony of thir twa ſignifications to the cuppe, it is all wrang: for wee vſe nather to craue blesſing to inſenſible Elements, nor ȝit to bleſſe thame in the name of God. And God vſes to giue good thinges to the Sonnes of men, and not to inſenſible creatures: Therefore wee are compelled to vſe the word, bleſſe, in the third ſignificatio: The cup quhilk we bleſſe,
                  
that is, quhilk wee ſanctifie and prepares be blisſing. This far wee vnderſtand, for the ſanctification of the elements.
               Now lat ſee, how they ſanctifie ther elements, and quhat is the forme of their conſecratioun; ſa far as I vnderſtand of it, ſtands in thir fiue wordes: Hoc eſt enim corpus meum. It ſtands in thay fiue words; and in the quhiſpering of thame; for gif ȝee quhiſper thame not, ȝe tine the faſhion of incantation: for the thing that wee call ſanctifieng, they call quhiſpering: And the quhiſpering of they fiue words, they cal the cōſecration of the elements. And quhen the wordes are efter this way quhiſpered, they preſuppone ſick ane hid and monſtrous vertue, to bee incloſed in the ſyllabs; that the vertue and power quhilk flowes fra they wordes, is able to chaſe away halely, the ſubſtaunce of the bread: Sa that the verie bread, and ſubſtaunce of it, is altogither deſtroyed bee this power. Secondly, that this power that flowes fra thir words, is able to rugg and pull downe ane vther ſubſtaunce; to wit, the fleſhe and blood of Chriſt Ieſus, that ſits at the right hand of his Father, and is able to put it within the compaſſe

of that bread; that is a ſtraunge and ane great vertue, that not onelie will thrawe downe that ſubſtance, but put it within the compaſſe of that bread. They ſame fiue words, quhiſpered in this maner, hes ſick a monſtrous operation, ſay they, that they are able baith to chaſe away the ane ſubſtance, to rug downe ane vther, and to put it within the compaſſe of that bread. We altogither deny, that ther is ſik a vertue in thir wordes: for as I haue ſaid before; we deny not that the word hes a vertue, but wee deny that there is ſick a vertue incloſed in the wordes: wee deny the qualitie of the vertue, and the quantitie of the vertue, or that it flowes from ſic a fountaine. For we graunt that the word hes a vertue, there is neuer a woorde that God ſpake heir, but it hes a vertue joyned with it: but we deny that this vertue is incloſed in the ſillabs, in the whiſpering or pronouncing of the words: for gif there were ſic a vertue and power incloſed in the ſillabs, be that reaſon it ſuld followe, that there were a vertue in the figure and ſhape of the letter that makes vp the wordes. Now there is na man will thinke, that there is any vertue in the figure,

or ſhape of the letter, and there is as litle vertue in the ſillabs, or in pronouncing of the words themſelues: Sa wee deny that there is any vertue incloſed in the ſillabs, or reſident in the worde; but wee ſay, that there is a power conjoyned with the worde, and this power is not reſident in the word, but is reſident in the eternal worde, in the eſſentiall worde, quhereof IOHN makes mentioun in the firſt of his Evangell. The worde quhilk wes fra the beginning, that is, the Son of God Chriſt Ieſus. We ſay there is not a dram weight of this vertue, and power reſident in na creature that ever God created: but it is onely reſident in Chriſt Ieſus: And therefore there flowes na vertue from the ſyllabs, nor fra the wordes that ar ſpoken, but fra Chriſt & his ſpirit, quha giues the vertue to thay words. Swa wee differ in this, wee ſay that there is not a vertue reſident in the ſyllabs; wee ſay that the ſyllabs & pronouncing of the ſillabs, works nathing: but we ſay that the vertue is reſident in the perſon of the ſonne of God, and he workes be his awin word.
               Now we ſay, there cannot be ſik a monſtrous chaunge, as to ſay, that the whiſpering

ofſa mony words, ſuld change the

               The firſt principle that I lay, is this; ſeing that Chriſt Ieſus the ſonne of God, in
                     
                        •
                     e firſt ſorte argument, the time appointed, toke true fleſh of the wembe of the virgin, and vnited himſelfe with our nature in ane perſonall vnioun, to the end, that our nature, quhilk fell altogither fra integrity in the firſt Adam; might recouer the ſame in the ſecond Adam; ȝea, not only the ſame; but ſa meekle the greter, as our ſecond Adam excels the firſt in all degrees; and in reſpect he took on ane body, like vnto ours in al things, (ſinne excepted:) Sa, of necesſitie it mann folow, that the definition of ane true bodie, and the inſeparable properties therof, mann be competent to him. But thir

are the inſeparable properties; to wit, to be in ane certaine place, to bee finit, circumſcriued, viſible and palpable: For all thir conueines (quarto modo, as the Logicians ſayis) to ane body; ſa that they cannot bee ſeperate fra the ſubject, without the diſtructioun thereof. Then I reaſon on this maner; All true humane bodie, is in a certaine place: Chriſt Ieſus bodie is a true humane bodie: therefore it is in a certaine place. I call a place, a certaine condition of ane organical bodie, quherby it comes to paſſe, that quherever the bodie be, of necesſitie, it is limitat within that place, and quhill it is there, it cannot be els quhere. Craue ȝee the probation of my propoſition, of the Doctors? Read AVGVSTINE, writand to DARDANVS, ſpekand of this ſame bodie of Chriſt: Take away a certaine rome fra the bodies, and they ſall be in na place; and gif they be in na place, they are not. This ſame AVGVSTIN writand vpon IOHN in his 30. treatiſe: the bodie (ſayis he) into the quhilk the Lord raiſe; of necesſitie it mann be in ane place; but his diuine efficacie and nature, is diffunded euery quhere. And in his third Epiſtle, hee ſayis, howe meekle

that euer the bodie be, or how little that euer the bodie be; it behooues to occupy the bounds of a place. And beſides thir, the hiſtorie of the Acts, prooues maiſt euidentlie, Chriſts bodie to be in a certain place, as ACT. 3. 21. the wordes are thir: Quhom the heauen muſt containe, vntill the time that al things be reſtored, quhilk God had ſpoken be the mouth of all his Prophets. Suppoſe I need not to inſiſt, in the probation of thir things; ȝit I follow foorth. Secondlie then, I reaſon efter this maner; All humane bodie is finite and circumſcriued: but the bodie of Chriſt is a humane bodie: Quhat warrands of the Doctours haue I for this? I leaue many purpoſlie, and takes me onelie to AVGVSTINE: he writ and to DARDANVS; beleeue ſayis he, Chriſt to bee euery quhere, in ſa far as he is God, but onelie to be in heauen according to the nature of a true bodie; and in his 146. Epiſt. I beleeue ſayis he, the bodie of Chriſt to be ſa in the heauen, as it was in the earth, quhen he gaid vp to heauen: but it was circumſcriued in a certaine place in the earth: Ergo, it is ſa in the heauen, and conſequently, it cannot be in the Meſſe bread, and ther baith

at ane time. The laſt reaſon is this: al humane bodie, is viſible and palpable; but Chriſt hes a humane body, and he is corporally preſent, as ȝe ſay: therfore Chriſts bodie is viſible and palpable. I prieue my propoſition, be Chriſts awin words, tane out of LVK. 24. 39. Into the quhilk place, to perſwade the Apoſtles of the veritie of his bodie, and to prieue euidently, that it was not fantaſticall; he vſes the argument tane fra thir twa qualities, and hee commaunds his Apoſtles to feele and ſee, latting thame to witt thereby, that as thir twa ſenſes are the maiſt certaine of all the reſt: ſa are they maiſt able to diſcerne, quhither gif he was ane body, or ane ſpirite: as gif he wald ſay; gif I be viſible and palpable, ȝee may be out of doubt, that I haue an true bodie. For as the Poet ſayis, quhilk TERTVLIAN cites alſo to this ſam purpoſe. Tangere enim & tangi, niſi corpus, nulla poteſtres. Be thir arguments, it may be euidentlie ſeene, how this tranſubſtantiatioun may na wayis ſtand with the veritie of the bodie of Chriſt Ieſus.
               And as it fights with the fleſh of Chriſt Ieſus, ſa it repugnes directlie againſt the articles of our beleife: for into our beleife,

wee profes that Chriſt aſcended outSecond ſort of argument of this Earth to the Heauen; quhere hee ſits at the right hand of the father; quher he gouernes and directs all things in heuen and earth; fra the quhilk place, hee is to come in the laſt day to judg the warld▪ This article lats vs ſee, that he hes fleeted his dwelling, quhilk he had amangs vs in the erth, & hes aſcended into the heuens, quhere hee ſits at the right hand of his Father, and ſal remaine there, according to the teſtimonie of PET. quhilk I cited out of Act. 3. 21. vnto the laſt day. Gif he ſits at his Fathers right hand, & be to remain in heuen quhil the laſt day, he is not corporally into the bread: but the article ſais, that he ſits at the right hand of his father & PET. ſais in that place, that he is to be conteined in the heauens vnto the laſt day: therefore this tranſubſtantiatioun fightes directlie agains the articles of our beleife, & the manifeſt place of the ſcripture.
               Thirdlie, that it fightes agains the endThird ſorte of argument. quherfore this ſacrament wes inſtituted, it is mair nor evident: for the end of the Sacrament is ſpirituall, as the effect that flowes thereof is ſpiritual, and the inſtrument

quhereby this ſpirituall foode is aplyed to vs, is alſo ſpirituall: But of ane naturall and corporall preſence, ane ſpirituall effect can neuer flowe: therefore the corporall and naturall preſens of the bodie and blood of Chriſt Ieſus, repugns directlie to the end of this ſacrament: for the corporall preſence mann haue a corporall eating, of this eating, follows a digeſtion in the ſtomach, & the thing that is digeſted in the ſtomach, is neuer able to feede thy ſoule to life eternall: Sa, this corporall preſence mann ay tende to ane corporall end, quhilk is directlie contrair to the ende, quherefore this Sacrament wes inſtituted.
               Attour, gif the bred were tranſubſtantiate,Vther arguments to the ſame effect. it ſuld become the thing ſignified; gif it becomes the thing ſignified, this ſacrament ſuld wante a ſigne, and ſa it ſuld not be an ſacrament: for euery ſacrament as ȝe hard, is ane ſigne. Now to ſay, that the accidents of true bread, as the hew & the roundnes of it, that they may ſerue as ſignes, that is mair nor follie: for betwixt the ſigne and the thing ſignified, there man be ane conformitie: but there is no conformitie betwixt the accidents, and

the bodie and blood of Chriſt Ieſus: for gif ſa were, the accidents be houed to nuriſh vs corporally, as the body and blood of Chriſt Ieſus, is appointed to nuriſh vs ſpiritually. Farther, gif the bread become the bodie of Chriſt Ieſus, it ſulde followe that hee had ane bodie without bloode: for hee hes inſtituted ane ſigne, a pairt to repreſent his blood. Alſwa, gif there had bene ſick a wonderfull thing, as they ſpeake of, in this ſacrament, there walde haue bene plaine mention made thereof in the ſcripture: For God himſelfe works neuer a notable worke, but hee vtters it ather in opin tearmes, or priuat termes in the ſcripture, that thereby he may bee glorified in his wonderfull works; as ȝee may reade in the Evangell IOHN, 2. 8. quher the water wes changed into wine, GENE. 2. 22. quhere the Ribbe of ADAM wes changed into HEVA. EXOD. 7. 10. quhere AARONS rodde wes turned in a Serpent. There ȝee ſee, that chaunging is manifeſtlie expreſſed: Therefore I ſay, gif there had bin ſic a monſtrous change in thir elements of the Supper, as they affirme, the ſcripture walde not haue concealed it, but expreſſed it: but in reſpect,

there is na mention made of this change in the ſcripture: therefore there is na ſic change in this action. Farther, gif there were ſic a change, as they ſpeake, ather it is before their words of conſecration be ſpoken, or followes efter that ſame word be ſpoken; gif the change bee before the words of the conſecration be ſpoken, the conſecration is ſuperfluous, & their propoſition is fals; gif the change bee efter the word be ſpoken, This bread is my bodie; their propoſition is fals alſo, becaus the worde bread is ſpoken, or the laſt ſillab of their fiue words bee pronounced. Thir, and infinit ma abſurdities followes of this doctrine.
               And ȝit they obſtinatly perſeuere, and vrges vs with the letter, affirming that the wordes of Chriſt are ſa plaine, that they admitte na figure. They wald haue ſpoken mair aduiſedlie, gif they hadde ſought counſall of AVGVSTINE, to haue diſcerned betwixt ane figuratiue ſpeache and ane proper: for hee into the thirde booke, and 16. Chap. of Chriſtian doctrine, ſpeaks efter this ſort, gif the ſpeach ſays he, appear to command a wickednes or a miſchiefe, or to forbidd ane happines,

or ane welfair, it is not proper, it is not figurate, and he ſubjoynes for ane Example, a place out of IOHN. 6. 53. Except ſayis our Maſter, ȝee eat the fleſhe of the ſonne of Man, and drinke his blood, ȝee haue na life in ȝou: quhereunto AVGVSTINE adjoynes, this ſpeach ſayis hee, apeares to command a miſchiefe, therefore it is a figurat ſpeach, quhereby wee are commanded to communicate with the ſufferings of Chriſt Ieſus, and with gladnes to locke vp in perpetuall memorie, that the fleſh of the Lord wes crucified and wounded for vs: for vtherwaies it were mair horrible (as this ſame AVGVSTINE, maks mention in the ſecond book agains the aduerſaries of the lawe) to eat the fleſhe of Chriſt Ieſus reallie, then to murther him, and mair horrible, to drink his blood, then to ſhed his blood; ȝit notwithſtanding, they hauld ay ſtill, on ea tune, and ſayis, that thay words aught to bee tane properlie. Sa that it appeares, that of verie malice, for contradictions cauſe, to the ende onely, that they may gainſtand the truth, they will not acknaledge this to be ane ſacramentall ſpeach. For they are compelled, nil they, wil they

in vther ſpeaches of the like ſorte, to acknowledge ane figure, as GENE. 17. 10. circumciſion is called the couenant: and EXOD. 12. 11. the lambe is called the paſſouer, and MATH. 20. 28. the cupp is called his blood, and LVKE 22. 20. the cupp is called the newe teſtament, and 1. COR, 10. 4. the rocke is called Chriſt. All thir ſpeaches are ſacramentall, and receauis a kinde of interpretation, ȝit they malitiouſly preas to deny vs this in thir words; (Hoc eſt corpus meum) quhilke they are compelled to grant in the reſt, as ſpecialy quhere PAVL cals the rocke Chriſt.
               Nowe quhen they are dung out of this fortres, they flie als vnhappely to the ſecond: to wit, that God bee his omnipotency, may mak the body of Chriſt baith to be in heauen, and in the bread baith at ane time: ergo, ſay they, it is ſa. Gif I denied their conſequent, they wald be weil faſhed to proue it: but the queſtiō ſtands not heir, quhither God may do it or not: but the queſtioun ſtands, quhither GOD wil it or not, or may wil it or not. And we ſay reuerently, that his majeſty may not wil it: for ſuppoſe it be true, that he may, mony things quhilk he wil not: ȝit it is as

true; that there is mony things, that hee may not will, of the quhilk ſort, this is: & thir are reduced to twa ſorts. Firſt hee may not will they thinges, that are contrare to his nature, as to be changeable, as to decay, & ſic vthers. For gif he might will thir things, they ſulde not be arguments of ane puiſſance, or of ane power, but rather certaine arguments of his impotencie and infirmitie: And therefore ſuppoſe he may not will thir things, hee leaues not of to bee omnipotent: but ſa mekle the rather, his conſtant, and invincible power is knawin. Secondlie God may not wil ſome things, be reaſon of an preſupponed conditioun, as ſick thinges, quher of he hes concluded their contrair of before: of the quhilk ſort, is this, whilk is now controuerted: For ſeing that God hes concluded that all human body, ſuld conſiſt of organicall partes, and therfore to be comprehended, and circumſcriued within ane, and the awin proper place: And als, ſeeing he hes appointed Chriſt Ieſus to haue the like body, and that not for ane time, but eternallie. In reſpect of this determined will, I ſay, God may not will the contrair now, ather to aboliſhe

this bodie quhilk hee hes appointed to be eternall; ather ȝit to make it at ane time, in reſpect of ane thing a bodie and not a bodie, quantified & not quantified, finite and infinite, locall and not locall. For to will thir thinges, quhilk are plaine contradicent in thame ſelfes, hee may not, na mair nor it is posſible to him to will a lie. Swa, it may bee ſeene of al men, that wee preſerue the omnipotencie of God, and with reuerence from our harts, acknawledges him onely, to bee onelie omnipotent, and wils all men to eſteeme thame as calumniators, quha abuſes the ears of the ſimple anes, to perſwade tham the contrair of vs.
               They are not content with this, but they ſay, that the Lord may wil a contradiction, and make baith the parts to be true at ane time. And to prooue this, they wald bring in, the miracles quhilk GOD works; as they wald ſay, euery miracle includes a contradiction. As for example: God made a virgine to beare a ſonn, they thinke this warke brings with it a contradictioun; to beare a ſonne, ſay they, is the ane part of the contradictioun, and to bee a virgine, is the vther pairt of

the contradictioun. This warke is a miracle, but it implies na contradictioun: For concerning the halie virgins birth, therein is na contradiction. There was a miracle indeede, that a Virgin ſuld bear a ſonne contrare to the cours of nature; for to be a virgin, and ȝit to haue a child, are not contradictorie, gif ſhe haue conceaued and brought furth be miracle, as did the bleſſed virgin: but to bee a virgin and not a virgin at ane time, this is the contradictioun. Sa Chriſts bodie to bee viſible and inviſible, locall and not local, at ane time; is in everie reſpect the like contradiction: and therefore imposſible to be true.
               Their vther Example of Chriſts entering in, the doors being cloſed and ſhut, quhat apearance of contradiction hes it? Can they preiue that he entered through the doores? and gif hee did, then there wes ane alteration of qualities, and that be miracle; ather in Chriſts bodie or in the doores, but na contradiction in nature: vnles ȝou know not quhat is a contradiction. Their third and laſt example of the fier in NABVCADNEZERS Oven, quhilk conſumed the miniſters, but hurt

not thame that were in the middeſt of it; apears to be of na weight, be that quhllk hes already bene anſwered. They imagin as apears, that in every miracle, a contradiction is implied, quhilk is abſurde. Gif they can prooue that this fier wes baith hotte and cold, then they ſay ſome thing to the purpoſe: but that it burns vp ſome and hurts not vthers, is na contradiction; becauſe, bee miracles, the force thereof wes repreſſed. Swa, this ſecond ground halds faſt; God may not will that thing, quhilk implies a contradiction: but ſa it is, that the reall preſence of the bodie of Chriſt in the Sacrament, implies a contradictioun; for it makes the bodie of Chriſt, viſible, and inuiſible, compaſt and not compaſt at ea time: therefore, GOD may not will ſick a thing.
               Quhen they are dung out of this, theyTheir laſ
                        •
                      refuge. make their laſt refuge, to an peremptour defence in their opinioun; for ſay they, Chriſts body is exemed fra phyſical rules; for Theologie is not ſubject to phyſicall rules. It is a verie il gathered cōſequence, to ſay, that we ſubject Theologie to Phyſicke; becauſe that wee firſt, according to Theologie, quhilk is the law of God, and

nixt, according to Phyſicke, quhilk is the lawe of nature, defends the naturall properties, of the true and naturall bodie of Chriſt Ieſus. Then I grant this, that Theologie is not ſubject to Phyſick; quhat of this? Ergo, Chriſts bodie is exemed fra phyſicall rules. How followes that I pray ȝou? Be quhat law may ȝee exeme, or can ȝee exeme the bodie of Chriſte? Bee the law of nature, ȝe cannot: for he was maid of the ſeed of DAVID, and tooke on true fleſh of the wembe of the virgin: And far leſſe, be the law of God: quhilk is Theologie: For ȝee knaw, that Chriſt was appointed from all eternitie, to take on our nature, and to become true man. Indeed it is true, that the law of God, cannot bee ſubject to the law of nature: For the law of nature, flows of the law of God, as out of the awin ſpring: but it is als true, that gif ȝee exeme Chriſtes bodie, fra the lawe of nature, ȝee ſall exeme it alſo fra the law of God. For I affirme, that the ſcriptures ſa conſents with the law of nature; that gif ȝee denie the ane, ȝee ſall denie the vther; and gif ȝee admitte the ane, ȝee ſall admit alſo the vther. Therefore, gif ȝou looke weil about ȝou; ȝee ſall

finde the bauke in ȝour awin eie: for ȝee peruert, baith the law of God, & the lawe of nature, bee ane new inuented phyſicke of ȝour awin: for quhaſoeuer he be, that attributes to ane, and the ſelf ſame body, natural and vnnatural properties, quhilk directlie feights agains thame ſelfs; I ſay, this man peruerts baith true Theologie, and Phyſicke: but ȝee, to ane and the ſelfe ſame bodie of Chriſt Ieſus, attribute naturall and vnnaturall properties: therfore it is ȝee that peruerts, baith the vſe of true Theologie, and the ordour ſett downe, and eſtabliſhed in nature. Craue ȝee the reaſon of my propoſition? I ſay, it behooues als weill in Theologie, as in Phyſicke of necesſitie, ane of the contradicent enunciations to be falſe. But ains to make ane end with ȝou; we ſal anſwer to ȝour laſt ſubterfuge.
               For ſa ȝee reaſon; a glorified bodie, is not ſubject to phyſicall rules; but Chriſts bodie is glorified: therefore it is not ſubject to phyſicall rules. Firſt of all, or wee anſwer directly, we man conſider, quherin ſtands the glorification of ane bodie: & then, I ſay, the anſwere ſall be eaſie: the Apoſtle PAVL, 1. COR. 15. 42. ſpeakes efter

this maner. Sa alſo, ſayis he, is the reſurrection of the dead. The body is ſawen in corruptiō, & is raiſed in incorruption; It is ſawin in diſhonor, & is raiſed in glorie: It is ſawin in weaknes, and is raiſed in power. And a litle efter; this corruption mann put on incorruption, and this mortality, mann put on immortalitie. Be this cleare Antitheſis, PAVLE clearlie deſcriues, the glorification of ane bodie: for hee oppones thir twa; the vnglorified bodie, and the glorified bodie: And to the vnglorified body, he aſcriues corruption, ignominie, infirmitie, carnallitie, & mortalitie. To the glorified bodie againe, he attributes incorruptioun, glorie, power, ſpiritualitie, and immortalitie. Of this oppoſition, wee may gather eaſilie, quhat the reſurrection & glorification apports to the bodie. Shortly, bee thame we ſee, that the body is onely ſpoiled of corruptioun, ſhame, infirmitie, naturalitie, and mortalitie: And to take vp all in an word, it becomes, onely ſpoyled of all the infirmities of our nature; that it may be cled, with ane mair glorious apparrell; as with incorruption, power, glorie, ſpiritualitie, and immortalitie. Wee ſee then that this

glorification imports ane change indeed; but I beleue na man will be ſa mad, as to eſteme this change to be made in the ſub ſtance: for gif ſa wer, the aulde ſubſtance behoued to decay, and ane newe ſulde ariſe: but wee hear na worde of ſic things in this deſcriptiō, & as litle is the change made, in the quantitie: for wee hear na word, nather of augmentatioun, nor diminution of any ſubſtance, quhilk behoued to be, gif it were in the quantitie. The fardeſt that wee can perſaue; this mutatioun conſiſts in the qualities, bee the quhilk, the bodie caſts of the auld coate of infirmitie, and cleathes it ſelfe, with the coate of Glorie: For Chriſt efter hee rais, he baith gaide and come, wes ſeene and twitched. Of the things before deduced, it clearlie followes, that in reſpect the glorie of the bodie of Chriſt, hes wrought na change in his nature & ſubſtance; and conſequently, in his naturall dimenſions; nather ȝit in any vther eſſentiall propertie: that therefore the glorificatioun of his bodie, exemes it not fra the rules of phyſicke. For ſa lang as the nature of ane true bodie remaines, there is na ſupernaturall gifts, quherewith it

may be glorified; war they neuer ſa high, ſa farre as may bee gathered of the ſcriptures of GOD, that may hurt, ather the nature, or the natural propertie of it. For ther is na gift nor qualitie, that may hurt natur, but that gift that is agains nature: but the ſupernaturall gift, is nather vnnaturall, nather ȝit agains nature: therefore it cannot hurt nor impaire nature. And my reaſoun is this: They gifts, that decores and beautifies nature, they cannot hurt nor impair nature: but al ſupernaturall gifts, beautifies and decores nature: Therefore they cannot take away, nather nature, nor ȝit, the naturall propertie.
               They leaue vs not ſa, but out of this ſame doctrine of PAVLE, concerning the glorification of the bodie, they draw ane objection, to preaſe vs. PAVL grants, that ane glorified bodie, is ane ſpirituall bodie: but ane ſpirituall bodie, is ane inuiſible bodie: therefore ane glorified bodie, is inuiſible; and bee the conſequent, the bodie of Chriſt is inuiſible. Suppoſe the argument bee not formall; ȝit to make ſhort, I denie ȝour aſſumption: For gif there were na mair, but that ſame worde

                  bodie, that word might be ane argument to ȝou, that the ſpirituall bodie is not inviſible. But ȝit, to open vpp the matter mair clearlie, according to the minde of PAVL in that place. PAVLE in ane word, as it were, in the 44. verſe of that ſame Chap. ſhewes the change that ſal become in the qualities of the body, be the reſurrection: For he ſayis of ane naturall bodie, it ſall become ane ſpirituall bodie. He ſtraight way in the nixt verſe, immediatlie following, expones thir twa qualities: for in the 45. verſe, that is called an natural bodie, ſays he, quhilk is maintained and quickned, be an liuing ſaul only; ſic as Adams was: and againe, that is ſaid to bee ane ſpirituall bodie, quhilke togither, beſide the ſaul, is quickned with ane farre mair excellent vertue, to witt; with the ſpirite of God, quhilk deſcended fra Chriſt, the ſecond Adam vnto vs. Then according to this ground, I anſwere with AVGVSTINE ad Conſtantium: As the naturall bodie is not ane ſaull, but ane bodie; euen ſa, the ſpiritual bodie, is not ſaid to be a ſaull, but ane bodie; and bee conſequent, it is not inuiſible.
               But to take vpp this head, I ſall giue

thame onelie ane knot to looſe, and ſa make an end of this point. Then I reaſon, gif therefore Chriſts bodie is naturallie and really in the Supper, be reaſon that it is glorified, it follows conſequentlie, that quhen it was not glorified, it culd not be reallie preſent: but it wes not glorified quhen this Supper wes firſt inſtituted: therefore it wes not reallie preſent in the bread, at Chriſts firſt ſupper. Gif his body wes not naturally preſent in the bred at the firſt Supper, it cannot be naturally preſent nowe: For quhatſoeuer ȝee vſe nowe in the adminiſtration of ȝour Supper, or of ȝour Meſſe, call it as ȝe will, according to ȝour awin confesſioun, ȝe vſe it according to the ordinance, forme and maner, that Chriſt Ieſus himſelfe vſed in his firſt Supper: For ȝee ſay plainelie in ȝour diſputatioun at POYSSIE▪, and in all the reſt of ȝour workes; That Chriſt Ieſus firſt of all obſerued that form, quhilk ȝee vſe in ȝour Meſſe, and left it to his Apoſtles, and to their ſucceſſors, that they ſulde doe the like: and ſa bee ȝour awin words, ȝee haue drawne ȝour ſelfes in a Hoſe-net, & crucified ȝour Meſſe. Quhat can ȝe anſwere to this? Ȝe will not ſtande

dumbe I am aſſured; for maintenance of ȝour religion, ȝee man ſay ſomthing: for gif this reaſon bear it away, ȝe haue done with it.
               Then wee ſay, quod the Papiſtes, that ſuppoſe the bodie of Chriſt, quhilk wes locallie preſent with the reſt of his diſciples wes not glorified, ȝit the bodie quhilk he exhibite in the bread wes glorified. Ȝee might as weill haue halden ȝour peace, and ſaide nathing: For take tent to the wordes of the text, as they are written. Luk. 22. 19. quhere it is ſaide, & hee toke the bread, and quhen he had giuen thanks, hee brake it, & gaue to them ſaying, this is my bodie quhilke is giuen for ȝou, and PAVL. 1. COR. 11. 24. hes thir wordes, Take, eate: This is my bodye, quhilke is broken for ȝou. This relatiue quhilk, is relatiue to the bodie, quhilke wes exhibited in the bred: for according to ȝour awin confesſion, they words are pronounced vpon the bread, & directed to it. But that ſame bodie wes giuen and broken for vs, that is to ſay, crucified and demayned with anguiſh & dolors. Then I reaſon efter this ſorte. To be crucified and broken with anguiſhe and dolours,

can on na waies agree and conueine with a glorified bodie: but the bodie that Chriſt exhibite in the bread, is ſayd of the Evangeliſts, to be crucified and broken for vs: Ergo, that bodie wes not glorified.
               Now laſt of all, they are not ȝit content, but ſayis, Chriſt can make the bread his body, and therfore his bodie is really preſent. That Chriſt can make the bread his bodie, wee grant: for Chriſt beeing God, can do quhatſoeuer hee will: Onelie let them ſhewe, that Chriſt will make of reall bread, his reall fleſhe, and then this controuerſie is brought to ane end. Chriſt indeed makes the bread his body, not reallie, but ſacramentallie: For Chriſt hes not a bodie made of bread, his body wes made ains of the pure ſubſtance of his bleſſed Mother: ane vther bodie then this, or oftener made then ains, hes hee nane: quherefore all doctrine that teaches Chriſts bodie to be made of bread, is impious, and hereticall: The Papiſts doctrine of reall preſence teaches, that Chriſts bodie in the Sacrament is made of bread, bee changing the bread into his bodie, through force of conſecration:

quherefore wee may bauldlie & truelie conclude, that their doctrine of reall preſence, is baith wicked and hereticall. Now in concluſion of this head, I beſeke thame, ſeeing that reaſoun failes thame, that they fight not agains God, for maintenance of a lie, how auld that ever it be, (for the Diuell is auld aneugh, and ȝit he coulde neuer change his nature) but lat thame rather glorifie God, in confesſing thir ſpeaches to be ſacramentall.
               Then quhat is the reaſon and ground,The reaſon that moues the Papiſ
                        •
                     es to thinke▪ that Chriſts bodie cannot be preſent in the Sacrament, except it be reallie, corporallie, & ſubſtantialy preſent. quherefore the papiſts pulles downe the ſubſtance of the bodie of Chriſt, and the blood of Chriſt, and makes the very ſubſtance to be corporallie, reallie, and ſubſtantiallie in the Sacrament? The reſon is this, becauſe they cannot ſee be their naturall judgement, nor cannot vnderſtand be their natural wit, the trueth of this, to wit, how Chriſtes fleſh and blood can be preſent in the Sacrament, except hee bee preſent to their corporall hand, to their corporall mouth and ſtomach. Gif they had an light to inform them, that Chriſt might be preſent in the Supper, and not to the hande, to the mouth or ſtomach: they walde neuer haue thought of ſick a

monſtrous preſence, as they compt to be there: but being deſtitute of the ſpiritual light, they followe their naturall reaſons and maks a naturall and carnall preſens. Swa that ȝee haue this leſſoun to note ofobſeruation this: There is na man that hes not the ſpirit of God to vnderſtande this word: this is my bodie, but out of queſtion, he will doe as the Papiſtes does; that is, he will vnderſtande it carnally: and ſa they miſknowing the right meaning of it, it is na maruell, ſuppoſe they and wee differ in this mater.
               For will ȝee ſpeare at the Papiſt firſt,The diuerſe opinions concerning the preſence of the bodie of Chriſt in the ſacrament. gif the true bodie of Chriſt be there, or gif the true fleſhe and blood of Chriſt be there: he wil ſay, it is there. Wil ȝe ſpeare quherein? He will ſay in, and vnder, the accidents of the bread and wine, vnder the hewe and roundnes of the breade. Will ȝee ſpeare againe at him, be quhat inſtrument it is receaued? he will tell ȝou be the mouth and ſtomach of the bodie: ſa this is their gros vnderſtanding of the bodie and blood of Chriſt. Will ȝe ſpeare at the VBIQVITER, gif the true bodie of Chriſt be preſent? he will ſay it is. Will ȝe ſpear gif it be in, with, or vnder the bred?

hee will anſwere, it is in the bread, contentiuè, that is, that the bread conteines it. Wil ȝee ſpeare at him, to quhat inſtrument it is offered? hee will anſwere, that the bodie of Chriſt, is offered to the mouth of our bodie, and that the blood of Chriſt is offered to the mouth of our bodie, as the Papiſts dois. Will ȝe ſpeare at vs again, how Chriſt Ieſus his true boandOur opinion. blood is preſent? wee wil ſay, that they are ſpirituallie preſent, reallie preſente, that is preſente in the Supper, and not in the bread: we will not ſay, that his true fleſhe is preſent to the hande, or to the mouth of our bodie, but wee ſay, it is ſpirituallie preſent, that is, preſent to thy ſpirit and faithfull ſaull; Ȝea even als preſent inwardlie to thy ſaull, as the bread and wine, are preſent to thy bodie outwardelie. Wil ȝe ſpeere then, gif the bodie and blood of Chriſt Ieſus bee preſent in the Supper? Wee anſwere in a word, they are preſent in the Supper: but not in the bread and wine, nor in the accidents nor ſubſtance of bread and wine: And we make Chriſt to be preſent in the Supper, becauſe he is preſent to my ſaull, to my ſpirit and faith. Alſwa, we make him preſent

in the Supper; becauſe I haue him in his promeis, This is my body, quhilke promeis is preſent to my faith, and the nature of faith, is to make thinges that are abſente in thame ſelues ȝit preſent: And therefore, ſeeing he is baith preſent be fayth in his promeis, and preſent bee the vertue of his halie ſpirit, quha can ſay but hee is preſent in the Supper.
               But ȝit the word wald bee opened vp, quhat wee mean bee the worde preſent,How a thing is ſaid to be preſent and abſent. howe a thing is ſayde to bee preſent and abſent? And knowing this, ȝee ſall finde all the matter eaſie. I ſaye, thinges are ſaide to bee preſent, as they are perceaued bee ony outwarde or inwarde ſenſe, and as they are perceaued bee ony of the ſenſes; ſa are they preſent, and the farther they bee perceaued, the farther preſent; and be quhat ſenſe ony thing is perceaued, to that ſame ſens it is preſent. As gif it be outwardlie perceaued, be ane outward ſenſe; that thing is outwardlie preſent. As for example, gif it bee perceaued bee the outward ſight of the eie, be the outward hearing of the ear, be the outwarde feeling of the hand, or taiſt of the mouth; it is outwardlie preſent: Or

gif ony thing be perceiued be the inward eie, be the inward taiſt and feeling of the ſaull; this thing cannot bee outwardlye preſent: but it mann be ſpirituallie, and inwardly preſent to the ſaull. Sa I ſay, euerie thing is preſent, as it is perceaued. Sa that gif ȝee perceaue not a thing outwardlie, it is outwardlie abſent; and giff ȝe perceaue not a thing inwardlie, it is inwardlie abſent. It is not diſtance of place that maks a thing abſent, nor propinquitie of place, that makes a thing preſent: but it is only the perception of ony thing be ony of thy ſenſes, that makes a thing preſent, & the not perception, that maks a thing abſent. I ſay; ſuppoſe the thing it ſelfe, were neuer ſa farre diſtant, gif thou perceaue it bee thine outward ſenſe, it is preſent to thee. As for example, my body and the Sunn, are als far diſtant in place, as the heauen is fra the earth; and ȝit this diſtaunce ſtaies not his preſens to mee: Quhy? Becauſe I perceaue the Sunne be mine eie and vther ſenſes; I feele him and perceaue him bee his heat, bee his light, and bee his brightnes: Swa, gif a thing were neuer ſa far diſtant, gif we haue ſenſes to perceaue the ſame, it is preſent to

vs. Then the diſtance of place makes not a thing abſent to thee, & thou haue ſenſes to perceaue it. Siclike, the propinquitie of place makes not a thing preſent, & it were neuer ſa near, gif thou haue not ſenſes to perceaue it. As for example, gif the ſunne ſhine in thy verie eine holes, gif thou bee blinde, hee is not preſent to thee, becauſe thou cannot perceaue him. A ſweete tune will neuer bee preſent to ane deafe ear, ſuppoſe it bee ſung in the eare of that mā, becaus he hes not a ſens to perceaue it: And a weill tauld tale will neuer be preſent to a foole, becauſe hee cannot vnderſtand it, nor hes not judgement to perccaue it. Swa, it is not the neernes, northe diſtāce of place that makis any thing preſent or abſent, but onelie the perceauing, and not perceauing of it.
               Nowe the worde being made cleire, ſpeere ȝee howe the bodie of Chriſt isHow the bodie of Chriſt is preſent. preſent? To giue our judgement in aword, as ȝee haue hard fra time to time, he is preſent, not to the outward ſenſes, but to the inwarde ſenſes, quhilk is faith, wrought in the ſaull. For this actioun of the Sacrament and of the Supper, is partlie

corporall, and partelie ſpirituall. I call this actioun partely corporall, not in rereſpect only, that the objects, that is, that bread and wine are corporall: but alſo in reſpect my mouth, quhervnto thir things are offered; the inſtrument quherby, and the maner how thir things are receaued, are al corporall & natural. I call the ſame action againe, partlie ſpirituall; not only, in reſpect of Chriſt Ieſus, quha is the heauenlie and ſpirituall thing of the Sacramēt; but alſo in reſpect of my ſaul, quhervnto Chriſt is offred and giuen: in reſpect the inſtrument quhereby, and the maner how he is receaued, are all ſpirituall: For I gett not Chriſt corporallye, but ſpirituallie. Swa, in thir reſpects, I call this action, partlie corporall, and partlie ſpirituall.
               Now confound me not thir twa ſorts of actions, the corporall and naturall ſigns, with the ſpiritual thing, ſignified therby: Confound not againe, the mouth of the bodie, with the mouth of the ſaull: Confound not thirdlie, the outward manner of receauing bee the hand of the bodie, with the ſpirituall maner of receauing, be the hand of the ſaull. And ſa it ſall be

exceeding cleare to ſee, that ilke thing ſal be preſent to the awn inſtrument, that is; the bodie of Chriſt, quhilk is the ſpirituall thing ſignified, ſall be preſent to the ſpirituall mouth and hand; and the bread and wine, quhilk are the corporal ſignes, are preſent to the corporall mouth and hand. Then howe is any object preſent? A corporal object, is corporallie preſent, and ane inwarde object, is inwardly preſent: Of quhat nature is the thing ſignified? It is of ane heauenlie nature. Then ſpeare ȝe, how he is preſent? He is ſpirituallie and heauenlie preſent to thy ſaull, & the mouth of thy ſaul; quhilk is faith. For it were a prepoſterous thing, to mak the thing ſignified preſent to thy bellie, or to the mouth or eie of thy body; for gif ſa were, it ſuld not be ſpirituallie preſent: Becauſe euery thing is preſent, as it accords to the awin nature: Is it a bodily thing, it is bodilie preſent, and gif it be a heauenlie thing, it is ſpirituallie preſent. Sa I thinke, na man can doubt, how the bodie of Chriſt is preſent; hee is not carnallie preſent, but ſpirituallie preſent to my ſaull, and to faith in my ſaull. This far concerning the manner of his preſence.
               
                  Now the laſt part of our conference, isThe laſt head in 
                        •••
                     
                     trouerſie betwixt vs and the papiſts. this; we haue to conſider, to quhome the words aught to be directed & pronounced: For we and the Papiſts differs in this laſt head. Wee ſay, that the words aught to be directed and pronounced vnto the people, to the faithfull communicants. They, be the plat contrair, ſayis, that the words aught not to be directed, nor pronounced to the people, but to the elements; and not to bee clearely pronounced, but quhiſpered on the elements: Sa that, gif they be ſpoken to the people, or ſpoken openlie, their charme auails not. Now I ſay, as the actioun is peruerted be thame in all the reſt; ſa they peruert it in this point alſo; in ſpeaking that to the dumb elements, quhilk they ſuld ſpeake to the people of God. For I ſall prooue it clearly be three arguments, tane out of the Scriptures, that the words aught not to be ſpokē to the bread, but to the people of God.
               And firſt I ſay, the promiſes of mercie and grace, aught to bee directed and pronounced to thame, in quhome the Lord performes thame, and makes tham effectuall. But ſa it is, that the promiſes

of mercy and grace, are performed and made effectuall, not in bread and wine, but in faithfull men and women: Therefore, thir promiſes ſuld bee directed to faithfull men and women. Now heere is the promiſe of mercie & grace. This is my bodie, quhilk is broken for Ȝou. And this promiſe, is made to na vther thing, but to faithfull men and women; and ſa to tham onely, it aught to be directed. Secondly, we haue to conſider, that this ſacrament, ſeales vp a couenant of grace and mercy. Now quhom with makes God his couenant of mercie and grace? Will he make a couenaunt with a peece bread, or anie dumb element? There is na man will enter in a couenant with his ſeruant: lat be to enter in a couenant with a dumbe element. Sa in reſpect, this Sacrament ſeals vp a couenant; this couenaunt of necesſity, man be knit vp with ane faithfull ſaul, and not with the dumbe element: and therefore, thir words cannot be directed to the elements. Thirdlie, looke to the end, quherefore this Sacrament was appointed: Is it not to lead vs to Chriſt? Is it not to nuriſh my faith in Chriſt? Is it not to nuriſh mee in ane conſtant perſwaſioun

of the Lordes mercie in Chriſt? Was this Sacrament appointed to make the elements Gods? Na: For will ȝee marke Gods purpoſe in this inſtitution; ȝe will find, that Chriſt hes not ſet down his inſtitution, to nobilitat the elements, to fauor and reſpect the elements, quhilk were bread and wine ȝiſterday, to bee Gods to day. Wee on the contrair, ſayis plainelie, that the inſtitutioun of Chriſt, lookes not to the elements, to alter their nature. Indeed, it is appointed to alter vs, to chaunge vs, and to make vs mair and mair ſpirituall, and to ſanctifie the elements to our vſe. But the ſpecial end, looks to this; to make vs halie, and mair and mair to growe vpp in a ſure faith in Chriſt, & not to alter the elements, nor to make thame Gods. And therefore, be all thir three argumentes, it is euident, that the words, aught not to bee directed to the elements, but to the people & faithfull communicants.
               Now to make an end of this, there isConcluſion with an exhortation. ane thing, without the quhilk, wee cannot profit; lat vs diſcourſe neuer ſa lang, vppon the right vnderſtanding of the Sacrament. Ȝee ſee nowe, all that is

ſpoken, concerning the Sacrament, is grounded and depended vppon fayth: Haue a man faith, albeit it were neuer ſa ſmall, hee getts ſome grippe of Chriſt, and ſome inſight in the vnderſtanding of this Sacrament: but lacking faith, ſuppoſe a man paine him ſelfe, to make the Sacraments neuer ſa ſenſible, it is not posſible, that hee cann gette a grippe of Chriſte, or onie inſight in him: For without faith, wee can not bee Chriſtians; wee can nather get a ſight of God, nor feele God in Chriſt, without faith. Faith is the onelie thing, that tranſlates our ſaules out of that death and damnation, quhereintill wee were conceaued and borne, and plants vs into life. Swa the haill ſtudie and indeuour of a chriſtian ſulde tend to this. To craue that the Lorde in his mercie walde illuminat his minde, with the eie of fayth, and walde kendle in his heart a loue of fayth, and worke in his hart, a thirſt and deſire of the object of fayth, and mair and mair to thirſt and hunger, for the food of fayth, that nuriſhes vs to life eternall.
               Without this fayth, (howſoeuer the naturall man, and vnderſtanding natural

wald flatter thy ſelfe,) ſurely there is na bleſſednes, but all his life is mair nor terrible miſerie. For quhatſoeuer it be that flatters and pleaſes thee nowe, bee it a thought or motioun of the minde, or an action of the bodie, that pleaſes the now without fayth: the ſame verie motioun cogitatioun, and actioun, ſall torment thee efter this: Swa without faith, it is not posſible to pleaſe GOD: and quhatſoeuer pleaſes not GOD, is doone to torment thee. Therefore craue mercie, for quhatſoeuer motioun, cogitatioun, or actioun, quherein thou hes offended GOD, or bee that ſame, GOD ſall offend and torment thee: And to eſchew the offence of God, there is na moyane, but be true faith. Therefore the ſtudy of a Chriſtian ſuld be, to grow in faith. Now bee hearing of the woorde, thou gets faith, and bee receauing of this Sacrament, thou getts the increaſe of fayth: and hauing faith, the receauing of the Sacrament ſall bee fruitfull: But without faith, thou eats thine awin condem. nation. Sa, the haill ſtudie of ane Chriſtian, is to get faith; and this faith cannot be obtained with idlenes, but be earneſt

praier: Therefore lat euery ane of ȝou, fall downe, and craue earneſtlie this faith, and the increaſe of it, quhereby, ȝe may bee worthie receauers of this ſacrament, and that for the righteous merits of Chriſt Ieſus: To quhome with the Father, and the haly Spirit: be al honour, praiſe, and glory, for now and euer.
               Amen.
            
            
               
               THE FOVRT SERMON, VPON THE PREPARATION to the Lord is Supper, preached the 22. day of Feb. 1589.
               
                  
                     1. COR. 11. 28.
Let euery man therefore examine himſelf, and ſo let him eate of that breade, and drink of that cup. &c.
               
               
                  SVppoſe the doctrine of our tryal and due examination, (welbeloued in Chriſt Ieſus) ought to go before the doctrine & receauing of the Sacrament: ȝit notwithſtanding, ſeing that preparation is alwayes, at all tymes, aſwel neceſſare for the hering of the ſimple word, as for the receauing of the viſible ſacrament. (For no man can heare the word of God frutfully, except in ſom meaſure hee prepare his ſaule, and prepare the eare of his heart how to hear.) Therefore the doctrine of preparation &

dew examination mann come in the awn place, and be very neceſſare for euery ane of ȝou. The Apoſtle in the wordes that wee haue redd, interponis his counſaile, and giues his aduiſe: and not only giues his aduiſe, bot giues his admonition and command, that we ſuld not come to the Table of the Lord, that we ſuld not cum to the hearing of the worde raſhlie; but that euerie ane of vs, ſulde come to this holy work with reuerence, that we ſulde prepare, and ſanctifie our ſelues in ſome meaſure: and ſeing we go vnto the King of heauens Table, it becomes vs to put on our beſt aray: and in ane word, he takis vp the haill doctrine & matter of this preparation, quhill as he ſayis: Let euery man, and let euery woman trye and examine them ſelues, as gif he would ſay: let euery ane of ȝou trye and examine ȝour ſaules, that is, try the eſtait of ȝour awin hart, and condition of ȝour awne conſcience. Look and beholde in quhat eſtaite ȝour hart is with God, and in what eſtate ȝour conſcience is with ȝour neighbour. He bids not ȝour neighbour try ȝou, hee bids not ȝour companion try ȝour hart: but he bids ȝour ſelfe in perſon, try ȝour

awin conſcience, hee bidds ȝour ſelf trye ȝour awin hart, by reaſon nane cā be certaine of the eſtait of ȝour hart, or of the cōdition of ȝour cōſcience, but ȝour ſelf. Now he ſecludis not vthers from the triall of ȝou neither, (for it is leiſum to the Paſtour to try ȝou) but others can nocht try ȝou ſa narrowlie, as ȝe ȝour ſelf can. For na man can know ſa mekill of me, as I knaw of my ſelf: na man can be certain of the eſtait of ȝour heart, and condition of ȝour conſcience, and ȝit ȝe ȝour ſelfis may be certaine of it. As to others, men may judge of ȝour heart and conſcience, according to ȝour works and effects, and except ȝour workes and effectes, be very wicked, and altogether vitious; wee are bound in our conſcience, to judge charitablie of ȝour hart & conſcience. Therefore there is nane ſa meet to try the ſpirite of a man, to try the harte or conſcience of a man, as is the man himſelfe.
               Nowe that this tryall may goe on theThe heades to be intreated in this ſermon. better fauoredlie, ȝe haue firſt to vnderſtand, quhat it is that ȝe ſuld try, quhat ȝee call a conſcience, quhilk the Apoſtle1. commandes ȝou to trye. Secondly, ȝee haue to wey and conſidder, for what reaſons2.
                  
and cauſes ſuld ȝee try ȝour conſcience. Thridly and laſt of all, ȝee haue to ſee in what chief points, ȝe ſuld trye and examine ȝour conſcience. Then that we ſpeake not to ȝou of things vnknawne, it is neceſſare for euerye ane of ȝou (ſeeing there is nane of ȝou that lakes a conſcience) to vnderſtand what a conſcience is; and ſo nearely as God ſhall giue mee the grace, I will bring ȝou to the vnderſtanding and knawledge of a conſcience. IDefinition of conſcience, with the expoſition of the partis thairof. call a conſcience, a certain feeling in the hart, reſembling the judgement of the liuing God, following vpon ane deede done be vs, flowing from ane knawledge in the minde, accompanied with ane certaine motion in the hart, to wit; feare or joy, trembling or rejoyſing. Nowe wee ſhall examine the parts of this definition I call it firſt of all, ane certaine feeling in the hart: for the Lord hes left ſic a ſtamp in the hart of euery man, that he doeth not that turne ſo ſecretlie, nor ſo quietly but hee makes his owne heart to ſtrike him, and to ſmite him: hee makes him to feill in his owne hart, whether hee hes doone weill or ill. The Lorde hes placed this feeling in the hart; quhy? becaus the

eyes of God lookes not ſa mekill vpon the outward countenance and exteriour behauiour, as vpon the inward hart. For he ſaith to SAMVEL, in his firſt book 16. 7. verſe, The Lord behaldes the hart. Siclike 1. CHRON. 28. 9. hee ſaieth to SALOMON: The Lord ſearcheth all harts, & vnderſtandes al imaginations of thoughts. Alſo IEREMIE, 11. 20. ſayes, the Lorde tryes the reines and the hart. And the Apoſtle 1. COR. 4. 5. he ſayes, The Lorde ſhall lighten things that are hid in darkneſſe, and make the counſels of the hart manifeſt. Sa, in reſpect the Lorde makes him chieflie, to haif to do with the harte; therefore in the harte he places this feeling, quhilk is the chiefe parte of conſcience. I ſay nixt, that this feeling reſembles the judgement of God; for this feeling was left and placed in our ſaule, for this end & purpoſe, that we might haue as domeſticke and familiar judgement within our ſelfes, to ſubſcriue and reſemble the ſecreete and inuiſible judgement of the high God; a particular judgement to go before that generall judgement, in that generall and great day, quhere euerie man ſall bee juſtified or damned, according

to the particular judgement, that is within his awne conſcience. In the meane time, this conſcience is left in vs, to make out our hail proces in this life, to halde in the trauels of the liuing God, as it were, in that laſt judgement. For the bookes of our owne conſcience in that laſt day ſalbe opened, and euerye man ſall receaue according to the report of the decreet, that is within his awne conſcience; therefore I ſay, that our conſcience reſembles the judgment of God. The third thing that I ſay, is this; It follows vpon an deed doon be vs, our conſcience, nor our heart ſtrykes vs not, before the deede be done. Our hart ſtrikes vs not before the euill turne be committed: na, it goes not before the deede, but the ſtraik of the conſcience, and feeling of the heart, followis immediatly vpon the deed, in ſick ſorte, that the deede is not ſo ſoone doone be thee, but thy conſcience applyis it to thy ſelfe, and giues out the ſentence againſt thy ſelfe. Therefore I ſaye, it is a feeling following vpon ane deede done be vs. And nixt I ſaye, flowing fra ane knawledge in the minde, for except the conſcience haue information,

and except the hart knaw that the turne quhilk is done is euil, the hart, nor the conſcience, can neuer count it to bee euill. Therefore knawledge muſt go before the ſtraik of the conſcience. Thy hart can neuer feele that to be euil, quhilk thy mynde knawis not to be euill. So knawledge muſt euer go before feeling, & according to the meſure of thy knawledge, according to the nature and qualitie of thy knawledge, accordinglie ſall the teſtimonie and ſtraik of thy conſcience be. For a light knawledge, a doubting and vncertaine knawledge, makis ane light & ſmall ſtraik: as in the other part, ane haly and a ſolide knawledge drawin out of the worde of God, makis ane heauie ſtraike of the conſcience: Sa the conſcience mann anſwere to the knawledge. If wee haue na other knawledge, but the knawledge quhilk we haue by nature, & be the light and ſpoonkes that are left in nature, our conſcience will anſwere na farder, but to that knowledge. But if beſide the light of nature, we haue a knawledge of God in his worde, and a knawledge of God by his holie ſpirit working in our harts, our conſcience then will go

farder, & excuſe, or accuſe vs; according to the light that is in the worde: Sa that the conſcience is not acquired or obteined, at quhat time wee are enlightened bee the working of the halie Spirite, and hearing of the worde of God; but our conſcience is borne with vs, is natural to vs, & is left in the ſaule of euery man & woman: and as there are ſome ſpunkes of light left in nature; ſa there is an conſcience left in it. And gif there were na mair, that ſame light that is lefte in thy nature, ſal be aneugh to condemne thee. Sa the conſcience is not acquired, gotten or begun at the hearing of the worde, or at that time quhen we begin to reforme our ſelfes, be the aſsiſtance and renewing of the halie Spirite: bot euerie man bee nature hes a conſcience, and the Lorde hes left it in our nature: and except that this conſcience bee reformed according to the worde of God, that ſame naturall conſcience ſall be aneugh to condemne thee eternallie. Therefore I ſay, flowing from a knawledge of the minde. Laſt of all, I ſaye, accompanied with a certaine motion of the hart: and we expreſſe this motion, in feare or joy, trembling or rejoicing.

In very great feare gif the deed be exceeding heynous, and the ſtraik of the conſcience be very heauie: Than the conſcience takis neuer reſt, for guiltines mann euer dreed. Bot gif the deede bee honeſte, godlie, and commendable, it makis a blyth hart, and makis the harte to burſt out in joy. Sa to be ſhort in this matter, (for I purpoſe not to make ane common place of it) ȝe ſee that in euery conſcience there mann bee twa thinges: Firſt, there mann be ane knawledge, and nixt there mann be ane feeling, quherby according to thy knawledge, thou applyis to thy awin hart the deede doone be thee. Sa that, according as the word it ſelfe teſtifyes, it ryſes of twa partis, it ryſes of knawledge, according to the quhilke it is called ſcience: and it ryſes of feeling, according to the quhilk the CON is put to, & it is called conſcience. Then the woorde Conſcience ſignifyes knawledge with application.
               This conſcience the Lord hes appointed,To quhat vſes the Lord hes appointed the conſcience to ſerue in the ſaull of man. to ſerue in the ſaull of man, for manie vſes: to wit, he hes appointed euerie ane of ȝour conſciencis to be ane keeper a waiter-on, and a careful attender vpon

euerie action doone by ȝou: ſo that that action can not be ſo ſecreetlie, ſo quietly,1. nor ſo thifteouſly convoied, but nil thou, will thou, thy conſcience ſall beare ane teſtimonie of it: thy conſcience ſall bee ane faithfull obſeruer of it, and a day ſal be ane faithful recorder of that ſame action: So the Lord hes appointed thy cōſcience to this office, that it attends and waits vpō thee in al thy actions, na thing can ſlip it. Sicklike the Lord hes appointhy2. conſcience and placed it in thy ſaull, to bee ane accuſer of thee: ſo that quhen thou dois ane euill turne, thou hes ane domeſtick accuſer within thy awin ſaull to finde faulte with it. Hee hes alſo placed3. it in thy ſaull, to beare ane true and ſtedfaſt witnes againſt thee: ȝea, the teſtimony of the conſcience reſembles not onlie a teſtimonye or witnes, but the conſcience is als good, as ten thouſande witneſsis. The conſcience alſo is lefte in4. the ſaull, to do the parte of ane judge againſt thee, to giue out ſentence againſt thee, and to condemne thee; and ſo it dois▪ for our particular judgement mann ga before the generall and vniuerſall judgemēt of the Lord, at that great day.

And quhat mair? He hes left thy conſcience within thee, to put thy awin ſentence in execution againſt thy ſelfe: This is terrible: he hes left it within thee to be ane verye torture, and a burriour to thy ſelfe: and ſa to put thy awin ſentence in executioun vpon thy ſelfe. Is not this an matter mair nor woonderfull, that ane and the ſelfe ſame conſcience, ſall ſerue to ſa manie vſes in ane ſaule, as to be ane continuall obſeruer, and marker of thy actions: ane accuſer, ten thouſande witneſsis, a judge, and a burriour and tormentour, to execute thy awin ſentence againſt thy ſelf. Sa that the Lord miſters neuer to ſeeke a member of court out of thy awin ſaule, to make out a lawful proces againſt thee: but thou ſall haue all thir within thy ſelfe, to make out a full proces againſt thy ſelfe. Take heede to this, for there is neuer a word of this that ſall fall to the ground, bot ather ȝee ſall feill it to ȝour weill, or to ȝour euerlaſting woe. And this ſecreet and particuler judgement, that euery ane of ȝou caries about with ȝou; bydis ſa ſure and ſa faſt within ȝou, that doe quhat ȝe cann, gif ȝe wald imploy ȝour hail trauellis, to

blot it out, thou ſall neuer get it ſcraped out of thy ſaull: gif ȝe were als malitious and were become als wicked, as euer anie incarnate Deuill was vpon the earth, ȝe ſall neuer get this conſcience altogeather ſcraped out of ȝour ſaull: But nill thou, will thou, there ſall als mekill remaine of it, as ſal make thee inexcuſable in the great daye of the generall judgement. I graunt thou maye blot out all knawledge out of thy minde, and make thy ſelfe to becom als blinde as a modewart: I grant alſo, that thou may harden thy hart ſa, that thou wil blot out al feeling out of it, ſa that thy conſcience will not accuſe thee, nor finde faulte with thee, but thou ſall haue ane delite in ill dooing, without a remorſe: but I denye that ony gree of wickednes in the earth, ſall bring thee to that pointe, that thou may doe euill without feare: but ay the mair that thou dois euill, and the langer that thou continewis in euill dooing, thy feare ſall be the greater: ȝea, in deſpyte of the deuill, and in deſpite of all the malice of the hart of man, that feare ſall remaine: And ſuppoſe they walde baith conſpire together, it ſall not bee able to

them to baniſh that feare, but that gnawing of the conſcience ſal euer remaine: to teſtifie to thee, that there is ane day of judgement: I graunt alſo, that there ſall be ane vicisſitude, and that feare ſall not alwaies remaine, but ſall be ſome times turned ouer in ſecurity: Nather ſall that ſecurity alwayes byde, but ſall bee turned ouer again in feare: ſa that it is not poſsible to get this feare hailelie ſcraped out, but the greater that the ſecurity be, the greater ſall thy feare be, quhen thou are walkened. I grant thirdlie, that this feare ſall be blind; for fra time a man by euill doing, hes baniſhed knowledge out of the minde, and feeling out of the hart quhat can remaine there, bot a blinde feare. Quhen men hes put out all light, and lefte nathing in thair nature, but darknes; there can nathing remaine, but a blind feare: So I graunt, that the feare is blinde, for nather knawe they quhairfra the feare commis, quhat progres it

                     •

                     •
                  able: for als long as thou may keepe in

thy minde, a ſpoonke of this knawledge and ſpirituall light, in the quhilk, thou may ſee the face of God in Chriſt, quherin thou maye ſee, ane out-gaite in the death and paſsion of Chriſt, and quherein thou may ſee, the bowellis of mercye offered in the bloode of Chriſt; gif thou haue any ſpoonke of this light (albeit it were neuer ſo little) to direct thee: And albeit this knawledge, were neuer ſa euill wounded, ȝit there is mercie aneugh for thee in Chriſt. But gif thou cloſe vp all the windowes of thy ſaull, & of thy hart; & make them to become palpable darknes, that thou nather knawe, quhairfra the terrour comes, nor ȝit ſeeis onye out-gaite; that is the miſerie of all miſeries.
               Wee haue mony things to lament, we haue the eſtait of this Countrey to lament;Application they are not preſent, quhom to this doctrine ſpeciallie appertains; Alwayis there is nane of ȝou, but ȝee haue to take heed to ȝour conſciences now, quhill laiſer is giuen ȝou, that ȝee banniſh not altogither this light, quhilk is ȝit offered to ȝou, and quhereof, ſome ſponks ȝit remaines. For I ſee, the maiſt pairt of our

great men of this countrey, rūning headlongs, to baniſh the ſpoonke of light that is in thame; and they will not reſt, ſa lang as there is a ſpoonke of it left, quhil it be vtterlie banniſhed; and quhen they haue done ſa, alas quhat can folow, but a blind and terrible feare in their conſcience, quhilk they can neuer get ſcraped out. A feare without an outgait, a feare to grow and not to decay, a feare to deuour tham halelie at the laſt. Therefore, euery ane of ȝou, take heed to this light that is within ȝou, take heed that the foul affections of ȝour hearts, drawe not ȝour bodies efter thame; ſee at the leaſt, that they affections banniſh not this light, and ſa lang as the Lord offers to ȝou this light; in time craue, that of his mercy, he wald giue ȝou that grace to imbrace it, to take vp a new courſe, & ȝit to amend ȝour liues, quhill ȝee haue time.
               The bodie ſall leaue the ſaull, and the ſaull ſall leaue the bodie; but the conſcience ſall neuer leaue the ſaull; but looke quhereuer the ſaul gais, to the ſame place ſall the conſcience repair: and looke in quhat eſtait, thy cōſcience is quhen thou dies; in the ſame eſtait, ſal it meet thee in

that great day. Sa that, gif thy conſcience was a burriour to thee, in the time of thy death, gif thou gat it not pacified, in the time of thy death, it ſall be a burriour to torment thee in that general iudgement. Therefore, this matter wald be weill weyed, and euerie ane of ȝou, ſuld ſtudie to haue an good conſcience; that quhen the ſaul is ſeuered fra the bodie, leauing ȝour conſcience at reſt and peace with God, it may bee reſtored to ȝou, and meet ȝou againe, with als great peace and quietnes. This far concerning conſcience; quhat it is. I pray the liuing Lorde, ſa to ſanctifie ȝour memories, that ȝee may keepe thir things, and that euery ane of thir things, may ſa ſticke with ȝou in ſome meaſure, that to the ende of ȝour life, ȝee may remember vpon thame.
               The ſecond thing that wee haue to ſpeake off, is this; we haue to try & conſider, wherfore we ſuld examin our conſcience; for what cauſes ſuld a man or womā bee mooued to try thair awin conſcience and ſaull: I ſall take vp the reaſons ſhortlie. It becomes euery ane of ȝou, to trie ȝour conſcience; quhy? Becauſe the Lord will make his reſidence in na vther pairt

of the ſaull, but in the conſcience: he hes appointed his dwelling to be in the hart of man, and into the will and conſcience of man: and therefore, it becomes ȝou, to make his dwelling place cleane, and to take heede to ȝour heart. Nixt, ſuppoſe the Lorde of heauen made not reſidence there; ȝit, in reſpect the eie of God is ane all-ſeeing eie, and able to pearce thorow the very thicknes of the fleſh of man, how darke and groſſe ſoeuer it be, & to pearce thorow the very ſecret hirnes of thy conſcience (for vnto the al-ſeeing eie of God, the maiſt ſecreet hirne of the conſcience, is als patent, cleare and manifeſt; as onie outwarde, or bodilie thing in the earth can bee to the outward eie of the bodie.) In reſpect therefore, that his eie is ſa percing, and that he caſts his eie onely vpon our heart; it becomes vs to try our harts. Thirdly, he is the Lord of the conſcience; There is not a Monarch of the earth, that hes ony ſoueranitie or lordſhip ouer the conſcience; onely the God of heauen, onlie Chriſt Ieſus, King of heauen & earth, is Lord of the conſcience; hee hes power onely to ſaue and tine: Therefore, quhen thou dreſſes thee to this Lords Table; becomes

it thee not to looke vpon thy conſcience, to trie thy conſcience, and to examine the eſtait of it? Laſt of all, quhilk is ane of my chiefeſt reaſons; it becomes thee to trie and examine thy conſcience; quhy? Becauſe the welfare and health of thy ſaull, dependes vpon thy conſcience; gif thy conſcience that is within thy ſaull be weil, gif it be at peace and reſt, thy ſaul is weill; gif thy conſcience be in an good eſtait, thy ſaull mann bee in ane good eſtait; gif thy conſcience be in good helth; of necesſitie, thy ſaull mann bee in good health: For the good health and weill of the ſaull, depends vpon ane good conſcience: Therefore it becomes euerie ane of ȝou, to try weill ȝour conſcience. There is not a law that ever was ſet down or deuiſed; but of all the lawes that euer was made, it is leifsom to vs, to haue a care of our health, it is leifsome to vs, to ſeeke ſic things as may procure our helth, preſerue & entertain our helth; Now ſubſume: but the helth of thy ſaull, ſtands in the health of thy conſcience, & in preſeruiug thereof: Therfore be al laws, thou aught to attend to thy conſcience; gif thou keep thy conſcience weill, thy ſaul is in health; and

gif thy ſaul be in health; lat troubles com quhat wil vpon the bodie, thou wilt bear thame out all: But gif thy ſaull be diſeaſed, & gif that dwining ſiknes occupy thy ſaull, quhilk ane euill conſcience brin gs on, thou ſalt not be able to beare out the leaſt trouble, that can come vpon the bodie: quhere as, gif the conſcience were at reſt, & in good health; that trouble could not light vpon thy bodie, but the ſtrēgth of ane good conſcience, ſuld beare it out. Then haue ȝee not reaſon, and mair nor reaſoun, to take tent to ȝour conſcience, to examine and trye ȝour conſcience, in quhat eſtait and diſpoſition it is.
               Now, becauſe it is ane ſauourles jeſt toCertaine leſſons to b
                        •
                      learned, quhair throw a man may preſerue health in his conſcience and ſaule. tell ȝou, that health is neceſſare, and not to open vp the way, how this health may be acquired, preſerued, and intertained, Therefore, to keepe ȝour conſcience in quietnes, and in good health; I ſall giue ȝou thir few leſſons. Firſt of all tak heed, that ȝe kepe faſt, a perſwaſion of the mercie of God in Chriſt Ieſus; examin quhen thou lies down, and examin quhen thou riſes vppe, in quhat eſtait thou art with God; quhither thou may looke ſurely for mercie at his hand or not: art thou perſwaded

of mercie; aſſure thy ſelf, thy conſcience is at ane good point, thou hes health in thy ſaul, for be keeping of faith the conſcience is preſerued, as ſayis the Apoſtle, 1. TIMOTH. 1. 19. Keep this perſwaſion, halde it haill and ſound, hurt it not, bring not thy ſaul in doubting ſa far as thou may, ſtay not, nor hinder not thy perſwaſion, gif thou walde keepe health in thy ſaull: for gif thou doubt, or in onye wayes diminiſh thy perſwaſion, and aſſurance, aſſuredlye thy aſſurance cannot ſo ſone be hindered, nor diminiſhed; bot in that ſame article of time, ſall follow, the diminiſhing of the health of thy ſaull: Ȝea, it cannot be, but in that ſame article of time, followes the hurt of thy conſcience, for faith will not dwell, bot in ane haill conſcience. Thairfore in quhat article of tyme thou dois againſt thy conſcience, in that ſame article of time thou loſes ane gree of thy perſwaſion of the mercy of God: and vnto the time that thou fall downe at the feete of Chriſt, & obtein mercy for that ill deed, purchaſe peace at his handes, to repaire thy perſwaſion; thou ſall euer doubte of mercie, and want healthe in thy conſcience.

Then this is the firſt leſſon, to keep health in ȝour ſaulles, look and ſee, that ȝe be perſwaded of mercy.
               The ſecond leſſoun to keepe a good conſcience, or to keepe health in thy ſaul is this: Ȝee mann flee, eſchewe, and forbeare quhatſoeuer may trouble the helth of ȝour ſaull, quhatſoeuer may trouble the quietnes & peaceable eſtait of ȝour conſcience: Caſt it out, forbeare it, and eſchewe it. This generall is good: but quhat is it, lat ſee, that troubles the quiet eſtait of the conſcience? Nathing in the warld but ſinne, nathing in the earth, but an euill nature: Therefore, wee mann of force, to keepe health in our ſaulle; forbeare and eſchew ſinne, we mann flee ſin, and rid our hand of it. It is not posſible, that ȝee can baith keepe a good conſcience, and ſerue the affections of ȝour heart: and therefore, to keepe peace and health in thy ſaull; thou mann bidd thy luſtes goodnight: thou mann renounce the luſts and affections of thy heart, and thou mann not doe, as thou was woont to doe: thou mann not bee giuen to the ſeruice of thine affections, and of thine appetite, to put thame in executioun as

thou woont to doe: but incaſe, thine affection or luſt, commaund thee to doe onie thing; quhat is thy part? Thou mann try, howe farre this may ſtande with the good will of God, and how far that affection quhilk commands thee, may agree with the law of God. Is there ſic an harmony, that that, quhilk thine affectioun commaunds thee, may ſtand with Gods law and halie will? Na queſtion, it is ane ſanctified affection; thou may put it in execution. But efter this triall, gif thou find thine affection to be exorbitant, and out of rule, carying thee plat fra God, and agains his lawe: Beware of it, reſiſt it: beware, that thou put not the will of it in executioun. Or vtherway is, gif thou fulfill the will of that affectioun ane hour, quhat pleaſure can that bring with it? It may weill bring with it, a flattering pleaſure in the entrie: but it cloſes euer with a bitter remorſe in the ende. Then to eſchew this bitter remorſe, ſuld ȝee not all trie ȝour affections? Ȝee mann examine and try tham, be the ſquare of Gods law, ȝe mann ſee, how far they agree with his law, or how far they diſaſſent from it: and in ſa far as, they diſaſſent fra that law: lat

euery man denie himſelfe, renounce his affections; and ſwa, this triall being tane this way be thy ſelfe, it ſanctifies thine affections, makes Chriſt to ludge in thy ſaull, makes thy conſcience to be at reſt, and the halie ſpirite this way, maks baith bodie and ſaull, to be in good health, and to reioyce. Then flie fra ſin: This is the ſecond leſſon.
               The third leſſon is this, Studie to doe well: Walde thou keepe healthe in thy ſaull; ſtudie to do better and better continuallie: At leaſt, haue a purpoſe in thy ſaull and hart, to take vp a better courſe dailie. Quhilk is the laſt leſſon? Seeing that quhen wee ſtudie to doe beſt, and that the iuſt man, that is, the maiſt halie man, fallis ſa oft in the daye, as ſeauen tymes in the daye: ȝea rather, ſeuentye tymes ſeauen tymes, quhat is thy parte in thir ſlippes, and ſnappers? Suppoſe thou fall, as thou can not eſchew to fall, ly not ſtill there: ſleep not there quhere thou hes fallen: It is a ſhame to ſleepe there, therefore, ryſe againe: And how ſould thou ryſe? Be lifting vp thy ſaull, and running to the fountaine of grace & mercie: bee running to Chriſt Ieſus to ſeeke

to be for a day, or for a ȝear: but it aught to bee euery day, and euery ȝeare of thy haill lifetime. For that conſcience, that ſuld reſt for euer, with the liuing GOD, that conſcience, quhilk mann euer looke vpon the face of the Sonn of God: It can not be ouer wel ſcowred, we cannot look ouer narrowly to it: the mair curious we be in ſearching out of this conſcience, we are the better occupied: I ſpeake of our awn conſcience, I ſpeak not of our neighbours.
               I ga to the third, and I come to the points quhairintill, euerie an of ȝou, ſuldIn quhat points wee ſuld examin our conſcience. trie and examine ȝour ſelfis. I giue ȝou twa points; quhairintil, euery ane of ȝou, aught to try and examine ȝour conſciences. Try thy conſcience firſt in this point; quhither thou be at peace with God, quha is the Lorde of heauen, or not: Nixt, trie thy conſcience in this point: quhither thou be in loue & amitie with thy neighbour, or not. Wald thou knaw, quhither thy conſcience, bee at vnitie and peace with God, or not? thou ſall knawe it this way. The God of heauen, hee cann haue na ſocietie, nor can keepe na companie, with that ſaull, quhilk is alwayis vnclean,

that is euery way defiled: na, he cannot. Now I ſpeake not ſa preciſely, that I mak a ſaull to be fullie ſanctified, and perfectlie halie in this life. Na, in this life, there is wonderful iniquities, groſſe ſinnes, and great faults, quherewith, euen the righteous ar defiled: But this is my meaning; There is na ſaull, cann bee at peace with God, or quherewith the Lorde can haue ony ſocietie, but in ſome meaſure, it man be ſanctified, and made halie: for GOD cannot make reſidence in a ſaull, that is a ſtincking midding alway: and therefore on force, in ſome meaſure it man be ſanctified; there mann be ſa meekle made cleane, in ane nuke or vther of that ſaule, quherein the Lord of heauen, be his halie ſpirit may make his reſidence. Nowe lat ſee, quhereby is the ſaule ſanctified? PETER Acts 15. 9. ſayis, that the ſaull of man is purified be faith; that the heart of man is purged bee faith. Sa faith opins and purges the heart: bee faith in Chriſt Ieſus, and in the merites of his blood, we haue peace with God. Being iuſtified be faith, wee haue peace towards God, thorough our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, ſayis the Apoſtle, ROM. 5. 1. Nowe comes in this

point, ȝe haue to proue ȝour ſelfs, quhither ȝee bee in the faith or not, as the Apoſtle ſayis. 2. COR. 13. 5. Trie and ſee, quhither ȝee haue faith in Chriſt or not. Examine, gif ȝour ſaull be ſeaſoned with this faith: for gif ȝee haue not faith in Chriſt; Chriſt is not in ȝou: and gif Chriſt be not in ȝou, ȝee are in ane euil eſtait, ȝe are in the eſtait of the reprobat and damned. Sa, euery ane aught to looke carefullie, and ſee, gif hee hes a beliefe in the blood of Chriſt or not: quhither hee beleeues to get mercie bee his merites, and ſanctificatioun be his blood or not: For gif thou haue na meaſure of this fayth, thou hes na meaſure of peace with God: Be reaſon, our peace with God, is ingendered, and grows daily mair and mair be true faith in Chriſt. Now this faith, quher it is true, quhere it is liuelie, and couples the heart with God, as I haue ſpoken; it mann breake out in worde and deed: It cannot be halden in, but it mann breake out. It mann breake out in word, in glorifying the God of heauen, quha hes forgiuen vs our ſins: It mann breake out in word, be giuing a notable confesſion of they ſinnes, quherein we haue offended

him. It mann breake out in deed, in doing good workes, to teſtifie to the warld that thing, quhilk is within thy heart: to teſtifie to the warld, that thou, quha hes this faith, art ane new man; that bee thy good example of life and conuerſatioun, thou may edifie thy brethren, the ſimple anis of the Kirke of GOD: and that bee thine halie life, thou may draw ſinners to repentaunce, that they ſeeing thy light, they may bee compelled to glorifie God in thee. Then in the firſt point of triall, lat vs looke to thir three; to the heart, to the mouth, and to the hand: Take heed, that there be ane harmonie, betwixt thir three, and that they all ſing ane ſang: for gif the heart, bee inwardly coupled with God; there is na doubt, but the mouth wil outwardly glorifie him: and gif thine hart and mouth be renewed, and be ane: of necesſitie, thou mann vtter this, in thy conuerſatioun: There mann bee agreement betwixt the hart, and the hand: thy conuerſation mann be changed with the heart, and be halie, honeſt and godly, as the heart is: Swa that, gif thy conuerſaſion be good; it is a ſure taken, that thou art at ane with God: but gif thy conuerſation

be not good; lat men ſpeake quhat they wil, the hart is but defiled: this true and liuely faith, hes na place in it. Then will thou ſpeare, quhen art thou at ane with God? Quhen thy conuerſatioun, thine hart, and thine mouth ſayis all ane thing; then na queſtioun, thou hes the warke of fayth, wrought be the halie Spirit in thy heart, quhilk makes thee to bee at peace with God. This is the firſt point, quherein ȝee ſuld trie ȝour ſelfs.
               The nixt point is loue; ȝee mann trie, quhither ȝee be in loue, and vnder charitie with ȝour neighbour or not: For as thou art not coupled with God, but bee the band of faith: ſa thou art not coupled with thy neighbor, nor joyned with na member of Chriſt in this earth, but be the band of loue, amitie, and charity. Tak away loue, thou art not a member of this bodie: For loue is the maiſter ſennoun, that couples all thir members of Chriſts body togither, & maks tham to grow vp all in a ſpirituall and miſtical vnitie. Loue is the onelie marke, quhereby the children of Chriſt, and members of Chriſtes bodie, are knawen from the reſt of the warlde. Loue is that halie oyle, that refreſhes

our ſaules, and makes vs like vnto God: and the mair wee growe in loue, the mair God be his ſpirit dwels in vs; for God is loue. Sa that, except in ſome meaſure, loue towardes thy neighbour dwell in thy hart, thou can haue na ſociety with thy neighbour, and far leſſe with GOD. Gif the manners of men were examined be this rule; wee ſuld find a multitude of godles people in this Country, quha hes their hearts raging with malice, ilke ane againſt vthers: and quhere the Deuill, and a malitious ſpirite dwels; there is na place there for the haly ſpirit: & now ſuppoſe the Lord hes gan about, be al means posſible, late and air, to inſtruct thame, and to infound in thame, this precious loue and amitie towardes God and their neighbour, and ſa to alter their condition: Ȝit they will not ſuffer thame ſelfis to bee walkned, quhill the great vengeance and malediction of GOD, light on their carcaſes. Alwayis this loue, this honeſt and godly conuerſation, flows all fra the root of faith: ſa that, gif thy hart haue faith, in any meaſure; and it were neuer ſa ſmall; in that ſame meaſure, thou man haue loue towardes thy neighbour: and

this loue is neuer idle, but it is euer vttering the ſelfe; ather in ane effect, or vther: And in reſpect faith is the ground, quherevpon all the reſt dependes, and in reſpect, that this faith, is ſick a jewell, as without the quhilk, it is not posſible to onie of ȝou, to pleaſe God; without the quhilk, al ȝour doings are abhomination before him; without the quhilk, ȝee are left in a terrible miſerie: quhilk miſerie, is ſa meekle the mair terrible, that ȝe are ignorant of it: Is it not good reaſon, that we knaw and vnderſtand, how this fayth is wrought and created in our ſaules bee the halie Spirite, and howe it is intertayned and nuriſhed in our ſaules: That ſeeing how it is created, and hearing tel the maner, how it is brought about; ȝe may examine ȝour conſciences, and ſee quhither ȝee bee in the faith or not. My purpoſe was to haue inſiſted langer in this matter, nor this time will ſuffer. Nowe therefore, as time will ſuffer, and as God will giue the grace, I ſall lat ȝou vnderſtand, how the halie Spirite imployes his trauaile, in the heart and mind of man & woman; and quhat pains he taks in creating and making vp this jewel of faith in

their ſauls. Ȝit or I enter to this wark, to lat ȝou ſee the trauaills of the ſpirit of God, in working of this faith in ȝour harts: It is neceſſare, and mair nor neceſſare, that ȝee vnderſtand firſt, ȝour awin miſerie and infirmitie: and that ȝe knaw how the Lorde was induced, to recouer ȝou out of ȝour auld eſtait, & to recreat ȝou, quha were loſt be the deede of ȝour fore-father ADAM.
               Then to take vp the matter the mair highlie, I call to ȝour memories thisThe myſt of mans nation in ſome me ſure diſc ſed. ground: That man vniuerſallie, and euery ane particularie beeing corrupted, being loſt, and that be his firſt forebears faulte: (For gif there were na mair but that ſame firſt fault and ſinne of his, wee are all juſtlie obliſhed and bound to ane double death, baith of body and ſaul for ever.) Man, this way vniuerſally and particularlie, being vtterly loſt, without any hope of regres left in his ſaull, without ony ſenſe of the recouerie of that for mer eſtaite, or reparing of that image quhilke hee had tint throw ſinne lang of before: he being loſt be this ſinne, and lefte in this deſperate eſtait in him ſelfe, quhat dois God? The euerliuing God,

God, onlye wiſe; quhais wayes are vnſearchable, hes found out ane waye, how that man this way loſt; ȝit hee may bee ſaued. In this turne, he ſoght counſaill, quhome at? Not at any creature: but he ſought counſaill at him ſelf: the perſons of the Trinitie, ſought counſaill at them ſelfis: ea God was moued to ſeeke counſaill at him ſelf, onlie moued in him ſelf: for he had not ane externall principall outwith him ſelf, to induce him. Swa he ſeeking this counſell at him ſelfe, and beeing mooued in him ſelfe thereto: AS EPHES. 1. 9. quhat dois hee? Quhen all men and women ſulde haue died for euer, it pleaſis him of his infinite mercie to ſelect out of all, and to elect a certaine number out of the loſte race of ADAM, that ſuld haue periſhed for euer. In this his counſail and decreet, moued I ſay of him ſelf, and ſeeking counſaill at himſelf onlie, he ſelectes a certaine number out of this rotten race: quhilke certaine, he will haue ſanctified, he will haue juſtified, he will haue glorified. And therefore to bring about the work of their ſaluation, quhat dois hee? He appointes his awin naturall ſonne (for he had but ane naturall

ſonne,) he appointes the ſecond perſon of the Trinitie, his awin naturall Son, God in power, glorie, and Majeſtie, als high as him ſelfe: aequall with God the Father in all things; he appoints him to work this warke, to bring about this wark of our redemption and aeternal ſaluation: (this is but the myſterye of it in ſome meaſure diſcloſed.) And therefore in the fulnes of tyme (for he diſpenſis all times according to his wiſedome,) at ſik tyme as he appointed, he maks his ſonne to come downe, to ſeaſe him ſelfe in the wemb of the virgin, to take on our fleſh, to take on the likenes of ſinne, he tooke not on ſinne, but he took on the likenes of ſinne. Quhat call I that likenes? our fleſh is the likenes of ſinne: hee took on our fleſh and nature, the lyknes of ſinne, quhilk wes perfitelie ſanctified, in the verie moment of his conception, in the verie wembe of the virgine: Hee tooke on this fleſh, that in this fleſh and nature, ſin might be baniſht and dung out of vs for euer. And quhere we ſuld all haue gane ea gaite, (for there was na exception of perſons be nature;) Chriſt Ieſus our Saueour, hes elected vs: and according as

his Father in his ſecreet election, before the beginning of the worlde, had elected vs: the ſame Chriſt Ieſus in his awin time hee callis vs, hee makis vs pertakers of that ſaluation, quhilk he hes purchaſed: and hee repairis not onlye that Image quhilk was loſt in our fore-father ADAM, he places vs not in a terreſtriall paradiſe, quhere ADAM was placed at the beginning, (and quhat mair could haue bene ſought be vs?) but he giues vs a far mair excellent image, nor we loſt: he places vs in a mair high, and in a mair coeleſtial Paradiſe nor wee loſt. For, ſa meekill the mair heauenlie is the paradiſe quhilk hee giues vs, as the ſecond ADAM is mair excellent nor the firſt: and as the Son of God, and God him ſelfe, gais far aboue any creature that euer was; man, or Angell. Therefore it comes to pas, that be the benefite of the ſecond ADAM, Chriſt Ieſus our Sauiour, the Sonne of God; quhereas, gif we had remained in that Image quherein our fore-father was firſt created: wee ſuld haue ſetled our ſelfis in the earth for euer, we culd not haue craued a better Paradiſe, nor ane earthlye Paradiſe for earthly tabernacles. Be the

benefite of the Sonne of God, I ſaye, it comes to pas, that we are plucked vp out of the earth to the heauen, and to ane heauenly paradiſe. And quhat haue we to do with heauen? Are we not made of the earth, to returne to the earth? becoms not ane earthlye paradiſe, ane earthly body? Ȝit the Lord in his mercy ſendis downe his Sonne, to draw vs vp out of the earth to the heauen: This is ſa high a thing, that it cannot be eaſily cō
                  ſidered: For this drawing of vs to ane heauenlie paradiſe, is a thing mair nor coulde haue beene thought of, that wee ſuld liue ane Angels life in heauen: how could the hart of man think on this? ȝit it pleaſed the leuing Lord in the great riches and bowels of his mercie, and in the exceeding greatnes of the power of his mercie towards vs: (The Apoſtle in that Epiſtle to the EPHESIANS, can not get words anew to expreſſe this; hee knawes not how to begin, nor how to end: quhā he ſpeakes of the riches of that mercye. And gif ȝe look that Epiſtle to the EPHESIANS narrowlie, ȝe ſall finde maa high, and excellent ſtiles, giuen to the riches of that mercie, in that Epiſtle, nor in ony

other parte of the ſcripture.) It pleaſed him, I ſay, of his awin mercy, not to giue vs ſimply the Image quhilk we loſt, nor to leaue vs in this earth: but it pleaſed him to giue vs, a better image: and beſide that, to place vs in heauen, to byde with him for euer.
               Now, reſtes his mercy and grace heir? Na: But that this ſaluation quhilk hee hes alreadye purchaſed, and brought about, be his Sonne our Sauiour Chriſt Ieſus, that it might bee alwaies accompliſhed, hauing nathing lacking in it: As he redeemed vs in his awin perſon perfitlie: Swa, he makes this ſame redemptioun, to come to our knawledge, and makes vs ſure of it in our owne conſciences; and to this ende, quhat dois hee I praye ȝou? As he be his death purchaſed our ful redemption: ſa he maks it knawin to vs: hee intimates it to vs, bee our inwarde calling: letting vs baith finde and feele in our heart, quhat hee did in his bodie for vs: For our Lord▪ quhen he maks his ſeruants to proclaime this redemption, and to intimate it to our conſciencis: he workis this jewell of faith in our ſaulls, quhilk aſſures vs, that the Sonn of

God hes died for vs: For quhat coulde it auaile vs, to ſee our redemption, to ſee our ſaluation and our life a farre of, gif a way wer not founde out, and a hande, & a moyan giuen vs, quhereby we may apprehend that ſaluation, & apply it to our ſelf. Quhat can it avail a ſick man, to ſee a drog in ane Apothicaries booth, except a way be found out, how it ſall be applied to his ſick bodie: Swa, to the end that this worke of our redemption and ſaluation, may bee fullie and freely accompliſhed: Look how freelie hee hes giuen his onely Sonn, to the death of the Cros for vs: als freelie hes he founde out this way & moyen, & propyned vs with this hand quhereby we may take hald on Chriſt, & apply him to our ſaulls. This moyan, to conclude, is faith. There is not a waye, nor ane inſtrument in the Scriptures of God, quhereby ony man or woman, may apply Chriſt to thair ſaulls, but only the inſtrument of faith: therefore faith cannot bee aneugh commended. Turne to faith, and it will make thee to turne to God, and ſwa conjoine thee with God, and make all thine actions to ſmell weill in his neaſe: And there is neuer a good

actiō that we do, ſuppoſe it glaūce neuer ſa weill before the warlde, gif it bee not done in faith, but it is abhomination before God, & will help foreward to our dānation: Hauing faith, all the creatures of God mann laugh on vs; they mann all conſpire to the furtherance of the worke of our ſaluation: As be the contrare, lacking faith, there is neuer ane of the creatures of God, but they ſall be enemies to vs, and conſpire to our damnatioun. For faith conjoynis vs with the GOD of heauen, and makis vs heauenlye. This jewell of faith, ſeaſons all the giftes and graces quhilk God giues vs. I will not giue a ſtraw, for all the riches of the earth to my ſaull, without faith. And quhat auailes it to ony man, to haue all the ſciences, wiſedome, and knawledge in the earth, without faith? for the deuil hes all this knawledge; and is not the better. Quhat auaillis it to me, to conques all the Monarches, Kingdomes, & haill riches in the earth? quhat can all thir auaill to my ſaull? Na thing; but to make out a proces againſt mee, gif I want faith. Therefore all the benefites and giftes of God, without faith; auailes

nathing, but to augment our miſery. All the giftes and graces of God, are abuſed without faith: Faith onlie makes thee to vſe the benefits & graces of God rightly: faith onlie ſuld bee ſought, keeped, and interteined heir in this life: hauing faith, all the reſt of Gods graces are profitable to thee: for this jewell keeps them all in order, and makes them al fruitful: quhere, lacking this jewell, there is nathing heir in this earth, but it will beare teſtimonie againſt thee.
               Then let vs come to ſpeake ȝit of thisHow faith is created i
                        •
                      our ſauls. faith, how it is created in euery e ane of ȝour ſauls. I take my ground out of the Euangeliſt IOHN, 6. 44. quhere our maiſter ſayis: Na man can come to mee, except the Father quhilk hath ſent mee, drawe him. Into the quhilk words, we ſee cleaerlie, that except we be drawne, except we be compelled, except wee bee rugged, except of vnwilling we be made willing, be God the Father; it is not poſſible for vs to come to his Sonne. Quhat is the reaſon of this, that the ſpirite of God mann draw vs, and make vs willing or euer we come to God? Becaus be nature, we are not onlie wounded and lanced

be ſinne and iniquitie; but as the Apoſtle ſhawis EPHES. 2. 1. We were halilie dead in treſpaſsis and ſinnes. Ȝea, farder looke, howe voide any carcaſe is of a naturall life, als voide ar our ſauls (ſuppoſe they be liuand the naturall life) als voide are they of the life of God, of that heauenlie and ſpirituall life, quhereunto we in this life doe aſpire: vnto the tyme that the ſpirit of God draw our harts & mindis, that is; quicken our hartes and mindis. Nay, it is not a draught as wee take it commonlie, it is a verye quickening of a dead thing: It is a quickening of that thing quhilk was voide of the life of the ſpirite. Then, except the ſpirit of God drawe vs, that is, quicken vs with that ſpirituall & heauenlie life: it is not poſſible to vs to come to heauen. And except hee nouriſh this life, quhilk hee hes begunne, it is not poſſible that wee can ſtand in this life. Swa, the ſpirit of God is ſaid to drawe vs, that is, to begin this life in vs, and be the ſame halie Spirit to continue & nouriſh this life in vs. Now be the draught of the ſpirit, our ſauls ar quickened: and bee the drawing of the ſpirite, I vnderſtand na other thing, but

the forging and creating of faith in our ſauls, quhilk makis vs newe creaturs. Lat vs ſee now, quhat order the ſpirit of God keepis in drawing vs, and in forging and creating this faith in our ſauls. Firſt of al, I deuide the ſaull in na ma parts, nor commonlie it vſis to be deuided: that is, in the hart and in the minde. Our mind then being ane clud of darknes, altogether blinde naturallie: there beeing nathing in that mind of ours, but vanity & error, quherby we vaniſh away, & can neuer bide at na good purpoſe: quhat dois the ſpirit of God? The firſt work that euer the ſpirit of God dois, he takis order with the mind: and quhat dois he to the mynde? He banniſhis darcknes, he chaiſſes out vanitie and blindnes, that naturally lurkes in the minde: and in ſtead of this darcknes, he places in the mynde, a light▪ a coeleſtiall and a heauenlie light, a light quhilk is reſident in Chriſt Ieſus onlie. Then the ſpirite chaiſſes out that clud of miſte and darcknes, and places light in the mynde. And quhat dois hee be this light? Wee getting this inward and heauenlie light in the mind, and ane ſanctified vnderſtanding; incontinent he

makis vs to ſee God: not onlie, as hee is God the creator of the warld: but alſwa, as hee is God the redeemer, and hes redeemed vs in his Son Chriſt Ieſus. Now before I get this light, quhat is my heart and mynde dooing? There is neuer ane of ȝou, but ȝee haue experience, as I my ſelfe haue, in quhat eſtait the heart and minde is before this light enter. The mynde is lyand drowned in blindnes, & the hart is hardned, and they baith conſpire together in ane vice, to ſet vp ane Idoll in ſteed of God: ane domeſtick & inuiſible idoll, & quhat a ſort of idol is that I pray ȝou? Na doubt, an warldly or fleſhly affectiō, ane or vther: this is ſet vp in the throne of thy hart: And on this idol, thou beſtows the ſeruice of thy hail hart, of thy hail minde, of thy haill ſaull & bodie: Sa, that the ſeruice, baith of ſaul and bodie, quhilk ſuld be beſtowed vpō God onlie, is imployed vpō that idoll, quhilk is ſet vp in thy hart, that is, in the place of God, in the ſteede of the maiſt high God: And thou art mair addicted to the ſeruice of that idol, nor euer thou wes to the ſeruice of the liuing God. Ȝea, vnto the tyme that this Idol of ours be baniſhed,

& that this blindnes, quherthrow this idoll is ſerued, be tane away; there is not ane of ȝou, but ȝe are ſeruant to ane luſt or vther: & thy ſaul that ſuld be conſecrat to the ſeruice of the liuing God, it is imployed vpō ane affectiō or vther: vpō ane warldly or fleſhly luſt of thin awin But now, fra time the Lord begin to ſcatter the cluds of our natural minds & vnderſtāding: & begin to chaſe away this thick miſt of the dark ſaull; & places therin a ſponk of heuenly light, quhilk flowis out of Chriſt: And quhere we were children of the night and darknes of before, he makes vs to be light in the Lord, and to bee children of the light, and of the day. Then wee ſee, that all the things in the warld, beſide the liuing God, are vanities, deceaueable allurements, vnconſtant ſhaddowes, fleetand and flowand without ony byding: and then wee ſee that our hartes and mindes was ſet on ill continuallie. Then wee begin to abhor that Idoll, and to ſeek to ſerue God onlie. Now except the Lord of his awin mercy & goodnes, place in vs this light, vnto the tyme that we get ſome glimmering of this light, wee can neuer ſee our

awin vanitie, lat bee to ſee God. This then is the firſt warke of the Spirit, hee banniſhes darcknes and errors, and places light in our mindis. Nowe, this firſt wark of the Spirite, is termed oftymes in the Scripture, vnder the name of faith: for the minde hes the awin aſſent & perſwaſion in the awin kynde, als weill as the hart hes: and therefore the mind being illuminat & ſeaſoned with this light, the aſſenting and knawledge in the ſame minde, is called faith. The Apoſtle, and the Euangeliſts giues to this knawledge, the name of faith: for fra time ains thou haue ane eie to ken God, and quhom he hes ſent Chriſt Ieſus, fra ains thou get a ſight of him, and gets acceſſe to him, gif it wer na farder nor in the mind, it is called faith.
               But we are forbidden to ſtand heir, gif faith ga na farder nor the minde, it is not the faith wee are ſeekand. For the Faith that juſtifies, and dois vs good, mann oppin the heart, als weill as it oppinnis the minde: it mann banniſh that idol and affection, out of the hart, and in his ſteed, ſet down a Throne to Chriſt Ieſus. Sa that, except the good Spirite of

God ga farder, nor rhe mynde; and banniſh this idol, als weil out of our harts, as out of our minds, we get not that juſtifiing faith, quhereby wee may looke for mercie. Ȝea, the Spirit of God mann not onlie ſtand in lightening the minde: but it mann mollifie this hart of thine, and change thine affection: And quhere thy affection was wicked and ill, Gods Spirit mann change the will: and hee neuer can change the will, except he make the ground of thy hart good: that it may be ſet on God, and bring foorth good frute aboundantlie to the awner. And quhat teaches this? This teaches ȝou to ſeeke, for ane honeſt hart, and to ſeeke inſtantly, quhil ȝe obteene it. For quhat auails it to ony man to ken quhat is good, or quhat is ill, except he haue a way ſhawin him, how hee ſall eſchew the ill, and a moyan giuen him to make him ſelfe pertaker of the good? Is not this ane idle and vnprofitable knawledge to mee, to ſee a far off: and to ken, that this is good for mee, quhen as I finde not a moyan how to be pertaker of that good, that it may be ane ſpeciall good thing to mee. Is it not ane idle knawledge alſo, to ken

that this is ill for mee, that it wil do mee ill gif I doe it: and ȝit that ſame verye thing I will do; and na vther? Swa, the Spirit of God linckes thir twa together in this warke: and as he reformes the minde, hee reformes alſo the heart, and makes ȝou to be pertakers of that good quhilke ȝou ſee, and to eſchewe that ill quhilk ȝee ſee. And this is the ſecond warke of the Spirit, not onlie to preſent a thing to thee, but to make it thine in effect. For, howbeit the minde wald do hir turne neuer ſa weill, and lat thee ſee that Chriſt is thine; and preſent him to thee, neuer ſa oft; gif the hart be not reformed, that wil, and cruked affection that is in thy heart, will prefer it ſelfe to Chriſt, and will make thee to compt all but follie, in reſpect of that Idoll. And therefore it were ane idle and ane fooliſh thing for mee to ſee my ſaluation, except I get grace to be pertaker of it: & quhat auailes it to thee to ſee the Diuel, to ſee thine awin ſins that ſlayes thee, except thou get grace to eſchew tham: & ſa the ſecond wark of the ſpirit is this; he enters in the heart, he dantons the hart, & wō
                  derfully chāges it, & makes the will of it

obediēt; he mollifies the affection, quhilk was hard of before, in ſic ſort, that it is made to poure out thy affection in ſome meaſure on the liuing GOD, quhere it was powred out on ane idoll or vther of thine awin before. Then except the hart wil do his part, as the mind dois his part; the haill ſaull is not conſecrate to God: for God hes not made the ſaull, that the heart ſuld ſerue thee, and the minde onely ſuld ſerue him: but thy ſeruice is then onelie acceptable to GOD, quhen thou conſecrates thy hart, as weill as thy mind to him.
               Now this mater is ſa cleare, that it miſters not to be illuſtrat be ſimilitude: ȜitA ſimilitude of the app
                        •
                     e henſion of the corporal food, to illuſtrat the ſpirituall▪
                   to make it mair cleare vnto ȝou, we ſal lat ȝou ſee bee a ſimilitude, that the apprehēſion of the mind is not aneugh, except ȝee get the apprehenſion of the heart alſo. In corporall things, in meat and drink that ſerues for the vſe of ȝour bodies; there mann bee of this meat and drinke, twa ſort of apprehenſions; and as there is twa ſort of apprehenſions, of the meat and drinke, that is the food of the bodie; ſwa, there is twa ſort of apprehenſions, of the bodie & blood of Chriſt Ieſus, quhilk

is our meat and drinke ſpiritual. Of meat and drinke corporall, there is ane apprehenſion bee the eie, and be the taiſt: that quhil as the meat is preſent to ȝou on the table, ȝour eie takes a view of this meat, diſcernes on it, and makes a choyce of it; Ȝea, not onelie the eie, but alſo the taiſt, diſcernes on that meat, and the taiſt approouing it; that is called the firſt apprehenſion.
               Now vpon this, quhilk is the firſt, the ſecond apprehenſion followes: that is, efter that ȝe haue chewed that meat, letten it ouer ȝour halſe, and ſend it to ȝour ſtomachs, quhere it digeſts, and conuerts in ȝour nuriture: Then in ȝour ſtomach, ȝee get the ſecond apprehenſion. But gif ſwa bee, that ȝour eie like not of that meat, & that ȝour taiſt like not of it nather; the ſecond apprehenſioun followes not: for thou wilt ſpit it out again, or reject it, and prefer an vther thing to it, that thou likes better. That meat quhilk thou likes not, enters neuer in thy ſtomach, and ſa it can neuer bee conuerted in thy nuriture: For it is onlie the ſecond apprehenſion of the meat, that is the cauſe of the nuriſhment of the body, to our corporall food: Swa

that, gif ȝee chewe not this meat, and lat it ouer; it feeds ȝou not. Then it is onely the ſecond apprehenſioun, that nuriſhes our bodie. It is euen ſiclike in thay ſpirituall things (ſa far as they may bee compared) in the foode of Chriſt Ieſus, quha is the life and nuriture of our ſaules and conſciences: there mann bee twa ſorts of apprehenſions of Chriſt Ieſus; The firſt apprehenſion, is be the eie of the minde, that is, be our knawledge and vnderſtanding▪ for as the eie of the bodie, diſcerns bee ane outwarde light; ſa the eie of thy mind, diſcerns be ane inward and renewed vnderſtanding, quhereby, wee gett the firſt apprehenſion of Chriſt. Now, gif this firſt apprehenſion of Chriſt, like vs weill, then the nixt followes: wee begin to caſt the affectioun of our hearts on him, wee haue good will of him: For all our affections proceeds fra our will, and our affection being renewed and made halie: we ſet it halely vpon Chriſt, we loue him; and gif wee loue him, wee take hald on him, we eat him, and digeſts him; that is, wee apply him to our ſauls: and ſa of this loue & liking of him, the ſecond apprehenſion dois folow. But gif ſa be, that we haue na

will of him, that we haue na loue nor lyking of him; quhat doe we I praye ȝou? Then we reject him, and prefers our awin idoll, and the ſeruice of our awin affecton to him; and ſwa, the ſecond apprehenſion follows not: We cannot digeſt him, and gif wee digeſt him not that ſpirituall life cannot grow in vs. For look in quhat place, the eie ſerues to thy bodie; in that ſame roume, ſerues knawledge and vnderſtaunding to thy ſaule: and looke in quhat place, thy hand and thy mouth, the taſt and the ſtomach, ſerues to thy body; in that ſame roume, ſerues the heart and affection to thy ſaull: ſa that, as our bodie cannot bee nuriſhed, except our hand take, and our mouth eat the meat, wherthrow the ſecond apprehenſion may follow. Likewiſe, our ſaules cannot feed on Chriſt, except we gripp him, and imbrace him hartelie be our wil and affection. For we come not to Chriſt, bee ony outward motion of our bodie, but be ane inward motioun and apprehenſion of the heart: for God, finding vs al in a reprobat ſenſe, hee brings vs to Chriſt, be reforming the affectioun of our ſaules, bee making vs to loue him. And therefore, the ſecond apprehenſion,

quhereby we digeſt our Sauiour, will neuer enter into our ſaules; except, as he pleaſes the eie, ſa hee pleaſe the will and the affection alſo. Nowe gif this come to paſſe, that our wil and affectioun is halelie bent vpon Chriſt; then na dout, we haue gotten this jewell of faith: haue ȝee ſic a liking in ȝour mind, and ſic a loue in ȝour heart of Chriſt, that ȝe will preferre him to all thinges in the warlde; Then na queſtioun, faith is begunne in ȝou.
               Now, fra time a thing be begun, there is farther required: for ſuppoſe this faithHow faith is nuriſhed & intertained in vs. be formed in ȝour mindes, in ȝour harts and ſaulles, ȝit that is not aneugh, but that quhilke is formed, man be nuriſhed, and hee quha is conceaued, mann bee intertained and brought vp; or els the loue that is begone in me bee the halie ſpirit, except be ordinare means, it be daily intertained and nuriſhed, it will decay: except the Lord continue the draught and working of his halie Spirit; it is not posſible that I can continue in the faith. And how mann we nuriſh and continue fayth in our ſaules? Twa maner of wayis: firſt, we nuriſh faith begun in our ſaul, be hearing

of the word: not of euerie word, but bee hearing of the worde of GOD preached: and not bee the hearing of euerie man; but be hearing the word preached be him that is ſent. For this is the ordinair meane, quherevnto the Lorde hes bound him: he will worke faith, be hearing of the word, and perceptioun of the Sacraments: and the mair thou heare the word, & the oftner thou receaue the Sacraments; the mair thy faith is nuriſhed. Nowe it is not onely, bee hearing of the word, and perception of the Sacraments, that we nuriſh faith. The word & the ſacraments, are not able of thame ſelfis, to nuriſh this faith in vs, except the working of the halie Spirite, bee conjoyned with their miniſterie: But the word and ſacraments, ar ſaid to nuriſh faith in our ſauls, becauſe they offer and exhibite Chriſt to vs, quha is the meat, the drinke, and life of our ſaules: and in reſpect, that in the word & Sacraments, we get Chriſt, quha is the foode of our ſaules; therefore the word and Sacraments, are ſayd to nuriſh our ſaules: as is ſet downe Acts 2. 42. The Diſciples of Chriſt, were earneſtlie occupied, and continued in the Apoſtles doctrine

and fellowſhippe, and breaking of bread, and praiers: bee thir meanes, intertening, augmenting, and nuriſhing the faith that was begun in thame. Then the halie Spirite begets this faith, works this faith, creats this faith, nuriſhes and intertaines this faith in our ſaules, be hearing of the preached word, and be participation of the ſacraments, quhilk are the ordinair meanes, quhereby, the Lord nuriſhes vs, and continews this ſpirituall food with vs: For looke be quhat meanes, the ſpirituall life is begunne, bee thay ſame means, it is nuriſhed and intertained. As this temporall life is intertained and nuriſhed bee thay ſame meanes, quhereby it is begun.
               Thē ſeing be thir means, the haly ſpiritConcluſion with an 
                        ••
                     
                     hortation. begets this work of faith in our ſauls: it is our dutie to craue, that he wil continue the wark, quhilk he hes begun: & for this cauſe, we ſuld reſort to the hearing of the word, quhen it is preached, and to the receauing of the ſacraments, quhen they ar miniſtred, that we may be fed in our ſauls to life euerlaſting. But alas, we are come to ſic a loath, diſdain, & offcaſting of this heauenlie foode in this Countrey: That

quhere men in the beginning, wald haue gane, ſome twentie miles, ſome fourtie miles, to the hearing of this word: they will ſcarcelie now come fra their houſe to the Kirk, and remaine ane hour to heare the word, but bides at hame. Weil I ſay, ouer great welth, gars wit wauer; and the aboundance of this word, ingenders ſik a lothſomnes, that it is a rare thing to find out onye, that hes that thirſt and deſire to heare the word, as they were wont to haue in the beginning: And as to our great men, they wil not heare it at all: for they cannot heare the thing that accuſes thame, and conuicts thame, but becauſe this word accuſes & conuicts thame, they run fra it. But they ſuld not do ſwa; they ſuld not run fra Chriſt, nor fra his worde that accuſes tham: but they ſuld hear the worde, and as the worde accuſes thame, they ſuld accuſe tham ſelfs alſo that therby, they may come to a confesſioun of their ſin, & obtaine mercie for the ſame. Sa, quhen Chriſt accuſes thee, thou ſuld not run fra him, but thou ſuld draw neer to him, thou ſuld threepe kindnes of him and make irruption, as it were, and forciblie enter in his kingdome. It is not the

way, quhen thy ſinne twitches thee, and quhē Chriſt accuſes thee, to run fra him: Na, thou ſuld then turn to him; thou ſuld confes thy ſin, cry Peccaui, & ſeek mercy: and efter that thou hes gottē mercy, this word ſal become als pleaſant to thee, and thou ſall take als great delite, to come to the hearing of it; as euer thou delited to fly fra it before. But alas, our lothſomnes and diſdaine, is grown to ſick ane height; that truly, I am moued to beleeue firmly, that the Lord hes concluded, that wee ſal not enter in his reſt; and that only, for the great contempt of his mercy and grace, quhilk is now ſa richly offered: For why? God cannot deal vtherwayis with vs, nor he dealt with our for fathers the Iſraelits, for the negligence of the euangel, quhilk was but then obſcurely preached: for thē, it was farre fra the incarnation of Chriſt; and the farther that it was fra his incarnation, the Euangell was ay the mair obſcurely preached, vnder darke types and ſhadows; Ȝit notwithſtāding, the fathers that hard that euangel preached, and beleeued it not; they periſhed all in the wildernes, except twa, as ȝe haue hard ſometime fra this place: And gif they, for the

contempt of ſa darke ane light periſhed: Meeklemair mann ȝe, that are their children periſh, for the contempt of the Son of righteouſnes, quha is riſen ſa plainlie, & ſhines ſa clearlie now, in the preaching of the goſpel: except the Lord in his mercy preuent ȝou, and except ȝee preuent his judgment be earneſt ſeeking, and except ȝe ſeeke a feeling, & ſeek inward ſenſes, that ȝe may ſee & feele the grace that is offered. Craue againe, that he wil ſanctifie ȝour hearts be repentance, that ȝee may repent ȝou of ȝour ſinnes, and take vp ane honeſt, and ane godly conuerſation in all time-comming; that baith body and ſaull may bee ſaued in the day of the Lord. The Lord worke this in ȝour ſauls, that ȝe may ſeeke mercie, & ſeeking mercie, ȝe may get mercy: and in mercie, ȝee may get a grip of Chriſt, and that for his righteous merites: To quhome with the Father and the halie Spirit, be all honor, praiſe and glorie, for now and euer.
               Amen.

                  INTO the Doctrine of our triall and due examination; the Apoſtle, as ȝee heard, (weilbeloued in Chriſt Ieſus) hee gaue vs a ſpeciall command, that euery ane of vs, ſuld trye and examine narrowlie our ſelfis; that is, that euery man ſuld condiſcend, and enter into his awn conſcience, try and examin the eſtait of his awin conſcience; in quhat eſtait hee findes it with

God, and in quhat eſtate he finds it with his neighbour: hee inioynes this tryal to our ſelfes, and commands that euery ane of vs, ſuld take paines vpon the true examination of our conſciences; hee injoyns this warke to vs, quhy? Be reaſon na man knawes ſa meekle of me as I do my ſelfe; be reſon, na man can be ſure of the eſtait of my conſcience, but I my ſelfe; be reaſon na man can ſa diligentlie, nor ſa profitably try my conſcience, as I my ſelfe: therfore chiefly it becomes every man, and woman, or ever they enter to the hearing of the worde, or giue eare to the worde, or their mouth to the Sacrament: It becomes thame to trye and examin their awin conſciences. Not that the Apoſtle walde ſeclude the tryal of vther men: for as it is leaſume to me to try my ſelfe, ſa na doubt it is leaſume to my Paſtour to try me: It is leaſume to vther men that hes a care ouer mee, to try and examine me: but na man can do this, ſa profitably to me, as I my ſelfe: and ſuppoſe we had neuer ſa mony examiners, and triers, all is loſt, gif we try not our ſelfs: Swa, quhither there be a ſecond or a third trier: let our ſelfe be the firſt, and let our ſelfe be

ane: And na dout the Apoſtles mind hes bene this to let vs ſee clearlie, that he or ſhe that comes to that table, and hes not that knawledge, nor is not of that ability to try thame ſelfes, are prophane commers, comes vncleanly as dogs, and therfore man come to their awn deſtruction. Let euery man therefore grow in knaweledge, growe in vnderſtanding, growe in the Spirite, that hee may bee the mair able to trie and examine his awin conſcience.
               To the end that ȝe might ga fordward, and proceede in the worke of this triall with the better ſpeede, and with the better fruits: Into this examination we laid downe this ordour. Firſt of all, wee lute ȝou ſee, quhat is that, quhilk wee call a conſcience, and quhat is meaned therby: Nixt, we lute ȝou ſee for quhat cauſes ȝe ſuld put ȝour conſciences to this trial and narrow examination: & thirdlie, ſa far as time ſuffered, we entered into the points, quhereinto euery ane of ȝou ſuld try and examine ȝour awin conſciences. As to conſcience, that ȝee may call that difinitioun to ȝour memorie; I will reſume it ſhortlie. Wee call a conſcience, a certaine

feeling in the heart, reſembling the righteous judgement of God, following vppon a deed done be vs, flowing of knawledge in the minde: A feeling accompanied with a motioun in the heart, a motioun, ather of feare or ioy, of trembling or rejoyſing. I leaue the opening vpp of thir pairts to ȝour memories; and I pray God, that they may be weill ſanctified. I come nixt to the cauſes, quherefore euerie ane of ȝou, ſuld bee carefull in trying and examining ȝour awin conſciences. The firſt cauſe is; becauſe the Lorde of heauen, hes his eie continuallie vpon the conſcience; the eie of God, comes neuer off the conſcience and heart of man; as I prooued to ȝou, be ſundrie places. Nixt, be reaſon this God hes choſen his ludgeing, and hes ſett downe his throne, to make his reſidence in the conſcience: Therefore, that hee may dwell in cleaneneſſe, ȝou aught to haue a regard to his dwelling place. Thirdlie, hee is the Lord: Ȝea, the onelie Lorde of thy conſcience, quha hes power onely to controle; quha onelie hes power to ſaue, or to tine: therfore, that it may doe good ſeruice to thy awn Lord, thou aught to take tent to thy

conſcience. And laſt of all, in reſpect, that the health of thy ſaull, ſtands in the eſtait of thy conſcience; and gif thy ſaull bee in good health, thy bodie cannot be euill: Therefore in reſpect, that ſaull and bodie, dependes vppon the eſtait of the conſcience; euerie ane of ȝou, ſuld carefullie looke to ȝour conſciences. I will not amplifie this, but remits the matter to ȝour memories: howe the health of the ſaull, and weilfair of the ſaull, ſuld be keeped.
               Nixt, I come in the thrid and laſt rowme, to the points, into the quhilk euerie ane of ȝou, ſuld try and examine ȝour conſciences: And as ȝe remember, I ſet down twa points, quhere into it behoues ȝou to put ȝour conſciences to triall. Firſt, to knaw quhether ȝour conſciences wes at peace with God, or not: ſecondlie, quhether ȝour conſciences wes in loue, in charitie, & in amitie with ȝour neighbour, or not: Into thir twa points chieflie, ȝee mann try and examine ȝour ſelfis. To ken quhether ȝee bee at peace with God or not, ȝe mann firſt try, quhether ȝe be in the faith, or not: (as the Apoſtle ſpeakes) quhether ȝee bee in the

faith of Chriſt or not: For, being in the faith, and juſtified thereby; of force ȝee mann haue peace with God, as the Apoſtle ſpeakes. Then the nixt cair mann be to try ȝour faith, and to ſee quhether ȝe haue faith, or not. Faith can na waies be tryed, but be the fruits: faith can not be judged on be mee, that lookes on it at the leaſt, but be the effects: Therefore to try quhether ȝee be in the faith, or not: take tent to the frutes: take tent to thy mouth, take tent to thy hand, take tent to thy wordes, and to thy deedes. For, except thou glorifie God in thy mouth, and confes to thy ſaluation: and except thou glorifie him alſo in thy deedes, and make thine haly life to teſtify of thy halyHow ane ſinceare faith is 
                        •••
                     w in faith, all is but vaine, all is but meer hypocriſie. Therefore to knaw the ſynceritie of thy faith, thou mann take tent, that there be ane harmony betwixt thy hand, thy mouth, and thy hart: that there bee a mutuall conſent, that thy doings prejudge not thy hart, that thy mouth prejudge not thy hart: but that mouth and hand, may teſtifie of the ſynceritie of the heart. Gif the heart, the hand, and the mouth, conſent and agree in ane harmonie

together: Na queſtion, that hart that breakes foorth in ſa good frutes, is coupled with God: there is na queſtion, the light of thy actions, the beames and ſhyning of thy life, ſall make the name of thy good God to bee glorified. Therefore the haill weight of our tryall ſtands chieflie vpon this point: to ſee quhether wee bee in the faith, or not: to examine quhether Chriſt dwels in vs bee faith, or not: For without faith, there can bee na coupling, nor conjoining betwixt vs and Chriſt: without faith our hart can not be ſanctified and clenged: and without faith we can not worke bee charitie: ſa all depends on this onlie. And therefore that ȝe might the better vnderſtād quhether ȝe haue faith or not: I gaid ſomequhat mair highly in this matter, and I begoud to lat ȝou ſee, how the haly Spirit creats faith, & workes faith in ȝour ſauls, harts, and mindes. I begouth to let ȝou ſee, quhat order the halye Spirite keeped, in forming and in creating this notable inſtrument in ȝour harts and mindes: Not only how he ingenders and begins faith, but alſwa how he interteinis it, how hee nouriſhes it: and we lute ȝou ſee, the externall

meanes and inſtrumentes quhilk he vſis to this effect. To beget faith in our ſauls, the halie Spirit vſes the hearing of the worde preached, bee him that is ſent; & the miniſterie of the Sacraments, as ordinarie meanes and inſtrumentes: quhilk ordinare meanes are onelie then effectual, quhē as the haly Spirit concurs inwardly in our hearts, with the worde ſtriking outwardlie in our eare: and with the Sacrament outwardlie receaued. And except the haly Spirit grant his concurrance to the word, and to the Sacrament; word and Sacrament wil not work faith. Swa, all depends vpon the working of this haly Spirit. The haill regeneration of mankinde, the renewing of the hart and of the conſcience, depends on the power of the haly Spirit: and ther fore it becoms vs cairfully, to imploy our trauails, in incalling for his haly Spirit. Be the ſame means and na vther, that the halie Spirite begets faith in vs; bee the ſame meanes he nouriſhis and augments that, quhilk he hes begotten. And therfore, as wee get faith bee hearing of the word; ſa be continuall and diligent hearing, we haue this faith augmented, and

nouriſhed in vs. And heir I drew out my exhortation, that gif ȝe wauld haue that ſpirituall life nouriſhed in ȝou, and gif ȝe wald haue a farder aſſurance of heauen: on force ȝe mann baith continuallie and diligentlie, heare the bleſſed worde of God.
               Now it reſts that euery ane of ȝou cairfullie applye this doctrine to ȝour awin ſaulls, and enter into the tryall of ȝour awin conſciences: to ſee, gif this faith, as I ſpake, bee begunne in ȝour hearts and minds, or not: How far, or how little the halie Spirit hes proceeded in that wark, try with mee, and I with ȝou. The firſt effect of the haly Spirite, quhereby ȝee may try ȝour minde, quhether it bee in the faith, or not; is this: Reuolue in ȝour memories, and remember, gif at ony time, it pleaſed the Lord in his mercie to turne the darcknes of ȝour minde vnto light, to make that darcknes quhilk wes within ȝou to depart. Be the quhilk darknes, nather had ȝee ane eie to ſee ȝour ſelfis, quhat ȝee war bee nature: nor ȝet had ȝee ane eie to ſee God in Chriſt, nor ony part of his mercie. Examine I ſaye, quhether gif this darcknes of the naturall

vnderſtanding, be turned into light, be the working of the Spirit, or not: Gif thou art become a childe of the light, a childe of the day: Gif thou art become as the Apoſtle ſpeakes, light in the Lord: Gif there be this alteration maid in thy minde, that quhere naturallye off before, it was cloſed vp in darcknes; quhere it was filled with vanities and errours; quhere it was cloſed vp in blindnes: gif the Lorde hes at onye time, enlightened the eie of thy minde, and maide thee to ſee thine awin miſerie, to ſee the vgglines of thin awin nature: to ſee they hainous ſinnes, in the quhilk be nature thou lyes: Gif he hes granted to thee, ane inſight of thy ſelf in ſome meaſure: and vpon the vther ſide, gif hee hes graunted thee ane out-gait: and hes giuen thee ane inſight of the mercie of God in Chriſt Ieſus: gif thou haue gotten ane inſight of the riches of his grace in Chriſt: Na doubt, the halie Spirit hes begun a good warke in thee: A wark, quhilk will bring foorth repentance, quhilk in his awin time hee will perfite. Sa this is the firſt cair that ȝe aught to haue, and the firſt point quherin ȝe aught to examine ȝour mindes: to

ſee gif there be any light in it, quhereby ȝe may knaw your miſery, and haue a inſight of the mercy of God in Chriſt. This being doone, that thou findes a ſight of thir twa in thy minde; fra thy minde, ga to the heart, and as thou hes tryed thy minde, ſa try thine hart. And firſt examine the hart, gif it bee altered or not: gif it be in ony ſort reformed or not, that the will of it bee framed and bowed to Gods obedience: that the affectioun bee turned in the luif of God, and bee powred out on him, as it wes powred out on vanities, on filthines, and on the warlde off before. Try quhither the ground of the hart, and the fountaine quherfra the motions and affections proceeds; be ſanctified, or not: For of ane haly fountaine, halie waters mann diſtill: of ane halye fountaine, halie motions, halie cogitations, and ſanctified conſiderations mann flow.
               Try then and examine ȝour heart, gif the ſpirit of God hes wrought ony ſik reformation (as I ſpake off) in the hart or not: And that thou may take vp the working of the halie Spirit, the better in thy hart and conſcience, quhilk makis chieflie

reſidence in the hart: I ſall lay before thee the firſt effect, that euer the halye Spirite brings foorth in thy hart: in framing it, in mollifying it, and in bowing it to the obedience of God. Thou ſall knaw the working of the haly Spirit, bee this effect: to wit, gif, as thy minde ſeeis, and behaldes quhat is ill, ſeeis and behaldes quhat is good, ſeeis and behaldes thine awin miſerie, and thy ſinnes that hes caſten thee in this miſerie: and ſeeis and behalds the riches of the mercie of God in Chriſt: Gif as thy mind ſeeis thir twa, thy hart be reformed and prepared, to loue the ſight of thame. As thou ſeeis in thy mind, the mercie of God, & that in Chriſt: gif thou hes ane hart to deſire mercie: gif thou hes ane thirſt and earneſt deſire, to bee pertaker of mercie: quhere this deſire and thirſt is, there the halie Spirit is, he hes, na doubt, opened the hart. Vpon the vther ſide, becaus, as thou ſeeis mercie, thou ſeeis thy miſerie: gif as thy minde ſeeis the miſerie, ſeeis the fountain quherefra thy miſery flows a to wit, fra thine awin ſins, gif then thyne heart alſo hates this; the halie Spirite is there. Gif as thou ſeeſt ſinne, quhilk is

the cauſe of thy miſerie, with the eye quhilk is giuen thee in thy minde; thou hateſt this ſinne with thy heart: na queſtion, the halie Spirite is there. And as thou hateſt it, gif alſo thou ſorrow for it, (for it is not aneugh to hate it, gif thou lament not the committing of it, & with a godlie ſorrowe deplore it:) the halie Spirite is there. And thirdlie, gif with thy lamenting, thou haue a care and a ſtudie to eſchew that ſinne; for quhat auailes it to lament; gif like a dogg, returning to his vomit▪ thou fall in that ſame golfe againe. Therefore, quhere there is ane hatrent of ſinne, a ſorrowe for ſinne, a care and a ſtudie to eſchewe ſinne: na queſtioun, the halie Spirite hes opened the heart, and is working out that precious inſtrument. Take vpp all this in a worde, take vp all the operation of the haly Spirite, and working in the heart in a word▪ and bee this examine thy heart. See and perceaue, gif the halie Spirite hes entred ſa farre with thee, to worke in that hard heart of thine, an erneſt, a diligent ſtudy, a carefull ſolicitude, continually to be reconciled with the gret god, quhom thou hes offended: Is there ſick a thing, as ane

thirſt and ane deſire to be at amitie with him, quhom thou hes offended, to be reconciled with the God of heauen, quhom thou hes offended be thy manifald tranſgresſions: quhere this care, and ſtudy of reconciliation is: Gif this care & ſtudy of reconciliation be in the heart; there is na dout, but the hart that thirſts for this reconciliation is hartelie content, not onlie to renounce ſin, to renounce al the impieties, that ſeucred thee fra God: but the hart that is indewed with this thirſt, will bee hartely content, to renounce it ſelfe, to caſt downe it ſelfe, for als ſtubborne as it wes off before, to caſte down the ſelf at the feete of the mightye GOD, and bee healilie content, in all times comming, to be ruled be his halie will: Not to followe the awin luſt, the awin will and appetite, as it did off before; but to reſigne the ſelf healilie in the handes of the mightie God, to bee ruled be his wil at his pleaſure, and to obey his appetite. And except ȝe find this diſpoſitioun in ȝour awin heart, to quite ȝour ſelfis, to renounce ȝour ſelfis; it is a vaine thing, to ȝou to ſpeake, that ȝee haue a thirſt to bee reconciled. Sa, the greater

thirſt of reconciliatiō that we haue. And the mair that this ſtudy grow is, the greater that the apprehenſion of my miſerie, of the deep gulfis & very hels (quherunto my ſaull is ſubiect) growes in my ſaull, the mair earneſt wald I be to be reconciled: & to be reconciled, I wald not ſtand, for the renuncing of the luſts of my hart; but I wald renoūce my hart, & the obedience of the wil & appetit of it▪ Quhy? becaus I ſee, I mann die for euer, except the Lorde reconcile him ſelf with mee. I ſee the huge deepes & oceans of all miſery, in the quhilk I ſal fal in the end, except in mercie, the Lord reconceile him ſelf with mee. To eſchew thir deepes and inconueniences, is there ony queſtion, but the hart that hath a ſenſe, and is touched with thame; wil maiſt willingly quite the ſelf. Againe, ſeing the Lorde hes tane paines to deliuer mee out of that deepe miſery, in the quhilk I drowned my ſelf, and hes purchaſed my redemption bee ſick a coaſtlie price: not with golde, nor with ſiluer, or ony draffe in the earth: but be ſick a wonderful way, be ſick a pretious price, and rich ranſome: Looking to the greatnes of our miſery, and to the

greatnes of the price, quhereby hee hes redeemed vs: quhat hart is it, but it willinglie walde renunce the ſelfe, to get a part of that redemption, and to be deliuered out of that hell, quherein wee are preſentlie, and quherein wee will be in a greater meaſure eſter this, except we be reconciled. Swa then, with this choſe, there is joined a diſpoſition in the heart, quherby the hart is willing in ſome meaſure, to renunce the ſelfe. This leſſon is oft tauld ouer to vs bee Chriſt, in his Euangell: We mann ather take vp a croſſe and renounce our ſelfis alſo, or wee cannot follow him. The mair that this thirſt growes in the heart, the mair this renouncing of our ſelfis growes: the mair that this thirſt decayes, and is diminiſhed in the heart, the mair cleaue wee to the warld, the mair cleaue we to the fleſh, and the mair are we ruled and guided be thame. Sa, ather mann wee nouriſhe a thirſt of righteouſnes, a hunger of life euerlaſting, a thirſt of mercie, a hunger of that juſtice that is in Chriſt; or it is not poſſible that in any meaſure, we can bee diſciples to him.
               Now I ga fordward: The heart that

efter this ſorte is prepared, that with a thirſt to be reconciled, is diſpoſed alſo to renounce the ſelf: this heart into the quhilk there lyes ſa earneſt a thirſt, is neuer fruſtrat of the expectation: that gree die heart is neuer diſapointed: but as the Lorde hes imprented in it, ane earneſt ſtudie to bee reconciled, and to get a grip of Chriſt: Sa in his mercy he grants vnto that hart the poſſeſſion of mercie, hee puts that heart in ſome meaſure, in poſſeſſioun of the mercye quhilke it ſeekes, in poſſeſſioun of Chriſt Ieſus him ſelf, quhom it ſeekes. The quhilk apprehenſioun of Chriſt, the heart ſenſiblye feels and gripes, in that peace, quhilk he giues to the conſcience: ſa that the conſcience quhilk wes terrified, exceedinglie gnawen, and diſtracted off before; be the incomming of this peace, and of Chriſt with his graces; incontinent it is quieted & pacified: there comes a calmnes and ſoundnes in the heart, and all troubles and ſtormis are remoued. With this peace is conjoined, ane taiſt of the powers of the warld to come. The heart gets a taiſt of the ſwetnes that is in chriſt of the joy, whilk is in the life euerlaſting,

quhilk taiſt is the only arlis-pēny, of that full and perfite joy, quhilk ſaull and bodie in that life ſhall enioy. And the arlispennie (as ȝee knaw) mann be a part of the ſowme, and of the nature of the reſt of the ſowme. And therefore, that arlispenie of joy aſſures vs, that quhen wee ſall get poſſeſſion of the haill ſowme, it ſall bee a ſtrange joy. And thir documents halds vp the heart, and makes it not to linger, nor wearie in the expectation of that life: but being refreſhed now and then therewith, be ſa mony arlis pē
                  nies: they aſſure vs of the full fruition of that joy, for the quhilk in patience wee will ſuſtein all troubles. Swa, as the halie Spirite workes a thirſt in vs, to be at Chriſt, a thirſt of mercy and reconciliation with him: the ſame halie Spirit diſapoints not that ſame expectatioun, nor thirſt; but puts the ſaull and hart in poſſeſſion of Chriſt: bee the quhilk the conſcience is pacified, the heart is rejoiced, and we get a taiſt of the ſweetnes, and of the powers of that life to come. The ſenſible feeling of the quhilk taiſt, that paſſes all natural vnderſtanding, quhat dois it in my hart and conſcience? It workes

a wonderfull aſſurance and perſwaſioun that God loues mee. The feeling of his mercie in the bowels of my heart, in the bottome of my conſcience, works a certain aſſurance and perſwaſion, that he is my God, that he will ſaue me for Chriſts cauſe; that the promiſe of mercy, quhilk I durſt not for my life applye to my conſcience off before; now bee the feeling of mercie, I dare baldly apply, and ſay: mercie apperteins to mee, life and ſaluation apperteins to mee.
               For the conſcience being exceedingly terrified, and ſeeing na thing in God but fire and wraith: it is not poſſible, but it mann flee fra him: it can not approch to ane conſuming fire: but fra time the conſcience get a taiſt of this peace, mercy, & ſweetnes; Looke how firſt it fled fra him off before: now efter this reconciliation it will runne als faſt to him, and wil poſſes him, mair and mair, fullie. Sa the aſſurance and perſwaſion of mercie, ryſes of the feeling of mercie in the heart and conſcience. And except the hart feele it, and taſte it in ſome meaſure: I dare not, nor na conſciēce dare for the life, apply God and his mercie to the ſelf. I may be

ſure in generall, that all my ſinnes are remiſsable, and that I may come be mercie, or I feele it: but to apply this mercie in particular to my ſelfe, quhill I feele a taiſt of it firſt, I dar not. Swa, this particular application, quhereby we claime God, and Chriſt as propertie to vs, as gif na man had title to him but wee, and to call him my God, my Chriſt, and to claime his promiſes, as na man had entres to them but wee: this comes of the ſenſe and feeling of mercie in the heart: And the mair that this feeling growes, & the farder experience, that wee haue in our awin hart of this peace and mercie, the greater growes our faith and aſſurance: Our perſwaſion becoms ſa ſtrong, that we dar at laſt come out with the Apoſtle and ſay: Quhat can twin mee fra the luif of God? Nather death, nather life, nather Angels, nor principalities nor powers, nor things preſent, nor things to come, is able to ſeperate mee fra the loue of God, quhilk is in Chriſt. This particular application, quhilk ryſes (na doubt) vpon the feeling and ſens of mercie, is the ſpecifik difference, the cheef mark and proper note, quhereby

our faith, quha ar juſtified in the blood of Chriſt, is diſcerned fra that generall faith of the Papiſtes. Our faith bee this particular application, is not onlye diſſcerned fra the generall faith of the Papiſtes, but it is diſcerned fra all the pretended faithes, of all the ſectes in the warld. For the Papiſt dare not applye the promis of mercy to his awin ſaul, he compts it preſumptiō to ſay, I am ane elect, I am ſaued and juſtified. And quherfra flowes this I pray ȝou? Only fra this, that in their conſcience, they haue neuer felt mercie, they haue neuer taſted of the luif, fauour, and ſweetnes of God: For, looke how faſt the conſcience fleeis fra God, before it get the taiſte of his ſweetnes: It runnes als diligentlie on him, & threapes luife on him, efter that it hes gotten that taiſt. Swa, they miſerable bodies contents thame with this generall faith, quhilk is na vther thing, bot ane hiſtoricall faith, that leanes only on the treuth of God, quherby I knaw that the promiſes of God are true: Bot the Papiſt dare not come, and ſay: they are true in mee; quhy? becaus hee hes not felt it, and the hart of him is not opned.

But our juſtifieng faith, as I tauld ȝou, conſecrates the haill ſaul, to the obedience of God in Chriſt. Sa that it reſts not only vpon the truth of God, nor it reſts not only vpon the power of God: ſuppoſe thir be twa chiefe pillars of our faith alſwa: but ſpeciallie and chieflie, it reſts vpon the mercie of God in Chriſt: it reſts alſo vpon the truth and power of God, but ſpeciallie vpon the promiſe of grace and mercie in Chriſt. The ſaull of the Papiſt, being deſtitute of the feeling and taiſt of mercie, dare not enter in this particular application, and ſwa hee can not be juſtified. Ȝea: na doubt, ſa mony of them as are juſtified, in the mercy of God gets a taiſt of his mercie, and kindnes, or thay die. This far concerning the effects.
               Then ȝe haue onely this to remember, the opening of the heart, the pacifiyng, & quieting of the conſcience; they worke ane aſſurance and a ſtrong perſwaſion of the mercie of God in Chriſt: The mair that the heart bee opened, the mair that the conſcience be pacified, the mair that the taiſt of that ſweetnes continue and remaine, the mair art thou aſſured of his

mercie. Swa then, wald thou knaw, quhither thy faith be ſtrong or not, quhither thy perſwaſion of Gods mercie, be ſtarke or not? Take tent to thy conſcience; gif thy conſcience bee hurt, aſſuredly thou will doubt; and gif thou doubt, thou can not haue ſicke a ſtrong perſwaſioun, as vtherwayis thou wald haue, gif thy doubting were away. Not that I wil haue faith to be ſa perfit in this life, that there be alwaies na doubting joined with it. I clame not to that perfection: but I ſay that ane hurt conſcience mann ever doubt, and the mair wee dout, the les is our perſwaſion: Swa the mair thou hurt thy conſcience, the leſſe faith thou hes. Then thou mann come to this point: Keepe mee a ſound conſcience; intertaine peace in thy conſcience, and thou ſall keepe faith, and ſal haue thy perſwaſion in that ſame meaſure, that thou hes of reſt and peace in thy conſcience: & the mair that thy conſcience bee at peace and reſt, the greater ſall thy faith and perſwaſioun be. Sa this ground halds faſt, ane doubting conſcience, makes a weake faith; and the mair the doubting in the conſcience bee, the weaker is the faith. Then the Apoſtle lies

not; quha ſays, that faith dwels in a good conſcience, that faith is locked and cloſed vpp in a good conſcience: Sa that gif ȝee keepe a good conſcience, ȝe ſal keepe a ſtrong faith; and gif ȝee hurt ȝour conſcience, ȝee ſall hurt ȝour faith. Nowe to make this mair ſenſible: How cann I bee perſwaded of his mercie, quhais anger I feel kendled againſt me, & againſt whom my conſcience ſhewes me to bee giltie of manie offences. Na queſtion, ſa lang as the ſenſe of his anger, and feeling of my offences bides; I cannot haue a ſtarke perſwaſion, that he will be mercifull to me: but quhen I gett acceſſe to his countenance, and ane ſight that hee hes forgiuen me; then I begin to be perſwaded. Sa keepe a good conſcience, and thou ſall keepe faith; and the better that thy conſcience be, the ſtarker mann thy faith be.
               Then the hail exhortation that we gather
                     
                        •
                     xhortation on this point, dependes vpon this: That euerie ane of ȝou, in quhat rancke ſa euer ȝee bee; take tent to ȝour conſcience: for looſing it, ȝe looſe faith; and loſing faith, ȝee looſe ſaluation. Bee ȝee in the ranke of great men, ȝee aught to tak tent to ȝour conſciences: Speciallie, in reſpect,

that the Lord hes placed ȝou in ane great calling: Ȝee haue mony thinges, quherein, ȝe aught to controle ȝour conſciences. Ȝee aught to craue the aduiſe of ȝour cōſcience, or euer ȝe put ȝour hand to onie warke: In reſpect ȝee are bound in manifauld duties to God, and to ȝour inferiours: And na doubt, gif ſome of our great men had aduiſed weill, theſe diſſolutions had not fallen out into their awn bodies. Thir oppresſions of the poore, thir deadlie feids, with their awin companions, walde not burſt out in ſick ane heigh meaſure, gif they had aduiſed weil with their conſciences. But the Lorde, ſeeing thame take ſa little tent to their conſciences, hee ſpoyles thame of fayth, and of the hope of mercie: and out of queſtion, ȝee fall ſee their end miſerable; Ȝee ſall ſee thame ſpectacles of the judgements of God: they that hes eies to behauld it, ſall ſee the God of heauen, make thir men, quha gais ſa diſſolutly to wark, ſpectacles of his judgemēts to the warld: For the Lord leaues not ſic men vnpuniſhed. Be theyr example, it were verie neceſſare, that men of inferiour rancks ſuld take tent to their conſciences: and therefore,

let euerie man, according to his calling, examine his calling, bee the rule of his conſcience. And ſpeciallie, this becoms ȝou that are judges; It becoms ȝou, before ȝe pronounce, and gif forth judgment, to aduiſe with ȝour conſcience and law thereof, and in judgement, not to folow ȝour affection, but to follow the rule of ȝour conſcience. Likewayis, ȝee that are of inferiour ranks to Iudges, and ȝee that are aduocats, controlle ȝour doings be ȝour conſcience, and giue not the leages nor ſubjects of this Countrey, juſt cauſe to complaine on ȝou: terrifie tham not, fra the pleading of juſtice be exorbitant prices, and extraordinair kind of doing: but moderate al ȝour actions ſa, that they agree with the rule of ȝour conſciences; that ſa farre as in ȝou lies, juſtice ceaſe not. This that I ſpeake to thame, I ſpeake to ȝou of the Merchand eſtait alſo: See that ȝee looke not ſa meekle, to this or that, as to the conſcience that is in ȝou; quhat in conſcience ȝee may doe, according to the meaſure of knawledge, that God hes placed in ȝou: and quhatever ȝee doe; beware, ȝee doe not againſt ȝour knawledge. I graunt ȝour knaweledge

will not bee ſa learned, as it ſuld be and this makes mony deformed actions; Ȝit lat not a man doe againſt his knaweledge: but let euerie man doe according to the meaſure of knawledge, quherwith God hes indued him: And ſuppoſe it be not weil reformed, ȝit or thou do be ges, be aduiſed with thy conſcience, and followe thy knawledge: For that quhilk is done doubtinglie, is ſinne. Swa, quhateuer thou doe; let not thy eie, thy hand, nor ony member of thy bodie, do againſt thy knawledge: For this is a ſtep to that heigh ſinne againſt the halie Spirit. This is the readie way, to put all knawledge out of ȝour mind. For gif mē do againſt knawledge, & continue in doing againſt knawledge: at laſt, they will become a maſſe of darkneſſe, the Lorde will ſcrape all knawledge out of their minde, and all feeling of mercie out of their heart, giff they feele it not better: Therefore, euery ane of ȝou, follow ȝour knawledge, and according to the meaſure of ȝour knawledge, let ȝour actions proceed.
               It hes pleaſed the Lorde, to poure thisFaith is the free gift of God. liquour, this precious ointment in vs; ſuppoſe we be earthly and lame veſſels, miſerable

creatures; ȝit it hes pleaſed our gratious God, to poure ſic a precious liquor in our hearts and minds, and to concredite ſick ane jewell in our hands and keeping, that bee the vertue of this liquour, we may tak hauld on Chriſt, quha is our juſtice, our wiſedoome, ſanctificatioun, and redemption. Suppoſe we be miſerable creatures, ȝit the Lord of his mercie, hes a reſpect to vs in Chriſt, in giuing vs this precious liquour, quherby our ſauls may bee ſeaſoned to life euerlaſting. In this, that he powres it in our hearts, we ſee clearelie, that it growes not in our hearts, nor breeds not in our nature. Na, this gift of faith, is not at mans cōmand, nor vnder his arbitrament: as gif it lay in his hand to beleeue, or not to beleeue, as he pleaſes. It is the gift of GOD, poured downe freelie of his vndeſerued grace, in the riches of his mercie in Chriſt. That it is a gift, ȝee ſee clearelie, 1. COR. 12. 1. quhere the Apoſtle ſayis; and to an vther is giuen faith bee the ſame ſpirit: as alſo, PHIL. 1. 21. quhere hee ſayis: For vnto ȝou it is giuen for Chriſts cauſe, that not onelie ȝee ſuld beleeue in him, but alſo ſuffer for his ſake. Sa faith is the gift of

the halie Spirit: and this gift is not giuen to all men and women, as the Apoſtle plainelie declares: All hes not faith. This gift, ſuppoſe it be giuen, it is not giuen to all, but is onely giuen to the elect, that is, to ſa mony as the Lord hes appointed to life euerlaſting. This gift, quhere euer it is, and in quhat heart ſoeuer it bee, it is neuer idle, but perpetuallie working, and working weil by loue and charitie, as the Apoſtle ſayth. GAL. 5. 6. This gift, quher euer it bee, is not dead, but quicke and liuelie, as the Apoſtle IAMES ſaith, in his ſecond Chapter. And to let ȝou knawe, quhither it be liuely and working or not, there is not a waye, but to looke to the fruits and effects that flowes fra it: And therefore that ȝee, be ȝour awin effectes, may be the mair aſſured of the goodnes of ȝour faith: I will giue ȝou three ſpeciallCertaine effects quhere by ane may knaw, gif we haue faith. effects to looke on, be the quhilk ȝe may judge vppon the goodneſſe of ȝour faith. Firſt of all, looke to thy heart, and caſt thine eie on it: Gif thou hes a deſire to pray, a deſire to craue mercy for thy ſinnes, to incall vpon Gods halie name for mercie and grace: gif there be ſick a thing in thy heart, as ane deſire to praie,

gif there be ony peece of thine heart inclined, and hes a thirſt to ſeek efter mercie and grace: ſuppoſe the greateſt part of thy heart repine, and wald draw thee fra prayer: ȝit aſſuredlie that deſire that thou hes in ony meaſure to prayer, is the true effect of the right faith. Gif thou haue a hart to pray to God, ſuppoſe this deſire be but ſclender, aſſure thy ſelf thy ſaull hes life: for prayer is the life of the ſaull, and maks the faith liuelie; for why? Praier is Gods awin gift; it is not our gift, for gif it were ours, it wald be euill. But it is the beſt gift that ever God gaue man, and ſa it mann be the gift of his awin haly Spirit; and being his awin gift, it mann make our faith liuelie. Beſide this, thou art not able, nor thou dare not call vpon him, in quhom thou beleeues not, as the Apoſtle ſaith. ROM. 10. 14. For gif I intreat him be praier, I mann truſt in him. Then praier is a certaine argument of iuſtifying faith and beleife in GOD: For I cannot ſpeake to him; let bee to pray to him, in quhome I truſt not: And ſuppoſe the heart be not fullie reſolued, and weill diſpoſed; ȝit gif there be ony part of the heart that inclines to praier, ſticke bee it;

it is a ſure gadge, that that part beleues. The ſecond effect, wherby thou ſal knaw, quhither faith bee in thee or not, is this; looke and aduiſe with thy ſelfe, gif thy heart cann bee content, to renounce thy rankour, to forgiue thy grudges, and that freelie for Gods cauſe: may this be done be thee? and will thou forgiue thy neighbour, as freely as God hes forgiuen thee? aſſuredlie, that is the effect of the right Spirit; for nature could neuer giue that. There is nathing, quherevnto nature bends the ſelfe mair, nor to rankour and enuie; and there is nathing, quherein nature places her honor mair guckedly, nor in priuie reuengement. Now gif thy hart bee ſa tamed and brought downe, that it wil willinglie forgiue the injurie for gods cauſe; that is the effect of the right Spirite: This is not my ſaying; it is Chriſts ſaying, MAT. 6. 14. quhere hee ſaith: gif ȝee do forgiue men their treſpaſſes, ȝour heauenlie father wil alſo forgiue ȝou; and 15. verſe: but gif ȝee do not forgiue men their treſpaſſes, na mair wil ȝour heauenlie Father forgiue ȝou ȝour treſpaſſes. Sa wald Chriſt ſay; he that forgiues wrangs, ſall get wrangs forgiuen him; but he that

wil reuenge his wrangs, wrang ſal be reuenged vppon him. Therefore, as thou wald bee ſpared in thy wrangs, doone to the mightie God; ſpare thou thy neighbour. I will not inſiſt; examine quhither ȝe haue faith or not; examine it be prayer, examine it bee the diſcharge of ȝour awin priuie grudges; for gif ȝee want thir effects: Ane heart full of rankour, an hart voyd of praier, is ane heart faithleſſe, and meet for hell. The third effect of faith is compasſion; thou mann bowe thy heart, and extend thy pitie, vpon the pure members of Chriſts bodie, and ſuffer thame not to lacke gif thou haue: for except ȝee haue this compasſioun, ȝee haue na faith. Examine ȝour ſelfs bee thir three effects, and gif ȝee finde thir in onie meaſure; how beeit, it were neuer ſa ſmall▪ ȝou haue the right faith in ȝour hart, the faith that ȝou haue, is true and liuelie, and aſſuredly God will be mercifull to ȝou.
               This faith of ours, ſuppoſe it be liuely, ȝit it is not perfect in this warld, but euerieOur faith man be continually nuriſhed, becauſe it is ioyned with douting. day, and euery houre, it craues a continuall augmentatioun, it craues euer to be nuriſhed: for the quhilk increaſe, the Apoſtles thame ſelfis, LVK. 17. 5. incalled

and ſaid: Lorde increaſe our faith. And our maiſter commaunds vs to pray, and ſay, Lorde increaſe our faith, I beleeue, Lorde helpe my vnbeliefe. Then Chriſts commaund lats vs ſee clearely, that this faith, miſters continually to bee nuriſhed and helped, and it cannot be helped, but be praier: ſa we ſuld alwayis continue in praier. That this faith ſuld be helped, and that wee ſuld bee perpetuallie vppon our garde, in feare and trembling to gett it augmented: the terrible doubtings, the wonderful pits of deſparatioun, into the quhilk, the deareſt ſeruaunts of God are caſten, dois clearelie teach: For the beſt ſeruants of God, are exerciſed with terrible doubtings in their ſaules, with wonderfull ſtammerings, and they will bee brought at ſomtimes, as appears in their awin judgement, to the verie brinke of deſperatioun. Thir doubtings and ſtammerings lets vs ſee, that this faith of ours wald bee perpetuallie nuriſhed, and that wee haue neede, continuallie to pray for the increaſe of it. It pleaſes the Lorde, at ſomtimes, to let his ſeruants haue a ſight of thame ſelfes, to caſt thame downe, and to let thame ſee, how ouglie ſinne is: It

pleaſes him, to let thame fall in the bitterneſſe of ſinne, and to quhat end? Not that he wil deuour thame, or ſuffer tham to be ſwallowed vp be deſperation. Suppoſe EZEKIAH cries out, that like an hungrie lyon, the Lord is like to deuour him, & bruiſe him in peces: ȝit the Lord ſuffers him not to diſpair. And ſuppoſe DAVID cry, I cannot away with his conſuming fire, I may not bide the fire of the Lordes ielouſie; ȝit he diſpairs not: But the Lord caſts his ſeruants very low; to quhat end? To the end, that they may feele in their hearts and conſciences, quhat Chriſt ſuffered for thame in the ȝarde, and on the croſſe, in ſaull and bodie: Ȝea, wee wald thinke, that there had bene plaine colluſion betwixt the Father and the Son, and that his ſuffering had bene na ſuffering: except we felt in our ſauls in ſom meſure, the hell quhilk hee ſuſteined in full meaſure. Swa to the effect, that wee might clearelie vnderſtand the bitternes of ſin, that we might knaw, how far wee are addetted to Chriſt, quha ſuffered ſicke torments for our ſinne, and that we may be the mair able to thank him, and to praiſe his halie name: hee ſuffers his awin ſeruants

to dout, but not to diſpair: he forgiues thir doutings, he forgiues thir ſtam rings, and in his awn time, hee ſupports tham, and brings vs to the waters of life.
               Thir doubtings, as I haue oft ſpoken, may ludge in ane ſaul with faith; for douting & faith, are not extreamly opponed; Onelie faith and diſpair, are extreamelieDoubting and fayth may ludge in ane ſaule. opponed: and therfore, faith and diſpair, can not baith ludge in ane ſaule; for diſpair cuts the pillers of hope, and quher there is na hope, there cann bee na faith. But as to doubting, it mann ludge, it will ludge, and hes ludged in the ſaules of the beſt ſeruants that euer God had. Looke to the Apoſtle, we are alwayis in doubt, ſaith he, but we diſpair not. Sa, douting and faith may ludge in an ſaul: & quherfra flowes this doubting? We knaw, that in the regenerat man, there is a remnant corruptioun: For wee gett not our heauen in this earth: ſuppoſe we beginn our heauen heere, wee get it not fullie heere: And gif all corruption were away, quhat ſuld there reſt, but a full heauen heere? Sa it is onelie begun in this life, and not perfited; therefore there remains in the ſaul, a great corruptioun, quhilk is neuer idle,

but continuallie occupied. This corruption is euer bringing foorth the birth of ſinn, part leſſe, part mair; euerie ſin hurts the conſcience; ane hurt conſcience, impairs the perſwaſion, and ſa comes in the doubting. For there is not a ſinne that we commit, but it banniſhes light, & caſts a ſlough ouer the eie of our faith, quherby, wee doubt and ſtammer in our ſight. And were not the Lord of his mercy taks vs vp, giues vs the gift of repentance, and maks vs euery day, als oft as we ſin, to cry als oft for mercy, & ſa to repair the loſſe that wee haue of faith, to repair the loſſe quhilk we haue of the feeling of mercie, we wald gang on, and halely put out that ſame light. But it pleaſes the Lorde; ſuppoſe we be euerie day ſinning, to giue vs the gift of repentance; & be repentance, to repaire our faith, to repaire the ſenſe and feeling of mercie in vs, and to put vs in that ſame eſtait of perſwaſion, quherein we were off before. Therefore, gif God beginn not, continue not, and ende not with mercie: in that ſame moment, that he abſtracts his mercie fra vs, we will decaye. Swa, ȝee mann bee diligent incallers for mercie: ȝe mann be inſtant continuallie,

in ſeeking to haue a feeling of mercie. This far for the doubting.
               Now, howſoeuer it be ſure and certain that the faith of the beſt children of GodA doubting and a weak faith, is faith and ſall neuer heali

This comfort and conſolation, the Spirite of God hes ſet downe in his word, to hald vp the troubled hart: that howſoeuer faith bee weake, ȝit a weake faith, is faith: and quhere that faith is, there mann euer bee mercie. Ȝee haue in ROM. 11. 29. that the giftes and calling of God, are without repentaunce. But amang all his giftes that are of this ſort, faith is ane of the cheefeſt, therfore it can not be reuoked againe. Ȝee haue in IVDE 3. that faith is ains giuen to the ſaints: ains giuen: that is, conſtantly giuen, neuer to bee changed, nor vtterlye tane fra thame. The Lorde will not repent him of this gift, but the ſaul quhilk he hes luifit ains, he will luif perpetually▪ It is true and certaine, that the ſpoonks of faith quhilk are kindled in the hart be

the Spirite of God; certaine it is, they may be ſmored for a lang time: they may bee couered with the aſſes of our awin corruption, and with our awin ill deeds and wickednes, in the quhilk we fall: it is true, that the effects of a liuelie faith wil be interrupted, and that thy luſts and affections will preuaile for a lang time: Sa that quhen thou lookes on thy ſelf, vpon the judgements of GOD that hangs on ſaull and bodie, and quhen thou lookes vpon thy diſſolute life, and on the anger of God agains this diſſolute life: In the minde, in the hart and conſcience of him that hes ſa ſmored and oppreſſed his faith, it will oft times come to pas in his awin judgement, hauing his eies fixt on him ſelf onlie: that he will thinke him to be a reprobate, to be ane affcaſt, and neuer able to recouer mercie. Quhere this corruption burſtis furth in gros maner, efter that the Lord hes called thee: Look howe ſone the Lorde beginns to walken thee again: incontinent, thou fixes thine eies vpon thine awin life, and enters in a deepe conſideration, als weill of the grauity of thy ſinne; as of the weight of the wrath of God, quhilk thou ſeeis following

thereon; and is ſalaith to remit thy cogitation, to pans vpon the deepnes of the mercie of God; ſtanding fixt in this cōſideration, it can not bot come to pas in thy awin judgement, bot thou art ane aff-caſt: And ȝit God forbid it wer ſa, for ſuppoſe they ſponks of the ſpirit be couered, be the corruption that is within thy ſaul, ȝit they ſponks ar not halily put out

As for the confirmation of my argument, that howſoeuer our bodies bee lowſed to all diſſolutioun, efter our effectuall calling within vs in our ſauls, and that ȝit the ſpoonks are not idle, ȝee ſee, that ſuppoſe the fire bee couered with the aſſes; ȝit it is a fire: there is na man will ſay, that the fire is put out ſuppoſe it bee couered: Na mair is faith put out of the ſaull, ſuppoſe it be ſa couered, that it nather ſhawe hewe nor light outwardlie. Example of this wee haue clearlie in DAVID: Efter his lamentatioun

in that pſalme of repentance. PSAL. 51. 11. he prayes to God in thir terms: Caſt mee not away from thy preſence: And quhat ſubjoines hee? And tak not thine halie ſpirit from mee. Had he not loſt the Spirit, be his adultery and murther? Na: for hee walde not haue ſaide then, take it not from mee, but reſtore it to mee. It is true, he vſis ſick faſhion of language, as PSAL. 51. 12. he ſayes: Reſtore to mee the joy of thy ſaluation: not that he lacked the Spirit healilie; but that the Spirit lacked force in him, and miſtered ſtrengthening and fortification: It wald bee ſteered vp, that the flame of it might appeare. Therefore I ſaye, in reſpect DAVID ſayes ſa clearlie, efter his adulterie and murther; take not that Spirite from mee: it is a certaine argument, that the faithfull hes neuer the Spirite of GOD alwayes tane fra thame, in thair greateſt diſſolutions. The ſecond point is this; How proue I that thir ſpoonks are not idle, ſuppoſe the outward effects bee interrupted. As DAVID felt this in his conſcience, ſa euery ane of ȝou may feele it in ȝour awin conſciences. The Spirit of God in mans heart can not bee idle, but

thir ſpoonkes, in the mean time that the bodie is caſtin lowſe to all diſſolutions, thir ſpoonkes are accuſing thy diſſolution, are finding fault with thy manners: thir ſpoonkes ſuffers thee not to take the pleaſure of thy body, without great bitterneſſe, and continuall remorſe. And thir ſpoonkes quhere they are, they will make the ſaull quherein they dwel, to vtter thir voces, at ane time or vther; ains in the twentie fowre howres: Allas, I am dooing the ill quhilk I wald not doe, gif I hadd power or ſtrength to reſiſt my affectioun, and gif I might be maiſter of my affection, I wald not for all the warld do the ill quhilk I do. Againe, gif I had power to do the good quhilk I wald doe, I walde not leaue it vndoone for all the warld. Swa thir ſpoonkes, ſuppoſe they haue not ſick force and ſtrength preſentlie, as to reſiſt the affection, and to halde the ill turnes vndone; ȝit perpetuallie in the heart, they are finding fault with thy corruption: and ſuffers thee not to take thy pleaſure without paine: but laſt of all makes thee to vtter thir voces: Gif I had ſtrength to reſiſt, I walde not doe the ill quhilk I do. Quhere thir voces are, na

queſtioun, they are the voces of a ſaull, quhilk the Lorde hes begun to ſanctifie: and being ains ſanctified, in deſpite of the Diuell, and of the corruption that is in vs, this faith ſhall neuer periſh: But gif the haill ſaull without contradictioun, with a greedie appetite and pleaſure bee caried to ill, and hes na ſorrow for it: that ſaull is in ane ill eſtait: I can look for nathing to ſick a ſaull but death; except that the Lord preuent tham. But quhere this remorſe and ſorrowe, and ſick voces are in the ſaull; that ſaul in the time that God hes appointed, ſall recouer ſtrēgth: The Lord ſall neuer ſuffer they ſpoonkes to be halilie tane awaye, but in his awin time he ſall fortifie tham, & make thame to breake out before the warlde in good warks. The Lord in his awin time, he wil ſanctifie tham: he wil ſcatter the aſſes of corruption, ſteir vp the ſponkes, & make tham to breake out in a better life, nor euer they did before: as ȝe may clearly ſee that DAVIDS repentance hes done mair good to the Kirk of God, nor gif he had neuer fallē. Thus far cōcerning the effects
               Suppoſe the effects of repentance bee interrupted, ȝit they ſpoonks are not extinguiſhed.

For, there is na man will thinke, that the fire quhilk is coueredSimilitudes ſhewing that the ſpoonks of faith, ſupoſe they be couered are not extinguiſhed. with aſſes, is extinguiſhed; but being ſtirred vp in the morning, it will burne als clearlie, as it did in the night before. There is na man will compt the treeis, that nowe in the time of winter, wants leaues, fruit, and externall beautie to be dead: there is na man wil coūt the Sun to be out of the lift; ſuppoſe it be ouercled with a clud of darknes & miſt: There is a great differēce, betwixt a ſleepry diſeaſe, and death; for men ar not dead, ſuppoſe they be ſleepand; and ȝit there is nathing lyker to death nor ſleepe. As there is great ods, betwixt a drunken man and a dead man: ſa there is great odds betwixt the faith that lurks for a quhil, and vtters not the ſelfe, and the light that is vtterlie put out. Quhen wee burſt not foorth in outward deeds; GOD forbid that we ſuld thinke, that thir ſponkes are halelie extinguiſhed: Indeed the ſaul that is viſited efter foule defectiouns fra his calling, & againſt his knawledge; or this ſaul recouer the former beauty; it is in a ſtraunge daunger. For gif the Lord ſuffer thy corruption to get looſe, in ſik ſort,

that it carie thee as it will, and bee all meanes posſible, make thee to labour, to put out the ſpoonke of regeneration. Quhen the Lord beginnes to challenge thee, or to gar thee rander a compt of thy bygane life: the ſaull of that man, quhen it is challenged, is in great daunger. Sa that, na queſtioun, quhen the Lord begins to lay to ȝour charge, ȝour diſſolute life, the contempt and abuſe of ȝour calling: Aſſuredlie ȝour ſauls are ſa neere to the brinke of deſperation, that there can bee nathing nearer. For, will thou look to God, thou will ſee nathing bot his anger kendled, as ane fire againſt thee: Will thou looke to thy ſelfe, thou will ſee nathing, bot ſinne prouoking his anger: thou will ſee the contempt and abuſe of thy calling, multiplying his anger: thou will ſee nathing, bot matter of diſpaire.

Ga back ouer againe, to thy bygane experience, caſt ouer thy memorie, and remember, gif God at ony time, in onye ſort hes loued thee: gif euer thou hes felt the loue and fauour of God in thy heart and conſcience: Remember gif euer the Lorde hes ſwa diſpoſed thy heart, that as hee loued thee, thou loued him: and had a deſire to get him. Remember on this, and repoſe thine aſſurance on this: that as he loued thee ains, hee will loue thee ay, and will aſſuredlie reſtore thee to that loue, or thou die. The heart that felt ains this loue of God, ſall feele it againe: And look quhat gift, or grace, or quhat taiſt of the power of the warlde to com, that euer the Lord gaue to his creatures in this life: to that ſame degree of mercie, hee ſall reſtore his creature or euer it depart this life. Sa the ſaull that is toſſed with high aſſaultes, and great dangers: quhere preſent things will not helpe, it is neceſſare, that it haue recourſe to bigane things, and keepe in memorie,

the bigane experience of mercie, quhilk the Lorde hes freely ſhawen toward that ſaul. This ſame memory ſalbe ſa pleaſant to the ſaull, that it ſal ſtay it preſently fra deſperation, & vphauld it vnto the time, the Lord pacifie that hart, and giue comfort to that ſaul: quhilk being done, that ſaull ſall ſee, that howſaever hee was angry, he was angry onely for a quhile.

IOH. 4. 8. God is loue; Sa, ſeeing God is loue it ſelfe, quhaſaeuer will reſemble him, mann be indued with the oile of loue.

To ſpend lang time in the praiſe of loue, it ſal be na wayes neceſſare, ſeing the haly ſcripture reſoūds, in blaſing the commendation of it: bot that we ſpeake not of a thing ambiguous, we ſall lat ȝou ſee, how this word is conſidered and tane inHow the word loue is tane in the Scriptures. the ſcriptures. Loue is conſidered, ather as a ſpring and fontain, quherfra the reſt proceeds: that is, for the loue, quhereby we loue God. And as loue coms firſt fra God, & is powred be his halie Spirit in our harts: ſa, it firſt redounds vpward, & ſtrikes back vpon him ſelfe: for the loue of God mann euer ga before the loue of the creature. Nixt, we take this word for that loue, quhereby we loue Gods creatures, our neighbours, & ſpecially them that are of the family of faith. And thridly it is tane, for the deedes of the ſecond table, quhilk flowes fra this loue. Nowe, quhen I ſpeake of loue, I ſpeak of it as in the ſecond ſignificatioun: to wit, as it is tane for the loue of our neighbour: And taking it ſwa, I call loue the gifte ofThe defini

                      towards God. coms fra God, it returnes to God: as it coms down fra him, ſa it ſtrikes vpwarde to him againe: & is it not good reaſon? for quhy? Let thy heart fixe thy loue als lang as thou will vpon the creaturs, thou ſall neuer be ſatiat, nor thy affection ſall neuer be content, except thou get a grip of God. But gif ains thou loue God in thy hart, & caſt thy affections vpon him, and get ains a grip of him: the langer thou loue him, the greater ſatiety & con tentment ſall thou haue: thou ſall not thirſt for ane vther. For, as to the creatures, there is neuer a creature that God created, but it is ſtamped with his awin ſtamp, and euery creature beares his Image: and looking to the image of God in the creature, ſuld it not draw thee to him, that thou fixe not thy hart vpon the creature: for his awin image in his creature, ſulde lead thee to him ſelfe. And therefore the mair that thou knawes the creatures; the greater varietie of knawledge that thou hes of the creatures, the

mair ſuld euery particular knawledge of thame drawe thee to God, and the mair ſuld thou wonder of thy God, and knaw thy duety towards him. And ſeeing that delite flowes of knawledge, and that euery knawledge, hes the awin delite with it: as the varietie of knawledge that riſes vpon the creatures, ſuld make the minde to mount vp to the knawledge of God: ſa the varietie of delites, that riſes vpon the diuerſitie of this knawledge, ſulde moue the heart vpwarde, to the loue of God: and the hart getting a grip of God and being ſeaſed with the loue of God: and the minde being occupied with the true knawledge of God; ſa ſone as heart and mind is full of God, the hart is quiet and the minde is ſatisfied. Sa that the mair this knawledge grows in thy mind, the greater contentment hes thou, & the mair the loue of him growes in thy hart, the greater joy and rejoiſing hes thou in thy ſaull. For quhy? In God ȝe haue not only all the creatures: but ȝee haue himſelf, beſide the creatures: And therfore in God, ȝe haue al the knawledge & delite that can riſe of the creatures: and beſide the creatures, ȝe haue God himſelfe

quha is the Creator. And ſwa I ſay, the mind of man, can neuer quiet the ſelfe in the knawledge, nor the heart cann neuer ſettle the ſelfe in the loue of naked creaturs, in reſpect they ar flowing & vanitie, as SALOMON cals thame: but in the infinite God, rightlie knawin, and earneſtlie loued; the mind ſall ſee a full reſt, and the heart ſall haue a perfite ioy. For our affection is ſa inſatiable, that na finit thing will ſatisfie it, nor there can bee na ſolide ſetling vpon the thing that is tranſitorious. Sa the loue aught to ſtrike vpward, and redound firſt to God, in quhais face, the heart ſall find full and perfite ioy.
               The ſecond argument that I vſe, is this:Of loue towards our neighbour. ſeeing there is only an precept left be our maſter in recōmēdatiō to be obſerued be vs, to wit; that euery ane of vs ſuld loue anvther: Therfore our wiſe maſter, vnderſtanding well, that quhere loue was, there miſterd na ma laws: that the life of man, be loue only behoued to be maiſt happy, left only the ſame in chief recommendation, and taks vp the hail law & euangell in a word, Loue. And gif the hart of man were indued with loue, his life might bee maiſt happy and bleſſed: For there is nathing

maks this life happy, but the reſemblance & likelyhood that wee haue with God. The nerer we draw to God, the mair bleſſed is our life; for there cannot be ſik a happy life, as the life of God. Now ſayis IOH. in his 1. epiſt. 4. 8. God is loue; therfore, the mair we draw neere to loue, the mair neer ar we to that happy life: for we are in God, & partaker of the life of God. Quhen I ſpeak this, ȝe mann not thinke, that loue in God, & loue in vs, is an thing; for loue is but a quality in vs, & it is not a quality in God; there is nathing in God but that quhilk is God; ſa loue in God, is his awin eſſence: Therefore, the mair ȝee grow in loue, the neerer ȝe draw to God, and to that happye and bleſſed life. For there is nathing mair profitable, mair agreeable and conuenient to nature, nor to loue; and aboue al things to loue God: And therefore it is, that God and his Angels are maiſt happy & bliſt, becauſe they loue all thinges, and deſires ever to doe good. On the vther ſide, there is nathing mair vnhappy, nathing mair noyſum, mair hurtfull, and that eats vpp nature mair, nor to burn with envie and hatred, And heirfore it is, that the deuils ar maiſt

miſerable, quha torments thame ſelues with continual mallice and hatred, burning with ane vehement appetite, to bee noyſum to all creatures. Sa as the life of the Deuill is maiſt vnhappy, becauſe hee is full of envie and malice: Siclike our life mann be maiſt happy, gif wee be full of loue. To ſpeake of loue I will na farder: Onelie gif ȝe haue loue, marke the effects of it, ſet downe 1. COR. 13. 4. 5. 6. 7. verſ. quhilk effectes, gif ȝee haue not in ſome meaſure, ȝee haue not true loue.
               I end heere, ȝee ſee in quhat points, euery ane of ȝou aught to be prepared; ȝeConcluſion with an exhortation mann bee indued with this loue, and ȝee mann bee indued with faith: and gif ȝee haue thir in onie ſmal meſure; gang baldly to the hearing of the word, and to the receauing of the Sacrament. This is the preparation that we allow of: I grant, the Papiſtes hes a preparatioun, but nathing like to this, and therefore they cann haue na warrand of the word of God. Laſt of all, ſeeing wee are commanded to try our ſelfs: he that lacks knawledge, cannot try himſelfe: A furious man cannot try himſelfe: A childe cannot try himſelf: therefore they aught not to com to the Table.

All thir things being weill conſidered; he that hes faith & loue in ony kind of meaſure, let him come to the Table. And all thir things ſeruis, als weil for the hearing of the word fruitfully, as for the receuing of the Sacrament. Therefore, the Lord of his mercie illuminate ȝour mindes, and worke ſome meaſure of faith and loue in ȝour hearts: that ȝee may be partakers of that heauenly life, offered in the worde and Sacraments: that ȝe may begin ȝour heauen heere, and get the full fruition of the life to come, and that in the righteous merits of Chriſt Ieſus: To quhom with the Father, and the halie Ghaiſt, be all honor, praiſe, and glorie, for nowe and euer:
               Amen.
