            To the tune of, I'le neuer loue thee more.
            
            
               
            
            
               
            
            
               
                  A Young man lately did complaine
               becauſe that he was wed:
               And counſel'd others to abſtaine
               from Hymeneal bed:
               Had years but giuen him man-like thoughts,
               he'ed not bin ſo vnwiſe,
               For wiues increaſe mans happines,
               then T'is not otherwiſe.
               
            
            
               What ioy is there vpon the earth
               but Mariage makes it more,
               It is to man a ſecond birth.
               and openeth the doore
               To happines, and ſuch delight▪
               
               that none but they comprize:
               They pleaſures haue both day and night,
               then t'is not otherwiſe.
               
            
            
               When I was ſingle I did ſtray
               in heart, in words, and life,
               But I haue found a better way
               I thanke my louing wife:
               I now liue frée from all ſuſpect,
               and many wicked lyes,
               The good I wiſht, hath tooke effect,
               then t'is not otherwiſe.
               
            
            
               Much company I vſ'd to keepe,
               before I had a wife,
               The memory doth make me wéepe,
               for t'was a wicked life:
               Such comfort now at home I finde,
               from Mariage to ariſe,
               I wiſh all men were in my minde,
               then t'is not otherwiſe.
               
            
            
               Vnthrifty games I now haue left
               as Tables, Cards and Dice,
               That oft hath me of wealth bereft,
               I curſe no Ace, nor Sice:
               I do not now the Cards bid burne,
               that made my anger riſe,
               A wife hath cauſed me to turne
               then t'is not otherwiſe
               
            
            
               So ciuill I am growne of late
               ſince that I made my choice,
               I hate each ſwearing ſwaggering mate,
               which makes me to reioyce:
               The company I now do keepe,
               are honeſt men and wiſe,
               That not with drinke, but ſence do ſléepe,
               then t'is not otherwiſe.
               
            
            
               No Conſtable nor watch frare I,
               that cryeth Who goes there?
               
               I doe not reele, but ſoberly
               can paſſe them daid of care:
               I vſe no candels in the morne,
               I drinke not out mine eyes,
               My wife hath made me theſe to ſcorne,
               then t'is not otherwiſe.
               
            
            
               This diet makes me to forget
               the head-ach that ſome haue,
               Which makes them for all things vnfit,
               (to drinke I am no ſlaue.)
               Thoſe men their vertue hath out-worne,
               that drinke doth ſo diſguiſe,
               My wife hath made me this to ſcorne,
               then t'is not otherwiſe.
            
            
               The ſecond part.
               To the ſame tune.
               
                  
               
               
                  
               
               
                  AGainſt I from my labour come,
                  my wife prouides me meat:
                  When I was ſingle none at home,
                  found I, or what to eate.
                  At ſight of me ſhe layes the cloath,
                  and then for me at ſhe hies,
                  Which makes me to forget all floath,
                  then t'is not otherwiſe.
                  
               
               
                  If I ſeeme diſcontent with ought,
                  ſhe kindly prayes me tell,
                  If that it may be beg'd or bought,
                  (or where it is to ſell:)
                  That would me pleaſe, & merry make:
                  the teares ſtand in her eyes
                  Till I my diſcontent forſake:
                  then t'is not otherwiſe.
                  
               
               
                  It is a comfort for to ſée,
                  good women meeke and mild,
                  That to her come in charity,
                  when that ſhe is with child:
                  They comfort her if ſhe do ſound,
                  one for ſtrong water hies,
                  And ſo their husbands healths drinke round,
                  then t'is not otherwiſe.
                  
               
               
                  When that ſhe doth in child-bed lye.
                  the neighbours in their loue,
                  Will with her fit, and pleaſantly
                  to mirth they doe hee moue:
                  By chriſtning of my little lad
                  I did in credit riſe:
                  All this by my good wife I had,
                  then t'is not otherwiſe.
                  
               
               
                  For goſſiping they ſend in meat,
                  would well ſerue forty men.
                  As good as any man can eate,
                  for mutton, pig, or hen;
                  They eate not halfe but leaue it me,
                  there profit doth ariſe:
                  This cometh by a wife you ſée,
                  then t'is not otherwiſe.
                  
               
               
                  One giues a peece, and one a ſpoon
                        •
                     
                  
                  vnto my pretty childe,
                  And wiſh that ere to morrow noone,
                  their cradles to be fil'd
                  With ſuch a pretty child as this:
                  ioy there to me doth riſe,
                  Had I no wife all this I miſſe,
                  then t'is not otherwiſe.

                  I with it play with great delight,
                  and huſh it when it cryes,
                  And euer wiſh it in my ſight,
                  then t'is not otherwiſe.
