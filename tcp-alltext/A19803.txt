                  I
                Haue bin deſirous, Right honorable, and that of long tyme, vvith many other to vvhom your moſt godly diſpoſition hath bin often reported, not only to congratulate, but alſo to honor the ſame vvith ſome poore teſtimonie of myne vnfeined good vvill And novv occaſion ſumdeale fauourably grauntyng vnto my requeſt, hope hath alſo pricked mee forevvarde to myne attempt, that no ſtudie or traueill vvherby the true knovvledge & feare of God is to bee learned, can come vnvvelcome, or ſeeme diſhonorable vnto your honour. If noneother examples, yet the vndoubted vvord of life vvorthily Engliſhed and ſet foorth vnder your Right Honorable protection, doth ſufficiently prooue: beeſides your moſt feruent zeale in embracing true Religion, and aduauncing the ſyncere vvorſhipping of Almightie God, by meanes vvhereof your fame is ſpread far among forreine nations. Thus am I not diſcouraged, but rather hartened, ſemblably vvith duetie to offer this my ſimple trauell vnto your honour, beeing the vvoorthy vvoorke of the learned Diuine M. Lambert Danaeus of Geneua, concerning

Christian Naturall Philoſophie, & the vvonderfull vvoorkemanſhip of this vvorld. A vvoorke doubtleſſe of great auaill, to the knovvledge of God in his creatures. A vvorke of vvonderfull efficacie, to ſet foorth the honour and glorie of God the Creator. A vvoorke of merueilous force to ſtirre vp mens mindes to the contemplation of true knovvledge and learning, vvhiche is gathered out of the holy Scriptures only. A vvoork of rare effect to declare the prayſe of God the vvoorkman, and to establiſhe aſſured fayth, and true religion. To bee ſhort, a vvoorke ſo farre ſurpaſſing all other vvoorkes of like argument, vvriten either by Chriſtian or Heathen Philoſophers, as the proofes and auctorities vſed by them both bee differing: the one beeyng founded vppon the aſſured ground of Gods vvoord and holy Scriptures, the other eſtabliſhed vpon the fickle foundation of mans reaſon & iudgement. This vvoorke therefore, Right Honorable, ſo profitable, ſo pleaſant, ſo neceſſarie, ſo full of varietie of Godly matter, ſo ſubſtancially grounded by vvarrant of Scriptures, ſo ſurely confirmed by auctoritie of Doctours and Fathers, in moſt humble and duetifull maner I preſent vnto your honor. Hoping, that as in the Latine it hath bin generally liked of the learned, ſo likevviſe you vvill not miſlike that it novv go abroad in the Engliſhe tōgue vnder the protection of your Right Honorable name, by him vvho reſteth your honours moſt hūble at cōmaundement:

               To the right honourable, the Lord Friderike of Nachod, Lorde of Danouiz and of Beſke, &c. his verie good Lorde and Patrone.
            
               AVncient and noble is the queſtion concernyng the originall of the worlde, and firſte beeginning of all things, Right honorable Baron, which hath not only long tyme and much troubled the wittes of the Philoſophers, but alſo of Chriſtians, & in the end by reaſon of the diuerſe iudgements of men hath reſted ſo doubtfull, that many graue writers coulde not tell what to determine therin. For amōg the Chriſtiās, Origen, in his bookes of the beginnings (which bookes aboue the reſidue moſt men do iudge to bee his woorthy woork) and they which after him wrote the Examera, are ſo diuided in opinions, that nothing may ſeeme certeinly to bee gathered out of their writinges. But among the Philoſophers, men ignorant of God and his trueth, there is farre more diuerſitie of opinions, ſo that concernyng this matter a man may better gheaſſe than vnderſtand by their doctrine what hee hath to follow. Now touchyng theſe Philoſophers, perhaps there is no ſuch cauſe to wonder at their blindnes in ſo great a matter, and that thei were ſo deepely drowned in darknes, foraſmuch as they were deſtitute of Gods woord, that is to ſay, the true light of knowledge. But among Chriſtians ſuche diſoorde and diſagreement cannot with like vprightnes bee excuſed, for that there is but one way of the trueth, wherof they might haue found moſt aſſured groundes in the woord of God, if they had had regard therto. What was thā the cauſe of ſo greate diſagreement among the Chriſtians concernyng this matter? Forſooth it was the Heathen Philoſophie, with the preceptes wherof they were not onely then inſtructed and infected, but many alſo of them beeing ſtuffed, bee witched and deceiued therwith, (in reſpect that they aſcribed moſtvnto this art) would graunt and admit nothyng whiche they ſuppoſed to bee repugnant to the principles thereof. And this miſcheif did not onely continue in the tyme of our forefathers, and the firſte

age of the Churche, whiche many hauing learned in the ſchooles of the Philoſophers euen in their tender yeeres, and afterward beeing conuerted to the faith of Chriſt, could not eaſily lay doune and chaunge thoſe opinions whiche they had receiued beefore, and of long tyme moſt ſtudiouſly embraced. Yea now, ſince the name of the Philoſophers is extinguiſhed, it cannot bee plucked out of the minds of many that would bee called Chriſtians: ſo deepely forſooth the admiration and reuerence of this Heathen Philoſophie is imprinted within the mindes of ſome men, and of ſo great a force it is, as the Prouerbe fayeth, in tender youth, and as it were with the Mothers milke, to accuſtome a mans ſelf vnto errour, as it were vnto the preceptes of trueth. And therefore I doe not doubt, but that this my woorke concerning Chriſtian Naturall Philoſophie, that is to ſay, how to refourme the opiniōs of the Philoſophers by the woord of God, ſhalbee reprooued of many, and therfore hath need of ſome noble and great perſonage, that is welbecloued among all eſtaſtes, to bee patrone vnto it, by whoſe auctoritie beeing defended, and fauour cōmended, it may ſafely and acceptably come abroade into mens hands to bee read. You only, right honorable, are hee vnto whoſe name therefore I dedicate the ſame, how far ſoeuer I bee diſioyned from you by diſtance of place. And as for your honour, there wanteth nothyng in you, that may ſuffice to diſcomfite the force of all enemies, if ſo bee that you can well like of this woork, and doe accept it vnto your protection. For if it might pleaſe you to oppoſe that ſame your moſte ſingulare and true Chriſtian godlines of minde, againſt the old and ſtubburne crue of heathen men concerning this part of Philoſophie, in reſpect that you do ſyncerely and purely woorſhippe God by direction of his vndoubted woord, weighyng and examinyng euery thing accordyng to that as a moſt certeine rule: there is no man that doubteth but that there is more credite to be giuen vnto your iudgement, than to all the rabble of thoſe blind Philoſophers. But as touching other, I will obiect your greate honour and auctoritie for a ſhielde beetweene them and mee for my defence, whiche auctoritie of yours beeyng by you purchaſed in the ſight of all men by meanes of infinite benefites by you beeſtowed vpon the Churches of Boheme and Morauia, is farre and wide renouined in the mouthes of all people, and knowne vnto thoſe nations that know not your perſon: whiche alſo is eaſily able by the excellencie thereof to put

to ſilence the ſlaunderous tongues of certein light perſons. And whereas all men whiche know you, doe graunt and confeſſe, that I doe not falſly attribute theſe prayſes vnto you, then your moſte noble Sunne, and no leſſe heire to your vertues, than ſucceſſour to your goodes, Iohn George, prooueth and declareth the ſame. VVho both of hys owne naturall inclination, and by the inſtruction and diligence of the right learned and godly man Vuenceſlaus Lauanus his ſcholemaſter, beeyng the expreſſe patterne and image of your vertue, how greate the ſame vertues bee in you, may bee by euery man eaſily perceiued. And truely, all wee that liue heere, profeſſe that wee are mutch beeholden vnto you for this cauſe, for that you haue giuen vs a pleadge of youre ſingulare loue towardes vs, namely your Sunne, at whoſe handes wee expect all good things. And in that you would haue this notable teſtimony of the agreement of your Churches with ours in the true and auncient fayth, to bee extant in the ſight of all men: which that it may continually ſo remaine, and neuer bee broken of through any contention amongeſt men, wee ceaſe not to make our prayers to Almightie God. And that ſame deſire whiche is in you to deſerue well of all nations bee they neuer ſo farre of, is not only a ſingulare vertue, but alſo moſt worthy of a Chriſtiā, which aboue all other is moſt familiar and proper vnto you. And although you doe farre excell in nobilitie of birthe, as deſcendyng from the moſt auncient houſe of the Nachoſij (whom I ſuppoſe to bee the onely remainders of the moſte renoumed ſtock of the Nariſci) and alſo of the moſte ſtout and martiall family of the Moranians (who are ſucceſſours to the people called Marcomanni, that were ſumtyme fearefull enemies to the Romanes, yea when they were in their moſt floriſhyng ſtate) amōg whom you enioye very large poſſeſſions: notwithſtanding your greate humanitie and gentlenes which is vnto you a peculiare vertue, ſhal farre more excellently aduaunce your name among al ages. And as touchyng my booke, I had rather it were knowne by the effect it ſelfe, than by my report, what and how greate the commoditie thereof is. How beeit this will I ſay in fewe woordes, that therein I haue breifly comprehended whatſoeuer I coulde reade to haue binne diſputed by the auncient and holy Fathers, either againſt the Philoſophers, or Heretikes: and that I haue not intermingled any queſtion which they haue not handled beefore: neither haue omitted any thing whiche ſeemed might ſtande in

ſteede towardes the vnderſtanding of their writinges. Wherein I will plainly confeſſe vnto you, I haue not ſo mutch ſtudied to ſatiſfie the humour of curious perſons, as to aduaunce the commoditie of ſtudious young men. And therfore I hope it will come to paſſe, that your honours moſte noble Sunne the Lord Iohn, with other young Princes, beeyng mooued by your auctoritie, will follow ſutch kindes of ſtudies whiche they ſhall perceiue to bee acceptable, and that woorthily, vnto ſo greate eſtates. Fare you well.

            AN EXCELLENT DISCOVRSE OF CHRISTIAN NATURALL PHILOSOPHIE.
            
               
                  ¶The firſt Chapiter. ¶What naturall Philoſophie is, and how many kindes there bee thereof.
               
                  S.
                  
                     WHat is naturall Philoſophie?
               
               
                  M.
                  It is the true knowledge or diſcourſe concerning the Creation and diſtinction of all this whole worlde with the partes therof, of the cauſes by whiche it was ſo wrought, and likewiſe of the effectes whiche followe thereon, apperteinyng to the praiſe of God the Creatour.
               
               
                  S.
                  From whence do you gather this your definition?
               
               
                  M.
                  Specially out of twoo places of holie ſcripture, wherof the firſt is the. 30. chapt. and 4. verſe of the Prouerbes. The other the firſt chapiter of Geneſis, in whiche thoſe fower poinctes are briefly recited, vnto whiche alſo that place maie bee added whiche is in the 7. Chapter and 17. and 18. verſes, where it is euidently declared, that ſuche thinges bee handled in this Science.
               
               
                  S.
                  Is this knowledge termed by this name onely, or is it called by ſome other alſo?
               
               
                  
                  M.
                  Yea truely. For out of S. Paule it maie bee called The knowledge of Gods woorkes, Rom.
                      the 1. chap. and 20. verſe. Out of the Epiſtle to the Hebrewes, The knowledge ofſeculare thynges.
                      And finally wee maie as fitly and conueniently call it The knowledge of thinges created, as naturall Philoſophie was ſo called Of the ſearchyng of Nature, if ſo bee that the vſe of that name had bin familiar, and receiued by the Greekes and Latines.
               
               
                  S.
                  Why then, doe you call it naturall Philoſophie, which is a woorde vſed by the Heathen Philoſophers?
               
               
                  M.
                  For twoo cauſes. The firſte is, for that Chriſtians ought not to bee ſo ſcrupulous, or rather ſuperſtitious, that thei ſhould bee afeard to vſe ſuche common woordes and names as the Heathē doe, for ſomuche as with them wee do vſe and enioy the ſelf ſame Sū, aire, earth, water, light, meates, and Cities. Neither doeth the Scripture it ſelf refuſe that woorde as vnſeemely or monſtrous, as appeareth in the 2. chapiter and 3. verſe to the Epheſians, and the 1. Chapiter and 5. verſe of the ſeconde Epiſtle of S. Peter. Alſo the auncient and Catholike fathers in euery place, doe terme this knowledge of thynges by the name of Naturall Philoſophie, as did Baſile, Chriſoſtome, Ambroſe, Auguſtine in his Enchiridion to Laurence: Naturall Philoſophers,
                      ſaieth hee, are thei that ſearche the nature of thynges. Secondly, that for as muche as this woorde, Nature, in the common vſe of the Greeke tongue, is, for the moſte parte, applied to ſuche thynges as doe conſiſte, not of eſſence onely, of whiche ſorte GOD is, but are compounded with certein accidentes adioined, ſuche as are all the thynges that wee beholde with our eyes, and whereof this viſible worlde conſiſteth: that knowledge ſeemeth

moſte properly to bee termed naturall Philoſophie, whiche is buſied in the handlyng of the mixt, cō
                     poūded, and materiall thinges, that it maie bee diſtinguiſhed from Diuinitie. Wherefore, Naturall Philoſophie, ſaie thei, is the knowledged of Materiall and Inſtrumentall beginnynges.
               
               
                  S.
                  How many ſortes are there of naturall Philoſophie?
               
               
                  M.
                  Twoo: the one Generall, the other Particulare.
               
               
                  S.
                  Whiche is the Generall part?
               
               
                  M.
                  That whiche entreateth of the Generall and moſte principall partes of the worlde, with their originall, nature, and cauſes: ſuche are heauen and the fower elementes, for that theſe, in reſpect of the other partes, are, as it were, the firſt beeginnynges, and principles, and cauſes of their beeyng and compoundyng: And likewiſe that is the Generall part of naturall Philoſophie, which ſheweth vs the generall maner and order of preſeruyng and increaſyng of all thynges, beecauſe it deliuereth vnto vs all thynges in generall. And theſe poinctes, for the more part, are comprehended in the firſt chapiter of Geneſis.
                  
               
               
                  S.
                  Whiche is then the Particulare part?
               
               
                  M.
                  That whiche diligently ſetteth doune the peculiare natures, operations, properties, and effectes of euery kinde, which are ſeuerally diſtinguiſhed in theſe created and viſible thynges, as for example: What is the Nature of a Man, what of an Horſe, what of euery kinde of liuyng Creature, with the operations alſo of Trees and Hearbes. Theſe thynges are partly conteined in the rules of Phiſick, and partly alſo in thoſe treatiſes whiche by the Auctours thereof are intitled by the names of Hiſtories of liuyng thynges, and of

Plantes, and ſuche like: certaine partes whereof and ſparkes are founde ſhinyng heere and there diſperſed in holie Scripture, as it were beautifull precious ſtones. Howbeit the whole hiſtorie & general diſcourſe of theſe thinges is not conteined in the Scripture: ſince that Salomons Bookes whiche were written copiouſly of the Nature of all thynges, are, through the negligence of men, periſhed.
               
            
            
               
                  ¶ The ſeconde Chapiter. Whether Naturall Philoſophie bee meete for a Chriſtian?
               
                  S.
                  
                     IS there any profite in Naturall Philoſophie?
               
               
                  M.
                  Yea, manifolde. But that I may not run ouer them all, for thei are almoſte infinite I wil alledge fiue onely. The firſt is, that thereby wee knowe God, not onely to bee the Creator of all thinges, but alſo to bee euerlaſting, omnipotent, and mercifull, &c. The ſeconde, that by it wee learne the thynges that are created, with their operations and natures. The third, for that therein wee ſee ourſelues and perceiue what wee are, of what thynges and partes wee conſiſt, and eche part of ours, that is to ſaie, what maner of thing our Soule is, and what likewiſe is the ſtate and condition of our bodie: which all men do confeſſe to bee the beſt, profitablieſt, & moſte excellēt knowledge of all other. The iiii. that wonderyng at in our myndes, and beholdyng with our eyes theſe woorkes of God, ſo greate, ſo many, ſo wonderfull, beyng thervnto holpē by none other meanes than by this Arte, wee are with greate zeale and affection

ſtirred vp to ſet foorth the won̄derfull praiſes of God and to giue him thankes. Whiche thing happened alſo vnto Galene, yea, although he were a prophane Philoſopher, that after hee had deſcribed the Nature of one of Gods woorkes, that is to ſaie, of Man, and the partes of his bodie, hee was enforced, yea, almoſte againſt his will, to ſyng an Himne to God. Heerehence it commeth that ſuche multitude of hymnes, ſo many Epodes and ſonges of praiſe, ſo many Pſalmes are written and celebrated. The v. that wee vnderſtandyng theſe thinges, maie eaſily and plainly expounde, and freely enter into many places of holie Scripture, whiche vnto ſuche as bee ignorante of theſe matters, are not onely obſcure, but alſo cannot poſſibly bee attained vnto, or by any meanes vnderſtoode. Wherefore S. Auguſtine writeth, that Naturall Philoſophie is verie profitable and neceſſarie for a chriſten diuine. What ſhall I ſpeake of the ſingulare pleaſure whiche this knowledge bringeth vnto ye minde, & of the great cōmodities whiche it miniſtreth vnto the life of man?
               
               
                  S.
                  How doe you prooue theſe thinges to bee true?
               
               
                  M.
                  Specially out of theſe places of holie ſcripture. The whole 104 Pſalme. The 136. and 145. Pſalme, & 10. verſe. The 147. and 148. Pſalmes. Iob the 12. chapiter and verſe 8. 9. 10. and the 36. Chapiter, and 24. 25. 26. verſes. The 14. Chapiter of the Actes, and 17. verſe. The firſt Chapiter to the Romanes, and 20. verſe. Unto theſe moreouer maie bee added the 7. Chapiter of the booke of Wiſedome, and 9. verſe, with the nexte followyng: and likewiſe the 13. Chapiter and 1. verſe, and the nexte followyng. Likewiſe the holie Fathers S. Baſill, S. Chriſoſtome, & S. Ambroſe in their Exameron, or

woorke of ſixe daies doc teache the ſame thyng: And moreouer the holie and abſolutely learned father S. Auguſtine in his booke of chriſtian doctrine, and in the viii. booke of Gene. vpon the letter, the viii. chapiter.
               
               
                  S.
                  But there be certain obiections made, declaryng that the knowledge of Naturall Philoſophie is not onely vnprofitable, but alſo vnwoorthie for a chriſtian, yea, that it is hurtfull, and dangerous for hym.
               
               
                  M.
                  Yea truely. And although many men haue gathered ſundrie, yet all of thē maie bee referred ſpecially vnto twoo kindes of argumentes, whiche are alledged againſte the knowledge of theſe thynges: whereof the firſte is framed ab auctoritate, from auctoritie. The ſecond, a ratione & turpi, from reaſon and vnſeemelineſſe, or from a moſte hurtfull conſequent.
               
               
                  S.
                  Declare them.
               
               
                  M.
                  Firſt, thei gather ſundrie ſentences, partly out of the Scriptures, and partly out of the Eccleſiaſticall Fathers, out of whiche afterwarde thei frame their reaſons, and make their concluſions.
               
               
                  S.
                  Whiche bee thei?
               
               
                  M.
                  Out of holie ſcripture this is ſpecially alledged, which is written in the Booke of Eccleſiaſtes, or of the Preacher, the 1. Chapiter, and 15. verſe in theſe woordes: I ſet my harte to ſeeke and to finde out with wiſedome, whatſoeuer thyng is doone vnder heauen. This euill exerciſe hath GOD giuen to the Sonnes of men, to occupie them ſelues therein Unto whiche thei ioyne that ſaiyng of S. Paule the 1. to the Corinthians, the 1. Chapiter, and 20. verſe: God hath made fooliſhe the wiſedome of this worlde: with other ſuche places like vnto theſe: whiche maie eaſely bee anſwered.
               
               
                  S.
                  How I praie you?
               
               
                  
                  M.
                  Forſoothe, that that in the Booke of the Preacher is not ſpoken abſolutely, but onely in compariſon of the true woorſhippyng of God. Neither doeth Salomon cō
                     demne or diſprooue the true knowledge of the nature of thinges, whiche GOD gaue vnto hym as a greate benefite of all other moſte ſurpaſſyng (for then ſhould hee haue bin of all men the moſte vnthankfulleſt man to God) and in reſpecte whereof, hee was then greatly eſteemed of by the Queene of Saba, and other Princes neere vnto hym. Howbeeit this knowledge of Naturall Philoſophie, if it bee compared with true Godlineſſe, if with faithe, if with the true feare of GOD, if with inwarde regeneration of the mynde, if with the knowledge of euerlaſtyng life and ſaluation, ſurely in compariſon of theſe thynges, it is but a light buſiyng of the minde, vnfruitfull, rather weariyng vs, then relieuyng or comfortyng our conſciences. For it bryngeth not the true felicitie, as faithe to Godwardes doeth, although a manne conſume his whole life in it, and as it were, tyre his minde aboute it. And as touchyng the place of S. Paule, I ſee not how it oppugneth the knowledge of Naturall Philoſophie, ſeeyng S. Paule condemneth the wiſedome of the worlde, not the wiſedome concernyng the worlde, and thynges created. But that is called the wiſedome of the world, whiche is wholy ruled by the counſell and iudgement of the ſinfull and blinde fleſhe, and therevpon repoſeth it ſelf: not that whiche diſcreetly and as farre as neede requireth, diſcourſeth of the cauſes of thinges.
               
               
                  S.
                  But what alledge thei out of the writynges of the fathers, to driue vs from this kinde of

                  M.
                  It were an infinite thyng to goe about to report their ſaiynges, but I will onely recite a fewe.
               
               
                  S.
                  Rehearſe them, I praie you.

                     Lactantius in his third booke and viii. chapiter, writeth thus: What felicitie ſhall I atteine vnto, if I knowe where Nilus riſeth, or whatſoeuer the naturall Philoſophers do doate concernyng heauen? yea, moreouer there is no certein knowledge of thoſe thinges, but onely opinion, whiche alſo is variable accordyng to the varietie of mennes wittes. S. Auguſtine alſo is cōmended, who in his fourth Booke de Trinitate, of the Trinitie, in the Preface writeth thus: That minde is more to be commended which knoweth it owne infirmitie, rather than that, whiche not perceiuyng the ſame, ſearcheth after the motions of the Planets, and the walles of the worlde, the foundations of the earth, and the top of the heauens. And that I maie not touche euery thyng, in his Booke de ſpiritu & anima, of the ſpirite and the ſoule, the 56. chapiter, hee plainly alſo ſetteth doune the ſame.
               
               
                  S.
                  Can you anſwere theſe aucthorities?
               
               
                  M.
                  Yea.
               
               
                  S.
                  How I praie you?
               
               
                  M.
                  That theſe thynges are alſo ſpoken by the fathers in compariſō, as it appeereth out of the ſame place of S. Auguſtine, whom you erewhile cōmended. For the Fathers reproued the diſordered ſtudies of men, whiche wee ſee alſo now a daies to reſte in many, and that in Chriſtians: who contēnyng the doctrine of ſaluation and neglecting the ſtudie of the veritie of the Goſpell, whiche is ſet for the in a ſimple ſtile, conuert themſelues wholy vnto theſe ſwellyng and puffed Artes of Naturall Philoſophie, addietyng them ſelues vnto them, and openly preferryng the ambicious name of a naturall Philoſopher, before Chriſtiā godlineſſe, and

Diuinitie. Wherfore, the Fathers, to the intent to reuoke men from this ſo greate an errour, haue vttered muche matter againſte Naturall Philoſophers, and their Art, and their opinions, and that truely, as haue S. Baſill, & S. Chriſoſtome in their Exameron, or woork of ſixe daies. Howbeeit thei doe not condemne the true knowledge of thoſe thinges, whiche certain amongſt them were verie ſkilfull in, and moſte perfect.
               
               
                  S.
                  Whiche is the other argument, whiche you ſaid was taken, a conſequenti, of the conſequente, and alledged againſt naturall Philoſophie?
               
               
                  M.
                  That truely which S. Baſile reciteth to be alledged by ſlouthfull and idle perſones, therby to colour their filthie ignorance.
               
               
                  S.
                  What is that?
               
               
                  M.
                  That the wounderfull miracle of the creation of the worlde, is debaſed and made vile, wherein notwithſtanding the greate power, maieſtie, and wiſedome of God appeareth & is laid before our eyes to bee woorſhipped: if wee bee able to ſette it doune in any arte or Methode, and if it maie bee ſaied that ſo greate a miſterie maie bee comprehended. For what other thyng were that (ſaie thei) than to feigne our ſelues not onely to bee able to comprehend the woorkes of God, whiche doubtleſſe are ſupernaturall and Diuine, but alſo to make vs iudges, & as it were Cenſores thereof. And finally to make God, as it were, a Grammarian, ſubiect vnto certein lawes of Nature, and Arte.
               
               
                  S.
                  What anſwere you vnto that?
               
               
                  M.
                  Truly euen that which in the ſame place, S. Baſile the beſt learned amongſt the Greek writers, anſwereth.
               
               
                  S.
                  What ſaieth hee?
               
               
                  
                  M.
                  That thereby, this miracle of God, which appeareth in the Creation of the worlde, is more manifeſtly aduaunced, and by vs more religiouſly adored, by howe muche the more it is diſtinctly declared, wherby is ſet forthe the greater commoditie and force thereof. And to the end yt you maie vnderſtand this to bee true by another example, Gods decree concernyng our ſaluation, is it not commoly tearmed in the Scriptures, Gods ſecrete and miſterie? And verely it is ſo, wherein the Maieſtie and Wiſedome of GOD is propoſed vnto vs, no leſſe than in the creatiō of the worlde: and yet notwithſtandyng Faithe or the Goſpell, ſetteth it forthe to our view ſo plainly, ſo orderly, and diſtinctly, that nothyng can bee more: Notwithſtandyng the worſhippyng of God is nothyng thereby diminiſhed in that wee comprehende it by Art, and by a Theologicall Methode, but rather by ſo muche the more better and ardently wee praiſe GOD, by how much the more commodiouſly and diſtinctly wee atteine to the vnderſtandyng of theſe things. And to bee ſhort, faith it ſelf through which God will bee worſhipped, is not a certein ignorance or a confuſed imagination concernyng God, but a cleare and reſ
                        •••
                     te vnderſtanding of the minde, whiche directly anſwereth vnto ſuche queſtions as are demaunded touching God, and his infinite mercie towardes mankinde. Vnknowen things are vndeſired, as the old Prouerbe ſaieth. Wherefore, whenas the Hiſtorie of the creatiō of the worlde is ſet forth by art, when the vertues whiche God hath giuen vnto thinges are declared Gods: Miracle is not diminiſhed, but augmēted. Neither do wee ſet doune theſe things, as though wee did profeſſe that we would alledge

any other cauſes of theſe naturall thynges, beſides the will and wiſedome of GOD onely: Or that through them wee can acknowledge or conteine ſo much in our minde as is the power of God in creating, and his goodnes in preſeruing them. Or els as though wee went about to ſhewe, that our great and good God, the cheife gouernour of all thinges, were ſubiect to any of our lawes or decres: but onely profitably to buſie our ſelues in ſetting forth of Gods woorkes ſo farre as wee may bee holpen by art, and as it were, through a glaſſe which looketh into thys ſchoole of the nature of thinges, to keepe ſuch as are leſſe heedefull, in the noble contemplation of them.
               
            
            
               
                  The thirde Chapter. From whence the knowledge of the Generall naturall Phyloſophie is to bee had moſt ſafely.

                  M.
                  The next is, that wee diſcuſſe from whēce this knowledge is to bee drawn & taken, bycauſe in this point wee diſagree from certein, who ſuppoſe that it maye more ſafely and certeinly bee deriued out of ye bookes of prophane Philoſophers, thā the holy Scriptures: in that they ſaye that it is not all ſet foorth in the Scripture, and if haply there bee anye parte thereof conteined therein, it is confuſedly handled, not by any art or order.
               
               
                  S.
                  From whence then, doe you iudge, maye the knowledge of naturall Philoſophie moſt conueniently bee taken?
               
               
                  
                  M.
                  Uerily of that part which beefore wee tearmed generall naturall Philoſophie the knowledge is chiefly to bee learned out of holy Scripture. And of that which wee called Particular out of the woorkes of Phiſitions, or of others which haue written the hiſtories of Plantes, and of lyuinge thinges.
               
               
                  S.
                  How proue you that?
               
               
                  M.
                  Firſt I ſuppoſe, this is agreed vpō by all men of ſoūd iudgement, that euery workman can beſt and trulieſt talke and diſpute in his owne Art, and that hee is rather to bee beleeued therin than any other. But what woorkmans woorkmanſhip, thincke you, is thys worlde? Is it any others than Gods onely? ſo that wee ought to beleeue none rather than him, who in hys woorde teacheth vs the maner and order of framinge his woorke, that is to ſaye, the worlde. To bee ſhorte, who knoweth, ſeeth, and vnderſtandeth more truely the cauſes of all things, their properties, effectes, the maner of their beeing, & the times when firſt they began, then hee who is the maker of them all, and the perpetuall gouernour of them all? who beeing GOD, and ſence hee him ſelfe telleth theſe thinges, what man will at anye time bee ſo mad, but to thinke that hee is rather to bee harkened vnto in thys reſpect and all other writers to bee neglected? Truely wee, as alſo all other Philoſophers, howſoeuer ſurpaſſing in wit, & abounding in leaſure, what ſoeuer diligence they employed in ſtudy, yet could neuer neither wee nor they attayne vnto certaine obſcure ſlender ſparkes of naturall Philoſophie. And whatſoeuer we define cōcerning theſe matters without the woorde of God, it is ſo vncerteine, doubtfull,

variable, and contrarie to it ſelfe, and many times ſo contrarie to the trueth that in the ende wee are aſhamed that wee either learned ſo, or taught ſo: which may appeare to be true, if it wer but only out of Plutarchus booke De Placitis Philoſophorum, Of the opinions of Philoſophers: whereas that excellent learned man, and great Philoſopher ſheweth yt neuer two of them agreed in the knowledge of the things yt are created.
               
               
                  S.
                  Can you confirme the trueth of your opinion, by the auchoritie of Gods woord, to wit, that this knowledge may well and ſafely bee learned out of the holy ſcriptures?
               
               
                  M.
                  Yeas verily.
               
               
                  S.
                  Recite them I pray you.
               
               
                  M.
                  The firſt teſtimonie, is that which is writen euidently in the epiſtle to the Hebrues in theſe woords: Through Faith wee vnderſtande, that the worlde was made by the woorde of God. Wherefore wee vnderſtande theſe thinges by Faith. If by Faith, then by the holy ſcripture, for ther can bee no faith without the ſcripture. And therfore wee muſt certainely conclude, that the true and certeine knowledge concerninge theſe matters, is declared vnto vs by the holy ſcripture. The ſeconde aucthoritie is the 1. chapter of Geneſis. For Moſes, who at the commaundement and appointment of God wrot that hiſtorie of all other moſt excellent and wounderfull, of the beginninge of the worlde, and creation of all thinges, is either a vaine fellowe, or a lier, if the knowledge of naturall Philoſophie be not conteined in the holy Scripture. For what other thing doth hee in that booke, than briefly, howbeit truely and orderly, ſet downe the originall of thinges, and theyr

vertues, natures, and effectes, that is to ſay, Naturall Philoſophie? The thyrde is, a place in the Prouerbes the viii. Chapiter, and the 20. verſe, & the nexte folowinge, where it is ſaied, that all thinges were created by the wyſdome of God, and afterwarde as they were created, ſo are they preſerued. The fourth aucthoritie, is alleaged out of the 42. Chapiter, and 17. verſe of Eccleſiaſt. This wiſdome hath God giuen to his Sainctes,
                      (ſaith hee,) that they might recoumpt all his miracles and workes, and ſearch them all, yea hell it ſelfe &c. wherevnto wee may adde that which is written in the vii. chapiter of the booke of VViſedom the 22. verſe, and the next folowing. Finally, let vs heare the moſte holye Martyr of God, and good Father Irenaeus, who in his ſeconde booke, and 2. Chapter ſaithe thus: To whom therefore shall wee giue more credit concerning the framing of the worlde: to thoſe that wee ſpake of beefore ſo iangling in folly and inconſtancie, or to the Diſciples of the Lorde, and the ſeruant and Prophet of God Moſes, who firſt reuealed the creation of the worlde? The ſelfe ſame thing S. Baſell, and S. Ambroſe, and S. Chriſoſtome in the prefaces of their Exameron or Six dayes woorke, doe with one conſent, and plainely confirme, ſo that whoſo ſhall deney that the knowledge of Naturall Philoſophie may not truely and commod
                        •
                     ouſly bee learned out of holy ſcripture, gainſaith the ſacred woorde of GOD, and openly repugneth againſt the learned Fathers. In concluſiō, hearken to 
                        
                           •
                        ertullian, who in the 46. chapter of hys Apologet: doth truely and plainly pronounce, that the ſacred woorde of God, which is moſt auncient, was as it were, the treaſurie and ſtoarehouſe vnto all later wiſdom. From thence, ſaith hee, the Philoſophers haue quenched
                     
                     the thirſt of their wits. But as men that were ouer riotous in the ſtudy onely of glorie and eloquence, if they found any thyng in holy ſcripture, when they had digeſted it according to the purpoſe of their curioſitie, they conuerted it to their owne woorkes.
                  
               
               
                  S.
                  Doe they that are of the contrarie opinion, bring nothing againſt thys?
               
               
                  M.
                  Yeas, two argumentes eſpecially.
               
               
                  S.
                  What bee they?
               
               
                  M.
                  This is the firſt. That the ende of euery art ought to bee diſtinguiſhed, and that Naturall Philoſophie is one thing, and Diuinitie another: whereof thys laſt is conteined in holie write, but the other is not ſo.
               
               
                  S.
                  Is that conſequent, and aſſertion true?
               
               
                  M.
                  No verily.
               
               
                  S.
                  Howe ſo?
               
               
                  M.
                  For that, although they gather that truly, that artes ought to bee diſtinguiſhed, and that Diuinitie, which conteineth the promiſes of euerlaſtinge lyfe, teaching alſo the waye thervnto, and the cauſes thereof, ought to bee ſeparated from Naturall Philoſophie, whiche entreateth of the framinge of this viſible worlde, and the natures of all thinges in the ſame: yet doe they not ſay truely, in denyinge that the order of the creation of this world, the ſundrie kindes of things, their natures, & manifold ſortes are taught, diſtinguiſhed, and orderly ſet downe in holy Scripture. All theſe thinges are copiouſly declared there, which are the peculiar ſubiect & matter of the Art of Natural Philoſophie. Wherefore Naturall Philoſophie is comprehended in holy ſcripture. The ſame alſo you may learne by another example: are not Diuinitie and the morall parte of Philoſophie, both of them as they differ

in kinde diſcerned in the holy ſcriptures? And yet who is ſo raſbe and foliſhe, that he dare deny that the Ethike or moral Philoſophie, yea and that moſt truly and generally is deliuered vnto vs in holie ſcripture? wherefore the diſtinct endes of Artes and treatiſes, are no impediment, but that the Generall Naturall Philoſophie, and alſo Diuinitie are conteined in the holy Scriptures, forſomuch as Natural Philoſophic is, as it were a parte of Diuinitie, and an handmaidē vnto the ſame. For it is a notable meane to knowe God by: which thing alſo S, Ambroſe confeſſeth with mee. What ſhall I ſaye more? The Heathen Philoſophers them ſelues, when they diſpute of the worlde, and the creation of the partes therof, and when they intreat of the nature of thinges, they ſaye that thei play the Diuines, and enter into diſcourſe of Diuinitie, as Ariſtotle ſpeaketh in his booke de mundo of the worlde: ſo that it is no maruaile that wee haue iudged that the true and Chriſtian Diuinitie is partly buſied alſo in matter of Naturall Philoſophie, and the ſettinge foorth thereof, and that for that cauſe alſo the holie Scripture is in part occupied in ſettinge foorth of theſe things, foraſmuch as this knowledge alſo maketh to the aduauncement of gods glory. For in theſe viſible thinges the power, wiſdome, and eternitie of God is to bee ſeene liuely.
               
               
                  S.
                  What is the other argument of theirs, that are of the contrarie opinion?
               
               
                  M.
                  This forſooth, that thoſe thynges which Moſes hath written are moſt plainely and ſimply ſet downe, and in ſuch kinde of ſtile which is fitted to our capacitie and applied to the weakeneſſe of mans ſence, and not

truely and exactly expreſſed according to the truth of thinges: and finally that Moſes doeth neither throughly, neither ſubtily ſearch out or ſet downe the thinges themſelues, and their natures: wherefore, they conclude, that the true, diſtinct, and perfect knowledge of the naturall part, is other whence to bee drawne, and learned.
               
               
                  S.
                  What anſwere you vnto theſe thinges?

                  Uerily, I confeſſe, yt theſe matters concerning Naturall Philoſophie, are not gloriouſly & in a filed ſtyle ſet foorth by Moſes although hee were the beſte learned man that euer lyued, but rather in a bare and ſimple kinde of writinge, ſtriped out of all ornament, as it were out of apparrell, wherby that which hee writeth may the more eaſily bee vnderſtood. But, as it is to bee graunted that hee ſpake ſimply, ſo can it not bee prooued that hee ſpake or wrote lyingly, falſely, and ignorantly of thoſe thinges. It is one thing therfore, to acknowledg that Moſes ſtile is bare & ſimple, which kinde of vtteraūce is meet for the truth: and another thing to ſay that hee is a falſe man and a lyar: which no man can affirme, but whoſo is of a corrupt conſcience. Wherfore ſimply, but truely: barely, but rightly: commonly, but purely, doth hee deliuer vnto vs thoſe thinges which hee writeth, concerning the worlde, of the principall partes therof, of the cauſes and effectes of thinges, to bee beleeued, holden, and taughte among menne. Uerily, I confeſſe, that Moſes applyed himſelfe to ye capacitie of our ſēſes: Howbeit, I deney yt which they affirme, yt therfore hee did not roue at the trueth of ye matter, or had not regarde vnto it: for it was his purpoſe to ſet downe thoſe things in wr

eaſily, barely, and truely.

                  But ſome are of opinion, that all thoſe things which hee wrote in the firſt chapter of Geneſis, are to bee interpreted allegorically. So neither do they think that thoſe ſix dayes are the ſpace of time, neither that the woman in deede was made of Adams ribbe, neither that all the reſidue are ſo to bee taken as Moſes words doe pretende, and ſownde. Which opinion if it be true, what ſhall bee ſure or certeine in all that whole chapter, and ſuch like writinges of other Prophetes, as apperteining to the knowledge of Naturall Philoſophie, or that maye teache vs the ſame?
               
               
                  M.
                  You ſaye well. Indeede ſome haue benne of that opinion, which notwithſtanding S. Auguſtine confuteth in his 1. booke in the Proheme, & alſo in the 8. booke and 2. chapter de Geneſiad Literam, of Geneſis vpon the letter. S. Peter likewyſe in the 3. chapter, and 5. verſe of hys ſeconde Epiſtle: and in the epiſtle to the Hebrues the 11. chapter, and 3. verſe, doth openly impungne this errour of the Allegoriſts, affirminge that thoſe things which Moſes hath reported concerning the creation of the worlde are ſpoken naturally, and plainly: and not allegorically, or figuratiuely.
               
               
                  S.
                  And what at the length, doe you conclude of all theſe thinges, which you haue recited?
               
               
                  M.
                  That forſooth, which S. Auguſtine concludeth in hys 5. booke, and 8. chapter of Geneſis. That thoſe things which Moſes wrot, are true, although they can be eſtabliſhed by no other reaſons. For if a man will diſpute to proue that theſe thinges are falſe, or hee himſelfe can ſay no certentie concerning the eſtate and gouerment of creatures: or if hee ſaye not true, will hee ſuppoſe theſe thinges to bee falſe in that hee himſelfe
                     
                     vnderſtandeth them not? Who will beleeue that Ariſtotle or Plato, did knowe any thinge concerninge the creation of the worlde and the cauſes of thinges, whereof Moſes was ignorant? who firſt receiued the thinges which he wrote, by moſt ſecret reuelation from God. Secondly, who was wel learned in all liberall artes ſpecially in the knowledge of Naturall Philoſophie, and Phiſick (which two artes were at that tyme ſpecially had in price amonge the Aegyptians) as it appeareth in ye Scripture, Actes the 7. chap. and 22. verſe. And to conclude, foraſmuch as thoſe yt were ye chiefeſt Philoſophers amonge the Grecians, traueyled into Aegypt to the intent to learne Naturall Philoſophie, as hiſtories doe rport of Plato and Pithageras. And moſt certeine it is, (as Diogenes Laertius writeth, in hys firſt booke de vitis Philoſophorum, of the lyues of the Philoſophers) that all that parte of Philoſophie whiche intreateth of the nature of thinges, was deriued to the Grecians frō ſtrange nations, and from the Syrians, that is to ſaie, from the Jewes. Shal we ſay thē, againſt ye aſſured faith of ye ſcripture that any one of the cheifeſt Philoſophers, to wit, Plato or Ariſtotle, whiche were heathen men, were called by GOD to counſell when hee went to framinge and creatinge of the worlde, that they ſhoulde knowe more than Moſes the ſeruaunt of GOD, whom God himſelfe taught, and ſhewed vnto him ſuch things as hee ſhould commit to writinge to the behoofe of Poſteritie, and eſpecially for the inſtruction of his moſte deerely beeloued Church? Surely this cannot bee thaught, muchleſſe ſpoken, without notorious blaſphemie againſt God himſelfe. But rather as S. Auguſtine teacheth in his 5. booke and third Chapter de Geneſiad Literam, of Geneſis

vpō the letter: that in that Moſes ſpeaketh ſo plainly, hee doth it by the aſſured counſell and iudgemente of the holy Ghoſt: to the intent that, by the hight of the thynges hee maye terrifie the proude, by the deapth hee may hold them attentiue, by the trueth hee may feede the great ones, and by hys affabilitie hee maye nouriſhe the little ones.

                  The Chriſtian Naturall Philoſophers, whiche intreate of the thinges that are created, dooe referre the ſumme of their diſputatiō to this ende, that our greate and good God, who is the auctour, Father, and creatour of them all, maie bee knowne, praiſed, and extolled: and finally woorſhipped the more ardently, and more feared. But Ariſtotle and the Heathen Naturall Philoſophers, doe ſo diſpute of the nature of thinges, that thei maie wholy ſticke vnto theſe thinges themſelues, as it were, vnto certein lowe and meane degrees,

and an vncertein force, whiche is reſpected after their Creation, and whiche thei terme Nature: thei dooe not ariſe higher, neither doe thei aſcende by meanes of theſe, as it were by a Ladder, vnto GOD the Creatour of them. Wherefore, through greate blindeneſſe of minde, thei doe place ſeconde and onely inſtrumentall cauſes, in ſteede of true and firſt cauſes. And as touchyng the principall cauſes, whiche are God, and his Commaundementes and preceptes, thei altogither let them paſſe. Wherefore thei make the cauſe of the thyng, of that whiche thei call the thyng it ſelf: whereby it cummeth to paſſe, that this moſte excellent knowledge, among them is full of vaine oſtentation of the minde, of ſtrife, and of contention: as for the glorie of God, it neither ſetteth it forth, neither once toucheth it, ſo that verie many of thoſe Natural Philoſophers, dooe at the length beecome indeede, verie naturalles, that is too ſaie, fleſhely men, and Athieſtes, not knowyng, or regardyng God.

                  But the Italian Philoſophers, whiche haue handled matters of naturall Philoſophie, were called alſo Diuines, ſuche as were all the Pithagorians for the moſte parte, who made mention of God the creatour. Anaxagoras beegan his diſputation concernyng the nature of thynges, from a mynde that diſpoſeth all thynges. That golden Booke de Mundo of the worlde, whiche whether it bee Ariſtotles, whiche I dooe not thinke: or Nicholaus the Philoſophers who liued beefore Plutarche: or Alexander Aphrodiſienſis of later tyme: or whoſoeuer others it was, ſurely hee ioyned a treatice concerning God, togither with his diſcourſe of naturall thinges.
               
               
                  M.
                  You ſafe very well. For this was an aunciēt cuſtome

among the firſte Philoſophers, whiche wrote alſo of Naturall Philoſophie in the Greeke tongue, as hauyng learned the ſame of the Aegyptians, or rather of the Syrians, as Laertius ſaieth, that is to ſaie, the Hebrewes, or of their Scholars: but the Philoſophers whiche afterwarde enſued, how muche thei deſpiſed, and laughed at this kinde and maner of handelyng matters apperteinyng to Naturall Philoſophie, and how farre thei haue expelled it out of the Schooles of Naturall Philoſophers, you are not ignorant. Ariſtotles crue at this preſent beareth the greateſt ſwaie, and thei that would haue themſelues moſte truely too bee termed by the name of naturall Philoſophers, neither doe thei themſelues in their diſputations of Naturall Philoſophie, intreate of GOD the Creatour, neither thinke that hee ought too bee intreated of. So that now, the Naturall Philoſophie of the Stoike Philoſophers hath gotten the vpper hande in the Schooles: and the Italians is reiected: whiche Stoike Philoſophers, haue aſcribed the chief and principall cauſes of engendryng of all thinges, vnto Nature, whiche is to bee founde in euery thing, and too thinges created, as vnto Heauen, the Sunne, and the Elementes.
               
               
                  S.
                  What other difference is there beetween Chriſtiā naturall Philoſophers, and Ariſtotelians?
                  
               
               
                  M.
                  In declaryng the cauſes themſelues, whoſe knoweledge and handlyng dooeth muche beelong vnto Naturall Philoſophie.
               
               
                  S.
                  By what meanes?
               
               
                  M.
                  Firſte, the Chriſtian Philoſophers doe both alledge ſuche cauſes as are true, and alſo far other than thei do. For, who will doubt, but that thei alledge ſuche as

bee true, ſince thei receiue them and learne them out of the fountaine of Truthe, that is to ſaie, the woorde of God? And that thei make farre other cauſes, the diſputations and diſcourſes of them bothe doe ſufficiently declare. For wee profeſſe, teache, and acknowledge that God himſelfe is the firſt, and efficient cauſe of al thinges: moreouer, wee haue a ſpeciall reſpecte vnto his voyce and commaundement as a moſte mightie cauſe, whereby a certaine peculiare force is giuen vnto euery thinge which is the cheifeſt and moſte principall cauſe of all other, that wee can poſſibly thinke of or imagine in our minde. Thirdely, wee make for one cauſe, that force and vertue whiche GOD hath alotted and ingraffed in all things: howbeit the ſame to bee onely a ſeconde and an inſtrumental cauſe, and not woorking of it ſelfe, as Eſay teacheth in ye 44. chapter, the 3. and 4. verſe: not principally but depending wholy vpon another, to wit y• power & cōmaundemēt of GOD, without which God woorketh the ſame effectes, when him pleaſeth, which hee is wont to do by meanes thereof. So, when a Hen ſitteth vppon egges out of which afterwarde chicken are hatched, what is ſhe other than Gods bare inſtrument, foraſmuch as ſhee frameth neither the harte, nor heade, nor feete of hir chick within the ſhell, wherein it is conteined, but onely keepeth it, and warmeth it? So, when a woman is with childe, doeth ſhee faſhion hir babe with hir owne handes, whiche afterwarde ſhee bringeth foorth into the world? No ſurely: but is onely, as it were, the receiuer, nouriſher, and keeper of the ſeede which the man caſteth foorth into hir. For God, and the power and ſownd of theſe woordes, Increaſe
                     
                     yee, and multiplye, and fill the earth which as yet are in perpetuall force, doe frame the infant within the woman, facion it, and bringe it foorth. The Philoſophers doe not acknowledge this cauſe. For they holde opinion, that this force and vertue which was giuen vnto things after yt they were created, is the firſt cauſe of all things. So that they place ye effected cauſe in ſteed of the efficient, and the inſtrumentall, for the agent: which is a verie foule errour in a Naturall Philoſopher. Againe, in that they do not ſubmit the capacitie of mans wit, which in deede is very ſimple, vnto the vnſearcheable wiſdome of GOD, but rather make God ſubiect to them and to their capacitie, they deuiſe and dreame of the cauſes of all thinges and their originall, accordinge to the imagination of their owne braine, likeninge GOD hymſelfe the incomprehenſible woorkeman, vnto ſome Smith or Carpenter: & alſo that the matter wherof hee made all things was before prepared and made readie vnto his hand, from euerlaſting: and at the length, that the forme ioyneth it ſelfe vnto this matter, (for according to their iudgement, this matter is rude and without forme) and ſo they conclude, that this matter and forme is the firſt principle of naturall things, which compariſon of moſt vnlike thinges togither, S. Auguſtine woorthily laugheth at, and reiceteth, which as it thinketh nothinge honourably of God, ſo doeth it alſo repugne playnely againſt the trueth of the matter, and the ereation of this worlde.

                  M.
                  That conſiſteth in the meane, maner, and order of

                  M.
                  The Chriſtian and godly men, ſuch as were the Prophetes of God, although they diuerſly recite theſe viſible thinges, according to the argument of the matter which they handle, proceeding ſomtime from the higheſt to the loweſt, & at another time from the loweſt to ye higheſt, as it appeareth in ye 
                     Pſal. 104. & 136. & in the Prouerbes, the 8. chapter, verſe 23. 24. and in ye next folowinge: the 4. of Eſdras, the 6. chapter, verſe 38. and the next folowinge: in the ſonge of the three children, verſe 53. and the next folowinge: yet doe they euermore acknowledge, that that is the true order and meane of the creation of all thinges, which Moſes hath diſcribed. But the Philoſophers, imagininge of the beeginninge of this worlde accordinge to their owne inuentions, can by no meanes agree amonge themſelues, whence to begin their diſputation, concerninge naturall thinges. Some of them therefore, beegin it from a certaine firſt matter, which they bringe in amongſt vs: others from the foure Elements onely: otherſome from a confuſion, and the diſtinction therof: certaine, from Heauen: and ſome from a bottomleſſe deapth alwayes boylinge foorth: to bee ſhorte, looke howe many heades ſo manie meanings, and in this point alſo euery ſeuerall ſect of Philoſophers defendeth ſomethinge, wherein they diſſente not onely from other, but alſo manye times frō ſundry of their owne profeſſion.

                  M.
                  Uerily, there is not one onely meane of defininge, and determininge of all the partes therof. For thoſe thinges which in this art and knowledge wee learne out of Gods woorde, are moſt ſure & moſt true, as grounded vpon a moſt certaine foundation, whiche, whoſo will gainſay, wee muſt deale no farther with him, but giue him quite ouer. But whatſoeuer other things are recited touching Naturall Philoſophie, they are not ſo ſure and firme, bycauſe they bee onely eſtabliſhed by mans ſence, and reaſon: which two thinges, are no vndoubted, and aſſured groundes. For mans reaſon is many times: and his ſenſes are moſt times deceiued. Wherefore, they doe thincke well, who will haue the foundation of that knowledge of Naturall Philoſophie which is not learned out of Gods word, chiefly to reſte vpon theſe two grounds, to wit, mans coniecture, and hiſtoricall experience: in whiche two poyntes alſo, as S. Auguſtine writeth in the 9. chapter of his Enchiridion, Naturall Philoſophers doe ſuppoſe more, than they knowe.
                     
                  
               
               
                  S.
                  That parte therfore of Naturall Philoſophie, which is taught without warrant of Gods woorde, is it vaine and altogither vncertaine: and is it, as ſome ſuppoſe to bee contemned?
               
               
                  
                  M.
                  No, not ſo.
               
               
                  S.
                  Why?
               
               
                  M.
                  Bicauſe GOD hath not giuen thoſe two partes of iudgement vnto men in vaine: to wit, reaſon of the minde, and ſenſe of the body, as wee bee taught in the 12. Chapter of Iob, the 12 verſe, and 34. chapter, and 3. verſe: the iudgement of both which, althoughe it bee not moſt certaine in al things, and ſuffeciently ſubtile and expacte: yet is it not lyinge, and deceiued in althinges. So that all handlinge of matters, which is eſtabliſhed and confirmed vppon thoſe twaine, ought not to bee condemned as altogither vaine and falſe. For who will ſaye that the knowledge of ſo manye notable things and artes is worthily to bee diſpiſed, which GOD, beſydes the Scripture of his woorde, hath giuen vnto men, yea vnto Ethnickes? ſuche as Plato, Ariſtotle, Galene, and many other Philoſophers, both auncient, and of later tymes, haue founde out, and taught. Whoſo deſpiſeth theſe, deſpiſeth the gifts of GOD, Wherwith ſomtime godly men alſo haue bene indued and bleſſed by God, vnto the notable teſtimonie of Gods goodneſſe towardes vs, and miracle of mans nature ſuch as was Moſes himſelfe, and Iob, and thoſe foure whiche talked with him, Solomon the kinge, Ethan the Ezraelite, Heman, Calcol, Dorda, Ionathan vncle to Dauid, all whom the Scripture commendeth and namely maketh mention of thē, to the intent wee ſhoulde imitate them.

                     I Haue hearde enough concerninge the certentie of this ſcience: declare nowe what endes, and meaſure wee ought to reſpecte in that knowledge.
               
               
                  M.
                  Theſe two ought to bee the endes. The firſt is, that accordinge to S. Paules aduertiſement, whatſoeuer ſhall bee diſputed of in this kinde of ſcience, all maye bee referred to the onely glory, and knowledge of our great and good God. For that is the chiefeſt and trueſt ende of humaine Philoſophie, that through it, wee may attaine to the vnderſtandinge of the trueth, and the nature of GOD, like as alſo Plutarch writeth. The ſeconde is, that wee folow not, and affirme vncerteine thinges in the ſteede of certeine. For ſince to erre and bee deceiued is alwayes ſhamefull, then it is moſt ſhamefull to erre in thoſe thinges which oftentimes are of great importāce, and in which a man maye honeſtly and ſittingly enough for him, confeſſe that hee is ignorant. Wherfore, in my iudgement, S Auguſtine ſaid very well in his bookes de Geneſiad Literam, vpon Geneſis accordinge to the letter, There bee manye things, ſaith he, of this vniuerſall creature which wee know not, either bicauſe they bee higher in heauen than our vnderſtanding is able to attaine vnto them, or perhaps are in vnhabitable regions of the earth: or lie hidden very low in the bottom of the deapthes. And this raſſhnes in pronouncinge certainely of vncertaine things, hath miniſtred occaſion that Naturall Philoſophers haue beene mocked by many, frō
                     
which wee ought to abſteine as frō a moſte ſtronge poiſon of humaine ambition. Wherfore, in this Arte, eſpecially curioſitie is to be auoided, & ſobriety embraced. Let vs acknowledge our ſelues to bee farre inferior to GOD, and that wee are not able to finde out the reaſon and cauſe of all thinges that hee hath made, as ſaith S. Irenaeus in his 2. booke, 43. and 45. Chapters.
               
            
            
               
                  The vii. Chapter. The ſubiect of the knowledge of Naturall Philoſophie, is a creature viſible and that can bee ſeene: and firſt how farre and in what reſpect the worlde is a certaine vniuerſalitie vnto them all.
               
                  S.
                  
                     I Haue alredy learned what natural Philoſophie is, and how manifolde, from whence alſo it is to bee learned, likewiſe what is the truthe and certentie of this knowledge, and what bee the endes therof: I praie you wade now more deepely into the matter, and declare vnto mee what is the obiecte of this ſcience, about whiche it is buſied.
               
               
                  M.
                  I wyll doe ſo, and that willingly.
               
               
                  S.
                  Then tell mee, what is the matter of this arte and knowledge?
               
               
                  M.
                  A creature, and not euery one, but that onely whiche maye bee ſeene, that is to ſaye, the ſame which maye bee perceiued by ſome one, or by all our bodily ſenſes.
               
               
                  S.
                  Howe prooue you this?
               
               
                  M.
                  Eſpecially by two places of holy Scripture, whereof the firſt is in ye 1. chapter to the Romanes, and 20. verſe,

where Naturall thinges are called viſible creatures, and are diſtinguiſhed from thoſe things which in the ſame place are tearmed, vnuiſible. The other place is in the Epiſtle to the Hebrewes, the 11. chapter, and 3. verſe, where the ſame thinges are called, ſuch as may bee ſeene. Althoughe that whiche is written in the booke of wiſedome the 7. chapter, the 17. 18. and 19. verſes, and the 13 chapter, and 2. verſe, may expound and confirme the ſame, if it bee ioyned to the places aboue recited.
               
               
                  S.
                  Declare theſe thyngs more at large.
               
               
                  M.
                  This therefore it is, whiche I ſaie. Not euery thyng whiche ſubſiſteth, and whiche the Greekes dooe call, his ſumthing, doeth apperteine to the handlynge of naturall Philoſophie. For God ſubſiſteth, who hath not onely ſome beeing, but the ſame alſo moſte true and an abſolut ſubſtance: and farther, I would adde alſo, if I maie bee ſo bolde ſo to ſpeake, a nature alſo, (for what ſhall let mee to ſaie with S. Peter in his 2. Epiſtle, the 1 chapit. and 4. verſe. The diuine nature, or, The nature of God?) the declaration and diſcourſe cōcernyng whiche, is to bee ſought by an other Arte, and whiche is of more price and dignitie than this is. For God is the Creator and maker of thynges, & not a creature and made. And the force and nature of creatures, is onely conſidered of in this ſcience and knowledge.
               
               
                  S.
                  Yea, but is the knowledge of euery creature conſidered of herein?
               
               
                  M.
                  No, not ſo. For Angelles are a kinde of creatures, but they belōg not vnto natural Philoſophers, although, it bee cōmonly ſaied by all men that thei haue nature, and this kinde of phraſe alſo is vſually found among

the Fathers, to wit, The nature of Angels. Of which nature therfore Moſes entreated not in al that whole fyrſt chapter of Geneſis, although in the ſame hee haue moſt breifly comprehended the whole matter of Naturall Philoſophie.
               
               
                  S.
                  But in the ſame firſt chapter he hath intreated of darneſſe, which thinge ſurely can not bee ſeene, and yet it belongeth to this ſcience.
               
               
                  M.
                  You iudge well for indeede it belongeth to the ſetting foorth of the nature of things, but by accident, as they call it, for neither the meanes of gatheringe togither the lighte, neither of other the firſte thinges coulde bee plainely declared, vnleſſe they were ſette foorth by their contraries, or priuations. For darkeneſſe, as it is a meere priuation, doth not properly of it ſelfe beelonge to this art: but ſo farre foorth as it poſſeſſeth an vſe and place in the nature of thinges, and hath declared the power of GOD to bee the greater in the creation of this worlde, it is very well mencioned of by Moſes. Of all which matter, wee will ſpeake more hereafter.
               
               
                  S.
                  Gather therefore nowe togither ſuch thinges as you woulde, and what you haue proued.
               
               
                  M.
                  Since then, neyther God, neither the Angels, doe appertaine to the Naturall Philoſophers, and to this our preſent diſputation: it remaineth, that the matter of this knowledge and ſcience bee ſaide properly to be that creature which may bee ſeene, and hath a place as S. Auguſtine ſpeaketh, and hath a body, and is ſubiecte vnto our ſenſes, all, or ſome of them.
               
               
                  S.
                  But the Philoſophers, almoſt all of them, are of another opinion: For they thinke that ye ſubiect & matter

of this Art, is that thing which is mouable in that reſpecte that it is Moueable, not in reſpecte that it is created, or ſubiect vnto our ſight.
               
               
                  M.
                  It is true. But therein they erre doubly. The fyrſte errour is, that foraſmuch as the ſignification of Motion is verie large, accordinge to their owne opinion, that it may alſo bee extended to the Angels, ſince manye times alſo they moue from place to place at Gods commaundement, and indeede are fallen from theire fyrſt originall, (hauinge ſuffered no ſmall chaunge not onely of their place, but alſo of theyr nature:) ſurely the diſputation concerninge them were a parte & that proper of the ſcience of Naturall Philoſophie, which notwithſtandinge they doe very ſtoutly, and that alſo verily & in deed dency. And this is theyr firſt erroure. The ſecond is that the knowledge of Naturall Philoſophie doth not beelonge vnto the thynges which wee ſee, if ſo bee any of them bee vnmouable, as thinges that neither periſhe nor are changed. Which, ſince it hath hapned vnto man for ſinne after his creatiō & perfect nature: truely, according to their opiniō neither ſhould mā before hee had ſinned, for the moſt part of him haue ben a ſubiect of natural Philoſophie, neither ſhoulde the treatie of him haue appertayned to Naturall Philoſophie. Which thing, howe vntrue it is, it appeareth out of the ſayinge of S. Paule: who will haue althings that may bee ſeene with our eies, to belong to this our knowledge, & to the ſcience of Naturall Philoſophie, and to bee a ready and apte meane and degree, to the knowledge of GOD. It appeareth alſo by the ſame place, that the nature of man, while hee was pure and had not yet ſinned, is by

                     Moſes reckoned amonge Naturall thinges. It appeareth moreouer, out of ſundrie Pſalmes, that Man and the nature of man, as it was firſt created by God is moſt truely numbred among the kindes of Naturall thinges: as in the 8. and 104. and 139. Pſalmes. the 13. 15. and 16. verſes: and alſo in the 148. Pſalme. To conclude, they that make The mouable bodye to bee the ſubiect of this ſcience, what other thinge go they about, but to teache that there bee two ſubiectes of one Art, to wit, the bodie, and his motion? when as indeede one arte ought to haue but one ſubiect.
               
               
                  S.
                  Why then doe Naturall Philoſophers define and determine thoſe thinges which they call Naturall by Motion eſpecially?
               
               
                  M.
                  Firſt, bicauſe al their knowledge is gathered, as they tearme it, from that which is latter, not from that which is fyrſt. For things then began to bee knowne when they were once extant, and by meanes of mans tranſgreſſion were made mortall, that is to ſaie, were by GOD appointed vnto miſerie and deſtruction. For when they were deſtitute of Gods woorde and light, they perceiued not nor ſaw, what manner ones they were firſt created. Wherefore, when they began to bee buſied in theſe naturall things which are now corrupted, they perceiued their great and perpetuall chaunges, ebbinge and flowinge, and inconſtancie in abidinge in one eſtate, and they iudged that Natural things ſhould bee ſuppoſed of accordinge to that their owne condition. Moreouer, ſeeing that Motion and chaunge may moſt eaſilie and generally bee noted in all theſe things which wee ſee, and which are in this worlde: it was an eaſie matter to diſtinguiſh and determine

Naturall thinges by their motion. There is motion truely in all naturall thinges, and alſo in other which are not Naturall, as in Angels: where by it cummeth to paſſe, that Natural thinges cannot properly bee ſeparated and diſcerned from things not Naturall by Motion.
               
               
                  S.
                  Why do you call a thing, Natural, bicauſe of it owne nature it maye bee ſeene and perceiued?
               
               
                  M.
                  Bicauſe, foraſmuch as God hath created two chiefe kindes of thinges to his owne glorie, as S. Auguſtine teacheth verie often, the one is viſible thinges, the other is inuiſible, which is to bee ſeene in the 1. chapter of Geneſis, Moſes in his treatice of Naturall Philoſophie, hath cōprehended and handled but one kinde, to wit, of viſible thinges onely, and thoſe things onely doth the Scripture acknowledge for the Natural thinges. Wherefore Naturall thinges are to bee defined, as wee haue ſaide, in that they bee viſible. As for inuiſible thinges, and ſuch as cannot bee ſeene, whether they moue or moue not, they are reuoked & reduced to another kinde of Art as thinges that are not Naturall. And to confirme this my ſayinge, I coulde alleage the aucthorities almoſt infinite of the auncient Fathers, S. Baſile. S. Chriſoſtome S. Ambroſe. S. Auguſtine, but what ſhoulde that neede in ſo euident a matter?
               
               
                  S.
                  I vnderſtande theſe thinges: and as I perceiue, this is your iudgement and opinion, that all thoſe things are properly the matter and ſubiect of the Art of Naturall Philoſophie, whiche are the creatures of GOD, and ſubiect to our ſenſes, and maye bee beeholden, or ſeene.
               
               
                  
                  M.
                  You ſaye true.
               
               
                  S.
                  Nowe therefore, define euerie one of theſe, to the end that this whole diſputatiō may proceed in order and methode.
               
               
                  M.
                  I will doe ſo.
               
               
                  S.
                  What is a creature?
               
               
                  M.
                  It is euerie thinge which is neither of it ſelfe, neither hath bene euer, but was once made, yea and that by GOD. Thus doe the learned ſaye, and that truely in my iudgement.
               
               
                  S.
                  But S. Paule to the Romaines, the 8. Chapter, and 20. verſe, ſeemeth to haue taught otherwiſe, to wite, that a creature is that thinge which is ſubiect to vanitie, corruption, and ſeruitude by reaſon of ſinne: which deffinition alſo S. Hillarius followeth in his booke of the Trinitie.
               
               
                  M.
                  You remember it well. Howbeit S. Paule doeth not in that place define what a creature is generally, and of it ſelfe, but what it is now after ſinne, and ſo farre foorth as was thē neceſſarie for the argument which hee had in hande. Wherfore, hee had reſpect then vnto one kinde of creatures onely: Neither doth Sainct Paule define a creature by it owne true nature, but only by the qualitie and accident which indeede is in it, and which hapned vnto things after they were created, that is to ſay, after they were once made creaturs, but as hauinge nowe loſt their full and perfect nature in parte, by reaſon of mans tranſgreſſion. Which alſo may bee anſwered vnto him, whoſo ſhall obiect againſt vs the ſayinge of S. Auguſtine in his booke againſt Felicianus, the 7. chap. A creature is the ſubſtāce of euery corruptible thinge, made by the will of God, out of that which is not yet, or was not ſumtime, ſo far as the nature of the thing wil permit.
                  
               
               
                  
                  S.
                  You thinke then, that it maye otherwiſe bee defined more commodiouſly and more truely, generally what a creature is.
               
               
                  M.
                  Yea verily: For neither ſhould the bleſſed Angels bee truely called creatures, neither wee our ſelues, (if ſo bee that Adam had continued in his firſt ſtate of integritie) haue bene truely tearmed creatures, if the latter definitions were reteined: for wee ſhoulde haue beene incorruptible, and without all vanitie. Finally, the fleſhe of our Lorde Jeſus Chriſte ſhoulde not rightly be called a creature, as it is oftentimes called by S. Auguſtine, and the trueth it ſelfe beareth record, that it was a creature. For of it owne ſelfe it might haue beene voide of all infirmitie, bycauſe it was free from ſinne and corruption, neither was it ſubiecte to death for it owne ſinne: although notwithſtandinge wee confeſſe, that Chriſt died in the fleaſh. Wherfore, whoſoeuer ſtubburnly impugneth y• whiche wee ſay, ſhall fall into all maner of abſurdities. So that thys which wee haue alreadie alleaged, and which wee folowe in this place, is the moſt true and ample definition of this woorde, creature.
               
               
                  S.
                  Nowe then by your definition, is that to bee called a creature, I meane the eſſence of the thinges themſelues, and alſo their vertues and properties, togither with their accidents? as for example, in a man ther is a certayne eſſence, which conſiſteth in the body and ſoule: there is in him alſo a vertue & property whereby hee reaſoneth, woorketh, feeleth, mooueth & walketh. There are moreouer certeine accidentes which are exiſtinge and vnſeperable partes in euery particulare man, whiche doo diſtinguiſh & ſeparate the ſame

man, makinge hym to differ from other particulare perſons of the ſame kinde, whiche in the Schooles are called indiuiduall Conditions. Theſe are alſo neceſſarie and exiſting partes vnto the ſame particulare perſons whereby they liue, as place, time, coloure of the face, ſtature of the body, with other ſuch like: whiche by reaſō of their eſſence, Logicians call accidents. Wherefore I demaund this queſtion of you, whether you cōpriſe vnder the name of a creature, thoſe three kindes of thinges, to wit, the eſſence of the thing, the propertie, and accident, which, as you ſee, are diſtince one from another?
               
               
                  M.
                  Yea truely. For whatſoeuer was by GOD firſt ingraffed within thinges, or by courſe of nature is ioyned vnto them, or whatſoeuer was by him created in this great vniuerſalitie of all thinges, whether it bee a ſubſtāce, or called an accident, I tearme a creature. Although Moſes haue onely or ſpecially handled and entreated of thoſe kindes of thinges whiche are ſubſtances, and ſo in deede are called, which onely I confeſſe principally and of them ſelues to belong to a Naturall Philoſopher. And whatſoeuer hath not proceeded from him, but is made by the art of man, or by him wrought, or by his miſcheiuous or peruerſe will added, that I call not a creature of GOD, no not a creature at all. For there can bee no creature, but that which is made by God, who is the onely creator.
                  Wherefore, the handie woorkes of men, their deuiſes and inuentions, which ſometime are very excellent, ſhall not beelong vnto this arte: no not y• ſinne of man, but by accident, and in reſpect that by meanes thereof ther is a great alteration wrought in the fyrſt & pure

nature of thinges, which at this preſent appeareth in all thinges, but ſpecially in man, who is the moſt beutifull woorke of God.
               
               
                  S.
                  Howe doe the Grecians tearme a creature?
               
               
                  M.
                  They call a creature Ktiſis: although the woorde amonge the Grecians ſignifieth not onely the thinge that is created, but many times alſo the verie woorkinge of the creator, and ſometimes likewiſe the condition of the thinge created as it nowe is, and as wee ſee it.
               
               
                  S.
                  Theſe thinges I vnderſtande. But what meane you by this woorde viſible, when you ſaye a viſible creature was the ſubiect of Naturall Philoſophie?
               
               
                  M.
                  Not that onely which maye bee comprehended by the ſenſe of the eies, as are ſubſtance, light, and coloure, (although this woord viſible ſeeme properly to ſignifie the ſame,) but what ſo euer elſe may bee knowne and perceiued by anye other ſenſe of the bodie, as by feelinge, hearinge, ſmellinge, and taſtinge: as ſmell, ſounde, ſweete, or ſoure, &c. And all bodily thinges are eſpecially tearmed viſible, for that our ſight is ye moſt certaine, moſt excellent, and moſt noble of all the ſenſes of our bodie: and for that alſo the actions of euery lyuinge thinge, and the argumentes whereby we perceiue them to bee aliue, are chiefly gathered by ye ſence of ſeeinge, as moouing, and breathinge. Finally, that bodily thinges are more exactly diſcerned by the eye, than by taſtinge or hearinge: ſo that to ſaye, that a viſible creature is the matter and ſubiect of Naturall Philoſophie, is as much as to meane, that wee wold haue euery creature whiche is ſenſible of it owne nature, to be the true & proper obiect therof: whether the

ſame be bodies, as are the ſubſtaunces of thinges: or whether they bee not bodies, as are the vertues, properties, qualities, motions and actions, which vnto all corporall thinges by nature and their firſt creation and beeginning either cleaue vnto them without, or are engraffed in them within. All theſe kindes are, as I haue ſayd, naturall thinges, and created by God.
               
               
                  S.
                  I Underſtād theſe things. But tell mee now, by how many maner of meanes doeth a Chriſtian Naturall Philoſopher handle and conſider of theſe creatures?
               
               
                  M.
                  Onely twoo waies: the firſt, to wit, as they are all generally conteined in one, and all comprehended as it were, within the compaſſe of one bodie whiche incloſeth them all, which is called the world. Or elſe euerie one in his kinde, which are ſundrie, wherein the creatures are diſtincted, and ſeperated one from another. Whiche the particular Hiſtorie of the creation in the ſix dayes, ſetteth downe vnto vs.
               
               
                  S.
                  How prooue you that?
               
               
                  M.
                  In that the Scripture many tymes reciteth vnto vs all thinges created and viſible, vnder the name of the world: as in Iſay the 38. chapter, and 11. verſe: Iohn the 1. chapter, the 9. verſe; and the 9. chap. the 39. verſe. And many tymes the Scripture reciteth them diſtinctly and ſeuerally, thereby the more to ſet foorth the wounderfull wiſedome of God, as in the 104. and 147. Plalmes, and 8. verſe, and the 149. Pſalme. Wherfore wee muſte alſo entreate of them after both theſe manners, that ſutch thinges as may bee gathered & learned out of theſe creatures apperteinyng to the knowledge of God, and ſetting foorth of his glorie, according as the Scripture teacheth, may bee by vs abundantly

vnderſtoode, ſo that at the length wee may beecome perfect Chriſtian naturall Philoſophers.
               
               
                  S.
                  With whiche of theſe twoo Methodes muſt wee firſt beegin?
               
               
                  M.

                  Bicauſe, that way of teaching is more generall, and more eaſie. For whole thinges are better knowne than their partes: for a man ſhal with more eaſe beehold an whole houſe, than bee able too diſtinguiſhe or comprehend in his minde euerie part thereof. And moreouer, that whiche ſhalbee ſaied concernyng the whole world, wil open vnto vs the way and entrance too the handling of the particular kindes of thinges. For it ſhalbee as a foundation to the reſidue that ſhall enſue.

                  The ſignification of the worlde is diuerſe and manifold, as the Philoſophers doe teache vs, as Laertius in his 7. booke, and Plutarche in his firſt booke of the Philoſophers opinions, whiche ſignification wee muſt firſt diſtinguiſhe, leaſt beeing deceiued by the ambiguitie of the woord, either wee do mocke the reader in this whole diſputation, or elſe deceiue him.

                  Three ſpeciall. Firſt, the world is taken for the creatures themſelues, whereof this whole viſible frame and woorke conſiſteth. So is it taken in Iohn the firſt chapter, the 10. verſe: ſo likewiſe in the 2. Epiſtle of S. Peter, the 3. chap. and 6. verſe. And moreouer, for the corrupt and miſerable condition of this world, which falling vnto all theſe thinges by meanes of mannes tranſgreſſion, now hangeth vppon them: whereby there is a moſt manifeſt confuſion, and a great diſorder in al thinges. So ſayth S. Ihon in the 2. chap. and 16. verſe: and likewiſe the 5. Chapter, and 19. verſe. Finally, it is taken for one parte of the worlde, and that the moſt noble and excellent, to wit, for men only, and manye times for all men, as to the Romanes the 5. chapter, and 12. verſe: Ihon the 3. chapter, the 16. verſe: and oftentimes for the faithfull and regenerat, as in the 1. Epiſtle of S. Ihon the 2. chapter, and 2. verſe. and at another time alſo for the reprobate and vnbeleeuinge, as in the 1. Epiſtle to the Corinthians, the 1. chapter. and 21. verſe: and S. Ihon the 14. chapter, the 17. and 22. verſes. Otherwiſe alſo if a man would call the definition of this woorde worlde, vnto certaine chapters and ſpeciall pointes, wee maye ſaye, that vnder the name of the worlde, ſumtime the place it ſelfe, ſumtime the ſubſtance of the thinges, ſumtime the men as the principall part thereof, and ſumtime the corruption of the ſame part, that is to ſay, of men, is to be vnderſtoode.

                        , of the cumlyneſſe thereof: which reaſon of the name,

truely is repugnant vnto that ſignification, whereby you ſaye that confuſion of thinges and vice is ſumtime ſignified by the name of the worlde.
               
               
                  M.
                  Uerily, you haue alleaged a true definition of thys woorde worlde, from which notwithſtandinge afterwarde the vſe both of the Greeke and Latine tongue hath deflected. For men vnderſtoode that rebellion, corruption, and diſorder was generally in all things and partes of the worlde, they called the ſame by the name of the worlde, bicauſe it is inſeperably diſtributed throughout the whole, a
                        •
                     d ingraffed, as it were, within the marrowe of euery ſingulare thinge. By which meanes, men are many times tearmed to bee the common deſtinie and miſerie of men. The Hebrues in their tongue call the worlde Gola (which woorde the Apoſtles doe tranſlate Euerlaſtinge, as to the Hebrues the 11. chapter, and 3. verſe: the 1. chapter, and 2. verſe, to the Epheſians the 2. chapter, and 2. verſe: not of eternitie, as if the worlde had beene alwayes and from euerlaſtinge, but rather of the fixed and certeine order thereof, which the Lorde God hath eſtabliſhed in it after that he had created the things that are in it, which wee beholde to bee in it & to continue in it euen vnto this daye: as are the riſinge and ſettinge of the Sunne, and the chaunge and alteration of the foure quarters of the yeare. And this ſhall indure ſo longe as this ſtate of thinges ſhall continue, as it appeareth in the 8. chapter of Geneſis, the 22. verſe: the 9. chapter, the 9. or 10. verſe: & Iob the 26. chapter, the 10. verſe: & Eccleſiaſt the 8. chapter, and 11. verſe. Wherfore, whē this age and figure of this worlde is paſt, this order of thinges ſhall periſhe alſo: the 1▪ to the Corinthians
                     
the 7. chapter, and 30. verſe: the 1. Epiſtle of S. Peter the 3 chapter the 4. and 7. verſes, but it ſhall continue vntill that time. For the Hebrues themſelues do plainle ſignifie, that this worlde ſhall one day haue an end, callinge the ſame worlde by the name of Chadel. Pſalme 39. verſe 5.
               
               
                  S.
                  By which definition therefore, or by whiche of thoſe three ſignifications, muſte the worlde bee taken in this diſputation?
               
               
                  M.
                  By the fyrſt.

                  M.
                  The worlde is not onely a certeine comprehenſyon and heapinge togither of all theſe viſible thinges, but alſo a moſt orderly and wiſe diſtinction, ordeined by God in euery kinde and ſpace, whereof hee made heauen and earth to bee the extreame partes.
               
               
                  S.
                  Whence doe you prooue this your definition?
               
               
                  M.
                  Firſt, out of the verie ſame places of the ſcripture, by whiche I prooued that all thinges viſible and whiche can bee ſeene, are the matter of this Arte: and alſo by that ye ſcripture, for the moſt part, vſeth to tearme the moſt excellently and beutifully ordered frame of thys whole worlde, by the name of the worlde as in Geneſis the 24. Chapter, and 22. verſe: the 2. Chapter the 4. verſe: Mathew the 11. Chapter, the 25. verſe: and in other places alſo almoſt infinite.
               
               
                  S.
                  Why haue you comprehended both theſe pointes in your definition, to wit, that the worlde is not onely a general comprehēſion of al things togither, but alſo of them ſeuerally diſtinguiſhed?
               
               
                  M.
                  Bycauſe, if wee wil conceiue in our minde confuſedly all thinges whereof this world conſiſteth, and is diforderly

heaped togither, or lyinge one vpon an other not yet diſpoſed into any order, but as it were ye rubbiſhe of ſome houſe that were fallen downe, or as it were ſtuffe prepared to build ſome houſe withall: ſuch an heape of thinges can not yet bee called a worlde. It is rather that whiche the Grecians, both Poetes & others, tearmed by the name of Chaos: the Hebrues call the ſame Bohu, that is to ſay, a diſordered heape, from whiche ſome thinke the woord Chaos was deriued, by a ſmal chaūge, to wit of the letter B. into C. as though the Grecians, beeing diſdainfull hearers, and vnſkilfull Schollars, had vnderſtoode the woord rather after that maner: Hereof that phraſe and maner of ſpeaking in the Latine toungue is knowne, whiche Verrius the learned Grammarian hath noted, that in the olde tyme the auncient people called the world Cohum, and from thence this woord, in

                        are, to beeginne and leaue vnperfect, was deriued. But by the Apoſtle, in the Epiſtle to the Hebrues, the 3. chapter, and 4. verſe, the worlde is called an houſhold, and compared to a familie well and orderly diſpoſed: neither is it a diſordered heape in deede.

                  Although I know, that ſo proud a name as that is, doth ſcarce pleaſe well ſome very well learned

and godly men: notwithſtanding, foraſmuche as graue auctours, and alſo Eccleſiaſticall Fathers and writers haue vſed that woorde, truely I iudge that it is not to bee reiected. For S. Auguſtine in his Enchirid. the 10. chapt. and in the 8. booke, and 25. chapt. of Geneſis accordyng to the Letter: and Tertullian alſo in ſome place: and Ireneus likewiſe in the 2. booke and 12. is not afeard to vſe this woord for the world: that I may not alſo commende vnto you in this reſpecte S. Ambroſe, and S. Baſill, whoſe opinions perhaps may bee confirmed out of the 3. chap. and 4. verſe of the E. piſtle to the Hebrues. For although, beſides this viſible world, there bee other creatures of God, and thoſe alſo many very excellent & beutifull, as are the Angels, and the ſeates of the Sainctes, and bleſſed men: and this name, vniuerſalitie, ſeemeth to bee an arrogant and bold name: yet all men knowe in what ſenſe they call it ſo, and how wee ought to vnderſtand it, to wit, that the worlde is an vniuerſalitie, not of all Gods creatures, but of thoſe onely that can bee ſeen, and are corporall.

                  Whether this world, and the thinges therein conteined bee ſubſtances, that is to ſay, certaine ſound bodies, and natures truelye and in deede ſubſiſting: or whether thei bee certeine ſhadowes onely, and the repreſentations and images of thinges.

                  M.
                  Bicauſe not onely Plato will haue all thinges that are here, to bee the images of certein ideae or patterns, and the ſhadowes onely of true natures whiche are in heauen, and remaine in Gods minde: but alſo the Valentinian heretikes contend, that whatſoeuer thinges are in this world, are onely the meere imagies of their Eternities, and repreſentations, and tranſitorie ſhadowes of them. In confirmation of whiche their opinion, they alleage the teſtimonie of S. Paule, the 1. Epiſtle, the 7. chap. and 31. verſe, to the Corinthians. The figure of this world
                      (ſaith hee) paſſeth away: as though they were but vaine ſhewes, and no ſound bodies whatſoeuer thinges wee beeholde here with our eyes, what manner thing that was which the Poet deſcribed in theſe woordes:
                  
                     And (but his learned guide inſtruct hym did, to let go by

                     Hee would with them haue fought, and did in vaine to beate beegin.

                  Yea.

                  How I praie you?
               
               
                  M.
                  Firſte, as touching Plato, let vs bid hym farewell, for that hee is not onely an Academike, and doubtfull of minde, and vncertein in euery thing: but alſo an Ethnike, and nothing beelonging vnto vs Chriſtians: for the thinges that are without beelong not vnto vs, as S. Paule ſayeth. But as touching the Valentinians, who would bee called Chriſtians, they are ſufficiently confuted, and moſt ſharply reprooued by S. Ireneus in the 2. booke, and 7. chap. of his woorke whiche hee wroat againſt hereſies. But what abſurdities and inconueniences doe followe that opinion, marke. For they muſte needes confeſſe that thoſe thinges, theſe heauenly ideae and Patterns, whereof, by their Doctrine, theſe earthly thinges are ſhadowes, too bee bodies, which is an abſurd thing. Neither can a bodily thing be an image of thinges yt are meere ſpirituall. Moreouer, all this whole moſt beutifull woorke of GOD, whiche is called the worlde, ſhalbee a fantaſie, and a meere dreame, and not that thing whiche we ſuppoſe it to be: which is blaſphemous. Alſo to ſe, handle, and feele, ſhalbee nothing elſe, but to bee deceiued, and to be mocked, and after the maner of madde and drunken men too bee ſicke and to dreame: and this which wee call ſumthing, ſhalbee nothing. The meates whiche wee eate ſhalbee imaginations: the men with whom wee bee conuerſant, ſhadowes the earth whiche wee goe vpon, a vaniſhing ſhadowe, not a ſound body, and

an element. And finally, Chriſte himſelfe, who was made like vnto vs, was an imaginarie man only, and not a very man in deede, and therfore his paſſion imaginary alſo. And by what meaues might the madnes of the Mar

                  S.
                  What anſwere you to S. Paule?
                  
               
               
                  M.
                  That hee doeth not holde with the Valentinians. Neyther doth S. Paule ſpeake of the thinges themſelues and their nature, what manner it is: but onely of the ſtate and condition of them howe tranſitorie and vncertayne it is, that wee ſhoulde make no accompte of it.

                  Beeſydes the great abſurditie of theſe thinges which wee haue beefore declared, experience it ſelfe confirmeth the trueth: adde here vnto alſo whiche maketh plainly for the confirmatiō of mine opinion, the ſaying of S. Peter, in the 2. Epiſtle of S. Peter, the 3. Chap. the 10. and 12. verſe: and Pſalme 102. the 25. and 26. verſe. And to bee ſhort, all thoſe places of holy Scripture in whiche the Lorde witneſſeth that hee founded the earth, & created all thinges: and not that hee hath caſt beefore our eyes vaine repreſentations, and emptie ſhadowes of thinges, to deceiue vs with all.

                  Some thinke that there bee many, and thoſe of ſundrie kindes. Others alſo, that there are manye, but all of them of one nature.

                  What meane thoſe firſt; which think that the worlds are of ſundrie kindes?
               
               
                  M.
                  They make two ſortes of worldes, whereof the one is intelligible, Ideall, or as a patterne, which indeede ſubſiſteth, but it is reſidēt aboue this world: the other is earthly and figuratiue, which God hath created according to the repreſentation and image of that ſpirituall and ideall worlde, which ſubſiſteth alſo, and it is this worlde which wee mortall men doe inhabite.
               
               
                  S.
                  Doe ſome ſaye thus?
               
               
                  M.
                  Plainely they affirme it. And thoſe not onely prophane▪ Philoſophers, as Plato, Philo Iudeus, and Plu tarch in his booke of the Moones face: but alſo graue men, and ſome among the Chriſtian writers not to bee contemned.
               
               
                  S.
                  Is their opinion true?
               
               
                  M.
                  No veryly. For the Scripture in no place maketh

mention of this ideall worlde, as they call it: and they that are of that opinion, they ſpeake to childiſhly, I will not ſay reprochfully, of GOD, as if hee were an ignorant and an vnſkilfull younge woorkman, that could doe nothing vnleſſe hee hadan example or patterne laid before him, and that hee could deuiſe on nothing, nor thinke vpon any thing in his mind, nor vnderſtand any thing without a fourme layd before his eyes. All which, how well they agree with the omnipotencie of God, and his incomprehenſible wiſedome, let them ſee, for I cannot ſee. Finally, where, and in what place at the length this ſpirituall world is, and how it ſubſiſteth, whether it bee in Gods minde, as one ſubſtaunce in another▪ Surely, it can not ſo bee. For GOD is a moſt ſimple nature, whiche receiueth and conteineth none other thing then it ſelf: but if indeede it were ſo, whether were it as an accident, and a certaine fourmyng, or a phantaſie & fiction of Gods mind? Truely it cannot bee ſo neither. For there ſalleth no ſuch accident vpon God, who in that hee ſeeth the thinges that are preſent, hee gathereth not in his minde the fourmes and repreſentations of thinges that are obiect vnto hym: when hee thinketh and meditateth, hee diſcourſeth not from one thing to another: when hee woorketh and maketh ſomewhat, hee doeth not conſider of it, and examine it according too ſome patterne which hee hath conceiued in his mind▪ to the ende hee would not erre.
               
               
                  S.
                  Howbeit, the Lord cōmaunded Moſes, that hee ſhould doo all thing accordong to the example and patterne which was ſhewed hym in the Mount, as in Exod. the 25. chap. and 40. verſe: and in the Epiſtle to the Hebrues
                     
the 8. chapter and 5. verſe.

                  Firſt, if I liſt, I may make exceptiō, that in that place are handled heauēly things only & not things appertaining to natural Philoſophy. Then again, there is difference betweene God the moſt wiſe creatour, and Moſes a creature & a man, ſubiect vnto the ſame blindneſſe & infirmitie that other men were. Wherefore, to theintent hee might well execute that which hee was commaunded to doe, ſurely hee had neede of ſuche an example, or patterne. This patterne alſo which the Lord ſhewed hym in the Mount, did not indeede ſubſiſt, nor was a ſubſtanciall thing, as I am of opinion: but it was ſutch a repreſentation and image, ſutch as were the images of many thinges to come, whiche were afterwarde by God reuealed to the Prophetes, and beefore that, vnto Abraham and the Patriarkes.

                  They that defend that there bee many worlds of one kinde, what doe they ſay?
               
               
                  M.
                  This for ſooth, that like as wee inhabite this world, ſo others inhabite other worldes, in whiche is alſo an other earth like vnto ours, and other heauens, and another Sunne, and a Moone, and all other things in them as in ours. Wherefore, ſome of them ſuppoſe that there are an infinite number of worldes, ſome moe, ſome fewer. Among whom are rekoned the followers of the Philoſophers Epicurus, and Democritus.

                  M.
                  Fie vpon this infinite or multitude of worlds. Ther is one and no moe: although S. Ierome out of a certeine Epiſtle of Clements diſputeth of the ſame in his Commentaries vpon the Epiſtle of S. Paule to the Epheſians, the 2. chapter, and 2. verſe.
               
               
                  
                  S.
                  Tell mee why you iudge wee ſhould thinke ſo?
               
               
                  M.
                  Firſt, for aſmutch as when the holie Scripture doeth diligently reckon vp the ſpecial viſible works of God, wherein his maieſtie and omnipotencie may eaſilye bee perceiued, hee maketh mention of this one worlde only, and not of any other. Whiche if there had bine many, doubtleſſe hee would haue made mention of them. For that poinct had made verie mutch to the ſettyng foorth of Gods glorie, and power. Moreouer, what is their ſtate, order, condition, fall, conſtancie, Sauiour and Jeſus: what likewiſe is their life euerlaſting, and from whence commeth the ſaluation of this ſecond or third world, it is no where declared, neither in what ſort theſe other worldes were made and created: but al theſe thinges are expreſſed concernyng this one onely. Wherefore, it muſt needes bee, either that thoſe worldes were made by ſome other God, or that they came of themſelues, both whiche opinions are plainly blaſphemous. Or if they bee created by the ſame God by whiche this was whiche wee dwell in, why doeth the Scripture ſpeake nothing of it? Surely there can bee no probable reaſon alleaged of ſo enuious and daungerous ſilence. And therefore it came to paſſe, that the auncient fathers in fore time did verie well thinke and gather that there is but one God, bicauſe there is but one worlde, and cōtrariwiſe that there is but one worlde, bicauſe there is but one God. Moreouer, all this framing of manye and ſundrie worldes, how fooliſh and childiſhe is it? For why ſhould God make many worldes, ſince hee might cō
                     prehend althing more commodiouſlie in one, and the ſame beeyng of ſo greate receite, whiche hee ment to

comprehende in thoſe diuerſe and ſundrye worldes? But, as it is commonly and truely ſayd, God and Nature make nothyng in vaine, and that is vainlye and raſhlye doone by moe things which may bee doone by fewer. For admit that GOD had created moe in number, thoſe worldes ſhoulde differ in number onely, and not in kinde or likeneſſe. What neede hee then to create one maner of thing ſo often? To conclude, whē the ſelfe ſame Scripture oftentymes addeth the Greek article 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , when it ſpeaketh of the world, the auctoritie of S. Iohn in the 1. chap. and 10. verſe witneſſeth, that there are not many, but one onely, and that a certeine one. For the article whiche is ioyned vnto it, doeth ſignifie a certeine and ſure thing. But if wee graunte that there bee manie worldes, euen by the very ſame reaſon wee muſt confeſſe, that they are in number infinite. I let paſſe thoſe abſurdities whiche notwithſtanding doe neceſſarily followe, to wit, that neuer almoſt wee ſhould haue any Eclipſes of the Sunne or Moone. Yea, wee ſhould neuer haue night, ſince one Sunne or another of one of the other worlds, ſhould either riſe vnto vs when ours goeth downe, or elſe ſhould ſhine in the middes of Heauen, when ours is ſhadowed, and in the Eclipſe.
               
               
                  S.
                  But why did not God make manye worldes?
               
               
                  M.
                  Truely, not by reaſon of any impotencie, or lacke of power: ſince that hee is omnipotente. Not that hys ſenſes were exhauſted in the framinge of ſo huge a mole, or his ſtrength weried: for hee made althinge with his woord onely, as it appeareth in the 33. Pſalme. Not alſo that it happened ſo for wante of matter, as the Peripatetikes ſuppoſe, for that all the matter that

was prepared was ſpent in makinge of the bodie of ſo great a frame. For hee that coulde firſte make thys ſo great a worlde of nothing, coulde, if hee had luſted, haue prepared matter for him ſelfe to make infinite other worlds of. But this is onely the cauſe that ther were not many worldes made, bycauſe God woulde not: for hee made whatſoeuer hee woulde, Pſalme 115. and 3. verſe. But why hee would not, it may bee, the cauſe is not knowne to vs, notwithſtandinge it cannot bee an vniuſt cauſe: hee himſelfe ſawe that thys worlde was an argument great ynough vnto vs, to ſet foorth the cōmendation and renoume of his wonderfull mercye and iuſtice, who knoweth all thynge: and therefore hee created this one onely.

                     BUT is this worlde finite, as ſome doe diſpute?
               
               
                  M.
                  It is not onely one, but it is alſo finite, and hath boundes.

                  M.
                  Bycauſe that is finite, whoſe extreame partes may plainely and perfectly bee ſhewed, but the Scripture hath appointed heauen and earth to bee the extreame partes and endes of this worlde, whereof Heauen is the fartheſt, and the earth the neareſt, as it appeareth in the 20 chap. of Exo. & 11. verſe: and Geneſis the 2. chapter and 2. verſe, and alſo in other places. Wherfore, truely it cannot bee doubted, but that it is finite. Moreouer, what difference ſhoulde there bee noted to bee beetweene the Creator and the Creature, if, as

hee is infinite, and without meaſure, the creature alſo ſhoulde bee infinite, diffuſe, and without meaſure. Finally, there ſhoulde bee two infinites appoynted, which by no meanes can bee indeede, or bee defended.

                  M,
                  Firſt, this is wount to bee demaunded, what is the forme of this worlde, and ſpecially of this body, with in the compaſſe whereof all theſe thinges are conteyned: for that ſome will haue it to bee ſphericall or rounde, as Ariſtotle: otherſome of the facion and likeneſſe of the figure Icoſaidron rownde compaſſinge with a greate manye of Angles or Corners heere and there in the top, as Plato: Others, plaine and flat, like a ſkin ſtretched foorth abroode, as S. Baſill: others giue it other formes, and thoſe alſo diuerſe, as the Greeke writer Cleomides reporteth in his title of ye contemplation of circles.
               
               
                  S.
                  Is there any of thoſe opinions true?
               
               
                  M.
                  God he knoweth. Wee, who in no place of his woord doe reade theſe matters plainely determined (vnleſſe parhaps ſome man will alleag that which is written in Iob the 22. Chapter, and 14. verſe: and there is mention alſo made of the ſphere of the earth in Iſay the 40.

chapter and 22. verſe: and in S. Iames the 3. chapter and 6. verſe, to the ende hee might prooue that thys worlde, and alſo the outmoſt heauen, are rounde like a circle or a wheele) doe oftentimes fall & are drawne into contrarie opinions. Uerily, that the worlde is rounde, it ſeemeth vnto mee much the more probable, by that which is written, as I haue ſaide in Iob the the 20. chapter, and 14. verſe: and in Eccleſ. the 24. chapter, and 8. verſe: both for that it is the moſt beutifull and wideſt forme of all other, by whiche it was needefull that a compaſſe which ſhoulde conteyne in the boſome thereof ſo many thinges, ſhoulde bee framed: alſo for that the principall, and as it were the partes of the whole in reſpecte of this worlde as are heauen, water, & earth, are by our ſenſes themſelues perceiued to bee ſphericall and rounde, vnto whiche it is credible that the compaſſe of the whole worlde is ſemblable. Howe bee it, I can affirme nothinge certeinly therof, ſince although wee admit that this part whiche is neereſt vnto vs, & the lowermoſt of the circūference of the high heauen which wee beehold, and which enuironeth althing, be bending, holow, & round notwithſtandinge it maye bee imagined that the farthermoſte and highermoſte parte of the ſame circū
                     ference is of ſome other forme: and I knowe ther bee ſome that haue ſaide that the vttermoſte and farthermoſt part of heauen is ſhaped like a bell.
               
               
                  S.
                  But in the Prophecic of Iſay, it is ſaid, that heauen is ſtretched foorthe, and ſprede abroade like a webbe or a curteine, Iſay the 40. chapter, and 22. verſe: wherevnto alſo accordeth that which is written in the 104. Pſalme, and 2. verſe, wherfore, it is like to a plaine, whiche

fourme is quite contrarie to a circle. For a circle turneth about alwayes in his owne rowmeth.
               
               
                  M▪
                  
                  Uerily, both the places which you haue alleaged, declareth not the forme, but the vttermoſt top or ende of world, which therfore is ſaid by God ſo to be ſtretched abroad and to couer the earth, both that men may the more commodiouſly dwell vnder it, as it were vnder a moſt beutifull and wide rough (whereof it commeth that wee French men call all ſuch couerings, heauen, and in our countrey language, vn ciell) and alſo to the intente that this is a veile beeinge ſprede beefore mens eies, they maye bee reſtrayned from the ouercurious and deepe entring into and ſearchinge after the ſecretes and miſteries of God.
               
               
                  S.
                  But ſince ye ſame holy Scripture hath plainly diſtinguiſhed the higher place frō the lower in this worlde, as in Iſay the 55. chapter, the 9. and 10. verſes, it cannot then ſeeme to bee ſphericall or round. For in a circle no part can bee called high or lowe, foraſmuch as all lines which are drawne from the center to the circumference are equall, and the circumference it ſelfe which way ſoeuer it ſtande, is alwaye vpwarde and in the higher place.
               
               
                  M.
                  Of this wee will ſpeake afterwarde, and that more at large. But nowe to ſet downe ſo much as ſhall bee ſufficient to take all doubt out of your minde, vnderſtande thus much: That by the rules of the mathematicians there bee indeede, and are noted theſe poſitions of the higher and lower place, and that they are indeede diſtinguiſhed one from an other. For the middle of the circle which they call the center, is the lower place and downewarde: and the circumference

(which is the vpper line, which beeinge hollowe, and meetyng togither, conteineth the whole rounde ſpace within the circle) is the higher place, and vpwarde: ſo that in that theſe poſitions and kindes of places and differences are found in the world, you may conclude that which you would, to wit, that the whole receite of this worlde is not ſphericall and rounde.

                     NOW, foraſmuch as this world is but one onely, and ſince it is finite, is it gouerned by ſome one ſpeciallſoule onely, whiche is diſperſed throughout euerie parte thereof, as it were in the members, as wee ſee the ſoule to bee in a mans bodie?
               
               
                  M.
                  That this whole world hath a ſoule, and yt one onely, certain Philoſophers of noble fame haue long ſince bene of opinion▪ as Ariſtotle, & certayne other: whoſe opinion hath hee folowed who wrote in this maner.
                  
                     Firſte heauen and earth, and of the ſeas that flitring feeldes and fines,
                     Theſe glorious ſtarres, this gliſtringe globe of Moone ſo bright that ſhines.
                     One liuely ſoule there is that feedes them all with breath of loue:
                     One minde throughe all theſe members mixt this mightie maſſe doth moue.
                  
                  But this is not ſo much a ſolemne ſentēce or ſaying, as it is a great errour, as S. Auguſtine teacheth in his booke againſt Felicia Aria▪
                      the 12. Chapter.
               
               
                  S.
                  Why ſo?
               
               
                  M.
                  Bicauſe thoſe bodies which are conteined within the

gouenrment of one ſpirite, and one ſoule, are all one, & not diuided (as is the bodie of euery one of vs) & not ſeparate one from an other as a flocke: and not one touching or neere ioyning to an other, as are the fingers of a mans hande, & houſes that ſtande one cloſe to an other. As for the parts of this bodie, which wee call the worlde, they are not onely diſtinguiſhed one frō an other, but ſeparated alſo & diuided frō thēſelues by diſtāce of ſpace. For euery ſheepe, euery horſe, euery tree, euery particulare mā is a part of this world: yet are they ſo deuided by place & mole of body, and by circumſcription of diſtance, that it cannot bee ſaide, that all and euerye one of theſe haue one ſoule onely. For what would come to paſſe, if it were imagined that in deed there were one onely ſoule, and ſpirite in all theſe thinges? For ſooth this abſurditie: That the ſoule, which is a certein ſimple nature and altogither ſpirituall, were to be diuided as bodily things are, and not by imagination onely. Neither can this inconueniēce bee auoyded, ſeeinge that thoſe thinges in which that onely and ſingulare ſoule is conteined are in truth ſeparate and diuided by place, and determined euerye one of them by circumſcription of their owne bodye. Moreouer, it ſhoulde folowe that all the partes of the world had life, as the Sunne, the moone, the ſtarres, the heauē it ſelfe, yea & all ye celeſtial bodies which notwtſtanding S. Auguſtine moſte plainely denieth in hys booke againſt Priſcillia the 8. 9. Chapters: & that thys opinion of S. Auguſtine againſt the Mamches is true, the effect prooueth. For who woulde euer affirme, that the ſtarres had lyfe or reaſon? Finally, ſince of the partes of the worlde, ſome bee mortall, as brute beaſtes:

and certeine immortall, as men: howe can it bee that this ſingulare and one onely ſoule of the whole world, can admit in it ſelfe qualities and conditions ſo contrarie and repugnaunt one to an other, that it ſhoulde bee one parte of it mortall, and another immortall? ſpecially beeing it ſelfe ſingulare, one, and ſimple: not double, and compounded. Moreouer, amonge ſuch thinges as die, ſomeperyſhe verie ſoone, as wormes, and flies: ſome continue verie long, as Ceder trees, the Crowe, and the Heart: by this reckonyng it cummeth to paſſe, that this ſoule of the world, which notwithſtanding in theſe mens opinion is onely one, and in number ſingulare and a lone, may bee called partly dead, and partly a liue. All which how fooliſh, falſe, and repugnant they bee, you ſee.
               
               
                  S.
                  I ſee indeede, and I agree with you, in that you doe moſte truely deny that there is one onely ſoule, and that in number ſingulare, of this whole world.

                  Yea, farther, beeſides the reaſons aboue recited, wee will laſtly alleage this one out of holy Scripture, as the ſtrongeſt of them al. To wit, that by this meanes, the goodnes and wiſedome of God, who giueth vnto euery thing, and ingraffeth within them their proper and diſtincte vertues, is not only obſcured, but vtterly extinguiſhed, and plucked out of mennes mindes: whiles wee attribute theſe vertues, the adminiſtration and gouernment of thoſe thinges, not vnto GOD hymſelfe, but vnto a certaine other nature and ſoule, contrarie to that whiche wee are taught too beeleeue and confeſſe, Pſalme. 147. and 15. and 16. verſes: To the Epheſians the 3. chapter verſe 20. and Iob the viii. chapter the 5. verſe.

                  If then, there bee not one certeine ſoule of this whole vniuerſalitie, as you teache, truely the opinion of the Stoikes, Platonikes, and of certeine other Philoſophers: and likewiſe of the Priſcillianiſt Heretikes is ouerthrowen: who ſay, that this worlde is a liuyng creature: and indued with will and reaſon.
                  
               
               
                  M.
                  You gather wel: For their opinion is altogether fooliſh, and vnreaſonable. For, ſince that is only a liuyng creature, and ſo to bee called, whoſe partes and members are not conteined only in one continuall compas of the bodie, but alſo gouerned by one ſpirite: verely this worlde is not a liuyng creature. For the mēbers thereof are diſioyned, and ſeparate. As for the auctoritie of the Stoikes, and other Philoſophers which you named erewhile, it ſhould mooue vs verie little, had not S. Auguſtine ſometyme written, that hee doubted whether this worlde were a liuyng creature or not: whiche thyng as hee would not deny, ſo durſt hee not affirme: whoſe doubt notwithſtandyng we ought not to followe, or allowe of.

                  Many argumentes doe prooue, that the world once beegan to bee: among whiche all, Philo in his booke De Mundo, of the worlde, hath gathered fiue ſpeciall ones. We wil declare ours

                  M.
                  Theſe foure. Firſt the voyce and auctoritie of the diuine Scripture, whiche ſpeaketh in this maner: In the beeginnyng God made heauen and earth: Geneſis
                      the 1. chapter and 1. verſe. The ſecond reaſon is certeine: For if the world were coeternall with GOD, it ſelfe alſo were God: for eternitie is not only proper to diuine nature, but alſo the moſt it ſelfe ſubſtance therof, and the principall part, and definition: Exodus the 2. chapt. and 14. verſe. Reuelat. the 1. chap. and 8. verſe. The thirde, that foraſmuch as this world ſhall haue an ende, and euery thing hath meanes whereby it doth conſiſt, it followeth neceſſarily that it had a beeginnyng of beeyng. For although, that bee truely ſayde, not whatſoeuer had a beeginnyng ſhall haue an ende (foraſmuche as there bee many thinges made, which through the ſingulare benefite of God, are not ſubiect to death and corruption, as Angels, and the ſoules of men whiche are immortall) notwithſtandyng it is moſte certeinly affirmed, that, whatſoeuer ſhall haue an ende, the ſame alſo had beeginnyng of beeing. Which Rule is ſo generall, that it admitteth no exception. Finally, the fourth is this, that not onely the cauſes of the creation of the worlde are ſet downe, and alſo the certeine tyme noted, but alſo for the preſeruation of the perpetuall memory therof, there are certeine ſpaces of tyme preſcribed, as the order of weekes doe plainly teache: and alſo the ſpace of fiftie yeares, which is called by the Hebrues the yere of Iubile, whiche God hymſelf commaunded to bee obſerue: whereby wee might eaſely knowe and vnderſtande, how many ages are paſt ſince the firſt beeginning

of the world.
               
               
                  S.
                  Concerning that auctority whiche you alleage out of the Scripture, and the 1. chapter of Geneſis ſome doe otherwiſe interprete it. They graunte, that all theſe things indeede were made in the beeginnyng, but not in tyme. For the meaning and ſignification of a beeginnyng, or of this woord principium, is manifolde, and in that place, they ſaye, it muſt not bee vnderſtoode of the beeginning of tyme.
               
               
                  M.
                  The ſignification of a beeginnyng, or of this woord principium, is threefold. For it reſpecteth either the time either the thing & the cauſes, or elſe ye order. The beginnynge of time, in thoſe things which are brought forth in a certein time, is yt moment of an houre either wherein they are conceiued, or are brought foorth into the world. Thoſe thinges haue onely the beeginnyng of tyme, which are doone in tyme. That which is called the beginning of a thing, and is taken for the cauſe in thoſe thinges which are of one age and time, is that relation and affection, whereby one thyng is the cauſe of the beeing of another. So, if wee make a conference beetweene the day and the night, wee ſaye that the Sun is the beeginning of the daye and light, although both of them do appeere vnto vs at one moment. Sutch a beeginning, a diuerſe or certeine time doth not eſtabliſh. Finally, a beeginnyng in reſpect of order, is called that which miniſtreth the beeginnyng of numbryng, in ſutch thinges as are diſpoſed in one order, as for example: The father is the beginning among the three perſons in trinitie, which are one god: y• magiſtrate is one amōg many of like auctoritie, wt whō in telling we do begin: like as we do wt our cheif Magiſtrate or Judge in this our Citie of Geneua.
                  
               
               
                  
                  S.
                  In this reſpect then, they woulde haue God to bee the beginninge of this worlde, as beeinge the cauſe and woorkeman therof, as hee that is firſt numbred, is called the beginninge.
               
               
                  M.
                  Marke howe abſurde this is. Firſte, what ſhall bee the ſence and meaning of this ſaying, In the beeginnyng God made heauen and earth, if ſo be they wil thus expound it, God in the beeginnyng, that is to ſaye, God in God created heauen and earth? Moreouer, why ſaide hee, did create, which woorde doth not onely determine a beginning of beeing, but alſo the force of woorking, and a determinate beeginning of time is therein manifeſtly comprehended and included. Beeſides, will wee, nill wee: by this reaſon we ſhal fall into that damnable hereſie of the Hermogenians, who make the woorke to bee eternall with the woorkeman, and ſo wee muſte needes make moe Gods than one. Of which errour, me thinketh I ſhoulde ſpeake ſumwhat more at large, were it not, that Tertullian, longe ſcience, had vtterly ouerthrowne it in a whole woorke, yea, the Scripture it ſelfe doth manifeſtly expounde this ſayinge of Moſes, of the beeginning of time, Prouerbes, the 8. Chap. and verſes 25. 27. and 28. Hee vſeth alſo the ſame woords and the ſame compariſon, whē hee ſpeaketh of the beginninge of the worlde, wherein there muſte needes bee vnderſtood a beginning and moment of tyme, and of beeing. Neither can that which S. Paule repeateth ſo often, ſpeakinge of the beginning of the world, bee vnderſtoode of the laying of the foundations thereof to the Epheſi. the 1. Chapter, and 4. verſe, and, wheras in an other place he calleth certain tymes ſeculare, the 2. to Timothie, the 2. Chapter and 9. verſe: to Titus the 1.

Chapter, and 2. verſe: vnleſſe that wee confeſſe that all theſe thinges had a certeine time of beginning, and beeing. What are theſe eternall and ſeculare tymes, what ugnifieth this woord 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , is there not vnderſtod therby a laying of the foundacions in time: and doth hee not terme thoſe times ſeculare, whiche paſſed away, and muſt bee numbred from the moment and pricke of time, wherein all theſe thinges began to bee made? In which point Sainet Auguſtine agréeth with vs, in his booke againſte the Priſcillianiſts, the 6. chapter. To bee ſhorte, howe ſhoulde the ages of thoſe auncient men Adam, Enoch, Noah, & alſo the time of the vniuerſall flood, bee knowne how far diſtant it is ſince the beeginninge of the woorlde, if there were no beeginning of time in which the world was made? In ſo much, as I meruaile what ſhoulde mooue certaine Eccleſiaſticall writers, to doubt thereof: and ſpecially S. Auguſtine, a man ſo much exerciſed in the ſcriptures: as namely in his booke of Geneſis vpon the letter: althoughe alſo afterwarde hee bee altogither variable in defending the ſame, and manye times diuerſe and diſſentinge from him ſelfe.
               
               
                  S.
                  But ther bee ſome, that obiect two auctorities which are repugnaunt to your opinion: whereof the firſt is that which is written in the 18. chapter, and 5. verſe of Eccleſi. GOD made althing at once,
                      wherevnto I praye you to anſwere firſt.
               
               
                  M.
                  It ſhall bee an eaſie matter ſo to doe. For if I lyſte, I coulde aunſwere that, which as I ſuppoſe, wee haue already agreed vpon, that the auctoritie of this booke is farre to bee remooued and ſeparated, from the Diuine & canonicall Scriptures. And therefore it prooueth

nothing. Howbeit, I had rather ſay that that is true, which is confirmed by the woordes of the texte, and that the place is corruptly tranſlated in this maner, God made all thinge at once, for the meaninge of the aucthours woordes is this: Hee that liueth for euer, made all thinges togither: hee ſaith, altogither. Wherfore wee are taught, to acknowledge one onely aucthour and creatuor of all thinges, as Ireneus ſayth in the 4. booke and 21. chapter: it is not there affirmed that all thinges that are created had there beeing beeginninge, or were all made in one moment, or yt they were frō euerlaſting, or without beeginning of time. This is therfore the ſignification of this woorde, Pariter, togither, to wit, that the power to create all thinges, is giuen to one, and not to many. For the ſame booke in the 16. Chapter, and 25. verſe, ſetteth downe, howe that created things were diſpoſed and made in certein order, and time, Howbeit, I am not ignorant, howe much the ſignification and readinge of this onely woorde, Pariter togither, did oftentimes trouble S. Auguſtine in the 5. booke, and 3. Chap: and alſo in his 6. booke, and 6. Chapter of Geneſis vpon the letter▪ and alſo many other of the Fathers. Thus haue you mine anſwere to your firſte obiection, to wyt, that for at once, you muſt vnderſtande, togyther. Nowe tell me your other aucthoritie.
               
               
                  S.
                  They alleage alſo, that whiche is written in S. Iohns Goſpell, the 1. chapter, and 1. verſe, In the beginnyng was the woord. Now if you think that this woord, beginnyng, is to bee referred to time, then muſt you moſt impiouſly affirme, that the woord, or the Sun of God, which is ſignified thereby, had his beeginning in ſome time,

and is not eternall.
               
               
                  M.
                  Truely, wee ſhould bee hardly vrged by ſo great auctoritie of the Scripture, vnleſſe the matter it ſelfe, whereof wee intreate, did miniſter vnto vs the diſſoluing, and expoſition of this difficultie. Wee haue alreadie declared, howe that the ſignification of this woord, principium, or beeginnyng, is ſundrie, wherfore, it ought too bee taken accordyng to the reaſon and nature of the thyng whereof wee diſpute. And you ſee, how S. Iohn plainly ſaith, that this woord, or Sunne of GOD, was not created in the beginning, but that it was in the beeginning, when God created all thinges: ſo that S. Iohn ſetteth this his, In the beginnyng was, againſt the ſaying of Moſes, and creation of all things, where the Scripture ſpeaketh thus, In the beginnyng God created heauen: and not thus, in the beginning was heauen. And moreouer, S. Iohn teacheth, that the ſame woord of God, is alſo the ſame God. And that woord, ſayeth hee, was God. But that whiche is God, can haue no beeginning of tyme. Wherfore, the ſame is moſt falſly expounded and vnderſtoode of time and beeginnyng of exiſtencie in Chriſt. And therefore this woord, Beeginnyng, hath another ſignification in that place: too wit, that, by whiche S. Iohn excludeth all beeginnyng of time, to the ende that ſo far as our mindes are able by thinkyng too looke backe, and to ſtretche foorthe themſelues, wee may not withſtanding beeleue moſte aſſuredly, that beefore, that woorde and Sunne of GOD, had beeing, and had a diſtinct ſubſtance from the Father. By whiche meanes of ſpeaking, eternitie is accuſtomably ſignified in the Scriptures, as it appeareth in the 8. of the Prouerbes. And alſo by the ſelfe

ſame teſtimonie of S. Iohn it is declared, how that all theſe thinges were made and brought foorthe in the beeginning of tyme: for they were not in the beeginning as was the woorde, but they were made, for aſmuch as they were not in the beeginning.

                  S.
                  
                     NOw, ſince you haue prooued, that the worlde had a beeginning of beeing, I praye you declare, whether it came of it ſelfe, or of ſome other.
               
               
                  M
                  I ſuppoſe, there is no man, though hee bee but ſlenderly learned in the Scriptures, that doubteth concernyng this poinct, to wit, that the worlde came not of it ſelfe but of another, to wit, of God. For if it came of it ſelfe, it ſhould alſo bee immortall and eternall, and not made in tyme. For it were then of abilitie to miniſter force vnto it ſelfe, to endure perpetually, and it ſhould alſo haue alwayes bene. And beſides this, it ſhould bee a God. For what ſoeuer is of it ſelf, and hath life & ſubſtance muſt needs be god. Foraſmuch as ye Creatour differeth frō ye creature in yt reſpect eſpecially, in yt the Creatour is, and ſubſiſteth by his own power and vertue: and the creatures onely by his power and aſſiſtance. Worthily therfore S. Auguſtine in his Enchiridion, No man, ſaith hee, can bee of hymſelf. The omnipotencie of the Creator, and the vertue of hym that is omnipotent and poſſeſſeth all thyng, is the cauſe of euery creatures ſubſiſting.
                      Whoſoeuer therefore, ſhall deny this, to wit, that this world was made by the wil and power of God, but will contende that it had the force and vertue in it ſelfe of beeing, plainly repugneth againſt

the whole ſacred Scriptures. For there is no thing almoſt better knowne, or more oftner inculcated into our eares, than that God is the maker and creatour of this world, and that all thinges were faſhioned & brought foorth by his hande, will, & power. And that I may not traueill in the gathering togither of theſe teſtimonies, I will here recite vnto you: twayne for all, the one in the Pſalme 104. and 29. verſe, If thou hyde thy face, they are troubled: if thou take away their breath, they die, and returne vnto their duſt: if thou ſend foorth thy ſpirite, they are created, and thou renueſt the face of the earth. the other in Iſay the 45. chap. and 18. verſe: For thus ſayth the Lorde, that created heauen, God hymſelf, that formed the earth, and made it, hee that prepared it, hee created it not in vayne: hee formed it to bee inhabited. And therefore the auncient Fathers commonlie termed the worlde, a woorke perfectlie wrought.

                  M.
                  Yea, I haue. And firſt Moſes proueth, that it was God y• made this world, Geneſis y• 1. chap. In the beginning God
                     
                     made heauen & earth. And Dauid alſo cōfirmeth ſame in y• 33. Pſalme, and 6. verſe: By the woorde of the Lorde were the heauens made, and all the hoſte of them by the breath of his mouth. For hee ſpake, and it was doone: hee commaunded, and it ſtoode. Likewiſe Iſay in the 44. chap. And Iob the 12. chap. And finally both the newe and old Teſtament. The ſame alſo did Anaxagoras the Philoſopher ſignifie ſum what obſcurely, hauing before receiued it by ſome auncient tradition, who called the mynde; that is to ſaye, God, the Creatour of all thinges: who, although hee were therefore laughed at by the other naturall Philoſophers of his tyme, yet he helde the true opinion. Howbeeit, the Marcionites, and after them the Manichees, doe vrge farther. They ſay, that this world wherin there is ſutch diſturbance and diſorder among thinges, is vnworthy to bee called or counted Gods woork. For, what confuſion, what calamitie, what perturbacion is there ſeene in this worlde, and in all theſe thinges, where wicked men doe rule, good men are vexed, the Summer ſometyme is colde, the Harueſt greeuous, and daungerous, and ſutch other like accidentes doe happen? And therfore, if wee ſay that God made theſe things, God is not the auctour of order in the world, but of greate confuſion.
               
               
                  S.
                  But what is your opinion hereof?
               
               
                  M.
                  They iudge amiſſe, for God is the creatour and producyng cauſe of all thoſe thinges, and ſubſtaunces, wherof the world conſiſteth: and not of the confuſion and diſorder whiche now is, and afterward came vppon them: for that is the effect of mans tranſgreſſion, and a great part of that vanitie, wherunto in the beeginnyng through Adam, all thinges were ſubiect: Romanes
                     
the 8. chap. Therefore it is not cauſed by GOD, neither ingraffed by hym, nor proceedyng from hym. For hee created all thinges firſt, good, and in good order, and ſubiect to no diſorder, confuſion, or deformitie. So Romulus builded the Citie of Rome, & not thoſe ſeditions, which many hundred yeres after his death, ſprang vp at Rome through y• ambition of men. Wherfore, againſt the Marcionites and Manichees, we ought to diſtinguiſhe and deuide the thinges themſelues, their nature and ſubſtance, from the deformitie whiche afterward hapned and came vpon them. For the Heathen Philoſophers themſelues, as Thales for example, haue called this worlde: a beutifull woorke, and counted it woorthy of God, agreate deale better than thoſe Heretikes haue doone.

                  It was God therfore, that created and fourmed this worlde: what GOD? Forſooth hee which is one in ſubſtance, and three in perſon, to wit, the Father, the Sunne, and the holy Ghoſt: and ſo is it to bee vnderſtoode that God made the world, to wit, that it is the woorke of them all three indifferently: and not either the Fathers, or the Sunnes, or the holy Ghoſts ſpecially or principally: the woorkes alſo of the whole Trinitie are vndiuided, althoughe the woorkemanſhip of either of the perſons, is diſtinct in the ſelf ſame woorke.

                  M.
                  
                     Meſes teacheth in the 1. of the Geneſis, that the Father wrought in the creation of the worlde, and alſo the woord, that is to ſay, the Sunne, & like wiſe the holy ghoſt. The father createth by his wil: the woord, or y•
                     
Sunne createth by woorkinge and bringing foorth: and the holy Ghoſt treateth by implāting of ſtrength and nature, and by giuing of motion and life, whiche is in euery thinge for the bringinge foorth and preſeruation therof. And therfore S. Ihon in the 1. chap. and 3. and 14. verſes, when hee had declared that all thinges were made by the woorde, hee ſaieth afterwarde, that the ſame was the Sunne of God. Wherfore, the Sunne is, and is alſo rightly called the creatour of the world. And ye holy Ghoſt giueth ſtrength to liue, and to mooue, and alſo ſuſteineth, both that they may exiſt and liue, & alſo continue & bee preſerued. Wherefore hee alſo in the creation of the world, woorthily challengeth vnto himſelfe ſome parte of ſo woorthie a woorke, which alſo by Iſay in the 40. chap. and 7. verſe: and the 41. chapter, 29. verſe, are plainlyaſcribed and attributed vnto him.

                  There bee otherſome, that doe otherwiſe interprete this which you ſaye, and by this name, VVoorde, and alſo ye 
                     holy Ghoſt, do not vnderſtand certain ſubſtances, or any thinge exiſting of themſelues: but ſuppoſe rather that thereby the meane is taught, by which this worlde was made, to wit, not that by anye engin or frame, not by ironwoorkes, not by any handie crafte ſo hugie a mole was framed and brought foorth: but onely by the commaundement and the word of Gods will, that is to ſaye, onely by the declaring and publiſhing of Gods decree, which of it ſelfe is of ſufficient power and efficacie.

                  I doe not deney, but that thoſe thinges which vnto vs of their owne nature are miſticall and incomprehenſible, are opened and declared by ſuche parables: set

and ſet foorth in ſuch wordes & metaphores, as by vs they may bee vnderſtoode. To wit, that the eternall Sunne of God, is called the woorde: and the holie Ghoſt which is that diuine perſon, & ſubſtancial vertue ſubſiſtinge by it ſelfe, and proceeding from the Father and the Sunne, and is diſtinct, notwithſtāding is called a ſpirite. But foraſmuch as the ſcripture in an other place teacheth, that, that woorde is not a certain ſound or declaratiō of Gods will, & a certeine common enuntiane or ſpoken woord, & that the ſpirite is not a power and vertue infuſed into thinges, but that hee is God, and the verie ſame that is called the dweller in our hartes, Iohn the 1. chap. the 3. verſe: and the 1. to the Corinth. the 6. Chapter, the 19. verſe, both which perſōs, ſince it is taught in the ſcriptures in ſundrie places, that they wrought with the Father in the creation of the worlde, howe can it bee doubted but that our opinion is right and true.

                  Out of the 44. Chapter. and 24. verſe of Iſay, I am the Lorde that made althinges, that ſpread out the heauens alone, and ſtretched out the earth by my ſelfe.
                      And Iob, the 41. Chapter, the 2. and 3. verſe: and to bee ſhort, this is the generall doctrine of the ſcriptures. The ſame is alſo confirmed by reaſon. For hee is alone which calleth thoſe things that are not, and brought them foorth into the lyght, and finally hee alone is the aucthor and Father of all thinges.

                  I am not ignorant of that. For I ſhall bee uexed almoſt with innumerable rables of Heretikes, & Heathen Philoſophers: but Gods woord ſhall ſufficiently defende mee, and his holy trueth ſhall ſtande for me againſt them all.

                  M.
                  I will gather them togither out of Ireneus, cheifly out of the 1. and 2. booke. Some of the Heretikes will haue it, that this worlde was firſt thought vpon and conceiued in minde by one God, and procreated and made by another, as certaine of the Valentinians and Carpocratians do affirme. Otherſome, by a certain other nature and farre differinge vertue than which ought to bee called a God, and which gouerneth althing, by whom they ſuppoſe this worlde to haue beene made as Corinthus held opinion: whom at ſumtime they termed Hyſtera, a belly or a wombe: & at another Demiurgus, a pronouncer of lawes: & doe diſtinguiſh him from the ſame whome they will haue to bee the true God, & call Propator. Some again, thinke that the world was made by angels only, and not by God, as the Simonians, and Menandrians: ſo many are the wandrings awry, whē a man hath once departed out of the right way.

                  They holde opinion, that the worlde was made by their deuils, whiche they call Angels, and make them to differ from the greate God in whole kinde, as doe the Platonikes. As for Epicurus, who ſayeth that thys world came by chaunce, I accoumpt hym not among the number of Philoſophers: and as for the opinions

of the other, I haue no leaſure now to rehearſe them.

                  M.
                  The woord of GOD, and the reaſon alſo whiche is confirmed by the ſame Philoſophers. The woord of God, that foraſmuch as it is the proper and peculiare attribute or title beelongyng to GOD onely to bee a creatour, the ſame cannot agree with Angels, or any other thing: My glory will I not giue to another, ſaieth the Lord. &c. Iſay
                      chap. 42. verſe 8. and chap. 45. verſe. 12. Moreouer we ſhould make ſo many ſeuerall Gods, as there bee Angels, creatours. For who ſo createth, the ſame alſo giueth and ſuſteineth life, and his woorke dependeth altogether of hym, and of hym it hath it only beeing. Wherefore, the Angels alſo ſhalbee life giuers, and ſuſteiners, & Goddes, and Iehouah, that is to ſaye, giuers of exiſtence. Whiche thing, how mutch it repugneth againſt Scripture, it may bee vnderſtoode out of the 45. chap. and 18. verſe of Iſay: Whereupon alſo S. Auguſtine in his 3. booke, and 8. chapter of the Trinitie, woorthily and truely denieth with vs, that neither the diuels, nor Magicians are able to create one.

                  Yea, this one, to wit, The nature of beeginnings, loueth ſingularitie. And therfore Ariſtotle reciteth and commendeth the woorthie opinion of Homer:
                  
                  It is not good that many rule, Let one our ruler bee.
                  who vſing likewiſe ye ſame argument in his 12. booke of Metaphyſikes, affirmeth that there is one chief & moſt excellent God among the reſidue, who is King & ſouereigne aboue them al. The ſame opinion hath S.

                     Auguſtine alſo embraced in his firſt booke of marriage, the 9. chapter: and vndoubtedly experience it ſelf teacheth, that it is a moſt true ſaying. Thus can hee alſo make ſmall thinges, that made the greate: and the ſame God that made high thinges, bringeth foorthe and fourmeth the lowe things alſo, for hee is almightie, as Father Ireneus, ſaieth, in his 2. booke, and 44. chap. ſo that it is not onely not neceſſarie that there ſhould bee many creatours of this world appointed, but it is alſo againſt the nature of beginninges, and the omnipotencie of God, that there ſhould bee more than one.

                  M.
                  In reſpect that hee hath not onely giuen power and beutie vnto thinges, but firſt hath brought foorth and made them out of nothinge, hauing no matter preexiſting or going beefore, which is properly called to create.
               
               
                  S.
                  Is there anye notableneſſe or excellencie in the ſignification of that woorde, which may bee reputed peculiare and proper to the power of God?
               
               
                  M.
                  Yea mary. For by that meanes GOD is verie farre ſeparated from all ſortes of other woorkmen, and alſo from all other kindes of cauſes, as are parents, and

ſeruants, or elſe the naturall powers.
               
               
                  S.
                  How ſo?
               
               
                  M.
                  For that no woorkman bee hee neuer ſo mightie and ſkilfull, is able to make anye thyng vnleſſe hee haue ſtuffe miniſtred vnto him: for if he haue no ſtuffe, hee is able to make nothing. Take away yron from the Smith, timber from the Carpendour, yearne from the Weauer, what other good can they doe but ſtand ſtill gaping in their ſhoppes? For euerie Arte and occupation requireth naturally to haue ſome ſtuffe prepared for it, wheruppon afterwarde it woorketh, and bringeth foorth ſundrie fourmes. Yea, not the cauſes themſelues, and powers whiche are termed naturall, and are proper to euery thing, are able to bring foorth any thing without conuenient matter and ſtuffe alotted vnto them. For, if a man ſearche throughly the greateſt and whole vertues of the natures of all thinges, notwithſtandyng hee ſhall finde that to bee true which is generally ſpokē by ye natural Philoſophers. Nothyng is made of nothyng. Who euer reaped Wheate or Barly without ſowing? who euer ſaw trees growe without planting, ſettinge, or ſpringing from ſome berrie, or kernell, or hearbes and flowers without ſeede or ſlippe? But hee that is the true creatour, hee maketh his matter and ſtuffe in whiche and of which hee woorketh, of nothing, hee hath it not alreadie prepared, or miniſtred from ſome other place. But to ſaie that the matter was coeternall with God himſelfe, or exiſting of it ſelfe, and to deny that it was firſte made and brought foorth by God out of nothing, is not the part of Chriſtians, but plainly of the Hermogenian heretikes. So that there is a moſte large diſtinction beetweene

creation, and engendring. Thoſe thinges are created, whiche are made of no ſubſtanciall or materiall beeginnyng. Thoſe are engendred or made, not whiche are made out of nothing, but out of a former ſubſtance and matter. Wherefore, neither good Angels nor bad, nor diuelles, bee, or ought to bee called creatours, mutch leſſe men: for it is onely proper to God to create, whiche theſe places following doe confirme, to wit, S. Auguſtine in his 3. booke of the Trinitie, the 8. chap. Iſay the 45. chapt. Iob the 26. chapt the 33 Pſalme, Actes the 17. chap. and 24. verſe. Yet am I not ignorant notwithſtandyng, what otherſome doe diſpute againſt this, that the power of creating may alſo bee giuen vnto creatures.
               
               
                  S.
                  But there be many thinges that doe withſtand your opinion.
               
               
                  M.
                  What bee they?
               
               
                  S.
                  Firſt that whiche your ſelfe alleaged, and is a moſte certeine poſition among the naturall Philoſophers, and confirmed in all mens iudgementes by continual experience: Nothyng is made of nothyng. How then ſhould God haue made al theſe thinges, if ſo bee that hee had no matter prepared to his hand, that is to ſay, if hee had nothing to make them of?
               
               
                  M.
                  Truely this is an olde obiection, and often repeated by Heathen men, in expoundyng whereof, Iuſtine the Martyr, or whoſoeuer he was elſe that anſwered the obiections of the Ethnikes, hee tooke great paines therin which difficultie mee thinkes I can eaſilye reſolue. Firſt in that the inſinite & incomprehenſible omnipotencie of God the creatour is not only a miſſe, but peruerſly called to the lawes of nature, which was made

and created. For what is that other, than to go about to make the creature equall to the Creatour? But as the Lorde witneſſeth, that his thoughtes doe differ farre from ours, ſo likewiſe is the force & power farre diſcrepant from ours, and farre excelling the ſtrength and vertue of this nature, Iob the 10. chapter, and 45. verſe. Now if a man woulde thus conclude: At this preſent, and ſince the tyme that the Lorde appointed this order, that nothing ſhoulde bee made of nothing, there is nowe nothing made without matter readye and prepared beefore. Wherefore in the beeginning, and before that God had ordeined theſe lawes, it toke place then, neither coulde anye thinge bee made other wiſe. Your ſelfe perceiue how much they are deceiued that doe ſo conclude. As, for example, if a man would thus diſpute, that in the beeginning the firſt trees, at the ſame verie inſtant wherin God made them, could not bring foorthe their fruites, bicauſe y• now adaies they bee not ſo forwarde, but neede longer time to beare and ripen them: if a man, I ſay, ſhoulde reaſon thus, euerie body woulde laughe him to ſkorne: and woulde perceiue that hys ſayinge were falfe, out of Iſay the 46. chapter, and▪ 8. verſe: and not onely out of the firſt Chapter of Moyſes. For whoſo were of that opinion, were deceiued through great ignorance and confuſion of diuerſe tymes, and conditions, which amonge thinges are to bee diſtinguiſhed. And euen ſo, they, who as you ſay, doe obiect againſt the firſt creation of thinges, That Nothing is made of nothing, bycauſe that nowe nothing is made of nothing, hee diſputeth of moſt different, and vnlike times, and conditions, To wit, from the nature whiche was to bee created

and not yet tied by any law, vnto the nature created & which is now reuoked & conſtrained by ſure & certein lawes. Which kynde of concluſion S. Auguſtine alſo laugheth at in his booke 2. booke againſt Pelagia, the 25. Chapter. Thus haue you my anſwere vnto that moſt common and vſuall argument of the Philoſophers. What is the ſeconde argument, which you ſay may be brought againſt vs?
               
               
                  S.
                  The aucthoritie which they alleage out of the xi. cha. and 18. verſe of the booke of VViſedome: For vnto thyne almightie hande that made the worlde out of a rude and vnfourmed matter, there lacked no ſtrength to ſende a multitude of beares, or of fierce Lions amonge them. Ergo the worlde was made of rude and vnformed matter, and not of nothyng. To which opinion Sainct Auguſtine ſeemeth to agree in the 3. booke, the 5. and 6. Chapters, of the Trinitie. For hee ſayth that There is a certaine common matter conſiſting in the cauſes of the worlde,
                  
               
               
                  M.
                  Indeede, this which you doe aleage, hath ſeemed vnto ſome to bee a verie forceable argument. And therfore ye materiar heretikes, which are called alſo ye 
                     Hermogenians, doe chiefly ſtaye themſelues vppon that, againſt whom Tertullian hath writen manye noble and learned woorkes. And that I may ſaye nothinge of the aucthoritie of that booke, lyke as I ſayde beefore: notwithſtanding I will anſwere this which is moſt true, that it is there taught and beleeued, yt the ſame rude and vnformed matter out of which it is ſaid the worlde was made, was firſt created by GOD of nothing, & not out of any other matter wrought or ſupplied, (for ſo ſhoulde wee runne foorth infinitely) neithere exiſtinge of it ſelfe, for then ſhoulde it bee verye

God. But whoſoeuer he was that wrote that booke, hee wrote in ſuch manner, out of the opinion whiche was then receiued and knowne amonge the Hebrue Rabbines, and was afterward alowed of and embraced of all, to wit, that heauen and earth (which two are ſaide in the 1. of Geneſis to haue beene created the firſte daye) were as it were the firſt matter of Gods woorkes which were created afterwarde, whiche God by his mightie vertue prepared vnto him ſelf and caſt togither, miniſtred firſt rudely whereby afterwarde hee might finiſhe and forme the reſidue of that ſo greate a woorke. And as touching Sainct Auguſtine, they that alleage him againſt vs, do altogither wreaſt hys auctority. For S. Auguſtine intreateth not there of the firſt matter of thys whole worlde, as though hee would haue it to bee one: or feigned or imagined it to bee coeternall with God: but hee ſpeaketh of the ſeconde matter, through which as in thinges nowe alreadye created, one thinge ſprunge of an other by the commaundement of GOD, as out of the earth trees and beaſtes, and as at thys daye alſo they are made and doe proceede. There was foreſowne ſaith hee, eeuen in thoſe thinges, the matter of ſuch thinges as aroſe and ſprung out of them: the 3. booke of Geneſis vppon the letter, the 14. chapter, and the 2. booke, the 15. chapter, and the 1. booke, the 14. and 15. Chapter: and the 5. booke, the 5. chap.
               
               
                  S.
                  Thirdly they ſaye, that yt is not the proper and naturall force and ſignification of this woorde, Create, For in the 43. chap. and 13. verſe of Iſay, the Lorde calleth himſelfe the creatour of Iſraell, which people notwithſtandinge are knowne to haue beene borne of ſeede. And againe, in in the 65. Chapter, and 18. verſe of the

ſame Prophet, he ſaith. Beeholde, I create Hieruſalem: Whiche place whether it bee vnderſtoode of the citizens or of the citie it ſelfe, it is certayne that God made neyther of them without ſeede, or matter, but the men of the one, and the Citie of the other. For this woorde Barah is vſed in both places, ſo that I am of opinion, that wee ought not to ſticke to religiouſly or perciſely to the interpretation of one poore woorde. Likewiſe they alleage this ſaying of the ſame Prophete: Beeholde, I create a newe heauen, and a newe earth: When as indeede the Lorde will onely renue theſe bodyes which nowe are heauen and earth, and not make thē again of nothing.
               
               
                  M.
                  It is writen in Iſay as you ſay. But theſe places doe plainly confirme mine opinion, much leſſe confute it. For the woorde, create, is taken Metaphorically, and wreſted a litle from the proper ſignificatiō, wherby the power of God may appeare the greater & more excellent in reſtoringe his people, and holy Citie beeſides al hope, and other thinges beeſides all ordinarie meanes. For lyke as the thinges that are created, are beeſides the courſe of nature made of nothinge, ſo likewiſe bycauſe the Lord promiſeth that hee will reſtore and renue his people and Citie, hee vſeth properly the woorde of creating, for that this which the Lord will woorke, is, as it were, a new creation, and a certayne won̄derfull bringing foorth and generation out of nothinge. Althoughe I will not deney, but that the ſignification of this word Barah is oftētimes tranſlated and vſed more largely: as when it is ſayd: Create a cleane hart within mee, O God, the 51. Pſalme, and 12. verſe: and againe, The ſeat of the frowarde createth iniquitie:
                     
                     Pſalme. 94. and 20. verſe. Of this ſayinge and opinion of Sainct Auguſtine, that I maye ſaye ſo much by the licence of ſo woorthy a man, I doe not well alowe. Who in his firſt booke againſt the aduerſaries of the lawe and the Prophetes, the 23 chap, writeth thus: And when there is anye difference made beetweene makinge and creatinge, this maye bee the oddes beetwene thoſe two woordes as I ſayde, that that is made which beefore was not at all, and that created which is ordeyned of ſumthinge that was beefore. Hee diſtinguiſhed thoſe two woordes, Make, and Creat, toto ſubtily whiche oftentimes are vſed one for an other.
               
               
                  S.
                  How then ſhould it bee?
               
               
                  M.
                  Thus the Scripture plainly defineth, to wit, that God is the creatour of the world, that is to ſay, of all thinges that are, who made, framed & brought foorth them all out of nothing, and not out of any matter preexiſting or made to his hande, or whiche is coeternall with God himſelf, or miniſtred vnto him by ſome other woorking God, as the Manichees doe ſuppoſe. For that opinion induceth two Goddes: and in making twayne, it leaueth none. For either there is no God, or there is but one. Finally, as ſaith S.

                  But there bee ſome that ſaie, that this matter is ſignified in the ſcripture by this woorde Tohu: where vpon afterward the Grecians, and the Philoſophers who receiued thoſe thinges firſt of the Hebrues, and of the Phenicians neere borderers to the Hebrues: whiche thei haue written concernyng the beeginnyng of the worlde:

thei deuiſed this woorde Hyle, by a ſmall alteration of certein letters made according to the vſe and proprietie of their tongue. For this woorde Hyle, ſaiethei, ſignifieth among the Grecians, as muche as a rude heape, vnformed, and as it were a certein moiſte and wateriſhe yearth, or quagmire, or dregges, out of whiche many thinges are engendred, through the force of the heate whiche commeth vnto it. From the whiche woorde Hyle, is the woorde Hilys deriued, which ſignifieth dregges and froath, that is to ſaye, a dirtie and moyſt earth, out of whiche many thinges doe growe in the Sea.

                  I doubted not, but thoſe that goe about to defend the ſame errour of theirs, concerning a firſte matter preexiſting, as though it were verie neceſſarie, and they that haue throughly receiued the ſame, doe deuiſe many ſuche fooliſhe fantaſies. But how ſmall or none at all the affinity of theſe two woordes is, Tohu and Hyle, in writing of the Letters, or rather how farre this is from the trueth, your ſelfe doe ſee, and it ſhall not bee needefull to ſeeke farther: foraſmuch as God is openly called the creatour of heauen and earth.

                  That was doone not raſhly nor in vaine, but to the intent to take awaye ſutch errours, as the ſpirite of God foreſawe would grow afterward amongſt men. For there are twoo errours among men, concernyng the beeginning of all thinges, beeſides the errour of

the materiare heretikes. For ſome thinke, that firſt and alwaies there was exiſting a certein whole maſſe, and that rude and confuſed, whiche was the heape of all the principall partes and thinges of the worlde whiche now are exiſting and fourmed, but then diſorderly mingled togither, which they call Chaos, And this opinion Heſiodus folowed in his Theogonia, whiche Ouid deſcribeth in his Metamorphoſis in theſe wordes.
                  
                     Beefore the ſea and lande were made, the heauen that all doth hide,
                     In all the worlde one onely face of nature did abyde,
                     Whiche Chaos hight, an huge rude heape, and nothinge elſe but eeuen.
                     An heauie lumpe and clottred clod of feedes togither driuen:
                     Of thinges at ſtrife amonge themſelues for want of order due.
                     No ſunne as yet with lightſome beames the ſhapeleſſe worlde did viewe. &c.
                  
                  This muche therefore they doe attribute vnto God, that hee is the diſtinguiſher, trimmer, and ſetter foorth of this ſo confuſed a Chaos, mole and heape: and not the creatour of it in time, giuinge vnto it the firſt meanes of beeinge. And therefore the Poet ſayde There was, as it were, from euerlaſting: and not the ſame Chaos was made and created by God. And for this cauſe they doe not call God the Creatour of the world, but onely the beutifier, and as Sainct Ambroſe ſayeth, the deuiſer of the ſhape and fourme thereof: as though hee hadde giuen a certeine comlineſſe and order vnto thinges that exiſted before, and which had of themſelues their owne proper ſtrength and nature, whiche hee accompliſhed by a certaine wiſe and apt diſtinction of them, and by ſeparating & diſtributing of euery part into it owne conuenient place. Otherſome there bee that doe

attribute more vnto GOD. For they holde opinion, that the matter was a great mole from eternitie, mary but matter onely, and not that althinges were encluded and comprehended within it (whiche the firſte ſorte doe alſo holde,) but that it was rude and vnſhapen. Which matter, for that it was great, GOD taking it in hande, diuided it into ſmale peaces: and, as hee is a moſte wiſe and cunninge woorkeman, facioned it into ſundrye fourmes. And ſo endued euerye parte thereof with hys owne & proper fourme, which wee ſee them nowe rertaine. Euen ſo out of one and the ſelfeſame barre of yron cut into ſundry pieces, the Smith frameth & forgeth a key, an hammer, a ſawe, fetters, and many other thinges ſeruinge to ſundrie purpoſes, whereof they tearme God Demiurgus, and not the creatour or maker. Howbeit the ſcripture attributeth all this vnto God. To wyt, both that they bee thinges, and alſo haue the ſame force, power, nature, and fourme, which wee ſee to bee in them. And finally, in that they are ſituate in ſuch place, and diſtinguiſhed in ſutch order as wee doe beeholde: that they decke foorth this mole in ſuch cumly ſorte as in hugeneſſe & beutie we do perceiue they do, and in ſuch maner as ther is no man able ſufficiently to expreſſe.

Wherefore, hee created Angels in heauen, and men vpon the earth, to the intent hee might make them, after a ſort, companions and partakers of his felicitie, beeing hymſelf moſt good, moſte louing, moſte perfect, and alſo in himſelfe and through himſelf moſt

                  M.
                  Both by auctoritie, and reaſon. And auctoritie is that whiche is cheifly taken out of the Scriptures: as the the 36. Pſalme, the 5. verſe: Lord, thy mercy ſtretcheth vnto the heauens. Pſalme
                      33. the 5. verſe: The earth is full of the mercy of the Lord. Pſalme
                      34, the 9. verſe: See how good the Lord is, and in the 103. Pſalme, the 17. verſe: The mercie of the Lord indureth from one age vnto another. And in the 111. Pſalme, and 4. verſe. But ſpecially in the 136. Pſalme, throughout, and in the Pſalme 145. and 9. verſe: The Lorde is good to all, and his mercies are ouer all his woorkes. And next out of the Fathers. For S. Auguſtine in his 1. booke of Geneſis vpon the letter, the 8. chapter: and alſo is his Enchiridion the 9. booke, ſayeth plainly, that the only goodnes of God was the cauſe, wherefore God made all theſe things. The ſame is likewiſe affirmed by Ireneus in his third boooke, the 45. and 46. chapters: and alſo by Fulgentius in his booke de fide ad Petr. the 3. chapt. And if you will alſo commend Heathen writers in this reſpect, you haue Plato in Timeo a moſt graue auctour among them, who beeing led by a naturall light, and the teſtimonie of his owne conſcience, wrote in this maner, whiche Cicero hath expreſſed is his booke de vniuerſitate: Let vs thā ſeeke out the cauſe which mooued hym that made theſe thinges, to beegin a new originall and frame of thinges. Hee was good: And hee that is good enuieth no man.
                      And therefore ſome ſay thus: God knew, and would haue his felicitie to bee communicated to others. For although that the diuine goodnes is, and was in God moſt fully and moſt perfectly without al theſe thinges, as it appeareth in the 60. Pſalme, and is alſo kepte vndefiled: Notwithſtandyng theſe things which are
                     
                     created are manifeſtatiue, as they ſpeake in the ſcholes, & do declare the excellencie of Gods goodnes, that is to ſaye, they ſhewe that the ſame goodnes is altogether agreeable vnto God. This muche ſay they.

                  Foraſmuche as there proceedeth nothyng from vs men, neither from the bleſſed and elect Angels, wherby God may be more eſtabliſhed in reſpect of his eternitie: or more bleſſed in reſpect of his ſtate and condicion, as it is written in the 16. Pſalme, and 2. verſe (for it is not poſſible that any thing ſhould bee added vnto hym, who of himſelf is altogether perfect) truely ther was no neede that draue him to make theſe thinges, but only this one cauſe, to wit, his owne louing good will. Wherefore, like as it is writen in the 3. chapter to Titus, the 4. verſe, that the mere goodnes of GOD was the cauſe of mans ſaluation: ſo was it alſo the cauſe of mans creation. And if it were the cauſe of men, doubtleſſe it was alſo the cauſe of the creation of all other thinges.

                     I Do wel vnderſtand ſo much as you haue hetherto ſayd of God, who is the efficient cauſe of thys world, not as a woorkeman onely, or a diſcriber, or painter, or trimmer vp: but rather as a creator, and a bringer foorth of it out of nothyng. Tell mee now this one thing more, whether in reſpect of theſe cauſes this

world may bee called the Sunne of God?
               
               
                  M.
                  You renue an old queſtion, which S. Auguſtine plainly diſcuſſeth in his Enchiridion, the 38. and 39. chapters. Truely if we will ſpeake properly and to vnderſtandyng, this world neither can nor ought bee called the Sun of God. Firſt, bicauſe it is not made of the ſubſtance of GOD. For they that are properly called a mans children or ſunnes, are beegotten of the fathers ſeede and ſubſtance. Moreouer, whatſoeuer is ſaid to ſpring and come of another, ought not by and by to be called the ſunne of that from whiche it ſpringeth. For Lice doe breede out of a mannes fleſhe, yet are thei not called the ſunnes of men, or of their fleſhe. To cōclude ſince the compariſon and reſpecte of GOD vnto the worlde, is rather like the woorkeman to the woorke, than like the Father to the Sunne, truely the worlde may bee termed the woorke and perfected labour of God, but by no meanes called his Sunne.

Neither do I thinke it woorth the traueill to confute the opinions of the Philoſopers, who haue almoſte euerie one of them ſtūbled at this block: or elſe to conuince

the hereſie of the Hermogenians, who reuoked that errour, whiche was nowe long ſince extinguiſhed in the Churche of God, out of the ſcooles and opinions of the Stoikes: and choſe rather to learne how the world beegan, at the handes of naturall Philoſophers than of true Chriſtians, and out of Gods woord. Al whoſe argumentes, Tertullian hath confuted in a noble and profitable woorke, whiche is now abroade in mens handes, and is moſt worthie to bee read.
               
               
                  S.
                  I doe not require after that which was not, but this rather, whether that among thoſe thinges whiche God created of nothing, there were any thing diſpoſed, prepared, and brought foorth, that afterward ſerued the turne, and ſtoode in ſteede in the creation of other things, out of which God did afterward facion and fourme al thinges elſe that remained to be made?
               
               
                  M.
                  You mooue mee to enter into a difficult queſtion, which conſiſteth both of like number of weightie reaſons, and of auctorities of graue writers. For among the learned auctours, ſome thinke that Heauen and earth, of whiche in the 1. chapt. of Geneſis, and 1. verſe it is writen, In the beginnyng God made heauen and earth, were made by God of nothyng: howbeit, firſt, and before all thinges, to the intent that they might be the prepared matter of all other thinges that were to be afterward created. And therfore, they ſay, that God did nothyng the other daies following, but onely diſtinguyſh this matter and maſſe which was firſt confuſedly brought foorth, and conteined in it the ſeedes of all other thinges into the proper kindes and elementes, and that euerie thing ſhould be trimmed foorth in it owne kind, and gouerned by it owne lawe. Other dooe ſuppoſe

otherwiſe, that theſe thinges were only ſet downe in the beginning, as it were, in maner of a preface or ſuppoſition of ſome diſcourſe that ſhould enſue, to the end that the ſumme of the whole matter following might be the better vnderſtoode, and the boundes of ſo great a frame as the world is, bee drawne foorth. In like maner, cunning Carpenters when they are about to build ſome goodly and large houſe, they firſte drawe out a platfourme in certeine proportions and lines, conteining the fourme of the whole woork that ſhalbee, to the intent, they may point out and place the other roomthes of the buildyng within that circuite, & ſo conteine themſelues within thoſe limites. Thus, ſay they, heauen and earth are propoſed by Moſes, and that in the beeginning of his Narration, to the ende, wee might vnderſtande what limites the diſcription following, and the whole woorke ſhould haue: Like as he alſo repeateth again thoſe limites after the narration of the creation, & concludeth the whole woorke whiche hee ſet foorth, after the ſame manner. Geneſis the 2. chapter, and 1. verſe. Wherefore, In the beginnyng God created heauen and earth, that is to ſaye, firſte of all the ſumme of all Gods woorkes is layd beefore vs to bee thought on. Moreouer, Ireneus in his 2. booke, the 10. 11. and 16. chapters, ſheweth that GOD is not like men, as not hauing neede of any matter that hee had created or prepared before hand, to finiſh or make his other woorkes of.
               
               
                  S.
                  Howe then, doe you thinke otherwiſe?
               
               
                  M.
                  Truely, the interpretation and opinion of the fyrſte ſorte ſeemeth vnto mee the more probable, which hold that the heauen and earth (in ſuche maner as thei are

there ſpoken of) were firſte created by GOD of nothing, howbeit as it were, a rude matter of the whole woorke and bewtie that ſhoulde folowe, out of which God by his mightie power brought foorth all the reſidue. Although almightie God lacked no matter to create firſte heauen and earth with all, neither yet to bring forthe the woorkes of the other daies, like as at this day alſo he needeth not the ſeede of man to bryng foorth men of, if hee luſt to doe otherwiſe: notwithſtanding in theſe queſtions wee muſt not enquire how much hee was able to doe, ſayeth S. Auguſtine in his 2. booke de Geneſi, but rather what ye courſe of nature in things will ſuffer, and what his pleaſure is, and what hee hath reuealed vnto vs by his woorde. Neither doth this mine opinion want iuſt and ſufficient confirmation, either of the auctoritie of men, or of reaſon. And as for auctoritie there is none againſt mee, ſeeing bothe Philo Iudaeus, and the Rabbines commonly, and the beſt learned of the Hebrues doe ſo expounde that place of Moſes: yea, S. Auguſtine alſo oftentimes, as in the 5. booke de Ge neſi ad Literam, the 3. and 5. chapters: and the 1. booke, the 5. chapter. S. Ambroſe likewiſe in Examero, and S. Chryſoſtome, and S. Baſile, with others.

                  But can you confirme your opinion by any reaſon?
               
               
                  M.
                  Yea, by twaine. And the firſt is, that this expoſition doth very well agree with Moſes woordes, and order: and againe, that it ſeemeth to be plainly confirmed by this woord Beeginning, and the ſignification therof. For a beeginning is ſayd in compariſon of other thinges. And therefore, to the intent hee might ſhewe how all other thinges were made afterwarde out of thoſe twayne, Moſes plainly vſeth this preface, to wit, that

the ſame heauen, and the ſame earth were created in the beeginning, that is to ſaye, beefore all the other woorkes that God made, and alſo to the vſe of all the other, that is to ſaie, from whence afterward the reſidue were taken, and as it were, made. The very footſteppes, as it were, of whiche opinion, howbeeit the trueth beeyng now and then manifeſtly intercepted, do appeare to be exſtant in Heſiodus in his Theogonia, and Ouid alſo in that place of the firſte booke of his Metamorphoſis, which is ſo well knowne: Beefore the Sea and Earth, &c. This reaſon alſo may bee alleaged, that the thing itſelf, and ſpecially the earth, is thus deſcribed vnto vs, and is called by Moſes Tohu and Bohu: whereby it appeareth that there was a certein Maſſe, ſtuffe, and matter prepared by GOD, for the world that ſhould afterwarde bee made, whiche was then firſte onely, and not prepared from euerlaſting. Yea, it cannot bee denied but that at that tyme there was ſome confuſion euen in heauen, when as the heauenly and earthly ſubſtances were not as yet diſtinguiſhed & ſeparated one from another, whiche at length was brought too paſſe. And that alſo there was no beutie, nor brightnes as yet in heauen, neither was there any light ſhining therein. Howbeeit that confuſion was greater vpon the earth. And therefore in reſpect thereof it was called Tohu and Bohu.

                  Firſt, they ſignifie ſome vnformed, rude, & confuſed thing, but yet apt and diſpoſed to admitte and receiue fourme and ſhape. And therefore the ſcripture vſeth this kinde of ſpeache, when it will ſignifie ſome vnpoliſhed and vndigeſted thyng, as it appeareth in Iſay, the 34. chapter, and 11. verſe: and the 40. chapter. and 17. verſe. Wherefore, ſuch was the ſhape of the earth at that time, as for the moſt part the Poete Ouid expreſſeth in theſe woordes.

                     No kinde of thing had proper ſhape, but eche confounded other. &c
                  
                  Moreouer, as ther are two chiefe kindes of althings, one heauenly, the other earthly: euen ſo at the beginninge God created two ſortes of matter, God I ſay, who knewe well ynough of what and how manifolde natures the thinges ſhould bee that hee would make, and did thē make but preparation for them. For heauen was prepared, as a perfect and heauenly matter, of the heauenly partes of the worlde. And the earth of the earthly, which earth at that time moiſte, wet, & mooriſhe, ouer which the water was ſpread abroad for this cauſe, as it is writen in the 104. Pſalme and 6. verſe. that there ſhoulde bee then onely one bodye extant, conſiſting of two elementes. And as for heauen, Moſes tarieth leſſe time in the declaration therof, what manner a thinge it was at that time, for that it was

a thing better formed and compounded. But in diſcribinge the ſtate of the earth, hee vſeth moe woordes. For hee calleth that firſt and material earth. Tohu and Bohu, that is to ſay, a certeine confuſed maſſe: ſuch an one as wee muſt needes imagine it to haue been, if a man will in minde take from it that bewtie and order which the Lorde added vnto it afterwarde.

                  What, therefore, doeth this worde Tohu ſignifie in the Scriptures.
               
               
                  M.
                  That which wee call emptie and deſolate, to wit, that wherefore there is no vſe & commoditie, neither bringeth fruite, nor yeldeth profit: and to bee ſhorte, that is woorth nothinge. Whereby it commeth to paſſe, that this woorde is many tymes tranſlated for Nothing: as in Iob the 26. chapter, and the 7. verſe: and in Iſay the 24. Chapter, the 10. and 40. verſes, a litle before the ende. Wherefore, the force and ſignification of this woorde Tohu, excludeth that commoditie whiche at this preſent wee receiue out of the earth.

                  The ſame amonge the Hebrues that wee call vnſhapen and vnformed: and that is vnſhapen, from whiche all diſtinction, order, apte and conuenient placing of the partes is abſent, and that which repreſenteth to the beholders nothing but confuſion and horrour: and yet notwithſtanding, this wanted not all forme, as hauing a name, and beeing called the earth. And thus is it taken in Iſay the 29. Chapter, and 21. verſe.

Paule ſaieth in the 2. to the Corinthians, the 4, chapiter, and 5. verſe, hath brought forthe ſo wonderfull a beautie, and light, and cōmoditie out of ſo great confuſion and darkeneſſe of all thinges: and alſo that that thing whiche was firſt ordeined to bee as it were the matter, receiuer, and mother of ſundrie fourmes, ought to bee ſuche a maner of thing. Although I confeſſe that the earth had it owne proper fourme from the verie firſt moment of the creation thereof, but yet ſuche an one, in reſpect whereof wee take it for a matter vnto other thinges that might afterward receiue other fourmes. And therefore you ſee how fairely and plainly this matter, this earth (as it is declared) is prepared and diſpoſed, to receiue afterward the fourmes of thinges in it.

                     unixtion of the water and earth togither, was verie neceſſarie vnto this that wee ſpeake of, to wit, that the earth ſhould bee a good,

commodious, and well prepared matter for all earthly thinges, whiche it pleaſed God ſhould riſe out of it.

                  It behooued, that the ſeede and matter of all thinges ſhould bee apte to bee fourmed, pliant, and tractable, whiche in the earth could not bee without moiſture. Wherefore, the earth whiche of it owne nature is a drie and hard thing, not cleauyng togither, and not apt to bee drawne forthe in length or breadth, vnleſſe it bee made ſuche, and tempered with ſome moiſture that maie molliſie it and binde it togither: had water ioyned with it. And therefore that huge multitude of waters, whiche is called the deapthes, was created, and comprehended in the ſame body, vnder whiche the earth vnſhapen was concluded, and laye hid. Wherby it appeareth that this whole maſſe was a greater Chaos, & more difficult to bee manifeſted: out of whiche notwithſtandyng God hath brought forthe ſo greate beautie, order, brightneſſe, comelineſſe, yea and that moſte comely. All whiche thinges I would in long diſcourſe prooue too haue been of neceſſitie in the firſte matter, yea, and that by the auctoritie of the Prophane Philiſophers them ſelues, vnleſſe the place of ſcripture did confirme it plainly enough.

                     Moſes ſaieth, and darkneſſe was vppon the deapthes, and the Spirite of God mooued vppon the waters, Geneſis
                      the firſt chapter, and 2. verſe: ſo that wee are enforced to defende twoo poinctes, whiche make for my ſide, againſte the opinions of all the Philoſophers. The firſte is, that the matter of all the woorkes whiche God made afterwarde, was not any ſmall thyng, or imagination in

mynde, rather than in mole of bodie comprehenſible: but that it was that huge mole and globe, whiche beyng afterwarde diuided into partes, conteined this earth whiche wee goe vppon, and the great ſea whiche wee ſayle vpon. They imagine of the firſt matter, as if it were ſome thin and flittring ſhadow, and altogither without forme, which can not bee. For a thing that exiſteth can not bee without all forme: and what ſoeuer is without fourme, is nothing, and therefore is not at all. Of whiche it is thus written in the boke againſt the foundations and groundes of the Manichees Epiſtles, the 29. chapter: A certeine vnſhapen matter without fourme, without qualitie, without meaſure, without number, without weight, without order and diſtinction, a certaine confuſed thinge, I wote not what, and wholy without all qualitie: Whereof it commeth, that certaine Greeke Doctours doe call it 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , that is to ſaye, without qualitie. But Sainct Auguſtine mocketh at this opinion. The ſecond is, that there cannot be one firſt matter cōmune vnto all thinges viſible, held and eſtabliſhed, but there muſte bee diuerſe, to wit, one of heauenly things, which is heauen: the other of earthly thinges, which are the earth and the water, whiche is both comprehended with it in one body, and created alſo at the ſame time to ſoften the earth: which three thinges were firſt made of nothinge.

                  Euen the ſame plainly which afterward is called the ſea but y• 
                     Grecians terme it Abyssus, & the Hebrues Tehom. And it is called Abyssus, the deapthes, bycauſe ſo great Pooles & collections togither of waters, are without bottome ſo farre as may bee knowne, felte, or vnderſtoode,

ſo wide and deepe they are. But it is called Tehom bycauſe it is mooued with an horrible noyſe, and terrible roaring, inſomuch as it ſwelleth and ebbeth, and floweth of it owne nature, and neuer ſtandeth ſtill.
               
               
                  S.
                  But this is the queſtion, whether thoſe deapthes and moles of water, were mingled with the earth within, in the veines and hollowe paſſeges there of, or onely abidinge vpon the vppermoſt face of the earth: if you ſay that it couered onely the vppermoſt face, the mole of the earth beeing ſo big as it is, could not by meanes thereof wax ſoft: but if it were mingled with the earth, you ſhall both make the Chaos more horrible, and better conceiue the melting and ſofteninge of that harde nature, and element. For as I ſuppoſe, you doe not agree with thoſe who are of opinion, that thoſe deapthes of waters were only a thinand rare cloud whiche couered the earth, whereof Sainct Auguſtine maketh reporte.
               
               
                  M.
                  Indeede I doe not agree with them: neither doe I doubt but that by anye of both thoſe meanes whiche you haue declared, the Chaos maye bee ſhowed and thought to bee great and horrible, whether the deapthes of water bee mingled with the earth, or onelye abiding vpon the vppermoſt part of it. Neither can it bee doubted, but that y• body of the earth being ouerflowen and compaſſed with ſo many, & ſo great waters, was then ſufficiently infuſed and ſoked. Notwithſtanding, to the ende I maye declare, what ſeemeth to mee may bee determined in this queſtion out of the woorde of God, I will alleage that whiche is written in the 104. Pſal. and 6. verſe, where ſpeaking

of the earth, it ſaith thus: Thou coueredſt it with the pooles, like as with a garment: ſo that euery part of the deapthes and waters, were not mingled with euery part of the earth, as they ſupoſe, but the whole mole of waters compaſſed the whole body of the earth, and flected vpon the vppermoſt face therof. As afterward it came to paſſe in the diluge in the tyme of Noe. Of which opinion this is alſo a reaſon, that when the Spirite of God, and the darkeneſſe lay vpon that vnſhapē mole, it is not written that they laye vpon the earth it ſelfe but vppon the vpper parte of the waters and pooles, ſo that it plainely apeareth that the earth was included & couered with thoſe deapthes & pooles. Moreouer, when as the thirde daye the deapthes were ſeparated from the earth, the waters were onely gathered togither frō that compaſſyng & ſpreading abroad vpon the earth, but is not ſaide that the waters were wron̄g out of the earth, as out of a ſpunge, which thē was alſo needefull to haue beene done.

                  M.
                  Uerely, to the intent that the infinite vertue, wiſedome, and power of the true God might thereby the more plainly appeere, who out of ſo confuſed a male, and ſo many impediments concurring, hath ſo ſoone, and by his ſo greate force brought foorth ſo beautifull an order of all thinges, yea, when

there was no meane at all exiſting, but rather the cō
                     trarie, to diſtinguiſhe and ſet foorth the ſame with all: as S. Paule ſheweth in the 2. too the Corinthians, the 4. chapter, and 6. verſe: for all thinges are wount to bee diſtinguiſhed in the light. Wherfore, beeſides the confuſion of the mole, darkeneſſe alſo was an impedimēt vnto God. How then did God woorke, and diſtinguiſhe theſe thinges, when there was darkeneſſe? Doubtleſſe by his greate and almightie power. For the darkeneſſe ſpecially augmenteth the horrour of ſo greate a confuſion, and doth cauſe that the diſtinguiſhing and diuiding of theſe thinges ſeemeth to bee a woorke altogether impoſſible. For, if ſo bee that vnto that which is confuſed and intricate, darkeneſſe alſo bee added, all hope and meanes of opening and cleering the ſame is taken away: that whoſoeuer ſhall diuiſe in his minde the meanes whiche the Lord toooke firſt in hande to create & diſtinguiſh this world by, the ſame may cauſe it not onely to ſeeme to bee a woorke full of difficulty, but alſo of great impoſſibilitie. And whoſoeuer ſhall behold the beautie and fourme of the world, as it is now diſtinguſhed, will iudge that this woorke was framed and made of principles and partes very wel digeſted and ordered, and that there was light firſt beefore there was any other thing made.

                  M.
                  Uerely the Manichees were deceiued in thinking ſo vnaduiſedly,

and marking ſo fondly. Yea, and the Valentinians alſo their Patriarkes for this cauſe were deceiued. For, beeing led by their owne wicked thoughtes in this kinde of argument, they ſayd, that this world, and the firſt beginning therof, were the matter, fruite, and effect of a certein foule imperfection & ignorance in God, and not the woorke of a wiſe God or woorkman, whiche can not bee read without horrour and trembling. Againſt whom, Father Ireneus writeth cloquently and ſharply in his 2. booke, and 3. chap. But now that I may anſwere, and alleage that which belongeth to this queſtion: I ſay, that the Lorde, who made all thinges to the intent hee might make the ritches of his glorie and power knowne, would ſpecially reueale hymſelf in creatyng the world by this meanes and maner, and by vſing the ſame to that purpoſe. Wherefore, like as it was the parte of a moſte wiſe God, to finde out and chooſe the way that he thought moſt conuenient to reueale himſelfe: ſo is it likewiſe our duetie too allowe, reuerence, and adore the ſame that hee hath choſen. For faithe ought to bee the rule and leader of our mindes to vnderſtande theſe woorkes of God by, whiche vnleſſe wee followe, wee ſhall conceiue nothing holſomly or profitably in all this whole woorke of God, bee it neuer ſo wide and beautifull. For as it is writen in the 11. chapt. and 3. verſe to the Hebrues: By faith we vnderſtand that the world was made.
                      And therefore wee ought not to followe the reaſon of our owne braines in defining theſe matters.

maketh to bee the thirde beeginning of all naturall thinges, in his 1. booke of Phyſikes?
                  Fye, awaye with this Priuation, as a dreame or dotage, in reſpect of a beeginning of the world. For how can a Priuation, whiche is nothing, bee called the cauſe of a thing? as though a man would defend that fyre were the cauſe of cold. Moreouer, Ariſtotles Priuatiō ſticketh faſt infuſed in the matter: but the darkneſſe whereof Moſes ſpeaketh, was without the bodie of the matter, and brought no commoditie to the taking of a fourme, which Ariſtotles priuation doth: yea, the darkeneſſe rather tooke away al hope of receiuing fourme, ſo that Ariſtotles opinion is quite repugnant to Moſes.

                  M.
                  For many cauſes, ſpecially for three. Firſte, that the creation of the world might bee vnderſtoode, not only to bee the woorke of the Father, and of the Sunne, but alſo of the holy ghoſt, who is likewiſe in perſon diſtinct from them twaine. Howbeit, if wee conſider more narrowly of the woord, The ſpirit of GOD, noteth vnto vs in that place not the third perſon in Trinitie, whiche is infinite, and comprehended in no place, but onely a certein effect, and power, and preſence which reuealed and manifeſted it ſelfe there. But it is cōmon

in the ſcripture, that the giftes and tokens of the holy Ghoſte, are taken for the holy Ghoſte himſelfe, and when they are recited, hee likewiſe is vnderſtoode to bee there by his owne ſpecial meanes, as appeareth in the 3. chap. of S. Matthewe, becauſe wee cannot know hym any other way than through thoſe his effectes, and giftes. Whererefore, the Spirite of God, had alſo his owne proper function and office, openly and diſtinctly in the creation of this world. Secondly. that wee might know by what power and ſpirite that firſt mole, whiche was ſo greate, was at the beeginning ſuſteined and helde vp. Truely not of it ſelf, neither by the waters that were round about it, neither by the darkneſſe that was vppon it, whiche rather couered that firſte matter whiche was now a growing, as it were in a wombe, and made it an vntimely fruite: but by the almightie ſpirite of God, whiche ſuſteineth and quickneth all thinges by his diuine power, by whom that huge and vnprofitable mole of earth and water, ſubſiſted, flouriſhed, was quickned, was ſuſteined, was reteined, and as I may ſaye, made aliue: to the ende wee ſhould aſcribe all theſe thinges, and their vertues, onely to the glorie of God.

                  For that all thynges at this preſent, doe ſubſiſte and are ſuſteined by the ſpirite of God: although now thei haue gotten their peculiare force and nature, and yet were not deſtitute thereof at that tyme, as it is written in the 146. Pſalme, and 5. verſe: and the 139. and 7. verſe: Likewiſe in the 1. to Timothe, the 6. Chapter, and 13. verſe: and Actes the 1. chapter, the 28. verſe.

                  To the ende it might bee the better declared by what meanes, moouing, and proceeding all thinges were by God drawne foorth, and framed out of that firſte matter and mole. Euen as wee ſee at this day, that the firſte See
                        •
                     es of thinges, after that once they bee ſowne, by Gods power are not onely ſuſteined, but alſo nouriſhed, quickned, and made warme, and ſo doe burgein, and ſendfoorth that bodie which naturally they conteined with in thē: ſo was it in y• firſt matter of all thinges, ſo that the ſame Spirite by his power did ſuſteine and nouriſhe the firſt ſeedes of thinges, and now alſo continually mooueth the ſame: howbeit, that ſame action was then more manifeſtly declared, in that there was not as yet any ordinarie vertue of engendring or bringing foorth, engraffed into things by the word of God: for that was giuen afterwarde. And therefore the ſpirite of GOD manifeſted himſelf mightily in thoſe thinges, and nouriſhed that mole. Whiche thing Moſes alſo teacheth plainly, in that kind of phraſe which hee vſeth.

                  M.
                  To wit, that the Spirite of God had giuen a lyuely force vnto that greate mole, not onely by whiche it ſhould exiſt, ſuſteine, and as it were beare vp it ſelfe: but alſo that it ingraffed, engendred, & raiſed vp in it a

hot, as it were, to conceiue, and to bringe foorth. For the Hebrue woorde Merachephet ſignifieth, both thoſe thinges, not onely, I ſaye, to ſuſteine and mooue, but alſo to nouriſh, as birdes do nouriſh their yoūg ous: & alſo to giue force to wax warme, & to moue it ſelf: Deuteron the 32. chapter, and 11. verſe: which Sainet Paule ſeemeth to tranſlate, to cheriſh, to y• 
                     Epheſians y• 5. chapter, and 29. verſe. Likewyſe, as the ſame Spirite of GOD is ſayde in the 139. and 7. verſe, to woorke, and to bee ſent foorth, to the intent that at thys preſent alſo things may bee ingēdered, & brought foorth. Who, if hee ſhoulde ceaſe or bee taken away, nothing would grow, although the ſeedes of thē were ſowne, and men labored and toyled all that they coulde, but woulde lye choaked within the bowels of the earth, & wombes of their mothers.

                  But why is the action and woorking of that ſpirite, diſcribed, as it were, by a certaine wagging and moouing of himſelfe, and breathing foorth of a winde?
               
               
                  M.
                  Bicauſe the ſignification of the preſence and action of the Holy Ghoſt, is expreſſed by thys moouing, & breathing: like as in an other place, the Doue was the ſignification of the preſence of the ſame holy ſpirite, Mathew the 3. chapter and 16. verſe. In an other place alſo the firie tongues, were ſeales and ſignes of his operation and giftes▪ 
                     Actes the 1. Chapter. And in an other place alſo blowinge and breathinge out of the mouth: Ihon the 20. Chapter, and 22. verſe: Although the ſame Spirite of God, which is GOD alſo, is not a winde indeede, howbeeit his woorking is ſignified and noted by this miſterie of moouing, & breathing: for hee is a quickninge Spirite: and lyfe is ſpecially

knowne by wagginge and moouinge, and diſcerned from death, which is an euerlaſting and ſenſeleſſe quietnes of all thinges. So that it is ſufficiently declared by that kinde of the miſterie, to what end the ſpirit of God was preſent, and alſo what hee did, to wit, hee gaue force vnto thinges.
               
               
                  S.
                  But why did that ſpirite remaine vppon the vppermoſt face of the waters, for aſmuch as Moſes ſayde not, that the water was created beefore: and hee mighte alſo haue lyen in the middes of this mole, and ſo haue warmed and ſuſteyned the whole maſſe within as it were leauen, or a fire?
               
               
                  M.
                  That ye water was created by God at one time with the firſt earth, Moſes declareth ſufficiently, when he addeth by and by, and darkeneſſe was vpon the face of the deapths, that is to ſaye, vpon the mole of waters. And theſe woordes doe declare, that both thoſe elements made but the mole of one bodye, whiche truely at the firſte was diſordred, & conſiſted of them twaine togither & herein ther can conſiſt no doubt. But why that force and ſpirite of GOD, did ſpecially appeare in the top of the waters, that is to ſay, of the whole mole, and not in the bottom or middes, the reaſon is this: not that it did not pearce alſo vnto the very deapthes, but ſuſteined onely the vppermoſt face of the mole (for the Spirite of God reached at that time euen vnto Hell. Pſalme 139. the 5. verſe. & filled alſo with his power, and went throughout euery parte of this mole, were it neuer ſo ſecret & hiddē) but foraſmuch as it pleaſed God that all theſe thinges ſhoulde ſo bee extant and doone, to the ende his power ſhoulde bee manifeſt, open and eaſie to bee knowne, not hid and couered▪ it was behouefull

that his miſterie and tokens ſhould appeare and ſhowe themſelues in the vppermoſte parte and openly, not in the bottome of the whole mole, or in the middeſt thereof, that is to ſaye, in ſecrete and out of fight. Moreouer, it was neceſſarie that the ſame ſpirite ſhoulde compaſſe and nouriſh the whole mole, and not one parte onely: whiche came to paſſe by the houering and moouing of the ſame Spirite about the whole mole.
               
               
                  S.
                  Why doth hee call them earth, water, and heauen, whiche were not yet diſtinct by that name, or ſeparated by their proper natures? for they were ſo called the daies followyng, after that theſe thinges were diuided one from another.
               
               
                  M.
                  As for heauen, God had made it at that time, and it was called heauen, but the Etymon and cauſe of the name is vnderſtoode by the latter woorkes, whiche was the ſtretching foorth, and the woorkmanſhip of the ſecond day. And thus are thei termed heauen and earth by anticipation, leſte if theſe bodies were ſignified by no names, the thinge it ſelf could not bee declared. Beeſides this, inaſmuch as theſe thinges are alſo afterward called by their owne proper names, it is a ſigne, that there is none other ſubſtance added vntoo them, but the ſame reteined which was in them, when as yet they were confuſed: but onely beautie added, whereby they were dinſtinguiſhed from other thinges of diuerſe kindes, and alſo made more beautifull in themſelues.

                  What? doe you allowe and renue the opinion of Anaxagoras, who thincketh, that in the beeginninge all things were mingled togither, and that euery thing

was made one of an other, and termeth the firſte beginninge of all thinges, but a diſtinction and ſeparation out of a certain confuſed heape, wherin they were beefore?
               
               
                  M.
                  No not ſo: for I doe not ſaye, that within the ſame, mole of earth, whereof I doe now diſpute, there were hidden and buried trees alreadye framed, men fourmed, or cattell and beaſtes ſhapen, and that they were couered and infoulded within certeine plightes and fouldes, and ſo were extant, as Anaxagoras thought: but Moſes confuteth this, who ſheweth, yt thoſe things which were brought forth the daies following, were made, and not onely ſeuered, neither taken and ſeparated, as it were, out of a certeine heape, and ſtoarehouſe of all thinges. Howebeeit, I maye truely ſaye with Sainct Auguſtine, that the ſeedes of all thinges were at the firſt, yea, and that throughly infuſed into that firſt matter: which ſeedes were not diuerſe from the ſubſtance of the earth, and yet laye hidden within the bowels thereof: but the earth beeing made apt by the woorde and woorking of the Spirite, did afterwarde bringe foorth thoſe thinges, which it pleaſed God ſhoulde bee in the worlde. To conclude, howe ſhoulde wee bringe in this Anaxagoras confuſion, ſince wee reade ſo playnely in the holy Scripture, that the matter of heauenly thinges is diuerſe and ſeparated, from the matter of earthly thinges? And, as I ſuppoſe, that heauen which as it is written, God made the fyrſt daye when he made the earth, was the matter of all heauenly thinges.

                  M.
                  That it was not this place, whiche is called the aire, or this open ſpreadyng abroade, whiche was created the ſeconde daie, Geneſis the 1. chapter, and 8. verſe: but rather that the matter of heauenly thynges was by God prepared, whiche by a generall name is called heauen.
               
               
                  S.
                  What maner of thyng was that heauen, whiche you call the matter of heauenly thynges?
               
               
                  M.
                  Uerely, firſte it was obſcure and darcke, although it were made of a moſte ſubtile and fine ſubſtaunce, but vnſhapen and diſorder, not trimme to ſight, nor ſeparated by ſpace or diſtaunce of place, from the mole of earth and water: as it appeareth in the 1. Chapter of Geneſis, and 6. verſe, but was as yet neere vnto it, and touched it.
               
               
                  S.
                  What, was it needfull alſo, that the heauenly matter ſhould bee ſtieped in the water, as the earthly was, to the ende that the heauēly bodies ſhould afterward bee made thereof?
               
               
                  M.
                  Fie for ſhame. Wee read not that thoſe heauenly bodies, to wit, the Sunne, the Moone, the ſtarres, and all that whiche is called the region of heauen, whiche God hath placed aboue the elementes, were ſo made out of heauen, as the earthly were made out of the earth. For like as it is ſaid in the 1. chap. and 11. verſe of Geneſis, Let the earth bring foorth euery greene hearbe that beareth ſeede, and let the water bring foorth fiſh,
                      the 1. chap. of Geneſis, and 20. verſe: ſo is it not likewiſe written and comaunded

by God, let heauen bring foorth the Sunne and the Moone: but onely thus, Let there bee lightes in the face of the open heauen. Geneſis
                      the 1. chapter, and 14. verſe. Whereby it ſufficiently appeareth, that the firſte Heauen, was not in ſuche manner the matter of heauenly things, as it were a certein plentiful and frutefull Father of them: neither that the matter of heauenly thinges was ſo ordeined, as the earth was appointed by GOD too bee the matter, and mother of earthly thinges.
               
               
                  S.
                  Why would the Lorde haue thinges ſo diuerſly to bee made out of thoſe matters, and that heauenly thinges ſhould not bee made out of heauen, as well as the earthly are out of the earth?
               
               
                  M.
                  Not onely for this cauſe, that like as they were made by hym of diuerſe matter, and differing in kinde (although they bee all partakers of bodie) ſo likewiſe it beehooued them to declare their vſe, and execute their duetie in diuerſe maner, too the ende, their difference might bee vnderſtoode and perceiued: but alſo that God might reueale vntoo vs the better, his mightie power, and alſo his manifolde wiſedome in ſo greate varietie of bringing foorth thinges. So likewiſe in the framing of man onely, God hath vſed one meane in creating his bodie, and another his ſoule, and by thoſe meanes continually createth and maketh them, notwithſtanding that hee is able to make them both by one meane.

                  I will doe ſo.

                  What therefore, is the fourme of this ſo greate a woorke?
               
               
                  M.
                  There cannot bee one onely, and that ſubſtantiall, thereof aſſigned. For as I haue ſhewed beefore, it is not poſſible that there ſhould bee one onely, and particulare ſoule of all the worlde, whiche beeyng diſperſed throughout euerie parte of the bodie thereof, ſhould wag, ſtirre, and mooue this ſo hugie frame and mole: whatſheuer the Ariſtotelians and Platonikes doe ſuppoſe. Likewiſe, S. Auguſtine in his 7. booke de Geneſiad Literam, and 12. chapter, doeth iuſtly deney, that GOD is the ſoule of this worlde, as of ſome liuing creature, foraſmuche as hee dwelleth aboue the bodie of the worlde, and aboue euery Spirite, and ſtretcheth beeyonde the endes of the whole worlde. But God hath giuen vnto euery kinde, his proper nature and forme▪ whiche are diſputed of in ſpeciall treatiſes, which are written of euery kinde of thyng. As for roundeneſſe, whiche ſome attribute to the worlde, as the naturall fourme thereof: it ought not too bee counted or called the inward or eſſentiall forme of the worlde, but onely the outward and accidentall.
               
               
                  S.
                  But, dooeth not the Scripture attribute vnto the world partes, and differences of ſituation, as it were to a liuyng creature, and countries, and regions alſo diſtinct one from another?
               
               
                  M.
                  It doeth ſo indeede, but notwithſtanding it prooueth

not, that there is but one and theſelf ſame fourme, ſpirite and ſoule beelongyng to this worlde, and that it is a liuyng creature.

                  M.
                  For, foraſmuche as there bee three kindes of bodies, and ioynynges in compoſition: one ſimple and continuall, as a man: the ſeconde ioyned and touchyng one another, as an whole houſe: the third diſioyned, as a flocke: it is truely ſaied, that euery kinde of bodie, as it were, a certeine whole thyng, hath euermore ſome partes, into whiche it is deuided, and alſo ſundrie differences of place and ſituation, whiche may bee noted in it: howbeeit, euery kinde of bodie is not gouerned by one ſoule onely, or one Spirite, or one fourme: but that onely whiche wee termed beefore, ſimple and continuall, as euery one of vs, for example.

                  They are of ſundrie kindes. For ſome bee integral, which are the partes conſtituting the whole world, whiche wee terme ſubſtanciall: otherſome diſtinguiſhing it onely, and limited by reaſon of certeine vſes, and commodities.

                  There are briefly twayne, for the moſt part propoſed by the Scripture, to wit, the heauen and earth: as it

appeareth to the Coloſsians the 1. chapter and 16. verſe: and Geneſis the 1. chap. and 2. verſe: and Iſay the 1. chap. and 1. verſe, and in other places almoſt infinite: although in Geneſis the 49. cha. and 25. verſe, heauen and the deapthes bee alſo reckned.

                  M.
                  All that region of this world, whiche is called by the Philoſophers Ethereall, and conteineth the celeſtiall and vnengendred bodies, which continue, and are not chaunged ſince the firſt day of their creation, as ſayth S. Peter, 2. of Peter, the 3. chapter, and 4. verſe.

                  M.
                  Not onelye this bodye, and element whiche wee properly call the earth, but alſo that whole region of this world, whiche by the Philoſophers is termed Elementare, which conteineth in it ſuch bodies as are engendred, and are continually ſubiect to alteration.
               
               
                  S.
                  Doe theſe twoo regions differ?
               
               
                  M.
                  Yea, very much both in name and effect. In name, for that the firſt is called heauen, and this latter parte of the worlde is tearmed by the name of the elementes, yea and that by the ſcripture. For S. Peter in the 2. Epiſtle, the 3. Chapter, the 10. and 14. verſes, diſtinguiſheth theſe words, Heauen, and y• Elementes. In effect, for that this endureth and continueth in the old ſtate: the other is dayly chaunged, and at one time is engendred, and at an other tyme periſheth. The firſt, God hath reſerued to himſelfe, the other hee hath giuen to the vſe of man: Pſalme 115. and 16. verſe. The firſt, as wee are taught, ſhall periſhe at the latter day but with ſinale noyſe, and a lyght flaſhe of flame, for

that it conſiſteth of a fine and ſubtill nature: but the other ſhall burne with great heat, and bee diſſolued with mightie rage of fyre, eeuen in ſuch ſorte, as looke how it hapeneth in our earthly & material fire whē it flameth, the ſtickes crack, & ſmoke, & ſende foorth a vapour, which proceedeth from the moyſt partes therof: ſo it is ſaide that the elementes ſhall glowe with heat, and melt, for that they are of an hard, thick and clammie nature, and not pure and cleane. This difference alſo may bee obſerued betwene the two partes of the worlde, that the thinges which are in the firſt, are the efficient & principall cauſes, of thoſe thinges that are engendred in ye other. But the thinges that are in the ſecond & elemētare part of the world, are the materiall cauſes of thoſe thinges whiche are heare engendred. Wherefore they be in the things, & doe conſtitute and make their ſubſtance: which vſe and functiō ye woord, element, when it is properly taken doth ſignifie.

                  I will nowe touche them in fewe woordes, and at an other tyme perhapes declare them more at large. Some determine the ethereall and heauenly region, from the higheſt heauen vnto the circle of the Moone. And the elementare, from that place whiche is vnder this circle & ſphere, vnto the loweſt center of the earth. Howbeit, otherſome ſuppoſe rather, that the Moone belongeth to the elementare and earthly region of the woorlde: concerning which varictie of mens opiniōs, reade Plutarches booke of the face whiche appeareth in the globe of the Moone. Howbeit, I haue alwayes thought the firſt opinion to bee trueſt.

                  What thincke you then, of that generall diuiſion of thinges, whereby all thinges that are in this worlde are diuided, not into two partes, but into foure generall kindes, to wit, of thinges that are in heauen, vppon the earth, vnder the earth, and in the ſea, as it is to bee ſeene in the Reuelat. the 5. chapter and 13. verſe? And Sainct Paule likewiſe, hath plainly diſtinguiſhed three kindes of things to wit, of heauen, of the earth, and of vnder the earth: To the Philip. the 2. chapter, and 20. verſe.

                  Thoſe generall diuiſiōs of things wherof you ſpake, and whatſoeuer other there bee, may eaſily bee reuoked vnto theſe two generall kindes of thinges which I propoſed. For that which is called the earthly and elementare Region, comprehendeth all thinges that are vpon the earth, and in the earth, & in the waters: yea, thoſe things alſo that are called things vnder the earth: whiche for the moſt part are none other in the Scripture, than the things that are in the ſea, as it apeareth by the interpretatiō which God himſelf made in the 20. chap. of Exodus, and 4. verſe. And the ethereall region conteineth all things that are called heauenly.
               
            
            
               
                  The xxix. Chapter. Of the Eaſt, Weſt, North, and South partes of the worlde.

                     DIſcourſe now of that kinde of partes, whi che you termed diſtinguiſhing, and not conſtituting partes of the worlde.

                  Theſe bee foure in number, called thus in the Hebrue tongue. Quedem, Iamin, Tſaphon, Negeb, or Iamita: and amonge vs thus: Eaſt, Weſt, North, and South, all whiche Sainet Auguſtine thinketh to bee

comprehended, and ſignified by this woorde Adam: applying the Hebrue woorde to the Greeke.
               
               
                  S.
                  But what was the cauſe and reaſon of fyrſt deuiſing theſe names?
               
               
                  M.
                  It is not needefull to ſeeke out the cauſes and reaſōs of the Greeke and Latine woords, For they are commonly knowne. And as for the Hebrue woords, this I thinke, is the reaſon of them. The Eaſt is called Quedem, bicauſe it is the firſte or foremoſt parte of the worlde. The weſt Iamin, which ſignifieth the ſea, bycauſe in the Weſt part of the worlde lieth ye great ſea which is called Mare Mediteraneum, the midlande ſea. The North Tſaphon, for that, that part of the worlde was hid and vnknowne to the Hebrues, in reſpect of the regions of the earth, and of the people with whō they had no trafycque nor dealinge, bicauſe of the diſtance of place beetweene them. So that the caſe ſtoode contrarie with them and vs nowe, who dayly beholde the North ſtare and poale. And as for the South, it is alwaies hidden from vs. The South is called by them Negeb, bycauſe that quarter of the worlde is drie barrein, and burnt with the perpetuall heate and ſkorching of the Sunne: or it may bee called Iamin the firſte ſillable beeing long, that thereby it may differ from the fyrſt Iamin, whiche hath the fyrſte ſyllable ſhorte, bycauſe that when wee looke into the Eaſt. y• South is on our right hand, & not on our left.

                  This diſtinction of the quarters of the worlde was neceſſarie for the vſe of man, for two cauſes. The firſt to the ende that the nations and people of this world might be diſtinguiſhed one frō another: wherof we ſay ſome dwel Eaſt, ſome weſt, ſome north, & ſome ſouth. Moreouer, to obſerue the courſe of the Sūne (whoſe benefit al nations do enioye) who riſing in ye Eaſt, goeth by ye ſouth, vntill at length he cōmeth into ye Weſt. And finally, to declare the force & originall of the windes: all which cannot poſſibly bee vnderſtood and obſerued, vnleſſe theſe foure quarters of the worlde bee diſtinguiſhed. And as touching priuat vſe alſo, it was neceſſarie that they ſhould bee diſtinct. Firſt, to the entent that the limites and ſituation of euery kingdom, people, and countrie, may be diſcribed. And alſo that it might bee ſignified and ſet foorth, where the boundes and endes are of the houſes, fendes and places of euery territorie, and ſo thereby in the ende all ſtrife and contention bee taken from among priuate men, concerning the boundes of their landes.
               
               
                  S.
                  I vnderſtād what you ſay. But what are theſe regiōs diſtinct by nature, or rather are they fantaſied by the

opiniō of men, ſo yt euerie priuate people, or man, may whereſoeuer hee will, make Eaſt, Weſt, North and South? For that region of heauen and earth which is called by the Hebrues Tſaphon, that is to ſay, hidden, and by vs the North: the ſame is oftentimes vnto vs wide, playne and open to bee ſeen, like as that region of Heauen whiche was vnknowen too the Jewes, is vnto all the Northren people. And contrariwiſe, the Southren Region of Heauen, and the Poale of the worlde whiche was ſeen of them, is hidden from vs as is alſo the Starre called Canopus, with ſuche other. Moreouer, that parte of the worlde whiche is on the right hand to vs, is oftentimes on the lefte hand to others. whereof came that whiche Virgill ſpake of the Articke Poale:
                  
                     This top ouer our heades aloft remaineth ſtill in fight:
                     The other black Styx ſeeth below, and ghoſtes that dwell in night.
                  
                  And that ſaying alſo of the Poet Lucane:
                  
                  
                     Arabians, you now are come into a ſtrangie land,
                     Much woundring not to ſee thee ſhadowes fall on your left hand:
                  
                  with other ſuche like to that purport.
               
               
                  M.
                  No truely. For theſe quarters of the world bee by nature determined, foraſmuche as it can not bee Eaſte but where the Sunne riſeth: neither Weſt, but where hee goeth downe. Neither North, or South bee appointed, but in plaine contrarie partes of the worlde: the Northe, where the Northren people dwell, and South in the contrarie part. And although wee doc here vſe theſe woordes, the riſing and ſetting of the Sunne, generally and ſtrictly, and not for anie one preciſe part or point in heauen (for the Sunne riſeth mone place in the Winter, & in another in y• Spring,

and in another in Summer) notwithſtanding hee riſeth alwaies in one certein place of the world, neither doth he paſſe y• determinate bounds which the Lorde hath appointed vnto hym, too keepe his courſe in throughout the whole yere. Wherefore, this diſtinction of the partes of the world, conſiſteth not in the opinion of men, or at euerie mans pleaſure, but is defined and limited by nature, true ſeparation, and experience.

                  M.
                  Thei are in number ſixe. and thei are taken from thoſe three dimenſions, whiche properly beelong vnto bodies. To wit, high, lowe, beefore, beehinde, on the right hande, on the left.
               
               
                  S.
                  How ſo?
               
               
                  M.
                  For that is proper vnto euery naturall bodie too bee long, broad, deepe or thicke. As for thoſe deliniations whiche are plaine and flat, thei are not bodies, but ſuperficies, that is to ſaie, vppermoſte faces: and therefore one of thoſe three dimenſions is noted and taken by a right line. But there bee twoo extreme partes or endes of euery ſtreight line. Wherefore there bee ſixe extreame partes or endes of thoſe three dimenſions or ſtreight lines, whiche doe diſtinguiſhe and make ſo many ſundrie differences of place or ſituation. And in lengthe, wee terme one ende highe, another lowe. In breadth, wee place thoſe, on the right hande, and on the lefte hande. In deapthe or thickneſſe, beefore, and

beehinde. Howbeeit theſe twoo latter differences can not bee obſerued in euery kinde of bodie, but onely in that whiche is called the bodie of a liuyng Creature, and is endued with ſenſe.
               
               
                  S.
                  How commeth this about, that you recken onely thre dimenſions of a bodie, and S. Paule reciteth fower, to wit, length, breadth, height and deapth: to the Epheſians the 3. chapter, and 18. verſe: likewiſe in Iob the 11. chapiter, and 8. and 9. verſes, the ſame are recited.
               
               
                  M.
                  You ſaie truely. Howbeeit theſe twoo, deapthe and heighth, are indeede, and ſubiect all one, and in reaſon onely diſtinguiſhed.

                  Like as it is the very ſame waie, ſaith Aristotl

                        , which leadeth from Athenes to Thebes, and from Thebes to Athenes: and like as in one and the ſelf ſame ladder and ſtaiers, indeede and in reſpecte of the ſubiecte, the goyng vp, and the goyng doune is all one: the goyng vp, if a man climbe from the loweſt ſtep to the higſteſt: the goyng doune, if hee deſcende from the higheſt ſtep too the loweſt. So in verie deede are highth and deapth: but it is then called highth, when a man looketh vp from the loweſt to the higheſt: and deapth when hee looketh doune from the top to the bottome, ſo that we vſe but one kinde for bothe theſe dimenſiōs. And thus it commeth to paſſe, that there bee onely ſixe differences of place, and not eight.

                  Uerely, if I ſhould ſtande to declare, how diuerſe the opinions of men bee, touchyng this poincte onely▪ I

ſhould not onely bee weariſome, but alſo farre paſſe the boundes of mine argument, whiche I haue taken in hande. For Aſtronomers doe otherwiſe, and in other places appointe them, and Southſaiers otherwiſe, and Hiſtoricians otherwiſe. To bee ſhort, eeuen in that verie pointe, ſundrie nations are of ſundrie opinions: as for example the Egiptians, who will haue the Eaſt to bee the forepart of the worlde: the Weſt the hinder parte: The North, the right ſide: and the South the left, as Plutarche writeth in Iſide, contrarie vntoo that whiche Nature, and common courſe of all thynges doeth admit. The Eaſte is the right ſide of the worlde, ſaieth Aristotle, and the Weſte the lefte: for the worlde mooueth eeuen like a man that beeginneth at the right hande to ſet forthe vpon his iourney, on whoſe right ſide then is the Northe, and the South parte of the worlde on his lefte. Varro in his 6. booke de lingua Latina, is of an other opiniō, to wit, that the Eaſt is on the lefte hande, the Weſte on the right, the Southe right beefore, and the Northe beehinde. But the Scripture ſaieth otherwiſe.

                  It conſtantly calleth the Eaſte the fore parte of the world: the Weſt, the hinder: the South the right ſide: and the North the left.

                  M.
                  Firſt, out of that place of Iob, whiche is in the 23. chapiter, 8. and 9. verſes: and bicauſe it followeth neceſſarily, that if you make the Eaſt the foremoſte part of the worlde, that then the Northe multe bee on the left hande: and the South on the right it plainly appeareth vnto him, whoſoeuer ſhall looke into ye Eaſt.

And likewiſe Dioniſius. Halicarnaſseus teacheth, that the ſame is neceſſarily gathered.
               
               
                  S.
                  Why doeth the Scripture make the Eaſte to bee the face and foremoſte part of the worlde?
               
               
                  M.
                  Bicauſe, like as our ſenſes, ſpecially our eyes and countenance, are placed in the face and foremoſte part of the man: ſo dooeth the light firſt riſe vnto vs from that part of the worlde. Whereby it commeth to paſſe, that al men turne their countenances thither: yea the brute beaſtes alſo of the fielde, who in the mornynges as thei feede in the Medowes, doe turne themſelues towardes the riſyng of the Sunne, for light. Thus, by verie inſtinct of Nature, all thynges doe acknowledge and confeſſe that this parte of the worlde, is as it were, the face, eyes, and fore part of the worlde.
               
               
                  S.
                  Me thinkes, that theſe thyngs in the worlde are diſtinguiſhed rather in reſpect of vs, than of Nature.
               
               
                  M.
                  Truely, the worlde is diſtinguiſhed indeede, ſpecially in reſpecte of vs. For in a circle properly, and of it ſelf, nothyng can bee ſaied to bee on the right hande, nothyng on the left, nothyng beefore, nothyng beehinde, foraſmuche as all partes of the circumference, in that kinde of figure, are equally placed. And therefore Arnobius ſaieth well in his 4. booke: The worlde of it owne nature, hath neither right hande, neither left: neither high regions, neither lowe: neither beefore, neither beehinde. For whatſoeuer is roūd hath neither beginning, neither ending. And therfore when we ſay, this countrie is on the right hande, this on the left: we ſpeake it not in reſpecte of the worlde, but of the place where wee ourſelues are ſituate and dwel
                           •
                        yng. This farre Arnobius. Whereby it appeareth, how fooliſhe and without grounde that opinion of the auncient Hetruſcane Southſaiers is, who

iudged, that lefte hande lightnyng, lefte hand birde fliyng, lette hande ſignes of heauen, are of nature more fortunate, than thoſe whiche appeared in any other parte of the worlde. For that whiche is on the lefte hande to mee, maie bee on the right hande to you, becauſe theſe differences of place and ſituation, are chaunged by the diuerſe reſpecte and reaſon of men.

                  But tell mee, is it ſo of nature, or conſiſteth it onely in the opinion of men, that one parte of the worlde is high, and another lowe?
               
               
                  M.
                  Of nature ſurely: for thoſe thinges that are lyght do naturally tende vpwarde, and goe towardes heauen: and the thinges that are heauie downwarde, and towardes the earth. Moreouer, if we conſider the order of thinges, God hath thus appointed, that thoſe higher

thinges ſhall woorke vpoon theſe lower. For heauen woorketh vppon theſe earthly thinges, and wee perceiue the influences and effectes thereof diuerſely, and either it bringeth foorthe, or diſtroyeth manye things vpon the earth, as it were, with to much rain, or drought. Wherefore, Heauen, both by nature of the place, and alſo ſituation, is higher than the earth. Howbeit, concerning this poinet S. Auguſtine grauely diſputeth in the 83. booke, and 29. queſtion. For hee demaundeth this queſtion, whether in this vniuerſalitie and world, which is conteined within a circulare fourme, ſumthing may bee called high and ſumthing lowe, ſeeinge all the partes thereof conſiſt in equall ſituation.
               
               
                  M.
                  Concerning the circumferēce of a circle, perhaps this queſtion may bee demaunded, which indeed was S. Auguſtines meaning, whether the one part thereof bee high & an other lowe: for in truth, in reſpect of themſelues, thei are al of equall ſituatiō. But touching the thinges themſelues which are comprehended within the Circle, thys queſtion is cleere, and out of doubte. For in euery circle the circumferēce is the vpper part therof, & the centre the lower: vnto which parte thoſe thinges whiche come neereſt of loweſt: like as thoſe higheſt yt are neereſt to the circumference of the circle.
               
               
                  S.
                  Which is the middle parte of the worlde?
               
               
                  M.
                  The mideſt of the worlde may bee doubly conſidered, either in reſpect of ſubſtance, or of place. Whiche the great Philoſopher Plutarche firſt obſerued in his booke of the contrarietie of the Stoikes. The midds of the worlde in reſpect of ſubſtance is not ſome o
                        •

                        •••
                     e

partly of the nature of heauen, and partly of the earth. But the midds in reſpect of place, is the earth, as it is agreed vpon by thoſe that holde opinion, that the compaſſe and capableneſſe of the world is of a round and ſphericall figure. For, as they affirme, the earth ſtandeth in ſtead of a centre, in cōpariſon of the whole world. Touching which opinion, although they contende againſt it, which dency that there bee any Antipodes, or dwellers on the otherſide of the earth right againſt vs, as Lactantius and S. Auguſtine, good and allowed auctours haue doone: yet is it more true and credible that there are ſuch Antipodes, & the rather, for that there can bee nothing alleaged out of the Scriptures, to confyrme the auctoritie of Lactantius and S. Auguſtine by: and alſo reaſon plainely prooueth it to bee true, to wit, the ſituation of countries, and the eleuation of the Poales.

                     HEthertoo you haue declared the efficient, materiall, and formall cauſe of the world, it remaineth alſo that you ſay ſumwhat of the fourth, whiche is the finall cauſe: concernyng whiche I demaunde this queſtion of you, what is the finall cauſe of the creation of the worlde, as the ſcripture noteth?

                  You did well to adde that clauſe, as the Scripture noteth. For there is none among the Philoſophers, except onely Plato and Trimegiſtus, that, although they wounder

at the worlde, doeth declare notwithſtanding for what cauſe it was made, and what is the ende of the creating, or now ſubſiſting thereof. No not Ariſtotle himſelf, although hee wroate about 30. ſundry bookes more or leſſe, concerning the nature of thinges, which bookes are extant at this day, and toſſed in all mens handes.

                  Not onely for that Father Ireneus writeth ſo, in his 2, booke, and 64. chap. but bicauſe the ſpirite of God teacheth vs ſo. For firſte, the holy Scripture ſheweth plainlye, that all thinges were made for the glorie of the true GOD, who is reuealed vntoo vs in his woord: Prouerbes, the 16. chapter, and 16. verſe: and alſo S. Paule ſayeth in the 1. chapter to the Romanes, the 20. verſe, that the knowledge of GOD is learned out of theſe created and viſible thinges. For this world is a familiare, cōmon to all landes, people, & nations, a free and moſt beautifull looking glaſſe, wherin the power, wiſedome and goodnes of God is layed foorth before vs to bee ſeen, beeholden and acknowledged, as it is abundantly declared in the 29. Pſalme, the 1. 2. 3. 4. and 5. verſes: whereunto you may adde that whiche is written in the booke of wiſdome the 13. chapter, the 1. and 5, verſes. Hereof cummeth that ſaying of Iob, in the 36. chapter, and 29. verſe: Remember that thou doe magnifie hys woorke (hee meaneth Gods) whiche all men doe beehold and
                     
                     ſee, and man looketh vpon a farre of. And therefore Iſay in the 44. chapter, and 23. verſe, not onely inuiteth men, but all other creatures alſo to ſing prayſe vnto God. The like is alſo doone in the 147. Pſalme.

                  There are obiect vnto our eies ſo infinite and innumerable vertues, moreouer ſo noble and incomprehenſible excellencie and maieſtie, that the eternall deitie of the almightie God, doth truely and manifeſtly ſhewfoorth it ſelfe in the beeholding and ſurueiyng of this world, as S. Paule ſayeth. But that I may not runne through all, and that this diſputation may at length drawe to an end, wee will reuoke and contract the ende of this worlde into the klowledge of three ſpeciall vertues in God.

                  Firſt, the power of God appeareth wounderful great in creating this worlde, yea, plainely infinite, and far ſurmounting al capacitie and vnderſtāding of mans witte. In that God hath made all theſe things of nothing, ſo many in number, ſo big in Mo
                        •
                     e, and ſo wide in place. Which beeing all ſeuerally beholden and conſidered, doe argue great power and force in the maker: but beeing generally looked vpon, do declare that his power is incomprehenſible and infinite. Thys power of God in creating the world, is propoſed vnto

vs to bee acknowledged and thought vpon, namely in the 19. Pſalme, and alſo in the 145. And as for other places of the Scriptures and Prophetes, what ſhall I neede to goe about to recite them in this place?
               
               
                  S.
                  Giue mee an example of Gods wiſedome, in the creating and contemplation of the woorkmanſhip of this world.
               
               
                  M.
                  That may eaſely bee ſeene. Firſt, in that hee hath placed ſo many ſundrie and diuerſe partes, and ſo many ſeuerall kindes of thinges in one whole bodie: next, that hee hath giuen a peculiare and proper force and nature vnto euery kinde: Moreouer, that hee hath alotted to euery nature his owne proper place and metion: and to bee ſhort, that hee aſſigneth not onely vnto euery kind, but alſo vnto euery parte of euerie particulare thing, it owne proper vſe, ende, profit, and effect. So that, that great wiſedome of God hath not made, no not the leaſt thing in vaine, whiche is truely the manifold wiſedome, as S. Paule termeth it to the Epheſians the 3. chapter, and 10. verſe. And therefore it is ſaid in the 136. Pſalme: and 5. verſe, that hee made the heauens with vnſearchable vnderſtanding and wiſdome. And when as the Prophet Dauid conſidered in his minde deepely the framing of this world, hee cried out, and ſayd: Thy knowledge is to woonderfull and excellēt for mee, I can not attaine vnto it: Pſalme
                      139. and 6. verſe: wherevnto alſo that may bee added which is writen in the 39. chapter, and 26. verſe of Eccleſiaſticus. This our opinion alſo is confirmed in the 8. chapt. and 27. and 28. verſes, and the reſidue following: and alſo the 21. cha. and 30. verſe: and by this one thing moreouer, that whereas there bee certein thinges, yea, and men alſo,

that are of diuerſe and fundrie qualities and condicions, and of natures quite contrarie: they were to good purpoſe by the ſame wiſedom of God, created in ſuche maner. For the Lord hath wiſely, made a difference and diſtinction beetweene the ritchman and the poore: Prouerbes, the 22. chapter, and 2. verſe. To bee ſhort, thoſe thinges whiche wee make none accoumpt of, and are indeede but ſmall, as a Guat, a Woorme, and a Butterflie, in theſe notwithſtanding appeareth the wonderfull wiſedome of God, inſomuche as wee muſt needes acknowledge that to bee true which was ſpoken by Plinie an Heathen writer: Nature is neuer more whole in any thing then in the leaſt.

                     ame bee moſteuident in y• redemption of mankinde, whiche was accompliſhed by the death and paſſion of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt: notwithſtandyng it appeareth alſo vntoo vs to bee very excellent and incomprehenſible, in the creation, conſtitution, and cōſeruation of this world.

                  M.
                  Firſt, this is a great goodneſſe of God, that he would haue thinges to exiſt and bee, which were not beefore. Moreouer, in that hee gaue them lyfe and nature, to the intent they ſhoulde exiſt, whiche could not bee had from any other than him. Who onely is the fountayn of lyfe and afterward hath aſſigned vnto euery kinde of thing it owne proper & moſt conuenient foode, and and not aſſigned it once, but alſo prepareth, diſtributeth, and yeldeth it euery day. Finally, in that he dayly

preſerueth and defendeth all thinges that are: and beynge a good and mercifull father, of his owne greate bowntie hath not onely giuen them partes & members, wherby they may cōmodiouſly liue, but endewed them alſo with motion and ſenſe. Whereby they may paſſe their life pleaſantly, and willingly enioye it with a ſweete delight. All which it were infinite to recken. And therefore it is well and truely ſayd in the 33. Pſal. and 5. verſe, that the whole earth is full of his goodneſſe. And againe, in the 145. Pſal. and 7. verſe, it is ſayde, that the multitude of the goodneſſe of God, ſpringeth foorth from his workes: For hee openeth his hande, and ſatiſfied euery liuing thing vnto fullneſſe and pleaſure. Whervnto that ſeemeth to appertayne which is written in the 147. and 148. Pſal. and that may well bee concluded, which all the auncient & godly Fathers haue iudged & ſpecially Tertullian hath oftētimes written, to wit, That God by the creatinge of thys world, is cognized, and by the preaching of his woord is recognized.
                  
               
               
                  S.
                  But there appeare manye confuſions in this worlde, which doe obſcure the light of this goodnes, wiſedom and power of God.
               
               
                  M.
                  Indeede they darken them ſomewhat, and ſum while that they cannot plainely be ſeene of many: Howbeit they do not altogither obſcure, or wholy take awaie y• appearing of thoſe the vertues of God, which he hath imprinted in his woorkes. And moreouer, foraſmuch as theſe confuſions, as you terme them, are the effectes of his iuſt iudgement, if wee ſo conſider of them as wee ought, ſurely they ſhall the more ſet foorth the power, and wiſedome of God, and not obſcure it.

                  S.
                  
                     BUT that knowledge of God which maye bee hadde by beeholding the worlde, and the viſible creatures, is it ſufficient of it ſelfe to get the perfect vnderſtanding of him, or rather doeth it conteine and deliuer vnto vs certeine principles thereof which wee muſt more perfectly and at full afterward ſeeke and learne by ſome other meanes, to wit, out of the woorde of God which is written and reuealed vnto vs? For by the framinge and creation of the world wee cannot knowe that Chriſt is our Sauiour, and mediatour vnto God for vs.
               
               
                  M.
                  You ſaye well. For Sainct Paule aunſwereth in the Epiſtle to the Romanes, the 1. chapter, and 20. verſe, that although the knowledge which is had by the worlde, bee trewe, yet is it not fully ſufficient, that thereby wee may vnderſtande anye thing concerning our ſaluation through Chriſt: but that it is in this reſpecte profitable, that therby wee are made vnaccuſable. For it teacheth vs that God is our Creatour, but it is not able to enfourme vs y• he is alſo our redeemer thorow Chriſte: For wee are not able to atteine to that knowledge without the preachinge of the Goſpell. Wherefore, wee muſt not begin with that knowledge of God, whereby wee vnderſtande that hee is our ſauiour, but rather that hee is our creatour, whereat wee muſt indeede beeginne, and conſequently proceed vnto better and higher things. For the Heathen people & Philoſophers, who chiefly folowed this knowledge of Naturall thinges, neyther perceiued they

the reaſon of mans ſaluation which is in Chriſt onely: neither were thei thēſelues ſaued, bicauſe they lacked faith. It profiteth notwithſtanding, and it mutch profiteth too, that wee ſeeke the true God, that hath created all theſe thinges: and when wee haue founde hym, that wee woorſhip hym and praye vnto hym, as farre as hee ſhall giue vs grace ſo to doe. This much at the leaſtwiſe hee wringeth from vs whether wee will or no: that he ought both to bee ſought and worſhipped, who hath firſt created, and now gouerneth al this world. Wherfore, if we neither ſeeke him, neither woorſhip hym, hee maketh vs vnexcuſable.
               
               
                  S.
                  But there bee many, that either haue not ſeene at all that way of finding out God: or when they were entred, haue not perceiued that glorie of God, whereof you ſpake: or elſe by how muche the more they haue profited in the knowledge of this world and naturall thinges, ſo muche the more ſecurely and boldly haue they diſpiſed God, like as in times paſt did the Epicurian Philoſophers, and at this day alſo to many doe.
               
               
                  M.
                  Theſe are the greate imperfections and vices of men, whiche you ſpeake of, and a ſharpe accuſation of the wonderfull frowardnes of mans nature, not the woorkmans fault, or want of the light of Gods glorie, whiche ſhineth moſt brightly in his woorkes. For that light ſhineth clearely enough in this world, and in ſutch ſorte as it cannot bee put out, and alſo is eaſily ſeene whoſo will lift vp his eyes vnto it, and looke vpon it. For God hath engrauen in the world greate and wonderfull tokens of his goodnes, power, and wiſedome: hee layeth alſo beefore our eyes moſt manifeſt teſtimonies, and documentes that may bee vnderſtoode,

yea by the moſt ignorant perſons. Whiche, whoſo doeth not ſee, let hym accuſe hym ſelfe, or his owne ſluggiſhnes, and not the hardnes of the booke which God hath ſayd before our eyes: or the difficultie of the ſtyle thereof: or the dimneſſe of the lookingglaſſe, whiche indeede wee haue a moſt bright one in the contemplation of this worlde. For the 19. Pſalme doth ſufficiently remooue this ſlaunder from God and his woorkmanſhip, ſaiyng, that hee hath founded his trueth in the heauens. Pſalme
                      89. and 3. verſe. Who hath diſtinguiſhed and depainted with liuely colours, the other argumentes and tokens of his praiſe in them, as it were, by a certein ingrauyng. Therefore, in that men of olde times haue not ſeene ſo manifeſt ſignes of God, neither ſee at this day, neither doe profit by them towardes the atteining of the knowledge of God, it commeth by meanes of their owne fault, who by reaſon of their ſinne haue loſt the true light of their myndes: whiche if it had continued in the firſte ſtate of it owne creation, truely then ſhould they haue ſeen theſe ſignes not obſcurely and fayntly, but acknowledged them plainly and perfectly, and confeſſed them too bee great and wonderfull.

                  If wee ſaye, that one thing may haue many images,

and that in ſundrie reſpectes, wee ſhall not graunt any abſurditie. So that, although theſe three bee called looking glaſſes, wherin God repreſenteth himfelf, yet thei be ſo called, in diuerſe reſpects, & with a large difference. The worlde is not called the image of God, which notwithſtanding, is verified of man, & Chriſte, for the world is onely the looking glaſſe of Gods vertues, as it is their ſubiect, that is to ſay, that wherein they do expreſſe and ſhew themſelues by ſundry meanes and effectes. And man is the image of God, and not onely the lookinge glaſſe of his power, but alſo of his nature after a manner, for man of all other creatures of the worlde commeth neereſt to the nature of God, and caried the very fourme of him in the light of his minde and the vprightnes of his will, which was in him at his firſt creation. But Chriſt who is God manifeſted in the fleſhe, who was without ſinne, in whome the Godhead remained, who in his whole life and by al meanes ſhewed foorth the nature, ſimilitude & fygure of God through his great power, wiſedome, and clemencie, is in a farre more excellent reſpect the image of God than was the firſt man, althoughe hee were ſounde and perfect. Wherefore, the world hath no ſuch ſimilitude and likelineſſe with Chriſt, who is vnto vs not onely the ymage, and as it were the ſhadow of the goodneſſe, Wiſedome, and Power of God, but alſo the moſt bright, and ſelfeſame repreſentation of the fathers ſubſtance: Hebrues the 1. chapter and 3. verſe. And therefore hee is not called onely the image, but alſo the liuely brightneſſe of the Fathers glorye. And yet farther to the intent it may bee the better vnderſtoode, what, and how great the difference is wee

muſt note, that the world and man are a notable, but yet a ſhadowed repreſentation of thoſe things which they do teach vs, cōcerning god. And Chriſt ye expreſſe and liuely fourme, in whoſe inward, natural, and ſubſtanciall brightneſſe, wee may moſt euidently behold the infinite power of God, and incomprehenſible loue towardes vs men. Thus therefore, when wee thincke vppon God and beholde him in all other thinges, ſuche is our vanitie, that immediatly wee decay and come to naught: but when wee looke vppon him in Chriſt, wee are quieted and ſtayed moſt firmely and ſubſtantially. Wherefore there ought no compariſon bee made betweene theſe, which differ in kinde, and manner of repreſentation.

                  The firſt is this, to wit, the vſe of al men. For this worlde was created for mans ſake, and man for GOD. The ſeconde is, for the Church or congregation. For the worlde was created to the entent it ſhould bee an houſe and dwelling place prepared for the Church and congregation that ſhould bee hereafter where in it might remaine of it owne right, which congregation God woulde eſtabliſhe there, and afterward bring to heauen.

                     HEtherto you haue declared the cauſes of this worlde, nowe ſhewe the meanes and inſtrumentes wherby it was created. And when mention is made of the creation of the woorlde ſome do demaunde what wedges, what tooles and engins were occupied to the rearinge vp of ſo great a mole, and they thinke themſelues not ſatiſfied vnleſſe aunſwere bee made vnto thoſe doubtes of their minde.

                  Thei that ſeeke to know with what inſtruments this worlde was created, do verie foolyſhly, foraſmuch as this woorde, create, doth ſufficiently declare, that all this whole woorke is plainly miraculous, and ſupernaturall. For God vſed no tooles nor engins as carpenters vſe to doe, thereby to ſupplie the infirmitie of their ſtrength. But all his framing and buildinge, and the woorkemanſhip of thys worlde, doeth differ farre from all our meanes, and pollices.
               
               
                  S.

                  M.
                  In declaringe the meanes by which this world was created, ther are foure things annexed, which we muſt not pretermit, and they perteine to the ſettinge foorth

of Gods glory and omnipotencie: wherof the fyrſt is this, that the worlde was created at the woorde and commaundement of God.
               
               
                  S.
                  Howe prooue you that?
               
               
                  M.
                  Behold a moſt manifeſt place of the Scripture, in the 33. Pſalme. 9. verſe, For hee ſpake and it was doone, hee commaunded and it ſtoode faſt: and in the 148. Pſalme and 5. verſe: Hee commaunded and they were created. Moreouer Moſes in the firſt chapter of Geneſis beefore the creation of euery thing, as they were made and created orderly in euery daye, ſo doeth hee plainely ſhewe, that the woord and cōmaundement of God went alwayes before: And the Lorde ſayde, let it bee made, &c. Yea, the Stoikes haue ſaide that the woorde of God was the efficient cauſe of the whole nature of thinges, as Laertius writeth in his 7. booke in the life of Zeno.
                  
               
               
                  S.
                  But there bee twoo impedementes that it can not bee ſo.
               
               
                  M.
                  Which bee they?
               
               
                  S.
                  The fyrſt is that which is written in the 45. Chapter and 12. verſe of Iſay: My handes haue ſtretched foorth the heauens. Ergo,God made not theſe things with his woord, but with his handes.
               
               
                  M.
                  Uerily, this ſaiyng conteineth a moſt manifeſt Metaphore, when hee attributeth handes vnto God and when in reſpect of the weakeneſſe of our vnderſtanding. God is cōpared to an handie craftes man which woorketh with his owne hāds, the like wherof there are many authorities to be foūde in y• ſcriptures. And whereas this woorde of creating is vſed in the ſame place, it plainly calleth vs backe vnto that diuine and extraordinarie woorke of God, and to thinke vppon

that meane onely which Moſes hath recited.
               
               
                  M.
                  The ſeconde impediment is, that wheras in another place in like kind of thinges, and ſemblable argument mention is made of the woorde of God, notwithſtanding Gods ſecret will is ment thereby, whiche is not expreſſed in any woord, or commaundemēt, as in the 147. Pſalme 15. and 18. verſes, where he ſpeaketh of Ice: Hee ſendeth out his woorde, and melteth it.
                  
               
               
                  M.
                  You ſay well. Howbeit in Geneſis, the verye text, & alſo Moſes minde teatheth vs, that wee muſt ſay and thinke otherwiſe, where it is plainly writen that God ſpake and cōmaunded that to bee which was made. Wherfore the only bare and ſecrete will of God is not there to bee vnderſtood and taken, but that which is reuealed by the prolation and vtteringe of ſome woorde of his, and commaundement. Which opinion of mine is confirmed by an interpretation which the Scripture it ſelf maketh, noting yt this was doone by vttering of ſome woorde or voyce. For in the 33. Pſalme, and 6. verſe, after that it is declared that theſe things were made by the woorde of God, for true expoſition ſake it is added: & by the ſpirite of his mouth. For a voice is made by the breathing foorth of aire, which is doone by the mouth.
               
               
                  S.
                  But by this meanes, feigning that God hath a tōgue, roofe of the mouth, and teeth, with out whiche inſtruments no voyce can bee vttered, you ſeeme to reuoke againe out of Hell the abominable errour of the Antropomorphites.
                  
               
               
                  M.
                  God forbid that I ſhould thinke ſo wickedly of the infinite and omnipotent maieſtie of God. But like as the Lorde ſpake ſo as he might bee heard and vnderſtoode

when hee gaue the law in mount Sinai, which no man can deney: as likewiſe when hee ſpake to Moſes, & whē he gaue anſwere by Vrim & Thumim, y• Lord ſpake & vttered a voice in the hearing of the people, & yet not withſtāding we muſt not feigne y• god hath a tongue, a mouth, a palate of the mouth, & teeth. So, in the beginning & creation of the world, when it is ſayd that God ſpake, his diuine ſhape was not chaunged intoo an humane fourme: but it came to paſſe by a ſpeciall prouidence and pollicie. For the Lord tooke vpon him for a tyme ſuche meanes as were neceſſarie for the bringing foorth a cleare and audible voice, wherof afterward hee left the vſe.
               
               
                  .S
                  Doe you thinke then that the Lord ſpake plainly and diſtinctly?.
               
               
                  M.
                  Yea verely. Howbeeit I am not ignorant what S. Auguſtine thinketh concerning this matter, in the 1. booke of Geneſis ad literam, and 9. chapter.
               
               
                  S.
                  But theſe things are referred to the Sunne, when it is ſayd that the Lord created all thing by his woord, ſo that Chriſte is ment by the woorde, for by him all thinges were made. Coloſſ. the 1. chapter, and 16. verſe.
               
               
                  M.
                  I will not much contende herein, ſo that they will graunt mee, that as the Sunne is called the woorde ſo likewiſe that woorde was a ſigne and token of his preſence, power, and perſon, and alſo of his woorking. Whiche doeth likewiſe diſtinguiſhe the Father from, the Sunne.
               
               
                  S.
                  Why did God ſpeake, & commaund them to be made?
               
               
                  M.
                  Hee commaunded, to the intent that the thinges that were afterward made, might be knowne not to haue bin made by the Water, or Earth out of whiche they

came, or the heauens, or, to bee ſhort, by the vertue or power of any creature▪ but by the commaundement of the Lord onely, and the power of his woord. Wherfore, let vs giue prayſe vnto hym for all thinges that are created. And he ſpake, not that hee could not haue fourmed all thinges by the vertue and decree of his alonely will, who hadde already made Heauen and Earth without ſpeaking of any word: but when as it pleaſed God to reueale & manifeſt himſelf outwardly by his works, hee vſed thoſe meanes wherby hee willeth and commaundeth himſelfe to bee moſt certeinly knowne, to wit, his woorde & voice. The ſumme and ſcope of this word, is Chriſt, y• euerlaſting Sūne of y• euerlaſtīg father, who was afterward manifeſted in y• fleſh: & therfore hereof they do rightly gather, y• Chriſt the Sunne of God, did woorke in the creation of the world. For ther is a threefold meane, & booke, wherby God reuealeth himſelf vnto vs, to wit, the booke of creatures, y• boke of ſcripture, & the boke of life. That which is called y• booke of ſcripture, is far more ſure, true, and plentifull thā the other two, & therfore God doth eſpecially propoſe and commende the ſame vnto vs. And finally, to confirme myne opinion, I alledge that whiche Ireneus ſayeth, That God created all thyng with his word, that is to ſaye, with his voice, in his ſeconde booke, and 5. chapter: and that alſo whiche is written by Tertullian in his 4. booke againſte the Marciomtes in theſe woordes: Is it altogether incredible, how the power of the creatour ſhould procure the remedie of one tranſgreſſion with his woord, who by his word hath brought foorth ſo great a mole of the world? In whiche ſaiyng, doubtleſſe the woord, is taken for the voice: and in the 1. chapter, and 3. verſe of

the Epiſtle too the Hebrues, the Scripture vſeth the woord 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     .
               
            
            
               
                  The. xxxv. Chapter. Of the light, which was vſed at the creation of the world.
               
                  S.
                  
                     WHat ſay you, is ſecondly to be obſerued and conſidered of in declaring the creation?
               
               
                  M.
                  The light. For God made that as a neceſſarie thyng for the creatyng of his other woorkes.
               
               
                  S.
                  Whyſo.
               
               
                  M.
                  Both that by appliyng, as it were, a Candle or other light, that confuſed mole might bee ſeen, and diuided into meete partes and members: and alſo bicauſe it was neceſſarie that ſome firie qualitie ſhould bee applied vnto that moyſte matter, too warme it, and to make it frutefull. For all thinges that are in this inferiour world, are engendred by a firie heate, as it were by a warme and woorking father. And therefore that firſt light was created, to bee the continuall and common Nurſe, and moother, and fountaine of the externall and accidentall liuely heate, whiche God prepared as an inſtrument to bring foorth all other things withall. Not that God was not able to ſee all things that were in ye greate mole, who at this preſent beholdeth the moſt ſecret thinges, and obſcureſt darkeneſſe, and from whom there is nothing hid: not alſo that he needed that kind of meane, who of himſelf is Almightie: but to the intent we might vnderſtand how great wiſedome it was that created theſe viſible things, and what ſecond cauſes of them hee appointed firſt, which

now wee doe behold to woorke in them. And finally, how in the making of theſe viſible thinges, hee vſed moſte conueniently other thinges of the ſame kinde, which at this day are the naturall, and inſtrumentall, and chief, and principall cauſes of the engendryng of all thinges. For there are three thinges of them, too wit, moiſt earth, and that ſhining, bright, and liuely heate, which is appliable and conuenient for all thinges, in that all thinges haue that naturall heate in them. This is therefore, the ſecond thing whiche I ſuppoſe needfull to bee conſidered in the meanes and maner of creating the world.
               
            
            
               
                  ¶ The. xxxvi. Chapter. That God made this worlde without any payne or weariſomeneſſe vnto him.
               
                  S.
                  
                     WHat do you thirdly conſider?
               
               
                  M.
                  This forſooth, that GOD framed this ſo greate and huge a Mole of the worlde, without anye payne or wearyſomneſſe at all: that the Epicures neede not to feare leaſte wee aſcribe any greife and paine vnto God, in that men are not able to finiſhe the leaſt woorke that they haue to doe, without ſome trauayle and wearineſſe of bodye. And therefore it plainely appeareth hereby, howe greate the omnipotencie of God is, aboue the ſtrēgth of man. This which I ſay, is cōfirmed by Iſay in the 40. chapt. and 28. verſe: and likewiſe by S. Auguſtine in hys 4. booke de Geneſi ad Literam, and 8. chapter. In ſomuch that it is ſayde, that all thinges that were created, were ſuddeinly brought foorthe, and appeared, as it

were, in the twinckling of an eye, Pſalme 33. & 9. chap. and Eſdras the 4. booke the 6. chapter, and 48. verſe: for nothing coulde withſtande the pleaſure and cōmaundement of God.
               
            
            
               
                  The xxxvii. Chapter. The worlde was created by partes, and not all at once.

                     WHat thinke you fourthly to bee obſerued?
               
               
                  M.
                  That this whole worlde was made by partes, and in ſix dayes, as Moſes teacheth in the 1. chapter of Geneſis: & as it appeareth alſo in the 4. booke of Eſdras the 44. Chapter, and the nexte folowinge: and not made altogither at one inſtante. And to the entente it may bee the better borne in memorie, what was made vppon euery daye, I my ſelfe made theſe verſes folowing.
                  
                     The firſt day made both heauen and earth, & pleaſant glittring light
                     The ſeconde ſtreached out the ſpace beetweene the waters quite▪
                     
                     The thirde diuided Sea from Lande: and clad the earth with greene.
                     The fourth created Sunne & Moone, & ſtarres that bright do ſheene
                     The fifth brought foorth all feathered ſoules, and fiſhes of the lake.
                     The ſixt made Cattell in the fieldes, then man the Lorde did make,
                     And after worke the ſeauenth to reſt, himſelfe hee did betake.
                  
               
               
                  S.
                  But why did not god create al things togither in one day, ſeeing hee is almightie?
               
               
                  M.
                  Bicauſe hee is almightie, hee needed not time for the eſtabliſhing of this worlde, as Sainct Ambroſe ſaith

in his 39. Epiſtle: neither came it to paſſe by reaſon of impotēcie, wearines, or weakeneſſe in God, yt he was ſix dayes in making it: but bicauſe he is moſt wiſe, by moſt wiſe & good reaſō he would thus finiſh his workes. For whatſoeuer is made, requireth ſome order in the making. And order requireth diſtinct time, and number. Firſt therfore, god putteth vs in minde hereby, that hee wrought not confuſedly, nor out of order: and ſo conſequently, that wee muſt not meditate and thinke vpon his works lightly, and as it were a farre of in general: but in order, ſeuerally, and particularly of euery one. Hee ſheweth moreouer, howe great diligence wee ought to vſe in conſidering of them, ſeing that hee declareth that hee pauſed vppon the order of his woorks, by this diſtinctiō of the daies & labours. Beeſides this, hee declareth that wee are not able ſufficiently to comprehend his workes: the reaſon therof, and manner of creating them is ſuch, and ſo generall, that wee haue ſufficient matter in them to thinke vpon and beeholde euery daye in the weeke, and ſo throughout the whole yeare. For what other thinge is a yeare, than a continuall repeating of one, and the ſelfe ſame weeke? For there was an whole day ſpent in the finiſhinge of euery part and worke. Moreouer, god wold not creat ye world at once, but by piece meale that is to ſay, in ſome ſpace of time, for he ment immediatly after ye creatiō of the world, to declare the ſtate, law, & naturall order which the things that hee had made ſhould afterward folow, to wit, that, by which all thinges doe require a ſpace of time for their beeing, that is to ſaye, are brought foorth in tyme: and are not perfectly growne in a moment, as wee ſee dayely.

So thoſe thinges that growe out of the earth, doe at this daye keepe this order, that they ſpringe not ſuddeynly, but by proceſſe of time. So the woman is delyuered of hir child, after a certaine ſeaſon: ſo ſeedes growe out of the earth: ſo trees bringe foorth their frutes: and there is nothing done ſuddenly, but wonderfull miraculouſly. Wherfore, that time of creation, was the fyrſt lawe of thinges that ſhoulde afterward growe and bee ingendred.

                  And why did God at length, ceaſe the ſeauenth day?
               
               
                  M.
                  Bicauſe he would haue it ſo: for there can be no truer reaſon alleaged. For in that hee would haue it ſo, the reaſon is good, although to vs it bee vnknowne. For as touching thoſe thinges whiche are diſputed by S. Ambroſe im his 39. Epiſtle: and alſo by S.

                  The. xxxviii. chapter. Of the place wherein the world was made.
               
                  S.
                  
                     HEtherto you haue declared what y• worlde is, what is the cauſe therof, and what was the maner of making it. Adde hereunto alſo that which may bee demaunded concernyng the place, tyme, and ſtate of this created world, ſo that at length wee may conclude this whole diſputation.
               
               
                  M.
                  I will doe ſo: if you aſke mee of them all in order.
               
               
                  
                  S.
                  Firſte therefore, I demaunde concerning the place wherin the worlde is made, what it was, and what maner one it was?
               
               
                  M.
                  It muſt needes bee, that it was ſome voyde place, whiche the Grecians call Kenos, & the Hebrues Tohu, wherin it ſhould be created, and placed.
               
               
                  S.
                  Why ſo?
               
               
                  M.
                  For bicauſe if the place wherein the worlde, beeyng ſo greate a frame, was placed, had bin already full of bodies, there could not bee another body placed in a roomth that was full alreadie. For twoo bodies cannot bee togither in one place. Moreouer, this whiche I ſay, is plainly confirmed. The Hebrues ſay out of the 26. chapter of Iob, and 7. verſe: He ſtretched foorth the North vpon the void place, &c. Although that before this worlde was made, GOD occupied that place wherein the world now ſtandeth, & filled it with his power which is vnknowne to vs, and in an vnſpeakable maner: as now alſo hee filleth althinges after they bee made by the vertue and meanes of his preſence, maieſtie, and power: whereof God is called Megonah, that is to ſay, that filleth all thinges: Deuteron. the 33. chapter, and 27. verſe: notwithſtanding in reſpect of this filling, which cummeth by the creation of thinges, verily the place wherin this world now ſtandeth, was a certein voyd place.
               
               
                  S.
                  How then, will you haue that there ſhalbee ſome void place in the world, againſt whiche thing Ariſtotle contendeth ſo mutch, and experience alſo?
               
               
                  M.
                  To the ende that I may cut of all occaſion of the vain errours of the Valentines, concernyng Bythus, whom Ireneus aboundantly confuteth in his 2. booke, and 4. and

7. chapters, thus I ſay: That beefore the world was made, the place and ſpace wherein it nowe ſtandeth, was voyde: but ſince the worlde was made, that it is not voyd now, but full.
               
               
                  S.
                  But doe you leaue nowe any voide place, within the compaſſe of the worlde?
               
               
                  M.
                  Uerily if you call that onely ful, that is filled with this aire whiche wee drawe in and breath foorth, there bee many places too bee called voyd, For all that ſpace of the worlde. whiche is aboue the Circle of the Moone (which ſome ſay is very large) is void. But if you call that full, whiche is repleniſhed with ſome bodie and nature of it owne kinde, then maye I call no parte of this whole worlde voide, no not ſo muche as that whiche the Aſtronomers ſaye, is conteined within the Globe and ſpace of the Heauens: but all full, and occupied. Not onely bicauſe God made nothing in vain, for that is repugnant to his wiſedome, but alſo for that the whole ſtretching foorth of the heauens, howe big ſoeuer it be, is an heauenly body. For ther is now no effect, no vſe of a voide place in the nature of thinges, whiche is created: but there are ſeene daylie many, and moſt excellent vſes in this pointe, I meane in that nature will haue all thinge to bee full. And that indeede ther is nothing voyd and emptie, both the vſe of cupping glaſſes in Phyſicke, & alſo in the plucking vp of Welles and waters into high places by Pumpes, and other deuiſes, ſufficiently doe teache. Suche Philoſophers therfore, as contend that there is ſome void place in this world, are not onely thēſelues voide of wit and iudgment, but ſtriue alſo moſte manifeſtly againſt certeine experience, whom therefore I iudge

not too bee eſteemed of.
               
            
            
               
                  ¶ The. xxxix. Chapter. Of the tyme wherein the worlde was made.
               
                  S.
                  
                     YOU haue ſpoken of the place, ſpeake now alſo of the tyme, wherein this worlde was made.
               
               
                  M.
                  That this worlde beegan ſometyme to exiſte, and is not eternall, neither of like antiquitie with GOD, not onely the Maieſtie of Gods holie woorde doeth teſtifie, but alſo the opinions of the moſte auncient Philoſophers doe declare. Whoe, as thei were nerer too the beeginnyng of the worlde, ſo did thei learne the truthe more better of the Fathers, and reteined the ſame more freſhly in memorie. For yt 
                     Plato in Timeo was of that opinion, and all the Stoikes alſo, their owne writynges do beare witneſſe, yea, moreouer, this hath bin agreed vpon, by a generall conſent of the moſte auncient writers, that the worlde had a beginnyng, whereof Linus the eldeſt Poete of all, who liued before Orpheus, writyng of the creation of the worlde, beeginneth thus: A tyme there was when all thynges framed were togither once, as Diogenes Laertius reporteth.
               
               
                  S.
                  There bee twoo ſpeciall poinctes repugnant to your opinion, whereof the one is alledged by the Aristotelians, and the other by the Epicurians.
                  
               
               
                  M.
                  What bee thei?
               
               
                  S.
                  The firſt is this. Seeyng the worlde is rounde, and of a Sphericall fourme, there can neither beginnyng, nor endyng bee noted therein: whereby it commeth to paſſe, that when it mooueth it mooueth circularly or

rounde, whiche motion alſo hath neither beeginnyng nor endyng, but is a continuall and perpetuall motiō: and is therefore eternall. Now, if the worldes motiō bee eternall the worlde alſo muſt needes bee eternall. Thus the Peripatetikes by the figure and motion of the world, doe conclude y• the world it ſelf is alſo eternall.
               
               
                  M.
                  Truely this is a verie ſlender argumente. For firſte, who will graunt vnto them, that all the partes of the world doe mooue, by that circulare and ſphericall motion? ſeeyng that, as thei them ſelues doe write, neither, the fire, neither the aier, neither the water, neither the earth dooe mooue by this motion, but by a right line and a pendent: to wit, the fire and aire vpwarde: the water and earth dounewarde. Moreouer, if wee deale thus liberally with them, to graunte, that the worlde is of a ſphericall fourme and figure, who is able to prooue notwithſtandyng, that there can bee no beeginning of motion aſſigned, and obſcrued therein? Seeyng it is not mooued of it ſelf, but by an other, too wit the greate God, or, as thei terme it, by a certeine firſte intelligence, or Angell. And whereas it is ſaied of a wheele, of a ſphere, or of a circle, that the beginnyng of the motion there of cannot bee aſſigned in this poincte of the circumference more than in another, it is true onely in reſpecte of the thing & the figure, and not if you reſpect the hande that turneth it, or the forcyng of the cauſe that mooueth it, in reſpect whereof, the poinct is called the beeginnyng of moouyng in the ſphere or circle, where hee beginneth to mooue it firſt, that turneth the circle, ſphere, or wheele about. Wherfore, although the worlde can haue no beginnyng of moouyng, neither of it ſelf, neither of it owne figure:

notwithſtandyng it hath of God who once beegan it, and turned it from a certeine poincte of the circumference, and a certeine place, to wit, from the Eaſt, continually to mooue into the Weſte, whether it turneth now daiely, beeyng by hym mooued, and not of it ſelf. And although it bee vnknowne to vs nowe, whiche parte of the circumference of heauen God firſt moued (for you ſee how many, and diuerſe thynges men dooe affirme, concernyng the greate yeere of the worlde, whiche is that ſtate of the worlde, wherein Heauen and all thinges returne to their place, where thei wer firſt created) yet it is certein, that heauen began ſometyme to mooue, from ſome one prefixed poincte and part of the circumference.
               
               
                  S.
                  The other repugnancie is this. Thei ſaie it is to abſurde, to ſaie that God did not create this world from eternitie, and tyme euerlaſtyng. For after ſo many infinite ſpaces of yeres paſte, what ſhould moue hym at length, that hee would Create the worlde? Thei demaunde therefore, why GOD remained ſo long ſluggiſhe and idle, why hee ſlept ſo long, what he did then, why hee ceaſed from dooyng ſomethyng ſo long, why hee made not this noble and goodlie woorke ſooner? Theſe and ſuche like floutes, thei caſt foorthe againſt the maieſtie of God.
               
               
                  M.
                  You doe alleage the argument of Velleius the Epicure: vnto whiche I will anſwere that which, as S. Auguſtine writeth, was ſpoken by a certein mery old man, a Chriſtian. Who, beeyng likewiſe demaunded by ſuche kinde of men, what God did beefore hee created the worlde: anſwered: He made Hell, wherein hee might tormente perpetually ſuche curious fellowes, as doe demaunde ſuche
                     
                     queſtions. For what wickedneſſe is this, to go about to enter into ſuche ſecretes: what impudencie to creepe ſo farre? what blaſphemie, to looke that God ſhould rendre an accoumpt to vs of his doinges, and forepaſſed life, who muſt bee our iudge? what needed hee too haue created theſe thinges ſooner, whiche hee neither hath neede of too his exiſtence, neither thereby to liue in greater felicitie? For God hath in himſelf, and that from all eternitie, a moſt perfect, moſt happie, and moſt full ſtate of nature, whiche is vnto himſelfe ſufficient for all thinges, and he hath neede of none other thing, neither of Angell, nor man: Pſalme 16. and 2. ver. Neither was GOD then idle, that the Epicures maye not mock, neither did hee ſleepe in ſlouthfulnes beefore he made this world. But euen then, as alſo now, he was inwardly occupied in his woorkes, that is to ſay, hee was wonderfully delighted in the contemplation of hymſelf, hee enioyed then himſelf, and his perfect and vnſpeakeable glorie: hee was buſied in the moſt large and incomprehenſible light of his ſubſtance and eſſence, as may eaſily bee vnderſtoode out of the Prouerbes, the 8. chapter, and 30. verſe: and Iohn, the 17. chapt. and 4. verſe: and likewiſe out of Irenaeus, the 4. booke, and 28. chapter.

                  M.
                  Concerning the day, mee thinkes this much may bee ſayd, that the beginning and firſt daye of ye creation of the worlde, was that day which wee Chriſtians doe

nowe call Sundaye, and which the Jewes called the firſt daye of the Sabbathes, and not that which wee commonly call Munday.
               
               
                  S.
                  Howe ſo?
               
               
                  M.
                  Bicauſe it is euidente, that the Lorde wrought ſixe whole dayes togither, before the Sabbath & ſeuenth daye. And amonge the Hebrues, in olde time, that was the Sabbath and ſeuenth daye which wee nowe call Satterdaye, whiche is the next daye, beefore Sundaye, and next after Fridaye. For Chriſtians, to the entente that they woulde not retaine the auncient ceremoneis of the Jewes, but deuoutly to honour the reſurrection of our Lorde Jeſus Chriſt, wherby ther began a new ſtate of the Church, in ſtead of the Sabbath, they choſe the next daye following to reſt on, as it appeareth in the 20. Chapter of the Actes: the 1. to the Corinthians, the 16. chapter: and the firſt Chapter of the Reuclation: and alſo it is extant in the Eccleſiaſticall hiſtorie: which day they called the Lords day, or Sundaye. But, if you woulde number ſixe dayes beefore the Sabbath daye, you muſte begin vpon Sundaye, not vpon Mundaye: and ſo ſhall you haue ſixe daies, after which followeth the Sabbath, which is the ſeauenth: Thus: Firſt Sunday, then Munday. Tueſdaye, Wedenſday, Thurſeday, Fryday, after which followeth the Seauenth, whiche are the Sabbath dayes. So that the Lorde began his woorke of creating the worlde, vpon Sunday: which is confirmed to bee true, by a counſell holdē in Iudaea, as Euſ
                           •
                        bius writeth in the 5. booke of his hiſtorie, and the 23. and 25. Chapters,
               
               
                  S.
                  But in what Moneth ſeemeth it vnto you, that the

worlde was made.
               
               
                  M.
                  I will vtter, in this poinct that whiche ſeemeth vnto mee moſt likely, and I craue pardon herein, that no man thinke mee to bee curious: notwithſtanding I muſte needes vtter my minde, for that this queſtion is demaunded by many. Uerily, it ſemeth vnto mee, that the worlde was created in that moneth which is called by the Hebrues Tiſri, and is anſwereable partly vnto our moneth of Auguſt, and partly to September: for doubtles it began after the Autumnal or Haruaſt equinoctium. So that I doe nothinge agree vnto thoſe, that write & ſuppoſe that the world was made in the Moneth of March, and in the Springe.
               
               
                  S.
                  Can you confirme your opinion by any reaſon?
               
               
                  M.
                  Yea, and that by diuerſe. And not onely this, that in the time of Autumne or Haruaſt, the earth is moſt apt to receiue the ſeedes of good fruites, as of Wheat, and Barly, and ſuch like. For at that time, it ſeemeth moſt meete and fit to conceiue, as in the Springe to bringfoorth fruite: and in Summer to yelde them vp: and as for winter, then the earth digeſteth and concocteth the ſeedes that are cōmitted vnto hir, and embracing them in ye middes of hir boſome, frameth & nouriſheth them, as a mother doeth hir young, whiche, notwithſtanding, ſhee bringeth foorth in the ſpring tune, when they bee ſumwhat growne: and in Summer is quite del
                        •
                     uered of them, as beeinge then ripe and perfecte. Wherefore, the ſpringe and Summer, doe ſeeme rather to bee as it were midwiues to the earth, than to miniſter vnto it any force, or vertue to bringe foorth: whiche vertue notwithſtandinge Autumne yeeldeth vnto the earth, as beeing yet mindefull of the firſt creation

of all thinges, and of hir owne bringinge foorth of all manner commodities, reteininge vnto this preſent the force, effect, and power of the auncient commaundement, which the Lorde enioyned at that time. So y• the Hebrues will haue it, that this moneth Tiſri, ſhall not be ſo called of muſt or newe wine, but of iuce, wherof ye earth is full at that ſeaſon. And theſe bee the two reaſons of mine opinion. The fyrſt, for that as the ſcripture teacheth in the 28. chapter, and 9. verſe: and ſo folowinge of Leuiticus, this moneth hath beene alwayes, ſince the firſte age of man, as farre as euer there can bee had any remembrance, the beeginninge of the yeare and firſt moneth. And therefore, in contractes and bargaines, in cōmon and priuate affaires, and to bee briefe, in ſupputation of the yeares and age of the worlde, which was done by the yeares of Iubilee, the yeare euer beegan in this moneth among the auntient Fathers in old time, and among the Jewes: and ended alſo in the ſame. So that ye yeares & age of Adam, and the reſidue of the Fathers whiche liued both beefore the floude and ſince, are to bee reckened from this moneth. The ſeconde reaſon is this: For that the feaſt of Trumpettes which God commaunded to bee kept vpon the firſt daye of this moneth, ſeemeth to haue beene ſpecially inſtituted by God, to the intente, that the remembraunce of the firſt originall and creation of the worlde, whiche was doone vppon that day might bee holily preſerued & continued in the Church. Truely, it was not in vaine, that ye Lord would haue that day kept holy, & ſo great honour & reuerēce attributed vnto theſe trumpettes & Inſtruments whiche wee reade, at that time, were ſo toſſed & blowne. But

by that great and pleaſant ſownd, hee ment to admoniſh and put in remēbraunce, men, & the whole world alſo, of their firſt natiuitie, which as by the ſpecial prouiſion of God, it fell vpon the firſte daye of this moneth, ſo was it godlily and reuerently renued and remembred in the Church, that the world might not bee ignorant of it owne byrth daye. Whereby alſo it came to paſſe, that God cōmaunded many feaſtes and holidaies to bee kept in ye ſeauenth moneth, which moneth was called alſo Aetanim, that is to ſaye, the Moneth of ſtrength or ſtrong thinges. 1. Kinges, the 8. chap. and 2. verſe. Yea, ſome ſaye alſo, that our Sauiour Chriſt was borne the ſame moneth, and not without ſome reaſon.
               
               
                  S.
                  But it is ſaide in the 12. Chapter, and 1. verſe of Exodus, that Niſan was the firſt moneth of the yeare, anſwering vnto our monethes of March and April, and falling in the Uernall or Springe equinoctium

                  You ſay well. But therevnto I anſwere two waies: Firſt, that Niſan or March was not alwayes the beeginning of the yeere, but at length after that the children of Iſraell returned out of Egyt, in the remēbrance of ſo great a benefite, that is to ſay, for the conſeruation of the memorie of the newe founding & reſtoaringe of that people. Moreouer, Niſan was not the beeginning of the yeere, for all things that were done among the people of God, but onely in reſpect of their holie & feſtiuall daies, and of the tabernacle. For the tabernacle, as it had it owne peculiare reuolution, and differinge from the common: ſo had it alſo a proper beginninge of the yeere, not agreeing with the order of the Politike yeere: to the intent that men mighte knowe

that there was a difference too bee put beetweene the Politike and Eccleſiaſtical gouernment, and that the reaſon of them both is diuerſe, and their nature ſeparate and diſtinct.

                  As ſome doe ſuppoſe, ſince the tyme that the worlde was made, vnto this preſent yeere 1578. wherin this booke was written, are about 5298. yeeres.

                  M.
                  Euen by this ſhort reckninge. Frō the creation of the world vnto the generall diluge, whiche happened in the daies of Noe, are numbred in the Hiſtorie of the holy Scriptures 1656. yeeres. And from the diluge, vnto the promiſe whiche God made firſte vnto Abraham, and his departing vpon commaundment out of Vr, a Citie of the Chaldees, and Charris a citie of Meſopotamia, are 427. yeeres. And from that promiſe, vnto the departure of the children of Iſraell out of the land of Egypt, which was vnder Moſes, are 430. yeeres, as it is written in the 12. chapter, and 40. verſe of Exodus. And from the departure out of the land of Egypt, vnto the beginning of the building of Salomons temple, which was begun the fourth yeere of Salomons reigne, are 480. yeeres, as it appeareth the 1. Kinges, and 6. chap. And from that tyme, vnto the leading away of the Jewes into the captiuitie of Babylon, I meane that whiche beegan vnder King Ioachim, are about 167. yeres, or ſumwhatleſſe. In this captiuitie the people aboade the ſpace of 70. yeeres, according as Ieremy the Prophet foretold them in the 25. chapter. And from the departure of the

Jewes out of the captiuitic of Babylon, and from the day of the publication of Cyrus edict concerning the deliueryng and ſendyng home of the Jewes into their owne coūtrey, vnto the paſſion of Chriſt, are 70. weekes of yeeres, that is to ſaye, 490. yeeres, as the Prophet Daniell writeth: Daniell the 9. chapter. And from the paſſion of Chriſt vnto this our preſent tyme, are 1578. yeeres. So that if all theſe numbers be gathered toogether into one ſumme, they make 5298. whiche is the diſtance of yeeres ſince the creation of the worlde: although the Rabbines of the Jewes do diſſent from this ſumme of yeres. Howbeit, we follow the Scriptures herein, and alſo the beſt learned auctours that haue written moſt truely in this beehalf.

                  I can eaſily tell you that, and diſpatche the whole matter in one woorde. The worlde was created a good world, not onely generally, but alſo euerie parte thereof. For after euerie dayes woorke, Moſes addeth playnly and perfectly theſe woordes: And God ſaw that it was good: for ſo it is written in the 1. Chapter of Geneſis.
                  
               
               
                  S.
                  What doth that goodnes comprehend and ſignifie?
               
               
                  M.
                  Uerily, not holineſſe of life and conuerſation, neither

vprightnes of conſcience. For, moſt of the partes of the worlde haue neither ſenſe, neither reaſon, nor conſcience, without whiche there can bee no holineſſe of life. Wherefore, this word, Good, ſeemeth vnto mee to ſignifie three things ſpecially.

                  What bee they?
               
               
                  M.
                  Firſt, the perfection & integritie of the natures which God created, and of the whole worlde: ſecondly the beautie: thirdly the commoditie, I iudge to bee noted by that word. For, thoſe thinges whiche are perfect, and whole: and likewiſe faire, and profitable: are called good, and that by common cuſtome of all men. Although S. Auguſtine in his booke de natura boni againſt the Manichees, beſides the ſubſtance and eſſence of thoſe three thinges, hath ſet doune theſe three thinges, as certeine vniuerſall good thinges, too wit, meaſure, fourme, and ordre, of whiche he ſaieth thus: Therefore, where theſe three bee great, there bee great good thinges: where they bee ſmall, there bee ſmall good thinges: and where they bee not, there is no goodthing. Howbeit, I chooſe rather to follow mine owne opinion, and to keepe the effect and meaning of theſe wordes, and hee ſaw that they were good.
                  
               
               
                  S.
                  Expounde this more plainly.
               
               
                  M.
                  This worlde, and all thinges that are created therein, were euery one of them good, if wee conſider of thē as thei were made by GOD at the beeginning, in reſpecte of their owne nature. For thei had it then perfecte and whole, that is to ſaie, in no parte failyng: at that tyme ſounde and ſtrong, and not as it is nowe, weake, ſicke, and wounded. So that the Nature of Heauen and Earth was moſte perfecte, and likewiſe of all Beaſtes and liuyng thynges, Hearbes, Trees,

and other creatures of God: their ſtrength alſo pliant and forcible, and not as thei bee now adaies, weake and imperfect, ſcarce able to ſuſteine themſelues, or to doe theyr duety and function, neyther alwaies able to dooe it. Moreouer, if wee conſider the beautie of thoſe thynges, and of the whole worlde as it was made at the firſte, in reſpecte whereof, bothe the whole worlde was good, and euery one of his partes were good. For thei had in themſelues a merueilous comelineſſe of outward fourme and ſhape, and gliſtering beautie: thei were pleaſant and delectable to beholde, and had due and conuenient proportion of all the partes and members in euery bodie: in reſpecte whereof, and alſo for that as yet there remaine many tokens of it, it is now at this daie called by the Grecians Koſmos, of the comelineſſe thereof. Thei had alſo a wounderfull order in reſpecte of the whole worlde. For euery thyng was by GOD placed in conuenient and apte place moſte wiſely, and thei agreed among themſelues with wounderfull concorde, and mutuall good will one toward another: and heauen was anſwerable too the earth, and the earth to heauen, ſo farre foorthe and at what tyme the one had neede to helpe the other. Whiche now, diſcord through ſynne beyng diſperſed amōg them, dooe ſeldome helpe one another, neither dooeth heauen yeilde raine in due ſeaſon vnto the earth, neither dooeth the earth ſende vp erhalations and vapours vnto heauen in conueniente tyme, and when neede requireth. To bee ſhorte, the profite alſo and commoditie of theſe thynges, as thei were by GOD created, was very greate, in reſpect wherof the whole worlde, and all his partes were called good. For the

ſtrength and powers of euery one of them were ſoūd, and of force to woorke and bryng forthe that, wherevnto God had ordeined them. Thei were frutefull, bicauſe they reteined as yet the power and bleſſynge, whiche GOD had giuen them, whole, and vndefiled: ſynne had not yet hindred, or diminiſhed it: whiche power is as it were now deade and buried, ſo that there appeareth not ſo muche as the leaſt part thereof vnto vs, ſpecially in this latter, and as it were, crooked old age of the worlde, whiche ſo greate and manifold giftes of God, ſhould haue perpetually continued in all creatures, if man had not tranſgreſſed.

                     WHat maner one is this worlde nowe, ſince Adams trangreſſion?
               
               
                  M.
                  Euen ſuch an one, as S. Paule deſcribeth in one woorde, to wit, a creature now ſubiect vnto vanitie. And therefore it ſigheth and groneth, looking for the reſtoaring of the ſunnes of God: Romanes the 8. chapter, and 20. verſe. So that this vanitie is contrarie too that goodnes, wherein thinges were firſt created.
               
               
                  S.
                  How then, did mans tranſgreſſion take away the eſſence and nature of thinges?
               
               
                  M.
                  Not ſo, but it impaired the integritie and perfection of them. For ſinne brought in three thinges with it eſpecially, which are contrarie vnto thoſe three aboue named commodities. To wit, weakeneſſe, as it were a ſicknes in the naturall powers, diſorder and diſagreement

among thinges for lacke of order, and then when they are not fitly anſwerable one too another, there followeth barrennes in ingendring and bringing foorth of young, and fruites: the 4. of Eſdras, the 5. chapter, and 52. verſe. In ſo much, that the ſtrength and plentifulnes of the earth, and of all other thinges decreaſeth dayly, and are nothing nowe in reſpect as God firſt created them, whiche cummeth too paſſe by reaſon of mans trangreſſion, as it may eaſily bee gathered out of the 4. chapter of Ieremie, and 24. and 25. verſes. Finally, in reſpect hereof, this whole world is made, as it were, a confuſed miſt, ſpecially the inferiour and elementare part thereof: Iob the 10. chap. and 21. and 22. verſes: alſo mortall and tranſitorie, as it is writen in the Prouerbes, the 31. chapter, and 8. verſe: and 2. of Peter, the 3. chapter, and 10. verſe, ſo that it may one day periſh and bee deſtroied.
               
               
                  S.
                  Was not then this worlde mortall and tranſitorie. beefore mans tranſgreſſion?
               
               
                  M.
                  I can ſay nothyng concerning that point, bicauſe the Scripture herein teacheth mee not any thyng. Howbeit this one thing I may affirme, that this world of it ſelf and in reſpect that it was a creature, was ſubiect to alteration, vnleſſe GOD did ſuſteine, and preſerue it. But whether God would alwaies haue preſerued and ſuſteined it, if man had not trangreſſed, I will not ſay. As for man, for whoſe ſake this worlde was created, to bee as it were his dwelling houſe, although hee ſhould haue bin immortall, as S. Auguſtine writeth after the booke of wiſedome, in his booke De Agone Chriſtiano: yet ſhould they at length one after another haue binne tranſlated into heauen into a better

ſtate. But whether there ſhould alwaies haue bin ſome men in the worlde, and ſome ſhould alwayes haue liued heere, I doe not know.

                     NOw, if the worlde, and all the partes thereof were created ſo good at the firſt: from whence then ſprang ſo many poyſons, ſo many hurtfull things, and deadlye hearbes, ſo many Serpentes with the ſight of their eyes only peſtiferous vntoo men?
               
               
                  M.
                  By ſinne and for the ſinne of man, theſe ſo many Plagues, venimes, poyſons, hurtful hearbes, and noyſom beaſtes ſprang vp, as the wordes of the Lorde doe declare in the booke of Moſes, Geneſis the 3. chapter, and 18. verſe. For God made nothing at the beginnyng that was vnto any thing poyſon, deadly, hurtfull, and diſcommodious. Wherfore, if thinges had continued in that nature wherein almightie God created them at the firſt, there ſhould now be neither poyſons, neither euill thinges. For it is not poſſible that any thing ſauyng that which is good ſhould bee made, or proceede from hym that is moſt good. Yea, there is nothyng at this day that is abſolute and in all reſpectes poyſon, but that whiche is hurtfull, as too man: is profitable and holſome to another, as to a Serpent.
               
               
                  S.
                  I vnderſtand you. But why will God haue poyſons, noyſom herbes, and hurtfull beaſtes to remaine now

in the earth, ſince mans tranſgreſſion?
               
               
                  M.
                  There maye ſundrie cauſes bee alleaged, but ſpecially two, which S. Auguſt. bringeth forth in his 3. booke, and 17. chap. de Geneſi ad Literam. The firſt cauſe why theſe doe continue, is for puniſhment and reuenge againſt Man. And therefore they doe all hurt Man, for whoſe offence ſake they bee made poiſon. Moreouer, they bee profitable to prooue, tempt, and exerciſe Man, to the entent that hee maye acknowledge his owne infirmitie, & aſke helpe of God. But this thirde reaſon may bee alſo alledged, that thoſe hearbes whiche bee hurtfull vnto man, as Hemlock, woulfbane, coloquintida, & ſuch like, are the euil iuce of the earth, and as it were certeine excremētes which are needful too bee expelled, to the ende that the iuce of the other frutes of the earth maye remaine good and ſincere, & holſome and commodious vnto vs.
               
               
                  S.
                  If the thinges which God created firſt, were ſo good, (for Moſes ſayde not onely that they were good, but alſo that they were very good) what difference then is there beetweene God himfelfe, and his woorkes?
               
               
                  M.
                  There is a threefolde, and that moſt large & wide difference between them. To wit, that God of himſelf is moſt excellent, & vnchangeable good. But ye creatures are not ſo of thēſelues, but of God: not excellently, but ſo far as their nature will ſuffer: not ſo vnchangeably good but that they might fall away from it. For that goodneſſe coulde neuer haue decayed in them, & haue bene chaunged into vanitie, if ſo bee thei had bene vnchaungeably good. Howbeit, to the ende wee ſhoulde not doubt y• they were good, Moſes added this plainly. God ſawe that they were good.

                     WHy did Moſes adde theſe words expreſty?
               
               
                  M.
                  For two cauſes. To ye intent we ſhould not lightly paſſe ouer theſe woordes of God, as many doe, as though they conteined in them no excellencie, or notable qualitie, whiche mighte mooue vs vnto admiration. For in deed they haue ſo in them, and the Lorde himſelfe teſtifieth the ſame. And therefore, much leſſe that wee ought to condemne, diſpraiſe, and mocke at ſo excellent woorkes of God, bicauſe of the confuſion and diſorder which nowe is in them through Mans tranſgreſſion, as did that blaſphemous felowe Momus and the Mamchees, and Marcianite heretikes. For wee cannot ſo doe with out offeringe greate iniurie vnto God, and in ſo doeing, wee take the Lordes name in vaine. Wherefore, the Mamchees, are to bee condemned, and whoſoeuer elſe doe contende that the creatures of themſelues, and as God firſt made them, were euill. For that is moſt falſe, as it appeareth in the 1. to Timothie, the 4. Chapter, and 4. verſe. Moreouer, this admonition and ſayinge mooueth mee not to diſpute this queſtion whiche certaine curious felowes haue doone, to wit, whether God could haue created euery particulare thing, or the whole worlde better: or now coulde if neede were frame it in more abſolute ſtate, than hee firſt created it. For to ſeeke and ſearche this, what is it other, than to paſſe thoſe bondes whiche the Spirite of God hath laide beefore vs, and to folowe

our owne wandringe mindes? For God made all things that hee created, very good. To conclude, this admonition is very profitable vnto vs in this reſpect, that wee doe not raſhely abuſe the creatures of God (which many tymes ſeeme vile vnto vs) intemperately at our luſt and pleaſure, which y• holy Ghoſt himſelfe pronounceth to bee ſo precious. Wherefore wee ought to vſe them, ſoberly, modeſtly, and wiſely.

                  But why was that ſaiyng, And the Lorde ſawe that it was good, let paſſe in the woorke of ſome daies, as of the ſeconde daie?
               
               
                  M.
                  Bicauſe that daie conteineth onely the beginnyng of the whole woorke, whiche was made afterward, and not the conſummation and finiſhyng thereof. And therefore that bleſſyng is deferred vnto the ende of the woorke.

                  S.
                  
                     BUt foraſmuch as now you are in handling the ſtate of the world, wherin it was firſt made, tell mee I pray you, whether that opinion bee true, concerninge the thinges that were firſt created, whether God made two contraries, & the one to ſtriue againſt an other? Thus they ſaye colde thinges and hotte, highe and lowe, white and blacke, greate and ſmall were firſt created, to the ende that the force of things might bee preſerued in a certaine temperament, by theſe contraries. This is written in Eccleſiaſticus the 42. chapter, and 25. verſe: and the 33. Chapter, & 15.

verſe. Whiche alſo S. Auguſtine in his 2. booke de Ciuitate Dei, and 18 chapter: and Irenaeus in his 2. booke, and 43. chapter, doe followe.
               
               
                  M.
                  It is true whiche you ſay. For God made not althinges at the firſte of one qualitie, colour, and greatnes, neither of one kind and nature. But hee made ſome high ſome lowe, ſome moyſt ſome drie, ſome warme ſome cold, the day to bee one thing and the night another. Yet God made nothing that was eeuill. But why hee created them in ſuche varietie, this is the cauſe: both for that the power and wiſedome of God is thereby more apparant: and alſo the thinges themſelues by this repugnancie of contrarie vertues and natures, and mitigacion of them, may bee the more eaſely preſerued. For what maner ſtate of thinges would there haue bin, if all thinges had bin hoat? what numneſſe, if all thinges had bin cold? what miſerie, if all wayes there had bin darknes? what weariſomneſſe, if it had alwaies bin daye? And therefore when God had created the natures of this worlde, and of the thinges conteined therein, hee thought it conuenient to refreſh and eaſe them with change and courſe, becauſe they were bodies, or apperteinyng to bodies: and likewiſe to nouriſhe them with a certein mutuall knot and temperament, bicauſe they were diuerſe partes of one whole thyng: hee ingraffed alſo contrarie qualities in them, that the one ſhould bee a let, bridle, and temperament to the other. And to bee ſhort, to the intent there ſhould bee chaunge and alteration in theſe thinges, that there might bee ſome differēce plainly perceiued beetweene the eſſence of them and of the angels, & alſo of God hymſelf, who needeth

no ſutch meanes for his preſeruation. Euen ſo likewiſe, a well gouerned citie conſiſteth of ſundry orders and of diuerſe fortes of men, ritche, poore, faire, foule, Subiectes, Magiſtrates, young, olde, Huſbandmen, Souldiours, who are of diuerſe ſtates and vnlike callinges, and many tymes alſo of contrarie. Notwithſtanding they bee neceſſarie for the preſeruation of the mutuall ſafetie of the whole citie, wherby it beecummeth the more beautifull, the more plentifull and conuenient for the vſe of this life. And therfore I will confirme this opinion with the moſte excellent teſtimonie of Tertullian, who in the 45. chapter of his Apologeticum, writeth thus: which reaſon made the vniuerſalitie out of diuerſitie, that all thinges might appeare togither from many ſubſtances into an vnitie: out of voyd and ſound: out of liuyng and vnliuyng: out of comprehenſible and incomprehenſible: out of light and darknes, and out of life and death. Neither doe wee notwithſtanding, fauour the errour of the Manichees, who hold opinion, that at the beeginning there were twoo Giauntes whiche afflicted mutually one another, one of the light, and another of darknes. There is one, and the ſame, and onely God, who made all thinges, and moſte wiſely inſtituted this contrarietie for the preſeruation of the whole woorke.
               
               
                  S.
                  But this varietie of things ſeemeth to bring in great diſcord, when it had bin more meete that this worlde beeing, as it were, a certein whole thing, ſhould haue bin builded and compacted of partes freindly and louingly agreeing one with another. Which thing, this contrarietie among creatures, doth ſeeme very mutch to withſtande.
               
               
                  M.
                  You gather not well. For this diſſimulitude amonge

thinges, and varietie of contrarie qualities and properties, bringeth in no diſcorde, but rather cauſeth great concorde and agreement. Like as in mans bodie, the diuerſitie of the partes & members, and theyr force, action, moouinge, place and office, which many times are contrarie, declareth that there is greate agreement amonge the members, and is alſo neceſſarie for the life, gouerment, and defence of the whole body. The like truely is to bee ſeene in the world, for it is one bodie, and conteined within one compaſſe. And why the diſcorde of thinges ſo muth diſagreeing is ſo friendly and agreeinge, and ſo conſenting vnto it ſelfe, and alſo firme and durable, the great and incomprehēſible wiſedom of almighty God is the cauſe, who hath contempered all thoſe thinges excellently one with another as they ought to bee, and hath made them of apt and conuenient weight, number, and meaſure, both in reſpect of themſelues, and in compariſon alſo of other thinges, as it is written in the booke of Wiſdom the 11. chapter, and 21. verſe▪ and S. Auguſtine afterwarde alſo declareth the ſame in his 4. booke de Geneſi ad Literam. But what weight, number, and meaſure this is, or what is the proportiō of their mingling togither, by reaſon of whiche this world is ſo agreeing and meete one parte with another, and of all among themſelues, although the Philoſophers haue by diſputation curiouſly vexed themſelues herein, and yet neither founde it out, neither declared it: God knoweth, and hee himſelfe onely.

                  Whether GOD haue ceaſſed altogither to create any thing ſince ye time y• hee made an ende of the world, ſeeing hee ſeemeth dayly to create mens ſoules out of nothing, and hee yet woorketh ſtill, as Chriſte teacheth vs in the 5. chapter, and 17. verſe of S. Iohn.

                  An eaſie matter to aunſwere. For God is ſaide to ceaſſe, onely in reſpect of this worlde and the woorke which then hee had vndertaken to doe, that is to ſay, in compariſon of an other, as S. Auguſtine anſwereth in his 4. booke de Geneſi ad Literam. And not altogether & abſolutely, as although God neither gouerned nowe this world which he made, neither were able to make any new thing more ſeeing there is nothyng made or doone now, but by his woorking. Whoſe moſt louing & tender prouidence, hath alwaies gouerned, & doeth now gouerne whatſoeuer he hath created. Whoſe infinite power woorketh euery thing in euery thing, as S. Paule writeth to the Epheſians, the 1. chapter, and 23. verſe. Finally, whoſe ſtrength and vertue are neither impaired by weakenes through proceſſe of time, wherby they are leſſe able euery day to create many things, neither are they beecome ſlacker or ſlower in woorkinge, Therefore the Lorde yet euery daye createth many newe thinges, to wit, the ſoules of men. Howbeeit, all that his purpoſed woorke, and the fulneſſe, and bewtie of this worlde, hee made moſte perfectly, and finiſhed moſt abſolutely in euery poinct & part, in

the ſpace of thoſe ſixe dayes, & reſted the ſeauenth day. God ſanctified, ſayth S. Auguſtine, no day of hys woorke, but onely the day of his reſt, that it might bee vnderſtoode that God is more bleſſed than his woorkes. For hee was delighted with none of his woorkes ſo much as with himſelfe. So hee ſanctified the daye of his reſt, and not of his woorke.
                      And nowe bycauſe wee are come to the day of Gods reſt, let vs reſte alſo in this place, and make an ende of this diſputation whiche wee erewhile began. So much as may ſeeme can bee ſaide generally concernyng the creation of the world, and the firſt beeginning of all things apperteining vnto Chriſtian Naturall Philoſophie, wee haue heere for the moſt part declared. And wee giue thankes vnto God, for that hee hath giuen vs a minde and abilitie to write thoſe things which wee haue heere declared.(:)
