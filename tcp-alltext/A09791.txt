               thyng vnto the of the quietnesse of mīde and of those thynges / in Timeus / that thou thynkest nedeth more exquisite declaration. Trewly / where as Eros my frēde was redy to sayle towardes Rome and I had receyued hastely of Fūdanus the honest man the letters / & I had nat therfore leysar to apply me to that that thou desyredest / as I wolde haue done / nor agayne coude I suffre the man to be seen sent fro me with empty handes / certeyn chosen thynges I haue taken forth of the quietnesse of mynde / out of the comētaris that somtyme I made. And (as I thynke) ī such declaration thou sekes

nat the delicacy of sayeng / and the piked delight of spech / and thou hast consyderatyon onely of some doctryne / to be as helpe for the lyfe to be ordred. & I iuge it very well doone / that where thou hast great priualte with princes / & that nat in cōmen thingꝭ / & that ī the glori of maters of iugemēt / no man is afore the / yet for all that thou dasyst nat folysshly at the fawnyng of glory / that wōders and exaltes the / as doth Merops in the tragedy. Oftimes also thou remēbrest that thou hast herde / that sore toos are nat esed with gorgious showes / nor the whit thlowe with a ring / nor the hedach with a crowne. For to what purpose is thuse of money for the eschewyng of the sickenesse of the mynde / or for the easy & sure passage of lyfe? Or wherto serueth the vse of glorie / or among courtiers apparēce? Onelesse that they to whom these thyngꝭ chaūce / can wisely vse thē whan they haue them: and agayne whan they want thē / ouer suffre the desyres of thē. and what any other thyng is that / than reason accustomed and fore thought / to restrayne quickly / & nat to suffre to stray the apasionate parte of the mynde / wantyng

reason / whan it breketh forth / and to suffre it to forbeare whan it is ouertwharted / with assayling affections. Therfore / as Xenophon bad men in prosperous thynges chefely to remēbre the goddes / and to worshyp them than best / that whan case required with bet

Laertes lyueng twenty yeres ī the coūtrey (as it is said) only with an olde woman to serue hym of his meate and drinke / fled from his countrey and princely paleys / & had neuertheles sadnesse and frownyng debate in cōpany. what
