            Thirdly, our mother the holie catholike churche, in that ſhe hath children to nouriſh and inſtructe, ſhe hathe aucthoritie to make lawes, tradicions, and or dinaunces for them, for the better conſeruation of order, and the more reuerent miniſtration of the worde of God. For otherwiſe, why did the Apoſtle geue tradicions? Why did he ſay, Haec ego dico, non Dominus. This isi. Cor. vij my ſaiyng, and not the lordes? Why did he reproue certein for breaking cuſtomes of preching of praiyng, of cutting heire, noti. Cor. xi.
               
conteined in ſcripture? Why did S. Ihon the Baptiſt bind his diſciples to certeine faſtes, andMath ix Luc. xi. Act. xv certeine Praiers, beſides the ſcripture? Why did S. Iames by the conſent of the reſt, make a decree, that euery man ſhould abſtein from ſtrangled beaſres, from bloud, and from thynges offred vp to Idolles, which no Scripture commannded? Why durſt the Apoſtle after that decree, make himſelfe ſo bolde as ſo ſaie, all thinges are cleane toAd Tit. i. i. Cor. x the cleane, and whatſoeuer cometh to the ſhambles, that eate you hardelye? Why durſte our forefathers againe, accordyng to the time, be ſo bolde, as (in a ſort) to make a reſtraint herof? The holie Doctour S. Auguſtine in this behalfe, letteth not

            This was the filthie ſinke, and ſwillowe of all theſe tragedies whiche hathe raged well nighe ouer all Chriſtendome, oute of the which hath roked of late ſo many ſtinkyng filthie contagious Hereſies, as ſins Chriſtes paſſion hath neuer the like ben heard of attones: And no merueil▪ when the hedge is broken, euery man lightely goeth ouer.

            Fifthly our mother the holie catholike Churche, in that ſhee hath to her pappes the two teſtamentes, tholde, and the new, Euen as all women haue geuē vnto theim by nature, ſence to diſcerne the good temperature of their owne pappes, from the diſtemperature of the ſame▪ ſo hath the Churche geuen her by God, aucthoritie to diſcerne the true Scriptures from the forged, the autentical from the Apocriphal. For otherwyſe

why ſhould we allow & receiue S. Markes Goſpell, whiche neuer ſawe Chriſte, nor hearde Chriſt, and diſalowe and reiect Nichodems Goſpelle, whiche was conuerſaunt with Chriſt? Why ſholde we then allow and receiue the Goſpel of S. Luke beyng but a diſciple, & diſalowe and reiecte the Goſpel of ſ. Iames, beyng an apoſtle? whycheMat. xiij. Math. ij. & in pro Goſpel Origene citeth. And S Ierome alſo, he citeth the Goſpel of Nazares: but as a thyng vtterly Apocriphal: except onely one particle therin of the woman taken in aduoutrie, which particle by the iudgement of diuerſe profoundly learned, was takē out frō thens, & ſo inſert in to the Goſpel of S Ihon. The boke of Iob, the. ii. laſt bookes

of the kynges, the Goſpel of S. Marke, thepiſtle to Thebrues and certeine other Scriptures beſides, are this daie all autenticall, and euer haue been, notwithſtandyng many haue douted of thaucthors of thē
               ▪ Wherfore more then euidēt it is, that the Scriptures, as thei taketh their veritie of the holie ghoſte, ſo taketh thei their approbatiō not of thauctours, but rather of the catholike churche. In ſomuche that S. Auguſtine he is not a fearde to ſaie: EuangelioContra epiſt. quae dicitur fundāmē
                   non crederem, niſi me authoritas Eccleſiae commoueret. I woulde not beeleue the Goſpell it ſelfe to be autentical, vnleſſe thaucthoritie of the church didde aduertiſe, and moue me ſo to doe. And this moche for this point.
            
               Finally our mother the holie catholike Churche in that ſhee hath to her milke the true ſence of the worde of God, ſhee hath likewiſe aucthoritie to iudge, & deciſe al matiers of controuerſy in religiō. For if the ſcripture of tholde lawe in Moſes tyme was not made the highe iudge of controuerſies (beyng a thing it ſelfe in diuerſe pointes called in controuerſie) but aucthoritie of Iudgemente was geuen alwaies by goddes owne mouth to the learned, and eldres of the Sinagog, to whoſe iudgement all were bounde to ſtande, and that vnder peine of preſēt deth, as appeareth in the booke ofDeu xvij Deuteronomi, if wee Chriſtiās will not bee counted in woorſſe ſtate, and condicion, then the

Iewes were, nedes muſte wee graunt to the catholike churche like aucthoritie of Iudgement for the deciſion of al controuerſies in our Religion: whome if God didde not aſſiſt euermore, with the true intelligence of ſcripture, then ſhould the ſcripture ſtande the Churche in as good ſtede, as a paier of ſpectacles ſhoulde ſtande a blynde Frier. But queſtionles the catholike churche in this behaulf ſhe is ſo directed of God the father, who is verax, true: of GodIo. viij. the Soonne, who is veritas, theIo. xiiij trueth: of God the holie Ghoſt, who is veritatis ſpiritus, the ſpiritIo. xi

His reaſon was this. Sithē God, woulde not ſuffre hysLib. regis Hen. viij. cōt. Luth Churche to myſtake a boke of ſcripture, for peril of damnable hereſies that may enſue therō
               ▪ & like peril maie ēſue by the miſconſtruyng of the ſentence, as by the miſtakyng of the boke: nedes muſt it folowe, that god wil, in matiers of our faith, no

more ſuffre his churche to take a falſe ſentence for true, then to take a falſe boke for ſcripture. Whyche reaſon at a bluſh may ſeeme to bee grounded in ſome pointe, euen vpon this ſaiyng of Sainct Hierome. Qua lege

For geue ones euery mā libertie to iudge of the Scriptures after his owne braine, after his owne deuiſe, and phātaſie, thē ſhall you haue as many diuerſe ſectes ſodēly ſprōg, as is diuerſity of idle braines euery where For in theſe matiers we ſe comonlie, the more blinde, the more bold: the more ignoraunt the more buſie: the leſſe wittie, the more inquiſitiue: the more fooles, the more talkatiue yea, and wil take on them ſcoutche

Tuum eſt de pulmentarijs cogitare, non dogmata diuina decoquere.
               
Sir cooke (ſaith he) if is your Office to ſee to pottage makyng, to Cates of the Kitchine, and Cookerie, and not to controule Goddes doctrine, neither to entrecounter againſt holie writte.

Mete is it for the ſhomaker to iudge of ſhoes, the Phiſicion of Phiſique, the carpenter of building, the cooke of cokery, and euerye crafteſman of hys owne Occupatione. So that the Iudgement▪ and

For what other thing I pray you, ment Saint CirilIo. lib. iij. cap. xxx▪

dead in ſoule, through miſbeleuyng, no merueile, I ſaie, it is at all.

And wt this their audacitie march g agaīſt the church as Tert. ſaith furth with the ſtrongeſt in faith thei moued: the weaker thei we ried: the wekeſt of al thei ētrapped: the waueryng thei ſente away with a ſcruple in their cō

How coulde he haue expreſſed hys mynde more playnlye, more euidently, more ſimply, than to ſaye, this is this: this is my bodie: yea & that bodye toe, whiche ſhalbe betraied for you? If this be not playne inoughe, I can not tell, what is playne inough. Thys beleued playnlye vpon oure ſauiours playne wordes fyrſt the holy doctour S. Damaſcene,li. iiij. ca. xiiij. who ſaieth: Non eſt figura panis & uinum corporis & ſanguinis domini. Abſit.

The breade and the wine it is not a figure only of the bodie & bloude of Chriſt, (god for fende that) but it is our lordes owne bodie, ioyned vnto the godhed, our lorde him ſelfe ſaying, this is my bodie: not a figure of my bodye, but my bodie: this is my blude: not a figure of my blude, but my bloude. This beleued againe playnely vpon our ſauiours playne wordes, the holye doctor S. Ambroſe, who ſaith. Antequam conſecretur, panis eſt:De ſacra. li. iiij.

               Before it be conſecrated, it is bread: but after the wordes of Chriſt are ones come vnto it, thā is it the very bodie of chriſt: And before ye wordes of chriſt are prouounced, the chaliſſe is full of wyne and water: but after the wordes of Chriſt hathe ones wrought vpon it, than is it made the very blude of chriſt, whiche redemed the worlde.
            This beleued alſo playnly vpō out ſauiours playne wordes, the holye doctour S. Iohan. with the golden mouthe, who ſaith: Credamus ubi

The reaſon ſhal be thꝭ. Other you muſt graunte the reall preſence of our ſauiour chriſtes owne very

bodie and bloude, in the holye and bleſſed ſacrament, (as the trueth is), other els muſt you make vs beleue, that al thaūciant authors and godly perſōs, all the holy Marters and Cō
               feſſours, all the holy fathers & catholyke wryters, that euer wrote theſe. xv. hundreth yeres and more, euen frō thapoſtles tyme hitherto, you muſt make vs beleue, I ſay, that theſe, in this moſt highe and wayghtye mater of oure fayeth, were all, moſt ſhāfully blynded: al, moſt ſhāfully diſceaued: yea al, moſt vndoubtedly dāpned. For had not they all, (as it appereth by there workes well conſtrued & wel vnderſtāde), the ſelfe ſame fayth in the bleſſed ſacrament, that y• catholikes haue at this

preſent? Dyd not they all be leue inwardelye in there heartes, there preſent the very bodie and bloude of chriſt▪ Proteſt it in ther writingꝭ, the very bodye and bloude of Chriſt?
            Confeſſe it with ther mouthes the very body & bloud of chriſt? Receaue it in to their bodies, as the very bodie and bloude of chriſt? Reuerence it in their lyuing, as the very bodye & bloud of chriſt? Die in yt beleife, that it was, the very bodie & bloude of chriſt? Wherefore, if it were not the very bodye & bloude of chriſt in dede, howe can it than otherwiſe be thought, but that they, beginnyng in a wronge beleife, continuyng in a wronge beleif, diyng in awrong beleif, muſt nedes be counted, to haue

been all, moſt ſhāfully blynded: al, moſt ſhāfully diſceaued: yea al, moſt vndoubtedly▪ dāpned? O what an abſurditie, what an inconuenience is this? was Ignatius that bleſſed martyr dāpned, (trowe you?) Ireneus that bleſſed martir, was he dāpned toe? S. Cyprian that bleſſed martir, was he alſo dampned? was S. Hilarie dāpned, S. Baſil dampned, S. Hierō dampned, S. Ambroſe dampned S. Auſten dampned, were all the holye Martirs and Confeſſours, all the holye Doctours and aunciant authours, all the catholyke writers with an infinite numbre of oure fore fathers, were they all dāpned?

O lorde god, what a wonderfull mater is thys. Is it lykelye, (thynke with your ſelfes good brethrē), thinke wt your ſelfes, is it likely, yt chriſt, who promiſed to wt hꝭ church to y• worldes ende, & to inſtruct her in all kinde of trueth, is it likely, that he wolde ſuffre ſo many holy marters, ſo many holy confeſſours, ſo many holy doctors, ſo many thouſande thouſandes of our forefathers, ſo many hundreth yeares, ſo ſhamefully to be blynded, in ſo highe apoint of our faith and religion? Neuer thinke it good brethren, neuer thynke it: lette neuer ſuche an abſurditie, ſinke in to your ſtomakes. Wherfore to auoide this vnreſonable abſurditie & inconuenience, nedes

muſt it be confeſſed, as aplayn, ſure, and vndoubtable trueth, that the preſēce of y• very bodye and bloude of Chriſt, (chriſt, I ſaye, god and man,) is here cō
               tayned really and ſubſtancially in the moſt holy and bleſſed ſacrament of thaulter. Wherfore to conclud this part, heare you now the earneſt obteſtation & requeſt, your mother the holy catholyke church maketh vnto you, callynge you all, children: not al, for the preſente, but for that paſt, and that to come: vſingHomilia do. octa.

what by crooke, wrong oute of the handes of the Clergie, not only benefices and Tithes, but alſo the beſt part of the temporalities of Biſhoprikes, hathe thei delte (thinke you) charitably with theim therin? No verely, vnleſſe you wille call that Charitie, whyche Iulianus the Appoſtata ones vſed with the Chriſtians. This Iulianus,Chronic. Cario. whiles hee impoueriſhed the chriſtians, pulling from th
                  •
                their goodes, and poſſeſſiones, he pretended charitie towards theim, bearyng theim in hande he did thē a great benefite, and a great good tourne therin. For he ſaied, he entended their impoueriſhmēt for a good purpoſe to thende, that thei being made poore, ſhoulde the more eaſely

obteine the kingdome of heauē becauſe it is written. Beati pauperes,Math. ix. quoniam ipſorum eſt regnū coelorum. Bleſſed bee the poore for to theim beelongethe the Kyngedome of Heauen. If then certeine of the laitie, hath entēded ſuche charitie in theire doinges towardes the Clergy, is not the Clergie muche beholdyng vnto them (thinke you) in that thei woulde ſo charitablye vnburden thē of ſo great a part of their weighty liuynges, and laie the burden on their owne backes, and ſhoulders? Is not the Clergye, muche beeholdynge vnto theym, in that theie woulde (paſſynge the commune Order of Charitie,) preferre the clergy before them

ſelues, would helpe the clergie to heauen firſt, and tary behind themſelues, comyng after by leiſure, whē thei may intende it? But would any ſuche of the laitie be contēt (wyn you) to haue any pointe of like charitie extē
               ded towardes them again? would the
                  •
                be content, other ſhold helpe them to Heauen by like waies▪ by vnburdenyng theim of any part of their weighty poſeſſions, and liuelyhodde? It is not to bee thought in no wyſe. Wherefore, (the righte order of charitie ſtāding as it doth, that euery man ought to doe, as hee would bee doen vnto) ſithen the laitie would not, nor could not be content, after ſuche ſorte, to be vſed themſelues, their owne conſcience muſt nedes condēne

theim, of theire vncharitable, and vniuſt vſage towardes the clergie. What ſhall I ſaie again of certeine of the clergie, which ought to haue ben as lanternes of light▪ in geuing good exāple of chaſtitie & purety of lyfeto al other, hathe they doen godly, & well (trowe you) in breakynge their vowes, & in geuing therein ſuche an offēce to the world, that al the whole ordre of preſt hode hireth the worſſe for their doinges, & is in a maner ſlaundred therby? But here perhaps ſome wil replie again, and ſaie, fyrſte, that we ſecular prieſtes are no votaries, dooe make no vowe of chaſtitie at all, becauſe we hold our peace. Secondarily that we oughte not to make any vowe of chaſtitie, becauſe

(thei ſaie) it cannot be gathered of ſcripture. Thirdly y• wee can not kepe the vowe of Chaſtitie, becauſe thei demeth it impoſſible. Fourthly that the breache of the vowe of Chaſtitie is no offence, becauſe it ſeemeth vnto theym as a raſhe vowe.
