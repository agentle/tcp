But alakke the whyle we foūde ſone after / that the falſhed and malyce of the man / preued y• dyuyll trewe.

            ¶He deuyſeth a pytuouſe byll of complaynte and ſupplycacyon /  fayned to be by the pore ſykke and ſore beggers put vpp to the kyng /  lamentyng theryn theyre nomber ſo ſore encreaced / that good folkes
 almoyſe not half ſuffyſyng to fynde them mete / they be conſtraynyd heuely to dye for hunger. Then layth he y• cauſe of all theſe pore beggars /  both theyr encreſe in nomber & theyr defaut in fyndyng / all this he layth to the onely faut of the clergy: namyng them in hys bederoll byſhops / abbotꝭ / pryours / deacons / archedecōs / ſuffragans / preſtꝭ /  monkys / chanons / frerys / ꝑdoners / & ſōmoners. All theſe he calleth myghty ſturdy beggars & ydle holy theuys / whych he ſayth hath beggyd ſo importunatly / that they haue gotten in to theyr handys y• thyrd parte of all the realm of Englond / beſyde tythys / preuy tythys / probatys of teſtamentꝭ & offryngꝭ / wyth maſſe pens & mortuaryes / blyſſyng & curſyng / cytyng / ſuſpendyng & ſoylyng. Then cūmeth he pertyculerly to freres: to whom he maketh as he thynketh a playn & opē rekenyng / that they reſeyue by beggyng thorow ye realm yerely .xliii. thouſand .iii.Cxxxiii. pound .vi.s.viii.d. ſterlyng. Then ſhewyth he that all thys caſt to gyther / amounteth yerely farre aboue the half of the hole ſubſtaūce of the realme. After this preſuppoſyng as though he had prouyd yt that the clergy hath the half / he thē to proue the two hundred parte of that they haue were more then ſuffycyent for them: taketh for hys ground that yf the nomber of them be compared wyth the nomber of lay men / the clergy be not ye hundreth parte: & y• yf they be cōpared wyth the lay men women & children / the clergy vs not thē the foure hūdred ꝑſon of that nomber. And then entendyth he therby to proue & conclude / that ſyth they haue as he ſayth more then the half of all to gether / & be them ſelf
                  •
                not fully the foure hundred parte: therfore if that better half that they haue were deuyded into two hūdreth partꝭ / then were yet one parte of thoſe two hundreth ꝑtys as he thynketh to mych for them / ſpecyally becauſe they labour not. After thys he gathereth a great hepe of euyls / wherwyth he belyeth the clergy /  to bryng them in dyſpleaſure of the kynge and hatered of the people. And leſte men ſhuld eny thyng eſteeme the clergye for the ſuffragys of theyre pr

               youre in relyefe of vs ſely cryſten ſowlys in purgatory /  to take a way that good mynde oute of good cryſten mennys hartes /  he laboreth to make the worlde wene that there were no purgatorye at all. Wherein when he hathe done what he canne / then laboureth he to the kynge for a lycence to rayle vppon the clergye: ſayeng that there ys none other effectuall remedye agaynſte theym / but that yt myght pleaſe the kynge to gyue hym and ſuche other fre lycenſe and lyberte / to dyffame the clergy at theyr pleaſure amonge the people. For he ſayth that yf any of them be punyſhed any thyng by the temporall lawes / than they ſore troble the laborers therof by the ſpyrytuall law / and then the heddys of the clergy do ſo hyghly more than recompence the loſſe of theyre felows / that they may be bolde to do the lyke offēce agayn at theyr pleaſure. And for to proue that yt ys alway ſo / 
 he layth that yt hath bene ſo thryfe: and as yt ſhall after be ſhewed he lyeth in all thre. The furſte he layth that the byſhop of London was in a grete rage for endyghtynge of certayn curatys of extorcyon and incontynency the laſt yere in the wardmote queſtis. And for the ſecōd he laith that doctour Aleyn after that he was puniſhed by premunire for his cōtempt commytted agaynſt the kyngys temporall law / was therfore by the byſhoppys hyghly recōpēſed in benefyces. And for y• third he layth that Richard Hunne becauſe he had ſued a premunire agaynſt a preeſt for ſuyng hym in y• ſpyrytuall court in a mater determynable in the kyngys court / was accuſed of hereſy and commytted to byſhoppys pryſō: where he ſayth that all the world knowyth that he was murtheryd by doctour Horſey wyth his complyces then the byſhoppys chauncellour. And that y• ſame doctour Horſey he ſayth vppon other mennys mouthis payed .vi. hundred poūdes for hym & hys complyces: & after obteyned the kyngys moſt gracyous pardon. Wheruppō he ſayth the captayns of the ſpyrytualte becauſe he had faughten ſo manfully agaynſt the kyngꝭ crown and dygnyte / promotyd hym forth wyth benefyce vppō benefyce to the valew of .iiii. tymes as myche. And by theſe enſaumples he cōcludyth there wyll no ſuch punyſhment ſerue agaynſt the ſpyritualte: and alſo who y• iuſtly punyſh a preeſt by the temporall law / ys vniuſtly trobled agayn in y• ſpyrytuall law. Wherof he wold include that of neceſſyte for a ſpecyall remedy / the kyng muſt nedis graūt a ſicence to ſuch lewd felows to 
                  •
               ayle vppon thē. Thā cometh he at laſte vnto the deuyce of ſome remedy for the pore beggars. Wherin he wold in no wyſe haue none hoſpytals made / becauſe he ſayth that therin the profyte goeth to the preſtys. What remedy than for the pore beggars. He deuyſyth nor deſyreth nothynge to be geuen them / nor none other almoyſe or helpe requyreth for thē: but onely that y• kyngis hyghnes would furſt take frome the hole clergye all theyre hole lyuynge / and then ſette theym abrode in the worlde to gette theym wyues / and to get theyre lyuyng wyth y• labour of theyr handys and in the ſwete of theyr facys / as he ſayeth yt ys the cōmaundement of god in the furſt chapiter of Geneſis: and fynally to tay them to the car
                  •
               es to be whyppyd naked about euery market towne tyll they fall to labour. And then yf theſe petycions were onys arauntyd and parformyd / he ſheweth many great cō
               modytees that wold as he ſayth enſue theruppō / both to the kynge & the people / and to the pore beggars. Which thyngys we ſhall ere we leue / in ſuch wyſe repete and ponder / that your wyſdoms may conſyder and parceiue in your ſelf / what good frute wold folow the ſpede of hys goodly ſupplycacion / whereof we haue reherſed you the hole ſome and effect.
            ¶Trewthe yt ys y• many thyngys wherewyth he floryſheth hys

And thā ſhall we peruſe hys prouys / and in ſuch wyſe conſyder euery thynge aparte / that we nothyng dout but who ſo ſhall rede hys worſhypfull wrytyng after / ſhall ſone parceyue therin / floryſhyng without frute /  futtelte wythout ſubſtaūce / rethoryk wythout reaſō / bolde babelyng wythout lernyng / & wylynes wythout wyt. And fynally for y• foundacyon and ground of all hys prouys: ye ſhall fynde in hys boke not half ſo many leuys as lyes / but almoſt as many lyes as lynes.
            ¶And albe yt we lye here in that caſe that about thexamynacyō and anſweryng of ſuch a mad malycyouſe boke we haue neyther luſt nor leyſoure to beſtow the tyme / wherof miſpēt in our lyfe we geue now an hard and a heuy rekenynge: yet not only the neceſſyte of our cauſe dryueth vs to declare vnto you the feblenes of hys reaſons / wherewyth he wold bryng you in the caſe to care nothyng for vs / beleuyng yt there were no purgatory / but alſo moſt ſpecyally dothe our charite towarde you / ſtyrre vs to ſhew you the myſchefe that he myndeth to your ſelf / aſwell in that poynt of infidelyte / as in all the remnaunt of hys ſedicyouſe boke. In anſweryng wherof we wold gladly let hys foly and lak of lernyng paſſe / yf yt were not more thā neceſſary / that all folk ſhuld parceyue hys lyttell lernyng and leſſe wyt / leſt ſymple folk wenyng hym wyſe and well lernyd / myght vnto theyr harm eſteme hys euyll wrytyng the better for theyr wronge opynyon of hys wyt and lernyng. As for hys malycyouſe mynde and vntreuth / there can no man loke that we ſhuld leue vnto wchyd / but he that wold rather the man were beleued than anſweryd / and wold wyſh hys byll ſped were yt neuer ſo malycyouſe and falſe.
            ¶For where he to deuyſeth hys introduccyon / as all hys purpoſe ſhuld haue a great face of charyte / by that he ſpeketh all in the name of the pore beggars / thys ys nothyng els but the deuyls dryft / alway coueryng hys poyſon vnder ſome taſt of ſuger. As for vs we truſte there wyll no wyſe mā doute what fauour we bere to beggers as folk of theyr own felyſhyp and faculte / and of all whom / there be no where in the world nether ſo nedy nor ſo ſore / and ſo ſyk nor ſo impotent /  and ſo ſore in paynes as we. And that ſo farforth that yf ye myght ſe them all on the tone ſyde / and but one of vs on the tother ſyde / we be very ſure that the world wolde pyte one of vs / more thā them all. But although we be more beggars then your beggers be /  as folk dayly beggyng our almes of you and them both: yet ēuy we not them as one of them dothe a nother / but we pray and require you to gyue them for our ſakes / wherby your gyft gretly cumfortyth vs both. And they be alſo our proctours and beg in our name / and in our
 name receaue your money / wherof we receyue both your deuocyon and theyr prayours. So yt ye may be well aſſured / there coud be put no byll nor ſupplycacyon forth for theyr aduaūtage / whych we wold in eny wyſe hynder / but very gladly forther in all y• euer we myghte. But in good fayth as our pore brethern the beggars be for many cauſes greatly to be pytyed for theyr dyſeaſe and ſyknes / ſorow / payn & pouerte: ſo do we mych in thys caſe ſorow theyre myſhap / that they haue nott had at the leſte wyſe ſo muche fortune / as to fall vppon a wyſer ſcryuener to make theyr ſupplycacyon: but vppon ſuch a one as vnder hys great wylynes ſheweth ſo lyttell wyt / that begynnyng wyth a cloke of charyte / doth by and by no leſſe dyſcloſe hys hatered and malice / than yf be nothyng els had entēded / but to caſt of yt cloke and ſet out hys malyce naked to the ſhew. Whyrin lyke a beggars ꝓctour he goeth forth ſo nakedly / yt no begger ys there ſo bare of cloth or money / as he ſheweth hym ſelfe bare of faythe / lernynge / trouth /  wyt or charite. Whych thyng as it all redy well appereth to wyſe mē: ſo wyll we make yt euydent to all men / takyng our bygynnynge at the declaracyon of hys vntrewth: whych one thyng well perceyued /  w

But of ſo many we ſhall pray you take pacyence whyle we ſhewe you ſome / and ſuch as for the matter be requyſyte to be knowen / for as much as all hys proues be ſpecyally grounded vppon them.
            ¶And furſt to begyn where he begynneth / whē he ſayth that the nō
               ber of ſuch beggars as he pretendeth to ſpeke for / that is as hym ſelf calleth them the wretched hyduouſe monſters / on whō he ſayth ſcarcely eny eye dare loke / the foule vnhappy ſort of lepers & other ſore people / nedy / impotēt / blynde / lame and ſyh / lyuyng onely of almes: haue theyre numbere nowe ſo ſore encreaſed / that all the almoyſe of all the well dyſpoſed people of the realme ys nott halfe inowghe to ſuſtayne theym / but that for very conſtraynte they dye for hunger: vnto all thoſe wordys of hys / were yt not that though we well wyſt our ſelf he ſayd vntrew / yet wold we be lothe ſo to lay as a lye to his charge eny thyng / wherof the vntrewth were not ſo playnly parceyued /  but that he myghte fynde ſome fauourers whych myghte ſay he ſayd trew: els wold we paraduēture not let to tell hym / that for a bygynnyng in theſe few wordes he had wrytten two lyes at onys. If we ſhuld tell you what nōber ther was of pore ſyk folke in days paſſed iōg before your tyme: ye were at lyberte not to beleue vs. How be yt he cānot not yet on y• tother ſyde for hys part nether / bryng you forth a bederoll of theyr namys: wherfore we muſt for bothe our ꝑtꝭ
 be fayn to remyt you to your owne tyme / & yet not frō your chyldhed (whereof many thynges men forget when they come to farr greater age) but vnto the days of your good remēbraunce. And ſo doyng / we ſuppoſe yf the ſory ſyghtys yt mē haue ſene / had left as gret impreſſyon ſtyll remaynyng in theyr hartys / as the ſyght maketh of the preſēt ſorow that they ſe: men ſhuld thynk & ſay yt they haue in days paſſed ſene as many ſykke beggers as they ſe now. For as for other ſyknes they rayn not god be thanked but after ſuch rate as they haue done in tymes paſſed. And thē of the frēch pokkys .xxx. yere ago went there about ſyk / fyue agaynſt one yt beggeth wyth them now. Wherof who ſo lyſt to ſay that he ſeeth it otherwyſe: we wyll hold no great dyſpycyons wyth hym theruppon / becauſe we lakke the namys of both the ſydes to make the tryall wyth. But ſurely who ſo ſhall ſay the cōtrary: ſhall as we ſuppoſe eyther ſaye ſo for his pleaſure / or els ſhall it fare by his ſight as folkis fare with theyr felyng / which what they fele they whyne at / but what they haue felt the

                haue more then half forgotten / though they felt it ryght late. Whych maketh one that hath but a pore boyle vppon hys fynger / thynk the grefe more great / than was the payne of a great boch that greued hys hole hād lyttell more than a moneth a fore. So that in thys poynt of the nomber of ſyk beggers ſo ſore encreaſed ſo late / albeit we wyll forbere ſo to ſay to hym as we mighte well ſay: yet will we be ſo bolde to denye it hym till he bryng in ſome better thyng than hys bare word for the profe.
            ¶And in good faith if he be put to the profe of the tother poynt alſo /  that is to wyt that for very conſtraynt thoſe pore ſyk folk dye for hū
               ger: we verely truſt & think he ſhall ſeke farr and fynde very few yf he fynde any at all: For albeit that pore houſeholders haue theſe d

            ¶Now where as he ſayth that the almes of all well diſpoſed peple of thys reame is not half inough to ſuſtayn them / and the well dyſpoſed people he calleth in this matter all thē that gyueth them almoyſe /  & he ſpeketh not of one yere nor twayn but of theſe many yerys now paſſed / for neyther be the nomber of the clergy nor theyr poſſeſſyons nor the freres almes in whych thyngꝭ he layeth the cauſe why the almes of good people ys not half ſuffycyent to kepe & ſuſtayn the pore and ſyk beggers fro famyſhyng / any great thynge encreaſed in theſe x. or .xii. or .xx. yeres laſt paſſed / & therfore yf that he ſayd were trew: then by all theſe .x. yeres at the leſt / the almoyſe of good people hath not bene half able to ſuſteyn the pore & ſyk beggers frō famyſhynge. And ſurely yf that were ſo that in .iiii. or .v. yerys in which was plenty of corne / the pore & ſyk beggars for lak of mennys almes died ſo faſt

If thys man were here matched wyth ſome ſuche as he ys hym ſelfe / that hathe the eloquence that he hath that coulde fynde out ſuche comely fygures of retoryque as he fyndeth ſette forthe and furnyſhed wyth ſuche vehement wordes as he thundreth owte lyke thunder blaſtys / that hathe no leſſe maters in hys mouth than the greate brode botomleſſe occean ſee full of euyls /  the wekenes and dulnes of the kynges ſwerde / the tranſlacyon of y• kyngys kyngdome / the ruyne of the kynges crowne / wyth greate exclamacyons / Oh greuouſe and paynfull exaccyons / oh cauſe moſt horryble oh greuouſe ſhyp wracke of the comen welth: what myght one that had ſuche lyke eloquence ſaye here to hym? ſurely ſo myche and in ſuche wyſe as we ſely poore pewlyng ſowles neyther can deuyſe nor vtter. But verely two or thre thynges we ſe and maye well ſaye that neyther be theſe greate maters mete for the mouthe of the beggers proctour / nor ſuche prechyng of reformacyon and amēdemēt of the world mete maters for hym to medle wyth / whych wyth open hereſyes and playne peſtylent errors / beſely goeth aboute to poyſon and infecte the worlde: nor very conuenyent for hym to take vppon hym to gyue counſayle to a kynge / when he ſheweth hym ſelf to haue ſo moche preſumpcyon and ſo lytell wytt / as to aſke the kyng a queſtyon and appoynte hym hys anſwer: and therin to tell hym that all y• worlde knoweth that thynge to be trew / whych the kynge hathe hym ſelfe all redy by hys atturney and hys iudges in open iugement / and in hys hygh courte of recorde teſtefyed & confeſſed for falſe. If that man were not for malyce as mad not as marche hare / but as a madde dogge that rūneth forth and ſnatcheth he ſeeth not at whome: the felowe could neuer elles wyth ſuche open foly ſo ſodenly ouer ſe hym

But yt were wrong wyth the worlde yf malyce had as myche wytte / cyrcumſpeccyon and prouydence in the purſute of an vngracyouſe purpoſe / as yt hath haſt / yuell wyll and wylyneſſe in the fyrſt in terpryſynge. For as an ape hath ſome ſymylytude of a man / and as a fox hath a certayne wylyneſſe ſomewhat reſemblyng an vnperfayte wytte: ſo fareth thys felowe / that begynneth as one wolde wene at good zeale and cheryte borne towarde the poore beggers.

And where as he wold in y• begynnynge by y• towchyng of great maters / fayne ſeme very wyſe: wyth in a whyle in the progreſſe he proueth hym ſelf a very ſtark fole. And where he wolde ſeme to ſhewe many notable thynges whych no man had marked but he / he prouydeth wyſely that no mā may beleue hym he maketh ſo many lyes / and all that euer he dothe ferther / he buyldeth vppon the ſame.
            ¶He layeth that the lyuynge whych the clergye hathe ys the onely cauſe that there be ſo many beggers that be ſyk and ſore. Very well and wyſely / as though the clergye by theyre ſubſtaunce made men blynde and lame. The clergye alſo ys the cauſe he ſayth why they dye for hunger / as thoughe euery lay man gaue to beggers all that euer he coulde / and the clergye gyue them neuer a grote: & as though there wolde not mo beggers walke a brode yf the clergye lefte of ſuche lay men as they fynde.
            ¶But he proueth you that the clergy muſt nedys be the cauſe why there be ſo many poore men and beggers. For he ſayth that before the clergy came in theyr were but few pore people: and yet they beggyd not neyther / but men he ſayth gaue them ynough vnaſked. But now where ſa
                  ••
               he whē he ſaw the people gyue pore folke ſo faſt theyr allmes vnaſked y• no man neded to beg before the clergy began. Thys man of lyklyhod ys of grete age / & or ere y• clergy began was wonte to ſyt at ſaynt Sauours wyth a ſore leg: but he beggyd not mē gaue hym ſo mych vnaſked. For where as he alledgyth the byble for hym in the actes of the appoſtles / verely we meruayll mych what the mā meneth. For there he may ſe that the apoſtels and the deacons whych were then the clergy / had all to gyther in there own handys / & dyſtrybuted to euery man as them ſelf thought good. And therfore we wonder what he meaneth to ſpeke of that boke. For we thynke that he meneth not to hurt the clergy ſo now / as to put all in to theyr handꝭ. And ſurely but yf he meane ſo / els ys thys place nothīg for hys purpoſe. ¶Now herein he ſheweth alſo an hygh poynt of hys wyt / where he ſayth that the greate lyuyng that the clergy hath / whyche he layeth & lyeth to be more then half of the hole reuenews and ſubſtaunce of the
 realme: ys ſhyfted among fewer then the foure hundreth part of the people. As though y• of the clergyes parte there had no lay people theyr lyuyng / no ſeruaunt eny wagys / none artyfycer eny money for workyng / no carpenter no maſyn eny money for byldyng: but all the money that euer cūmeth in theyr handes / they put yt by & by in theyre own belyes / and no lay man hath eny relyef therof. And therfor thys poynt was wyſely wrytten ye ſe as well as we. Now for the trouthe therof / yf yt were trew that he ſayth / that the clergy compared to the reſydew of the men onely / be not one to an .C. then ſhall ye not nede to fere y• greate Turke and he cam to morow / except ye ſuffer amōg you to grow in great nomber theſe Lutherans that fauoure hym. For we dare make you the warantyſe that yf hys lye be true / there be mo men a greate meany in Londō and wythin .iiii. ſhyres next adioynyng /  than the great Turk bryngeth in to Hungary. But in thys ye muſt hold hī excuſed / for he medleth not mych wyth angry in to ſe to what ſūme the nōber of men aryſeth that ys multyplyed by an .C. All hys practyſe in multyplycacyon medleth wyth nothyng but lyes: & therin mache hym wyth whō ye wyll / he wyll gyue you a .C. for one. wherof yf ye lack let thys be the ſāple y• he ſayth / yf thabbot of weſtmynſter ſhuld ſyng euery day as many maſſes for hys foūders as he ys boūdē to do by hys foūdacyō.

He knoweth what ys euery mannes dutye ſaue hys owne. He ys mete to be a beggers proctour / that can ſoo proll aboute and can tell all thynge.
            ¶But now were all his payntyd ꝓces ye wot well nothing worth /  but yf he deuyſed agaynſte all theſe myſcheues ſome good and holſō help. It ys therfore a world to ſe what polytyke deuyces he fyndeth agaynſt y• great brode botomleſſe occean ſee of euyls: what remedyes to repayre the ruyne of the kyngys crown: to reſtore and vphold hys honour and dygnyte: to make hys ſwerd ſharp and ſtrong: & fynally to ſaue all the ſhyp wrak of the comen welth. ye wolde peraduenture wene y• the man wolde now deuyſe ſō good holſome lawes for helpe of all theſe maters. Nay he wyll none therof. For he ſayth he douteth that the kyng ys not able to make any law agaynſt them. For he ſayth that the clergy ys ſtronger in the parliament than the kyng hym ſelf. For in the hygher houſe / he rekenyth that the ſpyrytualte ys more in nomber and ſtronger than the temporalte. And in the comen houſe he ſayth that all the lerned men of the realme except the kynges lerned councell / be feed wyth the church to ſpeke agaynſt the kynges crown and dygnyte in the parlyamēt for theym: and therfore he thynketh the kynge vnable to make eny law agaynſt the fawtys of the clergye.
            
                ¶Thys beggars ꝓctour wold fayn ſhew hym ſelf a man of great experyence / and one that had great knowlege of the maner & order vſed in the kyngys parlyamētys. But than he ſpeketh ſo ſauourly herof: that yt well apperyth of hys wyſe wordꝭ he neyther canneth eny ſkyll therof / nor neuer cā in the houſe. For as for y• hygher houſe furſt y• kyngꝭ own ryall parſon alone more than coūterpayſyth all y• lordys ſpyrytuall preſent wyth hym and the temporyll to. And ouer thys the ſpyrytual lordys can neuer in nomber excede the lordys temporall /  but muſt nedys be farre vnderneth thē yf yt pleaſe the kyng. For hys hyghnes may call thyder by hys wryt many mo tēporall lordys at hys own pleaſure. And beyng as they be / there was neuer yet ſene that the ſpyrytuall lordes bendyd them ſelfe there as a partye agaynſt the temporall lordes. But yt hath bene ſene that the thynge whych the ſpyrytuall lordes haue moued and thought reſonable / the temporall lordes haue denyed & refuſed: as appereth vppon the mocyon made for legytymacyō of the chyldrē borne before the maryage of theyr parentys. Wherin albe yt yt the reformacyon whych the lordꝭ ſpyrytuall moued / was a thyng that nothyng partayned to ther awn commodyte / and albe yt that they layed alſo for theyr parte the conſtytucyon and ordynaunce of the church and the lawes of other cryſten cuntrees: yet could they not obtayne agaynſt the lordes temporall that nothynge alleged to the contrary but theyre owne wylles.
            And therfor in the hygher houſe the ſpyrytuall parte neuer apperyd yet ſo ſtrong / that they myght ouer matche the temporall lordes. And then how mych ar they to feble for them and the kyng to / whoſe hyghnes alone ys ouer ſtrong for thē both / & may by hys wryt call to hys parlyamēt mo temporall lordes whan he wyll. Now where he ſayth y• in the comen houſe all the lerned men of the realme ar feed to ſpeke for the clergy except the kynges lerned counſell: there be .ii. folyes at ones. For neyther be all the lernyd men of the realme knyghtes or burgeyſes in the comen houſe / and the kyngys lerned coūcell ys not there at all. And therfore yt ſemeth that he hath hard ſumwhat of ſū men that had ſene as lytell as hym ſelf. And ſurely yf he had bene in the comen houſe as ſome of vs haue bene: he ſhuld haue ſene the ſpyrytualte nat gladly ſpoken for. And we lytell dout but that ye remember actes and ſtatutes paſſyd at ſōdry parlyamētes / ſuche and in ſuch wyſe & ſome of them ſo late / as your ſelf may ſe that eyther y• clergy ys not the ſtrenger ꝑte in the kyngꝭ ꝑlyement / or elles haue no mynd to ſtryue. And for the ferther profe that the kynges hyghnes ys not ſo weke & vnable in hys owne parlyamēt as thys beggers proctour ſo preſumptuouſly telleth hym / hys grace well knowyth and all hys people to / y• in theyr own conuocacyons hys grace neuer deuyſed nor deſyred any thyng in hys lyfe / y• euer was denyed hym. And therfore thys gay inuencyō of thys beggers proctour / y• he fayneth the kyngꝭ
 hyghnes to be in hys hygh courte of parlyament more weke and feble then the clergye / ys a feble deuyce.
            ¶But now ſyth he wyll haue no law deuyſed for the remedy of his greate complayntes / what helpe hath he deuyſed els. The helpe of all thys gere ys he ſayth none other thing / but to lett hym & ſuche ryall raylers rayle & geſt vppō the church / and tell the people y• preſtꝭ fawtes: and for the lewdnes of parte / brynge y• hole clergy in cōtēpt and hatered amonge all the temporall folke. Whych thyng he ſayth y• kyng muſt nedes ſuffer / yf he wyll eſchew the ruyne of hys crowne 
                  •
                dygnyce / And thys thyng he ſayth ſhalbe more ſpedefull & effectuall in the matter / than all the lawes that euer can be made be they neuer to ſtrōg. Lo good lordys & maſters then ſhall ye nede no mo parlyamēt ys. For here ys god be thankyd an eaſye way wyſely founden to remedye wythe raylynge the greate brode botomleſſe occean ſe of yuels and to ſaue the comen weale frome ſhyp wracke / & the kynges crowne from ruyne.
            ¶But now to the poore beggers. what remedy fyndeth theyr proctour for therto make hoſpytals? Nay ware of yt / therof he wyll none in no wyſe. For therof he ſayth the mo y• worſe / becauſe they be ꝓfytable to preſtꝭ what remedy thā? Gyue thē any money? Nay nay not a grot
                  •
               . what other thyng thē? Nothyng in y• world wyll ſerue but this that yf y• kynges grace wyll byld a ſure hoſpytall y• neuer ſhall fayle to releue all the ſycke beggers for euer / let hym gyue nothynge to thē but loke what the clergye hath & take all that from them. Is nott here a goodly myſchef for a remedy? Is not thys a ryall feſt to leue theſe beggers meteles / and then ſend mo to dyner to theym? Oh the wyſe. Here want we voyce and eloquēce to ſet out an exclamacyon in the prayſe and commendacyon of thys ſpecyall hygh prouyſyon.
            Thys byll putteth he forth in the poore beggers name. But we verely thynk yf them ſelf haue as myche wyt as their proctour lacketh /  they had leuer ſee theyr byll maker burned / then theyr ſupplycacyon ſped. For they may ſone ꝑceyue that he myndeth nor theyr almoyſe /  but onely the ſpoyle of the clergye. For ſo that the clergye leſe yt: he neyther deuyſeth ferther / nor ferther forcyth who haue yt.
            ¶But yt ys ethe to ſe wherof ſpryngeth all hys dyſpleaſure. He ys angry & fretyth at the ſpyrytuall iuryſdyccyon for the ponyſhmēt of heretykes and burnyng of theyr erronyouſe bokes: for euer vppō that ſtryng he harpeth: very angry wyth the burnyng of Tyndals teſtament. For theſe matters he calleth them blood ſuppers dronken in the blood of holy ſayntes and marters. ye merueyll paraduenture which holy ſayntes & martyrs he menyth. Surely by hys holy ſayntꝭ and marters he meanyth theyr holy ſcyſmatykes and heretykes / for whoſe iuſt ponyſhment theſe folk that ar of y• ſame ſect / fume / frete / 
 frote and fome / as fyerce and as angerly as a new huntyd ſow. And for the rācour conceyuyd vppon this dyſpleſure / cometh vp all hys cōplaynt of the poſſeſſyons of the clergye. Wheryn he ſpareth & forbereth the nūnys yet / becauſe they haue no iuriſdyccyon vppon heretykys: for els he wold haue cryed out vppō theyr poſſeſſyōs to. But thys ys now no new thyng nor yt furſte tyme yt heretykes haue bene in hād wyth the mater. For furſte was there in the .xi. yere of kynge Henry the fourth / one Ihān Badby burned for hereſy.

            ¶Now to thentent yt ye may yet farther parceyue and ſe y• they by the dyſtruccyon of the clergy / meane the clere abolycyon of Cryſtys fayth: yt may lyke you to conferre and compare to gether .ii. placis of hys beggars byll. In one place after that he hath heped vp to gether all hys lyes agaynſt the hole clergy / & therto adioyned hys greuouſe exclamacyon: Oh y• greuouſe ſhypwrak of the comē weale: he ſayth that in aūcyent tyme before the comyng of the clergy / there were but few pore people & yet they dyd not beg / but there was gyuen them ynogh vnaſked / becauſe at yt tyme he ſayth there was no clergy (whō he calleth alway rauenouſe woluys) to aſk yt fro thē: and thys ſayth he appereth in y• boke of the actys of y• apoſtles. In this place we let paſſe hys threfold foly. One that he wold by that there were no beggars in one place / proue therby that there were none in all y• worlde beſyde. For as he for lakke of wyt and vnderſtandyng myſtaketh the booke / he weneth that there were none that beggyd in Hyeruſalem.
 whych yf yt were trew / yet myghte there be ynow in other placys.
            A nother of hys folyes is in that he alledgeth a boke for hym that no thyng proueth hys purpoſe. For in all that hole boke ſhall he neyther fynde that there was at that tyme few pore peple / nor yt pore peple at that tyme begged not. Far of trouthe there were pore people and beggers /  ydle people / and theues to / good plenty bothe then and all way byfore / ſynnes almoſte as longe as Noes flode / and yet peraduenture ſeuen yere afore that to. And ſo were there in dede in Heyruſalē alſo amonge theym all / tyll cryſtendome came in / and yet remayned then amonge ſuch peple there as tourned not to the fayth of Cryſt. The thyrde foly ys / he layeth that boke for hym whyche in dede preueth playne agaynſt hym. For where he ſayeth yt appereth there that the clergy was not then come / we can not in y• worlde deuyſe of what people he ſpeketh Paynyms / Iewes / or cryſten men. If he meane amonge Paynyms / hys folye and hys falſehed both ys to euydent. For who knoweth not that amonge the Paynyms they had aL way theyre preeſtys / whoſe lyuynge was well and plentuouſly prouyded for / as ye may perceyue not onely by many other ſtoryes / but alſo by many places in the byble / and ſpecyally in the .xlvii. chapyter of geneſys. If he ſpeke of the Iewes / euery mā woteth well that they had a clergy thouſandꝭ of yeres bifore the boke that he alledgeth / & theyr lyuynge farre more largely prouyded for / then eny parte of ye people byſyde / and that by goddys awne ordynaunce. Now yf he ſpeke of y• cryſten people that was at that tyme in Hieruſalem where y• fayeth byganne / hys boke maketh ſore agaynſt hym. For there was a clergy as ſone as there was eny chryſten peple. For the clergy byganne thē. And that clergye had not a parte of the cryſten peples ſubſtaūce / but had yt all to gether / and dyd dyſtrybute yt as they ſawe nede / whych no man dowteth but that the partyes ſhewed theym / or ellys in ſome nedys they muſt nedys haue laked. So that here were many pore mē yf they be pore that haue naught left / & all they beggers / yf they be beggers that be fayne to ſhew theyr nede and aſke / and y• clergy had all to gyther. And yet layeth this wyſe mā thys boke for hym / beyng ſuche as yf he ſhulde haue ſytten and ſtudyed therfore / he could not haue founden a boke that made more agaynſt hym.
            ¶But as we ſayed byfore / we ſhall lette hys falſe foly paſſe / and praye you to cōſyder what he wold haue you byleue. He ſayeth and wold ye ſhuld wene that there were few pore folke / and no beggers no where byfore y• clergy of cryſtēdom cā in / but that all y• pouerte & beggary cā in to y• world wyth the criſtē clergy. Now knoweth euery man y• the cryſten clergy & the cryſten fayth / cam in to the cryſten people to gether / ſo that in effecte hys wordys way to thys y• all pouerte and beggary came in to the worlde wyth the cryſten fayth.
            
                ¶Sette nowe to thys place the tother place of hys in the ende and concluſyon of hys boke / where he ſayth that after the clergy ſpoylyd onys and caſt out / then ſhall the goſpell be preched / and thē ſhall we beggars haue ynough & more: lo lyke as in the tone place he ſheweth that all begary cam in wyth y• clergy yt brought in ye fayth / ſo ſheweth be in the tother that there ſhuld wyth the clergy all beggary go forth agayn / yf they were ſo clene caſt out that Criſtys goſpell beyng caſt out wyth them / and the fayth whych cam in wyth them / they myghte haue that goſpell prechid as they ſay they ſhulde and as in dede they ſhuld whych they call the goſpell / that is to wit Luthers goſpell and Tyndallys teſtament / prechynge the dyſtruccyon of Cryſtys very fayth & hys holy ſacramentꝭ / auauncyng & ſettyng forth all boldenes of ſynne & wrechydnes / and vnder the falſe name of cryſtē fredome /  ſpurryng forward the dyuylyſh vnbrydeled appetyte of lewd ſedycyouſe and rebellyouſe lyberte / that ſlew in one ſomer as we ſhewed you before aboue .lx.M. of y• pore vplādyſh Lutheranis in Almayn.

            ¶For of all that euer he hath ſayd / he hath not almoſt ſayd one trew word ſaue thys. And ſurely this word wold after theyr goſpell onys prechyd & receyuyd be foūden ouer trew. For thē ſhuld the beggers /  nat ſuch beggars as he ſemeth to ſpeke for that be ſyk ſore and lame /  but ſuch bold preſumptuouſe beggars as he ys in dede / hole & ſtrong in body but weke & ſyk in ſoule / yt haue theyr bodys clene fro ſkabbys and theyr ſoulys foule infect wyth vgly great pokkys & leprye: theſe beggars wold hope to haue & except good men take good hede wolde not fayle to haue ynough and a great deale more. For after that they myght the clergy furſt dyſtroyd bryng in onys after yt the prechyng of Luthers goſpell and Tyndals teſtament / and myght wyth theyr heryſyes and fals fayth infect and corrupt the people / cauſyng them to ſet the blyſſed ſacramentꝭ aſyde / to ſet holy days and faſtyng days at yought / to contemne all good workys / to geſt & rayle agaynſt holy vowed caſtyte / to blaſpheme the olde holy fathers and doctours of Criſtys church / to mok and ſcorne the blyſſed ſayntys and martyrs y• dyed for Cryſtys fayth / to reiect and refuſe y• fayth that thoſe holy martyrys lyued and dyed for / and in the ſtede of y• true fayth of cryſt contynued thys .xv.C. yeres / to take nowe the falſe fayth of a fond frere / of olde condemnyd and of new reforgyd wythyn ſo few days
 wyth contempte of god and all good men / and obſtynate rebellyouſe mynde agaynſt all lawes rule and gouernaunce / wyth arrogante preſumpcyon to medle wyth euery mannys ſubſtaunce / wyth euery mā
               nys lande / and euery mannys mater nothynge partaynynge to them: yt ys we ſay no dowte / but that ſuche bolde preſumptuouſe beggers wyll / yf ye loke not well to theyre handꝭ / not fayle to haue as he wryteth ynough and more to. For they ſhall gather to gyder at laſte / and aſſemble theym ſelfes in plumpes and in great rowtes / and from aſkynge fall to the takynge of theyre almoyſe theym ſelfe / and vnder pretexte of reformacyon (berynge euery man that aught hath / in hande that he hath to myche) ſhall aſſay to make newe dyuyſyon of euery mannys lande and ſubſtaunce: neuer ceacynge yf ye ſuffer theym /  tyll they make all beggers as they be theym ſelfe / and at laſte bryng all the realme to ruyne / and thys not wythout bochery and fowle blody handys.
            ¶And therfore this beggers proctour or rather the proctour of hell ſhuld haue concluded hys ſupplycacyon not vnder the maner that he hath done / that after the clergye caſte owte / thā ſhall the goſpell be preched: then ſhall beggers and bawdys decreace: thē ſhall ydle folk and theuys be fewer: then ſhall the realme encreace in rycheſſe and ſo forth. But he ſhuld haue ſayed: After that the clergye ys thus deſtroyed and caſte owt / then ſhall Luthers goſpell come in / then ſhall Tyndallys teſtament be taken vp: Thē ſhall falſe hereſyes be preched: Thē ſhall ye ſacramentꝭ be ſett ate nough: Thē ſhall faſtyng & prayour be neglected: Thē ſhall holy ſayntꝭ be blaſphemed: Then ſhall almyghty god be dyſpleaſed: Then ſhall he wythdrade hys grace and lette all rūne to ruyne: Then ſhall all vertue be hadde in deryſy

But perſeueryng in your olde fayth of criſte / and obſeruyng

            ¶And fyrſte yt ſemeth very probable and lykely / that y• good kyng Ezechias for none other cauſe wepte at the warnyng of hys deth geuen hym by the ꝓphete / but onely for the fere of purgatory. For albe yt that dyuers doctours alledge dyuers cauſes of hys heuynes and lothenes at that tyme to deꝑt and dye: yet ſemeth there none ſo lykly as the cauſe that auncyent doctours alledge / that ys to wyt y• he was lothe to dye for the fere of hys eſtate after hys deth / for as mych as he had offendyd god by ouermych lykyng of hym ſelf: wherwyth he wyſt y• god was dyſpleſyd wyth hym & gaue hym warnyng by the ꝓphete /  that he ſhuld lyue no lēger. Now cōſyderyd he ſo the weyght of hys offence / yt he thought and eſtemyd the onely loſſe of thys preſent lyfe farre vnder the iuſt & condygne ponyſhmēt therof / and therfore fell in gret drede of farre ſorer ponyſhmēt after. But beyng as he was a good faythfull kyng / he coud not lak ſure hope thorow hys repentaūce of ſuch forgyneues / as ſhold preſarue hym frō hell. But ſyth his time ſhuld be ſo ſhort yt he ſhuld haue no layſour to do penāce for hys faut: he therfore fered yt the remaūte of hys ryghtuouſe ponyſhment ſhuld be parformyd in purgatory. And therfore wept he tē
               derly & longyd to lyue lenger / that hys ſatyſfaccyon done there in the world in prayour & other good vertuouſe dedꝭ / might aboliſh & were out all the payn y• els were toward hym here among vs. To whych hys feruēt boone & deſyre at the cōtēplacyon of his penitēt hart / our lord of his hygh pyte cōdyſcended & grauntyd hym the lengthyng of hys lyfe for .xv. yerꝭ / makyng hym for his farther cūfort ſure therof by y• ſhew of a manyfeſt myracle. But wherto graūtid our lord y• lē
               ger lyfe / to be beſtowed vppō worldy delite and pleaſure? Nay nay verely. But to thentēt yt myght appere that it was of goddys great
 marer grauntyd for the redemyng of his purgatory by good workys for hys ſatyſfaccyon: he was ꝓmyſed by the prophete not onely y• he ſhuld wythin .iii. days be recouered and hole / but alſo that he ſhuld go in to the temple to pray. So that yt may therby appere for what end and entent he longed ſo ſore for a lenger lyfe.
            ¶Now yf the beggars proctour or Tyndale or Luther eyther / lyſt to ſay y• in thys poynt we do but geſſe at that good kyngꝭ mynde / and therfore purgatory therby rather ſūwhat reſoned thā well & ſurely prouyd: therto may we well anſwer and ſay / that the cyrcumſtaunce of the mater conſyderyd / wyth the vertuouſe holynes and cōnyng of ſuch as ſo longe ago haue taken the ſcrypture thus: y• place alone is a farr better profe for purgatory / thā euer eny of thē coud hetherto lay agaynſt yt yet. For albeyt thys beggars proctour ſayth y• ryght wyſe & cōnynge mē wyll ſay y• there ys no purgatory at all / by which wyſe men he menyth Luther and Tyndall & him ſelf: yet was there neuer any of theym all that yet layed anye ſubſtancyall thynge eyther reaſon or authorytye for theym / but onely geſte and rayle / and ſaye that purgatory ys a thyng of the popꝭ awne makynge / and that ſoulys do nothyng tyll domis day but lye ſtyll and ſlepe. And thus tellyng ſuch wyſe talys for theyre owne parte / and makyng mokkys and mowes at euery thyng that maketh agaynſt theyr foly for our parte: they go forth in theyre euyll wyll and obſtynacy / and with murmur & grudge of theyre owne conſyence / cōtent theym ſelfe wyth y• onely feding of theyre malycyouſe myndis by the encreace of theyre faccyon / of ſuch as fall in to theyre felyſhype rather of a lyght mynde and lewde pleaſure to taire a parte / then of eny greate credence that they gyue vnto theym or greately force whyche way they byleue. For ſurely yf theſe folke were reſonable and indyfferent as yt ys not well poſſyble for them to be / after that they refuſe onys to byleue y• catholyque church & in y• vnderſtandyng of ſcripture lene onely to theyre awne wyttys /  but ellys as we ſay yf they could wyth an equall & indyfferent mynd conſyder and way what they here: they ſhulde ſone ſe theyre hereſye reproued and purgatory ſurely cōfermed / not onely by probable reaſon taken of the ſcrypture as in y• place that we reherſed you of Ezechyas /  but alſo by playne and euydent textys.
            ¶For haue ye not the wordys of ſcrypture wryten in the boke of the kyngys: Dominus deducit ad inferos et reducit: our lord bryngeth folke downe in to hell and bryngeth theym thenſe agayne? But they yt be in that hell where the dāpned ſowlꝭ be: they be neuer delyuered thenſe agayne. Wherfore yt appereth well that they whom god delyuereth and bryngeth thēſe agayn / be in that part of hell that ys callyd purgatory.
            ¶What ſay they to the wordys of the ꝓphete zachary: Tu quoque
 in ſaguine teſtamenti tui eduxiſti vinctos tuos de lacu in quo non erat aqua: Thou haſt in the blode of thy teſtament brought out thy bounden pryſoners owte of the pyt or lake in whych there was no water. In that they whom the prophete there ſpeketh of were bounden / we may well perceyue that they were in 
                  •
                pryſon of punyſhement. And in that he calleth theym the pryſoners of god: yt ys eth to perceyue that he meaneth not eny that were takē and empryſoned by eny other than the dampned ſpyrytys the very gaolers of god. And in that he ſayth that there ys in that lake no water: we may well perceyue that he ſpake yt in deſcrypcyon of that drye pyt of fyre / where in there ys no refreſhyng: For as hote are we here as they are in hell. And what 
                  •
               ete ys in the pyt where there lakketh water: our ſauyour hym ſelfe declareth by the wordys of the rych gloton lyeng in ſuch a lake from whenſe at ſyght of pore Lazarus in Abrahams boſom / he deſyred heuely to haue hym ſent vnto hym wyth one droppe of water to refreſhe hys tonge / that after all the delycates that yt had taſted in his lyfe / lay there thē ſore burnyng / & neuer ſet half ſo mych by twenty tonne of wyne / as he ſet by one pore drop of water. So that as we ſhewe you / theſe wordys of y• ꝓphete zachary. Thou haſte brought owte thy boundē preſoners owte of the lake where in ys no water: do ryght well appere to be ſpokē of theſe pore ēpreſoned ſowlys whom cryſt after hys bytter paſſyon by hys precyouſe blode wherwyth he conſecrated hys church in hys newe teſtament / delyuered owt of the lake of fyre wherin they lay boundē for theyre ſynnys. But nowe ys there no man y• dowteth whyther cryſte delyuered the dāpned ſowlis owt of hell or not. For in y• hell ys there no redempcyon / & in limbo patrum the ſowlys were in reſte. Wherfore it appereth clerely that thoſe 
                  •
               ſoners whom he brought owte of theyre payne / he brought onely owte of purgatory: And ſo ſe theſe heretyques purgatory clerly proued by the playn wordys of thys holy prophete.
            ¶A nother place ys there alſo in the olde teſtament that putteh purgatory quyte owt of queſtyon. For what ys playnner then the places whych in the boke of the Machabees make mencyon / of the deuowt remembraūce / prayoure / almoyſe / & ſacryfyce / to be done for ſowlys when the good and holy man Iudas Machabeus gathered money among the peple to by ſacryfyce wythall to be offred vp for y• ſowlys of theym that were dede in the batayle. Doth not thys place of ſcrypture ſo openly declare the nede that we ſowlys haue in purgatorye / & the relyefe that we fynd by the prayour and ſuffragys of good peple vppon erthe / that all the heretyques that barke ſo faſte agaynſt vs /  can fynd neyther gloſe nor colour to the contrary?
            ¶What ſhyfte fynde they here? ſurely a very ſhameleſſe ſhyfte / and are fayne to take theym to that take lynge that ys theyre ſhote anker
 allway / when they fynde the ſtorme ſo great that they ſe theyr ſhyp goth all to wrekk. For firſt they vſe to ſet ſome falſe gloſe to the text that ys layed agaynſt theym / and deny the ryght ſenſe.
            ¶But now yf the texte be ſo playne that they can haue no ſuche colour: then when they can haue no more holde but ſe that theyre parte goth all to naught / they fall to a ſhameleſſe boldnes & let no to deny the ſcrypture and all / & ſay y• hole ſcrypture whych ys layd agaynſte them ys none holy ſcrypture at all / as Luther playth wyth the godly epyſtle of Cryſtys blyſſed apoſtle ſaynt Iamys. And euyn the ſame do thoſe heretykꝭ wyth the authoryte of this holy boke of Machabees: they be not aſhamed to ſay that yt ys not ſcrypture. But vppon what grownd do they deny yt for ſcrypture / becauſe yt is not found
                  •
                and accompted for holy ſcrypture among y• Iewys? They neyther do nor can deny but that yt ys taken for holy ſcripture by the churche of Cryſte. For yf they wold denye / that both the hole chyrche bereth wytnes agaynſt them at this day / & it alſo appereth playnly by ſaynt Hyerome / ſaynt Auſtayn / & other old holy doctours / that the church ſo toke yt alſo in theyr days & before: thē wold we gladly wit of theſe new men theſe enmyes we mean of ours / whyther the chyrch of criſt be not of as great authoryte and as mych to be beleuyd in the choyſe & eleccyō of holy ſcrypture as the Iewes. If they wyll ſay yes: thē anſwere they them ſelf: for then ys the boke of the Machabees by y• choyce of the chyrch prouyd holy ſcrypture though the Iewes neuer accounted yt ſo. Now yf they will ſay no / and wyll contend that yt cā
               not be accountyd holy ſcrypture though the chyrch of Cryſte ſo take take yt / but yf the Iewes ſo toke yt too: then go they nere to put out ſaynt Ihāns goſpell out of ſcrypture too / for the Iewes neuer toke yt for none. And ſurely yf they admyt for ſcripture that book that the Iewes admytted / & deny that boke to be ſcrypture whych the church of Cryſte receyueth for ſcrypture: thē do they ſay that the ſpyryte of god was more effectually preſent and aſſyſtēt vnto the ſynagoge of the Iewys in the law of hys prophete Moyſes / thē vnto the church of hys awne onely bygoten ſonne in the law of cryſtys goſpell.
            ¶If they conſyder well the bokꝭ of y• Machabeys / they ſhall fynd ſuche thynge therin as maye geue theym good occaſyon to put lyttell dowte but that yt ſhuld be of great and vndenyable authoryte. For they ſhall fynde there that the greate good and godly valyaunt capytayne of goddys people dyd inſtytute and ordayne the great feſte of the dedycacyon of the temple of Hieruſalē called feſtū encemorū of the annuall inſtytucyon / of whyche feſte we rede no where ellys but in y• boke of the Machabeys. And yet fynde we that feſte euer after contynued and had in honour vntyll cryſtꝭ awne dayes / and our ſauyour hym ſelfe went to the celebracyon of that ſame feſte / as appereth
 in the goſpell of ſaynt Ihān. So that yt may well appere that ye bokys of that noble hyſtory wherof remeaneth ſo noble a monument and remembraunce / contynually kepte and reſerued ſo longe after /  and honowred by cryſtes awne precyouſe ꝑſon and teſtyfyed by hys holy Euangelyſte in the boke of hys holy goſpell: can not be but vndowted trewth and of dyuyne authoryte.
            ¶And ſurely yf they deny ye boke of the Machabeys for holy ſcripture bycauſe the Iewys accompte yt not for ſuche: then ſhall they by the ſame reaſon refuſe the authoryte of the boke of Sapyence / and proue theym ſelfe inſypyentys. And lyke wyſe yf they take all ſcrypture byſyde the newe teſtament to be of none other force and authoryte then yt ys accomptyd in the rule and canon of the Iewes: then ſhall the hole pſalter of Dauyd the very ſomme of clere and lyghte ſome propheſyes / leeſe amonge theym greate parte of his authoryte /  ſyth yt ys not taken in lyke force and ſtrenght among the Iewes as yt ys in Cryſtys church.
            ¶Fynall for the boke of the Machabees / ſyth the church of Cryſte accounteth yt for holy ſcrypture: there can no man dout therof but he that wyll take awaye all credence and authoryte from the hole ſcrypture of god the very goſpellys and all. For yf theſe heretykys deny for holy ſcrypture eny boke that the chyrche of Cryſte accounteh for holy ſcrypture: then deny they one of the grettyſt foundacyons of all cryſtē fayth / and the thyng whych theyr maſter Marten Luther hym ſelf hath all redy confeſſed for trew. For he affyrmyth hym ſelfe that god hath gyuen vnto the church of Cryſte that gyfte / that the church cannot fayle ſurely and certeynly to diſcerne betwene the wordys of god and the wordys of men: & yt yt cannot be deſceyuyd in the choyſe of holy ſcrypture and reiectyng of the contrary: ſo farforth that he cō
               feſſyth as he nedys muſt of neceſſyte / that the noble doctour and gloryouſe cōfeſſour ſaynt Auſteyne ſayth very well / when he ſayd that he ſhuld not haue beleuyd the goſpell but for ye authorite of ye church. For he had not knowen whych had bene the very boke of the goſpels and whych not amōg ſo many as were wryten / but by the authoryte of the church / whom the ſpyryte of god aſſyſted as yt euer dothe and euer ſhall / in the choyſe and receyuyng of holy ſcripture and reieccyō of the coūterfete and falſe. Wherby yt apperyth clerely not onely by that holy doctour ſaynt Auſteyn / but alſo by the confeſſyon of ye arche heretyke Luther hym ſelfe / that the church cannot be dyſſeyuyd in the choyce of holy ſcrypture and reieccyon of the contrary: ſo farforthe yt yt neyther can receyue as holy ſcrypture eny booke that ys none / nor reiect for other then holy ſcrypture eny boke that is holy ſcrypture in dede. And ſurely yf the churche myghte ſo be deceyuyd in the choyſe of holy ſcripture / that they myghte take & approue for holy ſcrypture
 eny boke that were none: then ſtode all cryſtendome in dout and vnſurety /  whether ſaynt Ihāns goſpell were holy ſcripture or not / and ſo forth of all the new teſtament.
            ¶And therfore ſyth as we haue ſhewed you by the heretykes owne confeſſyons / the church of Cryſte cannot be deceyuyd in the choyſe & eleccyon of holye ſcrypture / by whyche theyre confeſſyon they muſte nedys abyde and not flyt therfro / as they dayly do chaūge and vary from theyr owne wordꝭ in many other thyngis / except that they wyll in the fallyng from that poynte refuſe the ſtrēghte and authoryte of the newe teſtament of cryſte: and ſyth as your ſelfe well perceyueth alſo the churche of cryſte receyueth and taketh and (as ye ſe by ſaynt Hyerome and other olde holy doctours thys thowſande yere) hath approued and fermely byleued the holy boke of the Machabeys to be one of the volumes of holy ſcrypture: and then in that boke ye ſe ſo manyfeſtely purgatory proued / that none heretyque as ſhameleſſe as they be can yet for ſhame ſay the cōtrary / but are by the playn and open wordys of that holy boke ſo dreuen vp to y• hard wall / that they can no ferther but are fayne to ſay that the boke ys no parte of ſcrypture /  whyche ſhyfte they muſt nedys forſake agayne or ellys reuoke theyre awne wordys and therwyth alſo thauthoryte of all cryſtꝭ goſpell: there ſhall yf eyther reaſon or ſhame can holde / neuer nede eny ferther thyng for the profe of purgatory to ſtoppe y• mowthys of all the heretyques that are or ſhalbe to the worldys ende.
            ¶But yet ſyth they be ſo hameleſſe and vnreſonable that the thyng whyche they can in no wyſe defende / they can not yet fynde in theyre prowde harte to gyue ouer / but when yt ys prouyd by dyuers playne textis of y• olde teſtament / then hauyng no probable reaſon for theyre parte they neuer the more gyue place to trewth / but ſtykke to theyre obſtynate nay: let vs ſe whyther our purpoſe be not preued by good and ſubſtancyall authoryte in the newe teſtament alſo.
            ¶And fyrſte let vs conſyder the wordys of the bleſſyd apoſtle and euāgelyſt ſaynt Ihān / where he ſayth: Eſt peccatū vſque ad mortē non dico vt pro to roget quis. There ys ſayth he ſome ſynne that ys vnto the deth / I bydde not that eny man ſhall praye for that. Thys ſynne as the interpreters agre / ys vnderſtanden of deſperacyon and impenytens: as though ſaynt Ihān wolde ſay / yt who ſo depart owt of thys world impenitēt or in diſpayre / eny prayour after made cā neuer ſtande hym in ſtede. Then appereth yt clerely that ſaynt Ihān meaneth that there be other whyche dye not in ſuch caſe for whom he wolde men ſhuld pray / bycauſe y• prayour to ſuche ſowlys may be ꝓfytable. But that profyte can no man take neyther beyng in heuen where yt nedeth not / nor beyng in hell where yt boteth not. Wherfore it appereth plaine yt ſuch prayour helpeth onely for purgatory: whych
 they muſte therfore nedys graunte / excepte they deny ſaynt Ihān.
            ¶What ſaye they to the wordys of ſaynte Ihān in the fyfte chapyter of the Apocalyps: I haue harde ſaythe he euery creature that ys in heuen and vppon the yerth and vnder the yerthe and that be in the ſee and all thyngys that be in them / all theſe haue I harde ſay: benedyccyon and honoure and glorye and power for euer / be to hym that ys ſyttyng in the trone / and vnto the lamb.
            ¶Now wotteth euery man well / that in hell among damnyd ſoulys ys there none that gyueth glory to Criſte for the redempcyon of mā. For they for anger that by theyr owne defaut they haue loſt theyr ꝑte therof / and cannot for prowd hart take theyr faut to them ſelf / fall to blaſphemy as the deuyll doth hym ſelf / and impute theyr ſynne to the faut of goodys grace / and theyr damnacyon to the blame of hys creacyō. So that the prayſe and glory that ys geuen by creatures in hell vnto the lamb for mannys redempcyon / ys onely by the ſowlys in purgatory / that be and ſhalbe partyners of that redempcyon: as the creaturys walkyng vppon yerth ſaylynge in the ſe / that gyue the honour to Cryſte for mannys redempcyon / be onely the cryſten people whyche loke and hope to be parteners therof / and not infydels that beleue yt not. But the bleſſyd creaturis in heuen geue honour to Criſte for mannys redempcyon / for that ioy and pleaſure that theyre charyte taketh in the ſocyete and felyſhyp of ſaued ſoules. And in thys place yt ys a worlde to ſe the foly of ſome heretykys / what euaſyon they ſeke to voyd from thys place of ſcrypture. They ſey that yt ys no more to be vnderſtanden by ſowlys here in purgatory nor cryſten men lyuyng vppon erth / then by fyſhes in the ſee and the dyuell and damnyd ſoulys in hell: becauſe the text ſayth that euery creature in theſe and in hell ſpake that laud and honour to the lamb. But by this wyſe way myght they preue / that when ye pray for all cryſten ſowlys /  ye mean to pray for our Ladyes ſouly and for Iudas too: and that our ſauyour when he ſent hys apoſtles and bad them preche his goſpell to euery creature / thay may bere you in hand that he bad thē preche to oxen and keene and theyre caluys to / becauſe all they be creaturis. But as they were ſente to none other creature / then ſuche as he mēt of thoughe he ſpake of all / nor ye meane to pray for no ſoulys but ſuch as haue nede and may haue help though ye ſpeke of all: ſo though ſaynt Ihān ſpake of euery creature in hell geuyng honour to Cryſte for mannys redempcyon / yet ment he but ſuch as be in the hell in whych they reioyce therin and ſhalbe parteners therof / whych be onely we in purgatorye / and not the dyuels and damnyd ſoulys yt blaſpheme hym though theyr iuſt poniſhmēte redownd agaynſt theyr wyll to the glory of goddys ryghtuouſnes.
            ¶If all thys wyll not ſatyſfye theym / wyll ye ſe yet a nother clere
 place and ſuche as none heretyque can auoyde? Doth not the bleſſyd apoſtle ſaynt Peter as appereth in y• ſecūd chapiter of y• apoſtles actꝭ /  ſay of our ſauyour cryſte in this wyſe: Quē deus ſuſcitauit ſolutis doloribus inferm: In theſe wordꝭ he ſheweth that paynys of hell were loſed. But theſe paynys were neyther paynys of that hell in whych the dāpned ſowlys be payned / whych nether were loſed then nor neuer be loſed / but be and ſhalbe as oure ſauyour ſayth hym ſelf euerlaſtyng: nor theſe paynys y• were than loſed were not y• paynys in limbo patrum / for there were none to be loſed / for the good ſoulys were there as our ſauyour ſheweth hym ſelfe in quiete cumforte and reſte. And ſo appereth yt euydētly / that the paynys of hell that were loſed / were onely the paynys of purgatory whych ys alſo called hell by occaſyon of the latyn word and the greke worde both. For in theſe tongys for as mych as byfore the reſurreccyon of our ſauyour cryſt there was neuer none y• aſcended vp in to heuen) there was no peple that ony otherwyſe ſpake of ſowlys / then that they were gone down byneth in to the lowe place. And therfore in the wordys of the comē crede ys yt ſayed of our ſauyour cryſte after hys paſſyon: deſcendit ad inferna: that ys to ſay he deſcended downe byneth in to the lowe placys. In ſtede of whyche low placys the englyſhe tonge hath euer vſed thys worde hell. And certayne ys yt and very ſure / that cryſte deſcended not in to all theſe low placys / nor in to euery place of hell /  but onely in to lymbus patrum and purgatory. Whych two placys becauſe they be partys of habytacyons of ſowlys byneth (all whych habytacyons byneth haue in englyſhe bene allway called hell) therfore are theſe two placys amonge other taken and comprehēded vnder y• name of hell. Whych word hell nothynge ellys ſygnyfyeth vnto vs in hys generall ſygnyfycacyon / but y• habytacyons of ſowlys byneth or vnder vs in y• low placys vnder y• groūd. Albe yt bycauſe limbus patrum and purgatory be called in englyſhe alſo by theyre ſpecyall namys beſyde: therfore ys moſte comenly thys word hell reſtayned to the ſpecyall ſygnyfycacyon of that low place byneth in whych the dāpned ſoulꝭ be punyſhed. Thys mych haue we ſhewed you of this word hell / bycauſe we wold not that the comen takyng therof myght bryng you in to eny errour. So that by thys place ye ſe preued by the playne wordys of ſaynt Peter / that cryſte at hys reſurreccyon dyd loſe and vnbynd paynys in hell / whych as we haue ſhewed you coud be no where there but in purgatory. For in the ſpeciall hell of damned ſowlys y• paynꝭ were not loſed. And in lymbus patrū was no paynꝭ to be loſyd. And therfore except they denye ſaynt Peter / they cannot deny purgatory.
            ¶And yet yf they deny ſaynt Peter: we ſhall then alledge thē ſaynt Poule / whom they be beſt content to here of / becauſe that of the dyffyculte

For none other place ys there then thys in the worlde to cum after mannys lyfe / in whych eyther ſynne or payne dew to eny ſynne ſhalbe remitted. For in to heuē ſhall neyther ſynne nor payn enter: and in hell ſhall neuer none be releaſyd. And therefore when Cryſte by ſhewynge that ſum kynde of ſynne ſhall not be remyttyd in the worlde to cum: doth geue men knowlege that on the tother ſyde ſum ſynnys ſhall in the worlde to come be remytted and forgeuen. And then ſyth no man douteth but that neyther in hell ſhall eny ſynnys by forgeuen nor in heuen: very reſon techyth that the place in whych ſome ſynnys ſhalbe forgeuen after thys lyfe / can be none other but purgatory.

            ¶For who ſo lyſteth to beleue that all to gether ys lyes that he hereth ſo mych people ſpeke of & ſeeth ſo many good men wryte of: for no cūtrey ys there in cryſtēdome in whych he ſhall not here credably reported of ſuch apparycyōs dyuers tymys there ſene & apperyng /

And then ſhall he ſend them where they ſhall ſent ſo ſurely / & to theyr payne ſe ſuch a gryſly ſyght as ſhall ſo greue theyr hartys to loke therō / that they ſhall ſay as Criſte ſayd to ſaynt Thomas of Inde: Beatiqui nō viderunt et crediderunt: Bleſſyd & happy be they that beleuyd thys gere and neuer ſaw yt. For ſurely in thys world y• goodnes of god ſo tēperyth ſuch apparycyōs / as hys hygh wyſedome ſeeth yt moſt ꝓfytable for help & reliefe of the dede and inſtruccyon and amendement of the quyk: kepynge ſuche apparycyōs of hys great marcy moſt comenly frō y• ſyght of ſuch as wold turne hys godnes in to theyre awne harme. And ſurely of hys tender fauoure toward you / doth hys great goodnes prouyde: that ſuch apparycyons /  reuelacyons / and myracles / ſhold not be to copyouſe and commune: wherby good men ſeyng the thynge at eye / ſhold leſe the great parte of that they now meryte by fayth: ayd euyll folke when they were onys famelyer wyth yt / wolde then as lytle regarde yt as they now lytle beleue yt.
            ¶Now it is a world to ſee wyth what folye they fortefy theyr falſe
 belyefe / and in to what fonde fanteſyes they fall / whyle they declyne from the trouth. For whyle they deny purgatory / they now afferm / & ſpecyally Luther hym ſelf) that ſoules vnto doomys day do nothyng els but ſlepe. Wo wold they be yf they fell in ſuch a ſlepe as many a ſoule ſlepeth here / & as Iudas hath all redy ſlept .xv. C. yere in hell.
            ¶Then ſay they that yf there were eny purgatory / oute of whych the pope myght delyuer eny ſoule by his pardō: thē were he very cruell in that he delyueryth theym not wythout mony: a alſo that he ryddyth them not henſe all to gether at onys. The furſt ys a great foly that ſyth our lord ſendyth them thyder for ſatyſfaccyon to be made in ſum maner for theyr ſynne: the pope ſhuld rather agaynſt goddys purpoſe delyuer them fre / then chaunge the maner of theyr ſatyſfaccyon from payne into prayour / almes dede / or other good workys to be done by theyr frend

                for them in ſome poynt ꝓfytable & neceſſary for the hole corps of cryſtendome or ſome good member of the ſame.
            ¶Now ys there in the ſeconde not onely mych more foly / but yt importeth alſo playn and opē blaſphemy. For preſuppoſed that the pope may delyuer all ſowlys out of purgatory: yet yf he were therfore cruell as oft as he leueth any there / th

               s vnreſonable reaſon layeth cruelte to y• blame of god / which may vndoutedly delyuer all ſowlys thys and yet he leueth thē there. Thys blaſphemy ſhuld alſo to wch hys hygh maieſte for kepyng any ſoule in hell / frō whens no mā douteth but that he myght yf he lyſt delyuer them all for euer. But as he wyll not delyuer eny thens: ſo wyll he not wythout good order delyuer eny ſoule hēce. For as of hys iuſtice they be worthy to ly there for euer: ſo be we worthy to lye here for the whyle / and in god no cruelte though he ſuffer hys mercy to be cōmunely ſuſpendyd and temperyd wyth the balaunce of hys iuſtyce. And though he take vs not hēce all at onys orderleſſe & at aduenture: hys hygh wyſdome ys prayſe worthy & not worthy blame. Our lord forbede y• euer we ſo ſhuld & ſuch ys hys grace y• we neuer ſhall for eny payne poſſible y• we can ſuffer here / hold our ſelf cōtēt to here ſuch folyſh wordes as ēply ſo playn blaſphemy agaynſt goddys hygh marcyfull maieſte. For ſurely theſe folk in puttyng forth of thys theyr vnwyſe argument / make a coūtetenaunce to throw yt agaynſt the pope / but in very dede they caſte ye at goddys hed.
            ¶For as for the pope who ſo conſyder yt well / goeth forther from the ſample of god that ys ſet for cryſtes vycar in hys church by geuyng ouer lyberall pardon: thā by beyng theryn to ſcarce & ſtrayght. For god remytteth not here at aduenture though he may do hys pleaſure /  but obſerueth ryght good and great reſpecte / as the prayours & interceſſyons made for vs or other ſatyſfaccyon done for vs by ſome other men. And thys order vſeth and of reaſon ought to vſe hys vycar
 alſo in the dyſpenſynge toward oure relyefe / the precyouſe treaſure of our comforte that cryſte hath put in his kepynge. For ellys yf other the pope or god ſhold alway forthwith delyuer euery mā here /  or rather kepe euery man henſe as theſe heretyques wold make men byleue that god doth in dede / and wolde that the world ſholde ſo take yt: thē ſhold god or the pope as we ſomewhat haue ſayd byfore / gyue a greate occaſyon to men bordely to fall in ſynne / and lytell to care or force how ſlowly they ryſe agayne. Whych thyng neyther were mete for the popys offyce / nor agreable to the great wyſedome of god / and myche leſſe mete for hys marcy. For by that meane ſhuld he gyue innumerable folke greate occaſyon of damnacyon / whyche preſumyng vppon ſuche eaſy ſhorte remiſſyon / wolde luſtely draw to lewdenes wyth lytell care of amendement.
            ¶And ſo appereth yt that the thynge whyche theſe wyſe men wolde haue ye take for cruell / ys of tre
                  •
               th moſte mercyfull: and the thynge whych they wold haue to ſeme very benygne and pytyouſe ys in very dede moſte rygorouſe and moſt cruell: lyke wyſe as a ſharpe mayſter that chaſtyſeth hys ſeruaunt / is in that poynt more fauorable thā ys an eaſy one that for lakke of punyſhement letteth theym runne on the brydle and gyueth theym occaſyon of hangynge / Whyche thynge hath place alſo bytwene the father and the child / And therfore in holy ſcrypture that father is not accompted for vnlouyng and cruell / that beteth hys chyld / but rather he that leueth yt vndone. For he that ſpareth the rodde ſayth holy wrytt hateth the chyld. / And god thefore that ys of all fathers the moſt tyder / louyng / and moſt benygne and mercyfull /  leueth no chyld of his vncorrected: but ſcourgeth euery chyld that he taketh to hym. And therfore neyther god remytteth at aduenture the paynys of purgatory: nor no more muſt the pope nether / but yf that he wyll whyle he laboureth to do good and be pytuouſe to vs that are dede / be cruell & do mych more harme to theym that be quyk: and whyle he wyll draw vs owte of purgatory / dryue many of them in to hell. Frome deſyre of which kynd of helpe / we ſo farre abhorre /  that we wold all rather choſe to dwell here long in moſt bytter payn /  than by ſuch way to gete henſe as myght gyue occaſyon of eny mānꝭ damnacyon.
            ¶Now where they lykewyſe obiecte in countenaunce agaynſte the clergy / but yet in very dede they ſtryke the ſtroke at vs whome they wolde byreue the ſuffragys of good people / obiectynge that no man may ſatyſfye for a nother / nor that the prayour nor almoyſe nor other good dede done by one man may ſtande a nother in ſtede / but y• euery man muſt nedys all thynge y• he wyll haue helpe of / do it euery whyt hym ſelfe / and ſo that no mānys good dede done amonge you for vs in relyefe of our payn could in eny maner ſerue vs: this oppinyon as
 yt ys toward vs very peſtylent and pernycyouſe / ſo ys yt of yt ſelfe very falſe and folyſſhe. For fyrſte yf all that euer muſte auayle eny man / muſte nedys be done by hym ſelfe / and no mannys meryte may be applyed to the helpe of a nother / then were wyped a way from all men all the merytys of cryſtys bytter paſſyon / in whych though yt be trew that god dyed on the croſſe bycauſe of the vnite of god and man in perſon / yet had hys tender manhed all the payne for vs / and hys impaſſyble godhed felte no payne at all / Wherof ſerueth alſo ye prayours  that euery man prayeth for other? Wherfore dyd ſaynt Powle pray for all other criſtē men / and deſyre them all to pray for hym alſo and eche of them for other / that they myght be ſaued?
            ¶And why ys there ſo ſpecyall a mencyon made in the actys of the apoſtles / that at the deliuery of ſaynt Peter owt of pryſon / ye church made contynuall prayour and interceſſyon for hym? but for to ſhewe that god the rather delyuered hym for other mēnys prayours. And thynke ye that yf god haue pyte vppon one man for an others ſake / & delyuereth hym at a nother mannys petycyon from a lyttell payne or pryſonement in the worlde there vppon erth: he hath not at other mē

            ¶Then fynd theſe folke a nother knotte hard as they thynke to vndo. For they ſay yt yf a nother mānys merytys may ſerue me / wherto ſhuld I nede to do eny good my ſelfe. Thys obieccyon ys mych lyke as yf they wold ſay yf other men may take me owt of ye fyre: wherto ſhulde I labour to ryſe my ſelfe. Very trewth yt ys that ſometyme the good wurkꝭ of one man wrought wyth good affeccyon / may purchaſe an other man grace for to mende and wurke for hym ſelf. But ſurely of comē courſe he that wyll not hym ſelfe wurk wyth theym /  geteth lyttell good of other mennys good dedys. For yf thy ſelfe do ſtyll drawe bakward whyle other good men wyth theyre prayour laboure to pull the forward: yt wyll be longe ere thou make eny good days iourney. And therfore ye holy doctour ſaynt Auſtayne / in ye bleſſyd boke that he made of the cure and care that men ſhuld haue of vs ſely parted ſowlys: towcheth quykly the very poynte that there can none take profyte of other mennys good dedys / but onely ſuch as haue deſerued by ſome good thynge in theyre awne dedys / that other mennys dedys ſhuld helpe them: and that hath euery men done at the leſte wyſe by hys fynall repentaunce and purpoſe of amendement /  that departeth the world in the ſtate of grace.
            ¶For he that ys owte of that ſtate / can not take the profyte of other mennys merytys done for hym. And therfore damned ſoulys can not by other mennys merytys be delyuered of damnacyon: nor in lykewyſe
 he that entendeth to perſeruer in ſynne and do no good for hym ſelfe. But ſyth that we be not in y• caſe / but haue with helpe of gedd
