            PROLOGVS.
            
               NOt out of Envy, for ther's no effect
               Where there's no cauſe; nor out of Imitation
               For we haue euermore bin Imitated;
               Nor out of our contention to doe better
               Then that which is oppoſde to ours in Title,
               For that was good; and better cannot be:
               And for the Title if it ſeeme affected
               We might as well haue calde it, God you good Even:
               Onely that Eaſt-ward; weſt-wards ſtill exceedes,
               Honour the Sunnes faire riſing, not his ſetting;
               Nor is our Title vtterly enſorſte,
               As by the points we touch at, you ſhall ſee;
               Beare with our willing paines, if dull or witty,
               We onely dedicate it to the Citty.

                     AND whether with you now? what looſe action are you bound for? come what comrades are you to meete withall? whers the ſupper? whers the ſupper? whers the randeuous?
               
               
                  Quick.
                  Indeed, and in very good ſober truth, Sir.
               
               
                  Touch.
                  Indeed, and in very good ſober truth Sir? Behinde my backe thou wilt ſweare faſter then a french foot boy, and talke more bawdily then a common midwife, and now indeede and in very good ſober truth Sir: but if a priuie ſearch ſhould be made, with what furniture are you riggd now? Sirrah I tell thee, I am thy maiſter William Tutchſtone Goldſmith: and thou my Prentiſe Francis Quick-ſiluer: and will ſee whether you are running. Worke vpon that now.
                  
               
               
                  Quick.
                  Why Sir I hope a man may vſe his recreation with his maiſters profit.
               
               
                  Touch.
                  Prentiſes recreations are ſeldome with their maiſters profit. Worke vpon that now. You ſhall giue vp your cloake tho you be no Alderman. Heyday, Ruffins hall. Sword, pumps, heers a Racket indeed. Touch. vncloakes Quick.
                  
               
               
                  Quick.
                  Worke vpon that now.

                  Quick.
                  Why zbloud ſir, my mother's a Gentlewoman: and my father a Iuſtice of Peace, and of Quorum, and tho I am a yonger brother and a prentiſe yet I hope I am my fathers ſonne: and by Gods lidde, tis for your worſhip and for your commoditie that I keepe companie. I am intertaind among gallants,

true: They call me coozen Franke, right; Ilend them monnies, good; they ſpend it, well. But when they are ſpent, muſt not they ſtriue to get more? muſt not their land flye? and to whom? ſhall not your worſhip ha, the refuſall? well, I am a good member of the Citty if I were well conſidered. How would Morchants thriue, if Gentlemen would not be vnthriftes? How could Gentlemen be vnthriſts if their humours were not fed? How ſhould their humours be fedde but by whit meate, and cunning ſecondings? well, the Cittie might conſider vs. I am going to an Ordinary now; the gallants fall to play, I carry light golde with me: the gallants call coozen Francke ſome golde for ſiluer, I change, gaine by it, the gallants looſe the gold; and then call coozen Francke lend me ſome ſiluer. Why—
               
               
                  Tou.
                  Why? I cannot tell, ſeuē ſcore pound art thou out in the caſh, but looke to it, I will not be gallanted out of my monies. And as for my riſing by other mens fall; God ſhield me. Did I gaine my wealth by Ordinaries? no: by exchanging of gold? no: by keeping of gallants company? no. I hired me a little ſhop, fought low, tooke ſmall gaine, kept no debt booke, garniſhed my ſhop for want of Plate, with good wholſome thriftie ſentences; As, Touchſtone, keepe thy ſhopp, and thy ſhoppe will keepe thee. Light gaines makes heauy purſes. Tis good to be merry and wiſe: And when I was wiu'd, hauing ſomething to ſtick too, I had the horne of Suretiſhip euer before my eyes: You all know the deuiſe of the Horne, where the young fellow ſlippes in at the Butte end, and comes ſqueſd out at the Buckall: and I grew vp, and I praiſe prouidence, I beare my browes now as high as the beſt of my neighbours: but thou-well looke to the accounts, your fathers bond lyes for you: ſeuen ſcore pound is yet in the reere.
               
               
                  Quick.
                  Why Slid ſir, I haue as good, as proper gallants wordes for it as any are in London, Gentlemen of good phraſe, perfect language, paſſingly behau'd, Gallants that weare ſocks and cleane linnen, and call me kinde coozen Francke, good coozen Francke, for they know my Father; and by god; lidde ſhall not I truſt hem? not truſt?

The one muſt bee Ladyfied forſooth: and be attir'd juſt to the Court-cut, and long tayle. So farre is ſhe ill naturde to the place and meanes of my preferment and fortune, that ſhee throwes all the contempt and diſpight, hatred it ſelfe can caſt vpon it. Well, a peece of Land ſhe has, t'was her Grandmothers gift: let her, and her Sir Petronel, flaſh out that. But as for my ſubſtance, ſhee that skornes mee, as I am a Citizen and Trades-man, ſhall neuer pamper her pride with my induſtrie: ſhall neuer vſe me as men doe Foxes; keepe themſelues warme in the skinne, and throwe the body that bare it to the dung-hill. I muſt goe intertaine this Sir Petronell.

                  For the paſſion of patience, looke if ſir Petronell approach; that ſweet, that fine, that delicate, that—for loues ſake tell me if he come. O ſiſter Mill, though my father be a low capt tradſman, yet I muſt be a Lady: and I praiſe God my mother muſt call me Medam, (does he come?) off with this gowne for ſhames ſakes, off with this gowne: let not my Knight take me in the Citty cut in any hand: tear't, pax ont (does he come) tear't of.

                  Lord ſiſter, with what an immodeſt impaciencie and diſgracefull ſcorne, doe you put off your Citty tier: I am ſorrie to thinke you imagin to right your ſelfe, in wronging that which hath made both you and vs.

                  I tell you I cannot indure it, I muſt be a Lady: do you weare your Quoiffe with a London licket; your Stammell petticoate with two guardes, the Buffin gowne with the Tuftaffitic cape, and the Veluet lace. I muſt be a Lady, and I will be a Lady. I like ſome humors of the Cittie Dames well, to eate Cherries onely at an Angell a pound, good; to dye rich Scarlet black, pretty: to line a Grogaram gowne cleane

thorough with veluet, tollerable; their pure linnen, their ſmocks of 3. li. a ſmock are to be borne withall. But your minſing niceryes, taffata pipkins, durance petticotes, & ſiluer bodkins:—Gods my life, as I ſhall be a Lady I cannot indure it. Is hee come yet? Lord what a long knight tis! And euer ſhee cride ſhoute home, and yet I knew one longer, and euer ſhe cryde ſhoute home, fa, la, ly, re, lo, la.

                  Where Titles preſume to thruſt before fit meanes to ſecond them, Wealth and reſpect often growe ſullen and will not follow. For ſure in this, I would for your ſake I ſpake not truth. Where ambition of place goes before fitneſſe of birth, contempt and diſgrace follow. I heard a Scholler once ſay, that 
                        Ʋliſſes when he counterfeited himſelfe madde, yoakt cattes, and foxes, and dogges togither to draw his plowe, whilſt he followed and ſowed ſalt: But ſure I judge them truely madde, that yoake citizens and courtiers, trades men and ſouldiers, a gold-ſmiths daughter and a knight: well ſiſter, pray God my father ſowe not ſalt too.

                  Alas, poore Mil. when I am a Lady, Ile pray for thee yet I faith: Nay, and Ile vouchſafe to call thee ſiſter Mil ſtill, for though thou art not like to be a Lady as I am, yet ſure thou art a creature of Gods making; and mayeſt paraduenture to bee ſau'd as ſoone as I, (dos he come?) And euer and anon ſhe doubled in her ſong.
                  
                  
                     Now (Ladyes my comfort)

                     Tailer, Poldavis, prethee fit it

                  Fine and ſtifly i faith, twill keepe your thighes ſo coole and make your waſte ſo ſmall: here was a fault in your bodie, but I haue ſupplyed the deſect, with the effect of my ſteele inſtrument

And I thought you would not ha beene Knighted, (as I am an honeſt woman) I would ha dub'd you my ſelf, I praiſe God I haue wherewithall. But as for you daughter.—

                  Come, come, the day growes low: tis ſupper time; vſe my houſe the wedding ſolemnitie is at my wifes coſt; thanke mee for nothing but my willing bleſſing: for (I cannot faine) my hopes are faint.

                  How now ſir? the druncken hyckop, ſo ſoone this morning?
               
               
                  Quick.
                  Tis but the coldneſſe of my ſtomack forſooth.
               
               
                  Touch.
                  What? haue you the cauſe naturall for it? y'are a very learned drunckerd: I beleeue I ſhall miſſe ſome of my ſiluer ſpoones with your learning. The nuptiall night will not moiſten your throate ſufficiently, but the morning likewiſe muſt raine her dews into your gluttonous weſand.

                  An't pleaſe you ſir, we did but drinke (vmp,) to the comming off, of the Knightly Bridegrome.

                  I forſooth: we druncke to his comming on (vmp,) when we went to bed; and now we are vp, we muſt drinke to his comming off: for thats the chiefe honour of a Souldier ſir, and therfore we muſt drinke ſo much the more to it, forſooth.

                  A very capitall reaſon. So that you goe to bed late, and riſe early to commit drunkenneſſe? you fullfill the Scripture very ſufficient wickedly forſooth.

                  So ſir, now I will go keepe my (vmp) credit with 'hem an't pleaſe you ſir.
               
               
                  Touch.
                  In any caſe Sir, lay one cup of Sack more alyour cold ſtomack, I beſeech you.

                  This is for my credit Seruants euer maintaine drunkenneſſe in their maiſters houſe, for their maiſters credit; a good idle Seruing-mans reaſon: I thanke Time, the night is paſt; I nere wakt to ſuch coſt; I thinke we haue ſtowd more ſorts of fleſh in our bellies, then euer Noahs Arke receiued: and for Wine, why my houſe turnes giddie with it, and more noiſe in it then at a Conduict; Aye me, euen beaſts condemne our gluttonie. Well, 'tis our Citties fault, which becauſe we commit ſeldome, we commit the more ſinfully, wee loſe no time in our ſenſualitie, but we make amends for it; O that we would do ſo in vertue, and religious negligences; But ſee here are all the ſober parcels my houſe can ſhowe, Ile caueſdrop, heare what thoughts they vtter this morning.
               
               Enter Goulding.
               
                  Goul.
                  But is it poſſible, that you ſeeing your ſiſter preferd to the bed of a Knight, ſhould containe your affections in the armes of a Prentice?
               
               
                  Myl.
                  I had rather make vp the garment of my affections in ſome of the ſame peece, then like a foole weare gownes of two coulours, or mix Sackcloth with Sattin.
               
               
                  Goul.
                  And doe the coſtly garments; the title and fame of a Lady the faſhion; obſeruation, and reuerence proper to ſuch preferment, no more enflame you, then ſuch conuenience as my poore meanes and induſtrie can offer to your vertues?
               
               
                  Mil.
                  I haue obſeru'd that the bridle giuen to thoſe violent flatteries of fortune, is ſeldome recouer'd; they beare one headlong in deſire from one noueltie to another: and where thoſe ranging appetites raigne, there is euer more paſſion then reaſons no ſtaye, and ſo no happineſſe. Theſe haſtie aduancements are not naturall; Nature hath giuen vs legges, to goe to our obiects; not wings to flie to them.
               
               
                  
                  Goul.
                  How deare an obiect you are to my deſires I cannot expreſſe, whoſe fruition would my maiſters abſolute conſent and yours vouchſafe me, I ſhould be abſolutely happy. And though it were a grace ſo farre beyond my merit, that I ſhould bluſh with vnworthineſſe to receiue it, yet thus farre both my loue & my meanes ſhall aſſure your requitall; you ſhall want nothing fit for your birth and education; what encreaſe of wealth and aduancement the honeſt and orderly induſtrie & skill of our trade will affoorde in any, I doubt not will be aſpirde by me; I will euer make your contenment the end of my endeuours; I will loue you aboue all; and onely your griefe ſhall be my miſerie; and your delight, my felicitie.
               
               
                  Touch.

                  Let me beſeech you, no Sir, the ſuperfluitie and colde meate left at their Nuptialls, will with bountie furniſh ours. The groſſeſt prodigallitie is ſuperfluous coſt of the Bellye: nor would I wiſh any invitement of States or friendes, onely your reuerent preſence and witneſſe ſhall ſufficiently grace and confirme vs.
               
               
                  Touch.
                  Sonne to mine owne boſome, take her and my bleſſing: The nice fondling, my Lady ſir-reuerence, that I muſt not nowe preſume to call daughter, is ſo rauiſh't with deſire to hanſell her new Coche, and ſee her knights Eaſtward Castle, that the next morning will ſweate with her buſie ſetting foorth, awaye will ſhe and her mother, and while their preparation is making, our ſelues with ſome two or three other friends will conſumate the humble matche, we haue in Gods name concluded.

                  My priuie Gueſt, luſtie Quickeſiluer, has drunke too deepe of the Bride-boule, but with a little ſleepe he is much recouered; And I thinke is making himſelfe readie, to bee drunke in a gallanter likenes: My houſe is as t'were the Caue, where the yong Out-lawe hoords the ſtolne vayles of his occupation; And here when he will reuell it in his prodigall ſimilitude, he retires to his Trunks, and (I may ſay ſoftly) his Punks: he dares truſt me with the keeping of both: for I am Securitie it ſelfe, my name is Securitie, the famous Vſurer.
               
               Enter Quickeſiluer in his Prentiſes Cote and Cap his gallant Breeches and Stockings, gartering himſelfe. Securitie following.

                  Why man, tis the London high-way to thriſt, if vertue bee vſde; tis but as a ſcrappe to the nette of villanie. They that vſe it ſimplie, thriue ſimplie I warrant: Waight and faſhion makes Goldſmiths Cockolds.

                     I now am free; and now will iuſtifie

                  What did he eate him?
               
               
                  Secu.
                  No, but he eate his breakefaſt for dreſſing him: and ſo dreſt him for breakfaſt.

                        Quickſiluer. O wittie Age, where age is young in witte,
                        And al youths words haue gray beards full of it!

                  But ah-las Francke, how will all this bee maintain'd now?
               
               
                  〈1 page missing〉
               
               
                  
Your place maintain'd it before.
               
                  Quickeſiluer.
                  Why and I maintainde my place. Ile to the Court, another manner of place for maintenance I hope then the ſilly Cittie. I heard my father ſay, I heard my mother ſing a nolde Song and a true: Tou art a ſhee foole, and know'ſt not what belongs to our male wiſedome. I ſhallbee a Marchaunt for-ſooth: truſt my eſtate in a wooden Troughe as hee does? What are theſe Shippes, but Tennis Balles for the windes to play withall? Toſt from one waue to another; Nowe vnder-line; Nowe ouer the houſe; Sometimes Bricke-wal'd againſt a Rocke, ſo that the guttes flye out againe: ſometimes ſtrooke vnder the wide Hazzard, and farewell Maſt. Marchant.
               
               
                  Synnedefie.
                  Well Francke, well; the Seas you ſay are vncertaine: But hee that ſayles in your Court Seas, ſhall finde 'hem tenne times fuller of hazzard; wherein to ſee what is to bee ſeene, is torment more then a free Spirite can indure; But when you come to ſuffer, howe many Iniuries ſwallowe you? What care and deuotion muſt you vſe, to humour an imperious Lord? proportion your lookes to his lookes? ſmiles to his ſmiles? fit your ſayles to the winde of his breath?
               
               
                  Quick.
                  Tuſh hee's no Iourney-man in his craft, that can not doe that.
               
               
                  Sinnedefie.
                  But hee's worſe then a Prentiſe that does it, not onely humouring the Lorde, but euery Trencherbearer, euery Groome that by indulgence and intelligence crept into his fauour, and by Pandatiſme into his Chamber; He rules the roſte: And when my honourable Lorde ſayes it ſhall bee thus, my worſhipfull Raſcall (the Groome of his cloſe ſtoole) ſayes it ſhall not bee thus, claps the doore after him, and who dares enter? A Prentiſe, quoth you? tis but to learne to liue, and does that diſgrace a man? hee that riſes hardly, ſtands firmely: but hee that riſes with eaſe, Alas, falles as eaſily.
               
               
                  Quickeſiluer.
                  A pox on you, who taught you this mor rallitie?
               
               
                  
                  Securitie.
                  Tis long of this wittie Age, Maiſter Francis. But indeede, Miſtris Synnedefie, all Trades complaine of inconuenience, and therefore tis beſt to haue none. The Marchaunt hee complaines, and ſayes, Trafficke is ſubiect to much vncertaintie and loſſe: let 'hem keepe their goods on dry land with a vengeaunce, and not expoſe other mens ſubſtances to the mercie of the windes, vnder protection of a woodden wall (as Maiſter Francis ſayes) and all for greedie deſire, to enrich themſelues with vnconſcionable gaine, two for one, or ſo: where I, and ſuch other honeſt men as liue by lending money, are content with moderate profite; Thirtie, or Fortie i'th'hundred: ſo wee may haue it with quietneſſe, and out of perill of winde and weather, rather then runne thoſe daungerous courſes of trading, as they doe.
               
               
                  Quick.
                  I Dad thou mayſt well bee called Securitie, for thou takeſt the ſafeſt courſe.
               
               
                  Securitie.
                  Faith the quieter, and the more contented; and, out of doubt, the more godly. For Marchants in their courſes are neuer pleaſ'd, but euer repining againſt Heauen: One prayes for a Weſterly winde to carry his ſhippe foorth; another for an Eaſterly to bring his ſhippe home; and at euery ſhaking of a leaſe, hee falles into an agonie, to thinke what daunger his Shippe is in on ſuch a Coaſt, and ſo foorth. The Farmer hee is euer at oddes with the Weather, ſometimes the clowdes haue beene too barren; Sometimes the Heauens forgette themſelues, their Harueſts anſwere not their hopes; Sometimes the Seaſon falles out too fruitefull, Corne will beare no price, and ſo foorth. Th'Artificer, hee's all for a ſtirring worlde, if his Trade bee too full and fall ſhort of his expectation, then falles he out of ioynt. Where we that trade nothing but money, are free from all this, wee are pleaſ'd with all weathers: let it raine or hold vp, bee calme or windy, let the ſeaſon be whatſoeuer, let Trade goe how it will, wee take all in good part;

een what pleaſe the heauens to ſend vs; ſo the Sunne ſtand not ſtill; and the Moone keepe her vſuall returnes; and make vp dayes, moneths, and yeares.
               
               
                  Quick.
                  And you haue good ſecuritie?
               
               
                  Secu.
                  I mary Francke, that's the ſpeciall point.
               
               
                  Quick.
                  And yet forſooth wee muſt haue Trades to liue withall; For wee cannot ſtand without legges, nor flye without wings; and a number of ſuch skurvie phraſes. No, I ſay ſtill; hee that has wit, let him liue by his wit: hee that has none, let him be a Tradeſ-man.
               
               
                  Secu.
                  Witty Maiſter Francis!
                  
                  Tis pittie any Trade ſhould dull that quicke braine of yours. Doe but bring Knight Petronell into my Parchment Toyles once, and you ſhall neuer neede to toyle in any trade, a my credit! You know his wiues Land?
               
               
                  Quickeſiluer.
                  Euen to a foote Sir, I haue beene often there: a pretie fine Seate, good Land, all intire within it ſelfe.
               
               
                  Secu.
                  Well wooded?
               
               
                  Quick.
                  Two hundered pounds woorth of wood readye to fell. And a fine ſweete houſe that ſtands iuſt in the midſt an't, like a Pricke in the midſt of a Circle; would I were your Farmer, for a hundred pound a yeere.
               
               
                  Secu.
                  Excellent M. Francis; how I do long to doe thee good: How I doe hunger, and thirſt to haue the honour to inrich thee? I, euen to die, that thou mighteſt inherite my liuing: euen hunger and thirſt, for a my Religion, M. Francis. And ſo tell Knight Petrouell I doe it to doe him a pleaſure.
               
               
                  Quickeſiluer.
                  Marry Dad, his horſes are now comming vp, to beare downe his Ladie, wilt thou lend him thy ſtable to ſet 'hem in?
               
               
                  Secur.
                  Faith M. Francis, I would be lothe to lend my Stable out of dores, in a greater matter I will pleaſure him, but not in this.
               
               
                  Quick.
                  
                     A pox of your hunger and thirſt. Well Dad, let him haue money: All he could any way get, is beſtowed on a Ship, now bound for 
                        Ʋirginia: the frame of which voiage is ſo cloſely conuaide, that his new Ladie nor any of her friendes know it. Notwithſtanding, as ſoone as his Ladyes hand is gotten to the

ſale of her inheritance, and you haue furniſht him with money, he will inſtantly hoyſt Saile, and away.
               
               
                  Secur.
                  Now a Franck gale of winde goe with him, Maiſter Franke, we haue too few ſuch knight aduenturers: who would not ſell away competent certainties, to purchaſe (with any danger) excellent vncertainties? your true knight venturer euer does it. Let his wife ſeale to day, he ſhall haue his money to day.

                  To morrow ſhe ſhall, Dad, before ſhe goes into the coū

                  Secur.
                  True good Maiſter Fraunces.
                  
               
               Enter Sindefie.
               
                  Quic.

                  A'my religion, a moſt faſhionable proiect; as good ſhe ſpoile the Lady, as the Lady ſpoile her; for tis three to one of one ſide: ſweete miſtreſſe Sinne, how are you bound to maiſter Frances! I doe not doubt to ſee you ſhortly wedde one of the head men of our cittie.

                  But ſweete Franke, when ſhall my father Securitie preſent me?
               
               
                  Quic.
                  With all feſtination; I haue broken the Ice to it already; and will preſently to the Knights houſe, whether, my good old Dad, let me pray thee with all formallitie to man her.
               
               
                  Secur.
                  Commaund me Maiſter Frances; I doe hunger and thirſt to doe thee ſeruice. Come ſweete Miſtreſſe Sinne, take leaue of my Wynnifride, and we will inſtantly meete francke Maiſter Frances at your Ladies.
               
               Enter Winnifride aboue.
               
                  Win.
                  Where is my Cu there? Cu?

                  I Winnie.

                  Wilt thou come in, ſweete Cu?

                  I Wynney, preſently. Exeunt.
                  
               
               
                  Quic.
                  I Wynney, quod he? thats all he can doe poore man; he may well cut off her name at Wynney. O tis an egregious Pandare! what will not an vſurous knaue be, ſo he may bee riche? O 'tis a notable lewes trump! I hope to liue to ſee dogs meate made of the old Vſurers fleſh; Dice of his bones; and Indentures of his skinne: and yet his skinne is too thicke to make Parchment, 'twould make good Bootes for a Peeter man to catch Salmon in. Your onely ſmooth skinne to make fine Vellam is your Puritanes skinne; they be the ſmootheſt and ſlickeſt knaues in a countrie.
               
               Enter Sir Tetronell in Bootes with a riding wan.
               
                  Petr.
                  Ile out of this wicked towne as faſt as my horſe can trot: Here's now no good action for a man to ſpend his time in. Tauerns growe dead; Ordinaries are blowne vp; Playes are at a ſtand; Howſes of Hoſpitallitie at a fall; not a Feather wauing, nor a Spurre gingling any where: Ile away inſtantlie.
               
               
                  Qui.
                  Y'ad beſt take ſome crownes in your purſe Knight, or elſe your Eaſtward Caſtle will ſmoake but miſerably.
               
               
                  Petr.
                  O Francke! my caſtle? Alas all the Caſtles I haue, are built with ayre, thou know'ſt.
               
               
                  Quic.
                  I know it Knight, and therefore wonder whether your Lady is going.
               
               
                  Pet.
                  Faith to ſeeke her Fortune I thinke. I ſaid I had a caſtle and land Eaſtward, and Eaſtward ſhe will without contradiction; her coach, and the coach of the Sunne muſt meete full butt: And the Sunne being out ſhined with her Lady-ſhips glorie, ſhe feares hee goes Weſtward to hange himſelfe.
               
               
                  Quic.
                  And I feare, when her enchanted Caſtle becomes inuiſible, her Ladyſhip will returne and follow his example.
               
               
                  Petr.
                  O that ſhe would haue the grace, for I ſhall neuer be able to pacific her, when ſhe ſees her ſelfe deceiued ſo.
               
               
                  Quic.
                  As eaſely as can be. Tell her ſhe miſtooke your directions, and that ſhortly, your ſelfe will downe with her to approoue it; and then, cloath but her croupper in a new

Gowne, and you may driue her any way you liſt: for theſe womē Sir, are like Eſſex Calues, you muſt wriggle 'hem on by the tayle ſtill, or they will neuer driue orderly.
               
               
                  Petr.
                  But alas ſweet Francke, thou know'ſt my habilitie will not furniſh her bloud with thoſe coſtly humors.
               
               
                  Quic.
                  Caſt that coſt on me Sir, I haue ſpoken to my olde Pandare Securitie, for money or commoditie; and commoditie (if you will) I know he will procure you.
               
               
                  Petr.
                  Commoditie! Alas what commoditie?
               
               
                  Qui.
                  Why Sir? what ſay you to Figges, and Rayſons?
               
               
                  Petr.
                  A plague of Figges and Rayſons, and all ſuch fraile commodities, we ſhall make nothing of 'hem.
               
               
                  Quic.
                  Why then Sir, what ſay you to Fortie pound in roſted Beefe?
               
               
                  Petr.
                  Out vpon't, I haue leſſe ſtomacke to that, then to the Figges and Rayſons: Ile out of Towne, though I ſoiourne with a friend of mine, for ſtaye here I muſt not; my creditors haue laide to arreſt me, and I haue no friend vnder heauen but my Sword to baile me.
               
               
                  Qui.
                  Gods me Knight, put 'hem in ſufficient ſureties, rather then let your Sworde bayle you; Let 'hem take their choice, eyther the Kings Benche, or the Fleete, or which of the two Counters they like beſt, for by the Lord I like none of 'hem.
               
               
                  Petr.
                  Well Francke there is no ieſting with my earneſt neceſſitie; thou know'ſt if I make not preſent money to further my voyage begun all's loſt, and all I haue laid out about it.
               
               
                  Qui.
                  Why then Sir in earneſt, if you can get your wiſe Lady to ſether hand to the ſale of her Inheritance, the bloud hound Securitie will ſmell out ready money for you inſtantly.
               
               
                  Petro.
                  There ſpake an Angell. To bring her to which conformitie, I muſt faine my ſelfe extreamly amorous; and alledging vrgent excuſes for my ſtay, behinde, part with her as paſſionately, as ſhe would from her foyſting hound.
               
               
                  Qui.
                  You haue the Sowe by the right eare Sir: I warrant there was neuer Childe longd more to ride a Cock horſe, or weare his new coate, thē ſhe longs to ride in hexr new Coache:

She would long for euery thing when ſhe was a maide; and now ſhe will runne mad for 'hem: I laye my life ſhe will haue euery yeare foure children; and what charge and change of humour you muſt endure while ſhe is with childe; and how ſhe will tie you to your tackling till ſhe be with child, a Dog would not endure: Nay, there is no Turne-ſpit Dog bound to his wheele more ſeruily, then you ſhall be to her wheele; For as that Dogge can neuer climbe the top of his wheele, but when the toppe comes vnder him: ſo ſhall you neuer clime the top of her contentment, but when ſhe is vnder you.
               
               
                  Petr.
                  Slight how thou terrifieſt me?
               
               
                  Quic.
                  Nay harke you ſir; what Nurſes, what Midwiues, what Fooles, what Phiſitions, what cunning women muſt be ſought for (fearing ſometimes ſhe is bewitcht, ſome times in a conſumption) to tell her tales, to talke bawdy to her, to make her laughe, to giue her gliſters, to let her bloud vnder the tongue, and betwixt the toes; how ſhe will reuile and kiſſe you; ſpit in your face, and lick it off againe; how ſhe will vaunt you are her Creature; ſhee made you of nothing; how ſhee could haue had thouſand marke ioyntures; ſhe could haue bin made a Lady by a Scotche Knight; & neuer ha' married him: Shee could haue had Poynados in her bed euery morning; how ſhe ſet you vp, and how ſhe will pull you downe: youle neuer be able to ſtand of your legges to endure it.
               
               
                  Petr.
                  Out of my fortune, what a death is my life bound face to face too? The beſt is, a large Time-fitted conſcience is bound to nothing: Marriage is but a forme in the Schoole of Policie, to which Schollers ſit faſtned onely with painted chaines, old Securities young wife is nere the further of with me.
               
               
                  Quic.
                  Thereby lyes a tale ſir. The old vſurer will be here inſtantly, with my Puncke Syndefie, whome you know your Lady has promiſt mee to entertaine for her Gentlewoman: and he (with a purpoſe to feede on you) inuites you moſt ſolemnly by me to ſupper.
               
               
                  Petr.
                  It falls out excellently fitly: I ſee deſire of gaine makes Iealouſie venturous: Enter Gyrt:
                  
                  See Francke here comes my Lady; Lord how ſhe viewes thee, ſhe knowes thee not I thinke in this brauerie.

                  Y'are very welcome! you muſt not put on your Hat yet.

                  No Madam; till I know your Ladiſhips further pleaſure, I will not preſume.

                  She is Madam; & one that her Father hath a ſpeciall care to beſtowe in ſome honourable Ladies ſeruice, to put her out of her honeſt humours forſooth, for ſhe had a great deſne to be a Nun, an't pleaſe you.

                  Secur.
                  A Nun Subſtantiue Madam I hope, if a Nun be a Noune. But I meane, Lady, a vowd maide of that order.

                     I pray thee ſweete Knight let me; I do ſo long to dreſſe vp thy caſtle afore thou com'ſt: But I marle how emy modeſt Siſter occupies her ſelfe this morning, that ſhee can not waite on me to my Coach, as well as her mother!

                     Touch.
                     An't pleaſe your worſhip, this is not your Siſter: This is my daughter, and ſhe call me Father, and ſo does not your Ladiſhip an't pleaſe your worſhip Madam.

                     No nor ſhe muſt not call thee Father by Heraldrie, becauſe thou mak'ſt thy Prentiſe thy Sonne as well as ſhe; Ah thou miſproude Prentiſe, dar'ſt thou preſume to marry a Ladies Siſter?

                     If your worſhip will haue it ſo? I ſaye there are two ſorts of Gentlemen. There is a Gentleman Artificiall, and a gentleman Naturall; Now, though your worſhip be a Gentleman Naturall: Worke vpon that now.
                     
                  
                  
                     Quick.
                     Well ſaid olde Touchstone, I am proude to heare thee enter a ſet ſpeech yfaith, forth I beſeech thee.
                  
                  
                     Touch.
                     Cry you mercie Sir, your worſhip's a Gentleman, I doe not know? if you bee one of my acquaintance y'are very much diſguiſde Sir.
                  
                  
                     Quick.
                     Go too old Quipper: forth with thy ſpeech I ſay.
                  
                  
                     Touch.
                     What Sir, my ſpeeches were euer in vaine to your gratious worſhip: And therefore till I ſpeake to you gallantry in deed, I will ſaue my breath for my broth anon. Come my poore ſonne and daughter; Let vs hide our ſelues in our poore humilitie and liue ſafe: Ambition conſumes it ſelfe, with the very ſhow. Worke vpon that now.

                     Let him goe, let him goe for Gods ſake: let him make his Prentiſe, his ſonne for Gods ſake: giue away his daughter for Gods ſake: and when they come a begging to vs for Gods ſake, let's laugh at their good husbandry for Gods ſake. Fare-well ſweet Knight, pray thee make haſte after.

                     What ſhall I ſay? I would not haue thee goe,

                     If it doe, canſt thou tell me how I may cure it?
                  
                  
                     Quick.
                     Excellent eaſily; diuide your ſelfe in two halfes, iuſt by the girdleſtead; ſend one halfe with your Lady, and keepe the cother your ſelfe: or elſe doe as all true Louers doe, part with your heart and leaue your bodie behinde: I haue ſeen't done a hundred times: Tis as eaſie a matter for a Louer to part without a heart from his ſweete heart, and he nere the worſe: as for a Mouſe to get from a Trappe and leaue her taile behinde him. See here comes the Writings.

                     Quick.
                     Thinke what they liſt; They long'd for a vagarie into the Countrie, and now they are fitted: So a woman marry to ride in a Coach, ſhe cares not if ſhe ride to her Ruine; Tis the great ende of many of their mariages: This is not firſt time a

Lady has ridde a falſe iournie in her Coach I hope.
                  
                  
                     Pet.
                     Nay, tis no Matter, I care little what they thinke; hee that wayes mens thoughts, has his handes full of nothing: A man in the courſe of this worlde ſhould bee like a Surgeons inſtrument, worke in the woundes of others, and feele nothing himſelfe. The ſharper, and ſubtler, the better.

                     To make you Partner, in my actions gaine
                     As deepely, as if you had ventur'd with me

                     Nor liue the leſt part of the time it asketh,

                     Bring out this Euen, in honeſt Neighbour-hood
                     To take his leaue with you, of me your Goſſip.
                     
                     I, in the meane time, will ſend this my friende
                     Home to his houſe, to bring his wife diſguiſ'd
                     Before his face, into our companie:
                     For Loue hath made her looke for ſuch a wile,
                     To free her from his tyranous Ieloſie.
                     And I would take this courſe before another:
                     In ſtealing her away to make vs ſport,
                     And gull his circumſpection the more groſely.
                     And I am ſure that no man like your ſelfe,
                     Hath credite with him to entice his Ieloſie,
                     To ſo long ſtaye abrode, as may giue time
                     To her enlardgment, in ſuch ſafe diſguiſe.
                  
                  
                     Secu.
                     A pretie, pithie, and moſt pleaſant proiect!
                     Who would not ſtraine a point of Neigh-bourhood,
                     For ſuch a point, de-vice? that as the ſhippe
                     Of famous Draco, went about the world,
                     Will wind about the Lawyer, compaſſing,
                     The world him ſelfe, he hath it in his armes:
                     And that's enough, for him, without his wife.
                     A Lawyer is Ambitious, and his head,
                     Can not bee praiſ'de, nor raiſ'de too high,
                     With any Forcke, of higheſt knauerye.

And gird me ſo perhaps with his law wit,
                     The other (which is pollicie indeede)
                     Is, that my wife may now be tyed at home,
                     Hauing no more but her old gowne abroade,
                     And not ſhowe me a quirck, while I fyrke others.

Ahlas, Ahlas, the offence is too common to be reſpected; So great a grace, hath ſeldome chanc'd to ſo vnthankfull a woman; to be rid of an old ielous Dotard; to enioy the armes, of a louing young Knight; that when your prick-leſſe Bramble is withered with griefe of your loſſe, will make you flooriſh a freſh in the Bed of a Ladie.

                  All haile, faire Hauen of married men onely, for there are none but married men Cuckolds. For my part, I preſume not to arriue here, but in my Maiſters behalfe, (a poore Butcher of Eaſt-cheape) who ſends me to ſet vp (in honour of Saint Luke) theſe neceſſarie Enſignes of his homage: And vp I got this morning, thus early, to get vp to the toppe of this famous Tree, that is all fruite and no leaues, to aduance this Creſt of my Maiſters occupation. Vp then, Heauen and Saint Luke bleſſe me, that I be not blowne into the Thames as I clime, with this furious Tempeſt; Slight, I thinke the Deuill be abroade, in likeneſſe of a ſtorme, to rob me of my Hornes: Harke how he roares. Lord! what a coyle the Thames keepes! ſhe beares ſome vniuſt burthen I beleeue, that ſhe kicks and curuets thus to caſt it: Heauen bleſſe all honeſt paſſengers, that are vpon her back now, for the Bitte is out of her mouth I ſee, and ſhee will runne away with 'hem. So, ſo, I thinke I haue made it looke the right way, it runnes againſt London-Bridge (as it were) euen full butt. And now, let mee diſcouer from this loftie proſpect, what pranckes the rude Thames playes in her deſperate lunacie. O me, here's a Boate has beene caſt away hard by. Alas, alas, See one of her paſſengers, labouring for his life, to land at this Hauen here; pray heauen he may recouer it: His next land is euē iuſt vnder me; hold out yet a little: whatſoeuer thou art, pray, and take a good heart to thee. Tis a man, take a mans heart to thee; yet a little further, get vp a thy legges man: now, tis

ſnallowe enough. So, ſo, ſo! Alas, hee's downe againe; hold thy winde Father: tis a man in a Night-cappe. So! now hee's got vp againe: now hee's paſt the worſt: yet thankes be to heauen; he comes toward me pretie and ſtrongly.

                  Landed at Cuckolds hauen? if it had not bin to die twentie times a liue, I ſhould neuer haue ſcapt death: I will neuer ariſe more: I will grouell here, and eate durt till I be choak't: I will make the gentle earth doe that, which the cruell water ha's denied me.

Ay me, ſee a nother remnant of this vnfortunate ſhip-wrack! or ſome other. A woman! yfaith, a woman, though it be almoſt at S. Kath'rins, I diſcerne it to be a woman for al her bodie is aboue the water, & her clothes ſwim about her moſt handſomely. O they beare her vp moſt brauely! has not a woman reaſon to loue the taking vp of her cloathes the better while ſhe liues, for this? Alas, how buſie the rude Thames is about her? A pox a'that waue. It wil drowne her, yfaith, twill drowne her. Crye God mercie, ſhee has ſcapt it! I thanke heauen ſhe has ſcapt it. O, how ſhe ſwimmes like a

Mermaide! ſome vigilant body looke out, and ſaue her. That's well ſaid, iuſt where the Prieſt fell in, there's one ſets downe a Ladder, and goes to take her vp: Gods bleſſing a thy heart boy, now take her vp in thy armes and to bedde with her. Shee's vp, ſhee's vp! Shee's a beautifull woman I warrant her, the Billowes durſt not deuoure her.

The Gowne with all things bounde with it are myne; which if you pleaſe to fetch as you haue promiſt, I will bouldly receiue the kinde fauour you haue offered, till your returne: intreating you, by all the good you haue done in preſeruing me hitherto, to let none take knowledge of what fauour you doe me, or where ſuch a one as I am beſtowed, leſt you incurre mee much more damage in my fame, then you haue done me pleaſure in preſeruing my life.

O me! a fine yong Gentleman! What? and taken vp at the Gallowes? Heauen graunt he be not one day taken downe there: A, my life it is ominous. Well, hee is deliuered for the time, I ſee the people haue all left him; yet will I keepe my proſpect a while, to ſee if any more haue bin ſhipwrackt.

                  Tuſh Knight, the tearmes of this Arte, euery ignorant Quack-ſaluer is perfect in: but Ile tell you how your ſelfe ſhal blanche Copper thus cunningly. Take Arſnicke, otherwiſe called Realga, (which indeede is plaine Ratsbane) Sublime 'hem three or foure times, then take the Sublimate of this Realga, and put'hem into a Glaſſe, into Chymia, & let'hem haue a conuenient decoction Naturall, foure and twentie houres, & he will become perfectly fixt: Then take this fixed powder, & proiect him vpon wel-purgd Copper, et habebis Magiſtriū.

                  Nay this I will do beſides; Ile take you off twelue pence from euery Angell, with a kind of Aquafortis, and neuer deface any part of the Image.

                  You ſhall reſtore that thus: Take your ſal Achyme prepar'd, and your diſtild Vrine; and let your Angels lie in it but foure and twenty howres, and they ſhall haue their perfect weight againe: come on now I hope this is enough to put ſome ſpirit into the liuers of you, Ile infuſe more an other time. We haue ſaluted the proud Ayre long enough with our bare skonces, now will I haue you to a wenches houſe of mine at London, there make ſhift to ſhift vs, and after ſuch fortunes as the ſtars ſhal aſſigne vs.

                  I wil once more to this vnhappy Tauerne before I ſhift one ragge of me more, that I may there know what is left behind, and what newes of their paſſengers.

                  Yes Sir, the harmeleſſe ſleepe you broke, and my anſwer to you would haue witneſt it, if you had had the patience

to haue ſtaid and anſwered me; but your ſo ſodaine retreate, made me imagine you were gone to Maiſter Brambles, and ſo reſted patient, and hopefull of your comming againe, till this your unbeleeued abſence brought me abroade with no leſſe then wonder, to ſeeke you, where the falſe Knight had carried you.

                  Talke not of it I beſeech thee, I am aſhamed to imagine it; I will home, I will home, and euery morning on my knees aske thee hartely forgiuenes. Exeunt.
Nowe will I deſcend my honourable Proſpect; the farthieſt ſeeing Sea marke of the World: Noe maruaile then if I could ſee two miles about me. I hope the redde Tempeſts anger be nowe ouer blowne, which ſure I thinke Heauen ſent as a puniſhment, for prophaning holy Saint Lukes memorie, with ſo ridiculous a cuſtome. Thou diſhoneſt Satyre, farewel to honeſt married Men; Farewel, to all ſorts, and degrees of thee. Farewel thou horne of hūger that calſt th'Inns a court to their Manger; Farewel thou horne of aboundāce, that adorneſt the headſmen of the Common-wealth; Farewell thou home of Direction, that is the Cittie Lanthorne; Farewell thou Horne of Pleaſure, the Enſigne of the huntſman; Farewell thou Horne of Deſtinie, thenſigne of the married man; Farewell thou Horne Tree that beareſt nothing but Stone fruite Exit.

                  Ha Sirah! Thinkes my Knight Aduenturer we can no point of our compaſſe? Doe wee not knowe North-north-eaſt? North-eaſt and by East? East and by North! nor plaine Eastward? Ha? haue we neuer heard of 
                        Ʋirginia? nor the Cauallaria? not the Colonoria? Can we diſcouer no diſcoueries? well, mine errant Sir Flaſh, and my runnagate Quickſiluer, you may drinke dronke, crack cannes, hurle away a browne dozen of Monmouth Capps or ſo, in ſea-ceremonie to your boon voyage but for reaching any Coaſt ſaue the coaſt of Kent; or Eſſex, with this Tide, or with this fleete, Ile be your warrant for a Graueſend Toſt: There's that gone aſore, wil ſtay your Admiral

Nay, and you'll ſhew trickes, wee'l vie with you, a little. My Daughter, his Lady, was ſent Eaſtward, by land, to a Caſtle of his, i'the ayre (in what region I knowe not) and (as I heare) was glad to take vp her lodging in her Coach, ſhe and her two waiting women, her maide, and her mother, like three Snailes in a ſhall, and the Coachman a top on 'hem, I thinke. Since they haue all found the way back againe by weeping Croſſe. But ile not ſee them. And for two on 'hem, Madam, and her Malkm, they are like to bite o the bridle for William, as the poore horſes haue done al this while that hurried 'hem, or elſe go graze o'the cō

I wonder I heare no news of my ſonne Goulding! He was ſent for to the Guild-hall, this Morning betimes, and I maruaile at the matter, if I had not layd vp Comfort, & hope in him, I ſhould grow deſperate of al. See, He is come I'my thought! How now Sonne? what newes at the Court of Aldermen?
               
               Enter Goulding.

                  Troth Sir, an Accident ſomewhat ſtrange, els it hath litle in it worth the reporting.

                  What? It is not borrowing of money then?

                  No ſir it hath pleaſd the worſhipful Commoners of the citty, to take me one i'their number at preſentation of the inqueſt

                  Gould.
                  And the Alderman of the warde wherein Idwel, to appoint me his Deputy—

                  Touch.
                  Now my deare, & happy Sonnellet we kiſſe thy new worſhip, & a litle boaſt mine own happines in thee: What a fortune was it (or rather my iudgment indeed) for me, firſt to ſee that in his diſpoſition, which a whole Citty ſo conſpires to ſecond? Tane into the Liuory of his copany, the firſt day of his freedōe? now (not a weeke maried) choſen Commoner? and Aldermans Deputie in a day? note but the reward of a thrifty courſe. The wōder of his Time! Wel, I wil honour M. Alderman, for this act, (as becomes me) & ſhall think the better of the cômon Councels wiſdōe, & worſhip, while I liue, for thus meeting, or but cōming

after me in the opinion of his deſert. Forward, my ſufficient Sonne, and as this is the firſt, ſo eſteeme it the leaſt ſtep, to that high and prime honour that expects thee.
               
               
                  Goul.
                  Sir, as I was not ambitious of this, ſo I couet no higher place; it hath dignity enough, if it will but ſaue me from contempt: and I had rather my bearing, in this, or any other office, ſhould adde worth to it; then the Place giue the leaſt opinion to me.
               
               
                  Touch.
                  Excellently ſpoken: This modeſt Anſwer of thine bluſhes, as if it ſaid, I will weare Scarlet ſhortly. Worſhipfull Sonne! I cannot containe my ſelfe, I muſt tell thee, I hope to ſee thee one o'the Monuments of our Citty, and reckon'd among her worthies, to be remembred the ſame day with the Lady Ramſey, and graue Greſham: when the famous fable of Whittington, and his Puſſe, ſhallbe forgotten, and thou and thy Actes become the Poſies for Hoſpitals, when thy name ſhall be written vpon Conduits, and thy deeds plaid i'thy life time, by the beſt companies of Actors, and be call'd their Get-peny. This I diuine. This I Prophecie.
               
               
                  Gold.
                  Sir, engage not your expectation farder, then my abilities will anſwer: I that know mine owne ſtrengths, feare 'hem; and there is ſo ſeldome a loſſe in promiſing the leaſt, that commonly it brings with it a welcome deceipt. I haue other newes for you Sir.
               
               
                  Touch.
                  None more welcome, I am ſure?
               
               
                  Gould.
                  They haue their degree of welcome, I dare affirme. The Colonell, and all his company, this morning putting forth drunke from Belinſgate, had like to haue been caſt away o'this ſide Greenwich: and (as I haue intelligence, by a falſe Brother,) are come dropping to towne, like ſo many Maſterleſſe men, i'their doublets and hoſe, without Hatte, or Cloake, or any other—
               
               
                  Touch.
                  A miracle! the Iuſtice of Heauen! where are they? lets goe preſently and lay for 'hem.
               
               
                  Goul.
                  I haue done that already Sir, both by Conſtables, and other officers, who ſhall take 'hem at their old Anchor; and with leſſe tumult, or ſuſpition, then if your ſelfe were ſeene in't: vnder coulour of a great Preſſe, that is now abroad, and they ſhall here be brought afore me.
               
               
                  
                  Touch.
                  Prudent, & politique ſonne! Diſgrace 'hem all that euer thou canſt; their Ship I haue already arreſted. How to my wiſh it falls out, that thou haſt the place of a Iuſticer vpon 'hem! I am partly glad of the iniury done to me, that thou maiſt puniſh it. Be ſeuere i'thy place, like a new officer o'the firſt quarter, vnreflected: you heare how our Lady is come back with her traine, from the inuiſible Caſtle?
               
               
                  Gould.
                  No, where is ſhe?
               
               
                  Touch.
                  Within, but I ha' not ſeene her yet, not her mother; who now begins to wiſh her daughter vndub'd, they ſay, and that ſhe had walkd a foot-paſe with her ſiſter. Here they come, ſtand back.

                  God ſaue your Ladiſhip; 'ſaue your good Ladiſhip: your Ladiſhip is welcome from your inchanted Caſtell; ſo are your beautious Retinew. I heare your Knight errant is trauayld on ſtrange aduentures: Surely in my minde, your Ladiſhip hath fiſh'd faire, and caught a Frog, as the ſaying is.
               
               
                  Miſt. Tou.

                  Gyrt.
                  Kneele? I hope I am not brought ſo low yet: though my Knight be run away, & has ſold my land, I am a Lady, ſtil.
               
               
                  Touch.
                  Your Ladiſhip ſays true, Madam, & it is fitter, and a greater decorum, that I ſhould curtſie to you that are a knights wife, and a Lady, then you be brought a'your knees to me, who am a poore Cullion, and your Father.

                  And therefore I doe deſire your Ladiſhip, my good Lady Flaſh in all humility, to depart my obſcure Cottage, and returne in queſt of your bright, and moſt tranſparent Caſtell, how euer preſently conceald to mortall eyes. And as for one poore woman of your traine here, I will take that order, ſhe ſhall no longer be a charge vnto you, nor helpe to ſpend your Ladiſhip; ſhe ſhall ſtay at home with me, and not goe abroad, not put you to the pawning of an odde Coach-horſe, or three wheeles, but take part with the Touchſtone: If we lacke, we wil not complaine to your Ladiſhip. And ſo good Madam, with your Damoſelle here, pleaſe you to let vs ſee your ſtraight

backs, in equipage; for truly, here is no rouſt for ſuch Chickens as you are, or birds o'your feather, if it like your Ladiſhip.

It's but hony-Moone yet with her Ladiſhip; ſhe has Coach horſes, Apparell, Iewels yet left, ſhe needs care for no friends, nor take knowledge of Father, Mother, Brother, Siſter, or any body: When thoſe are pawn'd, or ſpent, perhaps we ſhall returne into the liſt of her acquaintance.

                  Yes, Maiſter Deputy: I had a ſmall venture with them in the voyage, a Thing, cald a Sonne in Lawe, or ſo. Officers, you may let 'hem ſtand alone, they will not runne away, Ile giue my word for them. A couple of very honeſt Gentlemen. One of 'hem was my Prentiſe, M. Quickſiluer, here, & whē he had 2. yeare to ſerue, kept his whore, & his hunting Nag, would play his 100. pound at Greſco, or Primero, as familiarly (& al a'my purſe) as any bright peice of Crimſon on 'hem all, had his changable trunks of Apparel, ſtanding at liuery, with his Mare, his Cheſt of perfumd linnen, and his Bathing Tubbs, which whē I told him off, why he—he was a Gentleman, and I a poore Cheapeſide Groome. The remedie was, we muſt part. Since when he hath had the gift of gathering vp ſome ſmall parcels of mine, to the value of 500. pound diſperſt among my cuſtomers to furniſh this his Virginian vēture; wherin this knight was the chiefe, ſir Flaſh: one that married a daughter of mine, Ladefied her, turn'd two thouſand poundes worth of good land of hers, into Caſh, within the firſt weeke, bought her a new Gowne, & a Coach, ſent her to ſeeke her fortune by land, whilſt himſelfe prepared for his fortune by ſea, tooke in freſh fleſh at Beling ſgate, for his owne diet, to ſerue him the whole voyage, the wife of a certaine vſurer, cald Securitie, who hath bene the broker for 'hem in all this buſineſſe: Pleaſe Maiſter Deputy, Worke vpon that now.

It is great pitty, thou art a proper yong man, of an honeſt and cleane face, ſomewhat neere a good one, (God hath done his part in thee) but, thou haſte made too much, and beene to proud of that face, with the reſt of thy body; for maintenance of which in neate and gariſh attire, (onely to be look'd vpon by ſome light houſwifes) thou haſt prodigally conſumed much of thy Maſters eſtate: and being by him gently admoniſh'd, at ſeueral times, haſt returnd thy ſelfe haughty, and rebellious, in thine anſwers, thundring out vnciuill compariſons, requiting al his kindnes with a courſe and harſh behauiour, neuer returning thanks for any one benefit, but receiuing all, as if they had bin Debts to thee, & no Courteſies. I muſt tel thee Francis, theſe are manifeſt ſignes of an ill nature; and God doth often puniſh ſuch pride, and butrecuidance, with ſcorne and infamy, which is the worſt of misfortune. My worſhipfull father, what do you pleaſe to charge them withall? from the preſſe I wil free 'hem Maiſter Conſtable.

Do's not the ſight of this worſhipful mans fortune & temper, confound thee, that was thy yonger fellow in houſhold, and now come to haue the place of a Iudge vpon thee? Doſt not obſerue this? Which of al thy Gallants, & Gaſters, thy Swearers & thy Swaggerers, will come now to mone thy misfortune, or pitty thy penurie? They le looke out at a window, as thou rid'ſt in triumph to Tiborne, and crye, yonder goes honeſt Franck, mad Quickſiluer; He was a free boone companion, when hee had money, ſayes one; Hang him foole, ſaies another, he could not keeepe it when he had it; A pox o'the Culliō his Mr. (ſais a third) he has brought him to this: when their Pox of pleaſure, & their piles of perdition, would haue bene better beſtowed vpon thee, that haſt ventred for 'hem with the beſt, and by the clew of thy knauery,

                  Why, good faith Sinne, I could dine with a lamentable ſtorie, now. O hone, hone, o no nera, &c. Canſt thou tell nere a one, Synne?
                  
               
               
                  Sin.
                  None, but mine owne, Madam, which is lamentable inough; firſt to be ſtolne from my Friends, which were worſhipfull, and of good accompt, by a Prentile, in the habite and diſguiſe of a Gentleman, and here brought vp to London, and promiſ'd mariage, and now likely to be forſaken (for he is in poſſibility to be hangd.)
               
               
                  Gyr.
                  Nay weepe not good Sinne. My Petronell, is in as good poſſibilitie as he. Thy miſeries, are nothing to mine, Sinne: I was more then promiſ'd marriage, Sinne, I had it Sinne: & was

made a Lady; and by a Knight, Sin: which is now as good as no Knight, Sin: And I was borne in London, which is more then brought vp, Sin: and already forſaken; which is paſt likelihood, Sin: and in ſtead of Land i'the Countrey, all my Knights Liuing lies i'the Counter, Syn. there's his Caſtle now?

                  Gyr.
                  Yes, if he would liue hungry a weeke, or two. Hunger they ſay breakes ſtone wals. But he is eene wel inough ſeru'd, Sin, that ſo ſoone as euer he had got my hand to the ſale of my inheritance run away from me, and I had bene his Punke, God bleſſe vs. Would the Knight o'the Sunne, or Palmerin of England, haue vſd their Ladies ſo, Syn? or ſir Lancelot? or ſir Triſtram?

                  Gry,
                  Then thou know'ſt nothing, Syn. Thou art a Foole, Syn. The Knighthood now a daies, are nothing like the Knighthood of old time. They rid a horſeback Ours goe afoote. They were attended by their Squires. Our by their Lacquaies. They went buckled in their Armor, Ours muffled in their Cloaks. They trauaild wilderneſſes; & deſarts, Ours dare scarce walke the ſtreets. They were ſtil preſt to engage their Honour, Ours ſtil ready to paune their cloaths. They would gallop on at ſight of a Mōſter, Ours run away at ſight of a Serieant. They would helpe poore Ladies, Ours make poore Ladies.

I'm ſure I remember the time, when I would ha' giuen a thouſand pound, (if I had had it) to haue bin a Ladie; and I hope I was not bred and borne with that appetite alone: ſome other gentle-borne o'the Citie, haue the ſame longing I truſt. And for my part, I would afford 'hem a peny'rth, my Ladiſhip is little the worſe, for the wearing, and yet I would bate a good deale of the ſumme. I would lend it (let me ſee) for 40 li

Ile ſweepe the Chamber ſoone at night, & ſet a diſh of water o'the Hearth. A Fayrie may come, and bring a Pearle, or a Diamonde Wee do not know Syn? Or, there may be a pot of Gold hid o'the backe-ſide, if we had tooles to digge for't? why may not wee two riſe earely i'the morning (Syn) afore any body is vp, and find a Iewell, i'the ſtreets, worth a 100. li.? May not ſome great Court-Lady, as ſhe comes from Reuels at midnight, looke out of her Coach, as 'tis running, and looſe ſuch a Iewell, and wee finde it? Ha?
