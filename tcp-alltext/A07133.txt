               WHan that I Mary Iheſus moder ſate in Iheruſalem at the holy feeſt of ceſter alone in my hous for moche multytude of people that came to the cyte I cloſed my dores & ſate alone as I was wonte to do and thought pryuely on my ſwete ſone Iheſu where he were & what that he dyde. For on hym was all my loue and my deſyre ſet wyllynge hym to ſe. And hopynge that the euen before eeſter he wolde come to me / and beſyly I ſate prayenge my prayers & abode hym. And than ſodeynly after the ſonne goynge to reſt I herde a grete noyſe of people in the cyte cryenge as wood people / and whan I Mary Iheſus moder ſyttynge my ſelfe alone knewe not the cauſe of the grete cryenge & rennynge of the people togyder / than ſayd I theſe wordes to my ſelfe / wolde to god I were with my ſone Iheſus. A who ſhall tell me ony tydynges of my ſwete ſone Iheſu / for I drede me ſore that ony thynge of hardnes befall vnto hym / for I haue herde not longe here before that the Iewes haue cōſpired & caſt amonge them his deth. And than I Mary ſory & full ſore aferde in this maner ſate. And loked yf ony of his apoſtles wolde brynge to me ony tydynges of my ſwete ſone Iheſu. I herde anone tydynges of my ſwete ſone. I herde anone ſodeynly one ſmyte at my dore / and I roſe anone and ranne to the feneſter of my chaumbre & loked out. And whan I ſawe Mary maudeleyn clothed in blacke all bewepte & her here adowne aboute her eyen & ſayd to me theſe wordes. Come downe to me mooſt deuoute of all women mayde yt lyeſt there hydde & moder berauyſſhed of thy ſone. And than I Mary ſmyten with the ſwerde of ſorowe went downe & dyde open my dore & anone the

deuoute maudeleyne cryed to me and ſayd. A reuerende moder & mooſt reuerende of all women knowe ye ony tydynges of Iheſu your ſwete ſone and my reuerende mayſter. And than I mary moder of Ieſu full ſory ſayenge to her / knoweſt thou ony tydynges maudelayn of my ſwete ſone Iheſu. And than maudelayn all be wepte cryed to me & ſayd theſe wordes. Your ſone & your loue & my mayſter is now taken & with cordes bounden and wyckedly & cruelly of the Iewes beten & drawen. And whan I mary herde this I was anone ſmyten with the ſwerde of ſorowe thrugh the herte / & I fell downe anone to the erth as a deed woman. And whan theſe tydynges were brought to me it was the begynnynge of the nyght / & the derkeneſſe came aboute me that I wyſt neuer wheder I went / & mannes helpe had I none but as I laye al that nyght on the erth wepȳge & cryenge that heuen myght be fylled therwith / & all my hous I wette with my wepynge of myn eyen. And than I ſayd a holy fader where are thy beheſtes / why wolde yu ordeyne me to be a moder & make me ryche with a chylde / now am I bereued of my chylde & am lefte alone mooſt vnworthyeſt of all women. A aūgell Gabryell where is now yt ylke blyſſe that yu behete me / where is now ye ſomnes of grace thou behote. A gabryell why woldeſt thou ſcorne me mooſt vnworthyeſt of all moders. Beholde now Gabryell for the Ioye that yu behete me / now haue I payne & for the gladnes now haue I ſorowe / & the moderhede I am bereued of my chylde / & for the grace I haue ſhame / & for the lyfe I haue deth / & for the bleſſynge that yu behete me now is come curſe vpon me / than ſayd I to my ſelfe. A vnbleſſyd moder & ſorowful moder why woldeſt yu coueyte a chylde and bere a chylde and nouryſſhe a

childe / & ſodeynly & wyckedly arte bereued of thy childe with theſe wordes and wepynge & ſorowes & lamentacyons & wepynge of teres I ſpente ye nyght whan tyme the daye began to ſprynge & the derknes parted awaye than ſpronge a derknes for me / & than I roſe vp fro the erth as I had ben almooſt deed & faylynge all mannes helpe / & than came to me holy women of galyle that deuoutly had ben in the temple ye nyght in theyr prayers / And whan they herde that my ſone was take & cruelly boūde wt the ſeruauntes of ye byſſhop / & to me vnbleſſyd moder the holy women came with haſte me to comforte And than I ſayd to Mary maudelayne & to my ſyſters and to the holy women of Galyle. Goo we now anone that we may ſe my ſone Iheſu that is onely the cōforte of my lyfe and than myght I not go for feblenes of my body ſoo ſore I had beten it on the nyght before of my ſwete ſone Iheſu / but as the holy women & my ſyſters ſuſteyned me vp in theyr armes / & than I met wt ſome of my ſones dyſcyples wepynge to whome I ſayd thus Se ye not my ſwete ſone Iheſu. I pray you tell me where ye lefte hym. And they ſore wepynge ſayd to me theſe wordes. We ſawe hym boūde with cordes & beten with ſcourges & his face defouled with ſpyttynge and ledde forth with wycked ſeruaūtes of Cayphas to be denyed vnder Pylate / and his lokynge was pale and his chere was ghoſtly / & all his body chaunged that vnnethes we myght knowe hym. And than I Mary Iheſus moder mooſt ſoryeſt of all moders and fulfylled with ſorowe ſayd theſe wordes. A Iheſu my ſwete ſone what here I of the / what bytter and harde tydynge be tolde to me of the. And than ſayd I to ſome of his dyſcyples. May I ſe my ſwete ſone Iheſu in ony maner that I myght

haue hym out of theyr handes. And they that ſawe me make this ſorowe ſayd to me. Goo lady and tary not yf ye wyll ſpeke with your ſone on lyue / for now he is lad with armed knyghtes in to Pilates palays for ye Iewes thynke to dampne hym to the mooſt dyſpyteous dethe. And whan I Mary herde theſe wordes I was ſmyten euen thrugh ye herte with ſorowe & as a deed woman I went forth & was borne vp with my ſyſters & vnnethes myght I come to Pylates palays for faynt. And whan I came and wolde haue gone in to the palays I myght not come nye the gates for the multytude of people but as nygh as I myght I put me there & ſtode as a ſtone ſtycked in the groūde / than I caſt vp myn eyen to the foneſter of the palays yf I myght haue ſeen my ſwete ſone Iheſu / and than to the feneſtre of the palays came Pylate & ſayd to all the people. I fynde no cauſe in Iheſu why that he ſholde be put to deth wheder ye wyl that Iheſu go or barabam that is a manſleer. And whan I herde this I lyfte vp myn herte as though I had be rered fro deth to lyfe & hoped yt barabam manſleer ſholde haue be put to deth & my ſone Iheſu let go on lyue. But than I herde an horryble voyce of al the people cryenge and ſayd. Do Iheſu on the croſſe / do Iheſu on ye croſſe. And whan I herde this cryenge of the people. I was ſmyten with the ſwerde of ſorowe / & as a deed woman I fell vpon the erth ſemynge to the people yt I had ben deed & ſo I laye longe tyll my ſyſters toke me vp & comforted me / & ſo I ſtode longe there and abode yf that I myght haue my ſwete ſone Ieſu or that I myght haue ſpoken to Pylate that he wolde haue delyuered my ſwete ſone Iheſu that lothles lambe & the wycked Iewes whan they herde me crye and ſawe me wepe ſore they

blamed me ſore & badde me holde my peas thou theues moder & nouryce to this traytour: for thy ſone is worthy to be deed for he deceyueth the people / & therfore yu ſhalt ſe hym ſoone done on the croſſe before thyn owne eyen. And than anone I fell downe as a woman fallen in dyſpayre thus deſpyſed of the people. And anone I herde a voyce of ye people cryenge as they had bē wood & ſayd. Brynge out to vs Iheſus of nazareth that he were done on the croſſe. And anone pylate aſſented to them & fyrſt they bette hym wt ſcourges & thā clothed hȳ in purpure & afterwarde toke hym to the Iewes to ſpyll on ye croſſe And than they brought forth before the eyen of ye wretched moder Iheſu my ſwete ſone crowned wt a crowne of thorne vpon his heed / & his eyen all pale & his face all rede of blode & his heere of his heed hangynge ouer his eyen all bebledde & berynge a croſſe vpon his backe that he ſholde dye on / & a rope aboute his necke as a comyn thefe put bytwene two theues. And whan I ſawe this cruell ſyght than fayled I of my ſtrength & than wexed my ſorowe newe whan I ſawe hym / & for moche people I myght not come nere hym I cryed to hȳ & he myght not here me for the people that folowed hym. And than ſayd my ſyſters to me / go we mary by this way for this is the nere waye / & than we ſhall mete with your ſone & ſpeke with hym or he dye / & than I roſe vp as a woman ſtrengthed with a newe ſpyryte and wente faſt on that 
                  〈◊〉
                / & ſodeynly I mette with my ſone Iheſu in the 
                  〈◊〉
                way beringe the croſſe vpon his backe / & than ſayd 
                  〈◊〉
                
               
                  •
               heſe wordes to my ſwete ſone Iheſu. A my ſwete ſone Iheſu wheder gooſt thou ſo faſt ſo heuyly charged wt that croſſe / what thynkeſt thou to do with thy moder to let me thus alone & in dyſpayre / thȳkeſt thou to forſake

thy moder. A my dere ſone Iheſu take me to thy moder that croſſe & I ſhall bere it vpon myn owne backe / and ſone dye thou not without thy moder ne go yu not without thy moder / but ſwete ſone Ieſu let vs lyue togyder and dye togyder / & than my ſwete ſone Iheſu hauynge more ruthe on his owne moder than on his owne payne that he ſuffred / anone for ſorowe he felle downe vnder his croſſe that he bare / & anone for ſorowe of my ſwete ſone Iheſu I fell downe as a woman that had gyuen vp her laſt ſpyryte / & there were we bothe all to troden of the people / & my ſone Iheſu cōſtrayned to aryſe & go forth with his croſſe / & the wycked Iewes and cruell me the moder of Iheſu vyolently departed fro my ſone / & euerlaye my ſone vnder ye croſſe. And ye wycked Iewes cōſtrayned a man we called hym Symeon to bere the croſſe to a place was called Caluarye / & than the cruell Iewes ſmote my ſone Iheſu with theyr fete & bete hym with ſcourges & made hymſelfe bere it vpon his backe / vp at the moūt of caluarye. And thus hyed the wycked Iewes to offre vp that lothles lambe. And without all other that was my ſwete ſone Iheſu / & than I Mary mooſt ſorowfull of all moders purſued after my ſwete ſone Iheſu as faſt as I myght to ſe what deth ye lambe ſholde ſuffre that was my ſolace & my Ioye & vnnethes myght I come to the mount of caluarye / but as I was ſuſteyned by my ſyſters ſo wery & ful of woo was in my body / & by the tyme that I came to the moūt of caluary the wycked Iewes had done my ſone vpon the croſſe / & arered vp the croſſe and put it in the erth / & than loked I vpon my ſwete ſone Iheſu wt my wepynge eyen bytterly wepynge & cryenge / & ſayd to hym theſe wordes. A my ſwete ſone Iheſu / a my mooſt loue Iheſu why lokeſt

thou not vpon thy ſorowfull moder / why ſpekeſt yu not to thy ſorowfull moder / why wylte yu leue me thus alone / wheder ſhall I go my ſwete ſone Iheſu / in what hous ſhall I reſt my ſwete ſone Iheſu. A my ſwete ſone thoughe thou haue no ruthe on thy ſelfe haue ruthe on thy ſorowfull moder. And whan my ſwete ſone Iheſu herde me thus crye & wepe he caſte his eyen vpon me & vnnethes he ſayd to me theſe wordes. Womā be of good comforte for herefore I came in to this worlde & herefore I toke this body of the yt here hangeth on the croſſe to daye for to helpe mannes ſoule & to bye the ſoules out of payne that were loſt for ſynne / & therfore I ſuffre this cruell & harde paſſyon that thou ſeeſt / & therfore moder reſt now of thy wepynge & of thy cryeng / for this is my faders wyl / & alſo moder let it be thy wyll ſo in dyenge I ſhall ſlee the deth / & wt the vyctorye of my paſſyon I ſhall ryſe the thyrde day. And herefore moder take here that meane tyme Iohan my dyſcyple that I loue well let hym be thy ſone & be thou his moder / & to hym I take the to warde / for now I ſhall dye on the croſſe. And whan my ſone Iheſu had ſayd theſe wordes he caſt vp his eyen to heuen & betoke to his fader his ſoule / and ſoo with a grete crye yelded vp his ghoſt / & than I Marye fell downe vpon the erth / & all the people wende I had ben deed. And aboute ye houre of none there came cruell knyghtes and ſtode before my ſone / & one of them with a ſpere opened his ſyde and claue his herte in two / and that ſorowe clefte my herte in two. And whan my ſones ſyde was opened and his herte clouen a two / than wente the knightes theyr way. And than came Ioſeph of arinathye a noble man and a ryghtfull and wolde haue taken downe my ſwete ſone Iheſus of the croſſe / &

whan I ſawe hym I wexed quycke agayne in my ſpyryte and toke ſtrength to me and ſayd. A my ſwete Ioſeph wylte thou take downe the body of my ſwete ſone Iheſu. Now I praye the ſwete Ioſeph take hȳ downe and delyuer hym to his wretched moder that deed body of my ſone. And than Ioſeph ſayd full curteyſly to me. A mary and moder of Ieſu goddes ſone of heuen. A holy lady and aboue all other bleſſyd and euer holy. A moder and mayde and moder without wemme abyde a lytell whyle and leue thy wepynge and thy ſorowe. For I vnderſtonde yu arte bleſſyd amonge all women. And I byleue that thy ſone wyll aryſe from deth to lyfe within a ſhorte tyme. And therfore worthy lady let vs now in ye meane tyme worthely burye this holy body / for to morowe is holy daye & we may not werke. And whan Ioſeph had ſayd theſe wordes to me I was ſomwhat comforted therwith & helped to waſſhe my ſones body that was defouled with ſpyttynge betynge & bledynge. And whan we had waſſhed it we wyped it & anoyntes it / & ſo at the laſt I was ſmyten with a newe ſorowe / & than I ſayd theſe wordes to my ſwete ſone there he laye deed. A clene fleſſhe & vnwēmed that lyeſt here that were of my fleſſhe / why woldeſt thou thus dye on the croſſe & be offred for ſynne for thou arte holy fleſſhe & clene from all maner of ſynne / and thou haſt ſore bought the ſynne of all men. And whan I had ſayd theſe wordes I fell downe vpon the body of my ſwete ſone Iheſu wepynge bytterly and cryenge ſore. And than I kyſſed the woundes of his heed / & than his handes / and than his fete. And than the woūde in the ſyde / and than I cleped all the body in myne armes and kyſſed it and ſayd theſe wordes. A my ſwete ſone Iheſu I the wretched moder wende

neuer to haue ſeen this ſorowe of the nor theſe ſorowes haue ſuffred for the / but I wende for to haue had many Ioyes & neuer to haue departed fro the. And whyle I ſayd theſe wordes Ioſeph & his felawes hyed thē lyghtly to wynde & bynde my ſone in a cloth. And whan they had bounde that one partye of his body & wolde bynde that other I fell downe to the woūdes that were boūde and vnbounde them agayne & efte agayne / & than was I ſmyten with a newe ſorowe that I myght not ſuffre hym to bȳde hym of a longe tyme / & for my ſorowe & for the lamentacyon that I made vnneth myght they all yt ſtode there take ye deed body fro me / & ſo at the laſte they wolde bere hym to the ſepulture. I folowed hȳ wepȳge & cryenge wonderly ſore / & whan they came to his ſepulcre they wolde haue buryed hym anone & I myght not ſuffre that in no wyſe but mekely I prayed them in this maner & ſayd. A ye noble men & ye holy women burye not my ſwete ſone Iheſu but ſuffre me to haue my ſone a lytel whyle in myn armes that I may kyſſe hym / and whan they ſawe the grete ſorowe that I was in / they made grete lamentacyon & abode a lytell whyle ſo that at the laſt they wolde nedes burye hym / than cryed I & ſayd / burye me with hym. I may not lyue without him And than Ioſeph & his felawes departed me worſhypfully fro the ſepulcre & honeſtly & worſhypfully buryed my ſone Iheſu / & whan he was buryed I ſtode without the tombe wepynge & cryenge & fulfylled all wt ſorowe ſayd theſe wordes. A aungell Gabryell yu ſaydeſt to me hayle Mary full of grace & beholde. I am now full of ſorowe / thou ſaydeſt to me our lorde is wt the and beholde now my lorde & my ſwete ſone is put awaye fro me that I may not ſe hym. And alſo yu ſaydeſt to me bleſſyd be yu
               
amonge all women I am turmented & curſed. And at the laſte thou ſaydeſt to me / bleſſyd to the fruyte of thy wombe / & beholde now my ſone that is the fruyte of my wombe is here wyckedly ſtayne / and now lyeth here in tombe full of woūdes. And whan I had ſayd theſe wordes I fel downe for ſorowe vpon the erth / & than Iohn̄ that was charged of my ſone on the croſſe to be my ſone ſawe me thus ſorowe he toke me vp in his armes / & for febleneſſe of my body I myght not ſtonde but as Iohn̄ & other women ladde me in to Iheruſalem & as I went I turned my hede oft agayne for ſorowe that I was departed fro ye ſepulcre of my ſwete ſone Iheſu / & all that ſawe me in the way were tempted to wepe for ye ſorowe & lamentacion that I made / & than Iohn̄ led me home in to my chambre & ſayd to me theſe wordes. Now reſt here the moder of my lord vpon ye aryſynge of the ſwete ſone Iheſu and my lorde & ſeale of thy ſorowe. And lady I am gyuen to be thy ſone that am not worthy to be thy ſeruaunt. For Iohan may not be lykened to Iheſu the ſone of Zebede to the ſone of god ne the ſeruaunt to his lorde / ne the dyſcyple of his mayſter / ne no creature may be lykened to hym that made hȳ. But neuertheles my reuerēde lady I ſhall worſhyp you in all that I can with all my ſtrength ſerue you with theſe wordes and many other wordes Iohn̄ comforted me oftentymes & euer was redy me to pleaſe vnto the reſurreccyon of my ſwete ſone Iheſu. And whan we ſawe hym aryſe from deth to lyfe / than were we fulfylled wt more Ioye than they were before with ſorowe. I bleſſyd my ſwete ſone Iheſu. And thus endeth our ladyes lamentacyon with grete Ioye of goddes reſurreccyon / he graunt vs al his benedyccyon. AMEN.
