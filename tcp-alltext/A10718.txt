            ¶TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE and my very good L. Ambroſe, Earle of Warwike, Baron Liſle, of the moſt excelent order of the Garter knight, Generall of the Queenes Maieſties Ordinance, with in her highnes Realms and Dominiōs, Bernabe Rych, wiſheth long lyfe, increaſe of honor, with all happy ſucceſſe.
            
               WHEN I HAD FINISHed this little treatiſe, (right honorable) I called to mynde, the order of Wryters, who vſually are accuſtomid to dedicate their labors to ſome noble perſonage, to whome they doe beare ſome zelous afection, or any other dewtiful good wil, which example I determined to follow, purpoſing to preſent this ſame to your honor, but whē I called to my remembraūce my own ignorance in the knowledge of wryting, & the ſlender fēce of that I had wrytten, it vtterly diſcouraged me, ſo that I was at a controuerſie in my ſelfe, what I might do: in the ende, preſuming more of your Honorable & curtious inclynation, then on my owne ſkil. I haue auentured to preſent your Honor with this little booke, which I haue entituled▪ 
               A Dialogue betwene Mercury and an Engliſh Souldier, contayning his Supplication to Mars
               ▪ wherin I haue deſcrybed▪ certayne noble facts & other high exploytes, achiued by great & mighty Princes, and other valiaunt Captaines, alſo not forgetting to manifeſt the great abuſe that is generally vſed, in the ſetting forth of Souldiers, in the tyme of ſeruice which I my ſelfe haue ſeene and marked, and although I do know my ſelfe to be

the ſimpleſt of a great number, & the worſt able to performe this that I haue taken in hand, yet I haue preſumed to conſecrate the ſame & the reſt of my beneuolent mynde to your Honour, for to whome may the facts & exploytes of noble perſonages be rather offred, then to him whoſe valiaunt acts hath made him famous in his Coūtry, but in ſpecially to the ſtraunger, vvho hath felt the force and puiſſaunce thereof, to vvhom may the orders,

               eſts and courſes of martyall affayres, be more aptly remembred▪ then to him vvho can throughly deeme of ſuch labours, and hath paſſed ſo many brunts in the ſame. Moſt humbly deſiring your Honor to accept this ſame, as the baſe and barren ſtyle of a ſimple Souldiers deuice, rather then the lerned lynes proceding from ſuch as hath bene trayned vp in Scoles, beſeching God, long to preſerue your Honour, with wiſhed increaſe, and to prolong your dayes, vvith moſt happy delight.
            
               Your Honours moſt humble, at commandment Barnabe Rych.

               mytted: my good will you ſee, and I doubt not but when thou haſt peruſed the matter throughly, thou wilt perceiue my good pretence, & beare with my lacke of knowledge. As for thoſe carping correcters & curious ſcanners, ſuch as wil ſoner finde three faughts, then they be able to amende one, I may compare them to thoſe, that in the day of battaill, dare not come to the fight themſelues, but wil conuey themſelues to a hyll, or ſome ſure place to behold other mens doings, iudging who fighteth beſt, but it is an olde prouerbe, he that paſſeth through a Towne, and wyll throw a ſtone at euery cur that barketh,

ſhal haue in the ende, but a wery arme, I eſteme not therfore of thē, nor of their iudgements, but onely ſubmit my ſelfe to the friendly reportes of the wyſe and learned, and of euery other well diſpoſed Reader, nothing doubting, as I haue ſayde, but ſuch wyll beare with my inabylitie, and except of my good wyll, which is all that I craue, and thus farewell.

                  IN Maye, when all Creatures commonlye reioyce, being prycked foorth by my owne deſire to leaue the houſe, and walke the pleaſaunt Paſtures, which was to my great contentacion, by reaſon of the ſwéete and delectable Verdeur which Tellus, Imphes doth yelde in that bleſſed ſeaſon: thus as I
                  •
               romed vp and downe, I fortuned to find a fayre Meade, which was gorgeouſlye aryed all in gréeue, bedecked with Flowers of diuerſe and ſundrye collours, on the farther ſidewherof, I might beholde a gallant Gro
                  •
               e, out of the which there came ſuch Heauenlye Hermony, as at the firſt it cauſed mée to thinke Orphei againe had béene returned frequenting his accuſtomed order, but as I drewe nearer, I knewe it to bée the tunes of ſundrye Birdes, which as it ſéemed reioyſed them ſelues in that pleaſaunt plot, with their ſwéete and delectable laye: Thus as I was come vp vnder the ſide of the Woodde, I

found a faire Trée, whoſe ſpreding bowes ſhadowed the place, where I layd me down of purpoſe to heare more of thoſe pleaſant notes: but as Cyllemus mery pipe, brought Ergus to a nodding nappe, ſo I think thoſe Hermonical ſoundes yelded mée the lyke: For I was no ſoner layde, but Morpheus immediatly aſſayled mée with a ſtraunge & troubleſome dreame, for to my thinking I heard the ſodaine ſound of Trumpettes, Droms, & Phifes, & muſing with my ſelfe, what it might meane, I might ſée diuerſe bands both of Horſemen & footemen being armed, which in very comely order, with auncientes braue diſplayd, came marching toward mée, and when they were come to ye place where I aboad, putting themſelues in troupe one by the aſſent of all the reſt, vttred theſe wordes folowing: Although of this our ſodaine repaire vnto thée, thou haddeſt no intelligence, yet ſom part of the cauſe wée are aſſured thou knoweſt verye well, which ſhould make me to bée ſo much the ſhorter in that which I haue to ſay: thē know this, we haue by our general aſſents apointed thée as our truſty friend, wylling thée with al ſpeede to prepare thée in maner of a meſſenger to the mighty court of Mars:

where in our behalfe thou ſhalt make preſentacion into how many extremities wée the vnfortunate Souldiours of England are euen now lately falne into: otherwyſe then hath béene ſéene or heard on, and with a contrary alteraciō of time paſt ſo cleane chaunged, as there is difference betwéene white and blacke, hath not the name of a ſouldior here before béen had in ſuch reuerence and accounted of ſuch value, as they haue béene honoured of euery eſtate, is not the profeſſion of ſo worthy ſeruice now becom ſo odious, & the name ſo reprochful, as they be diſdained, and y• of each degrée: who hath béen heretofore more carefully prouided for, more worthily maintaind, or more iuſtly preferred: who is now ſo ſlenderlye eſtemed of, ſo lightly accounted of, & ſo litle cared for, where they haue béen loued, they be now deſpiſed, where before al other they haue béen had in eſtimatiō, they be now as abiects to al other, had in no reputacion, but what ſhould I ſtande to vſe longer circumſtance. To finde a preſent redreſſe in theſe cauſes we haue as I tolde thée before, appointed thée our meſſenger to make theſe matters knowne to mighty Mars him ſelf, who is our onely refuge, our whole hope

of comfort and chiefeſt helpe at néede, not doubting but by theſe meanes to finde ſuch happy redreſſe as wée ſhall haue iuſt cauſe to extoll our mighty Mars, as alſo to yeld the continuall thankes for thy diligence vſed at our requeſtes.
            Thus when I had heard the ſum of their pretence, I aunſwered as followeth: If I were as ſufficient to diſcharge my ſelfe of that credite, whiche you would committe vnto mée, as I fele my ſelfe wylling and readye to the vttermoſt of my power to pleaſure the ſimplyeſt of this noble company, as the hope that you haue in mée ſhould not bée fruſtrate, ſo I ſhoulde not bée dryuen to ſéeke excuſes, as nowe I am forced, requeſting your pardons herein: Fyrſt, becauſe I knowe there bée many whoſe experience wyll much better ſerue to ſatiſfye your requeſtes, than I knowe my owne to bée of, and there bée ſome that I knowe would accuſe mée of ignoraunce or preſumption, if it were knowne that I ſhould attempt in any ſuch matter, but in eſpeciallye when I conſider my owne inſufficiencye, it vtterlye diſcourageth mée: But I rather thinke your Meſſage

ſhoulde bée executed by ſome famous Oratour, or ſome excellent Rethoriſian which ſhoulde not bée vnfurniſhed with pleaſaunt tearmes, or ſuch a one as could tell a learned tale as occaſion dyd ſerue, and not by ſuch as I knowe my ſelfe to bée, who is able to ſaye no more than what you haue already taught mée: Wherefore I truſt you wyl except theſe as reaſonable & lawful excuſes, and not as any ſurmiſed ſhifts, whereby to auoyde that ſeruice whiche I knowe my ſelfe to bée vnworthy of.
            When I had made this anſwere after a lytle conference had amongſt them ſelues, thy replied in this manner.
            As wée thinke thée ſufficient ynough to performe any thing that wée haue yet deſired, ſo wée are not come hyther eſtéeming thée beſt able of any other to ſatiſfye our requeſt: but wée preſuming to haue found thée as wylling to haue vſed thy dilligence, at our deſires, as wée were ready to deſire thée, gaue vs the more occaſion to preſſe thus much vpon thée, and where thou ſayeſt there bée ſome that woulde accuſe thée of ignoraunce or preſumption, if thou ſhouldeſt yelde to our requeſtes, wée

aſſure thée there be as many others that might Iuſtly accuſe thée of folly yf for the reprochfull tauntes of Momiſhe mates, thou ſhouldeſt omit any thing that tendeth vppon good or commendable occaſion, but what nicite hath nowe ouertaken thée, that thou wouldeſt perſwade vs to ſende ſome Oratoure or ſuch lyke, and that we muſt nowe vſe ſuch eloquence to preferre our cauſes: thou muſt conſider we woulde neither ſend the to Pallas nor yet to Apollo, nor yet to any other captious wight that will haue greater regarde to the termes, then he hath to the tale, for who is ſo ſcrupilouſe that will looke for eloquence to come from ſouldiers or to thinke that they muſte paynt out their matters with any curiouſe philed phrace, vnleſſe it be ſome curiouſe philed foole, which knoweth not what appertayneth to a ſouldier, but to driue thée oute of theſe doubtes wée haue framed a ſupplication to Mars, wher in wee haue included the whole ſircumſtaunce of oure pretence the which in oure behalfes thou ſhalt preſent, receyuing thy anſwere without vſing many words: thus minding to vſe no farther perſwatiōs of

incouragement if this that we haue ſayd be not ſufficient we leaue the reſt to thy owne diſcretion.
            Yes ſurely ſayd I, it is ynough and youre wordes hath ſo throughly perſwaded me that euen now I remayne at youre pleaſures redy preſt to aunſwere the ſum of your pretence, as far as my abilitie will any wayes ſerue me, yet crauing the pardons of ſuch as be beter experimented conſidering it rather procéedeth from a deſier to do wel, then of any preſumtuoſe minde. Then they deliuering me the ſupplication which they had framed, one of them ſayde as foloweth.
            Well then we minde no lenger to deteine the but woulde rather wiſhe the to make as great ſpéede as conueniently thou mayeſt: we haue no more to ſaye but we deſier the ſacred Gods to farther thy pretence and thus till oure next méeting we leaue thée.
            Then putting them ſelues agayne in order, too my farewell, certayne voll of ſhot diſcharged in hope of my good ſpéede.
            Thus they marched awaye againe in ſuch

gallant ſort, that who had ſéen them might well haue déemed (though their eſtimacions were impaired,) yet their noble and valliant harts was no whitte diminiſhed: But ſodainly as they were vaniſhed from my ſyght, I began to bethinke mée of my vndertake, attempt, which when I had well conſidered, I curſed my owne follye that would ſo raſhlye condiſcende to take in hande, I knewe not what: for neyther wyſt I where Marſes Court ſhoulde bée, neyther knew I by what deuiſe I might get thyther, the remembraunce whereof brought mée almoſt to a kinde of deſperaration, how I might proſecute, or by what meanes I might performe my promiſe: but when I had called to minde the goodneſſe of the Gods, who commonly bée aſſiſtaunt to all diſtreſſed wightes: I began ſomwhat to comfort my ſelfe in hope, likewyſe to finde ſome fauour vſyng this peticion as followeth, If the humble ſupplications of wretched wights, may any thing preuayle before you, the celeſtiall Gods vouchſafe moſt humblye than I beſéeche you, that my pytyfull plaintes might ſo moue you to helpe mée in this diſtreſſe,

that through your mighty powers, and prouidence deuine: I might yet in the ende bring my attempt to ſome happy effect.
            But as I continued in this contemplacion I might beholde one ſtanding by mée clothed all in white, holding in his hande a rodde, which ſéemed all of maſſye Golde, by which ſigne I dyd knowe it to bée Mercury, who in this wyſe ſayde vnto mée.
            The Gods hath liſtened to thy prayers, and in ſome part yelded to thy requeſt: aryſe therefore and with ſpéede prepare thy ſelfe to followe mée, with that me thought on both my ſhoulders there were ſodainly growne a payre of winges of maruailous bigneſſe, and as I perceiued my guyde ſoftly to ſoare awaye, I aſſayde with my ſelfe howe I coulde followe, whiche mée thought I could doe euen at pleaſure, and as well as though I had beene practiſed in flying many a daye before, and after wée had thus flyed a whyle togeather, I looked about, and I might vnderneath mée beholde Cityes, Townes, Caſtelles, Wooddes, diuerſe Hylles, and Valleys, wherein I tooke great pleaſure and delight and muche reioyſed with my ſelfe to ſée

theſe newe and vnaquainted thinges but with in ſhorte ſpace we were ſo mounted that I had cleane loſte the ſight: of altogether which was belowe and then I might perceiue a merueilouſe, huge and ſumtiouſe Caſtell, ſtanding on a pleſaunt plotte directly ouer againſte vs, toward the which my guide began to bend his courſe and I following hym till we were come in manner to it, where vpon a very fayre gréene we ſtayde oure ſelues,Marcial exerciſes. and as I ſtoode gaſing aboute I might perceiue greate rowts of people that iſhewed out and in at the gates and almoſte on euery parte of this caſtel they were vſing many exerſiſes ſome were running at the tilte, others at the turny others were puſhing with the pike, ſom were throwing of the dartes, ſome were exerciſing the Caliuer in manner of ſkirmiſhe, and many were on horſebacke, the one hauing the other in chace,
            Theſe ſightes made mée greatly to muſe, but my guide I thinke of purpoſe to cut mée from my farther imagination, ſayde: Loe,The diſcription of Mars his Court. here quod he the Court of Mars, where thou mayſt beholde thoſe bleſſed wightes, who ſpent theyr paſſed dayes in defence of

theyr Countrey and right, onely to attaine prayſe and noble fame, and not for filthye lucours ſake, or hope of any Golde gaine: Where nowe their iuſt deſertes is quitte with like delight, what though their bodies intombed bée in clay thou ſéeſt their ſpirite doe here remaine in euerlaſting bliſſe, for here no yeres may make thē olde, no barehead ſkul, no wrinkled browe may here be found, no viſage here may ought anoy thē, nor yet Morpheus once aſſayle them, no Borias blaſtes may hurt them with cold, nor the fiery flames of Aetna hyll oppreſſe them with heate, no Cerberus is Porter in this place, nor the grieſlye grones of Promotheus at no time here are hard, they neuer ſée the gréedy gripe to tyer on Ticius heart, to bée ſhort they neuer féele of any woe: but ſtyll continue their daies in moſt happy and bleſſed eſtate, euerye one vſing his owne delights, euen as it hath pleaſed the Gods to appoint. Why then ſayd I thou Godes ſōne ſith it hath pleaſed thée to reueale theſe matters vnto mée, vouchſafe lykewiſe (I beſéech thée) to ſatiſfye mée in this that I ſée vpon the Towers and Tur

               ets, which as they bée innumerable, ſo

they are beſet with an infinite number of Auncients: In the which as I do geſſe, the Armes of diuerſe Countreys be diſplaid: But on the one part of the Caſtle, I maye beholde diuerſe Auncientes, bearing the Armes of Englande, they bée lykewiſe invironed with a great number of others, al bearing Saint Georges Croſſe, yet in them the Armes of noble men and Gentlemen, & amongſt them many which my ſelfe dyd partlye knowe, nowe it ſéemeth vnto mée, thoſe Auncientes ſhould pertayne to ſuch as were valliaunt Princes, couragious Captaines, and expert Souldiours, and that their Armes and coullors bée there diſplayed, in ſigne of their immortal fame, and that as well of the inferiour Gentleman, as of the moſt mightye Prince.
            Thou haſt rightly deamed ſayd the God, and lyke as thou ſéeſt their Armes and coullours aduaunced in the toppes of the Towers, ſo their noble actes and valliant Conqueſtes bée liuelye deſcribed on euery wall within that Princelye Pallace, to their perpetuall remembrance: But now with ſpéede prepare thy ſelfe to finyſhe thy pretence? beholde the place where thou

mayſt performe the reſt of thy deſyres, go thy wayes therefore, and at thy returne thou ſhalt not fayle to finde mée here aſpecting thy good hope.
            I wyſt not then howe to requite the curteſey of the God, nor yet what reuerence I might vſe at my departure, in the ende with a homelye manner of geuing thankes, I tooke my leaue directing my courſe towardes this glorious Court, and as I ſoftlye paſſed gaſing here and there, I might perceyue a great company of Gentlemen all brauely mounted on horſeback, who for their diſports were running at the King: amongſt whome there were ſome that I my ſelfe had very wel known and perfectlye againe had called to my remembraunce as I ſawe them ryde: The firſt of them was Captaine Dercy, brother to the right honourable Lord Dercy, whoſe ſouldiour I ſometime was at New Hauen, where the Gods aſpecting his vertuous diſpoſition bereft vs of this noble Gentleman, although to our griefe and ſorrowe yet to his continuall comfort and conſolation, where hée now hath reſydence amongſt the moſt renowned wightes.
            
               There were in his company Captaine Sanders, and the valliaunt yong Souch, whome I lykewiſe had knowne at Newhauen, with many others.
            But when I was come neare to the gates of this Princely pallas, it made mée much to muſe to ſée the ſtrangeneſſe of the ſight, for beſide that it was huge, and of a maruailous Cirquet, ſo the order of fortification was ſo excéeding aboue the cōmon forme of any humane ſkyll, as I wyll not preſume to take vpon me to diſcipher.
            
               The deſcription of the wales.The walles were all of braſſe, impalde with maſſy Gold: in euery port and lope were Canons coucht that gliſtered like the Sunne. The Porter that kept the gate loked with a moſt ſtearne and grieſly countenance: his name they ſay was Courage, by whome I paſſed into a baſe Court, the bewty whereof was ſuche as it ſhewed it ſelfe to bée a place to farre vnfitte for any mortal wight. There were about ye walles in moſt liuely maner diſcribed many worthy Cumbats, & diuerſe valiant conqueſts atchiued by ſundry marciall wightes, as Giants, ſerpents, Dragons, Lions, Buls, Boores, & many other horrible monſters, ſubdued by Hercules, Theſeus, Iaſon, Perſey,
               
and others.
            From thence I paſſed into an vpper court which was of ſuch excellency, as it eaſelye might be déemed to bée a place celeſtiall. There was lykewiſe deſcribed many famous Hiſtories: firſt I ſaw ye ſeege of Thebes, where Amphion ſanke down into hel, & of many a knight which loſt their liues before the auncient towne of Troy, & how by treaſon, the braſen horſe was ſet on flaming fire. thē might I ſée the ouerthrow which Hanibal gaue to ye 
               Romaines in Cā
                  nas field, where Conſull Emmelius laye bathing al in blood, & of many a notable policy put in practiſe betwéen the ſaid Hanibal, & Scipio, & how before Carthage they were in armes to try who ſhould haue ye Empire of the world: then ſaw I Xerxes, whoſe army though for ye multitude they dranke riuers dry, yet was cleane ſubdued, & quite ouerthrown, & how by the valiance, & proueſſe of ye noble Milciades, iij.C. thouſād men were put to flight: yet ſaw I Darius with all his huge hoaſt, ſubdued by Alexander ye great, I might likewiſe behold diuers noble conqueſtes which were atchieued by ſondrye Engliſh Princes & other valiant captains & ſouldiers of Englād, to long here to be reherſt,

but al next to the entry into the Hall, there was curiouſly deſcribed ye victorious actes of the moſt renowned Prince, King Henrye the eyght, howe he diſcomfited the whole power of France at the time of the ſéege of Turwin, when as he retayned the Emperour Maximilian with all his retinue: who came to the campe wearing, a red Croſſe as one of the Kinges ſouldiers and after howe the towne was taken and left all raſed: then ſawe I Turnay ſurrendred to the King, and of many a noble exploit done before the ſtrong and forcable towne of Bullein and howe it was likewiſe taken by this noble Prince.
            Theſe with a nomber of other hiſtories were there ſo liuelye diſplayed all in Imagery of pure goulde ſo curiouſly inamiled as they rather ſeemed to be euen nowe a doing then the monumentes of thinges, that were done and paſte. And as I was determined to haue gone into the hall, I hearde a greate noyſe of trumpets, ſownding in manner as they vſe to doe at triumphes: and as I looked towarde the gate, I might behoulde a goodly perſonage that was entering, who for hys Ieſture

countenaunce, and euery other grace, ſéemed to bée euen the God of battaile him ſelfe, hée brought with him foure Champions, all armed, ſauing on their heades they had eueryone a Garland in ſigne of victorye, and as I earneſtly ſtoode and beheld them, I called thrée of them perfectly to my remembrance, for that I ſometime had knowne them: The one was Captain Vahan, ſometime Controuler of Newhauen, the other Captaine Cromwel, and the thirde Captaine Rondall: the fourth I dyd not knowe, which cauſed mée to go to one that ſtoode by, of whome I curteouſlye deſired to knowe who this fourth ſhoulde bée, who in this wyſe ſayde vnto mée.
            Why, what art thou quod he, or how long haſt thou béene here a Courtier, that doeſt not yet know the noble Captaine Audley, whoſe proueſſe and valiaunce, as it hath made him famous to euery inferiour perſon, ſo hée is lykewiſe honoured of each renowned wight.
            Why then quod I, vouchſafe lykewiſe I praye thée, to ſhewe mée the meaning of the reſt from whence doe they come, or

what is the cauſe that thus bée brought in manner of victors, or as though they had atchieued ſome haughty attempt.
            By thy wordes quod hée, it ſéemeth thou art yet vnaquaynted with the manners of this houſe, otherwiſe theſe matters would not ſéeme ſuch nouelles vnto thée, when it is generallye vſed by as many as doth frequent this place for their owne diſportes, to put in practiſe ſundrye experimentes, and diuerſe Marciall exerciſes, where hée that beſt deſerueth ſhall receyue ſuche honour as is dewe to his deſertes, as nowe theſe foure Gentlemen which at this preſent hath ſhewed them ſelues at all aſſayes, more worthy then the reſt, and bée now brought in by Warlyke Pollicye, who is hye Stewarde of this houſe in this triumphant manner, by whome they ſhall receyue that honour which to them of right by cuſtome doeth pertaine: when hée had thus ſatiſfied my demaund, and that I dyd know him to bée Warlike Pollicy, which before I ſuſpected to bée Mars.
            
            I requeſted his aduiſe what meanes I might vſe to come to the preſence of the

God of battaile, ſhewing him that I had a ſute to prefer, and that I was in déede a ſtraunger and wanted friendly aduiſe.
            Well quod hée, if that bée thy want, the beſt aduiſe that I can geue is this, that if thy cauſe require any haſte, it were good thou madeſt ſpéede to the place where thou mighteſt haue quicke diſpatch,Mars 
                     〈…〉
                   nowe in Venus court. which is not here, for Mars is now in Venus court whither thou wert beſt to repaire, the ſooner to know an ende of thy deſire.
            When I vnderſtoode this I was ſo at my wittes ende, as almoſt I knewe not what to doe, but when I had geuen him thankes for his courteſey, I had thought to haue gone againe to my guide, who had promiſed to tarrye for me to requeſt farther aduiſe, but firſt I went into the hall, where there was ſuch a thundring noyſe of trumpettes, Droms, and Phifes, as was maruailous to heare.
            In the middeſt of this Hall there ſtoode a Wagon, the which was called the Chariot of deadlye debate, there was painted about it many tragicall diſcourſes, and ſundry Ciuyll diſſencions: I might ſée the great controuerſy betwéene Iulius Caeſer &

               Pompey, which coulde not bée appeaſed with the lyues of thrée hundred thouſand men, lykewyſe betwéene the houſes of Conde and Guiſe, and alſo betwéene the houſes of Lancaſter and Yorke, with many other which here I omitte.
            There was ſitting in this Chariot, thrée perſonages moſt terrible to beholde: the firſt was Warre, who ſate all armed holding in the one hand aſword, & in the other conſuming fire: hée was accompanied with Famine on the one ſide, a moſt horrible creature, whoſe yrkſome lookes were able to daunt the greateſt courage of the moſt haughty minded wight: on the other ſyde ſate Murther,

            This Charriot was euer drawne by foure ylfauoured and vnſéemely monſters whoſe names were Mallice, Strife, Contencion, and Diſcorde, the Wagoner was moſt peſtelent ſlaue, called Enuye, who with a Goade dyd ſtyll pricke them forewarde: But as I paſſed vp a litle farther, I might beholde that moſt vglye and deteſtable creature Ruine, whoſe dreadefull ſight dyd muche afraye my maſed minde:

This monſter Ruine is euermore a follower and a hanger on of Warre,Ruine

                   warre. for into what place ſo euer Warre maketh entrye or hath any abiding, Ruine preſently followeth, and there lykewiſe wyll make his reſidence.
            Thys yrkſome ſight dyd ſo much abhorre mée, and ſo throughly diſcourage mée, that where before I had a kinde of Martiall deſyre to ſerue as a Souldiour, as occaſion dyd permitte, I nowe proteſted to my ſelfe not onely to leaue the exerciſe of ſo vyle a profeſſion, but alſo to deſeuer my ſelfe from the fellowſhip of any ſuche as were followers of ſo filthy and hatefull a ſeruice, minding no farther to folow my ſute, whiche before ſo carefullye I ſought to accompliſhe, but got my ſelfe foorth to my guide of purpoſe to deſyre him to bring mée to the place, where at the firſt hée dyd finde mée, and ſo to leaue mée.
            But becauſe it ſo chaunſed, we fell into a diſcourſe of many matters: I haue put it in order of a Dialogue, for that it might bée the better vnderſtoode.

               As my returne ſéemeth to thy Godhead to bée quicke and ſpéedye, ſo the horrible ſight which I haue ſéene ſithens my departure, ſéemeth to me as fearefull, and diſpleaſaunt, and for that I vnderſtand that Mars is nowe in Venus Court, I can bée well contented euen there to leaue them, and thus to ceaſſe my ſute, conſidering the fruictes of their ſeruice which dyd firſt procure mée to take the matter in hande.

               Euen of this when I nowe haue plainely ſéene what fruites by warre are gayned, both by him and his accomplices. Firſt the Chariote of deadelye▪ debate, drawne by mallice, ſtrife, contencion and diſcorde, driuen by enuie, fraught with ſword, fire, famine and murther, making open ſcope and waye for ruine, is Pluto himſelfe aſocyated with a more lothſome companye? no ſure the Furies of Hell are not to bée compared to theſe monſters aboue all other moſt to be deteſted.

               War in déede amongſt mortal men is gréeuous, ſwiftly to bée ſhunned, but it

is many tymes vſed as the ſcourge of the Gods to puniſhe the Malefactions of the impius, and therefore not to bée auoyded, example of Troy and Troyeans brought to deſtruction onelye for the filthye facte of Paris, but touching the Souldiour, becauſe hée is an inſtrument of Warre, and therefore ſhould bée reiected, might as well bée ſayde, becauſe fire whoſe nature is to conſume whatſoeuer it toucheth, and therefore ſhould bée vtterlye extinguiſht, and cleane put out, yet no man doubteth but if it were ſo as in Summer, it woulde bée wanting about dyuerſe neceſſaryes, ſo in Winter a great number might ſtarue for colde.
               A Souldiour maye rightly bée compared to a ſword, wherewith a man maye for want of gouernment anoy his companions, indaunger ſuch as bée about him, hurt his friendes, yea, or maine, miſchiefe or kyll him ſelfe, where at the firſt they were ordained as neceſſary inſtruments, wherewith to defend the enemye, which elſe would ſéeke thy lyfe, and to reuenge thy wronges, and iniuryes, which be offered

by thy Foe, nowe if they bée otherwiſe abuſed contrary to the meaning of the firſt inſtitucion, the faulte is not to bée imputed to the ſworde, but to the follye of ſuch as for want of gouernment can not vſe them, neyther may ſwordes yet bée ſpared, but to bée accounted as inſtruments moſt neceſſarye.
               But what ſhoulde I ſtande to vſe examples, how many Cityes, Townes, Prouinces, yea, & ſometime whole kingdomes hath béene rewynated and vtterly confuſed where ſouldiours hath béene wanting, but here omitting all other: I will yet refer thée to pervſe in Chronicles, the time that Brithricus raygned King of England, in whoſe tyme the Danes firſt entered his Lande, robbed and ſpoyled many of his Succeſſours, and in the ende brought the people to bée ſeruile and bond, vſing theyr wiues and goodes at their pleaſure, & thus continued the ſpace of two hundred fiftye and odde yeres, to be briefe, I thinke there is no man ſo ſimple which doeth not conceyue how neceſſary and néedeful the noble Souldiour is.
            
            
               Soul.
               The more is the pitye, that Kinges

and Princes can not foreſée vnto how many miſfortunes they commit them ſelues, their people and countrey, when they firſt take in hande to prepare them to the field, which if they dyd, I thinke they would rather deſire to gouerne their owne with quietneſſe, than to ſéeke by force of armes to bée conquerours of others: But O vnhappy Prince, that is ſo vngracious to imbrace ſo curſed a crewe as warre bringeth with him: but O thriſe vnfortunate countrey and people, that harboureth ſuch a company of vnluckye Geſſe.
               
                  Wars hath beene from the beginning, and ſhall continue vntyll the worlds ende.Well yet thou ſéeſt warres hath béene euen from the beginning, and ſo ſhall continue to the ende, eſpeciallye when there be ſo many prouocations to ſtyrre them, and ſo many vyces imbraſt almoſt of euery Prince to mooue them, as Ambicion, Pride, Vaineglory, Blooddineſſe of mind, Couetouſneſſe, and ſuch other, theſe bée the chiefe occaſions of any forraine warre, ciuyll warre is likewiſe procured, when the Prince is rygorous, cruel, a tyraunt, ouercharging their ſubiectes with Taxes, Subſidyes, vnreaſonable cuſtomes, or other gréeuous exactions, and as theſe vices bée

general in Princes, ſo there are as many mo as common to ſubiects, wherby many times cōmocions are rayſed, as contempt, rebellion, diſobedience, mutiny. &c. And yet warres are not wrongfully attempted but many times proued vpon ryght and reaſonable cauſe.
               Thou ſéeſt the noble Souldiour may in no wyſe bée ſpared,Souldiers maye not bee ſpared if it bee but to defend the inuaſions of others. but euen as thou haſt ſayde vnhappy Prince, and vnfortunate Countreye that once retayneth wars, ſo mayſt thou likewiſe crie, O moſt wretched Princes, and O moſt miſerable Countreye whiche is vnprouided of ſufficient and expert Souldiers, if it be but to defende the rigours of ſuch as would inuade.
            
            
               Soul.
               In déede we haue a ſaying, that Weapon many times maketh peace, and ſo paraduenture where the Countrey is well repleniſhed with Souldiours, and other neceſſaries appertayning to warre, maye bée an occaſion that the enemye wyll bée the more cyrcumſpect to ſtyrre any ſtryfe, thus I perceyue the Souldiour is verye neceſſarye, but yet in my

                  Howe many commodities are gained by the ſouldyer.Beſides this in what ſecurity eyther of lyfe or liuing were thoſe that be honeſt

and of good diſpoſition were it not for law, to what effecte were lawe, were it not for Iuſtice, of what aſſuraunce were eyther Lawe or Iuſtice: were not the Prince to maintayne them, of what maintenance or power were that Prince that were bereft of ſouldyers, for is it not many times ſéene, that neither Iuſtice, policy nor wiſdome, maye longer continue obedience in ſubiectes towardes their Prince, but muſt be ſubdued by force of martiall power: to be ſhort in what aſſured ſtate were that Prince or country, which is vnrepleniſhed with noble ſouldyers to defend them from the tyranny or others.

ſeemeth the ſouldyer muſte geue place to the wiſe and politique counſailer.
            
            
               Mer.
               To aunſwere this obiection ſufficiently woulde aſke to long diſcourſe and no man doubteth but the ſouldyer in all attemptes is or ſhoulde be gouerned by counſaile vnleſſe occaſion doeth ſometyme fall oute when hee muſte put in practiſe hys owne experience,Who can giue better counſayle in Marcial cauſes then the experimented Souldiour but who is able in anye occaſion touching marciall cauſes, to giue better counſayle than the experimented Souldiour, as Alexander magnus ſayth, a Souldioure is worth hys kéeping in the tyme of peace who hath honeſtely ſerued bys Prince in the tyme of warre although for age hée can not trauayle, his counſayle yet maye not bee ſpared.
               But to ſhewe thee in part what counſaylers they be which Cicero meaneth, and how the ſouldyer doeth giue him place, I will ſhewe the.
               
                  Cato perceyuing the Romaynes to degenerate and waxe ſluggiſh, ouer they had bene in times paſt, and in ſtede of feats of armes exerſiſed other vayn toyes & other

ydell deuiſes, fearing that by this nicitye, the Carthagians might take occaſion to contende with them for the empire, brought it in queſtion that for their better ſecuritye it ſhoulde bee moſte conuenient that Carthage shoulde bee vtterlye deſtroyed, although that Scipio were of the contrary opinion, affirming that it ſhoulde ſéeme verye vnlawfull for the Romaines to committe ſo heynous a fact, but hée rather thought it to be moſt expedient that the Romaines hauing ſuche an enimie whome they might feare, might bee the more occaſion to continue peace and amitye amongſt themſelues, and the greater prouocaſion whereby to incite theyr youthe to proweſſe and actiuitye, in concluſion, Cato preuayled, and Scypio after a long aſſaulte, did take it, and vtterly deſtroyed it.
               Thus by the counſayle of the wiſe Cato Rome was deliuered of a daungerous neyghboure, but the glorye and renowne remayned onelye to the Noble and valyaunt Captayne Scypio, in manye ſuch lyke cauſes, Souldiours gyueth place

to the counſaile of the wiſe, but is nothing thereby diminiſhed, but the rather increaſed and augmented.
               But becauſe thou mayſt the better perceyue in what eſtimacion the noble Souldiour hath béene a
                     •
                  counted of and howe their counſailes hath béene allowed with wyſe and noble Princes,How olde Souldiers hath beene accounted of with noble princes. I wyl ſhewe thée an example the which in auncient hiſtoryes is yet to bée ſéene, in theſe wordes following.
               
                  Dioniſius when he went to Conquere other Regions, there were many of his folowers which being ouercome with age and extreame trauaile, woulde neyther tarrye without a King, neyther followe their Captayne, wherefore comming to their Prince with Teares, they deſired him to take pittye of them, to whome hée ſayde: My brethren and fellow ſouldiers laye your cares a ſide, you haue followed mée a great while, you haue often and long fought for mée, and with mée, I wyl nowe call others into their fortunes: It is now time for you to take your reſt, and this ſhall remaine a reward for euer, for your labours and trauailes, ſettle your

ſelues here and poſſeſſe you this fat Land, whiche by your valiaunce I haue Conquered, I doe nowe releaſe you from all Warrelike laboures: I wyll haue you to carrye the name of oulde Souldiours, and to bée called here as your office ſhall bée to gouerne the common Weale, to reproue the yll, to prayſe the good, and from all other laboures you ſhall be frée to what people or countrey ſo euer you come too, the King ſhall finde you meate Drincke and Cloathe, you ſhall bée moſt honourable with all menne, Princes ſhall offer you preſents, and ſhall geue you theyr owne Garments, what ſo euer you ſaye ſhall bée allowed for trueth: You ſhall hate Lyers, and you ſhall iudge Traytours, and thoſe that haue yll Women you ſhall puniſhe with infamy: the whole Lande ſhall be frée for you to haue ſafe trauayling, and ſafe dwelling, if any man ſhall offend or gréeue you with worde or déede, hée ſhall dye by the ſworde.
               I doe farther appoint that my verye friende Spertembam ſhall bée Kynge of the Indies amongſt you, who ſhall appoint

you neceſſaries and yerely ſtipendes who ſhall maintayne your priuiledges, and hée ſhall holde you moſt honourable about him, and you and your heyres ſhall counſayle him, in whome if ſucceſſion ſhall want: let the election of the Indian Kinges bée amongſt you, and your Children.
               
                  It is to bee ſuppoſed Herroldes of Armes toke the original of this.Thus Dioniſius comforting and perſwading his Heroas, departed with his army out of India, whoſe office is to bée aſſiſtaunt to Kinges, to bée a comfort to the common weale, to aduaunce vertue, and to puniſhe vice, being no other of them ſelues but olde Souldiers, the which after many and greate miſchiefes endured, and after many wonderfull Warres ended with moſt glorious Triumphes, there ſtrength drawne from them, & tyred with age, are releaſed from the toyling labors of warres, and called to the court for counſaylers.
               
                  Octauius Auguſtus was of the ſame mynde, and ſo lykewiſe was Marcus Anthonius, and Marcus Craſſus: Thus the Romaines when there Warres were ended, dydde ſtyll determine of their olde

Souldiours.
               But why ſtaye wée ſo long about ſo ſmall auayle, if thou mindeſt to proſecute as thou haſt begonne: beholde Venus Court is not ſo farre hence, but that wée may walke thyther euen at our pleaſures debating on theſe cauſes by the way as wée goe.

               Sou.
               I doe not vnderſtand the meaning of theſe wordes, but I perceyue they tend to ſome diſlyking, whiche although peraduenture ſome ſmall abuſe may bée committed

in the choyſe of our Souldiers, yet for Captaines I thinke there bée none admitted but ſuche as iuſtlye maye not bée accuſed of any inſufficencye.
            
            
               Mer.
               Then omitting to ſpeake of ſouldiers tyll ſome other occaſion, I wyll ſome thing ſaye of twoo ſortes of Captaines, whiche in tyme of ſeruice are as buſye as the beſt to attaine charge, and as it is greate pittye that the one ſorte ſhould bée parmitted, ſo it were very good if the abuſes of the other might bée reformed, and the greateſt cauſe that ſtirreth both theſe ſortes to ſeruice, as maye be ſuppoſed, procedeth of one mocion, which is the gripell deſyre they haue of Princes paye.
               The firſt ſort which I meane bée ſuch as wyll preſume to take vppon them conduction being altogeather vnable and cleane voyde of experience,Vnfit captaines. no not ſo much as to place twoo hundred men in right order of araye.
               The other bée ſuch, which although they be ſeruicable inough, yet in the time of ſeruice wil make a cōmon profit by powling and pilling his Souldiers, yea, & ſomtime

wyll not ſticke to deceyue the Prince by a ſlye deuiſe or twaine: Such Captaines in times paſt there hath béene appointed, and ſuche Captaines bée moſt readye to make meanes to bée appointed, and it is nowe growne to a generall order in Englande, that in the time of ſeruice, hée that can beſt carrye fauour with this or that noble man, hée is ſufficient inough to take charge, there pertaines no more to a Captaine, but if hée may get my Lordes good wyll by meanes whereof there hath béene ſome appointed which if they came to the place where good ſeruice ſhoulde bée, ſome were to farre vnfitte to performe the duetye of a Captaine or elſe ſuch whoſe greateſt care is howe hée maye deceyue both Prince and ſouldier of the paye.
            
            
               Soul.
               Although it hath pleaſed thy Godhead to enter into this familyer diſcourſe, yet before I wyll preſume to procéede any further, I craue moſt humbly pardon, leaſt peraduenture in vſing many wordes ſome happe to bée amiſſe, for that euerye honeſt minde of dutye is bound as much as in him lyeth to defende any infamye or reproche, wherewith his Countrey is charged, ſo it

might fortune that I in reſpect of God wyl to defende thoſe accuſations whiche here thou haſt pronounced againſt our Engliſhe Captaynes, might fall into ſuche raſhe reaſoning as myght not well beſéeme mée, and ſo forgette that reuerence whiche to thy Godhead by right doeth appertaine.
            
            
               Mer.
               As I am well pleaſed at this inſtant to argewe and debate theſe cauſes with thée, ſo it ſhall nothing diſlyke mée, for any thing that thou ſhalt ſaye, but woulde rather wiſhe thée to ſpeake fréelye, whatſoeuer thou thinkeſt maye beſt ſerue for thy purpoſe.
            
            
               Soul.
               Then I doubte not but to make ſuch reaſonable anſwere in our Captains behalfes, as may very well be permitted for good and ſufficient excuſes, and nowe to ſpeake of thoſe firſt kinde of Captaines which here thou condempneſt to be preſumptious, becauſe they wyll attempt to take a charge: notwithſtanding, theyr ſmal experience thinking the greateſt mocion, that ſhould ſtyrre them to it, procéeded of deſire, of gaine, nowe it might bée very wel ſuppoſed, that if any Gentleman

haue ſought that place of credite: it rather procéeded of valiaunce, or of a noble courage, then of any couetous deſire, or yet of any preſumtious minde, for noble hearts vndoubtedly can but deſyre noble atempts and I am aſſured wée haue no ſmall number of Gentlemen, whoſe experience peraduenture, though it bée not ſo muche as ſome others, which hath ſéene the order of ſeruice, yet I dare bouldlye affirme theyr noble and valiant hearts are no whit inferior, no not to thoſe whoſe experience doth beſt ſerue, and whoſe ſeruice hath béene of longeſt continuaunce, & the noble captaine Cabrias (as ſtoryes maketh mencion) was wont to ſaye that an armye of fearefull Deare, hauing a Lion to their Captaine, were more to bée feared, than an army of Lions hauing a deare to their captain. By this he aſcribeth valiance to be the principal point that to a captaine appertaineth: and Saluſt ſayth, that wytte and wyll ioyned togeather, maketh a man valiant, and who would thinke that any ſuch ſhould be vnwylling, that in the time of ſeruice wyll make ſo many friendes to get a captaines roome.
            
            
               
               Mer.
               But nowe if any ſuch haue ſought that noble Ronne, which are in déede neyther wyſe nor valiaunt, and that are mencioned vnto it, by wyll without witte, although theſe maye bée hardlye excuſed of hope of gaine yet of preſumpcion, hée may not bée excuſed or at the leaſt hée maye bée worthily condemned of ouermuch folly.
            
            
               Sou.
               This is moſt certaine it can not otherwiſe be, but I thinke wée haue no ſuch in England.
            
            
               Mer.
               As I wyl not ſéeme to accuſe, ſo I doe not minde to excuſe, but bée it in England or elſe where, he that wyl take vpon him the roome of a Captaine, without hauing experience, doth playe Phaetons part, or may bée compared to ſome raſhe felow, who at aduentures wyll take vppon him Marriners art, and yet was neuer at the Sea, fearing nothing but bearing all his ſayles ataunt while the wether is fayre, and at length comes ſome ſodaine ſtorme or vngracious guſt that turnes Ship and all on their heads, ſometime paraduenture for want of making ſayle when time dyd ſerue, ſome contrary winde or vngracious tyde maye hoyſe to ſome Rocke or Sande,

whiche the ignoraunt man knoweth not howe to auoyde.
               So many times a ſkilleſſe Captaine may ouerthrowe himſelfe and his company by making to much haſte, ſometime ſuffer his friendes to periſhe for being to ſlacke, for be he neuer ſo valiaunt in his owne perſon, or neuer ſo wiſe in other cauſes, yet if he haue not experience to knowe the time and place wher hardineſſe maye preuayle, and howe hée ſhould beſtow his ſtroakes in time and place conuenient, through pollicy it is prouided that ſtrength may bée ſubdued,Pollicye of more effect then force or ſtrength. and many mo fieldes haue béen loſt for want of pollicy, than for want of ſtrength, and many Townes wonne by ſlightes, where force coulde not preuaile, and euen as if Cato himſelfe would take vpon him conduction of a Ship without good and ſufficient experience, as I truſt it were no blaſphemy, to ſay that Cato were but a foliſhe Pilate, ſo hée that wyll take a charge without knowledge to gouerne it,No wiſedome for a man to take vpon him that he can not ſki

                   I truſt wyl not bée offended though he be learned: an vndiſcréete Captaine, for wiſedom wylleth no man to make attempt of that whiche he is not able to compaſſe, but in eſpeciallye

in ſo daungerous a cauſe, where through the defaute of one ignorant Captaine a whole army may ſomtime be ouer throwne, whereon may depende the ſtate of a Kingdom, and the ruine of a countrey.
               Neyther is 
                     •
                  e to bée eſtéemed coragious or yet valiaunt, that wyll ſo wylfully take vpon him to rule, and ſo ignorauntly ſéeke to gouerne, but rather to be accounted wilfull and fooliſhe hardy.
               But nowe ſomething better to perſwade thée, what a captaine ſhould be, I wil ſhew thée diuerſe opinions: firſt Cato ſayth, that captaine is ſtarke naught which cānot rule him ſelfe, than hée is much worſe, that not knowing howe to rule him ſelfe, wyll yet take vppon to gouerne others: Iſocrates ſayth, the greateſt vertue in a ſouldiour, is obedience toward his captaine, but if ſuch Captaines might bée permitted, Iſocrates was deceyued: for an vnſkilfull Captaine, may haue a ſkylfull Souldiour, and then the greateſt vertue in a captaine were obedience towards his ſouldier: Cirus King of Perſia was wont to ſay, that no man ought to take vpon him to gouerne vnleſſe he bée better than thoſe that he taketh vpō him to rule. Alexander, when he tooke vpon him

the Conqueſt of the world, admitted none to haue charge that were vnder thrée ſcore yeres of age, onely becauſe he would haue none to bée leaders that ſhoulde bée ignoraunte or vnſkylfull: for Socrates ſayeth, the bouldneſſe of the ignoraunt ingendreth many euils: And Ageſilaus ſayth, the lacke of experience cauſeth the lacke of courage.
               Thus thou mayeſt perceyue that ſuch as were wyſe, would not permit any ſkilleſſe or ignoraunt Captaine.
            
            
               Soul.
               But yet in my mind it were great pitye, that Gentlemen ſhould thus bée diſcouragde, for euerye man muſt haue a beginning, and euery man muſt haue a tyme to learne before he may come to bée a ſouldiour, and how ſhould a man come ſoner to practiſe, then by ſéeing of ſeruice, & ſuch as be Gentleman paraduenture wyl diſdaine to ſerue vnleſſe as a captayne, which place if it ſhould bée denied them, might be a hinderāce to their wel diſpoſed mindes, geuing thēſelues from ye noble profeſſion to folow ſome other idle deuiſes, which elſe might proue to be noble and worthy ſouldiers.
            
            
               Me.
               
                  Ageſilaus ye king of the Lacedemoniās
                  
being but a Childe, when ſolemne Games were plaide for the exerciſe of children, in which hée that had the ordering & rule therof, had apointed him but to a meane part & roome, albeit he were the heire aparent to the Crowne, ſayd in this wiſe, good inough, for I wyll ſhewe that it is not the roome that dignifieth ye perſon, but it is the perſō that dignifieth & renowneth the roome.
               So it is not the roome of a captaine that dignifieth the vnworthy perſon who is not able to execute it, but it is the valiaunce of him that is appointed to the place that dignifieth and renowneth the roome.
               But if there be any that bée ſo preciſe that would thinke they ſhoulde ſo muche imbaſe their credite, if they ſhould ſerue vnleſſe as a Captaine at the firſt daſhe, I muſe they can not as well conceyue what a mockery it ſhould bée when they come in the place of ſeruice, when they ſhall be found to bée but vſurpers of the name, and ſcant able to execute the roome of a ſimple ſouldier.
               
                  The opiniō of a Spaniard Italiā & Frencheman.The Spaniard who for the nobleneſſe of his minde is far ſurmounting aboue all other, yet if he be the ſōne & heyre of a Duke hée wyll not take vppon him to conducte others,

before he hath firſt ſerued and thereby learned experience howe to order his charge aright, the Italian is lykewiſe of the ſame minde.
               The Frencheman vſeth this prouerbe, that he wyll not take vpon him the roome of a Captaine, before hée bée able to commaunde his ſouldier, and not his ſouldier to commaund him.
               Thus thou mayſt perceyue that amongſt ſuch as bee dayly practiſed in ſeruice, it is thought great follye in him that wyll take vpon him the roome of a Captain, and not able to execute it.
            
            
               Soul.
               Peraduenture if Warres were as generall amongſt vs, as it is amongſt them, as the Gods forbid it ſhoulde, wée would learne no obſeruations, neyther of Spaniard, Italian, nor Frencheman, they ſhould be no ſpectacles for vs, for vſe they ſay makes perfectneſſe, and amongſt them warres are ſo generally frequented, that it were great ſhame if they ſhoulde be ignorant in any obſeruatiō, order, or diſcipline.
            
            
               Mer.
               It is as great ſhame that the orders of armes and diſcipline of warre ſhoulde be vnknowne to any Gent. though he neuer came where ſeruice was,the diſiplin of war to be lerned without goinge to the filde. yet hée

ſhould not bée ignoraunt in the lawes and orders of Armes, which are to bée learned without going to the field, as may appeare by Alfonſus King of Aragon: who being demaunded whither hée were more bound to his Bookes then to his Weapons and armes, anſwered, out of my bookes I haue learned boath armes, and the order of armes: and dyd not Lucullus by the ſtudye of his Bookes, become one of the nobleſt Captaines of all the Romaines.
               So there bée many bookes the which if Gentlemen would ſometime vouchſafe to peruſe, would throughly inſtruct them in ſuch obſeruacions as were vſed by the moſt renowned Captaines and Souldiers, to the great furtheraunce of ſuche as minde to ſerue, & to what exerciſe may a Gentleman better indeuour himſelfe vnto them, to learne to ſerue: for as Vigeſius ſayeth, the way to winne honour is rather to practiſe in tyme conuenient the art of Warre, then to winne treaſure, and lacke experience, leaſt he ſhould ſaye, why haue I not learned to ſerue and defend: and Gelo King of Silice, at a certaine banquet, when according to the vſe of the Countreye, the Lute was caryed from one to another, in order

for that amongſt the Gréekes it was counted a thing of great commendation to him that coulde vſe it well, but when it came to the Kinges courſe to playe, hee commaunded that his Horſe ſhould be brought into the banquetting houſe, and forthwith hée eaſely and lightly leapt vpon him, ſignifying that although the Lute were a deſent Paſtime to be vſed by Gentlemen, for recreation, yet hée ſhewed that Chiualrye was more to be commended and before all other exerciſes principally to be preferred.
            
            
               Soul.
               And maye a man then learne to bée a perfecte Souldiour that ſhall ſéeke no other experiment, but as he ſhall bée directed by his Booke? I haue heard this reaſon many times before, but I coulde neuer yet bée perſwaded to beléeue it, and yet there bée ſome which by that experience only wyll take vpon them as they ſay them ſelues, to vſe any derection in the fielde, and in as good order as hée that hath ſerued twenty yeres a ſouldiour.
            
            
               Mer.
               But I woulde wyſhe that ſuche a ſouldier might rather bée beléeued by his owne reporte then to ſuffer him to make tryall of his cunning before his enemy in

the fielde, and although it be moſt certaine that the practiſe of many bookes maye bée greatlye beneficiall to the knowledge of martiall affayres, ſo there is no kinde of ſickeneſſe, neyther any manner of diſeaſe that is incident to man, but in bookes there are ſuch certaine and approued medicines as the beſt Doctors will alowe of, yet hée were a deſperate pacient, that in an extremitie of ſickeneſſe, woulde followe the aduiſe of him that hath but reade onelye, and neuer had other practiſe. The Mariner at the Sea, when by force of weather hée is driuen to ſome vnknowne coaſte, then to knowe the place hée is in, and from thence to ſhape his courſe, hath no other helpe, then the Coſmographiere hath preſcribed vnto him, which rules although they be moſt certaine to worke by, yet a wiſe man woulde be loath to be caried to Sea by him that hath no other ſkill than his coſmographie onelye, yet notwithſtanding as it ſhoulde be great furtherance to him that woulde practiſe Phiſicke to pervſe other mens opinions, which hath write touching the nature of Herbes and Plantes, and as it ſhoulde bée muche avayleable and for hys redyer

vnderſtandyng that woulde be a Nauigator, to ouerſée ſuch rules as are preſcribed by the Coſmographier concerning the art, ſo he that woulde be a ſouldier and one of Mars his troupe, ſhal finde it moſt commodious, as wel to helpe his memorie as alſo to kindle his courage, to reade of martiall feates, apparteyning to the purchaſing of honorable victories, fame, and renowne.
               And lyke as I would not wiſhe him that hath but read of Phiſicke, to take vpon him to miniſter to the diſeaſed, ſo I woulde not aduiſe him that hath but booke experience, of hym ſelfe, to vſe any order or appoyntment although his counſayle in ſome cauſes may very wel be folowed.
               And as I knowe that by certayne rules of Arithmaticke a man maye ſodaynelye frame any maner of battayle of any proportion, the number of men once beyng knowen, or to knowe what cirquet of grounde wyll ſerue to inbattayle ſo many men, with ſuch like, ſo it is poſſible for him yt is deſyrous in a very ſhort ſpace, to pervſe in bookes the manner of any warres, which hath ben theſe many hundred yeres, & by what meanes many noble victories

hath ben obteyned, and what pollicies hath bene vſed by ſuche as were famous Captaynes, ſome to aſſawght, ſome to defend, &c. But yet he that ſhoulde ſée but one field fought, ſhall gayne more experience then the other by readyng of all thoſe bookes.

               but now concernyng thoſe ſeconde ſort of Captaynes, whiche thou ſayeſt, be ſuch as by ſleyghtes doth deceiue ye prince, and pyll his Souldiers in the tyme of ſeruice, I thinke there be none that be ſo vnkynde to his prince, that wyl practiſe ſuche deceypt, nor ſo vnnaturall to his countrey men, to ſéeke the hynderaunce of his poore ſouldiers, whom they ought as carefully to prouide for, as they woulde doo for them ſelues.

               They ſhould doo ſo in déede: but it hath ſometyme otherwyſe fallen out, and poore ſouldiers hath ben by deuiſes, cut frō theyr wages which the Prince hath allowed them, and to deceiue the Prince it is a ſmall matter accompted of amongſt ſ

                  me, and by a generall ſhyft they vſe, whiche is to want of his number of men whiche the Prince geueth allowaunce, for ſuche Captaynes, by report there hath bene, and it

were not amiſſe, if the practiſe were not ſo common.
            
            
               Soul.
               I thinke there be none whoſe conſcience is ſo large, that can for pities ſake, ſéeke to deceiue his ſouldier, and as for deceiuyng of the Prince, if it be by no other meanes then hath bene yet expreſſed: I thinke may eaſily be aunſwered, for I haue knowen them myſelfe that haue wanted of their number of ſouldiers, but yet not of purpoſe to deceiue the Prince, neyther yet to enryche them ſelues by ſauing of theyr pay, for if they haue wanted ten or twelue of theyr number whiche they haue ben allowed for, they haue yet had twentie or thirtie Gentlemen, to whom they haue geuen doubell paye, the better to maintayne them ſelues in the Princes ſeruice, and the rather to incourage both them and others to ſerue, for it is generally ſéene, that a Gentleman wyll ſooneſt prooue a ſouldier of any other, and ſhewe hym ſelfe moſt valiaunt in the fielde: and when Xerxes king of Perſia, was in manner put to the worſe, but of .300. Lacedemonians where he hym ſelfe had with a very great multitude, he confeſſed hym ſelfe deceiued, in that he

tooke with hym many men, but fewe ſouldiers, for he perceiued that it forced not ſo muche howe many there be, as howe well aſſayed, picked, and tryed they be, and it may be, that theſe Captaynes be of Xerxes mynd, they had rather bring ye ſmaller nū
                  ber of choſen ſouldiers, then the greater companie of ordinarie men, as they be appoynted.
            
            
               Mars,
               although this excuſe ſéemeth to be reaſonable, yet for ſome cauſes it is not tollerable, but yet as thou ſayeſt ſufficient yenough to pourge them from any pretended deceipt towards theyr Prince.

               And who woulde ſuppoſe that any Captayne woulde ſéeke to deceiue his ſouldier, on whoſe report hangeth the greateſt part of his credite, for what greater infamie may come to a Captayne, then to be defamed by his own ſouldiers, and ſuch as hath ſerued hym.
               But it hath ben the cuſtome in England, as I haue heard, that in the tyme of ſeruice in what Shiere ſoeuer ſouldiers were leuyed, theyr Captayne, was lykewiſe appoynted in the ſame Shiere, ſome Gentlemen of great worſhip, and of fayre reuenewes

who had ben able, if cauſe had ſo conſtrained, to haue ſerued the Prince, and rather would haue ſpent a thouſand pound amongſt his ſouldiers, then to haue ſought to defraude thē by any manner of meanes, this gaue ſome incouragement to men, when they dyd knowe theyr Captayne to be of countenaunce amongſt them,The reputacion of the Captaine cauſeth obedience in ſouldiers. it dyd lykewyſe bréede due obediēce in ſouldiers, when they were in the warres, theyr Captayne beyng ſuche a one as had gouernement amongeſt them, to miniſter iuſtice when they were at home in the tyme of peace, to be briefe, it cauſed euery one to endeuour hym ſelfe to vſe his beſt ſeruice, and to pleaſe his Captayne, to the ende that when the warres were fyniſhed, it lay yet in the Captaynes poſſibilitie at theyr returne, to requite them eyther with good or ill accordyng as they had deſerued.
               The Captayne lykewyſe when he conſydered who they were that ſerued vnder hym, and that he remembred them to be his neyghbours, and ſuche as were dwellers about hym, yea peraduenture manye of them his owne tenauntes, he for his owne credites ſake, and to auoyde defamation,

would ſo order him ſelfe towardes them, as they ſhoulde haue no cauſe to exclayme, this by report, hath ben the order tyl nowe of late, and in my ſimple iudgement it were very neceſſarie if that manner of appoyntment were ſtyll obſerued.

               but nowe thou muſt conſyder the alteration of the tyme, for in thoſe dayes Gentlemen were as deſyrous to become ſouldiers, as they are nowe ſtudious to become Lawyers: but it is nowe come to an other paſſe▪ for in the tyme of ſeruice there are very fewe,Note. whoſe experience may ſerue them to take charge, but ſuche as are partly conſtrayned to it by néede, then where the Captayne is néedie, and the ſouldier more néedy, there muſt néedes fal out ſome abſurditie in ſeruice, and by theſe meanes the orders of ſeruice in the warres are altogether corrupted, and a great way from the auncient manners altered, whereby hath growen theſe ſiniſter opinions, which maketh men to hate warlyke ſeruice, and to flye the conuerſation of ſuch as doth profeſſe it.
               And as for the greateſt parte of ſuche as be indued with worldly poſſeſſions, hath a

further deſyre to folowe other vayne and idell deuiſes, then they haue to ſerue and defende theyr countrey. If they fynde the Prince a horſe to the field, they thynk them ſelues to haue bene at great coſt, and it is done ſo grudginly amongeſt a number of them, that they cared not if he myght paſſe muſters, yf he were not able to go a myle out of towne, ſuche is their impudencie as they haue no reaſon to deſerue of thynges apperteynyng to theyr owne ſecuritie.

with ſo greate ſorow, hée cried and named Solon, thē 
                  Creſus drawing a great ſigh anſwered in this wiſe: Solon ſometime amongſt ye

But to thys aunſwered Solon, rebuking me for my ſecure and careleſſe mynd, and ſayd, no man in this world, (O King Creſus,) is ſo happy and fortunate in this life, that he can be called throughly in euery parte bleſſed, before he dye, neither is there any man I aunſwer thée, be he neuer ſo mightie, but ſome aduerſitie may chaūce vnto him, and ouerthrow him, or hée be aware, but at that time truſting retchleſly (alas) vppō my happy luck, and ſuckceſſe of things, deſpiſed his words, neyther could I feare this ſo exceding a fal as now I fynde: wherefore bicauſe firſt I vnderſtode the ſentence of Solon, now before my death I named him, and I do wiſh all men in proſperitie, not to be vnmindful

               Although ther be many other examples, which could not bée preiudiciall for Captaines to note, & to haue in remembraūce, yet here I let them paſſe, remēbring thée but with this one example of Fabius Maximus, he hauing certayne of his Souldiers taken by Haniball, ſent to the Senators for money to redéeme them, his ſute being denyed, commaunded his ſonne to go ſtraight to Rome, to ſell all the landes and liuing which he then poſſeſt without the City, and to bring him money, wherwith hee redéemed his Souldiers, and brought thē franke & frée to Rome ſaying, he had rather want patrimony in his countrey, then loue to his countrey men. And now hauing ſomething ſhewed how a Captayne of him ſelf ſhould be adicted, which as L. Paulus ſayth, ſhould

be to be aged, and aunſient in maners.
               Now it foloweth how a Captaine ought to trayne and practiſe his Souldiers, and although I know experimented Captains,How Captaines should inſtruct their Souldiers. nede no ſuch inſtructions, yet for thée, or other, that be young Souldiers, it can not be hurtfull.
               A Captayn ought firſt to teach his Souldiers, how to kepe the order of aray, and to inſtruct them, that they may know how to march, to learne them to vnderſtand the ſounds of Drums, and Trompets, wherby they are commaunded what they ought to do, and bicauſe it chaūceth of ordinary, that when men be redye to ioyne in fight, they come to gither with great ſhoutes and rumor, by reaſon wherof ye cōmaundementes of the Captaynes, may not many tymes be hard, nor vnderſtand: it is therfore requiſit to make them to obey to ſignes, as by caſting his armes a broad, when he wold haue them to march wider, by bringing his armes to gither, whē he would haue them to march cloſe, by holding vp his hand, when he would haue them to ſtand ſtill, by turning him ſelfe towardes them, if he would haue them turne, and thus to inſtruct them

how the fight is begunne, how they ſhould retier, and being ouerthrowne, who ſhould ſucſéede in their places, and thus to make them practiſed which more auayleth then ſtrength and multitude, as maye appeare by Marius, who being at his liberty to choſe one of the beſt Armies hee would, eyther that which had bin with Metellus, or that which had ben Rutilius, he choſe the leaſte which was Rutilius Army, bicauſe it was thought to be the better trayned.
               
                  Epaminondas Captayne of the Thebians with 4000. trained men, ouercame the Hoſt of the Lacedemonians, in which was 24. M. footemen, and 16. hundred horſemen. 14. M. Greekes, which number came to help Cirus againſt Artaxerxes ouercame in battaile .1. C.M. Barberouſe Aliens.
               
               Therfore I ſay that Captaynes ſhould vſe great diligence in ye trayning of their men, conſidering that an Army is not to be choſen for the multitude, or bicauſe in ye ſame be hardy men, but bicauſe they be wel trained, and in their orders wel apointed: thus hauing practiſed his men redy for to fight, it ſhould be well done then, if time or place might ſerue, to bring them to ſome lighte,

ſkirmiſh with their enemyes for their better encouragement, and to make thē know the better what to doo: but yet as neare as they may, to choſe ſuch a place as their ſmal experience may not be hurtful vnto them.
               But héere omitting to ſpeake of ſkyrmiſhes, becauſe they be diuerſly vſed, and vppon ſundry occaſions procured.
               I will ſhewe thée now, what obſeruations were vſed by ſuch as were noble Captaynes, before they would attempt to procéede in battayle, and by what inuentions they haue eſcaped, when they haue bin daū
                  gerouſly beſet, and how by many deuiſes they haue attayned diuers noble vyctories. &c.
               And firſt to ſpeake of their opinions, concerning to ioyne in battayle, it was a generall vſe, amongſt ſuch as were the beſt aproued Souldiers, neuer to bring their mē to fight, except they had aduantage, or elſe brought to it by conſtraint.
               The aduantage groweth as wel by the ſituacion of the place, as by order, or hauing of more and better men.
               The neceſſitie groweth whē they ſhal perceiue

by deferring of battaill, it muſt nedes fall out to theyr great diſcommoditie, as when famiſhment wer redy to aſſayle thē, or when the enemy looketh for ſome new ſupply, or ſuch lyke, in theſe cauſes it wer to attempt Fortune wher ſhe may fauour, rather then by deferring, to ſée theyr certayne rewine.
               
                  Vygeſius counſayll is, neuer to bringe an Army to fight, except they hope to haue the victory, for what greater ſigne is there to loſe, then not to beleue to be able to win, wherfore to encourage Souldiers to fight, theyr hath ben ſundry practiſes.
               
                  Exāples of incouragement.
                  L. Sylla, in the wars againſt Archelaus Mithridates léefetenaunt at Pirea, perceiuing his Souldiers had lyttle courage to fight, he ſo weried them with continual labour, that they wer glad to deſyer to fight, that the wars might be finiſhed.
               
                  Cyrus king of Perſia, mynding to concitate the myndes of his people, to wery & anger them, with payneful labour, held thē all one day at worke and vtterly tyred thē, in hewing vp a certayne Wood, on the morow after he made for them a very plentitious feaſt, demaunding in the feaſt tyme

which day lyked them beſt, and when they all alowed the paſtime of the day preſent, and yet (quoth he) this pleaſure muſt be obtayned by the other dayes payne, for except you firſt ouercome the Medes, ye can neuer lyue in fréedome and at pleaſure, wherby they toke great courage to fyght.
               
                  Q. Fabius, who knew very wel the Romaines to be of ſo lyberall and honeſt nature, that by diſpightful and contumelious dealings, they would be ſone moued, vexed and gréeued, loking alſo for no ryght nor equall dealings of the Percians, who were his enemies, ſent vnto Carthage Imbaſſadours to intreat of peace, which was conſented vnto, vppon certayne condicions, which when they wer brought and perceiued to be vnreaſonable, and full of pryde, the Romaines army was ſtrayght ſtyrred and incouraged to fight.
               When Ageſilaus had pight his fielde, not far from Orchomeno, a Citie that was in league with him, and perceiued that many of the Army had their treaſure & chéefe ryches in the Campe, he commaunded the Townes men to receue nothing into the Towne belonging to his Army, to the entent

his Souldiers might fight the more fiercely, knowing they ſhould fight both for their liues and goods.
               
                  Fabius Maximus fearing that his Hoſt would not continue the fight manfully, by reaſō they might quickly fly to their Shippes, commaunded they ſhould be ſet on fire before he would begin the battayle.
               When Ageſilaus had taken certayne of the Perſians, whoſe aport was very terrible as long as their clothes were on, he ſtriped them ſtarke naked, ſhewing their effeminate bodyes to his Souldiers, to the ende they might deſpiſe them.
               
                  Gelo. the Tyran of Siracuſe, entring war agaynſt the Percians, after that he had taken many of them, brought forth the weakeſt, and moſt vncomely perſons naked, in the ſight of all his Army, to perſwade them that they wer but wretches, and men worthie to be deſpiſed.
               Some haue conſtrayned their men to fight through neceſſitie, taking away from them all maner of hope, of ſauing themſelues, vnleſſe they did ouercome.
               Shame hath ſometime conſtrained Souldiers to fight agayne afreſh, that haue byn

redy to haue geuen ouer.
               As when M. Furius Camillus beholding his Armye to ſtagger, and ſtande at a ſtay, caught violently the Standerd bearer, and drewe him with his handes vpon his enemyes, when verye ſhame made the reſt to followe.
               Likewiſe L. Silla when the Legions reculed & gaue place vnto Mithridates Hoſt, led by Archelaus with his Sword drawne, ranne forth into the foreward, and called to his Souldiers and ſayde, if any man inquyre of you, wher you left your Captaine, aunſwer fighting in Boetia, for ſhame wherof, they folowed him.
               But yet the greateſt incouragemente that may bée vſed, is by perſwaſion, for that effecte of ſpeakyng to hym that hath knowledge to perſwade or diſwade, preuayleth more then any other thyng, to kyndel the myndes and humayne paſſyons of a man, it taketh away feare, it increaſeth obſtinateneſſe to fight, it diſcouereth deceipts, promiſeth rewards, ſheweth ye perils, & ye way to auoyd thē, it reprehēdeth, praieth, thretneth,

it incourageth the myndes and fylleth full eyther of hope or elſe diſpayre, as might apere by Epaminondas, who being redye to enter battayle with the Lacedemonians, to the ende, that the ſtrengths of his Souldiers might be holpen with ſome feruent affection, he pronounced in his Exortation, that the Lacedemonians had determined, if they gat the victory to ſlay all their men, to make theyr wyues and children bonde for euer, and to beat downe the Citie of Thebes flat to the ground, with which wordes, the Thebians were ſo moued and agreued, that at the firſt brunt, they ouercame the Lacedemonians.
               
               
                  NoteIt is lykewiſe much requiſit for Captaynes to know the diſpoſition of the Captayne of the enemies, whether he be raſh, or politike, whether he be fearful or hardy, whether he be more puiſant with footemen or with Horſemen, whether he wyll aſſayle thée in the Euening or in the Morning, and ſo to prouide for themſelues.
               When Hanibal dyd perceiue that Fuluius the Romaine Captaine was negligent, and that he attempted many thinges vnaduiſedly, in the dawning of the day the

myſt being ſomewhat thicke, and the Ayer much obſcured, he made a few of his ſouldiers to ſhew themſelues to thoſe that kept watch in the Romaines Tents, while Fuluius adreſſed him thetherward with hys Hoſt. Hanibal on the otherſide inuaded his Campe, and ſo brake out in the back of the Romaines, and ſlew theyr Captaine, with viii.M. of their valiant men of Armes.
               
                  Alevvred King of Brytaine when the Danes wer entred his Realme, of purpoſe to vnderſtand their orders, put himſelfe in ye habit of a Mynſtrel, & by theſe meanes, he came into their Campe, wherby he toke occaſion to geue them a great ouerthrow.
               When Iphicrates of Athens, had knowledge that his enemies dyd eate at one certayne tyme of the daye, he commaunded that his men ſhould take theyr repaſt ſomwhat more tymely, then ranging forth in battayl at the ſame inſtant that his enemies ſhould haue falne to their victuals, he ſo delayed them, that he neyther would geue them battayle, nor yet ſuffer thē to depart, when it drew towardes night, hée reculed back againe, but yet keping his men ſtill in their Harniſe: but his enemyes being

weried not only with long ſtanding, but alſo with long faſting, made haſt to refreſh them ſelues, and to take their repaſt. Iphicrates agayne, brought forth his Army, and ſet vpon his enemyes, whom he found all vnredy, and out of order.
               It behoueth a Captayne in ſome cauſes as much as in him lieth,Pollicy in Captains for ſome cauſes to forbeare to fight. to abſtayn from fight, that is, when eyther famiſhment or other naturall neceſſities, hath brought the enemy into ſome vtter deſperation, which cauſed the Lacedemonians being certified by their ſpyes, that the Meſſenians wer ſet on ſuch a rage as they came to battayle with their wiues and children, which cauſed the Lacedemonians to defer the fight.
               Likewiſe when Caeſer in the ciuil war, had incloſed the Hoſt of Affranius and Petriens, within a Trench that they were pyned with thirſt: inſomuch that they became deſperate, deſtroying all that would withſtand them, or profered with them to fight, which Caeſer perceiuing; kept in his men, ſuppoſing it not méete time then to begin.
               But now to ſhew vppon how manye occaſions noble victoryes haue bin attayned,

it would aſke to long diſcourſe conſidering they be ſo infinite, yet for that many tymes it hath bin found to be of great importaunce during the time of fight, to ſpred certayne rumors,How many victoryes haue bene obteyned. affirming the Captayne of the enemies to haue bin ſlayn, or to haue ouercome, on the other ſyde of the Armye or ſuch lyke I will not forget: conſidering it hath bin the cauſe of many victoryes to ſuch as hath vſed it.
               
                  Iugurth in the battayle agaynſt C. Marius by the ſame policy made the Romaines to recule, ſo did Mironides of Athēs againſt the Thebians, wherby he got the victory.
               When Valerius Leuinus fought againſt Pirrhus and had kild a raſcall Souldier, he held vp his Sword all blody, and made both the Hoſtes beléeue that hée had kyld Kyng Pirrhus, wherfore his enemyes ſuppoſing them ſelues to bée deſtitute by the death of their Captayne, all abaſhed with that lye, gaue ouer the fight. Whē 
                  Claudius ye Emperour of Rome, came to recouer tribute of Gwider, King of Britaine, who in the ſtead of tribute gaue vnto hym ſtronge

and forceable battaile, Hamo a Romayne Captayne, Arming him ſelf, in a Britaines Armour, by meanes wherof, he came wher Gwider the King was, and flew him, which being perceiued by Aruiragus the Kinges brother, tooke on him the Kinges Cognoſcaunce, and thus being taken for the King, continued the fight, whereby hée obtayned the victory againſt the Romaines.
               
               When a Barbarouſe Alien in battayle, had broght word to Q. Sextorius that Herculeius was ſlain, he ſtraight ſlew him with his dagger, leaſt he ſhould haue borne thoſe newes any farther, & diſcouraged ye Army.
               One ſpeciall regard ought to be had amongſt Captaines, when they be in fight, which is not to bring the enemy into any extreame deſperacion, or ſo to incloſe them, that diſpair ſhould cauſe thē to fight, which cauſed Haniball,
                  Not good to bring the enimy into deſperation. when he had incloſed the Germās at Traſimenus, by which cōſtraint they fought exceding fercely to opē his Army, and to make them away to get out, beating them downe as they fled, without any loſſe of his owne men.
               The lyke vſed, L. Marcius a Romayne Knyght, when hee had incloſed the Carthaginēces
                  
and ſo did Ageſilans with the Thebans.
               
               When Themiſtocles had vanqiſhed the power of Xerxes, he would in no wiſe agrée, that the Bridge ſhuld be broken, ouer the which they ſhuld returne ſaying, it wer better to driue them out of Europa, then to inforce them to fight in deſpayre.
               Captayns ſhuld haue regard with what order they folow, for he that with his people diſparted purſueth his enemyes,What regard ſhould be vſed in the purſute. may hope to geue his enemies the victory, as appeareth by Q. Fabius Maximus Conſul, being ſent to ſuccour the Sutrines agaynſt the Hetruſciens, ſo ordred the matter, that whē the whol power of his enemies ſet againſt him, then deſembling as he feared them, and as though he fled, got the higher groūd, the other folowing him out of order, were by him not only vanquiſhed, but alſo bereued of theyr Campe.
               The lyke reſpect ought to be vſed,What diligence ſhould be vſed after a victory obteyned. by ſuch as ſhould fortune to be Conquerours, and not through affiaunce of their victory, to leaue them ſelues diſordered, leaſt it might happen vnto them, as happened to the Percians, for whē 
                  T. Martius a Romain Knight

being gouernour of the reſidue of the Hoaſt that remayned after the death of the twoo Scipyons, perceiued that the twoo Hoaſtes of the Percians lay at hand, not many miles a ſunder, he incouraged hys Souldyers to ſet vpon the Hoaſt that laye nexte hym, at midnight, being careleſſe and out of order through affyaunce of their victory, & flewe them, leauing not ſo much as a meſſenger to beare tidings of the miſerable miſchaunce, and then geuing his Souldiers a litle ſpace to reſt them, the ſame night with all ſpéed preuēting the fame of any thing don, inuaded the other Army, and thus twice in one night enioyed like chaunce of battaile, and euery wher diſtroying the Percians, hée reſtored Spayne againe to the Romaines.
               
               And now for the better ſafetie of the purſued,Exāples of ſuch as hath ben purſued. & to cauſe ſuch as folow to ſlack their purſute, Triphon King of Syria vſed this meane to ſcatter money by the way as hée fled, which ſo hindered Antiochus Horſemen that purſued him, that he therby eſcaped. When the Gaulls ſhould fight with Attalus, they deliuered all their Gold and Siluer to be kepte of certayne men that might ſcatter it abrod, if it happened them

to be put to flight, to the intent they might the more eaſly eſcape their enemyes, being let with the gathering vp of the pray.
               When Q. Sertorius was put to flight of Quintius Metellus Pius, he ſuppoſed not a thing ſure ynough onlye to flée, but alſo warned hys Souldiers to diſparte themſelues diuers wayes, and tould them whither hée wold haue them reſort. Some hath vſed to preuēt the worſt to begin the fight, a litle before nyght, to the ende that if they were ouerthrowne they might yet through the darkeneſſe of the night the better eſcape away.
               Though many other matters myght heare haue bin expreſſed, yet I omit them, and will ſomething ſhew thée how carefully the diſcipline of war hath bin continued, and how preciſe the antiquitie hath bin in puniſhing thoſe that hath broken their preſcribed orders, or hath procéeded anye farther then they haue bin limitted.
               
                  Papirius Curſor being dictator,Exāples of diſciplyne. required that Fabius Rutilius Mayſter of the Horſemen ſhould be beaten with rods & beheaded, bicauſe he fought againſt his commaūdement, notwtſtanding he had ye vpper

hand neither would hée forgeue the puniſhment for the contencion or interceſſion and requeſt of the Souldiers, and fleeing to Rome purſued him, neyther would he ther remit the dreadfull puniſhment, vntil that Fabius and his father fell downe on theyr knées, and that alſo the Senate and people made interceſſion for him.
               
                  Manlius cauſed his ſonne which againſt his commaundement had incountred with his enemy that chalenged him though hée got the victory to be beaten with rods, and haue his head ſtriken of.
               The Romaynes puniſhed with death him that lacked in the watch, he that forſooke the place that was geuen him to fight, he that caryed anye thing hidde out of the Campe, if any man ſhould ſay he had done ſome worthy thing in fighte and had not done it, if any for feare, had caſt away his weapon, and when it happened that a Legion had committed the like faute becauſe they would not put all to death, yet theyr names were taken and put to gither in a bag, and ſo by lot they drew out the tenth perſon, and put thoſe to death.
               When Marcus Cato after a token geuen,

had looſed from the Coaſt of his enemyes wher he had layne a certayne ſpace, & ſawe one of his Souldiers left on the Shore, crying, calling, and beckning to be taken in, he caſt about with al his Nauy to the ſhore agayne, and commaunded the ſame Souldier to be taken and ſtraight put to death, willing rather to make him an example to the other, then that he ſhould be ſlayne by his enemyes, with reproch and infamy.
               
                  Aliſander of Lacedemonia corrected a certayne man,A neceſſary example for Engliſh Souldiers becauſe hée ſtrayed from his company, and when the man ſayde hée ſtrayed not from the Army to rob or ſteale any thing, he aunſwered, I will that thou ſhewe no likelihode of robbery. A very good leſſon to be learned, aſwell of Engliſh Captaynes, as alſo of Engliſh Souldiers, but inſpeciallye of theſe newe leuied bandes which are no ſooner twoo miles from home, but fall preſently to robbing, ſpoyling, and euell intreating their own Countrey men, to ſhamefull to be ſuffered, and to much to be borne withall, whether this that I ſay be true or no, I ſtande to the report of ſuch as hath dwelte in theyr way, where they haue had occaſion to trauaile▪ but the greateſt

faulte of thys, is to bee imputed to the Captayne, who hath ſo litle care that he wil ſuffer it, or ſo ſimple gouernment that hée will not amend it, but ſuch Captaynes are méete to gouerne ſuch Souldiers, when Haniball ſhould paſſe a long iourney by land, he cauſed his Souldiers Swordes to be ſealed vp in their Scabardes, to the end the
                     •
                   ſhould vſe no diſorder by the way. The Army which was led by M. Scaurus was of ſuch abſtinence that it is left in memory,An example worthy to be remembred. how the Appell Trée which was incloſed at the foote of the Campe, in the morning when the Hoaſt remoued, was lefte ſtanding without touching of the fruit.
               
                  What diligence ſhould be vſed whē Captains march through vnknown places.There reſteth now to ſhewe thée, what diligence Captaynes ſhould vſe when they haue occaſion to march through vnknowne places, wherin with out great foreſight, he is in more perill then when he is in fight, wherfore Alexander vſed to haue ſuch places diſcribed in mapes which ſhould be hanged in the Campe for all men to beholde, wherby they might learne to know the places, the diſtaunces, the wayes, the Hilles, the Riuers, the Fennes, and all the qualities of them, but inſpecially wher the countrey

is wooddy or hilly, Captaines ought to beware of ambuſhes, which being not foreſéene may quickly ouerthrow them.
               Ambuſhes haue many tymes bin diſcouered by the rayſing of great duſt, or when Doues or other Byrdds hath bin ſéene to ſlye about in flocks turning to and fro, and hath not ſéemed to light, in theſe reſpectes there ought to bee wyſe ſcowtes to ſée and vewe the Countrey cleare.
               And as they may enter into theſe daungers by marching vnawares, ſo may they lykewyſe by craft of the enemy be trained into thē, as were ye 
                  Fideniens by Romulus, who laying a parte of his Army in ſecret, ambuſhment approched vnto them, from whome hee fayning him ſelfe to flye, brought them haſtely agayn purſuyng him where his Ambuſhmentes lay, who aſſayling them on euery ſyde eaſly ſlewe them. They ought therefore to take héede and not ſtrayght way to beleue thoſe things which are nothing reaſonable, and that they are not as they import. Some to intrap their enimyes hath ſet before them a pray, if many of the one ſide be driuen away by a few of ye other, or if a few on ye one ſide aſſaught

many of the other, or if ſome ſodayne flight ſhould be made, not ſtanding with reaſon, let them in theſe cauſes take héed and iudge the worſt, ſo ſhal they be ſure to be the leſſe beguiled.
               
                  By what meanes many hath paſſed Riuers or ſtrayghts.To paſſe Ryuers or ſtraightes, there hath bene diuers means vſed, ſome to paſſe Ryuers haue cut out a Trench like a rainbowe, filling it full of Wood, and ſetting it on fyre, by theſe meanes haue paſſed.
               This policy was vſed by Q. Sextorius in Spayne, likewiſe by Pelopidas a Thebian, againſt the Theſſalonians.
               
               When Creſſus might not wade ouer the Riuer Halis, neither yet could make Boat nor Bridge, he caſt a ditche behynd his Army, and ſo turned the courſe an other way.
               
                  Caeſer being in Fraunce and hauing to paſſe a Ryuer, and his paſſage being letted by the enemy on the other ſide, who were ſtill ready to receiue him, marched many dayes along the Ryuer, and the like did the enemy, wherefore Caeſer incamping in a wooddy place fit to hyde men, he tooke out of euery Legion iii. Cowardes and made thē to tarye in the ſame place, commaunding them that ſo ſoone as he was deperted they

ſhould caſt ouer a bridge and fortify it, and he with his other men kept on his way, but when he ſuppoſed the Bridge was redy, he returned paſſing the Ryuer without anye great let.
               When Pericles of Athens, being driuen by them of Peloponeſus into a place inuironed with ſtepe Hils, where was but twoo wayes to eſcape out, before the one way where hée entended to get out, hée cauſed a ditch to be caſt of great breadeth, vnder pretence to ſhut out his enemyes, and to the other ſyde he led his Hoaſt, as thogh he wold ther haue broken forth, wherefore his enemyes beleuing he might in no wiſe eſcape yt way where he him ſelf had caſt ye ditche, withſtood him with all their power, on ye other ſyde, thē did Pericles caſt Bridges prepared for the nonce, ouer the ditche, & that way conuaid out his Army, wher ther was no man to let him. Whē 
                  Spartacus was incloſed by L. Varinus Proconſul, he pitched vp ſtakes here and there, before the entring of his Campe, and ſet theron dead carkaſes clad & Harniſed lyke men, to make a ſhow vnto them that were farre of, that watch and ward, was diligently kepte, leauyng

alſo fyers in euery quarter of the Campe, vnder the which deceiptful colour he deceiued his enimyes, and conuayed away hys Hoaſt by night.
               
                  Darius to deceyue the Scithes at his departing, left Dogs and Aſſes in his Tents, whoſe barking and braying the enemyes hearing, thought Darius to be ther ſtill.
               With the lyke errour the Genowayes blynded the Romaynes.
               
               
                  Of ſuch as hath bin inuaded.And now to ſpeak ſomething of ſuch as hath bin inuaded, ſome hath ſent their own men with their enemyes Aunſyentes to ſpoyle and burne their owne Countrey, whereby the enemy beleuing them to bée ſome of their owne company, or ſome that wer come in their ayd, running forth with out reſpect, hath bin therby made a pray.
               By this meanes Alexander hauing a company of Epirotes agaynſt them the Illiriens, ſent forth certayne of his men in the Illiriens apparell giuing them commaundement to waſt and deſtroy his own countrey, Epirus the which when the Illiriens eſpied, they now careleſſe began to run forth on euery ſyde to pillage, and thus they wer intiſed & brought into daungerouſe places

where many of them were ſlayne, and the reſt put to flight.
               Some haue ſuffered the enemy to take many Townes, to the intent that by putting in the ſame Gariſons he might by that meanes deminiſh his power and be made weake, and then by aſſaughting them they haue ouercome them.
               Wher Souldiers hath bin found to be fugitiue or to run to the enemy,Where Souldiers hath bin fugityue▪
                   I think ther may be no better meane then that vſed by Haniball, who knowing certayne of his mē to be fled ye night before, & wiſt well that ye enemyes ſpyes were in his Campe, he pronounced openly that thoſe runagates were gon by his commaundement to harken and ſpye what his enemyes pretended, this being known to ye 
                  Romanes ſpies, returned & told theſe newes to their company, whervpon theſe runawaies wer taken and their hands cut of, and thus they wer ſent agayn to Haniball. When Hanno Captayne of Carthage in Cicilia vnderſtood that Gaulls which hée had hyred about 4000. would leaue hym and go to the Romaynes: bycauſe they were behynde vnpayde for certayne monethes wages, and durſt not

puniſh them for feare of ſedicion, but promiſed very liberally to recompence the iniury they had by prolonging ye tyme, which ſomething appeaſed them, and at conuenient he ſent his moſt truſty Steward to Otacilius conſull, fayning as though hée had fled away for a controuerſy betwéene hys Captayn and him, in a certayn compt making, and ſhewed him the nexte night hée might take at aduantage 4000. Galleys which ſhould be ſent to get pray & pillage, Otacilius neyther geuing credit by and by to the runaway, neyther yet thought it a matter to be deſpiſed, layd an ambuſhment for thē of the moſt piked men that he had, which incountring with the Galleyes, ſatiſfied the drift of Hanno double, they ſlew many of the Romaines, & were themſelues all ſlayne.
               
                  What circumſpection ſhuld be vſed for fear of ſpyes.Noble Captaynes hath vſed great circumſpection in their affayres, for being preuented with ſpyes, wherefore aboue all thinges it behoueth him to be ſecret.
               One demaunded of Metellus pius, being in Spayne, what he was minded to doo the day folowing, who aunſwered, if I wiſt the ſhirt on my back did know it, I wold ſurely

burne it.
               When one aſked Lucinius Craſſus what tyme he would remoue his Army, he aunſwered, art thou aferd thou ſhalt not know that by the Drum.
               But foraſmuch as in al this time, ther hath yet bin nothing ſayd appertayning to thée beſieged: I will therefore ſhew thée ſomething what reſpects they ought to haue, and ſo will end.
               To ſhew thée what prouiſion of victuall,Vhat regard ſhould be obſerued by the beſieged. Artilery, ſhot Powder, and ſuch other firnitures they ought to be prouided of, were but in vayne here to make reherſall, conſidering they be thinges that euery man vnderſtandeth, and is requiſit to be prouided before the ſiege doth come.
               I thinke it ſhould as litle neede to aduertiſe them to beware of treaſons, for thoſe examples are likewiſe as generall.
               But this ought to be had in regard amō
                  geſt them, that the enemy take no comodity of their cattel, victual, hey, ſtrawe, or any other prouiſion in the Coūtrey neare about them, for theſe thinges ought rather to bée deſtroied, thē to be left as prouiſions wherwithall to ſerue the enemy
               
                  The beſieged ought to haue a ſpeciall care to haue good watch to be kept, yea euen in thoſe places wher they thinke they may take leaſt hurt, for many Towns haue bin loſt when the enemy hath aſſaulted it, on that part which the beſieged hath thought to be inuincible.
               By this policy Fabius Maximus wan the Citye Arpos, by the ſame meanes Marius in ye war againſt Iugurth obtained a caſtel.
               Let them lykewyſe take héede for being drawne out of the Towne by any deuyſe, as if the enemy fayneth to flye, or to make ſome other ſtaall, for by theſe means many hath bin deceiued.
               
                  Haniball by theſe meanes obtayned the Citie Hymera Himilco of Carthage, at Agrigentum layd priuily in wayte neare to the Town, part of his Army, and commaū
                  ded that when the Townes men wer iſſued out a good way of, they ſhould ſet gréen
                     •
                   wood on fyre, and in the morning very early with the other part of his Army he wen
                     •
                   to intiſe out his enemyes, and making a
                     •
                   though he fled reculing backe, drewe the
                     •
                   a good way from the Citye, then they tha
                     •
                   lay in ambuſhment neare the wals as the
                     •
                  
                  
wer commaunded, ſet the greene Wood on fyre, the Agrigentiues beholding the ſmother, ryſe vp, ſuppoſed verily their City had bin on a fyre, thus fearfully running back to defend it, they wer incountered by thoſe that had layne in ambuſhment, and thus betwéene them and the other which purſued they wer diſcomfited and ſlayne.
               The beſieged are ſometymes beguyled by ſignifying vnto them ſome victory gotten, as did Pelopidas of Thebes, who purſuing to conquer twoo Townes at one inſtant of the Magnecians and which ſtood not far a ſunder, he cōmaunded that foure Knightes ſhuld come from the one ſiege to the other, with Garlands on their heades, as though they brought tydings of victory, and to help forth this diſſimulation he ordayned that a Wood which ſtood betweene both the Townes ſhould be ſet on fyre to make a ſhow as though the Towne had burnt, beſides that he cauſed certayne men to be brought as priſoners in Townes mens apparell, by which aſſuraunce hee ſo amaſed the beſieged, that they thinking them ſelues halfe ouercome, yelded vp.
               
                  There be many other practices wherwith the beſieged hath bene beguiled,Many deuiſes wher by the beſeged hath ben deceiued. ſome tyme when it hath bin knowne to the enemy, that there ſhould come ayde to aſſiſt them, haue therfore appareled their Souldiers vnder the aunſients of thoſe yt ſhould come, and thus haue deceiued them.
               Sometyme by taking of thoſe that haue gone aforaging ſending others in their apparaile: Sometime by ſending Souldiers vnder the colour of market men, dryuing beaſtes laden with traſhe.
               Sometime by turning from them their water, or elſe by poyſoning of the ſame, as did Cliſthenes of Cicion, the water that ſerued the towne of Criſeans.
               
               Sometyme when a Captayn hath found a Citie to be ſtrong haue therefore conquered rounde about it, all the Townes and Caſteles of purpoſe, to ſend in aboundaūce of people to the ſame Citie which they deſired, and by theſe meanes haue ſpent their victuals, when famiſhment hath cauſed them to yeld.
               Sometyme when Townes haue bin well repleniſhed with men, which beyng knowne to the enemy that came to beſiege

it, haue turned to other places, and by theſe meanes haue brought abought, that the townes men on truſt that their chiefe citie was ſtrong enough, haue emptyed themſelues to defend others, wherby it hath ben made eaſy to be won.
               
                  Fabius Maximus, waſting and deſtroying ye countrey of Campania, to the ende he would leaue his enemies as bare as might be, he departed from them in the ſéede time to the entent they might ſow the reſidue of theyr Corne, and when it was ſprong vp, he returned and trod it to naught, and thus by famyn got them to yelde.
               Thus I haue briefly ſhewed thée ſuch ſleyghtes as hath béen vſed by the nobleſt Captaynes, the knowledge wherof would not a little noriſh the imaginations of ſuch as ſhould peruſe them, ther reſteth now to ſhew thée certayn general rules, which are no leſſe worthy to be noted, then profitable to be folowed, and thus they begin.
               That whatſoeuer is profitable to thée,Certaine generall rules. is hurtfull to thy enemie, and that which helpeth him, hindereth thée.
               He that in war moſt laboureth and exerciſeth his Souldiers in warlike trauails

ſhall alway ſuſtayne leſt perill, and ſoneſt hope of victory.
               Thoſe counſailes are beſt which the enemy knoweth nothing of, tyll they be executed.
               Occaſion or ſodaine hope in battail helpeth more, then vertue or ſtrength.
               To know in war how to take occaſion, helpeth more then any other thing.
               Neuer conduct Souldiers to fight the fielde, tyll theyr myndes be ſetled.
               The greateſt part of prudent Captains rather receue the vyolence of the enemye, then to go wyth vyolence to aſſaught.
               It is hard to ouercome him that can truely iudge his owne ſtrength, and what power his enemy is of.
               A fewe men well practiſed, more auayleth, then great numbers vnperfect.
               The well choſen place doth ſometyme more auayle, then valiaunce or ſtrength.
               He that with diſorder followeth his enemy vnwiſely, may of a cōquerour, become ſometimes a loſer.
               He which is vnprouided of neceſſary victuall, is ouercome with out weapon.
               He that aſſeyeth more in his horſemen

then in his footemen, or in his footemen more then in his horſemen, muſt choſe his ground ther after.
               If thou thinkeſt thy coūſayl to be known to thy enemyes, it ſtandeth thée in hande to chaunge thy pretence.
               Conſult with many what thou oughteſt to doe, but what thou myndeſt to execute, kéepe ſecret to thy ſelfe.
               Good Captaynes neuer fight the fielde, except they be driuen vnto it by ſodayne hap, or great néede.
               The greateſt pollicie is to greue thy enemie rather with hūger then with weapon.
               It is neceſſary that Captaynes be well furniſhed with thrée kyndes of truſty people, that is to ſay, ſpyes, ſcowtes, & guides, ther truſty ſeruice bringeth good aſſurance to an Army, the lacke of them is great hinderaunce to inuaſion.
               Learne what may preuent thy enemie and profit thy ſelfe.
               Captaines ought rather to ſay with pity this I can doe, then with tyranny this I will do.
               To vſe victory gently is more famous, then to conquer cruelly.
               
                  The hardy courage, lyberall heart, and good perſwaſion, maketh a Souldier more profitable to the battaile in the day of fight, then the coward Captaine foliſh and vnthankfull, with multitudes of treaſure.
               Though many other matters might here haue béen expreſſed, yet thus much at this inſtāt, touching captaines ſhal ſuffice.
            
            
               Soul.
               The goodnes of thy godhed doth ſo graciouſly abound, that it maketh me perſeuer in demaunding, being not afrayde to be reputed preſumptious, and bicauſe it hath pleaſed thée of thy owne beneuolence, thus throughly to inſtruct me in the knowledge of martiall feates, and the ſeruice in the warres on the lande, yet foraſmuch as the knowledge of the ſeruice at the Sea hath euer lykewiſe bene accompted a moſt honorable ſeruice, but in ſpecially with vs in England, conſidering the greateſt parte of our defence, doth ſomething conſiſt in the knowledge of the ſame, that it would therfore pleaſe thée to informe me likewiſe in ſome thing appertayning to that noble ſeruice, and of what gouernment Captaines ſhould be, that ought to take ſuch charge in hand.
            
            
               
               Mer.
               Touching the noble ſeruice at the Sea, it were much better for me to be ſylent rather then in ſpeaking, that I ſhould ſeme to ſpeake to lyttle, the which of neceſſitie I ſhuld be conſtrayned, or elſe to ſpeke to ſmall effect, conſidering that neyther by woord ther may be expreſſed, neyther with pen ther may be preſcrybed any certayne derection that might gretly profit the ſkilleſt man, for the knowledge of that ſeruice is not to be attayned,Seruice at the Sea not to learned but by ſeruing on the Sea. but onely by ſeruing on the ſea, and it behoueth ſuch as ſhold be Captaynes, or to take charge that way, to haue ſome ſkil in Maryners Arte, ye which at the ſhore is not to be come by.
            
            
               Soul.
               And yet I haue known ſome which I am wel aſſewred, cam neuer at the Sea, that hath bene able to diſcourſe of Nauigation in a more perfect maner, then a great number of thoſe that be accōpted for ſkilfull Maiſters.
            
            
               Mer.
               And yet thoſe perfect talkers ſhould be founde as ignorant to execute their own preſcriptions, if they wer brought vnto the Sea, as thou ſheweſt thy ſelfe to be deceyued in my meaning, to aunſwer me thus in a cleane contrary matter, for it forceth

not ſo much in a man of war to haue knowledge in the Art of Nauigation, as to be well experimented in many other cauſes, but bicauſe the variacion of thy aunſwere falleth out ſo fit, to talke of Maiſters ſkill, I wil ſhew thée therfore how the Maiſters ſhould be choſen, whereby thou maieſt the better perceiue the meaning of my former words. Fyrſt thou muſt vnderſtand ther are, as they be termed, two ſorts of Maryners, in whom ther is likewiſe found, two ſundry ſkylls, that is, Art in the one, experience in the other, then firſt to ſpeak of the artificiall Nauigator, who beſt deſerueth the greateſt commendation, be ſuch as vſe to trauail to far and vnknowne countries, who ſayleth altogether by the vſe of his inſtruments, who knoweth by the eleuacyon of the Pooles, by the Altitude of the ſunne, the place wher they neuer came in before, with many other things, which to the vnlearned, might ſéeme very ſtraunge, and the perfect manner of this Arte is in déede to be learned by him, that neuer came at the Sea, yet not to be executed but by him that hath experience withall.
               
                  The ſecond ſort be thoſe that be commonlye called Coaſters, and bée ſuche as hath little ſkill in the vſe of Inſtruments, but their helpe is onlye by knowyng of the Land where they happen to fall, or elſe ſometyme by ſounding of the Depth, or by knowing what ground they haue vnder thē in the place wher they ſound, & ſuch other lyke, as experyence hath taughte them, ſo that where there is occaſion of ſeruice at the Sea, ther muſt reſpect be had to the place when the ſeruice ſhould be done, and thereafter to make the choice of the Maiſter.
               But foraſmuch as Engliſh men are not greately troubled with Warres, on the Sea, but only vpon theyr own Coaſts, the laſt ſorte of Maryners are therefore thought moſte requiſite to bée appoynted for Mayſters, the reaſon is, bycauſe England is inuironed with Holand, Sealand, and Fraunce, on the one ſyde, and with Ireland on the other ſyde, and the diſtaunce of the Chanyell is ſo narowe betwéene Land and Land, that it is a great chaunce that a Shippe being betwéene eyther of theſe places, ſhould not once

within xxiiii. houres fall, eyther with the one, or with the other, and then the perfect coaſter that can ryghtly deſerne to make & know the lande, is for many occaſions the méeteſt man to ſerue in theſe afayres: and bicauſe the Maiſters charge is eſpecially to kéepe the Ship in good ſecuritie when ſtormes and tempeſtes happen to fall, conſidering ther is here no Sea rome to try it out, but muſt ſéeke ſome place to herbour themſelues, as wynde & weather will geue them leaue, I haue therfore briefly ſhewed how to make choyce of ſuch a one as might be moſt fyt to aunſwer the purpoſe.
               But now to returne to our former talke, conſidering that the manner of the fighte ſhould altogether be ordred by the captain, therfore, as I ſaide before, it is néedeful for him to haue ſome ſkill in Mariners Arte, elſe ſhall he neuer be able to iudge what he ought to do.
            
            
               Soul.
               I would thinke ther ſhould be no great policie in Sea fight, but when they méete, he that hath the greateſt number of Shyppes, and the beſt apoynted, by common reaſon, were lyke to haue the victorie.
            
            
               
               Mer.
               Nay not ſo, for ther is yet an other helper, which as it paſſeth the common reaſon of ſuch as want experience, ſo it preſerueth him that can attayne it, from any great daunger of his enemies, were they neuer ſo many, and that is, to haue the aduantage of the wynde.
            
            
               Soul.
               But then where the greater force hath bereft the other of that aduauntage, and thereby haue gotten himſelfe double benefite, is there no other help then but to yeld?
            
            
               Mer.
               Thou muſt vnderſtand, the order of Sea fight is this, when enemies méete, the ſtronger wil ſeeke to aſſayle the weaker, the weaker then for his better ſecuritie ſéeketh as much as he maye, if he can not get from him with a ſayl, to get the winde, which if he may obtayne, the greateſt fear is paſt, but if he be preuented, he muſt then determine to defende himſelfe by blowes, which with wiſe gouernment, he may wel do, for although the hauing of mo Ships, or the greater company of men, is in déede a great aduauntage, ſo their daunger is a great deal more when they ſhall be driuen to aſſaught, & the other but to defend, for as

great pollicie, and as much aduauntage may be vſed in the defence of a Shippe, as in the defence of a Caſtell, where one thouſand men with good dyſcreſion, may repulſe ten thouſand, that ſhould aſſaught them.
               To ſhew thée any farther of their orders of 
                     •
                  ight, it would fall out to as ſmall effect as this which I haue alredy tould thée, and therefore I would wiſh thoſe that are deſirous to haue knowledge in that ſeruice, to ſéeke it at the Sea, wher it is to be had, and otherwyſe to be come by, to any perfection.
            
            
               Soul.
               Although thus ignorantly I follow ſtyll in my order of demaunding, and ſéeing thy godhead ſo liberally to offer that which I ſhould haue bene aſhamed to haue aſked, it geueth me therfore the greater encouragement, in ſpecially when it procedeth rather of a deſire that I haue to be ſatiſfied my ſelfe, then of any obſtinacy or any other wilfull contencion, and bicauſe I do now call to my remembraunce ſome part of our former diſcourſe, wherein thou ſéemeſt to miſlike in our choyce of Engliſh Souldiers, as far as I can perceiue by other of thy inſtructions, ther ought greater

regarde to be had, in appoynting of the Captayne, then in the choyce of the pryuate Souldier, conſidering that it onely reſteth in his dilygence, to trayne and make hys Souldiers perfect and redy at ſuch time as néede ſhall require.
            
            
               Mer.
               what reſpecte ſhould be had in the chooſing of a Souldier, I wyll a lyttle ouer paſſe, and wyll fyrſt ſhewe thée how Souldiers be choſen in Englande when occaſion doth ſerue, which commonly falleth out in this manner.
               The Prince, or Counſayll,The maner of choſing Souldiers in England. ſendeth downe theyr warrant, to certayne Commiſſioners, of euerye ſuch Shyer where they mynde too haue ſuche a number of Souldyers to bée leuyed and appoynted, the Commiſſioner he ſendeth hys precept to the hye Conſtable of euery Hundred, the hye Conſtable of euerye Hundred, he geueth knowledge to euerye petye Conſtable of euerye Parryſh within his cyrquet, that vppon ſuch a daye, he muſt bring two or thrée able and ſuffycient men, to ſerue ye Prince, before ſuch Cōmiſſioners, to ſuch a place, the pety Conſtable when

he perceyueth that wars are in hand, foreſéeing the toyles, the infinite perilles, and troubleſome trauayles that is incident to Souldyers, is loth that anye honeſt man through his procurement, ſhuld hazard him ſelfe amongſt ſo many daungers, wherfore if within his office, there hap to remayne any idle felow, ſome dronkerd, or ſediciouſe quariler, a priuye picker, or ſuche a one as hath ſome ſkill in ſtealing of a Gooſe, theſe ſhall bée preſented to the ſeruyce of the Prince, and what ſeruyce is to bée loked for amongeſt ſuch fellowes, I thinke may eaſily be déemed, and I will ſomethinge ſhewe.
               Fyrſt by the way as they trauayle through the Countrey,Their vſage as they trauail thorough the countrey. where they chaunce to lye all nyght, the goodwyfe hath ſpedde well if ſhée fynde hyr ſhéetes in the morning, or if this happe to fayle yet a couerlet, or Curtins from the bed, or a Carpet from the table, ſome table clothes, or table Napkins, or ſome other thing muſt néedes packe away with them, there comes nothing amiſſe if it will ſerue to by drinke.
               And lykewiſe as they go by the waye, wo be to that Pyge, Goſe, Capon, Hen,

Shéepe, or Lambe, that fortunes to come in their walke.
               Then in the ende,The beſt ſeruice that is to be loked for amōgſt them. when they come in the place of ſeruice, where generally there are no ſuche looſe endes in common to be founde, bicauſe they muſt haue ſomething to kéepe them ſelues in vre, then his felowes ſhyrtes, his ſword, his dager, his Caliuer, his Moryon, or ſome other parte of his furniture, muſt ſuffice the turne.
               Whether this that I haue ſayd be trew or nay, I ſtande to the report of ſuch as hath hadde the leadinge of newe leuyed bandes.
               Thus through the ſimplicitie of a Cunſtable, the Princes ſeruice is abuſed, the maners and diſcipline of the aunſient orders corrupted, and the name and eſtimation of the noble Souldier vtterly deſpyſed.
               What farther inconuenience myght come of this appoyntment,Note this well. I thinke thoſe that be wyſe may very well foreſée, when ſuch euell condicioned people, in whome there remayneth neyther Religion, neyther obedience, neyther fidelitie, or good meaning, neyther any other one ſparke of

vertue, who being in place wher ſo many good lawes are preſcribed, and may not yet be reſtrayned from their vile and filthye condicions, & yet ſhall nowe be put in truſt to defende the Princes quarraile, wherein doth conſiſt the onely ſecuritie of thoſe that were the ſetters of them forth, if they had reaſon to conſider of it.

               I will not ſéeme to contende, but ſuch order of apoyntment there may bée, and ſuch Souldiers peraduenture maye be founde in theſe new leuied bands, but this I dare boldly affirme, that ſuch Souldiers as hath ben trained, or that knoweth what to ſeruice doth pertayne, or any other in whome good ſeruice might be found, would as greatly deſpiſe to be detected of any ſuch infamy, as any other that doth counterfait the greateſt ciuilitie.
            
            
               Mer.
               
                  How Souldiers ought to be choſen.Then to procéede how Souldiers ought to be choſen, the firſt and greateſt reſpecte that ſhould be had, is to haue regarde to his manners and condiciōs, otherwiſe ther might be choſen an inſtrument of miſchife, and a beginner of diſorder, then conſideration muſt be had of his ſufficiency, which is to be coniectured by the

yeares, by the compoſition of his members, by the grace of his countenaunce, by the luſtines of his body, and by the quicknes of his ſpiright, which may be ſuppoſed by the liuelineſſe of the eyes.
               And bicauſe ſuch hath euer bene thought moſt expediēt to ſerue for ſouldiers, which might beſt indure all maner of trauailes, & ſuch as hathe not bene accuſtomed to any great eaſe, the which condicions, as many do ſuppoſe, is moſt common to be founde in the huſband man, or labouring man, and although this ſuppoſition is not to be denaied, yet I do not allow of their choice, that wold choſe huſbādmen to ſerue for ſoldiers
               Fyrſt, bicauſe the labouring man may in no wiſe indure to be pinched of his victuall, I meane to be brought to ſome ſhort alowance, as thoſe that vſe or frequent the wars, may ſometime be brought ſcarſly to make on good dinner in a weeke, ſomtimes in a moneth, ſometime in more, as occaſion doth fal out: although I know, therbe many ye wil think me to be much deceued, & wold aūſwer, ye huſbandmen might beſt away wt this ſcarſitie, conſidering ye they be brought vp to hard & ſimple fare, which although it

be trew, yet proofe hath ſhewed the contrary, wher any ſuch hath bene apoynted, and experience hath taught ſuch as haue marked it, that where any ſuch want hath hapned, thoſe kynd of people haue firſt ſhewed themſelues to bée worſt able to indure it.
               And in warres it goeth not ſo much by him that can fare hardly, as by hym that can longeſt continewe with leaſt meate.
               For to fare hardly, ther is no man how dayntely ſo euer he hath bene brought vp, but hunger wyll teach him to away with a courſer dyet.
               But he is to be alowed for a Souldier, that if occaſion doth ſerue, can be wel contented to ſatiſfie himſelfe with ſome ſmall petaunce, or that may endure with ſome little quantitie, whoſe courage wyll nothing diſmay, if they may haue but wherwith to ſuffice Nature, and this abſtinēce proceedeth onely of the valewer of the mynde, and is not to be founde in the huſbād man, or labouring man, who although they may away with ſimple fare, yet they muſt haue their bellies fyld, they can not abide to be pinched of their victual, for if thei be brought but to ſome ſmall reſtraint in

compariſon what noble Souldiers will indure they preſentlye ſhewe themſelues to haue no manner of courage but euen as men that were more then halfe dead in whom there is to be found neither hope nor comforte.
               An other cauſe why I would refuſe ſuche for Souldiers is this, becauſe the order of ſeruice in theſe daies conſiſteth much in the quickneſſe, nimbleneſſe and redineſſe in Souldiers and this celerytie is not to be found in Huſbandmen, or laboryng men.
               Furthermore they are vtterly voyde of one of the greateſt graces that to a Souldier doth pertayne.
               Which is to be delightſome in the wearing of his apparell and in the keeping of his furniture: for lyke as there was yet neuer any excelent Artificer whiche hath not had a ſpeciall regard in the keepyng of ſuch Inſtrumentes as apertayneth to his facultie in a neat and decent manner, ſo queſtionleſſe he he wyll neuer proue to be good Souldier, that hath not delight in the keping of his furniture, wherewith he is apoynted to ſerue in a braue and galant order.
               And in my opinion one of the greateſt reſpectes

that maye be vſed in the choyce of a Souldier in whome there hath bin had no maner of triall, is to haue conſideration in his order of apparell, for he that taketh not ſome felycitie in the wearynge of his garments in good order and faſhion, wil neuer take any pleaſure in the keepynge of his furniture, and to be ſhort wyll neuer proue to be a good Souldier, for what vnſéemlyer ſighte may there be when a Souldier ſhall come into the Féelde with his Armour all ruſtye, the ioyntes vnriueted, the Leather and Buckels all broken and tyed together with poynts, his Sworde halfe without a ſcabard, his Pyke head vnuayled, and ſewtable to the reſte, his Caliuer ſo verniſht with ruſt, that the Cocke wyll not play, and then his game wyll not goe, as they tearme it, his Morryan with one cheeck off, and an other one, or els hanginge a ſwaſhe lyke a Hogge new hunted, and although that euery band hath of ordinary Armorers, and other that be appoynted for the mendyng of any the premeſſes, yet the piniſhneſſe is ſuch, or rather the ſlouthfullneſſe of a many of lubbers ſo great, that they cannot vouchſafe to cary them where they might haue

ſuche fautes amended withoute any other trouble.
               Wherfore, I woulde not wiſhe that any ſuch kynde of people ſhould be permited to ſerue for ſouldiers, for what greater incouragment may there be to the enemy, then when he ſhall incounter with ſuch a one as both by his apparell and the reſte of his furniture doth ſhew himſelfe to be but of ſome baſe minde, or of ſome other ſimple condytion, and noble Captaines hath euer ſought al meanes and occaſions to diſcorage their enemies, and not to incorage them. Wherfore the Romaynes were accuſtomed to garniſhe their ſouldiers with Feathers, to the ende the ſhewe of their Armye might ſeeme the more teryble to their enemyes.
               Lykewiſe the firſt inuention of the wearynge of Scarfes in the warres, was vſed as well for terrifinge the enemye with the brauery of the ſhow, as alſo for neceſſaryes verye meete and readye to bynde vp a wounde when they ſhoulde not come by clothes at a ſouddayne where with to ſerue the tyme.
               
                  Thus much touching the choyſe of Souldiers at this preſent ſhall ſuffice, yet not forgetting to geue them theſe few precepts. Which is principally and aboue all things to be obedient to their Captaine, to practiſe the vſe of ſuch weapons wherewith they be appoynted to ſerue, to be ſecret, to be ſilent and to be couragious.
               And now beholde where ye court of Venus doth ſhew it ſelfe to be but euen, heere at hand, and therefore there is better time to end our talke, then when we ſhall ende our iourney.
            
            
               Soul.
               But if without preſumption I might but demaund this laſte queſtion wherein I greatly deſire to be ſatiſfied, and this it is, whether the Calyuer, or the long Bowe as we tearme them heare in Englande, be of greateſt force I haue harde this queſtion diuers times to be argewed on & ſome that haue bin ſuppoſed to haue had good experience haue preferred the Caliuer to be of greater force in ſeruice then the bow which I think few wiſemen wyll beleeue, and our enemies can witneſſe to the contrary that from time to time haue felte our Archers force, and how many noble victoryes haue

bin by them achiued, Cronicles are ful, and Hiſtories can well make mencion, and I am of that mind that one thouſand good Archers would wronge two thowſande ſhot, yea and would driue them out of the Feeld and there be a great many of that opinion beſide my ſelfe.
               What hath bin don in time paſte maketh nothing to the purpoſe for the time preſent for the order of the warres is altogether altered, and in an other manner then they haue bin in time paſt, but now to anſwer to thy demaund and breefly to ſatyſfye thy deſire, thou muſt firſt conſider to what perfection ſhot is lately growne vnto ouer it hath bin within theſe few yeares, when paraduenture if there were one that ſarued with a Halfehaake or a Hagbus as they termed them which were peeces to ſmall efect, vnleſſe it were euen hard at hand, ther is now ten for that one, which ſerueth with the Caliuer or Muſquet which, peeces ar of a new inuenſion and to an other effect. So lykewiſe they haue a better compoſition for the makynge of their powlder and the Souldier is grown by practiſe to a greater celerity in the vſing of his peece then in time paſte

he hath byn of. Thus the effecte of the one by practiſe is increaſed, and the force of the other by nature is deminiſhed, for ye ſtrēgth of men is generally decaied, whereby they are not able to draw ſo ſtroung a bow, nor to ſhoote ſo ſtronge a ſhotte as in the olde tyme men haue bin accuſtomed.
               But to the ende thou mayeſt the better perceaue wherein the aduantage or diſaduantage doth growe. I wyl vſe this compariſon (wherby) I doubt not but thy owne reaſon ſhall perſwade thée.
               Suppoſe one thouſande Archers ſhoulde be leuyed within any two Shiers in Englande let them vſe no further regard in the choice then of ordinary they ar accuſtomed: In the ſeruice of the Prince, let theſe Archers be apoynted with ſuch liuery Bowes as the Country generally vſeth to alow, let theſe Archers continnewe in the feelde but the ſpace of one wéeke, abidynge ſuch fortune of weather, with their Bowes and Arrowes, as in the mene time might happen. I would but demaunde how many of thoſe thowſand men were able at the weeks end to ſhoote aboue x. ſcore. I dare vndertake that if one hundred of thoſe thouſande doo

ſhoote aboue ten ſcore, that .ii. hundred of the reſt, wyll ſhoote ſhorte of .ix. ſcore, and is not this a peece of aduantage thinkeſt thou? when euery Calyuer that is brought into the Feelde wyl carry a ſhot xviii. ſcore and, xx. ſcore, and euery Muſquet .xxiiii, and xxx. ſcore.
               Beſides this euery Buſhe, euery Hedge, euery Ditch, euery Tree, and almoſt euery Moalhil is a ſufficient ſafgarde for a ſhotte, where the Archer is little worſe, but on a playne, when the ſhotte wyll conuay them ſelues into euery couerte, that the Archer ſhall not ſee whereat to ſhoote, and yet hee himſelfe remayne a fayre marke for the other, or els can vſe no ſeruice.
               Now whether part hath the aduantage, I thinke may well be deemed, and whether weapon is of greateſt force, a man maye eaſ
                     •
                  ye perceaue, when the ſhotte ſhall be able to preiudice the Archer, who ſhal not be able to ſhoote halfe the grounde towardes him agayne. Farther when the Shotte ſhal take aduantage almoſt in eueri ground to ſhrowd himſelfe, where the Archer muſt remaine an open mark vppon the plaine or els to occupy his Bow to ſmal efect.
               
                  But let it be that one thowſand Archers and one thowſande ſhot ſhould meete in the playne Feelde where no vantage were to be taken by the ground, & admit they were ioyned in ſkirmiſh, within .viii. or .ix. ſcore where the Archer is able to ſhutte twice to the others once, wherby the Arrowes comming ſo thick amongſt them, wil ſo aſtone them that the contrarye part ſhall not well know where at to ſhoote.
            
            
               Mer.
               But thoſe that frame this argument hath little practiſe in the vſe of the Calyuer, and leſſe experience in the order of a ſkyrmiſhe for if a thowſand Archers were brought into the Feelde I truſt all woulde not be brought to ſhootte at one inſtant for yf they were, ſome of them would ſhoote to ſmall a vayle, as he that hath experience can well ſay.
               And yet if there were no other aduantage to be vſed in ſkirmſhe, but who can ſhoote faſteſt he that is a ready ſhotte I dare ſay, would be loth that an Archer ſhould ſhoots aboue, viii. times to his .v.
               And this aduantage in often ſhootyng is not ſo great in the one but the difference is much more in ye other, conſiderīg their force

for where the one doth but gaulde the other doth either mayne or kyll.
               But to ſhew thée what farther aduantage the ſhot hath of the Archer thou ſhalt vnderſtand that where the Archer may ſhoot both wide ſhort and gone, the other may ſhoott but wyde onely. But becauſe thou mayſt the better perceayue my meanynge thou muſt conſider that when the Archer ſhooteth any diſtance of grounde, the Arrowe commeth compaſſe of a great height, ſo that when it commeth where it ſhould indanger, which is, with in the compaſſe of mans height it falleth preſētly to ye ground and hath but as it were one lightyng place and paraduenture may come directly ouer one mans head and fall right at an other mans feet which ſtandeth but .iii, yeardes behind, where if it had falne but one foote ſhorter, it had indaungered the firſte ſo yf it had gone but one or two foo
                     •
                  e farther it had hazarded the laſt.
               Thus as I haue ſaide the Archer though he ſhoote right yet he may ſhoote both ouer and vnder, where the other can ſhoote but wide onely, conſidering that the ſhot is ſtyll

carried away within the compaſſe of mans height, whiche aduantage to ſuch as hath reaſon to decerne it arighte ſhall perceyue, that one ſhotte from the Muſquet or Calyuer, is of greater poſſibilytie to indaunger then fiue that ſhall come from the beſte Archer that is brought into the Feelde.
            
            
               Soul.
               I vnderſtande the meanynge verye well, and doo nowe perceaue the Calyuer indeede to be of greateſt force, and yet I had a great deale rather beleeue it my ſelfe, then to vndertake to make a great many of others to beleeue it.
               But nowe I perceaue we may hange our Bowes vppon the walles for I can not perceaue how they wyll nowe ſtande vs in any great ſteede to ſerue in warres.
            
            
               Mer.
               Nay not ſo neyther, was it any part of my pretence ſo abſolutlye to obiecte the Archer nor yet to make hym of ſo ſmall effect, but that his ſeruice is to be commended, and not to be forborne, for ſo it mighte as well be ſayde what ſhould Horſemen do in the Feelde where the enemye hath picks to defende them againſt whom they coulde

yet neuer preuayle: yet no man doubteth but Horſemen are ſeruiſable for manye cauſes, although it be not to run againſt the Picks, ſo likewiſe Archers maye do verye good ſeruice, althoughe it be not to incounter with ſhotte.
               But my wordes tended to this ende that I woulde not haue thee to be ignoraunt in the vſe of ſo principall a weapon, but rather woulde wyſh it might be practiſed, conſidering it aſketh tyme, or many may haue the readye vſe of it, for lyke as it is a ſpecyall Weapon to hym that can vſe it in good order, ſo it is as defuſed, and vntowarde to hym that hath not the practiſe of it, and ſhal ſooner indaunger hymſelfe, or his Friende that ſtandes nexte vnto hym, then hurte his Enemye. Therefore I woulde wyſhe that thoſe which ſhould vſe this Weapon, to be very expert and wary in the vſe and orderyng of the ſame.
               And now behoulde, we haue at lengthe approched to our deſyred place, loe heere the Courte of Venus, where for a tyme I wyll leaue thee to finiſh thy pretence.
            
            
               And as I was deuiſing with my ſelfe, what reuerence I might vſe to the God for his great curteyſies, hée was ſodainly vaniſhed from my ſight, I wyſt not where, and it was no tyme for me then to ſtande vppon my newe determinacions, but prepared my ſelfe to this ſumptuous Court. To the which when I was approched nere, my maſed minde was fullye fraught with greate admiration, not ſo muche to ſée the rarietye of the worke, and the ſtraungeneſſe of the buylding, as to ſée ſuch ſundrye ſhewes of diuerſe ſtoanes of pryce, of variable hewe, the whiche in euerye wall was there 
                  •
               o curiouſlye couched, as it ſurely paſſed any arte of hand▪
            
            There was dyrectlye ouer the entrye of the gate, twoo fearefull examples of Iuſtice vſed vpon twoo obſtinate perſons which had béene rebelles to the Lawes of Venus.
            
            The one was that ſcornefull ymphe Narciſſus, whoſe bewtye enamoured the heart of euery Dame that dyd behold him, and whoſe pryde diſdayned that any at all ſhoulde ſo muche as touch him, for which contempt hée him ſelfe was as iuſtlye deluded,

as before he was accuſtomed to delude, and mocke with others, for lyke as his bewtye had inflamed the harts of many a Ladye, which had behelde it, euen ſo it was ordained by the prouidence of the Gods, that in beholding the Image of his owne face in a cleare well, his owne bewtye, which before had bewitched ſo many hath nowe ſo beguiled him ſelfe, that hée there miſerably conſumed with loue with his owne ſhadowe.
            The other ſhewed how the Lady Anaxarete, a wylfull Dame, whoſe ſtoany heart woulde neuer rewe on Iphis cauſe, who ſeeing him ſelfe to bée bereaued of al manner of hope dyd hang him ſelfe before her gate, the Gods now ſéeing this woofull chaunce tranſeformed this Dame to a hardyned ſtoane for her vngentle facte.
            There was ouer theſe twoo ſtories, a verſe in Latine written in lettes of golde, which might bée Engliſhed thus.
            
               Loe, here the dome of Rebelles ſuch
               which earſt our lawes contemnde:
               VVhoſe paruerſe mindes, and haughtye pride,
               are iuſtly thus condemnde.
            
            And when I was come into the baſe

Courte, I gaue my ſpecyall regarde to the maners of ſuch as paſſed by me to and fro, whoſe geſtures as they were diuers, ſo ther orders of apparell and maner of aray was as contrary & varyall, for who had throughly marked them, might partlye haue deſerned the effects of loue by their orders & conuerſation.
            Ther were ſome that were arrayed all in greene,Snters at Venus Courte or lyke delightſome coulors, by whoſe luſtye cheare, they ſeemed to be ſuch as had the world at wyll, wantyng no part of their deſyers.
            There were other lykewiſe appareled in blew, vſynge a more demuer countenance there were ſome that were appareld all in yellowe, by whoſe franticke conuerſation there mighte be deemed ſome ſuſpytiouſe minde, there were other in ruſſet, vſing a very modeſt cheare, ſome in tawny, whoſe doleful lookes bewrayed ſome ſecret greefe
            There were ſome that were arayed all in black walkyng by them ſelues in ſolytary ſorte, wringing of their hands, beatynge of their breaſtes, yeeldynge many piteous ſighes, who had behelde them, might well haue deemed a liuely patterne of a deſperat

mynde. And when I was come into the vpper Court, the beauty thereof, was not ſo far excéeding, but the Muſick which I hard in euery corner, was as ſwéete and delctable: from thence I paſſed into a ſumptious Hall which was richly hanged with clothe of Arres work, wherein was wonderfully wrought many a famous Hiſtory, tending all to the aduancemente of the Goddes Venus, and of Cupid her ſonne, ſhewinge how it hath cauſed the ſtronge and myghty to become feeble and weake, the Cowarde and daſtarde, to be valyant and hardye, the wylde and ſauage to be humble and meek, the fierceſte and furyous to be gentyll and lowly, the wiſe and learned to be foolyſhe and fond: and not onely men that hath bin thus tranſformed, but euen the Goddes them ſelues, hath become ſubiecte & thral, and conſtrained to obey to Venus and her lawes.
            In the vppermoſte parte, the Goddes Venus was firſte deſcribed, ſittynge in her Waggon, wherin ſhe is drawne by her too Doues, there was ſtanding by her a baſket heaped with harts: which was moſt pitifullye conſumed in Flames of ſcorchyne

fire, ſauing that the Goddes hauing Water ſtanding by, would nowe and then delaye the rage and furious heate: In the fore parte of the Wagon ſtoade the blind boye Cupid, wounding with his arrowes the hearts which houered in the ayre, in ſecure and careleſſe ſort. Then there was lykewiſe ſhewed howe the mighty Ioue, when hée went to vewe the Heauens and earth, to ſée if ought had periſht through Phaetons wylfull fact, in which ſuruaye, as hée eſpied the fourme and bewtye of Parraſis, a Nimphe of Dianas troupe, with whome hée as carefullye ſought to accompliſhe his deſyre, as before hée had regarde to the repayring of the Heuens and the reſtoring agayne of the Earth to the former eſtate where it was decayed.
            There was alſo ſhewed the whole ſtorye how Appollo was in loue with Daphne, Mercury with Herſe, Bacchus with Guoſida, Virtunmuus with Pomena, Pan with Sirinx: And how many of them for their better ſpeede hath taken vpon them ſundry ſhapes, and tranſformed themſelues as Iuqiter to a Bul, Phebus to a cuntry clown Mercury to a Goat, Saturne to a Genit and

               Bacchus to a Grape, and not the celeſtyall Gods, that haue bin thus by loue ſubdewed alone, but alſo the Goddes of the Sea, and euen Pluto himſelfe, the God of Hell, hath not bin able to reſiſt this mighty ſtrocke of Cupids pearſing dart.
            There was alſo to be ſéene that monſtrus and ougly Giant Polipheme, whoſe wylde and ſauage kynde gaue terror to euerye thing that dyd behold hyme, and yet he was by loue ſo ſurpriſed and ouer come, that for the time he cleane forgate his wilderneſſe and mourtherous harte, and frames hymſelfe in forme of woers trade.
            There was alſo how the noble Herculus became from a mighty conquerour, to ſitte in womans attyre, at the whéele and Cardes, and ſerued Omphale Queene of Liddia, and farthermore, how both Ariſtotle and Socrates, in deſpight of their Philoſophy, the one became a ſlaue to Hermia the other a ſubiect to Aſpaſia.
            
            There were many other Hiſtorys, which all together tended that neither wyſedome learnyng, polecye, ſtrength. valyaunce, nor any other ſleighte, may once withſtande or preuayle againſt the aſaults or conflictes of

loue. There was in the vppermoſt verge of this clothe artificially wrought in great Letters, a verſe in Latten, the ſome wherof contayneth to this effect.
            
               Yf neither God ne man my ſnares,
               hath yet eſcaped free:
               VVhat wight art thou, wilt then reſiſt,
               againſt my lawes and mee.
            
            Dewring the time that I ſtood thus pervſinge of theſe deſcryptions, there weare many Gallaunte Ladyes and other beautyfull Dames, which paſſed by me to and fro, amongſt which there was one who perceyuing me to be a ſtraunger, very courteouſly ſalutynge me demanuded yf I had any ſute to prefer to the Goddes Venus, wherin ſhe might pleaſure me, for that ſhe was accuſtomed as ſhe ſayd to prefer ech louers cauſe, and to aſſiſt them in their ſutes.
            To whom when I had geuen moſt humble thankes, I courteouſly intreated her to ſhew me her name, which as ſhe ſayd was good countenaunce, whom euery louinge wight hath in great veneration.
            When I perceiued Fortune ſo fauorably to aſſiſt me, I thought it had binne but mere ſimplicytie for me to forſake the Ladies

fryndly offer. Wherfore in breefe diſcourſe, I ſhewed her the whole cauſe of my comming thither, which as ſhe vnderſtoode takynge me by the hande, ſhe led me vp a payre of ſtayers, and broughte me into a merueylous large and beautifull chamber whiche was repleniſhed with luſty Gent. and mani other braue and gallaunt dames and as they were diſpearſed in many companyes, ſo they were vſing as many amorus exerciſſes, ſome were recityng of tales, and tellyng louinge Hiſtoryes, ſome were ſingyng to the Lute and Virginalles, many amorous Ballades, ſome were in the Pauyans and Galliardes, and happye was he that before his Ladye coulde do the luſtieſt tricke, with many other like paſtimes.
            The which when I behelde, I began to imagine in my ſelfe, and in my mind to ſay O bleſſed and happy wights, how fortunate are your dayes, in what pleaſure and delight ſpend you your bleſſed time in reſpect of ſouldiers, whoſe hard tearmes and miſerable conditions, are far otherwiſe alotted, when they muſt march in ye Féeld after the ſtroks of dredful droms, you may dance vppon the riſſes after the ſteps & ſounds of Inruments, when ſouldiers be in the féeld dealynge

of bloudye blowes, you may be your Ladies chambers delyng of amorus kiſſes, ſweet imbracyngs, and louinge countenances, when Souldiers muſte be content to take their lodgings in the wylde feelds: and open ayre, and yet not aſſuered to lye all night in quiet, you may be in your warme and ſoft feather Bedes, imbracing your delights, abidyng no vnreſt vnleſſe it be to ſatiſfye your owne amorous deſires, when Souldiers muſte be rowſed to geue ſome earlye aſſaulte you may kéepe your Beds, vnleſſe you ſome times, ariſe to geue your Parramours the hunte is vp, vnder the windowes, moſt happye therefore (I ſay) is your eſtates, and as I continued in theſe cogitacyons, commendynge in my minde both loue and louers trade.
            There was one that as it were in the nick began to tell a ſtraunge and tragicall Hiſtory, the which I gaue good heed which tale when he had finiſhed, I was throughly reſolued to how manye miſchifes vayne men commit them ſelues, whoſe loue is ſo inordinat, that nether bite nor bridle is able to reſtraine the furye thereof, and for as much as I haue vſed this tedious longe diſcourſe

of warres and marciall cauſes, I think it not amiſſe to recreate your weryed myndes with this ſo ſtraunge a Hiſtorye, whereby you ſhall perceiue whether this groſe affection, vayne hope, and blynd loue, may carry men vnto, and of what force the Arrowes of blind Cupid be, and what frute they bringe to them that practiſe the ſame how it not onely paſſionatly their mindes with moſt outragiouſe, and intolerable afflictions, but alſo ſo farre ouerwhelmeth them that they many times, throwe them ſelues head longe into the gulfe of mortall deſtruction, and into the depth of ſhame and infamy as this hiſtory more euedently appeareth which in this wiſe enſueth.
            IN Prouince a Countrye which all men know, no whit inferior to any in all Europe, whether it be for the ſituation thereof as being repleniſhed with rych and fayre townes, or for the fertyllytie and pleaſantneſſe of the ſoyle, or the courteſye and ciuillytie of the people inhabityng or dwellyng in the ſame.
            There is a little towne or village not

farre from Nice whiche they call Lagraſſe, ſituated in a fayre long playne & in ſo pleaſante a place, as any man may with eie behold in that plaine to the merueilous ornamentes and deckynges of the buildyng, the goodly graſſe groweth ſo thicke and greene that were it not for the continuall graſinge of the cattell in the ſame, it would alwaies appeare a contynuall ſpringe time, beſides throughout this graſſye and flowery playne you maye beholde the goodlye Lemons, Orange and Pomegarnet Trees charged and laden with their frutes, deckynge the country ſo rychlye in ſuch goodly order that it ſéemeth onely nature hath traueled to the adournyng thereof, and beſides theſe all other kynde of frutes doth ſo inoble and adorne this teretory or place, that it ſemeth to reſemble the famous wood of Theſalien remembered or ſpoken of by Heredotus Plinius, Strabo, Elias & in his third booke of Hyſtorys diuers, and not forgotten of the the Poets whiche place is frequented, and aſſayled of the paſſers by, eſpeciallye of the Inhabytantes, whiche bidde (as it were battell) to the Trées and fru

            But be it, whether the hipocriſie ſo long hyd in the wicked hart of this Ladye, could not any lenger couer the wickedneſſe therof, without ſhewing ſome profe of the fruts of the ſame, or whether that the greneneſſe of her Huſbands yeares, being now for age come into a ſcortchy dryneſſe, and withoute moyſture, had loſt his ſtrength, or (poſſible)

led by the naturall appetite of ſuch as loue to change, beinge now vppon the poynte of their age, of a younge vertuous and chaſte Lady, ſhe was now become an olde harlot, and being tender, and in the yeares of her youth gaue vnto all a more hope, (that is to ſay) ſhewed more effect of her honeſty, then hir age did in ye mortifica

            This Ladye now comminge to yeares and Children, began to muſe of loue, and to deſire of her Huſband that which could not be twice had, and that whiche ſhe her ſelfe had not ſo much deſired when thoſe flames are moſte excéedinge in the gréennes of her yeres, ſhe not contenting her ſelf now with the froſen and rare imbracementes of her Huſbande, ſhe beganne to excogitate the meanes to ſatiſfie her vnbrideled deſyers, and by that meanes beganne the miſchife which after cauſed the ruine of her ſelf, and

the perpetuall diſhonour of all hers.
            Theſe are, as you may ſee, the effect of this wrecthed beaſt, carnall pleaſure to bring to man the plague or peſtilence, vnder the vizor of a cleare & holſome ayre, and to plong and drown the ſéely ſhip when the ſaylours ſhal think themſelues moſt in queit harbor Who wil not confeſſe heere that loue is as it weare a certayne rage, madneſſe or fury, ſéeing that ſhe doth cauſe to doo violentlye, that whiche ought to refraine and bridle thoſe immodeſties, & foolyſh paſſions, that ſhe doth ſuggerate or put into our mindes. Now there was dwelling in this Lagraſſe, a certaine Docter of the lawes, an aduocate and a Citiſen of the ſayd towne.
            This Docter, for that he was of counſell with the Lords of Chabry, in proces of time had ſo good credit both of the Lorde and Lady that oftentimes he entred into the chamber of the Lady, her Lord being abſent, and woulde there conſult with her in her Bed, wherof the Lorde was nothing ſuſpicious, but it came that on a daye, (during the abſence of the Lorde of Chabry) this Doctour came to viſyte and ſée this Madame, lying yet in her Bedde, where hée bent him ſelfe

to behold & contemplate more liuely the bewty of the Lady, whſoe liuely colloure her Age had nothing altered: And with an intent farre otherwyſe then hée was wont to ouerſee the profeſſe the Lord of Chabry: Shée which ſawe the Doctour youthfullye diſpoſed: And as ſufficientlye able to furniſhe the affayres appertayning to the bed, as of matters in the Lawe whiche touched the houſe, was nothing ſorye to ſée this Goate to beholde her ſo vnſhamefaſtly, but more bolde than any common harlot, made no conſcience to diſcouer that part of her bodye, the which honeſtlye any ſhamefaſt woman coulde not, nor ought to diſcouer, And that with countenaunce and eyes ſo Laſciuious & vndiſcret, that he that were leaſt practiſed in the affayres of loue, might eaſelye haue knowne and perceyued, what prouendour the Horſe nayghed for, Iudge then if this Lawyer ſufficiently practiſed in ſuch deceyptes, knew or perceyued that, ſhe moſt deſyred, or if hee forgat to commend the bewty or proportion of the well ſhape in members of this vnſhamefaſte Alcine: Which in ſmyling wyſe ſpake vnto him: Alas Mayſter Tolonio (for ſo was hée called,)

Is it not, vnto me, great dammage? That my Lorde is ſo diſcrepite and olde, that I can not nowe any more enioye that thing, that it may content my pleaſure and appetite, being my ſelfe in ſuche diſpoſition as you ſée? truelye this good man careth for no more but to mumble his Prayers and ſmall Suffrages, in the euening tyll he bée as coulde as Iſe, which doeth whollye coole in mée the heate of my firſt deſyres: And if at any tyme I doe aduaunce my ſelfe, to ſtyrre vp in him, or to awake the forces of the fleſhe, alas it is no purpoſe, ſo that (wyll I or nyll I) I muſt bée fayne to kyſſe (as it were the Shéete) with ſo great diſpleaſure, as I ſhoulde haue of contentment, If I had a man worthy of mée, which could accompliſhe this appointment, whiche is due in Marriage.
            The Doctour hearing this, right eaſelye vnderſtood vnto what ende ſhée had diſcourſed this fayre Tale: Aunſwered, Madam, I ſuppoſe your Ladyſhip hath euer prooued and knowne mée for the Loyall and faithful ſeruitour of your houſe: Neuertheleſſe, I beléeue (vnder correction) that my Lorde is not ſo farre ſpent, that his age ſhould let

him to geue yet ſome contentacion, to any Gentlewoman, how yong or luſtye ſo euer ſhee were.
            The diſhoneſt Ladye hearing him ſaye ſo, aunſwered: Tolonio, men iudge commonly of thinges at randome, as they haue taken roote in theyr cogitacions, through their owne onely opinions, but thoſe which haue knowne the effectes, and whiche haue experimented tho contrarye, maye ſpeake without reproche, and according to the truth of that which others hold not, but by thought onelye, you eſtéeme my Lord ſo valliaunt a Champion: that (by your wordes) there is no armour which he is not able to péerce, But I which doe féele, his weakeneſſe, cowardiſe, and ſmall force, maye ſpeake thereof more certainelye and aſſuredly, to my great gréefe, to the ende, that you taking compaſſion of my ſorrowfulneſſe, maye ſeeke the meanes to ſuccour mée, and to delyuer me from this greéfe of ſickneſſe, that I doe endure: Madame ſayde hée, thinke not, that for the encreaſe of your anoy, I haue ſpoken ſo boldlye, for I wyll rather choſe death, the moſt ſhamefull and ignomious, that anye man coulde imagyne or

thinke, then to haue geuen to your Lady ſhippe, the leaſt occaſion of ſorrowe: And I woulde to God, Madame that my trauaile or dylligence, might ſerue for an eaſe, or abatement of your Ladyſhiyps trouble, you ſhoulde then right well perceyue that Tolonio is not of the number of thoſe, whiche promyſing much and performing lytle, but I geue you to vnderſtande, (if it pleaſe your Ladyſhippe to vſe mee) that of al thoſe of your houſholde, there is none more readye to obeye, or do ſeruice vnto your Ladyſhippe, bée it that therein I ſhould offer or ſacryfice myne honour, or lyfe, yea, and I ſhall thinke my ſelfe happy to employe and ſpende eyther the one or the other, in the ſeruyce of ſo famous and high a Ladye: And ſaying ſo? ſeeing him ſelfe aloane in her Chamber, tooke the hande of the Lady and kyſſed it, with great affection: The Ladye ſéeing the matter ſort to that effect, euen as ſhée had before excogitate, or thought in her fantaſye to execute, preſſing hard the hande of this Gentleman, ſpake vnto him verye curteouſlye: My Lorde Tolonio, if fortune were to you ſo fauourable, and rendered mee ſo muche yours, that you ſhoulde

thinke or beléeue to haue parte of my good grace and fauour, what thing woulde you enterpryſe or attempt to inioye: and pleaſe her which ſo lyberallye, and without any other reſpect, eyther of lyfe, or honour, would leaue vnto you her heart in gage, and her bodye to diſpoſe at your pleaſure.
            A Madame, ſayde the Doctour, the feare that I haue, that ſo greate goodneſſe ſhall not chaunce or come vnto mée, (although I doe earneſtlye deſyre the ſame,) maketh my heart to faynt: And on the other ſyde, the pleaſures of my conceptions lyfteth mée vp ſo high, that there is nothing ſo difficult or harde, that I would not wyllinglye take in hande to attayne the ſame: Pardon mée Madame I beſéeche you, if I haue béene bolde ſo lyberally to diſcouer vnto you, that whiche I thought to kéepe ſecréete in myne owne heart? And blame and accuſe your ſelfe, that hauing power ouer mée, haue made mee to ſaye more then I had determined to manifeſt, vanquiſhed of a paſſion ſo extreame.
            And ſay you ſo ſaid this diſhoneſt lady? truly that was the very ſcoope or poynt wherevnto I did moſt aſpire, and ſince it is ſo, that I

maye Aſſure my ſelfe of youre fidelitie and faythfull loue, I praye you alſo to truſt and beleeue aſſuredly,The infamous Docter, and courſed Ladye haue agreed together. that I am and wilbée holy at youre commaundement, and that which I haue promiſed in worde you ſhall ſée it come to paſſe by the effectes, the playes and paſtymes accompliſhed both of the one and the other partie, the two deteſtable adulterers made theyr matche to geue them thenceforth to paſſe the tyme as pleſauntly as coulde be thought: Euenſo this diſloyall varlett obeyed the vnbrideled pleaſure of this vnſhamfaſt woman heaping ſinne vpon ſonne, for beſide the abhominable ſyn of defyling Another mannes bedde, he committed felony and treaſon againſte him which put aſſured truſt in him,He committed Felonye and Treſon. and at the wages of whome he did ordinarilye liue. Here may we ſée what the mallice and wretchedneſſe of thoſe is, which vnder the cloak of good letters & learning and couloured (naye rather ſtuffed) with a certayne vayne knowledge to deſcerne and Iudge Iuſtice from iniuſtice, make profeſſion to ouerthrowe all Iuſtice, to peruert all order of honeſty, and to deceiue vnder the title of good fayth, the conſciences of the moſt ſimple.
            
               Thus oure vnhappy worlde (or rather) the mallice of this our curſed tyme hath made to budde and ſpring of men that are learned, Deuells, which vomiting a certain falſe Philoſophy haue infected the ayre with their corruption, and not contenting them ſelues to abuſe the fleſhe, and to bring the life of man vnder the Adulterouſe Infamy of beaſtly, carnall and filthy pleaſure, haue (as it were giauntes) addreſſed them ſelus to battayle againſt the heauens.
            So truelye the houſhoulde Seruaunt euell effectes towardes his Lorde and mayſter is more to be feared, then a thouſand enemies Running and wandering abroade as ths Lorde of Chabry experimented by the meanes of this mayſter Lawyer the which abuſyng the Lady and ſhe her Lord & huſband, both of them (I ſay) to the ende the more at their eaſe to continewe their inſolent whoredom and abhominable lyfe, made their matche together, to murder him, and euen as they had deuiſed ſo they brought it to effect.

And leſſe it was that any had the leaſt ſuſpition, that the Lady his wife, or hir Proctor Tolonio had deuiſed that treaſon,

and cauſed this poore Innocent to be murthered. But this miſchieuous woman after the knewe of the death of hir Huſbande,She fayneth deſperation. halfe in diſpayre (for ſuche ſhe faygned hir ſelfe to be) caſt hir ſelfe vppon the mangled and bléeding carkaſſe of hir Huſbande, maynely crying out, not ſparing to teare hir apparell, and the heares of hir head, watring ye face of the deceaſſed with faynt feares, began to fayne a voyce apt to expreſſe the inwarde dolour of a paſſioned ſpirite,Ah vvicked vvoman. in ſaying: Ah▪ miſfortunate Gentleman, is it come to paſſe that thy fate and deſtinie ſhould conduct thée to this miſfortune? and that in the time of theſe thy latter yeres, in the middeſt of thy friends, and in thine owne houſe, to haue béene murthered ſo trayterouſly? Ah that I my ſelfe had not beene partaker of thys thy great miſfortune, that I might haue been companion in graue with him, the loue of whom ſhall neuer departe, out of my ſoule: Ah cruell Murtherer (who ſoeuer thou arte) what floudes of teares thou ſhalte make to be diſtilled, and how much bloude wilte thou make to be effuſed to appeaſe and pacifie the ghoſt of my good Lorde

and huſband? I beſeech the Gods that thou mayſt neuer be able (théefe and traytour what ſoeuer thou be) to eſcape the handes of him, which hauing ſworde in hande ſhall auenge me that am thus miſerably afflicted by thy onely meanes. Ah my friende, ſayde ſhe (imbracing the body all diſcheuered of hir dead huſbande) how ſhoulde this traytour knowe thée, whiche hath thée ſo vilanouſly outraged and ſlayne. Alas poore children, what a father haue you loſt, and I poore widdowe deſolate, the ſuſtentation of myne honour, and the ſupport of all my familie? In this meane time the Doctor, hauing made ſute after the murtherers of his good Lorde, and returning from the purſute of them which lodged in his owne houſe, was very ioyous to ſée this Lady ſo well to play hir parte in this Tragedie, of the which ſhe hir ſelf was the very firſt author, approching vnto hir, hauing ye teares in his eyes, ſayd vnto hir: Wel Madame, ſayde he, wyll you nowe (as they ſay) caſt the Hatchet after the Helme. My Lorde is deade, and thinke you to rayſe him vp agayne by your vehement lamentations and cryes? Take pacience, I pray you, in

that aduerſitie that it hath pleaſed God to ſende vs, and imploy and aſſay your ſelfe to take vengeance vpon thoſe whiche you ſhall find to be culpable of the death of your Huſbande. In the meane time take order that his Corpes may be entombed as apperteyneth to a Lord ſuch as he hath bin in his life time, which thing was foorthwith executed, for they buried him very honorably, with the lamentations and teares of all his ſubiects, in the chappell of the Caſtle, and in the ſepulcher of his Predeceſſours: Alſo the poore Subiects ſore lamented their Lady, ſéeing the incomparable ſorrowe and mourning ſhe made for ſo ſoden loſſe of hir Lorde. And they all ſuppoſed that willingly ſhe would haue made a ſepulchre of hir owne body to haue buryed hir huſbande, if it had bin lawfull for hir to haue cauſed him to be burned to haue drunke his aſhes, as ſometime Artemiſia did of ye burned Relikes of hir deare Manſole.
               Manſole. O feminine cautel, & crafty hoore, who is ſo ſapient & wiſe that can be able to kéepe him ſelfe from beeing deceyued with thy craftie and fraudulent deceipts: Alas there is no malice, deceipt, treaſon, miſchiefe, or

crueltie, that is comparable to the treaſon, miſchéefe, or diueliſhneſſe of a woman that hath once forgotten the vertue & good grace that oftentimes doth accompanie the feminine Sexe. What greater argument of ſutteltie and craft would you in this womā than to ſée hir deſperately to deplore that whiche inwardly maketh hir ſpirites to leape for ioy, at which inſtant hir eyes are conſtrayned to poure out riuers of teares, and hir toung to tell foorth abundance of lamentable words: After the buriall of the Lorde of Chabry, for that ſhe woulde not be thought to haue faygned the great amitie that ſhe had always pretended to beare towardes hir Lorde, cauſed to make diligent information agaynſt thoſe that had perpetrated and committed this haynous murther: but the Commiſſaries and witneſſes were thoſe them ſelues whiche had imbrued their gyltie hands in the bloud of the poore Innocent.The Doc

and for the inioying whereof he had made ſo prodigious an enlargement of his conſcience, the whiche was ſuche as dyd prepare the way to all miſchéefes, yet more great & deteſtable (if poſſibly it might be) than the euils & faults before committed.

hir wordes: Alas, ſayde ſhe, what is he nowe that ſhall take vppon him the defence of the honour of this deſolate wyddowe,Marke hir ſtraunge inuentions and perſuaſions. ſéeing hir owne children are the firſt that bring hir honeſtie in doubte and queſtion? where ſhall we finde fayth, loyaltie, good opinion and aſſurance, if the proper bloude deſcended from our Entrayles, doth ſo conſpire agaynſt our ſelues. O miſerable is the condition and ſtate of our Sexe, that when we thinke to haue certayne and ſure reſt, euen at that tyme fortune dothe ſorte and allot to vs hir priuie watches and ambuſhes, to turne vs from the eaſe that we before pretended. O my ſonne, my ſonne, are you of the number of thoſe which iudge ſo raſhely and at randon? Make you ſo little accompte of the reputation and conſtancie of Ladies of honour? Meaſure you their chaſtitie with the fooliſhe reprehenſions whiche flowe out of the braynes of vayne talkers and euill ſpeakers? Alas, it is not onely at this day, but euer hath been accuſtomed that vertue is on euery ſide beſieged with ſlaunder, enuie, and falſe impoſition of crymes: it is not I alone that endure theſe bitter and almoſte inſupportable

iniuries and falſe accuſations, whiche nowe féele my ſelfe falſly ſlaundered of that villanie whereof I neuer thought. They are not the Ladyes of my Chabry, which ſuffer them ſelues to be ſo tranſported vnto the fonde appetites of the fleſhe, neyther is it from hencefoorth tyme that I ſhoulde thinke of theſe follies, vnto the whiche I neuer gaue my ſelfe in my young yeeres▪ Are you offended to ſée Tolonio ſpeake to me in ſecret? Do you thinke it euyll that he entreth familiarly into my chamber? Know you not that it is he only which knoweth al the affaires of the houſe, and did execute the ſame in the lyfe time of your late Father my L. and huſbande? Ah wretched and infortunate woman that I am, to ſée my ſelfe ſo ſuſpected, who neuer thought nor aſpired to any other thing thā to ye encreſe of your welth: and Tolonio more infortunate to trauell & take payne for the loue of you, which promiſe none other thing vnto him for his rewarde than preſent deathe: No, no my ſonne, Tolonio is a very honeſt Gentleman, and hath béene euer ſo taken and accompted of, onely ſpeake vnto hym of it,

and you ſhal ſee if that at your ſimple commaundement he do not forſake the houſe without returning, at any time hereafter to anger you, and then ſhall you know that our affections are farre otherwiſe then you thinke, and that the fauour I ſhewe hym, is rather for your profit & aduauncement, than for the pleaſure that you falſly ſuſpect in me, which being your mother, ought rather to be worthely commended of diligēce then to be accuſed wrongfully of incontynency. The yong gentleman hearing the excuſes of his mother, and ſeeing hir ſo beblubbered with teares, and attached with dolor,

Pardon me Madame for my boldneſſe, with proteſtation that from hencefoorth I ſhal be more wiſe and ſage to ſpeake, and better aduiſed to ſuſpect the thing that may turne to ſuch conſequence. She appeaſed hir ſelfe, at the leaſte ſhee feigned hir ſelfe contented, attending till opportunitie might ſerue, yt ſhe might execute vpon hir ſon, the tragedy alredie begon vpon the father, for ſhe did not truſt the wordes of the ſymple and vertuous young man, thynking him of fayth to be as ſlippery as ſhe her ſelfe was, for ſuch is the cuſtome of the wicked, to balance & way the life of others by their own wicked

déedes. This newe Progue, or rather Tigreſſe, altogither ſet vpon the ſhedding of Innocent bloud, infected with moſt wretched crueltie, which had altered the ſwéetneſſe of hir good nature into a rage moſte deſperate, for the loue of hir Doctor, determined to diſpatche the worlde of hir ſonne (whatſoeuer ſhould come of it) to the ende ſhe might liue more at hir eaſe, & without any that ſhoulde controll hir lyfe▪ Nowe within the ſayde caſtle of Chabry, there was a highe Galarie,A rare inuē

                  her hir ſon. betwéene two lodgings, the planks wherof were very euill ioyned, and the timber halfe rotten, wherevpon this young Gentleman for his pleaſure ordinarily was acouſtomed to walke, aſwell for the pleaſantneſſe of the ayre, as for the fayre proſpect it had into the fields, but eſpecially into a moſt pleaſant Garden, repleniſhed with all ſortes of hearbes and frutes that man coulde deuiſe to imagyne, whiche was the cauſe that the Pageant whiche before ſhee had premeditate, was the ſooner broughte to effect. Thys deteſtable mother then, one euenyng cauſed the knaue hir Doctor to vnnayle two or thrée bordes of the ſame Galarie, and

to diſioyne them from the ioyſtes wherevppon they were layd, that he that ſhould treade vppon them ſhoulde fall downe headlong vppon the rockes in the dytches that laye vnderneathe. As it fortuned to thys young Gentleman no leſſe vnhappie in an vngracious mother, than his Father had beene in a wycked wife, for the daye after that thys trap was thus prepared he fayled not to come into the Galarie, where hauing made two or thrée turnes, ſette hys foote vppon the ende of the diſioynted boordes, and ſodaynely fell downe vpon the Rocke: ſo was he moſte miſchieuouſlye brayned, and hys members all to bruzed and broken with the fall, dying before he almoſte felte the apprehention of death.Oh curſed fact. Who woulde euer haue once thought that the Mother had beene ſo follonious, cruell, and vnmercifull, as to ſée (by hir owne vile and wicked meanes hir owne ſonne bruſed, mutilated, and deformed, ſeeing that this name and tytle of mother is ſo ſweete, and amarous, that the hearts of the moſte ſtubborne are thereby mitigated or mollified, and we ſee that euery one holdeth their owne ſo

deare and in ſuche price, that the very beaſtes them ſelues, pricked by nature (although incapable of reaſon) haue ſuche affection towards their yong ones, that they feare not to▪ oppoſe them ſelues to all perils, to conſerue and defende them: Alſo the greateſt comfort or good that man may haue, beeing in the continuall waues of the Sea of this troubleſome worlde, is to ſée him ſelfe as it were regenerate and borne anewe in his children, and in the propagation and increace of his ſeede: and yet this ſhee diuell and madde furie of hell, hauing alreadie loſt the affection that the ſpouſe or wife ought vnto hir huſbande, put alſo in obliuion the natural loue ſhe ought to haue borne to the frute of hir body engendred.
            After the fall of this yong Gentleman, you ſhould haue heard nothing within the houſe but lamentations and cryings, one crying his Brother, another bewayling his Couſin, another lamenting the ſodayne and vnlooked for death of his Maſter: but all this was nothing in reſpecte to that which this deteſtable Murdreſſe dyd, for ſhe tormented hir ſelfe ſo deſperately, and of ſuche ſort, that you would haue thought

all the worlde ſhould haue ſunke, ſhe faigned hir ſelfe to be ſo excéeding ſorowful. So this ſame Megera, vnder a huge heape of dolours ſhe couered the extreme ioy of hir heart, and vnder the ſhewe of a certayne exteriour ſorrow, nouriſhed the venemous hony which lay hidde in hir ſtomacke. The obſequies of this yong Gentleman were celebrated ſomewhat pompeouſly, and his body was buried by his father, to the ende he might participate both in tome and miſfortune, him whiche had begot him. The Lady ſeeing hir ſelfe diſcharged of a great hartebreaking, not hauing any more hir Sonne in hir companie, to ſuruey or mark
                  •
                hir dealings, began nowe more familiarly and boldly to intertayne and imbrace hir Doctor, not fearing ſo muche as ſhe dyd in the life of hir eldeſt ſonne. But the ſeconde ſonne, not knowing any thing of the occaſion of the death of his brother: and where before he had not taken any great regarde of the fonde gouernment of his Mother, began nowe to ſuſpect hir, and declared the ſame ſo wel in countenaunce, that he could not ſpeake one onely worde to Tolonio, but ſuche as contented him not, and ſuche

as made to appeare the euill will that he bare to this infamous knaue: and if perchance he ſpake at any time to his mother, he did it with ſuche diſdayne, that he could not well beholde hir with a good eye, wherof ſhe being maruellouſly vexed & as angry as was poſſible, did deliberate and determine to bloudy wholly hir renowne, and to fill hir whole houſe with parricide & murthers intollerable, tending to that ende to celebrate the nuptiall ſong of hir wicked mariage. And ſo this vngentle harlot conſpired agaynſt hir ſeconde ſonne, & ſo ſware his death as ſhe had done the other, with the miniſter of hir abhominable wickedneſſe Tolonio, which tooke vpon him the charge, and promiſed to bring to effect, that which ſhe before ſo earneſtly deſired. This worthy Lawier brought vp in the ſchole of Pluto, and rather learned in his lawes, than in the lawes of Emperours and Pretorierum Edicts or ordinances of the Senate, addreſſed him to a wicked companion of his, that before had murthered the Lord of Chabry, the whiche he very eaſily corrupted, for an euil heart and a miſchéeuous nature can not but ſhewe the frutes of

their corruption and malice. This knaue hauing receiued a certayne ſum of money of this Doctor, aſſured him to make him a good accompt of that he hoped for: and he fayled not of this promiſe, for certen dayes after, they béeing on hunting, as the moſte part of ye ſeruants were folowing the chaſe of the Hare, the poore young man reſting him ſelfe vpon a high rocke, from the which the going downe was very perillous, for the headlong ſteepeneſſe thereof vpon the one ſide. This murtherer whiche all the whole day had not ceaſſed to ride and followe by trace to finde occaſion to performe his enterprice, very glad to ſee that he had founde ſo good oportunitie, came behinde him, and thruſt him downe from the toppe of the rocke ſo forſibly, that thys poore Gentleman was depriued of this mortall lyfe, before he coulde perceyue who it was that had aduaunced him ſelfe ſo outragiouſly to finiſhe and ende his dayes. Neuertheleſſe (thys curſed Hagge of Hell borne to ſpoyle and tormente hir owne children, thinking to keepe ſecrete hir deteſtable and abhominable filthineſſe, and to appeare a woman of great honeſtie

before the worlde, which had made no curteſie to ſprinkle the earth with the bloud of Innocents, whiche cryed vengeance bothe agaynſt hir and agaynſt hir Varlet, whiche had béene the cauſe and mouer of all theſe murthers. After the funerals of this young man, ſéeing that all hir ſeruaunts began to ſuſpect of their priuie dealings, and doubted of their ouer muche familiaritie, ſhe communicated and conferred with hir beloued Doctor, of the ende of all their enterpriſes, that is, howe they might bring it to paſſe, that they might ioyne togither in mariage: but Tolonio (béeing alreadie married to a wife as ſage and vertuous as he was vile and miſchéeuous) deliberated to make ſome ſecrete riddaunce of hir by death, how deare ſoeuer it coſt him. Wherfore he certified his Lady and louer, who liking very well of his deuice, prayed him to haſten and diſpatche the execution therof with as muche ſpéede as he poſſible mighte. This wicked and couetous Doctor did this, not for any great or extreme loue he bare vnto hir, when he deſired ſo muche to marrie: for he knewe very well that commonly they are wont to intertene

and imbrace traytours, to ayde them with their diueliſhe and ſubtil inuentions: euen ſo Tolonio knowing that the Lady of Chabry was riche and well monied, purpoſed (his wife béeing dead) to marrie hir, to haue the ſpoyle of hir goods, and then after (peraduenture) to make hir to treade the ſame pathe, traced by ſo many murthers, committed by the meanes bothe of the one and of the other: Neuertheleſſe he did not yet knowe which way to perfourme his wycked deſire. O wicked and vnbrideled couetouſneſſe, how haſt thou depraued and bewitched the ſpirites of men at this day? Truely the father is not well aſſured of his ſonne, the neighbour dothe feare the ambuſhes and deceipts of his neighbour. And the Prince oftentimes is in daunger of his perſon, enuironed and compaſſed on euery ſide with his garde and miniſters: for the fooliſhe deſire to haue, blindeth ſo rightly the ſences of man, that he betrayeth his Lorde to enriche him ſelfe: and he to the ſame end dothe ſell his friende, another aduaunceth the death of him, for whoſe life he oughte continually to pray. And the thing is come to ſuche diſorder, that euen the ſacred or

holy thinges them ſelues, haue felte the poyſon and venime of this curſed beaſt, the whiche howe farre foorth ſhe extendeth hir forces, ſo muche dothe this worlde become more miſcheous, and men more trayterous and diſloyall. Now to returne againe to our bloudy Lawyer, whiche did nothing but as it were buylde caſtles in the ayre vpon the deliberation taken in the death of hys wife, for he held (as they ſay) the wolfe by the eares, not knowing howe to leaue him, nor yet with what aſſurance to holde him, without the danger and perill of hys perſon. Firſte he deliberated to aſſay by poyſon to ende hir daies, but that way ſeemed vnto hym verie daungerous. Then he caſte in hys mynde to make hir to bée murdered by hym whiche had before by his commaundement committed the murder on the perſon of the Sonne of the L. of Chabry, but that way lyked him not, for the chaſt dame ſeldome or neuer wente out of hir own houſe. Finally ledde by his owne fooliſhe appetyte, and lefte in the handes of the deuill, he determined to vſe none other meanes for this exployte, but

his owne proper handes. And therfore one night being in bed with his wife, wrything a table napkin with force about hir necke, ſtrangled hir, and as ſhe was vpon the ende and laſte gaſpe of hir life, the varlet, (thinking to make his matter good) made an outcrye, ſaying to thē that came in, that the rewme falling into ye throte of his wife, choked hir, and brought hir to that poynte that ſhe was paſt remedie of life, the which thing was eaſilie credited and beléeued of them that came in, and had paſſed without further queſtion or accompte to be made of it, but that the father of this miſerable deceaſſed came to this crye, the whiche the nighte before hadde ſupped wyth his daughter, leauing hir as whole and ſounde, and in as good caſe as euer ſhee had been in all hir lyfe before. Nowe the Father beholding the vyſage and throote of hys myſerable Daughter, perceyued by and by that hee hadde ended hyr dayes by violente deathe, and that the Rewme that hadde chooked hyr, was eyther the handes of hyr Huſbande or of ſome other by his appoyntment: whiche

he perceyued by the blackneſſe and ſwelling about hir face and throte. Neuertheleſſe diſſembling this anger, and couering his mourning, he purpoſed to aduenge him ſelfe in ſuch ſorte, that he would make him an example to all murtherers of their chaſt and honeſt wiues. And the better to attayn his purpoſe, he ſayde vnto Tolonio, My ſonne, I pray thée take order for the preparation of hir Obſequies and Funerals, according to the demerites of bothe our houſes, and in the meane time I will go into the Towne, minding to make quicke returne, and to ayde you in any thing that ſhall be requiſite. The Aduocate occupying him ſelfe about the pompe and preparation of the Funerals of his wife, his father in lawe halfe tranſported with dolour and griefe, went to ſéeke out ye criminall Iudge of the Towne, whome he prayed to come to ſée the moſte deteſtable facte that man could imagine to thinke, and of whiche he would haue compaſſiō, if he were not more cruell than Timon the Athenian, whiche for his fierce and cruell nature was ſurnamed the common enimie of mankind. The Magiſtrate, aſwell to be readie (as his office

required) to render to euery man iuſtice, as to ſée what newe thing that ſhoulde be, whereof he had made to him relation, followed him, accompanied with a troupe of Sargeants and neighbours to backe him, and arriued at the houſe of Tolonio, wondering out of meaſure, ſéeing the dead body in that order, and yet more maruelled, vnderſtanding the father of the deceaſſed to vſe to him theſe or ſuche like words: Syr, if this preſent ſpectacle be not ſtraunge vnto you, or if the teares of a ſorrowfull father looſing his child ſo miſchieuouſly, moue you not to compaſſion, I ſuppoſe that all impunitie of vice and ſinne hathe place on your behalfe. I knowe neuertheleſſe, that at the firſt bluſhe, you will thinke ſtraunge of that I pretende to ſay vnto you, but the thing beeing well and exactly vnderſtoode, you ſhall be made certayne of my vprightneſſe, and of the iniquitie of him, whiche hath ſo gréeuouſly wounded my heart, that I feare it will cauſe my death, the whiche I woulde rather haue wiſhed a thouſande folde, than to ſee this lamentable and piteous Tragedie vpon my daughter, whome, I ſay, hathe bin trayterouſly ſlayne in hir

bedde by the deteſtable murtherer whiche you ſée, and whom amongſt all other I had choſen for the loyall ſpouſe and huſband of my daughter, and the ſucceſſor in time to come of the goods that God hath giuen me: You ſée ſir the euident ſignes & open marks howe ſhe hath bin ſtrangled, and it is well knowen that ſhe layde hir downe as ſound and mery as any of vs. Alas ſyr haue pitie on my deſolate houſe, venge with ye ſworde of Iuſtice the iniurie done to my daughter, and the heartbreake that afflicteth the ſoule of the father: puniſhe with extremitie the moſt miſchéeuous deede that euer was done in this countrey, to ſée ſo ſtraunge and barbarous crueltie of a huſbande, a man of ſuch qualitie and knowledge, yea the huſbande of one of the moſt vertuous Dames that mighte be founde, and neuertheleſſe without iuſt occaſion hath murthered hir as vniuſtly as he is miſchieuous and abhominable. Alas ſi, the onely hope I haue, is that euen the Gods wil make you to know the wicked acts of this vngracious mā, and thervpon to extend iuſtice, haue letted me to venge the wrong that I aſſure my ſelfe to haue receiued of this homicide. And willing

to continue his talke further, his tung fayling he began to weepe, in ſuch ſort that the Iudge moued to pitie, ſayde vnto the Doctor: You heare that which your father in Law ſayth agaynſt you, neuertheleſſe I ſee you not anſwere one poynt of thoſe accuſations that he hath laid before you. But the infamous and adulterous murtherer, iudged by the teſtimonie of his owne wycked conſcience, and condemned by the memorie of his filthy and abhominable factes paſte, coulde not expreſſe nor vtter one onely worde to refute and reproue the accuſation layde before hym by hys Father in Lawe. The Iudge hauing maruelled as muche as was poſſible of thys, knowing the Doctor to bée a man verye Eloquente, prompte, and readie in aunſwers, doubted exceedingly of his cace: & thus pondering and weying the matter within him ſelfe, he immediately deſired the iudgements of diuers expert and well learned Phiſitions and Surgeons, whiche all ſayde that the deceaſſed was dead by the violence of ſome one that had ſtrangled hir. Then the Iudge layde handes on the louer of the Lady of Chabry, and ſente

him to eſpouſe & marry the hole of the priſon houſe, in leu to enioy the free imbracements deſired in the premeditate bed of his wife promiſed, whom he would haue made lieftenant of his wife deceaſſed. The next day the corpes was ſet in a publike place, where both men and women of all eſtates did deplore hir with infinite teares, not without curſing a thouſand times the cruel fellon, which had cauſed to die ſo vertuous chaſt, & honeſt a wife, notwithſtanding the corpes was buried honorably in the collegeat church of the place, with ſuche lamentations and teares, that it appeared that a verie Matron of the Citie had finiſhed hir dayes. The Father ceaſed not too purſue the priſoner for the death of his daughter, & that with ſuch diligence that the priſoner was heard, & confeſſed the crime without queſtion or conſtraynt, which ſtroke ſuche horror into the heart of the Prouoſt, that he wrote thereof to the Lords of the Parliament of Aix, before whome the caſe was brought. The Lady of Chabry hauing vnderſtoode the diſcourſe of this Impriſonment, and the voluntarie confeſſion of the Doctor, knowing hir ſelfe to be gyltie of the

whole matter, and fearing the ſequell and future miſchéefe, leaſt he ſhould open and diſcouer all hir practiſes, and ſhoulde confeſſe all the murthers perpetrated in hir houſe, deliberated with hir ſelf to flée away before the tempeſt, leaſt the lightnings and thunderboltes thereof ſhoulde fall vppon hir head. Therefore taking with hir a good rounde ſumme of money, with the beſt of hir Iewels, ſhe retired to Poget in the territories of the D. of Sauoy. In the meane time the Doctor was led bounde towards the famous Citie of Aix, where his proceſſe béeing made, and he newly examined, confeſſed further all the enormities and deteſtable ſinnes that he had cōmitted with the L. of Chabry, without omitting any of the haynous murthers, the occaſion of them, & the names of the perſons by whom he had bin ayded concerning the ſame. The Court ſéeing the abhomination & gréeuouſneſſe of the cryme, condemned him to be led backe agayne to La graſſe, where he ſhould be executed in the publike place of the Towne, according to his demerites. This being don he was led back to the place where he was borne, and put agayne into priſon, within

the which hearing the day of his deathe to approch, bathed in teares, knowledging his ſinne, and earneſtly repenting him of hys faultes, knéeling down vpon the earth, and addreſſing his blubbered eies vnto the heauens, began to ſpeake in this ſort: Ah cruel fate, that from ſo highe degrée of honor and reputation, am nowe in one moment fallen into the depthe of infamie & perpetuall ſhame. O what a notable example maye they take in me, that put their confidence in the ſubtiltie of their iudgements and humayne prudence? what a looking glaſſe is offered to thoſe yt put neceſſitie to ye mobilitie of fortune? what a liuely picture am I, to aduertiſe ſecrete ſinners to acknowledge their faults, ſeeing that at the end the wicked liuers (althogh they haue long enioyed the contentments of their cruell appetites) they ſhall yet at the laſt be diſcouered with their iniquities, leauing (as I doo) their renowme defaced, & their life (which finally ſhall ende) ignomious, the memorie wherof ſhall be left to the poſteritie. This is the rod that beateth my ſoule, this onely thought is to me more gréeuous thā the death, the which I haue demerited, as beeing the

moſt miſchieuous & moſte curſed creature that euer nature brought foorth. This his oration thus ended, he was led to the place of execution, where he ended his wretched life, to the great contentment of his father in lawe, and all the dames of the countrey, ſauing that miſchieuous & miſerable dame the Lady of Chabry, which knowing that diligent inquiſition was made of the place wherevnto ſhe was retired, and that they went about by al meanes to recouer hir, to the ende to do iuſtice on hir, not knowing hir ſelfe ſufficiently aſſured in Poget, determined to take the way to Genes: and ſo hauing taken and tranſported hir baggage, tooke his iourney, accompanied with a gallant, who robbed hir of that ſhe had: after béeing in theſe extremities, ſhe addreſſed hir ſelfe to an honeſt widdowe, where declaring hir extreme neceſſitie, thys good widdowe receyued hir very beningly, and perceyuing hir by hir demeanours to be ſome Gentlewoman, cōmitted vnto hir hir daughters in gouernment. In thys houſe ſhe poorely (but much more honorably than ſhe deſerued) finiſhed hir dais. Thus in ſuch ſort ſhe which al hir life had cōmaunded &

ruled a great troupe of ſeruantes & maids, was now conſtrayned to obey vnto ſuche a one, which was muche inferior to hir: and agayne ſhée which in hir young yeares had béen delicately and with great care nouriſhed & brought vp, now drawing vpon the end of hir days, ſhe ſuffred perpetual exile, ſubiect to the pleaſure of another, preſt and ready (as ſhe did in déede) to die out of hir country, & to receyue ſepulcher in another place, then in the Monument & tombe of hir Progenitors. This is then the ende of the vnhoneſt loue of theſe laciuious adultrers: beholde the frutes of a trée ſo deteſtable & pernitious. Theſe are the pleaſures that in the ende accompanie theſe inordinate louers, ſée howe the lowryng eyes of beautyes vading Ioyes hath ſo inchaunted theſe Venerians, that now quite forgetting all grace and goodnes do plunge them ſelues in the pitte of perpetull ſhame and infamie: beholde whither thys outragious and beaſtly luſt couered with the name of pure and earneſt loue, is able to draw theſe gentle ſubiects, to cauſe them to commit moſt heynouſe murthers, to imbrue theyr hands in the ſhedding of innocent bloud.
            
               This Hiſtory thus finiſhed, my thought was very ſtraunge, but in ſpecially to be told in Venus Court, which tēded ſo much to the deprauation of her Lawes, wherfore I aſked of Lady Countenance, what he ſhould be that had vſed ſuch lauiſh ſpeache: who aunſwered, that it was one Bandelio, an Italian, not far vnlyke in condicions, to the Emperour Marcus Aurelius, who many times vſed by words to inuay againſte that which actually he ſo much frequented, ſo ther be many which with ſharp and bitter words, wil outwardly ſeme to reproue ſuch as yelde themſelues to loue, and yet in their déedes ſhew thēſelues ſo earneſt profeſſours of Venus and her Lawes, as they worthely demerite to be ſhryned Saints. But aboue all theſe deuiſes, I had a ſpeciall regard to the bewti of the Chamber which was wonderful to behold. In the middle of the Roofe ther was artificially wrought, a knot of maſſy gold, in maner foure ſquare, and in the middeſt of this knot was placed a ſtone of a marueilous bigneſſe, whoſe brightnes did ſo excede, that it daſeled my eyes, I was not able to behould it in euery ſquare, ther was likewiſe ſet a rich Emeraud,
               
from the which there iſſued forthe a Vine, in maner of a fret, which ſpreading all the Chamber, as was wonderfull to be holde, the braunches and leaues were all of pure Golde, curiouſly Enameled, in ſtede of Grapes, the Rubyes ther did ſhine which were correſpondent to the reſidew of the worke, the hangings wer al of Arras, very richly wrought. In which was expreſſed the pitifull Hiſtory, of Romeus and Iuletta, Giſmonda and Guiſtairdo, Piramus & Thiſbe, Liuio and Camilla, and of many other louing wightes, who in regarde of Venus Law, had indured many bitter torments, and yelded themſelues to martirdome.
            Hauing paſſed this Chamber, we came into a Gallery, which in curioſitie, or workmanſhip, in euery reſpect, was as far exceding the reſt, as Phebus Rayes, of light, excedeth euery other Starre, in the vpper ende wherof, ther were many worthy Dames, whoſe bewty might welbe compared to the place. Well now, quoth Lady Countenance, thou muſt make quick diſpatch, be hould wher Mars and Venus are now here in place, with ye I eſpyed wher Mars was layed in Venus Lap, before whome, kneling

on both my knées, ſayde as followeth.
            
               O mighty Mars, O dreadfull God,His requeſt to the Gods. to whom it wholly doth belong, to geue victory, and conqueſt, the only ſtay and comfort, of euery valyant heart, loe heare the Supplicacions, of poore dyſtreſſed wyghtes, the which in their behalfes, I humbly here preſent, wherby thou maiſt perceiue the ſumme of all theyr gréefe.
            
            With which words he aroſe, and I kiſſing the Supplication, deliuered it into his hand, which when he had throughly peruſed, ſayd as followeth.
            And are Souldiers then ſo ſlenderly accompted of,Mars maketh aunſweare. be thei ſo lightly regarded now in this peaceable tyme, who in the time of warres, muſt offer thēſelues to the ſlaughter, for theyr Countries defence, well vngratefull Country, and moſt vnthankfull people, I perceiue your quiet ſtate, dothe make you to forget both me and myne, but take hede you be not more ſodainly ouertaken then you be aware of, when you will wyſh, you were as well furniſhed with expert Souldyers, as you are prouided with other warlike prouiſions, your enemies be as ſecret as they be malicious.
            
               And as he was abought to procede in farther talke, the Goddes Venus ſodainely aroſe in a great rage, as it ſemed, turning her ſelfe toward me▪
               Venus checketh the Souldier. and ſayd as followeth.
            A ſyr, and is this the cauſe of your repayer to my Courte, I now perceiue right well, the wholl cyrcumſtaunce of your pretence, bicauſe your vnbrydled mynds haue bene of late reſtrayned, whereby you haue wāted ſome part of your vngracious wils, you haue therfore amongſt you made a byl of complaynte, thinking your ſelues to be greatly iniured, when in déede you are but iuſtly plauged, and yet nothing in reſpectt, according to your deſeruings, your malicious myndes, are not to me vnknowne, you hate the good hap of any one that is not of your own profeſſion, it greueth you that any ſhold be preferrid before you. You think ye princes before all others, ſhold beſtow offices & promociōs vpon you, to be ſhort you deſpiſe al other in reſpect of your ſelues, & yet you your ſelues would not be deſpyſed, you hate al, & you wold be beloued, how euident theſe matters be, I think may wel be perceued, when it pleaſeth you to beſtow ſo many nice names, & other rope rype terms,

vppon ſuch as be my ſubiectes, and profeſſours of my Lawes, geuing them the tytle of Carpet knights.
            But if al be Carpet Knights which hath ſubmitted to my beheſtes, I truſt you may put the greateſt parte of your moſt renowned Souldiers and Captaines in the number.
            Was not Hercules that noble conquerour, conquered him ſelf by loue with Dianayra, was not the fierſe Achiles in like maner with Polixena, & Troilus with Creſſid, was not Alexander when hée ſhould haue geuen battayle to the Amazons comming to a Riuers ſide, wher beholding ye Quéene he was ſo ſubdued, that their fierſe and cruell fight conuerted to wanton amorous wordes. Was not Haniball in like maner ſtayd in Capra, and Iulius Caeſer in Alexandria. But here ouer paſſing a great number of others, is not your god of battail him ſelf obedient to my will, and yet a many of you who in reſpecte are but reprobate perſons, would prefer your ſelues to be more worthy then any of theſe.
            Theſe wordes thus pronounced by the goddes, did daūt me ſo with ſuch diſpayre,

that I ne wiſt what aunſweare I might make, which being perceyued by the God of battayle, ſayd as foloweth.
            
               Mars taketh vp the matterWell well Lady deare, if I ſhould aunſwer theſe cauſes effectually, peraduenture I might vſe greater vehemency in wordes then I willingly would, but yet I wold not wiſh that any of theſe before named ſhould be regeſtred, amongſt that effeminate number, although I am not ignoraunt that not only theſe but alſo many other valiaunte Captaynes and noble Souldiers, hath bin obedient to the lawes of loue, for who commonlye are more ſubiecte to loue then the moſt valiaunt mynded wight, and who ſoner diſdayned by a number of ſcornefull dames, who wil rather except of thoſe that are in déed but Metamorphiſis hauing but the ſhapes of men, or that are as Hermaphroditus halfe men, halfe women, ſuch as wil ly rowling in a Ladies lap kiſſing her hands, feeding hyr eares with philed flattering talke.
            But how ſhould theſe womanlike mynded men, or any other of theſe louing wormes, inioy their delightes in ſuch quiet maner, were not the noble Souldier to backe

them, who is the very Wal and only Bulwark to defend them.
            Wherfore deare dame you haue no iuſt cauſe thus to exclayme on Souldiers, on whoſe valiauncy, principally depēdeth the quiet eſtate of ſuch as be your ſubiects and profeſſors of your law, which elſe might remayne a pray for euery man if cauſes wer thorowly conſidered.
            Well then qd. the Goddes Venus,
               Venus is perſwaded. what ſimplicicie might be imputed vnto vs, betwéene whom ther hath bin ſuch familiaritie, and that of ſo long continuaunce, and ſhould now ſéeme to contend about ſo ſlender occaſion: agayne it ſéemeth vnto me as good reaſon, that as great frindſhip and familiaritie ſhuld be continued between ſuch as be our profeſſoures, on eyther pa
                  •
               te, as there is loue and amitie betwéene vs our ſelues, and for my parte from henceforth I will yeld my ſelfe beholding vnto Souldiers, promiſing them my fartheraunce in any thing, wherin I may pleaſure them.
            Theſe ioyfull newes did bréede in mée ſuch a ſodayne alteration from diſpayre,The Souldier awaketh. to comfort, from dolful doubt to aſſured hope, from mourning to myrth, that in the middeſt

of al theſe ſurmounting ioyes, ſodainly awaked, perceiuing my ſelf to be but deluded by a dreame which I haue thus rudly penned, deſiring the gentle reader to beare with my infirmitie, and to mend that is amiſſe.
            FINIS.
