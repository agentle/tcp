               Where others (who might better) yet forslow it,
               May see their shame, and times hereafter know it.

                     Heauen is Gods seat, the throne of endles grace:

                  ALl powers are subiect to the power of Heauen.
                  Nothing but Heauen, is perfect happinesse.
                  What heauen will haue, that needs must come to passe.
                  The Soule is heauenly, and from heauen relieu'd.
                  Heauen is as neere to sea, as to the land.
                  Heauen sings for ioy, when sinners truly pray.
                  The waking heauens will plague all sleeping ill.
                  
                     When as the heauens are to iustice bent,
                  
                  
                     All things are turn'd to our iust punishment.
                  
                  None can attaine what heauen and earth withstands.
                  Earth must come in, when awfull heauen commaunds.
                  When heauen yeelds meanes, they must not be neglect.
                  Though men reuenge not, yet the heauens will.
                  Heauen is the habitation of th'elect.
                  Heauen is the iust mans true inheritance.
                  
                     It's hard to liue well, easie to dye ill:
                  
                  
                     Hard to winne heauen, easie to keepe from thence.
                  
                  In vaine do men contend against the starres.
                  
                     Heauen workes our fall, but yet the fault is ours.
                  All men ought know they haue the Heauens aboue them.
                  No walles can hide vs from the eye of heauen.
                  Repentance carries heauens eternall keyes.
                  When heauens lampe shines, all other lights are lost.

                     AS hell was made to punish sinnes proud guilt,
                     Euen so was heauen for comfort of the iust.
                     As base clothes ill become a princes court,
                     So none can enter heauen but purely clad.
                     As trauailers desire their natiue homes,
                     So should all soules long for their heauenly home.
                     As hells obscuritie excells all darke,
                     So nothing with heauens brightnesse may compare.
                     As Iacob for his Rachell thought sower sweet,
                     So we for heauen ought deeme all else but vile.
                     As all ioyes in this life are fraile and vaine,

                     Conscience is that accuseth and condemnes,

                  In conscience booke, our faults are daily writ.
                  There conscience failes, where faith beares no account.
                  A guiltie conscience neuer is secure.

                  Conscience needs no tormenter but it selfe.

                     So truth most pleaseth in her plainest clothes.
                     As wormwood fitteth not a lickerish taste,
                     So truth doth neuer please a lyars tongue.
                     As clouds oft threaten raine, and yet shed none,
                     So stormes oft menace truth, yet hurt her not.
                     As darkenesse is an enemie to light,
                     So falshood is continuall foe to truth.
                     As meane attire impaires not beauties face,
                     So poorest ragges to truth giue no disgrace.

               Of Vertue.
               
                  
                     Vertue, is Queene of labour, Nource of loue:
                     The minds true grace, and blessing from aboue.
                  
               
               
                  ALl things decay, but vertue cannot die.
                  Vertue makes beautie more angelicall.
                  Vertue is free from time, and fortunes power.
                  
                     Men cannot leaue their vertues to their heires.
                  
                     Faire vertues seat is deepe within the mind,
                  
                  
                     And not by shewes, but inward thoughts defin'd.
                  
                  Vices are noted, vertues soone forgot.
                  Vertues best store, by giuing doth augment.
                  There is no vertue that is borne with vs.
                  No vertue springs, where wanteth due regard.
                  
                     Vertues obscurde, yeeld small and sorie gaines:
                  
                  
                     But actiuely employd, true worth-retaines.
                  
                  Winne fame by vertue, let opinion goe.
                  Vertue is in the mind, not the attire.
                  Vertue and fortune neuer could agree.
                  Vertue is loath'd of fooles, lou'd of the wise.
                  
                     Vertue is much more amiable and sweet,
                  
                  
                     When therewithall true maiestie doth meet.
                  
                  Vice careth not if vertue sinke or swimme.
                  Wit shines in vertue, vertue shines in wit.
                  Sweetest temptations most make vertue knowne.
                  
                     Vertue it selfe turnes vice, being misapplyed:
                  
                  
                     And vice sometimes by action dignified.
                  
                  The field of honour, vertue neuer looseth.
                  Vertue will beare what can on vertue fall.
                  True happinesse, on vertue taketh ground.
                  The more vice reignes, the lesse doth vertue thriue.
                  
                     To vertues goods we onely ought to cleane,

                        , but deceaue.
                  
                  Vertue will liue when villanie shall die.
                  Vertue may be disturb'd, but ne're disgrac'd.
                  No beautie like the vertue of the mind.
                  Vertue through darkest shades doth light her selfe.
                  
                     Vertue in greatest daungers being best showne,
                  
                  
                     May be opprest, but neuer ouerthrowne.
                  
                  Vertue oft lyes where life is in disgrace.
                  If sinne were dead, vertue could not be knowne.
                  
                     Sweet is the gaine which vertuous trauaile brings▪
                  
                  All vertuous minds doe vertuous deeds declare.
                  
                     Our vices nor our vertues neuer die,
                  
                  
                     Though vnder ground a thousand yeares we lye.
                  
                  Vertue doth mortall things immortall make.
                  The bond of vertue alwaies surest binds.
                  Than vertue, there can be no greater dower.
                  'Tis vertues selfe, that her rewards doth pay.
                  Enuies black cloud would dim bright vertues rayes.
                  
                     All sorrowes in the world are farre more lesse,
                  
                  
                     Than vertues might and valours confidence.
                  
                  Sinne counted solace, vertue is despisde.
                  Vaine praise is shame, but honour vertues due.
                  Without defence of vertue, nothing lasts.
                  
                     Onely faire vertue scales eternitie,

                  All Orators are dumbe when vertue pleads.
                  Vertue but stampt in Lead, is rich enough.
                  That growes apace which vertue helpes to raise.
                  Vertue curbes in the most vnbridled will.

                     Where states are ripe to fall, and vertue spent.
                  
                  True vertue is rich dower for chastitie.
                  In vertuous deeds all stratagems are good.
                  Vertue is beautie of the inward man.
                  Exclude discretion, vertue turnes to vice.
                  Like to the Sunne, so vertue lights the world.

                  Vertue will shine though ne're so much obscur'd.
                  Vertue depressed, is expressed more.
                  Vertue makes women seeme to be diuine.
                  With honours eyes let vertues plaints be scand.
                  
                     Vertue doth raise by very small degrees,
                  
                  
                     
                     Where in a moment Fortune casteth downe.
                  
                  While vertue suffers, still it vanquisheth.
                  Need clad with vertue, is aboundant rich.
                  Vertue is better and more sure than Artes.
                  Vertue is not to get things, but to keepe them.
                  
                     Vertue on earth doth soonest bring vs fame,
                  
                  
                     Makes our graues glorious, writes our names in heauen.
                  
                  Vertue most grieueth at her owne disgrace.
                  A vertuous act seemes straunge in some mens sight.
                  A vertuous mind cannot be miserable.
                  Death is true life to euery vertuous man.
                  
                     Though vertue many times wants due reward,
                  
                  
                     Yet seldome vice escapes deserued blame.
                  
                  Vertue doth neuer enuie good desert.
                  Loue maketh vertue liue, and vice to die.
                  Reports can neuer harme the vertuous.
                  He is not vertuous that's too timerous.

                  Vertues are many times by faults disgrac'd.
                  Honours defects, by vertues are supplyed.
                  Vertue still doteth on perfection.
                  Vertue, in beauteous bodies shineth best.

               Of Hope.
               
                  
                     Hope is the sad hearts help, the sick thoughts friend,
                     And what distrust impaires, Hope doth amend.
                  
               
               
                  ALl hope is vaine without the feare of God.
                  Hope, on each least occasion taketh hold.
                  Hope doth forbid vs sorrow to beleeue.
                  When loue growes sickely, hope then daily sterues.
                  Things out of hope, by ventring oft are woon.
                  Hope many times on blessed hap doth light.
                  When hope is lost in care then comfort bleeds.
                  
                     Vnworthy he of grace, whome once deniall
                  
                  
                     Excludes from fairest hope, without more triall.
                  
                  All foolish hopes haue euermore bad speed.
                  Councell doth come too late when hope is past.
                  Men well may hope to rise, but feare to fall.
                  Its good to hope the best, but feare the worst.
                  Chaunging the aire, hopes time will alter chance.
                  Despaire and hope doe still attend on loue.
                  
                     Its good to feare, yet let our feare be so,
                  
                  
                     That to our hope it prooue no ouerthrow.
                  
                  Oft present hap, makes future hope to yeeld.
                  
                     No hap so hard but hope doth much amend.
                  Hope to enioy, is little lesse than ioy.
                  Honour once lost, giues farewell to all hope.
                  Vnhappie men are subiect to no hope.
                  Fortune may take our goods, but not our hope.
                  
                     The heart that's inly hurt, is greatly easd,
                  
                  
                     With hope of that may make griefe best appeasd.
                  
                  Hopes are vnsure, when certaine is the paine.
                  We often fall, when most we hope to clime.
                  As wee waxe hopelesse, violence still growes.
                  Hope well in loue what euer be thy hap.
                  Hope is the daily dreame of waking men.
                  This life, is but the hope of endlesse life.

                     That will not take the offer of good hope.
                  
                  There is no trust in youth, nor hope in age.
                  The hope of things vnseene beares greatest price.
                  Good conscience alwaie hath a perfect hope.
                  Hope is a pleasing passion of the mind.
                  To hope against all hope, is high resolue.
                  
                     True hope is swift, and flyes with swallowes wings,
                  
                  
                     Kings it makes Gods, and meaner creatures Kings.
                  
                  Inconstant hope is drowned oft in feares.
                  In midst of griefe, hope alway hath some part.
                  Hope being deluded makes the torment more.
                  Who cannot feare to loose, ne're hopes to haue.
                  All greedie hope, vaine vicious humour feeds.
                  Hope is companion euermore to loue.
                  
                     No one without great hopes, will follow such,
                  
                  
                     Whose power and honour doth not promise much.
                  
                  No hope of rest, where hap true hope delayes.
                  Hope still perswading hope, expecteth good.
                  Hope is the God of miserable men.
                  In vaine he hopes, who here his hope doth ground.
                  
                     From fruitlesse hopes but sillie fauours spring.
                  The euenings hope may comfort mornings care.

                     But grounded once on God, at no time failes.
                  
                  Hope is the bread and food of wretched men.
                  Bad haps are holpe with hope and good beliefe.
                  No greater griefe in loue, than fruitlesse hope.

                     To hope too much, is boldly to presume:
                  
                  
                     To hope too little,

                  Meane mens preferments eleuates their hopes.
                  Sad hopes seeme ouer long and burdenous.

                     As sadnes is the hearts chiefe punishment,
                     So hope is highest helpe in deepe distresse.
                     
                        As one part of the body toiles for all,
                     So hope striues to accomplish all desires.
                     As euery mettall is of Sulphur made,
                     So euery pleasure doth from hope proceed.
                     As honest pastimes can no way offend,
                     So good mens hopes must needs haue happy end.

                     Learned men differ from the ignorant
                     (As Bias saith) but onely by their Hope.

                     Is the sole guide and gouernour of men.
                  
               
            
            
               
               Of Loue.
               
                  
                     Loue is a vertue, measur'd by duteous choice,
                     But not if it be maim'd with wilfull chaunce.
                  
               
               
                  TRue loue is simple like his mother Truth.
                  Firme and vntainted loue, had neuer meane.
                  In long delay, loue most impatient is.
                  Our treasure we may hide, but not our loue.
                  The truest loue is most suspitious.
                  Loues eyes in looking neuer haue their fill.
                  
                     MAY is not loues month, MAY is full of flowers,
                  
                  
                     But dropping APRIL: Loue is full of showers.
                  
                  Leud loue breeds losse, ill peace hath deadly fight.
                  Life is most loath'd, where loue may not preuaile.
                  Loue is the mistresse of a many minds.
                  Loues little sweet, oft finds a longer sower.
                  Loue's like the winters Rose, or Sommers Ice.
                  Loue where it likes, life where it loues would be.
                  
                     Loue doth desire the thing belou'd to see,
                  
                  
                     That like it selfe in louely shape may be.
                  
                  As loue is loth to part, so seare shunnes death.
                  Luke warme desires best fit with crazed loue.
                  
                     Valour nor loue dwells where diuision is.
                  Nought worth is loue without true constancie.
                  Loue cannot sound well, but in louers tongues.
                  Loues strongest bands, vnkindnes doth vnbind.
                  
                     Firme loue that is in gentle brests begun,
                  
                  
                     No idle charme may easily remooue.
                  
                  Short is the ioy of him that longest loues.
                  Loue neuer can endure a Paragon.
                  The greater loue, the greater is the losse.
                  True loue is often sowne, but seldome growes.
                  Loose loues are vaine, and vanish still to smoake.
                  Loue, that two hearts makes one, so frames one will.
                  
                     Too hard a lesson tis for liuing clay,
                  
                  
                     From loue (in course of nature) to refraine.
                  
                  Firme loue, the dread of daunger doth despise.
                  Loue may not be compeld by masterie.
                  Sweet loue barres lewdnesse from his companie.
                  Causelesse to chaunge loue, is most foule reproch.
                  Loue hateth thought of all vngentlenes.
                  A louers heauen must passe by sorrowes hell.
                  
                     All losse is lesse, yea lesse is infamie,
                  
                  
                     Than losse of loue to him that loues but one.
                  
                  They cannot iudge of loue, that ne're did loue.
                  Loue wants his eyes, yet shoots he passing right.
                  The shrine of loue doth seldome offrings want.
                  What can be said, that louers cannot say?
                  Blind loues, best Poets haue imperfect sight.
                  Loue deeply grounded, hardly is dissembled.
                  
                     Loue is a fiend, a fire, a heauen, a hell,
                  
                  
                     Where pleasure, paine, and sad repentance dwell.
                  
                  Where both deliberate, the loue is light.
                  True loue is mute, and oft amazed stands.
                  Who euer lou'd, that lou'd not at first sight?
                  The darkest night is Cupids brightest day.
                  
                     Loue alwaies makes those eloquent that loue.
                  There's nothing more than counsell, louers hate.
                  
                     The light of hidden fire, it selfe discouers:
                  
                  
                     And loue that is conceald betraies poore louers.
                  
                  A louer most restraind, the worser fares.
                  Loue is too full of faith, too credulous.
                  Great force and vertue hath a louing looke.
                  No stonie limits can hold out true loue.
                  What loue can doe, that dare it still attempt.
                  Sweet are those bands that true loue doth combine.
                  
                     Loue goes toward loue like schoole-boyes from their bookes:
                  
                  
                     But loue from loue, to schoole with heauie lookes.
                  
                  No loue so sweet as where both soules consent.
                  True perfect loue is quickest of beleefe.
                  It's better loue and liue, than loath and die.
                  Free vent of words, loues fire doth asswage.
                  Lookes doe kill loue, and loue by lookes reuiues.
                  Foule words and frownes will not compell a louer.
                  
                     Louers well wot, what griefe it is to part,
                  
                  
                     When twixt two bodies liueth but one heart.
                  
                  Loue easily commenteth on euery woe.
                  Loues gentle spring doth alwaies fresh remaine.
                  Loue maketh young men thrall, and old men dote.

                  It is not loue, that loues to anger loue.
                  Loue still is free and led with selfe-delight.
                  Sweet is the loue that comes with willingnes.
                  
                     Who learnes to loue, the lesson is so plaine:

                     Great talke of loue proceeds but from the tongue.
                  Loue makes blunt wits, right pleasing Oratours.
                  All loue deceits are held excusable.
                  Loue is most sweet and faire in euery thing.

                     But pleasing of her husband, and chast life,
                  
                  No princes wealth can prize true chastitie.
                  
                     The browne complexion fam'd for chastitie,
                  
                  
                     Exceedeth farre the fair'st suspected beautie.
                  
                  No life to libertie, no loue like chastitie.
                  
                     Chastitie beautifies the meanest coat,
                  
                  
                     Better than blame in richest clothing clad.
                  
                  Beautie vnchast is reckned nothing worth.
                  
                     Chastitie, weakely can withstand proud wealth
                  
                  
                     And dignitie, both leagued to assault.
                  
                  Chastitie is the crowne of happy life.
                  
                     In wedlocke, chastitie is speciall good:
                  
                  
                     But more, in virgins life and widowhood.
                  
                  Chastities wrongs, bondage awarrants not.
                  
                     Chastitie is the beautie of the soule,
                  
                  
                     The ioy of heauen, best iewell here on earth.
                  
                  Wanton desire, chast lookes doth often hide.
                  
                     Chastitie, charitie, and humilitie,
                  
                  
                     Are the united vertues of the soule.
                  
                  Frugalitie is badge of chastitie.
                  
                     Beautie vnchast, is like the Mandrakes fruit,
                  
                  
                     Sightly in shew, but poysonous in tast.
                  
                  Idlenes is the foe to chastitie.
                  
                     Nothing in women worthy praise remaines,
                  
                  
                     If once their (glorie) chastitie be lost.
                  
                  Where gold's too plentie, chastitie growes cheape.
                  
                     Faire is the face which promiseth pure loue,
                  
                  
                     
                     But that celestiall, liues by chastitie.
                  
                  Fortitude, with chast life, adorne the soule.
                  
                     Shee is not chast that is by feare compeld:
                  
                  
                     Neither she honest, that with need is wonne.
                  
                  Modest and chast, is dourie rich enough.
                  
                     Chastitie in extremitie is knowne,
                  
                  
                     And in the end crownd with eternitie.
                  
                  A wandring eye bewrayes an vnchast mind.
                  With reasons reines, chastitie bridles lust.
                  
                     Where needie want is ioynd with chastitie,
                  
                  
                     There vncleane life gets some authoritie.
                  
                  Chast eares cannot endure dishonest talke.
                  The modest eye controlles loues wanton ryot.
                  Chast modest thoughts beseeme a woman best.
               
               
                  Similies on the same subiect.
                  
                     AS beautie lookes like flowers in the spring,
                     So chastitie is like the starres of heauen.
                     As Violets smell sweet in any sente,
                     So chastitie shines bright in euery eye.
                     As water-drops will pearce the hardest flint,
                     So chast resolue o'recomes the proudest lust.
                     As glasses broke, can neuer be repaird,
                     So chastitie once lost, is ne're restor'd.
                     As lust and libertie doth shorten life,
                     So chastitie makes endlesse liue the soule.
                     As champions by their manhood are best knowne,
                     So is good life by spotlesse chastitie.

               Of Beautie.
               
                  
                     Beautie is Natures priuiledge, a close deceit,
                     A short times tyrant, and vast Monarchie.
                  
               
               
                  BEautie but seldome seene, makes vs admire it.
                  Beautie is such a bait, that (swallowed) choakes.
                  Beauties best treasure, is the owners harme.
                  Selfe-pleasing soules doe play with beauties baites.
                  
                     There is no name (if shee be false or not)
                  
                  
                     But being faire, some enuious tongue will blot.
                  
                  Beautie doth varnish age, as if new borne.
                  Where faire is not, no boor to paint the brow.
                  Beautie being borrowed, merits no regard.
                  
                     Simples fit beautie, fie on drugs or Art.
                  
                     Beautie doth sweetly quicken when 'tis nigh:
                  
                  
                     But distant farre, murders, where 'tis belou'd.
                  
                  Seldome want guests where beautie bids the feast.
                  Care and suspition is faire beauties dower.
                  Beautie brings perill, wanting safe protection.
                  Beautie at death can be bequeath'd to none.

                  Nice fooles delight to be accounted faire.
                  Beautie is soonest lost, too choicely kept.
                  Beautie to beautie alwaies is benigne.
                  Beautie within it selfe should not be wasted.
                  
                     Bright beautie is the bait, which with delight,
                  
                  
                     Doth most allure man to encrease his kind.
                  
                  Beautie and wealth are fraught with coy disdaine.
                  Beautie is often with it selfe at strife.
                  True beautie needs no other ornament.
                  Men praise the face, yet blame the flintie mind.
                  
                     The fairest flower of beautie fades away,
                  
                  
                     Like the fresh Lillie in the Sun-shine day.
                  
                  Swift time makes wrinkles in the fairest brow.
                  Faire women grieue to thinke they must be old.
                  Pittie and smiles doe best become the faire.
                  Beautie hath priuiledge to checke all dutie.
                  
                     All things that faire, that pure, and glorious been,
                  
                  
                     Offer themselues on purpose to be seene.
                  
                  Alluring shewes most deepe impression strike.
                  Sweetly it fits the faire to wantonnize.
                  Nothing but crueltie misseemes the faire.
                  Beautie is nothing if it be not seene.
                  
                     No greater corsiue to our blooming yeeres,
                  
                  
                     Than the cold badge of winter-blasted haires.
                  
                  Beautie will be where is the most resort.
                  
                     Beautie is mightie, yet her strength but weake.
                  Beautie like Autumne fades and falls away.
                  Beautie hath power to ouercome the strong.
                  
                     Faire flowers that are not gathered in their prime.

                  By clouds of care best beauties are defac'd.
                  Beautie being shamelesse, soemes a loath some sight.
                  Amongst faire Roses grow some stinking weeds.
                  
                     The fairer and more beautifull the skie,
                  
                  
                     The ouglier seeme the clouds that in it lye.
                  
                  Nothing so soone allures as beautie doth.
                  Religion is austere, but beautie mild.
                  The fair'st in shew must carrie all away.
                  At fairest signes, best welcome is surmiz'd.
                  
                     Beautie in heauen and earth this grace doth win,
                  
                  
                     It supples rigor, and it lessens sinne.
                  
                  Dainties are made for tast, beautie for vse.
                  Seeds spring from seeds, and beauty beauty breedeth.
                  Beautie oft crazeth like a broken glasse.
                  Both old and young, and all would fairest be.
                  
                     Hardly perfection is so absolute,
                  
                  
                     But some impuritie doth it pollute.
                  
                  A small fault soone impaires the sweetest beautie.
                  The verie fairest hath her imperfection.
                  Beautie to dwell with woe, deformes it selfe.
                  As fairest beautie fades, so loue growes cold.
                  
                     Beautie it selfe, doth of it selfe perswade
                  
                  
                     The eyes of men, without an Oratour.
                  
                  If beautie were not, loue were quite confounded.
                  The fairest flowers haue not the sweetest smell.
                  The painted face sets forth no perfect blood.
                  The beautie of the mind excels the face.
                  
                     Desire being Pilot, and bright beautie prize.

                  Beautie is able sorrow to beguile.
                  There's none so faire, whose beautie all respect.
                  The fairest buds are soonest nipt with frosts.
                  Who builds on beautie, builds but for a while.
                  
                     Beautie is cuer held so much more faire,
                  
                  
                     By how much lesse her hate makes loue despaire.
                  
                  That's quickly staind, which is the purest fine.
                  In fairest stone small raine soone makes a print.
                  Ill fare that faire which inwardly is foule.

                     Yet grasse is greene, when fairest flowers decay.
                  
                  The loue of beautie, Reason quite forgets.
                  The cause of loue is only beauties lookes.
                  Beautie and youth once banisht, ne're returne.
                  Chast thoughts makes beautie be immortallizd.
                  
                     Faire beautie is the sparke of hot desire,
                  
                  
                     And sparkes in time will kindle to a fire.
                  
                  Sicknesse and age are beauties chiefest foes.
                  Weeds oft times grow, when fairest flowers fade.
                  Beautie is like a faire, but fading flower.
                  Where beautie most abounds, there wants most ruth.
                  
                     The goodliest gemme being blemisht with a cracke,
                  
                  
                     Looseth both beautie and the vertue too.
                  
                  Beautie doth whet the wit, makes bold the will.
                  Beautie makes Art to worke beyond it selfe.
                  Vnhonest beautie is a deadly poyson.
                  Vertue-Iesse beautie doth deserue no Ioue.
                  
                     The fairest flower nipt with the winters frost,
                  
                  
                     In shew seemes worser than the basest weed.
                  
                  The perfect glasse of vertue, beautie is.
                  No bait so sweet as beautie, to the eye.
                  White seemes the fairer when as blacke is by.
                  
                     The purest Lawne is apt for euery staine.
                  
                     Better it is with beautie to be blinded,
                  
                  
                     Than beauties graces should be blindly minded.
                  
                  Beautie is tearm'd the mistresse of delight.
                  Beautie oft iniures them endued there with.
                  Beautie enflates and puffeth vp the mind.
                  Humilitie with beautie seldome is.
                  
                     Beautie brings fancie to a daintie feast,

                     Iealousie is hells torment to the mind,

                  Suspect bewraies our thoughts, betraies our words.
                  Suspitious eyes are messengers of woe.
                  Iealous suspect is linked with despaire.

                  Art hath a world of secrets in her power.
                  There is no age ought thinke too late to learne.

                  Oft highest worthes are paid with spightfull hire.
                  Art is but base, with them that know it not.

                     This fault is euer incident to kings,
                  
                  
                     Too much to credit ouer pleasing things.
                  
                  Princes respect their honour more than blood.
                  To be a Prince, is more than be a man.
                  
                     The man that at a subiects use doth anne,

                  A kings great name makes not his fault the lesse.
                  Desire of soueraigntie respects no faith.

                  The threats of kings are like the thunders noise.
                  Kings haue long armes, and rulers reach at large.
                  
                     Princes are as the glasse, the schoole, the booke,
                  
                  
                     VVhere subiects eyes doe learne, doe read, doe looke.
                  
                  Maiestie shines like lightning from the East.
                  A princes will ought not exceed his law.
                  
                     Mildnesse doth better sute with maiestie,
                  
                  
                     Than rash reuenge, and rough seueritie.
                  
                  Princes desires are many times corrupt.
                  Princes oft fauour flatterers more than friends.
                  
                     Kings doe approach the nearest vnto God,
                  
                  
                     By giuing life and safetie to their people.
                  
                  Vnworthie mens preferment, shames the prince.
                  Kings Courts are held as vniuersall schooles.
                  
                     Succeeding heapes of plagues doe teach too late,
                  
                  
                     To learne the mischiefes of misgnided state.
                  
                  Kings by example sinne more than by act.
                  Kings seates for soules distrest, are sanctuaries.
                  
                     The youth of Princes haue no bounds for sinne,
                  
                  
                     Vnlesse them-selues doe make them bounds within.
                  
                  Princes oft purchase quiet with price of wrong.
                  Wish for good princes, but endure the ill.
                  
                     Subiects may well complaine, but not correct
                  
                  
                     A princes faults, they beare more high respect.
                  
                  No ruler yet could euer all content.
                  The face of kings makes faultie subiects feare.
                  
                     
                     Kings, Lords of times and of occasions,
                  
                  
                     May take aduantage when and how they list.
                  
                  It's hard to rule, and please both good and bad.
                  New kings doe feare when old Courts furder straine.
                  
                     Poore maiestie, that other men must guide:

                  When princes worke, who then will idle stand?
                  Peasants may beare, but kings must needs requite.

                  A princes wrath is messenger of death.
                  What els is pompe, rule, raigne; but earth and dust?
                  
                     Kings must haue some be hated worse than they,
                  
                  
                     On whome they may their weight of enuie lay.
                  
                  Pride is no ornament for diademes.
                  Selfe-loue doth very ill beseeme a prince.
                  
                     Blest is that league, where citties further Kings,
                  
                  
                     And kings doe further them in other things.
                  
                  Kings that would haue lawes kept, must rule themselues.
                  Graue heads are meetest Councellors for kings.
                  
                     Looke what a King doth most of all embrace,

                  The strength of princes is their subiects loue.
                  Kings ought be free from partialitie.

                     TO Plutarch did the Emperour Traiane write,
                     Only to counsell him what he should doe.
                     The Emperour Galba said; All his mishaps
                     Ensued, because he would not be aduis'de.
                     
                        Demetrius of Maccdon would say:
                     Reprooue me, when I councell doe refuse.
                     
                        Verres had neuer fallen in miscrie,
                     But that good counsell alwaies he despis'd.

                  True iustice payes the bloodie home their hire.
                  Blood spilt by wrong, calls vengeance scourge by right.

                  Societie must be preseru'd by pollicie.

                     As subtiltie is slye to helpe it selfe,
                     So pollicie is wise to shield it selfe.
                     As daungers felt are worse than others fear'd,
                     So pollicies not executed, most offend.

               Of Peace & Concord.
               
                  
                     Peace is the ground of kingdoms happinesse:
                     Nource of true concord, loue, and all encrease.
                  
               
               
                  PEace is great riches in the poorest state.
                  
                     Men know not peace, nor rightly how to deeme it,
                  
                  
                     That first by warre haue not been taught 
                           •
                        'esteems it.
                  
                  
                     Peace hath best biding in a setled mind.
                  
                     Peace brings in pleasure, pleasure breeds excesse:
                  
                  
                     Excesse procureth want, want workes distresse.
                  
                  Peace doth depend on reason, warre on force.
                  
                     You whose faire calme make neighbors storms seeme sore,
                  
                  
                     Try you your tydes, before you trust the shore.
                  
                  Peace, all extreames concludeth with remorse.
                  
                     Sourges may rise on suddaine ere we thinke,
                  
                  
                     And whiles we swimme secure, compell vs sinke.
                  
                  Mild calm'd fac't peace, exceeds blood-thirsting war.
                  
                     Warre is ordain'd for nothing else but peace:
                  
                  
                     And perfect peace is end of bloudie warre.
                  
                  Peace flourisheth where reason beareth sway.
                  
                     Peace still is honest, humane, and vpright:

                     Concord makes small things mightily encrease:
                  
                  
                     Where discord makes great things as fast decrease.
                  
                  True peace, is peace with vertue, warre with vice▪
                  
                  
                     In peace, for warre let vs so well prouide,
                  
                  
                     As in each state, no harme doe vs betide.
                  
                  Peace from a Tyrants mouth, is treacherie.
                  
                     Deare and vnprofitable is the peace,
                  
                  
                     That's purchast with expence of guiltlesse bloud.
                  
                  The weight of peace, is easie to be borne.
                  
                     They iustly doe deserue the sword of warre,
                  
                  
                     That wilfully withstand faire offered peace.
                  
                  To flye from peace, is seeking selfe-decay.
                  
                     Peace asketh no lesse wisdome to preserue is,
                  
                  
                     Than valour was bestowed in getting it.
                  
                  Peace still succeeds, what euer drifts withstand.
                  
                     That's more esteem'd, obtain'd by peace-full words,
                  
                  
                     Than any thing atchieu'd by violence.
                  
                  State-stabling peace, brings froward minds in fashion.

                     As desolation dwelles where discord is,
                     So where is concord, liues all happinesse.
                     As Laurell euer crownes the Conquerour,
                     So peace becommeth any Emperour.
                     As they that seeke their harme, deserue to haue it,
                     So they which flie from peace, should neuer feele it.
                     As warre cuts deepe, and maketh mightie wounds,
                     So peace like soueraigne balme doth cure them all.
                     As griefe is cognisance of falling states,
                     So peace is glorie of faire shining sway.

                  He is too foolish that mistrusts his friend.
                  In greatest need, a friend is best discern'd.
                  
                     We ought sometimes as well to reprehend,

                  True friendship maketh light all heauie harmes.
                  A friend in most distresse, will most assist.
                  
                     Who entertaineth many friends, doth loose

                  Men in their friendship, alwayes should be one.
                  A hard attempt to tempt a foe for aid.

                  Small is that friendship table-talke will cracke▪
                  
                  Requests twixt friends are counted as commaunds.

                  No man should loue himselfe more than his friend.

               Of Lust.
               
                  
                     Lust, is the minds disturber, purses foe:
                     The conscience wronger, and first step to woe.
                  
               
               
                  LVst oft is fill'd, but neuer satisfied.
                  Lasciuious lust the sences doth deceiue.
                  Where lust gets footing, shame doth soon ensue.
                  
                     Lust like a lanthorne sheweth through it selfe,
                  
                  
                     The poysoned venime hid within it selfe.
                  
                  Lust puts the most vnlawfull things in vre.
                  The Leachers tongue, is neuer void of guile.
                  Lust liues by spoile, like theeues that rob true men.
                  
                     Lust makes obliuion, beateth reason backe:

                     Most sweet it is, swift same to ouer-goe:
                  
                  
                     But vile, to liue in lusts blacke ouerthrow.
                  
                  
                     Where lust is law, it booteth not to plead.
                  Lust lacks no wings, when loue is fled away.
                  Blind is base lust, false colours to descrie.
                  
                     Iustes Owle-sight eyes are dazeled with the light,

                  Loue surfets not, lust like a glutton dies.
                  Loue is all truth, lust full of perjur'd lyes.
                  Lusts winter comes ere sommer halfe is done.
                  
                     While lust is in his pride, no exclamation

                  Lust being Lord, there is no trust in kings.
                  Leud lust is endlesse, pleasure hath no bounds.
                  As corne o're-growes by weeds, so feare by lust.
                  
                     All faire humanitie abhorres the deed,

                  Faire loue, foule lust, are deadly enemies.
                  Lust blowes the fire when temperance is thawed.
                  
                     Faire day discouers lustes obscurest wayes,

                  The loue of lust is losse vnto our health.
                  Lust led with enuie, dreads no deadly sinne.
                  Sower is the case that from lusts root doth spring.

                  It is great vertue to abstaine from lust.
                  Who followes lust, can neuer come to loue.
                  Lust alwaies seekes the ruine of chaste loue.

                  Lust is a pleasure bought with after paine.

                  Lust is in age most loathsome, vile in youth.
                  Lust makes vs couet things beyond our power.
                  Lust cuts off life before the dated time.

                     Such is the nature still of haughtie pride,
                  
                  
                     Than others praise, can nothing worse abide.
                  
                  In-sight illustrates, outward brauerie blinds.
                  Shame followes pride, as doth the bodies shade.
                  Wit oft-times wrackes, by selfe-conceit of pride.
                  
                     Though pride leads on, yet shame doth wait behind,
                  
                  
                     And shame for pride by iustice is assign'd.
                  
                  Beautie breeds pride, pride bringeth forth disdaine.
                  Vertue is plac'd, where pride may not presume.
                  The plague of pride presumption did begin.
                  
                     Nothing there is that heauen can worse abide,

                  Trust not to choise of proud confederates.
                  High-builded castles ouer-looke low lands.
                  Enuie is auncient'st sinne, but pride is greatest.
                  
                     Proud thoughts, that greatest matters take in hand,
                  
                  
                     Falls soonest, where they safest thinke to stand.
                  
                  Sorrow ne're followes him that flyes from pride.
                  Where least desert is, alwaies pride is most.
                  Prides lowest step is blood, Enuie the highest.
                  
                     Pride bathes in teares of poore submission,
                  
                  
                     And makes his soule the purple he puts on.
                  
                  A proud mans glory, soone begets defame.
                  A rich man hardly can be free from pride.

                     And Idlenes, the guide to euery ill.
                  
               
               
                  SLoth dulles the wit, and doth corrupt our strength.
                  Sloth both corrupts, and chokes the vitall powers.
                  Idlenes is a death in life esteem'd.
                  Long slumbers are for idle persons meet.
                  
                     The idle luske, that no way is enclin'd,
                  
                  
                     Walkes as one dead among the liuing kind.
                  
                  Ease is the mothet of dissention.
                  Who growes too negligent, too soone repents.
                  Humours, by much excesse of ease are bred.
                  All idle workes, are but the workes of lyes.
                  
                     All idle houres are Calenders of ruth,
                  
                  
                     And time ill spent is preiudice to youth.
                  
                  Idlenesse causeth errour and ignorance.
                  Through idlenes, kingdoms haue ben destroi'd.
                  Idlenes is the root of desperation.
                  The idle mind is apt to all vncleannesse.
                  
                     In height of weale who hath a slothfull heart,
                  
                  
                     Repents too late his ouer-foolish part.
                  
                  
                     Sloth blunts conceit, but studie sharpens it.
                  Prosperitie alwaies ingendreth sloth.
                  The slothfull man in his owne want doth sleepe.
                  Sloth hinders thrift, and much displea

                  Sloth is a feare of labour to ensue.

                     As mosse growes on those stones which are not stirr'd,
                     So sloth defiles the soule, not well employed.
                     As standing waters venemous wormes ingender,
                     So idle braines beget vnholy thoughts.
                     As pooles freeze sooner than the running streames,
                     So idle men speed worse than those that worke.
                     As sitters sooner sleepe than they that walke,
                     So sinne tempts sooner sloth, than diligence.

                     Men die, and humane kind doth passe away,
                  
                  
                     But griefe (that mak

                  Ioy still ascends, but sorrow sings below.
                  Men may lament, but neuer disanull.
                  Sorrow still seazeth on a grieued heart.
                  
                     Things of small moment we can scarsely hold,
                  
                  
                     But griefes that touch the heart, are hardly told.
                  
                  They easily grieue, that cannot choose but moane.
                  
                     Sorrow concludes not when it seemeth done.
                  Conceit deriues from some fore-father griefe.
                  
                     Conceiued griefe reboundeth where it falls:
                  
                  
                     Not with the emptie hollownesse, but weight.
                  
                  Things past redresse should be as free from care.
                  It is no losse to be exempt from care.
                  Against a chaunge, woe is o're-run with woe.
                  
                     Woe with the heauier weight doth alwaies sit,

                  Sorrow is mortall enemie to health.
                  Griefe wanteth words to vtter what it would.

                  Griefes best redresse, is the best sufferance.
                  Griefe finds some ease by him that beareth like.

                  Distresse likes dumps, when time is kept with teares.
                  Woe is most tedious when her words are briefe.
                  Though woe be heauie, yet it seldome sleepes.
                  
                     Kind fellowship in woe, doth woe asswage,

                  Weepe ne're so long, yet griefe must haue an end.
                  Of sorrow, comes but fancies and fond dreames.
                  
                     True sorrow then is feelingly suffis'd,

                  On greatest charge, the greatest care attends.
                  Dombe is the message of a hidden griefe.
                  
                     Sorrow breakes seasons, and reposing houres:
                  
                  
                     Makes the night morning, and the noon-tyde night.
                  
                  Our inward cares are most pent in with griefe.
                  Sad cares, mens eyes doth alwayes open keepe.

                     To be bemoand of such as wofull are.
                  
                  Wounds helpe not wounds, nor griefe ease grieuous deeds.
                  Excesse of sorrow listneth no reliefe.
                  Passions encreasing, multiply complaints.

                     It kills his heart, but comforts not at all.
                  
                  No griefe like to the bondage of the mind.
                  No outward vtterance can commaund conceit.

                     As tendrest wood is most annoyed of wormes,
                     So feeblest minds doth sorrow most afflict.

                  The highest state awarrants not mishaps.
                  Vnfortunate are some men that be wise.
                  
                     Happy he liues that tasteth no mischaunce.
                  
                     Oft times we see amidst the greatest cares,
                  
                  
                     Some ill successe doth slip in vnawares.
                  
                  No wit nor wealth preuailes against mischaunce.
                  If ill approch vs, onely that is ours.
                  Of greatest ill, a greater good may spring.
                  
                     The man that still amidst misfortunes stands,
                  
                  
                     Is sorrowes slaue, and bound in lasting bands.
                  
                  Neuer stayes tickle fortune in one state.
                  The basest meanes, oft highest fortune brings.
                  Well may he swimme, held vp by fortunes hand.

                     When all our fortunes runne against the byas.
                  
                  Fortune hurts not where she is held despis'd.
                  The fleece of fortune striues to haue the fell,
                  Who keepes his fortunes wisely, needs no more.
                  
                     They fall, which trust to fortunes fickle wheele:
                  
                  
                     But stayed by vertue, men shall neuer reele.
                  
                  Time goes by turnes, and chances change by course.
                  A tragicke note best fits a tragicke chaunce.
                  By fortunes smiles ensues the greatest falls.

                  Fortune may raise againe a downe-cast foe.
                  The cards once dealt, it boots not aske, why so?
                  Loue throwes them downe, whom fortune raised vp.
                  
                     Riches are nothing else but fortunes gifts,

                  Mariners sound at first for feare of rockes.
                  Fortune assaults, but hurts no constant mind.
                  Physicall drugs helpe not sinister chaunce.
                  
                     It's seldome seene in any high estate,
                  
                  
                     Father and sonne like good, like fortunate.
                  
                  Fortunes fierce frownes, are oft times princes haps.
                  
                     Fortunes being equall, are loues fauorites.
                  Where Fortune fauours much, she flatters more.
                  
                     Nothing is ours that we by hap may loose:
                  
                  
                     What nearest seemes, is furthest off in woes.
                  
                  Birth many times by fortune is abas'd.
                  Fortune in sleepers nets poures all her pride.
                  To painfull persons fortune is ingrate.
                  
                     When Fortune doth most sweetly seeme to smile,
                  
                  
                     Then soone she frownes, she laughes but little while.
                  
                  Few reape the sweete, that taste not of the sower.
                  Whome fortune scornes, the common people hate.
                  
                     Trust not to Fortune when she seemes to smile,
                  
                  
                     For then she doth intend the greatest guile.
                  
                  Fortune is tear'md a bog or dauncing mire.
                  Fortune, though fickle, sometime is a friend.
                  Fortune helps hardie men, but scorneth cowards.
                  
                     Long-passed cares renew againe their course,
                  
                  
                     When fatall chaunce doth chaunge from bad to worse.
                  
                  Fortune can take our goods, but not our vertues.
                  Fortune is first and last, that ruines states.
                  Fortune oft brings vs to misfortunes gate.

                     For fooles and dolts, and men of base condition.
                  
                  While worthiest fall, fortune doth worth-lesse raise.
                  Fortune best shewes her-selfe in women kind.
                  Fortune doth glorie in her chaunging mood.
                  
                     While grasse doth grow, the labouring Steed may starue,
                  
                  
                     For fortune seld each wishers turne doth serue.
                  
                  On vertuous actions fortune hath no power.
                  Fortune can neuer hurt a steadfast mind.
                  Who farthest seemes, is to misfortune nighest.

                  Death is the finall end of all desires.

                  WOrds are but wind, they bid, but doe not buy.
                  The greatest words, oft times haue weakest deeds.
                  
                     Deepe sounds make lesser noise than shallow foords:

                     Thoughts are the flowring blossoms of the mind,
                     And words, the daily fruits of our desires.

                  Thoughts are but dreames, till their effects be tryed.
                  Vnstained thoughts doe seldome dreame of ill.
                  A fault vnknowne, is as a thought vnacted.

                  The thoughts of men are fed with expectations.
                  All wishing thoughts sprout forth by quicke desire.
                  Citties doe bastardize the brauest thoughts.
                  It's very hard, imprisoned thoughts to bale.

                  All wicked thoughts haue still a wicked end.
                  Sweet is the thought, where hope perswadeth hap.

                  All things are subiect to deaths tyrannie.
                  What thing soeuer liues, is sure to die.
                  All killing death, by Christ is kill'd him-selfe.
                  
                     Oh Sicknesse, thou art many times belyde,

                  The sharpest sting of death, hurts not but helpes.
                  Carrion corruption is the food of death.
                  The day of death, excels our day of birth.
                  
                     Oft times their gaines whome greatnesse fauoureth,
                  
                  
                     When chiefe preserr'd, stand as preferr'd to death.
                  
                  Raise vp no liuing blame against the dead.
                  A present death exceeds a lingring life.
                  Life leads to care, death to the scale of heauen.
                  
                     The dying man, whose eyes are sunke and dimme,
                  
                  
                     Thinkes euery passing bell rings out for him.
                  
                  To die in life, is but a liuing death.
                  Good death, not loftie life, is most renowme.
                  In countries cause to die, is noble death.
                  Death doth no time, no age, no reason measure.
               
               
                  Similies on the same subiect.
                  
                     AS the hearb Rew is bitter in our taste,
                     
                        
                           •
                        o deaths remembrance fearefull is to many.
                     As sleepe depriues the memorie of paines,
                     So sleepe of death ends all our wretchednes.
                     
                        As all small currents runne into the sea,
                     So all mens toiles are swallowed vp in death.
                     As borrowed money must be paid againe,
                     So what life owes, must be by death discharg'd.
                     As we are merrie at our childrens birth,
                     So should we not grieue vainly at their death.
                     As darknesse doth obscure the fairest day,
                     So death laies hold vpon the forward'st life.

                        HEctor said to his wife Andromache,
                     
                     Grieue not my death, all men are borne to die.

                     Said, Sleepe now yeelds me to his brother death.
                     
                        Pindarus sleeping on a young lads breast,
                     Neuer awaked, but in that sort dyed.
                     
                        Vespasian stood vp at the point of death,
                     And said, An Emperour should standing dye.
                     
                        Plato thankt Nature, that she let him liue,
                     In such a time, as taught him well to die.
                     
                        Thales will'd euery man amend his life,
                     Else he could haue no honour in his death.
                  
               
            
            
               
               The Conclusion.
               
                  THis worke, which cost no meane paines and labour, to reduce into this forme and method; is thus at the length happily concluded, & commended to the kind acceptation of all gentle and well-disposed minds. If some carping Sycophant (readier alway to cauill and find fault, than correct and amend) shall mislike of the course obserued in this booke, and imagine the heads not aptly or properly placed, (according as in his nice opinion perhaps hee would haue them:) let me thus plainely answere him, That they were neuer meant for the pleasing of his vaine appetite, and therefore hee hath more loue to

looke off, than be prying into matters aboue his capacitie. Onely to the iudiciall and affable iudgements of this age, both the paines and pleasure of this labour is published: not doubting, but they will measure it by the iust desert, and censure thereof as their owne kind natures haue euer beene accustomed.
               In this first Impression, are omitted the Sentences of Chaucer, Gower, Lidgate, and other auncient Poets, because it was not knowne how their forme would agree with these of ten syllables onely, and that sometimes they exceed the compasse herein obserued, hauing none but lineall and couplet sentences, aboue and beyond which course, the Gentleman who was the cause of this collection (taking therin no meane paines him-selfe, besides his friends labour) could not be perswaded, but determinately aimed at this obseruation. Neuerthelesse, if this may enioy but the fauour hee hopes it will, and the good intent thereof be no way misconstrued: at the next impression it shall be largely supplyed, with things that at this present

could not be obtained, both in respect of some vrgent occasion, beeing the hinderance thereof: as also because there wanted apt meanes to furnish further purpose then intended. All which, shall then be answered effectually, and any thing els may be thought auaileable to this worke, and the good liking of the wise.
