            The Argument of the booke intituled, A Reſolution of Religion, promiſed, and defended in this Epiſtle.
            THe Reſolution of Religion being deuided into two parts, entreateth in the first, of the abſolute Neceſſitie of a Diuine worſhip, againſt all Atheists, Epicures, Doubters, or Deniers thereof: proouing aſwell the moſt infallible certainty and preeminences of this ſupernaturall Reuerence, as the manifold groſſe abſurdities of that vnnaturall and prophane People. Secondly, it demonſtrateth againſt Iewes, Pagans, Mahumetanes, and all externall Enemies of Christ, that onely the Religion which he taught is true, and all others, blasphemous, and ouerwhelmed with manifest and intollerable errours. In the ſecond part it ſheweth by aboue an hundred vnanſwerable Arguments, againſt all Heretikes, and internall Aduerſaries, that among ſo many profeſſions of Christ, onely Catholike Romane Religion is true, and deliuered by him, and all others, eſpecially the Protestancie of England, not onely by all thoſe Reaſons, but by their owne grounds and proceedings, falſe and damnable.

               WHerefore that which ſo many priuate and publike writings affirme abroad, and at home, which euery man ſeeth and feeleth to be true, and thoſe principall Proteſtants recorded of their Diſciples, in the prime and flouriſhing time, the very zenith and higheſt of their exaltation, when the reformers of others ſhould haue giuen ſome example and ſhew of reformation in themſelues, I truſt it will not be offenſiue for me, a Catholike ſubiect of England, after ſo many yeeres of experienced encreaſe of their impieties, and in their withering and decaying age, euery thing with them growing worſe and worſe, to affirme to be true. Then (moſt Noble) as ordinary effects proceede from ordinary cauſes, ſo extraordinary and ſtraunge things (ſuch as this kinde of iniquitie, ſo wicked, ſo vniuerſall, and erroneous is) muſt haue ſome vnwonted cauſe, more than is vſuall in chriſtian men. I will not be ſo ſeuere a Sentencer againſt them, as their confederate Iohn Riuius is, to ſay, that they be Atheiſts, Epicures, and deniers of the ſoules immortalitie, and thereby thinking there is no religion in the worlde, no life after

death, no reward of vertue, or penalty for vice haue giuen themſelues ouer to all kinde of ſinne. Neither wil I enter to ſo bloody a iudgement in this place (reſeruing it to bee diſcuſſed heereafter) againſt theſe men,Conuoc. Lond.

But to reſerue theſe and ſuch arguments as may be inforced by that which is ſpoken, to their proper place, and proſecute my preſent intent; it is manifeſt by the Babilonical diuiſion, which is in the vnderſtanding of this people, that they haue forſaken the true faith, religion, and rule thereof, which can be but one; and by the groſſe impieties which haue taken ſo quiet poſſeſſion of their liues, that they are ſo far from al intereſt, either of reforming errors of the mind, or abuſes of life in others (by which in the beginning they claymed title to a new religion) that they haue beene the onely cauſe of ſo many infidelities, Atheiſmes, Epicuriſmes, Iudaiſmes, Mahumetiſmes, and other intollerable ſinnes, & offences which are daily by their owne confeſſion before, practized among them: for when and where the infallible rule and cenſure of ſupernaturall difficulties is denied, and euery man left to his owne priuate deduction, and deceiptfull iudgement, farre vnable to deſcipher ſupernaturall myſteries, what hope can be had of truth? what probabilitie of agreement? who wil be encoraged to ſeeke for veritie, where it is impoſſible to be found? If it were in naturall arts, and ſciences, which be connaturall, and proportionable

to humane capacitie, if there were ſo many opinions, diuers and contrary, as are among them in religion, ſo that before hee could follow any, hee muſt learne to confute all the reſt, what man would willingly profeſſe that art as true, though it were neuer ſo gainefull, if it were obtained, about learning whereof there is ſuch diſſention, that three hundred to one hee ſhould be deceiued? By that reaſon, in Arts, Alchimie of making gold is ordinarily refuſed, hauing brought ſo many to errour and beggery, by the vncertaintie thereof, although in it ſelfe it is woonderfull commodious. For matters of antiquitie, the diuerſity of opinions about the originall of the Brittans in this land, hath cauſed many to thinke there neuer was any Brute at all.Hierom. lib. de vir illuſtr. l raen. lib. 3 c. 3.

It is as manifeſt both by al Hiſtories and Monuments, that Saint Peter liued long and died at Rome, as that William of Normandy ſurnamed the Conquerour came into England, and ſubdued it, or as any ſuch antiquity can be; and yet bicauſe (as Proteſtants ſay) there is difference betweene Saint Hierome, Oroſius, and Faſciculus temporum, about the time of his comming thither, (although they agree with the reſt, that hee liued and died there) ſome Proteſtants are not afraide to affirme he was neuer at Rome. For a like cauſe, the whole Proteſtant Cleargie of England in their authorized Conuocation, deny the Bookes of Machabees, Iudith, and Tobias, to be canonicall ſcriptures. So it chanceth in Sciences, where controuerſie and multiplicity of opinions is. Then how much more true is it in things ſo eleuated aboue naturall vnderſtanding, as the myſteries

of religion be? What a palpable prouocation and allurement of delightfull atheiſme, epicuriſme, and infidelitie is it to carnall mindes, to ſee ſo many diuiſions, and no agreement? For can any one particular voluptuous man or other in iudgement thinke himſelfe wiſer than ſo many great companies and congregations as hee is moſt ſure are all deceiued? And if hee ſhoulde aduenture to beleeue, and be religious, as others doe, there is oddes, three hundred to one, he ſhall be brought into errour, becauſe he ſeeth ſo many religions erected & defended, againſt whatſoeuer he ſhall chuſe to followe, the pleaſures he ſhould forſake are certaine, ſenſible, and forcible to mooue affection; that which hee ſhould beleeue is moſt vncertaine, ineuident, and without motiue to be followed, as it is propoſed in theſe mens proceedings.Barnard.

by the promiſe of Chriſt, from falling into error, it is euident, that a thouſand to one he ſhall ſhalbe ſeduced & damned. Who then wil wonder if many infidels & atheiſts are entred among theſe men, when at the worſt their atheiſme, and that only in the end, can bring but to damnatiō; & in the meane time brings al pleaſures and delights; and their profeſſing of religion in ſuch vncertaine maner: firſt, moſt certainly depriueth of thoſe pleſures, & 1000. to one brings to the ſame damnation? Or who wil maruel if thoſe that be not come to this, perfection of policie, & nullifidianitie (as I truſt ther be but few, one being too much in a chriſtian nation) be far more careles, negligent, & vnduetifull in liuing well, then ſuch as doe liue in the vnitie of the whole Catholike worlde, wherein there neuer was, or is any diſagreement, or contradiction in matters of belieuing. For if (as I ſhewed before) a man might, would, or ſhould, in reaſon, doubt to giue aſſent to any religion, where there was ſo manifeſt and apparant daunger of a falſe election; if it be true in a ſpeculatiue conſent of faith, onelie exacting an agreement of the vnderſtanding, howe much more doubt and difficultie will bee made, for men of reaſon to aduenture ſo great paines and labours, as holy Scriptures preſcribe to be vſed for obtaining heauen, when by reaſon it is euident, before they begin, that a thouſand to one, al their labors will be loſt, and their indeuours rewarded with euer-during damnation in hell? Will any man now muſe if the ſong of Epicures is ſo often tuned, and ſo much impietie put in practiſe? If it were in the execution

of daily and ordinary affaires, no man woulde labour much for that, which ſo many affirme he could not get, but contrariwiſe, euery one in reaſon ſhould and would contend for principall preferrement and commodity, which all men graunt he might obtaine: hee that by conſent of all, hath vndeniable title to a kingdome, or meaner dignitie, will refuſe no aduenture to winne it; he, whome all, or moſt deny to haue ſuch intereſt, either will not at all, or faintly take it in hand, hauing little or no hope to bring his attempt to paſſe; euen ſo in theſe ſpirituall affaires. For although the Crowne and inheritaunce of heauen propoſed to Chriſtians, is incomparably more excellent, than ſuch terrene preferments; yet being a ſpirituall and ſupernaturall reward, and not ſo proportionate to the manner of humane knowledge, and affection in this life, (depending of ſence and imagination) as temporall aduauncements and pleaſures are, and being ſo vncertain, vnprobable, or rather vnpoſſible to be obtained, as theſe men make it, it can be no matter of admiration, that ſo much wickedneſſe doth rule, and ſo few aduenture ſo certaine and painefull a worke, for ſo vncertaine and doubtfull recompence.Lact firm. lib. 1, 2

               WHerefore (right Honourable) as it is ſo euident that it can not be denied, but ſuch troupes of errours and impieties haue embatteled themſelues in the camp of Proteſtants, and by ample reaſons may bee had in iuſt ſuſpition, that many doubters, or rather deniers (at leaſt in affection) of all Worſhip, as euer in like times haue beene, are entred in: So, ſeeing contraries are, and muſt be cured by contraries, and certaintie and true vnitie in religion is the onely remedy of ſuch intollerable and prophane abuſes, as haue proceeded from want thereof, I haue written a cōpleate confutation of all enemies to true reuerence, of what condition ſoeuer, Atheiſts, Epicures, and ſuch as be deniers of all worſhip; or externall infidells and aduerſaries of Chriſt, Pagans, Iews, Mahumetanes; or internall ennemies as the heretikes of all ages, eyther paſt, preſent, or to be heereafter, which I haue named, A Reſolution of Religion, becauſe therein, not onely all doubtes and difficulties, eyther pretended by any of thoſe misbeleeuers, or by any means to be imagined, or conceiued, are looſed and reſolued, but

euery article and queſtion of that moſt holy and approoued Religion, which I defend, is ſolued from all errours, and reſolued to the moſt aſſured and infallible word and reuelation of God, which by no poſſibilitie can either be deceiued in himſelfe, or be cauſe of errour vnto others. Whereby euery point and propoſition of religious duety will be prooued to be ſo certaine, that no infidell or falſe beleeuer can make it doubtfull. So certaine as Saint Chryſostome writeth,Chryſoſt. homi. 8 in ep. ad Rom. Augu. lib. 7. Confeſſ. c. 10. as any naturall demonſtration is; or to folow ſaint Augustines phraſe ſo vndoubted, that a man in iudgement ſhould ſooner doubt, whether himſelfe doth liue, than call any article of that faith into queſtion. So that, as nothing can be more holy, credible, and woorthy to be beleeued, then that doctrine which I am to teach; ſo nothing can be more irreligious obſtinacie, and wilfulneſſe, than to deny, and not embrace it: and as great madnes to follow any other falſe profeſſion, being as reſolutely proued, that they are all moſt vaine, falſe, erroneous, and reſolued to the lying ſpirite of the Diuell, and wicked deceiuers and ſeducers.

But a Religion founded vpon the moſt certaine and infallible worde and reuelation of God, expounded by thoſe vndeceiuable Rules before remembred, and that holy and euer-during ſociety and Church of Chriſt, for which he gaue himſelfe, and ordained Religion; where ſo much virtue is practiſed, ſuch obedience, chaſtitie, pouertie, and contempt of all impediments of heauen is vowed, and profeſſed, which ſocietie, if it might erre, no preſeruance of true Religion is to be hoped: for where none ſhoulde truely beleeue, all ſhould be in errour.

Not a Religion, that contrarie to the name, nature, and office of true Religion, ſeparateth man from his God and Creator, by ſo many ſinnes and iniquities, and yet hath no grace no Sacrament for men of reaſon and actuall offences, no meanes or preſeruatiue to preuent them, no helpe or remedy to redeeme them; but ſuffereth man to lie loaden vnder ſo mighty a maſſe of impieties, and to be drowned in hell (for that inſtrument of their iuſtifying faith can be no benefit to them,Part 2.

For the ſtate of all, vntil they came to ſuch diſcretion and iudgement, as may be cauſe of ſinne, the Sacrament of Baptiſme, both taking originall offence away, and arming the ſoule againſt new and actual infection. To confirme the former grace of that tender age, and enable vs againſt ſo many temptations and perſecutions as Chriſtians haue, the Sacrament of Confirmation. To feede and foſter all eſtates in the whole courſe and circuite of this life, the foode of diuine Euchariſt, and Sacrament of the moſt holy body and blood of Chriſt: and (ſeeing all are ſubiect vnto ſinne) the Sacrament of Penaunce, for the cure and comfort of all offenders. And becauſe the agonies and temptations at the time of death be vrgent moſt againſt vs; the Sacrament of Annointing, or extreame vnction, to remooue the relickes of ſinne, and giue ſtrength in that extremitie, And for the particular helpes and aſſiſtance of particular ſtates, particular Sacraments; the Sacrament of Orders to dignifie the

calling of Clergy men, and make them worthie and fit inſtruments to performe ſo many holy & ſupernaturall functions, as are belonging to that preeminence. And laſtly, for the conſolation and defence of married people, ſuch as encomber themſelues with the cares of the world, and practical life, the Sacrament of Matrimony, giuing grace and ſtrength againſt the difficulties and cares of that condition. No ſtate, no ſexe, no age, no time, no place, order, or degree among men is left vnprouided of ſpirituall comforte, and protection. Not a Religion, whoſe grounds and principles ouerthrowe all chriſtian and true Religion, where God is made author of all ſinnes, and thereby worthy no Religion, where the deciſion of ſpirituall doubtes appertaine to temporall and vnlearned Princes, men,Reſolut. part 2. argum. 5.6. ſtat 1 Elizab. 13.

For who can certainely beleeue that, which moſt certainely is vncertaine or falſe? or who can either praiſe or diſcommend, that which is doone whether the doer wil or no? How can ſuch actions be rewarded or puniſhed? How can that ſoule be immortall,

and performe religion, which ſhould want free and reaſonable operations, the arguments and pledges of immortality? But I defend a religion ſo meaſured, as before, that by no poſſibilitie any Decree can be vntrue, a Religion that ſo concordeth the eternall praeſcience and predeſtination of God, with the temporall cooperation of man, that it both leaueth the firſt infallible, and yet prooueth the temporall action, appetite, delight or conſent to any things, to be voluntary, free, and in the power of man, to be effected or omitted, praiſed or diſcommended, rewarded or puniſhed, as the nature thereof deſerueth. Not that Religion which hath raiſed ſuch diſſentions, that it hath taken all vnitie and communion of Saints away, diuided the millitant and triumphant Church, and diſhonored both, depriuing Angells and glorified ſoules of that honor their excellencie and dignitie with God requireth, men in earth, the militant church of that helpe and aſſiſtance it needeth, and alwayes had from them, as inferiour cauſes from ſuperiour, all pitty and compaſſion of thoſe that liue and be in ſtate of merite, from the patient Church of the faithfull departed, and ſpoyled them of that reliefe they euer receiued of thoſe that liue, and made ſuch hauoke and confuſion euen among the liuing, that no man regardeth other, euery one almoſt of a different and diuided minde from the reſt in theſe things, and neuer at concord with himſelfe, but vppon euery new conceipt differing from his former aſſertion, in continuall combate and controuerſie with his owne will and vnderſtanding; and ſo no

communion and participation one with an other, no care of offence, and iniuries, no minde of ſatisfaction for wrongs and iniuſtices, no cō
                  bination of comembers, no penance, no reſtraint from ſinne, where the paſſion of Chriſt hath bin ſo long vaunted and triumphed of, that except in moſt ſacrilegious and blaſphemous ſwearing by the inſtruments of our redemption, no memorie at all thereof is left; no ſigne or token to put vs in minde, no image or repreſentation, no commemoratiue ſacrifice, or ſignification of ſo many paines, miſeries, and myſteries, as our Sauiour indured and wrought for our redemption; where no order or hierarchicall ſubordination, no conſecration, or diſtinction of callings and vocations is,Statut. Elizab. except the letters patents of a temporall Prince can giue that to others, which is not, & cannot be in the giuer. But that Religion, which as it is vnited, and one in it ſelfe, in earth conſiſteth of a moſt perfect hierarchicall regiment, of Pope, Patriarkes, Archbiſhops, Biſhops, Prieſts, Deacons, Subdeacons, Acolathiſts, Exorciſts, Lectors, and other Vnder-officers, euery one in his roome and dignitie, and the meaneſt of all, by calling and conſecration, of greater honour than any miniſteriall preferment among Proteſtants, being no reall thing, but an ens rationis, an Idoll of the minde, as the making of Purſuvants, Apparators, and ſuch Officers appoynted by others; where our POPE which is ſo odious in England, is ſo ample in iuriſdiction in all the worlde, that no temporall Prince chriſtian or infidell, no ruler or profeſſor of regiment in eccleſiaſticall and ſpirituall cauſes, at

this time; or any heeretofore, either is, or was' by many degrees poſſeſſed of ſo large a regimēt· And our priuate Prieſts, namely, the moſt reuerend and learned Fathers of the Societie of IESVS, (ſo contemptible in our country,) are honoured of the greateſt Princes of the world, & by their preachings & paines haue added ſo many kingdomes both to the ſpirituall regiment of Chriſt, and temporall gouernement of Catholike kings. Our Catholike kings be moſt mightie, and they which regarde vs moſt, the moſt rich, puiſſant, and greateſt Princes of the worlde. Our religion religeth and bindeth together, (as the name importeth) not onely kingdomes and menne in earth, but God, and his Catholike ſeruants, the triumphant, militant, and patient Church; no duety is omitted, no compaſſion or pitty wanting: where the myſterie of our redeeming is ſo eſteemed and remembred, that no feſtiuitie, no office or parte of diuine ſeruice is celebrated in the yeere, but repreſenteth vnto vs one benefite or other, no ceremony is vſed in the holy ſacrifice of Maſſe, no action of the Prieſt, no ornament or attire hee weareth, no benediction hee giueth, no ſigne of the Croſſe hee maketh, but hath his religious ſignification, and preacheth vnto vs; his introite to the Altare, his actions there, his returne from thence, the very veſtments wherewith he is adorned, the putting of them on, the wearing of them in that celebration, his putting them off, his Amice, Albe, Girdle, Manciple, Stoale, Veſtiment, and all hee vſeth, ſpeak nothing but Chriſt crucified, the maner of his oblation, the cloth wherewith he was

blindfolded, the white garment putte on by Herode, the cordes and whippe wherewith hee was bound and ſcourged, the purple veſtment wherwith he was deluded, and that myſticall and moſt holy ſacrifice, his bloody and cruental oblation vppon the Croſſe; no action, geſture, prayer, or the leaſt ceremony, either in word or deede, ſilence, or otherwiſe, but bringeth a religious leſſon and meaning, and tendeth to inſtruction; no benefite that Chriſt beſtowed vppon man, from the firſt inſtant of his conception, left vnremembred, but one time or other celebrated. Not that Religion which denieth al things, and properties of Religion, as their opinions all negatiue doe witnes, that hath taken away and conuerted from common and ſpirituall religious vſes, to priuate and temporall pleaſures and preferments, all monuments, and foundations of deuotion, and places of religious exerciſe, leauing, and vſing nothing neceſſary to mans ſaluation. But that Religion whoſe opinions againſt theſe men, are all affirmatiue, profeſſing deuotion, and one acte of pietie or other; that hath founded Churches, Schooles, Colledges, Monaſteries and places, where Chriſtian learning euer was, or is exerciſed at this day: that obſerueth all things, and wanteth, or omitteth nothing belonging,Reſolut.

               WHerefore, right Honorable, although the endes and offices of a religious & ſpirituall common wealth be diſtinct and diuerſe, from thoſe of a temporall and ciuil gouernment, wherein you are ſupreame Lieutenants vnder our gratious Princeſſe; and in that reſpect, matters handled in the one, doe not ſo properly appertaine to the iudgement and redres of thoſe, which rule in the other, but are to bee decided and reformed by the gouernours of that profeſſion, to which they are belonging; yet as the glory of the firſt cannot commonly bee maintained, without the fauour of the ſecond, ſo this cannot rightly bee ruled without direction from the former, for where there is no greater or more forcible motiue to keepe in order, but feare of temporall correction, (for no temporall magiſtrate can puniſh eternally or after death) which is onely a bridle againſt publike and notorious offences, which may be denounced and proued by witnes, as euery ciuill magiſtrate muſt proceed, ſecundum allegata & probata, as matters are, and can be alledged, and proued, and that which cannot ſo be determined, can neither be puniſhed or condemned; but in ſecret men may

practiſe all impietie without controlement, if no Religion and dread of a diuine maieſtie by his infinit wiſedome knowing, & by his immutable iuſtice puniſhing ſecret ſinnes, were to keepe in awe. Therefore, as this cauſe I haue in hand is the moſt honorable of all, that can be entreated, ſo I am bolde to offer this introductory Epiſtle and defence thereof, to your honours, the moſt honourable and noble conſiſtory of our nation; and as it is moſt neceſſary to be conſidered, in regard of duty to God and man, which it teacheth, ſo I tender it to you, the ſupreame Deputies of our gratious Soueraigne, whoſe chiefe care and ſolicitude muſt be, in taking order for ſuch cauſes; becauſe you are Chriſtian magiſtrates, and take vpon you the defence of the lawe of Chriſt, which I here maintaine; becauſe you are ſworne Councellers to aſſiſt our Princeſſe, whoſe chiefe ſtile and title is granted to hir father King Henry the eight, by Pope Leo the tenth, (defendor of the faith) for defending the Catholike Romane Religion againſt Luther,

Pardon noble Patrons, peremptorily without al exception I vndertake, to proue directly, not only by al other arguments, but by the Parliament laws & proceedings of Qu. Elizab. that the Religion thoſe men profes as confirmed by thē, is falſe, euen by them, & that we defend, to be true, euen by thoſe groundes and decrees.

God, that there is an externall Prieſthoode and ſacrifice in the church of Chriſt, that wee are not iuſtified by an imputatiue iuſtice, but grace and iuſtice are inherent and internal things, that the Sacraments of Chriſt giue grace, that there be ſeauen Sacraments in number, Baptiſme, Confirmation, Eucharist, Penance, Extreame vnction, Orders, and Matrimonie, and all other matters of moment in controuerſie betweene them and vs. Which when I haue performed, no obiection can be made againſt the allowance of my petition. And becauſe I was ſometimes demaunded of your predeceſſours in that place, beeing conuented before them for profeſſing this Religion, I ſtill defend, what reaſon ſhould mooue me, then very yong in yeares, borne of parents conformable to the time, in, and vnder the Proteſtant regiment of Queene Elizabeth, brought vp in that Vniuerſitie and other places which were alwayes leaſt fauouring of that beliefe (all which things were either knowne before, or acknowledged by me to that aſſembly) to be of a different and contrary opinion, when if I would haue beene of the ſame profeſſion, I might haue beene regarded as others of my condition: to whome (as I hope) my anſwere then was ſufficient for my owne priuate ſo dooing. So nowe laſtly, for that cauſe, I humbly intreate licence, to direct theſe reaſons, which I haue gathered in that queſtion, both for the excuſe of my ſelfe, and others, to your Honours, their ſucceſſours in that court of iudgement, although farre more mercifull moderators in ſuch cauſes. And that I may giue full aſſurance, I doe it not to vpbraid

I will teach nothing contrary to her princely dignitie and prerogatiues, nothing repugnant to her owne truely interpreted proceedings. I will defend the liues, religion, fame and memory of all her famous and noble chriſtian progenitours, Kings and Queenes of

                  England, many of them while they liued honourable in earth, and now glorious in Heauen, whome her wicked Proteſtant miniſters muſt needes condemne all to hell and damnation, if they will leaue any little hope for themſelues to be ſaued, for one heauen can not poſſeſſe them both: The lawe of God commaundeth me, the lawe of nature enforceth me, humanitie compelleth, gratitude obligeth, duety and reuerence to my Queene Elizabeth their heire and ſucceſſor, dooth neceſſitate me, in this extremitie, and deſperate danger of their eternall noble fame & memory, to releeue them that bee dead, and without reliefe of thoſe, by whome they ſhould be both relieued and reuerenced in that behalf; and not permit them for want of iuſt defence to be condemned of men in earth, that are ſo happily tranſlated from corruptible to euer-during kingdomes. They were ſuch as the condition of honorable Kings requireth, Hiſtorians write it, their yet liuing lawes, and other monuments doe prooue it, it cannot be imputed folly to him that ſhall defend them.

                  Foxe and others acknowledge many of them to be glorious Saints in heauen, whither falſe Religion could not bring thē. And to giue example; it is written, not onely by Engliſh, both Catholike and Proteſtant, but forraine Hiſtorians, that king Aelfred builded the monaſtery of monkes in Ethelingsey, and that of nunnes in Shaftesbury, he founded the vniuerſitie of Oxford, hee tranſlated the lawes into our Engliſh tongue, and diuerſe other profitable Bookes, for the inſtruction of his ſubiects; hee diuided the foure and twenty houres of the day and night into three equall partes, eight houres he ſpent in writing, reading, and praying; eight houres in ſleepe, and other bodily prouiſion; and the other eight houres, in hearing and diſpatching the cauſes and complaintes of his ſubiectes. Such was the exerciſe of Kings in thoſe catholike times, as all Hiſtorians and Regiſters are witneſſe,Fox tom. 1. mon. fol. 216. in leg. ſ. Edward.

               COncerning you (my honorable Patrons) that wiſedome and prudence which hath exalted you to that tipe of dignitie, dooth tell you, that you are not wiſer in theſe cauſes, than thouſands of ſo wiſe, learned, vertuous, and honourable predeceſſors in that place, councellors to thoſe holy kings; ſuppoſe you might contend in politike gouernment with many, or moſt that went before you, let it be, ſome might be admitted fellowes in armes with ſo many martiall and victorious men, becauſe in ſuch caſes you haue beene experienced; yet to that which is moſt, or onely materiall in this queſtion, and controuerſie of learning, religion, and diuinitie, you are too wiſe to make ſo vnequall a compariſon, to ballance your ſelues, vntrained and vnskilfull in ſuch faculties, with ſo many Saints, moſt holy, learned, and profeſſed Diuines, Biſhoppes, and others, famous in the whole chriſtian world: ſuch as great numbers of the councellors of thoſe Princes were. Therefore, ſeeing it is the ſame vertue of prudence which teacheth and directeth what to doe, and admoniſheth what we are not able to performe, it muſt needs put you in minde, of the place you poſſeſſe, the charge you haue vndertaken, promiſe and fidelitie you haue giuen: and I remaine aſſured the pietie, mercie, iuſtice, and heroical munificence, which be the vndiuided companions of that virtue, & the naturall gratitude you owe to ſo many

deſcents of your noble predeceſſors, benefactors and moſt zealous profeſſours of the religion I defend, will both conquer your wittes, and mooue your willes. As I haue prooued of the Kings of England in all former times, thoſe that were our greateſt friends, ſtill enioy the greateſt honor, both in heauen and earth, thoſe that frinded vs leaſt, haue the leaſt intereſt therein; and thoſe which were our enemies, heauen & earth are ſtill at enmitie and variance with them, ſo it was with your predeceſſours in that place, and the aunceſtors of our whole nobilitie: the examples are too many to be cited, if any man deſireth the view, he may haue it in the catalogue of our vnfortunate Nobles: and for Proteſtant councellors, let him call to minde,ſtowe hiſtor. in H. 8. in Tho. lor

Who in the time of her Maieſtie that is, ſo violent an enemy againſt vs as Robert earle of Leicester, yet the profeſsors of that faith doe liue, and he at the very time when hee hadde deſigned the moſt bloudy perſecution againſt vs, miſerably died, terrified with monſtrous viſions of diuels,

and now his name is not aliue. Sir Francis Walſingham his deere friend, was the maſt cruel aduerſarie, for his degree, which this time hath maintained againſt vs; yet his miſerable death, his deſpairing wordes, Lay me aſide, and let me be forgotten, the illuſions hee had at the ſame time, and the filthy ſtinke and corruption of his body, wanting all funerall pompe, baſely buried in the night, will be an eternall infamy againſt him. I coulde eaſily exemplifie in others, both of the peaceable and martiall condition; but I will not be offenſiue to any of their families; theſe which I haue recounted haue left few heires, either of honour, or their names behinde them. Wherefore, moſt honourable Patrons, and you the reſt of the wiſe and noble gentry of England, Honor is the creſt of your endowments, Glorie is that you deſire, true honor and glory are onely, or chiefly belonging to that honorable ſtate which I defend: this glory is truely in him that is religious, hee is honoured heere of God by grace, and in heauen by glory: other honors be rather in men that honour, than in them that be honoured. And yet if your immortall appetites muſt needes poſſeſſe theſe mortall honors, there is none you now enioy, none you can deſire, which euer any of our Nation had, but was deriued from the gifts, donations, and bounties of our Catholike Popes, and Princes, to your aunceſtors and predeceſſors, and ſo to you by inheritance from the one, and ſucceſsion from the other. It was neuer hitherto accompted diſhonourable to any, to be profeſſor of that religion, which made him glorious. There haue beene

And becauſe I haue ſpoken of marriage;Marriages of Prieſts and Miniſters how much againſt a common-wealth. I with the indifferent Reader to conſider, whether the marriages of Prieſts and miniſters conſiſt with a common wealth or no: let him but looke into this one article, and he ſhall perceiue, that euen by the nature of the thing it ſelfe, ſo many wants, miſeries, diſtreſſes, and hungers as haue beene ſince, in this kingdome, and other flouds of daungers to a ciuill regiment, haue flowed from that fountaine.Graft. hiſt. an. 15. H. 5. Cambd. in Britan. The ancient number of pariſhes in England (euery one hauing at the leaſt one Prieſt, or Miniſter) haue beene accompted

forty thouſand; (though Camden and later Writers muſter a meaner reckning) beſides Biſhoprikes, Deaneries, Archdeaneries, Prebendaries, pety Canonries, and almoſt as many Chappels more, many of them hauing their particular miniſters, and diuerſe richer Proteſtant parſons their ſubcurates: and among all theſe it is a diſhonour at this day, for a man to be vnmarried. Then to make ſome coniecture in this caſe, becauſe a certainety can not be ſurueyed, lette vs compare this new married broode ſo giuen to generation, to the firſt inhabitants of countries, which of a farre fewer number, in proceſſe of time haue growen to ſo great and populous Nations; and becauſe the encreaſe of the people of Iſrael in Aegypt is moſt exactly aboue all others remembred, and regiſtred in holy Scriptures, which theſe men receiue, I will take an example from them, and yet to the Proteſtant aduantage; for the Iſraelites in Aegypt were perſecuted, and their children put to death, when contrariwiſe the generation of Miniſters in England hath flouriſhed, and beene defended. The number of the Iſraelites, men, women, and children,Gen. 46. acts 7. entring into Aegypt, were onely 70. as is written in Geneſis, or 75. as it is expounded of ſaint Stephen: if the firſt ſuruey of Engliſh pariſhes, and miniſters is admitted, although we alow many of them to haue liued, and vnmarried, yet numbring their wiues, which by chaſtitie in catholike times alſo were vnmarried; it is probable, that for euery maried Iſraelite, there were more than two thouſand married miniſters:Gen. 46, 47. for the grand-children of Iacob were not

married at that time: and if wee admit the leaſt ſuruey of thirteene thouſand, fifteene thouſand, or ſixteene thouſand pariſhes, yet for euery married Iſraelite, there was a thouſand married miniſters. Within the ſpace of foure hundred yeeres, the number of Iſraelites, from the age of one and twenty yeeres vpward, beſides many more thouſands of women, children, and young people, and the whole tribe of Leui, one of the twelue which was not nūbred in this account,Numer. cap. 1. the number of ſuch men amounted vnto ſix hundred thouſands, three thouſands, fiue hundred, and fiftie. Now let my Proteſtant Arithmetitians make a calculation of the Miniſters ofſpring; if wee take my leaſt account, if their religion ſhould laſt foure hundred yeeres, which is but ſo long as the true Church of Iſraelites liued almoſt pilgrims or captiues: yet a true Religion muſt be ſuch that it carry no deſtruction to commonwealths, though it laſt for euer, as the worſhip of Chriſt was inſtituted to doe then by my meaneſt reckoning, the number of men encreaſed in that time, wil be 603550000, ſix hundred thouſands of thouſands, three thouſand thouſands, fiue hundred thouſands, and fiftie thouſands, which is a greater number to bee added in our nation, then many Englands are able to maintaine, though we neither reckon woman nor childe. What then will the apparell and other expences of this generation be to a little country? yet I haue not coūted how many ſince Proteſtant Religion, haue multiplied in this order, which before liued in monaſteries and religious houſes, in chaſte and ſingle life, by common

iudgement, little, or not inferiour to the former multitude; which as it doubleth, the number of people encreaſed, ſo it doubleth the miſeries and perplexities of this kingdome. Such chargeable, bloody, and continued warres as England in this time hath had in Fraunce, Flaunders, and other places, both at ſea and land, are neither eaſie, nor ſecure to be maintained: And to ordaine or permitte multiplication of men to ſuch endes, to vtter them by ſlaughter, is wholy Turkiſh, and more like to Canaballs, than to Chriſtians. And yet, if they had not beene, to preuent ſo many marriages, and kill ſo many thouſands of men, how could this nation haue prouided for ſo many?Proteſtants doctrine and practiſe of Neglect, of Abſtinence, and Faſting in England, how preiudiciall to a common wealth. or how wil it deale hereafter, when the preſent inhabitants haue taſted ſo many wants? Lette vs make an other triall, what domage the taking away, or neglect of faſting and abſtinence in this religion hath broght to our common wealth. In Catholicke times, beſides ſo many dayes of abſtinence, whereby many thouſands of fiſhers were maintained, and much cattell and fleſh preſerued, there were obſerued aboue an hundred faſting dayes, with onely one meale in the day, if wee account the ſeuerall dayes of Lent, Fridayes, Ember dayes, Vigils, and euens of Saints, that were faſted; the number of the eaters then were fewer by much, as is reckoned by miniſters marriages, the diet was not ſo delitious, as Proteſtancie teacheth; then let vs giue all aduantage to Proteſtants in this commiſſion of enquirie, and ſuppoſe contrary to all iudgements, that there be but twelue thouſand pariſhes in England: let vs allowe that

there be onely in euery pariſh one with another, but an hundred perſons, menne and women, which were wont to faſt, though this number is much too little: let vs further imagine, that the expences of euery ones ſupper would onelie be the value of one penny, which is no deare ordinarie; yet by this fauourable reckoning, euery perſon in theſe hundred dayes, ſpareth one hundred pence, which is tenne ſhillings, and the hūdred perſons of euery pariſh one hundred times ten ſhillings, which is fiftie pounds; which together amounteth yeerely to ſixe hundred thouſands of poundes, beſides the conſumption of ſo much victualles, originall of ſo many wants: and yet it hath beene credibly reported, that of late yeeres vppon generall muſters in England, the muſter bookes haue amounted vnto thirtie hundred thouſands of able men, to which if wee adde ſo many women, making the number of threeſcore hundred thouſands, the ſumme will be fiue times ſo much, that is, thirty hundred thouſand poundes by the yeere, and to make a better eſteeme of the Miniſters progeny in expences; lette vs ſuppoſe, that in ſo many yeeres, they haue only amounted vnto one hundred thouſand of people; and that euery perſon of that increaſed tribe, ſpendeth but three pence in the day, peny halfepeny a meale; and to help this reckoning, let vs forgiue their apparell, and all other coſts for nothing, which is no vnequal dealing, yet their expences in the yeare do make 547500. fiue hundred thouſands, ſeuen and forty thouſands, and fiue hundreds of poundes; which is more than any victorious king of England

                  The Conformitie and Honor of catholike Religion to England, or any well ordered Commonwealth.Now let vs examine whether ſuch diſobedience in doctrine, or diſloyaltie of behauiour to commonwealths can be noted in Catholike religion; doe we not teach all duety vnto Princes and ſuperiours? what office, either of Prince, or inferiour Magiſtrate, what eſtate, or condition of men, clergy or laytie, what time, peace, or warres, or any thing that can be ſaid belonging vnto gouernement, is not moſt ſincerely deliuered by the Caſnyſts and Canoniſts of our religion,

and that conſenting to the regiment of the moſt famous and honourable Kingdomes of the worlde, gouerned by ſuch conſtitutions? Or is there any thing wee teach, different, or not agreeing to the auntient and moſt polliticke regiment of all chriſtian Nations? To beginne with that moſt reuerend function of Prieſthood, now treaſon by the proceedings of England (as ſome Proteſtants alleadge) what is there in that moſt ſacred Religious dignitie, that can bee guiltie of ſo great a crime? Treaſon is the greateſt offence that can be committed in England, and is called with vs, Crimen laeſae maiestatis, an offence that hurteth the Kings or Queenes Maieſtie;Stat. 25. Ed. 3. c. 2 5. Ric. 2. c. 5 ſtat. 1.

Alas what is in Prieſthoode now, that was not in former times, that it muſt be ſo accounted in the dayes of one Queene,Catal. Reg. Brit. & Angl. Fox to. mon. Stowe hiſt. which in the regiments of almoſt two hundred Chriſtian Kings within this kingdome, hath euer beene reputed both in parliament, and elſewhere, the moſt honorable calling, next to the prince, as the places of our great Prieſts or Archbiſhops are euidence. Nothing is, or can be changed in that ſacrament, howſoeuer the mindes and proceedings of Proteſtants doe change. The ſame prieſthoode which was giuen to Saint Peter, and the Apoſtles, the ſame which ſaint Augustine, and his aſſociates hadde

The ſame Sacrament vnchangeable, the ſame power of order, the ſame iuriſdiction; then except the ſtate of England bee not the ſame it was, Prieſthoode muſt be honorarable, & not trecherous. There is not any poynt of ciuill regiment in that ſacrament, being wholie ſpirituall and ſupernaturall, nothing concerning a temporall common wealth, no renouncing or deniall of any authority in England, no conſpiracie to Prince, no betraying of a kingdome, of whome no one worde or mention is made, or can bee intended; no matter giuen in charge, no authoritie communicated, but to offer ſacrifice, to pray, to preach, miniſter Sacraments,Pontifical.

And yet I woulde deſire all States men to conſider, that the Graecians, Germanes, and other people, hauing their doctrine diuers to the Church of Rome, haue their Seminaries in the ſame City, and their Prieſts maintained by the ſame Popes, and ordered by their authoritie; and yet the Princes of thoſe Nations being Infidell Turkes, for the greater part, condemne not their Prieſts for Traitours, but ſuffer them to be quiet, without incumber, admitting the exerciſe of their function as agreeable to common wealth. And as it were a great abſurditie to ſay, that the Pope in releeuing the Catholike Students of Palestina, Graecia, Armenia, and ſuch nations, ſhoulde doe it in hope to be temporall Lord of thoſe Countries, but only for loue to true religion, ſo it is as improbable he ſhould haue any ſuch intent to England, as vnprobable as the others to bee vnder his temporall regiment; or, howe can thoſe religious ſchooles be ſuch aduerſaries to our Engliſh gouernement, where neither Reader, Profeſſor, or Student of Policie is, or by the foundations and ſtatutes of thoſe places may be maintained? No law, order, rule, exerciſe, lecture, or diſputation in any of thoſe Seminaries that hath affinitie with ſuch affaires; where no one point or opinion in doctrine againſt our Engliſh, or any other

well gouerned commonwealth (as is proued) is practized. But all thoſe Schooles by inſtitution, offer weekely or daily ſacrifice for our nation, where prayer is continually made by deputed perſons for her Maieſtie, where ſo many publike prayers, proceſſions, faſting, diſciplines, and auſterities are vſed to that end. The rules and gouernement there conſent with the auntient foundations of our Cambridge and Oxford, the Religion there vſed, the doctrine there taught, the Prieſthoode, and other Orders there taken, ſacrifice offered, prayers that bee made, Sacraments that be frequented, Lawes that bee obſerued, all things there practized, be the ſame which ſo many renowned Kings of England euer profeſſed and defended, as conformable to their temporal regiments: and to which our Qu. Elizabeth, by the fidelitie of a Prince, by ſolemne oath, and all greateſt ſecurity an abſolute Ruler can giue, hath indebted her ſelfe to obſerue at her Coronation. And what diſobedience or want of duety can it be, to deny to her, or any temporall Prince, Supremacy in eccleſiaſticall cauſes, a preeminence ſo diſtinct and independing of the ciuil gouernement? And it euer was ſo far fro treaſon, to deny it to any of our Kings or Queenes, that not onely all Engliſh ſubiects, but our Kings themſelues euer approoued it in the Roman See. And neuer any temporall Turke, Tartare, Goth, Vandall, or impious ennemy of Chriſt, heretike, or infidell challenged it as belonging to their temporall ſtile; and no Proteſtant Prince at this day, except in England, eyther

claimeth to him ſelfe, or maketh it treaſon to giue it to the Pope of Rome. Neyther dooth, or euer did, any or theſe profeſſed ennemies to that See, condemne for a temporall diſobedience, to appeale thither in ſpirituall cauſes; or maketh it a matter of ſtate, to goe on pilgrimage to Rome, or bring a Crucifix, Picture, or any halowed thing from thence, which can be no buſines of a commonwealth.

If wee ſhould enter into compariſon of this kingdome now Proteſtant, eyther with it ſelfe vnder Catholike regiment, or with forraine Catholike kingdomes, my ſentence is true: whether wee conſider the glory of king Henry the eight, and this kingdome before his fall, or their infamie and diſhonours after: or the ſhort or turbulent ſeaſon of king Edward the ſixt, or for this preſent time what it is, and what like to be, which, duety to her Maieſtie chargeth me to leaue to the lamentable conſideration of all men now, and the pittifull experience of thoſe which ſhall prooue it heereafter. When contrariwiſe, if wee enter into conceipt of Catholicke kingdomes, ruled by that Religion and law which we defend, they will be named the flowers of the worlde; our neighbouring countries, Fraunce, Spaine, Italie, and others may be giuen for inſtance.

How can the beginning of ſinnes, firſt inwardly hatched in the mind, before they proceede to outwarde action to bee controlled by ciuill Lawes, be ſtayed and preuented? How can ſecret offences, the mother and nurſe of publike diſorders, be puniſhed and deſtroyed? Who can keepe Subiects from deuiſing againſt Soueraignes, theſe from plotting againſt Subiects, Subiects againſt themſelues? Who can now vmpire ſo many quarrelles, euen with extraordinary and intolerable charges and abuſes, which the Conſiſtory of Confeſſion in euery pariſh, ſo freely, without bribe, trouble, or contention decided and rooted out? For want whereof, ſo many ſuites and actions in lawe, ſuch multitudes of Lawyers, and their lately obtained riches haue enſued. What abuſes in their proceedings, what vniuſt cauſes defended? What iuſt and pittifull complaints of the poore forſaken? What dilatory plees, nonſuites, vnneceſſary eſſoines, wagers of lawe, falſe pleadings, vnlawfull arreſts, wicked impannelling, ſuborning, and corrupting Iurors, delayed falſe and corrupt iudgements, and executions, vnconſcionable Writtes of errour againſt right,

ſuch remooueings of ſutes, appeales, and I know not how many ſhifts to defraude, auoyde, and with-holde true titles, haue beene, and are practiſed and vncontrolled by theſe Proteſtant doctrines, which catholike Religion condemneth, binding the wicked practiſers of ſuch iniuſtices to an equall amends and reſtitution to the parties grieued. Theſe and ſuch abuſes the lawe of Nature, the lawe of Nations, Canon, Imperiall, Prouinciall, in all chriſtian Nations doe condemne, & not onely in countries and kingdoms profeſſing Chriſt, they are diſabled, but exploded in al heatheniſh regiments of Iewes, Turks, Tartares, Perſians, Indians, and all antient law makers among the Romans, Graecians, Lacedemonians, and others, onely practiſed, and not diſallowed in Proteſtant regiments.
               That portion of wealth, which the religious Cleargy of England enioyed in Catholike times, (if Foxe may be beleeued) amounted to the third part of the ſubſtance of our nation,Foxe to. 2. monn. in Henr. 8. and was then employed concerning them, to the neceſſaries of their poore, chaſte, and ſingle life: the remnant was beſtowed, ſome for maintainance and defence of our Kings, and country:Caxt. hiſtor. Hall in H. 5. Stowe & Graft. in Henr. 8. the Catholike Cleargy was then able, and often did furniſh maine armies to that end, more then all the miniſters of England, and Abbey gentlemen are able or will performe, the reſt was in Religious vſes: the poore were relieued, ſo many ſtatutes againſt them, and to burden the country, were not knowne, ſtrangers were lodged, pilgrimes entertained, the ſicke and maimed prouided for,

orphanes kept, widdowes defended. Was not this ſo offenſiue parte of religious goods in Proteſtants iudgement, better beſtowed, then in hunting, hawking, cardings, courtings, and ſuch like almes, to which the Proteſtant poſſeſſours haue diſpoſed it? Let vs ſpeake of friends at home, and abroade; Catholike Religion kept, and left England in friendſhip and amitie, with the Popedome, Empire, Spaine, and all countries in the world: proteſtancy hath either ſet vs at open variance, or ſuſpitious peace withall. Quarrels among countries and kings, are euer grounded from behauiour of Princes, publike magiſtrates, and perſons of regard in thoſe ſtates: Proteſtants of England euer ſince their entraunce haue ſupplied thoſe places priuate, perſecuted and reiected men, ſuch as Catholikes of England haue beene, and are there eſteemed, cannot bee the origin of ſuch contentions. What ſhould I ſpeake of honours, or other publike profits wherwith England was adorned by our Religion, and whereof Proteſtancy hath diſpoyled it? Was it not an honourable, quiet, and ſecure preeminence, to be at league with ſo many and mighty chriſtian Princes? Were not all communions with them and their countries as ordinary to England, and al eſtates thereof, as to themſelues, had not our kings their legarde, and continuing ambaſſadors in thoſe dominions, whereby peace was preſerued, quarrels preuented, perrils auoyded, the country in ſecurity, warres but ſeldome, and neuer of ſuch continuance? What hiſtorie doth make relation of ſo chargeable and prolonged

wars of this kingdome, with other nations, as our late and preſent Spaniſh, Flemiſh, and Iriſh be? What Nobleman ot Gentleman of accompt did not then, and would not now deſire, both for his owne and countries honour, and reputation, to know other nations, to bee preſent in the Courts of forraine potent Princes, to learne language, to ſee diuerſities of people, and manners, to know their order of Regiment, to winne experience? What learning, nurtriture, and knowledge haue our gentry and nobility loſt by that ſeperation? What a blemiſh it is, euen in ſome of higheſt order, and in the greateſt affaires of common wealth, England findeth, and forrainers are not ignorant, and the great aduantage and highly eſteemed preeminence of him or them in that place, which hath enioyed it, will witneſſe. Would not a ſouldier, for his skill and honour in armes, affect to know the order and diſcipline of their warres, eſpecially againſt Infidels, and misbeleeuing Princes? What ſcholler for his inſtruction in learning, might not couet thoſe vniuerſities, wherein for an Engliſhman to haue beene ſtudent, or conſecrated Prieſt (now ſo odious) was euer had for high honour and reputation? Would not the marchants of England eſteeme it both a priuate helpe to themſelues, and a publike profit to our nation, to haue free trade and trafficke in their dominions? Should not all England, Nobles, gentlemen, meaner people, and all eſtates of men, Catholikes, Proteſtants, and whatſoeuer be deſirous, that we might alwayes bee free, both from forraine

and domeſticall warres? or if by any neceſſitie, not in time preuented, we ſhuld by probabilitie bee infeſted with the one, coulde, or would he wiſh to be afflicted with both? Peace is to be deſired, ſtrife to be auoyded, friendes eſteemed, many and potent enimies to be feared. If any man of indifferent ſentence entereth into iudgement, to conſider the time of Proteſtancie, which is paſt, the preſent eſtate wherein England is, and what wee are like to taſte heereafter, by ſuch proceedings, I doubt not but he will be of my opinion, that it were better to be in ſuch condition,Stow hiſt. in H. 8. as it was in the two and twentieth yeere of King Henry the eight, when this reformation, or ſoone after beganne, then euer it was by Proteſtancie ſince, nowe is, or by probability will grow to be in time to come.

Thinke it (you Proteſtant Dames of England) no diſparagement in honor, to be followers of thoſe renowned Princeſſes, which in all Antiquities are recorded to be the glory of your kinde, and the ſupreame womanly honour of our Kingdome; That RELIGION (the greateſt honour) which hath giuen to them ſuch eternitie of honour in Heauen, can not make you diſhonourable in Earth. It is the nature of your ſexe to immitate, and in ſome things you will ſometimes immitate too much: If you that liue in Courte, didde but knowe the guiſe of attires, which thoſe holy Queenes and Ladies vſed, before they were Religious you would follow it, in the higheſt degree; although therein you ſhould conſent with the Dames of Italy, France, Spaine, and Rome it ſelfe, or any other place or perſon, to which you profeſſe your ſelues moſt diſtaſted. And in ſuch things though neuer vſed of Queene Sexburga, Etheldreda, Edelburga, or any of thoſe, or other Saintes, your daily and new deuiſes are euidence againſt you, that you eſteeme it not diſhonourable, to learne of the Ladies of thoſe Nations. Theſe agreements are not ſo worthie praiſe, and yet therein you will not be at variaunce. Then, ſeeing the Religion of thoſe Countries, whoſe Ladies you allowe in matters ſo little deſeruing immitation, is that which maketh ſo honorable with God and man, and not for a ſhort courting,

but an euer-continuing time, feare not to bee French, Spaniſh, Italian, and Roman, in that, wherein the tipe and diademe of true honour conſiſteth; or if you haue choſen to bee wedded onelie to terrene and debaſed honour, yet you may not thinke ſo baſely of that Religion I defend, to diſallowe it. For all your earthly honours, titles, names, and enſignes of dignitie, were eyther firſt founded, or after allowed and confirmed to your aunceſtors, and in them to you, by the Popes, Emperours, Kings, and Regents in Catholike reuerence. England Proteſtant wanteth many degrees of chiefeſt place, which England Catholicke enioyed. England Proteſtant hath diminiſhed, and added none to thoſe, which were before. And thoſe Countries I named, and whoſe Religion I commend vnto you, haue many of that condition, which neuer any England hadde. Catholicke Religion neuer denied any thing vnto you, which was truely honourable: it gaue you your dignities, honourable places, and priuiledges; it gaue you credite with our Princes, and for their and your honour, ordayned you eſtates; it defendeth your marriages to be honorable, and a ſacrament, by that Religion your matrimonie was not in the pleaſure of your Lordes; repudiations and deuorcements at their willes were not knowen; remarrying to a ſecond wife (the former liuing) was euer moſt vnlawfull. Concubines could not poſſeſſe the maintenaunce of your honours, their baſtardes might not enioy the inheritaunce of your legittimate, for feare

of offence, I will be ſilent in moſt honourable fauours, which your Catholike anceſtors had, and you might haue by that Religion, and Proteſtancie cannot giue; and referre that cauſe to your more ſerious examination, and fauourable conſtruction; which, for my promiſe of writing nothing offenſiue to our Engliſh ſtate, I muſt willingly, in this, and other places, leaue naked and vnfurniſhed of many and greateſt arguments of defence.

Therefore I will onely put them in minde, that as all their aunceſtors and predeceſſors were of the ſame RELIGION with vs, ſo an innumerable company of their kinsfolks were religious men, and women, and in them, the care of their parents ended, and they became Fathers and

mothers to their parents, and families; others were attendant, inſtructed, and maintained by penſions, corrodies, farmes, annuities, leaſes, and tenements of our religious houſes; the poore were releeued in our Hoſpitalles, and by our almes; others liuing vppon our landes without fines, or enhaunced rents; euery temporall man and woman enioying more for them and theirs, by howe much ſo many hundred thouſandes of religious perſons claimed and needed leſſe, by their poore and ſingle life. No wife to prouide for ioynture, no daughter to endowe and giue in marriage, no elder ſonne to enrich with new inheritance, and ſpared purchaſes, no yonger ſonne to be aduaunced by emprooued rents, toyles or turnings out of Farmes, no tenaunt chaunged, no fines, no forfeitures taken, no woodes deſtroyed, no priuiledge or freedome withdrawne, many new and greater graunted by Kings, and Noble men, to religious perſons, their tenaunts and tenures: not ſo many iarres and quarrelles in lawe, contentions and debates of the poore ſubiects, comprimitted by ghoſtly confeſſors, religious perſons, and kings themſelues.

               LAſtly, to come to the Proteſtant Miniſtery of England, whoſe anger and diſpleaſure, as I eſteeme it leaſt, ſo I name them laſt. I appeale to all thoſe eſtates I haue recounted, for iudgement, whether in accuſing them of ignoraunce, or wilfulneſſe in errour, I offer them wrong or no: It is more agreeing to the lawe of God, of nature, nations, reaſon, humane ciuilitie, conſcience, or whatſoeuer may bee termed and taken for a lawe, when it dooth ſo chaunce, that either all learned and holy men in the chriſtian worlde, that euer were in ſo many hundred yeeres, in all times and places, ſhould bee condemned, or elſe a few, neyther learned nor vertuous, but ignorant and wicked, ſhould be reprooued and diſallowed, that the moſt and firſt muſt be freeed, and the leaſt and laſt condemned. Then lette the Miniſteriall Cleargie of England yeelde mee patience; for I defend the doctrine and opinion of all godly and famous profeſſors of Diuinitie, all Popes, Fathers, and Doctours that euer were in the Church, all Councelles particular and generall, all forren & domeſticall Vniuerſities, Schooles, Colledges, and places of chriſtian learning, ſince the time of Chriſt, to Martine Luther: where ſo many thouſandes or millions of miraculouſly approoued holy Saintes, haue liued and died, in

If they thinke there euer was true Religion among Chriſtians, and that it was exerciſed in the firſt ſixe hundred yeeres after Chriſt, and that thoſe auncient Fathers which were the moſt famous in thoſe dayes, and ruled the Churche as Biſhoppes and Doctours thereof, were acquainted with it, or Profeſſours of it: I haue carefully read ouer all the workes and writings which bee to be had, of Dyoniſius the Areopagite Scholler to Saint Paul, Saint Ignatius, Saint Polycarpus, Saint Clement, Martialis liuing in the Apoſtles time, Saint Iuſtine, Origen, Saint Baſill, Saint Athanaſius, Saint Gregory Nazianzene, Saint Gregory Niſſen, Saint Gregorie the Great, Saint Irenaeus, Saint Cyprian, Fulgentius, Pamphilus the Martire, Palladius, Theodoretus, Ruffinus, Socrates, Sozomenus, Euagrius, Caſſianus, Lactantius Firmianus, Vincentius Lyrenenſis, the moſt famous and learned Fathers of thoſe vncorrupted ages,

all the workes of all theſe I haue read and examined, and conferred them with Saint Augustine, Saint Hierome, Saint Ambroſe, Saint Leo, Papias the ſcholler of Saint Iohn the Euangeliſt, Theophilact, Tertullian, Euſebius Ceſarienſis, Prudentius, and others, moſt excellent Diuines, liuing when all Proteſtants agree, true faith was vniuerſally preached, and beleeued. And yet I take God, and the whole Courte of Heauen to witneſſe, before whome I muſt render an accompt of this proteſtation, my beleefe, and all my actions (my conſtant writing in defence of this Faith, my ſelfe voluntarily in diſgrace and perſecution profeſſing it, will be my warrant of ſinceritie.) That the ſame Faith and Religion which I defend, is taught and confirmed by thoſe holy Hebrew and Greeke Scriptures, thoſe Hiſtorians, Popes, Decrees, Scholies and Expoſitions, Councels, Schooles, and Fathers, and the profeſſion of Proteſtants, and all other Sectes by the ſame condemned. I haue examined, and with diligent aduiſe read ouer many Bookes and Writings of the beſt learned Proteſtantes (the Woorke to which this Epiſtle is a Preamble will be my witneſſe,) and not any that euer came to my hands, containeth any argument or reaſon, in my iudgement, woorthy, or able to withdrawe a reaſonable and indifferent minde, not blinded with pleaſure, or ſeduced by affection, from embracing that Catholike Faith which I defend; or that can eſtabliſh or prooue any other Religion to be true. That I ſhould not bee able to

iudge what maketh for vs, what againſt vs, I hope no man will challenge mee of ſo great ignorance. That I would willingly erre and perſiſt in errour, (if my religion were errour) to followe a profeſſion ſo auſtere and rigorous to ſenſuall appetite, and deſire, if it be compared to Proteſtant doctrine, and obſtinately heape diſgrace and affliction vpon my ſelfe, to profeſſe it, when by reforming my opinion or conſcience to the contrary, I might both auoide the penitentiall life of Catholike profeſſion, and the perilles and penalties which the Parliaments of Proteſtants haue impoſed vppon vs, and enioy the liberties and delights which Proteſtancie yeeldeth, and the preferrements wherewith their Schollers are rewarded. I am out of doubt no Reader can be ſo partiall and vnequall iudge againſt mee, or any one of ſo many Engliſh Catholicke Students, which are in the ſame caſe, and defend the ſame cauſe.
            
            
               
                  SECT. XII. The Concluſion: how diſhonourable and vnreaſonable it is, to perſist in Protestancie: howe honourable to graunt a Reformation.
               WHerefore (noble Patrones) ſeeing ſo many worldes of witneſſes giue euidence againſt the profeſſion of Proteſtants, and euery age, time, place, perſon, and

thing of woorthy and credible authoritie, yeeld teſtimony to my defence, I will recomfort my ſelfe, that by your gratious and iuſt protection, no man will be ſo wilfull to impugne that which God, and all reaſonable creatures, and reaſon, haue alwayes, and by all meanes propugned. I knowe your Honours are wiſe, and I truſt no man will ſo much condemne himſelfe, in obſtinacie, to be of Luthers minde, (and if hee bee not, he cannot be a Proteſtant) which although hee euidently perceiued in his owne iudgement, and manifeſtly confeſſed in his owne writings, the whole chriſtian worlde, all times, places, perſons, and Authorities to bee againſt him, yet hee obſtinately proceeded in his ſingularitie. The woordes of that graceleſſe Luther are theſe:Luther. tom. 2. Germ. Ientac. fol. 9. & Praefat. l. de abrog. miſs. 
                  How often hath my heart panted, and reprehended me, and obiected againſt mee? What? arte thou onely wiſe? can it bee credible, that all others doe erre, and haue erred ſo long a time? Haue all Generations ſo often euer been deceiued? What if thou dooſt erre, and bring ſo many into errour, that ſhall bee damned for euer?
                  Luther. in colloq. menſal. fol. 10. & praefat. ſup. 
                  Arte thou onelie hee which hath the true pure worde of God? Hath no man in the worlde the ſame, but thou? That which the Church of Christ hath hitherto defined, and ſo many yeeres obſerued as good, doost thou ouerthrowe it, as though it were euill, and ſo doost diſſipate by thy doctrine, both Eccleſiasticall and Ciuill Common-weales? Thus, in thoſe, and other places, his owne conſcience and iudgement did accuſe and condemne him, of ſingular obſtinate rebellion, and diſobedience,

to the Church of God, as appeareth, and he further declareth in theſe wordes:Luther. tom. 1. Germ.

                  I neuer put thoſe thoughts and cogitations foorth of my minde, that is, that this worke and buſineſſe (hee meaneth his Apoſtacie) had neuer beene begunne by mee: For, what a greate multitude of men haue I ſeduced by my Doctrine? I neuer had a greater and more greeuous temptation, than for my preaching, becauſe I thought with my ſelfe, thou hast ſtirred vp all this tumult, in which temptation oftentimes, I haue beene drowned euen to Hell it ſelfe. Thus, his conſcience, ſo long as hee had any, condemned him; thus, hee repented his diſobedience, and ſaide, that hee hoped,Luther. in Praefat. in tom. 1. Germ. Ientacul. the Bookes which hee had written woulde bee burnt, and infect no more. But when the bridle of Obedience was altogether broken, his Conſcience extinguiſhed, and plumes of pride and ſenſualitie had mounted him ſo high, and carried him ſo farre, hee behaued himſelfe in his ſpirituall apoſtacie, as by the teſtimonie of Suetonius,

                  Iulius Caeſar did in his temporall rebellion againſt the Romane ſtate; which in the beginning, doubted whether hee ſhould go forwarde, or no; but when hee hadde caſt off ſhame, brake out into this ſpeach, Iacta est alea; My chaunce is throwne, the matter is gone ſo farre, that I can not retire, therefore I must goe forwarde, howſoeuer it falleth out. Euen ſo Luther (as you haue heard) did in the beginning; but when ſhipwracke was made of all ſhamefaſtneſſe, hee vttered his deſperate and vnreaſonable reſolution of obſtinate perſeueraunce in theſe termes; Becauſe I

                  nowe I must looke vnto it, and of neceſſitie ſay, It is iust. If you aske a reaſon, Doctour Martine Luther will haue it ſo. Sic volo, ſic iubeo, ſit pro ratione voluntas; So I will, ſo I commaunde, let my pleaſure ſtand for a reaſon: for wee will not be Schollers, but Maisters and Iudges of Papists, yea wee will once (Proteruire & inſultare) bee malaparte and inſulte ouer them. I Doctour Martine Luther, an vnwoorthie Euangelist of our Lorde Ieſus Christ, do ſay and affirme this Article (faith alone without woorkes dooth iuſtifie before God) the Romane Emperour ſhall ſuffer it to ſtand and remayne, the Emperour of the Turkes, the Emperour of the Tartares, the Emperour of the Perſians, the Pope of Rome, the Cardinalles, Biſhoppes, Priestes, Moonkes, Nunnes, Princes, Lordes, the whole world, with all Diuelles, and they ſhall further haue hell fire ouer their heads, and I will giue them no thanks for their paines: let this be my instinct from the holy ghost, of Doctour Luther, and my true and holie Goſpell. This (right Honourable) was the ſpirite and ground, wherevppon you ſee Proteſtancie was firſt founded, by this it was builded, by this it was and is continued.Eccleſ, c. 10. c. 1 As the Scripture witneſſeth, Pride, Wine, and Women are the originalles of Apostacie; and ſo it was in Luther, ſo it was in all theſe Authors of this innouation. If Pride had not beene, they had kept their vowe of obedience: If wine, delicacies, and riches had not borne a ſway, they had continued their vowe of pouertie: if women, wantonneſſe, and carnall pleaſures had

not carried them away, their vowe of chaſtity had not beene broken, Proteſtancie founded vppon thoſe three pillers, had not bin knowne; true Religion had not beene forſaken. And yet experience hath prooued, that all the pride and glorie of the worlde, all the riches, pomps, pleaſures and ſenſible delights, that haue moued carnall men, to oppoſe themſelues againſt it, cannot ouerthrowe it, but Trueth is ſtronger than all: and the Probleme which the nobles of Darius putte vnder the pillowe of their Prince,L. 3. Eſdr. c. 3. to be diſputed and argued, when hee ſhoulde awake, is performed, Wine is ſtrong, the King is ſtronger, Women are ſtronger: aboue all things Trueth dooth ouercome. For, whatſoeuer pleaſures, riotous and banquetting delights, honour, ambition, preferrement, or the power, potencie of King or Potentate coulde euer doe, or wantonneſſe, and carnall ſolace, or any thing elſe King or Queene, man or woman coulde hitherto effect, or bring to paſſe; the verity of this Religion, and onelie of this, hath ſtill preuailed.

What the latter in the Tower was, no man is ignorant howe much it did diſgrace them. No lawe of God, of Nature, of any Nation, doth, or can iudge, conuict, and condemne the vileſt Subiect in the meaneſt matter, if hee bee abſent, but where

               Then my Lordes and Patrones, as you are wiſe, you knowe what to doe, as you are gracious with our Queene, in whoſe handes the redreſſe of this matter lieth, as you are maiſters of your ſelues, potent and beloued with the Nobles, and powerable with all her people, you are able to performe what is to bee doone; as you are mercifull, you muſt take compaſſion; as iuſtice belongeth to your place, you can not make deniall. The matter it ſelfe, all circumſtaunces of perſons, places, and time, bidde mee bee ſecure, you will heare my petition.

Noble Patrones, your office is to ſeeke for peace, and maintaine it, the eſtate of our Princes, and all hir people is to

wiſh it, that fauour I intreate, is the way to perfect peace, to peace with heauen, to peace with earth, with all others, with our ſelues. All things deſire peace, and ſeeke for reſt, and your wiſedomes are not, will not, cannot be againſt it. And to knowe the way of peace, there is a ground in Artes, vppon which all knowledge is grounded; Quae conueniunt vnitertio, conueniunt inter ſe, &c. Thoſe thinges that agree in a third thing, agree among themſelues, and ſuch as diſagree in a third, diſagree among themſelues. For if things agree, they muſt needes agree in ſomething, if they agree not in that wherein they ſhoulde agree, of neceſſity they muſt be at variance; and at greater difference, by howe much their difference is greater, in that wherein they ſhoulde conſent; this is euident in all communities and agreements. That which maketh peace and vnitie with God and man, is true Religion, that bindeth them together. That which vniteth Chriſtians, is the one certaine rule and promulgation of that faith; that which concordeth man with himſelfe, and the inferiour appetites to reaſon, is the grace which that Religion giueth, and by howe much wee differ moſt in theſe things, by ſo much our diſagreement with God, with men, with our ſelues is greater. The Kingdomes, and Countries, Kings and Rulers of Spaine, Fraunce, Italie, Polonia, Sueuia, Tranſiluania, Bohemia, Auſtria, Bauaria, Sauoy, Lorraine, Brittanie, Burgundy, and other Countries agree in theſe things, and they are at perfect vnitie and

peace; and vntill they did agree therein, they were not. And all other Countries and Kingdomes agree more or leſſe, as they agree herein; there is no Religion wherein England can agree with any, becauſe the Religion thereof is different from all; neither can any twoo Proteſtant Nations haue this peace together, becauſe no twoo of them bee of one Religion. If wee will agree in this poynt with Catholicke Nations, wee ſhall agree with God, becauſe true Religion is our vnion with him, wee ſhall agree with Angelles, for the ſame is approoued with them, wee ſhall agree with all glorious ſoules in Heauen, for this is neceſſarie to the communion and communication of Saints; wee ſhall be at concorde with the happy patient Chriſtians in Purgatorie, wee ſhall haue peace with our ſelues, with all Catholicke Chriſtians in the worlde, that be, that euer were before vs, or ſhall be after. Wee ſhall agree with all, with whome atonement muſt and ought to bee made, and diſagree with none, but with Diuelles, damned ſpirites, and ſuch as doe, will, and can agree with none, and with whom no good man, in conſcience, can agree in ſuch things. And our agreement ſhall be perfect, indſſoluble, generall, and for euer, becauſe the e

if you performe it, you ſhall effect the moſt honourable and renowned thing our age hath ſeene, and they which ſo much deſire it, and iuſtly deſerue it, will not, can not bee vngratefull in their liues and words, and in their writings, will make you honourable to all poſterities. If you can performe it, and neglect it, although you be no formall perſecutours, yet becauſe you ſuffer others to doe it, and leaue it in their power, when you may amend it, you wil be in the degree of diſhonor both with God and man, as thoſe enemies which I remembred before, and except you recall your mindes, like to taſte of the ſame vengeance they haue done; it is the cauſe of God, which is powerable to puniſh, that is, iuſt, and will take reuengement. What is beſt to be done, your Honors knowe, and no man can be ignorant; what you wil do, I commit to your honourable and prudent conſideration, and your Honours to Gods protection. And craue leaue to giue my lawfull charge vpon theſe impious and irreligious enemies of Chriſt, and rebellious traitours to his holy Catholike Church, and euer-during Inheritance. 25.
