            Shewing,
THat Sir Thomas Dale her huſband being imployed (in the yeare 1617) by the Eaſt India Companie as
chiefe Commander of their Fleete into the Eaſt Indies,Sir Tho. Dale imployed to the Eaſt-Indies by the Company, dyeth, leauing a great eſtate there in his ſhip belonging to the petitioner as his Executrix. and there dying (in the yeare 1619) leauing a great
eſtate there in money and other things (in his Ship called the Moone, then floating at Sea) to the value of
20000 pounds, all which after his death belonged to the Petitioner as ſole Executrix of his laſt Will made before
his going in that Voyage.
            Shortly after his death, one Thomas Iones a Factor for the Companie there, and Robert Owen a ſeruant of the ſaid
Sir Thomas,
               His eſtate there after his death ſpoiled by the Cōpanies factors and his own ſeruant, and ſhared between thē & the Gouerners, Treaſurers and Cōmittees of the Company, & his ſtate-bookes taken and ſuppreſſed by them. by confederacie with George Ball, William Methald and Auguſtine Spaulding Factors likewiſe for the ſaid
Companie (according to the vſuall cuſtomes of thoſe Factors in caſe of any mans death there, by a forehand priuate
direction from the Gouerners, Treaſurers and Committees of that Companie, to ſeize vpon all his goods
for the vſe of the Companie, and ſo to ſwal
                  •
               ow vp all his eſtate) got aboord the ſaid Ship in the abſence both of
the Maſter and Purſer of the ſame, and there vnlawfully brake into Sir Thomas his Cabbin and ſtore-roome, and
tooke and carried from thence all his money, goods and eſtate there whatſoeuer, together with diuers written
bookes and memorials of the particulars of his eſtate there, which bookes and memorials they haue ſuppreſſed and
concealed, and haue ſhared all the ſaid eſtate betweene themſelues; and the ſaid Gouerners, Treaſurers and Committees
of the ſaid Companie giuing no part thereof, nor the ſight of the ſaid bookes and memorials to the Petitioner
euer ſithence.
            The ſaid Gouerners,The Gouerners, Treaſurers and Cō
                  mittees practiſe further to defeate her of all her eſtate at home, lying in their hands. Treaſurers and Committes not herewith content, haue ſince practiſed to defeate the Petitioner
of all her eſtate at home (lying all in their hands) being a matter of 2000 poūds or neare thereabouts, aduentured
by her ſaid husband in both the ioynt ſtocks of that Companie, beſides the profits thereof and ſome other
moneys owing by the Companie to her husband, cauſing an officer of theirs to charge her for that purpoſe
with ſuppoſed debts of her husbands to the Companie, to the value of 2600 pounds, which vpon examination of
another of their officers in her cauſe, hath been ſince confeſſed by him vpon oath to be an vniuſt charge, and excuſed
as a miſtaken by the Companie.
            That the Petitioner hath ſought remedy for the former of theſe wrongs (done in the Indies) by a ſuite in the
Admiraltie Court againſt the ſaid Iones and Owen,
               She ſeeks remedy in the Court of Admiraltie for her wrongs beyond ſeas, but obtaines not iuſtice there according to her proofes. being the principall actors of the ſaid wrongs and ſpoile there,
where notwithſtanding that good proofe was made, as well of their ſaid vnlawfull fact, as of diuers particulars of
the ſaid eſtate (to a great value) ſo vnlawfully taken away by them, beſides a much greater eſtate concealed by
their taking and ſuppreſſing of the ſaid bookes and memorials, yet through the greatneſſe and potencie of the
ſaid Gouerners, Treaſurers and Committes bearing thoſe fellowes out in that ſuite againſt the Petitioner, ſhe
could not there obtaine recompence of the ſaid wrongs,All ſhe hath, thus detained from her, not able to maintaine ſuite, her witneſſes not to be had at all times, their depoſitions already taken, not ſeruing in any other Court. according to her proofe made thereof.
            So the ſaid Gouerners, Treaſurers and Committees, and thoſe others before mentioned, detaining from the Petitioner
all ſhe hath; and the ſaid Gouerners, Treaſurers and Committees not onely denying to yeeld her any part
of her meanes in their hands, either for the righting of her ſelfe by ſuite, or for her neceſſary maintenance, but refuſing
alſo very ſcornfully as much as to treate with her (or her friends for her) of iuſtice and equitie, eſpecially becauſe
the depoſitions already taken in her cauſe, will not auaile her in any other ordinary Court; and her witneſſes
(of the wrongs done her beyond Seas) being ſea-faring men, are not to be produced at all times to
ſerue her turne, ſome of them (who haue been examined already in her cauſe) being ſince gone againe to
Sea.Praying this high Court to conſider of her cauſe, to call the parties, to view the ſtate-books and the proofes already made, and thereupō to take order for her reliefe.
            
            Humbly therefore prayeth this honorable Court to take her cauſe into their conſiderations, to call the
parties aboue mentioned (or ſuch of them as are neare at hand) to appeare forthwith before them, commanding
them to bring the ſaid bookes and memorials into the Court, and vpon view thereof, together with ſuch
proofes as are already made in the cauſe, without further trouble or other examinations, to take ſuch order
for her reliefe and ſatisfaction for the ſaid ſeuerall wrongs, as their wiſedomes ſhall finde agreeable to iuſtice
and equitie.
