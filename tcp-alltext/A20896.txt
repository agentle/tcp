                  AS me semeth we haue spoken ynoughe of the matter of two of the fyrst poyntes and of the brauuches longynge to the same / Upon whiche the naturall prynce and not the tyraunte ought to be founde / vpon the fete of his gouer naunce lyke as we haue promysed to speke of here before. That is to were howe he ought to loue and drede god aboue all thynges. ¶ Also the seconde poynte that he shol de loue and kepe the comon welthe of his londe more than his owne propre. ¶ Nowe we must speke of the thyrde poynte whi che is / that he ought to kepe and loue Iustyce / where vpon we must fyrst se what is Iustyce / & afterwarde the maner howe the good prynce ought to kepe it / and what thynges be necessa ry for the kepynge therof. And howe the olde auncyentes that were well taught kepte it. And vpon this we wyll shewe some

ensamples to y• purpose lyke as we haue done here tofore? Ary stotle saythe / that Iustyce is a measure that yeldeth to euery man his ryght. And yet a man might declare more vpon this worde after the dyscrypcyon of the sayd vertue / but for as moche as I haue before this tyme touched this matter and specyally in the boke of dyscrypcyon / whiche is made of the wysdome of man. I passe the more lyghtly ouer at this tyme for by cause that I wyll declare you ensamples accordynge to oure matter. Fyrste the good prynce ought to loue Iustyce in suche wyse / that for no maner of fauoure he breke it not? For the aun cyent faders before vs loued Iustyce so well / that they wolde not spare theyr owne chyldren?

So it fortuned afterwarde that his sone brake this cōmaundement / and forthe withall he wolde haue doone this Iustyce vpon hym. But for as moche as that he sholde reygne after hym and he were made blynde of bothe eyen / yt semed to hym that he myght ne uer gouerne well his subiectes / nor the comon welthe of hys royalme▪ wherfore he founde a remedy for to satysfye his com maundement▪

of people that were called Uolques. But before or the batayle telle

This sayd Aulus Postumus happened to go out of his hooste for certayne matters that he had to do. So it fortuned that a sone of his had a knowlege where a cerayne of his enemyes were lodged and anone he toke a certayne people with hym & faught with them and dyscomfyted theym. And when his fader was come home agayne to his hooste / and herde of this thynge / an one he gaue Iugemente and sayd / that it was more harme for to saue that man fro dethe that breketh the lawes and commaundementes of prynces / not withstondynge that he had the vyctory of his enemyes / and also for ensample to other men / than the dyscomfyture of a fewe po

And fyrst he must be puruayed specyally of ryghtwyse & true counsaylers / and that they loue better y• lyfe and worshyp of the prynce and the welthe of the comons / than theyr owne synguler profyte.

So it happened on a tyme that an olde auncyent man wente to the Theatre of Athenes for to se the pleyes. This Theatre was a place in whiche all the yon ge men assembled in / for to proue theyr myght one ayenst another / as in armes / or Iustes / or wrastelynges / and all suche other thynges.

               UA lere telleth in ye chapytres that speketh of customes howe ye noble auncyentes enduced theyr chyldren say enge in this wyse / y• as sone as they were ony thynge growen that they myght suffre ony payne / they toke them awaye ano ne from theyr moders & made put them in excercyse to suffre payne and trauayle accordynge to theyr ages and strengthe. And in the same age acustomed them to bere hatnes of warre after theyr strengthe / and to put theym in excercyse of laboure both theyr armes & hondes that was not to greuous for them ¶ Also they were not nourysshed with noo tryaunte meetes▪ nor they were not nysely arayed as some be nowe a dayes / but they were fedde with groce meetes. And as for theyr gownes they vsed a propre facyon of an habyte that the nobles myght were / and none other men. But trust certaynly that they were not furred with martres nor embrowdred nother. Also they acustomed them for to lye harde / & to goo late to bedde / & aryse erely. And made them to suffre al maner of other portable pay nes that belonged to the feate of armes. And by suche meanes y• noble auncyentes nourysshed theyr chyldren / whiche caused

theym afterwarde come to grete worshyp. Lyke as it appereth by theyr olde dedes. Also the maner and the guyse of the gentylles of Almayne / & of other places also ought wel to be alow ed for bycause that they put theyr chyldren for to serue gentyl men worse then themselfe / and make theym theyr pages for to folowe theym for because they sholde suffre dyuers paynes & trauayles / yet I byleue when they come to theyr age▪ they were neuer the lesse wrothe. For gentylmen that ben so nourysshed be more enterprenaunt in the feates of the warre then they that ben made mynyouns and fedde vp dylycately. For as Ue gece sayth of knyghthode they be appropred to armes that ben acustomed to laboure.

I saye it is false. For the delycate meetes corrupte more the body then the groce meetes / For Arystotle sayth▪ the delycatyues nouryssheth not the membres of man / soo moche as dothe the grete meetes And we fynde it also by experyence. For the Brytouns and the

                  ormaunes / whiche ben nourysshed com monly with grete meetes / and be not delycate in theyr meetes and drynkes ben more harde & stronge then other men. wher fore they be more desyred in warre then other men▪ and semblably the bourgonyouns and other nacyons whiche acustomed not to lyue in dylycacy. And also the Romayns / as Ualere say th enduced theyr chyldren in all good maners / and kepte them in fere and drede / and vnder obeysaunce / whiche gouernaunce was ordeyned by grete wysdome and reason. For lyke as it is wryten in the booke of twelue abusyons / the thyrde degree of abusyon is the yonge man that is without obeysaunce; in whome ought to be / Seruyce / Subieccyon / and humylyte. /

For lyke as a man can fynde no fruyte in trees that be not flo rysshed in lyke wyse maye no man attayne to honoure that ha th no laboure in his youthe / in some maner of obeysaunce and dyscyplyne / And of this humylyte that the chyldren of the nobles were sometyme acustomed in.

euery man ought to prayse & cōmende the good bourgeyses & Cytezyns of euery towne & cyte / & yet it is a fayre thynge & a worshypfull when there is a notable bourgeys in a cyte & grete worshyp to ye countre & grete rychesse to ye prynce. These people sholde entremete of the gouernaunce of Cytees & to se what longeth to the marchauntes and to ye comon people so that euery thynge myght be well ruled and gouerned to theyr profyte / & for bycause that ye propre people haue not comonly grete prudence in worde / ne also in dede / that toucheth polycye / whiche they ought not to medle as of suche thynges yt ben establysshed by the prynces. The burgeyses therfore ought to take good hede yt for ony thynge yt is made / the poore people be not hurte / nor yt they haue cause to make ony euyll conspyracyon ayenste theyr prynce or his counsayle / & this is ye cause why / for suche conspyracyons & ymagynacyons of comon / it tourneth all day to the preiudyce of them yt haue good for to leese. For it was neuer other nor neuer shall be / but ye ende therof shall be euyll & full of preiudyce / wherfore they ought & ony suche case fall at ony tyme yt the comons fele thēselfe greued by ony grete charge. The wyse burgeyses sholde assemble themselfe togyder suche as be wyse & dyscrete bothe in worde & dede / & go to ye prynces or to ye counsayle & there make theyr supplycacyon with all humylyte & shewe theyr matter debonayrely to ye entente that the comon people be not hurte / For it is the dystruccyon of Cytees / of townes / & londes & therfore they sholde appeale ye murmuracyons of ye people as ferforthe as they myght for ye grete hurtes & myscheues yt maye fall therof by many meanes.

to euery man / & also there may be peryll in murmurynge of the people. ¶ Ualere sayth yt the worde of Socrates yt worshypfull phylosophre were ryght noble & good when he sayd it was a grete wysdome for a man to holde his peas / For on a tyme he was in a place where were many men that spake of the ordynaunce of prynces and spake shreoodely therof / soo one of these euyll spekers came to Socrates and asked hym why he spake noo worde & all other men sayd theyr aduyse: he answered them agayne & sayd. I holde my peas quod he for bycause that I haue spoken suche wordes at some tyme that I haue repented after / but I was neuer shente for holdynge my peas.
               Therfore it is ryght a good thynge for a mā to holde his peas & speke no suche wordes as harme may come of and no profyte & by yt a man may knowe a wyse man / & therfore Caton sayth ye fyrst vertue is to kepe well his tongue for he is nyghe to god yt in way of reason can holde his tongue.
