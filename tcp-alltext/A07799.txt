Which publike peremptorineſſe theſe Apologiſts may ſeeme by this their more ingenuous dealing to checke and controll, except that they will be thought to haue vttered the voices Temporum potiùs quàm hominum.
            
            Concerning their progreſſe. Although the Apologie be farre from that abſoluteneſſe, which the publiſher thereof pretendeth, who iudgeth it to be in ſome things demonſtratiuely vnanſwerable, as other Romaniſts do likewiſe conceiue: yet notwithſtanding whatſoeuer Argument of ſingular moment is vſed in the volumes of the Romiſh Doctours, or what colourable accordance ſoeuer hath proceeded from the pen of any learned Proteſtant, which appeared in anie degree aduantagious vnto their Roman cauſe; that ſeemeth herein to haue bene collected, vrged, and reinforced againſt vs with as ſingular choiſe of matter, with as ponderous weight of cōſequence, with an as exact and exquiſite a method and ſtyle, together with as ſober a temper of ſpeech, as they by their diligence, iudgement, wit, Art, and moderation could eaſily performe.
            This ſeene, forthwith our most reuerend, carefull, and religious Metropolitane commanded a certaine number of Diuines, then at hand, to employ their ſtudies for the perfecting of a ſatisfiable Reply: which had accordingly bene ſufficiently accompliſhed, had not the heate of the common ſickneſſe, and other their importunate occurrences hindered their indeuours. At what time the

burthen (my occaſions then better ſorting) did (yet not by choiſe but by chance) fall vpon me, the weakest and vnworthieſt of thoſe parties aſsigned: which, notwithſtanding, after a due peruſall of the Apologie, I did at length vndergo, not vpon preſumption of any ſingular dexterity in my ſelfe, but as in confidence that God would enable me hereunto, he being In minimis maximus, and often chooſing the weake things to confound the ſtrong: ſo alſo vpon an experience that diuerſe Romiſh Doctors would be at hand ready to lend me herein their beſt ſupport.
            Which kind of aſsiſtance of learned Aduerſaries the Apologiſts themſelues In the Epiſtle dedicatory to your Maieſtie. haue layd downe for the greateſt reaſon of ſatisfaction, and we do accordingly admit. For if it be held an excellent point of phyſicke, Ex Vipera theriacum, to turne poiſon into an Antidote againſt poiſon; and in God accounted an high degree of vengeance, to turne the Aegyptians againſt the Aegyptians; 
               Eſay. 19. 1. and in Dauid celebrated as a principall matter of triumph, to cut off Goliah his head with his own ſword; and in Chriſt obſerued as an vnanſwerable maner of conuiction to iudge the euil ſeruant from his owne

                  . againſt them their owne Poet, whom he calleth their Prophet: thē may we iustly preſume better of our cauſe, wherein our Romiſh Aduerſaris will proue our rightfull Aduocates.

               A Letter was ſent me by M. Roger Brereley, together with a booke of M. Iohn Brereley, being the ſecond edition of their Romane Apologie: the tenour of which Letter followeth.
            
               
                  
                     To the worſhipfull M. Doctor Morton, Deane of Gloceſter, theſe be deliuered with all ſpeed poſſible.
                  
                     Worſhipfull Maiſter Doctor, I haue met by good chance with this booke, which I ſend you here incloſed: I take it to be another Edition of that booke, which I vnderſtand you are in anſwering, which is the cauſe that I make ſo much ſpeed to ſend you it, leſt that you ſhould haue committed ſome ouerſights, which are diſcouered in this, and may tend to your great diſgrace, if you vſe not due preuention. It ſeemeth to me not to be an eaſie matter to ſatisfie any iudicious Reader, for this Author is very exact, and quoteth your owne Authors, which are extant, and cannot be denied: and if you ſhould not anſwer very directly, but runne to other not ſo pertinent diſcourſes, I feare your credit
                           •
                         will not be a little ſtained. I wiſh you well, but my chiefe deſire is that truth may be diſcouered in ſuch important affaires as theſe are. Wherefore be ſure to helpe to ſet forward this, or elſe ſuppreſſe your bookes, and impoſe ſilence to your ſelfe. And I will be glad to heare of your beſt reſolutions, and euer reſt
                  
                  
                     Your louing friend,
Roger Brereley.
                  
               
            
            
               
                  My Anſwer.
                  I Receiued this letter, being without date, and brought vnto my lodging by a meſſenger, who meant for that preſent to be without name, promiſing to retume the next day, but did not, except it were without appearance. The booke was printed, Anno 1608. but was not tendered vnto me vntill Anno 1609, October 28. being the next day after that I had preſented this my Appeale vnto his Maieſtie. And is it credible that maiſter Roger Brereley ſhould onely by chance happen vpon their ſo famous an Apologie, not vntill almoſt a yeare after it was printed? Shall we thinke that there could be no better correſpondence betweene theſe two, brothers (as I am informed) both by Prieſthood and blood? Or can any imagine that he ſeeking to premoniſh me with all ſpeed poſsible, could find no poſſible meanes of conueyance in almoſt a yeares ſpace? I cannot thinke that he was then amongſt the Antipodes, but rather antepedes, whoſe letters, ſent for the preuention of this Appeale, were not deliuered vnto me, before the very day next following the publication thereof. Vncourteouſly (I might haue ſaid, vnconſcionably) done: euen to this

                  An anſwer to the exceptions made againſt me in the ſecond Edition of this Romiſh Apology.
                  The firſt, pag. 10. line 16. My calling of a Loyall Romane ſubiect a white Aethiopian, you ſhould haue added, In a Proteſtant ſtate: and haue vnderſtood, with me, ſuch Romaniſts onely as are led by thoſe guides, whoſe poſitions were there diſcouered to be altogether rebellious; but conſult you with your ſelfe, and then tell me, I pray you, of what colour that loyaltie is, which denieth the oath of Allegeance?
                  
                  The ſecond, pag. 18. I, indeed, excuſed this ſaying of Caluine, When Kings command any thing against God, they berea
                           •
                        e themſelues of all authoritie; ſhewing that he meant not thereby that they were abſolutely no Kings; but ſo far onely as they commanded any thing againſt God, in ſuch a caſe not man but God muſt be obeyed. This (ſay you) is vnworthie D. Mortons iudgement, and learning. And why? I will ſtill ſtand to my former promiſe, which was vtterly to abandon Caluine his iudgement, if my expoſition of his words be not euincible out of the place of Caluin: viz. Daniel will not obey King Darius forbidding him to pray vnto the true God: he is therefore caſt vnto the Lions: God deliuereth him: the king is glad, and Daniel ſaid vnto the king, O king liue for euer. &c. Daniel diſobeyed Darius his vnlawfull command, and therein onely did not acknowledge his authoritie, which otherwiſe he did ſtill honour and proclaime, ſaying from his heart (ſaith Caluine) O king liue for euer: or, God ſend thee a long reigne. What can be more plaine?
                  The third, pag. 180. That which you obiect concerning Syricius, is confuted from your owne Authors in this Appeale. See lib. 4. cap. 9. §. 1. &c.
                  The fourth, pag. 443. (note *) in the marg. I alledged nothing but the teſtimonie of your Alfonſus de Caſtro. You ſay it is vnfitting. Trie this. Cardinall Bellarmine denied that any did mox cognoſcere Lutherum, that is, preſently acknowledge Luther, at his firſt renouncing of Poperie. Alfonſus nameth diuerſe, qui illum expectaſſe videntur, & ſtatim illi adhaeſerunt; that is, who might ſeeme to haue expected him before he came, and as ſoone as he was come did cleane vnto him.
                  
                  The Memorandum, that the Treatiſe of the Kingdome of Iſrael, and of the Church, dedicated vnto Q. Elizabeth, was the worke of another Tho. Morton, who was of Chriſts Colledge: for I neuer publiſhed any booke in her Maieſties reign.
                      laſt exception, pag. 740. in the margent, you charge me with frauds out of the teſtimony of Delrio the Ieſuite, cōcerning the diuels apparition vnto an Abbot, perſwading him to ſay Maſſe. Which my error in that allegation I confeſſed in mine own Animaduerſions, at the end of my Apologie, and repaired it with another example of the ſame kind out of the ſame Author Delrio: therefore this your taxation might haue bin left vnto your M. Theoph. 
                     
                        M. Higgons obiected the ſame error. See my anſwer vnto him, pag. 8. 
                     Higgons. I pray you, good M. Breerly, know that this manner of dealing cannot conſiſt with any modeſt Replie. Our Lord Ieſus bleſſe vs to the glorie of his ſauing grace.

Which act of one Pope againſt another may more then probably proue, that about the dayes of S. Gregorie the writings and Decrees of Popes were not receiued for vndoubted determinations of truth.
                  6 Wherfore, albeit it hath pleaſed God to preſerue the bookes of S. Gregory, together with the learned monuments of ancient Fathers, for the better direction of his Church: yet knowing that their owne Doctors haue bene bold to note (how worthily we need not determine) diuerſe his defects both in learning & iudgement, by a too credulous approbation of vulgar Miracles, too violent an interpretatiō of diuine Scriptures, too rigorous cenſure againſt Mariage, too Iewiſh a conceit of Leuiticall ceremonies, too terrible a ſentence vpon the ſoules of the vnbaptized Infants, and other ſuch like aberrations: the commendation of his godlineſſe cannot euince an infallibilitie of his iudgement. l Albulenſis. q 57. in 4.

7 Howſoeuer, we haue not related ſuch like his eſcapes in deſperation of our owne cauſe, as though S. Gregorie would appeare an aduerſarie againſt vs; but that our Apologiſts may permit vnto Proteſtants vpon as good, or rather better reaſon, to vſe that libertie, which their owne Doctors haue practiſed, being in effect no more then that which their learned Durand teacheth vs to obſerue, to wit, that

                  8 And now we proceed to diſcuſſe the Minor propoſition, wherein they haue promiſed to proue that S. Gregory taught their now Romiſh doctrine in euery particular. In their maner of performance whereof they haue made a triple forfeit of their credit: becauſe we ſhall demonſtrate, firſt, that S. Gregorie did not patronize their profeſſion in all theſe alledged particulars: ſecondly, that in manie of theſe he was an aduerſarie thereunto: thirdly, that there be many other Romiſh articles by them omitted, which S. Gregory did either renounce, or elſe not acknowledge. That theſe may appeare, we firſt deſcend into an en

                  SECT. 1.
                  1 Although we willingly confeſſe that S. Gregory was an happie father of the faith of manie, and deliuered to them the ſauing knowledge of Chriſt crucified: neuertheleſſe as ſome parents and nources with their milke, the food of life, do ordinarily transfuſe ſome inſenſible ſeeds of their owne hereditarie infirmities, which in time grow vpon their children, and become both ſenſible and dangerous, vnleſſe they be purged out: ſo it muſt be acknowledged of this ſpirituall father, that together with the ſubſtantiall doctrine of holy faith, his ſchollers and conuerts might receiue ſome few of his infirmities and ſuperſtitions; which, like hereditarie diſeaſes, increaſing with time, and growing ſtronger, ought not therefore to be ſtill cheriſhed, becauſe they are hereditary. We will begin with thoſe particulars, which they account moſt eſpeciall in Gods worſhip: a principall point herein is,

                     grant (as their owne learned Cardinall Bellarmine hath truly obſerued) that the Supper of the Lord may in diuerſe reſpects be called a Sacrifice. Vaine therefore is the purpoſe of theſe diſputers, who, from a difference onely about a word, labour to enforce a confirmation of a different doctrine. They ſhould rather haue examined their owne principles, publiſhed by their own learned Oblatio panis & vini, conſecrauonē praecedens, ad plenitudinem pertinet, non tamē ad eſſentiam ſacrificij. Bellarm. de Miſſa lib. 1. c. 27. prop 4. Oblatio quae ſequitur conſecrationem, ad integritatem Sacrificij ſimiliter pertinet, non ad eſſentiam Sacrificij. Ibid. prop. 5. Secundò, Chriſtus ipſe aut conſecrando & conſumendo ſacrificauit, aut nullo modo ſacrificauit: nam, vt oſtendimus, non eſt alia Chriſti actio, quae Sacrificium dici poſſit, neque ante neque poſt conſecrationem.

Cardinall; and vnderſtanding from him, that the eſſence of a ſacrifice conſiſteth not in oblations and offertures, whether before or after conſecration, but only in theſe two acts, viz. the conſecration of the elements by words, and participation of them by eating: they may

Yet this place is the onely ground of theſe our Apologiſts obiection concerning the teſtimonie of Doctor Humfrey, which proceeded not from his perſwaſion of the truth of that Storie, but from his ſuppoſition of the beliefe which the Romiſh profeſſors gaue thereunto: which (notwithſtanding diuerſe iudicious Doctors among them haue reiected it, as filthy, fooliſh, fabulous) hath bene preached in their Sermons, as being worthily graced

with the title of Golden, and is knowne to be generally embraced of their vulgar, as the true Acts and Monuments of holy Saints.

                     Chriſt doth ſuffer againe for vs in this myſterie. Chriſt ſuffer againe? this word is more then our Romaniſts will maintaine in the proper and literall ſignification, & therefore muſt be contented to expound that Chriſt is in the Euchariſt, ſo ſaid by S. Gregorie to haue bene ſacrificed, as he is ſaid therein to haue ſuffered: which is not by any corporall paſſion, but by a myſticall repreſentation. Which will appeare to haue bene the vniuerſal doctrine of the elder Church, when we come to conſult thereof with ancient Fathers.

How much more forcibly may we conclude from the ſuffrages and euidence of foure ſenſes, as ſmelling, ſeeing, handling, taſting, to proue that the bread after conſecration ſtill remaineth bread? Which kinde of reaſoning from naturall ſence in naturall obiects, being ſo vſed by Chriſt, muſt not (when it is likewiſe vrged by Proteſtants) be denied to be Chriſtian.
                  14 A ſecond reaſon we finde in S. Gregorie expounding the Angels ſpeech vnto the Diſciples, when they ſought Chriſt in the Sepulcher, ſaying, [He is riſen, and is not here] whereupon Surtexit, non eſt hic] Non eſt hic dicitur per praeſentiam carnis, qui tamen nuſquam deerat per praeſentiam maieſtatis. Greg.

                           mon Gloſſe, that it is meant in reſpect of a viſible preſence, becauſe here the natures are diſcerned by S. Gregorie in their eſſentiall, and not according to their accidentall properties: for the eſſentiall propertie of Diuinitie is to be euery where preſent.
                      
                     S. Gregorie thus: It was ſaid [he is not here] in reſpect of his bodily preſence, who according to his Diuine maieſtie was euery-where preſent: diſtinguiſhing two natures of Chriſt by their different and eſſentiall properties, humane nature not to be poſſibly preſent in many places at once, euen as it is impoſſible but the diuine nature ſhould be preſent euery-where. Which is more demonſtratiue by the words of S. Matthew; 
                     Matt. 28. 6. And whatſoeuer words our Aduerſaries obiect

                     He is not here, for he is riſen: by which particle [

                     , that is, for] a note of conſequence, we are taught, that if we ſhall thus argue [Chriſts humane nature, cannot be here and there in one inſtant, and therefore being properly in heauen, muſt not be fancied, in the ſame moment, to be corporally vpon earth] our concluſion muſt needs be found to be Angelicall.
                  15 Finally, what was the faith of our Church of England about thoſe times of S. Gregorie, may be obſerued by an ancient In the holie Font we ſee two things in that one creature: after the true nature, the water is corruptible water, and yet after ſpiritual myſterie, it hath hallowing might. So alſo if we be behold the holy houſell, it is bread, after bodily vnderſtanding, then we ſee that it is a bodie corruptible and mutable; but if we acknowledge therein a ſpirituall might, then vnderſtand we that life is therein, and it giueth immortalitie to them that eate it with beliefe. Much difference there is betweene the inuiſible might of the holy houſell▪ and the viſible ſhape of the proper nature. It is naturally corruptible bread, and corruptible wine, and it is by the might of Gods word truly Chriſts bodie and his bloud; not ſo, notwithſtanding, bodily, but ſpiritually. Much difference is there betweene the bodie that Chriſt ſuffered in, and the bodie that is hallowed to houſell; the bodie that Chriſt ſuffered in, was borne of the fleſh of Marie with bloud and with bone, with sk

                     confeſſion of this Purgatorie (ſaith Cardinall Bellarmine) is a part of Catholicke faith. Among many points often obiected by our Apologiſts, we finde this Article, omitted in other places, and therfore may challenge of vs a more preſent and exact diſcourſe, and firſt to examine,

Granting in effect, that if it cannot be euinced by Scripture, it may not be acknowledged as a doctrine neceſſarily to be beleeued of all men. Now our Aſſumption, to wit, that it is not demonſtrable by Scriptures, we may draw from an induction of the principall places of Canonicall Scriptures, from whence our Aduerſaries haue contended to prooue their imagined Article of Purgatorie, as namely, Pſal. 66. 12. Eſa. 9. 18. Mich. 7. 8. Mal. 3. 2. Matth. 5. 25. Matth. 5. 22. Luc. 16. 9. Act. 2. 24. 1. Cor. 3. 11. 1. Cor. 15. 1. Pet. 3. 19.

                      Doctors ſo exactly and particularly anſwered, that Proteſtants may well ſpare all paines of any further confutation of their proofes. From theſe two confeſſed premiſes it muſt follow, that this Article of their Purgatorie,

ſtanding ſo improbably vpon Scriptures, may be ſuſpected to be an exile from the doctrine of faith.
                  25 Some others finding ſo ſlipperie footing in Scripture for defence hereof, do next caſt anchor vpon preſumption of vnwritten traditions, hereditarily as it were deſcending vpon the Church by a lineall ſucceſſion from ancient Fathers.

                      certaine that theſe Reuelations are by the aboue named Authors as hiſtorically related, as they are wiſhed by this Ieſuit to be metaphorically interpreted: wherein we may perceiue a new doctrine concerning the reſidence of ſoules, diſcouered by the intelligence of walking ghoſts, whereunto Bede, Carthuſian, and S. Gregory yeeld a full aſſent; which notwithſtanding their Cardinall Bellarmine dare beleeue but onely in a probabilitie: their Ieſuit dare not beleeue them at all in the literall ſence.
                  35 What our Apologiſts would reſolue vpon this caſe, may be pertinently demaunded; for if they ſay that vnto S. Gregorie, as vnto the ſucceſſor of S. Peter, were the keyes of all the priſons of Purgatorie committed, and therfore his iudgement in the caſe of ſoules muſt be eſteemed infallible: how ſhall they excuſe theſe their owne Doctors, who haue either not fully beleeued, or elſe fully not beleeued ſuch conceits: but if they ſhall iuſtifie theſe their Authors, then may they not enuie in Proteſtants the like libertie of diſſenting from the opinion of S. Gregorie.

                     In the daies of ancient Fathers (ſaith their Ieſuit) there was a more ſtrict diſcipline vſed in the Church, when there was not ſo great need of Indulgences; but after that the heat of penance did decreaſe, the vſe of them grew frequent (to wit) after the daies of Lombard and Gratian, which was about 1200. years after Chriſt. This may ſatisfie for the diſcouerie of the noueltie of theſe Pardons. It will be no loſt labour to diſplay likewiſe

                     Some Catholicks (ſaith Cardinall Bellarmine) denie, that by Indulgences we haue freedome from puniſhment in reſpect of God, but yet I will proue (ſaith he) that they are deceiued. This is a fundamentall point in the queſtion of Romiſh Indulgences: and yet what ſecuritie is there in this doctrine, wherein their learned Doctors might be thus deceiued?
                  42 Next, becauſe Indulgence is in their doctrine a remiſſion of ſome acts of Penance, and cannot be applied without iuſt cauſe, we would know whether that Quaeſtio eſt an ad iuſtam cauſam (

                     Chriſt by ſuſtaining our puniſhment without our guilt, did cancell both our guilt and puniſhment,) is able alone to ouerthrow the whole frame of Indulgence towards the dead by the ſatisfactions of the liuing; becauſe the Romiſh foundation of this doctrine is onely to thinke, that Indulgentia eſt relaxatio poenae temporalis poſt remiſſam culpam debitae. Gregor. Valent. Ieſo
                      
                     God remitteth the guilt of ſuch as are in Purgatory, and yet exacteth of them a temporall puniſhment. Thus much concerning one mans ſatisfaction in behalfe of others.
                  48 But leſt our obiectors may by the word Satisfaction, intend alſo that Satisfaction which they will haue man after confeſſion to performe for himſelfe, not vnto man (which all Chriſtians do hold to be neceſſary) but vnto God: we are therefore againe to aduiſe with S. Gregorie, who indeed requireth that after man hath confeſſed his ſinnes, he ſhould Tertia ſpecies, id eſt, vindicta, quaſi medicina neceſſaria eſt, vt Apoſtema reatus quod conuerſione compungitur, confitendo purgetur, afflictioniſue medicina ſanetur: tum namque benè conuerſum peccatorem cernimus, dum digna afflictionis auſteritate delere nititur, quod loquendo confitetur.

                     take reuenge of himſelfe by penitentiall exerciſes: comparing the ſinfull condition of man to an impoſtume, in the cure whereof contrition and ſorow is the firſt pricking and lancing of the ſore; confeſsion of it is, as it were, the venting of the putrified corruption, and cleanſing of the wounds; and laſtly our reuenges taken vpon our ſelues, and voluntary ſatisfactions, our weeping, fasting, prayers, almes, are the meanes not onely of intreating pardon, but of eating out the dead fleſh, and the finall and perfect healing of the impoſtume, that it breake forth no more. All which do confirme not any legall, but onely a medicinall ſatisfaction, whereby the ſinner is better diſpoſed, and by repentance is made more capable of grace, but no meritorious cauſe thereof. Contrariwiſe their Cardinall Poſſumus aliquo modo ex proptijs & ad aequalitatem, ac per hoc iuſtè & ex cōdigno ſatisfacere. Bellar. lib 4. de Poenit. cap. 7. § Illud tamen. Bellarmine thus defineth: In ſome ſort (ſaith he) our owne act, whereby we may after ſatisfie according to the meaſure of equalitie, by the merit of condignitie. Which is a doctrine farre degenerate from the ancient faith of S. Gregorie, 
                     Iuſtus Aduocatus noſter iuſtos nos defendet in iudicio, quia noſmetipſos & cognoſcimus, & accuſamus iniuſtos. Non ergo in fletibus, non in actibus noſtris, ſed in Aduocati noſtri allegatione confidamus. Greg. in Ezec. homil. 7. in fine.

To conclude therefore, that although

the acts of repentance & mortification may be called Satisfactions, by way of complacency & acceptance by the grace and fauour of God, who delighteth in ſuch incenſe, the fruits of repentāce: yet are they ſo farre from the nature and vertue of condigne merite, and proper ſatisfaction, that not onely their owne

                     it vniuerſall (but onely) to equall it with the Sea of Rome. So that if that ſence which Cardinall Bellarmine feined, be admitted, Pope Boniface the third, and all the ſucceſſors of S. Gregorie, retaining the ſame title in the ſame or rather a worſe ſence, are by the iudgement of S. Gregory made conuincible of profane, ſacrilegious, and Antichristian impietie. But if the ſame ſence cannot conſiſt, then are our Aduerſaries left forlorne of all ſtrength of reſiſtance; becauſe to conceiue, that S. Gregory did onely in humilitie refuſe that title of vniuerſall Biſhop, which he himſelfe (as hath bene ſhewed) did abhorre in another, and renounce as neuer due either vnto his predeceſſors, or himſelfe, and in deteſtation therof called it impious & blaſphemous; to think (as our Aduerſaries haue anſwered) that he challenged and exerciſed the vniuerſall authoritie, power, and iuriſdiction, doth much derogate from the admirable worthineſſe and ſanctitie of S. Gregory: becauſe hereby they muſt note him (a thing very remarkable) to haue bene no ſyncere Paſtor, but a profane and ſubtle polititian, not vnlike vnto the firſt Caeſar, who in hiſtorie is noted to haue diſclaimed the title of a King, that thereby he might more plauſibly and popularly execute all monarchicall and kingly power and authoritie.
                  64 We might further adde another teſtimonie of S. Gregory, in whom we finde that iuriſdiction which he claimed, to be proportioned by the Imperiall Conſtitutions of Iuſtinian, denying any right of appeale vnto the Biſhop of Rome in any dioceſſe of other Biſhops, ouer which there was ſet any Patriarke: which Conſtitution S.

Which Gloſſe cannot proceed from any not forgetfull of the language of common courteſie: for if from the act of doing a man honour, may be concluded a dutie of ſubiection, it muſt follow from the ſame terme vſed both in Scripture, and in the ingraffed law of morality, that Let husbands giue honor vnto the woman, as vnto the weaker veſſel 1.

Wherefore many both before our daies, and now alſo, haue thought it more requiſite, that this law of ſingle life were diſpenced with, rather then to leaue open a window for men, contrarie to the law of God, to liue in ſinne: becauſe it is not to be doubted but that, by this licence of marriage, both concubinary fellowſhips may be aboliſhed, and the hatred of our Aduerſaries againſt the Cleargie remoued.

                  SECT. 38.
                  83 The ancient ſtate of the Monks, which eſpecially in the daies of the peace of the Church was a ſchoole of diſcipline, and ſeminarie of plants, prepared by reading the Scriptures, and praiers, with other exerciſes of learning & deuotion (leſt we may ſeeme to feine a Platonicall Idea of things) vnto the miniſterie of the Church, is that which (our Aduerſaries witneſſing as much) Ancients profeſſed, and 
                        See Bellar. lib. 2. de Monach. cap. 6. Proteſtants do now require: but this now Romiſh Monachiſine is wrapped in manyfold ſuperſtitions. Firſt is their attributing of perfection vnto that ſtate, becauſe of the vow of pouertie, grounded, as they ſay, vpon that ſaying of Chriſt vnto the young man, Math. 19. 21. 
                     If thou wilt be perfect, ſell all, and giue vnto the poore, and thou ſhalt haue treaſure in heauen. Which, if it be applied vnto vs, Ibi mandatam eſſe nobis paupertatē habitualem, non actualem, non vt iam omnia abjiciamus quae babemus, ſed vt cùm confeſſio diuini nomints & gloria Chriſti poſtulauerit, tù omnia deſerere parati ſimus. Guilielmas de Sancto A more, vt citat Hoſpinianus de Orig. Monach. lib. 6. c. 17. And it is alſo cited by Aquinas, opuſc. 19. 
                     doth not require alwaies (as their owne Doctor teacheth) an actuall, but an habituall relinquiſhing of worldly wealth: ſignifying a Chriſtian reſolution in euery one that ſhall hope for life, to be prepared alwaies rather to loſe all worldly wealth, then to forſake the profeſſion of his Ieſus, in whom onely he hath an intereſt vnto eternall life; like as the diſpoſition of a Merchant, who purpoſeth alwaies in danger of ſhipwracke rather to throw all his goods ouer-boord, then to hazard his deereſt life.

The vow of Chriſtian perfection, wherewith euerie baptized ſoule is bound, which hath ſacramentally giuen vp himſelfe vnto our captaine Chriſt Ieſus, is indeed alwaies to leaue the world, ſo that poſſeſſing it, we may be neuer poſſeſſed thereof: but the

point of Romiſh ſuperſtition, which accompanieth that vow, may ſeeme to be this, to call that a pouerty which indeed is a plentie: for what is it to want Proprium dicro

Gregorie to a multitude farre too heauie for the bodie of the Church to beare, will eaſily appeare vnto vs by due conference of former times. For firſt their Ieſuit Salmeron vndertaking to anſwer why in the primitiue Church there was verie few ceremonies, he ſo reaſoneth as though he had intended to preuaricate in his cauſe: Deinde primitiui magis eſſentialibus fides plantandis quam ceremonijs vacabant.

                     One reaſon was (ſaith he) becauſe in the primitiue Church there was not ſo many abuſes which might ſo neceſſarily require new lawes: another cauſe was, for that thoſe of the primitiue Church were more ſpirituall, and ſtronger in faith, and therefore needed not ſuch kind of inducements, as the Churches of after-times. And ſhall Proteſtants, becauſe they apply themſelues vnto the ſimplicitie of the Apoſtolike times in the fewneſſe of ceremonies, be therefore iudged leſſe ſpirituall?

Auguſt. epiſt 119. ad lanuar. cap. 19. Auguſtine (ſpeaking of his owne times) could ſay, that the Church is preſſed (contrary to Chriſts mercifull inſtitution) with ſuch ſeruile burthens of ceremonies, that the ſtate of the Iewes legall bondage might ſeeme in this reſpect more tolerable then the condition of Chriſtians, ſeeing they (the Iewes) were ſubiect onely to Gods ordinances, & not (as the then Chriſtians) ſubiect to ſo many preſumptions of mans inuentions. Can then our Aduerſaries thinke that the Church of Rome in the daies of S. Gregory, could be in a more tolerable caſe, which, coming 200. years after S. Auguſtines time, increaſed as much in the number of her rites, as of her yeares; whileſt euery Biſhop ſucceſſiuely deſiring that the Chriſtian Seruice might match both Iewes & Gentiles worſhip in her outward ſolemnities, aſſumed (as their Platina witneſſeth) an authoritie to adde ſome things to the outward ornaments and rites thereof?

Gregory; becauſe, indeed, all ordinances of man are, according to the wiſdome of Churches, variable and changeable.

This is that liberty which our Church of England, according to S. Gregorie his moderation, now challengeth, and by the mercie of God enioyeth, notwithſtanding the oppoſition of the Romiſh Church, which will peremptorily reigne as the onely Queene of Churches: for how will ſhe permit others to preferre the ordinances of any other Churches before her own, who would haue compelled the

                  14 What ſhall we ſtand vpon other fragments obiected? Our Chriſtian Reader may well vnderſtand, that our Authors in alledging ſo many particular ceremonies which were vſed in the time of S. Gregorie, do take exception vnto all, as being too many; not vnto euerie one, as in it ſelfe vnlawful or ſuperfluous; which in ſome of them hath bene alreadie declared. So be it likewiſe knowne vnto all our Aduerſaries, that the too many ceremonies vſed by S. Gregorie, cannot excuſe their now farre more multitudes; nor can ſome of his not good, iuſtifie their much worſe rites, and inuentiōs, as in the formerly ſpecified particulars hath appeared.

                     Gregorie exhorted a lay-man to the ſerious ſtudie of them, that thereby he might learne the will of God: alledging for his argument, that holy Scripture is the Epiſtle of God vnto his creature; prouing further, that Magnae vtilitatis eſt ipſa obſcuritas eloquiorum Dei, quia exercet ſenſum—vt exercitatus capiat quod capere nequit, ocioſus habeat quoque adhuc maius aliud; quia ſi in cunctis Scripturae ſacrae intelligentiae eſſet aperta, vileſceret, quae in quibuſdam locis obſcurioribus inuenta animum reficit.

                  5 But be it granted (for ſo it is) that the Papall Primacie, beginning in Boniface the third, is now 900 yeares old: yet is it true (by their owne confeſſion) that S. Gregorie preceding Boniface in that Chaire, did in himſelfe, and in the name of all his predeceſſors diſclaime, & deteſt the ſame 
                        See aboue cap. 2. §. 29. title of Romiſh Prelacie. So then truth being alwaies truth, and admitting no ſhadow of change by alteration or interruptions of time, our Aduerſaries for the gaining of 900 yeares of the continuance of Popedome ex facto, that is, by way of fact or euent, muſt neceſſarily yeeld vnto vs de iure, that is, by way of right, the truth of our cauſe from the antiquitie of 1500. 
                        That is the 900, from Boniface vnto theſe latter times, and 600 years before Boniface vnto Chriſt.
                      yeares: ſo damnifiable is the gaine which they ſo earneſtly haue ſought.
                  6 Their ſecond witneſſe (M. Napier) ſeemeth to them to deale more liberally, yeelding vnto them an interrupted preſcription of twelue hundred and ſixtie yeares, and that without any debatable contradiction. Which teſtimony, together with the next of M. Brocard, our aduerſaries haue repeated ſeuen ſeuerall times in this Apology, prouing them to be, as it were, the two Hercules his pillars, beyond which we may not paſſe. But this witneſſe (alas for the darkneſſe of iudgement of theſe Apologiſts) ſpeaketh not of the whole profeſſion of the Romiſh Church, but onely of one Article predominant therein, namely the doctrine of Popedome; neither yet do they abſolutely confeſſe this to haue bene, ſo long time, vndebatably ancient and vniuerſall. For M. 
                        M. Napier his owne words are as cleare as the day, to ſignifie that he doth not ſpeake in general of the whole body of the Romiſh faith, and of the vniuerſall antiquitie thereof, which is the point in queſtion; but onely of the firſt originall of the Papal dominion, and Antichriſtiā kingdome, as he calleth it: which he accordingly beginneth at that certaine yeare, in which imper

                  That the former argument vſed by the Apologiſts, and taken from the examples of remote Nations, is not onely not iudicious; but alſo (as is proued by the contradiction of their owne men) maruellouſly ridiculous.
                  SECT. 3.
                  13 We are not contented to haue made the incircumſpection of the Apologiſts viſible, but contend alſo (the cauſe enforcing vs hereunto) to make it, as it were, palpable vnto our Reader. And for a more plaine manifeſtation hereof, we repeat their argument; By the examples of remote Nations (ſay they) ſo farre diſtant one from another, conuerted doubtleſſe all of them in the Apoſtles times, and agreeing with vs in many principall points of faith, is not obſcurely ſignified, that the now Catholike (meaning Romiſh) Religion, is that primitiue faith, which the Apoſtles themſelues planted in all nations.
                  
                  14 This is the argument which theſe obiectors haue ſo vrgently preſſed, we haue partly confuted, and now further inſtance againſt them, and obiect the examples of Moſcouites, Aegyptians, Aethiopians, Armenians, and other ſuch like remote Nations, who all haue their publike praiers in their vulgar and knowne tongue. Herunto their Certum eſt, inquiunt (Proteſtantes) Ruthenos, & Aegyptios, Aethiopes, & Armenos & quoſdā alios celebrate diuina officia in lingua vulgari.—Reſpondemus, nos non permoueri Barbarorum exempli

Reſpondeo, exemplis Ruthenorum, Armenorum, & ſimilium non magis nos moueri, quám moueamur exemplis Lutheranorum, Anabaptiſtarum, & Caluiniſtarum. Sunt enim etiam illi vel haeretici, vel ſchiſmatici. Bollar. lib. 2 de Verbo Dei, cap. vlt. in fine. Theſe examples are obiected by Proteſtants, not ſo much to proue the neceſſitie of Prayer in a knowne tongue, which is ſufficiently proued by Scripture; as to ſatisfie their Aduerſaries demaunds, who commonly ſay, that except the three languages of Hebrue, Greeke, and Latine, the publike Seruice was not in common tongues of other nations: ſo that from the examples of ſuch remote nations the Apologiſts diſpute de iure, and Proteſtants rather de facto. Yet Bellarmins hath Luely recanted his former grant: Non omnino approbo hanc ſolutionem. Bellar. Recog. oper. pag. 5. 
                     Bellarmine, no leſſe diſdainfully; We are no more moued (ſaith he) with the examples of Moſcouites, Armenians, Aegyptians, and Aethiopians, then with the examples of Lutherans or Anabaptiſts; turning the argument which was vrged by the Apologiſts, for (as they haue pretended) no obſcure ſignification of a Catholike Religion, into a ſcorne and reproch, as reliſhing no better in their taſt then an humour barbarous, or Anabaptiſticall.
                  15 Whereby the diſcreet Reader may perceiue how fit men theſe Apologiſts be to challenge all Proteſtants vnto diſputation. But we leaue the examples of ſtrangers, & come, at our Aduerſaries call, vnto the examination of the iudgement of ancient Fathers.

Such is the partiall practiſe of our Aduerſaries in condemning Proteſtants of impudencie, for refuſing the teſtimonies, although but of a few; & yet will he haue it held a point of learning and wiſedome in themſelues, to reiect (as oft as they liſt) almoſt all.

This ſheweth that S. Chryſoſtome ſeemeth no more to teach that the proper nature of bread was changed into Chriſts body, then that the Miniſter, Man, is changed into a Seraphin, which is a ſpirit. And ſeeing no Aduerſary will ſay, that he vnderſtood Tranſubſtantiation of a man into a Seraphin: we may be inſtructed, that ſuch kind of ſpeeches are not vſed of Fathers in a proper and ſtrict ſence, but onely in a ſeeming reſemblance; as the ſequele of this diſcourſe will more plainly demonſtrate, after that we haue yeelded anſwers vnto the particular obiections: whereof the third followeth.

Tollet, doth iudge the literall ſence of them vnworthie of the name of Cyrill, or Hilary: our Aduerſaries are compellable to ſuffer vs to interpret ſuch ſentences according to a ſpirituall ſence. Finally, in all theſe ſentences of Cyrill, expreſſing onely the incorporation of Chriſt with vs, there is no one ſyllable obiected betokening the Tranſubstantiation of the bread into Chriſt. By this time we diſcerne the emptineſſe and vanitie of their third inſtance: now they flie vnto S. Cyprian.

Bellar. lib. 2. de Euchar. cap. 9. to doubt whether this be the Sermon of Cyprian, or elſe of ſome ancient Author: which giueth vs cauſe at leaſt to ſuſpect it for a counterfeit. Neuertheleſſe if we (for diſputation ſake) ſhall admit this his petition, to thinke that it is the worke of an Author verie ancient: yet cannot our Apologiſts proue from Vrſinus any more then a ſeeming affirmation of Tranſubſtantiation.

If now we ſhould take the liberty practiſed by theſe Apologiſts, might we not hereupon conclude as frō a confeſſion of Cardinall Bellarmine, that Auguſtine, Theodoret, and other ancients haue fauoured the doctrine of Proteſtants, and confuted the Romiſh Article of Tranſubstantiation?

Here another cunning of the Romaniſts bewraieth it ſelfe. For the Apologiſts contend to proue the doctrine of Proteſtants, in this point, to haue bene noted by Theodoret, that therby they may be made a-kin vnto old heretiks: which accuſation their owne Cardinall Bellarmine will not allow, leſt that this opinion may take vpon it the name of ancient.
                  
                  20 Againe, the purpoſe of the Apologiſts was, hereby to proue their Tranſubſtantiation in the Euchariſt: but their Cardinall doth anſwer, that the ſentence concerneth the myſterie of Chriſts incarnation. So that the iudgement of the Apologizers may ſeeme ſtill to loſe in weight, the rather becauſe Theodoret (as b will be now proued) was a reſolute and profeſſed aduerſarie vnto their Tranſubſtantiated manner of preſence.

                  SECT. 9.
                  21 That the opinion of Tranſubſtantiation, was (but not in the Fathers) verie ancient, we cannot but confeſſe; for we find that Theodoret maketh his Eraniſtes, an hereticall partie, to bolt it our, whom he therefore orthodoxally, and (that I may ſo ſay) Proteſtantly confuteth, yet as being then onely a priuate opinion; which (as our obiected Author ſaid truly) irrepſit, ſignifying, that it was yet but a creeper. For not till a thouſand yeares after, it came to that growth, as from an opinion to waxe ſo big as a doctrine of faith, and of a priuate to become generall.
                  22 Thus haue we anſwered their particular obiections, wherein they haue impoſed vpon vs a credulitie of an imagined Gregory, a forged Euſebius Emiſſenus, a counterfeit Cyprian, beſides the ſeeming teſtimonie of Chryſoſtome, the impertinent ſentence of Ambroſe, the peruerted ſence of Theodoret. Notwithſtanding we do not maruell hereat, knowing that forged doctrines muſt need the ſupport of feined ſuffragies. It now remaineth after that we haue warded off their violence, we ſhould trie our force in replie, and ſhew,
                     That the Romaniſts are conſtrained to reiect ſome teſtimonies of antiquitie, as contradictorie to their doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation.

                     ſince, called in queſtion the Romiſh manner of Chriſts preſence in the Sacrament. It is notable to ſee how well they haue practiſed their artificiall ſhift vpon this Author, commaunding his word [Fol. 1137. Legendum [Inuiſibiliter] pro, viſibiliter. Et infra verſ. 36.

How inconſiderate therefore haue our Apologiſts bene in this part of their challenge, wherein (by ſo many exceptions taken againſt antiquitie by their owne men) they are catched in their owne ſnare, and are become irreconcilably aduerſaries to their owne cauſe?
                  35 This queſtion of Tranſubſtantiation being of ſo great conſequence, that if it be defenſible, Proteſtants muſt ſtand chargeable of hereſie; but if it may be cōfuted, the Romaniſts muſt neceſſarily be condemned of Idolatry: we thinke it our bounden dutie to conſult more exactly with the Senate of antiquitie, and to make euident

                  SECT. 14.
                  36 We can neuer rightly apprehend mens conceits, before we truly learne their language: for if we catch onely at the ſyllables of the Fathers ſentences, and do not directly vnderſtand the Idiome and propriety of their ſpeech, but dwell vpon the ſound, and not vpon the ſence thereof; how ſhall we, children know our Fathers doctrines? how ſhall we not by our ignorance of their tongues build vp ſome towers of Babiloniſh and confuſed conceits, ſuch as we take the Romiſh Article of Tranſubſtantiation to be? Wherefore we muſt firſt endeuour to learne diſtinctly the ſignification of our Fathers voices, which any Reader, although but of meane capacitie, may eaſily apprehend by that which ſhall be deliuered. Now then
               
               
                  The first argument, of diſcerning of the language of ancient Fathers in the queſtion of this Sacrament, is taken from the analogie or like tenour of ſpeech vſed by them in the Sacrament of Baptiſme.

                      Aduerſaries catch at the words of Fathers concerning the Euchariſt, eſpecially where they find any termes ſpecifying, 1. that it is not to be looked vpon as bare bread and wine, 2. that it is changed into another thing or nature not ſeene, 3. that the working of grace therein is ineffable: 4. that herein there is a miraculous operation: 5. that Chriſts bloud is ſaid to be in this Sacrament, and we hereby to eate his fleſh: 6 that the matter is to be worſhipped. By euerie which kind of obſeruation they vſe to vnderprop their imagined Tranſubſtantiation, not ſuffering (alas) their Reader to vnderſtand, that the ſame Fathers vſe the ſame ſpeeches concerning the Sacrament of Baptiſme: wherein both they and we know and profeſſe, that the water after conſecration continueth in the ſame ſubſtance of water.

The new doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation openeth a wide gap vnto thoſe ancient hereſies, as is more fully proued by the weakneſſe of the anſwer of our greateſt Argumen

Before we enter into particulars, let this be obſerued for a generall Principle, which hath in it all the rules of a Maxime or Principle

                     , &c. & is approued of all men of whatſoeuer opinion in the world: to wit, There cannot poſſibly be any truth in any doctrine, which containeth in it a contradiction.
                  
                  67 Firſt then their Thomas in 4. diſt. 44. q. 2. art. 2 & quidam alij Catholici exiſtimant, non poſſe vnum corpus eſſe in duobus locis localiter, ſed tantùm ſacramentaliter.—Et rationem hanc reddunt, quia vnum eſt illud quod eſt indiuiſum à ſe, & diuiſum à quocunque alio, ex quibus conditionibus prior, indiuiſum iſe, eſſentialis & inſeparabilis, altera non. 
                     Aquinas (beſides other Catholicks) a Doctor ſometime eſteemed of our Aduerſaries as the Oracle of the Romiſh Schoole, whom for his profound learning, and ſearch into the myſteries of all Diuinitie, they ſirnamed Seraphical; he from an argument of contradiction did concluſiuely reſolue, that it is abſolutely impoſſible for one bodie to be at the ſame time locally in many places at once: whence it muſt follow (by the iudgement of Cardinall Sed haec ratio, pace tanti Doctoris dixerim, non eſt ſolida; nam duplex eſt indiuiſio à ſe:—vna reſpectu loci, quae extrinſeca eſt, & plane accidentaria; alia reſpectu rei ipſius, quae eſt intrinſeca, & vel eſt de eſſentia, vel certè proprietas quaedam vnitatis.—Cùm vnum corpus eſt in diuerſis locis, non tollitur indiuiſio intrinſeca, ſed ſolùm extrinſeca, reſpectu loci: nam non diuiduntur principia intrinſeca, quae corpus conſtituunt, ſed ſolùm diuiduntur ſitus, ſiue vbi illius corporis. Which anſwer is very vnſufficient, becauſe that this diuiſion doth not reſpect diuerſa vbi: for the ſame body in his diuers members is in diuers places at once: but by the Ieſuits doctrine the ſame bodie is feined to be on one altar, and on a ſecond, but yet not in the place of diſtance betweene them both. In this, not being, conſiſteth the diuiſion, which doth as neceſſarily proue diuerſa vbitata. as diuerſa vbi. But we come to his next confutation of Thomas: Quod ſi non poſſet eſſe vnum corpus localiter in duobus locis, quia diuideretur à ſeipſo (as Thomas held,) profectò nec poſſit eſſe ſacramentaliter, eadem ratione; licet enim eſſe alicubi ſacramentaliter non dicat eſſe per loci occupationem, tamen dicit eſſe per realem & veram praeſentiam, quae realis praeſentia in tot hoſtijs, ſiue Altaribus, & non in locis intermedijs, non minus tollere videtur indiuiſionem rei, quàm repletionem plutium locorum. Bellarm. lib. 3. de Euchariſt. cap. 3. §. Quidam tamen. See Thomas, part. 3. Summ. qu. 76. Bellarmine,) that it cannot poſsibly be ſacramentally in diuerſe places at once. Where we may note, that as Aquinas, their ancient Bellarmine, hath giuen vs our antecedent, viz. no bodie can poſsibly be locally in two places at one time; ſo Bellarmine, their preſent Aquinas, hath granted vs our conſequent, viz. that it muſt follow vpon that impoſsibilitie, that there can be no Tranſubſtantiation, or being of Chriſts bodily preſence, no not (as the Romaniſts vnderſtand it) ſacramentally, becauſe of a contradiction.
                  68 And when their two moſt famous Ieſuits contend to ſhew a poſſibilitie of the preſence of Chriſts bodie in many hoſts, and places at once, then they ſtraine their voices

                  A ninth argument of ſafetie in the Protestants defence; becauſe although they beleeue not Tranſubſtantiation, yet notwithstanding do they receiue the bodie of Chriſt more really and truly in the Sacrament of the Euchariſt: by many reaſons, whereof ſome are deduced from the teſtimonies of our Aduerſaries.
                  SECT. 26.
                  86 More then erroneous is that cenſure which our Aduerſaries haue paſſed vpon Proteſtant Churches, in regard of their Euchariſt; one Chriſtus nouus (meaning of Proteſtants) illis nihil niſi ſtruſtū panis eſt, & vini portiun

Greg. Valent. Ieſ. and others. See aboue.
                      
                     that (as their own Ieſuit acknowledgeth) although Chriſt be corporally in heauen, yet is he receiued of the faithful communicants in this Sacrament truly, both ſpiritually by the mouth of the mind, through a moſt neare coniunction of Chriſt with the ſoule of the receiuer by faith, and alſo ſacramentally with the bodily mouth, receiuing not Chriſt, (meaning, Intelligit Caluinus, nō per localem praeſentiam, ſed per quandam communicationem. Bellar. lib. 1. de Euchariſt. cap. 10. §. Eſt autem. 
                     not Chriſt according to his locall preſence,) but bread and wine, as ſeales and ſignes of the promiſe of redemption in his bodie and bloud.

                     A Sacrament (ſaith S. Bernard) is a ſacred ſigne or myſterie, as may be explaned by a common example: for if I giue a ring, then hath it no ſignification; but if I giue a ring, thereby to inueſt a man in the right of ſome inheritance, it is now both a ring and a ſigne: ſo that he that receiueth it may ſay, the ring is of no worth, but the inheritance is the thing that I ſought.
                  
                  93 We now demaund of our Aduerſaries, when a Biſhop is inueſted in his Biſhopricke, by receiuing the Popes Palle; or any man made heire of any portion of land by the gift of a ring, or (if they will) of a ruſh receiued from the true and faithfull doner thereof: whether theſe are thereby truly and really intereſſed in thoſe gifts, although in reſpect of place they be a thouſand miles diſtant? or will the parties contemne ſuch pretious gifts, becauſe the matter of conueiance is but a ruſh? So in this Sacrament the doner is Chriſt, the gift is his precious bodie and bloud, the high ranſome of mans redemption, conueied vnto man-kind by the word and Sacrament, as by a viſible deed of gift vnder the ſignes and ſeales of common elements of bread and wine, conſecrated to that vſe; the right receiuer is the penitent and faithfull communicant.
                  94 This ſimilitude agreeth for the manner, albeit for the effectualneſſe

of the manner we ſay, that the ods is no leſſe then heauen and earth. For by this faithfull participation, there is wrought in the godly Chriſtian an ineffable and incomprehenſible vnion & coniunction through faith, with the humanitie of Chriſt his redeemer; whereby he is alſo made* partaker of the diuine nature, by the power whereof he is ſanctified in his bodie, and ſhall be immortalized in the reſurrection of the iuſt, in that kingdome which ourhead Chriſt doth now bodily poſſeſſe. And if the receipts of worldly poſſeſſions conueied vnto man by ſuch politicke inſtruments, and (that I may ſo ſpeake) ſacraments, as ſignes and feales ordained by men for the ratification of their grants, are held Real, which notwithſtanding vaniſh in mortalitie: how much more reall is the gift & receipt of that benefit, which exhibited vnto vs in corporall elements, hath the doner Chriſt, who is the eternall ſonne of God; the gift, his precious and glorious bodie, which is the euerlaſting ranſome of his elect, and is receiued by faith (which is the peculiar gift of the holy Ghoſt,) into the ſoules of the faithfull, which are the immortall ſpirits of his election.

So that the ſtate of the queſtion, being D. Fulke did not otherwiſe condemne reſeruation, then when the right end, which is participation, is neglected. ſtrictly examined, is not ſo much whether, as wherefore this Sacrament may be reſerued.

The Romaniſts reſerue it for ends by them newly deuiſed. It now belongeth vnto vs to diſcuſſe this queſtion with that combination of breuity and perſpicuitie, which we haue alwaies intended.

                     Becauſe of the imminent dangers in the daies of hote perſecution of the Church, (ſaith their owne Durantus) the faithfull could not fitly or freely aſſemble to the participation of the Sacrament; therefore they ſometime tooke the Euchariſt, and carried it home to their owne houſes, and ſo to others who were detained by neceſsitie. And we doubt not but the Sacraments publikely conſecrated by Gods miniſter, and ſent from the table of the Lord to faithfull Chriſtians, who (although they be abſent in bodie, yet are preſent in ſpirit,) do equiualently communicate; becauſe the Euchariſt which is reſerued vnto this end, is alſo preſerued in the ſanctified vſe of taking and cating, ordained in the firſt inſtitution, eſpecially being thus priuiledged by neceſſitie, through ſickneſſe or perſecution, or ſuch like extremitie.

For the Armenians were not iudged hereticks for not mixing water with wine in the Euchariſt, but onely for their reaſon of not mixing, which was hereticall.

                     Manichees did heretically celebrate the Euchariſt onely in one kind, the bread, but the wine they did not allow, becauſe they imagined wine to haue bene created by an euill ſpirit; and were therefore anciently condemned

for hereticks. Would now the Apologiſts hold it conſcionable in Proteſtants to accuſe the Romaniſts of that hereſie of the Manichees, becauſe they diſtribute not the Euchariſt in both the elements, bread and wine? Nay, would they not rather reiect this accuſation as altogether iniurious, ſaying, it was not the Manichees abſtinence from the wine, but the reaſon of that forbearance which was iudged hereticall? Yet ſo friuolous and vncircumſpect haue the Apologiſts bene, that they cannot reckon Proteſtants among the Armenians, except they wil likewiſe impound their owne Romaniſts among the Manichees. And this might ſerue for an anſwer vnto their next inſtance, which followeth.

                     milke in ſtead of wine, & wringing in of the grape, and ſopping of the bread, as contrarie to the Euangelical truth, and Eccleſiaſticall cuſtome: which (ſaith he) is eaſily proued from the ſentence
                     
                     of truth, (meaning Chriſt) from whom theſe Sacraments proceeded. For when as Chriſt did commend this Sacrament vnto his Diſciples, he gaue not milk, but onely bread and wine; for we reade in the Euangeliſts, [Ieſus tooke bread, & the Cup, &c.] So manifeſt & euident is the example of truth. Neither do we find in the Goſpel that he ſopped in the bread, for he commended the bread and Chalice ſeuerally vnto them. Therefore muſt our Aduerſaries thinke Proteſtants not pardonable onely, but alſo commendable, if they vſe the ſame reaſon againſt the mixture of water, which their Pope Iulius hath enforced againſt mingling of bread: euen becauſe they are not agreeable vnto the expreſſe forme of the firſt inſtitution deliuered in the Goſpell.
                  12 Againe, this Sacrament is a type and ſigne of Chriſts death, wherein as is confeſſed, the Dicendum eſt ſine dubio, in paſſione Chriſti ſanguinem & aquam impermixtam exiuiſſe, & loco ſeparata, tum quia haec ſignificant verba Iohannis. tum etiam quia non potuiſſet aliter ſanguis ab aqua diſcerni Suarez Ieſ. in Thom. 3. q. 51.

                     bloud and water iſſuing from the ſide of Christ, were diſcernably distinct & ſeparated: which therfore S.

                      Auguſtine calleth the fountains of two diſtinct Sacraments, water in Baptiſme, and wine in the Euchariſt. For otherwiſe to applie water and wine, in one mixture, to this one Sacrrment of the Euchariſt, is a great incongruitie and vnlikelineſſe: becauſe theſe ſignes, wine and water mingled in this Sacrament, can no more giue a true repreſentation of bloud and water, which were diſcernably ſeuered in Chriſts paſſion, than mixtion can betoken a ſeparation.
                  
                  13 Furthermore, in Melchizedechs action, which our Aduerſaries do thinke to be a figure of this Euchariſticall ſacrifice, we reade onely of Euch ariſtia figurata erat in vino, quod cum pane protulit Melchizedech. Bellarm. lib. 4. de Euchar. cap. 1

For we can ſhew,
               
               
                  That the opinions of the Fathers in their expoſitions of prophecies, which were to be fulfilled after their times, may be refuſed, without any derogation from their iudgement in other doctrines: which is proued by the confeſsions of our learned Aduerſaries.

Peter, and inferre that euerie Pope is ſucceſſiuely that Rocke and Vicar of Chriſt. By which contradiction taken from the ſame particle [the,] our Aduerſaries are cōpellable either to grant an Antichriſt by ſucceſsion, or elſe to deny a ſuceſſion in Popedome.

                     Thou art [the] golden head, that is, (as their owne Author confeſſeth) thy kingdome; where, in the name of but one, the ſucceſſion of all the Emperours of Babylon is compriſed.
                  13 Hitherto therefore it doth not appeare, but as when we ſay, the Turk is the Tyrant of the Eaſt, or when they affirme, that the Pope is the vniuerſall Biſhop of the Weſt, that neither we in the name Turke (a word of the ſingular number,) nor they in the name Pope, do vnderſtand any ſingular one Turke a tyrant, or any Pope a ſupreme Biſhop, but the ſucceſſiue hierarchie and monarchie in both. So by the ſingular name of Antichriſt may be interpreted a collectiue or ſucceſſiue gouernment of many ſingular perſons, who (as diuerſe members make one perfect and conſummate bodie) do exerciſe one and the ſame Antichriſtian iuriſdiction: concerning which, the next queſtion will be,

                  20 The onely Cities that are found in Authors to be the deſtinate ſeats of Antichriſt, are but theſe two, Hieruſalem and Rome: now therefore ſeeing Hieruſalem, which they ſet in our light, is thus remoued, we may more eaſily ſee Rome, which, in the iudgement of Proteſtants, is Antichriſts proper ſeat. This opinion is grounded vpon that Scripture Reuel. 17. 19. wherein the throne of the whore is deſcribed by ſeuen mountaines, whereon the woman ſitteth; and is further particularized by the name of Babylon the great. Reuel. 18. 2. Hereupon Proteſtants haue made bold to inſtile Rome the ſeate of Antichriſt, and not onely that old Rome in the daies of the heatheniſh perſecuting Emperours, but Rome as it is to be conſidered in the later ages of the world: and are for ſo expounding theſe Scriptures, noted by the The Heretiks blinded with extreme malice againſt ye church of Rome, interprete the ſeuen hills, Apoc. 17. literally, to perſwade the ſimple that Rome is the ſeate of Antichriſt.

Secundò in. artificiall Altar; howſoeuer, we cannot diſlike the ſentence of Doctor Reynolds, concerning the mutuall relation and dependance betweene an Altar and a Sacrifice: but grant that Altar doth as naturally and neceſſarily inferre a Sacrifice, as a ſhrine doth a Saint, a father a ſonne: yet ſo, as to diſtinguiſh when theſe things are properly, & whē improperly ſo called; knowing that the table of the Lord being called improperly an Altar, can no more conclude a Sacrifice properly vnderſtood, then when as S. Paul calleth Titus his ſonne according to the faith (which is improperly) a man may contend that S. Paul was his proper and naturall Father, which is, according to the fleſh. Therefore hath their Cardinall Bellarmine ſaid truly, viz. Sacrificium & ſacerdotium relata ſunt, it a vt propriè dictum ſacerdotium propriè dicto ſacrificio reſponde at.

                  SECT. 5.
                  9 After the contention about the word Sacrifice, which in reſpect of the ſuperſtitious apprehenſion of corrupter times hath bene iudged dangerous and incommodious: we deſcend to the queſtion of doctrine, concerning

the true nature of a Sacrifice; which is by the Romaniſts in their Councell of I rent propounded as a doctrine of faith, and is by them defined to be Sacrificium eſt verè propitiatorium. Et▪

                     the ſame ſacrifice truly propitiatorie, now offered by the miniſterie of the Prieſt, which was offered by Chriſt himſelfe vpon the Croſſe:

                     So fully the ſame (ſaith their Cardinall,) that as the ſubstance of Chriſt which is really in the Hoſt, differeth not from the ſubſtance of his bodie in heauen: ſo the immolation and ſacrificing of him in the formes of bread, and his ſacrificing vpon the Croſſe is the verie ſame. But, Proteſtants (ſaith the ſame our greateſt Aduerſarie) although they allow this to be a ſacrifice of thankſgiuing, and of diuine worſhip of God; yet do they not eſteeme it to haue the proper nature of a Sacrifice, but to be ſo called after a large and vnproper manner of ſpeech: in the which large acception Proteſtants may account it propitiatorie alſo. So that the controuerſie is onely concerning the proper and improper ſignification of termes, and compriſeth two queſtions: firſt, whether the Euchariſt be a true eſſentiall ſacrifice; ſecondly, whether it be properly propitiatorie, and auailable in it ſelfe for remiſſion of ſinnes, or no. Both which, we wiſh, may be decided by the verdict of ancient Fathers, by the tenor of Chriſts inſtitution, & by the principles of the Romiſh Church, and in euerie of theſe by the confeſſions of our learned Aduerſaries. c Tria ſunt genera ſacrificiorum: vnum in Scripturis dicit

                     then of Baptiſme: but the Fathers (ſaith he) neuer call Baptiſme a ſacrifice, or ſay, that to baptize is to ſacrifice. And concludeth hereupon, that the word ſacrifice was vſed of the Fathers in a proper and literall ſence: whereby he doth not obſcurely grant, that the vſe of the word ſacrifice, attributed by the ancient Fathers vnto the Euchariſt, might indeed be interpreted as taken metaphorically and vnproperly, if it could be once ſhewed, that the ſame Fathers applied the ſame word ſacrifice vnto the Sacrament of Baptiſme: otherwiſe their leſuite Suarez would not ſo vrgently haue moued his Reader principally to In multis Concilijs, vt in Toletano, Brachorenſi, Laodicen. vocatur incruentum ſacrificium.—Solum eſt obſeruandū propter haereticos, qui hic etiā detorquent ad metaphoram nomen Sacrificium; Sanctos Patres nun quam vocáſſe miniſterium Baptiſmi, aut alterius Sacramenti nomine Sacrificij; cum tamen Sacrificium metaphoricè ſumptum in

                     obſerue againſt hereticks (ſo he calleth Proteſtants,) that the holy Fathers of ancient times did neuer call the miniſterie of Baptiſme by the name of a ſacrifice, although metaphorically it might be ſo termed. Therefore (ſaith he) it is a ſigne, that when they often call the Eucharist a ſacrifice, they name it ſo properly.

                     dying vpon the Croſſe, was offered himſelf, and is ſacrificed daily in this Sacrament, becauſe in this Sacrament there is a commemoration of that ſacrifice of the Croſſe, which was once offered. Could it haue ſtood with the learning of ſo great a moderator of their ancient Schoole, and ſo ſubtle a ſearcher into all the articles of the Romiſh faith, to haue left vndecided this point of reall ſacrificing of Chriſt, the principall part of their now Prieſthood and worſhip, if he had then beleeued that any part of the Maſſe were to be eſteemed a proper and an eſſentiall ſacrifice? Hitherto haue we intreated of the firſt queſtion, ſhewing that in the Maſſe there is no proper ſacrifice: now come we to the ſecond queſtion, and prooue
               
               
                  
                     That the ſacrifice of the Maſſe cannot be accounted truly propitiatorie: which the conſequents of our Aduerſaries do euidently enforce: Firſt from their preſcribed manner of Sacrifice.
                  
                  SECT. 12.
                  45 Although this be an vndoubted conſequence, to wit, that it cannot be called properly a ſacrifice propitiatorie, which is proued not to be properly a ſacrifice, in ſo much that the concluſion of the former queſtion might giue a ſuperſedeas vnto the ſecond: yet the importunitie of the Apologiſts may ſeeme to challenge of vs a proofe of this ſecond concluſion: which we are readie to performe by arguments taken from the manner, the cauſe efficient, the end, and the effect of a ſacrifice properly called propitiatorie.
                  
                  46 In the manner of this ſacrifice there is to be required a deſtruction of the thing ſacrificed, and that this deſtruction be bloudy, & that this bloud be by death, and that this death, and bloud, and all be ſenſible and viſible. Of the firſt point their Cardinall Bellarmine ſayeth, Adverum ſacrificium requiritur vt quod offertur Deo in ſacrificium, planè deſtruatur, id eſt ita mutetur vt deſinat eſſe id quod erat: & in hoc differt à ſim plici oblatione, quae interdum ritu myſtico ele

Bellarm. lib. 1. de Miſſa, cap. 2. §. Octauo. Verum & reale ſacrificium veram & realem mortem aut deſtructionem rei immolatae deſiderat. Ibid. lib. 1. cap. vlt. §. Haec ſententia: & §. Quod autem. 
                     In euerie true ſacrifice which is offered vnto God, the thing that is ſacrificed muſt ſuffer deſtruction, euen in the verie ſubstance thereof, ſo that it ceaſſe to be that which it was before. Which aſſertion is true, eſpecially in all propitiatorie ſacrifices, this kind indeed did alwaies ſuffer a deſtruction, and that by * ſhedding of bloud, and was therein a figure of that perfect ſacrifice of Chriſt vpon the Croſſe, wherin his bodie did ſuſtaine a deſtruction, for mans propitiation. But can this reall deſtruction be affirmed of Chriſt his bodie in the Maſſe without impietie? Their Cardinall Bellarmine ſaith, Conſumptio ſeu manducatio, quae fit à Sacerdote, quòd ſit pars eſſentia

                     A reall destructiō is indeed an eſſentiall point of a ſacrifice: and in the Maſſe the Prieſts eating is the conſumption of this ſacrifice; yet are not our Aduerſaries ſo vtterly forlorne of diuine light, as to vnderſtand ſuch a reall deſtruction of our Lords bodie by the Prieſts eating, that it ceaſſeth to be in ſubſtance that which it was before: no,

Tertió, is onely his owne figment, and contradicteth the examples of the old law (which all were naturally conſumed, and the Archetypon of all ſacrifices, Chriſt, whoſe naturall bodie was wounded vnto death) and his owne grant, ſaying, The ſubſtance of the ſacrifice muſt ſuffer deſtruction. they rather chooſe to ſay, that not Chriſt, but the formes of bread and wine are the things which are torne and conſumed with the teeth, and that the bodie of Christ doth not ſuſtaine any diminution.

And yet theſe ſame doctrines were long ſince defended with almoſt as large conſent, as was their Limbus. Therefore ought not the exceptions vſed by Proteſtants, to be condemned, before that their arguments may be confuted; which are three, viz. oppoſition of Fathers, Scriptures, and Reaſons. Of all which in order: and firſt

                  5 That the ſoules of Abraham, and of the Patriarchs, Prophets, and other holy ſeruants of God before Chriſts death, remained not ſo much as in ſome outward court of heauen, or place of ioy, but (which is the now Romiſh doctrine) in a part of hell, euen in a lake wherein is no water, that is, no comfort, vntill Chriſt by his deſcending thither, did bring a generall Iubilee,

                  8 Let our Aduerſaries limite the borders of hell according vnto their owne fancies; ſure we are that the place which the Scripture calleth hell, is noted to be diſtinct from Abrahams boſome by a

                  SECT. 8.
                  17 Firſt, from the due examination of the teſtimonies of antiquity, we conclude that the Romiſh doctrine of Limbus was not Catholike, becauſe it was repugnant vnto the iudgement of many ancient §. 4. Fathers. 2. From the ſearch of diuine authority, we conclude that it is no doctrine of faith, §. 5. becauſe it ſtandeth not vpon holy Scripture the foundation of faith. 3. From the triall by reaſons we cōclude, that the Proteſtants profeſſe ſo much more gracious & glorious a deliuerance of the ſoules of Patriarchs by the power of Chriſts death, then do the Romaniſts, by how much more excellent a bleſſing it is to be freed from euer coming into a priſon, then after ſome long endurance to be deliuered from thence. And laſtly, from the practiſe of our Aduerſaries we conclude, that they are no competent challengers of antiquitie in this caſe of Limbus Patrum, who are guiltie of ſuch noueltie in faining and teaching a §. 6.

                     IT ſeemeth vnto vs a thing vnreaſonable in theſe obiectors, to charge vs to ſatisfie for the ſayings of A man ſchiſmatically deuided from our Church, and a contemner of the verdict of antiquitie.

                  2 The cenſure which the iudicious Proteſtants haue paſſed vpon ancient Authors, is not an vniuerſall taxation of all, but yet of many. Now if the Apologiſts had not in this their oppoſition rather affected (as may be feared) ſeducement then iudgement, they might haue taught their Reader Chryſoſtom' impetu dicendi contra Manichaeos, qui fati neceſſitatem defendebant, naturae vires plus aequo attollit.

And in this, and other doctrines of affinitie therewith, did ſeeme to haue inclined contrarie vnto Scripture, vnto the error of the Pelagians. Wherein we eaſily perceiue with what preiudice the Apologiſts haue bene tranſported thus to traduce Proteſtants as being iniurious in that taxation, wherein, by the iudgement of their owne Ieſuits, they ſtand iuſtifiable vnto euerie conſcience of man.

                  9 And our Aduerſaries would haue their Readers further to vnderſtand, that the queſtion concerneth not the wil of a man, as he ſtandeth in the ſtate of grace, but as he is now to be conuerted from ſinne vnto repentance: for of them that are in the ſtate of iuſtification, the Cooperamur Deo non ſolum, vt Aduerſarij volunt, poſt iuſtificationem; ſed etiam in ipſa iuſtificatione & initio fidei.—Non, niſi cooperantibus nobis, Deus gratiam noſtram operatur.

                     It is queſtioned (ſaith their Cardinall) whether will be a facultie actiue or paſsiue: and he reſolueth, that it is ſimply actiue:

                     becauſe (ſaith he) if it were paſsiue, it could not be free. Shewing that for defending of that freedome of will (which by their Councell of Trent is found to conſiſt in an indifferencie

                     of conſenting or not conſenting to any ſpirituall good,) it is neceſſarie that the nature of will be acknowledged to be ſimply actiue, and not paſſiue: otherwiſe it cannot be iudged to be ſimply free. But many ancient profeſſors in their Romiſh Schooles, as namely Tres ſunt de hac re Theologorum ſententiae; prima eſt eorum, qui humanam voluntatem paſtiuam potentiam eſſe volunt, ac docent actum voluntatis produci actiuè à phantaſmate, vel ab obiecto cognito, vel certe ab ipſa mente apprehendence & iudicante obiectum.

And therefore all theſe their own Doctors do neceſſarily, by a confeſſed conſequence, ouerthrow the Romiſh doctrine of mans will in his firſt conuerſion vnto grace.
                  11 A ſecond confeſſed conſequence, whereby the Romiſh freedome of will is ſubuerted, is taken from the efficacie of Gods ſpirit, in determinating or neceſſitating mans will. For Si Deus eſſet agens neceſſarium, & determinaret voluntatem humanam, illa non liberè, ſed neceſſariò ageret, vt Aduerſarij admittunt.—Nam ſi nos admittamus, ita determinari voluntatem humanam à Deo, vt non poſſit agere, niſi id, ad quod à Deo determinatur, & tamen quia Deus eam liberè determinat. & ipſa voluntariè & cum pleno iudicio rationis agit: contendamus hominem eſſe liberi arbitrij. tota controuerſia inter nos & haereticos erit de nomine.

                     if (ſaith Cardinall Bellarmine) God doth determine mans will, that is, ſo moueth it that it cannot but follow the inſpiration, then haue we no reaſon (ſaith he) to contend any longer with Proteſtants concerning the liberty of the will of man. Why? Quo ſupra.

                     The election of the will doth neceſſarily depend vpon the last iudgement of reaſon, by which it is neceſſarily determined, as that after all things are conſidered, in the end, by the laſt act of reaſon, ſaying, [this muſt be done] the will yeeldeth, & cannot but conſent, and reſolue, ſaying, [this will I do.] Whereby he hath vndermined the whole foundation of his former defence: for if the drawing of the will by the line of a determinated neceſſitie, doth (as they haue ſaid) diſanull the

freedome of will: then reaſon (which is now confeſſed ſo to ouerrule euerie deliberate action of will, that it cannot reſiſt) may be thought to deſtroy their pretended libertie of will.

In like ſort doth their Cardinall Bellarmine proceed to match grace and will together, by comparing them vnto Duo ſerunt ingentem lapidem, quem vnus ſerre non poſſit: neuter enim alteri vires addit, aut eum impellit, & vtrique liberum eſt onus relinquere.—Sic Deus & voluntas, vt licet in eodem prorſus momento agere incipiant, tamen Deus operatur, quia voluntas operatur, non contrà.—Neque tamen ſequitur Deum pendere à creatura, ſed ab aeterna ſua inſtitutione & voluntate: (A little before) Quoniam ad hoc ſe liberè quodammodo obligabat, quando naturam creabat.

                  25 As yet mans free-will and Gods grace go hand in hand, which maketh their doctrine ſeeme impious; but how ſacrilegious will it appeare to be, when as others ſhall giue mans will the vpper hand? Of this kind we ſuſpect them to be, of whom their Martinz teſtifieth, that Sunt qui putant gratiae efficaciam conſtituendam eſſe in actu voluntatis conſentientis: & illam gratiam efficacem eſſe, cui volunta
                           •

                  28 It is imagined by our Aduerſaries, that there are two men to be conuerted, as for example Peter and Paul, and both of them equally aſſiſted by grace: the queſtion is, whether (this being their ſtate) the one may be conuerted,

the other not. For if they can be equally conuerted, it muſt be attributed onely to the libertie of mans will: if they cannot be equally conuerted, then there is not in the freedome of will that indifferency, which they call libertie, to reiect grace.

                     Although I could willingly aſſent vnto (noting expreſly Cardinal Bellarmine) this author, yet there be three eſpeciall reaſons which hinder me; one is becauſe he changeth the ſtate of the queſtion, which was, that the two parties were ſupported by equall grace: but if God do perſwade the one in more fit and ſeaſonable maner then the other, this being a reſpect of grace, it maketh the grace vnequall.
                  
                  30 Thus may we ſee how that when the bent of theſe our Aduerſaries wits hath bene to pleade for the liberty of mans will, they themſelues are ſo fettered in their owne arguments and anſwers, that not onely in euery paſſage each one can note anothers inſufficiency: but alſo that, like as men in a maze, by much turning and winding, they become ſo impotent, as not to know which way trulie to turne them: ſo theſe by their perplexed and intricate ſubtelties, are ſo intoxicate, as that in the end, their Cardinall Bellarmine is driuen to anſwer to the obiection concerning Gods predeterminations of ſecond cauſes, ſaying, Si Deus non omnia praedeterminaret ante praeuiſionem ſecundarum cauſarum, non poſſet omnia certè praeſcire. Reſpondeo, res omninò difficilis eſt, & fortaſſe in hac vita incomprehenſibilis, &c Bellar. lib. 4. de Lib arb. cap. 15. 
                     This is a verie hard point, and peraduenture in this life not poſsible to be comprehended.
                  
                  31 So likewiſe their Doctor Weſton, a Profeſſor at Doway, taketh vpon him the deciſion of a principall point, Caeterùm ſupereſt adhuc, quod mihi ſaepiùs negotiū faceſſit, cuius apertam intelligentiam neminem v

                     me; the plaine meaning whereof I haue not found ſufficiently vnfolded by any. The point is the reaſon of the concurrance of Gods grace with mans will, pretending that he hath explaned the moſt obſcure queſtion; and yet in that confeſſeth that therein he hath not ſatisfied himſelfe.
                  
                  32 Laſtly, others of them are found De modo quo liberum arbitrium vel mouetur, velſe mouet ad exercitium boni; clamant alij rem nonpoſſe in hac vita percipi, ſed omnem ingenij humani captum ſuperare, Occham & Sà, & Caietaous, & alij.

                     crying and acknowledging, that the manner of Gods mouing of the will paſſeth the capacitie and apprehenſion of mans wit and vnderſtanding: when as elſe our Aduerſaries writing ſo many and huge volumes vpon this one argument of free-will, & profeſſing by their learning and ſubtiltie to ſatisfie from point to point, yet are in the end enforced to confeſſe it a matter impoſſible; what doth it import, but that all this while with loſt labour they haue bene turning an Ixions wheele, and tumbling Siſyphus his ſtone?

                  Our concluſion by way of Appeale.
                  SECT. 12.
                  33 If therefore the importunitie of the Apologiſts, in vpbraiding Proteſtants with oppoſition againſt ſome Fathers in the queſtion of free-will, wherein the ſame cenſure of Proteſtants hath bene iuſtified by many learned §. 1. Ieſuits, may conuince theſe obiectors of inconſiderate boldneſſe:
                  34 If many expreſſe ſentences of the Fathers themſelues, who are acknowledged by §. 3. Ieſuits to haue defended, that by the fall of the firſt man all mankind (as the prodigall child lost his ſubſtance) loſt the freedome of will, may be thought to patronize our cauſe:
                  35 If the iudgement of their Godfridus, Aegidius, Gregorie, Gabriel, Paludanus, Caietane, in §. 5. confeſſing that the will is not abſolutely actiue, be, as Cardinall Bellarmine hath ſaid, to denie their pretended freedome of will:
                  
                  36 If that the §. 5. & §. 6. conſent of their Louanists, Thomists, Dominicans, and others, teaching that Gods operatiue and actiue grace determinateth and applieth the will vnto good, do (as their Ieſuits haue concluded) vndermine the libertie of will defined and defended in the Councell of Trent:
                  37 If, of the defenders of free-will, §. 7. & §. 8. ſome beleeued not the neceſſitie of grace: which doctrine is condemned (by Ieſuits) of Pelagianiſme; 
                     Ibidem. ſome denied that God can abſolutely determine the will, and are confuted by the moſt part; ſome diſliked, that God ſhould be ſaid by his exciting grace to work phyſically in man, and are gainſaid by their Benius, as therein aduerſaries vnto Fathers and Councels; 
                     §. 9. & §. 10. ſome held that God doth not morally determine the will, and are excepted againſt by their Suarez; ſome gaue to mans wil, in the act of conuerſion, an equalitie, yea the preheminence before grace, and are therfore contradicted by others, as repugnant vnto Scriptures & Fathers; and finally, §. 11. ſome laboured to ſatisfie all doubts concerning the concurrance of grace and will, and yet confeſſing that they cannot aſſoile them, are confuted by themſelues:
                  
                     
38 If all theſe may preiudice either our Aduerſaries iudgement, or the ſinceritie of their conſciences, then hath our Reader ſufficient warrant to except againſt the Romiſh doctrine of the freedome of naturall will, in the ſtate of mans corruption before his conuerſiō, by diſcerning it to be but a baſtard, and bondſlaue by the thraldome of ſinne; knowing that a naturall agent hath no more proportionable power in it ſelfe to apply it ſelfe vnto any godly motion, which is a ſpirituall obiect, then can a dead carcaſſe raiſe it ſelfe vnto life. And if that 
                        Gen. 21. 9. Iſmael, Hagars ſeed, euen this naturall will of corruption, ſhall laugh and mocke at actuall grace, as at Iacob the child of promiſe, and thinke himſelfe to be as free as he; then let vs remember the voice which ſpake, ſaying, Caſt out the bond-woman and her ſonne, for ſhe cannot be heire with the free-borne. Doubtleſſe ſo it is, grace and will cannot be both heires and principals in the act of mans conuerſion vnto the ſtate of regeneration. And whether in this caſe we are rather to ſtand vnto Gods ſide, or vnto mans, let any conſcience iudge. We conclude (to omit Alij forta

Wherefore although our Aduerſaries ſhall ſay of themſelues, in reſpect of their will vnto God (be this ſpoken by way of a ſpirituall alluſion) We are 
                        Act. 22. 28.

                  15 Not that ſuch ſeruants of God can be ſaid to haue bene void of good works, but that they examining ſuch their mettals by touch, and by weight, found them too light and vnperfect to deſerue the proper name of merit. Yet ſuch haue alwaies bene the praiers of holy men, not onely of thoſe whom man, but euen of thoſe alſo whom the mouth of God hath canonized and ſaincted. But what need we multiplie examples, eſpecially in a caſe ſo true and euident, that it may be obſerued in all the faithfull, that the moſt worthy ſeruants of God haue alwaies bene moſt readie to acknowledge their owne vnworthineſſe?
                  16 Neither may that be called an anſwer, which their Cardinall Bellarmine hath framed vnto himſelfe, whereby he would ſatisfie an obiection viged from the teſtimonie of S. Bernard: Fortaſſe Bernardus tum ex humilitate, quae prop

                        ia merita ignorat, tum ex incertitudine propriae gratiae prudentei non confidebat in meritis ſuis, ſed in ſola miſericordia:—ſed non i ſeo merita non habebat, quia merita ſua non agnoſcebat. Bellar. lib. 5. de Iuſtif. cap. 6. in fine.
                      
                     Peraduenture S. Bernard (ſaith he) denying that he had any merits, did it in humilitie, or vpon the vncertaintie of his proper grace; ſo that it doth not follow that he had them not, becauſe he did not acknowledge them. For this imagination fighteth againſt the expreſſe doctrine of S. Bernard, as their owne Vega hath alledged him: Et Bernardus: Noſtra, ſi qua eſt, humilis iuſtitia, recta forſitan, ſed non pura, niſi forſitan nos inchores eſſe credimus quàm Patres noſtros, qui non minus veraciter quàm humiliter dixerunt, Omnes iuſtitiae noſtrae tanquam pannus menſtruatae mulieris. Vega lib. 15. de Iuſtif. cap 13. pag 698. 
                     The iustice which is in vs, (ſaith S. Bernard) is peraduenture true, but yet impure, except we ſhall thinke our ſelues better then our fathers, who, no leſſe truly then humbly, confeſſed their iuſtice to be no better then a menſtruous cloth. Their Cardinall doth ſuppoſe that S. Bernard confeſſed rather in humilitie then in truth, contrarie vnto S. Bernard, who profeſſeth to keepe the footſteps of his forefathers, who acknowledged their vnworthineſſe no leſſe truly then humbly. As for the other anſwer of vncertaintie of his proper grace, it doth no more proue that he would denie that he had merits, then it doth confeſſe that he had them; becauſe vncertaintie in the one doth imply an vncertainty in both. And it is certaine that S. Bernard, as he was truly humble, ſo was he humbly true, acknowledging no more in himſelfe, then he taught to be common to all others, to wit, that our workes are ſo farre off from being properly meritorious, that, indeed, we ought to deeme them in their owne nature to be no better then menſtruous.
                     
We now paſſe from the Fathers, to conferre a little with our Aduerſaries, and proue

                     ſeeing God will iudge men according to their works, good works muſt be held neceſſarie vnto ſaluation; yet ſo, as not to attribute the reward to the worthineſſe of the works, but vnto the fauour of Gods promiſe: in which ſence (ſaith M. Bucer) the vſe of the word Merit may be admitted. But vnder that word to conuey into mens hearts an opinion of condignitie, and proper worthineſſe, is (we thinke) but that leauen of ſuperſtitiō, which is able to ſoure the whole lumpe of the beſt action.
                  18 We may furthermore demaund of their Cardinall Bellarmine, who being brought now at length by the euidence of the truth to confeſſe, that Propter incertitudinem

                     it is the ſafeſt for Chriſtians not to put their confidence in merits, but in the ſole mercie and fauour of God: why confeſſing a danger in mans confidence in merit, he ſhould not likewiſe acknowledge danger in their concluſion and doctrine of merit: that is, why he ſhould not inſtruct men as well to truſt and beleeue, that there is no merit in them, as not to truſt vnto merit?

Wherefore our deſire is, that our Aduerſaries would proportion their faiths vnto their hopes, eſpecially if their hope be that which their Cardinall holdeth to be the ſafest, which is, to put confidence onely in Gods grace, and not

                     Why the people of God in the old Teſtament did not vſe to pray vnto the Saints departed, as thus, [holy Abraham pray for vs,] but onely were accuſtomed to call vpon God: he anſwereth, that therefore they were not praied vnto, becauſe they could not ordinarily know the praiers of the liuing then; and that they knew not mens praiers, becauſe they were not then in heauen, and in the ſtate of bleſſedneſſe.

                     The Patriarchs of the old Testament (ſaith he) were not in the ſtate of bleſſedneſſe before the coming of Christ; therefore is there nothing expreſly writtē in the old Teſtament of Inuocation of ſoules departed, neither was this honour due vnto them for feare of Idolatrie. Thus farre concerning the old Teſtament: we in the ſecond place paſſe on to the new, prouing likewiſe

18 Thirdly, S. Peter 2. Epist. 1. 15. writing vnto the diſperſed Chriſtians, (according vnto the Engliſh tranſlation of the Rhemiſts,) ſaith, I will do my diligence you to haue often after my deceaſe alſo, that you may keepe a memorie of theſe things: which words their Ieſuits Salmeron, Suarez, and Bellarmine do iudge for their purpoſe, In 2. Pet. 1. 15 Dabo operam frequenter vos habere poſt obitum meum, vt horum memoriam faciatis.] Quibus oſtenditur Sanctos defunctos cognoſcere preces viuentium. Salmeron Ieſ. in 1. Cor. 13. diſp. 21.

                     excellent to proue, that Peter after his departure would remember them: and this muſt needs be (ſay they) by praying for them. We may anſwer, (not to ſtand vpon their bad Latine, and worſe Engliſh tranſlation) that the true conſtructiō of the words is, that S. Peter promiſeth to Dabo operā, id eſt, ordinabodum ſum in via vt vos habeatis poſt mortem meam libros, qui vobis haec in memoriam reuocent, vt horum memoriam habeatis, id eſt, doctrinam meam impleatis.

                     euident interpretation. We ſee then their obiectiō to pretend, that S. Peter after his departure out of this life would remember them: our anſwer from their Doctors is, that Saint Peter intended to prouide that after his departure they might remember him in his doctrine. And what can the words do his diligence elſe ſignifie? In earth we know there is a place for care and diligence, & in heauen all teares (whereby is ſignified all care and paines) are wiped away. In this queſtion we againe appeale vnto their owne Ieſuite Salmeron, who ſaith, that Nihil de hac re inuenitur in Epiſtolis Pauli, vel Canonicis, atque Catholicis aliorum, quae ob alias ſpeciales materias ſcriptae fuerunt. Salmeron Ieſ. com. in 1. Tim 2. diſp. 2. art. 7. §. Primum. 
                     there is not any thing found either in the Epiſtles of S. Paul, or of S. Peter for this purpoſe: and therefore doth take his flight vnto the booke of the Apocalypſe, where, he ſaith, there is occaſion of this doctrine: which is next to be examined, we prouing

Iohn in his Reuelation cap. 6. telleth vs of the Saints vnder the Alter, which crie vnto Chriſt for reuenge vpon them that ſpilt their bloud: whereupon Cardinall Bellarmine and Ecchius argue thus; In Apocalypſi verò, vbi erat locus ſcribendi futuros ſucceſſus Eccleſiae per modum prophetiae, & praeſertim ſtatus gloriae

And leſt any ſcruple might ariſe from the word ſoules, which are ſaid to crie, their Ieſuite Viega doth preuent it, ſaying, that it is the vſe of Scripture by Nec te mo

                  22 With great diligence haue the Romaniſts ſearched the Scriptures for defence of their Inuocation, & with no leſſe preſumption haue they ſaid, Bellarmine▪ and others in the former Sections. 
                     We haue proued it out of both Teſtaments; ſeeing that al their particular inſtāces haue bin confuted by their owne Doctors: amongſt whom ſome furthermore ſay more largely, that See the Ieſuite Salmeron, and others aboue. 
                     in the old Teſtament the Patriarchs vſed not to be inuocated, both becauſe they were not in perfect ſtate of bleſſedneſſe, and alſo becauſe there had bene then a danger of Idolatrie to offer that honour vnto them. And for the new Teſtamēt, we haue two witneſſes, Ecchius, & their Ieſuit Salmerō, whoſe authority may ſeeme to cōmaund their aſſent: they ſay that Non eſt expreſſum in nouo Teſtament

                     it was not expreſſed in the new Teſtamēt, becauſe in the primitiue Church the Iewes would haue thought it an hard matter to be commaunded to inuocate Saints departed, and the Gentiles would haue taken an occaſion to haue thought that the worſhip of new Gods had bene preſcribed vnto them: Theſe reaſons do equally confute their ſecond hold, when they ſay, that it was a For if that Tradition were then

                  23 In briefe, theſe obſeruations of our Aduerſaries proofes of Inuocation from Scriptures (which are found no leſſe vainely then vehemently obiected againſt vs) do greatly perſwade vs that they in thus contending, haue wrangled with their owne conſciences againſt the light of truth.
                  24 The concluſion which we gather from our Aduerſaries, confeſſing that in the Iewiſh Church the people of God did not vſe to inuocate Abraham and the Patriarths, is, that therefore the doctrine of the like inuocation of Saints departed is not iuſtifiable among Chriſtians: which conſequent is fortified by the iudgment of S. Eſaias Propheta dixit. [Tues Pater noſter, qu

                  33 The principall and moſt popular argument, whereby our Aduerſaries do poſſeſſe the minds of the vniudicious, is (as we finde in their Ieſuite Poſſeuine) to perſwade them, that Proteſtants by denying the doctrine of Inuocation, do deſtroy the V

                     Romane Catechiſme (publiſhed by the decree of the Councell of Trent, and the commaund of Pius Quintus then Pope) doth onely expound, to ſignifie the communion which the militant and viſible Church hath by the ſpirit of charitie in Sacraments, and viſible functions, through a ſympathie of the members thereof. As for the other communion of the Church ſpecified by S. Iohn, * that you (ſaith he) may haue fellowſhip with vs, and that our fellowſhip may be with the Father & the Sonne: it ſignifieth the vnion of one faith, by one Spirit, in one head Chriſt, to one hope of a complete and euerlaſting bleſſedneſſe, wherein all the faithfull haue bene alwaies linked together, and ſhall be vnto the end of the world.
                  34 But the obiectors make three combinations of ſoules, wherein they pretend a ſpirituall communion: firſt is of the ſoules in Purgatorie with the liuing vpon earth: and of thoſe ſoules their Cardinall auoucheth, that Non eſt incredibile animas in Purgatorio pro nobis orare, atque impetrare Bellar. lib. 2▪

                     it is not incredible, but that they in Purgatorie pray for vs: yet (as they confeſſe) the iudgement of Thomas contrarium in 2. 2. q. 83. art. 3. Bellar. ibid. Et Alexander part. 4. q 26. memb. 3. Azor. Ieſ. Inſtit. Moral. part. 1. lib. 9. cap. 10.

                     common opinion of the Schoole doth hold the contrarie; albeit they conceiue of ſoules in Purgatorie as of ſpirits, Animae in Purgatorio, etiamſi inferiores ſint nobis, ratione poenarum, tamen ſuperiores ſunt ratione gratiae & charitatis, in quam

they beleeued not the Virgine Mary to be God, yet (as Cardinall Bellarmine confeſſeth) they Cùm non ſecus ac Deus inuocatur: ita olim quidā Mariam, quos Epiphanius refellit. Hareſ. 79. 
                     inuocated her with an honour due vnto God; and were anciently confuted by Epiphanius. Which manner of indirect honour, we thinke will appeare to be as rife in the Romiſh worſhippers, as were the 
                        Matth. 13.

                  47 Then, ſeeing ſome of our Aduerſaries haue profeſſedly ſuggeſteda confirmation of this doctrine out of Scriptures of the old & new Teſtament, both by generall aſſertions, & particular inſtances, and haue bene §. 3. 4. 5. 6. confuted from point to point by the teſtimonies of their owne Doctors: our Reader is occaſioned to ſuſpect both the credit of the obiectors, who haue violently forced the Scriptures beyond compaſſe, & alſo the truth of the article, which is proued to haue no direct euidence in Scripture.
                  48 Next, knowing the greateſt part of Romiſh Inuocation dependeth vpon the authority of the §. 7. Pope of Rome in canonizing Saints, a iuriſdiction both new, and §. 7.

Furthermore, conſidering that our Aduerſaries in enquiring what parties are to be inuocated, are (as it were) at a croſſe-way, ſaying and gainſaying, that they in §. 8. 
                     Purgatorie pray for vs, and we to them, &c. and teaching an inuocation of Saints canonized, which may be ſubiect vnto errour; and yet forbidding all inuocation of particular Infants, who (in their iudgement) are infallibly ſaincted: our Reader may weigh, whether this incongtuitie iſſue not meerely from preſumption.

                  SECT. 2.

                     the working remiſsion of ſinne, is now by them obiected againſt Proteſtants, as aduerſaries thereunto. Wherein appeareth their double ignorance, firſt in not vnderſtanding the generall doctrine of Proteſtants, which notwithſtanding our greateſt Aduerſarie hath thus acknowledged: Lutherus art. 2. ait, omnia peccata in Baptiſmo remitti. Caluinus, omnium peccatorū reatus per Baptiſmum deleri, Philippus Melancthon, Peccatum in baptiſmo remitti, vt non imputetur. Bellarm lib. 1. de Baptiſ. cap. 13. Kemnitius fatetur remitti in Baptiſmo omnia peccata, quinetiam tolli ac deleri, & ſolùm reliquias quaſdam originalis peccati reſtare. Bellar. ibid. Neither do they affirme a bare remiſſion onely, but ſuch a one as doth alwayes imply regeneration alſo, and an inchoatiue extinction of originall concupiſcence and ſinne. Therefore Luther [In Tit 3. Baptiſmus eſt lauacrum regenerations] Non quo externus homo abluitur tantùm, ſed quo tota natura mutetur in aliam naturam, id eſt, quo prior natiuitas carnalis deſtruitur cum tota peccatorum & perditionis natiuitate. Luther homil. in Tit. 3. If peraduenture ſome particular one ſhould hold otherwiſe, yet ſhould they not by thus obiecting make it the Tenet of Proteſtants.
                      
                     Luther, Caluine, Melancthon, and Kemnitius ſay (ſaith he,) that both remiſsion of ſinne is giuen, and regeneration wrought in Baptiſme. Secondly, they haue much iniured the Centuriſts, whom they produce as cenſurers of the Fathers in this point of efficacie of Baptiſme, (which conſiſteth in the remiſſion of ſinne;) but do vtterly miſtake, in the 
                        For the Centuriſts, Cent. 2. c. 4 col. 47. line 43. note the efficacie of Baptiſme not for an error, but for a truth taught by the Fathers. Sentiunt regenerationem fieri per baptiſmum & verbum, quibus coniunctis efficaciam tribuunt remiſſionem peccatorū, & quidem in adultis poenitentiam requirunt. No more blaming the Fathers for affirming the efficacie of baptiſme remiſſion and regeneration, then for requiring repentance in euery adultus baptized.

                     S. Auguſtine, Fulgentius, Gregory, and other Fathers did teach, that Infants dying without Baptiſme did preſently deſcend into the place of the damned, to be ſenſibly tormented in hell-fire. Neuertheleſſe, now (ſay they) the generall profeſsion of our Church is againſt it. How then ſhall we preſume of ſinceritie in our Apologiſts, who in the doctrine of the neceſſitie of Sacraments, do ſo cloſely purſue vs with that authority, which they themſelues do, in theſe two points, freely, and (as we willingly confeſſe) alſo iuſtly refuſe? Notwithſtanding ſeeing their argument ſo vrgeth the abſolute neceſsitie of Baptiſme of Infants, as without which they cannot poſſibly be ſaued, we deſcend vnto a ſecond triall, to know.

                     deferred their Baptiſme for a long ſeaſon. Whether this were ordinarie, or (as ſome of them will haue it) extraordinarie, is not pertinent vnto the point of neceſſitie. Socrates noteth, that Aliam conſuetudinem in Theſſalia eſſe cognoui, vt diebus Paſchatis duntaxat baptizent: ob quam cauſam omnes, paucis admodū exceptis, abſque baptiſmo moriuntur. Socrates hiſs.

                     God is not tied in his bond vnto his Sacraments. Which may be (we thinke) a comment vpon that text where it is written, [

                     ſame faith. Well then, could a Iewiſh 2. Sam. 12.

But what ſhould hinder their ſaluation? only the want of Baptiſme by water? How then could Valentinian be ſaued? They ſay this was, becauſe the want of the outward baptiſme of water was ſupplied by the inward Baptiſme of the ſanctifying Spirit: and we know, that

                  14 The Romaniſts haue added yet a third Baptiſme, which they terme ſanguinis, of bloud: which, they ſay, acquitteth a man of the neceſſarie debt of Baptiſme, which is by water; Martyrium rectè dicitur eſſe quoddam baptiſma—dans gratiam ex opere operato.—Probatur ex Martyrio infantum: Conſtat enim infantes pro Chriſto occiſos non ſolùm ſaluari, ſed etiam haberi ab Eccleſia in numero Martyrum, &c.—Infantes qui nihil poſſunt operari:—& probabiliſſimum eſt, & ferè certum, eos non fuiſſe circumciſos, inter quos non pauci erant Gentiles. Bellar. lib. 1. de Bapt. cap. 6. §. Prima propoſitio, &c. 
                     ſo that aſwell the vnbaptized children, as men being ſlaine for Chriſt, are truly baptized (ſay they) in their owne bloud, & therby
                     
                     are not onely ſaued, but alſo numbred among the bleſſed Martyrs: which they thinke to be confirmed by the example of the Infants ſlaine at the birth of Chriſt.

                     as another mans ſinne was originally the cauſe of their damnation; ſo other mens faith ſufficeth them vnto Baptiſme, for their ſaluation. Hence their owne Authors do learnedly thus collect, Ait Thomas 3. part. q. 68. & q. 69. A. 6. ad 3.

Si itaque fides & voluntas Eccleſiae infantibus accomodata, eos baptiſmo conſequendo idoneos reddit: quid quaeſo cauſae eſt cur non etiam eos obtinendae ſanctificationi idoneos efficiat, ſi externum baptiſmi ſignum iam voto praeſumptum, neceſſitas, quae vitari non poteſt, iam ſola prohibeat?—Nam etiam ante Baptiſmum ſuſceptum, paruulos in credentium numero aliquo modo haberi, ex priſcae Eccleſiae conſuetudine apparet, quâ infantes ante lotionem de fide interrogantur an credant, &c.—quod etiā patet ex ordine Romano, in quo feria 4. hebdom. 3. quadrageſimae ſcrutinium, quod vocatur, etiam in paruulis ab huiuſmodi interrogatione ſolenni & profeſſione fidei per Acolythum in nomine Infantium inchoabatur.—Quod niſi haec inani & mendaci caeremonia fieri dicamus, certè vel tunc infantes non prorſus à fide alieni habendi ſunt &c.—Ergo non deeſt illis prorſus fides, nec conuerſio cordis, quae illis per Dei benignitatem imputatur,—praeſertim vbi voluntas (namely of the offerers) pro facto reputetur, vbi factum excludit neceſsitas, vt docet Bernardus in epiſtola ad Hugonē de Sancto Victore: vbi etiamfi neget infantes hanc fidem, hoc eſt, cordis ad Deum conuerſionem habere, prohibente aetate, & conſequenter ſalute priuari, ſi abſque baptiſmi perceptione moriantur: fatetur tamen in eodem loco, ipſos cùm baptizantur infantes fide omninò non carere, ſine qua impoſsibile eſt vel ipſis infantibus placere Deo, ſed ſaluari & ipſos per fidem, non ſuam quidem ſed alienam. Caſſander ipſe ibid. pag. 140. 
                     Seeing that (ſay they) according to the ancient cuſtome of the Church, yea and the Romane order of Baptiſme, the child when it is baptized, is ſolemnely asked, whether it do beleeue, and whether it deſire to be baptized; and anſwer is made by the Church in the name of the child, I beleeue, and, that is my deſire: it cannot be denied, but that the child (except we will confeſſe that this is a vaine and lying ceremonie, which is vſed in the Church) is, before it be baptized, in ſome ſort partaker of the Sacrament of Baptiſme, euen by the faith of the Church, which hath vowed them hereunto. So that, in caſe of neceſſitie children are no leſſe excuſable by the vow, and the faith of the Church, then the adulti are held to be by their owne: which point they haue further cleared & confirmed by a pertinent and pregnant Quid ſi quis Paterfamilias inter barbaros firmiter ſtatuerit, die craſtino familiam ſuam totam, in qua etiam infantes ſunt, Chriſto per baptiſmum conſecrare, & ipſe cum vniuerſa familia vel ſubita

The vnſoundneſſe of which poſition is diſcerneable: firſt, becauſe it is not a Catholike, that is, not an vniuerſall faith, which not onely ſome ancient Churches confuted by their §. 4. practiſe, but alſo many late §. 5.

truth; the contrarie whereunto their owne ſingularly approued §. 5. §. 6. §. 7.

                  21 Laſtly, euerie child at the fiſt birth is, in both Churches, vowed and deſtinated to be baptized in due time: but yet differently; for the Church of Rome deſpaireth of the ſaluatiō of ſuch a ſoule dying without baptiſme: the Church of the Proteſtants do beleeue, that by the mercie of God in Chriſt, it ſhall enioy bleſſedneſſe. Now then (ſuppoſing an indifference of truth on both ſides,) whether doctrine is more ſafe, may be iudged by the grace of our Lord, who promiſeth to anſwer his Church according to her faith.

And then we anſwer them, that although there hath bene found among themſelues one Biſhop, who hath defended that Baptiſme is of no efficacy without the ſigne of the Croſſe; yet by their common doctrine is that opinion iudged to be Refellitur error Claudij Epiſcopi Taurinenſis, qui dixit Baptiſma eſſe nullum, niſi ſignum crucis fronti baptizati infigeretur: Hic autem manifeſtus eſt error, conſtat enim cùm Chriſtus inſtitueret baptiſma, nunquam de ſigno crucis meminiſſe.

This laſt vnction, which is after death (whereby their doctine of Purgatorie, threatning horrible torment, & promiſing no preſent reſt, may ſeeme to receiue no little preiudice) the Romaniſts haue neglected, and yet ſpare not to impute an iniquitie vnto Proteſtants for omitting the former: when as ſuch ancient ceremonies may according vnto the diuerſe conditions of times, & diſcretion of ſeuerall Churches, permit both their vſe, & change, alwaies with this caueat, that they be neither altered by the ſpirit of faction, nor vſed with a ſuperſtitious opinion.

                     Cyprians meaning in thoſe minora delicta, quae non in Deum committuntur, is greatly miſtaken, becauſe S. Cyprian doth not compare publike ſinnes with priuate, but publike ſinnes with publike ſinnes; becauſe the leſſer ſinnes were ſo great, that the committers of them could not be admitted (as himſelfe ſpeaketh) into the communion of the Church, without the abſolution, and impoſition of the hands, both of the Biſhop & his Cleargie: and the great ſinnes there ſpoken of, were no leſſe then lapſus tempore perſecutionis, that is, renouncing of the faith of Chriſt in the time of perſecution, and polluting themſelues with heatheniſh Idolatrie: this Apoſtaſie from the faith of Chriſt, which is the monſter of ſinnes, S. Cyprian compareth with other ſcandalous ſinnes which men are ſubiect vnto, & did in the end reſolue, that if the leſſer ſinnes are not abſolued without confeſsion, then muſt theſe extreme rebellions againſt God vndergo a publike cenſure, before that the offenders could be receiued into the boſome of the Church. Hereby it is plaine, that the Exomologeſis in Cyprian cannot ſignifie any auricular confeſſion, neither can thoſe minor a delicta, leſſer ſinnes, betoken any venials, nor doth he mention ſins of thought, or priuate tranſgreſsions, but ſuch as were poſſibly both hainous in themſelues, and ſcandalous vnto the Saints.

ordinance of God, whom the Philoſophers called primum, & verum, and whom we profeſſe to be both the antiquitie of truth, and truth of antiquitie. And therfore for diſabling the defence of the Romiſh doctrine of confeſſion, we lay downe this propoſition, viz.
               
               
                  That the pretended Romiſh Confeſsion is not from Diuine institution, nor any doctrine of faith: proued by the testimonies of our learned Aduerſaries.

Lyra in Leuit. 16. 21. 
                     the Prieſt heard not the particular confeſsions of the people, for that had bene impoſsible, but onely in generall. Accordingly haue others pronounced concerning the new Teſtament, as their Ieſuite Maldonate witneſſeth: Sunt etiam inter Catholicos, qui putant nullum eſſe praeceptum diuinum de confeſſione, vt omnes Decretorum Interpretes, & inter Scholaſticos Sotus.

                     Diuerſe Catholicks, among whom are all the Interpreters of the Decrees, do thinke that there is no diuine precept for this kind of confeſsion. Which opinion, he notwithſtanding is emboldened to call now hereticall, whereof their owne Gloſſator long ſince was licenced to affirme, that Melius dicitur ab vniuerſalis Eccleſiae traditione, quàm noui aut veteris Teſtamenti authoritate inſtituram fuiſſe.

                     it is more truly ſaid to haue bene ordained by a tradition of the Church, then by any authoritie either of the old or new Teſtament. If this be not ſufficient, we purſue further to proue

                  SECT. 5.
                  8 No man will ſay, that any command can be iuſtly impoſed by law of neceſsitie, wherein there is the ſtampe of an impoſsibilitie of performance; for euerie ſuch law reigneth not as a king, but as a tyrant: of which kind we doubt their Decree of neceſſarie confeſsion will appeare to be.
                  9 What the doctrine of Proteſtants is concerning the priuate confeſſion of particular ſins, we permit their Cardinall Bellarmine to report: Admittit etiā Caluinus priuatam (confeſſionē) coram Paſtore, quando quis ita angitur & afflictatur peccatorum ſenſu, vt ſe explicare niſi alieno adiutorio nequeat: ſed addit moderationem, vt libera ſit, ne

                         ab omnibus exigatur, nec neceſſariò de omnibus. Etenim, inquit Melancthon, connum eratio omnium impoſſibilis, &c. Vnto theſe he adioyneth the conſent of Kemnitius: Non neceſſariam eſſe ait: and Omniſi Proteſtantium. Bellarm. lib. 3. de Poenit. cap. 1. 
                     Caluin (ſaith he, and he adioyneth vnto Caluin other Proteſtants) admitteth of priuate confeſsion to be made vnto the Pastor, whenſoeuer any is afflicted in his conſcience, and ſhall haue need of anothers helpe: yet with this moderation, that this confeſsion be free, and not exacted, and ſecondly, that it do not enioyne a rehearſall of all particular ſinnes. Herein condemning the Romane Church (as there appeareth) of a double error, the firſt is the opinion of neceſſitie, to charge men vpon danger of damnation to confeſſe (if they can) their ſecret ſinnes: the ſecond is, by the exacting an enumeration of particulars, which is a doctrine of impoſſibilitie.

                  10 In the point of impoſſibilitie, the now practiſe of the Romiſh Church is ſo maruellouſly exorbitant and degenerate, as that it cauſed their owne Rhenanus to complaine, that their chiefe Schoole-men Scotus and Aquinas, haue, by their Deuteronomies and new rules, made a forme of priuate confeſſion, Aquinas & Scotus, nimiùm arguti homimes talem confeſſionem reddiderunt, vt grauis Theologus ſaepè teſtatus ſit, iuxta illorum deuteroſeis impoſſibile eſſe nobis confiteri.

                     Becauſe men (ſaith he) commonly are no competent Iudges in their owne caſes, and not able oftentimes to ſay whether their acts be ſinfull or not, or if they thinke them infected with ſinne, yet can they not deſcerne whether they be mortall or veniall; therefore are they compellable to confeſſe vnto the Prieſt whatſoeuer they haue done, that they may obtaine remiſsion of ſinne: and becauſe the Priest can remit no ſins, but ſuch as he heareth confeſſed, he that muſt remit all, muſt first heare all; 
                     Nec Sacerdos remittit vllum peccatum, niſi poenitens proferat, quae debet, omnia. Suarez Ieſ. tom. 4. diſp. 22. 
                     Neither can the Prieſt remit any one ſinne, (ſaith their Ieſuite Suarez) except the penitent confeſſe all that he ought to confeſſe.
                  
                  13 The caſe is now plaine, that howſoeuer they Reliqua peccata, quae diligenter cogitanti non occurrūt, in vniuerſum in eadem confeſsi one incluſa intelliguntur. Concil. Trid. Seſſ. 14. cap. 5. 
                     wrap vp whole bundles of forgotten ſins within thoſe which are confeſſed, yet the reaſon which they giue for the neceſſitie of their confeſſion ſheweth, that man is obliged to confeſſe, not ſo much, becauſe he iudgeth his owne act to be ſinful, as that he may be iudged whether he hath ſinned. And becauſe he in his ignorance may miſdeeme his own actions, taking that to be good which is a ſinne, & of his ſins think that to be venial, which is indeed mortal, the party confeſſing is chargeable by this rule, & the Ieſuits concluſion, to reueale all whatſoeuer he hath done, that is, whatſoeuer might either in word or worke be ſubiect vnto a mortall ſin; the rather becauſe (as the Ieſuit Coſterus truly obſerueth) Saepè quae leuia ſunt nobis, grauia ſunt Deo; quod primos parentes ob culpam, vt primo aſpectu apparet, leuem, de ſummo gradu dignitatis in maximas miſerias cum vniuerſa poſteritate deturbabat. Coſterus Ieſ. Enchirid. Tract, de fide ſpeciali. §. Admittitur. 
                     that may ſeeme a light offence vnto man, which is hainous in Gods ſight. He exemplifieth it in the firſt ſinne, and ſo he may well, for it ſeemed vnto the offender to be 
                        Gen. 3. 
                     faire and pleaſant, and as it were, but a veniall ſinne; but it had a mortall, yea an immortal worme within, which we call ſinne, which doth engender vnto death, and to eternall bondage; not in words and works onely, but euen in the inward affections, and ſecret cogitations. Which cauſed Chriſt to vpbraid the Phariſees with the 
                        Matth. 9. 4. 
                     euill of their thoughts: for thoughts alſo (howſoeuer they be free among men, who cannot diſcerne them,) enter into the ballances of Gods triall and iudgement.
                  14 The briefe of all this is, to know that if there be no remiſſion of any ſinne, which is not particularly and truly confeſſed vnto the Prieſt; no true confeſſion, which is not of all that ought to be diſcouered; no iuſt diſcouerie, where all acts ſubiect vnto ſinne are not expreſſed; and that there is neither word nor worke, whether outward or inward, either in thought or affection of heart, but is ſubiect vnto the contagion of ſinne: then muſt it follow, that either their manner of confeſſion is to no end (that is, not neceſſarie,) or elſe is it endleſſe, and impoſſible.
                  15 Secondly, the curioſitie of that art of confeſſion, by ſearching and ripping vp other mens ſores, hath proued ſo loathſome, that their Biſhop Tyardaeus doth greatly complaine of ſome Ieſuits, Iſti verò (ſpeaking of the Ieſuits) ſancti ſcil. pneumatici, quibuſdam interrogationum formulis circa ſcrupuloſas peccatorum differentias obſcoena & impudica quaedam exquirunt, quae ſine vtriuſ

                  The concluſion, ſhewing whether the doctrine of Proteſtants, or of the Romaniſts is more ſafe.
                  SECT. 7.
                  16 There are two Courts whereunto ſinners are to be conuented, coeli & ſoli, the tribunall in heauen, and the Church on earth: vnto the firſt all kind of ſinners are ſummoned by their inward conſciences daily to appeare, and to looke vpon God the Iudge, whom ſome behold on the left ſide; ſuch are they who ſtand onely in the eye of his iuſtice, and forthwith are ready with Cain in deſperation to runne away: others behold him on the right ſide, where they ſee directly their Aduocate Ieſus pleading their pardons, by whom that tribunall of the Iudge is turned to a mercie ſeate, and they heare the gracious proclamation of pardon vnto all faithfull penitents.
                  17 The other Court, which is of the Church militant, is ſubordinate vnto the former, & doth exerciſe a iuriſdiction ouer the conſciences of men; but with a difference, for here the examiners are but men, vnable to ſearch throughly into the hearts of confeſſors, and conſequently may erre in the vſe of the key, by locking and opening, that is, by condemning & abſoluing amiſſe: but God is the diſcerner of all ſpirits, who only 
                        Iſa. 22. 22. 
                     ſhutteth and no man openeth, and openeth and no man can ſhut; whereby it may happen that the innocent ſoule may ſtand bound in the inferiour Courts of mans iudgement, and yet by grace be acquitted and abſolued before God: which ſheweth that mans abſolution is not of an abſolute neceſſitie. Neuertheleſſe the authoritie of particular Churches is not to be condemned, for they are Chriſts confeſſaries, and haue a iuriſdiction ouer publike and priuate ſinners, againſt publike and notorious offenders; wherein they ſhould proceed without partiality, as S. Paul did againſt the 1. Cor. 5. 
                     inceſtuous, and as S. Cyprian againſt thoſe See aboue. 
                     Apoſtates. For if this were duly executed according to the power giuen vnto thē, then might many wretched and diſſolute ſinners be drawn out of Sathans bonds, and (to allude vnto the Prophet Dauids Pſalme) they might ſing and ſay, 
                        Pſal. 23. 4. 
                     Thyrod, (that is, thy ſhepheards ſtaffe) hath comforted me: but as we cannot but wiſh the vigour of this ancient diſcipline reuiued, ſo haue our Aduerſaries no cauſe to boaſt of the practiſe thereof; for their Ieſuits do willingly confeſſe, that Quod non tam apertè & frequenter, & in ſpecie res etiam ipſa Indulgentiarum à veteribus commemoretur, cauſa fuit vſus ſeuerioris poenitentiae, qu
                           •
                         temporibus illis multum vigebat, ita vt non eſſet magnoperè neceſſarium beneficio indulgentiarum vti: poſteà verò decreſcente feruore poenitentiae, illarum (Indulgentiarum) vſus inualeſcere coepit. Greg. de Val. Ieſ. lib. de Indulg. cap. 4. Paulò poſt initium. Quia tunc homines feruentiores erant in bonis operibus, & minùs indigebant indulgentijs quàm nos, ergo non tam amplas remiſsiones habebant. Tollet. Ieſ. Inſtruct. Sacerd. lib. 6. ca. 22. 
                     as ſeueritie of diſcipline (vſed ſo feruently in ancient times) decreaſed, ſo the vſe of Indulgences did increaſe. Which in effect is as much as to grant, that their late * doctrine and practiſe of Romiſh Indulgences is the bane and ouerthrow of ancient diſcipline: and Luther, we know, was the great Probatur Indulgentia ex Bulla Leonis 10. contra Lutherū, & in Decretali quam ad Caietanum Legatū

                  18 Concerning priuate ſinnes, which (as Origen ſaith) muſt be purged by vomit (meaning, by an orall confeſſion vnto the Church,) whereby the ſurfets of mans heart, and the vndiſgeſted gorge of a loathſome conſcience is

disburdened, we alſo hold to be a good phiſicke, and verie ſoueraigne for the ſoule of man; which may be done either by a generall confeſſion of ſinnes, or elſe by a diſtrict acknowledgement of ſome particulars.
                  19 Of the generall confeſſion we need not diſpute, their Cardinall Admittit Caluinus, lib. 3. Inſtit. cap. 4. generalem (confeſſionem) quam Miniſter pro ſe & populo in Eccleſia faciat. Bellarm. lib. 3 de Poenit. cap. 1. Bellarmine doth grant that this is practized amongſt Proteſtants: the onely queſtion is about the other kind. And the vſe of priuate confeſſion is (as our Aduerſaries haue witneſſed) acknowledged by Proteſtants, but with a double limitation and reſtraint, the firſt is the foreſaid §. 4.

                     Cyprian and other ancient Fathers did enioyne vnto offenders a proportionable outward Penance, which might be properly a medicinable helpe, for the mortifying of ſinne, and teſtifing his inward remorſe, together with the ſatisfying of the parties offended,

and eſpecially the Church of God; thereby to procure the Churches praiers, and a miniſteriall abſolution, with a pardon from God. But our onely queſtion is concerning the manner of their iniunctions; whether there be not ſomewhat reprehenſible in them. For our better diſcharge in this point, we firſt declare,
               
               
                  How farre theſe exceptions taken by Protestants, are iuſtifiable in the iudgement of our learned Aduerſaries.

                  2 The taxation of ancient Fathers is onely for the inconueniency of Nimis aſperè & durè locuti ſunt: non tamen concedam eo ſenſu dixiſſe quo accipiuntur à nouis ſatisfactionarijs, vt probo ex Chryſoſt. & Auguſtino, qui omnem ſatisfactionem referebant non ad expiationem delictorum praeteritorum, ſed ad cautionem in poſterum ſe a peccatis abſtinendi.

Caluin himſelfe proueth from expreſſe doctrine of the ſame Fathers: whoſe integritie of acquitting the Fathers from any error of doctrine, our Apologiſts ought in right to haue acknowledged. But ſeeing his name is to the Romaniſts ſo odious, that they commaund it Supprimatur nomen Caluini: & loco [D. Caluinus] ponatur, Studioſus quidam. Index Expurg. Belg. pag. 204. 
                     to be blotted out, euen in his ſentence which, in their own iudgemēt, is greatly praiſworthy: we maruel not that this ſhould be thought leſſe gracious, although otherwiſe in it ſelfe neuer ſo iuſtifiable: as may appeare by the obſeruation which Cardinall Bellarmine bequeatheth vnto his Reader, teaching him to vnderſtand, that Satisfactio non offertur pro culpa, ſed pro poena; quòd ſi veteres patres interdum actionibus humanis tribuere id videntur, vt pro expianda culpa ſatisfaciant, interpretandi ſunt ex congruo, non ex condigno. Bellar. lib. 4. de Poenit. cap. 1. 
                     when the Fathers attribute ſatisfaction vnto mens actions for expiation of ſinnes, they muſt be interpreted as to vnderſtand ſatisfaction, or merit, de congruo, of congruitie, and not that (which onely is properly called merit) de condigno, that is, of equall worthineſſe and condignitie.
                  
                  3 We ſee then, that our Aduerſaries themſelues dare not take the ſentences of the Fathers with their naked hands, and therefore haue they cautelouſly qualified their phraſes with a diſtinction of Merit or Satisfaction, de congruo, and de condigno: which notwithſtanding is ſo incongruous and ſucceſſeſſe a diſtinction, that it is reiected by their owne Catholicos quoſdam viros dictiſsimos & pientiſsimos adhuc video eò propendere, vt Eccleſia meritum de congruo repellat, vt contra Patrum authoritatem

It might therefore haue behooued both theſe Romaniſts, and alſo our Centuriſts, to haue accorded to the aboue ſpecified wiſdome & moderation of M. Caluine, in reprouing ſome of their hyperbolicall and exceſsiue phraſes, and to haue bene directed by their more perſpicuous & plaine teſtimonies, wherby they clearely manifeſt their orthodoxall meanings: whereof we deliuer our Reader a taſt, ſhewing

                  SECT. 3.
                  4 Although the Fathers do ſometimes exceed in phraſe of ſpeech (as hath bene confeſſed,) terming their Penances not onely medicinall corrections (which we allow,) but euen alſo an expiatorie price, and ſatisfaction of Gods diuine iuſtice againſt the guilt of ſinne: which their Cardinall will haue warily interpreted, and in an vnproper ſence: yet the ſame Fathers when they caſt their eies vpō ſome penitēts, who are proudly conceited of the worthineſſe of their humilitie, do teach ſuch men Chriſtus nobis propitiatio factus eſt: ergo in ipſo omninò Poenitentiae ſacrificium miniſtratur & agitur, & omne quod ex poenitentia quis conſequitur, ad cum refertur. Heſychius in Leuit. 7. lib. 2. 
                     to esteeme Chriſt the onely propitiation in Penance: and to acknowledge, that Cùm omnem vitam in peccatis detriuerim, ſi me poenituerit, fiámne ſaluus? prorſus fies. Vnde hoc liquet? ab ipſa Domini tui benignitate, non ex tua poenitentia mihi ſumo fiduciam: poenitentia enim tua non valet tantam abſtergere malorum luem, &c. Chryſoſt. de Poenit. homil. 3. ſiue in Hypomuemat. in Eſalam.
                      
                     it is mercie, and not onely Penance, which purgeth the leproſie of ſinne. And therefore Ergo & agendam poenitentiam, & tribuendam veniam credere nos conuenit, vt veniam tamen tanquam ex fide ſperemus, non tanquam ex debito. Ambroſ. de Penit. lib. 2. cap. 8. 
                     in Penance to hope for pardon, not of right, but by promiſe through faith, becauſe Sola ſecundi Adami tribulatio purgat quos contaminauit offenſio ſola prioris: non quòd propria cuiquam ſufficere poſsit ſatisfactio.

                     Etſi fratres pro fratribus moriamur, tamen in fratemorum peccatorum remiſſ nullius ſanguis Martyris funditur; quod fecit Chriſtus pro nobis, nec in hoc quid imitemur, ſed quid gratulemur contulit nobis. Auguſt in Ioh. tract. 84. 
                     Martyrs, when they die for others, can be ſaid to haue power of imitating Chriſt in gaining remiſsion for other mens ſinnes, becauſe Chriſt hath not giuen vs a vertue of imitation of him herein, but of congratulation; and then to teſtifie, that Ego teſtificor ac fide iubeo, fore vt ſi quiſquam noſtrûm, qui peccatis obnoxij ſumus, recedens à priſtinis malis, ex animo veréque promittat Deo ſe poſtea nunquam ad illa rediturum, nihil aliud Deus requirat ad ſatisfactionem vlteriorem.

Chryſoſtom. in 1. Cor. homil 28. 
                     God (it is not then of merit, but of acceptance) accepteth of ſincere and vnfained repentance, and conſtant purpoſe of amendment of life, for our ſatisfaction; Laſtly, to repoſe our mournfull ſoules in the Omnium piorum ſub hoc onere corruptibils carnis, & in huitis vitae infirmitate gementium, ſpes vna eſt, quòd Aduocatum habemus. &c.

                     How farre diſtance there is betweene the now Romiſh Church, and the iudgement of Antiquitie, in this point of penitentiall ſatisfaction. The firſt is want of obſeruation of due order.
                  
                  SECT. 4.
                  5 This firſt aberration from Antiquitie doth appeare by their practiſe. For the Fathers enioyned ſinners to performe ſome externall kinds of Penances, as medicinable cures of the ſicke ſoule, and trials of his vnfained repentance, before that euer they did abſolue them, and reſtore them to the peace of the Church; as appeareth by the laſt obiected place of Cyprian, and the confeſſion of their owne Hoc intereſt inter actionem poenitentiae, ſeu exomologeſin veteribus vſitatam, & eam, quae nunc vſu recepta eſt, quòd olim niſi his operibus ab Eccleſiae praefecto iniunctis ritè peractis, abſolutio & reconciliatio, & communionis ius per manus impoſitionem non concedebatur:—quae quidem actiones ad remiſsionem impetrandam. & Dei offenſam placandam valere putabantur, non quòd eam dignitate ſua mere

6 But contrary-wiſe the Romaniſts (which he likewiſe obſerueth) do firſt abſolue the confeſsing penitents, and afterwards impoſe vpon them the ſatisfactory works. Which we note, not as thinking that works (if they be godly) may not be wholſomly enioined, but that the pretenders of antiquity ſhould not be thus prepoſterous. Beſides this,
               
               
                  A ſecond Aberration, not onely from Fathers, but euen from their owne profeſsion, by diuerſe ſtrange and vnreaſonable manners of diminiſhing and diſſoluing of their Penance.
                  SECT. 5.
                  7 They Ieiunijs, orationibus, eleemoſynis, vel alijs pietatis officijs nos poſſe ſatiſfacere. Concil. Trident. Seſſ. 14. can. 13. glorie indeed much of their penitentiall acts, to wit, faſting, praier, almes, and other works of pietie: yet ſo, as to inſtruct their Prieſts to vſe Multis modis poteſt Confeſſor diminuere poenitentiam,—tertiò quando poenitens eſt ita imperfectus, vt timor ſit ipſum non accepturū poenitentiam, aut, ſi accipit, non impleturū. 
                     many waies of diminiſhing mens Penance, as for example, when it may be doubted that the penitent either wil not receiue the enioyned Penance, or elſe will not performe it. The penitent cannot be offended when he may do as he will.
                  8 And if he be not willing to haue any ſuch Penance enioyned him, then are they taught to vſe a more gentle plaiſter in this forme: Quintò quādo alià viâ iuuantur poenitentia & ſatisfactio, imponendo ei omnia quae facturus eſt bona, & quae paſſuru

                     Whatſoeuer good thou ſhalt do, & whatſoeuer euill thou ſhalt patiently endure, be all that vnto thee in ſtead of thy Penance. Here is no penal matter, which is commonly of works not commaunded of God: for ſuch works as theſe they cal opera aliàs Deo debita, that is, works which euery Chriſtian man (euen without Penance) is bound to performe vnto God, & conſequently here is a Penance without Penance.
                  9 Againe, leſt that their penitents might proue refractarie and wayward children, they haue prouided that the Prieſt in confeſſion may Poteſt vnus pro altero reiunare, vel bona opera facere, ſed quod eſt meriti, ſibi non alteri dari poteſt.—Poteſt igitur Confeſſarius imponere poenitentiam poenitenti per ſe, vel per alium implendam: licet non debet facere, niſi rationabili de cauſa. Idem ibid.
                      
                     impoſe vpon the partie a Penance to be performed either by himſelfe, or by another, ſo that it may be ſufficient if he can get another man to faſt for him. It is not heard of in phyſicke, that one ſhould receiue health by another mans diet, nor in Diuinitie, that any ſhall be iudged but according to his 2. Corinth. 5. 
                     owne works, or iuſtified but by his

                        Galat. 6. 
                     euerie one muſt beare his owne burthen: yet thus they thought good to prouide for their delicate penitentiaries, by beating them vpon other mens ſhoulders, and inflicting inſenſible puniſhments vpon them. Which kind of tranſlation of puniſhment, the ancient Fathers, if they had but dreamed of, would haue entertained with laughter, if yet the pittying of mens follies could haue permitted them to laugh.
               
               
                  Their third reuolt from Antiquitie, is their diſſoluing of the doctrine of Penance by their new doctrine of Indulgence, practiſing thereby a kind of impoſtureſhip.

And his concluſion is, that it is not to be doubted, but the Pope can erre in his diſpenſations: and we preſume, that they will hold the priuiledge of the Pope to be no greater in diſpoſing of Indulgences, then in diſpenſing with lawes.

So that a man hath a double title vnto eternall glorie, the one by the merits of Christ communicated vnto him by grace, the ſecond by his owne merits. Which manner of ſatisfaction is not improbable.
                  
                  19 Which doctrine of ioyning the honour of Chriſt and mans in the maruellous worke of Satisfaction, (which themſelues do not affirme as certaine, but as being in their owne eies onely not improbable,) Proteſtants iudge to be rather execrable, according to the confeſſions of their owne Doctors

Bernard his reſolution, who being a light ſhining in the darkneſſe of ſuperſtition, at the time of his diſſolution, and conflict with Sathan, did not preſume of his owne ſatisfaction ioyned with the ſatisfaction of Christ; but contrarily, did thus commend his ſoule vnto God: See aboue. 
                     I confeſſe (ſaith he) that I am vnworthie, and that by my owne merits I cannot attaine to the kingdom of heauen: neuertheleſſe my Lord & Sauiour poſſeſſeth it by a double right, the one is by his natural inheritance, the other by the merit of his paſsion: he is contented with the firſt for himſelfe, and the vertue of the ſecond he hath bequeathed vnto me. God grant that euerie Chriſtian whenſoeuer he ſhall take his laſt ſleepe, may lay his head on this pillow. We adde

                     WHereas the practiſe of the Romaniſts is firſt to abſolue, & then to impoſe ſatisfactions, the diſpute of theſe Apologiſts is contrarily, firſt to intreat of ſatisfaction, and afterward of the point of abſolution. But to come to the matter, whereunto in this queſtion we need not to replie much, ſeeing our Aduerſaries haue herein ſo little to obiect:
                  2 They mention two points, abſolution, and the ceremonie vſed therein, which is impoſition of hands: but it ſeemeth not that they vrge the matter of abſolution it ſelfe. And indeed the power of abſolution, whether it be generall or particular, whether in publike or in priuate, it is See our Seruice booke in both. profeſſed in out Church: where both in her publike Seruice is proclaimed pardon and abſolution vpon all Penitents, and a priuate applying of abſolution vnto particular Penitents by the office of the Miniſter; and greater power then this no man hath receiued from God. And now we deliuer

Notwithſtanding it were well they would haue had the moderation, with P. Lombard, to diſcerne aright of mans iuriſdiction in the office of abſolution, as namely to vnderſtand, by that ſaying of Chriſt vnto the Paſtors of the Church, [* whoſe ſins you remit on earth, they are remitted in heauen]

                     OVr Aduerſaries haue now at length brought vs vnto the chiefe arch, and that we may ſo ſay, the higheſt pinnacle of their Romiſh Temple, to wit, primarie and plenarie iuriſdiction of their Popes ouer all Biſhops, which they ſeeke to deriue from the pretended ſupremacie of S. Peter ouer all the other Apoſtles; and the foundation hereof they lay vpon their expoſition of this word, Rocke: which is their laſt refuge in all their diſputes. Therefore will it concerne them to maintaine this hold, which they endeuour to do, eſpecially by the teſtimonies of ſome Fathers: whereunto we anſwerably appeale, firſt concerning the exceptions vſed by Proteſtants, ſhewing that

                  SECT. 2.
                  2 The now Romiſh purpoſe is knowne to intend, that if the word, Rocke, ſhould betoken Peter, therupō preſently to build a monarchical palace, which they call 
                        See the Sect. 8.

4 It is true that the Centuriſts haue taken exceptions vnto the ſayings of Optatus, and Arnobius: and therefore would we further know whether their exceptions be true. Optatus ſaid, that Peter had his name Cephas, as ſignifying Caput, that is, head, from the Greeke word

                  SECT. 3.
                  6 This queſtion hath bene often debated, whether by [Rocke] is meant Chriſt, whom S. Peter confeſſed, when he ſaid, Thou art Chriſt the ſonne of the liuing God:] or the perſon of S.

                  7 We may adde vnto this Synode of Fathers one, whom the Apologiſts haue placed in their firſt Chapter for the ſupreme patron of their faith; and who ſitting in the ſeate, and (as they call the Romane Biſhopricke) chaire of S. Peter, euē S. Gregory, ſaith plainly thus: Apoſtolus dicit, 1. Cor. 3. Aliud fundamentum nemo poteſt ponere praeter id quod poſitum eſt, quod eſt Chriſtus Ieſus ipſe Dei atque hominum mediator, qui ad ipſum Apoſtolorum principem ait. [Tu es Petrus, & ſuper hanc petrā, &c.] Ipſe enim eſt petra, à qua nomen Petrus accepit. Greg. in Pſal. Poenitent. in illa verba, [Initio tu, Domine.] 
                     Christ named himſelf the Rocke. Therefore M. Caluin had iuſt cauſe to ſay, that he In Petro fundatam eſſe Eccleſiam, quia dictum eſt, [Tu es Petrus:] ſic aliqui Patres.—Subiungit: Neque hic ideo Patrum authoritatem repudio, quia eorum teſtimonijs deſtituor ad probandum quod dico, ſi citate libeat; ſed quia in re tam clara diſceptans moleſtus eſſe Lectoribus nolo. Caluinus Inſtitut. lib. 4. cap. 6. §. 6. As for moſt of the teſtimonies produced out of the Fathers for the contrary expoſition, they vnderſtand by Rocke, by a metonymicall implication, the Rocke Chriſt, whom Peter confeſſed.
                      
                     refuſed not the teſtimonies of Antiquitie herein, as being forlorne of their patronage, but for feare of wronging his Readers, by ſome tedious ſuperfluitie.
                  8 Theſe places are not vnknowne vnto our Aduerſaries, which neceſſarily ruinate the principall foundation of Popedome, which they labour ſeriouſly to fortifie, anſwering vnto ſuch obiected authorities of Fathers; but (alas) ſo weakly, as though they meant to preuaricate in their cauſe. For we are readie to ſhew,

Peter, that is, no otherwiſe to profeſſe that faith and confeſsion to be the Rocke, then as it was S. Peters faith, and S. Peters confeſſion.
                  10 But the Fathers in their fore-cited teſtimonies were ſo farre from reſpecting Peter, in expounding faith, or confeſsion of Chriſt, to be the Rocke, that they did preciſely exempt and ſeparate him from it, diſtinguiſhing therein betweene the Rocke and Peter, as betweene hanc and hunc, that is, this Rock, and him, which is Peter; ſo

Peter to be both the faith confeſſed, and the confeſſor; both the foundation, and the builder; both mee and thee, this and the other; Chriſt, and Peter himſelfe.

                  SECT. 5.
                  11 That (in the ſayings of the Fathers) which S. Peter confeſſed, was the Rocke: but S. Peter did confeſſe Chriſt, and not himſelfe: Ergo (in the Fathers meanings) not Peter, but Chriſt was the Rocke. And the truth of the ſame interpretation of the Fathers, may be further illuſtrated and euinced by a plaine, and not improbable ſuppoſition; by admitting ſome godly & faithful men in the dayes of our Sauiour, to haue beleeued (according vnto S. Peters confeſſion) [Chriſt to be the eternall ſonne of God,] who notwithſtanding had neuer heard of the perſonall faith, or yet ſo much as of the name of S. Peter. From this we may thus argue: Either were ſuch beleeuers not built vpon the Rocke, and ſo ſome ſanctified and faithfull beleeuer in Chriſt ſhould not be built vpon the Rocke: or if any ſuch were truly built vpon the Rocke, who neuer beleeued in S. Peter, then the word Rocke hath no neceſſarie reference or reſpect vnto S. Peter.
                  12 This ſuppoſition may not be iudged friuolous, ſeeing that Origen who is one of the moſt ancient Fathers, doubted not to ſay, that Quod ſi nos quoque loquuti fuerimus, quod dixit Petrus, [Tu es Chriſtus filius Dei viui:] tanquā non accepta reuelatione à carne & ſanguine, ſed à luce corda noſtra illuceſcēte, à Patre, qui in c

Paul witneſſeth (ſaith he) vnto the Corinthians, ſaying, that the Rocke was Chriſt?

                  15 The ſafeſt and moſt iuſtifiable manner of interpretation of the Scripture (as the Fathers teach) is, to expound Scripture by the analogie of Scripture: thereby allowing vnto God that right, which a man will permit vnto enery man, which is, to be the beſt expoſitor of himſelfe.

                  28 The reaſon of that feaſt of the chaire of Antioch was, As may be gathered out of S. Auguſtine. becauſe the epiſcopall and ordinarie ſetled Miniſterie in the Churches (by which the faith of Chriſt hath euer ſince bene maintained) then and there firſt began: or rather, As may be obſerued both out of

                  29 But the Romiſh inference, which from the feſtiuall of that See of S. Peter, doth conclude a ſupremacy of iuriſdiction ouer all other Apoſtles, is by our

                           uity he becometh obſcure: and whether he meane that the Sermo 15. de Sanctis, attributed vnto S. Auguſtine, were but counterſet, ſeeing that feaſt is not found mentioned in any very ancient writer, whether Greeke or Latin, or whether he meane that they were friuolouſly applied for aduantaging Peters iuriſdiction ouer the other Apoſtles in the Romiſh maner, either of them he might haue intended, without contempt of the obiected Fathers.
                      
                     Danaeus iuſtly called friuolous, returning it, as he doth, Ergo laus iſta non ad Romanos, ſed ad Antiochenos pertinet. Danaeus in the ſame place by them cited: for the feaſt of the Chaire of S. Peter at. Rome, is (in reſpect) but of yeſterdayes inuention.

Peters monarchicall power, and tranſcendent authoritie ouer all the Apoſtles of Chriſt and the whole Church of God, by the vertue of one word Rocke; but confuted by the expreſſe expoſitions

of §. 3. Fathers, the ſtrength of neceſſarie §. 5. conſequences, the feebleneſſe of their owne §. 4. anſwers, the direct §. 7. Analogie of Scriptures, and the ingenuous §. 6. confeſſions of their owne Doctors: inſomuch as that they may be thought in ſtead of a Rocke, to haue built their foundation of Popedome vpon the ſands.
                  31 Their ſecond endeuour hath bene as hapleſſe, collecting a preheminence of authoritie in Peter from onely §. 8. titles of Head, Chiefe, Prince: which haue bene in §. 8. antiquitie attributed vnto other Apoſtles: who (by the §. 9. confeſſion of our Aduerſaries) were equalled with S. Peter both in the power of Order, and of Iuriſdiction: according vnto the euidence of §. 9. 
                     Scripture, reporting the promiſes made vnto S. Peter, or the acts done by him.
                  32 Wherefore for their laſt ſtrength they haue bene glad to lay hold vpon the weake ſupport of a ceremoniall feaſt: all which do fully aſcertaine vs of the vncertainty of their claime, & embolden vs to appeale vnto any godly Reader to iudge betweene vs, whether it be not leſſe preiudiciall vnto Apoſtolike function to eſteeme the Apoſtle S. Peter to haue bene in paſtorall iuriſdiction onely equall vnto the reſt (though for orders ſake precedent,) then that all the other Apoſtles ſhould be ſubiected vnto one. From Antioch we are conſtrained to trauell vnto Rome.
               
            
            
               CHAP. XVIII. Of the primacie of the Romane See: and first of the diſpoſition of Pope Leo in that claime.
               
               THE ROMISH APOLOGIE.
               
                  As concerning the Primacie of the Romane See, the Centuriſts ſay 
                  Centur. 5. cap. 10. col. 1262 line 30. Leo verie painfully goeth about to proue, that ſingular preheminence was giuen to Peter aboue the Apoſtles, and that thence aroſe the Primacie of the Romane Church: and Beza further ſaith 
                  Confeſſ. Geneuae, c. 7. ſect. 12. and Whitaker de Concilijs contra Bellarminum, pag. 37. paulò ante medium, ſaith, De Leone primo non laboro. magnus ille fuit Antichriſtiani regni architectus: and yet ibidem pag. 34. circa medium, he ſaith, of Leo, Fuit ille quidem doctus & pius Epiſcopus, ſed fuit tamen magis ambitioſus, &c.
                   It is manifeſt that Leo in his Epiſtles doth clearely breath forth the arrogancy of the Antichriſtian Romane ſea.
               
                  THE PROTESTANTS APPEALE: First ſhewing that the Proteſtants in their cenſure of Pope Leo, are not contradictorie vnto themſelues.
                  
                  SECT. 1.
                  
                     EXcept our Aduerſaries did thinke that Peter could beget a Pope, and that they are able to tranſlate his ancient chaire of Antioch vnto Rome, they would neuer haue ſo much buſied themſelues to proue either the prerogatiue of Peters perſon, or the honour of his See: yet may we not contemne their ſtrength of prouing this, before that we haue tried it. Now then

                     Whitaker is brought by the Apologiſts in their marginall notes, commending Pope Leo for an holy man, and yet alſo condemning him as too ambitious. We anſwer, as their Ieſuite Maldonate hath obſerued, that the Quaerunt quis corum maior eſſet. Matth 18. 1. 2. Non dub

                     diſciples of Chriſt (among whom S. Peter was one) were reprehended by Chriſt for affecting ambitiouſly to reigne ouer others: 
                     Non hic agi de prima in gubernanda Eccleſia dignitate, etſi eo etiam ſenſu hunc locum alicubi (epiſt. 53. ad Pulcheriam Auguſtam, de ambitu Anatolij) apud Leonem magnum legi memini. Idem comment. in Marc. 9 34. See a ſo Ianſen. Concord. in haec loca, Petrum vnum fuiſſe. 
                     which Pope Leo doth interprete of that ambition, wherewith one deſireth to haue the ſupreme dignity in the gouernance of the Church. And will our Aduerſaries denie, that S. Peter and other Apoſtles were holy men? If ſuch were the defect of the domeſticall attendants of our Sauiour, why may not thoſe, who are in reſpect but pilgrimes from his preſence, be ſubiect vnto the like default without any preiudice vnto their ſubſtantiall faith, and other degrees of holineſſe? Is not the Moone light, except it be at the full? or men not to be called godly, except they be perfect? As for Pope Leo, he was ſo peremptorie, that for his preſumption he found in his time ſome brotherly checks: for
               
               
                  
                     That pretended Iuriſdiction, which Leo aſſumed, was croſſed in his time, (and conſequently the taxation of Proteſtants iuſtified,) in the proceedings of the generall Councell of Calcedon, in the aſſembly of ſixe hundred Biſhops.

                     this Canon of the Councell was afterwards reiected by Pope Leo, becauſe it thought that the Romane See had her preheminence onely from humane authority, and not from the ordinance of God. This may be as a glaſſe, wherein our reader may perceiue the right complexion of our Aduerſaries, and the antiquitie of our profeſſion.

Thus we ſee what our Aduerſaries onely would proue, and now our diſcreet Reader may iudge, whether it be more likely that the Epiſtle of a Pope, or the Epiſtle of an vniuerſall Councell could be rather ſubiect vnto the fraudulent corruption of a Scribe, eſpecially after that he ſhall call to mind the proteſtation vſed by S.

                     From theſe examples it may appeare, (ſaith he) that the Popes of ancient times did not ſo much preſume vpon their authoritie, for they were humble: and did purge themſelues in their owne Synods, yea and Leo ſubmitted himſelfe vnto all the puniſhments which were contained in the lawes of the Emperour Martianus. Neither yet do Proteſtants (who haue bene obiected by the Apologiſts) make Leo guiltie of the now Romiſh ambition, which conſiſteth in vſurpation of an abſolute power of making all Eccleſiaſticall lawes, of creating all Patriarchs and Church-officers, of receiuing all Appeales, of determining all cauſes, of deciding all matters of faith, of diſpoſing of all temporall Crownes, and of diſpenſing of Indulgences and Pardons: all which were almoſt as eaſily confuted as propounded.
                  
                     The Concluſion.
                     8 Knowing that Pope Leo was ſubiect vnto that ambition, which he §. 1. himſelfe noteth to haue bene in ſome of the holy Apoſtles: and that indeed he was ambitious, except, to free him from that ſtaine, we ſhall condemne the Emperour Theodoſius of §. 1.

                  4 And if Iulius had bene ſo neglected as not to receiue due intelligence of the indiction of a generall Councell, his challenge (by the vertue of ancient Canons) might haue bene iuſt, although not ſingular, but common with other Patriarchs, who in the like caſe haue made the like complaint. For how could the Councell be called generall, or vniuerſall, whereunto the principall members are not called?

                     to come vnto the Synode, but by delayes refuſed to be there; then Talaſius Biſhop of Cappadocia, moued this Councel not to expect them any longer, but notwithſtanding their abſence to proceed. Here we find a generall Councell, wherein the Pope was not preſent, either by himſelfe, or by any of his Legates.
                  6 Nay, the Biſhops of Rome were in thoſe times ſo impotent and vnable to gather any Oecumenicall or generall Councell, that it is by them obſerued out of ancient monuments, that Pope Leo with his Prouincial Councell was glad to intreate licence of the godly Emperour Leo Papa ad Theodoſium Auguſtum: Concilium vniuerſale intra Italiam, ſicut Synodus quae ob hanc cauſam Romae conuenerat mecum petit, Clementia veſtra concedat. Haec ibi. Ecce vniuerſalem Synodum per Synodum, vbi Papa praeſidet, ab Imperatore intra Italiam petitam. Cardin. Cuſanus Concord. lib. 2. cap. 7.

                  7 As they hold it neceſſarie that Popes ſhould be made acquainted with the celebration of euerie generall Councell; (for how elſe could it haue bene called vniuerſall?) ſo ought they to thinke it, at leaſt requiſite, that the ſame Popes ſhould be perſonally preſent in ſome one generall Councell, or elſe ſhew vs ſome ſenſible reaſon of their abſence. Their Cardinall for excuſe of their perſonall abſence from the firſt ſeuen generall Councels, hath coniectured two ſpeciall reaſons, which may not be pretermitted.
                  8 Firſt, Ego ſuſpicor duas fuiſſe cauſas quare Papa non Concilijs generalibus perſonaliter affuit: prima, quia non videbatur conuenire vt caput ſequeretur membra, cum potius membra

                     becauſe it ſeemed vnto the ancient Popes (ſaith he) a thing inconuenient, that the head (for ſo was the Pope) ſhould follow the members. Of what ſpirit this may ſauor of, their old preacher Ferus wil ſignifie: Membrum eſt vnum altero nobilius, nihilominus tamen omnibus eſt commune quòd ſunt membra vnius corporis
                           •
                         in hoc vnum non praeſtat alij, vnum alteri non inuidet, nec inferius contemnit. Sic in Eccleſia quodlibet membrum ſua operatione alijs inſeruit. Ferus comm in Act. 8. 
                     Although (ſaith he) one member be more excellent then another, yet this is common vnto all, that euery one is a member to the ſame bodie: neither doth one either diſdaine or enuie the good of another, but euery one will be ſeruiceable to ſtrengthen another.

                     The ſecond cauſe was (ſaith their Cardinall) for that in the East Churches, and Councels, the Emperour was placed in the higheſt ſeate; therefore the Popes (leſt they might be occaſion of tumult) would not go themſelues, but ſent their Legates. This reaſon ſeemeth to be a feather of the ſame wing of pride, which was condemned by our Sauiour, who (as their owne Cùm dixit Chriſtus [Vae vobis, qui diligitis primas cathedras] ibi non res ipſas, ſed affectus damnabat. Ianſenius Concord in cum locum. Qui minor eſt (inquit Chriſtus, Luc. 9.) maior eſt: quia quanto quis humilior, tanto Chriſto ſimilior.

a ſtrife which aroſe among his Diſciples, contending who ſhould be the chiefe, he ſaid, that he who was the leaſt, was the greateſt; teaching thereby, ſaith their Stella, that whoſoeuer are ſpiritually minded, ſhould not contend for the vppermoſt, but for the loweſt roomes.

Whether now are we rather to thinke, that a thouſand foure hundred ſixtie and three orthodoxall Biſhops could haue bene ſo iniurious, or ſome fewe Popes ſo ambitious; which is our preſent theame? And who ſeeth not, by their Cardinals anſwer, that for the ſpace of the firſt fiue hundred yeares, and in pureſt times of the Church, it was held as a Catholike truth, to preferre in place an Emperour before a Pope.

                  The first two are against their preſumed abſolute ſufficiency in the Pope alone without a Councell, and his authority to commaund it.
                  SECT. 5.
                  11 That this myſtery may be more clearly diſplaied, we will vſe the light of method, reducing all the points of their pretended Primacy, for order ſake, vnto theſe fiue prepoſitions, 1. without, 2. before, 3. in, 4. after, and 5. aboue a Councell.

For thus ſhould they haue no neceſſary reaſon to alledge that Scripture, [Matth. 18. 20. See it obiected aboue.
                      
                     when two or three are gathered together, &c.] for gathering of a Councell. The ſecond propoſition followeth.
                  13 Before that our Aduerſaries will acknowledge any Councell to be truly called, they hold it neceſſarie that the Pope do authorize it; which we haue heard affirmed by 
                        See aboue §. 2. Ieſuits, & confuted by their owne 
                        See aboue §. 2. Doctors, as derogatory from the true tenour of pureſt antiquitie. Next is
               
               
                  The third Demonſtration, vnfolding foure new and notable deformities, and eſpecially a Romiſh ſpirituall tyrannie, and a preſumption Anabaptiſticall, concerning the Popes behauiour in a Councell.
                  SECT. 6.
                  14 In the Synode, when it is called and aſſembled, we may perceiue many Romiſh aberrations and reuolts from true antiquitie. The firſt is in making their Pope the neceſſarie Generale Concilium eſt, in quo nemo rectè praeſidet, niſi ſummus Pontifex, aut alius eius nomine. Bellar. lib. 1. de Concil. cap. 4. 
                     preſident of all generall Councels, either by himſelfe, or by his delegate: eſpecially ſeeing they beleeue that the Etſi Legati ſint nomine Pontificis, tamen—non habent priuilegiū non errandi, quod habet Pontifex. Bellarm. lib. 2. de Concil. cap. 11. §. Praeterea. 
                     Legates of the Pope haue not the ſame priuiledge of not erring, which the Pope hath in himſelf: for this ſeemeth to imply a great incongruity, if not impiety, that the Pope (when he might be at any generall Synode) ſhould ſend his Legate, and to abſent himſelfe. As for example, in the laſt Councell of Trent, which continued the ſpace of fifteene yeares, wherein no one Tridentinum Concilium habuit Praeſides vice ſummi Pō
                        tiſicis tres Legatos Papae—ſub Paulo tertio, Iulio 3. Pio 4. Vega lib. 1. de Iuſtif. cap. 5. Pope appeared in his owne perſon: ſhall we allow them to anſwer for this laſt Councel, as they haue done for the ſeuen firſt, viz. It is not meete that the Pope, the head, ſhould follow the bodie? as though it were meete the head ſhould be diſtracted from the bodie.
                  15 Nay, but if (as they ſay truly) the Concilium Apoſtolorum primum fuit, à quo formam acceperunt alia omnia Concilia. Bellarm. lib. 2. de Concil cap. 2. 
                     Councell of the Apoſtles Act. 15. ſhould be a preſident and forme of all orthodoxall Councels, and that alſo S. Peter (vnto whom their Pope will be thought to ſucceed) In Act. 15. Petrus fuit in Concilio primo. Idem, lib. 3. de verbo Dei, cap. 5. §. Sextum argumentum. 
                     was perſonally preſent in that Councel: then are their now Popes defectiue in this point, who by their abſence make their owne body, that is, the Church Acephalon or headleſſe.
                  16 Secondly, Proteſtantes requirunt in Concilio, vt liberum ſit Theologos non minus quim Epiſcopos voces deciſiuas proferre in Concilijs. 
                     in a Synode Proteſtants require, that it may be free aſwell for Prieſts and learned Diuines, as for Biſhops to haue definitiue voices: this by the now Romiſh doctrine is denied, as being Reſpondeo, hoc eſſe contra formam Concilij. Bellarm. lib. 1. de Concil. cap. 21. 
                     contrarie vnto the forme of a Councell. And in behalfe of their Biſhops, who for want of learning, may be thought incompetent Iudges of the myſteries of faith: their Cardinall Bellarmine anſwereth, that Reſpondeo, Epiſcopos habere authoritatem iudicandi, non quia doctr

                        unt, ſed quia ſunt perſonae publicae. Bellarm. lib. 1. de Concil. cap. 16. 
                     Biſhops haue authority of iudging in Synods, not as they are learned, but as they are publike perſons; as if their ignorance could not preiudice

their iudgment. But their Cardinall Arelatenſis hath long ſince confuted this, by the practiſe of the foreſaid Apoſtolicall Synod: which our Aduerſaries haue acknowledged to be the platforme of all other orthodoxall Councels; In Act. 15. Viſum eſt nobis.] Vox [nobis] refertur ad illud quod praeceſſit, vbi nominantur Apoſtoli & ſeniores: & verbum [Viſum eſt] non conſultationem ſed deciſionem ſignificat.

Afterwards he manifeſteth by the example of the firſt Councell of Nice, and the late Romiſh Councels of Conſtance and Laterane, that other learned presbyters, beſides Biſhops, had iudiciall voices in Synods.
                  17 Finally, their preacher Stella diſplaying the ignorance of many Biſhops who were called at the Councell of Trent, and carried with them other learned Diuines, by whom they might be illuminated, ſaith, that he could Hi Epiſcopi ſecum ducunt doctos Theologos, qui ipſos illuminent, vt in noſtro Trident. Concilio noſtris temporibus contigit. In hac quidem re non poſſum mihi á riſu temperare: melius quidem Epiſcopi facerent, ſi Epi

                     not containe laughter at the ſight of that deformitie; and therefore held it better that thoſe Biſhops ſhould reſigne their Biſhopricks vnto the learned Diuines, becauſe in theſe Biſhops (ſaith he) is veriſied the ſaying of our Sautour; If the blind leade the blind, both fall into the ditch: and conſequently their former reaſon muſt be thought to depend but onely vpon a blind diſtinction.
                  18 Thirdly, in a Councell we know, and they confeſſe, Non eſt numerus in Concilio adeò neceſſarius ſicut libertas & vnanimitas. Cardin. C
                              •
                           ſanus, lib. 2. de Concord. Cathol cap. 3. 
                     the number is not more neceſſarie then the liberty and vnanimity of their ſuffrages and voices. Now they aſcribe this prerogatiue vnto the Pope, Pontifex mittere ſolet Legatos inſtructos de ſententia Apoſtolicae ſedis cum ea conditione, vt ſi Concilium conſentiat cum indicio Apoſtolicae ſedis, formetur Decretum: ſi minùs, differatur decreti formatio done Romanus Pontifex reſpondeat. Bellar. lib. 2. de Conc. cap. 11. §. Quod. 
                     to ſend his Legates to the Councell, but with the inſtructions and directions of the Apoſtolike See: ſo that, if the Councell will conſent vnto the iudgement of the See Apoſtolike, they may then forme and frame a Decree: otherwiſe the matter must be deferred vntill they ſhould vnderſtand the pleaſure of his Holineſſe. The reaſon why they would tie the Councell vnto the Popes predetermination is, becauſe Aliquando Legati mittuntur ad Concilium cum inſtructione ſedis Apoſtolicae:—Si Patres conſentiant ac definiant diſſentientibus Legatis, errare poſſunt, ſicut contigit in Conc. Epheſino 2. 
                     if that the Fathers of the Councell (ſay they) or the Legates themſelues ſhall iudge contrary vnto their inſtructions, they may erre.
                  
                  19 They produce for example in the firſt kind, the ſecond Councel of Epheſus; in the ſecond ſort, a Councell of Conſtantinople: and finally ſet it downe for a concluſion, that Secundò ſi Concilia conſenſerint Legatis contra inſtructionem Pontificis agentibus, dici non poſſunt legitima, quia pugnant cum capite, & ſic errauit Conſtantinopolitanum Concilium, tempore Nicolai primi. Bellar lib. 2. de Conc. cap. 11. per integrum cap.
                      
                     the Councels, if they conſent againſt the Popes inſtructions, they are not to be acknowledged as lawfull, becauſe they are deuided from the head. This is that which we haue named a ſpirituall tyranny, and indeed a very ſtifling of that liberty, which was alwaies the very naturall and vitall breath of a lawfull Councel: but when their Iudges like mil-horſes are thus blinded with preiudice, it is no maruell though their Cardinall In condendis ſtatutis generalibus Papa non tantam poteſtatem habet, quantam adula
                           •
                        ores eidem tribunt: ſcilicet quòd ipſe tantùm ſtatuere poſſit, alijs conſulentibus. Cardin, Cuſanus Concord, Cathol. lib. 2. cap. 12. Cuſanus held ſuch voicers to be no Iudges, but only Counſellers, and called the defenders of the forenamed authority of their Pope, ſlatterers: and that iuſtly, as hath bene

proued by the ancient Councels of Siue Pontifex in definiendo ſtudium adhibeat, ſiue non adhibeat, modò tamen controuerſiam definiat, infallibiliter certè definiet: atque adeò re ipſa vtitur authoritate ſibi à Chriſto conceſſa. Greg. Valent. Ieſ. Analyſ. lib. 8. cap. 3. §. Reſpondeo ſiue. 
                     Epheſus, Conſtantinople, and Calcedon, which haue neglected the Popes inſtructions.
                  20 Laſtly, in a generall Councell, he that ſhall claime the power of pronouncing a definitiue ſentence, ought to performe great diligence for diſquiſition of the truth. Yet do their Ieſuits ſo much adore their Pope, as to make him an immediate Oracle of truth: for q if the Pope (ſaith he) do determine any controuerſy, his definition & iudgement is infallible, whether, to that end, he vſe any diligence, or not. This is an Anabaptiſticall Enthuſiaſmus, as (if occaſion permit) ſhall be ſhewed in due place.
                  21 For this preſent we oppoſe the iudgement of Ferus (whom our Aduerſaries reckō among the 
                        See in the Catalogue before this Booke, at the name Ferus.

This were a Primacic indeed, but their learned Cardinall ſaith, that this claime is Non tamen eſt hoc verum, quòd in Synodo ritè congregata, admiſſis admittendis & ritè celebrata, authoritas ita etiam ab ipſo capite dependeat, quòd niſi in quacunque definitione conſentiat, definitio illa nulla ſit.

                  Our Concluſion.
                  SECT. 8.
                  24 We are now at leiſure to reckon the gaine which our Aduerſaries haue got by obiecting vnto Proteſtants the practiſe of §. 1. Pope Iulius: from whence they haue §. 2. impertinently concluded the Popes Primacie in the ordering of Councels, & by the oppoſition of a general Councel, wherin the fame Iulius was Legate, haue found an euidēt proofe of the Popes §. 3. & 4. ſubiectiō: and wheras they vndertake to defend the now Papall Iuriſdictiō in reſpect of the ordering of a general Councell, they haue bewraied manifold Romiſh reuolts frō primitiue antiquity. Firſt, §. 5. they teach that the Popes ſole authority is, in it ſelfe ſufficient, without the helpe of a Councell, to direct the Church infallibly in all neceſſarie truth: which aſſertion is §. 5. confeſſed to impugne the wiſdome of all ancient Churches, & maketh all Councels to haue bene, in effect, ſuperfluous.
                  
                  25 Secondly, if the Councell muſt be gathered, then do they §, 2. appropriate the power thereof vnto the Pope, which claime is §. 2. confeſſed to be contrarie vnto the ancient practiſe of the Church in the calling of generall Councels.
                  26 Thirdly, when a Councell is called, the Popes ordinarie want of preſ
                        •
                     nce in Councels, wherein he claimeth a preſidence, is §. 6. confeſſed to contradict the practiſe of the firſt Councell Apoſtolicall. His allowing of Biſhops onely to haue §. 6. 
                     definitiue voices in a Councell, is §. 6. confeſſed to decline from the common vſe of Councels, euen of later times. His preinſtructions, wherewith he preoccupateth his Biſhops, and limiteth them what they ſhall ſay, doth turne iudicium into praeiudicium, and is confeſſed to ouerthrow the ancient liberty of their voices, wherein conſiſteth the life & ſoule of a Councell.

Such is the now Romiſh challenge by them who would make the Pope, as it were α and ω in the iudgement of the Church, and in pretence of ancient proofes ouerthrow the confeſſed forme and profeſſion of all antiquitie.

               THE ROMISH APOLOGIE.
               
                  S. Cyprian though a Biſhop of Africke (who liued Anno 240.) is charged by the Century writers for his affirming

                     FRom Pope Iulius they are aſcended an hundred yeares nearer the riſing of the Sunne of righteouſneſſe, Chriſt our Lord, euen vnto the age of S. Cyprian the glorious Martyr of Chriſt. Neither do we find in all the writings of our Aduerſaries any Father more generally noted, for proofe of any point of Romiſh doctrine, then S. Cyprian is for the defence of the Popes Primacy: nor yet in Cyprian any one teſtimonie more vehemently vrged, almoſt in all their diſputes, then are theſe now alledged, which the Romaniſts do ſo confidently preſſe, as though in them they had diſplaied the enſignes of victorie. Hereunto therefore muſt we addreſſe our anſwer, requeſting our Aduerſaries, that (caſting away all preoccupation of perſonall and partiall reſpects) they would be contented to ſtand vnto this ſo honourable a witneſſe, who hath teſtified a glorious profeſſion of the name of Chriſt, and ſealed the truth thereof with his bloud, which was ſhed by the hands of Infidels: and whoſe iudgement we ſhall willingly admit as an vmpier in this controuerſie.

                     the whole Councel of Carthage vnder Cyprian did profeſſe: furthermore calling it a terror tyrannicall for any one Biſhop to impoſe vpon his fellow Biſhops a neceſsitie of obedience. Which Canon now ſpecified, was eſpecially and purpoſely intended againſt the Biſhop of Rome: for (as their owne laſt, and moſt authorized Binius plainly teſtifieth) Alludit ad Decretum Stephani Papae, qui aliter ſentientibus poenam excommunicationis comminatus eſt.

This we take to be an infallible demonſtratiō of Cyprians iudgement, to teach vs that the now chaire of Rome is of ſuch a new frame and faſhion, as which S. Cyprian would neuer haue approued. We furthermore inſiſt in
               
               
                  A fourth Demonstration of S. Cyprian his doctrine, concerning the Mother Church.
                  SECT. 6.
                  10 That the eclipſe of iudgement in our Aduerſaries, may yet more viſibly appeare, we approach yet nearer to the Motherhood of their Church.
                  11 We find one ſentence of S. Cyprian much magnified by our Aduer|

ſaries, and in the mouth of almoſt euerie Nouice, to wit, Non habet Deum patrem, (inquit Cyprianus) qui non habet Eccleſiam matrem. Coſterus Ieſ. Apolog. part. 3. 
                     No man can haue God to his Father, who hath not the Church to his mother. Hence they labour to proue the Church of Rome to be the abſolute and onely Catholike Mother, without which there is no ſaluation. Who would not now think that the Romaniſts, as often as they vrge this ſentence, did beleeue it to haue bene ſpoken by S. Cyprian, in behalfe of the Church of Rome? But this is their boldneſſe, for the ſame ſentence is by S. Cyprian purpoſely applied againſt that cauſe which Stephen the then Pope of Rome vrged; who is confeſſed to haue Cyprianus cum Stephanus à ſua communione eum repelleret, & Epiſcopos ab illo ex Affrica legatos, nec ad ſermoné communis colloquij admitteret, & praeciperet vniuerſae fraternitati, ne quis

                     denied Cyprian his communiō, & to haue forbidden that any ſhould ſo much as receiue his meſſengers into houſe, or Inne: the which Pope, Cyprian, in the words immediatly following the alledged ſentēce, doth accuſe of Cum natiuitas Chriſtianorum in baptiſmo ſit, baptiſmi autem regeneratio & ſanctificatio apud ſolam ſponſam Chriſti ſit, quae parere ſpiritualiter & generare filios Deo poſſiti vbi, & ex qua, & cui natus eſt, qui filius Ecclſiae non eſt? Vt habere quis poſſit Deum patrem ante Eccleſiam matrem? Cùm verò nulla omninò haereſis, neque aliquod ſchiſma habere ſalutaris baptiſmi ſanctificationem foris poſſit, cut in tantum Stephani fratris noſtri obſtinatio dura prorupit? &c. Cyprian.

                  12 Now then let our Apologiſts deliberate how they will anſwer their owne obiection retorted vpon them: S. Cyprian Biſhop of Carthage, who liued 240 yeares after Christ, did himſelfe (as we haue proued) together with foure ſcore and eight Biſhops of Africke and Numidia, denie the Popes

                  12 This, we thinke, might worke in our Aduerſaries, at leaſt, a bluſh, and teach them to forbeare to aſſume S. Cyprian for a Patron of the Romane Primacy, Chaire, and Motherhood: except they would intend to proue concerning S. Cyprian, that the ſame man of God and holy Martyr of Chriſt, was neither Saint nor Martyr, but (becauſe an Aduerſarie vnto the Popes Decree) vndoubtedly a damnable ſchiſmatike.

                  THE PROTESTANTS APPEALE: By an hiſtoricall relation of the Acts of Pope Victor, containing in it ſufficient matter of iuſtification of the former obiections.
                  
                  SECT. 1.
                  
                     WE wiſh that our Apologiſts had followed the equitie which the gouernour in the Act. 25. 27. Acts did in behalfe of S. Paul, not only to relate exceptions, but ſhew the reaſon why; which would cleare this matter, and throughly iuſtifie our cauſe concerning Victor. It were folly to ſtand vpon his ſayings, where we ſee his doings: and becauſe our Aduerſaries do much and often obiect the example of Victor, as though in him they were become victorious in their cauſe, we deſire to be tried by our euidence.
                  2 The hiſtorie is large, but memorable, and neceſſarie for the reſolution of this queſtion: whereof we haue ſummarily compriſed the moſt pertinent points, according as our learned aduerſaries haue related thē out of Euſebius, & digeſted in their late volumes of Councels by their approued Surius, thus.
                  3 Euſeb. lib. 5. cap. 22. de Victore in hunc modum ſcribit: Cùm quaeſtio erat de ſeruando Paſchate, Epiſcopi Eccleſiae Aſianae ſeruandam magis, à veteribus ſibi traditam conſuetudinem confirmabant: In quibus Polycrates, qui in ijs primatum agere videbatur; Ego (inquit) ſecundùm Traditionem omnium Patrum meorum obſeruo eorum duntaxat, quos ab initio ſecutus ſum: ſeptem namque ex Parentibus meis per ordinem fuerunt Epiſcopi, ego octauus, qui omnes ita obſeruārunt hunc diem. Vnde ſexaginta quinque annos aetatis gerens, in nomine Domini multorum orbis Epiſcoporum notitiam pleniſſimè habens, & ſanctis Scripturis intendens, non perturbor ex his, quae in terrorem proferuntur. Multitudo Epiſcoporum nimia ſententiam meam confirmat. Sed ad haec Victor, Romanae Eccleſiae Epiſcopus, pertinaciùs agens, paſſim totius Aſiae & Vicinarum Prouinciarum Eccleſias à communionis ſocietate abſcindere nititur, tanquam in haereſin inclinantes, & literas mittit, quibus omnes ſimul abſque diſcretione ab Eccleſiaſtico foedere ſegregaret. Sed hoc non omnibus placebat Epiſcopis, quin potuis ècontrario ſcribentes ei, iubebant vt magis quae pacis ſunt ageret, & concordiae & vnitati ſtuderet. Denique extant Epiſcoporum literae, quibus aſperiùs obiurgant Victorem, velut inutiliter Eccleſiae commodis conſulentem. Inter quos Irenaeus Victorem arguens, quòd non rectè fecerit abſcindens à corporis vnitate tot & tantas Eccleſias Dei, quae morem ſibi antiquitus traditum cuſtodirent: Polycarpus, inquit, cùm ad vrbem Romam veniſſet, ſub Anacleto ita egerunt de hac quaeſtione interſe, vt in pace coirent, vtque non vnuſquiſque ſententiam ſuam obſtinata contentione defenderet. Neque enim aut Anicetus Polycarpo perſuadere poterat, vt non obſeruaret ea, quae nouerat Iohanuem Diſcipulum Domini noſtri, vel caeteros Apoſtolos, cum quibus ſemper fuit, obſeruâſſe. Neque rurſus Polycarpus Anicetum perſuaſit, vt morem maiorum ſuorum non obſeruaret. Haec apud Surium Tom. 1. Conc. pag. 194. 
                     Where the queſtion aroſe betweene the Greeke and Latine Church about the obſeruation of the day of Easter, the Biſhops of the Church of Aſia diſſented from the opinion of Victor the Biſhop of Rome, amongſt whom Polycrates did write hereof in this manner; I Polycrates (being now threeſcore and fiue yeares old, and ſucceſsiuely the eight after ſeuen Biſhops of my

                  4 Notwithstanding Victor goeth about to excommunicate all the Biſhops of Aſia, as inclining to hereſie, & vndiſcreetly to ſeparate them from the felowſhip of communion, which had bene amongst them: who was therefore diſliked by other Biſhops, commaunding Victor to ſeeke the peace and vnity of the Church. Amongſt others Irenaeus did reproue him, becauſe he diuided ſo many, & ſo worthy Churches
                     
                     from the vnity of the body for obſeruing the ancient traditions of their Fathers, euen from S. Iohn: whereas before time Polycarpus a Greeke Biſhop, and Anicetus, notwithſtanding they could not perſwade one another to the alteration of their diuerſe cuſtomes herein, yes did they preſerue vnity togither.

                  5 The particulars of this ſtorie are euidently acknowledged by our Aduerſaries in theſe their confeſſions: 1. that Extant ipſae literae, quibus aſperius obiurgāt Victorem, velut inutiliter Eccleſiae commodis conſulentem. Bellarm. de Rom. Pont. lib. 2. cap. 19.

                     the Biſhops of Aſia did in a Councell decree to maintaine their ancient custome, for the which cauſe Victor executed his excommunication against them: 3. that Victor Pontifex omnes Orientales & Auſtrales Eccleſias ſimul à communione amputabat, cui tunc inter caeteros excellentiſſimos viros reſtitit Polycrates Aſiae Epiſcoput; & Irenaeus Victorem Pontificem tanquam pacis turbatorem acriter obiurgabat.

                  6 What now can our Apologiſts taxe in our Proteſtant Authors, which may not be iuſtified by antiquitie? They reprehend Victor for arrogancy, and tranſgreſsing of the bounds of his Iuriſdiction in, excommunicating the Churches of Aſia: and the premiſes haue ſhewed, that Euſebius noted Pope Victor as offenſiue herein; Irenaeus reprehended him for being a troubler of Christendome; beſides multitudes of Biſhops in a Councell, who (which could not be without diſclaime of the now pretended Papall iuriſdiction) made Decrees against the ſentence of Victor; and yet were men themſelues of that integritie both of life and doctrine, that notwithſtanding that oppoſition vnto Pope Victor, they haue euer in the Church of Chriſt bene honoured with the memorie of holy and renouned Martyrs.
                  
                  7 By all which we do neceſſarily euince, that the Primitiue antiquitie held it not any Catholike doctrine to beleeue either the ſubiection to the biſhops of Rome to be neceſſarie vnto ſaluation, or his Cathedrall ſentence to be infallible, or that it is a damnable ſtate for a Chriſtian to die in the excommunication of that Church.
                  8 Neuertheleſſe there are not anie Proteſtants who cenſure Victor for vſurping an abſolute power ouer Councels, or arrogating any infallibilitie of iudgement vnto himſelfe, & his ſucceſſors, or to haue bene inſpired with the ſpirit of the 
                        For excommunication of another Church, doth not properly imply an abſolute iuriſdiction; for ſo ſome Biſhops in the Eaſt excommunicated Pope Iulius in the cauſe of Athanaſius. Sozom. lib. 3. cap. 11. & 7. Menas the Patriarch of Conſtantinople did excommunicate Vigilius Biſhop of Rome. Niceph hiſt. lib. 7. cap. 26. how iuſtly, is not now our queſtion. But they doing ſo, did not therby challenge a iuriſdiction ouer the Romane Biſhop, no more then the Church of Geneua could do, if it ſhould excommunicate the Church of England.

flame of ſpirituall ambition, as which all Chriſtendome ſithence could neuer quench. Wherepon we may conclude a iuſtification of the Proteſtants exceptions by the iudgement of notable Martyrs, and other Doctors both of the Eaſt and Weſt Church: from whence iſſueth a confutation of their Romiſh Primacie.

                  Laſtly S. Irenaeus (who liued next after the Apoſtles Scholers, and in the ſame time Victor) is diſliked for his affirming, that 
                  The Century writers, Cent. 2. c. 4. col. 64. line 10. all the Church ought to accord to the Romane Church, in regard of a more powerable principalitie: wherein the Centuriſts charge him with

                  6 Secondly Irenaeus, as hath bene confeſſed, did ſharply reprehend Pope Victor, and notwithſtanding the excommunication which Victor denounced againſt the Aſian Churches, he and other of the Weſt Church did willingly Caeteri dicebant (amongſt whom was Irenaeus) ſe nihilominus cum ijs pacem velle colere.

                  7 To conclude, when our Aduerſaries do argue from a confeſſed ſinceritie of the faith of primitiue Rome, for the authorizing of the now profeſſion of this later one, they make no better conſequence then if a man, who being decrepit would proue that he is of a ſound and perfect bodie, becauſe he was free from crampes in his youth.

                  2 Now whether Proteſtants might not take exception againſt ſuch teſtimonies of Fathers, ſo farre as they ſeeme to affirme that this Lent-faſt was inſtituted by Chriſt, and whether thoſe aboueſaid yonger Romaniſts haue not bene by ſuch teſtimonies deceiued, we may be certified by the generall conſent of our Aduerſaries; At communis opinto Theologorum Scholaſticorum eſt, Quadrageſimarium i

                      doubtfully.
                  3 For we know that when Vibicus did fooliſhly contend for the neceſſitie of the Saturdaies faſt, he was confronted by S. Auguſtine, ſaying;

                     Ego in Apoſtolicis & Euangelicis literis, totoue nouo Teſtamento, animo id reuoluens, video praeceptum eſſe ieiunium; quibus autem diebus non oporteat, praecepto Domini vel Apoſtolorum non inuenio definitum. Aug. epiſt. 86. And after concludeth: Vt quadraginta illi dies ante Paſcha obſeruentur, Eccleſiae conſenſio roborauit. Epiſt. 119. 
                     I reade indeed that we are commanded to fast: but which ought to be the daies of our fasting, I find not preſcribed in the Euangelicall or Apostolicall writings of the new Teſtament: and in concluſion doth grant, that the Lent faſt is a tradition Eccleſiaſticall. S. Auguſtine doth ſometime write of the fortie daies faſt, that it hath a diuine authoritie, but meaneth not an authoritie of precept, but of example, as in Auguſt. ibid. 
                     Elias, Moſes, and Chriſt.
                  
                  4 Laſtly, the Proteſtants take not exception againſt Ignatius, but againſt them who haue corrupted theſe Epiſtles of Ignatius, whoſe writings our Doctor Scultetus (cited by the Apologiſts) affirmeth to haue bene Sunt epiſtolae adulteratae, Scuitetus in the place alledged. pag. 440. 
                     adulterated and corrupted. And this Epiſtle ad Philippenſes is not found in S. Hieromes Catalogue, where he reckoneth the other Epiſtles of Ignatius: which maketh it the rather to be ſuſpected.
                  5 All that our Aduerſaries would ſay, is, that this faſt ought to be obſerued: we onely demaund, by what law? If diuine, then did not S. Auguſtine confute that ſilly diſputer Vrbicus, by diſprouing the neceſſitie of his Saturdaies faſt: if it were from the ordinance of the Church, then it is not of abſolute neceſſitie, but according to the diſcretion of the Church variable and alterable: which in the next place is to be proued. Therefore we ſhew, 
                        Hieron, Catalog. Tit. Ignatius. And for M. Hooker and others, to alledge places out of ſuch a booke, is not altogether to warrant it.
                     
                  
               
               
                  That the manner of Lent faſt vſed anciently, was variable, and alſo may be changed according to the wiſedome of the Church: euen by the confeſsion of our learned Aduerſaries.

                     the Pope hath power to diſpenſe with the Lent-faſt: yea and that the people may abrogate it by a contrarie cuſtome. Therefore may we thinke the Apologiſts, and other our Aduerſaries to be inconſiderate diſputers, whenſoeuer they inſert this tradition of Lent-faſt amongſt doctrines (in their opinion) neceſſarily appertaining vnto the law of faith. But we are contented to heare ſo great an Aduerſarie to haue confeſſed (notwithſtanding the obiected teſtimonies of ancient Fathers) as much, if not more then Proteſtants haue or would deſire.

                     The Kings daughter (ſaith he) is ſaid to be all glorious within, and her rayment to be wrought with needle worke of diuers colors: ſo in the Church where there is one faith, and variety of rites, the diuerſity of obſeruations in the garment may not beget a contentious oppoſition, in the indiſtinct members of one bodie, which is the Church. Howſoeuer, with what reaſon can our Aduerſaries accuſe others of alterations, who themſelues are not altogether preciſe in holding their ancient limits? for we may vnderſtand,

                     Scholer, or rather his counterfeit. From this particular point of Lent faſt we aſcend vnto the generall doctrine of religious faſting, and proue,
               
               
                  That the manner of a publike religious faſting practiſed in the Church of Rome, is in diuerſe reſpects, reproueable by examples of antiquity; from the confeſsion of our learned Aduerſaries.
                  The firſt exception is againſt the indiſcretion of their choice mixed with ſome apparence of hypocriſie.
                  SECT. 5.
                  10 Here we haue not to deale with any politike faſt, but with that only which conſiſteth in the religious mortification of the rankneſſe of the fleſhly nature of man; to make his bodie, which is the temple of the holy Ghoſt, more ſeaſonable for that diuine Spirit, & more comfortable for his owne regenerate ſoule to dwell in. This being the principall end, is alſo the forme, and (as we may ſo ſay) the verie ſoule of euerie religious faſt: by which the true nature of faſting muſt be diſcerned from falſe and ſuperſtitious. Now the imputation of indiſcretion in the Romiſh faſts, ariſeth from the conſideration of the time, manner, perſons, and immediate end of their faſts.

                     it is properly a fast (if the nature can endure it,) to eate and drinke nothing at all, during the preſcribed time of faſt. This is the firſt deformitie, viz. to ſeeme properly to faſt eating.
                  12 Secondly, in the matter and meaſure of their faſt, the practiſe of their church is maruellouſly exorbitāt, preſcribing (for ſo they cal it) Quartum fuit magis delicatum ieiunium, conſtans ex oleribus, & leguminibus, & pomis:—quintum fuit veſci pultibus, & abſtinere à carnibus, ouis, lacte, & quicquid lacte fit, & à vino: quod ad hunc vſque diem ſeruatur, praeſertim in Quadrageſima, praeterquàm quòd vinum bibitur.

Tolet. Ieſ. Inſtruct. Sacerd. lib. 6. cap. 3. §. Primo. 
                     both fleſh and white-meates are forbidden, where notwithstanding there is no faſt; as though they would teach men not to faſt faſting. Againe, they thus dieting their faſters with fruits, roots, and many delicacies, would, no doubt, be ſtill thought zealous affecters of prime antiquity; albeit they muſt, and do confeſſe, that Mihi purio

                  13 Yet is not this all, for in their faſts they forbid Eccleſia Romana abſtinentiam praecipit carnium, ouorum, caſei, non autem in frigidioribus regionibus à vino. Bellarm. lib. 2. de bonis operibus, cap. 5. In more poſitum eſt, vt in diebus

                     children, and women that ſucke, & women great with child, beſides beggers and weake perſons; yet to licence alſo all youth vnder the age of one and twenty yeares, all workmen who are greatly laborious, all who by office are employed in the ouerſight of any publike bodily worke, all Preachers and Readers, and ſome kind of husbands to eate in the time of their publike religious faſts, is, we thinke, an indulgence void of any ancient preſcription.
                  15 Fourthly, one Eccleſia ieiunium inſtituit quod eſt poenale. Tolet. Ieſ. Inſtruct. Sacerd. de fine ieiunij.
                      
                     end of their faſting is, that it ſhould be in his degree (as their Ieſuite ſaith) penall, ſeruing for a puniſhment. How it may be called penall or correctiue, we will not contend. The faſt of our Sauiour, who 
                        Matth. 42. 
                     faſted and was hungrie, doth teach vs that hunger, wherein there is a kind of affliction, is indeed the outward perfection of a religious faſt, which except it bite of this ſalt, cannot be altogether ſo ſeaſonable. This our Aduerſaries muſt likewiſe confeſſe, if they will call the exerciſe of faſting truly penall.
                  
                  
                     
16 Well then, let vs compare their preſcribed faſts with this end: we haue heard of their faſting with breakfaſt, and of the nature of their delicate fasts, where they are allowed to eate all varietie of rootes, fruits, fiſhes, and whatſoeuer iunkets which haue not any affinitie with fleſh: they are licenced to drinke wines without exception, yet ſo, that they eate & drinke (which is the dutie of euery Chriſtian, euen in banqueting) without intemperate exceſſe. Thus whileſt that our aduerſaries do define faſts to be penall, and preſcribe or allow ſuch as are ſo pleaſantly delicate, their manner of faſting is not void of, at leaſt, a little leauē of hypocriſy, which the mouth of almoſt a

                     wicked opinion of ſome Magiſtrates, who forbid all ſale of fleſh in the time of Lent, cauſing therby, as much as lay in them, either the death or diſeaſes of many languiſhing people, by a too ſuperſtitious reſtraint.
                  
                  18 This defect (we confeſſe) proceeded rather from the ignorance of ſuch Magiſtrates, then from the imperfection of their law of faſting; which we would not haue noted, but onely becauſe herein there is ſome apparence of an iniquitie; to wit, publike Magiſtrates can tranſgreſſe the law of God in more then endangering the liues of ſubiects, and are not cenſured by their Church: but if priuate men ſhall be knowne to haue tranſgreſſed mans ordinance by eating fleſh ſecretly without cauſe of neceſſity, forthwith they are publikely and ſeuerely puniſhed. But we leaue this iniurie which is incident vnto the bodie.
                  19 As the ſoule is farre more precious, ſo the danger thereof is much more pernicious, which ſome men of ſcrupulous conſciences do two waies incurre: firſt they Nec probandi ſunt, qui mente huius legis non animaduerſâ, ad ſuperſtitioſam imò impiam proprij corporis debilitationem hoc Eccleſiae ſtatutum detorquent, dum nimiâ inediâ, vel noxio cibo morbos ſibi, nonnunquam mortemue accerſunt.—Non refe

                        t, inquit Hieronymus, vtrum magno vel paruo te interimas: quia de rapina holocauſtum offert, qui vel ciborum nimia egeſtate, vel manducandi, vel ſomni penuriá immoderatâ corpus affligit. Caſſander ibid. pag. 158. 
                     who being ignorāt of the law of faſting, do (as ſaith their Caſſander) by the ſtrict and ſuperstitious obſeruation of the outward letter therof, pine and conſume themſelues with faſting: notwithſtanding that (as S. Hierome teacheth) it is all one for a man to kill himſelfe with eating too little, as with too much, and ſuch a faſter may be ſaid to offer vnto God a Sacrifice of a thing ſtolne, who by too immoderate faſting doth ſhorten his owne life.
                  
                     
20 This is the danger of the ſoules of ſuch ſuperſtitious faſters, which falleth vpon them, though not by the intention of the law of their Church, yet peraduenture by want of due explication thereof, and by the rigorous exaction of ſome of their Cleargie men, againſt whom we find one publiſhing this complaint: Imprimis autem illorum hominum imperita ſuperſtitio, & ſuperſtitioſa imperitia damnanda eſt, & execranda, qui huius ſalubris conſtitutionis, ad hominum ſalutem (qui ſinis eſt legis) latae ſententiam & vim ignorantes, eam ad tyrannicam conſcientiarum oppreſſionem, & hominum exitium, & diuinae legis trangreſſionem conuerterunt, dum citrá diſcrimē quibuſuis intentata mortalis culpae poena, eius rigidam & exactam obſeruationem exegerunt, multoſque hac ſuperſtitione implicatos in ſumma incōmoda & pericula corporis & animae coniecerunt. Idem ibid. pag. 158. 
                     We abhorre (ſaith he) the ſuperstitious ignorance of ſome, who peruert the law made for mans good, vnto a tyrannie ouer the conſciences of men, and breach of the charitie commanded by the law of God, through the rigid and exact challenge of the obſeruation of the law of fast.
                  
                  21 Yet this danger may poſſibly be auoided by repentance at the houre of death, but the ſecond perill of the ſoule is more contagious, which is the opinion of a condigne meriting grace and glorie by the act of faſting, which (in whomſoeuer it is) muſt needs increaſe together with their faſt. We obiect not vnto our Aduerſaries the groſſeneſſe of the Montaniſts, who held Montanus, praeterquàm quòd priuata authoritate tres Quadrageſimas inſtituerit, in quibus non niſi aridis cibis veſcendum eſſe docuerit; noua ieiunia, & nouum ieiunandi modum inſtituit, abſtmens à cibis quibuſdam, velut à malo principio conditis.

                     faſting (as Cardinall Bellarmine in the name of his Church profeſſeth) is auailable to ſatisfie for ſinne, and to merit and deſerue an heauenly reward.

                  SECT. 7.
                  23 Becauſe our Aduerſaries are prone to obiect an Epicuriſme vnto Proteſtants, no otherwiſe then Vrbicus did vnto the Catholickes, (of whom S. Auguſtine ſaid, Ventricolas magnus ieiunator accuſat. Auguſt. epiſt. 86. Caſulano Presb. 
                     The worthy faſter accuſeth vs for bellygods,) as though Proteſtants contemned all manner of religious faſts: we cannot chooſe but take vp S. Auguſtines anſwer, and apply it vnto them, Nemo legem ſicut iſte, intelligit, ni

ſufficient to haue it publiſhed, eſpecially from his pen who is moſt traduced by our Aduerſaries in this argument.

                     There be two kinds of laudable Faſts (ſaith M. Luther,) the one ciuill, appointed by the Magiſtrate, which is to abſtaine from certaine meates at certaine times, for the better prouiding for the common-wealth, leſt the neceſſarie ſtore be conſumed with riot: the ſecond kind is ſpirituall, to be obſerued of all Chriſtians; and it were very good that this might be performed for certaine dayes before the feaſts of Eaſter, and Pentecost, and the Natiuitie of our Lord; alwayes with this caueat, that we put no opinion of merit in them. There is yet another faſt, which ought to be perpetuall among Chriſtians, which is vpon occaſions for the chaſtizing of the fleſh, that is, when the whole bodie is corrected in the fiue ſenſes abſtinence from ſuch things, wherein our outward man is naturally delighted. This kinde of fast (and he knew verie well) is not much vſed in Monaſteries. And againe, Omninò per ieiunium corporis caſtigatio &

                     A faſt is not to be vſed with a conceit of meriting thereby, but onely to the ſubduing of the fleſh, and better helping of our neighbour. And thus thou ſhalt truly ſerue thy God, when as thou ſhalt vndertake this freely for his honour, and to tame thy fleſh: but thoſe who eate fasting, do rather prouoke lust, then ſubdue it. What now remaineth, but by due compariſon to trie,
               
               
                  Whether the doctrine of Proteſtants or of Romaniſts be more ſafe in Chriſtian profeſsion, and practiſe of a religious Faſt.
                  SECT. 8.
                  25 Both kind of Profeſſors do require publicke and religious exerciſes of faſting, the end whereof ſhould be the taming of rebellious fleſh: but firſt they differ in the manner of exaction. The Romaniſts command the time of fortie dayes faſt, vpon a bond of §. 1. neceſſitie: the Proteſtants in the tenour of libertie, which libertie is not permitted vnto euery priuate man; for this would engender a confuſion: but is belonging vnto particular Churches of ſeuerall nations, accordingly as it was vſed in ancient times by the euidence of Eccleſiaſticall §. 1. & 2: ſtories.
                  26 Secondly, the Romaniſts free §. 5. 
                     all vnder twentie yeares of age, all Preachers, Readers, and whoſoeuer are employed in bodily labours; the Proteſtants charge all Chriſtians to faſt, ſo farre as the indifferent abilitie of nature ſhall permit.
                  27 Thirdly, the Romaniſts account it a faſt, by the Decree of their Pope Teleſphorus Pontifex in ſuo Decreto quod habetur Diſt. 4. Cap. Statuimus. Statuimus vt ſeptem hebdomadas plenas Clerici in ſortem Domini vocati,

Teleſphorus, which is onely an abſtinence from fleſh: but Proteſtants define a true faſt, to be an abſtinence (in them that are able) from all nutriments; which hath bene §. 5. confeſſed to be more agreeable vnto antiquitie.
                  
                  
                     
28 Fourthly, the Romaniſts preſcribe faſts as religious corrections, and penall exerciſes, and do notwithſtanding pamper their people with varietie of §. 5. 
                     delicates: but Proteſtants vrge an abſtinence from all naturall delights; which croſſeth that conceit, where with ſome men haue bene poſſeſſed, and were anciently condemned by S. Famam abſtinentiae quaerunt in delicijs. Hieron. ad Nepotian.
                      Hierome; who ſought a fame of fasting in the vſe of delicates. How much greater hypocriſie may that ſeeme to hatch, which hath profeſſed Penance in their pleaſant repaſts?
                  29 Fiftly, the now Romaniſts aſcribe vnto the obſeruations of their faſts power of §. 6. 
                     merit and ſatisfaction: but Proteſtants teach men in actions of humiliation to put vpon them the ſpirit of humilitie, and not to truſt vnto the merit of their Fasts: and ſome of our Aduerſaries haue confeſſed, that §. 5. & 6. 
                     the putting of confidence in ſuch obſeruations hath bene the ſnare of mens conſciences, and darkning of the truth of the Goſpell.

                     filled their bellies with peaſon, and ſwelled in their minds with pride, ſaith, that it is more ſafe to take food moderately for our refreſhing, then to be crammed with pulſe, eſpecially remembring how Eſau was not reprehended for eating fleſh, but for lentels, nor Adam condemned for fleſh, but for the fruit of the tree, nor Ionathan endangered for fleſh, but for the taſt of hony.
                  
                  31 And if againe we rightly diſcerne the leproſie of Maſſe 
                        See confuted aboue, cap. 11. merit, then may we alſo be perſwaded that our godly & reuerend Arch-biſhop (here obiected by our 
                        Apolog. pag. 19. num. 9. Apologiſts) had ſome cauſe thus to reſolue: 
                        B. Whitgift in his defence, pag. 102. the place obiected by the Apolog.
                      
                     I thinke (ſaith he) that in S. Auſtens time a man might haue obſerued this rule of faſting without offence vnto God, but I do not thinke that he may do ſo now in like manner; becauſe it is certaine that in the Church of Rome there are many wicked opinions, both of the difference of meats, and alſo of merits adioyned vnto them: ſo that if it were a ſin not to fast as S. Ambroſe and thoſe Fathers did, it is more ſinne to faſt as the Papiſts do.
                  
                  32 Be thou notwithſtanding (good Reader) mindfull of that ſaying of God by the Angell vnto Sara, when her ſeruant Hagar was brought backe vnto her,

                     Behold (ſaith he) ſhe is in thy hands, do with her what thou willeſt: ſo if thou be endued with the ſpirit of God, thou haſt thy bodie cōmitted vnto thy diſcretion to chaſtiſe by priuate faſting, & to humble it vnto thy Chriſtian ſeruice, & by publike according vnto the godly diſcretion of that Church wherein thou liueſt; alwaies remembring the leſſon of Ieiunârunt Niniuitae, & iram effugerunt; ieiunârunt Iudaei, & nihil profecerunt.—Iram iſtam non ſoluebat ieiunium aut ſaccus, ſed vitae immutatio.

                  THE PROTESTANTS APPEALE: Shewing the State of the queſtion as it is vnfolded by our learned Aduerſaries.
                  
                  SECT. 1.
                  
                     THis Argument of Tradition which our Aduerſaries make to be, as it were, the Metropolis of all their preſumptions, will appeare to be but an aiery meteore,, after that the ſtate of this controuerſie ſhall be throughly laid open, and other particulars diſcuſſed, which are incident thereunto. The importance hereof may craue an extraordinary patience of our godly Reader in peruſing our anſwer, & diligence in examining our proofes; for now we contend for the full ſufficiencie and perfection of the Oracles of all truth, and the foundation of Chriſtian faith, which is the written word of God: thus then
                  2 Controuerſia inter nos & Proteſtantes, in duobus conſiſtit; primum eſt quòd nos afferimus in Scripturis nō cōtineri expreſſè totam doctrinam, ſiue de fide, ſiue de moribus, & proinde, praeter verbum Dei ſcriptum, diuinas & Apoſtolicas Traditiones eſſe neceſſarias. Lutherus huic doctrinae dicit Anathema. Omnes volunt omnia ad ſalutem neceſſaria, in ipſis Scripturis contineri. Secundò diſſidemus, quòd illi exiſtimant Apoſtolos quaedam inſtituiſſe praeter Scripturas, quae ad ritus & ordinem Eccleſiae pertinent, quae tamen non ſunt neceſſaria, nec praecepta, ſed libera.

                     The difference betweene Proteſtants and vs (ſay the Romaniſts) concerning Tradition, conſiſteth in two things; we hold that all doctrine neceſſarily belonging vnto faith and manners of life, is not expreſly (Non ob eum finem Scripturae datae ſunt, vt eſſent totius fidei regula ſufficientiſſima, vel vt omnem veritatem complecterentur ant expreſſam aut ex proprijs principijs deducendam: Proteſtantes contrà. Stapleton. doctrin. princip. lib. 12. cap 3. Eccleſia Catholica in ijs quae ſunt ſidei non eſt alligata ad Scripturas tantùm. Ibid. cap. 4. 
                     or by way of neceſſary conſequent) contained in Scripture, but affirme, that beſides the written word of God, other diuine and Apoſtolicall vnwritten Traditions be neceſſarie. But all Proteſtants hold, that all things neceſſarie to ſaluation are contained in the written word: 
                     Deſenſio Proteſtantium in Colloquio Ratisbonenſi fuit, hoc argumentum locum habere contra eos tantùm, qui Scripturae authoritatē non recipiunt, non autem contra eos (ſuch as are all Proteſsants) apud quos praeſuppoſita eſt Scripturae ſacrae authoritas. Tannerus Ieſ. aduerſus Relat. Hunni. cap. 12. 
                     yet ſo, that the queſtion haue place amongſt them, who beleeue the authority of Scriptures. 
                     Bellarmine in the place before alledged. 
                     Our ſecond difference is, that they thinke indeed that the Apoſtles ordained rites and ceremonies, which are not written in Scriptures, but ſuch (ſay they) as were for decency only, and left vnto the liberty of the Church to be vſed, or changed.
                  
                  2 This we confeſſe to be a full and true relation, diſtinguiſhing aright of the articles of this controuerſie, which theſe Apologiſts, and other our Aduerſaries, in obiecting teſtimonies of Fathers againſt the Proteſtants doctrine, haue either ſubtilly or ignorantly 
                        For though in the beginning of this Section they diſtinguiſh in word Traditions and Ceremonies, yet in their allegations they do ſo confound them, that their Reader cannot diſcerne when the Fathers ſpeake for Tradition or for ceremonies: and ſo may he more eaſily be miſlead to think
                              •
                            that all Fathers writ for the Tradition of doctrines againſt the ſufficiencie of Scripture.
                      confounded. For our more

readie and ſafe paſſage through this great Ocean, we make this our firſt examen:
               
               
                  Whether Protestants do confeſſe themſelues, in this question (concerning the ſufficiency of Scripture,) destitute of the generall patronage of ancient Fathers.

                  7 The moſt religious Emperour Constantine may not be thought to haue bene heretically affected, when he admoniſhed the Fathers and reuerend Biſhops of the firſt Councell of Nice, in all their queſtions Conſtantinus Magnus Imperator: Euāgelici & Apoſtolici libri, & antiquorum Prophetarum oracula planè nos inſtruunt quid de diuinis ſentiendum eſt: proinde hoſtili poſita diſcordia, ex verbis diuinitus inſpiratis ſumamus quaeſtionum explicationes.

Bellar. lib. 4. de verbo Dei, cap. 11. 
                     Conſtantine was indeed a great Emperour (ſaith he,) but no great Doctor, Which anſwer, if not rather ſcorne, doth not onely touch Conſtantine, 
                     Euſebius quidem dixit, Conſtantinum quaſi communem quendam Epiſcopum diuinitus conſtitutum, quae ad pacem Dei faciunt, vniuerſis diſpenſantem. Eſpencans Epiſcopus comment. in 1.

Neither is that anſwer which Bellarmine addeth, that by diuina, are meant ea quae ad diuinam naturam pertinent: but, as Caſſidiore tranſlateth, de veritate & lege diuina. And Theodoret. lib. 1. cap. 7. in the words going before, ſaith,

                        Concerning vnwritten Traditions and Ceremonies, it is confeſſed as followeth, Whereas

                        S. Chryſoſtome ſaith, (3) The Apoſtles did not deliuer all things by writing, but many things without, and theſe be as worthie of credit as the other: M. Whittaker in anſwer thereof, 
                        Whittaker de ſacra Scriptura, pag. 678. paulò poſt med. I anſwer that this is an inconſiderate ſpeech, and vnworthy ſo great a Father: & whereas Epiphanius ſaith, 
                        Epiphā. haer. 61. circa med. We muſt vſe Tradition, for the Scripture hath not all things, and therefore the Apoſtles deliuered certaine things by writing, and certaine by Tradition: with whom agreeth S. Baſil ſaying, 
                        Baſil. de Spir. ſanct. cap. 27. Some thing we haue from Scripture, other things from the Apoſtles Tradition &c. both which

hath like force vnto Chriſtian Religion: M. D. Reynolds anſwering to theſe foreſaid ſayings of Baſill and Chryſoſtome, ſaith,

Euang. cap. 8. is obiected to ſay that the Apoſtles publiſhed their doctrine, partly by writing, partly without writing, as it were by a certaine vnwritten law. M. Whittaker de ſacra Scriptura, pag. 668. fine, ſaith thereto, I anſwer that this teſtimonie is plaine enough, but in no ſort to be receiued, becauſe it is againſt the Scriptures.

                  SECT. 4.
                  9 Here are not many teſtimonies of Fathers expreſly vrged, whereby our cauſe may ſeeme to receiue any preiudice in the doctrine of vnwritten Traditions. The firſt is the teſtimonie of S. Chryſostome, wherein if by theſe words, [as worthy of credit] be meant the Traditions ceremonial, in this ſence we muſt beleeue certainly that the ceremonies ordained by the Apoſtles were iuſt, and lawfull, albeit (as euen our Aduerſaries See a little hereafter. do teach) alterable: ſo this ſentence doth not differ from the profeſſion of Proteſtants. But if the Romaniſts will haue it vnderſtood of doctrinall points of faith, which are abſolutely neceſſarie vnto ſaluation, as though ſome ſuch article were not recorded in Scriptures; then was it not vniuſtly to be cenſured a ſpeech vnfitting the golden mouth of Chryſoſtome: becauſe ſo S. Chryſoſtome ſhould contradict himſelfe in many places, not onely of his ſuppoſed works (as hath bene 
                        See aboue §. 3. lit. e. ſhewed) in ſo plaine ſort iuſtifying our defence of onely Scripture, that their Church hath therefore in their new editions of Chryſoſtome wiped that ſentence out: but alſo in his vnqueſtionable works, yea euen in his Homily next going before the obiected teſtimonie, where exhorting all men to be exerciſed in reading the Scriptures, Omnia clara ſunt & plana ex Scripturi
                           •

                     All things (ſaith he) which are neceſſary, are manifeſt; and yet againe more plainly, Non oportet quicquam dicere ſine his teſtibus

                        . So M. Whitaker de ſacra Scriptura, quaeſt. 6. To Chryſoſtome we haue anſwered before.
                      Authors, (whom theſe obiectors do alledge,) fully ſatisfied, who haue proued, firſt, that diuerſe Traditions which Epiphanius fancied, were confuted by ancient Fathers: S. Hierome croſſing him in his Tradition concerning the place of Chriſts birth, and of Adams ſepulcher: Cyprian, in his Tradition of the breach of a vow: Auguſtine, in his Tradition of the times of faſts.
                  
                  11 Secondly, our Aduerſaries may not abſolutely exact his iudgement herein, except (according to the Traditions by him ſpecified) they will be bound neuer to cut their beards: and likewiſe recant their now Romiſh doctrine, which teacheth (contrarie vnto Epiphanius) that 
                        See aboue lib. 1. cap. 2. §. 35. 
                     it is better to wallow in daily fornication, then after a vow to be coupled in wedlocke.
                  
                  12 Laſtly, we are in this queſtion thus directed by Epiphanius himſelfe: Nos vniuſcuiuſque quaeſtionis inuentionem non ex proprijs ratiocinationibus, ſed ex Scripturarum conſequentia diſcere poſſumus. Epiphan. haereſ. 61. but more fully haereſ. 69. 
                     In inuention of truth we are in euery queſtion to learne what to hold, not from our owne reaſons, but from the conſequences of Scripture.

                      Doctor, prouing from the iudgement of Eraſmus, that the obiected booke cannot be neceſſarily fathered vpon S. Baſil: ſecondly, by way of Dilemma; for if the Traditions, which Baſil accounteth

neceſſarie, be (notwithſtanding his authority) not neceſſarie, why are they obiected? But if by his authoritie they muſt be iudged neceſſarie, how ſhall S. Hierome be excuſed, who reiected the Tradition approued by Baſil concerning the perſon of Zacharie, mentioned, Matth. 23? Or what ſhal be anſwered for Eucherius & Socrates, who confute the neceſſity of praying towards the East? or Chryſoſtome, who (contrarie vnto Baſils neceſſitie of bleſſing the water) teacheth, that all waters are by Christ his baptiſme ſanctified for baptiſme? or how ſhall any pleade for Cyprian, Gregory, & the Councell of Toletum, who altered and condemned Baſils neceſſitie of threefold dipping of the baptized into the water? Or laſtly, wherewith may the Romaniſts iuſtifie themſelues, who vſually pray kneeling, contrarie vnto Baſils neceſſitie of ſtanding in prayer, all the time betweene Eaſter and Pentecoſt?
                  
                  14 Thus (we ſee) our Aduerſaries by exacting the authoritie of one, do condemne the iudgement of many, whereas (eſpecially ſeeing this booke cannot be proued to haue bene Baſils) they ſhould rather haue conſulted with other both many and plaine teſtimonies in his vndoubted works; where he iudgeth it Infidelitatis argumentum eſt, & ſignum ſuperbiae certiſſimum, ſi quis corū, quae ſcripta ſunt▪ aliquid velit reijcere; vel eorum, quae non ſunt ſcripta, introducere. Baſil. Serm. de fidei Confeſſ. Where although he confute priuate opinions, yet doth he vſe a generall principle, and therefore addeth in the ſame place, Apoſtolus per humanum exemplum vehementer prohibet aliquid diuinis Scripturis vel addere, vel demere, cùm dicit, Hominis teſtamentum nemo reprobat, aut aliquid ei ſuperſtruit; proinde quamcunque alienam à Domini doctrina vocem ac mentem, ita nos ſemper & nunc fugiendam cog nouimus. There, indeed, he vſeth new words, but ſuch as contained no new doctrine, for he ſaith, Non ſunt alienae à ſenſu Scripturae. 
                     an argument of infidelitie, and an euident ſigne of pride in any, who ſhall reiect either any doctrine that is written, or bring in any which is not written. Likewiſe in another Tract (which is by our Aduerſaries attributed vnto him) he holdeth it Neceſſarium eſt & conſonum, vt ex ſacra quis Scriptura quod neceſſe ſit diſeat, ad pietatis plerophoriam, tum ne humanis Traditionibus aſſueſcat. Baſil. Reg. contract. q. 95. Si quicquid non eſt ex fide, peccatum eſt, vt vult Apoſtolus, Fides verò ex auditu, auditus autem per verbum Deitergo quicquid extra Scripturam diuinam eſt, cùm ex fide non ſit, peccatum eſt. Baſil. Ethic. Reg. 80. c. 22. 
                     neceſſarie, that euery one learne out of Scripture, what is neceſſarily to be learned, both for his full perſwaſion in points of godlineſſe, and alſo leſt he be caried away by humane Traditions.

Euſebius. haue fully related: where (to paſſe ouer other Ait Euſebius, Chriſtum non omnia omnibus tradidiſſe, ſed excellentiora quaedam perfectis hominibus reſeruâſſe; atque ſic etiam feciſſe Apoſtolos: longè aliter Irenaeus lib 3. cap. 15. Deindè abſurdum eſt exiſtimare, tam excellentes ac ſublimes eſſe illas Traditiones, quas Papiſtae venditant, vt ſint omnibus communicandae. So M Whittaker de ſacra Scriptura, q. 6. cap. 12. anſwers) if by Tradition vnwritten, he meant matters not neceſſarily belonging vnto faith, it doth not weaken our cauſe, which defendeth only that See confeſſed aboue in the ſtate of the queſtion, Cardinall Bellarmine. 
                     doctrines neceſſary to be beleeued are writtē in Scripture: but if they will vnderſtand thereby doctrines which are neceſſarie for euerie man to beleeue, then the clauſe of Euſebius, where he ſaith, that the people were taught partly by written Traditions, partly by vnwritten; cannot agree with the conſent of our Aduerſaries, affirming that all things abſolutely neceſſary for all mens ſaluation, are written in Scripture: and thus muſt the Romaniſts either grant, that the teſtimony of Euſebius maketh not againſt Proteſtants, or elſe confeſſe, it maketh againſt themſelues. And we cannot be perſwaded that Euſebius, who writ a booke in commendation of 
                        See aboue Sect. 3. num. 7. Conſtantine, could diſſent from his confeſſed reſolution ſo greatly approued in the Councell of Nice, whom our Aduerſaries haue reiected. We returne vnto

                        Auguſt de Bapt. contra Donat. lib. 5. cap. 23. The Apoſtles commaunded nothing hereof, but that cuſtome which was oppoſed herein againſt Cyprian, is to be beleeued to proceed from their Tradition, as many things be, which the whole Church holdeth, and are therfore well beleeued to be commaunded of the Apoſtles, although they be not written. Wherein and 
                        See the like ſaying in Auſtin epiſt. 118. ad Ianuarium. 
                        other his like ſayings, his meaning is ſo evident and confeſſed, that M. Cartwright ſpeaking thereof▪ ſaith, 
                        See M. Cartwright in M. Whitgifts defence, &c. pag. 103. ante medium. To allow S. Auſtens ſaying, is to bring in Poperie againe: and that 
                        See M. Cartwrights words alledged vbi ſuprà. if S. Auſtens iudgement be a good iudgement, then there be ſome things commaunded of God, which are not in the Scriptures, and thereupon no ſufficient doctrine contained in the Scriptures.
                  
               
               
                  THE PROTESTANTS APPEALE.
                  SECT. 5.
                  16 We ſee no reaſon why we may not ſo farre admit S. Augustine, in this queſtion, among the Latine Fathers, (ſeeing our Aduerſaries ſo pleaſe) that he alone may ſerue for all. The matter in controuerſie is, indeed, a doctrinall queſtion, to wit, whether thoſe, who haue bene baptized by hereticks, ought to be rebaptized. S. Cyprian held that they ought, alledging, that except the contrary Vnde eſt haec Traditio? an ex Dominica authoritate deſcendens, an de Apoſtolorum mandatis & epiſtolis? ea enim facienda eſſe, quae ſcripta ſunt, teſtatur Dominus. Cypr. epiſt. 10. ad Pomp.
                      
                     Tradition may be proued out of Scripture, it deſerueth no credit. S. Auguſtine, although he maintaine the contrary concluſiō vnto Cyprian, ſaying, that they which haue bene baptized once, may not be baptized againe; yet doth he hold S. Cyprians caution, viz. the neceſſity of prouing this doctrine by Scripture: iudging this (which our Aduerſaries call an 
                        See before, pag. 343. 
                     erroneous exception) to be indeed Quod Cyprianus monet, &c. See aboue, pag. 343. 
                     the beſt courſe; which he himſelfe preſently followeth, confirming his queſtion of not rebaptizing by Scripture, as Epheſ. 4. and euincing the ſame truth (to vſe his owne words) by Ne videar humanis argumentis agere, ex Euangelio profero certa documenta. Auguſt. contra Donat. lib. 1. cap. 7. tom. 7.

Ibid. lib. 6. cap. 1. See alſo de Gen ad lit. lib. 10. cap. 23. The inſtance which Bellarm. giueth, is confuted.
                      
                     which we haue ſhewed (ſaith he) by Scriptures. So plainly make theſe for the perfection of Scripture, that our Aduerſarie Cardinall Bellarmine without an Si hae, Auguſtini, coniecturae non valent niſi poſt Concilij definitionem, vt vult Bellarminus, cùm non valebant quando ijs Auguſtinus pugnabat contra Donatiſtas, adhuc enim nihil de hac re erat contra Donatiſtas in Conc▪ aliquo definitum. So Whitaker de ſacra Script. q. 6. pag. 457. which fully ouerthroweth the anſwer which Bellar. vſed, Auguſtinum vſum fuiſſe coniecturis ex Scriptura, quae aliquid valent ad confirmandam veritatem poſt Concilij definitionem, ſed per ſe non ſufficiunt. Ibid.
                      errour cannot tell how to ſhift them.
                  17 In the ſecond like ſaying (as they call it) of S. Auguſtine, which we haue related from their 
                        Obiect. Auguſt. epiſt. 118. Illa quae non ſcripta ſed tradita cuſtodimus, quae quidem toto terrarum orbe ſeruanturr, dantur intelligi vel ab ipſis Apoſtolis, vel plenarijs Concilijs, quorum eſt in Eccleſia ſaluberrima authoritas commendata, atque ſtatuta retineri: ſicut quòd Domini paſſio, & reſurrectio, & aſcenſio in coelum, & aduentus de coelo Spiritus ſancti anniuerſaria ſolennitate celebratur. Vt refert Bellar. lib. 4. de verbo non ſcripto, cap. 7. §. Sed Auguſtinus. Cardinall, the obiectors might haue bene ſatiſfied

by our learned Author whom they haue produced: 
                        Anſwer: Hae traditiones non ita ſunt magni momenti: nam ſine his omnia poſſunt eſſe in religione ſalua. Secundò Auguſtinus neſcit num iſtorum dierum obſertiatio ab Apoſtolis an à plenarijs Concilijs inſtituta fuerit▪ vocat quidem has neceſſarias, ſed quomodo ad ſalutē? nullo modo, ſed quòd neceſſe eſſe cuiuis illas ſeruare, quocunque ſe conferret ad ſeruandam 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        , & ſcandala remouenda. Poſtremò Socrates lib. 5. cap. 22. Sozom. lib. 7. cap. 19. Auguſt. epiſt. 86. ſcribunt nihil omninò de feſtis diebus praeſcripfiſſe, aut Chriſtum, aut Apoſtolos. M. Whittaker de ſacra Scriptura, quaeſt. 6. cap. 12. who ſheweth that theſe are queſtions of ceremonies, and not of doctrines of faith: things which are neceſſarie to be be kept in their times and places for feare of ſcandall, but not of neceſſitie vnto ſaluation. Neither yet hath S. Auguſtine defined, that theſe Festiuals are by Apoſtolicall Tradition: but elſewhere (according to the light of Eccleſiaſticall hiſtory) he confeſſeth, that neither Chriſt nor his Apoſtles preſcribed any certaine times of faſting.
                  
                  18 The conſequent which they vrge out of T. C. is not altogether ſo concluſiue, for they might well conceiue, that albeit we can be contented that S. Auguſtine may ſerue for all Latine Fathers; yet are we not bound to admit that M. Cartwright ſhall ſerue for all Expoſitors of S. Auguſtine, eſpecially knowing that he hath bene ſo learnedly confuted by our reuerend Biſhop in replie vnto that obiection, ſaying, that this ſentence of Auguſtine (euen in that ſence propounded) is the ouerthrow of Popery: becauſe this Romiſh Article can neuer be proued by due concurrance of antiquitie. But concerning M. Cartwrights inference, we haue more occaſion to anſwer See hereafter. hereafter: we returne vnto S. Auguſtine, in whom we further inſiſt, and proue,
               
               
                  
                     That S. Auguſtine in this queſtion of Tradition, is an excellent Patron of the Proteſtants Aſſertion: in defending the ſufficiencie of Scripture.
                  
                  SECT. 6.
                  19 To know how little cauſe our Aduerſaries haue to ſingle out S. Auguſtine to ſerue for all, we ſhal need no better witneſſe then S. Auguſtine himſelfe: Vltimò proferunt Auguſtini teſtimonia, ac primum lib. 2 de doctr. Chriſt. cap. 9. In his, quae apertè poſita ſunt in Scriptura, inueniuntur illa omnia, quae continent fidem moréſque viuendi. Etiam in lib. de bono viduit. cap. 1. Sancta enim Scriptura noſtrae doctrinae regulam figit, ne audeamus ſapere plus quàm oportet. Non eſt ergo mihi aliud te docere, quàm verba tibi Doctoris exponere. Etiam lib. 2 de peccat. merit. & remiſſ. cap. 36. Vbi de re obſeu

Bellarm. lib. 4. de verbo Dei, cap. 11. §. Vltimò proferunt. Reſpondeo ad primum; loquitur de doguiatibus, quae neceſſaria ſunt omnibus ſimpliciter, qualia ſunt quae in Symbolo Apoſtolico, & Decalogo continentur.

Ad tertium; loquitur de quaeſtionibus obſeuriſſimis, qualē eſſe putabat de origine animarum, ad quas definiend as non ſuppetunt vlla firma teſtimonia, ſed ſolùm coniecturae quaedam ex diuinis literis. Bellar. ibid.
                      
                     Amongst thoſe things (ſaith he) which are contained in Scripture, all thoſe things may be found, which concerne faith, and manners of life. But why? Holy Scripture (ſaith he) is vnto vs the rule of doctrine, leſt we ſhould be wiſe aboue that we ought. What then? Whenſoeuer there is question made (ſaith he) of a caſe of greateſt difficulty, and we haue not cleare proofes of Scripture for our concluſion, ſo long muſt mans preſumption keepe ſilence.
                  
                  20 Theſe proofes are both verie perſpicuous and pertinent, wherunto our Aduerſaries cannot make any anſwer, but with their greater 
                        For the firſt teſtimony, lib. 2. de doctr. Chriſt. cap. 9. In omnibus his libris timentes Deū, & pietate menſueti, quaerunt voluntatē Dei. Then followeth. In ijs enim, &c. plainly ſhewing that of thoſe doctrines which did concerne not onely generally all men. but alſo euery one, euen Biſhops themſelues in all things neceſſary. Secondly, by Card. Bellarmines grant we may conclude, that no vnwritten tradition is ſimply neceſſary for all men. Thirdly, if by the iudgement of S. Auguſtine, Scripture be ſufficient for direction in the moſt obſcure queſtions, ſuch as is the originall production of the ſoule, then certes much more ſufficient muſt they be thought to be in queſtions of more neceſſarie conſequence.
                      entanglements.

We therefore conclude out of the ſame Father, that Deum contra inſidioſos errores voluiſſe ponere fundamentum in Scripturis. Auguſt. 2. tract. in Ioh. Sancta Scriptura noſtrae doctrinae regulam figit, ne audeamus plus ſapere quàm oporte
                           •
                        ; ſed ſapiamus ad temperantiam, ſicut vnicuique Deus partitus eſt menſuram fidei. Auguſt. lib. de bono viduit. cap. 1. the words are generall for the proofe of one particular.
                      
                     God hath ſet in Scriptures a foundation againſt the ſeducement of errour, & a rule of godlineſſe, that we may be wiſe vnto ſobriety.
                  
                  21 Theſe be infallible teſtimonies of the ſufficiency of holy Writ. What now remaineth, but that we heare S. Auguſtine pronounce an Proinde ſiue de Chriſto, ſiue de Eccleſia, ſiue de quacunque alia re, quae pertinet ad fidem vitamue noſtram, non dicam ſi nos, nequaquaquam comparandi ei qui dixit, [Licet ſi nos] ſed quod ſecutus adiecit, Si Angelus de coelo vobis annunciauerit praeterquàm quod in Scripturis legalibus & Euangelicis accepiſtis, Anathema ſit. Auguſt. contra lit. Petil. lib. 3. cap. 6. Legite haec nobis de Lege, de Prophetis, de Pſalmis, de ipſo Euangelio, de literis Apoſtolicis, & credemus. Auguſt. de vnitate Eccleſ. cap. 6.

Auguſt. lib. 2. de baptiſ. cap. 6. 
                     Anathema vpon all them who ſhall teach any thing either of Chriſt or his Church, or any other matter of faith, beſides that which is receiued from Legall and Euangelicall Scriptures? whereunto we wiſh our Aduerſaries would ſubſcribe? But they proceed.

But to the purpoſe.
                  23 They begin with Clemens Alexandrinus, belike not without cauſe; for their Cardinall herein would ſeeme in a manner victorious, ſaying:

Here indeed, our Aduerſaries haue much matter for their Traditions, but it is of that kind as muſt (if they will needs defend it) proue them no Catholikes: becauſe Tertullian then a Montaniſt, defended 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , a preſcription of ſet faſts by a law of neceſſitie, and an abſtinence from certaine kind of meates with an opiniō of ſanctity, eagerly inueighing againſt the Catholike Church for denying the maner of their faſts by drie meats: and for calling ſuch kind of rites a noueltie: not to mention his condemning of ſecond mariages: he himſelfe being for ſuch errours condemned by S. Hierome and other Fathers, as an Aduerſary vnto the Catholike Church. And his Traditions in the place alledged, are threefold merſion, giuing hony and milke vnto perſons baptized, receiuing the Euchariſt at the time of meate: which our Aduerſaries themſelues haue in their wiſdome reiected.
                  25 Might it not haue become the Apologiſts (if they had bene ſtudious of truth) to haue left Tertullian, where Tertullian left the true Church? but peraduenture they did foreſee, that if they ſhould be vrged to conſult not with the Montaniſt, but with the Catholike Tertullian, their hold of Tradition would ſuffer a breach. For Tertullian in his booke of Preſcription written againſt heretikes, doth (as Doctor See the teſtimonie going before. Whitaker hath proued,) wound their

cauſe; and elſewhere he diſputeth againſt the heretike Hermogenes negatiuely from Scripture, thus: Profert. 11. Tertull. qui lib. contra Hermog. Adoro, inquit, Scripturae plenitudinem. Scriptum eſſe doceat Hermogenis officina. Si non eſt ſcriptū, timeat vae illud adijcientibus, vel detrahentibus deſtinatum. Reſpondeo, loquitur Tertull. de vno dogmate tantùm, quòd ſcilicet Deus creauerit omnia ex nihilo, non ex praeiacente materia, vt Hermogenes ſomniabat. Etquoniam hoc dogma apertiſſimè continetur in Scripturis, dicit Tertullianusſe adorare Scripturae plenitudinem, quantum ad hoc dogma; & addit, Hermogenem qui addebat ad Scripturam dogma contrarium, & repugnaus ipſi Scripturae, incidere in ipſam male dictionem, qua prohibemur nihil addere, aut detrahere Scripturae, ita vt veritas eius immutetur. Bellar. lib. 4 de verbo Dei non ſcripto, cap. 11. pag. 182. Anſwer: Verba Tertulliani generalia ſunt: diſputat enim Tertull. negatiuè ab authoritate Scripturarum, ſic: Hermogenes non poteſt docere hoc eſſe ſcriptum, Ergo vae, &c.

                     This thy doctrine is not written, therefore is there due vnto it a woe, which is denounced againſt them, who adde vnto Scripture: wherein he is ſo confident as to profeſſe, that heretikes cannot preuaile, if they ſhall be compelled to ſtand onely to Scriptures. From which againe he argueth negatiuely, thus; It is not proued (ſaith he) becauſe it is not written: then the which nothing can make more for the proofe of the ſufficiency and perfection of ſacred Writ.

                  27 The ſumme of all is this, that the Traditions which haue bene obiected, if they may be deduced out of Scripture, (ſuch as the Infantes poſſe baptizari deducitur euidenter ex Scripturis. Bellar. lib. 1. de Sacram. Baptiſ. cap. 9.

                     Apoſtles Creede are confeſſed to be:) then are they not properly to be reckoned amongſt their vnwritten Traditions: but if they be properly vnwritten, they may be conceiued as either contrary vnto Scriptures (ſuch as the teſtimonies of Clemens Alexandrinus, and Tertullian appeared to be,) and therefore cannot be equalled with Scriptures: or elſe were not held as neceſſarie, (as for example the times of

                  28 To conclude, we find not any Tradition abſolutely vnwritten (See in the Section following. whether doctrinall or ceremoniall,) deliuered by the Fathers, to be of that nature, as that it Sacroſancta Synodus—Accipimus omnes libros tam veteris quàm noui Teſtamenti, necnon Traditiones ipſas tum ad fidem tum ad mores pertinentes, tanquam vel ore tenus à Chriſto, vel à Spiritu ſancto dictatas, & continua ſucceſſione in Eccleſia Catholica conſeruatas, pari pietatis affectu & reuerentia ſuſ

                     ought to be embraced (this is the Romiſh profeſſion) with the like godly affection and reuerence, as we do the ſacred Scriptures. This we hold to be in Diuinitie more then a paradoxe, as both the aboue mentioned, and the now following examples do certainly demonſtrate.

                        See aboue §. 1. Aduerſarie) is contrarie to the common doctrine of Proteſtants: but if by ſimplicitie

And ſhall we thinke that thoſe purer times, when ſome ancients not content to keepe regiam viam, that is, the rode-way which is the written word of God, but were ſeduced by preſumption of vnwritten Traditions, and erred in points of docttine; could be altogether free from ſome ſprinklings and ſpots of ceremonious corruptions?
                  31 It is a 
                        See aboue Chap. 22. §. 1. knowne contention about the obſeruation of Eaſter, which afflicted and vexed the Church of God in the daies of Victor Biſhop of Rome, by diuiding the Eaſt and Weſt Churches, the one ſide pretending a Tradition from S. Iohn and S. Philip; the other preſuming of a ſuppoſed Tradition from S. Peter and S. Paul. Whereby was made a ſchiſme and rent not in the garment onely, but euen in the bodie of Chriſt, which is his Church.
                  32 Theſe two examples may ſerue for many, which might be alledged, to giue vs more then a ſignification of the danger and vncertaintie of vnwritten Traditions, which the aftertimes, euen of S. Auguſtine (not to wade deeper into this poole) had more cauſe to complaine of: whom we find bewailing the corruptions of his age, and confeſſing, that he Multa huiuſmodi propter nonnullarum, vel ſancta

34 In all theſe we heare of nothing but of altering, diſpenſing, abrogating, aboliſhing of Cuſtomes, Rites, Ceremonies, Canons (in their opinions) generall, ancient, and in moſt part neceſſarie and Apoſtolicall. If this be done (as they preſume) iuſtly, how ſhall they not excuſe, if not commend Proteſtants for the like abrogations, whom notwithſtanding they therefore ordinarily charge with intollerable contempt? Or how ſhall not our diſcreet Reader diſcerne which profeſſors do more ingenuouſly incline vnto the ſimplicitie of the Goſpell; whether the Romaniſts, who diſanull and abandon ſuch rites, although in their iudgement they ſeemed to haue bene Apoſtolicall; or Proteſtants, who iudging the moſt of theſe as not Apoſtolicall, do for the vncertaintie of ſuch like traditions, zealouſly affect eſpecially ſuch orders, which they are perſwaded did ſucceſſiuely and ſuccesfully deſcend from Antiquitie, admitting only of thoſe rites, which may neither oppreſſe the Church by their number, nor by their nature corrupt it?

                     What is this Tradition? from whence cometh it? from the authoritie of Chriſt in the Goſpell, or the precepts of the Apoſtles in their Epiſtles? and hath therefore bene reiected by our Aduerſaries, albeit he hath bene by S.

The which S. See ibid. Hilary approued in the Emperour Conſtantius, ſo farre forth as to account him an Anathema, and an Antichriſtian one, whoſoeuer ſhall gainſay it.

                  Whether profeſsion, of the Romanists or Protestants, be the more ſafe and ſecure for a Chriſtian mans reſolution: decided by the conſequences of our learned Aduerſaries.

                      ſtate of the queſtion may be remembred, viz. whether all they that acknowledge the truth of the Canon of Scriptures, ought not likewiſe to profeſſe this ſufficiency in them, to wit, that they containe in them all neceſſarie Canons and rules which may concerne all neceſſarie doctrines of faith, or directions of life. The Proteſtants haue affirmed it, the Romaniſts haue denied it: and theſe our Aduerſaries lay it downe for a fundamental concluſion, Tertium fundamentum: Multa pertinere ad Chriſtianorum doctrinam & fidem, quae nec apertè nec obſcurè in ſacris literis continentur.—Sanctorum Martyrum auxilium precibus eſſe implorandum, eorum ue memorias celebrandas, imagines venerandas eſſe,—ſacrae literae nuſquam fortè tradiderunt.

                     That there are many things belonging vnto the doctrine and faith of Chriſtianity, which are neither expreſly nor obſcurely contained in Scriptures. Which Traditions their Councell of Trent hath decreed to be worthily Sacroſancta Synodus,—Omnes libros tam veteris quàm noui Teſtamenti, cum vtriuſque Deus vnus ſit Author: nec non Traditiones ipſas tum ad fidem tum ad mores pertinentes, tanquam ore tenus, vel à Spiritu ſancto dictatas, & continui ſucceſſione in Eccleſia Catholica conſeruatas pari pietatis affectu & reuerentia ſuſcipit & veneratur.

                     honoured with equall affection and deuotion, as is due vnto the bookes of the old and new Teſtament. And whereas Proteſtants require ſuch a Catholike Councel which may be animated with the ſpirit of the written word, from whence only, and not from Traditions, all concluſions of neceſſary doctrine may be taken: our Aduerſaries iudge this Conditionem hanc Proteſtantes exigunt, vt in Concilijs ex ſola Scriptura diuina ſententiae ferantur, non ex Traditionibus.—Reſpondeo, eſt conditio iniqua. Bellar. lib. 1. de Conc. cap. 21. §. Quarta conditio. & §. Quartò,

                     Hereticks (ſay they) did refuſe Traditions, and appealed onely vnto Scriptures. Ergo Scriptures are not ſufficient rules of the doctrine of life. By this conſequence we may contrarily reioyne, viz. ſeeing that our learned Adurſaries, to wit Omnes Haeretici (inquit Auguſtin.) audacias figmentorum ſuorū, quas maximè exhorret ſenſus humanus, hac occaſione Euangelicae ſententiae colorare conantur, quaſi haec ipſa ſint, quae tunc Diſcipuli portare non poterant.

Weſton, do confeſſe almoſt of all the moſt notorious and peſtilent hereticks, (ſuch as were the Valentinians, Gnoſticks, Marcioniſts, Baſilidians, Encratites, Seucrians, Manichees, Arrians, Aërians, Carpocratians, Montanists, Archonticks, Donatiſts, Anabaptiſtes, &c. yea and of all Hereticks, that they refuſing to be tried onely by canonicall Scriptures, did ſhelter thēſelues vnder the pretext either of philoſophicall principles, or feined Goſpels, or forged Traditions (pretended to be Apoſtolicall) or fancied Reuelations. In which laſt point the Anabaptiſts are confeſſed not to haue bene inferiour, who (as their Doctor Weſton reporteth,) preſuming of their diuine Reuelations, neglected the Scriptures, accounting them a dead letter. We by the due oppoſition, which we are to hold againſt this Hydra of hereticks, all poſſeſſed with the ſame ſpirit of detracting from the ſufficiency of holy Scripture, may warrantably profeſſe our full reſolution of faith to depend of Gods Letters patents, the diuine Scriptures.
                  40 Thirdly, the manner of reaſoning negatiuely from Scripture: as thus, [that doctrine is not in Scripture, Ergo it is no neceſſarie doctrine of faith,] is (if it be true) ſo demonſtratiue an argument to eſtabliſh the truth of ſufficiency of Scripture, and to infringe the Romiſh faith of vnwritten traditions, that their

                     becauſe ſuch points cānot be proued from the written inſtitutions of Chriſt; & in confirming of the pretended prerogatiues of S.

                     it is not credible, ſeeing Purgatory is a doctrine of faith, but that it may be proued out of Scripture, doth yeeld vs our concluſion of defending nothing to be a neceſſary doctrine, which is not proued out of Scripture. Their Ieſuit 
                        See aboue §. 9. Suarez determineth, that the Prieſts eating of the Euchariſt is not the eſſential part of a Sacrifice, becauſe it is not directly euinced out of Scripture. Their Boniuentura ait, quia Euangeliſtae nullam mentionem huius inſtitutionis (ſpeaking of extreme vnction) faciunt, veriſimile eſſe Chriſtum illam non inſtituiſſe. Suarez Ieſ. diſp. 39. §. 2. Tom. 4. Boniuenture excepteth againſt Extreme vnction as not inſtituted by Chriſt, becauſe it is not mentioned in the Euangeliſts. Their Pope 
                        See aboue cap. 4. §. 5. Iulius renounceth the ſopping in of bread in the Eucharist, becauſe it is not in the Goſpell. All which do euince our manner of concluſion.
                  41 Laſtly, they pretend that the Traditions which they affirme to be written, are, Traditio non igitur dicitur non ſcripta doctrina, quòd nuſquam ſcripta eſt, ſed quòd non inuenitur ſcripta in vllo libro Apoſtolico, etiamſi ſcripta ſit in libris veterum patrum. Bellar. lib. 4. de verbo Dei, cap. 2. §. Vocatur.

Whereunto we may adde the experience of the vncertaintie of vnwritten Traditions, 
                        See aboue, §. 9. confeſſed by the examples of the Chiliaſts, vpon pretence of receiuing them from the Apoſtles; and of the Aſians in the contentious manner of obſeruation of See aboue. Eaſter, whileſt that the Weſt Church pleaded an originall of their cuſtome from S. Peter, the Eaſt Church theirs from S. Iohn. Ioyne vnto both theſe, the knowne peremptorineſſe of the Romiſh Church, which 
                        See aboue §. 10. hath altered or aboliſhed (either vpon ſuſpicion, that they were not true, or vpon ſuppoſition that they were not neceſſarie:) and all theſe muſt needs teach vs, that the vnwritten Traditions cannot deſerue equall honour with the written verities.

               THE ROMISH APOLOGIE.

                  Of Dionyſius mention is made Act. 17. 34 and of Hermes Rom. 16. 14.

                  THE PROTESTANTS APPEALE: Firſt prouing that the Author, whom they haue called the Apoſtolicke Dionyſius, is falſly ſo entituled, being indeed of a later, and obſcurer order, by the iudgement of our learned Aduerſaries.

                  5 Wherefore we iudge it to haue bene a point of ſobriety in their Grocinus, ſometimes Diuinity-Reader in S. Paules Church of London, when reading his Lectures out of theſe works attributed vnto Dionyſius, 
                     Gulielmus Grocinus, ſummus Theologus Londini in aede D. Paulo ſacra enarrationem Hierarchiae coeleſtis auſpicaturus, meditata praefatione multum aſſerebat hoc Dionyſij opus fuiſſe, vehementer deſtomachans in eorum impudentiam qui diſſentirent: at idem priuſquam dimidium operis confeciſſet, ac guſtum attentius cepiſſet, ingenuè coram auditorio faſſus eſt, verſo calculo, ſibi non videri id opus Dionyſij Areopagitae fuiſſe.

                     although at the firſt he noted euery one of impudencie, who ſhould dare to denie them to be the proper writings of Dionyſius Areopagita; yet before he had halfe finiſhed his Lectures, he confeſſed ingenuouſly before his auditorie, that he thought them not to be the works of that learned Dionyſius. But we leaue theſe and At the time of the death of the bleſſed Virgin, at our Diuines of Rhemes report, and at S.

                     That the bookes which carrie the name of Dionyſius, are not ſo abſolute, but that they may admit exception; by the iudgement of our learned Aduerſaries.

                  6 If it were granted that this Author was very ancient, who (as Doctor By likelihood Biſhop of Alexandria. M. Fulke againſt the Rhemiſh Teſt ament in 2. Theſſ. 2. Sect. 19. He doth not affirme him to be ſo ancient, neither could he, Origen liuing about the 290. when as this Dionyſius was not extant in the dayes of Athanaſius, about the yeare 340. Fulke but onely ſuppoſeth) might haue bene for name ſake Dionyſius Alexandrinus, the ſcholer of Origen: yet are we to conſider, that theſe works carrie not in them the pretended authority, that we ought by them to be directed in faith: becauſe their ſubiect matter is eſpecially the celeſtiall Hierarchy, or diſtinct orders of Angels, and powers, and dominions celeſtiall. Now we know that S. Paul called ſuch points 2. Cor. 12. 4.

                     albeit many are carried with the opinion of Dionyſius in a doctrine, namely, concerning the office of Seraphins; yet (ſaith he) many moſt graue Fathers, both Greek and Latin, would not accord vnto him; yea, and S. Gregorie would not rest herein, leſt in ſo doing, he might ſeeme to diſſent from the holy Scriptures. As for the names of Angels, he ſaith, that If Dionyſius had learned them of S. Paul, he would not haue concealed it: and concludeth thereof, as of a matter doubtfull and coniecturall.

                  8 For firſt, Prayer for the dead, which was vſed by Dionyſius, (as our D. Fulke hath learnedly obſerued) That Dionyſius doth not ſpeake of praier for the dead, in the Liturg

                     was not a ſupplication, to receiue mercie, but an interpretation, or acknowledgement of mercie receiued.

taught by Dionyſius, their Cardinall Bellarmine (who 
                        Bellarm. lib. 4. de verbo Dei, cap. 7. laboureth to authorize this Author, and citeth him as often as his cauſe will permit) would not haue (as he

                  10 Beſides, the place obiected will anſwer for it ſelfe. It is true that Dionyſius in deſcribing the order of the Chriſtian funerals, ſaith, that the Biſhop or Miniſter doth Accedens diuinus Antiſtes ipſi mortuo ſanctè precatur, atque poſt precationem cum ipſe ſalutat, & ordine omnes qui adſunt: precibus quidem à diuinâ benignitate contēdit, vt omnia peccata, quae humana fragilitate commiſſa ſunt, ei qui exceſſit è vita remittat, & eum in regionem viuorum educat.—Verùm fortaſſè dices, cur id petat Antiſtes?—Hoc ſtatuo cum ſcriptis diuinis, Sanctorum preces in hac vita perutiles eſſe, ſi quis bene animo conſtitutus adeat Sanctum aliquem, & petat vt adiuuet—negligēte diuina humanitate pro benignitate ſua, maculas, quas humana fragilitas contraxit. Anſwering to the queſtion:—Haec Antiſtes ſcit promiſſa eſſe à ſcriptis diuinis quae vera ſunt, petit autem vt ea eueniant, & dentur ijs, qui rectè vixerunt ſancta praemia, ita tamen vt ad Dei imitationem bonitatis ſimilitudine formetur, aliorum ue dona vt ſua beneficia poſcat, & vera promiſſa ſciat futura, eiſque qui adſunt quaſi interpres exponat, ea quae ipſe ex ſancto more & inſtituto repetat, planè euentura eſſe ijs, qui in diuina vita hinc migrauerint. Paulò poſt:—Petit Antiſtes quae à Deo promiſſa ſunt & planè concedenda: in quo & animi ſui conſtitutionem, quae bonitatis diuinae ſpeciem prae ſe fert, Deo, cui boni chari ſunt, declarat: & eis qui adſunt vt interpres, munera & bona, quae ſanctis euentura ſunt, exponit. Dionyſius Areopag. Eccleſ. Hierarch. § Haec quidem. 
                     pray for remiſsion vnto the dead, for the eſcapes committed onely by humane frailtie: but becauſe he had taught, that euery holy and faithfull ſeruant of God, did immediatly attaine vnto the ioyes of heauen, he moueth this queſtion, Why then doth the Miniſter pray to God to helpe him, and what can be the vſe of ſuch prayers? For reſolution hereof he firſt ſheweth, that God of his mercy doth according to his promiſe and gracious bountie, pardon ſuch infirmities: and in the end concludeth, that by that manner of prayer the Miniſter doth nothing elſe, in regard of God, but expreſſe his affection of charity vnto him who is deare in Gods ſight, and his faith in auouching the truth of Gods promiſe, in declaring that he will certainly accept of the ſoule of the departed: and in reſpect of the men there preſent, he doth expound vnto them the certaintie of that hope. So that it may rather be called a proteſtation then a ſupplication, as the circumſtances of the teſtimonie do ſufficiently proue.
                  11 That which may make this queſtion queſtionleſſe, is to obſerue that Dionyſius in the ſame contemplation doth according vnto Scriptures, range the ſoules departed into but two companies, wicked and godly; and of theſe later he doth profeſſe, that Qui verò ſancti vixerunt—Dei vera certaque ſpe promiſſa Dei ſpectantes, diuinae laetitiae pleni ad mortis extremum tanquam ad finem certaminum proficiſcuntur.—Verùm Deus prohibeat ne quis ſanctus vir in huiuſmodi errores incidat, ſed ſciant ſe totos iucundam gratam que requiem eſſe adepturos,—& diuina voluptate complentur propterea quòd mutationem in peius iam non timeant, ſed aeternorum bonorum, quae adepti ſunt, certò ſciant aeternam iam ſibi fore poſſeſſionem.—Propinqui eius qui mortuus eſt, pro iure propinquitatis & morum ſimilitudine beatum cum dicunt, quòd ad victoriae finem peroptatò peruenerit & victoriae authori gratias cum cantu agunt, & propterea ſibi ſimilem requiem optant. Dionyſ. Eccleſ. Hierarch. Perionio Interprete. §. Haec quidem. Compare theſe with that which hath bene deliuered out of Dionyſius aboue, cap. 8. §. 2. 
                     when they are dying, they are filled with diuine comfort in their aſſured and certaine hope, that when they yeeld vp the ghoſts, they ſhall not fall into a worſe ſtate, but poſſeſſe eternall life. But when? Now when they die, ſaith Dionyſius; that is (as Cardinall Bellarmine expoundeth it) Nota dicere Dionyſium à morte hominis ſtatim conſequi immortalitatem. Bellarm. lib. 1. de Beat. Sanct. cap. 4. §. Secundus ſit. 
                     immediatly after death. Vpon the truth of which profeſſion, the faithfull Chriſtians, who do honeſt and honor his funerals, do vſe to congratulate his ſtate of victory with Pſalmes of ioy, and wiſh that they may be made partakers of the ſame reſt. Which argueth no leſſe difference betweene the ſpecified profeſſion of Dionyſius, & the now Romiſh, then there is betweene doubtfulnes in the ſoule departing, and certain and aſſured hope between feare and full ioy: or as between the dolefull ſighs of the by-ſtanders, and their ioyous ſongs of deliuerance: and conſequently as between a Purgatory torment, and a glorious and happy triumph.
                  12 Of Monks we haue ſpoken at large, where the Romiſh order of Monaſticall life, is confeſſed not to be ſo old as the age of Dionyſius Areopagita, by many yeares.
                  
                     
13 Howſoeuer, the Traditions which they would deriue from Dionyſius (as we may perceiue by the Apologiſts account) are neither many: nor yet (if they be rightly conceiued) very weightie. The principall matter is that which they alledge concerning Chriſme and the Sacraments: which we are to diſcuſſe, and ſhew,
               
               
                  
                     That the now doctrine of the Romiſh Church concerning their ſeuen Sacraments, is not from the Catholicke faith of the ancient Fathers, or of the alledged Dionyſius.
                  SECT. 4.
                  14 What a proper and true Sacrament is in the Romiſh doctrine, their Coſterus hath defined, ſaying, that Sacramentum eſt diuinae & inuiſibilis gratiae externum ſignum & viſibile, à Chriſto inſtitutum, vt per id quiſque Dei gratiam accipiat atque ſanctificationem vi ipſius ſacramenti. C

                     it is an outward and viſible ſigne of ſome diuine and inuiſible grace: by vertue of the which Sacrament the Receiuer obtaineth grace and ſanctification. The number of this kind of Sacraments the Councell of Si quis dixerit aut plura eſſe Sacramenta, aut pauciora quàm ſeptem, viz. Bapt. Confirm. Euchariſt, Poenit. Extrē. vnct. Ord.

                  15 We will not put our Aduerſaries to proue by Scripture, that either their ſeuen Sacraments are properly Sacraments, or elſe that the number of true Sacraments is iuſt ſeuen: becauſe when they are brought vnto this triall, we cannot but pitie their See a taſt in the next Section. perplexities. For their inferences are little better then was that argument vſed by their Patriarch of Venice in the Councell of Trent, Dominica Quadrageſ. anno 1563. Tyraboſcus Venetiarum Patriarcha orationem habuit in Concil. Trid. Mundi creationi (inquit) finis ſeptimo die impoſitus eſt▪ ſaturando populo quinque panes, & duo piſces, quae ſeptem efficiunt, ſuffecerunt. Quod D.

At quomodo Concilium panes ſaturando populo inucmet? ſeptem nempe conſtituendo Sacramenta. Gentillet. Exam. Conc. Trid. lib. 4. Seſſ. 22. num. 26. who from that hiſtory of Chriſt [feeding ſo many thouſands with fiue loues and two fiſhes,] which make vp in all, the number of ſeuen, and whereof Chriſt ſaid, [It is ſufficient,] did (as our Gentilletus reporteth) conclude, that from the ſence of that place the Sacraments of the Church muſt be fully ſeuen. Our preſent charge is to ſeeke the voice of Antiquitie.
                  16 Herein our Aduerſaries ſeeme to be confident, ſaying, that Fundatur autem haec veritas in Eccleſiaſtica Traditione, quae docet Chriſtum illa ſeptem iuſtituiſſe; & non plura. Suarez Ieſ. Tom. 3. diſp. 12. §. 1. 
                     the truth of this aſſertion, viz. the Sacraments are neither more nor fewer then ſeuen, is grounded vpon Eccleſiaſticall Tradition, which teacheth that Chriſt did inſtitute theſe ſeuen. But being required to proue the exact neceſſity of this number of ſeuen out of the Fathers, they anſwer, that they are not to be charged to ſhew Non debere aduerſarios petere à nobis vt oſtendamus in Scripturis aut Patribus nomen ſeptenarij numeri Sacramentorum: Scriptura enim & Patres non ſcripſerunt Catechiſmum. Bellar. lib. 2. de effect. Sacram. cap. 24. 
                     either out of Scriptures, or out of Fathers the name of ſeuen Sacraments, becauſe the Fathers writ no Catechiſmes. We exact not the name of the number ſeuen, but onely as two and three make fiue, ſo would we haue demonſtration

that any of the Fathers in any place, writing of the Sacraments of the new Teſtament, did giue any certaine intimation of the number of ſeuen? They anſwer, that although this ſet number of ſeuen, is not intimated by any Father, Satis eſt quòd Patres in varijs locis, aut certè varij eiuſdem aetatis Patres omnium ſeptē Sacramentorum alicubi meminerint. Bellarm. lib. 2. de Sacram. in genere, cap. 27. Tametſi Patres non omninò numerent ſimul in aliquo loco Sacramenta ſeptem; tamen &c. Greg. Valen. Ieſ. lib. de numero Sacram. cap. 1. 
                     yet must we be content, that here & there they haue mentioned them. Which is knowne to be a lame and halting conſequence, to any one who remembreth that the Fathers vſed to extend the name of Sacramēt vnto many things which our Aduerſaries themſelues know to be no proper Sacraments; as for example, Auguſt lib. 2. de pecea. merit. & remiſſ. cap. 26 Cibum ſanctificatum, qui Catechumenis dabatur Sacramentum appellat. Et lib. 4. de Symb. cap. 1. Exorciſmos Sacramenta appellat: lib. 19. contra Fauſtum Manichaeum, cap. 14. Crucis ſignum Sacramentum nominat. Suarez Ieſ. Tom. 3. diſp. 14. §. 2. Thus is obiected, wherunto afterwards he anſwereth, that the word Sacrament among the Fathers was vſed largo modo. 
                     meate giuen vnto the Catechumenists: the ſigne of the Croſſe: yea and the Auguſt. de bono coniugali, cap. 18. Sacramentum plurium vxorum ſignificat multitudinem omnium terrarum Deo ſubiectam. 
                     Polygamie, or multitude of wiues, which the Patriarchs did enioy, S. Auguſtine doth terme by the name of Sacraments. Why then ſhould we not rather be directed by the teſtimonies of Fathers, where (as our 
                        Auguſt. epiſt. 118. lib. 3. doctr. Chriſt. cap. 9. Ambroſ. lib. de. Sacram. Iuſtinus Martyr Apol. 2. Tertull. lib 4. contra Marc. cap. 34. Cyril. de Catecheſ. Kemnitius Exam. Conc. Trid. de Sacram. part 2. Authors haue obſerued) the Fathers intreating more preciſely of the Sacraments of the new Teſtament, do onely expreſſe two, Baptiſme, and the Euchariſt: amongſt others, S. Ambroſe in his Treatiſe properly written of the Sacraments, and S. Cyril in his booke intituled a Catechiſme?
                  
                  17 As for their Dionyſius, it may be that Proteſtants (anſwering vnto him as he was obiected by the Romaniſts, to confirme ſixe Sacraments,) might generally anſwer (not as confeſſing, but onely as ſuppoſing that he taught ſixe) by denying his authority: for their owne learned Cardinall Dionyſius in Eccleſ. Hierarch. Tractar de Bapt. & Euchar.—Item de conſecratione olei, de ordin. Clericorum—caetera tria omiſit,—nec tamen ignorauit ſacram Poenit. Bellar. lib. 2. de effect. Sacram cap. 27. §. Ad. Bellarmine can find in him but fiue, and we thinke he would not haue willingly miſſed of his account. And yet of thoſe fiue he might well abate one, if not three; for Dionyſius doth no more eſteeme the conſecration by oyle to be a Sacrament, then he doth the Mentioned by Dionyſius in the ſame place. 
                     annointing with oyle the corps of the dead, in testimony of the hope of reſurrection: which ceremony the Church of Rome doth neither vſe, nor Quae ſine dubio Sacramentum non erat, ſed pia quaedam caeremonia. Suarez Ieſ. Tom. 4. diſp. 39. ſect. 1. num. 10. approue for a Sacrament. So that by their conſequence taken from the authority of Dionyſius, to proue ſix, they are chargeable to allow an eighth; ſo vnreaſonable is their reaſon takē from this witneſſe.
                  18 What then is the greateſt ſtrength of the Romiſh defence for ſeuen? 
                     Hanc veritatem inſinuauerat Conc. Florentinum, expreſſiùs verò Trid Conc. Seſſ. 7. cap. 1. Suarez Ieſ. Tom. 3. diſp. 12. Sect. 1. §. Secundo. 
                     The Councell of Florence (ſay they) did inſinuate this truth: and the Councell of Trent did expreſly define it. Vpon this foundation dependeth their laſt reſolutiō of ſeuen, Ergo 
                     Id quod Eccleſia Chriſti de numero Sacramentorum tradit, id ſine omni dubitatione credendum eſt: ſed Eccleſia tradit non eſſe vel plura vel pauciora. Ergo. Greg. de Valen. Ieſ. lib. de numero Sacram. cap. 1. we muſt beleeue that there are neither more, nor fewer then ſeuen. But if not the ſilence of ancient Fathers, who haue neuer taught this, yet the ingenuous confeſſions of their owne brethren muſt ſomewhat preiudice their concluſion. Heare therefore
               
               
                  
                     The Romiſh number of ſeuen proper Sacraments abated, by the confeſsion of our learned Aduerſaries.
                  
                  SECT. 5.
                  19 Let vs remember, when we ſpeake of Sacraments, what we haue

in queſtion: firſt we talke of Sacraments properly ſo called: for if we ſhould ſpeake of improper Sacraments, which are mentioned of ancient Fathers, our Aduerſarie will not denie, that not onely ſeuen, but euen So many as there be ſignes of holy things. ſeuentie ſeuen Sacraments might be named. Next, in all proper Sacraments they and we 
                        See aboue §. 3. require, that they haue their inſtitution from Chriſt, and a power of conferring ſanctifying grace vpon euery rightly conſtituted and prepared receiuer: and of this kind they haue propounded fully and onely ſeuen, to be beleeued vnder the danger of Anathema and curſe vpon euery ſoule that ſhall except againſt any one of them.
                  20 Now then let them but giue vs leaue to beleeue their owne Authors, & we ſhal eaſily manifeſt, that this their profeſſion concerning the nū
                     ber of Sacraments was not held Catholicke, no not in the Church of Rome, vntill more then a thouſand yeares after Chriſt: for Non temerè quemquam repeties ante Petrum Lombardum, qui certū aliquem ac definitum numerū Sacramentorum ſtatuerat. Et de his ſeptem non omnes quidem Scholaſtici

                     vntill the daies of Peter Lombard (who liued about the yeare 1151,) you ſhal ſcarce find any author (ſaith their Caſſander) who ſet downe any certaine and definite number of Sacraments: neither did all the Schoolemen call all thoſe ſeuen, proper Sacraments. We may trie the truth of this generall aſſertion by three particular inſtances.
                  21 Firſt, two of their ancient Schoole, to wit, Confirmationem non eſſe à Chriſto inſtitutam, falſa opinio ſuit, & poſt Eccleſiae declarationes planè eſt haeretica.—Alenſem eodē tempore refutauit Albertus magous, & Thomas. Greg. Valē. Ieſ. de num. Sacr. cap. 3. §. Verum.

                     denie that confirmation was from Christs institution: and we know that (as their Councell of Trent hath truly defined) * onely Christ can inſtitute a proper Sacrament.
                  
                  22 Secondy, Matrimonie is numbred among the ſeuen, which their Coūcel of Si quis dixerit &c. Conc. Trid. Seſſ. 24. can. 1.

                     Becauſe (ſay they) if it were not ordained by Chriſt, it cannot be accounted properly a Sacrament.

                  24 Neceſſarie therefore it is, (according to the definition of their laſt Councell) they proue the inſtitution thereof from Chriſt, before it may be preſumed to be a right and perfect Sacrament.

                        See §. 1. Author, named Dionyſius, is not ſo currant, nor his §. 2. authoritie ſo abſolute, nor his §. 4. 5. particulars of praier for the dead, Monks, Traditions, and Sacraments ſo pertinent, as our Aduerſaries would pretend: whoſe now article of §. 4. 
                     faith, concerning the iuſt nūber of ſeuen Sacraments, hath bene tried by the confeſſion of their Doctors to be but newly impoſed, eſpecially in theſe §. 5. three, Confirmation, Matrimonie, and Extreme vnction. So may we perceiue the inualiditie, if not iniquitie of the Romiſh claime. How much more ſenſible will this be, if we ſhould inſtance from Dionyſius, againſt the Romiſh doctrine of multitude of ceremonies, priuate Maſſe, proper Sacrifice, Purgatory torment, praiers in an vnknowne tongue, and other controuerted Articles, as they are now profeſſed in the Romane Church? From Dionyſius they flie vnto Hermes.

                  SECT. 1.
                  
                     BEfore we ſpeake of the faith of Hermes, neceſſarie it is, that we ſhew what may be our faith of this Hermes, which booke the Apologiſts contend to proue to haue bene in the Church, if not of Canonicall, yet at leaſt of Eccleſiaſticall authority. But what hath bene, and what ought to be our eſtimation hereof, the Apologiſts might haue learned, if not from the iudgement of our Scultetus & other Proteſtants by them alledged, who account of them to be Libri vt venuſti, ita fabuloſi ſunt, &c. Scultetus in the place cited by the Apologiſts.
                      
                     fine, but fabulous, yet from the cenſure of their owne beſt approued Doctors.
                  2 Firſt, Sixtus Senenſis examining the credit of this booke of Hermes, aliâs Paſtor, ſaith, that Hoc opus olim publicè in quibuſdam Graeciae Eccleſijs legebatur ad inſtitutionem eorum, qui primis ad fidei inſtitut. inſtruebantur clementis; multiue veteres Patres eius teſtimonijs ad dogmatum confirmationem vſi ſunt: poſt quo
                        
                           •
                        um tempora authoritas huius libri paulatim defecit, & à Gelaſio demum inter Scripturas dubiae fidei reiecta eſt, vt arbitror, ad haereticorum ſubuerſionem, qui inde execrabilium dogmatum praeſidia aſſumebant. Sixtus Senenſis Bibl. lib 2. Tit. Hermes. 
                     the authority hereof decayed, and was accounted by Pope Gelaſius among the Authors of ſuſpected credit: which Gelaſius did, as I thinke, (ſaith Senenſis) for the ſubuerſion of thoſe hereticks, who from that booke did gather ſtrength for the maintenance of their execrable opinions.

Sed & i Gelaſio aequè inter Apocrypha recenſetur; vſos eo quoque fuiſſe Arianos ad ſuam haereſin confirmandam, teſtatur S. Athanaſius, &c. Cardinalis Baronius anno Chriſti 159. num. 5. 6. Baronius ſaith of the ſame booke, that Origen indeed cited it, but confeſſeth alſo that it was contemned of ſome in his time: which the Latine Fathers reckoned in the number of thoſe Apocryphall bookes that were read for inſtructions in maners, but not for confirmation of any matter of faith: which Tertullian afterwards did abhorre, calling it adulterous: which S. Proſper, in his diſpute with one, who thereby would haue confirmed an error, did eſteeme of no authority: and from which the Arrian hereticks (as witneſſeth Athanaſius) did confirme their hereſies.

Which

                        cipit Eccleſia Catholica Romana; nam è quibus pauca, quae ad memoriam venerunt, & quae à Catholicis vitāda ſunt, credimus eſſe ſubdenda imprimis &c.—Item & libet Paſtoris Apocryphus, & libri omnes quos fecit Lenticius diſcipulus diabolt, Apocryphi &c. And Gelaſius concludeth his decree, concerning theſe bookes, thus: Haec & omnia his ſimilia &c. non ſolum repudiata, verumetiam ab omni Romana Eccleſia eliminata, at que cum ſuis authoribus & ſequacibus cum Anathematis indiſſolubili vinculo confitemur eſſe damnata. Gelaſius Papa apud Gratian. diſt. 15. cap. 3. Gelaſius againſt it, doth fully diſcouer, in the end concluding thus; All ſuch like we confeſſe not only to be refuſed of the Romane Church, but alſo to be cast out and abandoned, and finally with all the authors and allowers of them, to be with an vnſeparable curſe of an Anathema vtterly condemned.
                  
                  5 Thus (we ſee) how farre theſe Apologiſts haue bene tranſported with preiudice, the nource of all errours; who (that they might draw Proteſtants into the ſuſpition of contumacy, for reiecting the authority of an author intituled Hermes, or Paſtor,) haue honoured him with an opinion of S. Pauls ſcholer, and haue approued his authority, as being at the leaſt, Eccleſiaſticall; neuer regarding either the exact iudgement of Proteſtants in refuſing it, or elſe the confeſſions of their owne moſt authorized Doctors in commending the wiſdome of ſome ancients, who haue contemned it as falſe and adulterous: but notwithſtanding ſuch euidence, do by the ſentences of this Author piece out a part of their artificial Catholicke Apologie. Now what ſhal it aduantage them if Proteſtants haue granted that there is in this booke Poperie, wherein their owne Romaniſts confeſſe ſo many ſeeds of hereſie to be found?
                  6 Neuertheleſſe, in the bookes of Hermes, which are put into their Bibliotheke of holy Fathers, few of their particulars can be found; in ſo much as our greateſt 
                        Bellarmine in theſe ſeuerall controuerſies, where he ſeeketh to proue theſe particulars of Freewill, &c. although he cite Dionyſius Areopagita for votum continentiae; yet the authoritie of this Hermes he pretermitteth in theſe queſtions.

               CHAP. XXVIII. Of their laſt Argument from Antiquitie: taken from the Rule of S. Auguſtine.
               THE ROMISH APOLOGIE.
               14 Fourteenthly, whereas the Lord Archbiſhop of Ca
                        •
                     terbury doth againſt Cartwright learnedly and truly vrge this generall rule or proofe of Apoſtolicke doctrine, ſaying, 
                  M. Whitgift in his defence, &c. pag. 351. For ſo much as the originall and beginning of theſe names, Metropolitane, Archbiſhop, &c. ſuch is their antiquitie, cannot be found ſo farre as I haue read, it is to be ſuppoſed they haue their originall from the Apoſtles themſelues. For as I remember S. Auguſtine hath this rule in his 118. Epiſtle. In ſo much as he yet further ſaith in proofe of this rule, 
                  M. Whitgift vbi ſupra, pag. 352. It is of credit with the writers of out time, namely with M. Zuinglius, M. Caluin, and M. Gualter, and ſurely I thinke no learned man doth diſſent from them.
               
                  It is now by the premiſſes made more then euident, that the ſeuerall doctrines of our faith, are according to this rule, no leſſe free from all noted and knowne beginning ſince the Apoſtles times, then are the other foreſaid doctrines of Metropolitanes, and Archbiſhops: a thing ſo manifeſt, that M. Cartwright (though our great aduerſarie) doubteth not yet further to
                  
                  acknowledge the ſame, ſaying therefore of this very rule in plaine words, 
                  See M. Cartwrights words in M. Whitgifts foreſaid defence &c. pag. 352. initio. That thereby a window is open to bring in all Popery: and 
                  M. Cartwright alledged ibid. pag. 103. paulò ante med I appeale (ſaith he) to the iudgement of all men, if this be not to bring in Popery againe, to allow of S. Auguſtines ſaying: &c. So euidently do our owne learned Aduerſaries, confirme and proue our foreſaid Catholike Religion, whereto we were ſo many ages ſince conuerted, to be vndoubtedly Apostolicke.
               
               
                  THE PROTESTANTS APPEALE.
                  SECT. 1.
                  
                     WEll may we thinke that the Apologiſts by 
                        See before in the queſtion of Traditions, Chap. 25. twice inſtancing in this argument, haue put therein a double confidence. Which whether it proceed from the ſtrength of good conſequence, and not rather from the weakneſſe of their iudgement, we permit vnto the equall cenſure of our Reader, after that we haue diſcuſſed theſe foure points. 1. what was the rule of S. Augustine deliuered, which is the ſubiect of this diſpute. 2. what is the argument of our reuerend Biſhop from that rule. 3. the inference of M. Cartwright from that argument. 4 the collection of the Apologiſts vpon that inference, and concluſion. To beginne at the firſt,
               
               
                  The rule of S. Auguſtine.
                  SECT. 2.
                  2 S. Auguſtine, who conſonantly vnto other Fathers had pronounced of 
                        See before Chap. 25. 
                     all things neceſſary to be beleeued, that they are contained in Scripture, (wherby is auouched the ſufficiency of Scripture in all doctrines of faith,) he in the place now obiected (being the 118. Epiſtle ad Ianuarium,) deliuereth rules concerning onely the rites and ceremonies of the Church: whereof ſome were then vſed vniuerſally in all Chriſtian Churches, as namely the ſolemne and yearly celebrations of the daies of Chriſts paſsion, reſurrection, and aſcenſion, &c. Of this kind of cuſtome he giueth this Axiome; Illa autem quae non ſcripta ſunt ſed tradita cuſtodimus, quae quidem toto terrarum orbe obſeruantur, dantur intelligi vel ab ipſis Apoſtolis, vel plenarijs Concilijs, quorum eſt in Eccleſia celebetrima authoritas, commendata atque ſtatuta retineri, ſicut quòd Dominici paſſio, & reſurrectio, & aſcenſio in coelum, & aduentus de coelo Spiritus ſancti, anniuerſaria ſolennitate celebrantur: & ſi quid aliud quod ſeruatur ab vniuerſa quacunque ſe diffundit Eccleſia. Auguſt. epiſt. 118. ad Ianuar. cap. 1. & paulò poſt. cap. 5. Similiter enamſi quod horum tota per orbem frequentat Eccleſia, nam hoc quin ita faciendum ſit, inſolentiſſimae eſt inſaniae. Ibidem.
                      
                     Whatſoeuer is not written, but is deliuered by Tradition, and is obſerued in the Churches throughout the world, is to be vnderſtood to haue bene ordained either by the Apoſtles, or elſe by generall Councels, which are of moſt renowmed authoritie in the Church.
                  
                  3 Beſides theſe vniuerſall Traditions, Alia verò quae per loca terrarum regioneſue variantur, ſicuti eſt quòd alij ieiunant Sabbato, alij verò non, alij quotidiè communicant corpori Dominico, alij certis diebus accipiunt.—Totum hoc genus liberas habet obſeruationes, nec vlla alia diſciplina melior eſt graui prudentiue Chriſtiano, quàm vt eo modo agar, quo agere viderit Eccleſiam, ad quamcunque deuenerit: quod enim neque contra fidem, neque contra bonos mores iniungitur, indifferenter eſt habendum, & pro eorum, inter quos viuitur, ſocietate eſt ſeruandum.—Ambroſius reſpondet, cùm, inquit, Romam venio, ieiuno Sabbato▪ cùm bic ſum, non ieiuno: ſic tu ad quamcunque fortè Eccleſiam veneris, eius mor

                     other cuſtomes & ceremonies there be (ſaith he) which be particularly obſerued in ſome particular countries, as ſomewhere to faſt on the Sabboth, but otherwhere it is otherwiſe. And concerning theſe he hath another rule, to wit, Whenſoeuer any man ſhall come into any particular Church and country, where any cuſtome or ceremonie is enioyned, which is
                     
                     not contrarie either vnto ſaith, or good manners, he ought in wiſdome to obſerue the rites there vſed, thereby to auoid a double ſcandall, both of himſelfe vnto others, and of others vnto himſelfe. Theſe be the golden Rules which S. Auguſtine preſcribeth for a Chriſtian mans direction in the caſe of ceremonies. The firſt of theſe is that rule which the Apologiſts haue choſen to oppoſe againſt vs; let vs repeate
               
               
                  The argument which Archbiſhop Whitgiſt hath vſed and vrged, taken from S. Augustines rule.
                  SECT. 3.
                  4 Out of the Apolog. 
                     Foraſmuch (ſaith he) as the originall and beginning of theſe names of Metropolitane, Archbiſhop &c. ſuch is their antiquitie, cannot be found, ſo farre as I haue read: it is to be ſuppoſed they haue their originall from the Apostles themſelues.
                  
                  5 We ſhall not need to diſpute with the Apologiſts of the truth of this conſequent, for they confeſſe that it is learnedly and truly vrged; yet would it become them to know the meaſure thereof by a double dimenſion, bredth and depth: the bredth reacheth no further then vnto matters of ceremonies, and other customes of the Church. For as for doctrines of faith, (if they ſhall be applied vnto this rule,) theſe are the Churches concluſions, and are ſo farre to be beleeued as they depend vpon their authenticall premiſſes, euen the ſacred Scriptures; which we haue proued from S. Auguſtine, and other Fathers to be the perfect treaſurie of all fundamentall principles of Faith.
                  6 Secondly, the depth of the ſame poſition, if it be rightly ſounded, will be found to be a truth of So B. Whitgift, with others. ſtrong probability onely, and not of an abſolute infallibility; as may ſeeme to be intimated both by the word [ſuppoſed,] which is vſed by our learned Archbiſhop, and alſo by the confeſſion of Ieſuits, who grant, that the names of Metropolitane and Archbiſhop are not Apoſtolicall, but Apoſtolicae Traditiones ſunt Quadrag

                     The inference made by M. Cartwright vpon the former argument, is infirme.
                  
                  SECT. 4.
                  7 By this rule (ſaith he) a window is opened to bring in all Popery: and for

the euidence of his inference, he aduentureth to appeale vnto the iudgement of all men; but herein hath he bewraied a double defect of iudgement in himſelfe. For by that rule of S. Auguſtine (which implieth onely matters ceremoniall and Eccleſiaſticall Conſtitutions,) to enforce all Popery (which ſtandeth vpon many doctrinall points of faith,) is no leſſe errour in true ſcholerſhip, then from a particular propoſition to inferre an vniuerſall concluſion. * See hereafter where the new Romiſh inuentions are fully diſcouered. Whereas, indeed contrariwiſe our graue and iudicious Archbiſhop hath well and truly replied, that Archb. Whitgift in the place alledged by the Apolog. 
                     this rule of S. Auguſtine is ſo farre from authorizing Poperie, that it rather quite ouerthroweth the ſame; for that by it is confuted the Supremacy of the Pope ouer all other Churches, which hath neither ben alwaies, nor in all places: as hath bene alſo proued, and 
                        See aboue, Cap. 18. may be further confirmed, not onely in matters of Eccleſiaſticall rites and orders, but euen in queſtions which concerne the ſoule of Religion.
                  8 But he held it ſufficient, in ſpeaking of Poperie, to ſtrike onely at the head thereof, by inſtancing in the Primacie of the Pope: which is ſo true, that S. Auguſtine himſelfe, who is the author of that Rule, may be the iuſtifier of his application. For in the caſe of Appiarius, a wicked Prieſt (who being excommunicated by his owne Biſhops, ſought to be reſtored by Pope Celeſtine) Erat Conciliū Carthaginenſe, anno Dom. 419. in cauſa Appiarij Presbyteri.

Augustine was one, did withſtand the Appeales from Africke vnto the See of Rome, preferring the iudgement of a prouinciall Synode before the command or iuriſdiction of the Pope. And could the Papal Primacy, which is the head of Popery, receiue a deeper wound then this was? wherof we may iudge better by the plaiſter which their Cardinall Bellarmine hath prepared in the way of anſwer and ſatisfaction. [Niſi fortè (ſaith the Councell) quiſquam eſt qui credat vnicuilibet Deū poſſe examinis inſpir are iuſtitiam, & innumerabilibus congregatis in Concilium Sacerdotibus denegare.] Reſpondeo,—non neceſſariò tenemur credere quidquid in ea epiſtola Epiſcopi illi dicant, praeſertim cum ſatis appareat, cos commotos ſceleribus Appiarij, qui ad Rom. Pontificem confugerat, modum in verbis non nihil exceſſiſſe. Bellarm. lib. 4. de Rom. Pont. cap. 7. §. Quarta ratio, &c. 
                     I anſwer (ſaith he) that we are not bound to beleene whatſoeuer the Biſhops of that Councell writ in that Epiſtle, eſpecially knowing that they were then much moued with the miſchiefes wrought by Appiarius, (who then fled vnto the Biſhop of Rome,) and ſomewhat exceeded meaſure in their words.
                  
                  9 But we ſtand not vpon words, but examine their deeds, and hereuppon demaund which ſide may rather be thought to haue exceeded meaſure? whether that Councell which excommunicated ſo notorious a man, or the Pope, who endeauoured to reſtore him? Then let vs compare S. Auguſtines conſent vnto that Councell, with his now obiected rule, and do they not both iuſtifie our Archbiſhops Aſſertion in the confutation of the now vſurped Papall ſupremacie? So now we ſee that little window, which ſeemed to be open vnto all Popery, to be cloſely ſhut, and a great doore opened for the maintenance of the liberty of other prouinciall Councels in all their iuſt oppoſitions againſt the Pope. It remaineth we anſwer vnto
               
               
                  The Apologists collection, which is taken from the former erroneous Inference: prouing it to be deceitfull.
                  SECT. 5.
                  10 Theſe Apologiſts working artificially vpon the abouenamed miſconſtruction of that rule of S. Auguſtine, make it one of their premiſes,

whereby euidently to confirme their foreſaid religion: yet when we conſulted with S. Auguſtine concerning the ground of all doctrine, he told vs that nothing is neceſſarie, which is not contained in Scripture: which ouerthroweth the Romiſh religion in their traditionall doctrines.
                  11 When we ſeeke his iudgement concerning rituall and ceremoniall Conſtitutions, he requireth the vſe of that Leni nos iugo Chriſtus ſubiecit, & leui ſarcinae. Auguſt. epiſt. 118.

                        See aboue lib. 1. cap. 3. haue bene manifeſted to be for number more then Iewiſh, many for obſeruation ſuperſtitious, and ſome alſo in ſignification ridiculous.
                  12 Wherefore ſeeing the Apologiſts, when they could not be ignorant of M. Cartwrights miſapplication of that rule, or of our Archbiſhops learned replie, yet durſt aduenture to lay the whole frame of all Romiſh religiō vpon this one ſilly Aſſumptiō, taken but from one diſtreſſed Anſwerer, by miſconſtruction of but one teſtimonie of S. Auguſtine, which can but onely probably proue their intent; they ſtand herein thrice reproucable, and may worthily exemplifie the parable of our Sauiour in the Goſpell, where the vnwiſe man is ſaid to build his whole houſe vpon the Matth. 7. 26.

For firſt, to know whether it be generally inexpedient for men not to marry, doth neceſſarily concerne the Church both to vnderſtand and teach: as when Chriſts diſciples obiected ſaying, Then it is not expedient for a man to marry; and our Maſter anſwered,

This Councell is ancient, euen 1300 yeares ago (according vnto Binius,) wherein there was a conſent of Fathers in a definitiue ſentence, no Father of that age, or of many ages after contradicting their determination.

they challenge this authority herein, vpon a pretence that Secundò dum prohibetur Bertramus, nego prohiberi Patrem; nam Eccleſiae Pater ille eſt, qui ſalutari doctrinâ Eccleſiam alit & paſcit:—ſi pro tritico lolium admiſcuerit, eatenus non pater eſt, ſed vitricus, non Doctor, ſed ſeductor.—Quartò inſuetum non eſt, vt veteres damnentur errores, ſi nocendo fiant noui.—exemplum habemu

                     the father is no naturall father, but a ſtep-father, who nouriſheth not the Church with wholſome food, but mixeth darnell and pernicious graine with the wheate: therefore as the Popes (ſay they) haue dealt with ſome writings of Origen and Tertullian, by the ſame right may they now (according to their wiſdome,) aboliſh any writings of others, either in whole or in part, by cutting or blotting them out. And ſo it may come to paſſe, that the Fathers ſhall not onely be no Iudges, but euen no Doctors of the Church; for they may be ſilenced by their Popes, who are in our Aduerſaries doctrine the Fathers of Fathers: and this muſt be the end of their diſputes, not by perſwading, but by commaunding a conſent.

                  The neceſſarie cautions, which are to be vſed in the allegations of bookes of antiquitie.

The firſt caution is, that they bring vs the teſtimonies of true Fathers; otherwiſe the ſubornation of counterfeit witneſſes, muſt argue the weakneſſe of the cauſe.

If this Argument may paſſe for currant for the iuſtifying of the Iewes, to free them from the ſuſpition of a wilfull deprauing of any ſentence of Canonicall Scriptures, ſhal it not be of more weight to abſolue them from diſmembring whole bookes of holy writ? Yes verily: for it will be confeſſed by their Cardinall Bellarmine, that the Iewes were alwaies ſo religious, that they would 
                        See hereafter cap. 16. §. 3. 
                     chooſe rather to die an hundred deaths, then to ſuffer any corruption of the holy Scriptures.
                  
                  6 Againe, we cannot, but acknowledge the obſeruation of their Cardinall Caietan to be verie ſound and iudicious: Duas maximas vtilitates ex Iudaeorum obſtinatione percipimus, altera eſt fides librorum ſacrorum. Si enim omnes Iudaei conuerſi eſſent ad Chriſtum, putaret iam mundus Iudaeorum adinuentionem fuiſſe—quòd fuerit promiſſus Meſſias. Sed vbi inimici Chriſti Iudaei perſeuerant, & teſtantur nullos alios apud Patres fuiſſe libros Canonicè ſacros, niſi iſtos. &c. Caiet. Card. com. in Rom.

                     All Chriſtians (ſaith he) receiue a double benefit by the apoſtacie and obſtinacie of the 
                           •
                        ewes; one is to know which are the true bookes of the old Testament: for if all the Iewes had bene conuerted vnto the faith of Chriſt, then would the world haue ſuſpected that the Iewes had inuented thoſe promiſes which are of Chriſt the Meſsias: but now inaſmuch as the Iewes are enemies vnto Chriſt, they beare witneſſe vnto vs, that there are no other bookes Canonicall (meaning, of the old Teſtament) then thoſe which the Iewes themſelues haue acknowledged. So that we may well thinke that that Church is leſſe Chriſtian, which is not more Iewiſh in this Article concerning the Canon of holy Scriptures, eſpecially ſeeing (as will be confeſſed) the ancient Fathers did embrace the iudgement of the Iewes in this point.
                  7 Let now any ſenſible braine of any Chriſtian man, vnderſtand that the Romaniſts (who ſtand conuicted in this firſt and higheſt point of all controuerſies, euē the diſcerning of the true Oracles of God) pretend a demonſtration of their faith out of the doctrine of ancient Iewes: and he may conſequently iudge what is the vanitie of their challenge, wherein they haue aduentured to profeſſe, and that in print, See the Apologie in the beginning of this third booke. 
                     concerning ſuch articles of faith now in queſtion, that whenſoeuer vpon any occaſion direct mention is made of any of them, either of thoſe that were before Chriſt, or by the Iewiſh Rabbins ſince, it is ſtill with vs (ſay they) against our Aduerſaries. This their darkneſſe in this one point is afterward more fully diſcouered by examples of al the Churches of the world in the primitiue age after Chriſt, and by the confeſſions of many Romane Aduerſaries witneſſing the ſame truth of our profeſſion concerning the Canon of Scriptures of the old Teſtament. Now we come to the firſt queſtion.
               
            
            
               CHAP. II. Of Praier for the dead; out of the booke of Macchabees.
               THE ROMISH APOLOGIE.
               
                  It may not be denied but that long before Chriſts time, Iudas Macchabeus (the vndoubted ſeruant of God) 
                  2. Macchab. 2. 43. 
                  procured ſacrifice for the dead: that the Prieſts at Hieruſalem accordingly
                  
                  offered 
                  2. Machab. 2. 45. Solie made a reconciliation for the dead, that they might be deliuered from ſinne.
                   
                  it, and that the Author of the Hiſtorie ſo many yeares after commended 
                  2. Machab. 2. 45. It was a holy and good thought, & vide ibidem, verſe 43.

                      Romaniſt almoſt falleth into this argument of Praier for the dead, but he preſently pointeth at this place with an 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , as though this were in it ſelfe ſufficient to confound any Proteſtant: but we anſwer by examination 1. of the Tranſlator, 2. the Relator, 3. the Actor, and 4. the authoritie of this ſtorie, now mentioned.
                  2 The tranſlation is according to the vulgar Latine, which D. 
                        Lib 1. de Idolat. cap. 5. Sect. 8 & 9. 
                     Reynolds hath proued from all the Greeke Originals, & many Latine copies to be corrupted, which hath it thus; Et factâ collatione &c. that is, And hauing made a gathering, he ſent twelue thouſand drachmes of ſiluer to Ieruſalem, to be offered for a ſacrifice for the ſinnes of the dead. The word [mortuorum,] of the dead, is added, euen as is the naming of twelue thouſand drachmes in ſtead of two thouſand: as though they meant hereby to enlarge their royall exchange of Indulgences.
                  3 Secondly, the Relator Iaſon Cyrenaeus, who calleth himſelfe the 2. Machab. 2. 24. 
                     abridger of this ſtorie, hath bene ſhewed by Deinde totum illud, &c. Our Zanchius de diuin. attrib. lib. 4 cap. 4. Zanchius to haue bene rather an enlarger of it, by adding vnto it more then is to be found either in the Hebrew Ben gorion. lib. 3. cap. 19. or elſe in the Greeke hiſtories of Ioſephus, who haue both recorded this ſtorie.
                  
                  4 But if we ſhould allow for diſputatiō ſake, the ſtorie to be truly expreſſed, and that (which ſome See D. Reynolds, and Hierome Zanchie, in the ſame places. impugne) this Sacrifice had bene offred by means of the Actor Iudat Macchabaus, for the dead, and not onely for the liuing; yet muſt we conſider that it was for the behoofe of thoſe dead, who had taken Iewels conſecrated vnto Idols, which was forbidden by the law, Deut. 7. This was a ſinne, yea and ſuch a ſinne, that this 
                        The ſinne of Acan, Ioſh. 7. 1. one was the onely cauſe why many periſhed in the hoaſt of Iſrael: which argueth that it was an hainous ſinne.
                  5 Finally, theſe being now ſlaine, the idolatrous Iewels (the matter of their ſinne) 2. Machab. 12. verſ. 40. 
                     are found vnder the coats of euerie one of them: which proueth, that as they died for ſinne, ſo they died in their ſinne. And will our Aduerſaries allow publike praiers to be made for thoſe who die in 
                        They will not. See aboue in the queſtions of Purgatory and Sacrifice. Mortale peccatum eſt reatus, cui, quantum eſt in ſeſolùm, ſemper debetur aeterna damnatio. Vega lib. 14. de peccat. mort. & ven. cap. 16. fol. 640. 
                     mortall ſinne? But they Greg Valent. Ieſ. lib. de Purgat. ſuppoſe that ſome of theſe had repented; yet becauſe this could but only be ſuppoſed, it may be demanded of our Aduerſaries, whether they will allow publike praiers to be made ſpecially and by name for any publike tranſgreſſors, who are not knowne to haue giuen any ſenſible teſtimonie of repentance? How then ſhall the Romaniſts iuſtifie this example?
                  6 For as in earthly building, we are not to apply the rule vnto the ſtone, but the ſtone vnto the rule; ſo in ſpirituall edification, Gods To the law, and to the teſtimonie. Eſa 8. 20. law muſt not be examined by example, but example by law. And ſeeing (as their Ieſuite confeſſeth) Neque certè dubitandum eſt quin orandi inſtitutum pro defunctis ex Maiorum traditione Macchabaei acceperint, cum in lege quidem nihil de ea re ſcriptum ſit. Gregor. Valent. Ieſuita, Anal. fid. lib. 8. cap. 6. §. Sic et. 
                     the ordinance of praier for the dead is not found written in the law
                     
                     of God, we preſume his act cannot be thought lawfull, in ſeeking a 
                        Verſ. 43. 
                     Sacrifice of ſinne-offering in behalfe of the ſlaine.
                  7 To pretend that he was warranted by the law of ſome 
                        Greg. Valent. ſuprà, lit. l. 
                     vnwritten Tradition, is a coniecture contradicted by 
                        See hereafter cap. 8. Sect. 4. p Leuit. 5. our Aduerſaries, and oppugneth the perfection of Gods written will. For if God did ſo particularly and preciſely ordaine in his writen law p ſin-offerings for treſpaſſes of only bodily pollution by touching of the carrion of dead beasts, would he haue omitted mention of Sacrifices for the precious ſoules of men, if any ſuch had bene behoouefull for the dead? Thus much of the Actor Iudas.
                  
                  8 Howſoeuer, (that we may come to ſpeake of the authoritie of this ſtorie,) our Aduerſaries are not ignorant, that not onely all the Iewes, but the moſt ancient Fathers, as namely, Hierome, Ruffinus, Epiphanius, Athanaſius, Euſebius, and (to omit others,) S. Gregory did not acknowledge theſe bookes of Maccabees for Canonicall Scriptures; and conſequently, not to be of authoritie ſufficient to patronize any doctrine of faith. And now we come to ſalute their Rabbines.

                  6 Wherefore conſidering that theſe, whom the Apologiſts call ancient, and old Rabbines, were condemned by Chriſt, and accounted, in reſpect of the true and orthodoxall Rabbines among the Iewes of that time, but Yong; we cannot be otherwiſe perſwaded, but that the Apologiſts intended to deceiue their Readers with their old Rabbines, as ſometime the Ioſh. 9.

                      Bellarmine to be eſteemed of the Church as profitable to confute the Iewes, but not of ſo great authoritie among Chriſtians, as to make any ſound argument, becauſe of the Thalmudicall fouleneſſe wherwith they are defiled. Then thrice vainely hath Galatinus, and out of him their Coccius, and the Apologiſts from them both, endeuored to draw out of theſe puddles a Demonſtration, that is, an inuincible argument for confirmation of the Romiſh faith againſt Proteſtants. Which vanitie appeareth yet ſo much more vaine, becauſe, as their Ieſuite Rabbini Hebraeorum, qui vel diuinam Scripturam expoſuerunt, vel paraphraſes eidem adhibuerunt, vel in Thalmud plaeraque congeſſerunt, à Patribus vix vnquam citantur. Poſſeuinus Apparat. ſacr. part. 2. Tit. Rabbini.

Now that we haue broken this impoſtume of their ſwelling Demonſtration, we anſwer vnto the Prayer then vſed for the dead.
                  8 Symeon Ben Iohai bewrayeth himſelfe by the title of the booke, which is, Reuelatio ſecretorum. Apolog. pag. 25. lit. f. 
                     A Reuelation of Secrets. For if the practiſe of praying for the dead had bene alwayes ſo generall, then was it no ſecret; if it needed a new Reuelation, then was it not before his time generall or Catholike. And finally we appeale from Rabbi Symeon, Rabbi Kimki, Rabbi Haſcana, vnto Moſes in his Pentateuch, and the true Prophets of God; and knowing, that this Article of prayer for the dead is not reuealed in ſuch Scriptures, it may be iudged no better then a doctrine Thalmudicall.
                  9 And laſtly, why ſhall our Aduerſaries denie vs that libertie of renouncing the Iewiſh Doctors, (where they reiect the truth of Scripture,) which they do aſſume vnto themſelues? as when Cardinall Bellarmine accounteth it a Iewiſh fondneſſe to thinke, that Rabbi Salomon in cap. 9. Gen. vult eſſe reum homicidij, qui non dat operam liberis: & R. Dauid Kimchi in cap. 58. Eſa. ait, eſſe ſententiam Iudaeorum, eos qui non relinquunt filium, eſſe tanquam excommunicatos à Deo. Bellar. lib. 2. de Monachis, cap. 6. 
                     he ſhould be a murtherer, who did not apply himſelfe vnto the procreation of children, although Rabbi Salomon taught thus much: or to contemne the doctrine which ſaith, that he is an excommunicate from God, who leaueth not a male-child to ſucceed him after his death; albeit this opinion be by Rabbi Dauid Kimchi attributed vnto the ancient Iewes.

                  In the Prologue of the booke of Eccleſiaſticus, ante med. had giuen himſelfe to the reading of the law and Prophets and other bookes of their Fathers, and had gotten therein ſufficient knowledge.

                     not Canonicall. Notwithſtanding if they ſhall furthermore ſuppoſe, that euerie one who ſhould beare witneſſe vnto himſelfe, that he had giuen himſelfe to the reading of the law and the Prophets, and of their Fathers, had gotten therein ſufficient knowledge, could confirme any Article of doctrine: then might euerie Cabaliſticall and Thalmudicall Rabbin be equalled with Eccleſiaſticus. But firſt to the matter, and then to the Author.

                        Eccleſiaſticus 24. 37. I will pierce through the lower parts of the earth, I will looke vpon all ſuch as be aſleepe, and will lighten all them that truſt in the Lord: a ſaying ſo direct 
                        This piercing through the lower parts of the earth, to lighten thoſe that were there aſleep, and truſted in the Lord, argueth plainly that thoſe faithfull ſo aſleepe (or dead) were not then in heauen: for by the lower parts of the earth, cannot be meant heauen. 
                        and pertinent, that M. WHITAKER ſeeketh to euade by theſe two onely waies, as firſt in anſwering, that 
                        Whitaker contra Dureum, l. 8. pag. 567. poſt med. theſe words are wanting in the Greeke copies: Secondly (this being notoriouſly falſe,) &c.

                  2 M. Whitaker hath ſaid, The words obiected, [as out of Ecleſ. 24. 37. I will pierce] are not in the Greek. His anſwere (ſay the Apologiſts is notoriouſly falſe. Which notwithſtanding is ſo manifeſtly true, that not onely the

                     are not in the Greeke text. Which peraduenture was the cauſe that their Coccius, when he laboured to prooue this point from 
                        Coccius Tom. 1. lib. 2. art. 7. Aſſerunt ſacrae Scripturae, &c. 
                     Scriptures, pretermitted this Text, as in that reſpect impertinent. Therfore the falſification vſed by the Romiſh Apologiſts is more notorious, in that they themſelues then falſifie, euen in their accuſing their Aduerſarie of notorious falſhood.
                  
                  3 Notwithſtanding in the marginall note they pretend a reaſon of their taxation, taken from the Engliſh tranſlation of the Bible: but ſo, as that thereby their deluſion becometh more groſſe, as the places 
                        The Engliſh Bible alledged by the Apologiſts (which is commonly called the Geneua Bible) in the title of the firſt page, ſaith: The Bible, that is, The Scriptures contained in the old and new Teſtament, tranſlated according vnto the Hebrew and Greeke, doth meane onely the bookes Canonicall, which Proteſtants call

                      obiected do ſhew. Finally, if that they had not intended rather to blindfold their Reader then enlighten their own iudgement, why did they not ſpecifie any one Greeke copie which had thoſe words? Is not this a profound negligence to examine

what are the words of the Greeke text by the Engliſh, and not by the Greeke? If they (which is not probable) were ignorant of Greeke, yet might they haue vſed the ſpectacles of other mens learning, and not ſo raſhly haue condemned ſo excellently learned a Doctor of notorious falſhood, in his ſo faithfull and conſpicuous an anſwer.

For the Apoſtles words, ſaying of the Patriarks of the old Teſtament, that they had not receiued the promiſes, that they (namely the Iewes,) without vs, (viz. Chriſtians) ſhould not be made perfect, do not ſignifie (as the Apologiſts pretend) that their ſoules expected an entrance into heauē at Chriſts coming, leſt that they might haue bene perfected before Chriſtians: but they betoken the full perfection of both bodie and ſoule, which ſhall be accompliſhed in the day of reſurrection, as Cardinall Tertiò dico per repromiſſi onem intelligi perfectam beatitudinem corporis & animae, quam illi adhuc non habuerunt, ne ſine nobis habeant. Quae quidem eſt com munis Patrum expoſitio in cū locum: & Auguſtini, tract. 49. in Ioh.

Bellarm. lib. 1. de Beat. Sanct. cap. 3. §. Tertiò dico. Bellarmine in his laſt reſolution hath confeſſed, induced thereunto by (as he calleth it) the common expoſition of ancient Fathers, and alſo from the ſtrength of the text; wherein S. Auguſtine will haue vs to obſerue that it is ſaid, Leſt that they (Patriarks) without vs (Chriſtians) ſhould not be conſummated: He ſaith not (ſaith S. Auguſtine,) leſt that without vs they ſhould not be rewarded. So then they may by this text as well proue a Limbus of Chriſtian Apoſtles, as of Iewiſh Patriarks.

The Apologiſts (we confeſſe) wanted no art, when they left out theſe words, [as ignorant of the grace of God:] whereby he meant not altogether to take exception vnto free-will, but onely vnto ſuch a kind of naturall freedome in electing of good, which is void & deſtitute of the helpe of effectuall grace.

Firſt, Tentationes quae adueniunt, non ſunt fortuitae, nec Satanae voluntate permotae ſine permiſſione Dei; milites à Iuda inſtructi, permiſſione Patris filium comprehenderunt; diabolus exercet tyrannidem in mundo permiſſione Dei: Iudaeos non potuiſſe Dominum morti tradere, niſi Deus permiſiſſet. Caluinus com. in Matth. cap. 4. 8. & 26. 27. 
                     all temptations (ſaith M. Caluin) are by permiſsion of God, and by Gods permiſsion it is, that the diuell exerciſeth his tyrannie amongst men. Againe, Laudo veterum modeſtiam, quòd caecitatem & obſtinationem improborum ad ſolam permiſſionem diuinam, non ad operationem retulerunt, vt nullam occaſionem relinquerent de operibus Dei malè ſentiendi. Idem Inſtitut. cap. 4. §. 3. Non reijcimus vocem permiſſionis & conceſſionis, & nunquam nobis in mentem venit dicere, Deum operari (meaning ſinne) in impijs. Beza Aphoriſ. 29. 
                     I commend (ſaith he) the modeſtie of ancient Fathers, that they attributed the act of obduration of the wicked onely vnto Gods permiſsion, rather then to giue an occaſion vnto men ſiniſterly
                     
                     to conceit, that God is the authour of ſinne. Which though M. Calum 
                     c. Aug. lib. 5. con. Pelag. cap. 3. doth religiouſly abhorre: yet notwithſtanding he proceedeth further then a permiſſion, but vnder the conduct of S. Auguſtine (or rather of the Spirit of God in Scripture,) ſaying, that ſinnes are not onely acts of Gods patience, but alſo of his power, thereby puniſhing ſinne by a manner inexplicable, whereby he is ineffably iuſt.
                  
                  2 This doctrine ſeemeth to our Aduerſaries to be immodeſt and impious, when it paſſeth from Caluins quill, which being deliuered by their owne Ieſuits would peraduenture deſerue their approbation. Thus then Pererius and Suarez, two learned Ieſuits: Deus facit multa intra cum hominem, qui obduratur, quibus, vitio ſuo as fit deterior. Excitat in eo varios affectus, vel motus ſpei, fiduciae, cupiditatis, vel

                     God worketh many things in him that is hardned, whereby the wicked man is made worſe by his owne fault, not onely (as ſaith S. Auguſtine) by permitting, but by a certaine power, and (as it were) action, through his ſecret, but yet moſt iuſt and wiſe prouidence.
                  
                  3 The doctrine of Caluin and other Proteſtants, being ſo conſonant to the due acknowledgement of their owne Ieſuits, we wonder with what minds the Apologiſts do caſt their Reader this baite of Induration, except it be to intitle Caluin and his brethren vnto that hereſie, which maketh God to be the author of ſinne, as many Deum eſſe cauſam peccati docet Caluinus.

                     God worketh onely as a cauſe naturall, not as a cauſe morall. Which their Vegas hath well illuſtrated by a ſimilitude: Quem

                     When an expert ſcribe (ſaith he) writing with an euill pen doth make a blot, this blot is not to be imputed vnto the vnskilfulneſſe of the ſcribe, but to the naughtineſſe of the pen: and yet wil the ſcribe be offended with the pen, and ſometime in anger throw it into the fire.

                  THE PROTESTANTS APPEALE.
                  SECT. 1.
                  
                     BOldneſſe hath ſaid, that M. Whitaker did therefore not regard the example of Raphael, becauſe the place was ſo plaine for the patronage and interceſsion of Angels: whereas ſinceritie would haue acknowledged, that D. Whitaker ſaid plainly, Patrocinium quoddam Angelis minimè denegamus.—Sed aliud tu patrocinium Augelorum defendis, eoſue à nobis colendos & inuocandos eſſe ſtatuis: quod quidem Scriptura diſertiſſimè prohibet. Whittakerus reſp. ad Camp. rat. 1. pag. 17. 
                     We gainſay not all patronage of Angels, but that (ſpeaking vnto the Ieſuite Campian) which you defend, whereby you are drawne to inuocate them. And then ſhould they, in diſcretion, haue diſtinguiſhed between the patronage of tuition or miniſtration, & of interceſſion, whereby men are induced to performe vnto them the worſhip of Inuocation; whereof there is no ſyllable of proofe in the whole booke of Tobie. So that the iudgement of that learned Doctor was plainly this, to diſlike the doctrine of the inuocation of Angels, becauſe (his owne words) it is contrarie vnto Scripture; & alſo to reiect the authoritie of this booke, becauſe (as ſome Romaniſts confeſſe) 
                        See aboue cap. 1. neither the Iewes, See it plentifully proued hereafter in the laſt booke. nor yet the primitiue Chriſtian Churches did hold it Canonicall.

                        In like manner doth the booke of Macchabees make mention how Iudas Machabaeus

And Onias ſpake and ſaid, This is a louer of the brethren who praieth much for the people, and for the whole Citie, (to wit) Ieremias the Prophet of God: A place ſo direct for the interceſsion of Saints, that M.

                  SECT. 2.
                  3 It may not be called a contempt of this booke, if it be contemned in

reſpect of Canonicall Scripture, no more then it may be thought a diſgrace for a man to be abaſed, whē as he ſtandeth in compariſon with God. But what is the euidence of the place, that any Proteſtant ſhould therefore contemne it? The foundation of all is a viſion of Macchabaus in a dreame, wherein he ſeemed to ſee 2. Macchab. 15. 12. ver. 15. & 16. 
                     Ieremias the Prophet holding out his right hand, & giuing vnto Iudas a ſword of gold, and as he gaue it, he ſpake thus: Take this ſword a gift from God, wherewith thou ſhalt wound thy aduerſaries.
                  
                  4 What will our Aduerſaries ſay? haue the ſoules departed hands? did Ieremie truly giue vnto Iudas a golden ſword, which was but onely made of fanſie in a dreame? This teacheth vs that, viſions are not alwaies to be expounded literally, as things done, but as if they had bene done. And this was the comfort of this viſion which Macchabaeus was to cōceiue, namely, to think that God would bleſſe his battel takē in defence of his worſhip, euē as if thoſe holy men Onias and Ieremie had perſonally interceded in that behalfe, or as if he had ſent a golden ſword vnto the ſame Iudas Macchabaeus, as a pledge of his promiſed fauour and protection. Neither can our Aduerſaries from interceſsion of Saints for vs, make any good inference of 
                        See this proued aboue, lib. 2. our inuocation of them, which is the maine point, and which they endeuour to proue by a prettie fanſie following.

                        And it is to be obſerued further as verie probable, that the Iewes preſent at our Sauiours death, could not haue bene ſo eaſily perſwaded to think & ſay, that our Sauiour ſaying,

                  8 If they obiect the ſpeech, as proceeding from the opinion of the learned Iewes: then (that we may ſuppoſe this which their owne Doctors haue denied) theſe muſt haue ſpoken thoſe words either in earneſt, or in ſcorne: If we vnderſtand it to haue bene ſpoken in earneſt, (whereof notwithſtanding there is no proofe,) yet doth it not neceſſarily concerne the Inuocation of Saints departed, but of the liuing; becauſe ſome Iews held an opiniō (as their Viuere enim credebatur Elias, & apparere aliquando nonnullis. Arias Montanus in eum locum.
                      Arias Montanus obſerueth) that Elias yet liuing did ſometimes appeare vnto men: and ſo the argument is inſufficiēt, concluding an Inuocation of the dead from an Inuocation of a perſon liuing.
                  9 If laſtly it may be thought to haue bene ſpoken in ſcorne and contempt of Chriſt (as by the confeſſions of our See the teſtimonies already alledged. Aduerſaries, ſome Fathers haue affirmed,) then is their argument, being taken from mockery, apparently friuolous. And thus is their probable argument become by foure neceſſarie ſuppoſitions either heatheniſh, or childiſh, or impertinent, or ridiculous.
                  10 The next confirmation which they vſe out of the Rabbins, is a mixture of two errours: the firſt is the 
                        Flauius Ioſephus de bello Iudaico lib. 3. cap. 14. after the Greeke, cap. 25. And Ruſſinus expoundeth the Greeke word 
                              〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                            paſſiuely, audiuntur; tranſlating that place of Ioſephus.
                      tranſlation of the Greeke word 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      contrarie vnto the ſcope of the text: for Ioſephus diſſwading men from murthering themſelues for feare of danger, ſaith, that this is all one as if a man ſhould ſteale away his Lords pledge: but he that ſhall ſtay Gods call, is like him who payeth his rent at the time appointed. Of the former kind he ſaith, they are in the darkneſſe of hell, but pronounceth of the other, that they are pure ſoules, and 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , that is, attentiue, or obedient vnto God. Secondly they erre together with their conducter Coccius by miſconſtruction: for 
                        Ioſephus Ben-gorion de bello Iudaico, cap. 21. as it is cited by Coccius, whom theſe Apologiſts follow, though it be miſquoted, wherein onely as a Rhetoricall proſopopoeia: for therein he calleth vp Phinees, Surge nunc Phinees.—Transſige in furore tuo ſeditioſos: Tu Dauid Rex Domini, expergiſecre cum ſtrepitu Citherarum: and of Elias, Libera reliquias Iſrael, quemadmodum traxit caſtra ſyrorum. Ioſeph Ben-gorion that ſaith, Ariſe Moſes and behold thy people, riſe vp Aaron thou holy Prieſt of God, calleth alſo vpon Phinees to ariſe, and to pierce through the ſeditious in his wrath: and vpon Dauid, to awake, and come with the noiſe of his harpe. Which their learning could not but teach them to be rhetoricall proſoperies: ſuch as were the ſpeeches of Scriptures in calling vpō the Often in the Pſalmes. creatures of heauē
                      & earth, and contained in them a iuſtice of hearing and praiſing the Lord. But behold
               
               
                  
                  The Apologiſts argument for Inuocation, taken frō the doctrine of the ancient Iewes, confuted by the profeſsion of the truly ancient Iewes: from the confeſsion of our learned Aduerſaries.
                  SECT. 4.
                  11 What is it that the Apologiſts proue from theſe Iewiſh Rabbins? They haue ſaid, that it is a familiar and vſuall cuſtome of praying vnto Saints: as did likewiſe their Ieſuite Salmeron; not conſidering what their owne Romane Rabbins and Doctors (Cardinall Bellarmine, their Ieſuite Suarez, and others) haue alreadie Quòd aliquis directè orauerit ſanctos defunctos, vt ſe adiuuarent, vel pro ſe orarent, nuſquam legimus.

                      confeſſed, viz. that it was not vſuall among the Iewes, to pray vnto the ſoules of Patriarks, becauſe they were not in the ſtate of bleſſedneſſe, or able to know the praiers of the liuing: neither was it their manner to pray directly vnto them, as to ſay, Father Abraham pray for vs; but to inuocate in their names. Finally, that 
                        See aboue lib. 2. cap. 12. 
                     this was not taught vnto the people of the old Teſtamēt before Chriſt, for feare of Idolatrie; nor at their firſt conuerſion vnto the faith of Christ, becauſe the Iewes would haue thought it an hard thing to be inſtructed to pray vnto ſoules departed. So learned haue theſe Apologiſts bene in painted Sophiſtry, whereof they ſhall giue their Reader a further taſte in the Article following.

                     It is the opinion of the Iewes, that Moſes did receiue two lawes of God in Mount Sinai, the one written, & the other vnwritten; and this later to haue bene cōmended by word of mouth without writing by Moſes vnto Ioſhua; by him vnto the Elders of Iſrael; by them vnto the Prophets, and by them vnto the Maſters of the great Synagogue vnder Eſdras; from whom the wiſe men following did ſucceſſiuely receiue it. And this double manner of expoſition of the law, the Iewes at this day do glorie to be among them, which they call Cabala.
                  
                  
                     
4 What now hath our learned Fagius confeſſed? that the ancient Iewes do affirme the vnwritten law? So the Romiſh Apologiſts pretend: but he only relateth the opinion of the Iewes at this day, who do thinke that their Cabala or Reception of vnwritten Traditions was deriued by continuall ſucceſſion from Moſes vnto their Chachamin and late wizzards: which may be confirmed by the confeſſion of their owne Petrus Galatinus, their principall Doctor and conductor in this queſtion: for thus he; Neque vllam eius (viz Cabalae) particulam Scripturae mandari licebat. Vnde praeter ea quae à Rabbi Symeon filio Ioai tradita aſſeruntur, alia à veteribus ſcripta vel pauca, vel nulla comperiuntur.—Cabalam, quod receptio Latin
                           •
                         interpretatur, vocitarunt; Recentiorum autem Iudaeorum Doctores, ne patemum illud dogma euaneſceret, de huiuſmodi facultate aliquid ſcripto in lucem ediderunt, ſparſim tamen, ac nonnullis velaminibus obumbratum. Galatinus arcan. fid. lib. 1. cap. 6. Quocirca neque mirum eſt ſi nomen hoc Cabala, ſiue facultas eo nomine deſignata, rarò hucuſque in Sanctorum, caeterorumue ſapientum ore habita ſit, & ſi de ipſa veteres non noſtri meminerint, ex iunioribus tamen quidam linguam Hebraicam callentes—de ipſa multa ſcripſerunt. nam Iohannes quidem Picus primus de ea quaſi de longinquo, aliqua ſuſpicari coepit. Galatinus lib. 1. cap. 6. verſus finem.
                      
                     This Cabala, or receit (which might not lawfully be committed to writing) the later Iewiſh Doctors haue publiſhed in writing. Now do we approach to our triall, firſt ſhewing
               
               
                  That the Church of the Iewes, in, or after the daies of Moſes receiued no vnwritten Traditions from God: by the confeſsion of our learned Aduerſaries.
                  SECT. 4.

                     Some Catholicks (ſaith their Cardinall Bellarmine) haue denied that the Iewes had any vnwritten Traditions committed vnto them: and that this may be affirmed Catholikely, their Biſhop Ianſenius will warrant vs, who affirmeth, that Quòd vni Iudaeorum populo per Moſem diligenter ſatis perſcripta eſſent quaecunque ad religionem pertinerent, & iuſtitiam inter homines ſeruandam. Ianſenius Concird. Euang. cap. 120. in haec verba, Quaecunque dixerint, facite. 
                     Moſes deliuered vnto the people of the Iewes all thoſe things which concerned either religion towards God, or iuſtice towards men. Which might be eaſily euinced by anſwering the obiections which our Aduerſaries do vſually make: but ſeeing truth by ſhewing it ſelfe doth diſcouer the vntruth, therefore we proceed to make knowne,
               
               
                  That the Traditions profeſſed by the Iewes, now obiected, were humane figments, and condemned by Christ: proued by the confeſsion of our Romiſh Aduerſaries.

For their deſert is apparent, in that they, for proofe of many Romiſh Tradidions, do produce the teſtimonies not onely of the declining Iewes before Chriſt, but alſo of the apoſtate Iewes ſince Chriſt: concerning whom we proue,
               
               
                  
                     That the vnwritten Traditions, which the Iewes ſince Chriſt do profeſſe and protend to haue bene deliuered by Moſes, and ſo ſucceſsiuely from the Prieſts and Prophets of the old Teſtament vnto them, are vntruly auouched by them in maintenance both of their Thalmud, and Cabala: by the confeſsion of our Aduerſaries.

And of the Cabala he intimateth that the ancient Fathers did not acknowledge that Cabala, but the firſt whom he can find to haue regarded it, was Picus Earle of Mirandula: which is the iudgement of their Rabbi Symeō Caballicorum Princeps, cuius Cabala legaliū rerum arcana, ſpiritualem allegoricamue intelligentiam continens, Patrum tantùm temporibus per Mirandulanum Principem in lucem exijt.

               CHAP. IX. Of the the Merit of good works.
               
               THE ROMISH APOLOGIE.
               7 Seuenthly, concerning the force or merite of Almes, and other good works, proceeding from true faith in the Meſsias, the doctrine of the ancient Iewes is diliuered in the booke of Tobie, where it is ſaid: 
                  Toby 12. 9. after the tranſlation of the Engliſh Bible of 1576. and according to the Greeke copie publiſhed by the diuines of Baſil 1550. the which I do more preciſely note, for that M. Fulke againſt the Rhemiſh Teſtament. fol. 109. a. circa med. denieth the latter part of this text to be in the Greeke. Almes doth deliuer from death, and doth purge all ſinne: and againe, 
                  Toby 4. 10. Almes doth deliuer from death, and ſuffereth not (the ſoule) to go into darkneſſe: and in the foreſaid booke of Eccleſiaſticus, 
                  Eccleſiaſticus 3. 33. Water quencheth burning fire, and almes expiateth (or purgeth) ſinne. And this is but agreeable with the other Scriptures acknowledged for Canonicall, as where it is ſaid, 
                  Daniel 4. 24. Whereas our aduerſaries do here in ſtead of redeeme, tranſlate, breake off: Hemingius in his expoſition of the 84. Pſal. Engliſhed, pag. 527. thinketh that the Hebrew word ſignifieth to redeeme: ſo alſo moſt cleerly in the Greeke tranſlation doth the Greeke word, and ſo likewiſe doth the vulgar interpreter, and the ancient Fathers reade accordingly, inſomuch as the ſame reading is obſerued likewiſe by Luther in loc, commun. claſſ. 1. pag. 72. ante medium: and by Peter Martyr in his Common places in Engliſh, part 3. cap. 4. pag. 114. b. circa med. by Mecancthon in loc. cōmun. edit. 1536. cap. de bonis operibus, pag. 157. in fine▪ by the Apologie of the confeſſion of Auguſta, fol 104. a. circa med. And by the Tigurine tranſlation of 1544. whereunto may be added the like reading and iudgement of Caluine, Aretius, Bullenger, and many other Proteſtants. Redeeme thy ſins with almes, and thy iniquities with mercy to the poore: Prouerb. 16. 6. By mercy and truth ſinne ſhall be forgiuen: Prouerb. 15. 27. although this be omitted in the Engliſh Bible of 1576. yet is it ſo euidently parcell of the text, that (to omit the Fathers) the Diuines of Baſil in their edition hereof in the Greeke and Latin, printed 1550. do reade it accordingly. By almes and faith ſinnes are purged: Luc. 11. 41. Giue almes, and behold all things are cleane to you.
               
                  THE PROTESTANTS APPEALE: Satisfying for the ſence of Scriptures.
                  
                  SECT. 1.
                  THey haue produced many Scriptures, but as though the place of Daniel were a promontorie among the reſt, here they pitch a marginal note vpō
                     
the word [Redime, that is, Redeeme,] taxing the Proteſtants tranſlation, which is [Abrumpe, that is, Break off] thy ſins, &c. Not but that the 
                        Amandus Polanus a Proteſtant vpon the place of Daniel. See M. Caluin vpon Dan. 4. and Peter Martyr in his Common places.
                      original is, Break off, of the ſame root whence Exo. 32. ver. 2. the Iſraelites are willed to Break off their earings: but they only contēd to ſhew, that many Proteſtāts do acknowledge alſo their vulgar reading of Redeeme, and for confirmation hereof, haue cited Luther and eight other witneſſes to appeare. Which onely ſheweth that thoſe Proteſtants would be (as we may ſo ſay) rather Reals then Nominals, not ſo much labouring vpon the word, as vpon the ſence of Scripture, which in both tranſlations is the ſame. For as the Scripture phraſe of redeeming the time is a breaking off the line of former ſinnes, and a beginning to ſpinne a new threed of godlineſſe vnto the end of our life: ſo may it be vnderſtood here, where Nabuchadonozer an oppreſſor of his ſubiects by iniuſt ſpoile of other mens goods, now in iustice (for ſo the word in the originall is 
                        Pintus vpon Dan. 4. confeſſed to ſignifie) he is to make ſatisfaction vnto man, before he can expect the fauour of God.
                  2 Their Romiſh tranſlators in their Annotations vpon the text of Luc. 11. do muſter all the obiected Scriptures, with no ſmall oſtentation, ſaying, 
                        Rhemiſts annot. vpon Luc. 11 41. citing theſe Scriptures, Eccl. 3. 33. Dan. 4. 24. Tob. 4. 12. 11. 9. Matth. 25. 35. 42. 
                     The great force of Almes in diuerſe places of holy Scripture is ſignified; in one place they extingiſh ſinne, in another they redeeme ſinnes, in another they deliuer from death: and in this place they make cleane and ſatisfie for the Iewes former offences. Now how will Proteſtants (ſay they) like this doctrine ſo euidently ſet forth in Scripture, let the indifferent Reader iudge, and how well it agreeth with their only faith? We will ſhew how Proteſtants may like it, and ſo referre the caſe vnto the iudgement of the Reader.
                  3 Firſt in theſe places which haue bene obiected, there is onely mention made of Almes: can the Romaniſts ſay, that Almes alone haue this force of redeeming of ſinne? If they ſhould, then might they be readily confuted by their owne Ieſuite Maldonate, ſhewing from S. Auguſtine, that Quid enim? an ſi eleemoſynam dediſſent; in ipſum verò qui ſalutis vnicus author eſt, non credidiſſent, mundi, id eſt, iuſti fuiſſent? quis hoc dicat? Tractauit hunc locum copioſè Auguſtin. lib. 1. de verbis Dom. ſecundum Lucā & ſerm. 30. & in Enchiridio dicit; qui ſceleratiſſimè viuunt,—& eleemoſynas frequentant, fruſtrà ſibi in co blandiri, quoniam Chriſtus dixit, Date eleemoſynam.—Idem Auguſtinus, ſicut Beda & Strabus eleemoſynam pro omni ſpecie miſericordiae & charitatis exponunt, cuius prima pars eſt vt noſtri miſereamur, iuxta illud Eccleſ. 30. 24. Miſerere animae t

                     no man will ſay, that giuing of Almes can auaile for purgation of ſinne without faith in him, (Chriſt) who is the onely author of ſaluation: and this doctrine the Proteſtants (they know) do not diſlike.
                  4 Secondly the queſtion is, how then can Almes be ſaid to purge ſinne? Whereunto their foreſaid Ieſuite anſwereth, that Sed adhuc qu
                           •

                        . 41. he addeth, that Proteſtants cannot abide this expoſition, and then inferreth the texts aboue cited and obiected. But this expoſition is that which we may eaſily admit in his true ſence: for God diſpoſeth man vnto faith and charitie, and then is man diſpoſed and qualified to receiue remiſſion.
                      
                     it is impoſsible for Almes to cleanſe the ſoule from ſinne, but to diſpoſe it.

And in this ſence the Proteſtants will like better of phraſes of Scripture then can their Aduerſaries: for if euen the beſt actions of Chriſtians haue need of a redemption by the vertue of the bloud of Chriſt, then not Almes but Chriſts ſatisfaction onely is of it ſelfe of a purgatorie and meritorious vertue.

                  8 Againe, the article now in queſtion is propounded by the Apologiſts to be concerning the force or merit of Almes, and we ſee many texts produced to proue a force of Almes, but not one wherein there is any mention of Merit: which we might thinke was done vpon an exigence, but that their Rhemiſts tranſlating according vnto the vulgar Latine, that place of Heb. 13. 16. will haue it read thus: Beneficence and communication do not forget, for with ſuch hoſts God is promerited. Whereunto their Lindanus hath pointed with his marginall finger, ſaying, Meriti vox in Scripturis tribuitur bonis operibus. Lindanus Panopl. lib. 3. cap. 20. in margine.
                      
                     Behold the word Merit in Scriptures: notwithſtanding the greeke word (which is the originall) properly ſignifieth (as Bellarmine witneſſeth) Verbum Graecum ſignificat propriè, Delectatur Deus: aut, vt Eraſmus vertit, Placet Deo. Bellarm. lib. 2. de verbo Dei▪ cap. 14. §. Decimus. 
                     God is delighted; or as Eraſmus doth render it, God is well pleaſed:

                     better then the Latine vulgar word of promerited. Now God, we know, is pleaſed with his owne works; he reuiewed them, and

                     There is a Merit of condignitie, whereunto a reward is due from God in iuſtice, euen for the worthineſſe of the worke; the other is called a Merit of congruitie, whereunto a reward is due though not in iuſtice, yet by grace and acceptance. We haue throughly diſcuſſed the former member of Merit de condigno: now are we to examine the ſecond, which is de congruo.

                     ontrarie acts of iuſtice: from whom they would proue, that he had power meritoriouſly to redeeme his ſinnes by almes. The ſecond is from the Phariſees, who (as may appeare by Chriſts often denunciations of woe againſt them) were farre wo-begon and deſtitute of grace: who notwithſtanding (as the Apologiſts ſuppoſe) were able by almes meritoriouſly to make them ſelues cleane.
                  
                  11 But leſt they may thinke that we deale too violently with them, eſpecially

in this firſt reſpect of that merit in the ſtate of men wholy forlorne of grace: we enter vpon the ſecond conſideration of their merit de congruo, as it is expreſſed by their Ieſuite Pererius: Patres Conc. Trid. intelligendi ſunt de Merito propriè dicto, quod eſt de condigno: Nam ſi loquamur de Merito amplè ſumpto, & vt nunc appellatur Meritum de Congruo, non videtur eſſe negandum per fidem & alia opera praeparatoria promereri aliquo modo iuſtificationis gratiam, hoc enim frequenter repetire licet apud Patres, dicere ſolitos, peccatorem per lachrymas—eleemoſynas, caeteraue opera miſericordiae promereri veniam & remiſſ. peccatorum. Pererius Ieſ. in Rom. cap 3. diſp. 17. num 85. 
                     If we ſpeake (ſaith he) of the merit of congruitie, it may ſeeme to be a matter not to be denied, that a man by the act of faith, almes, and teares, and other ſuch like works of preparation, doth merit and deſerue the grace of remiſsion of ſinne. Which (ſaith Cardinall Si de ſecundogenere operum loquatur (Kemnitius)—vix enim eſt vllus inter veteres, qui non agnoſcat meritum aliquod in operibus poenitentiae, quae per Dei gratiam fiunt.

                     not merits) in any man for obtaining remiſsion and purgation of ſinnes: becauſe they are ſo farre from redeeming or purging mens ſinnes by their owne force, that by reaſon of their corruptions they themſelues haue need of purgation in Christs bloud. We haue heard the Apologiſts promiſing to giue a demonſtration of the particulars of their faith from the teſtimonies of the Iewiſh Rabbins, and yet herein do obiect §. 2. none.

                  2 Cardinall Bellarmine profeſſeth, that Multa tribuuntur Eſſaenis à Ioſepho, quae manifeſtè erronea, & ſuperſtitioſa ſunt, quorum nihil tribuit Philo ſuis Therapeutis. Bellarm. lib. 2. de Monach. cap. 5. §. Reſpondeo duas. 
                     many things are attributed by Ioſephus vnto theſe Eſſaei, which are manifeſtly erroneous and ſuperſtitious. The Biſhop Stratonicus Cumarum Epiſcopus, in Collectaneis ſuis autumat haſce Traditiones fuiſſe (ſpeaking of ſuch as Chriſt condemned) Placita & Decreta Iudaicarum ſectarum: quatuor enim, vt Ioſephus & Epiphanius ſcribunt, apud Iudaeos fuerunt viuendi inſtituta, quorum vnum profitebantur Phariſaei, alterum Galilaei, tertium Sadducaei, quartum Eſſaeni. Sixtus Senenſis Biblioth. lib. 2. Tit. Traditiones, pag. 123. Stratonicus collecteth, that theſe Eſſaei were addicted vnto ſome of thoſe Traditions, which were condemned by Chriſt vnder the name of Traditions of men: for at the time of our Sauiours preaching, the Iewes (as he proueth out of Ioſephus and Epiphanius) were diuided into ſoure ſects, viz. Phariſees,
                     
                     Galilaeans, Sadduces, and Eſſaeans. And as the Phariſaei, (de quibus ſic Epiphanius) virginitati ſtudebant, &c.—ſic dicebantur, eò quòd ſeparati eſſent ab alijs propter ſpontaneam & ſuperſtuam religionem apud ipſos receptam: Phares enim Hebraicâ linguâ ſeparationem ſignificat.

                  4 Doctor Raynolds ſaid, that 
                        In his Conference, pag. 488. 
                     Philo writeth not of Chriſtian Monks, but of Iewiſh Eſſees: and we know that he would not ſpeake without booke; which we are induced rather to beleeue, becauſe the Romaniſts are in controuerſie among themſelues, whether Ioſephus & Philo do both write of the ſame Eſſaei: ſome ſay, that they both deſcribed Alij docenttam Philonem quàm Ioſephū de Chriſtianis loqui: quibus fauere videtur B. Hieronymus, quam ſententiā tuetur Galenus. Bellarm. lib. 2. de Monach. cap. 5. §. Alij docent. 
                     Chriſtian Eſſaei; ſome Quidam aſſerunt non loqui de ijſdem Ioſephum, & Philonem, nam Ioſephus, lib. 18. Antiq. cap. 2. aſſerit Eſſaenorum ſectam antiquam apud Iudaeos fuiſſe. Bellarmin. ibidem, paulò antè.
                      
                     denie it, becauſe Ioſephus ſaith, that the firſt of theſe Eſſaei was ancient among the Iewes. So that they who thinke that Philo did deſcribe the ſame Eſſaei, muſt neceſſarily hold them to haue bene Iewiſh.

Baronius cannot denie but that it was the intent of Philo in his deſcription of the Eſſaei, to commend the orders which were then vſed among the Iewes: how then ſhould not D. Reynolds and the Centuriſts, following onely Philo, iudge the obiected Eſſaeans to haue bene fully Iewiſh? Finally the Eſſaei ſpoken of by the Fathers, might poſſibly haue bene ſome of that order, who had bene conuerted vnto Chriſtianitie, and in the time of perſecution continued their ſequeſtration in the deſerts, as well as others, whom their Hoc tempore multi Eremum colebant metu perſecutionum. Genebrard. anno 139. pag. 381. Genebrard noteth to haue taken that courſe. In which ſence the Apologiſts obiection, taken from the faith of ancient Iewes (as they feine,) is no way Iewiſh, but Chriſtian, and conſequently impertinent.

Vow yee, and render your vowes vnto God: (2) Whoſoeuer voweth a vow vnto the Lord, &c. he ſhall not breake his promiſe, but ſhall do according to all which proceedeth (3) Num. 30. 3. from his mouth. Deut. 23. 21. When thou ſhalt vow vnto the Lord thy God, thou ſhalt not be ſlacke to pay it, for the Lord thy God will ſurely require it of thee. Eccleſiaſtes 5. 3. When thou haſt vowed a vow vnto God, deferre not to pay it: &c. It is better that thou ſhouldeſt not vow, then that thou ſhouldeſt vow and not pay it. Whereunto might be added ſundrie other 
                     Pſal. 22. 25. & Pſal. 50. 14. & Eſay 19. 21.

                              . And M. Fulke anſwering to Pſal. 76. 11. ſaith, That text pertaineth to the old Teſtament, in his Retentiue againſt Briſtowes Motiues, &c. pag. 153. fine. And Bullinger in his Decades in Engliſh, pag. 380. ante med. ſaith, Vowes belong to the Iewiſh ceremonies.
                         Vowes were ceremonies of the old Teſtament, &c. aboliſhed by Chriſts coming. But is not the contrarie many waies euident? as 1. Firſt in that vowes were made before Moſes time, as is to be ſeene in the example of 
                        Gen. 28. 20. Then Iacob vowed a vow, ſaying, &c.

                     a matter not commanded by God, but in it ſelfe indifferent; becauſe it were folly and iniquitie to condition with God about that which he hath commanded to be done: but their Ieſuite Azorius proueth from the ſame text, that man may bind himſelfe to God, for performance of that which God hath bound him to diſcharge. As when in matrimonie one promiſeth chaſtitie, which afterward he doth violate, Nihil impedit quo minus quis ſe denuò voti religione obſtringat, ad quod alioqui faciendum lege & praecepto compellitur.—Deus enim nos ſibi ſuis legibus deuinxit, & nos ipſos ei pariter voti nexu vinculoue obligamus; vt Iacob Gen. 28. vouit Domino, ſe eum vt Deum veneraturum: vnde qui caſtitatem Deo promiſſam adulterio violat, eſt & diuinae legis violatae, & voti facti reus.

                     he thereby becometh guiltie both of the breach of his owne vow, and of the tranſgreſsion of Gods law. Of this kind is the vow of euerie man in baptiſme, to forſake the Diuell; which vow no Chriſtian will contemne. We come to the vſe.

                     the libertie of vowing is not aboliſhed by the Goſpell, if vowes be vndertaken to a right end. M. Luther, and M. Caluin (as Cardinall Bellarmine witneſſeth) Lutheri & Caluini ſententia eadem eſſe videtur, vterque enim tria quaedam de votis docet, 1. ad colendum Deum non niſi de rebus praeceptis fieri:—ad vitanda peccata, & aliosbonos fines poſſe fieri de rebus non praeceptis. Bellar. lib. 2. de Monach. cap. 15. 
                     conſent both in one opinion, to think that vowes which belong to Gods worſhip, must be in things which are commanded by God: and vowes which make for our better auoidance of ſin, may be vſed in things which are not commanded. M. Fulke did indeed denie Ananias to haue vowed, yet did he aknowledge the lawfulneſſe of 
                        Againſt Briſtowes Motiues, pag 153. 
                     vowes as well as any Proteſtant, notwithſtanding he cenſureth the arguments vſed by Romaniſts for proofe of their monkerie, to be but ill-fauouredly patched together; becauſe they are ſuperſtitious for want of Gods commandement, blaſphemous for the opinion of merit, impoſsible for the frailtie of mans nature. The onely difference in the obiected Authors is in the diuerſe expoſition of ſome Scriptures.
                  4 The firſt place is from the example of Ananias and others, who in the 
                        Act. 2 45. 4. 32. Acts ſold their poſſeſſions, and laid them at the Apoſtles feete, with whom all things were made common. Albeit their Ieſuite Lorinus doubteth not to affirme, that all thoſe Chriſtians did profeſſe alſo Caelibem agebant vitam quotquot per votum ſ

Act. 5.] Hinc clarè apparet, quòd non voti neceſſitate Chriſtiani omnes omnia tunc habebant communia, ſed libera perfectione charitatis. Idem com. in Act. cap. 5. Caietan doth giue vs to vnderſtand from the ſame Scripture (as being a matter apparent,) that then all Christians had all things common, not by neceſsitie of vowes, but by free perfection of charitie, ſupplying vnto euerie one according as euerie man had need.
                  5 But that we may grant thoſe Chriſtians by vow to haue relinquiſhed the propertie and dominion which they had in thoſe poſſeſsions, and to haue yeelded them (as they did) vnto the common vſe of the Saints; yet was the occaſion hereof extraordinary, and proper for that time, whileſt Act. 2. 45.] Poſſeſſiones & ſubſtantias vendebant, & diuidebant illa omnibus, prout cuique opus erat.] Singularis Dei prouidentia fuit, vt propter mox futuram perſecutionem diſpergendis ſuppeteret, vtcunque ex diſtractis poſſeſſionibus & ſubſtantijs vnde viuerent, atque fa

                     by the ſingular prouidence of God, (as faith their Ieſuite Lorinus) fore-ſeeing the perſecution of Chriſtians now at hand, they thus prepared for the reliefe of the Saints. And we know that to cōclude a perpetuall doctrine from a practiſe extraordinary, can be no better then not only (as our learned Doctor hath called it it) a patched, but alſo a preiudiciall conſequence. For theſe fore-named Chriſtians ſold their poſſeſsions, & brought the price of them into the publike communion: but the Monaſticall Orders, & the whole Eccleſiaſticall maintenance ariſeth from a paying of ſome price of money, and purchaſe of poſſeſſions: inſomuch that (as their Ieſuite confeſſeth) the difference of the after-Church from the Apoſtolike of that time, is no leſſe then betweene Quòd futuram Eccleſiam in Gentibus praeuidebant Apoſtoli, idcirco praedia in Iudaea minimè ſunt adepti, ſed pretia tantuminodò.—At verò cùm ſuccreſceret Eccleſia—praedia habere ipſi licuit.

                     THe hinge of this queſtion is not (as hath bene 
                        See aboue lib. 2. cap. 14. Sect. 1. confeſſed) concerning Confeſsion of ſinnes in generall vnto a Miniſter, but of particular ſinnes: neither whether we may, but whether we ought neceſſarily purpoſe a manifestation of euerie knowne mortall ſinne, and the grieuous circumstances thereof; or must otherwiſe ſtand hopeleſſe of all remiſsion of our ſins. And now are we ſent vnto the Iewiſh Schoole to learne this point of Romiſh Confeſſion, and that by the direction of their Galatinus. He will haue vs to obſerue the example of 
                        Ioſh. 7. 
                     Achan, who after he had priuily ſtolne the Anathema and curſed gold, was found out (God ſo ordaining) by lot, and commanded by Ioſhua (who was appointed by God the Captaine ouer the campe of Iſrael) to confeſſe his ſinne, and to giue the glory vnto God: whereupon the Iewiſh Sanhedrin commenting, ſaith: He that confeſſeth ſhall haue part in the life to come.
                  
                  2 This is the Baſe: now marke their deſcant: they ſhould proue a priuate and auricular Confeſſion, but obiect a publike, euen before all Iſrael; they alledge a ciuil Confeſſion exacted of a Magiſtrate, that God may be glorified in the truth of the ſentence of death, which had bene paſſed vpon the malefactor, when as they ſhould proue a ſacramentall Confeſſion to a Prieſt. So harſh is this ſtraine which Galatinus, and after him

                      Coccius, and now their Apologiſts do play in print.
                  3 So do they alſo erre vpon the next ſtring, which is the ſentence of Rabbi Huma, whom they miſ-terme Hurma: He ſaith, that it is neceſſarie for euerie one who tranſgreſſeth, that he do particularly confeſſe his ſinne. True, but whether be meant that euerie man particularly muſt confeſſe euerie knowne ſin, or whether that ſingle Rabbin meant a confeſſion to be made vnto man, or vnto God, it doth not directly appeare▪ But it is no incongruitie that their

author Galatinus (according to the cenſure of their owne Senenſis) 
                        See hereafter cap. 14. §. 2. 
                     a vaine author, ſhould abuſe the names of Rabbins for the colouring of a vaine concluſion. It may be the Apologiſts will be more exact in their next argument.

                        And like further teſtimonie or prefiguration therof is not wanting in Leuiticus; for whereas ſeuerall ſacrifices are there appointed for ſeuerall ſinnes, as for 
                        Leuit. 4. 2, 3. &c. ſinne through ignorance, and other

For their owne Lyranus, who had bene ſometime a Iew, feared not to confeſſe, that

And M. Willet in his Sinopſis, pag. 478. ante med. & verſus finem, affirmeth the like. And M. Whittaker in his anſwer to M. Rainolds, &c. pag. 67. ſaith, Melchiſedech did not by any thing wherein he ſo ſacrificed, prefigure the ſacrifice and prieſthood of Chriſt.

                  Rabbi Samuel in Bereſchit Rabba ad cap. 14. Gen. Melchiſedech ſet forth the acts of Prieſthood,

for he ſacrificed bread and wine to the holy and bleſſed God. Rabbi Phinees ſaith, 
                  Rabbi Phinees ibidem in cap. 28. Numer. In the time of the Meſſias all ſacrifices ſhall ceaſſe &c. as it is ſaid, Pſal. 110. Thou art a Prieſt for euer according to the order of Melchiſedech. Rabbi Moſes Hadarſan ſaith of Melchiſedech,

                  THE PROTESTANTS APPEALE: Shewing the notable ſleight vſed by the Apologiſts in their falſe allegations of the Iewiſh Rabbins.
                  
                  SECT. 1.
                  
                     TWo things come to be diſputed in this obiection: the firſt is the truth of the ſence of Scripture, [Melchizedech brought forth bread & wine, &c.] whether Melchiſedech in the vſe of that Bread and Wine performed an office of his Prieſthood, or no; the ſecond is the conſequence, which our Aduerſaries inferre thereupon, as namely, a Sacrifice properly propitiatorie.
                  2 Concerning the ſence of the ſtory, we are challenged to conſult with the Iewiſh Rabbins, for my diſcharge both in this of Sacrifice, and in the next queſtion of Tranſubſtantiation: vnto which I could not finde that due ſatisfaction from the confeſſion of our Aduerſaries, which in other queſtions I had done. I therefore held it requiſite to deſire the helpe of our learned D. Smith, D. Layfield, M. Bedwell. Doctors, who are moſt expert in the knowledge of the Hebrew: vnto whom I laid open the Apologiſts allegation of Rabbi Samuel in Bereſhith Rabba, of Rabbi Phinees ibid. of Rabbi Moſes Hadarſan ibid. They (after they had peruſed the Bereſhith Rabba) anſwered, that they found in the places alledged iuſt nothing to the purpoſe, as may appeare by their owne Rabbi Samuel in Bereſhith Rabba vpon the 14. of Geneſis, hath theſe words: He did reueale vnto him the ordinances of the great Prieſthood: meaning Aarons prieſthood, as appeareth by his interpreting y• bread to be the ſhewbread, and the wine to be the drink offerings. Otherwiſe, that Melchiſedech ſet forth the acts of prieſthood; or that he ſacrificed bread or wine, there is not one word: nothing that can be extended beyond Aarons prieſthood. Rabbi Phinees is not cited in that booke on the 28. of Numbers, nor in the whole Paraſhah: neither is there any thing to that purpoſe. Rabbi Moſes Hadarſhan in that booke on the 14 of Geneſis, is not cited: neither any thing to that purpoſe. Miles Smith, Iohn Layfield, William Bedwell. words, whereunto they haue ſubſcribed their names.
                  3 And to as little purpoſe is their confirmation taken from the teſtimonie of our Bibliander: for (not to enquire further then into the words as they are cited by the Apologiſts in the margēt) he ſaith, that 
                        The Apologiſts in the marge
                              ••
                           , at the letter, f. 
                     it was a moſt common opinion among the lewes to thinke, that at the comming of the Meſsias all the legall Sacrifices ſhould ceaſſe, and that onely the Sacrifice of Thoda, or of thankſgiuing, was to be performed in bread & wine: this ſentence doth eſtabliſh the doctrine of Proteſtants, who acknowledge in the Euchariſt (as Cardinall 
                        See aboue lib. 2. cap. 7. Sect. 5. Bellarmine confeſſeth) a Sacrifice Euchariſticall or of thanksgiuing: rather then it can countenance the faith of the Romaniſts, who make Melchiſedeks Sacrifice, wherein there was really both bread and wine, to be a type of their Sacrifice of the Maſſe, wherin (as they beleeue) there is nothing but the ſhewes

and colours of bread or wine: and for this cauſe haue bene conuinced of a 
                        See aboue lib. 2 cap. 7. Sect. 2. double folly. But this is the fate of ſubtiltie to entangle it ſelfe in it owne bird-lime.

               12 Twelfthly, as concerning their further opinion of the Churches Sacrifice vpon the coming of the Meſsias: our now ſacrifice is therein ſo plainly ſignified and affirmed by the ancient Iewes, who liued before Chriſts time, that (as Galatinus ſaith of one of them,) 
                  Galatinus de Areanis Catholicae veritatis, l. 1. cap. 3. circa med. they may be thought not ſo much to haue foretold things to come, as to haue reported Euangeliſt-like things alreadie done. To this end ſaith Rabbi Cahana, 
                  Rabbi Cahana ad cap. 49. Gen. ver. 11. The Sacrifice which ſhall be offered of wine, ſhall not onely be changed into the ſubſtance of the bloud of the Meſſias, but alſo into the ſubſtance of his bodie: the Sacrifice which ſhall be of bread notwithſtanding that it be white as milke, it ſhalbe conuerted into the ſubſtance of the bodie of the Meſſias. In like manner Rabbi Iudas ſaith, 
                  R. Iudas in 25. Exod. The bread ſhall be changed when it ſhalbe ſacrificed, from the ſubſtance of bread into the ſubſtance of the bodie of the Meſſias, which ſhal deſcend from Heauen, and he himſelfe ſhall be the ſacrifice, &c. Rabbi Simeon ſaith, 
                  R. Symeon filius Iohai libro qui inſcribitur reuelatio Secretorum. The ſacrifice which after the Meſſias his coming prieſts ſhall make, &c. they ſhall make it of bread and wine, &c. and that ſacrifice which ſhall be ſo celebrated vpon euerie Altar, ſhall be turned into the bodie of the Meſſias. Rabbi Barachias teacheth, that at the coming of the

                     Rabbi Simeon they anſwer, that he writ no booke carying the title of Reuelatio Secreterum. Of the reſt they iudge as no better than figments: which we the rather ſuſpect, becauſe otherwiſe their greateſt Rabbi (if we may ſo terme their Cardinal Bellarmine) would not haue loſt ſo great an aduantage, taken from the witneſſe of ſo ancient Iewes, eſpecially ſeeing that they are more plaine and pregnant for Tranſubſtantiation, then are the ſayings of Tranſubſtantiators themſelues. But this deluſion will better appeare by the dotage of their witueſſe Galatinus, who is that Author whom they profeſſe to follow. As for example:

               CHAP. XV. Of the ſupreme viſible Iudge of the old Testament.
               
               THE ROMISH APOLOGIE.
               13 Thirteenthly and lastly (to omit other points,) as concerning the finall ending of controuerſies, not onely Scripture, but a certaine viſible and liuely Iudge vpon earth was appointed and acknowledged. To omit all other proofe thereof, the law of Duteronomie was, that when there did 
                  Deuter. 17. 8. 9. 11. ariſe any matter too hard for the (people) in iudgement: they were appointed to go vp to the place which God had choſen, and to come to the Leuiticall Prieſt, and to the Iudge in thoſe daies: and to aske of them the ſentence of iudgement,

and to do according to the iudgement which they did tell, not declining neither to the right hand, nor to the left; it being yet further ſaid of him that did 
                  Deuter. 17. 12. preſumptuouſly refuſe to obey the commandement of the Prieſt, that by the decree of the Iudge that man ſhould die. Now that the ſentence grounded vpon this law, was not ſubiect to new queſtion, vnder colour of appealing to the Scriptures, but was definitiue and finall, and concerned aſwell Eccleſiaſticall as Ciuill cauſes, is in it ſelfe plaine, and for ſuch 
                  Doctor Rainolds in his Conference, pag. 251. ciremed. ſaith, The law of Deut cronomie was made to eſtabliſh a higheſt Court of Iudgement, in which all harder cauſes Eccleſtaſticall and Ciuill ſhould be determined without appeall further.

Bilſon in his perpetuall gouernment of Chriſts Church, pag 20. poſt med. ſaith hereof, that the ſame did concerne ſuch matters as were of greateſt moment, both ciuill and ſacred, and their ſentence by Gods law no man might refuſe without puniſhment of death. And ſee the like aſſertion in M. Hooker in his preface before his bookes of Eccleſiaſticall Policie, pag. 26 fine, & 27. & 28. fine. 
                  confeſſed by M. D. Rainolds, M. D. Whitaker, M. D. Bilſon, and M. Hooker. Whereupon it is euident, that not onely Scripture (which they of the old Teſtament had as well as we now haue) but beſides that, a certaine viſible Iudge was then appointed to determine controuerſies.
               
               
                  THE PROTESTANTS APPEALE.
                  SECT. 1.
                  
                     ANd that we may the better determine this controuerſie, it will be requiſite to know firſt, what was the ſtate of the Iewiſh Church, in reſpect of continuance. Hereof we reade, that firſt Chriſt in the daies of his fleſh approued the authoritie of The Scribes and Phariſees ſit in Moſes chaire, that which they ſhall ſay vnto you, that do. Matth. 23. 2. 
                     Moſes chaire. Secondly, in his owne perſon before his death, he celebrated the I haue deſired to eate ye Paſſeouer. Luc. 22. 15. 
                     Paſſeouer, which was a principall ſacrifice commanded in the Leuiticall law. Thirdly, at his death the veile of the Temple rent in twaine, Ioh. 19: betokening (as their owne Cardinall Ianſenius noteth,) that Ioh. 19. 30. Velum templi ſciſſum eſt.] Significans—quòd carnalis lex cum ſuis ſacrificijs omnibus iam finem acciperet, iuxtà vaticiniū, Dan. 9.

                     now all the Iewiſh law and ſacrifice was at an end, which had continued vntill that laſt conſummatum est, which Chriſt vttered, when the whole Leuiticall pedagogue firſt yeelded vp the ghoſt, and were not tranſlated (as our Poſt Domini paſſionem tranſlatum eſt ſacerdotium ad Chriſtianos.

Aduerſaries confeſſe) vntill the accompliſhment of Chriſts paſsion.
                  
                  2 We vnderſtand then, what was the time of the death of that Iewiſh Synagogue, and end of their ſacrifices, which notwithſtanding was not buried vntill the full publiſhing of the Goſpell, when the Apoſtles in a Councel at Ieruſalem did, by their decree of libertie from the law of Moſes (that we may ſo ſpeake,) celebrate her funerall.
                  3 Now are we to trie the ſufficiencie of the iudgement of that Synagogue, whileſt as ſhe liued the onely viſible Church of God: the iudgement therof, we ſay, was not law, but ſo farre as it was according vnto the law, as S. Paul taught in his reprehenſion of Ananias thus: 
                        Acts 23. 3. 
                     Thou ſitteſt here to iudge according vnto the law, & ſuffereſt thou me to be ſtriken cōtrary to the law? And the obediēce which is due vnto that iudgement, muſt needes be proportionable, that is, it hath in it a limited, and not an abſolute neceſſitie of obedience, as appeareth

by the obiected place of Deut. 17. 11: Thou ſhalt do according to the law which they ſhall teach.
                  
                  4 Which doctrine ought to be familiar vnto our Aduerſaries, ſeeing that their ordinarie Nota, quòd non dicitur tibi vt obedias, niſi

                     Prieſts, Prophets, & people in ſentēcing Ieremie to die. And how ſhould any haue eſcaped the guilt of the bloud of the innocent, yea of Innocencie it ſelfe, our Sauiour Chriſt Ieſus, the Prophet of Prophets, by conſenting vnto the blaſphemous voices of the high Prieſt and Councell of the Iewes, in adiudging vnto death him who was and is the Lord of life?
                  5 Therefore the fore-cited Proteſtants, as they could not but acknowledge the neceſſitie of ſome ſupreme court & iudgement, both Eccleſiaſticall and ciuill, in ſeuerall Churches, Kingdomes, and prouinces, euen vnder the Goſpell, for the finall determiner of all contention: yet did they neuer thinke either that iudgemēt of ſuch tribunals to be ſo infallible that it could not erre, or obedience of ſubiects ſo neceſſarie, that ſometime they might not diſſent in opinion.
                  6 Let M. Hooker ſpeake for all: 
                        M. Hooker in his Eccleſiaſticall Policie, Pref. pag. 29. 
                     Not that I iudge it (ſaith he) allowable for men to obſerue thoſe lawes, which in their hearts they are ſtedfastly perſwaded to be againſt the law of God: And a little after; An argument neceſſarie and demonſtratiue is ſuch as being propoſed vnto any man, and vnderstood, the mind cannot chooſe but inwardly aſſent. Any ſuch reaſon diſchargeth (I grant) the conſcience, and ſetteth it at full libertie. In ſuch caſe, according to S. Auguſt. Auguſtine his Councel, aut faciendum, aut patiendum, either muſt a man perſwade & practiſe a truth, or elſe willingly ſuffer for the truth by mans ſentence; which (according vnto the text of Deuteronomie) may inflict death, but hath not the infallible power of damnation. Thus much of the example of the Iewiſh tribunal. Now they proceed vnto an application.
                  
                     Of the application of the ſupreme Iudge in the law of Moſes.
                     THE ROMISH APOLOGIE.
                     
                        And for ſo much as the occaſion to haue controuerſies ended, is as great now as during the old Testament, the doubts of religion being as now many moe, and the danger of error no leſſe grieuous: whether therefore may it be thought that our 
                        Hebr. 8. 6. Teſtament which is eſtabliſhed in better promiſes, is wanting of this priuiledge? and ſo thereby the Eccleſiaſticall policie of Moſes time, to be preferred herein before that other which ſucceeded by Chriſt? With which onely laſt reaſon the Puritanes doubt not to 
                        Penrie in his ſupplication to ye high Court of Parliament, p. 21. fine, ſaith, That forme of gouernment which maketh our Sauiour Chriſt inferiour vnto Moſes, is an impious, vngodly, and vnlawfull gouernment, contrary to the word, &c. See him further, pag. 22. & 23. and peruſe the occaſion and circumſtance of this his reaſon, and it will appeare to hold much more ſtrong in this point, then in that other for which he vrgeth it. 
                        preſſe their other Proteſtant brethren in matters of much ſmaller importance.
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                  THE PROTESTANTS APPEALE: Shewing the errour of the Romaniſts in miſ-applying of the example of the Iewiſh gouernment, for proofe of the Papall Monarchie.
                  
                  SECT. 2.
                  7 The obiected argument can import no more then that which euerie Chriſtian will eaſily grant, to wit, that it is a greater impietie to violate the frame of gouernment which Chriſt would haue to be perpetuall in the Church, then it was to haue tranſgreſſed the ordinance which was deliuered by the mouth of Moſes, and was eſtabliſhed in the old Teſtament. Notwithſtanding, as the Theſis and poſition of Penrie, ſaying, that the ſame forme of gouernment, inſtituted by Chriſt, cannot without impietie be abrogated, was true; ſo his Hypotheſis or application, aſſuming that this forme fancied by him, was ordained by Chriſt, is fully erroneous.
                  8 But as he failed in the proofe of his manner of Presbyterie, ſo do our Aduerſa

Bellarmine yeeldeth the laſt and higheſt iudgement in the Church, yea euen aboue a generall Councell: we can ſhew that this application which they vſe, by analogie of the old Teſtament with the new, is vtterly infirme, becauſe in the Iewiſh kingdome there was as well one chiefe ciuill 
                        In Deut. 17. which is the text obiected.
                      
                     Iudge, as one ſpirituall high Prieſt.
                  9 So that, as they would thinke it a non-ſequitur for vs to reaſon thus: There was but one tēporall Iudge in Iſrael, Ergo there ought to be but one vniuerſal Monarch in the ciuil ſtate of all Chriſtendome: ſo muſt they confeſſe it to be a lame conſequence in their owne argument, wherby from one high Prieſt ordained in the particular kingdome of the Iewes, they contend to inferre the ſupreme iuriſdiction of one vniuerſall Biſhop ouer all Chriſtians in the world; contrarie vnto the ordinance of Chriſt, who (as hath bene 
                        See aboue lib. 2. cap. 17. confeſſed) did not chooſe one, but twelue Apoſtles, who were of equall iuriſdiction among themſelues. Thus much of the firſt point of their application, namely, of the ſingularitie of that perſon whom they propound for the vniuerſall Iudge. We enter vpon the next, ſhewing
               
               
                  The ſecond point of their application, viz. that the infallibilitie of truth in this their one Iudge (the Pope) is vainly pretended from the example of the high Prieſt of the old Teſtament: proued by compariſon of the Iewiſh and Romiſh doctrine herein.

                  11 This cometh now to be examined by the compariſon of the old Teſtament. In the Goſpell written by S. Iohn, we reade that Ioh. 11. v. 51. 
                     the chiefe Priests and Phariſees gathered a Councell, wherein Caiphas being high Prieſt that ſame yeare, prophecied that Chriſt ſhould die for the Nation: whereupon their Rhemiſts haue ſet this ſtampe and obſeruation: Rh

And if this man being many waies wicked, and in part an vſurper, and the Prieſthood being to decline, and to giue place to the new ordinance of Chriſt, had yet ſome aſsiſtance of God for vtterance of truth, which Caiphas himſelfe meant not; how much more may we be aſſured that Chriſt will neuer leaue Pete

14 In the defence of the iudgement of this See, their Cardinall Bellarmine proceedeth ſo farre as to affirme, that Pontificem ſolum, vel cum ſuo particulari Concilio aliquod in re dubia ſtatuentem, ſiue errare poſſit, ſiue non, eſſe ab omnibus ſidelibus obedienter audie ndū. Bellarm. lib. 4 de Rom. Pont. cap. 2. §. Deinde. 
                     whenſoeuer the Pope, albeit of himſelfe, ſhall determine any doubtfull doctrine, he muſt be obeied of all the faithfull, although it was poſsible for him to erre therein. Which we may iudge to be an high ſtep vnto the great apoſtaſie from the faith, eſpecially ſeeing that Popes are See hereafter. confeſſed to haue taught and confidently defended hereſie. And what acquaintance theſe and other kind of Romiſh poſitions may ſeeme to haue with the ſuperſtitious Rabbiniſh doctrines, their Hebrew Gloſſe will tell vs.
                  15 In the text, which hath bene obiected for the point in queſtion, the people of the Iewes are commanded to hearken vnto the ſentence of the Iudge, not declining either vnto the right hand, or to the left. Whereupon the Iewiſh Nec declinabis ad dexteram nec ad ſiniſtrā] Hic dicit Gloſſa Hebraica, Si dixerit tibi quod dextra ſit ſiniſtra, vel ſiniſtrá dextra, talis ſententia eſt tenenda. Gloſſe hath thus commented: If the Iudge ſhall tell thee, that the right hand is the left, and affirme the left to be the right, thou muſt beleeue him. Which therefore their Lyranus doth condemne of abſurditie, 
                     Quod patet manifeſtè falſum: quia ſententia nullius hominis, cuiuſcunque ſit authoritatis, eſt tenenda, ſi contineat manifeſtè falſitatem vel

                     becauſe (ſaith he) no iudgement, if it be manifeſtly falſe, may be beleeued by any man, of whatſoeuer authoritie he be. And M. 
                     
                        M. Hart in his anſwer to D. Rainolds in the place obiected by the Apologiſts, pag. 262. 
                     Hart noteth the ſame ſentence of Rabbi Selomoth to be fooliſh; which is plaine (ſaith he) frō the text of the ſame Scripture, which ſaith, Thou ſhalt do all things which they teach thee according vnto the law: wherefore to do all that the Priests taught, is not meant of things vngodly, but onely true and conſonant vnto the law of God. By which we ſee, that the ſentence of the Iudge is not abſolutely infallible, as the Apologiſts pretend, but that the reſolution of a mansconſcience is alwayes determined by the apparance of Gods law, that ſo God and not man may be the ſupreme Iudge.
                  16 Our Aduerſaries will replie, that their rule of beleeuing their Iudge holdeth onely where the caſe is doubtfull; but the Iewiſh Doctors challenge beliefe of an error manifeſt. Is this the point? And what if their Iudge ſhall See in the next Section following. call manifeſt truth into queſtion and doubt? then how, alas, ſhall he that muſt beleeue, diſcerne the right hand from the left? This the ſentence of Caiphas doth teach vs. Finally, that our readers may ſee what Proctors the Apologiſts haue choſen to further their cauſe in this queſtion of ſupreme iudgement, we hold it meete to ſhew how vnmateriall they are in the defence of Rabbiniſh authoritie, by their owne doctrines, as they are related by a Proteſtant author.

                     It is a generall rule among the Iewiſh Rabbins (ſaith he,) to teach men to be more mindfull of the words of the Scribes, then of the law of Moſes: among whom Sic in tractatu eorum Thalmudico Rabbi Iochanan: vnicuique Sabbatum ſic vt decet, iuſue eius & ordinatio requirunt, obſeruanti peceata condonantur, ita vt id ſanctificando idololatriam ſimul exercere non vereretur.

Cauete de fermento Phariſaeorum.] Si huiuſmodi Phariſaeorum doctrina hic per fermentum, cauenda ſignificatur, quomodo poſt dicit Dominus, [Sedent ſuper Cathedrā moyſis, quod dixerint facite.] Proinde ad literam Dominus non quamlibet Phariſaeorum doctrinam ſignificare voluit, ſed eam quâ docebāt, quae verè ipſorum erant mandata hominum, aut inutilia planè, aut mandatis Dei aduerſa. Ianſen. Concord. in eum locum Matth. cap. 64. 
                     that is, (ſaith he) do not reiect all their doctrines, but ſuch as are contrarte vnto the law of Moſes. More plainly their Ieſuite Maldonate; Dominus per [Cathedram Moſis] non de Phariſaeorum doctrina intelligit, ſed de doctrina legis ac Moſis loquitur: perinde enim eſt, acfi dixerit, Omnia quae Lex ac Moſes vobis dixerint. Maldonat. Ieſ. comment in hunc locum Matth.
                      
                     Chriſt (ſaith he) by the chaire of Moſes did not vnderſtand the doctrine of the Phariſees, but the doctrine of the law of Moſes.
                  
                  23 What chaire then do thoſe our Aduerſaries ſit in, who to the aduantaging of the Papal authority, do vnderſtand by Moſes chaire an infallibility of iudgement in the Phariſees & Prieſts of the law? We may coniecture therof by their Ieſuite Salmeron, who confeſſing that they of whom Chriſt ſpeaketh, Non erant audiendi, quando Chriſtum negabant eſſe Meſſiam, vel Chriſtum, quia haec non de Cathedra docebant. Salmeron Ieſ. tom. 4. part 3. tract. 32. §. Obijcies. pag. 609. 
                     were not to be obeied when they denied Christ to be the Meſsias, for then they ſpeake not out of the chaire: and yet we know that they denied Chriſt by the authoritie of their 
                        see aboue c. 15. §. 3. Councell; which ſheweth that the chaire of Moſes muſt ſignifie the ſucceſſion of true doctrine, without reference vnto the authoritie of mens perſons.

Arias Montanus in Matth. 23. pag. 80. in illa verba [Quia clauditis.] 
                     There were many myſteries in Scriptures (ſaith he) cō
                        cerning the way vnto Gods kingdome, which the Phariſees neglected that either themſelues or others ſhould know, but were wholy bent to the authorizing of their owne naked conſtitutions, which they deliuered void of expoſitions, not ſuffering any man to thinke, much leſſe to ſpeake any thing of Scripture, without their aduice and preſcript of their expoſitions, as appeareth by their ſaying to the blind man: Thou art borne in ſinne, and doeſt thou teach vs?
                  
                  25 Which affoordeth vs theſe due conſiderations: firſt, that thoſe profeſſors are moſt doubtfully, or rather deſperately erroneous, who make their chaire of authoritie to be an infallible argument of the truth of their doctrine, and not contrary-wiſe the apparance of doctrine in Scripture to be the chaire wherein mens conſciences may take their laſt reſt and reſolution, becauſe (as S. Auguſtine ſaith,) Sedem Eccleſiaſticam (inquit Auguſtinus) ſana doctrina conſtituit. Staple

                     It is a ſound doctrine which conſtituteth a chaire.
                  
                  26 Secondly, in that Chriſt commanded men to obey thoſe Phariſees, but quatenus, that is, ſo farre onely (in doctrines neceſſarily belonging vnto the kingdome of God,) as they truly proceeded out of Moſes chaire, which ſignifieth the written law of Moſes: we are iuſtified in our profeſſion to thinke

that in ſuch caſes not the authoritie of man, but the law written is the ſupreme Iudge of mens conſciences.
                  27 Thirdly, that thoſe profeſſors, who vpon the Prieſtly authoritie of the Iewiſh Synagogue (which idolatrouſly & blaſphemouſly erred from truth) would reare vp the opinion of an infallibility of iudgement in their Popes, whom our Aduerſaries haue confeſſed to haue bene poſſeſſed with contradictions, and (as will be See hereafter. acknowledged) were plunged in hereſies, cauſeth vs to feare that the pretended chaire of truth is tranſlated into the forme of the chaire of apoſtaſie.
                  28 Laſtly, that authoritie of the externall viſible Iudge, (which is a Councell) for the deciding of doubtfull points of controuerſies, wherein the direct law of God onely, and not mans peremptorie will and fancie is made the chaire, Proteſtants do more willingly See aboue. acknowledge, then do our Aduerſaries, who indeed draw too neare the now Iewiſh preſumption, (which our Buxdorfius hath related,) whereby they (viz. Iewes) do profeſſe, Rabbi Iſaac Abhuhabh, anno Chriſti 1493. ſcribit in libro Menoras Hammaor, Omni quodcunque Rabbini noſtri in concionibus & myſticis, aut allegoricis explicationibus docuerunt & loquuti ſunt, nos non minus firmiter atque bene quàm legi Moſis fidem adiungere tenemur. In quo ſi quid inueniatur quod nobis hyperbolicum, vel naturae prorſus contrarium videtur,—nos culpam illam intellectui noſtro defectuoſo, non autem verbis ipſorum aſcribere debemus. Buxdorfius lib. Synag. Iudaic. cap. 1. pag. 62. 
                     that they are bound to giue as great beliefe vnto the myſticall and allegorical expoſitions of the Rabbins, as vnto the law of Moſes: wherein if any thing (ſay they) be deliuered which may ſeeme to be repugnant vnto nature, we muſt impute this vnto the defect of our vnderſtanding, and not vnto the words of our Doctors. I would but aske the Romaniſts, whether they thinke that there is any thing in all the profeſſion of the Iews, which is a greater barre to hinder their cōuerſion vnto the faith of Chriſt then this thraldome of their ſoules by beleeuing, not what the light of Scripture may teach their own iudgement, but what that their preiudice doth foreſtall, which they haue in the iudgement of their teachers; who by their cloudie allegories do darken and dimme the light of Scriptures. This granted (which none can denie) by the application hereof their like preſumption is confuted, and our religion better fortified and eſtabliſhed.
               
            
            
               CHAP. XVI. Concerning the concluſion of the Apologiſts Demonſtration of their Romiſh faith, from the faith of the Iewiſh Rabbins.
               
               THE ROMISH APOLOGIE.
               
                  By which ſo many foreſaid examples of our Catholike faith, thus affirmed by the ancient Iewes that liued before Chriſts coming, it is made further probable, that our religion is not new or lately deuiſed, but moſt ancient and vndoubtedly Apoſtolike: which point is made as yet much more cleare by that which is hereafter 
                  See hereafter, tract. 1. ſect. 7. & 8. 
                  alledged concerning the Romane Church being conuerted in the Apoſtles time, and her not being ſit hence changed in religion.
               
               
                  THE PROTESTANTS APPEALE: By irrefutable arguments conuincing the groſſe ſophiſtrie of the Apologists Demonſtration out of the ancient Iewes, by a Demonſtration from the faith of more ancient and more religious Iewes: from the confeſsions of our learned Aduerſaries, in many principall points belonging,
                     
Firſt vnto morall duties concerning man.

                     THe argument which the Apologiſts haue taken from the faith of ancient Iewes, for the confirmation of (as they ſay) their Catholicke faith, they haue entituled a Demonstration, whereby is ſignified a reaſon ſo euident and infallible, that euerie diſcreete Reader muſt thereunto forthwith yeeld his aſſent: and hereupon haue they founded their concluſion, to beleeue that the Romane religion is moſt ancient and vndoubtedly Apoſtolicke: which argument hath bene found to be rather ſuch a demonſtration of the want of iudgement in their Galatinus, Coccius, and theſe Apologiſts, as though they had ſtudied and profeſſed to make themſelues notoriouſly vaine: becauſe the foundation almoſt of all their proofes is the Iewiſh Thalmud, and Cabala, which our Aduerſaries confeſſe to be no better then two muddie lakes, and ſinkes of

                  2 But let them ſet vpon this argument (if they can) an edge of ſteele; the ſharper it is, and the more vehemently they ſt

                     ike Proteſtants therewith, the more deadly will it wound themſelues, when by a iuſt retorſion it ſhall be turned (as it were) into their owne bowels; as will appeare by comparing the opinions of the Iewes and of Romaniſts together.
                  3 True iuſtifying faith is deſcribed by S. Paul, to be that which

                  5 Secondly, the Romiſh profeſſion of ſoueraignty ouer Kings, to depoſe them, is made not onely viſible vnto vs by their bookes and Buls, but palpable alſo by their practiſe. Will they ſuffer the ancient Iewiſh Rabbins to be our Iudges? or will they allow Moſes the Prophet of God, and the firſt proclaimer of Gods written law, to be one of the ancient Rabbins? then let them heare their owne Ieſuit Salmeron, witneſſing in this caſe, and confeſſing, that Miſſa poteſtate ſpirituali legis naturae, vel Moyſi, quae minor erat regia poteſtate in veteri Teſtamento; & ideo etiam ſummi Sacerdotes regibus ſubdebantur, ſicut etiamapud Gentiles: de poteſtate Eccleſiaſtica diſſerendum.

                  6 Thirdly, the Romaniſts admit none vnto ſacred Orders without a ſolemne vow of ſingle life; and if it happē that any by entring into the ſtate of matrimonie ſhall breake that vow, his marriage is commanded to be diſſolued. In briefe, the Proteſtant Miniſters who are married, are by them therefore called carnall and vncleane: albeit that this the Prieſts mariage (as our Aduerſaries haue 
                        See aboue cap. 2. §. 33. confeſſed) was not forbidden either in the old or new Teſtament. And as for the Monaſticall vow, if that had bene anciently Iewiſh, then would not their

                     the Fathers did thinke ſuch imagerie to be vnlawfull, although (ſaith he) not in it ſelfe, yet becauſe of the danger of idolatrie in the rude multitude.
                  
                  8 The difference in the ſecond queſtion concerning the worſhipping of Chriſt in an Image, is no leſſe then the former: whereof their Ieſuite Gretzerus auoweth, calling it their Nunc explicandum, quo genere cultus colenda ſit, non modò prima illa crux Chriſti, ſed & omnes imagines, & ſigna crucis.

                     common iudgement, that the croſſe of Chriſt is to be worſhipped, although improperly, with Latria, which is an honour properly due vnto God. But what was the profeſſion of the ancient people of God among the Iewes? Their Ieſuite Vaſquez doth tell vs of Permulti enim affirmant, nunquam nec in lege veteri imaginum picturam, aut ſculpturam ſtatuarum, imò nec ipſarum debitum cultum, ſed ſolùm idololatriae adorationem fuiſſe pohibitam; ne ſcilicet eas populus cultu diuino, ſicut Gert les ſua idola, proſequeretur: and citeth for the defenders of this opinion, Beda, Ionas Aurelianenſis, D.

                     who (as he ſaith) were not either fewer in number, or inferiour in eſtimation, who held the contrarie; and which the Ieſuite himſelfe doth iudge to be the more probable opinion: which is indeed more then probable, as is euident out of Ioſephus, from whom their Ieſuite Gretzerus proueth, that Ioſephus lib. 15. cap. 11. Nihil Iudaeis tam moleſtum fuit, quám Trophaea, qui cum putarent armis contectas imagines quarum vſus interdictus eſt noſtris legibus, indigniſſimè eas ferebant. Gretzer. de Cruce, l. 1. c. 44. pag. 121. 
                     the Iewes
                     
                     did hate the verie Images of men in their heatheniſh Trophees, as being forbidden them by God.
                  
                  9 Secondly, as the faithfull worſhipper muſt take heed in what he honoureth God, ſo muſt he beware vnto whom he commendeth the praiers of his mouth and thoughts, leſt he attribute vnto any ſoule departed (by inuocating) the power of vnderſtanding of all the caſes of men in the world, if haply all ſhould pray vnto that one: which is a propertie whereby ancient Fathers diſcerned the deitie of the holy Ghoſt. Now the Romaniſts teach this vniuerſall Inuocation to be communicable vnto euerie Saint departed, calling the Proteſtants 
                        See aboue lib. 2 cap. 12. Sect. 1. 
                     impious for denying it: notwithſtanding they themſelues confeſſed the 
                        See ibid. Sect. 3. 
                     Inuocation of ſoules departed not to haue bene in vſe among the Iewes, in the ſtate of the old Teſtament, for feare of Idolatry: nor yet taught vnto them in the new Teſtament at their firſt conuerſion vnto the faith of Chriſt. But why? Becauſe (ſay our Aduerſaries) thoſe Iewes would haue thought it an hard matter to be commanded to pray vnto Saints departed: ſo meerely ſtrangers were thoſe true Iewes vnto this Romiſh article of Inuocation.
                  10 Thirdly, true praier is the breath of true faith, which faith will alwaies feare to offer vnto God 
                        Eccleſ. 5. 2. 
                     the ſacrifice of fooles: of which kind, in the opinion of Proteſtants, are all thoſe praiers which men of capacitie and vnderſtanding do offer in a tongue which they do not vnderſtand. Now the Romiſh Councell of Trent hath Eccleſia noſtra prohibet ne diuina officia, & praeſertim Miſſae ſacrificium vulgatâ linguâ celebretur: nam poſtremum Concil. Trid. Seſſ. 23. cap. 8, & 9. tra lit aliter, docentes Anathemate eſſe percellendos. Salmeron. Ieſ. Tom. 14 comm. in 1. Cor. 16. diſp. 30 pag. 257. and Bellarm. lib. 2. de verbo Dei, ca. 16. Ledeſima Ieſ. lib. de diuinis ſcript. cap. 13. 
                     forbidden that the publike praiers of the Church ſhould be vſed in the vulgar and common language of Chriſtian people, fixing an Anathema vpon euerie one that ſhall dare to affirme the contrarie; albeit the Rabbin Aben Ezra dehortatur ne quis talibus vtatur orationibus, in quibus non intelligitur quid oratur. As ſaith our Mercerus, com. in Eccleſiaſten. 5. 2. pag 113. 
                     Aben Ezra doth dehort men from vſing praiers which they do not vnderſtand. And it cannot be denied but that the Church of the Iewes, by Gods ordinance, vnder Moſes, had their publike ſeruice in Hebrew, their mother tongue.
                  11 Fourthly, faith is that inſtrument, which maketh the 
                        Rom. 10. 10. 
                     heart to beleeue vnto iuſtification, and the mouth to confeſſe vnto ſaluation: and therefore deſireth to enioy the prerogatiue which it hath in Chriſt, which is by (although vnto God onely) vnfeined confeſſion, and to expect the grace of remiſsion of ſinnes: contrary-wiſe the Romaniſts teach ſuch a 
                        See aboue lib. 2 cap. 14. Sect. 3. 
                     neceſsitie of auricular confeſſion vnto the Prieſt, that without this dependance either in act, or in vow and purpoſe, no man may hope for a pardon at Gods hands. Will the Apologiſts ſuffer the ſtate of the true Iudaiſme to be our example? See ibid. 
                     Among the Iewes (as their Lyra and Cardinall Tolet haue witneſſed) confeſsion of particular ſinnes vnto the Prieſt was not neceſſarie.
                  
                  12 Fiftly, faith faſteneth vpon the promiſe of God, made not onely vnto it ſelfe, but euen vnto the ſeed alſo, ſo farre as the off-ſpring ſhal not reiect the couenant of God. Concerning this point the Romaniſts haue taught, that 
                        See aboue lib. 2 cap. 13. Sect. 1. 
                     no child born of Chriſtian parēts, dying without baptiſme, can inherit life: notwithſtā
                     ding that in the old Teſtament, where (as hath bene confeſſed) 
                        See ibid, Sect. 6 
                     Circumciſio
                           •
                         was a Sacrament of remiſsion of originall ſinne, the children dying vncircumciſed were not excluded frō grace. Our Aduerſaries will peraduenture obiect, that the ſtate of the new Teſtament is more perfect, & therfore the Sacraments therof more neceſſarie: but let them from this obiection conſider, whether that the

grace of God be not hereby more commended, that it iſſueth immediatly vpon the ſeed of the faithfull, & not by an abſolute neceſſitie vnto Elements; and whether the grace be not greater, where the danger of the childs damnation is leſſe. Now then (that we may ſtand vnto the analogie, which is betweene the ſeales of both the couenants, Circumciſion of the old, and Baptiſme of the new) Infantulos aegrotantes die octauo non circumcidunt, ſed circumciſionem differunt vſque eò dum valetudinem recuperarint. Our Buxdorſius out of the Gloſſe of the Thalmud. Buxdorſius Synag. Iud. cap. 2. 
                     the Iewes did not circumciſe their children at the eight day as God had commanded, if they were ſicke at that time, but deferred it vntill the child had gathered ſtrength. And ſhall; we do not ſay: the contemptuous, but religious delay of Baptiſme, with intent that the Sacrament may be more ſolemnly performed, be held damnable among Chriſtians?
               
               
                  Other articles and principles of the faith of the Church, euen the holy Scriptures, held by Proteſtants, and confirmed by the expoſition of the ancient Iewes: from the conſeſsion of our learned Aduerſaries.
                  SECT. 3.
                  13 Diuine Scriptures are the common principles and foundation of faith, which it eyeth eſpecially in three points, integritie, communitie, and ſufficiencie.
                  Firſt, in the integritie Proteſtants require two things, the perfect Canon of Scriptures of the old Teſtament, and tranſlation immediatly deriued from the Hebrew text. Of the Canon of the bookes of the old law, the Romiſh Councell of Trent hath thus defined:

This is a great and neceſſarie controuerſie, wherein we contend about the conduits of pure water from the fountaine of life.

                     If the Iewes (ſay they) corrupted the Scriptures, they muſt haue done it either before, or after the coming of Chriſt. If before, then would Chriſt or his Apoſtles haue reproued them for ſo great a crime as this, ſeeing they reprehended them for leſser faults; would Chriſt haue inuited them to read the Scriptures without premoniſhing them to take heed of reading the Scriptures which were corrupted, if then there had bene that offence? If any ſhall ſay, that they were corrupted ſince; how then cometh it to paſſe that almost all the Scriptures cited by Chriſt and his Apoſtles are yet found in the Bible of the Iewes?
                  
                  17 Another argument is taken from S. Auguſtine, who ſaith, that the Alterum argumentum eſt ex Auguſtino in lib. 15. de Ciuit. c. 13. vbi probat quòd non videtur vllo modo credibile, Iudaeos voluiſſe ſuis codicibus eripere veritatem, vt noſtris detraherent authoritatem; & etiamſi voluiſſent, non ſit veriſimile potuiſſe.— 
                     Iewes neither could, nor would corrupt them. And leſt any might ſuſpect that ſince thoſe times of Hierome and Auguſtine they haue bene violated, their foreſaid Cardinall doth vndertake their further defence, ſaying, that the Dicet aliquis, generalem hanc deprauationem Heb. codicum poſt Hieron & Auguſtini tempora acc

                         preſerued: and therefore doth the ſame Author not doubt to call the Hebrew edition authenticall.
                  
                  19 As for the quarrell which Driedo and ſome others tooke againſt it, becauſe of the Points, which the Rabbins added for the better vnderſtanding

of the text, it is anſwered by their Cardinall, that Driedo dicit irrepſiſſe errores ignorantiâ Rabbinorum, qui addiderunt puncta.—Caeterùm non tanti momenti ſunt eiuſmodi errores, vt in eis quae ad fidem & bonos mores pertinent, ſacrae Scripturae integritas deſideretur,—puncta enim illa extrinſecus addita ſunt nec textum mutant. Itaque poſſumus, ſi volumus puncta detrahere. Bellar. lib. 2. de verbo Dei, cap. 2. §. Caeterum fine. 
                     thoſe errours are not ſo great that they may detract from the integritie of the Hebrew Scripture in all thoſe things which concerne either faith or godlineſſe, yet do thoſe points alter the text.
                  
                  20 This being the confeſſed integritie of the Hebrew Bible, it can be no queſtion whether the Proteſtants tranſlations, profeſſedly following that Hebrew originall, are like to be more perfect then is the Romiſh vulgar Latine tranſlation, which their Sacroſancta Synodus—ſtatuit vt haec ipſa vetus & vulgata Editio, quae longo tot ſeculorū vſ

                     Councell of Trent hath decreed to be authenticall, and none but it; eſpecially ſeeing that it is confeſſed firſt by their owne Senenſis, that Etiam Sanctes Pagninus, Praedicatorij Ordinis concionator Apoſtolicus, vir in diuinis Scripturis apprimè eruditus,—ſed Hebraeae potiſſimùm peritiſſimus, cum animaduertiſſet celebrem illam Hieronymi verſionem temporum iniuriâ, & hominum incuriâ vel magna ex parte intercidiſſe, vel magna ex parte fuiſſe corruptam,—Leone decimo Pont. hortante, collatis inter ſe probatiſſimis Hebraeorum exemplaribus, quantâ valuit fide & induſtria omne vetus Teſtamentum ex Hebraica veritate latinitate donauit.—Quam Editionem peritiſſimi Rabbini omnibus, quae nunc extant, Tranſlationibus praeferunt. Sixtus Senenſis Bibl. lib. 4. Tit. Sanctes Pagninus. pag. 101. 
                     Sanctes Pagninus, a Preacher of the Order of the Predicants, and a man most skilfull in the Hebrew tongue, when he had perceiued the corruptions of the old vulgar tranſlation, did by the Councell of Pope Leo the tenth, conſult with the beſt Hebrew copies, and then turned them into a Latine tranſlation, which the Iewiſh Rabbins preferre before any now extant.
                  
                  21 Secondly, euen Galatinus himſelfe beareth witneſſe, that In quibus (ſpeaking of the Scriptures in Hebrew) longè planius longeue perfectius apud Hebraeos, quàm in noſtrâ ſiue Latina, ſiue Graeca editione fulget Chriſtiana veritas. Quocirca me à multis carptum iri haudquaquam dubito; & ab his praeſertim qui quicquid ipſi non fecerint, arguere ſolent, & omnia vituperant, quae ignorant. Galatinus Praef ante opus de Arcanis fid.
                      
                     the Hebrew Scripture is much more perfect then is the Latine. This he made bold to affirme, albeit he knew that ſome (they be his owne words) would carpe at him and reproue him. Which may be proued (to paſſe ouer multitudes of particular examples in this kind,) by their Cardinall: Argumentum quartum eſt: Si Iudaei falſare voluiſſent diuinas Scripturas in odium Chriſtianorum, ſine dubio praecipua vaticinia ſuſtuliſſent: id autem minimè fecerunt, ſiquidem ea, in quibus diſcrepant Hebraea à Graecis & Latinis, ſaepè nullius ſunt momenti, quantum attinet ad fidem & religionem: & ſaepè codices Hebraei magis Iudaeos vexant, quim Graeci aut Latini. 
                     This may be an argument (ſaith he) that the Iewes would not depraue the Scriptures in hatred of Chriſtians, for then would they haue razed out the chiefest places and prophecies of Chriſt, but oftentimes we find that the Hebrew texts do more trouble the (vnbeleeuing) Iewes, then do either the Greeke (Septuagints) or the vulger Latine tranſlations. As for example: Certè in Pſal. 2. Latini & Graeci habent [Apprehendite diſciplinam, ne iraſcatur Dominus:] ex quo nihil apertè contra Iudaeos deduci poteſt. At in Hebraeo [Oſculamini filium ne iraſcatur]—qui locus eſt inuictiſſimus contra Iudaeos.— 
                     In the ſecond Pſalme where the Latine hath [Receiue diſcipline, leſt the Lord be angrie] out of the Latine there ariſeth no euident argument fit to confute the Iewes, but the Hebrew text is inuincibly ſtrong againſt them. The ſecond place is 
                     Item Eſa. 53. Vbi nos habemus [Et nos putaùimus eum quaſi—percuſſum à Deo,] in Hebraeo legi poteſt [Perc
                           •

                     Eſa. 51. where the Latine hath it, [And we thought him to be beaten of God:] but in the Hebrew thus, [And we thought him to be beaten and humbled God.] Which place doth greatly trouble and afflict the obſtinate Iewes.
                  
                  22 Let now any conſcience of man examine and iudge firſt, which profeſſors are more zealous of truth, in embracing the Oracles of God, whether Proteſtants, who do as preciſely as they can follow the Hebrew, which hath bene acknowledged to be a pure fountaine, or the Romaniſts, who content themſelues with the Nemo illam quouis praetextu reijcere audeat.

               That true miracles make a ſtrong argument: And that the aforeſaid faith whereunto the Engliſh were conuerted, was confirmed with ſuch Miracles. §. 5.

                  THE PROTESTANTS APPEALE.
                  SECT. 1.
                  
                     PRoteſtants are here vnneceſſarily produced to conſent vnto that which no Chriſtian will or can denie, viz. that the miracles wrought by our Sauiour Chriſt and his Apoſtles were the infallible ſeales of Gods truth. For the Apologiſts being now in a controuerſie, ſhould haue applied their wits to the confirmation of the point controuerted, and not ſo copiouſly haue proſecuted a matter, which is without all queſtion: becauſe we are not to diſpute of the miraculous gifts in the Churches infancy, which were for the eſtabliſhing of the Goſpell, ſo glorious, that they who attributed them vnto 
                        Matth. 12. 31. 
                     Beelzebub, did commmit irremiſsible ſinne againſt the holy Ghoſt. But our queſtion is concerning the neceſſitie and infallibilitie of the vſe of Miracles in all after-times, and eſpecially in this decrepit age of the Church wherein we now liue, & whereof our Aduerſaries in the point of Miracles make no ſmall oſtentation. We therefore, (as it is moſt requiſite in all diſquiſition of truth) do firſt ſet downe
               
               
                  The ſtate of the controuerſie betweene the Proteſtants and Romanists.
                  SECT. 2.
                  2 In all the Romaniſts there is defended a perpetuall vſe of Miracles, not onely of all former times (ſay the Apologiſts) but alſo of this preſent age: profeſſing furthermore, that Nunc noſtram Eccleſiam demonſtremus eſſe veram Dei Eccleſiam ex miraculis, quae ſingulis aetatibus habuit plurima & teſtatiſſima.—Denique hoc noſtro ſeculo. Bellar. lib. 4 de notis Eccleſ. cap. 14. §. Veniamus nunc. & §. Denique. Nullum ſeculum, nullaue aetas miraculis caruit. Coſterus Ieſ. Apolog. part. 3. cap. 9. pag. 555. In Eccleſia Catholica ſemper fuerunt. Poſſeuinus de notis verbi Dei, fol. 31. 
                     the power of working miracles hath bene perpetually in the Church of Rome, and is now alſo an euident note of the truth thereof. Vpon which preſumption they proceed to exact of Proteſtants the teſtimonie of miracles, which Caluin ſaith (ſaith Cardinall Bellarmine) may not be expected of them, inaſmuch as they profeſſe the ſame doctrine of the Apostles, which in the beginning was ſufficiently confirmed by Apoſtolicall miracles. Thus their Cardinall hath acknowledged the true ſtate of this controuerſie. Now what is the truth in this contradiction, may be euinced both by the teſtimonies of antiquitie, and cleare confeſſions of our learned Aduerſaries. Firſt from antiquitie we ſhew, b Caluinus reſpondit—nos illis iniuriam facere, quod miracula ab illis exigimus, cum ipſi doctrinam antiquam & innumeris miraculis ab Apoſtolis & Martyribus confirmatam praedicent. Bellar. lib. 4. de notis Eccleſ. cap. 14. §. Reſpondet. Caluiniani nullis ſe miraculis à Deo Miſſos docent. Maldon. Ieſ. com. in Ioh. 2. 18. Catechumenus miraculum expectabit à Caluiniſta, quod vel ipſe praeſtet, vel patratum à ſuis veraci hiſtoria confirmet: hoc vnum poſtulatum illi os obſtruet; cum enim omnia luſtrauerit, non poſſit ob oculos ſiſtere vel vnum canem, cuius fracta tibia Caluiniſtae alicuius precibus hucuſque fuerit reſtituta. Weſtonus Anglus, Profeſſor Duaci, lib. de triplici hominis officio, c. 25.
                  
               
               
                  That confidence in Miracles in this later age of the world, is preiudiciall vnto the Chriſtian faith: proued by the teſtimonies of ancient Fathers.

                  4 Which was partly the replie of S. Auguſtine againſt the Donatists and others; ſaying moreouer of his owne time, that Quod dixi, nec miracula illa in noſtra tempora durare permiſſa ſunt, ne anima ſemper viſibilia quaereret, & eorum conſuetudine frigeſceret genus humanum, quorum nouitate flagrauit, verum eſt quidem: non enim nunc vſque cum manus imponitur baptizatis, ſic accipiunt Spiritum ſanctum, vt loquantur linguis omnium gentium; aut nunc vſque ad vmbram tranſcuntium praedicatorum Chriſti ſanantur infirmi & ſi qua talia tunc facta ſunt, quae poſte à ceſſâſſe manifeſtum eſt. Sed non ſic accipiendum eſt quod dixi▪ vt nunc in Chriſtinomine miracula nulla credantur. Auguſt tom. 1. Retract. lib. 1. c. 13. 
                     ſome miracles are not ſuffered now to be wrought, leſt that the ſoule of man ſhould beleeue by the eye; theſe being the times wherein Nemo itaque dicat, iſta modò non facere (miracula) Dominum, & propter hoc praeſentibus Eccleſiae temporibus priora praeponere. Quodam quippe loco ipſe Dominus videntibus & ideo credentibus (Ioh. 20.) praeponit cos qui non vident & credunt. Auguſt. tom. 10. de verb. Dom. Ser. 18. ſub initiū.
                      
                     thoſe must be preferred, who (Iohn. 20.) beleeue and ſee not: 
                     Quiſquis adhuc prodigia, vt credat, inquirit, magnum eſt ipſe prodigiū. Aug. lib. 22. de ciuit. Dei, c. 8. 
                     when whoſoeuer ſhall deſire wonders, he ſhall make himſelfe a wonder and a monſter. Noting, laſtly, that therefore Contra iſtos mirabiliarios cautum me fecit Deus meus dicens, (Marc. 13) In nouiſſimis temporibus exurgent pſeudoprophetae, qui ſigna facient,—Ecce praedixi vobis. Ergo cautos nos fecit ſponſus, quia non debemus miraculis decipi. Auguſt. tom. 9. tract. 13. in Ioh. cap. 3. 
                     Chriſt gaue vs warning of theſe workers of maruels (when Mark. 13. he taught vs that ſuch falſe Prophets and workers of ſignes ſhould come) to take heed that we be not deceiued.

                     As though it were not written againſt hereticks, pretending the power of Miracles (ſaith Tertullian,) that ſuch workers ſhall come for the corrupting of the truth? like as it is of ſalfe Prophets, Iterum praemonet Chriſtus & inſtruit, ne quis à pſeudoprophetis & pſeudochriſtis in nomine ſuo facilè fallatur: Multi, inquit, venient in nomine meo, dicentes, Ego ſum Chriſtus, & multos fallent: & poſtea addidit, dicens, Vos autem cauete, ecce praedixi vobis. Vnde apparet, non ea ſtatim ſuſcipienda & aſſumenda, quae iactantur in nomine Chriſti, ſed quae geruntur in Chriſti veritate. Cyprian. ad Iubaianum de Heret. rebaptiz.
                      
                     deceiuing many (ſaith S. Cyprian:) wherefore Chriſt hath giuen vs a caueat to take heed, and not to admit of all things done in the name of Chriſt, but ſuch onely as are done in the truth of Chriſt. And to vſe the remedie giuen by Chriſt, which is remembred by Theodoret, viz. Inſtruimur non credere, quando, qui talia edit, contraria pretati docet. Theod in Deut.
                      
                     not to beleeue them, who worke Miracles, and teach vngodlineſſe. Wherefore we need not feare with S. Chryſoſtome to conclude, that Dicit Chryſoſtomus: Non ergo ſides iam—ſatis fundata miraculis, nouis indiget confirmari, quin potius vtilius eſſe aſſerit ſignis nunc carere, quoniam maioris meriti ſit. Acoſta Ieſ. lib. 2. de procur. ſalut. Indorum, cap. 9. pag. 223. 
                     it is more profitable for vs now to want Miracles, it being a matter of more worthineſſe not to beleeue thē.

                  6 This difference of times, by theſe Fathers thus rightly obſerued, yeeldeth (if in their daies, much more in theſe, inclining to the laſt period of times) this prerogatiue to Chriſtians, to be directed in the truth by the eye of faith, and not by the eye of ſence: ſo much the more, becauſe in the latter times the profeſſion of Miracles ſhall be (as it is prophecied of them) matter of deluſion, and therefore not to be expected of Chriſtians, but ſuſpected. This is the common doctrine of Proteſtants, whereof our Aduerſaries ſhall haue leſſe cauſe to doubt, when they ſhall further vnderſtand,
               
               
                  That the ſame doctrine, againſt the perpetuall neceſsitie of Miracles of latter times, is confirmed by the direct confeſsion of our learned Aduerſaries.
                  SECT. 4.
                  7 The generall doctrine of the now Romiſh Church is, as we find it in Cardinall Bellarmine and others, to profeſſe the

                     power of Miracles, to be a perpetuall viſible note of the true Church: thereupon Bellar. quo ſuprà. reprouing Proteſtants for holding that in the laſt times the ſecuritie of our faith muſt conſiſt in the knowledge of Scriptures, which haue forewarned vs cōcerning the latter ages, that the opinion of Miracles ſhall be but an occaſion of ſeduction.
                  8 Which we (notwithſtanding the 
                        The Apologiſts haue pried into a marginall note of the Engliſh Bible, printed Anno 1576. (in which yeare was the firſt impreſſion of that newer editiō) although the older Engliſh Bible printed both before, and about the ſame yeare hath no ſuch annotation: which hath bene thus expounded in the after editions, and namely in that of Anno 1601. viz. The approuing of the vertue of Chriſt is not included within his owne perſon, but is ſpread through the body of his whole Church. This point of the perpetuitie of the vſe of miracles for confirmation of the faith, being the maine point of difference, ought to haue bene confirmed by the Apologiſts with better proofe then one onely obſcure note, which they knew was afterward by an explanation corr

                     They are not neceſſarie at all, where there are no Infidels. If we aske a reaſon hereof, their Ieſuite Del'rio doth well ſatisfie, ſaying: Quod dicit I. C. pauciorum miraculorum hodiè cauſam eſſe inconſtantiam fidei, & teporē, ea quidem vna eſt, ſed melior alia, quia ſtabilita iam ſemel fide, minor vel nulla eſt neceſſitas eorum.

                     Beſides the now-inconſtancie and weakneſſe of mens faith, which is the cauſe that Miracles are now ſo ſcarce, the principall reaſon is, that the faith being once establiſhed, there is either litle or no neceſsitie of them at all. And leſt any may thinke, that therefore the hand of God is now ſhortned, their learned Biſhop confeſſeth, that in this cauſe we muſt be directed by the will of God, Cum plurimi ſunt qui fidem eandem cum priſcis fidelibus habeant, qui miracula non faciunt, non tamen inanis eſt promiſſio, quam noluit effectum habere perpetuum, ſed pro tempore naſcentis & adoleſcentis Eccleſiae.

                     who would not that Miracles ſhould haue their perpetuall effect, which was proper onely vnto the non-age of the Church. Whereunto the iudgement of their Ieſuite Acoſta doth accord, where he diligently obſerueth

that Religio Chriſtiana, vbi humana praeſidia prorſus aberant, diuinis eſt fundata miraculis: At noſtrorum temporum longè alia eſt ratio.—Quid magnorum ſignorum confirmatione eſt opus?—vnū illud potētiſſimū & ad fidem efficaciſſimum, ac penè ſingulare miraculum, mores cum fide coniungere. Acoſta Ieſ. lib. 2 de Indorum ſalute, cap. 9. pag. 222, 223. 
                     there is a diuerſe reſpect herein to be had betweene the primitiue Church, when our faith was founded by Miracles, and theſe our times, wherein there is no ſuch neceſsitie of them.
                  
                  9 But we haue furthermore affirmed, that the opinion of the vſe of Miracles is alſo dangerous: which is no more then their owne learned Preacher hath taught when ſpeaking of the vſe of Miracles among Chriſtians, whether they be Catholicks or hereticks, he ſaith: Dices, nonne rationi conſentaneum eſſet & conueniens, vt nunc aliq
                           ••
                         fierent miracula,—vt magis fides confirmaretur? Non vtique, nam miracula nobis nunc damnum potiús afferrent quám commodum.—etiamſi in tempore naſcentis Eccleſiae fuerint neceſſaria. Puer enim, quando ambulare incipit, adiuuatur vehiculo,—quod homini adulto eſt impedimento. Stella in Luc. 11. pag. 64. Tom. 2. 
                     Now Miracles would not be conuenient for confirmation of the faith: for as a child in his weakneſſe, is by a wheeleſtoole enabled to walke, the vſe whereof would be an hinderance vnto him, when be cometh to be of a more perfect age; ſo in the infancie of the Church Miracles were neceſſary for the ſtrengthning of the faith, which in theſe daies would be but inconuenient. This danger will be more ſenſible vnto vs, when we ſhal haue proued our next Aſſertion, viz.
               
               
                  That the Proteſtants doctrine of not beleeuing the Miracles of the latter times, is a requiſite doctrine of beliefe: and is proued by the publicke confeſsions of our learned Aduerſaries.
                  SECT. 5.
                  10 No man exerciſed in the word of truth, can be ignorant how it is prophecied of the latter times, that the profeſſion of Miracles ſhal be the principall meanes of apoſtaſie from the truth: our Sauiour plainly prefining, that 
                        Matth. 24. 24. 
                     in the latter times falſe Prophets ſhall ariſe, working great ſigns and wonders, able to deceiue, if it were poſsible, euen the verie elect: when as Antichriſt 2. Theſſ. 2. 9. 
                     the man of ſinne ſhall come, whoſe coming ſhall be by the effectuall working of Sathan with all power and ſignes, and lying wonders: with deceiueableneſſe of vnrighteouſneſſe among them that periſh, becauſe they receiued not the loue of the truth, that they might be ſaued: therefore God ſhall ſend them ſtrong deluſions to beleeue lies. In the which ſo terrible a ſtorme, our ſafeſt maner of beliefe will be (as we haue learned by Chriſts words) 
                        Matth. 24. 
                     not to beleeue them: which is the conſtant profeſſion of M. Non eſt miraculis fidendum quae fieri aut mentiuntur, aut verè praedicant, ſed ſoli doctrinae Chriſti & Apoſtolorum.

Secondly, Xauerius himſelfe writ many bookes of epiſtles out of India, concerning his proceedings in the cauſe of religion, whereof he directed ſome to Ignatius Loyola the Father of the ſocietie of Ieſuits, and others to other of his familiars, not ſparing vpon occaſion to report a wonder of In hac inſula Amboino rem vidi incredibilem, & ante hoc tempus inauditam—caprum lacte ſuo haedos alentem paruos.—Ego ipſe rem perſpexi his oculis, neque enim aliter. vt crederem, adduci potuiſſem.

Thirdly, albeit we are verie inclinable to beleeue that for the conuerſion of infidels vnto the faith, God might & did vouchſafe to make viſible vnto them thoſe

                     We worke no wonders, we effect no miraculous worke, neither (ſaith he) is this neceſſarie.
                  
                  4 Which is not therefore produced by vs to the preiudice of the power of Gods grace (farre be that height of blaſphemie from vs!) but that we may vnderſtand the truth of Gods proceedings, who hath neither need of Miracles for the conuerſion of infidels, nor of lies for confirmation of his faithfull.

                     the queſtion which many make, why in this age in the cōuerſion of the Indians there appeareth not the power of Miracles, as well as it did in Terra florida, where foure men, and by profeſsion ſoldiers, hauing the miraculous gift of healing, and leading a ſanctified life, were ſo admired of the Barbarians, that they were almoſt honoured for Gods; and why ſhall God now withdraw his omnipotent hand, which he extended vpon the Engliſh in their conuerſion, ſeeing that all England is ſcarce to be accounted one houſe to a great citie, if it be compared with that part of the world, which hath bene lately diſcouered?
                  
                  
                     
6 He anſwereth firſt out of S. Auguſtine, that Mihi verò illud Auguſtini opportunè occurrit, qui cùm commemorâſſet paulò antè diuinam vocationem interdum externis ſignis, aliquando interno pulſu fieri; mox adiungit: Haec autem vocatio quae ſiue in ſingulis hominibus, ſiue in populis, atque in ipſo genere humano per temporum oportunitates operatur, altae & proſundae operationis eſt.—Cui rei non diſſimile mihi videtur, quòd Eccleſiam ſuam olim in ipſis Euangelij cunabulis, multorum ſignorum & variorum chariſmatum copia congregauerit, eandem modò de Gentibus non minus mirab

                     God conuerteth men ſometimes by outward ſignes, and ſometimes by inward inſpirations; but when, and whom he will conuert by either of theſe meanes, ſtandeth in the vnſearchable wiſedome of Gods ordinance: who, when the Church was but in the cradle, did call men by mighty Miracles to the faith of the Goſpell, & now doth no leſſe maruellouſly conuert men without multitudes of Miracles, gouerning diuerſe times by the diuerſe lawes of his wiſedome.
                  
                  7 Secondly, he giueth a reaſon of this difference: Mihi quidem aliquoties iſta animo repetenti, tam perſpicuae diuerſitatis in poteſtate ſignorum, illa occurrere cauſa ſolet, quòd priſcis temporibus omninò neceſſaria fuerint, noſtris non item.

                     When Grecians and Romanes (ſaith he,) men learned in all humane wiſdome, and who ſtood vpon the termes of naturall reaſon, were to be brought vnto Chriſt, it ſeemed vnto almightie God a thing conuenient, that the conuerters, being but ſimple and vnlearned men, ſhould be furniſhed with diuine power of working Miracles, which exceeded all naturall meanes, as S. Paul ſignifieth in himſelfe. But there is not the like reaſon of ſuch wonderous works now among theſe people, who are euery way inferiour vnto their conuerters, in wit, iudgement, and all naturall endowments, and whatſoeuer other outward facultie, which may auatle for perſwaſion. And therefore in concluſion, he wiſheth in Chriſtian conuerters but Denique quid magnorum ſignorum confirmatione opus eſt, vbi potius deſideratur acutior intelligentia, quae altitudinem noſt

                     conformity of a godly life with their Christian faith; which (ſaith he) would be of it ſelfe, indeed, a moſt ſingular Miracle, moſt powerfull and ſuccesfull for the conuerting of infidels vnto the faith.
                  
                  8 If this be ſo in thoſe parts of India, wherein this their Acoſta hath bene ſo long conuerſant, we ſee no reaſon there ſhould be ſo great difference of the other parts of India before mentioned. For as it is forbidden in Scripture to ſay, that 3. Reg 20. 28. 
                     God is the God of the vallies, and not of the mountaines: ſo may it ſeeme inconſonant for men, to attribute ſo much power of miraculous grace vnto the Eaſt, and ſo little to the Weſt. And although the experience of Gods working muſt confound all reaſoning of man, yet ſeeing the credit which man hath thereunto, doth depend vpon the fidelitie of man the reporter, it is requiſite that euerie ſuch report containe it ſelfe within the compaſſe of due intelligence.
                  9 Howſoeuer, this argument of Miracles wrought among infidels doth not inferre an vndoubted difference of Chriſtian profeſſors amongſt themſelues, both becauſe Chryſoſtomus, Hieronymus, Euthymius & Theophylactus probant multis exemplis, etiam per homines inſideles vera miracula facta eſſe.—Et ex hoc loco (Matth. 7. 22) facilè colligitur, falſos iſtos prophetas, de quibus Chriſtus loquitur, vera miracula facturos, verè prophetâſſe, verè Daemonia eieciſſe: nec enim reſpondit Chriſtus mentiri eos; ſed, quamuis ita fecerint, ſe eos non nôſſe.

                  10 We ſhall need no more for this preſent point in queſtion, for vnderſtanding, that among them who profeſſe the ſame faith of Chriſt (albeit not with equall truth and ſinceritie) the leſſe ſincere parties may worke Miracles, whereunto God concurreth by his omnipotent power; but not for proofe of the errours, which are proper vnto themſelues, but for the confirmation of the truth, which with them is common to the Church.
                  11 Therefore in Miracles, which the Apologiſts haue obiected, we diſſtinguiſh betweene the Apoſtolicall truth, which they with vs do profeſſe, and their intermixed adherent corruptions: and may grant, that God doth cooperate by them to the conuerſion of infidels, ſo farre as the Goſpell of Chriſt, which is the 
                        Rom. 1. 16. 
                     power of God to ſaluation, is preached by them: and not for the approbation of the leauen of their other ſuperſtitions. Hitherto then there can be no aduantage gained by their pretence of Miracles, wherein
                  
                     THE ROMISH APOLOGISTS do further inſtance, in the times of S. Bernard.

Iewell in his defence of the Apologie, printed 1571. pag. 557. paulò ante med. confeſſeth ſaying, S. Bernard liued in the middeſt of the Popes rout and tyranny. Wherupon it followeth, that for ſo much as neither of them is found to haue bene troubled for any one point of doctrine diſagreeing from thoſe times, but were to the contrary, both of thhem in high fauour as then with the Romane Sea, the one of them being the Popes Legate, the other an Abbot, that therefore they were agreeable in religion to the profeſſed doctrine of thoſe times: ſo improbably do our aduerſaries pretend S. Bernard to haue bene a member of their Church, for his onely then zealous reprouing the corruption of life and manners in the Clergie of that age.

                  12 The Apologiſts ſay in their text, that they could adde many great Miracles wrought of latter times, to omit ſundrie others wrought by Malachias, and S. Bernard. And their notes of 2. and 3. directing vs vnto their intent in the margent, ſhew that all thoſe great Miracles of latter times are no other then thoſe which they pretend to omit, euen the Miracles attributed vnto Malachias and S.

                     Merit, and other articles. Whether (we ſay) our Apologiſts would allow in S. Bernard, by the vertue of his Miracles, theſe and ſuch like his opinions, they ought to anſwer; but haply will not, becauſe whether they grant this, or denie it, they muſt fall into their owne ſnare. For if the gift of Miracles doth warrant the worker in all his doctrines, then how ſhall our Aduerſaries iuſtifie their diſſent from him? But if that miraculous power do not patronize all the religion of the profeſſor, then cannot this be any demonſtration of the truth of all their religion.

                     Miracles are not wrought by Images amongſt them who profeſſe the Christian faith: can it ſtand with the modeſtie of our Aduerſaries, for want of Miracles wrought perſonally by men, to betake themſelues wholy vnto Miracles wrought by Images: as their Turſellin. hiſt. de

                     But yet ere that a yeare came to an end, by reaſon of a diſſention which couetouſneſſe, in ſharing the ſacred offerings, did kindle betweene them, it was cauſed to forſake that hill, and to chooſe another hard by, where euer ſince it hath continued.
                  
                  Here, indeed, is a Miracle, if it were true, worthie the pen of a fift Euangeliſt; but if falſe, vnworthie the monuments of verie Pagans.

                     Although this be a matter wonderfull and vnheard of (ſaith Turſelline,) yet is it ſo certaine and tried, that it were impietie in any to doubt thereof; becauſe it was receiued by faithfull

                     wherein we find that at the firſt remoue thereof into Dalmatia, the people of Illyria ſent meſſengers into Galilie to trie the place and foundation it had, and the iuſt proportion, and found it to be agreeable. After that Beatae Mariae monitu per ſomnum Eremita, (cuius nomen non proditur) qui obteſtabatur B.

                     a deuout Eremite, (whoſe name was not reuealed) came to worſhip at Lauretto, and praied vnto the bleſſed Virgin concerning that houſe, beſeeching her to manifeſt by ſome euidence, from whence it was: ſhe being ouercome by his praters, admoniſhed him in a dreame to moue the people of Picenum to ſend meſſengers into Dalmatia, and into Galilie to inquire of the truth of the matter: and fifteene meſſengers were ſent, who auouched all to be true.

But we demand who are witneſſes of theſe witneſſes? we meane, what ancient hiſtories haue recorded the truth of ſo admirable a Miracle?

For how ſhall we be perſwaded the houſe would make choiſe of the countrie of Italie, when the whole nation was rent into two moſt extreme factions, ſeeing it could not endure to ſtay vpon a little hill, becauſe of the diſſention of but two brethren? or thinke that it would forſake a wood, becauſe it was an harbour of theeues, & yet ſtill remaine in Italy, which was and is a patroneſſe of ſtewes? or that after the triall of eye-witneſſes, they ſhould not be able to diſcerne whether it was a whole Sunt qui non tam domum quim cubiculum putent à caetera ſeiunctum domo.

I ſay, we omit this as being vnſauory in it ſelfe, and preiudiciall vnto their owne Churches in France and Rome itſelfe: for whenſoeuer miracles are vndertaken, and haue not bene effected, it was for want of faith either in the workers, or in the beholders. And will our aduerſaries thinke the Prieſts and people of Rome defectiue in their faith?

                     ſeeing this tranſlation is ſaid to haue hapned about the yeare of our Lord 1296, it is not credible that Petrarke, Boccace, Antonius, (and others) who liued within the compaſſe of an hundred yeares after, and were famous in their times, writing purpoſely of the miracles & wonders done in that age, ſhould haue omitted this.
                  
                  21 Secondly, that Vincentius a Spaniard (who liued about the yeare 1459, and whom the Romanists call a Saint,) intreating of Pilgrimage, ſaith, that men and women in going on pilgrimage breake their necks, and become worſe; for ſometime going out chaſt, they returne deſiled: let vs therfore (ſaith he) vndertake a ſpirituall pilgrimage, which is (as the Apostle teacheth) to liue in the ſpirit, and walke in the ſpirit: to day, and euerie day you may go vnto Nazareth, vnto the place where the ſonne of God was incarnate, as alſo vnto other holy places. Where we may obſerue that he would neuer haue vſed this tenour of ſpeech, to ſay, that men might daily go (meaning in ſpirit) vnto Nazareth, vnto the houſe where our Lord was incarnate, if at that time when he writ, the houſe and Nazareth had bene a thouſand miles diſtant.
                  22 How then ſhall we giue credit vnto ſuch ſtories as do pretend ſufficient euidence of ancient records, and can ſhew none, but do leaue the report very proportionable and ſemblable vnto the houſe, which they feine to haue ſtood without it owne foundation?
                  
                  23 Finally, this deuiſed Miracle ſmelleth too much of an heatheniſh forge, reported by c Plinie, of the Temple of Diana, which was (ſaith he) remoued out of the Iſle Zazyn thus vnto Saguntum in Spaine. We paſſe from this vnto others.

                  That the greateſt ſecuritie of a Chriſtian ſtandeth in not affecting or beleeuing Miracles, which are ſuggeſted in theſe latter times for confirmation of any truth.
                  SECT. 5.
                  34 Albeit our Sauiour, (who is the right hand of the Father) had manifeſted himſelfe to be the ſonne of God by ſo euident wonders, that it was a ſinne against the holy Ghoſt to denie them; and that from his fulneſſe of power his Apoſtles and other holy men in the Churches infancie and growth had receiued the gift of Miracles, the ſcales of faith: yet conſidering, firſt from Scriptures, that Chriſt hath prophecied of the latter times of a generall apoſtaſie from the faith by 
                        Matth 24. 24. 
                     great wonders, able to deceiue, if it were poſsible, the verie elect: eſpecially thoſe, who 2. Theſſ. 29. 10. 11. 
                     would not receiue the loue of the truth, and through an effectall working of Sathan in lying wonders, and ſtrong deluſions ſhall be brought to beleeue lies.
                  
                  35 In which conſideration our Lord Chriſt hath preſcribed vnto all true beleeuers a caution or antidote of 
                        See aboue cap. 17. §. 3. 
                     not beleeuing them, as the onely pr

                     ſeruatiue againſt all ſuch intoxications, as aboue from See ibid. Fathers and our Aduerſaries themſelues hath bene plentifully proued. May we not then iuſtly demand, which profeſſors are like beſt to beare the brunt of Antichriſts tyranny, and to auoid the generall apoſtaſie, which ſhal be wrought by the ſeducement of lying, but ſtrange wonders? whether the Proteſtants who being contented with the truth reuealed in the word of God, do Luther and Caluine. See aboue. condemne all triall by Miracles in theſe latter times, or the Romaniſts, who ſtill maintaine

the viſible power and gift of Miracles to be the perpetuall badge of true Religion.
                  36 Secondly, not onely See aboue. 
                     true Miracles haue bene wrought by falſe profeſſors (although for confirmation of a Chriſtian truth,) but that alſo falſe wonders may be ſo called, becauſe they are either a falſo, or ad falſum, that is, either wrought by falſe cauſes, or vnto falſe purpoſes, ſo that they can be Difficile erit (viz. tempore Antichriſti) diſcernere vera ſigna à falſis, vbi multa & magna erunt, & veris ſimillima.

                     hardly diſcerned (ſaith their Ieſuite Acoſta) being moſt like vnto true. Inſomuch as their Mendacia erunt ratione materiae, quia erunt phantaſtica & praeſtigiae,—& per illuſiones. Proptereà dicitur Apoc. 13. Antichriſtus facturus miracula in conſpectu hominū, i. deludentia conſpectum hominum, vt Arethas notauit.—Deinde licet vera ſunt ratione formae, quia interdum res veras operabit
                           •
                        r▪ ſed quae non ſuperabunt vires totius naturae, & ideo non vera miracula erunt formaliter, quae à ſolo Deo fiunt,—& vera ſunt non ſolùm in conſpectu hominum, ſed etiam Angelorum. Bellar. lib. 3. de Rom. Pont. ca. 15. §. Deinde. 
                     materiall cauſes are falſe (as ſaith their Cardinall) when fantasticall ſhadowes are preſented in ſtead of bodies, yet ſuch mens eies are deceiued; ſometime the formall cauſe is falſe, when by naturall, but ſecret cauſes, he worketh ſtrange effects. Which men miſtake as proceeding from diuine power, when as indeed they are rather wonders of mans ignorance, then workes of Gods omnipotencie. So likewiſe may men be deluded by falſe & feined pretences, wherwith the Diuell perſwadeth ſome to faſt and to vſe godly exerciſes, with a ſecret & hidden purpoſe to draw them into a ſpirituall preſumption; ſo that both in the manner, and in the end of his ſpirituall working, in a transfigured Angell there may be hidden an vndiſcernable Satan.
                  37 He therefore that will diſtinguiſh of true profeſſors, muſt warily and religiouſly obſerue what ſide is more prone to deceiue and be deceiued by falſe Miracles, and iudge accordingly: and then recognize that the profeſſion of Proteſtants is an abandoning of the neceſſity of Miracles for confirmation of their Apoſtolike faith, which was ſufficiently confirmed by the Miracles of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and now needeth no new ſeales to be added vnto it.
                  38 Contrariwiſe we haue obſerued in our Aduerſaries a palpable proneneſſe to be deluded by new apparitiōs (which is the road-way of all errors, as the Fathers haue ſaid) and alſo by forged or miſconceiued Miracles full of impoſtureſhip. And how ſhould it be otherwiſe? For where the ſpirit of aequiuocating is predominant, teaching people to deceiue men in their oathes for the ſecuring of their perſons, and from freeing their cauſe from ſcandall, how ſhal they not hold it expediēt to vſe the ſame art in their Miracles, for gaining (as they thinke) ſoules vnto God? And then may we iudge, whether profeſſion is leſſe obnoxious vnto the Antichriſtian apoſtaſie, which ſhall be wrought by pretence of Miracles, either through the raritie of the maruels, or elſe by the ſtupiditie of the marueller.
                  39 For this we all know, that after the faith once receiued, it is the more 
                        Matth. 12.

                     ALL that hitherto hath bene diſcuſſed by theſe obiectors, concerning the faith of Britons, Grecians, Armenians, orthodoxall Fathers, or Iewes, hath aimed at this one ſcope, viz. the iuſtifying of the now Romane faith: and now after the viſitation of the faith of other nations and perſons, they retire themſelues vnto their home, being willing that we ſhould examine the now Romiſh faith in the Romiſh Church it ſelfe, and in thoſe whom they account to haue bene the late profeſſed members thereof, and begin (as we ſee) with his Maieſties

                  3 And this conſideration of that our Eccleſiaſtes or Preacher, cannot but worthily condemne the Apologiſts of a partiall preiudice, who chooſe rather to be informed cōcerning that Sermon by (as they confeſſe) a reprochfull traducer and libeller, then (which they might eaſily haue done) by the teſtimonies of a thouſand temperate and indifferent hearers▪ then preſent.

Councels, correcting other precedēt ones in theſe great points of conſubſtantialitie, of the two diſtinct natures in Chriſt, of rebaptization, of worſhipping of Images. Our next poſition is,
               
               
                  That it is poſsible for ſome to be ſaued, who are members of an vnſound Church.
                  SECT. 3.
                  4 The beliefe of ſome articles are ſo abſolutely neceſſarie for the conſtitution of a true Church, as a reaſonable ſoule is for the eſſentiall being of a man: ſuch as concerne the knowledge of the vnitie of the Godhead, and the Trinitie of perſons, together with the true and faithfull apprehenſion of the natures of Chriſt the Meſſias, God and man; the power of his death and reſurrection, by which we haue remiſſion of ſins, and after death life euerlaſting. For when the Apoſtle writ againſt idolatrous worſhippers of Angels, he maketh their caſe deſperate, but why? Non tenentes caput, becauſe they hold not the 
                        Coloſſ. 2. 19. 
                     head Chriſt.
                  5 Wherefore we preſume, that in a Church, although corrupted with error and ſuperſtition, yet if it do not ruinate the foundatiō, the erroneous & ſuperſtitious profeſſors may be ſaued: euen by the vertue of that tenor which is in capite, viz. Chriſt Ieſus, the Lord and author of life. Which notwithſtanding we muſt ſo vnderſtand, as that the error & ſuperſtition do proceede not from knowledge, but from ignorance; which ignorance is not affected, but ſimple, by that ſimplicity of heart, that is both deſirous to know & profeſſe the truth

of God, & void of confidence of his own perfection, crauing pardon for ſins both of ignorance and of preſumption, and flying vnto the iuſtice of faith, which is the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt for iuſtification by him.

                  7 Yet farre be it from vs ſo to preſume of the ſimple, or rather ſottiſhignorance, as their Ieſuite Tolet hath done, who in his booke of inſtructions for Prieſts, teacheth, that Rurſus, ſi ruſticus circa articulos eredat ſuo Fpiſcopo proponenti aliquod dogma haereticum, meretur in credendo, licet ſit error, quia tenetur credere, donec ei conſtet eſſe contra Eccleſiam. Tolet. Ieſ. Inſtruct. Sacerd. lib. 4. cap. 3. §. In ſumma. 
                     if a rurall man, and ignorant of the articles of ſaith, ſhall beleeue an hereticall doctrine, which his Biſhop ſhall teach him, he (ſaith Tolet) doth merit by thus beleeuing, becauſe he is bound to beleeue it, vntill he perceiue it to be contrary vnto the Church. Neuer was this doctrine of rurall ſimplicitie taught by ancient Fathers, or (as we thinke) by any of their followers, before this preſent time. For what? Is any one bound to beleeue any man preaching an heriticall doctrine? 
                     
                        •

                     although we, or an Angell from heauen, ſhall preach vnto you otherwiſe then that which we haue preached vnto you, let him be accurſed: and ſheweth that mans conſcience is bound not to whom, but to what, that is, to beleeue onely a truth, although it were taught by the Diuell; and not any perſon preaching hereſie, although he ſhould be an Angell from heauen. But that alſo ſuch a beleeuer of hereſie ſhould merit of God by his erroneous faith, this ſeemeth to exceed all boūds of Chriſtian instruction: for ſo ſimplicitie in e

                  8 Notwithſtanding, in this error of the Ieſuite there is inuolued a peece of truth, viz. that ſome man intangled in hereſie, by reaſon of his ſimplicitie in erring (if otherwiſe he haue faith in the Sonne of God) may be capable of grace. To conclude, the obſeruable points of this poſition, (to wit,) that any

liuing in an vnſound Church may be capable of life, are theſe. 1. If he deſtroy not any maine foundation of faith. 2. If the erroneous haue not had a former illumination of truth, from the which (by want of loue to practize it) he is become an apoſtate. Of ſuch an one the Apoſtle hath pronounced, that he is giuen vp to 2. Theſſ. 2. 11. 
                     beleeue lies, and his caſe is in a ſort deſperate. 3. If the ignorant be prepared to know and acknowledge the ſauing truth. 4. If he haue no confidence of meriting and deſeruing grace by his ſimple and vnaffected ignorance, but in humilitie of his ſoule pray for forgiueneſſe. Vpon this followeth a third poſition
               
               
                  That although not all vnſound Churches, yet ſome are ſafely to be forſaken.
                  SECT. 4.
                  9 Vnſoundneſſe of a Church hapneth either in maners, or in doctrine. The licence which ſome vſe, to rent the coate of Chriſt by taking offence at the wicked liues of the Paſtors and profeſſors in the Church, is repreſſed by our Sauiours ſpeech; 
                        Matth. 23. 3. 
                     All whatſoeuer they bid you obſerue, that obſerue and do, but after their works do not, for they ſay, but do not. The corrupt life of the worſhipper cannot defile the worſhip which God himſelfe hath ordained and ſanctified.
                  10 Secondly, euerie corrupt cuſtome vſed in the publike worſhip of God, doth not immediatly enforce a ſeparation from that Church, except the cuſtome be in it ſelfe idolatrous: for we reade how

                  11 Thirdly, if the corruption be doctrinall, this may be conſidered either as it is vniuerſally held, or but either by a leſſe or more common expoſition. In this ſecond reſpect there can be no iuſt cauſe of diuiſion, as the abouenamed examples of the 
                        See aboue Sect. 2. Churches of the Iewes, Corinth, Galatia, Epheſus, Thiatyra, and Sardis do warrant vs. God may not be forſaken, becauſe the diuell ſtandeth at his left hand; the Lords barne muſt not be ſet on fire, becauſe of the chaffe; the fold of Chriſt his ſheepe muſt not be forſaken for the companie of goats, nor his net of ſound fiſhes broken, for the mixture of the putrified and corrupt. Abell may offer his ſacrifices with Cain, the penitent Publicane ſay his praiers with the Phariſee, Chriſts diſciples communicate with Iudas, euen then when they haue a ſigne that this is he, viz. who was guiltie of the higheſt treaſon that euer could be imagined. But when we ſhall find that the error of doctrine either concerning Gods worſhip or points of faith, is generall, and not onely in the profeſſion (that man may retaine a libertie

of not allowing it) but alſo in preſcription & exaction; thē is the doore opened for 
                        Apoc. 13. 4.

Cor. 11. 3. & 1. Pet. 1. 2. & 1. Tim. 6. 4. & 2. Tim. 2. 17. Apoſtles. This point hath begot a fift, viz.
               
               
                  That the obiected teſtimonies of Proteſtants, for the auouching the truth of the Romiſh Church, do no more aduantage our Aduerſaries, then it may do any heretiks, who haue not directly deſtroyed the fundamentall points of faith.
                  SECT. 5.
                  12 If any ſhall but peruſe the ſame Treatiſes, from whence the fore-named teſtimonies haue bene borrowed, for proofe, that ſome dying in the vnitie of that Church, may be ſaued, he ſhall find them all proteſt againſt the doctrine and the worſhip which is commonly profeſſed & practized therein, as being in their iudgement idolatrous and Antichriſtian, and holding it a damnation to themſelues to conſent thereunto: but yet they (not daring to cloſe the armes of Chriſt, which were ſtretched out vpon the Croſſe to embrace all that without obſtinate blindneſſe of error in points of faith, or purpoſe of continuance in any knowne ſinne, ſhall with Thomas touch by faith the print of his ſides, and haue their conſciences dyed in his precious bloud) haue conceiued (as they ought) a ſaluation for ſuch, not onely in the Romiſh, but in other erroneous Churches; being taught not vtterly to deſpaire of that ſoule which doth not deſpaire of the mercie of God in Chriſt, but ſhall by faith (as the woman with the bloudie iſſue did)

                     all fulneſſe of the godhead dwelling in him bodily?
                  
                  13 And ſo much leſſe may we deſpaire of ſome of the members of the Romane Church, by how much more euident it is, that notwithſtanding they write in their bookes of a perfect iuſtification by inherent iuſtice, yet is not this radicall in their hearts: for by their practiſe at the houre of death, euen then when they preſume that they are to performe the act of Martyrdome, they, renouncing all confidence of their perfectneſſe, do caſt anchor, with vs, vpon the mercie of God in his Chriſt, and our Ieſus, for the full remiſſion of ſinnes.
                  14 Howſoeuer, the teſtimonies themſelues, and the reaſons which are annexed, do plainly ſhew, that the aboue-cited Proteſtants yeeld no more ſecuritie vnto the Romiſh Church, then they do vnto any other, wherein there is a true Baptiſme, and the profeſſion of the chiefeſt Principles of faith. Hereunto we annexe a ſixt poſition, viz.
               
               
                  That the Church of Rome is not properly the Catholike, but a particular Church: and is therefore as other Churches, ſubiect vnto errour.

                     the ſucceſſor of S. Peter, and vniuerſall Biſhop of the Church, was by the ordinance of Chriſt appointed to be the Biſhop of Rome, and not by any humane authority: yeelding in effect this conſequence, viz. if it were poſſible that the Papall authoritie might be tranſlated vnto ſome other dioceſſe, as vnto Antioch, or elſe-where, then could not the Church of Rome pretend any priuiledge of neuer erring from the true faith.

                     But the Biſhop of Rome (ſaith Cardinall Bellarmine,) was not appointed by Chriſt to be the ſucceſſor of S. Peter, as he was Biſhop of Rome: whence by due inference it will follow, that therfore the Romane Church, as it is the Romane Church, hath no ſpeciall prerogatiue that it ſhall neuer apoſtate from the faith. From this doth iſſue a ſeuenth poſition, viz.
               
               
                  That to be ſeparated from the communion of the Romiſh Church, is not in it ſelfe damnable: proued by the confeſſed examples of glorious and ancient Churches and Fathers.

                     If this ſtorie (ſaith he) confirmed by the Epiſtle of Pope Boniface & other ancient Records, be to be called into queſtion, then what haue we in all Eccleſiaſticall antiquitie certaine and vnquestionable for the confirmation of any matter which cencerneth the ſtate of the Church?
                  
                  23 From this ſpirit of contradiction, which hath thus poſſeſſed the principall Doctors of the Romiſh Church, our reader wil preſently obſerue, that if the Epiſtle be falſe, then all ſuch like Papall Eccleſiaſticall ſtories which are brought in for proofe of the Primacie of other Popes, may be as iuſtly ſuſpected (as Lindaneſheweth) to be meerely forged and foyſted ſtuffe. And if we ſhall admit it as true, then (as their Baronius argueth) all thoſe Africanes, whoſe names the Church hath recorded among the holy Confeſſors & Martyrs, muſt no more be called Martyrs, but ſchiſmaticks, and be iudged to be Cùm praeſertim certum exploratumue ſit, nullam eſſe poſſe ſchiſmaticorum coronam & praemiū, quae non—niſi dentur in Eccleſia Catholica—Cum ſi eius Bonifacij ſtare poſſet Epiſtola, corruere neceſſe eſſet ex ca parte Dei illam ſtructuram quae tot Martyrum & Confeſſorum viuis eſſet aucta lapidibus. Baronius quo ſuprà, num. 93. 
                     not crowned with bliſſe, but damned in hell; and all for the maintenance of the Papall prerogatiue.
                  24 Do we not now ſee into what a miſerable perplexitie our Aduerſaries

haue driuen themſelues? The one ſide defend the truth of that ſtorie, and had rather that multitudes of Martyrs ſhould be accounted reprobates, then ſo euident a teſtimonie for the Popes Primacie ſhould periſh: the other ſide, leſt that the example of thoſe orthodoxall Churches and worthie Martyrs who neglected the Popes communion, might preiudice his Primacie, do reiect the Popes Epiſtle as fabulous. The iſſue of all which will be this, that if the ſtory be falſe, then the principall euidences which our Aduerſaries vſually ſuggeſt, for proofe of the Papall Primacie, incurre the ſuſpicion of falſhood: and if the ſtorie be true, then muſt we either pronounce damnation vpon the ſoules of faithfull Martyrs, or elſe in ſome caſes contemne the Popes excommunication, and Romane communion.
                  25 But be this Epiſtle of Pope Boniface either true of falſe, this we know, that the vnqueſtionable See hereafter. ſtorie which they haue recorded in the bodie of their Councels, ſheweth plainly, that the Biſhops of Africke, among whom S. Auguſtine was principall actor, did reſolutely conclude and decree againſt the Popes claime of appeales vnto Rome. So that if after this the Pope did not excommunicate them, it was becauſe he then thought, that he had no ſuch authoritie: and this is no ſmall wound vnto the Primacie. But if they were therefore excommunicated, & notwithſtanding ſtill continued in that oppoſition, then the examples of ſo graue, learned, and holy Biſhops, and their ſucſeſſors, faithfull confeſſors and Martyrs (who for the hope of ſaluation yeelded vp their deareſ
                        •
                     liues, and are now acknowledged for Saints in glory) do all preach againſt the foreſaid principall article of the now Romiſh faith, which holdeth the ſubiection and vnion with the Pope of Rome, to be neceſſarie vnto ſaluation.
                  
                  26 Furthermore, if this article ſhall ſtand for credible, then no leſſe fearefull a doome muſt alſo ſeiſe vpon millions of ſoules, which haue for many ages died in the Greeke Church, which both anciently, and at this preſent are diuided from the Romane iuriſdiction, and are by our Aduerſaries called ſchiſmaticks euen at this day: but yet (as ſome of them affirme) Alij verò opinantur Graecos ſolùm eſſe ſchiſmaticos, non haereticos: Schiſmaticos quidem quia à Rom.

                     priuate conuent, the authoritie

whereof hath not bene fully acknowledged of the Romaniſts in France vntill this day.
                  29 By this any may perceiue what is the mercileſſe ambition of our Aduerſaries defence, who for the eſtabliſhing of the ſafetie of one only Romane Church, do peremptorily, not onely exclude all the Churches of Proteſtants in France, Germany, England, Scotland, Polonia, Denmarke, Heluetia, Hungarie, Sueuia, and other places, from all hope of life, but alſo, by the ſame conſequence, all the Aſian Churches, when they were watered with the bloud of glorious Martyrs; beſides many orthodoxall ſoules in other Churches (which haue bene at all times innumerable,) who haue not ſubiected themſelues vnto the Romane Papacie.
                  30 And now we referre this caſe vnto the wiſedome of our Chriſtian Reader, to iudge which profeſſors ſtand in more abſolute and Catholike vnion with Chriſtians; whether Proteſtants, who diſcerning betweene mens erros and their perſons, do ſo farre communicate in their hope with all Chriſtians, who liuing a godly life, do fundamentally profeſſe the faith of Chriſt: or the Romaniſts, who for the aduancement of one Church, do deliuer vp vnto Sathan, and vnto deſperation, all other Chriſtian Churches and Profeſſors in the world. This conſideration hath begotten an eight poſition, viz.
               
               
                  That the foreſaid pretence of neceſſarie Vnion with the Romane head and Church, will proue either the ſame Romane head or elſe the Romane Church to be ſchiſmaticall.

                  31 Now cometh in a conflict, wherein we find the Romane bodie and head, that is, a Councell and the Pope, like vnto Iacob and Eſau, ſtriuing for the birthright and preeminencie: Nos defendimus ſummum Pontificem ſimpliciter & abſolutè eſſe ſupra Eccleſiam vniuerſam, & ſupra Conc

                     We defend (ſaith Cardinall Bellarmine) that the Pope is abſolutely aboue the vniuerſall Church and generall Councell, not acknowledging any Iudge ouer him. And that Haec, quamuis nullo Decreto publico definita eſt, tacito tamen Doctorum conſenſu (vt aliae quaeſtiones in Eccleſia olim ortae non paucae) plané definita eſt, vix vno ampliùs doctiore Theologo aliam de hac re ſententiam tenente,—quàm Papam Concilio, veluti caput corpori, praeeſſe.

                     the Pope is aboue a Councell (ſaith D. Stapleton) it is now defined by the ſecret conſent of all Diuines, ſcarce any one holding the contrarie. But if any ſhould preferre the authoritie of a Councell before the iuriſdiction of the Pope, Qui Concilium vniuerſale Pontifice ſuperius faciunt, pugnant illi reuera (licet non aduertentes) cum certiſſima fide de D. Petri ac Rom. Pontificis in Eccleſia primatu. Gregorius de Valent. Analyſ. lib. 8. cap. 7. §. Atque hinc. pag. 87. col. 2. 
                     they (ſaith their Ieſuite Valentia) do thereby oppugne the vndoubted faith of the Primacie of the Pope.
                  
                  31 We doubt that this their doctrine, which is now ſo vniuerſall in that Church, will proue the Pope and his defendants to be ſchiſmaticall: for in the Councell of Baſil the caſe was thus collected out of S. Hierome & Auguſtine, & the two ancient Popes: viz. that it is neceſſarie Probatur authoritatibus Papam ſubeſſe Concilio, Si authoritas quaetitur (inquit Hieron.) orbis maior eſt vrbe.—Ex hinc ſi mater omnium fidelium eſt Eccleſia, Romanum etiam Pontificem in ſilium habet.

                  36 Here we haue it confeſſed, that there may be a coniunction internall, where notwithſtanding there is an externall excommunication, yea euen whileſt that the excommunicate perſons do continue in the defence of their

errors, though with an opinion that they maintaine onely a reuealed truth. How much more, we ſay not excuſable, but euen iuſtifiable is the cauſe of Proteſtants, who are able to auouch the neceſſity of their oppoſition to haue bene a defence of truth againſt noueltie of errors? Yea although we ſhall ſuppoſe it to haue bene only that one doctrine of Indulgences vpon an opinion of a treaſurie of ſatisfactions of the Saints, mixed with Chriſts merits for theredemption of mans ſoule from puniſhent after this life: which hath bene 
                        See aboue lib. 1 cit. 2.

                     Thoſe who are inſtructed in holy writ may not betray any one ſyllable of diuine doctrine, but muſt be readie rather to vndergo any death for the defence of truth. And what is this different from our Sauiours inſtruction, when he gaue his caueat of auoiding the 
                        Matth. 16. 
                     leauen of the Phariſees, that is, their corrupt doctrine, as it is expounded by the text?
                  37 When ſuch doctrines ſhall be enforced vpon mens conſciences, as are not doubtfully, but directly againſt the word of God, ſchiſme in ſuch a caſe is paſſiue, not actiue; and rather a ſeparation from errors, then a ſchiſme from the bodie, whereunto they are vnited both in ſpirit and loue, ſo farre as it is vnited vnto the truth of Chriſt.

                     I cannot denie (ſaith he) but that at the firſt many in godly zeale were moued vehemently to reprehend certaine manifeſt abuſes, and that the chiefe cauſe of this diſtraction may be imputed vnto the gouernours of the Church, who proudly and diſdainfully contemned thoſe who did both modeſtly and truly admoniſh them. Neither can we hope for a true and ſolid vnion, vntill they, who haue giuen the c
                           •
                        uſe of diſſention, begin to remit their rigorouſneſſe, & be contented that manifeſt abuſes of the Church be reformed according to the direction of Scripture, and the cuſtome of antiquitie, from whence they are departed. We wiſh no more, if by abuſes we ſhall vnderſtand as well their new doctrines, as their corrupt conſtitutions. There remaineth the tenth poſition, viz.
               
               
                  That the Proteſtants are more ſafe in this diuiſion, then the Romaniſts.
                  SECT. 10.
                  39 Nothing hath bene thought vnto ſome who haue 
                        M. Tob. M. vnto the Biſhop of Chicheſter: It is an argument borrowed from Bellar. lib. 4. de not is Eccleſ. cap. 16. and is here intended by the Apologiſts.
                      lately reuolted from the Churches of Proteſtants, a ſtronger or more ſenſible motiue, then to thinke that ſome Proteſtants haue iudged the Romane Church to be a Church, wherein ſome ſoules may be ſaued, eſpecially ſeeing that the Romaniſts do contrarily adiudge all men of differēt religiō, vnto eternal damnation.
                  40 But firſt, theſe wandring Planets neuer conſider that our Aduerſaries haue no whit the more truth, becauſe they haue leſſe charity, eſpecially ſeeing that hereby they aſwell damne the moſt gracefull Chriſtians of moſt ancient times, who (as hath bene See aboue. proued) haue ſealed the orthodoxe faith

with their bloud: as they do the different profeſſors at this day.
                  41 Secondly, they diſcerne not the impietie of this argument; as for example (for this one is pregnant,) S. Auguſtine, though he held the ſect of the Donatiſts damnable, yet deemed he ſome of them to be * capable of ſaluation, when notwithſtanding the Donatists themſelues held (as S. Auguſtine noteth) Donatiſtae Eccleſiam ex ſolis iuſtis conſtare volebant, & inde deducebant Eccleſiam viſibilē perijſſe de orbe terrarum, & in ſola Africa remanſiſſe, vt Aug docet de vnit. eccleſ. cap. 12. Bellar. de notis Eccleſ. cap. 9. Where he inſerreth that Proteſiants are of the ſame opinion. Which is proued to be falſe and the difference to be no leſſe then Church viſible and inuiſible, euen by his owne confeſſion. See hereafter where the h

                  42 Thirdly, the Anabaptists exclude Proteſtants and all different profeſſors f
                        •
                     om the hope of ſpirituall life, who are not of their phantaſtical anarchie and confuſion: yet do not Proteſtants iudge the ſtate of euerie Anabaptiſt to be ſo vtterly deſperate. What then? muſt therefore all Proteſtants turne Anabaptiſts? No: but euerie child of truth will follow her, not where peraduenture ſhe may be, but rather where he ſeeth her certaine & inuiolable reſidence & abode; alwaies remēbring how that our authors, knowing the fountaine of Gods grace to be bottomleſſe, durſt not couer with a ſtone of deſpaire the graues of thoſe, who being free from obſtinacie in errors, and from affectation of a ſtupid ignorance in the neceſſarie myſteries of ſaluation, with repentant hearts did die in the faith of Chriſt; and yet notwithſtanding iudged much of that religion in it ſelfe damnable, and accounted it a matter of damnation in themſelues, againſt their conſcience to embrace it: like as we thinke the plague (when it is in the rage) to be mortall: and although (by the mercy of God) all die not, who are infected therwith, yet all who will not tempt God, or do loue their owne ſafetie, will not willingly admit of ſuch companie, leſt they may be infected, and die.
                  43 Againe, Proteſtants haue a more ſtrong fort for their ſecuritie, whileſt as, beſides the euidence of truth in their profeſſion, they hold an inward vnitie with all the orthodoxall Churches of ancient times, whom Romane Biſhops ſecluded from their communion: and with all other Chriſtian profeſſors, who at this day not proſtituting themſelues in the filthineſſe of ſpirituall adulterie, do not ruinate the principall foundation of faith. Neither can our Aduerſaries iuſtly obiect vnto Proteſtants, obſtinacie in their oppoſition vnto the Romane Church, eſpecially if they ſhall but call to mind what their owne Caſar Imperator cum vrg

               THE ROMISH APOLOGIE.
               2 Secondly, as concerning now their like confeſſed examples, we will out of verie many alledge onely ſome few. It will not (we thinke) be denied but that our late SOVRAIGN
                     •
                   KING Henrie the eight, did after his breach with Rome, beleeue and maintaine the whole frame and ſubſtance of

                     ur now profeſſed Catholike faith, the article of the Popes Primacie onely excepted. To which end their owne author Sleidane ſaith of him: 
                  Sleydan in Engliſh, lib. 13. fol. 174. a. initio. He exiled the name of the Biſhop of Rome, but kept ſtill his doctrine. And M. Foxe ſaith accordingly: 
                  Foxe Acts Monum. pag. 1472. b. fine. He ſet forth, and by full conſent of Parliament eſtabliſhed the booke of ſixe articles containing the ſumme of Popiſh religion. And it is euident that he himſelfe in perſon, not onely as then diſputed,

                  Act. Monu. Pag. 598. b. poſt med. a valiant ſoldier and captaine of Chriſt: and the Church vnder the reigne of King Henry the eight, is by M. Foxe affirmed to be a true M.

                  THE PROTESTANTS APPEALE.
                  SECT. 1.
                  
                     TWO things are herein verie conſiderable, to wit, what the Apologiſts do grant, and what they denie. They grant that King Henrie the eight did diſclaime the article of the Popes Primacie, but denie that he entertained any other forme of ſubſtantiall doctrine, vntill the laſt ſurrender of his ſpirit vnto God, except this onely article of Papall Primacie. And as though he had repented him of this oppoſition, they alledge teſtimonies concerning his proteſtation at his death, which neither are to be 
                        Their allegatiō at the number (7) out of M. Foxe and M. Holli
                           •
                        
                        ſhed, printed Anno 1586. (for they here name no edition, nor mention him in their catalogue of authors) hath not theſe teſtimonies.
                      found, nor yet (if by Catholike be meant a Romaniſt) can they agree with other ſuch hiſtories, which either Proteſtants or Romaniſts wil approue.
                  
                     
2 Let vs allow what the Apologiſts haue ſaid, King Henrie excepted againſt the Popes Primacie, which he did both in matters temporall (as the acts ſhew) and alſo in cauſes Eccleſiaſticall, as is plaine by the queſtion of diuorce. Seeing then that the name Papist is a denomination of Papa, the Pope, whoſe ſupreme authoritie ouer Kings, and infallibilitie of iudgement, in preſcribing decrees vnto the Church, are profeſſed at this day by our Aduerſaries as the two eſſentiall parts of that article of his Primacie, without which they pronounce all men to be See aboue. 
                     without hope of ſaluation: the caſe is plaine, that the King denying Papam, was nothing leſſe then a Papiſt.
                  
                  3 Neither was he alone in this, but the whole ſtate of the land, as well Eccleſiaſticall as temporall, conſented vnto the ſame renūciation of the Popes ſupremacie: and therefore could not but be liable vnto the ſame ſentence of excommunication, which Pope Paulus the third publiſhed and denounced againſt Praeterea ſub excōmunicationis poena mandamus, ne vllus Princeps Chriſtianus dicto Henrico Regi Anghae, eius nominis octauo, aut eius fautoribus &c. Bulla Pauli 3. lib. c

                  4 But if this had bene the onely article which the King defended (as the Apologiſts auouch) then did the Popes Bull runne wild, when in tenour of excommunication it Inſupet Principibus praedictis, alijſue quibuſcunque perſonis in virtute ſanctae obedientiae mandantes, vt aduerſus Regem ciuſue fautores, dum in erroribus praedictis permanſerint, armis inſurgant.

                     commanded the fore-named Princes, and all other perſons to take armes against the King and his fauourers, as long as they continued in the foreſaid errors. Belike then this error was not onely. Otherwiſe how could Alphonſus de Caſtro, in his preface dedicated vnto Philip late king of Spain, haue commended his highneſſe, becauſe Tu curâſtivt regnum illud (ſpeaking of England) quod plu quàm vigints annos à fide Catholica defecerat, ad eādem reduceretur.

                     after the defection of the kingdome of England, for the ſpace of twentie yeares and more, from the Catholike faith, he had againe reduced it vnto the ſame faith, except they ſhall ſay that the Popes Primacie is the onely article of their different faith?

Cranmer, to receiue ſpirituall comfort from him. Matthew Parker writeth, that by his meanes Henricus Rex profligato iam Papâ, eiectâ Monachorum & fratrum impurâ turbâ, tum promulgato per regnum Euangelio, moritur &c. Matth. Parkerus antiq. Britan. pag. 338. 
                     the Papall power was baniſhed, the Monaſticall ſrie of impuritie aboliſhed, the Goſpell publiſhed: and before his death, he appointed the Earle of Hereford, whom he had created Duke of Some

                     not ſuffer publike praiers to be ſaid for his ſoule, becauſe he died an excommunicate from the Church. Doubtleſſe if he had had contrition for his breach with Rome, he would haue ſought an abſolution from ſome Romane Prieſt. They proceed yet further in their perſonall argument.

                     Herode and Pilate were made friends, and Christ was cruciſied; and from the moſt bitter bitterneſſe of his ſoule crying out of the inward and incurable plague of the Church, and the corruption thereof in manners; the rage whereof he found to be ſo violent, that he ſaid (ſpeaking of the Prelates of the Church) they were Miniſters of Chriſt, but yet ſerued Antichriſt. It is a gracious bleſſing to be godly, but to be a Lot in Sodome, and a lillie among thornes, that is, a

godly man in a generall inuaſion of all vices, ſuch an one is glorious, and may well challenge the title of Saint.

Bernard writing vnto a Biſhop concerning this caſe, told him (which is confeſſed to be likewiſe the doctrine of other Fathers) that the order which God hath ſet, is, Omnis anima ſubiecta ſit &c.] Id eſt, ſiue Propheta, ſiue Apoſtolus, ſiue Epiſcopus, ſubditus ſit.

                     that euerie ſoule, euen of the Apoſtles, doth owe ſubiection; adding that he that ſhould endeuour to except him, did indeed but tempt him. And when he conſidered the Popedome to ſwell by reaſon of the commixture of Popedome and Princedome, he ſaid freely vnto the Pope, that the Apoſtolis interdicitur dominatus: ergo tu & tibi vſurpare aude aut dominans Apoſtolatum, aut Apoſtolicus Dominatum.

                  That Proteſtants in their liues, haue deſerued the name of ſanctitie; which is tried by the cenſures of their Romiſh Aduerſaries.

                     There are many wicked among vs Catholicks (ſaith he,) but among Proteſtants there is not one good. How ſhall this appeare? For firſt their Ieſuite Maldonate confeſſeth an outward practiſe of Caluiniſtae ouinâ pelle induti, nihil enim in eorum ore niſi Pater noſter coeleſtis, niſi Chriſtus, niſi fides, iuramentum inauditum, nihil in eorum factis apparebat niſi eleemoſynae, niſi temperantia, niſi modeſtia.

                     How ſhall the religion of the Proteſtants not be thought to be from God, ſeeing it had ſo many profeſſors in ſo ſhort a time? doth anſwer, that it is no maruell, alledging, among other reaſons, becauſe (ſaith he) they couer themſelues with ſheeps cloathing, and do behold the wickedneſſe of our liues. Which cannot but argue, at leaſt, an outward holineſſe. We therefore demaund of their Cardinall, How he will haue man iudged? If by the ſight into mens inward ſoules? then ſhal they neuer be able to proue any man without a Miracle to be a Saint. But if the examination of their outward behauiours be ſufficient arguments, why did he pronounce, that among Proteſtants there is not one good, and yet did acknowledge ſo many outward works of godlineſſe?

                  M. Some in his foreſaid defence, &c. cap. 22. page 165. & 167.

                  M. Some ibidem, p. 167. were baptiſed by popiſh ſhauelings, yet they receiued true baptiſme, and were ingraffed into Chriſt, and for this reaſon, becauſe there is a Church in poperie: for (ſaith he)

                  THE PROTESTANTS APPEALE.
                  SECT. 1.
                  
                     THis reaſon is wrought with excellent ſubteltie, and is indeed the moſt ſpecious obiection that can be found in their whole booke: the connexion whereof may be thus comprized. If Romiſh children be within the couenant of grace, by reaſon of the

faith of their parents, then the parents themſelues are within that couenant, and in the ſtate of ſaluation; and conſequenly the Romiſh doctrine is confeſſed by Proteſtants to be the Catholike and ſauing faith. Which concluſion is thus made contrary vnto the intention of the alledged authors, contrarie vnto the inſtance which may be taken from our Aduerſaries their owne doctrine, and contrarie to the light of common experience. Firſt,
                  2 All the Proteſtant authors aboue-cited, diſtinguiſh the ſtate of the children of the Pagane and infidell parents from the children of all ſects of Chriſtians, whether they be Papiſts or Anabaptiſts, or whatſoeuer other heretikes, if that the parents themſelues haue bene once by baptiſme, in the faith of the holy Trinitie, dedicated vnto Chriſt: by vertue of the which couenant and ſtipulation with God (wherein the children of all Chriſtians are comprized) it cometh to paſſe, that the child is onely intereſted in that part of the couenant, which is ſound and Catholike; whileſt as the parents themſelues ſtand guiltie of hereſies, which by their owne proper and actuall conſent, they haue added vnto the truth.
                  3 Now then the Apologiſts by their inference from their alledged confeſſions of Proteſtants, haue gained no more aduantage then the Anabaptiſts, or (if they be not fundamentally hereticall) then other heretiks may obtaine. Thus is this threede broken, which they haue ſo curiouſly and artificially ſpunne. But yet, becauſe of their great confidence which they ſixe vpon this ſpeculation, we owe them a ſecond ſatisfaction from their owne Principles.
                  4 For, Cardinall Tolet thinketh it a matter probable, that in ſome caſe b Baptiſmi miniſter neceſſitatis—poteſt eſſe homo cuiuſcunque vitae, ſiue Iudaeus, ſiue Paganus, ſiue alius quiuis infidelis, &c.—tamen omnibus eſt neceſſaria intentio debita faciendi id, quod facit Eccleſia, vti diximus, Vnde, licet infidelis non crederet ſe quicquam boni facere, & cum irriſione faceret, ſi tamen ad petitionem baptizandi baptizaret, intendens facere id quod facit Eccleſia Chriſtiana—verè baptizaret. Tolet. Ieſ. Inſtruct. Sacerd. lib. 2. cap. 20. pag 377, 378. an 
                        An praeciſus, qualis eſt haereticus aut ſchiſmaticus, poſſit abſoluere in articulo mortis? Si caſus accideret, quòd non eſſet periculum deſperationis, aut ſeductionis, non eſt improbabile quod affirmant,—poſſe, nempe, abſolui ab haeretico aut ſchiſmatico, quando ſcandalum non eſſet. Communis tamen opinio eſt in contrarium. Tolet. Ieſ. Inſtruct. Sacerd. lib. 1. ca. 15. §. Sextò non. 
                     hereticke or a ſchiſmaticke may giue abſolution: but they will not ſay, that any Pagane or infidell can abſolue any ſinner. Here then we ſee that the pa
                        •
                     
                     tie abſolued receiueth grace and remiſſion of ſinne, and yet the abſoluer, being an heretike, doth ſtill perſiſt in the ſtate of damnation. We demaund, whence is it, that the abſolution becometh ſo effectuall to the abſolued? is it onely by the power of his owne faith, or the outward forme of words? So the abſolution made by a Pagane ſhould haue bene as effectual, as that which was performed by an heretike. They muſt therefore confeſſe ſome abilitie in an heretike, (not as he is an heretik, but as he is a Chriſtian,) by vertue wherof the abſolution is made ſoueraigne vnto him that receiueth it: & conſequently grant, that a man may be cauſe of ſauing health vnto another by that his faith, which by reaſon of his admixture of hereſie, is damnable vnto himſelfe.
                  5 What ſhall we ſay of another Principle, which is generall in their Church? viz. In the caſe of neceſsitie, if a Pagane ſhall baptize one, it is a perfect baptiſme, although it be done in ſcorne; alwaies prouided, that in baptizing, he haue an intention to do that which the Chriſtian Church doth. Marke, here is a caſe of neceſſity, which is in the behalfe of the ſoule of a child, where a Pagan is held to be a ſufficiēt Miniſter of this ſacramēt; yet ſo, that he haue a Chriſtiā intent: which doth fully contradict the Apologiſts conſequence. For here, by their own doctrine, the intēt of a Pagan is auailable for the working of ſauing grace vnto the baptized, which intent of the Pagan is damnable to himſelfe.
                  6 Common experience, eſpecially in other nations, doth tell vs, that if a man, who is an infranchiſed or naturalized ſubiect, ſhall runne headlong into any actuall rebellion, and in this tranſgreſſion ſhall beget a ſonne, this

child, by the vertue of the fathers firſt naturalization, ſhall enioy the benefit of a ſubiect, and inherit his fathers lands. Wherein we may obſerue that the fathers firſt infranchiſement is auaileable for the good of the child, which (by reaſon of his owne act of rebellion) becometh vnprofitable, nay deadly vnto himſelfe. So the character of the true Baptiſme of Chriſt, wherein an hereticall father was dedicated vnto God, may eſtabliſh his ſeed in the ſtate of perfect Chriſtianitie, euen by vertue of that roote, which was the faith of the bleſſed Trinity, and abrenuntiation of all error and wickedneſſe; wherby there doth accrew a greater meaſure of iudgement vnto the father himſelfe, becauſe of his actuall apoſtaſie from ſimplicitie of the holy faith. Notwithſtanding al this our diſcourſe, we wiſh our reader to enquire into the teſtimonies obiected from proteſtants, and trie when they ſaid, that children borne of Chriſtian parents are in the ſtate of grace: whether ſome meant, or elſe ought to haue vnderſtood, according to the iudgemēt of ſome ancients, that ſuch children were Candidati Baptiſmi, that is, had a ius and right vnto Baptiſme; which is common alſo vnto the children of Turkes, but as they are adopted or brought vp by Chriſtians in their families, as it was in the family of Abraham, where ſtrangers bought with money, and their children, by reaſon of the couenant of circumciſion, were called his Seed.

               THE ROMISH APOLOGIE.
               That Proteſtants cannot proue, that the Romane Church did change her Religion, ſince the firſt conuerſion thereto in the Apoſtles time. §. 7.
               
                  And for ſo much as it is your HIGHNESSE In the ſum of the conferēce before the kings Maieſtie, pag. 75 circa med. conſtant and reſolute opinion, that no Church ought further to ſeparate it ſelfe from the Church of Rome, then ſhe hath departed from her ſelfe, when ſhe was in her floriſhing and beſt eſtate. In further prohabilitie therefore of the premiſſes, we do preſume hereby moſt humbly to ſubmit to your MAIESTIHS moſt learned iudgement this briefe diſcourſe had thereof in the two ſections next enſuing. It is generally confeſſed that the Romane Church was once the true Church, and profeſſed the true faith, whereto the

                  Apoſtle himſelfe giueth full and aſſured teſtimonie: whereupon it euidently followeth, that if the Romane Church haue not ſithence changed her religion, then ſhe ſtill retaineth and perſiſteth in the right faith.

                     WE willingly ioyne iſſue, and if we cannot proue that the Romane Church hath in many weightie points of religion degenerated from her ſelfe, then ſhall we no more decline from her as from a malignant ſtep-dame, but deuoutly yeeld vnto her all due acknowledgement, as vnto a mother Church. We muſt deſire our reader then to expect a full euidence and plaine proofe hereof, after that we haue firſt

remoued thoſe rubbes which the Apologiſts haue caſt in our way, by manifold obiections, as firſt queſtioning,

                        Now as touching her ſuppoſed change; we will briefly examine what our learned aduerſaries (who haue purpoſely and ſeriouſly laboured in diſcouery or proofe of this pretēded change) do moſt materially obiect in that behalfe. 1 Firſt then

You ſay in the margent that Victor Anno. 198. did firſt appoint that women might baptiſe, by this you do adde more credit to the cauſe, then you are aware of; for Victor was a godly Biſhop and Martyr, and the Church at that time was in great puritie, as not being long after the Apoſtles.

                  2 This firſt point is indeed very materiall; for the act of Victor being rightly pondered, will proue (that we may ſo ſpeake) fatall and preiudiciall to the now Romiſh claime of Primacie: which diſaduantage this their preoccupation (taken from the ſpeech of the Lord Archbiſhop of Canterburie) can no way preuent; for in the ſame obiected place he further profeſſed, ſaying,

                  3 True it is, that the Aſian Biſhops did obſerue the time of Eaſter according vnto the cuſtome of the Iewes, but yet not according vnto the Iewiſh intention, that is, as neceſſarily bound to that time by the law of Moſes, as the De eo (Blaſto) ſcribens Tertullianus, ſic ait: Blaſtus accedens latenter Iudaiſmum vult introducere: Paſcha enim dicit non aliter cuſtodiendum eſſe, niſi ex lege Moſi, quartâ decimâ Menſis. Tertull. Praeſcript. 53. 
                     hereticke Blaſtus taught; but by vertue (as they thought) of an Nicholaus 1. Epiſc. Rom. epiſt. ad Mich. Graecum Imperatorem: Cum Aſiani, inquit, omnes, inter caeteros Euangeliſta Iohanne authore, quartadecima Lunâ cum Iudaeis putarent Paſcha celebrandum, hoc Victor à collegis ſeparauit. Maſſonius lib. 1. de Epiſc. Rom. Tit. Victor, pag. 15. 
                     Apoſtolicall Tradition from S. Iohn, as here is confeſſed: nor yet did they ſchiſmatically, with Cum igitur Blaſtus eius rei cauſa iam ſchiſma confláſſet, &c. Baronius Cardin. Tom. 2. Anno 198. num. 16. 
                     Blaſtus, condemne all other Churches, which did not celebrate the feaſt of Eaſter at the ſame 14. day of the moneth; but, notwithſtanding this difference of rites concerning the obſeruation of Eaſter, did perſiſt in the vnitie of faithfull fellowſhip and loue with all orthodoxall Chriſtians. But Pope Victor began to thunder againſt Chriſtians, and aduenture to excommunicate thoſe holy Biſhops of Aſia, when he became himſelfe an author of that ſchiſme, and (as our Doctor hath ſaid) paſſed the bounds of his authoritie.
                  
                  4 The argument which they oppoſe hereunto is verie pithleſſe: for 
                        See aboue lib. 2. cap. 22. largely diſcuſſed.
                      
                     among thoſe Aſian Biſhops, (as hath bene confeſſed) the famous Polycrates would not be diſſwaded, but ſaid that he was not diſmaied with the terror of the excōmunication of Pope Victor: and other Biſhops commanded Victor to ſeeke concord and peace: and notwithſtanding his excommunication, kept their ancient cuſtome, according as they had decreed in a Councell. And not this onely, but At illi (Aſiani) omnes cum nonnullis alijs Praeſulibus, non ſolum huic manus minimè praebuerunt, verumetiam pertinaciae redarguerunt. Maſſonius ibid. verbis. ſeqq.
                      
                     the ſame Aſians, and other Biſhops reproued the Pope of obſtinacie. Can any require a better argument of their condemning of the Popes vſurped authoritie, then is their contemning his excommunication as a puffe of pride? or any greater derogation from the tranſcendencie of his iudgement, then to contradict his conſtitution by a contrarie decree in a Councell? This ſheweth that all thoſe Aſians, who in thoſe pureſt times of the Church neglected that excommunication, which is the greateſt thunder-bolt that the Pope can ſend forth, were nothing leſſe then Popiſh.

This is an old ſore, and hath bin often rubbed: we now muſt trie the vertue of the ſalue which they haue plaiſtered vpon it: it is compounded of two obſeruations, firſt they would ſhew that this accuſation is falſe, and ſecondly that it is impertinent; both which in their marginal notes are more largely proſecuted.

                  6 They haue poliſhed their margent with a multitude of obiections, to proue that the Arrians had corrupted the Originals: and their chiefe argument is, becauſe that ſundrie ancient Fathers haue alledged diuerſe Canons of the Councell of Nice, which are not found in the fore-named copies of that Councell. Wherunto we anſwer by a diſtinction, acknowledged and publiſhed by their

                  7 This diſtinction betweene Conſtitutions and Canons thus ſtanding, the obiections, which are here made, are preſently refuted, becauſe the contention betweene the Africanes and the Popes of Rome was concerning Canons, and our Aduerſaries inſtances are about Conſtitutions and Acts, which are to be diſcerned from the Canons properly ſo called, and were but twentie.
                  8 This collection agreeth with the iudgement of their owne Ieſuite Turrian (taken from Balſamon,) where ſpeaking of the time of the celebration of Eaſter, (both which are here obiected by the Apologiſts, as recorded in the true Canons of the Councell of Nice,) he granteth that they are Ad eadem acta referendi ſunt Nicaeni Canones de generibus non ordinandorum, de poenitentibus in Epiſt. 6.

                  SECT. 4.
                  11 For the proofe of this impertinencie, the Apologiſts in their marginall notes, tell vs of two Councels of Sardis, one Hereticall, and another Catholicall: by which latter the foreſaid Canon of Appeales to Rome was decreed. For confirmation whereof they produce Caluine, as one thinking that the Popes did not forge, but onely mistake it, by alledging this decree of Sardis, as a decree of the Councell of Nice. Hence iſſueth their concluſion; So cleare (ſay they) hereby it is, that Zozimus, Boniface, and Celeſtine (three Popes) were no innouators.
                  
                  12 We craue their patience to giue vs leaue in the examination hereof, to conſult not onely with the relaters of (as will appeare) doubtfull and confuſed ſtories, but with the moſt ſubtle diſcuſſers thereof. Now then, vnto whom doth this laſt refuge, concerning the Canon of a Catholike Councell of Sardis, ſeeme to be ſo cleare? Doth M. Caluine ſo eſteeme of it?

                     S. Auguſtine (ſaith Cardinall Bellarmine) did not acknowledge that there was any Councell of Sardis, except that, which is iudged of all men to haue bene hereticall; and the godly Biſhops in the Councell of Africke are confeſſed to haue bene

                     although this Canon was not in the Councell of Nice, but in Sardis, yet the Popes named it the Nicene Canon, becauſe the Councell of Nice and of Sardis were held both as one.

                     and vnder the patronage of the Emperour Conſtantius (ſay our Aduerſaries) proclaimed it ſor the orthodoxall Sardice; by which impoſtureſhip it came to paſſe, that afterwards S. Auguſtine and other Catholicks (ſay they) ignorantly conceiued both the Sardicans to be one, and therefore did deteſt both as impious and hereticall.
                  
                  
                     
17 Theſe anſwers are fettered with foure notable improbabilities: for firſt, to imagine that only Rome did preſerue the true copies of the Nicene Councel, is ſo to dignifie the integritie of one Chaire, as therby to impute an irreligious and vnpardonable negligence vnto all other Churches (as well Greeke as Latine) throughout the Chriſtian world, for neglect of a Canon, which, in their opinion, doth neceſſarily concerne the vniuerſall Church of Chriſt.
                  18 Secondly, to thinke, that becauſe the name of Sardican Councell was made common vnto the orthodoxall and the hereticall parties, there followed a confuſion of the Councels themſelues, is but a negligent conceit: for, as the Spirit of God diſtinguiſheth the community of names by the diuerſity of Adiuncts, as (for example) the name Simon, which was common to the diſciple of Chriſt with a maiſter of Magicke, is diſcerned by additions, thus, Simon Peter, and Simon Magus; by which ſirnames the perſons themſelues are diſtinguiſhed. So alſo the name of Iudas commō vnto an elect Saint with a child of perdition, is notified by diſtinct attributes thus, Iudas Iames brother, and Iudas Iſcariot. So had it bene eaſie for the Catholicks and true profeſſors in the daies of Conſtantius, to haue auoided the ſuppoſed confuſion of the names of Sardice, either by the adiunct of time, in calling the one the first, the other the ſecond; or in reſpect of quantitie, by naming one the greater, & the other the leſſe: or from the difference of qualitie, mentioning the one by the name of orthodoxall and Catholicke, and the other Arrianicall & hereticall: and by any note of diſtinction, although it had bin by calling the one A, and the other B, rather then to haue ſuffered (which they now pretend) that an See aboue in this Chapter. 
                     Oecumenicall Councell of Sardice, and of equall autoritie with the ancient Councell of Nice, to vaniſh for a long time, and ſo, in a manner to betray, by negligence, a doctrine of truth.
                  19 The third improbabilitie reſulteth from the conſideration of S. Auguſtine and the Church of Africke, who notwithſtanding that they liued not long after the time of the imagined Sardican Councell, yet did they not acknowledge any orthodoxal Councell of Sardice, and are for this cauſe by our Aduerſaries termed Ignorants: and yet do all the learned know and acknowledged theſe Africane Churches to haue bene noble members of the Catholike bodie of Chriſt, for ſinceritie as faithfull, for all induſtrie as painefull, for conueniencie more fit and able to diſcuſſe, diſcerne, and diſcouer this truth, then any new coniecturall diſcourſe can be.
                  20 The laſt improbabilitie is that which maruellouſly preiudiceth their Romane See; for in their anſwers their Popes are brought in alſo as deceiued by the Scribe, who in ſteed of Sardice put in the Councell of Nice: and when this is diſproued by the words of the Popes Legate, (who in the foreſaid Councell of Africke made expreſſe mention of the Councel of Sardice) they then anſwer, that In iſto Conc. Carthag. 6. c. 6. citatur nominatim Sardicenſe.—Reſpondeo, illa verba non eſſe Africanorum, ſed Legatorum Pontificis. Et praetereà exiſtimo eum locum corruptum, & vel poſitum à librarijs, aut quod magis ſuſpicor, ex margine irrepſiſſe in textum. Bellar lib. 2. de Pont. cap. 25. §. Sed dices. 
                     theſe words of the Legates may be ſuſpected (by the fault of ſome ſcribes) to haue crept out of the margent into the text. The prouerbe ſaith, Ex vngue leonem, & may not we perceiue how licentiate-like the Romiſh Scribes in thoſe times were for the aduantaging of the Popes prerogatiues? But yet againe, the Popes (ſay they) named it the Councell of Nice, becauſe the Councell of Nice and Sardice were held as both one. How could this be, ſeeing that the

difference of their times is noted by themſelues, to haue bene no leſſe then the ſpace of 18 Nicaenum Conc. anno 325. Sardicenſe, 347. Baronius.

                  25 By this canuaſſe of ſo important a caſe, viz. Appeales vnto Rome, which at this day is made an eſſentiall prerogatiue of the Popedome, we cannot but obſerue, that in thoſe ancient times it was not acknowledged as due vnto the Pope, either by diuine lawe, or by ordinance Eccleſiaſticall: for if it had appertained vnto him by that lawe of Chriſt, would either the then Popes haue conceited, or thoſe Affricane Biſhops denied the right of appealing vnto (as they now pretend) the ſucceſſor of S. Peter, the Vicar of Chriſt, and ſupreme Iudge of the whole Church? And if any vniuerſal conſtitution Eccleſiaſticall had eſtabliſhed it, would ſo reuerend, ancient, & famous a Councell, which was ſo inquiſitiue into the acts of the Councell of Nice, haue conſpired with generall conſent to decree ſo ſolemnly, ſo ſeuerely, and reſolutely againſt it? Doubtleſſe, if thoſe Popes could then haue pleaded Goſpell for it, they would haue mentioned, at leaſt, one text of Scripture for proofe of that priuiledge: and if any generall Councell had acknowledged it, S. Auguſtine and the Africane Biſhops would not haue refuſed it. * Card. Bellarm. his anſwer, ſaying that the queſtion was not an liceret, ſed an expediret, is confuted by the proceeding

               3 Thirdly, M. Whitaker giueth example in Pope Syritius, ſaying,

                     MAiſter Whitaker directly ouer the place obiected, did note the Popes Qui verbi Miniſtris perpetuū coelibatum primus iniecit, is Syricius Pontifex fuit. Loco citato: alledging in the margent Diſt. 82. C. Propoſuiſti.

                     Hugo, ſaying, that the Apoſtles did not ordaine, that they (ſpeaking of Prieſts and Deacons) ſhould not haue the vſe of wedlocke, which they had contracted before their ordination. Where alſo their Romiſh Gloſſe ſaith, that ſome affirme Syricius to haue brought in the law of continencie of Prieſts and Deacons: and whereas the text of the Decree nameth antiquitie for proofe of the law of continencie, that is (ſaith the Gloſſe) from the time of Syricius. Which ſeemed alſo vnto their Polydore a ſufficient proofe, for hereupō 
                     At Occidentalibus paulatim eſt connubium abrogatum: Syricius enim primus Sacerdotibus & Diaconis, vt ait Gratian. Diſt. 82. coniugio interdixit: qui circiter annum ſalutis humanae 387. ſedere coepit. Polydor. Virgil. de Inuent. lib. 5. cap. 4. pag. 319. 
                     Syricius was the firſt (ſaith he) who, as Gratian ſaith, in the yeare 387. did forbid the marriage of Prieſts. Which Gloſſe hath bene allowed by their laſt corrected edition of Pope 
                        Editio Greg. 13. Gregorie the thirteenth. And could it be modeſtie in the Apologiſts contrarily to affirme, that M. Whitaker alledged no proofe? We muſt in the next place ſee how they can free Syricius from the guilt of innouation.

                     Secondly, we alledge moſt plainely to the contrarie, how that S. Hierome who liued in the time of Damaſus predeceſſor to Syritius, ſaith hereof: 
                        Hierom. in apolog ad Pamach c. 3. and the ſame doctrine doth he affirme in c. 1. ad Titum. If married men like not this, let them not be angrie with me but with the holy Scriptures, with all Biſhops, Prieſts, and Deacons, who know they cannot offer Sacrifice, if they vſe the act of marriage. And this opinion was then not firſt begunne, but (to the contrarie) ſo vniuerſall, that Hierome affirmeth it to be the generall Doctrine and practiſe of 
                        Hierom. contra Vigilant. c. 1. ſaith: Quid faciunt Orient is Eccleſiae, quid Egypti & ſedis Apoſtolicae? quae aut virgines clericos accipiunt, aut continentes, aut ſi vxores habuerint, mariti eſſe d

                         the Church of the Eaſt, of Egipt and the See Apoſtolick. And in like manner was the marriage of Prieſts long before theſe times ſo plainly impugned euen in the Greeke Church by 
                        Epiphanius haer. 59. after other plaine words had hereof, ſaith, At dices mihi in quibuſdam locis adhuc liberos gignere Presbyteros, Diaconos, & Hipodiaconos: at hoc non eſt iuxta Canonem, &c. So plainly doth he acknowledge hereby a former Canon.

                  THE PROTESTANTS APPEALE: Shewing a great ouerſight of the Apologiſts in vrging theſe teſtimonies of the Fathers.
                  
                  SECT. 2.
                  2 We haue but two anſwers vnto the Apologiſts, to wit, that they like vnskilfull markmen, haue ſhot both ſhort, and alſo ouer the marke. Short, by ignorance (as we thinke) of a difference which there is betweene the condition de matrimonio contrahendo, & de matrimonio contracto, that is, before contracting of matrimonie, and after the matrimonie is contracted. The inſtitution of perpetuall continencie, which was imputed vnto Syricius, was (as the Romiſh Gloſſe, which is noted by Doctor Whitaker, plainly 
                        See aboue Sect. 1. b. expreſſeth,) that although a Prieſt had bene contracted in matrimonie, yet did Syricius enioyne a ſeparation, by this meanes to preſerue a perpetual continencie in the Clergy. But the inſtances which they obiect out of the Fathers, do not intreate at all of matrimonie contracted. And thus our Apologiſts haue bene occupied onely in beating the ayre; for as yet Syricius may go for an innouator in his abſolute decree of perpetuall continencie, vnto perſons Eccleſiaſticall.
                  3 Their next fault is ouer-ſhooting: which we will ſhew orderly in their ſeuerall teſtimonies. Firſt the former ſentence of S. Hierome is much depraued: for it ſhould haue bene expreſſed thus: If married men like not this, let them not be angrie with me, but with Scriptures, with Biſhops, Prieſts, and Deacons, (then followeth that, which the Apologiſts haue learnedly omitted) yea and with all the order Leuiticall, who knew (the Apologiſts haue changed into know) that they could not offer Sacrifice, when they vſed the marriage-bed. In the which place S. Hierome proueth onely the excellencie of virginitie in reſpect of marriage: 
                     Opera legis nuptiae ſunt, vnde & maledicuntur eae, quae non habent filios. Quae ſi conceduntur etiam in Euangelio, aliud tamen eſt indulgentiam infirmitati tribuere, aliud eſt virtutibus praemia polliceri. Ecce perſpicuè diximus nuptias concedi in Euangelio, ſed tamen coſdem in ſuo officio permanentes praemia caſtitatis capere non poſſe. Quod ſi indignè accipiunt mariti, non mihi iraſcantur, ſed Scripturis ſacris, imò Epiſcopis, Presbyteris, & Diaconis, & vniuerſo cho

                     Behold (ſaith he) we haue plainly confeſſed that the Goſpell doth allow marriage, but ſo, that the married parties do not deſire the reward of virgins; but doth not touch the neceſſitie of perpetual continencie in Prieſts, which the place it ſelfe doth proue by two ſufficient arguments.
                  4 Firſt, let them not be angrie with me, (ſaith he) but with Scriptures, reprouing onely that which is reproueable by Scriptures: but the See aboue. Ieſuites themſelues haue confeſſed, euen from the ſentence of the Councell of Trent, that the marriage of Prieſts' is not forbidden by Scriptures. Secondly, he vſeth the example of the Leuiticall Priests, who although they were commanded to containe, during the courſe of their ſacrificing (which proueth the excellency of virginitie,) yet were they married. Which clauſe, leſt it might appeare, the Apologiſts did artificially diſcard, and as though it had bene directly ſpoken of Biſhops, Prieſts, and Deacons of the new Teſtament, did change the tence of the verbe [knew] into [know.] Againe, elſewhere his conſequences are as ſtrong to proue that the Laitie may not be married, becauſe the Apoſtle ſaith: 
                        Supra in eadem Apologia. Sed qui ſemel duxit vxorem, niſi ex conſenſu ſe non valet abſtinere—reddat coniugi debitum, quia ſponte ſe alligauit, vt regete cogeretur. Pag. 102. Similiter viri cohabitantes iuxta ſcientiam—vt

5 The next teſtimonies of 
                        S. Hieroms 2. Teſtimonie, Aut ſi vxores habuerint mariti eſſe deſinūt, doth not exact it by neceſſitie of law, but by liberty of conſent, a

                     Hierome and of Epiphanius his Canon concerneth not them who are maried, which is Syricius his caſe.
                      
                     Epiphanius, are not within the compaſſe of this queſtion, which onely concerneth Syricius.
                  
                  6 The words of Origen ſeeme at the firſt view to giue the vp-ſhot, but it aimeth alſo at a wrong marke: for he mentioning Orig. hom 23. ſpeaking of euery Chriſtian: Agnoſcat quiſquis vult eſſe perſectus & ſanctus—quod ſemper & indeſinenter iuſtus debet facere diem feſtum.—Sacrificium indeſinens eſt ſi ſine intermiſſione oremus—certum eſt qui peccat, & diem peccati agit, agere non poteſt diem feſtum: & ideo in diebus, quibus pecat, non poteſt offerre indeſinens ſacrificium. Then followeth: Nolite fraudare vox inuicem niſi ex conſenſu ad tempus, vt vacetis orationi, & iterum in idipſum ſitis (then the place obiected) certum eſt quia impeditur indeſinens ſacrificium ijs, qui &c. 
                     perpetuall ſacrifice of praier, doth directly apply his ſpeech vnto euerie one that can pray vnto God, and doth as well proue that no Chriſtian man may be married, as it doth euince the vnlawfulneſſe of marriage in Prieſts.
                  7 Yet leſt that our anſwers may ſeeme to our Aduerſaries leſſe perſwaſible, we referre them vnto their owne Biſhop Eſpencaeus, who expoundeth the ſentence of 
                        Vnto the place of Origen which was obiected: Vides de perpetuo omnium feſto, non de proprio Sacerdotum ſacrificio ſermonem eſſe; although be addeth, quem tamen ſtatim poſt, ſed cunctanter & timidè—ad continentiam a
                           •
                        raxit, but not onely of Prieſts. And a little before: Is (Origenes) nunquam non audiuit vt nimis tum caſtus, tum allegoricus, &c.

                     when in the Councell of Nice it had bene intended to forbid thoſe Biſhops, Prieſts, and Deacons the vſe of their wiues, who had married before their ordination (which Socrates calleth a bringing in of a new law) then aroſe vp Paphnutius, who himſelfe had neuer bene married, and vehemently reſiſted them, calling this kind of Conſtitution an heauie yoake, and reaſoned from that Scripture, 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , &c. [Marriage is honourable among all men:] that they, who were vnmarried before their ordination. ſhould ſo continue according vnto the old tradition: and in the end, the whole Synode conſented vnto the iudgement of Paphnutius. This is the ſtorie.
                  9 We are now to enquire whether the Romaniſts or Proteſtants haue more cauſe to allow or diſlike the decree of this Councell; for each ſide is both croſſed, and aduantaged hereby. The Councell alloweth men married before they were ordained, to continue in the ſame ſtate of wedlocke: this part of the decree the Proteſtants do apprehend. The ſame Councell reſtraineth them from marriage, who were vnmarried when they entred into Orders: which part the Romaniſts do no leſſe vehemently vrge and inculcate. The ods herein will be very obſeruable.
                  10 Vnderſtand we therefore that the abſolute forbidding of the marriage of Prieſts, is called in that Councell a new law, and the reſtraint of their marriage after ordination, is termed an old tradition: and may not now both parts ſeeme to be euen? No: for the new law, which Syricius did defend contrarie vnto the wiſedome of that Councell, Paphnutius did there proue to be repugnant vnto Scripture: but that which was called an old tradition, and

whereunto Proteſtants do take exception, is not (our Aduerſaries witneſſing thus much) commanded in Scripture, but ordained onely by Eccleſiaſticall conſtitutions: ſo that Syricius and his defenders ſtand guiltie of the breach of diuine law, but Proteſtants onely do tranſgreſſe the ordinance of man.
                  11 Secondly (to compare Tradition with Tradition▪) the licence of marriage of Prieſts is as ancient as the Audi quid Clemens ad

                        So euident hereby it is, that Siritius in his foreſaid doctrine hereof, brought in no innouation or change.

                  17 Nay rather, ſo euident it is that Syricius was the Innouator, that nothing hath bene yet obiected to the contrarie, but an vnlearned miſtaking of the ſtate of the controuerſie, by not diſcerning betweene marriage before, and marriage after ordination; or betweene a partly, and an abſolutely forbidding of the marriage of Ministers: the firſt whereof, ſome more ancient then Syricius had taught, but the ſecond Syricius did firſt decree, as hath bene

                        Sect. 2. marriage-bed, from the expreſſe euidence of antiquity.
                  19 Thirdly, they haue inſiſted vpon the decree of the Councell of Nice, by the direction of Paphnutius, to the vtter ouerthrow of their preſent cauſe, as hath bene proued by the euidence of many

                  20 Laſtly, they haue laboured to proue a decree againſt marriage of Prieſts before Syricius by the Canon of a Councel of Carthage, which Councell was either at the ſame time when Syricius liued, or rather many yeares after; and not ſo onely, but alſo miſ-conſt

                     at the Councell of Laterane (ſaith Platina) many things were conſulted vpon, but nothing plainly defined, by reaſon of ſome warres in ſome places; whither Pope Innocentius went, with purpoſe to compoſe thoſe contentions, and died at Peruſium, as others do likewiſe confeſſe.

                  10 As yet then nothing appeareth to proue the Councell of Laterane, but Pope Innocentius onely to haue bene the author of thoſe Canons, and conſequently in this point an innouator: therefore cannot theſe Apologiſts be iudged fit men to pleade the euidēce of truth, who ſtand onely vpon an improbable, if not an impoſſible improbabilitie, for their diſcharge. And yet they continue their plea.

                        The truth hereof therefore was moſt plainely to the contrarie, that in the age before that Councell, the doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation was publike and generall: onely Berengarius as then impugned the ſame, and was therein publikely contradicted, and ſpecially written againſt by diuerſe Fathers 
                        There did in that age write purpoſely in proofe of the Reall preſence Anſelmus, Lanfrancus, Guitmundus, Adelmanus, Algerus, Hugo Lingonenſis, and others: inſomuch that Papir.

About the yeare of our Lord 1060. the denying of Tranſubſtantiation, began to be accounted hereſie, and in that number was firſt one Berengarius who liued about Anno. 1060. So farre was Tranſubſtantiation from being (as M. Whitaker pretendeth) firſt affirmed or inuented afterwards in the Councell of Laterane Anno. 1215.

                     D. Whitaker in the place obiected. 
                     Whitaker confeſſeth to haue bene held by Pope Nicholas (who liued before this Innocentius, in the yeare 1060, as the Apologiſts themſelues acknowledge,) but the controuerſie is concerning the manner of his * See hereafter their 8. inſtance.
                      preſence, whether it were by changing the ſubſtance of the bread into the ſubſtance of the bodie of Chriſt, which our Aduerſaries call Tranſubſtantiation, holding it for an article of faith; and this article our Doctor hath aſcribed vnto Pope Innocentius the third, as vnto the prime and principal patron thereof: and therefore is he here noted as one gainſaying an euident truth: yet hath he ſaid no more then their owne great Schoole-men haue affirmed, ſaying of Tranſubſtantiation, that Vnum addit Scotus, quod minimè probandum eſt, ante Lateranenſe Concilium non fuiſſe dogma fidei Tranſubſtantiationem: id enim ille dixit, quia non legerat Conc. Romanum ſub Gregorio 7. neque conſenſum illum Patrum quem nos ſuprà adduximus. Bellar. l. 3. de Euch. c. 23. §. Vnum. But ſee this confuted in this Section▪ and of Gabriel ſee herafter cap. 21. Sect. 2. 
                     before the Councell of Laterane it was no doctrine of Faith.
                  
                  12 Secondly, we ought to diſcerne among the Romaniſts a double Tenet concerning Tranſubſtantiation, the one is onely in the probabilitie of opinion, the other in beliefe of neceſsitie thereof, as it is now held in the Church of Rome. Doctor Whitaker doth not affirme that Innocentius was the firſt inuenter of the opinion, but the firſt author to authorize it for a doctrine of faith. Theſe two diſtinctions premiſed, we put the matter vnto triall.

Bellarmine examining the time of Berengarius (vnder Pope Nicholas the ſecond) ſheweth, that he was not then condēned for Tranſubſtantiation about that time, but in a Romane Councell vnder Gregory the ſeuenth: which was ſome ninteene yeares after. But how is this proued? Becauſe, forſooth, Waldenſis (one of their owne Schoole-men) hath made mention of this Synode. How ſhall we beleeue this, ſeeing they are 
                        See Surius in his third Tome of the Councel ſub Greg. 7. not able to ſhew vs any ſuch acts of any Councell vnder Gregory the ſeuenth? For except

they will condemne their Church of impietie in neglecting the preſeruation of the Popes actes, which they hold (eſpecially in a matter of this moment) as an Oracle of God, they can deſerue no credite in this pretence.
                  14 The concluſion from our firſt diſtinction is, that ſeeing Berengarius is not found to haue bene condemned for the article of Tranſubſtantiation either about the yeare 1060, or (for ought that hath bene proued) vnder Gregory the ſeuenth, their inſtance taken from Berengarius can make but a

                  15 We come to examine the neceſſitie thereof, and what decree of credit they ſtampe vpon it, whether of common opinion, or (as our Doctor meant) of a general & neceſſarie doctrine of faith.

                     It is true (ſaith he) that Tranſubstantiation was not before the Councell of Laterane formally any article of faith, which is by publike prohibition to make euery one that is ignorant hereof, inexcuſable. Why then did their Cardinall Bellarmine pretend a former

Thus are our Aduerſaries catcht in their owne ſnares; for if the aſſertion of their Doctor Scotus be reprehenſible, how can their Biſhop of Eureux defend him? and if he may be defended, why hath the ſame aſſertion of our Doctor Whitaker bene reprehended?

                  2 Seeing they haue failed in the materiall ſence, can they thinke to preuaile in terminis? No: for the title of Head may ſignifie either a primacie and chiefdome of order and ſuperioritie, or elſe of ſoueraignty and iuriſdiction. Ancient See aboue in the queſtions concerning the Pope and Rome. Fathers, we confeſſe, haue yeelded vnto Rome the primacie of order aboue other Churches, but that of iuriſdiction they did anciently not onely not acknowledge, but alſo withſtand. Whoſe teſtimonies, which concerne onely the former, are here incongruouſly produced for proofe of the latter, excepting the teſtimonies which are taken from the Popes themſelues, whom the Centuriſts do reprehend and reiect as therefore partiall witneſſes in their owne cauſe.
                  3 The only expreſſe teſtimonie, which they would charge their text with, is this: Romana Eccleſia eſt omnium Eccleſiarū caput, that is, the Church of Rome is the head of all Churches. This they alledge in terminis from the authoritie of the ancient & general Councell of Calcedon, which is very true, but in terminis
                     
onely, and not in ſence. For thereby was not vnderſtood the headſhip of iuriſdiction ouer other Churches, as euidently appeareth by the practiſe of the Romane Biſhops, who repealed ſome actes of that Councell of Calcedon, euen becauſe it derogated from the 
                        See confeſſed aboue, lib. 2. c. 18. Sect. 2. 
                     preheminence of the Romane See.
                  4 Hitherto haue we inſiſted in the matter and in termes ſeuerally, now both of them are ioyntly to be conſidered from the ſame example of Boniface. Their owne Authors Maſſonius, Blondus, and Polydore do affirme, that Obtinuit tamen à Phoca, vt Rom. ſedes omninò & abſolutè prima diceretur Idue Pauli Diaconi ſyncero teſtimonio firmare licet, qui illa ferè tempora attigit.

                            Anno Chriſti 606. num. 1, 2, 3, 4. 
                     Pope Boniface in the daies of Gregory, had by his merits inſinuated into the fauour of Phocas, at what time Cyriacus Patriarch of Conſtantinople became hatefull vnto him, vpon which hatred Phocas profeſſed, that the Biſhop of Rome ſhould be accounted the head of all Churches: which Phocas ſo ordained, as it may ſeeme, in hatred of the Patriarch Cyriacus. Now the cauſe of his hate was this, when Conſtantina the wife of Mauritius the Emperor, fled for refuge vnto a great Church with her three ſonnes, the tyrant Phocas ſent men to apprehend them, but by the meanes of Cyriacus the diſtreſſed ones were deliuered: wherefore the tyrant grieued for the loſſe of ſo great a prey, whereby he ſaw an occaſion miniſtred of creating a new Emperour, therefore was he enraged againſt Cyriacus, and did whatſoeuer he could againſt him.
                  
                  6 The obſeruable points of this confeſſion our Reader will eaſily diſcerne, viz. Phocas a traiterous vſurper, a bloudie tyrant, is the Emperour, into whoſe friendſhip Pope Boniface inſinuateth himſelfe: who is now become a petitioner for the vniuerſall primacie, and his aduerſarie Cyriacus Patriarch of Conſtantinople, growne into hatred and diſgrace, becauſe he abhorred the tyrannie of the ſame Phocas: who therefore contrarie to the cuſtome of his predeceſſors, eſtabliſhed Boniface in his new chaire of vniuerſalitie: in which terme of head, Boniface apprehended more then peraduenture was granted vnto him, viz. a preheminence not of degree onely, but alſo of dominiō ouer al Chriſtian Churches. Which we ſee firſt iſſued from the perſon of a wretched tyrant,
                     
in hatred of a Patriarch abhorring his tyrannie; and was forthwith conferred vpon a Pope both louing him, and fauoured of him, and that (which argueth the noueltie of the grant) contrarie to the cuſtome of his predeceſſors. By which we ſee, that our Doctor hath bene indeed partly refelled in the termes, but in termes onely, yet fully iuſtified in the truth of his aſſertion, notwithſtanding their other

                            are not of force: for the epiſtles attributed vnto the Popes of old times, are weakened much by the ſuſpition of our Aduerſaries themſelues.

                   It is not to be doubted but that the dead are holpen by the praiers of the holy Church, and the healthfull ſacrifice, and almes which are imployed for their ſoules, that God will deale with them more mercifully then their ſinnes deſerued, for this doth the vniuerſall Church obſerue as deliuered from our forefathers: and elſewhere he ſaith no leſſe certainly:

                   It may not be denied but that the ſouls of the deceaſſed are relieued by the pietie of their liuing friends, when for them is offered the ſacrifice of the mediator &c. In ſo much as he for the Latine Church doubted not to

                     all did not agree about the ſtate of mans ſoule, which might haue benefit by the praiers of the liuing. Which diuerſity we will methodically handle.
                  2 They conſidered the caſe of mens ſoules departed, either

in the ſtate of damnation, or elſe in the ſtate of ſaluation: and this latter in a double reſpect, firſt as it is a miſerie ſubiect vnto a temporall griefe, which ſome Fathers thought to be eaſed and relieued by praiers: or ſecondly as it enioyeth reſt; and this reſt hath bene conceiued by ſome Fathers to be in loco refrigerij, in the place of eaſe and refreſhing, which they call a common receptacle of the ſoules of the elect without the court of heauen, there to continue vntill the general reſurrection. By others it is beleeued to be the high pallace of heauen, and fruition of the preſence of God, and the Lambe Chriſt Ieſus. In all theſe different conſiderations we reade in ſome Fathers diuerſe maners of praying for their ſoules, and are therefore now to enquire punctually what is amongſt theſe the true Apoſtolicke and Catholicke doctrine.

                     little caſe of the ſoules of the damned, the Romaniſts iointly with Proteſtants, do freely and iuſtly reiect. The ſecond forme of praiers ariſeth onely from the opinion, that ſome ſoules are in a paradice, without the quire of heauen: which opinion of their eſtate becauſe our Aduerſaries likewiſe See aboue. cōdemne, therfore ought they not to approue the praiers, which iſſued from them in that onely reſpect.
                  4 Two formes of praiers onely remaine, wherein we are further to inſiſt. The firſt is that which is applied vnto ſoules that are conceiued to be tormented in the boiling fire of Purgatorie. This is that which our Aduerſaries do contend for.
                  5 The other, which, according vnto ancient Liturgies, hath bene vſed for the Saints in bleſſedneſſe, in this forme:

                     Vouchſafe to remember thoſe, who from generations haue pleaſed thee in this life, ſuch as were the holy Fathers, Patriarchs, Prophets, Apostles, and the bleſſed virgine Mary, together with all the Saints.

                     the time of refreſhing ſhall come from the preſence of the Lord. If then we ſhall tie our ſelues vnto the ſcope of the queſtion, as Vliſſes vnto his maſt, we ſhall not ſo eaſily be ſeduced with the termes of vniuerſall faith. Now we enter vpon
               
               
                  
                     A particular examination of the doctrine of Aërius, and the reprehenſion of Epiphanius.
                  SECT. 2.
                  6 Concerning Aërius it hath bene anſwered, that we are to put a difference betweene the publike actions of the Church, and the priuate interpretations c B. Bilſon in his gouerment of the Church, cap. 13.
                     
of the two fore-named Fathers: the publike actions were the commemoration and thankſgiuing in the teſtimonie of our hope, euen for Martyrs: and although Epiphanius and ſome others did doubtfully think that the ſame mens damnation might be mitigated by praier, howſoeuer their ſtate could not be altered; yet theſe ſpeculations were not compriſed in the publike praiers of the Church, nor confirmed by them, and for that cauſe was he iuſtly impugned for condemning the vniuerſall and religious actions of the Catholike Church.
                  
                  7 Againe, Aërius was offended with the vulgar opinion of thoſe times, which thought, that Si vero ommnò preces corum, qui hic ſunt, proſunt illis qui iſthic ſunt igitur nemo fit pius, qui boni quicquam faciat, ſed acquirat amicos quoſdam per quem vult modum, aut per pecumas perſuadens, aut amicis id in obitu demandans, & orent pro ipſo, vt ne quid illic patiatur, neque immedicabilia peccata ab ipſo perpetrata requirantur. Epiphan. haereſ. 75 ante medium.
                      
                     although a man liued neuer ſo wickedly, yet if he could procure ſome men either by money, or by friendſhip, or howſoeuer, to pray for him after his death, he might be freed from puniſhment due vnto him for his ſinnes after his death. And this opinion he falſly & calumniouſly imputed vnto the Church, and thereupon queſtioned, Whether the praiers of the liuing do 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      that is, altogether profite the dead. Vnto this queſtion Epiphanius returneth an anſwer, ſignifying that by mentioning the names of the dead this profit is gained, viz. Poſteà verò quae proferantur nomina vita defunctorum, quid hoc magis fuerit vtile? quid hoc commodius, & magi, admiratione dignum? quod credunt praeſentes quod hi qui praeceſſerunt, viuunt, & non ſunt nulh, ſed ſunt & vmunt apud Dominum: & vt pientiſſ. praedicationem recenſeam, quod ſpes eſt orantibu

                            noteth: Epiphanius docet orationes quae fiunt pro delunctis, prodeſſe, ſed non dicit prodeſſe defunctis—quia per eas id quod eſt perfectius ſignificatur, &c. 
                     Thereby we beleeue that the ſoules departed liue with the Lord. The ſecond profit, is in reſpect of thoſe ſoules of the vniuſt, by intreating pardon for them: but how? 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , altogether? (for that was the queſtion,) no: Epiphanius ſaith, they proſite, 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , that is, although they do not cut off the whole ſin. This, we ſee, is but halfe an anſwer, leauing the other in ſuſpence, and yet this is all that Epiphanius anſwereth.
                  8 If this Father had beleeued Purgatory, here the queſtion of Aërius challenged him to haue expreſſed himſelfe, in yeelding a full anſwer according vnto the now Romiſh

                  10 But much more are we moued hereunto by his practiſe, when we find him praying for remiſſion for his mothers ſoule, that God would not enter into iudgement with her, euen then when he confeſſeth, ſaying: Nunc pro peccatis matris meae deprecortc, exaudi me per medicinam vulnerum tuorum quae pependit in cruce, & ſedens ad dextram tuam, te interpellat pro nobis, Dimittc, Domine, dimitte, obſecro, ne intres cum ea in iudicium.

                  12 Iuſtly might M. Gifford affirme, that praying and offering oblations for the dead, was generall in the Church long before the daies of S. Auguſtine. What ergo? Ergo they beleeued a Purgatorie torment of ſoules departed: for this is the confuſed mixture of the Apologiſts, as though there were no other vſe of praiers and oblations for the dead, but onely thereby to mitigate or to quench the flame of Purgatory: but this is an vnlearned collection, and diſſonant from the practiſe of the Greeke Church, which (as their Durantus confeſſeth from Epiphanius, Cyrill, and the Greeke Canon)

And before: Symeon laetus itaque de morte iam proxima, de vicina accerſione ſecurus, accepit in manibus puerum, & benedicens Deum, exclamauit; Nunc dimittis ſeruum tuum, Domine, ſecundùm verbum tuum in pace, quoniam viderunt oculi mei ſalutare tuum: Probans ſcilicet & conteſtans tunc eſſe ſeruis Dei pacem, tunc liberam & tranquillam quietem, quando de iſtis mundi turbinibus extracti, ſedis & ſecuritatis aeternae portum petimus, quando expuncta hac morte ad immortalitatem venimus.—Si me dilexiſſetis gauderctis quoniam ad Patrem vado (Ioh. 14.) docens & oſtendens, cùm chari, quos diligimus, de ſeculo exeunt, gaudendum potius quàm dolendum.

Cyprtanus Serm. 4. de Immortal.
                      in commemoration of them (as he alſo ſheweth in his owne teſtimonie,) and not for purgation of ſinne: for his concluſion is, that the iuſt are called to refreſhing, but the wicked to puniſhment: fancying no third ſtate, but giueth generall inſtruction vnto euerie Chriſtian, to beleeue with Simeon, that they are to depart in peace. But how? in the peace of conſcience only to thinke that after the torment of Purgatorie ſuſtained, they ſhall enioy eternall felicitie? No, but the peace of S. Paul: To die it is an aduantage, becauſe they are deliuered out of temptations of ſinnes, and vexations of this life, and out of the ſnare of the Diuell, paſsing vnto eternall felicitie. But Bomiſh Purgatorie hath (in the opinion of our Aduerſaries) onely a bonum tormenti ſo great as exceedeth all the torments of this world. He therfore that ſaid, that the error of Purgatory was but rifely budded in the daies of S. Auguſtine, who liued in the fourth hundred yeare after Chriſt, doth grant that (in reſpect of true antiquitie) it was but a new plant.
                  
                  15 Now then, ſeeing the queſtion is not who firſt conceited of Purgatorie, for then a man may fetch it from Plato among the Philoſophers, from Virgil among the Poets, and from Origen (for deliuerance of ſoules of the damned) among the Fathers, and for ſoules in reſt from other Fathers: but that which is taught by the Romaniſts is a fierie Purgatorie torment of ſoules, whoſe guilt of mortall ſinnes hath bene pardoned. This doctrine (as 
                        See aboue l. 1. c. 2. §. 14. hath bene conf

Gregory kindled the fire with a credo, from a preſumption taken from ghoſtly apparitions, condemned by antiquitie: and now of late the Romaniſts haue blowne the flame with an Anathema (vpon the contradictor) making it a neceſſarie article of faith.
                  16 To all which we anſwer, embracing S. Auguſtines generall reſolution in like caſes: Legat hoc nobis ex Lege, ex Euangelio, ex literis Apoſtolicis, & credemus. For we find not in Canonicall Scripture, either any expreſſe precept to pray for ſoules departed, or example of any that hath praied for them;

or yet any promiſe of bleſſing vpon any praiers made in that behalfe: and therefore are we perſwaded that many of our Aduerſaries do no leſſe doubtfully beleeue this article of Purgatorie, then they can tell what ſoules are in Purgatory, and how long they continue in that place of torment: which they confeſſe to haue bene Fuit opinio Dominici à Soto in 4. ſent. diſt. 19. q. 3 art. 2.

               7 Seuenthly, M. Whitaker giueth example in Innocentius the third, affirming, that 
                  Whitaker contra Duraeum lib. 7. page 480. poſt medium. He was the firſt that inſtituted auricular confeſſiō for neceſſary: wherto we anſwer that an innouation ſo ſtrange & compulſorie, as for men (againſt all naturall ſhamefaſtneſſe) to be conſtrained to confeſſe their ſecret ſinnes, could neuer haue bene brought in by mans only authority, without ſome open and great contradiction: If therefore Innocentius firſt brought in this vſage before that time ſtrange and vntaught, what Father or other writer of that age then reſiſted it? or who is witreſſe to the change? Herein M. VVbitaker is ſilent.

                     AGainſt the aſſertion of our Doctor they contend by three arguments: the firſt is from naturall ſhamefaſtneſſe, the ſecond from light of the hiſtorie, and the third from the authority of ancient Fathers.
                  2 At the firſt we are conſtrained to maruell why this confeſsion of ſecret ſinnes ſhould ſeeme to be ſo ſingularly ſtrange and compulſarie vnto any that hath true ſence of his owne ſinne, as though that were altogether repugnant vnto a naturall man, which is found to be in practiſe among the infidels themſelues: for Illud meritò mi ari quiſqua poſſit, confeſſionem peccatorum etiam occu

                     among the Indian Paganes (ſaith the Ieſuite Acoſta, not without wondring) auricular confeſsion was in vſe, wherein the heathen laid open to their Prieſts their ſecret and heinous crimes; and not this only, but did alſo inflict puniſhment vpon themſelues for the expiation of their ſinnes, ſuffering themſelues to be whipped of yong men with rods. And if the vglineſſe of the fault required ſo much, to betake themſelues into deſert places, where, after the manner of beaſts, they ſpent their whole life within the holes of rockes.
                  
                  3 Neither yet is this to be wondred at: for it is naturall vnto a man oppreſſed with ſinne, to be apprehenſiue of any thing that ſhall be thought to aſſwage

the griefe of conſcience. For we maruell not why 1. King. 18. 28. 
                     Baals prieſts did lance their own fleſh in praier with kniues, or why other Idolaters, againſt nature, did offer vp their children to be ſacrificed vnto 
                        Leuit. 20. 2. 
                     Moloch, giuing vp the fruits of their bodies for the ſins of their ſouls. For if the diſeaſes of the body compell ſome to put off common ſhamefaſtneſſe, & to yeeld their leſſe honorable parts vnto the view of the Phyſitian: how much leſſe ſhall the afflicted ſoule ſtraine courteſie with naturall ſhamfaſtneſſe, as ſoone as the afflicted conſcience ſhall but conceiue any hope of eaſe. It is the propertie of a ſore and ſorow to call any thing neceſſarie, wherein there is any meanes of comfort and health.
                  4 But then will this confeſſion become more naturall, when as the confeſſor ſhall looke onely vnto the opus operatum, and be perſwaded, that, as it was ſaid vnto Naaman the Leper, 2. Kings 5. 10. 
                     Waſh and be cleane, ſo it is no more but cōfeſſe and be ſafe. Which peraduenture was the conceit of thoſe conuerts of India, who preſumed ſo much of the power of abſolution by the act of conſeſſion, that therby they tooke vnto themſelues a licence of wallowing in ſinne. Which occaſioned a Diuine among them to wiſh that the 
                        See aboue lib. 2. cap. 14. Sect. 7. 
                     auricular confeſſion were vtterly aboliſhed. So that, whether we reſpect the penitencie, or elſe the preſumptuouſneſſe of a ſinner, we ſee no cauſe why the naturall man ſhould ſo vtterly abhorre this kind of confeſſiō. We returne vnto Innocentius.

                  5 Neceſſarily muſt we diſtinguiſh of neceſſity, which is either in part, or elſe abſolute, as it is in Phyſick, that which may recouer my health is partly neceſſarie, but that is abſolutely neceſſarie, without which I cannot be healed. The former, Proteſtants haue in ſome caſes acknowledged to be requiſite: and for the ſecond, which teacheth, that without the act or purpoſe of this manner of confeſſion a man cannot be be ſaued: they haue charged Pope Innocentius the

third of nouelty, & that truly, as may appeare by his own decree, which is this: Atque Innocentius tertius conſtituit, vt qui iam doli capaces eſſe coepiſſent, ſi non ſaepius, at ſemel quotannis confiterentur peccata illis Sacerdotibus, qui eorum ammatum curam haberent. Polyd. Virgil. Inuent. re

                  6 Now let vs ſee how the Apologiſts haue freed Innocentius from the note of innouation. Can the inſtance of the Iacobits ſatisfie herein? No: for (if there had bene any ſuch opinion in them) Cardinall Bellarmine would haue thought it worthie the noting, eſpecially where he doth brand Proteſtants with ancient hereſies.
                  7 As for the other teſtimonies from Authours, who liued about the ſame Centurie, they are not ſufficient to proue the generality of doctrine; becauſe it cannot be denied that not long before the daies of Innocentius this matter was diſputable, as appeareth by their Gratian, (he liuing about the yeare 1198, which is about 50 yeares before the forenamed Innocentius,) who relating the contrarie opinion, leaueth the caſe as indifferent: Quibus authoritatibus vel rationibus vtraque ſententia confeſſionis & ſatifactionis innitatur, in medium breuit

                  11 Neuertheleſſe the obiected place of Baſil (whereby Caniſius laboured

to euince, that the parties who confeſſed vnto the Apoſtles in the Actes, were baptized before they had confeſſed, & cōſequently that this was a ſacramentall confeſsion) was ſo far off from Baſils intention, that their ſaid learned Ieſuite Lorinus feared not otherwiſe to informe vs: I am deceiued (ſaith he) if that baſil do not teach the contrary, which he ſheweth to be the more probable, by the connexion which Baſil maketh with the Iewiſh confeſſion vnto Iohn Baptiſt (which was not ſacramentall,) adding that no ancient Diuines did proue the ſacramentall confeſsion out of that Scripture of the Acts: yea and diuerſe haue denied that it can be proued thereby, or (as one further teacheth) out of the teſtimonie of S. Baſil, who defendeth onely a neceſsitie of repentance, and not of confeſsion. We find nothing in this their diſpute but their vſuall euen and odd, yea and nay, and all about that which cannot be found.

Seeing thē the doctrine hereof is a noueltie of after-times, whether D.

Secondly, concerning the

                  2 The forme of recantation, preſcribed vnto Berengarius, was in theſe words: Ego Berengarius &c.—Conſentio autem ſanctae Rom. Eccleſiae, & Apoſtolicae ſedi, & orc & corde conſiteor de Sacramentis Dominicae men ſae endem ſidem me tencre, quam Dominus & venerabilis Papa Nicolaus, & haec ſancta Synodus authoritate Euangelica & Apoſtolica tenendam tradidit, mihiue firmauit, ſcilicet panem & vinum, quae in altari ponuntur, poſt conſecrationem non ſolùm Sacramentum, ſed etiam verum corpus & ſanguinem Domini noſtri Ieſu Chriſti eſſe; & ſenſualiter non ſolum Sacramentum, ſed in veritate manibus Sacerdotum tractari, frangi, & ſidelium dentibus atteri. Surius Conc. Tom. 3. pag. 600. 
                     I Berengarius do profeſſe, that I hold the ſame faith which the venerable Pope Nicholas and his holy Synode doth preſcribe to be beleeued, to wit, that the bread and wine which are ſet on the altar, are after conſecration not onely a Sacrament, but alſo the very bodie and bloud of Chriſt, and are ſenſibly handled and broken by the hands of the Prieſts, & torne with the teeth of the faithfull communicants.

                     obſerue diligently whē the Fathers ſpeake things in the way of contention, and when they deliuer a doctrine definitiue with a determination; in the former manner of their ſpeech, the Reader (ſay they) oweth no beliefe vnto them, but in the ſecond. And there is no ſuch nouice which hath peruſed the Fathers writings, but knoweth that in their ſermons vnto the people, they take a liberty in their ſpeeches by exceſſe and by alluſions, to make their exhortations & perſwaſions more emphatical, which in their determinations of matters of faith they did religiouſly auoid; euē as it is in the common acts of men, who when they write a letter of commendations, can ſpeake freely; but in an Indenture or Obligation, it behooueth them to be more caurelous for feare of a writ of errour. So here, if Pope Nicholas had bene exerciſed in a Sermon, ſuch phraſes might paſſe for figuratiue; but now that an expreſſe forme of reconciliation, & a determination of an article of their Church was to be inioyned as a definitiue direction for all others, in this point of faith the Popes ſentence cannot admit this Apologie, but ſtandeth ſtill guiltie of an innouation.

                  THE PROTESTANTS APPEALE: Concerning the ſtate of this queſtion.
                  
                  SECT. 1.
                  
                     WE are now brought vnto the challenge of all challenges in this queſtion of antiquity, which is, to notifie the change of the Romiſh Religion. The demonſtratiō hereof may be of two ſorts, either 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , or 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     : that is, either negatiuely, to ſhew whē any doctrine was not, or poſitiuely, to point out the verie time when the change firſt began. Our aduerſaries are not contented with the firſt, but exact of Proteſtants a poſitiue demonſtratiō, which Cardinal Bellarmine deſcribeth by ſeuerall adiuncts, ſaying: in omni inſigni mutatione Religionis, ſemper iſta ſex demonſtrari poſſunt, 1. author, 2. dogma aliquod nonum, 3. tempus, 4. locus, 5. quis, 6. eriguus caetus vnde coeperit; nam illa omnia inuenimus in ipſa Chriſti Eccleſia, quae tamē non fuit noua Eccleſia, ſed ſolùm mutatio quaedam ſtatus Eccleſiae ſecundum Prophetarum praedictiones.—Quod verò nihil horum de nobis oſtendere poſſint, perſpicuum eſt. Bellar. l. 4. de Eccleſ. milit. c. 5. §. In omni. 
                     In euerie notable change of Religion, ſix points were alwaies obſerueable. viz. the Author who, the doctrine what, the time when, place where, perſon by whom the riſiſting was made, and the ſmall number of profeſſors thereof at the firſt, euen as they are diſcernable in the beginning (as he ſaith) of Chriſtian Religion: and then he aſſumeth, that no one of all theſe
                     
                     circumſtances of innouation can be ſhewed in the Church of Rome. Which argument is held of other Quid abſurdius quàm Romanam Eccleſiam innumeris penè haereſibus refertam vociferari, quarum ne vna quo Pontifice, quâ viâ qua vi, quibus incrementis vrbem & orbem inuaſerit, queas demonſtrate.

                        gree of the increaſe and proceedings thereof. Which argument they further ſeeke to fortifie by our Authors confeſſion, but altogether Rem ſine verbo Dei, ſine vllo exemplo, praeſumptionibus & coniecturis incertiſſimis adfirmari—viz Viciſſitudinariam praeſidentiam fuiſſe mutatam—per vniuerſum orbem, & iuſtis de cauſis: ſed à quibus & quando hoc fieri coeptum eſt, fateri pudet, ne praeuaricari videatur. Sarauia, loco citato. The point is the annual change of the Elders, which being no doctrinall point, but a rituall and circumſtantiall, the matter is impertinent vnto our purpoſe. So likewiſe the teſtimonie borrowed frō Archbiſhop Whitgiſt concerneth matters of the like nature, and are of as litle moment, as hath bene proued at large aboue, lib. 2. Neuertheleſſe it is good reaſon that whoſoeuer ſhall note any thing for an innouation, and attri

                      impertinently. We contrarily oppoſe two things, the fiſt is 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , to wit;
               
               
                  
                     That it is not neceſſarie, for the confutation of errours, to demonstrate the time, or other ſuch circumſtances of the beginning of them, as may be illuſtrated by ſimilitudes.
                  
                  SECT. 2.
                  2 The ſimilitude taken from the haire of mans head, which by little and litle waxeth white, is by the Apologiſts much diſtaſted, albeit etiam capillus habet ſuam vmbram; that is, his ſimile did ſhadow forth 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , that is the matter principally intended: for the haire, of blacke waxeth white, and yet is not diſcernable in the moments of change. But no ſimile will content them, except it may gallop on foure feete: when as indeed Logicke (although it be the art of arts) cannot giue any ſimilitude, which ſhall not halt of one leg.
                  3 That which doth moſt nearely ſample this point, may be firſt the 
                        Matth. 13. 24. 
                     tares, which are ſaid to haue bene ſowen whileſt the houſholders were aſleepe, and did not appeare vntill they were ſprong vp in the blade. For if likewiſe Chriſtians be asked concerning the firſt ſeeding of ſome errors, they may anſwer, that they know not preciſely the time; onely this they know, that the husbandmen not regarding the ſeed (becauſe it ſeemed litle & of no danger) neglected it as men aſleepe, neither could it be diſcerned vntill it did appeare in a blade. Secondly the Apoſtle likewiſe hath reſembled corrupt and erroneous ſpeeches vnto a 2. Tim. 2. 17. 
                     creeping-canker, which is a diſeaſe in mans bodie, gathering vpon a man by little and little from ioynt to ioynt, vntill it haue corrupted the vitall parts. Theſe are but lights of compariſons, to ſhew the beginning and progreſſe of an alteration. Now ſhall we animate this Idaea by
               
               
                  Pregnant examples of changes in doctrines, the certaine originals whereof cannot be directly ſhewed.
                  SECT. 3.
                  4 Leſt that our Aduerſaries may complaine, that we giue them ſimilitudes without examples as it were ſoules without bodies, we exhibite vnto them examples from Scriptures, from Fathers, and from their owne Church.
                  
                     
5 When the Phariſees tempted Chriſt in the queſtion of diuorce, aſking, Matth. 19. 3. The queſtions were two: 1. whether it is lawfull? the ſecond to confirme it lawfull: elſe Why did Moſes ſuffer it? Chriſt anſwereth both: Moſes ſuffered it for the hardneſſe of your hearts: but to the other, It was not ſo, that is, not thought 
                              〈◊〉

                           ll from the beginning. 
                     Whether is it lawfull for a man to put away his wife vpon euerie occaſion? Our Sauiour anſwered, ſaying, (verſ. 8.) From the beginning it was not ſo: reprouing the common error of the lewes by teſtimonie of antiquity, from the word of God, Gen. 2. 24. For this cauſe ſhall a man leaue father and mother, and cleaue vnto his wife, and they two ſhall be one fleſh.
                  
                  6 Here our Romaniſts would haue taught the Phariſees to reply vpon Chriſt, thus: If you conuince vs of error, you muſt ſhew vs, when this aroſe in the Church of God, who firſt taught it, and what perſon reſiſted it; or elſe this contrarie cuſtome muſt be maintained as diuine, and from the beginning. But the wiſdome of Chriſt ſeemeth to condemne this reaſon of folly, when paſſing ouer the originall of this cuſtome (although haply iſſuing from time before a thouſand generations of mankind) he is contented with the reuealed will of God in the beginning of truth, In the beginning it was not ſo: plainly teaching vs, that we are not bound, for the confutation of errour, to a poſitiue demonſtration of the beginning thereof, but that it is ſufficient to deliuer a negatiue, ſhewing a time when it was not. We are not deſtitute of examples in this kind taken from former Churches, ſuch as is the

Firſt they yeeld vnto vs that the communion of both bread & wine is by antiquitie from Chriſt his inſtitution. Secondly by continuance, it endured the ſpace of a thouſand yeares. Thirdly, by conſent vniuerſall in all Churches Chriſtiā, yet in the Romane profeſſion hath bene altered by a contrarie and generall practiſe of the people, they know not either when, where, or by whom. Fourthly, they diſcerne it to haue crept in (not vnlike a cold takē at the feete) by the peoples deuotion, and not by violence. Fiftly, the opportunitie, whilest as Paſtors winked at it, and therefore it found no publicke reſiſtance, but preuailed by a decretiue accordance. Which one example we haue propounded as ſufficient for a taſte and trial of that our Aduerſaries incomparable boldneſſe in this their challenge, exacting of vs the particular inſtances of time, place, and perſons, both as authors and reſiſters vnto euery notorious change: which challenge will hereafter be confuted by many examples of confeſſed nouelties throughout the moſt points of doctrines, which are now controuerted betweene the Proteſtants and Romaniſts.

And ſo it muſt needs be, becauſe as there muſt be firſt iron, before there can be ruſt which cankereth the iron; ſo muſt there be a virgine truth, before error, which is nothing elſe but an adulteration thereof. So that primum and verum, that is, primarie antiquitie and truth are both inſeparable twins, begot and bred in the ſame inſtant. Yet as the firſt ſeduction of mankind did ſhortly follow the integrity of his firſt creation, ſo ſometime the difference betweene error and truth, in reſpect of time, hath bene no more then as wheate in the day, and tares in the ſame night: which made S. Cyprian ſay, that there is vetuſtas erroris, and Tertullian noteth ſome hereſies to haue bene Tertul. praeſcript.

                  11 Our Sauiour Chriſt by reforming the corrupt doctrine of diuorce, (which was ancienter then Moſes) by a more ancient conſtitution, euen of that which was 
                        Matth. 19. 
                     ab initio, that is, from the beginning, did teach vs wiſely to diſtinguiſh of Antiquity, that one is primitiue and hereditary, the other adoptiue, of an after inuention. Concerning theſe two, the ancient (and herein generally approued) Fathers haue giuen vs their preſcriptions.
                  12 For they conſider the Si haec ita ſunt, conſtat proinde omnem doctrinam, quae cum illis Eccleſijs Apoſtolicis matricibus & originalibus fidei conſpiret, veritati deputandā: & ſine dubio tenentes quod Eccleſiae ab Apoſtolis, Apoſtoli à Chriſto, Chriſtus à Deo ſuſcepit, reliquam verò omnem doctrinam de mendacio praeiudicandam, quae ſapiat contra veritatem Eccleſiarum, & Apoſtolorum, & Chriſti, & Dei.

that is, from the holy Apoſtles, & was preſerued à viris Apoſtolicis, that is, by the next ſucceſſors of the Apoſtles: and they hold all other doctrines to be preiudicial vnto the faith. But what if after the Apoſtles any one Paſtor in the Church ſhall aſſume to himſelfe a power to preſcribe any new doctrine vnto the Church? Such an one (which choaketh the Romiſh preſumption concerning the infallibility of iudgement in one Pope ouer the whole Church,) is to be eſteemed, by the ſentence of Lirinenſis, for Et ne quis forſitan praetermiſſis caeteris, ſe ſolùm audiri, ſibi ſoli credi arrogaret, paulò poſt ait, (1.

No, but euery ſuch Church Ad hanc formam prouocabuntur ab illis Eccleſijs, quae licet nullum ex Apoſtolis vel Apoſtolicis authorem ſuum proferant, vt multò poſteriores, quae denique quotidiè inſtituuntur; tamen in eadem fide conſpirantes, non minùs Apoſtolicae deputantur, pro conſanguinitate doctrinae.

                     Anathema vnto the iudgemēt of the primitiue Church, attributing vnto it the right and authoritie of aſſigning and determining what is the perfect Canon of Scriptures. But this doctrine is impugned by their D. Stapleton, ſaying, that Quod ad iudicium, determinationem, & approbationem Scripturarum canonicarum attinet, eius authoritatem penes praeſentem Eccleſiam eſſe, non ſecùs quàm penes Apoſtolos fuit. Stapleton. doctrin. princip. lib. 9. cap. 12. 
                     there is no leſſe authority in the preſent Church (meaning, of Rome) for determining and approuing the true bookes of the Bible, then there was in the Apoſtles themſelues.
                  
                  2 This poſition once granted, a gap is preſently opened for a legion of profane nouelties to inuade and ſurprize the Church of God. For if that in this and the like determinations of any truth, it ſhal be ſufficient to ſay, This is defined by the now Church, which is of equall authoritie with the primitiue Church: when will it be but a matter prepoſterous, and indeed ridiculous for Proteſtants (according to the former preſcriptions ſet downe by Tertullian and Vincentius Lirinenſis) to appeale vnto the iudgement of Antiquitie, and to pleade for any truth from the euidence of the primitiue Church?
                  3 But we ſhall let our Reader perceiue the diſſimulated vant of antiquity vnmasked, by diſcouering of the noueltie and profaneneſſe of this one new poſition, whereby the law of antiquitie is ſo notably obſcured and buried.

                     not condemne them of raſhneſſe, but of ignorance. Wherin Canus himſelf may ſeeme to incurre the iuſt reprehenſion not of ignorance, but of raſhneſſe: for who can be induced to thinke that the principall Doctors of the Romiſh Church could be ignorāt of the iudgement therof (eſpecially concerning the Canon of holy Scriptures, which are the chiefe principles and foundation of Catholicke faith) if in their time this now Romiſh doctrine had bin thē held for a Catholike doctrine?

he) this matter was not throughly diſcuſſed and decided vntill the Councell of Trent: before which time the forenamed Doctors (as Cardinall Bellarmine ſaith) followed the iudgement of S. Hierome therein, according vnto the Hebrew Canon of the Bible.
                  
                  8 So that the now Romiſh Church, impoſing an Anathema vpon euery one, who ſhall not acknowledge the ſixe Apocryphall bookes for Canonical, doth diſplay her ſelfe to be degenerated from her owne, and from the Catholike truth; as by the catalogues of Scriptures recorded in the Apoſtolicall mother Churches for 400 yeares hath appeared, and alſo for the ſpace of many hundred yeares moe, as by the confeſſed examples of S. Gregory, & other their choiſe and approued Doctors, hath bene ſenſibly confirmed. Whereby the greenneſſe of this firſt and great Innouation doth bewray itſelfe.

10 It will delight our Reader, to vnderſtand how cunningly their Cardinall Bellarmine ſeeketh to expedite and free himſelfe out of theſe ſtraits: he faineth that S. Hierome made a tranſlation, which afterwards he corrected: and when it is demanded, Why then doth the Church of Rome rather embrace the former tranſlation of Hierome, then his correction? he anſwereth, that

Hieronym. in quaeſt. & lib. de opt. gen. interp. & alibi, docet aliter fuiſſe vertenda: igitur fieri non poteſt vt Editio noſtra ſit ipſa Tranſlatio, quam Hieron. fecerat ex Hebraeo. Reſpondeo,—quarta cauſa eſt, quia etſi B Hieron. interdum ſenſerit quaedam mutanda in ſua verſione, & ea notauerit in ſuis cōmentarijs: tamen Eccleſia poſtea magis iudicauit veram primam verſionem, & eam retinere maluit in Editione vulgata.

                     the Church thought the firſt tranſlation to be the better. Which was in effect, the anſwer of their Dorpius, whom Sir Thomas Moore therefore confuted, ſaying, Hieronyn. ianam Tranſlationem primam corrigentem non admittimus, M. Dorpius epiſt. apud Thomam Morum. Quod Hieronyn. us iudicauit potiſſimum, ab eo tu potiſſimùm deterres. Thom. Morus epiſt. ad eundem, ibid.
                      
                     Thou takest that for the worſe, which S. Hierome iudged to be the better. And ſo muſt any iudge, who will not impute vnto S. Hierome dotage in his corrections, which (as an Oedipus Colonaeus) are ſufficient arguments in themſelues by their excellent learning to free him from that imputation. We choofe rather to beleeue their more ſincere Authors, 
                        See aboue lit. e, f. who haue denied it to be Hieroms tranſlation, but rather of ſome ſilly Graectan, or, of they know not whom. Which muſt enforce the Apologiſts, who challenge of vs an expreſſe mention of the firſt perſons, time, and place of Innouations, to aſſigne when, where, and by whom their common tranſlation was firſt framed and altered; or elſe confeſſe, that ſuch like circumſtantiall changes of former times may not now be exacted.

                  11 As that figure is more properly called ancient, which receiueth the impreſſion immediatly from life, then that which is drawne but by imitation of a former example; ſo a tranſlation of Scripture, which is directly taken (this is the profeſſion of Proteſtants) from the Hebrew or Greeke originals, is to be iudged truly ancient, rather then that which is but tranſlated out of a Latine tranſlation, ſuch as are all their new Bibles (as for example the Rhemiſh) which are permitted by the Church, and do not immediately follow the Greeke edition, (for of the Hebrew we 
                        See aboue lib. 3 cap. 1. §. 2. & cap. 16. §. 3. and in this Chap. Sect. 1. &c.
                      haue alreadie diſputed) but that which the Romaniſts call 
                        See aboue Sect. 2. vntruly Hieroms tranſlation; and is fraught with many old corruptions.
                  12 Our Aduerſaries the Rhemiſts are priuiledged to iuſtifie their act, by telling vs, that the vulgar tranſlation (which they follow in their Engliſh Teſtament)

                     is not onely better then all other Latine, but euen then the Greeke text it ſelfe, in thoſe places where they diſagree: the proofe hereof (ſay they) is euident, becauſe moſt of the ancient heretikes were Graecians; and therefore the Scriptures were corrupted by them, as ancient Fathers often complaine. And ſo they would alſo auouch of their tranſlations of the old Teſtament (if they had any) in reſpect of the Hebrew text.

Then preuenting an obiection, which is commonly made from the teſtimonies of ſome Fathers, in their cenſures of the Greeke copies, he concludeth from the expreſſe ſentence of S. Hierome, thus: Whereſoeuer (ſaith Hierome) there is any varietie in the Latine tranſlations of the new Teſtament, we muſt conſult with the Greeke text, wherein the Scripture was first written. And leſt any might except (as the Rhemiſts haue done) that the Greeke text, which is now in vſe, hath bene, ſince thoſe ancient times of Hierome, greatly corrupted, and infected with hereticall additions, or ſubtractions, the ſame their learned Senenſis further auerieth, that Dicimus cum Graecum codicem, qui nunc

                      Aduerſaries bring any inſtance of moment vnto the contrarie. Hitherto we haue a generall notion of this point.
                  14 If we may haue leaue to deſcend vnto particulars, in examination of the Romiſh Latine tranſlation, (whereof the Rhemiſts haue auouched ſaying, that the Greeke text it ſelfe is to be corrected by the vulgar Latine in thoſe places where they diſagree: we ſhall readily proue, not by Proteſtants, but by Romaniſts, not of common, but of ſingular note, that their vulgar Latine (not that which was commanded by the Councel of Trent to be purged, but that which ſince hath bene lately reuiewed, corrected, & publiſhed for the perfect Latine copie, by Pope Biblia ſacra vulgatae Editionis, Sixti Quinti Pontificis Maximi iuſſu recognita, & Clementis 8. authoritate edita.

                     Then (ſaith the ſame Cardinal,) the Chriſtians did all ſing Pſalmes together, and anſwer Amen, becauſe they were yet but few; but afterward when the number of Christians was multiplied, the office of ſaying publike Seruice was diuided, and it was left onely vnto the Clerke to celebrate the Commonpraiers. Here he granteth an alteration, but how? Hac in re mirum eſt, quàm mutata ſit Eccleſiae conſuetudo. Eraſmus in 1. Cor. 14.

                  33 Our Reader need not to be moued to conſider theſe points. Firſt, a confeſſed antiquitie of the peoples praying vnderſtandingly both in the old Teſtament before Chriſt, and after his coming, in the new: both in the daies of the Apostles, and after vntill the daies of S. Hi

                  34 Secondly, that after theſe times this cuſtome was altered: here is a change, but why? Their Cardinal rendreth no better reaſon thē 
                     becauſe (ſaith he) the people began to increaſe; which reaſon is found to be both Falſe: for in the dayes of S. Hierome and S. Chryſoſtome (in whoſe time this cuſtome is ſaid to haue bene continued) the congregations of Chriſtian people in publicke Seruice were as frequent as euer ſince: for S. Hierome hath bene brought in by Durantus (lit. h.) commending the congregatitus in Rome for ſtudium & frequentia: and Chryſoſt. doth ioy much in the great concourſe of people vnto the Churches.

                           tter for many, as for a few to learne to ſay, Amen. fooliſh. Thirdly, that when we would know the time and actors of this change, we are anſwered with a mirum eſt, that is, It is a maruell how this change came in. This maketh the former challenge of the Apologiſts appeare to be ridiculous,

wherein they (contrarie to experience both in this, and infinite other alterations) haue exacted of vs a demonſtration of perſons, time, & place, for the proofe of our obiected changes: eſpecially ſeeing that here Rome herſelfe is now confeſſed to haue altered her profeſſion in a principall and neceſſarie point of religion; and yet cannot ſhew vs either by whom, or when ſhe made this Innouation.
                  35 Haue we ſaid, that it is a principall and neceſſarie point of, Chriſtian Religion? Yes verily; and this will be worthie our due conſideration, the rather becauſe in the ſtate of the controuerſie, the difference betweene the Proteſtants and Romaniſts is thus laied: the Romaniſts teach onely a licere, ſcil. that it is lawfull for the Church to vſe the publike Seruice in the natiue and knowne language of Chriſtian people: Proteſtants furthermore contend for a debere, ſcil. that it thus ought to be; and are for this poſition anathematized in their laſt Councell. And yet how eaſily, to our Aduerſaries bluſh, might the neceſſitie hereof be euineed? But we confine our ſelues within the bounds of a confeſſed equitie. Now then to the point it ſelfe.
                  36 Although this confeſſed Apoſtolicall, and primitiue antiquitie doth, euen in that name, carie with it a ſufficient proofe of the equitie of our profeſſion, teaching a neceſſary vſe of a language commonly vnderſtood of the people, in the publike worſhip of God; yet will this be much more perſwaſible by the confeſſed properties of knowne praier: for our Aduerſaries haue condeſcended to grant, that, if we reſpect the good of them that pray, the knowne prayer is more behoouefull for the peoples

                  37 If we regard the Apoſtles doctrine concerning the Common prayer in the Church, it is certaine that he wil haue the congregation to ſay, Amen, which is to yeeld their open & expreſſe conſent vnto the publike prayer: but of the ignorant of the language of prayer, he ſaith, 1.

                     How ſhall he ſay Amen, when he prayeth he knoweth not what? becauſe he vnderſtandeth not, quid boni dicas, but onely quòd benedicas, and therefore Optandum videtur, vt iuxtà Apoſtolicum mandatum, & priſcum Eccleſiae morem in publicis Eccleſiae precibus, cantionibus, & lectionibus, quae populi causâ ſuſcipiuntur, populi ratio habeatur, neque in totum ac perpetuò ab omni communione precum arceatur.

                     when the Pope and his Cardinals were in deliberation, whether they ſhould yeeld vnto the requeſt of the Sclauonians, who deſired to haue their praiers in their countrey language, he was moued to conſent, by hearing an Oracle anſwering, Let euery ſpirit praiſe the Lord: which voice (as Caſſander hath well noted) doth as well command a liberty for all people:) or by the acknowledged poperties of knowne praiers, to wit, the more edification, more conſolation, more deuotion in the worſhippers of God; which conſequently do auaile vnto the better worſhipping of God both in ſpirit and truth: how then ſhall not the Romane Church be iudged an Innouator, which hath ſo ſtrangely departed from ſo Apoſtolical, primitiue, equall and neceſſarie a point of Chriſtian religion?

                  2 The firſt is in aſſuming to be Vnicus: for as their Cardinall Bellarmine cannot denie but that Eccleſia eſt vna & eadē omni tempore: non debet igitur mutari forma regiminis. Bell. lib. 2. de Pont. ca. 12. §. Secūdò ex.

                     whereas in the firſt founding of Chriſtian Churches, a ſupreme power was cōmunicated vnto all the chiefe builders; yet (ſaith he) as ſoone as the Apoſtles were dead, the Apoſtolicall authority did abide onely in the ſucceſſor of S. Peter, meaning the Pope. And can many and one, a common and a proper, that and another be without alteration?

                     The manner hereof (ſaith their Victoria) which is now in vſe, is not from diuine authority, becauſe the order of Cardinals, by whom he is choſen, is not ordained by God.

As for the Scripture which they alledge, it is (as their owne Ieſuite Azorius ſheweth) childiſhly Locus 1. Reg. 2.

But afterwards whē Pope Boniface the third, Anno 605. had obtained of the Emperour Phocas, the prerogatiue of headſhip ouer all other Biſhops, then began he to aduance his ſenate of thoſe Cardinall Prieſts, whom he drew nearer vnto himſelfe for the publike gouernment of the Church; and thus by little and little they aſcended vnto their preſent dignity.

I know ſome learned Biſhops, who ſtanding vpon their gentility, for ſooth, and greatneſſe, hold it a matter of ſeruitude and baſeneſſe to be exerciſed in preaching, becauſe their predeceſſors were not accuſtomed thereunto: and thus pretend onely diſuſe.

But happie had it bene to all Chriſtendome, if they had bene as willing to reforme their doctrines according vnto the forme of pure antiquities: for then ſhould we not find (as is confeſſed) the Popes ancient ſubiection acknowledged vnto Emperors, changed into a Soueraigntie aboue them; their being confirmed in their elections by the Emperours, aboliſhed; and an authoritie of confirming the election of Emperours, vſurped: the paying of tribute vnto Emperours ceaſed, and their exaction of tributes, contrarie to the will of Emperours, intruded: their ſubmiſſion vnto the penall decrees of Emperours buried; & the arming of ſubiects vnto rebellion againſt Emperours, defended. Finally, the Popes honouring of Emperours with the titles of my Lord, &c. aboliſhed, and the abaſing of Emperours euen to the kiſſing of their feete, authorized and practized. Can our Aduerſaries require either more notorious or more obnoxious alteratiōs, than theſe appeare to be, whoſe firſt authors and times haue bene by our Aduerſaries themſelues ſo throughly diſcouered?

                     Of other confeſſed Romiſh Innouations in the doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation: of the witholding the cup from the people: of not breaking of the bread: of reſtraining men from taking it with their hands.

                     SVperſtition is an Hagarine, which is naturally more fruitfull then is the truly eſpouſed religious profeſſion: which may be diſcerned in all points of worſhip, but eſpecially doth it diſcouer it ſelfe in the Sacrament of the Euchariſt. The firſt point (which hath bene mentioned) is the new Romiſh Tranſubſtantiation, founded (in their opinion) vpon thoſe words of Chriſt, This is my bodie: 
                     Scotus lib 4. Sent diſt. 11. q. 3 apertè docet neque ex Scripturae, neque ex Patrum ſententijs nos adigi, vt Tranſubſtantiationem ſtatuamus:—Immò ingenuè Scotus hanc fidem.— 
                     Which ſence (ſaith their Scotus) we cannot be brought to beleeue, either by any plaine place of Scripture, or ſentence of ancient Fathers. What need we more? Yet Scripture is ſo little fauourable vnto their expoſition, as that their Ex ſolo Rom. Eccleſiae decreto (cui in hac reſtare oporteat) eſſe introductam.— Scotus, Caietanus in 3.

Hoſpin. ibid. pag. 411. Biel profeſſe, that except they had bene preoccupated

by the interpretation of the Romiſh Church, they could not haue yeelded vnto it. And the iudgement of the ancient Church of Chriſt is ſo fully repugnant thereunto, that Eraſmus doubted not to call Tranſubſtantiation a doctrine

Whereby we (notwithſtanding the oppoſite interpretations) may collect this meaning of Antiquitie, viz. that the reall things which are receiued, are to be expounded by the ſymbols and ſignes of receiuing: but the ſacramentall manner of adminiſtration doth expreſſe the ſeparation of Chriſts body crucified, from the bloud which was ſhed; and our diſtinct maner of eating and drinking, doth explicate the two parts of our ſpirituall refection in his bodie and bloud: ſo that the doctrine of concomitancy confounding theſe diſtinct ſignes and obiects of the Euchariſt, may ſeeme to contradict the iudgement of innumerable ancients. Finally, our Doctor hath painted out Aquinas (who liued about the yeare 1300.) for the

                     Eleuation of the hoaſt (as it it now vſed in the Church of Rome either, before or after conſecration) cannot be proued to haue bene inſtituted by Chriſt in his laſt ſupper: nor that Chriſt did offer therein either See ibid. 
                     a Sacrifice properly propitiatorie, yea or a proper Sacrifice of his corporall preſence. Which example of Chriſt being the archetypon of all Catholike antiquity, may be our ward againſt our Aduerſaries exceptions to the contrarie: according vnto the practiſe of their Cardinall Bellarmine, who reiected ſome points in old Liturgies, which caried in them a colour of antiquitie, euen

                  2 Whileſt as the Romiſh Prieſt doth appropriate the cup vnto himſelfe, and ſecludeth Chriſtian people from it, his ſacramentall communion (as hath bene confeſſed) is but an halfe adminiſtration: but when moreouer he vſeth that, which they call a priuate Maſſe, Miſſa priuata dicitur aliquando quae ſit, nimirùm, in loco priuato, licet aliâ in ſignificatione ea dicitur, in qua ſolus (Sacerdos) celebrans communicat. Lorinus Ieſ. in Act. 2. 46. 
                     wherein (as their Ieſuite deſcribeth it) the Prieſt alone doth participate the Sacrament, this turneth the communion into no communion at all. And herein their Prieſthood (we thinke) doth contradict the rule of prieſtly And the Lord ſaid, Who is a faithfull ſteward and wiſe, whom the maiſter ſhall make ruler ouer his houſhold, to giue them their portion of meate in due ſeaſon. Luc. 12. 42. 
                     ſtewardſhip, wherby the Miniſter is appointed to giue vnto Chriſt his family their due portion. Againſt this kind of violation of the Sacramēt, Antiquity hath cried aloud frō the mouths of our Romiſh Aduerſaries themſelues.

                     The thing it ſelfe ſpeaketh, that not onely Prieſts, but Deacons, and common people vſed anciently to communicate together both in the Greeke and Latine Church; and how this is ceaſſed (ſaith he) it is to be maruelled. But why ſhould any maruell hereat? for their Cochlaeus doth tell vs, that Cochlaeus de Sacrificio Miſſae. Quod, inquit, olim tam frequentes non fuerint Miſae, inde accidiſſe arbitror, quod olim omnes tum Sacerdotes, tum Laici quicunque intererant ſacrificio Miſſae, peracta oblatione, cum ſacrificante communicabant: ſicut ex Can. Apoſt. & ex libris atque epiſt. antiquiſſimorum Eccleſiae Doctorum perſpicuè cognoſcitur.—Tum adiungit: Nunc verò poſtquam Communionis ordo à nobis obſeruari deſijt, idque propter negligentiam atque ſocordiam tam plebis quàm Sacerdotum, Spiritus ſanctus Miſſas priuatas celebrando, pium remedium huic defectui inuenit. Teſte Hoſpiniano lib. 4. hiſt. Sacram. pag. 330. 331. 
                     where as anciently, as appeareth both by the Apostolicall Canons, and the ancient writings of the Doctors of the Church, all the Prieſts and people preſent at the Sacrifice, did communicate together: yet ſince this order ceaſſed through the negligence and ſlothfulneſſe both of Prieſts and people.

                     Well it were, (ſaith Hoffmeiſteius) and we ought to endeuour it, that ſome remedie might be had. But Rome once erring (which is the bottomleſſe pit of errour) will not turne her necke aſide to ſee her owne errour, and to acknowledge it.

Is not here a confeſſed matter of moment, the celebratiō of a Sacrament? Is there not a notable change, a cōmunion into no communion? ſhall we not iudge it heinous, which their owne Authors cannot but deplore? muſt it not be called notorious, which their owne Canon doth daily contradict? Yet in this moſt certaine change what greater vncertaintie of the direct time, and inuenters, than when our Aduerſaries in ſhewing the cauſe why it crept into the Church, are compelled to maruell at the manner, how?

                     the eating and drinking of the Sacrament is the vſe thereof; therefore Chriſt, when he had conſecrated it, he did furthermore giue it vnto his Diſciples, not that they ſhould honourably reſerue it, but that they ſhould by eating it, be made partakers of the fruite thereof.

                     Miſſals aſcribed vnto S. Ambroſe, and S. Gregory, for to know whether forme ſhould be rather admitted vniuerſally in the Church: they put the triall hereof vnto a miracle, intending to preferre that which God by ſome reuelation ſhould rather approue. To this end they c 
                     lay them vpon the altar, locke the doores, and expect ſome viſible token of diſcerning them, from God. In the morning behold S. Ambroſes lieth on the table, as they left it, but S. Gregories is found diſſolued into parts, which were here and there ſcattered: whereby they were inſtructed from God (ſaith their Author,) that the Miſſall of S. Ambroſe was to be vſed onely in his Church, but the other of S. Gregory was to be diſperſed and exerciſed throughout the world.
                  
                  14 This Legend we haue propounded, not in an opinion of the truth therof, but to notifie how prone our Aduerſaries are to preferre that which is the leſſe ancient, & that alſo vpon a ſilly conceit; becauſe, forſooth, it was found diſſolued and diſperſed: which by the Scripture phraſe ſhould haue rather perſwaded them that God did reiect it as abhominable, according as it is written, 
                        Deut. 28. Diſperget eum Deus. & Pſal. 88. Diſperget inimicos. & Pſal. 91. Diſpergentur, qui operantur iniquitatem.

                  15 But be their forme of Maſſe and Liturgie old or new, call they it as they pleaſe, Ambroſian or Gregorian (the latter whereof is confeſſed to haue bene in Gregory his time,

                     inuented by heretikes. Theſe are vgly Innouations poſſeſſing the parts of their ſolemne worſhip: but can the Apologiſts tell when, and how they crept in, or by whom then they were preſently reſiſted? If they can ſhew vs a due reſiſtance, how then haue they remained in their Liturgies? If they cannot demonſtrate theſe changes accordingly, then are they but vnequall diſputants, who preſcribe vnto others rules and properties of change, which they will not acknowledge, when they are obiected againſt themſelues. e Quodſi noſtra conſpiceret (Agobertus Lugdun.

                     Of other confeſſed Innouations in the doctrines of Free-will, and Merit: and againſt Sola fides.
                  SECT. 1.
                  
                     THE free-will of man was, in the integritie of mans nature, indeed, a free-borne, and had a naturall abilitie in it ſelfe to conſent vnto good: but after the firſt fall of that one man (in whoſe loynes all mankind tooke an hereditary limpe, and rebellious diſpoſition) it became a bondſlaue of ſinne, and of c Ibid. Sect. 5. lit. 0. the Diuell, and, in reſpect of any perfect good, altogether a dead creature. As d Quibus argumentis infideles ad certam Eccleſiae notitiam induci poſſint.

Secundum, lex illa, quae excellentiora opera charitatis proximo impendere iubet, magis eſt digna nomine Eccleſiae. Salmeron Ieſ. in ep. Pauli in genere, diſp. 2. §. Sed iam. pag. 180. for the Romaniſts, who haue attributed vnto the naturall man an indifferent power of conſenting or diſſenting vnto good, they haue bene repulſed by the poſitions of their owne Doctors, which teach from the iudgement of ancient Fathers: firſt, that there is a 
                        See aboue lib. 1 cap. 10. Sect. 9. lit. e. in marg.
                      
                     phyſicall motion in the exciting grace. Secondly, that the 
                        Ibid. Sect. 10. lit. a. in marg.
                      
                     will is not the principall agent in the act of conſent vnto good, becauſe it is but an inſtrument of grace. Thirdly, that grace doth determinate the will.
                  
                  2 In this cauſe we hold it furthermore very obſeruable, which their Ieſuite Salmeron hath commendably publiſhed to the confutation of infidelitie. The firſt argument (ſaith he) for proofe of a true Church, is, that it performeth a more inuiolable worſhip, and that it doth more depreſſe the pride of mans nature, yeelding leſſe vnto his naturall power. Now whether this note may not iuſtifie Proteſtants, in reſpect of the Romaniſts, as it doth the Romaniſts, in compariſon of infidels (although not in an equall degree,) the wiſedome of our Chriſtian Reader will eaſily diſcerne by this controuerſie concerning Free-will.
                  
                  3 From their opinion of Free-will their doctrine of Merit hath had an originall: both that which they call de congruo, which many of their owne teachers haue termed a 
                        See aboue lib. 3 cap. 9. Sect. 3. 
                     new inuention, and contrarie vnto the iudgement of ancient Doctors; as alſo the other, which they name de condigno, which their learned Schoolemen, as namely, Waldenſis and Pigghius, together with diuerſe other principall Readers in their Schooles, haue iudged to be 
                        See aboue lib. 2 ca. 11. Sect. 8. 
                     no vniuerſall or Catholicke, and conſequently no ancient doctrine.
                  
                  4 An other principall queſtion there is concerning ſola fides, that is, faith onely iuſtifieth; whereby is not ſignified, that faith is alone in a iuſtified man (for a iuſtifying faith 
                        Galat. 5. 6. 
                     worketh by loue;) but that it is the onely gift of grace, which is ordained as the hand of the regenerate ſoule, to apprehend and apply the remiſſion of ſinnes, by the vertue of Chriſt his paſſion, whereby onely a ſinner is iuſtified before Gods tribunall. Hereof Eraſmus hath truly thus affirmed: Haec vox [Sola] tot clamoribus lapidata hoc ſeculo in Luthero, reuerenter legitur & auditur in Patribus, Eraſmus, as he is cited by Lubbertus de Eccleſ. lib. 5. cap. 2. pag. 247. 
                     Sola fides, which (ſaith he) is ſtoned to death in Luther, (meaning, by the Romaniſts) is reuerently heard and receiued from the ancient Fathers. Doubtleſſe; for if they had a due and reuerend eſteeme of the ſence of

the Fathers in their ſola fides, they could not be ſo cenſorious, as to command in the Proteſtants

                     Of other confeſſed Romiſh Innouations, as namely, in their doctrine of Purgatorie, Indulgences, Iubilees, vertue of Holy-water, and neceſsitie of auricular Confeſſion.

                     WE ſhall need but onely to point at their Innouation in their article of beliefe concerning Romiſh Purgatorie, becauſe it hath bene alreadie handled at large: where our Aduerſaries themſelues haue obſerued a 
                        See aboue lib. 1 cap 2. Sect. 14. 
                     none, or very rare mention thereof in the Greeke Fathers: a no generall apprehenſion thereof, at the firſt, in the Latine Church: a no profeſsion of that doctrine in the Greek Church vnto this day: but to haue crept into credite by little and little. Can they poſſibly auouch that doctrine to be ancient, which was not taught at the firſt? or Catholicke, which ſometime was not vniuerſally beleeued in the Church of Chriſt? or true, which is diſcerned to be but a creeper into their Creed?
                  2 Seeing then that their article of Purgatorie is but of ſo young faith, their doctrine of Indulgences, queſtionleſſe, cannot be old: becauſe (as their Biſhop Roffenſis hath rightly obſerued)

                     Indulgences (ſaith he) may not therfore be thought worthy of contempt,
                     
                     becauſe the vſe of them hath bene taken vp but of late; for poſteritie vnderſtandeth many things, which their anceſtors neuer knew: which is the cauſe why Purgatorie was not beleeued in the Greeke Church vnto this day. To this end he compareth the knowledge of the primitiue Church vnto the light of the grey morning, which hath but a dimme ſhine, & by progreſſe of time waxeth clearer. What is this but a kind of Anabaptiſticall infatuation, arrogating to theſe laſt times a greater illumination then was vouchſafed to the primitiue Church?
                  4 And yet againe, It is no maruell (ſaith he) though we ſhould find no mention of Indulgences, eſpecially among the ancients, becauſe their charity was ſeruent, and had leſſe need of Indulgences than we, among whom it is become ſo cold. Thus much their Caſtro. By this ſuppoſall he hath darkned and almoſt dammed vp the light of antiquitie vpon a new preſumption of a better and clearer reuelation of truth in the twy-light, or rather moone ſhine of theſe later times, and (which argueth a greater ſoleciſmein diuinity) they hereby perſwade men to thinke, that when charitie is leſſe hote, then it pleaſed God to ſend a larger vſe of Indulgences and pardons; wherby (as hath bene confeſſed)

                     BEfore that we intreate of the adoring of God in a picture, we are to enquire into the picturing of God, to know whether the Church may allow of any viſible Image of the inuiſible God, in our ſpirituall worſhip. Maiſter Caluine hath called this kinde of Imagerie Quarta opimo eſt Caluini, vbi dicit primò, nefas eſſe Deo inuiſibili & incorporeo imaginem viſibilem & corpoream collocare. Bellar lib. 2. de imag.

And Albulenſis. one of theſe liued an hundred yeares before Caluine. But was not Caluine herein a Catholicke? If this were to be tried by Scripture,

it is plaine by the voice of God, commanding his people not to make any ſimilitude of him: why? Thou ſaweſt no likneſſe (ſaith God) but heardſt only a voice. Can any man paint a voice? or ſhall a bodie reſemble a ſpirit, or a viſible figure notifie an inuiſible Eſſence, without a lye?

The experience likewiſe of all former times is anſwerable hereunto, for in this ſort haue the old hereſies of the Grecians and Latines bene diſcouered, and

Alſo their deniall of prayer for the dead was begun by Aërius, and contradicted in him by Auſtin, haer. 53. and by Epiphanius, haer. 75. And yet afterwards in both theſe doctrines they conformed themſelues to Rome, as is reported by M. Sparke vbi ſupra, and by Oſiander Cent. 15. pag. 477. and by Criſpinus vbi ſupra, pag 451. In like manner their defence of mariage of Prieſts was contradicted againſt Theodorus by Chryſoſtom. in epiſt. 6 ad Theodorum Monachum: and againſt certaine other by Epiphanius haer. 59. ante med.

                  THE PROTESTANTS APPEALE.
                  SECT. 1.
                  
                     THe ſumme of all this, and of the next Section may be reduced vnto this ſyllogiſme. All notorious changes in Religion, haue receiued preſent and open reſiſtances and reprehenſions. But the Church of Rome (ſay they) hath not bene openly reſiſted in the opinions, which are laid vnto her charge. Ergo, ſhe hath not committed in them any notorious alteration. The propoſition they labour to fortifie by Scripture, and by experience.
                  2 The ſence of Scripture is not to be applied vniuerſally, but 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , that is, for the moſt part: for in the ancient Church we haue heard of the doctrine of the See aboue. 
                     Millenarij, held by Irenaeus, and other fathers of their time; and of the doctrine of (that we may ſo terme them) Paideuchariſtitae, defending the neceſſitie of the adminiſtration of the Euchariſt vnto children, whereof Pope 
                        See aboue lib. 2 cap. 13. §. 3. 
                     Innocentius was a principall patrone: both which opinions are now condemned as new and erroneous by our Aduerſaries themſelues; which notwithſtanding paſſed for currant in their times, not onely without reſiſtance, but euen with the approbation of the chiefe Paſtors of the Church. Like as there happened a notable alteration in the ſucceſſion of their Popedome, when notwithſtanding there was ſo little reſiſtance made againſt the intruders into the cl
                        •
                     aire of Rome, that their Cardinall Baronius deploring the miſerie of that vſurpation, feared not to ſay, that then 
                        See below Sect. 3. a. 
                     all Chriſts diſciples were aſleepe; as either not able, or not daring to contradict ſo notorious Innouation.
                  
                  3 Their confirmation from experience is leſſe probable: for reſiſtance is a word of mutuall dependance and reciprocation, as appeareth in the two grand Barators and common ſuiters in the law, Stile, and Oake; the one is the plaintife, the other the defendant; each doth reſiſt the other in the queſtion of right, and the matter in the end is referred vnto the Iudge, who is to diſcerne whether of theſe parties is erroneous: but how? Not by the beginning of open reſiſtance, but by the light of their euidence, and the letter of the law. So in religion, reſiſtance, which is a pro and contra, is no ſufficient conuiction of errour by it ſelfe.
                  4 Secondly, in their aſſumption, pretending that no example can be giuen of reſistance againſt any alteration of religion in the Church of Rome, they call for ſome examples hereof more inſtantly in their next Section: therefore we being troubled with abundance of thoſe inſtances which haue bene See aboue. related, will ſingle out onely two of theſe which the Apologiſts haue here propounded for the ground of their contrarie experience, viz. the Grecians, and Luther.
                  
                  5 Many reſiſtances made againſt the Greeke Church in ſeuerall doctrines, haue bene See aboue. before obiected by the Apologiſts, and by vs, in the moſt particulars, confuted; which now againe they recapitulate, burthening a whole page with the repetition of them: ſhewing themſelues hereby nimiùm diligentes, euen ſeriouſly ſuperfluous. That which firſt we haue ſelected out of

many, is the example of the Grecians denying ſubiection vnto the See of Rome; which was begun (ſay the Apologiſts) by Iohn Biſhop of Conſtantinople, who was therefore contradicted by Pope Gregory the Great, lib. 4. epiſt. 34.
                  6 This aſſertion concerning the [deniall of ſubiection by the Grecians vnto Rome,] although it be 
                        See confuted aboue lib. 1. cap. 11. &c.
                      falſe, yet will we (for diſputation ſake) ſuppoſe it to be true. The thing that Pope Gregory did condemne in Iohn Patriarch of Conſtantinople, was the 
                        See aboue lib. 1. cap. 2. Sect. 19. 
                     title of vniuerſall Biſhop of the Church. This indeed S. Gregory did contradict, calling it a See ibidem. 
                     title of noueltie, of errour, of impietie, of blaſphemie, and the very poyſon of the Church of Chriſt: which (ſaith he) neuer any of my Predeceſſors conſented to vſe: adding, that whoſoeuer ſhall vſurpe it, is the forerunner of Antichriſt. Notwithſtanding, Pope Boniface (who did ſucceed S. Gregory next except one, did (as hath bene confeſled) aſſume that title of vniuerſall Biſhop; and the Popes, euer after him, haue challenged it as a ſpeciall p
                        •
                     erogatiue of their Popedome.
                  7 Now let theſe great diſputers maike what will be the force of this their owne inſtance. The title of vniuerſall Biſhop, and dominion thereby implied, is, by the iudgement of S. Gregory, no more belonging vnto the Biſhop of Rome, than it did vnto the Greeke Patriarch. We hence make bold to demand, Was this reſiſted in Boniface, the firſt vſurper of it in the Romane Church, or not? If it was reſiſted, then muſt the Apologiſts, by their doctrine, confeſſe it to be an Innouation: if it was not reſiſted, then is it poſſible that an Innouation might paſſe without reſistance.
                  
                  8 Afterwards Luther is produced for an Innouator, becauſe his opinion was contradicted and reſiſted at his firſt riſing. But what was his firſt opinion, and of what kind was his firſt reſiſtance? Firſt of his opinion: Martinus Lutherus noſtro ſeculo ab Indulgentiarum repraehenſione principium fecit ſectae ſuae propagandae, vt perſpicuum eſt ex aſtertionibus articulorum à Leone 10. damnatorū. Bellarm. lib. 1. de Indulg. cap. 1. pag. 7. 
                     Martine Luther (ſaith their Cardinall Bellarmine) did begin his oppoſition vnto Rome in reprehending their article of Indulgences. Concerning his reſiſtance, Leo decimus, anno ſalutis 1517. habuit in Germani
                           •
                         procuratores Indulgentiarum,—quas illi praedicarent valere non ſolùm ad ſalutem viuorū, verumetiam mortuorum animas ſubleuandas, quae in Purgatorio eſſent. Tum praeſtò fuit Lutherus, Auguſtinianus Monachus, homo in Theologia apud ſuam Gentem primatius, qui illud improbarit Procuratores eà revaldè commoti, primo quoque tempore nomē Lutheri Romā ad Magiſtratus deferunt; is continuò vt deorū contemptor accuſatur, citatur, cauſa agitur: ſed quia ad diē dictam non adfuit Romae praeſens vt relponderet, paulò poſt declaratur haereticus. Polyd. Virgil. lib. 8. Invent. cap. 4 pag. 492. purged out by the Romiſh Index.
                      
                     Pope Leo the tenth (ſaith Polydore) ſent his Proctors into Germany, who preached the article of Indulgences, affirming, that they are powerfull both for the good of the liuing, and alſo for the eaſe of ſoules tormented in Purgatory. Luther then roſe vp to diſproue them, and was therefore preſently cited to Rome, and accuſed; and becauſe he did not appeare at the day aſsigned to anſwer to the accuſation made againſt him, he was forthwith pronoūced an hereticke. Here we ſee Luther reſiſting the Pope, and the Pope reſiſting Luther: the matter is the doctrine of Indulgences, which (as hath bene confeſted by the Romaniſts themſelues) 
                        See aboue lib. 1. cap. 2. Sect. 20. And in this booke, cap. 12. Sect. 1. 
                     is not expreſly deliuered either in Scripture, or in the writings of ancient Fathers: nor was in vſe in the primitiue Church: but hath bene termed by their owne Authors a doctrine of godly deceit, and indeed a palpable noueltie. Now then, the caſe is plaine, the Popes reſiſtance doth not proue the Innouation of Luthers doctrine, but the Inuouation of the Popes doctrine doth iuſtifie Luthers reſiſtance.
                  
                  9 Waldo, VVickliffe, and Luther (giue me leaue thus farre to digreſſe) are brought in as though they were authors of three different religions: this is our Aduerſaries guiſe, whenſoeuer they happen vpon the mention of theſe names; whereas (if they ſhall be willing to conferre with their owne Thuanus) they may be otherwiſe directed.

                  10 But who is a mans neighbour? was it the Prieſt or the Leuite, who both paſſed by the man that lay wounded in their way? O no, but the Samaritane, who had compaſſion on the diſtreſſed, and powred oyle and wine into his wounds, to heale him and preſerue him aliue: this man was his neighbour that fell among theeues. Why then ſhould the Apologiſts vpbraid England with the neighbourhood of Rome, whoſe wine is turned into vineger, oyle intogall, bread into powder, and fiſh into a ſerpent, purſuing that Iſland not with praiers of compaſſion, but with fire of perſecution?
                  11 What ſhall induce vs to think that Rome hath not caſt off her firſt faith?

We haue heard, by the confeſſion of her owne Cardinals, Biſhops, and Doctors, that ſhe is manifoldly declined from the primitiue profeſſion, both in doctrine and practiſe of Chriſtianity, concerning matters of no leſſe moment than are the Scriptures, Sacraments, Iuſtification, Prayers, and almoſt the whole frame and gouernment of the Church, and ſincere forme of the worſhip of God?

Popes, their owne paramours, in S. Peters chaire? for who can hold them for true ſucceſſors, who wanted both the election and approbation of the Clergie? Whilest that the ancient Canons and decrees of elder Popes were ſuppreſſed, and the former cuſtomes of election vtterly extinct, then, as it may ſeeme, Chriſt lay in his ſhip (meaning the Church) aſleepe, and it was beaten and toſſed with raging tempeſts, and he diſſembled, as it were, that he ſaw thoſe euils, by permitting them to ſway; yea (which is the worſt) there was not found any one among his Diſciples, who liſted to waken our Lord, all of them being in a ſhorting ſleepe.

Peter, the ſeate of the Biſhop of Biſhops, euen the Popedome it ſelfe, by intruſion of monſters, according vnto the luſt of famous whores. Can the Apologiſts require a more notorious and vgly change in practiſe than this? or in a ſubiect matter of more importance, or more free from open reſistance, when behold, all the Diſciples are ſtarke aſleepe? We leaue their practiſe, and returne vnto the doctrine.
                  15 It is a true ſignification, which one of our Doctors hath deliuered, viz. Tranſubſtantiationē ſubſecuta eſt adoratio, that is: Adoration of this Sacrament did follow vpon the doctrine of Tranſubstantiatiō. Therfore adoration could be but an embryo before the daies of Pope Innocentius the 3, at what time Tranſubſtantiation grew to be of ſo perfect a ſtrength, as firſt then to become a doctrine of
                     
                     faith, as their owne Doctors haue affirmed. This maketh the iudgement of our Hoſpinian (an author often cited by the Apologiſts) to ſeeme more probable, who aſcribeth the beginning of adoration vnto Sacerdos quilibet frequent

Where, by the way, we are to vnderſtand, that euen the ordinance of Pope Vrbane ſeemeth not to haue bene void of reſiſtance, ſeeing that, Qu

                     foraſmuch as (thus their Gloſſe ſpeaketh) the conſtitution of Vrbane was not receiued of all, therefore did Pope Clemens command it to be vniuerſally receiued. Yet one would thinke it ſtrange that it found no more generall and free paſſage in thoſe times, if the doctrine of Indulgences had then poſſeſſed mens Creeds: ſpecially ſeeing that Summam Indulgentiarum, quas Vrbanus quartus, Clemens quiatus, Martinus quintus, & Eugenius 4. ipſis, qui ipſo die feſto interſunt primis & ſecundis Veſperis, vel Miſſae vel Matutino, Iuhanus Ponerius collegit, & aſſurgit ad 16000. dierum Indulgentias.

                     This cuſtome of circumgeſtation of the hoaſt (ſaith he) may be left, with (if it be wiſely laid downe) greater profit vnto the Church, both becauſe it is but a new inuention, as alſo becauſe it ſerueth rather for a pompous oſtentation, than for any godly deuotion; and ſo (as Albertus Cranzius ſaith) is contrarie vnto Chriſt his inſtitution.

And who knoweth not that it is not Baptiſme, but Chriſt in the miniſtration of Baptiſme that is to be muocated, and adored, and worſhipped? Which kind of paralleling of phraſes vſed by ancient Fathers, concerning Baptiſme and the Euchariſt, may be as good as any Comment for our right vnderſtanding of antiquity. Howbeit, that reuerence which belongeth vnto the ſacred things of God, cannot without impiety be denied vnto the holy Sacramēts, becauſe in them we haue ſealed vnto vs that eternall & ſauing truth, which is promiſed in the word, where of Tertullian ſaid, Adoro plenitudinem Scripturarum.

                     ALL this their Surpluſſage, or further demonſtration (as they call it) is nothing elſe but indeed a ſuperfluity, being onely (as will appeare,) a new moulding of that maſſe and lumpe of matter which they had formerly collected: therefore may we referre our anſwer with no leſſe caſe than they haue done their proofes, vnto This they do generally in

Ergo, this their reſumption of the continuance of the now profeſsion of the Romane faith for the first 600 yeares, is a meere precipitation.

                        M. D. Rainolds in his conference with M.

                           Cum extra controuerſiam eſſet, nihil à principio vſque ad illam aetatem mutatum fuiſſe in doctrina, ſumebant quod omnibus nouis erroribus conficiendis ſufficeret, illos oppugnare doctrinam ab ipſis vſque Apoſtolis conſtanter & vnammi aſſenſu retentam. Caluin vbi ſupra, l. 4. cap. 2. ſect. 3. Conſidering it was a matter out of all doubt that from the beginning euen vntill that time, nothing was changed in doctrine, the (fore-ſaid) holy Doctors tooke in argument that which was ſufficient for the ouerthrowing of all new errors, (to wit) that they (viz. the heretickes) oppugned the Doctrine which euen from the very Apoſtles themſelues had bene inuiolably and with one conſent reteined: And in his booke of Inſtitutions ſet forth in French, he ſaith expreſly, that 
                        Caluin in his Inſtitutions in French, printed at Geneua by Conradus Badius, Anno 1562. ſaith, C'eſtoyt vne choſe notoire & ſans doubte, que depuis L'aage des Apoſtres, iuſques à leur temps, il ne c'eſto

                         It was a thing notorious and without doubt, that after the Apoſtles age vntill thoſe (fore-ſaid) times, no change was made in doctrine, neither at Rome nor at other Cities: So plainely do our learned aduerſaries acknowledge, that no change of faith was made by the Romane Church from the Apoſtles age vntill the times of Saint Auſtine, Epiphanius, Optatus, &c. Which was for ſoure hundreth and fortie yeares after Chriſt.

                  SECT. 3.
                  4 This generall conſent of our ſo profoundly iudicious Proteſtants, in appealing vnto the primitiue Church for the ſpace of the firſt foure hundred and fortie yeares after Chriſt, thus acknowledged by our Aduerſaries, may wel ſerue for a iuſt reproofe of their ſlander, who vſually vpbraide Proteſtants with contempt of all Antiquitie: for here euen old Rome is commended by Proteſtants, and produced for the condemnation of this new Rome; which is new, more by alteration of her profeſſion and cuſtomes, than of her edificies and ſituation. Yet gladly would we know what this their Arithmeticall computation may meane.
                  
                     THE ROMISH APOLOGIE.
                     
                        The Church of Rome being then thus cleared from all change of doctrine (at the least concerning any needfull article of faith, which is the onely point now pertinent and queſtionable) during aſwell the firſt 440 yeares after Chriſt, as alſo the other thouſand yeares now laſt paſt: there remaineth onely to be examined, the interim of thoſe 160 yeares which paſſed betweene the ſaid firſt 440. and the ſaid other laſt 1000 yeares; in which meane time, if no ſuch ſuppoſed change was, then doth it hereof vnauoidably follow, that as the Church of Rome at firſt receiued and profeſſed the right faith, ſo likewiſe ſhe doth yet ſtill to this day continue and preſerue the ſame.
                     
                     
                        The matter being as then (euen from the teſtimonies of our learned aduerſaries) made thus iſſuable, and plainly deduced to this certainty or narrow compaſſe of time: we haue here often prouoked them to giue example or inſtance of this their ſuppoſed change in the Romane Church during the ſaid meane time of 160 yeares.
                     
                  
               
               
                  THE PROTESTANTS APPEALE: Shewing the Apologists ſingular curioſitie in the weauing vp of their former ends.
                  
                  SECT. 4.
                  5 A Philoſopher did call ſophiſtrie, (which is an vnſound, but wittie ſubteltie) a ſpiders web, fine, but thin, wouen curiouſly, but eaſily broken: and ſuch like may this workemanſhip of the Apologiſts ſeeme to be, whileſt that they hemme Proteſtants within ſo narrow a compaſſe, as is the interim of an hundred and ſixtie yeares, charging them to proue therein all the Innouations which they haue obiected againſt the Romiſh Church.
                  6 For firſt, Proteſtants, in oppugning doctrines which they call new, and not Catholicke, (that is, not vniuerſally receiued as neceſſarie points of faith,) are ſo farre from ſuffering the limitation of the firſt 440 yeares, that they giue the Romaniſts the ſcope of the firſt 500 or 600 years, as our Aduerſaries themſelues do acknowledge: for D. Stapleton writing of the opinion

of Luther, Caluine, and Melancthon, ſaith, that Quare Luthe

Maiſter Campian a Ieſuite, reporting the challenge of Biſhop Iewell for the maintenance of thoſe articles, which he then propounded for Catholicke, ſaith, that he appealed vnto the iudgement of Antiquitie for the firſt Iohannes Iuellus, Anteſignanus Caluimanorum, Angliae Catholicos, ad D.

And ſo indeed the meaning muſt be, to wit, that the doctrines controuerted were not held in the prefined time of Antiquitie, as now they are in the Church of Rome: as our former diſcourſe hath proued, and the ſequele will more fully confirme.
                  7 Secondly, their paſſage from the daies of S. Gregory (who liued within the firſt 600 yeares) vnto theſe preſent times, (which is the period of a thouſand yeares following) for the vnuiolable continuance of their now Romiſh faith, is praecipitare, non deſcendere; an iſſue void of conſent, and a reckoning (as we ſay) without their hoaſt, as both by the examination of the In the firſt booke. iudgement of S. Gregory, and of the former Throughout the ſecond booke. Antiquitie, hath bin demonſtrated: yet, as though the poore remainders of the 160 yeares, coming betweene Gregory and the former Antiquitie, were the parentheſis, wherein our proofe of their alterations muſt neceſſarily be included, they proceed to play vpon this ſtring ſaying:

                  8 Herein is a commixture and confuſion of caſes, which ought to haue bene diſtinguiſhed, concerning both the ſubiect and the obiect of controuerſies. The ſubiect of Antiquitie is the Church: which is ſometime taken for the vniuerſall companie of profeſſors, ſometime for one or other particular Church of ancient times; and we know that diuerſe particular Churches (otherwiſe orthodoxall) haue had their blemiſhes, which ought not to be imputed vnto the Church vniuerſall.

                        ans, Eutychians, Neſtorians, and ſuch like) from the errors which were not abſolutely fundamentall, but may conſiſt with a poſſibilitie of grace, ſo long as they are not poſſeſſed with a wilfull contradiction againſt the knowne light of the truth.
                  10 Againe, ſome errors are propounded onely as probable opinions, ſome as neceſſary poſitions and concluſions. In the firſt, the Church wherein they are, giueth a libertie vnto men to diſſent, and conſequently a ſecuritie to remaine in ſuch a Church: the other bindeth and conſtraineth a beliefe, and may not be allowed againſt a mans conſcience.
                  11 Laſtly, ſome points were then newly inuented by ſome particular men, which ought to be diſcerned from other doctrines, which were generally profeſſed of almoſt all. By theſe ſo reaſonable and requiſite conſiderations our Authors alledged by the Apologiſts, haue bene freed from detractions, and the now religion of Romaniſts confuted in the aboue ſpecified articles, concerning Scriptures, Sacraments, priuate Maſſe, Free-will, Merit, Iuſtification, manner of Worſhip, and (beſides many others) in Popedome it ſelfe.
                  12 To conclude, ſeeing there is ſcarce any one point in controuerſie betweene vs and Rome at this day, which we are not able to proue to be orthodoxall and true, by the expreſſe teſtimonies of diuerſe Romaniſts of principall eſteeme in their Church, both before and ſince the coming of M. Luther, as, throughout the particular Treatiſes in this Appeale, hath bene amply confirmed, we thinke that this their importunate ſeeking of a note of reſistance muſt not a little derogate either from the Apologiſts learning, or modeſtie: for why ſhould they exact notes of oppoſition by Proteſtants vnto

their doctrines, which they may find vſuall in the worthieſt profeſſors of their owne Church. One point yet more.

A common or publike faſt (ſaith Caluine) ioyned with praiers, is behooffull for the Church, whereunto the Paſtor is to exhort, whenſoeuer there is any ſpeciall cauſe to offer ſupplication vnto God; as for example, in danger of ſome great calamitie: becauſe hereby our praiers may become more feruent, our ſoules more humbled, and the wrath of God more eaſily pacified. We haue heard of the doctrine of Luther, who allowed 
                        See aboue lib. 2. cap. 24. ſect 7.

In briefe, their owne Caſſander reporteth the Proteſtants generall opinion in their Confeſsion in Saxonie,

                     wherein they publikely ſhewed their willingneſſe to obſerue the ſet-faſts, and other ſuch like Traditions, yet ſo, as not to place any opinion of merit in ſuch obſeruances, nor obſcure thereby the doctrine of our free iuſtification by faith in Chriſt Ieſus. Which is acknowledged by their Ieſuite Philippus Melancthon non negat ieiunij, & rerum indifferentium obſeruationem poſſe homini prodeſſe, & conducere ad cultum Dei, non tamen inquit immediatè, ſed mediatè: facit enim ieiunium vt homo ſit aptior ad fundendas preces, in quibus eſt cultus Dei. Tererius Ieſ. comm. in Rom. cap. 14. diſp. 3. num. 20. Pererius to haue bene alſo the doctrine of Melancthon.
                  5 Now then, faſts are either priuate, or publike: but our queſtion is of the publike; which are either Eccleſiaſticall, or politicke: but the obiection intendeth onely the Eccleſiaſticall. Theſe are appointed either vpon extraordinarie occaſions, (as in the caſe of common danger and extremitie,) or vpon ordinary courſe. If therfore the Aerians thought only that the Church might diſanull the ſet fasts, or preferre the occaſionall faſts before them, herein they could not be called hereticks; becauſe both many ſuch like Traditions (which were in our Aduerſaries iudgement Apoſtolical,) haue bene 
                        See aboue, lib. 2. cap. 25 ſect. 10. aboliſhed by the Romaniſts themſelues: and alſo the example of the Church of God vnder the law, hath commended vnto vs the excellency of the fasts which are occaſionally appointed. * See aboue, lib. 2. cap. 24. ſect. 5. 6.
                  
                  
                     
6 But if the Aërians abhorred (as they did) ſuch circular ſet-faſts, ſo, as to thinke the appointment of them hereticall, and their vſe impious, taking occaſion thereby to make a ſchiſme in the Church: then Proteſtants (as hath bene proued) are no more Aërians, in condemning the neceſſarie vſe of ſuch faſts, than the Romaniſts are Proteſtants, in auoiding their accidental * abuſes: among whom many muſt neceſſarily fall vpon the reprehenſion of their own Ieſuite Pererius: Quartum genus abſtinentiae hodiè colunt multi peruersâ ratione,—quippè vel errore opinionis exiſtimant ſummam perfectionis Chriſtianae in vnius abſtinentiae cultu, & exercitatione continen, vel hominum laudem aucupantur,—vt incautis & ſimplicibus falſa ſua dogmata perſuadeant: vel denique cùm deficiat illos prudentia, ſine modo abſtinentiam tractant, ſcilicet, magno rerum v

                  THE PROTESTANTS APPEALE: In the firſt point, the teſtimonies of their Aduerſaries.
                  
                  SECT. 1.
                  
                     THE Author, in whom this pretended hereſie was rooted, is Vigilantius; the witneſſe from whom the accuſation is deriued, is S. Ierome; the Aduerſaries vpon whom the ſame is faſtened, are the Proteſtants, laſtly, the accuſers by whom it is enforced are the Romaniſts: theſe foure being duly examined will giue vs cauſe to miſlike in the Apologiſts a foure-fold defect.
                  2 For firſt, Vigilantius is not challenged by S. Hierome in any one ſyllable, for the article of our Inuocation of Saints: but onely for ſaying, Dicis in libello tuo, quòd dùm viuimus mutuo pro nobis orare poſſumus; poſ
                           •
                        quam autem mortui fuerimus, nullius ſit pro alio exaudienda oratio: praeſertim cùm Martyres vltionē ſui ſanguinis obſecrantes, impetra
                           •
                        e non quiuerint. Hieron. tom. 2. lib. 2. aduerſus Vigilant. And againe: Si Apoſtoli & Martyres adhuc in corpore conſtituti, poſſunt orare pro caeteris, quandò pro ſe adhuc debēt eſſe ſolliciti, quanto magis poſt coronas, victorias, & triumphos? Ibid. verbis ſeqq.
                      
                     The prayers which the Saints make for the liuing, are not heard of God. This their Cardinall acknowledgeth, who, not finding any mention of Inuocation in S. Hierom his exception againſt Vigilantius, is glad to ſtraine it out by force of Docuit Vigilantius orationes mortuorum pro alijs non exaudiri, ex quo ſequitur eos fruſtrà inuocari. Bellar. lib. 4. de no
                           
                              •
                           is Eccleſ. c. 9. §. 13. Vigilantius. This conſequence doth proue, that Vigilantius thought that Saints were not to be inuocated: but it doth not proue that S. Hierome reprehended him for denying Inuocation; or that S. Hierome himſelfe defended the Inuocation of Saints. 
                     conſequence,
                     
which for lameneſſe is called a flat non ſequitur. This argueth their firſt defect, which is an ignorance of the exception taken againſt Vigilantius.
                  
                  3 Secondly, S. Hierome, to proue that the Saints departed pray for the liuing, doth firſt endeuour to ſhew that they know the ſtate of the liuing: and to manifeſt their knowledge, he affirmeth, that they are conuerſant with men: reaſoning thus: Tu Apoſtolis vincula inijeis, vt vſque ad diē iudicij teneantur cuſtodià, nec ſint cum Domino ſuo, de quibus ſcriptū eſt, Sequuntur agnum quocunque vadit: Si agnus vbique, ergo hi, qui cū agno ſunt, vbique eſſe credendi ſunt: & cùm diabolus & daemones toto vagentur in orbe, & celeritate nimia vbique praeſentes ſunt, &c. Hieron. aduerſ. Vigilant. loco ſuprà citato.
                      
                     If the Lambe (Chriſt Ieſus) be euery-where, they who are ſaid to follow the Lambe whereſoeuer he goeth, are to be thought to be alſo euery-where. But this property of being euery-where, being eſſentiall vnto the diuine nature, Hieronymus aduerſ. Vigilant. dicit, Angelos propter celeritatem naturae, quodammodò eſſe vbique:—Sed ad cognoſcendas preces, quae codem tempore fiunt in diuerſiſſimis locis, non ſufficit celeritas, ſed requiritur vera vbiquitas, quam nec Angelorum, nec hominum ſpiritibus conuenire credimus. Bellar. lib. 1. de beat. Sanct. cap. 20. §. Alij dicunt. Obſerue, that word quodammodo is not in S. Hierome.
                      
                     cannot be incident (as their Cardinall Bellarmine truly teſtifieth) vnto Angels or vnto any created ſpirit. Wherefore the former aſſertion of S.

                      hath confeſſed that they grant, that the Saints do pray for vs, although not in particular (and therfore are not to be inuocated,) yet notwithſtanding in generall, and conſequently are heard of God. See now theſe different cōplexions; Vigilantius ſaid that Saints departed are not heard of God, & that therfore they pray not for the liuing; Proteſtants grant that they pray to God for the liuing in generall, and therfore are heard of God: whence ariſeth a note of their third defect, in not diſcerning the difference betweene Vigilantius and Proteſtants, to be as much as ſaying and gaineſaying.
                  5 Fourthly, the Romaniſts lay for the ground ſole, yea and for the ſole ground of the Inuocation of Saints, this principle, Saints do vnderſtand our prayers: otherwiſe, they would except againſt the direct Inuocation of Saints: wherefore the arch-queſtion is, how the Saints departed do vnderſtand the praiers of the liuing: whether (as our Aduerſaries themſelues conceiue and teach) by hearing, or elſe by ſeeing.
                  
                  6 If by hearing, then is it either directly and immediatly from the parties themſelues, or elſe by the relation of ſome Angels. But Quidam dicunt eos cognoſcere ex relatione Angelorum, qui nunc ad coelos aſcendunt, nunc indè ad nos deſcendunt: quam rationem inijcit B. Auguſtinus. Et,

                     of Angels (ſaith their Cardinall,) although S. Auguſtine do intimate this, becauſe the Angels are not in themſelues capable of the praiers of mens thoughts; 
                     Alij dicunt Sanctorum animas ſicut etiam Angelos, mirà quadam celeritate naturae quodam modo eſſe vbique, & per ſe audire preces ſupplicantium, quam rationem videtur habere B. Hieron. in lib. cōtrà Vigilant. Sed neutra eſt ſufficiens.—Et ad cognoſcē

                     becauſe if the Saints receiued their knowledge by new Reuelations from God, the Church could not ſay ſo boldly vnto them, Pray for vs, before ſhe ſhould pray vnto God to reueale her praiers vnto the Saints: and alſo for that there can no reaſon be giuen, why the Church of the old Teſtament (wherein there were Saints) did not inuocate and call vpon the Saints departed.
                  
                  8 So now the Romaniſts haue impoſed vpon Vigilantius a wrong ſtate of a queſtion, viz. our praying vnto Saints, in ſtead of the Saints praying for vs. Secondly, they violently applie it vnto Proteſtants, who are acknowledged aduerſaries vnto that opinion of Vigilantius. Do they ſtill preſſe the teſtimonie of Hierome for proofe of the Saints praiers for the liuing, and notwithſtanding reiect his authoritie, where he teacheth the manner of the Saints Namely, by their perſonall preſence. See aboue. vnderſtanding of mens prayers made vnto them? Finally whileſt that they endeuoured to ſatisfie how the Saints do vnderſtand our praiers (without which capacitie they may not be inuocated) in propounding onely foure poſſibilities thereof, they themſelues in their ſeuerall anſwers haue diſabled each one, and may therefore be admoniſhed not to contend againſt others, vntill firſt they be reconciled vnto thēſelues. But the articles & ioints of this Inuocatiō we haue handled

                        D. Fulke againſt the Rhemes Teſtament, ſuper. Act. 19. 12. 
                     Vigilantius was not condemned of hereſie by the Church, although S. Hierome
                     
                     did write ſo bitterly against him; who did write alſo againſt S. Auguſtine, and Ruffinus, which yet were counted as good Catholicks as he. As for Vigilantius, neither by Epiphanius, Philaſtrius, Auguſtine, Theodoret, Iſidorus, Damaſcenus, Antiochus, or any other ancient writer, that gathered the Catalogue of hereticks and hereſies that were before their time, is he once touched, or his opinion against the immoderate eſtimation of relicks condemned.
                  
                  10 As for S. Hierome, he hath incurred a cenſure, which requireth in him Vigilantius ſcripſit librum, in quo docebat non eſſe ſic adorandas Martyrum reliquias, nec ad horum ſepulchra vigilandum, quod id temporis magnâ religione fiebat à Chriſtianis. In hunc ita conuitijs debacchatur Hieronymus, vt pluſ culū in eo modeſtiae cogar deſiderare. Vtinā argumentis duntaxat egiſſet, & a conuitijs temperaſſet.

                     honourable tranſlation of the bones of Ioſeph out of Aegypt, and conclude, that therefore this office of tranſlating mens bones is not to be iudged new, and ſuperſtitious. Vainely and ſophiſtically argued; for we queſtion not ſo much about the act of tranſlation, but concerning the end, whereof their Ieſuit Oſſa Ioſephi, quae tulerant filij Iſraël de Aegypto in terram promiſſionis, ſepeliuerunt in Sichem, vt habetur Ioſh. cap. vlt.

Laſtly, by Chriſt his inference, It is impoſsible for a rich man to enter (he ſaith not into an higher manſion in the kingdome) into the kingdome of heauen. All which circumſtances make it more than probable, that the matter of promiſe was eternall life, and bleſſedneſſe it ſelfe, which is the reward of commandements; not onely the degree of glorie, which they call the reward of counſels.
                  10 And why may not this, Go ſell, and giue, and follow me, be held for at leaſt an Euangelicall and temporall commandement? For now when Chriſt ſhewed himſelfe willing to ride vpon this colt of an Aſſe, and to vſe him for a diſciple, it could not but be impietie in the yonker not to ſubmit himſelfe, and all that he had vnto the will of his Lord: neither did S.

is a certaine tribulation, and indeed a gulfe of temptation; then are their begging Friers yet to learne how to ſay the Lords prayer.

                  17 Where our godly Reader will eaſily obſerue the ſlippery ſleight of our Aduerſaries, in exacting for proofe of Romiſh declination, an open Reſiſtance; and if it happen that no Reſiſtance can be ſhewne againſt their nouelties, then are Proteſtants, for want of ſuch proofe, condemned for heretiks: and if a reſiſtance be diſcouered, then they forthwith are called heretikes, who did reſiſt. This is more then partialitie. In the laſt place is to be vnfolded

                  18 Their firſt degree of Monaſticall pouertie is that which is profeſſed in hauing the vſe of things in common: whereupon ariſeth a queſtion, whether the ſtate of Biſhops, who poſſeſſe lands and goods, and enioy the proprietie of them, or rather of Monks, who depriue themſelues hereof, be more perfect? Whereof our Aduerſaries haue thus determined: Tertius gradus eſt diligere Deum,—quā

                     The ſtate of Biſhops (ſay they) is the more perfect, becauſe in it perfection is alreadie atchieued; and the ſtate of the religious Monks is leſſe perfect, becauſe they are but contending vnto perfection. Thus whileſt they haue defined perfection to conſiſt in voluntarie pouertie, which is an

                     alienation of all proprietie of worldly goods, and yet do preferre the ſtate of Biſhops, poſſeſſing wealth (and ſome alſo poſſeſſed thereof,) they doe but, in effect, contend to place perfection in no perfection.
                  
                  
                     
19 Secondly, Imprimis Gregorius nonus, anno Dom. 1238 Conſtitutionem edidit, quâ omnibus Eccleſiarum Praefectis praecepit, vt Mendicantes rem diuinam facere, conciones habere, ac ſacras peccatorum confeſſ ones audire, liberè permittant:—Eandemue Conſtitutionem innouanit Innocent 4. anno 1245. qui tamen poſteà prohibuit ab his omnibus Miniſterijs Mendicantes. Azor. Ieſ. Inſtit. Moral. part. 1. lib. 13. cap. 2. initio.
                      
                     Pope Gregory the ninth (anno 1238.) did first ordaine the begging Monks to preach, and adminiſter the Sacraments; which was afterwards confirmed (anno 1243.) by Pope Innocentius the fourth: who himſelfe, not long after, did forbid them to exerciſe any ſuch functions. Yet the reaſon whereby the leſuite doth excuſe the Mendicants for not labouring, is, Septimò quaeritur, cur Mendicantes, viribus alioqui praediti, manibus minimè laborent, cùm ex Auguſtino per totum librum de opere Monachorum, ex Baſilij, item & Benedicti regula, & cap.

                        , olim Monachos manibus laborare conſucuiſſe? Reſpondeo, cum S. Thoma Opuſc. 19. cap. 5. Non idem iuris eſſe de Mendicantibus, quod de Monachis: illi enim ſunt inſtituti ad docendum, concionandum, conferendum Sacramenta, & proindè ad diligentem literis operam nauandam. Azor. Ieſ. ibid. cap. 1. §. Septimò quaeritur. 
                     becauſe (ſaith he) they are appointed to preach. Neuertheleſſe, Ignatius Loyola prouided for the Order of his ſociety of Ieſuits 
                        See confeſſed aboue, lib. 1. cap. 2. Sect. 38. 
                     ſufficient of victuals, euen becauſe learning is not attained vnto in extreme beggery.
                  
                  20 So now the reaſon why their Mendicants worke not, but begge, is becauſe they vſe to preach: contradictorily, the reaſon why the Ieſuits are prouided for, that they beg not, is becauſe they are ordained to preach. But if begging be an hinderance vnto preaching, why do the Mendicants begge? If voluntarie begge
                        •
                     y be no hinderance vnto that function, but euen a furtherance vnto perfection, why do not the Ieſuites begge? Finally, in their not begging Orders, which haue ſo great plentie, we find, as yet, no perfection of pouertie; and in their begging ſect (being vnlawfull) no pouertie of perfection.
                  21 Onely the point of merit remaineth, which their De ſecunda quaeſtione Nicholaus 4. qui in cap. Exijt, de verborum ſignif. in ſexto, ſentit illam paupertatem eſſe ſanctam, & meritoriam, negat Iohannes. Et quanquam melius Nicholaus ſentit, tamen nec Nicholaus hoc definiuit, tanquam a

                     Pope Nicholas the fourth (anno 1288.) defended to be in voluntarie pouertie, but Pope Iohn the 22. (anno 1410.) denied it: and now the Romaniſts (as though the latter Pope were not the wiſer) do chooſe in this point to be (that we may ſo ſpeake) Nicolaitans.
                  22 Wherefore (that we may conclude, not from any Authors paſſion, but from our Aduerſaries teſtimonies and poſitions:) There is a neceſſarie relinquiſhment of all, or of ſome wealth, belonging vnto all Chriſtians, in the habituall preparation of the heart alwaies, & in actuall effect, whenſoeuer riches and Chriſt, ſence and faith, God and Mammon ſtriue for maſterdome: 
                        Mat. 6. 24. 
                     No man can ſerue two maſters. But this renunciation is not vpon counſell onely, but vpon commandement, euen that which we haue learned as the A B C of our Chriſtianitie, 
                        Mat. 19. 29. 
                     Leaue father &c. and 
                        Mat. 16. 24. 
                     take vp the croſſe, and follow me; whether the commandement be temporall and perſonall, as vnto Abraham, to leaue his fathers houſe; or perpetuall and generall, to leaue Babylon, and whatſoeuer hindereth from ſaluation.
                  23 In the matter of counſell, for a mans more expedite courſe in Chriſtianitie, it is free vnto him to leſſen his burthen, and to change property for communitie, but not for a profeſſion of beggerie: yet ſo eſteeming of lawfull actions as works of perfection, by comparing himſelfe with himſelfe, not with others, who, as the true ſeede of Abraham, may be more perfect in vſing their poſſeſſions, than he in renouncing them. 3. To relinquiſh the opinion of merit, properly takē, becauſe that which in gods indulgēce is matter of coūſel, is, in regard of his ſtrict iuſtice, which ſaith,

                     OVR Aduerſaries haue diuerſly interpreted the hereſie of the Nouatians: their firſt expoſition is, that they taught, that Tertia haereſis omnem poenitentiae virtutem tollit, dicens eos qui ſemel lapſi ſunt, nunquam poſteà conſequi remiſſionem, quantum libet poſteà poeniteant. Huius author fuit Nouatus, &c. Alphonſ. de Caſtro aduer. hereſ. li. 12. Tit. De Poenitentia. §. Tertia haereſis. His whole diſcourſe there is to proue, that he taketh from God power of forgiueneſſe of ſinne in ſuch caſes: and Omne peccatum lethale poſt baptiſmum commiſſum, irremiſſible cenſuerunt.

                     no man committing any mortal ſinne after baptiſme, could poſsibly obtaine pardon at Gods hands, although he became neuer ſo penitent; as their Caſtro, Vega, and Senenſis do conceiue. But Cardinall Bellarmine doth not thinke that they were ſo blinde as to Neque, vt nonnulli falſo exiſtimant, poenitentiae & ſpem veniae à Deo obtinendae haeretici (meaning Nouatians) tollebantè medio. Bellar lib. 1. de Paenit. cap. 9. initio.
                      
                     denie all hope of pardon from God: neither will he ſeeme to be ſo malicious, as to impute this errour vnto Proteſtants.
                  2 A ſecond vnderſtanding of this Nouatian hereſie their Cardinall Baronius deliuereth, to be Cyprianus pluribus docet, Nouatianum eius fuiſſe ſententiae, vt negaret ſemel lapſos ampliùs in Eccleſiam eſſe admittendos, ſed eſſe Dei iudicio relinquendos, nec vllum lapſorum habendum eſſe diſe imen, criminumvè diſtincti

Maldonat. Ieſ. comment. in Ioh. 5. 14. Maldonate confirmeth out of Pacianus; and addeth, that this ſame Abutebantur hoc loco Matth 9. 6. Nouatiani, vt probarent, non poſſe Sacerdotes remittere peccata: quemadmodum hodiè corum haeredes Caluiniani in cundem errorem abutuntur. Idem comment. in Matth. cap. 9. verſ. 6. col. 225. 
                     hereſie is hereditarie in the Caluiniſts: which the Apologiſts do likewiſe inſinuate.

                     three points. Firſt, that euery one, as long as he lodgeth in this mortall bodie, hath need of remiſsion of ſinne. Secondly, This remiſsion muſt be had in the Church. Thirdly, It is performed by the power of the keyes, which Chriſt hath giuen vnto euerie faithfull congregation. And although Caluine had bene ſilent, yet is God able out of hearts as hard towards him as ſtones, to raiſe vp witneſſes in his behalfe: for behold, his greateſt Aduerſarie (Cardinall Bellarmine) teſtifieth, that Hanc antiquiſſimā Haereſin iam olim damnatam iterum excitare conatus eſt Lutherus & qui poſt eū ſurrexerunt falſi Prophetae Zuinglius, Caluinus, & caeteri.

Bellar. lib. 1 de Poenit cap. 9. §. Hanc. 
                     Luther, Zuinglius, Caluine, and others do acknowledge a certaine reconciliation of ſinnes after Baptiſme: 
                     Non probant (Proteſtantes) quòd ijdem (Nouatiam) eos, qui poenitentiam agerent, nolebant abſoluere, & ad communionem admittere. Coccius Theſaur. Cath. Tom. 1. lib. 8. art. 3.

                  4 Not that the Cardinall is leſſe calumnious, but that he meant to be more ſubtle than other accuſers, and therefore intendeth to draw Proteſtants within the compaſſe of the hereſie of the Nouatians by a third manner of interpretation thereof.

                     For although Proteſtants (ſaith he) acknowledge a power of reconciliation towards ſinners, yet do they not account this power of remiſſion of ſinnes to be iudiciall, but onely by way of preaching and declaring that ſinnes are remitted: which he will haue to be the Nouatian hereſie; and which we ſhall proue to be neither the hereſie of the Nouatians, nor yet any hereſie.
                  5 To ſhew that this was not the doctrine of the Nouatians, we dare appeale vnto the iudgement of Cardinall

For the firſt ſort, to make Proteſtants guiltie, ſaid, that the Nouatians denied all power of reconciliation in the Church after Baptiſme: and their Cardinall anſwereth in behalfe of Proteſtants, ſaying, that they do not ſo. Afterwards he accuſeth them onely about the forme of abſolution and reconciliation, which he contendeth to be iudiciall: which (by the iudgement of his collegues) was not the hereſie of the Nouatians: and by the concluſion of his maſter and others, is not an hereſie, but a ſound and orthodoxall truth.

                  2 Caluine himſelfe deſireth to be heard ſpeake: Dicimus ergo naturali hominem vitioſitate corruptum, ſed quae à natura non fluxerit. A natura fluxiſſe negamus. vt ſignificemus aduentitiam magis eſſe qualitatem, quae homini acciderit, quàm ſubſtantialem proprietatem, quae ab initio indita fuerit.—Non etiam ineptè dicetur naturaliter prauus & vitioſus: quemadmodum non veretur Auguſtinus, ratione corruptae naturae, naturalia dicere peccata, quae in carne noſtra neceſſariò regnant, vbi abeſt Dei gratia. Ita euaneſcat ſtultum Manichaeorum nugamentum, qui cùm ſubſtantialem in homine malitiam imaginarentur, alterum illi conditorem affingere auſi ſunt, ne iuſto Deo viderentur mali cauſam & principium aſſignare. Caluinus Inſtit. l. 2. c. 1. §. 11. 
                     We ſay (ſaith he) that the vicious corruption which is in man, came not from nature; away with the foolery of the Manichees, who imagine that there was a ſubſtantiall wickedneſſe in mans nature. Now call in againe both his accuſers, and ſee if they do not effectually diſcharge him: the firſt, Caluinus concedit primum hominem, ante lapſum, libero arbitrio praeditum fuiſſe:—ſed nunc co carere.

                     Caluine (ſaith he) confeſſeth, that man had free-will before his fall. Now liſten vnto the ſecond accuſer, 
                        See the teſtimonie of Maldonate aboue, at the letter, d. 
                     The Manichees tooke away the wils freedome, as well in reſpect of good as of euill: but the Caluiniſts (ſaith he) denie that man (namely after the fall) hath freedome vnto good, but grant it to be free vnto euill.
                  
                  3 Well then, by the firſt it appeareth that the Manichees denied free-will in mans perfect and created nature, and that Proteſtants denie the freedome of will onely in reſpect of mans nature tainted and corrupted: by the ſecond we vnderſtand that the Manichees held mans will euen after his fall, to be free neither vnto good nor euill, and that Proteſtants teach mans will after the firſt ſinne, to be free vnto euill, but not vnto good. So that the Manichees and Proteſtants are at no leſſe differēce in the point of free-will, then there is betweene man ſtanding, and man fallen, betweene nature create & corrupt, betweene good and euill. This will not be thought ſufficient, except we further ſhew,
               
               
                  
                  That Proteſtants doctrine, concerning Free-will, is the more truly Catholicke.

                  SECT. 3.
                  5 Who do accuſe the Proteſtants herein? Euen the Romiſh Apologiſts, and that very vrgently: See aboue in their obiection. 
                     Sundrie heretickes (ſay they) denied ſundrie points of our now Catholicke faith, and among other points, is the denying with the Manichees, that grace is conferred in Baptiſme. Thus are Proteſtants accuſed: who ſhal abſolue thē? Euen the ſame Apologiſts, by the very ſame teſtimonie, wherby they intend to proue Proteſtāts to be guiltie of this hereſie of the Manichees.
                  6 The teſtimonie lurketh in the margent, masked in Latine: we ſhall neede but onely to draw it into view, by tranſlating it. Concerning the other point touching Baptiſme, Maſter Whitaker (ſay they) confeſſeth the ſame, ſaying: What? viz. We (ſaith Doctor Whitaker, ſpeaking of Proteſtants) teach, that ſinnes are forgiuen in Baptiſme, and grace therein conferred, which doctrine the Manichees are wont to denie: therefore are we farre from the opinion of the Manichees. Whereunto aſſenteth their other obiected Author Sarcerius, noting it among the ancient errours, to ſay, that

                     Baptiſme is onely a ſigne, or onely an outward waſhing of the bodie, or that it taketh not away the guilt of originall ſinne. Againe, the power of conferring grace in Baptiſme, hath bene See aboue. confeſſed by our Aduerſaries to be the generall doctrine of Proteſtants.
                  7 The ſumme of this accuſatiō is, that the Proteſtants are Manichaean heretiks, who are the known Aduerſaries vnto the Manichees. What ingenuous minde would not congratulate the Proteſtants happineſſe, to ſee them thus acquitted not onely by their oppoſite accuſers, but euen by the accuſation it ſelfe? and iudge that ſuch accuſers do beſt deſerue the name of Manichaei à quodam Perſa extiterunt, qui vocabatur Manes, (Madm

                  THE PROTESTANTS APPEALE: Freeing themſelues from the note of Pelagianiſme.
                  
                  SECT. 1.
                  
                     THis deniall of the neceſsitie of childrens Baptiſme, is now the ſecond time obiected againſt Proteſtants: but then in the name of an errour, now vnder the title of an ancient hereſie, iſſuing from ſuch Authors, whom they thēſelues (becauſe of 
                        See aboue lib. 2 cap. 10. Sect. 11. ſome alliance they haue with them) ſhould doubt to call hereticks. But to the point: We ſay that our Aduerſaries in this one obiection are thrice indiſcreet.
                  2 Firſt, by not conſidering that the ſame ſentence may be both hereticall and orthodoxall, according vnto the different intention of the profeſſors thereof, euen as the ſalutation of haile Maiſter, offered vnto Chriſt the ſonne of God, by deuout worſhippers, was a due honour; but being caſt vpon him by the deſpiſers and mockers, was (more bitter than the veneger and gall) ranke blaſphemie.
                  3 So in doctrines, Polycrates, and the holy Martyrs of the Greeke Church held the time of Eaſter at the time which was obſerued of the Iewes: which Time alſo Blaſtus the heretike did preciſely keepe: theſe contrarie profeſſors were diſtinguiſhed in one action by the difference of their intentions; for the Blaſtiās held it Iewiſhly, as thinking the Leuitical law neceſſary; but the Martyrs kept the ſame time of Eaſter Chriſtianly in an opinion of indifferencie, vntil at length that time of obſeruatiō was changed, to the end that the Iewiſh & Chriſtian profeſſors might be better diſtinguiſhed. Many hundred like examples might be produced, of Catholike ſpeeches and cuſtomes which haue bene heretically profeſſed, and gaue the Fathers occaſion to call the Diuell, Gods Ape: becauſe he ſo ſorteth his hereſies, that they may carie in them an imitation of truth.
                  4 So alſo euen in our Aduerſaries themſelues, who forbid the eating of certaine meats, as the heretical Tatianiſts and Manichiſts anciently had done, but with a difference: for 
                        The Rhemiſts in their Annot. vpon 1. Tim. 4. 3. 
                     the foreſaid heretikes taught, that men might not eate certaine ſorts of meats, becauſe they thought they were not made of the good God, but of the euill: for the which cauſe they were condemned in Councels. But abſtinence from certaine meats is appointed in our Church (ſay the Rhemiſts) for chaſtiſing the bodie with penance. Hereby according vnto vs, that it is not alwaies

                     quid, but quo; that is, not the ſame action, but the diuerſe Principles, and intentions of the action, do diſtinguiſh truth from hereſie.
                  5 So finally it is betweene the Proteſtants and the Pelagians: the Pelagians held a no-neceſſitie in Baptiſme, becauſe they thought that the grace of nature was ſufficiēt for the childrens ſaluation: Proteſtāts hold it not to be of abſolute neceſſity, becauſe of the free power of grace aboue nature: which teacheth, that when there is defect of Baptiſme, without cōtempt, Gods mercy is 
                        See confeſſed aboue, lib. 2. cap. 13. Sect. 6. &c.
                      not tyed vnto the outward elements. Secondly, the Pelagians held childrens Baptiſme not neceſſarie in the Church; Proteſtants teach the neceſſitie of childrens Baptiſme in the Church, and the ſanctifying grace, and power thereof. Thirdly, the Pelagians reaſon is taken from the perfection of nature, the Proteſtants dependeth vpon the Axiomes of grace. Notwithſtanding all theſe maine diſtances, yet haue the Romaniſts not ſpared to ranke Proteſtants thus indiſcreetly with (their moſt oppoſite Aduerſaries) the graceleſſe Pelagians.
                  
                  6 The next ſymptome of indiſcretion proceedeth from the partialitie of their affection, whileſt they inſiſt vpon the teſtimonies of ſome Fathers, for proofe that children cannot be ſaued without Baptiſme: and yet, contrarie to 
                        Onely the iudgement of Origen may be excepted, which we account as none, becauſe it is condemned by the Romaniſts themſelues. See aboue, lib. 2. cap. 13. Sect. 8. all Fathers, hold a Limbus infantum, which they call a peaceable receptacle for all infants dying before Baptiſme. But it is not ſufficient that a man be no heretike, except alſo he be, explicitâ fide, orthodoxall: therefore we furthermore affirme,
               
               
                  That Protestants in the obiected doctrine of Baptiſme, are true Catholicks.
                  SECT. 2.
                  7 A third note of indiſcretion ariſeth from their want of charitie, whil
                        •
                     ſt in their zeale to reach Proteſtants a blow, they do not care whom they hit, whether ancient Fathers (who contrarie vnto the doctrine of abſolute neceſsitie, did

                        Ibidem, Sect. 7. reaſons inexpugnable, taken from the analogie of Circumciſion, from the compariſon of ot her confeſſed powerfull Baptiſmes of Sanguinis and Flaminis, and (which ſurpaſſeth all the reſt) from the equanimitie of Gods mercie. We forbeare to retort the grand hereſie of the Pelagians vpon our Aduerſaries, vntill Proteſtants haue diſcharged themſelues. Therefore do we proceed.

                     Anthropomorphitae were ſo called, becauſe they miſconceiued, that God hath a bodily ſhape like a man; 
                     Haec ergo Anthropomorphitarum ſententia, apert▪ haereſeos conuincitur. Idem ibid. See S. Auguſtine, Tom. 6. haereſ. 50. 
                     which (ſaith their Alphonſus) is a manifeſt hereſie, as See the ſame author. Scriptures and Fathers, and alſo all learned 
                        See aboue lib. 4. cap. 27. Romaniſts do acknowledge.
                  4 But whoſoeuer ſhall ſaile in the Ocean of that See of Rome, and behold their people, who are allowed to pray before the image of an old man, as before the picture of God the Father; and ſhall aske them whether they are

not perſwaded that God is a good man, and hath the proportion and ſhape of a man: he ſhall eaſily finde how their Romiſh imagerie hath turned their people into images, void of true ſence, and vnderſtanding of God.
                  5 Yet (not to do them the wrong, as not to ſhew the chiefe reaſon they haue for picturing God in the likeneſſe of a man) thus their Cardinall doth conclude: Homo eſt vera imago Dei, ſed hominis poteſt pingi imago ergo & Dei: nam quae eſt imago imaginis, eſt etiam exemplaris.—Licet homo ſit ad imaginem Dei, ratione intellectus, & voluntatis, tamen ipſe totus homo intelligens & volens rectè dicitur, & eſt imago Dei: nam Gen. 1. non ait Deus, faciamus animam, ſed faciamus homin
                           •
                         ad imaginem Dei.—Si autē ipſe totus homo eſt imago Dei, & totus homo verè pingitur, ergo imago Dei verè pingitur. Bellar. lib. 2. de Imag. Sanct. cap. 8. §. Quintò &c. 
                     Man is the image of God, but man may be pictured; Ergo, the image of God may be pictured. And when Proteſtants anſwer, that Man is not the image of God, but in the faculties of his ſoule, which cannot be pictured: Ergo, the image of God cānot be pictured: he replieth; Although man be the image of God, in reſpect of his reaſon and will, yet whole man being intelligent is rightly called the image of God; ſo that if the whole man can be pictured, then the image of God may be pictured.
                  
                  6 Which kind of argument no learned man could ſuggeſt, without a reſolued purpoſe to ſophiſticate. Which his fallacie (à figura dictionis) is eaſily diſcouered by the like, thus: Although man be compared vnto a beaſt, in reſpect of his ſenſible and bodily part, yet the whole man being immortall & ſenſible, is rightly compared vnto a beaſt: ſo that if the whole man be immortall, a beaſt may be likewiſe called immortall. And who knoweth not that although the whole man may be ſaid (Synechdochically) to be pictured, yet is not man called the image of God in his whole, but in a part, which is, his reaſonable and inuiſible ſoule, which cannot be pictured.
                  7 Therefore S. Cyrill condemned the Dicebant, cùm Scriptura ait, hominem factum eſſe iuxta imaginem Dei▪ credendum eſſe Deum humanâ formâ praeditum eſſe; quod omninò ſtultum eſt, & extremae impietatis:—Deus enim ſpiritus eſt.—Homo iuxta ſimilitudinem Dei, quatenus rationis particeps, & amans veritatis. Cyril. Alex. Tom. 2. aduerſ. Anthropomorph. in praef.
                      
                     Anthropomorphites of impious folly, for imagining God to haue the figure of a man, becauſe it is written, God made man after his owne image: for by the image here ſignified (ſaith S. Cyrill) is meant mans reaſon and vertue: and, Caſſianus collat. 10. de Anthropomorphitarum haereſi diſſerens, ait huius haereſis patronos ideò aſſerere Deum eſſe corporeum, quià Scriptura dicit, hominem eſſe ad Dei imaginem factum.—Haec facilè, meâ ſententiâ, proſternitur: nam ſi Deus corporeus non eſt, neque membra habet, vt homo: fieri non poteſt, vt homo, ſecundùm corpus, Dei imago dicatur. Alphonſus de Caſtro contra haereſ. l. 8. Tit. Imago. haereſ. 2. fol. 184. 
                     it cannot poſsibly be (ſaith their owne Caſtro) that man in reſpect of his bodie ſhould be called the image of God, 
                     Ex quibus colligimus haec omnia cùm agit, ab anima vires ſuas ſumere: cùm ergo ſola anima habeat intellectum, memoriam & voluntatem, conſequens eſt, vt ſecundum ſolam etiam animam Dei imaginem homo portet.—Potuiſſem pro hac re plura Sanctorum teſtimonia coaceruare, verùm nolui in re manifeſtiſſima nimia prolixitate grauare lectorem.

                     but only in reſpect of his ſoule: Which he granteth might be proued by heaps of teſtimonies frō Antiquity: Therfore ought their Cardinall haue rather leaned vnto the right hand of the anciēt practiſe of the primitiue Church, which neuer pictured God, thā to incline ſo much vnto the left hand, & thus by ſophiſtry to foſter the groſſe hereſy of the Anthropomorphites among their people.

                  THE PROTESTANTS APPEALE.
                  SECT. 1.
                  
                     THE doctrine of Mariage cometh againe in this Scene in the perſons of Vigilantius and Iouinian, which are two noted by. S. Hierome, and applied againſt Protestants by the art of Romaniſts. All theſe Actors require their due and diſtinct obſeruations.
                  2 Firſt, Vigilantius and Iouinian are condemned by S. Hierome, againſt whoſe iudgemēt in this caſe, an Author excepted, ſaying, that In Indice Frobenij: Hieronymus in matrimonium contumelioſus. Deleatur. Index Expurg. apud Iunium, pag. 24. 
                     Ierome ſpake too baſely & contumeliouſly of Mariage: which taxation the Romiſh Cenſuriſts haue commanded to be blotted out; as though this exception againſt Hierome were either a truth ignorantly, or a falſhood malitiouſly deliuered; or elſe, whether it be true or falſe, becauſe a Proteſtant hath ſpoken it, therefore muſt it be blotted out. Wherefore we preſent them with the teſtimonies of their owne Authors, among whom their Ieſuite Salmeron ſaith, Etſi quidam inter veteres Patres caſtitatis & continentiae ſtudioſi, paulò iniquiores & acerbiores in ſecundum co
                           •
                        iugium extiterint, vt Terrullianus & Hieronymus; qui etſi veritatem apertè profiteatur & teneat, vbi tamen locus occurrit dehortandi ab hoc matrimonio, acrior eſt atque feruentior. Salmeron Ieſ Tom. 14. in 1. Cor. 7. diſp. 14. §. Ad dubium. 
                     Hierome was too bitter and hote in dehorting from ſecond mariages. Their Biſhop Eſpencaeus further addeth, that Hierome ſeemeth to haue bene leſſe equal, euen in the caſe of firſt mariage: concerning which point their Rhenanus noteth, that 
                        See aboue lib. 2. cap. 1. Sect. 3. 
                     Hierome was euill ſpoken of at Rome, yea and that Hieronymus impendiò fauens virginitati, & ob id nuptijs iniquior, quàm Epiſcopi quidam eſſe volebant. Eraſmus Arg. in Hieron. contra Iouin.
                      
                     by Biſhops, ſaith Eraſmus. Yet is S. Hierome brought in for a ſole accuſer of Vigilantius and Iouinian, in a cauſe, wherein he is noted to haue bene vehemently vnequall. Which we ſpeake not in defence of any errour of Iouinian, or Vigilantius: and therefore we adde, c Hieronymus aequus ſanè parùm videtur vel vnis nuptijs. Eſpencaeus lib. 3. de Continent. cap. 11. initio.
                     
                  
               
               
                  
                     That the Proteſtants are iuſtified from the obiected errour of Vigilantius: by the teſtimonies of their Aduerſaries.
                  
                  SECT. 2.
                  3 That which is requiſite in the direct triall of all cauſes, we require may be performed in this; viz. to heare the accuſation firſt; which we may receiue

from the mouth of Cardinall Bellarmine: Vigilantius docuit, Eccleſiaſticos debere eſſe vxoratos.—Eadem omnia nunc docent Sectarij: Lutherus, &c. Bellar. de notis Eccleſ. c. 9. §. 13. Vigilantius. 
                     Vigilantius taught that Eccleſiaſticall perſons ought to be maried: ſo doth Luther (ſaith he) and (ſpeaking of other Proteſtants) all Sectariſts. We now vnderſtand the caſe aright: Vigilantius taught that Eccleſiaſticall perſons ought to be maried; and (as their Ieſuite Coſter ſheweth more plainly out of S. Hierome) 
                     Ex Hieronymo conſtat, Vigilantium haereticum docuiſſe, non eſſe Diaconos ab Epiſcopis ordinandos, niſi prius duxiſſent vxores. Ceſter. Ieſ. Enchirid. cap. 17. pag. 522. 
                     Vigilantius taught that euen Deacons ſhould not be ordained, except they firſt were maried.
                  
                  4 But will now their Cardinall giue faith, that ſo do the Proteſtants, namely, that they thinke it vnlawfull for any one to take Orders, before he be maried? This ſome of our Aduerſaries haue ſometime feined, whom their owne Biſhop Eſpencaeus therefore ſuſpected to haue bene Quid in hac re faciant Germani, Helue

                     ſlanderous. Which beyond all ſuſpition, is proued moſt falſe, by the experience of many Miniſters, which liue vnmaried. Yet becauſe our Sauiour hath ſhewne vs that the beſt conuiction of an Aduerſarie is, ex ore tuo; Proteſtants may in this caſe appeale vnto their accuſer Cardinall Bellarmine for their iuſtification, who diſtinguiſheth of (as he calleth them) Duo ſunt refutandi errores, vnus Graecorū, alter Lutheranorum. Prior error eſt, oportere Clericos, antequam ordines ſacros ſuſcipiant, vxores ducere, quia poſt ſacros ordines ſuſceptos, non licet id facere.—Poſterior error longè grauior eſt; non ſolùm licere ante ordinationem, ſed etiam poſt ordinationem vxorem ducere. Bellar. lib. 1. de Cler. cap. 19. initio.
                      
                     two errors, one of the Greeks, who teach that the Cleargie-men ought to be maried, before they enter into Orders; the ſecond of the Lutherans, who ſay (ſaith he) it is lawfull for them to marie both before, and after ordination.
                  
                  5 Marke now (good Reader) and maruell at the confeſſed difference; the Greeks taught an oportere, that is, that all Eccleſiaſticall perſons ought to marie. Which was the doctrine of Vigilantius, as the teſtimonie of S. Hierome alledged by the Apologiſts, ſheweth: wherein Vigilantius is charged not to haue ſuffered ſo much as Proh nefas, Epiſcopos ſui ſceleris dicitu

                     Deacons to be conſecrated, before that they be ſo manifeſtly maried, that their wiues appeare big-bellied. This oportere their Ieſuite Coſter, from the iudgement of S. Hierome, hath confeſſed to haue bene the doctrine of Vigilantius: which Cardinall Bellarmine alſo acknowledgeth, and yet could obiect vnto Proteſtants nothing but onely a licere, that is, that they hold it to be lawfull. So now Vigilantius holding that it is vnlawfull not to be maried, Proteſtants onely a lawfulneſſe to marie; theſe a may, he a muſt, the one ſide defending onely a libertie of mariage, the other a neceſsitie; could Proteſtants be coached with Vigilantius? O diſputers! Secondly,
               
               
                  
                     Protestants are iustified from the guilt of Iouinianiſme.
                  SECT. 3.
                  6 Luther is the principall one, againſt whom in this point of compariſon of virginitie and wedlocke, the Romaniſts do enforce their troups: the Ieſuite Valentia accuſing him of Iouinianiſme, for Cuius erro

Nam ſi matrimonium quiddam praeſtantius eſt, & Deo gratius, nihil eſt cur ſacrati Miniſtri cauſa ſanctitatis & religionis debeant à coniugio abſtinere. Valent. Ieſ.

                     preferring wedlocke.
                  
                  7 But what did Luther teach? Tertius error (meaning of Iouinian) eſt Martini Lutheri, in Epithal. vbi exponens 1. Cor. 7 quatuor comparationes facit: prima eſt caſtitatis cum matrimonio abſolutè, & ſic fatetur caſtitatem eſſe nobilius donum: 2. caſtitatis cum matrimonio coram Deo, & ſic dicit eſſe aequalia: 3. mulieris coniugatae cum virgine, & ait, Oportet admittamus mulierem coniugatam coram Deo praeſtare virginibus. 4. ſtatus coniugatorum, & Eccleſiaſticorum profitentium coelibatum, ſtatum coniugatorum ex natura ſua diuinum, coeleſtem, & quaſi aurum; ſtatum verò caelibum eſſe ſecularem, terrenum, & quaſi lutum. Similia habet Caluinus l. 4. Inſtit. c. 13. §. 3. viz the 3. and 4. Bellar. quo ſuprà. §. Tertius. 
                     Luther (ſaith their Cardinall) made foure compariſons betweene continency & matrimonie. Firſt, abſolutely in themſelues, and ſo he confeſſeth that continency is the more excellent and noble gift. Secondly, in reſpect of God, and ſo he maketh them equall. Thirdly, in the ſame reſpect he preferreth wedlocke before virginitie. Fourthly, comparing them in their owne nature, he calleth the maried ſtate heauenly, the ſingle ſtate earthly; that gold, and this clay. Theſe compariſons their Cardinall hath deliuered in ſuch obſcuritie, as though Luther had bene altogether 
                        For the firſt compariſon preferreth virginitie before mariage in it owne nature, and the fourth doth preferre mariage: the ſecond, in reſpect of God, maketh them equall: and the fourth doth in the ſame reſpect hold mariage the more excellent.
                      contradictorie vnto himſelf: which ſheweth that the accuſer was more willing to relate his words, than to reueale his meaning, which in his As for his obiected Epithalamium, after much ſearch, it could not be found. other Tracts is very obuious, and any may conceiue how the ſingle life may (in reſpect of mariage) be iuſtly both equalled, preferred, and abaſed.
                  
                  8 Firſt, equalled: for compare both the ſtates in a worthineſſe, which in themſelues they may ſeeme to haue before God, the Apoſtle will decide the point: 
                        Gal. 3. 28. 
                     In Christ, there is neither Iew, nor Grecian, neither bond nor free, neither male nor female, &c. No reſpect of perſons with God; then neither of maried nor vnmaried: for theſe do take place among the outward reſpects, which are equally excellent in Gods eſtimate. And thus is the ſecond compariſon founded vpon a common principle in Diuinity.
                  9 Secondly, preferred, in reſpect of effects, and ends, in which regard it may be that Luther called virginitie the more excellent gift: which may be vnderſtood to be more excellēt in two reſpects; the firſt is, becauſe it hath more Mary, and leſſe Martha in it, and is of it ſelfe more free from temporal cares, & therby more expedite in Chriſtiā offices. In which conſideration the Apoſtle ſaith, Beatior quodſi permanere poteſt ita libera, & in Domino etiam, meâ quidem ſ

                     It is more bleſſed if thou remaine vnmaried. The ſecond is the laſt end, that God proportioning his reward of eternall bleſſedneſſe according vnto mans works, which are the gifts of Gods grace, the more plentifull virginitie is in well doing, the more excellently it ſhall be rewarded in bleſſedneſſe; yet not for it owne worth: for as their Aquinas truly obſerueth, Perfectio vno modo conſideratur per ſe quidem & eſſentialiter, & ſic conſiſtit perfectio Chriſtianae vitae in charitate: altero modo, ſecundariò, & accidentaliter,—& ſic conſiſtit inſtrumentaliter in conſilijs, quia omnia, ſicut & praecepta, ordinantur ad charitatem:—vnde dicit Abbas Moſes; Ieiunia, vigiliae, meditatio Scriptura

                        um, nuditas, & priuatio omnium facultatum, non perfectio ſunt, ſed perfectionis inſtrumenta, quòd non conſiſtit in illis diſciplinae finis, ſed per illa peruenitut ad finem. And a little before: Conſilia ordinantur ad remouendū impedimenta actus charitatis, quae tamen charitati non contrariantur. Aquinas 2, 2. qu. 184. ad 3. 
                     watchings, faſtings, nakedneſſe, & the relinquiſhment of riches, are not perfections in themſelues, (which we apply vnto continēcy,) but only inſtrumēts vnto perfectiō. Neither of theſe reſpects of aduācing virginity aboue mariage can offēd our Aduerſaries.
                  10 Thirdly, abaſed in reſpect of their diſproportionate ſubiects, by a double compariſon, as S. Auguſtine doth: firſt in minore & maiore genere boni; for although the ſtate of continencie is in it owne nature more deſtinate vnto the

accompliſhment of ſome Chriſtian actions, than is the condition of wedlock, yet the perſons continent and maried are not alwaies accordingly diſpoſed: for ſometime it happeneth that (as Clemens Alexandrinus noteth) the coniugal parties do ouermatch the virginal profeſſion in the Qui enim perfectus fuerit, exempla habet Apoſtolos, & reuera vir oſtenditur non in

                     the partie maried being more obediēt, is to be preferred before the continēt who is leſſe obediēt. And thus may Luthers preferring of the maried before the virgine be orthodoxally iuſtified.
                  11 Laſtly, if they be compared in genere contrario, as for example, an inobedient virgine with a wife obedient vnto Gods commandements, in this caſe S. Auguſtine hath reſolued by an elegant Simile: Melius eſt habere Zachaei ſtaturam cum ſanitate, quàm Goliae cum febre. Auguſt. ibid.
                      
                     It is better to haue the little ſtature of Zachaeus with health, than the great & vaſt bodie of Goliah with an ague. In like conſideration when we compare one profeſſing virginity with a bondage of a perpetual vow (who hath not receiued the gift of continencie, & conſequently ſuffering manifold exuſtions & ſcorches of concupiſcence, and ſometime alſo falling into adulterous pollutions) with the maried perſon, who for want of the ſame gift of continency doth enioy Gods holy ordinance of mariage; in this caſe we ſhall, with Luther, abaſe this kind of profeſſed virgine before that kind of maried wife, as much as clay or the vileſt dung vpon the earth, in compariſon of gold, or of the moſt peereleſſe pearle that can be named. This is no other doctrine then that which the ſpirit of God hath proclaimed, ſaying, 1. Cor. 7. 9. 
                     It is better to marrie than to burne: which, without blaſphemie, cannot be called hereſie.

                     do not reiect externall and laborious works of Penance: but require them, as ſignes of mens repentance. Neither indeed, do they profeſſe to admit ſcandalous offenders, before they haue expreſſed their contrition by ſome outward and ſatisfiable tokens of repentance: and can we but ſuppoſe a Time, wherein the laborious works muſt be done?

                  SECT. 2.
                  3 Becauſe the Apologiſts labour to conuince the Audiani, and in them all Proteſtants to be heretikes; (as though euery point which Theodoret doth inſ

                     Theſe (ſaith he) boaſt that they can forgiue ſins: for after that they haue diuided the ſacred bookes from the adulterous, they iudge them (namely the ſacred) to be exceedingly darke and myſticall: and when they haue put one verſe by an other, then they command their Diſciples to paſſe through them, and to conſeſſe what ſinnes they haue committed: ſo they giue them remiſsion of their ſinnes, without preſcribing them any time of penance, according as the lawes of the Church do command.
                  
                  4 Thus farre Theodoret. Now we demand of our Aduerſaries, what point of hereſie they can picke out of theſe particulars? Wil they call the Audiani heretikes for boaſting that they could forgiue ſinnes? or for calling the ſacred bookes (of Scripture, for ſuch it ſeemeth they were) mysticall and exceeding darke? or for commanding euery one to confeſſe their ſinnes? The guiltineſſe of our Aduerſaries in all theſe will not permit them to giue this cenſure: yet are theſe mingled with the article which hath bene obiected. And yet furthermore
               
               
                  The Romaniſts are found partly guiltie of the ſame error, which they haue ſo particularly obiected.
                  SECT. 3.
                  5 The onely errour they will faſten vpon, is their tranſgreſſing the lawes of the Church, preſcribing times of penance: Now our 
                        See aboue lib. 2 cap. 15. §. 4. Aduerſaries haue

confeſſed, that the law of the ancient Church was, first to enioyne penance before they gaue remiſsion of ſinnes, (and this is Gods'methode, firſt, Bring forth the fruits of repentance:) but the now Church of Rome (as our See ibidem. Aduerſaries haue confeſſed) doth firs̄t abſolue, and then enioyne penance. And thus by their ſtrict condemning of the Audiani, they are themſelues become heretikes in ſome other points, and in the obiected Article are but prepoſterous Catholicks.

                  THE PROTESTANTS APPEALE: By freeing themſelues, firſt in the point of Merit, by the testimonies of their Aduerſaries.
                  
                  SECT. 1.
                  
                     
                        MErit is a word amphibolon, & of diuerſe ſignifications; ſometime 
                        a See aboue lib. 2 cap. 12. it is taken properly, for opus condignitatis, that is, a worke iuſtly deſeruing the reward of eternall life; ſometime vnproperly, for opus dignationis, that is, a worke rewardable with bleſſedneſſe by Gods gracious acceptance. The Romaniſts preſuming of the perfection of their inherent righteouſneſſe, pleade for Merit in the ſtrict and properſence: but Proteſtants defend Merit onely in the large and improper acception, that is, (as Cardinall Bellarmine teſtifieth,) 
                        See aboue lib. 2. cap. 12. Sect. 4. 
                     they allow the word Merit as it ſignifieth a worke which ſhall be rewarded, ſo that the reward be not attributed vnto the condignity or worthineſſe of the worker, but vnto the bountie of the rewarder.
                  
                  2 And that this doctrine of Proteſtants, concerning the Merit of mans works, is both more ſacred, and more ſafe, our Appeale hath 
                        See aboue lib. 2 cap. 12. alreadie iuſtified: firſt, from the Fathers expoſition of the terme Merit; from their demonſtratiue arguments againſt the pride of mans meriting; and from their diſclaiming of their owne Merits. Secondly, from the ſuffragies of a grand inqueſt of Romiſh Doctors, who of late in their publike writings haue ſealed vp with many proteſtations, the truth and ſecuritie of the ſame profeſſion, of renouncing vtterly the now Romiſh doctrine of Merit. Thus much of the nature of Merit. Secondly,
               
               
                  
                  
                     Proteſtants are no Iouinians in the doctrine of the differences of Merit: proued by the teſtimonies of our Aduerſaries.
                  
                  SECT. 2.
                  3 That which is attributed to Iouinian for an error, is the opinion of the Iouinianus docuit, praemia Beatorum eſſe paria—Bellar de notis Eccleſ. cap. 9. §. 12 Iouinianus. Haereſis ſeptima aſſerit omnes beatos eſſe pares in gloria, neque vllam eſſe in coelis praemiorum differentiā, quoniam nullam eſſe ait in hac vita meritorum diſparitatem. Huius erroris dux & Magiſter Iouinianus. Alphouſus de Caſtro. l. 3. Tit. Beatitudo. haereſ. 7. He neuer nameth Luther, or any Proteſtant.
                      
                     equalitie, both of mens vertues in this life, & of their reward in the kingdome of heauen. Thus of Iouinian: but what of the Proteſtants? Of them the Cardinall writeth thus: Lutherani ex co, quod ſibi perſuadent, iuſtificationis formalem cauſam non eſſe donum aliquod inſuſum à Deo. atque nobis adhaerens, ſed ruſtitiam ſide Chriſti apprehenſam,—Colligunt omnes, non eſſe vnum alio iuſtiorem, cùm omnium iuſtitia ſit ipſa Chriſti iuſtitia, fide apprehenſa. Bellar. lib. 3. de Iuſtif. cap. 1. initio.
                      
                     Becauſe they are perſwaded that the formall cauſe of mans iuſtification is not an infuſed gift, and a iuſtice inherent, but the iuſtice of Chriſt apprehended by faith, they all gather that, Chriſts iuſtice being the ſame vnto all, therefore all are equally iuſt. We aske leaue to manifeſt this egregious ſophiſtication.
                  4 Iuſtice is either inherent in man, which the Scriptu
                        •
                     e ſometime calleth ſanctification, or elſe without him by imputation of Chriſt his righteouſneſſe vnto man, by Caluinus vnam remiſſionem peccatorum, nomine iuſtificationis, intelligit. Vega de Iuſtif. l. 15. c. 5. pag. 680. 
                     remiſsion of ſins. This iuſtice of remiſsion of ſinne by imputation, the Proteſtants indeed, vniuerſally teach to be equall in all men, not that all penitent ſinners are abſolued from equall ſinnes, but that they are equally abſolued from all their ſinnes, namely that no ſinne be left vnpardoned: euen as in debts, where one is a debter in pence, anotherin talents, both being forgiuen, all are equally acquitted, becauſe ſeeing vnto both all are pardoned, there is equally in both iuſt nothing to pay.
                  5 Hereunto the Romaniſts our Aduerſaries will eaſily aſſent (for ſtill ſhall they iuſtifie our doctrine,) their Cardinall teaching from the In Baptiſmo, ex ſententia Scripturae, & ſanctorum Patrum,—plenè & integrè ad omnem poenam & culpam delendam paſtio Chr

                     ſenſe of Scripture (as he ſaith) and iudgement of ancient Fathers, that all that are baptized are abſolutely pardoned, both in reſpect of guilt and puniſhment: (and yet thoſe who were baptized in their full age were not equally ſinners,) yea Impoſſibile eſt per poenitentiam vnum peceatū ſine alio remitti.—Hoc eſſet contra perfectionem miſericordiae Dei, cuius perfecta ſunt omnia, vt dicitur Deut. 32. Cuius miſeretur, totaliter miſeretur: & hoc eſt quod Auguſtinus dicit, in libro de Poenitentia, Quaedam impietas infidelitatis eſt, ab illo qui iuſtus, & iuſtitia eſt, dimidiam veniam ſperare. Aquinas part. 3 qu. 86. ad 3. 
                     it is impoſſibly (ſaith Aquinas) that God ſhould remit one ſinne alone: this were againſt the perfection of his mercy, whoſe works are perfect, as it is written: God doth abſolutely pardon, whom he pardoneth: which occaſioned S. Auguſtine to call it an unpious inſid
                           •
                        litie to expect but an halfe pardon of God, who is iuſtice it ſelfe. The equality of this iuſtification, Scripture, Fathers, Aduerſaries, and common ſenſe it ſelfe teacheth, which is a ſecure and bleſſed hereſie.
                  
                  6 But the other kind of iuſtice, which is called the iuſtice of ſanctification, by mans actuall or habituall righteouſneſſe, this is that which Iouinian vnderſtood, who denied the difference of good works, euen as he did denie the difference of ſinnes, Hic omnia peccata, ſicut Stoici Philoſophi, paria eſſe dicebat. Aug. lib. de hareſ. 82. 
                     ſaying (ſaith S. Auguſtine,) that all ſinnes are equall. Now
               
               
                  
                     Whether Proteſtants be Iouinians, in ſaying all ſinnes are equall, is decided by the iudgement of their Aduerſaries.

And now as we are in expectation, behold their Ieſuite Campian cometh in with vehemencie and confidence, and chargeth Proteſtants, ſaying: Hoc quoque tritum eſt in hac faece, omnia peccata eſſe paria: ſed ita (né Storei reuiuiſcant) ſi Deo iudice ponderentur; ac ſi Deus aequiſſ Index oneri noſtro cumulū potius, qu

Luther is readie to anſwer: Quantumuis inter ſe corporis membra omnia imparia ſint, & officijs atque dignitate plurimum diſtent, in eo tamen paria ſunt, quòd eiuſdem corporis membra exiſtunt, neque poteſt oculus ſibi plus in corpore iuris vindicare, quàm contemptiſſimum quodque, neque plus ſuum corpus eſſe affirmare, quàm cuiuſſ

                     Although (ſaith Luther) the members of the bodie are vnequall, if they be compared together, yet are they in this equall, that they are the members of the ſame bodie: for the eye is no more a member of the body, than the moſt meane and contemptible part, neither hath it any prerogatiue to ſay, I am more a part of the body, than any other. Semblable is the ſtate of Chriſtians, whether it be that ſome are more firme in ſaith, or more perfect
                     
                     in life than others: yet euery one hath as good an intereſt in Chriſt, and Chriſtianity, as another. So that I my ſelfe may glorie in Chriſt, as well as S. Peter, or the bleſſed Virgine, the mother of Chriſt. I do moſt willingly grant, that S. Peter is a more noble member in this (myſticall) bodie of Chriſt, than I am; yet doth not he deſpiſe me, euen becauſe I am a member of the ſame bodie.
                  
                  10 Which compariſon of the diuerſe members of the parts of the body with themſelues, and with the bodie, Luther learned of S. Paul, who ſaith: 1. Cor. 12. ver. 12. according to the Rhemiſh Tranſlation.
                      
                     As the bodie is one, and hath many members, and all the members of the body, whereas they be many, yet are one body, ſo alſo is Chriſt. And verſ. 14: If the foote ſhall ſay, becauſe I am not the hand, I am not of the body, is it therefore not of the bodie? And verſ. 22: Such as we think to be the more baſe members of the body, vpon them we put more abundant honour. And verſ. 24: And if one member ſuffer, all the members ſuffer with it; if one member glorie, all the members glory with it.
                  
                  11 Well then, Luther ſaid, compare member with member, and one is more noble than the other: S. Paul ſaith, there are members both more honourable, and more baſ

Peter is a part more noble, and I am but a baſe one, he confeſſeth that there is a manifeſt inequalitie in theſe members, ſome being more firme in faith, and ſome leſſe holy in life than others.
                  
                  12 This doctrine of more and leſſe holy, of noble and baſe members, doth it certainly confirme Iouinianiſme? doth it not rather euidently confute & confound it? Yet this is our Aduerſaries guiſe, whenſoeuer they light vpon any tooth of this dead Lion, they treade vpon it with contēpt; neuer conſidering that as

No: one Coccius, a late Romaniſt, doth further purſue them; heare therefore

                     Iouinian taught (ſaith Coccius,) that all ſinnes are equall, which is the doctrine of Luther, who ſaith that no ſinne is in it nature veniall, but all damnable and mortal. Hardly ſhould we haue thought that any Aduerſarie reputed learned could haue bene ſo vulgarly witted, as to make ſuch a conſequence: All ſinnes are in their nature mortall, Ergo, equall. Therfore we ſend this their Coccius to be catechized from the rules of common ſenſe, according as their owne Ieſuite can informe him; ſhewing that as in the Iudiciall lawes of the

And the verie poſition it ſelfe, which defineth euery ſinne to be in it owne nature mortall, is both related and approued by their owne 
                        See hereafter cap. 22. Sect. 4. Doctors.
                  14 The ſumme is, that firſt, according vnto imputatiue iuſtice, all are equally iuſtified. Secondly, that in reſpect of inherent iuſtice, all men are not equally iuſt. Thirdly, that Chriſtians being compared with the whole bodie, are equally members; but being compared one with another, are not equally holy. Fourthly, that although ſinnes be in nature (aequè peccata) that is, all mortall, yet are they not aequalitèr peccata, that is, equally heinous. Theſe being the principall points profeſſed by Proteſtants, and ſo plainly verified and iuſtified by their owne Authors, we haue confirmed vnto vs the ſtrength of truth, quae magna eſt, & praeualet.

                  SECT. 1.
                  FIrſt, impoſsible is a word too enuious, therfore may it not be ſuffred to paſſe without a ſlit, by diſtinguiſhing of impoſsibility; which is either abſolute,

as though God could not perfect his creature, who hath made the Archāgels, powers, and dominations; this were not onely an hereſie, but alſo a perfect blaſphemie. Otherwiſe it is taken ſuppoſitiuely, with reſpect vnto the wil of God, as when we ſay, it is impoſsible for a man, when he will, to flie vp into heauen; not that God cannot enable man herunto, but that it ſtandeth not with Gods ordinance, & wil of wiſdome, to grant man this Angelicall perfection. Which ſence is proper vnto this queſtion, according as their Sciendum tamen eſt ex eodem Auguſtino, hanc tantam iuſtitiae perfectionem, quantam praeter vnum Chriſtum, nemo hac vita vel aſſecutus ſit, vel aſſecuturus, non negandam eſte Deo poſſibilem, ſed fieri ab eo poſſe, cuius hic exemplum deſit, quia ei omnia facilia ſint, nedum poſſibilia, & apud eum, ac in eius virtute cau

Eſſet autem tanta, ſi & nihil eorum quae ad iuſtitiam pertinent, nos lateret, & ea ſic animum delectarent, vt quicquid aliud voluptas vel dolor impedit, delectatio illa ſuperaret; quod vt non ſit, ad Dei iudicium, non ad impoſſibilitatem pertinet: ſic ſine exemplo eſt in hominibus perfecta iuſtitia, nec tamen impoſſibilis. Eſpencaeus Epiſc. in 2. Tim. 3. pag. 126. Biſhop hath obſerued out of S. Auguſtine, who denieth that ſimple impoſsbility, as though God could not make a man perfect in this life; but confeſſeth, that yet none is perfect, the cauſe whereof is to be reſerued vnto Gods iuſtice. And thus do all vnderſtand impoſsibilitie in this Article.
                  2 Secondly, by man is not meant the vnregenerate; for ſo we might fight without an Aduerſarie, becauſe the Romaniſts confeſſe it an Aut certè exiſtimant, poſſe hominem ſeruare propri

Dauids tune, who ſung, placebo, not placeo [I will pleaſe God (ſaith he) in the region of the liuing:] that is (ſaith S. Hierome) after this life, in heauen, becauſe he could not ſay, I do pleaſe God in this life, which is the region of the dead. And this he thinketh to haue bene the ſong of all Apoſtles, and holy men. Thus much S. Hierome, from the relation of their owne Biſhop: whereupon we gather, that S. Hierome ſaying, that the moſt iuſt cannot properly pleaſe God in this life, doth fully diſſent from our Aduerſaries, who ſay, that the iust man may abſolutely fulfill the law of God in this life.
                  
                  5 Saint Auguſtine will not be denied to haue bene a Catholicke, who (as their Biſhop ſaith) reigneth in this argument, and is confeſſed to ſay, that Facere non poſſum, quin ex Auguſtino nonnihil ſubligam: regnat in hoc argumento:—is in lib. 2. de pecc. merit. & remiſl. ca. 13. Poteſt fieri vt aliquis ſit perfectus,—in eo quòd omnes homines diligat, etiam inimicos, non in eatamen perfectione, vt quos diligit, tantum diligat, quantū incommutabilis regula veritatis diligendos eſſe praeſcripſit: nec ideo quiſquam prorſus ſine peccato eſſe intelligitur, qui aliqua re dicitur eſſe perfectus; quan quam & in hoc ita dici poteſt, vt non quia iam non eſt, quo proficiat, ſed quia maximâ ex parte profecit.—Et lib. 4. cap. 11. ex Ambroſio: Videmus (inquit) impoſſibile eſſe. vt perfectè quis immaculatus ſit, in hoc corpore conſtitutus Et lib 2. contra Iulianum; Vos feſtinatis, & praeſumptionem veſtram feſtinando praecipitatis, hîc enim vnltis hominem perfici, & vtinam Dei dono, non libero, ſed ſeruo potius arbitrio, à qua perfectione longe vos eſſe ſentitis: ſed dolus eſt in ore veſtro, ſiue peccatores vos eſſe dicatis, & iuſtos credi velitis, ſiue profiteamini perfectionem iuſtitiae, quam profectò in vobis non eſſe ſentitis. Ex Eſpencaeo quo ſupra, pag. 125. 
                     a man cannot loue God, as much as the inuiolable rule of truth doth preſcribe: with diuerſe other ſentences to the ſame effect. And doubtleſſe, as long as S. Auguſtine reigneth in this argument, Proteſtants cannot poſſibly faile in their cauſe: for he, in deſpaire of perfection by the law, teacheth euery one to flie vnto the perfection of the Goſpell, after the example of iuſt Et ſi eſt aliquod peccatum, quod vitari non poſſit, quo modo iuſtus Deus dicitur, ſi imputare cuiquam creditur, quod vitari non poſſit?

Si enim modò eſt, non omni animae fideli poſitae in corpore mortis huius orandum eſt, & dicendum, Dimitte nobis debita noſtra: cùm iam in ſancto Baptiſmo vniuerſa fuerint dimiſſa praeterita. Quiſquis autem membris fidelibus Chriſti hoc non eſſe orandum perſuadere conatur, nihil aliud quàm ſeipſum Chriſtianum non eſſe profitetur. Auguſt Tom 7. lib. de perfectauſtit. ad rat. 15. & 16.

                  6 Ambroſe was a Catholike Biſhop, whoſe teſtimonie their Biſhop hath inſerted, out of S. Auguſtine, viz.

                     We ſeee it to be impoſsible (ſaith Ambroſe) for any man liuing in this life, to be perfect and ſpotleſſe.
                  
                  7 Saint Bernard, a Father of later times, and appropriated by theſe Apologiſts, as an abſolute Romaniſt; whom, as they hold him to haue bene a Saint powerfull in See aboue, Miracles, ſo do we acknowledge him to haue bene (in compariſon of that generation among whom he liued) a miraculous Saint: heare we then the profeſſion of a Saint: Nam in affectu, quis ita habet charitatem, vt mandatur? ergo illa mandatur ad meritum, illa in pramium datur: cuius initium quidem profectumqm; vitam quoque praeſentem experiri diuinâ poſſe gratiâ, non negamus: ſed planè conſummationem defendimus futurae foelicitatis. Quomodo ergo iubenda fuit, quae implenda nullo modo erat? aut ſi placet tibi magis de affectuali datum fuiſſe mandatum, non inde contendo, dummodo acquieſcas & tu mihi, quòd minimè in vita iſta ab aliquo hominum poſſit, vel potet

                        ent ſauè ad quem iuſtitiae finem niti pro viribus oporteret. Ergo mandando impoſſibilia, non praeuaricatores homines fecit, ſed humiles, vt omne os obſtruatur, & ſubditus fiat omnis mundus Deo: quia ex operibus legis non iuſtificabitur omnis caro coram illo: accipientes quippe mandatum, & ſentientes defectum, clamabimus in coelū, & miſerebitur noſtri Deus: & ſciemus in illa die, quâ non ex operibus iuſtitiae, quae fecimus nos, ſed ſecundū ſuā miſericordiā ſaluos nos fecit. Bernar. ſuper Cant ſer. 50. p. 931. 
                     No man (ſaith S. Bernard) can fulfill the law of God in this life. Then preuenting an obiection, which our Aduerſaries do ordinarily vſe. Doth God then command things impoſsible? he granteth it, but yet ſo, that God thereby doth not make man a tranſgreſſor, but humbleth him, to the intent that man perceiuing his owne defect, might in renouncing his righteouſneſſe by works, flie vnto Gods mercie and grace. And indeed, the law is not to be called impoſsible for man, à quo, from whom original ſinne came:

(Adam being created in a perfection might haue had a poſſe non peccare) but in reſpect of man, in quo, in whom the rebellious corruption doth now dwell (vntil it be diuorced by death,) whereby he hath in one degree or other a non poſſe non peccare, vntill he come vnto the region of the liuing, where only there is non poſſe peccare, that is, an impoſsibility of ſinning.
                  
                  8 We forbeare accumulation of teſtimonies: theſe alreadie mentioned will plainly ſhew how farre the true and ancient Catholickes did differ from the newly pretended, by the difference of their language (as S. Ierome his Cannot pleaſe God in this life; and S. Auguſtines, Cannot loue according to the preſcript of the law; and S. Ambroſe his, It is impoſsible to be perfect; and S. Bernard his, It is impoſsible to fulfill the law:) if they be compared with the aboue-ſpecified Romiſh Article, viz. A iuſt man may abſolutely fulfill the law of God.

                  9 Doctor Stapleton, although he ſweate in defending the poſſibilitie of keeping the law, yet (as though his breath had failed him) we heare him panting: Haec tamen impletio legis non intelligitur neceſſariò & praeciſè in omnibus mandatis legis, toto tempore & curſu iuſtitiae humanae; ſed ille cenſetur implere legem, ſatisfacere legi, & in conſpectu Dei iuſtus habetur, qui voluntatem & affectum habens implendi vniuerſa legis, eatenus implet, quatenus humana fragilitas in reliqu: js naturae corruptae, per gratiam implere in hac vita vel poteſt, vel ſolet. Haec propoſitio manifeſtè confirmatur per celeberr. illam Eccleſiae doctrinam, contra Pelagianos olim definitam: neminem etiam iuſtorum in hac vita ſine peccato viuere. Stapleton de Iuſtific. lib. 6. de perfect. Iuſtit. c 3. initio.
                      
                     Yet this fulfilling of the law (ſaith he) is not to be vnderstood neceſſarily and preciſely of all the commandements of the law, in the whole courſe of mans iuſtice: but he may be ſaid to ſatisfie the law, and to be iust in the ſight of God, who hath a will and affection to fulfill all the commandements, ſo farre as the infirmitie of nature, ſtrengthned by grace, will permit. And in the end he yeeldeth vnto the doctrine of the Church long ſince eſtabliſhed againſt the Pelagians, which teacheth that no man liueth without ſinne. This Doctor, his [not preciſely fulfilling the law of God] cannot but fight againſt their generall poſition, of abſolutely fulfilling the law of God.

                     There is a double iuſtice, one before men, (which is, to deale vprightly with all men;) another before God, which may be conſidered either by making compariſon with God himſelfe (in which reſpect the Angels are vncleane,) and ſo Chriſt onely is the iuſt one: or elſe comparing our life and iuſtice with Gods law vnto man, which law is the rule of iuſtice. Againe, this law may be vnderſtood either in the full perfection of it, which is propounded vnto man as a ſcope ſtil to aime at, rather than a bond of Obligation, by exacting anſwerable obedience; becauſe God knowing our infirmitie doth not exact of vs that which is impoſsible. But why? He is a gracious Father, no rigid exactor of thoſe things, which do indeed exceed our ſtrength.
                  
                  12 Secondly, (ſaith he) the ſame law may be conſidered, as it is applied, and modified, with reſpect vnto our infirmity: then he determineth the queſtion; In the firſt reſpect (as the law requireth perfection,) no fleſh can be iuſtified, but mans righteouſneſſe is no better than a menſtruous cloath. In the ſecond conſideration, as the law i
                           •
                         tempered and qualified vnto mans infirmitie, and imperfect obedience, yet is not man iustifiable before God hereby: in briefe, no mortall man can ſhew his iuſtice anſwerable (meaning in 
                        •
                     ither reſpect) vnto the direction of Gods law, but ſtandeth conuicted of iniustice, & thereby is vnder Gods malediction, due vnto ſinne, and periſheth, except God in his mercie grant him daily pardon for his offences. This witneſſe concludeth with vs, that whether the law of God be taken in the rigour, or in the temper; yet no man is a fulfiller of the law: therefore, if he hope to be ſaued, muſt according to Pigghius his concluſion, renounce all his iuſtification by his owne righteouſneſſe, and flie vnto the iuſtification by faith, through the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt Ieſus, impu

                     ed vnto vs.
                  13 And thus one of the greateſt Aduerſaries of the Proteſtants is become one of their greateſt Aduocates, in deſending of iuſtification by faith onely, the

greateſt Article of the religion of Proteſtants. Which hath bene confirmed by the conſent of diuerſe Romaniſts, notwithſtanding it do flatly contradict this poſition of the abſolute fulfilling of the law: yet leſt they may be thought to haue ſome euaſion, by diſtinction of ſinne, we referre our Reader vnto an ample

                  SECT. 4.
                  14 This Article of the impoſsibilitie of keeping Gods command, according to the difference of conſtruction, is both damnably blaſphemous, and infallibly true; the ſtate of man being threefold: one is his firſt creation; to ſay that it was impoſsible then for man to haue kept the commandement, was the blaſphemie of the Manichees. The ſecond is his fall, and bondage in ſinne; and to denie that it is impoſsible for man, without grace, to keepe the commandement, was the blaſphemie of the Pelagians. His third ſtation is his ſtate of grace, wherein mans keeping of the commandement, hath a double aſpect; firſt it looketh vpon the right ſide of Gods mercy, who according to his fatherly acceptance in Chriſt, vouchſafeth the imperfect obedience of his children, who ſtill contend vnto perfection: and to call this keeping of Gods commandement impoſsible, both Fathers and Proteſtants do iudge to be an hereticall opinion. Secondly it beholdeth God on the leſt ſide, cying onely the ſtrictneſſe of his iuſtice according to the exact rigour of his own law; and to beleeue that man can poſsibly keepe the law ſo exactly, is a Pelagian hereſie condemned by the Fathers.

                     There are at this day who equall the ſtate of men, in perfection of iuſtice, with the perfection which is next vnto the Angels, which is one of the relicks of Pelagianiſme; than the which as no hereſie can be more pernicious, ſo is there old hereſie more reuiued at this day.

                     EXorciſme was in, and long after the time of the primitiue Church, ſo viſible and miraculous a power of expelling of Diuels by adiuration, that S. Cyprian in his daies durſt challenge Demetrianus to come and trie what was the vertue thereof in the Church: Quod autem Scapulae Tertullianus, hoc Demetriano ſic ſuggeſſit Cyprian is: O ſi audire eos velles, quando à nobis ad

                     vſed in thoſe times, both in Baptiſme, and out of Baptiſme, by thoſe who were endewed with the gift of Exorcization. Exſufflation, or puffing with the mouth, was but Exſufflatio eſt ceremonia annexa Exorciſmo—nam verbis Exorciſmorum expelluntur Daemones, & caeremoniá exufflationis ſignificatur eorum expulſio.

                     a ceremonie annexed vnto Exorciſme, in ſignification that the Diuell was expelled: but our queſtion is whether this Exorciſme be neceſſarie in Baptiſme? Their Durand ſaith, that Et eſt notandum, quòd

Catechiſmus autem & Exorciſmus Neophytorum ſunt; praecedunt enim Baptiſmum, & magis debent dici Sacramentalia, quàm Sacramenta. i. ad ſacramentum Baptiſmi pertinentia, vel praeludia noui Baptiſmi: ſine eis tamen poteſt eſſe Baptiſmus. Durandus lib. 6. Rational. cap. 82. pag. 687. num. 8. 
                     Exorciſme is but a Sacramentall adiunct, and no Sacrament; and that Baptiſme is perfect without it.
                  
                  2 Where then was the hereſie of Iulianus the Pelagianiſt? S. Auguſtine ſheweth, that he Sed perfectè Pelagianus eſt, qui malum originale non credit. Neque enim ex quo eſſe coepit Manichaei peſtilentioſa doctrina, ex illo coeperunt in Eccleſia Dei paruuli baptizandi exorcizari, & exufflari, vt ipſis myſterijs oſtenderetur, non eos in regnu Chriſti niſi erutos à tenebrarum poteſtate, transferri. Auguſt. Tom. 7. de Nupt. & Concupiſc. l. 2. c. 29. pag. 855. 
                     did not beleeue that children are conceiued in originall ſinne, and that conſequently by nature they are not the ſonnes of wrath, and of the Diuell: therefore did he contemne Exorciſme, & Exſufflation, by which myſteries there is ſignified (ſaith S. Auguſtine,) that children, except they be freed first from the power of darkneſſe (which is the Diuell) they canot enter into the kingdome of Chriſt. Therefore the marrow of his error was the deniall of mans

naturall corruption, and the power of Gods grace in mans regeneration: for the which cauſe the Proteſtants, with the whole Church of God, haue alwaies condemned that Iulianus for a moſt peſtilent heretike.
                  3 As for Exorciſme, we may thus determine: It was in ancient times a miraculous and extraordinary gift, and a ſenſible expulſion of Diuels, which gift is long ſithence 
                        See this largely proued, and confeſſed aboue, lib. 3. cap. 17, 18, 19. & deinceps.
                      ceaſſed: but now Exorciſme is an ordinarie imitation of that ſame gift, which in theſe daies is out of date. Then it was, vpon iuſt occaſions, neceſſarie, now in Baptiſme it is held not neceſſarie by our Aduerſaries themſelues, in whoſe Church many millions of infants are baptized without Exorciſme, or Exufflation, except they ſhall admit their women-Baptiſts into the order of their Exorciſts.
                  
                  4 Notwithſtanding, Exorciſme and Exufflation, being a tradition ſo ancient, and containing a ſigne of mans deliuerance out of the power of Satan, may according vnto the diſcretion of diuerſe Churches, be vſed or omitted; and ſo it is, for Non habent donum expellendi Daemonia, qualis igitur apud ipſos eſt ordo exorciſtarum?

                  THE PROTESTANTS APPEALE: Firſt ſhewing what was the doctrine of the Donatiſts.
                  SECT. 1.
                  
                     TRuly haue our Aduerſaries obſerued from S. Auguſtine, that the doctrine of the Donatiſts conſiſted in three points; Firſt, the perſons: See Bellarm▪ confeſſing this in the Sections following. 
                     They thought that the Church did conſiſt only of iuſt men: Secōdly, for

the place, Si autem vniuerſos Donatiſtas non audiuimus, ſe pro Eccleſia Chriſti ſupponentes, quia nullum pro ſe de diuinis libris teſtimonium proferunt, quo id doceant: quanto minus, to go te, Rogatiſtas audire debemus, qui nec illud pro ſe interpretari conabuntur, quod ſcriptum eſt, Vbi paſcis, vbi cubas in meridie? Cant. 17. Si enim hoc loco Scripturarum meridies Africa intelligenda eſt, in parte Donati, quae ſub coeli feruentiori plaga eſt, omnes vos Maximianiſtae ſuperabunt, quorum ſchiſma in Bizantio, & in Tripoli exarſit. Sed confligant cum eis Arzuges, & hoc magis ad ſe pertinere contendant; Mauritania tamen Caeſarienſis, occidentali quàm meridianae patti vicinior, quando nec Africam ſe vult dici, quomodo de meridie gloriabitur? non dico aduerſus orbem terrarum, ſed aduerſus ipſam partem Donati, vnde pars Rogati breuiſl. fruſtum de fruſto maiore praeciſum eſt.

                     That there was no Church but in Africke. Thirdly, their reaſon only from an allegorical & peruerſe expoſition of Scripture, becauſe Chriſt anſwering his ſpouſe in the Canticles, where he lieth? he ſaid, in meridie, that is, in the South; the Donatiſts concluding therupō, that the Church was wholy periſhed frō the earth, and onely profeſſed in the South of Africke among thēſelues: whom S. Auguſtine did learnedly confute. This is the Donatian hereſie. Now ſee vnfolded
               
               
                  
                     The diuerſe Traducements, vſed by the Romaniſts againſt Proteſtants, to bring them into the guilt of Donatiſme.
                  SECT. 2.
                  2 Many of our Romiſh Aduerſaries looke vpon the doctrine of Proteſtants, but ſome more ſiniſterly than others: for ſome of them, ſuppoſing the Proteſtants to teach an abſolute apoſtaſie of the vniuerſall Church of Chriſt, haue bent all their forces to confute them; but (as their Cardinall teſlifieth) Notandum autem eſt, multos cx noſtris teinpus terere, dum probant abſolutè Eccleſiam non poſſe deficere: nam Caluinus & caeteri haeretici id concedunt, ſed dicunt, intelligi debere de Eccleſia inuiſibili. Bellar. l. 3. de Eccleſ. milit. cap. 13. initio. So that the Rhemiſts annot. in 1. Tim. 3. ver. 15. Reinolds Caluino. Turc. l. 1. c. 10. and others, may ſeeme herein to haue ſwet in vaine.
                      
                     with lost labour, becauſe Protestants teach (ſaith he) that the inuiſible Church of Chriſt can neuer periſh.
                  
               
               
                  Their ſecond Traducement.
                  SECT. 3.
                  3 Although the Cardinall will ſeeme to be more conſcionable, by reſtraining his ſpeech vnto the Church viſible, yet is his accuſation notably calumnious. Firſt, Donatiſte Eccleſiain ex ſolis iuſtis conſtare volebant, atque inde d

Inſt. c. 2. §. 2. Bellar. l. 4. de notis Eccleſ. cap. 9. §. Donatiſtae. 
                     The Donatiſts (ſaith he) taught, that the Church conſiſteth onely of godly men, and thereupon gathered that it was periſhed from the face of the earth, remaining onely among themſelues in Africke: So Caluine teacheth, that the Church conſisteth onely of good men.
                  
                  4 So Caluine? Let vs heare Càluine ſpeake, 
                        In the volume of the ſame booke: Fuerunt enim ſemper, qui falſa abſolutae ſanctimoniae perſuaſione imbuti, tanquam acrij quidam daemones iam facti eſſent, omnium hominum conſortium aſpernarentur, in quibus humanum adhuc aliquid ſubeſſe cernerent, tales enim erant Cathari, & (qui ad corum veſaniam accedebant) Donatiſtae. 
                     There are certaine aërit diuels (ſaith he) ſuch as are the Cathari, and after them the Donatiſts, who vpon a preſumption of their owne ſanctitie, ſeparate themſelues from others. And he 
                        A little after: Peccant illi,—quia enim non putant eſſe Eccleſiam, vbi non eſt ſolida vitae puritas, & intcgritas, ſcelcrum odio à legitima Eccleſia diſcedunt, dum à factione improborum declinare ſe putant: Allegant &c. Caluinus Inſtitut. lib. 4. cap. 1. §. 13. refelleth the ground of their hereſie, which is, to thinke that a Chriſtian may not
                     
                     continue in that Church, wherein there is not an integritie in the Profeſſors of the ſame truth.

The inuiſible he will haue to conſiſt onely of the holy and elect ones (which accordeth with the Article of our Creed, beleeuing an holy Catholike Church:) but of the viſible he ſaith, It is a conſpicuous multitude, participating in the ſame Sacraments, &c. Among whom he 
                        See Calcuin ibid. §. 9. confeſſeth there are hypocrites and wicked men, although not as true members, yet as outward profeſſors of the ſame faith. Finally he hath already condemned the phrenſy of the Donatiſts, for ſeparating thēſelues from the viſible Church, becauſe of the cōmixture of Tares with the Wheat. So that this hereſie of the Donatiſts, in acknowledging no viſible Church, but wherein all were outwardly holy and iuſt, as it had neuer greater Aduerſarie among the Fathers, than S. Auguſtine, ſo had not S. Auguſtine euer any more zealous follower of him herein than Caluine.

                  6 Compare we now the Donatiſts and Protestants together: the Donatiſts ſaid, that the viſible Church admitteth no mixture of wicked with the godly; the Protestants denie this. The Donatiſts held the Church viſible to be itremoueable from Africke: the Proteſtants confute that. The Donatiſts taught the Church to be ſo properly and peculiarly tyed vnto one place, that th
                        •
                     re cannot poſſibly be elſe-where any true Church: the Protestants condemne this, who hold that the Church in her members may poſſeſſe the whole world; and that ſome without liuing in corrupt Churches, (who erre not obſtinately) may poſſibly be ſaued. Yet did their Cardinall preſume to aſſociate Donatists and Protestants, that is, to ioyne the Pole-articke and Antarticke together. We ſee they, by peruerting good meanings, haue turned wine into water, and reſerued their worſt vnto the laſt.
                  7 Yet one ſcruple would be remoued, to wit; Whether the Catholike viſible Church may not ſometimes be drawne into certaine parts of the world, but muſt neceſſarily poſſeſſe alwaies all the coaſts thereof. Their Ieſuite Coſter ſaith, We may thinke that Non enim ex co dicitur Eccleſia Catholica, quòd eodem tempore totius orbis ditiones occupet; hoc quippè ne in hūc vſque diem fortaſſis contingit, quando Antarcticis hominibus, & qui extremas remotiſſimaſue Americae oras incolunt, ſides Chriſti nunquā innotuit: ſed his potiſſimùm duabus de cauſis, tum quia nulli nationi, vt olim lex Moyſi Iudaeis, ſit alligata, nulloue loco concluſa, ſicut Donatiſtarum & Lutheranorū errores; quorum hi extra Germaniā nu

                     the Pope of Rome cannot erre in faith; that the See aboue: which, as the Donatiſts, they found vpon allegoricall expoſitions of Scripture.

                  THE PROTESTANTS APPEALE.
                  SECT. 1.
                  
                     AS though there were yet ſundrie other hereſies defended by Proteſtants, which the Apologizers thought good to omit. We cannot be perſwaded that they do this in fauor of Proteſtants; for how wil they ſurceaſe to preſſe and ſting them with ſundrie other true Accuſations (if they had any ſuch) whom they haue alreadie ſo greatly iniuried with ſo ſundry falſe ones? or that they omit them in their deſire to See aboue often 
                     auoid tediouſneſſe, who by multiplicitie of repetitions haue bene, and ſtill continue to be ſo ſuperſtitiouſly ſuperfluous? We rather attribute it vnto their art of Rhetoricke, whereby they will ſeeme to paſſe ouer other the like errors, as euidently proued by others; which they themſelues do therefore omit, becauſe they cannot proue them.
                  2 Therefore haue we recalled this their Parentheſis (to omit &c.) backe againe, becauſe it engendreth a blacke ſuſpition of ſundrie other hereſies, which they might haue alledged from their Cardinall Bellarmine, of whom they borrowed almoſt all their former exceptions, which they haue not ſpared to relate at large. Now it will pleaſe the Apologiſts to ſtand aſide a litle, and to giue place vnto their fellowes, and ſuffer them to proſecute ſuch their other Accuſations, which they themſelues haue ſo artificially omitted.
                  
                  
                     
                        The firſt Accuſation in the queſtion of ſola fides, from the example of three kinds of ancient Heretikes, Simonians, Eunomians, and a nameleſſe third, more ancient than them both.

                     Firſt, Simoniani docebant, ſaluari homines ſecundùm gratiā Simonis; quem Deum faciebant: & non ſecundùm operas iuſtas, inquit Irenaeus lib. 1. cap. 20. 
                        The Simonian Hereticks thought that they might be ſaued by the grace of Simon Magus, without exerciſing of any good works. Secondly, Eunomiani ſimiliter docebant non poſſe homini vlla peccata nocere, modò fidem habeat, vt Auguſtinus teſtatur, lib. de haereſ. c. 54.

                     the faith (ſaith he) which thoſe hereticks taught, was the doctrine of faith: but the faith held by Luther, is a ſpeciall confidence, namely in Gods mercies through Chriſt. Secondly, the heretikes maintained that ſaith to be ſufficient to ſaluation, which reiected all care of good works: but our heretikes (ſaith he, meaning Proteſtants) teach ſuch a faith, which they ſay, cannot be alone, or void of good works.
                  
                  4 The difference thus ſtandeth, that the heretikes vnderſtood by faith, onely the doctrine of faith, to know it; but the Proteſtants preach a faith, which is a full affiance in the mercie of God, through Chriſt Ieſus, vnto euerie faithfull repentant; which difference is as much, as the knowing of Phyſicke, and applying it. Secondly, the heretikes broached a ſaith, which contemneth all good works; and the Proteſtants profeſſe a ſaith, which cannot but embrace good works. We may adde, the faith of the Simonians depended vpon the

Thrice damned be the Proteſtants, if they teach ſuch a faith; yea or if they do not vtterly condemne it: and excuſable be their accuſers, if they proue their accuſation; yea and if they do not alſo diſproue it, who acknowledge concerning Proteſtants, that they profeſſe onely ſuch a iuſtifying faith,

                  The hereſie of the Florini was to make God the cauſe of ſinne: the which is the doctrine of Proteſtants, in teaching that God did not onely permit ſinne.

                  THE PROTESTANTS APPEALE: By the testimonies of their Romiſh Aduerſaries.
                  
                  SECT. 1.
                  
                     SAint Auguſtine hath ſet downe the expreſſe hereſie of the Florini dicebant Deum creâſſe mala; contra quod ſcriptum eſt, fecit Deus omnia, & ecce valdè bona. Aug. de hareſ Tom. 6 hareſ. 66. 
                     Florini; who ſaid (ſaith he) that God created euill, contrary vnto Scripture, where it is written, God ſaw all that he had made, and behold all was very good. Did euer any Proteſtant deliuer ſuch a blaſphemie, ſo much as in a dreame?
                  2 Maſter Caluine, who is moſt impugned in this point, teacheth his Reader to auoid the iniquitie of thoſe men, Iacobus peccatorum authorem meritò Deum eſſe negat; admonitio neceſſaria, ne nos Deum loco noſtro ſubſtituamus, acſi nos. ipſe ad peccandum impelleret. Summa eſt, fruſtra tergiuerſari homines, qui vitiorum ſuorum culpam reijciunt in Deū, quia non ex alio fonte proueniunt mala, quàm ex mala cuinſque cordis concupiſcentia Caluinus comm. in Iac. 1.

                      his opinion of induration of the heart of the vngodly, by a more than permiſsion of God, through his iuſt power and prouidence, it 
                        See aboue lib. 3. cap. 6. hath bene iuſtified from the iudgement of S. Auguſtine, by the teſtimonies of their owne Ieſuits Pererius and Suarez. Neither was his doctrine of eternall decree ſuch as can iuſtly preiudice Gods iuſtice, the concluſion whereof is this: Sed nos, qui nouimus cunctos homines tot nominibus Dei tribunali obnoxios, vt de mille interrogati, ne in vno quidem ſatisfacere poſſint, confitemur nihil pati reprobos, quod non iuſtiſſimo Dei iudicio conueniat. Caluinus Inſtit. l. 3. c. 24. §. 14. 
                     We confeſſe that the reprobates ſuffer nothing, which is not agreeable and conſonant vnto the most iuſt iudgement of God. Which might be manifeſted, if that this Section would admit any large diſpute. It will be ſufficient for our preſent diſcharge to know that theſe moſt fierce and oppoſite Accuſers could not produce any one Proteſtant, who did not abhorre to impute the cauſe of ſinne vnto God: vnto whoſe iudgement we referre this their accuſation, and the authors thereof. Now we adioyne

                  3 The ſaying of Origen is not altogether ſo hereticall, but that their owne Alphonſus can reconcile it with a Catholicke truth: for Imprimis illud mihi dubiū eſt. an Origenes ſenſerit hominē per peceatum aliquid de ſua ſubſtantia perdidiſſe, an ſolùm qualitates animae aliquas, vel vt ſub al

                     Image (ſaith he) may be taken either for an eſſentiall propertie, or for ſome qualitie. In the firſt acception of the word Image, the doctrine of Origen is manifeſtly erroneous; in the ſecond ſence it is free from ſuſpition of hereſie. So that Origen might poſſibly haue had an orthodoxall meaning; which their Ieſuite Vaſquez doth reſolue more directly, who (leſt that S. Auguſtine might incurre the ſame condemnation with Origen) doth acquit them both, by diſtinguiſhing of the Image of God in man;

                     which may ſignifie (ſaith he) either the naturall impreſsion, which God made in the intellectuall part of man, as namely his will and memorie, which cannot be altogether extinguiſhed: or elſe ſome ſpirituall qualitie of grace, as loue and iuſtice, whereby man hath a likeneſſe of God; which mage of God, man vtterly loſt by his ſinne: according to the which ſence (ſaith he) we are to expound S. Auguſtine and Origen.

                     if by Image be not meant nature it ſelfe, but the Mans conformitie vnto godlineſſe, as many ancient Authors (amongſt whom he nameth S. Ambroſe) vnderstood it, it may be allowed. Now followeth

Thus then we ſee that by Image of God, he vnderſtandeth onely vertuous qualities, whileſt he ſaith, that the Image of God is blotted out: but elſewhere taking the Image of God for the naturall and eſſentiall properties, Vno ergo verbo poenitentiam interpretor regenerationem, cuius non eſt alius ſcopus, niſi vt imago Dei, quae per Adae tranſgreſſionem foedata, & tantùm non obliterata fuerat, in nobis reformetur.

                  6 Marke now: Origen ſpake doubtfully, and their Ieſuits acquit him by interpreting that by Image he meant not any eſſentiall propertie, but vertuous qualities. Here Caluine ſpeaketh not doubtfully, but expreſly, interpreting himſelfe, that by the Image of God in man, he meant but onely vertuous qualities; and he remaineth in their cenſure condemned. But either muſt Caluine be iuſtified, or elſe the ancient Fathers (ſuch as were Auguſtine, Ambroſe, Bede, Euthymius, Bernard, and other Fathers, together with Alphonſus, Vaſques, Maldonate, the Romiſh Doctors and moderators of this cauſe) muſt together with Caluine be with him ioyntly condemned. Happie is Caluins caſe, who hath no accuſers but ſuch as can in their conſcience acquit him. Miſerable are thoſe accuſers, whoſe accuſation is thus inexcuſable.

                  the heretikes called Peputians, gaue vnto women a gouernment, onely that they might be honoured in the office of Prieſtdome: ſuch like is the article of Luther, who taught that a woman, or boy might abſolue as well as a Biſhop, or the Pope himſelfe. And the Caluiniſts in England are not vnlike; among whom there reigneth a woman Pope.
               
               
                  THE PROTESTANTS APPEALE: By the confeſsions of their Aduerſaries.
                  
                  SECT. 1.
                  
                     LVther his meaning is rightly conceiued by their owne Biſhop Roffenſis, to wit; when either man or woman ſhall comfort any penitēt ſoule with the words of the Goſpel, & the contrite party beleeueth, he findeth remiſſiō of his ſins; At huius aſſertionis Lutherus ſumit anſam, quòd ex proximè ſuperiori ſe collegiſſe putat, totam vim delendae culpae non in Miniſtro, ſed in fide credentis ſitam eſſe: & non poteſtati Miniſtrorum, ſed fidei (qua in Dei verbum credimus) remiſſionis effectum eſſe tribuendum: quamobrem & iam adijcit, quòd etiamſi mulier aut puer haec verba proferat, peccator haec audiens, & credens, protinùs abſolutus eſt. Roffenſis Epiſc. art. 13. fol. 134. 
                     Not by any power of the man or woman, but by the vertue of the Goſpell, which is the power of
                     
                     God vnto ſaluation; this begetteth no confuſion in the Miniſtery: but as when it ſhall happen in any mans diſeaſe, that a woman doth tell what herbe ſhe hath foūd to be a ſoueraigne remedy for that diſeaſe, which the party doth vſe with ſucceſſe, ſhe is not thereby made a Phyſitian: accordingly a faithful deuout penitent by the words of grace may receiue comfort, & hope of remiſſion, cuen from the mouth of any Chriſtian, whom notwithſtanding he doth not acknowledge to be a profeſſed Miniſter, or his officiall Abſoluer.
                  2 As for that Lady-Queene Elizabeth, and Queene of Ladies, what Prieſtly function did ſhe euer exerciſe? Onely ſhe commaunded the tribe of Leui to performe their offices with faithfulneſſe, according to her charge, whereof ſhe was to giue account vnto God; for it is Regall. In other duties which are as meerely Eccleſiaſtical, as is preaching of the Word, or miniſtring of the Sacraments, ſhe was as abſolutely no Prieſt, as was her renowmed ſiſter Queene Mary, whom the Romiſh alwaies honoured with the title of Catholike. Happie therefore is the memorie of that our Queene, whom the verie malignance of rancorous ſlanderers doth daily make more glorious. See now

Bellar. l. 4. de not is Eccleſ. cap. 9. §. 5. Proclus. 
                        The heretike Proculus or Proclus did ſay, that ſinne did liue in the regencrate, and thought concupiſcence to be a ſinne, not taken away by Baptiſme, as did the Meſſaliani. Which is the verie doctrine of Luther, Caluine, and Melancthon.

                  SECT. 3.
                  4 The queſtion in Epiphanius is not whether concupiſcence be a ſinne, or abſolutely whether it liue in the regenerate, but whether it liue that life of 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

                        The words of Proculus or Proclus are theſe: Peccatum in nobis viuit And againe, Ne haberet homo malum immortale peccatum praedominans. Apud Epiphan. haereſ. 64. and M

Apud Epiphan. ibid.
                      
                     Methodius in his confutation do plainly ſhew, arguing thus: If this be the nature of fleſh, that it cannot be ſubiected vnto the ſpirit, why doth the Apoſtle thus exhort 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      
                     &c. Let not ſinne reigne in your mortall bodies to bring forth the luſts thereof; and againe, the ſpirit of life by Chriſt hath altogether ouercome that reigning ſinne? And we know that the Apoſtle, who will not haue ſinne to be a King to 
                        Rom 6. 
                     reigne, doth notwithſtanding acknowledge it to remaine as a rebell in the regenerate, 
                        Rom. 7. 23. a cording to the Rhemiſts Tranſt.

                     , that is, rebelling againſt the law of the mind. Therefore may we thinke that the Accuſer was but (as S. Hierome ſpeaketh) Oculus ſinè pupilla, when he read the hereſie of Proculus, & miſtooke the ſtate of the queſtion.
                  5 Now the hereſie being thus, we couet to know firſt, when ſinne may be ſaid to reigne, and whether Proteſtants hold the hereticall opinion: in both which we can deſire no better Author to guie vs ſatisfaction, than is their now profeſſed Accuſer.

                     it is to be noted (ſaith their Ieſuite Ribera) that by ſinne the Apoſtle vnderſtandeth concupiſcence, calling it ſo with an article, 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , that is, The ſin, a note of ſingularitie. The words then are not hereticall, but Apoſtolicall. We come to the ſence.
                  8 Sinne is taken either materially, or formally; the Romaniſts hold concupiſcence to be ſinne in the * firſt meaning, becauſe it is not voluntarie: the Proteſtants hold the ſecond, becauſe it is ſtill a tranſgreſſion of a commandement. Which is thus proued, firſt by reaſon: Fatemur concupiſcentiam eſſe quandam iniquitatem, & obliquitatem, non ſolùm contra dominatum nientis, ſed etiam contra legem Dei. Stapleton. l. 3. de Iuſtificat. cap. 2. 
                     We confeſſe (ſaith M. Stapleton) that concupiſcence is a kind of iniquitie and obliquitie, not onely againſt the donanion of the mind, but alſo againſt the law of God. Well then, the proper definition of ſinne being this, A tranſgreſsion of Gods law, how ſhal we conceine that it is no ſia? Againe it was (they grant) formally a ſinne in man vnregenerate: but why? becauſe of the commandement, Thou ſhalt not luſt: then muſt it be ſinne in the regenerate, becauſe the commandement continueth the ſame. Therefore cannot this Ethiope (concupiſcence) poſſibly change her colour, but muſt be formally a ſinne: for ſinne euen in an vnregenerate man may be ſometimes vnuoluntarie.

                        c. pag. 4. Caſſander doth endeuour to determine this point: who conſidering concupiſcence as it is contradictorie vnto the ſpirit of the mind, thinketh, that with S. Auguſtine, we may call it a ſinne: but if we conſider it in reſpect of the offence of God, and guilt which is ſubiect vnto damnation, then (ſaith he) is it not a ſinne in the regenerate; which determination we do allow but in part.
                  10 In briefe▪ our concluſion is, that concupiſcence, in reſpect of it owne nature, is a ſinne: but in reſpect of the perſon, (who is a partie regenerate, in whom the guilt is pardoned) it is as no ſinne. Which Tenet of all Proteſtants was held by ſome of their owne notable Diuines, ſaying, Eſt communis ſententia apud Sectarios (meaning Proteſtants) concupiſcentiam poſt iuſtificatiouem eſſe verè acpropriè peccatum, quamuis credentibus non imputetur.

                     Concupiſcence remaineth a ſinne in the regenerate, although not imputed vnto him. Well then, that hereſie which Proclus taught, the Proteſtants hold not, and that which the Proteſtants hold is no hereſie.

But Caluine doth not ſcorne the Scriptures of the old Teſtament, with the Manichees, but profeſſedly Manichaei reiecto veteri Teſtamento Legem & Prophetas ludibrio habentes, Deum crudelitatis & nimij rigoris accuſabant. &c Where he condemneth them and the Libertines.

                  The Arians taught, that the Son is inferior vnto the Father: ſo do the Tritheits at this day.
               
               
                  
                  THE PROTESTANTS APPEALE: By the teſtimonie of their Aduerſaries.

                        SO do the Tritheits: true; but what is that vnto Proteſtants, as vnto Luther, Caluine, and Melancthon,

                     who (as witneſſeth their Aduerſarie) impugned thoſe Tritheits? Therefore might the accuſer haue kept the Tritheits out of his Catalogue of hereſies, framed by him purpoſely againſt Proteſtants, ſeeing that the Tritheits were no more Proteſtants, than the Romaniſts are Tritheits. Is it not ſo?

                        Therefore do we iuſtly reckon Caluine among thoſe heretikes, who denied the Diuinitie of Chriſt:

                  SECT. 2.
                  2 Thus haue Bellarmine, Valentia, Armandus, Poſſeuinus, foure Ieſuites, charged Caluine with blaſphemy; and can he poſſibly eſcape? At ſi Pater eſt per excellentiā Deus, quomodo non eſt maior Filio? Bellar. quo ſuprà.
                      
                     For if the Father be by excellency God, how is he greater than the Sonne? This is the maine and onely obiection, which his accuſer doth enforce: this once aſſoyled, Caluine muſt be immediatly abſolued.

                     Some (ſaith he) by occaſion of that ſaying of Chriſt, [Iohn. 14.

Which expoſition hath bene followed by famous Doctors, as namely, Athanaſius, Baſil, Gregory Nazianzene, Hilary, Origen, Epiphanius, Cyrill, Leontius, Theophylact, Euthymius.

                  3 So that ſentence of the heretikes called the Tritheits, and of the Fathers being the ſame, in words, viz. The Father is by an excellencie God; but contradictorie in ſence: Caluine muſt neceſſarily be acknowledged to haue followed the interpretation of the orthodoxall Fathers, who haue bene confeſſed by the Accuſer himſelfe to haue 
                        Sea aboue §. 1. letter, b. 
                     impugned thoſe heretikes, whom he calleth the Tritheits. What greater dignitie could our Aduerſaries haue done vnto the memorie of Caluine, than by thus ſending foure Ieſuits to accuſe his ſpeech of excellencie of the Father: and by and by to bring in twelue Fathers to acquit him, among whom, if they will, they may make Pope Clement the chiefe of that inqueſt?

                  SECT. 1.
                  
                     GAbriel Prateolus a Pariſian Diuine, in his booke profeſſedly written for the diſcouerie of ancient hereſies, interpreteth the meaning of S. Auguſtine, in cenſuring Iouiniā
                      to haue taught, that Diuus quoque Auguſtinus lib. de haereſ. illi impingit, quòd dixerit B. Dei genitricē fuiſſe a viro ſuo Ioſeph carnaliter cognitam poſt Chriſtum natū: quod tamen illi non aſcribit B. Hieronymus, qui contra eum duo
                           •
                         libros cō
                        poſuit. Prateolus de ſect. & dogm. hereſ. lib. 9. De Iouinianis. num 6. pag. 241. So that the pariendo corruptam, vſed by S. Auguſtine, he interpreteth of a pariendo, which ſuppoſeth cognoſcere virum, per coitum virilem: which indeed onely doth corrupt virginitie. This was the error of Heluidius; whether of Iouinian, or no, Prateolus ſeemeth to doubt, becauſe Hierome writing two bookes againſt Iouinian, would not haue paſſed ſuch a blot as this.
                      
                     the bleſſed Virgin after the birth of Chriſt was knowne of Ioſeph. The accuſation then lieth thus: Proteſtants for ſaying that the bleſſed Virgine bare Chriſt our Sauiour, after the manner of women, aperiendo vuluam, do therefore teach that the bleſſed Virgine after the birth of Chriſt, did know her husband Ioſeph after the manner of a wife, and bare other children; which was the hereſie (ſay they) of Iouinian, doubtleſſe of 
                        Auguſt. Tom. 6. haereſ. 84. From this hereſie their Coccius freeth Luther with a non probat, &c. and chargeth no Proteſtant with it. Coccius Theſaur. Tom. 1. lib. 8. art. 3. 
                     Heluidius. We need not exemplifie the cruditie of this kinde of Logicke.
                  2 Yet are they loath that Proteſtants ſhould thus eſcape, whom they therefore condemne for ſaying, that the bleſſed Virgine did in bearing Chriſt vuluam aperire, which the Romaniſts will haue all one with virginitatem corrumpere; and therefore with a loud ſhoot crie out vpon Proteſtants as vpon curſed heretikes: notwithſtanding that Proteſtants were directed in the phraſe by the holy Ghoſt: 
                        Luc. 2. 23. according to the Rhemiſh tranſlation.
                      
                     They caried him vnto Ieruſalem to preſent him vnto the Lord, as it is written in the law, Euery male opening the matrice, ſhall be called holy vnto the Lord. Whereupon it is that diuerſe Fathers, to wit, Theophylact, Ambroſe, and Origen, did not doubt to ſay, that Alij, contrà hanc legem proprié ad Chriſtum pertinuiſſe aſſerunt, eò quòd ipſe ſolus aperuit vuluam matris ſuae, cum alijs aperiat vir vterum, quae eſt ſententia Theophylacti ſuper hoc loco: ſimiliter & Ambrofij ſi

                     Chriſt was that immaculate one, who alone (without the preceding act of man) matris ſuae vuluam aperuit; as witneſſeth their owne Biſhop Ianſenius. Therefore the aſſertion of Proteſtants, as yet, appeareth to be Propheticall and Euangelicall.
                  3 If now the accuſers ſhall no longer vrge the act, but the maner thereof, which ſome Proteſtants haue deſcribed, to be after the manner of childbirth, Claustra virginalis vuluae reſerare: this manner is indeed denied by ſome Fathers, but not by all, nor yet by any as hereticall, as though it implied any proper corruption of virginitie. For their elder B. Rhenanus

Hoc diſerte docent Bucerus & Calumus. Why? Solùm in filijs fidelium negant peccatum originale, quos dicunt ſanctos naſci. & ſaluari etiam ſine Baptiſmo. Bellar. l. 4. c. 9. de notis, §. 14. Pelagiani. Pelagianam haereſin Calumus renouat, cùm &c. Lindanus Panopl. lib. 4. cap. 15. 
                  The Pelagians ſaid, that there is no originall ſinne in men, eſpecially in the children of the faithfull: which is the doctrine of Bucer and Caluine.
               
               
                  THE PROTESTANTS APPEALE: By the teſtimonies of their Romiſh Aduerſaries.
                  
                  SECT. 1.
                  CArdinall Bellarmine, and Lindane, two of the greateſt Panopliſts and armorers that the Church of Rome hath had, are both bent againſt Proteſtants, to bring them within the compaſſe of a damnable hereſie: but what? Caluine (ſay they) teacheth, that there is no originall ſinne, eſpecially
                     
                     in the children of the faithfull: ſo they. But their Gregory de Valentia, a Ieſuite, and a publike Reader in their Schooles, contrarily affirmeth, that Lutherus & Caluinus, & caeteri nouatores adeò non negauerunt peccatum originale, vt magna etiam contentione illud aſſerant, & prodigioſis etiā loquendi formulis, neque minus falſis ac impijs, illud ſupra modum exaggerauerint. Greg. Valent. Ieſ. de orig. pecc. c. 2. initio.
                      
                     Luther, Caluine, and other Nouellers (ſo he calleth them) are ſo farre from the denying of Originall ſinne, that they vehemently and with prodigious maner of ſpeech do falſely and impiouſly exaggerate it aboue meaſure. Vnto him we adioyne their Ieſuite Vaſquez, who likewiſe inueigheth againſt Caluine and Luther, for Alter error eſt aliorum noſtri temporis, qui affirmant eſſentiam peccati originalis eſſe concupiſcentiā, & fomitem qui nos ad malum inclinat.—Ita expreſſè tradiderunt Lutherani,—& Caluinus. Quare in confeſſione Auguſtana hoc peccatum appellârunt maximum. Vaſquez Ieſan Thom. tom. 1. diſp. 132. cap. 1. num. 2. 
                     affirming concupiſcence to be a part of Originall ſinne, and the greateſt of ſinnes.
                  
                  2 Here is a counterpoiſe of their owne witneſſes: two of them ſay, that Proteſtants do denie that there is any Originall ſinne in children vnbaptized: two other ſay, that they affirme, that there is originall ſinne in all, yea in the parties baptized. Both theſe kind of witneſſes conſpire againſt Proteſtants to proue them heretikes, as did the Elders to proue Suzanna an adultereſſe: but when we (as Daniel teacheth) put the witneſſes aſunder, then is their falſhood found out by their contrarietie, which is more than that of the forenamed Elders: for theſe two aſſertions, Proteſtants denie originall ſinne, and Proteſtants do not denie originall ſinne, but do rather too extremely affirme it, fall vpon that text, 
                        Marc. 14. 56. 
                     They bare falſe witneſſe, and their teſtimonies agree not.
                  
               
               
                  A further iuſtification of Proteſtants: by the confeſsion of their Aduerſaries.
                  SECT. 2.
                  3 May not Proteſtants be abſolued by that which hath bene now confeſſed? O no, for either they denie originall ſinne, and ſo are they no better than Pelagian heretikes; or elſe they do too much affirme and exaggerate it, and thus are they falſe and impious Nouellers. Whether therefore thus, or ſo, Proteſtants muſt be condemned for a doctrine concerning originall ſinne: be this for an old or new error it skilleth not, it is decreed they muſt be condemned.
                  4 Seuere Iudges, and precipitate: for the doctrine of Proteſtants concerning the nature of originall ſinne hath receiued a better approbation by their owne extreme Aduerſarie. For Ecchius (whom the Romaniſts haue named the 
                        See the Catalogue in the beginning of this Appeale, at the word Ecchius. 
                     onely challenger of his time, for defence of the Catholike faith) did in his diſputation holden at Wormes, acknowledge, that Ex hac explicatione magis apparet notio peccati originis, quod in carentia illius originalis iuſtitiae conſiſtit, addita vitioſa concupiſcentia, quae legi mentis repugnat, & ad illicitos motus & actus perpetuò inclinat. Haec itaque definitio peccati originis doctrinae veterum & recentiorum magis eſt conſentanea. Sed de hoc articulo agnoſcit ipſe Ecchius, nullam eſſe controuerſiā, vt qui Colloquio Wormatienſi planè conciliatus, & concordatus fuerit▪ in hanc, quam diximus, ſententiam. Caſſander Conſult. art. 2. de pecc orig. pag. 3. 
                     in the article concerning the nature of originall ſinne, there was no difference betweene him and his Aduerſaries. But more plainely Vega (who is extolled by Caniſius their Ieſuite for one of the 
                        See the Catalogue at the word Vega. 
                     principall Diuines who were preſent at the Councell of Trent:) 
                     Et probauit haec ſancta ſynodus, & confirmauit per omnia, vtrumque iſtorum Canonum in decreto de pecc. originali. Et in hac tota doctrina nihil, quod ſciam, à nobis diſſentiunt Lutherani. Conſtanter vbique & ſatis nobiſcum conſentaneè illam docent Proteſtantes in ſuis confeſſionibus, apologijs, & libellis alijs. Damnati verò ſunt in hac Patrum definitione Pelagiani, Armeni, Albanenſes & alij, ſi qui fuerunt, qui negârunt peccatum originale. Vega de natura & legis imbecill. lib. 2. cap. 6. §. Et probauit. 
                     The Lutheranes (ſaith he) do not differ from vs (ſo farre as I know) in any point concerning
                     
                     the doctrine of originall ſinne: but the Proteſtants do teach in their confeſsions, Apologies and other bookes, the doctrine of originall ſinne constantly and Conſonantly with vs: but thoſe who were condemned in the Councell of Trent, were the Pelagians, and Armenians, and Albanenſes, and all others who denied originall ſinne. Who now ſeeth not the prauitie of theſe Accuſers? whom it might haue become to paſſe by the Proteſtants maner of exaggeration of originall ſinne, in making it the greateſt ſinne; and rather to haue controlled ſome of their owne men for diminution, in making it the Taperus tom. 1. pag. 36. dixit pecca

                     THE NEXT ROMISH ACCVSATION Of Pelagianiſme; concerning the nature of all ſinne; and whether euery ſinne be in it ſelfe mortall or no.
                     
                     
                        Secundò Pelagiani dicuot omne peccatū eſſe mortale: ita refert D. Hieron. l. 2. contra Pelag. Bellarm. cap. 9. de notis. §. 14. Pelagiani. Hunc errorem docent omnes Sectarij, Lutherus, Caluinus, &c. Ibid.
                         
                        The Pelagians ſay, that euery ſinne is mortall, as S. Hierome relateth: And this is the error of all Proteſtants.
                     
                  
               
               
                  THE PROTESTANTS APPEALE: According to the teſtimonies of their Romiſh Aduerſaries.
                  
                  SECT. 3.
                  5 In the place of S. Hierome, (the onely witneſſe brought in to proue the Pelagians guiltie of an hereſie, in this article) there appeareth nothing to that purpoſe. S. Auguſtine, who is called Malleus haereticorum, that is, the Mallet againſt heretikes, beateth the Pelagians vnto duſt, yet neuer layeth he any ſuch thing to their charge. Nay their owne Romiſh relators of hereſies, namely Alphonſ. haereſ.

                     Prateolus, with thoſe whom this later citeth, as Lindane, Staphylus and Hoſius, in the diſcouering of the Pelagian doctrine, and all deſtinately bent to intitle Proteſtants in any hereſie, haue bene in this point altogether ſilent: which we take to be a ſufficient conuiction of our Accuſer, for feining an old hereſy. And that it is alſo no hereſie, but an orthodoxal truth, moſt of their owne Authors haue See aboue. alreadie auouched. According to our promiſe we returne vnto
               
               
                  
                     The Romiſh application of the distinction of mortall and veniall ſinnes, confuted.
                  
                  SECT. 4.
                  6 Seeing that the Romaniſts will be called Catholikes, in confeſſing that no man can liue without ſinne in this life, how ſhall they brand Proteſtants with the name of heretikes, for ſaying that it is impoſsible to keepe the law? The onely anſwer that their D.

                     marke diligently, is, that none can fulfill the law of God without veniall ſinnes. Then ſay we, they muſt confeſſe together with Proteſtants, an impoſsibilitie of an abſolute performance of the law. No, ſaith their Cardinall: Et quia quod non eſt perfectè voluntarium, hoc ipſo etiam non eſt perfectè contra legem, niſi materialiter: proptereà rect

                     Becauſe veniniall ſinnes are not perfectly voluntarie, therefore are they but onely praeter legem, beſides the law, and not formally contra legem, contrary vnto the law. Confeſſing that if that which they call veniall ſinne, be by nature properly mortall, then the offending in one veniall doth make a man guiltie of tranſgreſsion of the whole law: and conſequently doth inferre an impoſsibilitie of keeping the law.
                  7 Wherefore it concerneth vs onely to proue that the veniall ſinne is not praeter, beſides, but euen contrà, contrarie vnto the law of God: if yet we neede proue that which their owne Doctors confeſſe, as namely their Ieſuite Dicendum verò eſt, vt docuerunt Durandus, Caietanus, Vega; Veniale peccatum eſſe quidem contra legem.

                      Vega (who liued in the time of the Councell of Trent, and was an actor therein) called the more common iudgement of the Schoole-men. And it ſtandeth vpon an inuincible reaſon, which their Ieſuite Valentia acknowledgeth, to wit; Nam vbi lex non eſt, neque praeuaricatio legis, inquit Apoſtolus. Et id o Dauid praeuaricantes reputauit omnes peccatores terrae, quoniam ne intelligi quidem peccatū poteſt, quod non ſit legis alicuius tran

                     No man can conceiue of ſinne, but as it is a tranſgreſsion of the law. And can there be a proper tranſgreſſion of a law, which is not formally contrary vnto the law? Therefore doth their Vega wiſh men to Et decet vbique vt noſtros ſermone, & Scripturis, & ſanctorū Patrum verbis attemperemus. Idque vt faciamus, imprimis ſtatuendum eſt, peccata venialia eſſe proprie & ſimpliciter peccata. Sunt namque actus mali ſimpliciter, quippe qui voluntarij, & circa materiam indebitam, & à recta

                     frame their ſpeeches according vnto Scriptures, and the words of ancient Fathers, by accounting veniall ſinnes properly and abſolutely ſinnes ſimply euill, becauſe they are voluntarie, and do certainly diſpleaſe God. VVhich diuerſe others our learned Aduerſaries haue See aboue. confeſſed to be (although by the mercie of God veniall) yet in their owne nature mortall.
                  
                  8 So now this their onely refuge, in diſtinguiſhing veniall and mortall, by praeter and contrà, like Ionas his gourd, is periſhed by the ſhine of the confeſſed truth, and conſequently the article of the Proteſtants is eſtabliſhed. For if none (as all confeſſe) can liue without ſinne, and that euery ſinne is a formall tranſgreſſion of Gods law, and euery tranſgreſſion morall is in nature mortal, then cannot any poſſibly be an abſolute fulfiller of the law of God. Which leſſon our Aduerſaries may partly learne frō the ſhauē beards of their Prieſts, wherein they will haue vs to obſeruea morall ſignification, to wit: R

To conclude, the Romaniſts in diſcerning of venials, do reſolue, that the Si docti dubitant de aliquo, ſecurior pars in conſcientia eſt eligenda: ſecurior áutem pars eſt, agnoſcere culpam, vbi non eſt.

                     with the Neſtorians, who did moſt obstinately affirme, that the Diuinitie of Chriſt did not ſuffer. All theſe three who haue bene accuſed of the hereſie of the Neſtorians, do renounce & condemne their opinion as the doctrine of phrenticke and obſtinate heretikes. Wherefore we appeale to the conſcience of any man, to iudge whether the forcing of obſcure ſentences of men ſhould preponderate in iudgement, and preuaile againſt their plaine proteſtations; and whether ſuch Accuſers might not by thus doing iuſtifie them, who accuſed that iuſt one for ſaying, 
                        Matth. 26. 61. 
                     I can destroy the temple, which they interpreted of the temple of ſtone, but he meant of the temple of his bodie? Yet is not Luther fully acquitted, we therefore exhibite
               
               
                  
                     A iuſtification of Luther in the point of Eutychianiſme, by the teſtimonie of his Romiſh Aduerſaries.
                  
                  SECT. 2.
                  4 The Neſtorians and Eutychians were as oppoſite as Eaſt and Weſt, the latter confounding the diſtinct natures of Chriſt, which the Neſtoriās diſtracted: yet hath the Accuſer condemned Luther both for a Neſtorian, and an Eutychian: not vnlike the man, who being asked where the wind ſtood, anſwered, Eaſt and by Weſt. But Luther hath alreadie freed himſelfe from Neſtorianiſme.

Sed certiſſimum eſt, Vigilium diuinitatem pro Deo ipſo dixiſſe
                           •
                         quia ea quidem ratione impaſſibiliter paſſus eſſe dici poteſt, quia cum idem paſſus ſit carne & humanitate, nihil tamen aut paſſus eſt, aut pati potuit diuinitate, Greg. Valent. lib. 2 contra Vbiquit. cap. 1. §. At inquis. 
                     both Cyrill and Pope Vigilius, who were orthodoxall writers, affirmed (ſaith their Ieſuit Valentia,) Diuinitas Christi paſſa est, that is, The Diuinity of Chriſt ſuffred impaſsibly, being nailed vnto the Croſſe: but it is certaine (ſaith he) that Vigilius by Diuinitie, or godhead, did meane God. So likewiſe where S. Auguſtine doubted not to ſay, that the diuine nature was borne of the humane nature, their Ieſuite Suarez eaſily diſcerneth a diuine truth in the ſpeech, ſaying that Dicit Auguſtinus, Natura aeterna atque diuina, non naſcitur ex humana natura, niſi ſecundum veritatem naturae humanae [ex quo effici videtur, diuinam naturam concipi:] Reſpondeo, proptèr identitatem, quae in diuinis eſt inter naturam & hypoſtaſin, quandoque natura ponitur pro perſona, vel hypoſtaſi. Et ſecundùm hoc dicit Auguſtinus: Naturam diuinam eſſe conceptam, & natam, quia ſeil perſona Filij eſt concepta & nata ſecundùm humanam naturam. Aquinas part. 3. q. 35. art. 1. Meritò dicit Thomas, eſſe hanc improptiam loquutionem, & piè explicandam. Suarez in eum locum Thomae, Tom. 2. 
                     S. Auguſtine reſpecting the Identitie, which there is betweene the nature and the perſon of Christ, putting the nature in ſtead of the perſon, did ſay that the diuine nature was conceiued and borne: which Aquinas called an improper ſpeech. Marke we now what a diſtorted creature an irregular affection is: Auguſtine ſaid, The diuine nature was conceiued: Luther ſaid, The Diuinitie was borne of the Virgine: both ſpeeches are equiualent, and the one is fauoured, by taking it for an improper ſpeech, the other is condemned as ſauouring of a grand hereſie. Againe, Luther ſaid, Diuinitatem pati, and their owne Pope Vigilius ſaid, Diuinitas paſſa eſt; the phraſes are all one, and yet lo Vigilius was therein an Orthodoxe, and Luther is a damned heretike.

                  9 Thirdly, ſuppoſing (for he might foreſee the former anſwer would be thought too harſh) that the Synod of Conſtantinople had expreſly by name condemned Honorius; he doubteth not to tel vs, that the Quodſi aliquis adhuc non poſſit adduci, vt credat corruptam eſſe 6. Synodum, is accipiat alteram ſolutionem, quae eſt Iohannis à Turrecremata, lib. 2. de Eccleſ. cap. 93 qui docet Patres 6. Synodi damnaſſe quidem Honorium, ſed ex falſa informatione, ac proinde in eo iudicio errâſſe. Quamuis enim generale Concilium legitimum non poſſit errare, vt neque errauit hoc 6. in dogmatibus fidei definiendis: tamen errare poteſt in quaeſtionibus de facto. Bellarm. lib. 4 de Pont. cap. 11. §. Quodſi. 
                     Synode erred not in a matter of faith (ſaith he) but in a matter of fact. But herein he remembreth not the Acts or Epiſtles of Honorius, wherby the Councel was induced to pronoūce him an heretike, & forgetteth alſo his owne aſſertion (which will teach him to recant this anſwer) wherin he ſaid, If 
                        Ob. Caiaphas condemnauit Chriſtum.—Alij Catholici reſpondent, quaeſtionem tantùm de facto fuiſſe, non de iure, viz. an Chriſtus eſſet necandus. At quaeſtio illa, etiamſi de facto eſſet, tamen quaeſtionem de fide grauiſſ. inuoluebat, an Chriſtus eſſet verus Meſſias. Bellar l. 2. de Conc. c. 8. §. Proponunt 2. 
                     in the Iewes proceeding againſt Chriſt, the queſtion of fact, (viz. whether Christ were to be put to death) did containe in it a queſtion of faith, to wit, whether Chriſt was the Meſsias or no; why muſt it not then likewiſe follow, that this matter of fact, in condemning Pope Honorius of hereſie, did compriſe in it this concluſion: Ergo, the Pope of Rome may become an heretike, (as well as Sergius, or Macarius, or any other of the Monothelites, who together with him were therefore condēned?) and conſequently it contradicteth the now Article of the Romane faith.
                  10 If we aske why the graue Biſhops of ſo famous a Councell ſhould erre in that matter of fact, their Cardinall Baronius can readily and roundly anſwer vs, that the Councell Certè quidem Honorij epiſtola prius diſqui

Ceaſſe (good Reader) to maruell at this boldneſſe, conſidering who it is that anſwereth thus, and for whom; a Cardinall for a Pope: otherwiſe the anſwer way ſeeme more than ſtrange: except we ſhall thinke this one Cardinall, who now many hundred yeares after handleth this cauſe, to be better ſeene in the matter, than were the foreſaid three hundred and fiftie Biſhops, who liued at the ſame time, and tooke

                  11 In the third place is produced the ſeuenth generall Councell, pronouncing Honorius an Anathema: but their Cardinall Bellarmine doth quickly diſpatch vs an anſwer:

                     This Councell was deceiued (ſaith he) by the preſidence of the former Councell. That is to ſay (if it be truly interpreted,) the Fathers of this Councel did attribute more credit vnto the ſixt Councel of Conſtantinople, than the now Cardinall will do.

The ſumme of the Cardinals anſwer is, that the Legates of the Pope choſe rather that Pope Honorius ſhould be condēned, than that they would diſturbe the proceeding of the Councell againſt Sergius, and other heretikes; who would not willingly haue yeelded vnto the ſentence of the Synode, except Honorius, who was accuſed of the ſame hereſie, had together with them bene likewiſe condemned. In the which anſwer the Cardinall hath excelled himſelfe, accounting it a Romiſh policie in ſome caſe to ſatisfie guiltie perſons, by condernning an innocent. Which anſwer is, for iniquitie wonderfull, but much more for the incongruitie thereof, eſpecially ſeeing that it proceedeth of that Schoole and prefeſsion, which had rather all other Churches ſhould be thought guilty in condemning, than to acknowledge one Pope (whom they make the vniuerſall head of the Church) worthy to be condemned.

                  16 Let our Aduerſaries pleade for their Pope Celeſtine the third, who (anno 1191) is knowne by his decree to haue diſſolued the Celeſtinum 3.

Eſſe autem hanc Celeſtini ſententiam haereticam, planum eſt, tum quia contrarium docuit Innocentius 3. Cap. Quanto, de diuortijs, tum etiam quia idem definitum eſt in Conc. Tridentino, Seſſ. 24. Can. 5.— 
                     matrimonie of a partie relapſing into hereſie: for albeit they anſwer, that Reſpondeo, nec Celeſtinum nec Innocentium aliquid de ea re certi ſtatuiſſe, ſed vtrumque reſpondiſſe, quod ſibi probabilius videbatur.—Epiſtolam Celeſtini fuiſſe aliquando inter epiſtolas Decretales, verum quidem eſt, ſed non poteſtinde colligi, factum eſſe à Celeſtino Decretum planè Apoſtolicum, & ex Cathedra, cùm conſtet, multa eſſe alia in epiſtolis Decretalibus, quae non faciunt rem aliquam eſſe de fide, ſed ſolùm opiniones Pontificum de ea re nobis declarant. Bellar. l. 4. de Rom. Pont. c. 14. §. Triceſimus tertius. 
                     although this his ſentence were ſometime regiſtred among the decretall Epiſtles of Popes, yet was this not a decree Apoſtolicall, and proceeding out of the chaire. Notwithſtanding we know that their owne Popes haue thought, that nothing can be held to be deliuered

more E Cathedra, than are ſuch their publike decrees: commaunding Innocentius:—Ita noſtra declaratione cuſtodiri mandamus, vt ſi quis in illa commiſerit, veniam ſibi denegari nouerit deinceps. Dicendo verò omnia Decretalia conſtituta, nullū de decretalibus conſtitutis praetermiſit, quod non mandauerit eſſe cuſtodiendum.

But with what inſolidity this is performed, we haue partly ſhewne, and now do more plainely demonſtrate, by examining both the poſition of the Inuiſibility of the Church, and alſo the Application thereof.
                  3 Nothing ſeemeth vnto our Aduerſaries to be more preiudiciall vnto the profeſſion of Proteſtants, than is the terme of viſibility of the Church, wherein the Romaniſts do place a demonſtratiue note of a true Church, requiring that the Church hath

                  11 After a ſort, and in ſome manner, are termes indefinite, and haue no certaine latitude; how farre the Author did extend them, we know not; how farre he did not extend them, he himſelfe doth ſhew, where (in the ſame Treatiſe) he concludeth, that the Romaniſts are no ſound members of the Catholike Church, both becauſe (ſaith he) they go directly cōtrary vnto the Chriſtiā faith, and alſo becauſe they do vehemently impugne the reuealed truth, and perſecute the profeſſors thereof. Therefore the taking of theſe termes of this our Author, [after a ſort] and [In a manner the profeſsion of the faith] which are but inches, and the ſtretching of them vnto ſo long an ell, as to be the [plainly & euidently confeſsing, that the Romane Church profeſſeth the ſame faith (

                        Rom. 3. 2. 
                     Oracles of God, and who caried his commandements in the 
                        Matth 23. 5. 
                     Phylacteries and fringes of their garments) did profeſſe the faith of their fore-fathers in ſome ſort, and in ſome manner; when as yet by the 
                        Matth 16. 6. 
                     leauen of their Doctors (the Phariſees) the 
                        Matth. 15. 3. 
                     commandements of God were tranſgreſſed through their Traditions. So if we ſhould not acknowledge Gods holy prouidence, (as in the Greeke) ſo in the Romane Church, & ſome ſort of profeſsion of the ancient faith, by whom haue bene preſerued the lawes of the commandements, containing the ſumme of morall obedience; the Symboll and Creede Apoſtolicall, which hold the ſumme of the fundamentall Articles of faith; the two Sacraments, Baptiſme & Euchariſt, which are the ſacred ſeales of Gods promiſes; and the Scriptures of the old and new Teſtament, in their firſt originals of Hebrew and Greeke, being the euidences of our heauenly Fathers will, and containing in them all truth neceſſarie vnto ſaluation: we might be worthily iudged both impiouſly vnthākful vnto God, & enuiouſly malicious againſt that Church.

They might haue gratified vs verie much to haue popounded ſome one controuerſie, wherein we might haue inſiſted: which taske we neither could nor would haue refuſed: but now in ſuch a multitude of examples, wherewith we ſuperabound, onely copia nocet; for our firſt difficultie is, where to begin, and the next, when to make an end. Neuertheleſſe ſeeing the matter is left vnto our choiſe, it may not offend them, if we imitate Moſes in his hiſtorie, who ſaid, In the beginning God created, &c. and S.

                  6 Fourthly, if the left hand of temporall power be thus cut off, what is the vertue of his ſpirituall iuriſdiction? Is his iudgement and ſentence infallible? This they pretend, and ob. Matth. 23. [They (the Phariſees) ſit in Moſes chaire, all things that they ſhall ſay, do.]

                     This is a detorted ſence, for Chriſt did not vnderſtand by Moſes chaire the doctrine of the Prieſts, but the law of Moſes; neither were they to be obeyed further than that they taught according to that law. But it may be they could not but ſpeake law, for Ob. Ioh. 11. 51. [This ſaid Caiphas, being high Priest that ſame yeare.]

Whatſoeuer iudgements are deliuered by the Popes of Rome, in the behalfe of the whole Church, do proceed from the ſpirit of God, becauſe the Popes do viter them; for it is manifeſt that Caiphas deliuered a true iudgement.

                  9 Neither is there almoſt any one text in the whole Bible, of Canonicall Scriptures, from Geneſis vnto the Apocalypſe, alledged vſually by the Romaniſts in the defence of any Article of the Romiſh profeſſion, which (in an anſwer vnto the Apologiſts Conteſt) we dare not proteſt to be otherwiſe expounded, according vnto the ſence of Proteſtants, euen by their Romiſh Aduerſaries: which we deliuer vpon a grounded experience. And if this may be performed, our Reader muſt ſuſpect, that the matter is not caried of Proteſtants by any miſerable begging, but rather of theſe Romaniſts by a cunning ſtealing of the matter in queſtion. This point by them thus ended, the Apologiſts ſeeme to ſound vp a triumph.

Vpon which preſumption (we ſee) they haue pronounced vpon Proteſtants a certaine ouerthrow. But whileſt as they are making their proclamation, behold a crie of their owne men of warre, panting in deſpaire of victorie, as men guilty vnto themſelues of manifold Innouations, & confeſſing, that there is beleeued in the Church of Rome (when we vnclaſped the
