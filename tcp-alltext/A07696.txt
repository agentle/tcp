You be not ignorant good vncle, what heapes of heuines, hath of late fallen among vs alredy, with which some of our poore familie be fallen into such dumpes, that scantly can any such comfort as my poore wyt can geue them, anye thinge asswage

Then sende his people hither, and his false fayth therwith, so that such as here are & remayne styll, shall eyther bothe lese al and be lost too, or forced to forsake the faythe of oure Sauior Christe, and fal to the sect of Machomette. And yet which we more feare then all ye remnant, no smalle part of oure owne folke that dwel euen here aboute vs, are (as we feare) falling to him, or alreadye confedered with him: whych if it so bee, shal happelye keepe thys quarter frō the Turkes incursion: but then shall they that tourne to hys lawe leaue all theyr neighbours nothynge, but shall haue oure good geuen them, and oure bodyes bothe: but if we tourne as they do, and forsake oure Sauioure to, and then (for there is no borne Turke so cruel to Christen folke, as is the false Christen that falleth from the fayth) wee shall stande in perell (if wee parseuer in ye trueth) to bee more hardely handled, and dye more cruel death by oure owne countrey men at home, then if we were taken hence and caried into Turkye

What should I speake of the noble strong citie of the Rhodes, ye winning wherof he counted as a victorie against ye whole corps of christendom, sith al christendom was not able to defend that strong town against him: howbeit if the princes of christendome euerye where aboute, woulde where as nede was, haue set to their handes in tyme: the Turke had neuer taken anie one place of al those places, but partly dissencions fallen among our selfe,

partly yt no mā careth what harme other folke fele: but eche part suffreth other to shift for it self. The Turke is in few yeres wonderfully ēcreased, & christēdom on ye other side very sore decayed: and al this worketh our wickednes wt which god is not cōtent. But now where as you desire of me, some plētie of cōfortable thinges, which ye may put in remēbrance: & comfort therwith your company, verely in ye rehersing & heaping of your manifold feares, my self begā to fele that there should much nede against so many troubles

And after I bethought me then vpon the Turke again. And first me thought his terrour nothing, whē I compared with it the ioyful hope of heauen.

               ¶The first Chapter, That the comfortes deuised by the olde paynem Philosophers vvere vnsufficient, and the cause vvherefore.
               FIrst shal you good Cosin vnderstand thys, yt the natural wise men of this worlde, the olde morall Philosophers, laboured muche in this matter, & many natural reasōs haue they written, wherby they myght encorage mē to set litle by such goodes or such hurtes eyther, the goyng or the cōmyng wherof, are the matter & the cause of tribulaciō, as are goodes of fortune, riches, fauor, frendes, fame, worldly worship, & such other thinges: or of the bodie, as beawty, strēgth, agilite quicknes, and health. These thinges (ye wote wel) cō
                  myng to vs, are matter of worldly welth: and takē frō vs by fortune, or by force, or by feare of th

                   losyng, bee matter of aduersite and tribulacyon
                     •
                   For tribulacyon semeth generallye, to signifye nothing els but some kind of grief, either paine of the body, or heauynes of the mind. Now the body not to fele that if feleth, al the wit in the world can not bring about, but yt the minde should not be grieued neither with the paine that the body feleth, nor with occasions of heauines offered & geuen vnto the soule it self. Thys thyng laboured the Philosophers very much about, and many goodly sayinges haue thei toward the strēgth & coūfort against tribulacion, excityng men to the full contempte of all

worldly losse, and dispising of sycknes, and al bodelye griefe, paynefull death and all. Howe bee it in verye dede, for any thyng that euer I read in them, I neuer could yet find that euer those natural reasons were able to geue sufficiēt comfort of them self: for they neuer stretche so farre but that they leaue vntouched for lacke of necessary knowledge, that special point which is not only the chief comfort of al: but without which also, al other comfortes are nothing, that is to wit, the referring the finall ende of theyr comforte vnto god, and to repute and take for the special cause of coūfort, that by the paciente sufferaunce of theyr tribulacion, they shall attayne his fauoure, and for theyr payne receyue rewarde at his hande in heauen. And for lacke of knowlage of this end
                     •
                   thei did (as they nedes must) leaue vntouched also the verye speciall meane, without which we can neuer attaine to this comforte, that is to wit, ye gracious ayde and helpe of God to moue, stirre, and guide vs foreward, in the referring all our ghos
                     •
                  ly comforte, yea and our worldly comforte too, al vnto that heauenly end. And therfore as I say, for the lacke of these thinges, all theyr comfortable coūsayles are veri farre vnsufficient: howe be it, though they be farre vnable to cure our dysease of them selfe, and therfore are not sufficiēt to be taken for our phisitiōs: some good drugges haue they yet in theyr shoppes for which they may be suffered to dwel among our Apoticaryes, if theyr medicines be not made of theyr owne braines, but after the billes made by the greate phisition God, prescribing the medicines him self, & correctyng ye faultes of theyr erronious receiptes: for without this way taken with them, they shall not fayle to do, as many bolde blind Apoticaries do: which eyther

for lucre or of a foolish pride, geue sycke folke medicines of theyr owne deuisyng, & therwith kil vp in corners many such simple folke, as they find so folish to put their liues in such lewde & vnlearned blynd bayardes handes. We shal therfore neyther fully receiue these philosophers reasons in this matter, nor ye
                     •
                   vtterly refuse thē: but vsing thē in such order as shalbe seme thē, the principal & theffectual medicines against these diseases of tribulaciō, shal we fetche frō yt highe great & excellent phisicion, without whō we could neuer be healed of our very deadly disease of damnaciō, for our necessitie wherin the spirit of god spirituallye speaketh of himself to vs, & biddeth vs of al our helth geue him ye honor: & therin thus sayth to vs. Honora medicum propter necessitatem enim ordinauit eum altissimus. Honor thou ye phisiciō, for him hath ye high god ordened for thi necessitie. Therfore let vs require ye high phisiciō, our blessed sauior Christ, whose holy manhed god ordened for our necessitie, to cure our deadly woundes, with ye medicine made of y• most holesom blud of his own blessed bodi: y• likewise as he cured by yt incōparable medicine our mortal malady, it may like him to send vs & put in our mīdes such medicines at this time, as agaīst y• sicknes & sorowes of tribulacions, may so cōfort & strēgth vs in his grace, as our deadly enemy ye deuil, maye neuer haue ye power by his poisoned dart of murmure, grudge and impacience, to turne our short sicknes of worldly tribulaciō, into ye endles euerlastyng death of infernal dānacion.
            
            
               ¶The seconde Chapter. That for a foundacion men must nedes begin vvith 
                     •
                  hyth.
               SYth al our principal cōfort must come of god, we must first presuppose in him to whō we shal with any gostly counsel geue ani effectual comforte, one grounde to begin withal: wherupon al y• we shall

build must be supported & stand, y• is to wit, the ground and foundacion of faith, without which had ready before, al the spiritual comfort that any man may speake of can neuer auaile a flye. For likewise as it were vtterly vaine to lay natural reasons of comfort, to hym that hath no wit, so wer it vndoubtedli frustrate to lay spiritual causes of comfort to him that hath no faith. For excepte a man first beleue, that holye sc
                     •
                  ipture is the worde of God, & that the worde of GOD is true, how can a mā take any comfort of that that the scripture telleth him therin? Nedes must the man take litle fruit of ye scripture, if he either beleue not that it wer the worde of God, or els wene that thoughe it were it might yet bee for all that vntrue. This faith as it is more fainte or more stronge, so shall the comfortable wordes of holy scripture stande the man in more stede or lesse. This vertue of faith, can nether any mā geue hymself nor yet any one man another: but though mē may with preachīg be ministers vnto god therin, & the man with his own frewyl obeying freely the inwarde inspiracion of god, be a weake worker with almightye god therin: yet is the faith in dede the gracious gyfte of god himself. For as Saint Iames sayth. Omne datum optimum & omne donum perfectum desursum est descendens a patre luminum Euery good gift and euery perfect gift, is geuen from aboue, descēding from the father of lightes. Therfore feling our faith by many tokens very faint, let vs pray to him that geueth it, that it may please him to helpe & encrease it. And let vs fyrst say with the man in ye gospell. Credo domine, adi
                        •
                     ua incredulitatem meam. I beeleue good Lorde but helpe thou the lacke of my belyefe. And after lette vs pray wyth the Apostles. Domine adauge nobis fidem. Lorde encrease oure fayth. And fynallye

let vs consider by Christes saying vnto them, that if we would not suffer the strength and feruour of our faith to waxe luke warme, or rather kaye colde, and in maner lese his vigor by scatering our mindes abrode aboute so many triflyng thinges, that of the matters of our faith, we very seldom thinke it that we woulde withdrawe our thought fro the respect and regarde of al worldly fantasies, and so gather our fayth together into a litle narrowe rowme. And lyke the lytle graine of a musterd sede, whiche is of nature hote, set it in the garden of our soule, al wedes pulled out for the better fedyng of our faith, than shall it growe, and so spreade vp in heighte, that the byrdes, that is to witte, the holy Aungels of heauen shall brede in our soule and bryng forth vertues in the braunches of our fayth, and then with the faithfull truste, that throughe the true beliefe of goddes worde we shal put in his promise, we shalbe wel able to commaunde a great mountaine of tribulacion, to voyde from the place where he stoode in our heart, where as with a very feble faith and a faint, we shalbe scāt hable to remoue a litle hillocke. And therefore, as for ye first conclusiō, as we must of necessitie before any spiritual coūfort presuppose the foundacion of faith: So sith no man can geue vs faith, but only god, let vs neuer cease to call vppon God therefore.

               ¶The thyrd Chapter, The fyrst comfort in tribulacion, may a man take in thys: VVhan he feleth in himselfe a desyre and longyng to be comforted by God.
               
                  I Will in my poore mynde assigne for the fyrst comfort, the desier and longing to be by God comforted, and not without some reason call I this the fyrste cause of comforte. For lyke as the cure of that person is in a maner desperate, that hath no will to be cured: so is the discomforte of that person desperate, yt desireth not his own cōforte.
               And here shal I note you two kyndes of folke that are in tribulacion and heauines. One sorte that will seke for no comfort, an other sorte that wil. And yet of those that will not, are there also two sortes. For fyrst one sort there are, that are so drowned in sorowe, that they fall into a careles deadlye dulnes.
               Regarding nothing, thinking almoste of nothyng, no more than if they laye in a letarge, with whiche it may so fall, that witte and remembraunce will weare away, and fall euen fayre from them. And this comfortles kinde of heauines in tribulacion, is the hyghest kinde of the deadlye sinne of slothe. An other sorte are there, that will seke for no comforte, nor yet none receiue, but are in their tribulacion (be it losse or sicknes) so testie, so fumishe, and so farre oute of all pacience, that it boteth no mā to speake to them, and these are in a maner with impaciēce, as furious as though they were in halfe a frenesie, and may with a custome of such facioned behauiour, fall in therto ful & whole. And thys kinde of heauines in tribulacion, is euen a mischieuous high braunche of the mortal sinne of yre.
               Than is there as I tolde you, an other kynde of folke, which faine woulde be comforted, and yet are

they of two sortes to. One sort are those, that in theyr sorowe seke for worldly comfort: and of them shall we now speake the lesse for the diuers occasions that we shal after haue, to touche thē in moe places than one. But this will I here saye, that I learned of Saynct Barnard. He that in tribulaciō turneth himselfe vnto worldly vanities, to geat hel
                     •
                  e & comfort by them: fareth lyke a man that in perill of drowning catcheth whatsoeuer cometh next to hand, and that holdeth he fast be it neuer so simple a sticke, but than that helpeth him not: for ye sticke he draweth downe vnder the water with him, & there lye they drowned bothe together.
               So surely if we custome our selfe to put our trust of coumfort in the delyte of these pieuishe worldelye thinges God shal for that foule fault suffre our tribulacion to growe so great, that all the pleasures of this worlde shall neuer beare vs vp, but all oure pieuishe pleasure shal in ye depth of tribulaciō drown with vs.
               The other sorte is I saye, of those that long and desyre to bee coumforted of GOD. And as I tolde you beefore, they haue an vndoubted greate cause of coumforte, euen in that poynte alone, that they considre themselfe to desyre and longe to bee by almyghtye God coumforted: Thys mynde of theyrs may wel be cause of great comfort vnto them for two great consideracions. The one is, that they see themselfe seeke for their coumfort where they cannot fayle to finde it. For God both can geue them comfort, and wil. He can for he is almightie: he wil, for he is al good
                     •
                   and hath himselfe promised, Petite et accipietis. Aske and ye shall haue. He that hathe fayth (as he must nedes haue that shal take comfort) cannot doubt but that God wil surely kepe his promise. And therfore hath he a greate

cause to be of good comfort, as I say, in that he cons
                     •
                  
                  dereth that he longeth to be comforted by hym, which his faith maketh him sure, wil not fayle to cōfort him.
               But here considre this that I speake here of hym that in tribulacion longeth to bee comforted by God: and it is he that referreth the maner of his cōfortyng to God, holding himselfe content, whether it be by the taking away or the minyshment of the tribulacion it self, or by the geuing him pacience and spiritual consolacion therein. For of hym that onelye longeth to haue god take his trouble from him, we cannot so wel warrant that minde for a cause of so greate comfort. For both may he desyre that, that neuer mindeth to be the better, & may misse also the effect of his desyre because his request is happely not good for himself. And of this kind of longing & requiring, we shal haue occasiō farther to speake herafter. But he which referring the maner of his comforte vnto God, desireth of god to be cōforted asketh a thing so lawfull & so pleasant vnto god, that he cannot fayle to spede, & therefore hath he (as I saye) great cause to take comfort in the very desyre it selfe.
               An other cause hath he to take of that desire, a very great occasion of comfort. For sith his desyre is good, and declareth vnto himself that he hath in god a good faith: it is a good token vnto him y• he is not an abiect cast out of gods gracious fauour while he perceiueth y• god hath put such a verteous well ordred appetite in his mind. For as euery euil mind cometh of ye worlde and our selfe, and the Deuill: so is euerye such good mynde eyther immediately, or by the meane of oure good Aungell or other gracious occasyon, inspyred into mannes hearte by the goodnes of God hymselfe.

And what a comfort than may this be vnto vs, whan we by that desyre perceyue a sure vndoubted token, that toward our final saluacion our Sauiour is himselfe so graciously busy about vs?
            
            
               ¶The fourth Chapter. That tribulacion is a meane to dravve men to that good mynd to desyre and long for the comfort of God.
               
                  Vincent.
                  
                     FOrsoothe good vncle, this good mynde of longyng for Gods comfort, is a good cause of great comfort in dede: our lord in tribulacion send it vs. But by this I see wel, yt woe may thei be, which in tribulacion lacke that mind and that desyre, not to be comforted by God, but are either of slouth or impacience discomfortlesse, or of folye seeke for theyr chiefe ease and comfort any where elles.
               
               
                  Anthonie,
                  That is, good cosyn, verye trewe, as long as they stand in that state. But than must you consider, that tribulacion is yet a meane to dryue hym from that state. And that is one of the causes for whiche God sendeth it vnto man. For albeit that payn was ordeyned of God for the punyshmente of synnes (for whiche they that neuer can nowe but sinne, can neuer be but euer punished in hell) yet in thys worlde, in whiche his high mercy geueth men space to be better, the punyshmente by tribulacion that he sendeth
                        •
                      serueth ordinarily for a meane of amendment.
                  Sainct Paule was himselfe sore agaynst Chryst, tyll Christ gaue him a great fall and threw him to the ground, and strake him starke blynde: and with that tribulacion he turned to him at the fyrst woorde, and God was his phisicion, and healed hym soone after both in body and soule by his Minister Ananias, and

made him his blessed Apostle. Some are in the beginning of tribulacion verye stubborne and stiffe against god, and yet at length tribulacion bringeth thē home. The proude King Pharao dyd abyde and endure two or thre of the first plages, and would not once s
                        •
                     oupe at thē. But then god layd on a sorer lashe that made him crye to him for helpe, and then sente he for Moyses and Aaron, and confessed him selfe a synner, and god for good and righteous, and praid thē to praie for him, and to withdrawe that plage, and he would let thē go. But when his tribulacion was withdrawen, than was he naught agayne. So was his tribulacion occasion of his profyt, and his helpe againe cause of his harme. For his tribulacion made him cal to god, and his helpe made hard hys heart againe. Many a man that in an easy tribulacion falleth to seke his ease in ye pastime of worldly fantasyes, fyndeth in a greater paine al those comfortes so feble, that he is faine to fall to the seking of goddes helpe. And therefore is I saye, the very tribulacion it selfe many tymes, a meane to bringe the man to the takyng of the afore remembred comforte therin: that is to witte, to the desyer of comfort geuē by god, which desyre of goddes comfort is as I haue proued you, greate cause of comforte it selfe.
               
            
            
               ¶The fifthe Chapter. The speciall meanes to geat this firste comforte in Tribulacion.
               
                  HOwe be it, though the tribulacion it selfe be a meane oftē times to geat man this first comforte in it: yet it selfsome time alone bringeth not a man to it. And therefore syth withoute this comforte firste had, there can in tribulacion none other good comforte come forth, we muste laboure the meanes yt this first comfort maye come. And therunto

semeth one, that if the man of sloth or impacience, or hope of worldly comfort haue no minde to desyre and seke for comfort of god, those that are his frendes that come to visite and comforte him, must afore al thinge put that point in his minde, and not spend the time (as they commenly do) in trifling and turning him to the fantasies of the worlde. They must also moue him to praye god put this desire in his minde, which whē he getteth once, he than hath the first cōfort. And wythout doubte (if it be wel considered) a comforte meruelous great. His frendes also that thus counsaile him must vnto thatteyning therof helpe to praye for him, them selfe, & cause him to desyer good folke to helpe him to pray therfore. And than if these wayes be takē for the getting, I nothing doubt but the goodnes of god shal geue it.

                  Uerely me thinketh good vncle that this coūsayle is very good. For except the person haue first a desire to be cōforted by god, els cā I not se what it can auaile to geue him any further counsayle of any spiritual cōforte: howe be it what if the mā haue this desier of gods comfort, that is to wytte, that it maye please god to comfort him in his tribulaciō by taking that tribulacion frō him, is not this a good desier of goddes comfort & a desire sufficient for him that is in tribulacion?

                  No Cosin that is it not. I touched before a word of this point & passed it ouer, because I thought it woulde fall in our waye agayne, and so wote I well it wil ofter than once. And nowe am I glad that you moue it me here your self. A mā maie many times

well and wythout sinne desier of god the tribulacion to be taken from him, but neither maye we desier that in euery case, nor yet very wel in no case (except very fewe) but vnder a certayne condicion, either expressed or implied. For tribulaciōs are ye wote well of manye sōdry kindes: some bi losse of goods or possessiōs some bi y• sicknes of our selfe, & some bi the losse of frendes or by some o
                        •
                     her paine put vnto our bodyes: some by the dreade of the losing those thinges that we fayne would saue, vnder which feare fall all ye same thinges that we haue spoken before. For we maie feare losse of goodes or possessions, or the losse of our frendes, their grief & trouble or our owne: bi sickenes, imprisonmēt or other bodily payn: we may be troubled with ye drede of death, and many a good man is troubled most of all with the feare of that thing which he that moste nede hath feareth least of al, yt is to wyt, the feare of losinge through deadlye sinne ye life of his seli soule. And this last kind of tribulacion as the sorest tribulacion of all, though we touche here & there some pieces therof before, yet ye chief part & the principal point wil I reserue to treate apart effectually yt matter in ye last ende. But nowe as I said where ye kindes of tribulaciō are so diuers some of this tribulaciō. A mā may pray god take frō him & take some cōfort in the trust ye god wil so do, and therefore against hungre, sycknes, & bodily hurte & against the losse of eyther bodye or soule men maye lawfully many times pray to ye goodnes of God either for thē self or their frend. And toward this purpose, are expressely prayed many deuout or

                     Pater noster, wherein we praye daylye for oure daylye foode, and to be preserued from the fal in temptacion, and to be deliuered from euyll. But yet maye we not alwaye praye for the takyng awaye from vs of euery kynd of temptaciō. For if a man should in euery sycknes praie for his health againe, when shoulde he show him selfe content to die, and to depart vnto god? and yt mynde must a man haue ye wote wel, or els it wil not be wel. One tribulaciō is it to good mē to feele in thē selfe the conflicte of the fleshe agaynste the soule, the rebelliō of sensualitie against the rule and gouernāce of reason, the reliques that remayne in mankynde of olde original sinne, of whiche Saynt Paule so sore cōplayneth in his Epystle to the Romaines. And yet maye we not praye while we stand in this lyfe, to haue
                        •
                      this kynde of tribulacion vtterly taken from vs. For it is lefte vs by goddes ordināce to striue agaynst it, & fight wythal, and by reasō and grace to maister it and vse it for the matter of our meryte. For the saluacion of our soule, maye we boldly praye. For grace may we boldly praye, for faith, for hope and for charitie, and for euery such vertue as shall serue vs to heauen w
                        •
                     rd. But as for all other thinges before remēbred, in which is contayned the matter of euery kind of tribulacion, we maye neuer wel make prayers so presysely, but that we must expresse or imploy a condicion therein: that is to wytte, that if god see, ye contrary better for vs, we referre it whole to his wyl: and in stede of our gr
                        •
                     efe takyng awaye, praye that god maie send vs of his goodnes eyther spiritual cōfort to take it gladly, or strēgth at the least waies, to beare it paciently. For if we determine wyth our selfe that we wyl take no comforte in nothing, but in the taking of our tribulacion frō vs,

thā eyther prescribe we to god that we wyl he shall no better turne do vs though he would, than we wil our selfe appointe him, or els doe we declare, yt what thing is best for vs, our selfe cā better tel than he. And therfore I saye, lette vs in tribulacion desyer his comforte and helpe, and lette vs remitte the maner of that coumforte vnto hys owne hyghe pleasure: whiche when we doe, lette vs nothing doubte, but that lyke as hys hyghe wysdome better seeth what is beste for vs, than we can see our self: so shal his souereygne goodnes geue vs the thing that shal in dede be best. For els if we wyll presume to stand to our owne choise (except it so be) that god offer vs she choyse him selfe, as he dyd to Dauid in the choyse of his owne punishment. after his highe pride conceiued in the nombrynge of his people, we maye folishely chose the wors

Howe many mē attayne healthe of bodye that were better for theyr soules helth their bodies wer sicke stil? How many get out of prison yt happe on such harme abrode, as ye prisō should haue kept thē fro? How mani yt haue been lothe to lese their worldlye goodes, haue in kepinge of theyr goods sone after lost their life? So blīd is our mortalitie & so vnware what wil fal, so vnsure also what maner mind we wyl haue to morow, yt god coulde not lightlye do mā a more vengeaunce, than in this world to graūt him his own folishe wyshes. What wit haue we poore fooles to wyt what wil serue vs, whā ye blessed apostle him self in his sore tribulacion, praying thryse vnto

god to take it away frō him, was aunswered again by god, 
                        •
                     n a maner yt he was but a foole in asking that request, but yt the helpe of goddes grace in yt tribulacion to strength him, was farre better for him thā to take ye tribulacion frō him. And therfore by experiēce perceiuing wel the truth of ye lesson, he geueth vs good warning not to be to bold of our own mindes, whē we require ought of god not to be precyse in our askinges, but referre the choyse to god at his owne pleasure. For his owne holy spryte so sore desyreth our weale, yt as men myght saye, he groneth for vs, in such wyse as no tong can tell. Nos autem (sayeth Saynt Paule) quid o

We what we maye praye for yt were behouable for vs, can not our selfe tel: but the sprite him selfe desireth for vs with vnspekable gronynges, & therfore I saye for conclusion of this point, let vs neuer aske of god precisely our owne ease by deliuering vs from our tribulaciō, but pray for his aide & cōforte by, which wayes him selfe shal best lyke, and than maye we take cōforte of our own such requeste. For both be we sure that this mind cōmeth of god, & also be we very sure yt as he beginneth to worke with vs, so (but if our selfe flytte from him) he wyl not fayle to tarie wyth vs, and thā he dwelling wt vs, what trouble can do vs harme? Si deus nobiscum quis contra nos? If god be with vs saith saint Paule, who can stande against vs?

owne certayn wel deseruing dede open and knowne vnto thē selfe, as where we fal in a sickenes, folowing vpon our owne glotonous feastyng, or a man that is punyshed for his owne open faulte. These tribulacions loe, and such other lyke, albeit that they maye seme dyscomfortable in that a man maye be sorye to thinke him selfe the cause of his own harme: yet hath he good cause of comforte in thē, if he consydre that he maye make them medicinable for him (if him selfe will.) For where as there was dewe to that sinne (except it were pourged here) a farre greater punishemēt after this world in an other place: This wordly trybulaciō of payne & punishmēt, by goddes good prouision for him put vpō him here in this world before, shal by the meane of Christes passion (if the mā wil in true faith and good hope, by meke and pacient sufferance of his tribulacion so make it) serue him for a sure medicine to cure him and clerely dyscharge him of al the sicknes and disease of those paynes, that els he should suffer after. For suche is the greate goodnes of almyghty god, that he punisheth not one thinge twyse. And albeit so that this punishment is put vnto ye mā, not of his own eleccyon and fre choyce, but so by force as he would faine auoide it, and falleth in it aginst his wil, & therfore scantly worthy no thanke: yet so farre passeth the greate goodnes of god the poore vnperfite goodnes of mā, yt though mē make theyr rekening one here with an other: such, god yet of his hygh boū

waxeth sory, not for yt onely that he shal sustayn suche punishment: but for yt also, that he hath offended God, and therby deserued much more. Our lord frō yt time counteth it not for paine taken against his wyll, but it shalbe a merueilous good medicine, & worke as a willingly taken payne the purgacion and clensing of his soule with gracious remission of his sinne, and of the farre greater payne, yt els had bene prepared therfore peraduenture in hel for euer.

Consider well the story of Acham that cōmitted sacrilege at ye greate citie of Hierico wherupō god toke a great vengeance vpon the children of Israell, and after tolde thē the cause, and bad thē go seke the fault and trye it out by lottes, when the lot fell vpō the very man that did it, being tryed by the fallyng fyrst vpon his trybe, & than vpon his house, and finally vpon his person: he might wel see that he was deprehended, and taken against his wil, but yet at ye good exhortaciō of Iosue, saying vnto hym. Fili mi, da gloriam deo Israel, & confitere & indica mihi quid feceris & neabscondas. Mine own sonne, geue glori to ye god of Israel, and confesse and shewe me what thou hast done, and hide it not. He cōfessed humbly the thefte, and mekely toke his death therfore, & hadde, I doubt not, both strēgth & comforte in his paine, & died a very good mā (which if he had neuer come in tribulaciō had bene in perel neuer hapli to haue had iust remorce therof in al his whole life, but might haue died wrechedly

                      fro the synne yt is to come.

Howbeit I wyl aduise no mā to be so bold as to thinke yt theyr tribulacion is sente them to kepe them fro the pryde of theyr holines.

                  That is vndoubtedly true, but yet is there not good Cosyn the moste base kynde of them all, but that it hath moe causes of comfort then I haue spokē of yet. For I haue you wote well in that kynde that is sent vs for our synne, spoken of none other comforte yet but twayn: that is to witte, one that it refrayneth vs from the synne that els we woulde fall in, and in that serueth vs through the merite of Christes passiō as a meane by whiche God kepeth vs from hell, and serueth for the satisfaccion of suche payne as els we shoulde endure in purgatorye. Howbeit there is therin an other great cause of ioye besides this: For surely those paines here sent vs for our sinnes in whatsoeuer wise they happen vnto vs, be our synne neuer so sore, nor neuer so open and euidente vnto oure selfe and all the worlde to, yet if we praye for grace to take it mekely and paciently, and confessing to god that it is farre ouer litle for our fault, beseche hym yet neuerthelesse yt sith we shall come hence so void of al good workes wherof we should haue any reward in heauē
                     
to bee, not onely so mercyfull to vs as to take that oure presente tribulacion in reliefe of oure paynes in purgatory: but also so gracious vnto vs as to take our pacience therein for a matter of merite and rewarde in heauen. I verely trust, and nothyng doubte it, but God shall of his high bountie graunte vs our boone. For likewise as in hell paine serueth onely for punishmente withoute any maner of purgeyng, because all possibilitie of purgeyng is passed: and in purgatorye punishmente serueth for onely purgeing, because the place of deseruyng is passed. So whyle we bee yet in this worlde in whiche is oure place and oure time of merite and well deseruyng, the trybulacyon that is sente vs for oure sinne here, shall if we faythfullye so desyre (beside the clensyng and purgeyng of our payn,) serue vs also for encrease of rewarde. And so shall I suppose and truste in Goddes goodnes al such penaunce and good woorkes as a manne willinglye performeth enioyned by his gostlye father in confession, or whiche he willinglye farther doth of his owne deuocyon besyde. For thoughe mannes penaunce with all the good woorkes that he can dooe, be not able to satisfie of them selfe for the leaste synne that we doe, yet the lyberall goodnesse of God through the merite of Chrystes byt

oure penaunce and tribulacion paciently taken in this world to serue vs in the other worlde both for release and rewarde tempored after suche rate as his high goodnes and wisdome shal see conueniently for vs: wherof our blinde mortalite can not here ymagine nor deuise the stynt. And thus hath yet euen the fyrst kind of tribulacion and the moste basse, though not fully so great as the seconde, & very farre lesse than the thyrd farre greater cause of cōfort yet, thā I spake of before

                  Cosin, if some thinges were as they be not, thā should some thinges be as they shal not. I can not in dede say naye but that some men haue of late broughte vp some such opinions, and many moe than these besydes,

and haue spread them abrode: and albeit that it is a righte heauye thyng to see suche varyaunces in oure beliefe rise and growe among oure selfe to the greate encoragyng of the common enemyes of vs all, whereby they haue oure fayth in derision, and catche hope to ouerwhelme vs all, yet doe there three thynges not a litle coumforte my mynde.
                  The first is, that in some communicacions had of late together, hath appeared good likelihode of some good agremente to growe together in one accorde of oure faith.
                  The seconde, that in the meane whyle tyll thys maye come to passe, contencyons, despicyons, wyth vncharitable behauioure, is prohybited and forbydden, in effecte vpon all partes: all suche partes I meane as fell before to fight for it.
                  The thirde is, that all Germany for all their dyuers opynions, yet as they agree together in profession of Christes name, so agree they nowe together in preparacion of a common power, in defence of Christendome agaynste oure common enemye the Turke, and I truste to GOD, that thys shall not onely helpe vs here to strength vs in thys warre, but also that as GOD hath caused them to agree together in the defence of hys name, so shall he graciouslye bryng them to agre together in the truth of his faith. Ther

                     cion: and nothyng shall I nowe saye, but that with whiche they that are themselfe of the contrary mynd, shall in reason haue no cause to bee discontented. For fyrste, as for purgatorye thoughe they thynke there be none, yet syth they denye not that all the corps of Chrystendome by so manye hundreth yeares haue

belieued the contrarye: and among them all, the olde interpretours of Scrypture from the Apostles dayes downe to oure owne tyme, of whome they deny
                        •
                      not manye for holye Saynctes, that I dare not belieue these men againste all those. These men muste of their curtesye holde my poore feare excused, and I beeseche oure Lorde heartelye for them, that whan they departe out of this wretched worlde, they fynde no purgatorye at all, so GOD kepe them from hel. And as for the meryte of manne in hys good woorkes, neyther are they that denye it full agreed among themselfe, nor anye manne is there almoste of them all that sith they beganne to write, hath not somewhat chaunged and varied from hymselfe: and for the more parte are thus farre agreed wyth vs that lyke as we graunte them that no good woorke is oughte worthe to heauen warde withoute fayth, and that no good woorke of manne is rewardable in heauen of his own nature, but through the mere goodnes of god, that lust to set so high a price vpon so poore a thing: and that this price god setteth throughe Christes passion, and for that also that they be his own 
                        •
                     orkes with vs. For good workes to godwarde woorketh no man without god woorke with him: and as we graunte them also that no man maye be proude of his woorkes for his owne vnperfecte woorkyng, and for that in al that manne maye doe, he can doe god no good, but is a seruaunte vnprofitable, and dooeth but his bare duetye: As we I say graunt vnto them these thinges, so this one thyng or twayne doe they graunt vs agayne, that menne are bounde to woorke good workes if they haue tyme and power: and that whoso

woorketh in true fayth moste, shall be moste rewarded. But than set thei therto, that al his rewardes shal be geuen hym for his fayth alone, and nothing for hys woorkes at all, beecause hys fayth is the thyng (they saye) that forceth him to worke well. Stryue wyll I not with them for this matter now, but yet this I trust to the greate goodnesse of God, that if the question hang on that narowe poynte, whyle Christe sayeth in the Scripture in so many places
                        •
                      that menne shall in heauen be rewarded for theyr woorkes, he shall neuer suffer oure soules that are but meane witted menne, and can vnderstande his woordes, but as himself hath set them
                        •
                      and as olde holye Sainctes hath construed them before, and as all christen people thys thousande yere haue beleued, to be damned for lacke of perceiuing suche a sharpe subtyle thyng: speciallye syth some men that haue right good wyttes and are besyde that right well learned too, can in no wyse perceyue for what cause or why these folke that fro good woorkes take awaye the rewarde, and geue the rewarde all whole to fayth alone: geue the rewarde to fayth rather than to charitye. For thys graunte they themselfe, that fayth serueth of nothyng, but yf she be companyed wyth her sister charitye. And then sayeth the Scripture too, Fides, spes, charitas, tria he
                           •
                        , maior autem horum, est charitas. Of these three vertues, fayth, hope, and Charytye, of all these three, the greateste is Charitie, and therefore as woorthye thanke as fayth. Howebeit as I sayde, I wyll not stryue therefore, nor in dede as oure matter standeth, I shall not greatelye nede. For yf they saye that he whyche suffereth tribulacion or martirdome for the faith, shal haue high

rewarde, not for his woorke, but for his well working fayth: yet syth that they graunte that haue it he shal, the cause of hyghe coumforte in the thyrde kynde of trybulacion standeth, and that is you wote well the effect of all my purpose.

For as manye comfortes you wote well may a man take thereof, as there be good commodities therein: and that there be surely so manye, that it woulde be verye long to rehearse and treate of them. But me semeth we cānot lightly better perceiue what profite and commoditie, and therby what comfort the
                        •
                      maye take of it that haue it, than yf we well consyder what harme the lacke is, and thereby what discomfort the lacke therof should be to them that neuer haue it: So is it nowe that all holye menne agree, and all the Scripture is full, and oure own experience proueth at oure iye, that we be not come into thys wretched worlde to dwell here, nor haue not as Saincte Paule sayeth, oure dwellynge Citye here: but wee be sekyng for that Citie that is to come, and therefore

Saincte Paule sheweth vs that we dooe seke for it as they that are good folke, and fayne woulde come thyther dooe. For surely whoso setteth so lyttle thereby that he lysteth not to seeke therefore: it wyll I feare me be long ere he come thereat, and merueylous greate grace yf he euer come thyther. Sic

Now because that this worlde is as I tell you, not our eternall dwellyng, but our lytle whyle wanderyng, God woulde that we shoulde in suche wyse vse it, as folke that were wearye of it, and that we shoulde in thys vayle of laboure, toyle teares and myserye, not loke for reste and ease, game, pleasure, wealthe and felicytye. For they that so dooe, fare lyke a fonde felowe, that goyng towardes hys owne house where he shoulde bee wealthye, woulde for a tapsters pleasure beecome an hostler by the waye, and dye in a stable, and neuer come at home. And woulde GOD that those that drowne them selfe in the desyre of thys worldes wretched wealthe, were not yet more fooles than so. But alas theyr folye as farre passeth the foolyshenesse of that other fonde felowe, as there is dystaunce beetwene the heyghte of heauen and the veraye depth of hell. For oure Sauyoure sayeth. Ve vobis qui ridetis nunc, quia lugebitis & flebitis. Woe maye you bee that laughe nowe, for you shall wayle and wepe. Est tempus flendi, (sayeth the Scrypture) & est tempus ridendi. There is tyme of wepyng and there is tyme of laughyng. But as you see, he setteth the weping tyme before, for that is the tyme of this wretched worlde, and the laughynge shall come after in

heauen. There is also a tyme of sowyng and a time of reapyng too. Nowe must we in thys worlde sowe, that wee maye in the other worlde reape: and in this shorte sowyng tyme of thys wepyng worlde, muste we water oure sede with the showres of oure teares, and then shall we haue in heauen a merye laughyng harueste for euer. Euntes ibant & flebant (saith the Prophete,) mittentes semina sua. They wente foorth and sowed theyr seedes wepyng, but what sayeth he shall folow therof. Venie

Loe, they that in theyr goyng home towardes heauen, sowe theyr sede with wepyng, shall at the daye of iudgemente come to theyr bodies agayne, wyth euerlastyng plentye laughyng. And for to proue that thys lyfe is no laughyng tyme, but rather the time of wepyng: we finde that oure Sauiour hymselfe weped twyse or thryse, but neuer fynde we that he laughed so much as once. I wyll not sweare that he neuer did, but at ye least wise he lefte vs no ensā

Of wepyng haue we matter inough. bothe for oure owne synnes and for other folkes too: for surelye so shoulde we dooe, bewayle theyr wretched synnes, and not be glad to detracte them nor enuye them neyther. Alas selye soules, what cause is there to enuie them that are euer wealthye in this worlde, and euer oute of tribulacyon? whiche as (Iob sayeth.) Du

Nowe if heauen serue but for Chrystes dysciples, and thei be those that take theyr crosse of trybulacyon: when shall these folke come there that neuer haue tribulacyon? And if it be true that Saincte Paule saieth, that GOD chastyseth all them that he loueth, and scourgeth euerye chylde whome he receyueth, and to heauen shall none come, but suche as he loueth and receyueth: whan shall they come thyther whom he neuer chastyseth, nor neuer dooeth vouchesafe to fyle hys handes vpon them, and geue them

so muche as one lashe? And yf wee can not (as Saincte Paule sayeth we can not) come to heauen, but by manye trybulacions: howe shal they come thither than, that neuer haue none at all? Thus see we well by the verye Scripture it selfe, howe true the woordes are of olde holye Sainctes, that wyth one voyce in a maner saye al one thing, that is to wit, that we shall not haue bothe contynuall wealth in thys worlde, and in the other too. And therefore, syth they that in thys worlde without anye trybulacion enioye their long continuall course of neuer interrupted prosperitie, haue a great cause of feare and of discoumforte lest they bee farre fallen out of gods fauor, and stande depe in his indignacion and displeasure, whyle he neuer sendeth them trybulacion, whiche he is euer wonte to sende them whome he loueth. They therefore, I saye that are in trybulacion, haue on the other syde a greate cause to take in theyr gryefe great inwarde coumforte and spyrytuall consolacion.

Some of them thinke peraduenture thus. This man maketh muche of me now, and geueth me money also to faste and watche & praye for him: but so I feare me would he doe no more if I should goe tell him nowe that all that I doe for hym will not serue him but if he goe faste and watche and praie for himselfe to. For if I should sette therto and saye farther that my diligente intercession for hym, should I trust (be ye meane) that god should the soner geue him grace to amende, and fast, and watche, and praye, and take affliccion in his owne body for the bettering of hys synfull soule, he woulde bee wonderous wroth with that. For he would be loth to haue any such grace at all as should make him to leaue of any of his mirth and so sitte and mourne for his synne.

Iob was also no beggar perdye, nor no wretche otherwise, nor lost his riches & hys welth, for yt God woulde not that his frend should haue welth but for the shewe of hys pacyence to thencrease of hys meryte and confusion of the deuil, and for proofe that prosperitie may stand wyth gods fauour, Reddidit deus Iob omnia duplicia. God restored him double of all that euer he loste, and gaue hym after long lyfe to take hys pleasure long.
                  Abraham was eke you wote wel a man of greate substaunce, and so continued all hys lyfe in honor and in welth: yea, and whē he dyed to he wēt vnto such welth that Lazarus whiche died in tribulacion and pouerty, the beste place that he came to was that riche mans bosome. Finally good vncle this we fynde at our iye, and euery daye we proue it by plaine experience, that many a man is right welthy and yet therwith ryghte good: and many a miserable wretche as euill as he is wretched. And therefore it semeth harde good vncle that betwene prosperitie and tribulacion the matter should goe thus, that tribulacion should be geuen alwaye by god to those that he loueth for a sygne of saluacion, and prosperite sent for displeasure and a token of eternall damnacion.

                  Well, doe so good Cosin, and we shall mete for the remanante. Fyrste muste you Cosyn be sure that you looke wel to the marke, and that can you not doe, but if you knowe what thinge tribulacion is. For syth that it is one of the chiefe thynges that we pryncypally speake of but if you consydre well what that is, you maye mysse the marke agayne. I suppose nowe that you wyl agree that tribulation is euery suche thinge as troubleth and greueth a man eyther in bodye or mind: and is, as it were the pricke of a thorne a bramble or a bryre thrust into hys fleshe or into his mynd: and su
                        •
                     rly Cosin the pricke that verie sore pricketh the minde as farre almost passeth in paine the griefe that payneth the bodye, as dothe a thorne that styckyng in the heart, passe and excede in payne, the thorne that is thruste in the hele.
                  Nowe Cosin if tribulacion be this that I call it, than shall you sone consider this, that there be moe kindes of tribulacion, than you peraduenture thought on before. And ther vpon it foloweth also, that sythe euerye kynde of trybulacion is an interrupcion of welth and prosperitie, (which is but of wel
                        •
                     h, an other name) may be discontinewed by moe wayes than yowe would afore haue wente: Than saye I this vnto you Cosin, that syth tribulacion is not onelye suche panges as payne the body, but euerye trouble also that greueth the mynde, manye good men haue manye tribulacyons that euerye man markethe not, and consequently theyr welthe interrupted therewythe when other mē are not ware. For trowe you Cosin that the temptacyons of the deuyll the worlde and the fleshe solicyting

the minde of a good man vnto sinne, is not a great inward trouble & secrete griefe to his heart. To such wretches as care not for theyr conscience, but like vnreasonable beastes folowe theyr foule affeccions, many of these temptaciōs be no trouble at all, but matter of theyr bodily pleasure. But vnto him Cosin that standeth in dreade of god, tribulacion of temptaciō is so paynefull, that to be rydde therof
                        •
                      or sure of the victory therin (be his substaunce neuer so great) he would gladly geue more then half. Now if he that careth not for god thinke this trouble but a trifle, and with such tribulacion prosperitie not interrupted: let him cast in his minde if hym selfe happe vpon a feruent longing for the thing which geat he cannot (as a good man will not) as percase hys pleasure of some certaine good woman that wil not be naught, and than let him tel me whether the ruffle of his desier shal so torment his minde, as al the pleasures that he can take besyde, shal for lacke of yt one, not please him of a pynne. And I dare be bolde to warraunte him that the payne in resisting, and ye great feare of falling y• many a good man hath in his temtaciō, is an anguishe and a grief euery deale as great as his.
                  Nowe saie I farther Cosin, that if this be true, as in very dede true it is, that such trouble is tribulaciō, and therby cōsequently an interrupciō of prosperous welth: no man precysely meaneth to pray for other to kepe him in continual prosperitie without any maner of discōtinuāce or chaūge in this world, so y• prayer wt
                     out other cōdiciō added or imployed, were inordinate & were very childishe. For it were to praye yt eyther they should neuer haue tēptaciō, or els if yt they had they might folow it & fulfil theyr affecciō. Who dare good

Cosin for shame or for synne for hym selfe, or for anye mā els make this maner kind of praier? Besides this Cosin ye church you wote well aduiseth euerye man to fast & watch, & prai, both for tamīg of his fleshly lustes, & also to mourne and lament for his sinne before committed and to bewaile his offences done against god, and as they did at the citie of Niniue, and as the prophete Dauid did for theyr sinne put affliccion to their fleshe, and whan a manne so dooeth Cosin, is this no tribulacion to hym because he dooeth it hymselfe? For I wote well you would agree that it were, if an other man did it againste his will. Than is tribulacion, you wote well tribulacion styll, thoughe it be taken well in worthe: yea and though it be taken to with very righ
                        •
                      good wyl, yet is payn you wote wel payn, & therfore s

                        •
                     he aduiseth euery manne to take tribulacion for his synne, whatsoeuer wordes you fynde in any prayer, they neuer meane (you maye bee faste and sure) to praye god kepe euerye good manne nor euerye badde man nether, frō euery maner kind of tribulaciō. Now he that is not in some kynde of tribulacion, as peraduenture in sicknes
                        •
                      or in losse of goodes, is not yet out of tribulacion, yf he haue his ease of bodye or of mind vnquieted and therby his welthe interrupted with an other kinde of tribulacion
                        •
                      as is eyther temptacion to a good man, or voluntarye affliccion: eyther of bodye by penaunce, or of mynde by contricion and heauines for his syn & offence agaynst god. And thus I say, yt for precise perpetual welthe and prosperitie in this world, yt is to say, for the perpetuall lacke of all trouble and al tribulacion, there is no wise man that ether praieth for himself or for ani man els, & thus answere I your first

obiecciō. Now before I medle wt your secōd your third wil I ioine to this. For vpō this answer, will ye soluciō of your ensāples cōueniētly depend. As for Salomō was as you sai al his daies a merueilous welthy king, & much was he beloued wt god, I wote wel in yt beginning of his raigne: but yt the fauor of god perseuered him, as his prosperitie did yt cannot I tel. And therfore wil I not warrant it, but surely we se yt his cōtinuall wel

                      made him fal first into such wantō foli, in multiplying wyues to an horrible noumber, contrary to the commaundemente of god, geuen in the lawe of Moyses: and secondly taking to wife among other, such as were infidels contrary to an other commaundement of gods written law also, that finallye by the meane of his miscreant wife, he fel into maintenaūce of Idolatrie himself: and of this find we no amendment or repētance, as we find of his father. And therfore though he were buryed where his father was, yet whether he wente to the rest that his father did
                        •
                      throughe some secrete sorow for his sinne at last, yt is to say, by some kind of tribulacion, I cannot tel: & am content therefore to trust wel, and pray god he did so, but surely we be not sure & therfore then sample of Salomō can very litle serue you, for you might as well lay it for a profe, yt god fauoureth Idolatrie, as yt he fauoureth prosperitye: for Salomō was you wote wel in bothe. As for Iob, sith our questiō hāgeth vpō prosperitie perpetual, y• welthe of Iob yt was wt so great aduersitie so sore interrupted, can as your self seeth serue you for no ensāple. And yt god gaue him here in this world al thing double that he lost, litle toucheth my matter, which deny not prosperitie to be gods gift, & geuē to sum good mē too: namely such as haue tribulaciō too. But in Abrahā Cosī I suppose

is al your chief hold, because yt you not onely shewe riches & prosperitie perpetual in hī throw ye course of al his whole life in this world, but yt after his death also. La

                  2 Was it no trouble. y• his Cosin Loth & himself were fain to part company, because their seruauntes could not agree together?
                  3 Though he recouered Loth again from ye .iii. kīges, was his taking no trouble to him trowe you in the meane while?
                  4 Was the destrucciō of the fiue cities no heauines to his heart? A man would wene yes that redeth in ye story what laboure he made to saue them.
                  5 His heart was I dare say in no litle sorow, when he was faine to let Abimelech ye king haue his wife, whō (though god prouided to kepe vndefiled & turned al to welth) yet was it no litle wo to him in the meane time.
                  6 What cōtinual grief was it to his heart many a long daye that he had no child of his owne bodi begotten? he that doubteth thereof shall finde it in Genesis of his own moone made to god.
                  7 No man doubteth but Ismael was greate comforte vnto him at his byrthe, and was it no griefe than, when he must cast out the mother and the chylde both?
                  8 Isaac that was the chylde of Promyssyon:

although god kept his lyfe, that was vnlooked for, yet whyle the louyng father bounde hym and went about to behead hym, and offre him vp in sacrifice, who but himself can conceiue what heauines his hert had thā? I woulde wene in my mynde (because you speake of lazare) that lazars owne death panged him not so sore. Thā as laza
                        •
                     us paine was paciently borne, so was Abrahams taken not onely pacientely
                        •
                      (but whiche is a thing muche more meritorious) of obedience willingly. And therefore, though Abraham had not as he dyd in dede farre excell lazare in merite of reward, for many other thynges besyde, and specially for that he was a speciall Patriarche of the fayth, yet had he farre passed him, euen by the merite of tribulacion well taken here for gods sake to. And so serueth for your purpose no man lesse then Abraham. But now good Cosin, let vs looke a litle lenger here vpon the riche Abraham & lazare the poore, and as we shall see lazare set in welth some what vnder the riche Abraham: so shal we se another ryche man lye full lowe beneath lazare crying and calling out of his fyrie couche, that lazare myghte with a droppe of water fallyng from his fingers end, a litle coole and refresh the tippe of his burning tong. Consider well nowe what Abraham aunswered to the riche wretche. Fili recordare quia recepisti bona in vita tua & lazarus similiter mala, nune autem hic consolatur, tu vero cruciaris. Sōne, remēber that thou hast in thy lyfe receiued welthe, and lazare in lyke wyse payne, but nowe receiueth he comforte, and thou sorow, payne and torment. Christe describeth his wealthe and hys prosperitie, gaye and softe apparell wyth royall delicate fare, continuallye daye by daye. Epulabatur (saieth our Sauior)
                        •
                      
                     quotidie splendide. He did fare royally eueri day, his welth was cōtinual, lo no time of

tribulacion betwene. And Abraham telleth hym the same tale that he had takē his welth in this world, and Lazarus likewise his pain: & that they had now chaunged eche to ye cleane contrary: poore Lazar frō tribulacion into welth, & the riche man from his continual prosperite into perpetual pain. Here was laid expresselye to Lazare no very greate vertue by name nor to this riche glotton no great heynous crime, but the taking of his continuall ease and pleasure withoute any tribulaciō or griefe, wherof grewe slouth & negligence to thinke vpō the poore mans paine. For that euer him selfe saw Lazarus and wist hym dye for hunger at his dore yt layd neither Christ nor Abraham to his charge. And therfore Cosin this story lo of which by occasiō of Abraham and Lazare you putte me in remembraūce, well declareth what perell is in continuall worldly welth, and contrarywyse what comforte cōmeth of tribulacion. And thus as your other ensamples of Salomon and Iob nothyng for the matter further you: So your ensample of riche Abraham and poore Lazarus haue not a litle hindred you.

And many a man in his great payn and sickenes by callyng vpō god is meruelousli made whole. This is goddes goodnes that because in welth we remembre hym not, but forgeat to praye to him, sendeth vs sorowe, and syckenes, to force vs drawe towarde hym, and compelleth vs to call vpon hym and pray for release of our payn: wherby whē we learne to knowe hym and seke to him we take a good occasiō to fal after into farther grace.

And then lefte them ther gamners and slily slong awaye. And long was it not ere they galpeb vp the goste: And what game they came than to, yt god knoweth and not I. I praye god it were good, but I feare it very sore. Some men are there also y• doe (as did kyng Saule) in tribulaciō go seke vnto the deuil. This king had commaunded al suche to be destroyed as vse the false abhomynable supersticion of this vngracious wichecraft & Necromancye and yet fel he to such foly afterwade him selfe yt ere he wente to battayle he sought vnto a wytch & besought her to raise vp a dead

man to tell him how he shoulde spede. Nowe had god shewed him before by Samuel that he should come to nought, and he wente aboute none amendement, but waxed worse and worse, so that god lust not to looke to him: and when he soughte by the Prophetes to haue answere of god, there came none āswere to him, which thing he thoughte straunge: and because he was not with god heard at his pleasure, he made suite to ye deuil, desiring a woman by witchecrafte to rayse vp dead Samuel: but spede had he such therof, as cōmēly they haue al yt in their busines medle with such matters. For an euil aunswere had he, & an euil spede therafter, his army discomfited and him selfe slayne. And as it is rehearsed in Paralipomenon the .x. Chapter of the first boke. One cause of his fal was for lacke of truste in god, for which he left to take coūsayle of god, & fel to seke counsayle of the witch against gods prohibicion in the lawe, and against his owne good dede: by which he punished & put out all witches so late afore. Such spede let them looke for that playe the same parte as I see manye doe that in a great losse sende to seke a coniurer to geat theyr geare againe: and merueilous thinges there they see sometyme, but neuer grote of theyr good agayne. And many fond fooles there are, that when they lye sicke, will meddle with no physicke in no maner wyse, nor sende his water to no cūning mā, but send his cappe or his hose to a wyse womā, otherwyse called a wytche. Then sendeth she worde agayne yt she hath spyed in his hose, where whē he toke no hede, he was taken with a sprite betwene two dores as he went in the twylight, but the spirite would not lette him fele it in .v. dayes after: and it hathe all the

But he shal haue .v. leaues of valerian that she enchaūted with a charme, and gathered with her lefte hande: lette him laie those .v. leaues to his right thombe, not binde it fast to, but let it hang lose therat by a greene threde: he shall neuer nede to chaunge it, loke it fal not away. but let it hang till he be whole, and he shall nede nomore.

tyme at your more ease for the remnaunte. My doubt good vncle is this, I perceiue well by your answeres gathered and considered together, that you wil well agree that a man may both haue worldly welth, and yet well goe to god. And that on the other syde, a man maye be miserable and lyue in tribulacion, and yet goe to the deuill. And as a man maye please God by pacience in aduersitie, so maye he please God by thankes geuē in prosperitie. Now sith you graūt these thinges to be such that either of them both maye be matter of v

And than if this be thus, I can perceiue no cause why you should geue the preeminence vnto tribulaciō, or wherfore you shoulde recken more cause of comfort therin then you should reckē to stand in prosperitie, but rather a great deale lesse, by in maner halfe, syth in prosperitie the mā is well at ease & may also by geuing thanke to god, geat good vnto hys soule, wheras in tribulacion, though he may merite by pacience as in aboūdaūce of worldly welth, thother may by thāke. Yet lacketh he much comfort yt the welthy mā hath, in that he sore is greued with heauines and payn: besides this also, that a welthy man well at ease maye praye to god quietly & merely with alacritie and great quietnes of mynde, whereas he that lyeth groning in hys griefe can not endure to praie nor thinke almost vpon nothyng, but vpon his payne.

Now if it so be as these great learned men vpon such auctorities of holy Scripture say, that our sauiour so merited as man, and as man deserued rewarde, not for vs onely, but for himselfe also: than were there in hys dedes as it semeth, sundrye degrees & differences of deseruing, and not hys maundy like merite as hys passion, nor his slepe like merite as his watche and his prayer, no nor hys prayers peraduenture all of lyke merite neither. But though there none was, nor none coulde be in hys most blessed parson but excellent, and incomparably passyng the praier of any pure creature: yet his owne not al alike, but some one farre aboue other some. And thā if it thus be, of all his holy praiers, the chiefe semeth me those that he made in his greate agonye and paine of his bitter passion. The fyrst, whē he fel thrise prostrate in his agony, whan the heauines of his hearte with feare of death at hande, so payneful and so cruell as he well behelde it, made such a feruent

commocion in his blessed body, that the bloudy sweat of his holy flesh dropped downe on the grounde. The other wer the painfull prayers that he made vpon the crosse, where for al the tormente that he hanged in, of beating, naylyng, and stretching oute all his lymmes, with the wresting of his sinewes, and breaking of hys tender vaynes, and ye sharpe crowne of thorne so pri

The one for theyr pardon yt so dispiteously put hym to his paine, and the other about his own deliueraūce, cōmēding his own soule vnto his holy father in heauē. These praiers of his, amōg all yt euer he made, made in his most pain, reckon I for ye chief. And these praiers of our sauior at his bitter passion & of his holy martirs, in the feruour of their torment, shall serue vs to se yt there is no prayer made at pleasure so strong & effectual, as in tribulacion: now come I to the touching of the reason that you make, where you tell me that I graunte you, that bothe in wealthe and in woe some men maye be nought and offende God, the one by impacience, the other by fleshly luste. And on the other syde, bothe in tribulacion and prosperitie too, some manne maye also doe verye well, and deserue thanke of god by thankes geuen to god, as well of hys gyfte of ryches, woorship and wealthe, as of nede and penurye priesonmente, sickenes and payne, and that therefore you cannot see, for what cause I shoulde geue anye preheminence in coumforte vnto tribulacion, but rather allowe prosperitie for the thyng more coumfortable, and that not a litle, but in maner by double, syth therein hath the soule coumforte and the bodye both:

the soule by thanke (for his gyft) geuen vnto god, And then the bodye by being well at ease, where the parson payned in tribulacion, taketh no coumforte but in hys soule alone. Fyrst as for youre double coumforte Cosyn, you maye cutte of the one. For a manne in prosperitie, though he bee bounden to thanke God of hys gyfte, wherein he feeleth ease, and maye bee glad also that he geueth thanke to GOD: yet for that he taketh hys ease here, hath he little cause of coumforte, excepte that the sensuall feeling of bodelye pleasure, you lust to call by the name of coumforte. Nor I saye not naye, but that some tyme menne vse so to take it, when they saye, this good drynke coumforteth well my heart.
                  But coumforte Cosyn, is properlye taken, by them that take it ryghte, rather for the consolacion of good hope that men take in theyr heart, of some good growing toward thē, then for a present pleasure, with which the body is delyted and tickeled for the whyle.
                  Now though a man without pacience can haue no reward for his pain, yet when his payn is paciently taken for gods sake, and his will cōformed to gods pleasure therin, god rewardeth the sufferer after the rate of his payn, & thys thing appeareth by manye a place in scripture, of whiche some haue I shewed you, and yet shall I shewe you moe. But neuer founde I anye place in scripture that I remembre, in whiche though thys welthy man thanked god for hys gyft, our lorde promised any reward in heauen, because the man toke hys ease and pleasure here. And therfore, sith I speake but of such coumforte as is very coumfort in dede, by which a man hath hope of Goddes fauour, and remission of his sinnes, with minishyng of hys paynes in

purgatory, or reward els in heauen. And such comfort cometh of tribulacion, and for tribulacion well taken, but not for pleasure though it be well taken: therefore of your coūfort that you double by prosperitie, you may as I told you cut very wel away the halfe. Now why I geue prerogatiue in coūfort vnto tribulacion farre aboue prosperitie, though a man may doe well in both: Of this thing wil I shew you causes two or thre. First as I before haue at lēgth shewed you out of all question, continual welth interrupted with no tribulaciō, is a verye discomfortable token of euerlasting damnaciō, whe
                        •
                     upon it foloweth that tribulaciō is one cause of coumfort vnto a mans heart, in that it dischargeth him of the discomfort that he might of reason take of ouerlong lasting welth. Another is, that the scripture much cōmendeth tribulacion as occasion of more profit then welth & prosperitie, not to them onely that are therin, but to thē too that resorte vnto them, & therfore sayeth Ecclesiastes: Melius est ire ad domum luctus, quam ad domum conuiuii
                           •
                         En, illa enim finis cunctorum admonetur hominum, & viuens cogitat quid futurum sit. Better it is to goe to the house of weping & wayling for some mans deathe, than to y• house of a feast. For in that house of heauinesse is a man put in remembraunce of the ende of euerye manne, and whyle he yet liueth, he thynketh what shall come after. And after yet he farther sayeth: Cor sapientum vbi tristicia
                           •
                        est, et Cor stultorum vbi leticia. The hearte of wyse menne is there as heauynesse is. And the hearte of fooles, is there as is myrthe and gladnesse. And verelye, there as you shall heare worldelye myrth seeme to bee commended: in Scrypture it is eyther commonlye spoken, as in the parsone of some worldly dysposed people, or understanden of reioysyng

spirituall or ment of some small moderate refreshing of the minde, against an heauy discomfortable dulnes. Nowe whereas prosperitie was to the chyldren of Israell promised in the olde law: as a special gyft of god, that was for theyr imperfeccion at that tyme to draw them to god, with gaye thinges and pleasaunte, as mē to make chyldren learne, geue them cake bread & butter. For as the scripture maketh mencion, that people wer much after the maner of chyldren in lacke of wit, & in waiwardnes. And therfore was their master Moses called Pedagogus, that is, a teacher of children, (or as they call such one in the grammer schooles) an vsher, or a maister of the petites. For as Sainct Paul sayth. Nihil ad perfectum duxit lex. The old lawe broughte nothyng to perfeccion. And god also threatneth folke with trybulacion in this worlde for synne, not for that worldly tribulacion is euyl, but for that we should be wel ware of the sickenesse of synne, for feare of that thynge to folowe, whiche though it be in dede a very good wholesome thyng yf we wyll take it, is yet beecause it is paynefull, the thyng that we be lothe to haue.
                  But this I saye yet again and agayn, that as for farre the better thyng in this worlde toward the geattyng of the verye good that God geueth in the worlde to come: the Scrypture vndoubtedlye so commendeth trybulacyon, that in respecte and comparyson thereof, it discommendeth thys worldlye wretched welthe and discomfortable coumforte vtterlye. For to what other thyng soundeth the woordes of Ecclesiastes that I rehearsed you nowe? that it is better to be in the house of heauynesse, than to be at a feaste: whereto soundeth this comparyson of his, that the wyse mannes hearte draweth thyther as folke are in

sadnes: and the hert of a foole, is there as he may find myrth? Wherto draweth this threat of the wyse man, that he that delyteth in wealth shall fall into woe? Risus (sayeth he) dolore miscebitur, & extrema gaud

                      you wote well now. And the myrth of many that thē were in ioy, is now turned al to sorowe. And thus you see by the scripture playn, that in matter of very comfort, tribulacion is as farre aboue prosperitie, as ye day is aboue the night. An other preeminēce of tribulaciō ouer welth in occasiō of merite & reward, shal wel appeare vpon certayne consideracions well marked in them both.
                  Tribulacion meriteth in pacience, and in thobediente conforming of mans wil vnto god, & in thankes geuen to god for his visitaciō: if you reckon me nowe against 
                        •
                     hese, many other good dedes that a wealthye man may dooe: as by riches geue almose, by autoritie, labour in doing many men iustice, or if you finde farther any such other thing lyke.
                  Fyrst I saye that the pacient parson in tribulacion, hath in al these vertues of the wealthy man, an occasion of merite to, whiche the wealthye man hath not, agaynwarde, in the forerehearsed vertues of his. For it is easye for the parson that is in tribulacion, to bee

well wyllyng to dooe the selfe same if he coulde, and than shall hys good wyll, where the power lacketh, goe verye neare to the merite of the dede. But nowe is not the wealthy in a lyke cace with the wyll of pacience and conformitie and thankes geuen to GOD for tribulacion, syth it is not so readye for the wealthy man to be content to be in the tribulacion, that is occasion of the pacientes deserte, as for the troubled persone to be contente to be in prosperitie, to dooe the good dedes that the wealthy man doth. Besydes this, all that the wealthy man dooeth, though he coulde not dooe them withoute those thynges that are accoumpted for wealthe, and called by that name, as not dooe greate almose wythoute greate richesse, nor doe these manye menne ryght by hys labour, without the autoritie: yet maye he dooe these thynges being not in wealthe in deede, as where he taketh his wealthe for no wealth, nor his riches for no riches, nor in hearte setteth by neither nother, but secretly liueth in a contrite heart and a life penitenciall, as many tymes did the Prophete Dauid beeyng a greate Kynge, so that worldely wealth was no wealth to hym, and therefore is not of necessitie worldlye wealth called the cause of those good dedes, syth he may doe them, and doth them best in dede, to whom the thing that worldly folke call wealthe, is yet for hys godlye sette mynde, drawne from the delyte thereof, no pleasure in maner nor no wealthe at all. Finallye
                        •
                      whansoeuer the wealthye man doeth those good verteous dedes, if we considre the nature of them ryght, we shal perceiue that in doyng of them, he doeth euer for the rate and porcion of those dedes minish the matter of hys worldly welth,

as in geuing great almose he departeth with so much of hys worldelye goodes, whiche are in that parte, the matter of hys wealth.
                  In labouryng aboute the dooyng of manye good dedes, hys laboure minisheth hys quiete and hys rest. And for the rate of so muche, it minisheth hys wealth, if payne and wealthe be eche to other contrarye, as I wene you will agree they be.
                  Nowe whosoeuer than wyll well consider the thyng, he shall I doubte not perceyue and see therin, that in these good dedes that the wealthy manne dooeth, though he dooe them by that, that hys wealth maketh hym hable, yet in dooyng of them, he departeth (for the porcion) from the nature of wealthe, towarde the nature of some parte of tribulacyon: and therfore, euen in those good dedes themselfe that prosperitie dooeth: dooeth in goodnes the prerogatiue of tribulacion aboue wealth appeare.
                  Nowe if it happe that some manne cannot perceyue thys poynte because the wealthy man for al his almose abydeth ryche styll, and for all hys good laboure abydeth styll in hys autoritie, lette hym considre that I speake but after the porcion. And beecause the porcion of all that he geueth of hys goodes, is verye litle in respecte of that he leaueth: therfore is the reason happely with some folke li
                        •
                     le perceiued.
                  But if it so were that he wente foorthe with geuynge tyll he hadde geuen oute all and lefte hymselfe nothynge, than woulde a verye blynde manne see it. For as he were from rychesse come to pouertie, so were he frō welth, willingly fallen into tribulacion:

and betwene labour & rest, the reason goeth all alyke: whiche whoso canne consider, shall see that for the porcion in euery godd dede done by ye welthy man, the matter is al one. Than sith we haue somewhat wayed ye vertues of prosperitie, let vs cōsider on ye other side the afore named thinges yt are the matter of merite & reward in tribulacion, that is to wit, pacience conformitie and thankes. Pacience the welthy mā hath not, in that he is welthy. For if he be pinched in any pointe wherin he taketh pacience, in yt part he suffreth some tribulacion, and so not by his prosperitie, but by his tribulacion hath the manne that merite. Lyke is it if we would say, that the welthye man hath a nother vertue in ye stede of pacience, that is to wit, the kepyng of hym self from pride, and from such other sinnes as wealthe would bring him too. For the resisting such mocions, is as I before told you without ani doubt, a minishing of fleshly welth, and is a veri true kind, and one of the most profitable kyndes of tribulacion, so that al yt good merite groweth to the welthy man, not by his wealth, but by the minishyng of his wealthe with wholesome tribulacion. The moste couloure of comparison is in the other twayne: that is to witte, in the conformitie of mans wyll vnto god, and in thankes geuen vnto god. For lyke as the good man in tribulacion sent hym by god, conformeth his wyll in that behalfe, and geueth god thanke therfore, so doth ye welthy man in his welth whiche god geueth hym, conforme his wyll to goddes wyll in that poynte: sith he is well contente to take it of his gyfte, and geueth god agayne also right heartye thanke therefore. And thus as I sayde, in these two thynges maye you catche mo
                        ••
                     e coloure to compare the welthye mans merite with the meryte of

tribulacion. But yet that they be not matches, you maye soone see by thys. For in trybulacion can there none conforme his will vnto goddes, and geue hym thanke therefore, but suche a mā as hath in that point a very special good mynd. But he that is very nought, or hath in his hearte but very litle good, maye well be content to take welth at goddes hande, and say, mary I thanke you sir for this with all my hearte, and wyll not fayle to loue you well while you lette me fare no worse. Confitebitur tibi, quum benefeceris ei. Nowe if the welthy man be verye good, yet in conformitie of his will and thankes geuen to god for his welth, his vertue is not like yet to hys that doeth thesame in tribulacion: for as the philosophers sayd in that thing very wel of olde, vertue standeth in thinges of hardenes and difficulty. And than as I tolde you, much lesse hardnes and lesse difficulty there is by a great deale to be contente and conforme our wyll to goddes wil, & to geue hym thanke too for our ease, than for oure payne: for oure welth, thā for oure woe. And therefore is the conforming of oure wyll into goddes, and the thankes that we geue hym for our tribulacion, more worthy thanke agayne, and more rewarde meryteth in the very fast welth and felicitie of heauē, than our cōformitie with our thankes geuen for and in, oure worldly welth here. And thys thing sawe the deuill whan he sayed to oure Lorde of Iob, that it was no marueyle though Iob had a reuerent feare vnto god, god had done so muche for hym, and kept him in prosperitie, but the deuill wiste well it was an hard thyng for Iob to be so louing

and grudge agaynste God with impacyence. But the deuill had there a fall in hys owne turne. For the pacience of Iob in the shorte tyme of hys aduersitie, gate hym muche more fau

                        •
                      and thus haue I shewed you lo, no litle preeminence that tribulacion hath in merite, and therefore no litle preeminence of comfort in hope of heauenly rewarde aboue the vertues (the merite and cause of good hope and comforte) that cometh of welth and prosperitie.

wherin if any doubte arise, counsayle nedeth and not comforte.

But than are there some agayne that saye on the other side, that heauines of our sinnes we shal nede none at al, but onely chaunge our purpose and intent to doe better, and for that which is passed take no thought at al. And as for fasting or other afflyccion of the body, they saye we should not doe it, but onely to tame the fleshe whan we fele it waxe wan

                     on, and begin to rebel: for fasting they say, serueth to kepe the body in a temperaūce, but for to faste for penaunce, or to doe any other good worke, almose dede and other, toward satisfacciō of our owne sinne, this thing they call playne iniurye to the passion of Christ, by which onely are our sinnes forgeuen frely without any recompence of our owne. And they that woulde dooe penaunce for theyr owne sinnes, looke to be theyr own Christes, and paye theyr owne raunsomes, & saue theyr soules them selfe. And with these reasons in Saxoni, many cast fasting of, & al other bodilye afflyccion, saue onely where nede requireth

to bringe the bodye to temperance. For other good they say can it none doe to our selfe, & then to our neighboure can it doe none at all, & therefore they condemne it for supersticious foly: now heauines of heart & wepīg for our sinnes, this they reckon shame almost and womanyshe peuishnes, howebeit, thanked be God, theyr women waxe there nowe so mannyshe, that they be not so peuishe nor so pore of sprite, but that they can sinne on as men doe, and be neyther afrayde nor ashamed, nor wepe for theyr sinnes at al. And suerlye myne vncle, I haue merueled much the lesse euer since that I heard the maner of theyr preachers 
                        •
                     here. For as you remembre when I was in Saxoni, these matters were in a maner but in a māmering

                      nor Luther was not than wedde yet, nor religious men oute of theyr habyte, but suffered where those that woulde be of the secte frely to preache what they would vnto the people. And forsoth I heard a religious mā there my self, one that had been reputed and taken for very good, and which, as farre as ye folke perceyued, was of hys owne liuing somewhat auster and sharpe, but his preaching was wonderful, me thinke I heare him yet: his voice was loude and shryll, his learning lesse thā meane: but where as his matter was muche parte against fasting & al afflyccion for any penaunce which he called mennes inuencions, he cryed euer out vpon them to kepe well the lawes of Christe, let goe theyr pieuishe penaunce, & purpose thē to mend and seke nothing to saluacion but the death of Christ, for he is our iustyce, and he is our sauior & our whole satisfaccion for all our deadlye sinnes, he did ful penaunce for vs all vpon his paynefull crosse, he washed vs there all cleane wyth the water of his swete syde, and boughte

vs out of the deuils daunger with hys deare precious bloud. Leaue therfore, leaue I beseche you these inuē

Nowe so loude & so shryll he cried Christ in their eares, and so thicke he came forth wyth Christes bytter Passion, and that so bytterly spoken wyth the sweate dropping downe hys chekes, that I merueiled not though I sawe the poore women wepe, for he made my owne heere to stand vp vpon my headde, and wyth suche preaching were the people so brought in, that some fel to breake their fastes on ye fasling dayes, not of frailetie or of malice first, but almost of deuocion, lest they should take from Chryste the thanke of his bytter passion. But when they were a whyle noseled in that poynte fyrst, they could abide & endure after many thynges moe, wyth whych had he than begonne, they woulde haue pulled him downe.

                     e, and they make the people wene yt we would be saued by our own dedes without Christes death, where we cōfesse that his onely passion meriteth incomparably more for vs, than al our owne dedes doe: but hys pleasure is, that we shall also take payne our owne selfe wyth him, and therfore he byddeth all that wyll be hys dyscyples take theyr crosses vpon theyr backes as he dyd, and wyth theyr crosses folowe hym: and where they saye that fasting serueth but for temperaunce to tame the fleshe, and kepe it from wantonnes, I would in good fayth haue wente that Moyses had not bene so wylde, that for the taminge of his fleshe he should haue nede to faste whole .xl. dayes together.
                  No nor Hely neyther, nor yet our sauiour hym selfe which beganne, and the Apostles folowed, and all chrystendome haue kept the lenton .xl. dayes fast, that these folke cal nowe so foolishe. King Achas was not dysposed to be wāton in his fleshe, when he fasted and wente clothed in sacke cloth & all besprent wt asshes.

                      was not I wene, in her olde age so sore disposed to ye wantones of her fleshe yt she fasted al therefore. Nor. S. Paul ye fasted so much, fasted not all therfore neyther. The scripture is full of places that prouethe fasting not to be ye inuencion of mā but ye instituciō of god, & that it hath many moe profytes than one.
                  And that the fasting of one man maye dooe good to an other, our sauiour saieth hym selfe where he

sheweth that some kynde of diuelles can not be by one man caste out of an other Nisiin oratione & ieiunio, wythout prayer and fasting. And therfore I meruaile that they take this waye against fasting and other bodilye penance, and yet muche more I meruaile yt they mislike the sorowe and he auines and displeasure of mynde yt a man should take in forethinking of his synne. The Prophet sayth. Sindite corda vestra & non vestimenta. Teare your heartes (he sayeth) and not your clothes. And the Prophet Dauyd sayeth. Cor contritum & hu

A contrite heart and an humbled, that is to say, a heart broken, torne, and wyth tribulacion of heauines for his sinnes layed a lowe vnder foote, shalte thou not good Lord despyse. He sayeth also of hys owne contricion. Laboraui in gemitu meo lauabo per singulas noctes lecrum meum lacrimis meis stratum meum rigabo. I have laboured in my wailing, I shal euery nyght washe my bed with my teares, my couche wyl I water. But what should I nede in this matter to laye forth one place or twayne. The scripture is full of those places, by which it playnlye appereth that god looketh of duetie, not onely that we shoulde amende and be better in the time to come, but also be sorye, and wepe, and bewayle our sinnes cōmitted before, and all the olde holy Doctours be ful and whole of that mind that men must haue for theyr synnes, contricion and sorowe in heart.

But here muste you consyder that I meane not euery kynde of persecution, but ye kinde onely, whiche though the sufferer woulde be lothe to fall in, yet wyll he rather abyde it and suffer it, than by the flitting frō it, fall in ye dyspleasure of God, or leaue gods pleasure vnprocured.

For bothe by temptatiō the Deuyl persecuteth vs, & by persecucion the Deuyl also tempteth vs: and as persecution is trybulacion to euery man, so is temptacion tribulaciō to a good man.

For vnto suche a faythfull well hoping man the Prophet in the same psalme sayth farther: Scapulis suis obumbrabit tibi & sub pennis eius sperabis: with his shoulders shall he shadowe thee, and vnder his feathers shalt thou trust.
               Lo, here hath euery faythfull man a sure promyse, that in y• feruent heate of temptacion or tribulaciō (for as I haue sayde dyuers times before) they be in suche wyse coincydent, that euery trybulacion the Deuyll vseth for temptacion to bringe vs to impacience, and thereby murmure, grudge & blasphemy, and euery kynde of temptacion is to a good man that fighteth against it, and will not folowe it, a very paynfull tribulacion. In the feruent heate, I saye therfore, of euery temptacion, GOD gyueth the faythfull man that hopeth in him the shadowe of his holy shoulders whiche are brode and large suffycient to refrygerate and refreshe the man in that heate, and in euery trybulacion he putteth his shoulders for a defence betwene.

Thy hope shall be vnder his feathers, y• is to wete, for the good hope thou haste in his helpe. he will take the so nere him into his proteccyon, that as the henne, to kepe her younge chyckyns from the kyght, nestleth them togather vnder her owne wynges, so fro the deuilles clawes, ye rauenouse kyght of this darke ayre, ye God of heauen wyll gather his faithful trustinge folke, nere vnto his owne sydes, and set them in surety very well and warme vnder the couering of his owne heauenly winges. And of this defence and protection our sauyor spake him selfe vnto the Iewes, as mention is made in the .xxiii. Chapter of. S. Math. to whome he saide in this wise, Hierusalem Hierusalem que occidis Prophetas & lapidas eos qui ad te missisunt, quotics volui congregare te sicut gallina congregat Pullos suos & noluist

               Here are wordes Cosyn Uincent, wordes of no litle comforte vnto euery christen man, by which we maye see, with how tender affeccyon GOD of his greate goodnes longeth to gather vnder the proteccion of his wynges, and howe often lyke a louynge henne he clocketh home vnto him, euen those chickēs of his, that wylfully walke abrode in the kyghtes danger, and will not come at his clockynge, but euer the more he clockethe for them, the farther they goe from him. And therfore can we not doubte if we will folowe him & with faythfull hope come runne vnto him, but that he shall in all matter of temptacion take vs nere vnto him and sette vs euen vnder his wynges,

and than are we safe, if we will tary there. For against our wil can there no power pul vs thence, nor hurt our soules there. Pone me (saith ye Prophet) iuxta te, & cui

The Prophet sayth yet a great deale farther. Sub vmbra alarum tuarum exultabo. That is to wete, that we shall not onely (when we sitte by hys swete syde vnder his heauēly wing) sytte in safegard, but that we shall also vnder the couering of hys heauenly wynges, wyth greate exultacion reioyse.

For, Scuto (saith he) circundabit te veritas eius: wyth a pauice shall hys truethe enuirone and compasse the rounde aboute, and than continently folowyng, to the entent yt we should see yt it is not without necessite that the pauice of god should cūpasse vs about vpō euery syde. He sheweth in what wyse we be by the deuil with traynes and assaultes by iiii. kyndes of tēptacions & tribulacions enuyroned on vpō euery side: against al which cumpasse of tēptacions and tribulaciōs, that round cumpassing pauice of Goddes trueth, shall in suche wyse defende vs and kepe vs safe, that we shal nede to dreade none of them all.

And therefore by the nightes feare, here I vnderstande the tribulacion by whych the deuill thorowe the sufferaunce of god, eyther by hym selfe or other that are hys instrumentes, tempteth good folke to impacience as he did Iob. But he that as the prophet sayth, dwelleth and continueth faythfully in the hope of goddes helpe, shall so be becleped in on euerye syde wyth the shielde or pauice of god, that he shal haue no nede to be afrayde of such tribulacion that is here called the nightes feare. And it maye be also conuenientlye called the nightes feare for two causes. The one
                     •
                   for that many times ye cause of hys trybulacyō is vnto him that suffereth it, darke and vnknowen, and therin varyeth it, and dyffereth from that trybulacion by whych the deuill tempteth a man wyth open fyght and assaulte for a knowen good thing frō which he would withdrawe him or for some knowen euill thing into which he would driue him by force of such persecuciō. An other cause for which it is called ye nightes feare, may be for yt ye night is so farre out of courage, & naturallye so casteth folke in feare, yt of euery thing wherof they perceiue any maner dreade,

their fantasy doubleth theyr feare, and maketh them often wene that it were muche worse then in dede it is. The Phrophet sayth in the psalter. Posuisti tenebras & facta est no

               Nowe though that the Lyons whelpes walke aboute roaring in ye night and seke for theyr pray, yet can they not geat such meate as they woulde alway, but muste holde them selfe content wyth such as God suffereth to fall in theyr waye. And thoughe they be not ware therof, yet of god they aske it, and of hym they haue it. And thys maye be coumforte to al good men in theyr night feare, in theyr darke tribulacion: that thoughe they fall into the clawes or the tee

                  he of those Lyons whelpes, yet shall all that they can dooe not passe beyonde the bodye, which is but as the garmente of the soule. For the soule it selfe whiche is the substance of the mā, is so suerly fensed in rounde aboute wyth the shield or pauice of God, that as longe as he wyl abyde faythfully in adiutorio altissimi, in the hope of Godes helpe, the Lyons whelpes shall not be able to hurte it. For the greate Lyon hym selfe coulde neuer be suffered to goe farther in the trybulacion of Iob, than God from tyme to tyme gaue hym leaue. And therfore the depe darkenes of the midnight maketh men y• stande out of fayth and out of good hope in God, to be in theyr tribulacion farre in the greater feare for lacke of the light of fayth wherby they might perceiue that the vttermoste of theyr peryl is a farre lesse thing

And wheras. S. Paul in sūdry places sheweth vs that our body is but as the garment of the soule, yet the faintnes of our fayth to the Scripture of god maketh vs with the nightes feare of tribulacion more to dreade, not onely the losse of our body
                     •
                   thā of our soule: that is to witte, of the clothing thā of the substaūce that is clothed therewith, but also of the verye outwarde goodes that serue for the clothing of the body, and much more foolishe are we in that darke nightes feare, than were he that coulde forgeat the sauing of hys bodye, for feare of losing his olde rayne beaten cloke that is but the couering of his gown or his coate. Now

consider farther yet, that the Prophete in the forecemembred vearses, sayeth not that in the night walk

                   onely the Lions whelpes, but also, Omnes besties siluarum all the beastes of the wood. Nowe wote you well, that if a man walke thorowe the wood in the nighte, many thynges maye make him afrayde, of which in the daye he woulde not be afrayde of a whit: for in the nyghte euery bushe (to him that waxeth once afrayde) semeth a thefe. I remember that when I was a younge man, I was once in the war
                     •
                  e with the king: than my master (God assoile his soule) and we were camped within the Turkes grounde, many a myle beyonde Belgrade, whiche woulde God were oures nowe as well as it was than: but so happed it, that in oure campe aboute midnighte, there sodaynlye rose a rumoure and a skrye that the Turkes whole armye was secretely stealing vpon vs, wherwith oure whole host was warned to arme them in haste, and sette themselfe in aray to fighte, and than were scurars of ours that brought these sodayne tidinges, examyned more laisorly by the counsayle, what suretye or what likelyhode they had perceyued therein: of whom one shewed that by the glimuring of the moone he had espyed and perceiued and sene them hymselfe, comming on softely and soberly in a longe raunge all in a good ordre, not one farther foorth than the other in the forefrunte, but as euen as the threde, and in bredth farther than he coulde see in length. Hys fellowes beyng examined, saied that he was somewhat pricked foorth beefore them, and came so fast backe to tel it thē, yt they thought it rather time to make haste and geue warning to the campe, than to goe nerer vnto them, for they were not so farre of, but that they had yet themselfe somewhat

an vnperfecte syghte of them too: thus stoode we wat

But when the daye was sprongen, and that we sawe no manne, oute was oure scurer sente againe, and some of oure capitaines with him to shewe them where aboute the place was, in whiche he perceiued them: and when they came thyther, they found that great fearefull armye of the Turkes so soberlye commyng on, turned (God bethanked) into a fayre longe hedge, standyng euen stone styll. And thus fareth it in the nyghtes feare of trybulacyon, in whiche, the deuill to beare down and ouerwhelme with dreade the faythfull hope that we shoulde haue in GOD, casteth in oure imaginacion muche more feare than cause. For whyle there walke in the nighte, not onely the Lyons whelpes, but ouer that, all the beastes of the wood, beside the beastes that we heare roarīg in the darke nighte of tribulacion, and feare it for a Lyon, we sometyme fynde well afterwarde in the daye, that it was no Lyon at al, but a sely rude roaring asse: & the thyng yt on the sea semeth sumtime a rocke, is in dede nothing els but a mist: howbeit, as ye Prophet saith: He that faythfully dwelleth in the hope of gods helpe, the pauice of hys trouth shal so fence hym in roūd about, that bee it an asse colte, or a Lions whelpe, a rocke of stone or a mist.

                  THerefore find I that in this nightes feare, one greate parte thereof is the fault of pusillanimitie, yt is to witte, feble, and faynte stomake, by whiche a man for fainte hearte, is afrayed where he nedeth not: by reasō whereof he f

                  ee from him. This fault of pusillanimitie maketh a manne in his tribulacion for fieble heart, firste impacient, and afterwarde often tymes driueth him by impacience into a contrarye affeccion, making frowardlye, stubburne and angry againste God, and thereby to fall into blasphemye, as dooe the damned soules in hell: this faulte of pusillanimitie and timerouse mynd, letteth a man also many times from ye doing of many good thinges, whiche (if he tooke a good s

But suche folke haue nede to lyfte vp theyr heartes and call vpon God, and by the counsayle of other good ghostly folke, caste awaye the cowardise of their owne conceite, whiche the nightes feare

by whiche he hadde wente he shoulde haue excused hym selfe in that he was afrayde to put it forth in vre and occupye it, and all this feare commeth by the deuilles dryfte, wherein he taketh occasion of the fayntnes of our good and sure truste in god, and therfore let vs faithfully dwel in ye good hope of hys helpe, and than shall the pauice of his trueth so compasse vs aboute, that of thys nyghtes feare we shall haue no feare at all.

Thys gyrle is a metely good pussell in a house, neuer idle, but euer occupied and busy, but albeit she haue a verye gentle maystres yt loueth her wel, & is well content wyth that she doeth, or if it be not all well (as all can not be alwayes wel) content to pardon her as she doeth other of her felowes, and so letteth her knowe that she wyll: yet can this peuishe Gyrle neuer cease whining and puling for feare leste her maystres be alwaye angry wyth her, and yt she shal shrewdly be shent. Were her maistres wene you lyke to be cōtent with this condicion? Naye verely, I knewe such one my selfe whose maystres was a verye wyse woman, and (whiche thing is in women, rare) verye mylde and also meeke, and liked verye well suche seruice as she dyd her in her house, but this continuall dyscomfortable

               Wyth this nyghtes feare, the deuill sore troubleth the minde of many a ryghte good man, & that doeth he to bring him to some great incōuenience, for he wil if he can, driue hym so much to the fearefull mindinge of goddes rigorous Iustice, yt he wyll kepe hym from the cumfortable remembraunce of goddes greate mercy, and so make him doe all his good workes wearilye, and wythout consolacion and quicknes.

Yea & farther the deuil lōgeth to make all his good workes and spirituall excercise so painfull and and so tedious vnto him, that wyth some other subtyll suggestion or false wyly doctryne of a false spirituall libertie, he shoulde for the false ease & pleasure that he shoulde sodeinly finde therin, be easily conueied from that euill fault into a muche worse, & haue his cōscience as wide & as large after, as euer it was narrowe and strayte before. For better is yet of trueth, a conscience a lytle to strayte, then a greate deale to large.

                     , & thā foded yet forthe farder vntyll good Frydaye came.

The Foxe asked the Asse before he beganne Benedicite. wherefore he came to confession so soone before lente began. The poore beast answered hm againe: for feare of deadly sinne, and for feare he shoulde lese his part of any of those prayers that the priest in the clensinge dayes prayeth, for them that are confessed alreadye. Than in his shryfte he had a meruelous great grudge in his inwarde conscyence, that he had one daye geuē hys maister a cause of angre, in that, yt with hys rude roaring before hys maister arose, he had awaked hym out of hys slepe, and bereued hym of his reste. The foxe for ye fault
                        •
                      lyke a good dyscrete cōfessor, charged him to doe so no more, but lye still & slepe lyke a good sonne him selfe tyll hys mayster were vp, and readye to goe to worke, and so shoulde he be sure that he should not wake him no more.
                  To tel you al the poore Asses confessiō, it were a long worke: for euery thing that he dyd was deadly synne wyth him, the poore soule was so scrupulous.
                  But his wise wyly cōfessor accoumpted thē for trifles, as they were in dede, and sware afterwarde vnto the bageard that he was so weary to syt so long and heare him, that sauing for the maner sake, he had leuer haue sytten all the whyle at breakefaste wyth a good fatte goose. But when it came to the penaunce geuing, the foxe found that the most waighty sinne in al his shrift, was glotonye, and therefore he discretly gaue hym in penaunce, that he shoulde neuer for gredines of hys owne meate doe anye other beast anye harme or hinderaunce, and then eate hys meate, and studye for no more.
                  Nowe, as good mother Maude tolde vs, when the Woulfe came to confession to father Raynarde

(for that was, she said, the foxes name) vpon good frydaye, his confessor shooke his greate payer of beades vpon him, almoste as bigge as bowles, and asked hym wherefore he came so late? Forsoth father Raynarde quod the woulfe, I muste nedes tell you the truth, I come you wote well therefore, I durst come no sooner for feare lest you woulde for my glotonye haue geuen me in penaunce to fast some parte of thys lent. Naye naye, quod father foxe, I am not so vnreasonable, for I fast none of it my selfe. For I may say to the sonne betweene vs twayne here in confession, it is no commaundement of god this fasting, but an inuencion of man. The priestes make folke faste and put them to payne aboute the moone shyne in the water, and doe but make folke fooles, but they shal make me no such foole I warraunte thee sonne. For I eate fleshe all this lent my self I: howebeit, because I wil not be in dede occasion of slaunder, I therefore eate it secretlye in my chāber out of sight of al such foolishe brethren, as for theyr weake scrupulous conscience would waxe offended wythall, and so woulde I counsayle you to doe. Forsoth father Foxe quod the woulfe, and so I thanke god I doe as nere as I can, for when I goe to my meate, I take none other cōpany wyth me, but such sure brethren as are of my owne nature, whose cōsciences are not weake I warraunt you, but theyr stomake as strong as myne. Wel thā, no force quod father foxe. But when he heard after by hys confessiō yt he was so great a rauenor yt he deuoured & spent somtyme so muche vytaile at one meale, as the pryce therof woulde finde some poore man wyth hys wyfe and his children almost al ye wieke, than he prudently reproued yt poynte in hym, and preached hm a processe

of his owne temperaunce, which neuer vsed as he said to passe vpon him selfe the valure of .vi.d. at a meale, no nor yet so much neither. For when I bring home a Gose, quod he, not out of ye poulters shoppe where folke fynde them out of theyr feathers ready plucked, and se which is the fattest, & yet for .vi.d. by & chose the best: but out of the houswifes house at the first hand, whych maye somwhat better cheape aforde them you wote wel than the poulter maye, nor yet can not be suffered to se them plucked and stande and chose thē by daye, but am fayne by night to take aduenture, and when I come home, am fayne to dooe the laboure my selfe & plucke her. Yet for all this, though it be but leane, & I wene not well worth a grote, serueth it me somtime for all that both dinner and supper to. And therfore, as for that you liue of rauen, therin can I finde no fault: you haue vsed it so longe, that I thinke you can dooe none, o

                     her, and therefore were it folye to forbydde it you, and to saye the trueth against good consience to, For lyue you must I wote wel, and other craft can you none, and therfore as reason is, must you lyue by that. But yet you wote well, to much is to much, & measure is a merye meane, whiche I perceyue by your shrifte you haue neuer vsed to kepe, and therfore suerly this shall be your penance: that you shal al this yere neuer passe vpon your selfe the price of .vi.d. at a meale, as nere as your conscyence can gesse the pryce.

                      lest for lacke of that strawe, some of those pigges mighte happe to dye for colde: so helde he still his hungre tyll one brought hym meate. But whē he should fal therto, then fel he yet in a farre farther scruple, for then it came in hys mynde that he should yet breake hys penaunce if he should eate any of ye either, syth he was cōmaūded by his ghostly father that he shoulde not for his owne meate hyndre any other bea

But yet the prycke of conscience wythdrewe and helde hym backe because he woulde not for breaking of his penaūce, take any praye for his meale tide that should passe ye price of .vi.d. It happed him thā as he walked prolling for his geare about, he came where a mā had in fewe daies before, cast of two olde, leane, & lame horses, so sycke, that no fleshe was there almoste leaft on them, and the one when the woulfe came by, could scant stande vpon his legges, and the other alreadye dead, and hys skynne rypped of and caryed away. And as he loked vpon thē, sodeinly he was first aboute to fede vpon them, and whette hys teethe on theyr bones, but as he looked asyde, he spied a fayre cowe in a close walking wyth her younge calfe by her syde: and as soone as he sawe them, hys consceince began to grudge hym againste bothe those two horses, and than he syghed & said vnto him selfe. Alas wicked wretch that I am, I had almost broken my penaunce ere I was ware, for yonder dead horse, because I neuer sawe no dead horse solde in the market, and I shoulde euen dye therfore by the waye that my sinfull soule shal to, I can not deuise what price I should set vpon him, but in my conscience I set him farre aboue

vi.d. & therfore I dare not medle wt him. Now thā is yōder quicke horse of likelihode worth a great deale of money, for horse be deare in this coūtrey, specially such softe aumblers, for I see by his pace he trotteth not, nor can scāt shift a foote, & therfore I may not meddle with him, for he very farre passeth my vi.d. but kine, this countrey here hath inough

Some of my folke here can tel you, that no longer ago than euen yesterdaye, one that came out of Uienna shewed vs amonge other talking, that a riche widowe (but I forgot to aske him where it happed) hauing all her lyfe an high proude minde and a fell, as those two verteues are wonte alway to kepe cō

Duccattes for his labour to doe so muche for her, as come in a morninge early to her house, & with an axe, vnknowen, pryuelye to stryke of her head: and when he had so

done, than conuaye the blody axe, into the house of him with whom she was at debate, in some suche maner of wyse, as it might be thought that he had murdered her of malyce, & than she thought she shoulde be taken for a martyr. And yet had she farther deuysed, yt an other sūme of money should after be sent to Rome, and that there should be meanes made to ye Pope, that she might in all hast be canonyzed. This poore man promysed, but entended not to perfourme it, howebeit, when he deferred it, she prouyded ye axe her selfe, and he appoynted with her the morning when he shoulde come. But thā sette he suche other folke, as he would shoulde knowe her frantique fantasie, in such place appoynted as they might wel heare her and him talke together. And after that he had talked with her therof what he woulde, so muche as he thought was ynoughe, he made her lye downe, & toke vp the axe in his one hand, & with the other hande he felte the edge, and founde a faulte that it was not sharpe, and that therfore he woulde in no wise doe it, tyll that he had ground it sharper, he coulde not els he sayed for pietye, it would put her to so muche payne, & so full sore agaynst her wyll, for that tyme she kept her head styll: But because she woulde not suffer any moe to deceyue her so and fode her forthe with delayes, ere it was very long after, she hanged her selfe with her owne handes.

But mary if he made him fyrste perceyue howe he had been deluded, & thā tempted him to his owne death by shame & dyspayre, than was it in our matter loe, for thā was his temptacion fallen down from pryde to pusyllanimitie, & was waxen that kynde of the nightes feare yt I spake of, wherin a good parte of the counsayle yt were to be geuen him, shoulde haue nede to stand in good comfortyng, for than was he brought to ryght sore tribulacion: but as I was aboute to tell you, strength of heart and courage is there none therin, not onely for yt very strength as it hath ye name of vertue in a reasonable creature can neuer be without prudence, but also for that as I sayed euen in them that some men of most hardynes it shall well appeare to them that well waygh ye matter, yt the mynde whereby they be ledde to destroye them selfe, groweth of pusyllanymytie and very folyshe feare.

                  All those by which you maye make him perceyue that him selfe is deceyued, and that his visions be no godly reuelacions, but very deuelyshe illusions. And those reasons must you gather of the man, of the matter, and of the lawe of God, or of some one of these. Of the man, if you can peraduenture shewe him that in suche a poynte or suche, he is waxen worse synce suche reuelacions haue haunted him, than he was before, as in those y• are deluded, whoso be well acquynated with them, shall well marke and perceyue, for they waxe more proude, more wayward, more enuious, suspicious, mysseiudging, and deprauing other men, wt they delyte of theyr owne prayse, and suche other spirituall vices of the soule.
                  Of ye matter maye you gather if you haue proued his reuelacion before false, or that they be thinges rather straunge then profytable, for that is a good marke betwene Gods myracles and the deuylles wonders, for Chryst and his sayntes haue theyr myracles alwaye tendyng to fruite and profit, the Deuyll and his witches and Necromancer, all theyr wonderfull workes drawe to no fruteful ende, but to a fruitlesse ostentaciō, & shewe as it were a Iuggler that woulde for a shewe before the people, playe maystryes at a feaste.
                  Of the lawe of God you must drawe your reasons in shewing by the scripture that the thing which he weneth God by his Aungell byddeth, God hath his owne mouthe forbydden, and that is you wote wel in the case that we speake of, so easy to fynde, that I nede not to

rehearse it vnto you, syth there is playne among the .x commaundementes forbydden the vnlawfull killing of any man, and therefore of himselfe as. S. Austen sayeth, and all the churche teacheth, except hymselfe be no man.

                  This is very true good vncle, nor I will not dispute vpon any glosing of that prohibicion, but syth we fynde not the contrary but that god maye dyspence with that commaundemente himselfe, & both licence and commaunde also if him lust, any man to goe kil either an other mā or himselfe eyther: thys mā yt is now by suche a maruelouse vision induced to beleue yt God so byddeth hym, & therefore thynketh himselfe in that case of that prohibicion discharged, and charged wyth the contrary commaundement: with what reason may we make hym perceiue that this vision is but an illusion, and not a true reuelacion?

Than shal he aske me again wherby that I can proue my selfe to be awake and talke with him, and not to be aslepe and dreame so, syth in my dreame I maye as surely wene so, as I knowe that I doe so, and thus shall he dryue me to the same baye, to whiche I would bryng hym.

And here must they put hym in mynde, that if he dyspayre not, but pull vp his courage, and trust in goddes great mercye, he shall haue in conclusion great cause to be glad of this fal, for before he stoode in greater perill then he was ware of, while he tooke him selfe for better thā he was, and god for

But Cosin, if a cunning Phisicion haue a man in hand, he can wel disserne whan and howe longe some medicine is necessarye, whych at an other tyme mynistred or at that tyme ouerlonge continued might put the pacyent in peryl, for if he haue his pacient in an agewe, to ye cure wherof he nedeth his medicines in theyr workīg, cold: yet if he happe ere that feuer be full cured to fall into some such other dysease, as except it were holpen with hote medicines, were lykely to kyll the bodye before the feuer coulde be cured, he woulde for the while haue his most care to the cure of yt thing wherin were most present peril, & whan yt were once out of ieopardye, doe than ye more except diligence after, about ye farther cure of the feuer.

                  That is Cosin very true, for the deuill taketh his occasions as he seeth them fal meete for him. Some he stirreth to it through werynes of them selfe after some great losse, some for feare of bodely harme, and some as I saide, for feare of worldly shame.

                  Nowe likewise as in such folke that are full of yong warme lustie bloud, & other humors exciting the fleshe to filthy voluptuouse liuing, the deuill vseth to make those thinges his instrumētes in tempting them & in prouoking thē therūto: & where he findeth some folke ful of hote bloud & coler, he maketh those humors hys

instrumētes to set their hartes on fyre, in wrath & very fierce furious angre, so where he findeth some folk which thorow some dul melancoliouse humors are naturally disposed to feare, he casteth sometime suche a feareful imaginacion in their minde, yt without helps of god they can neuer cast it out of theyr heartes.

                  Surely me thinketh hys helpe standeth in two thinges, counsayle & prayer. First as cōcerning coūsayle, likewise as it may be yt he hath two thynges yt hold hym in hys tēptacion, yt is to wete, some euyl humors of his owne body, & the cursed deuill yt abuseth thē to his pernicious purpose, so must he nede against thē twaine, ye coūsaile of two maner of folke: yt is to wete, phisiciōs for ye bodye, & phisiciōs for ye soule: ye bodyly phisiciō shal cōsider what aboūdance y• man hath of those euil humors yt the deuil maketh his instrumētes of, in mouing ye mā toward ye feareful affeccion, & aswel by dyet conuenēt, & medicines mete therefore, to resyst them, as by purgacions to disburdaine the bodye of thē, nor let no mā thinke straūge yt I would aduise a man to take counsayle of a phisiciō for the bodye in suche a spirituall passion. For syth ye soule and the body be so knytte and ioyned together, that they both make betwene them one person, the distemperaunce of either other engendreth sumtime the distemperaunce of both twaine. And therfore, like as I would aduise euery mā in euery sicknes of ye bodye to be shriuen and seke a good sprituall phisiciō ye sure helth of his soule, which shal not onely serue againste perel yt may peraduēture farther growe by yt sicknes, thā in ye beginning mē would wene were likely: but ye cōfort therof & gods fauour encreasing there wt, shall also doe ye body good for which cause ye blessed Apo

                  I haue heard some saye vncle, that when suche folke haue been at shryft, their temptacion hath been more brymme vpon them than it was before.
               
               
                  Antony.
                  That thynke I very well, but that is a speciall token that shrifte is holesome for them, whyle the deuill is with that most wroth. You fynde in some places of the gospell, that the deuill (the parson whom he possessed) dyd most trouble when he saw that Christ would cast hym out, we must els let the deuil doe what he wyll, if we feare his anger, for with euerye good dede he wyl waxe angrie: than is it in hys shryft to be shewed hym, that he not onely feareth more than he nedeth, but also feareth where he nedeth not, and ouer that is sorye of that thing wherof (but if he wyll wyllyngly turne hys good into his harme) he hath more cause to be glad. First if he haue cause to feare, yet feareth he more than he nedeth, for there is no deuil so diligent to destroy hym. as god is to preserue him, nor no deuil so nere him to doe him harme, as god is to doe hym good: nor all the deuils in hel so strong to inuade hym and assaulte hym, as god is to defende hym, if he

distrust him not, but faythfully put his trust in hym. He feareth also where he nedeth not: for where he dredeth that he were out of goddes fauoure, because such horrible thoughtes fall into hys mynde, let hym consider, that syth they fal into hys mynde agaynst hys wil, they be therfore not imputed vnto hym. He is finally sadde of yt he maye be glad: for sith he taketh such though
                        •
                     es displeasauntly, and striueth and fighteth agaynst thē, he hath therby a good token yt he is in goddes fauour, and that god assisteth hym and helpeth hym, and maye make himselfe sure, that so wil god neuer cease to doe, but if himselfe fayle and fall from hym fyrst: and ouer that, this conflict yt he hath against his temptaciō, shall (if he will not fall where he nedeth not) be an occasion of his merite, and a right great reward in heauen: and the payne that he taketh therin, shall for so muche (as Master Gerson well sheweth) stande hym in steade of hys purgatory. The maner of the fight agaynste thys temptaciō, must stand in three thynges: that is to wete, in resisting, and in contemning, and in the inuocacion of helpe: resist must a man for his own parte by reason, consyderyng what a foly it were to fall where he nedeth not, whyle he is not dryuen to it in aduoidyng of any other payne, or in hope of winning any maner o

He must also consider, that a greate parte of thys temptacion is in effecte, but the feare of hys own fantasy, the dreade that he hath lest he shall once be driuē to it, which thing he may be sure yt, but if himselfe wyll of his own foly, al the deuils in hel can neuer driue him

Therefore, like as against the vice of the fleshe, ye victory stādeth not al whole in the fight, but also some tyme in the flight, sauing that it is in dede the parte of a wyse warriours fyghte, to flie from hys enemyes traynes, so must a man in thys temptacion to, not onely resist it alwaye wyth reasoning there agaynst, but some time set it cleane at right naught, and cast it of when it cometh, and not once regarde it, so muche as vouchesafe to thynke thereon. Some folke haue been clearely rydde of such pestilent fantasyes with very full contempt thereof, makyng a crosse vpō their heartes bydding y• deuil auaunte, and some tyme laugh him to scorne to, & than turne theyr mynd vnto some other matter, and whē the deuil hath sene yt they haue set so litle by hym, after many assayes

made in suche tymes as he thought most mete, he hath geuen that temptaciō quite ouer, both for that ye proud spirite cannot indure to be mocked, and also lest with much tempting the man to the same, whereunto he could not in conclusion bryng him, he shoulde muche therby encrease hys merite: the finall fight is by inuocacion of god, both by praying for himself, and desiring other also to praye for hym, both poore folke for his almose, & other for their charitie, specially good priestes in that holy sacred seruice of the masse, and not onely them, but also his owne good aungels, and other holye saintes, such as his deuocion standeth specially vnto. And if he be learned, let him vse the Letanie with the holy suffrages that folowe, whiche is a prayer in the churche of maruelouse olde antiquitie, not made firste as some wene it were by that holy man.

For Cosin, as it is a thīg right hard to touche pytche & neuer fyle the fingers, to put flex vnto fyer, and yet kepe if from burning, to kepe a serpent in thy bosome, and yet be safe frō stinging, to put young men with young women, without daunger of foule fleshlye desire: so is it hard for any parsō, either mā or womā, in great worldly wealth and much prosperitie, so to withstande the suggestions of the deuil, and the occasions geuen by ye world, that they should kepe them selfe frō the deadly desyre of ambicious glory, wherupon there foloweth, if a man fal therto, an whole floud of all vnhappy mischief, arrogant maner, high solaine solemne port ouerloking ye poore in worde and countenaunce, displeasaunt and disdainouse behauour, rauen, extorcio

in holding them vprighte in their temptacions, geue place to the deuill in the contrary temptacions, wherby for faynte heart, they leaue of good busines wherin they were well occupyed, & vnder pretext (as it semeth to themself) of humble heart and mekenes, and seruing god in contemplacion and silence they seke their own ease & earthly reste vnware wherwith, (if it so be) god is not wel content: howbeit, if it so be that a man fele hymselfe such in dede as by experience that he hath of hymselfe, he perceyueth that in wealth & auctoritie he doth hys own soule harme, and cannot doe therin, the good that to hys part appertaineth, but seeth ye thinges that he should set hys hand to sustaine, decaye thorow his default, and fal to ruine vnder him, and that to the amendment therof, he leaueth his own dutye vndone: than would I in any wise aduise him to leaue of that thyng, be it spirituall benefise that he haue, personage or bishoprike, or temporall roume and auctoritie, and rather geue it ouer quite, and drawe hymselfe asyde and serue god, than take the worldli worship and commoditie for himselfe, with the incommoditie of them whom his duety were to profite.

But now a Christē man Cosyn that hath ye lyght of faith, he cannot faile to thinke in this thing much farther, for he wil thinke not onely vpō his bare coming hither, & his bare going hence again, but also vpon the dreadful iudgemēt of god, & vpon ye feareful paines of hel, and of the inestimable ioyes of heauen. And in the cōsidering of those thynges, he wil cal to remēbraunce that paraduenture when this begger & he be both departed hence, ye begger may be sodeynly set vp in such roialtie, y• wel were himselfe yt euer was he borne if he might be made his felow: & he that wel be thinketh him Cosin vpon these thinges, I verely thynke that the arrowe of pryde flying forth in y• day of worldly welth,

shal neuer so wounde hys heart that euer it shal beare hym vp one fote.

I can not see but that euery riche man hathe

great cause to stande in great feare of damnaciō, nor I can not perceiue as I saie, howe he can be deliuered of that feare as long as he kepeth his riches, and therfore though he mighte kepe hys riches, if there lacked poore men, & yet stand in goddes fauour therewith, as Abraham dyd, and many an other holy riche mā since: yet it such aboundance of poore mē as there be nowe in euery countrey any man that kepeth any ryches, it muste nedes be, that he hath an inordynate affeccion thereunto, while he geueth it not out vnto the poore nedy persōs, yt the duety of charitie bindeth & straineth him to.

                  NOr I saye not this to the entent to comforte riche men in heaping vp of riches, for a lytle comforte is bente inough thereto for them. They be not so proude hearted and obstinate, but that they would I wene, to that counsayle be with right lytle exhortacion verye conformable. But I say this for those good mē to whom god geueth substance, and the minde to dispose it well, & yet not the minde to geue it all awaye at once, but for good causes to kepe some substance still, should not dispaire of goddes fauour for the not doing of the thing, which god hath geuen them no commaundemēt of, nor drawen by anye special calling therunto. acheus loe, that clymed vp into the tree for desier yt he had to behold our sauiour, at such time as Christ called aloude vnto him & sayd: zacheus, make hast & come downe, for this daye must I dwel in thy house. Zacheus was so glad therof, & so touched inwardly wt special grace to the profite of his soule, that whereas al ye people murmured much that

Christ would call him and be so familiar with hym, as of his owne offre to come vnto his house, considering that they knewe him for the chiefe of the Publicanes, that wer customers or tolle gatherers of themperours dueties: all which whole company were among ye people sore infamed of rauine, extorciō and bribery, & than zacheus, not onely the chiefe of that felowship, but also growen greatly riche, wherby the people accoumpted him in theyr own opinion

                  Thys was vncle, a gracious hearyng, but yet I marueile me sūwhat wherfore zacheus vsed his woordes in that maner of ordre. For me thinketh he shoulde first haue spoken of making restitucion vnto those whom he had begyled, and than speake of geuing his almose after. For restitucion is, you wote well, duetye, and a thing of such necessitie, that in respect of restitucion, almose dede is but voluntarye. Therefore it might seme, that to put men in mind of theyr duetie in making restitucion fyrst, and doing theyr almose after

                     nacion, euen for his riches alone, though he demeaned it neuer so well. But Cosin, men of substaūce must there nedes be, for els shal you haue moe beggars pardie, thē there be, & no man left able to relieue another. For this thinke I in my mind a very sure conclusion, that if al the money that is in this cūtrey, were to morowe next brought together out of euery mans hand,

and layd al vpon one heape, and than deuided out vnto euerye man alike, it would be on the morrowe after worse than it was the day before. For I suppose whan it were all egally thus deuided amōg al, the best should be left litle better, than a begger almost is now: and yet he that was a begger before, al that he shalbe the richer for y• he should therby receiue, shal not make him much aboue a begger stil: but many one of ye riche me if their riches stode but in moueable substaunc
                        •
                     , shalbe safe inough frō riches haply for al their life after. Men can not you wote well liue here in thys worlde, but if that some one mā prouide a meane of liuing for some other many, euerye man cannot haue a ship of hys own, nor euery man be a marchaunt without a stocke, and these thinges you wote wel must nedes be had: nor euery mā cannot haue a plowe by himselfe. And who might liue by the taylors craft, if no man were able to put a gown to make? who by masonrye? or who could liue a carpenter, if no man were able to builde neither churche nor house? Who should be makers of anye maner of cloth, if there lacked men of substaunce to set sondry sortes a worke? Some man that hath but two duccates in his house, we

For surely the riche mannes substaunce is the weispring of the poore mans liuing. And therfore here would it fare by ye poore man as it fared by ye woman in one of Esopes fables, which had an henne that layde euery daye a golden egge, tyll on a day she

For while he cometh vnder yt colour of ayde for ye one against the other, he wil sumwhat se the profe before he fully shew himself.

               Not any man Cosin? They say more than they can make good that tell you so: he maketh a solemne othe among the Ceremonies of that feast in whiche he fyrste taketh vppon hym hys aucthoritie, that he shall, in all that he possible maye, mynyshe the

fayth of Christ, and dilate the fayth of Machomet. But yet hath he not vsed to force euery whole countrey at once to forsake theyr faith. For of some coūtreyes hath he been content, onely to take a tribute yerelye, and let them liue than as they lust. Out of some he taketh the whole people away, dispersyng them for slaues among many sundry countreyes of his, very farre from their own, without any sufferance of regresse. Some countrey so great and populous, that they cannot wel be caried and conuayed thence: he destroyeth the gentlemen and geueth their landes part to such as he bringeth, & part to such as willingly wil reuye their fayth, and kepeth the other in such misery, that they were in maner as good to be dead at once. In rest he suffreth elles no christē man almost, but those that resort as marchātes, or those that offer themselfe to serue him in his warre. But as for those christen countreyes, that he vseth not for only tributories as he doth Thio, Ciprys or Candy, but reckoneth for cleare conquest, and vtterlye taketh for his owne, as Morea, Grece & Macedony, and such other like. And as I verelye thinke, he wil Hungary, if he geat it. In al those vseth he christē people after sondry fashions. He letteth thē dwel there in dede because they wer to many to cary al away, & to many to kil them all to. But if he should either leaue the land dispeopled and desolate, or els some other countreyes of his own, from whence he should (which would not wel be done) conuay the people thether, to people that land withall. There loe, those that wil not be turned frō their faith, of which god kepeth (lauded be his holy name) very many he suffereth to dwell still in peace.

or honeste rowme they beare none: with occasyons of his warres he pylleth them with taxis and tallagis vnto the bare bones, their children he choseth where he lust in their youth, and take

                  h them frō their parentes conueying thē whither he lust, where their frendes neuer see thē after, & abuseth thē as he lust. Some yong maidens maketh harlots: some young mē he bringeth vp in warre, & some young children, he causeth to bee geldyd, not theyr stones cut out, as the custome was of olde, but cutteth of their whole members by the body: howe fewe scape and lyue, he litle forceth, for he wyll haue in oughe. And all that he so taketh younge, to any vse of his own, are betaken vnto such Turkes or false renagates to kepe, that they be turned frō the fayth of Christ euery chone, or els so handled, that as for thys world they come to an euil cheuing. For beside many other cōtumelyes, & dispightes that the Turkes and the false renagate christians, many tymes doe to good christen people, that still perseuer and abyde by the faith, they find the meane somtime to make some false shrewes say, that they heard such a christē man speake opprobrious wordes agaynst Machomet, & vpon that poynt falsely testified, wyl they take occasion to compell him forsake the fayth of Christe, and turne vnto the profession of their shamefull supersticious secte, or els will they put him to death with cruel intollerable tormētes.

               In good fayth Cosin, so begin we to fare here in dede, and that but euen now of late. For since the title of the crowne hath come in question, the good rule of this realme hath very sore decaied, as litle while as it is: and vndoubtedli Hungary shal neuer doe wel, as long as it standeth in thys case, that mens myndes harken after nouelties, & haue their heartes hanging vpon a chaunge: & much the worse I like it, when their wordes walke so large toward ye fauoure of y• Turkes s

These tokens were somewhat lyke your ensample of the sea, sith they be of thinges yt after folow,

               That is veri wel said Cosin, let vs haue our sure hope in him, and thā shal we be very sure yt we shal not be deceiued: for either shall we haue ye thing yt we hope for, or a better thyng in y• stede: for as for ye thing it self yt we pray for, & hope to haue, god wil not alway sēd vs, & therefore as I said in our first cōmunicaciō, in al thyng saue onely for heauē, our praier nor our hope, mai neuer be to precise although y• thing be lawful to require.

of man shall come againe, yt is to wytte, to the daye of general iudgement, wenest thou that he shal find faith in the earth, as who say but a litle? For as appeareth in the Apocalyppes, and other places of scripture, he sayth shalbe at that time so farre faded, that he shall for the loue of his electes, leste they shoulde fall and perishe to, abredge those daies and accelerate his comming. But as I saye, me thinke I mysse yet in my mind, some of those tokens that shall by the scripture come a good while before that. And amonge other the cōming in of ye Iewes, & the dilating of christendome againe before the world come vnto that strayght. So that I saie, for my owne minde I lytle doubt, but that this vngracious secte of Machomet shal haue a foule fal, & christendom spryng & spread floure, and encrease again: howbeit, the pleasure and comfort shal they se yt shal be borne, after that we be buried, I feare me bothe twain. For god geueth vs greate likelihode, yt for oure sinneful wretched liuing, he goeth about to make these infidels, y• are his open professed enemies, the sorowful scourge of correccion, ouer euil christen people, that should be faithful, and of truth are his falsly professed frēdes. And surely Cosin, albeit yt me thinketh I see diuers euil tokēs of this misery cōming to vs, yet can there not in my mind be a worse prognosticacion therof, thā this vngracious tokē yt you note here your self. For vndoudtedly Cosin, this new maner here of mens fauorable fashiō in their lāguage toward these vngracious Turkes, declareth plainly that not onely theyr mindes geueth thē yt hither in shall he come, but also yt they can be cōtent, both to liue vnder him, & ouer yt fro the true faith of Christ to fal into Machomethes false abhominable secte.

For of these two yt stryue whither of thē both shal raigne vpon vs, & eche of thē calleth him selfe king, & both twaine put ye people to payne: The one is you wote well, to farre frō our quarter here to helpe vs in this behalfe.

For of Turkes natural this coūtreye lacketh none nowe whiche are here conuersaunte vnder diuerse pretextes: & of euery thinge aduertise the greate Turke full surelye. And therefore Cosin, albeit yt I would aduise euerye man, praye stil & call vnto god to holde his gracious hande ouer vs, and kepe away thys wretchednes if his pleasure be: yet would I farther aduise euery good christē bodye, to remember and consider, yt it is verye likelye to come, and therfore make his reckoninge and cast his penny worthes before, and euerye man and

euery woman appoint with goddes helpe in their own mynde before hand, what thyng they entende to dooe if the very worst fall.

For Cosin, if his mind answere him, as. S.

But now is al ye perel, if the mā answere himself yt he would in such case rather forsake the faith of Christ wt his mouth, & kepe it stil in his heart, thā for ye cōfessing of it, to endure a paynful death: for by this mind falleth he in deadly sinne, which while he neuer cometh in ye case in dede if he neuer had put him selfe ye case he neuer had fal in: but in good fayth me thinketh yt he which vpō ye case put vnto himself by himself, wyl make himself yt answere, hath ye habite of faith so faint & so cold yt to ye better knowledge of himself, & of his necessitie, to pray for more strēgth of grace, he had nede to haue the questiō put him, either bi himself, or some other mā. Besides this, to coūsayle a mā neuer to thinke on ye case, is in my mynd as much reason, as ye medicine yt I haue heard taughte one for ye tooth ache to goe thrise about a churche yard, & neuer thinke vpō a foxe taile: for if ye coūsaile be not geuē thē, it cannot serue thē, & if it be geuē thē, it must put y• point of ye matter in their minde, which by & by to reiect, & thinke therin neither one thīg or other, is a thing yt may be sooner bidden then obeied. I wene also that very fewe men can escape it but that thoughe they woulde neuer thynke thereon by them selfe, but that yet in one place or other where they shall happe to come in companye, they shall

haue the question by aduenture so proponed and putte forth, that like as while he heareth one talkyng to him, he may wel winke if he wil, but he cānot make himselfe slepe: so shal he whether he wil or no thinke one thing or other therin. Finally, whē Christ spake so often & so playne of the matter that euerye man shoulde vpon payne of damnacion, openly confesse hys fayth if men toke hym, and by dreade of death would driue hym to the contrary, it semeth me in a maner implied therein that we be bound cōdicionally, to haue euermore that mynde actually, sometyme & euermore habitually: that if the case so shoulde fal, than with goddes helpe, so we woulde, and thus much thinketh me necessary for euery man and woman, to be alwaye of thys mynde, and often to thinke thereupon: and where thei finde in the thynkyng theron, theyr heartes agryce, and shrinke in the remembraunce of the payne

                  When I was fyrste in Almayne Uncle, it happed me to be somewhat fauoured wyth a great man of the Churche, and a greate state, one of the greatest in al that countrey there, and in dede whosoeuer might spende as much as he might in one thing and other, were a right greate state in anye countrey of christendome. But gloryous was he verye farre aboue al measure, and that was great peitye, for it dyd harme, and made him abuse many great gyftes that god had geuē him, neuer was he sac

So happed it one daye, that he hadde in a greate audience, made an Oracion in a certaine maner, wherein he liked him self so wel, that at his dinner he satte hym thought on thornes, tyll he myght heare howe they that satte wyth hym at hys boarde woulde commende it: and when he had sytte musing a whyle, deuising (as I thought after) on some prettye proper waye, to bring it in wythal: At laste, for lacke of a better (lest he shoulde haue letted the matter to longe) he broughte it euen bloontly forthe, & asked vs al that satte at his bordes ende (for at his owne messe in the myddest, there satte but him selfe alone) howe wel we lyked hys Oracion yt he made that daye. But in fayth Uncle, when that probleme was once proponed, till it was ful answered, no man I wene eate one morsel of meate more, euerye man was fallen in so depe

                  By oure ladye vncle, not one woorde. But lyke as I trowe. Plinius telleth, that whan Appelles the painter (in the table that he painted of the sacrifice, and the death of Iphigenia) had (in the makyng of the sorowefull countenaunces of the noble menne of Grece that beheld it) spente oute so muche of hys craft and hys connyng, that when he came to make the countenaunce of kyng Agamemnon, her father whiche ye reserued for the laste, leste if he hadde made his visage before, he muste in some of the other after, eyther haue made the visage lesse dolorous than he could, and thereby haue forborne some parte of his praise, or doyng the vttermoste of hys crafte, myghte haue happed to make some other looke more heauely, for the pitie of her paine, than her owne father, which had bene yet a farre greater faulte in hys payntyng, when he came I saye to the makyng of hys face therfore laste of all, he coulde deuyse no maner of newe heauye cheare and countenaunce for her father, but

that he had made there alreadye in some of the other, muche more heauye before, and therefore to thentent that no manne shoulde see what maner countenaunce it was that her father had, the paynter was fayne to paint him, holding hys face in hys hande kercher, the like pagiaunt in a maner plaied vs there this good auncient honorable flatterer: for when he sawe that he coulde finde no woorde of prayse that woulde passe all that had been spoken beefore alreadye, the wylye foxe woulde speake neuer a woorde, but as he were rauished vnto heauen warde, with the wonder of the wysdome and eloquence that my Lordes grace had vttered in that Oracion, he fette a long sighe with an Oh from ye bottome of hys breste, & helde vp both hys handes, and lyfted vp hys head, and cast both hys yien vp into the welkin and wepte.

                  Forsoth Cosin he played hys parte very properlye, but was that great prelates Oracyon any thyng prayse worthy? for you can tell I see well, for you would not I wene playe as Iuuenal merely describeth the blynde Senatoure one of the flatterers of Tyberyus themperoure, that among the remnaunte 
                        •
                     o magnified the greate fyshe that themperoure hadde sente for them to shewe them, whiche thys blinde Senatoure, Montanus I trowe they called hym, marueled of as muche as any that marueled moste: and many thynges he spake thereof, with some of hys woordes directed thereunto, lookyng hymself toward the lyfte syde, whyle the fyshe laye on hys ryghte syde, you woulde not I trowe Cosin haue taken vpon you to prayse it so, but if you had heard it.

                  I heard it vncle in dede, and to say the trouth it was not to dispraise: howbeit surelye somewhat lesse prayse might haue serued it, by more a great deale than the half: but thys am I sure, had it been the worst that euer was made, the prayse had not been the lesse of one here. For they that vsed to prayse hym to hys face, neuer considered, howe muche the thing deserued, but how great a laude and prayse themselfe could geue his good grace.

                  Surely Cosin as Terence sayeth, suche folkes make men of fooles euen starke mad, and much cause haue theyr lordes to be righte angry with them.

                  God hath in dede, and is I wene, but as for their lordes vncle, if they would after waxe angrye with them therfore, they should in my mynde doe them very greate wrong, when it is one of the thynges that they specially kepe them for. For those that are of suche vaynglorious mynd (be they lordes or be they meaner men) can be much better content to haue their deuises commended then amended: and requier they their seruaunt and their frende neuer so specially to tell them the very trueth, yet shall he better please them if he speake them fayre, then if he tell them trueth. For they be in the case yt Martial is speaketh of, in an Epigrame vnto a frende of his that requireth his iudgemēt, how he liked his vea

shoulde serue for a leage betwene the countreye and a great Prince. In which treatise, himself thought that he had deuysed his articles so wysely, and indicted thē so wel, that al the world would allow them: wherupon longing sore to be praised, he called vnto him a frende of his, a man well learned, and of good woorship, and very well expert in those matters, as he that had been diuerse tymes embassadour for that countrey, and had made manye suche treatises hymselfe. When he toke him the treatise, and that he had read it, he asked hym howe he lyked it and sayd: But I pray you tell me the verye trouth, and that he spake so heartely, that the tother had went he would fayne haue heard the t

                  Without question Cosyn, I cannot greatly blame him, and thus themselfe make euerye manne mocke them, flatter thē & deceiue them. Those I say, that are of suche vayneglorious mind: For if they bee content to heare the trueth, let them than make muche of those that tell them trueth, and withdrawe theyr eare from them that falsely flatter them, and they shal be more truelye serued than with .xx. requestes praying men to tell them trueth. Kyng Ladislaus, our lord assoyle his soule, vsed muche thys maner among his seruauntes, when any of them praysed any dede of his, or any condicion in him, if he perceiued that they sayde but trueth he woulde let it passe by vncontrolled. But when he sawe that they sette to a glose vpon it for hys prayse of their owne makyng besyde, then woulde he shortlye saye vnto them: I praye thee good fellowe,

And thys goeth not onelye to men of meane authoritie, but vnto the very greatest. The princes thēself can not haue you wote well al theyr wyll: for howe were it possible while eche of them almost would, if he myght, be lord ouer al the remnaunte? Than many men vnder theyr princes in authoritie, are in the case that prieuy malice and enuie many beare them in hearte falselye speake them fayre, and prayse them wyth their mouthes which when there happeth any greate fal vnto them, baule and barke and byte vpon them lyke dogges.

If we would wel consider these wordes of our Sauiour Christ, we should as me thinke, nede no more coūsel at al, nor no more comfort neither, concerning the losse of our temporal substaunce in thys Turkes persecucion for ye fayth. For here our lord in these wordes teacheth vs where we may lay vp our substaunce safe before the persecucion come. If we putte it into the poore mens bosomes, there shall it lye safe.

And therfore is god very good lord vnto vs, when he causeth like a good husband man his folke to come afield, (for the persecutors be his folke to this purpose) and with their hookes & their stocking yrons, grubbe vp these wicked wedes & busshes of our earthly substance, & cary them quite awaye from vs that the woorde of God sowen in oure heartes, may haue rowme therin, and a glad rounde aboute for the warmesome of grace to come to it and make it growe. For surelye these woordes of our Sauiour shal we finde full true. Vbi thesaurus tuus, ibi est et cortuum Where as thy treasure is there is also thy heart.

So maye we verely thinke yet oure selfe muche more madde (seeyng that we be sure it can not be long ere we shalbe sent spyte of our teeth oute of this world) if the feare of a litle lacke, or the loue to see our goodes here about vs, and the lothnes to part from them for this litle while, which we may kepe thē here, shalbe able to let vs from that sure sendyng them before vs into the tother worlde, in which wee may be sure to liue wealthely with them, if we sende them thither, or els shortly leaue them here behinde vs, and thā stād in great ieopardy, there to liue wretches for euer.

                  Neither haue I cause to meruayle therof, nor you Cosin cause to be dismayde therefore. The great horror & feare that our Sauiour had in his own flesh agaynst his paynful passiō, maketh me litle to meruayl, & may wel make you take that comfort to, yt for no such maner of gendring felt in your sēsual partes, the flesh shrinketh at the meditacion of payne and death, youre reason shal geue ouer, but resist it and manlye maister it: and though you woulde fayne flee from the payneful death, and be loth to come thereto: yet may the meditacion of his great grieuous agony moue you, & him selfe shall, if you so desyre him, not fayle to worke with you therin, & geat and geue you the grace that you shal submit and conforme your will therin vnto his, as he did his vnto hys father, & shal therupon be so cōforted with the secret inward inspiracion of his holy sprite, as he was with the personal presence of yt Angell, that after his agony came & comforted him, that you shall as his true disciple folow hym, and with good will without grudge, doe as he did, and take your crosse of pain & passion vpon your backe, and dye for the trueth with him & therby raigne with him crouned in eternal glory.

And this I say to geue you warning of the thyng tha

                      is truth, to thentent whan a man feleth such an horror of death in his heart, he should not therby stand in outragious feare that he were fallyng, for many such men standeth for al that feare, full fast. And finally, better abydeth the brunte when god is so good vnto hym, as to bryng hym therto and encourage hym therin, thā doth some other, that in the beginning feleth no feare at al, and yet may it be, and most oftē so it is, for god hauing many mansions, and all wonderful welthfull in his fathers house, exalteth not eueri good mā vp to the glory of a martyr, but foreseing their infirmitie, that though they be of good wyll before, and peraduenture of right good courage to, would yet play.

as we maye well see bothe in sundrye stories, and in the Epistles of Saincte Ciprian also. And therefore whiche waie GOD wyll take with vs, we can not tell: but surelye if we be true Christian men, this can we wel tell, that withoute anye bolde warrantise of oure selfe, or foolishe truste in oure strength, we be bound vpon pain of damnacion, that we be not of the contrarye mynde. but that we wyll wyth hys helpe, (how lothe so euer we fele oure fleshe thereto) rather yet than forsake hym or hys fayth afore the worlde (whyche if we dooe, he hath promysed to forsake vs afore hys father, and all the holy coumpanye of heauen.) Rather I saye, than we would so dooe, we would with his helpe endure and sustayn for his sake all the tormentrye that the deuyll with all hys faithlesse tormentors in thys world, would deuyse. And then when we be of thys mynde, and submytte oure wyll vnto hys, and call and praie for hys grace, we can tell well ynough that he will neuer suffre them to putte more vpon vs, than his grace wyll make vs all to beare, but wyll also wyth theyr temptacion prouyde vs for a sure waye, for Fidelis deus?

                  I am sory yt I did enterrupte your tale. For you were about I se wel to take an orderly way therin. And as yourself haue deuised, so I beseche you procede.

For these infidele Emperours handle often times the princes that they take, more villanously, then they doe the poorest men, as the great Tamberlayne kepte the greate Turke whan he had taken him, to treade on his backe alwaye while he lepte on horse backe. But as I beganne to saye by the sample of a prince taken priesoner, were the impriesonmente neuer so fauorable, yet were it in my minde no litle griefe in it selfe for a man to be pinned vp, though not in a narowe chaumber, but although hys walke were right large, and right fayre gardens to therin, it coulde not but grieue hys hearte to be restrained by an other man, wythin certaine limittes and boundes, and lese the libertie to be where him lust.

                  Thys is Cosin well considered of you. For in this you perceiue wel, that imprysonment is of hym selfe, and hys owne very nature alone, nothing els but ye retaining of a mannes persō wtin the circuite of a certaine space narrower or larger as shalbe lymited to him, restraining his libertie frō the father going into any other place.

                      you haue many good condicions: but suerly though I say it before you, to ye cōdicion is none of thē: which cōdiciō if you would amende, than should you haue yet ye moe good cōdiciōs by one. And peraduēture by mo thā .iii. or foure. For I assure you, it is harde to tel howe much good to a mannes soule ye personal visiting of poore prisoners doth. But nowe sith you can name me none of them that are in priesō, I praye you name some one of al thē, yt you be, (as you saye) better acquainted wt, men I meane, yt are out of prison: for I knowe me thynke as fewe of thē as you knowe of ye tother.

                  Well Cosin, whether euery waye walking beggre be by this reason out of priesō or no, we shal cōsidre farther whē you wyl: but in ye meane while I can by thys reasō see no prince yt semeth to be out of prison. For if the lacke of libertie to goe where a mā wyll be impriesonment,

as your selfe saye it is. Than is the great Turke by whom we so feare to be put in prisō, in prison already him selfe. For he may not goe where he wil, for and he mighte, he woulde into Portingale, Italie, Spaine, Fraūce, Almayne & Englād & as farre on an other quarter to: both preter Iohns land & ye graund Canis to. Nowe ye begger yt you speake of, if he be as you saye he is, by reason of hys libertye to goe where he will, in muche better case then a kinge, kepte in prieson because he can not goe but where mē geue h
                        •
                     m leaue: thā is yt begger in better case not onely then a prince in prieson, but also thē many a prince out of prison to. For I am sure there is many a begger yt maye wtout let, walke farther vpō other mennes grounde, thā many a prince at his best libertie maye walke vpō his owne. And as for walking out abrode vpon other mēnes, yt prince might happe to be sayd naye, & holden faste, where that begger with hys bagge and hys staffe would be suffered to goe forth & holde on his waye. But for as much Cosin, as neyther the begger nor ye prince is at free liberty to walke where they will, but that if they would walke in some place, neither of thē both should be suffered, but men would wtstand thē & say thē nay: Therfore if priesonmēt be (as you graūte it is) a lacke of liberty to go where we lust, I can not se but as I saye ye begger & the prince, whom you recken both at libertie, be by your own reasō restrayned in prison both.

                  Yea but vncle ye tone & the tother haue waye inough to walke: ye tone in his owne grounde, ye tother other mennes, or in ye common hye waye where they may walke till they be both wery of walking, ere any mā say thē nay.

                  This were you wote wel true, although a man should be but takē by ye arme, & in faier maner lead out of this world vnto his iudgemēt, but now while we wel know, yt there is no king so great, but yt al ye while he walketh here, walke he neuer so lose, ride he with neuer so strong an army for his defence, yet himselfe is very sure (though he seke in the meane season some other pastyme to put it oute of hys mind) yet is he very sure I say, y• scape he cannot, & very wel he knoweth, that he hath already sentence geuē vpon hym to dye, and that verely dye he shal, and that himselfe (though he hope vpon long respyte of his execucion) yet can he not tell how soone. And therefore, but if he be a foole, he can neuer be without feare, that eyther on the morow, or on the self same day, the grisely cruel hangman, death, whiche from his fyrst coming in hath euer houed aloofe, and looked toward him and euer lye in a wayte on hym, shal amydde among al his royaltie and al his mayn strength, neyther knele before hym, nor make him any reuerence, nor with anye good maner desyre him to come foorth, but rigorouslye and fiercely grype hym by the very brest, and make all hys bones rattle: and so by long and diuerse sore tormētes, stryke him starke dead in thys prieson, and then cause his bodye to bee cast into the grounde in a foule pytte, within some corner of the same, there to rotte and bee eaten with the wretched wormes of the earth, sending yet hys soule out farther vnto a more fearefull iudgement, whereof at hys temporall death, hys successe is vncertayne, and therefore thoughe by Goddes grace not out of good hope: yet for al that, in ye meane while in verye sore dreade and feare, and peraduenture in

peryl vneuitable of eternal fyre too. Me thinketh therfore Cosin, that as I tolde you, thys kepyng of euery man in this wretched worlde for execucion of death, is a very playn imprisonment in dede, & ye as I say such yt ye greatest kyng is in this prisō, in much worse case in all hys wealth, then many a manne is by the other imprysonmente, that is therein sore and hardelye handled. For where some of those lye not there attaynted nor condemned to deathe, the greatest manne of thys worlde, and the moste wealthye in this vnyuersall pryson is layde in to be kepte vndoubtedly for deathe.

                  That is verye trueth Cosin in dede, and wel obiected too: but then must you consider, that he is not in daunger of death, by reason of that prisō, into which he is put, peraduenture but for a light fray: but his daū
                     ger of death is by the other imprisonment, by which he is prisoner in ye great prisō of this whole earth, in which prisō al ye prīces therof be prisoners as wel as he, if a mā condēned to death wer put vp in a large prisō, & while his execuciō wer respited, he wer for fightyng with hys felowes put vp in a straight place: part of ye same he is in daūger o

                      death in yt straite prisō, but not by ye being in yt, for therin is he but for ye fray: but his deadlye imprisonment was ye other (ye larger I say) into which he was put for death. So the prisoner yt you speake of, is beside ye narow prisō, a prisoner of ye brode world, & al the princes therof, therin prisoners with him. And by ye imprisonment, both thei & he in like daunger of death, not by ye straite imprisonment, yt is commonly called imprisonmēt, but by yt imprisonmēt which (because of y• large walke,) mē cal it libertie, and which prison you thought

                  If a man be Cosin cōmitted vnto prieson, for no cause but to bee kept, though there lye neuer so

And also if the prisoner be vnruly, and fall to fyghting with his felowes, or doe some other maner of shrewde turne, then vseth the keper to punish hym sundry wise, in some of such fashions as your selfe haue spoken of.

but that as they be priesoners, so be we too: and that as some of them be sore handled so be some of vs too: syth we wote well for all thys, that when wee come to those pryesons, we shall not fayle to be in a straiter prison then wee be nowe: and to haue a doore shutte vppon vs, where we haue none shutte on vs nowe: thys shall we be sure of at the leaste wyse, if there come no worse.

                        •
                      that by the forsaking of our faythe, we fall into the state to be cast into the prieson of hell, and that can we not tell how soone: but as it may be that God wil suffre vs to liue a while here vpon earth, so may it be that he will throwe vs into the dongeon beneath, before the tyme that the Turke shall once aske vs the question. And therefore if we feare impriesonmentes so sore, we bee muche more than madde, if we feare not most the more sore: for out of that prieson shall no man neuer geat. And in this other shall no man abyde but a whyle. In prieson was Ioseph, whyle his brethren were at large, and yet after were his brethren fayne to seeke vpon him for bread. In prieson was Daniel, and the wilde Lyons aboute hym: and yet euen there God kepte him harmelesse, and brought hym safe out agayne. If we thinke that he wil not doe the lykewyse for vs, let vs not doubte but he will doe for vs, eyther the lyke, or better. For better maye he dooe for vs, if he suffre vs there to dye. Sainct Iohn the Baptist was you wote well in prieson, whyle Herode and Herodias sate full mery at the feaste, and the daughter of Herodias delyted them with her daunsing, tyl with her daunsyng she daunsed of Sainct Iohns head. And nowe sitteth he with great feast in heauen at Gods boarde, while Herode and Herodias full heauely sit in hel burning both twayne. And to make them sporte withal the deuil with the damosell daunse in the fyre afore thē. Finally Cosyn

to finishe this piece with, oure Sauioure was him selfe taken prisoner for oure sake, and prisoner was he caryed, and prisoner was he kepte, and prisoner was he brought foorth before Annas. And prisoner from Annas caryed vnto Caiphas. Than prisoner was he caryed from Caiphas vnto Pilate: and prisoner was he sente from Pilate to kyng Herode: prisoner from Herode vnto Pilate agayne. And so kepte as prisoner to the ende of his passion. The time of his imprisonment I graunt wel was not long, but as for hard handling (which our hertes most abhorre) he had asmuch in that short whyle as many mē amōg thē al in much longer time. And surely than, if we consider of what estate he was, and therewith that he was prisoner in suche wyse for our sake, we shall I trowe (but yf we be worse then wretched beastes (neuer so shamefully play the vnkind cowardes, as for feare of imprisonmente sinnefully to forsake hym, nor so foolishe neyther, as by forsakynge of hym, to geue hym the occasion againe to forsake vs, and wyth the auoydyng of an easyer prison, fall into a worse. And in stede of a prison that cānot kepe vs lōg, fal into that prison, oute of whiche we can neuer come, where the shorte prisonment would winne vs euerlasting libertie.

And yet you se for al this, that euen thys poynt too, taketh encrease or minishmēt of drede after the difference of the affeccions that are before fixed and rooted in the mynde so farre forth that you see some man set so muche by his worldlye substaunce, that he lesse feareth the losse of his life, than the losse of landes: yea some manne shall you see that abyde

other) haue not letted wyllinglye to suffre deathe, diuerse in diuerse kindes: and some both with dyspightful rebuke and painful tormente too. And therfore as I say, we may see that the affeccion of the mynde towarde the encrease or decrease of the dreade, maketh muche of the matter. Now are the affeccions of mens myndes imprinted by diuerse meanes: One waye, by the bodely sences moued by suche thinges pleasant or dyspleasant, as are outwardly thorow sencible worldly thinges offered and abiected vnto them. And thys maner of receyuyng the impressyon of affeccions, is common vnto menne and beastes. Another maner of receiuing affeccions, is by the meane of reason, which
                        •
                      both ordinately tempereth those affeccions, that the bodely .v. wittes imprint and also dysposeth a man many tymes to some spiritual vertues, very contrarye to those affeccions that are fleshly and sēsual. And those reasonable disposicions been affeccions spirituall and proper to the nature of man, and aboue the nature of beastes. Now as our gostly enemy the deuil enforceth hymselfe to make vs leane to the sensuall affeccions and beastly: so doth almightye God of hys goodnes by hys holye spirite inspire vs good mocions, with ayde and helpe of hys grace towarde the tother affeccions spirituall, and by soondrye meanes instructeth oure reason to leane vnto them, and not onelye to receyue them as engendred and planted in our soule, but also in suche wyse water them with wyse aduertisement of godly counsayle and continuall prayer, that they maye be habitually radycate, & surely take depe roote therein, and after as the tone kynde of affeccion or the tother beareth the strength in our heart, so be we stronger or febler agaynst the terror of death in thys cause.

And therefore will we Cosin, assaye to consider what thinges there are for which we haue cause in reason
