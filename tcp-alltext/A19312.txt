            WHich 70 pound 8. shillings 6. pence, together with 30. pound added thereunto by

an vnknowne person, for the furtherance of the said free Schoole, was paid vnto the Right honourable Henry Earle of Southhampton, for the honourable Company of Virginia, at their great and generall Quarter Court, held the 21. of Nouem. 1621. And the said Court, for the better maintenance of the said Schoole, Schoolemaster, and Vsher intended there to be placed, granted 1000. acres of land to the said free Schoole, to bee at Charles Cittie, as the most commodious place for health, security, profit, and conueniency: And appointed that with the said 100. pound 8. shillings 6. pence, there should be sent ouer presently an Vsher, for the instructing of the children there, in the principles of Religion, ciuility of life, and humane learning: as also that fiue persons (besides an ouerseer of them) should be foorthwith sent in the condition of Apprentices, to manure and cultiuate some part of the said land, for the vse and benefit of the said Vsher, till God stirred vp the hearts of others to be further helpefull to the said Schoole.
            Likewise the said honourable Virginia Court thought fit in honour of the said East-India Benefactors, the said free Schoole should bee built, and the said 1000. acres set out in Charles Citie, to be called The East-India Schoole: And that the East-India Companies seruants, should haue precedence before any other, to preferre their children thither, to be brought vp in the rudiments of learning.
            They thought fit also, that this (as a Collegiat

or free Schoole) should haue dependance on Henrico Colledge in Virginia, which should be made capable to receiue Schollers from the Schoole, into such Schollerships and Fellowships as the said Colledge shall be endowed withall, for the aduancement of Schollers, as they shall rise by degrees and desert in learning.
            There was since by a person refusing to be named, sent into the great and generall Quarter Court held for Virginia, the 30. of Ianuary 1
                  â¢
               21. 25. pound tovvard the furtherance of this godly vvorke: So that novv there is in all 125. pound 8. shillings 6. pence.
            
               They that be wise, shall shine as the brightnesse of the firmament; and they that turne many to righteousnesse, shall shine as the Stars for euer and euer, Dan. 12. 3. 
            For publike actions of vertue, besides that they are presently comfortable to the doers, are also exemplary to others; and as they are more beneficiall to others, so are they crowned in vs: our principall care should bee, that while our soules liue in glory in heauen, our good actions may liue vpon earth, and that they may be put into the banke and multiply, while our bodies lie in the graue and putrifie.
            
               
                  Whosoeuer shall receiue such a little child in my name, receiueth me, Mat. 18. 5.
