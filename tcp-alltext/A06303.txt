houſe of Parliament.
            
               The humble Petition of the Felt-makers in and
neare London,
            
            Moſt humbly ſhewing,
            THat his Maieſtie by his Proclamation dated 2. Decemb. An. 11. Iacobi, did
ſtraightly prohibite all perſons from thenceforth to vnſhip, diſcharge, or lay
on lād in England or in Wales any Felts, Hats, or Caps, wrought or halfe wrought
in any part beyond the ſeas, And did thereby command all his Cuſtomers and Officers
of his Ports to forbeare to take any entries of the ſame.
            That there are neuertheleſſe great numbers of Felts and Hats made beyond
the ſeas, which are dayly brought by ſtrangers into this Realme, and put to ſale
in this Kingdome, in contempt of his Maieſties ſaid Proclamation and prohibition.
            The petitioners further ſhew, that by reaſon of the permiſſion of the importation
into this Realme of the ſaid manufacture of Felts and Hats ready wrought;
and for that there is no prohibition againſt the buying of the ſame in this kingdome,
infinite numbers of people are thereby employed and relieued beyond the
ſeas, and contrariwiſe many thouſands of his Maieſties poore ſubiects which were
accuſtomed to be employed and ſet on worke by the Felt-makers of this Realme,
in carding, baſenning, felting, dreſſing, pouncing, blocking and dying, with certaine
other feates concerning Felt-making, are now vtterly vndone, and many of
them (for want of employment) are fallen to idleneſſe, begging, and betake themſelues
to other euill courſes, to the great ſcandall of the gouernment of this Commonwealth.
            And foraſmuch (as the Petitioners conceiue,) there is no Statute or Law of
this Realme in force to preuent thoſe great miſchiefes and inconueniences, They
do therefore moſt humbly pray, that (for the reliefe of ſo many thouſands of his
Maieſties ſubiects) there may be ſome ſeuere law made in this preſent Seſſion of
Parliament as well for the prohibition of the importation into this Realme of
Felts and Hats wrought and halfe wrought beyond the ſeas, as alſo for the puniſhment
of ſuch as ſhall buy the ſame in this kingdome.
