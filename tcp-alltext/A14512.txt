               HOwſoeuer it came to paſſe by Gods appointment, that gouernes all things, that the fleete of 8 Shippes, lately ſent to Virginea, by meanes the Admirall, wherein were ſhipped the chiefe Gouernours, Sir Thomas Gates, S. George Sommers, and Captaine Newport, by tempeſtuous windes and forcible Current, were driuen ſo farre to the Weſt ward, that they could not in ſo conuenient time recouer Cape Henrie, and the Port in Virginea, as by the return of the ſame fleete, to anſwer the expectation of the aduenturers in ſome meaſure:
            By occaſion whereof, ſome few of thoſe vnruly youths ſent thither, (beeing of moſt leaud and bad condition,) and ſuch as no ground can hold, for want of good directions there, were ſuffered by ſtealth to get abord the ſhips returning thence, and are come for England againe, giuing out in all places where they come, (to colour their owne miſbehauiour, and the cauſe of their returne with ſome pretence) moſt vile and ſcandalous reports, both of the Country it ſelfe, and of the Cariage of the buſineſſe there.
            Which hath alſo giuen occaſion, that ſundry falſe rumours and deſpightfull ſpeeches haue beene deuiſed and giuen out by men that ſeeme of better ſort, being ſuch as lie at home, and doe gladly take all occaſions to cheere themſelues with the preuention of happy ſucceſſe in any action of publike good, diſgracing both the actions and actors of ſuch honourable enterpriſes, as whereof they neither know nor vnderſtand the true intents and honeſt ends.
            Which howſoeuer (for a time) it may deterre and keepe backe the hands and helpe of many well diſpoſed men, yet men of wiſdome and better reſolution doe well conceiue and know, that theſe deuices infuſed into the tongues and heades of ſuch deuiſors (by the Father of vntruths) doe ſerue for nothing elſe, but as a cloke to couer the wretched and leaud prancks of the one ſort, and the ſtupidity and backwardneſſe of the other, to aduance any commendable action that taxeth their purſe, and tendeth not wholly to their owne aduantage.
            And therfore thoſe of his Maieſties Counſel in this honourable plantation, the Lords, Knights, Gentlemen, and Merchants intereſſed therein (rightly conſidering that as in all other good Seruices, (ſo in this) much loſſe and detriment may many waies ariſe and grow to the due meanes and manner of proceeding, which yet no way toucheth nor empeacheth the action it ſelfe, nor the ends of it, which do ſtill remaine entire and ſafe vpon the ſame grounds of thoſe manifold Chriſtian duties whereon it was firſt reſolued,) are ſo farre from yeelding or giuing way to any hindrance or impeachment of their cheerefull going on, that many of them both honourable and worſhipfull haue giuen their hands and ſubſcribed to contribute againe and againe to new ſupplies if need require.
            And further, they doe inſtantly prepare and make ready a certaine number of good Shippes, with all neceſſaries, for the right honourable Lord de la Ware, who intendeth God aſſiſting, to be ready with all expedition to ſecond the foreſaid Generals, which we doubt not are long ſince ſafely ariued at their wiſhed port in Virginea.
            
            And for that former experience hath too dearely taught, how much and manie waies it hurteth to ſuffer Parents to diſburden themſelues of laſciuious ſonnes, maſters of bad ſeruants, and wiues of ill huſbands, and ſo to clogge the buſineſſe with ſuch an idle crue, as did thruſt themſelues in the laſt voiage, that will rather ſtarue for hunger, then lay their hands to labour:
            It is therefore reſolued, that no ſuch vnneceſſary perſon ſhall now be accepted, but onely ſuch ſufficient, honeſt and good artificers, as
                  Smiths,
                  Shipwrights,
                  Sturgeon dreſſers,
                  Ioyners,
                  Carpenters,
                  Gardeners,
                  Turners,
                  Coopers,
                  Salt-makers,
                  Iron men for furnaſſe & hammer,
                  Brickmakers,
                  Bricklayers,
                  Minerall men,
                  Bakers,
                  Gun-founders,
                  Fiſhermen,
                  Plough-wrights,
                  Brewers,
                  Sawyers,
                  Fowlers,
                  Vine-dreſſers,
                  Surgeons,
               
and Phyſitions for the body, and learned Diuines to inſtruct the Colonie, and to teach the Infidels to worſhip the true God. Of which ſo many as will repaire to the houſe of Sir Thomas Smith Treaſurer of the Company to proffer their ſeruice in this action before the number be full, and will put in good ſureties to be readie to attend the ſaid honourable Lord in the voyage, ſhall be entertained with thoſe reaſonable and good conditions, as ſhall anſwere and be agreeable to ech mans ſufficiency in his ſeuerall profeſſion.
