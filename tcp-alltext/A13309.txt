            The didicatorie epistle to her heighnesse.
            
               MADAM this table of treasons doth your heighnes to witt of à booke called, A treatise of treasons against you and the Croune of England. That treatise is addressed of gratefull affection borne to yow, 
                  •…
               nd discovereth hidden treasons, which 
                  •…
               each to the danger of your person, of your 
                  •…
               ate and life. That treatise discovereth the 
                  •…
               ransposing of the crowne, the extincting of your line, and the hazarding of the Re
               
                  •…
               lme. It openeth vnto yow the contrivers of those treasons to be a couple of companions

of base parentes borne: first callid to Court, thone from booke, thother from butterie: which two be now more then Barons by office and dignitie, more then Earles by possessions and wealth, more then Dukes in authoritie: which two be now your cosoning Counsaillors, though sett vppe by your good fauour in the cheifest places of the Realme, whereby they haue made them selues mightie in money, mariages and allies, and be the two captaine cōspiratours, that haue in their owne power and in the handes of their confederates, all the offices, all the portes, all the fortresses, your treasour, your armour, yea your selfe, your succession and the whole realme to dispose at their will: They be the two captaine conspiratours, that haue beset yow rownde abowte with feares, and dangers prepared by them selues and by sondrie fine deuises remoued from yow all defenses of faithfull frindes at home and a broade, deuided the realme into factions, abused your authoritie, imploied your treasours to the danger of your state, to the infamie of your person, and to your final ouerthrow by death or depriuation 
                  •…
               ere it be long.
            Thus that treatise discouereth those two traiterous Counsaillours: who to worke

more subtilly their mischeuous intentions, and to kepe yow from espying their terrible treasons, haue misleaden yow by a false show of other treasons, wich were neuer intended, and abused yow vndre title of dutie, pretence of seruice, and colour of securitie to hold them vnsuspected.
            In that treatise also your heighnes shal see the vnbuckling and lifting vpp of their

            That treatise of treasons is abridged into this table, which showeth forth but in

            The author of the treatise, and the abridger of the same beare good affectiō to yow and to the realme: and therefore doe discouer vnto you the present perills that now hang over both: which when yow shal by survew perceave and vnderstand, God giue yow grace, to consider and preuent.
            And Madam for that it cannot be doubted but that those two Conspiratours doe watchfullie care and politickly provide, how to kepe frō yow alletters, bookes and treatesies, which they feare may let or discouer their final purpose: It hath ben thought neccessarie to invent and find owt all good meanes whereby the said treatise or at least the Table of the same, might by some more faithful seruant of yours, be addressed to your owne handes: for the which respect it hath bene by meanes conveighed to the sight of your trustie servant Mr. Hatton (and others) who of dewtie and alleageance hath bene thought the most fitt instrument to present yow the same. wherein he shal showe your heighnes, more love dutie and faithful obediece, then those of your Counsaillors, that so many monethes sithence, haue had the treatise it selfe

in their handes and concealed the same, either of doubt their practises might be vntimelie discouered and preuēted, or in deede for lack of love towardes your heighnes person: which standeth in greater perill then yow can beleeve. God geve yow grace to sorsee and avoide the same.

               The keping of the Queene of ScotlandFo. 115. in prison, is a plaine promise of their indempnitie, for murdering the Queene her selfe.

                  The Iustice of the Realm is prostibulatedFi. 149. to be sold or hyred for money, by malice or affection.
               By the ministerie of Rob. Beale in theFo. 126. yeare 1563. the conspiratours haue procured that the doubtfull wedlocke betwen therle of Harford and the ladie Cather. in their frindes opinions, by the seales and firmes of certaine forrein learned men, is cleared againe, which the conspiratours reserue in secret to serue a tourne when the daie commithe.
               They procured that the statute madeFi. 152. for the Oth of the womanish Primacie should binde the inferiour multitude vnto that, wherein it leaueth the Nobilitie free.
               They ordeined the penaltie of an otherFo. 152. statut to take place from xiiij. yeres before the crime or any offence committed.
               The Q. is weakened, the Nobilitie abbased,Fo. 153. the people pillaged, them selues enriched, their confederates strengthened.

                  The Q. of Scotl. could never obtein toFo. 24. come to the sight, presence, nor speach of the Q. to pleade her innocencie: could never obtaine sentence to be geuen for her or against her iudiciallie: could never obtein to come to the Parliament, there to acknowledge and confirme the Q. estate, though she importunatlie laboured the same.

               e vnto yow, is most to be considered: as that yow were first baptized in the faith Catholicque, your continuance for manie yeres therein, and the danger in forsaking the same: the weight whereof no worldlie treasors or dignities can counteruaille: the one being eternall, the other temporall, brittle and fraile, as ouer manie of your condition haue tried, finding their experience powdered with bitter repentance. But your Naturall good inclination

giueth forth bettre hope that yow will in time embrase the best, wherevnto itseemeth God moueth yow, by laying his heauie hand louinglie vppon yow, that yow might for errors past, endeuour timely satisfaction, and thereto hath brought yow to a safe porte, if yow list therein to repose and quiet your selfe▪ where doubtlesse yow shal finde more trew comfort and peace of conscience, then if yow would (delighting still in vanities) retourn againe to the place that floweth and abondeth with the tempestes of wordlie temptations.
            And for that yow be knowen to be in the good fauour and grace of your Prince and to tendre mattres that appertaine to her securitie, and would what in yow lieth aduance to her knowlege, whatsoeuer threatneth her perill, her state, and the cutting of, the rightful Succession of the same: as also to be readie to ministre her the occasion whereby her heighnes may in time repaire her dishonors and infamies procured by such as she accompted her most faith full subiectes, this inclosed being a table of Treasons collected owt of a booke latelie come owt of Frāce is addressed vnto yow, that you should thereof make speedie conveye, in sort that the same may not faile to passe directlie to her heighnes handes. in

Thus wisshing yow as much grace and comfort as to my selfe, doe hartelie recōmend yow to the mercies of almightie God. From Antwerp. the 26. of Iune 1573.

               CERTAIN IMPORTANT POINTS added by the Abridger of the Treatise, after the deliuery of the Table to Mr. Hattons handes, implying vehement demonstrations of the present peril of your Heighnes life and person.
            
               ALBEIT your Heighnes great wisedom cānot but easily finde in this table and treatise the great dāger and peril that imminently dependeth vpon your person and life, if the practise of these Cō
               spiratours be not prevented before it take their desired end: Tyme yet (being the trewest discoverer of all hiddē mischeiffes) having daily more and more revealed the same by sondrie new argumentes since the treatise was finished (which hath byn concealed by the Cōspiratours frō your heighnes knowlege) your gratious, and benigne Nature, will not disdaine (I trust) the simple oblation of this my poore myte, added and cast into the copius heape of Tallentes presented vnto yow by the Author of the booke before me: who for my part intende breiflie to yelde yow euident demonstrations of the present peril your person standeth in.
            
               
               FIrst therefore let it like your Heigh. a litleI. to obserue that policie of theirs lately put in vre (since they vndrestood by the edition of that treatise, that their mischeuons machination was eyed and smelled,) by which they haue for a yeres time almost pretended, and by brute suffred toSinō tournithe over a nevv leafe. be geuen out, that they deeme now the Prince of Scotland most fitly and rightfully to be declared by your Heigh. and the Realm, next heire apparant in Success. And marck yow how by this sweete bayte they haue alluered and enamoured (as it were) the Scottish nation to consent to the deliuery of this lambe into the woulfes handes: Behold I saie how lately and suddain this change commeth, euen now hotly and warmly, when they haue for 12. or 
                     •…
                  
                  ▪ yeres space before, by forging of lies, by falsefying of old lawes, by forcing of new, by libelles, by preachers in al pulpettes and printed bookes, traueiled and laboured by all possible meanes to depriue and declare both him and his Mother vncapable of that Crowne in Success. And looke yow a litle into it, vnto what other end this is done, but only by hooke or by crooke, by one way or other to winne and wreast the person of the Infant into their handes. Remembre what huge sommes of money haue byn offered for the possession of his person: what dishonourable, attemptes by corruption to cause his Nobilitie to consent to his deliuerie. And why is that so gredelie sought and

in suche hast, with what cost soeuer? Let all stories be sought, and one example showed, where an Infant Prince was by such corrupt meanes violently wreasted into the custodie of them that helde his parētes in prison, other then to his bane, ruyne, and confusion. The consideration whereof implieth manifestlie that they intend by waie of preuention to warrant them selfes from being callid to anie accompt of what soeuer they haue done or shall doe, when they haue cut of the three impediments that lye betweene the Crowne and the lyne of Suff. which be, your selfe the principal, with the Mother and childe.
            
            
               NOw that they haue brought both yow andII. your Realm so deeplie into the infamy of the world, by iniurying all Catholicque Princes for supporting their own priuat ambition with heresie and rebellion euerie where: And finding your nature repugnant to those odious iniuries of your neighbours, and your wisedom not flexibleThe Q. ovvn polecie more secure, then Sinons fine fetches. to consume your treasure and Realme so effuselie as they wold poure it owt in this quarell, and their partie thereby not so stronglie supported in France and Flandres as they desire, they haue therefore no better remedie, then to get that Childe into their handes, whose name and authority they maie vse to remoue yow, for the better aduancement of their faction abroade.
            
            
               
               LIke as the Conspiratours polecie requirethIII. your safetie whiles the Mother and Sonne of Scotl. be owt of their handes: euen so is it aboue all most necessarie for their principall end, hauing once fingered the Childe (as they haue alreadie the mother,) to make an end of yow and your Cosin the Queene of Scotland, whether the Child shal liue or not: since vndre him they are sure for a tyme whereas vndre neither of yow both, they finde them selues in the securitie they desire (lookeing howrelie when yow would charge them for stayning your honour, indangering your state, intangeling your realme with so manie forrain qwarrels of iniurie and reuenge) and not induring the feare and danger of being charged therewith, doe prouide for their owne securitie, and finde no waie assured but your death or depriuation when they haue once that Child in their handes.
            
            
               NOw that they haue brought to passe,IIII. that the religion is in debate, your person in contempt among the protestantes and hated of the puritaines, the Crowne in question, the people deuided, and the realme answerable for infinite iniuries done to nations adioyning: they must dispatche your heighnes by preuention, least yow might in good time charge them, (if God so moue yow, or your deerest frindes

aduise yow) vpon so iuste and important causes.
            
            
               NOw that they haue brought to passe byV. pretense of parlement, that Titles of succession must no more be questioned, the time is nowe ripe, by remouing the present possessor, to intrude their newe Succession, whiche they cannot establishe whiles yow suruiue.
            
            
               VVHere as thir ambition is to reigne,VI. and ambition abideth not her due tyme nor the feare of falling: and they alreadie haue for their priuat aduancement not onlie contriued the diuerting of the Crowne from that course in whiche the lawes haue established it, but also circumuented yow, indangered your state, steined your honour, oppressed your people, impouerished your realme, and procured infinite perilles to depend ouer all: who maie doubt but that they make their accompt that it is nowe timelie furder to procede, and to satisfie their ambition by your death or depriuation.
            
            
               HAuing brought your Heighnesse to this,VII. that neither by Child of your owne bodie, nor by any heire knowne they stand inThe Q. of Scotl. D. of Norf. S. N. Throgm. feare of any Successor: and hauing also plucked of, your principall feathers by taking from yow

your trustie defences, and deerest frindes, there lieth now nothing in their waie, but when they list they maie make yow awaie, that by setting vp whome thei liste, they maie raigne securelie.
            
            
               NOw that they see the world doth perceaueVIII. the deepe discontentation they haue in their hartes of the maner of your gouernement, for which they terme yow willfull, vnruly, and in matters of most weight wote not where to haue yow▪ which by passions blustered owt in secret by them to some frindes, are now diuulgued to the realm: fearing at your handes due correctiō for such traiterous ingratitude, they think it high time to assure themselues of yow, and accompt it consciēce to bannish womens regiment, and a necessarie polecie to sett vpp a Child, vndre whom their deuises (be they neuer so wicked) maie haue more quick and speedie execution. which childe is moste likely to be first the yong Prince of Scotl. though not to raigne for any long tyme, but only that vnder that colour, the Crowne may in the eyes and iugements of the world, descende more colourablely vppon that other childe the issue of Suff. for, the La. Marg. Lineux iuste interest, they will not acknoledge.
            
            
               HAuing vndre your fauour climed to theIX. toppe of worldlie felicitie, atteyned to infinit treasures by pilling, polling and lottering

your subiectes and Realm, by briberie, piracie and iniustice euerie waie, it can not now possiblie stand with their security nor final purpose, to lend yow long life or to suffre yow to ouer liue them selfes. And being they both of good yeres and the one so owglie and deformed that he hath alreadie one foote in his graue, your Heigh. maie easelie make accompt of the short tearme of life that your selfe holdeth by: which may in no condition be longer then theirs, least their going awaie before yow and the leauing vnperfited the final execution of their dessignmentes: the prouision for their posteritie and the deriuing the Crowne to the yssue of Suff. might by your conuersion and reconciliation to the Church and Princes your neighbours (which they feare merueylouslie in your Nature and wisedom) might I saie all fall to the grownd, and their corrupt gaines come to answerre in parte, the detriments done to yow and your Realme: as of some of their Comperes in France and Flandres, they haue seene allready come to passe.
            
            
               NOw that they haue drawen vpon yow theX. terrible sentence of Excommunication, brought yow to iniurye all the Princes of the world, and with three of the chiefest to haue implacable quarell: and thereby inuolued both yow and your Realm in manifest danger of forrein inuasion: their shrewd heds perceaue, yow

haue no better remedie nor redier shift, then toThe Q. of Scotl. the principall piller of the Q. securitie. reconcile vnto your fauour the Qu. of Scotl. againe: and consequentlie by a reformation in religion to satisfie your neighbours abroad. which to preuent, they haue resolued first her death, and shortlie after your owne: least yow might be the reuenger of hers, whom they can not induce yow to hate, so deepely as they would.
            
            
               NOw that they haue brought both yow andXI. the realm into the perils aforesaid, and so long dalied yow forth from bestowing your, selfe in mariage, and so often mocked the Princes abroad, that such kinde of offres be now contempned, they haue for them selfes no bettre shift now lefte, then (when they be suer of the Prince of Scotl.) first to dispatch both yow and your Cosin his Mother: and setting the Crowne vpon one of the children, then by a treatie for mariage with one of the great kinges, to make their owne peace, and to winn them the amitie of the one or the other.
            
            
               TO cōclude Madā: Now that they haue heapedXII. vpon yow and your Realm those huge heapes of dangers and quarrells, importable for any of both to sustaine: they finde none so suer nor speedie remedie for their owne securitie, as to worke your death or depriuation, that those quarells maie die and be buried with your person,

and them selfes become free from all deserued punishment, by charging yow with their wicked gouernment 
                     •…
                   making their suer reckening, by sending of yow to your graue, they lapp vpp in your shrowding sheete, the principall subiect of all forrein quarrells, and by your death to yeald satisfaction of all forrein desire of reuenge.
            
            
               ABuse not your selfe for gods loue, with the fallible opinion and deceaueable confidence in these mens honesties, because yow haue made them of naught, but resort yow to the examples, yea rather to the experience of the insolencie, contēpt and odious ingratitude of base persons excessiuely benefited: and make not your selfe to be annombred among the infortunat, whom, others perils could not make warie. This time nor place admitteth not the allegation of manie: let these few examples therefore suffise, which our vnhappie daies haue brought to light, and finished with in the time of your owne memorie.
               Yf in France ambition made the late Admirall not only to determine, but by words also to threaten the vtter ruine of the whole howse of Valloyes (which had so lately exalted his familie from naught) for not satisfying his appetite in the support

of his faction: if in Scotl. the force of the same dyd drawe the Earle Bothwell, not onlie from his dutiful fidelitie largelie testified to the Q. and her Mother in their seuerall distresses, but also so farr forced him: as not contayning him selfe within the limits of common crimes, drew him to excede in such horror of treason, as the hart nor face of anie reasonable creature (other then of a verie spirite incarnat) could euer haue indured to conceaue, or once to sustaine the dissembled countenāce of so vyle a minde: if there also, the insatiable appetit of that humour, and the impatient feare of falling: dyd draw the Earle of murrey from all bonds of nature, honour, and gratuitie towardes his souereigne and Sister, and to contriue such terrible treasons against her, as time hath now reuealed, to haue bene so deepe, and so diuelishlie compassed, as passed almost all humane invention: yea if also the violence of that pestiferus humor hath bene such, as in some other place hath drawen the soon, to forget all regarde of nature, dutie, or other bond towardes his owne Father: if your Heigh. I saie haue seene these experiences in euerie contrey adioygning with in the late yeres of your owne reigne; shall not these suffise to admonish one of your wisedom to beware

of that partial and blinde affection, wherewith it seemeth yow are bewitched (as it were) to hold and accompt the verie contriuers of your confusion, for persons priuileged and exempted from the common infection that hath corrupted all their confederates in euerie contrey befides? namely where the principal of these. 2. your conspirators smacked so deepely therof many yeres agoe, that he ioyned him selfe full vngratefully with the aduersaries, to the ouerthrow of his own master, his maker and aduancer? And where euerie free and vnaffected sight doth alreadie manifestlie discouer the selfe qualities and like humors of inordinat ambition, impatient feare of declining, grutching murmour, and mislike of your fainte supporting their faction, and a generall repininge werinesse of your yooke and regiment to haue of a good time rancklie possessed the hartes of these Coniurators against yow, and your howse: how blinde must he be that discernith lesse to depend iminentlie ouer iow, and to be nighe hand to fall greauouslie vpon yow, then is alreadie seen by your mens mates to haue bene contriued and intended against all the Princes of the contreys about yow. which, if after this Gods gratiouse admonition, and faith

full frindes counsell, yow shall not yet preuent and prouide for, but suffre to fall on yow, yow shall with the destruction of your body, burie also your fame of all prouidence and wisedom; and remaine condempned among the infortunat, and forsaken by God as wanting all grace, and power to heare, or to see that towardes your selfe, which euerie man beheld, and yow were forwarned of.
               Your Heigh. is of deeper consideration then to iudge that this so open a detection of their treasons against you and the crowne, coulde lacke sufficient proofes, if tyme dyd serue to plead their persons guiltie. And their wisdomes can smell owt, that their secret dealinges could not thus farre come to light, but by somme whiche some tymes sit at their elbowes, and for feare of personall perill, smothelie sooth their mischeuous meaninges for the tyme, and after, for dutye to their contrey, and loue to your person, discouer them to others that be in saffer place to publishe the same.
               Yf they be not guiltie of contriued treasons against your H. why then by such fearefull and frawdulent meanes, keepe

they from your knowledge the Treatise and Table of treasons which long sithens came to their handes by moe wayes then one? Yf they can cleere them selfes to be trewe men to the Crowne, why then doe they by al possible meanes imbarre the comming to sight of suche bookes whiche set forth to the worlde the next most lawfull and right heire apparant the Queene of Scotl. but because they be guiltie of the one, and can not cleare them selfes in the other, their beste securitie and assurance (as yow haue herde) muste be, to make yow sewre, and to gett your heires into their handes: against the polecie and presidentes of all Princes securitie.
               It is an historicall obseruation that there is no suretie in suspected frindshippe, nor truste in conceaued treason. Yf these traitors lacked either witt, will, or power to bring to passe their deuised pourpos, yow might the lesse feare their fatale malice. VVhat vngratious wits they haue, their former plats so coninglie caste, declare. And who may thincke that traiterous myndes aspiring to the heighest, can want ready willes, to finishe their forward attemptes?
               
                  As for power (take awaye that they be not absolute) it is sufficient to doe whatsoeuer. For be they not mightie in moneys, treasures and allies? sit they not at the sterne? be they not in place to pen their own Commissions? haue they not all in their own haudes that may aduance their intended attemptes? what lacke they but that they looke when tyme will so tempre, as to set forward their terrible tragedies wich muste ende with the Dispatche of 3. Princes, the Q. of Scotl. her Soon, and your selfe, to the vttre confusion and ruine of a florishing Realme.
