            PRayse ye childern almyghty god as the phylosophre sayth in dyuerse places. All those thynges that haue the habyte of parfyght cognycyon may moue themself and conueye themself to theyr ende / as a beest hauynge sensyble knowlege / and man more parfyghter / bothe sensyble & Intellygyble may moue themself whether they wyll / and so conueye all theyr accyons and dedes vnto theyr naturall ende. But (carencia cognicione) Those thynges that lacke cognycyon haue no mocyon of themself / nother be dyrected to theyr ende without the helpe of an other. As an arowe of hymself can not be moued ne dyrected vnto the prycke without the redy conueyaūce of hym that shoteth / thrugh whom dyrectly he attayneth his ende & is shotte to the prycke. In as moche thenne as mankynde is ordeyned vnto an ende / ferre excedynge the lymytes of nature / as it is wryten by ye holy ghost in (Ysay .lxiiij. Oculus non vidit.

                te que preparasti exspectantibus te. Et prima ad Corintheos secundo. Oculus non vidit nec aures audiuit / nec in cor hominis ascendit que pre parauit deus diligentibus illum) The eye of a man hath not seen / nother his eeres herde / nother it can not be thought in his herte thende that almyghty god hath ordeyned

for them that loueth hym. To this ende man hauynge the vse of reason and parfyte knowlege is dyrected by his free wyll as by a pryncypall in hymself to moue hym to god. And also by fayth as a prycypall aboue naturall knowlege without the whiche it is Impossyble for to please god and attayne to the ende of grace in this present lyf and glory in heuen / as it is wryten (Sine fide impossibile est placere deo) Whyle it is so that man endowed with vse of reason / hauynge naturall knowlege and free / may not suffycyentely dyrecte hymself to the ende that god hath ordeyned to without the helpe of fayth. As it is wryten Iheremie .iiijo. (Non est enim hominis vincere ne
               
                  
                     
                  
                  que

Moche more those that ben childern for tendernesse of age and lacke of knowlege can not dyrecte theyr dedes conuenyentely to that ende without specyall helpe of god. In token herof / childern newely sette to scole lackynge the vse of reason and the habyte of cognycyon haue a recourse to goddes dyreccyon. Fyrste lernynge this. Crystis crosse be my spede. And so begynneth the (a.b.c) In wytnesse of defawte of this perfeccyon in knowlege. Pyctagoras to the dyreccyon of childern he founde fyrste this letter

in the (a.b.c.Y.) the whiche as Ysyder sayth Ethimologis is fourmed and made after the symylytude of mānes lyf. For this letter .Y. is made of two lynes. One is a ryght lyne / and the other is half ryght and half crokyd / And so verely the Infant age of a childe is ryght neyther dysposed to vertue neyther to vyce as the phylosophre sayth (Tanquā tabula nuda in qua nichil depingitur) But the seconde age is called Adolescencia / and hath two lynes a ryght and a crokyd / sygnefyenge the dysposycyon that he hath thenne to vyce and then̄e to vertue. In the whiche age is the brekynge of euery childe or to goodnes or to lewdenes. Therfore that age is moost vncertayn in knowlege as Salomon sayth (Prouerbio rū .xxxo. Tria sūt michi difficilia ad cognoscendū et quartū penitus ignoro Viam nauis in medio maris. et viam viri in adolescentia) Thre thynges sayth Salomon ben harde to me to knowe / and the fourth vtterly I knowe not. The flyght of the Egle in the ayer / The waye of the serpent on the erthe. The sayllynge of a shyppe in the see. But the fourth and moost hardest is to vnderstande the waye of a man in his growynge age / Tho childern thenne the whiche lacke dyscrecyon / vse of reason / & parfyght cognycyon / and yet attayne to the ende that is prepared for mannes blysse.

The fyrste age is lykened vnto the lawe of kynde. A childe fyrste whan he is in his Infant age is not constreyned vnto no lawes / he is not corrected nother beten / and there is no defaute layde vnto hym / but vtterly he is lefte vnto the lawe of kynde. Do he what someuer he wyll / noo man doth blame hym. Morally the state of man jnmedyatly after synne was verely the state of childehode

and Infans hauynge noo nouryce. Whan that man was vtterly left without ony expressyd lawe / hauynge no mayster to his owne naturall Inclynacyon / as to his lawe / there was no lawe of god newe put to hym / Many defawtes dyde he and to many Inconuenyences he ranne. Correccyon was there none / but vtter destruccyon / as Noes flood destroyenge alle Infantes of mankynde saue .viij. persones (Genesis .vijo.) The destruccyon of Sodome & of Gomor with other cytees (Genesis .xixo.) And lyke wyse as a childe hauynge noo nouryce nor guyder deputed to hym may as well renne in to the fyre or water as to go besyde. Soo verely in the fyrste age of man in the lawe of kynde. A man beynge without a nouryce or guyder lefte to his naturall guydynge mysused soo ferre hymselfe that he ranne to water / where he was vtterly destroyed as I sayd before / saue Noes housholde / and also to the fyre where a grete parte was destroyed. And verely maysters yf we clerely consydre our lyf and state that we stande in now in thyse dayes I fere me we shall fynde our self soo ferre guyded by our sensuall nature that we shall nede to be purefyed to our streyte correccyon with a streyte afflyccyon / as the water or the fyre / and all for lacke of our maysters and nouryces all wrapped in neclygence taketh none attendaunce to vs / Our maysters and nouryce spyrytuall (Querent

Some sayd he felle in Lombarde strete / some sayd in Buklars bury / & whan it was vtterly knowe / he was fallen in euery strete (Veritas corruit in plateis) The cause is none other but we lacke our

maysters & guyders that sholde streytly attende in this Infant age of condycyon that we ben in.
               ¶Whan that Infant age is ended / the fader prouydeth for his childe / for a mayster the whiche gyueth Instruccyon in smal doctrynes / as in his Donate. Partes of reason / and suche other / the whiche mayster comunely is called Pedagogis in latyn. This mayster gyueth cōmaundementes to the childe in his growynge age And he breke them he is sharpely corrected / there is no fawte that he doth but he is punysshed. Somtyme he wryngeth hym by the eeres / somtyme he gyueth hym a strype on the honde with the ferell / some tyme beteth hym sharpely with the rodde. And so with commaūdementes and sharpe correccyon he gyueth hym full Instruccyon in the lawer scyence. So in lyke maner after the lawe of kynde. As mankynde grewe in age / almyghty god prouyded to man an enfourmer that was called Moyses / the whiche sholde teche man his pryncypalles and small and rude doctrynes. And so the olde lawe taught to man his Donate and Partes of reason. Also he taught hym how he sholde gyue to god his partes / the whiche were sacrefyces / oblacyons / and tythes Iustely and truely to be gyuen to god / as it is wryten (Ecclesiasticis .xxxvo.. Da altissimo secundum donatum eius) That what thou sholdest gyue to thy neyghbour and broder his partes. That is for to saye / 

Almesdedes freely without grutchynge. Lenynge of thy good without ony trust or hope of vsury / & forgeuȳge thy neyghbour yf he be in necessyte with out trouble for goddes sake. And lyke wyse as the people vnder Moyses growynge in childhode / thyse thynges were taught by the whiche specyally goddes lawe & praysynge was encreaced. So in our growynge age in vertue that good lorde (cuiꝰ laus est in ecclia scō

And pyteuously forgyue offences & dettes to theym that ben nedy & may not paye. Thyse ben the thynges that longeth to goddes praysynge in mankyndes childehode / as it is wryten of Thoby (Thobie prio.

And for one grutched ayenst theyr mayster Moyses / yt whiche was but Pedagogus / the chosen woman moost accept Maria Aarons syster was smytten of god with the Infyrmyte of leprehode. How oftetymes breke we our holy daye / how oftymes grutche we ayenst our maysters / not holdynge vs contente

with noo kyng nother prynce / archebysshop nor bysshop. Beynge as varyaunt as the mone / & yet the good lorde spared vs. The olde lawe was harde to obserue / in the whiche tyme god entreated mankynde after his wrathe & punysshement / Wherfore he was called (deꝰ vlcionū) For whoos delyuer mercy cryed to almyghty god to sende mā
                  kynde a newe mayster yt sholde entreate hym and teche more curtously & it lyked hym (Non ex operibus iusticie q̄ fecimꝰ nos. sed secundū suā misericordiā. ad Titū .iijo.) To come downe hymself / & toke on hym our mortallyte / gaue vs a newe lawe / wolde suffre none but hȳ
                  selfe to be our mayster / Wherwith all loue & benygnyte without sharpenesse he taught vs. Noo rude nother grose erthely doctrynes / as they were taught in the olde lawe. But he taught vs subtyll thynges / heuenly dyuynytee / our glorye & our blysse (Docebat eos de regno dei) And as longe as we ben in the scole of mercyfull benygnytee & gentylnesse / though we do fawtes purposynge to amende. So longe he abydeth vs pacyently holdynge hymself contente / For by cause we ben now in mannes state and parfyght age with our owne correccyon (Propterea expectat deus vt misereatur vestri. Ysaye .xxxo.) And yf we dyfferre & wyll not correcte our selfe here in the scole of mercy / ful greuously & moost sharpely shall we abyde the swerde of correccyon of his ryghtwysnesse / as dayly by experyence we may fele.

Therfore in the thre ages of our lyfe lete vs besye our selfe to prayse god with pure childern. Amendynge our lyfe by dedes of penaunce. And vertuous dedes vsynge. exhortynge you with the wordes of my tyme (Laudate pueri dn̄m)
               ¶ The fourme and the maner how that we sholde worshyp and loue almyghty god in the thre ages / that is to saye. In childehode. Yongthe / and Manhode. Is shewed to vs by a prety conceyte of our comyn kalender / in euery boke of seruyce. Ye shall vnderstande that euery moneth noted in the kalender is dyuyded in thre partyes. That is to saye (Kalendas. Nonas and Ydus) ¶The fyrst daye of euery moneth is called & named Kalendas The seconde is named not Kalendas / but Quarto Quinto or Sexto Nonas. And so tyll ye come to Nonas.

Kalende is as moche to saye (Quasi colendo) For the consuetude of the Romaynes was the fyrste daye of the moneth / that is called Kalendas / falleth to solempnyse to theyr goddes Hely Iuno & Iupyter.

So verely the childehode of man is dedycate to deuocyon / thenne sette the faders the childern to scole. And thenne be they taught to serue god / & to saye grace / to helpe the preest to synge / for to be meke gentyll and lowely Thenne saye they our lady matens & ben ryght deuoute. Of whom may be verefyed that is wryten by Dauyd (Hec est generacio querenciū dn̄m) yt is the generacyon that be sely by deuocyon seke almyghty god. ¶By the seconde daye that is called Nonas I vnderstande the seconde age that is called (Iuuentus) youthe (Non dicunt
