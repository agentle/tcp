EXHORTATION VVRITten
in Latyne by Marcus Tullius Cicero,
to his brother Quintus the Proconsull
or Deputy of Asia,
wherin the office of a Magistrate
is connyngly
and wisely described.

               PRYNTED AT LONDON BY
Rouland Hall, dwelling in Golding
lane at the sygne of the three
arrowes.
1561.
         
         
            
            
            GODDRED GYLBY TO THE
READER.
            
               
                  WHERE AS MEN
are now a days here
in England glutted
as it wer with gods
worde, & therfore almost
ready to vomit
vp again ye which thei haue receyued,
lothing ye sermōs & despising
the preachers, some turning to curious
arts, & som cōtemning al artes
& sciences, som Epicures, som
Atheistes, & few or none do standforth
as fathers to vs yonglings
to byd vs folow their fotesteppes
in vertues and godlines: We the
youth of this realme are drawen
into diuers and sundrye doubtfull
wayes aud wandering bypathes,
and many of vs by pouerty and other
calamities are oppressed at
our first breathing & either know
not which way to directe our studies
or els want helpe to go forwarde
and are cut of in the fyrste

herbe accordyng to the Prouerbe.
This is one thyng also that greueth
vs: we see them that are wise
and learned altogether contemned
and despised, and thei often times
are compelled to go and seke
to the riche and noble mens houses,
but the riche wyl not come to
their houses nor greatly delyte in
their companies. And thogh thys
be some cause thatPetrus Crinitus lib. 7. 14. de honesta disciplina. Aristippus
answered to Dionisius why the
learned doe haunte the houses of
the rich and the wise many times
go & seke to the wealthy and not
they to the contrary: for that the
wise doe knowe what the riche do
want and the welthy worldlings
can not se their want, as he saith.
Yet in these our tymes we maye
find other matters that cōpelleth
thē to seke to such as be in power
& autoritie. For iniquitie doth abounde
in these latter dayes and
the pore ar oppressed by the mighty.
And as I doe here mine elders

talke. The lawes are good to right
the wronges, but lawyars do not
their duties. Iustice is good, but
the Iustyces care not for poore
mens causes. Officers are enowe
and wel prouided for in all places
but these officers vnderstand not
their office and duty or yf they do
vnderstand it, they will not do it,
& which is the worste of all, when
thei do it not, thei may not be told
of it, especially by a man that is
learned in gods worde. For what
cā he skyl of ciuil offices say these
politike officers. Thus is the rule
of all equitie openly contemned.
Therefore not seyng wherevnto
in this my youth I could direct my
studies yet neither wheri I cold be
better occupied both for mine own
learning, and for the instructiō of
such politike men as wil vochsafe
to read heathen writters, though
they regard not the scriptures: I
haue trāslated as I could into our
natiue language, the notable epistle

of that famous wise and politike
man M. Tullius Cicero vnto
his brother Quintus, wherein
iustice and the right vse of an office
is so wel and politikely described
that the politike heades may
learne therby to put good things
in practise & nede nether to be ashamed
of the authour who was a
man of singuler wisedom & great
experience, nor of the matter which
is an instruction of the Magistrate
meete for all ages: yf God
grant me any abilitie to expresse
it. Take these first fruits of mine
infācie in good part, so & you shal
encourage me to farther trauails.
My father cōmādeth me to folow
labour and to suffer others to seke
for honours. Fare you wel in
the Lorde. At London the
vii. of Iuly, the yere
of our Lord.

            The exhortacion
OF MARCVS TVLLIVS
Cicero vnto hys brother
Quintus.
            
               
                  ALTHOVGH I DID
not dout but that
both many messengers
and also fame
it self should by her
swyftnes preuente
my letters, and that thou shuldest
sooner here tell of others that the
thyrde yere was added to our desier
& to thy labour: yet I thought
it necessary that I shuld also send
thee a message of this trauayle.
For as for the former letters not
in one but in many, when as now
other men had despered of yt matter,
yet I did put thee in hope that
yu should shortly depart, not onely
that I myghte comforte thee as
longe as it myght be, with a pleasant
opinion and persuasion: but

also because I did not mistrust but
that the matter might be brought
to passe, for so muche as bothe I
my self and also the pretors were
so earnest in the cause. But now
because it is so come to passe that
neyther the Pretors wyth theyr
riches nor we wyth our diligence
can doe any good, it is a very hard
matter not to be grieued therewith:
but yet it is not meete that
our courage whych is exercised in
doing and suffering great things
shoulde be broken or cast downe
with sorrowe.Mē shuld be most sory for that vvhich cō
                  meth by their ovvn faute. And because men
oght to be most sorowful for those
thynges which are come by theyr
own faut: ther is good cause why
it shuld more grieue me then the,
for it came to passe by my faute otherwise
then yu thoght, both whē
thou tokest thy iourney and afterwarde
where by letters thou diddest
go about yt a succsessor shoulde
not be deteined to thee the firste
yere. The which matter whiles I

loke to ye sauegard of our cōfederates
whiles I resist yt impudency of
certen merchāts & whiles I desire
yt our glory shuld be augmēted by
thy vertue I wrought nothing wisely,
& specially seing ye I haue committed
this faute that the second
yeare shuld also brīg ye third. Tyhe
which thing because I confesse it
to haue ben my faut, it belongeth
to thy wisdom & humanitie to prouide
& to bring to passe that this
which was vnwisely done of, me
shuld by thy diligēce be corrected.
Now if thou do rase vp, thy selfe
more earnestli and diligētly of all
sides to get a good name so that yu
do not now striue we others but we
thi self and if thou do stirre vp thy
whole mind care thought &Desire of glory ouer cōmeth al. desire
of glorye which ouercometh all
thīgs sureli this one yere whiche
is added to thy trauell shall bothe
brīg vs ye ioy of many yeres & also
make our posterity glorious wher
fore first I desire this of the yt yu be

not dyscoraged nor discomforted
and that thou suffer not thy selfe
to be ouer whelmed wt ouer great
businesse as it were wyth a floode
but contrariwise that thou rayse
vp thy selfe and resiste it and also
that thou wyllyngly set thy shulders
agaynst the weyght of thine
affayres: For thou doest not rule
that parte of the common wealth
wherein fortune hath muche power
but yt part whych may be gouerned chiefelye by reason and diligence.
And yf I dyd see that thy
dominion and authoritie had ben
prolonged to thee whilest yu wast
occupyed by some great and dangerous
warre my heart woulde
quake: to consider that the power
of Fortune at the same tyme also
shoulde be prolonged agaynste
vs. But nowe synce yt parte of the
common wealth is committed to
thy charge in the which Fortune
either hath small oir els no parte
of rule at all: euen that which semeth

vnto me wholly to consist in
thy vertue & moderatiō of minde.
I thyncke we nede not feare any
priuy traynes of enemyes, any open
war, any rebelliō and falling
away of our felowes and confederates,
any lacke of wages or prouision
for corne, nor finally any sedicion
of the army, which haue often
chaunced to moste wise men:
that asThe Magistrate is compared to a shipmaister. shypmasters be thei neuer
so connyng can not resist the
force of ye tempest so they cold not
withstand the violence of fortune
But to thee is geuen the greatest
peace and tranquillitie taht can
be, so that it is of force inough to
ouerwhelme a shypmaister that
slepeth but a wakyng gouernour
woulde be delited therewith. For
first the prouince doeth consist of
such cōfederates as are of al kind
of men most gentle: and secōdly of
such kind of citezins as either because
thei are publicans ar ioined
vnto vs by very great frendshyp,

or els because thei ocupy marchandise
are very riche and iudge that
by the means of our consulshippe
their riches are in safetie. (But it
may be said) that euen amongest
this kind of men there are greate
controuersies many wronges are
done and waighty contentious a
rise. As though I shoulde thinke
that thou haddest nothing to do.
Yes I know that there is greate
matters to do and suche as neede
greate aduisement. But remember
that I do attribute som thing
more in this busies to aduisemēt
then to fortune for what bysynes
shal it be to bridle them which are
vnder thy gouernaunce if thou cā
               bridle
thy selfe? But let that be a
greate & hard matter vnto others
as it is very hard: yet to thee both
it hath bene allwaies very easye
yea & in dede oght to haue bene so
seing yt thy nature is such as seme
yt it wold haue ben moderat wtout
learning: but now suche learning

is ioined with the good nature as
were able to bring into order and
beautify the worst dispositiō that
euer man had. Thou truely thy
self shalt withstand the greedy desire
of mony of pleasure and of all
other things as in dede thou dost:
& then shalt thou haue any greate
to feare lest thou be not able to represse
a wicked marchant or a couetous
publicane?
            As for the Grecians when they sethee
so they wil haue the in such
admiration as they are wonte to
haue som noble man mencioned
in their chronicles or els thy wil
thinke that thou so diuine a man,
art come downe from heauen into
the prouince.
            Whyche thynges I wryte not
as thoughe I exhorted thee to doe
them but that thou shoulde reioise
that thou doest, and hast doone
them allready:
            For it is an honorable thynge to
haue hadde greate power in Asia

for the space of thre yeares and so
to haue behaued thy self that no
olde monument, no painted table
no precious vessell, no riche apparell,
no notable bondman, no
beautie of any person and finally
no bargē of mony of which thīgs
there is greate store in thys prouince
could euer bring thee from
the pathe of exacte integritie and
continence. And surely what can
be more notable or more to be desyred
then that thys vertue thys
temperaunce and moderation of
mind, shuld not be hid in the dark
but be set forth in the broad lyght
of Asia nad in the eies of a moste
noble prouince and in the eares of
al people & nations:The presence of a good officer oght not to be terrible but comfortable. in so much
as they are not made affraide by
they iourneys: they men art not
burdened with charges nor troubled
with receiuing thee: but rather
where so euer thou comest
there is incomparable ioye bothe
publikly and priuatly. for so much

as ye citie wher thou entrest dothe
seme to haue receiued a defender
and not a tyrant: the house were
thou lodgest, a gest and not a robber?
But as for these motters, vse
it self hath taught that it is not in
ough that thou thy selfe shoulde
haue these vertues but that thou
ought to loke about diligently yt
in ye preseruation of this prouince
not onely thou but also all the ministers
of thy dominion shulde be
haue them selues after the same
sort both towards our fellowes &
citizens and also to all the cōmon
welth. Howbeit thou hast such embasadours
as will haue regard of
their own worship: of whom Tubero
is the chiefe both in honour
dignitie & age: who I think (chifely
because he wryteth an history)
maye chuse many men out of hys
owne chronicles which bothe he
will and also may follow. But halenius
is our owne bothe in heart
and good will and also in following

our kind of lif. And what nede
I speake of Gratidius? Whom I
know of a suerty so to care for his
owne estimacion that for the brotherly
loue towards vs he careth
also for ours. Thou haste also a
questor which was not chosen by
thine owne iudgement but such a
one as was giuen by lot. Whō it
behoueth both of his owne accord
to be moderate: & also to obey to
thy wyll and commaundement.
Of whome yf paraduenture any
were some what couetous thou
shuld beare so long wyth hym vntill
he of his owne head did violat
those lawes to the whych he is
bounde not permitting yt he shuld
abuse to lucre and gayn yt power
which thou haddest committed to
him for honour: for surely it pleaseth
me not (chiefly seing that the
maners of this time are so muche
declined vnto so great lightnes &
ambition) that thou shouldest searche
out all filthines and examin

euery one to the vttermost but to
commit so muche to euery one of
them as he may be trusted wythal.
And amongst those whom the
commonwelth it self hath appointed
to be as fellowes and helpers
with thee thou shalt be aboue thē
only in those poīts which I haue
That is to giue euery man that vvhich he may be trusted vvithal heretofore prescribed. As for thē
whom thou hast wyth thee either
of thy householde or of the necessary
messengers whom men vse to
call as it wer of the pretors band
both the deds and also the words
of these menThe magistrate must answere both for the words and dedes of their families and train which they chuse to haue aout them. must be performed
by vs. But thou haste those men
with thee whome thou shalt haue
occasion to loue doyng wel, or els
yf they haue not respecte to thy
honour thou maist easely correct.
Of whome because thou wast vnexpart
it semed that thy good nature
might easely haue bene deceiued:
The berter a mā is the soner is he begyled for the better a man is, the
lesse he suspecteth another to be euil
But now this third yere hath

as much integritie as the two former,
yes & by experience is made
more ware and diligent.
            
               The cares of a magistrate. Let thyne eares be suche as
may be taught to heare those things
which they heare in dede, not
such as men mai whisper in salfely
and faynedly for lucre sake.
            
               The ring and signets Let not thy ring be an instrument
not regarded but as thou
thy selfe: Not a minister of another
mans pleasure but a witnes
of thy wyll.
            
               the sergeant & purseuant. Let the Purseuant also be in
that degree in which our aunceters
wold haue him which did giue
ye office not as a benefite but as a
labour & charge and dyd not rashly
commit it to any, but to them
whom they had brought to libertie,
ouer whome yet they had authoritie
litle lesse then ouer their
seruaunts.
            Let the Sergeant be a mesenger
not of hys but of thy gentlenes:
the mases. and let them beare those

mases & pollaxes rather for a sign
of dignity thē of power.The loue of subiects Finally
let it be known to al ye prouince yt
ye sauegard of ye families good name
& substāce of al men ouer whō
thou bearest rule are moste deare
vnto thee. Yea & let them thinke
on this, thatBribe giuers and bribe takers. thou wilt not only
be an enemye to them which take
bribes, but also to them that giue
bribes if thou know it. And surely
no man will giue bribes when he
doth once perceyue that nothing
can be obteyned of thee by their
meanes which make a shewe as
thogh they could do much wt thee.
Neither do my words tend to this
end that I would haue thee ether
to rigorous or suspicious against
thy officers:Of trusty officers. For if there be any
whiche for the space of two yere
were neuer suspected of thee to be
couetous (as I hear of Cesius Cherippus
& Labeo, & because I know
them I beleue it) there is nothing
which I thinke thou maist not be

bolde to commit to them or any
other of like fidelitie. But if there
be any in whom thou hast spied or
of whom thou hast perceiued any
thing: trust him with nothing nether
commit to hym any parte of
thine honor.Of newe frendes. And if yu hast found
any man in the prouince it selfe,
which is all together become thy
familier frende which was afore
vnknowen vnto vs: loke diligent
how much thou may truste hym:
not but ye ther may be many good
men in the prouince: but this mai
be hoped for to iudge it, it is dangerous.
For the disposition of the
nature of euery mā is cloked with
many foldes of dissemblyng and
couered as it were with certayne
veales: the forehead the eyes and
countenaunce wyl deceyue a man
often,The tōge of man. but the tong oftnest of al.
wherfor how canst yu find such mē
as being drawne with the lust of
many would lack all those things
frō ye which we cannot be seuered

and that should hartily loue thee
being a strunger and would not
rather seme to beare the good wil
for ther owne profit sake? It semeth
to me a great matter specially
since those men do allmoste
loue no priuat men yet that they
shoulde loue all they pretors. Of
whiche sort if thou haste knowen
any whiche loued thee more then
the time (for so it might be) reken
him gladly amongest thy friends.
But if thou shalt not be sure of yt
thee is no kind of men whose familiaritie
thou oght more toBeware of money men. beware
of because they know al the
shiftes of mony and do all things
for mony yea and care not for his
estimation wyth whom they intend
not to leade their life. yea &
amongest the Grecians som familiarities
must be auoided except of
fewe men which follow ye maners
of old Grecia. But many of thē
are so deceitfull and vnconstant &
by their longe bondage haue lerned

to muche flattery. Whom I
would all to be liberally enterteined
but a fewe of the best must be
chosen for hospitalitie and frendshippe.
Their great familiaritie
is not to be trusted (for they dare
not be against our wils) yet they
enuy both our contry men & their
owne. But now since I will be so
ware and so diligēt in such thīgs
wherein I am afraid lest I be to
hard: how thinkest thou I would
haue seruants ordred? Whom as
in all places so chiefly in the prouinces
we oght well to gouerne.
Of which kind many things may
be spoken: but this is both shortest
and may easily be kepte in memory
that they do so behaue them
selues in these iourneis in Aslya
as though they were trauailing
in the hye way called Appia And
let them think ye ther is no differēce
whither thei com to Tralles
or to Formie. And if there be any
of thy seruants very faithfulthe charg of seruants let

him haue ye ouersight of thy house
hold & priuat busines. But as for
such thinges as do apperteine to
thy office & autority or to ani part
of the common welth let him not
once medle therewith. For many
thinges wherewith faithful seruants
may be trusted yet for aduoiding
of ye speeche of people & ill
report oght not to be cōmitted to
them. But I cannot tell how my
folke is fallen to a kind of instruction
wher as in ye beginning I did
purpose no such thing. For what
shuld I instruct him whō I know
in this matter to be as wise as mi
self & by reason of vse mroe wise?
But I though yt if ye auctoritie of
my counsell were ioyned to those
thīgs which thou dost thi self thei
shoulde be more pleasant to thee.
            
               The foundacion of true honor & dignitieWherfore let these be the foundacion
of thy dignitie first thy cō
               tinence
& integrite secōdly ye sham
fastnes of all them that are with
thee (yea & loke thou very wearly

and diligently haue choise of familiarities
as wel of men of the prouince
as of the Grecians) & last of
all a graue & constant order of thy
house. Which things seing they
are comely in these our priuat &
daily orders: in so large a dominion
which hath so corrupte maners
& in a prouince that so easily
corrupteth others thy must needes
seme diuine & heauenly. This
gouernemēt & order mai vphold ye
seueritie in makinge statutes and
decrees whiche thou haste vsed in
those thinges by ye which we haue
purchased certein priuy grudges
whereof I am very glad: Vnles yu
think that I am moued with the
complaints of one Paconius whō
I knowe not what he is who is
not so good as a Grecian but rather
a Mysian or Phrygian or els
with ye words of Tuscenius a vile
and mad man out of whose filthy
mouthe thou hast gotten wt great
equitie a most shameful lust. But

we cānot snsteine these and other
things which thou hast decreed in
this prouince ful of seuerity with
out great tēperance of life. Wherfore
loke ye there be great seuerity
in iudgmētsLet not fauor peruert iudgement. so yt it be not chaunged
for fauor but yt it be kepte equall
and vpright. But surely it
shal litle preuil if yu do iustice vprightly
and diligently vnles the
same be done of thy compartners
to whom thou hast granted some
parte of yt office. And surely me
think there is no great diuersitie
of busines in gouerning Asia but
yt it doth only cōsist in giuing iust
sentence in the which the fashion
how to gouerne a prouince is euident.
Constācy Grauitie. Constancy also & grauity
muste be added which maye resist
not only fauor but also suspicion.
            
               Loue. Humanity Diligence. Whereunto must be ioined promptnes
to heare gentilnes in discerning
& finally diligence bothe
in making and giuing answer &
also in reasoning. For these thīgs

friende was not lightly wont neither
without a cause to lay out of
his hands for ther is no deinty of
a diligent & moderat gouernemēt
in them omitted. If Cyrus who
knew he shulde neuer be a priuat
man so diligently obserued these
things wt what care oght they to
kepe & obserue them which beare
rule with this conditiō that they
must depart from it againe and returne
vnder obediēce of those lawes
by order of ye which the goueruaunce
was committed vntothē?
The felicitie of the subiectes is the ende of gouernement. And surely me thinketh yt thys
oght to be ye end of all things that
the rulers shuld do. Namely that
they which be vnder their dominion
maye be as happy as is possible:
which thing is greatly commended
both by true report & also
by all mens talk ye thou dost chiefly
esteme it & hast so euer sence yu
camest first īto Asia. And it is surely
yt office not only of them which
beareth rule ouer ye confederates

and citizens of Rome but also
of him which hath ye charge of seruants
yea and of dome beastes to
care for ye profit & vtilitie of them
ouer whom he beareth rule. And
I perceaue ye all men doe agree yt
in such kind of things thou art as
diligent as may be & that ye cities
are charged wt no new debte nor
impost but yt many townes ar by
thee discharged of their old debte
which was both great & greuous
yea ye many which were fallen in
decay & almost desolat are by thee
restored of whō there is one most
citie of Ienia & an other of Caria
Samus & Halicarnassus: & yt ther
is no dissension nor discord in the
cities: & that yu dost prouide that ye
cities be ruled by ye counsel of the
nobles: that ye robberies of Mysia
are taken away & murders in many
places are stopped & caused to
cease & that peace is established ī
the whole prouince & not onely ye
those theftes which were cōmitted

by ye way side & in the fields arceased
& put away but also many
mo & greater theftes & murthers
which were cōmitted in cities: &
that false accusation which is the
most cruell seruant of the pretors
couetousnes is taken away & remoued
from ye same & from goods
and from ye welthy quietnes of riche
men: yt the costes & tributs of
the cities are equally susteimed of
all which inhabut ye borders of ye
said cities: ye one may easely haue
acces to thee yt thy eares are open
to ye complaintes of all men ye no
mans pouerty or misery is not only
not shut out from ye common assemblies
& from thy iudgement
but not so much as from thi house
and priuy chamber: & finally ye in
thy hole dominion ther is nothīg
greuous nothing cruell and that
all things are full of clemēcy meknes
& humanity. And surely how
great a benefite is it ye thou haste
deliuered Asia (thogh we susteine

great grudge) from ye iniust & greuous
tribut for & publike buildings?
for if one noble man doe
complain openly yt thou haddest
taken from him two hundred .M.
pence because yu haddest cōmaunded
yt mony shuld not be appoynted
for commō places: how much
mony then shuld be paid if mony
shuld be laid out for all them which
make plaies at Rome ye which
thing was also ordeined? Howe
be it we haue suppressed these cō
               plaints
of our citizens moued we
this counsell which I cannot tell
how it is praised in Asia but at
Rome it is had in no smale reuerence:
because yt where as ye cities
had decreed mony for our churche
and monument which thing thei
had doone of their owne accorde
both because of my great desertes
and also for thy great benefytes:
The magistrate may take mony of the subiectes for the building of tē
                  ples and monumentes. yea & ye law dyd specially except
that it shoulde be lawfull to take
for a church or a monument and

because that whyche was giuen
should not perishe but shoulde remaine
in ye ornaments of ye church
so yt it should haue semed to haue
bene giuen not so much to me as
to the people of Rome and to the
immortall Gods? yet I thought
that that in ye which the dignity
yt law yea and the will thē which
did it, did consist, ought not to be
receaued bothe for other causes
and also that they to whome it
was not dewe nor lawfull might
beare it more willīgly.The gouernour must be careful both for religion and iustice to make the people blessed. Wherfor
labour with all thy mind and diligence
to kep ye trade which thou
haste as yet vsed that thou liue &
by al meanes defend them and study
that they be as blessed as may
be whom the senat & the people of
Rome haue committed to thy power
& fidelitie and of whom they
haue giuen thee charge. And if so
be yt by lot thou haddest ben made
ruler of Africa or of Spaine or of
france which are fearce and barbarous

people: yet it were a part
of thy humanity to prouide for
their commodity & to loke to their
health and profit. But since we
beare rule ouer yt kind of men in
whom not only humanity to selfe
is but also from whō it is thought
to haue proceded to others we
oght specially to shew humanitie
to them of whom we receiued it
for I will not be ashamed to say
this (chiefly in that maner of life
and in those noble actes in which
there can no suspicion of sluggishenes
or of lightnes remaine) yt
we haue obteined these thynges
which we haue gotten by those artes
and studies which were giuē
vs by moniments and doctrines
of Grecia.Practise humanitie to vvards thē of vvhō vve learne it. Wherefore besides ye
common loyaltie & fidelitie which
is due to al mē we seme to owe
it chiefly to these men yt by whose
precepts we haue bene taught among
them we shoulde set forthe
those things which we haue learned
of them. And surely Plato the

prince both of wit and learnng
thoughtWhē shal realmes be blessed & happy. that then common welthes
shuld be happy when either
learned and wise men beginne to
gouerne them or els when they
which did gouerne thē did bestow
all their study in learning and in
wisdome. For he thought ye thys
ioining to gether of auctoriti and
wisdome was the preseruation of
cities which thing perchance happened
to all our common welthe
but nowe surely it is chaunsed to
this thy prouince that he shoulde
beare chief rule therein, who had
bestowed much time and diligēce
euen from his youth in learning
vertue and humanity. Wherfore
see that this yere which is added
to thi labor may also seme to haue
ben added to the welthe of Asia:
for Asia was more happy in reteining
thee thē we were in leading
thee of thy iourney from vs but
bring thou to passe that oure earnest
desire mai be mitigated with
the ioyfull remembrance of ye prouince:

for seīg thou hast ben more
diligent then any man in deseruing
that so great honours shuld
be giuen thee, as I know not whither
they were giuen to any besides,
thou must nedes be a greate
deele more diligent in mainteining
these hounours. Howbeit I
wrote to thee heretofore what I
did iudge of this kind of hounors.
The right iudgemēt of honors. I thought them allwais yf
they were common to be vile: yf
they were rodeined by necessitie
of time light: but if they wer giuē
for thy deserts (as it is come to
passe) I thought that thou oghtest
to be very diligent in mainteining
of them: wherefore seing in
those cities thou hast ye chiefe rule
and power in ye which thou seest
the vertues consecrated and set
in the nomber of the goddes thou
must remember in al things which
thou doest ordeine, which thou
dost decree, and what soeuer yu dost
what thou owest to so gret hope
which men haue conceiued of the,

likewise tot he iudgements of mē
and finally to so gret honours.
The which office is such yt thou
mist care for all men that yu geue
remedies for the discommodities
of men and prouide for their wel
th, as thou woldest both be called
and counted the parente of Asta.
But to this thy will and diligēce
the publicanes are a greate hindrance:
whom if we resist we shal
seperate from oure frendship that
company whiche hath doone very
muche for vs and whiche by vs is
ioined to the common welthe and
not onely from our frendship but
from the commō welthe also: but
if we do in all points suffer them
we shall suffer them vtterly to
perishe for whose sauegard not only,
but also for their profite we
oght to care. This is the onelye
difficulty, if we wil wey it a right
that is in all thy dominion: for a
man to be continent to bridle all
his lustes to kepe vnder his owne
housholde and to obserue equitie

in iudgement to shew himself readie
to consider sutes to heare men
and to admit to his speach is more
glorious then harde. For it consisteth
not in any labor but in that
a man can finde in heart to do it.
The publicans and tolle gatherers are commōly extorcioners. As for that busines of the Publicans
how greuous it is to our felowes
we vnderstand of the citizens
which in pleding that ye tole
shoulde be taken out of Italy dyd
not so much complayn of the tole
as of certain iniuries done by the
tole gatherers. Wherefore I am
not ignorant what doeth chaunce
to our felowes in those far countreys,
since I haue heard in Italy
the complayntes of our citizens.
In this case so to behaue thy selfe
yt thou mayst both satisfie ye publicans
(specially seyng the thinges
of the cōmon wealth are but lately
recouered) and not suffer our felowes
and confederates to perish
requireth a diuine vertue whiche
is thine. And first of al as for that
which is most greuous to the Grecians

yt thei are tributaries ought
not to seme so greuous forsomuch
as before they were subiect to the
people of Rome by their own ordinances
thei were so. As for the
name of a publican thei can not reiect
it seing that wtout a publican
thei cold not pay ye tribute which
Silla did equaly apoint thē. Yea &
it mai be wel knowen yt ye greciās
are no gētler in gatherīg of their
tributs thē our publicās by this ye
al ye Cauniās now of late fled out
ye iles, which wer assigned of Silla
to ye Rodiās, to ask helpe of ye senat
desiring rather to pay tribute
to vs then to ye Rodiās: wherfore
nether oght they to abhorre ye name
of publicās which wer alwais
tributaries: nor thei reiect it which
cold not of them selues pay tribute:
nor thei refuse it which dyd
require it. Yea & let Asia remēbre
this thing yt if it wer not holdē vp
wt this gouernmet yt it shuld lacke
no miserie which cā com either by
war wt farren naciōs or yt comethby

inwarde discordes.vvherfore tribute is geuen. But seing
that this gouernment cā not be retained
wtout tribut let her willīgly
be cōtent for a litle part of her
fruts to redeme perpetual peace &
quietnes. And if so be yt thei cā willingly
abide ye name & cōpanye of
publicās all other things which yu
dost by coūsel & wisdom shall seme
more easy to thē: yea & thei mai in
making oft their berges haue respect
not to ye law of ye Censors but rather
to ye cōmoditie of doing their:
busines & to ye deliuerāce frō grief,
yea & yu maist do yt which yu also hast
done very wel & at this time dost,
to wit, that yu tel thē what dignity
is in ye publicans & how much we
are doūd to that cōpany that settyng
asyde authoritie and force of
powre & scepter yu maist ioyne the
grecians and publicans together
in fauour & authoritie. Yea & desire
this of thēfor whō tho haste
done so much, & which are bound
to thee in all thinges that they byt
their gentlenes woulde suffer vs

to kepe & preserue yt frēdship which
we haue wt the publicās: but what
do I exhort to thee these thinges
which yu canste not onely of thyne
owne accorde do wtout any mans
teaching but also hast for the most
part already done thē? For most honest
& the greatest felowships doe
not cease dayly to thanke vs: the
which thing was therefore more
pleasant to me because that ye grecians
do it. But it is a hard matter
to ioyne those things together
in one accord which are diuers in
cōmodities in profite & almost by
nature. And surely I haue writtē
those things which are writtē aboue
not to teach thee (for thy wisdom
nedeth no instruction of any
man) but the rehearsal of thy vertew
when I wrote dyd delyte
me: Althoughe I haue longer
in these letters then I woulde or
then I thought I shuld haue bene
There is one thing which I wold
not cease to cōmaūde thee nor will
suffer thee so much as in me lyeth

               A prayse vvith an. exceptation. to be praised wt an acception: for
all that come out of thy prouince
do so report of thy vertue integritie
& humanitie ye in thy greatest
prayses they except, only wrathe:
the which vice as it semethWrathe the signe of a light mynde. to be
ye point of a light & vnstable minde
in a customable & priuate kinde of
life:Nothing is more vncomely thē to ioyne bitternes of nature to authoritie. so nothing is more vncomely
then to ioyne bitternes of nature
to hie authority: wherfore I
wil not now vndertake this to declare
vnto thee those thīgs which
are spoken of most wise men concerning
wrath both because I wil
not be ouerlonge & also because yu
maist easly know it by many mēs
writings. Neither thinke I yt we
ought to let passe that which is ye
propertie of a letter, to wit, yt we
let him to whom we write know
those things whereof he is ignorant.
Yea and al bring vs word of
this that there is none more pleasant
then yu whē angre is absent:
vvrath. banisheth all humanrte. but if any mans wickednes and
peruerse maners doe moue thee

then yu art so angry yt all men find
lack of humanity in thee: wherfor
seing we ar com into this kind of
liuing not so much for desire of glory
as by ye thīg it self & by ye course
of fortune that ye posteritie shulde
alwais talk of vs: let vs beware as
much as in vs lieth & asmuche as
we cā do yt no notable vice be reported
to haue ben in vs. Neither yet
go I about this (which as in al ages
so especially in our age it is a
hard matter) to change ye mind & if
any thing be thorowly growne in
our maners suddēly to pluck it away:A remeady agaynst vvrath.
but I do admonish thee here
of yt if yu cāst not altogether auoide
this vice because angre doth take
place in thy mind before ye reason
cā prouide for it: that yu shuld afore
prepare for thy self & euer more remēbre
that yu must resist wrath: &
when as it doth moste moue thee
then yu oghtest most diligently to
Rule thy tonge. bridle thy tonge: whiche semeth
somtimes to be no les vertue then
not to be angrie at al, for to be angrie

is not only a point of grauity
but somtime also of gētlenes: but
to tēper ye mide & talke whē a mā
is angrie or les to kepe silēce & to
hold in thine own powre ye mociō
of thi mīd & grief, although it is not
yt point of perfit wisdō it is a point
of no final wit: & herin thei bring
word yu art much more easly & gentle:
nether do we hear of any more
greuous mociōs of yt minds or despitful
words which ar both far distāt
frō lerning & humanitie & also
cōtrary to auctoritie & dignitie for
if the wrath can by no meanes be
appeased it is to great bitternes:
but if it mai be easely entreated it
is great lightnesOf two euils the lesse is to be chosen. which for al ye
(as choise mai be in euill things)
It is better to be to gētle then to cruell. ought to be chosen before bitternes.
But because in the first yere
there was muche talke of this I
thinke because that ye iniueries of
men their couetousnes & pride did
chance cōtrary to thine opinion &
did seme intollerable: & the secōde
was much more gentle because yt
               
both custom & reasō & (as I thinke
euen my letters) did make thee pacient
& gentle:An olde officer muste so growe in vertue that he must be altogether fauteles. as for ye third yere
it oght so to be amended yt no mā
maye haue occasion to rebuke the
least thing yt may be. But now I
do not handle the matter wt thee
by ye way of exhortaciō & precepts
& teaching but by brotherly prayers
that yu wouldest set thy whole
minde care & thought to gather &
win ye praise & cōmendation of all
men on euery side. Now if so be yt
our matters stode ī ani mean state
of talk & cōmendation: I would require
no notable thīg norani thīg
of thee aboue the cōmon custom.
But now because of the dignity &
greatnes of those things in ye which
we haue ben occupied vnles we
get wōderfull great praise of this
prouince I cā not se how we cā auoide
wōderful great rebuke and
shame, for such is our state that al
good men do both fauour it & also
require & loke for al diligence and
vertue at our hāds: but al wicked

men because we haue takē in hād
a perpetuall battell against them
wold be content vpō very smal occasion
to put vs to rebuke. Wherfore
since yt this stage wherevpon
we stād is filled wt the celebrity of
al Asia, & in quātitie is ye greatest
in iudgement, the best learned, &
by nature so far soūdyng that the
voices & signes ar broght to rome
I besech thee labour & do thy diligēce
that yu may not only seme to
haue ben worthy those things but
also to haue ouercom al things by
thy cunning. And because that I
amōg other kinde of officers haue
obteyned ye administration of the
common wealth in the citie, and
thou the gouernaunce in a prouince,
although my parte do geue
place to no man, yet loke that thy
part ouercome all other: remember
that we do not striue of ye glory
that remaineth & is loked for,
but for that that is gotten already
which was not so necessary to
haue bene desyred as it is mete it

should nowe of vs be mainteined.
And if so be that I might be seperate
frō thee in any thing I wol
desire no more then this state which
I haue already obteyned. But
nowe the matter goeth so that vnlesse
all thy wordes and dedes doe
agre with the thynges which we
do. Here I shall thynke my selfe
to haue gotten nothyng by my so
great labours and so greate dangers
of all the which thou haste
bene partaker. But seyng thou
aboue all others hast helped vs to
get great renowne: surelye thou
ought to labor aboue all others to
preserue the same. For thou must
not only haue the estimaciōs and
iudgemēts of those men which ar
now liuing, but also of thē which
shalbe hereafter.We iudge more equally of them that are departed because towardes thē enuy ceaseth. How be it their
iudgemēt shalbe more right seing
it is fre frō slaunder & il wil. Finaly
yu ought to thinke thus yt thou
doest seke glorye not only for thy
selfe: ye which thyng though thou
diddest yet thou wouldest not contemne
it, especiallye seyng that

thou hast consecrated the memory
of thy name amongest wonderful
great monuments. But this thy
glorye must be communicat with
me, yea and deliuered to our children.
Wherin thou must beware
lest if thou be negligent thou doe
not only seme to haue cared lytle
for thy self, but also to haue enuied
thy frēds & kinsfolk. Nether do
I say this yt my words shuld seme
to awake thee which afore diddest
slepe but rather to haue pricked
thee forward which afore didst run
for yu wilte always do that which
thou haste done, that al men may
prayse thy iustice, temperancie,
seueritie and integritie.
            But an infinite desire of glory doeth
wholly possesse me for the singular
loue which I beare to thee.
Howbeit I thinke thus yt Asia is
now as wel knowē to thee as euery
mā knoweth his own house, &
since yt to thy great wisdō so good
experiēce is ioyned I thinke there
is nothing which doth appertaine

to praise which thou dost not wel
se & which thou dost not daily very
well remēbre wtout any mans exhortacion.Loue causeth longe letters.
But I because yt whē
I reade thy letters me thynke I
speake wt thee, am most delited we
thy longest letters & I am oftē times
very lōg my self in writing.
Now last of al I desire and exhort
thee to this thatGood officers muste be like good poetes. as good poets &
as cūning plaiers do so that thou
in the last part & cōclusiō of thine
office and busines be as diligent
as may be that this thirde yere of
thy gouernmēt may seme to haue
ben most perfect & most adorned as
though it were the thirde act in a
comodie, the which thinge yu shall
easly bryng to pas if yu thinke yt I
(whom alone yu rather dost please
then al others) am al wais wt thee
and present in al things which either
thou dost or sayest. Now it remaineth
to desire thee that if thou
loue me & wouldest haue al thyne
to doe well thou haue regarde to
thine owne health and welfare.
            FINIS.
