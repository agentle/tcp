Some fell by the wayes side.
            
            
               IN my laste
sermō (moste
noble audience)
enteringe
thys pece of
the parable
wheras our Sauiour Christ
saith ye sume of the sede fell by
the waies syde:Matthe xiij. a. Marce. iij. a. Luke. viij. a. I promised ye
declaraciō of fower thinges.
            
            First what was ment by
this worde waye. Secondarely
what it was that hath
so hardened, that thing which
is fygured by this word way.
Thirdly what seede it is that
hath bene lost in this way.
            And fourthly what byrdes
they be and what men they be
that hath deuowerid, & trodē
thesame seede. Of the two
first pointes I saied somwhat
my mynde the last tyme whan
I was in this place. And I
am come at this presēt to perfourme
my promes touchyng
the two latter pointes. Wherof
the first is, touchyng what
seede it is that hath bene lost
in this way. For declaraciō
whereof ye shall vnderstande
that it is the doctrine of the

heuenly banket wher wt our
heauenly father fedeth all his
elect and chosen people wyth
the verye bodye and bloud of
hys sonne our Sauioure Iesus
Christ, which doctryne is
so necessary, that without the
comfort thereof it is impossyble,
yt any man shoulde be sauid.
            It is not ynough for a man
to haue a knowledge of thys
doctryne: but also so many as
shalbe sauyd, must haue a practyse
and a lyuely felynge of it
in hys harte, and a pleasaunt
tast of the swetnes of this heuenly
comfort. The scripture
sayth not that he whych knoweth
the doctryne of eatynge
of Christes flesh and drynkyng
of hys bloude shalbe sauyd,
but it sayth.

               Nisi ederitis et biberitis.Ioh. vi.
               
(that is) onles ye haue ye acte
of eatyng of Christes fleshe &
of drynkinge his bloude.
            Non habetis uitam in uobis.
            Ye haue no lyfe in you, So yt
here is not only a knowledge
& an vnderstandinge, but also
an acte & a worke required at
euery mans hand. Forasmuch
therefore as it standeth vpon
euery mans saluacion & dampnaciō
euerlastingly to haue or
lacke ye inward felyng of this
comfort, it is very expedient &
necessarye that all suche as be
called to thys offyce of preaching
goddes most holy word
should instruct & leade euery
man into the trew knowlege
thereof especially for yt it is a
doctrine whiche hath not ben
receaued, but ben a loste & cast

away sede vpon ye most sortes
of people thus many yeres.
            Therfore for declaracion of
this doctrine of the heauenly
banket, ye shall vnderstande
that it is our heauenly father
whiche make the this heauenly
banket as it appeareth by
the parable in the 22. of Mat.
and the 14. of Luc.Matthe xxij. a. Luke. xiiij. b. Apoca. xix. b. And so
so desirouse he is to haue all
men come and fede vpon thys
banket, that after his preparacion
of all thinges in a readines,
he sendeth fourth his seruaūtes
to bydde not some mē
only, but al mē to come to hys
feast. And euē as ther is no liberal
harted gentelman yt maketh
a feast but he is desirous
ye his gestes should haue a lusting
gredy & hungry stomake

Euen so our heuenly father is
desierouse, that al men which
are bydden to thys feast shuld
haue hungringe & thurstinge
stomakes.Nota. But here ye muste
note yt as this bāket whervnto
our heuēly father byddeth
vs, is a banket for our soule &
not for our body, euen so must
thys hungrynge & thursting,
be hunger and thurste of the
soule and not of the bodye:
Wherefore it is conuenyente
that fyrst and foremost I declare
vnto you, how the soule
of mā is made hungry & thursty,
& also when it is hungry &
thurstye. Whiche lesson shall
geue a great lyght to all the
rest of our purpose.
            For declaration whereof
ye shall vnderstande that the

soule of man is made hungry
and thurstye by the meanes
and workyng of the law, and
that after thys sorte as I shal
declare vnto you.
            The law worketh foureRo. iij. b vij.
thynges for and in the soule
of man, Fyrst and formost theGal. iij. Heb. vij.
law maketh the soule of man
knowe and see her offences
and synnes committyd and
done againste the mayestye
of almighty god. And it sheweth
them as lyuely to the eyei. Co. xiij. Iac. i. c.
of the soule, as a glasse sheweth
the spotes and markes of
mans face vnto hys bodylye
eye. And if the lawe did not
shewe to our soules, oure synnes
after thys sort, we should
not know that we be synners
(as Saint Paule witnesseth

to the Romayns.
            
               Peccatum non cognouissem nisi per legē,
            
            I had not knowen synne butRo vij. b
by the law. Therfore is
thys one office and worke of
the lawe to make mans soule
knowe here offences.
            The seconde thynge that
the law worketh for the soule
of mā is, that it sheweth vnto
mā goddes displeasure & goddes
punishement for synne, &
euerlastinge death & hell fyer
for her offences. Stipendium peccati
mors ye reward of syn is death.Ro. v. b. vi. c.
            
            The third office & worke
of the law is to make man dispaire
quiet of hym selfe. For
when the law of God hath geuen
thus muche knouledge to
the soule of mā, then doth mās
soule begyn, to dispaire and to

thinke verely that there is no
way with her but one which is
euerlasting damnacion.
            Now when mans soule seeth
her self in such great daunger,
then is man in a wonderfull
agony and sorow, & quiet
out of all comfort, and is driuē
to seeke som other meanes for
helpe then at the hādes of the
law whiche sheweth no mercyDeut. xxvij. c. xxviij. b. Ie. xi. a.
but extreme punishment. And
for this forssyng that the lawe
straineth man with al, the law
is called pedagogus ad christū
a sholemaster whiche teacheth
man to goo to christ for helpe &Gal. iij.
this is the fourth office of the
lawe but all men cannot by &
by se christ in this agony, mās
nature is so naturally by reason
blinded ye first man seketh
all other means for helpe and

comfort before it seke for the
true and right helpe. For declaracion
whereof ye shall vnderstande
that when mannes
soule seeth her selfe in suche
daunger, first and formost peraduenture
man will fall to abstinence
frō this or that kynde
of meate, and once or twice a
weeke, or els at some such time
in the yere whē as ye pleasantenes
of the bloud increaseth
see whether he can pacify God
the father, by that meanes for
that thing wherwith the law
doth charge his conscience or
not. But the law replieth vnto
hym and telleth hym that that
abstinēce whiche he now vseth
wil not satisfie and make amē
               des
for his former offendyng
almighty God. And ye law telleth

him that in absteining now
he doth no more but his duty.
For if absteining from this or
that kynde of meate were acceptable
in the sight of God for
it self, then shoulde man bee alwayes
bound to asteine from
this or that kinde of meate, because,
yt man is alwaies bound
to doo that thinge whiche is
acceptable in the sight of God.
And so man doing that thyng
whiche semeth to hym acceptable
in the sight of almightie
God, doth nothing els but his
dutie. So that this abstinence
now can not bee a recompense
for his former offenses. Then
the soule of man beyng thus
thwartid and charged by the
law doth remayne and stande
still in her former feare, thynkynge

verely that she shallbe
dāpned not withstandinge al
here abstinence. Well when it
wil not be this way thē peraduenture
this soule of man moueth
hym to weare a shirte of
hayre or to weare no lynnen
next his body or to lye wtoute
a bed vpon the ground eyther
in straw only or vpon ye harde
stones or elles to forsake the
company of men and to go into
wyldernes, or elles to wyppe
and beat wyth roddes and
scourges that body whyche
hath offended & hath brought
hym in to suche distres and
misery:
            All thys notwythstandinge
the lawe layeth dampnacion
to mennes charge,Ro. vij. and
telleth man that he is a sinner

thoughe he haue committed
but one synne, And
that he is not onely bounde
to haue so muche care for him
selfe onely and for hys owne
saluacyon, but he must haue
the lyke care for the saluacyon
of the soule of hys brother,Mat. v.
yea euen of hys very
enemy, by meanes whereof
man standeth still in hys comfortles
estate consyderynge
his negligence eyther in that
or elles in sum other poynt.
            When all thys wyll not
serue then falleth man to aske
counsell, and here almightye
God knoweth that it is most
mennes chaunces to lyghtei. Reg. xxviij.
vpō naughty counsellares, for
when man commeth to hys
ghostly father as they cal him

haue hys conscyence loused
from those boundes wherein
the law hath boūd it, The byshopp,
person, vycar, paryshe
prieste, or other vsuall mynisters
therevnto appointed,
commonly hath not the keye
of knowledge, wherewith to
open and lose theresaied consciences,
and delyuer them
from the charge of the lawe,
And therfore of custome such
blind counsellars, which men
cal confessors, send man being
in this agony, to fasting, praiyng,
and geuing of almes, &
to other workes of mannes
owne handes. But allwaye
the lawe is at hande and telleth
man that thys can be no
satisfaction for ye former offenses,
For in so doing he doeth

nothinge els, but his dewtye
if it stand with Goddes glory.
When all thys wyll not serue
man is so afraid of almightye
God, that he dareth not goo
immediatly vnto him for help,
but thinketh that he shall find
more mercy at S. Peter his
hand or S. Paules hande, or
S. Iames hād, or S. Iohns
hand, or at the blessed virgin
Maries hande, then at the
hande of allmightye God, by
meanes whereof man falleth
on callinge vpon some or many
of them trustynge to haue
some help that way. But whē
man perceaueth not that way
to be alowed in scripture, but
in consyderyng fyndeth that
thys comminge fyrst to sayntes
before he commeth to god,

semeth rather to include a distrust
in allmightie god, then
to be a frut of a suer belefe in
him, still she remaynet in hys
former agony & vnquietnes,
and harkeneth to the saynge
of Saint. Iohan.
            Si dixerimus quia peccatiū non habemus
mendaces sumus & ueritas in nobis non est.i. Ioh. i.
            
            Yf we say that we haue no
synne we belyars and ther is
no truth in vs. Thus
mans soule travellith from
one devise to another devise,
and so to the thyrd, & so to the
fourth and so forth serchinge
if she can helpe herself or not.
And in conclusion she perceaueth
well yt she can not helpe
her self with all ye wittes that
she hath. Euen as a man who
by chaunce is fallen into a

deepe drye pyt farr frō succor
cā not by any meanes possible
help him selfe out onles, some
mā come with some ladder or
other instrument to help him
out: desiereth to be deliuereid
oute of the pit, but by his own
wit he can not tell how: euen
so ye soule of man desiereth to
be deliuerid of this sorowfull
agony, but she cā not tell how.
This earnest desier yt the soul
of man hath to be made rightuouse
again when she is fallē
from god by synne is the .iiij.
office & working of the lawe.
And it is called in scripture ye
               Psal. xiij.
hungring & thurstinge of the
soule. And yt thing which doth
satisfye that desier, and doeth
comfort the soule in this agony
is called in the scrypture

meate and drynke,Ioh. vii because of
the symylytude and lyklyhod
that it hath wyth meate and
drynke. For euē as that thing
which comforteth the desyrefull
body in extreme hunger
and thurst is callid meate and
drinke. Euen so ye same thinge
whych comforteth the desierfull
soule in this extreme agony
and miserie is called meat
and drinke.
            So doth our sauiour Christ
him self in the fift of Mathew
& in the sixt of Luke.Mat. v.
               Luk. vi. Terme
and name the desyer of the
soule, calling this desyer hungryng
and thursting in these
wordes.
            Beati qui esuriunt & sitiunt iustitiam,
quoniam ipsi saturabuntur.Mat. v.
            
            Happy be they that hunger

and thurst for rightuousnes,
for they shalbe fylled: By the
whyche wordes it is euydent,
yt Christ calleth the desyering
of the soule for rightuousnes
a hungring and a thurstynge.
So is this desier called hungringe
and thurstinge in sundry
other places of the scrypture.
As the desier to heare
Gods words, is called hunger
in the .viij. of Amos.
            Mirtam famem in terram, non famem panis,
ne
                  
                     
                  
                  que
               
               Amos. viij. sitim aquae, sed audiendi uerbum
Domini.
            I will send a hunger into
the earth, not a hunger for
bread, but a hunger for hearing
of the word of the lorde.
Here ye see that the desier to
heare Goddes worde is called
hunger. And in the, 55. cha.
of Esai.
            
               
Omnes sitientes, uenite ad aquas, Venite
emite abs
                  
                     
                  
                  que
               
               Esai. lv. argento.
            Al ye yt be thyrsty come to the
waters,Eccls. lv come & bey it wythout
money. Thyrsting in this
place is a desier of comforte &
saluation. And also in the first
of Luke. in the hymne of the
blessed virgin Mary.Luk. i. v
               
                  
                     〈…〉
                  
               
            
            Esurientes impleuit bonis, & diuites dimisitinanes.
            He fylled them that were
hungry with good thinges,
That is to say, he satisfied the
desier of them, which instructed
them selfes and ther own
worckes, and dyd put there
hole truste in him onlye. But
contrarywyse, suche as dyd
put some trust in themselues,
and were not so desierouse of
Christ, as the other were, not

so hungry as the other were,
them he sent away empty, leuynge
them to themselues.
And in the seuenth of Saynt
Iohn.Ioh. vij. This desier is likened
to a thurstynge.
            Si quis sitiat, ueniat ad me & bibat.
            If any mā be a thirst, that is to
saye, if his soule be desierouse
to haue remission of synne, let
hym come to me and dryncke.
And also in the .21. chapter of
the Apocalypse.
            Ego sitienti dabo de fonte aque uite.Apo. xxi
            
            A will geue to him that is
thyrsty the water of lyfe. By
all these places it is playne,
that ye desier which the soule
of man hath to haue forgeuenes
of her synne, is called in
scripture hungring and thurstynge.
            
               
Now then agayn, the scripture
calleth that thing which
doth comfort and satisfye this
desier of the soule, meate and
drynke. And when the soule
of man hath that same thinge
geuen vnto her that she desiered
and longed for so sore, thē
is she fed. For a profe where of
Mathew and the reste of the
Euangelistes doeth vse these
termes, faturabuntur, & aqua
& cibus. And in the .4. of S.
Iohns Gospell.Ioh. iiii. Christe was
desierouse to satisfy the wyll
of his father, and he called the
satisfyenge of that desier hys
mete.
            Meus cibus est, ut faciam uoluntatem patris
mei.
            My metes (sayeth he) is to
doe the wyll of my father. His

hunger and his thurst that he
had, was the desier that he
had to doe the will of hys father:
And the doing of it, was
his meat and drynke, as it appeareth
before in this texte,
when as answering to hys disciples
he said,
            Ego habeo alium cibum comedendum, quem
nos nescitis.
            I haue other meate to eat,
whych ye know not.
            Thus farre I haue declared
vnto you, most noble audyens,
howe the soule of man
is made hungry and thurstye
by the workynge of the lawe,
And also howe that thynge
whych doth satisfy this desier
of the soule, is named in the
scrypture mete.
            Lett vs now then procede

to the declaracion of the heauenly
banket, wherby our heauenly
father doth feed & comfort
the soule of man whyche
is made hungry and comfortles
by the lawe.
            When our heauenly and most
mercyfull father perceaueth
yt his law hath wroughte her
feat in the soule of man, and
hath brought man euen to very
desperacyon.
            Ad inferos ducit & reducit.
            Then he feedeth and comforteth
mans soule & soweth the
seed of saluation vpon him in
thys wyse. Here I muste
desier you to licence me most
noble audience to change my
parson, & to speake in ye name
of god the father, who calleth
al men to feed & comfort there

hungre & thursty soules with
such meat & drinke as he hath
prepared in his most heauenly
banket for them. Thus
saith our heauenly father to yt
man & all men whiche be comfortles
and afrayed of eternal
dampnation for ther offenses.
Man dispaire not for thy synnes
that thou haste cōmitted.God the father speaketh to the solue of man.
Folow my counsel & although
thy synnes be neuer so greate
and manyfolde, yet shall they
not dampne the. Be sory for
thyne offenses, euen from the
botom of thyne hart and purpose
earnestly to amende thy
former lyfe, & beleue that my
sonne Christe Iesus hath taken
the paynes vpon hym,
that thou hast deseruid for thy
synnes, and thou shalt not be

dampned, but thou shalt haue
life euerlasting. Let his death
ease thy stomake, comfort thy
fearfull and sorowefull hungringe
soule with the punyshing
of hys body, and the sheding
of hys preciouse bloude.
And euen as meat doth comfort
thy body, when it is hungry,
& drinke when it is thursty,
euen so let hys punishmēt,
comforte thy soule, For I assuer
the that his paines, his
punishment and death is able
to saue both the and all the
whole worlde from eternall
dampnation.
            I will no more be angrye
with the, for the sinnes that
thou haste done, If my sonne
Christ will take vpon him to
answere for the, as no dout he

if thou wilt come to him, & put
thy hole truste in him. Feede
thy hungrye stomake wt thys
meate, that I haue prepared
for the, and thou shalt haue remission
of all thy synnes.
            Feare not any of those daungers
that sinne, that fleshe, the
world, or the deuel hath brought
the into, for my sōne hath
for thy sake ouercome all hys
and thine enemies, whom otherwise
thou waste not able
to ouercome with all the wittes
thou haddest.
            Fyrst and formoste he hath
ouercome synne for thy sake,
in that he hath payd his deth
to me, not for his own sinnes,
but for thy sinnes, and for the
synnes of all the world, so that
allthough thou hast commit-may

so be that he will tempte
the, as in dede he doth daylye
tempt all such as I haue chosen
to possesse my kingedome,
but of this thing thou maiest
be well assuerid, that he can
not hurte the, because my son
hath made him, both hys and
thy bonde seruaunt with hys
death.
            The deuell in tempting the
shall be my seruaunt, for I wil
vse him as an instrumente to
trye thy faieth, and to exercise
thy belefe from tyme to
tyme. So that for this purpose
I suffer him to tempt the
from tyme to tyme, that by
that meanes thou shouldeste
waxe stronger in thy fayeth
and stronger.
            Now seest thou that where

as before tyme thou waste afrayed
of the deuell fearinge
that he had rule and power
ouer the: Nowe my sonne
Christe and I do vse hym for
our slaue and bond seruaunt,
to exercyse the fayeth of the
good by daylye temptacions,
& to punishe the wicked with
continual affliccion and miserye.
            My sonne also hath for thy
sake ouercome death, and yet
not after suche a sort as though
it were vtterly takē away,
but he hath so taken it awaye,
that it can not hurt the.
            For whereas before suche
as hath deyed without belefe
in my sonne, went out of thys
lyfe into eternall death: Now
shall death be a dore for the

and them to euerlastinge lyfe,
in so much that thou shalt confesse
in thyne hart, that which
is written in the fyrste to the
Philippians, saiyng:Phil. i
            
            Mihi uita Christus est, & mori lucrum.
            Christ is my lyfe, and it is
aduantage for me to dye.
            Death shall no more be vnto
the, neyther vnto anye of my
chosen bitter, but sweet: not so
rowfull but ioyfull: not losse
but gayne, not to be feared,
but to be desiered, death shall
not be worthye to haue the
name of death, but rather of
the waye and entry vnto eternall
lyfe. Death shall haue no
power to hurte the for hys
stinge is cut of accordinge to
my promes.
            
               
O mors,Oze. xill. Ero mors tua.
            O death,i. Cor. xv I wyll by thy
death.
            Thus hath my sonne for
thy sake ouercome synne, he
hath ouercome death, he hath
ouercome the deuell, and all
thyne enemyes and myne:
and when he made an ende,
he said, Consummatum est, nowe all
finyshed:Ioh. xix. He hath done all
those thinges that I requyred
at thy handes to haue done.
Despaire not therefore
comforte thy selfe wyth thys
death of my sonne. Trust that
this death and bloudsheding
is a sufficient ransom and recompence
for thy sinnes. Comfort
thy hungry stomake with
this restoretish dishe, (whiche

may so be well called, for that
it hath restored the, & all suche
as beleue in hym, agayne into
my fauor.)
            Whosoeuer comforteth his
hungry soule with this dishe,
shall haue remission of all hys
synnes. Whosoeuer feedeth
with a sure fayth and eat
thereof hartyly, not doutinge
but that Christ is sufficient to
saue his soule, that Christe is
sufficiente to slaake hys hunger,
and to quenche his thurst,
he shall not nede of any other
dyshes diuised by men to feed
vpon: but he shall be suer, that
the death and bloudshedinge
of myne only begotten sonne,
is sufficient to comfort his penitent
hungry soule so, that it
shall not be famishid, it shal not

sterue, nor peryshe, but haue
lyfe euerlasting.
            This is the ioyfull tydynges
the comfortable doctrine,
the sede of goddes most holye
worde, (most noble audience)
which hath bene so longe troden
and cast away vnder neth
the fote of the people.
            This is the lost seed which
when it was sowen, woulde
not, this manye yeares, enter
into the hartes, and vnderstandinges
of men.
            But here I moste humbly
desier you,Nota. to note, that it is
not meant by these wordes,
(eatinge of Christes flesh, and
drynkynge of hys bloude, and
feding vpon Christe,) that ye
should so feed of Christe, as ye
woulde feed of a pece of motton,

a pece of beefe, or a pece of
venson: For that kynd of cating,
profetteth nothing at al.
            Caro non prodest quicquam.Ioh. vi
            
            The fleshe profeteth nothynge
at all.
            Thys grosse kynde of feedinge
vpon Christe, profeteth
nothing at all: But it is ment,
that euen as ye comfort your
earthly and corruptible body,
with bread, and meat when it
is hungry, and with ale, bere,
or wyne when it is thurstye:
            Euen so doeth the soule of
man, (when the lawe sheweth
to her, her faultes and eternal
damnation, and the dredfull
iudgementes of God for
her offenses,) comforte her
selfe in her greate hunger
and thurste: beleuynge that

almightye God, hath forgeuen
her synnes, for Christes
sake. So that where as before
she was hungry, and comfortles,
and afraied of eternall
dampnation: Now is she fed,
and comforted, with thassuerance,
that her synnes be forgeuen
her of god, for Christes
sake her sauiour.
            It is an vnreuerente, and
an vngodly opinion, and voyd
of all Godlye religion, to saye
or thynke, that we muste eate
and chame with our corporall
teeth, or that we muste swallow
with our corporal throte,
Christes blessed fleshe and bones,
after so grosse a sorte, as
we eat other kyndes of meat.
            Yea, and it is a thynge
abhorred of nature, that

mannes should feede of mans
fleshe, hyde thesame fleshe of
man in pastes or culles or by
any meanes otherwyse neuer
so conningly. Man detesteth
and abhorreth to be 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               ,
that is to say a man eater.
            The Centuryon of a relygyouse
mynde, and of a godly
feare, thoughte hym selfe vnworthye,
that oure sauioure
Christ shoulde enter into hys
house,mat. viij saiynge:
            Non sum idoneus, ut tectum meum subeas.
            And S. Peter in theLuk. v .v. of
Luke, had a certeyne relygyouse,
& a godly feare to come
nighe to Christ, and sayed vnto
him.
            
               Discede a me Domine, quia homo peccator
sum;
            
            
               
Departe from me O lorde,
for I am a synnar.
            Euen so all suche as haue any
Iote of Godly religyon in
ther hartes, shoulde be ashamed
once to desyer, to bruse
with there teeth, to eate raw,
and to swallowe the fleshe,
bloud, and bones of oure sauyoure
Christe, euen as it was
borne of the blessed vyrgyne
Mary. S. Austen wytnesseth
that the Capernaites toke
our Sauiour Christe after
that sort, when he sayd,
            Nisi quis manducauerit meam carnem, &
biberit meum sanguinem,Ioh. vi non habebit uitam
eternam.
            Onles a man eate my flesh,
and drinke my bloude, he shall
not haue euerlastyng lyfe.
            They toke him (saieth he)

grosly, as it appeareth by ther
question that they demaunded
immediatly, saiynge:
            How can this fellow geue
vs his fleshe to eat? Is not he
the sonne of Ioseph? Thys
grosse opinion of thers, Saint
Austen calleth heresye, as it is
a playne heresye in dede to
say, that we must eat of necessitie.
Christ after such a grosse
sort.
            They thought that Christ
had offered hys bodye to be
eaten, as fleshe that hangeth
in the bucherye, so that the
fleshe of his armes, and sydes
that stode there before them,
shoulde be chewed and swallowed
of them.
            But (sayth Saint Austen,
that was not hys meaninge:

For that kynde of eatinge of
Christes fleshe, profeteth nothyng
at all.)
            Caro non prodest quicquam:
            But that they whych were
made sorowfull and hungrye
by the terror of the law, shuld
be fed, and comfortedwith the
death of his fleshe, and wyth
his blessed bloudshedynge.
            And he that feedeth not
hys soule after this sort wyth
Christes fleshe, and bloude, is
not alyue in Christe, but he is
in desperation,
            Manet in morte.
            He dwelleth in death.Ioh. iii. v. xi. yea
beynge alyue in thys worlde,
he hath a taste of hell, because
hys conscyence is comfortles,
and the worme byteth
him cōtinually, so that he hath

deuell in his conscience. And
he is alltogether comfortles,
because there is none other
meet & comfort, that can comfort
oure soules, but onely the
cōfort that we haue by Christ.
And whosoeuer eateth thys
fleshe, and drinketh this bloud
wyth ye mouth of belefe, that
thys very fleshe of Christ was
put to death for him, and this
very bloud was once shed for
him: He shall haue euerlasting
life, and the lord will raise him
againe at the latter day. And
he had a tast of the kingdome
of God,Ioh. vi euen beyng alyue. He
hath peace and quyetnes in
his conscyence. Whyche is
Gaudium & pax in spiritum sanctum.
            
            And thys kind of eatinge,Ro. xiij.
is called of learned men, an

of Christe, Spiritualiter (that is to
say) a comfortinge with oure
soules wyth Christ spiritually.
And as oft as we comforte
oure soules of thys sorte, we
haue a sure knowledge, and a
felinge that the wrath of god
the father against vs is pacyfyed,
and so be we of oure for
more hunger eased.
            There is another kinde of
eatinge of Christes body, and
drinkinge of his bloud, & that
is called eatinge and drinking
Sacramentaliter. Sacramentally.
And we eate Christ
on this fashion, as oft as we
Ioyne the outward signes of
breade and wyne, (that is to
say) the sacrament of the holy
communion, wyth oure fayth
and inward belefe, receauing

a visible testimony of our inwarde
belefe in the face of the
congregacion.
            And if it chaunce any man, to
receaue this outward pledge
and testimony of the lordes
death, & haue not this inward
belefe: the same man, in taking
of that visible Sacrament in
the face of the congregaciō, maketh
a lye to the holy gost, because
he sheweth him self outwardly
as though he comforforted
his soule inwardelye
with Christ, and yet in deed he
doth not and therfor when he
taketh this heuenly Sacrament,
his conscience cōdempneth
hum, and telleth him that
he is not inwardly so affected,
and disposed as his outward

receauinge of the Sacrament
doth pretend. Wherfore saint
Paule geueth sentence of euery
suche man, and sayth.i. Cor. xi.
            
            Iudicium sibi manducat et bibit.
            He eateth and drynketh his
owne condempnacion and iudgemente
whiche is an vnworthy
kynde of eatinge.
            Quia non diiudicat corpus domini.
            Because he hath no consideracion
why he eatith of that bred
and drynketh of that cuppe,
wherof he eatith & drynketh
for an outwarde Sacrament
and testimony before the hole
congregacion, that he is inwardly
fed and confortith by
Christus death, but inwardly
indeed he feleth no suche confort.
            
               
Wherefore thus I may conclude,
he that beleueth, eateth:
And he that beleueth not, eateth
not, although he eate the
Sacrament euery day in the
weeke.
            And S. Austen beyng of the
same minde, saith:
            Quid paras dentem & uentrem, crede &
manducasti.
            Why doest thou prepare
thy teeth, and thy bely, beleue
and thou hast eaten.
            Therfore should man proue
hymself (as S. Paule saieth)
and examen diligentlye hys
owne conscience, within hys
breste, and way with him selfe
wel, before he come to this holy
communion, whether he be
indued with the spirit of god,
and lyuely fayth in Christe or

not. And if he perceaue hym
selfe to be a fleshly & a sensuall
man, without faith, and without
the spirit of almighty god
he ought not to receaue thys
holy sacrament: but to withdraw
him self vntil such time,
as almighty God shall more
plentyfullye indue him wyth
his most heauenly grace. But
if he perceaue by his faith that
he is knyt holly to Christ, and
that he is a liuelye member of
him, let him then goe forward
and eat of this bread & drynke
of this cuppe to his most heauenly
comfort. And lette hym
say to him selfe on thys wyse,
when he goeth to receaue the
communion. I goe now to
make a solempne professyon
before God and his congregation

of my fayeth, and to receaue
that comfortable Sacrament
and misticall pledge
that Christ hath appointed.
            And besydes the quyeting
of myne owne conscience, to
declare to other of the flocke
of Christ, that I beleue assueredlye,
that oure Sauyoure
Christe shedde hys precyouse
bloude, and dyed for the remissyon
of my synnes, And
that he, and none but he, hath
geuen me a wysdome, whereby
I am returned againe into
the fauor of God. The lawe
told me, that I was not able
of my selfe (searchinge all the
wittes that I had) to returne
againe to God, but Christ.
            Factus est mihi sapientia a Deo.
            Hath geuen me a wisedome

and a knowledge howe to come
with hys helpe agayne to
God. I was altogether wicked
and vnholly and he hath
made me holy in that he hath
made me partaker of his holynes.
I was alltogether vnrightuouse,
and he hath made
me rightuouse, in that it pleaseth
him to make me partaker
of his rightuousnes. By meanes
wherof my former offenses
shall not be imputed vnto
me. I thought that I coulde
by no means haue pacified the
wrath of God the father, and
haue made amendes for mine
offences, but nowe I am sure,
that Christe is become my redemer,
and hath made a quietnes
& an attonement betwene
almighty god & me. So that

I fele and perceaue this, to be
trew that Christ is god & mā.
            Factus est mihi sapiencia a Deo. Iusticia
                  
                     
                  
                  que
               
sanctificatio & redemtio.
            Christ is become my wisdom
frō God my righteousnes my
holynes and my redemption:
In witnes wherof I wil eate
of this bred and drinke of this
cup, that our sauiour Christ
hath appointed me to eate &
drynk of to my most heuenly
comfort and consolacion.
            After this examinacion, our
conscience wil tel vs whether
we bee apte or not to receaue
this holycōmunion, according
to Christes right institucion.
            Whiche is appoynted for vs
to perpetuall memory of his
death, vntyl his comminge agayne
in glory.
            
               
For this ende was the holy
sacrament first instituted, and
not to be holden vp in the handes
of the priest ouer his hed:
not to be hāged vp in ye church
to be worshipped with a goodly
honor of ye people, not that
the minister thereof, shoulde
by the ministraciō therof, purchase
remission of synnes for ye
quicke and the dead, not that
he should get reyne therby or
fayer wheter, not yt he should
clense the ayer thereby from
euell infections, no more yt the
receyuer therof should be the
better for the receuing therof,
(that is to say for the doiynge
of that worke) but rather the
worse, if he were not a goodly
beleuinge man before.
            The right vse of this holy sa

Sacramente is as often as it
is taken for a heuenly meanes
to putt vs in rememberanrce
of the death and bludshedinge
of our Sauiour Christ.
            Whiche right vse being once
trewely and plainely perceaued
of the people, all vayne
vses wyll fall awaye of them
selfes, euen as falsed fayleth
when truth commeth, and as
darcknes geueth place when
light cometh.
            And at the last the mainteyners
of these fond diuises will
be ashamed of their ignorance
when all the worlde shall see
the truth to ther open confusion,
and perceaue sensibily
how blynd bussardes they be,
& what shift they make, both
to lyue themselfes, and also to

bringe vp and confyrme other
in blyndnes.
            Yt is a sport to here these
ignorant blyndlynges what
shiftes they make, when they
be dryuen to their answer, either
concernynge the Sacrament
it selfe, or elles concernynge
the presence of Christes
body in the Sacrament.
Some saye that Christ is in
this Sacrament realiter et
substancialiter but not naturaliter:
(that is to saye) really
& substancially: but not naturally:
And of this opinion be
the mooste parte of the schole
Doctors.
            Some other holde that,
that opynion is false, and wyl
in any wyse haue thys worde

naturally, saiynge that Christ
his bodye is there naturally
whiche terme I meruayle
much wher they fynd. seynge
that it is not vsed eyther of
Saint Austen saint Ambrose
saint Hierom or of any other
of the old aunceant doctors &
writers, either in greek or latin,
old or new.
            And yet is there one who
hath of late writtē a boke called
the detection of the deuels
Sophistry, whiche vsed this
terme naturally twyse or thrise
in his boke, belyke he lerned
this terme in that schole wheras
he learned the deuels Sophistry
(that is to saye) in the
schole of lyes, of whom the deuel
is the chefe scholemaster.
Some saye that he is there.
            
               
Iisdem dimencionibus quibus pendebat
in cruce.
            Euen of thesame lenght breadeth
and thyknes as he dyd
hange vpon the crosse.
            Some say that the bread is
transubstanciated, (that is to
say) that the substance of the
bread is gone and the qualities
onely of the breade doeth
remayne which opinion is an
heresy in logike, to saye that
accidens may be sine subiecto.
            Some saye the bread is the
body, and some saye, the body
is vnder the bread. And
if a man alledge vnto them
the article of our Crede & say,
that that body which was borne
of the blessed virgin Mary,
& lyued here in earth .xxxiii.
yere & suffryd vnder pontius

pylat, and that honge vpon
the crosse, and that was dead
and buryed.
            That theselfe same body arose
agayne the third day frō
death, no fantastical body but
euen thesame fleshe and bone
and the selfe same bodye that
was felt of Thomas, and that
it remayneth here .xli. dayes
with his disciples after his resurrection
from death, and
that the selfe same body is ascendit
into heuen, and sitteth
at the right hand of God the
father (that is to saye) in the
glory of the father, and that he
shall not come agayne vntyll
the latter day, when he shall
come to iudge the quicke and
the dead, and to restore all
thynges whiche were spoken

of by the prophetes accordinglyAct. iij.
as we reed in the third of
the actes: they wyll saye constantly
that all thys gere is
playne false.
            For (say they) a preste may
fetche Christe his manhoode
downe from heuen when he
wyll before the latter day come,
with saiynge.
            Hoc est corpus meum.
            Be he neuer so viciose a gentelman
that saieth the wordes,
he hath Christes body at
his beck and commandement
to bringe hym doune when
him lusteth.
            And for the mayntenance
of thys there erroneus and
Anthechristian opinyon they
wyll not styke to saye, that

Christes body may be in sondry
places at one tyme graunting,
that it may be at Rome,
at Paris, in London, in Canterbery,
and in a thousand other
dyuerse places at once.
            Whereas if ye read the scriptures
through ye shall neuer
fynd, that Christes body was
in two places at one tyme, or
that after hys resurreccion it
appeared in two sundry places
at one tyme.
            This deuilishe opinion
of thers openeth a dore to
Martion and the Manicheis,
who defyed Christes bodye
after suche a sorte, that they
denied it to be of like substance
as other mens bodies be:
            Agaynst whych doctryne
S. Austen geueth this rule.
            
               
Cauendum est,Epla. ad Dardanum. lvij ne it a diuinitatem astruamus
hominis, ut ueritatem corporis auferamus.
            We must take hede (sayeth
S. Austen) that we doe not
so affirme the diuinitie of his
manhode, that wee take awaye
thereby of the trueth of
hys body.
            And Saint Austen doeth
plainelye affyrme that thys
body muste be in one place of
heauen, whereas it pleaseth
hys dyuine maiestye to be.
            And he sayeth in the .30.
treatyse vpon Iohn .xvi.
            Corpus enim in quo resurrexit in uno loco
esse oportet.
            The bodye wherein he
dyd ryse must be in one place.
I am not ignoraunt that the
prynted copy of saynt Austen

hath in that place, Vno loco esse
potest. (that is) maye be in one
place. But I praye you
what is he that douteth of
that thing, that Christes body
maye be in one place.
            Surelye Saynt Austen
woulde neuer haue vsed so
vayne a sentence in so weightye
a matter, and it is playne
in the decrees.
            De consecratione, distinctionei. ca. Prima
quidem heresis.
            And in the maister of the
sentence in the fourth booke
distinctione decima, that S.
Austen is faslye prynted in
that pointe. For in both these
places ye shal haue these plain
wordes.
            Corpus enim in quo resurrexit in uno loco
esse oporter.
            
               
The body of Christ, in which
he arose, must be in one place.
            These two of there owne
schole be sufficiente witnesses
to me, and to all men, that S.
Austen was playnely of thys
opinion, that Christes bodye
muste be at one tyme in one
place, and can not be at one
tyme in sundrye places.
            In uno loco esse oportet.
            It must be in one place.
            The best waye to confute
this sorte of men, is to set the
one of them agaynst another,
him that sayth that Christes
body is ther naturaliter, naturally
against thē that say, it is
the natural body of Christ, but
not naturallyter. And them
whiche sayeth that there is a

transubstanciation in the Sacramēt
agaynst them that say,
that ther is the body and the
bread together.
            And them that say, the mouse
may eat the Sacrament,
agaynst theim that saye, the
mouse cā not eat it. And them
that say it may moule agaynst
them that say it cā not moule.
            And so shal we ease our selfes
of a great deale of paynes, in
sufferinge the one of them to
cōfute the other, who as they
haue many hedes so haue thei
many wittes, and their is euē
as great a confusion amōgest
them, as their was amongest
the tonges in babylon, wherfore
whē they striue to hit the
matter, they lightly alwayes
misse euē as men that threshe

heynes blyndfyld.
            But ye wyll say to me.
            Syr ye haue told vs what
some saye, but what say yow?
Forsoth, Sir I say as I haue
sayeth, that Christes blessed
body is not eaten with oure
teeth so grosly and so carnally
as they take it to be.
            But I beleue that that very
body whiche was borne of the
virgine Mary, and was crucifyed,
ded, and buried, and that
very body whiche arose agayne
the third day, and that was
felt of Thomas after Christes
resurrection, that it had fleshe
and bones otherwise then spirites
hath, & that whych dyd
eat and drynk with the duciples
after his resurrectiō,Io. xxi. And
that whiche was seen of theAct. x.
               
disciples when it ascendid into
heauen, and that whiche sitteth
at the right hand of God
the father accordynge to the
article of our Creed: I beleue
(I say) that that body is in heuē
only, and is not in the earth
accordyngly as Saint AugustenAugust. tract. L. in Io.
sayth in the 50 treatyse
vpon Iohn.
            Conuersatus est secundutu corporis presentiam
quadragintaa diebus cum discipulis suis,
& eis deducentibus uidendo ac sequendo ascendit
in celum: & non est hic, ibi enim sedet
ad dextram patris.
            That is to say. He was here
conuersant wyth the presence
of his body forty dayes with
his disciples, and they goyng
with him, and folowynge him,
he ascendid into heuē in their
sight: and he is not here, for he

sitteth ther on the right hand
of his father.
            By his diuinitie, his godhed,
hys diuyne mayestye, hys power,
and his prouidence, he
is here and euery where.
            But his manhod is a creature
and is in heuen only, and
ther shall he remayne vntyll
the latter day. And yet is it
trew that Christes very body
is present at the mynistracion
of the lords supper. Yea euen
flesh blud and bone as he was
borne of the virgyn Mary.
            Why but what mean I to say
so? Thys geer semeth to be
quiet contrary, to al that euer
I haue sayth befor, his body is
in heuen, and his body is present
at the mynistracion of the
Sacrament of hys Supper,

These sayenges seme to be
directly repugnant the one of
them to the other.
            To put you out of dout in
this poynt, ye shal vnderstād,
that euen as the sonne which
is far of dystand, is absent
from myne eye and yet is present
to my syght euen so is
Christes body absent from
my mouth, and yet present to
my belefe.
            For my belefe ascendith in
to heuen, euen to that body of
Christ, whiche sytteth ther at
the ryght hand of God the father,
whiche is his very trew
and no fantasticall body fleshe
blud and bone as it was borne
of the virgyn Mary.
            And when I receaue the
holy communion,
            
               
Mea conuersatio est in celis.
            My conuersacion is in heuen.
Wher Christes body is
euen so present to my fayth
as the sone is present to my
sight and as the bred and wyne
bepresent to my mouth.
            So that yf I haue no fayth
Christ is not present to me
when I receaue the Sacrament
of the body and blud of
Christ:
            Yf I haue fayth Christes
body beynge in heuen in one
onely place is present to my
fayth: and when I receue the
holy cōmunion I inbrase him
by fayth, euen fleshe blud and
bone as he was borne of the
virgyn Mary. And so doth al
mē through out the hole worlde
hange vpon hym and comfort

them selues with that only
body, beynge in one place of
heauē, though they be dispersed
into neuer so many sundry
places through out the world.
            Thus farre I haue declared
vnto you (most noble audiēce)
The heauenly banket that all
mighty god hath prepared for
the rōfort of the soule of man,
which notwithstandyng that
it is so comfortable a doctrine,
yet this many yeres it coulde
not be receaued of ye people, &
therfore may it wel be likened
to that seed, whiche hath bene
lost in the way, & couldnot enter
to take rote, growe & bring
forth fruite, accordyng to the
expectacion of the seed sower.
            Now because I haue determined
to speake somewhat of

the fourth paynt for the satisfyenge
of my promes, I will
leaue & make an end of my for
more matter. and procede to
the latter pece of my purpose
this day. Which is cōcerning
what burdes they be, & what
men they be, that hath troden
and deuowered this seed. As
touching the burdes our Sauiour
Christ maketh it plaine
sayng, that they figure the deuell,
who inueigleth & inchanteth
so the eares and hartes
of many people with heretical
doctrines and false opinions,
that the good seed of Goddes
most holy word can fynde no
place ther, to take rote grow,
and bring forth fruite. But assone
as it is sowen, it is by &
by forgotten, and (as it were)

drowned and swalowed vp
amongest wicked opinions of
the martians, the manycheis
the arrians, the Pellagyans
the Libertines, the Annabaptistes,
and so fort.
            These and suche lyke hath
been the deuelles instrument,
the deuels throte, wherby he
hath deuoureth the seed of
Gods most holy worde.
            And as touchyng the treadynge
of thesame worde vnderneth
the feete of ye people.
            The chefe & arche capitayn
tread worde is the Antichristian
Biishope of Rome who
(as they report) neuer sayth
masse but he treadith the holy
bible vnder neth his feet in tokē
that he & his ministers haue
an aucthoritye greater thē
               
is thaucthoritye of the scripture:
or rather that he and
his mynisters wilbe alwaye
ready to treade downe the
word of god vnderneth their
feet, and wyth their wycked
doctrines, stop vp the hartes
of the people that they shalbe
made vnapt to receaue it.
            Ther be a greate nomber
(god knoweth) that stampe
and tread downe gods word
vnderneth their feet.
            And very hard they be to be
knowen. Yet shall ye knowe
them by two tokens commonly
whether they be stampers
and treaders of Gods worde
vnder neth their feet or not.
            The one is by their talkes,
and the other is by their lyfe.
            As thouchynge their talkes,

they be of many sortes,
yet all tend to thys one end,
that is to say to the pullynge
down of Christ, and to the settynge
vp of Anthechrist.
            And Amongest sundry other
of ther talkes this is one.
            Christ say they is not sufficiēt
but we must haue some other
bye merites, and bye satisfactions
not meaning ciuile satisfactions
betwene man and
man, but satisfaction to god
the father for ther offences.
            And they contend playnly
that god can not saue man except
man helpe hym.
            And for this they brynge out
a place of Saint Austen.
            Whiche in deed is in his .xv.de uerbis apostoli sermone xv.
sermon de verbis Apostly and
these be hys wordes.
            
               
Qui fecit te sine te, non saluabit te
fine te.
            (That is to say) he that made
the without the, shal not saue
the without the.
            But the lyuynge almyghty
god he knoweth that holy S.
Austen myndyd no thynge
lesse, then by this or any other
sentence in his workes, to rob
be god of hys omnipotentie,
as thoughe he were not able
as well to saue man, without
mās helpe as he was hable to
make man without mās help.
            But for the defence of thys
holy doctor Saynt Austen,
            Ther is one who hath written
a tragedy. De libero arbitrio.
            
            In the Italian tonge, and is
not translated into any other

thonge to my knowledge: he
is an ytalian and semeth to be
singularly well learned.
            He sayth that at Rome in
that worthy library (most vnworthy
to be in so wycked a
place) named, Biblioteca Vaticana.
            
            Their remayneth an old
written copy of Saint Augusten,
wher in thesame sentence,
is word by word, as I haue
rehersed it vnto yow: but in
the ende of the sentence (he
sayth) that ther is an interogatif
poynt, that so it is not a
determinynge sentence, but
a question. Thus.
            Qui fecitte sine te, non saluabit te sine te?
            He that made the without
the, shall he not saue the without
the? Oh lorde what a
change here is now in thys

sentence.
            How smal aduantage now
can our merit prechers, & our
satisfactioners take of thys
doctrine? Trewly none aduantage
at all, for the wordes
sound now to thesittingforth
of gods omnipotēcy, and they
declare that God is euen as
hable to saue man withoute
mans helpe, as he was to make
man withoute mans helpe
Saint Augusten confuteth
this opinyon of thy merites
no man more, and namely in
his workes agaynste the pellagians.Ambro. 1. Cor. x.
And Saint Ambrose
vpon the fyrst Epistle to the
Corynthes vtterly condemneth
that opynyon of other
satisfactions besydes Christ,
saynge.
            
               
               Hoc est constitutum a Deo, ut qui credit
inchristum saluus sit sine opere, sola fide,
gratis accipiens remissionem peccatorum.
            
            This is thapointemēt of god,
that he yt beleueth in Christe,
shalbe saued without work, by
faith only, frely receauing remission
of his sinnes. So that
although our workes declare
our at tonement with almighty
god, yet do they not make
satisfaction & attonement betwene
god and vs. Such as
vse this talke of satisfactions
besydes Christ for ther sinnes
be stāpers & treders of Christ
and his word vnder ther feet
with ther talke. Another talk
ther is, wherby ye shall know
them to be treaders doune of
gods word, which is thesame
in effect as ye other was but in
words diuerse: They say yt we
shal be saued & iustified in the

sight of god by our workes, &
not by faith only. & here they
condemne al prechars, which
teach the doctrine of ye kings
Mai. homelies of saluation, &
of good workes, saing wrongly
of them, yt they condempne
al good workes, which thinge
is very vntrue. For the true
prechers of goddes most holy
word, (whō they take for this
point as heretiques) doo not
condempne good workes, but
they set faith in her place, and
good workes in ther place, teaching
a diuerse office of ye one,
from ye other (ye is to say) that
fayth maketh a man iust in ye
sight of god, & good workes
doth declare a man iust in the
sight of god yt faith maketh a
man a good tree, & workes declare
a man to be a good tree.
And therfore ye prophet dauid

lykeneth the good man to thePsal. 1. a
tree that is planted by the
waters syde,Iere. xvii. which bryngeth
forth hys frute in season conuenient.
            That man sayth, he hath
fayth, and lyueth vngodly, he
sayth, vntreuly for fayth can
not be frutles, no more then
fyer with out heat.
            And therfor is fayth in the
scripture alwayes lykned not
to barren and frutles trees,
but to herynge, and frutfull
trees, as to the fygge tree the
olyue,Ioh. xv. and the vyne, whiche
exede in plentifulnes of frute
aboue other trees.
            In the .xxi.Mat. xxi. of saint Math.
gospell oure sauioure Christ
cursed the figge tree when he
found no fruyt vpon in why?

Not because the fygge tree
had offendid, but to geue vs
example that all suche as be
frutles trees be accursed of
God. Wherfore ye see that all
good men wyldoe good workes
euen as a good tree wyll
brynge forth good fruts, they
wyl cloth the naked, feed ye hū
               gry,
house the harbolles, helpe
to delyuer the prysoner, visit
the seeke. yea and ther hart
is at newgat, and at ludgat,
and so foorth geuynge almes
though they haue neuer a
penny in their purse, so that
when they be of habilitie, they
wyll brynge forth frute and
geue almes and doe all other
good workes accordyngly.
            Thys is the doctrine of the
trew preachers whom these

that tread doun gods woord,
& hinder the goyng forward
of it with ther talke, impeache
as teachers of false, and arroneus
doctrine, to the intend
to make the people vnapt to
receaue the sead that is sowē.
            I beseche god stoppe them of
ther talke when it shalbe hys
pleasure.
            Another talke ther is wherby
ye shall knowe suche as tread
the sead of Gods most holy
word, vnder their feet. I can
say (say they) my pater noster,
mine Aue mary, and my creed,
and the ten commandemētes,
and that is enoghe for me.
            Let them preche and teache,
as muche as they wyll I care
for none of them all. But S.
Paule saith yt ye must fele a certayne

quiknes in your hartes
of your belefe, which quiknes
shal make you confesse Christe
with your mouthe when so euer
tyme and occasion shal serue,
So that it is not enoge to
say these lessons of our fayth
with out the booke, but these
lessons must procede out of a
quike fayth, without whiche,
it is impossyble to please almighty
God.
            Another talke ther is wherby
they tread the seed of gods
most holy worde vnder their
feet, whiche is thys. Beleue
say they as your fore fathers
hathe done before yow.
            And in this mynd they counsel
al men to stand and remayne
styl styfly without searchinge
any further.
            
               
To these I say that if it were
a sufficient excuse for men to
say: We beleue as our fathers
hath belefet, then had the Iewes,
the Turkes, and all infydelles
a sufficient excuse, saynge
that they beleue as ther forefathers
belefet before thē.
And by this reason, if our fore
fathers denyed Christe, we
must also deny Christ: if oure
forefathers acknoweledged
the bishop of Rome, to be the
supreme head of the churche,
we must doe the lyke, and so
forth of the popishe masse, and
all such lyke trumpery, which
is to great an inconuenience
to graunte.
            Therfore for Christes sake
good people from henceforth,
geue no eare to such talkers,

as say they will doe as ther fathers
hath done before them.
Some other say, looke howe
most men doe, and so will I.
For he that doth as most men
doeth shalbe blameles.
            This saynge also beynge
blowen abrode into the eares
of the people. Doth stey them
from the hearinge and receauynge
of Goddes moost holy
worde. For a confutation of
this founde talke, ye shall vnderstand,
that the great multitude
and number of men be
ignoraunt, then if we shoulde
folow most men we should folow
the ignorant sort. Agayn
if the good men should folow
the most part, then should the
good men become noughte,
for the moste parte of all the

world is nought.
            And agayne yf such mē as haue
ther fayth grounded vpon
the multitude had been in the
thapostles tyme, they would
not haue receauyd Christ,
for the multitude of the people
wold not receaue hym.
            But cried Crucifige, crucifige eum.
Crucyfy hym, Crucify hym.
            Moreouer yf suche men as
vse this sentence in their mouthe,
dwelled in Turkey, thynkye
not but that they wold doe
as most men doth? What is
that? For soth worshipe mahometh,
for so dothe the most
men ther.
            Yea and yf the matter went
by the greatnes of the number
and foloweth the multitude:
Then should the Turkes, the

Iewes the hethen and al infideles
be sauid, for they be most
in number.
            But our Sauior Christ saith:
            Multi sunt uocati pauci uero electi.Mat. xx.
            
            Many be called but few be
chosen.
            And in the .xiii. of Saint
Luk. 
                  Pauci sunt qui saluabuntur.
               
            
            They be but few in number
that shalbe saued.Luc. xiii.
            
            Yesee, that this sentence is
an vn meet saynge to be in a
Christian mans mouth.
            Wherfor for Christes sake
let vs both shune it our selues,
and aduertise and counsell all
other to take head, that they
vse it not. Another sayng and
talke they haue whereby
they occupy the eares, and deceaue
the hartes of the people,

and make them vnapte to receaue
ye seed of goddes word,
by meanes whereof the good
seed is loste, troden, and caste
awaye: and that is thys.
            I beleue saye they as the
Churche beleueth, then aske
them, howe the churche beleueth?
& they say as I beleue,
and so they teache all men to
make answere, as it were in a
circule. Truely this answere
might peraduenture be borne
and alowed, if they meant by
this word churche, none but
the chosen flock of Christ.
            Which church in dede can
not erre. But they meane the
church of Rome, by this word
churche, though they pretend
otherwise.
            Notwythstandynge for

the confutacion of there tread
worde talke, I will vse there
generall diuision of the churche
whyche is thys. They
deuide the churche into the
Greke, and into the Latyn
churche.
            Nowe if I can proue, that
bothe these members of the
church haue erred, then haue
I proued, that suche as saye
they will beleue as the church
beleueth (meaninge eyther
the greke, or the latinchurch)
may be deceaued.
            Fyrste then touchynge
the Greke churche, it is manifeste,
that it dyd erre in saiynge,
that the holy ghost proceaded
from the father onely,
and not from the father, and

the sonne,Libro. l. dist. xi. as it apperyth by
the maister of the sentence, &
bysundry places, in Basill, and
Nazianzen, and especially by
the creed which was made in
the Nicen counsell, whereas
these wordes be.
            
               〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
            
            And I beleue in the holye
ghoste, the lord and geuer of
lyfe, whiche procedeth from
the father.
            This opinion is vtterly condempned,
and Nicen Creede
is amended with an addicion,
that the holy ghost procedeth
from the father, & the sonne.
So that it can not be denied,
but that the Greeke churche
was in a manyfeste error in

thys poynt.
            Now as touchyng the latyn
church, whosoeuer sayth
that it can not erre, lett hym
consider well the scriptures,
which geue iustly and truelye
vnto the kinges Maiesty hys
tytle of the supreme hed of the
church: and he shall perceaue,
that he is both an heretyque,
and a traytor.
            And that may be proued by
two reasons, which be of such
strenght, that they can not be
auoyded, And this kinde of
reasoninge the Logicians call
Syllogismus, it was my
chance to vse them ones in a
lyke argumente at Paules
crosse. The fyrste of them is
thys.
            
               
Who soeuer concluded that
the kynges mayestye is not
supreme hed of the churche he
is a traytor: but whosoeuer
saith the latine church can not
erre concludeth that the kynges
mageste is not supreme
hed of the churche. Ergo.
            
            Whosoeuer sayth that the
latyn churcche can not erre he
is a traytor.
            And agayne: Whosoeuer
concludeth the bushop of Rome
to be supreme hed of the
churche he is an heritique,
but whosoeuer sayth that the
latyn church can not erre concludeth
that the bushop of Rome
is supreme hed of the churche,
Ergo. Whosoeuer sait that
the latyn churche can not erre
is an heretique.
            
               
The partes of thys Sylogisme
be so trew, and the consequentes
doth folow, insuche
a dialecticall forme that al the
Sophistry in christendom cannot
reproue them.
            Then good Christian audience,
let not this carnal saiynge,
and Anthechristian talke
diuisyd by romyshe mynisters
any more blynd yow.
            No it is not enoge for yow
to say that ye beleue as the
churche of the electes and chosen
of god doth beleue, oneles
ye know and feele in your hertes
what thynge it is that the
churche beleueth.
            Your fayth must not be
grounded vpon any other
mans fait, but vpon Christ only.
Yet is necessary for euery

man to haue eyes of hys own,
whereby he may discerne the
true churche from the false,
and the good doctryne from
the bad, the spyrytuall preacher
from the carnall, Christian
learninge from Papystry,
and Christe from Antychrist.
            Wherfore serche the scriptures
your selues, that ye be not
deceaued, and trye whether
your fayth be a true fayeth or
not. Use youre owne eyes, in
readyng, vse your own knowledge
in iudginge, lean not vpon
anye other mans fayeth,
and so shall ye not be deceaued.
            Doe ye as the people of
Berrheadyd as it appeareth
in the actes.
            
               
Erant quotidie scrutantes scripturas inAct. xvij
templo num haec ita se haberent.
            They dyd daylye searche
the scriptures in the temple to
trye Paules doctrine, whether
it were true or not.
            Beleue not the doctryne
because I or anye other preacher
doth preache it vnto you:
but beleue it to be true: because
your own fayth doth assuer
you it to be true, as the people
of Samaria sayed to the
woman:
            Iam non propter tuam orationem credimus,Ioh. iiij
ipsi enim audiuimus, & scimus quod
hic uere est saluator mundi.
            Now sayd they, we beleue
that Christ is the sauior of the
worlde, not because thou hast
said so, but because we know it
our selues to be true.
            
               
These and suche lyke talke
cause the people to contempne,
& to tread the seed of goddes
most holy word, vnderneth
ther feet, wherfore they
muste be shunnyd of all them
that mynde to be true folowers
of Christe, and to receaue
the sede of Goddes most holy
word, according to the intent
of our Sauiour Christ.
            And here is a question,
By what meanes chiefelye
hath these talkes bene sowen
abrode, and bruted amongest
the people? Forsothe by the
iudges in there circuites, and
the iustices of peace that be
popishely affected. By byshoppes
and there officers in
there synodes, and other metinges
of ecclesyastycall parsons,

by Schole Masters in
their grammer Scholes, be
stuwardes when they keepe
their courtes, by preestes whē
they sytte to here auriculare
confession and suche lyke as
mynde nothynge els but the
playn subuersion of the kyngdom
of Christ, and all Christyan
doctryne and settynge
vp agayn of the doctryne and
kyngdom of the romishe Antichrist
to Gods greath dishonor.
            The iudge in his circute
in tymes past when the people
hath been assembled, hat perswaded
the people to doe as
ther forefathers hath done
before them, And to doe as
the most men doth, and so they
shall be most in quiet.
            
               
And to be content with such
godly doctrine as was conteined
in the sixe articles, and so
forth.
            The byshop and his officers
perswade the priestes of the
contrey that they shal also folow
aunceant customes and
vsages in the churche, and to
beleue and doe as the church
beleueth, and hath thaught
them: meanynge by the church,
the church of Rome thoughe
they saye not so expresly.
            Now here hath all the iustices
of peace and gentell men
and other whiche were at the
cessions: and all the priestes
and other that were at the sinod,
learned ther lessons how
they shal talke to their neyghbors
when they come home.
            
               
In so muche that the Scholemaster
in the grammer, schole
herynge of it wyll power
this talke into the eares of his
scholars.
            Oh what hurt these popish
Scholemasters doth.
            They will sharsly suffer any
good doctrine to be talked on
in their Scholes.
            Yea yf ther be a chyld that
haue his father honestlye and
godly affected towarde gods
woord, they wyl pyk sum such
matters agaynst hym that he
shall be suer to be thryse breched
against his felowes once.
            They marre all most noble
prynce, poysining the childers
eares with popry in their

            For redresse wherof I would

whish (most noble prince) that
ther might be a Cathechisme
made in the Latten tonge,
which shuld be red by cōmandement
in al grammer Scholes
through out your noble realme,
and so should the broode
of this most noble realme, not
be brought so popishely vp as
tey be. They shal lyue and enioye
thesame land whiche we
now possesse and inhabit, yf
they be brought vp in popry,
they wil alter & marre as muche
in one yere as your grace
shal make and amend in forty
The good educacion of them
in trew religion, shall be a fortresse
to all your graces most
godly procedynges. The euel
deducacion of that brood of
England in popry and supersticion

shall inconclusion be an
ouerthrow to all your graces
most godly procedynges.
            Wherfor for Gods loue and
the welth of this your realme
moost noble prince.
I wishe that they should be remembred.
            The stewardes of the courtes
abrode in the contrey hange
vpon the sleues of the iudges
and iustices of the peace
and other gentelmen in the
countrey.
            So that they dare doe none
other but as they see and here
there elders and chefe capitayns
in the lawe doe before
them.
            And as the stewardes of
courtes lerne ther lesson at
the sessions, so doth the popyshe

prest at the Synod.
When he getteth once a poer
symple man in the contrey vnder
his benedicite.
            O lord what stuf he whistelleth
in to his eare ther lacketh
no treadword talk, I wil warrant
you he hath all in a redines
and more to.
            He wanteh none of these communicacions
wherby the simple
peopell be seduced, when
thys confessioner hath hym
ther vpon his knees he handleth
him, as him lystith, & maketh
him beleue that the laynge
of his hand vpon his hed is
a sufficient recompence for his
sinnes.
            Yea and they bere the poer
man in hand that that laynge
of his hand vpon their hed, is

ther quytaunce.
            Oh pestylent generacion.
            What shall I say by the throtes
of these people? Forsote I
wyl say as the prophet Dauid
sayth, as Saint Paule recyteth.
Ro. 3.Rom. iij
                
                  Sepulchrum apertum est
guttur eorū,
                  Psal. v. 
                  linguis suis ad dolū usi sunt uenenum
aspidum sub labijs eorum. Quorum
os execracione & amaerulentia plenum est
ueloces pedes eorum ad effundendum sanguinem.
Contritio & calamitas in uijs eorū
& uiam pacis non cognouerunt, non est timor
dei ante oculos eorum. 
               The throte
of suche slanderouse talkers,
of such iudges, iustices, byshopes
and ther officers, of suche
Scholemaysters, stuerdes,
confessioners and so forth:
            Ther throt (I say) is an open
sepulcher. They haue vsed
there tonges to disceyt the
poyson of serpentes is vnderneth

ther lyppes.
            Their mouth is full of cursinge
and bitternes ther feet are
swyft to shed blud.
            They are very wretches in
ther doynges, they know not
the way of peace, the feare of
god is not before their eyes.
            These be they that tread
downe the good seed of gods
most holy woorde with their
talke through out this realme
moost noble prince.
            Some also tread this sead
down with ther vnamended
lyfe. For when they be told
and cryed out vpon for ther
adultery they lyue in adultery
styll when they be cryed
out vpon for ther popery they
be popishe styll.
            When they be cryed out vpon

for their extorsion and oppression
of the poore, they contynewe
in ther extorsion and
oppression styll. Whan they be
cryed out vpon for there disobedience,
they norishe rebelliouse
hartes in there brestes
styll.
            When they be cryed out vpon
for their slanderose tonges
they leaue not ther slander &
their blasphemy.
            These be they that tread
the sead of Gods moost holy
word vnderneth their feet
wyth ther vnamended lyfe.
            I beseche almyghtie God
amend all our talkes, and lyues
that the seed of his moost
holy woord be not cast away
vpon vs as the seed whiche is
cast by the wayes syde is lost

deuowred and cast away, troden
and destroyed wyth the
burds of the ayer, and the feet
of the people.
            That almyghty God may
be glorifyed with the Godlynes
of our talke and with the
amendement of our lyues vnto
whom be all honor & glory
world without ende. Amen.
         
         
            A prayer agaynst the pope
and Turkes, whiche be the
mortall enemies of Christ,
hys word, and hys
churche.
            
               HEuenly father, full
well haue we deserued,
to be corrected
of the. But correcte
vs Lorde thy selfe accordinge
to thy mercy, and not after thy

fury.Eccli. ij. It is better for vs to
geue oure selues into the correction
of thy handes,Dan. xiij. than into
the handes of men which be
the enemyes of thy worde,Susan. v as
Dauid prayed also.ij. Regū xxiiij. For great
is thy mercy. We haue synned
against the, & haue transgressed
thy commaundementes.
            But thou God almighty father
knowest, that we haue
not synned agaynst the deuill,
Pope, or Turkes. And yt they
also haue no authoritie nor power
vs to correct. Howe be it
thou canst and mayest vse thē,
as thy fearful scourge, against
vs, which against the haue offended
& deserued all michief.
            Yea deare God, heauenly
father, we haue done no synne
agaynst them, wherefore they

might lawfully punish vs. but
much rather would they, that
we with them most abhominablye
shoulde synne agaynst
the. For they regarde
it not, if wee to the were disobediente,
blasphemed the,
vsed all maner of Idolatry (as
they do) and went about with
false doctrine, false fayth, and
with lyes, and committed against
the aduoutry, vnclenlynes,
murther, thefte, robbery,
Sorcery, and al maner of euil.
But this is our trespasse against
them, that we preache, beleue,
and knowledge the, God
the father to be the onely true
God, and thy wellbeloued sonne,
our Lorde Iesus Christ, &
the holy ghost, to be one onely
God, yea this is the sinne that

we committ against them, but
if we shoulde denye the, then
should the deuill, worlde, pope
and Turke fulwel leaue vs in
rest, according to the saynge of
thy deare Sonne, if ye were
of the world, the worlde wold
loue her sone.Ioh. xv. &c.
            Here shewe thy mercye, O
mercifull father ouer vs, and
earnest iudge ouer our enemies,
for they are more thine enemyes
then ours. Because that
when they persecute & stryke
vs, then do they persecute and
stryke thy for the word, which
we preache, beleue and knowledge,
is not oures, but thyne,
and the worcke of thy holye
ghost in vs.
            The deuill will not suffre,
suche thinges, but in steade of

the he wyl be our god,Gen. iij. in stede
of thy word he wil stablishe lyes
in vs.Ioh. viij. The Turke wyll sett
hys Marchometh in the rowme
of thy deare sonne Iesus
Christ For he speaketh euyl of
him, and sayth: That he is no
ryght God, and that hys Machomet
is hyer and better
then he.
            If it be synne, that we hold,
knowledge and boast and father,
and the Sonne, and the
holy ghost, for the true onely
God. Then arte thou the synner
thy selfe, whiche workest
this in vs, and commaundest
vs to do it. Therfore do they
hate, stryke, and correcte thy
selfe, when they for such matters,
do hate stryke or punyshe
vs.
            
               
Wherefore awake O
Lorde God, and sanctyfye
thy name, whome they blaspheme,
strengthen thy kyngdome,
whyche they distourbe
in vs, and lette thy wyll be
done,Mat. vi whyche they wyll quenche
in vs,Luk. xi. and suffer not thy
selfe so to be troaden vnder
fete for oure synnes sake, of
them, that doo not correcte
ouresynnes in vs, but woulde
quenche in vs thy holy worde,
name, and worcke, to thyntent,
that thou shouldeste be
no God, and haue no people to
preache, bileue, and knowledge
the. Uouchesafe
O Lorde gratyouslye to
heare thys our peticion,Ps. iiij. v xvij & do

according to oure beleue and
truste. By the deare Sonne
our Lord Iesus Christ, which
lyueth and raigneth, with the
and the holye ghoste worlde
wythout ende.
            Amen.
