            TO THE HONOR
AND VSE OF
THE RIGHT HONORABLE
THOMAS EARLE
of Suffolke, Lord of Walden, Knight
of the Honorable Order of the
Garter, one of his Maiesties
most Honorable Priuy
Counsell.
            
               THis Manual,
I first consecrate
to your
Honor. The
greatest greatnesse hath no

greater honour belonging
to it, then to bee an Abrech,
to Persons, Books,
and causes of this nature.
Such Cedars haue their
spreadth and talenesse to
shelter such Fowles of the
Heauen vnder their shadowe:
And Faith is
content in this vallie of
vnbeliefe to receiue defence
and countenance:
where it rather giueth
both. As Christ in that
olde Allegorie of Christopher
               
seemes to be supported
by him, whome in
truth hee supporteth. And
verely such Bookes as
haue life in them giue a
longer life to their Patrons,
then the stateliest
Buildings and largest
Moniments.
            
               Principally I Dedicate,
and Deuote it to your
vse; Charitie beganne at
home. I first meditated,
collected, and scribled
them for mine owne benefit,

carryed them about me
with Antoninus his title

                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , Notes for my
selfe. That which with
all my might in seeking
I haue sought to attaine,
is the truth and effect of
that which many thinges
promise, but Faith is only
able to performe. Fulnesse
of ioy and constancie
of content in the middest
of the chaunges,
wane, eclypses, and fuls
of all externall things,

and that one day aswell as
another throughout the
course of a mans life in
that latitude and extent
whereof this life is capable.
To cry out, I haue
found it, I haue found it,
might sauour of vanity
and arrogancy: Altogether
to deny it were an iniurie
to the truth of Gods
Spirit, Word, and Grace.
Such as haue found out
Sayling by the Compasse,
the Art of Printing, or

should one man discouer a
speedier passage to the Indies,
or meete with a speciall
Cordiall in Physicke,
or any lesse profitable secret,
should he not iustly be
sensured as enuious and iniurious
to let such an one
die with himselfe. What a
sacriledge were it then to
engrosse such a true Elixar
of Spirituall life, as
vpon some proofe, I am
sure these prescripts containe.
The substance therefore

of them, I imparted
first ot my Flocke in Sermons.
Nextly, considering
how much I stood obliged
to your Lordshippe,
and what speciall vse you
might haue of them, I translated,
and copied them
out in the forme wherein
now I humbly commend,
and earnestly recommend
them to your serious perusall
and thorow triall. If
vpon both, good shall bee
thought the better, the

more communicated, others
shall accompt themselues
beholding to your
Honor, as the principall
occasion of publication.
More I would say, but
I feare to spoile the elegancie
of Augustine his
Preface to Romanian,
               Lib. 1. contra Academicos.
by englishing of it: Wherein
is the summe of what I
would say. Whither referring
your Lordship, I rest,
and continue as euer I haue
done since my reference

without intermission, publikely,
and priuatly to pray
to the Lord of Lords that
you may finde all fauour
in the eyes of God and
man, and that all true
happinesse may be multiplyed
vpon you, and yours
in this life, and a better.
            
               Your Lordships
in the Lord

THE LIFE
OF FAITH.
         
            CHAP. I. The Iust shall liue by his Faith.
            
               THE basest life excels
the best meere
being, as much as
Adam, the redde
lumpe of earth
whereof hee was
made. The liuing Dog, the dead

Lyon. Betweene life and life what
a breadth of difference is there?
from the Mushrome to the Angels
how many kindes of life?
Yea, in one and the same kind how
many degrees? The bondslaue
hath a life as well as the King, the
sicke man as the whole; but such,
as in comparison may rather bee
termed a death. One best there is
in euery kind as it approcheth neerest
to that Fountaine of Life and
Being, with whom to be, and to be
most happy is all one. Poore Man
hath, or rather had a certaine pitch
and period of happy life, consisting
in the Image and fauour of
his Creator, from which hauing
once fallen, it would pittie one to
see how lamely and blindly he reaspires
thereunto. The most part
groaping as the Sodomites after
Lots dore, the blinde misguiding
the blinde in the common Labyrinth

of error; each one imagining
he hath found the way, and so tells
his dreame to his neighbour for a
truth. The Couetous when he hath
gotté goods, as if he had gotten the
true Good, applaudes his soule, as
if it were the soule of some Swine,
Soule thou hast many goods, now, &c.
The Voluptuous when he hath satiate
himselfe with the huske of
pleasure, cries out hee hath liued
the onely royall and Iouiall life.
The Ambitious when hee hath
climbed the pitch and slipperie
hill of Honour, builds his nest
in the starres, thinkes himselfe in
the skie and highest sphere of happinesse.
Alas, alas, doe not all these
know they are in the Chambers
of death? Dead whilest they are
aliue, no better then walking ghosts
in the shapes of liuing men: seeking
and placing a spirituall and
heauenly Iewell, in earthly pelfe,

in watery Pleasures, in ayerie Honours,
which being all dead, cannot
affoord that life which they
haue not themselues. Verily, if
one liue an hundreth yeeres, beget
children, plant and build, and see
no other good but such as these,
the vntimely byrth is better then
he. What then? Is this tree of
life not to be recouered, no where
to be found againe, yes doubtlesse,
though there be many by-pathes,
there is a Way; though many errors,
there is a Truth; though many
deathes, there is a Life. And
behold, oh man that standest vpon
the waies, inquiring after life. He
that is the Way, Truth and Life that
came from heauen to vanquish
death, and by his death hath
brought thee to life againe, who
onely hath the words of life, Hee
hath shewed thee the true way to
life. Hath he not twise or thrise

shewed thee in this liuely Oracle
of his,Heb. 2 4. 
               The Iust shall liue by Faith.
Yea,Rom. 1. 17. but if a man like to our selues
might come from the dead that
hath made proofe of this way
and life,Gal 3. 11. and would speake of his
own experience:Heb. 10. 38. would we heare?
Behold Paul, slaine by the Law,
reuiued by the Gospell, what doe
wee thinke of him? Did he not
from the time of his conuersion
to the time of his dissolution,
enioy a constant tenour of ioy;
liue, if euer any, comfortably, happily:
And doth not hee tell vs, euen
while he liued in the flesh, that
he liued by the Faith of our Lord
Iesus Christ.Gal. 2. 20, Surely he must needs
be blessed that liueth by the same
faith with Bloffed Paul. Come
therefore, you which desire to see
good dayes and lay holde on the
waies of life. Beleeue and liue.
            
         
         
            
            CHAP. II. Christ the Fountaine, and Faith the
meane of Life.
            
               WHat then? Commit
we sacriledge against
Christ in deifying of
Faith? Rob we the
Lord to adorne the
seruant with his diuine honours?
God forbid. Let that be giuen to
Christ which is Christs, and that
to Faith which is Faiths. Let the
power of life and death be intirely
reserued euer ascribed to the Lord
of life, the well of life, the light and
life of the World, the breath of
our nosthrils, the life of our liues.
Thy body, oh man! hath it soule
which enliues it, and so hath thy
soule its soule whereby it liues, and

that is Christ the quickning spirit.
Take away the soule from the
body, and earth becomes earth; seuer
Christ and the soule, what is it
but a dead carrion? Elementary
bodies lighten and darken, coole
and warme, die and reuiue as the
Sunne presents or absents it selfe
from them, Christ is to our soules
the Sunne of righteousnesse: Sin
parts vs; Faith reunites vs: And so
wee liue primarily and properly
by Christ as by the soule: by Faith,
secondarily, as by the spirits, the
bond of soule and body: by a personall
and speciall faith appropriating
Christ to the beleeuer, as the
leg or arme liues by proper sinews,
arteries and nerues,Chrysost. in 1 Cor. 1. 10. 
                     〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                  . vniting it to the
liuer, heart and head, such an one
as Paul had in Christ that dyed for
him, whereby hee ingrosseth the
common God to himselfe, as if
his and no bodies else.
            
               
Thus saith hee himselfe that is
the Truth and the Life,Iohn 11. 25. 
               I am the
Life and Resurrection of the World,
hee that beleeueth in mee, though hee
be dead, yet shall he liue and not die.
And this is the testimony of those
three heauenly and earthly witnesses.1 Iohn 5.
God gaue life to the Sonne,
And he that hath the Sonne hath
Life. And he that hath Faith hath
the Son. So that whateuer we lend
to Faith, it redoundes to the honor
of Christ; neither haue we any sinister
intent to praise the wombe or
the paps of Faith, but to cast all
vpon Christ who giues and works
this Faith in vs, vivisies and nourishes
it, yea iustifies the imperfection
thereof by the perfection of
his merit. Nay, let Faith knowe
that if shee should waxe arrogant
towards her Lord, or insolent ouer
her fellow seruants, she should
Lucifer-like fall from her dignity,

and in so doing, of the best of graces,
become the worst of vices.
Verily, what hath the habite of
Faith in it selfe considered better
or equall with loue? Is it not a
poorer and meaner Act to beleeue
then to loue: more like a
beggarly receiuing, then a working
and deseruing hand? Haile
then oh Faith freely graced, graciously
exalted aboue all Christs
Handmaides. Thy Lord hath looked
vpon thy meane estate, because
that hauing nothing of thine
owne, as other Vertues haue,
whence thou mightest take occasion
to reioyce, thou mightest
the better exclude that hatefull
Law of boasting, the more humbly
and frankely reflect all vpon
thy Lord: who willingly emptied
himselfe that he might fill thee
with honour, whiles hee sayes to
the cured of the Palsey Goe thy

way thy Faith hath saued thee. Hence
forth cals hee thee no more seruant
or friend, but stiles thee as
Adam his Spouse, Chauah, the
Mother of all Liuing: Counts
it no iniurie to diuide his praises
with thee, likes it well that thou
which doest nothing but by him,
shouldest bee said to doe all things
which he doth: To purifie the heart,
               Act. 15. 9.
               to ouer come the world,
               1 Ioh. 5. 4. 
               to saue men,
&c.
               1 Pet. 1. 9. And è contra, hee to doe
nothing without thee, which yet
does all of himselfe. Hee could
worke no Miracles in Capernaum
because they had no Faith. So glorious
and wonderfull things are
spoken of thee: (I had almost
said) so omnipotent is thy strength
which hast said to the Sunne and
Moone, Stand yee still; yea if but
as big as the least graine, canst say
to the greatest Mountaines, Remoue.
What can God doe which

Faith cannot doe if requisite to bee
done? Questionlesse, Iustifying
Faith is not beneath miraculous in
the sphere of it owne actiuitie, and
where it hath the warrant of Gods
Word. It's not a lesser power then
these, to say, Thy Sinnes are forgiuen
thee, thy person is accepted of God,
what-euer thou askest thou shalt haue,
&c. Wherefore we need not doubt
vnder Christ without feare of Praemunire,
or offence to his Crowne
and Dignity, to affirme of Faith,
That it is Gods arme and power to
the enliuing and sauing of euery beleeuer,
as it is written, The
Iust shall liue by Faith.
            
         
         
            
            CHAP. III. The third kinde of the Life
of Faith.
            
               BVt least wee seeme
to speake swelling
thinges, whiles we
soare in the Cloud
of generalities, let
vs descend to some solide particulars.
Three thinges there are
whence commeth Death to the
Soule of Man, Sinne with the
guilt thereof giues the first deadly
blow, exposing it to the wrath of
God who is a Consuming fire,
whose anger is the messenger of
Death, whence came the first
Thunderbolt striking thorough
the Soule, that sentence of God

to Adam, Thou shalt dye; And such
as Nathans to Dauid, Thou hast sinned
and art the childe of Death.
            
            The second, is the spott and corruption
of sinne deprauing, yea,
deading all the faculties of man
to spirituall actions, which made
Paul cry out, That which I would
doe, I doe not; And wretched man
that I am, who shall deliuer me from
this body of Death.
            
            
               Thirdly, that swarme of plagues
and army of punishments, in the
re-reward wherof comes first a second
death. All which made Iob
cry out,
               Iob 3. 20. Why is light giuen to him
that is in misery, and life vnto the bitter
in soule? which long for death more
then for treasures; and ioy when they
can finde the graue.
            Were it not for these three, man
might liue, fare, and doe well, but
sin hauing entred into the World,
brought in Death with it, which

reigneth and triumpheth ouer the
sonnes of Adam with this three-forked
Scepter, of Guilt, of Corruption,
of Punishment.
            Here comes in Faith with a three
fould Antidote, brings vs to the
Tree of Life, whose fruit and
whose leaues heale vs of the sting
and deadly poyson of Sinne: working
in vs a three-fold life opposite
to the forenamed deaths.
            The first is the life of righteousnesse,
discharging vs from the sentence
of death, restoring the light
of Gods countenance appeased in
Christ our surty: which made Dauid
cry out,Psal. 32. 
               Blessed is the man whose
sinne is couered.
            
            The second is the life of the Spirit,
or new life, regenerating & reuiuing
euery faculty, & quickning
vs to euery good worke; which
maks Paul glory, that he is able to do
al things through Christ inabling him.
               Phil. 3
            
            
               
The third, is the life of ioy and
comfort, cheering the soule in the
middest of all trials and tribulations;
which made Iob in the valley
of death exult and trust in
his liuing Redeemer, and Paul insult
ouer all kinde of Calamities
as more then Conquerour, Romaines
8.
            
            In these three, being contained
what-euer accomplisheth the life
of the soule: may not Faith well
be said to supply abundantly all
things pertaining to life and godlinesse?
But what doe I treating
of the kindes of life? what
should I blot paper and tyre my
Reader in writing of the kinds of
Faith, the degrees of Faith, or any
other motions of Faith: things
so well known of those that know
any thing of Christ? That nothing
so much vexeth me to see so
much spoken and written of faith,

so little done by it, the Theory
of it so throughly canuased and
cleered in Controuersies and Sermons,
and the practise of it so obscured
and disgraced in the liues
of Christians.
         
         
            CHAP. IIII. The vse of Faith.
            
               OH Faith when I read
of thee, when I meditate
of thee, when
I feele any part of
thy vertue, I finde
thee to be a wonder-worker, I
conceiue nothing but high and
stately things of thee. When I
looke into the World and vpon
the liues euen of such as call themselues
beleeuers especially of the

common sort, I begin to question
my thoughts for dreames, and to
say; Faith, thou art but a name, a
sound, a meere word, no powerfull
thing. Why are many of thy
followers so dead, so mopish, so
melancholly? why are worldly
men as merry, as iocund as they?
Yea, why are many ciuill men as
righteous as they? whence should
this wrong and disparagement
proceed? Is thy Vertue exhaust,
thy strength decayed in this old
age of the World? or is it because
men know thee not? verily
neither of these. No drugge, no
herbe so commonly extolled, so
famously knowne.
            
               Paul of old, Luther of late, with
infinite moe, euery Catechisme
haue blazoned the name, described
the nature, set out the properties
and effects to the full. Only
the miserie is, the World either

knowes not the vse, or forgets
the practise of it. There wants
a practicall Luther which should
deale by Faith, as Socrates by
Phylosophie, who brought it
out of the Skies and Bookes into
Cities and Houses, taught and
vrged the familiar and quotidian
vse of it.
            Doth not all the praise, beautie,
and lustre of Faith, as well;
or more then of other vertues
consist in action and not in motion?
Is not the gaine and benefit
of it in sense and feeling,
not in knowledge or discourse?
Is not the throne and seat of it
rather in the heart then in the
head? Who knowes not there
is a Doctrinall speculation and
discourse of Faith easily by reading
and hearing attained, such
in one as Schollers, that neuer
went out of their Studies and

schooles haue, of remote Countries,
of their commodious situation,
pleasant riuers, high mountains,
costly buildings, rich mines,
iewels, and al other commodities:
which, what a frigid and ieiune
contemplation is it, in comparison
of that delight and benefit
which the Merchant and Trauiler
enioyeth by a reall sight and
fruition of them? What is the
notionall sweetnesse of honey
or sugar to the experimentall
taste of them? And yet this
Aery, windie stuffe is all, the
World at this day cares for and
hunts after. The Schoole-men
and Casuists, what doe they but
languish into vselesse, needlesse,
and endlesse questions, spending
their thoughts about this magnificent
vertue in cold and bloudlesse
subtleties of the subiect, obiect,
kindes, &c.
            
               
Preachers for the most part inuring
themselues to declaime in
praise of some morall vertue, and
to inueigh against some vice of the
times, happily sometimes finde leisure
to weaue a curious spiders
webbe in commendation of Faith,
rarely shewing or pressing the life,
and vse of it.
            In a word, will you see the fashion
of the World. The Schooles
disputes of it, the Pulpit Preacheth
of it, Profession talkes of
it, prophane men sweare by it,
two or three, few or none liue
by it. I met with a story of an
ancient Hebrew, a reuerend Rabby,
who that he might the more
liuely conuince the people in his
times of their neglect of practise
of this excellent Grace, put
himself into the habit of a
Mountebanke or trauelling Aqua-vitae-man,
and made Proclamation

of a soueraigne cordiall
Water of Life he had to sell: being
called in and demaunded the
shew of it; Turned them to the
Bible, the Fountaine of Life, and
to seuerall places of it, as the
thirtie foure Psalme, &c. intimating,
that if they would make
vse and daily drinke of the water
they had, they might (as it
should seeme hee did) liue farre
better, and more comfortably
then vsually they did.
            And indeede, why is there
such a price put into the hands
of fooles that know not the worth
and improuement of it? As secrets
and misteries in good Artisens,
that haue sometimes a
faculty whereby they can earne
tenne or twenty shillings the day,
and might liue as well as landed
men; but then they haue another
boone withall, they loue

idlenesse, pastime and good fellowship,
and so liue like beggars:
or as land and money in the
hands of those (whom we therefore
aptly call misers) to Haue
and to Hold, but neuer make
good vse of it: Who may well
be said to vse the World, as if
they vsed it not, for they put it
foorth to vse, or locke it from
themselues and others; goe basely,
fare hardly, liue in debt to
backe and belly, as if they knew
not it would buy them good
meate and good cloathes, and other
necessaries and conueniences
for their liues. It is possible a
man may haue a toole, a medecine,
or an engine, and not haue
the skill or strength to vse it. It
is possible a man may haue a gift
of God, and not the gift to
vse it throughly, else needed not
Paul call on Timothy to stirre vp

the gift that was in him. Among
all the gifts of God there
is none more vsefull then Faith:
others are profitable for some
few things, this is for this life
and the life to come, for all parts
and purposes of our liues, in
the vse of it manifold and
rich euery manner
of way.
         
         
            
            CHAP. V. The first vse of Faith to newborne
Babes.
            
               AND first, let me beginne
with thee that
art beginning to liue
this life, thou Embryo
that art in hatching,
that hast so much life, as to
know thy selfe dead in sinne, and
to desire to liue in Christ, (for
what should I cast away speech
vpon scelets and skulles, carnall
men I meane meere Strangers to
this life of Faith, I expect not
reading should put life and spirit
into them, onely I pray for such
that they may heare Gods voyce

in the Ministerie, and liue:) but
as for thee whom the Law hath
wounded, and the Gospell is healing,
who art euen at the byrth,
and stickest betweene the knees,
onely wantest power to come into
the light; who liuest but feelest
not thy life, holdest Christ but
with benummed hands; beleeuest,
but canst not yet beleeue thou
hast Faith: What is the matter
thou art still ensnarled in the cords
of death? Why loosest thou not
thy handkerchiefes and commest
out of thy Graue, and walkest
chearefully in the Land of the liuing?
Suffer Faith to doe her
perfect worke in thee, to forme
Christ in thee, suffer not thy selfe
alwaies to bee detained in the
throwes and throbs of feare and
doubt.
            The Common causes of this
slownesse of beleefe and snares of

Death, I obserue in most to be one
of these three.
            
               First, Immoderate aggrauation
of sinne.
               Secondly, Foolish and proud
humilitie.
               Thirdly, Preposterous desire
of Sanctification before
Iustification.
            
            First, Thou wouldest beleeue,
but thou hast beene a sinner.
Whom came Christ to saue but
sinners? And whom doth hee
iustifie but the vngodly? Oh!
but thy sinnes are Scarlet, crying,
scandalous sinnes. Said I not all
things are possible to Faith, onely
if thou canst beleeue. Are not
all faults easily pardonable to an
infinite mercy, which exceedes
Mans, as Heauen doth Earth;
which can redilier forgiue seuenfie,
then Man seuen offences. Well did Mar
                     •••
                  s answere the

Diuell, himselfe obiecting his
former life to him, that euen his
might bee pardoned if hee could
beleeue. Did not Christ take
the flesh of Rahab and Bathsheba,
and did hee refuse to take their
sinnes vpon him? Did not his
blood wash Dauids bloody sinne
as white as snow? Doth not he
delight to forgiue much, that hee
may binde to loue much? Shall
not his fauour abound to the sense
of thy Faith, where sinne hath abounded
to the wounding of thy
heart? But thou art an olde habituate
sinner. As if Christ came
from Heauen to cure onely small
fearres, greene cuttes, and not
deepe inuetorate woundes, diseases
of eight, of twelue, of eight
and thirty yeares olde: to cast
out single Diuels, and not Legions
also? Oh then take heede thou
adde not to thy great and many

sinnes, a greater then all: Cains
sinne, which was greater in infidelitie
then in fratricide. All
thy help is to looke of thy selfe
an obiect of confusion, and to
looke vpon Christ an obiect of
consolation: And then how fiery
and deadly so euer thy sting
bee, by meere looking (a strange
cure I confesse, yet most approued)
that is, by sole beleeuing
thou shalt be cured and
liue.
            Secondly, But forsooth thou
wilt be more mannerly then so
with Peter thou wilt not suffer
Christs precious hands to wash
thy foule feete. Take heede thy
modesty turne not into pertinacy,
lest he swear in his anger thou shalt
haue no part in him, if thou stubbornly
refuse his gratious offer:
he liked well the humility of that
Cananitish that bore the terme of

dogge, but better her confidence,
that would not be said nay of the
crums of his table. And shalt thou
not tenne times, more honour him
and please him, in trusting his mercy
and sealing to his truth, then in
fearing his iustice and dreading
his power? Take heede of pride
in the clothes of humilitie. Bee
not deceiued, It is pride and high
pride, not to come when thou
art called. Faith is obedience,
and obedience is more acceptable
then curtesie & complement. The
sooner thou commest the better
welcome. It is rudenesse and not
good manners not to do as thou art
bidden to doe, yea, so often and
earnestly charged to doe. To doe
the worke of God is to beleeue in
him whom he hath fealed and sent
to be thy Sauiour.Ioh. 6.
            
            Thirdly, Oh! but thou wouldest
faine first repent, amend and

doe some good workes, and then
thou wouldest bee bold to come.
That is, thou thinkest thou shalt
not be welcome vnlesse thou come
with thy cost. Thou wouldest accept
of a pardon if thou mightst
pay for it: but his are free, and he
bids thee come and buy without
siluer, or else he saies, thou and thy
money perish. Thou wouldest
goe the old and naturall way to
worke. What shall I doe to inherit
euerlasting life, but that is
now farre-done and impassable
through our infirmity: Besides,
before thou canst walke or worke,
thou must be aliue. Did Christ
indent with Zacheus for Restitution
and almes? or Paul bid the Iaylour
first repent, become a new
man, and then beleeue? No they
knew that the one would voluntarily,
necessarily, together, & immediately
follow or rather accompany

the other. Wherefore swim out
of these weedes, lay hold on the
Rocke, and to facilitate thy birth
by the Act of beleeuing, set beefore
thy eyes Christs freedome to
all suitors in the time of his flesh,
repelling none that truely desired
the price of his blood: And especially,
Gods esteeme of Faith aboue
all other Graces, Deeds, or
Acts of thine.
            Study, striue, endeauor to beleeue,
as thou doest in a difficult
point to conceiue. Pray for a faculty
and for the act of beleeuing.
Be not euer beleeuing, and neuer
a beleeuer; euer beginning to
liue, and neuer liuing. Liue to
day, to day is Saluation offered,
steppe from death to life, and
write this day thy birth day, and
number from hence the dayes of
thy life, in which of a Childe of
perdition, thou are made the sonne

of GOD through Faith, and so
made foreuer. Doest thou beleeue
this with thy whole heart?
Driue on the Charriot of thy life
with ioy and reioycing till thou
come to the marke.
            But what signe shall I haue of
the truth of my Faith? May it
not bee presumption if without
repentance and sanctitie? How
shall I be sure it is not that vaine
and dead Faith Saint Iames speaketh
of?
            At the first, it shall suffice to
finde and feele a change of the
minde, an vnfained purpose, desire,
and resolution of new vniuersall
obedience, which is contemporary
with Faith, though
the younger and a second brother
in order of Nature: which
where it is, sufficeth to warrant
Faith, and to embolden the confidence
in the first act of conuersion.

               Zacheus, the Iaylor, and all
new Conuerts had not any more,
could haue no experience of amendment
of life, and yet relyed
vpon the word Beleeue,
and thou shalt bee
saued.
            
         
         
            
            CHAP. VI. The vse of Faith to young men
in Christianity.
            
               PVT off now thy
sackcloth and ashes,
put on the
garments of ioy
and gladnesse. Let
not white raiment
be wanting, nor oyle to thy head.
Liue I say, liue to day, liue to
morrow, liue oh Christian for euer.
Not for one or a fewe
dayes, But all the dayes of thy
life.
            This thou mayst doe, if thou
wilt learne to vse thy Faith, not

as men vse Wedding apparell, for
a weeke or two after Marriage,
and then lay it vp for high and
solemne dayes onely. This indeed
is the fashion of beleeuers at
their first conuersion: beeing
iustified, to haue peace and ioy in
beleeuing the remission of their
sinnes, and for a while to bee
glad of their estate; but then to
neglect and determinate the vse of
Faith, as if it had now done all
it should or could doe: except
till they relapse againe into some
foule sinne, then to recouer life
againe, vsing it as Vsquebath
and strong Waters for swones
and heart qualmes onely, not being
acquainted with a dayly and
quotidian improuement of it:
which ought to bee as constant
and continuate as is the vse of Fire
and Water, of Salt, of Bread, or
Wine, or whateuer is more ordinary

and necessary then other:
such as no part of our liues may
well be without. Serues Faith for
entrance and beginnings, and not
for proceedings and encreasings.
Are we not nourished by the same
Elements of which wee consist?
            Is Faith the Midwife and breeder
of ioy and peace, and not the
Nurse and Foster-mother of
them. Cherishing and feeding
thee till thou come to a full and
perfect age in Christ? Is not the
fruit of it sweeter in the eare
then in the blade?
            Hearken therefore to mee,
oh thou of little Faith, and lesse
vse of it. Doest thou desire to
haue a continuall feast, to reioyce
alwaies in the Lord? I
know thou desirest it with all thy
soule.
            Let me prescribe a Dyet, a daily
dyet without omission, strictly

to bee kept, (The Lord giue
thee and mee grace to obserue it)
Looke how duly thou refreshest
thy bodyly spirites by vse of repast,
or recreations; so often
at the least bee sure to cheere
vp thy Soule by the vse of thy
Faith.
            
            Let thy soule haue two or three
walkes a day vp to Mount Tabor,
that is, into some retyred
place of Meditation and Prayer,
such as Isaaks Field, Gornelius
his Leaded, Dauids Closet,
&c.
            But what is there to be done?
I answere, Still make vse of thy
Faith.
            
            But what is that you call vsing
of Faith? I now come to the
point, to the chiefe misterie of
Spirituall life. Shore vp thy soule
in this Mount to conuerse with
Christ. Looke what promises

and priuiledges thou doest habitually
beleeue, now actually think
of them, rowle them vnder thy
tongue, Chew on them till thou
feele some sweetnesse in the palate
of thy soule. View them
ioyusly, seuerally: Sometimes
muse of one, sometimes of another
more deepely, and lest (as
Patients oft doe in Physicions
Billes) thou still complaine of
obscurity: thus doe, thinke with
thy selfe how excellent a thing it
is to haue all thy debts cancelled,
how sweet a thing to haue God
appeased, how glorious a thing
to bee the sonne of God, how
happy and safe a condition for
thee to bee sure thy perseuerance
and saluation, how pleasant
a state to bee 
                  •••••
               
of the fiere of  death 
                  〈7 letters〉
               , how 
                  〈30 letters〉
               
of glory.
            
               
Feastmakers in ancient time had
speciall officers that cheered vp
their guests, they thought it not
enough to set store of meate beefore
them, but one must come
in and say, Fall too and be merry,
Let vs eate and drinke, It is a good
time, &c.
            Thus say thou to thy selfe, as
Paul to the Corinths (
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               )
Let us feast and bee merry. Christ
hath made vs Holy-dayes, our
Paschall Lambe is slaine, Haue
any more cause to bee merry?
With these Soliloquies mingle
some Eiaculations to heauen, for
grace and ayde: And leaue not,
descend not this Mount till thou
findest and feelest thy soule in
some cheerely plight, reuiued and
warmed with these spirituall Flagons
of Wine, in the strength
whereof thou mayest walke all the
day following.
            
               
This is that which the Sp
                  ••
               se
calles, Walking into the Gardens
and eating of the fruits, &c. which
in plaine termes, I call, vsing of
Faith, and liuing by Faith. Which
if thou wilt duely inure thy selfe
vnto, thou wilt not maruell why
I called it, Ascending Mount Tabor:
thou wilt say thy selfe, vpon
good proofe, It is good to be here,
dayly to be here, often to come hither.
This is that exercise of
Faith, which paul inioynes Timothy,
and calles stirring vp, or in kindling.
            Fire in the Embers vnstirred,
glowes not, heats not the house;
Sugar in the cup vnstirred sweetens
not the Wine. And in such it is
all one not to haue Faith, and not
to vse it. It may well bee said of
Money-hoorders, they haue no
quicksiluer, no currant money,
they haue no more that which they

haue, then that which they haue
not. And so of such beleeuers
as doe not thus vse their Faith,
they haue no liuely Faith, They
were almost (for matter of feeling,
and for present benefit and
comfort) be without Faith. A man
is little the better for a sleeping
habit. It is a rare portion, saith
Salomon, and that which GOD
giues onely to such as are good
in his eyes, to make vse of wealth,
to eate, drinke, and bee merry:
it is a much rarer to vse Faith.
What is a man the better for a
Locke if he haue not the Key to
vse it withall? It is not a Trade,
but a Trade well followed. It is
not Land, but Land well tilled that
maintaines men.
            Oh that this did as clearely appeare
to the world in the matter of
Faith, as it doth in all other habits,
graces, giftes, vertues and good

things whatsoeuer, that the principall
beauty and benefit of them
consists in vse, fruition and action,
not the bare profession, yea the
very increase and perfection of
them. Vse limbes and haue limbes,
the more thou doest, the more
thou mayest. The oftner the liberall
man giues Almes and does
good turnes, the more his liberality
growes, and shines. Vse will
breed perfectnesse, and through
disuse things perish, and come to
nothing; as the Plowsheare laid
vp, rusts and consumes; imployed,
glisters, doth good and lasts the
longer. Let any man diligently and
throughly improue, and great will
be his faith and great the
ioy it will bring in.
         
         
            
            CHAP. VII. An inforcement of the former vse,
with a reproofe of the neglect
and disuse of
Faith.
            
               WHerefore I say again,
Liue by Faith, againe
I say, alwaies liue
by it, reioyce alwaies
through Faith
in the Lord. I dare boldly say,
It is thy fault and neglect of this
exercise, if thou suffer either thy
own melancholly humor, or Satan
to interrupt thy mirth and spirituall
alacritie, and to detaine thee
in dumps and pensiuenesse at any

time. What if thou beest of a
sad constitution, of a darke complexion?
Is not Faith able to
rectifie nature? is it not stronger
then any ellebore.Doct. Bright of Melanch. Doth not
an experienced both Diuine
and Phisition worthily preferre
one dramme of it before all the
Drugges in the Apothecaries
shop for this effect? Hath it not
soueraigne vertue in it to excerebrate
all cares, expectorate all
feares and griefes, euacuate the
minde of all ill thoughts and passions,
to exhilerate the whose
man? But what good doth it any
to haue a Cordiall by him, if
he vse it not? to weare a sword
souldier like by the side, and not
to draw it forth vpon an assault?
when a dump ouer-takes thee, if
thou wouldest say to thy soule in
a word or two; Soule, why art
thou disquieted? know and consider

in whom thou beleeuest?
would it not presently returne to
it rest againe? would not the
Master rebuke the Windes and
Stormes and calme thy minde
presently? Hath not euery man
something or other wherewithall
hee vseth to put away dumps
to driue away the ill spirit as Dauid
with his Harp: some with merry
company, some with a cup of sack,
most with a pipe of Tobacco,
without which they scarce ride
or goe, if they misse it a day together,
they are troubled with
rhumes, dulnesse of spirits, they
that liue in Fennes and ill ayres,
dare not stirre out without a
morning draught of some strong
liquor. Poore silly smoaky helps,
in comparison of the least taste,
(but for dishonouring of Faith, I
would say) whiffe, or draught of
Faith.
            
            
               
Oh! that wise Christians
would as often take the one,
as idle Guls doe the other?
would not the drawing in of
sweete ayer from the pretious
promises breede excellent blood
and cheerely spirits; It is a mystery
in bodily health that to
keepe the arteries and the nosthrils,
veines, and other passages
to the head, heart, and liuer,
cleere and free from colds and obstructions,
maintaines a healthfull
and cheerefull temper. The Pipe
of Faith is the same to the soule.
Hee that is Astmaticall, narrow
breathed or straight breasted in
his Faith, cannot bee but lumpish
and melancholly. Wherefore
as thou louest thy mirth aboue
all other, tend this vitall artery
aboue all keepings, keepe thy
Faith and it will keepe thy ioy: It
will keepe it an euen euerflowing

current, without ebbe and
flowe, clouds and eclipses, turning
euer vpon the hinges of heauenly
and solid mirth. And indeed,
how or why should it be otherwise?
Doe not Christians
consider how vnseemely it is for
them, to goe drooping, hanging
the head? Is any so simple to think
because hee is a Christian that hee
should affect a sad carriage, a deiected
look, a demure countenance
like an image? Away with such
Monkish hypocrisie. How doth
it become the Righteous to reioyce?
Do they not consider how
they wrong themselues of the
maine benefit of their Iustification?
what is a Christian but his
mirth? wherein doth the kingdom
of Heauen consist but in Ioy?
Doe they not see how they offend
standers by and beholders? Is not
heauinesse a check that driues away

and mirth as a lure that wins
to the liking of their profession?
Men wonder to see a rich man that
hath the world at will, all things
at hearts desire, to be but in a fit
of heauinesse. What, say they,
should hee ayle? The Irish aske
such, what they meane to die?
but I wonder a thousand times
more to see one that hath Christ
to friend, that beleeues God to be
his shepheard, that knowes all must
worke for the best, to bee at any
time out of tune or out of sorts.
For a N
                     •
                  abal to be all a mort like a
stone, it is no newes to me; but to
see Nehemiahs countenance changed,
there must needs be some extraordinary
cause: should such a
man as he feare, or carke, or grieue?
What if it doe not yet appeare
what thou shalt bee? Is a
yong Ward prouder and gladder
(in his minority) of an vncertaine

reuersion, then a yeoman of
his present estate? And is not Faith
an Hypostasis and euidence to
thee of an infallible inheritance?
Canst thou bee sad, which mayest
say, not to thy belly, but to thy
soule, Thou hast, not many goods,
but fulnesse of all treasures, layd
vp, not in the earth, where moath
and canker and theeues may come,
but in heauenly places, out of the
Deuils reach, and that not for many
yeares, but for euer and euer,
neuer to bee taken from thy soule,
nor thy soule from them. Oh
thou vaine man! shew mee thy
Faith by thy ioy: if thou liuest
dumpishly, and yet say thou liuest
by Faith, I wil as soone beleeue
thee as him, that shall say hee hath
the Phylosophers stone, and liues
like a beggar, If it were euer well
with thy Faith, could it euer bee
amisse with thee: should not the

temper of thy body follow the
temper of thy soule, and the temper
of thy soule, the temper of
thy Faith? The body may incline
thy soule, but the soule commands
the body, and Faith is the
Lord of them both. According to
thy Faith, so be it vnto thee, so will
it be with thee. Vse thy Faith
and haue ioy: encrease
thy Faith, encrease
thy ioy.
         
         
            
            CHAP. VIII. The vse of Faith to a growne
Christian.
            
               NAy Christian, now
I haue gotten thee
hither, I must draw
thee yet a pegge
higher, and tel thee,
it is a small thing
for thee to come to an ordinary
pitch of cheerefulnesse, except
thy ioyes exceedes the mirth of a
worldling, yea of a professed Epicure
in the qualitie and quantitie
of it. If thy mirth bee not a
sweeter and more rauishing mirth
of an higher kinde, of a more pure

defecate nature, of a more constant
tenure, then any Carnall man
what euer, thou disparagest Faith,
thou art very little and yong in
the Kingdome of Heauen, which
consists not in meates and drinkes,
but in ioy vnspeakeable and glorious,
in the ioy of the Holy
Ghost. And must not that needes
bee another manner of ioy then
euer entred into the heart of a
naturall man, then euer a Sardanapalus
tasted of? Yes vndoubtedly.
So must bee construed that
text, 1. Cor. 2. not of the ioyes of
Heauen, which here the spirituall
man himselfe cannot tell what
they shall be, but of the Gospels
ioy, of the Wine and Fatlings already
prepared and now reuealed
to the beleeuer by the Spirit:
which if the carnall man scorne
and scoffe at, thou canst no more
helpe him or prooue to him, then

a seeing man to a blinde man that
hee sees orient rich colours. It is
enough for thee to secretly feele
and enioy it. Only it ought in thy
life so to be expressed; yea, so to
shine in thy forehead, so to be read
in the very face of thee, that their
teeth may be set on edge, and that
they may enquire, what is thy beloued
aboue other beloueds? what
is that makes this man thus merry
in all estates? Thus let them enuy
at thine, let not thy soule descend
to theirs.
            Are not the gleanings of Ephraim
better then the vintage of Abiezer?
Shouldest thou that hast tasted
of the grapes of Canaan, long
after the Onions and Garlick of
Aegypt? Is Pharphar like vnto Iordan?
hast not thou Riuers of water
euer flowing out of thy belly?
and wilt thou stoope to their puddle
waters, to their stolne waters,

blousing, carding, dicing, whoring,
&c. which should not thy
soule altogether lothe and abhor,
after the taste of Faiths Nectar and
Ambrosia. But euen their ordinary
and lawfull delights, the wine
and oyle, musicke, hunting, hawking
&c. to these God allowes thee
to stoope for thy bodies sake, as
the Eagle to the prey, or as Gideous
souldiers to soope thy handfull,
not to swill thy belly full.
If Plato could tell the Musitians,
that Phylosophers could dine and
sup without them, How much
more easie is it for Saint Augustine
to weane himselfe from the
childish rattles and may games of
carnall delights, to bee merry
without the Fiddle. Good leaue
hast thou, yea, right and title to
vse all externall recreations, wherof
before thou wert but an vsurper,
but vse them aright as if thou

vsedst them not, knowing how to
put thy knife to thy throat, and
how to be without them: to bee
as one that liueth not by them but
by Faith.
            
            Were it not odious to see a man
that hath a spouse peerelesse for
beautie, to liue with a deformed
blouse? to see one professing
some liberall Science, to liue by
some base manuall trade? no better
fight is it to see a Christian vpholding
his ioy by course and
earthly pleasures, that hath more
noble and generous, yea, Angelicall
delights; then which, what
hath heauen better but in degree
only, and manner of fruition?
what hath this world comparable?
Alas poore Phylosophers, when I
read your Treatises of Tranquillitie
of mind, of consolation, of
remedies against both Fortunes,
though in some things you come

neere the kingdome of Heauen,
yet how dull are your comforts
to one of ours? the highest of
yours to the lowest of ours? Had
you but through a creuis or Lettice
seene the things which the eie
of Faith seeth with open face, how
would you in comparison of Christianisme
haue loathed your Stoicisme
and Epicurisme? Had you
but with the tip of your tongue,
tasted of Faiths dainties, how
would you haue magnified Faith
aboue all your Cardinall vertues?
you that so composed your liues
by ieiune and empty contemplations
of an autarky in vertue by the
rules of nature; what stately liues
would you haue led and liued, if
the grace and hopes of the Gospel
had appeared to you by the rules
of Faith? As for you Poets of the
lighter and pleasanter veine, when
I read your oades and sonnets,

chaunting out your choice ioyes
and loues, your wishes and vowes,
framing a conceited happinesse to
your selues, as the highest you
could imagine or desire: what low
streines and meane aire do I reckon
them, in comparison, of our Christian
and diuine hymnes? what
pittifull subiects for such sublimated
wits? what difference between
your oaten pipes and our heauenly
harpes? Salomon that loued both
these loues, liued both liues, and
sung songs of both sorts, when
God raised his muse to an higher
tune, and taught it to sing the song
of songs, how despised he his former
windy vanities in comparison
of his new spirituall delicacies.
Wherefore, O Christian, that hast
such transcendent obiects of thy
thoughts aboue al other men, why
shouldest thou not euer keepe thy
soule vpon the wing, euer in a manner

bee in the third heauens,
rowling and tumbling thy soule
in these beds of roses: I meane
these meditations of thy Iustification,
sanctification and saluation
through Christ, without which,
why should one day passe thee?
why any one part of a day?
why should not thy soule haue her
due drinkes, breakfasts, meales vndermeales,
beuers, and aftermeales,
as well as thy body? Thus
to redeeme time, thus to taske and
tye thy soule to such heauenly
round of worke, would it not make
the Mill of time pleasant, the yoke
of businesse easie? would not pretious
time glide swiftly and easily
away like a boate with full winde
and tide needing no oares; or a
free mettald horse needing no
spurres, needing no idle pastime
to driue it before thee? shall it not
be a pleasure to thee to want other

pleasures? Thus mayest thou make
all thy daies Christ-tides, Easters,
Whitsundaies, Birthdaies, and Holydaies:
not enuying Foelix his
felicitie, Festus his festiuitie, nor
Diues his daily purple and delicious
fare: but liuing a life kingly
and Angelicall, in comparison
of the vulgar
sort.
         
         
            
            CHAP. IX. An obiection answered, and passage
made to the life of
Sanctification.
            
               HAppily thou replyest,
all this
were possible and
easie, were it not
for that euen amiddest
this diligent
practise of Faith, euen in the
stricktest watch, in many things
the best faileth, many knowne
frailties will escape, and more escape
vnknowne: And how can
mirth chuse but bee damped with
frequent slips?
            
               
The answere is, such an one as
keepes the watch of his God, and
pretermits no day without the
forementioned duties, shall seldom
or neuer fall into any foule slough,
and dash the ship of his Faith against
any dangerous Rocke, and
if hee doe, long hee cannot lye,
but his Faith will set him on worke
to goe out, weepe bitterly, and
make his peace presently with
his Lord, and Conscience, that
he may enioy his wonted repasts:
And for his ordinary infirmities
it will daily fetch him out a pardon
of course, washing and scouring
his soule euery morning and
eueuing, more duely then any
Pharisie his face or hands: and
set him on worke euery day as
hee runnes into arrerages, to draw
the redde lines of Christs Crosse
ouer the blacke lines of Gods
Debt Booke. And what if as

an All-seeing God hee sees our
violation of his Lawe, and
knowes better then our owne
Consciences euery peccant Act
of ours in thought, word, or deed?
what if GOD looke vpon the
Hand-writing against vs? Doth
hee not see the Billes cancelled
with the Pretious Blood of his
Sonne and our Suretie? Which
for matter of guilt, defilement,
and punishment is all sufficient to
expunge, couer, nullifie, abolish,
and wholly to take away our
sinnes, in such sort that he neither
sees, will see, nor can see
them as sinnes and debts bearing
action against vs, obliging vs to
any penalty; no more then the
Creditor who though hee sees
the Items in his Booke, and
knowes what debts haue beene,
yet sees them crossed, cleared:
And what thought then neede

the Debtor take for such debts?
Why, but is not this to make
Faith a Pandar to sinne? And
to make good the Papists and
Worldlings slander of Solifidians.
that make no more of it, but
drinke and take Tobacco; sinne,
and beleeue; get a pardon of
the olde, and a licence for the
new.
            Oh peeuish and froward Generation
to whom it is not giuen
to knowe the mysterie of
Faith, which is of the nature
of Soueraigne mundifying waters,
which so wash off the corruption
of the ulcer, that they
coole the heate, and stay the
spread of the infection, and by
degrees heale the same: And
of Cordials which so comfort
and ease the heart, as also they
expell the noxious humours and
strengthen nature against them.
            
               
These are ministred onely to
prepared bodies, these pearles
are not for Swine, this Diuinity
wee Preach not in Gath
and Askelon to vncircumcised
prophane ones that will turne
euery good thing to their owne
destruction: But this belongs
to the sealed Fountaine, to the
Spouse of Christ alone: which
when shee hath washed her
feete how loath is shee to foule
them againe? When shee hath
appeased her Beloued, howe
doth shee adiure her-selfe and
others by the Hyndes and Roes,
not to awaken and offend him againe?
            The Text sayeth, Not euery
hypocrite, euery profligate professor
of Faith that liues as hee
listes, shall liue by his Faith,
but the Iust or Righteous? Which
golden sentence is indeede ambiguously

enunciated of purpose
by the Holy Ghost that
it may either way bee taken,
The Iust by his Faith, shall liue:
Or, The Iust shall liue by his Faith,
yet so as it hath but one right
eare to bee holden by, and that
is onely for the hand of the
Righteous man: Implying,
that whosoeuer beleeues, or liues
by his Faith, is also and must
of necessity bee a righteous man,
a Iust man, not onely imputatiuely,
but inherently in part:
such an one as vnfainedly loueth
righteousnesse, studieth
the practise of it, denieth and
hateth all vnrighteousnesse, endeuoureth
euery day to bee
more and more righteous, and
so deserueth the denomination
of righteous.
            So that looke how the rationall

Soule, includeth and
implyeth the animall, so doth
Iustification, Sanctification,
being indiuiduall.
         
         
            
            CHAP. X. How Faith Sanctifies and
Mortifies.
            
               SO I slide into the second
part or kinde
of Christian life,
consisting in holinesse
and righteousnesse,
which I
shall easily demonstrate not onely
to bee an indiuiduall companion,
but a naturall and necessary effect
of Faith.
            For looke how the strength of
the heart breedes, not onely
cheerefulnesse but actiuenesse:
Motion as well as health (whence

it is that life, is put for liuelinesse
and agility) driues away all lassitude,
hebetude, and indisposition,
brings in aptnesse and delight
to stirre: the like doth Faith in
the soule: which may as the former
in the body, for a time
stand with some sleight distempers,
spots of the skinne, atche of
limbes, but not long with deadly
diseases, either vanquishing
them, or vanquished by them.
This noble vse of Faith will excellently
appeare in both the parts
of this newe life, Mortification
and Viuification: And in each of
these, two manner of wayes doth
Faith produce this effect; partly
as a moouing, partly as a procreant
cause. In the first kinde
admirable is the Pitho & Saada
of Faith aboue all the Oratory
in the World: All the common
incentiues taken from profitte,

pleasure and honour, all
the Topicke places of Logicke,
Figures of Rhetoricke, what
poore and weake engines are
they to the irresistable pe
                  •
               arre
of Faith, which sayeth, but Ephata,
and presently our Euerlasting
Gates yeeld and stand open.
            For thus it goes to worke with
vs, Hath Christ giuen himselfe
for thee, forgiuen thee so many
debts, conferred, fauours of all
kindes vpon thee, and what
hast thou to retribute? If thou
giue all thy goods to the poore,
thy body to the fire, thy soule,
to his seruice; yea were euery
hayre of thine head a man or
Angell, were not all short of recompence?
Louest thou, louest
thou this Sauiour of thine, and
darest thou, or wilt thou dare to
venture vpon any thing displeasing

him, is there any thing
too good, too heard or deare for
him? Mary, if thy teares will
washe his feete, wilt thou not
poure them out? Is thine haire
too good to bee the towell? Is
there any Spicknard too costly
for his head? Ioseph, the LORD
requireth the handsell of thy
Tombe, and wilt thou deny
him? Zacheus, louest thou thy
wealth aboue his honour that
hath saued thee? Stephen, louest
thou thy life aboue thy Master?
Can, or did any Beleeuer
giue the nay to these melting
commaundes or commaunding
entreaties of Faith, will it
take the repulse? Doth it not
constraine and extort more then
all rackes and strapadoes, allure
more then all wages and prizes?
Doth not this Magnes as easily
drawe weighty yron as other

Iet doth strawes? So that when
thou wouldest bee sure to speed
and obtaine any thing of thine
vntoward heart, set Faith a
worke to make the motion, and
that will be sure to speede,
not onely by this perswading
facultie, but also by a Diuine
power secretly effecting what it
requires, conueying into the heart,
will, and abilitie vnto the deede.
It stands not without doores as
a Mendicant Flexanimous perswader,
but enters into the closets
of the heart, shootes the
barres, vnlocks the boults, takes
away all reluctation and redaction,
infuseth a plyable willingnesse:
of woluish and dogged,
makes the Will Lambe-like, and
Doue-like: of wilde and haggard,
morigerous and mansuete.
            No otherwise then the medicine

curing the vicious stomacke,
and restoring it to health,
makes it long for wholesome
meate, as before for coales and
ashes.
            All this it doth by fetching supernaturall
efficacie from the
death and life of Christ; yea,
part of that mighty power where by
Christ raised himselfe from
the dead, cured all diseases, and
wrought all his miracles: By the
vertue whereof it metamorphizeth
the heart of man, creates
and infuseth new principles of
action. Make triall of this in
mortifying the flesh to sinne,
and quickning thy spirit to holinesse.
            For example, complainest thou
of some preualent corruption,
some violent passion that oft carries
thee headlong against thy desire
and resolution, as Castrusius
               
to Hierom, who shall helpe mee
subdue Nebuzardan, Goliah, Holofernes,
my raging lustes that
are too mighty for mee? Answere
thy selfe as Dauid himselfe
to the like: Through thee O
Lord shall wee doe valiantly, ouer
Edom shall I cast my shooe,
&c. yea, when thou hast spent
all thou hast vpon other Phisitions,
tried all morall conclusions
of purposing, promising, resoluing,
vowing, fasting, watching,
selfe-reuenging, yet get
thee to Christ, and with a finger
of Faith, touch but a hem
of his garment and thou shalt
feele vertue come from him to
the curing of thy disease. What
if thou hast often encountred thy
enemie, and receiued the foyle,
relapsed after victorie: yet cast
not away the sheeld of Faith,
but with the Israelites against

Beniamites the second and third
time, set a fresh in the name of the
LORD, and they shall flye before
thee.
            Complainest thou with Augustine
of his in-bred, hereditary,
habituall, inueterate vices, holding
thee in the Adamantine
chaines of custome, against which
thou hast often resolued, and resolued,
modo & modo, now I will
leaue them, and now I will forsake
them, why should I not as
well as such and such, as Potitian
and Victorinus, and yet they
keepe thee Prisoner still, full against
thy will and endeauours.
Find out the cause, which hee
had reuealed to him in te stas &
non stas.
            
            Thou standest vpon thine owne
feete, and therefore fallest so
foulely, thou wilt like a childe
goe alone, and of thy selfe, and

therefore gettest so many knocks.
Dye to thy selfe, renounce the
broken reede of thine owne freewill
which hath so often deceiued
thee: and put all thy trust in the
grace of Christ, And it will crucifie
the olde man, and giue him
his Hoc habet, his deathes wound,
pierce his sides, and breake his
knees in peeces.
            Be weake in thy selfe and strong
in the Lord, and through Faith
thou shalt bee more then Conquerour.
Leaue tuggling and strugling
with thy sinne, and fall with
Iacob to wrestle with Christ for
a blessing: and though thy selfe
goe limping away, yet shalt thou
bee a Prince with God, and bee
deliuered from Esaus bondage.
Yea, what if Satan, what if Legions
of Principalities, and powers
haue long held possession in
some strong fort of thy heart, beginne

to pleade prescription, scorning
as the Iebusites to bee eiected
out of their impregnable tower: 
hast thou Faith, and canst thou
beleeue, persist in resisting and
hee shall flye, and thou shalt see
him fall like lightening before
thee. Christ raised from the
dead, not onely the daughter of
Iairus which was yet within bed, 
not layd forth: nor the Sonne
of the Widdow newely carryed
out of the Gate to buriall,
but Lazarus that had foure daies
lyen in the graue; to that ende,
sayeth Augustine, That such as
haue long beene dead in sinne,
yea such as vpon whom Satan
hath rowled the stone of Custome,
and such as stinke in the
nostrilles of the world through
putrified soares of sinnes, should
not yet despaire, but know that
which falles out in frequent experience,

               Faith can cure diseases
past all other cures and hopes.
Through Faith thou shalt roule
away the stone from the Caue of
Makpelah, and take out the fiue
Kings that haue domineered and
tyrannized ouer thee, set thy feete
in the neckes of them and
triumph ouer
them.
         
         
            
            CHAP. XI. How Faith Viuifies.
            
               ANd what is there
yet further, thou
wouldest haue
Faith doe for
thee? Oh sayest
thou! it is not
enough to bee healed of the disease,
vnlesse thou mayest take vp
thy bedde and walke; yea, leape
and skippe as the Lame restored
to his limmes. Oh! that I could
finde that life of Grace which I
see in some that can make it their
meate and drinke to doe the will
of God.
            
               
Though I be not pestered and
mastered with any reigning corruption,
yet I finde my selfe so
dull and vntoward, that I take no
pleasure in my life. Know also
that this quickning power, Faith
only can helpe thee withall. To
pray, to meditate, to haue thy
conuersation in heauen, to keepe a
Sabbath cherely is as easie to thee
as to Iron to swimme, and stones
to ascend vpward, but nothing is
impossible to Faith: it can naturalize
these things vnto thee, metamorphize
thee, make thee a new
creature, of a moule of the earth
a soule of heauen, of a snaile a
dromedarie: such a change as the
Sunne workes in the vapour, when
of an earthy heauy substance, it
makes it light and aery, apt to ascend
into the middle Region.
Such a change Cyprian saith hee
felt in his conuersion: And how

else came Dauid to that high delight
in Gods seruice, that he loued
the Commandements of God
more then thousands of gold and
siluer, the honey and the honey
combe, that hee rose at mid-night
to meditate in them. The selfesame
duties may be done by the
Ciuill man, and by the beleeuer;
for the outside and deede done,
both may goe to Church, heare
a Sermon, reade a Chapter, but
the one goes as the Beare to the
stake, as a slaue to the mill, and
the dullard to schoole, in comparison
of the other who hath a different
internall principle: which
is as a spring and oile to the
wheeles, that makes them goe
smoothly and currantly, makes
the yoake light and easie.Esay 40. 31. They
that trust in the Lord shall renue
their strength, lift vp the wing
as the Eagle, runne and not bee

weary, walke and not faint.
            
               Faith it is that fetcheth sap
from the roote Christ, that makes
euery tree bring forth fruite in it
kinde, euery Christian in his
owne calling. What else made
Dauid so worthy a Souldier?
what taught his fingers to fight,
so that a bowe of steele was broken
in his hand? What made
Paul an able Minister of the
Gospell, gaue him the doore of
vtterance, made his tongue as
the penne of a readie writer?
Hee beleeued, therefore hee spake.
What made Onesimus of a false
eye-seruant, trusty to his Master,
as to the Lord? The like might
bee said of all trades and sciences.
            Looke what a full treasurie of
all sorts of graces Christ hath
stored vp in him, Faith dreineth
and deriueth them out of his fulnesse

to the vse of euery seuerall
Christian, euen Grace for Grace.
            
            
               Faith is the Conduit Cocke
that watereth all the Herbes and
flowres in the Garden. All which
the more I consider, the more I
pitty the preposterous care and
vnhappy trauell of many well affected,
who study the practise of
this and that vertue, neglecting
this cardinall and radicall vertue;
As if men should water all the
branches of a Tree and not the
roote: Faine would they abound
and shine in patience, meeknesse,
zeale, yet establish and roote not
themselues in Faith, that should
maintaine all the rest, are ambitious
to doe good workes, build
Hospitalles, giue Almes, but study
not to doe the worke of the
Father: And what is the worke
of the Father, but to beleeue in
the Sonne whom hee hath sealed

and sent into the world to bee relyed
on for Saluation; which
worke is the gratefullest work that
we can performe, and which will
make gratefull all that we doe besides:
without which all that we
can doe will not please him.
            What cares hee for thy thousands
of Rammes, thy Riuers of
Oyle? Hath he not shewed thee,
Oh man, that he that trusteh in his
Sonne honoureth him most of all
in putting to his Seale that hee is
true? This honour if thou wouldest
doe vnto him, hee would
honour thee with all other graces
and withhold no ornament,
no good thing from thee, if it be
fit for thee. Meeke thou shalt be
as Moses, patients as Iob, zealous as
Dauid, thy soule and life embroadered
with all kinde of shining
Graces, as the high Priests apparell
with Iewels Wherefore

adde this prescript to the former
when thou art on the toppe of
Mount Tabor, solacing thy soule
in thy Lord, and his fauour
through Faith: feasting and banqueting
with him as Ester with
Ahasuerosh. Bethinke thy selfe
what suite thou hast to him, what
troublesome enemy thou wouldest
bee ridde off, suppose it bee
some potent Haman of prid,
make but thy complaint, and it
shall bee executed and crucified
before thine eyes. Consider what
grace thou standest in neede of,
and make thy petition as Achsah
to Caleb, And hee shall giue thee
the springs aboue and the springs
beneath.Iudg. 1. 14&.
            
            This prescript if thou wilt dayly
obserue, some daies more largely
and feruently, as the Spirit
that blowes how and where it
lists shall assist, and as occasion

shall require: but euery day some
what more or lesse; though I will
not promise thee thou shalt attaine
to perfection of degrees
such as the perfected spirits of the
Iust enioy in glory: because here
thou shalt euer beleeue but in
part, and therefore bee holy but
in part: yet this I dare promise,
as thou growest from Faith to faith
so shalt thou grow from strength
to strength in all other graces, till
by degrees thou attaine to the fulnesse
and maturitie of Age in
Christ, which shall make thee a
Saint in earth, alight in this darke
world, and make thee able to liue
in holinesse and righteousnesse all
the dayes of thy life, with much
more comfort to thy selfe, and credit
to the Gospell, then strangers
to this life of Faith, either doe, or
imagine may be done.
         
         
            
            CHAP. XII. How Faith vpholds life in
Affliction.
            
               SAy then, O Christian,
is there any
thing yet behinde
that may impeach
the cōpleat happinesse
of a beleeuers
life, speake now if there be any
thing that hinders it, which
Faith cannot helpe?
            Oh! yes saies the Flesh (which
euer is cowardly and loues ease)
though a man be neuer so iustified
and sanctified, yet may he liue in
pouerty, in crosses, yea in great &

manifolde pressures, and what a
life can there bee in such extremities?
Oh how doth Faith heere
lift vp the Crest, shine and triumph
aboue Nature, Reason and
all Morall Vertues in her incomparable
valour? Being in all these
not as they, onely a patient perforce,
or a meere bearer, but more
then Conquerour; not onely, not
daunted, but reioycing to fall into
manifold trials and tentations;
knowing it selfe to bee the Adamant,
that nothing will breake; the
Palme, that sinckes not vnder the
waightiest of burthens; the Oyle,
that euer ouer-swims the greatest
quantity of water you can powre
vpon it, the sheate Anchor, that
holds when all other Tackling
breakes. Here is the Crowne and
Garland of Faith. Were it not for
Conflicts, what superexcellent vse
were then of Faith? Euery Cockboat

can swim in a Riuer, euery
sculler saile in a Calme, in daily
and ordinary gusts, euery man of
a patient temper or cheerely disposition
can hold vp the head, but
when a blacke tempest comes, a
tenth waue flowes, and one deepe
calls another, nature yeeldes, spirits
faint, heart failes: then to stand
erect, then to liue and raigne,
that onely can Faith doe, which
hath the Word for the Compasse,
and Christ at the helme. The
greatest aduersities that are, are
but the exercise, yea the soile and
luster of Faith. Man gloryes when
he can tame Tygers and Lyons,
thinks himselfe a stately king when
hee can make an Elephant bow
and stoope to him, when he leads
a Beare on the Ring, or can handle
a Serpent without hurt; but
what a small conquest is this to
that of Faith? When it makes

shame, pouertie, sickenesse, persecutions,
banishment, yea death
it selfe, not onely, not dreadfull
and harmefull, but tractable and
seruiceable? Questionlesse, great
and sundry aduantages hath a
Christian by vertue of his Faith,
aboue any Naturian or Politique
by all his reason; onely, heere is
the defect of Christians that they
want skill, or else forget to holde
vp their shield when a Dart comes
suddenly vpon them. Like him
that was robbed by a Theefe
with a staffe onely in his hand,
hauing himselfe a Pistole at his
backe ready charged, but surprised
vpon the sudden, altogether
vnmindefull, or vnable to vse it.
And if a man hath a Target that
is impenetrable, what is hee the
better if his heart or Arte faile
him when hee should defend
himselfe by it? This makes Christians

when they ayle any thing,
with Saul to runne to Endor,
               1 Sam. 28 7. with
Asa to send out to the Physitians,2 Chr. 16. 12.
as if Faith could stand them
in no steed. When therefore a
storme rises, presently runne and
awaken thy sleeping Faith, knocke
at Faithes doore, ho Faith, helpe
at a pinch, now doe thy office,
and Faith will presenly ayde and
releeue thee with one of these speciall
cordials.
            First, whereas sense and reason
did but dimmely and cloudily
suggest to their followers certaine
broken and confused opinions,
little better then dreames of destinie
and prouidence. Faith will
confidently and euidently assure
thee of this ground of comfort,
that the least ticke befalles thee
not, without the ouer-ruling eye
and hand, not onely of a wise
God, but of a tender Father, and

fellow-feeling elder brother, who
knowing thy mould doth more exactly
measure out euery Crosse
vnto thee, then the carefullest Apothecaries
do their Scruples and
Drammes of dangerous Physicke.
            Secondly, out of this Principle,
Faith will, extract these infallible
conclusions, this estate is not the
Axe of Perdition but the Pruning
Knife of Affliction: this Cuppe
is not a potion banefull, but medicinable,
how bitter and wringing
soeuer. Whateuer befals, being in
Christ, it cannot bend to thy confusion,
condemnation or vtter vndoing,
but an issue shall bee giuen
out of it. What terrible noyse
soeuer the storme shall make ouer
thy head, it shall bee but as Hailestones
vpon the Tiled or Leaded
House that rattle more then hurt.
Thou art kept by the power of

his might the euill one shall not
touch thee: thou art in safe harbour
vnder the Rocke Christ,
and mayest know in whom thou
hast trusted, and art sure neuer to
be confounded. If it be sicknesse
or pouerty, it is in thy Fathers
owne hand: if the rodde bee in
some malicious enemies hand, if
hee turne thee ouer to a seruant
to scourge thee, and dresse him
in the Diuels habit to scare thee,
yea though Satan himselfe buffette
thee, yet he stands by, lookes
on, will moderate and number the
stripes: the Diuels could not goe
one inch beyond commission in
the Swine: hee knowes thy
strength is not the strength of
Whales or stones, and therefore
will not permit them to lay on
more, then thou shalt well beare:
his wisdome & grace will be sufficient
for thee. Hee that is in

good termes with a Prince, feares
not the approach of Heraulds or
Purseuants: he that is out of debt
feares not Baylifes or Sergeants,
but imagines they come vpon some
good Messages.
            Afflictions are scarrbugges to
wicked men, as bushes to theeues,
but if thou bee a beleeuer, at
peace with GOD in Christ,
they lay off their terrible Vizard,
and come with an amiable,
countenance. GOD thy
Father hath giuen the whole
Host and Army of afflictions more
inuiolable charge then Danids,
Doe the younge man, my Sonne Absolon,
no harme. Doe my annointed
no harme.
            Thirdly, Faith will further assure
that he hath not onely giuen
them a prohibition or negatiue
commission but an affirmatiue iniuuction
to doe thee all good that

may be: he hath said vnto them,
purge, refine, trye, exercise, breed
the quiet fruit of righteousnesse,
giue him experience of his faith,
make him bring forth more fruit:
so that though there be in thy Phisicke
some maligne or poysonful
ingredients, yet being administred
by him that knowes thy temper
and disease, and entirely affects
thy health, it shall bee so mingled
with allaies and correctors that
the confection shall be good, and
all together shall and must worke
for the best. When thou feelest
thy bowels wring, or (as in a Sea-sicknesse)
are dead sicke for the
present, remember thou shalt bee
the better many daies after. And
though with Iob and Dauid thy
querulous flesh complaine, and
grunt, and groane, yet when it is
ouer a little, thou shalt bee able
to say, Oh this was good for me! I

would not for any thing but I had
borne the yoake in my youth, that
I may liue the more comfortably
in age: Considering that sicke
thou art, and that of many humours,
thy Father should not
loue thee, if he should feede thee
with sweete meate, and mingle no
Aloes with them: much folly is
bound vp in thy back, and if thy
indulgent father should forbeare
the rodde he should hate and not
loue thee.
            Fourthly, Moreouer Faith will
reminde thee of Christs partnership
in thy affliction, and of thy
conformity with him, the first
borne, onely begotten, and entirely
beloued sonne of God, if hee that
was without sinne, yet was not
without stripes, wilt thou looke
to bee a cockered Adoniah? And
what if the Crosse bee heauy,
and thou a weake Childe, yet

Christ a Gyant at one end,
beares part of it, and makes it light
and easie, hee is quicke of
feeling, when Stephen is stoned,
saith, Saul why persecutest thou
mee? Besides what more honourable
Badge and Cognisance
canst thou haue of thy Sonship,
then this resemblance of him,
not as now glorified in the
heauens, which thou must stay
for till thou come there, but as
in the way to glory, when hee
despised the shame, suffered the
Crowne of thornes, the Scepter
of Reed, the spittings, buffetings,
mockes and mowes, and all reproches
of vile sinners, the piercing
of the Speare, and shewed
himselfe to be the Sonne of God,
not by descending from the Crosse
but by enduring the Crosse: And
shall I not (saith he) drinke the Cup
which my Father hath tempered? and

if thou wilt bee his Disciple, the
first lesson in his Schoole is,
Christs Crosse, Deny thy selfe,
take it vp and follow him, And
glory with the Martyrs, now am
I like my Lord and Master.
            Lastly, Faith will set before
thee as before him the infinite recompence
of rewarde, not onely
renowne in this World, which yet
by Faith the patience, not onely of
Iob, but of all Martyrs haue obtained,
but that farre most excellent
Hyperbolicall weight of glory:
Which Paul eying, counted
his afflictions (which to vs would
haue beene intollerable) light and
momentany, not worthy the naming
in comparison: which made
him not onely, not weepe and
howle, but sing in the Dungeon,
and reckon it a speciall fauour and
honour to be counted not onely
a beleeuer, but a sufferer for

Christ. And God forbid, that a
beleeuer should glory in any thing
so much as in the Crosse of Christ,
in his wounds and scarres for his
Lord and Master: As that worthy
Vincentius sayd to the Tyrant,
Threaten these things to your Courtiers
and Carpet Knights; Rackes,
Strapadoes, torments, are but a play
to vs, we Souldiers chuse to bee in
Christs Garrison, rather then in the
Court, in the Field and fore-front of
the battle, then in the Pallaces of
Princes. The more hazard and perill,
the more glory and honour.
And what else desire wee but to
dye dayly, that the life in Christ
may be manifested in vs? Yea, in
the very instant of Death, Faith
helpes the beleeuer to liue, so as he
may be said not to see death, & neuer
to dye, (but that requires a iust
Treatise by it selfe.) Let all the
complaints, greeuances, wants, and

miseries of the world be searched
and gaged; the bottome will bee
found either to be want of Faith,
or of the vse and practise of Faith:
So that we may well say with Augustine,
to any christian sinking vnder
his crosse, or shrinking at his
enemy, Hast thou lost thy Faith?
And conclude with that worthy
Ensigne-bearer of Christ, Many
are the troubles of the Righteous,
               Foxe in 14. but
by Faith wee stand,
               Apoc. 
               by Faith
we fight, by Faith we
ouercome.
            
         
         
            
            CHAP. XIII. An Epistle to the Reader pressing
the vse of Faith.
            
               NOw Reader, for so
I chuse to call thee
in a Postcript, whē
thou hast reade the
Booke, rather then
in a Preface, when
thou maist there leaue as many do.
Giue me now leaue to grapple with
thee, and minister to thee an Iutergatory
or two.
            How many doest thou knowe
within thy conscience, liue this
life of Faith? Many thou seest
liue by their Lands, by their wits,

by their shifts: but how many by
their Faith? For the want of this
vse of Faith, Doe not many poore
christians thinke, and say of it, as
a poore labouring countrey-man
sayd to his neighbour in serious
priuate talke, That he neuer beleeued
there was any such summe
as a thousand pounds of money,
but that onely rich men gaue it
out so, in boasting, or pollicy to
excite others to labour: so saith
the common Protestant, out of
doubt there is no such sweetnesse
in the life of Faith: for
wee see not beleeuers so cheerefull
and contented aboue other
men. If Attists and Trades-men
did no more dayly and duely follow
their worke, then most Christians
doe practise their Faith,
would they not be starke beggars?
But to aske thee a more
profitable question, Leaue iudgeing

of others, and answer mee in
good serious sooth between God
and thy soule, Hast, and doest thou
thy selfe liue by thy Faith? Let
mee a little put thee to it, prooue
and examine thy selfe, and take
for instance this present weeke
or day past wherein thou readest
this little Manuell. How hast
thou and vsually doest thou spend
the day? what thought diddest
thou awake withall? what was
thy morning draught for thy soule
next thy heart? what hath cheered
and made thee merry in priuate
and in company? whether
thy sports and meales, more then
thy heauenly ejaculations? Deale
plainely, not with me and this
booke (which yet shall witnesse
against thee, if thou refuse to
practise it when thou hast read
it) but with thy selfe. Hast
thou, or hast thou not challenged

some time more or lesse,
halfe, or quarter of houre at the
least, for this exercise of thy
Faith; hast thou not troubled
thy selfe about the many things,
that this one onely needefull hath
beene forgotten (that which only
should be called worke and businesse)
hast thou not melted the
day, yea, it may bee the weeke,
or moneth past, and made thy
soule wholly to fast and pine for
want of these refeshings: if so, as I
most iustly feare it in most of my
Readers, how much more in such
as are vsually no readers? why then
let thy heart smite thee for thy folly,
smite thou thy selfe vpon the
thigh, and say, how haue I liued,
or rather not liued, but consumed
precious dayes in time-eating
Vanities? How comes it about
that the greatest part of my
life is the least part wherein I

haue liued.
            Oh then recouer and recollect
thy selfe before thou goe hence,
and be no more. Wilt thou dy before
thou hast liued, as Boyes slubber
out Bookes before they learne
their lesson. Oh learne to liue this
life, It is neuer too late, it is neuer,
I am sure, too soone; it is no shame
to learne it what age or condition
soeuer thou bee of. Bee thou
Prince, Potentate, Nobleman or
Gentleman, though few such Readers
I looke for: remembring well
what Bradford tels the Earle of
Bedford, and Augustine tels Romanian,
whiles hee was in the
mouthes of all men, most honorable,
most munificent, most
fortunate, in the full of his prosperitie,
in the source of pleasures
in the toppe of greatnesse, &c.
who durst lispe a word of a better
life, of true happinesse, or

what boote was it for any man to
make mention of any such matter.
Yet if any such God will
perswade to make tryall of this
life, thou which saist, what is a
Gentleman but his pleasure? shalt
then tell mee, as Salomon of his
youth such gentry is but vanity;
true pleasure there is none but in
this life. What is a Christian but
his Faith? and what is his life but
the vse of his Faith? Beest thou
a Scholler, a Prophet, or Sonne
of the Prophets, what is thy
worke? what is thy scope? or
what should it bee in thy selfe
and others, but this life of Faith?
What is Paul or Apolloes but
such as by whom you haue beleeued?1. Cor. 3.
What euer you teach,
before you haue taught this you
were as good Preache to the
stooles and stones of your Churches?
What are your Auditors

but dead bones, and skulles, till
they, beleeue, and till Christ be
formed in them. Get first an
hold whereon you may fasten
your Engines to drawe them to
vertues and good workes. You
which would doe that in soules
which Elisha did in bodies, raise
them from their graues: Interpretors
one of a thousand get the
tongue of the learned to declare
their righteousnesse vnto them,
the righteousnesse I say of Faith:
shew your selues skilfull workemen,
such as haue been brought
vp not onely in moralls of the
heathen, subtilties of Scholemen,
sentences and conceipts of Postilers,
rosaries, destructories, Anthologies,
but in the wholesome
word of Faith, which are the
Arme and power of God to the
saluation of euery beleeuer. Aboue
all let it be our wisedome to

liue our selues by that which we
teach others to liue by; wee that
haue, or might, or should haue
more Faith then common Christians,
is it not a shame if we liue
not more happily, and cheerefully
then priuate Christians? not by
our Liuings wherein the Laity
hath now gotten the start of vs
for the most part, but by our
Faith, wherein wee haue the aduantage
of them, or else shame
be it to vs.
            Is it not a shame to see an honor
of a thousand pound a yeere liue as
meanely as a poore Farmer, a Master
and professor of an Art, as a
meane practisioner. Yet this I
must say euen to the meanest tradsmen
and poorest people, this life
belongs not to such onely that are
booke learned, but is equally obuious
and open (as the Kings high
way) to all sortes of Trauailers to

Heauen. Honourable liues, Pompous
liues, voluptuous liues, poore
folkes haue small hope to atteyne
vnto: but a true happy life they
may and doe liue as well as the
learnedest Cleakes and greatest
Princes, if they get the gift to
practise that, which, such for the
most part doe but study and talke
of. To conclude, what euer thou
art, or who euer that desirest to
mend thy condition, to better
thine estate, to multiply thy life,
to change thy few and euill daies
of thy pilgrimage, into good and
many: behold here is the Art of
liuing well and liuing long. Life
is not to bee numbred by the
houres, but measured by cheerfulnesse,
as moneyes not by tale
but value. A little peece of gold
conteynes a great many peeces of
siluer. Manhood consists not in
the bulke of the bones, but in the

mettall and spirits. Is not one
weeke of an healthy man, better,
then a yeere of a crasie; one Sunshine
houre, then a gloomy day?
I haue often mused how a man
might come neerest to that life
which Adam lost, and recompence
in this latter age of the
World, (wherein the liues of
men are so contracted) the longaeuity
of those that liued before
the Floud. And this is the best
helpe I finde: To liue well is to
liue twise. A good man doubles
and amplifies his dayes: one may
speake as much in few words as
another in many. Persius wrote
more in a few leaues then Marsus
in large volumes. One day led
by the rules of Faith is better then
an immortalitie of vanity. A
man may liue to as good content
to himselfe and others, in a short
space, as others in a long life;

some are old in yeeres tediously
drawne out, others in howers
cheerfully spent, some haue been
long, and others haue liued long,
and they onely are such as haue
liued this life; of whom I conclude
as doth the story of the Kings,
Ieremiahs Prophecie, touching
Zedekiah vpon his aduancement
by the King of Babell, His portion
was a continuall portion, a
Kingly portion, euery day a certayne
all the dayes of his life, such
I say it is, or might be, if Christians
might be perswaded not to
content themselues to professe or
thinke they haue Faith, but to liue
by their Faith:A needfull Caueat. onely before I
part with thee, take from me one
Caueat, one aduise, one request,
and so an end.
            First, take heede thou mistakest
me not in all this, as if I had spoken
of an absolute perfection in

this life equall to vision & fruition
in the life to come, confounded
Heauen with earth, as if I thought
my selfe, or any other to haue
comprehended. If any man
thinkes hee beleeues any thing,
hee beleeues nothing yet as hee
ought to beleeue, but all things
in part, and imperfectly. Wee
cannot by all our assiduousnesse
in Reading, Prayer, and Meditation
haue Gods Spirit at an absolute
command, no more then
Mariners the winde, or Husbandmen
the showers, so as the most
obseruant beleeuer hath his turbida
interualla, his buffetings, lest
hee bee too much exalted, his
desertions wherein his beloued
will hide himselfe behinde the
grates, not to bee found of him
for a while, that hee seeke him
more eagerly, and prise his presence
more thankefully, more

heedefully keepe him when hee
hath him, and be wholly dependant
on his grace; yet so as this
remaines most sure and certaine,
that the constant and dayly Practiser
of his faith shall constantly,
and congruously bee seconded
with the gusts and gales of his
spirit, the onely true Zephirus and
Fauonius, shall haue Satan tyed
vp from long and frequent molesting
him, shall not haue such
tedious absences of the Spirit,
such vncertaine fits and moodes
of his ioy and comfort, as the
negligent and loose beleeuer, but
a more stedfast frame and tenor
of ioy, then any other kinde of
man in the world that takes not
this course.
            Prouided that thou take this
aduise,A profitable aduice. that for the better and
stronger vse of this Faith, thou
seele vp thy senses and chaine vp

thy reason. Walking by sight,
and walking by Faith are opposite
things: and therefore as men fortifie
the visuall beames of one eye
by closing the other; so must thou
winke and close vp the eye of thy
soule to all worldly things, that
thou mayest by the prospectiue of
Faith fixe thy spirituall eye vpon
heauenly delights: not that thou
needest goe out of this world and
sequester thy selfe like an Eremite
into Dennes and Caues, retired
from all societie, but euen in the
middest of all glistering obiects
see them as if thou sawest them
not; that is without being deepely
affected with them. So looked
Paul from off the things that are
seene euen in the middest of Rome,
and looked vpon things which
were not seene: and Moses in
Pharaohs Court saw him that was
inuisible.
            
               
A right beleeuer goes through
the world, as a man whose minde
is in a deepe study: or as one that
hath speciall haste of some weighty
businesse, goes through a street;
that gazeth on nothing, heares
nothing, mindes nothing that is
in the way, but onely that which
his head is taken vp withall: Our
conuersation is in heauen, our
treasure is in heauen. Oh! that
all our thoughts were there, so as
no earthly obiect might detaine,
or distract them, no more then
must needes bee in our callings, so
that the maine bent and intention
of all that is within vs might be set
vpon the dayly nourishing of our
Faith.
            For which purpose I make this
parting and farewell suite vnto
thee,An earnest request. as thou meanest to receiue
any good by this Booke. That
thou wouldest euen from this

very houre wherein thou endest
the reading of it, determine and
couenant, betwixt God and thy
soule, neuer whilest thou liuest
on the face of this earth to omit
one day (God enabling thee by
his Spirit) wherein thou wilt not
vindicate and redeeme, at the least,
one halfe or quarter of an hower,
either twise or once in the day,
at the least: Wherein all other
affaires layd aside, thou mayest
withdraw thy selfe apart from
all company, and occasions, with
a non obstante, to practise the exercise
formerly prescribed. That
is, by Prayer, Reading, and Meditation,
to put some strength
and life into thy Faith, till thou
hast cheered, and reuiued, and
warmed thy soule therewithall.
This if thou shalt inuiolably obserue,
the strength, the feeling,
the comfort, and the fruites of

thy Faith will by little and little insensibly,
and in a little while, most
sensibly thriue and growe till thou
commest to the ripenesse of age in
Christ.
            What hurt can it bee to thee if
thou shouldest binde thy selfe by
vow hereunto, or if thou fearest
thy strength, yet by full purpose
thus to doe all and euery day of thy
life: that so in the Lees and Dregs
of time, whiles fleshly Protestants
are raysing contention about matters
of Faith, or making Sects and
Schismes in the Church about
needelesse trifles, thou maist edifie
thy selfe in thy most holy Faith
and whilest thou liuest in the darke
wombe of this world, liue by the
Nauell of Faith till thou come to
haue thy mouth satiate with fulnesse
of all good things at the right
hand of God. When, as Elizabeth
Folk said, Faith shal cease to be Faith

and be turned into fruition, and wee
receiue the ende of our Faith, the saluation
of our soules.
            
            These things haue I written that
your ioy may be full.
            The Iust shall liue by his Faith.
            According to thy Faith so be it to
thee.
            Lord increase our Faith.
