            To the tune of, In Melton on a day.
            
               ALas and well away,
               that ere I trod on ground
               To ſee this hapieſſe day,
               wherein ſuch griefes abound.
               Alas I cannot ſleepe,
               my ioyes are cleane exilde:
               I cannot chooſe but weepe,
               becauſe I was beguild.
            
            
               When I oſhuld take the meat,
               that ſhould my life ſuſtaine:
               There is nothing that I eat,
               but aggrauates my paine,
               Oh, fie on him whoſe déede
               doth cauſe me thus complaine
               My heart within doth bleede,
               with ſorrow griefe and paine.
            
            
               Ah, euill might he thriue,
               that ſpoil'd me of my health:
               The cruelſt wretch aliue,
               hath me vndone by ſtealth.
               For where I liu'd a maid,
               a maiden in good fame,
               He hath me now betrayde,
               and brought me vnto ſhame.
            
            
               My maidenhead is loſt,
               oh, curſed be the hower:
               When he that lou'd me moſt:
               ſhould ſeeke me to deflower.
               Now am I great with childe,
               as great as I may goe:
               He that hath me beguild,
               a way is gone me fro.
            
            
               And left me here alone,
               within this deſart place:
               To waile and make my moane,
               O moſt diſtreſſed caſe.
               What ſhall of me betide,
               none but the Lord doth know:
               He that ſhould be my guide,
               hath left me here in woe.
            
            
               Ye windes reſound my cryes,
               within the Miſers eares:
               That he with watry eyes,
               may ſhed his briniſh teares.
               To waile the late done déede.
               that he committed haue:
               Or elſe to come with ſpeede,
               my babe and me to ſaue.
            
            
               The trees can witneſſe well,
               my priuy griefe and paine:
               Theſe Rocks and ſtones can tell
               the ſorrowes I ſubſtaine
               My meate is hawes and hips,
               my drinke is water cleare:
               Nought els my tender lips,
               haue taſted this halfe yeare.
            
            
               O whelpe of Tigers broode,
               couldſt thou finde in thy hart,
               With her that did thée good,
               to play ſo lewde a part.
               Woe worth me poore woman,
               that did thée alwaies helpe,
               And curſed be the Dam,
               brought forth ſo bad a whelp.
            
            
               Thou hadſt me at thy call,
               as hawkes are at the lure:
               My ſelfe, my goods and all,
               and what I might procure.
               Thou hadſt it at thy neede,
               I neuer ſayd thée nay,
               To ſtand thée ought in ſtéede,
               or helpe thée any way.
            
            
               And now thou doeſt requite,
               this loue I beare to thee:
               With deadly deepe diſpite,
               as now I plainely ſee.
               To leaue me comfortleſſe,
               my lukleſſe ſtate to rue:
               Thou canſt not ſay no leſſe,
               but thou haſt beu vatrue.
            
            
               Woe worth the time that I
               gaue credit to thy words:
               For now I platnely trie,
               thou buſhes giu'ſt for birds.
               Woe worth thoſe fained teares,
               which thou haſt often ſpent:
               They brought me in the dryers
               which make me now lament.
            
            
               O would to God I had
               not knowne thy periur'd face:
               I might haue then bene glad,
               where now I reape alaſſe.
               For I did neuer offend,
               before that time with thée:
               Nor neuer did intend,
               to ſpot my chaſtity.
            
            
               But ſith no words will ſerue,
               to counteruaile thine act:
               And that thou doeſt deſerue,
               hell torments for thy fact.
               I will hold me contont,
               till that I breathe my laſt:
               I cannot now briuent,
               the thing is done and paſt.
            
            
               Ye maides be warnd by me,
               let no ſuch cogging mates,
               Spot your virginitie,
               by any ſubtill feates.
               Leaſt in the ende you ſay,
               and ſing as now I doe:
               Alas and well away,
               we are beguiled too.
            
            
               Conſider words are winde,
               or of ſmall force at leaſt:
               And men are moſt vnkinde,
               I ſpeake probatum eſt.
               
               There is no truoch in men,
               the beſt is all to had:
               Who truſts their dealings then
               I hold them worſe than mad.
            
            
               Who truſts to rotten boughes
               ſhall fall ere they bewares:
               Who credites fayned vowes:
               are ſoneſt brought to care.
               My ſelfe may iuſtly ſay.
               I prou'd it to my paine:
               I neuer ſaw the day,
               but words & deeds were twain
            
            
               And thus to end my ſong,
               I wiſh you all beware,
               And of the flattering tongue,
               to haue a ſpeciall care.
               Kéepe well your honeſt name,
               as the apple of your eye,
               So ſhall your laſting fame.
               remaine eternally.
