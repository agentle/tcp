            Of the vnite & Scisme of the olde Chirche.
            
               OWr Lorde / being the autour of peace and vnite & not of stryfe & dissencion / anon from the begininge and from the fyrst calling of his people the Iewes / he most straightly bound them to gither reteyned into the felowship of one bodie bothe with lawes ecclesiastik and politike.Isa. lvij i. Cor. xiiij. For he commāded them to cleaue onely to the one god / him onely to call vpon / him onelye to loue & worship / yea and that with no nother rites nor by nonother wais then himself had prescribed and taught them he prescribed them not aftir their own deuyce / not in euery place thei listed / but in one place / at one altare / and that aftir his own prescript lawes to sacrifice / and not any where els to runforthe to strange gods for helpe / lest thei shuld diuyd their hertis vnto manye with helpinge gods or saintes as thei be nowe called: but as thei were the membres of one body / so to haue respecte onelye to one god / his lawes onely to obserue and fermelye to perseuer & abyde in vnite and concorde of religiō. And althoughe this peple then beinge vnder the

Iuges did oftē tymes erre & transgresse yet abode thei in that vnite / namely vnder Samuel and Kinge Dauid and in the fyrst yeres of king Solomon his raigne. But that firste most vngodly and ambicious herety a Hieroboam dissolued and broke this auncient intire vnite of that chirch / for he did fyrste set vp the Calues to be worshiped in Dā and Bersaba / inuenting a newe religion & a newe worship for god / that is / euen a strā
               ge worship agenst gods lawe wherby himself with his peple were alienated frō God and his trwe worship / he so diuidīg the hertis of the peple that thei coude nether depē
               de onely nor wait vpon the onely one God and his lawes / nor yet agree amonge them selues in any ciuile societe.Hieroboā the fyrst heretyke. The .iij of the kinges ca. xi. & xij. For let our faith ☞and religion be once corrupt diuided & mixt with mens dreamed rites / supersticious ceremonies / troublous tradiciōs with armed Actis and articles / and anon there must nedis folowe ciuyle sedicions bataill and stryfes as ye may see it this daye begun. And here by the waye / thow shalt knowe that an heretyk is he that by false doctryne or by defendinge the same / diuideth any chirch whiche was / or is lykelye to be / wel instituted.who be heretykes. But in these troublous contencions and sedicious

strifes the pore miserable peple were then greuouslye tormoiled and tormēted vntil the Lorde with the swerde of the Assirions did kutof and made an ende (for that tyme) of their abhominable heresies and scismes / as euē now aftir the thrustinge away of the Gospell graciouslye offced vs / there must nedis folow blody bataill and mutacions of kinges and realmes as the stories & wordes of the Byble playnly declare. For when Princes feare that the worde of peace and obedience frely and purely preached wold make mutacion tumulte and sedicions and so for this cause represse the free course therof ether by puttinge the prechers to silence / by banisshing them or burning them / then (be thei sewer) Quod verebantur / hoc accidet illis.Iob. iij. That at thei feared shall come vpon them / the Lord so threatening and adsewering them saing. For as asmich as this people abhorred the swete waters of Silo that flow so still (Silo is the swete gospel of peace sent vs) & hath rather pleasure in this king Rezin & in the sone of Romilus / that is in their wont wiked Romisshe rites and tradiciōs:Isa. viij behold / behold saith the Lord / I shall cause the mighty flowdes to swel vp and to breake in vpon them / euen the kinge of the

Assirions / whose parte (aftir the way be made for him by the ciuyle batails of the christians emonge them selues) the greate Turke shall play it. Oh Immanuel.
            Let this therfore be a warninge in tyme to all realmes christen / wherin because the very Hieroboams euē the counsails of the Bisshops with their captiued seculare armes haue most heretically & scismatykly with their borowed seclar swerd kut in sondre the most holy vnite and concorde of Christes chirche mangled and hacked into so many decent rites & laudable (as thei saye) ceremonies &c̄ / by burning and banisshing the fre trwe prechers / holdinge yet fast in their honowr the Popes thorney tradicions and false religiō diuiding the peples hertis from god into a thousande wais / workes / worshipings / merites / saintes to pray with / or for vs (I can not tell whether) some sent to the Bisshops boke for their saluaciō / some to the Actes of the perlement to seke oute their articles of the Popes faith fathered by these sedicious Hieroboams counsail vpon the Kinge & his Nobles / but none do thei sende to the holye Byble / albeit vnder a colowr it be layd in euery parissh Chirch and the curate which ether with an euill wille or els can skant spel

it / commanded to reade it. Because (I saye) these faccious bocherely Hieroboams haue made lyke diuision in our chirches / therfore a lyke swerde (if thei repent not in tyme) abideth them to diuide thir heads from their bodies and their soules from god. But I returne to where I left of. Thē was there yet left in Iudea two trybs whiche worshiped the Lorde at Hierusalem / which peple for al this godly monicion and blody ensample at Israel their neyghbours captyuite / yet dyd theis twe
                  •
                trybs haunt still their newe gods and a newe wais in worshiping their verye God aftir their owne deuices mixt togither with gods prescripte lawes. Wherfore euē those same two trybs also / it behoued into the vengeance taking of their heresy and diuision (Heresy (I saye) is a scabbe which diuideth christen chirches) to be kut away withe the swerde of the Caldeis.Heresie For so sayd the Lorde oft before by his ꝓphetis. Thus thou seest (good reader) how that stryf and batail☞ folowe the diuision of the vnite of chirches and the corrupcion of religiō: which vngodlines / heresyes / and scismes / the swerde of the Turke at laste must kutte clene awaye / when our vnientle Hieroboams wil not suffer the sweet swerde of gods worde peaceably

preched to diuide vs from owr wiked lyuinge into the vnite of one faithe onely therby to be iustified / and into one and the same christen religion to be baptized.
            From the returne out of the Babilonik captiuite / for a lytle space the Iewes were somwhat more religious / perseuering in the vnite of the trwe doctrine. And thē were there Bysshops vnto whose cure the doctryne of the trwthe and vnite of the chirch was cō

so by their own tradicions and institucions thei derkened and oppressed the holy sacred religion of god / yea by their hipocrysy and supersticion thei vtterly so deformed it / that thei made it abhominable heresye (as thei haue now done) and new lerning to be lothed & detested of all men / In somiche that Iohn Bapt. and Christe himself now comen / the trwe religion / pure gospell / and the playne doctrine of the trwthe were skant knowne / for that thei were so vtterly deformed & corrupted (as thei be now I saye) with mennis vayn tradicions.

For thei shalbe smitēdown with the edge of the swerde / and shall be led captiue into among all the strange nacions.

Let vs nowe therfore in tyme (christen bretherne) fere the lord and walke in his precepts / not promising ourselues any securite or longe life in this our corrupcion and synnes / for God owr iuste iuge is awake. This therfore is my cownsell / euen to do penance / that is turne quiklye and ernestly vnto owr Lord God / and to confesse our synnes to him / amend owr liues and to serue him in holines & rightwisnes / for these ar the frutes of a repentant herte / whiche herte thorow faith hathe now trwly cōsecrated and geuen herself ouer wholl to god.The way instituted of God to moue vs to repentance.

that in god onely we haue lyfe and saluaciō which is not apeaced with externe worshipings and workes dreamed oute of owr own headis. Then thonderforthe the feare of the terrible iugemente of god at hande and his present wrath and indignacion redye to be powred down from heuen vpon all vnright wysnes. If these things be taught and receiued and the wother impediments remoued / we be sone conuerted to god onely / workīg the very godly repentāce in the fere of god / or els is the axe layid to the root of the tree / that is to saye / destruccion and dethe daunse p̄sent before thy dore / so that now ther is no hope to the of any lenger life. For aslonge as there is anye hope of frute in trees / thei dunge the roots / rubof the mosse / kutof the sere branches / but it is the token of the laste desperacion of any frute whē the axe is laid to the root / to the root he saithe & not to the body or branches / signifying a soden remediles downfall. For the root kutt in sondre / the tree is dead. Repent ye therfore and receiue the gospell / or els stretcheforthe your neckis vnto the axe bent ouer your heades.

We be trees planted of the Lorde into this ende / euē to beare and bringforth good frute / that is good workis / yea and that by the heuenly iewce & moister of owr Lord Christe. These ar the frutes of the spirit / as faith and trwth &c̄ / of the whiche aftir Isaye had writē / Paul often times repete the same namely to the Galathens to the Ephe. &c̄.Isay. v.

Of all these wordis may we lerne the very trwe good workis to be requyred of euery of vs / and not figge leaues of our owne patching togither to kouer our shamful nakednes as did Adam and Eue / not the glittering shewe of godlines / but euē godlines innocency and christen religiō in ded. Agen we lerne herof the heuye vengeance of god to be redy prepared for all sinfull vngodlye men / yea and that the most certayn vēgeāce and wrath / left any man dirst promise himself to escape vnpunisshed for the contempt of the most highe God.

For this is once full of counforte / that christe came to call sinners to repentance and not thē that semed iuste in their own eyes. The pharisais / scrybes / and saduceis as ar now owr antichristē spiritualte with their captiued seculare / were the most desperate vngodly as Christe and Ioan bapt. well knew them / & yet thei both / exhorted them to repentance / Christe called them to him promising them forgeuenes if their penance were trwe. Let vs not therfore despeire of forgeuenes / nor castawaye and condempne a man neuer so synfull and cryminous except his synne be vnto death.i Ioā in the last chapt. For God our father is Ientle & of an infinite mercye constante and trwe of his promises as ye see in Iere. and Ezechie. xviij. chap. At laste that thou maiste knowe what is trwe repētance and to stere the ther vnto / let this be the diffinicion therof. Repentance

or penance is a turning or conuersion vnto the Lorde god / wherby we / of the syncere feare of god humbled / aknowelege our synnes / and all our whole life we make newe.Penāce what it is. This diffiniciō hath certain cheif principals / oute of the which / the hole nature of penāce shalbe fullier expressed and known. Fyrst thou hearest it called a turninge / and because it is not a turninge to what soeuer dead satisfacciō or creature thou lyftest / therfore is it added vnto the lorde god / for so redest thou it in Ieremye. Israel / if thou wilte be returned / be returned vnto me / saithe the Lorde.The turning to God. Here is excluded all turnings to saintis and to any wother creature / agene / here is included the turning away from lyes frō the deuill & the turning to the trwth. Where it is playne that here it behoueth to haue the doctryne of trwth which must shewe vs who is god to whom we must be conuerted / what is good & trwe / to the which we must be turned / and what is euill and false from whiche we oughte to be auerted / and to be breif what must be amended and howe. For this cause the prophetis and apostles exhortinge men to penance / longe and miche do cleaue / tarye / and labour in the descripciō of the nature of god / in his goodnes rightwysnes

verite & mercy / in describinge the lawes to liue wel and in the offices of men / and also in the sinnes of men to be accused opened and exaggered or throne vpō heaps as thus to be shewed many and greuous / then thei throwto threateninge & menacings laid before their eyes with the terrible and horrible syght of the iugement of god to be at hā

But this feare of god wherof we here speake is called syncere into the difference of that fear which casteth downe into desperacion. For syncere feare / out of herself bringeth forth euen the verye trew offices and dedis of repentance / namely the confession and aknowleginge of synnes. Nether is it enoughe to haue herde thy self to be a synner and god to be angry with the / onlesse thow confessest thyself to be euē siche one and offcest vp thy self standing before god in iugement / that is to saye onlesse thyself now humbled before god in his pre
