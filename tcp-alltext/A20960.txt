            To my Worſhipful
good Friend
M. George Hakewill, Batchelor
of Diuinitie, and
Fellow of Exeter
Colledge in
Oxford.
            
               
                  SIR, when you
firſt wiſhed me
to reade this
Diſcourſe, (cō
               mending
it as a worke, no
leſſe ſcholerlike then religious)
I was thinking how
I might ſome way requite
with ſomewhat more then
verball thankfulnes, your
kind fauors & good wiſhes

towards me. But hauing
peruſed the ſame, I
thought I could not better
employ my time of ſmall
emploiment, then to tranſlate
the ſame, as being a
ſubiect fit for all men ſeriouſlie
to meditate vpon,
ſupplying with my willing
but poore endeuour, that
which you could haue better
poliſhed; and I dare ſay
willinglie would, by reaſon
of your familiar acquaintance
with the Author, if
your leiſure might haue
ſerued you to haue taken it
in hand your ſelfe. Therefore
as you commended it
vnto me, for a peece neatly

and eloquentlie done in
the originall: ſo ſurelie it
did rauiſh me in the reading,
as being a moſt worthie
theame; and hath emboldned
me to recommend
it backe againe vnto you,
thus homelie apparelled in
our mother tong; in which
it can leeſe but litle grace,
being in it ſelfe ſo gracious
as it is. Suffer it therfore
I pray you (if it be not
too full of defects) to paſſe
vnder your name, who
beſt deſerue herin, if ought
there be deſeruing. For
mine owne part, I wil onlie
ſay, I haue ſtriued to ſhew
ſome part of the paines,

I would gladlie take to do
you anie pleaſing ſeruice
in requitall of your manie
fauours; which I will pray
you ſtill to continue, as I
will alwaies endeuor to be
thankfull, and constantlie
rest
            
               Your very affectionate
and much
bounden
Rich. Goring.
            
         
         
            
            TO THE HIGH
AND MIGHTIE
Ladie Anne D' Allegre,
wife vnto the high and
mightie Lord Monſieur
de Fervaques, Marſhall of
France, and the Kings
Lieutenant in Normandie.
            
               MAdame: The
Apoſtle vnto
the Hebrewes
teacheth
vs,
that within the Ark of the
couenant there was a cruſe
full of Manna and Aarons
rod.Heb. 9. 4. God thereby inſtructing
vs, that he hath not
onely a care of the nouriſhing
of our ſoules, but

to correct vs for our ſins
alſo: and that he hath giuen
vs together with the
bread of his word, his rod
of afflictiōs. The one nouriſheth
vs, the other exerciſeth
vs: the one inſtructeth
vs, the other reformeth
vs: the one teacheth
vs to do the will of God,
the other maketh vs to renounce
our owne: both
equally effects of his loue.
For God humbleth vs by
afflictions, and pricketh
the ſwelling of our pride.
He cutteth & loppeth vs,
to the end we may bring
forth the more fruite. He
filleth vs with bitterneſſe
in this life, to the end we
might long for the life to
come. For thoſe whom

God afflicteth grieuouſly
in this world, leaue it with
leſſe griefe. And indeed if
the childrē of Iſrael, being
come out of Egypt, after
hauing endured there ſo
many afflictions, did notwithſtanding
grieue, and
oftentimes mutined to returne
thither againe: how
much more had they grieued
if they had ſuffered
nothing? Adde hereunto,
that God who hath formed
vs to feare him, knoweth
that our prayers are
ſlacke and cold in proſperitie,
as proceeding from a
ſpirit that is cooled by
ſucceſſe, and which are endited
by cuſtom. The cries
which our owne will produceth
are feeble, in compariſon

of thoſe which
griefe expreſſeth. There is
nothing ſo ſtrong as neceſſitie:
nothing ſo ingenious
to pray well as ſorow,
which in an inſtant formeth
the ſloweſt tongues
to a holy eloquence, and
furniſheth vs with ſighes
which cannot be expreſſed.
It is not then in anger
that God afflicteth vs; but
becauſe that ſinne is a kind
of falling ſickneſſe, God
ſtriketh and afflicteth vs
to awaken vs. His beatings
are fatherly corrections: if
he vſed vs otherwiſe, we
ſhould not be his childrē.
For if a man ſeeing two
children a fighting, doe
chaſtiſe one for the ſame,
without touching the other;

the ſtanders by, without
further knowing him,
preſume that it is his father:
ſo God correcteth as
his children thoſe which
he embraceth with a fatherly
loue.1. Pet. 4. 17. 
               He beginneth
his chaſtiſings at his owne
houſe. Now if Ieſus Chriſt
(as ſaith the Apoſtle) hath
learned obediēce by the things
which he hath ſuffered,
               Heb. 5. 8. 
               although
he were the Son: how
much more ought wee to
bow downe our neckes
vnto Gods corrections, &
humble our ſelues in his
preſence, rather then to
kicke againſt the prick, or
to make the afflictions
which are bitter enough
of themſelues, to be yet
more bitter by impatiēce?

None can make a white
haire become blacke with
all his care: but well may
he make his blacke haire
becom white through his
vnprofitable diſcontent. It
is euer better to follow,
then to be dragged on, aboue
all when God conducteth
vs: for if the way
through which he leadeth
vs be thornie, yet is it
ſtraight.
            Now when I caſt mine
eye vpon all the remedies
of afflictions, I find there
are three things which
may aſſwage griefe; time,
reaſon, and the feare of
God. For length of time
mitigateth ſorow, and cloſeth
vp the wound, yea euen
in the weakeſt ſpirits,

and moſt vncapable of
conſolation: but reaſon eſteemeth
this remedie too
long, and vnworthy of a
couragious man; for wearineſſe
of weeping is a
poore remedie. The feare
of God doth more: for as
to appeaſe griefe, reaſon
ſtayeth not for time, ſo the
feare of God ſtayeth not
for reaſon; but before that
reaſon can bring in her
conſolations drawne from
the ineuitable neceſſitie of
euils, or from the vnprofitableneſſe
of teares, that
reſolueth promptly vpon
the loue of God, who chaſtiſeth
vs for our good: ſo
as in ſteed of caſting forth
complaints, it findeth out
occaſion of thankſgiuing,

and formeth not only vnto
patience, but alſo vnto
ioy, as acknowledging amongſt
his afflictions certaine
ſignes of Gods loue.
            Theſe documents Madame,
are ſo much the
more familiar vnto you, as
you haue had often experience
of them, and who
being paſt her apprētiſhip
in afflictions, haue carefully
ſought out the lenitiues
which Gods word doth
furniſh vs withall: which,
beſides that ſobrietie and
modeſtie which ſhineth in
you, and hath altogether
eſtranged you from the
vanitie which now a daies
reigneth in the world,
haue taught you to ſolace
your ſelfe with God. But

take heed alſo leſt you ſuffer
your ſelfe to be ouerwhelmed
with ſorow, and
make pietie the nurſe of
diſcontēt. Inueterat griefs
do often turne into habit,
and old wounds become
freſh with too much handling;
which me thinks is aboue
all verie vnfitting
your nature, whoſe meeknes
and gentlenes ſo pleaſing
vnto all, is much more
at accord with ioy. Shall it
be ſaid, that the great viuacity
of ſpirit which God
hath giuē you, ſerueth you
but to feele griefe more
ſenſibly? or that God hath
made you great, that your
teares might haue the
greater fall? Time which
eaſeth the moſt ignorant

people of their euils, cannot
it finiſh the ſighes of
a perſon whom God hath
ſo much enriched with his
knowledge? Shall it not
be better to ioy in future
good things, which are
great and certaine, then to
afflict our ſelues for euils
paſt, which are remediles?
Herein ſurely God is offended,
if in worldly croſſes
we find more occaſion
of griefe, then matter of
ioy in heauēly riches. And
wrongfully do we complaine
of our afflictions;
ſeeing we hurt our ſelues,
we doe vnderhand as it
were confeſſe, that God
hath not afflicted vs enough.
The Pſalmiſt ſaith
indeed, that God putteth vp

our teares into his bottels, as
precious things: but he
ſpeaketh of teares bred of
repentance, or of griefe, to
ſee God blaſphemed and
deſpiſed amongſt men. For
God gathereth not vp obſtinate
tears, which extending
themſelues beyond
their limits, occupie the
time due to conſolation.
How many times (giuing
your ſelfe to reading) haue
you bedewed the holie
ſcripture with your teares,
and yet this booke containeth
the matter of our
ioy? And in the booke of
Pſalmes, the tunes wherof
you loue, and yet much
more the matter, where
you ſee your own picture,
and the anatomie of your

inward affections: Haue
you not obſerued that all
the Pſalmes which haue
their beginnings troubled,
and whoſe firſt lines containe
nothing but profoūd
ſighes and broken complaints,
do end in delight,
and termes which witnes
contentment and peace of
conſcience? Let your tears
Madame, be formed vpon
this example, and let them
end in ſpirituall ioy. Let
your faith raiſe her ſelfe
from vnder her burthen,
and let the ſluces of afflictions,
which God hath
ſtopped her courſe withal,
make her to runne forth
with the greater impetuouſnes:
let her take ſtrēgth
from reſiſtance. Hereunto

the meditation of Gods
graces will much ſerue
you: the which if you coū
               terballance
with your euils,
they will mightily
weigh them downe. The
onely attention of future
glorie, which you apprehend
by faith, can it not
digeſt all bitterneſſe? That
faith which filled the Martyrs
with ioy in the midſt
of their preſent torments,
may ſhe not in our reſt
comfort vs againſt the memorie
of paſſed euils. And
you who acknowledge
what ſeruitude thoſe people
liue in, which are dragged
into perdition by the
inuiſible chaines of opiniō
and cuſtome: can you ſufficiently
magnifie the grace

which God hath giuen
you, in honoring you with
his alliance; and enlightning
you with his truth?
Yea, and in your life time,
how many of Gods aſſiſtances,
how many difficulties
happily ouergone?
God hauing giuē you the
grace to be alone in your
family an example of conſtancie
and holy perſeuerance
in the profeſſion of
his truth, hauing made you
great, that in the contradiction
of the world, you
might be an example of
firmeneſſe and conſtancie.
And yet admit your
wounds were more grieuous,
as taking all at the
worſt, our liues being ſo
ſhort, they cānot long laſt:

for you are not troubled
to ſeeke conſolations againſt
death, ſeeing that
death it ſelfe is a conſolation
vnto vs. For God if
he receiue the ſighs which
wee powre foorth in our
praiers, much more regardeth
he the ſighes which
our ſoules giue vp vnto
him in our deaths. Which
being a place of ſhelter,
and which putteth our
ſoules into ſecuritie, we
ought not onely looke for
his coming, but euen go
forth to meete him: haſtening
his comming by our
deſires, by the example of
S. Paul,
               Phil. 1. 23. who ſaith, that his
deſire tendeth to diſlodge,
and be with Chriſt. And to
ſay with Dauid:
               Pſal. 42. 2. 
               O when

ſhall I preſent my ſelfe before
Gods face? For our ſoules
being bound vnto our bodies
by two bonds, wherof
the one is naturall, and
the other voluntarie: if
through hatred and contempt
of life preſent, we
vntie the voluntary bond,
waiting the time when
God ſhall breake the naturall,
death then coming
ſhall find the buſineſſe begun,
and our ſoules prepared
to this diſſolution.
            Theſe cogitations Madame,
and ſuch like, haue
hitherto giuen you conſolation:
the which although
you be ſufficiently prouided
of, and haue alwayes
readie, many ſpirituall remedies,
yet you borrow

from other the receipts;
and haue thought that I
could contribute ſomething
to your conſolation.
And to this effect hauing
heard talke of ſome of my
Sermons vpon the Loue
of God, you would needs
make vſe of the power
you haue ouer me, demanding
them of me in writing;
knowing well, that
of the diſcontentments of
this life, there is no ſuch
gentle remouall as the
loue of God, or more
ſtronger remedy then that
he loueth vs. Herefrom I
drew backe a long time,
partly through idleneſſe
accompanied with ſome
other diſtractions: partly
through feare, apprehending

your iudgement,
which far ſurpaſſing ordinarie
ſpirits, feedeth it ſelf
not vpon vulgar meates.
At length, after long delay,
being not any longer
able to ſtriue againſt your
inſtant requeſts, which are
vnto me as ſo many commandements,
I haue let
this diſcourſe come forth
in publick, vnder the protection
of your name, to
the end that the imperfections
thereof may likewiſe
be imputed vnto
you, and that you might
beare alſo a part of the
blame, for hauing aſſiſted
at the birth of that which
ought not to haue ſeene
the light: but I ſhall be eaſily
excuſed, as hauing obeyed

you. For honor ſhal
it euer be vnto me, to execute
your cōmandements,
and to employ my ſelfe
to do you moſt humble
ſeruice, as being your
            
               Moſt humble and
moſt obedient
ſeruant

            CHAP. I. Of true and falſe Loue.
            LOue is that point
of our ſpirites,
whereby ſhe ioyneth
her ſelfe vnto obiects.
That which is
weight in heauie things,
Loue is the verie ſame
in our ſoules. For as
weight moueth earthly
bodyes towardes the
place of their reſt, ſo
loue moueth our ſoules
towardes that obiect
which promiſeth reſt &
contentment. Whereupon
it followeth, that

as heauie things doe
moue in a direct line towards
the place of their
reſt; ſo if we will attaine
vnto any perfect repoſe,
our loue muſt go right,
and haue an equall motion.
            1 True loue then is
that ſame,Seuen reaſons to proue that the loue of God, is the onely true loue. which giueth
reſt and contentment
vnto the ſoule; whereas
falſe loue is an irregular
agitation, and endleſſe
motion. Such is worldly
loue, which we ſee to
be filled with vnquietneſſe,
and not to ſtay his
agitation, but through
weariſomneſſe or deſpaire,

which is no reſt,
but an vnableneſſe to
moue, becauſe that
force failing, deſire doth
ſtill continue; like vnto a
tied horſe, which gnaweth
his bit. Such are almoſt
all men: they haue
many deſires, and little
power; they moſt deſire
that they can leaſt do:
neither being able to
obey or command their
couetouſnes. They cannot
obey it, becauſe of
their weaknes; nor commaund
it, becauſe of
their incontinencie. So
that if a man enioy,
without any let, that

which he loueth, that
verie eaſineſſe it ſelfe
bringeth him a diſtaſt
withal. For worldly loue
is enflamed by reſiſtāce,
and nouriſhed with difficulties:
like vnto thoſe
fiſhes which loue to be
in violent ſtreames and
floud-gates, but do die
in a ſtill water.
            The cauſe of this vnquietneſſe,
is becauſe
that our loue chuſeth
falſe obiects, and which
cannot ſatisfy couetouſneſſe.
For if you paſſe
your eie vpon all which
is beſt and moſt pleaſing
in the world, you

ſhall not finde therein
any firme and ſtable
quiet, but a chaine of
cares linked together, a
web of perpetuall vnreſt.
The moſt graue
ſweetes are ſow
                  •
               ed in
bitternes. The atcheiuement
of riches, pleaſure
and honour, is painfull,
and many periſh in the
purſuite therof: the poſſeſſion
is vncertaine, but
the loſſe certaine. For if
theſe things leaue not vs
by ſome accident, we
ſhall leaue thē by death.
Theſe are things which
are beſtowed not onely
vpon the wicked, but

euen becauſe they are
bad, as being rewards of
wickedneſſe. To expoſe
a mans loue towards
theſe things, is but a
purſuing of the winde,
and a perpetuall trauell.
For euen when theſe
things might be termed
alwaies good, yet are
they vncertaine. A man
cannot take good aime
at a flying fowle, nor
haue any aſſured deſignement,
aiming after
tranſitorie goods and
pleaſures. We muſt ſeek
our reſt then ſome other
where thē on earth,
and turne the edge of

our loue, towards heauen.
For euen as the lower
part of the elementary
region, is the ſeate
of windes, tempeſts and
earthquakes, but that
part towards heauen is
alwaies peaceable & ſtil:
ſo our loue ſhall be euer
full of vnquietnes, whileſt
it ſetteth it ſelf vpon
baſe things; but it ſhall
find reſt if it raiſe it ſelfe
towards heauē, & Gods
promiſes. And for this
cauſe is it, that in the
middeſt of tempeſtuous
wether at ſea, the needle
of the Compaſſe remaineth
alwayes vnmoueable,

and ſtayed vpon
one point, namely, be
cauſe it gouerneth it ſelf
by the Pole. In like ſort
the ſoule of a faithfull
Chriſtian, in the midſt
of the confuſiōs of this
world, & moſt grieuous
afflictions, ſhall enioy a
moſt aſſured peace, becauſe
his loue aimeth at
heauen, and ſtayeth it
ſelfe vpon Gods promiſes,
which is the true obiect
of our loue, which
alone is to be chiefly
loued; which can make
vs louely in louing vs,
and which alone can,
yea will make them

happie who loue them.
As the Apoſtle S. Paul
ſaith:1. Cor. 2. 9. 
               The eie of man hath
not ſeene, his eares heard,
nor hath euer entred into
his hart, what things God
hath prepared for thoſe
which loue him. Alſo he
promiſeth in S. Iohn: To
come vnto him which loueth
him,
               Ioh. 14. 23. 
               and to dwell
with him. Admirable
loue, which maketh our
ſoules to be the pallace
of the King of heauen,
and the ſanctuarie of his
Spirit.
            2 Philoſophie leadeth
vs hereunto at vnawares:
for it hath for a

generall Maxime, that
God and nature make
nothing in vaine. Now
this infinit deſire, this vn
ſatiable appetite which
is in man, ſhould be
in vaine, if there were
not ſomething to content
it; which being not
found vpon earth, muſt
be ſought for in heauen,
and towards God, who
is infinite goodneſſe.
            3 Adde hereunto,
that God hauing created
the world for mans
vſe, hath without all
doubt created man for
ſome better thing then
the world, to wit, for

God himſelfe.
            4 And that amongſt
all creatures, God hath
created man alone vnto
his Image, alone with
vpright ſtature, & viſage
erected vpwards, to the
end he might loue him
whoſe reſemblance hee
beareth, and that his deſire
and his loue might
aime at heauenly things.
            5 Adde we hereunto,
that the perfection
of our ſpirits cannot be
but in the vnion with
the Chiefe of ſpirits,
which communicateth
his vertue vnto the creature,
in like faſhiō as the

Sunne darteth out his
beames, that is, giueth it
in ſuch ſort, that it yet
dependeth vpon him after
hauing giuen it.
            6 Moreouer, true loue
is that which transformeth
the louer into the
thing beloued. Now if
a deformed man loue a
corporall beautie, neuer
ſhall hee by that loue
correct his owne imperfection:
contrariwiſe, by
louing God, we become
like to him, and as the
Apoſtle ſaith in the 2.
Corinth. chap. 3. Beholding
as in a mirrour the
glorie of the Lord with

open face, we are changed
into the ſame image.
            
            7 Finally, beauty being
the firſt ſparke of
loue, we ſhall ſee hereby
how that which we call
loue, is not ſo, but only a
ſuperficial colour which
couereth filth; but that
light is true beautie.
God then being the firſt
light, & father of lights,
is alſo the chiefe beautie,
and by conſequent hee
that we ought chiefly
to loue.
            Yet humane Philoſophie
diſagreeth here in
one point from diuine,
which is the word of

God. For naturall Philoſophie
holdeth, that
naturall motion is alwayes
better then that
which is againſt nature.
On the cōtrarie, in matter
of loue, the Scripture
teacheth vs, that the
loue contrarie vnto our
nature, is better then the
natural. For ſithence Sathan
by ſeducing Adam
hath disfigured the Image
of God in man,
mans deſires haue turned
towards the world,
and in a maner our loue
hath bene fallen headlong
downe from heauen
to earth. The affections

of the fleſh are
enmity with God.Rom. 8. 
               Rom.
8. If any one loue God,
it is not of his owne nature,
but it is a gift of
God. Wherefore our
Lord Ieſus in the eight
of Saint Iohn, ſaith, that
none can come to him if
his Father draw him not,
And the Apoſtle S. Paul
pulling vs out of the
mire and thicke mud,
commandeth vs to ſeeke
the things which are on
high. Coloſſ. 3. ver. 1, 2.
For the ſaying of the Apoſtle
S. Iohn is moſt
true, that we muſt loue
God becauſe he hath loued

vs first. This is alſo one
of the effects of the loue
of God towards vs, to
wit,Epheſ. 3. 19. 
               our loue towards
him. And there is nothing
that we ought to
demaund of God with
more feruencie, then to
haue the grace to loue
him: for this is vnto the
faithfull a witneſſe that
God loueth him: it is
the firſt effect of faith: it
is a moſt expreſſe trace
of Gods image: it is the
moſt liuely marke of
Gods children. This
loue is the ſoule of other
vertues, the rule of our
actions, the ſummary of

the law. This loue is the
vpholder of Martyrs,
the ladder of heauen,
the peace of conſcience:
yea, I dare ſay, it is a taſt
and a beginning of the
vnion and communication
which we ſhal haue
with God in heauen.
Our meditation cannot
chuſe a more excellent
ſubiect: for what is there
which is greater then
God, or more ſweete
thē his loue? The profit
likewiſe is no leſſe then
the ſweetneſſe: for men
are good or bad,Auſtins Enchiridion to Laurentius cap. 117. not
becauſe they beleeue,
but becauſe they loue.

Thoſe be good which
loue good things; and
amongſt good things
what is there like vnto
God? who not onely is
ſoueraignely good, but
who alſo maketh them
good which loue him.
Let vs then endeuour ſo
to do, and to be diſciples
vnto the holy Spirit,
which is loue it ſelfe,
and which will forme
our hearts vnto loue;
leſt we be deceiued vnder
this name of loue,
and leſt we ſhould take
for this true loue, a corporall
loue, an importunate
itching, a furious

heate, to wit, the worſt
of vices for the chiefe
of vertues, a brutall ſickneſſe
for an Angelicall
perfection.
            I know truly that he
who ſhall diſpoſe himſelfe
to loue God with
al his heart, & to neglect
all other conſiderations
in regard of his ſeruice,
ſhall neceſſarily incurre
the hatred of the world,
whoſe loue is enmitie with
God,
               Iam. 4. 4. as the Apoſtle Saint
Iames ſaith. But God
cauſeth this hatred of
the world to profite vs:
for as the Apoſtle ſaith,
All things together,
               Rom. 8. 
               one

with another, turne to the
good of thoſe which loue
God. Euils become bleſſings
vnto them, corporall
afflictions are ſo many
ſpiritual exerciſes vnto
them, the ſickneſſes
of the bodie are medicines
vnto their ſoules:
for in the hands of this
ſoueraigne Phyſitiō, verie
poiſon it ſelfe becometh
a medicine; his
ſtrokes are balme,Pſal. 141. 5 as Dauid
ſaith: and in ſuffering
for Gods cauſe, there is not
onely matter of patience,
but euen occaſion of glory.
They are like ſcarres on
the forehead, honorable

maimes, conformities
vnto Ieſus Chriſt, liueries
of a Chriſtian ſouldier.
And all through
the vnderpropping of
this loue, whoſe ſweetneſſe
tempereth this bitterneſſe,
and maketh vs
reioyce for his names
ſake.
            Some one will ſay,
that the loue of God is
an excellent vertue indeed:
but that to loue
him, we muſt know him
before, and that we cannot
know him in this
life, but with a ſlender
& obſcure knowledge.
This is true: but for all

this, we muſt not let to
ſtudy the ſame, we muſt
not ſuffer ignorance
to be cauſe of negligence:
for wee cannot
haue ſo litle knowledge
of God, but it will profit
vs, and ſtirre vs vp vnto
the loue of God. One
beame of his light is
worth the whole Sun.
A man were better to
haue an obſcure knowledge
of God, then a
cleare vnderſtanding of
naturall things. If a
beam of the Sun do enter
into an obſcure den
or dungeō, the priſoner
by this little ſnip knoweth

the beautie of light:
ſo the little which wee
haue of the knowledge
of God, is ſufficient to
giue vs a taſte of his excellencie,
and to inflame
vs with his loue. Moreouer,
the knowledge
which Gods giues vs of
himſelfe, is not ſo ſmall,
but it is ſufficient vnto
ſaluation: and the obligations
which we owe
vnto the goodneſſe of
God (the cauſes of our
loue) are fully repreſented
vnto vs in the word
of God, where the Apoſtle
Saint Paul herald
of the ſaid word, ſaith,

               That vnto vs is declared
all the counſell of God.
Acts 20. 27.
         
         
            CHAP. II. Fiue degrees of the Loue
of God.
            WE are ſo vncapable
of the loue
of God, that we are euen
ignorant what it
is. This herbe groweth
not in our garden; it is a
gift from aboue, comming
from the Father
of lights, who is loue &
charitie it ſelfe, as ſaith
Saint Iohn. It is a licour
which God powreth

into our ſoules by drops
as into narrow mouthed
veſſels. Wherefore to
deale with our ſelues according
to our owne
ſlowneſſe, we will endeuour
to receiue it into
our mindes by little and
little, and by eaſie ſteps
to bring our ſelues to
the higheſt degree of
loue.
            There are fiue degrees
of this loue; the loweſt
whereof being the moſt
imperfect, doth ſerue
notwithſtāding to raiſe
vs to the higheſt.
            1 The firſt degree
is to loue God, becauſe

of the good which hee
doth vs, and which we
hope to receiue of him.
            2 The ſecond degree
is to loue him for his
owne ſake, becauſe he is
ſoueraignely excellent,
and moſt excellently amiable.
            3 The third is, not
only to loue God aboue
al things, and more then
our ſelues, but alſo not
to loue any thing in the
world but for Gods
loue.
            4 The fourth is, to
hate our ſelues for Gods
ſake.
            5 Aboue all which

degrees, that loue of
God excelleth, wherewith
we ſhall loue him
in the life to come. A
loue which burneth in
the breaſts of Saints and
Angels, which ſtand before
his throne of glorie.
            We call theſe ſorts of
loue, degrees, and not
kinds; becauſe the higher
degrees containe the
inferiour: euen as the
moſt excellēt white differeth
frō other whiteneſſe
leſſe cleare, not in
kinde of colour, but in
degree: ſteps vpō which
wee muſt get vp, and

vpon each of them ſtay
a little our ſpirits.
            
               The firſt degree.
               THe firſt and loweſt
ſtep,To loue God for his bleſſings. is to loue God
becauſe of the good
which he doth vs. Vpon
this degree of loue was
Dauid, when in the 116
Pſalme he ſaith, I loue
the Lord becauſe he hath
heard my voice: and ſo
in the 18. Pſalme. For
God will be loued for doing
good vnto vs. It is
God which hath made vs,
which keepeth and guideth
vs, which nouriſheth

our bodies and inſtructeth
our ſoules; redeemeth vs
by his Sonne, gouerneth
vs by his holy Spirit, teacheth
vs by his word: maketh
vs his ſeruants, yea
his friends,Ioh. 15. 15. & Ioh. 17. 17. yea his children,
yea euen one with
himſelfe. Plato philoſophizing
vpon the grace
of God, according as he
was able, gaue thankes
vnto him for three
things. 1. For that he had
created him a mā, & not
a beaſt. 2. That he was
borne a Grecian, and
not a Barbarian. 3. That
not onely ſo, but a Philoſopher
alſo. We that

are inſtructed in a better
ſchoole, do otherwiſe
diſtribute our thankſgiuing,
and do praiſe him
for three things alſo. 1.
That amongſt all his
creatures, he hath made
vs men, created after his
owne image. 2. That frō
amongſt all ſorts of men
hee hath made vs Chriſtians.
3. That amongſt
thoſe which beare the
name of Chriſtians, he
hath made vs faithfull
ones. Herunto you may
adde if you will the 4.
that he hath adopted &
elected vs in his Sonne
before the foundation

of the worlde: hauing
had care of vs not onely
before we were borne,
but euen before the
world was made. For if
a woman lately conceiuing,
loue her future
fruite, much more doth
ſhe ſo when it is borne
and embraced in her
armes: ſo if God loued
vs before wee had any
being, how much more
when we call vpon him
and loue him with a filiall
loue? Now in this
grace, the leſſe our number
is, the greater is our
priuiledge, the greater
his bountie and mercie

towards vs, to be like a
few wel ſighted amōgſt
a throng of blind men;
like the portion of Iacob
in Egypt, alone enlightned
in the midſt of that
darkneſſe which couered
all the countrey: like
Gedeons fleece, alonely
watered with his bleſſing,
whileſt all the reſt
of the earth is drie and
deſtitute of his grace.
God hath enuironed vs
with examples of blindneſſe,
to the end wee
might make the more
account of light, and
that wee ſhould go on
in the way of righteouſnes

whileſt the day laſteth,
whileſt he enlighteneth
vs by his word.
               All theſe graces depend
vpon one ſpeciall
grace, which is our reconciliation
with God
by the death of Ieſus
Chriſt; it is he that is the
conduit-pipe, through
which the graces of
God do flow vnto vs: it
is Iacobs ladder, which
ioyneth earth vnto heauen,
which ioineth man
againe with God. The
Angels aſcending this
ladder, do ſignifie our
prayers. The Angels deſcending,
ſignifie Gods

bleſſings. Iacobs ſleeping
at the foote of this ladder,
repreſenteth the reſt
of our conſciences vnder
the ſhadow of his
interceſſion. For before,
on what ſide ſoeuer man
could turne his eyes, he
could ſee nothing but
matter of feare and aſtoniſhment.
If he looked
on God, he ſaw a conſuming
fire, and a ſoueraigne
iuſtice armed againſt
ſinners. If he looked
on the law, hee ſaw
the ſentence of his condemnation:
if on the
heauē, he ſaid, I am ſhut
out thereof by my ſins:

if on the world, he ſaw
himſelfe fallen from the
empire he before had ouer
the creatures: if on
himſelfe, he ſaw a thouſand
corporall and ſpirituall
infirmities. By the
ſignes in heauen, and
earthquakes, he was ſeized
with trembling and
feare: then Satan, death
and hell were the enemies
which either drew
him to perdition, or tortured
him with their apprehenſion.
But now
each man which hath
an aſſured truſt in Ieſus
Chriſt, looketh on all
theſe things with another

eye, and ſingeth another
ſong. If he looke
vpon God, he will ſay,
It is my Father, who
hath adopted me in his
Sonne. If he thinke on
the iudgement ſeate of
the laſt day, he will ſay,
My elder brother ſitteth
thereon, and he who is
my Iudge, is alſo my aduocate.
If he thinke on
the Angels, he will ſay,
Theſe are my keepers,
Pſal. 34. If he looke on
heauen, he will ſay, It is
my houſe. If he heare it
thunder from aboue, he
will ſay, It is my Fathers
voice. If he conſider the

law, he ſaith, The Sonne
of God hath fulfilled it
for me. If he be in proſperitie
on earth, he will
ſay, God hath yet better
things for me in ſtore. If
he be in aduerſitie, he
wil ſay, Ieſus Chriſt hath
ſuffered much more
hereof for my ſake; God
exerciſeth me, proueth
me, or correcteth me, or
rather honoureth mee,
making me like vnto his
Sonne. If he thinke on
the diuell, death, or hell,
then he will triumph ouer
all, ſaying with the
Apoſtle, 1. Cor. 15. O
death, where is thy victorie?

O graue where is thy
ſting? Thankes be to God
who hath giuen vs victorie
through Ieſus Chriſt
our Lord. If theſe things
buzze and keepe a noiſe
like angrie waſpes, yet
haue they loſt their
ſting. If the old Serpent
pricke our heele, yet is
his head bruiſed. If the
diuell through perſecutions
giue vs a falſe alarme,
yet belong we to
Ieſus Chriſt, who hath
bought vs, and none
ſhall ſnatch vs out of his
hand. Who wil feare hauing
ſuch a patron, who
not onely maketh interceſſion

for ſinners, but
of ſinners maketh them
iuſt? who not only pleadeth
for a bad caſe, but
alſo of bad, maketh it
good, becauſe that hee
doth not only pray, but
alſo pay for vs: ſo that to
pardon vs is not onely a
worke of his mercie, but
alſo an effect of his iuſtice.
               Theſe obligations vnto
the louing God, are
common vnto all the
faithfull. But I thinke, if
each one would looke
backe into the courſe of
his life, and call to mind
the time paſſed, there is

none of vs but ſhould
finde iuſt cauſe to acknowledg
beſides theſe
common benefites, manie
particular witneſſes
of the care and loue of
God towards vs: Of deliuerances
out of many
dangers, vnhoped for
good chances, commodious
afflictions, our
purpoſes croſſed, but
for our good, extraordinary
meanes to bring vs
vnto the knowledge of
his truth. Shall it be ſaid,
that the bleſſings of God
haue rained vpon the
ſands, without making
vs more fruitful of good

works? Shall we be like
vnto beaſts, which drink
of the brooke without
thinking of the ſpring;
without raiſing vp our
thoughts vnto God the
wel-ſpring of all bleſſing?
               Meane while, when
we ſay that God doth
vs good, to the end we
ſhould loue him: it is
not becauſe he hath any
need of our loue: but
becauſe he would ſaue
vs, he would that we
ſhould loue him; becauſe
it is impoſſible to
be ſaued whilſt we hate
him. Moreouer, our louing

him alſo, is partly
his gift; for it is he which
kindleth his loue in vs.
God doth not only giue
vs his graces, but giueth
alſo grace to demaund
them, the hand to apprehend
them, & grace
to make good vſe thereof:
the vertue to glorifie
him for the ſame, in ſuch
ſort, as to acknowledge
that we owe vnto him
not only thoſe his good
things, but euen our
ſelues alſo. God doth
good vnto the vnworthy,
but he maketh them
worthy by this doing
them good: his ſpiritual

graces being of ſuch nature,
as that they tranſforme
ſuch as receiue
them.
               This firſt degree of
loue being holy and neceſſary,
is not for all that
any more then a beginning
of the loue of God
and as the firſt ſtroke of
true pietie. For he who
loueth God but for his
profite, is like vnto little
children, who ſay their
prayers that they may
breake their faſts: and to
ſpeake properly, they
loue not God but themſelues.
Such a loue, if it
extend it ſelfe no further,

is a mercenary loue,
yea and iniurious vnto
God. For it may be alwayes
thought, that the
end is better then thoſe
things which tend therunto.
If then the loue of
God haue no other end
but our owne profit, we
place the ſame aboue
God, and make our intereſt
more exellēt then
his ſeruice. Let him
then which is come to
this firſt degree of loue,
if he paſſe on no further,
know that God pardoneth
vs much, if he puniſh
not that which is
grounded but vpon the

loue of our ſelues: wherfore
wee muſt mount
higher, and come to the
ſecond ſtep.
            
            
               The ſecond degree of
Gods loue.
               THe ſecond ſtep of
Gods loue,To loue God for Gods owne ſake. is to
loue him, not onely for
our profits ſake, but euen
for his owne ſake,
to wit, that laying aſide
all conſideration of his
benefites, yea and our
hope of any profit from
him, yet to loue him aboue
all things. Dauid
ſpeaketh of this loue in

the 69. Pſalme,Pſal. 69. 37 ver. 37.
Let all them which loue
thy name, reioyce. Hee
wold haue vs loue God
for his names ſake, that is
to ſay, becauſe he is ſoueraigne
Lord, wiſe in
his counſels, iuſt in his
actions, true in his promiſes,
dwelling in glory
which none can attaine
vnto, poſſeſſing a ſoueraigne
perfection. God,
whoſe life is without
beginning and ending,
his eternitie without
change, his greatneſſe
without meaſure, his
power without reſiſtance:
who hath made

the world by his word,
gouerneth it by his
ſight, and ſhall ruinate it
by his will: who in one
vertue and perfection,
which is his eſſence, incloſeth
all vertue, which
is euery where diſperſed
in the creatures; as diuers
lines which meete
in one center, do diſperſe
thēſelues by their
extentiō. For theſe conſiderations,
God ought
to be loued more then
for the good which he
doth vs. Ieſus Chriſt
himſelfe teacheth vs the
ſame, in the prayer he
formed for vs; in which

he appointeth vs to demaund
the ſanctifying
of his name, and the aduancement
of his kingdome,
before we craue
any thing for our profit.
A deſire which ſo poſſeſſed
the ſpirit of Moſes,
and the Apoſtle S. Paul,
that forgetting themſelues,
they deſired rather
to be blotted out of
the booke of life, and to
be accurſed, then that
God ſhould not be glorified.
               Wherefore to plant
in vs this loue, which loueth
God for his owne
ſake, it is neceſſarie to

know ſo farre forth as
we may, what he is in
himſelfe, and wherefore
ſoueraignly to be beloued.
               Wee naturally loue
beautie; now light is the
chiefe of beauties, without
which all other
beauties do nothing differ
from deformities.
God then being the
chiefe light, is neceſſarily
the chiefeſt beautie:
He is the Father of lights,
ſaith S. Iames. The fountaine
of light is in him,
and through his light we
ſee crearly, ſaith Dauid in
the 36. Pſalme. For this

cauſe, when hee firſt ſet
his hand vnto the creation,
he began with the
light, as a thing beſt repreſenting
his nature.
He is the Sunne of iuſtice:
the Sunne which
ſetteth not, which maketh
no ſhadow; vnto
which all things are
tranſparent: which not
onely enlighteneth the
eyes, but euen giueth
ſight. And iudge you
what this ſoueraigne
brightneſſe is,Pſal. 146. 8 ſeeing
that the Scraphins ſtanding
before the Throne
are dazeled,
                  Eſay 6. 2. 
                  and faine to
couer their faces with

their wings, as Eſay ſaith,
being not able to endure
ſo great a ſplendor.
For if at the glorious apparition
of the humanitie
of Ieſus Chriſt, the
Sunne ſhall be darkened
as ſome litle light at the
appearing of a greater,
what may be the ſplendor
of his Diuinitie?
               If you will conſider
the life of God,The life of God. ours is
but a ſhadow, and nothing
in compariſon.
For our life is a flowing
and ſucceſſion of parts:
but God poſſeſſeth his
life entirely at one inſtant,
and all at once. He

who wil know what the
life of God is in compariſon
of mans life, let
him compare the ſea
with ſome litle brooke.
1. The ſea is very great,
and the brooke very little.
2. The ſea budgeth
not from his place, but
the brooke runneth ſtill
forth, and is alwayes a
new water. 3. The waters
of the Sea come
from no other place; but
all running waters come
from the ſea, and return
thither. The like is the
life of God compared
with ours. 1. His life is
infinite, and ours verie

ſhort. 2. His life conſiſteth
in reſt, and to poſſeſſe
all his life at one inſtant:
but our life is a
fluxe, and ſucceſſion of
parts. 3. His life commeth
from none other,
but our life commeth
from him, Acts 17. ver.
28. and returneth vnto
him againe, as Salomon
ſaith in the 12. of Eccleſiaſtes:
The earth returneth
vnto the earth, as it
was before, and the ſpirit
vnto God which gaue it.
               
               Gods knowledge is
alſo a bottomleſſe pit.The knowledge of God, what it is.
He knoweth all things,
yea euen ſuch as are not.

Things paſſed, are not
paſſed vnto him: the future
are preſent before
him. He ſoundeth the
heart: he ſeeth through
the cloake of hypocriſie.
We behold things
one after another, but
he ſeeth them all at one
view: as if a man were
all eye, and ſhould ſee
all that were about him
without turning himſelfe.
We ſee things becauſe
they are: on the
contrarie, things are, becauſe
God ſeeth them.
For in God to ſee, is as
much as to will, and his
will is, to do. To know

things, we looke vpon
them: but God to know
things, looketh on himſelfe,
becauſe that in his
wiſedome hee hath the
models of all things, and
in his will the ſentence
of all chances.
               How admirable alſo
is his holineſſe!His holines. It infinitely
ſurpaſſeth the holineſſe
of Angels and
Saints: as it is ſaid in the
booke of Iob, chap. 15.
Behold, he hath no aſſurance
in his Saints, and
the heauens are not pure
in his ſight: how much
more abhominable and
vile is man, who drinketh

iniquitie like water. Euen
as the holy Scripture
calleth the higheſt heauen,
the heauen of heauens,
becauſe it incloſeth
the inferiour: ſo alſo
it calleth God, the holie
of holies, becauſe his
holineſſe incloſeth that
of all the Saints, as being
infinitely inferiour. The
holineſſe of the creature
is a qualitie: that of God
is his ſubſtance. God is
holy of himſelfe; but
men and Angels are not
Saints, but becauſe God
hath ſanctified them.His iuſtice.
               
               Alſo after a cleane
contrarie manner vnto

men, is he iuſt. For men
are iuſt, becauſe they do
iuſt things. In God it is
otherwiſe: for the things
are iuſt becauſe God
doth them. For he is iuſtice
it ſelfe. Wherefore
he is iuſt for no other
cauſe, but for that hee
doth according to his
wil: according to which
he hath giuen vs his law,
the perfect rule of iuſtice,
which he not only
ſetteth before vs, but alſo
writeth it in vs, and
engraueth it with his
finger in the ſtone, as he
promiſeth vs in the 31.
of Ieremie: I will put my

law into them, and will
write it in their harts. He
loueth iuſtice and truth.
He hateth the workers of
iniquitie, he rooteth out
liers, he hateth the bloud-thirſty
and deceitful man.
Pſal. 5.
               What ſhall we ſay of
his goodneſſe,His goodnes through
which he loueth them
which hate him, by
which hee cauſeth his
Sunne to ſhine vpon the
iuſt and vniuſt, the good
and bad: by which hee
raineth down his goodneſſe
euen into the
mouthes which are open
to blaſpheme him?

Aboue all, this infinite
goodnes ſhineth in the
perſon of his Son: This
Sonne ſo begotten before
all eternitie, that he
yet now begetteth him:
Sonne without beginning
of time, Sonne of
the like age as his Father:
Eſſentiall Word,
eternall Wiſedom, God
euerlaſtinglie bleſſed.
That Sonne which Eſay
calleth the Father of Eternitie,
                  Eſay 9.
would make
himſelfe the Sonne of
man, to the end that we
might be children of
God: yea was content
to be borne in a ſtable,

to the end that wee
might be receiued into
heauen; to be borne amongſt
beaſts, to the
end that wee might be
companions with Angels.
Hee who is the
Word it ſelfe, was content
to ſtammer as a
childe, to the end that
wee might ſpeake vnto
God in all libertie. He
who is the bread of life,
was content to be an
hungred, to the end we
might be ſatisfied. He
who is the fountaine of
life, was content to be athirſt,
to the end our
ſoules might be moiſtned.

Briefly, he who is
life it ſelfe, hath ſuffered
death, that hee might
giue vs life. All this for
vile creatures, yea enemies
vnto God, that he
might make them of
ſlaues vnto Sathan, his
owne children, and
tranſport them from hel
into his kingdom. Theſe
are the bottomleſſe pits
of the bountie & goodneſſe
of God, which do
gently ſwallow vp our
ſoules; there is pleaſure
to loſe ones ſelfe therein.
For theſe are the bottomleſſe
depths of the
grace of God, which

paſſe our vnderſtanding,
but doe recreate
our hearts; which giue
matter of admiration,
and alſo no leſſe ſubiect
of conſolation. Here are
the higheſt witneſſes of
his loue: here are all his
fatherly affections layed
open; all the riches of
that grace which the
Angels themſelues admire,
and as Saint Peter
ſaith,1. Pet. 1. & 12. 
                  endeuour to pry profoundly
into; louing in
this caſe the goodneſſe
of God, not for their
owne profit, but in reſpect
of God himſelfe:
for Ieſus Chriſt is not

come into the world for
their redemption.
               Now to what end
all this, but that wee
ſhould loue him who
hath ſo much loued vs,
and admire with ioy the
treaſures of his grace? O
God, as thy greatneſſe
is incomprehenſible, ſo
alſo thy bountie is infinite!
our ſpirits are ſtopped
with this contemplation;
our words are
beneath our thoughts,
and our thoughts yet
much lower then the
truth. We ſpeake of this
greatneſſe but ſtammeringly,
our praiſes do abaſe

thee, we draw the
picture of the Sun with
a coale. But ô God, raiſe
vp our ſoules to thee:
and if our ſpirits be too
weake to know thee,
make our affections ardent
to loue thee. Thou
who waſt pleaſed to be
our Father, touch our
hearts with a filiall affection.
Thou which giueſt
vs occaſion to loue
thee, giue vs alſo the
motions thereof. For, as
much as we are poore in
meanes, ſo much are we
vncapable to receiue
them, and to loue thee
after hauing receiued

them, if thou thy ſelfe
doeſt not plant thy loue
in vs.
               All theſe conſiderations
do raiſe vp our ſpirits
to loue God, not for
our ſelues, but for his
owne ſake: which appeareth
alſo in this, that
our loue to God cannot
be well directed, if it be
not formed vpon the
modell of that loue
wherewith God hath
loued vs. Now God loueth
vs for the loue of
himſelfe, as he ſaith by
the mouth of Eſay:
                  Eſay 43. 
                  It is
I, it is I, that blotteth out
thy ſinnes for mine owne

ſake. And it is the prayer
which Daniel maketh in
his ninth chapter, Lord
heare, Lord pardon, Lord
tarrie not, but haſten for
thine owne ſake; for thy
name hath bene called
vpon this citie, and vpon
thy people. God conſidereth
that we beare his image:
hee conſidereth
that wee are vnworthy
of his grace, but that it is
a thing worthy of his
bountie, to do good vnto
the vnworthy, and
which is more, to make
them worthy by doing
them good. He conſidereth
that his Church

is like vnto a flock which
carieth his name,Oſea 2. and is
called the people of
God; and therefore he
will not let it be Sathans
prey, nor a matter of triumph
vnto the aduerſarie.
            
            
               The third degree of the
loue of God.
               THe third degree
or ſtep, is ſo to
loue God aboue all
things; that we ſhould
loue nothing in the
world but for his ſake.
For example, there are
many perſons and many
things in the world

that wee cannot keepe
our ſelues from louing,
yea and it would be ill
done not to loue them.
So a father loueth his
children, a wife her huſband;
our kindred, allies,
neighbours and friends
haue part in this amitie.
So a man loueth his
health, his houſe, his
land, his ſtudie, &c. To
go about to diſpoſſeſſe a
man of the loue of theſe
things, would be an inhumane
doctrine, and
more then tending to
brutalitie. He is worſe
then an infidell that hath
not care of his familie,
                  
ſaith the Apoſtle. Pietie
rooteth not out theſe affections,
but doth huſband
them, and of miſtriſſes
which they were,
maketh them but handmaids
vnto the loue and
feare of the Lord. No
more then Ioſua would
kill the Gibeonites, but
ſubiected them vnto the
ſeruice of Gods houſe.
For then doth a father
loue his children as hee
ought, if in bringing
them vp, he purpoſe to
vſe them as mē do yong
plants, which ſhall one
day bring forth fruite to
the glorie of God. If he

ſo remember himſelf to
be their father, that he
be yet more mindfull
that God is his. Then a
man loueth his friends
as he ought, when he loueth
them becauſe they
loue God, and becauſe
hee ſeeth the image of
God ſhining in them.
So we ſhall then iuſtly
loue health, when wee
ſhall loue it, not becauſe
it is more gameſom and
without paine, but becauſe
it bringeth vigour
vnto our bodies, and libertie
vnto our mindes
to ſerue God in our vocation.
The like ought

to be ſaid of riches, of
honours, of knowledge,
things which one may
honeſtly loue; prouided
that their loue doe not
diſtract vs from the loue
of God, but may rather
thereto aduance & help
vs to performe good
workes. And as there is
not any ſo little brooke
but it leadeth vnto the
ſea: ſo let theſe goodneſſes
of God, ſeeme
they neuer ſo ſmal, leade
our thoughts to this
great depth of the
goodnes and greatneſſe
of God. Briefly, all our
liues and affections towards

our neighbours,
ſhal be well ſquared out,
when they ſhal be branches
& brooks of Gods
loue, and a reflection of
our ſight, which from
God glanceth vpon his
image. Neuer loue the
perſons for that which
is about them, but for
what is in them. Eſteem
not of men, as of purſes
for the money which is
therein. If you honour
a man becauſe he is well
clothed, by conſequēce
ought we to ſalute ſattin
in whole peeces. If you
account of a man for his
honours ſake, you tie

his dignitie to his titles
and to his habite: which
things being takē away,
there is no more of any
thing which ought to
be loued; as a horſe
which carieth an idoll,
which being takē away,
hath no more reuerences
done about him. On
the contrary, if you loue
a man becauſe he feareth
God, becauſe he is
firme in the faith, forward
in the knowledge
of God, true in his
words, iuſt in his actions,
charitable towards
the afflicted, burning
with the zeale of Gods

houſe, you ſhall neuer
want occaſion to loue
him. Take away from
him his goods, his honours,
yea his cloathes,
yea euen his bodie; all
theſe ornaments will remaine,
and that excellencie
which conſiſteth
in the image of God,
and the graces of his
Spirit.
               I am not ignorant,
that the ſecrets of mens
hearts are very deep; and
oftentimes the friends
which a man chuſeth
for vertuous, do becom
vicious, or elſe ſhew
they were neuer otherwiſe

In this caſe the
man which loueth God,
ought to reprehend his
friend, and to reforme
him if he can poſſible.
Flatterie hath takē away
from true friendſhip all
his termes, except the libertie
to reprehend. To
be afraid to chide ones
friend, leſt wee ſhould
offend him, is a reſpect
full of crueltie: as if whē
hee were readie to be
drowned, thou ſhouldſt
feare to catch him by
the haire of the head,
leſt hee ſhould leeſe a
haire or two. If by theſe
reprehēſions thy friend

do not amēd, the friendſhip
of a man muſt then
giue place vnto Gods
loue. We muſt do like
Moſes, who made vſe
of his rod whileſt it was
a rod, but fled from before
it when it became
a ſerpent. And yet in
this caſe it were better
to ſeparate our ſelues by
little and little, and to
vnſow friendſhip rather
then to teare it aſunder.
               Vnto all theſe difficulties
the loue of God
ſerueth as a rule. Many
heathen haue gathered
a number of precepts of
friendſhip, but haue not

diſcouered this ſecret,
which ruleth all their
rules, that is, to learne
firſt to loue God, and to
cauſe our friendſhips to
be deriued frō his loue.
Such as the braine is
vnto the ſinewes, the liuer
vnto the veines, and
the heart vnto the arteries,
that very ſame is the
loue of God vnto humane
friendſhips; that
is to ſay, they are but
threds and branches
which depend thereon.
This diuine loue not being
therein, friendſhips
are no friendſhips, but a
conſpiration; an accord

or agreemēt to diſagree
with God: friendſhips
grounded vpon pleaſure
or vpon gaine, which
ceaſſe when pleaſures
leeſe their taſte through
age, or when profite diminiſheth,
or is not equally
diſtributed: but
friendſhips groūded vpon
the loue of God, are
firme, becauſe they are
grounded vpon a ſure
foundatiō. Which loue
ought ſo far to aduance
it ſelfe, that for the loue
of God we ought not
onely to loue our
friends, but euen our enemies,
becauſe God

willeth it. Matth. 5. Becauſe
that amongſt theſe
enmities, ſome marks of
Gods image do yet appeare;
becauſe they are
as it were rods in Gods
hand for our amendment,
and inforcements
vnto his feare.
            
            
               The fourth degree of the
loue of God.
               WE are not yet at
the higheſt.To hate ones owne ſelfe for the loue of God For
we muſt come euen to
the hating of our ſelues
for the loue of God. For
euen as there is not in
man, any loue more

ſtrong or more naturall
then the loue of our
ſelues: ſo is it that ſame
which moſt reſiſteth the
loue of God, and which
is moſt vneaſy to be ſurmounted.
That which
the ſhirt is in our cloathing,
the ſame is the
loue of our ſelues in our
affections, to wit, that
which is laſt put off.
There we are to fight a
great combat: it is as it
were Sathans laſt intrenchment,
frō whence
he is vneaſily driuen away.
Yet none can loue
God as he ought, who
hateth not his owne nature;

who is not grieued
at his owne deſires, and
maketh not mortall war
againſt them, being deſirous
to finiſh this combat
by death, & to be diſſolued,
that he might be
with God: readie to be
prodigall of his bloud,
that he may be ſparing
of Gods glorie: waxing
wearie of this bodie of
ours, as of a mouing priſon
or portable ſepulcher.
Like vnto him that
being in priſon, looketh
through the grates, deſiring
his libertie: ſo looke
you not to get out at the
doore, you ſhall onely

get out through the ruines
thereof, by the deſtructiō
of this body: as
whē the priſon ſinketh,
& the priſoner eſcapeth
at ſome breach thereof.
Hee which ſhall haue
moſt made warre with
himſelfe, ſhall haue the
more peace with God:
he which ſhall not haue
pardoned himſelf, God
ſhall pardon him: he
which ſhall haue deſpiſed,Luk. 9. & 14.
yea hated his owne
life, he ſhall ſaue it.
               Here is the fourth degree
or ſtep of loue, and
the higheſt that man
can reach vnto in this

life. It was this degree of
loue, which made the
Apoſtle to crie out:Rom. 7. 24. 
                  Alas
miſerable man that I am,
who ſhall deliuer me from
the bodie of this death? It
was this degree of loue
which cauſed Dauid, hauing
a ſcepter in his
hand, being vanquiſher
of his enemies, and filled
with earthly riches and
honor, to acknowledge
himſelfe but a ſtranger
and way faring man vpō
earth.Pſal. 39. & 129. It is this degree of
loue which hath ſuſtained
Martyrs in their torments,
the heate wherof
hath bene hoter then

the heate of the fire: can
you think that they had
their muſcles of ſteele,
or bodies vncapable of
torment and paine? it is
not ſo. But as the heate
of a feauer drieth vp outward
vlcers, and a leſſer
heate is ſurmounted by
a greater: ſo the interior
heate of Gods loue did
ſurmount the heate of
the flame, and had more
ſtrength to ſuſtain them,
then paine had power to
preuaile againſt them.
Martyrs, whoſe vertues
do yet vnto this day ſuſtaine
our vices; whoſe
aſhes do yet heate our

coldneſſe; whoſe bloud
doth yet crie, ſpeaking
both for the truth of the
Goſpell, and againſt our
ſlackneſſe, who in a litle
time are ſo farre degenerate
from their conſtancy.
Surely if they do not
ſerue vs for an example,
they will ſerue vs for a
reproach and condemnation.
               Now to come to this
degree of loue, we muſt
haue a long and hard
combat: for our fleſh is
rebellious & mutinous,
and couetouſnes ſo rooted
therein, that to pluck
it vp (as witneſſeth the

Son of God himſelfe)
is as if a man ſhould cut
off a hand,Math. 5. or plucke out
an eye. And Saint Paul
alſo calleth our deſires
our members.
                  Coloſſ▪ 3. Notwithſtanding
God ſaith, that
he will make an end of his
worke in our infirmitie:
                  2. Cor. 12.
he maketh vs to be victorious,
but after many fals.
Oftentimes man being
placed as in a croſſeway,Gal. 5.
betweene the ſpirit
and the fleſh, betweene
the loue of God and the
loue of the world, hee
feeleth contrarie ſuggeſtions,
and a maruellous
combat. How many

times commeth it to
paſſe, that after the loue
of God hath had the vpper
hand, and that the
faithful hath reſolued to
be good, by and by his
deſires doe reaſſemble
thēſelues, & giue a new
aſſault vnto the feare of
God? The faithful being
thus aſſailed, either with
ſome appetite of reuenge,
of rapine, or luſt,
ſhall feele this loue of
God ſpeaking thus vnto
him in his heart: Miſerable
man, whither goeſt
thou? doth not God
ſee this? deſpiſeſt thou
his threatnings? reiecteſt

thou his promiſes? forgetteſt
thou thy vocation?
Wherfore wouldeſt
thou grieue the Spirit of
God? wherefore wouldeſt
thou bring a ſcandall
vpon his Church?
Where are the promiſes
which thou haſt made
him? where is thy mindfulneſſe
of his benefits?
Is this the way to the
kingdome of heauen?
Art thou aſſured that
being fallen, thou ſhalt
riſe againe? For a little
pleaſure mingled with
bitterneſſe, wilt thou
trouble the peace of thy
conſcience? For a little

porttage of herbes, wilt
thou neglect thy birthright?
At theſe ſuggeſtions
the faithfull wil ſtay
himſelfe, he will ſigh before
God; and like Sampſon,
he will breake the
bonds of his deſires:
but all is not yet done,
nor this rebellious fleſh
is not yet quelled. For
after theſe holy reſolutions,
we haue for certain
ſpaces, great dulneſſe againe.
Then the diuell
eſpieth occaſion, if he
ſee vs in bad companie,
if he ſee vs idle, if we
haue diſcontinued praier,
reading or hearing of

the word of God, then
our deſires doe rouſe
themſelues vp againe;
then the contrarie ſuggeſtions
of the fleſh and
the ſpirit ſtruggle together
for maſterie: which
maketh the life of the
faithful oftentimes ſeem
bitter, euen to the deſiring
of death to end this
combat. O miſerable nature,
enemie to it owne
ſelfe! ô ingrafted and
deepe rooted corruption!
O mutinous ſeditiō,
which woldeſt bring vs
back into Egypt: which
after our coming out of
Sodome, makeſt vs look

backe againe, like vnto
Lots wife; and makeſt vs
loth to leaue the euill
we are come from. Corruptiō
which troubleth
our beſt actions by bad
ſuggeſtions, and beſmeareth
them with
ſome euill. If we thinke
vpon death, our fleſh
ſuggeſteth vnto vs, that
there is yet time inough
to thinke thereon. If we
heare or reade the reprehenſions
of Gods word,
it perſwadeth vs that it
is ſpoken vnto others. If
we thinke of heauen, it
ſaith, we ſhal come time
enough thither. If thou

thinkeſt to giue almes,
it will ſoftly ſuggeſt in
thine eare, What know I
that I ſhall haue no need
thereof my ſelfe? If thou
wouldeſt reprehend thy
friend for his amendment,
it will draw thee
by a cruel reſpect, namely,
for feare of offending
him. Each good affectiō
hath as it were two eares
like a pot, by which the
fleſh and the world take
hold to hinder the execution
thereof.
               Here then wee muſt
carefully haue recourſe
to Gods aſſiſtance, and
imitate Rebecca, who

had recourſe vnto prayer
when two children
ſtroue in her wombe: a
moſt expreſſe figure of
theſe two men which
are in euery faithful perſon;
the one which is the
old, the other which is
the new man; the one
our corrupted nature,
the other the regenerate
ſpirit, which do couet
one againſt another, as
ſaith the Apoſtle S. Paul.
                  Gal. 5. 17.
Wherfore alſo God anſwered
Rebecca, The elder
ſhall ſerue the younger.
For the old man muſt
be ſubiected vnto the
new, vntill he be fully

ranked in due obedience
vnto God.
            
            
               The fift degree of the loue
of God.
               THere remayneth
now the laſt and
chiefeſt degree or ſtep,How the Saints in glorie, do loue God.
which is the loue wherwith
we ſhall loue God
in the glorie celeſtiall.
For we loue things according
as wee know
them. We ſhall therfore
loue God much more
then, becauſe wee ſhall
much better know him.
Now (ſaith the Apoſtle)
we know in part,
                  1. Cor. 13. 12. 
                  now we

ſee as in a glaſſe obſcurely;
but then we ſhall ſee face
to face. Our loue which
ſeeth from a farre off,
and which is diſtracted
by diuers obiects, ſhall
then ſee neare at hand,
and ſhall wholy be fixed
vpon God. And as whē
two great high ſwelling
riuers come to encounter
one another, they
make a maruellous inundation:
ſo the loue of
our ſelues and the loue
of God, are like two
ſtreames which neuer
ioyne themſelues together
on earth, but ſhall
meete in heauen. What

then ſhall the vehemencie
be of both theſe affections,
when they ſhal
be mingled both together,
and ioyned in one
loue? For then in louing
God, we ſhall loue our
ſelues, becauſe God ſhall
dwell in vs, and becauſe
that (ſaith the Apoſtle
S. Iohn) we ſhall be like
vnto him.
                  1. Ioh. 3. Nor are we
not to doubt, but that
the Angels and Saints
do loue themſelues ardently,
but with a loue
which diſtilleth from
the loue of God. O happie
and admirable loue
of ones ſelfe, which is

mingled with the loue
of God! Let vs forbeare
to loue our ſelues vntill
that time, and let vs loue
nothing in our ſelues
but what doth prepare
vs and entertain vs with
the hope of this loue.
               But becauſe this loue,
with which we ſhal loue
God in Paradice, doth
grow from the view &
contemplation of his
face, (for loue is kindled
by the ſight) let vs
learne what ſight this
ſhall be, that ſhall cauſe
this our loue. Our bodily
eies ſee things by two
meanes, either by receiuing

their images; for ſo
we ſee the bodies expoſed
to our view; or by
receiuing into our eyes
the thing it ſelfe which
wee ſee: ſo wee ſee the
light, which wee ſee in
ſuch ſort as that it entereth
euen into our eyes.
Now God who is the
chiefeſt of lights, will
make our ſoules to ſee
him in heauen in this
latter faſhion. For he
dwelleth in his Saints, and
is in them all in all. But in
this life he cauſeth himſelfe
to be ſeene by images,
that is, by the contemplation
of his works,

in which hee hath imprinted
a picture (as it
were) of himſelfe, and
the expreſſe markes of
his vertue. Therfore we
ſhal then ſee our God in
ſuch ſort as we now ſee
the light: but that now
we ſee it not but by the
windowes of the bodie,
that is, by the eyes: for
then wee ſhall receiue
throughout all our parts
the light of God, which
ſhall enlighten vs on all
ſides with the beames
of his holineſſe. Euen
as if a man were all eye
throughout, and ſhould
receiue light in himſelfe

on all ſides.
               This ſame ſight of
God, will make vs like
vnto God, as Saint Iohn
ſaith,1. Ioh. 3. 
                  We ſhall be like vnto
him, for we ſhall ſee him
as he is. For as a lookingglaſſe
cannot be expoſed
to the Sunne but it
will ſhine like the ſame:
ſo God receiueth none
to contemplate his face,
but hee transformeth
them into his owne likeneſſe
by the irradiation
of his light and perfection.Vrim & Thumim.
And as God is charitie
and loue it ſelfe,1. Ioh. 4. 8. as
the ſame Apoſtle teacheth;
it is neceſſary that

the creature being by
this view made like vnto
God, ſhould alſo be ſeized
with this loue, and
enflamed with this ſpirituall
fire. A fire which
hath giuen name vnto
the Seraphins, ſo called
becauſe of their ardour,
which is nothing elſe
but the loue of God, the
feruour of their zeale,
and their readines to do
him ſeruice.
               Here neceſſarily muſt
end theſe degrees or
ſteps of loue, and our
meditation can mount
no higher: it is the laſt
ſteppe of Iacobs ladder,

by which we mount vp
vnto God.
            
         
         
            CHAP. III. Of the markes and effects
of the loue of God.
            WE all make profeſſion
to loue
God, but few loue him
ſeriouſly. By this profeſſiō
we deceiue men, yea
we deceiue our ſelues,
but cānot deceiue God.
Wherefore it is neceſſarie
to bring hither the
touchſtone, to diſcerne
the true and pure loue
of God from the falſe,

and of baſe allay.
            As there are fiue degrees
of true loue, ſo are
there alſo fiue markes to
diſcerne it.
            1 The firſt mark of
the true loue of God, is,
that it quencheth all vnchaſt
loues.
            
            2 The ſecond mark
and effect of this loue, is,
that it bringeth peace and
tranquillitie to the mind.
            
            3 The third is, charitie
towards our neighbours.
            4 The fourth is, the
pleaſure to communicate
often with God.
            5 The fift is, the Zeale

of the glorie of God, which
reioyceth or ſorroweth according
as God is honored
or diſhonored.
            Whoſoeuer feeleth
in himſelfe theſe effects,
may aſſure himſelfe that
hee loueth God with a
true affection, yea although
that ſome coldneſſe
chance amongſt
this holy ardour, and
that the loue of himſelfe
be mingled withall; yet
this loue for being weak,
ſhall not let to be true,
prouided, it do dayly go
on tending vnto perfection.
Let vs runne ouer
againe each one of theſe

markes, that wee may
know them more perfectly.
            
               The firſt marke of Gods
Loue.
               THere are three ſorts
of loue:That vnchaſt loues muſt be extinguiſhed. the one
whereof, is euer good:
the other is euer bad: the
third, good of his owne
nature, but accidentally
bad becauſe of our bad
diſpoſition. That which
is alwayes good, is the
loue of God, in which
it is impoſſible to ſinne
through exceſſe: and in
this point it is good to

let ſlip the reines of our
deſires. The meaſure of
louing God, is to loue
him without meaſure.
The loue which is alwayes
bad, is the loue of
murder, of theft, and of
vnchaſte pleaſures, &c.
The loue which being
good of it owne nature,
becometh euill
by accident, is the loue
of meate, of drinke, of
eaſe, or recreation; appetites
which are naturally
good and neceſſarie,
but which we make
to be bad by exceſſe and
intemperance.
               The loue of God doth

diuerſly behaue it ſelfe
towards the other two
ſorts of loue. For it ranketh
the latter within the
limits of mediocritie, &
teacheth vs to ſatisfy our
neceſſitie, and not our
curioſitie. It reiecteth all
farre-fetched delicates,
being the diſtaſte of a
proud ſtomacke, which
awakeneth it ſelfe with
artificiall meanes: teaching
vs to nouriſh this
bodie, ſo that it may not
be a hinderance to the
ſoule: to watch and be
ſober leſt we enter into
temptation. As for the
ſecond loue, it can in no

wiſe remaine with the
loue of God: but the
feare of God doth wholy
cut it off, becauſe that
in a thing entirely bad,
we are not to ſeeke for
any mediocritie. None
can be a fornicator, an adulterer,
or a murderer
by meaſure; for the leaſt
inclination vnto theſe
things is ſinne againſt
God.
               But aboue all, the
ſtrength of Gods loue
is ſhewne in rooting out
of our hearts vnchaſte
loue, which kindleth in
the mindes of worldly
men a firebrand of filthy

deſires, which defile
our ſoules with a thouſand
beaſtly thoughts,
and importunate; which
of our bodies dedicated
to be temples of God,
make an infectious brothell,
and (as ſaith Saint
Paul) of the members
of Chriſt do make them
the members of a harlot.
Pleaſures which weaken
the bodie, coole the ſpirit,
and abate courage,
which after the ſtrength
is conſumed, leaue yet a
deſire. Infamous pleaſures,
which place men
beneath beaſts; of
which, man in this point

ought to learne the laws
of continencie and ſobrietie.
Traiterous pleaſures,
which embrace
men to ſtrangle them:
dally with him on the
lap of delight, as Dalilah
played with Sampſon,
that they may deliuer
him, not to the Philiſtians,
but vnto the diuell;
who hauing poaked out
the ſinners eyes, oftentimes
leade him this way
vnto the temple of the
Idoll. Yet as if this were
not enough, man hath
choſen out a painefull
way vnto his pleaſures;
they are not eſteemed

if not troubleſome. The
ſtollen waters are ſweeteſt,
ſaith Salomon; and
the malice of man ſuppoſeth
all other entries
better then the legitimate.
               The loue of God entring
into the ſpirit of any
one for to purge it,
doth preſently void out
this filth, and ſmothereth
vp this loue by his
greater force: which teacheth
vs to loue in our
neighbors, not their bodily
beautie, but their
ſoules ornaments. This
holy loue hauing for his
obiect the chiefe of ſpirits,What is true beauty
                  
loueth conſequently
in men their ſpirituall
beautie, a beautie which
cōſiſteth in the image of
God: an image, whoſe
principall lineaments are
iuſtice and holineſſe.
A beautie which is not
ſuperficial as that of the
bodie, which hideth
within it ſelfe bloud,
brain, and things which
one may not behold
without horror; but it is
a beautie which extendeth
it ſelf vnto the bottome,
as the beautie of a
diamond, or of the light
it ſelfe. The beautie of
the body, is but a flower

which is withered with
age; but the beautie of
the ſoule is not ſubiect
vnto time; and which
is more, the wrinkles
which it hath, are done
out with time. Many
women might haue bin
more happie if they had
bene leſſe beautifull; for
their beautie hath plentifully
afflicted them:
but ſpirituall beautie is
alwayes accompanied
with Gods bleſſing. Beſides,
conſider attentiuely
the faireſt viſage
of the world, and you
will becom neuer a whit
the more faire your ſelf,

but ſhall rather ſeem the
fouler being neare it.
But carefully to contemplate
a ſoule which
God hath embelliſhed
with vertue, will make
you become vertuous,
and will forme you according
to his example.
Carnall eyes perceiue
not this beautie, and
pleaſure knoweth not
what it is. For, as a horſe
louing a mare, thinketh
that in the world there
is no other beautie: ſo
the carnall and ſenſuall
man thinketh there is
no other beautie but
that which through the

ſight toucheth his deſires.
But the view of the
faithfull pierceth further,
and oftentimes
cleane through a corporall
beáutie, ſeeth the vetie
image of the diuell.
Cōtrariwiſe, the inward
beauty is oftentimes vnder
an exteriour fouleneſſe,
as that of a ſlubbered
diamond. As that
of Ieſus Chriſt during
his opprobrious handling;
whereof Eſay in the
53. chap. ſaith, that there
was not in him either
forme or beautie: and
yet in the 45. Pſalme, he
is called the moſt faire

amongſt the ſonnes of
men. As the beautie of
the Church, whereof it
is ſaid in the firſt of
Canticles, that ſhe is
browne, and yet faire;
being blacke without,
and burnt with afflictions,
which notwithſtanding
blot not out
her inward beautie.
               Therfore that women
curious of their beautie,
may rather ſtudie to adorne
themſelues inwardly,
as it is ſaid in
the 45. Pſalm, The Kings
daughter is full of glorie
within: Let them take
heed leſt in decking artificially

their bodies,
they become a ſnare of
deſires, an inſtrument in
the diuels hand. A ſouldier
hauing a ſword that
hath ſurely ſerued him
in many combats, will
be careful to ſcowre and
poliſh it: and doe wee
maruell if the woman
hauing ſerued Sathan to
ouerthrow Adam, be
carefully decked & embelliſhed
by him; and
that women are ſo curious
in ornaments, by
the ſuggeſtion of the diuell?
               But we whom God
hath honored with his

knowledge, to the end
we might be inflamed
with this loue, let vs ſhut
our eyes to theſe allurements,
poſſeſſing (as
ſaith Saint Paul) our veſſels
in holineſſe: abſtain
your ſelues not onely
from euill, but alſo from
all appearance and occaſions
of euill. Eſchue
idleneſſe, for it is the pillow
of vices. Let Satan,
coming to aſſaile you,
find you euer occupied.
Flie bad companie, filthy
talke, books of loue;
for they are fire-brands
of luſt, the hookes and
baits of the diuel. None

cometh to do euill but
by theſe acceſſaries, yea
the euill is alreadie in
theſe acceſſaries. Many
will ſay, that they are
chaſt of bodie, but their
eyes, their eares, and
their thoughts are culpable
of luſt. Yet Chriſt
ſaith, that he who looketh
on his neighbours
wife to luſt after her,
hath already committed
adultery. The beſt companie
and the beſt buſines
to diuert our minds
from this euill, is the
carefull reading of the
word of God ioyned
vnto prayer. Saint Auguſtine
                  
in the eight book
of his Confeſſions, cap.
8. & 12. ſaith, that when
he was vpon termes of
rendering himſelfe a
Chriſtian, that which
moſt troubled him, was,
that hee muſt leaue his
fornication; and that in
this combatfull anguiſh,
hee withdrew himſelfe
into a garden, where
twice he heard the voice
of a child, as it were, coming
from the houſes
hard by, ſaying, Take
and reade. At this voice
he tooke the booke of
the Epiſtles of S. Paul,
and chanced at the firſt

opening of the booke,
on this text of the 13.
chapter to the Romains,
where he ſaith: Let vs
walke honeſtlie as in the
day time, not in riot and
drunkēneſſe, not in chambering
and wantonneſſe,
neither in ſtrife or enuie;
but put you on the Lord
Ieſus Chriſt, and haue no
care of the fleſh to fulfil the
luſts thereof. There was
enough for him: and
thereupon, were it that
this voice came from
God, or that it chanced
by other meanes, he reſolued
to follow the
counſell of the Apoſtle,

who without looking
for any reuelation therupon,
doth ſufficiently
manifeſt vnto vs the wil
of God touching the
laying off of theſe deſires.
            
            
               The ſecond marke of the
loue of God.
               THis ſame loue bringeth
forth another
effect,Peace and tranquility of the ſoule. by which it is to
be knowne, to wit, the
peace and tranquillitie
of the ſoule: it chaſeth
away feares, aſſwageth
cares, ſweetneth afflictions.
For what euill ſoeuer

happeneth him who
loueth God, he wil euer
remember the ſentence
of the Apoſtle, Rom. 8.
That all things turne to
the best for them which
loue God. Euen their
croſſes becom bleſſings;
their bodily pouerty is a
ſpiritual diet vnto them;
their baniſhments teach
them to leaue the world:
their ſequeſtring from
honors is their approch
vnto God: their enemies
are their Phyſitions,
cauſing them to be
warie, and to liue in
Gods feare. Their corporall
diſeaſes are ſpirituall

cares: death is an
entrie into life, and a
bringing forth, by which
the ſoule is deliuered of
the bodie, as of her laſt
after-birth; and cometh
forth of a darke den, to
enter into Gods light.
The paſſage through afflictions,
reſembleth the
paſſage of the red ſea;
for the wicked are ouerwhelmed
therein, they
are vnto them forerunners
of damnation; but
the faithfull and Gods
people finde that way a
paſſage vnto the land of
promiſe.
               This verie ſame loue

of God, will ſuggeſt vnto
the faithfull this
thought: Seeing that I
loue God, it is certaine
that he loueth me. For
Saint Iohn ſaith,1. Ioh. 4▪
                   that we
loue him becauſe he loued
vs firſt. For I had not naturally
in me any inclination
to loue him; but
it was hee who louing
me, framed my heart to
loue him. Now if God
loue mee, he intendeth
my good; and he can do
all that he will, nothing
hapneth but according
to his will. He will not
then permit that any euill
happen me; he will

turne my euils vnto
good for my ſaluation:
he will leade me thereunto,
through a way
thornie vnto fleſh, but
healthfull to my ſoule.
Briefly, the loue of God
excludeth feares, and is
the prop of our aſſurance,
as ſaith the Apoſtle
Saint Iohn:
                  1. Ioh. 4 3. 
                  There is
no feare in charitie, but
perfect charitie driueth
forth feare. This ſame
loue ſweetneth afflictions,
and maketh our
Lords yoake eaſie and
tollerable. For you ſhall
ſee by experience, that
in a houſe where loue

is great betweene the
husband and the wife,
they paſſe the bad time
ouer with content, and
haue mutuall conſolatiō
one of another: yea, to
haue a faithfull friend,
into whoſe boſome you
may ſhed your teares,
and powre forth your
complaints, doth bring
a man much eaſe, although
it bring no remedy.
How much more
ſhall the faithfull ſoule
find & feele in the loue
of his God? of God,
who not onely knoweth
our euils, counteth
our ſighes, layeth vp our

teares in his veſſels; but
who can and will remedie
them: and not onely
remedie them, but turne
them to good; giuing vs
in our afflictions, not
onely occaſion to ſuffer,
but euen matter of reioycing.
So the faithfull
ſpeake in the 46. Pſalm:
Let the waters of the ſea
make a noiſe, and let the
mountaines ſhake by the
riſing of his waues: in the
meane time the brookes of
the riuer ſhall reioyce the
city of God. Theſe trobleſome
waters are the people
banded againſt God,
as is expounded in the

Apocalypſe, chapter 17.
Theſe brookes which in
the meane time do reioyce
the holy citie, are
the inſtructiōs of Gods
word, whoſe voice is
our conſolation. For in
his afflictions the faithfull
will turne aſide his
eyes from his enemies,
and from all ſecond cauſes,
and will ſay: Lord, it
is thou that haſt done it;
I receiue this affliction
at thy hand; make this
proue healthfull vnto
me, and permit not that
I euer come to murmur
againſt thee, or to kicke
againſt the pricke. We

ſwallow with the better
reſolution a bitter potion,
when it is preſented
vs by a friendly hand,
whoſe ignorance or falſhood
we feare not. We
finde all theſe things in
God, who moreouer
maketh venomes themſelues
to prooue good
medicines.
               So the loue of God
is a retraite and ſhelter
againſt all anguiſh: it is
the groūd of true peace:
it is the prop of our aſſurance,
which cauſeth
vs to deſpiſe the threatnings
of men; to looke
on the enterpriſes of

great men, and the riſings
of people with diſdaine;
which cauſeth vs
to find eaſe on the rack,
and to looke on deaths
face with aſſurance, and
take off his maske to ſee
Ieſus Chriſt, which cometh
vnto vs vnder that
ſhew: which maketh the
faithful to ſtand vpright
in the middeſt of the ruines
of his country. This
holy loue made S. Paul
to ſay, Rom. 8. If God be
with vs, who ſhall be against
vs? He which hath
not ſpared his owne Sonne,
but deliuered him ouer for
vs, how ſhall not he giue

vs all things with him?
Let vs likewiſe ſay, He
that laieth vp our teares,
wil not he gather vp our
prayers? He, without
whoſe prouidēce a ſparrow
lighteth not on the
ground, wold he permit
that our ſoules ſhould
fall into hell for lacke of
caring for them? Hee
who extendeth his care
to gather vp our teares,
yea to count our haires,
how much more care
will hee haue of our
ſoules, for which his
Sonne hath died? This
ſame loue made Dauid
ſay, Pſal. 23. Euen when I

ſhould walke in the way
of the ſhadow of death, I
would feare none euill, for
thou art with me, thy rod
and ſtaffe do comfort me.
               
               Hereby we may iudge
what difference there is
betweene louing God
and men. Let vs not
ſpeake of the weakneſſe
of our friends to deliuer
vs, their little conſtancie
in their loue, yea and of
the cruel officiouſnes of
ſome friends, who deſire
to ſee their friends in
trouble, to make them
beholding vnto them
for ſuccouring them.
And let vs talke that

which is beſt and honeſteſt
in our friendſhips.
I ſay then, if there be any
one who loueth a
douzen perſons faithfully,
he muſt then neceſſarily
be miſerable:
for it is a very likely matter,
that one of a douzen
perſons will euer be in
trouble, or ſicke, or afflicted.
If then a man
ſhall according to the
lawes of friendſhip participate
of his friends afflictions,
ſhall he not by
hauing many friends, be
in perpetuall miſerie?Loue is a thing full of care and feare.
And if any one of them
be abſent, it is a ſubiect

of continuall apprehenſion.
So that many are
of opinion, that to be
obdurate, and without
compaſſion, is commodious.
Faithfull friendſhips
are kindes of ſickneſſes
ingenious to
feare, and which from
diuers parts draw vnto
themſelues griefe and
compaſſion. The loue
of God hath none of
theſe incōmodities: for
we loue him for whom
we can be in no feare,
and who puts vs out of
all feare for our ſelues,
and warranteth vs from
all euill.
               
                  
Now if the loue of
God be ſo full of reſt, in
compariſon of the moſt
faithful & honeſt friendſhips
amongſt mē; how
much more then in
compariſon of vnhoneſt
loues, which torture the
conſcience, which hide
themſelues for ſhame;
where ſpending, riot, ielouſie,
lyings in waite,
& alteration of humors,
torment the mind with
a perpetuall vnquietnes?
            
            
               The third marke of the
loue of God.
               IN the third place,The loue of our neighbour. the
loue of God is manifeſted

by the loue of
ones neighbor. It is impoſſible
to loue God, &
hate his image; to loue
Ieſus Chriſt, who is the
head, & hate our neighbours
who are his members:
it were as if a man
kiſſing another ſhould
tread on his toes; things
vnſufferable: as ſaith the
Apoſtle Saint Iohn:
                  1. Ioh. 4. 20. 
                  He
who ſaith, he loueth God,
and hateth his brother, is
a lier: for who ſo loueth
not his brother whom he
ſeeth, how can he loue God
whom he hath not ſeene?
That is to ſay, if he haue
not ſo much as naturall

loue, how can he haue
the ſupernatural? Wherfore,
in the ſummarie of
the law expreſſed in the
Goſpell, vnto the loue
of God is adioyned the
loue of our neighbor, as
a neceſſary conſequent,
& an vndoubted proofe.
And the Apoſtle S. Paul
ſaith,Gal. 5. 14. that all the law is accompliſhed
in this word alone,
Thou ſhalt loue thy
neighbour as thy ſelf. Not
that it is enough to loue
ones neighbour without
louing God; but becauſe
the loue of ones
neighbor doth neceſſarily
preſuppoſe the loue

of God.
               Now if we ought to
loue our neighbours for
Gods ſake, it followeth
that aboue all we ought
to loue thoſe which
loue God: following the
commandement of the
Apoſtle vnto the Galathians,
chap. 6. Let vs do
good vnto all, but principally
vnto the houſhold of
faith; with whom we
haue many good things
in common, to be together
children of one Father,
and likewiſe brethren
of Ieſus Chriſt;
nouriſhed with the ſame
meate, which is the

word: of one houſhold,
namely the Church: trauellers
and pilgrims together,
combattants for
one ſelfeſame cauſe, called
vnto one ſelfeſame
hope, coheires of one
ſelfeſame kingdom. All
which are conſideratiōs
reſembling many lines,
which doe all meete in
one point: for theſe are
obligations to loue one
another, who doe all of
vs meete in Ieſus Chriſt,
in whom we are all one,
becauſe we are one with
him.
               This charity amongſt
the faithfull, is extended

two wayes. The one is
the charitable relieuing
of our afflicted brethrē.
The other is, peace and
concord amongſt our
ſelues.
               As touching our brotherly
reliefe, it neceſſarily
commeth from the
loue of God, as S. Iohn
ſaith:1. Ioh. 3. 17. 
                  Who ſo ſhall haue
goods in this world, and
ſee his brother in neceſsitie,
and ſhall ſhut vp his
compaſsion,
                  Brotherly reliefe. 
                  how ſhall the
loue of God dwell in him?
Alſo, God appointeth
himſelfe a rewarder of
almes, as done vnto him
ſelf, yea euen vnto a cup

of cold water, Math. 10.
To giue vnto the poore, is
to lend out money for vſurie
vnto God. Prouer. 19.
Of all that we poſſeſſe,
wee ſhall ſaue nothing
but that which we ſhall
haue thus giuen. By this
meanes (ſayth Ieſus
Chriſt in Luke 16.) we
make our ſelues friends,
which ſhal receiue vs into
the euerlasting tabernacles.
Thou feareſt to leeſe
thy money by giuing it;
and yet the beſtowing it
in almes, is the meanes
to keepe it. Thou feareſt
to leeſe thy mony by giuing
it, and feareſt not

to leeſe thy ſelfe by keeping
it. For our goods auariciouſly
reſerued, are
not only ſpoiled, but do
alſo ſpoile and corrupt
our ſpirits. It will be for
this ſinne that God will
iudge the wicked at the
latter day. Math. 25. The
wicked rich man, who
deſpiſed the poore Lazarus
crauing a morſell
of bread, doth now beg
of Lazarus a droppe of
water to allay his heate.
An heate begun by the
retentiō of thoſe goods
which were due to the
poore: which (as Saint
Iames ſaith) ſhal conſumeIames 5.
                     
the fleſh of the rich like
fire: and are as a treaſure
gathered for them againſt
the latter day. And iuſtly
are they ranked with
murderers. For as there
is two wayes to put
out a lampe, either
by blowing it, or not
powring in oile in good
time: ſo the couetous
man, if he take not away
the life of the poore by
killing him; at leaſt he
ſuffereth him to wither
and drie away for lacke
of powring into him
ſome liberalitie.
               The roote of this dutie,
is the loue of God,

which redounds vpon
his members: wherfore
alſo, as the loue of God
is free and voluntarie; ſo
alſo muſt not our almes
be forced or vnwillingly
done, but free and voluntarie.
God loueth a
cheerfull giuer, 2. Cor. 9.
7. ſaith the Apoſtle Saint
Paul. And to this purpoſe
he calleth there in
that ſame place almeſdeeds
a ſeede. A ſeed
which wee caſt in the
earth, but gather the
crop in heauen. Seeing
then wee muſt giue
cheerfully, it is here the
contrarie of that which

is ſaid in the 126. Pſalm:
Thoſe which ſhall ſow in
teares, ſhall reape in ioy
and triumph. For hee
who ſhal ſow this reliefe
with teares, ſhall reape
with griefe. None ſhall
reape with ioy in heauen,
if he haue not ioyfully
ſowed vpon earth.
An almes giuen vnwillingly,
doth not onely
leeſe all reward, but alſo
deſerueth no pardon. It
fareth alike with almes
which are vaingloriouſly
giuen, and to be ſeene
of men, which our Lord
condemneth in the 6. of
Matthew. Alſo it fares

alike with almes done of
goods ill gotten; who
hauing enriched himſelf
by fraudulent meanes
and extortion, thinks to
appeaſe God by giuing
part of his robberies in
alms, goes about to corrupt
God with preſents,
& cal him to take part of
the ſpoile. As in the law,
God receiued not as an
offring, neither the price
of a dog, nor the hire of
the letcher: ſo in the
Goſpell, God will that
almes (which the Apoſtle
to the Hebrews calleth
a ſacrifice) ſhould
be of iuſt things,Heb. 13. 16. and

gotten by labour: that
he who hath ſtollen, ſteale
no more, but rather labor
with his hands, that he
may haue to giue vnto
him that hath neede. Epheſ.
4. Wherfore when
Ieſus Chriſt in the 16. of
S. Luke, wil that we giue
almes of vniuſt riches;
hee calleth riches there
euill, not becauſe they
were vniuſtly gottē, but
becauſe that ordinarily
they are enticements &
baits of iniquitie; otherwiſe
hee would ſooner
haue commanded them
to be rendered vnto
ſuch as they had bene

wrongfully taken from.
               This ſame loue of
God,Agreement among brethren. produceth peace
and concord amongſt
brethren. For it is impoſſible
to loue God,
without imitating him.
Now he is the God of
peace. Rom. 16. Wee
muſt therefore be children
of peace, in imitation
of him: for ſo are
the faithful called in the
10. of Luke. To this purpoſe
in the 19. of the firſt
of Kings, God is repreſented
as not being in
the ſtorme and boiſterous
winde, but in the
ſtill and quiet ſound; becauſe

God is not amongſt
confuſions and
quarrels, amongſt perſons
which eate vp one
another, but amongſt
thoſe which be at peace
and vnitie. But the diuel
liueth vpon diſcord, and
is friend vnto ſtrife. Euen
as men cauſe two
dogges or two cocks to
fight together for pleaſure,
the lookers on encouraging
them to the
combat: ſo doubt you
not, but when two men
fight together, the diuel
pricketh them on, and
taketh pleaſure thereat.
Let vs take heed leſt before

we be aware, we
make our ſelues the diuels
bable or paſtime.
We (I ſay) that be brothers,
who haue all the
world on our skirts;
who by one ſelfe ſame
combat, do tend to one
ſelfe ſame hope: called
to repaire the breaches
of Ieruſalem, to build againe
the houſe of God
in the view and deſpite
of the diuel. It is written
in the 1. of Kings, chap.
6. that Salomons temple
was builded without any
noiſe, there was not
one ſtroake of a hammer
heard. Let vs labour

in the worke of God
without any noiſe, and
without ſtrife. And here
may and ought to be remembred
the aduertiſement
which Ioſeph gaue
to his brethren, at their
going out of Egypt, to
return to their father; he
ſent them away, and ſaid
vnto them,Gen. 45. 24. 
                  Fall not out
by the way. For what is
the life of a faithful man
but an iſſue out of Egypt,
a voyage to return
home to our father? Let
vs not quarrell then on
the way, let vs liue in
peace, and the God of
peace will remaine with

vs; whom we ſhall loue
the more ardently, whē
we are ioyned in affections
for to loue him.
            
            
               The fourth marke of the
Loue of God.
               WE preſume that
ſuch are friends
whom wee ordinarily
ſee together.Often communication with God. Communication
and familiarity
are the nurſes of friendſhip,
yea more then
good turnes. He which
doth a pleaſure with a
ſeueritie, withdrawing
his companie from all;
who giueth with a refuſing

countenance, like
one that ſhould fling his
bread at a beggers head,
doth vnbind in binding,
and is paied wel enough
if his benefits be pardoned.
Friendſhip alſo requireth,
that a friend
ſhould in all things be
aduiſed by his friend,
diſcharge vnto him his
cares, diſcouer his ſorrowes,
and powre all his
griefe into his boſome,
to take counſell of him
if there be any remedie,
and to eaſe himſelfe if
there be none. This is
then alſo one of the
markes of the loue of

God, to wit, a frequent
communication, by the
which the faithful Chriſtian
doth counſell or
conſolate himſelfe with
God.
               For the man which
loueth God, being to
deliberate vpō any thing
of importance, doth firſt
conſult with the oracle
of Gods mouth, and enquireth
after his will. As
for example, vpon the
choiſe of religion, he wil
not call the belly to coū
                  ſell,
nor worldly hopes;
he will not imitate the
Shechemites,Gen. 34, 23. which
tooke the ſeale of Gods

couenant vpon them, to
haue the ſubſtance and
cattell of the children of
Iacob: nor the Iewes,
which in the 6. of Saint
Iohn, follow Chriſt to
haue bread; he will not
make Ieſus Chriſt ſerue
him for a puruey or, nor
religion to be a merchā
                  dize
of the time, or a dependancie
of his domeſticall
affaires. The feare
of men, ſhame, reſpect,
worldly honours, couetouſneſſe,
like blind and
traiterous coūſellers, ſhal
not be admitted vnto
this counſell: but he will
withdraw himſelfe vnto

God; & after hauing ardently
craued his grace,
he wil reſolue to beleeue
nothing but what hee
teacheth vs in his word:
wherein if there be any
difficulty, yet that which
remaineth cleare, is ſufficient
for our inſtructiō.
Adde hereunto, that if
he demand faithfully in
Ieſus Chriſt his name,
the grace to vnderſtand
inough for his ſaluation,
Ieſus Chriſt promiſeth
that all which we ſhall
ſo demand in his name,
he will giue vs.
               Likewiſe if he be to
make a match, or chuſe

any vocation, he wil firſt
counſell himſelfe with
God, that he may chuſe
that vocation in which
he ſhal be leaſt ſollicited
to offend God, and in
which he ſhal haue moſt
meanes to glorifie him.
After this conſultation,
humane wiſedome may
be heard in her rank, not
as a miſtris to rule the
roſt, but as a ſeruant,
who ſpeaketh when he
is queſtioned: ſhe ſhall
propound what our forces
are, what the preſent
neceſſitie is, what the
courſes of the time, and
the circumſtāces of places

and perſons. In like
ſort, if there be any queſtion
of mariage, the
faithfull wil before all other
things conſult with
Gods mouth, and will
heare the Apoſtle Saint
Paul (1. Corin. 7.) commanding
that it be done
in the Lord. And God
himſelf in the 7. of Deuteronomie,
charging vs
not to contract mariage
but with true beleeuers.
So Iſaac and Iacob were
maried by the commandement
of their fathers;
but Eſau took vnto him
wiues of the Gentiles,Gen. 26. 35.
which were a bitterneſſe

vnto Iſaac and Rebecca.
I paſſe ouer the conſideration
of the inconueniences
which doe ſpring
thereof, for at this time
we do ſeeke onely after
the proofes and effects
of the true loue of God.
For if a friend ſhould
marrie himſelfe without
cōmunicating the matter
vnto his friēd; might
he not take occaſion to
ſay, You doe miſtruſt
me, and do all your buſineſſe
without ſpeaking
thereof vnto me. Now
if God hath cōmunicated
vnto vs all his coūſel,
as ſaith S. Paul, Acts 20:

ſhall we make difficultie
to let him know ours?
His counſell (I ſay)
which is a bottomleſſe
depth of wiſedome, full
of wholeſome and holy
myſteries: on the contrarie,
our coūſels which
are but light things, and
wherein he will be our
counſeller for our good,
and which he knoweth
without our communicating
them. Certainly
the word of God is our
good counſeller, who
counſelleth vs without
flatterie, who ruleth vs
without ambiguitie: and
the Prophet Eſay, cha. 9.

calleth Ieſus Chriſt the
Counſeller, not onely becauſe
hee hath manifeſted
to vs the counſel of
God in the Goſpell, but
becauſe he is to counſell
vs in our doubts, and reſolue
vs in our deliberations.
               That which I ſay of
our difficulties, ought
alſo to be vnderſtood of
our ſorrowes; in which
wee ought to addreſſe
our ſelues to God, make
our complaint to him,
powre out our teares &
diſcouer our afflictions
vnto him with a ſon like
libertie: and though he

know them well without
this cōmunicating,
yet will he thereby giue
vs eaſe and contenting.
Take example hereof in
the Pſalmes of Dauid,
where you haue an anatomie
of the thoughts
of the faithfull, and the
picture of a diuers agitation
within him. You
ſhall ſee many Pſalmes,
as the 6. the 22. the 51.
&c. wherein the beginnings
are full of feare, &
the entry ful of anguiſh,
and as it were within
two fingers of deſpaire;
but in the end you ſee
nothing but ioy and aſſurance:

ſo that you
would thinke that the
Pſalme were compoſed
by two men of contrary
humors. From whence
commeth this ſo ſudden
change? was it, that in
the midſt of his prayer,
ſome good newes arriued,
which might allay
his griefe? no ſuch matter:
but thus, that according
as hee grew more
and more feruent with
God, his ſoule riſing
from vnder her burthē,
ſtayed her ſelfe vpon his
promiſes, & came forth
with peace & aſſurance.
Who is that faithfull

Chriſtiā, who hath practiſed
this exerciſe, and
hath not felt eaſe? And if
an obſtinate penſiuenes,
which holdeth the hand
ſtill on the wound, ſeize
on our ſpirits and conſume
them, ought it not
to be imputed vnto the
want of cōmunicating
with God? for teares ſuppreſſed
procure double
ſmart; and although but
vnprofitably ſpent, yet
do they diſcharge vs of
griefe, and giue aire vnto
the wound. But being
ſpent before God,
who hath bound himſelfe
by promiſe, yea

euen by oath, not to abandon
vs, doth bring
vs a great conſolation,
before God (I ſay) who
doth regiſter our requeſts,
yea euen preuenteth
them, ſo farre forth
as Dauid ſaith in the 32.
Pſalme, that God hath
pardoned him his ſinne,
not only after his praier,
but euen as ſoone as he
had any will to craue it.
               For he requireth not any
praiers of vs, becauſe
he hath need of our ſeruice,
but becauſe wee
haue need of his grace:
and that according to
his iuſtice it cannot be

giuen to thoſe which
ſhall not daigne to craue
it. As the Sunne draweth
vp vapours from the
earth, not for it ſelfe, but
to render them to the
earth in raine to moiſten
and fatten it: ſo God the
true Sun of our ſoules,
draweth frō vs our ſighs
and prayers, not for his
own profit, but to make
them raine downe again
vpon vs in ſo many bleſſings.
This ſame frequēt
communication with
God in our afflictions,
will teach vs to turne away
our eyes from men
which do afflict vs, towards

God who doth
employ them, that we
may not be like the angrie
dog, which biteth
the ſtone which is caſt
at him. The man that
ſhall loue, will ſay as Dauid
when Shimei curſed
him:2. Sam. 16. 
                  Suffer him to curſe,
for the Lord hath bidden
him. The Lord proueth
me, or correcteth me;
my ſinnes fortifie mine
enemies, and make them
neceſſarie: the ſtroakes
of God are more wholſome
then the flatteries
of the world. In our domeſticke
harmes let vs
take heed of reſembling

ſuch hurt men, as falling
into frenſie, do teare
all things prepared to
dreſſe them withal. Yea
euen out of affliction,
and in full proſperitie,
what ſweetneſſe & pleaſure
is there in this communication?
For according
to the commandement
of our Sauiour,
Math. 6. the faithful ſhal
enter into his cloſet, and
hauing ſhut his doore, ſhal
pray vnto his Father, who
ſeeth him in ſecret, and
who will reward him openly.
There being couered
from the eyes of
men, he ſhall diſcouer

himſelfe before God
with leſſe diſtraction, &
more familiarity. There,
after hauing ſpoken to
himſelfe, he will frame
his owne inditement, &
condemne himſelfe that
God may pardon him.
And taking the law as a
looking-glaſſe, he will
acknowledge therin the
ſpots of his ſoule, will
ſeeke to couer them by
faith, & to correct them
by repentance. There
he wil meditate vpō the
works of God throughout
the world, his iudgements
againſt his enemies,
his benefites towards

his Church; and
particularly vnto himſelfe,
how God hath
guided him, inſtructed
him, and brought him
vnto his knowledge.
How many monarks &
peoples haue ſet themſelues
againſt the church
being weake and contemptible
in appearāce,
and haue cruſhed themſelues
thereagainſt: but
the church of God ſubſiſteth,
and ſo ſhall do
vnto the end. Yea euen
vſing a ladder as it were
in his meditation, he
ſhal raiſe himſelfe to the
contemplation of the

workes of our redemption,
marking therein
how God would haue
the remedies proportionable
vnto the euil. For,
becauſe man deſiring to
make himſelfe like vnto
God, by exalting himſelfe,
is fallen into death:
God hauing made himſelf
like vnto mā, by abaſing
himſelf, hath reſtored
him vnto life. And
as the woman brought
vnto man the fruite of
death: ſo God would
that woman, to wit, the
holy Virgine, ſhould
bring man the fruite of
life. And as out of the

profound ſleepe of the
firſt Adam, God drew
him forth a womā, who
was bone of his bone,
and fleſh of his fleſh: ſo
by the death of the ſecond
Adam (which the
Scripture calleth a ſleep)
God hath gotten him a
Spouſe, that is to ſay, his
Church, which is one
bodie with him. In this
ſame meditation he wil
admire, how in one perſon,
God hath vnited
himſelfe vnto man, hauing
ioyned the author
of life with a mortall bodie,
ſhutting vp all his
celeſtiall treaſures in a

veſſell of earth, to the
end wee might there
draw of his fulneſſe.
How by the infirmity of
this fleſh, he vanquiſhed
the force of Satan; from
his extreme ſhame hath
drawn exceeding glory;
from the death of that
man, drawne the life of
all mē, by that very ſame
vertue, through which
in the beginning of the
world hee had drawne
light out of darkneſſe.
               In this contemplatiō,
as being enflamed with
this diuine loue, he will
raiſe vp himſelf through
faith, euē vnto the ioyes

of heauen; where God
diſcouers himſelfe face
to face; where the harps
of Saints ſound forth;
& where the Seraphins
aſſiſting before the
throne, crie, Holy, holy,
holy is the Lord of
hoaſts. O how ſweete a
thing is it to ioyne vnto
theſe their praiſes, and
haue a part in this celeſtiall
harmonie! One
onely beame of this glorie
in the transfiguratiō
of Ieſus Chriſt on the
mountaine, had taken away
from S. Peter the remembrāce
of his home,
and of his wife and family:

It were good (ſaid
he) that we ſtayed here;
and would haue ſet vp
tents there. How much
more wold he haue bin
rauiſhed, if himſelfe had
bene transfigured: as the
Apoſtle ſaith,Phil. 3. 21. that Ieſus
Christ ſhall transforme
our vile bodies, that they
may be made like vnto his
glorious bodie. Who
doubteth, but that when
this glorie vaniſhed, S.
Peter was ſeized with
great ſorrow: and ſo indeede
the heart of the
faithfull comming from
this meditation againe
to conſider theſe baſe

and earthly things, is neceſſarily
touched with a
great diſtaſt and baſe eſteeme
of them, and is
grieued to ſee himſelfe
tied thereunto, and to
ſay with Dauid, Pſal. 42.
O when ſhall I preſent my
ſelf before the face of God?
It was theſe thoughts
which made the Prophet
greedie and thirſtie
after the Lord. Theſe
were the thoughts which
made Paul deſire to be
diſlodged, and to be with
Chriſt: which made him
thinke that which was
gaine vnto others, to be
loſſe vnto him. Theſe

are the thoughts which
haue euen in our time
ſuſtained the Martyrs,
which haue made them
go vnto death as cheerfully
as thoſe which
come thence. For loue
is ſtrong (ſaith Salomon)
as death, yea ſtronger,
ſeeing it maketh one to
deſpiſe life.
               This ardour of loue
is entertayned in our
ſoules by a frequent cō
                  munication
with God:
and wee may eaſily ſee,
that the cauſe of our
ſlackneſſe and coldneſſe
in this loue, is, becauſe
wee ſpeake not often

with God. The moſt exquiſite
friendſhips doe
waxe cold for want of
communication: how
much more if friendſhip
neuer hath bene, as
indeed man is naturally
borne and inclined vnto
enmitie with God. This
is a common euill, to
wit, that wee are much
exerciſed in ſpeaking
with others, but very litle
with our ſelues, and
yet leſſe with God. If
ſome houres of leiſure
do ſteale vs from men,
they giue vs not any
whit the more vnto
God. If we enter alone

into our cloſet, we enter
not euer the ſooner into
our ſelues, to examine
our conſciēces, to ſearch
our wounds, to feele the
pulſes of our conſciences,
or to talk with God.
And yet none ſhall ſee
him aboue, who hath
not carefully ſought
him here below; and
hath not carefully walked
with him by prayers,
meditations, and by
the ſtudie and reading
of the word. This let vs
ſtudy, and from our life,
which is deuided into a
thouſand parts, amongſt
a thouſand occupatiōs,

ſuites, ſolicitations, publicke
and domeſticke affaires;
let vs withdraw
ſome houres to giue our
ſelues vnto God, retiring
our ſelues out of
the throng and noiſe of
this world, quietly to
meditate on thoſe
things which pertaine
to our ſaluation. As if by
a litle channell we wold
diuert a part of the troubled
waters of a ſtream,
that they may run more
gently and cleerly. A
running brooke preſenteth
not any images; nor
a ſpirit which is euer in
action, & alwaies puſſed

with buſineſſe, hardly
can hee frame himſelfe
vnto the image of God.
We muſt then ſeparate
ſome houres to ſpeake
with God. All the time
of our life is loſt except
that which is thus huſbanded.
That time alone
is only ours which
we giue to God.
               Let none here alledge
his domeſticke affaires.
For if we be Gods children,
his ſeruice is part
of our domeſticall affaires:
yea, and whileſt
we are doing our handy
workes, what hindereth
vs that we may not think

of God, and ſend him
vp by our broken ſighes,
thoſe ſort of prayers
which the ancient Fathers
called eiaculatoriae?
ſhort praiers which may
be ſaid euery where,
prayers lanced forth, ſpiritual
ſallies borne of the
preſent occaſion; prayers
which haue no other
ornament but feruency,
whoſe clauſes haue no
other contexture but
neceſſitie. Who doubteth,
but that the Prophet
Eliſeus ploughing
of his field, of that verie
labour of his tooke occaſion
to ſay, We ſow

here in teares, but we
ſhall reape in heauen
with ioy? Or that the Apoſtle
S. Paul, labouring
with his hands to make
tents, of this earthly trauell,
tooke occaſion to
thinke of our heauenly
reſt? The way is euery
where open vnto praier:
and the loue of God is
ingenious to ſuggeſt
thoughts, which like
ſparkes of pietie mount
vp vnto God.
            
            
               The fift marke of the
Loue of God.
               THe life of the bodie
is diſcerned by theſeZeale of the glorie of God.
                  
two markes: 1. by motion:
2. by feeling. The
loue of God being the
life of our ſoules, is alſo
knowne by theſe two
things. The foure marks
of this loue which wee
haue hitherto preſented,
are the motions of
our ſoules; for they are
holy actions, and ſpirituall
motions, produced
by the loue of God: but
this fift marke is the feeling,
to wit, an affection
which maketh a man ſenſible,
to be moued either
with griefe or with ioy, according
as God is blaſphemed
or glorified. Carnall

and vicious loue may
ſerue vs for an example.
We reade of the ſonne
of king Antigonus, that
being grieuouſly ſicke,
and none knowing the
cauſe of his maladie: his
Phyſitian perceiued the
cauſe to be the loue of
his mother in law, becauſe
that ſhe being entred
into the chamber,
his pulſe began to beate
extraordinarily. The like
happeneth in the loue
of God. All men that
are therewith poſſeſſed,
when that they ſee God
glorified, or his name
& his truth blaſphemed,

although hee intend to
containe himſelfe, yet
will the pulſe of his conſcience
be extraordinarily
moued, either with
ioy, or ſorow and impatience.
It will chance
him as it happened
vnto Croeſus his ſonne,
who hauing bene euer
dumbe, came ſuddenly
to his ſpeech, ſeeing his
father aſſailed, feare and
griefe hauing ouercome
all naturall hinderances.
For the Spirit of Ieſus
Chriſt dwelling in him,
produceth the ſame effects
in him as in himſelfe;Ioh. 2. 17.
of whom it is written,

                  The zeale of thy houſe
hath eaten me vp.
                  Rom. 15. 3. This
affection did exulcerate
the Apoſtle Saint Paul
being at Athens,Act. 17. 26. and
grieued his ſoule to ſee
the Towne ſo giuen to
idolatry. This ſame zeale
was it which ſeized on
the ſoule of Eli his
daughter in law; ſo as in
her death ſhe was not ſo
much afflicted either
for his or for her huſbands,
as for the Arke
of the couenant which
was taken by the infidels.
It is of this alone
that ſhe ſpeaketh dying:Sam. 4. 21.
                  The glorie of the Lord
                  
(ſaith ſhe) is departed frō
Iſrael. There is no more
certain effect of the loue
of God then this here:
for if at one time we receiue
ſeuerall newes; the
one of the loſſe of a lawſuite;
the other of the reuolt
of ſome perſons
bought; and are more
grieued with the laſt
then the firſt. Or if we
be more angrie to heare
Gods name blaſphemed
then to heare our ſelues
euill ſpoken of; then
haue we in vs an aſſured
witneſſe, that the loue
of God is liuely imprinted
in our ſoules. Good

bloud will not bely it
ſelfe. All wel-borne children
are touched at the
quicke with the iniuries
are done vnto their fathers:
who ſo is not moued
therewith, confeſſeth
himſelfe a baſtard
or a ſtranger. This is an
euill which we ſee before
our eyes, to our
great griefe: that vnto
them which make profeſſion
to carrie weapons,
and to vnderſtand
the termes of reputatiō,
if one ſpeake the leaſt
croſſe word, it is inough
to cut one anothers
throate: ſo that they

confeſſe their liues to be
litle worth, ſeeing they
will hazard them for ſo
litle, making it an euerie
dayes exerciſe: but if
God be blaſphemed, &
his truth ſlandered, if his
name be abuſed before
their eyes, they remaine
vnmoueable, and beare
a part therein. We are
leapers, without feeling
in ſpirituall things, but
verie ſenſible in carnall.
We go for curioſitie vnto
ſermons, where Gods
truth is oppoſed againſt,
and our preſence by the
weake taken for an approbation:
but we wold

be loth to be found i
                     •
                  
a place or companie
where the honor of our
houſe ſhould be defamed,
but to contradict
the ſame. Let vs vndergo
in this point a voluntary
condemnatiō, and let vs
acknowledge that this
ſpirituall feeling is verie
feeble in vs, to the end
we may craue of God
to awaken it, by quickening
vs with his loue.
               From theſe fiue degrees
and fiue markes,
you may eaſily gather,
that the loue of God
conſiſteth not onely in
hauing a good opinion

of him, or to haue a
good feeling, or to ſpeak
well of him; but that
chiefly it conſiſteth in
obeying him, and conforming
vs to his wil. So
God in his law ſaith, that
he ſheweth mercie vnto
them which loue him;
but he addeth, & which
keep my commandements.
And Ieſus Chriſt, Ioh.
14. Who ſo loueth me, will
keep my ſayings. And the
ſame Apoſtle in another
place:1. Ioh. 3. 
                  My litle children,
loue not in word, neither
in tongue onely, but in
deed and in truth. So S.
Iames ſaith:Cha. 1. v. 17 
                  That pure

and vnderfield religion before
God, is to viſit the fatherleſſe
and widows in
their aduerſitie, and to
keepe our ſelues vnſpotted
of the world. But there be
many that are religious
in ſpeech, not in actions;
and who ſtudie to be
more skilfull, not more
wiſe; who confeſſe God
with their lips, but denie
him in their hearts. Like
vnto thoſe which ſtruck
Ieſus Chriſt, ſaying,
Haile maiſter: or to Rabſhakeh,
who ſpake not
the language of the people
of God, but for to
diſhonour him withall.

He knoweth not God,
who loueth him not; &
he loueth him not, who
obeieth not his wil. The
children of Eli were inſtructed
in the will of
God; for being Prieſts
they taught it vnto others;
and yet the Scripture
ſaith, 1 Sam. 2. 12.
that they knew not God,
becauſe they loued him
not.
                  1. Cor. 4. 20. 
                  The kingdome of God
(ſaith S. Paul) lieth not
in words, but in power. It
is euen ſo with his loue.
So Dauid in the 33. Pſal.
ſaith, that praiſes are very
comely; but he addeth,
in the mouths of iuſt men.
                  
As for the wicked, God
ſaith vnto him in the 50
Pſalme, Wherefore takeſt
thou my words into thy
mouth? For this cauſe
was it that Ieſus Chriſt,
when the diuell confeſſed
him, ſaid vnto him,
Hold thy peace, hold thy
peace. For the praiſe of
God, and the truth of
religion, are vilified and
debaſed in the mouth
of the wicked, and therby
loſe their authoritie:
for ſhee is made a
companion of vice; and
the liuerie of Gods children
becometh by this
meanes a cloake of impietie.

Thou ſaiſt, I loue
God, but doeſt deſpiſe
his will: I loue God, but
doeſt hate the image of
God. Canſt thou loue
God without following
him? or follow ſuch as
do good to their enemies,
whileſt thou liueſt
in diſcord with thy brethren?
We proteſt all of
vs to loue God, but we
better loue the increaſe
of our monies then the
aduancement of his
cauſe. Wee proteſt to
feare him, but we do
not feare to do before
him ſuch things as we
would ſhame to do before

men. Who is that
quarreller or theefe, that
wil ſtrike or ſteale in the
preſence of the Iudge?
and for all this, what do
we not in Gods ſight,
the Iudge not onely of
our actions, but alſo of
our thoughts? We proteſt
to loue Ieſus Chriſt,
and yet abandon his
members which are the
poore. We ſpend more
in a quarter of an houre
at play, then in a whole
yeare in almes. The ſuperfluitie
of our attire,
would cloathe a great
number of poore. All is
ſpent in pleaſure, and

nothing in pietie. All is
for our couetouſnes, &
nothing for Gods ſake.
Doth that man loue
God, which wil not willingly
ſpeake vnto him,
nor of him; or who taketh
no counſell of God
in his diſtreſſe? or who
is not touched with the
zeale of his glory? In the
mean time there is none
amongſt vs, who maketh
not profeſſion to loue
God: which ſheweth
that wee loue him in
groſſe, but hate him in
retaile; this being in generall,
and gainſaid in
particular. We ſpeake of

heauen, but haue our
hearts on the earth. By
this meanes if one mark
apart our loue to God,
it may be found ſome
ſpeciall matter; but if we
ballance it with our loue
of the world, our pleaſures,
our riches, our
preferments, it is found
verie light: ſo that our
loue is a kinde of diſeſteeme,
and almoſt an
hatred. Let vs take heed
to our ſelues; for we ſhal
not be iudged according
to this general profeſſion,
but according
to our particular actions.
And if ſo it be, that

we loue not God as we
ought, or if wee loue
ſome other thing with
him otherwiſe then for
his ſake, how ſhall we
ſubſiſt before him, louing
any thing better
better then he? yea euen
againſt him, louing that
which God hateth, to
wit, the world and the
deſires thereof, and cheriſhing
his enemies in
his preſence.
            
         
         
            
            CHAP. IV. Fiue meanes or helpes to
inflame vs in the
loue of God.
            NOw we are to treat
of the meanes to
nouriſh in vs this loue.
It is ſurely an effect of
the Spirit of ſanctification,
which God giueth
onely to his children:
whereupon this ſpirit
is called the ſpirit of adoption
by the Apoſtle,
Rom. 8. becauſe it is not
giuen to any other then
the children of God,
which he hath adopted

in Ieſus Chriſt: and that
therefore hee frameth
their hearts vnto a childlike
loue, and to haue
recourſe vnto God as
their Father. It is requiſite,
that the grace of
God ſhould preuēt our
wils, to make them willing;
that it may accompanie
them, that they
may will feruently; and
that it follow them, to
the end they may not
will in vaine, and without
fruite.Phil. 2. 13. 
               It is God which
bringeth forth in vs with
efficacie, both the will and
the deede, according to his
good pleaſure. Notwithſtanding

God moueth
vs not like ſtones; he maketh
vs follow willingly,
he bendeth our wils
by an vnconſtrained neceſſitie.
For this cauſe is
it, that we are called, workers
together with God:
               1 Cor. 3. 9.
& that in the ſame place
where S. Paul ſaith, that
God giueth the will and
the deede according to his
good pleaſure: he willeth
notwithſtanding that we
ſhould worke out our owne
ſaluation with feare and
trembling. Phil. 2. 12. 13.
            The meanes then
which we haue to employ
our ſelues in the

nouriſhing and cheriſhing
of this loue of God
in vs, is in generall, to
giue our ſelues to good
workes, which be pleaſing
vnto him. But in
this trauell, I finde fiue
helpes, by which, wiſedome
ioyned with pietie,
through a holy induſtrie
do quicken this
loue in vs, and doe put
matches as it were vnto
our hearts, thereby to
kindle this ſpirituall
flame.
            Theſe meanes or aids
are:
            I. The image of vices.
            
               
II. The choice of
friends.
            III. Hatred of the
world.
            IV. Prayer.
            V. The hearing and
reading of the word.
            
               The first helpe or aide of
the Loue of God.
               THoſe who void out
of their lodgings
their ſtable dung,The image of vices. do fatten
their fields withall;
and by ridding themſelues
of this infection,
doe otherwiſe make a
profit thereof. The faithfull
Chriſtian ought to

follow this example. For
it is the dutie of pietie,
to diſcharge our ſelues
of thoſe vices which are
of ill ſauor before God:
but Chriſtian wiſedom
findeth meanes to draw
euē from this filth, ſome
commoditie. He then
which would ſeek ſome
model, whereon to form
the loue of his God,
ought to obſerue amongſt
all the reſt, the
moſt monſtrous and the
moſt obſtinate vices, &
they are ſo all indeede.
Yet I think that extreme
auarice doth ſome deale
beare away the bell. Let

it then be expoſed to open
view; and let this
monſter, which corrupteth
man when it is
within him, teach man
being thruſt forth, and
inſtruct him afarre off.
For will you loue God,
as you ought? loue him
then as a man extremely
couetous loueth his money.
Auarice taketh away
reſt, and troubleth
ſleepe; his money is the
firſt thought at his waking:
ſo let the loue of
God breake our ſleepe,
poſſeſſe our thoughts in
the night; let it be the
firſt of our thoughts at

our awaking, to meditate
on his former graces,
to diſpoſe of our future
life, to bewaile our
ſinnes at the cock-crowing.
Couetouſnes doth
ſhut the heart of the couetous
into his coffer,
where his treaſure is: ſo
alſo let the loue of God
fixe our hearts in heauen,
to the end that
there where our treaſures
be, there may our
hearts be alſo. Auarice
ſnatcheth out of the niggards
hand the bread he
ſhould eate, and maketh
him be content with little:
ſo muſt the loue of

God teach vs abſtinēce,
and how to bring vnder
our bodies; to liue with
litle, and to depriue our
ſelues when it is requiſite,
of temporall commodities
for his ſeruice.
The auaricious man vndertaketh
for gaine long
voyages, ſequeſtring
himſelfe from his wife
and children: ſo muſt
the loue of God prepare
vs to endure baniſhmēt,
to leaue wife and children
to follow God; remembring
the ſaying of
our Lord, Mat. 10. Who
ſo loueth father or mother
more then me, is not worthie

of me: or who ſo loueth
ſonne or daughter
more then me, is not worthie
of me. The couetous
man hauing put his money
vnto vſurie, calculateth
the time, and with
impatience attēdeth the
terme: ſo we that know
that God hath in his
hands our pledge, and
that hee will render vs
our almes with vſurie,
ought with impatience
to attend the time of
payment; and in the
meane time very preciouſly
keepe his obligation,
which is the doctrine
of the Goſpell.

The couetous man, the
older hee waxeth, the
more greedy he is to gather;
he liueth poorely,
that he may die rich; his
purpoſe to gather is at
the greateſt, when the
terme of his life is at the
ſhorteſt: ſo muſt the old
man fearing God, make
more carefull prouiſion
of faith and good works.
Let him liue poore in
worldly goods, that he
may die rich in heauenly.
Old age is the groūds
and lees of life; but in
the faithfull man it reneweth,Pſal. 103.
as vnto an Eagle:
for then he feeleth

more liuely and certainly
the motions of the
life to come; then hath
he the wager almoſt in
his hand, being neere
the end of his courſe.
Whē the riuers are neer
their end, and approach
vnto the ſea; the tide
cometh towards them,
and meeteth them: ſo
when the courſe of a
faithfull mans life commeth
neare his end, then
God cometh to meete
him; and before death,
giueth him ſome taſte
and feeling of the life to
come. Then it is that we
ought to haue a holy couetouſneſſe

to husband
our time, make a ſtocke
of faith, ſend our good
workes before vs, and to
make our ſelues friends
which may receiue vs
into the euerlaſting habitations.
This meditation,
which giueth vice
a double conſtruction,
and maketh it look both
waies, enforceth it to be
an example and helpe
vnto vertue: as Amorrheā
captiues, to cleanſe
& decke the tabernacle;
as a woman of Hethe,
whoſe haire and nailes
are cut off, Deut. 21. For
vertue is ſo feeble in vs,

that to raiſe it ſelfe vp, it
boroweth helpe of vice;
it paſſeth ouer to the Philiſtiās
to whet her tools.1. Sam. 13. 20.
Becauſe we cānot comprehend
how much we
owe vnto God, but
through the conſideration
of that which we
giue vnto our concupiſcence;
for all that is ſtolen
from him,
            
            
               The ſecond helpe vnto the
Loue of God.
               THe ſheepe of Iacob
brought forth ſpotted
lambes,Choiſe of friends. according
to the colour of the rods

were layd before them:
ſo men produce workes
conformable vnto the
obiects which they haue
before their eyes. And
this is a great euill, that
good examples haue
nothing like ſo great
force to forme vs vnto
goodneſſe, as bad haue
to induce vs vnto euill.
For, as a man ſtrucken
with the peſtilence, will
ſooner infect a douzen
ſound men which ſhall
approach to him, then
theſe whole men can
helpe him: in like ſort, a
vicious man will ſooner
infect many honeſt mē,

then he wil correct him
ſelfe by their example.
For vice is here in his
own ſoile, it cometh vp
without plāting, it groweth
without pain; much
more then being fortified
from without, & wel
laboured: but vertue is a
ſtranger, and reſembleth
a graine brought from
the Eaſt, which after
much care and labour,
doth yet little proſper
but degenerate; eſpecially
in the contagion of
theſe times, which is as
the dregges and ſinke of
all ſeaſons and ages, in
which vertue is a prodigie,

and pietie a crime or
ſimplicitie. For thus do
men call fooliſhneſſe in
this age; in which, that
they may rēder or make
vertue to be odious,
they cloath brutiſhneſſe
with his habit. Euen as it
is vneaſie that the flocks
feeding amongſt the
thornie buſhes, ſhould
not leaue ſome of their
wooll: ſo is it hard for
an honeſt man, liuing amongſt
ſo great corruption,
but he muſt leaue
ſome of his innocencie.
We fall away inſenſibly;
we go on in badneſſe,
without being aware

thereof, like people ſleeping
in a boate, and caried
downe the ſtream,
which make much way
without thinking thereon.
Wherefore we are
to looke to our ſelues,
and in ſo contagious an
aire, to prouide our
ſelues of preſeruatiues,
of which, the beſt is the
loue & feare of God. And
this loue is nouriſhed
by hanting thoſe which
loue him. We muſt acquaint
our ſelues with
ſuch as wee ſhould be
like; to the end that the
faithfull with ſome few
friends louing God,

withdrawing himſelfe
as it were from vices,
may looke with horrour
vpon them as from a far
off, vpon this ouerflowing
torrent and powerfull
reigne of the diuell;
comforting himſelfe in
the meane time in God,
and relying on his loue.
               This ſame friendſhip
among the faithfull, will
ſerue the better to make
them know themſelues.
For ſeeing we be blind
in our imperfections, we
ought to borrow our
friends eyes, and lend
them ours, to the end
we may mutually reprehend

and correct one another.
The ſerious reprehenſions
of a friend,
do more good then praiſes,
were they neuer ſo
true. Whoſo ſhall take
away from friendſhip
the libertie of reprehending,
leaueth nothing
that may diſtinguiſh it
from flatterie.
               And ſeeing that we
are naturally lame and
benūmed in things touching
Gods ſeruice, we
muſt employ the helpe
of our friēds, to the end
they may bring vs into
this bath to receiue healing.
For God communicateth

not his graces
vnto vs, that they ſhould
fade and vaniſh with vs,
but that we might multiply
our talent; and that
the ſpring of his ſpiritual
benedictions, which he
cauſeth to breake forth
in vs, may run out, and
ſerue for inſtruction to
our neighbors: as Chriſt
ſaith to S. Peter: But thou
being conuerted, confirme
thy brethren. For if God
command vs to take vp
our enemies ſtrayed
beaſt; how much more
to reforme the ſoule of
our friend, when it wandereth
out of the way

of ſaluation? This communication
alſo among
the faithfull, bringeth
comfort in affliction,
which being deuided among
many, is more eaſily
borne. Many ſmall
brooks reunited in one
channell, carrie great
veſſels: many afflicted
ſpirits ioyning thēſelues
together by concord &
mutuall ſupport, will eaſily
beare an affliction.
And the word of God
witneſſeth vnto vs, that
God looketh on, hearkneth
vnto, and taketh
pleaſure in the conſolations
and mutuall exhortations

of his children.
So the Prophet
Malachie in the 3. chapter
ſaith, that when the
proud are eſteemed happie,
and the bad aduanced,
then thoſe which feared
the Lord, ſpake one
vnto another, & the Lord
was attentiue and heard:
and a booke of remembrance
was written before
him, for them which feare
the Lord, and think on his
name; and they ſhall be
mine (ſaid the Lord)
when I ſhall lay apart my
moſt precious iewels. O
how precious a treaſure
is a vertuous friend fearing

God! And would
to God that as we are vſed
to know by certaine
markes the goodneſſe
and courage of a horſe;
ſo alſo in the choiſe of
friends, that we might
with the ſight of a man
know his vertue: but the
lurking holes of the ſpirit
of a man are ſo deep,
that he deceiueth both
himſelfe and others, and
he is hidden euen from
himſelfe. Yet by a mans
innocencie of his actiōs,
ſobrietie of his words,
by the ſimplicitie of his
habit, by his zeale and
ardour in Gods cauſe,

by his diſeſteem of gain,
by his eſchuing of pleaſures,
you may very probably
know the puritie
of his mind within: euē
as by the ſparks coming
forth of a heape of aſhes,
men know the hidden
fire.
            
            
               The third helpe of the
loue of God.
               THe diſeſteeme likewiſe
and hatred of
the world,Contempt and hatred of the world doth not a litle
aide vnto the loue of
God. For the loue of the
world (ſaith S. Iames) is
enmitie againſt God. And
S. Iohn likewiſe:1. Ioh. 2. 
                  If anie

one loue the world, the loue
of the Father is not in
him. By the world, I vnderſtand
humane buſines,
worldly pomp, carnall
enticements, earthly
deſires, deceitful and vncertaine
hopes: who ſo
loueth God, will looke
on theſe things with diſdaine.
He wil paſſe ouer
all the ages of man, from
his conception vnto his
rotten ſepulcher: he will
conſider in all the conditions
and ſtates of his
life, his certaine miſerie,
his vncertain hopes, vnfruitfull
gaine, that he
may ſay with Salomon,

Vanitie of vanities,
                  Eccleſ. 1. 
                  all is
vanitie. Looking on
theſe things with a diſdaine,
mingled with
compaſſion: a diſdaine
extending euen vnto hatred,
when he ſhall conſider
wickedneſſe to be
mingled with vanitie,
and the diuell to haue ſo
eſtabliſhed his reigne in
the world, that it is a
kind of miracle and prodigie
to ſee therein a
good man. So as the
Prophet Eſay acknowledgeth
chap. 8. Behold
me (ſaith he) and the children
which the Lord hath
giuen me, for a ſigne and

for a miracle in Iſrael.
Now if it were a miracle
in Iſrael to ſee a familie
inſtructed in the
feare of the Lord, how
much more amongſt infidels?
and if in Ieruſalem,
how much more
in Babylon? It is then
without reaſon that we
wonder when wee ſee
examples of diſloyaltie,
crueltie, vncleanneſſe;
ſeeing that on the contrary
the Spirit of God
teacheth vs, to hold the
example of pietie and
the feare of God for a
miraculous and vnuſual
thing. Theſe and ſuch

like conſiderations ioyned
vnto the feeling of
the excellencie of the
children of God, will
cauſe the faithfull to eſteeme
himſelfe better
then the world; and looking
on the earth as a
place curſed, will liue
therin as a paſſenger and
traueller: as an Engliſhman
that ſhould trauell
ouer Perſia or Tartaria,
intending to returne into
his countrey. For hee
will not anſwer as that
Philoſopher, who being
enquired, of what countrey
he was, anſwered,
that he was a citizen of

the world: but the faithfull
ſaith, he is a ſtranger
in this world, and a citizen
of heauen; and therfore
withdrawing his affection
from the world,
and raiſing vp his heart
vnto God, he doth like
him, who from the top
of the Alpes where the
aire is cleer, looketh vpō
the fields beaten with
tempeſt, the country all
about foggie and miſtie;
and there reioyceth him
ſelf, reſting himſelfe vpō
the loue of God, which
hath deliuered him frō
this general male dictiō.
So in the 29. Pſalme, after

hauing repreſented
the tearing of the Cedars,
the ſhaking of the
mountaines, and the diſcouering
of the forreſts
by the force of the thundering
voice of God; he
withdraweth the children
of God out of this
confuſiō, and aſſembles
them into Gods pallace,
where hee is glorified;
and aſſures himſelfe that
God wil giue peace and
ſtrength vnto his people.
For in this pallace
of God, which is his
church, doth ſound that
voice, not which ſhaketh
the mountains, but

which aſſureth our
hearts; not that voice
which rooteth vp the
Cedars, but that which
comforteth our conſciences:
not that which
cauſeth the Hindes to
caſt their yong ones, but
which maketh vs to
conceiue hope. It is the
word of the Goſpell, in
which God layeth open
the treaſures of his loue:
in which whoſoeuer
ſhall take a reliſh, he ſhall
finde the ſweetes of the
world to be bitterneſſe,
and hating the ſame, wil
learne to loue God.
               Now we ſay this, not

to diſcharge our ſelues
of all earthly things: this
careleſnes of the world
hindereth not the loue
of our children, nor the
care of our family, nor
our endeuour in the adminiſtration
of our magiſtracie;
but the faithful
will do theſe things, as a
paſſenger fits himſelfe in
the beſt manner he may
at ſome Inne. He who is
not to ſtay there aboue
a night, will not ſtand to
build a wall; and if he
ſuffer there any diſcommodity,
he wil patiently
digeſt it, becauſe it is but
a paſſage. For the faithfull

wil follow domeſticall
and ciuil affaires, not
as if he meant there to
ſet vp his ſtaffe, to tie
therunto his deſſeignes,
or therein to place his
hope. His thoughts will
euer be in ſome other
place; and during his
buſineſſe, will euer think
of the vanitie of his trauell.
He will alwayes begin
his actions with the
ſeruice of God, and inuocation
of his name;
and that ſhal euer be the
firſt, which he will haue
laſt: whileſt worldlings,
after the example of
Martha, paine themſelues

exceſſiuely in domeſticke
affaires; he after
Maries example, will
chuſe the good part,
which ſhall not be taken
from him, placing himſelfe
at Chriſts feete to
heare his word. If hee
haue any worldly feares,
they wil giue place vnto
the feare of God. If he
haue any hopes, they
will giue place vnto his
hope of the kingdom of
heauen. If he haue any
ſorrowes, they will be
ſwallowed vp of a greater
ſorrow, proceeding
from the ſence of his
ſinnes, or the bruiſings

of Ioſeph. God himſelfe
herein is an example vnto
vs. For in building of
the world, he hath done
cōtrary vnto men which
do build alſo: men begin
at the foundation, but
God beginneth at the
top. He ſtretched out
the heauens, before he
laied the foundations of
the earth. The naturall
workes of God, are ſpirituall
inſtructions vnto
vs. To the end that wee
may follow this order,
and that wee may euer
begin by the care of heauenly
things; the earthly
will preſent themſelues

in the ſecond rank to be
thought on, not of loue
or of purpoſe, but by
neceſſitie, and as much
as is required, for not
ſeeming cruell vnto
thoſe which be ours, or
enemies to our ſelues.
Seeke ye firſt the kingdom
of God, and the righteouſnes
thereof, and all other
things ſhal be adminiſtred
vnto you. Math. 6. 33.
            
            
               The fourth aide of the
loue of God.
               FRequent and often
prayers doe likewiſe
nouriſh this loue;Prayer. I mean

as well publicke as priuate:
for the publick, are
a quire of ſighes, a harmonie
of affections ſent
vp with one accord vnto
God; which imitateth
that holy conſort of the
Angels & ſoules of the
Saints ſounding on their
harps in heauen; wherof
mention is made in the
5. of the Apocalypſe. In
our priuate prayers, the
faithfull man being hidden
from mans eies, diſcouereth
himſelfe vnto
God, maketh his complaints
to him with a
child-like familiaritie,
prayeth vnto him, not

of cuſtome, but with affectiō,
with words broken
off with ſighes,
which are vſed euen in
the midſt of buſineſſe,
through a gentle diſtraction
and wholeſom interruption:
which prayers
haue no other motiue
but loue, nor other
ſubiect but neceſſitie, or
other eloquence but affection.
None craueth
an almes with the flowers
of Rhetoricke. Familiar
ſimplicitie is verie
comely in prayer. To
make theſe ſolitary praiers,Gen. 24. 63.
                  Iſaac went out into
the fields. So king Ezechias
                  
turned his face vnto
the wall,Eſay 38. 2. for feare to
be troubled in his praier.
So the Apoſtle S. Peter
went vp vnto an high
roome of the houſe to
pray alone.Act. 10. 9. Ieſus Chriſt
himſelf in the 6. of Luke,
withdrew himſelfe into
a mountain to make his
prayers, and continued
therein all night. Both
theſe ſorts of prayers
haue promiſe of God to
be heard. As touching
the publick, our Sauiour
promiſeth vs,Matth. 18. v. 19. 20. that there
where two or three be
gathered together in his
name, he will be in the

midſt of them: and that all
which they ſhall aske with
one accord, ſhall be ganted
them. As for the priuate,
he alſo ſpeaketh thus in
the 6. of S. Matth. When
thou prayeſt, enter into
the cloſet, and hauing ſhut
the doore, pray vnto thy
Father which is in ſecret;
and thy Father which is
in ſecret, ſhall reward thee
openlie.
               
               Theſe prayers are ſo
many matches of the
loue of God. For as
ſoone as God will be
prayed vnto by vs, this
is a great witnes vnto vs
that he loues vs. Our

importunitie is pleaſing
vnto him; he giueth by
his commandemēt free
acceſſe vnto our praiers.
That wee may obtaine
his graces, hee demandeth
no other price of
vs but our prayers. For
riuers of his goodneſſe,
he demandeth but ſome
drops of our thankfulnes.
He is attentiue vnto
the crie of the afflicted.
He is nigh vnto them
which call vpon him.
                  Pſal. 45. 18▪
                   If
the crie of dead Abels
bloud came vp vnto
him; how much more
the cry of his liuing childrē,
which cal vpon him

in the name of Ieſus
Chriſt? If he reckon our
haires, how much more
our ſighes and our prayers,
which hee himſelfe
hath preſcribed vs? Adde
hereunto, that prayer is
a ſtrong bridle vnto vs,
to hold vs in the feare of
God. For this onelie
thought, that it is before
him that we preſent our
ſelues, before him who
knoweth our harts, who
ſeeth all our filthineſſe
through the cloake of
hypocriſie; obligeth vs
to purifie our hearts and
our hands, to wit, our
thoughts and actions;

according to the commandement
of the Apoſtle:1. Tim. 2.
                  I will (ſaith he)
that all men make praiers
in all places, heauing vp
pure hands without anger
or debate. On the contrarie,
God (by the Prophet
Eſai) reiecteth hāds
full of bloud,
                  Eſay 1. 
                  euen when
they lengthen out their
praiers.
               
               Then when we come
to frame our prayers,
each word that we ſay,
is a leſſon or a reproach.
For example, we thus
begin the Lords prayer,
Our Father which art in
heauen. In calling him

                  our Father, wee learne
on the one part to be his
obedient children, and
to be perſwaded of his
loue: on the other ſide,
to deſpiſe the world, as
inferiour to our dignitie,
ſeeing wee be the
children of God. This
word alſo of Our, frameth
vs vnto charity towards
our neighbors, &
to procure their good,
not only in our prayers,
but in all our actions.
And theſe words, which
art in heauen, aduertiſe vs
to ſeeke for heauenly
things; and that our
conuerſation ſhould be

as that of heauenly citizens,
and children of the
heauenly King. Then
when the faithful ſhall
come to propoſe his demaunds,
he will chide
himſelfe on this ſort: I
craue of God that his
name may be hallowed,
and yet I profane and
diſhonor it. I deſire that
his kingdome may come,
and be aduanced; and
notwithſtanding I reſiſt
and foreſlow it as much
as lieth in me, vnwilling
that he ſhould reigne in
me; not ſubiecting my
ſelfe vnto the ſcepter of
his kingdome, which is

his word; nor contributing
any thing to his
Church, which is called
in the Goſpell, Gods
kingdome. Item, I pray
his will may be done, and
yet I reſiſt this wil. I beg
my bread, and yet couet
another mans: My dailie
bread, and yet my couetous
care extends it ſelfe
vnto many yeares. So
likewiſe wee craue that
God would forgiue vs as
wee forgiue them which
haue treſpaſſed againſt vs:
and for all that wee are
vnreconcileable, our hatred
is mortall, or to ſay
better, immortall; and

yet feare not that God
ſhould heare vs, pardoning
vs according as we
pardon our neighbours.
So we deſire not to be led
into temptation, and yet
we runne after temptations,
bad companies,
bookes of loue-tales, after
enticements and occaſions
of doing ill. Finally,
we finiſh this praier
with mention of the
kingdome and glorie of
God, by which this
ſame prayer began, that
it might warne vs, that
euē as our praiers, ſo alſo
al our affectiōs ought
to begin and end with

the glorie of God. So
many petitions, ſo many
aduertiſements: for
Ieſus Chriſt moſt artificially,
by teaching vs
how to craue for good,
teacheth vs alſo to do it.
In ordering our praiers,
hee alſo ordereth our actions:
ſo as ſpeaking to
God, we alſo ſpeake to
our ſelues; by praying
vnto God, we learne alſo
to feare him. And
ſurely when you ſhall ſee
vnrulineſſe in a houſehold,
either by diſobedience
of the children, or
by diſſention betweene
man and wife, it is a certen

witneſſe that God
is not there called vpon
as hee ought. For this
only action of lifting vp
of hearts and hands together
vnto God, might
haue ſufficed to reunite
their diuided affections,
and entertaine from day
to day their familie in
the feare of God. For by
ſpeaking often to God,
we learne to loue him,
and louing him to follow
him. Moſes his face
became ſhining for hauing
ſpoken with God:
ſo our ſoules wil becom
enlightned in the knowledge
of God, when we

                     〈12 pages missing〉
                  
               
            
            
               
               and counſell, all the ambition
of ſo great a monarch,
and making him
contribute at vnawares
vnto the accompliſhment
of the propheſies?
That which is the greateſt
of the world, employeth
it ſelfe for the
leaſt of his children, and
ſerueth for the executiō
of his loue.
               The holy Scripture
being full of ſuch examples,
rightly may it be
called the booke of true
loue; ſeeing that therein
God not onely vnfoldeth
his loue, but alſo
bindeth vs to loue him;

and not only exhorteth
vs to this loue, but alſo
produceth it in vs by
this ſame word, accompanying
the preaching
of the ſame with the efficacy
of his holy Spirit.
And to ſay true, I thinke
that the moſt part of vs
haue had experiēce, that
after the hearing of the
word, the ſparks of loue
do kindle in our hearts;
and that hearing God
ſpeake, or ſpeaking of
God, we are inflamed
with his loue. So the
two diſciples being in Emaus,
after Ieſus Chriſt
was vaniſhed, ſaid, Did

not our harts burn within
vs, when he ſpake vnto vs
on the waie, and preached
the Scriptures? And Ieremie
in the 20. chap. deſiring
to reſerue the word
of God in his hart without
vttering it, ſaith, that
he felt it in his heart like
a burning fire. Wherefore
ſo? but becauſe this
word receiued into the
hearts of the auditors,
heateth them with the
like ardour: as alſo the
tongues of fire deſcending
vpon the Apoſtles,
witneſſed that God gaue
them burning tongues,
and a word full of efficacie,

to enflame mens
hearts. Wherefore thoſe
which being caried away
with their buſines,
or withheld by feare, or
perſwaded of their ſufficiencie,
neglect coming
to ſermons, ſhall inſenſibly
feele that this heate
waxeth coole, and that
a caule groweth ouer
their conſciences. This
negligence will grow to
a diſtaſt, this diſtaſt to a
diſdaine, this diſeſteeme
vnto a hardnes of heart
& enmitie againſt God.
Whoſoeuer will entertaine
the loue of God in
his heart, ought dayly to

come & heare his word,
the which he hath choſen
as a wholſom means
to moue our hearts and
to purge our ſpirits: as
Chriſt ſaith to his Apoſtles:Ioh. 15. 3.
                  You are cleane
through the word which I
haue ſpoken vnto you. Being
there, we muſt hearken
to the preaching
with greedineſſe, ſuffer
reprehenſions gently, receiue
exhortations with
ardor. And euē as thoſe,
vpon whom men mean
to make ſome inciſion,
ſuffer themſelues to be
bound and pinioned by
the Chirurgion, leſt the

motion of the patient
ſhould hinder the operation:
ſo muſt we, when
the ſeruants of God are
occupied about pricking
the apoſtumes of
our vices, and cutting
off our concupiſcences,
which S. Paul calleth our
members;
                  Coloſſ. 3. 5. ſtay our mouing,
lightneſſe and inconſtancie,
leſt it hinder
the efficacy of this word
by our impatiencie.
               To the hearing of the
word, we muſt adde the
reading, according to
the example of thoſe of
Beroea;Act. 17. 11. who after they
had heard S. Pauls preaching,

went and conſulted
with the Scriptures,
to ſee the conformitie
therof with the writings
of the Prophets; although
that the Apoſtle
being powerfull in miracles
and in words, did
preach with authoritie
enough to be beleeued,
as might be thought:
how much more ought
we now a dayes, at our
coming frō the ſermon,
content our curioſity, to
know if that we heare
that day, be true? Wee
which heare Paſtors
which are not receiueable,
but ſo farre forth as

they proue their ſayings
by the word of God? Amongſt
all the books of
holy Scripture, the moſt
obſcure is the Apocalypſe,
and yet it is ſaid
in the firſt chapter, that
happie are they that reade,
and thoſe which heare the
words of this propheſie. In
the 17. of Deuter. God
commandeth Kings to
reade the booke of the
law, all the dayes of their
life. Reading thereof
was the exerciſe of the
Queene Candaces Eunuch,
as he rode in his
chariot. If he read being
a pagā, how much more

being become a Chriſtian?
And if he read when
he vnderſtood not, how
much more when he began
to vnderſtand? If he
read in his chariot, how
much more in his houſe?
Alſo God hath tendered
him his hand by the
miniſtery of Philip; and
vpon the reading, the
light of the Goſpell is
come vnto him, for an
argument vnto vs of
hope, that in reading
carefully the holy Scriptures,
God wil enlighten
vs. He which accuſeth it
of obſcuritie, accuſeth it
alſo of leaſing: for it ſaith

of it ſelfe,Pſal. 19. v. 9 & 10. that it enlightneth
the eyes; that it giueth
wiſedome to the
poore and ſimple; that it
is a lanterne to our feet,Pſal. 119. v. 103.
& a light vnto our paths.
If it be obſcure,1. Cor. 3. 
                  it is (ſaith
the Apoſtle) to thoſe, of
whō the god of this world
hath blinded the vnderſtandings.
At leaſt let vs
haue good opinion of
God our Father. Let vs
not thinke that he hath
written his Teſtament in
obſcure termes and ambiguous
clauſes, to intangle
vs in ſuites. The
Father of lights in neuer
cauſe of obſcuritie. Let

vs not endeuor to make
this word ſuſpitious vnto
the people, as if the
reading thereof were
dangerous; as doe thoſe
profanely fearful people
who vnder euerie ſtone
imagine a Scorpion to
lurke. If there be any difficulties,
the reſt which
is cleare is ſufficient vnto
ſaluation. If it appertaine
but vnto the learned
to reade the Scriptures,
it appertaineth
then vnto none to reade
them, for no bodie is
skilfull before he haue
read them. Wee reade
not the word of God

becauſe we are learned,
but to become ſo.
               Now here we paſſe
ouer an infinite number
of profits which we gather
of this reading; as is
the confirmation of our
faith, conſolation in affliction,
a gentle diuerting;
a maiſter which
flattereth not, a cōpanie
which is not troubleſome,
a ſpirituall munition
houſe, which containeth
all ſorts of weapons
againſt temptations,
which furniſheth
wherewithall to reſiſt againſt
error, following
the exāple of our Lord,

euer reſiſting the diuell
by Scripture, and ſaying
vnto him,Mat. 4. 
                  It is written, it
is written,
                  Luk. 4. 
                  &c. Onely we
will ſtay our ſelues vpon
this, to wit, that the reading
kindleth in our
hearts the loue of God.
This is knowne by experience.
For after a man
once begins to take a taſt
in reading the holy Scriptures,
other ſtudies begin
to proue without reliſh:
you ſhall ſee no
more vpon the Carpet,
bookes of loue; the ridiculous
Romanes and
tales of Amadis do flie
before the Bible more

then the diuell before
holywater: all theſe pleaſing
and vaine readings
which buſied the ſpirit
and tickled the imagination,
do leeſe their taſte
after this ſpirituall nouriſhment.
Another kind
of loue is kindled in the
ſpirits of thoſe which
dayly propoſe vnto thē
                  ſelues
the witneſſes of
the loue of God towards
vs, contained in
his word.
               This meditation furniſheth
vs with a iuſt
ſubiect of complaint.
For then whē they burned
vs for reading the

Scripture, wee burned
with zeale to be reading
them. Now with our libertie
is bread alſo our
negligence & diſeſteem
thereof. We are barbarous,
and new to ſeeke
in the language of Gods
Spirit. Our hearts then
reſemble flint-ſtones,
which caſt no ſparks but
when they are ſtrucken.
Many will haue a Bible
well bound & gilt, lying
vpon a cupboord, more
for ſhew then for inſtruction:
we loue but the
outſide thereof. Wee adorne
the holy Scriptures
outwardly, but it

were better it might
decke vs within. It were
better it were torn with
often reading, that thy
conſcience might be
more entire: for it is
more eaſie for thee to
haue another, then it is
eaſie for thee to be an
honeſt man without it.
Wee deſire a faire impreſſion;
but the faireſt
impreſſion is that which
is made with the finger
of God in our ſoules.
The matrices of theſe
characters are in heauen.
This loue of God
is ingrauen in our hearts
with his hand, and is

formed vpon the model
of that loue which hee
hath borne vs in his Son:
according as he ſaith in
the 15. of Saint Iohn: As
my Father loued me, ſo
haue I loued you:
remaine in
my loue.
               
            
         
         FINIS.
