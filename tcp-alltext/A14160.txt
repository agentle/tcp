                  ¶ To the worshipfull and true Gentleman Maister Iohn Lucas, Eternitie.
                  
                     
                        DEigne (gentle Sir) to cast a willing eie
                     Vpon the issue of an idle braine:
                     Once (though an Eagle) stoupe vnto a Flie,
                     Then scorn such preis, & soare aloft againe.
                     Great oddes betweene the Mowse and Lion be,
                     And yet the Mowse as much a beast as he.
                  
                  
                     
                        Hope lifts me vp vpon her snowie wings,
                     Chearing my thoughts with fortunate euent:
                     
                        Feare pulles me downe, and whispers out such things,
                     As curb my ioyes, and make me mal-content:
                     Saying, the bird that seemes a Swanne by night,
                     Will prooue a wild-goose set against the light.
                  
                  
                     Naithlesse, prickt on with foolish hardiment,
                     I put into those gratious handes of thine
                     These looser numbers: fitter to be rent,
                     Or swept away, like deft Arachnes twine,
                     Than to be read: yet (deerest) list a while
                     Vnto thy Tyros Democriticke stile.

In this veyne I composed these Epigrammes, which I request may be taken in good gree, and read when thou art lazie. Blame me not too bitterly, for mispending a little time: and consider that learned Poets haue, for recreation, wrought vpon worse subiects. I say nothing of Misacmos, who descended from Ela to the Base Keys that open the Priuie doore. Wel: be as good to vs as you may, and farewell.

                     O grosse! O monstrous! fie, Tom Tiro, fie:
                     Giue thy king Edwards shilling for a pie,
                     And then transport it to thy den alone,
                     And chop it vp, and giue thy fellowes none?
                     What? spoile a Neats-foote, and a marrow-bon,
                     And neuer call thy next Vcalegon?
                     Fie that thy greedy-wormed tong is such;
                     Fie that thy chopping kniues can mince so much.
                     Art thou a Milo, or Philoxenus,
                     
                     That art so sturdie and delicious?

                     When capon-like thy maw is cramd so full?
                     Right well I wot thou maist haue lighter hart;
                     If this thou leaue, and learne to size a part.

                     Faire are the sphears wherein the Planets bin,
                     And yet colde Saturne claimes a place therein.

                        Tyro can act and if he like the Stage,

                     Would not the drowsie dormouse haue bin hang'd,
                     That slept till ten a clocke and then was Stang'd?
                     O faults! no faultes, but trickes of gentle kinde,
                     And Proper adiuncts to a youthfull minde.

                     The drunken colour thence away to wipe,
                     Bred with the fumes of the Tabacco pipe.

                     And that same perking Longitude before,
                     Which for a pin-case antique plowmen wore,
                     Nor hath he siluer faces in his purse,
                     On this superfluous trumpry to disburse:
                     Nor hath he skill in Magickes damned spell,
                     To raise some golden diuell out of hell.
                     But who the man that treades on licourd shooe,
                     Or could beleeue, or dreame that this was true?
                     
                        Tyro was wont to leade so staid a life,
                     That sage Sobrietie was thought his wife.
                     The gracelesse gallant with the crisped lockes.
                     Was worse to him than any nine-hold stockes.
                     The painted paper, and the swearing die,
                     Were ghastly Night-crowes to his single eie.
                     The witherd leafe that is in such request
                     He would not ken, but did the name detest.
                     His Slops were spruce, and stucke so neare the skin.
                     That one might hardly part them with a pin.
                     
                        Tyro decayes in good, but thriues in ill:
                     Prowdr as a Beacon on a Forrest hill.

                     He ranne, she followed with a yelling sound,
                     And tucked vp her dirtie sauegard round.
                     But Tyro floated on the beaten way,
                     Like a swift vessell on the yeelding sea:
                     She faire and softly walkt in pausing moode,
                     And tract the felon by the Ganders blood.

                     The new-faln droppes led this olde bloud-hound hie,
                     To an out-chamber, where she did espie &c.
                     The heauie accidents that then befell
                     My merry Muse may not abide to tell.
                     Yet thus much: Tyro stampt, and fret, and swore,
                     Neuer to prey on foolish goose-flesh more.

                        TYro the dastard needs would learne to swim.
                     Yet durst he not come nie the riuers brim.
                     He saw the tempting grauell through the cleere,
                     And yet he trembled like the heartles deere.
                     Pleasure a spur, and Danger was a reyne.
                     That prickt him forward, this did him deteyne.
                     But goodly well anon he can deuise
                     To checke himselfe for shamefull cowardize.

                     Albe thou want renowned Digbies art,

                     Yet mayest thou wade withouten ieopardie.

                        But the milde streame was loath to let him die,
                     And set him on his ten toes by and by.
                     He hid his chilling bare, and home he went,
                     And lay bed-ridden till sixe weekes were spent,

                     BVt ah, what meant I to forbeare this while.
                     To tell of Tyros Steeple-climing stile?
                     Had sweete-lipt Tully slaunting Tyro seene,
                     
                        Cratippus had not his sonnes Tutor beene:
                     Had mightie Philip knowne this wittie elfe,
                     
                        Platos great scholler might haue hang'd himselfe.
                     The greater beare, and the still-standing light
                     He can demonstrate in a winter night.
                     And yet (I blush) three loaues of horses bread
                     Set bolt-vpright, are leuell with his head.
                     Time was when he that did the credite win.
                     Had store of excrement vpon his chin.
                     Now he that looketh with a visage graue,
                     Is hight a blocke, a stocke, a knaue, a slaue.
                     Time was, (and then it was the time of ioyes,)
                     When men were men, and prating lads were boies.

                     That lechers two stood vp in sinfull sheets.
                     When Tyro knew the tydings to be stale,
                     He vp and told this prettie Poets tale.

                        This beastly barne was an Hermaphrodite,
                     
                     And not his fellow-diuelles fauourite.
                     Wherefore the hel-hounds menaced amaine,
                     To prune the worthier member of the twaine.
                     The deede made good the word: without delay
                     They cut it off, and threw it quite away.
                     The needelesse part (forsooth) was presently
                     Transmewd into a fruitfull Almon-tree.

                     He tolde the standers by, he would not rest,
                     Vntill he caught a Swallow (in her nest.)

                  Expectato ad amplissimam dignitatem adolescenti, Iohanni Lucas, Aeternitatem.
                  
                     REgia ales defessa (generosissime adolescens) erecta stat: & caepe augescit, decrescente solis sorore. Ego, tametsi nomine duntaxat faelix, curam expuo. Non sum Vranoscopus vt sine corde viuere possim. En tibi meras nugas, testem huiusce rei locupletem. Maximo te oro opere vt illas dextra manu accipias. Quid nisi vota supersunt? Deus det quae velis.

                     ITané tandem quaeso est, perfide, vt te mei obliuio caeperit! Anno enim Platonico sum suauissimis tuis literis frustratus. Vnum hoc scio me meritum esse vt me in germani fratris loco diligeres. Etenim, dum simul viximus, Heliotropium ego, tu Solmeus extitisti. Tecum circumactus sum, &, quocunqute verteris, eôdem flecti cacumen. Nocte autem, hoc est, absente te, tanuam desiderio tui, florem contraho,
Rore meo, lachrymisque meis ieiunia pascens.
                     
                     Si tibi vel minima erit adulationis suspicio, insignem mihi iniuriam offeres. Iusiurandum do, Gnatonicos, me infra omnes homines infimos putare. Siquid est, in quo in operam requiras meam, fac periculum num idem sit Tyro qui semper fuerim. Delatum est ad me, te paenè esse à Musis auersum. Ita me ament superi, vt nihil iam multis diebus accidit, cui aures meas aegriùs dederim.

                     NO Delphicke oracle is truer than that Maxime, The hardest thinges been of greatest value. Wherefore Aristotle the great, doth easily win credit to his bookes de Anima, by foretelling the difficultie of the intended subiect. Now, of all things vnder the heauens hollownes, nought is attained with lesse facilitie than vertue: which is so inestimable a gemme, that the dainty sandes of Pactolus, the golden bowels of Guiana, nay, the perfect irrelenting Diamond by comparison will become odious. The reason why she is so deerely bought is perspicuous: for that there are millions of wayes to euill, and poore one to goodnes. So then, it must needs be praisably done, to hit the clout in a fielde, the punch in a butte, the centre in a circumference. If the morall Scholler wil sit in Vertues triumphing chariot, he must be a Phoebus, and make his wilde affections treade the right path: lest if Phaëton like he giue them head, they forthwith carry him to the Lion, and Bull: to the Bow, and Scorpion, to one vgly vice or other. It is much to come acquainted with vertue in generall, but especially with that gentlemanly habit beneficence: whose praises no wight can expresse, though hee runne diuision vppon them halfe a yeare together. The very name of her is Doricall Musicke to a good eare: but (alas) not one

Who keepes open house, and open purse: regarding others, and yet not neglecting himselfe, vpholding others, and yet himselfe not vnder. Surely so healthfull a plannet, that blesseth his inferiours with his influence, in spight of Enuie and Tyme shall purchase immortalitie.

If he meete his mistresse, he hales her to the Iuybush, and at first dash cries out, Drawer, fil a quarte of thy most vendible claret. His braine heated, the corruption of one pot is the generation of another. Then coupleth he lippes with his make, and threatens downfall to the chamber. And when his purse is corke-light he thus tryumphs ouer her.

Alacke for pittie that the best wittes and kindest natures are most addicted to this good vice. Well, howsoeuer it be blameable, yet in some part it agreeth with Liberalitie, and by Age and Want may soone be brought to mediocritie. Themistocles was such an vngracious wag, and so franke, that his father disinherited him, and his mother dispairing of his amend, made a long letter of her selfe. Yet in processe of time he was not the man: for he left his by-wayes, and grew to singular account with the weale-publike. Fabius was a wilde youth, yet in his best time a man of good stuffe. This so, no doubt but the kind-hearted gentleman may descend to the mean, which shall in short time be effected: if for a time he striue to bee miserable.

                     A Midaicall slaue, that had his trunks full of bagges, and his bagges full of baggage, kept but one boy, who was his cooke and bedfellow.

So vsed? by Stix I sweare, were I a Iudge, they should all and euerie of them be turnde off roundly, to the great indangering of their neck-bones. Certes Auarice is a capitall plague, a swallowing gulfe, a bottomlesse hell, the greatest euill that the diuell can shuffle into a countrey. Where the Spleene is bigge, the bodie is little, where this mischiefe increaseth, vertue is in a consumption, O what a rotten taile of euils doth this leane beast draw after her. Hence is it that the fatherlesse hath not his hunger quailed, while the mouse and weeuell pamper themselues in the garner. Hence is it that the Clients purse is neuer lesse full than when full. Hence it is that the tenth sheafe is scarse the tenth part of the ninth, or at the least, the least in the companie. Hence it is that one and the selfe same dish, shewes it selfe on one and the selfe same table, til it be either gray-headed, or vide Aristotelem de generatione Animalium. Hence it is that the dunce hides his butter-teeth in bacon, while the approoued scholler pickes marrow out of a Spade-bone. Hence it is that the farmer deales with his daughter, as he does with his hecfar in the market, he that will giue most for her, take her. In summe, hence it is that such a number of money-men ride continually to hell in wheele-barrowes.

Money came in by law, not nature, and was inuented for the easie supplie of mens seuerall necessities.

Aquilius gaping after wealth, had gold powred into his mouth. Pittie but all misers should haue some such Catastrophe.
