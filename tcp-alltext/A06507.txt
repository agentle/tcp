sworne aduersaries wil be readye to say, wher as they and no other are the authors of al mischiefe, as may most manifestlye appeare to any that hath but halfe his right wit) but only as an aduertisment that no mā minister ani aide or obedience to such Tirannes as bend thē selues against God and hys word, and to the subuersiō of their natural coūtrey.

It is he that seduceth kinges and princes. And vsing the crafty conueiaunce of wicked byshopes and priestes, moueth theim to murther and shedding of bloud, which by bringyng Aliens and straūgers sworne vnto hym, into all Realmes▪ meaneth at lēgth to subuert, and abolyshe the auncient lawes, and whole state of noble and godly cōmon welthes, and so to work a general destruction for euer.

Wherefore depart and seperate your selues a waye from them, saith the Lorde.

created, that we should know & praise God, and also witnes and testifie vnto other of hī. And our sauiour Christ himselfe saith, he that denieth me before men, him wil I denie agayne before my heauenly father. And this cō
               fession must be made according to euery mans callyng, state, and degree. Such as be preachers and ministers, must cōfesse him, by preaching of true doctrine. Suche as be rulers and gouernours, must confesse him, by abolishing, and subuertynge of Idolatry and supersticion, and by maintaining of true doctrine and religion. And all that can helpe, by any maner of meanes, either with body or goodes, to ye maintenaunce of the same, oughte to endeuour thē selues earnestly therunto, according to the saieng of S. Iohn i. Iohn. iii. Hereby do we knowe the true loue, that, like as Christ bestowed his lyfe for vs, euen so shoulde we bestowe our liues for the bretherne. Let euerye one consider, and ponder these and suche lyke aduertisementes by them selues, and hauyng alwayes

an eye, and respect vnto the same, let them than reade, and marke this treatise folowyng with diligence.
            And specially for asmuch as al men are not of one mynde, but some take & esteme the true honour of God, the true inuocatiō, religion, and doctrine for the most special and most necessary thyng to be sought, and some not. And agayne some are more feruent & constant in the same than some other. Least thorow the euyl persuasions of ye worst sort, mani other which know not the matter, nor the daunger therof, might be seduced and led amysse, this admonition and aduertisemente therfor, shalbe very necessari and profitable. For let the enemies of God & of our coūtrey pretend what thei wil, that thei meane not to be of councel, nor to subuert our olde auncient lawes: whā thei haue once their purpose, we shal se that that was their speciall drifte.Fayre wordes ar trappes to catch foles

And that a great part of these proceadinges haue not bene wroughte, nor practised without his aduise. What if vertuous and godlye princes, whiche haue set them selues against his kingdom, haue bene betraied and destroied, by the subtile practises of such impes of his, as haue borne swynge by their dissimulation about such vertuous princes. O howe many subtilties hath Sathā, to assaulte Christes kingdome with? I warrāt you it hath cost the b. of Rome mani a nightes watch, yea, many a pound, before these practises were brought to this passe, which are nowe abrewyng. Yet hath god left some holes open, wherby such as haue any vnderstandyng, maye spye theyr driftes. For why do they holde godly, vertuous, learned & most worthy councelours in prison, but onely

because thei feare, least thei wold hinder, and withstande some of theyr enterprises and procedings? Let al those therfore that beare true heartes towardes theyr countrey, suffre them selues to be admonished in time.
            For if the Spanyardes do once enter into our country,What the cōming in of Spanyardes wyl grow to. and maye be suffred to nestle theim selues there, they wil not only at length crepe into the chiefe Dukedomes, Erledomes and lordships, and deale the same among them selues, but also wil establishe the Idol of Rome, and the whole cursed Papaci again: which al our countrey shal repent and rewe for euer.Priestes care not what become of ye Realme, so that theyr hooryshe kingdome floryshe.

and subuert theyr enterprises▪ For whatsoeuer thei can alledge, or pretend, to charge those with, whiche haue imbraced, and setfurth the true religion, as many as haue any indifferent knowledge and vnderstandyng (if they wyll not speake against theyr own conscience) must nedes acknowledge and confesse, that diuers hyghe pointes, and necessary articles of christen religion, haue bene sincerely and purely taught, and declared by them. And diuers notable errours haue by them bene disclosed, which before wer taught, and preached openlye in Pulpets, wherby the people were pitefully seduced. And now such as haue truly and faithfully laboured,The rewarde of true preachers. and traueled, to setfurth the truth to abandon such Idolatry, and supersticion, as the people hath bene extremelye blynded with, to plant true, necessary and holesome doctrine, & to roote out al falshod & hipocrisie, thei are rewarded for their labour with imprisonment, depriuation of theyr liuynges and goodes, & with such like rewards. Other causes

may wel be pretended of the persecutors, and common cutthrotes, as we may heare, but these are the very causes in dede. How long God (which is iust in al his workes) will suffre & vse them as his scourges (as Dauid saith the wicked manne is a scourge of the Lord) that let thē loke vnto. For wher thei pretend, that much disorder, dissension, negligence, securitie, and offence did raigne amōg the professors of the true religion, without redresse or reformation, &c. It cannot be denied, nor they them selues wil not deny but yt al this is true in dede. And more ouer that they are laden with diuers infyrmities and sinnes, as wel priuate and secret, as open and manifest also, and that there haue bene many weedes among them (as euermore haue bene in the true church of God) which haue alwayes waxen, and sprong vp amonge good corne. As with Dauid▪ Nathan & other true mēbers of gods church in those dayes, sprang vp Absalon, Achitophel, and other vnprofitable wedes. But what than? Sholde

the people of God, by reason of suche offences, or bycause of theyr owne or of other mēs infyrmities, vtterli haue denied, and reiected the true doctrine and religion, and yelde to Idolatry & supersticion: as our (yea rather Christes) aduersaries would haue vs now to do? Why do not ye higher powers, the Ioly prelates, and the faut spiers labour to redresse, and refourme suche offences, as they se in any of thē, that haue professed the sincere Religiō? Or why at the least did they not labor to restore the true discipline of ye gospel, that therby such offēce giuers, might haue ben redressed, & brought to an open Christē penaūce, for the welth of theyr own soules, & a good exāple vnto mani other▪ Why did thei not this I say?

The godly preachers haue testified sufficiently in their open exhortations, that such disorder, dissolutenes of lyfe, slaūderous exāples, mispēding of y• time, with vngodli & vnprofitable pastymes, as haue bene vsed of the gentlemen disars, and the lady cardeplaiers (as wel in the Court as in the countrey) wer not agreable to the professiō of Christes gospel. What could thei do more, but openly rebuke such enormities, seing thei wold neuer suffer theim, to exercice the true ordre of discipline, vpon any transgressors? If this discipline (which hath long bene earnestly called for) mighte haue bene optained, a nombre of vnpreachyng prelates, of idle belly byshops, should not haue bene suffred, to loiter as thei

did, and to spēd the patrimony of the Church vnprofitably. But nowe we may se, that thei plaied the dissēbling lurkers, gapyng, workyng and practisyng for a Day, wherin thei myght shew them selues, as thei wer, and as thei now appeare, wher as the ryght order of discipline wold haue brought them to the true profession of sincere Religion, and also to the practise therof, in theyr vocation. And so would it haue done also my Lordes, and gētlemen, scrap
                  •
               alls, which vsed the Gospel for a cloke of theyr couetuousnes. In summa, we lacked nothing but discipline, to haue refourmed al the enormities wt, whatsoeuer they haue bene that our aduersaries haue found fau
                  •
                with, in the profession of our true Religion. But let them lay al the faults, infirmities, and offenses, which they haue marked, & espied in ye professors of the gospel vpon one heape, they al together (if ther wer a thousād mo of them) are farre inferior, and incomparabli lesse, then the manifold errours, impietie, and Idolatry of the Masse,

of the latine seruice, of the inuocation of saintes, of the filthy and abhominable pretensed chastitie, that is of ye Sodomitical single life of priestes, and of such other hipocrisie and supersticion▪ as our aduersaries go about with fire and fagot, with tooth & naile, to maintaine, & to set vp for the seruice of god.
            For notwithstanding that among the membres of the true church, and among the professors of the true religion, ther raigne mani and diuers infyrmities and enormities, which they espie daily in them selues, yet the true godly sort do conceiue true and harty repentaunce, for theyr weakenes, and thei remain nor continue not therin, as the spiritual professors of single life do, in theyr hordome and filthy abhomination. And what soeuer infyrmities thei haue otherwise. Yet this horrible vyce haue they not, (thankes be to God) to maintaine Idolatry, wyttingli to persecute ye truth, nor to murther the godly professours of the gospel. These detestable vices, murther, blasphemy and Idolatry, whiche are

the most true and infallible tokens of the papistes and aduersaries of Christ are not to be found amōg them. For these workes are the speciall workes of the deuyl, whiche he practiseth and worketh in his membres, wherby he declareth and speweth out his poysō malice, and hatred agaynst God,Ihon. viii as it is written, Ye are of the deuil, whiche is a lyar and a murtherer.
            These are synnes, whiche all men oughte specially to 
                  •
               lee, and dayly to pray earnestly vnto God, that he wil preserue them, that thei fal not into any of these abhominations.
            And he that loketh vpon the life of the professors of the Gospel, and also of the papistes, And by reasō of the infirmities, which he seith in both theyr liues, standeth in dout to which of thē he may ioyne himselfe, he ought to remembre and to consider this, that he ought in no wyse to take parte wyth them which are Idolators, maintayners of blasphemies, persecutors, and murtherers of the true membres of Christ. And though they should venter their liues therupon, and goo the

same way that Abell went. Yet haue they this notable comfort, that God heareth their praiers, and wil be merciful vnto them. For all other synnes shal be forgeuē: but the manifest blaspheming of God by idolatry, that is to saye, he that either mainteineth, or helpeth to maintaine idolatry or false religion, & is a persecutor and a murtherer of the true professors, or a fautor of such murtherers, shall neuer be forgeuen. And God knoweth manye of the contrary part, which do refrain from persecuting of the true doctrine, for non other cause, but to thintent to auoide these .ii. pointes (blaspheming of God and murther) for Gods honor, & for theyr own saluations sake. And it is manyfest inough, yt dyuers of thē (thākes be to god) haue sought neither pleasure nor mony, nor dignitie, nor yet any other thyng, that the world estemeth, but rather haue suffered much sorow, misery & opprobrye. Now if such should spend theyr lyues as Abel did, and suffer death thervpō, such a death should be more acceptable

vnto them, then al the lyfe & pleasure of Cain, then all the pompe and riches of the Cardinals and bishops. For al mē are detters vnto death not withstanding. But this must euerye one of vs alwaies consider, howe we may stand (after this lyfe) before the iudgement of God, and of his whole churche, at the latter day euerlastinglye. And as we haue before our eyes the ensamples of Abel, Ieremy, Iohn the Baptist, Christ him selfe, Paule & other of the Apostles, how thei al wer murthered of tyrannes, euē so let thē be sufficient wytnesses vnto vs, that after thys lyfe, another euerlastyng iudgement shal be holden and kepte. And therfore let al men take it for an high honor, and for a singular grace to put theyr liues in ieopardy, for the confession of the true faith & religion of God: as Christ saith: Fear not thē which can do nothing but slea the body, as for the soule thei cānot slea. &c. And for asmuch as it mai wel appear that this is the scope & end of al practises of the Lords & Bishops by theyr

procedings, to bring in the bishop of Rome again, & to establish his idolatry & errors, wherbi they mai raigne, and abuse the people agayne, as they haue done in times past, and to bring our countrey to a perpetuall destruction.Note wel. it is most certaine, that al honest and true hartes, may laufullye refuse to obey them, and ought in any wise refuse to helpe or to ayde them. And where as they wyl obiect, & saye that subiectes ought to obey al cōmaūdementes, & procedynges of theyr magistrates, although it may be briefely answered vnto thē,Byshops ar not magistrates. that the Bishops & Prelates, which are the chiefe workers of this miserye, are not the Magistrates, whom the inferiour people are boūd to obey, yet let thys answer stay al mens consciences, that the regiment of the cōmon welthe,The Magistrate maye not passe hys boundes. is suche an ordinance of God, wherin the magistrate hath his apointed boundes, as wel as the subiect. And for asmuch as God is the hyghest Lorde, if the worldly magistrate attempteth, any thing against him, the inferiour sorte

may laufully refuse to obeye him,Inferiors maye in thys case laufullye disobey. Abdias. iii. re. xviii alledging for thē selues, that thei cānot, nor may not disobey God, to obey & to serue thē. As for an exāple: Abdias did very wel in keping the prophetes priuely in dennes, & secret places, cō
               trary to the cōmaūdemēt of his king which cōmaūded thē all to be slayne. And in like maner the Armeniās dyd wel, & nothing but rightfully, in detē
               ding theyre church & theyr countrey against their Emperour Maximiane. Victorinus was a great prince, which in ye tyme of Gallienus, had ye Emperors autority, in ye gouernmēt at Coley, & did gouerne ther very laudabli, yet was he laufulli slain of his owne secretarie, which foūd him abusing his wife. Marius also a noble prince, did pardō a yong souldier, & set a crowne vpō his head, because he s
                  •
               ew his captain (which captain, notwithstanding was Marius high frende) because he did it in his own defēse. Such factes in Christen mē ar right & lauful, & do please God wel. Yea they are speciall testimonies of ye iudgemēt of God, against

vnlawfull violence, and intolerable pride, and presumpcion of Tyrannes.
            And what is it els but tyrannye, to go about to set vp manifest idolatry, to separate godly mē from their lawful wiues, to bring in straūgers, whiche shal subuert the state of the cōmō welth and such like? For it is easy to perceiue, that if the Spaniardes, and theyr traine, maye once beare rule in the Cities, Dukedomes, & Lordshyps of our countrey (whiche God of hys mercy forbid that euer they shuld do) wher as hetherto, thorow gods mercifull prouidence, the auncient lawes and good ordinaunces of our cōmon welth, haue bene preserued, they wyll go about to abolish & to subuert thē
               ▪ and at length brede much inconuenience and misery in our natiō. Against the which inconueniences all godlye parentes, housholders with theyr wiues, childrē, and families, ought with most harty sighinges cal and cry vnto god, that for the furtherance of his knowledge, and for the glorye of hys owne name, he wyl preserue his true

religion amōg them, and that he will not suffer these churches and naciōs▪ wherin his truth hath bene confessed and preached, to decay nor to be subuerted. And that such praiers may be made the more earnestly, & with out let or hindraūce, we al ought to amēd our liues, in the feare of God, in true faith, and in al other vertues, remembryng the sayeng of the Lorde in the prophet: Turne vnto me,Iere. xiii. and I wyll turne vnto you. Doutles the matter is waighty, and (end how it will) ther is lyke to be a wonderfull alteracion in ye cōmon welth, and also in religiō,We fele i
                     •
                   alredy. that is most sure. And I wōder much, that wise mē, which know and se wel inough, what wil be the end of suche procedynges,Note wel▪
                wyll notwythstanding seme to be workers, and furtherers of suche matters, as they do not allowe in theyr consciences. But surely it is no mans deuise nor working, but it is the diuils in hel, which rage and raue, because they wold gladly woorke an vniuersal destruction and miserye, in al Christēdome. Wherfor it wer best

for such as be in authority, and of any power, not to be hasty in folowing & satisfieng ye lustes of princes, and the practises of wicked bishops and Prelates, Antichristes impes. For seyng the malice and spite of the Diuel; and of the idolatrous sort, is so feruēt and great, it wil minister occasiō to a wō
               derful alteracion; which paraduēture they them selues shall repent. But I besech al godly hartes, that they wyll earnestly pray vnto God, that he wil graciously preserue the cōmonwelth, and auncient lawes of our countrey, and specially hys owne churche, that hys true worde and religion may cō
               tinually sound therin.
            Last of al let al Christen harts bear this wel in rememberaunce, that euery one in his degree, and to the vtterof his power, is bound to apply hys vttermost indeuour, towards the preseruation of Christes true religion, & likewise towards the defence of their coūtrey, and the auncient priuilegies of theyr naciō. That is the special end of our lyfe in this world, and no better

thing can we do in thys lyfe. And forasmuche as the state of oure tym
                  •
                nowe, is muche like vnto the state of the Machabes, and euē the like practises and subtelties now pretended, & attempted, as were than: euerye one mai take good and profitable instructiōs out of the same bokes and story. Our Lorde Iesus, our onelye true shepherd, & head captain, defend hys Church against assaults which ye diuell, Antichrist and his impes nowe deuise, & practise ther against Amen.
         
      
      
         
            
            A faithfull aduertismēt of a certain true Pastor, to his deare countrymen the Germanes, Trāslated into Englyshe for a lyke aduertisement to the Englyshe nation.
            MOst earnest supplication and intercession hath bene made to the high Potentates, both of the Spirituall and of the laye sort, that they woulde not bende them selues so earnestlye, against the true Religion and doctrine of Christ▪ but would shewe them selues more equal and moderate, & suffre the Gospel freely to be preached. And agayne that thei would not consent to bryng straunge princes into our coūtrey, to bear any Rule, or to haue any gouerment therin. The which thing, both I and many other godly heartes, haue most hartely praied, and sighed vnto god for. But forasmuch as nether our most faithfull praiers vnto God, neither yet the earnest intercession made vnto them, could any thyng preuayle with them, it is easye inoughe to perceiue,

what it betokeneth: nameli, euē 
               
                  •
               hys, that beyng peruerse, obstinate, blinded, & geuen ouer of God, as such as haue euer thirsted for innocēt blod, and bent them selues to maintain the blasphemyng of Gods name, and all abhominations, God thinketh them not worthy to be inspired, so much as with one good thoughte, or that they should geue eare to ani faithful aduertisement or profitable intercessiō. And it standeth with them, euen as it stode with ye Iewes in Ieremies time, whā as God sayd vnto Ieremy these wordes, If Moses or Samuel should stād vp, and make intercession for this people, Yet haue I no hearte vnto theim: dryue them from me, and let them depart. &c.Iere. vii▪
                Thou shalt not praye for this people, nor bryng no maner of lamentation, nor supplication before me for theym, Neyther make anye intercession at al for them: For I wyll not heare the. Euen the like answer, may al those which haue made intercessiō, as is before sayd, vnto the potentates and prayed vnto God for them, think

to haue made vnto them. Forasmuch as God sheweth euidente & manifest tokens, yt he wyl not heare any mans praiers for them, but that he wyl suffre them, to go headlynges forwarde, and after the example of Pharao, to sinne agaynst the holy ghost, euen so lōg til there be no more hope of repē
               taunce, nor of ani amēdement in thē. For if ether praiers vnto God for thē or els ani ernest intercession vnto thē would any thynge haue holpen, they would neuer haue gone so far as they haue done. And therfore seing no praier vnto God, nor yet any faithfull intercession vnto them, will take place, let vs no more pray for them, but suffre them (like blinde & obstinate Pharaos) to go forward with their practises, til at length the redde sea ouertake them, and make an ende of them. And as for the praiers,No good praier lost that haue ben made for them, although thei haue done thē no good, yet haue they not beene vnprofitable, vnto those that haue made theim. For they cannot be vnprofitable, that is most certain. But as chris
                  •
               
               
saith, if the salutation and peace of the Apostles, can fynde no place in suche houses, as they are wished vnto, than shal theyr peace retourne agayn vnto them selues: Euen so shal it happē vnto vs. Seyng all our praiers that we haue made for them, haue done them no good: they shal returne agayn vnto vs, & thei for whom they wer made in the steade of praier, shal haue theyr fyl of curses, and in the stead of peace shal haue theyr fil of strife and debate, wherof God send them plenti▪ Amen. And forasmuch as thei are altogether bent to force, and will bryng all theyr procedings to passe perforce, as wel agaīst ye manifest truth of gods word, as agaynst the lauful and auncient priuileges of theyr natural countre, lyke vnnatural men, let no man fear them but be of good cōforte, and take good heartes, against such ragyng enemyes of God. For thei neuer prai nor cal vpon God, nether can thei pray, bi reason of their euil consciences, and wiked proceadinges, presumynge & bea
               
                  •
               yng them selues, bolde vpon flesh, as

though thei had no nede of God towardes theyr enterprises, Yea as though thei nede not, once to axe god, whether he be pleased with theyr deuyses or no. And therfore God muste nedes haue greate pleasure and delite in thē, & must nedes be highly pleased wyth such presumption, and cōtempt of his grace and goodnes, & he vseth to geue very great successe and victori, to such presumptuous bosters and braggers: And that shal be this, that thei al shall be destroied, and not one of them left a lyue. For this are we sure of, that theyr ragyng enterprises are not in theyr owne power to accomplish, but stand al in Gods hand. And thei shal not so easelye bring theyr purpose to passe. God wil be master, and beare ye stroke among theim, in spite of theyr beards (as he hath euer yet done) and that shal thei wel feele.
            But let vs vaynely imagine (as it were in a slombre) that there were no God to let them, but that theyr practises and proceadynges myght go forward euen bi force, as thei wold haue

them. One of these two thynges are lyke to brede therof, either an vprour of certaine, or els a generall warre of the whole nacion against them, wher in a multitude both of theyr sorte and of ours also, mai fortune to com short home. For if they thinke in this case, that the Protestantes being diligently taught by our preachers the daunger of sedicion,Rebelliō & defence ar ii. things. for cōscience sake dare not styrre against thē in this case thei maye fortune to be deceiued: For the preachers haue done wel in so teachīg generally. But if our aduersaries wil admit one article of our doctrine, that maketh for theyr purpose, and refuse al the rest, peraduenture our men wil thinke also, that they may borow one poynt with them, seyng thei know, it is another thing to be a Rebel, than to be one of those, which stand in the defence of Goddes true religion, and of their natural countrey.
            And if it so come to passe (as it is to be feared, that Gods wrathe is so kindled, that he wil punysh vs wyth some notable scourge) let oure Potentates

thanke the Papistes, and theyr own
                  •
                Bishops, & Prelates, and those whose affections thei haue serued. Therfore they shal not say, these are the fruites of the gospel, or of the newe learning (as it pleaseth them to terme it) but they and al the world shal saye, these are the frutes of the stinkyng Papistry, and of the cankard Papists, and of theyr pestilent Prelates, and blin
                  •
                Bishops, which to blemish the lyght of Gods word, and to stablysh theyr Antichristes kingdome, haue ben the workers and practisers of such procedinges, as al true and godlye hartes, that haue anye sparkle of vnderstanding do abhorre. They therfore shall be gilty before God, of al the bloudshed that shal brede therof, & not our doctrine. And I trust that God & our Lord Iesus Christ shal preserue & deliuer vs, euen as he preserued and deliuered Loth in Sodōe. And if it happen any of vs to dye among the multitude, we must thank our Lord god, and thynke, that we haue lyued long inough, and wel deserued otherwyse

to dye. And yet shal we dye with better consciences, then they. For wher we haue wt the gospell taught peace & vnitie, they with theyr papistry haue bred such dissension and diuision, as those that are yet vnborne shal rewe, it they shoulde haue theyr purposes. And thys yet shall be a comfort vnto vs, that wher they and we shal go on pylgrimage together, we shal take our leaue honestly one of a nother, & depart a sonder, they with theyr lyes and bloud shedding to the pyt of hell and to the diuel (whom thei haue serued) and we to our Lord Iesus Christ whom we haue faithfullye serued, in professing & preaching his truth and peace. For this is easye to reken, that he that killeth me, or any of my companions in such an assembli, the same shall not muche spare the Papystes. Wherfore let vs go together, they in al diuels names vnto hel, and I with my brethren and felowes, in Gods name vnto heauen. As for mine own person, I am wel assured, that no mā can hurt me, no more thā I desyre to

hurt anye other. And they shall not worke so muche displeasure agaynst me one way, but I shall worke more against them another way. Thei shal not haue so hard heades in their naughty procedinges, but I shal haue as hard an head, in my lawful and godly enterprises, although not onli Emperour Charles but also the Turkish Emperour shuld take part with thē. They shall neuer feare me, nor make me to shrinke, but I wyl make them feare and shrinke. So farre haue they ouersene them selues already, that I and such thinges as I haue enterprised, and attempted, shal prosper, whā they with theyr procedinges shal decay, and be confounded. For my lyfe shal be theyr hang mā, and my death shal be theyr diuel. That and none other let them trust vnto, for they shall be sure therof, for al theyr laughing & triumphing that thei make now.An euyl consciēce can not prai faithfully. And if the Papistes shuld begin any war, we should not nede greatlye to feare them, for they cānot procede in theyr enterprises in the name of God, nor

can not with good consciences pray
                  •
                vnto God, for any successe. They can not pray frō theyr harts, so muche as thus: O God helpe vs in our procedings. For theyr owne cōsciences do accuse thē selues, yt theyr procedinges are naught & vngodly. And for ye christen religion, yt hath bene preached by vs, & set forth bi authoriti of our princes (which they now go about to suppresse) diuers of theyr own best Clerkes (as for the blinde asses, we do not regard) haue cōfessed & said, yt none of our doctrine is against any Article of the faith, nor against the scripture, but only against certen ordināces of their own church, & certē decres of ye pope. Therfor it is easi to perceiue, wt what cōscience they can attēpt any thing against our doctrine. And as for brynging Aliens into our naciō,Papistes do agaīst nature for their kingdōs sake. to haue ye gouernmēt among vs, & to subuert ye aunciēt priuilegies of their own natural coūtrey, I dare say, theyr own cō
               sciēce telleth thē that it is against nature. Now if thei shuld begin ani battayl, it must nedes be for one of these

two causes, whych being both yll in theyr own iudgement, how can they pray vnto god, for any good successe? And therfore we may wel speake this benediction ouer theym: As ye seeke Gods honor, & as good as your quarel and procedings are: euen such successe & victory God send you, Amen. And agayne, God can stirre vp a Iudas Machabeus, to be the captain of his flock, which shal beate thē down, and teach thē to be authors of wars, whan they mai haue peace. And whā soeuer they shall lye in the fielde, for mainteining of these procedinges of theyrs. I and my brethren shal crye & cal vnto God must earnestlye, wyth true and faithfull praier, that he wyll geue them a fearful, faint, cowardly & desparate hart, that here one, and ther one, thei may be pricked in their own cōsciences,The papistes procedings are both against god & theyr natural coū
                  trey. that they shal be forced to say: Alas Alas, why am I here for the maintenaunce of an yl quarel, which is both against God, and his word, & also against our own countrey. And when they se a true faithful and natural

hart, of Machabees host, cōming against thē, that they may take theyr feet, & rūne away frō him, as fast an chaffe flieth frō the winde. Thinke 
                  〈◊〉

Verely thus did he vnto the obstinate hard harted Egipcians, in the red sea, which wer as stout and as secure as the autors of these procedings be (namely the papish bishops & Prelates, & theyr adherentes) and had as good a quarel also, as they haue any.

Psalme of Dauid, which he praied whā he defended him selfe against Absolon, and at one slaughter (which was also the first) al Israel was beaten, & a thousand men slaine wt Absolon, of a veri smal armi. And yet Absolō & his army had ordinaūce, & puluer, and harnes inough.
            Now if the matter shuld come to a battel, as it is veri like (which god ye

rather for a necessari and a lauful act. And that can I proue by the Law, and the Lawyers cannot deny it. For in such case, whan such murtherers and bloudhoundes wil attempt and murther, for such vnlauful causes as these, without dout it can in no wyse be ryghtly named any vprour, for any mā to set and defend himself against thē.

For in case thei should set, and defende thē
               
selues, against the bloudsuppers, and practisers of such vnlauful procedīgs,Kepyng out or resistyng of the Spaniards is no rebellion. I woulde not that theyr conscience

For it wer a great preiudice, & to sore so to name them, in such case. Ther is a nother and a better name for them, which ye Lawyers know wel inough.
            We must not suffre euery thing to be called vprour and rebelliō, which ye bloudy bochers, Antichristes sworne champions, the practisers of all mischeife, do so falsely name. For that is one of theyr practises also,Note, note vnder the pretence and colour of vprour, and rebellion, to stoppe and to bind al mens mouthes and handes, that no man

We shal so define and declare the matter, that that subtiltie shal not serue them. It is not alwaies vproure, nor rebellion,Marke wel. to do agaynst euery lawe, for th

But that man maye be called a rebel, or a mayntainer of vprour which wil suffre no maiestrate to rule nor no law to take place, but wil ryse against the maiestrate, to depriue him to the intent to be ruler & Maiestrate himself, and to make what lawes him lusteth, as the head Capitain of the Anabaptistes did at Monster in Westphalia.To wythstande the b. of rome is no rebelion, but a keping of our othe & most boū
                  den duty. Such one may wel be called a maītainer of vprour, and a rebel. For, Aliud est inuasor, aliud defensor. For a rebel and a defendor are two things. So that it can be no vprour nor rebellion, for a man to defend himself against the wiked practises, and vnlauful proceadyngs of bloudsuppers Papistes.

But thei them selues, that wil begyn warres to maītain by force theyr wicked procedings against God and against their natural coūtrei, thei may well be called rebels and traytors to God and theyr countrei:The Papistes are traitours bothe to God, the Realme, & to nature. Yea ther are no greater traitors nor rebels thā the Papistes & the bloudthyrsty bishops and prelates and suche as take part wt them. For they lyke very abhominable murtherers and traytors, of very mischife and spite, do work both against God and also against nature. And that may easely be proued.

For at the great coūcel of the Empyre that was holden at Augspurge, Cardinal Nicolas,The Bishop of Augspurge. ye bishop of Augspurge, sayd: that he could wel be content that the same religion that was at Wittēberg, shold be receiued generally, sauying that he could not abyde that it should begyn and spring, in such a corner of no reputation, as Wittemberge is. How lyke

ye this gere? Are not these Ioly wordes to come out of a byshops mouth?Campegius. And in like maner Cardinal Campegius, the Popes Legate, did cōfesse at the same councell, that he coulde consent that that religion should be suffered in Germany, but that it would be a great ensample for other nations to requyre the same also, and for yt cause it were in no wyse to be graūted. And a nother great bishop of theyrs sayde these wordes, cōcernyng theyr disputers & learned men:The Papists own confessiō

                Our learned men do defend vs pretely, for they confesse them selues, that our fayth whiche we haue folowed these many yeres, hath no ground vpon the scripture, but only vpon the Decrees and determinations of the coūsels. Al this to be true diuers noble men, yt heard it, can testifie. And besydes, one Wynchestre a bishop in England,Wynche

                like haue other bishops of Englād also done, which are notwithstanding no enemies to ye pope. For althoughe they woulde haue him to be theyr supreme heade, yet haue thei proued in theyr boltes, that he cannot chalenge any supremacy, by the scriptures and worde of God. So that the verye papistes them selues knowe that our religion and doctrine is no false doctrin but grounded vpon the scripturs and the word of God. And yet of very malice and spite, thei would condemne & rote out our religiō by very force and violence, contrary to al right & reasō. And wher it was requyred in the general Parliament or councel, that no

Truth loueth the light. and refuseth the light, that his doyngs should not be reproued and disclosed. But he that doth the truth, cōmeth to ye light, that his works may be openly knowne because thei are done in God. Ther is neuer an Article of our doctrine & religion, but we are able & redye to proue it by the manifest worde of God. Thus muche concernyng our religion. And as concerning the other poynt yt they wold so fayn bring to passe, that straū
               gers and Alianes should haue the gouernement of our nation, if thei wold speak according to their owne hearts & consciences, I would desire none other iudges but euē thē selues. Wherfore it is they that are the authours of vprour, and verye traitours, rebelles, whych wyll attempte warres for the maintenaūce of their tiranny and wicked

practises. And to shewe my selfe a true Pastor and prophet, and to bear a true hart vnto my natiue countrey▪ I wyl giue my deare countrey mē a faifhful warning and instructiō how to behaue them selues,Do after this counsaile. that they rūne not into any peryl & daūger of soule, in obeing the procedings of the bloudy Papistes, against God and theyr natural coūtrey. The daunger wherof doutles is very great. And this wil I do, to the intent that no man hereafter may excuse him selfe and say: Non putassē, I wold neuer haue thought that the daunger had bene so greate. Now he that wyl folow my councel, let him take it, and he that wil not, let him leaue it, but no man shal say, but that he was warned.
            And my true and faithful aduertisment is this, that if the Emperour or any other prince shoulde go about, to maintain the procedinges aboue specified by force of armes, and shoulde commaund al men to prepare thē selues, and to be in a redines to aid him▪ that ye my deare coūtrey men, do in

no wise harken to any such cōmaundement, nor in any wyse obeye hym. For in such case no man ought to obei nether King nor Keiser, but shuld offend and disobey God, and should cast both his body and soule into perpetual peril and daunger, if he should obei. For the Emperour or ani other prince (what so euer he were) in so doing, shuld do manifestly against god,This is not mans aduise, but Gods cō
                  mādemēt. and against all right. And that no mā should thinke, that this coūcel spryngeth of mine owne braine & fansye, I wil shew the such strong reasons and arguments, that thou shalt fele at thy fingers endes, that it is not onlye my councel, but Gods owne earnest and most straight cōmaundement, whose heauye displeasure al men oughte to feare and to tremble therat, as they must do at lenght.
            The fyrst cause why no mā ought to obey Emperour nor kyng in such case (specially in the cause of religion) 
                  •
               s thys.The fyrste cause why no manne oughte to obeye to ye mayntenaunce of popery. Euerye particular man hath promised and vowed in his baptisme

               euen as wel as the Kayser hym self)

to kepe and maintaine the Gospell of Christ, & not to persecute it or to work any thyng ther against. Wherfore to the cōmaundement of the Emperour or of thy prynce (whatsoeuer he be) yu maist make this answer:Aunswer to the magistrate. Most noble Emperour or prince, if you did keepe your othe or vowe whiche you made in your Baptisme, you should be my most dere and liege Lord, and I wold obey you with al my hert▪ But if you wyl not kepe your promes and christian couenaunt made with Christ in your Baptisme, but persecute ye same obey who wyll, I will not blaspheme my Lord, nor be one of them that shal help to persecute his word, & so runne and cast my selfe headlonges into the pitt of hel with you, for your pleasure.
            
               He that mainteyneth poperye, fyghteth against god & 
                     •
                  l his creatures.This is the fyrst cause, which comprehēdeth in it many other great and weightie causes. For whosoeuer fighteth or draweth his sword against the Gospel: the same doth fighte & drawe his sword against God himself, against Iesus Christ, our onli sauior against the holy gost, against the precious

bloude of Christ, agaynst his death, against Gods word, against al the Articles of the Christian fayth, against ye true ministraciō of al the Sacramēts against al the Doctrine and Religion which is geuē, confyrmed and approued through ye gospel. And to be short against al Angels and saintes, against heauen and earth, and against al creatures. For he yt striueth against God, must nedes also striue against all that belōgeth vnto God or holdeth of him And against al these shal thy obediēce minister ayde and helpe, and so shalte thou begiltie before God of all these thinges befor rehearsed. And therfore what reward thou shalt haue therfore of God at length, thou mayest easely gather thi selfe. And this maketh also the matter ye more greuous, forasmuch as yu shalt do al these thynges wittingly, & against thyne own conciēce▪ And in this case thou shalte do worse, than al Turkes & Tartarians, Iewes and Panimes. For where thei doo obaye theyr heades in persecuting the Gospel, they do it of ignoraunce and

know not what they do, so doest no
                  •
                thou. Wherfore thou must needes be much worse, & suffer ten tymes more greuous damnation, them ani Turke or Paname.
            Now although it be an heuy and a miserable thyng to consider that the matter is come to this poynt among Christen men, that they shoulde haue any nede of ani such aduertisment as this. And though thei thē selfes knew not, what a terrible & heuy thing it is to resist agaīst gods word: or to shew any obediēce or token of obediēce, in such things as are cōtrary, repugnāt & iniurious to the same (for it is a manifest token yt euen in Christēdom among Christiās, ther ar worser Turkes thā are either in Turky or in hel) Yet such as be true Christiās in dede (althoughe there be fewe of them) do know wel inough thē selues what to do in such case,The great Turk him selfe is not so mad as to rage & raue againste hys own Mahomet & Al

                  orā as our diuels ye Papists do agaīst ye gospel yt they were professed vnto, in their baptisme: wherfor ye Turkes mai be angels in respecte of ye Papistes, & the papistes very Diuels in respecte of the turks. & haue no nede of any such admonicion as this: But the papistes, which bear the name & shine of Christiās (& yet are ten tymes worse than Turkes) must be admonished &

warned. If it will do thē any good, it is wel, if not, yet shal they haue ye lesse to excuse them selues with, and must looke for the more greuous damnacion. Now to the second cause.
            The second cause why men ought not to obey in such case, is this: Though our doctrine were not right (as it is most right and true) yet ought this to feare men frō shewing them selues obedient in such case, for as muche as by such obedience, they should make them selues giltye & partakers before God of all the abhomination that is al ready cōmitted, or shal hereafter be co

               mitted in the whole Papistri. This cause cōprehendeth infinite abhomynacions, al wickednes, sin, & daūger ye a man in maner can reken. In sūma, in this cause is hel it selfe with all the sins that are therin, wherof thou shuldest make thy self partaker if yu shouldest obei ether Keiser or King in such case. And to the intent that yu mayest more plainly see what they be, I wyl here rehearse some of thē. For the papistes pretende suche an holinesse as

though they were angels, & they wil
                  •
                not heare of any of these abhominacions, & so they neuer repent for thē, nor neuer amend thē.
                  The Papistes syt vp, but thei amēd not.
                  Horedōe.
                First yu shalt make thi self partaker of al their filthi liuīg▪ yt they haue led, & yet leade. For they neuer purpose to amēd ani part therof. And al yt shouldest thou help to defend & maintain by thy obediēce. And by that meanes should light vpon thi neck al the whordom & filthines, that is vsed in theyr Colleges & cathedrall churches.A sorte of holy gentlemen. And thy cōsciēce shuld haue thys to reioyce & to triumphe of, that thi obedience hath holpē to maintain the most abhominable whormōgers & villanes vpō earth, and to defend the most abhominable liuing that can be thought. Yea, and if the Emperour or any other prince should attempt any war for the matter, if thou shouldest take part with him, thou shuldest vē
               ter thy lyfe and bloud for such abhominable wretches. Oh thys were a goodly thing for thi conscience to triumphe of.Buggeri. Furthermore thou muste make thy selfe also partaker of the

chastitie of the Pope, and of his Cardinals, which is a wonderful chastity aboue al other Ecclesiastical chastity, which they cal in the Italian tounge Puseronen, that is such chastitie as ye Sodomites and Gomorrhianes dyd vse. For so suffereth god his arch enemies the Pope & his Cardinals to be blinded aboue other, that thei can not be cōtent only to offend with woman kinde, but according to theyr well deserued reward, they defyle thē selues and theyr own bodies one wyth another most beastli, & ar so depely drowned in yt horrible vice, & so blynded in their hardened harts, yt they coūt that abhominacion for no synne at al, but make a iesting & a laughing matter of it, as though ther were no more peril nor danger therin, thā in a game at tables or cardes. Go thi wai now & defend & maintain wt thi obedience these beasts past al shame & repētāce, which make but a iest & a christmas game of such an horrible vice▪ And it is no lye that I wryte here in thys matter, for such as haue bene at Rome do know

wel inough that more abhomination is there vsed than any man cā reherse or beleue.

Wherby euery man may iudge, that they made than at Rome but a very sporte and mocke of euerlastynge lyfe. For it is an euident testimony, that their commō belefe was there, that there was no euerlastyng life. And therfore they would teach them the contrary with a Bull, and decree of theyr councell. And yet besides that, ther was set another prety decree also in the same bull, whiche was this: That from thence furth the Cardinals should not kepe so manye male stewes as thei vsed to doe. But pope Leo commaunded that to be striken out, least al the world shoulde suspect (as they might wel do) and haue

knowledge howe opēly and without al shame the Pope and his cardinals did maintain Sodom, euen at Rome. And ther is no Pope, cardinal, bishop doctor, preist, nor religious man, that

I thyncke no tong vpō earth can rehearse al the abhominacions of the papistry, but by these pointes nowe rehearsed and by the dayly ensamples that thei practise, we maye easly gather the rest.The pope is Antichrist. And if it wer not that the Pope must nedes be the very Antichrist & his adherentes Antichristes impes, whiche in al thinges must euermore be contrarye to Christ, men might meruel and wondre howe thei could so continually vse so muche abhomination. But seyng it is so,The life, & doctrin of Christe & ye pope are contrari ye one to the other. & can no notherwyse be, it must nedes consequently folowe, that lyke as Christ did lead and teach a most pure, sincere excellent, chast, sobre, holy, and godly lyfe: Euen so contrary wise must this Antichrist the pope and his adherēts, leade, teach & maintain, a most shameful, blasphemous, filthi, curssed, beastli abhominable, hellish life: how could he else in al pointes declare himself to be the enemy of Christ and the verye ryght Antichrist? And yet al theyr abhominaciōs might the better be born

if they did not so earnestli defend thē, & wold make al the world beleue (perforce) yt they did nothing but wel and right in al theyr doinges.

Yea, eueri true Christian ought rather to spend his bloud, life, goodes, & al together in the cōfession & defēce of the true honor & religion of God, thā for the keping of them, to indaunger both bodi & soule with eternal destruction, thorow folowing & obeing their doctrine: The infinite abhominaciōs & errours wherof (which they defend & maintaine as right, true and lauful, neuer intending to refourme or alter one iote thereof) I am not able to reherse▪ All the daunger whereof shalt

For whosoeuer setteth his truste in anye other thyng (whatsoeuer it be) sauing in Christ only, the same can haue no truste at al in Christ.

And yet ther is no repentaunce nor amendement in thē, but they rather labor & studi, how thei mai be defēded & mainteined, in these naughty procedinges.
            And yet more, who so euer shall obey either Emperour, King or prince in this case, shall also make hym selfe gilty and partaker of al ye abhominacion & blasphemy,The vertue of the holi mas, cursed myght it be. that is conteined in the wicked & detestable Masse and of the infinite idolatry & blasphemi, that is therin cōmitted, against ye true vse of the holy sacrament of Christes body and bloud. As first of the fained sacrifice, pretēding to offer vp daily vnto God, his own dere sōn, as though thei wer better & holier then the sonne of God. And so they are not contēt, ye holy sacrament to be an ordinaūce of God, which mē shuld receiue in faith, but they make a sacrifice & an oblaciō
               
of it, wher with they wil reconsile thē selues and other vnto God, and wyl make also a salue of it, for euery sore. Yea, for euery saint, ther is a peculiar Masse, & for euery disease & aduēture what so euer it be, a peculiar Masse. in al their bokes & doctrine, a mā shall not finde one word of faith, but all is full of the Masse, the Masse, what a sacrifice, & what an holy thing yt masse is, wher as ther is no ceremoni, wher in faith is so much required and exercised, as in the true institucion & celebraciō of the Sacramēt, being rightli administred, forasmuch as Christ him selfe did institute it, for a remēbraunce & memorial of himselfe, that al men in the celebration therof, shuld preach of him, remēber him, and beleue in him. But in stede of that, they preach & set furth their oblacion & sacrifice, & their own inuencion, & most abhominably bye & sel therwyth. Here I ouerpasse the idolatry that is cōmitted at the eleuacion of their false Masse god,Stoupe a

that are cōmitted only in the Masse? If they had brought vp no nother errour nor abuse of the holy sacrament▪ but only to make a gaping and a gasyng stocke of it, as they vse to doo at theyr high feastful dayes, & speciallye vpon their church holy daies, carieng it about in theyr processiōs, & making (as it wer) a Christmas game with it, only that the priestes (at such tymes) may fyl theyr bellies, & get monye of the simple people for their labor. This abuse & prophanacion of the Sacrament, were more thē horrible inough. But yet thys is nothing to this most greuous abuse, that they wil make of the cōmon Sacramēt,Greased and anoī

            And yet this augmenteth the blasphemy somewhat the more also, that they conceale & kepe secret the words & faith of the sacrament, murmuring

then secretly to them selues, contrary to the manyfest doctrine of Saynte Paule, sayng as oft as ye shal do this, ye shall preache and shewe fourthe (and not kepe close, and murmure secretli) the death of the Lord. S. Paule sayth: Ye shal preach & shew furth▪ &c. And thei do clean contrary. But the abuses of the papistry ar so many, that no toung can reproue or paint thē out sufficiētly.Euery abhominacion is set foorth by one deuill at least, but ye mas was made and set forth by ye ful cōsent of all the hole chapter house of diuels. Other abhominatiōs haue euery one a peculiar and a particuler deuyl workyng in them, but I take ye Masse to be a worke of al the deuyls in hel together, wherūto they al haue cast and layd al theyr heades, al theyr handes, all theyr diuises, yea all theyr knauery and wikednes together, and so finished this detestable abhominacion. And this mai appear by the false deceiuable spirites, whiche (vnder the colour of dead mēs soules) appear in diuers places, crieng for Soulmasses, wher as we neuer herd of any of thē, that euer cried or called for Christ, nor for any help of him, but al for masses. Which is a very strong profe and euident token, that the deuyl liueth in no

one thyng so effectuously,The diuel lyueth in nothīg so effectousli as in the mas, and mas priestes. as he doth in the Masse & in the masse marchāts which through theyr abhominable filthy lyfe, couetousnes, blasphemies & other abhominations▪ do most shamfully maintaine and entertaine hym. And doubtles it is the highest and last uengeaunce and wrath of God vpon earth, that shal appeare before the latter daye. For there can be no greater. These are ye vertues, which thou shalt helpe to maintaine, by thy obedience to theyr procedyngs. Nowe if any mā peraduenture bee offended with me, for vsyng so sharpe & taunting words agaynst them, I woulde desyre theim to take this for a sufficient answer vnto thē:Thoughe they be knaues bi theyr order, yet they ar gē

Philip Melancthō, master Iohn Brentius happened to say, that there was not one worde in al the scripture to be found, of the inuocation of saintes, Than stepte Cochleus furth (lyke a profoūd clarke) to helpe the matter and sayde▪ that there was nothyng in the olde testament, to proue the inuocation of saintes, because ther wer no saynctes in heauen, whan the olde testamēt was written: but thei wer al at that tyme in Limbo Patrum.

               on, whiche hearde al theyr reasoning, sayde thus vnto Eckius: There hath Cochleus answered your text, yt you aledged out of the olde testament so sure ar these noble doctors of their doctrin, and so wel do they agree tother, that one of them saith ther is no thing in the old testamēt to proue the inuocatiō of saintes wt. And a nother alegeth autoritie out of ye old testamēt to proue it: As though we knewe not, yt god wrought al the miracles, which wer done in the Old testament for Abrahās, Isaackes & Iacobs sake (as he

him selfe, oft times doth testify) & not for any saintes sake in the new Testamēt. And from whence do they fetch theyr profes to proue theyr doctryne trow ye? out of noble authors I warrant you, euen out of olde barbrous Dōses. I red once in a boke of theirs, which was a boke of Moralizacions, how the Virgin Marye ought to be worshipped with offerings & gyftes. And why? Mary, for this cause: Ther was once a thefe which was one that robbed by the high way,A great miracle of our ladi of Cādelmas which neuer did good al his life long, sauyng that he hapned once by chaūce to come into a Churche vpon Candlemas day▪ wher, seyng the people offeryng mony & candels vpon the altare, he offered ther also as other dyd. After that the same thefe was taken for robbry, and hanged. Whan he was dead, the diuils wold haue had his soule to hel. But ther was a good angel, yt wythstode thē, saying vnto the diuels, whi wold ye take this man awai, seing ye haue nothing to do wyth him, nor no power ouer him? The diuils made answer

agayne and saide: He hath done much euyl and mischiefe, & neuer dyd good in al his life.Dyuels stād befor gods iudgemente seat amōg ye Angels, and thā ye i. Psalme is not tru neque pecatores in concilio in storum. Godyles soles haue handes. So thei went together before the iudgemēt seate of god, and ther the diuels accused the theefe, that he had neuer don any good. Thē the good angel brought forth ye crosse peny, together with the candle, which he had offered vpon the altar. Vpon ye the iugge gaue sentence, that the these should defend him selfe against the diuels. And ye angel gaue him this coū

            Who wold euer haue beleued, that they had had, such strong reasons to proue theyr doctrine with, if we had not theyr bokes for wytnesses? Yea,

the Monkes, friers and priestes haue stuffed theyr bokes ful of such begerly fables, to blear and blind al christē
               dome with. And ther was neuer yet any Pope, Byshop, nor doctor that euer found faut with suche geare. But now that men preach Christ to be the only sauior of al mankinde, they rage and raue, as though thei wer besides them selues. Whan mē preached that A candle or a peney offered vnto our Lady, was of such force that it coulde deliuer an vnrepentaunt wretche and murtherer, both Christ and fayth sett a part, and could chace awaye the deuyl: Whan mē thus preached (I say) Blasphemynge, and (as it were) treadynge vnder theyr feete the passion & merites of Christ, thā were al sermōs good and catholyke,Pestilent catholick. and than wer no heritickes in the world. &c. Dooth not this wel verifye the Bishops saiyng▪ That priestes were neuer yet good?
            Wel let vs yet rehearse somewhat more of their stuffe: How wil any mā be able to bear vpon his conscience, y• intollerable violence and force, which

thei haue wrought vnto al the world, with theyr eare confession, wherwith thei haue brought infinit soules to desperation,Auricule
                     •
                   confessiō. and haue robbed and spoyled many sorowful heartes, of al christen comfort? For lyke very traytors, and abhominable wretches, they made no maner of menciō, nor spake neuer a word, of the true vertue and power of the keyes, nor of faith, but forced onely vpon tedious and intollerable torment of perticuler nombring & rehearsyng of sinnes, and of doīg iust pennance, and impossible satisfaction therfore. And vnto such enumeration and satisfaction (as a worcke of theyr owne) thei ascribed the purchasing of Gods sauour, and of euerlasting saluation: so that Christ might go playe him, as one that had nothing to do wt that matter. And thus thei led & kepte men quite from Christ, & taught them to put theyr trust in theim selues, and in theyr owne and other mēs workes and desertes.

Which abuse only (if ther were no more but that) hath worthely deserued, that all men should wysh the papacy to synk and to perish, much lesse to shew anye obediēce, or to minister ani aid, wherby it might be maintained. How hath the Pope ruffled (and plaied Rex Regum) with that thounderbolt of hys curse and excōmunication, agaynste Emperours, Kinges, and agaynst al the world? Yea against God himselfe and his holy word. For what so euer the dyuel had put in hys minde, that must go forward, and be accepted as right and lauful. What wars & effusion of bloud hath he caused therethorow in the world: Yea, who is able to rehearse al the abhomination, that it hath bredde? What so euer the Pope wold haue to be synne, or to be called syn, that must nedes so be. And what so euer pleased him to be named good & godly, that must nedes so be, so that he must be a most dredful Lord ouer the whole world, ouer bodye & soule,

lands & goodes, ouer purgatory, ouer hel, ouer the diuell, ouer heauen, ouer angels, ouer God, & ouer altogether. Heauen was opē, or shut, to whō soeuer it pleased him: And so was hel like wise. Whō soeuer it had pleased him, shoulde haue kept or lost hys bodye▪ goodes, estimacion, landes, heritage▪ wife, childrē, house, mony and al such things. Yea, if this abuse of the keyes had not bene, what had the papacye bene? And al this haue thei done of very wilfulnes & force (against all ryght and reason) euen for very pompe, and for theyr bellies sake, misusing (most wretchedly) the holy name of god, for the maintenaunce therof. For vnder the name and pretense of God, haue they wrought al their detestable mischiefe and tirannye. For the whyche they neuer once minde to repent, but (like obstinate beastes) cōtinue styl in theyr wickednes, defending & mainteinyng it, what so euer any mā hath said or written neuer so truly there against. It were litle wonder, if heauen and earth shuld open or vtterly burst,

for such abhominacion, or that God wold suffer such continual wretchednes, spite, & misbehauour any longer vnreuēged. I thinke that if the great Turke knew him selfe to be so wiked, & such a wretch, as the Papists know them selues to be desperate caitiues, he wold not be so obstinate, nor so desperately and spitefully defi god with his abhominaciō. And I think also yt the great Turke wold neuer say:The Pastes boast of theym selues. We Tukes wer neuer good: as ye papistes shame not to make theyr boast, sayīg: We Priestes were yet neuer good. But it is the veri diuel that possesseth them,The pope foloweth the diuel▪

               heuous abhominacions that I haue reckened? I say and wil abide therby, that nothyng so much. Here must I leaue vnrehersed, for auoidyng of tediousnes, a nomber of abhominaciōs whych I haue not yet spoken of, as vowes to pilgrimages, brotherhods▪ byeng and selling of theyr woorkes▪ and of theyr cowles and such lyke.
            Now to the thyrde and last cause▪
               
why no man ought to ayde or obeye Emperour, Kyng or Prince in thys case, which is this: If thou shuldest obey or aid the Emperour, thy King▪ thy Quene, Prince, or Magistrate in such case, forasmuch as they mind by such procedinges of theirs to stablish Antichristes kingdom, thou shalt not onlye (by thy obedience & aide) make thy selfe partaker of al these abhominacions before rehersed; but thy obedience & aide also, shal serue & help, to subuert and to roote out al the good▪ that hath bene done or wrought by ye gospel. For these archecaitiues ar not content to maintaine these abhominacions, but also they labour (all that they can) vtterly to abolysh & to roote out for euer al the goodnes, which the doctrine of the Gospell, or the Preachers & professors therof haue taught wrought, or brought to passe.
            This cause cōprehēdeth much matter in it, & is a veri weighti cause. For the doctrine of the gospel which hath ben ernestly preached & taught bi vs▪ hath wrought much good, thākes be vnto

God before.What good hath ben done by ye preachynge of the gospel For before the doctrine therof was preached & taughte by our brethren, no man knew what the gospel ment. No man knewe what Christ was. No man knewe what Baptisme or penaūce was. No man knew what fayth or good workes were. No man knew what a sacrament was. No man knew what flesh or spirit was. No mā knew, what the .X. commaundementes, what the Lordes prayer, or what the Crede ment. No man knew what praier was. No manne knew howe to bear the crosse, or howe to take afflicion, nor yet how to comfort himself in any aduersitie. No man knewe before what y• true office of a Maiestrat was Nor no man knewe, what the state of holy Matrimony was. No mā knew what was the office of parentes towardes theyr children, of Masters and mistresses towardes theyr seruaūtes▪ and maydes, nor yet of Children, seruauntes and maydes towardes theyr parentes, masters and dames. No mā knew before, what the deuyl or what the worlde was: What lyfe or death

was. No mā knew rightlie, what was Synne, or what was Vertue, nor yet what forgeuenes of synnes was, no

                wher to be sought▪ No mā knew what God was. No mā knew what it was to be a byshop, or what it was to be a pastor, and to haue charge of soul. No man knew also rightly, what ye church was, nor what authoritie it hadde. No nor no man knewe▪ what it was to be a christian. Shall I saye altogether in fewe wordes? No mā knew any thing at all, that euery true Christian ought to haue known. For the pope and papistical asses, had blinded al the world and oppressed al men with ignoraūce. I may wel cal them asses▪ for they are very grosse and vnlearned asseheades in al matters of Christian religion, in 
                  •
               ede. For they knowe, or at the least thei wyl know nothyng elce, but that the saluation of Men and women dependeth, vpon mōkes and fryers and such lyke, and vpon their workes and merites, and not vpon Christ at al. Wher as the doctrine which we haue 
                  •
               aught, hath brought to passe, that diuers

men, wemen, and children (thankes be vnto God) knowe the principles of Christian religion; and how al men ought to beleue, howe to praye, how to take the crosse, how to lyue, & how to die. The true vnderstāding of these & many other articles hath bene opened throughe the diligence of our preachers. The true vse also of the lordes table,Yea, but now farewel truth seing our pore preachers are chopped vp. and of the Font, wherin all people are consecrated vnto God thorow Baptisme, hath by our preachers & teachers bene brought to light, so yt al men (thankes be to God) may se in theyr ordre the very ryght fourme of a Christian church. Al this shalte thou help, through thy obediēce, to subuert and to cōdemne, whosoeuer thou are, that shalt obey them in theyr proceadyngs. And furthermore also thy ayd and obedience shal serue, and helpe to burne and destroy the olde and newe Testament in our in other tounge, the holy Psalter and other bokes of godly praiers in our mother tounge, and al other good bookes and most godly and necessary workes▪ whiche our

preachers & teachers haue written, as the papistes them selues cannot deni. And thy obedience shal also serue an

                helpe to this, that no man from hence furth shal know the X. Commaundementes, the Articles of the Christian faith, The Lordes praier. (For so was it before the doctrine that we professe was preached.) And thy obed
                  •
               ēce shal serue likewise, that no mā shal hereafter learn any good instructiōs of baptisme, of the Lords supper, of fayth, of the Gospel, of the true christian libertie, nor of anye other godly article.
            Item, thy obedience shal serue and helpe, that no man maye put his trust and affiaunce rightly vpō Christ. And yet more than this, it shall also serue & helpe, that men shal put that trust and confidence that is due vnto Christ only, in the works and merites of monkes, friers and priestes, and that they shal bye theyr merites and cowles at ye hour of their death. Thou shalt hel

filthy and vnnatural sinnes of pristes and votaries. And yet further by helping with thy ayde and obedience, to maintain theyr abhominable marchā
               dise which they make with theyr idolatrous masse sacrifice, thou shalt make thy selfe partaker of al the couetousnes, robbry and theft, wherwith they haue gotten al theyr possessions. And what shal I say more? Thou shalt help therwith vtterly to subuerte Christes word and whole kingdome, and to restore, and maintain the deuyls kyngdome. For that thyng do the mischeuous captiues the Papistes, and the authors of these proceadings mind to do. Thei are Antichristes ministers, & therfore thei can mind nor do nothīg but that which is contrary to Christ, Specialli in the cheif article of our saluation, which is this, that our hearte, comfort, and affians of saluatiō shuld rest onely vpon Christ, and not in ani worckes of our owne, that is to saye, that we should beleue to be saued and to be deliuered from our sīnes, and to be made righteous only through true

For take thys article away, and than take away the churche. For without this Article, no errour can be resisted. For asmuch as wtout this article, Christ wyll not, nor cannot be with vs. For this is the article that must declare and open christ vnto vs. For this articles sake, hath ye worlde ofte bene plaged, through the sinne floud, through greate tempestes, thorow warres and diuers other kindes of plages. For this articles sake, was Abel murthered and many other martyres. And yet it remaineth & shal remayn, let the aduersaries do, & practise what thei wyl this Article shal remaine, whan they shall go to wrake & perishe in the pit of hel.

               O Lord, almighty god and heauenly father, we haue verelye wel deserued that thou shouldest punish & correct vs. But we besech the most gracious father, that thou wilt punish & correct vs thy selfe fauourably and with mercy, and not in thy fury and indignation. It is better for vs, O Lorde, to submyt our selues vnder thy rod and correction, & to yeld our selues into thy hands, thā into the handes of men, or of our enemies. For great is thi mercy. Against the (O Lord) haue we sinned, we haue not kept thy word and cōmaundemē
               tes, we haue done euyll in thy syght. But we haue done nothyng, for the which the diuel or the Pope and hys ministers ought iustlye to correct vs, neyther haue they any authoritye to correct or punish vs. But thou maiest vse them as thy terrible rods againste

vs, forasmuche as we haue synned against thee, and therwith worthelye deserued most greuous punishment. No Lorde, we haue done no offence▪ for the which thei ought ius
                  •
               ly to punishe vs. But thys is theyr seekyng that we shoulde most blasphemously synne and offend against thee as they do. That we should disobey thee for theyr pleasures, and blaspheme thee, and committe idolatrye and supersticion, and beleue in fables and false doctrine and religion as thei do. And so that we would so do, they care not what whoredome, murther, theft, filthynes or what other abhominacion so euer we dyd otherwyse. But thys is all the synne whych we haue done agaynst theym, that we professe and confesse thee, which art our God and Father, wyth thy Sonne our Sauiour Iesus Christ, and the holy Gost▪ to be the onelye true God.
            For if we woulde forsake, and deny the and thy word, which thou hast reueled vnto vs, both the dyuel & the Pope wyth al theyr ministers wold

let vs alone, & suffer vs to lyue in rest.
            Wherfor thou merciful father, and most ernest iudge ouer our enemies, cast thine eyes vpon vs. For they are thy enemies, more thē they be our enemies. And in that they persecute & vexe vs, they persecute and vexe thee. For that word which we do professe and beleue, is not ours but thyne: & al together is the working of thy holye Ghost in vs. Which thing the Diuel & the Pope with such other enemyes of thine can not abide. But thei wold be our God in thy place, & in stede of thy word, they woulde establish lyes. For the Pope in stede of the most pre

But thou (O Lord) suffer vs not to be trodē vnder fote, & to haue an ouerthrow of them, which seke not to punyshe or correct vs for our sins, but rather that thy name, thy word & workes should not be had in remēbraūce among vs, but vtterli quenched, that thou shouldest no more be a God, nor no more haue anye flocke or people to prayse, professe & confesse the. For they cast a way thy word, & set vp theyr own inuencions. They subuert the true vse of thy sacraments, & set vp idolatrous ceremonies. They banish and kepe in prison the true preachers of thi word▪ and send abrode false teachers, bellye Gods & shameles Hipocrites. They minde vtterly to subuert thy truth, & al godlines, & to plant al hipocrisye & abhominaciō. Wherfore good Lorde (of thy mercy) abate thou theyr pride, asswage thou theyr malice, confoūd & disapoint thou al theyr deuises & practises, deliuer thy Turtle doue, thine elect, out of theyr handes: that thei and
