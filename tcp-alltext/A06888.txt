               est on hye to escape frō ye power of mysfortune. The very stones of the wal shal crye out of it saith this holi ꝓphet & though it be far of for a tyme, yet at the laste shall it come to passe & not

fayle. Oh thē in that daye what accōpt wilt yu make of thy Baylywyke, what answere wilt thou make of the wytholding a way ye goodes of the poore / shalte yu not rēder a streat accompt therof yea truly, to thi vtter dānatiō. Therfore beware how yu getteth riches & whē thou hast gottē thē, that yu dispose thē godly vpō thy poore brethren by kynde for whose vse they ar geuē vnto ye & not onely vnto thyne own as I haue before declared vnto the in this simple tretyse, & learne of ye wise precher Ecclesiastes what holsome & frutful instructiōs he geueth toEccle▪ ii. soche eouetous ryche mē, whych be so insaciable in gatheringe & heapynge vp of goodes & neuer cōtented, thus saythe he. I was weary of my labour which I had takē vnder the Sūne, because I

should be fayne, to leaue thē vnto another mā, yt cometh after me & who knoweth whether he shall be a wyse mā, or a foule, and yet shal he be lord of al my laboures Is not this a vayne thing & a very vanitie. That a mā shal leaue his laboures, vnto another that neuer swet for thē. Therfore I ꝑceaue ther is nothinge better for a man, thā to be ioyful in his laboure, & to bestowe & distrubute his goodes whiles he lyueth, for that is his porcion, for who wyl bryng hym to se the thyng, yt shal come after hym, for as they be al dust, so shall they all turne vnto duste agayn, now here hast thou hard by the word of god in what perel & Ieoperdie, The ryche couetous mā stādeth in whē he shal gyue vp his reconīg at ye last day & how he ought to distribute & bestowe

thē, of the nedy & poore, so that in the so doying he may aduoyde the daūger of eternal dāpnatiō. And to obtayne ye celestial ioyes of heauē vnto yt which god bring vs all.
            So be it.
