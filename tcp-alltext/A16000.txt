            W. T. vn to the Chriſten reader.
            
               AS ye ēvious Philiſtenes ſtopped ye weſſes of Abraham ād filled them vpp with erth / t
                  •
                put ye memoriall out of mīde / to ye entent yt they might chalenge y• grounde: even ſo the fleſhly mīded ypocrites ſtoppe vpp the vaynes of life which are in y• ſcripture / wt the erth of theyr tradiciōs / falſe ſimilitudes & lienge allegories: & y• of like zele / to make y• ſcripture theyr awne poſſeſſiō & marchaundice: and ſo ſhutt vpp the kingdome of heven which is Gods worde nether enterīge in thē ſelues nor ſoferinge them that wolde.
            ¶ The ſcripture hath a body with out / ād within a ſoule / ſprite & life. It hath wt out a barke / a ſhell ād as it were an hard bone for y• fleſhly mynded to gnaw vppon. And within it hath pith / cornell / mary & all ſwetneſſe for Gods electe which he hath choſen to geve them his ſpirite / & to write his law & y• faith of his ſonne in their hertes.
            ¶ The ſcripture cōteyneth. iij. thīges in it firſt y• law to cōdemne all fleſh: ſecōdaryly y• Goſpell / yt is to ſaye / promiſes of mercie

for all yt repent & knowlege their ſinnes at the preachīge of ye law & cōſent in their hertes that the law is good / & ſubmitte themſelues to be ſcolers to lern to kepe the lawe & to lerne to beleue y• mercie that is promiſed thē: & thridly the ſtories & liues of thoſe ſcolars / both what chaunces fortuned thē / & alſo by what meanes their ſcolemaſter taught thē and made them perfecte / & how he tried the true from the falſe.
            ¶ When ye ypocrites come to y• lawe / they put gloſes to ād make no moare of it then of a worldly law which is ſatiſfied with y• outwarde worke and which a turke maye alſo fulfill. Whē yet Gods law never ceaſeth to cōdemne a man vntill it be written in his herte and vntill he kepe it naturally without cōpulſion & all other reſpecte ſaue only of pure love to God and his neyboure / as he naturally eateth whē he is an hongred / without cōpulſiō & all other reſpecte / ſaue to ſlake his hongre only.
            ¶ And whē they come to the Goſpell / there they mīgle their leuen & ſaye / God now receaueth vs no moare to mercie / but of

mercie receaueth vs to penaunce / that is to wete / holy dedes yt make them fatt belies & vs their captiues / both in ſoule and body. And yet they fayne theyr Idole y• Pope ſo mercifull / yt if thou make a litle money gliſter in his Balams eyes / there is nether penaunce ner purgatory ner any faſtīge at all but to fle to heven as ſweſte as a thought and at the twinkellynge of an eye.
            ¶ And the liues ſtories and geſtes of men which are cōtayned in the bible / they reade as thīges no moare perteynīge vn to thē / then a take of Robī hode / & as thīges they wott not wherto they ferue / ſaue to fayne falſe diſcāt & tuglinge allegories / to ſtabliſh their kingdome with all. And one y• chefeſt & fleſhlieſt ſtudie they have / is to magnifie y• ſayntes aboue meaſure & aboue y• trueth & with their poetrie to make them greater then euer God make them. And if they fix de any infirmite or ſynne aſſcribed vn to y• ſaintes / that they excuſe with all diligēce / diminuſhīge the glorie of ye mercie of God & robbinge wretched ſinners of all theyr cō fo: te / & thinke therby to flater the ſayntes

and to obtayne their fauoure & to make ſpeciall aduocates of thē: even as a man wold obtayne y• fauoure of wordely tirantes: as they alſo fayne the ſaintes moch moare cruell then ever was any heathē man & moare wrekefull and vengeable then y• poetes faine their godes or their furies yt torment y• ſoules in hell / if theyr euēs be not faſted & their images vifited & ſaluted wyth a Pater noſter (whych prayer only oure lippes be accoynted with oure hertes vnderſtōdinge none at all) and worſheped wt a candell & y• offerīge of oure deuociō / in y• place which thei haue choſen to heare y• ſupplicaciōs & meke peticiōs of their clientes therin.
            ¶ But thou reader thīke of ye law of God how yt it is all together ſpirituall / & ſo ſpirituall yt it is neuer fulfilled wt dedes or werkes / vntill they flow out of thyne herte wt as greate loue toward thy neyboure / for no deleruīge of his ye though he be thine enimie / as Chriſt loued y• ād did for the / for no deſertīge of thyne / but evē whē thou waſt his enimie. And in ye meane time / thoroute all our infancie & childhod in Chriſt / tyll

                  •
               e growen vpp in to perfecte men in the full knowlege of chriſt & full loue of chriſt agayne & of oure neyboures for his ſake / after y• enſample of his loue to vs / remenbir that y• fulfillynge of y• law is / a faſtfayth in chriſtes bloud coupled wt our profeſſiō & ſubmyttīge ourſelues to lerne to doo better ¶ And of y• Goſpell or promiſes which thou meteſt in y• ſcripture / beleue faſt y• God will fulfill them vn to y• / and that vn to y• vttemoſt 
                  •
               ott / at the repentaunce of thyne herte / whē thou turneſt to hym & forſakeſt euell / even of his goodneſſe & fatherly mertie vn to the / ād not for thy flatterlge hym with ypocritiſh workes of thyne awne fayninge. So yt a faſt faith only with out reſpecte of all workes / is the forgeueneſſe both of the ſynne which we did in tyme of ignoraunce with luſte ād cōſent to ſynne / & alſo of all the ſynne which we doo by chaunce & of frailte / after yt we are come to knowlege ād have profeſſed y• law out of oure hertes. And all dedes ſerue only for to helpe oure neyboures & to tame oure fleſh that we fall not to ſynne agayne / & to exercice oure ſoules

in vertue / & not to make ſatiſfaction to God ward for ye ſynne yt is once paſte.
            ¶ And all other ſtories of ye bible / with out excepciō / are y• practiſinge of ye law & of the Goſpell / and are true and faitfull enſamples & ſure erneſte yt God will euen ſo deale with vs / as he did with thē / in all infirmities / in all temptaciōs / & in all like caſes & chaunces. Wherin ye ſe on ye one ſyde / how fatherly & tendirly & with all cōpaſſion god entreateth his electe which ſubmitte them ſelues as ſcolers / to lerne to walke in the wayes of his lawes / & to kepe thē of loue. If they forgatt thē ſelues at a time & wēt aſtraye / he ſought thē out & fett thē agayne with all mercie. If they fell & hurte thē ſelues / he healed thē agayne with all compaſſion & tenderneſſe of hert. He hath ofte brought greate tribulation & aduerſite vppon his electe: but all of fatherly loue onlye to teach thē & to make them ſe their awne hertes & ye ſinne yt there laye hid / that they might aftirwarde feale his mercie. For his mercie wayted vppon thē / to rid them out agayne / aſſone as they ware lerned & come

to y• knowlege of their awne hertes: ſo that he neuer caſt man awaye how depe ſo euer he had ſinned / ſaue thē ōly which had firſt caſt y• yocke of his lawes frō their neckes / with vtter diffiaunce & malice of herte. Which enſamples how cōfortable are they for vs / whē webe fallen in to ſinne & God is come vppō vs with a ſtorge / y• we diſpeare not / but repēt with full hope of mercie after y• enſamples of mercie yt are gone before? And therfore they were written for our lernīge / as teſtifieth Paul Ro. xv. to cōforte vs / y• we might y• better put oure hope & truſt in God / whē we ſe / how mercifull he hath bene in tymes paſt vn to our weake brethern y• are gone before / in all theyr aduerſities / neade / temptaciōs / ye & horrible ſynnes in to which they now & then fell.
            ¶ And on y• other ſide ye ſe how they y• hardened their hertes & ſynned of malice & refuſed mercie y• was offered thē & had no power to repēt / periſhed at y• later ende with all confuſion & ſhame mercileſſely. Which enſamples are very good & neceſſary / to kepe vs in awe & dreade in tyme of proſperite

as thou maiſt ſe by Paul. j. Cor. x. that we abyde in the feare of God / & way not wild and fall to vanities ād ſo ſynne ād prouoke God and bringe wrath vppon vs.
            ¶ And thridly ye ſe in that practiſe / how as god is mercifull & longeſoferynge / euen ſo were all his true prophetes & prechers / beringe the infirmities of their weake brethern & their awne wrōges & iniuries with all paciēce & longeſoferinge / neuer caſtinge any of thē of their backes / vn tyll they ſynned agenſt y• holygoſt / maliciouſly perſecutinge y• open & manifeſt trouch: cōtrary vnto the enſample of y• Pope / which in ſinninge agenſt God & to quench y• trueth of his holy ſpirite / is euer chefe captayne and trō
               petblower / to ſett other awerke / ād ſeketh only his awne fredome / liberte / priuilege / welth / proſperite / profite / pleaſure / paſtyme / honoure & glorie / with y• bondage / thraldome / captiuite / miſerie / wretchedneſſe & vile ſubiectiō of his brethern: & in his awne cauſe is ſo feruent / ſo ſteffe & cruell / that he will not ſofre one word ſpoken agenſt his falſe magiſte / wily inuenciōs ād iuglynge

ypocriſie to be vnaduēged / though all chriſtendome ſhuld be ſett to gether by the cares / and ſhuld coſt he cared not how many hundred thouſande their lives.
            
               
                  
                     •
                  
               Ow y• thou mayſt reade Jonas frute fully & not as a poetis fable / but as an obligacō betwene God and thy ſoule / as an erniſt peny geuen y• of God / yt he wil helpe y• in time of nede / if thou turne to him ād as the word of god y• only fode ād life of thy ſoule / this marke & note. Firſt count Jonas the frend of god ād a man choſen of god to teſtifie his name vnto y• worlde: but yet a younge ſcolar / weake & rude / after y• faciō of y• appoſtles / while Chriſt was yet with them bodyly. Which though Chriſt taught thē euer to be meke & to vmble thē ſelues / yet oft ſtroue amonge them ſelues who ſhuld be greateſt. The ſonnes of Zebede wold ſitt / the one on the right hōde of Chriſt ād the other on y• lifte. They wold praye / that fire might deſcēde from heuen / and conſume the Samaritanes.
            ¶ Whē Chriſt axed who ſaye men that I am / Peter anſwered / thou arte the ſonne

of the lyuinge God / as though Peter had bene as perfecte as an angell. But immediatly after / when Chriſt preached vnto thē of his deeth & paſſiō / Peter was angre & rebuked Chriſte & thought erneſtly yt he had raued & not wiſt what he ſayde: as at another time / when Chriſt was ſo feruētly buſied in healinge y• people / yt he had no leyſer to eate / they went out to holde him / ſuppoſinge that he had bene beſyde him ſelfe. Ande one yt caſt out deuels in Chriſtes name / they forbade / becauſe he wayted not on them / ſo glorious were they yet.
            ¶ And though chriſt taughte all waye to forgeue / yet peter after longe goenge to ſcole / axed wether men ſhuld forgeue. vij. tymes / thynkinge yt. viij. tymes had bene to moch. And at y• laſt ſoper Peter wold have died with chriſte / but yet within fewe howres after / he denied hym / both cowardly & ſhamefully. And after y• ſame maner / though he had ſo lōge herd that nomā might auenge him ſelfe / but rather turne y• other cheke to / then to ſinyte agayne / yet when Chriſt was in takīge / peter axed whether

it were lawfull to ſmyte with y• ſwerde / ād taried none anſwere / but layed on raſhly. So that though when we come firſt vnto y• knowlege of the trueth / and the peace is made betwene God & vs / & we loue his lawes & beleue & truſt in hym / as in oure father & haue good hertes vnto him & be born anew in y• ſprite: yet we are but childern ād younge ſcolars weake & foble & muſt have leyſar to grow in y• ſpirite / in knowlege / loue & in y• dedes therof / as younge childern muſt have tyme to grow in their bodies.
            ¶ And God oure father & ſeolemaſter fedeth vs & teached vs accordinge vnto the capacite of oure ſtomakes / & maketh vs to grow & waxe perfecte / & fineth vs & trieth vs as gold / in y• fire of temptaciōs & tribulations. As Moſes wittneſeth Deutero. viij. ſayēge: Remēber all y• waye by which y• lord thy God caried y• this. xl. yeres in y• wilderneſſe / to vmble the & to tēpte or proue the / y• it might be knowen what were in thine hert. He brougt the in to aduerſite & made y• an hongred / & then feed y• with mā which nether thou ner yet thi fathers euer

knew of / to teach y• that a mā liueth no thy bred only / but by all that proceadeth out of the mouth of God. For y• promiſes of god are life vnto all y• cleaue vnto thē / moch moare thē is bred & bodyly ſuſtinaunce: a

            ¶ God therfore to teach Jonas & to ſhew him his awne hert & to make him perfecte & to enſtructe vs alſo bi his enſample / ſen
                  •
                him out of y• lande of Iſrael where he was a prophete / to goo amonge y• heathē people & to y• greateſt & mightieſt citie of y• world thē / called Niniue: to preache yt within. xl. dayes they ſhuld all periſh for their ſinnes & that y• citie ſhuld be ouerthrowē. Which meſſage y• frewil of Jonas had as moch power to doo / as the weakeſt herted womāin the world hath power / if ſhe were cōmaun

ded / to leppe in to a tobbe of lyuinge ſnakes & edders: as happely if God had cōmaunded Sara to haue ſacrificed hir ſonne Iſaac / as he did Abrahā / ſhe wold haue diſputed with hī yer ſhe had done it / or though ſhe were ſirōge ynough / yet many an holy ſeint coud not haue ſound in their hertes / but wold haue diſobeyed ād haue runne awaye frō y• preſens of yt cōmaūdemēt of god wt Jonas if thei had bene ſo ſirōgly tēpted.
            ¶ For Jonas thought of this maner: loo / I am here a prophete vnto Gods people the Iſraelites. Which though they haue gods word teſtified vnto them dayly / yet diſpite it & worſhepe God vnder y• likeneſſe of calues & after all maner facions ſaue after his awne worde / & therfore are of all naciōs y• worſt & moſt worthy of puniſhment. And yet god for loue of few yt are amonge them & for his names ſake ſpareth them & defer
                  •
                deth them. How thē ſhuld god take ſo cruell vengeaunce on ſo greate a multitude of them to whome his name was neuer preached to ād therfore are not y• tenth parte ſo euel as theſe? If I ſhal therfore goo preach

ſo ſhall I lye & ſhame my ſelfe & God the to and make them the moare to diſpice god and ſett the leſſe by him ād to be the moar
                  •
                cruell vn to his people.
            ¶ And vppon that imaginaciō he fled frō the face or preſens of God: that is / out of y• contre where God was worſheped in & frō proſecutynge of Gods cōmaundemēt / and thought / I wyll gett me a nother waye amonge y• hethen people & be no moare a prophete / but lyue at reſt & out of all cōbraunce. Neuer y• leſſe the god of all mercie which careth for his electe childern & turneth al
                  •
                vn to good to them & ſmiteth thē to heale them agayne & killeth thē to make thē al
                  •
               
               ue agayne / & playeth with thē (as a father doth ſome tyme with his yoūge ignoraunt childern) & tempteth them & proueth them to make them ſe theyr awne hertes / prouided for onas / how all thinge ſhuld be.
            ¶ When Jonas was entered in to the ſheppe / he layed him downe to ſlepe ād to take his reſt: that is / his cōſcience was toſſed betwene the cōmaudemēt of God which ſent him to Niniue / & his fleſhly wiſdome that

diſſuaded & counſeled hym ye cōtrary & at ye laſt preualed agēſt ye cōmaundemēt & caried hym a nother waye / as a ſheppe caught betwene. ij. ſtreames / & as poetes faine the mother of Meliager to be betwene diuers affecciōs / while to aduēge hir brothers deeth / ſhe ſought to ſle hir awne ſonne. Where vppon for very payne & tediouſneſſe / he laye downe to ſlepe / for to put ye cōmaundement which ſo gnew & freate his cōſcience / out of minde / as y• nature of all weked is / whē they haue ſinned a good / to ſeke al meanes with riot / reuell & paſtyme / to driue ye remenbraunce of ſynne out of their thoughtes or as Adā did / to couer their nakedneſſe with aporns of pope holy workes▪ But God awoke hym out of his dreame / and ſett his ſynnes before his face.
            ¶ For when y• Lott had caught Jonas / thē be ſure yt his ſynnes came to remēbraunce agayne & that his conſcience raged no leſſe thē ye waues of the ſe. And thē he thought that he only was a ſinner & ye hethen that ware in ye ſhepp none in reſpecte of him / 
                  •
               o thought alſo / as veryly as he was fled frō
               
god / that as verily god had caſt hi awaye▪ for y• ſight of y• rod mal eth y• natural child not ōly to ſe & to knowlege his faulte / but alſo to forgett all his fathers olde mercie & kindneſſe. And then he cōfeſſed his ſynne openly & had yet ſeuer periſh alone thē y• y• other ſhuld haue periſhed with him for his ſake: and ſo of very deſperacion to haue liued any lenger / bad caſt him in to y• ſee betymes / excepte they wold be loſt alſo.
            ¶ To ſpeake of lottes / how ferforth they are lawfull / is a light queſtiō. Firſt to vſe thē for the breakinge of ſtrife / as when partenars / their goodes as equally diuided as they cā / take euery mā his parte by lott / to avoyde all ſuſpiciō of diſceytfulneſſe: & as y• appoſtles in y• firſt of y• Actes / whē they ſought a nother to ſuccede Iudas the traytoure / &. ij. perſones were preſentes / thē to breake ſtrife & to ſatiſfie al parties / did caſt lott
                  •

               eper thē & to take whō he knew moſt mete / ſeynge they wiſt not wheter to preferre / or haply coude not all agre on ether / is lawfull ad in all like caſes. But to

abuſe them vn to y• tempiinge of God & to cōpell him therwith to vtter thinges wherof we ſtōd in doute / when we haue no commaundemēt of him ſo to do / as theſe hethē here dyd / though God turned it vn to his glorie / can not be but euell.
            ¶ The hethen ſ
                  •
               epinē aſſtonied at y• ſight of y• miracle / feared God / prayed to him / offered ſacrifice & vowed vowes. And I doute not / but that ſome of thē or haply all came therby vn to the true knowlege & true worſhepinge of God & ware wōne to God in theyr ſoules. And thꝰ God which is infinite mercifull in all his wayes / wrought their ſoules health out of y• infirmite of Ionas / euen of his good will & purpoſe & loue wherewith he loued them before the world was made / & not of chaunce / as it appereth vn to the eyes of the ignoraunt.
            ¶ And that Jonas was .iij. dayes & .iij. nightes in the bely of his fiſh: we cā not ther by proue vn to te Iewes & īfideles or vn to any man / y• Chriſt muſt therfore dye ād be buried & riſe agayne. But we vſe y• enſample ād likeneſſe to ſtrength the ſaith of the

weake. For he that beleaueth the one cannot doute in y• other: in as moch as the hād of God was no leſſe mightie in preſeruige Jonas aliue agenſt all naturall poſſibilite & in deliuerynge hi ſafe out of his fiſh / thē in reyſynge vpp Chriſt agayne out of his ſepulchre. And wemaye deſcribe y• power & vertue of y• reſurrecciō therby / ac Chriſt hī ſelfe boroweth y• ſimilitud̄e therto Mat. xij. ſayēge vn to y• Jewes that came aboute him & deſyred a ſigne or a wōder frō heuen to certifye thē that he was chriſt: this euell & wed lockebreakīge naciō (which breake y• wedlocke of faith wherwith they be▪ maried vn to God / ād beleue in their falſe workes) ſeke a ſigne / but there ſhal no ſigne be geuen thē ſaue ye ſigne of the Prophete Jonas. For as Jonas was. iij. dayes ād iij. nightes in the bely of the whale / euē ſo ſhall the ſonne of man be. iij. dayes &. iij. nyghtes in the herte of the erth. Which was a watch word / as we ſaye / & a ſharpe threateninge vn to y• Jewes & as moch to ſaye as thus / ye harde herted Jewes ſeke a ſigne: loo / thys ſhalbe youre ſygne / as Jonas

was reyſed out of the ſepulchre of his fiſhe & then ſent vn to the Niniuites to preach y• they ſhuld periſh / euen ſo ſhall I ryſe agayne out of my ſepulchre & come & preach repentaunce vn to you. Se therfore when ye ſe y• ſigne that ye repēt or elſe ye ſha

For though the infirmities which ye now ſe i my fleſh be a lett vn to youre faythes / ye ſhall yet then be with out excuſe / when ye ſe ſo greate a miracle & ſo greate power of god ſhed out vppō you. And ſo Chriſte came agayne after y• reſurrecciō / in his ſpirite & preached repētaunce vn to them / by the mouth of his appoſtles & diſciples / & with miracles of y• holy goſt. And all that repented not periſhed ſhortly after ād were for y• moſt parte ſlayne with ſwerde ād y• reſt caried awaye captiue in to all quarters of the world for an enſample / as ye ſe vn to this daye.
            ¶ And in lyke maner ſens the world beganne / where ſoeuer repentaunce was offered and not receaued / there God toke cruell vengeaunce immiediatly: as ye ſe in y•

            ¶ Wicleffe preached repētaunce vn to oure fathers not longe ſens: they repēted not for their hertes were indurat & theyr eyes blinded with their awne Pope holy rightweſneſſe wherwith they had made theyr ſoules gaye agenſt the receauinge agayn
                  •
                of y• woked ſpirite that bringeth. vij. worſe then hym ſelfe with him & maketh y• late 
                  •
                ende worſe then the beginninge: for in open ſinnes there is hope of repentaunce / but in holy ypocriſie none at all. But what folowed? they ſlew their true & right kinge ād

ſett vpp▪ iij. wrōge kīges arow / vnder which all the noble bloud was ſlayne vpp ād halfe the coniēs therto / what in fraunce & what with their awne ſwerde / in fightīge amonge thē ſelues for y• crowne / & y• cities and townes decayed and the land brought halfe in to a wylderneſſe in reſpecte of that it was before.
            ¶ And now Chriſt to preach repētaunce / is reſen yet ōce agayne out of his ſepulchre in which the pope had buried him and kepte him downe with his pilars and polaxes and all diſgyſinges of ypocriſie / with gyle / wifes and falſhed / ād with the ſwerd of al princes which he had blynded with his falſe marchaundice. And as I dowte not of y• enſamples that are paſt / ſo am I ſure that greate wrath will folow / excepte repētaunce turne it Backe agayne and ceaſe it.
            ¶ When Jonas had bene in te fiſhes bely a ſpace & the rage of his conſcience was ſomewhat quieted ād ſwaged and he come to him ſelfe agayne and had receaued a lytle hope / the qualmes & panges of deſperaciō which went ouer hys hert / halfe ouercome

he prayed / as he maketh menciōin the texte ſayēge: Jonas prayed vn to the lord his god out of the bely of the fiſhe. But the wordes of that prayer are not here ſett. The prayer y• here ſtonde th in the texte / is the prayer of prayſe & thākeſgeuēge which he prayed and wrote when he was eſcaped and paſt all ieopardie.
            ¶ In the end of which prayer he ſayth / I will ſacrifice with the voyce of thankeſgeuenge and paye that I haue vowed / that ſauinge cometh of the lorde. For verely to cōfeſſe out of the herte / that all benefites come of God / euen out of the goodneſſe of his mercie and not deſeruinge of oure dedes / is the only ſacrifice that pleaſeth God. And to beleue that god only is the ſauer / is the thynge that all the Jewes vowed in theyr circumciſion / as we in oure baptim. Which vowe Jonas now tawght with experiēce / promiſeth to paye. For thoſe outwarde ſacrifices of beſtes / vn to which Jonas had haply aſſcribed to moch before / were but feble & childiſh thinges & not ordeyned / that the workes of thē ſelues ſhuld be a ſeruice

vnto god / but vn to the people / to put thē in remembraunce of this inwarde ſacrifice of thankes & of faith to truſt and beleue in God the only ſauer. Which ſignificacion when was awaye / they were abhominable and deuellyſh ydolatrye and imageſeruice: as oure ceremonies and ſacramentes are become now to all that truſt & beleue in the werke of them and ar not taught the ſignificacions / to edifye theyr ſoules with knowlege and the doctrine of God.
            ¶ When Jonas was caſt vppō lond agayne / then his will was fre ād had power to goo whother God ſent him & to doo what God bade / his awne imaginacions layed a parte. For he had bene at a new ſcole / ye ād in a fornace where he was purged of moch refuſe & droſhe of fleſhly wiſdome / which reſiſted y• wiſdome of god & led Jonaſes wil cōtrary vn to y• will of god. For as ferre as we be blynd in Adam / we can not but ſeke & will oure awne profitt / pleaſure & glorie. And as ferre as we be taughte in the ſprite / we can not but ſeke & wyll the pleaſure and glorie of God only.
            
               ¶ And as for the. iij. dayes iourney of Niniue / whether it were in length or to goo rounde aboute it or thorow all the ſtretes / I cō
               mitte vn to the diſcreciō of other men. But I thinke that it was then the greateſt citie of the world.
            ¶ And that Jonas wēt a dayes iourney in the citie / I ſuppoſe he did it not in one daye: but wēt fayre & eaſyly preachīge here a ſermon & there a nother & rebuked the ſynne of the people for which they muſt periſhe.
            ¶ And when thou art come vn to the repē
               taunce of the Niniuites / there haſt thou ſure erneſt / that how ſoeuer angre god be / yet he remembreth mercie vn to all that truly repent and beleue in mercie. Which enſample oure ſauioure Chriſt alſo caſteth in the teeth of the indurat Jewes ſayenge: the Niniuites ſhall riſe in iudgemēt with this nacion and condemne them / for they repented at the preachynge of Jonas / and beholde a greater thē Jonas here / meanynge of hym ſelfe. At whoſe preachinge yet / though it were neuer ſo mightie to perce the herte / & for all his miracles therto / the hard herted

Jewes coude not repent: when the heathen Niniuites repented at the bare preachynge of Jonas rebukinge theyr ſynnes with out any miracle at all.
            ¶ Why? For y• Jewes had leuēded the ſpirituall law of God and with theyr gloſes had made it all to gether erthie ād fleſhly / and ſo had ſett a vayle or coueringe on Moſes face / to ſhodowe and darken y• glorious brightneſſe of his contenaunce. It was ſynne to ſtele: but to robbe wedowes howſes vnder a coloure of longe prayēge / & to polle in the name of offeringes / and to ſnare y• people with intollerable cōſtitucions agēſt all loue / to ketch theyr money out of theyr purſes / was no ſynne at all.
            ¶ To ſmyte father ād mother was ſynn: But to withdraw helpe frō them at theyr nede / for blynde zele of offeringe / vn to the profytt of the holy phareſes / was then as meritorious as it is now to let all thy kynne choſe wheter they will ſynke or ſweme / while thou byldeſt and makeſt goodly fundaciōs for holy people which thou haſt choſen to be thy chriſte / for to ſowple thy ſoule

with the oyle of theyr ſwete bleſſynges / & to be thy Jeſus for to ſaue thy ſoule from y• purgatory of the bloud that only purgeth ſynne / with theyr watchīge / faſtīge / wolward goinge & ryſynge at mydnyght etc. where wyth yet they purge not them ſelues from theyr couetouſneſſe / pryde / lechury or any vyce that thou ſeyſt amonge the laye people.
            ¶ It was greate ſynne for Chriſt to heale the people on the ſabboth daye vn to the glorie of God hys father / but none at all for them to helpe theyr catell vnto theyr awne profett.
            ¶ It was ſynne to eate wyth vnwaſhen handes or on an vnwaſhen table / or out of an vnwaſhen diſh: but to eate out of that purifyed dyſh that which came of brybery / theft & extorſion / was no ſynne at all.
            ¶ It was exceadynge meritorious to make many dyſcyples: But to teach them to feare God in hys ordynaunces / had they no care at all.
            ¶ The hye prelates ſo defended the ryght of holy church ād ſo feared the people with

the curſe of God & terreble paynes of hell / that no man durſt leaue the vileſt herke in hys gardeyne vntythed. And the offerynge and thynges dedycat vn to God for the profitt of hys holy vycars where in ſoch eſtymacion and reuerēce / that it was moch greater ſynne to ſweare truly by them / thē to for ſwere thy ſelfe by God: what vengeaunce then of God / and how terreble and cruell damnacion thynke ye preached they to fall on thē that had ſtolen ſoch holy thī
               ges? And yet ſayth Chriſt / that ryghtweſneſſe ād faith in kepynge promiſe / mercie and indyfferent iudgement were vtturly troden vnder fote and cleane diſpyſed of thoſe bleſſed fathers / whych ſo mightely mayntened Arons patrimony ād had mad it ſo proſperous ād enuironed it and walled it aboute on euery ſyde with y• feare of god / that noman durſt twech it.
            ¶ It was greate holyneſſe to garnyſh y• ſe pulchres of y• prophetes & to cōdemne their awne fathers for ſleynge of them: and yet were they thē ſelues for blinde zele of their owne cōſtituciōs / as ready as their fathers

to ſle whoſoeuer teſtified vn to them / the ſame trueth which the prophetes teſtified vn to theyr fathers. So that Chriſt cōpareth all the rightweſneſſe of thoſe holy patriarkes vn to the out warde bewtye of a paynted ſepulchre full of ſtench and all vnclenneſſe wythyn.
            ¶ And finally to begyld a mans neyboure in ſotle bargeninge and to wrappe and cō
               paſe him in with cauteles of the law / was then as it is now in the kingdome of y• Pope. By the reaſon where of they excluded the law of loue out of theyr hertes / ād cōſe quētly all true repentaunce: for how coude they repēt of y• they coude not ſe to be ſinne?
            ¶ And on the other ſyde they had ſett vpp a rightweſneſſe of holy workes / to clenſe theyr ſoules with all: as the Pope ſanctifieth vs with holy oyle / holy bred / holy ſalt / holy candels / holy dome ceremonies ād holy dome bleſſynges / and with what ſoever holyneſſe thou wilt ſaue with the holynes of▪ Gods worde which only ſpeaketh vn to the herte and ſheweth the ſoule hir fi

               ſe and vnclenneſſe of ſynne / and leadeth

hir by y• waye of repentaunce vn to y• fountayne of Chriſtes bloude to waſhe it awaye thorow faith. By the reaſon of which falſe rightweſneſſe they were dyſobedient vn to the rightweſneſſe of God / which is the forgeueneſſe of ſynne in Chriſtes bloude and coude not beleue it. And ſo thorow fleſhly interpretynge the law ād falſe imagined rightweſneſſe / their hertes were hardened ād made as ſtony as clay in an hote ſurnace of fire / that they coude receaue nether repentaunce ner faith or any moyſter of grace at all.
            ¶ But the hethen Niniuites / though they were blynded with luſtes a good / yet were in thoſe. ij. poyntes vncorrupte and vnhardened / & therfore with the only preachinge of Jonas came vn to the knowlege of their ſynnes and confeſſed them & repented truly & turned euery man from his euelldedes & declared theyr ſorow of hert & true repentaunce / with theyr dedes which they dyd out of faith & hope of forgeueneſſe / chaſtyſinge their bodies with prayer & faſtinge & with takinge all pleaſures from the fleſh:

truſtynge / as god was angre for their wer kedneſſe / even ſo ſhuld he forgeue them o
                  •
                hys mercye / yf they repēted & forſoke their myſſe fyuinge.
            ¶ And in the laſt ende of all / thou haſt yet a goodly enſample of lernynge / to ſe how erth ye Jonas is ſtyll for all hys tryenge in the whales bely. He was ſo ſore diſpleaſed becauſe the Niniuites periſhed not / that he was wery of hys lyfe and wiſhed after the deeth for very ſorow & payne / that he had looſt the glorie of his propheſienge / in that his propheſie come not to paſſe. But god rebuked him with a likeneſſe ſayenge: it greueth thyne hert for the loſſe of a vile ſhrob be or ſpraye / wheron thou beſtoweddeſt no loboure or coſt / nether was it thyne handwerke. How moch moare then ſhuld greue myne herte / the loſſe of ſo greate a multitude of innocētes as are in Niniue / which are all myne handes werke. Nay Jonas / Jam God ouer all / and father as well vn to the hethen as vn to the Jewes ād mercifull to all and warne yer I ſmyte: nether threte I ſo cruelly by any prophete / but that I wyll

forgeue yf they repent ād ax mercie: nether on the other ſyde / what ſoeuer I promyſe / wyll I fulfyll it / ſaue for theyr ſakes only whych truſt in me and ſubmitte them ſelues to kepe my lawes of very loue / as naturall chyldern.
            
               ON thys maner to read y• ſcripture is y• right vſe therof & why y• holy goſt cauſed it to be writtē. That is yt thou firſt ſeke out y• law / what god will haue the to doo / interpretinge it ſpiritually with cut gloſe or coueringe the brightneſſe of Moſes face / ſo yt thou fele in thyne hert / how that it is damnable ſynne before god / not to loue they neyboure that is thyne enimie / as puerly as Chriſt loued the / and y• not to loue thy neyboure in thyne herte / is to haue cōmitted all ready all ſynne agenſt him. And therfore vn tyll that loue become / thou muſt knowlege vnfaynedly that there is ſynne in the beſt dede thou doeſt. And it muſt erneſtly greue thyne hert and thou muſt waſhe all thy good dedes in chriſtes bloude / yet they can be pure and an acceptable ſacrifice vn to God / and muſt desire

god y• father for his ſake / to take thi dedes a worth & to pardō y• imperfecteneſſe of them / & to geue the power to doo thē better and with moare feruent loue.
            ¶ And on the other ſyde thou muſt ſerch diligently for the promiſes of mercie which God hath promiſed the agayne. Which. ij. poyntes / that is to wete / y• lawe ſpiritually interpreted / how that all is dānable ſynne that is not vnfayned loue out of the grownde and botom of the herte after the enſample of Chriſtes loue to vs / becauſe we be all equally created ād formed of one god oure father / and indifferently bought & redemed with one bloud of oure ſauioure Jeſus Chriſte: ād that the promiſes be geuen vn to a repentynge ſoule that thurſteth and longeth after them / of the pure and fatherly mercie of god thorow oure faith onely with oute al deſeruinge of oure dedes or merites of oure werkes / but for Chriſtes ſake alone and for the merites ād deſeruinges of his werkes / deth and paſſions that he ſofered all together for vs & not for himſelfe: whych. ij. poyntes I ſaye / if they be

written in thine herte / are the keyes which ſo open all the ſcripture vn to the / that no creature can locke the out / and with which thou ſhalt goo in and out / and finde paſture and fode euery where. And yf theſe leſons be not writtten in thyne herte / then is all the ſcripture ſhutt vpp / as a cornell in the ſhale / ſo that thou mayſt read it and comen of it and reherſe all the ſtories of it and diſpute ſotilly and be a profounde ſophiſter / and yet vnderſtond not one Iot therof.
            ¶ And thridly that thou take the ſtories & liues which are cōteyned in the bible / for ſure ād vndowted enſamples / yt God ſo will deale with vs vn to the worldes ende.
            ¶ Here with Reader farewell and be commended vn to God / and vn to the grace of hys ſpryte. And firſt ſe that thou ſtoppe not thyne eares vn to the callynge of god / and that thou harden not thine herte begyled with fleſhly interpretinge of the law & falſe imagined and ypocritiſh rightweſneſſe / and ſo the Niniuites ryſe with the at ye day of iudgement & condemne the.
            
               ¶ And ſecōdarily if thou finde ought amiſſe / when thou ſeyſt thy ſelfe in the glaſſe of Gods worde / thynke it cōpendious wiſdome / to amende y• ſame betymes / moneſhed & warned by the enſample of other men / rather thē to tary vntill thou be beten alſo.
            ¶ And thridly if it ſhall ſo chaunce / that y• wild luſtes of thy fleſh ſhall blynd the and carie the cleane awaye with them for a tyme: yet at the later ende / when y• god of all mercie ſhall haue compaſed the in on euery ſyde with tēptaciōs / tribulacions / aduerſities & cōbraunce / to bringe y• home agayne vn to thyne awne herte / & to ſet thy ſinnes wich thou woldeſt ſo fayne couer & put out of mynd with delectaciō of voluptuous paſtymes / before y• eyes of thy cōſcience: then call y• faithfull enſample of Jonas & all lylie ſtories vn to thy remēbraunce / ād with Jonas turne vn to thi father that ſmote y•: not to caſt y• awaye / but to laye a coroſie ād a

            ¶ And forget not yt what ſoeuer enſample of mercie god hath ſhewed ſens y• beginninge of y• world / the ſame is promiſed the / yf thou wilt in like maner turne agayne and receaued it as they dyd. And with Jonas be a knowen of thy ſynne & cōfeſſe it & knowlege it vn to thy father.
            ¶ And as y• law which freteth thy cōſcience / is in thyne herte & is none outwarde thige / evē ſo ſeke within in thine herte / ye playſter of mercie / the promyſes of forgeueneſſe in oure ſauioure Jeſus Chriſte / accordinge vn to all the enſamples of mercie that are gonne before.

For in thyne hert is the worde of y• law / & in thyne hert is y• worde of fayth in the promiſes of mercie in Jeſus Chriſte. So that yf thou cōfeſſe with a repentynge herte & knowlege ād ſurely beleue yt Jeſus is lorde ouer all ſynne / thou art ſaffe.

               ¶ And Jonas made hi ready to fle to Tharſis frō the preſens of y• lorde / & gatt hym downe to Joppe / and founde there a ſheppe ready to goo to Tharſis / & payed his fare / & wēt aborde / to goo with them to Tharſis frō the preſens of the lorde.
               ¶ But y• lorde hurled a greate winde in to y• ſe / ſo that there was a myghtie tēpeſt in theſe: in ſo moch yt the ſhepp was lyke to goo in peces. And the mariners were afrayed & cried euery man vn to his god / & caſt out y• goodes yt were in ye ſheppe in to y• ſe / to lighten it of thē. But Jonas gatt him vnder the hatches & layed him downe and

               ¶ And he ſayde: in my tribulacion I called vn to the lorde / and he anſwered me: out of the bely of hell I cried / ād thou herdeſt my voyce. For thou hadeſt caſt me downe depe in the middes of the ſe: & the floud cōpaſed me aboute: and all thy waues & rowles of water wēt ouer me: & I thought y• I had be ne caſt awaye out of thy ſight. But I will yet agayne loke towarde thy holy temple.

The water cōpaſed me euē vn to the very ſoule of me: the depe laye aboute me: ād the wedes were wrappte aboude myne heed. And I wēt downe vn to the botome of the hylles / & was barred in with erth on euery ſyde for euer. And yet thou lorde my God broughteſt vp my life agayne out of corrupcion. When my ſoule faynted in me / I thought on the lorde: & my prayer came in vn to the / even in to thy holy temple. They yt obſerue vayne vanities / haue forſakē him that was mercifull vn to them. But I wil ſacrifice vn to the with the voce of thankeſgeuinge / & will paye that I have vowed / that ſauinge cometh of the lorde.
               ¶ And the lorde ſpake vn to the fiſh: and it caſt out Ionas agayne vppon ye drie lande.

And when god ſaw theyr workes / how they turned from theyr weked wayes / he repented on ye euell

And therfore I haſted rather to fle to Tharſis: for I knew well ynough that thou waſt a mercifull god / ful of cōpaſſion / long yer thou be angre and of greate mercie and repenteſt when thou art come to take puniſhment. Now therfore take my life from me / for I had leuer dye then liue. And the lorde ſaid vn to Ionas / art thou ſo angrie?

And the lorde ſayde / thou haſt compaſſion on a wild vine / wheron thou beſtoweddeſt no laboure ner madeſt it growe / which ſprange vp in one night and periſhed in another: and ſhuld not I haue compaſſion on Niniue that greate citie / wherin there is a multitude of people / euen aboue an hundred thouſande that know not theyr right hand from the lyfte / beſydes moch catell?
