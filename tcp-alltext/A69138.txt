                  Afterwardes / clerkes layeng their hādes vpon me / I came to the pope hym ſelfe / and there renouncynge the pompes of the deuyll and his workes / & all ydols made with mannes hande: I confeſſed of myne owne free wyll / in preſence of all the people / that I beleue in one god father almightye / maker of heuyn and of erthe / of all a viſyble and inuyſyble thynges.

Than after that he had halowed the fonte or lauacre of baptyme / with his holy bleſſyng / he purifyed the water whiche was therin to putte. In to the which foūtayne or baptiſtory ſo ſone as I was ſette / I ſawe with my owne eyes a hande touchynge me from heuyn / by which hande (whan I roſe vp) I parceyued and knewe my ſelfe to be clēſed and purifyed from all the fowlneſſe and vnciēneſſe of leprie. And whan they had taken me out of that holy bathe / they dyd putte on me whyte garmentes. and he gaue me the carecte or marke of ye ſeuenfolde grace of the holy ghoſt / by a noyncyng me with holy oyle, & he marked the ſygne & token of the holy croſſe in my forhed / ſayng theſe wordes: God ſealeth or marketh the with ye ſeale of his fayth / in the name of the father and of the ſonne / & of the holyghoſt / and all the clergy anſwered / and ſayd.

And I verily of my parte / albeit that I was afore ꝑſwaded & in full belefe / if it ſhuld fortune & chaūce you to haue this moſt high auctorite & gouernaunce ouer all / for aſmoch as you haue alwayes / ſo and in ſuche wyſe loued & exerciſed the ſtudies of beſt letters / that your profyting and goyng forwarde in thē / may with out dout be cōpared with the doctryne of the beſt lerned men that be in this tyme / that you wolde nat ſuffre any of the monumētes or workes made by aūcient authors in olde tyme to periſſhe / & to be vtterly loſt & caſt away whiles you were pope / yet natwithſtāding whan I red that inſcriptyon or tytle openly ſet forthe in Italy.

                        Peace was thynheritāce which Chriſt gaue & left to his apoſtles.

                      And therfore alſo they were nat his vycars / whoſe ſted & offyce they dyd nat kepe or fulfyll / for they kyngdome of god is to kepe peace / but rather they were clene contrary & enemies to Chriſt / whoſe ſtudies or workes they haue diſpyſed / and haue folowed a contrary kynde or maner of lyuing / for peace belōgeth to him: and they deſyred & folowed warres and batayls. He ſtudyed to ſaue men by his doctryne and teachyng / and they laboured buſely to kyll and deſtroye men / with weapons of warre. He ſhewed his kyngdome to be heuenly / and they fyrſt of al / and moſt chefely ſought the empiers of the worlde. Therfore neither they were bleſſed: bycauſe they were nat peaceable or maynteners of peace. Neither were they the ſonnes of god / for Chriſt ſayth. Bleſſed are the peceable perſons:Mat. v. for they ſhall be called the ſonnes of god. ❀ Lo / thā by you moſt bleſſed father is reſtored and renewed the peace / which through their peruerſyte was ſayd to haue had a great fall & decaye.

But in Coſmus this was principally worthy meruayle and prayſe / that he beyng him ſelfe nat lerned / yet dyd he loue lerned men & had them in honour / cauſing them to beſought forth and brought to him from all places on euery ſide / and ſocouryng them with his helpe / and alſo with his goodes.

Neither is it the dignyte of any man / that may him ſafe and ſure frome blame or rebukes / whiche dyd nat ſaue Peter frome reprefe / nor many other men of the ſame highe eſtate and degree: but that they haue ben rebuked / as Marcellus / bicauſe he had made ſacrifyce to goddes and Celeſtine / bycauſe he was of the ſame opinion: that Neſtorius ye heretyke was of / & as we do knowe alſo / that in our tyme & remembraūce / certayne haue ben of their inferiours. (For who is nat inferiour to the pope) repreued and rebuked (I wyl nat ſay condempned) And verely I doo nat this / For what entēte valla made this worke. bycauſe I do coueyte to rayle vpon any man / and to write ſuche reuilyng & rebukefull orations agaynſt him / as were the oratyons of Cicero / agaynſt maiſter Antonius / whiche orations are called philyppice (for god ſheld me from doīg ſuche a dede) but that I myght looſe & plucke a way erroures & wronge opinions frō mēnes myndes. and that I myght kepe thē farre away from vyces & ſīnes / either by admoniſſhīg & counſaylyng: or els by reprouīg & rebukīg of them.

although he be the pope hym ſelfe / what ſhall I ſaye that he is? Shall I ſay that he is a good ſhepherde? or elles rather a deafe ſerpent / which wyl nat heare ye voyce of the charmer or inchaunter / Pſal. 57. but is wyllyng to hurte his membres with her bytyng and poyſone.
I knowe that ye mennes eares haue ben nowe a good whyle deſyrouſe and longyng to here / what faute or cryme I wyll lay to ye popes charge / for ſothe a great and a huge cryme / either of neglygent ignoraunce / or elles of outragyouſe couetouſneſſe / whiche is the ſeruitute of ydoles / or elles of vanyte / and deſyre of hauyng dominion and rule / whiche vyce / Ephe. 5. tiranny alwayes accompanyeth / for now certayn hūdreth yeres either they haue perceyued and vnderſtande / that the donation or graunte of Conſtantyne is but a forged or fayned thyng / or elles thēſelues haue fayned it / or els thoſe that haue comen after / ſettyng their fete faſt in the gyles of their predeceſſours / haue defended it for trewe / whiche they knewe well was falſe / dyſhonoringe the maieſtie of the papall eſtate / diſworſhippynge the memorie of the olde popes / ſhamynge the chriſten relygion / and troublyng and fyllyng all the worlde with murthers / threttes / and abhomynable ſynnes. ❀ They ſay that the cytie of Rome is theirs that the kyngdome of Nables is their owne good. And that all Italy / Fraunce / Spayne / Germanye / Englande / and all the weſt parte of the worlde / belongeth to them ſelues. For all theſe nations & countreis (they ſay) are contayned in the inſtrument and writte of the donation or graunt. Are than / all theſe afore reherſed kyngdomes / thyne highe byſſhoppe? Is it thy mynde? & arte thou purpoſed to recouer all theſe agayn? to ſpoyle & bereue all the kynges & princes of the weſt ꝑte / their cyties & townes? or to cōpell them to pay yerely trybutes to the? But I do ſay & thynke clene cōtrary / that ye kynges may more rightfully ſpoyle & depriue the of all thempire & dominion that thou haſt. For as I ſhall declare & open / yu that graunt or gyfte / wherof the popes wyll their right & tytell to haue taken his origynall / was knowen both

to Sylueſter and alſo to Conſtantyne.Neither Conſtantyne neyther Syluerſter knewe euer any thīge at ſuch donation. But are euer I do come to the confutyng and diſprouyng of the inſtrument or writte of the ſayde donation (whiche is their onely defence / but bothe a falſe defence and a folyſſhe) the order requyreth that I reherce the matter ſomwhat farther of / and nere from the very begynnīg  And fyrſt of all I wyll ſhewe / that Conſtantyne and Sylueſter were no ſuche maner men / The order of his proceſſe in this oratiō & the deuiſyon of his worke. that either the one (I meane Cōſtantyne) wolde be wyllyng to gyue or els might rightfully gyue / or els that it dyd lye in his owne power / to delyuer them in to the handes of any other men / or els that the other (that is to wyt Sylueſter) wolde be wyllyng to receyue / or els miȝt laufully receyue and take them. Secondarily I wyl  ſhewe / that albeit theſe thynges were nat ſo / whiche are moſt trewe and euydent. yet that neither Sylueſter dyd receyue / neither Conſtātyne dyd delyuer poſſeſſyon of thoſe thynges / whiche are ſayd to haue ben gyuen / but that thoſe thynges haue alwayes cōtynewed and remayned in the hādes and gouernaunce or rule of the emperours. Thirdly / that nothyng at all  was gyuen of Conſtantyne to Sylueſter / but to the pope that was nexte predeceſſoure to Sylueſter / for Conſtātyne was baptyſed afore that Sylueſter was pope. And that thoſe gyftes were but ſmall or meane gyftes / wherwith the pope might ſuſtayne his lyfe. Fourthly I wyll ſhewe / that it is falſely & vntrewly  ſayd / that the copy of the donation or graunt / is eyther founde in the decrees / or els that it is taken of the hiſtorie and lyfe of ſaint Sylueſter: which neither is founde in that hiſtorie / neither yet in any other hiſtorie at all. Alſo I wyll declare and ſhewe / that in the ſayd writte or copy / be contayned certayne contrary and repugnant thinges / impoſſyble thynges / folyſſhe thynges / barbarous thynges / & madde tryfels / worthy to be laughed at. Furthermore I wyll ſpeake of the donation or gyft of certayne other emperours / beyng outher fayned / or els trifelyng / vayne / and of non effecte / wher I wyll putte to / that though Sylueſter had poſſeſſed theſe thynges / yet that nat withſtādyng

either hym ſelfe / or els any other pope / who euer he was / beyng ones driuen out & put from the poſſeſſion of thē / they can nat nowe after ſo great ſpace of tyme betwene be aſked or claymed agayne: neither by goddes lawe / neither yet by the lawe of man. Laſt of all  I ſhall ſhewe / that of thoſe thynges whiche the pope doth holde / there can be no preſcription made by any contynuaūce of tyme / be it neuer ſo longe. And nowe as touchyng to the fyrſt parte (and let vs ſpeke fyrſte of Cōſtantyne & afterwardes of Sylueſter) we muſt take hede & beware / that we doo nat pleade the emperours / ye / & in a maner the comune cauſe / with as ſlendre and ſmal eloquence and ſpeche: as priuate or meane mennes cauſes ar wonte to be pleaded / therefore as it were makyng an oration in the aſſemble & audience of Kynges and Princes (as doutles I do / for this myne oration ſhall come into theyr handes) it pleaſeth me to ſpeke vnto them / as if they were preſente / and ſet in ſyght afore myn eyes. I call and ſpeke vnto you Kynges and Princes (for it is harde for a priuate man which is in none offyce or auctorite to conceyue the Image of a royall and princely mynde) I ſerche and enquyre your mynde. I examine your conſcience. I aſke & requyre your teſtimonie, wolde any of you / if he had ben in Cōſtantines roume / haue thought / The authors ſheweth it to be nothyng lykely that any prince beynge in his ryghte mynde wolde of him ſelf be wyllyng to giue from him ſelfe ſo great thynges: as are fayned in the priuiledge to haue bē geuen of Conſtantyne. that himſelfe ought or that it had bē mete & cōueniēt bicauſe of liberte to haue giuē to another mā ye cyte of Rome his own coūtrey / ye chefe & heed place of all ye world / the lady & quene of cytees / moſt of power & might / moſt noble / and moſt rich of people / the venqueſſher & triumphant conquerour of all natiōs / the which is honorable & full of maieſtie / euyn in the ſight and beholdyng of it. And to gete hym ſelfe to a vyle and poore towne afterwardes / that is to witte to Bizantium. ye / moreouer that he ſhulde with the cyte of Rome / gyue Italy alſo / whiche is nat a prouince: but the heed of prouinces / ſholde gyue from him ſelfe the .iii. partes of Frauner / the .ii. Spaynes / ſhulde gyue Germanye / ſhulde gyue Englande / and all the hole weſte parte of the worlde / and ſhulde

depriue himſelfe of one of the .ii. eyes of the empier. No man can bringe me in mynde to beleue / that any man wolde do this / whiche were in his right mynde. For what thinge dothe god gyue you more deſyred and longed for?Of all thīges princes deſire moſt to enlarge their dominion & empire and the cōtrary they moſte hate. What thyng is more pleſaunt? What is more acceptable and better welcome / than to enlarge and encreace your kingdome and empiers? and very greatly to amplyfie and ſetforthe your dition and dominion both in length and bredthe / about this thynge (as me thinke I perceyue right well) all your care / all your cogitation and thoughte / and all your labour & trauayle / is ſpente and beſtowed bothe day and night. Herof do you principally and chefly hope to haue glory / for this thīg you do forſake pleaſures / for this you do putte youre ſelues in a thouſande perylles and ieoperdes. for this you ar contente to loſe your moſt derely beloued childrē. ye for this / you do nat grudge to loſe ꝑre of your owne bodis / for I neuer herde or redde / that any of you hath ben feared away from the endeuourment and goyng about to amplyfie and enlarge his empier: bycauſe he had loſte either an eye / a hande / or a legge / or els any other membre or parte of his body. But this hote and feruent deſyre of hauing great and large dominion / as euery man is moſte of might and power: ſo it moſte troubleth and vexeth or chafeth his mynde.The inſaciable ambicyon of great Alexander. Alexandre nat content to haue walked on fote through the deſertes and wilderneſſes of Affrike / and that he had conquered the Eeſt parte of the worlde / euyn vnto the formaſt parte of the Occian ſee.Rede Plutarche in the lyfe of Alexander and that he had ſubdued the Northe parte: in the myddes of ſo many woundes / and of ſo many miſchaunces / whan his ſoudiers refuſed and forſoke ſo farre / ſo ſharpe / and paynfull vyages and iornayes: yet he thoughte all that euer he had done before / was nothyng at all: except he had alſo made the Weſt parte / and all nations tributary to himſelfe / either by force and violence / or elles by the auctorite of his name. yt is but a ſmall thinge / wherof I do yet ſpeke. He had purpoſed moreouer to paſſe ouer the Occian ſee / and to ſerche

whether there were any other worlde / & to ſubdue it to his power / ye / & at the laſt (as I ſuppoſe) he wold haue entrepriſed & attempted to clyme vp into heuen Suche for the moſt parte is the wyll / deſyre / and appetyte of all kynges and princes: all be it they haue nat all lyke corage and boldneſſe. I wyll nat here reherce / how great ſynnes / and howe many abhominable thinges haue ben cōmitted and done / either for the winnyng & gettyng of empier & dominion: or els for the amplyfiyng & enlargyng of the ſame / in ſo moche that the one brother hath nat holden his handes from the murdryng & kyllyng of the other / neither the chyldren haue refrayned from the wycked effuſion of theyr fathers blode / neither the fathers haue refrayned from the kyllyng of theyr owne ſonnes: So that the temerite & folyſſhe lewde boldnes of man / is wōte in nothyng to rage more / or to vſe more cruelty / & to cōmytte more haynouſe offences or ſynnes: than here in this thynge. ye / & which a man may more maruayle at / you may ſee the myndes of olde men herein no leſſe quycke & full of courage: than be the myndes of yonge men / & of them that be chyldles: no leſſe than of thoſe that be fathers / & haue chyldren / & of Kynges & Princes: no leſſe than of tyrauntes. Now if dominion than or empire is wonte with ſo gret enforcemēt to be deſyred & ſought for: with how moche more inforcement & buſines muſt it nedes be kepte & menteyned? Neither is it ſo miſerable & wretched a thinge / nat to amplyfie & enlarge the ēpier / as it is to miniſſh it & to make it leſſe. Neither is it ſo ſhamfull a thīge for the / not to ioyne or put another māns realme vnto thyne: as it is that thyne ſhulde be ioyned to ye empier of an other man / for where we do rede / that certayne Kynges or certayn people / haue made ſome mē gouernours of theyr kyngdome or of theyr Cytyes: that was done ſo / not of the chefeſt or principall / nor of the greatteſt parte of the empyer: but in a maner of the hynmoſte or worſte / & the leſt parte therof / & that vnder ſuche maner & cōdityon / that he to whom ſuche gouernaunce & rule was gyuen: ſhulde alwayes acknowlege

the gyuer to be as lorde / and hīſelf to be as a miniſter & ſeruaūte vnder him. I be ſeche you than do nat they ſeme to be of an abiecte / vyle / & cowardly mynde / and nothyng of gentle & high or couragiouſe ſtomake: which do thīke & ſuppoſe / that Cōſtantine dyd alyenate & gyue from himſelfe the better parte of the empier. I do nat meane Rome & Italy / & other: but the thre Fraunces / where he had made warres & batayles / where he alone had of longe ſeaſon ruled and had dominion / Mani cōſiderations / why Conſtantyne wolde nat gyue from hym the beſt parte of the Empire. where he had ſette the rudimentes and fyrſt foundation of his Empyre and of hys glorte: ſeynge alſo that he was a man / whiche for the deſire to haue dominion / had made warre vpon nations / and whiche perſecuting his owne frendes / and men of his alyaunce with ciuyll warre: had depriued them of their empier / and which alſo had nat yet perfytly ouercome & ſubdued thoſe that were lefte and remayned of the contrary facyon & parte / whych alſo nat only was wonte for hope of glorie & renowne to make warre with many nations: but alſo was of neceſſyte cōpelled to do ſo / bycauſe he was prouoked ther vnto dayly of the Barbarians / which moreouer had abūdance & plentie of chyldren / of kynſefolke / & alſo of frendes / which knew alſo right well / that the ſenatours & the people of Rome / wolde repugne and ſtryue agaynſt his dede / whiche beſydes all this had proued & founde by experience the inſtabilite of ye nations venqueſſhed & ſubdued / which welnere at euery change of the emperour or gouernoure of the Romaynes: were wonte to ryſe & rebelle / whiche therto dyd remembre himſelfe / after the maner & cuſtome of other emperours nat to haue come to that dominion and empier / by the election of the ſenatours / and conſent of the people or communes / but to haue gotten and wonne it with an army of men / with the ſwerde with warre and batayle. What ſo great and ſtronge cauſe? what ſo vrgent and neceſſarie thinge was there / why he ſhuld (all theſe thynges nothynge regarded / but vtterly deſpiſed and ſette at nought) be willyng to vſe ſo excedyng great lybertie. They ſay / 

bycauſe he was made a chriſten man. What? ſhulde he therfore depriue himſelfe of the beſte parte of the empire. ye / I wyſſe / I ſuppoſe it was ſynne / ye and that great ſine and wicked abhomination / to raigne than any longer / and that to be an emperour and gouernour of realmes: coulde nat be ioyned or ſtande togyther with the Chriſten relygion. Thoſe that be in auoutry / thoſe that haue made themſelues riche by vſury / thoſe which vniuſtly do poſſeſſe other mēs goodes: after that they haue receyued baptiſme / are wonte to reſtore the wyfe / to reſtore the money / and to reſtore the goodes / whiche they had of other mennes. yf you haue this cogitations or thought with you / O Cōſtantine: you ought to reſtore to cyties their lybertie / and nat to chaunge the lorde / making theym where afore they were bounde to you: nowe bounde to another. But ſome man wyll ſay / this was nat the cauſe / but that you were moued to do this thinge / onely for the honour of relygion and holyneſſe or deuotion / as who wolde ſaye / that it were a more holy and deuoute thing to lay from you your empire: thā to adminiſtre and gouerne it for the defēce and mayntenaunce of faith and relygion. For as touchinge to the receyuers of it: this your donation or gyfte / ſhal neither be worſhipfull or honeſt: neither yet profytable vnto them. But if you wyll ſhewe your ſelfe a Chriſten man / if you wyll ſhewe tokens of your holyneſſe and deuotion / if you wyll do good / and prouyde / I do nat ſaye for the churche of Rome / but for the churche of god: now ſpecyally and principally play the prince and gouernour / that you may fyght for thē which neither maye / neither ought to fyght for them ſelfe / that you may by your auctorite make thē ſafe & ſure from ieoperdy: which ar in daunger of traynes and iniuries. It hathe pleaſed almighty god in tymes paſt / to open and ſhewe to Nabugodonoſor / to Cyrus / to Aſſuerus / and to many other kynges and princes: the highe miniſterie of the trouthe. yet for all that / he neuer required of any of them: that he ſhulde renounce and forſake his empier / that he ſhuld

gyue awaye parte of his kyngdome: but onely that he ſhulde reſtore lybertie to the Hebrues / and defende them frome the iniuries and noyaunce of their enemyes / that bordred vpon them. This was ſuffycient to the Iewes: this ſame alſo ſhall be ſuffyciente to Chriſten men. Conſtantine you are now made chriſten. But is it nat a ſhamfull thinge / that you beyng nowe a Chriſten emperour / are a ſmaler prince in dominion and empier: than you were beyng yet an Infydele?All power & auctorite is the gyfte of god. For to be a prince or gouernour: is a certayn principall and chefe gyfte of god / whervnto euyn the hethen princes alſo are iudged to be called & choſen of god. But happely ſome mā ſhall ſay / that Cōſtātyne was eaſed & delyuered frō his lepry / & therfore it is very lyke to be true / that he wolde make recompence / & paye home agayne with gretter meaſure: yt whiche he had receyued / Is it ſo in dede? Naaman yt noble mā of Syria / Rede the .v. chapit of the iiii. bokes of Kynges. whan he was cured & healed of his lepry by the prophete Helizeus / was wyllyng & content onely to offre gyftes & preſentes to him: but nat to gyue the one half of his ſubſtaunce & goodes / & wolde Cōſtantine offre the one halfe of his ēpier? It greueth me to make anſwere to this ſhamfull lyeng tale: as it were to an hiſtorie / of certaynte and vndouted trouth. For this lyeng fable is forged & coūterfaited to ye lykenes of the hiſtorie of Naaman & Helyzeus: as that other tale of the dragō in the lyfe of Silueſter / is imagined to the lykenes of that fable of the dragō of Bell.

Thinke nat / O Ceſar / that the blode of the Romaynes is ſo chaunged and gone out of kynde / that they wyll ſuffre this with a pacient and quiet mynde. and nat thinke it to be by all maner meanes eſchewed and auoyded / whiche in good fayth / nat the very women could ſuffre or abyde but raither wolde brenne themſelues togyther with

                        tion: it ought alſo to be ſure & out of dout / that Sylueſter dyd accepte the ſame gyfte. Now therof haue we non euydence: wherby we might be aſſured and put out of dout. But parauēture you wyll ſaye / it is credyble and lykely / that he dyd accept that graunt. ye / ywyſſe / I thinke ſo / and that nat onely he dyd accepte and alowe that donation: but alſo that it is credyble and lykely / that he dyd craue & deſyre it. And that through continuall & importunate requeſtes and prayers: He gat it of Conſtātine / in a maner whether he wold or nat. Why / I ſay / do you cal that thīg credible: which is contrary to the opinion of al men? And all be it there is mention made of the donation or gifte in the pagine or writte of the priuyledge: yet is nat therfore to be ſuppoſed & thought / that the donation was accepted & taken. But rather contrary wiſe bycauſe there is no mention made of the acceptation: it is to be ſayd / that it was nat gyuen. So / than it maketh more agaīſt you / that Sylueſter refuſed this gyfte: than it maketh with you / that Cōſtātine wold gyue it / & a benefyte is nat gyuen to any man againſt his wyll: if he lyſte nat to receyue it. And we ought nat onely to deme / that Sylueſter dyd refuſe theſe gyftes: but alſo that he dyd ſecretely ſhewe / that neither Conſtātine might rightfully gyue them / neither himſelfe laufully receyue or take them. But O blinde and alwayes folyſſhe / and myſaduyſed couetouſneſſe Let vs graunt that you could alſo bringe forthe writynges / whiche were true / incorrupte / ſyncere / and

perfyte of the aſſente and agremente of Sylueſter to the ſame: Dothe it folowe therfore / that thoſe thynges hath ben gyuen in very dede / which are conceyued in the writynges? Where was poſſeſſyon gyuen? Where was the delyuering vp in to his handes? For if Conſtantine dyd gyue to Sylueſter nothing elſes but onely the dede or writīg: than was nat his mynde to do Silueſter a pleaſure or good turne: but to gyue him a mocke. you ſaye it is very lykely / that he / whiche doth gyue any thinge: dothe alſo delyuer poſſeſſyon of the ſame. Take hede / and be ware what you ſpeke / ſeing that it is vndoubted / that poſſeſſyon was neuer delyuered: and it is alſo doubte / whether euer the ryght and tytle were gyuen or nat. It is lyke to be true / that he which gaue nat the poſſeſſyon wolde nat gyue the right and tytle. Is it nat vndouted and of certaynte / that poſſeſſyon was neuer delyuered? whiche thyng who ſo euer wyll denye: he is without all honeſtie / and vtterly ſhamles. Dyd Conſtantine brynge or lede Silueſter in to the Capitoly houſe / as it were one tryumphing / amonge the reioyſynges & ioyfull ſhowtynges of the multytude of the Cytizens of Rome / beyng yet meydels and hethen men? Dyd he ſet him in a chayre or ſeate of golde / all the hole company of ſenatours beyng aſſyſtent and ſtandyng by? And dyd he cōmaūde the heed offycers / eche one of them accordyng to his dignyte / to ſalute him and to honour him / as kynge or chefe gouernoure?
                     Theſe be the thynges / whiche are wonte to be done towardes newe princes: and nat onely ſome one palace (as for example the palace of Lateran) to be delyuered. Dyd he afterwardes lede hī about through all Italy? wente he with him to all the thre partes of Fraūce? Dyd he go with him in to both Spaynes? Wente he with him to the Germaynes / and to the reſydue of the Weſt regiōs? or if they both were greued and lothe to trauayle in their owne perſones ouer ſo great a parte of the worlde / and ſo many dyuerſe landes and coūtrees: whom made they their deputies? and to whom aſſygned they ſo great an office? which

ſhulde bothe in the emperours ſtede delyuer poſſeſſyon: and in Sylueſters ſtede receyue and take it? Doutleſſe theſe muſt nedes haue ben ſome great men and of exellent auctorite / and yet who they were: no man can tell. In the tyme of our remembraunce (bycauſe I wyl paſſe ouer the aunciēt enſamples of olde tyme) we neuer ſawe it otherwiſe done / whan any mā hathe ben made lorde / either of any cyte / regyon / or prouynce: but that ſo onely poſſeſſyon hathe ben iuged to be gyuen and delyuered to him: if they olde offycers be depoſed or put downe / and new be made and put in their ſtedes? Though Sylueſter wold nat at that tyme haue requyred this to be done: yet dyd it appertayne and belonge to the magnifycencie of Conſtantyne (that he might declare / nat onely by his wordes / but alſo by his dede / that he dyd gyue poſſeſſyon to Sylueſter / to haue depoſed his owne deputes / lyeutynauntes / and other offycers / & to commaunde other to be put into their roumes / by the nomination & aſſygnement of Sylueſter. No man can ſaye / that poſſeſſyon was delyuered or gyuen vp: whiche remayneth ſtyll in the handes of the ſame men / whiche poſſeſſed it before / and whan the newe lorde dare nat put them from it. But ſuppoſe / yt this thinge alſo doth nothyng let or withſtand / but that we may thinke neuer the leſſe / that Sylueſter had poſſeſſyon and let vs ſaye / that all thinges were than adminiſtred and done contrary to the commune maner and cuſtome / & contrary to nature: I pray you / after that Conſtātine was gone awaye / what gouernours and rulers dyd Sylueſter make of the prouince or cytes? what warres or batayles made he? what natiōs that were rebelles dyd he oppreſſe or holde vnder? or by what captaynes & offycers did he theſe thīges / A bytter mocke. you do make anſwere & ſaye / we do knowe none of all theſe thinges. Verely I do thinke the ſame. All theſe thinges were done in the nyghte tyme / and therfore no man coulde ſe them. Go to now furthermore / I pray you / was Sylueſter in poſſeſſyon? Who than dyd put him out of poſſeſſyon? For he was nat euer contynually

in poſſeſſyon / neither any of his ſucceſſoures / at the leaſt wiſe / vnto Gregorius Magnus / whiche alſo was without poſſeſſyon. Nowe who ſo euer is out of poſſeſſion / and can nat proue that himſelf hath ben driuen out of poſſeſſyon: doutleſſe that man had neuer poſſeſſyon. And if he will ſaye / that himſelfe hath had at any tyme poſſeſſion: he his ſtarke madde Seeſt thou here nowe / how I do proue the alſo to be madde? For elles: tell thou me / who droue the pope out of poſſeſſyon? Conſtātine himſelfe / or his chyldren / or Iulianus / or els any other emꝑour? Shewe the name of him / that dyd put him from poſſeſſyon. Shewe the tyme whan it was done. Shewe wherfore he was fyrſt expulſed. Wherfrō nexte / & ſo forth in ordre. Whether was he expulſed by ſedicion and manſlaughter / or elles without theſe thynges? Dyd al nations conſpire agaīſt him to gether at one time / or els whiche of them began fyrſt? What? Dyd no man at all helpe or aide him? Nat ſomoch as any of thoſe / whiche had ben made gouernours & rulers of cyties & prouīces by Sylueſter / or by ſome other pope? Dyd he leſe all to gether in one daye: or els by lytell & lytell. One ꝑte at one tyme / & a nother parte at a nother tyme? Dyd he & his heed offycers make reſiſtence: or els dyd they at the firſt rebellyon & buſynes gyue vp their poſſeſſion & offices / & put thēſelues frō all to gether? What? the cōquerours & ouer comers? dyd they nat make hauocke / with killīg & ſleing thoſe wretches & vile ſorte of men / whome they iuged vnworthy of ye empier: to the reuengyng of their owne cōtumelie & iniurie? to the defence & mayntenaūce of the dominiō: which they had wōne & gotten by force and violēce / to the contēpte & deſpyte of our relygiō / and alſo to the example of thē that ſhulde come after their tyme? Did no man of all thoſe / whiche were vanqueſſhed & ouercome: flie or rōne away? Did no man lurke and hide hīſelfe? was no man afraide? O meruaylouſe & wōderfull chaūce / that the empire of Rome / which was gotten & wonne with ſo great labours / with ſo moche blodeſhed ſhulde ſo peſably / 

ſo quietly / either be gotten or loſt of the Chriſten preſtes: that no blodſhedynge / no warre / neither yet any complaynte hath come bytwene / and alſo (which thinge a man ought no leſſe to meruayle at) that no man knoweth or can tell / by whom this thinge was done / nor at what tyme / nor howe or which waye / nor how longe it was in doing. A man might ſuppoſe & wene / that Sylueſter had raigned in the woddes amonge trees: nat at Rome amonge men / and that he was driuen out of poſſeſſyon / by the winter ſhowers and colde ſtormes: & nat by men. Who is he that doth nat knowe / if he be any thing acquaīted with hiſtories: how many kynges / how many cōſules / how many dictatours / how many protectoures of the cōmune peple / called Tribuni plebis / how many controllers & iuges of mēnes maners / called Cenſores / how many chamberlayns called Cediles / haue ben created and made in Rome? And there is nat one of ſo great a multytude & nombre / of ſo auncient & olde antyquite vnknowen to vs. We do know alſo / how many noble captaynes haue ben of the Athenienſes / how many of the Thebanes / howe many of the Lacedemoniās. we haue knowledge of all their fyghtes / battayles and ſkirmiſſhes / made both on the lāde & on ye water. we do know alſo / who hath ben kinges & gouernours of the Perſes / of the Medes / of the Chaldeis / & of the Hebrues / & of many other peoples & nations / & howe euery one of theſe hath receyued their kīgdomes / or hathe holden & kepte it / or how they haue loſt it / or haue recouered it againe.

Nat Damaſus of Theodoſius nat Syryne of Archadius / nat Anaſtaſius of Honorius / nat Ihon̄ of Iuſtiniane / nat other moſt holy popes of other moſt noble emperours / but they haue always openly graūted / Rome & Italye with the prouinces afore named to belonge to the ēperours / & therfore ye peaces of golde coyned in thoſe tymes (becauſe I wyl nat ſpeke of other monumētes / & of ye tēples of the Cyte of Rome) wherof ſome are yet remaynyng: hath their ſcripture written / nat in Greke lr̄es / but in latyn lr̄es / both the coynes of Cōſtātyne after he was become chriſtē: & alſo of ye other emperours / almoſt euery one after him in ordre / of which coynes / I haue my ſelf many in myne own hādes / cōmunely hauyng vnder the Image of the croſſe / this ſubſcription.

                     ¶The thyrde princypall parte of this oration / in which the author ſheweth / that Conſtantine was become Chriſten afore that Silueſter was pope / & that thoſe gyftes whiche Conſtātine gaue: were gyuen to the pope nexte after Silueſter / which ſame alſo were but meane or ſmall thinges / & no more than ſuffycient to the popes ſuſtentation.
                     EVery hyſtorie almoſt / which is worthy the name of an hiſtorie: telleth and maketh mention / that Conſtātine / 
                           Conſtantyne was made Chriſten of a chylde / long afore that Silueſter was pope.
                           Euſebius the author of the eccleſiaſticall hiſtorie.
                         euyn whan he was a childe: became Chriſtē with his father Conſtātius / & ye long tyme afore that Silueſter was pope / as Euſebius ye writer of the eccleſiaſticall hiſtorie / whome Rufyne a man right exellently lerned / hath trāſlated / into the latyne tonge / and hathe alſo added two bokes of his owne tyme / which were bothe of them welnere in Cōſtantines tyme. Beſydes this / we haue alſo ye teſtimonie & witneſſe of ye pope of Rome / whiche nat onely was preſent at the doyng of theſe thinges: but alſo bare a great rule in the ſame / beyng alſo nat a witneſſe: but the author or doer / nat ye teller or rehercer of another mānes buſynes: but of his owne. He whome I do meane:Melchiades pope nexte afore Sylueſter. is Melchiades ye pope nexte afore Silueſter which ſaith in this wiſe. The church was come euyn vnto this poynt now: yt nat only people & natiōs / but alſo the princes of Rome / whiche helde thempier of the worlde: dyd come together to the faith of Chriſt and to the ſacramentes of the faith. Among whom /

And to be ſhort the afore reherſed emperoure gaue exceding gret giftes / and he began firſt the buyldinge of the churche of ſaynt Peter / in ſo moche that he did forſake his emperiall ſeate or place: and graunted it to the vſe and behofe of bleſſed Peter / & his ſucceſſours. Lo / here Melchiades maketh mention of nothyng that was gyuen by Conſtātine: but onely the palace of Laterane / and certayne other lādes / of whiche Gregorie very ofte maketh mētion in his regeſtre. Where than are they nowe / whiche do nat ſuffre it to be doubted / whether the donation of Conſtātine be of value and ſtrengthe / or nat? ſeyng that the ſayde donation or gyfte bothe was made afore Sylueſters tyme / and was alſo of priuate thinges onely? which thyng although it is playne & euident ynough: yet that nat withſtanding / we muſt ſomwhat diſpute & reſon of that priuilege / which theſe folyſſh felowes are wonte to alledge and bring forth.
                  
                  
                     ¶ The fourth prīcipall ꝑte of this oration / in which the author ſheweth it to be vntruly ſayde / that the copye or example of this donation is founde in the decrees / or elles taken out of the hiſtorie of ſaynt Sylueſter / and alſo declareth what folyſſhe / what impoſſyble / what barbarous / and what repugnaūt & contrary thīges / with other vnreſonablenes / is cōtayned in the ſayde copie. & beſydes this he maketh mention of the fayned or friuolouſe donation of certayn other emperours. And laſte of al he ſheweth / that in caſe it were / ſo that Sylueſter or any other pope had at any tyme poſſeſſed theſe thīges: yet being ones put out of poſſeſſyō / & ſo long cōtinuīg diſpoſſeſſed as they haue done: they cā nat now after ſo long ſpace of tyme clayme thē agayn / neither by the lawe of god nor man. &c.
                     
                        ANd fyrſt of all to begyne with / nat onely that felowe which wolde fayne ſeme to be Gratian whiche added certayn thynges to the worke of Gracian / is to be repreued of lewde vnſhamfaſtnes: but alſo they are to be reproued of ignoraunce and folyſhenes / The pagine of the donation / is nat foū
                           de in the olde decrees collected by Gratian. which do wene or ſuppoſe / that the pagine of the priuilege is contayned in Gratians worke / whiche thynge neyther any lerned man dyd euer ſuppoſe: & agayn it is nat founde in the moſte auncyēt and eldeſt bokes of the decrees / & if in any place Gratian ſhuld haue made mention of this thīge / he ſhuld haue done it nat in this place (where they do put it interrupting and breking of the ordre and contexte of his oration and ſpeche) but rather in that place / where he ſpeketh of the paction & couenaunte of Ludouyke. Beſydes this there are two thouſād places in the decrees: whiche do proue this place nat to be true / of the whiche that place is one / where the afore reherſed wordes of Melchiades are alleged. Some men do ſay / that he whiche added this chapitour to the decrees: was called Palea / Palea in latin ſygnifyeth chaffe. either for that this was his very right name: or els bycauſe theſe thinges / whiche he dyd adde or put to of his own / if they be cōpayred to Gratiane are iuged to be / as it were / chaffe nere to the corne. But how ſo euer the trouthe is concerning this: it is a very great ſhame & an vnſhamely thinge to beleue / that collector & gatherer of the decrees / either dyd nat know theſe thinges / whiche haue ben added & put to ſyns of Palea: or els dyd ſet gretly by them / and accompe and take them for true thinges. This is well than / we are ſufficed / we haue the victory & our owne purpoſe. Firſt that Gratiane doth nat ſaye this thīge ſo as they belyed him: but moreouer he denyeth it and preueth it falſe and vntrue / as eaſily it maye be perceyued by a thouſand places and mo. Secondarelye / that they do alledge for theym ſelues one man alone / and that ſuche one as is vnknowen / and of none auctorite / a tryfler / and ſo folyſſhe alſo: that he hath added certayne thynges of his owne faynyng to the ſayd Gratiane: whiche can nat agree

with the other ſayinges of the ſame Gratian / is this than this authour / that you bryng forth? do you vſe the teſtimonie of him alone? Do you recite a folyſhe writtyng of him in paper / for the confyrmation of ſo gret a matter: agaīſt ſix hundred kynges of proffes? But I loked for it / that you ſhulde haue ſhewed lytell Images of golde / tytles & wrytynges in marble / and a thouſand authours. But you do ſay / that Palea him ſelfe bryngeth forth the author / and ſheweth the very fountayne of the hiſtorie / and calleth to witneſſe Gelaſius the pope / with many other biſſhoppes Of the hiſtorie (ſayth he) of Silueſter whiche bleſſed Gelaſius in the counſell of .lxx. byſſhoppes reporteth to be redde of Catholyke men / and ſaith / that many churches doth folow this ſame maner / accordyng to the olde aunciēt vſage / in ye which hiſtorie it is redde / Conſtantyne. &c. And a gret deale before where mention is made of bokes whiche are to be redde / & which nat to be redde: he hath ſayd alſo / we do know that the actes of ſaynte Silueſter the byſſhoppe are redde of many catholyke men in the cyte of Rome: al be it that we do nat know ye name of him that wrote them / and the churches accordynge to the olde vſage do folowe the ſame. Oh / here is a wonderfull authorite / a meruaylouſe teſtimonie and recorde / & a ſtronge & inuincyble probation. I graunt you this / that Gelaſius ſayd this: where he ſpeaketh of the councel of .lxx. byſſhoppes / dyd he therfore ſay that the pagine or copie of the preuilege is redde in the lyfe or actes of ſaynte Silueſter? and that at Rome: the auctorite of whiche churche many other churches do folowe / whiche thynge I do nat denye: but I graunt / confeſſe / and knowlege / ye / and I do offre my ſelf to be a wytneſſe therof with Gelaſius / but what cā this thynge profyght or auayle you? but onely that it myght appere / that you wolde haue lyed / in alledgynge and bryngynge forth witneſſes and recordes. His name is nat knowen / which added this to ye decrees / & yet he alone doth ſay this thynge / his name is nat knowen / which wrote ye hiſtorie of Silueſter

and yet he alone is brought forth / and that falſly for a wytneſſe and a recorde. And do you good and wyſe men iuge this to be ſufficient / ye / and more than ſufficient / to the teſtimonie and witneſſyng of ſo greate a matter? But conſyder now and ſe / how great difference there is betwene your iugemente and myne. I truly? al though this priuylege were contayned in ye hiſtorie of Sylueſter:The hiſtorye of Silueſter is but a fayned and a lyyng hiſtorye. wolde nat for all that thynke that it were to be accompted and taken for true. For as moche as that hiſtorie is none hiſtorie: but a fayned and a ſhamleſe lyeng tale / as I ſhall ſhewe and declare herafter / and alſo / ſeing that none other mā / namely beyng of any auctorite: dothe make any mention of this priuylege.Iacobus voraginēſis / the writter of ſa

And as Tertullyane maketh mētion / whan Pontius Pilatus had written to Tiberius Ceſar / of the merueylouſe and wonderfull workes & dedes of Chriſt / and nat to the ſenatours (for the heed offycers & gouernours had ben wonte to write of gret maters vnto ye ſenate) the ſenatours toke this thyng greuouſly / & were gretly dyſcontente therwith. And whan Tiberrius gaue this prerogatyue / that Ieſus ſhulde be worſhipped for a god: they gaynſayde it / onely for the preuy indignation & grudge which they had in their mindes: for that the dignyte of the ſenatorie ordre was offended & hurte. And that thou mayſt knowe of how gret ſtrength the aucorite of the ſenate is: they optayned that he ſhulde nat be worſhipped for a god.Howe greate the auctorite of the ſenate was. Beſides this thou ſayſt the Optymates whom we vnderſtāde either to be the chefe men in the cōmune weale / & than

why doeſt thou name theſe: ſeīg ther is no worde ſpoken of other offycers? or els by optimates we vnderſtāde thoſe / which are nat Populares / that is / which ſeche nat to get ye beneuolēce & good wyll of ye people but are ye fauourers & defēders of the beſt men & of ye good ꝑties or ſydes / as Cicero ſheweth & declareth in a certayne oratiō / that ſuche are called optimates. And therfore we do ſay / that Ceſar afore that the cō
                        mune weale was oppreſſed: was Popularis / & that Cato was one of the optimates / the dyfferēce of whiche two wordes Saluſt hath declared. And they whiche are called optimates in this ſygnifycatiō / are no more ſayde to be called to counſayle: thā other populare perſons or other good men. But what meruayle is it / if the optimates be there made of counſayle: where the hole people (if we gyue credēce to this mā) dyd iuge with ye ſenate & Ceſar? and that ye people beyng ſubiecte to the church of Rome. And which people is this? The people of Rome? whye is it than nat called ye people of Rome: rather than the people ſubiecte? What newe & ſtraūge cōtumelye / & meruaylouſe rebuke is this vnto yt cytizēs of Rome: of whō ye beſt & moſt exellēte poete Vergyle reporteth in this wyſe. Tu regere īperio populos Romane memēto. Thou people of Rome / remembre thou to gouerne & rule people. That people whiche is the gouernour & ruler of other peoples: is called here Populos ſubiacēs a people ſubiect / which thīg was neuer herde heretofore. For in this (as Gregorius witneſſeth in many epiſtles) diffreth ye biſſhop of Rōe frō other biſſhoppes: for yt he onely is the gouernour of a free people. But this admitted / that it were euen ſo as thou ſayſt Are nat other peoples alſo ſubiectes? doeſt thou meane of other peoples alſo? how coulde it be poſſyble / yt all the people beīg ſubiectes to the churche of Rome / were within thre dayes p̄ſēt at the makīg of that decree? how be it all ye vile ſorte & the raſcall of ye people I am ſure / dyd nat iuge or decree. Moreouer / why ſhulde Conſtantine call the people ſubiecte: afore that he had made them ſubiecte to the pope of Rome

Agayne / why are they / whiche are called ſubiectes: ſayd to haue borne a rule / in ye makīge of the decree? Beſydes this / they are ſayd to haue decreed euē this ſame thīg: that their ſelues ſhulde be ſubiectes: & that he to whom they were all redy ſubiectes: ſhulde haue them ſubiectes vnto hī ſelfe.

Or whiche landes are thoſe / namely of poſſeſſyons? we are wonte to ſay Poſſeſſions of landes / but nat landes of poſſeſſyons / thou gyueſt landes and lorde ſhyppes / and doſt nat declare nor expreſſe whiche landes

they be / thou haſt enriched thē with diuerſe thynges: and doſt nat ſhewe neither whan / neither with what thynges thou wylt that the plages or regions of the worlde be diſpoſed by Silueſter: but thou doſt nat ſhewe / in what maner or kynde of diſpoſyng or orderynge / thou haſte gyuen and graunted theſe thynges before. Why doſte thou nowe ſygnifye and gyue knowledge / that thou haſte begonne this daye to honour the churche of Rome / and to graunt the priuilege to it? doſt thou this day graunt and gyue? doſt thou this day make it riche or endowe it? why doſt thou than ſay / we haue graunted / and we haue made riche or endowed? wotteſt thou what thou ſpekeſt / or what thou meaneſt thou beeſte? I ſpeke to the / the forger of this lye: and nat to the very good prince Conſtantyne. But why do I require or looke for any wiſdome / or any lernyng in the: whiche arte nat endowed with any wyt or any literature at all as it appereth right wel whan thou ſayſt Luminariorū for Luminariū and orientalibꝰ traſferri regionibꝰ: where thou oughteſt to haue ſaid / ad oriētales trāſferri regiones? Moreouer which be thoſe .iiii. plages or quarters of the worlde? which reckeneſt thou to be ye eeſt plage? Thracia? dothe it nat (as I ſayd before) inclyne to the north? Iurie? but it lyeth more toward the ſouth / as beyng nere vnto Egipte / whiche alſo calleſt thou the weſt plage? Italy / But theſe thynges were done in Italye / whiche no man lyuyng or abydyng there: doth call the weſt plage or region / for as moch as we do ſay / the hiſpaynes to be in ye weſt. And Italye on the one ſyde / leaneth to the ſouthe / & on the other ſyde / leaneth to the northe: rather than to the weſt. Which calleſt thou the ſeptemtrionall or north plage? Thracia? But thou thyſelfe ſhalte haue it to be on the eaſt ſyde / or els Aſya? But this it ſelfe alone occupieth and poſſeſſeth the hole eaſt. And the north is commune to it and Europa / which calleſt thou the meridionall or ſouth plage. No dout of it / thou meaneſt Affricke. But why diddeſt thou nat expreſſe and ſhewe forthe ſome prouince by name? excepte peraduenture

the moores of Ethiopia were vnder the empier of Rome. And yet neuer ye leſſe Aſia and Aphrike haue no place here / where the worlde is deuyded in to foure partes / and the regyons of eche parte are reherſed by name: but whan it is deuyded in to thre partes / Aſye / Affrike / and Europe. Excepte thou doſte name Aſya for the Aſyatike prouince / and Aphrike for the prouince / whiche is nere vnto the people of Getulya / whiche I can nat ſee / why they ſhulde be principally and chefely named. Wolde Conſtantine haue ſpoken in ſuche wiſe / whan he had ſpoken of the foure principall partes of the worlde: that he wolde haue named theſe regions / & nat haue named other? and that he wolde haue begonne with Iurie / whiche is rekened and accompted a part of Syria / and whiche at that tyme was no longer Iurie / for as moche as Ieruſalem was deſtroyed / and the Iewes chaced from thence and welnere deſtroyed / in ſo moche that I do ſuppoſe / that ſcacely any Iewe was than remainynge in his owne countrey: but all inhabytid other nations? Where I beſech you / was Iurie than / whiche was no longer called Iurie / euen lykewyſe as we do ſe nowe at this day the name of that lande deſtroyed? And euen as whan the Chananies were driuen out / that region was no longer called Chanania but the name beyng chaunged / was called Iudia of the newe inhabytauntes the Iewes: ſo whan the Iewes were baniſſhed and driuen out / and ſtraungers did īhabyte it: it was no longer called Iurie. Thou nameſt Iewrie and Thracia / and Ilelandes: but the Hiſpaynes / and Fraunces / & Germayne / thou thynkeſt nat worthy to be named / and whan thou ſpekeſt of other languages / as Hebrue / Greke / and Barbarouſe: thou ſpeakeſt nat of any of the prouinces vſynge the Latyne tonge or language. I perceyue now / thou dydeſt therfore ouerchippe or leue them out here: that thou myghteſt contayne or comprehende them afterwardes in the donatyon. And what? were nat the weſt prouynces ſo moche worthe / that they myght mayntayne and vpholde the coſtes and charges

of the lyghtes: excepte that the reſydue of the worlde dyd helpe alſo? I paſſe ouer here / that thou ſayeſt theſe thynges to be graunted per / largitatem that is to ſay of lyberalyte and bowntuouſnes▪ than was it nat done for ye healyng of the leprie / ſo as they do ſay for els it were a ſtrāge preſūptiō in hī: who ſo euer wolde put or reckē a remuncratiō or recōpenſation in ſtede of lyberal or free gyftes. ¶Beato Silueſtre / e

We do ſe that Xenophon hath named the landes & the prouīces / which were either wyllyng & of their owne accorde or els by conq̄ſt / vnder ye empire of Cyrus.Homer.

The enſample of whom / bothe many greke authors / & in eſpeciall our latyn authours / Ennius / Vergilius / Lucanus / Statius / & certayne other haue folowed: We do ſe alſo / yt Ioſue & Moyſes in the deuyding of the lande of Beheſt / Rede in the boke of Ioſue from the xiii. chap. of the .xix. incluſiuelye: dyd diſcribe & marke out euyn all the lytell ſtretes.

Where do they make an ende? Are the boūdes or meres of the weſt / of the eeſt of the North / & of the South marked forthe or ſette / and as certayne, as be the boundes or meres of Aſie / Affrike & Europe.
