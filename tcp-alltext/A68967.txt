               And we Philip by the ſame grace, prince of Spaine, of both the Secillies of Ieruſalem, &c. Lord of Hubſburgh of Flanders, &c.
               To al them yt ſhal ſee theſe preſents, gretings.
            
            Foraſmuch & to ſhew and declare the better our inheritant lāds on this ſide & ye good and true ſubiectes therof, the vpright loue, fauour, and affection, which we Emperors alwayes haue borne and yet are bearing. Not requiring, but that which is and concerneth their commō welfaring, reſt, peace, and aſſuraunce. We haue ſent for, and cauſed to come ouer, our welbeloued prince of Spaine, to the intent that hee him ſelfe ſhoulde ſee, examine, viſite, and knowe the ſaid our heritable landes of the Low countreys, proceeded of ſucceſſion, and likewiſe ſhewe vnto the ſubiectes thereof, the good and ſpecial true loue and effection which he beareth vnto them. To the intent they ſhuld be more enclined, affectioned, and to bee bounde to remaine, and for the ſame certaine other ſpeciall reaſons, haue we reſolued,

and concludteh him to be receiued, helde, and ſworne, by the States and members of all our ſaide heritable landes, and among others by the Prelates, Nobles, & foure chiefe Cities of this our Dukedome and countreys of Brabant, for their naturall and chiefeſt Prince and Lorde, for him his heires and ſucceſſors, to bee occupied after our diſceaſe, the ſaid our Dukedome and countreys of Brabant, with his appurtenances, as iuſt and lawfull Lorde thereof: All which we haue cauſed to be propoſed and declared to the aforeſaid three States of Brabant in our preſence, and in the preſence of our welbeloued ſiſter, and Aunte of our Prince, lady Marie Queene Dawgiereſſe of Hungarie, of Boheme, &c.

And conſidering that our ſaid ſonne thinkes and doeth require all that which hee ſhall graunt, promiſe, & ſweare vnto them pointly to obſerue and perfourme. So haue we cauſed to be made communicacion with the aforeſaide three States of Brabant, for to haue our ioyful incomming to be ſeene ouer and viſited, becauſe that they them ſelues might conſider al that which oughte therein to be moderated and variated. And for to refourme the articles which ſhoulde bee found not to be obſeruable, nor mainteined. According to which ther had bene kept, diuers communicacions and aſſemblings together, ſo that finally after diuers delayings, aduiſements, opinions, & reports reſpectiuely made one to another, they haue in that behalfe conſented and willed them ſelues, according to ye acte hereupon made, ſigned by them. And alſo we Prince hauing ſure and well vnderſtanded the aforeſayde ioyfull income of our Lorde and Father, and likewiſe the adioyned letters and additions thereof, with alſo the other adioyned

letters and graunts of the ſayd our grandfather mentioned in the laſt article of our aforeſaid ioyful income, being truely tranſlated and ſette ouer in the Spaniſh tongue, and likewiſe alſo the vocation and moderation therof, & that which therunto is ſet by, according to the contention of the aforeſaid acte, willing and requeſting according to the good pleaſure of our ſaid Lord and Father, the common countrey of Brabant, and the good people inhabitantes and ſubiects therof, their rights, priuileges, freedomes, cuſtomes, vſances, and old proceedings, obſerue and perfourme, eſpecially conſidered, the great and manifolde ſeruices, fauours, and fidelitie by them at diuers times done, and ſhewed to our forefathers, Dukes, and Duceſſes of Brabant, of diſceaſed memorie, and among others to our remembred Lorde the Emperour our Lord and father, as true ſubiects ought to do to their Lords. And as we truſt that they likewiſe will do to vs hereafter.
