            And if nature do praescribe this, that one man should assist, and take care of an other, if it be but onely for the cause that he is a man, it is necessarie, according to the same nature, that the vtilitie of all things be cōmon.

               trarie to nature, then death, then pouertie, then payne, or then whatsoeuer may chaūce to our body, or outward things. For if so we be affected, that euery one may catch vnto him selfe, and hide from others, there is loue broken, then is humane societie buried. It is more laudable therfore, and according to nature (sayth Cicero) to take vpon vs the greatest labour, and molestatios, for the conseruation and helping (if it may be) of all nations, imitating that same Hercules (whom fame, mindfull of all benesites, hath canonized, or as it were made a God) then to liue in all securitie: not onely without any griefes, but abounding also in all pleasures, and riches, beautie, and strength.
            Which, ô so sacred a sayeng (right worshipfull) hath made me, quite forgetting my impotencie, willingly to put on armour also against ignoraunce, and boldly to march towardes the castle of Arte, there to offer my seruice to sciēce, the generall. Of one thing being sure, that the armour, which I carie, is most precious and costly. Wherfore, I shall humbly craue at his handes, that I may, not as an enemy, be receiued into his gates: and thē, if he shall esteme me vnworthie, or vnhable to carie so costlie and waightie armour, I shall (right gladly) yeld the same, to the vse of some of his valiaunt Captaines: to whom my good will, now shewed by endeuour, is nothing inferiour.
            Which good will in deede, is all that I am hable to shewe, and that taken away, my burden might easely presse me to the ground: for considering so ripe a world, such plenty of Artes, such profound wittes, such learned eares, and, there withall, such Tigrish whelpes of Momus pampering, if feare should haue surprised my senses, and there withall (if it had bene possible) vanquished my zeale, to the vtter ruine of these my labours, the wise would not haue meruailed at all. Good will ther fore may, of right, he called the bulwarke of the commō wealth. For what thing is so hard, that good will maketh not easie? what is so highe, that good will may not reach? what is so worthy, that good will shall not winne? It is loue, it is truth, it is the author of all artes, and the key of all treasure saith Demosthenes. In sine, there
                  
                     〈◊〉
                  . is nothing so highe in the heauens aboue, nothing so low in the earth beneath, nothing so profound in the bowels of Arte, nor any thing so hid in the secretes of nature, as that good will dare not enterprise, search, vnclose, or discouer.

               ding of him selfe, accordingly also imploying his time, his calling shalbe to a higher steppe: which likewise shalbe required of him. For therfore sayth the renowmed Athenian Oratour, By how much thou hast a more excellent nature, by somuchDemosth. ex. or. ama. thou exspectest greater dignities, and somuch the rather, I iudge, thou wilt make triall of thy selfe. And surely Cicero supposeth it cannot be in a man to hid his vertue2. de. Finib. in him selfe. Which moued him to say, we are driuen to it of nature, to desire to prosite many, especially in teaching, and reuealing the reasons of wisedome. Therfore it is not easie to sinde such a one, as will not be cōtent to teach that vnto an other, which he knoweth him selfe. So that we are not onely inclined to learne, but to teach also. And truth it is in deede, for what pietie is in him, that seeth another

out of his way, and will not shew him of it? or what humanitic hath he that carnestly vseth his tyme, in gathering together the goodes of vertue, and at length, in one instant, causeth them to perish with his body?
            As therfore (saith Demosthenes) he is accompted great and mighty, whom euery

Which thinges cōsidered, I shall not neede to render accompt of my enterprise, neither (I hope) to craue the further ance of the godly learned. For although, to discusse the secretes of nature, which are so meruatlous in mās body, it is the hardest point in Philosophie, yet is not the difficultie therof such, as ought wholly to terrisie vs from the searche therof: nay, rather it ought to spurre vs forward, to vse more serious diligence therein. Since the payne is not halfe so great, that is taken in the winning therof, as the vtilitie rewaraeth of that which is obtained.
            And albeit this is so worthy a matter, as needeth no authours commendation, and therfore should worthely merite the labour of the learned: yet as Darius denounced

Of which, I haue now endeuoured to turne one cocke. Which faithfully beyng done, accordyng to my might, such as it is, I offer, before all others vnto you right worshipfull, and my most bounden, beseeching you, to accept the dedication of these my rude labours: which, were they as worthy as Galens, you might of duetie chalenge. Notwithstandyng, whatsoeuer they are, good will is full in them. And that is the rest of my hope, and that is it, which your worship neuer denied. Which cherishing me, I am bold to publish this History of Man, vnder your name, to the benesite of my Christian brethren, the godlie, and toward Chirurgians of England.

Then was I wholly ouercome in this purpose, and then did I clearely see, how that to write Methodes or meanes to cure the affected partes of the body, the partes them selues beyng altogether vnknowen, or falsely imagined of, might rather be a meane to indurate the cataract of inscience, then to eate it through, or take it away. So thus I decreed to chaunge my purpose, that is, in steede of the Booke of Tumours, which I had before promised, to compile some worke of Anathomy, whiche might occupy fufficient scope to entreate of all the partes of man.

sondry inferiour Officers and labouryng persons, neither all to one ende, vse, or office, but some to digge, some to square stones, some to carie them to woorkemen, &c: Euen so I, not hauyng the knowledge to deuise, nor the pollicie to digge for the best stone, neither the skill to temper the mortar, nor yet the reason rightly to square the stone, notwithstandyng because my zeale is nothyng inferiour to the chiefe Masons, haue had the will to gather the stones, and lay them by the workemen, now also hopyng that some cunnyng Mason will reache his hand to my heape, and lay of the stones of my gatheryng to the buildyng of this famous tower of health: since I shall conceiue incredible felicitie, if I may hereafter, in viewyng this renowmed buildyng (for so I hope surely to see it) cast myne eye vppon those stones whiche my homely handes had so rudely congested, and see them cunnyngly wrought, and aptly applyed to the buildyng.
            Into which consideration of me I first beseech you (most graue Seniors and Christian brethren) to enter, before you take any occasion to accuse me of temeritie, whiche crime I had worthely incurred if zeale should not mediate my cause, so do I hope, that you will not onely fauour the fruites of my labours, and adde to them your helpyng handes, but also be (in my behalfe) the shield of Pallas, agaynst such Serpentine tounges as duely seeke to prophane of all godly endeuours.
            But to returne to my first determinatiō, whē I had wholly giuē my consent to this end, I might see first a farre of, what sondry & great mutatiōs nature hath vsed in ye body of mā since Galen wrote in Anathomy: and omitting diuers old writers, whose workes had not all equall successe, I came at length to Vesalius, whose whole worke seemed as tedious as his Epitome ouerculled & short. But whē I saw Fuchsius to haue extract a notable Epitome out of Vesalius & Galen, I had thought to looke no further till Collumbus appeared in my sight: whose labours then reuoluyng, and seyng him in some thynges vse sufficient prolixitie, as in his Bookes of Bones and Muscles, & in other causes to be somewhat brief (because Vesalius had sufficiently hādled them) as in the nutritiue partes, immediately I refused to bynde my selfe to any peculiar translation, chusing rather to picke a posie of the chiefest flowers frō all their Gardens, the opinion of Fernelius and others not beyng vtterly refused, as throughout the History is diligently noted.
            And somuch the rather I esteemed this the best, because that way I perceiued I might both more playnly describe the partes to the iudgement of the Reader, as also vse sufficient scope vpon the dissention of Authours in the most notable causes. These considerations vsed, I set foreward in this matter, purposing (to speake briefly) to penne it in fourme of a History, least the Uolume of the

booke should ouer hastely encrease, whereby I might be inhibited to vse requisite prolixitie in conuenient causes.
            And now finally beyng finished, as I may, not as I would, I (the least of the number) do offer the first fruites thereof vnto you, the auncient fraternitie of Chirurgians in London, and conse quently from you, to all Godly, and single professours of the Arte of Chirurgerie, throughout this Realme of England: into whose myndes, I beseech God to inspire the grace of his holy spirite, that we may all (yet at length) with one consent together, endeuour, study, searche, knocke, and call at the gate of Gods mercy, for the guidyng of his holy spirite, that, in all our proceedynges, beyng thereby protected, we may seeke the aduauncement of the glory of God, in healyng our afflicted brethren, whereto his diuine power shall (so oft as it pleaseth him)

            As for you, O ye chaffe of the earth, ye stinge of the Godly, ye Impes of Hell, and children of wrath, you (I say) that, vnder pretence of the sacred Arte of Medicine, deuoure the sheepe of Gods pasture, slea the laboures in his Haruest, and denye your Lord the fruites of the Uineyard: since no warnynges may admonishe you, no exhortation amende you, no lawes bridle you, no punishementes tame you, nor any feare of God sinke into your brestes: behold, all the true professours of Christ Iesus, and who carefully endeuour Godly to discharge their functions, do cry for vengeaunce from heauen vppon you. And I (in these my labours) from the depth of my hart renounce you, hopyng assuredly, that from none of the flowers of this Garden any of you shall take oportunitie to sucke that, whiche may maintaine the infection of your pestilent wretchednesse hereafter. If therefore I haue any where frequented a phrase aboue the common vse of our Englishe language, or vsed woordes litle different from the Latin, esteeme the same to be done onely for your cause, since (as much as in me lyeth) I haue endeuoured euery where, to shade the kernell with a harder shell then you shalbe able to cracke. Away therefore you Uipers. Let these my simple labours, whatsoeuer they are, be entertained in the handes of thee true, vertuous, and honest Artistes, and professours of Chirurgerie, that my expectation may be fulfilled, Arte rightly aduaunced, and God duely worshipped.
            And now returnyng to you agayne (most Godly gouernours, for whose sakes I was most encouraged to perseuer in this enterprise) consideryng your Godly affection towardes me heretofore, and that it hath euer pleased you to esteeme of me, farre more, then the vttermost of my power, at any tyme, may merite, I thought

it not onely the office of pietie, by this meanes, to pricke foreward the myndes of some of the learned sort, but also to commit this vnto you, as a pledge of my vnfeyned zeale to the Arte of Chirurgerie, and consequently to you the chief pillours thereof in this Realme: which, beyng thankefully receiued of your gratefull hartes, may testifie for me, that inwardly I wishe, whiche outwardly I am not able to manifest.
            Haue now therfore this History of Man, picked from the plenty of the most noble Anathomistes aboue named, wherein I haue earnestly, though rudely, endeuoured to set wyde open the closet doore of natures secretes, whereinto euery Godly Artist may safely enter, to see clearely all the partes, and notable deuises of nature in the body of man. From the Female, and that (as I suppose) for sundry good considerations, I haue wholly abstained my pēne: least, shunnyng Charibdis, I should fall into Scylla headlong.

               ❧ THE PROEME.
            
               TYme, the generall rust of the world, which weareth eateth, consumeth, and perforateth all thynges, hath denied that the preceptes of the deuine parentes and progenitours of Phisicke, should for euermore remaine insoluble, or free from all future chaūge: els what should withstand, wherby the workes of Hipocrates and Galene should not suffice all posterities that come after? For what thyng notable haue they not noted? what secret so daintie, that they haue not vncouered yea what misterie so couert, the doore wherof they haue not opened? And yet notwithstandyng, these deuine Oracles haue not taken from posteritie all occasion to write, neither shall the bookes which hitherto are written, do the like to those that come after. But ech age hath his tyme, eche nation his nature, and ech nature his property.
            Albeit, this excellencie we ascribe to Hipocrates and Galen, that neuer any hath bene their equals, and that from their fountaines flow the springyng streames, that nourishe Phisicke for euer. So that what good thing soeuer we haue, or atcheiue, we are to consecrate the same vnto their honor and prayse: and what worke soeuer is published, if the same be worth the reading, we owe it wholly vnto them. What thē (you will say) is the cause, that their workes suffer in these dayes such sundry contradictions, especially in the partes of mans body? It is aunswered a litle before, how that tyme, natures, and nations must be respected.
            For first; that the magnitude of our body is greatly diminished, it is aIac. Sil

Lib. 7. cap. 6. writers, but also that dayly, and (as I suppose) throughout the world, the stature of mā in all pointes decreaseth: especially in those regions: wheras matrimonie is ouer liberally, & before the iust age, permitted. Who is so ignoraunt; to whom the Scriptures haue not ere now testified, how much longer then in these dayes, the age of mā hath bene in times past?Iac. Sil. Ibid. how aboundantly do our bodies testisie, how sondry of the inner partes both in magnitude, number, figure, and situation, do differ from those in others of other regions? neither are the same in all our bodies in these dayes, as, in elder time the auncient Anathomistes most commōly obserued: do not their writynges, and our bodies make it manifest to all liuing? but towhat end? that it might not seeme to vs incredible, that in men of euery region, like as in beastes, yea in the plantes them selues, is either some thyng peculiar from others, or els some certaine mutation from the sirst nature to haue chaunced.
            As, to come first to the exāples of beastes. In Ciria the sheepe haueArist. Lib. 8. hist. ca. 28. tayles a cubite broad, and the goates eares ix. intches in length. What meruaile is it when as the ramme and the ewe, whiche both in Affrica

beare hornes, in Pontus a prouince of Scythia, to haue therfore none at all? As other where sheepe, so in Cilicia goates are clipped. The oxen, sheepe, hartes, and such others, are greater in Aegipt then in Greece: but for that the dogges, wolues, foxes, hares, and hawkes, are greater in Greece thē in Aegipt. Oxē in Scythia through cold possesse no hornes. Oxen in Phrygia haue hornes that are mouable. The Isle Ithaca is destitute of a hare, like as the field called Ager Lebadicus of a moule, and Sardinia of a wolfe.
            If histories be to be beleued, then these are true: if not, what do we with auncient testimonies? why credite we thynges written, or beleue any thyng to be true which our owne eyes haue not witnessed vnto vs? yea let vs reiect the monumentes of our elders, detract their doynges, and wholy obliterate their writynges. And if the bookes of Aristotle, Plinie, and others most famous Historiographers, be worthy to be opened, thē are beastes in Asia, all more cruell, in Europe more stronger, and in Aphrica more diuersly fourmed. But, to speake more appertinēt to the body of man, these aforesayd varieties, obserued of auncient writers, arguyng onely vnto vs, that, as beastes are bred diuersly in eche nation, and accordyng to the nature therof, so to be in men some dissimilitude, & by the same reason, was not denied. Euery one knoweth that the Moores haue onely white teeth, but blacke skinne and nayles. But it is not a thyng so commō that they, and also the inhabitantes of such hoateCor. Cels. Li. 8. ca.

            But, omittyng those natiōs which differ a litle amōg thē selues, let vs come to those which more manifestly vary in figure. In Asia are a people named Macrocephali, hauing very long heades, though first of customeHipochr. de.

For where often mutations of tymes are, and those also much different, truly there also may you finde their fourmes, maners, and natures greatly disagreeyng. The regions wherein tymes and waters are chaunged, or do varie, the bodyes there also do vary: since alway, or for the most part, the maners and fourmes of the people do imitate the nature of the region.

            Much meruailous shall it be to him that vseth dissection, to see such sundry and often varieties: yea, settyng aside monstrous shewes, the Anathomist shall see in his own region, and in few yeares, sundry notes of new shapes in nature, not so straunge now, as worthy the notyng.

            And first (touchyng the Sceleton) in the number of Vertebres: as sometyme sixe in the loynes: sometyme foure, sometyme fiue in Os sacrum: and sometyme three, sometyme one in Cauda. Among the inner partes, I haue obserued the liuer twise deuided into lobes. To the outside and bottome of the matrice I haue found a certaine mole, or masse, white in colour, and hard, or in substaunce Cartilaginous, in fashion like the Testicles, as yet within their purse enuolued: saue that it wayed almost ij. poūd. This bieng cut, cōteined aboundaunce of slimie matter, which at the first brust forth thinner, though at last, very thicke and slimie in deede. Once, in an aged Gentlewoman I searched in vayne for the right vētricle of the hart. And once in the hart of man I foūd a thing notable, and which these before named haue made no mention of, that is, a bone in the hart, situated at the endes of the vessels inserted thereinto, as in the History of Bones I haue more copiously handled. Besides in the same old mā (forso he was in deede a man prest to the groūd with dayes) I saw one of the vrinarie vessels, which, for the space of an intche (or more) in length, had wholly possessed a Cartilaginous substaunce, which seemed still to encrease.
            But here perhappes some are ready to obiect, and say, why what then? do you intend to reiect those authorities which fo oft you haue here alledged, nay, not alledged, but rather out of whose mynes all this treasure is digged? no, but I could wishe with Siluius that euery one might be more zealous to searche the truth, then busie seekers to finde oportunitie agaynst their elders. And those in deede the parentes of all Phisicke. For if in any thyng they disagree from the bodyes of other regions, surely these rehearsed Argumentes are sufficient to proue the same farre more worthy to be imputed to the varieties of regions, and chaunge of tymes, then otherwise, with foule obloquie to spurte our elders, whilest we ourselues in the meane tyme,L

as maleuolent detractours are publiquely denounced. Siluius therfore wisheth him that findeth any thyng otherwise then Galen hath written it, to ascribe the same as a certaine addition to Galens Anathomie, els frendly to admonish the reader therof.
            As for my selfe, I confesse I haue in sundry places cited, and as it were enrolled Galen in sundry errours, yet not by halfe so oft as my authours haue prouoked me? for Vesalius chiefly, and Collumbus (as I suppose) haue spared him in no place. Which hath excited me (frēdly Reader) familiarly thus to warne therof in the begynnyng, that when thou readest them, thou mayest rightly know from whence they come.
            In the meane tyme to come to the matter proposed, I commit to thy diligence in the begynnyng the History of Bones, the frame of the body, wherein (of truth) attentiuenes ought to be vsed, both to carie in mynde, together with thy eye, the direct sense of the present described part, or rather (if it may be) to conferre the same with the Sceleton it selfe, as also because it is an introduction to the whole History of Man, and may be called the keye of knowledge to Anathomie: without the perfectiō wherof, the rest is not onely obscure, but almost vayne at all to read. After the Bones, ensue the Cartilages: then the Ligamēts: after those the Muscles: next the Muscles the nutritiue partes: and next the nutritiue the generatiue partes. Then at length the spirituall members: and finally the animall. To these I haue added a ninth, least (otherwise) the marey, Periosteon, and the heares should haue bene sought in vayne in the History of Man. All these to my power, I haue faythfully, and therewithall sufficient briefly, compiled together. Now resteth no more, but read, and enioye.

               But hopest to helpe the meaner folke. And so, I trust thy payne
               Shall wynne such prayse of skillfull men, as paynfull toyle may craue,

               Then fraught with skill to frame the like, or ought perhaps to mend it.
               But who so ready to controll, or fit to carpe, and clatter,

               What if I meant at leasure more to haue enlargd the same?

               And trauailes great: in hope thereby immortall fame to winne,
               Whose worthy workes do well bewray their paynfull toyle therein.
               I speake not of the famous Greekes, and fathers of the Artes:
               Nor Guidoes workes, nor Vigoes workes that write of other partes:

               As none lookes now to better it, (I thinke) nor euer can.
               Whose lastyng fame no age shall once be able to deface.

               Realdus Collumbus accōpteth not sufficient, the reason I did lately extract frō 
               Galen. Which is, that the vpper iawe should not onely be made of one bone, but of many, lest annoyaūce in one part might bryng disturbaūce to all the rest. ButA second cause why the vpper iawe was not made of one bone onely. also (sayth he) to the end that by beyng made of many, the Ligamentes produced from his Sutures, might enter the construction of the Muscles, to make their begynnyng more firme and sure: in like sort, as in other places, they also are confirmed by the Ligamentes, from Appendances procéedyng.

            To these may be added a xij. and xiij. beyng two spongy fashioned bones collacated on the inside of the nose, where the filth is retained: and these sometyme through erosion (as diuers Practitioners can auouch, their patientes labouryng with the Spanish dissease) fall downe, and are ruined.The Spongie bones in ye nose are easely eaten away with the Spanish dissease.

            I haue (right willyng Reader) in the delineation of these bones, imitated somwhat narrowly the iudgement of Collumbus, because, in the inuention of the vpper iawe bones, he triumpheth ouer all before his time. Neuerthelesse, if any mā of graue iudgement, shall déeme it néedles to contend vpon such scrupulous, and sharpe poynted diuision, as this or in the lyke respect, I will not resist: onely this I say, the truth is to be embraced, and the true inuētor accordyngly reuerenced. Thus, the vpper iawe decyffered, you note how of many bones it is construed, and so, as the right perfect Anathomiste findeth sufficient trauaile to distinguish them aptly.
            In the neither iawe it is nothyng so: for although Galen Lib. iiij. de Anatomicis

            First in their hardnes, which we haue somewhat touched before, necessary to  the Comminution of meate, so be more expeditely done.
            For the second difference I infer their sensibilitie, wherein they excéede them  most notably: the whiche proppertie (as we haue hereafter in our Historie ofHow the teeth are made sensible. Nerues described) they obtaine, by the accesse of certaine Surcles from the thyrd

                   through y• bones of y• Scull and Vertebres giue them no sensibilitie. through them as some do through the Scull and Vertebres, for the transsusion of sense into other partes. Their sensibilitie (notwithstandyng) is not to be attributed to their vniuersall partes, as those also that are already in sight, and prominent forth of the Goummes: for such places of the téeth Collumbus proueth (by theHow much of y• tooth hath sense. Why y• part with in the Bumes feleth. testimony of his samiliar Iho. Baptista Mazzolarius) to be voyde of sense, and so much as is infixed within the Goummes to be perfect sensible, by vertue of the Nerue extended to that region. Wherfore their Assertions are odious, and most lothsome to aunswere, who fantastically fayne, that all Bones are sensible, or els the téeth also destitute of any feelyng: as though it were asmuch requisite for the Solid partes of the body, and such as, no otherwise then the frame worke of a house, do supporte, the other members should retaine as delicate sense as other partes & Organs of the body, whose functions without the same, were frustrate, for who knoweth not (as I haue also other where said) how incōmodious a thingThat it behoued not the bones to feele. it were, if the sense of féelyng should be imparted to the bones: whilest so no man might endure halfe the vigour of his bodyes motion, without intollerable payne in all partes. Contrariwise, who doteth so much as that he will not know, theThat the teeth haue sense necessarily. transfusion of sense into the téeth to be necessarily taken: that thereby they might reueale vnto the common wittes eche outward, or inward annoyaunce, which might corrupt or destroye their propper substaunce, either by eruption, erosion, heat, or cold, consideryng how needfull they are to susteine nature, and howHow y• teeth are decayed. necessary to the comly fourme of the countenaunce. And we sée it hapneth (many tymes) that they are ruined, by such cruciable tormentes of Rheumaticke incursions, or other like affectes, that no Medicin may preuayle to procure the patiēts ease, till the same dolorous tooth be extirped & plucked vp by the rootes: at which seperation, and departyng from the sensible Surcles or twigges of the Sinewe aforesayd,It Nerues be inserted to y• rootes of the teeth, they must needes haue sense. how paynfull it is, I referre it to the sentence of them that haue tasted the bitternes therof. And if any man will wilfully runne in such absurditie, as that he will deny the insertiō of Nerues within the rootes of the téeth, to be of nature ordained for any purpose, let him still lye drownd in dreamyng doubtes, till his senses be sopt in solitarie sobbes, to pine in powting, as the Poete feyneth the transformation of Crgnus into the shape of a Swanne: for none are so obstinateQuid.

                   of the wrest. iudged, and knowne, by their number, and order: which is after this sort.
            The first bone of the wrest is that, which appeareth vnto vs in the inner side  of the first ranke, towardes the thombe.
            The second succéedeth the first.
            
            The thyrd, is with the second coherent, at the outer side towardes the litle finger, or cubit.
            The fourth and least of all is knit vnto the thyrd.
            
            The fift is the first of the second ranke, and next vnto the thombe.
            
            And so thence the vj. vij. and viij. do follow in order.
            
            And thus, as you sée in number, and figure, they are different, so also in greatnes, and litlenes. For the greatest of all are the first, and vij. of which ij. it is hard to iudge the greatest: the second is lesse thē these but bigger then all the remnaūt: then chalengeth the viij. and after him the fift, the sixt next, so then the thyrd: the fourth of all others (as we sayd before) is least.
            Now as touchyng their vnion, & order of composition: which ought aswell toThe vnion of the brachiall bones. be knowen, and considered, as all that we haue hetherto, spoken of them.
            The first bone therfore (besides that it is articulate with Radius,) in the superiour  part therof, where it proturberateth round, cleaueth to the second, entryng the cauitie therof, and admitteth into it the round head of the seuenth: as also in the inferiour part, is coherent with the v. and vj.
            The second, not onely vpward, entreth the hollow of Radius together with the  the first, but in the inferiour part, where it is hollow, is connected with the vij. and in the posteriour part with the thyrd.
            So likewise the thyrd is ioyned with the secōd, and in the lower side toucheth  the viij. and in the hinder part inwardly, towardes Vlna, meteth the fourth.
            The which fourth we finde committed to none other.
            
            The fift next, in the vpper part with the first, in the hinder part with the vj. &  is adherent to the prominent Processe of the second bone of Postbrachiale, (if by the way, we constitute, as Collumbus would, v. bones thereto, wherof more hereafter) the inferiour portiō therof the first bone of Postbrachiale, which Galen makethGalen. the first ioynt of the thombe, receiueth.
            The vj. is knit to the first, fift, & seuenth, on that side where it respecteth them: but with ye inferiour head, or swelling, it is fastened to the angular bosome of the Postbrachiall bones, from thence respecting the thyrd also of Postbrachiale, whose first, and longer produced portion it susteyneth.
            The seuenth endeth at the first, second, sixt, and vi

            Lastly the viij. which is highest, on the other sides is coupled with the second, thyrd, and vij. and in the inferiour part, it is a seate vnto the fourth, and fift bonesThe bones of the wrest haue obscure mouing. of Postbrachiale: to which also it is coarticulated, and knit.

            The thyrd hath also a hollow end, & in the inner part, towardes the thombe, stretcheth forth as it were a Processe, whose face, or outer border is setled to the vj. bone of the wrest. The rēnaunt of his Sinewes, or hollowed head, admitteth the viij. Bone.
            The head of the fourth is foure squared, beyng ioyned with ij. bones: that is, part to the seuenth, and part to the viij. those partes beyng also flat, aunswerable to their squarenes: but somewhat inward decliued with all.
            The last hath likewise a foure squared head, but somewhat toward the outer  partes tendyng, and cleanyng also to the extreme portion of the viij. and last bone of the wrest.

The Fibres of these Muscles are no where straight as Vesalius holdeth, but oblique, that is to say from the toppe of the nose towardes the temples, and their action is to lift vp eye browes: although neither Galen so well deseruyng in the Art of Medicine, nor yet Vesalius in our tyme a man of great name in the Art of dissectyng, neither any that write before me haue acknowledged it.

Whiche contraction of the forehead might by noThere are ij. muscles of the forehead and not one onely. meanes be, if there were but one Muscle onely.

            Furthermore of these vi. Muscles the first iiij. euen as they yeld straight motions

                  . 2. Cap. 11 to the eye, euē so are their seates accordyngly set straight, and all ech where answerable one to an other. The heades of them haue their begynnyng, as from the hard Membran of the brayne, coueryng the visible Nerue, and from the Sinew of the second payse of the brayne, immediatly after the commyng forth of the visible Nerue out of the Scule. Moreouer their belly is more ample and large, then déepe and profound, yet in sight is most round, lying to the posteriour region of the eye and visible Nerue, after the longitude of it in goyng from the Scule vnto the roote of the eye: and whereas the same belly approcheth neare the middle seate of the eye where it is broadest, there it maketh an end with a broad Membraneous eneruation. Which is in déede beyond the middle part of the eye, and directed to the hard tunicle therof, like as if it were to the mouing of a bone: but beyng brought after the longitude of the body of the eye: it is setled to the line neare Iris or the greater circle of eye, as in the former part of the eye appeareth separatyng the blacke from the white.
            Agayne, the Muscles of circumduction, or they that lead the eye about are in fashion lyke to the first, and also in begynnyng, yet lesse, and in the manner of their situation and insertion differyng from them. For the first hath his begynnyng from Dura Membrana clothyng the visible Nerue from the region of the lesser corner, and is inserted to the lower seate of the eye with his sinewy thinnes, and with an oblique lyne neare to Iris after the manner of the rest. The other spryngeth from the Membran of the visible Nerue, out of the region of the greater angle of the eye, and sustayneth his sinewie tenuitie to the hard tunicle of the eye, with a more 
                  〈◊〉
                lyne, at the vpper seate of the eye. Hereby it appeareth, that the Muscles of the eye do varie among them selues onely in situation, and by insertion to the hard tunicle of the eye. For the iiij. first (as is sayd)

are wholly straight, and with a more strayght line inserted. The other ij. more crosse, or slopwise, attempt their insertion with an oblique line. Which although they are auayleable for circumuertion, yet besides they moue the eye both vpward and downward.
            Further those Muscles together whilest yet they obserue their propper place, are reckned in figure like a Peare made sharpe beneath and broad aboue: whose sharpe end is their begynning, but the broad part or seat, their insertion. In their short space they are knit together to the visible Nerue, conteyning in the capacitie (which by méetyng together they make) much hard fatte, which other where, in the description of the eyes we haue spoken of at large. Briefly all these sayd sixe Muscles, produced from the hard Membran of the brayne, coueryng the visible Nerue, or in compassed sort inserted with Membraneous tendons in the anterior seat of the hard tunicle, neare to the sides of Iris. The first therfore, which is in the great corner, draweth the eye inward towardes the nose: the second lying in the lesser angle, leadeth the eye there towardes: the thyrd lying beneath, bringeth it downewardes: the fourth aboue, toward the eye browes: and the fift, and sixt circumuerte, and turne the eye about ech way.
            Besides those vj Muscles, there is yet an other great one hid on ech side byGalen. Ibid the others, and compassed about with the aforesayd fat. This sheweth the same likenesse that the other vj. do figure together: for from the hard Membran mouyng the visible Nerue, it hath his begynnyng, but somewhat more forward thē the first sixe. His begynnyng is fleshie, as the rest of the bodye therof, that round compasseth the visible Nerue, and beyng stretched forth from the begynnyng to the foure partes like a Peare or pine apple, increaseth, and enlargeth by litle and litle untill it touch the posterior part of the eye, whereto it is emplanted as a circle. Neither doth it assay this insertion neare this visible Nerue, but almost where the eye begynneth to encrease the largest. This Muscle lifteth the eye vpward, and downward, and therewithall turneth it.
            
               Netherto (as briefly as I might) thou hast to consider of the Muscles of the eyes, abstract sensibly from Galen, Uesalius,
                   and the rest of Anathomistes,

                and in a strong tendon, fastned to the sharpe Processe of the nether iawe called Coronon, which tendon begynneth sufficient déepe, and inwardes. There is beside an other Membraneous tēdon, which maketh the exteriour part of the Muscle blacke, & is caried vnder the Iugal bone. This Muscle hath one office, that is to shut the inferiour iawe, & the Fibres of it runne from the outer borders to theA

The Fibres therof are strayght, hauyng likewise a tendon strong sufficiently, which is endewed with the same office as the temporall Muscle, and is thick and short.
            The third Muscle is that which is called Massetores or Mansorius, which moueth

It hath both a fleshy & tendinous begynnyng, but the end in the inferior iawe is almost iij. cornered. Furthermore it cleaueth to the sharpe Processe of the same, where it séemeth to ioyne with the temporall bone. This hath diuers Fibres, and therfore moueth the iawe forward, backeward, to the sides, and in compassed sort, beyng of it selfe sufficient thicke.

Nature made not this so thicke, as thoseWhy nature made not the Muscle to open the mouth so large as those to shutte it. that are chosen for the shuttyng of the iawe. For those two muscles of the iawe beyng relaxed, which we haue sayd to be sited aboue on both sides, by reason that the nature therof is sufficiēt heauy it enclineth or falleth downward, easely therfore contented with a smaller muscle to open, then were behofull to shut. But the middle part therof is made as a tēdon, least it should take to great a rowme: for the place was streite hauyng therein many organs placed. To conclude, this muscle, when it is gathered together of it selfe, the mouth thereby openeth, and it is therfore the Author, of mouing ye nether iawe to the inferior partes, as is sayd.

There Fibres are straight, the Muscles them selues round, and it appertaineth to their office to thrust out the toung beyond the téeth and lippes. Neither is it any miracle (as some suppose) that the tounge can doe this without the helpe of any Muscle.
            The fift, and sixt are sclender, begynnyng at the Processe Styloides,
                and end  in the sides of the roote of the toung. These haue power whilest both labour, to draw the toung towardes them selues, but one onely mouyng, draweth it vp to a side.
            The vij. and viij. go forth from the Processes of Hyoides, and are inserted to the  sides of the tongue: seruyng to draw it downwardes.
            But the ix. and x. rise from the iaw, and are fixed to the sides therof. And haue  propertie now hether now thether to impell and moue the tongue, when we eate, or swallow.
            The last muscle is more rightly to be called a consused muscle of flesh, fat, and  glandulous matter together, then truely a muscle. It is put in the roote of the tongue, and is brought from Hyoides. Beyng in eatyng pleasaunt and swéete: asThe

            Besides the xi.

The like negligence is imputed vnto him, where he describeth the eyes, which in man (although the more difficult) Collumbus protesteth onely to haue followed. Wherefore these be his wordes.

                of the shoulder, and springeth from the second, thyrd, fourth, and fift, but seldome from the vj. ribbe, and endeth at the lesser Processe of the scaple called Ancyroides, both fleshy, and tendinous. Nature begat it to this vse, that by meanes therof the scaple bone might moue forwardly towardes the brest bone Sternon:Collumbus Ibid. but is nothyng seruiceable to the shoulder, what soeuer Galen thought therin.
            The thyrd Muscle is reached from the ouerthwarte Processe of the second, thyrd, fourth, and fift Vertebre of the necke: and as it fleshy descendeth, so it warethBy the benefitte of the third Muscle the shoulder blade is lifted vp. thicker and strōger, and finally is inserted to the vpper and inner part of the scaple: almost all the Fibres therof are straight, except a few that stād obliquely,

or stopwise. And this is vsed to lift vp the shoulder blade, and to giue helpe vnto the first. For great and heauy is the scaple bone.
            The fourth is a broad Muscle thine, and fowersquare, brought from the ridge  of the fist, sixt, and seuenth Vertebres of the necke, and from the iiij. vppermost of the brest: it beginneth fleshy, and parteth tendinous, with oblique Fibres: the ende therof is after the hole longitude of the shoulder blade, which is therby caried backwardes.

The begynnyng hereof is large and great, but it euer after diminisheth, and at length endeth at a Tendon short and broad: which is inserted in the anteriour part of the shoulder vnder the necke therof. This Muscle hath diuers Fibres, and therfore leadeth the shoulder diuersly vnto the brest, that is to say, higher, lower, and in the middest betwene both. Galen supposed thisThis Muscle is not to be deuided into 4. as Galen would. muscle to be deuided in iiij. but that is denyed, albeit somtyme that in the nether part therof (as sayth Collumbus) a certaine portion sharpe stretching out, is foūd in some men as though it were a muscle, when as in déede it is none. But (sayth the same Author) to this absurditie he hath added another more absurd, by thinckyng the arme to be moued obliquely by meanes therof: which in Apes, and not in man is proued true.
            The second muscle of the shoulder is iij. square, thicke, and intertexed with  diuers Fibres, and is called by Anathomistes

It springeth out of the middest of the Cannell bone, from Acromion, and the whole great Processe of the shoulder blade: it hath a broad and tendinous begynnyng, but the end of it is sharpe: it is caried aboue the head of the shoulder, and endeth in the middest of the shoulder at a strong and ouerthwarte tendon, which

               ēdon embraceth the middle thicknesse of ye shoulder: it consisseth of many Fibres, wherewith the arme is lifted aboue, forward, in the middest, and backward.
            But the thyrd muscle of the shoulder is carneous and round, which from the  inferiour part of the shoulder blade goeth forth which a fleshy begynnyng, with Fibres straight, from the begynnyng vnto the very end: & beyng situated obliquely, goeth foreward aboue the anteriour and bounched part of the shoulder blade, and goeth out into a broad and strong tendon, which planteth it selfe in the posteriour part of the shoulder: and it is the part of this muscle to draw the arme downward towardes the posteriour partes.
            The fourth muscle is great and broadest begynnyng at the poynt of the ridge  of the vj.

               The fift Muscle occupieth all that cauitie whiche is betwixt the toppe of the  shoulder blade, and the greater Processe therof, springyng from the posteriour part of it. It is fleshy, and endeth at a strong tendon, whilest it is caried vnder the Ligament that knitteth the shoulder and the scaple bone together. It endeth in the head of the vpper part of the shoulder, much cleauyng also to the shoulder blade it selfe.

Their Fibres are straight from the begynnyng, vntill they come to the place where ye 
               Muscles are deuided: but afterwardes as they stretch vpward, so farre their race is a slope, or oblique, and sufficient fleshy are these Muscles. Their office is whē both labor with one cōsent together, that ye head might be drawne backewardes to the posteriour partes, but when the one worketh onely, then is the head compassingly turned to the one side. To those Muscles are thrée sides, one from the begynnyng to the place whereas he is deuided from his fellow, an other from thence to the hinder part of the head, and the thyrd from the hinder part of the head vnto their beginning.
            The second Muscles are diuers, because they haue diuers figures and impressions, consisting of many partes tendinous, and very many fleshy: so that some suppose them to be fiue Muscles. Although in déede it is but one payre, as one

would say the right, and the left. They spryng with a sharpe beginning from the transuerse, or ouerthwarte Processe of the fourth and fift Spondiles of the brest, and ascendyng vpward, are at length fastned in the middest of the hinder part of the head. Their situation is directly strayght, & their office is to draw the head to the posteriour part strayght.
            The thyrd Muscles are sclender, whiche spryng from the ridge of the second  
               Vertebre of the necke, and end at length in Occciput, which is the hindermost bone of the head, but by the way, they go somewhat disioyned. The Fibres which they possesse are straight, therfore do they lead the head directly backewardes.
            The fourth Muscles are hidden vnder the thyrd, and are all fleshy euen as the  thyrd, but short, and spryng from the posteriour part of the first Vertebre, where should haue bene a ridge or Spine vnto the same Vertebre, but that nature tooke it away because it might be no impediment or greuaunce vnto the essence of the thyrd Muscles. In the middest of Occiput is their end, and their office is to draw likewise the head backewardes directly. Neither is it any maruaile, why nature ordained so many Muscles onely to draw the head backwardes, for so it was necessary:Why nature appoynted so many Muscles to the drawing of the head backward. since the Anteriour part of the head is much more heauy because thereto is ioyned both the face and nether iawe. Whereby the forepart becommeth of right heauyer then the hinder.
            In oblique sort are situated the fift payre of Muscles mouyng the head beyng  risen from the Spinc of the secōd Vertebre, and ended in the ouerthr warte Processe of the first. These Muscles are sclender and all fleshy, seruyng to pull the head in round compasse together with the first Vertebre.
            
            The vi. are also oblique, but cōtrary wayes they make ye fourme of a triāgle, & they begyn at the Processe of ye first Vertebre, so do they end in ye hinmost bone (Occiput) of the head, and that in the middest: these draw to the fore partes.
            So these ij. last recited the v. & the vj. are the proper Muscles which moue the head roūd or in compassed sort, by the helpe of ye first Muscles, and the last which yet are to describe. But now therfore they whiche are in the vij. place are long. round, and strong, sited obliquely. Their Fibres spring from the toppe of the brest and Cannell bone. They haue ij. begynnynges, betwene which lyeth a concauitie, or spare hollow. They are sinewie and broad in their begynning, after also fleshy, and are planted to the Mammillar Processe, which they imbrace. When both of them labor, the head enclineth forward, but as oft as onely one of them moueth, the head goeth to the side. They are further very strong, and able also to how the head directly downward. But this more ouer is to be noted, that theseWhat Muscles doe make a crosse in the head.

Vertebre of the brest, and ascendyng vpwardes also from the other trāsuerse Processes of the Vertebres of the brest, are at length knit to all the Processes of the Vertebres of the necke, in ye posteriour part. Their office is the like with the second before named, that is, to bow the necke directly to the shoulder blades, or sides: as when both of them moue at one tyme: but onely, styrreth it obliquely. Betwene these two Muscles go forth the Nerues, produced from the Spinall marey, betwixt the Vertebres of the necke.
            The fourth begynnyng at the vij. Vertebre of the brest, goyng aboue all the  ridge or Spines of the brest, and necke, do at last end at the Spine of the second Vertebre of the necke, and ordained they were to the drawyng of the necke to the posteriour partes.

            The first come from the superiour cauitie and the posteriour part of the bone

Their begynning is broad, and fleshy, ascendyng in the inner part of Abdomen, and cleaue to the transuerse Processes of the Vertebres of the loynes, and to the lower ribbes: theyTheir vse. are all fleshy, and in figure foure square: and when both of these moue together, they can bow the backe forward, but seuerally laboryng, do draw it to a side.
            The second Muscles are longer then all the Muscles of our body. For they are  extended from the lower part of Os sacrum euen vp to the head: their originall is from the extreme part of Os sacrum, with a sinewy begynnyng and strong, then after degenerate into flesh, and cleaue to the trāsuerse Processes of the Vertebres of the loynes, towardes the posteriour part, afterwardes to all the transuerse Processes of the Vertebres of the brest, euen vnto the first, to all which trāsuerse Processes they send a tendon or sinewy hold, in which place Vesalius supposed this Muscle to end, but departyng from those Processes, and ascendyng aboue the Mammillar Processe, it endeth in the temporall bone: which part Uesalius

In the beginning it is broad, sinewy, & Membraneous, but after becommeth fleshy, & endeth in the iij. last ribbes, after the maner of fingers: so can they dilate those ribbes.

But the matter is playnly otherwise. For it is styrred by the first Muscle of the brest, which springeth from the Cannell bone: so that when it is lifted vp,How the ribbes are moued. it draweth the ribbes after in order: whereto the Intercostall muscles are assistaunt: and so they are outward extended, the exteriour Muscles helpyng them: but downeward contrarily by the helpe of the inferiours. For because the last ribbe is drawne downward by the oblique ascendent Muscle of Abdomen: And after this order aforesayd they are dilated. Notwithstandyng when that both do worke together, that is the outer and inner, then followeth construction of thē brest generally, as somewhat before is written.

            The thyrd Muscle of the thighe lureketh vnder the second whole, beyng also  blacke, and begynnyng fleshy, and in circle wise. It goeth from Os Ilium, and as is sayd of other two in his progresse it diminisheth, ceassing at a tendon, which to the sayd great Processe is knit, and that in the inner poynt thereof, where it is somewhat inuerted.
            These iij. Muscles haue the office to extend & stretch out the thigh, to attract,The vse of these iiij. Muscles. and draw it vpwardes, as also to lead it to the exteriour partes.
            The fourth hath an oblique situation, and springeth from the iij. lower hones  of Os sacrum, with a fleshy (as it séemeth) and round begynnyng. The end of it is at a round tendon, which in the toppe of the greater Processe toward the posteriour partes endeth, and drawing the thigh to him selfe, hath also power to helpe the circumaction therof.
            The fift Muscle is of the loynes sited in Abdomen, beyng round, fleshy, thicke  and strong, sited somewhat oblique, and all blacke: his beginnyng is taken from the xi. and xi

            The vi. Muscle occupyeth all the whole inner hollow part of Os Iliū: it begynneth  from the whole Appendance therof, beyng placed in Abdomen with a semicircular rising: it descendeth aboue Os pubis, and is fleshy almost to the extreme

His begynnyng is broad and fleshy, it goeth forth toward the exteriour part, lyeth ouerthwartly, and alway becommeth narrower: so that at length it stretcheth forth into a strong tendon to be fastened in a certaine cauitie, in the great Trochanter apparaunt.
            The tenth and last Muscle of the thigh is in the interiour part, and the aforesayd  hole it likewise occupyeth. This Muscle (sayth Collumbus) is not onely not to be neglected, but chiefly, and most especially to be marked, for it is marueilous therein to contemplate the great prouidence of the high creator.

the hamme which geueth oblique mouing. And this one Vesalius imagined if it doThe motions of ye legge are made by ten muscles. any thyng, that it doth imitate the motion of the first muscle that moueth Radius directly downeward. For it beyng sited obliquely could not haue or make any straight motion: and because he had denyed oblique mouyng to the legge I omit to say he would not acknowledge the right office of it. But surely he hath left the vse therof to be of other more aptly described, as appeareth by that is sayd. Wher fore so much the rather I giue credite vnto Collumbus, and to his assertion as touchyng this oblique motion.
            The first of these Muscles riseth both sinewy, & also fleshy frō the inner part of  ye 
               Appendance of Os Iliū, but forthwith goeth forward sleshy, broad, & thinne like a swadle band, & slopwise is delated by the interiour partes of the thigh, but whē it cōmeth to the inner head of ye thigh, it proceedeth, & at a sinewy tēdon is ended, which is not round (sayth Collumbus) as Vesalius would, but broader, & fastened in the fore part of the legge. He also reprehēdeth Galen (vnles his meanyng was onely of Apes) in that he affirmeth, by the benefite of this muscle that one legge is layd vpon an other, as children haue occasion to do in playing.
            But to go forward, the second muscle of the legge springeth from the anteriour  part neare the Cartilage of Os pubis, the beginnyng therof beyng broad, after the length of Os pubis commissure: it descendeth fleshy, with straight Fibres, at the interiour head of the thigh made round, and ceaseth at a sinewy tendon, also almost round: notwithstandyng it is furthermore dilated, and at length ended in the fore part of the legge.
            The thyrd with a sinewy begynnyng long, and also round, springeth from the  lower part of the Appendance of Coxēdix, beyng made fleshy afterwardes about the middest of the thigh, and is caried downe by the hinder part of the thigh, with many sortes of Fibres: but commyng to the knée, it maketh a sinewy tendon, wherewith it is implanted to the posteriour but interiour part of the legge.
            The fourth from the same place begynneth neare vnto the thyrd, but the be, gynnyng is both fleshy, and sinewy, and descendeth downward by the posteriour partes of the thigh with straight Fibres. Neare vnto the knee it goeth out in a sinewy tendon, which before the end is dilated, and ceasseth at length in the Anteriour part of the legge betwene the first and second.
            The begynnyng of the fift is from the Appendaunce of Coxendix neare vnto  the thyrd and fourth, sharpe at first, then after thicker, and marcheth forward by the posteriour but exteriour part of the thigh. But where it hath wonne the middest of the thigh (a thyng worthy to behold and note) it obtaineth a heape of flesh, springyng from the middest of the thigh, whiche least any body should imagine to be another Muscle, Collumbus
                assureth vs it is not separable from this fift Muscle neither to be accompted one distinct Muscle from it. Neuerthelesse if any man will call the same fleshy part of the fift Muscle an other new Muscle. He supposeth it sufficient to haue admonished vs of his iudgment. In the same place it begynneth outwardly to degenerate into a tendon, which together with the aforesayd flesh descendeth euen to the end, and in the end is collocated in the head of Fibula. If the cause be inquired why nature added to this Muscle this portion of flesh, Collumbus sayth, that to the end this Muscle might he made the stronger, Nature would that it should come from the middest of the thigh to be the nearerThe vse of yt

            Now, to the extensiōs therof there be iiij. in number seruiccable. The vj. muscle  therfore of the legge springeth from the middest of the Appendaunce of Os Ilium both fleshy, & also siuewy in the begynnyng.

This tēdon truly is of great nobilitie, much therfore to be marked of Chirurgians, least at any tyme trāsuersly they deuide it. It complecteth the rotule of the knee, and to the Anteriour part of the legge, and Fibula is at length inserted.

            The second goeth forth with a sharpe begynnyng from the Appendaunce of  
               Tibia, and cleaueth to the Ligament that lyeth (as is sayd) betwene Tibia and Fibula. Moreouer at the end almost of this same Fibula, the roote of this Muscle is fleshy: notwithstandyng it endeth in foure round Tendons, which are detayned vnder that Ligament, that riseth out from the Appendance of Tibia, and Fibula.

                  g the foure toes. These foure Tendons are enlarged, and at last inserted to the vpper part in all the toes of the foote, the great one excepted. So that they can extend, and stretch forth these toes.
            The thyrd springeth fleshy from the middest of Fibula, neare vnto the Ligament:
                then after degenerateth into a round tendon, which is also vnder the ouerthwart Ligament, caried and inserted to the last ioynt of the great toe, which it doth extend. This tendon is into ij. deuided, whereof the one endeth as aforesayd, the other is inserted in the same bone of the plant, yeldyng helpe to the bowyng of the foote. This second tendon springeth also from the muscle: which portion in some seldome bodyes séemeth to be an other Muscle, as some perhappes will suppose. But Collumbus affirmeth it to be but onely one. Neuerthelesse he forceth

            The fourth springeth from the vpper Appendance of Fibula towardes the exteriour  partes: it consisteth in the begynnyng both of fleshy, & sinewy substaunce, but is made fleshy afterward: lastly it putteth out a round tendon, and vnder the sole of the foote his endes are cōmitted to the bones of the plant. This Muscle turneth the foote to the exteriour partes & consisteth vnder the transuerse Ligament.
            
            The fift likewise brusteth forth of Fibula, with a long begynnyng, outward it  is fleshy, euen as is sayd before of the fourth, and it marcheth on vnder the outer ancle, where together with the fourth it finisheth at a round tendon: and is inserted to the bone of the plant, that is put before the litle toe. So by meanes of this Muscle, the foote is drawne to the exteriour partes.

The other beginnyng of this Muscle, goeth out frō the Processe called Ancyroides, partly sinewy, & partly also fleshy: but the fleshy part cleaueth to the shoulder, and séemeth a distinct muscle, & separated, which yeldeth helpe vnto the shoulder, since therby he is drawne towardes the brest. Furthermore these ij. beginninges of the sayd Muscle are vnited vnder the head of the shoulder together, makyng athicke Muscle and almost roūd, strong, and filled with straight Fibres, which in the elbowe leaueth at a sinewy Tendon, which neare to the end is dilated, and knit to Radius, who hath in the inside therof a Tubercle, made propperly for the insertion of this Muscle.
            
            The ij. Muscle from the hone of the shoulder is caried all fleshy, with straight  
               Fibres, and lyeth hid vnder the first Muscle. It is caried fleshy beyond the ioynte of the cubite, and lastly fastened to Cubitus, and Radius. And the cubite by the vtilitie of these two Muscles, is made directly to bow.
            The thyrd is produced from the shoulder blade a litle vnder the necke therof &  is caried by the hinder partes of the shoulder: it is together with a broad tēdon, & beyng fleshy, stretcheth his tendon to the posteriour Processe of Vlna called the elbow: and also goeth beyond the same. And straight be the Fibres of this Muscle.
            
            The fourth hath two begynnynges from the necke of the shoulder, whereto it  cleaueth much, and is so ioyned together with the thyrd, as that the thyrd and fourth séemeth one onely Muscle, with many begynnynges: albeit in déede they are ij: finally this fourth Muscle endeth where the thyrd, hauyng also straight Fibres. And the office both of the thyrd, and fourth Muscle is to extend, and stretch forth the cubite straight.

The true vse of this Muscle, is to helpe the fingers in bowyng, and being exquisite of sense, what soeuer we therfore comprehend,This Muscle maketh not the ball of the hand without heare. or gripe in the hand that offereth vs any present hurt, (for in a moment we know it, by the sensibilitie therof) we cast away, and immediatly auoyde it from vs, before it procéede further to hurt vs. Neither is it made to that end, as that theCol. ibid.

                  : our muscle of the hand. ball of the hand therfore should be without heare, as some would imagine, for Collumbus writeth of certaine théeues which had not this Muscle, but onely a tendon brought from the inner Ligament of the wrest.
            The second goeth forth from the inner tubercle of the shoulder, tēdyng sharpe in the first begynnyng, both sinewy, and fleshy, it cleaueth fast to the cubite, and  marcheth after the length of it vnto the roote of the wrest: and is vnto the cubite as a soft bed, or bowlster: but first at the commyng therof to the wrest, it degenerateth into a Tendon, and both with a fleshy, and sinewy end is implanted to the fourth bone of the wrest of the hand.
            The thyrd Muscle begynneth at the same place, with an oblique progresse after  the length of Radius: yet in commyng likewise to the wrest, it goeth out into a round, and strong Tendon, which is inserted to that of the Postbrachiall bones that supporteth the litle finger. The office of these two Muscles is, that, if both moue at once, they bowe the wrest, but when one alone styrreth, then doth it moue obliquely, now vp, now downe, by the helpe notwithstandyng of two exteriour Muscles, as we shall come vnto anone.
            The fourth hath a marueilous beginning. For it springeth sharpe and sinewy  from the inner Tubercle of the shoulder, so that it becōmeth afterward fleshy: & is caried longwise after Cubitus, & Radius. After, when it hath passed the middest of the cubit, it stretcheth out narrow, & is ended in iiij. round tendons, sinewy, & perforated, which are brought vnder the Ligament of the wrest, vnder which neuertheles the iij. first Muscles are not caried. The end of these tēdōs is in yt secōd ioynt of the iiij. fingers, which they serue to bow: & because they were to be penetratedThe perforated tendons of the hand. by the tēdons of the v. Muscle, goyng to the iij. ioynt of the foure fingers as shalbe sayd, therfore nature perforated these: which be sinewy, fayre, & shynning: a thing notable and marueilous to behold. This prudent nature also wrought, to the end that the fingers after a certaine order should follow one an other.
            The fift Muscle is much stronger then the fourth, and no meruaile: for that it  behoued it to moue after, & with greater force, since it boweth the foure fingers, excellētly constrayning them together. It springeth neare the fourth, but (for the most part) frō the vpper and interiour part of the cubit. It lyeth vnder the fourth Muscle, and straitnyng by litle, and litle, cleaueth to the cubit, before it come vnto the wrest: at last it goeth forth in iiij. rownd, sinewy, and perforating tendons,The 4. perforating tendons of the hand. whiche finally are inserted to the thyrd ioynt of the foure fingers, the thombe in déede being exempted, contrary to Galens mynde, who would haue the v. fingersGal.

For the thombe in man is moued by his propper Muscle, as shalbe sayd. This fift (moreouer) cleaneth to the Ligament which deuideth the inferiour from the posteriour muscles.
            The vj. springeth from Radius beyng likewise adherent to the same Ligamēt and iourneth downe along the length of Radius, endyng neare the wrest at a

            The seuenth Muscle with a fleshy begynnyng commeth from the inner Tubercle  of the shoulder, and from the vpper, and inner part of the cubit. It créepeth obliquely, and in the halfe space of the length of Radius endeth partly fleshy, partly sinewy, with oblique Fibres.

            The second Muscle begynneth at the same Tubercle neare to the first with a  sharpe begynnyng, and sinewy, so it is borne forward betwene the first Muscle, and cubit after the longitude therof towardes the wrest, but it endeth at a round, sinewy, and sometyme double Tendon.

            The thyrd Muscle goeth out fleshy from the middle, very neare, of Cubitus, in  what place of Cubitus is a long roughe lyne, made to giue begynnyng to thrée Muscles. The situation of this is oblique, and the end at a roūd Tendon, which is inserted to the fore finger to extend, and stretch forth the same obliquely. But this sayd Tendon chuseth a Ligament from the Appendance of Radius, and this Tendon is deuided in some, into two.
            The fourth Muscle with a fleshy begynnyng from the cubite neare vnto the  thyrd, is oblique, and caried aboue the Appendance of Radius, then endyng at a round, and sinewy tendon, is to the thyrd ioynt of the thombe, to extend, and lead the same from the other fingers, inserted.
            The fift from the same lyne of Cubitus, neare to the fourth Muscle, with a fleshy  begynnyng, and long, marcheth obliquely towardes the thombe, with many inscriptions, and ceaseth at diuers Tendons. Wherfore (sayth Collumbus) he that deliteth in the multitude of Muscles, may deuide this into thrée or iiij, albeit he iudgeth it onely one: which is caried aboue the ij. horned Muscle.

But where the iiij. braunches of the two Nerues do touch the vpper Orifice of the vētricle, with diuers orders of braunchynges they embrace it, reachyng straight downward surcles, with notable space betwene.
            From the left Nerue of the vj. payre embracing the right region of the mouth of the ventricle, a certaine notable braunch, after the higher side of the ventricle euen to the lower Orifice thereof, is deduced: which albeit that in the progresse therof it poureth out portions, and enwrappeth the nether Orifice of the ventricle with some surcles, yet is it not there wholly wasted, vntill further it haue crept into the hollow of the liuer.

            This notable arme whiche a litle before we haue mentioned after it passed ouer the flanke, it goeth forth in thrée partes, wherof one descendeth obliquely inward towardes the knée betwene the skinne and sleshy Membran, and aboue it on the inside descendyng through the legge, trauaileth aboue the inner ankle, and vpon the foote towardes the toes, especially the great toe where it is diuersly bestowed.The veyne called Saphena.

Under the same bought of the knee an other veyne breaketh out, which nourisheth the Anteriour Muscles of the legge; and an other also deeper: thus beyng caryed downward, it cleaueth to the Ligament sited betwene Tibia & Fibula, which it perforateth, creeping to the Anteriour partes of the legge, and descendyng aboue the foote, is with the Ligament therof coherent.

            But whē as the whay of bloud ought by the reynes to be strayned out, because they might not so fitly grow to the bodyes of the hollow veyne and great Arterie, as the liuer it selfe vnto the hollow veyne, therfore notable braūches are broughtDeynes offred to the kidneis. from the veyne and Arterie vnto them. And from the hollow veyne two great armes are reached, that is to say, ech of them to ether of the reynes, which breake not out one directly agaynst an other, but alway the one higher then the other accordyng to the situation of the reynes, and these are commonly called the Emulgent veynes. The like reason is of the Arteries, which beyng reached out vnderWhich are the Emulgent veynes.

            Immediately, and so soone as the veyne and arterie haue come vnto the sayd bosome of the kidney, they are first either of them deuided into ij. braunches, before they make any entraunce at all, one braunch offring it selfe to the vpper corner of the same hollow, and the other to the neither. And in the same progresse of the vessels into the reines, the arteries very seldome scatter from them selues any braunches, but are wholly spent in the substaunce of the reynes.

            ¶ Of the History of Man, the vij. Booke: of the makyng of the hart, and of the Instrumentes ministryng to his function: commonly called, The Vitall or Spirituall partes.
            
            
               BEfore you all whosoeuer you are (most attentiue Readers) I fréely protest, that hetherto my penne hath not wauered in the doubtfull balaunce of ambiguitie, but passed the playne pathe of truth, guided by the footesteppes of my forerunners: till now at length, beyng come to a place somewhat ascendyng (as they that will attayne to the scope of their desire, must not refuse the hill with the dale) I finde the steppes of some willingly yeldyng to so tedious a iourney: others, with senses vnappalled, to haue plowed a path directly ouer the moūtaine: here I see one willingly walking a contrary way: and there an other, praysing their endeuours, but protestyng him selfe onely to haue light in the nearest way. So that here, no maruell, though I should stand amased, and as one plunged in the depth of contrary streames.
            For Galen, Vesalius & diuers others, as touchyng ye instrumentes that restoreThe opinion of Galen and Vesalius how bloud commeth into the left Uentricle of the hart. the ayrie substaunce, whiche continually waste, and refreshe the innated heate, are contented to affirme, that, of the ayre drawen in by the lunges, part is receiued by the surcles and braunches of the veniall Arterie, and there hence, beyng prepared by the elaboration of the lunges, is by the same vessell caryed into the left ventricle of the hart, where, metyng with the bloud lately strayned through the hedge betwene the ij. ventricles, it doth together by the workyng of the hart, ordaine that famous composition, the vitall spirite.

            Albeit I am not ignoraunt, how lately, both these assertions are denyed: Leonardus
               Leonardus Botallus. 
               Botallus prouyng that bloud is brought into the left Uentricle an other way, that is, by a propper Ueyne that is found somewhat aboue the coronall Ueyne, neare adioyning to the right auricle, thence with direct tract marchyng to the left: which contrarietie notwithstandyng (lest I should séeme to confound the History of the vital members:) I haue thought good to describe the partes after the best approued, and that in such wise, as there shall appeare therein great perspicuitie, and likehode of truth. Yet not that I meane to reiect Botallus, although he hath neither distinctly set downe the deriuation of that Ueyne, neither apertly the insertion therof, but because the labour of him shalbe lesse, that endeuoureth, alone, to stoppe the runnyng streame, accomptyng any duety none (right curteous Reader) in describing the partes, to haue forewarned thée of this late inuention.
            To the which description that I may briefly come, I will omit further circū

            The settyng to of the auricle is much after this sort. The left side of his seate,Situation. groweth to the extreme part of the substaunce of the hart, where the anteriour region of the Orifice of the hollow Ueyne consisteth in the right Uentricle of the hart: or more truly, the auricle goeth forth from that same extreme part. But the right side of his seate, groweth to the body of the hollow Ueyne, after the longitude of his insertion into the hart, and in the anteriour part therof, beyng made, as it were, one body with the veyne. The rest of the auricle is frée frō the knittyng to of any part, beyng conteined also within the inuolucre of the hart, though with no Fibrous knittyng committed thereto.
            The left auricle of the hart, is in very many poyntes like vnto the right. For

And so from his seate also, ceasseth at his poynt, as is sayd of the other. Which poynt beyng sharper then the poynt of the right auricle, but is reached more toward the left side. Besides, the left in more aged persons, giueth place to halfe the largenes of the right auricle, like as the Orifice of the veniall arterie, is much lesse then the Orifice of the hollow Ueyne.
            As touchyng the inside and outside, the auricles are euery where one like an other. Although the exteriour Supersice of the left, is alway more wrinkled and vnequall. In substaunce also they are agreable, but the left is much harder, and in constriction and distention is lesse obedient. And if it be compared to the right auricle, it appeareth féeble and dryed, and on the outside alway, aboundyng more with fat then the right.
            In knitting they agrée altogether. For as the right groweth to the right side of the hart & Vena caua, nigh the insertion therof: so in like sort the left in the right side of his seate groweth to the substaunce of the hart where the veniall arterie goeth forth: but on the left side to the same body of the veniall arterie.
            
               In vse notwithstandyng they differ, although very litle. For when as the

                     〈◊〉
                  , and, as it were in snatchyng wise, doth swallow it, the same Vena caua, not consistyng of any strong or arterious body, should greatly haue bene daungered, I meane for breakyng, in that strong attraction of the hart: saue onely that therfore nature created the right auricle of the hart, which beyng obedient to the mouyng of the hart, and full with bloud, should poure forth the same bloud which it conteineth, into the right ventricle whē the hart is dilated, and that the same should be, after a sort, rowled into that ventricle to dispence with the force of attraction, and to be to the hart, as a ready hand or storehouse. Aunswerable to which vse is the cuticular construction of the auricle which is light, and to the sufferyng of iniuries resistaunt. Hollow it is to conteine the matter, and construct with Fibres, as a thyng subiect to attraction, retention, and expulsion.
            Likewise the left auricle of the hart, growyng to the veniall arterie, beareth altogether the like seruice vnto it, and to the left ventricle of the hart, as we haue sayd the right eare to be in vse to the right Uentricle. And so much the lesse is the cauitie of the right eare, by how much the Orifice of the veniall arterie, is narrower then the orifice of Uena caua. In mouyng also, ayre is more ready to folow then bloud, so that for this occasiō also, the left auricle is made lesse thē the right.
            THe hart of mā obtaineth within, two notable and large cauities, called of the  Latins Ventriculi or Sinus, sited after the sides of the hart, one on the right, the other on the left. Wherof the right excéedeth the other in largenes, and both of them in fourme varie much one from an other.
            For the right descendyng more downwardes to the poynt of the hart then the  left, hath his cauitie made like the Moone encreasing. As in the right side, anteriour, and posteriour part, like the inside of a halfe circle, there aunsweryng to the exteriour Superfice which is Gibbous. But on the left side of it, it is Gibbous like the outside of a halfe circle, by meanes of the hedge betwene the Uentricles, which as a thyng halfe round, bouncheth into the amplitude of the right Uentricle. And this fourme the right Uentricle of the hart obserueth, from the seate down to the point. No otherwise then as the figure of the hart is made also from his seate narrower.
            The left Uentricle also begynneth with a large seate, but by litle and litle becommeth  streter towardes the poynt of the hart, obtaining as touching the whole Superfice, a round cauitie like a Pincapple. For the hedge that is betwene the Uentricles of the hart, on the left side, wherewith it maketh the right of the left Uentricle, is hollow contrary to the other side, which bouncheth into the right Uentricle, and hath equall thickenes and nature with the substaunce of the hart, constitutyng the anteriour and posteriour partes of the left Uentricle. But the whole substaunce of the hart, beside of the hedge of the Uentricles, constitutyng the amplitude of the right Uentricle, is very thinne. But that which effourmeth and compasseth about the left Uentricle, surmounteth much in thicknes the substaunce of the right Uentricle, and is euery where a like thicke, sauyng the seate onely, where for the insertion of the vessels, so much substaunce must needes wāt, as the amplitude of the Orifices do occupy space.
            The Superfice or inside of both the Uentricles is very vnequall, and beset as it were with many causes, déepely impressed into the fleshy substaunce. Neither do these consist onely in the sides where the right ventricle respecteth the left, but round about, throughout the whole Superfice of the ventricle: and that not onely in new dissected bodies, but perpetually apparaūt as oft as you lust to behold the hart: neither at any tyme not appearyng in a dryed hart besides this inequalitie, which in the left ventricle is something greater: both of them haue inwardly certaine

fleshy explantations or Processes, which are round and slender, and ceasse into Membranous Fibres, continuall or ioyned to the lower seate of the Membrans in their borders reposed. These Processes are chiefly discerned fleshy at the poynt, or lower part of the Uentricles, which make to the strength of the Fibres, which they conteyne.
            That through the hedge situated betwene these two Uentricles, bloud shouldCol. Loc. cit. passe, as it were by resudation, from the right into the left Uentricle, almost all Anathomistes hetherto haue affirmed. And that the same in passage also should be made thinner for the more easie generation of vitall spirites. But very wyde they wander, sayth Collumbus. For the bloud through the arteriall Ueyne is caried to the lunges, whence, beyng attenuated, it is caried by the veniall arterie into the left Uentricle of the hart together with ayre: which no man before his tyme noted, or at least haue left extant.
            MOreouer about the seate or foundation of the hart, foure vessels are apparaunt:

                  . two to the right Uentricle, and two to the left: in the right, the hollow Ueyne, and arteriall Ueyne: but in the left, the great arterie Aorta, and the veniall arterie.
            Notwithstandyng, estéeme not (as many suppose) that the hollow veyne doth  spryng from thence: for it goeth not into the hart, as falsely they imagine, but beyng deuided or cleft a sunder in that place, cleaueth onely to the Orifice of the right Uentricle.
            The arteriall veyne neither springeth from the hart, but from the liuer. For  note, if we behold the same whilest the infant as yet is shrouded within the mothers wombe, we shall finde the hollow veyne to be continuall with the arteriall Ueyne. In somuch therfore as it is a Ueyne, it fetcheth the begynnyng from the liuer, but as touchyng that it is arteriall, frō the hart. For of all artcries the hart is the fountaine. It goeth to the lunges to carie bloud for the nourishment of the instrument, and to the end, that the same may be altered for the hart. Sufficient great is this arteriall Ueyne, yea much greater then was néedfull, if the bloud had bene onely to be caried to the lunges, in so small spáce aboue the hart. It is deuided into two trunkes or notable braunches, both to the right, and to the left lunges: thence forth into sundry braunches, as before is sayd in the lunges.
            The arterie named Aorta, which of all other arteries is the mother, springeth from the left Uentricle of the hart, and riseth vpward.
            But before we prosecute the description of this arterie, it séemeth méete to  speake of the veniall arterie, set to the left ventricle of the hart it is called an arterie, in that it serueth to spirites and arteriall bloud: but a veyne, because it hath the body or substaūce of a veyne. It is a vessel sufficient large, which also through the lunges is deuided like the arteriall veyne.
            The opinion of other Anathomistes is, that the vse of these diuisions of this vessell into the lunges, is to cary vnto the lunges the altered ayre, which are as a fanwynde to the hart, to coole the same: they supposing also that then the lunges do receiue certaine I know not what fumes frō the left ventricle. And this inuē
               tion doth meruailously delight them: because they imagine that in the hart surely the like is accustomed to be done as in chimneyes: as though in the hart were gréene stickes, which whilest they burne, do make a smoke or fume. Thus much Collumbus writeth accordyng to the sentence of other Anathomistes. But he him selfe iudgeth cleane an other way: as thus, that this veniall arterie is made to cary from the lunges, bloud mixt with ayre, into the left Uentricle of the hart. Which thyng (sayth he) is as true, as that which is most true: not onely beyng apparant to euery inspection of dissected bodyes, but manifest also in quicke diffections of creatures, how full of bloud this Ueyne is alway founde: which could

not be so, if it had bene made onely for ayre and vapours.
            It is to be noted that in the Orifices of the iiij. vessels, at the seate of the hart, xi. Membrās do stand, called Trisulcae or iij. edged that is to say iii. to Vena caua, 
               
                  〈◊〉
               . to the arteriall veyne, iij. to the arterie Aorta, & ii. to the veniall arterie: which are not all in figure alike. For those which are put to the hollow veyne, & veniall arterie, are diuerse in fourme from the Membrans of the great arterie, and arteriall veyne. For the Membrans of these, are like iij. of those letters which the Latins call C: but the others are like arrowes. The vse of these is meruailous: and by their meanes, we learne and perceiue many thynges, that appertaine to the knowledge of the functions both of the hart and lunges. Know therfore, that as they are in figure diuers, so their vtilitie not all a like. The wickettes therfore (for so they may not much vnaptly be termed) of the hollow veyne and veniall arterie, are sited from within forth, as seruyng to the emission of bloud: but the wickettes of the other ii. vessels, contrariwise, from without forth, or inward, that so they might séeme vnto vs to be made, for the conteining of included bloud. This also note, that those litle wickets, which from within forth are opened, abound here and there with certaine filmentes or threedes, dispersed through the ventricles, made so to hold and strengthen them. By which filmentes peraduenture Aristotle was deluded, supposing them to be Nerues: so therfore he assigned the hart to be the roote of Nerues, and consequently of féelyng and mouyng. But to returne to the foure vessels: two of them are made to carie into the hart, whilest yt hart is dilated: but the other ii. to beare forth in the time of constriction.
            When the hart therfore is dilated, it receiueth bloud from the hollow 
                  •…
               eyne into the right ventricle, as also from the veniall arterie, prepared bloud and spirite into the left ventricle. Therfore those Membrans lye downe and yeld to goyng in. For whilest the hart is coarcted, these are shut: left any thyng they haue receiued, should returne or go backe agayne the same wayes: and at the same instaunt the Membrans, of the great arterie, and arteriall veyne are opened, and giue way to the goyng forth of the ayerie bloud, which throughout the whole body is dispersed, and to the naturall bloud caried forth to the lunges.
            The matter therfore is alway so, that when the hart is dilated, the Membrans first mentioned, are opened and the rest shut. So that you shall finde the bloud which is now gone into the right ventricle, not able any more to go backe agayne into the hollow veyne. By which sense we gather that the hart by no meanes is that member wherein bloud is engendred, as Aristotle sayth, when as the bloud is from Vena caua distributed,
            This moreouer know for a suretie, that in the hart of man is no bone to be found, although in Oxen, Horses, and such great creatures it may be shewed, but in man no such thyng, except it chaunce, that in very aged persons the like be inuented: as in the History of bones I haue protested my selfe once to haue found. Onely a Cartilaginous substaunce at the roote of the great arterie, towardes the arteriall veyne is sene, whiche a Bone in no wise may be called, although Galen him selfe would haue it so: whose sentence partly I haue set forth in the place afore cited.
            Suppose this assertiō most approued in Anathomie, that all arteries procéede from the hart, euen as all 
                  •…
               eynes from the liuer, & all Nerues from the brayne.
            From the left Uentricle of the hart therefore, springeth that arterie named  
               Aorta, of all other arteries in the body the mother. In quantitie it is sufficient large, and in substaunce thicke and white. The cause of the thicknes is first, least the bloud with filled spirite should easely vanishe and wast, and secondly least it in mouyng should be broken. For the Arterie moueth continually, yet not by it selfe but through spirites.
            
               AFter that Aorta is gone forth from the hart, immediately it bringeth forth  a small arterie called the coronall, because it compasseth about the seate of the hart, to quicken and refresh his substaunce, in which it is diuersly disseminated: albeit you haue to note by the way that in some bodyes this coronall arterie is not onely one, but ij. and so Vesalius describeth it: but further ascendyng, it is deuided into ij. trunkes or stockes, one greater, the other lesser: the greater descē
               deth, the lesser ascendeth, that trunke is made the greater which I say doth descend, for that the great portion of the body was to be reuiued therewith.
            The trunke ascending putteth forth an arterie from the left side, which is called  the Axillaris arteria, which stretcheth forth obliquely towardes the armehole, and sendeth braunches to the superiour ribbes, and goyng forth to the arme choseth his iourney after the inside, to mate himselfe with the inner Basilica, but sendyng a braunche vpwardes, commaundeth others to all those Muscles, which are about the shoulder, the scapple bone, and his cauitie, not faylyng the anteriour partes of the brest, nor the Glandules vnder the armehole.
            But the trunke of Arteria axillaris descendeth straight through the inner region of the shoulder, downe to the boughte of the cubite: and before it passe this part, it giueth out a litle Arterie to accompany the fourth Nerue of the arme, whiche Arterie is among the Muscles distributed, that serue to extend the cubite: but so soone as it hath passed the bought of the cubite, it is deuided into two, sometyme into thrée arteries, yet first it leuyeth litle arteries to those Musc

                  es that are in the shoulder and cubite, and one braunche goeth neare to that Ligament that is set betwene Cubitus and Radius, and being gone forth marcheth to the externe Muscles. The remnant foloweth the longitude of the cubite: which after it hath flowed beyond vnder the inner transuerse Ligament of the wrest, in the palme of the hand, it is diuers wayes deuided, and to the extremities of the fingers deuided: but an other braunch tendeth towardes Radius after his conductyng: and so soone as it is past the mid
                  •…
               est of the cubite, it ariseth betwene two Muscles: and goeth vnder the skinne by the inner part of Radius. This is that braunch, whose mouyng Phisitions are accustomed to féele, when they lay hold of the wrest, to take counsell at the pulse.
            By the way notwithstandyng I wish thée this to note, that in some persons this braunch is diuersly placed, so that to be the same, whiche hetherto we haue spoken of, thou mayest take occasion to doubt, in that it is sometyme caried on yt outside. So that what Phisition soeuer, vnexpert in Anathomie, shall in the accustomed place (chiefly in a sicke body) onely séeke for the pulse, and can not finde it, he will iudge vntruly death to be neare that person, and so prognosticate falsely.
            Albeit no man may deny, but that very seldome it is otherwise situated, for in déede for the most part, it doth occupy the inside. This moreouer so soone as it departeth from the wrest, it procéedeth through the outside, to the extremities of the fingers. An other braunch neare to the Ligament is caried.
            This trunke afterwardes ascendyng, this Axillaris arteria beyng now dispersed, it is cut into ij. arteries called Car

                partes of the necke, are straight caried to the seate of the scull, cleauyng to Aspera arteria, & fixed to the inner veynes called Iugulares. But before they enter into the Scull, they send ij. arteries to the face, & beyng deuided vnder the neither iawe, they impart of the smaller sort, to the Muscles of the necke, of the head, of Larinx, of Hyoides, and of the toung. But the two braunches (which are the greater) caried to the toung, are caried throughout his lōgitude to the extremitie therof, which iourney beyng atchieued, they ascend vnder the eare, and both before & beside the same, are to the temporall Muscles eleuated, so then beyng to the forehead, to the skinne of the head, and to the Muscles of the face distributed.
            
               The other arme or bowe therof, which to be caried backwardes we haue affirmed, is bestowed vpon those i

From the same place, and somewhat higher also two arteries fetch their begynnyng, entryng into the nether iawe, vnder the eare, in at the hole there (if you behold diligently) sited, after the longitude of the iawe: with whiche Arteries a Ueyne and Nerue are ioyned in societie: but then they are dispersed to all the rootes of the nether téeth: a part notwithstāding goeth forth through the hole in the chinne, and marcheth through the lippe. This Arterie

               Uesalius forgot, in somuch that he hath made no mention at all therof.
            BUt before we fall to the description of those arteries which are conteined in the Scull, certaine others are first to be described, of which a part also is taken from the Scull.
            It is to be noted therfore, that y• right Arteria axillaris doth spryng frō a placeThe beginning of the left is higher then the ri
                     •…
                  ht. lesse exalted then the left. Moreouer it marcheth not in oblique order as it doth. But the begynnyng of it is frō the right arterie Soporaria, in the regton of the Canell bone it goeth straight through the armehole vnder the Canell Bone: to the right arme: where it is deuided & marcheth foreward like as doth the left. But from the anteriour part, whence these Soporaria, & Axillaris arteria do spryng, ij. arteries do grow tendyng downwardes, & seno their braunches to the superiour spaces of the ribbes, & to the Vertebres, of which two arteries, Vesalius was ignoraunt:Col. Ibid. also other ij. small arteries do arise, which vnder Sternon are conuerted, & descend, associatyng those two veynes, which tended to the pappes, & to the borders of the straight Muscles. After their maner therfore are deuided.
            Almost in the same region, but backwardes, towardes the bodies of the Vertebres, you shall note ij. other arteries, which being caried through y• trāsuerse Processes of the Vertebres of the neckes (for to that end nature left them perforated) as also through those holes, out of which the sinewes do procéede, do commaunde their brannches to the Spinall marey and Vertebres, & to those Muscles, that side wayes do serue to bowe the necke: albeit that in some persons these ij. arteries are not from Soporariae, as in the most, but often from the arteries Axillares, produced. These arteries, which thus we substitute to animall contemplation, betwene the head and first Vertebre, do make ingresse into the posteriour part of the Scull: that is to wit, betwene the same Vertebre and the Spinall marey: first ministryng vnto the caue or laberinthe of the eare ij. arteries, which in their ingresse do mingle together. But in such order the right is vnited to the left, as that of both, one for the length of halfe a finger, is made: Into ij. it is afterward deuided: then agayne into many others, and first they reach to Dura and Tenuis meuinx, and then to Cerebellum. By these the begynnyng of the Spinall marey, Cerebellum, and part likewise of the brayne, are reuined and quickned: and if nature had not begotten, these (sayth Collumbus) the posteriour partes of the Scull had wanted arteries.
            These ij. arteries, whiche through the transuerse Processes of the Vertebres do arise vpward, betwene the first Vertebre, & the bone of the hinder part of the head, enter into the inner region of the Scull betwene the same Vertebre, & the spinall marey. But after they are entred into the cauitie of the Scull by the lēgth of halfe a finger, they are ioyned together, and of ij. made one onely arterie.
            Neuerthelesse they are agayne forthwith deuided, and that into a right and a left, from which, arteries are to the ij. Membrans of the brayne, and to Cerebellum suborned. And further, through the substaunce of these partes, in the vpper part, through the halfe space of the Scull, most large is the distribution of these arteries. The rest of the Scull is reuined by the ramification of the ij. arteries Carwtides,
               
or Soporaria, as shortly shalbe sayd. Which before they penetrate into the Scull, imparte of their power by litle Arteries into the laberinthe of the care. But so soone as this trunke of the Arterie is entred into the Scull, as is before sayd, it dispatcheth forth braunches to the Spinall marey, to the hard and thinne Membran, to the brayne, and Cerebellum.
            
            Of these ij. arteries the true distribution, no man hath knowne before Collumbus,

Wherefore (sayth he) no meruaile, if so much he deuided the description of auncient Anathomistes, as touchyng Rete mirabile: since rather from these Arteries, of whiche he was ignoraunt, then from the Arterie Carwtides, the meruailous net is effourmed: although neitherP

            But these two Arteries whiche we haue described, are vnder the Spinall marey exalted vpwardes, and besides those manifold braunches, whiche are sprinkled throughout the thinne Membran, they passe into the substaunce of the brayne, in that place, whiche is called Cwnarium, or Glandula Pinealis, in theThis glandule in the brayne beareth the shape of p

                and worthy admiration, are immitted two Arteries named Caratides, as in their place shall not be omitted. Therfore of foure Arteries this marueilous nette is made, most notable to eche studious Anathomist, both for the dignitie and newnes of the thyng, which before Collumbus was neuer taught or noted.
            The Arteries Carwtides, so soone as they are come to the seate of the Scull, they seeme to enter the hole, forth of whiche did passe the vj. payre of sinewes, and whiche doth take in charge the inner Ueynes Iugulares: albeit they arise not vp, nor here do bryng forth two Arteries, as Uesalius affirmeth: who alsoCol.

                  , would haue them to enter into the cauities of the hard Membran together with the Ueynes Iugulares. But then thou wilt say peraduenture, what do these Arteries vnder the seate of the Scull? They are conuerted to the Anteriour part, and passe through a hole, which lurketh in the tēporall bone neare that, through whiche the sixt coniugation of sinewes descendeth, and they enter among the inner Iugulares: but before they be receiued of the inner part of the Scull, they deliuer forth two Arteries, whose braunches are diuers, to wit, to the palate, to the inside of the nose, to the vpper téeth: others' enter into the Scull by those holes there sited, and lyke a trée through the sides of the hard Membran, together with those Ueynes therein conspicuous, are explicated, and therefore is Sincip

            But after that these Arteries haue esfused forth these braūches to the palate, & téeth as is sayd, they rise vp into the Scull through that hole, which is sited betwene Sphenoïdos & the temporal bone, in which place a part of the thyrd payre of sinewes descendeth: although Vesalius for the same doth reprehend Galen. But so sooue as they are passed the seate or sell of Sphenoïdes, they minister ij. Arteries to the eyes a long by the opticke sinewes, to shew lyfe vnto the eyes, and not onely lyfe vnto the eyes, but also to the Muscles of the eyes, and to those by which the iawe is opened, I meane the vpper iawe: wherefore you shall finde the

diuisions of these large and many.
            That whiche remaineth of these Arteries Caralides, ascendeth aboue the aforesayd sell coherent with the thinne Membran, and after the callous body toward the posteriour partes, and diuers wayes is sprinkled through the thinne Membran, aboue, within, and to the sides. Also some of their braunches are deduced from the thinne to the hard Membrā, and others from the thinne Membran to the substaunce of the brayne.

               Collumbus notwithstandyng boldly affirmeth this (if it be any where at all) to be the marueilous nette: for no where (sayth he) shall you finde such foldes, through foldes, and interweauynges of the least, and innumerable Arteries, els. But Galen did describe the marueilous nette whereof he maketh mention, to be aboue Sphenoïdes, where that Glandule, whiche receiueth euery excrement begotten in the braynes, beyng to that office by Nature dedicated, is resident. But whosoeuer shall seeke the same where Galen hath described it, he shalbe frustrate of his purpose. For nothyng els shall he finde there, but certaine litle Arteries, ministryng lyfe to these partes, and to the bone Sphenoïdes. The same Arteries, which thus constitute the marueilous nette, do send their power through the substaunce of the brayne: whiche thyng of no other Anathomist, saue onely of Collumbus, hath bene written.
            And this is the end of the description of the superiour trunke of the great Arterie, without you make accompt of those Arteries to be described, which flow forth to the right superiour ribbes. This by the way is worthy to be noted, that not one Arterie tendeth to the lunges, whereby they might receiue vitall spirites from the hart. And this is a sentence most approued in Anathomie, that (exceptyng the lunges onely) all other partes of mans body are endewed with beatyng Arteries. By whiche reason, Collumbus protesteth sufficient authoritie to what seuere disputer soeuer, shall goe about to proue, that in the hart it selfe are not begotten the vitall spirites. But of this matter is other where sayd.
            The greater trunke of the great Arterie called (as we haue often sayd) Aorta, tendyng downewardes, declineth towardes the left side, and is to the body of the Vertebres adherent, whiche to the superiour trunke is not incident. For that, no otherwise then Vena caua, is distaunt from the Vertebres. This inferiour trunke therefore, whilest it descendeth, out of his hynder part profereth Arteries to the spaces of the ribbes: and these agayne charge others to the Spinall marey, to the Vertebres, and to the Muscles, in the posteriour part of the brest sited. But where it commeth downe to Septum transuersum, bringyng forth two a lyke Arteries, whiche are into the same distributed, it passeth vnder the same, and still cleauyng to the body of the Vertebres, marcheth downe to the last Vertebre saue one of the loynes. But so soone as it hath passed the midreif, it produceth an Arterie to the liuer, in place whence

                  ena parta went forth, as we haue sayd: beyng there distributed. An other spredeth to the vessicle of choler, an other to the splene, an other to the

Uentricle and Omentum: other litle braunches to the Glandulous body Pancreas, and others also to the intestine Colon. Under this an other appeareth, whereof are very many and large diuisions, both through Mesenterium, and to the small guttes: beyng perpetuall mates to many of the Meseraicall veynes.
            Moreouer a litle lower it begetteth two Arteries, and those very notable, called the Emulgent Arteries, which enter into the kidneys. Under the Emulgent Ueynes, a litle more bendyng downe, it produceth the two seminall Arteries, whiche haue their begynnynges from the body of the great Arterie, but not from the left Emulgent (except in very fewe) as to Galen it séemed. These descendyng, are folded together with the seminall Ueynes downe to the Testicles, both in man, and young mayde, and in women to the body of the matrice, yea to the inner part of the matrice: and from these the vmbellicall Arteries of the infant, take their begynnyng.
            Under these seminall Arteries, in the middest of the trunke emergeth an other Arterie, whiche is caryed to the Mesenterium of the straight gutte, and to part of the intestine Colon, after the left side of Ileon. But the Arteries of the strayght gutte, downe to the extreme part of the fundament, together with the Meseraicall Ueynes of Vena porta, do descend, wherfore there are made both Ueynes & Arteries called Haemorroidales: in the posteriour part out of the same Arterie vnder the midreif, Arteries make egresse to the Vertebres, to the Spinall marey, to the Muscles of the backe, and to the Muscles of the bellye.
            But so soone as it is come to the last Vertebre of the loynes but one, and in some bodyes to the last of all, it is first deuided into two and those great braunches, whiche 
                  〈◊〉
                the right and the left side, but surmountyng the hollow Ueyne in the region of Os sacrum. These two braunches are subdeuided, and descendyng more, are ramified to the sides of the bleddar, to the necke of the matrice, and to the Muscles resident in the concauitie of Abdomen. Two others likewise passe through the holes sited in Os pubis and Coxendix: from whiche holes, so soone as these Arteries are gone forth of Abdomen, they are sent to the two bodyes of Penis, from the toppe to the lowest part, and them do they passe in braunches: they beyng those Arteries, by whiche erection of the yard is made: whiche thyng neither hath any man noted vnto vs but Collumbus. The remnaunt of these Arteries, is dispersed through those Muscles, whiche are put in the inside of the thighe, but they passe not the knée.
            From those Arteries whiche the bleddar receiueth, others also are purchased, whiche beyng brought to the inner part of Os sacrum, through whose holes they tend, both to the same, and to the Spinall marey: but without, to the Muscles seruyng the thighe. Lyke as also from the great diuision of the Arterie, some issue forth, whiche with vitall bloud, do nourishe the Muscles of the thighe, whiche are within the belly situated. But of those Arteries whiche after Os sacrum and Coccix do descend, some together with certaine Ueynes of Vena caua, do flowe to the Muscles called Sphincter: the whiche Arteries, may also be called Hemorroides.
            
            Moreouer out of the great diuision of the great Arterie, two other Arteries spryng, whiche are reflected vpwardes, and passing through Peritonaeum, do ascend vnder the straight Muscles aboue the nauell: and in many braunches are ended among the Muscles of Abdomen.
            
            In this diuision two Arteries, called Vmbelicales, are set downe, whiche are the first Arteries that in the infant are begotten. For after that they make apparaunce from the Nauell: they marche through Peritonaeum, in what place it is double, vnto the sides of the bleddar, and doe begette these Arteries, of whiche somewhat before is sayd. But after the begynnyng of the Vmbelicall
               
Arteries, the hart it selfe is begotten: but to returne agayne to the Vmbelicall Arteries, for of any such partes I determine not further to speake. These, after our bodyes are brought to light, are dryed vp, and vsurpe the office of two Ligamentes.
            
            But furthermore the two armes of the great trunke, whiche are caried downe into the legges, passe vnder the fift Muscle of the loynes bowyng the thigh, and goyng forth towardes Abdomen aboue Os Ilium, and Pubis, are ioyned in fellowshyp with the inner veynes of this place, whiche marche among the Muscles. And like as those veynes are deuided: so in lyke sorte we sée these Arteries to all the Muscles of the legge, foote, toes, and their extremities, disparcled. Finally, they commend their force by braunches, to the Glandules of the flanke, to the purse of the Testicles, and vnder the skinne to the yard.
            Now diligent Reader note, that not the Bones them selues are destitute of Arteries, least so they should lacke vitall warmth also: without which, no part in the body lyueth.

But this is not all, for vnder the Scull are contained two couerynges or nearer enclosures, one distaunt from an other, made also for the safetie of the brayne. Those Bones of the head (as in the History of Bones is largely declared) are so worthely closed and seamed together, that they can not be separated, nor the brayne hurt without excéedyng violence. Whereof contrarywiseThe hart is more easely hurt then the brayne. to the hart appertaineth no such defēce: forbetwene the spaces of the ribbes, an instrumēt moued with small force may intercept the office and function therof. Wherfore it playnly appeareth that nature was more carefull in constituting the brayne, then in placyng the hart.

               son of truth, thinketh that Nature rather ordayned such foldes in the brayne as a meanes of nourishement to the substaunce thereof: for neither is it so firme in any place, that Ueynes and Arteries, as in other

partes of the body, may be through the same in euery place scatteryngly dispersed: nor yet so small and slender in quantitie, that Ueynes, and Acteries in the toppe onely braunchyng, are sufficient to nourish and warme the same throughout. Which prouident Nature foreseeyng, hath engrauen these cornered implexures, that in them the thinne Membran, replenished with sundry vessels, might insinuate it selfe, whereby to minister nourishment more fitly to the substaunce of the brayne.
            And chiefly also for the occasion of this nourishment, was the brayne in two partes dissected, that is to say, that the thinne Membran might fold it selfe in the middle therof, and there made in reflexures, should nourish the substaunce of the brayne: without which diuision of the brayne, and déepe reuolutions, that part of the brayne, whereas the right side beholdeth the left, should not be nourished.

            ANd to come to the middest of his substaunce, we finde two cauities, or ratherTwo Ventricles of the brayne. (for so are they called) ventricles, as one would say, a right, and a left, whiche are long, anfractuous or crooked, stretchyng from the anteriour to the  posteriour part.

But if they had wanted induyng, then no more had man aunswered the fourme of a liuyng creature, but a picture rather of stone, or clay: and on the other side, from the brayne to reach both small & great nerues to euery part, had bene the part of a workeman, litle wayeng the securitie of the nerues.
            Therfore the Spinall marey was prouided, that there hence Nerues mightThe vse of the spinall marey. spring to fulfill all other partes of the body with sence, and mouyng: which are otherwise destitute, for any of the vj. payre of the brayne, that visiteth them. Then that this marey should be of affinitie with the brayne, which prouideth so noble partes to the body, who can doubt, gayne say, or inueigh to the contrary, vnlesse he beare armour agaynst truth.
            IT is described by Anathomistés diuersly, as touchyng the partes of sinewes traduced from the Spinall marey: but because we will consume no tyme to aunswere, and reply vpon euery selfe opinion, for séemyng ouer correctiue, as some are ready to obiect, we wil fall to the onely distribution of Nerues. That is when they proceede, and how they are after sowne abroad among the partes of the body.Collumb. Ibid.
            
            The first payre therfore of these Nerues is sent forth betwene the bone of the  hinder part of the head, and the first Vertebre of the necke, so priuely, and artificially,The first payre of nerues from the spinall

And to the end this might safely be brought to passe, nature hath engrauen a proper cauitie, as well in the bone of the hinder part of the head, as also in that side of the first Vertebre, or turnyng ioynt of the necke, which ought to end at a spine,

or poynt. This coniugation of nerues thus departing, are afterwardes disparcted into diuers and sundry litle braunches, both by reason that the payre it selfe is but small, as also more commodiously to be distributed vnto the notable company of smal Muscles that serue to the head. For they arose the first Vertebre, and were caried to the hinder part of the head, and agayne, from thence reduced to the second Vertebre. But before it go forth, is reflected aboue the Spinall marey: a thyng notable to behold.
            The second payre, or coniugation of sinewes, because of the impossibilitie of  commyng forth at the sides of the Vertebres, as appeareth, hath two

The other begynnyng lesse then this, commeth forth by the forepartes, betwene the first and second Vertebre, by the sides of the tooth therof, (as appeareth by the description of the second Vertebre, in the history of Bones) and is distributed to the fift Muscle of Larinx, which is common to Aesophagus.
            
            The third payre of sinewes engendred of the Spinall marey, créepeth through  the common hole of the second and third Vertebre; & from their sides as you haue heard by the rest. Then after hath a former diuision, which is into foure partes or braūches, but those not so contented are into very many partes, some to the Muscles of the bead, & to that

This payre thus passing forth (as I say,) is into diuers braunches deuided, whereof some ascende, some descende, and others

But among the fore partes or braunches, some are inserted to the Muscle, strewed vnder the stomache, one of the which, being a small one, is vnited with a braunch of the fift payre, and the fift with the sixt: of the which thrée beginnyngs are constitute those Nerues, which march forwardes downe to the Septum transuersum, descendyng by Mediastina, and aboue Pericardium.

The anteriour braunches, which is most of the others apparant, is vnited with a braūch of the fourth payre, and in some, taketh a litle braunch from the others that follow. This nerue, thus made and cōstructed of thrée, descēdeth to the sides of Aesophagus by the fore partes of the turnyng ioyntes of the necke, and so downe to the sinewy partes of Septum transuersum: In which part the end thereof is determined.

And for because in some that are wounded, some tyme féelyng is lost, and yet the maner of mouyng remaineth still, and in others contrarily, as the mouyng lost, sense seaseth not, in others so both are destroyed together: Some Anathomistes (I say) in this case séemyng astonyed, and deuising to finde the cause, haue made differences in Nerues, that is to say, they will haue it that in euery place where Nerues are distributed in the body, there should be both Nerues sensitiue, and moitie.

And therfore that it is sufficient to say, that those surcles of sinewes that disperse abroad in the skinne, do bryng sense, (since the skinne moueth not) and such as are addicted to the Muscles, impart to them both féelyng and mouyng. Wherefore when the Nerues of the skinne are wounded, or that noyfull matter segregated to those partes doth corrode or distroy them, it is no rare matter if the skinne in such places be left destitute of féelyng: as also mouyng is marred, when in place of the Muscles where they are resident, solution of continuitie is made, with breache of the concourse of the Nerues: And both are then maymed, when not onely in the Muscles, but also in y• skinne, the sinewes be dispersed or deuided. Iudge therfore in this wise the causes, when either sense or mouyng perisheth, as also when both be destroyed together. Or if I shall speake playnly, a hurt thatWhē by the hurtyng of a Nerue feelyng or monyng may be lost, when neither. chaunceth vnto the Nerue before it enter into the Muscle, and in place where it should Retrahere, and Contrahere, cannot be any meanes conioyne, or knitte together agayne. But if the like happen in that part whiche is already

entred the Muscle, in that parte shall neither continue amission of sense, nor mouyng.
            If the fancie of any reasonable man, that laboureth with no lesse industrie to séeke the truth, shall persuade him to adde a sixth payre of Nerues to the handes, as heretofore it séemed good to Vesalius, let him beware, least in his iudgementV

            Those that delite the fore partes, marche after the inferiour partes of the ribbes, after the cauitie in the lower part long wise engrauen: whiche in the History of Bones and description of the ribbes is more playnly set out, beyng cōuersaunt eche one in course, with a braunche of the veyne that is sayd to haue no mate, and of the great arterie. All which thrée (I meane the nerue, veyne, and Arterie,) passing by one way, euen from the aforesayd Vertebres to Os Sternon after the length of the ribbes, and the Cartilages, vnder the succingent Membran, or Pleura, like lynes equally and proportionably distaunced, do enter among the Muscles intercostales, amongest whiche, both the outward and inward, they are ramified and spread.
            Others are thought to bryng sense to the sixth Muscle of the brest, beyng placed in the inside of it, and do bynde together the forepartes thereof. From the foresayd, Nerues flow through the first Muscle of the shoulder, and through the second of the shoulder blade. Furthermore other braunches are caryed to the pappes, and their nipples or teates, brought from these nerues whiche in order follow: then more downward, from the nerues that are placed in the middle region of the brest, surcles are deriued, which are charged with the oblique descendent Muscles of Abdomen, in which place, of these nerues a large distribution is made.

And what portion therof remaineth, is committed to the Muscles, and skinne clothyng the backe.
            The fourth of these coniugations appeareth betwene the thyrd and fourth

Afterwardes in this region of the flanke it is deuided into seuen braunches, whiche are distributed to all the Anteriour Muscles which shew their seruice partly to the legge, and partly to the thigh: Of which braunches, some likewise descend vnto the knée.

Wherefore it auayleth not to meruaile why the grounded opinions of such famous men as haue sustayned great labour and traueil in the pilgrimage of mans body, should in tract of tyme sounde so dissonant, since neither countrey, age, nor nature haue consented, that in the bodyes of creatures should be no dissention.

            But note by the way, that the greater body of this sinew after it hath passed the bought of the knée, is presently into other partes diuersly deuided: wherof one stretcheth forth vnder the two first Muscles of the foote, whose sleshy partes, when it hath passed, and ouergone, it creepeth along vnder the skinne, hastyng spéedely after that sort to the h

From the other braunches, small surcles ariue at the fourth, and greater Muscle of the legge, from thence to the interiour and posteriour partes of the legge, and kéepeth his course vnder the inner ancle, so stretchyng vnder the sole of the foote, to augment his circuite, strayeth out to the very skinne, and to the first, second, and thyrd extreme Muscle of the foote, then afterwardes to all other sortes of small Muscles, that in the sole of the foote retaine any seruiceable offices. Moreouer, besides the sundry deuisions and distributiōs of this braunche rehearsed, it is after cut into ten portions of nerues, whiche by couples, that is to say, two to euery one, are commaūded to attend vpon the toes of the féete and their extremities, as also to yeld like bountie of their functions, to the skinne and cutancous partes of the toes.
            But an other braunche more deepely penetrateth betwene the greater and lesser Focile, cleauyng to the Ligament there intersited, which Ligament is sayd to deuide the anteriour from the posteriour Muscles, and ramifieth not obscurely amongest the fift, sixt, and seuenth Muscles of the foote. An other lesser trunke is intertained among the fore partes of the legge, slidyng vnder the Appendaunce of the lesser Focile, or Fibula, where it profereth nerues to the Muscles, aswell from the greater, as the lesser Focile exorted or sprong. The trunke descendethA Caueat for the applicatiō of cauterie to the legge. still downewardes, notwithstandyng by the anteriour partes of Fibula. Wherfore in this point we are admonished that in the application of a cauterie we presume not so farre as Fibula, but onely to the shinne or greater Focile, neither passe the depth of the first Muscle, for further, shall perish the nerue last recited, after which ensueth most greuous accidentes, and payne in that place perpetually.
            That portion of this nerue that remaineth, is caried vnder the Ligament, and fore part of the foote, pearsing vnder the extreme ancle, and through the extreme partes of the foote: out of which seate certaine surcles are sent to the xviij. Muscle of the foote. Then after what remaineth, is separated into x. litle nerues, all which are notably inserted, and surely setled to the extremities of the toes. Yet this is not all: for from the same trunke, one other small sinew is extended, least the extreme skinne partes of the foote, voyde of their company, should be frustrated of sensible propertie. After the iij. holes in Os sacrum, follow the fourth, and in some the fift.
            But here before I intermeddle any further, you shall consider a reasonable cause, why the number of these nerues of Os sacrum be not certaine, since as it séemeth eche authour writeth as he founde: which made some describe vj. others fiue, others foure &c. the cause I say is to be alledged in this point, like as in sundry other partes, the varietie of nature, and vnlike construction of the

Which after they are egressed or gone forth, beget also, by together knittyng, one notable nerue, which is naturally reflected and distributed amongest the Muscles of the haunches, and their skinne: also inwardly to the partes of Abdomen, as to the Muscles of the straight gutte, and of the bleddar.

But sayth he, amongest all which hetherto I haue dissected (almost innumerable) I haue sene the extreme part of the Spinall marey in very many surcles, both to the right, and left side, distributed as also further dispersed through the fourth Muscle of the thighe, and throughout the skinne which is betwene the haunches, and euen downe to the fundament.

For as no part is destitute of naturall warmthe, tell me what member wāteth the vitall and animall spirite: which as the first by the liuer and veynes, the secōd by the hart & arteries, so the thyrd by the brayne & sinewes is transposed through all the partes. And if nerues be the instruments,Galen de

               BEsides that in the History of the nutritiue partes are described the skinnes and fattes, and amōgest the Cartilages the nayles, there remaine yet certaine partes to be spoken of, which, in a solid discourse of the body of mā, may in no wise be omitted, as the marey cōteined within the bones, Periostion, & the heares.
            The greatest Bones therfore haue within them large capacities,
