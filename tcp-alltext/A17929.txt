                  Firſt I wil write the tokenes of this īfirmyte

               Firſt I ſayde the tokenes of this infirmite .vij. thinges ought to be noted in the ſame The firſt is when in a ſommers daye the weder often times chaungeth. as ī the mornyng the

wedyr appereth to payne / afterward it apꝑith cloudy & atte laſt wyndy ī the ſouth The .ij token is whan ī ſōmer the dayes apꝑith all̄ derke & like to mynr & yet it myneth not. & if many dayes ſo ꝯtinue it is to drede of grete peſtilence The .iij. tokyn is whan grete multitude of flies ben apon the eerthe thenne it is ſigne the ayer is venemous and infect The fourth token is whan the ſterres ſemen ofte times to falle then it is token that the ayer ys infect with moche venemous vapours. The .v. token is whan a blaſing ſterre is ſee ī the element then it is ſigne to be ſone after grete peſtilence or grete māſlaghter ī bataille The .vi. token is whan ther is grete lightnynge & thūdre namely out of the ſouth The .vij. token is whan grete wyndes paſſen out of the ſouth they be foule & vnclene. therfore whan theſe tokenes apꝑe it is to drede grete peſtilence but god of his mercy wille remeue it
            
            
               Here after folowen the cauſes of peſtilence
               The peſtilence cometh of .iij. thinges ſomtime it cometh fro the rote bynethe Otherwhile fro the rote aboue ſo that we may fele ſenſibly

how the chaunge of the ayer appereth vnto vs And ſomtyme it cometh of bothe to gider aſ well fro the rote aboue as fro the rote bynethe As we ſee a ſege or preuy next to a chambre or of any other particuler thyng whyche corrupteth the ayer in his ſubſtaunce and qualite whiche is a thyng may happe euery daye: And thereof cometh the ague of peſtylence. And aboute the ſame many phyſicions be deceyued: not ſuppoſing this axes to be a Peſtilence / ſomtime it cometh of dede careyn / or corrupcion of ſtandyng waters in diches or ſlouhes & other corrupt places & theſe thīges ſomtime be vniuerſall̄ & ſomtime ꝑticuler Fro the rote aboue: it fortuneth the cauſes of the bodyes aboue ī thayer by whom the ſpirite of lyfe is corrupte in a man or in a beſte: In like wyſe as Auycenne ſayth ī his fourth boke / by the forme of thayer aboue / the bodyes benethe lightly be infecte: For thynpreſſyons aboue corrupteth the ayer and ſo the ſpirites of a man ben corrupt. This infirmyte cometh alſo from the rote aboue and bynethe: whanne of thynpreſſyons aboue / the ayer

is corrupt & of the putrifaccion or rotyn caceyn of the vyle places benethe an infirmite is cauſed in a man. & ſuche an infirmyte ſomtime is an axes. ſomtime a poſtume or a ſwellyng & that is in many thynges. Alſo the ayer īſpyred is venemous & corrupt hurtīg the herte that nature many wayes is greued ſo that he ꝑceyueth not his harme: For the vryne appereth fayer & ſchewe

                  ued. The firſt ys wherfore one dyeth & another dyeth not in a towne where mē be dede ī one hous & ī another hous ther dyeth none. The .ij. q̄ſtion is whether peſtilence ſores be contagious. To the firſt q̄ſtion I ſaye it may happe to be of .ii. cauſes that is to ſay of that thīg that doth & of that thīg that ſuffreth. An enſample of that thīg that doth / the influence of the bodies aboue be

holdeth that place or that place more than this place or this place. & the pacient is more diſpoſed to die than another Therfore it is to be noted that bodies be more hote diſpoſed of oopyn poorys than bodies īfect hauīg the pores ſtopped with many humours wher bodies be of reſolucion or opening as men that abuſen them ſelf with wymmē or vſen ofte times bathes. or men that be hote with labour or grete angre their bodies be more diſpoſed to this ſekenes. To the .ij. q̄ſtion I ſay that peſtilence ſores be ꝯtagious becauſe of enfect humours bodies & the reke or ſmoke of ſuche ſores is venemous & corrupteth the ayer & therfore it is to flee fro ſuche ꝑſons as be īfect In peſtilēce time no body ſholde ſtande ī grete prece of peple for ſom mā of thē may be infect Therfore wiſe phiſiciēs viſiting ſeke folke ſtāde ferre fro the paciēt holdīg their face toward the dore or wyndowe & ſo ſhal the ſeruants of ſeke folke ſtāde Alſo it is gode to a pacient euy day to change his chābre & often times to haue the wyndowes open ayēſt the north & eeſt & to ſpere the wyndowes ayēſt the ſouth For the ſouth wīde hath two cauſes of

putrifaccion The firſt is it maketh a mā be ī hole or ſeke feble in their bodies: The .ij. cā is as it is writon ī the .iij. of Amphoriſmie the ſouth winde greueth the heering & hurteth the herte becauſe it openeth the pooris of mā & entreth īto the herte wherfore it is gode ī time of peſtilēce to an hole mā whan the wīde is in the ſouth to be withī the hous al day & if it nedeth to go out yet lete a mā abide ī his hous til the ſonne be vp in the eeſt paſſing ſouthward.

                  feſſe his ſinnes for whi it is the hieſt remedie ī time of peſtilence penance & ꝯfeſſion to be pferred al other medicines Neutheles I ꝓmitte you verely it is a gode remedy to voyde & chaunge thinfect place: but ſom may not proffitably change their places therfore aſmoche as to thē is poſſible it is teſchewe euy cauſe of putrifaction & ſtinking & namely euery fleſchely luſt with wymmē ſhalbe eſchewed Alſo the ſothern

winde whiche is naturelly infectif therfor ſpere the windowes ayenſt the ſouth as it is ſayde before til the firſt houre after the middes of the day then opene the wyndowes ayēſt the north Of the ſame cauſe euy foule ſtinche is to be eſchewed of ſtabyl ſtinkyng feldes wayes or ſtretes & namely of ſtinking dede careyn & moſte of ſtynking wats where in many placee wat is kepte .ij. dayes or .ij. nightes. or ellys ther be gutters of water caſten vnder therthe whiche cauſeth grete ſtinke & corrupcion & of this cauſe ſom deye in that hous where ſuche thynges happen & in another hous dye none as yt is ſayd afore Like wiſe in that place wher the wurtes & coles putrefied it maketh a noyfull ſauour & ſtynking. For like as by the ſwete odour of bawme the herte & the ſpirites laue recreaciō ſo of euyl ſauours they be made feble wherfor kepe your hons that an infect ayer entre not in. for an infect ayer moſt cauſeth putrifacciō in places & houſes wher folk ſlipe therfore lette your hous be clene & make clere fire of wode flaming Lett your hous be made wich fumigacion of herbes whiche be the leuys

of baye tree Ieneper vberiorgany it is ī tha poticaue ſtoppes worm vode rewe nugwort & of the tree of aloes whiche is beſt but it is dere ſuche a fumee taken by the mouthe & eeris openeth thynward ꝑtes of the body Alſo it is teſchew all grete replecions becauſe ful bodies be lightly infect as auycēne ſayth in the fourth canō They that chargen their bodies with replecciō ſhorten their lyfe Alſo comyn bathes are to be eſchewed for a litil cruſt corrupteth al the body Therfore the peple aſmoche as is poſſible is to be eſchewd leſt of infect brethes ſom mā be infect But whan the multitude of peple may not be eſchewed then vſe the remedies folowing, In the morning whan ye uſe weſſhe a litil rewe & one or two filberd nottes clene with ſalte & ete thē & if that can not be had then ete brede or a toſte ſopped ī vinegre namely in troubeloꝰ & cloudy weder Alſo in time of peſtilēce it is better tabyde within the hous for it is not holſom to go in the cite or town. Alſo ſprenkle your hows ſpecially in ſōmer with vinegre & roſes & with the leuys of vyn tree Alſo it is gode to waſſhe often times in the day your hādes with wat &

vinegre & wipe your face with your handes & ſmelle to thē Alſo it is gode alway to ſauo aygre thinges. In the mount of peſſulane I might not eſchewe the ꝯpany of peple for I wēt fro hous to hous becāe of my poute to cureſeke folkes therfore brede or a ſponge ſopped in vinegre I toke with me holding it to my mouth & noſe becauſe al egre thinges ſtoppen the wayes of humours & ſuffreth no venemous thinges to ent into a mānys body & ſo I eſcaped the peſtilence my felows ſuppoſing that I ſhold not liue Theſe thinges I haue ꝓued by my ſelf

thinges vſed ye may go ſurely emōg the peple Alſo a natural laxe of the bely is a grete remedy ellis ꝓuoke a laxe by a ſuppoſitory craftely Vſe pipille peſtilenciales for they be gode they be in thappoticary ſhoppes Alſo kepe fire al way in your hous. for it letteth moche thin pſſions of the bodies aboue & clarefied thaier Alſo it is ꝓffitable aſwel for hole & ſeke folkes to drinke Triacle: therfore take it .ij. times a daye with clere wyn lymphat or with clere roſewater or with clere ale: Take a quā

is more to pleſe than hote odour or ſauo. alſo garlik though it purgeth fleame & put out euyl humour & ꝓuoked an appetite to ete & ſuffreth no drye ayer to entre: yet it troubleth the eyen & maketh the hede hote. therfore it is not gode to ete garlik The peſtilēce groweth of ten times of an hote cauſe therfore all̄ metes the lighter they be of digeſtion ſomoche they be the better In the mornyng ete boilled mete / at euyn roſted / forbere broth & potage without they he eygre In the time of peſtilence eygre metes be moche better thanne other metes. Alſo forbere al frutes but if they be eygre as cheryes or pomes garnates or a litil of a pere or apple by waye of medicine becauſe al frute enduceth putrifaccion Ete conuenient ſpyces as gynger cynamum comyn matis & ſaffron Theſe be the beſt ſauſe that may be made for riche peple For poure take rewe ſage filberdnuts ꝑcelly with vinegre mynſt to gider. Theſe be gode & letteth putrifacciō To be mery ī the herte is a grete remedie for helth of body Therfore īn time of peſtilence beware ye drede not deth: but lyue merely & hope to lyue longe

I ſay that ī peſtilence time anon after mete yf a body liſt to ſlepe then ſuche luſt ſhalbe forborn̄ by a ſpace walking ī the gardyns or feldes & then make a naturell ſlepe by the ſpace of an houre & therfore Auycenne writeth that if a mā wold ſlepe he muſt drinke a gode draught of ale or wyn befor becauſe a man being a ſlepe draweth many humours & the euil humours be putt doun by thumours of a gode draught But ſom wold aſke

how may a mā fele when he is infect. I ſay that a mā whiche is enfect that day eteth not moche mete for he is repleniſſhed with euyl humoure & forthwith after dyn he hath luſt to ſlepe & feleth grete hete vnder colde. alſo he hath grete payne ī the forhede / but all th
