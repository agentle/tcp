                     For first I came to Hounds-dich,
                     then round about I crept:
                     Where cruelty is crowned chiefe,
                     and piety fast a sleepe,
                     Where Usury gets profit,
                     and brokers beare the bel,
                     Oh fie vpon this deadly sinne,
                     it sinkes the house to hel.

                     And one his necke a trusse of peles,
                     tipped al with hornes.
                     With care he is not cumbred,
                     he liueth not in dread:
