For ſay they not that it is for anye man or woman impoſſible to lyue chaſt? to loue theyr enemyes, to lyue ſoberlye or Chriſtianlye? O God, how is Uſury and Symony cloked? how is intemperate lyuynge vſed and eſtemed? Howe do men kepe the chaſtitie of Matrimonye: How do men paye vnto God and his myniſters theyr tythes? what charitable dedes, what frutefull penaunce, yea, what murder, adulterie, and fornicacion, what bybbynge, and bancketynge, clene contrary to Gods commaundements is there vſed? For nowe to drynke ſunder ſnoeuen is a vertue, to kepe a concubyne, is not muche blamed, to ſeke vpon caulkers and diuiners

is comenly vſed, to be proud, is accepted for clenlynes, to be auaricious, for prouldēee, to be crafty and deceytful, for polycie, to ſpende and waſte, for good felowſhyp, to ſkoffe and ieſte, for a poynt of ciuilitie, to flatter, is taken for intier loue and amitie. O Lord ſhall theſe men come to thee euerlaſtynge be atitude? ſhal they ſe the Kyng in his eſtate and maieſte? no verely. Who then? He that lyueth iuſtlye, Eſay, 33 and ſpeaketh thee trueth: he that abhorreth to do iniuries couetouſly, and remoueth awaye his handes frome gyftes, he y• ſtoppeth his eares, leaſte he here the deceytefull oppreſſyon of the innocents bloude, and that ſhutteth his eyes, leſt he ſe euyll: this man

ſhall inhabite places, & ſe the kynge in his gloryous eſtate. Why do not men folowe the ſayinges and wordes of the prophete? Whye do they not enſue the doctrine of famous doctours and preachers? There was neuer more ſincere and trewe preachynge, than is nowe of late, nor the worde of God more ſpoken of, then is in theſe our dayes. But ſo muche preachynge, & ſo lytle folowynge, ſo muche exhortacion to charite, and ſo feable & weake loue, ſo much perſwaſion to ſouccoure and ayde the poore, and ſo greate pouettie, ſo much good counſel gyuen to enſe we vertue, & ſo lytell apprehended & vſed, was neuer ſene. Why ſo? For euery man (as now y• worlde

is faſhioned) be he neuer ſo rude and vnlearned, wyll be his owne doctour, his owne interpreter of ſcriprure, and folow his owne ſenſe and opinion, his owne maner of liuing and pleaſure, cleane cō
                     trary to al wyſdome, reaſon, and good learnyng. The old auncient fathers, and trewe interpreters of Gods holye worde, the maſters of vertuous and godly conuerſacion, are amonge many lytle or no thing regarded. What were they (ſay thei) but men as we be? Truth it is: but yet farre more excellente both in learnynge and vertuous operations thā we be: blyſſed martyrs, holy confeſſours, the choſen ſeruauntes and veſſels of God, the enſuers of his ſteps

and ſtatutes, the reprouers of vyce, men of moſte perfecte life, and the ſincere preachers and expounders of the word of God. For who is he liuing that (as for an enſample) in ſubtilite of wyt, in profounde learnyng, in clere declaration of ſcripture, or in godly example, that may becompared vnto S. Auguſtine? Whoſe warkes are incomparable, & ſinguler in all kindes of good iearnynge: and to reduce mā from vyce to vertue, from the actiue, to the contemplatyue lyfe moſte excellent. Oute of whoſe ſermons, to admoniſh and reuoke the people frome theyr dyſſolute and vitious lyuinge, and to put theym in remembraunce of theyr duetye and vnthankefulnes towardes

god: I haue ſelected and tranſlated theſe certaine ſermones, the which in mine opinion and minde, are moſt worthy, and moſt neceſſarye to be knowen and had in memorye, but to be folowed, much more neceſſary. Deſyrynge your hyghnes thankfully to accepte this my rude tranſlation. Rude it is (I cō

my brethren doo not theſe thinges, do not deceaue your ſelues, gyue no place to the Deuyl, in youre aſſebles, but rather prepare & make your ſelues, a dwellynge place for Chryſte, Therefore gyue not your ſelfs without to fables, but within the Churche to pſalmodi and prayers, braul not one with a nother in the churche but be quiet. There are many, and ſpecially women, the which do ſo chatter, and in ſuch wyſe do braule in the churche that they nether here the diuine leſſons them ſefes, neyther ſuffer other to heare them. Shuld there be ſuch meting with ſuch an order in gods houſe? or is it decent or comelye ſo to aſſyſte and ſtand in the ſight of god,

and of his holy angells? And yet I wyl further complaine me with you, y• which thinge is generallye to be ſeruid and morenyd. For why there are certayne, and ſpecyallye the greate eſtates of thys world, the whyche commynge vnto the churche, are not deuoute and readye to laude & prayſe God, but to conſtrayne the preſte to abreuiat hys maſſe, and to ſynge as it ſhal pleaſe them: nor it is not lewefull for hym thrughe theyr glotonye and couituſnes to folowe the eccleſiaſticall faſhyon & maner: ſoo that one lytle moment of the daye, ſhoulde be deputed and ſuffyſe to the ſeruice of God, and the reſte of the daye and the nyght to

For they peryſhe not onelye that doo theſe thinges, but they alſo that conſente vnto the doers of the ſame. Therfore beware before all thing, that ye nether pleade nor iudge no maters vpon the feſtiual and holye dayes: but at other tymes and with iuſtice.

For he that doeth thynke onelye vppon this lyfe, is compared and likened vnto a beaſt. For what other thinge doe beaſtes care for, but onelye to eate and drynke, to ſlepe, and to lyue voluptuouſlye? And euen ſuch as are all they that thynke moore vppon theyr bodyes, then vppon theyr ſoules, that loue glottonye and lecherye. more then iuſtyce or chaſtitie. Therefore my dearely beloued yemuſt vnderſtande, and knowe

that we are made chriſtians to thynke continually vppon the eternall world, & reward that is to come, and to labor more for the ſoule, then for y• bodye. Our fleſhe ſhal continue but for a fewe yeares in this wolde, but oure ſoules (yf we lyue and do well) ſhal inherite heauen wtoute ende. But yf we do euyll workes, (that God forbyd) and labor more for bodelye pleaſure, then for the helth or ſaluation of our ſoules, I feare me that when good men ſhall be receyued with the aungelles vnto eternall lyfe, that we (that god forbyd) ſhalbe caſte headlyng into hel fyer. Good brethren: it is not ynoughe that we haue receyued a chriſten name, excepte that therwith,

we do good chriſtē mēs workes. To hym it is ryghte profitable to be called a chriſtiane, that loueth chaſtitie, that exchueth ebrietie, that abhorreth pryde, and that as very poiſon doth reiect enuy. He is a ryghte good Chriſten man, that ſtealethe not, that beareth no falſe witnes, that lyeth not, that vſethe no periury, that committeth no adultery, that dothe frequente the churche, that doeth not taſte of his fruytes, vntyll he fyrſt haue offered part of thē vnto God, that doth pay his tythes yearelye, to be deſtributed amonge the nedy, that doth loue his curate, and honoureth preiſtes, that loueth euery man as hym ſelfe, and hateth no man. Uerelye he is

not onely a chriſten mā that doth feare and exchewe as the ſword of Satan, deceitfull weyghtes, & double meaſures, but chriſt him ſelf doth alſo dwele in hym. He is a good chriſtiane, that cōming to the churche, doth exhibite and offereth vp his offeringe and that after his poſſibilitie and ſubſtaunce, dothe geue a peny, or a morſell of bread to ſome poore man, that receyuyth the pore into his houſe: that waſſheth the pore mens fete, that doth not only make no debate, but reduceth ſuch as are at diſcorde and ſtryfe, to vnitie and concorde, that doth ſhewe reuerence, and y• loue of vnfayned charitie vn to his frendes & elders, that doth lyue chaſt, and admonynyſheth

his chyldren, and his neighboures with word and dede, in ſobriete and chaſtite. He is a good Chriſten man, that as ofte as the holye and ſolemne feaſtes drawe nere, doth certayne dayes before, abſtayne and keepe chaſtitie with his wyfe, that the more conueniently, & with a more ſincere and ſure conſcience, a chaſte body, and a clean hart he may come vnto the Lordes borde and table. And he lykewyſe that can the lordes prayer, and his crede by rote, & that faythfully dothe teach his children the ſame. Nowe good brethren ye haue herde who be good chriſtians, and therefore let vs wyth Gods ayde and helpe, doe the beſte we can or may, that this chriſten

name be not wrongfully and vaynely in vs, and that Chryſtes ſacramentes ſuffer no iniury in vs, but in hearte let vs continually thynke vp pon good Chriſten workes, and in dede fulfyll them.

Suche a one doeth not

feare nother to ſteale, nor yet to commyt adultery, to geue falſe wytnes, to curſe, nor yet to commit periury. But whether they be men or women that exerciſe and dooe ſuche vngodly workes, they nether receaue the name of a chriſtian, nor yet the ſacramente of baptyſme, to theyr ayde and conſolation, but to theyr iudgement and damnatiō, And without they repente theym and do penaunce, they ſhall peryſhe for euer: Nowe good brethren I haue opened vnto you, whoo be good, and who be euyl chryſtians. And therfore folowe thoſe that ye ſe and perceaue to be good: & chaſten, chyde, and correcte thoſe ye knowe to be nought yt through your owne vtilitie

For they that are good chaſt, ſober, hūble, and gentle, wyll by the grace of God, continue iu theyr good and godly workes, and the myſlyuers, quyckelye or euer they departe from hence, a mend them ſelues, for yf they die without repentaūce, they ſhall not come to ioye, but to perpetuall and euerlaſtynge deathe, from the which God vouchſafeto delyuer vs. So be it.

I ſay vnto you, inaſmuche as ye haue done it vnto on of the leſt of theſe, ye haue done it to me. O the gret be nignitie and goodnes of god the which to repreſſe and aſſwage the couetouſneſſe of man ſaith that whatſoeuer is

geuen to the leaſt poore man that is, is geuen vnto hym ſelfe. The goodnes of God graunte you my brethren yt ye maye ſo ſerue and pleaſe him with youre abſtinence, almes dedes, & good workes: that he the which doth lyue eternallye, may brynge you to the eternall and true lyfe. So be it.
               
               
                  
                     Ser, 62,¶ Of faſtynge in Lent,  and almes dedes. v. Ser.
                  
                     I Praye you, & in like maner I admoniſh you my derely beloued brethren, yt none of you do preſume to dyne in

this lawfull and moſte holye tyme of Lent, except it be vpon the ſundaye, or that paraduenture ye be in ſuch care and weakeneſſe, that your in firmitie & ſickenes do the not ſuffer you to faſt. For why, to faſt vppon other dayes, is either a remedye, or elles a rewarde, but not to abſteine in lent, is ſynne. He that at anye other tyme dothe faſte, ſhall haue pardon and remiſſion, but he that doth not faſt and abſtayne in Lente, ſhall fele payne. And yet let hym, that through feblenes cannot faſt prepare ſomewhat as ſecretlye as maye be, for hym ſelfe and other (yf there be any modiſeaſed than hym ſelfe) that they maye eate it together. But he ſhall inuyte nor call

none ſuch to hys repaſt & dinner, that mai faſt: Forif he do both god and man ſhal eaſely perceaue, that hys infirmitie is not the cauſe that he faſteth not, but that throughe glutteny he wil not faſt. Let him y• can not faſt, be content & eate his meate withſorowfulnes, that he when other men do abſteyne and faſt, abſtayneth not. Let hym cauſe the thinge that ſhalbe neceſſary for the ſicke, to be ſecretly prepared for him ſelfe and ſome other. For it beſemeth hym not to cal any whole mā vnto his table, leſte that he, through other mēs gluttony encreaſe and augmente hys owne ſynne. And yet foraſmuche as he faſteth not, hys charitie and almoſe oughe to

be the more large to the pore, ſo to redeme thoſe ſynnes by almoſe dedes, the whiche he coulde not cure nor heale, by abſtinence and faſtynge. It is my good brethren a verye good and a profitable thing to faſte, but yet much better to gyue almoſe. Yf a man may or cando both they are two good thynges but yf he cannot, better it is to gyue almoſe. Yf thou be not able to faſt, almoſe dedes without faſtyng ſhalbe ſufficient, but to faſt without doing of charitable and almoſe dedes, is not ſufficiente.
                  Therefore yf a man can not faſt, almoſe wythout faſtinge is good, but yf a manne may faſte, and alſo do hys almoſe they are two good thinges,

but to faſt without doing of almes, is nother good, nor profitable, excepte a man be ſo very nedy and poore, that he haue nothynge at all to geue, and then the good will of hym that hath nothing to gyue, is ſufficiente. For it is wrytten, Glorye to God an hyghe, and peace be on the erth to thoſe that be wel willinge. Luke, 2, But who can excuſe hym, when the lord hath promyſed to gyue vs a rewarde Mat, 10, for a cuppe of cold water?
                  And why doth he ſay of colde water? leaſte peraduenture ſome pore man would excuſe him ſelfe by penury and lack of woode, and ſaye that he hath nother potte nor panne to warme any water withal Finally my derelye beloued

brethren, the lord dothe ſo exhorte, and ſo admoniſh vs by the holy prophet to do almes dedes, that there is in a maner no man ſo pore and nedy, that can excuſe hym ſelfe: He ſayth thus. This is the faſte, (ſayth the Lord) that I haue Eſay, 58, choſen, breake thy breade to hym that is an hungered. He ſayth not, gyue hym a whole loafe, for perchaunce the pore man hath it not to geue, but he ſayth, breake it, that is to ſaye, yf thou be ſo nedye and pore, yt thou haſt but one lofe of bread, yet breake of a pece thereof, & geue it to the pore. Alſo he ſayth, leade the poore

to fede the poore, yet at leſt wiſe, let hym prepare hym a bedde in ſome corner of hys houſe. O my deare brethren, what ſhal we ſai to theſe thinges, or what excuſe ſhall we make, that haue gret & wyde houſes? and yet ſcarely voucheſafe at any time to receaue the poore pilgrime, being ignoraunt, yea not beleuyng that chryſte (as he doth ſaye) is receaued in his pylgrymes I was a ſtraunger, and ye receaued Mat, 25, me, and inaſmuch as ye haue done it vnto one of the leſt of theſe, ye haue done it vnto me. It is tedious and laboriouſe vnto vs, to receaue Chriſt in pore and neadye menne, into oure countreye, but I feare me he wyll requite vs, & not receaue vs

into this heuenly kingdom. We diſpiſe him here in thys worlde, I feare me he wil deſpiſe vs in heauē. As he hī ſelfe doth ſaye, I was a hungred and ye gaue me no meate, I was a ſtraunger, and ye did Eſay, 58, not receaue me. Inaſmuche then as ye did it not to one of the leſte of theſe, ye did it not Ezec, 18, to me. But I beſeche GOD my good brethrē, that he may remoue from vs, the thynge that doth enſue and folowe: for afterwardes he ſaythe: Gette ye from me ye wycked & dāned perſones into yt eternall Mat. 25, & euerlaſting fire, y• whiche is prepared for ſarā & his angels. Therfore my brethrē let vs not heare theſe things ſlightly, or wt our bodely ears onely, but faithfully hering it

let vs ſo teache it with word & dede, that other men maye vnderſtande it, & accompliſh the ſame. Our Lorde Chryſt Jeſu grauntinge it, the whiche liueth and reygneth with the father and the holy goſt. So be it.

becauſe we can not be otherwiſe ſaued, except yt we being penitente, do penitently confeſſe, that we negligentelye haue cōmitted. Sathan ſhal not accuſe him agayne at domes daye, that dothe here of his ſinful dedes, and vngodly life, accuſe him ſelfe, ſo that he be confeſt, and penitently doth leaue and forſake them, & renueth them not agayne.

God dothe deſyre our confeſſion, that there by he might haue a ful and a perfect knowledge of our miſde des, He that is aſhamed to di cloſe and to confeſſe hys ſinnes, ſhall haue God both his iudge, and hys punyſher. A man ſhall do beſt to iudg him ſelfe in this worlde, leſte that God here after iudge him to 1, Cor, 11 perpetuall payne and tormēt Euerye ſinfull man ought to haue double ſorowe in penaunce, fyrſte, that throughe his negligēce he did no good and agayne that throughe a certayne boldnes he committed yt thing which was euyll That he ſhuld not haue done he did, & yt he ſhuld haue done

And firſt let the hert be penitente and ſorowfull for all ſuche vngodlye thynges as it hath at any tyme thought vpon or deſired: lette the eye wepe, lette the mouthe praye coutinuallye, lette the

eare heare the worde of god, let the hands geue and be doing of charitable and almoſe dedes: receaue the poore pylgrime, fede the ſicke and hongri, and cloth the naked, lette youre fete be goinge to the churche, & youre knees labor to bowe downe vnto god, for as ther was no member but that throughe ſynne hath diſpleaſyd god, ſo let ther be no membre without ſufferaūce of ſemblabe and lyke payne, for god hath geuen vs oure mēbers to ſerue him withall and not to ſerue the world. But alas my brethren, the citezens of heauen, and gods familiare frendes, are made the ſeruauntes of the world, embraſyng & leanyng a grete deale more to earthly things

then to eternal, to theyr own ſubſtaunce, then to them ſelues. But good brethren, ye ſhulde not do ſo, for why, the time is at hand, and it doeth threten vs, Ryſe ye vp therefore Pſal 126 that do eate the bread of heauines. Let vs haſte vs to the churche, and with ſorowfull teares confeſſe oure ſynnes. But firſt this order muſt be takē and kept. We (or euer we go to cōfeſſiō) muſt think vpon our ſynnes and treſpaſſes, and in opening of thē, ſo confeſſe to god, and to his miniſter the prieſte the maner & circumſtaunces of them, that we maye departe from theyr fete not burdened, but exone rated & lightened. And good brethren, looke ye prolongue not the time, to confeſſe your

ſinnes, for he that doeth prolongne or procraſtinate the time vnto the laſt day of lent, or of his life to cōfeſſe his miſdedes▪ he geueth good euydence, that he doth it not willyngly, nor gratiouſlye, nor with a pure hart, but againſt his will. Marke and cōſider howe ſuch conſtrayned and vnwillynge ſeruyce doth pleaſe ether god or mā. And therfore let vs not delay frō daye to day to confeſſe and to opē the ſecretes of oure heartes, for God hath promyſed forgeuenes to thoſe that are penitent, and not to thoſe that delaye theyr confeſſion or penaunce vntyl to morow: therfore let vs not prolonge nor delaye our confeſſion. But yet whē thou man or womā

And therefore my brethren, feare ye not to confeſſe youre ſynnes, for I knowe

that thyng leſſe, the whiche I knowe by confeſſion, then that, whiche I knowe not. Why do ye then feare to confeſſ your ſinnes? he is a wretched ſinner as ye are, and perchaunce a more wretched ſinner then ye are, that dothe here your confeſſion. He is a manne: he differeth nothing from you, he is but as ye are. Why doſt thou then thou ſinfull man feare to confeſſe the to a ſynner? Chooſe what ye wyll but yf ye lurke vnconfeſſed, ye ſhalbe condemned withoute confeſſion. GOD doeth require confeſſion, to acquite and deliuer him that is humble, and to condemne him eternallye, that is prowde. Be confeſte my brethrē and delaye it not, haſte you

to come to the holy harueſt of confeſſion, for cōfeſſion is the Confeſſion, helth of the ſoule, the deſtroier of vyce, the reſtorer of vertue, the victor & ouercomer of fendes▪ the feare of hell: the obſtacle of ſatan, the cote and garment of aungels, the hope of the churche, the helth the gyde, the light, the eſperaunce and hope of al faythfull people; O wonderful and holy confeſſiō, thou doſt cloſe vp the mouth of hel, and openeſt heauen gates. O confeſſion, without the, the iuſt mā is eſtemed vnthankfull, and the ſynner ſhalbe reputed as deade. O the lyfe of al iuſte men, the glorye of all ſinners, Thou art onely neceſſary for ſynners, and yet he that wyl be eſtemed iuſt, muſte oftentimes

viſit the. Finally there ſhal nothing remayne in iudgement that was auoyded & diſcloſed by confeſſion. Clene and pure confeſſion is ſo pondered and wayde, and God doth ſet ſo muche and ſuche ſtore thereby, that the theues confeſſion hanging vpon the croſſe, was aſwel accepted as though he had died for gods cauſe: be holde howe muche ye ſynners ſhort confeſſion dyd auauntage him? But we priſtes (would to god we were good preiſtes) ſhoulde ſo diligently, and with ſuch mode ratiō watch to faſten y• word of feare, & of contrition in the heartes of ſynners, that we feare them not from confeſſiō and ſo to opē theyre heartes, that they not her ſhut vp, nor

For the beleife of the hearte iuſtyfyeth & the confeſſion of the mouth Roma, 10 maketh a manne ſaufe. And therefore he that hathe the worde of confeſſyon in hys mouth, and not in his heart, is other craftye, or ells falſe. And he that hathe it in hys heart, and not in his mouth, is other prowde or fearefull. Therefore it behouethe preiſtes to bee ſuche as doo knowe what maner of medycine and howe muche therof they ſhould miniſter to euerye ſycke manne, The Lorde which lyueth and reygnethe for euer, being hys ayde and

                     Ser, 57,¶ Of Penaunce. Ser. viii. 
                  
                     I Praye you my dearely beloued brethren, that if anye of you after ye courſe and fraileneſſe of mā, be ouerthrowen through the ſubtill craftines of Satā, or inwrappedī dedelye ſynne▪ and hath (as ſayeth the Apoſtle) deſtroied in him ſelfe the temple of god. I pray 2, Cor, 3 him that he deſpere not of the mercy of God, but that he ariſe vp quicklye from his iniquitie and ſinne, leſt yt by the cōtinuaunce & cuſtom therof

he drowne him ſelfe in hys owne ruine, for he ſhal not be odious nor abhominable vnto god, that hath done & committed ſinne, but he that doth reſte and contynue in ſynne. And becauſe no man ſhoulde miſtruſt the mercy of god, the Lorde by his prophete dothe comforte vs ſaying, I deſire Ezec, 33, not the death of anye ſynner but that he ſhuld returne frō ſinne and lyue. And agayne Ezec, 18, Whenſoeuer the wicked ſynner ſhal returne from his wickednes, yt ſhall not hynder nor hurte hym. But thys his greate mercy doth then profite vs, whē we ſlacke not to returne vnto him: nor ioyne nor accumulate ſynne vpon ſinne. Furthermore we may knowe the woundes and fractures

of y• body, by the woū
                     des and fracturs of the ſoule. For yf a mans legge, or hand be once broken, it is wont to be hardely brought and reſtored to hys olde vſe agayne, but yet if they breake twiſe or thriſe, or oftener in one place, your charitie maye eaſely vnderſtand and perceaue wyth what dolor and payne ſuche woundes and fractures are healed agayne: and yet after longe payne & torment: ſcarcely they can be reſtored and brought to theyr former and olde eſtate. And lyke reaſon is thought to be in the fractures and wondes of the ſoule▪ for yf a man do commit ſinne once or twyſe, and without any diſſimulation doth fly vnto the remedy of penance, he

ſhal without any let, and per aduenture without any ſhāe recouer his helth again. But if ſynne beginne to be ioined to ſinne, and that the woun: des of the ſoule, throughe the clokyng and defending of iniquitie do rather putrify thē by confeſſion and penance do heale and amende, it is to be fearde, leſt the ſayinge of the Apoſtle be verified in hym. Doſt thou not knowe, that ye kindnes of god doth lead the Roma, 2, to repentaunce, but thou after thine hard heart that cannot rēpente, doſt hepe together the treaſure of wrath agaynſt the day of vengeaūce and reuelation of the tru iudgement of GOD. But perchaunce ſome one man maye think, that he hath ſo greuouſlye

offended, that now he cā
                     not merite to haue and to obtayne the mercy of God. But God forbid that anye ſinner ſhould thinke ſoo. O thou mā that doth conſider and waye the multitude of thy ſynnes, why in like maner doſte thou not conſider the great power of the celeſtial phiſition? And conſidering that God of hys mere goodnes wyl haue mercy vpon vs, and that by hys myghtye power, he maye be mercifull vnto vs. He doe the clooſe vp the gate of hys dyuyne mercy agaynſt him ſelfe that doth beleue that GOD wyl not, or that he can not be merciful vnto him, or that miſtruſteth him to be good & omnipotent. And therfore let no man nother after a hundred

yet a thouſand ſinnes and crimes committed, deſpere of Gods mercy, but make al the haſte he can, that God with oute any ſtoppe or let may be merciful vnto him leſt that▪ he perchaunce do ſo accuſtome him ſelf to ſinne, that though he would, he can not be delyuered from the ſnares & craftye deceytes of the deuyl. Dauid (the whiche was both by the ayde and gyfte of God) a 2, Regū, 11, 12, kynge and a Prophete was ſo preuented, that he committed not onely adultery, but alſo murder, and yet he reſerued not him ſelfe, nor protracted nor taried not to do penaunce in his old age▪ but by and by, lyinge in a ſhurte of heare, and ouer ſprinckled wt aſſhes did ſorowfull & greate

penaunce, and fulfylled that he ſayde in his Pſalmes: I wyll waſſhe and water my Pſal, 6, couche euery night with my teares. And agayne, I dyd eate aſſhes as bread, and watered my brinke with teares. And becauſe that with mortiferous Pſa, 101 vncarefulnes he dyd not delaye to do frutefull penaūce, he immediatly ſo ſtird vp and reuoked the mercy of God, that alonely he loſt not his kingdome, but alſo deſerued to receaue and to haue y• gift of the holy cōt̄orter. But peraduenture there be yet ye wil ſay, I am ocupied in warfare, or I haue a wyfe, howe can I then do penaunce? As though that I (when I coū
                     ſel you to do penaunce) wold ſay, that ye ſhulde rather go

aboute to plucke out the heares of your heades, then that ye ſhould leaue youre ſynnes & wretchednes, or vnthrede youre gownes, then to refuſe your euyll conuerſation & maners. But let him whiche goeth about by ſuch diſſimulation more to deceaue then to excuſe hym ſelfe, take hede, & marke, that nether the honor of his kingdome, nor yet the dignitie of his apparel, could refrayne or let kynge Dauyd from doing of penaunce. Alſo the ſacrilegius kyng Achab 3, Regū, 21, (of whome Scrypture ſayth) that there was neuer none ſuche ſolde to do eutil againſt God) after yt Jezebell his wife had depraued him & had made him abhominable in the ſight of God, Naboth

being ſtoned to deth, becauſe he wold not yeld vp his vine yard, yet after yt the Prophet Heli had ſpoken vnto him, he put on a ſhyrte of heare, & bowed downe his heade vnto god, & did penaunce. Where vpon god ſaid vnto Heli, haſt thou not ſeene, how yt Achab hath humiliated him ſelfe vn to me? Foraſmuch as he (ſaith the lorde) hath buxomed and bowde him ſelfe vnto me for my ſake (I wil not as long as he ſhal liue) punyſhe nor trouble the people Now conſider good brethren, that although this Achab was ſacrilegius & naughtes, yet he prolonged not the time to do penaunce, but incontynently offerd vnto GOO the ſacryfice of an hūble and of a cōtrite heart,

And if afterwards he hadde continued in his humylytye, the mercye of GOD, had neuer forſaken him. Alſo kyng Manaſſes was ſo wycked, 4, re, 21, as it is wrytten of hym: that he repleniſhed the whole citie of Hieruſalem with al in iquitie, yet after yt he was taken & put in priſon, he throgh greate penaunce and muche humilitie, dyd ſo obtayne the grace and fauour of god, that he merited to be numbred & accepted amōg the frendes & good louers of god, And after yt theſinneful Magdalene Luc, 7, (the which waſſhed Chriſtes fete with her teares, & wype them with her heare knewe that the heauenlye Phiſition was come, ſhe went into Simons houſe vndeſired, & ſhe

that before was bold, prompt & ſhameles vnto all vnthriftines, was nowe more bold to be ſaued, and therefore ſhe deſerued to heare, that all her ſynnes were forgeuen her.
                  Nor this woman prolonged not to d
                        •
                      penaunce, but why leſt ſhe might ſinne, ſhe did ſo leue of to ſinne, that no neceſſirie, but her owne voluntary will withdrue her from her miſliuing. We might find manye mo in holy ſcripture, the which through doinge of penaunce after their infinite & innumerable crymes, prouoked and cauſed god to be mercifull and gratious Lord vnto them, the which did not only returne to their firſt eſtate and condition, but to a much better. But foraſmuch as it

were a very longe thinge to ſpeake of al, theſe fowre whiche we haue recited & ſpoken of, al ſufficient to know that the lorde (the which forgaue Dauid after ſo great a ſinne, and the ſacrilegius Kynge Achab) and that after ſo innumerable iniquities reputed penitent Manaſſes to be his frende, and forgaue the ſinful Magdalen, which did waſh his fete with her teares, and did wipe thē with her heare al her ſinnes is ready not only to forgeue vs oure myſdedes and treſpaſſes, yf we returne vnto hym, but alſo to geue vs eternall beatitude, & reſt euerlaſting. Therfore mi good brethren, let vs (thynkyng vpon thoſe thynges) la boure with Gods helpe, as

much as we maye poſſible, yt no deadly ſin crepe in amōge vs, but yf ſo be there be any, yt througe yt deceytfulnes of the deuil are ouerthrowē or eaſt into this euill, let him or euer any ſuch crimes by a cō
                     tynual cuſtome do encreaſe, ſeke for remedy, and laboure wyth greate ſorowfulnes of hearte, to be reconſiled, & to wyn the fauour of almightye God againe. Nor let him not be aſhamed to do penaunce, yt was not aſhamed to ſynne, but ſtryue incontinently thorough godly operation to a mende him ſelfe, that he may be knowen, and accepted of the father amonge hys chyldren, leſte that he exclude hym from the eternall blyſſe

and eiecte him from the heauenly banket, and boūd both hand and foote, caſte him into the exterioure darkenes, where is waylyng and gnaſſhyng Mat, 2

                        , of teth, and that he reuoked, and throughe the medecines of penaunce, humilytie, and cōpunction, reſtored to hys olde eſtate and helthe agayne, and adourned wyth the perylls of good workes, maye meryte to heare theſe wordes. O my good and faythfull ſeruaunt, enter and come into the ioye of thy lord

But ſome wyll ſay vnto me. I am a poore man, & not able to do any almoſe dedes. But becauſe yt no poore man ſhoulde excuſe himſelfe from doing of almoſe dedes, our Sauiour hath promyſed to rewarde vs for a cuppe of colde water. Sayſt thou thē

And therfore help thy ſelfe (O thou chriſten mā) that doeſte reade and heare theſe thynges, with Daniels Daiu, 4, moſt holy counſel. Accept my counſel (ſayth he) and redeme thy ſoule with almoſe & charytable dedes. The whyche counſell, yf thou wylt not lyſten to and heare, thou ſhalte call vpon God, but in vayne. O thou ſoule that doſte inhabite and dwell within theſe carnal & frayle wales, watch praye, aſke, ſeke, and knocke. Math, 7. I ſay watch aſking, pray ſekyng, and knocke workyng, The Lorde ſhall aunſwere thee, that doeſte watche and aſke, ſayinge, beholde here I am. If thou wylt pearce and

go thorowe the fire, thy lorde God is with thee, & the flame Eſay, 43, ſhall not burne the. For why, as water doth quench fire, euē ſo doth almoſe dede quenche ſynne. Therefore yf thou Eccle, 3, wylte open thy hande to the poore, Chryſte ſhall open hys gates vnto the, that as a poſſeſſioner of heuen thou maiſt enter & come in. And yf thou thynke that the ende of the worlde be long a commynge, loke onely vpon thyne owne ende, and beholde howe the worlde by a lytle and a lytle doth conſume and vaniſh. Al thynges whyche were good, are gone and taken away, & ſuch euyll as neuer was doth approche. The thing that the word of God dyd pronoſtycate, is dayly accompliſhed &

Therefore take counſel whileſt that thou haſt thy redemption in thyne owne hande, geue and diſtribute vnto thy ſelfe that is thyne, whyleſte it is thyne. For the thinge that thou doeſt poſſeſſe and hold, is but frayle and bryttle▪ and other mens that thou doeſte loke for.

The rych man lefte in thys world hys ware houſes and ſhoppes full of goodes and great ſubſtance, and in hell, he deſired but a drope of water, and coulde not obtayne it. Take hede good brethren, the whole body of this

rych man is troubled wyth the flames and fire of hell, & yet his tonge (becauſe wyth prowde wordes he deſpiſed the poore man) is moſt vehemently tormēted. The tonge which wold not counſell him to geue the poore manne his almoſe, is mooſte greuouſlye burnte and punyſhed wyth the fire and flames of hell▪ He cryde out and ſayde: Father Abraham, ſende Lazarus that he maye dyppe hys fynger in water, and cole my tounge. O thou ryche man, with what audacitie & boldneſſe dareſte thou require a droppe of water, that wouldeſte not profer a crome of breade? Thou ſhouldeſt now euen of ryghte haue demaunded and aſked it, yf thou haddeſt

He is wrong, and crieth out, and ſayth. O moſt pure and ryghteous iudge, other let my paines be recompenſyd, accordynge to myne iniquities, or els lette me receaue condinge punyſhment and payne for the tyme, that I was in wealth, or double payne, or foure tymes more payne.

Thou dyddeſt no almoſe dedes, the which might haue quenched the tormentes Eccle, 3, & paines, that thou doeſt nowe abyde and ſuffer for thy ſynnes and iniquytyes. Scrypture did call vpon the but thou wouldeſt not here. The propheres hold not ther peace. The apoſtles preched, The goſpel gaue out his ſoftd The tormentes and paynes prepared for the ſynnefull

there are that thynke it lawe full for men or euer they be maried to committe fornication, but not for wemen. Many there are, the whyche not fearynge God, do commytte theſe crymes, moſte greuous and moſt worthy to be puniſſhed, becauſe they are common, and cuſtomablye vſed, and ſo litle eſtemed, that men nowe a dayes doo not reken them to be enorme and wycked treſpaſſes. But yet in the catholyke fayth, whatſoeuer is vnlawefull for women, is vtterly vnlawefull for men. For why, both men and women are redemed wyth one pryce, that is▪ with the precious bloude of Chryſte. They are called to one faythe, & are gathered together in one miſtical

body of the church, they receaue the ſacrament of baptime together, they come together vnto the aulter to receaue the holy communion of the body and bloud of chryſt, and the commaundementes are geuen equally vnto them both. Seinge then that it is ſo, with what boldnes, or cō
                     ſcience do men beleue yt they onely may do that thing vnpuniſhed, the which is nether lawfull for man to do, nor yet for womā. But I wold that al ſuch as preſume to do ſuch deteſtable thynges, ſhoulde wel and perfectly know, that yf they do not for the with amende themſelues, and doo the fruytefull workes of penaunce, but dye ſodenly, that without doubte or remedye,

they ſhall be troubled wyth perpetuall fire. But what a thinge is this, for many therbe, whiche are not aſhamed, or euer they be maryed too kepe concubynes, the whiche they forſake wythin feawe yeares after and be maryed Fyrſt they do muſe and caſte with them ſelues, howe that throughe deceytfulneſſe and thefte, they maye come to ryches and vnlawful againe, & afterwardes agaynſt all reaſon, they do marye wemen of more nobilitie and ſubſtance thē they thē ſelues be. Mark with howe many euyls they that not onely vnluckedly do deſire to do ſeruice vnto letchery, but alſo to couetouſnes do intangle thēſelues wt al. Therfore I do cōteſt & de

here before God and his aungels, yt he hath alwayes forboden theſe crimes, and that they neuer pleaſyd hym. For ſence ye time of Chryſtes law it was neuer lawefull for mā to kepe aconcubyne, nor neuer ſhalbe. But yet there be that do it by the law of man, but not by Gods lawe, nor yet by iuſtice commaunding, but by the onely pleaſure of ye bodye rulynge them, When the Apoſtle ſayeth to thoſe that be maried, that the time which remaineth is but ſhort 1, Cor, 7, and that they whyche haue wyues, ſhould be althoughe they had none. And agayne, wythdrowe youre ſelfes for a while, that ye may geue yourſelues to prayer. Howe doth he ſuffer men to haue concubines

that doth commaunde them to kepe chaſtitye that are maryed: And therfore I agayne and agayne doo ſaye vnto you, that he, the whiche before he be lawfully maried doth preſume to kepe a concubyne, doth gretely ſynne and treſpaſſe, and more greater ſynne then he, whyche committeth adulterye, for the adulterer dothe it ſecretlye, and fereth, and is aſhamed to do it openly, but he that kepeth a concubyne openlye, dothe thynke that withoute ſhame he maye do in the preſence of al the worlde, ſuche an execrable thynge moſte lawfully But they peraduēture whyche are not defyled nor be ſpotted with thys ſynne, doo ſaye, why be not they that cō

and do ſuche enormyties remoued then frō Gods boorde? Preiſtes verelye punyſhe not ſuche enorme and greate crymes, becauſe that many men do vſe them, but if a feawe in number woulde preſume to do ſuche euil they might and ought not onelye to be remoned from Godes boorde, but alſo frō the ſpech and familiaritie of al chriſten people, as ſayeth the Apoſtle Wyth ſuche a man thou ſhalt 1, Cor, 5, nother eate nor drynke. But yet (as I haue ſayd) the multitude of miſdoers doth let y• preiſte to punyſhe them, althoughe good preyſtes doo what thei may or can, & with continuall and perfect charitye do both ſyghe and praye, that at the leaſt wayes, they

myght by their admonicions and prayers prouoke and induce them to penaunce, the whyche, becauſe of the infynite multytude of them, they coulde nother correct nor punyſhe. And therefore I praye you agayne and agayne, yea and lykewyſe I deſire you, that as he whych woulde be maryed, doth couet and deſire to fynde hys ſpouſe a vyrgine, ſo in like maner, let him vntyll he be maried, kepe hys virginitie, for yf he doo not he ſhall not accepte nor receaue the benediction wyth his ſpouſe. And ſoo the ſcripture ſhalbe fulfylled in hym, whiche Pſa, 10 ſayeth, he would haue no benediction, & it ſhalbe farre from hym. Nowe then yf penaunce do not helpe, what

ſhall become of thys manne? Or what ſhalbe hys iudgement in tyme to come, that in thys worlde was not worthy to receaue the benediction, and to be bleſſed with his ſpouſe? And note thys my brethren, yf they which haue no wyues, throughe kepyng of concubines, or medling with other mens wyues be in ſoo greate daunger, what ſhall they moſt vnfortunates thinke of them ſelues, that perchaunce haue wyues, and yet commytte adulterye and throughe a certayne madnes do deſpere of the iudgement of GOD, nor feare not the paynes of hell, nor drſire not the eternall reward? Uerely yf they were in true and perfecte fayth, they wold beleue

in God, and feare the iudgement that is to come. And this may wel be proued, that all ſuche do beleue and truſte more in man, then they do in God, for where they do ſee, & perceaue that men be, there they do feare to committe adultery, but to do it ſecretlye (where God doth ſee it) they feare not. But yf they had neuer ſoo lytle a ſparke of true fayth, as they ſuffer not their ſeruauntes to treſpas in their owne ſyght and preſence, ſo woulde they not preſume to do and committe adulterye in the preſence and ſyghte of the Lorde their God. But of theſe ſpeaketh the holy gooſt by the Prophet. The vnwiſe pſa, 13, &, 52, man ſayde in his hearte and mynde, there is no God: For

thys is withoute peraduenture, that he beleuethe not, y• there is a God, whych ſecretlye dothe thoſe thynges in gods ſyghte and preſence, the which he feareth to do in the preſence and ſight of manne. But yt wrtche knowethe not that the face and anger of Pſa, 3

But perchaunce ſome do ſaye thus, howe can I that throughe my greate buſyneſſe, or by the kynges commaundement am abſent from my wyfe ſo manye monethes or yeares kepe chaſtitie? Unto thys I maye geue thys aunſwere, that he retourne home vnto hys wyfe. But when I aunſwere the merchaunt ſo, he ſayeth, that

yf he leaue of the feate of merchaundiſe, he ſhal not be able to lyue. The man of warre doth ſaye, yf I departe from the hooſte: the kynges maieſtie wyll be diſcontente wyth me. But vnto theſe a manne may ſaye, that yf he feare the kynge and vpon that occaſyon retournethe not home to his owne wyfe, he oughte ſoo to feare God, that he touche nor cōpany with none other mans, for as the kynge maye put hym to death▪ that returneth home from the hooſt to hys wyfe. without lycence, ſo maye god punyſhe hym perpetuallye, that beynge farre from hys wyfe, commytteth adulterye. I praye you good brethren, yf ſoo be that anye of you through your neceſſary

it is a dolorous and a lamentable thinge, that he (as I haue ſayde) who hathe victoriouſlye ouerthrowen ten of hys enemyes, ſhoulde be ouercome by a woman: or that he, which hath ouerthrowen ſo many of his enemies bodies, ſhould in hearte and ſoule be ouercome by a woman. Surelye it is to greuous a thing, that he whyche can not be ouercome with no weapon, ſhoulde be ſubdued through bodely luſt and pleaſure, or that ſwete and pleaſaunte wordes ſhoulde ouerturne hym, whome no hardnes could ouerturne, or that he which diſdayned to be the bondman of man, ſhoulde me rite to be the bondemanne of ſynne, when that it is a more

But this vnderſtāding dexely belouid brethrē, is to be corrected, for they that ſo flatter thē ſelfes, deceiue them ſelfes. For criminall ſynnes are not purgid by that trāſitorye fyre where of the Apoſtle dothe ſpeke, he ſhalbe ſafe him ſelfe, neuertheleſſe yet as it were thorow fire, but only ſmale & venyal ſinnes, althoug y• not only criminal, yt which thing

And yet ſome aſwell of the criminall as of the veniall, are to be reherſyd & ſpoken of leſte that any man ſhould vaniely go about to excuſe him ſelfe, and ſaye, that he knowethe not which are criminall and whiche are venial. And not withſtandynge the Apoſtle hath reherſed manye of the capitall and criminal ſinnes, yet leſt we ſhold be ſemed to cauſe deſperation, we ſhall truely & ſhortly declare and ſhewe you what they are.

And although ſmal & veniall ſynnes are knowē vnto all men, yet becauſe it were lōg to reherſe al, nedefull it is to name certen of them: As ofte as anye man in meate or drinke receueth more then nede is, he ſhall

And Math, 25 that theſe things the whyche we haue ſpokē of before may adhere & cleaue more ſurelye in your hartes, & that the apoſtolical leſſō may be more fully vnderſtāded, I ſhal repete them vnto your charities.

                     CHaſtitye and clene liuynge my moſt dere brethrē, doth holde and obtayne a glorious and an excellent place among other vertues: for it is ſhe alone that cauſeth ye clene mynds of men to ſee god, for the truth it ſelf doth ſay. Bleſſyd be the pure and clene of harte, for they ſhal ſe god. Althoughe Math, 5, he ſhulde ſay on the other ſyde. They truly ar miſers, & wretches, whoſe harts are polutyd with carnal concupyſcence, for they are drownyd in eternal paines. Chaſtite is a lyfe angely call▪ chaſtitie wyth humylytye ſhal meryte and deſerue the habytacyon of the holye Goſte, the

Oure members ſhould be dedicate & geuen vnto god, and not to fornication. Let man ſet the flames of eternal tormentes agaynſte the deſyres of hys fleſhe. Let a yong man vſe chaſtitie, that he maye be worthy and meryte the wyſedome of god. For wher is vnclennes of body, there is the habytation of the ſpyryt of yt deuyl, the whyche reioyſethe moſt in the inquination and fylthynes of our fleſhe. All vnclennes doth dyſpleſe god, but thoſe ſpecyallye, the which ar not natural & ther|

Yf thou graūt thy ſoule her cōcupiſcēces & luſts, it ſhall make thyne enemies to reioyce and laughe the to ſcorne. And Salomon y• moſt wiſeſt of al other, did ſpeake forth like ſentēces to beware of vnclenes of liuing, ſaieng.

them. Heare me therefore (o my ſonne) and depart not frō the words of my mouth, kepe thy way farre from her, and come not nyghe the dores of her houſe. Uerely Salomō ſaeth not theſe thinges onely of the vnclennes of harlottes, but alſo of all concupiſcences and luſtes of the fleſhe. But the reaſon of the mynd ſhuld forbyd the inuaſions & haſtyenes of the fleſh, and bridle the wicked voluptuouſnes there of. Furthermore he that before dyd forbyd the cohabitacion and dwellyng with women, doth ſay vnto yong mē, maye a man take fyre in hys boſome and hys clothes not be burnte. Or can one go vppon Proue, 6, whote coles and his fete not be hurte? euen ſo whoſoeeuer

goethe into hys neyghbours wife, and toucheth her can not be vngyltye. And in lyke maner, the blyſſed apoſtle doth monyſhe vs ſaying. It is good not to touch a woman, as thoughe there were 1, Cor, 7, euen by and by peryl & daunger in the touchynge of her, Chaſte purenes of yong men is fayre, and louid of god, and to al goodnes profitable, who ſo hath ſpiritual or carnal children, let him noryſhe & bringe them vppe to GOD in chaſtitie, and not to the deuyl, in fornicatiō. What doth it profit a man to haue chyldren, to nouryſhe thē and to loue them, yf he nouryſhe them to eternal torments. They that lyne in chaſtytye doo leade

But vnanimitie is in vs ſo diminiſhyd, that the libera litie of workes is clene brokē In thoſe daies they ſold their howſys, and laid vp their tre ſures in heuyn, and gaue the price of them to the apoſtles for to be dyſtrybutyd to the vſe of the poore. But now we geue nothynge of our patrymonye, nor yet oure tythes. And when god ddthe commaund vs to ſell, we bye rather and encreace.

Truelye it were a leſſe faute for hym that maketh a man drunken, to wound him and to cut hys fleſhe wyth a ſword, than to kyll and murder his ſoule with ſuperflutie of drynke.

But al ſuche whan they drowne other mē wyth drynke, do ſaye to the poore man aſking his almes, go henſe go, god ſhall ſende you. And truely, as longe as men walke, God wyll ſende them.

But whan we motion and make mentiō of theſe thinges, theſe bybbers & drunkardes paraduentute are angerye with all, and do murmur agaynſte vs, But althoughe there be whiche are moued, and angrye wythall, yet God wyllynge, there be that here and receaue this good counſell, & yt ſhal through gods mercye, be deliuered from thys horible & wycked ſynne of ebryetye.

For yf he ſhuld with drawe at once hys exceſſe of drinkīg, he euē with heuines whan he is moſt feruently athriſt, woulde crye out & ſaye

that he had rather be deade, thā to forſake his cuſtomable drinking, and drōkennes, nothing cōſidering, that it were farre more tollerable, that the body ſhuld die, than that the ſoule through ebrietie, and exceſſe of drinke ſhould peryſhe for euer. And therefore to auoide the ſufferaunce & paine of ſuch hete, and to be deliuered from ſuch tormētes, as he ſuffereth let hym (as I haue ſaid) daily diminiſh ſomwhat of that exceſſe & ſuperfluitye, vntil he become to a reaſonable wayes & cuſtome of drinkynge. For he that wyl (as I haue ſayd) diminyſhe and debate this thinge, ſhalbe delyuered of hys drōkennes, nor ſhall no more ſuffer ſuche intollerable payne. Now good

brethren I declaring and ſhe wyng you theſe thynges, doe quite & vnburden my ſelfe before God. And whoſoeuer he be that is inclyned to ye exces of drinke, & deſpiſeth to heare me, or yt at hys table will adiure & compell men to drinke, he ſhall at the daye of iudgement geue a rekenyng bothe for hym ſelfe and them. And becauſe there be certeine preiſtes (the, which ſhuld prohibit and forbydde ſuche thynges) that enforce and compel men to drinke more than nedeth, let them from henceforth begyn to correct and to amend themſelues, and ſoo to chaſtē other, that they, whan they ſhal appeare before god, ſuffer not for theyr owne drunkennes, and other menns to,

but that through their owne amendement, and the correction of other, they may merit to come to the eternal & euer laſtyng reward. And of this I do deſire you aboue al thinges, yea & adiure you by the feareful day of iudgement, yt ye as ofte as ye do bankette one another, auoyde and flye as poyſon that haynous and fylthy cuſtome, by the which ye other willingly, or againſt youre wylles are wonte to drinke by great meſure with out meſure.

But yet as farforthe as I do heare, my admonition hathe profited ſome of you but very ſlenderly & lytle. But yet if I ſhould not ſhew you theſe thinges, at y• day of iudgmēte I ſhuld geue but a ſlender & an heuye rekenyng, bothe for my ſelfe & you. But I excuſe & cleare my ſelfe before God, when yt oftentimes I do admonyſh & warne you that ye ſhuld not ſeke vpō theſe diuiners

Ye ſhall medie wt no inchaunters, for whoſoeuer Deut, 18 doth yt euyl, loſeth his chriſtianitie & becūmeth a pagane, and without he ſuccur & aide him ſelfe, wt almoſe dedes, & with hard & longe penaunce he ſhalbe loſt for euer. In like maner, looke that ye take no hede to witchcraft, And whē ye be in your iourney, regard not the ſyngynge and chatte rynge of byrdes, nor preſume not vpon theyr ſonges, to de nunce or ſhewe any deueliſhe inchauntment or ſorcery. Yt ſhal not obſerue nor marke vpon what daye ye go forthe of youre houſe, nor when yt ſhal returne home againe. For (as ſcrypture dothe ſaye)

God made al the dayes. The firſt day is made, & the ſecond and the thirde, lykewyſe the Gene, 1. fourth, the fifte, the ſixt, & the Sabboth. And god made al thynges verye good. Take hede alſo, that ye obſerue not thoſe ſacrilegius & folyſhe ne ſinges. But as oft as ye muſt nedes goo any where, bleſſe your ſelfe in y• name of chriſte Jeſus, & ſaying your cred, or els the lordes prayer wt good belefe, take your iornei, being well aſſured, y• god ſhal helpe & proſper you.

And aboue al thinges I woulde ye ſhoulde knowe, that Satan canne nother hurt you, none of youres, youre cattell, nor yet the leaſt part of your ſubſtaunce, but as farforth as he hath powre & lycence of god. Nor he durſte not deſtroye Jobs ſubſtaūce, nor yet once Job, 1, touche it. but that God dyd lycence & ſuffer him. And we reade, that when the euyl ſpirites & deuylles were expulſt Math 8, and caſt out of men, that they beſought Chriſt that he wold ſuffer them to enter into the heard of ſwyne. Yf the company of deuylls durſt not enter into the ſwyne without y• leue and ſufferaunce of God, who wyll be ſo vnfaithfull to beleue that they can or maye

hurte good Chriſtians, with oute his diſpenſation and ſufferaunce. God dothe ſuffer it for two diuers cauſes, other to proue whether we be good or els to amende vs, yf we be ſynnefull. But he that wyl pacientlye ſuffer gods dyſpenſation, and ſay whan he hath loſte anye thynge (as I haue Job, 1, tolde you) God gaue it, and god hath taken it, as it hath pleaſyd hym, ſoo it is, bleſſed be ye name of God. He for this his pacience moſt pleaſaunte and acceptable vnto the lord, ſhal receyue (yf he be a good man) the crowne of glory, or yf he be ſynfuil, indulgence & pardon of hys ſynnes. Take hede of thys good brethren, that whā Satan had deſtroied al Jobs ſubſtaūce, he ſaid

not god gaue it, and the dyuyll hath taken it. For the bleſſed man wuld not aſcribe ne geue no ſuche glorye nor power to Sathan, that he coulde take any thynge from man, that God ſuffered hym not to take. Conſyderynge than that Satan coulde not hurte Jobs chyldren, hys camels nor yet his aſſes, vntyll it pleaſed god to ſuffer hym▪ why do we chryſtians beleue that he may do any more vnto vs, then that the deuyne powre by his godly & ſecrete iudgement doeth ſuffer hym to doe? And therefore let vs ſurely beleue, that we cā loſe no more then god doeth ſuffer to be taken from vs. Let vs with al our heartes therfore go vnto his mercye, and

forſakinge theſe ſacrile gious obſeruations, let vs truſt cō
                     tinually vpon hys ayde and comfort, for he that beleueth in theſe foreſayde euylles, that is in diuinations, ſorſaries, philaters, or in anye other maner of wytchecrafte, notwithſtāding he falt, praye go continually to the church, geue large almoſe, & puniſhe his body with all affliction & payne, yet ſoo longe as he leuethe not theſe ſorceryes, it ſhall nothing auaile hym: for ſuche wicked and ſacrilegius obſeruations, do ouerrourne and deſtroye all theſe good & vertuous operations. Nor it can not auayle them, that with theſe euylles, doe that good is. For it is true that yt Apoſtle ſayeth, a lytle leuen 1, Cor, 5,

And he ſayth. No Math, 6, man can ſerue two mayſters Therfore if chriſten men doe loke thoroughe the grace of God to be ſaued, they muſte make no vowes to no trees, nor praye to no fountaynes, yf any man therefore haue in his feildes, in his houſe, or ny vnto his houſe, trees, alters, or anye other vayne thynge, where the poore wretched, & ſymple people are wonte to make theyr vowes, and doth not hewe them downe, and deſtroye them, he is and ſhall be partaker of al ſuch witchcraftes

and ſorcery as is and ſhalbe committed there. And what a thinge is thys, that whan anye ſuche tree, vnto y• which they were wonte and accuſtomed to do ſacrifice, do fall, that no man dare gether it, to make them fier wythal?

The Lord hath no neade, he doeth aſke no rewarde, but honoure on lye, nor he dothe not requyre, y• thou geue hym any thynge, that is thine.

For many waters ar much peple the thyrd portion of the hoſte, The thre portiōs whiche are made of chryſtes body vpon the alter, haue a miſtycal ſignyficatiō. The body of chriſt is the vniuerſall churche, y• is the hed with themēbers, and ther are found in this bodias it▪ were three partes, of the which the whole body doth confeſſe. 
 One part is y• head it ſelf. The heade is the heade, and lykewiſe apart of the bodye, therefore the heade it ſelfe is one parte of the bodye.
                  I ſaye the heade that nowe hath ryſyn immortal and impaſſyble, ſhal die nor ſuffer no Roma, 6 more. The other parte of the body is in theſe members the whych do now reſt in y• ſoule wyth the heade as it were in the ſabbote, poſſeſſynge one ſtole of immortalytye as concernyng the ſoules in heuen. Of the whych it is ſayd. The ſoules of ſayntes reioyce in heanen.

And therfore two partes are reſeruyd without the chalice vpon the aulter, as it were wythoute the paſſyon, For why goodmen nowe do fele Apo, 12, no doloure nor payne, for all theſe thynges are paſte.

infyrmitie ſhould abhore the eating of the fieſhe, and drinkyng of the bloud in the takyng therof, Chryſt would y• thoſe thynges ſhuld be coueryd & hyddē vnder the forms of brede & wyne, the whyche amōg al other fode of mākind Pſal, 10, are pryncipall & chefeſt. For certēly as cōcernyng y• letter breade, aboue al other foode doth ſtrēgthē the hert of mā, and wyne doth moſt cōforth the ſame: Therefore he purpoſyd & apointed his body and hys bloud ſo to be receuyd, y• in the one the ſenſes of man, ſhuld be nouryſhed, and that fayth in the other ſhoulde be edyfied. For why the ſenſys in the one, whilſt they behold wontly & cuſtomably things are noryſhed, & fayth in the other whilſt y• the fleſhly eye

doth out wardly ſee onthing & the, eye of the hart doth inwardly fele, & reuerēce a nother is edified. For one thing is hyddē & a nother apereth. Pſal, 17 For he made darkenes hys ſecret place. And as y• formes are ſene there, & the thynges and the ſubſtaūce of thē, not credydyd to be there, ſo the thyng is truely & ſubſtācially beleued, whoſe forme & ſhape is not ſene. The forme of bred and wine is ſene, and yet the ſubſtaunce of breade and wyne is not beleuyd. But the ſubſtaūce of the body and bloud (although the forme is not ſene) is beleuyd, and the forme of breade & wine, is ſet before vs to teach vs y• ther is a full and a perfecte refectyon. There is in the receit of y• body and bloud of chriſt a ful refection 
mete and drinke is brede and wyne. And being but one ſacrament, yet thre diuers thinges are ſet before vs, that is, a byſyble forme, the vnytye of the bodye, and the vertue of ſpiritual grace. The vyſyble forme is one thing, the which is ſene vyſibly, and the verite of the body which is beleuyd vnuyſyble, vnder a vyſyble forme is a nother, & the ſpyrytuall grace, the which is a viſybly and ſpiritually reeeyued, with the bopye & bloude onely of thoſe, that

of the fleſh, & the ſuperior charitie vnto the vertu of the ſpirituall grace. The litle mouſe doth at ſūtimes gnaw y• forme, & an

                      dog doth alſo receue it but y• only predeſtinate doth receue ye vertu of y• ſpiritual grace. That we doo ſe, is ye forme of bred & wyne. But y• that we beleue to be vnder ye forme of bred & wine is the very bodye, & the verye bloud, yt hung, & that ran out of hys ſide vpō ye croſſe. Therfore the ſacramētal, eating & receuyng, as cōcernyng the vyſyble forme and the verite of the body of chryſt is comenly cōuenient, both vnto the good and euil. But ther is (as I alredy haue ſaid) a nother eting of good mē only, y• which ye merit of life doth cauſe ye grace of god & faith working

That it may be vnto vs, the bodi and bloud of thi ſonne. It may be vnto vs, ſayeth he. No doute the body of our lord is alway made vpon the table of the alter, whan that ſolemne myſtery is duly celebratyd. But yet it is not alway made vnto thoſe, by whom it is made. Where vpon is that alſo in the canon. That as many as ſhal receaue of thys partycypatyō of y• alter, the ſacramēt of thy ſonne, may be replenyſhed with al beuēlye grace & benediction, For why al that receue the body of our lorde, by thys pertytypation of the

alter, ar not ſpiritualy repleniſhed with y• heuenly grace and benediction. Wherof is this, that we for that y• we do tēporally, may obtayne eternal ioye. And alſo. That we may obtaine the thinges wt an inuiſyble effect, whych we perceiue to be receyued with vyſible miſteries. And many other ſaiengs after this ſorte & maner. This ſacramēt therfore the which is repoſyd euē frō the beginning eternallye, hyddē from the deuyl, reuelid vnto the prophets, & cōmited to yourſolicitude, is to be folowyd wt dew thākes. O your holy and celeſtiall miſtery, O laudable deſyre, O noble ſpectakle, O ſolēne miraclc: God which in al things is wūderful is ſhewed as cōcernīg you more maruelous thā hun ſelf,

O ye preiſtes of God bleſſe ye the Lord, doinge the thynges that maye pleſe god, leſt that be to your raine, that is prouyded to the worthy receuer for helth and ſaluation, I ſhall not call your gods preiſtes, without a cauſe, yf in the houſe of god ye do liue preiſtly. For why yt dignitie cōmeth not in thys name becauſe he is a preiſt. I ſay not of ye name, but of vertue, of cōuerſation & not of ye office, of meritte, & not of the word, of holynes, & not of the miſtery. For ſcripture ſayeth we yt haue many preſtes, ſeke for preiſtly men, many I ſaye in number, & not in merit, in diſſimulatiō & not in fayth, in forme & not in vertue, in corral

cōmixtion, and not in ſpirytuall band, in the cōnuiction of the fleſhe, & not in ye vnitie of heart. Theyr handes be waſſhed, but theyr workes be vnwaſſhed. They come vnto the diuine ſacrifices with blody conciences. They eat without feare & reuerēce, the fleſhe of the Babe, the which ſitteth in heuen, as the fleſhe is ſolde in ye market. They do not aſſiſt & ſtād at ye alter as preſts, but as butchers in yt ſhābles. This degre certenly is a caſual degre, it is a iudicial degre thys anointid dignite, is not clarifide but by merits, by no bilife of maners, exercyſe of vertu, & by ye inſtaūce of good works.
