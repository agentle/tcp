                     The cauſe I know not, or I liſt not tell,
                     But ſo it often falles, and heere ſo fell.
                     
                        
None bolder then Pandorſus Syre, then he
                     None fearefuller; and yet he needs would be
                     A Souldier, where the Muſter-booke he fild,
                     But fought with none, nor ne're ſaw any kild.
                     
                        Artemon was more hardy though afraid
                     Of his owne ſhadow. Wagers haue beene laid,
                     That let an enemie fart, he would out-run
                     An Iriſhman, for feare t'had been a gun.
                     Where learned Spencer maketh harna'ſt Feare
                     
                     Afraid the claſhing of his armes to heare,
                     That apprehenſion he from hence did gaine,
                     Our Monſieur did, what Spencer did but faine.
                  
                  
                     But ſtay, I haue forgot to let you know
                     His education, and to ſhew you how
                     (Being nuſled vp in Letters) he in ſport
                     His time wore out at Schoole and Innes of Court,
                     
                     Yet ſo as once a Gipſie, who did looke
                     Vpon his Palme, ſaid he, ſhould liue by's booke;
                     Which fortune ſome conceiue hath doubtfull ſcope,
                     As if his booke ſhould ſaue him from the rope:
                     But ſince he proues, it meant another thing,
                     That teaching Tongues, he ſhould liue like a King;
                     And ſo he now doth, liuing as he luſt,
                     And by his owne will meaſuring what is iuſt.
                     For being ſet to Schoole when he was young,
                     He of all knowledge learn'd both taile and tongue.
                     
                        Th' Italian, Latin, Spaniſh and the French,
                     He grew as cunning in, as at a Wench.
                     
                     A Dictionary of all words of Art,
                     And Lullies old-ends, he hath got by heart.
                     Th' apparrell of all knowledge he doth weare,
                     And 'bout him (Bias-like) his wealth doth beare.
                     
                        
And now (growne ripe) he doth religion chooſe
                     That's moſt in faſhion, as our great ones vſe:
                     But otherwiſe for truth hee'le neuer burne,
                     Th' aduantage of his wry-necke helps him turne:
                     He knowes the way, and wills the world ne're doubt,
                     That comming raw in, hee'le go roſted out.
                  
                  
                     In youth he tooke to Wife a louely Dame,
                     
                     Not hight the chaſt Penelope by name;
                     But worthy ſuch an attribute, for ſhee
                     Her wandring looſe Vliſſes did not ſee
                     In twenty yeeres, and yet t'is thought her bed
                     Shee kept vnſtain'd, and vn-ad-horn'd his head.
                     But what a bleſsing was, he thought a curſe,
                     His wife had better beene, had ſhee been worſe,
                     Her goodneſſe made him hate her; ſhe had dide
                     But that a dozen muſt be kil'd beſide.
                     He knew not then (as I haue heard him ſay)
                     Th' Italian tricke, but the plaine Engliſh way,
                     Of ſimple Country poyſoning, now he knowes
                     To do t by inches; Court perfection growes.
                     
                        Lopus and Squire, are not ſo skil'd as hee,
                     And ſcarce Romes Conclaue in that myſterie.
                     He can a Nullitie worke, diuorce the life
                     Twixt ſoule and body, ſooner then ſome wife.
                     And if his ricke be knowne, men ne're will ſeeke
                     A doubtfull way by law, but do the like.
                  
                  
                     His wife thus ſcap'd a ſcouring, ſo did he,
                     When being merry once in company
                     And paſsing Smith-field (then vnpau'd) too late
                     With rich Canary hauing linde his pate,
                     The owle-eyde Sharkers ſpi'd him, how he felt
                     To finde a poſt; his meaning ſoone they ſmelt:
                     
                        
And then the ſturdieſt knaue, with ſodain'd ruſh,
                     Our wauering Monſieur on his knees did puſh,
                     The whil'ſt another kindly to him ſpoke;
                     Help't him out of the durt, and chang'd his cloke.
                     This cloke he wore next day, and paſsing by
                     A Brokers ſhop, the prentice lowde gan cry
                     Sirs ſtop the theefe, the cloake this fellow weares
                     Is mine: with that they ſwarm'd about his eares,
                     Conuayde him to a Iuſtice, where one ſwore
                     He had been branded ſtagmaticke before.
                     Another ſaid, he was the man that hung
                     Three dayes beyond Seas, as the ballad ſang;
                     The cauſe why he his necke awry, did hold,
                     Was for he hang'd long, and was ta'ne downe cold
                     But to the Iuſtice being throughly knowne,
                     For carrying letters where't muſt not be ſhowne,
                     And for his skill, each moderne language ſpeaking,
                     And wondrous Art, to ſilence doores from ſqueaking,
                     With loſſe of his good cloke, he ſlipt the hooke,
                     And thus he once was ſaued by his booke.
                  
                  
                     Thus farre I ſtretch my lines, thus farre he liues,
                     And more I'le write, when he direction giues.
                     But if I die, theſe lines ſhall be the glaſſe

                     The Parrot fit, and ſome the nimble Ounce;

                     I doe ſurpaſſe the beaſts in hauing wings,
                     The birds in legs, in taile, and other things:
                     My force doth match the Lyons, and my heart
                     The Eagle, or excels them in each part.
                     Your doome I therefore claime, that I may be

                        Who ſeeks two callings, takes too much in hand:
                        Who hath two faiths, doth true to neither ſtand.
                        One ſword, one office

                           calling, and one faith,
                        Is fit for one Man; ſo this ſtorie ſaith.
                     
                     
                        
                        Who ſeekes two ſwords to ſway, hath right to none.
                        The Pope challengeth not onely Peters keyes and Pauls ſword, but hath found two ſwords in Peters hand, with which he (like another Alexander) cuts aſunder the knots hee cannot vndoe. The band of marriage betwixt man and woman: The hand of loyall obedience betwixt ſubiects and Soueraignes; The band of conſcience betwixt God and man; hee cuts aſunder by diſpenſing with marriages, allegeance, and others, &c. By his behauiour therefore in theſe things, it may bee iudged whether hee be fit to haue many ſwords that cannot vſe one well. Edged tooles are not to bee put into the hands of drunkards: Hee is ſcarce ſober that makes all other drunke with the c

                        Who ſeekes two Callings, takes too much in hand.

                     To ruine man was his whole trade and ſtudy.
                     He ſcorn'd the ſheep, the ſhepheard was his prey,
                     His nightly plots got, what he miſt by day.
                     The ſhepheards of Arcadia, beguil'd
                     By his fain'd voice, were murther'd oft and ſpoil'd.
                     For in the night he wont like ſome good friend,
                     To call them out, and then a peeces rend.
                     One onely wiſer ſhepheard thought it beſt
                     Hire Sphinx to watch his houſe whil'ſt he did reſt:
                     
                        
Whoſe ſubtiltie foreſaw, and ſtill preuented,
                     What elſe his Maſter had too late repented.
                     For when the falſe Hyena went about
                     Calling for helpe, to train
                           •
                         the Shepheard out,
                     Faining diſtreſſe as if he robbed were,
                     Or miſt his way (a weary traueller);
                     
                        Sphinx ſoone perceiu'd his counterfeit complayning,
                     And laught out-right to heare his craftie fayning;
                     But would not let the credulous ſhepheard goe,
                     (Whoſe tender heart pittied his mortall foe)
                     Till day appear'd, and that the Sunne ſhone bright.

                     Nor did they alwaies ſleep but often heard
                     What at the firſt to thinke vpon they fear'd;

                        t all awe,
                     And they afrayd were when they nothing ſaw.
                     So enuy wrought, and Ignorance, and Pride,
                     That they the wiſer Sphinx dare now deride.
                     And mou'd the Shepheard, to preuent the charge
                     Of keeping more, to let the Sphinx at large.
                     Perſwading there was no ſuch cauſe of dread,
                     But they might well ſupply the Sphinx his ſtead:
                     Who fain'd thoſe feares, and did imagine treaſon,
                     To win th' opinion of much wit and reaſon.
                     The Sheapheard fondly credits this; and ſtraight

The night is come, the Shepheard ſoundly ſleeps

                     Her taile was too too large for him to tread,
                     He too too little her to ouer-ſpread.
                     To ouerſpread her body was not much,

                     She lou'd all great things, and all rare things ſought,
                     But what ſhe had that ſhe eſteemed nought.
                     She had what others long'd for, and enioyde
                     What all deſir'd: and that enioying cloyde.

                     Although the Phaenix her with teares did woo,
                     She ſeparation ſought, and gets it too.

                     That ſhe reſolues what'euer power ſaith no,
                     Example and direction hence to take,

                     And thus gan ſpeake to them with rauiſht tounge.
                     How much my power hath done, how much my wit,
                     You know, yet know ſome repetition fit.
                     I do the Eagle rule, (the birds braue King)
                     And worke him to my minde in euery thing.
                     He preyes on whom I liſt; ſtill on the beſt;
                     Eates what I ſtint him, and leaues you the reſt.
                     I gouerne euery Hawke, or bird of prey;
                     Such as confront the Eagle, me obay;
                     And make me ſharer in their richeſt prize,
                     And how to pleaſe me beſt, beſt meanes deuiſe.

To both for my aduantage, elſe you know
                     I can prophane the Temple well enough;
                     Pollute the Altar; ſearch the graue, each tombe,
                     And dig out of the priuiledged wombe
                     Of hallow'd earth, dainties for you to lurch,

                     All ſorts, profeſsions, kinds, I prey vpon,
                     When their ſweete ſleſh is turn'd to carrion.
                     For carrion is my food, let others kill

                     A ſword and dagger, or ſome ſuch like toole,
                     To help the true man, and the theefe to coole.
                     The Merchant mus'de (as well he might) at this,
                     And thought within himſelfe; this fellow is
                     Moſt fit for my imployment, I will ſtraight
                     Hire him to be my Bailiefe. No deceit

                     This to the Oſtrich motion'd, he agrees,
                     The wages are ſet downe, the vailes, the fees,
                     The liuory, with circumſtance enough,
                     And they come home

                     The Oſtrich carefully laies vp the rakes,
                     The pitch-forke teines, the yron-pointed ſtakes,
                     The wedges, hammer, hatchet, and the nailes,

                     The ſhare, the coulter, heele-yorne, and the cocke,
                     The whip, the horſe

                         ſhooe, with the key and locke.
                     He needs no locke and key to keepe them vnder,
                     But keeps both lock & key, where you wold wonder.
                     Then comes into the houſe, puts vp the gun,
                     The ſword and dagger; and when this is done,
                     Deuoures the dripping-pan, the cob-irons, ſpit,
                     And ſwallowes all the iron bit by bit.
                     
                        
The Merchant praiſ'd his fortune, that he had
                     Got one ſo good, 'mongſt many ſeruants bad.
                     Told him he ſhortly would his ſtate preferre,
                     From being Bailiffe, to be Treaſurer;
                     For he could not inuent a ſurer hold,
                     Then th' Oſtrich had for ſiluer, or for gold.
                  
                  
                     And now the Merchant leauing one at home,
                     That he may well truſt, goes abroad to rome:
                     Neglects his houſe and lands, thinkes all is well,
                     And as he wont to doe, doth buy and ſell.
                     Mongſt other things he ſold, becauſe the warres
                     Began afreſh, he truct for yron barres.
                     For he was one of thoſe that would for gaine:
                     Sell bullets, where they were ſhot home againe,
                     And did our Mines and Woods on Ordnance waſt,
                     Which ſpite of lawes, he to the Enemie paſt,
                     Much yrone he had at home, and ſold beſide
                     All kinde of armour fit for ſuch a tide.
                     So home he comes glad of ſo good a mart,
                     For here he knowes the Oſtrich playes the part
                     Of a good Bailiffe. He may eaſily thriue,
                     When ſuch a full winde doth his fortune driue.
                     His land he finds vntill'd, he wonders then
                     And thinkes the fault reſts on his lazy Men.
                     They ſay they wanted yrons for the plough,
                     He wonders, for the Bailiffe had enough.
                     He findes his houſe all naked, not a bit
                     Of meate prepar'd, the Cooke wants pot, and ſpit
                           •
                        
                     
                     He goes to bed, the theeues aſſault his houſe:
                     He hath no weapon to reſiſt a Mouſe.

His barres are gone, his houſhold-ſtuffe, and all,
                     Now to account his Bayliffe he doth call.

                     And gaue them worke, but gaue them not to eate.
                     How he neere hand had made a monſtrous neaſt,
                     Where whilſt they faſted, he and his did feaſt.
                     And thither he conuaide the yron worke
                     Where the ſhe Oſtrich and his young did lurke;
                     Who ſwallow'd all: for they haue mawes as large
                     As culuerings, which would as ſoone diſcharge
                     The yron loade; and ſooner farre would ſpend,
                     And bring a world of wealth to lauiſh end.
                  
                  
                     The Oſtrich to excuſe himſelfe bewraies
                     The place where ſafely he this yron layes.

                     He dung'd, when he his maw did ouer-fill.

                     Long was it ere they could be heard, for ſtill,
                     The Cormorant, (for ſo we call him will)
                     Had many friends in euery Court, which he
                     Maintainde with large ſhares, and full liberall fee.
                     For ſtill his gorge full laden, ready ſtood,
                     And when they miſt elſe-where they here had food:
                     Food of each kinde, for euery ſtomacke fit,
                     And ſuch as fauorites were, had part of it.
                     Long thus he put them off, yet at the laſt,

                     O noble Lyon, quoth the Cormorant,
                     
                     I am a fiſh, the water ſtill I hant.
                     And here I take my food, and lead my life,
                     Free from oppreſsion, and each cauſe of ſtrife.
                     Why, quoth the Lyon, now I heard thee bray
                     Like to an Aſſe. True, True, my Lord ye ſay,
                     (Quoth this ſmooth hypocrite) for I would faine
                     Be like an Aſſe, ſo innocent and plaine.
                     I loue beaſts well, and next your excellence,
                     The humble Aſſe, for ſtill his patience.
                     And now to put your highneſſe out of doubt,
                     Behold me ſwimme and diue, (ſo launcht he out
                     Far from the Lyons reach) If beaſts quoth he,

                     Of all that in that wealthy Rode did trade?
                     O mighty Emperour (aloud he cri'de)
                     I hardly ſcap't euen now his curſed pride
                     For being by my noble Maſter ſent,

                     Quoth then the Whale, I ſearch to meete that ſlaue.
                     But what art thou that canſt ſo well behaue,
                     Thy tayle and nimble fins? Art not a fiſh?
                     That I were ſuch (quoth he) it is my wiſh.
                     I like thy milder reigne where ſubiects ſay,
                     For loue, and not for dread, they thee obey.
                     And would arm'd in white ſcales, if I might chooſe
                     Serue thee a fiſh, and my blacke feathers looſe.
                     But Nature this forbids; yet ſtill I ſtriue,

                     I haue performde whatſere I wrote or ſpoke.

For without this his kingdome would decay,

                     T'attempt great Ladies and to purchace loue.
                     I purcha'ſt loue ſo long, till all I had,

                     To haue your names found here, it is repented

                     Naked of honour, if you be of worth:
                     But whilſt you be what now I know and write,
                     Your fames guard me, and I giue you your right;
                     Yet not in place, for I my ſelfe profeſſe

                  MONARCHIA.
                  DEDICATED To all the worthy profeſſors of the Law, who make not priuate-wealth, but the good and peace of the Commonwealth the end of their ſtudies and practiſe.
                  
                     Though you (perhaps) be Clyentleſſe and few,
                     Friendleſſe and poore, yet 'tis to you I ſue
                     For kinde acceptance. You alone are they
                     Who by example guide vs in our way.
                     You looke not on the fee, but on the cauſe, 
                           Cambden Inſula vectis. This title is giuen them by our worthy L. chiefe Iuſtice of Eng.
                     
                     And follow truth, as truth doth lead the Lawes.
                     The reſt, with vice, and wealths ill-gotten load,
                     Paſſe on to death, in glories beaten road.
                  
                  
                     TH' inhabitants of the Ile of Wight did boſt,
                     No vermin vs'd to harbour in their coaſt.
                     For they no hooded Monkes, nor Foxes had,
                     Nor Law * Retriuers who make fooles run mad,
                     
                        
With their ſtrife-ſtirring tongues; but liu'd as free,
                     From theſe, as by them others combred be.
                  
                  
                     And though our whole land cannot boaſt ſo farre,
                     That we from all ſuch vermin quitted are:
                     Yet happy is our Ile, that's hemd about
                     With water-walles, to keepe our enemies out;
                     Whilſt we (as Adam did) in Eden dwell,
                     And ſcarce of famine in an age heare tell.
                     Where hils are clad with woods, and vales with corn
                     Whoſe laden eares doe liſten to be ſhorne.
                     Where ſhephearde neither Lyon doubt, nor Beare,
                     Nor rauening Wolfe which ſheep & ſhepheard teare;
                     But each in ſafety dwell, and ſillie ſheepe
                     From all but Man, doe one the other keepe.
                  
                  
                     O happy are we if we know our good,
                     And if our ſtate be rightly vnderſtood:
                     To liue thus free vnder ſo bleſt a King,
                     Iuſt Magiſtrates and Cleargy-men, that ſing,
                     The ſongs of Syon in the holy tongue
                     Conuerting old men, and informing yong.
                     
                        No ſpirit-tyrant, Pope, State, Tyrant, Turke.
                     Can here their bloudy ends and proiects worke;
                     But each in ſafety may his owne poſſeſſe,
                     More free then Kings, becauſe our cares be leſſe.
                  
                  
                     But moſt vnhappy are thoſe neighbour lands,
                     Where Peace, and Plenty, as two ſtrangers ſtands;
                     Where bloodie war, and bloodleſſe famine ride
                     Vpon the ruin'd top of thankleſſe Pride:
                     Where Law deſtroies, Diuinity deceiues,
                     And where the crowne the care of kingdome leaues.
                     Where men eate men, as beaſt deuourd by beaſt,
                     The ſtrong the weaker kill, the great the leaſt.
                     
                        
Where tyrannie in triumph mounted hie,
                     Makes truth and innocence in dungeon lie.
                  
                  
                     This tale the difference ſhewes, that weemay know
                     How much to God for our good king we owe.

                     Hauing as Admirall the Nauy led
                     From Syria through the Seas, to Cyprus ſhore,
                     Where all the Ile with greene is couered o're.

                     To free himſelfe from thence, to larger ill.
                     Good brother (quoth the ſtranger) let me know,
                     What heauy thoughts they are that vex you ſo?
                     Why do you ſadly ſo your ſelfe bemone?
                     Why hauing friends within come you alone
                     To feed ſad melancholly, and inuent
                     To doe a raſh act, which youle ſoone repent?

                     All meanes to free my ſelfe, from being thus

                     They both with eager appetite accept

                     The Bull doth bellow, deepe, and lowde and high.
                     The earth doth tremble, and the ayre doth ſhun,
                     This dreadfull thunder; as when laden gun
                     Spits forth its load, in ſcorne to be reſtraind,
                     The ayre giues way vnto the bullets chaind,
                     As dreading to reſiſt ſo mighty force,
                     Thus meet the valiant Bull, the Hart and Horſe.
                  
                  
                     The Hart and Horſe firſt touch tha'ppointed place
                     Being more ſwift, and apter for the race.

                     But ere a ſecond bout they can performe,
                     In comes the boyſtrous Bull, like winters ſtorme,
                     
                        
And ſeuers them with ſuch a violent puſh,
                     That they amazde, turne giddy with the ruſh.
                     But (nimble both and actiue they repay
                     The ſturdie Bull, with all the ſpeed they may.
                     The Hart with his broadhornes, doth make him reel

                     But the kinde Horſe, vpholds him with his heele.
                     The Bull thanks neither, for the one did pearce
                     His hollow flanke, the other much more fearce,
                     Did breake a rib, and bruiſe his ſhoulder blade,
                     And taught him with leſſe choller to inuade.
                     Yet th'ods is ſoone recouer'd with his horne,
                     Which hath the belly of the Courſer torne.
                     And rent one weaker beame, from branched Hart,
                     As trees by thunder riuen, or clouen athwart.
                     The ſubtle Hart, then ſhuns thoſe ruder blowes,

                     The Horſe taught by his wounds, doth keepe aloofe,
                     And ſtands vpon defence, with hardned hoofe.
                     The Bull aſſaults them both with watchfull eye,
                     And ſeeks how he aduantages may ſpie.
                     The Horſe and Hart vpon their guard do ſtand,
                     In doubt and iealouſie, on either hand.
                     The Bull aſſaults the Hart, but he giues way,
                     And ſlips his furie with what ſlight he may.
                     Yet turnes not head, as fearefull cowards will,
                     But wefes aſide, to tyre his foe with skill.
                     The Bull then ſtrikes the Horſe a deadly cuff,
                     But he requites him with a counterbuff.
                     The Hart ſtrikes in betwixt, the Bull turnes rownd,
                     The Horſe leaps right vp, doth coruet, and bownd;

                     Breakes the Harts necke, this is the end of all

                     Their deaths not doubted, long they there remaine,
                     Till that the King their Maſter, hauing neede

                     So enters he the place, and there he ſpies
                     What doth affright him, all his comfort lies
