            To the tune of Dulcina.
            
               
                  
               
               
                  FRom Oberon in Fairy Land
                  the King of Ghosts and shadowes there,
                  Mad Robbin I at his command,
                  am sent to view the night-sports here.
                  What reuell rout
                  Is kept about
                  In euery corner where I goe,
                  I will ore see.
                  And mery be,
                  And make good sport with ho ho ho.
               
               
                  More swift then lightning can I flye,
                  and round about this ayrie welkin soone,
                  And in a minutes space descry
                  each thing that's done beneath the Moone:
                  There's not a Hag
                  Nor Ghost shall wag.
                  Nor cry Goblin where I do goe,
                  But Robin I
                  Their seats will spye
                  And 
                        〈◊〉
                      them home with ho ho ho.
               
               
                  If any wanderers I méet
                  That from their night sports doe trudge home
                  With counterfeiting voyce I gréet,
                  and cause them on with me to roame
                  Through woods▪ through lakes,
                  Through bogs, through brakes
                  Ore bush and brier with them I goe,
                  I call vpon
                  Them to come on,
                  And wend me laughing ho ho ho.
               
               
                  Sometimes I méet them like a man,
                  sometimes an oxe, sometimes a hound,
                  And to a horse I turne me can,
                  to trip and trot about them round.
                  But if to ride
                  My backe they stride,
                  More swift then winde away I goe,
                  Ore hedge and lands,
                  Through pooles and ponds,
                  I whirry laughing ho ho ho.
               
               
                  When Ladds and Lasses merry be,
                  With possets and with iunkets fine,
                  Unséene of all the Company,
                  I eate their cates and sip their wine:
                  and to make sport,
                  I fart and snort,
                  And out the candles I doe blow,
                  The maids I kisse,
                  They shrieke who's this
                  I answer nought but ho ho ho.
               
               
                  Yet now and then the maids to please,
                  A card at midnight up their wooll;
                  And while they sleep, snort, fart, and 
                        〈◊〉
                     ,
                  with whéele to threds their hare I pull:
                  I grind at Mill
                  Their Malt vp still,
                  I dresse their hemp, I spin their towe
                  If any wake,
                  And would me take,
                  I wend me laughing ho ho ho.
               
            
            
               
               The second part, To the same tune.
               
                  
               
               
                  VVHen house or harth doth sluttish lie,
                  I pinch the Maids there blacke & blew,
                  And from the bed the bed-cloathes I
                  pull off, and lay them naked to view:
                  twixt sléepe, and wake
                  I doe them take
                  And on the key cold floore them throw,
                  If out they cry
                  Then forth flye I,
                  And loudly laugh I ho ho ho.
               
               
                  When any néed to borrow ought,
                  we lend them what they doe require.
                  And for the vse demaund we nought,
                  our owne is all we doe desire:
                  If to repay
                  They doe delay
                  Abroad amongst them then I goe,
                  And night by night
                  I them affright
                  With pinching, dreames, and ho ho ho.
               
               
                  When lazie queanes haue naught to doe,
                  but studybate and mischiefe too
                  twixt one another secretly:
                  I marke their glose
                  And doe disclose
                  To them that they had wronged so,
                  When I haue done
                  I get me gone
                  And leaue them scolding ho ho ho.
               
               
                  When men doe traps and engins set
                  in loope-holes where the vermine créepe,
                  That from their foulds and houses set
                  their ducks and géese, their lambs and shéepe,
                  I spy the gin
                  And enter in,
                  And seemes a vermin taken so
                  But when they there
                  approach me neare
                  I leape out laughing ho ho ho.
               
               
                  By Wels and Gils in medowes gréene
                  we nightly dance our heyday guise,
                  And to our fairy king and quéene
                  wée chant our moone-light harmonies
                  When larkes gin sing
                  Away we fling.
                  And babes new borne steale as we goe,
                  An elfe in bed
                  We leaue in stead,
                  And wend us laughing ho ho ho.
               
               
                  From Hag-bred Merlins time haue I
                  thus nightly reueld to and fro:
                  And for my pranks men call me by
                  the name of Robin Good-fellow:
                  
                  Fiends, ghosts, and sprites
                  That haunt the nights,
                  The Hags and Goblins doe me know,
                  And Beldams old
                  My feats haue told,
                  So Vale. Vale, ho ho ho.
               
            
            FINIS.
