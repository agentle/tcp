            In the .iiij. chaptre is heauen made open and the secretes therof manyfested vnto the christen beleuer / whom Iohan also representeth thys whole boke ouer.

            In the .v.vi. and .vij. chaptres / the lambe Christ openeth the .vij. seales of the boke of the most hydden mysteryes of God / for the .vij. ages of the christē churche. In the me

            In the .viij. and .ix. chaptres / the .vij. angels blowe their trompettes. Sygnyfyenge the preachers to shewe forth their massages appoynted of God for the .vij. ages of the churche / manye wonderfull plages folowynge in the peple for theyr vnbeleues sake / they obstinatlye resistinge yt or els vnthākefully receyuinge it.
            
               In the .x. chaptre cometh the myghtye Angell from heauen with a boke in hys hande all open / and Iohan deuowreth the same. Which betokeneth the ernest preachers of this lattre age of the churche / wherin the true seruauntes of God shall gredelye receyue and also dygest the scripturs. Take this for a brefe summe of all that is spoken in the other volume / the resydue shall folowe here after in course.
            In the mergende of that first part or volume / put I manye allegacyons both of the scripturs and doctors. And there vnto was I first prouoked by this saynge of Saynt Hierome in a serten Epystle of his ad paulinum monachum. The Apocalyps of saynt Iohā (sayth he) hath so manye mysteries as it hath wordes / or for euerye worde a mysterye whether ye wyll.
            I mynded also therby / my labours to ease the readers for serche of the places / ād to sygnyfye vnto them that I ded nothynge therin without autoryte. And vndoubtedlye the gatherynge of those places was so laboryouse vnto me / as the makynge of the commentarye / whych neuerthelesse I thought wele bestowed for the confort of my bretherne.
            But .ij. cruell enemyes haue my iust labours had in that behalfe / of whom

the one haue thē falsifyed / the other blasphemed. Which hath caused me to leaue them out in all that here foloweth. The printers are the first / whose headye hast / neglygence / and couetousnesse commonly corrupteth all bokes. These haue both dysplaced them and also changed their nōbers to the truthes derogacyō / what though they had at theyr handes .i
                  •
               . lerned correctours which toke all paynes possible to preserue them.
            The other is Momus or Zoilus / yea / rather one which playeth both partes vndre the clocke of a christyane. Thys cruell carper and malycyouse quareller leaueth no mannes worke vnrebuked / mynistre it neuer so moche godlynesse. But lyke as rust / mothes / maggottes / cā
               kers / caterpyllers / with other vyle vermyne corrupteth all that is to the vse of man / so doth this enemye / to destroye both name and worke / onlye for the auauncemēt of his owne preciouse persone.
            His workinge toles are soche vnsauerye sophysmes / problemes / clenches / corolaryes / quydditees / subtiltees / seconde intēcyons / intrinsecall moodes / with other prodigiouse sorceryes / whom he sumtyme sucked out of his mothers brestes the vnyuersyte. These hath he not yet all / as vnsauerye morsels euometed for Christ / distyninge rather with Aristotle

than with paule in his daylye disputacions.
            Of this ryall Rabiys peter iudged a fole / and Iohan an vnlerned Idiote. Yet shall his reader fynde small lerninge at his hande / vnlesse he take an heape of barbarouse termes and vnsowed togyther sentences for matters of excellent lernynge. But surelye Iohan will one daye come from Ephesus to visyte this proude Diotrephes & shewe hym of his arrogant bragges to his displeasure / vnlesse he leaue of in tyme. All Aristotles prouision shall not helpe hym.
            Sathan vpon the pynnacle of the temple neuer bestowed his alleged scripture more peruerselye / than thys Momus interpreted serten of my allegacyōs / nor yet farther from their right vnderstandynge▪ But I forgeue it him with thys fore warnynge for this tyme / though it be not the first lewde poynt that he hath played / in case he so leaue his quarellynge. My secōde allegacyō vpon the preface .i. Corin. vi. is not sett there to auctoryse the Apocalyps / as he most falsely and all contrarye to my meanynge hath interpreted i

knowe that the Epistle vnto the Corinthyanes was written of Paule .x. years at the least before Saynt Iohans Apocalyps. No lesse is he thā a false prophete that resisteth Ieremy rebukynge Babylon for her wyckednesse.
            To moche it were to answere hys other quarellynges / and to tedyouse vnto the christen readers / and therfor I passe them ouer / least I shuld be to plentuouse in answeringe a fole accordinge to his folyshnesse. Thus by these cruell hā
               delinges of these .ij. vngracyouse enemyes / haue I iust occasyon to leaue out the allegacyons in the margende / obseruynge this wh

For the one of hys churlyshe nature teareth and deuoureth / the other lyke a swyne treadeth it vndre his fylthye feate.

               The .xi. Chaptre.
               UNto Iohan was delyuered after that he had thus deuowred the boke / a rede / not vnlyke to the metewande of .vi. cubites longe and a spāne / whych was geuen vnto Ezechiel / nor verye farre different from the measurynge lyne in Zacharie. And what ys this els? but that the administracion of Gods heauēlye verite is secretlye of him committed vnto them whych hath afore receyued yt / and in faithe digested it / that they shuld ther with ryghtlye measure / discerne / ād iudge all thinges. Nō other is yt to prophecye ageyne in this sixt age / but thus to mete the temple / the aulter / and the worshippers therin / and to proue them in length / bredeth / heyth / and depeth.
               
                  ¶ The text. 1
                  
                     
                     
                  
                  
                     ANd than was geuen me a reede. 2. lyke vnto a rodde. 3. and yt was sayd vnto me. Aryse. 4. and meete the temple of God. 5. and the aulter. 6. and them that worshippe therin. 7. And the quere / which is within the temple / cast out. 8. & meete it not. 9. for it is geuē vnto the gētiles. 10: And the holye cyte shal they treade vndre fote xlij. monethes
                  
                     1 And there was geuen me (sayth saynt Iohan) a rede. Both receyued I the wysdome of God and also a mouthe to vtter yt. So that my tonge became the penne of a redye writer. For so moche as I abhorred iniquite / the lord anoynted me in wardlye with the oyle of gladnesse / and gaue me stomake to vtter hys worde.
                  2 The rede which God delyuered me / was lyke vnto a rodde. For hys worde ys the rodde of right order / And the scepture of hys kingedome. With this rodde spredde he oute the heauens / and layde forth the fyrst foūdacyon of the earthe. This rodde of his power hath the lorde now graciouslye sent us out of Syon by menne hauinge his speciall grace as by Iohan / 
                        •
                     o haue dominyō here in the middest of his enemies.
                  3 For vnto Iohan yt was sayd for this age. Aryse / frō vayne stodye / from cares of the bodye / from consideracion of earthlye causes.
                  4 And mete the holye temple of God / which is his congregacion or churche: Proue all beleues whether they be right or no. Examyne their workes / whether they springe of Gods commaūdemēts or of mennes tradicions. And in so doynge trye by the scripturs the 
                        •
                     orne from the chaffe Marke out the peple of God from the synagoge of sathan / and delaye not

to norryshe them with the swete frutes of the sprete.
                  5 Measure the aulter also / which is Iesus Christ / vpō whō the full sacrefice of redemptyon was offred. For manye false cristes are a brode in the worlde / to seduce the peple. The pope boasteth hym self for gods owne vicar / Mahomete calleth him self the grete prophete of the lorde. And both they to subdewe the gospell hath sett vp newe lawes. The pope hys detestable decrees / and Mahomete his abhominable alchorane. Both thei haue wrought soche wōders and soche signes in superstycion / as myght deduce into erroure (yf God were not mercyfull) the verie elect persons. The mōkes sayth that Christ ys in the desert / the prestes sayth he is in the boxe / but admonishe my peple / that in no case they beleue yt. The chanons sayth he is here / the fryres sayth he is there / but coūsell my flocke that they go not forth. For God dwelleth in nothinge that is made with hāde. In the faythfull hart is Christ onlye foū
                     de. There remaineth he. That is his dwellynge place.
                  6 Therfor now last of all / measure them also that worshipp in the temple. Considre them onlye to be his peple / which seke hym in sprete and in veryte / and that worship not in outwarde shaddowes / 

nor in the elementes of this worlde / nor yet with obseruacyō of dayes & tymes. They are not his sonnes / that for the 
                        •
                     euen of the Pharisees which ys the doctrine of hypocrites / forsaketh the bread of children which is his lyuinge worde. They are not his lābes but vyle gottes / that rather attēdeth to the voyce of straū
                     gers / thā to the trewe sheparde Christ.
                  7 And therfor the quere which ys wythin the tēple / cast out. The prelates / prestes / and religiouse / which are not of the common sort / seclude from Christ / from his churche / and from the companye of true worshippers. Throwe forth the bonde woman ād her sonne / the Rome churche with her children / and Mahomete with hys rable. For the bonde shall not inherete with the fre.
                  8 Measure not out that chaunsell of charmers / that college of Galaās bretherne / those marked Madianytes and cursed Ismaelytes. Allowe them not by the scripturs / cōmende not theyr coūterfet ryghtousnesse. Admyt thē not for the mēbres of Christ / but iudge them to be the sinagoge of Sathā. And speare thē out of the kingedome of God / with the keye of Dauid. For they are those swine that tread perles vnder their fete & those cruell dogges that turne agayne to deuowre mē
                     ne. Medle not with that quere / haue not

to do with that wycked generacion.
                  9 For it is geuē vnto the gētiles. Whollie are those Antichristes addict to the supersticiouse rytes of the heythē in their sacrifices / their ceremonies / their obseruatiōs / their holy dayes / theyr vygils / fastinges 
                        •
                      praynges / knelinges / & all other vsages / cōtrary to the admonyshement of Christ. That they shuld in no wyse entre into the wayes of the gētiles. Wherfor God hath detested thē with his owne mouthe / & cleane geuē thē ouer vnto theyr owne fylthye lustes. Now reygne they al in their owne wisdome / thinkynge euermore their owne fleshlye fantasies best: wholly they are become Gētiles.
                  10▪ And the holye cyte (of whom gloryouse thynges are spoken) they shall treade vndre fote the space of .xlij. monethes. Not the earthlye Hierusalem ys thys cyte / buylded of menne / and made holye by the out warde obseruacions and ceremonies of the iewes as manye expositours hath fātasyed. For of that (like as Christ prophecied) ys not left one stone standinge vpon an other. But thys cyte ys the sure buyldinge of God / grounded vpon the stronge foūdacion of the Apostles ād Prophetes / euen vpon the harde rocke stone Iesus Christ. This is the plesaunt possessiō / the wholsom howsholde / the sure holde / and the dylectable vyneyarde

of the lorde of hostes. This ys the liuynge generacyon of them which feareth / loueth / and seketh their lorde God in faith sprete and veryte / and not in outwarde shaddowes. These are the childrē of promes / the true of springe of Abraham / the chosen howse of Israel / and the kyngedome of the holie ghost. Pure / cleane / ād holye hath Christ made this cyte / by nō other thinge but the onlye shedinge of his preciouse blood.
                  11 Thys cyte treade they vnder fote / that kepeth downe the treuthe of the gospel / that persecuteth & sleeth goddes people for it / that defeateth his worde for their owne tradicyons / that bryngeth in the Iewishe ceremonies / the gentyles supersticyons / paganes customes ād heythen vsages / yokynge menne with importable burdenes of false worshyppinges for theyr owne fylthye lucre and auauntage. Not withstādynge thus must they do styll by the sufferaunce of God / tyll the .xlij. monethes be finyshed / which ys not els but the tyme / the tymes / and the half tyme / or the thowsande / two hō

It must be geuen to the gentiles / or addict to their supersticyons / with all lyenge powre / sygnes / and wonders / in all deceyuable doctrine / by the subtile workinge of Sathā.

                        1 And I wyll geue powre sayth the lorde vnto my two faithfull witnesses / & they shall prophecie a thousande two hōdreth and .lx. dayes / ageynst those enemyes to the confort of my peple. So that though my cyte by troden downe by their cruell lawes of persecutiō to deathe / yet shall yt not be forsakē. And though my peple be ouerloaded with their heythen superstycyons and blasphemouse worshippinges / yet shal they not be lost nor left all wythout socoure.
                     2 They shal haue my .ii. wytnesses with them to solace thē in theyr trobles / and to confort thē in ther cares. Both Moyses and Christ / both the lawe and the gospell / both the prophetes & the apostles shall stande vpon their syde ād be vpon ther part: yea / for so moche tyme as ther enemies shall vexe thē / ād for so moche space as ther aduersaries shal troble thē Euen a thowsande two hondred and .lx. dayes / whych maketh thre yeare and an half / and is more then the .xlii. monethes by foure score dayes ād foure. Which signifieth that the enemies shal not euer more kepe downe his worde / but their dayes shall be shortened for his electes sake. The scole doctours with their sophistrie hath fantasied the sayd two wytnesses to be Enoch ād Helias / and that they shuld come then from paradyse terrestre

for the same puprose / because that Enoch was takē awaye of God / & Helias was carried hence in a fyery charet / neyther vnderstandinge what paradyse is / nor yet knowynge what yt is to be taken frō hēce. Paradyse is the swete rest of God appoynted vnto thē that depart hence in faythe. The peculiar trāslatiōs of Enoch and Helias were not onlye for a confirmacyon or strengthenynge of the fayth of the fathers for their tymes / but also that they shuld be figurs of Cristes ascencion. And what godlye wyse man can geue more to the figure than to the veryte: More were not they preuileged frō deathe thā was Christ / though God wolde not then haue yt so openly knowne / to declare hys wonderful powre. Unlyke is it that God shuld cal wytnesses from the dead not promisinge yt by his worde / hauinge powre also from stones to rayse vp Abrahams children / and to geue the sprete of Helias to whome he pleaseth / lyke as he ded to Iohan Baptist / and as he doth now to manye other more in our age / as all the worlde maye se and heare. These wytnesses are two / for so moche as the trewthe of the lorde in the mowthe of two or thre godlye persones ought to stande.
                     3 These two wytnesses or faythful procestours of the afore seyd two testamentes

/ hath continewed with the peple of God sens the death of Steuē / for the more part secretlye and vnknowne to the worlde. But now they are come a brode by the appoyntment of God to the vtter confusion of the great aduersarye and manne of synne as Paule doth call hym. And vnto them in thys sixt age of the churche the lord hath geuen the greate powre of hys lyuynge worde / or the sprete of his inuincyble veryte in moche more ample wyse then afore tyme / for the abatement of the seyd enemies or synagoge of perdycyon.
                     4 Clothed they shall be in sack clothe (sayth the lorde) No pompe shall apere in their aparell / no glorye of the worlde in their behauer. Neyther shal they be accompanyed with a garde of ruffelinge rutters. Neyther shal they with Annas and Caiphas syt vpon life and deathe. Neyther shal they blesse in the strete with myter / crosse / and cope. Neyther clayme the hyger seates in syde gownes shauen crownes / and typpettes. Neyther shal their be sacke fryres nor franciscanes / monkes / chanons / nor hipocrites. They shal not disfigure them selues to seme religiouse / nor saye longe prayers to apere holye / but in a sober conuersacion auoydynge superstuite / they shal cō
                        stātlye witnesse the truthe of God to the vniuersall

worlde / to his glorye and their edification. For sack clothe in the scripturs is a signe of sobryete / sadnesse / ād temperaū
                        ce / as in helias and Iohan Baptist.
                     5 These wytnesses are two swete olyue trees / shedynge forth the fatnesse of the scripturs / ād dulcet sauer of the sprete. God hath so blessed them / that their lippes are full of grace. He hath anoynted thē with the oyle of gladnesse aboue their fellawes / of myrre / bawme / & aloes they dilectably smelle.

For the worde of God ys the verye keye of Dauid / which openeth the kyngedome of God to thē that faythfullye beleueth / ād that speareth yt vp also from thē which dwelleth in vnfaithfulnesse. For it is sayd / in the dayes of their prophecyenge. This powre therfor is of the worde / and not of the menne. The worde speareth and openeth / losoneth and byndeth / saueth ād dāpneth. He that beleueth (sayth Crist) shall be saued / he that beleueth not is iudged alredye. No moyster of grace nor godly wysdome can lyght where sturdye frowardenesse is roted. The dayes of their prophecyenge in figure is non other than the aforesayd tyme / tymes / and halfe tyme / or the thre years and .vi. monethes of Helyas.
                     6 In those dayes shall it not rayne vpō the wycked / they shall haue no grace to receyue the veryte. In parables and figurs shall that be hydden from thē / that shall be euident ynowe vnto the faythfull. With eares shall they heare ād not vnderstande / with eyes shall they se and not discerue. So blynde wyll their hartes be. For soche spake the prophetes in

fygurs / Christ in parables / ād the Apostles in misteries. The open truthe of this reuelacion shall not the wycked perceyue / tyll they tast the plages therof. Soche is the nature of Gods wisdom / that thowgh it be not in gloriouse wordes / fyne paputed termes / nor in perswasible reasons of mānes wytte / but in playne symple speakynge / yet can it not be knowne of the worldly wise. The swete dewe therof will not be receyued of thē / in the aforesayd dayes of prophecie / but he that is blynde shall be blynde styll.
                     7 These wytnesses haue also powre ouer waters / to turne them into bloude. Whan they interprete and syncerely declare the pure berites of God / which are those wholsome waters that restrayneth the dāpnable drynesse of the sowle / that refresheth the conscyence / and clenseth the harte of the synner / they can not chose but ernestlye condempne the peruerse iudgementes / the couetouse lawes / and hypocritishe workes of the vngodlye. And then is all vncleane vnto them / thē is all bloodye. The gospell which was a stomblynge stone to the Iewes / ād mad folyshenesse vnto the gentyles / is also now vnto them nowrye newe lerninge / sediciouse doctrine / ād abhominable he resye. Yea / and they iudge them worthye to be burned that doth teache it. Thus

is it abhorred of them that shall perishe and neuerthelesse to thē that beleue / it is the powre of God vnto saluacyon.

Nothinge they esteme / but that whych ys earthlye. Nothinge they desyre / but that is carnall. The frowarde creature wyll in no case knowe that is of the sprete. The lyght ys hatefull vnto sore eyes Uerr peynefull is brede to the mouthe that ys not whole. A great mote was Crist to the Iewes / as hys true preachers are vnto the blynde worlde yet to thys daye. For they smyte the earthe.
                     9 They towche their lyuynge / they rebuke their falshede / they condēpne theyr wyckednesse. They reproue them of synne / of ryghtousnesse and of iudgement.

That fretteth thē at the very harte. Deathe must be sought out for soche preachers. No wonder is yt though thys be here writtē for thys age of the churche. For neuer were more ernest wytnesses then are now / and more are lyke here after to folowe / tyll the māne of synne be fullye knowne / and his kyngedome clerelye ouerthrowne.

After nō other sort shall they be sent hence / than he hath appoynted by hys eternall decre. Iohā baptist was not enprysoned nor beheaded / tyll he had done hys offyce. Christ was not taken / condemned / and crucyfyed tyl hys howre was come. Paule was not putt vnto deathe / tyl he had fulfilled his course.

                     3 These maketh warre ageynst Gods wytnesses / whan they hate them / curse them / blaspheme them / and persecute thē. Whan they withstande them with their craftes / impugne them with their lyes / and vexe them wyth their deuyllyshnesse / as necessarye it is they shuld do.

                     4 They shall also ouercome them / not with the scripturs / but with their beggerlye customes / constitucions / lawes / decrees & tradicyons. They shall scourge them or dysgrade them in their synagoges. They shall delyuer them vp to iustyces / debitees / and rewlers / makynge them their bothers ād slaues / so washinge their owne holye handes frō the shedynge of innocentes bloode.

And thowgh they laye no handes vpon them for soylynge their cōsecrate fyngars / yet must it be done by their ghostlye cownsel / ād ordred also after their spyrituall appoyntment.

They are those into whō the vncleane sprete hath entred with .vij. other spretes worse than hym self. With the sprete of falshede / the sprete of fylthynesse / the sprete of lyes / the sprete of wytchecrafte / the sprete of erroure / the sprete of blindenesse / ād the sprete of cruelte. And of these onlye with soche lyke are they spyrituall / and of no godlye sprete as their frutes declareth. And therfor the sprete of god doth iudge here this great cyte not to be called Hierusalē / but stinkinge Sodome / & most myserable Egypte / the prophecyes and other scripturs agreynge to the same. For loke what fylthynesse and abhomynacion was in Sodome / what Idolatrye and deuylyshnesse was in Egipt / the same is now reygnynge in this paynted spyritualte / and is accounted there great holynesse.
                     8 Amonge this consecrate multytude / or smered sort is Christ yet crucyfied / as he was amonge the Iewes whych knewe hym not / & yet boasted thē selues

outwardlye for the peculiar chosen peple of God. Not onlye ys Christ amonge thē persecuted / scourged / ponnyshed / ād put vnto deathe in hys membres / but also he ys proued of them an vnsufficyent Sauer without their dayly doynges. Their masses must be satysfactory sacrifices / profytinge both the quicke and the dead. And that must menne beleue vnder peyne of deathe and dampnacyon. Thus crucyfye they Christ ageyne / and make a mocke of hym as wytnessed Paule / and yet do they call hym their lorde / not vnlyke to the tormentours / whych crowned hym with thorne / and saluted hym with Aue rex Iudeorum.

No sonner was the yonge babe borne / but Herode for madnesse sought to slee hym in hys verye infancye. The Pharisees ād Scribes / the byshoppes / prestes / and lawers swelled at hys preachynge and neuer left tyll they had slayne hym. And this rewle with the prelates and hypocrytes hath contynued euer sens / and styl shall do tyll the latter daye.

                     1 And there apered / sayth Saynt Iohā) a great token in heauen▪ For no wonder ys thys token here to be taken / as in other places of the Scripture / but for a type or fygure / contayninge vnder mysterye greate thynges.
                     2 A woman was seane clothed with the sonne / yea / of Iohan▪ For to Gods onlye electes ys the veryte shewed to auauntage. Not Marye Christes mother ys this woman / though manye hath so fantasyed in their commentaryes. But yt ys the true christen churche of whom Marye ys a most notable member
                     3 Thys woman the churche (as Salomons cantycles specyfyeth) ys fayre / louelye / plesaunt / swete / wholsome / dilectable / vndefyled as the Mone / excellent in clerenesse as the sonne / and gloryous as an armye of menne with their banners and stremers. Thys woman ys bewtyfullye decked with the shynynge sonne of ryghtousnesse. Nō ys of her that hath not done on Iesus Christ / beynge renewed in their hartes by faythe. Her chyldren are not they that persecuteth Gods worde / no more than was Annas and Caiphas. Ioannes and Alexander.

                     5 And she was as ys the woman with chylde. She cryed trauelynge in byrthe / and was payned as one redye to be delyuered. With Christ ys the churche bygge whan her members are in full faythe. In the hart ys he euermore conceyued / and delyuered forth soche tyme as he ys declared vnto other. For thys cause Christ called them hys mother which had faythe and thervpon ded the wyll of hys father. Of faythe in the first promes that Christ shuld destroye the Serpent / was be first conceyued in Adam and Eua / and so grewe forth in ryghtouse Abell / in Seth / Enos / Enoch / Noe / Sem / Thare / Melchisedech / Abraham / and Loth. And as the promyses waxed stronger (as in Abraham / Moyses / Dauid / and the Prophetes) and the peple of God more in nombre / so wexed the woman byggar and byggar / tyll the fulnesse of her tyme was come that she shuld be delyuered. Which was soche tyme as Christ apered to the worlde / taught / and was cōuersaūt here amonge mēne. And this course haue she kepte euer sēs / & shall do to the latter daye in thē that beleue. Thus haue she had Christ in her wombe sens the beginninge.
                     
                        6 And beynge full of hys heauenlye sprete / she hath cryed in the Patriarkes and Prhphetes / in the Apostles & faythfull mynysters / as one trauelynge in byrthe. Her crye was the myghtye and stronge declaracyon of Christes doctryne / the feruent zele and desyre of the glorye of God / and of all-mennes helthe in Christ. She trauayleth euermore a newe lyke as ded Paule / tyll Christ be fashioned in her Christen members. Wyth all her strengthe she laboureth that the promysed Sede maye increase in the faythe of all menne.
                     7 Fynallye she ys payned with labours / dolours / blasphemyes / trobles / and terryble persecucyons / and neuer ys delyuered without them. Neuer ys Christ ernestlye receyued / tyll some of her membres doth suffre. The constaunt sprete and inuyncyble standynge by the truthe in them / hath conuerted manye. And lyke as the payned woman in all her agonyes / ys moche conforted by the hope of a chylde / so are Gods faythfull wytnesses / trustynge that by their pacyent and glad sufferaunce / Christ shuld be receyued and ryghtlye fashyoned in manye. Yea / thys causeth them to reyoce in all aduersite / and lyttle to esteme their paynes.

                     1 After thys (sayth Saynt Iohan) apered in heauen an other token or maruele / all dyuerse from the first. The true churche (which is Gods kingedome) was neuer yet without cōtradyccyō / nor with out the craftye assaultes of enemyes. Adam was not so sone created / but he was immedyatlye assaulted of Sathan. Christ entered not so sone the worlde / but he was bye and bye persecuted. The deuyll goeth aboute lyke a roaryngely on / sekynge whome he maye deuowre.
                     2 For beholde there was seane a great reed dragon / betokenynge the seyd deuyll with his whole retynewe / full of deceyt / craft / malyce / poyson / pryde / and fercenesse

Seldō ys ke out of the earthe / as wytnesseth Iob / but commonlye in the companye of menne / impugninge the faythfull. And no powre ys able to matche hym / vnlesse yt commeth from aboue.
                     3 The seyd dragon had seuen heades / sygnyfienge all the craftye wyles / and subtle suggestyons / that he hath practysed and vsed agaynst Christ & hys worde vnder all the .vij. seales openynge & the vij. trompettes blowynge▪ Verye easye yt is to cōiecture what maner of heades they were / markynge other places of the scripture. A Serpentes head shuld seme to be the first / consyderinge that in the Serpēt he deceyued our first parētes with his benemed craftes.

                     ¶The Paraphrase.
                     1 And there happened at that tyme (sayth saynt Iohan) a great battayle in heauen. In the churche is euermore variaū
                        ce and stryfe without ceasynge / betwixt the sprete and the fleshe / the good ād the badde / the faithfull and the vnfaithfull. Non other is this battayle but a verye contradiccion / a dyuersite in faythe / stodye / opynion / wyll / ād worke / about the lawes or commaundements of God / ād also about the lawes and tradycyons of menne. Thys battayle is wayghtye in cause / multitude / ād continuaunce. The cause therof is Christ / the gospell / faythe / rightousnesse / mannes helthe / Gods hygh honour / ād soche other lyke on the one partye. Vpon the other partye the cause is / errour / hipocrisie / lyes / ydolatrie / auarice / pryde / cruelte / fylthynesse / with all soche other. So great is the multitude / that non is fownde out of its Non is there but are in this armye. Eyther they are good or badde / faythfull or vnfaythfull / ryghtouse or vnrightouse. The rightouse are of the hoste of Michael

/ the vnrightouse are vpon the dragōs syde. Continued haue this battayle frō the first beginninge / and so shall styll to the latter ende. Yea / thowgh the dragon be bownde or tyed vp vnder the .vij. seale openynge / that he rage not then as he hath done afore. Yet shall the sprete of wyckednesse / and a mynde to do mischef reygne inwardlye styll in his members. for a Sathan can be but a Sathan / and a deuyll a deuyll.
                     2 Michael and his angels fought vale auntlye with the dragon. Spyrituall are they which hath done on Christ after the mynde of Paule / and spirituall is their armour. Their gyrdinge is verite / their brest plate rightousnesse / their shilde a sure faythe / their weapon the worde of God / their helmet the hope of helthe / and for stedefastnesse of their fete their showinge the gospell. By interpretacion is Michael to saye / who is as God? or who is lyke vnto God? And he betokeneth the constaunt ministers and syncere teachers of the gospell. The angels of Michael are all they that in a sure faythe confesseth the eternall magnificence of God / and that non is lyke vnto hym. Contrarye wyse the dragons angels are the hipocrites / lyēge prophetes / and erronyouse teachers.
                     3 These fyght with the dragon / and the

dragon and hys angels with them. For he that ys not with Christ / ys agaynst hym. With the ryghteouse ys Michael. For mynystrynge spretes are the angels ordayned for the confort of them which shall be saued. And commanded they are to wayte vpō the faythfull / to preserue and defende them. The wycked sort haue the deuyll & hys chaplaynes to fyght for them / the ryghtouse haue Michael and hys angels. The wycked fyghteth with errours ād lyes / the ryghteouse with the onlye veryte of God.
                     4. As vengeable and as ferce as they are / yet preuayle they not / neyther ys theyr place fownde anye more in heauen. Faythe hath the vyctorye by the promyse of God / though the blynde worlde seyth it not. Ouercomen are the wycked whā their enterpryses taketh not / and cleane ouerthrowne whā their beggerye ys contempned. And neuer ys the full vyctorye gottē / no more than yt was in Christ / tyll the tabernacle of thys bodye be layed a syde. At that daye ys the crowne gotten / whom the lorde hath layed vp for the ryghtouse. And lyke as there ys daylye fyghtynge / so ys there in some / daylye vyctorye. Dayly are the angels of darkenesse ouerthrowne / daylye are they cast out of heauē / whych ys the true churche. Daylye are they cōdēpned

by the worde of God / & iudged for rebels agaynst the holye Ghost / whose synne ys neuer forgeuen.
                     5 No place haue they anye more with the chosen / no eleccyon nor acceptacyon / afore God. The more light they haue had & the more they haue tasted of the truthe now forsakinge yt & rebellyng against yt with the deuill / the farder they are frō God / & the more nygh vnto dāpnacyon. Neuer beleued he trulye / that so had receyued the worde. Lett nō thynke to be saued / vnlesse he perseuereth to the ende.
                     6 And the great Dragō / or captayne of all the vnfaythfull sort / that olde croked Serpēt whych deceyued Adā & ys called the deuyll or malycyouse accuser / yea / & also Sathan the most cruell aduersarye with all hys elyentes & spirituall adherentes / are certayne & sure to be cast out.
                     7 With the ryghtouse shall they haue no porcyon for all their gloriouse tytles. With the godlye shall not their names be regestred / for all their holye vnccyōs. But with the prince of this worlde they shall be throwne forth.
                     8 For he by them / & they by hym / hath deceyued all the worlde / in lyenge tokēs & wōders / & in the operacyō of errours / to the vtter dāpnacyon of all thē that cō

All grace ād goodnesse hath he takē frō them / and in all darkenesse hath he lefte them. Nothinge is now behynde but helle fyre / prepared for the deuyll ād his angels. The churche thus first bryngynge forth Christ amonge the Iewes / ād so by their cruelte dryūe out into the wyld desert of the Gentyles / hath bene there fedde of God in persecucyon euer sens / ād shall be styll tyll the terme come out of the aforesayd thowsande / two hondreth / and thre score dayes / whose ende is in the lordes handes.

                     1 And I harde a myghtye great voyce (sayth saynt Iohā) which is the whole agremēt of all the sacred scripturs. And the voyce sayd thus vnto me.
                     2 Now is there in heauē saluacion. In the churche is the helthe of sowle now that the Idolatrie with other abhominacions is throwne forth / & she cleane delyuered frō their beggerie. Now apereth the power of the lorde / that his gospell is trulye preached.
                     3 Now is it become our Gods kyngedome / that their doctrine is not of menne.

                     5 For the enemye of oure bretherne is throwne downe / which cruellye accused thē before God daye and nyght. The ad̄uersarye Sathā which quareled before the lorde agaynst paciēt Iob / and vexed hym sore in hys substaūce and fleshe / neuer ceasynge to thys daye to troble the ryghtouse with Antichristes and tyrauntes / ys now ouer comen by the vyctorye of faythe / and hys power greatlye demynyshed in hys members. Now is the kingedome of God increased / moche peple beinge vnfaynedlye cōuerted vnto Christ

lyon for the more cruelte now vsed than was in those dayes) the proude kyngedomes of the Assyryanes and Caldeanes. To the Beare the cruell kyngedomes of the Medes and Parthyanes. And vnto the Catte of the mountayne / the vnstedefast kyngedome of the Grekes. Of pryde / spoyle / and roborye are the Assyrianes and Caldeanes condempned by Esaye / Nahum / and Abacuch the Prophetes. The Medes and Parthianes helde captyue the peple of God / as wytnesseth Hester / Paralipomenon / and Esaye.

                     1 And one of his heades (sayth Saynt Iohan) semed vnto me / as it had bene wounded vnto deathe. And it was not so in dede / for his deadlye wounde was healed agayne. Euydent it is that in Iohans tyme / Rome the mother of all who redome had subiect vnto her the .vij. clymates or vniuersall partes of the worlde / with all their powers / gouernours / kynges / possessions / pompes / false worshyppinges / and soche lyke. Whome some writers suppose mete to be taken here for the .vij. heades of this beast. But I fynde an other thynge in it / the bodye of these .vij. heades beynge but one / and styll contynuynge so. For thowgh all were at that tyme vnder her / yet is it not so now / ād yet styll remayneth this beast. Therfor I do take it for one vnyuersall Antichrist (as I ded afore) comprehendynge

in hym so well Mahomete as the Pope / so well the ragynge tyraunt as the styll hypocrite / and all that wyckedlye worketh are of the same bodye. The seuen heades of this Beast / maye so well be his presumptuouse doinges for the .vij. ages of the churche / as anye thynge els / and yet no preiudyce done to that hath bene sayed afore. What shuld ayle this wounded head here / not to sygnyfye his supremyte suppressed / his vsurped auctoryte and power dyminihsed / and his whole prodygyouse occupyenge condempned in this latter age of the churche? I suppose nothynge more manifes

                         / vnlesse we haue eyes ād wyll not se. Are not now in manye partes of Germanye / and in Englande also the Popes pardons layed asyde? His power put downe / his name abolyshed / his purgatorye / pelgrimages / and other peltryes vtterlye exyled? and so lyke to be wythin short space in other regyons also? If thys be not a deadlye woundynge of one of the Beastes heades / I thynke there is non. If thys be not an apparent lykelyhode of his falle / there is non to be loked for.
                     2 But the healynge agayne of this mortall wounde is lyke to marre all / and make the last errour worse thā the first.

In manye places where as the gospell hath bene preached / the Byshoppe of Rome deposed / sectes shrynes and sanctuaries destroyed / monasteries / prioryes and fryeryes turned ouer / remayneth styll their poyson / with those same instrumētes wherwith they haue wrought all myschef. Styll continueth their more than Iewyshe ceremonyes / their prestybulouse presthode / their vowynge to haue no wyues / and their Sodomyticall chastite. Styll remayneth their sale masses / of all abhominaciōs the principall / their prodigiouse sacrifices / their sensynge of Idols / their boyeshe processyons / their vncommaunded worshyppinges / and their confessions in the eate / of all trayterye the fountayne / wyth manye other straūge obseruacyons whō the scripture of God knoweth not. Nothynge is brought as yet to Christes clere institucyon and syncere ordynaunce / but all remayneth styll as the Antichrystes lefte it. Nothyng is tryed by Gods worde / but by the auncyent auctoryte of fathers. Now passeth all vnder theyr tytle. Thowgh the olde Byshoppes of Rome were of late years proued Antichrystes / and theyr names raced out of owr bokes / yet must they thus properlye for olde acquaytaunce be called styll owre fathers. If it were nought afore

/ I thynke it is now moche worse. For now are they become lawdable ceremonyes / where as before tyme they were but ceremonyes alone. Now are they become necessarye rytes / godlye constitucyons / semelye vsages / and cyuyle ordynaunces / where as afore they had no soche names. And he that dysobeyeth them shall not onlye be iudged a fellon and worthye to be hanged by their newe forged lawes / but also condempned for a traytoure agaynst hys kynge / though he neuer in hys lyfe hyndred but rather to his power hath furdered the common welthe. To se this also wyth soche lyke put in execucyon / the Byshoppes haue auctoryte euerye moneth in the yeare yf they lyst / to call a sessyon / to hange and borne at theyr pleasure. And thys is ratyfyed and confermed by acte of Perlament to stande the more in effect. If thys be no healynge of Antichristes wounded head / neuer is lyke to be anye. Whan menne shall defende fre wyll / and allowe their popyshe Masse to be a sacrifyce fatysfactorye for the quycke and the dead / latoure they anye other (thynke yow) than the healynge of thys wounder He lykewyse that in an open

audyence mainteyneth owr owne workes to iustifye / by Dimitte nobis / and other not ryghtlye vnderstanded scripturs / doth he anye other than prepare a salue for the same? Nay surelye. No lesse also doth he that setteth menne to open penaunce at Paules crosse / for holye water makynge / for procession and sensynge with other popetishe gawdes / constraynynge them to promyse the anauncement of the olde faythe of holye churche by soche fantasticall fopperyes / as Bonner bishopp of London ded now of late / to the lawhynge game and wonderment of all the worlde. Alas how is the peple abused? Non other do they but mocke Christen princes with flatterye / that geue them olde popyshe tytles and blasphemouse names of Antichrist. As to call them most Christen kynges and defenders of the catholike faythe / meaninge the Popes olde tradicions / to heale the head of the beast. This is surelye non other / but with the sayd Beast to receyue auctoryte / seate / and power of Sathan. Lete them therfor take hede least they be fownde the same Antichristes that they haue condempned / and so throwe them selues double vnder the same plage. Necessarye it is they beware what they drynke / or what tytles they take vpon them at their appoyntment

                     3 And all the worlde (sayth saynt Iohan) wondred at the Beast. All folyshe / carnall / and worldlye peple / not vnderstandynge the wysdome of Gods holye sprete / depēdeth all vpon their beastlye baggage / thinkinge all that they do to be godlye / meritoryouse / & spirituall. They magnifye it / prayse it / and haue it in most hygh estimacion / yea / they haue it in moche more pryce than anye thinge that is of God. In no wyse wyll they from their olde frenesye / soche is their excedinge blindenesse. For whan they here tell / their customes shall continewe / their gouernours agreynge to the same / they clappe their handes for Ioye / and synge Gaudeamus with the prestes.
                     4 Yea / they worshypp the Dragon which gaue soche power to the Beast: With their hartes they reioyce trustinge vpon longer contynuaunce / whan they se his head restored agayne in their rewlers / the godlye teachers burned / ād the preachers put to sylence.
                     
                        5 They worship also the Beast / so manye as worshipped the Dragon. For as they which worship Christ / worship his father also / so they that worship Antichrist / agreynge to his lawes and decrees / doth also worship the deuyll / of whom he receyued his pryde.

                     ¶The Paraphrase.
                     1 To this beast (sayth Iohan) was geuen a mouthe / not of God but of Sathan / to speake great mightye thinges and blasphemies. So well is this spoken of the one as the other / so manye as hath done vpon the Antichristes lyuerye / title / power / auctorite / or name. Whan the veryte of the lorde was opened before them / they gaue no thankes for it / but became vayne in their thoughtes / wherfor God gaue them ouer into a lewde mynde / darkenynge their hartes. So that now thynkinge them selues wyse / they apere more folyshe than afore.
                     2 Now speake they great thynges in theyr conuocacyons seanes and sermons / and all are sore blasphemyes agaynst God & his Crist. Now must they serue God by most streyght commaundement with olde Romyshe beggerye / though he most hyghlye abhorreth it / ād no scrypturs maye be red in the tyme therof. For the scripturs must onlye passe

as we wyll haue them. How shuld the Beastes head els be healed agayne / or how shuld our churche be knowne els to be his owne Image? Oh beastlye abhomynacion / and most hellyshe decre. Now must Christ be taken for no sauer at all without owr deseruynges. The supper of the lorde that was sumtyme a mutuall pertycypacyon of Christes bodye and bloud / must now be a newe crucyfyenge of him / one traytoure playnge all partes / Iudas / Annas Cayphas / Herode / Pylate / and the Iewes. Matrimonye must be iudged vnclennesse thowgh it be the ernest institucyon of God. No Popyshe vowe maye be dissolued / though it be well knowne a matter so deuilyshe / as hath made an hondreth thowsande Sodomytes. The Eucharystye maye not be receyued in both kyndes / thowgh it be the expresse commaundement of Christ so to be vsed. Without the blynde bussynges of a Papyst / maye no synne be soluted / for that is the vpholdynge of theyr kyngedom / wyth manye other lyke blasphemyes. Certen other great thynges are vttered by this mouthe / which now I passe ouer least I shuld be tedyouse to the reader. How be it thys one great blasphemye that ys spoken / I can not leaue vntowched.
                     
                        Where as they boast thēselues yet styll alone to be the holye churche / by the onlye vertu of their vnccyons and shauynges receyued first of the pope / the layte secluded. And vndre thys most falselye vsurped tytle / they wyll styll be takē for the redemers of mēnes sowles. For they saye that their Masses are satysfactorye sacryfyces for the quycke and the dead / iustyfienge / releuynge / and sauynge thē both from dampnacyon / ex opere operato. And ouer that abhominable swarme of Antichristes fylthye mynysters / make they now their kynges the heades most blasphemously / onlye to be by them vpholden now in all their myscheues. Truthe yt is that a kynge is the

                        polytyque head / supreme gouernour / ād great staye vndre God / of the peple to hys charge commytted / & after that sort / their myghtie monarke also by the scripturs / which they haue afore thys tyme denyed / worshyppinge them for most holye sayntes / which haue most presumptuouslye rebelled in that behalfe. But ouer that whoryshe churche of theirs (whom Chryst neuer planted) is Sathan the onlye head / by the holye Ghostes fore iudgementes here. For to that beastlye brode gaue the Dragon hys power / hys seate / and hys myghty auctoryte. God forbidde therfor that anye Christen prynce shuld at their

false suggestyōs / admitt so blasphemouse a tytle. The deuyll (sayth Iob) ys the onlye head ouer all the chyldren of pryde. That voyce therfor maye be blasphemouse / as commynge from the mouthe of the serpent / yf yt be not take good hede to.
                     3 *And power was geuen to the Beast to do these thynges for the space of .xlij. monethes / which is the .iij. years and an half of Helyas / the tyme / tymes / ād half tyme of Danyell / ād the thowsande two hondred and thre score dayes of Iohan. Not onlye for thys age of the churche / but also for all other ages / and by other heades also / hath the mouthe of thys Beast vttered great thinges in blasphemy / lyes in Hypocresye / and wonders vnder a deceytfull power. But as concernynge thys latter healed head of the Beast / the tyme therof wyll be short / as here after shall ap

Manye entreth thys heauen of the lorde / but all contynueth not in yt to the ende of their lyues / the more ys the pyte.
                     5 Power was also geuen vnto this beastlye Antichrist / / to make battayle with the sayntes / and to ouercome them. Contynuallye do they with vyolence vexe by their cer

They seke here / they honte there / and neuer leaue ragynge tyll they haue closed them vp in presons.

Eyther shall they be compelled shamefullye to recante / or yf they persyst in the veryte / to suffer most peynefull deathe. By one waye or other they must be ouercomē / to holde the peple in erroure.

In dede yt is truthe. For neyther Christ nor hys Apostles ded euer yet ouercome yow.

Yet do ye well to holde vp a proude pecockes head as longe as ye maye.

                     8 For all that dwelle vpon earthe must worshyp thys Beast. They must agree to the great thynges / no remedye. They must blaspheme God as they do. But blessed be the lorde / nō doth that in their hartes but they onlye that dwell vpon the earthe / that haue their felycyte here / that seketh the prosperyte of thys worlde / and regardeth non other lyfe than therin is. The lambes of Christes folde geueth hede to hys voyce / they regarde hys calle / they folowe hys worde / they walke in hys lyght.

                     9 And therfor are not their names written of the lābe in the boke of lyfe / which lambe was slayne from the begynnynge of the worlde. Christ hath not allowed them by hys worde and promes. With the ryghtouse are they not regestred / as members of one mystycall bodye in hym. In the similitude of hys deathe are they not grafted vnto hym as the braunches vnto the vyne / to be partyners of hys resurreccyon. Their porcyon ys not in the lande of the lyuynge with hym. They are non of those / whom the father hath geuen hym / to partycipate with hym in one sprete. Predestynate they are not vnto lyfe by hym / nor so written vp in the foreknowlege of God.

The hartes of the vnfaythfull it so hardeneth / that they in disdayne and spyght doth call it newe lernynge / as ded the ignoraunt multitude at Capernaum / and the worldly wyse menne of Athenes.
                     10 Before the seate of the lorde was this songe vttred / which is the godlye disposed multitude. For lyke as the harte of an hipocrite is the verye seate of sathan / so is the hart of a faythfull manne the seate of God and habitacle of the holye Ghost.
                     11 Before the .iiii. Beastes was it opened also by this nomber of godlye teachers. Which Beastes are the pryuate congregacions of the lorde / remayninge here yet in the fleshe / in the .iiii. quarters of the worlde.

This Angell here mencyoned is non other than he that had the seale of the lyuynge God in the vii. Chapter / and he that was clothed wyth a clowde in the tenth chapter.

                     2 He flyeth in the myddes of heauen. An ernest / feruent / and faythfull course take they in the middes of Gods congregacion (which is his heauenlye kyngedome here / to whō this reuelacion is written / lyke as ded Paulus / Sylas / & Barnabas / Timotheus / Titus / and Clemēs / with other of the Apostles / syncerelye to declare his worde. Mightye stomaked are they in Gods cause / both in their wordes and wrytinges.
                     3 An euerlastinge gospell had this angell to preache vnto them that sytte and dwell vpon the earthe / & to all nacions / kynredes / and peple. His eternall testament and couenaunt of peace hath the lorde geuen vnto them / to preache delyueraunce to the captiue / helthe to the wounded / lyfe to the dead / and remission to the sinnefull. Yea / to vtter that worde that is stronger than is heauen or earthe / and that shall neuer fayle him that trulye beleueth.
                     4 The sounde of this gospell must go the worlde ouer / as in the Apostles tyme. Euery where must it be spredde to the increase of faythe. Amonge all nacions

of the earthe / amonge all kynredes of the Israelytes / amonge all lāguages of the worlde / ād amonge all kyndes of peple / of what sort so euer they be / whether they sytte vpon the earthe or dwell vpon the earthe / whether they be hygh or lowe / gouernours or subiectes / masters or seruauntes / owners or fermers. So that they sytt not nor dwell not within the earthe / or haue their felicyte here. For that is holye shuld not be geuen vnto dogges / nor yet pearles layed before swyne.
                     5 And he cryed wyth a lowde voyce. With a mightye feruent sprete do they beate it into the heades of menne / both by wordes / writinges / and all they can make / to haue the feare of God / and to geue him his dewe honoure. And this is the doctrine they teache / and the counsell they geue.
                     6 Feare ye God in all that ye do for the first poynt of godlye wysdome is to dreade least we offende him. Be constaunt in the worde / ād feare no displeasure of menne. For nomore can they do in their anger but slee the bodye / and brynge it to the rest of God. No power haue they ouer the sowle. Feare him onlye therfor / that whan he hath destroyed both / maye throwe them into helle.
                     7 Geue honour vnto him / worship him / 

and serue him alone. Prayse him / ād glorifye him aboue all. But yet after non other sort thā he hath appoynted / which is in faythe / sprete / and veryte / and not in outwarde shaddowes with obseruacyon of tymes. He trulye honoureth him that trusteth in hym / that beleueth hys worde / and that in spyght of all Antychristes confesseth it afore all menne. After this sort therfor feare him / and worshyp him / nothynge doubtynge the assaultes of enemyes.
                     8 For the howre of his iudgement ys come. At hande is it that all the Antychristes and hipocrites shall by the invincyble worde of God be iudged / condempned / and destroyed. From heauen shall his wrathe be declared vpō all their vngodlynesse. With the sprete of his mouthe shall the lorde consume thē / and not longe after wyll the great daye of his indignacion towardes them lyght sodenlye vpon them.
                     9 With all faythfull obsequy worship him therfor that create heauē and earth in wonderfull strengthe and bewtye.

                     1 And I sawe (sayth saynt Iohan) by the secrete goodnesse of my lorde God / yet an other token in heauen / great and maruelouse / straunge and wonderfull. For in the churche or congregacyon of God are euermore vttred his wonderfull and depe iudgementes / vnto them only whom his grace appoynteth / as vnto Iohan. And this is the token in mysterye.
                     2 Seuen angels had in their hādes the seuen last plages. Some exposytours haue taken these Angels for the ryght mynisters in the .vij. ages of the christen churche. Some haue thought them to be the peruerse preachers and vngodly mynisters of all the sayd ages / suffred of God strongelye to delude the vnbeleuers / that he which hurteth shuld hurte styll / and that he which is in fylthynesse shuld styll be fylthye. Vnto euerye age correspondynge an Angell / to declare the nature of those deceytfull hyrelynges

and lyenge masters. And this maketh them so to vnderstande the text. They are here expreslye noted to be in heauen. Amonge the congregacyons of God are the false prophetes and dissemblynge hypocrites euermore / as the chaffe amonge the corne / the tares amonge the wheate / and the fylthye dregges amonge the pure wyne. For that kyngedome is as a nette throwne into the see and gatherynge all maner of fyshes both good and badde. In all ages hath the wycked generacyon increased / to impugne the truthe / and styflye to stande vp agaynst God and his Christ / whych is non other after their myndes / than to mynistre the .vij. last plages here.

to be vttered. For all these thynges are ioyntlye to be consydered. These Angels came not onlye from heauen / which is the congregacyon (as they haue mencyoned) but also out of the celestyall temple of the tabernacle of testimonye / which is the omnipotēt God and his Chryst / as the .xxi. chapter here of declareth. They are also clothed with pure whyght lynnen / gyrded with golden gyrdels / they haue golden vyals delyuered vnto them by one of the .iiij. Beastes / and one of them commonèth with Iohan / declarynge vnto him the iudgement ād fall of the great whore. Which are no argumentes that they are here to be taken for yll preachers / thowgh they here mynistre the last .vij. plages. Therfor shall we iudge them here to be Gods appoynted purposes or eternallye decreed pleasurs / agaynst the wylfull obstynates and indurate rebellyous to the ende of the worlde. These are called the last plages / bycause they fall in the last age of the worlde / whom Esaye / Hieremye / Oseas and Mycheas calleth the last dayes / Iohan the last howre / and Paule the endes of the worlde. Seuen are they named here in a vniuersal respect both of the tymes / parsones / places / and peruerse doctrynes

of the whole worlde. And also because of the .vij. seales and the .vij. trompettes / to whose iudgementes they Ioyntlye agre / as in the next chapter folowinge wyll apere more largelye.
                     3 For in them (sayth the text) is fulfylled the wrathe of God. The indignacyon of the lorde is in them whollye declared. For what hate can he shewe more vnto manne / than to withdrawe from him his grace / to leaue him to him self / to suffre him in his owne blynde iudgementes / to geue hym ouer to his owne fylthye lustes / and to sende hym the operacyon of erroure to his double dampnacyon? A verye fulfyllynge of Gods anger is it also to appoynt vs a false Prophete or deceyuable curate / a wanton Prynce or vngodlye gouernoure. These therfor with soche lyke are those plages / in whom is depelye accomplyshed the dyspleasure of God. And they are here named the last plages / for after them shall non other be seane / the latter daye fynyshynge and clearynge all.
                     4 And I behelde (sayth Saynt Iohan) in the same sayd vysyon / as it were a glassye see / or a great flowynge water in symylytude of glasse / all myngled wyth fyre. Non other is this see but the precyouse veryte of the Lorde / 

so clere as glasse and so pure as christall. This see gushed out of the harde rocke stone / that was clouen a sonder in the desart. Whan he sent forth his sprete / these waters flowe

                         forth in habundaunce.
                     5 Most effectuall and quycke is this see. And therfor it is here noted as myngled with fyre / whych signifyeth the holye ghost. For neuer is the veryte wythout Gods sprete. A ferce fyerye streme calleth Danyel this see. All fyerye is thy worde lorde (sayth Dauid also) and therfor thy seruaunt loueth it. This is the foūtayne of lyuynge water spryngynge vp into the lyfe euerlastynge. Vnto this water shuld all they resort that are thurstye / therof to take refreshynge.
                     6 Vpon this glassye see were they sene of Saynt Iohan / that had obtayned victorye of the Beast / of hys Image / of his marke / and of the nombre of his name. By whom are ment those constaunt christianes / whych hath for all ages firmelye affermed the truthe. For non aduersyte declinynge from it. Strongelye haue these sens the Apostles tyme resysted the aduersaries of God by his only worde / perfystynge therin vnto the deathe as ded Steuen / Iames / and Antipas with soche other his faythfull witnesses.

Uictorye haue they gotten by faythe both of the Beast ād his Image / both of the great Antychryst and his supporters / of the Pope and of Mahomete / wyth theyr maynteyners Emprours / kynges / and magistrates / and of all them that vsurpe theyr tytle / name / seate / auctoryte / pompe or power.
                     7 They haue blemyshed lykewyse by the sayd worde not onlye the marke of the Beast / whych is a corrupted faythe / but also the nombre of hys name / whych is the denyall of God. Them haue they to theyr rebuke vttered / and to their confusion declared. They haue proued their orders dampnable / their doctrine deuyllyshe / their religion hypocrisye / and their spiritualte playne wyckednesse / condempnynge them by the scripturs / as vngodlye dyssemblers denyenge the lorde which bought them. These are they whom the lorde tenderlye norryshed / and gracyouslye brought forth vpon the refreshynge waters / conuertynge their sowles to his godlye feare and loue.
                     8 These stande euermore on the glassye see / they sett sure fotynge vpon the rocke stone. Unmoueablye they perseuer in the truthe / neuer denyenge yt afore menne.
                     9 And they haue in their handes the

harpes of God / whych are deuoure myndes geuen all vnto godlynesse / ād reioysynge in spirituall thynges.
                     10 Harmonyouslye they synge the tuneable songe of Moyses the faythfull seruaunt of God / and the melodyouse swete songe of the lambe Iesus Christ.
                     11 Of both testamentes they make vtteraunce / declarynge the wonderfull workes and terrible iudgementes out of the olde lawe / and out of the gospell of gladnesse the most swete mercye of the lorde. Wythout ceasynge open they the scripturs vnto other inwardlye reioysinge in spirituall hymnes and psalmes / hauynge this euermore for the standynge tenoure of their songe.
                     12 Inestimablye great is thy goodnesse / and wonderfullye maruelouse are thy workes O Lorde God almyghtye.
                     13 Iust are thy promyses / and most perfightlye sure thy wayes / thu gloriouse kynge of Sayntes / and graciouse gyde of the godlye beleuers.
                     14 Who shall not euermore feare the / o mightye lorde? who shall not alwayes in hart gloryfye / thy blessed name?
                     15 Thu alone art holye / iust / ād perfight / for non is there good but thy self onlye. Thu art owre onlye maker / redemer / ād

cōfortoure. Non other haue we for owre God but the.
                     16 No doubt of it but the tyme will be that all kyndes of peple / both Iewes and Gentyles / faythfull and heythen shall seke vnto the / and shall faythfullye in veryte and sprete worship before the / acknowlegynge the for their onlye lorde God.
                     17 Because thy wonderfull iudgementes that sumtyme were secrete / are now to the worlde made openlye knowne ād manifest. Though this songe be lyttle and small / yet is therin contayned all veryte / that both Moyses and Christ confesseth at large. Moreouer what so euer the scripturs comprehendeth / eyther of the great omnipotēcye of God or of his most wonderfull workes / eyther of hys louinge mercye or of his benigne pytie towardes manne / of his gloriouse name or myghtye power / or that he is to be magnifyed and feared / or how that the faythfull perteyneth only to his kingedome / or how that all peple shall finallye be conuerted vnto hym. All is compendiouslye in this brefe songe here contayned / what though it be not so worde by worde expressed. And as concernynge that ys here last spoken / that his iudgementes are made manyfest / it is to be vnderstanded of those

faythfull creaturs whom he calleth / clereth and iustyfyeth / and of non other. For vnto them onlye are his heauenlye verit

Though the other outwardlye se the iudgements of God / yet do they not inwardlye perceyue thē / though they boast it neuer so moche. For it is not geuen them so to do. They must haue eyes and not se / eares and not vnderstande.

haue owr beynge. The tabernacle of wytnesse is the lambe Iesus Christ. He is that verye tabernacle of God that was here amonge menne / bearinge that faythfull wytnesse which geueth wysdome to babes. He is the propiciatorye or mercye seate / wherin we are harde and forgeuen. Neyther was thys tabernacle of thys maner buyldynge / but moche more perfyght and greatter. This holye tabernacle is within the aforesayd temple / for Christ dwelleth in the father and the father in him.
                     3 Open is this temple in heauen / and the tabernacle seane / whan God is knowen by true preachynge / and Chrystes doctrine beleued. For he came into the worlde / and for that purpose was borne / to beare wytnesse vnto the truthe / whom the father wylled onlye to be harde / concernynge faythe.
                     4 This temple and tabernacle open / or God and his worde ones knowne in thys latter age / the seuen Angels cometh forth. The eternall decrees of Gods secrete iudgementes apereth / and are fulfylled in their tymes. As Angels or massengers of God they haue in his eternyte their iust plages in their season appoynted to be exhybited.
                     5 And therfor are they seyd to come

out from the temple which is God. Nothynge hath he purposed to the worlde / but he hath decreed yt afore the worldes constitucyon. For his purpose / mynde / and pleasure / is as he is / euerlastynge. And as it falleth to the worlde by his assignement / it becometh a massenger / goynge out of the temple. So manye hath he sent of soche massengers / as he hath fulfylled decreed purposes. And maruele not though they be here called Angels / consyderynge that it ys the common maner of the holye scrypturs euermore to call them Angels whych vttereth the wyll / pleasure / and commaundement of God / as they do here. After thys sort are the prestes called Angels / so ys Aggeus the holye Prophete / so is Saynt Iohan Baptyst / so are Chrystes dyscyples / and also the publyque preachers.
                     6 What the plages are that they shall shed out of theyr vyals / wyll be shewed clerelye in the next chapter folowynge / one after an other.
                     7 These angels are aparelled in pure whyght lynnen / bryght shynynge as chrystall / and gyrded about theyr brestes with gyrdels of fyne golde / which betokeneth theyr syncere clennesse / 

and their gloryouse perfyghtnesse. For what can be more pure and precyouse / than the eternall decrees of the lorde? What can be more perfyght and gloryouse than hys prediffyned purposes? The lawes of God are vndefyled / the testimonyes are true / the statutes are ryght / the wayes are sure / the commaundementes are clere / the iudgementes are godlye / the wordes are pure and precyouse. Yea / the gyftes that come from the father of lyght are euermore perfyght and good.
                     8 The gyrdynge of their brestes / ys the streyght spearynge vpp of the secrete meanynge of Gods iudgementes from owr carnall vnderstandynge / tyll soche tyme as he openeth them vnto vs by hys sprete. For yt belongeth not vnto vs to decerne soche secretes as the father reserueth to hys owne power.

                     10 The vyals of Gods wrathe are the vngodly reprobates / fytt onlye for destruccyon. Golden are they here named / because they apere gloryouse in the worldlye iudgementes of menne. Verye paynted tombes are the dyssemblynge hipocrites / within full of stynkinge bones. A shynynge name of lyfe haue they and yet are they inwardlye dead. For all that they do is to be seane of menne.
                     11 Full of wrathe are they / wherbye is ment a synnefull vnderstandynge / with dampnable doctrynes. For verye swyft are they to all vngodlynesse. The .vi. propertees haue they which the lorde hateth / and the seuenth which he vtterlye abhorreth. A proude loke / a dissemblynge tonge / bloudye handes / a wycked hart / fere rydye vnto myschef / wayes to practyse lyes / and sowynges of dyssencyon

amonge bretherne. These are geuen of the true christen congregacion to the .vij. Angels / or decreed purposes of God to be iudged as they haue eternallye diffyned. For non other is their continuall prayer / but that his wyll be fulfylled / and that his predyfined intentes agaynst the peruerse multytude be fynyshed at their conuenyent tymes. Non other is it to putt into the Angels handes the vyals of Gods displeasure / than thus to committ them by faythfull prayer to his purposed decrees or foreset ordinaunces.
                     12 But because that commonlye whan Gods iudgementes begynne to waxe knowne / all thynges are commoued and trobled / therfor is it sayd here consequentlye that the temple was full of smoke / by reason of the mageste of God and of his gloryouse power. This smoke are serten mysteryes / representynge vnto vs the hydden mageste of Gods eternall presence. Whose bryghtnesse can no frayle vnderstandynge abyde. Nor / all the worlde cowde not sustayne it yf all thynges were open and playne concernynge it. In no wyse coulde Moyses presentlye se the face of God / onlye myght he be suffred to se his backe partes. For no manne can se God and lyue. Onlye is he seane here in this

lyfe as in a glasse or vnder a darke speakynge. He apereth vnto vs here in a mystycall smoke / lyke as he ded to the Patriarke Iacob in slepe / to Moyses in the flamynge bushe / to Helias in the horle wynde / to the Apostles in fyerye tonges / and vnto Ananias in a secrete vysyon.
                     13 Vnder the shaddowe of fygurate locucyon is his glorye of the electe persones and faythfull beleuers knowne. The vnfaythfull reprobates beholdeth the smoke / but neyther perceyue they in it the glorye of God / nor the mageste of his presence. They neyther conceyue his wonderfull workes / nor yet his godlye iudgementes. Their folyshe hartes are so darkened / that though they knowe God / yet glorifye they him not. They set the smoke and perceyue the worlde trobled (as it is alwayes whan the veryte apereth) but neuer the more faythe nor godlye knowlege haue they. But that which is vnto the faythfull a rayse / is vnto thē a ruyne. That is vnto the other the power of God vnto helthe / is vnto them slaunder and folyshnesse. And that is vnto the other a sauoure of lyfe vnto lyfe / is vnto them a sauoure of deathe vnto deathe. They remember not that the lorde came downe in fyre vnto Moyses vpon mount Synay whan it smoked

all togyther lyke a burnynge fornace / and therfor bere they awaye no glorifyed faces / or consciences depured by a true perfyght faythe.
                     14 And no manne was able (sayth the text) to enter into the tēple / tyll the .vij. deadlye plages of the .vij. angels were whollye fulfylled. For though the true beleuers perceyue in the misteries of the scripturs / the present mageste and mygh tye power of God / yet enter they not in to full knowlege of him / beynge as yet subiect vnto vanyte. For here is theyr knowlege vnperfyght / and their prophecyenge also. And therfor acknowlegynge their imbecillite / and also waytynge for the reuelacion of the childrē of God / they saye with Saynt Paule. O the wō

                     15 And at this poynt. shall they styll be tyll the last iudgement daye fynishe all. For the full enterynge into the temple is non other than a whole perfyght or consummate knowlege of God ād hys misteryes. Which can not fullye be had / tyll that which is vnperfyght be done awaye / the creature delyuered from bondage of corrupcyon. And tyll deathe be swallowed vp / the vessell of corrupcyon

And all they semed in maner as frogges / both in their colours and facyons.
                     7 Idolatrye was that yll sprete whych first went out from the Serpent / & hath cōtynued euer sens in the worlde vnder the coloure of good workes / as pilgrimage / deuocyon / and laboure.
                     8 Erroure in abhominable fylthynesse was the sprete which came from the beastly Antichrist defilynge the whole christianite with innumerable supersticions vnder the coloure of chast lyuynge / in presthode / sacrifices / and ceremonyes.
                     9 Hypocrisye was the fowle sprete which yssewed from|the false preachers / poysoninge the catholyke faythe wyth false doctrine vnder the coloure of relygion / pretendinge abstinence / prayer / ād clennesse. These .iij. wycked spretes are not all vnlyke to the wylde fyre / smoke / 

and brymstone / which the terryble ferce horses euometed in the .ix. chapter of this present prophecye▪ For cursed / false / and vnpure they are. Their doctrine is wyckednesse / lyes / and deuylishnesse / ād the execrable wysdome of the fleshe. In maner of frogges are they here descrybed for their dyuersite of colours in ceremonyes / doctrynes / and sectes / for their filthye dwellynge in the dyrtye tradycions of menne / and for crookelynge of their vnknowne psalmodye and seruyce / dysquietynge wyth their idle customes the consciences of the simple multytude.
                     10 These are the verye spretes of deuyls / the ympes of Sathan workynge soche sygnes and myracles as wolde deceyue the verye chosen persons ād brynge them into erroure if it were so possible. But the lorde euermore defendeth his.

Of this wyll more be spoken in the .xix. chapter folowynge.

out the content of hys vyall into the ayre. For the seuenth age of the christen churche by the verye set purpose of God / are manye conuerted to the truthe / and become with Paule the vessels of eleccion / that afore were wyth Iudas the vessels of wrathe vnder the great aduersarye of God. Neyther is it anye blemishe vnto them to be called here that they were afore / vyals of wrathe / consyderynge that Simon leprosus / beynge ones healed of his leprosye was euer after called a leper. In case lyke / Paule after his conuersyon was not ashamed to report hym self both a Pharyse and also the sonne of a Pharyse.
                     2 These / by the myghtye determynacion of Gods stronge iudgement / are sent into the ayre. Most effectuallye are they lyghtened wyth the sprete of God / and prouoked stiflye to stande vp agaynst the aereall powers regnynge in the fyckle fantasticall Antychrystes and hypocrytes / condēpninge by Gods worde their vnyuersall doctrines and deuyllyshnesse. These powers are no lesse than deuyls / whō Christ calleth fowles of the ayre / Peter ā Iohā mannis aduersaryes / & saynt Paule the gouerners of the es

this place / the head with the tayle and the cause with his effecte / in these present significacyons shall no preiudyce be founde to that hath bene sayd in the other / though they seme verye dyuerse. For both the gouernours and also the landes / or the peples subiect vnto them haue vniuersallye bene blynded by their wylye toytchecraftes. And so haue the worldlye porentates wyth the spyrytuall Antychrystes agreed / that both they haue vsurped one malygnaūt medlynge ouer the sowles of menne to corrupt their faythe / the prynces applyenge their powers vnto the same. And that causeth the holye Ghost here to call them the beastes heades vnder the tytle of mountaynes and kynges. For vnder their princelye auctoritees hath all their myschefes bene fulfylled to vpholde this whoore agaynst Christ and his worde.
                     5 Fyue of these heades are fallen from the vnyuersall monarchye of Rome. All the dominyons of Affrica and Asia hath renounced the obedyence of her empyre. Onlye cleaueth Europa vnto her / which is the least of the thre / and yet not all therof. Whan the Papacye grewe / the whole empyre of the Grekes called Constantynople / fell cleane from the la

                        nes / and became with

other dyuerse monarchyes / the possession of Mahometes secte / or of the Agarenes and Turkes. Of the other empyres maye a lyke coniecture be had. Thus haue they declyned from her / not so goynge forth nor yet rysynge vp vnto Christ / for only is it sayd here / that they were fallen.
                     6 And one head is (sayth the text) at this present tyme remaynynge / the other head is not come as yet / but wyll come her after. This head remayninge is the sixt / and it is that feble empyre that Rome now holdeth / and haue holden sens Iohans tyme. The power of this empyre is ruynouslye demynyshed / and the notable fame therof decayed betwixt the Popyshe prelates and the Frenche menne / a great part of the landes becommynge Saynt Peters patrimonye. To make it a fytte head of the Beast to the vpholdynge of this whorishe churche (the auctoryte therof maynteyninge her lawes) Gregorye the fift Pope cō
                        mytted the emprours chosynge vnto .vi. princes of Germanye .iij. of them beynge Archebyshoppes. He appoynted also the kynge of Bohem for the seuenth / than beynge trybutarye vnto him and his owne feed man as an odde persons to waye vpon their sydes / yf nede / place / and tyme shuld requyre yt.

Prouyded alwayes that he shuld take his othe and receyue his crowne imperyall at Rome. So that now thowgh it styll be the same in tytle that it was in Iohans dayes / yet is it so dyuerse from it through dimynishment of power / and so vnlyke in outwarde magnifycence / as it neuer had bene the same.
                     7 The seuenth head that is not yet come / is the Papysticall kyngedome of owr Romyshe spiritualte. For therof apered nothynge in Iohans tyme / nor yet more than .v. hondreth years after it. The Byshoppes of Rome (as they call them) from Peter to Syluester / were verye poore sowles / symple creaturs / and menne not regarded but despysed of the worlde. They were no newe lawe makers for the more part / but rather they gaue their whole dilygence to se those lawes obserued / whom the holye ghost had made to their handes. Neyther were they anye Masse sayers / sowle syngers / or procession goers / but as was Saynt Paule with the other Apostles / symple preachers onlye / and for theyr syncere preachynge / they suffered the deathe of theyr bodyes. But after the Donacyon of Cōstantyne and other plentuouse almesses commytted vnto theyr handes for the socoure of the poore / they became all confessours / and toke them

to their ease at home. Than was laboure verye tedyouse vnto them / preachynge verye troblouse and peynefull. Than stodyed they all to please the powers / peceablye to holde styll their plesaunt possessions / and by spyrituall polycyes to increase them more and more / the poore in a maner forgottē. Then came in that holye ceremonye and that / with latten howres / seruynge of Sayntes / ād prayenge for the dead / to prouoke men to offer to Corban. Thus crept they vp in hypocrisye daye by daye / tyll soche tyme as Iohan of Constantinople contended with Gregorye of Rome for the supremyte. In the which contencion thowgh Gregorye layed for him self Saynt Peters keyes with manye other sore argumentes and reasons / yet was he commaunded by Mauricius the Emperour after the generall Synode / to obeye the sayd Iohan / as the vnyuersall head bisshop of the whole worlde. Than were these holye fathers compelled to tarrye a layser / and vnder craftye colours to wayte their praye. In processe of tyme whan Phocas was Emprour / Bonifacius the thirde a manne of a wylye practyse / perceyuynge him moche geuen to bayne glorye and couetousnesse / greatlye also to dissalowe the actes of Mauricius his predecessour / through flatterye

and mede obtayned of him that the churche of Rome shuld be holden from thens forth for the head churche of the worlde / ād he for the head byshop. Whā this was ones gotten / than rose they vp so hygh / that the Emprour became their fore stole / and all other chrysten princes their waytynge 
                           •
                        laues / to ryde and ronne / make and marre / stryue and fyght / slee and kyll / at their commaundement and pleasure. Thus became the Romyshe Pope the seuenth kynge / that was in Iohans tyme yet to come. If thu marke in the crouycles good reader / thu shalt fynde that Phocas the first Pope maker slewe his master the Emprour Mauricius / signifyenge in my sterye the sayd Pope makynge to be an vtter destruccyon to the empyre. The Popes name was also at that tyme Bonifacius / which is as moche to saye as bona facies / a good face. Which betokened that this newe raysed kyngedome shuld shewe a fayre face euermore / or a shynynge pretence of holynesse / what myschef so euer it wrought eyther agaynst God or manne in abhominable supersticyon.
                     8 And whan this seuenth kynge commeth (sayth the text) he must contynue a space / or abyde a lytle season. He must haue a tyme by the permyssion

of God / strongelye to delude the vnbeleuers / whych wyll neyther se nor heare / reade nor yet thankefullye receyue his worde of saluacyon / so gratyouslye offered them. So corrupt are the fleshelye affectes of menne / that moche more prone they are to lyes and supersticyons / than to the veryte of the lorde / which is to be lamented. Chryst came first in the name of his heauenlye father / but him wyll they not receyue. The Pope commeth in his owne wycked name / and to hym ronne they by heapes. Whose contynuaunce here hath bene but a tyme. For yet is it not a thowsande years sens the Papacye first beganne vnder Phocas / which is but as a daye before God / and that daye wyll he shorten by hys owne promes for hys electes sake / whych to remember is their great conforte. And a great cause whye. For sone after that shall they be fullye restored in to the perfyght nombre of the chyldren of God.
                     9 And the execrable beast (sayth the text) that of late dayes was in auctoryte ouer all the worlde / yea / syttinge aboue God in the conscyences of menne / and now is become of no reputacyon amonge menne (God openinge his myscheffes) is euen the eyght in nōbre.

And yet neuer the lesse is one of the .vij. heades. For both is he the beastlye bodye it self comprehendynge in him the vnyuersall abhominacyons of all the earthlye kyngedomes / and in that poynte dyuerse from the seuen heades / and so the .viij. in nombre.
                     10 And also he is one of the .vij. heades and the seuenth in nombre / in vsurpynge this proude worldlye kyngedome thus after a vayne temporall sort. Ouer & besides all this / maye he also be called the eyght in the cursed remnaunt which after the peceable sylence of christen lyberte (Sathan loosoned) shall most cruellye persecute Chrystes congregacyon a freshe / as in the .xx. chapter here folowynge wyll apere.
                     11 This Beast with his carryage / the Antichrist with his churche / or Sathan with his Sinagoge / shall not onlye go in to destruccyon here by the mightye breathe of Goddes mouthe / or the true preachinge of his Gospell / but also into dampnacyon euerlastinge in the ende of the worlde with the deuyll & his angels.

                     1 And the .x. hornes) sayth the Angell vnto Iohan) which thu sawest here vpon the heades of this rose coloured Beast / are in significacyon .x. kynges. Some hath taken these .x. kynges for all those Emprours of the larynes sens Charle mayne / which haue sworne them selues obedyent to the Bishop of Rome. Some haue thought them to be those prynces which here in Europa haue afore

tyme bene subiect to the Empyre of Rome. As the kynges of Englande / Fraunce / Spayne / Portyugale / Castele / Denmarke / Scotlande / Dngarye / Goheme / and Napels. But these considre not that they be yet more in nombre / as Aragone / Nauerre / Cycyle / Cypresse / Sardyne / Swethen / Pole / and soche other / and are all included in the seuen heades as members of the afore rehersed empyres. Neyther marke they that they are aboue the heades as hornes / ād more in nombre than the heades / betokenynge a rygorouse auctoryte and ferce power / which they proudelye vsurpe ouer them euerye where. Afore they were but suggestyons / but here are they ernest doers. For in euerye region hath the beastlye Antichrist of Rome his Metropolytanes and primates.

                     2 These had not yet at that tyme receyued the deuylyshe kyngedome of pestilent vsurpacyon ouer the sowles of menne. For though in Iohans dayes arose certen Antichristes / as Hebion / Cerinthus / Diotrephes / Carpocras / and so the lyke / yet were they nothing to these.
                     3 But now in dede they haue receyued the same self auctoryte and power with the Beast / that he toke afore of the Dragon / in maner of kynges to rewle in the hartes and consciences of menne to his behoue.
                     4 For so moche as their auctoryte is not of God lyke as is the auctorite of kynges / it is sayd here as kynges / or as menne counterfeatynge them / in vsurpynge a gouernaunce not frelye geuen them of God / but of the deuyll.
                     5 All at one houre receyued they thys auctoryte wyth the Beast. And that (I suppose) was in the generall counsell of Laterane at Rome / gathered vnder the tytle to recouer Hierusalem agayne.

                     9 For God hath (sayth the Angell) all blindenesse secluded / put it into the hartes of

those and soche other Godlye menne by the infusyon of his sprete / to fulfyll hys decreed will so pleasure in this behalf / as vtterlye to destroye the Popyshe relygyon or fylthye abhominacyons of Antichrist.
                     10 He hath geuen yt them more ouer to do these thynges to hys glorye / through the agrement of faythe that they haue in the vnyte of his Godlye truthe / to the abolyshment of all Sectes / false Prophetes / and coniurers of Egypte.
                     11 Fynallye by hys grace he hath moued them / through knowlege of his worde to rendre vp her blasphemouse kyngedome (whom sumtyme of ignoraunce they vsurped) vnto the malygnaunt Beast agayne / as the hornes of hys pestylēt heades. After this sort ded good Latimer and Shaxton geue ouer their Bysshop-ryckes / and so hath dyuerse other Godlye menne their promocyons and liuinges / as manye more yet here after wyll do.
                     12 For as they haue begonne so shall they contynue in demynyshynge the abhomynacyōs of this whoryshe churche / tyll the wordes and promyses of God by hys Apostles and Prophetes / which can neuer fayle / be whollye fulfilled in effect / and tyll hys last iudgement do fynyshe all. But thus do not all they which

haue done of the yoke of the Popes obedyence or blotted out hys name. For the greatter nombre of them retayneth styll the blasphemouse obseruacyons and Ceremonies of hys Romyshe relygyon / some makynge newe lawes of deathe for the establyshment of the same / as ys in Englande the acte of the .vi. Artycles with dyuerse other more. And for this remayneth here styll the Beast as receyuynge the rendred kyngedome of the whore. In whome ys also comprehended the wycked rēnaunt that shall worke the last myschefe / whome the lorde shall ende with hys seyd iudgement. This Beast ys not without hys lyuelye Image styll workynge the same feates that hymself wrought afore / though his head be greuouslye wounded in diuerse quarters of the worlde. Neyther ys he without craftye. Phesycyanes / to mynystre lyfe to the same. Who euer forswore the Pope more ernestlye / thā ded Stokyslaye and Sampson / Gardyne

But maruele not of the ordynaūce of the lorde / which all at one tyme prouyded Moyses to gyde his peple and yet hardened Pharao agaynst them

which sent his sonne Iesus Christ to saue them / and yet suffred the Prestes to murther hym / cōsideringe he ys that potter which maketh both the vessels of honoure and dishonoure.
                     13 Breuelye to conclude the whole of this matter (sayth the Angell) the gorgyouse aparcled womā / or glytteringe churche of ātichrist / which thu sawest here of late in misterye / ys also in resemblaunce the great cyte Babylon / the mother of all the spirituall abhominacyons and Idolatryes done vpon the earthe. For lyke as from Syon hath the lawe commē forth and the worde of God from Hierusalem / so hath yssewed forth from this Babylonyshe Rome soche a false Relygyon into Emprours / princes / and peples / as with fylthyr superstycyons hath poysoned all the worlde.
                     14 For a kyngedom she hath ouer the kynges or noble gouernours of the earthe / a false power / a vsurped auctoryte / and a seate of verye pestylence. Alas for pytye that so worthye potentates shuld be in subieccyon to so slynkynge an whore / to so vyle an harlott / beynge so the seruauntes of synne and captyue slaues to all wyckednesse / from the which the lorde ones delyuer them. Amen.
