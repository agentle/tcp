               LONDON,
Printed by Edw. Griffin, for
Samuel Man, dwelling in
Pauls Church-yard at the ſigne
of the Swan, 1620.
         
         
            
            
            To the Chriſtian Reader.
            
               THe condition of
euery true ſeruant
of God in
this world, is fitly compared
to a warfare,Iob. 7. 1. and
his life to the life of a
ſouldier,Eſa. 40. 2. in reſpect of
the many,Num. 4. 43. the mighty,1. Tim. 2. 4.
the malicious and ſubtle
enemies hee is to
deale withall.Iam. 4. 2. This is
true, eſpecially of ſuch

as ſerue God in the
worke of the miniſterie,
who haue not ſlite
to wraſtle againſt principalities
and againſt
powers, that is, againſt
wicked ſpirits, euen the
diuell and his Angels,
and againſt their owne
luſts, which fight in
their members (which
too are common, with
them and all other
Chriſtians) but alſo
(and that in a ſpeciall
manner) Againſt vnreaſonable
and euill men.
               2 Theſ 3. 2.
            
            Hereof the holy men
of God haue had experience

in all ages in the
world.Inde 14, 15 
               Enock the ſeauenth
from Adam, wraſtled
with ſuch, as may
appeare by his holy
propheſie, of the ſecond
cōming of Ieſus Chriſt,
whereby he doth comfort
himſelf and others
againſt them. Noah al
ſo, who liued likewiſe
before the floud, did
contend & ſtriue with
ſuch, (as a man that
goeth to law with another)
120. yeares together,
as Moſes ſheweth
in the 6. of Gen.Gen. 6. 3.
            
            Who knoweth not

the manifold and continuall
Combats that
Moſes that great Prophet,Pſa. 95. 10. and meek ſeruant
of God,Exo. 14. 11. 12. & 15. 24. (an alſo his brother
Aaron) had with a
mutinous & vnthankfull
people 40.Num. 11. & 14. & 16. & 20. &. 21. yeares
long in the wilderneſſe?
This ſtory is ſo clearely
recorded, ſo plainely
and plentifull ſet down
in the bookes of Exod.
and Numb. and ſo well
knowne to euery Chriſtian,
that I ſhall not
neede to quote any places
for the proofe hereof.
            
               
               Eſay (as the Lords
Meſſenger) complaineth,Rom. 10. 21.
ſaying, All the day
long haue I ſtretched out my
hand, to a diſobedient and
gaineſaying people. And
Ieremie cryeth mainely
out:Ier. 15. 10. 
               Woe is me my mother,
that thou haſt borne mee a
contentious man, and a man
that ſtriueth with the whole
land. Doth not the
ſpeech of the Lord to
the Prophet Ezechiel
teach vs the ſame thing,
where he ſaith;Ezech. 2. 3. 6 
               Sonne of
man, I ſend thee to the children
of Iſrael, a rebellious
houſe. And a little after,

he telleth him, that Rebels
and thornes ſhall bee
with him, and that hee ſhall
remaine among ſcorpions.
What ſhall I ſay more?
For this Epiſtle would
be ouer long, if I ſhould
ſpeake of our Sauiour
Chriſt, who in the daies
of his fleſh, and after,Luc 2 34.
was,Math. 22. & 23. 
               a ſigne that was ſpoken
againſt,
               Act. 
                     •
                  61 
                     •
                  2. & 19 28 & 21. 28. as the manifold
oppoſitions and
combats, which hee
had with the Iewiſh
Prieſts do ſhew; or of
his Apoſtles, who (as
Paul ſpeaketh of himſelfe)
fought with men,

as mad and furious as
any wilde beaſtes.
            Wherefore to omit
other teſtimonies and
examples that might be
alledged for proofe of
this point, let vs only
inſiſt a little vpon that
example, which is ſet
before vs in this preſent
text of Scripture, wherin
we haue (as it were)
a Monomachie, or ſingle
combat betwixt the
Prophet Samuel, and
Saul a King, whom hee
himſelfe (by the commandement
of God)
had anoynted.
            
               
Now, whereas vnreaſonable
and euill
men are of two ſorts,
ſome fierce and cruell,
as Dogs & Lyons, that
will turne again, & rent
ſuch as reproue them,
as the Sodomites,Gen. 19. 9. and
Ieroboam:
               1 Kin. 13. 4. others, ſubtill
and crafty, as Serpents
and Foxes, full of ſhifts
and faire pretences. Samuel
in this place, hath
to deale with the latter.
For hee hath to
deale with Saul, who
hauing (for the time)
layd aſide his Lyon-like
diſpoſition, wherewith

hee rored againſt his eldeſt
ſon Ionathan,
               1 Sam. 20. 30, 31▪
                doth
now fall (like his father,
the firſt Adam) to ſly and
ſhameles ſhifting,Gen. 3. with
Samuel the faithfull ſeruant
of God.
            For firſt of all (putting
on a brow of
braſſe,Verſ. 13. 10. 12. and a fore-head
of iron) hee telleth Samuel,
by way of preuention,
and againſt the
light of his owne conſcience,Verſ. 15.
that he had fulfilled
the commandement
of the Lord. Secondly,
being put from
that ſtarting hole, and

plainely conuinced of
a flat vntruth, hee ſhifteth
it off from himſelfe
to the people; whom
yet hee iuſtfieth, in reſpect
of their end and
good intent, which was
(as he ſaith) to do ſacrifice
to the Lord their
God.Verſ. 20. 21. Thirdly, being
further conuinced of
his ſin, and the root of
it (that is, greedy auarice)
being layd open,
hee hardneth his heart
yet more, and with an
impudent face doth iuſtifie,
both himſelfe and
the people, as thinking

it great pity, to kill ſuch
a goodly Prince as Agag
was, and to ſpoyle and
caſt away ſuch fat cattle,
and make them a
prey for the fowles and
wilde beaſts, which
might ſerue for better
purpoſes; thus ſecretly
taxing the commandement
of the Lord, of
too much rigor and ſeuerity,
& making himſelfe
more wiſe & merciful
then God.Verſ. 24. 25. Fourthly,
being driuen from
this hold, and ſo manifeſtly
conuinced, that
he could not deny it to

be a ſin; yet he ſeeketh
to extenuate and excuſe
it, as a ſin of infirmity,
which hee committed
not in contempt of
God;Exod. 32. 32. but for feare of
the people, which thing
alſo mooued Aaron to
make the molten Calfe.Verſe 30.
Laſtly, being brought
by maine force, to acknowledge
that his ſin
could not bee cloked,
nor excuſed, hee doth
not goe about to ſeeke
reconciliation, & make
his peace with God; but
all his care is, to maintaine
his honor, and to

keep his credit with the
people.
            To conclude, I conſider
in this Treatiſe
two things: whereof
the firſt is the matter &
ſubject thereof; the ſecond,
the ſpeech and
manner of handling. In
regard of the former,
it may bee called, The
vncaſing, or diſcouering
of an Hypocrite:
In regard of the latter,
it may be called (according
to the phraſe of
the Apoſtle.2. Tim. 1. 13) A true
type and patterne of
wholſome ſpeeches or

words. The firſt is a fit
ſubiect for euery faithfull
Miniſter of Gods
holy Word, to labour
often in: and the other,
a liuely example of diuiding
the Word of God a
right,
               2. Tim. 2. 15 opening and applying
of it with that
wiſdome, plainneſſe,
ſimplicity, and power,
which will preuaile
more with thoſe that
truely feare God, then
all the painted eloquence
and oſtentation
of human wiſdom,
that the wit of man can
poſſibly ſhew. To ſuch,

I commend the reading
and hearing of theſe
godly Sermons, beſeeching
God to adde his
gracious bleſſing thereunto,

               1. SAMVEL: CHAP. 15. VER. 13, &c.
               13. AND Samuel came
to Saul, and Saul
ſaid vnto him,
Bleſſed be thou of the LORD:
I haue performed the commandement
of the LORD.
               
               14. And Samuel ſaide,
what meaneth then this bleating
of the ſheep in mine eares,
and the lowing of the Oxen
which I heare?
               15. And Saul ſaid, they
haue brought them from the
Amalekites: for the people ſpared
the beſt of the ſheepe, and

of the oxen, to ſacrifice vnto
the LORD thy God, and the
reſt wee haue vtterly deſtroyed.
               
               16. Then Samuel ſaid vnto
Saul, Stay, and I will tell
thee what the LORD hath
ſaid to me this night. And hee
ſaid vnto him, Say on.
               
               17. And Samuel ſaide.
When thou waſt little in thine
owne ſight, waſt thou not made
the Head of the Tribes of Iſrael,
and the LORD anointed
thee king ouer Iſrael?
               
               18. And the LORD ſent
thee on a iourney, and ſaid, Goe,
and vtterly deſtroy the ſinners
the Amalekites, and fight againſt
them, vntill they be conſumed.
               
               19. Wherefore then didſt
thou not obey the voice of the
LORD, but didſt flie vpon the

ſpoyle, and didſt euill in the
ſight of the LORD?
               20. And Saul ſaide vnto
Samuel; Yea, I haue obeyed
the voice of the LORD, and
haue gone the way which the
LORD ſent mee, and haue
brought Agag the King of Amaleck,
and haue vtterly deſtroyed
the Amalekites.
               
               21. But the people tooke of
the ſpoyle, ſheepe and oxen, the
chiefe of the things which
ſhould haue beene vtterly deſtroyed,
to ſacrifice vnto the
LORD thy God in Gilgal.
               
               22. And Samuel ſaid, hath
the LORD as great delight in
burnt offerings and ſacrifices,
as in obeying the voice of the
LORD? Behold, to obey is better
then ſacrifice: and to hearken,
then the fat of Rammes.
               
               23. For rebellion is as the

ſinne of witchcraft, and ſtubborneneſse
is as iniquity and idolatry:
becauſe thou haſt reiected
the stord of the LORD,
he hath alſo reiected thee from
being King.
               
               24. ¶And Saul ſaid vnto
Samuel, I haue ſinned: for I
haue tranſgreſſed the comman
dement of the LORD, and thy
words; becauſe I feared the
people and obeyed their voice.
               
               25 Now therefore I pray
thee, pardon my ſinne, and
turne againe with mee that I
may worſhip the LORD.
               26 And Samuel ſaid vnto
Saul, I will not returne with
thee: for thou haſt reiected the
word of the LORD, and the
LORD hath reiected thee from
being King ouer Iſrael.
               
               27 And as Samuel turned
about to goe away, he layd hold

vpon the skirt of his mantle,
and it rent.
               
               28. And Samuel ſaid vnto
him, The LORD hath rent
the kingdome of Iſrael from
thee this day, and hath giuen it
vnto a neighbour of thine, that
is better then thou.
               
               29. And alſo the ſtrength
of Iſrael will not lie, nor repent:
for he is not a man that
he ſhould repent.
            
         
      
      
         
            
            
            SAMVELS
Encounter with
SAVL.
            
               THE occaſion
of theſe words
was this. The
Lord commanded
King
Saul by Samuel the Prophet,
that hee ſhould goe and deſtroy
the Amalekites, all,
both man and beaſt, and
leaue none of them aliue.
Touching the cauſe (ſeeing

it were too long to ſet
downe) I referre the Reader
to Deut. 25. 18. Saul went
about this worke of the
Lord very ſpeedily at the
firſt, as appeareth in verſes
3. 4. 5. but (as it is commonly
ſeene, that men are not ſo
forward and feruent in good
attempts vnto the end of
them, as they are hot in the
beginning) ſo it was with
him: for afterwards, when
he had taken the King, hee
ſhewed kindneſſe and clemency
towards him, contrary
to the expreſſe charge
and commandement of the
Lord, and ſpared the beſt of
the Cattell, and deſtroyed
them not. For the which the
Lord was ſore diſpleaſed,
ſeeing he had ſerued him by
halfes, and done his buſines

negligently.Ieremy 48. 10. God declared
to Samuel how greatly Saul
had offended him: Samuel
was exceedingly grieued for
him, and cryed to the Lord
all night to pacifie him. In
the morning he roſe early to
ſeeke Saul, that he might by
pittying his eſtate, moue him
to pitty himſelfe, and whiles
the offence was yet but newly
wrought, hee might bewaile
it, and intreate the
the Lord againſt it and repent,
not hardning his heart.
This was the occaſion of
theſe words.
            The Text followes from
the 13. verſe. Firſt Samuel
found Saul glorying in his
Triumph ouer the Amalekites,The meaning of the whole cō
                  text, from Verſ. 13. to Verſ 30.
and farre from any
thought that hee had done
any euill that hee ought to

repent of, inſomuch that at
his meeting of Samuel hee
preuented him, and beganne
to iuſtifie himſelfe, as though
he had done well, before Samuel
could tell him how
greatly his offence diſpleaſed
the Lord. Samuel hearing
him thus to ſpeake, was
holden and hindred, from
telling him what God ſaid to
him of Saul, for the which
end hee came to him; and
therefore is cauſed firſt to
conuince him, that hee had
broken Gods commaundement,
becauſe hee heard the
bleating of the ſheepe, and
the lowing of the Oxen,
which hee had ſaued aliue,
and brought from the Amalakites.
Saul firſt excuſeth
the matter by ſhifting, and
not ſaying any thing directly.

Then Samuel bad him
hearken what God had ſaid
of him the night before. And
he, nothing fearing (though
it is manifeſt that hee had
cauſe) boldly bad Samuel
ſay his minde, as though all
had beene well on his ſide.
Then hee told him, ſpeaking
from the Lord, that hee
brought him from a low eſtate
to be a King, yet when
hee ſent him to deſtroy his enemies,
the Amalekites, hee
obeyed him not, but did
what he thought good. But
Saul bluſhed not a whit for
al this, but waſhed his words
away, freeing himſelfe from
blame, and the fault that was,
he laid on the people, that
they indeede ſaued ſome of
the cattle aliue, but the matter
was ſmall (hee ſaid) for

they did it to offer them to
the Lord in ſacrifice. This
anſwere Samuel ſhewed to
be weake: for what (ſaid he)
did God account of thy ſacrifice,
in compariſon of obeying
him? But as ſmall a
fault as thou holdſt it, I can
tell thee, it will coſt thee thy
kingdome. At that word,
when he heard of loſing his
kingdome, he was much moued.
For we ſee for all his iuſtifying
of himſelfe, and bold
deſending of his innocency,
yet this wrung from him a
confeſſion of his fault, inſomuch
that he ſaid the cleane
contrary, that he had ſinned
and ſought pardon; and deſired
Samuel to returne with
him to worſhip God, but he
would not, but confirmed to
him, that God had taken his

kingdome from him: yet afterward
Samuell conſidering
that Agag was yet aliue, he
followed Saul, who worſhipped
God, but Samuell
did not accompany him
therein, but called for Agag,
and ſlue him: and after that,
Saul and he, parted each to
his owne houſe, and Samuell
went no more to Saul, to the
day of his death: (it is like
that he ſaw there was no end
thereof, neither any good
like to come thereby) but
much lamented his eſtate,
being deſperate. And this
for a view and ſhort ſumme
of the text in hand.
            I proceed now to the deuiſion
of the words: whereof
there are three parts.
            The firſt containeth the
cōmunication betwixt Saul
               
and Samuell, before the meſſage
was deliuered, in the
firſt three verſes.
            
                The ſecond is a part of the
meſſage, and Sauls anſwere
before hee confeſſed any
fault, to verſe 24.
            
                The third part conteines
the other part of the meſſage
after Sauls confeſſion, vnto
verſe 19. and ſuch other
things as follow towardes
the end of the Chapter.
            Euery part I will handle
thus. Firſt in ſome generall
manner I will ſhew the meaning
thereof, and afterwards
ſpeake more particularly of
the matter, by ſetting downe
the doctrine and the vſe. For
the firſt.The particular opening of the firſt part. When Samuell had
found Saule, and was readie
to tell him what the Lord
had ſaid to him that verie

night before, Saul preuents
him (as I ſaid) and tels him
how hee had executed the
charge which he had receiued
of the Lord, concerning
the deſtroying of the Amalakites,
when it was nothing
ſo, but manifeſt and cleare,
that he had very negligently
and ſlightly diſcharged it.
Then Samuell was ſtayed,
from telling him what the
Lord had ſaid to him, and
was driuen to anſwere him
to his ſo groſſe iuſtifying and
commending of himſelfe,
and to conuince him of vntruth
as he did, ſaying, if thou
haſt faithfully executed the
Lords Commaundement,
then thou haſt deſtroyed and
killed all that perteined to
Amaleck, but that thou haſt
not done, for I heare the

bleating of the ſheepe, and
the lowing of the Oxen,
which thou haſt brought
from thence, ſpared and ſaued
aliue, therefore thou haſt
not fulfilled the Commaundement
of the Lord.
            
               Saul then being thus conuicted
by Samuell, when he
muſt either haue confeſſed
himſelfe guiltie, and haue
craued pardon (a man would
thinke) or elſe defend and
proue his ſpeech to be true,
did neither of both, but ſhifted
and waſhed off the Prophets
conuiction, ſaying,
that he for his part, as the
Lord had commanded, had
ſlaine the Amalekites, and
the meaneſt of the Cattell:
indeed the people had ſaued
ſome of the beſt of them, but
yet euen that (he ſaid) was

for the worſhip of the Lord,
to offer in ſacrifice to him,
which he thought was not to
be found fault with. Thus he
ſalueth vp the ſore (though
the plaiſter was too narrow)
attributing that which was
well done, (as the killing of
the worſt of the Cattell) to
himſelfe, the other (if it were
a fault to ſaue ſome aliue,
which he did not thinke) he
ſaid was the peoples fault,
and none of his. And this be
ſpoken, for laying out the
meaning of theſe three verſes,
which conteine the firſt
cōmunication betwixt Saul
and Samuell, after God was
offended with Saul for his
halfe ſeruing of him, when
he ſhould haue done the
whole, as he was commaunded.

                  VERS. 13.
                  
                     And Samuell came to Saul,
and Saul ſaid vnto him, Bleſſed
be thou of the LORD:
I haue performed the Commandement
of the LORD.
               
               
                  The ground of the firſt doctrine.
                  NOw to begin with Saul
(with whom we heard
the Lord was ſore diſpleaſed,
and therefore Samuell
came to him in tender compaſſion
and loue, ſeeing the
plague neare him, to counſel
him to auoyd it by meeting
the Lord with true Repentance)
he was ſo farre off,
from looking for, or hearing
any rebuke from him, that
before Samuell could ſpeake
to him he preuented him,
but how? not by confeſſing
his ſinne and accuſing him

ſelfe for his ſlight and negligent
executing of the Lord
his charge committed vnto
him, which he had iuſt cauſe
to haue done, before the Prophet
came vnto him, and
much more, when he ſaw he
was comming: but by iuſtifying
himſelfe boldly in the
euill he had done, ſaying,
that he had obeyed the Lord
his Commandement, euen
then, when the prophet came
to tell him of, and reproue
him for the contrary; and
who doth not ſee that hee
ſhewed himſelfe thereby to
be farre from the grace that
became him to haue, & that
was in the Theſſalonians,
                     2. Theſ. 3. 4. of
whom Paul ſaid, he was perſwaded
before he wrote, that
they were readie to do whatſoeuer
he ſhould require of

them. Saul I ſay was farre
from that grace, (for elſe he
ſhould haue feared and relented
for that which he had
done)
               
               
                  And thereby we may ſee
what little place there is for
reproofes & reprehenſions,
among Chriſtians (ſuch a
one as Saul was) though
there be neuer ſo iuſt cauſe
giuen thereof; and how men
harneſſe & arme themſelues
againſt the ſame, by preuenting
them, and by defending
and iuſtifying that in themſelues,
which is vile and
naught: yea, and they will
haue them, whoſe office it is
to tell them of their faults,
to know and thinke that they
are as well reformed, as the
beſt reformers themſelues;
and when all that liue with

them ſee their liues full of
diſorder, yet not onely they
will acknowledge no ſuch
thing, but contrarily they
boldly beare out all, and defend
their own doings. True
it is, they will not ſay they
doe wickedly and that they
will doe ſo ſtill (for then it
might bee hoped that they
might be made aſhamed of
ſo great boldneſſe) but they
doe worſe, for they call euill
good, and ſo being wiſe
in their owne conceite, they
ſhew that there is more hope
of a foole, then of them,
Pro. 26. The beſt men and
moſt approued ſeruants of
God that we read of, how
good ſoeuer they were, yet
in the time wherein they liued,
would ordinarily and
daily humble and caſt down

themſelues before God, becauſe
they were ſinners, and
ſay, Lord, if thou looke
ſtraightly what is done amiſſe,
who ſhal be able to abide
it? Pſal. 130. And our
Sauiour hath taught his, that
when they haue done God
the beſt ſeruice, yet that they
ſhould count themſelues but
vnprofitable ſeruants, Luke
17. 10. If the beſt be but vnprofitable,
and that God
may iuſtly challenge them;
who ſeeth not that they are
farre of from a good eſtate
and condition, who bluſh
not for the manifold ſinnes
which they are priuie to in
ſecret, and which men are
able to bring againſt them openly?
And yet as fearefull
a condition as this is, to this
point multitudes are come

in this our age, that as ſome
are growne ſo ſeared and
hardned, that they will not
at all come to the light, leaſt
their euill deedes ſhould be
made knowne, Ioh. 3: So
many other ſo handle the
matter, that whatſoeuer reproofes
they heare, that doe
moſt concerne them, they
will admit none, but hate to
be reformed, becauſe they
loue darkneſſe more then
light, and with the Adder
ſtop their eares at the voice
of the charmer, charme he
neuer ſo wiſely. And as they
ſhift off reproofes in the
publick place after this manner,
ſo they haue learned as
cunningly to deceiue themſelues
in priuate. For as this
age affordeth not many,
who are ſo careful to liue innocently

in their owne life,
that they may be bold to tell
others of their faults, ſo they,
which are ſuch that they
dare rebuke a mortall man,
for taking away honor from
the immortall God, they are
knowne well enough,Men are ſhy of ſuch as will reproue. and
noted for the moſt part: and
they who are faultie and offenſiue
in their liues, will be
wary enough how they
come into their companies;
eſpecially they will be ſure
to haue no familiaritie with
them, that ſo they may be
free from their reprehenſions,
counting ſuch no better
then mad men, 2. King. 9. 11.

when they were yet but
weake, hearing their maſter
cōplaining, that one of them
ſhould betray him, could not
be quiet nor ſatisfied, vntill
they might be reſolued,
which of them was the offender,
and therefore ſaid
one after another, Maſter is
it I, is it I? But how many
on the contrary, are ſo far off
from this readineſſe to heare
of their ſinnes, that if in publique
preaching they heare
any thing to ſound that way,
and to come neare them,
they deadly diſlike it: neither
doth any thing make their
liues more pleaſant, and better
liking to them, then in
their deepeſt ſecuritie, to be
without reprehenſions: nor
nothing more ſting & vexe
them, then when they are

conſtrained to heare iuſt rebukes.
So farre are they off,
from reprouing themſelues
ſecretly, as (if one ſhould
marke it, or could know
what they doe) that hee
ſhould not heare one of
many to ſay,ler. 8. 6. Yet reprouers muſt be cautelous. 
                     what haue I
done? I graunt that reproofes
muſt be kindly, not arrogantly
miniſtred, that it may beſeeme
the reprouers. They
therefore haue great grace,
who haue learned and are reſolued,
to heare and admit
the words of exhortation,
& to be ſubiect to reproofes
with willingneſſe, that they
may be kept from euill. But
(Lord) how many haue turned
away from receiuing admonition
and correction, till
with the foole in the Prou. 5.

                           ••

                        . 
                     I was almoſt brought

to euill for it. And this be
ſaid by occaſion of Sauls
preuenting the Prophets rebuke.
               
            
            
               Doct. 2. No mans way is euil in his own eyes.
               We may further gather
here by this, that Saul could
make an euill matter, ſeeme
ſo good as hee made his
ſeeme to be, that if euery
man may be allowed to tell
his owne tale, the worſt perſon
will ſeeme honeſt, and
the baddeſt caſe appeare to
be good. For why? men can
ſo paint and diſguiſe themſelues,
that they wil nothing
ſhew themſelues to be ſuch
as indeed they are, but farre
better and more gracious.
For when God himſelfe bewrayeth
and ſetteth out here
Saul to Samuell, to be ſo euill
that he repented that he had
made him king 
                     •
                   yet doth

he at the firſt greeting and
meeting of Samuell, ſo commends,
and magnifies his
owne doings vnto him, that
he freed himſelfe from all
blame: ſo that no man, vnleſſe
taught of God, would
once haue thought, that he
had beene faultie and worthie
to be reproued, to the
which end yet Samuell came
vnto him: like Gehazai, who
when he had by ſhameleſſe
lying inriched himſelfe, and
deſerued no more to remain
in his place; yet appeared before
his maſter boldly, as if
he had done no ſuch thing,
& being asked from whence
he came (which might ſecretly
haue made him appaled,
knowing himſelfe guitie) yet
bluſhed not a whit, but anſwered,2 Kin. 5. 25
ſaying, thy ſeruant

proofe as he had, that a man
ſhould heare both parties:
and that, who ſo giueth ſentence
in a matter when hee
hath heard but the one, it
ſhall be a ſhame vnto him
when the other ſhall come
forth to be heard.
               
                  
Nay, to come to matters
which doe more nearly concerne
the Lord; how many

conſcience, when they

in their whole courſe:
& from pride and ſelfe loue,
that they like,Note. & would haue

Which cauſeth that complaint
in Prou. 20.Pro. 20. 6. 
                  The greateſt
part will boaſt euery one of
his owne goodneſſe, but where
ſhall one find a faithfull man?
I graunt that ſuch euill men
are found out and diſcerned
of the godly, where they
liue, and to ſuch they can do
the leſſe harme by their ill
example, ſeeing they be contrary
minded vnto them: as
Salomon ſayth of one kinde

of ſuch, The rich man is wiſe
in his owne conceite, but the
poore that hath vnderſtanding,
can finde him out. But great
offence theſe giue to ſuch as
are ſtrangers to them, who,
when they heare them ſpeak
well, and after vnderſtand
that their deedes are contrary,
doe cauſe them to crie
out againſt ſuch: and ſeeing
they perceiue them to bee
profeſſors of the Goſpell,
they are ſet much further off
from embracing it: but on
the other ſide, they honour
both God and Goſpell who
are faithfull, and men of
their word.
               
                  Vſe.
                  The vſes of this doctrine
be many.  Firſt, that we bee
not partiall in our owne
matters.  Secondly, that wee
be not to haſty to commend

and allow of all ſuch as can
giue a good ſhew of godlineſſe
and honeſtie, but as we
ſhall haue better proofe
thereof.  Thirdly, that our
owne ſpeeches bee few, but
as they come from an vpright
and a well ordered
heart: for, in many words
there is much ſinne,
                     Pro. 25. and only
a word in ſeaſon is like apples
of gold, and pictures of ſiluer.
Fourthly, that wee make 
much of ſuch, of whoſe
faithfulneſſe wee haue good
proofes there being ſo few of
them. And fiftly, be we helpers 
to them, in whom wee
ſee good ſignes of well meaning,
and of whom we haue
good hope.
               
            
            
               Doct. 3. They that be bad, wil ſometime reuerence the Miniſters.
               Thus haue we ſeene Saul
his ſhameles iuſtifying himſelfe,
wherein hee was moſt

guilty. And yet as much
vnbeſeeming as this ſpeech
of Saul was, hee is in one
thing to be preferred before
many of our time. For
whereas many, not onely refuſe
to bee guided by the inſtruction
and doctrine of
their teachers, but alſo deſpiſe
them in their hearts, as
Ahab did Michaiah. 1 King.
22. 8. and count them their
vtter enemies, for telling them
of the truth, as ſome of the
Galathians did Paul Cap. 4.
yea, fall vpon them cruelly,
as Saul himſelfe did afterward
(when he grew notorious
and farre worſe then
here hee ſeemed to bee) yet
was hee not yet ſo exaſperated
againſt the Prophet
(though hee were the man
that had before ſharpely rebuked

him) but that he gaue
him a reuerend title, as the
bleſſed of the Lord, 1. Sam. 13.
13. and therefore thought
him an happy man, though
hee himſelfe could not ſeeke
and embrace, the ſame loue
and fauour of the Lord that
he did. I doe not ſo much
note this, to aſcribe any
thing to Saul, whom the holy
Ghoſt condemneth, as to
bewray too many profeſſors
of our time,They that come not thus farre, are farre off. eſpecially the
mighty and wealthy, though
in degree and place, farre vnder
him: who are not content
to caſt behinde their
backs, the worthy admonitions,
exhortations and leſſons
of thoſe meſſengers of
God, which are ſent vnto
them (if at any time they
will heare any of them) but

hate and bite, yea and alſo
rend them (as wee ſay with
their teeth) who are reuerend
men of God: which doth
ſhew that there is another
manner of ſpirit in them
(that is more poyſonfull)
then that which was in Saul.
For hee that beareth reuerence
to the meſſengers,
though hee obey not their
meſſage, is to be hoped of in
many reſpects, more then he
which contemnes them in
his heart, whether he bewray
the ſame by malicious
words, and a fiery face, or
whether hee counterfeit better
things to them by gloſing
ſpeech and diſſembling
countenance. And therefore
to what a fearefull point are
our daies come, wherein the
Miniſtery, which is Gods ordinance

for the ſaluation and
happineſſe of the people, is
in ſuch contempt? and that
not with a few, but almoſt vniuerſally,
that the moſt are
ſo farre off from receiuing
their Miniſters, as the Augels
of God for their meſſage
ſake, that they are vile in
their eyes, and of all people
may beſt be ſpared of them.
Neither offer they this meaſure
to the idle, ignorant,
proud and vnprofitable,
who if they are ſuch, as they
deeme them (their office ſet
apart) are iuſtly ſo dealt with
by Gods righteous iudgements
(that ſeeing they diſhonour
him, he leaues them
without honour,1. Sam. 2. and ſeeing
their lips refuſe knowledge, he
refuſeth them for being his)
but they offer this meaſure

euen to ſuch, as in tender care
of their good, beſeech them as
the Lords Ambaſſadours, in the
name of Chriſt,
                  2. Cor. 5. 
                  to be reconciled
vnto God (whom to reiect, is
to reiect the Lord himſelfe)
yet theſe bee ſcorned by the
name of Prieſts, for in ſuch
ſence they vſe that tearme,
that when the perſons be in
diſgrace with them, they
may the eaſilyer deſpiſe their
doctrine, not conſidering
the waighty charge of the
Lord, who ſaith,1. Theſ. 5. 
                  deſpiſe not
Prophecying, and againe, touch
not mine anointed and doe my
Prophets no harme. Of whom
this will I ſay, that if they
who heare the word, yea,
and that with ſome ioy, and
giue reuerence to the Meſſengers,
as Saul here did, and
Herod to Iohn Baptiſt, yet not

receiuing their doctrine and
meſſage, to reforme and
keepe them from euill, ſhall
periſh euerlaſtingly; that
much greater damnation abideth
for theſe, and they
beare the marke of it already
Heb. 2. 2. & cap. 10. 29. For
ſuch contempt is an infallible
token of it, ſo long as it
ſhall bee found in them:
which I doe not ſay as
though they were in caſe
good enough, vnleſſe they
deſire to be reformed alſo.
            
            
               Doct. 4. Gods Miniſter muſt conuict his hearers of the truth he vtters.
               
               
                  VERS. 14.
                  
                     And Samuel ſaid, What meaneth
then this bleating of
the ſheepe in mine eares, and
the louing of the oxen which
I heare?
                  
               
               IT followeth; Though
Samuel came to tell Saul,
how God was diſpleaſed
with him for his ſinne before
mentioned, yet when he
ſaw how hee iuſtified himſelfe,
affirming that hee had
obeyed him, he ſtayed for a
better opportunity afterwards,
and now anſwered
his vntrue, bold, and vnſeaſonable
commending of his
act done to the Amalakites:
and therefore as hee offered
him fit occaſion, ſo he tooke
it, and conuicted him, and

proued by cleere euidence againſt
him, that he groſly deceiued
himſelfe. Thus: If
thou haſt obeyed the commandement
of the Lord,
ſaying, Why haſt thou not
then deſtroyed all, both men
and cattell? But haſt reſerued
ſome of them: For I
heare the lowing of the oxen
and the bleating of the
ſheepe, which thou haſt
brought away with thee
from thence for a pray.
Therefore thou haſt not obeyed
the commandement
of the Lord. Thus he proued,
that hee was guilty,
wherein hee boaſted of his
great obedience. Now this
wiſe kinde of dealing, and
carefull, the miniſters of God

faults and ſinnes vnto
them, that they may haue no
excuſe for their lying ſtill in
them.Reaſons why. For the people being
blinde, and full of ſelfe-loue,
do readily flatter themſelues
in their ſinnes, and are ſlow
to come to the examination
of them: and therefore if
they bee not rouſed vp and
made to ſee them as farre as
they haue giuen cauſe, by
prouing to their conſciences,
and conuincing them that
they are guilty, they accuſe
not themſelues, but goe forward
in their ſinnes. And
therefore Saint Paul, among
all his graue and waighty
exhortations to Timothie about
preaching, chargeth
him to conuince the offenders,2. Tim. 4.
that they bee not able
to gainſay him: as being priuy

in themſelues, that they
are iuſtly found fault with.
And that is moſt likely, if any
outward meanes will doe
good, namely to controle
the conſcience, and to cauſe
thoſe who are guiltie, to ſee
and acknowledge their ſins:
The which effect euery reproofe
is not like to worke.
Therefore our Sauiour hearing
many reproofes by the
Pharaſies, but all of them
vniuſt, asketh them which of
them is able to conuince him of
ſinne?
                  Io. 8. 46. as if he ſhould ſay, if
ye can conuict me, I haue
nothing to defend my ſelfe
by. And their manner of
teaching and priuate ſpeaking
did he himſelfe vſe: for
which cauſe alſo it is ſaid,
that he taught them with authoritie,
which they could not

reſiſt,
                  Math. 7. and with power, vrging
their conſciences, and not
coldly and deadly as the
Scribes:Act. 7. So did Stephen alſo
conuict the rebellious Iewes,
with ſuch power as they could
not reſiſt. And this manner
of dealing with the people,
ſhall through Gods bleſſing,
preuaile with many and doe
much good: but otherwiſe,
if they be taught but generally
(though I would to
God there were that done
ſoundly and in plainnes)
they will eaſily winde out,
from ſeeing any great matter
amiſſe in themſelues, and ſo
lying ſtill in their ſinnes, they
ſhall the leſſe ſee what they
are indebted to God, and
not haue the ſcriptures in
that reuerence and account,
that otherwiſe they ſhould.
               
                  
                  
                     Obiect. 
                   And as for that ſome obiect,
doth this manner of
dealing preuaile with all?
               
                  
                     Anſw. 
                   I anſwere it is moſt likely,
of all other to doe good, ſeeing
it is that, which the ſcripture
requireth to be vſed and
if it doth not cut and wound
the hearts of the bad to humiliation,
yet ſhall it bee a
great witnes againſt them to
their deſtruction, and in time
perhaps force them to confeſſe
(as we ſee in Pharoh
himſelfe being but a heathen)
againſt themſelues, and
to giue glory to God, though
they be not brought to true
repentance: For hee, who
thought there had beene no
King aboue himſelfe, and
therefore ſaid to Moſes, who
is the Lord that I ſhould ſerue
him? Yet when Moſes by his

doctrine and miracles had
proued, that there was one aboue
him, he profited ſo well
thereby, that when hee was
violently holden in the waters,
purſuing Gods people,
and ſaw them deliuered, hee
could ſay then, the Lord ſighteth
for them againſt vs.
               
            
            
               Doct. 5. The hypocrite cōuicted, 
                     〈…〉
                  
               
               
                  VERS. 15.
                  And Saul ſaid, they haue
brought them from the Amalekites:
for the people ſpared
the beſt of the ſheepe, and
of the oxen, to ſacrifice vnto
the Lord thy God, and
the reſt we haue vtterly
deſtroyed.
               
               BVt now let vs ſee how it
wroght vpō 
                  Saul, when
Samuel had ſo plainely conuinced

him, that if he would
haue dealt vprightly and anſwered
him directly, he muſt
needes, either haue accuſed
himſelfe as guilty, or elſe he
muſt haue cleered and iuſtified
himſelfe: he did not the
firſt, and the laſt he could not
doe, being double hearted:
and therefore fell to meere
ſhifting and ſophiſtrie, as appeared
by his words, which
conteyne two points.The words opened. For
that which was euill done of
him and of the people, hee
layeth it wholy to their
charge, and yet he ſaith, if
they were faulty in that
which they did, it might be
the better borne, ſeeing they
did it to glorifie God by ſacrifice.
This was the firſt
point of his anſwere in theſe
words, Theſe ſhepee and oxen

which thou heareſt, they
haue brought from the Amalakites,
for the people ſpared
the beſt of the cattle to
ſacrifice to the Lord. The ſecond
poynt of his anſwer
was, that in the things that
God was obeyed in, he had
his hand in them, and was a
doer of them among the reſt,
in theſe words, the reſt we
haue deſtroyed. But in this doing,
had he, think we obeyed
the commandment of the
Lord? In no wiſe; nay; he
hauing boldly and manifeſtly
caſt it behinde his backe,
did he relent for and bewaile
his fault? oh nothing leſſe;
then it is cleere as I ſaid, that
he did but waſh off the Prophets
reproofes, ſhameleſly
by a ſhift. For he knew that
he had done wickedly; and

yet hee had doubled his ſin
by a lye; for afterwards hee
confeſſed it.
               And this bewrayeth another
ſin in hypocrites: that
though in words they can
make good their cauſe, and
can iuſtifie themſelues to be
as blameleſſe as any other,
yet hee that will obſerue it,
ſhall finde, that they will neuer
bee brought to plaine
dealing, nor be willing, what
ſoeuer they ſay, to be iudged
by the Word of God. The
reaſon is, their conſcience
tels them they are guilty.
They would make a ſimple
body beleeue, that none
would more readily yeeld to
haue their doings tried by
the Scripture then they (as is
to be ſeene in them who call
for the day of the Lord)

which if they would doe indeede,
they ſhould proue
themſelues to bee ſuch, as
they would be taken for, that
is good Chriſtians, and faithfull
ſeruants of God: but alas
it is nothing ſo with them,
but they pleaſe themſelues
in thinking, that their eſtate
is good, ſeeing they do ſome
things that are commanded:
but in what manner, and
with what affection, they do
them, and to what end, or in
how many things they offend,
they will in no ſort be
brought to examine, as may
bee ſeene by the Phariſie in
the Goſpel. Lord I thank thee
I am not as other men.
                  L k 18▪
                   But if
they be driuen by ſome occaſion
to bee more nerely
ſifted & examined, whether
their liues be as innocent as

they boaſt them to be, then
ye ſhall ſee them bewray that
they are poſſeſſed with Sauls
ſpirit, that is, not to anſwere,

                     •
                  or cleere themſelues by the
word: but ſeekes ſhiftes, by
bringing in pretences of
their good workes and prayers:
and that they bee not
(they hope) ſo bad as ſome,
& that they would bee loath
it ſhould be proued by them,
meaning ſome open & groſſe
offenders, or elſe thus they
ſhift and ſay, doe not ſome
profeſſors the ſame that wee
doe, yet they are thought
well of, and they would that
none did worſe then themſelues,
and though they haue
not ſuch knowledge as ſome
haue (they ſay) nor cannot
make ſuch ſhewes as ſome
doe, yet they truſt they haue

as good hearts, and meant as
well as the beſt. By theſe and
ſuch like ſhiftings they defend
themſelues; but what is
all this to the purpoſe, to free
themſelues from blame: Is
this to go to worke plainely,
and to ſticke to the Scripture
to bee tryed by them? The
which palpable and groſſe
deceiuing of themſelues,
when it is ſhewed them, doe
they acknowledge and ſo repent
of it? which yet if they
were truely humbled, they
would doe. Therefore let it
be taken for a cleere note of
rancke hypocriſie, when any
being iuſtly charged and accuſed
of manifeſt and great
faultes, they ſhall neither
cleere themſelues by the
Scriptures, nor confeſſe their
ſinnes, and bewaile their eſtate,

but ſhift for themſelues
diſhoneſtly, as hath beene
ſhewed. This is plaine enough
of them, which will
vnderſtand, whether they bee
ſound Chriſtians and true
worſhippers of God, or
whether they bee meere diſſemblers
and hipocrites. And
thus much of the firſt part,
that is, of their communication
betwixt them, before the
meſſage of the Lord was
done.
               
                  VERSE. 16.
                  
                     Then Samuel ſaid vnto Saul,
ſtay, and I will tell thee what
the Lord hath ſaid to mee this
night. And he ſaid unto him,
ſay on.
                  
               
               NOw when Samuel ſaw
how Saul ſhifted, and

would not conſider wiſely
of his reproofe, he thought
hee ſhould moue him by telling
him, how God was offended
with him: & for better
preparing him heereto, he
offers, firſt to tell him what
the Lord had ſaid to him
that night. Out of the which
words of Samuel this may firſt
be ſaid, Oh how did he ſhew
that hee loued him? and the
like ſpirit ſtill poſſeſſing the
godly it may be ſaid. Oh; the
deſire the godly haue to doe
them good, whoſe caſe they
ſee to bee ſo bad, which is a
moſt commendable thing as
I am affraid for the wicked,Ezek. 9.
and they vexed the ſoule of
righteous Lot.
                  Ierem. 9. 1. But in many
where is this loue become?Pſal. 11 9.
it is waſhed away commonly,
although what is a more

beſeeming thing, then to
mourne for the deſolation
of the people? But to go forward,
this might and ought
worthily to haue ſhaken his
heart with feare, when Samuel
did but ſay, that God
had that night ſpoken of
him, and that alſo in finding
great fault in him: for when
hee hard that, hee might by
and by haue thought of his
ſinne (as Eli in the like cauſe
feared, when the Lord had
called Samuel) and that hee
was like to heare of ſomething,1 Sam 3. 17
which ſhould be little
welcom vnto him: as he had
before, chap. 13. 13. yet hee
was nothing aſtoniſhed at
that ſpeech, but bad him ſay
on, and vtter his minde,
which doth bewray the
hardneſſe of his heart.
               
                  
Whereby wee may note,Hardnes of heart & boldnes, are ſignes of hypocriſie.
that when men ſee their
faults, and yet will go about
to hide and couer them, (as
hee did here) they are moſt
certainely hardned againſt
all doctrine, or friendly inſtruction,
which ſhall be offred
vnto them, and ſo incurre
the danger that is oft
ſpoken of in the Scripture:
Hee that hardneth his heart,
                  Prou. 28.
                  ſhall ſurely come to euill. How
true this is, as in Ionah appeareth,
when hee fled to Tarſhiſh,
ſo experience teacheth:
and how fearfull a thing
this hardening of the heart
is, may be ſeene by this, that
the hardened heart cannot
repent, and by the contrary,
melting and relenting of the
heart, which is the companion
of a meek & humble hart:

which as it readily receiueth
admonition and reproofe, ſo
it auoydeth that ſting and
diſquietnes, which otherwiſe
would follow. But this fault
of hardening the heart?
though hee that committeth
it groſſely doth moſt hardly
eſpie and ſee in himſelfe, yet
when it is ſeene of him, it is
not ſo eaſily ſhaken off and
forſaken. When it ſhall be
but ſaid to a man, as heere,
God hath ſpoken heauily againſt
thee (though the fault
bee not particularly mentioned)
and as it is ſaid to the
Church of the Epheſians by
the Lord,Reu. 2. 4. 
                  I haue ſomwhat againſt
thee: though it be not
yet tolde expreſſely what,
ought it not, thinke we, to
ſhake and feare him? and
cauſe him to ſay, what haue I

done? that ſo he may by inquirie,
and deeper ſearch into
himſelfe, finde it out. And
yet were this no more then
became him: but comfortable
to them who ſhould behold
it, and profitable to
him who would ſhew it.
               But ſuch grace is far from
them that will not ſee their
ſinnes; no though they come
to the light, where they; haue
them made knowne vnto
them. So much the more
woefull is the eſtate of this
age, whoſe deedes being euill
and their hearts naught, and
they louing darkenes more
then light, are with hardened
foreheads, armed and ſetled
to ſhake off all reproofes, and
words of exhortation, as
though God knew not their
workes, who yet ſearcheth

hearts, and to iuſtiſie their
preſent eſtate, be it neuer ſo
bad; and ſo pulling that wo
vpon them, which is ſpoken
of by the Prophet:Eſa. 5. 
                  Woe to
them which call euill good, and
darkneſſe light. And left I
ſhould be thought to ſpeake
of the worſt ſort of theſe, I
ſay, that euen the beſt ſort of
them veriſie the words of another
Prophet, where hee
ſaith.Ezek. 33. Vſe. 
                  Thou ſonne of man, this
people will ſit and heare thy
voyce as muſike, but they will
not doe thereafter. Therfore
they, who deſire to profit by
this, muſt reſolue with themſelues,
to beware conſcionably
of the ſmalleſt ſins, and
that ſuch as cannot be auoyded,
may not yet be nouriſhed
nor retained, but with
all poſſible ſpeede hunted

out and purſued, leſt if they
once begin to winke at any
of them, and ſo giue them
welcome, they after harden
their hearts to maintaine
them; and laſtly, beſide both,
let them walke in a continuall
ſuſpition of ſome one or
other of their ſinnes, eſpecially
ſuch as they are moſt
prone to, and moſt in danger
of. So ſhall they be free from
this hardnes of heart, which
is (with pride, whereto it is
linked) a certaine fore-runner
of deſtruction, euen as
it is cleere note of an hypocrite.
            
            
               
               Doct. 6. When we are yet in meane eſtate, each benefit is thankworthy.
               
                  VERSE 17, 18, 19.
                  And Samuel ſayd, When thou
wast little in thine owne
ſight, waſt thou not made the
Head of the Tribes of Iſrael,
and the LORD anoynted thee
King ouer Iſrael?
                  And the LORD ſent thee on a
iourney, and ſayd, Goe, and
vtterly deſtroy the ſinners,
the Amalekites, and fight againſt
them, vntill they bee
conſumed.
                  Wherefore then didſt thou not
obey the voyce of the LORD,
but didſt flie vpon the ſpoyle,
and didſt euill in the ſight of
the LORD.
                  
               
               NOw in this verſe, it followeth,
how Samuel
tels Saul, what God had

ſaid to him that night, to wit,
that he had aduanced him to
the kingdome, when he was
meane and baſe, therefore
that hee ought to haue honoured
and obeyed him,
whome he had ſo preferred:
yea, (ſaith he) when the Lord
commaunded thee to deſtroy
vtterly the Amalakites,
thou diddeſt not as hee commaunded
thee, how canſt
thou anſwere this? Furthermore
hee ſaid, that thou
ſoughteſt thine owne gaine
and glorie, by diſobeying
him, therefore it repenteth
him that he made thee King.
In theſe three verſes among
other things, note this generally,
which the Lord complaineth
of, that when men
are of meane eſtate and lowe,
they can prize Gods benefits

at an high reckoning, and
count them great and precious,
as Saul did the raiſing
him to the Kingdom, counting
himſelfe vnworthy of it,
but when they once wax
mighty, they forget themſelues,
and make his benefits
common things, little worth
euen as he did, not reuerencing
and obeying him that
honored him. A moſt worthy
inſtruction, and fit for
our time, wherein may bee
found ſo infinite perſons,
which for want of well learning
it, haue vndone themſelues,
hauing their owne
conſciences to accuſe them,
and their mouthes to witnes
againſt them: who, when
they were baſe and of no account,
were glad of euery
ſmall bleſſing of God, counting

themſelues vnworthy of
the ſame: but when God
hath lifted them vp aboue
their expectation, how ſoone
haue they groſſely & ſhamefully
degenerated from their
former minde and thought,
as if they had neuer beene
the ſame perſons? And yet I
ſpeake not of the mad, rude,
and ignorant ſort of the
world, (who being without
common honeſty, and ciuility,
what other thing is to bee
looked for at their hands▪)
but of ſuch as are vnder good
teaching, and will as readily
conſent to the doctrine, and
ſpeake againſt ſuch as are offenders,
as ſoone as any;
who yet moſt wofully doe
ſhew their inconſtancy, and
diſguiſednes to the whole
world.
               
                  
And to begin with them,Some examples.
who of all other ſhould bee
furtheſt off from this ſinne,1. In the Miniſtry. I
meane the Miniſters, how
many of them, ſince the light
of knowledge did begin to
ſhine in their hearts: (ſo that
either they were become
teachers of others, being
as yet ſchollersin the vniuerſities,
or at leaſt old enough
to teach and gouerne themſelues)
haue ſaid it, and fully
purpoſed, that if they might
bee thought meet to bee imployed
in the ſeruice of the
Church, and to enioy liuing
to maintaine themſelues and
theirs, how many I ſay haue
ſayd it, that they would beſtow
their talent diligently,
teaching the Lords flocke,
& liuing among them kindely
& Chriſtianly, and painefully

and vnoffenſiuely, among
whome they ſhould
be placed, and with contentation
in their eſtate and condition:
only they haue
thought themſelues vnmeet
for ſo hie a calling, and haue
ſaid that they were vnworthie
to reape the fruites of a
ſmall people and congregation.
I am ſure I ſpeake the
truth in many, whome my
ſelfe haue knowne, and of others
I haue heard the ſame,
by men of good credit: who
yet when they began to riſe
to credit, degrees, fauour with
their betters, and God had
giuen them more liuing then
they could deſire or hope
for, they haue little conſidered
what they had ſaid before;
but with their liuings
and promotions, their hearts

haue riſen, till they ſeeing
what liberties the time
would affoord them, and
how they might haue elbow
roome, and to rule ouer others,
as the creeping Iuie,
which ouergrowes and maſters
the ſtrongeſt oke, rather
then to be called to their account
by others, they by little
and little, became vtterly
changed, as if they had neuer
beene the men, which before
they ſeemed to bee: leauing
wholly the care of their
flocks, and gaue themſelues
to liue at eaſe, and to ſeeke
after more liuing: neither ſeeking
the loſt, nor ſtrengthening
the weake, they neither healed
the ſick, nor bound vp the broken,
yet cloathing themſelues
with the wooll: and ſome of
them (forgetting their couenant

ſometime made to the
Lord) liued vnkindely with
the people, and with crueltie
and rigour, and ruling and dominering
ouer them: and attended
not to reading, exhortation
and doctrine, as they
knew they ought to haue
done? It is a generall obſeruation,
that before the time
of Conſtantine and the good
Emperours, the Clergie beeing
then perſecuted and vnder
the croſſe, ſtood ſtoutly
to the defence of the truth,
and oppoſed hereſie, and
profanenes with equall courage?
Who yet beeing (as
warmed in the boſome of
eaſe and preferment) grew
both diuided among themſelues,
and ſlacke in their
zeale and miniſtrie, ſeeking
their owne things, and quite

giuing ouer their care of the
publique welfare? And out
of this root, by degrees aroſe
the Papacie, to that head of
ambition and inſolencie. But
to return, where it now venteth,
euen iuſt ſo hath the wine
& oile of many forward preachers,
whereby they cheered
the heart of God & man, degenerated
into the vineger &
dregs of ſloth and pride. As
the traueller being put to it,
by the winde & weather, claſpeth
his cloake more cloſely
to him: but being in the warm
ſunne, caſteth it off, as not able
to beare it, ſo haue theſe
done: verefying the prouerbe,
that religion had
brought forth wealth, and
the daughter had deuoured
the mother. But alas, where
ſhall remedie bee ſought for

this if it pleaſe not God to
breake their harts, and bring
them from that their vnfaithfull
dealing with God, to true
repentance, by conſidering,
how farre they haue degenerated
from former times,
and broken their couenants
which they made with him,
when they thought they
ought to doe no leſſe; and
yet I ſay, they kept them not.
               But to proceed from the
miniſters to the people,A ſecond example of the people. how
haue many of them, after
that God hath enlightened
them with the knowledge, &
liking of the truth, and ſtirred
them vp by the examples of
others, to a care of reforming
their liues, how (I ſay) haue
many teſtified the ſame, by
weeping & bewayling their
ſinnes, by diligent hearing of

ſermons, keeping companie
with godly Chriſtians, forſaking
the fellowſhip of the
prophane, & their prophane
gaming and playing, into
making many purpoſes, neuer
to do as they haue done:
inſomuch, that they gaue
great hope to become rare
Chriſtians? And being mean
in their owne eyes, when the
Lord aduanced them to the
hope of a farre better eſtate,
and gaue them a taſte of the
life to come, and fauor with
his good ſeruants, that yet
afterward, not wiſely and
circumſpectly walking, not
fearing the allurements of
the world on the one ſide,
nor the diſcouragements
from duty on the other
ſide, fell from their good beginnings,
and ſo became reuolters

from thier firſt loue,
declaring to thier iuſt reproch
and ſhame, that now
they waxed full, an honycomb
was not pleaſant vnto
them, vnto whom ſomtime
euery common inſtruction
had been ſweet and ſauoury.
               And to ſpeak more particularly:A third, of dealers in the world.
how many at their
entring into the dealings of
the world, and their fathers
inheritance, other in ſeeking
marriages, and ſome liuing
in hope of commodities and
preferment: and others in
their ſicke beds haue ſeriouſly
couenanted, that if
God would now grant them
the deſire of their harts, they
would euer after glorifie
him, and ſay that he had done
great things for them. Who
yet when they haue enioyed

their deſires haue ſoone forgot
their hot & raſh vowes,
and haue ſome of them beſtowed
thoſe benefites of God
vpon their luſts:
                  Iam. 4. and others
haue eaten their word, and
haue made light of thoſe
things which before, they ſo
earneſtly deſired, & wiſhed
for: as namely in the marriages
of the moſt, we ſee daily
it is verefied, and ſo of all
ſorts it may be ſaid; when
they haue gotte that which
they deſired, they haue become
altogether other men.
Therefore they may much
reioyce, who can hold that
conſtancie, that they can
thinke it meete, that all they
haue, ſhould honour God,
and whatſoeuer they enioy,
they can remember that
once they had nothing, and

therefore that they ſhould
not lift vp themſelues, which
is fooliſhnes, ſaying they
haue receiued it, nor prouoke
God, by vnthankfulnes,
to ſtrippe them off all,
and to giue them ouer as the
other doe, whoſe laſt eſtate
ſhould be worſe then their
beginning; whereas, if there
had beene no other reaſon,
to perſwade them to conſtancy,
in care of godly liuing,
this might haue beene
ſufficient to them, that their
cauſe had ſometime beene
farre better, and that they
had ſometime beene glad,
namely, in their meaner eſtate,
to make promiſes to
God of better ſeruice,
though now they had
ſhamefully neglected it.
            
            
               Doct. 7. The greater and more our bleſſiings haue bene, the greater ſhall our accompt be.
               An other thing in theſe

three verſes, let vs marke and
learne, that ſeeing God calleth
him to an account for
the vſe of his benefites, for
that he yeilded not to him,
the fruite of them, that hee
will require at our hands,
how we haue vſed, the good
things that he beſtoweth on
vs; For thus he ſaith, I aduanced
thee, & did greatt hings
for thee, in reſpect of many
others. And why? for any
worthines of thine? no: but
that I might haue thee more
attendant to me, and at commandement,
and aboue many
other, ſeruiceable vnto
mee: yet thou haſt in this
great charge of deſtroying
vtterly this curſed
nation of the Amalakites,
caſt my commandement behinde
thee. And ſo he ſaid

to Dauid, Ieroboam and others.
So that when men
come to receiue at Gods
hands any benefites, they
ſhould not only thinke of
the ſweetnes and greatnes of
them, and how they be inriched
by him, which is the
next way to make them
proud, and high minded, as
we ſee in the boaſting Phariſie,Luke 18.
but we ſhould know that
there goeth alwaies a charge
and a burthen with them, as
that God looketh, that their
hearts ſhould bee knitte to
him, who hath bleſſed them,
vndeſeruedly aboue others.
Which Dauid acknowledged,
and teacheth all others
the ſame, when he ſaith to
Michaell his wife, mocking
him for honouring of God,
in dancing before the Arke,

and reioycing that it was
brought home vnto his Cittie:
This that I doe (ſaith he)
is for no worldly affection,
                  2 Sam. 6. 21 
                  but
for the zeale that I beare to
Gods glory, who choſe me rather
then thy father and all his
houſe, and commanded me to
be ruler ouer the people of the
Lord. He confeſſed, that ſeeing
God had ſo honoured
him, he was bound, and
could not chuſe, but he muſt
honour God againe, which
was the end and cauſe, why
he had aduanced him.
               Whereby we may ſee,
that God doth looke for it
at mens hands, that they
ſhould be knit to him, and
wholly at his pleaſure, when
he beſtoweth theſe benefites
vpon rhem, which their beſt
friends, and mightieſt potentates

cannot: and wee
muſt knowe, that God doth
where he giueth much, look
for much againe;Amos. 3. and vpon
whome he beſtoweth his talents,
he looketh that they
ſhould faithfully,Luke 19. and diligently
occupie and imploy
the ſame. And who is ſo ignorant
that he knoweth not
this, that when men of abillitie
caſt their fauour vpon
any, or benefite them vndeſeruedly,
rather then others,
that they looke for kindenes
& good will againe (though
for no recompence) more
then in a common manner.
And if all grant that this is
ſo cleere, that it needeth little
proofe, that where more is
receiued of God, they owe more
to him againe; and ſo are
bound to ſet forth his glory,

                  who hath raiſed them from
the dunghill, to great liberties,
and prerogatiues, how ſhall
men euer be able to anſwere
this, that whereas they receiue
all that they haue of
Gods meere liberality and
bounty, yet they feele not,
nor finde themſelues in any
ſort affected and knit to him,
or to ſeeke to pleaſe him, by
doing the things which hee
commandeth, neither wonder
at his fauours to them,
rather then to many others,
& ſo to prouoke themſelues
with a thankfull heart to ſay
as the Prophet did, what ſhall
I render the Lord,
                  Pſal. 116. 
                  for all his
mercies beſtowed on me? And
againe, when they ſee their
backwardnes, and ſlownes
in ſuch duties, then to ſtirre
vp themſelues, and to ſay

with him in another place,
O my ſoule,
                  Pſal. 103. 
                  praiſe thou the
Lord, and all that is within me
praiſe his holy name: And if
when they haue done all, that
they can ſay, they are but vnprofitable
ſeruants,
                  Luk. 17. as Chriſt
tells them, what are they
that doe not goe about, to
doe that which they might
well doe, neither once accuſe
themſelues, though
they be idle,Luk. 
                        •
                     9. and burying
their tallants in the ground?
I ſay therefore, that men that
liue in this our age, to receiue
ſo much at Gods
hands, as health, wealth, liberty,
peace, the Goſpell,
with many ſuch, ſhall neuer
be able to anſwere it to
God, when notwithſtanding
all theſe, they haue no
zeale for his glorie, they obey

not his Goſpell, they
bring not forth fruit, as they
might now, if at any time.
They are not like, but worſe
then the Oxe and the Aſſe,
who knowe their owners,
and their maſters cribbe, and
as the Horſe and Mule,Iohn 15. 9. who
haue no vnderſtanding to
ſee,Pſal. 32. what they owe to him.Eſay. 1.
               
               Our fathers and brethren
of happie memorie, in the
late dayes of Queene Mary,
could reioyce with thankes,
for his mercies beſtowed on
them, that God by his prouidence
granted them to be
fellow-priſoners, together
within the ſame walls: wee
haue libertie not to be ioyned
together in the ſame
priſon, but to inioy together
the benefites of the Lords
Sabbaths, in publique and

priuate, and to keepe hollyday
in his houſe,Note. and it is
noyſome and weariſome to
vs: yea, we ſit ſafely vnder
our vine, and vnder our figtree,
liuing peaceably in our
owne houſes, with all the
commoditie and comfort
that may be reaped thereby,
yet men cannot now ſound
forth his praiſes with reioycing,
oh that is a dead and
weariſome worke, they cannot
be thankefull, and ſhew
it forth by duties of loue,
and other fruites of faith, as
it were meete, but are laſciuious,
prophane, and deſpiſing
ſuch as doe ſo, finding
of fault with their liues, ſeeing
that they are better then
their owne. This and ſuch
like is, the vſe that the moſt
do make at this day, of Gods

manyfold benefites now; as
it is to be ſeene generally
through townes and families,
and in infinite perſons,
in ſo much that I doe confeſſe
(and I will not be aſhamed
to ſay it) that I would
thinke my ſelfe, as happie as
the moſt, if I could weepe
bitterly for the loſſe of this
people,Eſay. 22. and if my eies could
guſh out with water, for
that I ſee ſo infinite benefites
of God are ſo wickedly
beſtowed and waſted, euen
eſpecially and cheefely, in
whoredome, drunkenneſſe,
pride, idlenes, gaming, and
other ſuch abhominations,
and fruites of the fleſh: And
if I ſhould goe about particularly,
to ſhewe it in the diuerſe
and ſnndry eſtates, degrees
and perſons, I ſhould

not knowe where, nor when
to make an end. Therefore
I will conclude this point,
that ſeeing God asketh to
haue another manner of
fruite, of his ſo innumerable
vndeſerued kindeneſſes, and
that where more is receiued,
there ſhould more bee yeilded
him againe, I will I ſay
conclude with this ſpeach,
much like to that of the
prophet Amos.
                  Amis. 3. 3. This nation
and people among many other
hath the Lord knowne,
and choſen to beſtowe his
goſpell and benefites vpon,
therefore he will moſt ſurely
viſit it for her iniquities,
and then it ſhall ſee that
there was an other manner
of vſe, to haue beene made
of them. This cauſeth many
of them, whome in deſpight

they call preciſians to
looke ſomewhat more carefully,
to their liues then others
doe, knowing what
cauſe they haue receiued to
doe ſo, euen to render vnto
the Lord, the fruite thereof.
And yet we cannot yeilde
him one of the thankes, wee
owe him of a thouſand.
            
            
               Doct. 8. God will not be ſerued by halfes.
               What the Lord inioyned
Saul, we haue heard, that is,
that he ſhould vtterly dſtroy
the Amalakites, and what
Saul did we haue alſo heard,
that is, that in part, he did as
God had commanded him:
but how ſuch obeying pleaſed
God, is ſhewed heere,
where he calls it wickednes,
all that he had done, and a
not obeying: for thus hee
ſaith, why haſt thou not obeyed
the voyce of the

Lord, but haſt done wickedly?
So that when he ſerued
the Lord but in part, and (as
we ſay) by halfe ſeruice, God
vtterly abhorres it. To teach
vs, that he will not be ſerued
of vs by halfes, as that wee
ſhould do ſome thing which
he requireth, and to leaue others
vndone, which hee
commands: and that we
would leaue and chuſe at
our owne pleaſure, and ſo
to patch vp his ſeruice as we
thinke good, and not to giue
ouer our ſelues, in full purpoſe
to endeauour to pleaſe
him in all things, God will
not beare, nor put it vp at
our hands.
               And great reaſon,Reaſons. we may
ſee of this: For ſeeing hee
doth require (as moſt iuſtly
he may) to be ſerued withall

our heart, as we reade in the
Prouerbes, giue me thine
heart my ſonne:Prou. 23. And agine,
delight thou in my waies
continually,Peo. 23. 26. And ſeeing we
are commanded, whatſoeuer
we doe, whether we eate
or drink, to do all to his honour.1 Cor. 10. 32
Who doth not ſee but
that halfe ſeruice,Coloſ. 1. 10. and abridging
him of his due, is abhominable:
and that to obey
him, when, where, and how
we thinke good, although
in many things we doe that
which he commands, is to
ſerue him negligently, and
therefore to bee no better
then in a curſed eſtate, as it
is written. Curſed is he that
ſerueth God negligently.Iere. 48. 10
               
               And yet ſuch is the moſt
mens ſeruing of God at this
day, euen as Saul did heere,

not with an honeſt and vpright
heart, from dutie to
dutie, and in one part of
their life, as in another: oh!
that were too ſtrickt and
preciſe, to tie vp our rebellions
and vnruly luſts ſo
ſhort, but to part ſtakes with
the Lord, that the moſt part
of our life be giuen to our
ſelues, to ſerue the luſts of
the fleſh, and to follow the
ſuggeſtions of Sathan, and
the deceiuable allurements
of the world, and the reſt if
any remaine, (as he that is
wiſe, will eaſile geſſe how
ſmall that will be) the reſt (I
ſay) ſhall bee giuen vnto
God. This is the moſt mens
ſeruing and obeying of God
as I ſaid: euen as the common
and better ſort of ciuill
men, doe declare in their

owne words, who if they be
asked what they thinke the
obeying and ſeruing of God
to be, they affirme ſimply to
goe to Church on the Sabbathes,
and if farther it be
asked, what then is to bee
done, they make no queſtion
if it be once done, but
that euery man may doe,
what he thinketh good, eithe
worke or play or be idle,
as appeareth by thoſe that
are buſie, and goe about lazily,
and lie at ſhop windowes,
and there prate, and
be talking of one body or
other, of this worldly matter
or that, which doe nothing
belong to them, and
thus paſſe away the time. I
ſpeake not now of the ſcum
and of ſcourings of townes,
who yet goe as farre beyond

theſe in diſobeying of God,
and in wicked life, as theſe
herein goe beyond honeſt
and true chriſtians. And ſo
ſhall ye finde it in all eſtates
and conditions of people.
               Now,Such come ſhort of Saul.
                   if they thinke and
hold this for their opinion,
that the ſeruing and obeying
of God, conſiſts in ſuch
a ſleight keeping of the ſabboath
(as by the ſpeach and
practiſe of too many may
eaſily bee gathered) I in
comparing them with Saul,
and making them like to
him, aſcribe more to them
then is their due. For the
ſtorie both in this and ſome
other chapters before, doth
clearely and largely ſhewe,
how he beſides the publique
ſeruing of God, did many
worthy and religious actions

and commendable, and
did ſee that God was in perticular
actions and partes of
his life, obeyed of him;
wherein he went before the
common ſort of ſuch as be
called Proteſtants, who are
not troubled from morning
to night, nor from the beginning
of the weeke to the
end, how they obey or diſobey
the lawes of God in the
courſe of their liues, or how
they liue: but hold this in
their iudgement, that they
neede not ſtretch their care,
nor take any thought that
way. And yet Saul, who did
goe before them ſo farre (as
may apparantly be ſeene,)
becauſe hee did not duely
looke vnto, and carefully
diſcharge ſuch duties as hee
tooke in hand, and in part

alſo did performe, wee ſee
how God ſetteth him as it
were vpon the ſtage, as a gazing
ſtocke to be looked vpon,
and for not obeying
him ſendeth a heauie meſſage
vnto him, how he was
diſpleaſed with him, and
pronounced this fearefull
ſentence vpon him, to wit, it
repenteth me that I haue
made him King.
               And therefore what iuſt
cauſe haue the common ſort
of this people,Application of the point. 1. To the péople of the worſer ſort. to lament, and
bewaile their eſtate and condition,
who in this long
time wherein the goſpell
hath brought light among
them, haue not [I dare bee
bold to ſay and haue prooued
it] ſo much knowledge
and care as he had; nor occupie
themſelues ſo much in

many duties doing to God
in their particular actions,2. To Miniſters. as
he did: Yea, and if this were
well conſidered, what care
and diligence ſhould it ſtirre
vp in the miniſters, to pitty
this miſerable condicion of
the people, and with all earneſtnes
and loue, to make
the ſame known vnto them,
and to diſſwade them from
it, as much as in them lyeth?
For if God might iuſtly
challenge Saul, for this ſeruing
him by halfes and
ſlightly, what ſhall he haue
againſt them, who (a fewe
things excepted, and thoſe
yet to ſmall purpoſe) ſerue
him not at all in their common
actions and courſe of
life? And yet that this may
be no defence for them, that
they goe with others to the

publique place to worſhip
God, it may be truely ſaid,
that many of them doe that
more for loue then for conſcience:
and yet many heere
thinke, that for that very
action, they are to be taken
for right good Chriſtians.
               But now that I haue proued
that the moſt part come
behind Saul for the practiſe
of religion,3. To hollow profeſſors. and obedience
to God, giue me leaue to go
a little further, and by this
occaſion of Sauls ſinne, to
ſhewe them their face as it
were in a glaſſe, who can in
no wiſe proue themſelues
better then he was. Of this
ſecond ſort therefore a little.
For I would be loath, whiles
I am ſpeaking againſt the
ſeruing of God by halfes, to
be iuſtly charged in this ſo

weightie a matter, to do my
dutie but by halſes, by ſpeaking
but of the one halfe of
them, whome the text concerneth.
To paſſe therefore
from this ſort of men, to another,
which more nearely
reſembleth Saul, and in outward
apparance goeth farre
beyond the former in religious
duties: I make no doubt
but that the greateſt part,
who haue any vprightnes of
iudgement and gift to diſcerne,
will readily agree
with mee in that I haue ſaid
of the former kinde. There
will be greater queſtion, about
this latter. Not for that
it is ſo doubtfull, but for that
many are ſo blinde in particular
cauſes, and ſo partiall
in iudgement. For otherwiſe
euen this may determine

the queſtion, if in this
time of clearer light, men
can haue no greater proofe
of their godlines, and ſyncerity,
then Saul had in a time
of groſſer and deeper darknes.
I hope none will denie,
but that they are as deepe in
the puniſhment, and are as
guiltie of it, and ſo continuing,
ſhall as certainly goe vnder
it as he did. And to bewray
thoſe two ſorts of
men, I did as I ſaide in the
beginning, vnfold this ſcripture.
               Now therefore this I ſay,
if God could beare Saul no
longer, but giue him ouer to
be vexed with an euill ſpirit,
as appeareth he did in the
next chapter, and that for
his halting and obeying
God by halfes, and for that

hee did it not in ſynceritie
and faithfully, what hope
haue they to God-ward,
which doe the like? Therefore,
if many now among vs,
not only worſhippe God
publiquely, but alſo priuately
take his word into their
mouthes, ſo that outwardly
and openly, they ſhewe
themſelues to bee good
Chriſtians, yea, if in many
things they doe after the
doctrine which they learne
out of the word, yet if they
do it but in ſome things, and
endeauour not in all,Note well. what
vprightnes can be in them?
According to that of ſaint
lames,
                  Jam. 2. he that keepeth all the
commandements, and breaketh
ſome one of them, is
guiltie of all: meaning, that
he that will not be ſubiect

to God in one thing as well
as in another, ſhall ſhew his
contempt of Gods maieſtie,
who is the law giuer, euen as
he doth who ſhall declare it
in many things: which ſaying
of the Apoſtle, agreeth
with that of the Prophet Ezechiell:
                  Ezek. 18.
If a man be a theefe
or a ſhedder of blood, or
hath defiled his neighbours
wife, or if he doe any one of
theſe things, though he doe
not all of them, but hath
oppreſſed the poore, or hath
giuen forth vpon vſurie, hee
ſhall die the death, and his
blood ſhall be vpon him,
What can bee more plaine
then this,Ezek 18. 10. which the Prophet
ſpeaketh to proue, that
though a man be free from
many defilements, and yet

                     •
                  ainted with ſome one; or if

contrarily hee will bee forward
in many duties, and
yet will not be ſubiect to the
will of God in other, which
he knoweth to be required
as well as in them, what is
plainer (I ſay) then this, that
God will not accept of him,
but take him for one which
ſerues him by halfes? And
who can gather, that Saul
was for any other cauſe reiected
of the Lord?
               Then we muſt come from
this cōmon ſeruing of God,What ſuch ſhould do.
(which yet is farre before
the former) and yet alike
reiected of God as it is: and
conſequently all ſuch as deſire
that God may accept of
their ſeruice, and take them
that offer it for his beloued,
in whome he delighteth,
muſt bring themſelues into

a narrow compaſſe, and
ſtretch their care further;
that is to ſay, they muſt reſolue
and couenant to take
heede to their wayes, and
courſe of life more particularly,
and labour faithfully
in one thing as in another, to
pleaſe God according to the
meaſure of their knowledge.
And I dare boldly affirme
by the authority of theſe
forenamed ſcriptures, that
he which dyeth with leſſe
then this, and hath not repented
for it, nor obtayned
pardon of it, dyeth in the
diſpleaſure of God and cannot
be ſaued.
               And this is moſt fearefull
if we conſider,Further vſe of this doctrine. that if any
beleeuing this, doe addreſſe
themſelues to this care and
practiſe, they are by and by

ſcorned and ſcoffed at,1. In reproofe of ſcorning. and
reproachfully taunted, and
tawed with odious and reproachfull
names of hypocrites,
and ſuch like: as if
they would boldly contend
with, and ſet themſelues againſt
God in their ſo doing:
when he ſaith on the one
ſide to men, except they liue
thus they are indeede hypocrites,
and cannot be ſaued,
and they directly contrary
anſwere and ſay, if they doe
liue thus, they are diſſemblers,
fooles and troubleſome,
in which eſtate they
cannot be ſaued: For let him
that thinketh himſelfe wiſeſt
of theſe contemners and
diſcouragers of their brethren,
ſpeake. Is it for any
other cauſe that they diſgrace
and crie out of them

then this? that their deedes
are good, and their owne euill?
For if they could bee
content to ſerue God looſely
and to halfes as they doe,
there ſhould be no riſing of
heart againſt them: no verily:
but euen therefore they
are their ſongs and matter to
talke of. But if for all this
they will iuſtifie their halfe
ſeruing of God to be ſufficient
to commend them to
him, and that in ſo doing
none doe liue better then
themſelues, I leaue them to
a deeper conſideration of it.
I haue ſhewed what ſeruice
God requireth, euen ſuch as
they that offer it, ſhould take
heede that there be not at any
time in any of them an euill
heart; and that they
ſhould endeauour whether

they eate or drinke, or whatſoeuer
they doe, that all
ſhould be to the praiſe of
God: and by watching and
prayer, they ſhould keepe
from the temptations that
others are ouercome of.2. Comfort to the vpright. And
as for the infirmities that
cleaue to them in this
courſe, they ſhall be forgiuen
them, and ſhall not hinder
them from true and
ſound reioycing, which is a
perpetuall companion to
ſynceritie: as it is written in
the Pſalme, Reioyce ye righteous,
and be glad all ye that are
vpright in heart. And this
ſhall ſerue for this point.
            
            
               
               
                  Doct. 9. Couetouſnes is the roote of much euill.
               
                  VERSE. 19.
                  Wherefore then didſt thou not
obey the voyce of the LORD,
but didſt flie vpon the ſpoile,
and didſt euill in the ſight of
the LORD?
                  
               
               TO that which I ſaid of
Samuels words to Saul
before:  there is yet another
thing in this ſpeach of Samuells,
which hee deliuered
to Saul from God, I meane
an other ſin of Saul, though
more ſecret, yet horrible in
ſuch a man as he was eſpecially:
and that was that hee,
though a King, was ſet forward
in this halfe ſeruice of
God, by the deſire of the
goods and cattle of the Amalakites,
inſomuch that his

double and deceitfull heart
cauſed him to deale treacherouſly
againſt the Lord,
as in many of his other actions
before, cap. 12. 13. 14.
he had done. For when hee
ſawe what commoditie and
benefite he might reape, in
this charge of killing the
Amalakites, he not looking
vuto the commandement of
God which was vtterly to
deſtroy all, but to the bootie
which he ſawe he might
reape, was carryed away
with the coueting and deſire
of it, and thereby aggrauated
his ſinne exceedingly.
But ſeeing the very ſinne it
ſelfe is particularly ſpoken
of, for which Saul was rebuked,
that is, a braunch of couetouſnes,
in that he turned
to the pray, it ſhall not be

amiſſe to heare ſomthing about
and concerning it.
               For if Saul a King and
therefore rich in all commodities,A caueat.
was caught with the
loue of that execrable thing
I meane the ſpoile of the Amalakites
which God had
commanded to be deſtroyed,
who of meaner eſtate
would a man thinke, is like
to be free from deſiring and
coueting the goods of others?Note.
For the which cauſe
the Apoſtle chargeth in his
epiſtle to Timothie,
                  1 Tim. 3. 6. that a
miniſter though rare, a chriſtian
and reuerend Preacher
[for ſuch ought miniſters to
be] yea, and Timothie himſelfe,
flie and be free from
the deſire of mony, which
cauſeth to fall into temptations
and ſnares: warning

all that they may poſſibly
ſoone fall, yea, dangerouſly
that way, and bring themſelues
into many noyſome
luſtes thereby: If Kings the
mightieſt▪ and Preachers
who ſhould be examples to
others, are in danger of falling
into this ſin, who hath
not cauſe to feare himſelfe
and take warning? For in
this matter of profit our
hearts are falſe and deceitfull
if in any other, Inſomuch
as I may truly ſay that
as many well diſpoſed chriſtians
are much diſguiſed by
occaſion of worldly dealings,
much more other men
who haue little taſt of ſound
doctrine in them: for the
beſt armed and ſeaſoned
chriſtians muſt knowe that
they doe not without dayly

watching and prayer and
obſeruing themſelues, eſcape
the ſnares which are
layed for them by the diuell
this way.
               For if any be ſo ſuſpicious
of himſelfe,Hard to digeſt and vſe proſperitie well. as that hee
take heede he be not lifted
vp, nor made vaine, idle, and
worldly, by growing rich by
his proſperitie, he is a rare
man; the moſt part euen of
ſuch as doe loue the goſpell,
decaying as ſencibly in
grace, as they growe in
wealth: but if the ſame perſon
be as well prepared to
beare aduerſitie, and decay
when God ſhall ſend it, he
may worthily be counted a
rare man, and be marueiled
at, as reſembling the Apoſtle
himſelfe, who had learned
both to abound and to

want, and in euery eſtate to
be contented.Phillip. 4. But the ſinne
is ſo common, I ſay, not for
man to ouer-ſhoot themſelues
this way, but alſo to
be iuſtly offenſiue about
matters of profit, that fewe
ſuſpect themſelues about
their worldly dealings, no
not when they are in great
danger, and haue alſo exceeding
cauſe to accuſe themſelues.
As may appeare in
the example of the Phariſies,Luk. 16. 14.
who when Chriſt reprooued
couetouſnes among
them (teaching that if
a man haue not beene faithfull
in the wicked riches, no
man will truſt him in the
true meaſure) it is ſaid; all
theſe things heard the Phariſies
which were couetous,
and they mocked him. And

while men thinke that Preachers
ſhewe themſelues ridiculous
and worthy to bee
laughed at, for ſpeaking againſt
couetouſnes, it is manifeſt,
that not only they do
not, but alſo that they think
they neede not goe about to
reforme this. For oppreſſion
and deceiuing one another
is ſo well liked, that as
long as they bring in gaine
and commoditie to the
practiſers of them, they regard
not a whit who ſuſteyne
loſſe or ſmart thereby,
or once ſuſpect or feare
that the Lord is prouoked
to reuenge them for their
doings. Oh, therefore how
wiſe is he that is reſolued to
take heede that none ſhall
ſuſteine loſſe by him, but
will ſee that he ſhall haue his

due to the vtmoſt, and (leaſt
this ſhould not be enough)
prouideth ſo, that God may
haue no controuerſie with
him, for and about his earthly
affaires and dealings, nor
any other way!
            
            
               Doct. 10. Sin neuer goeth without company.
               And this reproofe which
the Lord by Samuel layeth
to Saules charge for his couetouſnes
beſides his other
ſinnes, this I ſay teacheth vs,
that ſinne goeth neuer alone
but hath companions, as in
Achans ſinne is to be ſeene,
and in the epiſtle to the Romans,Rom. 13.
where hee ſheweth
how one ſinne leadeth another,
as it were hand in hand:
as gluttonie leadeth drunkennes,
chambering leadeth
wantonnes, and ſtrife enuying:
that no man may reſt in
the common defence and

no leſſe fooliſh then common:
that is this: that when
many are conuicted of their
witting offending of God,
their anſwere is, it was but
that one, with which they
could be charged: and who
is free they aske? whereas
in that they confeſſe one,
they proue themſelues therby,
that they are worthily
put to rebuke, as being guilty
of many: foraſmuch as
one ſinne goeth not alone
without companions. 
                     Vſe. 
                   And
that is a great reaſon why euery
faithfull chriſtian
ſhould beware that he break
not one of the leaſt, of Gods
commandements, looſely or
willingly, ſeeing as he ſhall
thereby be leaſt in the kingdome
of heauen, ſo ſhall not
his ſinne be ſingle and alone,

but accompanied with other
as vile as it ſelfe: as in
the ſinne of adulterie, deceiuing,
malice bearing, and the
like, who can tell how many
noyſome ſinnes accompany
them?
            
            
               Sin would lie hid, if the word did not diſcouer it.
               But to proceede: the
Lord bewraying his ſinne
by Samuell which otherwiſe
ſhould not haue beene
knowne to vs, or any at that
time: doth ſhewe thereby
that much ſinne ſhould be
hidden, and not be knowne
to be ſinne, and conſequently
purged out and abandoned,
if God did not by the
light of his word reueale and
diſcouer it. And being hidden
frommen (when yet it
is greedily and commonly
committed of ſuch as liue
among them) ſhould bring

forth many dangerous and
fearefull fruites, and that
which is not the leaſt of other,
poyſon ſuch as ſee it
committed, but not puniſhed
and diſgraced.
               This is apparant how in
places where the goſpel hath
not beene planted or not receiued,1. The doctrine cleared by inſtances.
and alſo where it is
truely preached: In the firſt
it is cleare, how through ignorance
heatheniſh & monſtrous
ſinnes, not only common
and dayly committed,
are entertained, and cauſe
that no goodnes can be admitted
and take place there.
For who is bolder then the
blinde? By this meanes the
lurking and viperous generation
of the Seminaries carry
numbers into moſt peftilent
errours, and the vnruly

multitude, leade troupes after
them to horrible abhominations.
And ſauour they
neuer ſo much of the faſhions
of the heathens, and be
their prophanenes neuer ſo
groſſe, as ſorceries and
witch-crafts, whoredome
drunkennes and oppreſſion,
may-games, lobbes of miſrule,
and ſuch like, yet doe
they not only preuaile and
beare ſwaye, but leade the
daunce to a thouſand ſilly
ones, who daunce after their
pipe, with many other abhominations
beſides theſe,
vntill the Lord bewray
them by his word; and
make ſome aſhamed of
them that by their good
meanes, other may bee reſtrayned.
               And if outward and open2.
                  
euills be vnknowne to men,
till God by preaching bewray
them, who doubteth
that ſecret ſinne of the heart,
tongue and life are much
more vnknowne, for want
of the word preached? They
that are in hell know no other
heauen, and they that
liue in darknes, knowe no other
light: all colours are alike
with them. So that as
Sauls ſinne of coueting like
Achans, was made manifeſt
by Samuell the Lords Prophet,
which fewe would
haue thought of all others,
to haue beene in him: ſo if
God ſent forth his meſſengers
into the darke corners,
and townes of the world,
they cauſe many to behold
the treacheries which are
wrought againſt God, which

alſo are the bane of many
thouſands of people, though
before they were brought to
light by preaching, men neuer
dreamed of any ſuch
thing. And as they do therby
growe to ſee the wickednes
of others, ſo doe they
come to knowe the many
deformities, blemiſhes, and
ſtaynes, which are in themſelues,
both inward and outward,
which they neuer imagined
to haue beene ſo:
euen as Samaria by Philips
preaching of Chriſt to them,
ſaw Simon Magus ſorceries,
and forſooke them. And this
is done to the end, that ſo
many as the Lord ſhall call,
may be brought by the ſight
of their ſinne to the diſlike
thereof, and ſo to true repentance
and ſaluation: and

the reſt may either bee reſtrayned
from the exceſſe of
euill which before they ran
after, or if they will needes
goe forward, yet they may
haue conſciences wounding
and accuſing them, that ſo
they may ſinne with leſſe
eaſe.
               Now to proue that where
the goſpell is purely preached,Further proofe.
much ſinne is brought
to light, who can be ignorant
of it? for how otherwiſe
could nombers bee
brought to faith and chriſtian
conuerſation, as many
(God bee thanked) dayly
are if they did not ſee their
darknes & vnbeleefe wherein
they lay wrapped before?
And therefore although the
blinde of the world, do moſt
ſcornefully and wilfully caſt

of the Lords yoake, which
is his holy doctrine and
ſcoffe at ſuch as doe ſubmit
themſelues vnto it and receiue
it: yet let all who haue
any eyes to ſee from what
Egyptian darknes and bondage
the Lord hath brought
them by ſending his truth
and word among them, 
                     Vſe. 
                  
which only maketh them
free: let all ſuch [I ſay]
giue moſt hartie thankes to
the Lord for it, and pray for
the continuance of the ſyncere
preaching of it among
them to perfect the worke
of faith which is begunne in
them.

               WE haue heard now,The words opened.
how Samuell tolde
Saul that the Lord was diſpleaſed
with him, for his
falſehood and wicked dealing
about the deſtroying of

the Amalakites. In the next
place Samuell was about to
tell him of the puniſhment
which God threatned him:
but he preuented and cut
him of: whereby it might
haue beene hoped and looked
for, that Saul ſhould
haue beene ſore troubled,
and haue humbled his ſoule
in faſting and prayer before
God, when he ſhould haue
heard his heauie meſſage:
But what doth he? he ſtandeth
moſt impudently in his
owne defence, both againſt
God and his owne conſcience
(for afterward hee
confeſſed the contrary) and
euen as he had done before
when Samuell had firſt told
him the Lords minde: hee
ſaith to the Prophet he had
obeyed the commandement,

ted ſpeaches and multitude
of words, make it appeare
(if it be not well looked into)
to be voyde of blame,
yea, commendable. They
will not (indeede) affirme
that they maintaine ſinne,
and that they will do a thing
though it be euill, (that were
too groſſe, and in ſo doing
they muſt ſhew themſelues
odious to all (which were
no hypocriſie,) and ſo the
impudencie of ſuch, ſeeing
it cannot be hidden, a man
would thinke that ſuch ſins
were like to be the ſooner
repented of, or elſe they muſt
needes liue in contempt in
the world.Math. 21. As wee reade in

being bidden by his father
to goe worke in his vineyarde,
anſwered, hee would

not: but as hee departed,
conſidering the groſſenes of
his diſobedience, he repented
and went. But theſe of
whome I heare ſpeake, call
that good which is euill, that
ſo they may be wel thought
of among men, though they
deſerue the contrary, and
deceiue their owne hearts
with a vaine hope. For they
ſet themſelues to hide their
finne, which is a ſufficient
proofe that they cannot
proſper:Iob. 31. and whatſoeuer
may come againſt them,
they wittingly refuſe to ſee
it, leaſt their conſciences
ſhould pricke and accuſe
them of it: and ſo hardening
their hearts, are farre
from relenting, and to that
end they put away the remembrance
of the euill day

farre from them.
               This appeareth in that
Phariſie, who being beewrayed
by our Sauiour to
be no ſuch as he vainegloriouſly
boaſted himſelfe to
be, did yet iuſtifie himſelfe
and ſay, Lord I thanke thee
that I am not as others.Luk. 18.
whereas the righteous man
is his owne firſt accuſer, yea,
laboureth to ſee his ſecret
ſins, & dares not hide,Prou. 28. 14 them
and ceaſeth not till he renounce
and confeſſe the
ſame that he may finde mercie:
ſo farre is he of from
playing the part of the hypocrites
in ſetting the beſt
ſide outward, and ſeeking to
ſhift, excuſe and defend that
which is euill. And yet I
ſay not that he is vtterly
voyde of hypocriſie, which

aſſaulteth the beſt, but yet he
ſeeth it with deadly diſlike
how it encombereth him,
and (will he nill hee) it doggeth
him, but he makes no
prouiſion to fulfill the deſires
of it, as the other doth,
but groaneth vnder the burthen
of it and of the like
ſinnes, till he teſtifie plainely
that he doth not harbour
them, as may plainely bee
ſeene in the poore Publican.
And who doth not ſee that
he is not the man which is
odious for his ſinne to the
godly that know him, as the
other are approued of them:
whereas they in whom there
is no ſoundnes nor conſcience,
but they are ſlie and
ſlipperie, do diſcredit themſelues,
and are neither in fauour
with God nor men;

but like Gehezai, whoſe
great ſinne although it was
found out of his maſter the
Prophet,2. King. 6. yet when he would
trie what grace there was in
him to confeſſe it, though he
had wickedly committed it,
he boldly and ſhameleſſely
did hide it: and where hee
asked him where hee had
beene, after hee returned
from his horrible facts he
had beene about, he anſwered,
thy ſeruant hath beene
no where, (hee meant but
where he ſhould and might
be, that was about his maſters
buſines,) ſo farre 
                     •
                  he
was of from grace though a
Prophets ſeruant. 
                     Vſe. 
                   Therefore
let euery one that calls on
the name of the Lord leſus
be farre from bold maintaining
of the leaſt ſinne, and

from clearing himſelf when
he is manifeſtly conuicted in
his owne conſcience: for among
all offenders, as ſuch
an one as hideth his finne
ſhall not proſper, ſo he may
be ſure to be excluded from
Gods kingdome, if he abide
in his ſinne. And this is one
of the true markes of an hypocrite,
illuſtrated by the
true contrary properties of
a ſyncere chriſtian, which
two ſhall be alwayes able to
iuſtifie or condemne him,
who will lay his life in the
ballances, and be content to
trie himſelfe as all haue
good cauſe to doe.
            
            
               Doct. 13. The hypocrite pleads excuſe from all blame vnder pretence of any good.
               Now followes the ſecond
note of an hypocrite, no
leſſe needfull to be marked
and regarded then the former,
and that is this. If they

doe any thing that is to be
allowed, vnder the colour of
that, all that they doe muſt
be allowed alſo, and borne
out by that; and whatſoeuer
they cannot iuſtifie, but that
it muſt needs be found fault
with, that they lay vpon others.And deriues that vpon others which hee cannot ſhift off himſelfe.
This is moſt apparantly
to be ſeene in Saul, for
he ſaith he ſlue the Amalakites,
therefore he had walked
in the way, in which the
Lord commanded him: ſo
that ſeeing hee had done
ſomething that God commāded,
therfore by & by he
had done all that he ought:
but he ſaid, ſeeing it could
not but be granted that ſome
part of Gods will was left
vndone by him, namely, the
beſt of the cattle was ſaued
aliue contrary to Gods commandement.

therefore beholde
that he layes vpon the
people.
               
                  The firſt branch.
                  Concerning the firſt
branch of theſe two: how
common is it, though it bee
moſt palpable and groſſe,
that the goodnes which
men doe,One inſtance in the worſt ſort. ſhall be ſpoken of
by them, and ſet forth to the
eyes of the world, as if none
were like to them therein:
neither might any thing be
layd to their charge, how
faulty ſoeuer they be otherwiſe.
Now if any alleadge,
that for all their boaſting of
their goodnes, many abhominations
are in their liues,
they turne all ſuch accuſations
behinde them, with him
who being full of great ſins,
healed vp all with theſe
ſpeaches, I am no adulterer,

I faſt twice in the weeke, I
giue almes, &c. ſo theſe becauſe
they haue ſomwhat to
boaſt of, therefore all their
filthines muſt be forgotten,
though the ſtinch of it annoy
all places about them▪
as is to be ſeene in that anſwere
of Abner, who being
accuſed by poor
                        •
                      
                     Iſhboſheth
for defiling his fathers Concubine,
anſwered:2 Sam. 3. 8. 
                     am I a
dogges head which againſt Iuda
ſhew mercie to the houſe of
Saul, &c? all his ſinne muſt
be couered with the good
ſeruice he had done to Iſhboſheth.
Which, yet take it at
the beſt, was in him none of
the beſt, as his owne words
after declare, in the 9. verſe.
But to returne, the like practiſe
is at this day to be ſeene
in Popery, who vnder a vizoured

colour of holines,
commit all kinde of wickednes:
painted ſepulchres they
are, full of dead mens bones:
particular inſtances are innumerable,
therefore I ſay
no more, for it is but loſt
labour.
                  And I would to God,A ſecond inſtance in common Proteſtāts. this
euill reſted in them; but
(with griefe I ſpeake it) euen
in the land of the righteous,
where God is knowne,Eſay. 26. 10 and
his word preached this iniquitie
is committed, that
vnder a cerimonious and
hollow ſeruing of God,
(which yet is but with lips,
and from teeth outward,)
all loathſome ſins are ſheltred.Math. 15.
For what care or conſcience
of dutie is there in
the moſt, whatſoeuer they
are occupied about, in their

ſpeach or actions, ſaue that
they be of our religion, and
come to Church on the ſabbath,
as others doe? Inſomuch,
as the Prophet Ieremy
who found out this ſinne in
his time, cryed out of ſuch,
that they made the temple
of God,Ierem. 7. 7. a denne of theeues,
and yet they were ſafe (in
their owne imaginacion) for
all their adulteries, ſwearing,
&c. as long as they (after
the committing of them)
came into the Temple to
pray. This is ranke hypocriſie,
[though in ſome
more groſſe, becauſe they
haue more knowledge then
others,] when they leape
thus out of a wicked and
vnreformed life, to boaſt of
aſſurance of ſaluation, and
all becauſe they haue ſomewhat

to glory of, as that they
pray, or giue to the poore,
or doe no man wrong, as
they ſay; when they, who
are the children of God indeed,
doe take ſo ſmall comfort
in this that they doe
ſome duties rightly, that
they can finde no peace, nor
walke cheerefully, whiles
they ſuffer any one ſinne to
haue dominion ouer them,
or to remaine quiet or vnpurſued
in them: And is it
any marueile? ſeeing they
haue learned, that God will
be reuenged on the breach
of euery commandement.Pſal. 119.
They beleeue this, and feare
to doe againſt it, that ſo they
may declare by their practiſe,
that they deſire to beſeeme
the goſpell in all
things,Phil. 1. 27. and that they are according

to Gods owne heart
and liking,Deut. 5. 29. who ſaith, oh
that there were ſuch an heart
in them, that they did feare
mee and keepe all my commandements
alwayes, that
it might go well with them.
                  And as theſe doe highly
pleaſe God, ſo are they on
the contrary moſt odious,
which tie God to his ſtint,
and performe ſome ſlender
taske to him, as to pray in
ceremonie, or heare ſometime,
and to confeſſe with
their mouthes, that we muſt
liue Godly, but are voyd of
the power of godlines in
hart and deed: Such [mark
it who will] ſet not themſelues
to obſerue what is
amiſſe in themſelues, if they
be able to alleadge ſomething
in their owne commendations;

and that they
be not ſo offenſiue and diſobedient,
as many others;
And yet as apparantly as
this kinde of people is abhominable
to God, 
                        Vſe 1 and branded
with the marke of foule
hypocriſie, yet [which is no
leſſe lamentable] how is this
courſe of liuing iuſtified in
the world of the greateſt
part, whereby it is ſo farre of
from being diſgraced and
repented of, that the commonnes
of it, doth bolſter
and maintaine it, and is not
onely checke-mate with ſinceritie
it ſelfe,Note. but croweth
ouer it, and for want of outward
helpe to authoriſe and
grace this ſynceritie and
true godlynes, thruſteth it
to the wall. 
                        Vſe 2 But God that
taketh part with his owne

ordinance, which is the endeauouring
to ſerue him in
all things, and hath commanded
it in Moſes,
                     Numb. 12. 
                     Iob,
                     Iob. 1. 2. 
                     Samuell
and others;1 Sam. 12. 16. and alſo
hath condemned the contrarie
in the whole packe and
rabble of hypocrites,Pſal. 50. 16 will
both bleſſe and be a father
to thoſe which walke after
this rule,1 Pet. 1. 17. and giue them their
portion with the workes of
iniquitie, who haue beene
both practiſers, and thereby
maintainers of this halfe and
counterfeite ſeruing of God,
as farre as they thinke good:
thus deuiding thoſe things
moſt groſſely which God
hath ioyned together; for
that ſuch (I ſpeake of the
greateſt number) doe know
that they doe wickedly in
thus liuing, heereby it is

manifeſt, when they are conuinced
by ſtrong arguments,
that their halfe ſeruing of
God is an abhomination to
him, they haue no better euaſion
then this, who can
liue thus? and that it is impoſſible:
which anſwere denyeth
not, but that God requireth
ſuch a courſe and
ſuch a manner of liuing, but
they finde it to croſſe their
will, and rebellious hart, and
to cut them off from many
of their vnlawfull liberties,
which they will not part
from; and therefore they
hold on in their cuſtome
and old manner ſtill, wittingly
and willingly reſiſting
God; come of it what
will.
               
               
                  The ſecōd branch of the doctrine.
                  Another thing there is in
this anſwere of Saul, well

worth the marking: and that
is a neere companion with
the former,The hypocrite deriues his ſinne vpon others. and an other
true worke of an hypocrite:
that in ſuch acts as had bene
done of him, contrary to the
charge that God gaue him,
and the Prophet did euidently
conuince him of diſobedience
theretoo, ſo as he
could not denie it: there he
waſhed his hands, though
he was deepeſt in the fault,
and layd it vpon others:
ſaying, the people did it, as
though they would haue
done that without him: and
beſides the Prophet did
charge him perſonally, with
the very ſame thing, ſaying,
why haſt thou diſobeyed
the voyce of the Lord, and
turned to the ſpoyle? ſo that
it was hee, howſoeuer the

people agreed to him which
doth bewray another dangerous
thing in mens liues,
who are yet members of the
viſible Church of God. that
as they care not how negligent
and ſlacke they bee in
obeying God, nor how ſmall
and meane ſeruice they giue
him, ſo yet if they be ſo vrged
with ſome of their doings,
that they cannot defend
them to be good, yet
how many excuſes will they
haue to free themſelues by
from blame? and to make a
foule fault ſeeme ſmall or
none at all, to cleere themſelues,
though neither cleanly
nor truly:1 Sam. 19. 17. and all, that
they may not be charged,
vpon whomſoeuer it light:
In which kinde of dealing,
as they are neuer the more

diſcharged before God (no
nor for the moſt part before
the world] yet thus they
loue to deceiue themſelues,
& ſuffer the deuill to blindfold
them heereby, and ſo
make a cuſtome of ſinning,
till it be moſt hard to draw
them out of it: Farre are
ſuch of, we ſee, from accuſing
themſelues: and therefore
farre from the eſtate of
righteous men, ſeeing the
righteous is his owne firſt
accuſer. And although no
man ought to accuſe himſelfe
when hee is innocent,
no more then he is bound to
offer himſelfe to the croſſe
and affliction, which God
doth not lay vpon him; yet
when a man knoweth himſelfe
to be guilty and faulty,
and will not ſee but hideth

                     
                        〈1 page missing〉
                     
commeth, weariſome and
tedious to you, while you
liue merrily? for in affliction,
how many of you hold
your confidence in Chriſt,
which at other times commonly
ye bragge of? nay,
doe you not then feare he
loueth you not, but is angry
with you? and why? euen
for that you cannot but remember,
that in time paſt
you haue hidden your ſinne,
and by excuſes made it ſeem
no fault or ſin, leaſt it ſhould
haue troubled you, and haue
cauſed you to leaue and forſake
it, which was as ſugar
vnder your tongue: euen
this excuſing of faults is the
bane of the ſoule; for that
emboldneth men to ſinne,
which otherwiſe durſt not:
for did men ſee that others

knew how bad their liues
are, would they not be aſhamed,
and couer their faces;
who now are bold to
doe whatſoeuer euill liketh
them, becauſe they thinke
they are not ſeene of men;
and therefore when God
plucketh all maskes from
their eies, and arreſteth them
on their bedds or otherwiſe,
woundeth and pierceth
them with deepe ſorrowes,
then they finde it to be with
them, (as this Saul did oft,
and namely in cap. 18.) to
wit, they are almoſt in deſperation.
Therefore let us
feare to flie to ſuch deceiuable
ſhiftes, and when we lay
the blame on others men,
which is due to vs, know we,
that we ſhall be cleared before
God, no better, nor

otherwiſe then Adam was,
when he anſwered, the woman
which thou gaueſt me,
ſhe cauſed me to eate.
                  
                     A further explication of the 2. branch.Now more particularly
let vs ſee by whome he excuſed
himſelfe, and that was
by the people, they (he ſaith)
reſerued ſome of the cattle.
But will any man thinke
that the people were not
ſubiect vnto him, but he rather
vnto them? we ſee how
he commanded the people
in a ſmall thing,1 Sam. 14. and yet too
ſtrictly and cruelly, when
they were faint by purſuing
their enemies, and for all that
none durſt diſobey him, no
namely, that they ſhould not
ſo much as taſte of a little
honey, when it would haue
ſtrengthened and refreſhed
them, and haue made them

fitter to goe againſt their enemies,
ſo great awe he had
them in: And therefore
ſmall likelyhood there was
heere, notwithſtanding his
charging them that they
had reſerued of the cattle
againſt his will: that was
therefore a ſleight excuſe,
and had little truth in it. And
by this we may learne; that
men to ſhunne blame and
puniſhment for their, ſinne,
care not vpon whome they
lay the fault, nor who ſmart,
ſo as they may eſcape and
goe free: though they deſerue
no ſuch thing. A common
fault in the world, that
men can be content that other
ſhall ſuffer for their offences,
as many a one is ſeen
to be hanged for the treſpaſſe,
which another is guiltie

of. This was farre from
Dauid, when the peſtilence
was on the people for his
numbring of them.1 Sam. 14. The godly man beareth his owne burden. He ſaid
vnto the Lord, when he ſaw
the Angell ſmite the people,
behold, I haue ſinned and
done wickedly, but theſe
ſheepe, what haue they
done? Let thine hand [I
pray thee] be againſt mee
and my fathers houſe. Euen
ſo Paul wiſhed in his bonds,
that all were as he; that is
true chriſtians, but without
his bands: he could willingly
wiſh them the commoditie,
that he himſelfe enioyed,
but without the ſmart that
he ſufteyned. And ſo an vpright
hearted chriſtian, cannot
finde in his heart to ſuffer
another man to beare his
burthen; nor to ſmart for

his fault, neither hath any
pleaſure to eaſe himſelfe by
other mens paine; and ſorrow.
Rather he beareth the
burthens of others, then diſburthens
himſelfe vpon the
innocent. So neither can he
hurt, wrong, and oppreſſe
another for his owne benefite,
much leſſe then can, or
dare he liue by the ſinnes of
other men, as many doe; nor
pill, oppreſſe, defraud the
poore, with hard impoſitions,
racked rents; hard penny
worths, when he knoweth
they cannot beare them,
but muſt needes faint and
ſhrinke vnder their burthens.
Alas what comfort
can a man take in the commoditie
that hee wringeth
from the poore! who ſhould
relieue, and giue to him 
                        ••
                     
                     ther;

And yet behold, there
is no difference betwixt
poore and rich made, ſo as
they who deale with them,
may haue aduantage by
them. Heerein men are like
vnto Saul, who falſely accuſed
the people, of that which
he himſelfe was guilty of,
and made them tranſgreſſors,
whereas himſelfe had
faulted and deſerued the puniſhment.
But let vs beare
our owne burden, and bee
not ſo hard harted, as to
hurt the innocent.

               Doct. 14. Hypocrites extenuate their ſinne. THE THIRD SERMON.
               
               
                  VERSE. 21.
                  But the people tooke of the
ſpoile, ſheepe and oxen, the
chiefe of the things which
ſhould haue beene vtterly deſtroyed,
to ſacrifice vnto the
LORD thy God in Gilgal.
               
               SAul knowing himſelfe
faultie in that which he
layed to the people:
doth make light of it. It teacheth
vs, when the hypocrites
conſcience is accuſed
and found guilty, it doth

what it can to extenuate the
ſinne, and make it ſeeme nothing.
The reaſon is, becauſe
it is not repented of, but the
offender purpoſeth to lye
ſtill in it: and while it is ſo,
he loueth not to heare it
made odious, and to be aggrauated,
whereas they, who
turne to God in truth, aggrauate
it to the vtmoſt that
they can, and why ſo? ſurely
becauſe they neuer purpoſe
to commit, or to haue
to doe with it any more, as
we ſee in Dauid,
                  Pſal. 51. 2. and in Paul.
In all this,1. Tim. 1. 15 
                  Saul knew hee
ſpake vntruly: for the cattle
was not reſerued to bee offred
in ſacrifice, but as Samuell
charged him, to his owne
vſe; and yet when he ſawe
no other way to make his
part good, he did it by a lie,

which he thought could not
be knowne: It teacheth vs
that he who dareth doe euill
and ſinne againſt his conſcience,And (if need be) hide it with a lie.
will (if he be put to it)
hide his ſinne with a lie. As
we ſee it is bred in nature to
doe ſo, for little children if
they be charged with a fault,
will make it away with a lye.
But what lye made Saul? I
ſay a cunning lye, that Samuell
could not knowe, except
God had reuealed it to
him: For who knew what he
meant to doe, but himſelfe?
yet ſome lyes others know
to be lyes, and are (as other
fruites of the fleſh) manifeſt.Gal. 6.
               
            
            
               Doct. 15. The multude conſenteth in euill, without any ſcruple.
               But to leaue Saul a little,
becauſe I ſpake of his ſhifting
before, and to come to
the people, though it bee

cleare that his fault was
great in this matter, yea, and
cheefe, yet we ſee how readily
the people, as it were
with one voyce, conſent to
him, and become partakers
of his ſinne, whatſoeuer the
Lord by the Prophet had
charged to the contrary: but
if any obiect, how did the
people know that there was
any ſuch charge giuen of
God by the Prophet of killing
the Amalakites? I anſwere,
it was giuen openly
not ſecretly, when Samuell
met Saul ſo that who would
might heare it: beſides Saul
went about it immediately,
gathering the people together,
for that purpoſe, and
therefore they could not
chuſe, but know why they
came together; and did beginne

in good manner, to
execute the ſaid charge, in
killing the people and deſtroying
the cattle, but yet
they conſented to the ſauing
of the beſt of them, contrary
to the expreſſe commandement
of the Lord, which
was, that they ſhould deſtroy
them all; ſo eaſie a
matter it is to conſent and
agree together in euill that
many ſhall be as one man in
the executing of the ſame.
               Which, if it were but in
ſome one inſtance, or few,
the leſſe might be ſaid,Proofes hereof by ſcripture. of it.
But in what (almoſt) ſhall
ye finde it otherwiſe?Gen. 18. For
proofe by enumeracion of
many particulars. When the
Angels of God came to deſtroy
Sodome, ſeparating
Lot and his houſhold, who

beleeued it and therefore regarded
it? Yea, rather did
they not all mocke at his
words, reſiſt and oppoſe
themſelues. againſt Gods
meſſage, till they were ſmitten
blinde, inſomuch that
his kinſemen whome hee
would haue perſwaded in
more eſpecial manner, jeſted
and derided him for his labour?
and in the abſence of
Moſes 40.Exod. 32. dayes from the
people, how did they conſent
together to make a molten
Calfe, and to daunce before
it committing idolatry
with it? inſomuch that they
compelled Aaron himſelfe
to yeild vnto them. And
when the poſterity of that
people, many hundreth
yeares after, was ſet on a
m
                     •
                  dde moode, to forſake

the ordinance of God, in
being ruled by Iudges, as
they had a long time beene,
but would haue a King to
rule ouer them, as other nations
had: who might diſſwade
them from it? were
there any of themſelues
heard to quiet and pacifie
the mindes of the reſt, and
to hold them in obedience
to the commandement of
God? inſomuch as when
Samuell was ſent from God
to forbid them,1. Sam. 8. yea, and if
they needs would haue their
wil to tell them, they ſhould
pay deare for it, was there
any tribe or family that deſiſted
and kept ſilence, that
the Prophet might carry the
names of ſuch before the
Lord? no: but one was as
another, yea, they knotted

and banded themſelues againſt
the meſſage, till God
from heauen by an vnwonted
thunder and tempeſt,
extraordinarily, euen in their
wheat-harueſt, when the aire
was ſtill, and the weather
faire, flayted and terrefied
them, and made them to ſee
their boldnes, and wilfull
diſobedience, and to confeſſe
that they had ſinned,
and eſpecially in asking
themſelues a King.Iob. 1. And
therefore God bringeth in
Iob, as an odde man among
other, that when the people
went as a ſtreame after euill,
he with-drew himſelfe and
depar
                     •
                  ed from it. Haſt thou
conſidered my ſeruant Iob
ſaith the Lord to Sathan,
how he feareth God and departeth
from euill: for the

multitude runneth headlong
to ſinne, it is agreeable to
their nature; and whereas
the well ordering of the
heart, and good gouernment
of the ſoule is the light of
the whole life, to direct it aright,
as the eye is the light
of the body to carry it: all
ſuch light and ſpirituall gouernment
of the ſoule, is for
the moſt part farre of from
the people, and therefore the
way of truth they cannot
follow, but runne together
to that which blinde reaſon
and the luſt of the heart leadeth
them vnto.
               And this is the cauſe why
at this day there is ſuch an
vniuerſall conſent,And by experience. almoſt in
all places, to that which is
euill. For although through
Gods mercy, light is come

into the world, yea, to this
Land, and the bleſſed goſpell,
and glad tydings of ſaluation
is reuealed, maintained,Io. 3. 16.
and by his Maieſties
highnes, defended amongſt
vs, and by his royall authority
& commandment preached
thorough his dominion,
yet as it is ſaid, men loue
darkenes more then light,
becauſe their deeds are euill:
and hereby it is that inferior
magiſtrates in many places,
doe not countenance and
further the ſyncere preaching
of it, incouraging (as
they ought with all their abillity)
both preacher and
people, but rather iuſtle it
out from among them, and
content themſelues with the
bare reading of the ſcriptures.
And heere of it is that

the miniſters themſelues,
who haue not the power of
the goſpell working in them,
and ſubduing themſelues,
and therefore louing profit,
pleaſure, and preferment
more then godlines; cannot,
nor will not take paines to
enlighten and reforme others,
and to beate downe
the workes of darknes, and
of the diuell among them.
And heereof conſequently
it ariſeth; that the people remaine
in ignorance and
bondage to their euill luſts.
More particularly to come
nearer to our ſelues: hereof
it is that common diſcorders,
and open abominations
remaine among vs, now
after 60. yeares preaching in
this land, which ſhould bee
the Land of the righteous:

and hereby it is, that heatheniſh
games, lobbes of
miſrule, with money dauncings,
are ſtill retayned in
ſome parts of it, with Atheiſme
& groſſe prophanenes,
yea, euen on the ſabboth
it ſelfe, and that in time of
diuine ſeruice, prayer and
preaching, are by troupes
and companiſhips practiſed,
and defended. And the
groſſeſt ſinnes, as popery,
adultery, drunkennes, oppreſſing,
deceiuing, haue ſo
many fauorites with like abhomination:
that it may
cleerely be ſeen, there wants
no conſent in any of them,
but the practiſers are ſo many
and well knowne, that as
all trades in London of any
reckoning, haue their companies
which profeſſe, maintaine

and liue by them, as
the company of Mercers,
the company of Goldſmithes,
Merchant Taylors,
Drapers and the like: ſo ye
may reckon vp in all kindes
of ſinne among vs, (ſuch is
the conſent therein, and ſo
great and common are the
fellowſhips of them; the
comepany of whoremongers,
the companie of Idolaters,
the company of
theeues, the company of
malice bearers, the company
of ſlaunderers and lyars,
with ſuch a rabble of many
others; that yee may ſee
conſent and companie enough
in euery kinde of ſin.
Oh, it cannot be expreſſed,
how ſoone one followeth another
in euill? and how
ſoone one conſenteth to another

in his ſinne: yea, and
that which is an increaſe of
this ſinne, and filleth the
world with ſin, ſo are theſe
companyſhipps in diuerſe
kindes of ſinne; not only
firme and ſure in themſelues,
but ſo alyed and neare a
kinne one to another, that if
one of them were too weake
alone by himſelfe, to ſtand
and vphold it ſelfe, yet it
ſhould bee vpholden and
ſtrengthened by another.
               And if the power of the
word of God were ſo entertained
and embraced in any
place, citie, or towne, that
it were like to breake of any
part of bad fellowſhip in any
one kinde of ſinne, all
the reſt are ready to band
themſelues together againſt
that preaching to vphold any

ſinne, or company onſhip
which were falling and decaying:
the ryotous will
helpe to vphold the couetous,
and the mallicious, the
flatterer, and the proud will
plead for the vſurer, and one
for another, to deface the
preacher, though one haue
no great conuerſing with the
other, but rather ſome way,
nipping the other ſecretly;
that as Herod and Pilate
were at contention one with
another, yet could both ſet
themſelues againſt Chriſt:
ſo can the carnall proteſtant,
ioyne himſelfe with the
Church papiſt, to rayle on,
and deface the effectuall and
powerfull preaching of
Chriſt, and the zealous profeſſors
of it: yea, I ſay more
ſuch force hath conſent in

ſinne, to worke miſchiefe,
and to infect where it goeth,
that it faſtneth euen vpon
ſuch, as haue ſhewed ſome
good countenance to the
goſpell, and haue beene
iudged to loue it from their
hearts: ſo truly it is ſaid of
our Sauiour, that the abundance
of iniquitie, cauſeth
the loue of many, to waxe
cold: for when one ſeeth
another take a courſe, that
liketh fleſh, and the ſame to
be allowed and maintained,
by many, what grace haue
the beſt chriſtians neede of,
to keepe themſelues in, that
they walke not after the ſame
exceſſe of ryot, that others
doe? and what is there to
hold men in, but the preaching
of the goſpell, from
prophanenes? & from much

looſenes, ignorance and diſſolutenes
thereby? And yet
few haue that ſounding in
their eares, eſpecially in any
great power, and yet where
it hath any, it is ſoone reſiſted
and beaten backe. What
is then to be done, but that
ſuch as haue eares to heare,
(knowing this) take heede
to themſelues, and follow
not the multitude to doe euill,
but depart from the
ſteppes, companies and acquaintance
of ſuch, and ſay
with the valiant man Ioſuah,
though there bee neuer ſo
many of them, yet I and
mine, will feare the Lord.
               
               
                  VERSE. 22.23.
                  
                     And Samuell ſaid, Hath the
LORD as great delight in
burnt offerings and ſacrifices,
as in obeying the voyce
of the LORD? Behold, to
obey, is better then ſacrifice:
and to hearken, then the fat
of rammes.
                  
                  For rebellion is as the ſinne of
witchcraft, and ſtubburnneſſe
is as iniquitie and idolatrie:
becauſe thou haſt rejected
the word of the
LORD, he hath alſo rejected
thee from being king.
               
               WEe haue heard Sauls
anſwere,The ſentence therof.
wherein he
would haue couered the
fault (which hee could not
denie altogether) ſaying, it

was to honour God which
they did: meaning the
beaſtes were reſerued, to be
offered to him for ſacrifice,
and therefore the fault (he
hoped) was not great; for
he had (he ſaid) obeyed the
Lord, & gon the way which
he had commanded him.
This anſwer therefore of his,
in both points the Prophet
ſheweth to be but gloſing,
and dawbing with vntempered
mortar, and therefore
not able to ſtand him in any
ſtead. For know ſaith he,
that as concerning the ſacrifice
which thou ſpeakeſt of,
if thou haddeſt meant indeed
to haue offred it to the
Lord (which yet thou diddeſt
not, but reſerued the
beaſts as a pray to thine own
behoofe) yet if thou haddeſt

meant to offer them for ſacrifice,
the Lord will take no
ſuch offring, as is ioyned
with diſobeying him, as that
ſhould haue beene; but hee
looketh that his commandement
ſhould be obeyed.
This is the firſt part of his
replie or reproofe, when he
ſaith, hath the Lord as great
pleaſure in burnt offrings, as
that his voyce ſhould be obeyed?
no: but I tell thee,
to giue eare is better then ſacrifice,
and to harken to his
commandement is better
then the fatte of rammes. In
the ſecond part of his ſpeach
vnto him, he tells him, that
as light as he made of his
fault, it was witting diſobedience
and rebellion againſt
the Lords commandement,
and that was euen as witchcraft

in his ſight, or as the
committing of Idolatrie.
               Therefore in this replie of
Samuell vpon Sauls anſwer,
he layeth out Sauls ſinne of
diſobedience in this verſe
and the next, and then tells
him of the puniſhment
which God had threatned againſt
him, and that is in the
end of it. His diſobedience,
becauſe he made light of it,
ſeeing God (he ſaid) was to
be ſerued in offring that cattle
to him for ſacrifice, for
the reſeruing the which aliue,
he was challenged: this
his diſobedience (I ſay) Samuell
aggrauateth, and maketh
odious to him comparatiuely.
Firſt by it and ſacrifice
together, and ſhewing
that God did nothing
account of that, as to bee

obeyed, but preferreth obedience
before it. Secondly,
he aggrauatet
                     •
                   his diſobedience
by a reaſon; comparing
it with witchcraft and Idolatrie,
and maketh it like to
them. And this of the ſinne
of this verſe. Now, next he
ſheweth what the puniſhment
was, and that was the
loſſe of his kingdome. Both
theſe Samuell ſtandeth vpon
with Saul, to the end he
might rouſe him vp, and awake
him: for wee ſee that
he was, as one in a dead
ſleep, who ſtirred not a whit
at Samuels calling and crying
to him hitherto. But
when he rung this alarom in
his eares, of the greatnes of
his ſinne, and of the loſſe of
his kingdome, this (I ſay)
awoke him, as it appeareth in

the next verſe following.
And this of Samuells words
to Saul in theſe two verſes,
where we ſee he beginneth
with an interrogation, that
he might make his meſſage
more forcible, ſaying, hath
God as great, &c.
               But now ſeeing Samuell
maketh his compariſon,A clearing of the compariſon. betwixt
obedience on the one
part, and ſacrifice and burnt
offrings on the other, ſomewhat
is to bee ſaid of theſe
two, for the better vnderſtanding
of the place, which
otherwiſe hath ſome difficultie,
by meanes whereof,
we ſhould not ſee the doctrine,
that is affoorded vs
therein: A ſacrifice (to beginne
with that) was an holy
thing brought by him that
gaue it to the Lord, and

offred by the Prieſt vnto the
Lord, according to the Law.
But there being two kindes
of them, the one propitiatorie,
whereby they beleeued
the forgiuenes of ſinne by
Chriſt, which was figured
thereby: The other Euchariſticall
by offring whereof
they teſtified their thanks to
God, for benefites receaued
of him. Both were commanded
by God, and burnt
offrings were one kinde;
The firſt, wherein that which
was offred was wholy the
Lords, and did ſignifie that
he who offred it, did wholy
conſecrate himſelfe, ſoule
and body to the Lord. Now
theſe all being commanded
by God, muſt needs be therfore
accepted of him, which
being ſo, why was not the

offring of them accounted
obedience? For the anſwering
of this doubt, three
things are to bee marked.
Firſt, if obedience to the
morrall law, and ſacrifice
might goe together, they
were both accepted. Secondly,
if they could not go
together, (as oft times it fell
out they did not; for he that
was obedient could not alwayes
offer ſacrifice, and
one might offer ſacrifice,
who yet was not obedient
to God) in ſuch a caſe, obedience
was accepted of
God without ſacrifice.
Thirdly, ſacrifice might bee
offred by him who obeyed
not God, but that neuer
pleaſed God. Of this Samuell
ſpeaketh here, obedience
is better then ſacrifice: and

if Saul and the people meant
to offer any (as he ſaid they
purpoſed to doe) it was nothing
being without obedience,
and yet this is the moſt
and the beſt, that could bee
ſaid of it. So that, obedience
being better then ſacrifice
at the beſt; euen when
both went together: much
more is it better, when ſacrifice
goeth alone.
            
            
               
                  Doct. 16. Sacrifice pleaſeth not God without obedience.
               This being thus ſaid,
which was neceſſary,
let Samuells words [hath the
Lord as great pleaſure in ſacrifice,
as that his voice
ſhould be obeyed?) teach
vs, that the moſt religious
actions that God requireth
(ſuch as ſacrifices were) as
prayer, hearing the word,
the vſe of the Sacraments,
&c. are in no account with

God, if he that vſe them be
not obedient in his life to
the cōmandements of God
and a repentant Chriſtian.
A wonderfull and fearefull
doctrine (yet moſt true, for
this our age, wherein ſo few
are, or thinke it meete they
ſhould be obedient to the
truth in particular, which is
taught them, and haue nothing
to commend them
vnto God, vnleſſe it bee the
ceremonious worſhipping
of God, in the manner I
haue mencioned, a ſeruice
not better then the offring
of ſacrifice, which (we ſee)
without obedience was nothing
worth. Indeed the Apoſtle
Iohn ſaith,Reuel. 1. 3.
bleſſed is
he that heareth and readeth,
and keepeth the contents of
that booke, but not he that

heareth and readeth only,
but that keepeth it alſo. So
then, this obedience to
Gods will, is not to be compared
with ſacrifices, but to
be preferred farre before
them: ſacrifices were offrings
to God which were
commanded, but ſo as they
offred them in faith and repentance
alſo: but obedience
is the fruite of both,
therefore to bee preferred;
The Lord tels the Iſraelites,
I required no ſacrifices of
your fathers, after that I
brought them out of Egypt
(meaning after that in Sinai)
but that they ſhould obey
my voyce,Deut. 4. 6. and that is our
wiſdome,Rom. 2. 28.
ſo he is not a Iew
which is one outwardly.
Therfore our outward worſhip
is nothing, if the heart

goe not with it: whatſoeuer
men anſwere in their defence,
if they obey not,
prayer is nothing cap. 13.13
we hold the generall, but the
particular, we looke not vnto,
for then our hearts
ſhould be taken vp wholy in
one dutie after another,
which now is ſcarcely done
in any, to purpoſe. And it
is called obedience of faith,
ſeeing we muſt beleeue that
God requireth a thing of vs,
before we can, or will do it.
But men deale with God, as
one with another, for they
cogge and deceiue, and time
muſt waſh it away, and then
good fellowſhip againe, ſo
they diſobey God, and after
they would be friends again
with him.The doctrine more fully opened.
               
               Out of the prophets words

in this verſe and the next,
namely the 23. wee may
learne in what deteſtable account
all diſobedience is to
the commandement and reuealed
will of God, and
withall, how we ſhould cenſure
ſuch diſobedience, and
thinke of it in our ſelues. In
what deteſtation mens ſinne
is with God, howſoeuer
they couer it, and whatſoeuer
colours or pretences
they ſet vpon it, the words
(I ſay) ſhew ſufficiently,
when the prophet ſaith, hath
the Lord as great pleaſure
in burnt offrings, as that his
voyce ſhould bee obeyed?
againe, where he compareth
his diſobedience to rebellion
and witchcraft. The prophet
Eſay doth in the firſt
chapter, in moſt odious

manner reprooue the people
though they offred to
the Lord ſacrifice, ſeeing
they were diſobedient.Eſay 1. Doe
you offer to mee the multitude
of your ſacrifices? I am
full of your burnt offrings
ſaith the Lord: I haue no
pleaſure in the blood of
your lambes and goates; and
that ye come to appeare before
mee, who required this
at your hands? with many
like ſpeaches: and yet wee
know as hath bene ſaid, that
God commanded all ſuch
things. But why then doth
he thus refuſe them at their
hands? and ſay he will ſhut
his eyes when they ſtretch
out their hands vnto him,
and when they poure out
many prayers vnto him, he
will not heare them? This

he ſaith vnto them, not ſimply,
becauſe hee did diſlike
the things themſelues, but
for that their workes were
euil who offred theſe things,
and they did not obey the
Lord in other things, which
he commanded them: and
therfore he ſaith, waſh you,
make you cleane, take away
the euill of your workes
from before mine eyes, and
ceaſe to doe euill, or elſe offer
me none of your prayers
nor ſacrifice: ſuch a thing it
is to diſobey the commandements
of God, that they
which doe ſo, although they
ſhould offer to God their
prayers and praiſes, and partake
the word and Sacraments,Ioh. 9.
yet he will not accept
them at their hands, but caſt
them backe in their faces, as

dunge, as not heere only,
but in many other places he
bewrayeth his vtter deteſtation
of ſuch kinde of worſhipping
him: but behold
now he goeth further in diſgracing
diſobedience, for he
ſaith, it is as witchcraft and
Idolatrie:Pſal. 50. 16 ſo in Pſal. 50. he
maketh it odious ſaying,
what haſt thou to do to take
my name into thy mouth,
and hateſt to be reformed?
And in the Prouerbs,Prou. 28. 7. he that
turneth away his eare from
hearing the Law, euen his
prayer is an abhominacion
vnto the Lord. With which,
agreeth that of the Apoſtle
to the Romans, he is not a
Iewe, which hath the outward
circumciſion in the
fleſh, but inward,Rom 2 28. in the
heart. Out of all which it

is cleere and euident, that if
a man be not vnfainedly reſolued
to bee ſubiect vnto
God, and obedient to his
will, in vaine doth he make a
ſhew and profeſſion therof.
Now to bee obedient in
ſome things, and in other to
be vndutifull (wee know) is
no obedience, but contempt
of God, for which cauſe
Saint Iames ſaith,Iam. 2. 10.
                  he that keepeth
the whole Law, and breaketh
any one point of it is guilty
of all: for he that will be vnconſcionable
in one, declareth
that he dare prouoke
God, and ſet light by his authoritie
in other points, who
gaue him his Law: and if he
dare tranſgreſſe in one, and
take libertie therein to himſelfe,
who doubteth but hee
will do the ſame in another?

ſo that he, that is not affraid
to offend in one thing, euen
the leaſt, knowing it to be eeuil,
may wel be ſaid to haue
no feare to offend in any of
all, no not the greateſt.
               So truly hath our Sauiour
giuen teſtimony to this ſaying,Luk. 16. 10.
                  He that is faithfull in the
leaſt, is faithfull alſo in much,
and he that is vniuſt in the
leaſt, is vniuſt in much. So
neceſſarily hath God ioyned
the obeying of one with
the obeying of the reſt; and
the renouncing of one ſinne
with the renouncing of all
other, (as he ſaith by ſaint
Iames,Iam. 2.11. 
                  he that ſaid, thou ſhalt
not commit adulterie, ſaid alſo,
thou ſhalt not kill: now though
thou doeſt none adulterie, yet
if thou killeſt thou art a tranſgreſſor
of the Law. This is

not alleadged by the Apoſtle,
nor mencioned by mee,
as though we affirmed that
any man can keepe the Law,
or all the commandements
except ſome one; but to
teach, that there is no carefull
obeying of one, in him
who hath not care, and doth
not endeauour to obey all:
and ſo doe all other ſcriptures
meane, when they require
obedience, as well as
this preſent text of ours,
they require it in one part of
the commandement as well
as in another, and not generally,
but particularly, neither
in one, or ſome fewe,
but in all.
               For elſe we might endeauour
to ſerue God in ſomethings,
and diſobey him in
others, which were an abuſing

of the doctrine of the
holy profeſſion of the goſpell:
which if it be ſo, then
it followeth, that all which
worſhip God outwardly,
and would be taken to be
religious, and looke not to
their particular wayes, are
deceiued and lie ſtill in darknes,
and God they pleaſe
not, but ſhall be challenged
of him, for workers of iniquitie:
which the more I
conſider, the more I marueile
at it, becauſe the greateſt
part take no knowledge
of any ſuch thing: for they
that draw themſelues from
nothing that they luſt after,
neither feare to offend before
they do euill, nor tremble
for it when they haue
done, euery one ſaying,
what haue I done? If they

quarrell, braule, reuenge,
deceiue, ſlaunder, lie, maintaine
ſinne in other, or doe
any ſuch like ſinne, it is but
their ordinarie and common
courſe. It is rare with them
to be pricked in conſcience,
for any thing they doe amiſſe;
and as for the outward
ſeruice, the Lord is not
pleaſed with it, when his
voyce is not obeyed: as the
prophet Micah ſaid vnto
them who bare great ſhews,Micah. 6. 6.
yet they ſought to pleaſe
God, enquiring thus;
Wherwith
ſhall wee appeare before
the Lord, and bow our ſelues
before the high God? ſhall we
come before him with burnt
offrings, will the Lord be pleaſed
with thouſands of rammes,
or with tenne thouſand riuers
of oyle? ſhall wee giue our

firſt borne for our tranſgreſſion,
euen the fruite of our
body, for the ſinne of our
ſoule? The Prophet anſwereth,
he hath ſhewed thee (O
man) what the Lord requireth,
and what is good, ſurely
to doe iuſtly and to loue mercy,
and to humble thy ſelfe to
walke with thy God.
               
               Which plainely teacheth
vs,Vſe both of reproofe. that if men muſt bee ſo
farre from committing wickednes,
that it is required of
all that will pleaſe God, to
obey him in the duties of
both tables, how farre are
they out of fauour with
him, who in ſtead of obeying
in both, doe groſſely and
wittingly diſobey in both?
and repent of neither. And
if they be not in fauour with
God who offend thus as I

haue ſaid, that is who regard
not to pleaſe God in
all things,Coloſ. 1. 10. euen one as another:1. Pet. 4. 4.
where ſhall they appeare,
who defend that they
neede not doe ſo? yea, raile
on ſuch as dare not goe ſo
farre as they in ſinning; bayting
them with the odious
name of Puritane, ſeeing they
make ſome conſcience of
ſinne, and deſire to offer obedience
to God, in one
part of their life, as well as
in another, and thinke their
prayers, hearing and confeſſion
of ſin, to be to ſmall
purpoſe without it. How
vnlike are ſuch to them, who
hauing but ſome one ſinne,
(as anger) to encounter
ſpecially; yet cannot bee
quiet for that one? And this
is their wiſdom if they haue

any, thus to walke, and not
with the fooliſh virgins to
haue their lamps, but no oile
in them▪ and ſo are all taught
of God by Moſes,
                  Deut. 4.
who ſaith:
Behold, I haue taught you ordinances
and lawes, which the
Lord my God commanded me,
that yee ſhould doe euen ſo, in
the land whether yee goe to
poſſeſſe it: keepe them therefore
and doe them; for it is
your wiſdome and your vnderſtanding
in the ſight of the
people, which ſhall heare all
theſe ordinances, and ſhall ſay
this people is wiſe, and of an
vnderſtanding heart.
               
               And if they be wiſe who
obey them (the Lord himſelf
being judge) let them,1. Cor. 1. 18 who
ſo taunt the godly, lead ſuch
with the name of fooles, till
God bewray themſelues to

be rank fooles, becauſe they
cannot become ſuch fooles
alſo, that they may be wiſe.
And let vs beare reproach at
their hands,And of encouragement.
ſeeing God calleth
vs wiſe, and let not vs
faint in our courſe, for their
ſpeaking againſt vs; for ſurely,
no ſuch (nay I may ſay,
few of all the greateſt number
of profeſſors) do in any
other manner then generally
and in words only, hold
that we ſhould offer to the
Lord obedience, but as for
the obſeruing of our wayes
particularly to ſee that they
pleaſe God,Prou. 4. 18
or the keeping
of our hearts with all diligence,
that our liues may be
ſutable (as the wiſe man
ſpeaketh) they hold it as a
thing meerely ridiculous:
for then ſhould they ſee

cauſe (as others doe whom
they count fooles,) to looke
to the particulars, and to one
part of their liues as to another,
and to be taken vp in
their conſultacions and
thoughts, how in one duty
as well as in another they
might pleaſe God; whereas
now they ſhew, that al is too
little to pleaſe themſelues.
But ſuch deale with God, as
i
                     •
                   neighbours deale one with
another; for they cogge, miſuſe,
and deceiue one another,
till they breake out into debate
and contention, & hard
thinking one of another, and
then time & a little abſcence,
muſt waſh away diſpleaſure:
and ſo they winde in together
againe, and are good fellowes
and friends: So men
deale with God: for if the

hardeſt fall out with them as
they count it, that by the
light of preaching they muſt
needes ſee, that they are
ſhamefully out of the way,
(which they will not bee
brought to acknowledge for
their common faults & ſins)
but yet if they muſt needes
ſee their liues foulely out of
order, and that thereby God
is ſore diſpleaſed with them,
at the hardeſt, if they come
to Church, and there doe as
others; they thinke they
ought to be receiued into fauour
with God, and their ſins
muſt be forgiuen them, and
all muſt take them for good
Chriſtians, or elſe they doe
them great wrong. But if
God will accept the ſacrifice
of ſuch (in reuerence
be it ſpoken of his Maieſtie)

hee did Saul vtter wrong,
(which were blaſphemie to
ſay) who did (certainly) many
more good actions, both
towards Gods worſhip and
in his calling, as ye may read
cap. 14. then the moſt of
theſe of whom I ſpeak. And
yet ſeeing it is cleare that he
was reiected of the Lord, I
do conclude, that ſuch kinde
of obedience as I haue here
ſpoken of, (that I repeate it
not againe) is no other then
diſobedience, and that they
which offer it to God, (dying
as they liued, and iuſtifying
their life to bee good) if
they be ſaued, it muſt be by
vertue & authority of ſome
new word of God, for by
the iudgement of the cannonical
ſcripture, they are condemned
already, though for

a very little time it be deferred.
               
                  VERSE 23.
                  
                     For rebellion is as the ſinne of
witch-craft, and ſtubbornneſſe
is as iniquity and idolatry:
becauſe thou haſt reiected
the Word of the
LORD hee hath alſo reiected
thee from being King.
                  
               
               WEe haue heard how
Samuel ſhewed the
weakneſſe,The ſenſe.
yea the badneſſe,
of one part of Sauls anſwer,
namely, in that hee excuſed
his ſin thus, That the people
ſaued the beſt of the Amalekites
cattle aliue, that they
might offer them vnto the
Lord for ſacrifice: and what
inſtruction we ſhould learne
thereby, we haue heard.
               Now followes Samuels
                  
reproofe, to another part of
Sauls anſwer; namely, his
diſobedience and halfe-ſeruice,
that hee had not deſtroyed
all. This, I ſay, Samuel
here reproueth, as if he
ſhould ſay, I haue proued
that thou haſt done againſt
the commandement of the
Lord, which thou wilt not
ſee to bee any offence, but
perſwadeſt thy ſelfe that it
is ſmall, light, and not worth
the ſpeaking of: Heare therfore
what the Lord ſaith vnto
thee, euen that which
thou counteſt little, or no
ſinne: I tell thee from God
(ſaith hee) that it is before
him, and in his account, no
better then witch-craft and
idolatry, which are as odious
to him, as any other; ſo
is thine, euen this thy tranſgreſſion,

and ſo is all witting
and wilfull diſobedience.
And although I nor this
place maintaine, that all ſins
are equall; yet might Samuel
truely tell him, that in his
tranſgreſſion and diſobedience,
God was as iuſtly prouoked
to wrath (ſeeing hee
knew hee caſt his commandement
behinde his backe)
as of them, who commit
witch-craft or idolatry: and
therefore although many at
this day, are as blinde in ſeeing
their ſinne as Saul was,
and as bold to iuſtifie their
bad doings; yet are they in
neuer the better eſtate, for all
that: but in the iudgement
of God and all wiſe Chriſtians,
bewitched and deceiued
by the Deuill moſt palpably,
& therefore miſerable & accurſed.
            
            
               
               Doct.17. Men are far wide in their account of ſin.
               Now to proceede, ſeeing
his ſinne was as witch-craft,
and yet he made light of it,
let vs marke, that this is the
poynt which this Scripture
teacheth; namely, how far
wide men are, in iudging
rightly of and about their
ſinne, and how contrary to
the iudgement of God, and
of the Scriptures, which yet
ſhall iudge euery one in the
latter day: here, I ſay, we may
ſee it: for,
                     
                        〈…〉
                     . that which God
pronounceth to bee odious
and execrable, men count
light and ſmall; God ſheweth
Saul, that his ſinne is as
witchcraft and idolatry:
Saul asketh if it be any at all,
nay he ſaith it is none at all,
but he had fulfilled the commandement
of the Lord: he
ſeeth no cauſe why hee

ſhould be charged with any
treſpaſſe, as long as hee had
done part of that, which was
required of him.
               And how can men bee liker
to him then they bee?
for,Conuictiō of many ſorts, as guilty of this. when their diſobedience
is bewrayed manifeſtly by
the Word of God,Inſtance 1. how many
ſhall yee heare of, which
accuſe themſelues; nay, although
they not onely ſee it
to bee ſo; but that their
ſinne goeth forth openly in
the ſight of men, ſo that all
ſpeake of it; yet is moues
them not, neither troubles
them, but they make a tuſh
at it, and waſh it away boldly
and ſlightly, as if it were
nothing,Prou. 30. as the Harlot wipeth
her mouth, and ſayth,
What euill haue I done?
The reaſon is, that they erre

groſſely,Why men ſlight off ſinne. and are corrupted
in their iudgement, and haue
euill and corrupted conſciences,
and they are ſo, ſeeing
their liues are naught, and ſo
they will haue them, and will
not bee reclaimed; but, to
maintaine their euill doings,
they blind-fold themſelues,
& wil not ſee euen that, which
is moſt groſſe; but call euill
good, and error truth, and ſo
it commeth to paſſe, as it is
to bee ſeene this day, that in
the middeſt of fearefull and
notorious offences, yet it
ſhall ſcarcely bee perceiued
in perſons or townes, that
there are many which ſee it
in themſelues; or lay to heart
the wickedneſſe of others;
by which it mayeaſily be gathered,
that they ſee no great
thing amiſſe. One ſhall eſpy

faults enough in another,Luke 19.
and another in him again,
and many wrongs and
iniuries are cryed out of, and
complained of; but rarely
ſhall yee ſee him, who ſteppeth
forth with Zaccheus,
                  1 Tim. 2. or
Paul, and ſaith, I am the offender,2. & I will make reſtitution:
many ſmart, who are innocents,
and ſuffer without
a cauſe, both taunts, and
mockes, and falſe accuſations,
and reproch, euen for
well-doing, and for true and
ſincere ſeruing of God.
Yea, notwithſtanding godlineſſe
and the Goſpell,
which teacheth it, are both
maintained by a moſt gracions
Prince, ſo that they haue
no Law to iudge them by.
               And what meaſure (think
wee) ſhould the righteous

ſeruants of God, receiue at
the hands of the vnthankfull
and wicked world, if they
had liberty to purſue ſuch,
with ſword & puniſhment,
as they doe with malice in
their ſtomach, and with their
mouthes: ſo, that many baytings
and diſgraces, the innocent
ſeruants of God, ſuſtaine
in the world: but
where are they, that come
forth with Paul, aud confeſſe
againſt themſelues, that
they haue perſecuted the
Church of Chriſt,
                  Acts 9. 4. and haue
ſpoken and intended euill againſt
them without a cauſe?
Of the infinite whoredomes
cryed out of,3. brought to
light; yea, and that in the
open courts, how many do
we ſee come to make ſatisfaction
to the people of God?

or if ſome be brought forth
againſt their wils, yet how
few ſhall bee heard of, who
in token of their true repentance,
accuſe themſelues, and
confeſſe to their own ſhame,
and that as willingly as euer
they committed it, (which
yet they ought to doe) that
they are the great ſinners
that are ſpoken of, that fill
the Countrey with fearefull
reports,Mat. 24. 12 that thus with the
penitent woman in the Goſpell,Luk
                        •
                      7.
they might reuenge
themſelues.
               Thus I might go thorow
the pack of filthineſſe, committed
in the world, and iuſtifie
that which I haue ſayd,
that how bold ſoeuer men
be in committing of them,
and how common ſoeuer
the greateſt faults are with

them; yet, it is rare, to heare
one of many to ſay, What
haue I done? but are ſo far
from any checke and pricke
of conſcience, for them, that
when they are preſſed with
them by preaching (when a
man would thinke they
ſhould not be able to go vnder
the burthen) yet euen
then, they are nothing touched;
but beare downe all
threatnings of God, and reprehenſions
lightly, either
contemning them, or ſcoffing
at them, or at the moſt,
not laying them to heart, and
labouring to thinke of them,
as they heare the Word of
Ged, to cenſure them, wherby
it may eaſily be gathered,
that they ſee little or nothing,
worthy to bee found
fault with, in them, and therfore

cauſe (as much as in
them lyeth) the preaching of
the Word of God, to bee
thought needleſſe (which
God hath commanded ſo
ſtrictly in ſeaſon, and out of
ſeaſon, to bee preached) ſo
that men ſay, it is that which
cauſeth all ſtrife and contention
in townes, and which
bringeth all other calamities
vpon the people.
               The Deuill hath wayes enough,The curſed fruit of this ſin.
both before they
commit it, and afterwards,
when they ſhould repent of
it, to extenuate it, and make
it ſeeme ſmall, till it bee too
late, and till the workers of
it, haue too long lien hardned
in it, and then he aggrauateth,
at their death, or by
ſome ſting of conſcience,
which they cannot quench

and put away, and he fiercely
aſſaulteth them with
ſtrong perſwaſions, that it is
ſo great, that it cannot bee
forgiuen, and ſo is ready to
driue the poore ſinners to
deſperation; yet, hee then
maketh their offence greater,
and more fearefull then the
Scriptures themſelues doe:
for, his property is to come
and appeare to a ſinner firſt,
as a tempter before he commit
it, and after, as an accuſer,
when hee feeles the burthen
of it.
               And all this erroneous
iudging of ſinne,Vnbeleefe, is the cauſe of it. in that they
come ſhort, or goe too farre,
commeth from hence, that
men beleeue not the Word.
For, either they call a foule
and moſt odious fact, an infirmity,
and make it little, as

he in the Goſpell, who ſayd,
when he was a groſſe hypocrite,Luk 18. 3. 
                  Lord, I thanke thee, I am
not as other men, or as this
Publican: or elſe they make
it ſo monſtrous, that there is
no hope of pardon,Mat. 27. 3. as did
Iudas: whereas the Word
teacheth, neither of both,
but to make all ſinne odious,
and to bee affrayd to breake
the leaſt Commandement,
that ſo it may breede mourning,
and true humiliation,
and repentance in vs, that the
more ſowrer and bitter wee
feele our ſinne, the more
ſweet the ſatisfaction of
Chriſt may be vnto vs: But
few labour to beleeue this,
neither are wiſe enough to
ſee into this myſtery;Note. for, if
they did, as the merits and
death of Chriſt ſhould euer

be ſweet and ſauoury, which
now is to the moſt, both
common and comfortleſſe,
ſo ſhould ſin bee euer loathſome
and fearfull. An oath,
alye, deceiuing and ſlander,
ſcoffing, fooliſh ieſting, a
thing not ſeemely, and ſuch
like, if they were accounted
of vs, as witchcraft and idolatry,
wee ſhould little reioyce
in our ſelues, till wee
did walke ſtrongly armed againſt
them.
               Hitherto, theſe two things
haue beene handled in this
verſe: firſt, how odious diſobedience
is, which is commonly
committed among
vs, and that by occaſion of
Samuels words vnto Saul [to
tranſgreſſe, is as witchcraft;
and not to obey, is as the ſin
of Idolatry.] Secondly, how

wide men are, from iudging
rightly of ſinne.
            
            
               Doct. 18. Shifts will not ſerue turne, when God comes to to reckon.
               Now followeth the third.
For, by this anſwer of Samuel
reproouing Saul, and
threatning puniſhment frō
God vnto him; it is cleere
and manifeſt, that though he
had vſed ſhifts, excuſes, and
defences, for his doings, that
they might ſeem good; yet
all would not ſerue: for, if
hee could haue iuſtified his
doings, the Prophet would
not haue proceeded to threaten
the taking away of his
Kingdome. And this teaches,
that no colours, ſhifts,
nor defences, will ſerue vs,
while God by the Miniſtry
of his Word can conuict vs,
and our ſinnes doe make againſt
vs.
               
                  Proofe of the point.For if the Prophet Micah
                  
faith, that God would not
receiue ſacrifices nor offrings
for the peoples iniquitie,
no marueile though ſhifts
and excuſes will not ſerue;
nay, (that which is more) a
man that walketh moſt ciuilly,
and cannot be charged by
men, to be an offenſiue liuer,
but ſhall bee taken for the
moſt innocent of many, yet
if he ſtand vpon that, and ſee
not inwardly into his corruption,
blindenes, vnbeliefe,
he ſhall be ſo farre from being
iuſtified and allowed of
God, that all his righteouſnes
ſhall bee found nothing
but as painting ouer a foule
ſtocke or Image, and his beſt
workes as filthy leprofie:
and for proofe of this which
I ſay, conſider Pauls
words of himſelfe, and of his former

eſtate, when he was not
yet conuerted, thus hee
ſpeakes, as touching my life
from my childehood, and what
it was from the beginning among
my owne nation at Ieruſalem,
                  Acts 26. 4.
                  know all the Iewes,
which knew me heeretofore,
that aftet the moſt ſtraight ſect
of our religion, I liued a Pharaſie;
in which words wee
haue heard what a ſtrickt liuer
and righteous man hee
was: yet that wee may not
thinke that this high commendation
was any thing in
account with God, heare his
words after his conuerſion,
and after the word of God,
was receiued and beleeued
of him, for then he ſpeaketh
after another manner, and
as the truth was: I once was
aliue without the Lawe, but

when the cōmandement came,
ſinne reuiued, but I dyed,Rom. 7. 9. for
ſinne deceiued mee and ſlue
mee. Heere we ſee that hee
himſelfe when hee came to
himſelfe, as a guilty perſon he
condemned himſelfe, notwithſtanding
all the righteouſnes
which he had before,
in his owne; and the iudgement
of other men; ſo that
if ſuch as Paul was (when he
liued moſt ſtrictly in his profeſſion)
who thinke ſimply
they ſerue Godhighly, muſt
yet (if euer they turne to
God) be aſhamed of that
which they gloryed in before;
is it like that they who
are by Gods word conuinced
of great ſinnes, ſhall
eſcape the daunger of his
diſpleaſure, by their colouring
of their faults, and by

ſhiftes and excuſes? Who
had a fayrer ſhewe for his
doing,Luk. 19.
then he that hid his
tallent in the earth, which
was committed to him: for
that is ſure, in ſo doing hee
did no euill with it; but did
that excuſe ſerue him? no:
but becauſe it was giuen him
to doe good with, and to occupie,
therefore it was ſaid
to him, thou euill ſeruant,
why diddeſt thou not put it
to vſe?
               Men beare themſelues in
hand,Vſe.
when the Word of
God reprooueth them, that
they will anſwer it well enough,
and when Preachers
conuince them, they hope
God will not deale with
them ſo hardly, as they doe:
and men loue alwaies to
haue one thing or other, to

flatter and deceiue their
hearts by; like an euill debtor,
who is in danger already,
yet as long as hee can
finde any to borrow of, runneth
further into debt, not
wiſely foreſeeing his ouerthrow
to bee at hand, but
imagines ſtill hee ſhall come
out of it in time. So, when
men can ſhift off the greatneſſe
of their ſinnes, that
they may not terrifie nor
preſſe their conſciences,
they thinke their eſtate good
enough, and ſo dance in a
nette, as if God ſaw them
not; till on the ſodaine before
they be aware, they fall
headlong into feare and deſperation;
or elſe become
ſo ſenceleſſe and hardned,
that they be paſt feeling, till
they die in impenitencie.

And how can it be otherwiſe?
Doth not the ſcripture
tell vs plainely, that he who
followeth not the light walketh
in darknes, and cannot
tell where he goeth. But we
may know that when men
beginne to conceiue of their
eſtate, and their doing, not
being guided by the light of
knowledge, they are out of
the way and deceiue themſelues,
and when they crye
peace,1. Sam. 8 17 Compared with 12. 20 peace, there is no
peace; they finde not that
which they hope for, much
like vnto them who would
haue a King, and be like other
nations, and that they
thought beſt for them (ſay
the Prophet what he could
to the contrary) did they
not finde to their coſts, that
they erred in the imaginacions

of their hearts,Eccleſ. 12. and were
deceiued? The young man
to whom Salomon ſpeaketh,
who will needes rejoyce in
his youth, and take his pleaſure;
if ye tell him that there
is any danger towards him,
will he beleeue it? and doth
he not therefore come to
iudgement, and prooue by
wofull experience, that his
dreames in thinking all is
well with him, are vaine, and
diſapoint his fooliſh hope?
And to ſhut vp this point,
what is clearer then that in
the goſpell, to teſtifie that no
ſhiftes nor excuſes wil'ſerue,
to hold men in their ſinne?
That when certaine were
bidde to the kings great ſupper,
they returned anſwere;
one this way excuſing his
abſence, and another that:

                  one had bought Oxen & muſt
go trie them;
                  Luk. 14. 
                  another had married
a wife, &c. did their excuſes
goe for payment? nay,
could any thing be ſet down
more fearfully to hold men
from fond and forged excuſes
and ſhiftes, to keepe in
their ſinne, then that which
is there mencioned? for thus
anſwere was giuen to them
by him that inuited them,
and that with a vehemen aſſeueration,
that none of them
that were bidden, ſhall taſte of
any ſupper.
               
               
                  Conciuſion of the point▪ with exhortation.By all which it is manifeſt,
that no ſhiftes will ſerue
men, when God ſhall iuſtly
charge them, and when his
word accuſeth and condemneth
their courſe and doings,
there is nothing; and
therefore leaſt of all their

vaine defences in extenuating
their ſinnes or ſhiftes
which they deuiſe, that ſhall
euer be able to ſtand them
in any ſtead, to helpe or deliuer
them. Ceaſe we therefore
from ſuch a purpoſe,
which yet is a common
practiſe amongſt men: and
conſider wee, and be we reſolued,
that God loueth
plaineneſſe, and regardeth
vprightnes, and the good
meaning of the hart, according
to knowledge: and if
our conſciences accuſe vs,
God is greater, and hath
more to charge vs, then they
can bring forth againſt vs:
and thus let Sauls example
teach vs, with the reſt that
haue beene alleadged, how
pregnant ſoeuer men bee in
holding their ſinne, any way

colouring or excuſing of it,
yet that it will not ſerue
them, neither ſhall be to any
purpoſe, and thereby is the
ſcripture verefyed,Prou. 28. 13
hee that
hideth his ſinne ſhall not
proſper.
            
            
               
                  Doct. 19. Our ſinnes depriue vs of our deareſt iewels.
               But another thing is added,
heere by the Prophet,
which followeth vpon the
former, to wit, ſeeing he had
iuſtly reprooued him for caſting
off the Lord, and therfore
had ſhewed him that all
his excuſes were in vaine, for
this cauſe he muſt heare that
which hee would not; that
the Lord had caſt him off from
being King: as if hee ſhould
ſay, whether thy ſinne be ſo
light a matter as thou makeſt
it, iudge thou by the puniſhment
which God threatneth
that is, that thou muſt looſe

thy kingdome for it. And
ſo it came to paſſe afterward;
both another was anoynted
King, and alſo that
none of his poſteritie ſucceeded
him.
               And from hence wee
learne, that howſoeuer wee
pleaſe our ſelues in our ſins,
and will not ſee them, they
ſhall coſt vs deare, and depriue
vs of our beſt commodities
and pleaſures, as they
did Saul of his kingdome.
For what had hee of greater
account then it? and yet this
his ſinne tooke it from him,
and made him goe without
it.
               The like is ſaid in the Lamentations
of Ieremy,
                  
                     Lam. 3 6. 7. Proofes.
that the ſinnes of the people,
haue ſpoyled them of all
their pleaſant things which

were moſt to bee deſired.
And were it not that men
were giuen to ſeek and haue
their will, ſome one way, and
ſome another, (though we
are taught to pray thy will
be done and not ours,) and
to ſerue their owne luſts rebelliouſly,
they ſhould and
might enioy all good things
which they pray for, or better
in their roome: but therefore
they obtaine not when they
aske,
                  Iam. 4. 4 ſaith St. Iames, becauſe
they aske amiſſe, euen that they
may beſtowe them on their
laſts. But otherwiſe as Moſes
ſaith in Exodus, If yee will
heare my voyce indeed,
                  Exod. 19. 5. 
                  and
keepe my couenant, then ſhall
yee be my chiefe treaſure aboue
all people, though all the earth
be mine: If we be his chiefe
treaſure, thinke wee that hee

will not delight in vs, nor
care for vs? if he doe, can
we want any thing that is
good for vs? as it is in the
Pſalme,Pſal. 23. 1.
                  The Lord being my
ſheapheard, I ſhall want no
good thing: yea verily, nothing
ſhould be thought too
good for vs, but bleſſed ſhould
we be in the houſe, and bleſſed
in the field, and bleſſed in all
that we ſet our hand vnto:
                  Deut. 28. 6
of particulars, read furthe
                     •
                   in
Deuteronomy. And therefore
hee ſaith in another
place; Oh, that there were
ſuch an hart in them,
                  C
                        •
                     p. 5. 29. 
                  that they did feare me, and keepe all my
commandements alwayes, that
it might goe well with them!
theſe promiſes,1 Tim. 4 8. though they
ſhall fully and perfectly bee
performed heereafter; yet
are they alſo found verefied

in the children of God, in
this preſent life: as ſaint Paul
writeth to Timothie, ſaying;
godlines hath the promiſes
of this life, and of the life to
come: & whatſoeuer might
be ſpoken to the like purpoſe,
(as the ſcriptures are
moſt copious in this point)
all theſe benefites doe our
ſinnes hold from vs (that I
ſay nothing of the horrible
and fearefull puniſhments
they bring vpon vs) and
ſtrippe vs out of them, as
out of our garments:Note. ſo that
if a theefe bee odious that
ſpoyleth vs of our goods,
how odious (in another
kinde) ought our ſinnes to
be vnto vs? which (as haile
in harueſt beates downe the
corne) ſo doe our euill qualities
and filthy corruptions,

make hauocke of all our beſt
and precious things, as
health, peace, friendes, credit,
yea, euen that which
paſſeth vnderſtanding, as wel
as our goods, euen as it was
no other thing then ſinne,
which firſt ſpoyled our firſt
parents Adam and Eue, of all
good things which God had
giuen them to enioy in the
time of their innocency.
And as diſobedience tooke
from Saul his kingdome, ſo
from the rich men in Luke,
                  Luk. 12. 20. & 16. 25.
that tooke their pleaſure and
goods:1. Cor. 11 30 from the Corinthians,
health and life: from
the Miniſters in Malachie
their honour and places:Mal. 2. 9.
from the women in Eſay,
                  Eſay. 3. 25.
their beauty, which they ſo
much pleaſured in, and turned
it into baldnes; and ſo

doth the like ſinne at this
day, take from all workes of
iniquitie, ſound ioy and
gladnes: we ſee this ſufficiently
verefied dayly among
vs; for what meane theſe
many complaints among vs,
that men enioy not good
dayes, as they deſire and
looke for, but are croſſed and
wearie of their liues, they
haue ſo ill ſucceſſe, & though
they are blinde and ſee not
the cauſe of this, yet indeed
it is nothing elſe but their
ſinne? euen ſundry particulars,
as in another verſe of
Lamentacions, we may read
that Ieruſalem had grieuouſly
ſinned, therefore ſhe was
in reproach, who yet had
beene honoured, and then
remembred all her pleaſant
things, as her ſabathes and

other liberties, and plentie
which ſhee had enioyed:
and although this bee not
fulfilled in all euery day, yet
doe vnbeleeuers hold their
good things in danger and
feare, till the time come that
God will plucke them out
of their hands, which iudgement
is hanging ouer their
heads alwayes, as a ſword
ouer a mans head by a twine
thread, with the point
downeward.
               And therefore they are
wiſe,Vſe.
who beware of offending
of God, for ſo do they
prouide in euery ſtate of life
to liue well and happily: as
it is ſaid by our Sauiour bleſſed
are the meek, for they ſhall
inherit the earth, &c. But if
the wicked flouriſh to day
as the greene bay tree, yet

full ſoone ſhall it come to
paſſe, that no ſigne thereof
ſhall remaine.
               The vſe of this, is to teach vs
to acknowledge, that in euery
particular, as when wee
be depriued of inward comfort,
outward peace, health
wealth, or any other thing,
appertaining either to the
ſoule or body, to checke our
hearts if they haue led vs
too farre any way, and to
waine our ſelues from any
alluring baytes, which haue
faſtned too much vpon vs,
and finally to raine them
in, when they haue in
falſhood or folly, wandred
and departed from dutie:
And thus I conclude that
wee haue great cauſe to beware
of all vndutifull walking
with God, and prouoking

him, as in many
other reſpects, which in
this text are not mencioned;
ſo eſpecially if wee
haue any care of our welfare
heere in this life, that I
ſay no more, becauſe that vnrulines
and wilfulnes, doe
depriue vs of our beſt good
things, eating away the
beautie of them, as a moth
disfigureth the moſt ſeemely
garments.

                     And Saul ſayd vnto Samuel,
I haue ſinned: for I haue
tranſgreſſed the commandement
of the LORD, and
thy words; becauſe I fedred
the people, and obeyed
their voyce.
                  
               
               BVr now it is time to
returne to Saul,
hauing heard how Samuel hath laboured
to bring him to repentance.
It is ſayd here,
that Saul, as bold denials as
he made of his ſinne, and for
all his iuſtefying of his doings,
that he had obeyed the
will of God, in this warre againſt
Amaleck, yet contrary
to all likelyhood, hee now
bewrayeth, to his owne

great ſhame, that hee had
lyed in ſo ſpeaking, and ſo
had not vttered the truth;
for ſo it is ſayd here of him,
I haue ſinned, in that I did not
obey the commandement of
the Lord.
               
               But while Samuel doth
thus narrowly and neerely
follow hard vpon him, mee
thinkes I heare ſome Fauourites
and Pittyers of Saul,
thus ſcornfully braying out.
Oh ſeuere Samuel! and oh
wofull times, and vnhappy
ſtate to liue in, when great
men muſt be purſued of ſuch
baſe fellowes, when Miniſters
and Prophets muſt bee
ſo bold with their betters:
yet welfare the good high
Preiſt Azariah, who (ſay
they) with held ſuch open
mouthed and vnciuill perſons,

from the Kings Court.
And againe, is it meet that a
mean Miniſter ſhould preſſe,
and bee ſo bold with great
perſonages? I haue heard
little leſſe with mine owne
eares, of prophane and irreligious
Gentle-men (as they
are called) but to anſwer
them, they ſee it was meet
then, and the commandement
of the higheſt King,
that the Prophets of God
(who were reuerend men of
God, and by Sauls owne
confeſſion, Gods Choſen,
and not baſe and of meane
account) ſhould do his meſſage
vnto them, that are great
in place and authority, both
publiquely and priuatly, and
as they gaue cauſe, and according
to the manner and
quality of their offence,

ſhould reproue them in the
name of God, and yet gaue
them their due honour, as
became them, for their owne
parts, being their inferiours;
yea, and when they thus did
their meſſage, they were receiued
of ſuch, as were wiſe
and religious, as became the
Amhaſſadours of the high
God: yea, and ſo did Saul
himſelfe honor and receiue
Samuel. I ſay thus it was
then, and thought meet it
ſhould be ſo: but ſo are men
degenerate now from that
practice, that meaner perſons
then Nobles would,
with reproch and contempt,
thruſt ſuch an one as Samuel
from them, and ſcorne any
reproofe that hee ſhould
bring to them, how iuſt ſoeuer,
and in beſt manner it

ſhould bee done vnto them.
And yet I ſpeake not, as
though I thought that all of
that eſtate and degree were
ſuch; but know and am
perſwaded that there are
ſundry of them; yea, and of
the Noble themſelues, who
receiue the Miniſters of God
as his Meſſengers, to whom
(as vnto meaner perſons) I
wiſh no worſe then this, that
both they may enioy ſuch,
plentifully among them, and
receiue them with that reuerence
and credit giuen vnto
them, that they may both
make the ſcorning Atheiſt,
and prophane ſort, more odions
and ſhamefull, who
cannot abide their ſtinking
dung-hill to bee ſtirred, and
may themſelues reape the
bleſſed fruit of their Miniſtry,

I meane that that receiuing
a Prophet in the name
of a Prophet,Matth.10. they may haue
a Prophets reward.
               Now followeth (after Samuels
long trauerſing the
matter with Saul) his confeſſion
of his ſinne: and ſithence
he is brought after ſo
many ſhamefull and fearfull
denials, of that which Samuel
had charged him with, at
length, to confeſſe; and for
that here are other things of
weight, to be conſidered of,
I will ſtay a while, and refer
that, which I haue to ſay about
this matter of Sauls
confeſſion, to theſe foure
poynts. Firſt, I will ſhew
the odiouſneſſe of this ſin, in
that he had ſo oft and boldly
denyed his being in fault,
yet did now confeſſe it. Secondly,

I will declare how,
aud by what meanes, he was
brought to confeſſe it.
Thirdly, ſeeing hee did ſo
(which hee was very vnlike
to come to) whether in confeſſing
hee repented alſo.
And fourthly, becauſe it
ſhall appeare, that hee did
not, therefore euen his very
confeſſion ſhall bee ſeene to
be another note of hypocriſie
in him.
            
            
               Doct. 21. An hypocrite makes no conſcience of lying.
               Concerning the firſt;
of the foulneſſe of his ſin;
in that hee had ſo oft iuſtified
himſelfe (as much as in him
lay) about the accuſations
which the Prophet brought
againſt him, who doth not
ſee how odious it was in
him? And who would not
haue beene perſwaded, that
he ſpake the truth, being ſo

great a perſon as he was, and
ſo boldly and reſolutely affirming
it, when he ſayd, hee
had fulfilled the commandement
of the Lord, when yet
Samuel charged him from
God, that he had broken it?
And whom (almoſt) may a
man beleeue, if hee might
not bee reſted in, and giuen
credit vnto? This is therefore
to teach vs, that it is a
moſt ſhameful and greeuous
offence, when men hyd their
ſinne, and deny that they
are guilty, when yet they
ſhall after confeſſe it freely,
and bee contrary to themſelues,
and ſo lay out their
ſhame to them that liue with
them, when they ſhall affirm
boldly, that they are innocent;
yea, with oath and
proteſtation, that it is ſo, inaſmuch

as hee that heareth
them ſhall ſay; Doubtleſſe,
they ſpeake the truth. And
yet afterward, they themſelues
ſhall deny that, which
they ſo vehemently affirmed.
Oh how fearefull a
thing it is?
               
                  Examples and inſtances. A notable example wee
haue of this,
in the old Prophet
of Bethel: who, when
hee had for his owne vaine
credit, drawne the man of
God, who came from luda
(contrary to the expreſſe
commandement of God) to
eat in that place;1 King. 13.
yet, to his
owne great ſhame, hee was
forced to confeſſe, that hee
had made a lye, in ſaying;
that an Angell appeared to
him, and bad him doe ſo.
               It is the common practice
of men,2.
to ſay and vnſay, to

affirme and deny the ſame
thing, though it hath beene
affirmed with oath and proteſtation.
So that a man
ſhall haue peaceable and
faire words of his neighbor,
and yet falſhood in his dealings:2 Sam. 3. 27 as Ioab ſaluted Abner
friendly, and yet ſmote him
ſo, that he died.
               This ſinne is ſo bred in nature,
and confirmed by cuſtome,
that Gods deare ſeruants
are not free; but are
ſometime ouercome of it, as
we ſee in Peter; who, as well
as hee loued his Maſter, and
profeſſed himſelfe to be his
Diſciple; yet, by a ſmall occaſion,
was brought to deny
that hee knew him, by oath
and proteſtatiou. And if it
bee thus with men, in ſinnes
committed in the ſight of

men, as this of Saul was, how
much more doe men deale
with God in their ſecret ſins?
to hide, excuſe, and extenuate
them, as if they were
none, & asif none were wholer
and ſounder then they,
when yet afterward, when
the Lord ſeeth good to vnskirt
them, they be forced to
cry out as the Prophet did;
but in a far better caſe, when
hee had ſeene the Lord of
glory:Eſay 6.
                  Woe is mee, I am vndone.
               
               Such was the caſe of Ionas,
when the Lord gaue
him his charge, to goe and
to crie againſt Nineueh, hee
fled from his preſence, and
went another way to Tarſhiſh.
And leaſt hee ſhould
haue beene brought backe
againe (ſo little was he troubled

for his ſinne) hee made
all poſſible haſt to bee gone,
and paid for his carriage before
hand, and went downe
into the ſhip, & ſlept ſoundly:
ſo that the fierce wind &
ſore tempeſt, that made the
Mariners afraid, could not awake
him. Then the ſhip maſter
rouſed him vp, ſo that he
ſaw the great danger that he,
with the reſt, was in; for all
that, hee bewayled not, neither
cried out of his ſinne:
and vntill he was ſingled out
by lot, wee read no word of
any remorſe that he had for
it; but for all his concealing
of it ſo long, then hee was
loden with the burthen of it
and repented. But oh how
long firſt? and how gladly
would he haue ſhifted it off?
And thus we would doe all,

through our corrupt nature,
when wee haue offended againſt
his Maieſty, euen flie
from his preſence if wee
could, as Adam did, and
ſhake off all thought, and
goe from all deſire of confeſſing
it to God. But that
ſhall bee with the greater
ſhame to vs, when God ſhall
plucke vs out of our dens
and corners, wherein we had
hid our ſelues.
               And thus Dauid, who had
not accuſed himſelfe for his
foule and groſſe adultery
and murther, till Nathan the
Prophet, from God, had
challenged him for it; yet
after that, cryed out of his
imborne corruption, and affirmed
that to bee the cauſe
of the other, ſaying, I was
borne in ſinne, and by that,

was carried to ſinne againſt
thee in ſecret, and ſo tell to
ſhamefull and open ſinne in
the fight of men.
               The vſe of this doctrin is,Vſe.
that we ſhould bee wary againſt
willing offendings,
and if yet through frailty we
be ouertaken any way, to eſpy
it ſpeedily and expell it,
and in no ſort to ſet a bold
face vpon it, as though nothing
were amiſſe, which if
wee doe, may bee the beginning
of wee know not what
trouble. But ſeeing the further
vſes of this, are ſet
downe in the next poynt, I
referre the Reader thither.
And this be ſayd of the firſt
of the foure things, about
Sauls confeſſion, and what
a ſhame it was to him to bee
brought to it, after many

bold denyals of his fault.
            
            
               Doct. 22. Few ſuch men to bee found, as may be beleeued vpon on their word.
               Now followeth the ſecond,
to wit, how hee was
brought to it, & that was by
the Lord himſelfe; It was
hee that wrung this confeſſion
from Saul, and to make
him ſee his ſinne, whereby,
this he brought to paſſe, that
hee made Saul eat his owne
word, by confeſſing his
fault; yea, euen that which
hee had ſo ſtiffely defended
to bee no fault at all, as wee
haue heard. But is it credible
will ſome ſay, that when
he had boldly, and openly,
and oſt times denyed, that
hee had diſpleaſed God, in
that with which he was charged,
that hee could bee
brought to confeſſe the contrary?
might it be thought,
that hee could beare ſuch

ſhame and reproch, being ſo
great a perſon, when a mean
and inferiour body would
hardly haue gone vnder it?
what ſhall we then ſay if hee
came to confeſſe it, (as it is
cleare he did) but this, whom
may a man beleeue, when
he ſpeaketh good words? as
Saul did heere: whom, if
thouſands had heard him,
they would haue thought he
had anſwered a moſt ſound
truth vnto the Prophe
                     •
                  .
               Indeed I muſt needs ſay,Eſ
                        •••
                     i
                        •
                     lly 
                        〈…〉
                      of

                      cred
                        ••
                     , &c.
that this and ſuch like examples
doe teach, that there is
much falſhood and deceit,
in mans heart, and that further
then wee haue proofe
and experience of mens
truth and ſincerity, in good
conſcience keeping: wee
ought not to bee too credulous,

nor too ready to beleeue
them in their owne
caſe, when they pretend to
tell a truth, and goe about to
cleare themſelues from accuſation.
And moſt of all, if
it bee in a matter concerning
their profit or pleaſure, aſwell
as their credit. For,
men will lye moſt groſſely,
to enrich themſelues, and to
ſeeke their pleaſure and eſtimation;
and therfore, when
theſe bee in ieopardy, and
cannot be vpholden, but by
a lye, he is a rare man, which
in ſuch a caſe will not ſtraine
his conſcience; yea, and go
directly againſt it, both ſecretly
in doing, and openly
in defending euill. Such a
ſway ſinne beareth in a man,
and ſo deare it is to him, that
nothing can ſeperate them

two, but death; they are
ſworne friends, and euen as
two twins, which goe together,
and grow together, ſo
that hurt one, and hurt both;
greene one, and greeue both;
ſo that Ruth was not ſo neerly
knit to Naomi, her mother
in law, as theſe, when ſhee
ſayd,Ruth 1. 
                  God doe ſo and ſo to mee,
if any thing but death ſeperate
vs twaine.
               
               Now therfore,2. they being
thus faſt knit and linked together,
they doe as it were,
ſweare each to other (euen
like a band of theeues together)
that they will neuer bewray
one another. And
hereby it doth come to
paſſe, that when men haue
ſinned greeuouſly, and are
brouhgt forth by moſt cleer
and euident witneſſes, to

ſhame and puniſhment; yet
hardly, and with much ado,
will they bee made to confeſſe
it, whereby they cauſe
many to thinke them innocent,
and falſely charged.
And yet to the bewraying
of ſuch, and bringing them
forth to their ſhame, and
that the iuſt and vpright,
who come againſt them,
may bee iuſtified, God doth
oft times himſelfe (when
there is no other way to be
wray them) bring their wickedneſſe
to light, or force
them to confeſſe their guiltineſſe
at length, euen as wee
ſee it came to paſſe here in
Saul, and daily doth and
hath done in ſundry other.
But the Deuill holdeth them
at this point, as long as hee
can, in the hiding or denying

of the ſame, till a ſtronger
then hee, whom they are
not able to reſiſt, conſtraineth
them to ſay, wee haue
ſinned.
               And thus it was with Saul,
                  God is in the conſcience of hypocrites, forcing them to betray themſelues.
the Lord would haue the ſecrets
of his heart diſcloſed,
who had ſo long and ſtiffely
denyed his ſin. And therefore
hee would bring him to
confeſſion of it, though to
no benefit of his owne; yet
for the inſtruction of his
Church, to the worlds end:
It was neither wrung from
him by force (for what man
might conſtraine him) neither
was he brought to it by
flattery (for hee that dea
                     •
                  t
with him to confeſſe, was
Samuel, the Lords faithfull
Prophet) no, neither did the
moſt weighty conuincing

him by the ſame Prophet,
preuaile with him, nor perſwade
him to repentance,
nor ſo much as to knowledge
his ſin, for that he had
done in the verſes going before:
but Saul waſhed off
all, as wee haue heard.
But the Lord drew him into
it by ſtrong hand, whom
he could not reſiſt nor withſtand.
               And though the telling
him of loſing his kingdome
went neere him; and it is
certaine, that he would haue
done very much, to haue
kept and retained it, and hee
was more moued with the
hearing of that word, then
all that concerned the ſauing
of his ſoule. Yet what was
his confeſſion able to doe,
toward the preſeruing of his

kingdome, which hee knew
wel enough. It was the Lord
therefore that drew him to
confeſſe. And it may teach
vs, that God who doth wonderfull
things, hee alſo forceth
lyars, diſſemblers, and
ſuch as none can wring
from them, the leaſt acknowledgement
of ſinne, which
yet is well known, that they
are guilty of it, and do (with
tooth and nayle (as they ſay)
denie it, yet after all this, the
Lord will make, euen themſelues
to bring it to light, &
confeſſe it.
               And this he doth for theſe
endes.Reaſons 1.
Firſt that all may
knowe how bad and vile the
heart of man is, and how
ſtiffe, wilfull and ſubtill it is,
yea, and hardned, which
would not eaſily be beleeued,

except the Lord ſhould
by ſome meanes bewray it,
no other being more auailable
heereto, then the parties
owne confeſſion, which is
more then many witneſſes.
               Secondly,2.
the Lord doth
it to this end, that we ſhould
not hide, denie, or extenuate
our ſinnes when we are conuicted
of them, or when we
ought freely to confeſſe
them, for by ſo doing wee
ſhall encreaſe our ſinne, and
either be forced afterwards
with the more ſhame to confeſſe
it, as Saul heere did, or
be preſſed with the load and
burthen of it (when God
ſhall viſite vs) to hardnes of
hart and deſpaire.
               Thirdly,3
that wee ſhould
not be too light of credit to
beleeue men vpon their bare

word, no, although they be
earneſt therein, for they may
(for all that) euen themſelues
auouch the contrary.
               Laſtly,4.
to this end God
will thus drawe men to confeſſion,
to feare vs from
bold denialls of the truth,
and to teach vs to rule our
hearts, & gouerne our liues
in ſuch good manner, that he
bee not driuen to ſuch vnwelcome
arreſtings of vs.
               To this end I thinke it
not amiſſe,A remarkable inſtance of this doct. to tell you of a
report which a graue Preacher
vttered in the Pulpit,
and it was this. There was a
man who had committed a
fearefull murther. Hee was
conuicted thereof by the
Law, he vtterly denyed it:
he was vrged by his friendes
to confeſſe it, but in no wiſe

would be brought to it: the
Preacher tooke him in hand,
but he would not acknowledge
it, he was brought to
the place of execution, and
there he was much laboured
with to acknowledge it,
but for all this, hee would
yeeld no whit. What of all
this, ye will aske, or to what
end is this example alleadged?
I anſwere to very
great, for when all hope was
paſt, and hee was caſting
downe from the ladder, hee
claſped his hands about the
gallowes, and cryed out ſaying,
it was I that committed
the murther. It is therefore
to bee feared, that at the
death God will force ſuch
men to confeſſe, (to their
woe) that which in their
health and proſperitie they

would neuer be brought to.
We read of Achan,
                  Ioſhua. 7. 21 a man of
the moſt honourable tribe
of Iuda,Other examples. that when Iericho
was taken, and commandement
was giuen, that no
man ſhould take to his priuate
vſe the execrable things
(which were found in the
ſpoile, vpon perrill of death;
yet hee ſeeing therein a goodly
Babiloniſh garment, of great
price, and 200. ſhekles of ſiluer,
and a wedge of gold, coueted
them and tooke them:
And when he ſaw that moſt
ſolemne inquirie was made
(by the Lords commandement)
for him that had committed
the treſpaſſe through
all the tribes and families of
Iudah: ſo that hee ſawe hee
muſt needes be found out,
yet he keepes his ſinne cloſe,

and goes for an honeſt man,
(as he was of good wealth
and reputation among the
people) and was thought
no worſe nor otherwiſe of,
then other his neighbours
were, vntill he was bewrayed,
and detected in the ſcrutiny,
and ſearch which the
Lord commanded to bee
made for the treſpaſſers by
lotte. But to paſſe to another:
when Gehazai the ſeruant
of the Prophet Eliſha,
had ſeene great offers made
to his maſter, of ſiluer and
gold by Naaman the Syrian,
for healing him of his leproſie,
and that his maſter had
refuſed them, we read that
he went after the noble man,
when he was departed from
the Prophet, and by a lying
ſpeach, got of him two tallents

of ſiluer, and two
change of garments, and
when he came as at other
times, to ſtand before his
maſter, and to miniſter to
him, and he had ſaid to him,
whence commeſt thou Gebazai?
                  2 King. 5. 25 did hee confeſſe it?
nay: but with a bold lie couered
the fact, ſlightly anſwering,
thy ſeruant went no
whether, meaning hee was
but where he ſhould be, that
is about his buſines: Who
would haue ſaid, that ſuch
an one, being ſeruant of ſo
holy a man of God, would
haue wrought ſuch villanie,
and haue cloaked it ſo craftily
as he had done, and ſtill
would haue done, if the
Lord had not bewrayed him
to his maſter? So ſweete is
mans ſinne, and ſo couertly

it will winde in with them
that euen the wiſe may bee
deceiued in iudging of them,
and would not thinke ſo
hardly of them, as they giue
occaſion: Which our Sauiour
knowing,Ioh. 2. namely, what
depth of ſubtiltie and hollownes
was in mens hearts,
did not commit himſelfe to
many, though ſuch as ſeeing
his miracles, did make ſhew
that they beleeued in him;
and becauſe God hath made
vs acquainted with ſuch a
truth, that there is much
falſhood and deceite in the
heart, euen 7. abhominacions
as Salomon ſaith.
               The vſe heerof is,Vſe. 1.
that wee euer haue our hearts in
iealouſie, ſuſpect and feare
them, yea, ſearch them thorowly
and and proue them,

yea, in the things which wee
loue beſt, that wee bee not
found guilty of any treacherie,Note.
and vnfaithfull dealing
before God, but that our innocency
and integritie, may
alwaies be found to abide
with, and accompany vs, and
that whatſoeuer the wicked
world delight to iudge of
vs, yet they may not haue,
no not ſo much as any ſhew
of matter, iuſtly to conuict
vs of: that ſo we may haue
that ſweete and pretious libertie
to reioyce in, which
the Prophet maketh ſo great
reckning of, when hee ſaith,
heereby I know that thou
loueſt me,Pſal. 41. 12.
becauſe mine enemie
doth not triumph ouer
mee, but thou holdeſt
mee in mine integritie.
               Alſo this ſhould teach vs,Vſe.2.
                  
that we ſhould not be ouer
haſtie, to iudge and determine
of mens eſtates, no although
wee ſee ſome good
tokens in them, by embracing
the tydings of the goſpell,
more readily & cheerefully
then the common ſort
doe, till we haue experience
and proofe of their ſyncerity
and faithfulnes: for euery
faire countenance to it, and
to the profeſſors of it, in the
time of peace, is no ſufficient
teſtimony for vs to iudge
of their vprightnes; yet neither
is it my meaning to
condemne or iudge hardly
of them, whoſe hearts we
know not, neither can gage:
but as charitie is not ſuſpicious
but hopeth well, euen ſo
to iudge and ſpeake of them:
much leſſe is it meete for vs

to perſwade our ſelues, that
ſuch as haue no care in them,
but a ſhew of godlines, by
worſhipping of God with
vs publiquely, are to bee taken
for faithfull chriſtians,
eſpecially when we ſee, with
our liuing with them, that
they deny the power of
godlines, to rule in their
words and actions:Note.
and yet I ſay not of thoſe that bee
ſuch, that we are to giue any
finall ſentence vpon them,
ſeeing the Lord changeth
when and whome he will.
               And further,Vſe. 3.
let vs marke
that wee ſhould not feare euer
the more, if we walke in
innocency, though wicked
men bee ſecure, bold, and
iuſtifie their badliues, ſometime
ſhameleſly, as though
they would make vs beleeue

that God allowed of their
courſe, and vtterly condemned
ours: for ſo it might
ſeemeſomtime, when wee
ſee them proſper, and our
ſelues vnder the croſſe, euen
as the godly Prophet himſelfe
was troubled with this
temptation, that, hee did in
vaine clenſe his heart and
waſh his hands in innocencie
when he ſaw them merrieſt,Pſal. 73. 3. who liued moſt ſecurely
and worſt.
               But this example of Saul
and ſuch like, doe free vs
from ſuch feare. For they
muſt come to confeſſe, that
all the iollity of theirs was
but froth, and that they
highly diſpleaſed God, in
the middeſt of their ſecurity,
& therefore had more cauſe
to houle: yea, all ſuch glory

of theirs muſt bee to their
ſhame: and they muſt vomit
vp their ſweet morſells:
And as the Pſalmiſt faith,
fret not at the vngodly whoſe
wayes doth proſper,
                  Pſal. 37. 1.
                  for ſodainely
they ſhall come to a
fearefull end: So I ſay: feare
not to ſee them bold in euill,
as though they could make
it good in the end, for aſſuredly
the time muſt come,
when they muſt wiſh that
they had neuer done it, and
confeſſe that therein eſpecially
they ſinned, in which
they moſt gloried: and if it
be ſo, then we may well ſay
with the Apoſtle, what fruite
had yee in thoſe things whereof
yee are now aſhamed?
                  Romans. 6.
It is the part of a wiſe man, to
beginne with ſome hardnes,
that he may afterwards enioy

more eaſe; and our Sauiour
ſo teacheth his, that
they muſt weepe and lament,
                  Iob. 16. 20.
                  but their mourning ſhall bee
turned into ioy: Whereas the
fooliſh world doth contrarily,
for it reioyceth in ſtollen
and vnlawfull liberties,
which cannot hold long:
and when they haue done;
and would faine cloake
them, they muſt goe to howling,
ſorrow and ſhame, for
committing them: And it
commeth the hardlier vpon
them, and is more vnwelcome
to them, becauſe they
accuſtoming themſelues to
pleaſure and eaſe, they looked
for no breaking it of, nor
for any change. And what
other cheere did our forefathers
finde in the booke of
Iudges, in all their caſting of

the Lords gouernment and
ſeruice, but crying? The
which what wiſe men
would haue ſought and procured
it to themſelues, eſpecially
when it muſt bee continuall,
as the moſt is in ſuch
a caſe, becauſe euery one
cannot crie to repent, and
therfore muſt cry in deſpaire
and impenitencie.
               And becauſe I thinke this
thinke this point is ſufficiently
ſeene into,The godly haue ſmall cauſe to long after the wickeds deynties.
I will ſhut
it vp, concluding vpon this
that hath been ſaid, and vp
on like experience, that for
my part it little moues me
to ſee men walke after their
owne deſires, and to be (as
they ſay) at their owne hand,
to be lawleſſe as it were, ſinning
with pride and contempt
of reproofe, and admonition,

and to pleaſe
themſelues in that which is
euill. I ſay, it little moueth
me to thinke them the only
happie people, who liue in a
manner as they luft, and ſet
themſelues a ſtint how farre,
and beyond which they will
not goe in ſeruing God: I lament
the eſtate of all ſuch, as
looke after no ſerious and
true worſhipping of him;
more particularly, the ſloth,
pride, and prophanenes of
many in the miniſtrie: the
little regarding of Gods
matters, and ſetting vp of
his honour, and magnifying
the goſpell as they may: in
many of them who haue rule
ouer other, how little care
they haue to rule themſelues?
(though no time be
too much to look after their

own profit, pleaſure and preferment)
and in all ſorts of
people how prepoſterouſly
they goe to worke, ſetting
earth before heauen, darkeneſſe
before light, louing
their fooliſh delights more
then God, and hauing a ſhew
of godlines, yet denie the power
thereof, and are ſtrangers
from the life of God, I ſee
their ſorrow and woe not
ſarre of; Oh that I could
perſwade them, that which
I knowe; and that mine eies
were a fountaine of teares,
that I could weepe bitterly,
for the deſolation that ſhall
come on them. for let them
ſay as long as they will with
Saul; wee in thus liuing, doe
pleaſe God and obey him,
they ſhall (as little as they
thinke it) confeſſe with Saul,
                  
that euen therein they haue
ſinned; and thereby vndone
themſelues.
               
                  A queſtion whether Saul repented.
                  
                     VERSE. 24. & 25.
                     
                        And Saul ſaid vnto Samuel,
I haue ſinned: for I haue
tranſgreſſed the commandemen
of the LORD, and thy
wordes; becauſe I feared
the people, and obeyed their
voyce.
                     
                     
                        Now therefore, I pray thee,
pardon my ſinne, and turne
againe with me, that I may
worſhip the LORD.
                  
                  TWO of the foure things
haue beene ſpoken of, the third followes.
                  Therefore to paſſe to the
third of the foure points,
touching Sauls confeſſion,

whether hee alſo repented.
As the Diſciples ſaid of Lazarus
to Ieſus, Lord if hee
ſleepe he ſhall doe well: ſo
ſay ſome of Saul, if hee bee
come to confeſſe his ſinne,
he ſhall doe well: conſidering
how farre of hee was
from it, and how hardly he
was brought to it. 
                        Anſwere. 
                     
To whom I anſwere, alas, that action
was violent, and wrung from
him for the loſſe of his kingdome,
as may bee thought:
it was not free and vnfeined
(no more then Iudaſſes confeſſion).

                        〈◊〉
                      nor he conſtant
in it, and therefore it was far
from being a fruite of repentance.
                  But ſeeing the cauſe muſt
firſt be reaſoned of, before it
be concluded▪ I will firſt ſay
on both ſides ſomewhat; I

meane what likelyhood of
repentance was in Saul: and
on the other ſide, what may
be brought forth and ſaid againſt
it, wherupon the truth
will ſoone appeare.
                  That which may moſt
probably be ſaid for it, that
I can ſee or finde, is this.
Firſt, that this confeſſion of
ſinne was not only in generall,
but alſo particular, and
of that very ſin with which
he was charged, and which
he had before denyed. For
if it had beene but generall,
it might haue ſeemed to bee
leſſe regarded. And as hee
did it particularly, ſo it was
that, wherein he had moſt offended.
Secondly, this may
be ſaid for ſome likelihood
of his repentance, that hee
did after this, call Samuell to

goe with him to worſhippe
God, and deſired him to
pray for him.
                  But theſe were very weake
proofes, as ſhall eaſily appeare
by them, that ſhall be
brought on the contrarie,
and by that which ſhall further
bee ſaid of them. For
concerning his confeſſion, it
was no better then Iudaſſes,Mat. 27. 4.
which was alſo of a particular
ſin, and that which moſt
concerned him, as may bee
ſeene by his words, when he
ſaid, I haue ſinned in betraying
the innocent blood: and it
was nothing like Dauids in
ſoundnes, who yet did confeſſe,
but generally, ſaying,
I haue ſinned. Indeed for the
outward manner of Sauls
confeſſion layd forth in
words,2 Sam. 12. 1
                           •
                        
                      there can no ecception

be made againſt it: And
I graunt that there was no
more to be ſeene in the confeſſion
of the people of Iſraell,2 Sam. 12.
whereby they teſtified
their true repentance. But
we muſt know that repentance
is neuer in the ſcripture,
neither ought of vs to
be meaſured by the outward
confeſſion only, but by the
vprightnes of heart; lamenting
after God, who hath
beene ſo ſore prouoked, and
by the vnfained faith of the
partie, and by the renouncing
and forſaking of ſinne.
                  Theſe graces muſt bee
found to accompany confeſſion,Note.
ſo that it may bee
ſound and good, and without
them it is nothing
worth: and Sauls being
voyd of theſe, was in no

wiſe to be taken for a true
note of repentance. And
that theſe muſt go with confeſſion,
is to be ſeene in many
places of ſcripture. For
Dauids confeſſion, that it
came both from faith and
repentance, is cleere by Nathans
words, ſaying to him,
vpon his confeſſion made,
the Lord hath forgiuen thee
thy ſinne: which is neuer
obtained without them.
And ſo Salomon ſaith:Prou. 28. 
                     hee
that confeſſeth and forſaketh
his ſinne (which is done of
none, but of him who beleeueth
it to bee forgiuen
him) hee ſhall finde mercie.
And therefore Sauls confeſſion,
not going with the forſaking
of his ſinne (for hee
waxed worſe after it) neither
comming from faith, which

muſt haue gone before both,
I conclude, that it was voyd
of repentance. And for his
worſhipping of God which
is the other thing alleadged
to proue it, ſeeing hee grew
worſe after it, let all iudge
as they ought, and they ſhall
finde that as weake, to witneſſe
ſo weighty a matter, as
his confeſſion doth, for
what change was in him after
(except from euill to
worſe) or what ſigne all that
preſent time, or afterward
that his heart relented, and
melted for diſpleaſing God?
without the which, all the
reſt was but as the morning
dewe, which is ſoone licked
away with the heate of the
Sunne: Indeede hee ſaid, I
haue ſinned, yea, and to Samuel
pray for me to the Lord,

that hee would forgiue my ſin;
and againe: returne with me
that I may worſhip the Lord:
but what of all this? Did he
not ſhewe himſelfe to be the
ſame he was before?
                  But to ſay any more of
Sauls ſinne, ſeeing it is manifeſt
in the ſtorie following,
and I ſhall haue occaſion in
my text to ſay enough of it,
I will not trouble the reader
with needleſſe repetitions,
but referre him thither.
                  And thus much of the
third point of the foure,
whether Saul in confeſſing
his ſinne, repented alſo.
                  From which diſcourſe,Vſe of this diſcourſe.
yet let this bee learned, that
many Proteſtants in our
dayes, come far behind Saul
in his confeſſion: for hee
made it particularly, and of

that ſinne which was moſt
brought againſt him of all
other, by Samuel: but thoſe,
of whom I ſpeake, make either
no confeſſion, or in generall
onely, as that wee are
all ſinners; or if of particulars,
they ſhall bee ſuch as
concerne them not: as if a
worldly man ſhould pray againſt
pride and drunkenneſſe,
or when they ſay the
Confeſſion in the Church
after the Miniſter, neuer
marking what they ſay: and
the beſt of them doe but as
he did, that is, confeſſe particularly
without repentance.
And thoſe that practiſe
theſe manners of confeſſion,
are many thouſands.
Theſe come behinde Saul in
their confeſſion, as they may
eaſily ſee.
                  
                     
But to goe a little further:
let the beſt looke that they
haue better proofes of their
good eſtate and welfare to
God-ward, then the confeſſing
of their ſinnes, how
particularly ſoeuer they bee
made: for, they are no good
euidences thereof. Yea, and
not onely ſo, but let them as
well beware, that other
ſhewes of godlineſſe (as
weeping for ſinne ſomtime)
doe not deceiue them, or any
other common gifts of
the Spirit, as to be ſometime
well moued at a Sermon, for
none of them can witneſſe
their aſſurance, or be ſound
and cleere proofes to them
of their ſaluation.
                  And therefore let other
weake Chriſtians take heed,
that they bee not offended,

neither take occaſion to depart
from their good beginnings
in their profeſſion,
when they ſhall ſee ſuch,
who are of good hope, to
go away from the good that
ſeemed to bee in them: neither
let them faint and
ſay, oh they ſhall neuer
hold out to the end, ſeeing
ſuch as they, are thought to
be farre before them, are fallen
away and reuolted. Finally,
let vs ſeeke out better
and ſurer proofes of our repentance,
and true turning
to God, then confeſſing of
ſinne onely, and calling on
God, as thoſe: that we may
cleere our conſciences before
God and men, and that
wee depart from iniquity,
and bee not tainted or branded
with any kinde thereof,
willingly.
               
            
            
               
               Doct. 23. The Hypocrite bewrayes himſelfe, euen in his beſt actions.
               I will now proceed to the
fourth and laſt poynt: hee
did not ſhew himſelfe to bee
the ſame he was before, I ſay
therefore that Saul, euen in
his confeſſion, ſhewed himſelfe
an Hypocrite, and that
by his own words, who was
ſo accuſtomed to accuſe ſin,
by hollow and ſlight dealing,
that euen now, when
he was at the beſt, and came
moſt neere to repentance of
all other times; yet euen
now (I ſay) he could not be
free from it.
               For, leſt hee ſhould haue
layd too great fault on himſelfe,
in confeſſing his ſinne,
therefore ſaying, I haue ſinned:
therefore hee ſayd,The 12. note. I
was afrayd, if I had not yeelded
to them, contrary to
Gods Commandement, to

ſaue aliue the beſt of the cattle,
that they would haue rebelled
and haue riſen vp a
gainſt me. Lo, this was the
bladder without winde, and
cloud without water, which
appeared in Saul, when hee
was at the beſt, I meane,
brought to confeſſe his ſin,
which was nothing but a lie,
and a coloured excuſe. For,
the Lord by the Prophet, in
the 19 verſe, conuinced him
of a couetous minde and
diſobedient, that he himſelfe
turned to the prey. So, that
as hee was hardly brought
thus farre, as to confeſſe his
ſinne, ſo yet when hee did
it, it was for feare of loſing
his Kingdome: yet, euen
this (which ſeemed good in
him) was corrupt and
naught: for beſides that, he

bewrayed ſo much himſelfe,
as I haue ſayd, by excuſing
his fact, ſo doth the Spirit of
God by Samuel, bewray the
ſame in the next verſe, where
he plainely ſheweth, that he
did not accept, nor allow of
it. What ſhall we ſay then, if
it be thus?Hard for an hypocrite to leaue his trade. Truly this: that
it is an hard thing for an hypocrite,
to leaue and forgoe
his trade of diſſembling, euen
as it was for Demetrius,
                  Acts 19.
to forgoe his wicked gaine;
and for the Blackmore to
change his skin, by waſhing;
which, though it bee true of
all ſinnes leaning to manward;
yet ſomewhat more
it may be ſayd of the hypocrite,
then of other ſinners:
For an open offender (as
Paul and the Iaylour were)
when hee is pricked in conſcience,

and troubled in
minde, ſhall much eaſilier
bee perſwaded, that it is in
truth, and ſhall bee forgiuen
then the hypocrite ſhall: not
that I ſtint or reſtraine the
worke of the Spirit, that it
cannot bee as effectuall in
one, as in another: but God
ſo diſpoſeth ordinarily, that
the hypocrite hauing ſinned
more groſſely and greeuouſly,
ſhall be harderly able to
apply, and be perſwaded of
Gods promiſes, then other
ſinners; though they bee in
a like manner deliuered to
them both. Ordinarily, I
ſay (though God may, when
it pleaſeth him, doe otherwiſe)
but hee ſhall long (for
the moſt part) bee vnder the
doctrine, before hee ſhall reſolue
of his vprightneſſe.
               
                  
Whereby it may be ſeen,A long time ere any great good be done by preaching.
that wee, by our preaching
and priuate conferring, may
a long time trauell and labor
with wicked perſons, before
wee can bring them to ſee,
and turne from their wicked
liues, for the moſt will not
bee brought to it (but hope
they ſerue God, as well as others
do) and when we haue
preuailed ſo far with them,
as to make them ſee and
confeſſe, as Saul heere did
ſomewhat; yet at times, we
haue them in neuer the better
caſe, for all that: but they
deceiue vs ſtill: yea, themſelues
rather, & fruſtrate our
hope, that we ſhall ſeeme to
haue don no good, inwearying
our ſelues about them:
ſo that the propheſie is fulfilled:Ier. 6. 29.
                  The bellows are burnt,

the lead is conſumed in the fire,
the Founder melteth in vaine,
for the wicked are not taken away:
as if hee ſhould ſay,
that all the labour that is taken
with them, is loſt: and is
it not come to this ſame, or
like point at this day? for, to
ſay nothing of ſundry, yea,
too many Miniſters, who
are far from burning the bellowes
with any great painetaking
(who yet muſt know,Luke 19.
that they were hired by the
Maſter of the worke to labour,
aud not to loyter, and
to vſe their talent, and not to
bury it in a napkin) how many
diligent and faithful Paſtors,Mat. 11. 17
may make this complaint of
the people: Wee haue piped
vnto yo
                        •
                     , and yee haue not
danced: wee haue mour
                        •
                     ed
to you, and yee haue not wept.

All the day long hath the Lord
ſtretched out his hand,
                  Eſay 65. 2. 
                  but to a
diſobedient and gaine-ſaying
people: for, though they will
heare vs, yet they doe but as
the people did to Ezechiel in
his time:Ezek. 33. 32 
                  they ſate and heard
his words, but they did not
after them.
               I ſpeake not this, as if I
did heereby goe about, to
perſwade that all doe ſo, and
that there is no fruite of our
miniſtrie and labours, where
they are faithfully and reuerendly
beſtowed, for then I
ſhould be too vnthankefull,
who confeſſe that I know
euen in our parts, where I
am beſt acquainted, that
God hath bleſſed the labours
of ſundry, who haue
ſought and deſired it: and
in many places men haue

been turned from their euill
wayes, and to ſuch as ſate
in darkenes, and in the ſhadow
of death, light is riſen
vp: And it is credible, that
if the miniſters generally
and throughout, ſought the
things that are Chriſts, more
then their owne, and counted
it their ioy, & that wherin
they might glory at the
comming of the Lord, to
winne many: I ſay it is very
credible, and little to be feared
that an 100. fold more
fruitfull harueſt, might bee
reaped by their paines and
trauell, them now may, or is
to be looked for: But yet to
ſpeake of the multitude and
greateſt number, euen where
there is faithfull labouring,
yet there is ſmall profiting:
for, though many come to

confeſſing of their ſinne (as
they did in the time of Iohn
Baptiſt, many then came
from Iudea, and the Region
round about Iordan, and
were baptized of him, confeſſing
their ſinnes: yet ſundry
of them being Phariſies
and Scribes repented not.)
Euen yet here are too many
of them, who do not ſo lay
their ſinnes to heart, as that
they turne from them indeed;
comming to the oath
and the couenant, as the people
did in Nehemiahs time,
that ſo they may bring forth
fruit, worthy amendment of
life: wheras we would think,
that when they are brought
ſo far, the worſt were now
paſt, and there were no more
danger, or feare of condemnation.
               
                  
And what hindreth or is the
cauſe why it is not ſo?The cauſe heereof. Euen
their falſe heart, and the deceitfulnes
of ſinne; which
hath blindfolded and hardned
them: that wee may
learne, what a bondage it is
to ſerue ſinne, and for men
to giue ouer themſelues to
the allurements thereof:
Whereas if we haue not obtained
this at Gods hands,
I meane to ſhake off that
which we knowe will be our
ouerthrowe; what haue we
to reioycein? I denie not,
but that the experiencedſt
Chriſtians, haue enough to
doe, to hold vnder their rebellious
hearts, and ſin cauſeth
them oft to cry out, ob
wretched men that wee are!
but yet for all that, they giue
not place to the luſts therof,

but riſe againe if they bee
fallen, and cannot be well in
themſelues, till they returne
vnder Gods gouernment,
where alone they count it
good, being to remaine.
               But when men come to
know,Cantic. 5. 3. 
                  there is no peace to the
vngodly, and namely, whilſt
they lye in any knowne ſin,
and when they haue confeſſed
and profeſſed againſt it;
yet become ſlaues to it againe,
this is in no wiſe tolerable:
ſuch by cuſtome, and
long lying therein, prouide,
that when they would ſhew
themſelues beſt of all; yet
they cannot then deale
plainely, but they ſhall bewray
themſelues, to ſuch as
can iudge, that they doe but
halt, and deale hollowly, as
Saul here did. For, what

doth more bewray them,
then their own words, when
they ſhall bee ready to alledge,
being vrged to vprightneſſe
and care; they
hope there is reaſon in all
things, an they cannot bee
Saints, they ſay, in this life,
and they are ſure all are ſinners,
with ſuch like.
               And as this may be obſerued
to bee an vſuall thing,A returne to the doctrine: & fuller cleering of it.
with men of little conſcience,
throughout their
whole courſe, that though
they acknowledge themſelues
to bee ſinners, euen in
thoſe things, which ſometime
they would defend, and
maintaine to bee no faults;
yet they forſake them not,
neither abandon them vtterly:
ſo yee may ſee it to
bee with them, euen in time

of affliction,Note well. to wit, that they
bee but hollow, as wee
muſt thinke it now to haue
beene with Saul, when in
Gods diſpleaſure, hee ſent
the Prophet to tell him, that
hee ſhould loſe the beſt
thing hee had, euen his kingdome.
               And yet who would not
thinke, that at ſuch times,
men would bee ready to
yeeld to any condition, ſo
that they might bee deliuered
from ſuch troubles, as
oppreſſe them? And much,
I grant, they will yeeld and
promiſe,Examples. then for feare: but
(as yee haue heard of him)
not heartily, nor in truth.
God had ſo acquainted Pharaoh,
with his puniſhing of his
treachery and diſobedience,
that hee brought him oft to

confeſſe his fault, and to couenant
the contrary: but euer,
when hee ſhould performe
and keepe his couenant,
hee went from it, and
dealt falſly: whereupon, all
ſuch hollow and dodble
dealing, was called Pharaohs
ſinne.
               A moſt liuely patterne of
this,Pſal. 38. 34 
                  Dauid ſetteth downe, of
the people of Iſrael, out of
former hiſtories, ſaying:
When he ſlue & plagued them,
then they ſought him, and they
returned, and ſought God early,
and they remembred that
God was their ſtrength, and
the moſt high God, their Redeemer:
but they flattered him
with their mouth, and diſſembled
with him, with their
tongue: for their heart was
not vpright with him, neither

were they faithfull in his couenant:
whereby may bee gathered
moſt cleerely, that
though they ſought to God,
for feare of puniſhment; yet
ſuch was their falſhood, that
in their hearts they loued
him not: and therefore,
could not meane well and
truely, not hauing due conſideration,
in their good
ſpeeches, what they ſaid:
And yet this is the beſt dealing,
that ſuch deceiuers and
diſſemblers can afford him:
for, as Traytours ſet on the
racke, doe vtter much, who
yet loue not the Magiſtrate,
who racks them: ſo ſinners
confeſſe much vnder the
croſſe; but by conſtraint
and violence, not willingly
and humbly to iuſtiſie God
in his puniſhing of them, nor

for that they are perſwaded
hee loueth them, and therefore
they can ſhew none to
him againe. And therefore,
if men can doe no more, but
ſo, ideſt, confeſſe in theit afflictions,
ſome faults to
God, as the boy vnder the
rod: if neither before their
afflictions, they gaue true teſtimonies
of their repentance,
nor after, bring forth
fruits of amendment. They
are in no better account with
God, then they, who neuer
made any profeſſion, or proteſtation
of amendment, at
all.
               
                  
                     Queſt. 
                   If yee aske, why God ſuffered
them to come thus far,
as to accuſe and finde fault
with themſelues, if they bee
neuer the better, nor neerer
ſaluation?
               
                  
                  
                     Anſw. 
                   I anſwer, there are many
cauſes,Reaſons why God vrgeth the bad to confeſſion, although bootleſſe. why God doth bring
them thus far, as to confeſſe
againſt themſelues, though
they bee neuer the better for
it. One is in reſpect of his
faithfull people,1. that while
he holdeth the wicked vnder
the croſſe,Note. the faithfull may
haue more freedome and liberty
to ſerue him; as the
people of Iſrael had, while
Pharaoh was plagued. For,
as many breaches in the ſea
bankes, may bee repaired
while the ſea goeth away:
and much corne in the inconſtant
weather, may bee
reaped by the husbandman,
while the day is faire and
cleere: ſo the godly may
edifie, and build vp themſelues
in faith, feare and the
knowledge of God, while

he putteth his hooke in the
noſtrils of the wicked, and
bridles them from rage, by
ſuch a forcing of them to
confeſſe it to bee good and
holy to liue ſo: and themſelues
to be held vnder, with
feare of Gods iudgements, is
a righteous thing in the ſight
of God, and the godly are
more incouraged thereto,
when they heare the way of
godlineſſe to bee commended
by them, who were
wont to ſpeake euill of it,
& to perſecute thoſe, which
were the zealouſeſt embracers
of it: As, who doth
not know what an emboldening
it was, to the poore
Diſciples at Damaſcus, and
round about it, when they
heard that Saul their Archenemy,
who brought letters

from the high Preiſts to impriſon
them, was conſtrained
by the mighty power of
God, to renounce and cry
out of his doing, and to confeſſe
his cruelty againſt the
Saints, and to iuſtifie them;
yea, when it was not known
to them, that he had repented;
neither durſt they, as
yet, truſt to him, that he was
truely conuerted.
               And this is one cauſe, why
God doth ſuffer the bad,
ſometime to confeſſe their
ſins, and accuſe themſelues,
although they ſhould not
come to true repentance,
and this is done, as all may
ſee, for the Faithfuls ſake.
               Another cauſe is, in reſpect
of the wicked themſelues,
and that is this, that while
they are forced to iuſtifie

and allow of the ſincere
courſe of the ſeruants of
God, and to cry out of their
owne, they condemne their
former wayes, when they
lay in ſin, and purſued thoſe
that were better then themſelues,
and they doe thereby
giue ſentence againſt themſelues,
if euer they doe the
like againe. And thus much
of the painted ſhew of repentance
in hypocrites, by
occaſion of Sauls confeſſion.
And this be ſaid of Sauls
hypocriſie, the laſt of the
ſoure things concerning his
confeſſion.
               Now to goe forward, ſeeing
Saul ſaid alſo beſides in
this verſe, that hee had done
againſt the words that Samuel
ſpake to him, and ſaid
moreouer, that he feared the

people; therefore of both
theſe a little. For the firſt:
the words that Samuel ſpake
to Saul, were the reprouing
of his ſinne, and the conuincing
him of it, and the aggrauating
thereof, as God
had commanded him to do.
All which words wee haue
heard, how boldly Saul waſhed
them off, and was nothing
moued at the hearing
of any of them.
               How is it then, that hee
now acknowledgeth, that he
had ſore offended, in ſetting
ſo light by the ſame? I grant,
that his words were but
froth, and that it was but a
ſudden pang, that cauſed
him to vtter them: but yet
wee ſee, God forced him
thereto; to the end that hee
might thereby bewray his

hypocriſie, when it might be
ſeene that hee amended not
for all that, and alſo to leaue
good inſtruction thereby, to
all poſteritie in time to
come.
            
            
               Doct. 24. The moſt careleſſe hearers, ſhall one day condemne themſelues
               For thereby we may ſee
and learne that how little
regard ſoeuer men haue of
good leſſons, exhortations,
and admonitions, for the
time when they receiue
them (as too commonly we
ſee it to be ſo) yet ſo much
the more they ſhewe themſelues
to be deſtitute of the
feare of God, and bewray
themſelues to be farre from
a teachable minde who doe
ſo, for the time ſhall come,
in which they ſhall finde
great fault with themſelues,
for their ſo doing, and for
their ſleeueleſſe regard that

they haue had thereof, euen
as we ſee that Saul here did;
or elſe they ſhal ſhew themſelues,
to bee in worſe caſe
toward God, then if they
did ſo.
               The many Sermons that
are ſleightly heard and little
regarded, euen as if they
were alſo as little worth
their looſe and negligent
hearing of them, ſhall one
day be cryed out of as faſt,
and the committers of the
ſinne, ſhall caſt it vp, as vnſauoury
morſells, which
men ſhall wiſh moſt hartily,
that they had neuer taken
them in: euen ſo they ſhall
wiſh a thouſand times, that
they had neuer committed
the ſinne. For ſuch may not
thinke that the remembring
of a ſinne afterward, when

God ſhall loade the offenders,
with it, ſhall be like the
time wherin it was committed:
which ought worthily
to vexe the conſcience of
ſuch as can ruſh violently
into many ſinnes, but are
troubled for few: and lay on
loade vpon another, but caſt
off none, who if they iudge
not themſelues before the
Lord iudge them, the burden
will preſſe them downe
ſo,1. Cor. 11. and in ſuch wiſe, as they
ſhall not be able to beare it.
And it ſhall bee as much to
the comfort of thoſe, who
with honeſt and good harts,
heare and receiue the word
now, while it is preached to
them, and feare their owne
frailtie, that they may not
offend. They ſhall not haue
ſuch after reckonings

brought againſt them, as
Saul heere had when he ſaid
to Samuell, I haue tranſgreſſed
againſt thy words: and
as many other haue, who
hoard vp ſorrow againſt
themſelues for long time after,
becauſe they would not
receiue inſtruction a long
time before.
               And this of the firſt of the
two ſpeaches which Saul vttred,
when hee (beſide the
confeſſion of his ſin againſt
God) ſaid alſo to Samuell,
I haue tranſgreſſed againſt
thy words.
            
            
               Doct. 25. The leaſt hope of concealement hardens the hypocrite in ſinne.
               The ſecond followeth
which was this: [I was affraid
of the people] How he
bewrayed his hypocriſie in
theſe words, euen when hee
confeſſed his ſinne, I haue
ſhewed before. The thing

that I note out of them here,
is this: that he thinking Samuell
could not finde out
this that he alleadged, to wit,
that hee feared the people,
whither hee did ſo or no: he
did therefore ſtand ſtiffely
vpon that, although it was
an vntruth that he ſpake. But
heerein is liuely bewrayed a
common ſinne among vs,
namely this: that if an offender
thinke and be reſolued
that his fault be hidden
from men, no perſwaſion
can cauſe him to confeſſe it.
The reaſon heereof in ſuch
is, partly, ſeeing if it be not
wrung from them (which
they moſt deſired:) and
partly ſeeing they thinke
themſelues as ſafe as in a caſtle,
if it bee not knowne,
(ſuch is their blindenes and

hardnes of heart,) whereas
both the Lord hath a thouſand
wayes to bring it to
light, if hee ſee it expedient
ſo to doe; and yet they are
in no ſuch ſafetie while they
conceale it, as they imagaine,
but rather in farre greater
danger, both toward God,
and the world alſo; to God
ſeeing while they hide their
ſinne, they cannot proſper,
neither repent while they
harden their hart: and while
they doe neither of both,
what is their life worth, but
the increaſing of ſinne, and
heaping of iudgement? And
it is worſe for them to menward,
becauſe if it euer after
come to light, they vtterly
looſe their credit among
men, without which, it were
better for them to be baniſhed

from their ſociety, then
to liue with them: And if it
come not to light, yet they
who haue committed it,
walke among men, either
wounded or hardned, but
the leaſt of both is miſerable.
Ananias and Saphira his wife
may exemplifie this more
cleerely, and Gehazai with
many others.
               
                  VERSE. 25.
                  Now therefore, I pray thee,
pardon my ſin, and turne againe
with me, that I may
worſhip the LORD.
               
               Now it is time to paſſe
frō 
                  Saules confeſſiō;The words cleared. let
vs heare of the other good
things, which are heere ſaid
to haue beene in him. The

one was that he asked after
Gods mercy, and the forgiuenes
of his ſinne; and
would haue Samuel go with
him to worſhip God: But
before I goe further, let vs
firſt ſee what his meaning
was, in bidding Samuell take
away his ſinne: ſeeing no
man (as the ſcripture teacheth)
can forgiue ſins but
God only.Mat. 8. The which being
graunted, it is not like
that hee meant as the words
import, that Samuell ſhould
take away his ſinne, but hee
either willed him that hee
ſhould pray to God for him)
[as he was deſired before to
doe for the people of Iſrael]
that he would forgiue him,
or elſe that hee would as
Gods mouth and miniſter,
pronounce him pardoned.

For theſe two wayes, the
Prophet might then, and the
true miniſters may now as
inſtruments, be ſaid to forgiue
and take away ſinnes.
And whether of theſe two
it was he meant, is not materiall.
            
            
               Doct. 26. Gods fauour is pretious to the worſt at one time or other.
               This being thus opened,
whereby wee ſee what his
meaning was; now we may
the better ſee, what is to be
learned from the words.
For this is cleere heereby,
that though Saul did not
feare God vnfeignedly, yet
he ſought now to haue his
ſinnes pardoned, and to doe
other duties to God: which
cleerely ſheweth that there
is a time when Gods mercie
is in price with euill perſons,
and the fauour of God is
ſomwhat with them, though

for a time they haue no ſauour
in them: For what is
the delight of the moſt, but
in that which is tranſitorie,
as profit and pleaſure. But
as ſuch regard not goodnes,
but by fits and in their good
moode, ſo they commonly
haue neuer the fruite therof,
but deceiue themſelues, by
meanes that they haue ſomtimes
good motions. For
their goodnes is like a morning
dewe,
                  Hoſea. 6. 4. as the Prophet ſpeaketh,
whereas it ſhould bee
conſtant with them, and one
time as another. For that
which is good in it owne nature,
is alwayes, and not in
a paſſion to bee eſteemed
and ſet by: for it is neuer in
kinde, but when it is delighted
in. And if that be kinde
ſetting by it, then it is the

due and fit ſeaſon, to priſe
& eſteeme highly of it while
we liue, euen alwayes: as
the Prophet ſpeaketh; to day
if ye will heare his voyce harden
not your hearts.
                  2. Cor. 6. 1. So the
Apoſtle willing the Corinthians,
that they ſhould non
receiue the grace of God (by
which he meant the goſpell,
in vaine:
                  Luk. 19. 41. tells them that it
was the acceptable time for
them to receiue and imbrace
it, euen then when
they might in their health,
and when it was preached
vnto them. And for the neglect
of this, that they did not
know the time of their viſitation,
Chriſt made that patheticall
lamentation ouer
Ieruſalem, ſaying: oh that
thou hadſt knowne in this thy
day, the things that belong to

thy peace, but now they are
hidden from thee! And as
heauenly things, to wit,
Gods mercie, and his true
ſeruice are alwayes to be accounted
of: ſo in what manner
they are to be prized; let
Dauid tell vs in that Pſalme
wherein hee ſeeketh mercie,Pſal. 51. 1
in what a ſeruent manner he
did it: Thus hee faith, Haue
mercie on me [O God] according
to thy great mercy, and
according to the multitude of
thy compaſſions, do away mine
offences. But with griefe I
ſpeake it,Vſe of reproofe. beſide that the better
ſort are too too ſlouthful,
& make too ſmall account of
grace and goodnes: ſo too
many driue them off from
day to day, and ſay they
hope to obtaine them, and
the mercy of God at the

laſt, as well to their contentment
and comfort, as they
who haue ſought them all
the dayes of their life, by
which their ſpeach and practiſe:
they giue fearfull teſtimonie,
that they ſhall neuer
haue any part in them.
Thus much of Sauls words
in ſeeking forgiuenes of his
ſinne.
               Secondly,Hipocrites know what Gods due is, though they delight not in it. note in that he
now offers to goe worſhip
God, that hypocrites know
what Gods due is from
them and how they ſhould
deale with him, in oft and
feruent praying to him, and
walking with him, and that
they do not well when they
doe otherwiſe: yea, they go
farre that way, euery one as
hee hath more knowledge
then other, as alſo may bee

ſeene heere in Saul, who
knew many things concerning
his dutie. But vnleſſe it
be when they are in trouble
or in a good moode, little
ſerueth them, but they haue
ſoone done in any earneſt
manner with ſeruing God:
for it is certaine they haue
no delight therein, but draw
neare to God with their bodies,
their hearts being farre
from him.Mat. 15. And when they
are driuen to looke to their
doings, any thing more then
commonly they doe, they
ſee that it is nothing, well
with them. And if 
                     •
                  hey
could be brought to examination
of them ſeriouſly,
they would condemne their
courſe vtterly: whereby
let them knowe that
their painting and diſſembling

with God) is nothing
leſſe then true ſeruing of
him, and that in ſeeking to
pleaſe him with the worke
done,Vſe. 1. they diſpleaſe him
moſt highly. And let this
be ſpoken to the ioy of all
vpright hearted Chriſtians,
for that their reward is great
with God, how much a doe
ſoeuer they haue with men,
to hold on conſtantly in
their good beginning, but
are diſwaded and diſcouraged.
For in this ſoundnes of
hart (conſtancy in the ſame
being added) in one condition
of life as in another, to
endeauour to obey God,
they doe cheerefully differ
from the other, and are diſcerned
from them. For the
hypocrite, as it is ſaid in Iob,
                  Iob. 27.
doth not ſerue God alwaies,

that is one time as another;
in proſperity as aduerſitie.
               And let this warne vs,Vſe. 27. not
to vſe the holy ordinances
of God, only for a colour, to
ſtop the Lords mouth withall,
and to ſatisfie him therewith,
that is with a forme of
worſhip, which is odious alway,
the heart being hollow
and falſe, but eſpecially
when opinion of merit goes with it.
               
               
                  The words cleared. A queſtion How farre forth we may conuerſe with offendors?
                  
                     VERSE. 26.
                     
                        And Samuel ſaid vnto Saul,
I will not returne with thee:
for thou haſt reiected the
the word of the LORD, and
the LORD hath reiected thee
from being king ouer Iſrael.
                     
                  
                  WEe haue heard how
Saul prayed Samuel,
to goe with him, that hee
might worſhip God, and beſeech
him for pardon of his
ſinne, and it is ſaid here that
Samuel refuſed to goe with
him: this was a ſtrange anſwere
of Samuel, this ſternenes
and techenes of his,
(ſome will be ready to ſay)
is not to be borne, for what
could he haue of him more,
when hee had confeſſed his

ſinne, deſired him to pray
for him, and to go with him,
that hee might call vpon
God? I ſay Samuel (God reuealing
it to him) ſo all this
was but dawbing with vntempered
morter, 
                        Anſwere. 
                      and that
hee did all this, but for the
feare of looſing his kingdome,
not for any wearines
and deteſtation of his ſinne,
for that he extenuated, and
layd it vpon the people: he
did not as Dauid when the
Prophet Nathan came vnto
him, for he freely confeſſed
his ſinne againſt the Lord,
and did not lay it vpon any
other: therfore the Prophet
anſwered, the Lord hath forgiuen
thy ſinne. So durſt not
Samuel ſay to Saul, yea, rather
therefore he refuſed to
goe with him, ſeeing he did

not repent, but dealt hollowly,
leaſt hee ſhould haue
allowed him in his ſinne. I
grant, that which Saul ſaid
was enough to ſatisfice men,
who looke but to outward
ſignes of repentance, and
haue not authority to ſearch
the heart; but God by his
ſpirit reuealed to Samuel a
further thing, which when
he ſawe, namely Sauls hollow
dealing, hee might not
conceale it, therefore he bewrayed
it to him, ſaying, for
all his confeſſion, thou haſt
caſt away the word of the
Lord.
                  
                     A 2. queſtion.But it will be demanded
of vs who preach the goſpel, 
and lay forth this and other
ſcriptures; If Samuel bee
thus excuſed and cleared,
and his action againſt Saul,
                     
defended, it will be demanded
(I ſay) whether we
dare, or may do the like, towards
any great and honourable
perſon, who asking vs
counſell from God, what he
is to doe, to obtaine pardon
of his ſinne, ſhould acknowledge
any diſobedience of
his againſt the Lord, as Samuel
did to Saul: If they
ſhould, they were worthy (it
will be ſaid) to be thruſt out
from hauing any acceſſe vnto
ſuch perſons, to teach
them more diſcretion and
reuerence toward them.
                  
                     
                        Anſwere. 
                      I anſwere: what any of
vs through feare or other
corruption, as flattery, might
be like to doe I will not ſay:
but what wee are bound to
doe, if we had the like light
and knowledge, as alſo authority

and calling from
God to doe a meſſage from
him to any ſuch, I will declare:
and this I ſay; if any
ſuch ſhould giue outward
ſignes of repentance by
confeſſing his ſins, crauing
pardon of God, and our
ioyning in prayer with him,
and ſhould make promiſe of
amendment, it were our duty
to allow of it, ſo farre as
we can ſee and iudge, yea, &
be glad of it alſo, (for where
may wee finde ſo much as
appeared in Saul, in meaner
perſons then kings) requiring
of the partie in the
name of God in all ſubmiſſion,
that hee looke that all
truth and faithfulnes bee
theretoo adioyned, ſeeing
God hath an eye to the hart,
and ſo we are to deale with

meaner perſons alſo: but if
God ſhould reueale to vs,Ier. 5.3. any
apparant ſignes of counterfaite
and double dealing
in him, as he did to Samuel
in Saul, and that we may be
able to conuince him therof
plainely, ſo that hee cannot
deny it; then wee are in no
wiſe to iuſtifie his eſtate, but
hauing a calling thereto, lay
out the dangers thereof,
cleerely and effectually, and
labour that he may ſee, and
ſo lay it nearer vnto heart,
and acknowledge that his
hollow and double dealing
with God,Leuit. 19. that hee may receiue
him. For otherwiſe, we
ſhould hate him if we ſhould
flatter him, and not tell him
of his ſinne and the danger
thereby.
                  Aud by this obiection thusVſe▪
                        
                           •
                        
                     
                     
anſwered, I may fitly take
occaſion to ſhew, and it may
eaſily be gathered, how wee
ought to walke with and behaue
our ſelues toward them
who doe amiſſe, of which
ſort, there are eſpecially
three.Three ſort of offendors, & how we are to deale with them. And firſt toward ſuch
as giue ſmall hope, that there
is any ſoundnes and true
feare of God in them, but
doe ſet a good face vpon
their doings, that they may
be thought and taken for
good profeſſors, although
indeede they caſt away the
word of the Lord, that it
ſhall not rule them,The 1. ſort hollow profeſſors. And
with ſuch wee ought ſo to
liue, that wee offer them all
good meaſure in neighbourlynes,
but not be allowers
of, nor bearers with their
ſinne, nor to haue any ſuch

neare familiarity with them,
that thereby they may bee
emboldened to remaine in
it, as they ſhall eaſily bee,
when they ſhall ſee vs, who
profeſſe the renouncing and
abhorring of all ſin, to be ſo
merry with them, whom we
know to liue in open ſin.
                  And yet, I ſay not, that
wee ſhould diſdaine or contemne
them in the leaſt manner,
though their liues bee
euill, as long as they refuſe
not to heare; but bee gentle
and meek toward them, and
giue them their due, euen the
reuerence that belongeth to
them, in reſpect of their age,
authority, eſtate, degree, or
gifts, which they haue; but
diligently taking heed, as I
ſayd, that wee tolerate not,
neither allow of their euill
wayes.
                  
                     
And ſo doth S. Paul command:
if any that is called a
brother,1 Cor. 6.11. bee a Fornicator, or
couetous, or an Idolater, or
a Rayler, or a Drunkard, or
an Extortioner, with ſuch an
one eat not, neither company:
but as he reſtraineth his
ſpeech, ſo doe I: that if wee
know them not, neither liue
with them, or be not yet acquainted,
though wee liue
with them, wee ſhould not
make conſcience of vſing
them familiarly: for wee
muſt ſhew our ſelues kinde
to ſtrangers, and ſuch wee
muſt hope to win to God
thereby: for els wee muſt
goe out of this world. And
this I ſay of the duties, to the
firſt of the three.2. Sort. Such as offend by weakneſſe.
                  
                  But to goe to the ſecond
ſort: if any of good hope

that wee liue with, doe fall
into any fault by occaſion,
as either by the ſubtill deluſions
of the Deuill, or his
owne fleſh, wee who haue,
by the grace of God, any
greater liberty from ſin, and
haue more freedome to follow
the direction of Gods
Spirit,Gal. 6. 1. muſt labour, and bee
ready to reſtore ſuch an one
with meekneſſe, conſidering
our ſelues, leſt wee alſo bee
tempted in like manner: for,
in ſuch a caſe, we would bee
glad of the beſt aduice and
counſell, and to bee handled
kindely, and faithfully dealt
with, to the end wee might
bee recouered againe, and
comforted.
                  But to paſſe to the third
ſort:3. Sort. Open ſinners. if yee aske whether we
ſhould not alſo beare with

ſuch, as be open offendours,
and caſt away the commandement,Queſt.
as yet, and profeſſe
that they will not bee ruled
by it, leſt if wee winke not at
their fault, our owne ſhould
not be winked at.
                  
                     
                        Anſw. 
                      I anſwer, in no wiſe wee
ought to doe ſo; but caſt
our care vpon God for it,
aſſuring our ſelues that hee
will keep vs from ſuch fearfull
falls, as long as we heartily
deſire to follow the direction,
which hee giueth vs,
and that hee will ueuer the
ſooner giue vs ouer to Satan,Note.
for our hating and diſallowing
of ſinne, in other wicked
perſons. But will keepe
vs the rather, that ſuch foule
blots fall not out in our
ſelues, when wee in a good
conſcience, doe abhorre

them deadly in others.
                  And thus I hauing anſwered,
how wee ought to
behaue our ſelues, toward
theſe three ſorts; I conclude,
that wee ſhould follow Samuels
practice here, toward
ſuch as Saul was, as knowledge
guideth, who did not
neglect, but take an opportunity,
to admoniſh and aduiſe
Saul, ſo long as there
was hope; but when hee
profeſſed to turne from his
ſinne, and yet euen then
dealt hollowly and doubly;
Samuel would not allow,
nor beare him in it, but
ſought to depart from him,
rather rhen hee would goe
with him to worſhip God,
in the caſe hee was in, as hee
would haue had him. Euen
ſo, when men in their words

and deedes, bewray their
treachery againſt God, tell
them of it, as long as they
will heare it; but, if they caſt
that louing admonition off,
and put away the Word of
God from guiding them,
leaue them in it, rather then
haue fellowſhip with them,
that they may ſee for what
cauſe they bee forſaken, and
ſo (if it pleaſe God) they
may come to amendment;
but yet loue and pitty them,
that when God ſhall giue
further opportunity, wee
may doe them good. As
the Apoſtle to the Theſſalonians
exhorteth in the like
caſe.
               
            
            
               
                  Doct. 26. We muſt doe nothing, of which we cannot yeeld good reaſon.
               Thus much of Samuels
refuſing to goe with Saul;
now of the reaſon that hee
rendred, why he would not

goe with him, and that was,
becauſe hee had caſt off the
Word of the Lord. For which
cauſe, the Lord had alſo caſt
him off, from being King.
In which words, conſider
two things, the firſt concerneth
Samuel, the other Saul
From the firſt wee learne,
that wee ſhould bee able to
yeeld a reaſon of our doings
alwayes, and ſhew it alſo,
when it is expedient ſo to
doe. For if we cannot render
a reaſon of them, wee
doe them ſlightly, at leaſt, if
not raſhly and dangerouſly:
ſo that we may bee aſhamed
to men ward, and repent before
God. And that which
S. Peter requireth concerning
our religion and faith;
that we ſhould bee ready alwayes
to giue an anſwer to

euery man that asketh of vs,
a reaſon of the hope that is
in vs:1 Pet. 3. 15 that rule, I ſay, holdeth
with the like equity in
our conuerſation, that wee
ſhould bee ready to giue a
reaſon, why we liue thus, or
ſo; and why we doe this, or
that.
               And the very heathen
Cicero aduiſeth, that a wiſe
man ſhould doe nothing,
whereof hee cannot yeeld a
probable reaſon. All that I
haue ſayd, is to the iuſt reproofe
of ſuch, as haue little
regard what they doe, or
how they liue: who therefore
are of no credit, nor account
with God, or the better
ſort of men, ſeeing they
looke not to giue a reaſon of
their doings. But it is not
meat for wiſe Chriſtians to

hang and depend on mens
mouthes, for the allowance
and commendation of their
doings, whether they bee
good or no: but to goe by
a better rule, to wit, of examining
and obſeruing their
wayes, ſo that they may truly
ſay, they hauing weighed
them in the waights of the
Sanctuary, I meane, by the
Word of God, that ſo they
may be able to ſee, that they
haue done them in a good
conſcience.Pſal. 119. 59. So Dauid conſidered
his wayes, and turned
his feet into the way of
Gods teſtimonies. And they
that iudge themſelues in ſecret
before God, ſhall not be
aſhamed of their doings openly
before men.
            
            
               Doct. 28. Nothing ſhould hurt vs, if wee caſt not off Gods yoke.
               The next and laſt thing,
that I obſerue in this verſe, is

that which concerneth Saul:
that Samuel ſayd to Saul, ſeeing
thou haſt caſt away the
Word of the Lord, he hath caſt
away thee, that thou ſhalt not
be King ouer Iſrael, ſo that if
he had not done ſo, neither
ſhould hee haue beene caſt
out of his Kingdom. Where
it is manifeſt, that if men did
not as Saul, reiect the Word,
ſo that it cannot gouerne
them,Mat. 11. 29 and if they did not caſt
off Gods yoke,Pſal. 50. 16 hating to be
reformed, they ſhould haue
no cauſe to cry out, as they
doe, of the heauy puniſhments
which they meet
with, and take hold of them,
but reioyce and praiſe God,
for his many and great bleſſings.
So faith the Pſalmiſt:Pſal. 81. 13.
                  Oh that my people would haue
harkned vnto me, and that Iſrael

would haue walked in my
wayes! I would ſoone haue
brought low their enemies,
and would haue turned
my hand againſt them. But
this, euen this, that men will
lye ſtill in their ſinne, and
hold it faſt, as the childe
doth the ſweet ſugar in
the mouth,Iob 20. is the cauſe
of all their complaints
of ſore afflictions,Note. and loſſe
of their beſt commodities;
and heauy dayes, which
though wee ſhall neuer bee
free from altogether, no not
the beſt, while we carry fleſh
about vs; yet wee might remedy
it in great part, if God
had any authority, & might
preuaile with vs. And if his
owne children will rebell,
and breake out of compaſſe
to prouoke him, he will chaſtize

euen them with his
ſmarcy rods and corrections.
Euen as the Lord ſpake
by the Prophet Obadiah,
                  2 Chron. 15. 1. to
Aſa King of Iudah, ſaying:
O Aſa, and all Iudah, and Beniamin,
heare yee mee: The
Lord is with you, while yee bee
with him; if yee ſeeke him, he
will be found of you: but if ye
forſake him, hee will forſake
you.
                  1 Pet. 4. 18 If God then will execute
puniſhment vpon his
owne people, prouoking
him: what maruell is it,
though they bee loden with
iudgements, who are none
of his,2 Chron. 19. 2. but his enemies?
And further then both the
one and the other, doe humble
themſelues, to walk with
the Lord, they ſhall euer be
in danger (as they may here
ſee in Saul) of loſing their

beſt iewels. Of which I
ſpeake the leſſe here, hauing
handled it before in another
doctrine.
               
                  VERSE 27, 28.
                  And as Samuel turned about
to goe away, hee layd hold
vpon the skirt of his mantle,
and it rent.
                  And Samuel ſayd vnto him,
The LORD hath rent the
kingdome of Iſrael from
thee this day, and hath giuen
it to a neighbor of thine,
that is better then thou.
               
               IN this diſtreſſe and perplexity
of Saul,
                  The text opened. that hee
feared the loſſe of his kingdome,
and yet could not
hold the Prophet with him,
when he turned to goe from

him, Saul caught hold of his
garment, and it rent; this he
did not in wrath againſt him,
for then he would haue vſed
great cruelty toward him; as
Ieroboam in the like action,1 Kin. 13. 3.
intended againſt the man of
God: neither did hee it, as
teſtifying his earneſt deſire,
to bee counſelled and
directed by him, which hee
refuſed all the time the Prophet
was with him (neither
did he afterwards any otherwiſe)
but he did it, onely to
keepe him in preſence with
him; which, if hee might
haue done, hee thought all
ſhould haue beene ſafe and
well with him. For, he imagined
there was no cauſe of
feare, while Samuel was in
place and company with
him, and by that meanes, he

thought to quiet himſelfe,
and to put away all ſuch
thoughts, as through the
meſſage which hee receiued
from God, might haue held
him in great vnquietneſſe,
whereby hee ſhewed how
loth and vnwilling hee was,
to haue him depart from
him. Which affection of his
had deſerued high commendation,
if he had deſired Samuels
ſtaying with him, for
the right end, to wit, that he
might haue been to vprightneſſe,
and true repentance.
            
            
               Doct. 28. Hypocrites may aſcribe much to the means.
               But it is cleere, that hee
was farre from it: but yet
ſeeing he went about to ſtay
him, what may we learne of
that, yee will (perhaps) aske,
and what vſe ſhall we make
of it? I ſay, we learne thereby
this, that though hypocrites

haue not a ſound and
vpright heart, yet they will
aſcribe ſomewhat to outward
meanes, as to hearing,
and to the prayer of the lips,
and to this among the reſt,
that they may bee well
thought of among the godly,
and therefore they will
haue them ſometime in their
company.
               And why doe they ſo?Note.
verily not to bee reformed;
no, nor to be ſoundly informed
by them: but they
thinke, that for their ſo doing,
they are the better, and
that God will ſo account
of them: and they flatter
themſelues in this, that they
are herein before others: thus
meaſuring themſelues, by
thoſe which are worſe then
themſelues, which is a falſe

rule to goe by: wheras they
ſhould propound to themſelues,
the beſt examples to
follow, as they follow Chriſt,Mat. 11. 29
yea and Chriſt himſelfe and
his doctrine.
               But they imagine, that as
God will heare them, for
their much babbling; ſo he
will ſaue them, for their accompanying
ſomtime, with
better men then themſelues.
And thus wee may gather,
not onely by Saul, and many
among vs; but by the
thoughts of them in the laſt
day; who looking to be receiued
of Chriſt, for ſuch
duties doing, alledged this
[Lord] we did eat and drink
in thy company: but Chriſt
anſwering them, Depart from
mee, declared that they
ſhould alſo haue ſauoured

of his company, and haue
ſhewed, that they were therby
reclaimed from their euil
wayes, or elſe it was to ſmall
purpoſe to ſay, they were in
his company. So the Lord,
by S. Iohn,
                  Reuel. 2 5. threatning to remoue
the Candle-ſticke out
of the place, except they amended,
did not only quicken
vp the godly thereby,
but alſo awake and admoniſh
the wicked, that the Goſpell
ſhould bee taken from
them, which they could not
abide to heare of.
            
            
               
               Doct. 29. More doe frequent good company, then profit thereby.
               
                  VERSE 27.
                  And as Samuel turned about
to goe away, he layd hold vpon
the skirt of his mantle,
and it rent.
               
               BVT to paſſe to another
thing, who ſeeth not
that this was extreme folly
in a wiſe man, that he could
not but hold him in his company,
and yet neuer the better
for it?2 Kin. 3. 15. So Iehoraem could
could bee content to ſerue
his turne with Eliſha the Prophet,
in his ſore diſtreſſe and
danger, that hee was in: but
otherwiſe regarded no whit
his doctrine, nor meſſage, to
be reformed by it: but rather
hated him. Euen as Ahabal,
ſo his father was willing

to haue good tydings by
Michaiah,
                  1 Kin. 22. when he went to
war at Ramoth Gilead; but
hee was ſo far off, from hearing
the iudgement of God,
for his idolatrie and diſobedience
at his mouth, or to
bee willing to bee conuerted
from it, to the true worſhipping
of God, that he ſent
him to priſon with hunger
and paine. Euen ſo it is, I
muſt needes ſay, the heauy
hand of God vpon many among
vs, and a point of
groſſe fooliſhneſſe, though
otherwiſe they haue wit and
worldly wiſdome with the
moſt: that notwithſtanding,
they bee no Papiſts, to contemne
and deſpiſe the Preachers
of the Word, yet they
are not wiſe enough to make
their profit of them: nay,

though they loue them, as
they doe other men; yet do
they not ſeeke to know the
end, why they are ſet among
them, and what vſe for the
attaining of happineſſe, they
ſhould ſeeke to make of
them.
               It was reuealed by God,Corrupt ends of mens conuerſing with the Miniſter.
in ages paſt, though now
more plainely in this latter
age of ours, that Prophets
and Preachers, ſhould be receiued
for their office and
meſſage ſake, which is, that
they bring tydings of bleſſedneſſe,
to be enioyed both
here, as Luk. 11. 28. and hereafter
for euer, as Luk. 1. 69.
but how doe people, for the
moſt part, regard and embrace
this meſſage of God,
by their miniſtry? many of
them will, to get a good penny-worth

in his tythes, at a
good Miniſters hands, hold
in and keepe in fauour with
him; and if they obtain that,
they will ſpeake well of him:
others for ſome qualities of
his, wherewith they are delighted;
as that hee is a fit
companion for them at play,
a merry conceited perſon,
and can diſcourſe well and
wiſely of worldly matters;
for theſe and ſuch like they
affect him.
               And another ſort, if they
haue one that beareth the
name of a learned man,
though he bee little conuerſing
with them, or doe them
little good, will perhaps glory
of, and commend him,
though they care not whether
hee teach them or no.
               That I ſay nothing of the

ignorant and inſufficient
Miniſters, with whom yet,
many are as well content (if
not better) then with the
ableſt and beſt. But what is
all this? this is not to receiue
him for his office ſake and
Miniſtry, as our Sauiour teacheth
men,Mat. 10. to receiue a Prophet
in the name of a Prophet,
that ſo they may haue
the reward of a Prophet.
And thus men ſuffer themſelues,
to be groſſely bewitched,
that Saul was neuer
more palpably deceiued, in
laboring to haue Samuel with
him (when yet hee ſought
no ſpiritual counſel, or comfort
at his hands) then the
moſt are in our dayes, that
like and allow of the Miniſtry,
perhaps though many
doe not ſo, and yet ſhall bee

found (if any liſt to examine
it) not to looke to be enſtructed
by them,Acts 26. 18 nor turned
from the power and dominion
of Satan, to the ſincere
loue and obedience of
God, neither to bee called,
and brought from darkneſſe
to light, to faith and knowledge,
which are the ends,
why the Goſpel is preached
among them; but onely in
ſome ſuch reſpects, to like
and receiue them, as I haue
before ſet downe.
               But is this the manner of
accounting the Miniſtry and
Miniſters, as Gods holy ordinance,
and his ſingular
gifts? is this to make propheſie
and preaching precious?
Is this to account and
eſteeme the tydings of the
Kingdome of Heauen,Mat. 13. as a

pearle? for ſo the Scripture
cals it) is this, to receiue
Gods holy Meſſengers, as
Angels; and to ſhew, that
their feet, or comming, is
beautifull; becauſe they
bring a glad meſſage, and a
meſſage of peace vnto them?
Is it to loue, and eſteem them
ſo, as for their ſakes, to bee
ready to plucke their owne
eyes out, if need were, for
the ſingular benefit, which
they receiue at their hands,
and by their meanes?
               It doth well appeare that
the neare coniunction of
true and chriſtian loue betweene
Gods faithfull miniſters
and their flocke,The true ends of this fellowſhip much neglected. which
alſo ought to be betwixt all
teachers, and the people
committed to their charge,
is either not knowne, or not

greatly in practiſe: And if
the true ſhepheard (as Chriſt
teacheth) will ſo loue his
flock,Iob. 10. 5. as he will looſe goods
and life for their ſake, if occaſion
ſhould be offred; and
if they bee like affected to
him, is there not (thinke we)
ſome great matter betwixt
them, which cauſeth this?
And what is it? the naturall
father, and ſonne are not ſo
nearely vnited as they: yea,
greater things are enioyned
of one by the other, then betwixt
them: for the father
is but the meane of his ſons
being at all; but the ſpirituall
father is the inſtrument of
his euerlaſting welbeing: he
can only conuey or leaue to
his ſonne, his temporall poſſeſſions
and goods; but this
is a meane whereby eternall

riches, yea, a kingdome and
that eternall, is enioyed by
them whome hee begetteth
by the goſpell: againe, their
loue can bee but naturall,
therefore not euer firme and
ſtable, but the loue of theſe
is ſpirituall, and therefore
endureth: and ſuch louing
and liuing together, ſhould
be betweene the one and the
other: which I ſay, becauſe
the blinde and the beaſtly
world, who knoweth no
whit of this, when they ſee
faithfull loue betwixt the
teacher and people, doe to
their further condemnation,
reproachfully vtter theſe
ſpeaches, that the people
make their miniſter their
God: but while they thus
ſpeake, we may ſee that they
ſee cauſe to loue them, and

that there is another end
why the ſhepheards of
ſoules ought to bee deſired
and enioyed, and another
manner of benefit to be reaped
by them, then either
Saul, or ſuch as I haue ſpoken
of, haue found: which therfore
ought of all the people
of God heereafter to bee
ſought and looked after.
            
            
               Doct. 30 The hypocrite may alvvay look to heare bad news.
               
                  VERSE. 28.
                  And Samuel ſaid vnto him,
The LORD hath rent the
kingdome of Iſrael from
thee this day, and hath giuen
it to a neighbour of
thine, that is better then
thou.
               
               IN the former verſe wee
haue ſeene how Saul
                  
ſought to hold Samuel with
him, but not for the end
which ought chiefely to
haue moued him: and in
this 28. verſe, Samuel takes
occaſion by the rending the
lappe of his garment, to giue
ſignification to him, that
God would rend his kingdome
from him, that ſo hee
might make no doubt, but
that it ſhould come ſo to
paſſe: And this hee did that
he might haue driuen him to
ſome ſounder and hartyer
diſlike and confeſſion of his
ſinnes, (though wee ſee hee
preuailed not with him)
therefore hee thus ſpeaketh
to him, as we ſee fearefully;
and as well it teacheth al that
liſt to learne, that while men
remaine hollow and double,
and deale not truly and

plainely with God, they may
look to heare no better then
heauy tidings from him,Note. to
ſound in their eares, and to
checke their conſciences,
whatſoeuer faire ſhew they
make of any repentance,
but to gather more ſignes
then before of their damnacion,
by how much more
they reiected Gods offers in
calling them:1 King. 13. And ſhould
not this driue men from all
their carnall ſhiftes,Vſe. and broken
holdes, when they ſee
that God hunts them out of
their dennes, and pluckes
their mufflers from their faces?Chap. 14. 34. 35.
And yet as bad as Saul
was, and as little as God ſet
by all the outward ſhewes
that he made either heere, or
in the former chapter, verſe
34. to the 46. (which were

many) yet it is cleere and
moſt manifeſt,Many that make ſome ſhew, yet come farre ſhort of Saul.
                   that he went
farre before many that profeſſe
the Goſpell at this day:
among whome a man may
be a long time, before hee
ſhal heare ſo many holy and
religious ſpeaches, as he vttred
there (reade the place)
beſides his vpholding the
true worſhip of God, in the
which he declared his zeale
in ſeuere puniſhing ſuch
as ſhould diſhonour him,
yea, although it fell out to
be his owne ſon. I ſay there
be many found among vs,
(who haue cleerer knowledge
of Gods will, then
was reuealed to him) who
yet neither may be matched
with Saul in ſundry commendable
points, neither in
this one, to attribute ſo much

to Samuel the Lords Prophet,
as he did: who deſired
his company, and held him
with him. Which though it
was not done in faithfulnes,
with deſire to bee reformed,
yet who doubteth but that
it was a good ſteppe to take
profit by him in time, when
he could yeeld him ſuch reuerence
as he did, and giue
him leaue to ſpeake to him
of the matters that were
both harſh, toyliſh and vnpleaſant?Note well.
And yet wee ſee
for all this, God had no
pleaſure in him, that all who
ſhall heare or read this ſtory
or the laying open of it, may
feare and tremble, if their
righteouſnes and ſynceritie
exceed not his; for no ſuch
ſhall enter into the Lords
kingdome;Mat. 5. 16. which was one

eſpeciall end why I lay out
this ſtory before the eyes of
men, as I ſaid in the beginning.
Neither let any obiect
and ſay,Obiect. that his eſtate was
fearefull afterwards: but
now when this was done,
which is heere mentioned,
he was not ſo deſperate and
paſt hope: 
                     Anſw. 
                   for I ſay that for
the acts heere and before
mentioned, (take one with
the other) he was caſt off, although
it is to bee granted,
that afterwards hee was
much worſe. Let no man
deceiue himſelfe, Samuel
was forbidden to pray for
him, at his departure from
him, at the time heere mentioned,
as appeareth in the
next chapter, verſe 1. for at
his departing from him after
he had done the Lords meſſage

to him, which I haue
now ſpoken of, hee left him
no better, then at his comming
to him hee found him.1 King. 13. 34.
But as it was ſaid of Ieroboam
(when the man of God
had reproued his Idolatrie
threatning him ſore in the
name of the Lord) that for
all this he departed not from
his euill way: So it is ſaid of
Saul, that when Samuel went
away from him, he was nothing
bettred, nor reclaimed
by him, ver. 34. after which
going from him, it is ſayd he
came no more to ſee him,
vnto the day of his death.
And as for that it is ſaid of
him in 30. verſe of this
chap. that hee confeſſed his
ſinne againe, as he had done
before, leaſt any ſhould think
his latter confeſſion to haue

bene better then the former,
it is branded by the holy
ghoſt, with a manifeſt marke
of hypocriſie, when he ſaid
I haue ſinned, for this is added
[but honour me before
the people] ſignifying that
he looked not ſo high as to
God,Pſal. 51. who requireth truth in
the inward parts, but only
his feare was, leaſt men
ſhould haue knowne that
God reiected him, and ſo
might thereby haue caſt him
off, and haue refuſed him for
their king. And of Saul thus
much, for I haue ſaid the
beſt of him, that the ſcripture
ſets downe in this chap.
or afterwards, and ſhewed
that nothing ſpoken of him,
ſauoured of true repentance.
The further we proceede in
this ſtory, the worſt we ſhall

finde him. And firſt how he,
by and by after Dauids victory
ouer Goliah, beganne to
recompence his good with
euill, hating him without
cauſe, and ſeeking to kill him
ſecretly, as in the 18. chap.
appeareth, and then openly,
as in the 19. may bee ſeene,
& that many times in both,
and ſo continued to his end,
worſe and worſe.
            
            
               Concluſiō of the whole, with ſerious application.
               And now I haue ſatisfied
the deſire of ſuch as were
earneſt to haue the chiefe
points of this chapter opened,
concerning Saul, that
they may ſee his ſinne, both
when he ſtood in the denyall
of it, and when he confeſſed
it: I haue ſhewed alſo in the
proceſſe of the ſtorie, as occaſion
hath beene offred,
how fearefully many of the

viſible Church, doe very
nearely follow him, & liuely
reſemble him, (if many of
them go not beyond him in
their euill actions and liues,
and come ſhort of him in
their good parts) to this end,
that if they haue any care of
their ſoules welfare, they
may more ſeriouſly thinke
of their eſtate while they
haue time, and come to true
repentance. Rather learning
ſo to doe, by the good teaching,
and the examples of
godly Miniſters and Chriſtians,
then to diſgrace them
as much as in them lyeth and
diſcourage them, as it is too
common a thing for many
to doe. Now I ſay it remayneth
that wee pray earneſtly
to God, that this and ſuch other
ſcriptures, being written

for our inſtruction and
edifying, may by his gracious
working in vs, do vs the
good, for which wee enioy
them: that as they be lights
to our ſteps, and lanternes
