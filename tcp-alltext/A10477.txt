                  If Pherecrates had now liued, well and truely might he haue haue preſented herTerent.

                  And (if euer) this braine-ſicke Age wherein we liue, may beſt teſtifie her miſery; for neither Her ſelfe, nor her Lawes are regarded euen of her Children, but moſt led by their ſtragling paſſions runne after their owne rebellious Imaginations; which doth breed a miſery of miſeries vnto Her, great griefe and ſorrow to her true borne Children, and to all, a baſe wretched Eſtimation, aſwell amongſt thoſe who know her Eminencie, as thoſe who neuer knew Her, nor any other vertue.
                  And if we ſhall finde (as certainely finde we ſhall) in one member of Her, in one little part of her Praecepts, ſo many erroneous and repugnant Abſurdities committed, what ſhould we meete with, if we did ſearch into her whole Body? ſurely ſuch a contumelious Inſurrection, that either for Ignorance or ſhame in ſo much wronging Her, we muſt ſtand obſtinate, and ſet Her at defiance, or with peaceable vnderſtanding ſubmit ourſelues to Her Cenſure, checking our

And when their humours are to be beſotted with the Soule-rauiſhing pleaſure and content of melodious Harmony, they ſeeke either by diſſembling Commendations, or groſſe Flattery, or the like, (by any ordinary capacity quickly conceiued) to grieue and diſcontent thoſe outwardly, who affoord them delight, and contentment inwardly.

                     THe ten-fold Orbes of Heauen are ſaid to moue
                     By Muſicke; for they make Harmonious din:
                     
                     And all the Powres ſubordinate aboue
                     Spend Time, nay, ſpend Aeternity therein.
                     
                        If Muſicke then, moue all that All doth moue;
                     That's not compriz'd in ALL that ſpights her State:
                     If not in ALL, it's nought; which who doth loue
                     is worſe then nought, to loue what Heau'n doth hate:
                     For, NOVGHT is nothing; ſith it was not made
                     By that great WORD, without which made was nought:
                     Then, if that nought but NOVGHT doe her inuade,
                     Like God, her goodneſſe is ſurmounting THOVGHT!
                     
                     But no man is ſo ill that hath no good;
                     So, no man in the Abſtract can be nought:
                     Then 'tis no man that hates ſweete Muſickes moode,
                     But Some-thing worſe then all that can be thought.
                     A Beaſt? O no: A Monſter? neither. Then
                     Is it a Deuill? Nothing leſſe: for, theſe
                     Haue Beings with an Angell, or a Man;
                     
                     But that exiſts not, that ſweete Notes diſpleaſe.

                     Then Men WERE not, had they no Soule (their Forme)
                     But Muſickes haters haue no Forme, nor Soule;
                     
                     So, they (like Sinne) exist but to enorme,
                     For, had they Soules produc'd in Harmony,
                     
                     Or rather Are it ſelfe (ſome Wiſe auouch)
                     They would be rauiſhe with her Suauity,
                     
                     And turn'd Coeleſtiall with her Heauenly Touch!
                     
                     But, let them goe as more than mortall Sinne
                     
                     'Gainſt Wiſedomes Spirit, not to be forgiuen:
                     While thou doſt wooe the Soules, which thou doſt winne
                     With thy ſweet Notes (deere Friend) to mind but Heau'n.

                  THE PREFACE.
                  
                     
                        MUſicke in ancient times, was held in as great Eſtimation, Reuerence, and Honour, by the Beſt vnderſtandings and Nobleſt Bloods, as any Science Liberall whatſoeuer. The Graue Philoſophers reputed it an Inuention of the Gods, which they had beſtowed on Men, to make them better conditioned, then bare Nature affoorded: And the Wiſe Grecians therefore educated their children in it, that by meanes of it, they might temper their mindes, and fully ſettle therein, the Vertues of Modeſtie and Honeſty: and, (in a word) all of worth euer held it, a very Direct and Neceſſary courſe, for the beſt Inſtitution of Life, and Correction of ill manners.
                  
                  The Cauſes then of that Diſrepute, and ouer lowe Eſtimation, which Muſicke in theſe dayes, (for the moſt part) ſuſtaines, and whether they proceed from Corruptions of Nature, or Art, or both, as long ſince I began to meruaile at, ſo had I now vttered ſome obſeruations thereabout, had not counſaile, and diſcretion perſwaded me a while for a further exact ſuruay.
                  I had then (amidſt other things) vnfolded on the one ſide, both the Naturall, and alſo the Politick Affector and

                  I had likewiſe poynted at ſome other abuſes, committed and ſuffered by Muſicks Profeſſors, as well in Eccleſiaſticke as Common Seruice, whereby the one, findes his Due Right empay

                  As for thoſe common kinde Practitioners, (truly ycleped Minſtrells, though our City makes Muſitians of them) who making account forſooth to doe the Art Honour, now in theſe daies of the ill opinion, and ſmall credit it beares, haue (fairely) brought it downe from a cheife Liberall Science, to the baſeſt almoſt of Mechanick Functions: I make no queſtion, but in good time it may returne vpon their owne necks, and their Deſert be rewarded, as Statute in that caſe hath already (moſt worthily) prouided.
                  Beſides, I ſuppoſe I ſhould hardly haue omitted the Beleefe (whereof I finde ſome Aery or Inſtrumentall Compoſers and Practitioners to be) concerning certaine Vices, which their Ignorance is perſwaded, our Art receiues helpe by, how diſagreeing ſoeuer, both to Nature and

                  And then for amends of all, I ſhould at laſt, haue affoorded ſomewhat in the generall precepts, both of Plaine, and Meaſurable Muſick, in the many Diuerſities, which the Nature of Compoſitions giue vs, from the very originall of them, to

that excellencie, wherein the Art is now to be found, and in divers other particulars tending to the ſame effect.
                  But now in the meane time, let the Affector ſhew his Diſpoſition, and the Profeſsor his Art, to both whome I promiſe, that when e're I proceed in it, I will be free and impartiall, as Rule and Reaſon onely giues me, laying my Obſeruations, and ſo deſiring (if it may be) the reſtitution of our Science, to Due, and ancient Honour.
                  And till then (if at all they loue the Art) they ſhall well accept of my good will, and (with me) take in good worth, theſe various Sprightfull, Delightfull Harmonies, which now I bring them. Their Compoſure I dare warrant, 'tis not onely of Ayre, made for ſome ſmall tickling of the outward Sence alone, but a great deale more ſolide, and ſweetly vnited to Number, Meaſures, and Nature of the Ditty. The earneſt affections which a man hath, in the vſe of ſuch Recreations as they are made for, are ſo fully expreſt in them, for Tact, Prolation, and Diminution, that not onely the Ignorant Eare muſt needs be pleaſed with them, for their Variety of ſweet Stray

                  I will take ſo much Iudgement vpon me, as to affirme, I finde a great part of them ſo, though (without any tryall) the very Naming of thoſe two Worthies in their Art, and Times, (and eſpecially in theſe kinds) who firſt Compoſed that part I now ſpeake of, is warrant inough for ſuch a Beleefe of them Maiſter Edward Pearce the firſt, ſometimes Maiſter of the Children of Saint Paules in London, and there my Maiſter, a man of ſingular eminency in his Profeſſion, both in the Educating of Children for the ordering of the Voyce ſo, as the Quality might afterward credit him and preferre

                  The ſecond I name, as partner in this worke, is Maiſter Iohn Bennet, a Gentleman admirable for all kindes of Compoſures, either in Art, or Ayre, Simple or Mixt, of what Nature ſoeuer. I can eaſily beleeue he had ſom what more then Art, euen ſome Naturall inſtinct or Better Inſpiration, by which, in all his workes, the very life of that Paſſion, which the Ditty ſounded, is ſo truely expreſt, as if he had meaſured it alone by his owne Soule, and inuented no other Harmony, then his owne ſenſible feeling in that Affection did affoord him.

                     Theſe Ligatures were inuented for two reſpects: 1. for the Ditties ſake 2. (without Ditty) for breuity of Pricking.

Minimes, and into 2. at the leaſt, and term'd it Prolation; but as for the Minime, not counting otherwiſe of it, then as of an Vnite, or a Poynt in Geometry, he reckoned it no Time, but the beginning of Time, and the very beginning of Meaſurable Muſicke; and ſo in theſe dayes further then the Minime the Meaſure tends not, it being the firſt and ſhorteſt Note that any Meaſure can begin on; as contrarywiſe the Large is the laſt and longeſt Note, that the voyee of man with one Breath can deliuer.
                     And as for our Crotchets, Quauers, & Semiquauers, I yet finde not the Inuention of them; and therefore I ſuppoſe no great heede was taken of the Inuentor, yet they were accepted vpon ſufferance; yet ſo, as that we now differ from the auntient in the naming of them,

For that I may giue inſtance herein, I finde it by them thus exampl'd 𝇊3 or thus 𝇊3, the which indeed I muſt confeſſe is the Imperfect Time, and the More Prolation; But then I demannd to what end t

                           nds that Ternary Number? Hereto they will anſwere (eſpecially thoſe who in conceyt are Maſters) that it is to ſignifie a Triple Proportion, by which the Song before which it is ſet,

muſt be ſung; and that is (ſay they)3. to one. True; but then aske them what three to one? and they will tell you, 3. Minimes to one Semi-breue; O moſt Vnproportionate Cuſtomable Compoſitors, whoſe Art ſerues them not ſo much as to diſtinguiſh Prolation from Proportion! For Prolation is, when 3. Minimes goe to one Semi-breue, and Triple Proportion is, when 3. Semi-breues to one Semi-breue, as being a Proportion of the Greater Inaquality, and (as wee terme it) Multiplicis generis, that is when a Greater Number is compar'd with a Leſſer, and containeth the Leſſer many Times as 3/1 6/2 9/3 &c. It is euident then, that this ſingle Ternary Number cannot ſtand for a Triple Proportion, ſeeing it wants a Leſſer Number to bee compar'd with all; and beſide that, were there a Number adioyn'd, yet the ſigne of the Imperfect Time, the Perfect Prolation, 
                           
                              Ornitho. lib. 2. cap. 8. (and Number cannot work vpon Prolation ſo long as the Circle retaines the Poynt,) the Charactering of the Note in white, the breaking of the Meaſur'd Notes, and the Meaſure of a Leſſer Quantity and Quality to the Tact, would all reſolue vs, 'tis no Triple Proportion.
                        
                        Others then being beaten from that opinion, and yet not doubting but to hit the marke, make anſwer; Some, that the Number is there ſet to ſignifie, that 3. Minimes went to a Semi-Breue, in their idle conceites neuer remembring that the Poynt in the Semi-Circle ſignifies that ſufficiently: Some, that it is to ſignifie the Moode, not regarding that the Meaſure it ſelfe confutes them, in as much as this Ternary Number ſignifieth Perfection, and the Moodes in this Meaſure are Imperfect. And laſtly, Some (rather then faile) will haue it ſignifie Time, quite forgetting (as good Authors obſerue) that 'tis the Circle which ſignifies it, which being broken in this Meaſure, makes it therefore Imperfect.
                        
                        May I not then wel conclude, that ſeeing this Number ſignifieth neither Proportion, nor Prolation, nor Imperfect moods,
                           
nor Time, 'tis but an Intruder, and by right muſt be wholy left out in the Meaſure of the Perfect Prolation? which being graunted, I will ſay no more of it, as making account that it is a thing generally knowne.

                            ſhall be Iudges, who knowe the Meaſure to bee all one, and the differences of the Motion to bee according to each Rule, or according to the diſcretion of them that Sing, or Reade them.
                        But the matter here we chiefly ſtand vpon is, that the Ternary Number ought vtterly to be reiected, as hauing no manner of intereſt either in the Perfect Prolation, or the Diminutions therof: The Perfect Prolation we ſpake of before; and now for the Diminution thus I ſay, that if by their Trochaick reaſon they will bring this Ternary Number in, to ſignifie

this Diminution, they may as well, yea they muſt neceſſarily, to euery diuiſion of the Semi-breue, (which may bee as diuers, as is the Compoſers Inuention) ſet a ſeuerall Character to ſignifie it, and their applications of it to the feete, by which it is Meaſured: But what a confuſion would that be to the Performer, (beſides the euidence of their ridiculous ignorance) to charge each Diuiſion with a particular Character, when only the Externall and Internall Signes ſet at the beginning of Harmonyes are thereto ſufficient? And if it bee vnneceſſary to Charactere all, I ſee as little reaſon that they ſhould Charactere any one: Or if yet they needs▪ will, that one be Charactered, then let them ſhow me, why the Meaſure of theſe other feete, which belong to the Diuiſion of the Imperfect Prolation and the Diminutions therof, (as Spondaeus, Pyrrychius, Anapaeſtus, Bacchius, Antib

For if they hold that a thing needleſſe and ſuperfluous to be done in a caſe ſo common and obuious: the conſequence will be altogether as good againſt this their Poeticall, phantaſticall Charactring with the Ternary Number.
                        
                        But ſee how one errorbegets another; It is that which I haue obſerued as a moſt groſſe Abſurditie in the pricking of the Internall Signes of this Diminution, and yet is to be found among thoſe, whome our Vulgar Practitioners account approued Maſters, & in that opinion haue followed their Vn-art-like Example; which is, the ſetting of it with a White Minime and a Crotchet, and the Tact charactered with the aforeſaid Ternary Number; as thus

                        But what a confuſion will this be when they haue a Song or Tune compoſed of all theſe Tacts, (as diuers there are in vſe for Maskes and Reuells) and ſhall finde but onely one Character to expreſſe all Motions? how can that worke be perform'd in his proper nature, except the Compoſer ſhall either Demonſtrate by a Canon what his meaning is, or himſelfe perſonally be there to explaine his Forme intended? Therefore the Authors of our Art, foreſeeing the Diuerſities (ànd there by the Abſurdityes) which heerein would be inuented concerning the Diminutions of the Tact, agreed vpon certaine Rules and Characters together, to Demonſtrate euery particular Motion by, of what kinde of Diuision ſoeuer the▪ 
                           Tact was. But now in regard that thoſe Canons and Proportionate Rules are out of vſe, I ſee no reaſon why wee ſhould vſe their Characters, but rather be led by that Rule, where of now in theſe dayes our practiſe

conſiſts, which is the Circular Rule, and by which this leſſer Diminution of the Perfect Prolation (the Internall Notes being Denigrated) is thus Charactered.

                     AMongſt other liberall Arts, Muſicke for her part, hath alwayes beene as liberall, in beſtowing her melodious gifts, as any one whatſoeuer, and that in ſuch rare manner, for diuerſitie: and ample meaſure, for multiplicity, as more cannot be expected, except it were more then it is reſpected: yet in this kind onely, it may ſeeme ſomewhat niggardly and vnkind, in neuer (as yet) publikely communicating, but alwayes priuately retaining, and as it were, enuying to all, this more familiar mirth and iocund melodie. But it may bee Muſicke hath hitherto beene defectiue in this vaine, becauſe this vaine indeed, hath hitherto been defectiue in Muſicke: and therefore, that fault being now mended, this kind of Muſicke alſo is now commended to all mens kind acceptation. This did I willingly vndertake, and haue eaſily effected, that all might equally pertake of that which is ſo generally affected. Catches ſo generally affected (I take it) quia non ſuperant captum, becauſe they are ſo conſonant to all ordinarie muſicall capacity▪

Good Art in all, for the more muſicall▪ good mirth and melodie for the more Iouiall, ſweet harmonie, mixed with much varietie, and both with great facilitie. Harmony to pleaſe, varietie to delight, facilitie to inuite thee. Some toyes yet muſicall, without abſurdity, Some very muſicall, yet pleaſing without difficulty, light, but not without muſickes delight, Muſickes pleaſantnes, but not without eaſines, what ſeemes old, is at leaſt renewed, Art hauing reformed what pleaſing tunes iniurious time and ignorance had deformed. The onely intent is to giue generall content, compoſed by Art to make thee diſpoſed to mirth. Accept therefore kindly, what is done willingly, and publiſhed onely, to pleaſe good Company

                        SEcundae cogitationes are euer (they ſay) meliores; and why may not then ſecundae Cantiones be as well dulciores? I preſume they are ſo, and that makes me reſume this vaine, with hope that I ſhall not conſume in vaine my labour herein.
                  For firſt, the kinde acceptation of the former Impreſsion is as a new invitation to this latter Edition, though not of the ſame things, yet of things of the ſame condition; full of the ſame delectation, made to pleaſe, as the other were; to pleaſe I ſay, and that with as much eaſe, as the other; made truely Muſicall with Art by my correction, and yet plaine, and capable with eaſe, by my direction.
                  
                  Againe, Bonum quò communius eò melius, we know; and I know no reaſon, why incundum, quò communius, ſhould not be as well iucundius: Now then the nature of theſe (call them as you will) in regard of their facilitie and ſo their capabilitie is more communicable, then any other kinde of Muſicke▪ and in this reſpect more

                     commendable; and will be I am ſure more acceptable, becauſe the things which many heretofore haue priuately ioyed in, may now by this meanes, publikely be inioyed.
                  
                  Neither, can he, that is the moſt able Muſition ſay, but that of theſe moſt men, almost all men are capable, that are not altogether immuſicall: Neither can He, that is moſt ſpitefull ſay, but they are very delighfull, I, and ſome way gainfull too; (yet more painefull to me, I am ſure, then gainefull.) But, though there bee but little to bee gotten by them, yet pittie were it, ſuch Mirth ſhould be forgotten of vs; And therefore to make an end, I ſay no more but—Siquid nouiſti dulcius iſtis.
