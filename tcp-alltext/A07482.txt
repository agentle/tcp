            To the right worſhipfull Maſter Edward Stanley Eſquire.
            
               SIR, were I not more comforted with aſſurance of your Generous diſpoſition, than perſwaded of anie merit on my part, by offering the Patronage of this Hiſtorie to your hands; I ſhould as certainly diſpaire of the acceptaunce, as I am vncertaine whether it bee worthie to bee accepted From the time of my firſt entraunce in Printing till now, it is the firſt Booke of this kinde I euer had power to dedicate, from my firſt yeres of capacitie to read anie printed thing, my affectionate dutie hath to your W. been dedicated.
            
               Enisham one of your Lordſhips was my

birth-place; and as my Frends there pay dueties for the place they liue in, ſo tender I this here as part of my duteous loue.
            The Authour of the Booke hath left it to the wide world without a Patron, perchance eſteeming it vnworthie protection: neyther doo I thinke it in the leaſt part worthie your protection, before whoſe excelent iudgement (ſo daily conuerſant among the moſt iudiciall) it cannot but vaniſh like light ſmoake before a bright flame. All my excuſe is loue, all my requeſt is pardon; which as (I firſt inferd) your noble diſpoſition aſſures mee of. On which foundation building, I ceaſe now to bee more bold.
            
               
                  Your VVorships, moſt dutifully affectionate: Iohn Danter.
            
         
      
      
         
            The famous Hiſtory of Chinon of England, Sonne to Lord Cador Earle of Cornewall, with his rare atchiuements for faire Celleſtina daughter to Lewes King of Fraunce.
         
            CHAP. I.
            
                How Chinon the Earle of Cornewalles Sonne was borne a foole, and of the excellent ornaments of nature wherewith his faire Siſter Laura was beautefied.
            
            
               IN the beginning of this flouriſhing Kingdome, when Arthur then Monarch of this little worlde, with his attendant Knights, whoſe valorous exployts euery where acted for theyr Countries honour, hath eternized their euerliuing names, euen in the fartheſt coaſts of the barbarous Pagans, where yet in deſpite of conſuming time liues their eternal Trophies as ſpectacles for all poſteritics.
            
               In this time liued there in England an auncient Knight, whome this famous king for his many merits and well deſeruing déedes, had inſtalled in the Earledome of Cornewall, a dignity as hee thought fitting the deſerts of this famous man, that had ſo often vndergone the furious attempts of the vnciuill Pagans, enemies to God, foes to his countrie, and great hindrances to the then but young plants of ſpringing Chriſtianity, as alſo endeuoring himſelfe euery where to defend the fame of his countrie, then of all other only fame worthy the Honour of his order euery where honored, and the dutie belonging to his Knighthood, which hee alwaies performed, till at the laſt when the waight of many wearie yeares, gan bow his declining bodie downe to the lowly earth, making his oft tried Armour too heauie a burthen for his now war weakned body, his brandiſhing ſword beating downe his age fallen armes, and euery ſupporter of his luſtie limmes beginnes to faile of their former force, he determins to end his life in peace at home, whoſe beginning he had ſpent in warres abroad, incouraging younger men with the ſpectacle of his former valours, couragiouſly themſelues to attempt the like indeuors.
            In which time of his home aboad, the heauens bleſſed him with two goodly Children, a Sonne & a Daughter: but yet as it is the continual courſe of al ruling fortune to mixe with euery good ſome ill, with euerie ſwéet a ſowre, & with euery ſunſhine ſhow of promiſing hap, a tempeſtuous ſtorme of ill boading hurt, ſo fared it in the iſſue of this yet vnhappie Prince: for when the ſtealing houres of all ripening time had brought them from their Infant Cradelles to ſome participation of ſencible knowledge, his Daughter whoſe name was Laura, ſo forwardly proſpered in euery Liniament of her beautifull bodie, & all eternall quallities of a vertuous minde:

ſo that in ſhort time ſhe became the cenſured ſubiect of all wiſe iudgements, in determination whether nature had better beautified her bodie, (where indéede ſhee had excéeded her ſelf) or the Gods quallified her mind, wherin they had made her the only ſimilitude of themſelues. No penne that was not buſied in painting her praiſes, though all too little for that purpoſe, and no tongue but was ſtill telling her perfections, though they neuer could attaine them: for too bright was her beautie, to be ſhadowed in the couloring cunning of a mortall capacitie, and too high her heauenly minde, to be enſtauld with the earthlie wéedes of mans baſe wit, that as the toile ſome Sailers in the dangerous Seas watching the miſfortunes of a tedious night, doth with themſelues mightily admire the gorgeous ſtate of many twinckling ſtars, till when the ſiluer Moone proudlie riſing from her glorious bed, drawes backe their daſeled eies to behold her more than common countenance: ſo fares it in this age of theirs, where no ſtarre may compare with her ſtate, no face with her faire fortune, nor no grace with the leaſt glimce of her glorie: ſo to leaue to expreſſe that in wordes, which could not bée comprehended in all wits, neuer did nature before compoſe of ſo rude a Chaos, ſo comely a creature: But her Brother whoſe name was Chynon, outwardly formed in as faire a faſhion, as might well beſéeme the ſonne to ſuch a fire, but in his minde more than a maimed man, wanting that portion of ſenſible capacity which commonly doth accompany euen the meaneſt ſeruillitie: So that by how much his Siſter excéeded in extraordinarie wiſedome, by ſo much was hee ſcanted in ordinarie witte, where in ſtéede of Princely feature, was nothing found but fooliſh behauiour, for high atchiuementes boyiſh follies: for that which is required in a man, not ſo much as is commonly found in a childe, vncapable of the rudiments of good

counſaile, and vnſit to conceiue the commoditie of comelie quallitie: whence as all men with admiration wondred at the one, ſo none but with commiſſeration pittied the other, that ſo well faſhioned a body ſhould containe ſo ill formed a minde, ſtrongly had nature forged hys limbes, which promiſed his valour, but weakely had the enuious Fates framed his mind, wher was no hope of better, So that heere nature vnnaturally handling ſo good a ſubiect, had encloſed in the perfecte body of a man, little better than the vnperfect ſoule of a beaſt, like almoſt the imitating of an apiſh artificer, that in faire ſhowes deciphers a formall ſubſtance, in curious cunning colours painting a Princely perfection, which ſatiſfies the outward ſence as the ſame, but cannot content the inward conceit, beeing but a bare ſhow: So by euery outward appearance was he iudged well, till triall by experience to euery one proued him worſe, but how great a corſiue it was to his careful Parents, I leaue it to thē to conſider whom experience hath taught to conceaue the like inconuenience, great griefe was it to his old father that had béene himſelfe full of valour, to ſée his young ſonne though able, yet vnfit for any ſuch endeuour, which turned his hoped for reſt to hapleſſe ruine, his aged mirth to angrie moane, and what ſo euer other content, into a contrarie conceit, to ſée his poore neighbours comfort their ſeruile liues with the ſight of their forward Children, and hee their vnfortunate Lord wanting that redreſſe which thoſe poore creatures in reſpect of him in ſuch plentifull manner do daylie poſſeſſe.
            Thus grieuing to remember that which hee cannot forget and ſorrie to haue ſo diſcontented an obiect to his aged eies, which he ſtil be wailed, though by no meanes his griefe could be healed, atlaſt learnes with patience to beare that which with paines he cannot amend, and

inſtantly ſolicites the great Parlament of heauen, in whoſe diſpoſe reſts the eſtate of all creatures, that in their vnſearchable wiſedome they woulde either open the eyes of his blinded ſoule, forged in the miſtie vale of a cloudy ignorance, or els cut ſhort the vnpleaſant date of his wearie life, and ſo preuent the inſuing ignominie of his future times: where wée muſt now leaue him a while in his follie, till the proceſſe of our Hiſtory bring vs thither againe.

                How two of King Arthurs Knights, ariued in Earle Cadors Court, and how Launcelot du Lake obtained the Ioue of faire Laura.
               
            
            
               DUring which time this young Ladie Daughter to this worthie Earle Cador, with the report of her matchles beautie, reſounded in euery eare the welcome ſounde of ſelfe pleaſing loue, and thereby incited many aduent

ſo filled their longing eares, as doth the neuer moouing pole drawe the adamantine touche of euerie ſtéely compaſſe, ſtill to direct their purpoſe to one point, ſo fared it here, whether declines the glance of al eies, the thoughts of all harts, and the aime of all actions, amongſt whom arriued two Knightes of the honourable order of King Arthurs rounde Table, which was then ſo fullie furniſhed with a peareles troupe ef couragious Cauiléers, as iuſtly compared with all countries for like company, whoſe names were Sir Lancelot du-lake, and Sir Triſtram du-Lions, two wonders for their worthines, matchles for their might, and for their curteſie excéeding compare: who amongſt many millions of other braue Gallants there all for one purpoſe aſſembled, proudly oppoſes themſelues againſt all approaching powers both of forraine and homeborne foes that durſt any way ſet themſelues againſt her Soueraignetie, wherein they ſo valiantly behaued themſelues, eſpeciallie Sir Lancelot du-lake, whoſe vndaunted courage ſtroke ſuch terror to the hearts of his foes, and won ſuch fauour in the ſight of his friends, as hee was generallie admired of all, but eſpeciallie of Laura whoſe maiden heart béeing nowe touched with the pricke of affection, receaued ſo déepe an impreſſion, as could neuer after be raced forth againe, and looke as there is no ſubſtance without his accident, no fire without his ſmoake, nor ſhadow without his body: ſo is there no loue how cloſely ſoeuer it bée ſhadowed, howe cunningly ſoeuer it bee diſſembled, or how farre ſo euer remooued, but will by ſome meanes manifeſt it ſelfe, which in her proued true: for though her modeſt countenance bluſhing, aſhamed at firſt to diſcouer the earneſt affection of a ſo ſoone conquered louer, labored what in her lay ſtill to repres her new mounting thoughts winged with the aſpiring defence of a reſtles louer: yet like fire the more it is kept

downe the fiercer it riſeth, floods the ſurer they are ſtopped, the ſooner they ouerflow their bankes, and windes the greater that are their oppoſitions, the more furious are their forces: ſo fared it with the laboring heart of this lawles louer, ſometimes determining to diſcloſe with her tongue what lay ſo hid in her heart, and then ſhe bluſhed for ſhame: then determined to ſmother it in obliuion; and then lookes ſhe pale as fainting in diſpaire: no minute but there entred into her minde the thought of a thouſand doubtes, no doubt but redoubled her trouble ſome thoughtes, and both more and more dou

               tes, ſtill increaſes ſhe vnquenchable fire of her loue-thirſting ſoule.
            In that thinges by howe much they are hard to compaſſe, by ſo much are more worth being once compaſſed, gladly would ſhe forget that which moſt ſhée delighteth to remember, faine would ſhe ſhunne the ſnare that ſhée ſo willingly runneth into, and deſires to winke at that ſhee doeth moſt deſire: On the other ſide the worthie Knight diſpairing of his good fortune, or els doubting his former force, grew with melancholly demeanor to ſpend halfe in diſpaire, the dayes hee was wont to ouerpaſſe in the fulnes of deſire, thinking eyther her affections were els where ſo throughly ſetled as could not be ſeuered, or his worth merriting demeanor deſerued not ſo much as a fayre aſpect from thoſe powerfull plannets that guides the diſtreſſed eſtate of his ſicklie ſoul. Looke as a weary wayfaring man, that tired with the toilſome labor of a tedioust auaile, diſpayring with in his time to enioy the end of his iourney, and therefore vſeth a ſpéedier pace to perfourme his purpoſe, ſo fares it with the ſtill troubled minde of this diſtr

with a ſeuere ſentence, would rather pronounce his death than promiſe his life, determined with himſelfe how he might doe his endeuour to obtain her frendly fauour, which with long conſultation hee thus concluded, namely to vndertake ſome hardie aduenture, & dedicate his labour to her loue, and ſo if peraduenture the happie courſe of all helping heauens did ſo proſperouſly further his attempts, as that in his wearie plotted way, hee might but fortunately finde any worthie worke, whoſe conqueſt might deſerue commendations, he fed himſelfe with this hope, that the ſetled perſwation of his ſure loue confirmed by the dangerous endeuors of his longing life, perfectly preſented to her memorie, by the atcheiuements of his worthie victorie, wold ſomwhat aſſwage the fury of her contemptuous conceit, & if not at the firſt win her, yet by little & little weare out the blot from her memorie, that detaines his loue from her minde: yet leaſt his abrupt departure might be a greater cauſe of his diſgrace, hee determined before hee went to paint forth that paſſion in the vnbluſhing lines of an amoreus letter, which he could not diſcloſe with the inforſiue words of a pittie moouing louer, & therfore ſequeſtring himſelfe from the reſort of all company, hee thus in pittiful termes diſcouers his pure loue.

vpon ſtately Stéedes, ſtout of courage, able of limmes, and beauteous in ſhow, attended onely with two Pages, who for that purpoſe they had appointed, takes vppon them the neareſt and directeſt way that bordered vpon that coaſt where they lately landed, & ſpending the partching heate almoſt of a whole ſommers day wandring through deſart woods and manie vnpeopled plaines: till when the ſweating Horſes, of the weary ſunne ſwiftly deſcending from the higheſt top of that heauenly hill, whence in his glory hee ouerlookes the mightieſt mountaines that the earth affordes, & by their fiery tract ſummoned the ſilent night vp to her wearie watch, they began to looke out where they might eſpy any conuenient place for their purpoſe, where that night they might repoſe themſelues to reſt.
            At laſt after much curious ſearch deſcending down into the pleaſant bottome of a lowlie dale, where by chance ran from forth, the bowels of a mighty mountaine, a coole freſh ſpring, whoſe ſiluer current ſhadowed ouer with the heat expelling power of thicke tuffted trees, refreſhes the increaſe of all adioyning vallies, who weary with wandering, and willing no thing more than ſuch pleaſure as there was plentifully promiſed, they alighted, and rayning all their horſes to the big bowes of an aged neighboring Oake, gins with the freſh coole current of that pleſant ſpring to alay the thirſt of their hot ſtomackes, where they had not long ſolicited themſelues in the ſhade after their great trauaile, but that an auncient Hermite inhabiting the deſart roomes of that unaccquainted corner, walking his accuſtomed iournie, by chaunce lightes vpon theſe wearie knights, as they were cooling their weake limmes in the delightſome depth of that pleaſant ſpring, who as ioyfull to ſee ſome creature,

of whome they might be better directed for the furderance of their affaires, as the other was willing to ſupplie their wants, with that poore prouiſion that himſelfe wanted not, they with curteous ſalutation entertaine him, and hee curteouſly regréeting them with the like wiſhes of good lucke, requires what, whence, and who they were that had ſo farre wandred from the beaten wayes of thoſe wide Deſarts, to whome Lancelot with reuerent regard to his olde age, mildely anſwers that they were two Knights of the round Table, aduenterers in Armes, that had for the honor of their order, the credit of their countrie, & the loue of their loue worthy Ladyes, vndertaken to trauaile euen as far as ſunne and ſeas, the one would giue them light, and the other afford them land.

            Next him came many other of whome were too long ſeuerally to dilate.

himſelfe in ſo great a daunger of deuouring death, & out of all hope of the pittifull compaſſion of his eager enemie, beganne againe to rouſe himſelfe, and ſpéedily preparing his ſtrong fencing furniture, ſo aſſay the fortune of a furious fight, caſting ouer his ſhoulder a large ſheltering ſhield and brandiſhing in hys hand a kéene edged Turtle-axe, gins no we a foote to aſſayle him, that before on Horſe backe hee did aſſault.
            When Lancelot perceaued it, he prouided himſelfe for the like purpoſe, and couragiouſly encounters this harme hammering Heathem, where betwixt them againe beganne a farre more fiercer fray on foote, then was cruell encounters before with their Horſe, which continuing very long on both ſides confirmed with the fierce falles of their vnwildie weapons, makes at length Sir Lancelot du-Lakes armes (weakned with the iſſue of much blood, that the Pagan had ſpilt with his blowes) almoſt to faile of his former forces, which béeing eſpied of the Chriſtians, and eſpecially of the King, who aboue all other, deſpiſed a Pagan ſhould poſſeſſe ſo Princely a Prize, as they had there prouided, gins euery where to enquire of that Knight, on whoſe ſtrength almoſt nowe depended their whole eſtate, to whom at length word was brought that it was a Knight of King Arthurs round Table, whoſe name was Sir Lancelot du-Lake, to whome all the Confines of Chriſtendome hardly in Chiualrie afforded a fellow: which ſtroke ſuch a diſmall dumpe into the moodie minde of this diſcontented King, to ſée the Champion of Chriſtendome ſo néere vanquiſhed, vnder the pittileſſe power of a moſt helliſh heathen, as almoſt driues the bright Roſiall colour from his afore well coloured Chéekes.
            
               Till when this ſtill triumphant Knight ſhakeing himſelfe as from a ſluggiſh ſlumber, reaches at the Pagan with ſuch power, as that at one blow with his well tempered ſword, hee quite cuts a ſunder the ſtrong turret that hemmed in his head, & ſettling further downe to his harmefull head, batters a ſunder the ſiluer wall that ſhieldes the principall partes of ſoule ſeruing ſence, and the reſt remayning remnants of that little world, wanting the direction of their greateſt guide, altogether faile any further to ſence their fainting fellowes from his battring blowes, which ſight bred no ſmall content to the almoſt ſickly ſoule of the King, who expected nothing leſſe then the ſo ſpéedy death of his ſpitefull foe, who béeing by the conquered diſarmed of his rich habilliaments, was by the reſt of his company quickly conuaied to his curions Tent, and all his attendants ſent home with ſorrow, that whilome flouriſhed in ſuch hope for felicitie.

               ndeuours, he ſuddainelie ſollicited his old ſorrow tyred ſire, that hee would thus far further his intent, as to graunt him leaue a while to forſake his natiue ſoyle, and learne thus to aduenture for honor in far forraine lands, whoſe inſtant intreatie not brooking the deferring of further delay, earneſtly vrged his now more fortunate Father to further ſo his forward Sonne, as that preſently prouiding all ſuch neceſſaries as to him was moſt néedefull, without any more meanes made for his bootleſſe abode, fitly furniſhed him in euery point for ſuch a purpoſe: where euery neceſſary being prouided, and himſelfe now readie to depart, bleſſed with the many praiers of hys ioyful father to ſée hys forward ſonne recouered from the helples horror of darke ignorance, to the approuing proweſſe of Princely puſance, and with the well willing wiſhes of all his friendly fauorites, he departs his home to ſéeke his ſo long loſt glorie abroad.
            Meane while whileſt thus Lancelot has ſent ouer to hys Miſtris the afore named fauors, ſpéedy preparation was prouided in Fraunce for the ſolemnezing of this Royall marriage betwixt Sir Triamore, and faire Celeſtina: which for that his father then reſident

vpon his Dukedome, was deſirous to content his old conceit with the ſight of his ſonnes marriage: Syr Triamore earneſtly intreated of the King, that he would ſo farre further his olde fathers requeſt, as to licence their departure home into Brittanie, whereto the old King willingly condiſcended and moſt Royally furniſhed this their ioyfull iourney: whither being attended with ſir Lancelot du Lake, and ſir Triſtram du Lions, beſides many other aſwell valiant Knights as beauty brauing Dames, drawen out from the chiefeſt choice of all that Countrie, merrily ſets forward on their way.

            Long time they ſpent in diſputing what were beſt to doo in this extreame danger, themſelues being ſore wounded with the many blowes of their ouer numbred foes, their Armour bruſed with the oft falling forces of their Foe-mens ſwords, and their weapons almoſt all broken in this barbarous battell, incites to their ſadde thoughts what ſecure meanes they might ſéeke for their beſt ſafegard.

and after he had long time climed vpō the ſide of this mount, at length with many wearie ſteps he attains the toppe: from whoſe height hee might againe looke backe at his ouerſpent iourney: following a longe while the broad tract of that beaten way, preſentlie he came to a narrow cut of paſſage out of the ſide of a flintie Rocke, where the high hill stéepe ore his head, troubles the courſe of the winde wandring cloudes, beneath the lowlie bottome of a blacke diſmall Dale, filled with the furious force of aſpyring ſprings, that working from the wombe of the ſea, euen vnto the higheſt toppe of that mightie Promontany, breaks out againe, and with a fierce fall downe into the diſmall Dales, makes ſuch a hidious noyſe: as when the vnbridled force of the ouerflowing ſea breakes downe the boundes of his neighboring bankes, and drownes all the nere placed plaines, with his euerworking waters: Yet Chinon ſtill hoping that after ſhowers, at length would come a ſunne; after woes, weale; & after theſe hard paſſages pleaſanter plaines; with as much patience as hee could, ouergoes this griefe he had, and gins at laſt to ſée the farther ſide of his wearie way: from whence looking downe, hee might eſpie a more pleaſant dale, whether deſcending by a downe falling path that went into the bottome of a Hill he gladly at length attained, and there in a more freſher and pleaſanter ſtreame than before of a long time hee had met withall: hee ſome what refreſhes himſelfe, and beeing content with ſuch fruit as that ſoyle did afforde him, hee goes forwarde on hys iournie, ſtill ſearching for that hee coulde not finde: At laſt he came as hee thought to the mouth of ſome Caue that was fullie filled vp with the ſtronge bulke of a mightie bigge ſtone, whoſe hugeneſſe was ſuch as could not be remooued by the might of manie

men, where in olde almoſt outworne letters, were theſe lines ingrauen.
            
               In priſon here a puiſant wight,
               Betraied by cunning craft now lies:
               Whence no man but a maiden Knight,
               Can free him from his miſeries,
               Whoſe firſt tried valour muſt aſſay,
               To rid this wretched man away.
            
            Which when he had red and curiouſly conſidered, gins to reſolue with himſelf, to aſſay whether his fortune ſhould bee ſo good as to performe this ſeruice, where looking round about for him that did heere in a peremptorie painted challenge kéepe the paſſage of that place, where this Knight whereof mention was there made, is by ſubtiltie incloſed, at laſt ſodainelie, but from whence he ſaw not, there was a huge deformed Monſter, ſuch as before he ſeldeme or neuer had ſéene, whoſe ſhape neyther imported the proportion of man nor beaſt, but a mixture of them both: from foorth the furnace of whoſe fierie bellie, iſſues like the aſhes of Aetna, many cloudie miſts of darke ſmoke, that almoſt ſmoothered this famous follower of hardy déedes before he began the fight, and in this Fogge armed with the bulke of a yong ſpringing Dake, the fell force of whoſe fall, had béene ſufficient to haue ground him a ſunder, gins vnawares to aſſaile him: which when perceaued, nimbly leaping backe to eſchue the heauy ſtroke, prepared in as ſhort ſpace as he could to prouide himſelfe for this fray, but ere he

the ſecond time to aſſault him, which he in the beſt ſort he could deuiſe, ſought meanes to eſcape, for to vndergoe it he could not: and then nimbly conueying himſelfe within the ende of his mighty weapon, with his well tempered ſworde gins aſſay to worke vppon the Monſter, but all in vaine, for ſo ſtrongly was it euery where buckled with inſconſing ſcales, as no more entrance was affoorded for his ſword, then if he had ſtroken vppon the hard face of a flinty Rocke, when the ſubtle ſerpent with a ſodaine turne gaue the Knight ſuch a heauy blowe with the poyſoned weight of her ſtrong tayle, as perforce beat him downe to the grounde, and almoſt baniſhed the breath from his body: But hée mindfull of what hée had in hande, to encounter ſo vnnaturall an enemie; long lyes not in that caſe, but nimbly rouſing vp himſelfe againe, gins freſhly to aſſaile his enemie: who ſtill threatning him with the bigg blowes of his vnwieldy weapon, puts him euery way to his ſhi

               t how he might beſt ſhun them.
            At laſt ſpying a fit oportunitie, he with his ſword indeuoured to cut aſunder her vnacuſtomed kinde of weapon, which in ſhort time he performed, ſo that now frée meanes he had for to aſſay what he could doo vppon her vnwieldy body: But all his labour was loſt, for ſo ſafely was ſhée garded from all entrance, as not the kéeneſt ſtéele the ſmoakie Cyclops forged for the mighty God of wrathfull warre, could euer enter into her: when hée troubled at once with two illes, the furious force of her ſerpentine taile, which now prooues her beſt weapon, and the brimſtone flaming which ſtill iſſued out at the Furnace of her fiery mouth.
            At the laſt after much labour, the weary Knight tyred almoſt with this tedious toyle, gins ſomewhat

to returne backe, to the end he might recouer againe his nie loſt breath: which flight for that the Serpent did not with ſuch eager force purſue, as ſhe was went to doe in the beginning of their fight, hee made longer ſtay to recouer thereby better ſtrength, & then as two furious fighting Stagges that fetching a farre flight, thereby to encounter with more force, begins againe theſe new olde enuies and with their furious blowes ſo plagued one another, as if the oppoſition of two great Armies had ſent the noyſe of their battering Armes from euery reſounding eccho: till at length after the many fierce aſſaults of the furious Knight, hys foyled enemie in a ſudden as ſhe came, vaniſhes away, which he ſuſpecting but to be ſome diueliſh deuiſe, with an intent to ſet vpon him againe at vnawares, gins circumſpectly to prie into euery corner, to the end he might be ſure that no intrapping ambuſhes of her hobgoblin companions, might priuily lurk to inſnare his life: when vnwares he perceaued the mighty ſtone ſo meruailouſly laid ouer the Caue of it ſelfe to roule away, and from foorth the hole iſſues out thrée goodly Knights, two whereof he knew, for hys Countrymen and olde acquaintance: but the thirde which was a ſtranger he neuer ſaw before, theſe wer they of whome we ſaid afore were by the ſubtill ſhift of a deceauing Syren, cunningly compaſſed in that Caue: where when Syr Lancelot du Lake and hys fellow Triſtram ſaw Chinon, that at their departure from England they left fooliſh in their friendes, & his fathers houſe, miraculouſly tranſformed to a valiant Knight, and ſo luckily there ariued, for their reliefe: no maruaile if with admiration, theyr woondering wittes were drawne into a laborinth of ſuch deepe conceites, how this might come to paſſe; that béeing amazed as were thoſe ſtone turned people, which gazing

vppon Gorgons heade, coulde hardly beléeue in their mindes, what was ſo liuely preſented to their eyes, till Chinon perceiuing their paſſion, gins thus to waken them from their drowſie and ſluggiſhe dreame.
            Fellowes in Armes (quoth hee) the very reporte of whoſe valour hath from the heauy weight of obſcure follie, rowſed my deade drooping thoughtes to the liuely remembrance of a higher mounting mind, not happier ſhall you be in this your releaſe, than I in bringing you reliefe; in that the ſucceſſion of after growing ages, ſhall eternize my name for the opening of this worſe than helliſh mouth, and for the vanquiſhing of that more than miraculous Monſter, for that by the one I againe reſtored to the world two ſuch valiant Knights: and by the other, rid them of a peſtilent plague.
            Stand not in a maze, for I am the man that lately you left in a world of follie, but now by the power of prouident heauen, raiſed from that deiection. At laſt Lancelot (ouercloied with ioy to ſée him thus fortunate, that whilome was ſo fooliſh) regréetes his good hap with many ioyfull wordes, ſuch as commonlie paſſe betwixt long parted friends at their vnexpected méeting, and then ſir Triſtram likewiſe ſalutes hys honorable aduenture, with the many great thankes and good wiſhes of like future good fortune: then ſir Triamore for that he

gins certeſſe him in euery point according to hs aſking, which when ſir Triamore vnderſtoode that hée was a Knight of comely carriage and curteous demeanor, he forthwith with many gentle gréetings and more thankes to heauen and him for their happy deliuerie, vowed vnto him all the honor of his actions: Who long profeſſing kindly friendſhippe and duteous indeuor, to deſerue this more then common curteſie, they were preſented with a troope of Fairies; mongſt whome was Oboram there King, who eſpecially chooſing Chinon from the reſt, began with many wordes of woonder to commend his Cheualry, for that laſt being his firſt Combate, he had ſo valiantly behaued himſelf, as had all the chiefe choiſe of powerfull Chriſtendome ſtroue with themſelues to haue excéeded his worth, their Forces all ioyned in one, in reſpect of him had béene none: And then turning to the reſt of the Knights, tolde them that the Monſter by whoſe deuiſe they were there deceaued, was no other than himſelfe, who for the deſire he had to approue the Proweſſe of this newe come Knight, vndertooke that ſhape, in requitall of which wrong he had prouided a coſtly ſword, which by his Art was faſtned within the cloſe binding body of a ſtrong Rocke, and he of them that ſhould ſtoutly pull it out, ſhould for his paines inioy a Jewell of rich price: which ſword was artificially framed for Julius Caeſar, by the cunning craft of a migh

            Thus after their long walke in thoſe cloſe kept countries, hee brought them at length into a broade vale, in midſt whereof was grauen vp a mighty ragged Rocke, wherein was a faire faſhioned ſword curiouſly contriued of many ſundry mettals, which ſhould ſeeme by ſome or other meanes to haue béene ſtroken thereinto, where this fairie King told them they were all to approue their forces at the pulling of it, and he whoſe lot it ſhould be to win it, for his pains ſhould alwaies were it, whoſe temperature was ſo good as would clearely cut a ſunder what euer, ſtone, mettall, or any harder obiect was oppoſed againſt it, the vertue this, that whoſoeuer wore it ſhoulde neuer be aſſailed by baſe croſbiting of anie ſlie deceitful Inchanter.
            And thus with many words extolling the excellencie of the thing, and promiſing good fortune to them whoſoeuer ſhould attaine it. Hee firſt appoints Syr Lancelot, who as gréedie of this goodly weapon, as a hungrie hauke of her pray, ſtoutly ſteps foorth, and laying hold of the ſword with a maine force, offering to vnſheath it, could nothing at all remoue it.

teares of true ioy to proſtrate her ſelfe at his honorable féete, whoſe force had againe reſtored her from the tedious ſlauerie of loathſome captiuitie, to the pleaſant preſence of life féeding libertie, vowing deuoted ſeruice for this her ſecond life: But Chinon diſdayning that the foule faced earth ſhoulde enioy ſo much as touch of her heauenly hew, with gentle intreatie rayſes her vp, and thus replied to her ſuppliant ſpéech.
            Fairer quoth he than is the common compoſition of earthly creatures, and therfore of more worth than millions, if I haue ought done in this that hath bred thy content, it is no more than the beſéemeth the dutie of my degrée: Then doe not thus attribute more honor for my méede, than is due by deſerts to my deed: more is thy ſmile towards the reward of a well deſeruing worke, than the rich rewards of many millions of an others vowes, more pleaſant is the ſight of an houres ſunne, than the ſhow of twenty ſhadowed daies: but thy ſight excéeding the brighteſt ſhining ſunne, that day is at the mid dayes height the pearcing beames of euery bright eyes ſight, more welcome to vs, than day to the wearie watch, or the repoſe of a quiet Inne to a tyred trauailer, graceſt our paines with thy preſence.

Labours hee atchieued): thence if thou canſt but fetch it away, it wil be the only meane to worke my releaſe, and end thy long deſires and tedious labour.
            Where too the yong man attentiuely harkening, as one that longed to eterniſe his name to ſuccéeding poſterities, for the perfourmance of ſome ſuch famous Worke, makes ſmall delay to proſecute this buſines, with comfortable promiſes of fairer dayes, cheering and comforting her minde, leaues her to the mercy of

ſtormes calmes, and after frowning aduerſitie ſmyling proſperitie: and ſo on a ſudden vaniſhed away. When he (ſéeking vp and downe for her, whome by no meanes he could find) wondring how ſo rare beutie could be bred in ſuch a homely ſoyle, whereas the Earth was vnfruitfull for want of tillage, the Trées vnorderly bearing frute for lacke of pruning, and the ſeuerall Beaſts diſagréeing in their owne kindes for want of ordering: plainly the true definition of ſolitarie deſolation, that oft abounding in all things, is cauſe of decay to euerie thing. At laſt as hee wandered along the Riuer, he heard excellent muſique, and a more excellent voyce tune forth this Ditie.
            
               How ſweete a thing is this Content
               To which poore countrie Swaines are born?
               Theſe falls of Fortune they preuent,
               And other hard miſhaps doo ſcorne.
               Oh how thrice bleſſed had I beene,
               If (but obſcurde in countrie weedes)
               Thoſe mightie men I nere had ſeene,
               Whoſe loathed loue my ſorrow breedes?
               But ſuch is the vnconſtant ſtate
               Of this ſtill-changing Worlds delight,
               Making the meane a Princes mate,
               Croſsing high hopes with low deſpight.
               Which makes my Soule (in ſad deſpaire)
               Die here ten thouſand times a day,
               Woond vp within a world of care,
               Whence nought can it releaſe away.
            
            
               When hée following the ſound of the voyce, at length found her where ſhe was ſitting in the hollow ſide of a Rocke, hemmed round about with a ſhow of ſuch creatures as her ſelfe, to whom Chinon ginnes thus to bewray himſelfe.
            Ah thou more than thy ſelfe, in that thou retaineſt too heauenly a forme for anie earthly frame. How impartiall are the Fates that turnes the neuer ſtanding Whéele of Fortune, to grace with ſo continuall a Sunne this Soyle, and lowre with obſcure ſhowres on other places. Goddeſſe of theſe Plaines that giueſt more grace to theſe fields, than did the Goddeſſes to the place where they pleaded for the golden Prize. Hadſt thou liued in thoſe dayes when young Apollo loued, then hadſt thou béen the Paramour of Learnings Prince, and guided his will that now gouernes the World. For thy ſake am I tranſported from the furtheſt place of the wide weſtern World, into theſe cynged Plaines of euer ouer dried Egypt. For thée will I follow the aduentures of Armes, ſo that when for thy ſake I haue ſought the World, and with my ſword engraued (in neuer changing characters) thy God like name in the fartheſt corners of all-bréeding Earth, where no conſuming fire, cutting ſword, nor eating eternitie ſhall euer weare awaye thy memorie: ſo that for my labour thou wilt reward me with thy loue.
            When with excéeding paſſion he had deliuered theſe ſpéeches, with more than common admiration he pauſed, like one that were ſuddenly amazed wyth the ſhowe of ſome vnacquainted ſight, ſtood a long while as in a traunce: when as the wylie Witch perceiuing this new come Companion likely to marre what ſhee and falſe Peroſus (by their practiſes) had béen ſo long a making, beginnes to take once more

the charge of her tongue, and thus boldly begins to tie him to his taſke.
            Faire Knight quoth ſhee, whoſe willing minde to doo me ſeruice, wins more reward than I am able any wiſe to beſtow: If I were what now I am not, then would I doe what now I doe not, with fauour requite thy forward fortunes: but thus it is, and then ſhe begins in a long Hiſtorie to relate her frowning fortunes. Firſt drawne from the Court, then perforces long time by her ſelfe to dwell ſolitarily vpon that vnpeopled ſoyle, and laſtly when ſhee began to comfort her ſelfe with that country content: then ſolitarily to ſhut her vp in that place, where was no paſſage for any people to come to her, and ſhe depriued of all power to come out to them, & then telling how there reſted no hope of redreſſe, if that for her ſake ſome mighty man would not vndertake a trebble taſke, worſe than tormented Siſiphus hys toyle.
            Which words wrought ſuch a deſire in the minde of this forward Knight, as vowing to performe more mightie deedes than thoſe déedes of the olde Giantes that heaping hill vpon hil aſſayd the height of heauen, he inſtantly begins to intreat that in this her charge, ſhe would admit of him as her Champion.
            At which wordes the Hag that all this while had hid her ſubſtance in an inuiſible ſhade, gins vrge her to impoſe vpon him all thoſe plagues ſhe had appointed the other thrée, and when hys perſwaſiue Oration was ſcarce done, hys eager minde that alreadie was working for ſo faire a rewarde, like the towring hawke, that ſwiftly takes the aduantage of the fearefull foule fares hee, that proud to himſelfe ſo faire a Saint ſhould ſo ſoone accept of his ſeruice, and imploy him in ſo ſerious a peece of ſeruice as was the remedy of her releaſe, flies with at ſpéed to effect hys purpoſe,

and ſhée poore ſoule hoping well that one of her workmen would at laſt returne againe with the reward of their worke, with comfort contents her ſelfe to abide the end: where wee muſt a while leaue her very melancholily meditating with her ſelfe, howe ſhée might beſt ſpende her time in that wicked Priſon, thinking euery houre to bee a whole yeare, and euery yeare a thouſand, till ſhee had heard againe ſome newes of her ſearching ſeruants, that had ſpred them ſelues all abroad in the wide world to ſéeke her ſome meanes for to mittigate her miſerie, and reſtore her to her former fréedome againe, and nowe a while follow our ſeuerall Aduenturers for her aide, that by this time had trauailed far from the place where they firſt tooke in hand this iournie.

                  TErpander the eldeſt brother, who firſt vndertooke this charge, iournying through the ſpacious plains of Aſia, hopeleſſe to finde: for that béeing long ſince, hee came to the ſide of the mountaine, where hée was promiſed to finde this viall of teares, and had almoſt ſought euerie ſeuerall corner of the ſame, and yet could finde no likelyhood of any ſuch matter: Notwithſtanding loath to leaue vnsought any place, where ſhewed any appearance of ſuch a matter. At laſt he ſaw a farre off the riſing as it were of an Alablaſter Rocke that halfe ouerſhadowed a hole, artificially cut into the ſide of the hill: whether hying him apace to see what there by might be meant, came at laſt to the place, and there at the firſt ſeacute;eing nothing that might any waies auaile him, was about to depart againe, till hearing ſomewhat haſting

ſaw this Lillie ſpring, & taking away the viall which he poore ſoule tooke to be no other than the teares of a virgin, that by ſuch kind of meanes as his ſiſter had diſcribed vnto him was placed there, and about to returne with ioyfull newes of his ſiſters deliuerance, hee had not gone farre from the place where firſt hee found it, ere the Viall beginning to warme with the heat of his hand, ſodainely by vertue of the venomous water therein incloſed, infuſed ſuch a contagious heate into euery ſeuerall vaine and ſinnow of his body, as that wherewith the poyſoned ſhirt was that inraged madding Hercules: So this poore man, that for his good meaning, was thus recompenſed with ill meaſure inraged with the extreame paine of his inuenomed limmes, gins fall into a frantike humor, leauing the way ſhould lead him backe againe to hys Siſter, and furiouſly without regard of himſelfe, gins reuenge hys iniurie vpon ſenſles and brutiſh beaſtes, that had now loſt all the power of a man.

To whom the mad man far vnlike himſelfe, (for that before he was courteous, but now contrarie to his kinde hee had changed his countenance to hair-braind crueltie and in ſtead of courteous behauiour, anſweres him in rayling opprobrious tearmes, and at the length begins with force to aſſaile him as an enemie; which Chinon perceiuing, cloſing with the mad man as hee came to incounter with him forceablie caſts him downe, & taking from him the Uiall of water, which all this while hee had kept cloſely in his handes, beginnes to looke what it ſhould be the poore ſoule had in ſuch requeſt, when ſuddenly by the like miſchance that the other was changed, himſelfe was with Lunacie preſently poſſeſſed: and raging like Aiax after his foyle for Vlyſſes hys armour, or mightie Al

Which the other perceiuing how hee was deliuered from that daunger, pittied the wofull eſtate of this worthie Man, but helpe him hee could not, for that ſuch was his inuincible ſtrength, now by the force of his furie much more augmented, which force neither man nor beaſt, ſtocke nor ſtone, nor any other creature whatſoeuer was able to ſtand in hys hand▪ ſo that in ſhort time, what with his vnorderly tracing through vnfrequented paſſages to finde fuell

for his fire, and his ſwift paces that ſtil ouer-went the other wearie wearie man, who had tyred himſelf before in his furie, Chinon was quite gone out of his ſight, whom wee muſt now leaue after the recouerye of his wits, trauelling home againe into hys owne Countrey, to ſéeke out ſome other meanes for the releaſe of his Siſter, and followe Chinon, who raging and rauing like an angrie Lion at laſt ouer-takes Micander, who (poore man as quiet for the ſorrow he had loſt the vſe of his tongue, as the other vnruly in his rage, ſéeing him a farre off, ſtaid ſtill to expect the euent of his ſudden epproach; when the madde man comming to him gins with vnſéemly behauior to abuſe the other poore diſtreſſed Soule, and wyth force pulling from him the Inſtrument which he was loth to looſe, though by it he had incurred ſuch a diſpleſure: yet at laſt Chinon (farre ſtronger than the other perforce pulls it away, and aſſaying with his fingers to ſtrike the ſtrings, was at the firſt ſound thereof ſtroken dumbe, whereof as ſoone as Chinon was poſſeſſed, Micander was ſtraight waye releaſed. Which infirmitie when Chinon perceaued in himſelfe, redoubling the rigour of his handes for the vſe hee had loſt of his tongue, gins furiouſly to fall vpon Michande

So in ſhort time ridding of himſelfe enough from the feare of this foe, hee for his owne ſafetie, takes home the neereſt waye hee could finde into hys owne Countrey.
            In the meane time Chynon wandring wyldly thus about the World all careleſſe where hee went, becauſe how ſoever hee turned, euerie where

lay his way, at laſt comes downe vnto the Sea ſide, where by chaunce he findes a Boate readie furniſhed with all prouiſion neceſſarie for the Sea; who (after the manner of ſuch madde men) leaping there intoo, (though ignorant what to do or careles whither to go, more than to ſatiſfie his mad humor) launched from ſhore, and making ſhift to ſet vp his ſaile, was quickly conueyed farre from the ſight of anie Land into the midſt of the merciles ſeas, ſayling too and fro manie dayes not fearing to be drownd, becauſe he perceiued nothing: nor expecting anie place whether to goe, for that he ſcarce knew, where he was either at ſea or on ſhore. But at the laſt (flying with his Barke before the Winde) he was ſuddenly driuen on ſhore vpon an Iland, where (leaping a land) he betooke himſelfe to trauaile vp into the countrie, to ſée what people it did affoord: where he had not long trauelled, but a farre off vpon the ſide of a Hil he eſpied one ſadly ſitting by himſelfe, towards whom he made what haſt he poſſibly could.
            This was the yongeſt Brother of thoſe thrée, that before we told ye of was ſtroken blind by looking into the inchanted Booke; to whom when he came, ſuddenly ſnatching the Booke out his hande (after hys fond furious faſhion) opens the claſpes to ſée what was therein contained, when ſuddenly iſſued out ſuch another fogge, as that wherewith Theonas was ſtriken blinde, and in like manner bedazels his eyes: when preſently Theonas was againe reſtored vnto his ſight, and wondring to ſee there ſo goodly a man poſſeſſed with ſo manie plagues at once, ginnes then with himſelfe conſider how it ſhould come to paſſe? who for that himſelfe was vnacquainted with what had happened to his other Bretheren, could geſſe at none but that which lately he was puniſhed wythall

himſelfe: one, for that the reaſonleſſe Man (for all theſe troubles wherewith hee was tormented) could not (by his meanes) be brought within the compaſſe of quiet behauiour, thought it beſt to prouide ſome meanes for his owne eſcape, and leaue hym there to the mercie of GOD, that would not be ruled by the meanes of a man; ſo he betooke himſelfe to his Journey, where wee muſt alſo leaue him (ridde by thys meanes of a miſchiefe) retourning to ſéeke hys Bretheren, and take ſome other order for their inchanted Siſter.
            The Inchauntreſſe now (that all this while ſawe the iſſue of this matter) gréeuing that her cunning ſhould be ſo croſſed, and yet ioying that all theſe puniſhments were light vppon his head, whom ſhe before feared more than all the reſt: ſet all her wits aworke, to deuiſe a meanes how ſhee might (now hauing him at ſuch a vantage) make him ſure for euer eſcaping out of her hands againe foreſéeing, that by his meanes all this ſcattered Kindred were likely to be reſtored againe to their former eſtate. And therefore (by her power) incloſes him within the clift of a Rocke, againſt which ſhe rouled vp a mightie ſtone, ſuch as the force of manie ordinarie men was not able to remooue: and ſo leaſt by any meanes he might be recouered out of this inchaunted Caſtle, ſhee places as Porter before the doore thereof a mightie Gyant, twice as great and grim as the ordinarie kynde of ſuch ouer-growen Creatures vſe to bée. Where, when hee was incloſed (ſuppoſing him now ſafe enough from anie reſort that ſhould bring him reléefe) ſhe was content all his plagues ſhould ceaſe, and hée (the more to aggreuate his griefe) be reſtored againe to his wits; which was effected as ſpeedily as determined.
            
               No ſooner was he cloſely ſhut vp into that vncomfortable Cabin, but all his Inſtruments (by whoſe meanes he came by thoſe croſſes) as his Water, his Harpe, and his Booke vaniſhed away, and he himſelfe reſtored (as I before ſaid) againe to the ſame eſtate of ſenſe as he was before, his libertie onely excepted: where we muſt now awhile leaue him in his melancholy Cell, and retourne againe into England. to ſée the ſorrow of olde Cador Duke of Cornwall, for the ſudden departure (without taking leaue) of Chinon his Sonne.

            Moſt royall Souereigne (for whom from my firſt able yeares may ſeruice hath béen imployed) vouchſafe me in my decayed yeares this Kingly comfort: Send foorth I beſéech you) ſome of his worthie fellow Knights to ſéeke Chinon my Sonne; who albeit he hath yet deſerved little either of your Grace or of them, yet his forward endeuour hath alway ſhowne he would much more ere this haue merited, had not enuious fortune croſt him in this ſort.
            To whom the King and all his Nobles preſent did moſt willingly condiſcend. Then calling together al the Knightly companie of his Round Table, declared to them Duke Cadors requeſt, and his owne readineſſe to haue it vndertaken: who all were not onely to goe in Queſt of Chinon, but each man manifeſted his more than common earneſtnes, by taking offence if anie one were named beſide himſelfe. To ende this controuerſie, the King thus prouided, that euerie man ſhould drawe his Lot, and on whom ſoeuer it fell, that Knight ſhould foorthwith chuſe hym two Fellowes from the reſt of the Companie, and ſo they thrée ſhuld take vpon them this deſired trauaile. The Lots accordingly were made, and euerie one of the Knights drew, and the Lot fell vpon Sir Calor, who was Sonne vnto Sir Lancelot du Lake and the beauteous Celeſtina Daughter to the King of France, whoſe Parents Chinon before valiantly reſcued, being betraid and taken in the hands of the trecherous Souldan.
            
               But before their departure, it was thought conuenient (for the better furtherance of their Journey) to take ſome counſell of Merlin, who then liued accounted as a Prophet in England, and by his ſkill I could tell of ſecrete things forepaſt, and hidden myſteries to come.
            
               Merlin beeing ſent for by the Kings commandement, came to the Court, and ſhewes them in a ſpeculatiue Glaſſe the manner of his departure out of England, the manie troubles hee had endured in hys Journey, and now at laſt opens at large the whole manner of that great miſerie whereuntoo he is now brought by the meanes of that ſubtill Inchauntreſſe: telling them further, that except they made verie excéeding great ſpéed for to procure his releaſe, hee was likely to dye there for want of reléefe, being there detained from all neceſſaries fit to ſuſtaine a man; or at leaſt hauing of thoſe neceſſaries a verie ſhort pittance allowed him.
            
               Merlin haſtening them forward on their iourney, promiſed al the cunning he could affoord for their ſpéedie conueyance, which he effectually perfourmed, ſo that in ſhort time they were arriued in this perillous Iland: where after long ſearch for the place wherein Merlin did promiſe they ſhould finde their friend, at laſt they might eſpie this monſtrous man, iaylour to that unfortunate Knight, ſtretching himſelfe at the mouth of the Caue wherein in Chinon was kept. To him they made all poſſible ſpéede, and firſt of all Syr Calor addreſſing himſelfe to fight, gins before hee offered violence with curteous gréetings to ſalute hym gently, demaunding what he was that liued ſo deſolately in that vnfrequented Iland? To whom the deteſted and curriſh Carle made this vnmannerly aunſwere.
            
               I am quoth hee as thou ſéeſt, one within whoſe clawes thou and the reſt of thy ſawcie companions haue compaſſed your ſelues: if therefore you will ſubmit your ſelues to my mercy, then will I thus diſpoſe of you héere within a hollow Caue hewne out of this craggie Rock, wherein lyes incloſed a knight ſuch a one as you are, who for the like offence that you now haue offered, is condemned to the eternall ſlauerie of perpetuall impriſonment, within ſhall you ſpend your hatefull liues, and when for hunger you are welnie ſtarued, fall freſhly then to eate one anothers fleſh, but if you ſtubbornely ſtand out againſt mee, thus will I diſpoyle you in renting your curſed limmes péece meale a ſunder, or els faſtning you ſeuerall to the big bulks of ſome of theſe trées: where when the imperiall puniſhment of haſtning hunger ſhall ſeaze vpon your ſelues, you ſhall there be inforced to eate your owne fleſh that might here haue fed vpon another, to whome Syr Calor thus anſwered.
            Foule vglie fiend, wee come not to knéele to thée, but to force thy ſubiection to vs and for the releaſe of a Chriſtian Knight thay thou kéepeſt Captiue within thy power.
            At which wordes the Giant ſéeing them addreſſe themſelues to fight, preſently be ſtirs himſelfe, and taking an Iron mace, (which to that ende the Witch had prouided) lets driue at Sir Calor with all the might he could, from which he nimbly leaping away eſchued the force of the fall, whē as the other Knights comming in to reſcue ſir Calor, before the Giant could againe get vp his weapon from the grounde, they had ſo mangled hys limmes, as he was now far vnable to fight, but falling proſtrate downe before them, humblie intreats for his life: which they were willing to graunt, as not ſéeking the loſſe of him, but

the life of their friend, to whome the Giant gins relate all the manner of the impriſonment of Chinon, and at the laſt opens the doore of the Caue, and calles him out to his friends, who reſaluting one another with ſuch friendly gréetings as are vſuall at ſuch aduenturos accidents, take their iournie from thence vp into the Countrie, and for that the Giant had told

                them in hys former diſcouſe of the manner of Chinons impriſonment, how that Peroſus for whoſe loue all this had come about, had in Egipt taken Armes againſt the King, for that his treaſon béeing diſcouered, he intended to recal old Beſſarian from his baniſhment, and that his power ſo daylie increaſed, as that it was now far greater than the Kings, they intended to ſhape their iournie thetherwards and help the king in his warres againſt this traiterous rebbell: where wee muſt let them goe forward a while in their iourny, and returne againe to our thrée aduenturers for their ſiſters libertie.

               How Beſſarians ſonnes met with their Father in the ſhape of a Beare.
            
            
               AFter that theſe thrée yong men were againe reſtored to their former eſtate, Terpander the firſt of them trauailing homewards to ſéeke againe his ſiſter, méetes by the way his tranſformed Father, who not a little glad to ſee his ſonne, though the other taking him for no leſſe than he ſéemed, made ſome haſt to fly from him, till looking backe and perceauing the ſcroule about his necke for the regaining of his harts deſire, ſtrikes his poore father with ſuch a blow, as breaking his ſword vpon the ſcalpe of his head, he was forced to flie for want of weapons, fearing leaſt the Beare ſhould haue fallen freſhly vppon him, béeing tyred when as God knowes the ſillie man aſtoniſhed with the ſtroke, was rather afraid of an vnnaturall deaths wound by his ſonne, then willing to proſecute any reuenge for the ſame.
            Not long after Terpander had thus hurt his Father, comes that way the ſecond brother, who in like caſe méeting with the Beare and hoping by his death to obtaine his deſire, gins with a Boreſpeare hee had in his hand eagerly to aſſayle him, in ſo much ſhal in

ſhort time hee had grieuouſly wounded hym, but the head of his weapon by chance breaking off, hee was forced to flie as did his brother: to be ſhort the Witch that intended by the meanes of ſome of theſe ſonnes, to make away their father. After that the firſt two had fayled, brought thether the third, who eager to accompliſh his deſire, promiſed by the ſcroule that hung about hys fathers necke, begins a freſh fight, & ſo wounded his ſillie ſire, as that for want of blood which hys weapon had lauiſhly lanched out, hee was forced to fall downe, whome Theonas ſuppoſing to be dead, left there to follow his deſire.
            In the meane time whileſt theſe thinges were thus in dooing had there béene ſought a great battaile in Egipt, betwixt Egbaton their King, and Peroſus the traitour, of whome before we told you: where by the meanes of the Engliſhmen the King ouercame, and Peroſus was put to flight: who for his ſauegard forſaking hys Countrie, betooke himſelfe to the Mountaines: where after hee had long traueiled, hee by chance met with Beſſarian tranſformed, as afore wee haue t

            At which Peroſus béeing afraid ſéeing himſelfe aſſailed, gins make all the meanes hee could for hys eſcape: but the other loath to requite him euill for hys ill dealing, in ſtéede of ſuch rauinous behauiour, as comnonly is found in ſuch like beaſts, gently fawnes vpon him, ſhewing himſelfe rather willing to helpe him, than readie to hurt him.
            When Peroſus calling to mind hys former offence in the bewitching of the old man, and ſéeing by the writing about his necke, that this was he whome hée

               miſſiue teares intreats his pardon: to whome the Beare though vnable to ſpeake, yet with dumbe demeans ſhewing the effect of his minde, anſwers in dum tokens what he could not tel in plauſible words: to whom Peroſus there promiſed, that would hee but follow him, hee would foorthwith conduct hym to the place where hys daughter was impriſoned, & where he hoped alſo to méet with her, by whoſe meanes all this was brought to paſſe.
            In the meane time Chinon and his fellow knights following their foes from the fight, by chaunce intercepted Eutropa the Witch as ſhée was flying awaie, whome preſently they intending to kill, & ſhee knowing very well their crueltie, fell downe before them, humbly aſking pardon for her life, and in requitall thereof ſhée would reſtore to liberty, her for whoſe ſake Chinon had ſuffered all this extreamity, than which Chinon deſiring nothing more graunts her requeſts, whome ſhée preſently tranſportes to the place where Caſſiopea lay impriſoned: where when they came, they found her thrée brethren dilating vnto her theyr ſeuerall ill luckes, whome as ſoone as they came, the Witch releaſed from the bondage of the Rocke, and falling downe on her knées aſkes hartie pardon for her amis, to whome the Lady glad of her releaſe ſtraight forgiues that offence, and then Eutropa telling her the great perrill Chinon had ouerpaſſed for her loue: ſhée with all curteſie falles downe at hys ſeéeke, ſubmitting her ſelfe for requitall thereof to be diſpoſed at hys pleaſure, whom he taking vp from the ground, offering himſelfe likewiſe to her.
