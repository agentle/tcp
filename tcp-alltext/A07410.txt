            ¶IOHN BROOKE VNto the Chriſtian Reader.
            
               AMong all the things that are to be ſeene vnder the heauens (good Chriſtian Reader) there is nothing can ſtirre vp the minde of man, & which can engender more fere vnto the creatures then the horrible Monſters, which are brought forth dayly contrary vnto the workes of Nature. The which the moſt times doe note and demonſtrate vnto vs the Ire and wrath of God, againſt vs for our ſinnes and wickedneſſe, that we haue and doe dayly commit agaynſt him. But mans heart is ſo hardened that thoſe his threatnings and foreſhewings are reiected as though they were but fables. Therefore many times the Elements haue bene and be the heraulds and executors of Gods Iuſtice, as we do read in the viij. chapter of Geneſis,Geneſ, 8 that the waters ouerflowed the toppe of the higheſt mountaine. xv. cubites, and drowned all the worlde except viij. perſons. The fire in lyke manner as we do read in the xix. chapter of Geneſis conſumed & burnedGeneſ. 19 the Citie of Sodoma and Gomorra. Alſo the earth as we may read in the xvi. chap. of Numeri opened hir mouthNum. 16 and ſwallowed vp Chorah, Dathan, and Abiron. Beſides an infinite number of examples more, which are to bee ſeene in the holy Scripture, and all was done for the wickedneſſe & ſinnes of the people. Therefore the rather to moue the harts of euery good chriſtian to feare & tremble at the ſight of ſuch prodigious monſters, I haue taken vpon me to tranſlate out of French into our Engliſh tongue theſe two monſters, the one of a Popiſh Aſle which was found at Rome in the yeare of our Lord. 1496. And the other of a Moonkiſh Calfe, calued at Friberge in the yeare 1528.
            
               And the willinglyer for that Philip Melancthon & Martyn Luther two godly and learned men, haue interpreted vpon theſe two Monſters, who were of ſuch authoritie and credit, that we muſt not thinke that they be forged and inuented. Signifiyng that theſe two Monſters may well be compared vnto the Pope and his rablement of Cardinals, Abbottes, Biſhops, Prieſts, Canons, Moonks and Fryers, as Gods meſſengers, to giue warning vnto them that Gods wrath is redy at hād to deſtroy both him & his kingdome, with his whole rable of Cardinals, Moonks & ſhauelings, diſguiſing thēſelues ſo againſt nature, as theſe two Mōſters were. For Sathā is a wyly Fox ſeeking all the meanes poſsible thorow his ſubtile practiſes, to ſeduce and keepe ſtill in ignoraunce & error, all Chriſtendome. Therefore let vs way diligently theſe his wonderous woorkes, and repent in time from the bottome of our hearts of our ſinnes, and deſire him to be mercifull vnto vs, & euer to kepe & defend vs from ſuch horrible Monſters.
            AMEN.

               THere hath now bene a long time ſithēceGod doth aduertiſe men of their impieties diuerſly. God hath not ceaſed to teach & giue aduertiſmēts after diuerſe ſorts & faſhions, to draw men frō their impieties & deteſtable conuerſations, & yet neuertheleſſe the ingratitude of the worlde is ſo great, that nothing followeth but a hardning of heart more then obſtinate. The Lord threatneth, & his threatnings are reiected as if they wer but fables. He ſetteth foorth monſtrous and feareful figures,The vngratfull men deſpiſe the meruailes of God. which were inough to make the Diuels themſelues afraide: And men doe ſee them and let them paſſe, as if they touched them nothing at all. Furthermore, he declareth effectually that he threatneth not in vaine. He declareth by terrible iudgements, that he cannot ſuffer the contempt of his aduertiſments: Howbeit, men haue their ſences altogether dull in regard of that: And of a thouſand, ſcātly ther are twaine which will open their eyes to conſider and beholde the wonders of the Lord, and to amende their lyues therby. Beholde two monſtrous figures which are ſet before vs: And the two moſt excelent men, to wit, Philip Melancthon and Martin Luther, who haue interpreted them, are of ſufficient authoritie to make men to vnderſtand, that thoſe monſters are not forged and inuented fantaſies. The firſt is a general witneſſe of the horrible vengeaunce of God ouer eueryThe ſignificatiō of the firſt Monſter. kingdome that exalteth it ſelf by cruelty & tyranny aboue the ſpirituall iuriſdiction of the ſon of God. And bicauſe that this tyranny is more liuely ſet forth by the dominatiō of the Pope, thē by any other, euen ſo this threatning is referred chiefely vnto that Romiſh

The ingratitude of men haue well deſerued to fall into that brutiſhneſſe: They ſee the belly of a whoore naked, & yet neuertheleſſe this is their owne God, whom they feare and worſhip, and vnto whom they doe homage, with their kings, Lords, and Emperours. Now for as much as the Moonkes are the principall proppes of that drunken and enchaunting harlot,The figure of the ſecond Monſter. very fitte is happened this other monſter, in the likeneſſe of a Monkiſh Calfe, hauing on him a coole, who will playe his part as well as the Popiſh Aſſe.

And if in taking away the coole or frocke, the Calfe remaineth but a Calfe, what ſhall the Moonke remaine, when his frocke & coole ſhalbe taken from him, but that he is a Moonke for euery mans porredge pot? But this it is, ſo long as the Diuell ſhall be Prince of the world, the world ſhal haue alwaies their eyes blinded. But as for vs we doe feare ſuch aduertiſementes of God, let vs conſider diligently his wondrous woorkes, and preuent the effectes of his iudgementes thorow true repentaunce.

            Firſt of all, the heade of the Aſſe is a deſcriptionThe head of the Aſſe. The Church is a ſpiritual body and kingdome. of the Pope▪ For the Churche is a ſpirituall bodye and kingdome, aſſembled together in ſpirite. And therefore it cannot nor ought not to haue a mannes head, nor a viſible Lorde. But onely the LORD IESUS, which formeth the heartes inwardlye, by the holy Ghoſt by fayth, kéepeth, reneweth, and gouerneth them as Lorde and head. Contrary vnto theſe thinges the Pope hath made himſelfe the viſible and outwarde heade of the Churche: And for that cauſe the Pope is ſignified by the heade of this Aſſe, ioyned with a mannes bodye. For as it is not ſéemely that a mannes bodye ſhoulde haue an Aſſes heade: euen ſo is it altogether vnſmelye that the Pope of Rome ſhoulde bée the heade of the Church.
            For the holy Scriptures doe vnderſtande by theVVhat ye Aſſe doth ſignifie in the holy Scripturt. Aſſe, the externall and carnall lyfe, and the Elementes

of the worlde: As in the thirtéenth Chapter of Exodus. And as much difference as there is betwéene the brayne of an Aſſe and the reaſon and witte of a man, ſo muche difference there is betwéene the doctrine and ordinaunces of the Pope, and the Doctrine and inſtruction of the ſonne of God.
            For in the Popes kingdome there is nothinge but mannes traditions and ordinaunces whiche beare authoritie▪ by the which hée hath enlarged his lymittes and boudes, and hath exalted himſelfe in dignitie: Theſe are the rockes vppon whiche hée is builded. But as ſoone as he ſhould heare the woord of Ieſus Chriſt to ſounde, and that hée ſhoulde ſuffer that

            But although it bée not compared to the woorde of God and the holy Scriptures, but onely to the naturall equitie and lyght of mans reaſon: wée ſhall finde that his brayne is the brayne of an Aſſe.
            The whiche the Canoniſtes themſelues doe wytneſſe, ſettinge foorth this matter, that a méere CanoniſtA Canoniſt is an Aſſe. is a very Aſſe and a beaſt. Their bookes doe confirme the ſame ſo cléerely and playnelye, that hée which ſhall knowe them, will not aſke, what is hée whome they call Aſſe. For a Canoniſt is hée which hath ſtudyed in decrées, or in the right Canon, the Popes Scholler, hauing the Pope for his Schoolemaſter.
            Secondly, the right hande lyke vnto the foote ofThe right hand an Elephaunt, ſignifieth the ſpirituall gouernement of the Pope, by the which hée amazeth and feareth all the weake and fearefull conſciences And

According to that which is ſayde in Daniel, Chapt, viij.Daniel.

Timot. 4. a. 3. their owne luſtes ſhall they (whoſe eares itch) get them an heape of teachers, and ſhall tourne their eares from the truth, and ſhall bée giuen vnto fables.

both exerciſe héere a pernicious, vniuſt, and cruell domination.
            Thirdly, the left hand which is the hand of a man,The left hand the hand of a man. ſignifieth the ciuile power of ye pope. The ſonne of god hath manifeſtly forbidden that power or domination to the Prelates of the Church. Luc. 22 chap. ſaying:Luc. 22. b. 2

                The kings of the Gentiles reigne ouer them, & they that beare rule ouer them, are called gratious Lords. But ye ſhall not be ſo.
            Neuertheleſſe the Pope, through ſo many deceits, engines, crafts and enchauntments, is mounted vnto ſo high power and authoritie through the inſtigation of the diuell, that his ciuill Iuriſdiction is no leſſe then the moſt purſſant King that one can finde. But he hath more, he gouerneth and hath vnder his féete all worldly Kingdomes and Empires, as ſouereigne Lorde ofAll kingdomes and empires are vnder y• Popes feete, Kinges and Princes, whome hée hath ioyned to him for to amplyfie, beautifie, confirme and mainteine his barbarous and cruell power and authoritie. And that is to the ende that the Prophecie of the eyght chapter of Daniell bée fulfilled, ſaying: Hée ſhall bée mightieDaniel. 8. g. 24 and ſtrong, but not in his owne ſtrengh.
            Finally he is aſcended to ſuch dignitie, puffed vp with ſuch pride, fine with ſuch pompe & magnificence, that neuer one heard ſpeake of the lyke thing. There was neuer king or Emperour which hath made ſo many warres and which hath ſhed ſo much bloud. And in ſtéede that he ought to haue regard to the dignitie of the word of God, to maynteine, conſerue and kéepe the commodities and goods of the Church, according as his vocation & office doe require, he deſireth the chiefe and principal dominations of the world, he hath learned to make very braue and gorgeous apparaile, and to enflame and kindle warres. And giuing himſelfe vnto all thoſe goodly thinges, hée treadeth vnder foote,

the doctrine, he forſaketh the Church, he ſuffereth that all the holy things be ſet for a pray, that the prophane and temporall things be ſpoyled, that all be defaced and turned vpſide downe.
            Wherefore behold what the hande of man ſignifieth:The Popish kingdome eſtablished through mans vviſedom For that kingdome hath bene eſtablyſhed onely through the wiſedomes, opinions, and councells of men, without authoritie of the holy ſcriptures: when they ſay that it is a reaſonable thing, that the heire of the Apoſtolycall ſeate and the Vicar of Ieſus Chriſt, be not ſubiect vnto any man. But thankes be vnto our good God, the matter is come vnto this poynt, that many of the common people, and others alſo of al eſtates, doe vnderſtande cleerely and playnely inough, the goodly ſhewes of ſo many execrable wickedneſſes, of which all that Popiſh vermine hath ſhamed themſelues, and hath defamed the renowne of the Chriſtians.
            Fourthly, the right foote lyke vnto an Oxe foote,The right fo
                     •
                  t ſignifieth the Miniſters of the ſpirituall gouernment, and as a man may ſay, the Porters, who in oppreſſing the poore ſoules, doe vpholde and mayneteine the Popes kingdome. Theſe are the Doctours in Decrées, the Doctours made by the PopesThoſe vvhich doe vphold the Popes kingdom Bulles, Dataires, Preachers of Pardons, Maſſe Prieſts, Confeſſors aſwell of Moonkes as Nunnes: and the chiefeſt of all this vermine, are the ſcholaſticall diuines.
            For what doth all that deteſtable filthie company, but to put into the headde, and to print into the heart of the people thoſe ordinaunces of the Pope, which are ſo harde and not to bee borne? And to ſette them foorth in all their Sermons, in all their doctrine, in their confeſſions: That thereby they may holde the poore conſciences captiue vnder

the foote of the Elephant, the which were already too much afflicted and grieued? All thoſe raſcalls are as the foote, the foundation and piller of the Popes kingdome, the which coulde neuer ſo long time haue continued, without the buylding that thoſe héere with the reſt of their complices and adherents, haue buylded vppon.
            I pray you what doth the Scholaſticall diuinitieScholaſticall diuinitie. conteine, but vayne, fonde, execrable, and diabolycall dreames, and the monſtrous dreames of Moonkes, by which they doe enchaunt, treade vnder foote, keepe vnder, and caſt downe headlong the poore troubled ſoules of the afflicted Chriſtians.

For a ſimple Bull of the Pope, was more terrible and feareful then the Iudgement of almightie GOD, thundering out his commaundements and threatenings.
            Fifthly, the lefte foote lyke vnto the foote of a Griphin,The left foote of a Griphin. ſignifieth the Miniſters of the ciuile or ſecular power: That is to ſay the Canoniſts, the Chauncelours and the raſcalls making profeſſion of the Canon lawe, which of their owne accorde doe acknowledge and confeſſe, that the moſt holy Canons or Decretals, doe ſmell their moſt abhominable auarice and ambition.
            For euen as the Griphins doe not eaſely let goe that that they haue once caught or layde holde on: Euen ſo theſe maynteiners and raueners of the Pope,

doe holde faſt all that which they can get, and let not lyghtly goe the pray: and as through the hookes of the Canons they haue entrapped almoſt all the goods of al Europe: and they holde them ſo faſt, that one cannot pull them out of their clawes, for the Canons do ſerue to their inſatiable auarice. This deadly Harpy hath deuoured all the world: ſhe hath taken away all the goods: ſhe hath endamaged the ſoules and bodyes; ſhe hath ſtollen vnto hir all honours.
            Sixtiy, the belly and the ſtomacke, the which do reſembleThe belly and the ſtomacke of a woman the belly and ſtomacke of a woeman, ſignifie the body of the Pope: That is to ſay the Cardinals, Archbiſhops, Biſhops, Abbots, Moonkes, Prieſts, and other execrable ſpirituall Martirs, and all the reſt of his bawdes, and fatte hogges, which haue none other care all their lyfe time but to féede and pamper their paunches with delycious wynes and delycate diſhes: to ſéeke their eaſe and all the allurements and entiſements to whoredome, & to kéepe themſelues in al pleaſures and Idleneſſe, and to giue themſelues vnto all monſtrous infamies. The which they may very well doe, and fréely: For they haue many priuiledges, wherewith they are wel armed and munited for to be exempted from all puniſhment. As we doe ſée this Popiſh Aſſe who ſheweth before all mens eyes openly,VVhat it is to she

            For at this daye in our time, there is no power which is lyke or more greater in the Citie of Rome, then that of the Pope. For GOD hath alwayes declared by meruaylous ſignes and tokens in thoſe places which thoſe ſignes doe ſignifie and betoken ſome thing, as it happened in Hieruſulem, and for that that this Monſter was founde dead, that is an argument that the ende of the Popes kingdome draweth on faſt.
            And wée muſt haue neyther ſworde nor any ſtrength of man for to put it downe: But the heauenly vertue, ſhall cauſe that of himſelfe it ſhall bée ouerthrowen. For this prodigious Monſter was not killed by any counſell or meanes of men: But was founde dead, and was reuealed by the ſingular prouidence of God.

But we for our parts lette vs reioyce and take comfort, & let vs put this ſigne in the number of thoſe who do declare vnto vs y• day ſo long deſired, ſo healthfull, ſo goodly, the comming of our Lord and redéemer Ieſus Chriſt.

And let vs behold whether the troubles that they haue heaped vp more and more, ſhall be to moleſt and grieue God or themſelues. Neuertheleſſe I am not much angry with-them, foraſmuch as they are ſo deſperately madde, and that they doe ſo trouble the heauen with the earth.
            O good God, if I were ſo paynted foorth at Gods hande, with a figure and ſhape ſo odious and terrible, I could in no manner abide and ſuffer it. For eyther I ſhould dye for very feare, except that I had an heart of yron or ſtéele, as they haue: Or els I ſhould burſt and cleane a ſunder, with deſpite, choler and madneſſe. What is he then that goeth about, eyther by counſell or by commaundement, to obtayne of them, that they would pardon the Lorde Ieſus one ſuch contumely and wrong which is done vnto them by ſuch an Image or figure.

            ¶ THE APPROBATION of Martyn Luther.
            
               THis Popiſh Aſſe is of himſelfe a monſtrous figure, fearefull & horrible, and the more that one doth behold him, the more terrible he appeareth. But behold which is the moſt terribleſt of all, that God himſelfe hath formed and reuealed this monſter, as a figure full of fearefulneſſe. For if any workeman had drawen it, painted or engraued it, one might well mock of it, and not to paſſe on it. But bicauſe that the holy diuine maieſtie hath formed and made it and that he hath ſet before vs ſuch a figure, it behoueth all men to tremble▪ when and as often as the ſame doth come in their remembraunce: and that they be eſtonned & amazed, as of a thing of which one may eaſily coniecture of the thought, counſell and will of God.
            Is there any man in the world which would not be afraide, if he ſhould ſee a wicked ſpirite, or a phancie, or if he doe heare any ſodeine bruite or noiſe, or any groningGod doth shewe himſelfe irreconcilable vnder ye figure of the Popish Aſſe. or lamentation of ſpirites. Yet notwithſtanding one ought not to eſtéeme the ſame but as a falſe viſage or a play of little children, in compariſon of this Image and monſtrous figure. In which god himſelfe appeared in a terrible forme, ſhewing an vnappeaſable ſeueritie. Wee muſt neceſſaryly ſay, that there is a terrible indignation of God kindled againſt that Idoll of Antechriſt, the which all that company and raſcalls of the Pope, doe ſtirre vp and prouoke as of a ſet purpoſe and of an hard froward ſtubburneneſſe: & the beginings doe agrée ſo well and ſo fitly, that one can in no wiſe doubt.
            For as much then as Sodome had of ſo long time

and through ſo execrable miſdéedes prouoked Gods wrath: and as the ruine béeinge nigh at hande, there reſted but a little time to repent them: then ſhée dyd giue hir ſelfe fréely vnto all execrable wickedneſſe, and hardned hir ſelfe with ſuch obſtinacy, that ſhe did plainly mocke God, and did exalt hir ſelfe againſt him with an intollerable fierceneſſe and cruelneſſe. But ſcantly the heauen had giuen hir cléereneſſe the next day morning, but beholde it was ſodeinly ſwallowed vp & conſumed. We muſt not doubt, but that all that band of the Pope doth ſpinne all one thréed. They haue hetherto let

And although that before the time of their fall & ruine they are exhorted by ſo many ſtraunge figures and fearefull ſignes ſent of GOD, for to call them to repentaunce: yet neuertheleſſe they are the more obſtinate and out of all order: in ſuch ſorte that they doe heape vp, nouriſh and augement more and more, a proude, negligence and arrogant profanations: In ſo much that with muche adooe they themſelues can ſuffer their raſhneſſe, boldeneſſe and wickedneſſe.

               AS touching the Propheticall interpretacion of this Moonkiſh Calfe, I will leaue it to the ſpirit: for I am no prophet. Yet neuertheles one may well affirme this generally of many ſuch meruayles, that God doth ſend them as preſages and forewarnings of ſorrowfull aduentures, motions, brutes, troubles and commotions to come. And I doe exhort Germany to aſſure themſelues boldly and to attende certeinely ſuch commings. But to determine of chaunces and to foreſhew how long time they ſhall continue, or in what ti

            As for me, I will deſire willingly that the latter day were at hande: the which I alſo doe thinke, that the dayes wherein we are, are as forerunners of that bleſſed day, the which will not tary long after. And me thinketh that the cauſe that I haue to hope ſo, is not friuolous nor vaine. And in very déede, before time ther hath ben almoſt a continuation of certeine worlds, in which men haue ſéene dayly monſtrous things, and worthy of great admiration: And at this day all the worlde burning with a terrible heat, bringeth forth motions very pernicious, who commonly are not appeaſed without great chaunges & alterations of kingdoms. To conclude, that the lyght of the Goſpell, ſhineth

now wonderfully, the which commonly was wont to bring with it alterations, troubles and tempeſts, bicauſe of the hard obſtination, and furious ragings of the wicked.
            And truly I will not ſpeake but of things which are true: and will ſhew wherefore God hath ſet foorth ſuch a ſigne in that Moonkiſh Calfe, and for what cauſe hée hath defiled the religious habite or apparayle with one ſo vyle a ſpotte: Foraſmuch as without the habite of a Moonke hée might ſignifie and declare the euills to come as properly and well by any other ſhew or token. Euen ſo then it is not long ſithence that by his prouidence was calued at Langdesberge a certeine Canon Calfe, or a Moonkiſh Calfe. It declareth thereby, that all religious men and Moonkes ought to haue their eyes thereon ſtill fixed, and that he beholdeth them, and that he hath determined to puniſh them: For this ſame yeare he will vſe none other miracles, then thoſe which haue reſpecte vnto ſuch holy and ſpirituall people.

And all that that they haue conceiued in their minde how high and harde that it be, they hope to bring it to paſſe, and to atteine vnto it through good councells, through great viua

            In lyke manner in this figure of this Moonkiſh Calfe, beſides the Propheticall declaration, there is alſo an Image or figure of the lyfe, of the doctrine of the ſeruices and obſeruations of the Moonkes: And it is poſſible that thereby there is an aduertiſement of the

cauſe of the calamities nighe at hande. That is to ſaye, that the ſuperſtitions, the deceites and wickedneſſe of the Moonkes, doe cauſe the puniſhment to increaſe, for as much as by the Phariſaycall doctrine of woorkes, they doe aboliſh the fayth which is in our Lorde Ieſus Chriſt, and doe tranſforme and chaunge into the fleſh of a Calfe mans heart, which ought to bée the Temple of the holy Ghoſt. Furthermore, let an other drawe the propheticall ſence: as for mée for to pleaſe my order, I haue taken vpon me to interpret my Moonkiſh Calfe: The Canon Calfe ſhall haue an other for his expoſiter.
            For ſo much the more willingly doe I take the charge to make this declaration, for that I doe ſée that the obſtinate courages and more harder then the rockes, of thoſe which ſhall bée grieued with this my explication, ſhall bée ſo much the more wounded and ſhall bée come more eger. As in very déede they doe arrogantlye deſpiſe all that whiche commeth out of my mouth, and doe babble euery where, that all my woordes are as much to bée eſtéemed as the ſpittinges of heretickes. For that cauſe they ought not alſo nowThe interpretation made for to harden the heartes of thoſe vvhich do giue no credit vnto the aduertiſmēts of the faithfull.

neuertheleſſe hée could not amende it: ſo one may ſay the lyke of thoſe holy Fathers, which haue hetherto ſtopped their eares at the cléere voyce of the veritie of the Goſpell. Nowe they ought to beholde themſelues in this Calfe and in the Cowe, as in a glaſſe, and to conſider what they are before God, and what reputation and what voice they haue in heauen. And yet neuertheleſſe they ought to ſhut their eyes that they doe ſée nothing of all this, whereoff they may repent themſelues, for to auoid the horrible iudgement of God. For there is neither forewarning, word nor ſigne that couldThe hearts hardened after the example of Pharao. moue or bend the hard heart of Pharao.
            
            Firſt, that I may ſpeak briefly, thinke not, that the ſame is a mockery or a fable, that God hath clothed a Calfe with a religious habite, & with a Moonkes coole. Wée muſt not doubt, but that he noteth by that Image or figure, a certeine aſſemble of people, of whiche one may cléerely knowe, that the Moonkery is nothing elsThe Moonkery is but a vaine appearaunce. but a vaine appearaunce and ſhewe of godlyneſſe, and outward hipocriſie of a holy lyfe allowed of God. For euen vntil this times we poore and miſerable men haue had this opinion and haue beléeued, that the holy Ghoſt dwelleth vnder the frocke, and that the ſame habit doth couer nothing but the holy Ghoſt.
            But God hath reuealed héere, that there is nothing vnder that habite but a Calfe. As if he would ſhewe that there is a Serpent hid vnder the graſſe. For the golden calfe of Aaron, lifted vp in the wilderneſſe, vntoThe golden Calfe of Aaron whom the children of Iſrael did repreſent & giue the honour that apperteined and belonged vnto God, Exodus

againſt whome the Prophets haue cryed very ſharply. In lyke manner let vs beholde a little that ſame Moonkiſh Calfe, howe that his coole doth repreſent there a figure of all the order of Moonkes, with al their ſeruices and diuine obſeruatiōs, of which they do make ſo great accompt: as of their Pater noſter, ſo oftentimes repeted, of ye faire of their Maſſes, of their goodly ſongs, and faſtings, and other lyke.
            But vnto whom is that goodly ſeruice repreſented? who is honoured? of whome doth it depende? vnto whom is it tyed and faſtened? vnto the Calfe. For the Calfe is clothed with a frock, as we may ſée heere. And what is that Calfe? It is an Idoll forged andThe Calfe is an Idoll forged in the ſpirites of Moonkes. made, abiding and dwelling in their ſpirites full of deceites. What is that that theſe things doo? They do after this ſorte. Theſe holy Maſters haue an opinion imprinted in their vnderſtanding, that in their Moonkiſh and ſolitary religion, they doe ſerue and render obedienceThe religion of the Moonkes builded vpon ceremonies and outvvard works vnto the true God, the whiche religion they haue conſtituted in Ceremonies & obſeruations of certeine outward woorkes, by which they doe thinke that they haue well deſerued heauen: and not in the certeinty & truſt which embraceth the benefit of Ieſus Chriſt.
            For it is euen thus, that there is no God, either in heauē or earth which would be ſo ſerued & worſhipped but y• diuel & the Idols.

The Calfe doth not liue but of hearbes and graſſe. For ſuch hipocrites haue no knowledge of the eternall goodneſſe, but doe fat themſelues with the pleaſures of this preſent lyfe: As one may playnly ſée that the moſt puiſſanteſt and ample riches,VVhat it is to be nourished & ſed vvith graſſe and the moſt greateſt pleaſures, and the moſt higheſt dignities and honours are belonging vnto the people of the Church, as one calleth them. And euen ſo theſe Calues haue found graſſe for their owne tooth. And this is happened vnto them, that they haue turnedPſa. 106. c. 10 their glory into the ſimilitude of a Calfe that eateth Haye. For Chriſt is our true glory, in whom wée muſt triumph, glory, and reioyce. Theſe héere cleane contrarye, doe ſéeke an other glorye in their heartes, and doe aduaunce and bragge themſelues verye proudly of the truſt of their merites and woorkes. Such a Calfe is come in the ſtéed of Ieſus Chriſt, & in vſurping the name of him, he doth blaſpheme and diſhonour it.

            But theſe madde braynes, ſuperſticious and too holy Moonkes knew very well to forge, inuent & finde out ſo many differences of ſectes and opinions, as there is of diuers apparayle among them.

So we ſeing that the frocke is rent and torne about the thighes and féete of that Calfe: Although that all were of one will and did agrée well, aſmuch as concerneth the apparell of the Calfe: that is to ſay, although that all did nouriſh that obſtinate opinion in their hearts: to wit that they did doubt or diſtruſt of the mercie of God: and on the contrary did leane and ſtay vppon the affiaunce and carnall aſſurance of their woorkes, according to their obſeruations.

            Thirdly, this Calfe repreſenteth the geſture and countenaunce of a Preacher. For he ſtandeth vpright vppon his hinder féete: and of the two fore féete, he caſteth the right after the manner of a Preacher, and holdeth backe the lefte, hée hath his heade lyfted vp: he putteth out his tongue: there is nothing in him, which doth not repreſent thoſe greate Cryers in the fleſh.

            For can any man finde an Apoſtle more fit for the braine of an Aſſe, then the head of a Calfe? This is a fit couer for the pot.
            The carnall gouernment hath alwayes a carnall doctrine. And therefore the Calfe is yet without eyes, or blinde, for to figure thoſe of whome Ieſus Chriſt

ſpeaketh off in Saint Mathew the 23. chapter, ſaying.Mat. 23. b.

it foolyſhly vnto the traditions of men. So then from the crowne of the head, which is ſhauen, doe appeare two lyttle knobbes lyke vnto peaſe. For vnder the

            And for that the Coole is ſo faſt behinde theThe Moonkes coole or hood tyed to ye neck. necke, the ſame declareth the incredible obſtination of the ſuperſticion and of the errours of theſe doltiſhe Moonkes, concerning the obſeruations and Monaſticall ceremonyes.

            Now for that the Coole was tyed and cloſe behindeThe Moonkes do keepe and hold faſt the hood & forſake & let go tranſitory goods at the backe, and that towards the belly or before it appeared to be open or vnſewed, doth ſignifie yt thoſe doe ſhew in their outward apparayle a certeine godlyneſſe: and it is vnder the coulour that they doe forſake and renounce all tranſitory goodes. But if they muſt come vnto God, or if one would bring them to the eternall lyfe, one ſhal finde that thoſe are naked bellyes, and vnprofitable burthens for to conſume the goods of ye earth, yea committing all enormities: of which I loue rather to holde my peace.
            And whereas that the Iawes below are lyke vnto the Iawes of a man, and thoſe aboue with the noſtrels lyke vnto thoſe of a Calfe, the ſame ſignifieth that in their doctrine they ſpeake very oft of the ciuile workes of the heauenly law: But in the meane ſeaſon there is

nothing but that it ſmelleth and ſauoreth of the Calfe: that is to ſay, that the diſcipline, righteouſneſſe and the Philoſophicall vertues are there too much prayſed.
            For the two lips of the mouth, do ſignifie two ſorts and kindes of doctrines: the nether lip ſignifieth the explycation of the Law: and the vpper lyp the preaching of the Goſpell and of the heauenly promiſes.
