            To the Right honourable his very good Lord, Ambroſe Earle of Warwick, Maiſter of her Maieſties Ordinance, Knight of the noble order of the Garter, and one of her highneſſe moſt honourable priuie Councel, George Gifford wiſheth increaſe of al true happines & honour, with the continuall comfert of a good conſcience.
            
            
               I Nothing doubt (right honourable) but that it will ſeeme great raſhnes vnto ſome, and no ſmal folly, to offer and preſent ſo ſimple and ſlender a booke as this is, vnto your Lordſhip: for what doth it ſeeme to bring with it worthie the perſon of a Noble man? There is no pompe in the manner of ſpeech, for it is rude and country like: the matter it ſelfe is not handled as a diſputation betweene deepe diuines, but after the manner of plough men and cartars:

a great abſurditie therefore appeareth in this, that an honourable perſon of great dignitie ſhould be called for, as it were to ſtand by and hear ſuch ſpeak. Good cauſe there is therfore that I ſhold render ſom reaſon of this my boldenes, which I will willingly doe, to vſe that which the heathen Poet ſaith:
            Si canimus ſyluas, ſyluae ſunt conſule dignae.
            Will not ſuffice: for although reſpecting the things which I handle, becauſe they belong to the trees that are planted in the Lords Orchard, they doe as farre excel the woods and groues, as the vine doth the bramble buſh, yet neuertheleſſe he hath ſo richly decked his baſe & beggerly matter, hee hath ſo clothed it in ſilkes from top to toe, and hath hanged ſo many iewels vpon it: that it ſhal finde entertainement, and be thought meete for the courts of princes, where as mine being very porely clad, wil be reiected. I wil expreſſe therefore a better reaſon of my doing, which is this. As thoſe which haue corne fieldes, think it not a

thing vnmecte to be told by their ſeruāts of thiſtles & weedes, which would hinder & mar the corn, if they prouide not to haue them plucked vp: euē ſo I know that it is not an vnworthy thing to ſhew vnto thoſe which are of highe calling, the hurtful & dangerous weedes which would ouergrow and choke the heauē
               ly ſeed of the goſpel, ſowen in the Lords field. When as our church therefore & common wealth, being the Lords huſbandrie, is ouergrowne with weedes & almoſt laide waſte, I ſee no cauſe wherefore I may iuſtly be blamed, for giuing notice thereof in ſōe part vnto your honour. Seeing their principall cauſes and ſountaines frō whēce corruptiōs flow are to be taken away and dryed vp by thoſe whō God hath placed in the higheſt roomes. Among which the want of a ſincere miniſterie of the woorde is the greateſt through abſence of which, there is a flood of ignorance and darknes, ouerflowing the moſt part of the land: the feare of God is baniſhed from the greateſt

parte: the woonderfull heapes and piles of ſinne, which ſhould bee waſhed and cleanſed away by the word, do vndoubtedly with one voice cry alowd in the eares of the Lord, for vengeance vpon the whole realme. The papiſtes cannot be conuerted, but hardened & turned out of the way, there is ſo foule diſorder, and ſo many ſtumbling blockes caſt in the way. The Diuell hath elbowe roome to ſpread abroad, to plant & water all kinde of errours, ſo fewe there be to withſtand him. But to come to that particular which I hādle in this treatiſe: there are the moſt in number, who hauing Poperie taken from them and not taught throughly and ſufficiently in the Goſpel, doe ſtand as men indifferent, ſo that they may quietly inioye the world, they care not what religion come: they are like naked men fitte and readie for any coate almoſt that may bee put vpon them. The life of theſe is exceeding prophane they haue hardened thēſelues in their ſinnes, by reaſon which they gather

partly out of their owne braine, & partly out of ſome ſayings in the word, by which they cloke & defēd their own corrupt wayes. I haue therefore gathered the moſt commō principles of their faith and religion, by which they arme themſelues, againſt true repentance, and right vnderſtanding: I haue not noted all, neither haue I medled with thoſe ſeuerall groſſe abſurdities, whiche eache hath proper to himſelf, for that ſhould be infinite. I truſt your Lordeſhip will rightly conſtrue my good meaning, and take in good worth this ſimple treatiſe: pitying the caſe of the poore church of Chriſt, which is ſo ful of greeuous ſickneſſes and ſores, that vnleſſe ſhe be releeued and cured, ſhe wil ſcarce be able to continue life. She cannot but moſt humbly craue his dutie at the hands of thoſe which are neere about her deare Nurſe: From whom ſhe hath nowe long time receiued wonderfull protection and defence againſt aduerſaries: that they make knowne her ſtate, and labour the recovery

& retaining of her health. Becauſe it doth ſtand not only with their eternal glorye in the worlde to come, but alſo with their honourable eſtate in this life. Which cannot be eſtabliſhed to floriſh in continuance, vnleſſe the Lorde God haue his thrōe ſo erected in the middeſt of her that ſhe may floriſhe. For where he is diſhonored and diſpiſed of thoſe whom ſhee nouriſheth in her boſome, her caſe is daungerous, for it is againſt al wiſe pollicie to make him an aduerſarie, who hath all power, & of himſelfe is able to roote out and deſtroy mighty kingdomes: ſo that if ſhe keep in fauour & league with him, there is no feare of any other.
            This Lord of Lordes, and moſt mighty king increaſe abundātly in yee al heauenly & ſpirituall graces, with increaſe of honour in this world, to his glory &c your eternal comforte Amen.
            
               Your honours moſt humble to commaund George Gifford.
            
         
      
      
         
            
            ¶ A briefe diſcourſe of certaine pointes of the religion, whiche is among the common ſorte of Chriſtians: which may bee termed the Countrie diuinitie: with a plaine and manifeſt confutation of the ſame, after the order of a Dialogue.
            
               Zelotes. Atheos.
            
               Zelotes.
               VVEll ouertaken my friende.
            
            
               Atheos.
               I thanke you Syr.
            
            
               Zelotes.
               How farre doeye
                     •
                   trauell this way?
            
            
               Ath.
               Iwentie myles.
            
            
               Zelot.
               Doe you dwell in Eſſex.
            
            
               Ath.
               Yea, not farre from Clelmeforde.
            
            
               Zelot.
               What call yee the Towne where yee dwell?
            
            
               Ath.
               G. B.
            
            
               Zelot.
               Haue yee a preacher there?
            
            
               
               Ath.
               Wee haue an honeſt man our Curat.
            
            
               Zelot.
               Doth he teach his flock?
            
            
               Ath.
               Hée doth his good will, and more ye cannot require of a man.
            
            
               Zelot.
               Yee did commende him euen now, to be an honeſt man.
            
            
               Ath.
               Commende him: yea I maye commende him: I am perſwaded wee haue the beſte Prieſte in this Countreye, wee woulde bee lothe too forgoe him for the Learnedeſt of them all.
            
            
               Zelot.
               I praye ye let mee heare what his vertues bee, for which yee doe commend him ſo highly.
            
            
               Ath.
               Hee is as gentle a perſon as euer I ſee: a verye good fellowe, hee willnot ſticke when good Fellowes and honeſt men meete together too ſpende his groate at the Alehouſe: I cannot tell, they preache and preache, but hee doeth liue as well as the beſt of them all. I am afrayde when he is gone wée ſhall neuer haue the like againe.
            
            
               Zelot.
               Bee theſe the greate vertues whiche yee doe commende hym

for, hee maye haue all theſe, and yet be more meete for too keepe ſwine, then too bee a Sheaphearde ouer the flocke of Chriſte, is hee able to teache the people, and doeth hee inſtruct them in Gods woord?
            
            
               Ath.
               I knowe not what teaching yée woulde haue, hee doeth reade the ſeruice, as well as anye of them all, and I thinke there is as good edifiyng in thoſe prayers and Homilies, as in anye that the Preacher canne make: let vs learne thoſe firſt.
            
            
               Zelot.
               That is not all which is required in a Miniſter, for a boye of tenne yeeres olde canne doe all this: doeth hee not teache them too knowe the will of GOD and reprooue naughtineſſe among the people?
            
            
               Ath.
               Yes that hee doeth, for if there bee anye that doe not agree, hée will ſeeke for too make them friendes: for hee will gette them too playe a game or two at Bowles or Cardes, and too drynke together at the Alehouſe: I thynke it a Godlye waye, to make Charitie: hee is none of theſe buſie Controulers: for

if hée were, hée coulde not be ſo well liked of ſome (and thoſe not of the meaneſt) as he is.
            
            
               Zelot.
               Doe yee call the Preachers of Gods worde buſie Controulers? doe they goe further then Gods woorde doeth leade them?
            
            
               Ath.
               Wée may call them buſie controllers, I thinke we ſhall doe nothing ſhortly, as poore a man as I am, I woulde not for fortye ſhillinges that wee had one of them, there be more of my minde.
            
            
               Zelot.
               Some poore men perhaps.
            
            
               Ath.
               Naye, the beſt in the Pariſh, who would not ſo well like of our Curat, if hee ſhould meddle that way.
            
            
               Zelot.
               I perceiue nowe what manner of man your Curat is, and I ſee like maſter like ſcholler.
            
            
               Ath.
               Why ſo I pray yée?
            
            
               Zelot.
               Why ſo, I ſmell how vnmeete hee is, & alſo how ignorant you are. Let me queſtion a little while with yee concerning that which yee haue vttered.
            
            
               Ath.
               I truſt I haue vttered nothing but that whiche doeth beecome an honeſt man.
            
            
               
               Zelot.
               Nay all your ſpeech doeth beewraye that you are a carnall man, for you haue made a verye fine deſcription of a good Curate, what meane yee when yee ſay hee is a good fellowe, and will not ſticke to ſpende his money among good fellowes, is it not beecauſe hee is a potte companion?
            
            
               Ath.
               Doe yée miſlike good felowſhip, is it not lawfull for honeſt men to drinke and bee merrie together?
            
            
               Zelot.
               I doe not miſlike true friendſhip, whiche is in the Lorde, knitte in true Godlineſſe, but I miſlike this vice, which ouerfloweth euerie where, that Drunkardes meete togeather and ſitte quaffing, and the miniſter which ſhoulde reprooue them, to bee one of the chiefe: when hee ſhoulde bee at his ſtudie, to bee vpon the Alebench at Cardes or dice.
            
            
               Ath.
               I perceiue you are one of thoſe curious and preciſe fellowes, whiche will allowe no recreation, what woulde yée haue men doe? we ſhall doe nothing ſhortly. You would haue them ſitte mooping alwayes at their bookes, I like not that.
            
            
               Zelot.
               Nay my friende, I doe not allowe that recreation, whiche prophane

                  
                     〈1 page duplicate〉
                  
                  
                  
                     〈1 page duplicate〉
                  
                  
men call ſo, whiche is no recreation, but a torment to a Godly minde, to ſee men drunken, to heare them ſweare, and rayle, to ſpende their goodes and their time ſo lewdelie, and hee that ſhoulde teach them, to bee a Ringleader: as there bee manie as it ſeemeth, whiche are entred into the miniſterie, for none other purpoſe, but to liue an idle life, to haue leyſure to play at Cardes, or Tables, and Bowles all the Weeke. And therefore they haue no skill to teache, but like vnſauerie ſalte, are not good euen for the dunghill.
            
            
               Ath.
               Theſe thinges were vſed before you were borne, and will bee when you are gone. So long as men thinke no hurte when they play and be merry.
            
            
               Zelot.
               I perceiue yee are of the ryght ſtampe, yee are light vppon an argument, whiche may well be termed olde Suerſebee, becauſe it bringeth a reaſon whiche doeth ſticke by manye, when all other reaſons forſake them. But lett vs pull this olde fellowe out of his newe coat, and yee ſhall ſee what a leane ſhrimpe hee is, and ſo feeble, that hee cannot goe on ſtiltes: theſe thinges were vſed ſaye you, beefore you were borne, ſo were all other naughtie vices,

are they nowe good becauſe they bee olde? Becauſe men committed them before I was borne, and will doe when I am dead.
            
            
               Ath.
               I meane not ſo, but there were as wiſe men, and wiſer then hee nowe among our Forefathers: and they would not haue vſed nor allowed ſuch thinges, if they had not béene good: they knewe well enough what they did. Let not vs bée more preciſe thē they were.
            
            
               Zelot.
               I perceiue you grounde your faith and your doinges vpon men, and not vpon Gods worde.
            
            
               Ath.
               I praye GOD I may followe our Forefathers, and doe no woorſe then they did: what ſhoulde wee ſeeke for too bee wyſer or better then they: I woulde wée coulde doe but as well as they did.
            
            
               Zelot.
               Doe you not thinke that there were among our forefathers, theeues, murtherers, adulterers, drunkardes, and ſuche like?
            
            
               Ath.
               I thinke there haue béene alwayes euill dooers: and wilbe while the worldes end.
            
            
               
               Zelot.
               Woulde yee haue vs to followe thoſe, and to take their vices?
            
            
               Ath.
               Wee are not to follow any thing but that whiche is good: and thoſe whiche were godly and wiſe.
            
            
               Zelot.
               Is there anye thing good, but that which God ſetteth downe in his worde? and were any wiſe and Godly, but ſuch as did followe the will of GOD expreſſed in his word?
            
            
               Ath.
               There is nothing good but of GOD, and ſuche as doe as hee commaundeth.
            
            
               Zelot.
               Then you ſee olde ſureſebee layde flat vppon the grounde, and youre luſtye champion is manifeſted to bee but k
                     ••
                  ne and bones, and the ſame draugh rotten: for nowe by your owne confeſſion doeth followe that the woorde of God is the onely rule, and we muſt followe our Forefathers no further then they followe the woorde of God. You muſt not followe Dauid nor Abraham in euery thing they did. Furthermore alſo theſe naughtie vices and corrupte cuſtomes came from the wicked forefathers, & not from the godly, which followed gods word.
            
            
               Ath.
               That is true, but I will follow

our forefathers, nowe there is no loue, then they liued in friendſhippe, and made merrie together, nowe there is no good neighbourhood: nowe euerie man for himſelfe, and are readie to pull one another by the throate.
            
            
               Zelot.
               There are but a few of your mind in this thing, are there?
            
            
               Ath.
               Yes the greateſt parte: for I knowe almoſt none, but they will affirnie this matter.
            
            
               Zelot.
               If the greateſt part to bee of your mind, wherefore is there not then a greate deale of loue and freendſhippe where you ſay there is none: why doe yee not beeing the moſt in number, repayre the ruines of that olde faythfull friendſhippe, which yee ſay is decayed? yee ſaye that there was loue and friendſhippe, and yee ſeeme to lament the want of them, and yet there is none in your ſelues: for yee be very full of malice and ſtrife? is there any buzzarde ſo blinde, but that hee may eſpie your groſſe follie and vanitie in this point: whē with open mouth, ye cry for loue, loue, and bee the greateſt enemies thereunto your ſelues.
               Moreouer yee followe your owne fonde

and doating opinion, that yee imagine a thing whiche neuer was, for the Worlde hath euer beene like it ſelfe, full of debate and ſtrife, a verie fewe in all ages whiche haue had true loue: Againe, you call none loue, but that carnall loue, whiche is in eating and drinking, and other fooliſhe delightes. That whiche is the true loue, you condemne to bee hatred: For if a man admoniſhe and reprooue you for anie naughtie vice, which is the greateſt loue: by and by yee ſtampe and ſtare like madde men, and ſaye nowe there is no loue, except a man doe flatteryee, and bee partaker of your foule and beaſtlie ſinnes, yee are at deadlie hatred with him. But lett vs returne againe too Syr Robert, yee ſayde hee was as good a liuer as the beſt of them all.
            
            
               Ath.
               I ſaye ſo ſtill, for he is content with his liuing: many of your ſpirituall men are neuer ſatiſfied: for with that poore liuing he hath, he doth kéepe a good houſe and doeth féede the poore.
            
            
               Zelot.
               You proue him to bee a good Liuer, by comparing him with thoſe whiche are woorſe: It is all one

as if a manne woulde proofe a theefe whiche hath ſtollen twentie pounde too bee a good theefe, becauſe hee is not ſo euill as hee, whiche hath ſtollen a thouſande poundes.
            
            
               Ath.
               Yée doe not well to compare true men with theeues.
            
            
               Zelot.
               Is not he a theefe which doth take the hire and doth not that which hee ſhoulde doe for it?
            
            
               Ath.
               He is as good as a théefe, I thinke ſo.
            
            
               Zelot.
               Doe not they robbe them whiche take the liuing and doe not feede the flocke? Let mee aske yee a queſtion, if a man robbe and ſteale and then keepe a houſe, and feaſt his neighboures with it, and bee a Murtherer, will his good houſe keeping make him a good Liuer?
            
            
               Ath.
               No that it will not.
            
            
               Zelot.
               Let mee aske yee another queſtion, which is the worſe murtherer, hee whiche doth murther the body, or hee whiche doeth murther the ſoule?
            
            
               Ath.
               Hee whiche doeth murther the ſoule.
            
            
               
               Zelot.
               Then hee whiche ſhoulde feede mens bodies committed vnto hym, and doeth pine them to death, is a murtherer: and hee which ſhould feede mens ſoules and doth ſterue them, is a greater murtherer, and ſo his good houſe keeping cannot make him a good man, robbing ſo many, and killing ſo many.
            
            
               Ath.
               I will not beléeue that hee doth kill any.
            
            
               Zelot.
               That is becauſe yee will not beleeue the ſaying of Chriſte: if the blynde leade the blynde they both fal into the ditch, nor that God will ſaue men by the woorde preached.
            
            
               Ath.
               I hope wée bée not blinde, I truſt we beleeue all well.

               You are blinde and ſhould haue a guide to leade ye the way to heauen, and to inſtruct yee in true godlineſſe.
            
            
               Ath.
               I will not learne the way to heauen of anie man, for I hope I haue as good a faith and as good a ſoule to Godwarde as the beſt learned of them all.
            
            
               Zelot.
               Whereby doe you try your goodneſſe and your faith, any other way then by your owne blinde fantaſie?
            
            
               
               Ath.
               I meane well: I hurte no man: nor I thinke no man anye hurte: I loue God aboue all: and put my whole truſt in him: what woulde yee haue more? they preache and teache, they can tell vs no more but this: when they haue all ſaid what they can.
            
            
               Zelot.
               Nowe yee tumuble it vppe together in deede: I ſee well it is no ſmall trouble to bring an ignoraunt man, for to ſee his folly.

               What neede you learne when you knowe all afore hand euen as much as all the preachers can tell yee?

               Zelot.
               You ſaide that yee loue GOD aboue all: and you thinke no man no hurt, I take it your meaning is, that yee doe loue GOD with all your hearte, and your neighbour as your ſelfe, and more then this cannot be taught.
            
            
               Ath.

               This is all, is it not, what needeth

any more teaching.

               Ath.
               I haue no learning, but I thinke if men would doe this, it woulde not bee ſo euil as it is.
            
            
               Zelot.
               If euery thing whiche is ſpoken truely, be ſpoken wiſely, then you haue vttered a verye wiſe ſaying, for I am ſure there cannot be a truer. I beleeue indeede yee haue no learning, and I am ſure as you ſaye, if men ſhould doe that, there would not be ſo much euill among vs.

               All thinges are well ſpoken which are well taken: if they bee not wiſe I praye God make them wiſe: I haue nought to doe with them.
            
            
               
               Zelot.
               Yee are a playne man and haue skyll in outwarde thinges, will yee giue mee leaue to aske you a queſtion in a matter wherein yee haue vnderſtanding?
            
            
               Ath.
               I thanke God I dare anſweare to a queſtion.

               Ath.
               I haue no ſkill that way.
            
            
               Zelot.
               Then if there be a great houſe of tymber and ſtone, to buylde, you can not build it?
            
            
               Ath.
               If there were no better builders, then I, there woulde not bee ſo manye gaye houſes.
            
            
               Zelot.
               If one ſhoulde ſay here is a verie fayre houſe too bee buylded, it is no more but to laye a good foundation, too raiſe vp the walles and to finiſh the roofe, you knowe this all: therefore ye canne buyld it for ye know all.

               Ye ſay well, euen ſo to loue GOD with all our hearte, with all our mynde, and our neighbour as our ſelfe,

is all, but wee knowe not howe to doe one iotte of it, vnleſſe we be taught it out of gods worde.

               Zelot.
               Let mee nowe aske you further, put caſe one ſhoulde ſaye vnto you, thus, you know all that is to bee done in buylding an houſe: the foundation, the walles, and the roofe, doe theſe firſt, if yee will learne any more, yee may goe to ſome Carpenter.

               Zelot.
               It is the Counſell you gaue, and the wiſe men which yee ſpake of, which woulde haue men firſt to do and afterwarde to learne.

               It is a verie pitifull caſe to ſee, howe the worlde is blinded, yee bring not this out of your owne bouget: for there bee very manie wiſe and iollye heades, whiche ſtande muche vppon this which you ſpeake: they neuer vnderſtoode that whiche Solomon

They neuer conſidered what the holy Ghoſte ſaith in the latter ende of the fifte Chapter to the Hebrwes. ver. 12. Where he doth ſharply reprooue them, becauſe they were children in vnderſtanding. Neither doe they know that all well doing proceedeth from faith, & faith doth increaſe through knowledge: it greeueth me to ſtand vpon the matter, the ſaying is ſo buzzardly.

               If knowledge make men the woorſe, then is it a thing that is not good of it ſelfe, for that whiche is good can not make a man euill: is there any beaſt which will ſay, That to knowe GOD or the wil of

Wherewithall ſhall a young man clenſe his way euen by taking heed therto according to thy word. Now when men doe not vnderſtand the woorde, howe ſhall

               Such skilfull men as you, thinke if a man can preache or rather (as a number doe) prattle and haue a rowling tongue and can make ſome ſhewe of learning, that by and by hee is a trime man, and hath great knowledge: when as in deede hee hath no true knowledge. For I count him to haue true knowledge, whiche hath ſo learned Chriſte, that hee is become a newe creature. Therefore Saint Iohn in the 3. Chapter 5. 6. verſes, of his firſt Epiſtle ſpeaking of Chriſte, ſaith: That he was made manifeſt to take away our ſinnes, and in him is no ſinne: Whoſoeuer abideth in him ſinneth not. Whoſoeuer ſinneth hath not ſeene him nor knowne him. Likewiſe in the firſt booke of Samuel.

cap. 2. verſ. 12. It is ſaide by the ſonnes of Elye, that they were the ſonnes of Beliall, and knewe not God: and yet they were inſtructed in the lawe, and taught the people. And for mine owne part I coulde neuer perceiue that any wicked man coulde preache worth a button▪ I meane concerning, the cheefe thinge required in preaching, which is the declaration of the power of the ſpirite which ought for to appeare, to the conuerſion of ſinnefull men.

               Yes that it is, for Saint Iohn ſaieth, trie the ſpirites whether they be of God▪ Our Sauiour Chriſt ſayeth, my ſheepe heare my voyce a ſtraunger they will not heare. Wherevpon it doeth followe that hee which knoweth not when pure doctrine and wholeſome is vttered, is not as yet among the number of the ſheepe of Chriſt. For if he were indued with the ſpirit of God, he ſhoulde by the ſame ſpirite feele when wholeſome doctrine is deliuered vnto him.
            
            
               Ath.
               If a man bee learned, then hee ſhall bee able to iudge what is ſayle rightly:

otherwiſe hée cannot tell.
            
            
               Zelot.
               It is not learning alone whiche muſt iudge of ſound preaching, for there be manie learned men which cannot iudge wel, as alſo there bee manie vnlearned, which are verie well able to diſcerne, all lieth in this point the doctrine is of God, & not of men, and therefore thoſe doe feele it, and iudge rightly whether they be learned or vnlearned, whom God doth inwardly teach with his ſpirite: for this cauſe S. Paule. 1, Cor. 14. doth ſhewe that the worde of God is ſo to be layde open in the congregation, that if there come▪ in a man vnlearned or an infidell, hee may be reproued & iudged, & the ſecrets of his hearte made manifeſt. For if the word be not preached vnto the conſciences of men, it goeth away like a dead ſound.

               I kéepe the greateſt, and therefore I hope God will beare with mée in the reſt.

               Which doe ye take for to be the greateſt, that ye are ſo cleere in?
            
            
               
               Ath.
               I am no théefe, nor murtherer, nor traitour: I pay euerye man his owne▪ I thinke this is Gods bidding.

               Are there no greater then theſe?

               I take him for an honeſt man which doth kéepe theſe, and he that doeth not I defie him.

               Euen ſo wil I take you to be, when I knowe that you doe keepe them▪ But I maruell yee are ſo bolde for to bid defiance to ſo many.

               A man may knowe the tree by the fruites: but let this paſſe: I pray ye tell me is not he which hath moe Gods then one, as euill as a murtherer?

               Then the firſt commaundement is greater, then thoſe which you named?
            
            
               Ath.
               If a man thinke there is any God▪ but one, he is very farre wide.

               It were pitie of my life if I ſhoulde not bee of that beliefe. If all the commaundementes were as eaſie to bee kept as this, we ſhould doe well.
            
            
               Zelot.
               Then yee neuer brake the firſt Commaundement.

                   doubte but if a man can keepe the firſt hee can keepe all, for the firſt is as hard as any of the reſt, although ſuch skilfull Clearkes as you, count it to bee very eaſie.

and yet giueth that honour and worſhip vnto other thinges, which he ſhould giue vnto him alone.
            
            
               Ath.
               I did neuer put any truſt in images, nor I neuer thought they coulde doe mée any good.
            
            
               Zelot.
               I do not ſpeake of that outward giuing away of Gods worſhip: but of an other which is inward in the minde.
            
            
               Ath.
               I haue alwayes had God in my minde, and I truſt I haue neuer woorſhipped any beſides him.

               Is not that a mans God which hee loueth beſt: & which hee doeth moſt delight in?
            
            
               Ath.
               Looke what a man loueth beſt and taketh moſt delight in, I thinke hee maketh y• his god, becauſe we ought to loue god beſt.
            
            
               Zelot.
               Doe yee not thinke that the thing which a man moſt ſetteth his minde vpon, & moſt ſeeketh after, is that which he moſt loueth?
            
            
               Ath.
               I ſuppoſe euery man looketh after that which he moſt loueth.
            
            
               Zelot.
               Then he which ſeeketh the world more then God, loueth the world more then God: and therefore in very deede maketh the world his God?

               God forbid that any man ſhoulde make more account of this worlde, then of God, I hope fewe doe ſo.
            
            
               Zelot.
               You hope fewe doe ſo, but a man may eaſilie proue that youe doe ſo, and I am ſure the moſt doe ſo.
            
            
               Ath.
               I truſt yée ſhall hardly prooue it by mée, although yée iudge ſo euill of mée.
            
            
               Zelot
               Can a man ſeeke after God, or ſet his delight vpon God anie other waie, then by ſeeking after the knowledge and obedience of Gods will, which he hath reuealed in his word? or can a man loue God, and not loue his worde?
            
            
               Ath.
               Gods word is good, wee muſt loue that al of vs & be ruled by it, for it doth tell vs nothing but that which is good.
            
            
               Zelot.
               How ſlilie you wind out of the matter I aſke one thing which yee doe not aunſweare: and that is whether a man can ſeeke God, and not ſeeke him in his worde?
            
            
               Ath.
               Euery man cannot bee a Diuine, wée that bee vnlearned men are not for to meddle with ſo high matters.
            
            
               Zelot.
               Now ye ſpeake in your kinde, we be unlearned men, we haue nought to doe with God, we may not meddle with him.
            
            
               Ath.
               You take all thinges wrong,

yée doe not heare the ſay ſo.
            
            
               Zelot.
               Doe I take yee wrong, doe ye not ſay ſo? tell me is not God as high a matter as his word?
            
            
               Ath.
               God is aboue all.
            
            
               Zelot.
               Can we haue to doe with God, to ſerue him any way but by his worde?
            
            
               Ath.
               The worde of GOD doeth tell by what wée are to doe.
            
            
               Zelot.
               Then it followeth when yee ſaye wee may not meddle with ſo high matters, that yee were euen as good for to ſay, wee haue nought to doe with GOD. Wee owe him no duetie of obedience, we need not care to know his will: becauſe he is as high a matter as his word.
            
            
               Ath.
               You put in a greate deale more then I ſayde, and take mee ſtill at the woorſt.
            
            
               Zelot.
               Naye you are ſo deepe in youre ſpeeche, that yee vtter more in a woord, then a man can well lay open in an houres talke: Againe I take yee not at the worſt, for make the beſt of it you can, and it muſt needes follow, that thoſe which care not for the worde of God, care not for him, neither doe they delight in him, or loue him whiche doe not delight in him nor loue his worde.
               
                  Moreouer howe ſhall a man take delight for to knowe the woorde, but it will cauſe him for to ſeeke to knowe it, that which is a mans iewell hee will ſome times looke vppon it: but there are a number of yee which are in deede verie Atheiſtes, and ſet no
                     •
                   a ſtrawe by the knowledge of Gods will: for let a man tell ye of any dutie which ye ſhould be taught out of the holy ſcriptures, by and by, this is your aunſweare, thoſe thinges are not for vs to meddle withall: it is not for vs to talke of ſuche pointes. But we are gone a great way from the beginning of this matter, whiche is, that where yee did affirme that yee loue God with all your hearte, and that yee haue none other Gods beſides him: Now the concluſion is proued, that yee loue him as much as an old ſhoe, and that in deede yee make the worlde your God, becauſe ye ſeeke moſt after that.
            
            
               Ath.
               Yee doe not vſe me well in ſaying that I loue GOD no better then an olde ſhoe, I woulde yée ſhould knowe I loue him as wel as the beſt of yée all, though indéede I cannot ſay ſo much.

ye make ſo great boaſt▪ I pray ye tell me this, ye haue ſeruants haue ye not?
            
            
               Ath.

               What doe you require of your ſeruant?
            
            
               Ath.
               To obey my will and to doe that which I command him.
            
            
               Zelot.
               What if he care not ſo muche, as to knowe your will, but will ſaye: I will not meddle with ſo high matters, nothyng regardyng to knowe your pleaſure: will yee ſay he loueth yee, or hee is a good ſeruant?
            
            
               Ath.
               I cannot ſay that he is a good ſeruant, for if he were he would not take ſkorn but be glad to heare my will.
            
            
               Zelot.
               Ye ſay right, but why doe ye not conſider that, when God hath ſet downe his wil & you care not for to know it, that ye loue him as well and doe him as good ſeruice, as ſuch a ſeruant ſhould doe vnto you.
            
            
               Ath.
               God helpe, if this which you ſaye hée true.
            
            
               Zelot.
               It is moſt true, not only that men make the world their GOD, becauſe they ſeeke more after it then they doe after Gods kingdom, but alſo S. Paule calleth the Diuell the God of this world, as alſo in another

place he ſayth, there bee ſome whoſe God is their bellie.
            
            
               Ath.
               God forbid that any man ſhould take the diuell to bee GOD, or doe him ſuch honour.
            
            
               Zelot.
               They are no ſmall number which make him their God.
            
            
               Ath.
               You may ſay ſo, but I could neuer come into that mans company yet, whiche would not vtterly defie him.
            
            
               Zelot.
               If I ſhould profeſſe great kindnes vnto you now, and in the meane time drawe my dagger and breake your pate, woulde yee beleeue I were your friend?
            
            
               Ath.
               I pray God keepe mee from ſuch friendes: which giue good wordes and doe euill deedes, I had rather they tolde me their hatred.
            
            
               Zelot.
               Then ye anſwere that we muſt not looke what men ſay, but what they doe.
            
            
               Ath.
               They had better not ſpeake well, then ſpeake well and doe euill.
            
            
               Zelot.
               Likewiſe I anſwere you that we muſt not looke to mens woords, when they defie the Diuell, but to their deedes by which they obey him and doe his will: for when they defie him in their wordes, they honour him for God in their workes.
            
            
               
               Ath.
               If there be any ſuch, I pray GOD amende them, for that is the woorſt which I wiſh them.
            
            
               Zelot.
               I coulde like your prayer well if it were not only for a faſhion, as yee vſe many ſuch like. For when it commeth to the trial, you wil eaſily be found amōg the number of ſuch.

               If yée thinke mee to bee ſuche an one, yee iudge woorſe then euer any man did, I thank GOD I can bring manye to teſtifie that I am an honeſt man and alwayes haue beene, I will bee founde as good as your ſelfe, though yée finde ſo greate faulte with other, as though yee were not like other men.
            
            
               Zelot.
               I iudge nothing but that which is eaſie to ſee, in you and in a number more, and which I canne, and will proue to your face.

               Zelot.
               Hee whiche cannot ſpie yee, hath but a ſimple vnderſtanding: I pray yee tell mee, ſuch as doe the workes and will of the Diuell, are they not of the Diuell? Saint Iohn 1. Epiſtle 3. ſayth, Hee that committeth

euill is of the Diuell. Likewiſe our Sauiour Chriſt telleth the obſtinate Iewes, Ioh. 8. Which boaſted themſelues to bee the children of Abraham, and the children of God, that they were of their father the Diuell, and why? becauſe they did his will. Euen ſo you take part with ſuch as are euill, and wicked. Shall ye aske a little queſtion?
            
            
               Ath.
               Yea, aſke what yée will, and iudge what yee like beſt: but I will aunſweare as well as I can.
            
            
               Zelot.
               Doe ye not thinke that al whoremaſters, Drunkardes, Dicers, Raylers, Swearers, and ſuche like, are the Diuels armie, as on the other ſide, ſuch as profeſſe gods word and liue godly, are his ſouldiers, and do fight vnder his banner?
            
            
               Ath.
               They are well holpen vp which ſerue ſuch a maſter.
            
            
               Zelot.
               Why are you ſo vnwiſe then as to ſerue him: for all thoſe which take part with thoſe wicked men, & raile vpon thoſe which are godlie, doe fight vnder the ſame ſtanderd, and ſeeke to vphold the kingdome of the Diuell, labouring for to ouerthrow the Goſpel, and to baniſh Gods word?
            
            
               Ath.
               They are woorthie to haue their eares cut from their head, which rayle vppon

honeſt men or ſeeke to ſlaunder them.
            
            
               Zelot.
               This is a common thing among all the packe of ye, if there be any man which hath a care to know God, and ſeeketh after his worde, & will not cōmit thoſe beaſtly ſins which ouer flow in all places, then you which cannot abide to haue Gods word ſet foorth, deniſe a number of lies and ſlaunders againſt them, calling them Puritanes, raſcals, and many ſuch like. On the contrary part, let a man be a common drunkarde, a Dicer, an ignorat beaſt which hath no knowledge of God, a wretched worldling, or any kinde of ſuche perſon: he is an honeſt man: for they be thoſe whom you woulde haue a man loſe his eares for: he is now counted the honeſt man which liueth as the moſt doe.
            
            
               Ath.
               There bee a number goe ſo farre they cannot tell what they may doe: they will not doe as their honeſt neighbours doe, they wilbe wiſer then their betters: what ſhoulde they meddle with Gods woorde, it maketh

               Zelot.
               I maruell how far you would go if a man ſhoulde followe ye, yee are like a puddle, which the more a man ſtirreth it, the more filthie mud ariſeth: yee are like a ſinke, where

the more a man ſtirreth, the more is the ſtink.

               What meane ye by that?
            
            
               Zelot.
               I mean that your heart is full of foule ſlinking & rotten matter, which floweth out at your mouth. I confeſſe that thoſe men bee not to be allowed which meddle with that which they ſhould not: but I know whom you meane, when ye ſay they goe ſo farr, that they know not what they may doe: ye ſpeake of them which ſeek to know GOD, whom ye thinke to be halfe madde.
            
            
               Ath.
               There be ſome of them which are not book learned, what ſhould they doe otherwiſe then their fathers before them: I knew ſome of their fathers, honeſt men, and neuer troubled themſelues that way.
            
            
               Zelot.
               I did know your mind wel enough: for al your ſpite is againſt thoſe which learne out of Gods word to know their duety towards the lord: & becauſe as S. Pet. ſaith, 1. Pe. 4. they do not run with ye to the ſame exces of riot, ye think it ſtrange & blaſphemy. Agayn, ye cannot abide to be admoniſhed, when ye commit any naughty thing. Ye know not that God hath appoynted his word for all ſortes of mē to be inſtructed in it throughly, for the holy Apoſtles exhort euery where vnto great knowledge in the worde.
               Againe ye know not that which the Lorde

cōmandeth in ſundrie places, that we ſhould admoniſhe, and reprooue one another, if any do amiſſe: & not as you blind obſtinate men, which when a man doeth after a godlie manner admoniſh yee: hee is by and by a buſie medler, what hath he to doe, he ſhall not anſwere for you. And becauſe yee may not doe what lewdnes yee liſt, vncontrolled, yee ſay it was neuer merry ſince euery man might, read the ſcriptures. It is maruellous that men ſhould ſo become beaſtes without all vnderſtanding.
            
            
               Ath.
               It would not gréeue me to bée reprooued by thoſe which are learned, but now euery Iacke wilbe medling.
            
            
               Zelot.
               If you be reproued iuſtly by Gods worde, then is it God which doth reproue, ye are not to looke vppon the man. But when ye call them Iackes, and giue them other reproches, it is becauſe yee are blinde, and can diſcerne nothing but that whiche is of this worlde: For if yee could ſee how great glorie the pooreſt true Chriſtian is called vnto, to be the child of God, yee woulde not reuile thoſe whom God honoureth.

                  n muſt not bee hindered: For it is death to yee to haue any godlineſſe ſpoken of, if it be, ye cannot bee merry. This dunghill mirth is that which men complaine of to be moleſted, and ſay it was happie in olde time, when men were not reproued for ſuch things, now there be ſo many ſcripture men, that a man cannot tell what to ſay or what to doe.

               There are none of yée all as holie as yée woulde ſéeme for to be, but haue faultes, yée ſée not your owne, but other mens.
            
            
               Zelot.
               Hee which doeth not repente and correct his own vitious nature and ſtriue to obey God, is no good reproouer of others: But when yee ſay, men ſeeme to be holy and giue it as a matter of reproch, therein yee goe almoſt beyond the Diuell himſelfe: for you ſee that I gaineſaie yee, or els yee woulde not inure it, but yee would euen Powre out your ſtinking & rotten poyſon like blaſphemous and venemous beaſtes: ye would ſpeake after

this manner you that are ſo full of the ſpirite, you that are Saintes and ſuch like. What are you diuelles, are yee of the fleſh? no doubt yee are vntil God conuert ye. But we may ſee how diueliſhly men are become wicked: when a man cannot make any appearance to be godly and holy, but it is reproched as though it were a ſhameful thing to be led by the ſpirite. For otherwiſe why do they ſo obiecte an honeſt thing to liue after the fleſhe, a ſhamefull matter to be guided by the ſpirite.

               God helpe vs if none be good but ſuch, I hope honeſt and quiet men ſhalbe ſaued as well as they, although they cannot talke ſo well, nor runne not to heare Sermons.
            
            
               Zelot.
               Nay you would haue others in berter caſe then they, for you iudge them that are zealous in the Goſpel and woulde faineſt of all other pleaſe God, to be the worſt men, and the more carefull a man is to be holy to the Lorde, the more he is diſdayned and miſliked. Which doeth euidently ſhewe that ſuch as you are led by the ſpirite of the Diuell. Yee leade me ſo from one matter to another, that wee are gone from ſomething which ye vttered. I remember yee ſaide yee put your whole truſt in God.
            
            
               
               Ath.
               I ſayd ſo, & ſo I ſay ſtill: though I haue no learning, yet I truſt I beleeue as well as any ſcripture man of them all.
            
            
               Zelot.
               Yee bragge very boldly, I pray ye tell me this, are yee ſure ye ſhalbe ſaued?

               Zelot.
               What is it that yee put all your whole truſt in him for? Is it not this, that GOD hath promiſed vnto yee eternal life, and that yée beleeue he wil performe his promiſe?
            
            
               Ath.
               That hee doeth loue me and giueth me all thinges.

               Are yee not ſure that hee doth loue yee?

               I hope he doth loue me: but I am not ſure.
            
            
               Zelot.
               Doeth not the ſcripture ſaye that whoſoeuer doth truſt in him ſhalbe ſaued?
            
            
               Ath.
               God ſayth ſo indeede, and I beleeue it is ſo.
            
            
               Zelot.
               You knowe doe yee not, that yee put your whole truſt and beliefe in him?
            
            
               Ath.
               I knowe I doe: and I hope I ſhall alwayes doe.
            
            
               
               Zelot.
               If God can not lie, when hee ſaith all that truſt in him ſhall bee ſaued, and you knowe that yee put your whole truſt in him, Wherefore doe yee not then knowe that yee ſhalbe ſaued?
            
            
               Ath.
               That which God ſayth, is true, for he cannot lie: I put my truſt in none but in him: I hope to be ſaued, what would yée haue more? I will beléeue neuer a one of them all when they ſay they know they ſhalbe ſaued: I thinke they woulde make them ſelues Gods.

               Naye ſuche as you make your ſelues Gods, when yee ioyne thinges ſo contrary together and can make them agree: fire and water may lodge together in one bedde, at your inne, and agree well together: For they are no more contrary then that whiche yee affirme, when yee ſay God hath promiſed that all which beleeue in him ſhall bee ſaued, you are ſure yee beleeue in him and that ye put all your whole truſt in him & yet yee can not tell whether yee ſhall bee ſaued. But I can not greatly maruell at this, for yee knowe as well what faith is, as doeth a Gooſe.

               Ath.
               Wée muſt beléeue that which we ſpeake when wee praye, or els it is nothing woorth.

               When Chriſt teacheth vs too pray, and too call GOD our Father, ought we not for to knowe that he is our Father?
            
            
               Ath.
               Wee ought for to knowe, that which GOD teacheth vs and to beleeue the ſame.
            
            
               Zelot.
               Muſt wee not beleeue it without doubting or wauering, as S. Iames ſayth hee that doubteth is like vnto a waue of the Sea toſſed with the winde, neither let that man thinke that he ſhall receiue any thing?
            
            
               Ath.
               Wée muſt not doubt, for hée that doubteth is in a wrong beléefe, we muſt put all our truſt in God.
            
            
               Zelot.
               Then when ye call GOD Father ye beleue that ſurely which ye ſpeak, then are ye ſure that he loueth yee, for a father doeth loue his childe, euen men which are euill doe giue good giftes vnto their children when

they aſke, becauſe they loue thē, much more, the heauenly Father which is perfectly good doeth loue his children, that is, thoſe whiche beleeue in him: then I reaſon in this wiſe, hee that beleeueth ſurely that GOD is his father, he is ſure that GOD loueth him: hee that is ſure god loueth him is ſure of euerlaſting life: therefore all thoſe which pray aright, are ſure they ſhalbe ſaued.
            
            
               Ath.
               I pray God wee may call vppon him.

               Tell mee further what ye thinke, was not Abraham ſure he ſhoulde bee ſaued, likewiſe Dauid, Paul, and others?
            
            
               Ath.
               Euerye man cannot bee like thoſe. Can you ſaye yee are like vnto Abraham?
            
            
               Zelot.
               Doeth not the ſcripture ſay, that Abraham is the father of the faithfull, and that thoſe are the children of God, whiche walke in the ſteppes of faithfull Abraham? I confeſſe in deede that euery one cannot attaine to ſo great a meaſure of fayth as thoſe had: but yet wee muſt come to the ſame faith, becauſe we haue the ſame GOD, the ſame couenant and promiſes, the ſame ſpirit is giuen vnto vs which beleeue, Saint

Paule in the 4. chap. the Epheſians ſaith: there is one God, one faith, one baptiſme. If there be but one, then ours muſt bee the ſame that theirs was.
            
            
               Ath.
               Yea, but for al that it is preſumption for men to ſay they knowe they ſhalbee ſaued.
            
            
               Zelot.
               I ſee that popiſh dung doth ſticke ſtil between your teeth, when they teach men that it is preſumption to be out of doubt.
            
            
               Ath.
               What tell ye mee of the Pope, I care not for him, I woulde both hee and his Dung, were buried in the Dunghill.
            
            
               Zelot.
               I knowe there be many which care not for the Pope, but yet beleeue muche of his doctrine: they bee thoſe whiche wee call Athieſts, of no religion, but looke whatſoeuer any prince doeth ſet forth, that they will profeſſe.
            
            
               Ath.
               I thinke that is good, ought not wée for to obey our Princes, and woulde yee haue vs to take vpon vs for to bee wiſer then they and their Counſellers?
            
            
               Zelot.
               I did knowe yee were an Athieſt, ſetting vp menne in the place of

God worſe then a Turke.
            
            
               Ath.
               Wherefore doe yée ſay ſo?
            
            
               Zelot.
               Tell me this, are wee for to obeye men if they commaunde that which is contrary to that which God commaundeth?
            
            
               Ath.
               I thinke not ſo.
            
            
               Zelot.
               Is there any mo then one trueth, or one religion, which is the right, and that which God commaundeth?
            
            
               Ath.
               There can be but one truth, that is certaine.
            
            
               Zelot.
               Then when one Prince commandeth one religion, another ariſeth afterwarde and commaundeth the contrarie: Will yee without difference obey them both? is not this for to denie God? is not this for to bee worſe then a Turke?
            
            
               Ath.
               I am ſure yée will not denie, but that wée muſt obey.
            
            
               Zelot.
               Hee whiche doeth diſobeye the Prince, doeth diſobey GOD, vnto his damnation, where the prince ſetteth foorth and mainteyneth Gods worde. But if there be a prince whiche maketh lawes againſt the lawes of God, wee muſt obey GOD rather then men. But there are many as I ſaid before whiche in anye Princes dayes will ſpeake thus, if religion ſhoulde turne (ſaye they) as

God forbid it ſhoulde, but if it doe, it is our partes to be obedient. Are not theſe Atheiſtes, haue they not denied GOD, when they ſet men in his place? And looke no higher but what men commande. But yee haue drawne me away againe from the matter wee were in hand with, where ye ſayd it is preſumption for a man to ſay he knoweth he ſhalbe ſaued: I may aske ye a queſtion I know ye will anſwere very boldely.
            
            
               Ath.
               I knowe no cauſe why I ſhoulde not anſwere boldly.
            
            
               Zelot.
               Yee ſay true, for blinde bayarde is the boldeſt horſe in the cart, although he bee almoſt drowned in one ſlowe yet hee will not ſticke at another, he will through when all the reſt wil ſtraine curteſie. But let vs come to the matter whether is it greater preſumption for to beleeue that God is true, or for to doubt of the certaintie of his promiſe? & whether doeth that man honoure GOD moſt which giueth credit to his word, or hee which doubteth whether he will perfourme the ſame?
            
            
               Ath.
               It muſt néeds be graunted that he which beléeueth God of his word doeth wel, and he that doth not doth euill.
            
            
               
               Zelot.
               Yee ſay true, for if a Prince make an offer vnto ſome man, whō he fauoureth, and he ſhould make aunſweare, I doubt of it, I ſcarce beleeue the performance of your promiſe: would not the Prince thinke him ſelfe greatly diſhonoured to haue it doubted, whether he be a man of his word? If he ſhou'd ſweare for the performance of his promiſe, & the party not truſt him, he would neuer put that vp, or beare ſuch an iniury. Then it muſt needs follow that whē God hath bound himſelfe both by promiſe and by oth, as it is ſaid Heb. cap. 6. ver. 17. How great preſumption is it not for to beleeue him? it is all one as too thinke God may lie, or that he may bee forſworne, which is horrible blaſphemy.
            
            
               Ath.
               I graunt this is true, if God ſhould tell any man that he ſhould be ſaued, if he did not then beleeue him. But where is that man which can ſay God euer tolde him ſo? Doth he tel any one man ſo?
            
            
               Zelot.
               Yea that he doth, for that which he ſendeth vnto al in generall, he ſēdeth vnto euery one in particular: for is it not all one, if a man be condemned for treaſon, to haue his pardon ſēt him being but one man alone, or hauing a great ſort mo condēned vnto death with him, a general pardon is ſent fo

               That is al one, for he hath his part in it.
            
            
               Zelot.
               Euen ſo is it betweene God and vs, we were all condemned, he hath ſent a generall pardon to as many as beleeue the ſame, that whoſoeuer truſteth in Chriſt hee ſhalbee ſaued. God therefore hath tolde ſome men, that is, ſuch as beleeue that they ſhalbe ſaued, and ſuch as doubt of his promiſe and his oth they ſhalbe damned. Therefore is it al one in thoſe which beleeue, as if he had ſent a particular meſſage vnto them.

               Zelot.
               Becauſe ye care not for ſeeking

after eternall life, yee are content to accept of nothing: and becauſe yee loue your luſtes, and hate to be refourmed, yee abhorre the vſe of preaching, and as poore a man as yee are, ye would not for xl. ſhillings ye had a Preacher among you.
            
            
               Ath.
               Yée euer take me at the woorſt, I allowe preaching▪ it is good nowe and then, but ſome can kéepe no meaſure nor tel when they haue done: Agayne they bee ouer hott and ſeuere, and preache damnation to the people. Likewiſe they meddle with ſuche matters as they néede not, as Election and Predeſtination, what ſhoulde ſuche matters be ſpoken of among the people, they make men woorſe?
            
            
               Zelot.
               I thinke the Diuell is the cunningeſt ſchoolemaſter in the worlde. Other ſchoolemaſters cannot bring groſſe heades and dullards to any paſſe, but content themſelues with the finer wits, for to trayne them vp in learning: but a man can almoſt light vppon none of his ſchollers, bee they neuer ſuche blockheads, but they haue their leſſon at their fingers ends.
            
            
               Ath.
               I thanke yée Sir for your good woorde: But I neuer learned it of the Diuell, nor neuer was any of his ſchollers: I

truſt I haue as little to doe with him as you or any other.
            
            
               Zelot.
               Where did yee learne it then, if not of the Diuell?
            
            
               Ath.
               I haue heard honeſt men ſpeake it, and ſome Preachers preach it.
            
            
               Zelot.
               Then I perceiue ye learned it not of the Diuel himſelfe, but at the mouth of ſome of his Vſhers.
            
            
               Ath.
               Wherefore doe y

               Zelot.
               I call them ſo becauſe they teach the precepts of the Diuell. And although they haue ſome knowledge in the woorde, yet they neuer learned theſe thinges whiche you ſpeake out of the word.
            
            
               Ath.
               Did the Diuell teach them berauſe they haue it not in Gods word?
            
            
               Zelot.
               It is the doctrine of the Diuell, becauſe it is againſt Gods word. For GOD neuer teacheth▪ men thoſe thinges whiche are contrary to the doctrine which he hath ſet downe in his worde.
            
            
               Ath.

                  ▪ theſe thinges for too bee againſt Gods worde.
            
            
               
               Zelot.
               I woulde you coulde as eaſilye proue yourſelfe to bee a good man: for then we ſhould ſoone agree.
            
            
               Ath.
               You are not for to iudge of mee no more then I am for to iudge of you: but there be many now a dayes which will take vppon them for to iudge men: they doe not learne that out of Gods woorde, I am ſure.
            
            
               Zelot.
               If I ſee a man drunken, or heare him ſweare or raile and ſuch like, and ſay, he is a naughty man, doe I iudge: ſhall I account him a good man, when I ſee hee is naught?
            
            
               Ath.
               When a man doth ſee thoſe naughty vices, he may boldely ſay that ſuch men are naught.
            
            
               Zelot.
               In like maner when a man heareth one which holdeth euill and abhominable opinions againſt the truth, he may as boldely ſay he is naught: becauſe they haue giuen iudgement of them ſelues, and haue ſhewed what they are. Nay they be ſuche as you whiche take vppon yee for to iudge: for let a man be more carefull then your ſelues for to ſerue GOD: and by and by you will enter into the ſecrets of his heart, which God onely doth know, and ye will not

ſticke for to pronounce that he is an hypocrite. In the meane time, let a man tell you that ye are wicked, when he doth ſee your wickedneſſe, ye aunſwere, ye ought not to iudge: but I will come for to proue that the thinges which yee ſpeake againſt preaching, are verie diueliſhe and wicked. Ye ſaid thus, I allowe preaching, it is good now and then, but ſome can keepe no meaſure, nor will neuer haue done.
            
            
               Ath.
               I ſayd ſo in deede, I will not denie my worde, and I thinke ſo ſtill. For a man may haue ouermuch of any thing, & ynough is as good as a feaſt.
            
            
               Zelot.
               A very little is ynough for you, if the Preacher doe paſſe his houre but a little, your buttokes beginne for to ake, and ye wiſhe in your hearte that the Pulpit would fall.
            
            
               Ath.
               Ye may geſſe twiſe before yee geſſe ſo right.
            
            
               Zelot.
               Nay I canne geſſe ſomewhat neere in ſuche a man as yee are: but I praye yee did yee neuer ſitte at Cardes all night?
            
            
               Ath.
               Yes that I haue, and thought it but a ſhort night too.
            
            
               Zelot.
               The cauſe why yee thinke an

houre ſo long at a Sermon, & a whole night ſo ſhort at Cardes, is, that ye delight in the one and care not for the other: the carding is ioyned with much ſinne and ſeruice of the Deuill, the other is for to bring vs vnto the knowledge and feare of GOD: Marke nowe howe much by your owne confeſſion ye loue the Diuell more then GOD? for him doe ye loue moſt, whom ye delight to ſerue moſt.
            
            
               Ath.
               Can wee not ſerue God without ſo much preaching? I ſee they are neuer the better which runne moſt after ſermons, they talke much, but I woulde haue them leaue talking and fall to doing, wee ſée no doing but men are ſtill euen as euill as beefore.
            
            
               Zelot.
               Can your ſeruant ſerue you vnleſſe he know your will?
            
            
               Ath.
               No that hée cannot.
            
            
               Zelot.
               No more can you ſerue GOD without the knowledge of his will, and as for the reſt of your ſpeech, when ye crie out againſt preaching of Gods woorde, that it maketh men neuer the better, and ye would haue them leaue talking, and fall to doing: I confeſſe there be a number which are counterfeite profeſſors which liue not according

to the Goſpell, and moſt commonly they be ſuch, as haue but a little ſmacke of the Goſpel, and yet thinke they know much, becauſe they want the meanes, hauing the worde either ſeldome or looſely preached. But I will confute your vanitie another waye in this point, tell me, are not theſe your ſayinges? where the woorde is ſincerely preached▪ if any ſeeke to frame their liues after the ſame, when they doe eyther by woorde reprooue your euill wayes, or by deede refuſe your lewde maners: Theſe men are full of the Spirite, theſe are preciſe fellowes, theſe are holie Saintes, theſe thinke them ſelues Gods fellowes: theſe thinke them ſelues better then all other men.
            
            
               Ath.
               We ſay ſo in deede, there is good cauſe why.
            
            
               Zelot.
               Then I pray ye tell me howe theſe two thinges can hang together, when ye ſaie there is no amendement of life, and yet yee complaine that they be ouer full of the ſpirit, ouer preciſe, and ſuch like. May not euery man ſee, that ye pronounce thinges directly contrarie the one to the other? that there is no amendment, and yet in effect, ye ſay, they amende ouer▪ faſt.
            
            
               Ath.
               Wee doe not ſaye that any doe amende

ouer faſt.
            
            
               Zelot.
               When ye ſay they are ouer holy, and what ſhoulde men be ſo curious and full of the ſpirite, what is this but to ſay, that they amende ouer faſt? Is not this to amend when men by due inſtruction out of Gods woorde come to repentaunce of their former vices? and haue a care to keepe them ſelues from the ſpottes of the rotten fleſhe and filthie worlde. Do not you and ſuch as you are after a ſort blaſpheme, when yee reproche men with the ſpirite? Is it a ſhame for a man nowe a dayes for to haue anye thing to doe with the ſpirite of God? While a man doeth walke after the fleſhe in the luſtes of vncleanneſſe, he is an honeſt man: But ſo ſoone as hee is indued with any grace, ye wonder at him as crowes do at an owle, yee are readie to floute and mocke him out of his skinne. And as if the ſpirite of GOD were a ſpirite of diſhonour and ſhame, yee mocke men with him. Wee may wonder at the longe patience of GOD, which hath thus many yeeres ſuffered himſelfe to be diſhonoured, his ſpirite reuiled, his woorde deſpiſed, and hath not been reuenged, but no doubt the longer hee hath 
                     •
                  aried, the heauier will the ſtroke be.
            
            
               Ath.
               Men are men, what ſhoulde they

make themſelues more holy then they be?
            
            
               Zelot.
               If ye meane one way ye ſay right, for it is a naughtie vice for men to ſeeme to be holy when they are not, or to ſeeme to be more holy then they be: but if yee meane another way (as I thinke ye doe) that becauſe men are ſinfull by nature, why ſhoulde they ſeeke for to be better, then doe ye ſpeake verie wickedly. For God calleth men to repentance, to turne from their euill wayes: God guideth his ſeruants at all times with his ſpirite, therfore S. paule ſayth Rom. 8. There Is no condemnation nowe to thoſe whiche are in Chriſt Ieſus, which walke not after the fleſhe, but after the ſpirite. And againe in the ſame chapter, As many as are led by the ſpirite of God, are the ſonnes of God. Hee ſayth that if wee liue after the fleſhe, we ſhall dye: in other places he doth ſhewe, whiche are the workes of the ſpirite, and whiche are the workes of the fleſhe: And you like blaſphemous wretches allowe thoſe whiche walke after the fleſh, and condemne thoſe which are led by the ſpirite.
            
            
               Ath.
               Are none indued with Gods Spirite, but ſuch as runne to heare preaching?
            
            
               Zelot
               Whoſoeuer hath the ſpirite of

God, can not but delight in the woorde of God, whiche the ſame ſpirite hath vttered: The Lorde ſaith, hee which is of God, heareth Gods worde: The happie man is hee (as wee haue in the 1. Pſalme) whiche hath his delight in the lawe of the Lorde, and which doeth meditate in the ſame day and night? We haue in the pſalme 112. Bleſſed is the man which feareth the Lorde, hee hath great delight in his commaundements.
               Moreouer, the ſpirite of GOD doeth not guide men without the woorde. And therefore it is ſaide Pſalme 119. Thy woorde is a lanterne vnto my feete, and a light vnto my pathes. S Peter ſayth, I. Epiſt. 1. Hee hath beegotten vs againe not of mortall but of immortall ſeede, which he affirmeth to bee the worde of God that indureth for euer. Likewiſe S. Iames ſaith cap. 1. of his owne good will begat hee vs, by the woord of trueth. Seeing therfore that the holy Ghoſt doth guide men by the worde, it followeth that all thoſe which ſet light by the woorde, are led, not with the ſpirite of God, but with the ſpirite of the Diuell. I might alleadge a number of teſtimonies of Scripture to prooue that ſuch as you which make ſo ſmall accompt of the ſacred woorde of God, as there be a number,

yea the greateſt number whiche doe not ſet ſo muche by it as they doe by an olde ſhoe, are deſpicers of God, worſe then brute beaſtes.
            
            
               Ath.
               Cannot men be lead by Gods ſpirit and ſerue God, vnleſſe they knowe the Scriptures▪ GOD forbidde that all thoſe ſhoulde bee awry which are not learned: is it not enough for plaine countrie men, plow men, taylours, and ſuche other, for to haue their ten commaundementes, the Lordes prayer, and the beliefe: I thinke theſe may ſuffice vs, what ſhoulde wee meddle further: I knowe men whiche are no ſcripture men, whiche ſerue GOD as well as the beſt of them all. Will yee condemne ſuch?
            
            
               Zelot.
               I ſayde before that men can not be lead by Gods ſpirite, and refuſe to knowe the Scriptures: Neyther can they truelie ſerue him vntill ſuche time as they knowe howe for to ſerue him: for GOD teacheth howe he will be ſerued, and hee teacheth onlie in his worde: his will is that we ſhal learne to know him by his worde. And therefore he hath appointed the Miniſterie of the woorde to continue for euer in his Church, that by it men may be built vp in Chriſte, as yee may

reade Ephe. 4. For this cauſe S. Paule▪ exhorteth Tymothie to bee inſtant in teaching in ſeaſon & out of ſeaſon: he trauelled himſelfe night and daie, he maketh a verie fer

                   prayer to God continuallie for the Colloſſians, that they might bee fulfilled with the knowledge of his will, in all wiſdome and ſpirituall vnderſtanding. Colloſ. ver. 9. For this cauſe hee exhorteth the Chriſtians to bee children in malice, but not to bee children in vnderſtanding. The holy Ghoſt doth ſharpely reprooue the Hebrewes as wee may ſee, in the latter end of the 5. chap. of that Epiſtle: becauſe they were yet children to be taught, when for the time they ſhoulde haue been teachers. Againe there is a notable ſentence in the beginning of the ſeconde chap. of the prouerbs, where a man may playnlie prooue, that none can come to the feare of god, but ſuch as doe earneſtlie endeuour for to knowe God. The wordes be theſe. My ſonne, if thou receiue my wordes, & hide my commaundements with thee, to incline thine eares to wiſdome, and to bow thy heart to vnderſtanding: if thou call for vnderſtanding, and vtter thy voyce for knowledge: if thou ſeeke her as ſiluer, and digge for her as for hidde treaſures: Then ſhalt thou vnderſtande

the feare of the Lorde and finde the knoweledge of God. If a man doe not receiue the woorde and commandementes of God vttered by his Miniſters, if he doe not keepe and lay them vp, if he doe not cry and call vpon God for vnderſtanding, if hee doe not incline his eares & bende his heart thereto, if he doe not ſearche and digge after her as men doe for treaſures: he ſhall not come to the knowledge of the feare of God.

               All men which will pleaſe GOD muſt come thus farre, that can ſaye with the Prophete Dauid in the 119. Pſalme. I haue hidden thy worde in my heart▪ that I might not ſinne againſt thee. Alſo in the ſame place when hee hath asked the queſtion. Wherewithall a younge man ſhall cleanſe his wayes, hee aunſwereth, by taking heede there to according to thy worde: where by it is moſt euident, that all thoſe are vnpure in their waies, and ſinne greeuouſly againſt God, which haue not layde vp his woorde in their heartes, nor cleanſed their wayes by the ſame.
               
                  But let vs come to ſome other of your ſayings, which I am greeued for to heare.

               I can not but bee greeued to ſee your groſſe and palpable blindneſſe: and I am the more greeued when I remember that many which are otherwiſe verie wiſe men vſe muche your doltiſhe ſayinges, and thinke they ſpeake very wiſely. They ſay what ſhould vnlearned men meddle further then to ſay their ten commaundements, the Lords praier, and the articles of the faith. And you are of the ſame minde.

               Nay if a man ſay them, and doe not vnderſtand them, hee is little the better. I knowe not why I ſhoulde not vnderſtande them, ſo long as God hath giuen mee my fiue wittes: I am no childe, nor I am no foole.

               In deede hee that hath one good wit, is no foole, muche leſſe are you whiche haue fiue: you muſt needes knowe all and

               Zelot.
               I perceiue you are a fre will man, one of thoſe which thinke by naturall vnderſtanding too conceiue the myſteries of GOD: And yee doe in deede vnderſtand ſo much as is ſufficient: not for to ſaue ye, but as S. Paule ſayth Rom. 1. to make ye without excuſe: & ſo to condemne ye. You know ſome ſinnes: and likewiſe ye can tell ſome thinges which are good, but ye can neuer tell any thing which ye haue done that is good.

               I truſt GOD will bée more fauourable then you are: and that hée will not forgette the good déedes which I haue done.

               A very little box I warrant you will holde all your deedes, if ye haue no moe olde deedes then you haue good deedes.

               Now ye ſpeake of coſt: now ye are hit into your right vaine againe, euen where ye would be, to boaſt of thoſe thinges which ye haue not: for none of all thoſe or ſuch like are good in you, becauſe they doe not proceed of faith: for S. Paul ſaith Rom. 14. ver. 23. Whatſoeuer is not of faith is ſinne.

               Faith is by hearing, and hearing by the word Rom. 10. 17. where a man deſpiſeth the worde, there can be no faith: becauſe faith is grounded vpon the worde, and doth not beleeue thinges conttarye vnto the woorde.

               Now ye are in a deepe peece of diuinity, ye thinke this is ſo equall which yee vtter now, that all the Doctors in the world are not able for to controllye. Ye ſay ye do what ye can, more God cannot require at your handes: you meane as if one ſhoulde make this compariſon: a father canne require no more of his child then his ſtrength wil ſerue, a Prince can commaund his ſubiect no impoſſible thing: if a father ſhoulde whippe his childe for not doing that which he is not able, it were crueltie: if a Prince ſhould put a ſubiect to death for not doyng his commaundement in a matter vponſſible, it were tyranny: the father will ſay. My child did his good will I can aske no more: The Prince will ſay he hath done that which a man might, and further I cannot require. Likewiſe you thinke GOD ſhoulde deale ſtraightly with ye, if he ſhoulde condemne ye for breaking the Lawe, which ye are not able to obſerue: & that he cannot looke for more at your handes then he hath made yee

able to perfourme.

Nay there bee many of yee which in all thinges crie God is mercifull, GOD is mercifull, which neuer conſider with what conditions GOD hath promiſed mercy, neyther how it may ſtand with his iuſtice and trueth: ye thinke GOD offereth mercy without exception.

But let vs come backe againe to the former matter to ſee howe well yee vnderſtand your x commaundements.

The Scripture ſaith, that a ſorowfull ſpirite is a ſacrifice to God: and that God doeth not deſpiſe the humble and contrite heart: But men are afraide to be brought to the knoweledge and feeling of their ſinnes for feare as they ſay, leaſt they ſhoulde be driuen into diſpaire: as though that were a ſafe protection for them for a time to▪ be in a ſenſeleſſe ſecuritie: and as though they were in the better caſe, becauſe they make no conſcience of their ſinnes. Whereas indeede thoſe whiche are pricked and wounded with their ſinnes, are in the way to repentance, when the other are farre off.

               Zelot.
               There is nothing good in men, vnleſſe they beleeue well: and wee can not truſte too muche vnto ſayth: but you doe not vnderſtande what faith is. Tell

me this, doth faith beleeue according as God ſetteth downe, and ſpeaketh in his worde, or doth it beleeue contrary to that which God vttereth?
            
            
               Ath.
               It doeth not beleeue contrarye too that which God vttereth.
            
            
               Zelot.
               Let vs ſee then, when God ſetteth downe and ſheweth which are the works of the fleſh, and threatneth damnation vnto all thoſe which walke in them: when God ſetteth downe that the de

God affirmeth one thing, and yet they beleeue the contrary: but ſee the blindneſſe of men now a dayes, when they heare vaine and brutiſh men boaſt of their faith, yee doe well ſay they, to haue a good beliefe, when as in deede it is no more but a proud preſumption, wherewith God is highly diſpleaſed, becauſe by it they woulde make him a Lyar. When the ſonne of man commeth, ſhall he finde fayth in earth? If this be faith, he ſhall finde great plentie of it euery where. For the Idolater, the ſwearer, the

drunkard, the proude, the Adulterer, are as full of faith as they can be thruſt. For euery one of theſe doeth bragge that hee hath as good a faith to God as he whiche is the moſt holy of all.

               Ath.
               They did commit idolatrie, and the booke ſaith they were deſtroyed, a great number of them.
            
            
               Zelot.
               What? was their intent to worſhip any beſides the true God?
            
            
               Ath.
               That it was, for they deſired Aaron for to make them Gods.
            
            
               Zelot.
               What thinke ye they tooke Aaron for to be, a man, or a God?

               Zelot.
               Did they thinke that Aaron being but a man had power for to make a God?

               Zelot.
               And if you thinke they thought ſo, ye ſhall prooue no great wiſe man. For which way can a man perſwade any, that a man can make a God? Or could they become more brutiſhe then a calfe, for to beleeue that the car

and that which ſhould repreſent God, and put them in minde of him ye muſt not think they were ſo fooliſh, although they were very fooliſh as the holy Ghoſt in one pſal. chargeth them, that they turned their glory into the ſimilitude of a calfe whiche eateth hay: This then is plaine enough, that they, meant not for to worſhip the golden calfe it ſelfe, but God in the Calfe. Let vs ſee then, did they meane for to worſhip any other by the calfe, beſides the true God?

               Now ye are light vpon a very poore ſhift: for we may as well ſay: This is thy God O Iſrael, or make vs a God to go before vs. For the Scripture it ſelfe, in the Hebrew tongue, although it teach that there is but one God, yet ſpeaketh of him in the plural number, and ſaith Gods, for excellencie or dignities ſake, as we ſee Princes here in the world when any of them ſpeaketh, he doth not ſay, I, but we, not my perſon, but our perſon.

               It is eaſie to be proued, both by the words of the people themſelues, when they ſay, theſe be thy Gods O Iſrael, which brought thee out of the lande of Egypt: they meant not to change their GOD which brought them out from Pharao, and ledde them through the red Sea: neither did they thinke that the calfe which Aaron hadd made, was he which deuided the Sea, and drowned Pharao with his hoſt, but they tooke it for an image of that God, and not of any feyned God, and alſo by the woordes of Aaron, when he ſayth. To morrowe ſhalbe a feaſt to Iehouah, which name was neuer giuen to any, but to the God of heauen, at the leaſt in thoſe dayes, the God of Iſrael had that name peculier vnto himſelfe. Then ye may ſee, they worſhipped not the Idole it ſelfe, but God in the Idol, they meant not to woorſhip any falſe God, but the God of heauen, which had deliuered them, & yet they did commit foule Idolatry and fell from God, in ſo much that God was exceeding wrath with them. Likewiſe in popery ye fell from God when ye bowed vnto images.

               Thē your meaning is, that you kept your heart and conſcience to God, and went with your body but for faſhion?

               Then you thinke God requireth not to be woorſhipped but with your ſoule, & that you may ſerue the Diuell with your body. Ye thinke alſo that God doth not require the outwarde confeſſion of the mouth, although it ſhoulde be with loſſe of life.

But I knowe there be many trimme wiſe heades, which excuſe the matter & cleere themſelues this way, that they make no deuotion of the image, or any other thing in the ſeruice of

               It is a meruellous thing for to ſee, how the Diuell doth dazle mens eies, and howe he doth bewitch them. Theſe thinges which you vtter, and ſuche like, are euen like a vaile before your eyes, ſo that yee are not able for to haue any ſight into Gods woorde. Howe groſſe and doltiſhe ſoeuer the matter bee, if yee can ſay thus, our forefathers did it, will ye condemne thē, then all is ſafe enough. But ſee howe yee are ouer ſeene, all our forefathers did not fall from God by idolatrie, for euen in the pride of the reigne of Antichriſt, there were ſome ſtood vp againſt him, in diuers countreis. There were alwaies ſome whō God lightened to ſee the abhominatiōs of the man of ſin, & ſo to repent & take hold of Chriſt: & God who is alwaies like himſelfe receiued them to mercie. And doubtles God is more now diſpleaſed with ſuch as do now wilfully kicke and ſpurne againſt the trueth, and ſeeke for to quench the glorious light of the Goſpel, then he was with thē, from whō the word of God was taken away, and being blinde, they were made for to beleeue euery lye, and therefore nowe when God offereth his grace, and ſeeketh by his worde to expell that groſſe darkenes, it were good for ſuch as you, not to ſtande in your owne

light, and obſtinatelie to refuſe the knowledge of GOD. Our forefathers had that great plague came vpon them, which S. Paul did foretell. 2. Theſe. 2. Namely, that there ſhoulde bee a falling away, that Antichriſt ſhoulde deceaue the worlde, and bring them to damnation: for GOD (he ſaith) ſhould ſende them ſtrong deluſion, euen for to beleeue lies, becauſe they receaued not the loue of the trueth, that they might be ſaued: and now when God offereth his worde agayne, men do not ioyfully and thankfully embrace it, and therefore God doth ſende them ſhepheards euen after their heartes deſire: not to feede them (for they cannot) but to fleeſe thē for that they can skill off: not to bee ſalt for to ſeaſon them, but to bee euen like doung caſt vppon them for to corrupt them: not to giue them light, ſeeing themſelues are blind. The greateſt number of you are as farre from God, as they were euen in the blindeſt time of Poperie, and that is confeſſed by your owne mouth, when ye ſay yee woulde follow our forefathers: For ye meane not thoſe Forefathers which did know and woorſhipp God aright, but thoſe which were ſeduced, and fell from him by Idolatrie. I am verie loth for to queſtion with yee any further in

the commandementes, yee are ſo exceeding blinde in them. For I knowe that in our land, let all the people be numbred, and fiue parts of yee doe vnderſtand ſo much in the commaundements, Lords prayer, and articles of the fayth, that it were a greate ſhame for a godlie man to haue a childe of x. yeeres olde for to knowe no more.

This I finde that in the beſt and moſt religious townes generallie, the greateſt part haue verie little zeale. This I find, that where there is one of theſe townes which are forwarde, there bee fiue which are not, becauſe they want teaching. This further I knowe by experience, that thoſe which are the willing ones, and as it were the daylie hearers for a long time are verie raw when they bee examined. Thē iudg you what is in the reſt, which are verie ſeldome taught, or refuſe for to bee taught. And if this be not true, let mee looſe my hand. And yet there be idle bellies, which are not aſhamed with open mouth to crie

that leſſe preaching woulde ſerue, and that there is knowledge enough among the people: when the poore people doe not vnderſtande ſo much as the Lordes prayer: vnleſſe they would holde them ſtill in poperie, they can be no more ignorant.

But that man which hath ſo little loue to the word, that he cannot beſtow one houre in a weeke for to heare it, and yet can beſtowe diuers houres in vayne talking, drinking and gaming, is but a dull ſcholler vpon the Sabboth day: I warrant yee, if a man looke well vnto him, he ſhall finde it harde to iudge whether he or the ſeat he ſat on, carried away moſt: & for leauing their buſines ſo far as they may conueniently, woulde yee haue them forget the precept of our ſauiour chriſt, firſt ſeeke the kingdom of God, & his righteouſnes, & then al theſe things ſhalbe caſt vpō

They are taught by the word preached, to follow their labours painfully, and the bleſſing of God is vpon mens labours, which doe ſeeke him and the knowledge of his woorde: and although it ſometime doth hinder them one houre, yet it ſaueth them and gayneth them many houres, which they were wont to beſtowe vainely.

               You ſay they goe to ſéeke foode for their ſoules, and to learne for to know God: but they doe it of vaine glorie.
            
            
               
               Zelot.
               There be alwaies ſome no doubt, which doe not ſeeke of a ſyncere minde but of vaine glorie, and doe abuſe their knoweledge, and are vainelie puffed vp in themſelues, with an opinion of thoſe things which are not in them: but will you giue ſentence againſt all, becauſe ſome are ſuch: Is this a good argument? men giue almes for vaine glorie, men come to the Church, and pray of vaine glorie: Therefore almes and prayer are to be left: for doubtleſſe ſome doe thoſe thinges for vaine glorie, euen as our Sauiour Chriſte accuſeth the Scribes and Phariſees.

               But Chriſt biddeth vs doe thoſe thinges. Nowe will yee prooue that we are commanded to doe this.
            
            
               Zelot.
               I knowe no place which hath in plaine woordes, Goe vnto other countreis or townes for to heare preaching, and whie: becauſe the will of God is that they ſhoulde haue preachers come home vnto them, and be appointed ouer them for to feede them. I might alleadge examples of good men which ſought after Chriſt, whome he did not forbid. Doe ye thinke when the Lorde commaundeth vs to ſeeke him ſo earneſtlie, and that in the myſterie of his Goſpell, that a few

miles ought for to ſtop vs. Howe farre thinke yee men runne for a little earthly ſubſtaunce? Howe far doe they run on heapes, both men & women, vnto feaſts, maygames, dauncings, plaies, bearebatings, and other ſuch vanities?

               Youth will be doing, ye muſt not blame them, they haue time enough to bee holy hereafter. I haue had as greate delight my ſelf ere nowe in thoſe things as one, but nowe I waxe olde.
            
            
               Zelot.
               I was ſure yee woulde allowe this kinde of running from towne to towne, this is no diſorder at all: howe many are there of yee, which crie out with open mouth, againſt ſuch as ſeeke after the woorde, and ſeeke for to trouble & puniſh them for ſo doing, which once open your mouth againſt theſe foule abuſes? Whereas ye ſay, youth will be doyng, ye ſay true, and ſo will many aged likewiſe, but doth it followe therefore that they muſt be ſuffered to do the thinges which are euill? In that yee ſay, they haue time enough to bee holy hereafter, therein you ſhewe yourſelfe to be a right worldling, a very epicure, an ignorant man: for thus your worldly Epicures doe ſpeake, youth will haue their race, let them alone, what ſhoulde young men and maidens doe with the ſcriptures? cleane contrarie

vnto that which God ſpeaketh by his Prophete. Wherewithall ſhall a young man clenſe his way? euen by taking heede thereto according to thy woorde. Likewiſe by Salomon in the booke of Eccleſiaſtes chap. 11. Remember thy creator in the dayes of thy youth. But now a daies it is a principal point of diuinitie, that youth may walke after the luſtes of the fleſhe, ſo long vntill through cuſtome of ſinning, they are ſo beſotted and hardened in their wicked luſts, & their concupiſcences are growen ſo ſtrong, that there can no grace enter into them, & ſo it ſeemeth for to be with you, for I dare warrant, you are able to tell a long tale of your youth trickes.
            
            
               Ath.
               Well, I am as I am, you cannot make me better, & I truſt ye ſhall make mee no woorſe. Ye ſpeake as though none coulde be good but ſcripture men.
            
            
               Zelot.
               None can be good but ſuch as feare God, ſuch as ſeeke for to obey him: None feare God, which ſet light by his ordinaunces and caſt them behinde their backes: None can obey GOD, but ſuche as doe ſeeke for to knowe and followe thoſe preceptes which hee vttereth in his woorde. None are godlie, but ſuch as are clenſed, and guide their wayes by the woorde. Hee whiche is

of God heareth Gods worde.
            
            
               Ath.
               If they be ſo good and godlie, howe commeth it to paſſe then, that there is ſo much debate among them? for I knowe townes my ſelfe, whiche are euen deuided one part againſt another, ſince they had a preacher, which were not ſo before. This they gaine, that whereas before they loued together, nowe there is diſſention ſowne among them.
            
            
               Zelot.
               Nowe ye diſcharge your greateſt ordinance: I trowe yee haue nowe paide it home: It is harde if Satan cannot with this engine ouerthrowe and beate downe Preaching. But I pray you tell mee, can yee put fire and water together but they will rumble? Will yee haue light and darkeneſſe for to agree as companions together?
            
            
               Ath.
               What is this to the matter?
            
            
               Zelot.
               Woulde yee haue God and the Diuell agree together? woulde ye haue the godlie and the wicked for to bee at one? this ye muſt do, ye looke where the fault is to bee laide.
            
            
               Ath.
               I thinke the fault muſt néedes bee layde vppon the preaching, becauſe they agréed before that came.
            
            
               
               Zelot.
               If their agreement together before had beene good, then no doubt the preaching that ſhould breake it, could not be good: for one good thing cannot deſtroye another. But the former peace was not in GOD, but in the fleſhe: neither was it ſo great as you would ſeeme for to ſet it foorth, becauſe that the worldlinges are alwayes at ſtrife, and one readie for to cut anothers throate: but yet their hatred is ſo exceeding greate againſt the Goſpell, that in reſpect of the mind, which they carrie towards the profeſſors thereof, they ſeeme among themſelues to bee at peace, and one to loue and make much of another.
            
            
               Ath.
               Where is the fault then for to be layde?
            
            
               Zelot.
               Vpon the wicked which fret and rage againſt the word, becauſe it layeth open and diſcloſeth their filthineſſe, and bewrayeth them. For the light (as S. Paule ſaith) doth manifeſt all thinges. They pretend other excuſes, as though they hated the profeſſours for ſome euill conditions: but this is very euident, a blinde man may almoſt diſcerne it, that ſo long as a man is voyd of religion, and maketh profeſſion of no more then they; ſo long, although he be full, and ſwarme with

greate vices, hee is an honeſt man, but let him follow the woorde, and be carefull for to amende, then there is not a lewder fellow vppon earth, diuers flaunders ſhall bee rayſed, thinges ſhall bee reckoned vp, which hee did ſeuen yeeres agone: and now they hate him like a dogge. Light is come into the worlde, and men loue derkeneſſe more then light, becauſe their workes be euill. Will yee charge Chriſte and his Goſpell, becauſe as he ſayeth, hee came not to ſende peace, but a ſwoorde, to ſet the father againſt the ſonne? Math. 10. Or will yee laye the blame vppon thoſe which loue the light? Will yee blame S. Paule and his preaching becauſe there was ſtirre and hurly burly almoſt whereſoeuer he came? Was he to be blamed, or the wicked infidels, which could not abide to haue their ſinnes reproued?
            
            
               Ath.
               There be ſome places where they haue graue and learned preachers, and yet there is no ſuch contention in their pariſhes: I like that wel.

               You like that well: ſo doth your maſter alſo.

               Euen the Diuell, for he is content

thoſe preachers ſhould ryde vppon his backe, becauſe he is ſure they will not ſpure▪ gall him: they be verie gentle riders. Doe ye not thinke, that if they ſhoulde ſet foorth Gods worde as they ought, and ſpreade the light: that all wicked men (of which their pari

                  he are full) would ſtorme and fret againſt them? the Diuell himſelfe woulde fiske about, if they ſhoulde ſpurre him but a little. But they can tell a ſmooth tale in the pulpit, garniſhed with ſome mery ſtory, for to make the people merry, or elſe ſome olde rotten allegorie: or ſome farre fetched matter out of ſome great writers, that the people maye be at their wits ende, and admit them. A mā would thinke to ſee the people come out of the Church blowing, that they were fedde as ful as tickes; when they goe home with emptie bellies. This I dare warrant, if it be not ſo, let me loſe both mine eares, that goe thorow the pariſhes of theſe graue and learned diuines, and except ſuch as runne to fetche their victuals other where, yee ſhall not find fiue among fiueſcore which are able to vnderſtande the neceſſarie groundes and principles of religion: and yet the people will ſay they bee excellent deepe men: But I loue not thoſe▪ Welles whiche are ſo deepe

               I ſée you like better of young raſh heades and troubleſome fellowes, then yee doe of graue ſtayed men: for nowe a dayes there are a number which take vpon them to preach, which in deede do but prattle: and for my part, I wil beléeue none of them: but I wil rather giue credite to that which ancient learned men do ſpeake.

               I do vtterly miſlike, that any raſhe head ſhoulde haue the office of preaching▪ which is a thing of ſo greate dignitie, as to be the mouth of God vnto the people, to vtter the counſels and myſteries of the Lorde, and to teach them the way to ſaluation: and great diſhonour to God and his Goſpell it
                     •
                   is, if there be many ſuch, as you ſay there be: but if they be godly, learned, graue, diſcrete, and wiſe, and doe faithfully and zealouſly▪ diſpoſe the manifolde myſteries of God, thē the matter is not whether they bee young or olde: for the docttine which they doe teache and expound, is not their owne, but the doctrine of Chriſt, the authoritie is not of them, but of GOD which hath giuen it. But I knowe your meaning: you count all thoſe to be ignoraunt, and to prattle, which

               Ath.
               And ſurely I thinke they do much good.
            
            
               Zelot.
               You thinke they do much good: but I know they do very much hurt: the blind and vnlearned Miniſters are hurtfull, thoſe which are popiſh prieſts doe hurt; they which follow euill vices, as drunken miniſters, ſwearers, quarellers, adulterers, gameſters, & ſuche like doe hurt, but yet theſe which you ſpeake of, do more hurt: I will tell you howe, where there is ſuch an one as thoſe aboue named, the people haue no great opiniō of them, for they can▪ eaſily ſay, alas our miniſter is not able nor meete for to teach vs, and ſo they are willing to heare & to be informed by others: but thoſe which haue one of your profounde Clearkes, the people ſo muche hang vppon him, that they will heare none other: This

they ſay, our preacher is as profounde a man as any of thē all: if we were out of the way, he would tell vs, if ſo much 
                     •
                  eaching were needfull, woulde not he teach vs? If ſuch things were euill, would he vſe them? And ſo they conclude, that they care not for learning ought ſauing at his mouth, when as in deede he teacheth them litle or nothing, peraduenture he giueth them a cold collation once a month, and when a man ſhall take the proofe of them, he ſhall finde that they are no better then ſuch as haue a dumbe I doll to their ſhepheard.
            
            
               Ath.
               Is it not better for to haue a ſermon now and then, and to haue it a learned ſermon: then for to haue many without learning? I thinke one ſuch ſermon doeth more good thē an hundreth of thoſe flying ſermons.
            
            
               Zelot.
               I graunt thus much, that the word of God is to be handeled with great care, men are not to ſteppe foorth and to ſpeake raſhly, and without ſure and vndoubted knowledge of the thinges which they vtter.
               Moreouer, there ought to be ſuch learning and diſcretion, as ſhall be ſufficient to open and to manifeſt the power and dignitie of the worde vnto the conſciences of the hearers: he muſt be able for to make plaine

the ſenſe of the ſcriptures, and he muſt apply it to the hearers which doth preach. For to handle the holy myſteries of God vnskilfully is a vice greatly to be condemned, & I thinke ſuch, although they preache neuer ſo often, ſhall doe but litle good. But I pray you let me know which you count a learned ſermon: and which ye call a flying ſermon?
            
            
               Ath.
               That is a learned ſermon, when the Preacher doth lay open the matter learnedly.
            
            
               Zelot.
               You meane when he is able to ſpeake much Latine, and to alleadge all ſorts of writers?

               If ſo little coulde pleaſure you, then no doubt a whole ſermon would edifie yee much. But ſuch vayne men as you.

doe ſhew your vanitie, when ye looke more after thoſe thinges which ſhould feede your eares, then for to haue your ſoules conuerted. Is that to be vſed which cannot edifie at all, but ſerueth for a vaine ſhewe, and diſturbeth the minde and memorie of the diligent hearer? But let this goe, and let vs ſee the other, for alleadging of writers, in this matter yee haue ſundrie graue men of your ſide, which count thoſe Sermons learned, which are ſet foorth with all ſortes of authorities, and thoſe which bring the bare worde out of the Bible, they make but verball Sermons: But doubtleſſe they may ſhewe ſome grauitie in their beard, for there is none in the matter.

They make a great ſhew of learning and yet want the knowledge of the dignitie of gods word. When as they bring in the ſayings of Plato, and Ariſtotle, as fellowes and companions with the oracles of God vttered by his Prophetes

and Apoſtles, and as though there were greater and deeper matter in thoſe, then in the Bible, whereas all the heauenly myſteries and counſels of God are vttered, they ſticke not to count that vnlearned whiche is brought from thence: and greate learning to bee in the ſayinges of the other.

               I know not what I ſhall be able for to make you beleeue, but I am ſure I can plainely ſhewe what yee ought to beleeue. Firſt, marke this, the worde came not from man, neither can a man teache it ye, vnleſſe God reueale it by his ſpirite: if it were the wiſedome of the worlde, or of the fleſh, then the ſpirit of the world which is in man and knoweth the ſecretes of man, could teache it: but becauſe it is the myſterie of GOD, none can make yee learne it, but the holy Ghoſte, which ſearcheth euen the deepe

things of God, as S. Paul teacheth. 1. Cor. 2. 10 S. Iohn in his firſt Epiſtle, Chap. the ſeconde, hauing told them that there were euen then many Antichriſts, he comforteth them with this. You ſaith he, haue receiued an annointing from the holy one, & know all things. Like as therefore none of thoſe can learne, whō God doth not inlighten with his ſpirite: ſo on the cōtrary part all thoſe which are taught within by the ſpirit, doe feele when the doctrine which the ſame ſpirit hath taught, is vttered: he knoweth his owne, and he ſealeth it vp in their hearts and conſciences, which being inſtructed by him, muſt needes conſent thereto fully. For this cauſe there is great difference betweene ſuch as ſet all vpon the authorities of men, and ſuch as preach, as S. Paul ſaith he did with the plaine euidence of the ſpirit, and of power, 1. Cor. 2. 4. he addeth the reaſon in the next verſe, that their faith ſhould not cō
                  ſiſt in the wiſedome of men, but in the power of God. If faith may not hang vpon the wiſdome of men, and therefore the intiſing ſpeech which mans wiſedome teacheth, is to be auoided in ſetting foorth the Goſpell, then can it not ſtand vpon the authorities of men.

               Yes, no doubt there are circumſtances, which may make it ſometime very needfull I ſpeake only againſt this, that they are alleaged when as we may alledge the ſame things out of the worde it ſelfe. And when they are alleadged, for men to builde their faith vpon, or to make men thinke that there can be no certaintie in the interpretation of the worde, but where as they are made for to ſpeake: When as in deed the Preacher in his Sermon muſt come with ſuch euidence and make his proofe ſo plaine and ſo ſtrong, that it muſt needes conuince the conſcience of the hearers, in ſuch wiſe that of neceſſitie he ſhalbe forced for to ſay, vndoubtedly that which this man vttereth, is that which God himſelf ſpeaketh: for ſo ſaith the Apoſt. 1. Cor. 14. 24 If, ſaith he, all doe propheſie, and there come in an infidel, or one vnlearned, he is reproued of all, he is iudged of all: and ſo the ſecrets of his hearte are made manifeſt, and falling vpon his face, he will worſhip God, confesſing that God is verily among you. This teſtimonie doth ſhew that the force of Gods worde vttered nakedly is▪ ſuch, that it conuicteth the hart of the infidel, and cōpelleth him for to confeſſe that God is with thē which ſpeak it.
               
                  The worde of God is deſcribed in the Epiſtle to the Hebrwes Chap. 4. 12. after this ſort: the worde of God (ſaith he) is liuely & mightie in operation, ſharper then any two edged ſworde, and entereth in vnto the deuiding aſunder of the ſoule and the ſpirite, of the ioynts and the marrow, and is a diſcerner of the thoughts and intents of the hart. Men might vnderſtand by this, that by whom ſoeuer this ſword of the ſpirite be drawne forth, if it be rightly handled, it will pearſe through, and through both the bodies and ſoules of the hearers, and will moue euery veine in the heart, euen of the wicked. So that he needeth not for to grind it, or make it ſharpe vpon the grindſtone of Ambroſe or Hierom.

               There is great benefite in the reading of them, for to helpe vs to the true vnderſtanding of the ſcriptures.

               Nowe yee reaſon as buſſardlike as can be, ye may be a Doctour of Dunces, for this argument. Doth the Preacher come in his owne name, muſt he tell his owne will, or is he to ſeeke his owne glorie or the glory of any other man? If other haue holpen him to finde the knowledge of Gods will, which he muſt vtter, it is therefore become theirs, becauſe they haue ſhewed it vnto him: If he now ſet it foorth in the name of the Lord alone, whoſe it is, doth he robbe them? For looke whatſoeuer a man findeth in the auncient writers in expounding, he is no further to beleeue them then they proue their expoſition out of the Bible: ſo that it continueth ſtill not theirs, but the Lordes▪ and if wee ſhoulde aſcribe it vnto them, we ſhould robbe the Lorde, and bee theeues for other men. Therefore in this matter, wee muſt follow the precept which the Lorde giueth. 1, Peter 4. 11. He that ſpeaketh let him ſpeake as the wordes of God.

               Zelot.
               I tolde yee before that it is not ſimply vnlawfull for to cite or alleadge a ſentence out of a Doctour. But the maner and ende of the dooyng of it is all: I ſay likewiſe that a man may in ſome ſorte alleadge a ſaying out of any Heathen or prophane Writer: for wee haue the example of Saint Paule Actes. 17. 1. Corinth. 15. Titus 1. Alleadging the ſayinges of prophane Poets. But wee muſt ſee to what end: doth hee reaſon thus, the Poet ſaith it, therefore are yee to giue credite vnto it: no man woulde bee ſo fooliſhe as to make their wordes being Heathen men, to bee of ſuch authoritie: but he ſheweth that euen their owne Doctors conſented with him in thoſe things. And therefore a ſhame, and foule reproche for them too bee ignorant of the ſame. When the Papiſtes doe charge vs to be gone from the faith of the olde Fathers, although we are to confute them this way, namely, by ſhewing their treacherie and lying, when we are able to prooue by the writinges of the auncient Fathers that in the chiefe pointes they fully agree with vs: yet this is not the way which God hath appointed and ſanctified for the

conuerſion and education of his people: this engine is ouer weake to reare vp the Temple of the Lorde: we muſt take heede we leaue not the mightie worde it ſelfe, and leane vnto a tottering piller: Saint Paule ſheweth the power of the worde. 2. Corinth. 10. where hee ſaith, although we walke in the fleſhe, yet wee warre not after the fleſhe: for the weapons of our warrefare are not carnall, but mightie in God for to throwe downe holdes: which he expoundeth in the verſe which followeth, to be the imaginations and euery high thing which is exalted againſt the knowledge of God, and euery thought, which (hee ſaith) they leade captiue vnto the obedience of Chriſt. There is no power nor anye authoritie can doe theſe thinges, but that which is in the word of God it ſelfe. Which is to be made ſo euident by the Preacher, that it may bring this thing to paſſe.
               The miſerable experience in our time of ſuche as flie from the ſtrong power of the woorde, and fight with the weapons of menne, maye reache vs, becauſe it doeth manifeſtly appeare vnto all whiche haue eyes too ſee, that they are not

ſtrong enough to throwe downe holdes, and to leade captiue vnto the obedience of Chriſt the rebellious thoughtes and imaginations of mens mindes: they cannot ſhew a man by them conuerted ſincerely & throughly from errours and euill maners: by alleadging the authorities of men. It was not the practiſe of the auncient and godly fathers in their Sermons for to leaue the teſtimonies of the mightie word, which is able to rent the ſtony rocke in peeces, and to cleaue to the authorities of weake men, which were gone before them. But what ſhould a man ſay? The worde is thought to bee of no power vnleſſe it bee ſtrengthened otherwiſe.
               But let vs leaue this and come backe againe to ſome of your other matters. I remember ye did lay this as a great accuſation againſt the preachers that they medled with predeſtination.

Chapter I. 4. theſe are his wordes, as he hath choſen vs in him, before the foundations of the worlde were layde, that wee ſhoulde bee holy and without blame before him through loue. Howe ſtand theſe two thinges together, when you ſay if men be choſen they may liue as they luſt, and God ſayth by his Apoſtle, that hee hath choſen them for to bee holy and blameleſſe in their conuerſation. And this is vndoubtedly true, that thoſe whom God hath predeſtinate to bee heires of glory, hee hath ſealed them with the holy Spirite, as yee maye reade in the ſame Chapter. They are freed from the bondage of ſinne by the ſpirite, they walke in the ſpirite, they are led by the ſpirite, they ſhewe forth by the fruites of the ſpirite, that the fleſh with the luſtes and concupiſcences thereof is crucified in them, and that they are regenerate and 
                     〈…〉
                   againe of the ſpirite, and ſo become newe creatures in Chriſt, ſinne is abhominable vnto them, they hate & loth it no leſſe then deadlie poiſon, they pant and breath to

be wholy ſet free from the remnantes of it. Righteouſneſſe is deare and precious vnto them, their ioye and heartes delight is in it. They ſigh and grone, becauſe they can not reache vnto the perfection of it. The word of God doth plainely teach, that the electe are thus as I haue ſhewed: and yet men ſay that election taketh away all care of Godlye life.
            
            
               Ath.
               I like not this, that men will ſaye, they know God hath choſen them: howe can they tell? Can any man tell what God will doe with him? Did God euer tell them, that they are elected:
            
            
               Zelot.
               Howe ſhoulde you like of this, when as yee like of no goodneſſe? Howe ſhoulde you which are but a naturall man, iudge of thinges ſpirituall? You thinke a man can not tell what GOD will do with him: becauſe you are blinde and ſee not the way: ye ſuppoſe all other are ſo: you are an Infidell, or els ye might plainly heare GOD ſpeake in his woord, and tell which ſhall be ſaued, and which are in the way to damnation. Doe ye ſuppoſe that it is vncertayne when the ſcripture telleth a man howe he ſhall knowe that he is choſen, if the woorde

of God tell him he is choſen, hath not God himſelfe then tolde him? Read the firſt Chapter of the ſeconde Epiſtle of Peter, and there yee ſhall ſee how a man ſhall knowe certainely that he is elected, and that hee ſhall neuer fall. For if a man feele that GOD teacheth him by his ſpirite, and reneweth him by repentaunce, he is ſure (becauſe God ſayth ſo) that he is choſen to eternall life: if at any time hee feele the grace of GOD weake in him, then doeth hee doubt and ſtagger, but yet his fayth getteth the vpper hande. On the other ſide, when a man liueth in ſinne, and obeyeth vnrighteouſneſſe: God telleth him plainely that he is in the way to damnation. And therefore all thoſe which do not finde in them ſelues the ſpirituall birth at the leaſt begunne whereby they may aſſure them ſelues that they be choſen: May certainly ſay, that as yet their ſtate is damnable.
            
            
               Ath.
               Howe can yee ſaye their ſtate is damnable, ſo long as they beléeue? Can men do more then beléeue?
            
            
               Zelot.
               They doe not beleeue: for if they beleeue, then are they ſure that GOD loueth them, what is it elſe which they beleeue? if they knowe they bee in fauour with God, it is becauſe he choſe them in Chriſt.

If they doubt of Gods fauour then doe they doubt whether God heareth their prayers, & therefore they ſhall not receyue any thing at the handes of GOD, as ye may learne in the Epiſtle of Saint Iames. Chapter 1. verſe 6, 7. and although manie of the faithfull doe doubt & ſtagger oftentimes, yet they are not like the vnfaithful which cōtinue in the ſame, but they get the vpper hande, they ſtriue by prayer, & by al other meanes which god hath appointed, to ſtrengthen and increaſe their faith, their knowledge, their repentance, and ſo farre to growe in grace, vntill they come to aſſurance that God hath choſen them. As for the wicked they know of no ſuch faith, that a man may atraine to aſſurance of his election: they labour not about anie ſuch matter, but continue ſtill in their blinde doubtes, ſetting all vpon hazzard: and as for their doing what they can, it is nothing, they cannot but ſinne, and therefore be damned, howeſoeuer they ſeeme for to do good workes, yet before God they are no good workes, becauſe they proceede not of faith, but from the fleſh▪ they are not grafted into the true vine, Chriſt, and for that cauſe can bring forth no fruite.

               You are like vnto a man whiche doeth make ſtrife and debate betweene brethren and friendes: you woulde ſet prayer and teaching, and the death of Chriſt, together by the eares with Gods election: but doe what yee can, all theſe will agree well together, they bee ſo vnſeparably knit in friendſhip. God hath choſen men for to be redeemed in his ſonne. For the ſcripture ſheweth that we are choſen in Chriſt. He hath choſen men to bee inſtructed and called by preaching the woord, he hath choſen men for to call vpon him and to worſhip him, in holynes and righteouſnes, all the dayes of their life.

               Ye ſpeake much of preaching, preaching as though it were ſo needful: Can they make the worde of God better then it is? Is there not enough ſet downe in the Bible for men to reade, wherefore ſhoulde they adde more? Can not men reade that? Is not reading preaching?

But wee muſt not leaue yee thus but bring yee into the way againe. Preaching is not ſo needefull, they can make the worde of God no better then it is: why man they doe not preache for to make the worde better, but for to make you better. There is enough ſet downe in the Bible, but you vnderſtand little enough of it. Men may reade it, as a great number doe which peruert it, and are nothing bettered by it, becauſe they ſeeke not helpe for to vnderſtande it. Reading ſay you is preaching. Truly then I knowe a man which hath a little daughter that is a trimme Preacher. I perceiue our lande is full of Preachers: but yet in deede not ſuch as Saint Paule deſcribeth. For the little girle is not apt to teach, able to inſtruct, to exhort, to conuince, not to deuide or cut the worde of God aright, nor to open the Myſteries of it. If yee leape ouer many of

theſe ditches, yee will breake your necke in the ende: ye are a very skilfull man, when yee take expounding and applying the worde of God, for to be adding: for ye aske why they ſhould adde.

               Where learne ye that prayer in the ſcripture? The Prophet Dauid, Pſalme 19. Prayeth to be cleanſed from his ſecrete ſinnes, although they bee neuer ſo ſmall. Where learned ye to ſpeake after this ſorte, no woorſe, and that yee hope then to doe well enough: Is it nothing to breake ſo ſtraight a rule of Chriſt? Doe yee not thinke that children dying in their infancie, before they can ſpeake or woorke are damned for leſſe ſins. I ſpeake of ſuch as are not of Gods Church. When as they haue onely originall ſin▪ You know not from how euil a roote this

                  inne doth ſpring: neither doee ye know the

fouleneſſe of ſinne, and therefore ye cannot tell how much God doth abhorre it, & condemne it. For this cauſe, being as full of filthy vices and prophane ſinnes as ye cā be thruſt, and of ſuch in deede as God doth curſe and hate: becauſe they ſeeme ſmall vnto you, ye ſuppoſe ye ſhal do wel ynough. What if I haue greater in me or that I ſhall cōmit greater as you ſay before the weeke be ended, doth that excuſe you? I haue many ſecret ſinnes in me, which I do not ſee becauſe I do not perfectly vnderſtād the law of God: for theſe I doe earneſtly intreat the Lord to make them knowne vnto me, by giuing me more perfect vnderſtanding of his will, and alſo to giue me power for to caſt them out. I haue alſo many ſinnes in mee which I ſee and knowe, that cleane ſo faſt, that I cannot vtterly caſt them foorth: notwithſtanding I hate and abhorre them, I am wearie of them, I fight againſt them, I grone and ſigh in my heart with ſorowe for them, I feele no ſweetneſſe in them: for they are more bitter then Gall vnto my ſoule. I am exceeding glad when I can ſuppreſſe them, I haue profeſſed and vowed a continuall warre againſt them, and although I preuaile not ſo farre as to bee vtterly ridde

of them, yet I labour by meditation in gods worde, and by heartie prayer, to bring them vnder, that they raigne not ouer me, nor that I may not agree with them: and although I be not able to become perfect, yet with al the might I can, I ſtraine and breath to come as nigh perfection as I can: my deſire is good to reach it, and although I find that I come many degrees ſhort, yet I approche nearer and nearer. This is true repentance, this is that which S. Paule ſetteth forth in himſelfe. Rom. 7. Philip. 3. With this I know God is pleaſed▪ without this there cānot be any ſeruice done to God.

               Our Sauiour Chriſte doeth not forbid to eſpie a mote in an other mans eye, for we are commaunded to admoniſh one an other, what ſoeuer it bee wherein we doe amiſſe: but ſuch as you, which can not abyde to be admoniſhed, doe euer alleadge that ſaying of Chriſte, as though hee had ſpoken it vnto this ende, that one ſhould not admoniſh an other. It is a

                  oule hypocriſie for a man to be curious in reproouing ſmall faultes in other, and make

no conſcience of great and foule vices in him ſelfe. Euerie man ought to looke vnto himſelfe, and euery man is bound by the woorde of God, and charitie, to looke vnto others, and to conuert them from their ſinnes if they can. To conuert a ſinner from going aſtray, and to ſaue a ſoule from death. As S. Iames ſpeaketh. Chap. 5. verſ. 20. And ſo to couer a multitude of ſinnes, is a bleſſed thing, and ought, to moue men with diligence to vſe charitable admonition.

               Let a man ſee yee commit any foule crime, and reproue yee, your aunſwere is by and by, yee may not iudge: when as the matter is plaine and doth iudge it ſelfe: Now when a man doth admoniſhe you, according as God commaundeth, yee are bolde with the ſame mouth, which ſaide, ye ought not to iudge, for to iudge him, affirming that he doth it of a captious and quarrelling minde: the thing being ſo exceeding good of it ſelfe: who made you able for to ſee into the heart of a man, and

to find that he doth it not well. You are thoſe of whom the Prophet ſpeaketh, Woe be vnto thoſe which call good euill, and euill good, If he be a man ſpotted with vices himſelfe, & doth reprooue another, not caring for to amende, ye may boldly ſay he doth it of an euill minde: for can he be charitable vnto other men, to ſeeke their conuerſion, and not to bee charitable vnto himſelfe to ſeeke his owne ſaluation: Or can he hate vngodlineſſe in other, and not hate it in himſelfe?
            
            
               Ath.
               Well, the beſt of vs all may bee amended, wée haue all infirmittes: what would yée haue more then this, at the laſt for to call for mercy: If a man be ſorie and aſke God forgiuenes, is hée not euen as well as they which are the moſt preciſe: the mercie of GOD muſt ſaue all: and what would yée haue a man care for more then to bée ſaued: I praye God I may haue time to repent in the ende.

               Here is good ſtuffe, here is ſound diuinitie: I may well terme this reaſon euen the porter of hell, for it openeth euen the wideſt▪ gate, that a thouſande may goe in on a ranke.
               This is true, that the beſt of vs all may be

amended, and that we haue all infirmities: but yee doe wickedly applye it, for when yee ſhould reaſon thus, the beſt may be ameded, the moſt holy are ſpotted, and therefore as Saint Paule doth teach, they muſt indeuour for to proceede forwarde: for the woorde of God willeth men to ſtriue and contend euen againſt all vncleaneſſe, and neuer to ceaſe, but to come as nigh perfection as is poſſible. But you reaſon quite contrary, that becauſe the beſt are ſinners, therefore men are to make ſmall account to amende. Ye ſhould think thus, the moſt godly haue neede to ſorrowe and mourne, and proceede in repentaunce, therefore howe much neede, haue ſuche as are groſſe ſinners. For our Sauiour Chriſt doth ſhew, Iohn 8. That whoſoeuer committeth ſinne, is the ſeruaunt of ſinne: Nowe ſo long as a man is the ſeruaunt of ſinne, ſo long is hee not the ſeruant of God, for no man can ſerue two ſo contrary maſters. Saint Iohn ſayeth, he that committeth ſinne, is of the Diuell. Where learned yee this, that a man may continue in his vices all his life, and at the laſt call for mercy? God commaundeth men to repent ſpeedely, and not to put of from day to day? Hee

threatneth exceeding ſharpely, in the firſt Chapter of the Prouerbs, that when hee hath called and cryed vnto men for to returne from their euill waies, and they haue refuſed, that at the laſt, they ſhall call and not be hearde: hee will laugh when their deſtruction commeth vppon them: they ſhall ſeeke him, but not finde him. Doe you thinke that when God hath called and wee refuſe, that we ſhall not call and he refuſe?
            
            
               Ath.
               The ſcripture ſayth, that what time ſoeuer a ſinner doth repente him of his ſinne, God will forgiue him.
               
                  Zelot. If the ſcripture ſpeake any thing to the comfort of the ſorowfull heart, the Deuill doth teache the impenitent for to abuſe it to their hardening. It is moſt true that at what time ſoeuer a ſinner doth repent, his ſinnes are all forgiuen, but is it in a mans choiſe for to repent when hee will, can hee take a newe heart when it doth pleaſe him can he haue the newe birth, and a ryght ſpirite when he will? It is God which doth create a man a new, or maketh him a new creature in Chriſt, when it pleaſeth him. A man needeth, not for to care for any thing but to be ſaued, but that is not ſo eaſie a

matter as men thinke. Striue for to enter in at the ſtraight gate (ſayth Chriſt) for manye ſhall ſtriue and ſhall not enter. The waie is narowe and the gate is ſtraight whiche leadeth vnto life, and fewe there bee which find it: and if this be true whiche you ſay, that a man may liue in ſinne all his life, and at the laſt be ſaued euen for vtteling a fewe wordes: Then the way is broad and eaſie, who cannot finde it, who almoſt doeth not walke in it▪ But alas, it is a broken ſtaffe whiche men doe leane vnto. God is verie mercifull, but not to thoſe which deſpiſe his Goſpell, for vengeance belongeth vnto ſuch: it is vnpoſſible (ſayth the holy Ghoſt. Hebr. 2.) that ſuche ſhoulde eſcape. And although ye haue neuer ſo long time to repent, if God doe not worke it in yee, you ſhall die in that blindneſſe and hardneſſe of heart in whiche yee haue liued: wee muſt ſeeke in our life time to bee begotten by the worde: for the ſcripture ſaith God doth beget his children by that.

               Marke what repentance is: and try whether yee can repent nowe, it ye cannot, what moueth yee to thinke that yee ſhalt be able then?

               Zelot.
               Repentance is a returning home vnto God from all euill vices and corrupte deſires which are in the fleſh and in the heart. To be renued by repentaunce, cannot be but where a man is renued in knowledge, for that is one part of the image of GOD which muſt be reſtored in vs: Reade in the 4. Chapter to the Ephe. from the 17. verſe forwarde. If a man continue in darkeneſſe, he doth not repent: He which committeth his foule ſinns ſtill, although it bee but in the deſire of his heart, hath not repented. He which doth not feele ſorrowe and griefe, and hath not a broken and contrite heart, and a ſorowfull ſpirite, hath not repented: hee which doth not eſchue euill and doe good, hath not repented: All theſe are taught by the worde, for that is it by whiche wee muſt clenſe, our wayes: and therefore yee may boldly ſay, that he which learneth not out of Gods woorde to repent, cannot repent: for although if it were poſſible hee coulde repent for all other ſinnes, yet this one ſinne, to ſet light by the inſtruction of the Goſpell, will make ſtill worſe then they of Sodome, as our Sauiour doth tell vs▪ Math. 11.

               Zelot.
               Wee may not pronounce vppon any one man, becauſe GOD onely ſeeth what is in man. But yet wee may boldely goe ſo farre as the worde of God doeth leade vs: and by it wee may ſee what GOD requireth and what God doeth condemne. We may ſee that the common and generall repentaunce which all profeſſe at their ende is not ſo muche as a ſhadowe of true repentaunce: repentance cannot be in a man, eſpecially vppon a ſodaine, but he muſt needes feele a wonderfull chaunge in hym ſelfe: he muſt needes bee able for to ſay I haue repented, I knowe and feele that I am a newe man, and therefore becauſe I knowe moſt certainely that there is repentaunce in mee, I knowe moſt certainely that I ſhall be ſaued: for GOD promiſeth ſaluation vnto euerye one whiche doeth repent. In the common repentance men feele no ſuch thing: But are ſtil (as they may be well enough) in doubt of ſaluation.
            
            
               Ath.
               Shall not all ſuch as call vppon God be heard? ſurely I dare not but thinke they ſhall.
            
            
               
               Zelot.
               I am ſure becauſe the Lorde doth ſpeake it. That whoſoeuer doth call vppon him ſhall bee ſaued. But yet yee muſt put this in, that then they muſt pray in fayth, as for the prayers of a wicked man which doth not repent, and therefore hath not the true faith they are no prayers before GOD, although hee crie lowde, or call neuer ſo often: for vnto ſuch the Lorde ſpeaketh in the firſt Chapter of the Prophete Iſaiath, When yee ſtretch forth your handes, I will turne away mine eyes from yee. Alſo if yee multiplie your prayer I will not heare. Likewiſe the holy Ghoſt ſaieth by Solomon in the Prouerbes that the ſacrifice of the wicked is an abhomination. And in the ſame booke it is ſaid. He that turneth away his eare from hearing the lawe, euen his prayer ſhall bee abhominable, and therefore in the latter ende of the fourth Chapter of Eccleſiaſtes, he aduiſeth men when they come into the houſe of GOD, to take heed to their fe

for ſo ſoone as the proſper againe, yee ſhall ſee them returne to their olde by as: if they had truely repented, then ſhoulde it euer continue with them, manie that liue in malice, ſo ſoone as they be daungerouſly ſicke, will be readie to aske forgiueneſſe, and to forgiue all the worlde. They knowe it booteth not to beare malice anie longer, but ſo long as they be able to craulle out of their bedde, and to ſtande vppon their legges, yee ſhall ſee their olde withered malice (as it ſeemed) ſpring a freſh againe, which is a ſtrong proofe, that they neuer truely repented, howſoeuer they thought they did. And euen ſo is it in all other ſinnes, they ſeeme vnto men for to repent, they aske▪ GOD forgiueneſſe, but yet the hearte abideth ſtill the ſame that it was before God: there is no chaunge in them before God: they haue not put of the ſinnefull bodie of the fleſhe: there is no chaunge in them before God: howeſoeuer they ſeeme to be chaunged before men. This counterfet repentance maketh men bolde all their life to deſpiſe the holy worde of God, which ſhoulde inſtruct and guide them: it cauſeth them at their ende not to feare the wrath of God, no

               What difference can you ſhewe betweene thoſe whiche are taught as you woulde haue them and ſuch as haue knowledge, they can no more but repent, call for mercie, and beleeue? And this doe they aſwell as the other.
            
            
               Zelot.
               You thinke there is no difference, but there is this difference, that the one part doeth beleeue and repent in deede, and the other but in woord: as our Sauiour Chriſt Matth. 15. alleadgeth the ſaying of God by his Prophete. This people drawe neere mee with their mouth, and honour me with their lippes, but their heart is farre from mee.
            
            
               Ath.
               That is meant when a man doth ſpeake with his mouth, and meaneth not with his heart, but theſe haue a good meaning in their minde.
            
            
               Zelot.
               It is meant when a man approcheth

with his mouth, and hath ſtill a wicked heart, and an euill conſcience, for thoſe do remooue a man ſo farre from God, that no blind intent can make him neere vnto him. God looketh for great things in the heartes of thoſe which call vpon him.
            
            
               Ath.
               I thinke God accepteth the prayer of the honeſt poore man as well as of any other, and will heare him as ſoone, as hee will heare the prayer of thoſe which knowe moſt, and are the beſt learned.
            
            
               Zelot.
               God is no accepter of perſons, hee heareth the poore as well as the riche, the vnlearned as well as the learned, ſo that their prayers bee made aright. But if yee ſpeake of thoſe honeſt men which are ſo called, & yet are voide of all knowledge of Gods woorde, and of religion, it is an eaſie matter for to prooue that their prayers are not good.
            
            
               Ath.
               Can yee haue anye better prayer then the Lordes prayer, when they praye that, can ye require more?
            
            
               Zelot.
               There can be no better prayer then the Lordes prayer, and he which prayeth that right muſt needes bee ſaued. But let mee aske you this queſtion, what if a man pray the Lordes prayer with his mouth

and regardeth it not in his heart, ſhal his praier be good?
            
            
               Ath.
               His prayer cannot be good, he doth but mocke God.
            
            
               Zelot.
               Then tell me this, a man prayeth thus, hallowed be thy name, in worde he ſeemeth to deſire that the name of God may be ſanctified and honoured: he goeth his way, and blaſphemeth the name of GOD, or heareth it blaſphemed and neuer careth, rayleth vpon his worde, diſhonoureth him, doe yee not thinke that hee made a ſweete preyer? In the like maner he ſaith, thy will bee done in earth as it is in heauen, he goeth away and is ſo farre from deſiring to do the will of God, that hee neuer careth for to knowe it. Whereby it is euident that he little ment with his heart that which he ſaid with his tongue.
               Moreouer, hee would ſeeme in woordes to craue of God, that hee and others might doe the will of God in earth, as the Angels doe in heauen: and yet tell him when hee breaketh the will of God, and his aunſwere is, I am not ſo preciſe, I am not ſo curious, I will not bee ſo holy, you are full of the spirite: and then hee will euen reproche that

which he ſeemed for to pray for. And theſe are the prayers of thoſe poore honeſt men which you thinke God heareth as well as the prayers of any other. I might goe thorough all the petitions and finde the like. It is exceeding great pitie that men want inſtruction: for a great multitude doe truſt to their pratling prayers, when as they doe not either vnderſtand what they lay, or els meane the contrary.
            
            
               Ath.
               If a man labour all the wéeke truely and honeſtly, and vppon the Sabboth day come to the Churche and make his prayers, ſhall wée ſay God regarded not his prayer, becauſe hée doeth not vnderſtande what he prayeth: his intent is good, hee doth his good will: hee hath a wife and children to prouide for, hee muſt followe the worlde, and let preaching goe, or elſe hee ſhall begge: and ſo longe as hee doth hurte no man, but dealeth vprightly: I thinke God doeth require no more at his handes. Such as haue naught elſe for to doe let them ſéeke for knowledge.
            
            
               Zelot.
               Yee are like vnto a hedge which is full of bryers and pricking thornes, a man cannot lay holde on yee vnleſſe yee bring

his hedging gloues, and his bill. Yee haue many thinges to ſhroude your ſelfe vnder, and to keepe the truth from touching of ye, as the Lorde in his worde hath ſet foorth the whole armour for a Chriſtian ſouldier: ſo likewiſe Satan doth by ſuggeſtion teache men to arme themſelues againſt the Lorde. But ye muſt be ſtript of your armour, at the leaſt ye muſt be ſhewed that it is no armour of proofe. Ye ſay that if a man labour trulye & honeſtly all the weeke, thoſe labour ſo which do it not alone for neceſſitie, but becauſe God requireth that men ſhould painfully trauell: and which haue the woord of God as a lanterne for to guide their ſteppes: for what ſoeuer a man doth, if it bee not in obedience of God in his worde, it is ſinne. To pray vpon the Sabboth for faſhion ſake, is very deteſtable, becauſe we are in continuall danger, and in continuall neede, and want helpe continually from the Lorde, vppon whome our ſaluation doeth dayly depende: we are commaunded to pray continually, or to haue our heartes watching thereunto. To pray without vnderſtanding, is not praying, but mumming. You ſpeake as though it were a thing which God doth allowe, that men ſhould ſeeke more after the world them

after God: & ſo make the world their God. And becauſe they haue wife and children to prouide for, therfore they cannot ſeeke to know God. As though we were not commanded to ſeeke firſt, the kingdome of God, that is to ſeeke that chiefly, and more then the worlde, and then GOD hath promiſed, that all theſe things ſhall be caſt vpon vs. Howe ſhall any man be excuſed when God maketh this promiſe vnto all: as he doth perfourme it vnto as many as doe truſt him. I haue been young (ſaith the Prophet) and nowe am old, yet did I neuer ſee the righteous forſakē, and his feede begging their bread. When ye ſay hee muſt follow the worlde, and let preaching goe, ye were euen as good ſay, hee muſt follow the Deuill, and let God go. And if an ignorant man coulde come ſo farre as to deale vp rightly, and to hurt no man neither in woorde nor neede, (which notwithſtanding they come nothing neere) yet this woulde not ſerue the turne: for there is a God who will be knowne and woorſhipped in that religion which he teacheth. Haue ye ſo fleſhly eyes that ye can looke no higher? Doe ye thinke God requireth no more but an honeſt and ciuill conuerſation towardes

men. God requireth euen of the poore labouring man that he ſhould (if he will be bleſſed) meditate in his Law, or his doctrine day and night. Pſalme 1. Likewiſe when he ſaith that the man is bleſſed which feareth the Lord, to the ende we might know which that man is, he addeth immediatly, he hath great delight in his commaundements. But the moſt part of your honeſt men nowe a dayes, delight ſo much in the word of God, and meditate ſo much in it, that they care not a button though they neuer heare it: they loue it and ſet as much by it as they doe by an old ſhoe. And are not ſo forwarde as you doe allowe, to ſeeke for the knowledge of God, when they haue naught els for to doe: for you thinke yee graunt a liberall allowance to God.

               Would yée make me beléeue that God doeth require that men ſhoulde leaue their buſineſſe: when they be poore and haue charge of children, and giue themſelues to reaping, and hearing of preachinges. Would yée haue him let his children ſterue?
            
            
               Zelot.
               God doth not require that men ſhould leaue their buſineſſe, but as they haue times to ſeeke for the thinges of the body,

ſo alſo are there times, for to ſeeke for heauenly thinges: God hath not made men for this life, but for the worlde to come. He hath ſet the promiſes of eternall life before them that ſeeke thē painfully in his worde, men muſt not be as bruite beaſtes all for the belly.

               What if there be within three or foure mile?

               Zelot.
               Yee goe about three or foure mile to the market for to prouide meate for the carion body, but yee woulde not allowe a man vppon that daye whiche is the market day for the foode of the ſoule to goe halfe ſo farre. Yee are the children of the worlde, earth, wormes, thoſe whiche labour for the meate which periſheth, but will not laboure for the meate whiche indureth for euer. Iohn. 6. Yee loue the worlde and the things which are in the world, and therfore as Saint Iohn ſayth in his firſt Epiſtle, The loue of the Father is not in ye, ye cannot ſerue God and Mammon.
            
            
               Ath.
               Let them runne that will, when

I ſee them agree better together, then I wil heare them: when they cannot agree among themſelues, they are vnwiſe which hearken vnto them.
            
            
               Zelot.
               Ye might be a counſellour for your graue wiſedome, who is able to aunſweare you in this matter: when yee daſh forth ſo ſtrong an argument grounded vpon ſo great reaſon, and infallible principles: but I pray ye what woulde ye haue done if ye had liued in the time of Ieremie the prophet, and alſo of other Prophets, when there were the Prieſtes and the rulers in the temple, with many which tooke vpon thē to be prophets, and to ſpeake in the name of the Lord, ſet againſt a few of Gods meſſēgers? What would yee haue doone when Chriſt preached, and the Phariſees and Prieſtes, and all the learned againſt him? Would yee not haue hearde Paule, becauſe he diſagreed with the falſe Apoſtles? The Scriptures haue foretolde that there ſhall be hereſies, ſectes, and falſe teachers in the Churche euen to the worldes ende. Your great skill hath taught yee to make ſo good a choyce of the time when yee wil heare, and to take ſo long a day, for I warrant yee it will not be two weekes before

the day of doome. Ye ſhoulde ſpeake plainely and ſay. Yee neuer meane for to heare, and that ye woulde wiſhe all other for to bee of the ſame minde: and then ye ſhoulde be little troubled with Gods woord. Crie out againſt the preachers, but let your meaning be againſt preaching it ſelfe. The Diuel is a very skilfull woorkeman, he doth not teach his ſchollers to ſay, fie vpon Gods woorde: but to finde excuſes how to ſhift themſelues from hearing the ſame.
            
            
               Ath.
               If they woulde teache men howe to beleeue better, then I coulde be content for to ſaye as you ſaye: But they woulde driue men into diſpayre, and bring them out of beliefe with the feare of damnation.
            
            
               Zelot.
               This wedge hath been driuen often enough alreadie, neuertheleſſe, becauſe yee are ſo knottie, and crabbed a peece to cleeue, I will giue it one blowe more: the matter is hainouſly taken that men preache ſharpely in reprehending the vices whiche nowe raine. They are nowe ſaide to preach nothing but the Lawe, which in deede cannot conuert a man from vngodlyneſſe, but of it ſelfe is the ſtrength of ſinne: they are

ſaide to be murtherers, becauſe they preache but the dead letter whiche doeth kill. No doubt whoſoeuer doth preache no more but the Lawe, and ſo damnation, is no miniſter of Chriſt. But here lyeth all the matter, men woulde be flattered and ſoothed in their ſinnes, they are loth for to here of any iudgement of God againſt wickedneſſe: and as they bee like vnto the people of the Iewes when the Prophetes were ſent vnto them, corrupt and corrupting themſelues, and grudging againſte the Meſſengers of God when they threatened vengeance, and willing them not to preache ſo, but to preache pleaſunt thinges: euen ſo are there nowe whiche lay pillowes vnder their elbowes and preache peace, peace, when all is corrupt in their liues, and therefore there can bee no peace. Hee whiche ſhall reade the Prophetes, ſhall finde the ſtate of the Churche then, and ours nowe, in all theſe thinges verie like: Firſt, all foule vices ouer ſlowing, as among vs: Secondly, the people preſuming vppon their blinde faith, and counterfet repentaunce, and hypocriticall prayers, as they doe nowe: Thirdely, the Prophetes ſent of God exceeding ſharpely

reproouing them, and denouncing the iudgementes of God againſt them: Fourthly, the people repining there at, and thinking them ſelues hardely dealte withall: deſiring to bee more tenderly handeled as to heare pleaſaunt thinges, and to haue them propheſie of wine and ſtrong drinke: Laſtly, certaine Preachers ſit for the turne, healing vp, and ſmoothing vp all with ſweete woordes, and telling them all is well, all is well. Hee which doeth but lightly reade ouer the Prophetes, and cannot finde all theſe thinges, is but a ſimple man. In like manner, he whiche doeth dwell among vs at this day, and perceiueth no ſuch matters, is but a ſtraunger.

               I abhorre the errour of the Catheriſtes or Puritans, I confeſſe that I am loden with corruptions: if that be your meaning, to charge mee with that opinion, which is wicked and diueliſhe. But if yee

take the name Puritane for one which hath more care to obey God, then the common ſort, and therefore laboureth to keepe himſelfe pure and vnſpotted of the worlde (as Saint Iames ſpeaketh) then looke to it, that yee be not founde among thoſe which reuile not men but God. If ye meane by preciſe men, thoſe which are ſo ſcrupulous, as to make ſinne where there is none, as your wordes doe playnely ſhewe, then doe I vtterly renounce that name for to be called preciſe, and I diſalowe ſuch fond perſons, whoſoeuer they bee. But I knowe you meane thoſe which walke preciſely as Saint Paule willeth, and doe take heede to their waies: not condemning men, but admoniſhing them, not in trifles, but in waightie matters: although you count them trifles.

You ſee not, nor conſider how greate the Lorde God is, and therefore ye dare affirme diuers ſinnes done againſt him to be but trifling and ſmall, ye meaſure not ſinne with a true meaſure, when ye doe meaſure it after the rule of a man.

               Wherefore haue yee not the reaſon then for to conſider, that thoſe ſinnes which ſeeme to bee verie ſmall, are exceeding great, becauſe they bee done againſt his infinite Maieſtie. the ignorance of this point cauſeth manye men for to make but alight account of diuers ſinnes, and euen to laugh at them: likewiſe to mocke at thoſe whiche make conſcience of them, counting them ouer preciſe and nice. Such men doe not knowe the Lorde aright in his moſt high maieſtie: They knowe not the waightineſſe of his lawe, euen in the leaſte point in it. And it is ouer childiſhe whiche they obiect againſt the godlye, haue not you infirmities? are you not men? What woulde they gather hereby, that becauſe men haue infirmities, therefore they may not reproue ſuch as wilfully and careleſly offende. The reſt of your ſpeech is a meere ſlaunder, a

deuice whiche the Deuill hath founde out for to ſhame true godlineſſe. For let a man haue but the tenth part of the zeale, whiche the woorde of God requireth, or neuer ſo litle a ſparke of indeuour for to walke vprightly, and he ſhall haue it caſtin his teeth, that hee thinketh him ſelfe halfe a God, and taketh him ſelfe to be as holy as an Angell.

Light is come into the worlde, and men loue darkeneſſe more then light, becauſe their woorkes bee euill. Howe well they eſteeme of them ſelues you can not tell: this is moſt certaine, that although a godlie manne hath nothing of his owne for to boaſt of, becauſe it is the grace of the Lorde, whiche hathe putte

the difference, yet yee may well thinke better of him ſelfe, then of the wicked. And ſuch as haue no regard to ſerue God but in a fewe wordes.
            
            
               Ath.
               Doe yée thinke that there be none which are ouer preciſe: which woulde ſéeme for to be ſo holy, and yet are not.
            
            
               Zelot.
               The Diuell is a cunning woorkeman, when he ſeeketh for to bring the trueth into diſcredite, he can play on both hands, hee can deceiue on euery ſide. And therefore he hath ſome vaine and curious braines which are ouer preciſe in thinges whiche are no ſinne, paſſing by foule and great ſinnes in themſelues, which is a great vanitie, and vnder colour of godly zeale, which they would ſeeme for to haue, they couer their bitterneſſe euen of wormewood, and Gall: which vncharitablie ſometimes they caſte foorth vppon ſuch as are more Godly then them ſelues. But this ought not for to bee any diſcredite vnto ſuche as are zealous and earneſt againſt thoſe thinges whiche are vices in deede, although they ſeeme for to bee neuer ſo ſmall: as for example, when one doth ſweare as you did, by his faith, or by bread, or fire: tell him of it: what is his anſwere: ye are ouer preciſe: I meane no hurte

neither to God nor men: I ſpeake earneſtly, I doe not lie: If it bee a ſinne, it is but a ſmall ſinne. But ſee how groſſe an excuſe this is, he breaketh the commaundement of God, and yet he meaneth no hurt: Chriſt our great teacher doth ſtraightly vrge it, and yet hee ſaith it is but a ſmall ſinne, a thing not to be regarded. How much diſhonour is this to our heauenly Maſter, to ſay that hee taught things ſo ſmall and trifling, that they are not to be regarded?
            
            
               Ath.
               Well, it is happie that we ſhalbe ſaued by faith in Chriſt, although we bée ſinnefull: hee hath ſhead his blood for vs: I lookefor to be ſaued by him, what would yée haue more?
            
            
               Zelot.
               It is happie in deede for thoſe which haue faith, for they are cleanſed from their ſinnes. But ſuch as you ſeeke no more but to make the death of Chriſte as an eaſie ſcore to ſet all vppon: for yee are like to the man which thinking that hee ſhould haue all of his hoſtis for ſcoring vp, tooke very liberally: ye thinke the reckoning is now ſo eaſie, that ye may ſet cocke a howpe, all is paide for. But if I ſhoulde trie your faith by the woorde, ye ſhould ſee that yee haue little enough: and therefore your ſcore will faile in

the end, and grow to a greater payment then ye ſuppoſe.
            
            
               Ath.
               Whatſoeuer you ſay, yée ſhal neuer driue mee from beléeuing in Chriſt: nor all the ſort of yee.
            
            
               Zelot.
               I would not for tenne thouſande worldes be the man which ſhould driue any one from the faith in Chriſte, I doe ſeeke to bring ye vnto the faith in Chriſt.
            
            
               Ath.
               Yee may kéepe ſuch ſeeking to your ſelfe, and let me alone: I beléeue as well as you, take care for your ſelfe, you ſhall not anſwere for me.
            
            
               Zelot.
               Nowe ye are ſure I trowe, for this night, ye haue ſtopped my mouth, and giuen me a bone to gnawe vpon. But I pray ye ſhall not I anſweare for you in no reſpect? What if I ſee ye are blinde and ready for to fall into the pit of eternall deſtruction, and will not put foorth my hande for to ſuccour ye, is it not to be laid vnto my charge, that I wanted loue? Therefore I can eaſily pull your bridle out of my mouth: and bee ſo bold as for to meddle with ye: wee will a little trie, becauſe ye bragge ſo ſtoutly, howe well yee beleeue. Ye beleeue Chriſt was crucified, and ſuffred vpon the Croſſe: but are yee able for to prooue that yee beleeue in

Chriſt crucified?
            
            
               Ath.
               I ſay I doe, are you able for to diſprooue me?
            
            
               Zelot.
               Sinne is not ſlaine in ye, therfore ye do not.
            
            
               Ath.
               Howe prooue yée that ſinne is not ſlaine in mee?
            
            
               Zelot.
               Becauſe it doth raigne in ye, therfore it is aliue.
            
            
               Ath.
               I knowe not what yee meane by that.
            
            
               Zelot.
               Yee are ledde by ſinne, ye delight in it, ye haue not mortified the luſts and concupiſcences of the ſame. And therefore yee haue not learned Chriſt, as S. Paule ſpeaketh. Epheſians 4. Ye haue not put of the old man, and put on the new man. The death and paſſion of Chriſt hath not ſlaine ſinne in yee, for to beleeue in Chriſt crucified, is for to be crucified with him, as the Apoſtles doe teach in ſundry places. The reaſon is this, Chriſte was not crucified for to ſlay ſinne in him ſelf, (for he had none) but in his members, which are ioyned and knit vnto him by faith, in them the force & power of his death doth ſhew it ſelfe: nowe he which hath not this worke of the death of Chriſt in him, that hee feeleth

himſelfe crucified concerning the body of ſinne, his faith in the pasſion of Chriſt is but a dead faith, and cannot ſaue him. This is the cauſe why S. Paule faith, Rom. 8. That thoſe which are in Chriſt, walke not after the fleſhe, but after the ſpirite. S. Iohn ſaith, 1. Epiſtle, cha. 3. Ye know that he was made manifeſt to take away our ſinnes, & in him was no ſinne. Whoſoeuer abideth in him ſinneth not, he that ſinneth hath not ſeene him, nor knowne him.
            
            
               Ath.
               Then by that reaſon, yee woulde prooue that all that beleeue in Chriſt are perfect without ſinne. I thinke all are ſinners.
            
            
               Zelot
               Whoſoeuer is borne of God ſinneth not. 1. Iohn. 3. 9.
            
            
               Ath.
               Is there any man which can ſaye that hee is without ſinne?
            
            
               Zelot.
               Not one which liueth in this fleſh.
            
            
               Ath.
               Then yee are contrarie vnto your ſelfe: for euen nowe yee ſayde. That whoſoeuer abideth in Chriſt ſinneth not, and hée which is borne of God ſinneth not: and now ye confeſſe that all are ſinners ſo long as they liue.
            
            
               Zelot.
               I am not contrarie vnto my ſelfe

but your blindneſſe cauſeth ye for to thinke ſo. Looke in the Epiſtle to the Romaines Chapter 7. and there ye ſhall find how S. Paule coupleth both theſe things together in himſelfe, which you iudge to bee ſo coutrary, that by no meanes they may be founde in one man together at one time. He confeſſeth that there was a lawe in his members, rebelling againſt the law of his mind, and leading him captiue to the law of ſinne. And yet a litle before in the ſame Chapter hee ſaieth, That he did not commit the euill, but ſinne which dwelt in him. The reaſon which he maketh is, that hee did conſent vnto the law, and would haue doone the good, but he did the euill which he hated. To make the matter plaine, thus it is. Saint Paule was regenerate, but yet not in full perfection, for the remnaunt of ſinne did abide in him: that which the part regenerate did, or coueted to doe, or conſented vnto, that he ſaith he did: and that which the corruption which did ſtill remaine in him, forced him for to doe, that he ſaith he did not, but ſinne which dwelled in him. Hee doth eſteeme himſelfe in the part regenerate, he counteth the remnaunts of the old man, to be but as excrements, or as a dead carion, which did abide

in him, and anoy him. His delight and deſire was vppon the good, he hated the euill, and therefore when he did ſinne, becauſe it was againſt his conſent, and againſt his will, it was no obedience which hee gaue vnto it: he did not therefore ſerue ſinne, neyther did ſin raygne ouer him, but exerciſe a certayne 
                     •
                  iranny ouer him, which he coulde not ſpeake of.
            
            
               Ath.
               I know not what yée meane when yée haue ſaide what yée can, all muſt bee ſinners.
            
            
               Zelot.
               Yee may very eaſily perſwade me to beleeue that ye know not what I meane: If your fiue wits were fifteene, they woulde helpe nothing in this caſe. Becauſe ye know not what this meaneth, yee know not what faith in Chriſt crucifyed meaneth, ye know not what repentaunce meaneth, yee can ſee no difference of ſinners: all are ſinners ſay you, and the death of Chriſt is that whiche ſaueth, not conſidering that the death of Chriſt firſt killeth thoſe whom it maketh aliue. For this cauſe men are greatlye ouerſhot oftentimes, when they come vnto a ſicke man, they thinke if he ſay, I beleeue Chriſte died for my ſinnes, and ſhed his blood for me, that then all is aſwell as may be. If it were

faith in deed in the blood of Chriſt, they muſt needes be in good caſe: for al that beleeue in him, ſhalbe ſaued. But they ſtay vpon a bare fantaſie, which is a dead & weak faith, not making them to feele the power of the death of Chriſte. Ignoraunce is ſo deepely ſetled in mens mindes, that let a man be neuer ſo wicked, neuer ſo far from true knowledge of God, if he can make but ſome general cō
                  feſſion, they neuer looke further. And becauſe they ſee almoſt all, (howeſoeuer they liue) find this, it maketh them alſo to be careleſſe, and neuer for to thinke of the newe birth, of which Chriſte ſpeaketh, when he ſayeth vnto Nicodemus: except a man be borne againe, he cannot ſee the kingdome of God: This newe byrth is ſhut out at the doores, & therefore no doubt God doth ſhutte them out of his kingdome which make no account of it.
            
            
               Ath.
               Make your ſelfe neuer ſo ſkilfull, yet yée cannot tell which man God ſaueth and which he condemneth.
            
            
               Zelot.
               It is not the will of God, that wee ſhould take vpon vs for to pronounce vppon any man, and to ſay he is damned: becauſe we muſt leaue the ſecrete counſell of God vnto himſelfe, who is not bounde vnto vs, to giue any account of his doings. But I pray yee let

vs a litle conſider howe this headleſſe bolte of yours is ſhotte foorth againſt true godlyneſſe. Thus you reaſon, no man can tell who are ſaued, and who are damned, therefore we are not for to care for tryall of our faith and repentance: and that therfore the rules which are giuen in the word of God in theſe points are nothing worth. Euery man may ſearche and know in him ſelfe, whether he be in good caſe or not: and we ought euery one for to trie our ſelues by that whiche the woord teacheth ſo plentifully. I woulde wiſhe yee to conſider what the cauſe is why the greateſt multitude goe to deſtruction: euen becauſe they knowe not theſe thinges, & therefore ſee not the great danger which they be in, but can boldly beare themſelues in hād that they ſhall doe well enough. Manye doe laugh euen in the middeſt of deſtruction, I meane that they can ſport them ſelues euen in doing thoſe thinges which are their bane: and all becauſe they truſt to this beliefe whiche you bragge of. For as on the one ſide true faith & true repentance, and conuerſion vnto God, doe ſalue all the ſores and ſickneſſes of the ſoule: euen ſo the common dead faith & counterfet repentāce may be called the diuels

plaiſter by which he doth a litle in the toppe, for a time, ſalue the deepe and deadly woūds, but they rancle within, and bring vtter deſtruction. It is great pitie that the woorde of God is not laide open in all places, that the people might come to the vnderſtanding of Chriſt and his power, in tranſlating them out of the power of darkeneſſe, into his kingdome of light: which is wrought with great and diligent teaching, becauſe men are made of a dull metall, and hard to conceiue ſpiritual and heauenly things.
            
            
               Ath.
               Well, I muſt leaue yee now: yee haue delt very hardly with me: it were good that you Puritanes ſhoulde conſider your ſelues, & become better ſubiects to ye Prince.
            
            
               Zelot.
               I am like to haue a very good farewell at your handes, for all my trauell in teaching yee. But I looked for none other rewarde from yee: the blacke Moore can not change his hewe, nor the Cat of the mountaine her ſpottes. I muſt ſuffer your reproch, for if they haue called the good man of the houſe Beelzebub, howe much more thoſe which be of his houſhold.
               Thoſe which conſider not them ſelues, are worſe then madd men: I told ye before, that I doe not allowe that vice. For your ſlaunderous

accuſation, I ſcorne and defie it: I may boldely take the Lorde as a witneſſe vnto my conſcience, that I doe honour and obey the prince, and that I doo condemne, hate, and accurſe all diſobedience vnto the higher powers. But this hath euer bin the readie way which the diuell hath vſed for too bring thoſe which feare God into hatred: by his inſtrumentes to charge them for too be enemies vnto Princes. Chriſt was accuſed of treaſon, and condemned as an enemie to Caeſar.
               Saint Paul diuers times, was thought to bee a man which did trouble the ſtate. And whoſoeuer ſhall reade the auncient ſtories of the Churche, ſhall finde that this continued ſtill from time to time.
            
            
               Ath.
               Are not there many which coūt thē
                  ſelues very holy, & yet breake the Quéenes lawes?
            
            
               Zelot.
               What if it ſhould fall out, as it doth fall out ſome times, that godly Princes command ſome thing which is contrary vnto Gods word, ſhould we obey God or men? It is a very groſſe thing to thinke that a man for obeying God doeth diſobey his Prince. I would know this alſo, whether the breach of euery particular lawe, doeth make a man

by and by an euill ſubiect to his Prince? if it ſhoulde, I thinke true ſubiectes might ſoone be numbred. Likewiſe, I would know this, whether a man whiche is diſobedient vnto God and deſpiſeth his lawes, can for conſcience ſake be obedient vnto his prince? Hauing bin found vnfaithfull too God, ſhall he be iudged faithfull to men? And where as ſuch as you crye out againſt thoſe whiche profeſſe the Goſpell, that they breake the Queens lawes, & are not the Queenes friēds? I anſwere ye thus. I will aduenture all that I haue, that let proofe be made, and thoſe which haue this moſt in their mo
                     •
                  thes the Queenes lawes, the Queenes lawes, as thogh they were altogether made of obedience, ſhalbe found to breake two for their one, whom they accuſe. If ye did crie out in this matter moued with a good cōſcience, then would ye be carefull for to keepe the lawes yourſelues, and if ye haue care of princes laws, thē would ye haue care of Gods lawes.
            
            
               Ath.
               Wherein can yée accuſe me?
            
            
               Zelot.
               I meane not to accuſe you, but to ſpeake that which I know by a nūber, they breake her maieſties lawes in their apparell, in their meate, in their woordes beeing blaſphemers and raylers, in quarrelling & fighting, in dicing and carding, & bowilng, and

in manie ſuch like. And becauſe ye ſpeake often of this, who are the Queenes friendes? I ſaye none but ſuche as feare God: for the wicked & vngodly do prouoke God vnto anger againſt the realme, and doe procure the deſtruction of it, God heareth the prayers of ſuch as feare and loue his lawes, when they cry vnto him for their Prince: therfore there can be no more vtter enemies vnto Princes, then ſuch as are wicked againſt God. Nowe this is a verie prepoſterous thinge, that you which are rebels againſt God ſhoulde beare men in hande that yee bee the friendes of the prince, & that ſuche as are godlie, they muſt be counted enemies.

               I can ſay no more but god bleſſe and ſaue her.

               Amen. I pray God for his mercye ſake graūt, that we may be thankful for thoſe exceeding great bleſſings which he hath by her heaped vpon vs, both for bodie & ſoule: and the Lord giue vs louing and obedient hearts towards her. And alſo I beſeeche God to keepe her out of the hand of her enemies, to gouerne her with his bleſſed ſpirite, that ſhe may exalt & magnifie his glorious Goſpell more and more, and repaire the ruines of his Church & ſo glorifie him in this worlde, that in the world to come ſhe may be glorified for euer. Amen.
