            The seconde is of the cōdycion and manere
            Of the vnstedfastnes, of this world here.
            The thyrde parte ī this boke you may rede
            Of bytter death, and why it is to drede.

            The same God, was euer in godhed clene

            That myght was euer in his trone
            There was neuer God, but he alone
            The same God was without begynnynge
            And maker fyrste of all thynge
            Without begynnynge we shall hym call
            And endles Lorde, of creatures all
            And ende of all thynge is he

            And as he made all thynge
            So shall he at the last, make anendynge
            Of all thynges, both in heauen and hell
            Of man, of fende, and of aungell
            That after this lyfe shall euermore leue

            Man is pryncypall, and shulde all other passe
            As ye shall here afterwarde soone
            That God made of all thynge, for man one

            Both to chuse and to holde
            Good or the euyll, whyther he wolde.

            In that place, from whens they fell
            An other cause is, for man shulde se
            That a man the more meker shulde be
            Euer when he sethe, and thynketh in thought
            Of the foule matter, that he was wrought

               ALl this worlde here, both longe and brode
            God it made, for mannes gode
            And al other thyngꝭ, as clarckes can proue
            He made onely for mannes byhoue
            If a man loue any thyng more by any way
            Than he doth God, that in heuen is on hye
            Than is that man to God vnkynde
            That so lytell on hym, setteth his mynde
            For God is more worthye, loued to be
            Than any creature, that men may se
            Syth he is the begynnynge of all maner thynge
            And of all thynge, make shall an endynge
            And thus I say by them, that gyueth them ofte
            To the worldes lykynge, that thynketh them lofte
            
               
And loueth all thynge, that therto falleth
            And suche men worldely men me calleth
            For theyr loue moste, in the worlde is set
            The whiche the loue of God, slaulyche doth let
            And for the loue of this worldes vanyte
            A man at the last, for barred may be
            From the hye heauen, where all ioye is
            There a man shall dwell without ende ywys
            But a great clarcke telleth, that is Bartylmewe
            There be two worldes, pryncypally to eschewe
            And that one worlde, is inuysyble and clene
            And that other bodely, as men may sene
            And the ghostly worlde, that no man may se
            Is the hye heauen, where God sytteth in trynyte
            And thyther shall we come, and there lyue ay
            If that we thytherwarde, holde the ryght way
            Nowe wyll I no longer, vpon this matter stande
            For soone after it shall come more to hande.

            In two partyes well deuysed may be
            For both partyes, men may well knowe
            For that one is hye, and that other lowe
            The hyer lasteth from the moone ful euen
            To the hyest place, of the sterred heauen
            And that worlde, is bryght and fayre
            For there is no corrupcyon, but clene ayre
            But sterres and Planettes, bryght shynynge
            As euery man may there haue vnderstandynge
            But the lowest worlde, that may befall
            Conteyneth holly, the Elamentes all

            And ofte tyme chaungeth, both to and fro
            
               
To some it is softe, and to some men harde
            As ye shall here soone afterwarde
            But that worlde, that passeth all maner thynge
            Was made for mannes, endeles dwellynge
            For euery man, there shall haue a place
            Euer to be in ioy, that here hath grace
            And that was made, for our aduauntage
            For there is ordeyned, our kynde herytage
            But that other worlde, that lower is atwyne
            Where that the sterres and planettes be set in
            God ordeyned onely, for our behoue
            By this reason, that I shall proue
            For the eyre from thence, and the hete of the Sōne
            Susteyneth the earth here, where that we wōne
            And noryssheth all thynge, that fruyte here gyueth
            To helpe man and beest, that in earth lyueth
            And tempreth our kynde, and our complexyon
            And setteth the tymes of the yere, in theyr season
            And gyueth vs lyght here, where that we dwell
            Elles were this worlde, as darke as hell
            And the lowest worlde, was made for man
            And for these encheasones, that I tell can

            And lyue in Goddes seruyce, and do his byddynge
            And holde his cōmaundementes, and done his wyll
            Them to knowe and kepe, and flye all euyll
            And here to be proued, in ghostly battayles
            Of many ennemyes, that man often assayles
            So that throughe ghostly myght and vyctorye
            He may gete to hym endeles glorye
            And haue than the crowne, of endeles blysse
            Where all ioye is, that neuer shall mysse
            
               
Twayne worldes togyther, here may befall
            That all men may earthly call
            One is this dale, that is our dwellynge
            Another is man, that is therin abydynge

               That they shall haue, that there shall dwell
               For hell is counted a peryllous place
               For there is endeles wo, without any grace
               Care and sorowe, that neuer shall lynne
               yet may nat the soule dye therin
               And it myght dye, as the body doth here

               But departyng bytwene the soule & the body
               And as I haue somdele before sayde
               This may be called a deathes brayde
               And a very remembrynge of mannes lyfe
               When the soule parteth from the body with stryfe
               As ye may knowe in your thought
               That kyndely darckenes is to be felt nought
               But where that no maner lyght is se
               Proprely there is darckenes in euery degre
               So that darckenes is dyreyuynge of lyght
               So is death of lyfe, when a man is hence twyght
               Thus fareth death, that all men dredeth moste
               When the lyfe fayleth, they yelde vp the ghoste.
            
            
               Men dredeth death for foure thynges.
               
                  
                  FOure encheasones in bokes I rede
               Why men death so moche drede
               One is for death is stronge and fell
               And hath more payne, than man can tell
               Another is, for the syght that he shall se
               Of horryble deuylles, that aboute hym shall be
               The thyrde is for acompte that he shall yelde
               Of all that he hath done in youth and elde
               The fourth for he is euer than vncertayne
               Whyther he shall wende to blysse or payne
               He woteth nat than, howe he shall fare
               For death is bytter, and full of care
               And so it semeth well, as sayth the boke
               For when Chryste dyed in manhed that he toke
               And or he dyed vpon the holy rode
               For drede of death, he swete droppes of blode
               For he wyst, or he to death gan passe
               What the harde payne, of bodely death was
               Than may we knowe therby full wele
               That the payne of mannes death, is harde to fel

               As it sheweth by many wayes to vs
               Therfore an holy man, in his boke sayth thus.

               As hereafter it shall be more playnely shewed.

               For the paynes of death, that be full smerte
               That is the last, and also the ende
               When the soule from the body shall wende
               A sorowfull departynge is that for to tell
               For they loue togyther, euermore to dwell
               And none of them, wolde froin other go
               So moche loue, is bytwene them two
               And the sadder that two be togyther in loue
               As a man and his wyfe, throughe God aboue
               The more sorowe, and the longer mournynge
               Shall be bytwene them, at theyr departynge

               Togyther they shall dwell, without any where

               And this departynge, may be called death

               And as the gostes, that fell from heauen
               And were put to hell, with an horryble steuen
               Therfore to euery man, it were wysdome
               To amende hym of synnes, or death come
               And haue God in mynde, whyle his lyfe is
               As the Prophete cōmaundeth, and sayeth this.
               ¶Memento creatoris tui antequā veniat tempus
visitationis tue.
               
                  ¶Thynke man he sayeth, and haue in thought
               How that made the fyrste of nought
               Whyle thou lyuest, and or thy tyme be
               When God with death, wyll vysyte the
               For death clene mannes mynde breketh
               And therfore saynt Dauid to God thus speaketh.
               ¶Domine non est in morte qui memor sit tui.
               ¶Lorde he sayth, that man alyue is nought
               That in tyme of death, hath nat the in thought
               But men may vnderstande therby
               The death of soule, throughe synne namely
               For the man that of God myndeles is
               It semeth in soule, that he deade is
               For God vysyteth vs by euery maner way
               Where that the tokens of death fele we may
               For yf we coulde vs well vnderstonde
               The tokens of death, eche day doth vs fonde
               Wherfore me thynketh, all that here semeth
               Is more deade than alyue, as wyse men demeth
               For the boke telleth, and wytnesseth before
               That a man anone as he is bore
               Begynneth towarde his death to drawe
               And with dyuerse euylles, often is guawe
               As angers and syckenes, that falleth all day
               The whiche deathes throwes, call we may
               And in other wayes, and perylles many one
               That oft greueth men, in flesshe and in bone
               Than is our byrth here but abydynge
               A bodely death, that is our endynge
               For the longer, that a man waxeth olde
               The more may this lyfe death be colde
               Than semeth our lyfe here nothynge elles
               
                  
But as it were death as the boke telles
               And to that other lyfe, come we nought
               Tyll death this lyfe, to ende hath brought
               But when death of our lyfe, hath made an ende
               Than knowe we nought, whyther for to wende
               Whyther that we shall to well other to wo
               But certes to that one we shall go
               And to good men, than death is the way
               To the ioy of heauen, that lasteth ay
               And to the wycked men, that passeth that entre
               In the payne of hell, they shall euer be
               Therfore saynt Dauid the holy prophete
               Thus speaketh to God, with wordes swete.
               ¶Qui

                  xaltas me de portis mortis vt annūciē oēs landes tuas.
               ¶Lorde almyghty God, forsoth thou arte he
               That from the gates of death, hast take me
               So that I may tell passynge all thynges
               The great multytude of thy praysynges
               In the holy gates of thy doughter Syon
               That gate as Clarckes telleth, that can theron
               Is holy Churche, that God fyrste chea

                  e
               Throughe the whiche, men cōmeth to the gateof peace
               And by the gates of death, as we may se
               The bytter death of hell, vnderstande may be
               From that same place, God kepe vs myght and day
               And grau

                  t vs his loue, as he well may
               Therfore we shulde hym serue, and his wyll worche
               In the trewe beleue of holy Churche
               So that we may, than afterwarde wende
               To the cytte of peace, that hath none ende
               But all men that shall to that place come
               Hence shall wende throughe death all and some
               
                  
But that death to them is nothynge euyll
               That lyueth here in earth after Goddes wyll
               And in suche holy lyfe stedfastly dwelleth
               As saynt Austyne the holy man, in a boke telleth.
               ¶Mala mors illi putanda non est, quem in vita sua
boni actus processerunt.
               ¶He sayeth men shulde nat, to them euyll death wene
               That in good dedes, wolde his lyfe mene
               For nothynge maketh a man so hye of boste
               As euyll dedes that foloweth the death moste
               For all be deedly, that synne wyll do
               And therfore saynt Austyne, sayeth thus therto.
               ¶Non potest male mori qui bene vixerit
& vix bene moritur qui male vixerit.
               ¶He sayeth, he may no euyll death haue
               That lyueth on earth throughe Goddes lawe
               But vnneth may men by any reason
               Dye in good death, that leadeth his lyfe in treason
               But that man, that hateth this lyfes lykynge
               Dare neuer drede of deathes cōmynge
               or after his death here, no payne hym deres
               As Caton wytnesseth in this verse.
               ¶Non metuit mortem qui sit contempnere vitam.
               ¶He sayeth, he that can this lyfe despyse
               Shall nat drede death, in no maner wyse
               For so dyd martyres, that theyr death sought
               For after this worlde, nothynge they wrought
               And also holy men, wylled to death be dyght
               To dwell in heauen, with God almyght
               As the bokes of theyr lyues, telleth to vs

               Than the day of byrth, that is full of mone

               Theyr lyfe is endeles, and ioy alther mest
               When the soule from the body shall begon

                  THe seconde encheason is, as I in boke rede
               Why that death is so greatly to drede
               For the dredfull syght of many foule fendes

               To take the soule, with them away
               In to the payne of hell, and that is theyr pray

               And horryble rollynge, and on hym blere

               Than is synne fouler, and more lothsome
               Than is the deuyll, that from hell may come
               For Clarckes telleth it, that be of cōnynge
               That synne is so foule, and so horryble a thynge
               That yf a man myght se, before hym his synne

               With great sorowe, both care and stryfe
               For in the same tyme, all thynge shall be knowen
               And in the same day, nothynge ben hydden

               And all good dedes done in good manere
               Than shall we all there, both here and se
               All maner pryuyties, that euer wrought we
               And therfore God sayeth in his Gospell
               In the same maner, that I wyll you tell.
               ¶Niehil opertum quod non reuelabitur.
               ¶There is no maner of thynge here so hydden
               That ne shall than be shewed and knowen
               And styll there abyde must we
               Tyll there all our lyfe clene examyned be
               Therfore saynt Ancelme, as the boke telleth vs
               Speaketh to the soule sharpely thus
               
                  
Thou wretched soule sayth he, what myght thou wyn
               When thou from thy body departe shall atwyn
               For than behoueth the acomptes to yelde
               Of all that thou hast done in youth and in elde
               From the begynnynge, that thou couldest wyt
               Unto the last day, for thou myght nat flyt
               And than shall welaway, forsoth he thy songe
               For thou hast spended thy lyfe here in wronge
               And than shall all thy synnes here ben shewed
               Whyther so that thou be lered other lewed
               Of whiche synne, thou shalt more drede
               Than of all the deuylles, that thyther the wyll lede
               And thus shall euery man, at his endynge
               There be brought to an harde rekenynge
               For no synne than to hym shall be vntolde
               Be it neuer so pryue, other kept in holde
               And I fynde wrytten, thre causes why
               That no man may trust than sykerly
               Upon his good dedes, that he hath done here
               And the causes why, be good to lere
               One is that all thynges, that good be
               From God they come, and nat from the
               So that all good dedes, that here be wrought
               Be Goddes owne dedes, and ours ryght nought
               But all our synnes, that we may do knowen
               Cōmeth all from our selfes, and they be our owne
               And an other cause there is also
               For bycause that we be redy euermo
               An hondred tymes rather to do synne
               Than once a good dede here to begynne
               And thus we may acompte, re
                     •
                  en, and rede
               An hondred synnes agaynst one good dede
               
                  
The thyrde cause is, for to shewe amonge
               For oft tymes our dedes be done with wronge
               And nat in good maner, as they ought to be
               And perchaunce they be done out of charyte
               And therfore our good dedes, pure good are nought
               But saynt Austyne sayth, our euyl pure euyl are wrought▪

               As a cloth defouled with thynge vnclene

               Howe he shall fare, when he his way take can
               But we shall byleue without any maner drede
               That euery man shall haue after his owne dede
               But therof be we nat syker in our lyfe dayes

               And also Isodore, as the boke telleth vs

               And speaketh of mannes lyfe, in this manere.

               Other a thynge that is done nought by all ryght

               To please almyghty God, that made vs all of nought
               So that all a mannes lyfe, is with sorowe lad
               Therfore no wonder, thoughe a man selde be glad
               What may a synfull man say therto
