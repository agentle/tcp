And alſo in the boke of Leuites, ſayinge fyrſt to Abraham. Go thou forth of thy coūtre & from thy cognacion or kynred. And come thou into the countrey the which I wyll ſhewe to the, a countrey abundynge or plentyfull of mylke and hony. ¶ Here is to be noted that where there is plenty of mylke, there is is plenty of paſture

and no ſkarſite of water, & where there is plentye of hony there is no ſkarſyte but plentyfulnes of woodes, for there be mo bees in woddes, and ſo conſequently abundaunce of hony, than there be bees, or hony, or waxe in the hyues in gardyns or orchardes, wherfore it appereth that whoſoeuer wyl buylde a manſyon place or a houſe, he muſt cytuate and ſet it there where he muſt be ſure to haue both water and woode, except for pleaſure he wyll buylde a houſe in or by ſome Cytye or greate towne the whiche be nat deſtytute of ſuch cōmodytes. But he the which wyll dwel at pleaſure, and for profyte. and helth of hys body he muſt dwell at elbowe rome hauynge water & woode anexed to his place or houſe, for yf he be deſtituted of any of the pryncipal les, that is to ſay fyrſt of water for to waſſhe and to wrynge, to bake and to hrewe, and dyuers other cauſes ſpecyally for parrel yt whiche myght fall by fyre were a great diſcōmodyous thynge. And better it were to lacke woode than to lacke water the premyſſes cō
               ſydered, althoughe that woode is a neceſſarye thynge, nat onely for fewell, but alſo for other vrgent cauſes, ſpecyally concernynge buyldynge and reparacyons.

AFter that a man haue choſen a conuenyent ſoyle and place according to his mynde & purpoſe to buylde hys houſe or manſyon on, he muſt haue afore caſt in his mynde that the proſpect to and fro the place be pleaſaūt, fayre, and good to the eye, to beholde the woodes, the waters, the feldes, the

For my cōſayte is ſuche that I had rather nat to buylde a manſyon or a houſe, than to buylde one without a good proſpecte in it, to it, and from it. For and the eye be nat ſatyſfye, the mynde can nat be contēted. And the mynde can nat be contented the herte can nat be pleaſed, yf the herte and mynde be nat pleaſed, nature dothe abhorre. And yf nature do abhorre, mortifycacyon of the vytal, and anymall, and ſpyrytual powers do conſequently folowe.

            THere is no thynge excepte poyſon that doth put ryfye or doth corrupt ye bloude of man, and alſo doth mortyfye the ſpyrytes of man, as dothe a corrupte and a cōtagyous ayre. For Galyen terapentice nono ſayth, whyther we wyll or wyll nat we muſt graunt vnto euery man ayre, for without the ayre no man can lyue. The ayre can nat be to clene and pure conſyderynge it doth compaſſe vs rounde aboute, and we do receyue it in to vs, we cā nat be without it, for we lyue by it as the fyſſhe lyueth by the water. Good ayre therfore is to be prayſed. For yf the ayre be fryſke, pure, and clene about the manſyon or houſe it dothe conſerue the lyfe of man, it doth comfort the brayne.

Many thinges doth infect, putryfye, and corrupteth the ayre, as the influente of ſondrye ſterres, and ſtandynge waters, ſtynkynge myſtes, & marſhes,

caryn lyinge longe aboue the grounde, moche people in a ſmal rome lying vnclenly, and beyng fylthy and ſlutteſſhe, wherfore he that doth pretende to buylde his manſyon or houſe, he muſt prouyde that he do nat cytuat his houſe nyghe to any marſhe or maryſſhe grounde, that there be nat nyghe to the place ſtynkynge and putry

Alſo there muſte be circumſpection had that there be nat about the houſe or manſyon no ſtynkynge dyches, gutters, nor canelles, nor corrupte dunghylles, nor ſynkes, except they be ofte and dyuers tymes mūdyfyed and made clene. Swepynge of houſes and chambers ought nat to be done as long as any honeſt man is within the precynct of the houſe for the duſt doth puttrify the ayre making it dence. Alſo nygh to the place let nat her flaxe nor hempe be watered, & beware of the ſnoffe of candelles, and of the ſauour of apples for theſe thynges be contagyous and infectyue. Alſo myſty and cloudy dayes, impetuous and vehement wynde, troublous and vaporous wether is nat good to laboure in it to open ye pores to let in infectious ayre, Furthermore beware of pyſſynge in draughtes, and permit

no cōmon pyſſynge place be aboute the houſe or manſyon, and let the cōmon houſe of eaſement be ouer ſome water, or els elongated from the houſe. And beware of emptynge of pyſſe pottes and pyſſyng in chymnes. ſo that all euyl and conragyous ayres may be expelled, and clene ayre kept vnputryſyed. And of all thynges let the buttery, the

            WHan a man doth begyn to buylde his houſe or manſyon place he muſt puyde (ſayth Jeſus chryſt) before that he begynne to buylde for all thyngꝭ neceſſary for the performacion of it, leſt that when he hathe made his foundacyon, and can nat fynyſſhe his worke that he hathe begon, euery man wyll deryde hym ſayinge. This man dyd begynne to buylde, but he can nat fynyſſhe or make an ende of hys purpoſe, for a man muſte conſyder the expence before he do begynne to buylde, for there gothe to buyldynge many a nayle,

many pynnes, many lathes, and many tyles or ſlatꝭ or ſtrawes, beſyde other greater charges, as tymber, bordes, lyme, ſande, ſtones, or brycke, beſyde the workmanſhyp and the implementes. But a man the whiche haue puruyd or hath in ſtore to accomplyſſhed his purpoſe, and hath choſen a good ſoyle and place to cytuat his houſe or manſyon, and that the proſpecte be good, and that the ayre be pure, fryſke and clene. Then he that wyll buylde, let him make his foundacyon vpon a graualy grounde myxte with clay, or els let him buylde vpon a roche of ſtone, or els vpon an hyll or a hylles ſyde. And ordre & edyfye the houſe ſo that the pryncypall and chiefe proſpectes may be Eaſt and weeſt, ſpecyally North eaſt, South eaſt, and Southweeſt, for the merydy all wyndes of all wyndes is the moſte worſt, for the South wynde doth corrupt and dothe make euyl vapours. The Eaſt wynde is temperate, fryſe, and fragraūt. The weeſt wynde is mutable. The North wynde purgeth yl vapours, wherfore better it is of ye. ii. worſt that the wyndowes do open playne North than playne South, althoughe that Jeremy ſayth, from the North depēdeth all euyl. And alſo it is written in Cātica cantico

Forthermore it is a cōmodyous and a pleaſaunt thynge to a manſyon to haue an orcherd of ſoundry fruytes, but it is more cōmodiouſe to haue a fayre gardayn repleted with herbes of aromatyck & redolēt ſauours In the gardayne maye be a poole or two for fyſſhe yf the pooles be clene kept. Alſo a parke repleted with dere & conyes is a neceſſary and a pleaſaunt thynge to be anexed to a man ſyon. A doue houſe alſo is a neceſſary thynge aboute a manſyon place. And amonge other thynges a payre of buttes is a decent thynge aboute a manſyon, & other whyle for a greate man neceſſary it is for to paſſe his tyme with bowles in an aly, whan all this is fynyſſhed and the manſyon replenyſſhed with Implementes. There muſt be a fyre kept cōtynually for a ſpace to drye vp the contagyous moyſters of the walles, & the ſauour of the lyme and ſande.

Our ſauyour Jeſus Chryſte ſayth, what ſhall it profyte vnto man yf he goat all the worlde and leſe him ſelfe, and bryng him ſelfe to a detrimēt, wherfore it appereth that a man ought to be circumſpecte for the helth and welth of his ſoule.

Replection or a ſurfet is takē as wel by gurgytacyons or to moche drynkyng, as it is takē by epulacyon of eatig of crude meate, or eatynge more meate than doth ſuffyce or can be truely dygeſted.

And in no wyſe eate no meate vnto the tyme the ſtomacke be euacuated of all yll humours by vomed or other conuenient wayes, for els crude and rawe humours vndygeſted wyll multiply in the body to the detrymēt of man. Two meales a daye is ſuffycyent for a reſte man, and a labourer maye eate thre tymes a day, & he that doth eate after lyueth a beeſtly lyfe. And he that doth eate more than ones in a day, I aduertyſe hym that the fyrſte refeccyon or meale be dygeſted or that he do cate the ſeconde refeccyon or meale. For there is nothynge more hurtfull for mans body than to eate meate vpon meate vndygeſted. For

the laſt refeccyon or meale whyll let the dygeſtyon of the fyrſte refeccy on or meale. Alſo ſondre meates of dyuers operacyons eaten at one refeccion or meale is nat laudable, nor it is nat good to ſyt longe at dyner and ſupper. An houre is ſuffycyent to ſyt at dyner, and nat ſo longe at ſupper. Englande hathe an euyll vſe in ſyttynge longe at dyner and at ſupper. And Englyſſhe men hath an euyl vſe, for at the begynnynge at dyner & ſupper they wyll fede on groſe meates. And ye beſte meate which be holſome and nutrytyue and lyght of digeſtion is kept for ſeruauntes, for whan the good meate doth come to the table thorowe fedynge vpon groſe meate, the appe tyde is extynct, but mānes mynde is ſo auydous althoughe he haue eate ynoughe whan he ſeth better meate come before hym agaīſt his appetyde he wyll eate, whervpon dothe come repleccyon and ſurfetes.
