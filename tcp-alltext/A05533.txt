            TO THE RIGHT
WORSHIPFVLL SIR
IOHN SCRYMIGEOVR
of Dudope Knight, Sheriffe
principall of Anguse, Constable
of Dundy, and his Maiesties
Standard-bearer in the Armies
of Scotland, his very good
PATRONE.
            
               WE are exhorted by
Saint Peter, to be
euer ready to make
answere to euery
man, that asketh a reason of the
hope that is in vs, with meekenesse
and feare. So must wee
bee ready to giue an account

of all our actions, if the honour
of God, the edification of
the Church, and the truth of
our profession doe so require.
Hereby I haue beene mooued,
at the desire of my Brethren of
the Synode of Brechin, to set
downe these reasons of my Resolution,
which I propounded
before them briefely in a Sermon;
to shew in what faith,
and assurance of a good conscience,
both they and I might
and ought to giue obedience to
the Acts of the late Assembly
holden at Perth. These I present
vnto your Worship, to
whom I know, they shall bee
most acceptable; not onely because
they are conform to your

owne wise & solid iudgement
against the whole externall order
of our Church; but also,
by reason of the sincere affection
that you haue euer carried
to his Highnes Person, and the
great estimation, or rather admiration,
that you haue of his
Maiesties surpassing wisdome,
as well in the Ecclesiastike, as
Politike Gouernment. And I
hope, by the grace of God, that
as vnder the protection of that
Standard, which you haue frō
your Noble Progenitors, and
they for their valour haue had
the honour to carry these many
hundreth yeeres in the Armies
of Scotland; our Nation
hath been often victorious, and

euer inuincible: So the veritie
shall march with courage vnder
the Patrocinie of your
name, and according to that
Martial Motto of your Armes,
DISSIPATE, shall scatter and
driue away these doubts, scrupolosities,
anxieties & feares, wherwith
custome, opinion, and
preiudice, doe enuiron and assault
the weake & tender conscience,
as with Armies of implacable
enemies, who will accept
no conditions of Peace,
and hauing deliuered her out
of their hands, shall restore her
to that liberty wherwith Christ
hath made her free; that with
confidence she may draw neere
to serue the liuing God, knowing

to put difference betweene
circumstantial indifferent alterable
Ceremonies, wherevnto
shee is not tyed in the worship
of God; and the necessarie substantiall
points of Religion,
which cannot bee changed,
without the vtter exterminatiō
of a good Conscience, and the
shipwracke of Faith. In this
hope I consecrate D.D.D. this
testimonie of my sincere affection
to your worship in Christ.
            
               Your Worships most
affectionate and deuoted,

CHAPTER
fourteene, Verse the three
and twentieth. Whatsoeuer is not of Faith, is sinne.
            
            
               THIS CHAPTER,
wherein the Apostle
teacheth the vse of
things indifferent in
the worship of God,
is closed vp with
three short and sententious Aphorismes.
The first concerneth those
that are strong, that is, fully resolued
of their Christian libertie: The sentence

is this; Happy is he that condemneth
not himselfe in that which hee
alloweth. The meaning is, the man
is happie, who being throughly perswaded
of his Christian Liberty, maketh
not himselfe guilty, through
the abuse thereof. The second is this,
He that doubteth, if he eate, is damned.
The meaning is, he is guilty that eateth,
or doth any thing indifferent,
doubting whether it be lawfull, or
not, because he is not perswaded of
his liberty. The third is the ground
of both the former, and this is it,
Whatsoeuer is not of faith, is sinne.
            
            For vnderstanding of this last
sentence, which is the ground of the
two former, wee haue three things
to consider in it. First, what these
things be that make a man guilty
of sin, if they be not done in faith.
Secondly, what this faith is wherein
they should be done. Thirdly, what
kind of sin it is whereof he is made
guilty. As for the first, the word

               Whatsoeuer is generall, and comprehendeth
all things, that falleth vnder
the action of man. Of these
things, some are commanded, or
forbidden by God in his Word, and
are simply good or euill: Some are
neither commanded, nor forbidden,
and these are called indifferent. The
Apostles rule, Whatsoeuer is not of
faith, is sinne, extendeth to both:
but because this rule is set downe by
the Apostle in this place, chiefly with
relation to things indifferent, which
may haue vse in Religion, whereof
immediately before hee hath beene
intreating; leauing the former, wee
shall speake of these.
            Things indifferent I call such, as
being considered in themselues absolutely,
are neither commanded nor
forbidden in Gods Word: First, I
say, neither commanded, nor forbidden,
to shew in what sense they
are called indifferent; not by reason
of their nature: for in nature all

things are the good creatures of
God: but in respect of the Law,
wherein they are neither discharged,
nor commanded, and so are neither
good, nor euill, Morally. Secondly,
I say, considered in themselues;
for if in practice and vse, they bee
affected with any Morall respect, or
intention of the agent, they cease
to be indifferent, and become either
good or euill, according to the quality
of his intention. As for example:
to salute with a Kisse, is a thing
indifferent: but if thereby thou testifiest
thy Christian loue towards thy
brother, it becommeth a holy Kisse.
Salute one another (saith the Apostle)
with an holy Kisse.
               Rom. 16▪ 16 And contrariwise,
if thou kisse with Iudas, and
Ioabs intention, it is a treasonable and
wicked Kisse.
            Thirdly, I say, considered absolutely:
for if they be considered with relation
to the exigence of occasions
and circumstances, they cease likewise

to be indifferent. As for example:
to eate or not to eate, of such
or such kind of meates, in it selfe is a
thing indifferent, neither commanded
nor forbidden:1. Cor. 8. 8. 
               Meat commends
vs not to God; for neither if we eate,
are we the better, neither if wee eate
not,
               Rom. 14. 17. 
               are wee worse. And the Kingdome
of God is not meate and drinke,
but iustice, peace, and the ioyes of the
Holy Ghost. This then, to eate and
not to eate, being indifferent in it
selfe, is made good or euill by the
exigence of occasions and circumstances.
If it bee said,1. Cor. 10. 28. when thou
art to eate, This meate is consecrate
to an Idoll; this speech, and the
conscience of those who are present,
maketh thy eating not indifferent:
but if thou eate, thou sinnest. Againe,Gal. 2. 11.
wee see that Peter was rebuked
by Paul, for that hee did not eate
with the Gentiles, but withdrew
himselfe so soone as the Iewes came
vnto him, because by his abstinence

and separation of himselfe from the
Gentiles, hee made the Gentiles
doubt of their Christian liberty, and
confirmed the Iewes in their errour,
touching the necessary obseruation
of the Ceremoniall Law. To stand,
or to kneele at prayer, is a thing indifferent;
but in the Primitiue
Church, to kneele on the Lords
Day, or from Pasch, till Whit sunday,
was not indifferent:Tert. de Coro. Milit. 
               Nefas ducimus
(saith Tertullian) because it was contrary
to the custome of the Church.
Then to conclude this point, in a
thing indifferent, three things are
required: First, it must not be commanded
nor forbidden expresly in
Gods Word. Secondly, it must not
in practice and vse be affected with
any morall respect, or intention of
the Agent. Thirdly, it must bee free
from the necessary exigence of occasions
and circumstances.
            The next thing to be considered
in this rule, is faith, out of the which

the action must proceed. Faith is
taken diuersly in Scripture, but that
whereby we and our workes are acceptable,
is of two kinds. The one
concerneth the iustification of our
persons; the other the righteousnesse
of our actions. That which
maketh our persons acceptable, is
our confidence in God, through Iesus
Christ, whereby wee are assured
of pardon and grace. This which
concerneth the righteousnesse of our
actions, is an assurance in our mind,
that the thing which we are to doe,
is not against the Law of God, as is
set downe in the fift verse of this
chapter. This last, is the faith which
is required, the other is supposed:
for the rule is giuen to Christians,
who are iustified by that faith, without
which it is impossible to please
God.Heb. 11. 6. Now as the faith which concerneth
the acceptation of our persons,
leanes to the promise of the
Gospell; so the faith that concerneth

the righteousnesse of our actions is
grounded on the precepts of the
Law, in such things as are commanded
or forbidden: But as for things
indifferent, that are neither commanded
nor forbidden, there bee three
generals, whereon our faith must repose
in the worship of God, Pietie,
Charitie, and Decencie. First, we must
know assuredly, that the thing which
we are to doe, tends to the glorie of
God; at least, is no wayes derogatiue
thereto: next, that it is not offensiue
to our neighbour, that is, it giues
him no iust cause, nor occasion to
scarre, or take exception against our
profession. These two grounds wee
haue in this chapter, the last we haue
in the end of the 14. chapter of the
1. Corinths: Let all things be done grauely
and orderly. So whatsoeuer thing
indifferent is not done with assurance
that it is neither offensiue to God, nor
to our neighbour, nor vndecent for
our profession, it is sinne.
            
               
Now what sinne this is, which was
last to be considered, is easily declared:
for if it bee offensiue to God, or
vnseemely for our Profession, whereof
God is the Authour, it is sinne against
the first great Commandement,
Thou shalt loue the Lord thy God
with all thy mind, heart and strength.
And if it be offensiue to thy neighbour,
it is against the second, Thou
shalt loue thy neighbour, as thy selfe.
            
            If these grounds be sure, it is manifest,
that although indifferent
things bee neither commanded, nor
forbidden particularly in the Word,
yet the vse and practice of them is
subiect to the generall rules of Piety
and Charity: and as euery man in his
priuate action, must haue respect to
these rules,Gal. 5. 13. and not abuse his liberty
to licentiousnesse: So must the
Magistrate in the Common-wealth
set downe Orders and Lawes to bee
kept by subiects, touching the vse
of such things; as of times and places,

for Iustice, for Markets, for the
exercise of Armes, for vse and abstinence
from meates at certaine
times and seasons, which things in
themselues may be done indifferently
at any time, or in any place, if policie
and decencie did not craue Order
to bee kept, whereby the priuiledge
of subiects is not impaired,
but ciuility established, and their vtility
procured. Euen so in the worship
of God, when rules are set down
touching Times, Places, and Ceremonies
of Diuine Worship, according
to these grounds, Christian liberty
is not abridged, but confusion,
schismes, and disorders are preuented,
Decency and Order are preserued.1. Cor. 14. 33.
God is not the Authour of confusion
and vnquietnesse, but of order
and peace, in all the Churches of the
Saints. The contrary whereof must
needs be, if in these things indifferent,
euery man were permitted to
vse his owne will: for as many wits, as

many wils, as many heads, as many
diuerse conceits. This meditation (I
hope) is not vnproper for this time;
wherein yet many are in the balance
of deliberation vnresolued
whither to sway. Some doubting
of the acts of the late assembly of our
Church holden at Perth, be determinations
of things indifferēt, or if they
containe necessary points & grounds
of diuine worship, whither faith
would, they should bee obeyed or
gaine-stood.1. Thes. 5. 20. Here it were good to
try all things, and after tryall to hold
that which is best. Goe to then, & let
vs put some of them that are most
controuerted to a proofe: For if after
tryall we shal finde, that the acts concerning
these, be such as in faith wee
may obey; then doubtlesse in faith we
cānot disobey: if we may obey them
without offence to God, or scandal to
our neighbour, we shall not disobey
wthout the offence of God, our neighbor,
& our whole Church. What the

reasons of my resolutions are, I shall
propound, and submit them to your
charitable censures: where I erre, I
shal not be ashamed to be corrected:
where we doubt, let vs inquire, and
where we accord, let vs proceed, and
goe forward together.
            The point most controuerted is
that, which concerneth the bowing
of our knees, at the receiuing of the
body and bloud of our Lord in the
Sacrament; For some hold, that gesture
of Sitting is a necessarie Ceremonie,
if not essentiall, yet surely
such as belongeth ad integritatē Sacramenti,
to the perfection of the Sacrament.
And others hold, that although
it be a thing indifferent, yet
it is more proper and agreeable to
the nature of this Sacrament, then
Kneeling; which they esteeme either
idolatrous; or at least such a gesture,
as being abused to Idolatrie, cannot
be vsed in faith, according to the
grounds of Pietie, Charitie, and Decencie.
            
            
               
               CHAP. I. That Sitting is not a necessary Gesture
to be vsed at the receiiuing
of the Sacrament.
               
                  SECT. 1. The forme of Gesture vsed by our
Sauiour, and the Apostles, at
the Paschal Supper.
                  
                     TO beginne at the opinion
that holdeth the
necessitie of Sitting:
it may bee presumed
that our Sauiour and
the Apostles obserued the same Gesture
and position of the body, at
the celebration of the Sacrament,
that hee vsed before at the Paschall
Supper.Mat. 26. 20. That Gesture is expressed
by the Greeke words,Mar. 14. 18 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     
                     Luk. 22. 14
which signifie not our formeIoh. 13. 12.
                     
of sitting, called in that tongue 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     ,
but a certaine kinde of lying
and stretching downe of the bodie:
for men of ranke and quality in these
dayes, sate not as we doe at Tables:
but lay at them on beds of repose,
not appointed for sleeping, but for
resting and easing of their bodies,
while they were at meales: Wherevpon
they did not commonly lye
downe, before that they had washed
their feet, if they were bare-footed.
Plautus in Persa, locus hic tuus est, hic
accumbe, ferte aquam pedibus. This is
thy place, come lye downe here,
bring water to his feet; and if they
were shooed, they did put off their
shooes, and layd them by, One telling
how hee went to table, saith,
Deposui solcas, I laid my shooes by.
They lay on their left sides, with their
brests towards the table, hauing the
rest of their body stretched downe
on their beds; as we reade in the sixt
of Amos: not euen downe, as when

they went to sleepe, but inclining to
the back-side of the beds, that they
might make place one to another:
For as wee sit one by another, side to
side; so they lay with their backs towards
their neighbours bellies, leaning
their head and shoulders at
their brests.Ioh. 13. 23. So Iohn lay on our Sauiours
bosome: when they drew vp
their legges a little, their feet did easily
reach to the back-side of the
beds, whereat the seruants stood, as
is manifest by these Verses.
                  
                     Omnia cum retro pueris obsonia tradas,
                     Cur non mensa tibi ponitur a pedibus.
                  
                  Seeing, saith the Poet, that thou
giuest all the dishes back ouer to the
seruants: why doest thou not rather
set the table it selfe behinde at thy
feet,Luk. 7. 38. where the seruants stand? On
such a bed, our Sauiour lay in the
house of Simon the Pharise, when
the sinfull woman stood behinde
him, and washed his feete with her
teares, and dryed them with her

hayres.Ioh. 12. 3. And so did Mary Magdalen
stand and anoint them: their Standing
sheweth, that his feet lay somewhat
high aboue the ground, for the
beds had a height proportionall to
the tables whereat they lay. Aeneas
lay vpon an high and stately one, Inde
toro Pater Aeneas sic orsus ab alto,
their standing behinde, sheweth that
our Sauiours feete lay back towards
the outside of the beds, where they
stood.Iohn 13. 4. & 12. Hereby it seemeth most probable,
that after the first Supper, or
rather the first seruice of the Paschal
Supper, our Sauiour did rise alone,
and went about the backside
of the beds whereon the Apostles
lay, and washed their feet, they lying
still at table, as the women did his:
for in Iohn no mention is made, either
of their rising, or lying downe
againe; but of our Sauiours onely.
This was the Table-Gesture vsed by
the Iewes, as is manifest by the sixt
of Amos, verse 4, 5, 6. by these Histories

of our Sauiour, and by the
words 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     .Luke 9. 14.
which signified to lye and leane
downe, either on a bed, or on the
ground: for on the ground they lay,
who had no standing table to eate
at; as the multitudes whom our Sauiour
fedde miraculously in the Desart.
And these Oppressors, and Idolaters,
whom Amos reprooueth,
Chap. 2. verse 8. in these words, They
lye downe vpon cloathes layed to pledge
by euery Altar, and drinke the Wine
of the condemned in the house of their
God. After this manner the Christians
are forbidden to lye downe in
Idoleio, in the Idol Chappell, and eate
their sacrifices. Thus 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     
1. Cor. 8. 10. is to bee interpret by
Amos words. As to the table of Diuels,
mentioned in the tenth Chapter,
it is not to bee taken for a materiall
one, standing in the Idols temple;
but for the thing sacrificed to
the Idol, which the Idolaters broght

home to their own tables, and therevnto
inuited the Christians, who are
forbidden wittingly to eate thereof,
1. Cor. 10. verse 21. 25, 26, 27, 28.
This was the gesture vsed in those
dayes at meate, whether it was receiued
at table, or on the ground;
not by the Romanes onely, but by
many other Nations, who did imitate
them, as Philo Iudaus thinketh in
his booke De vita contemplatiua,
which custome the Iewes seeme to
haue had long before their conuersing
with the Romanes, as it is cleere
by the prophesie of Amos. And learned
men hold with great reason, that
it is the most ancient of all Table-gestures:
for before the vse of materiall
tables, men behoued to receiue meat;
and except the gesture vsed by vs,
there could bee none more commodious
then this gesture of lying and
leaning. The Turkes sitting on the
ground with their legs plat, is not so
commodious. The knowledge of

these things are not vnprofitable for
vnderstanding of the Historie where
they occurre; and are to be obserued
against those, who affirme that this
Lying differeth only frō our Sitting
in this; that wee sit with our bodies
vpright; they sate with some inclination,
& leaning: For the contrary is
manifest by the word 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , that
signifyeth Sitting, from the which
commeth,Mat. 23. 6. that signifyeth
the first place of Sitting in the
Synagogues,Luke 9. 14. differing from 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      and

                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , that signifyeth the first and
most honourable place of Lying at
Banquets: For in the one they Sate,
and in the other they Lay. So both
the gestures were in vse, but in different
actions. Lying at Banquets,
called in Latine accubitio and accubitus,
because they Lay, and Leaned on
their elbowes, Sitting in Iudgement,
in Counsell, and in many other
actions. Finally, the feasters
stretching downe of themselues on

the beddes, Amos 6. Verse 4. The
shooes putting off, the washing of
the feete, that the bed should not be
defiled, doe euidently euince, that
they sate not on Benches, and on
Chayres as we doe, with their feete
at the ground. That our Sauiour
did vse this gesture at the Paschall
Supper, is manifest by Matthew,
Marke, and Luke, who testifie that he
lay downe thereto: and Iohn, that
he rose vp from it, and hauing washed
the Disciples feete, lay downe
againe. And it may bee presumed,
that he retained the same gesture at
this Sacrament: For the Apostles
being eating,Mat. 26. 26 
                     Hee tooke bread, and
when hee had giuen thankes, proceeded
in the action. Now, in our times,
to this gesture of Lying, Sitting hath
succeeded: and therefore our Vulgar
Translators of the Bible, for the capacitie
of the people, vse the word
of Sitting, which is our Table-gesture,
for that which in the Originall

is Lying, and was the Table-gesture
vsed of old.
                  This gesture of Sitting, I will not
deny to haue beene lawfully vsed in
our Church heretofore, at the receiuing
of the Sacrament; but that it
should bee onely vsed as necessarie,
the best, the most decent, and that it
may not be changed, I hope, no reason,
antiquitie, nor Scripture shall
enforce.
               
               
                  SECT. 2. The Reasons are set downe against the
necessarie vse of Sitting at the
Sacrament.
                  
                     ARGVM. 1. It is not certaine, that our Sauiour
did Sit▪ or Lye.
                     ALthough it may be presumed, as
hath beene said, that our Sauiour

and his Apostles obserued the
same gesture, at the celebration of
this Sacrament of his body, that hee
had vsed before at the Paschall Supper:
yet it is not certaine, when hee
tooke the Bread, and gaue thankes,
and blessed the Cup, that he did not
alter and interchange the Table-gesture,
with some religious gesture
of praying. For Athenaus recordeth
in his fourth Booke, that the citizens
of Nancratis, when they did
meete at their Banquets, after that
they had layed themselues downe
on the beds at Table, had a custome

                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                         To rise againe on
their Knees, while their Priest rehearsed
the prayers vsed in their Nation.
This declareth, that although they
had beene Lying at Table before,
yet when they blessed and gaue
thankes for their meate, they vsed
to rise vp againe on their Knees.
If this religious and reuerend gesture

was vsed by them at Prayer, is
it not much more probable, when
our Sauiour blessed and gaue thanks,
that hee and the Apostles did rise againe,
either on their feete, or their
Knees? which was their constant
gesture when they prayed, whom we
doe also imitate when we begin this
Sacrament, with blessing and thanks-giuing,
humbling our selues vpō our
Knees. If this our Sauiour and the
Apostles did, what warrant haue we
that they lay downe againe, and did
not stand still on their feete, or sit on
their Knees, according to the gesture
vsed by them at praying, vntill
the whole action of the Sacrament
was perfected? Thus what our
Sauiours gesture was at the celebration
of the Sacrament, is vncertaine.
But certaine it is, that vpon
an vncertaine example, no necessary
Religious imitation, and obseruation
can be founded. Moreouer it is
will-worship,Col. 2. 18. to hold and vrge any

point, for such as in the seruice of
God must of necessitie bee either
eschewed, or obserued for some diuine
respect; not because we cleerely
see in the Word of God with
the eyes of Faith that it is such: but
because, according to the minde of
the flesh, that is, our naturall reason
and affection, we conceit it and
will haue it to be such. Seeing therefore
it is not certaine by the Scripture,
that our Sauiour did sit or lye,
when hee did institute this Sacrament,
the gesture of Sitting should
not be esteemed and vrged, as necessarie
to be vsed thereat.
                  
                  
                     
                     ARG. 2 Proouing that the Gesture vsed by
Christ and the Apostles, was occasionall,
and therefore
not necessary.
                     THe time which was the night
season;Mat. 26. 20 the place which was a
priuate Inne;Luk. 22. 11. the order,Luk. 22. 20. after Supper;
the element,Mar. 14. 12 vnleauened bread:
these are not thought necessarie, albeit
they were vsed by our Sauiour
in the Sacrament, because they were
occasioned by the Paschall Supper:
and it is as manifest, that if our Sauiour
and his Apostles sate thereat,
they vsed that gesture by the same
occasion; for it was chosen for the
Supper preceding, and was continued
only at the Sacrament. For, as for
the Apostles, that they did not of
purpose sit downe to receiue the
Sacrament, is euident, seeing they

did neuer so much as thinke thereon
before it was instituted; therefore in
respect of them, the Sitting at the
Sacrament was occasionall, and accidentall.
As for our Sauiour, albeit
it be certaine, that he intended the
institution of the Sacrament; yet
that he lay or sate down thereto with
the Apostles, to recommend to them
and their successors the gesture of
Sitting, to bee vsed as necessarie for
euer in the celebration of the Sacrament,
hath no probabilitie: for if that
had beene his purpose, he had declared
it to them, either by word, or
a manifest example. Of it by word
he hath made no mention: and his
Sitting in that action, cannot be esteemed
exemplar: for a common
gesture continued in two actions,
without intermission, as that action
of Sitting was, which did begin at
the Paschal Supper, and was retained
onely in the Sacrament, cannot be
taken for exemplar in this Sacrament,

as haply it might, if Christ
had sitten downe to it seuerally, and
by it selfe; but seeing that our Sauiour,
in the Sacrament succeeding,
did onely retaine the Gesture vsed
before at the Supper preceding, it is
manifest that the gesture of Sitting
was not intended, and specially chosen
for the Sacrament, to be exemplar,
more then the rest of the common
circumstances of time, place,
vnleauened bread, which belong to
the Paschall Supper, and were retained
in the Sacrament; but was
onely Accidentall and Occasionall,
as these.
                     
                        Another Reason to prooue that it
was Occasionall.
                        And it is yet more euident, that
if Christ sate at Table when hee did
institute this Sacrament, that his
Sitting was occasioned by the Paschall
Supper; if the last act and conclusion

of the Paschall Supper was
changed by our Sauiour into the
symbolicall part of this Sacrament,
as some learned Diuines hold. For
it is recorded, that the Iewes had a
custome, after the Paschall Lambe
was eaten, to wash the Feasters feete,
as Christ did the Apostles feete, Ioh.
13. 5. Then after, for the second seruice,
to present a Sallade of wilde
Lettice, and sugared with a certaine
sauce (wherein it is thought
our Sauiour did dippe the sop which
hee gaue to Iudas) then the Master
of the Family did take a whole cake,Ioh. 13. 27.
or loafe of vnleauened bread, which
he diuided in two equall parts, pronouncing
this blessing on the one
part: Benedictus es, Domine Deus noster,
Rex seculi, qui sanctificasti nos mandatis
tuis, & praceptum dedisti 
                                 〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                              
Ioseph. Scalliger. De
emendatione temporum: Blessed art
thou, O Lord our God, King of the
world, who hast sanctified vs with

commandements, and hast giuen a
command, touching the eating of
the vnleauened bread. The other
part of that cake hee kept vnder the
cloth of the Table, till the end of
the Feast, which then hee brought
forth, and did breake it in so many
parts as there were Feasters at the
Table; Frustum erat magnitudine
Oliuae, quod s
                                 •
                              gellatim & ordine omnibus
porrigebatur: Euery piece was
the quantity of an Oliue, which was
deliuered orderly to euery one, with
these words: This is the bread of affliction,
which our Fathers did eate in
the Land of Egypt. Then hee tooke
the cup, and hauing said this blessing,
Blessed bee thou, O Lord, who hast
created the fruite of the Vine, did first
drinke himselfe, and then gaue to
him that sate next: and so it past
from hand to hand, till all had
drunken. This is recorded to haue
beene the last act and conclusion of
the Paschall Supper, differing nothing

from the externall elementall
part of the Sacrament, sauing it
may bee that our Sauiour hath vsed
an Euangelicall Thankes-giuing, in
stead of the Legall vsed by the Iewes,
and interchanged the words (This is
the bread of affliction) with the Sacramentall
words (This is my Bodie,
this is my Bloud;) and finished the
action with this perpetuall statute
(Doe this in remembrance of mee.) If
this conclusion, and last act of the
Paschall Supper, be changed by our
Sauiour into the symbolike part of
this Sacrament; then is there no
question, but if he vsed the gesture of
Sitting at the Sacrament, it was occasioned
by the Paschall Supper, the
last act and conclusion thereof being
transformed and changed into this
Sacrament.
                        Touching this, reade Beza his
great Notes of the last Edition, vpon
the 26. of Math, and the 22. of Luke.
                        
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     ARG. 3.
                     HOwsoeuer it bee, it is certaine
that if this Gesture was vsed by
our Sauiour, it was occasioned by
the Paschall Supper, or that which
went before, whereat they were eating;
and therefore if the time, the
place, the order and quality of the
Bread bee not necessarie, because
they were occasionall, farre lesse
shall this Gesture be thought necessarie
for the Reasons following. It is
to bee foundAct. 20. 7. in Scripture, and
Tert. de Coro. Milit.Antiquitie, that at such time,
videlicet, in the night season; in such
a place, in priuate houses; and after
the same order, that is, after supper,
or after meate, the Sacrament
hath beene taken, but that it was receiued
Sitting at any time after the
first Institution, either by the Apostles,
or any in the primitiue, or succeeding
Churches, shall not expresly

be found, nor by reason demonstrated.
Thus then I reason: If practice
and custome, for the time, the
place, and the order, ioyned with
the example of the first institution,
doth not import necessitie for obseruing
of these; farre lesse can a bare
example of Sitting, vsed in the first
institution, by occasion of the Supper
that went before, without any
practice following thereon, make
the example of Sitting to bee obserued
as necessary and best.
                  
                  
                     ARG. 4.
                     MOreouer, if the example of our
Sauiour and his Apostles must
bee of necessitie obserued in their
gesture, why should it not bee also
in their externall preparation and habit?
for as they did sit at Table when
they receiued the Sacrament, so they
did sit and receiue it with bare and
cleane washed feete. A Ceremonie

as significant as that of Sitting: for
the washing of their feete did signifie
the puritie and holinesse wherewith
our Sauiour did sanctifie his
Disciples, as is manifest by these
words: Hee that is washed, hath no
need but to wash his feet onely, for hee
is cleane euery whit. So their cleane
washed feete was a signe of that holinesse
wherewith euery one of vs
should present our selues to this Table;
as also of humilitie and charity,
whereof Christ did giue them example
in washing their feete; two other
necessarie parts of the wedding
garment wherein we should come to
the Supper. But if this externall habite
and preparation, wherewith
Christ and his Apostles did celebrate
the Sacrament, signifying the
Wedding Garment, bee neither
thought necessary nor expedient; by
what reason should the gesture of
Sitting, the signification and vse
whereof in this action, is no where

expressed in the Scripture, bee not
onely esteemed expedient, but also
necessarie?
                  
                  
                     ARG. 5.
                     FVrther, if the example of our Sauiours
Gesture at Table should
be obserued necessarily as best, and
should bee the parterne whereunto
wee should conforme our gesture,
then doubtlesse it should bee obserued
throughout all the action, and
in euery part thereof, wherein our
Sauiour did vse it. And if yee hold
that hee did not alter his gesture, but
lay still, as well at the Thankesgiuing
and Blessing, as at the giuing and receiuing,
which yee must doe, except
yee grant, according to the
truth, that it is vncertaine what gesture
hee did vse: Why doe wee vse
then three sorts of gestures in that
Action? For when we take and giue
the bread to the people, wee stand;

when we blesse it, we Kneele, and
command the people to Kneele; and
finally, when the Sacrament is a receiuing,
we will haue the people to
Sit downe againe. So for one simple
gesture vsed by our Sauiour, we practise
three, variant and different one
from another. If it bee answered,
that the Thankes-giuing wherewith
the action beginneth, is no part of
the Action, then it will follow, that
one essentiall part of the action, at
least, an integrant part is omitted
by vs, which our Sauiour did practise:
for the words of the Institution
which wee repeate at the celebration
of the Sacrament, are not Narratiua
tantùm, but Verba directiua; not narratiue
onely, but directiue words,
which we must follow and practice
according to the precept, Doe this
in remembrance of mee: And therefore
as we say, Christ took the bread,
so we take the bread; and as wee say
hee brake it, so we breake it; and as

hee commanded the Disciples, so
we, in his name, command the people
to take it, and eate it, which
they must also doe; and as hee said,
so we in his Name say, This is my Body,
this is my Bloud. If all be directiue,
and are performed by vs according
to the direction, then certainely we
must also giue thankes; as our Sauiour
gaue thankes; although wee
haue no particular forme of thankesgiuing
set downe, yet keeping the
grounds of the generall rules, the
Lords Prayer, a thankesgiuing
should bee conceiued agreeable to
action. It is thought that the ancient
Church, and the Apostles did onely
vse the Lords Prayer, and there
is none like it, nor more conuenient▪
if 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        , which wee interpret
Daily bread, doe signifie the supersubstantiall
bread, as it is taken by
many of the Fathers.
                  
                  
                     
                     ARG. 6.
                     HEere by the way I would aske,
with your fauour; If the example
of Christ should be precisely followed,
why doe we vary, not onely
in our gestures thus, from Standing
to Kneeling, and from Kneeling
to Sitting? But why do we that
are Pastors, all of vs, or the greatest
part, receiue the Sacrament our
selues Standing, and not Sitting, and
yet will haue the people, when they
receiue, astricted to the gesture of
Sitting, as most necessary and best,
which we obserue not our selues?
                  
                  
                     ARG. 7.
                     SO likewise I demand; If we should
precisely obserue the example of
Christ; Why doe we not once giue
thankes when we take the Bread, as
Christ did? And againe,M
                              •
                           t. 26. 27. blesse or

giue thankes when we take the Cup,
as hee did, and as it appeareth the
Apostles did? For Paul calleth it,
The Cup of Blessing,
                        1. Cor. 10. 16. 
                        which wee blesse.
To propound the example of Christ
to bee precisely followed in Sitting,
and not to follow it in such an expresse
point: next, not to follow his
Table-gesture in all the parts of the
action, but in such as wee like onely:
and finally, not to follow it our
selues in that point of Sitting, but to
vrge the people with that imitation,
might seeme rather to proceed from
contention, then from a simple religious
opinion. But the truth is, if
wee had receiued from the Reformers
of our Church, and had been
taught from our youth vp, to present
our selues to the Table, with bare
cleane washed feete; to haue blessed
the Bread and the Cup at diuers
times, and not at once; to haue either
Stood, or Sitten, or Kneeled,
during all the time of the action: we

would, without question, stand out
as zealously for euery one of these, as
we now do for Sitting. Adeo in teneris
assuescere multum est: such force hath
education and custome. Hence all
our weakenesse and tendernesse of
conscience proceedeth: so difficill
a thing is it to quit the opinions,
wherein we haue been fostered from
our Child-hood; for they cleaue and
stick to vs, as if they had beene bred
and borne with vs. It is an old saying,
Consuetudo est altera natura,
Custome is another nature: And it
is a true saying, 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        ,
there is nothing more difficill,
then to teach a man to thinke, or doe
otherwise then hee was first taught.
                  
                  
                     ARG. 8.
                     FInally, that this gesture cannot be
necessarie, is manifest by this Reason:
There is no necessarie Ceremonie,
that either belongeth to the

essence or perfection of this Sacrament,
but is set downe in the doctrine
of the institution thereof, either
by Paul, or the Euangelists. The
forme set downe by Paul to the Corinthians,
who professeth that hee
deliuered to them, that which hee
had receiued of the Lord; and in
another place affirmeth, that fidelity
is the chiefe vertue required in the
dispensers of the Gospell, and that
his conscience did not accuse him
that he had failed in that point: The
forme (I say) set downe by him,
containeth nothing concerning Table-gesture.
In Mathew, Marke, and
Luke, if we would know certainely
what things doe necessarily belong
to the Sacrament, then wee must
marke precisely where the doctrine
of the Sacrament beginneth, and
where it endeth. It is sure, that it
beginneth not at these words, 
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        ,
they being eating; not before,
except we hold the order obserued

by Christ to be necessary, videlicet, to
be eating another supper before; but
must beginne at these words, Iesus
tooke Bread, and end with this commandement,
Doe this in remembrance
of me. Betweene these two points
the whole doctrine is set downe, and
containeth no more, then Paul professed
to haue deliuered to the Corinthians.
And so there is neither in the
doctrine of Paul, nor in the doctrine
of the Euangelists, so much as
mention made of Lying, Sitting,
Standing, or Kneeling; whereby it
is euident, that none of these gestures
and positions of body, are recommended
as necessary. But that this
Ceremonie is left to be determined
by the Church, as the Time, the
Place, and the Order, are according
to the rule of Charitie and Decencie.
                     
                  
                  
                     
                     THE EPILOGVE.
                     THen to conclude this point, wee
see the gesture vsed by our Sauiour
to bee vncertaine, and that therefore
no necessarie imitation can bee
founded thereon. Moreouer, that it
cannot be more necessary (although
it were certaine) then the rest of the
circumstances of Time, Place, and
Order.
                     First, because it was occasioned,
as these, by the Paschall Supper.
                     Secondly, because it hath the naked
example of Sitting, or rather of
lying, without any practice following
thereon, which the rest of the
circumstances haue, and notwithstanding
are not thought to bee necessarie.
                     Thirdly, because the example of
the Apostles can no more enforce
a necessitie for the gesture of Sitting,
then for the externall habit and preparation

wherewith they receiued
the Sacrament, videlicet, of bare and
cleane washed feet, which is a more
significant Ceremonie, and hath
better warrant in Scripture then
Sitting.
                     Fourthly, because Christs example
can import no greater necessitie
for the vse of Sitting, in one part of
the action then another; and our
practice prooues, that wee thinke it
not necessarie to bee obserued in all
the parts: for in one wee Stand, in
one wee Kneele, and in one we command
the people to Sit.
                     Fifthly, because it is no more necessary
to bee obserued by the people,
then by the Pastor: And our
practice sheweth that wee thinke it
not needfull to bee vsed by the Pastor,
who most commonly receiueth
Standing.
                     Sixthly, if wee esteeme not all to
be necessary, which our Sauiour is
mentioned expresly to haue done, as

to giue thankes, and to blesse twice,
first, the Bread, and then the Cup;
much lesse shold we think Sitting to
be necessarie, wherof nothing is mentioned
in the Institution: and therefore
cannot be necessary at all, seeing
all things necessarily belonging
to the Sacrament, are so fully contained
in the doctrine of the Institution,
set downe by Paul, and the
Euangelists, that it were great
temerity to affirme any
thing to bee lacking.
                  
               
            
            
               
               CHAP. II. That to Kneele at the Lords
Table, agreeth with
Decencie.
               
                  SECT. I. How the Table of the Lord is taken
in Scripture.
                  
                     THus far hath beene reasoned
against the opinion
of those who hold
Sitting to be a necessarie
Ceremonie. Now
let vs come to their opinion, who esteeme
it more proper for the Sacrament,
then Kneeling, because it is
an vsuall Table-gesture; and because
Kneeling being abused to Idolatry in
this Sacrament, ought in their iudgement
vtterly to be abolished in that

action. Then to begin at the first,
and try what gesture is most proper
for the Sacrament: Doubtlesse, if
neither Lying, nor Sitting, nor Standing,
nor Kneeling be necessarie, but
all be indifferent, that gesture is most
proper, which is most agreeable vnto
the rule wherby things indifferent
should be determined: that is, the
rule of Pietie, Charitie, and Decencie.
And to enter this tryall vvith
Decencie: To sit at a common Table,
beeing in our times most vsuall,
must also be most decent for a common
Table; but that it is a gesture
most decent to be vsed at the Lords
Table, cannot be well affirmed, except
we first consider what the Lords
Table is; whether it be the same, or
like, or different from a common
Table. For vnderstanding this point
the better, wee would try, how the
Lords Table is taken in Scripture,
whether for the materiall, whereon
the elements are set and consecrate,

and where-at, and where-from they
are distributed and giuen. For if
thereby the materiall bee onely and
chiefly vnderstood, it may seeme that
there is little or no difference betwixt
it and a common Table, and that the
Gestures and Manners that are proper
for the one, may well agree and
be vsed at the other. In the 10. chap.
and 1. Epist. of the Corinths. vers. 21.
mention is made of the Lords Table,
in these words, Ye cannot drink the cup
of the Lord, and of deuils: yee cannot
bee partakers of the Table of the
Lord, and of the table of deuils.
As the Table of the Lord is taken in
this place, so shall we finde it vsed, I
hope, in all other parts of Scripture.
But here neither by the Cup can be
properly meant, the materiall Cup,
nor by the Table, the materiall Table,
because it is certaine, that hee
who is partaker of the table and
cup of deuils, may be partaker both
of the materiall Cup of the Sacrament,

and sit at the materiall Table,
whereat it is giuen: Yea, moreouer
may drinke the Sacrament of
the bloud of Christ, out of the one,
and eate the Sacrament of his Bodie
at the other; and yet the Apostle
affirmeth, that they cannot bee
partakers of the Lords Table: whereby
it is euident, that by the Table
of the Lord another thing must bee
meant, then either the materiall Table,
or the symbolicall externall part
of the Sacrament onely. What is
that? The Bodie and Bloud of the
Lord, the Bread that came downe
from heauen to giue life to the
world, which by a certaine colour
of speech is called a Table. So that
speech set downe by Moses, in the II.
chapter of Numbers, and the fourth
verse, Who shall giue vs flesh to eate?
is thus expressed in the 78. Psalm. Can
God prepare a Table in the Wildernesse?
Which words are presently interpreted,
ver. 20. Can hee giue bread,

and prouide flesh for his people?
                     Luk. 22. 30 When
our Sauiour promised to his Disciples
that in his Kingdome they
should eate and drinke at his Table;
neither did he meane by his Table
any materiall Table, or any naturall
Food, but that blessed, eternall,
glorious life, communicated with
him by the Father, which he would
communicate with them in his Kingdome:
according to that which hee
saith in Iohn, chap. 6. vers. 57. As the
liuing Father hath sent mee, and I liue
by the Father, so hee that eateth me, shall
liue by mee. Then to bee short, the
Lords Table, whereof we are partakers
here, and that whereof wee
shall be partakers in heauen, at the
great Supper of the Lambe, is the
Lord Iesus himselfe, his Bodie, his
Bloud, his Righteousnesse, his Life,
and the satiety of pleasures and ioyes
that are in him for euermore.
                  This then being the Table of the
Lord mentioned in the Scriptures,

whereof we come to be partakers at
the Sacrament, let vs see what manners
and gestures are most decent to
bee vsed thereat.
               
               
                  SECT. 2. That Kneeling is Decent.
                  AS it is true, that no place is more
proper for a common supper,
then a faire Chamber or a Hall, in a
priuate house or Inne, and no time
fitter then the night season, or at
euen; so there is no gesture more
decent with vs then sitting at Table.
But if the day-light, and the Lords
Day, a sacred place, such as a Temple,
and a reuerend order, such as to
receiue before other meate, be more
decent for the Sacrament, because
it is not a common supper, but the
Lords Supper: So a religious Gesture,
such as Kneeling, should seeme
more decent, then a common Gesture,

such as Sitting, because this is
not a common Table, but the Table
of the Lord.
               
               
                  SECT. 3. An Obiection taken from the common
Table-gesture, answered.
                  IT may bee replyed, that seeing
there is a materiall Table whereon
very bread, and very wine are set,
and seeing we eate that bread, and
drinke that wine externally, as wee
doe other bread and other wine, why
should we not vse that same externall
Gesture that wee vse at other common-Tables,
as most decent for the
outward action? I answere, first,
there is a great difference betwixt
eating and drinking, and the
Gesture and Sitting of body, that
men vse when they eate and drinke:
Eating and drinking are naturall actions,

in stead whereof, no other
action can bee vsed in receiuing
meate and drinke, but the gesture
is Moral, and voluntary, and changeable,
according to the custome of
Times, Places, and Persons, and the
nature of the action, wherein it is
vsed: and therefore although wee
eate and drinke externally at this Table,
as we doe at other tables, because
wee can eate and drinke no other
way, it will not follow that wee
should vse no other gesture, then
that which we vse at other tables, if
the nature and qualitie of this Table
require another Gesture then that
which is common, seeing the Gesture
is voluntary, and may, and
should be altered, as the nature of the
action requireth. Next, I answer,
that although the Bread and Wine
bee materially the same with common
bread and wine, yet after the
Consecration they are no more formally
the same; that is, they are to

be esteemed no more for common
food, but for the mysticall symbolls
of the Bodie and Bloud of the Lord.
And as for the Table, in matter and
forme is like other tables, but in
vse differeth, as farre as a spirituall
Table from a carnall, a celestiall
from a terrestriall: And who knoweth
not, that our manners and gestures
must bee composed, neither according
to the matter, nor forme of the
Table, but according to the vse
wherefore it is appointed? For what
is the cause when men come to the
table of Exchange, for to receiue
money, that they vse other forme
and gesture then at a table appointed
for meate? Is it because they
differ in matter and shape? No verily,
but because the vse is different:
Therefore at these wee vse such gestures,
and motions, as is meete for
receiuing of money; at this, such
as are most commodious for easing
of our bodies, and receiuing of

meat: Euen so, our gesture at this
sacred Table, whereon our spirituall
food is set and presented, is not to
bee proportioned to the matter and
forme of the Table, which is common;
but to the vse wherefore it is
appointed: that is, to the giuing and
receiuing of the sacred Mysteries,
and the communion of the Bodie
and Bloud of the Lord Iesus, which
thereby are offered and deliuered to
all worthy receiuers. To this diuine
and holy vse, as all our manners,
behauiour, and carriage should bee
framed, so should the Gesture and
position of our bodies bee; Otherwise
if any man thinke that wee
should vse the same gesture & manners
at this Table, that are decent to
bee vsed at other Tables: What is
the cause that at this Table wee vse
no speech nor conference one with
another, but in silence meditate with
our selues? Why sport we not, nor
are merry, but carry a modest and

graue countenance? Why are our
heads bare, and not couered? What
is the cause that wee touch nothing
presented on this Table, before that
it be offered vnto vs? Take nothing
before we be commanded? Neither
eate nor drink before we bee instructed
what to eate and drinke, and for
what end? Why are all our maners,
rites, and gestures vsuall at other Tables,
so changed at this? Why is
this silence, this grauity, this meditation,
the reuerence of the barehead,
this abstinence from touching,
from taking, from eating, from
drinking, before the offer, the command
& word of instruction? Why?
Because the vse of this Table being
meerely Religious, Spirituall and
Diuine, is so farre different from the
vse of other Tables: For heere, besides
the materiall Table that the eye
of the bodie sees, there is another
spirituall Table that should be obiected
to the minde, and beside the externall

elements and other celestiall
and eternall food, which thy heart
should perceiue. These are but

                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     ,
the symbolicall vestures wherein
Christ is wrapped vp; but that is
Christ himselfe, his Bodie and his
Bloud; therefore is it that we feare,
or should feare, to touch the sacred
things, before our hand and our
mouthes be sanctified by that diuine
Precept, Take, eate, and drinke yee
all hereof, and to receiue, before our
mindes and hearts bee prepared and
sanctified with knowledge and faith,
by the Sacramentall word, This is
my Body that is broken for you, This
cup is the new Testament in my Bloud,
&c. Doe this in remembrance of mee:
By the which word the vaile is remoued,
the Mysterie is opened vp, the
garments and symbolicall vestures
are taken away, Christ is made naked,
and is exposed as really to the
eye of our minde, and to faith, the

hand of our heart, as the sacred
symbols are to our externall senses.
The respect therefore that is due to
him who is the spirituall Table, and
the bread of Life, whom the hid
man of the heart sees and perceiues
there really present, makes all our
deuotion and religious reuerence;
for this respect a choyce is made, not
of a common, but of a sacred time &
place for this actiō; for this respect we
come fasting, preferring our spirituall
food to our naturall: for this respect
all our manner and carriage is holy
and reuerend. What then? Shall
wee esteeme Sitting a common Table-gesture,
and therefore dis-conforme
to all the rest of our carriage,
that is sacred, more decent for this
heauenly Table, then Kneeling, a
Religious gesture, and therfore most
conforme both to the nature of the
Table, and to all the rest of our Religious
manner and behauiour, that
wee vse thereat?
               
               
                  
                  SECT. 4. An Obiection taken from Custome
answered.
                  THIS (I hope) shall satisfie a
modest spirit, that searches for
verity, and striues not for the victory:
But if any list to be contentious, and
pleade from Custome, that Kneeling
cannot be decent, because custome
maketh Decencie, and it is not the
Custome to Kneele at a Table; I
grant it is not the custome at a common-Table,
because it is not commodious;
for commodity maketh
Custome, and Custome maketh Decencie
in things of this kinde. It is
not commodious, for it were wearisome
and painefull, to kneele so long
time as an ordinary supper will last,
wherunto men come to refresh their
bodies, both with ease and meate:
But the time being short that is spent

at the Sacrament, and seeing men
come thereto, not to ease and feed
their bodies, but to worship God,
and to worke their owne saluation,
certainely, to Kneele for such a space
cannot bee painefull nor wearisome
to those who are holy in Spirit, and
whole in body (sickenesse and infirmitie
makes exception) and therefore
although Kneeling is not, nor
hath not bin in custome at common
Tables, because it is incommodious
and wearisome: yet it hath beene in
vse at the Lords Table, farre longer
then Sitting, and is more vniuersally
receiued in the reformed Churches:
For we must grant, that before
Sitting, Kneeling hath beene vsed in
the Christian Church, neere foure
hundred yeeres at least,Better not to determine the s
                           •
                        t time, for 
                           〈…〉
                        
                      and therefore
it may bee maintained with very
good reason: Certainely it may bee
presumed, that it hath beene in practice
in all ages aboue, euer vntill yee
be able to designe some time when

another gesture hath beene in vse.
The induction of foure hundred
yeeres must either put you to an instance
or silence.
               
               
                  SECT. 5. An Answer to the instance of
Honorius.
                  AND heere let me tell you, that
the instance of Honorius will not
serue:Decretal. Gregor. li. 3. for Honorius did onely ordaine,
after the consecration,Tit. 41. at the eleuation
of the Host (so they call the Sacramentall
Bread) that the people
should reuerently bow themselues,
that is Kneele, as is manifest by the
constant practice whereby obedience
hath been giuen to this Canon.
This belongeth not to gesture vsed
at the receiuing: for in euery Masse
at the eleuation the people kneeled
and adored; and this was done before

that either the Priest himselfe,
or they, receiued; yea, when after
the people did not receiue at all, but
the Priest himselfe alone, which was
most frequent in these last times,
wherein the people receiued but
once in the yeere. But at what time,
and by whose authoritie Kneeling
began to be vsed of the people, at the
receiuing of the Sacrament, I hope
shall not bee certainly designed. For
by the contrarie, Honorius Canon seemeth
to import, that before his time,
the people vsed to Kneele, when they
receiued; because it ordaineth that
they should only Kneele at the eleuation,
and not at the receiuing, which
doubtlesse, it would, if it had not been
in custome before; for it is not probable,
but at the receiuing they
should haue beene ordained to haue
giuen the same reuerence that they
were appointed to giue at the eleuation,
had it not beene already in practise,
& therfore needles to be inioined
               
               
                  
                  SECT. 6. An answere to the instance brought
from the Custome of the Primitiue
Church.
                  ANother instance is brought frō
the custome of the Primitiue
Church. It was the custome of the
Primitiue Church, not to Kneele on
the Lords day, nor from Pasche till
Whitsunday, at any time in their
Prayer;Canon 20 & by a Canon of the Councell
of Nice, this custome was allowed,
and commended to all Churches.
Therefore vpon the Lords day,
and during the whole time, from
Pasche till Whitsunday, it is very
likely that they receiued the Sacrament
Standing: and the words of
Dionysius Alexandrinus making mention
of one who receiued the Sacrament

                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     ,Euseb. Eccl. li. 7. cap. 9. stāding at the

Table, confirmeth this strongly. This
instance I admit for the Lords day;
and for these, wherein the Primitiue
Church did not Kneele: for other
times and dayes, it maketh no probation;
seeing on other dayes, and at
other times, they might and did pray
Kneeling. Now although this instance
may seeme to make somewhat
against Kneeling at the first view;
yet being better considered, it fauoureth
the cause, that wee defend very
much: For first, if the Primitiue
Church did stand sometimes at the
Table, and receiued: certaine it is,
that they did not esteeme Sitting to
be a necessarie gesture. Next, that
they did not think, that at this Table
we should carry our selues as equall
to Christ, and plead for the Liberties
and Priuiledges of a Table: for in
those dayes wee reade of none that
stood at Table, in time of Supper,
but such as serued. Therefore it was
ordained as a punishment of ignominie

to be inflicted on Souldiours:
Vt cibum potumque caperent in coena
stantes,
                     Lyps. de Mil. Rom. lib. 5. that is, that they should sup
standing on their feet. Thirdly, here
I marke, that the Primitiue Church
did vse the same gesture in receiuing
the Sacrament, that they vsed in
praying; so that if wee would aduise
with them, what gesture they would
esteeme most decent for our times,
they should answere, That which we
are most accustomed to vse at publike
prayer. The custome then of
Standing on the Lords day, and
from Pasche till Whitsunday, being
now euanished and worne out many
hundreth yeeres since, and in stead
thereof, Kneeling receiued; Kneeling
now is the most decent gesture
that can bee vsed at the Sacrament:
For if you reason well from our Sauiours
Lying (had it beene a necessarie
ceremony) to proue Sitting that
hath succeeded: Then this Argument
must be strong from Standing

at Prayer and the Sacrament, to
prooue that now Kneeling should be
vsed, which hath succeeded Standing,
and is now most frequently
vsed in the time of publike prayer.
                  
                     EPILOGVS.
                     THen to conclude this point; If
either wee shall throughly consider,
what gesture is most agreeable
to so sacred an action; or what gesture
thereat may bee most euidently
proued to haue had longest custome
in the Church; or what gesture is
yet most vniuersally receiued in the
reformed Churches; And finally,
how the Primitiue Church did vse
the same gesture at this Sacrament
that they vsed at publike Prayer; I
hope no gesture shall be found more
decent to bee vsed at the Lords Table,
then the Religious gesture of
Kneeling: And thus much for Decencie.
                  
               
            
            
               
               CHAP. III. That it agreeth with Pietie, to
Kneele at the Sacrament.
               
                  SECT. 1. That Pietie requireth a most Religious
Gesture.
                  
                     I Come next to Pietie. In
respect of Pietie, there be
none of vs, that doe not
plead for Kneeling in
deed, when wee teach our people at
the Sacrament not to settle their
thoughts and mindes vpon the externall
things; but to lift vp their hearts
from earth to heauen: from the Pastor
who giues the externall element,
to God the Father that giueth his

Sonne, and to God the Sonne, who
giueth himselfe: from the Symbols;
the Bread and the Cup; to the Bread
that came downe from Heauen; to
the flesh and the bloud of Christ:
and therfore exhorteth them, that as
their hand is ready; so their hearts
may be prepared, and their minds, to
receiue the Lord Iesus Christ himselfe,
with faith and thankfulnes, and
that they come with a Religious resolution
in this action, and by this
action, to celebrate the remembrance
of his death, till his comming againe.
All these considerations, and diuine
Meditations, whereunto we stirre vp
our people; (First, of the order and
forme of giuing: Secondly, of the
gift: Thirdly, of the manner how
we receiue: Fourthly, of the nature
and chiefe ends of this Sacrament)
do al most euidently proue & euince,
that Pietie craueth of vs a most Religious
gesture to bee vsed in this
action.
               
               
                  
                  SECT. 2. The consideration of the giuer: and
the maner of the Donation.
                  LEt vs take a view of euery one of
them seuerally. The giuer, from
whose hand wee should receiue the
bread of Life, is not a seruant, such
as couereth our tables, brings our dishes,
serues and fils our cups, to
whom wee owe no reuerence. He
that here presenteth and propineth
vs with these inestimable benefits, is
the King of Kings, and the Lord of
Lords, God in the person of the
Sonne, vnto whom when we present
our gifts. If we should Kneele, as we
are taught by the Holy Ghost, in
Micha, chap. 6. verse 6. in these words,
Wherewith shall I come before the Lord,
and bow my selfe before the most high
God? Shall I come before him with

burnt offerings? with Calues of a yeere
old: How much more should wee
come and bow our selues before
him, when we are to receiue at his
hand the greatest benefit in heauen
and earth, The body and the bloud of
his onely begotten Sonne, the character
of his Person: the brightnesse of his
glory; the treasure of his grace; another
himselfe? And vnto this shall we finde
our selues much more bound, when
we haue considered after what manner
this gift is giuen, Euery good
gift commeth from him that is the Father
of lights: and so should wee acknowledge
it to bee; but God giues
not euery gift with a solemne externall
testification of his Donation,
made as it were with his own hand,
not in generall, but in particular to
euery one that receiueth, as hee doth
in this Sacrament. Other benefits he
bestoweth by ordinarie meanes of
his creatures, and by a secret prouidence
in such sort, that the action of

Donation is not perceiued, at the instant
of giuing and receiuing, but is
after knowne by fruition of the benefit.
And therefore, then is to be acknowledged,
when it is seene and felt
with Thanksgiuing, either priuately,
or publikely, as the qualitie of the
benefit requireth. So the Leper,Luk. 17. 16.
when he did finde and feele that hee
was cured of his Leprosie, returned
and gaue thankes: the operation and
working of the cure, hee could not
perceiue, till it was perfected. It is
one thing to receiue a benefit sent to
vs by a Prince, either by the hand
of his seruant, our equall, or it may
be by the hand of our owne seruant
or inferiour; and to receiue it from
his owne hand deliuering it, 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     ,
in state, and pompe openly
in presence of his people. As this deliuering
and receiuing is not to bee
compared with that; no more is the
gesture and reuerence, whereby it
should be expressed: a word there,

may suffice to declare our thankefulnesse;
but here, a word, a bare head,
a beck, are all scarce sufficient, when
we receiue the benefit of peace and
prosperitie, by the Kings good gouernment.
If in our hearts wee acknowledge
that benefit, and therefore
in our prayers cōmend him to
God, and be ready to obey him, our
thankefulnes is sufficiently expressed.
So when God by his secret prouidence
blesseth vs; or by any of his
creatures; either our Superiours, equals,
or inferiours, doth vs good;
If in our Chamber secretly, or in the
Temple openly, after the receiuing,
we declare our selues thankefull; it is
inough. But when in the Sacrament
God openly before his people professeth,
that he is a giuing and deliuering
to vs the greatest benefit that can
be giuen: certainely not onely should
there bee before and after the gifts
receiued, thankes giuen, but in the
very act of giuing and receiuing, such

reuerence vsed, as may sufficiently
declare and testifie how highly we esteeme
of the greatnesse and goodnes
of the Giuer; and how vnworthy
we thinke our selues to be of his inestimable
beneficence, what gesture
is meetest to bee vsed, according to
Piety in such a case; whether Sitting,
or Kneeling, let them iudge that haue
vnderstanding.
               
               
                  SECT. 3. A consideration of the gift.
                  SEcondly, if wee consider the gift,
it is not a bread that perisheth,
which is lesse worth then the life, as
our Sauiour saith, but is the Bread of
God that came down from heauen,
to giue life to the world, a food
more precious then all creatures;
and therefore such a food as wee are
commanded in the very Sacrament

to discerne from common naturall
food, and to eate that Bread, and
drinke the Cup of the Lord worthily,
except we would prooue guiltie
of indignitie done to the Bodie and
Bloud of the Lord Iesus: In the
which warning, as faith, and a religious
disposition is required in the
heart, so an externall reuerence answerable
thereto should be in the externall
action; for this the very word
importeth: Therefore hee that eateth
this Bread,
                     1. Cor. 11. 27, 29. 
                     and drinketh the Cup of the
Lord vnworthily, shall bee guiltie of
the Bodie and Bloud of the Lord: And
after, Hee that eateth and drinketh
vnworthily, eateth and drinketh iudgement
to himselfe, because hee hath not
discerned the Lords Bodie. This eating
and drinking here, must be the externall
receiuing of the Sacrament;
for the spirituall and inward eating
and drinking admitteth no vnworthinesse;
but is performed with such
discretion, as giues to Christ the

reuerence that is due to him, both
in outward action, and inward affection:
But the externall action of eating
and drinking may be vnworthily
performed, if either it be done in
hypocrisie or profanely. I call that
to eate and drink in hypocrisie, when
an hypocrite giueth all due and externall
reuerence to the Sacrament,
but in the meane time, hath neither
faith, nor the true and right estimation
that he should haue of the spirituall
benefit. To eate profanely, is
both to eate without the outward
and inward reuerence, that is due to
the Bodie and Bloud of our Sauiour;
for no man wants the outward reuerence,
but hee that hath not the inward.
They who thinke that the
vnworthinesse onely consisteth in the
want of faith and inward reuerence,
must thinke hypocrites onely to eate
vnworthily; yet it is certaine in this
place,1. Cor. 11. 21. that the Apostle findeth no
fault with the hypocrisie or superstition

of the Corinthians, but with
their profanenesse; for comming
drunken, for eschewing the poore,
and despising the Church: so this
vnworthinesse was as well in their
outward behauiour, as in their inward
disposition: And so consequently
the Apostle would haue vs
to discerne the Lords Bodie, not by
our inward estimation onely, but by
our outward carriage and gesture,
that it may bee seene of all, that in
the Sacrament wee doe chiefly consider
and respect, not the outward
and symbolicall elements, but the
thing signified, the Bodie and Bloud
of Christ, and that according thereto
we compose and frame our selues
and our manners; which if wee doe,
this question is at a point: For what
gesture, I pray you, can make a more
euident difference betwixt Christs
Bodie, the Bread of Life, and other
common Bread, by giuing thereto
such reuerence as best beseemeth

the dignitie and worthinesse thereof,
then the humble and religious gesture
of Kneeling.
               
               
                  SECT. 4. The manner of receiuing.
                  THirdly, to come to the spirituall
receiuing, which we know consisteth
in faith:Ioh. 6. 35. 
                     Hee that commeth to
mee, shall neuer hunger, and he that beleeueth
in me, shall neuer thirst. And
in the same Chapter after, Hee that
beleeues in me, hath life eternall, and I
shall raise him vp at the last day. And
Augustine saith, Wherefore preparest
thou thy teeth and thy belly? Beleeue,
and thou hast eaten. This faith is accompanied
with two inseparable
companions in this action, Prayer
and Thankes-giuing: for first, no
man commeth-worthily to this Table,
but hee that commeth with a

hunger and thirst after righteousnes
and life in Christ, whom hee commeth
to receiue: for vnto such onely
as are thus disposed, the inuitation
and promise is made; Esay 55. Ho,
euery one that thirsteth, come yee to the
waters. Math. 5. Blessed are they that
hunger and thirst after righteousnesse,
for they shall be filled. Luk. 1. 53. Hee
hath filled the hungry with good things,
and the rich he hath sent away emptie.
Psal. 22. 26. The poore shall eate and be
satisfied. And in the exhortation vsed
by the Minister before the Sacrament,
these words wee haue in
our booke: The end of our comming
hither is not, to make protestation that
we are vpright and iust in our liues, but
contrariwise wee come to seeke our life
and perfection in Iesus Christ, &c.
With this hunger and thirst, and
with this spirituall appetite, we
should come eate and drinke: And
what is this, but the feruent prayer
that the heart is offering to God,

while the hand is receiuing, and
the mouth is eating? For the substance
of prayer consisteth, not in
the voyces of the mouth, but in the
wishes of the heart to God, whereof
the voyces are but significant
signes. With prayer then wee come
and receiue, and our receiuing is in
faith, the mother of humility, which
in her selfe acknowledgeth nothing
but miserie, and therfore renouncing
her selfe, fleeth to the store-house
and fountaine of mercy, that is in
Christ Iesus, there eateth and drinketh,
feedeth and resteth vpon the
merit of his death, and the eternall
Testament confirmed thereby; the
sense whereof is more pleasant and
sweete to the taste of the soule, then
the hony, & the hony-comb is to the
taste of the mouth. For was there
euer any thing more pleasant, then
the meditation of the death of Christ
to the penitent soule, which being
wearied before vnder the burthen of

sinne, and bruised vnder the weight
of the wrath of God, well knoweth
and is perswaded, that Christ hath
borne our griefes and carried our
sorrowes; That hee was wounded for
our transgressions,
                     Esay 53. 4. 
                     that hee was bruised
for our iniquities, that the chastisement
of our peace was vpon him, that with
his stripes we were healed. Thus by
the meditation of faith, we eate, we
drinke, and feed on Christ with pleasure,
and ioy that cannot be expressed.
And is it possible that this ioy,
pleasure and delectation, that wee
haue in tasting the sweetnesse and
goodnesse that is in him, can possesse
the soule without thankefulnes;
that is, without such estimation of
him, and such affection towards
him, as presently resolueth in most
earnest wishes and desires, that all
the world might ioyne with vs in setting
forth his prayses? Now what are
these wishes and desires, issuing from
the ardent affection of loue, kindled

by a liuely and feeling faith, but a
true inward rendring of thankes?
Nam gratiam qui habet, refert; for
hee that hath a thankefull heart, after
this sort, giues thanks to God indeed.
So Christ is spiritually receiued,
first, when with our eyes and eares
wee deuoute him, asTert. de resurrectione carnis. 
                     Tertullian
saith; that is, when by these things
that wee see and heare in the Sacrament,
wee call to remembrance the
breaking of his Bodie, and sheading
of his Bloud. Secondly,Christus Deuorandus auditu. when
with a spirituall hunger and thirst after
the righteousnesse that wee know
to bein him, weRuminandus intellectu. ruminate, we chew
and eate not with the mouth and the
teeth, but with the minde, and the
serious thoughts of a celestiall meditation,
his death and Passion, vntill
wee haue sucked and drawne out of
it by diuine contemplation the full
assurance of reconciliation with
God, and of saluation:Et fide digirendus. And
finally, digest him, and his death,

not in our belly, but in our brest; that
is, in the depths of our hearts, by
trusting in the All-sufficient fulnesse
of the grace and goodnesse; yea, of
the God-head it selfe, that is in him,
wherewith our soules being satiate,
as with the fatnesse and sweetnesse of
Marrow, are enlarged with ioyes,
and filled with the wishes and desires
of his eternall praise and glory.
And therefore, as we do testifie our
spirituall receiuing of Christ in faith,
by the outward actions of taking,
eating, and drinking: So should we
testifie the serious wishes and desires
of the heart for our owne saluation
and his glory, with such an outward
gesture and carriage of bodie, as
is most agreeable to such sacred affections,
and exercises of the soule in
this action. And what is more agreeable
to the humility of faith, wherein
we receiue, and the hearty prayer
and thankesgiuing, wherewith
wee receiue, then the lowly and deuout

bowing of our Knees. Then
to conclude vpon these three considerations:
first, of the giuer and maner
of giuing; next, of the gift;
thirdly, of the manner of receiuing,
I ground and build this Argument:
                  Whatsoeuer Gift our Sauiour deliuereth
to all not coniunctly, but seuerally
to euery one of them by himselfe,
and that all not coniunctly, but
seuerally should receiue from his
hand with Prayer and Thankesgiuing,
in presence of the Congregation
of the Saints, and in a solemne
act of Diuine Worship:
                  A gift, I say, that is giuen, and should
bee taken after such a manner, may
bee very lawfully receiued by euery
one reuerently sitting on his Knees.
                  But the Body and Bloud of Iesus Christ
in the Sacrament, is a gift that is giuen,
and should be taken after such
a manner:
                  Therefore the Bodie and Bloud of Iesus
Christ in the Sacrament, may very

lawfully be receiued by euery one reuerently
sitting on his knees.
                  Thus I prooue the lawfulnesse of
Kneeling, the expediencie shall bee
after cleered.
               
               
                  SECT. 5. The Nature of the Sacrament.
                  NOW to come to the last thing,
which wee propounded to bee
considered in this tryall of piety, that
is, the nature of the Sacrament. The
nature of the Sacrament is to bee
esteemed according to the chiefe
end wherefore it was instituted, and
these bee two: the one concerneth
God, and our Sauiour Christ; the
other, the Church. The end which
concerneth the faithfull, is their vnion
with Christ, and amongst themselues,
to saluation: The end that
concerneth God and our Sauiour, is

the prayse of his glorious grace. In
respect of the first end, it is called,
The communion of the Bodie and
Bloud of Christ, the Table, and
the Supper of the Lord: and in respect
of the second, it is the commemoration,
and predication of the
death of Christ. The action in number
is one, whereby these ends are
attained and produced, but is diuersly
to be considered, according to
the diuersitie of these ends. In respect
of the first, it is a representation
of the sacrifice of Christ, and
the application thereof to vs; whereby
our vnion with him, and amongst
our selues, is performed: and in this
respect it hath two parts; In the first,
the death of Christ, the oblation
and sacrificing of himselfe, (which
really was onely done vpon the
Crosse) is mystically acted in the
breaking of the bread, and taking of
the cup; whereby the breaking of
his Body, and sheading of his Bloud

is represented, and therefore it may
be, and is rightly called a representatiue
sacrifice. The next part is, the
application of this sacrifice to the
faithfull: This part is acted, first,
mystically, by the command giuen in
the name of Christ, Take, eate; and
by the obedience giuen by the people
in taking and eating the externall
elements: like as vnder the Law, first
the oblation was made, and then the
people did eate of the sacrifices.
Next, this application is acted really
and spiritually, by the Sacramentall
word; This is my Bodie which is broken
for you: This cup is the new Testament
in my Bloud. By this word, accompanied
with the power of the Spirit,
two things are done, whereby the
reall and spirituall application of the
Propitiatorie Sacrifice is made; first,
the mysterie that went before, is opened
vp and interpreted, which represented
the sacrificing of Christ, and
the application of his Sacrifice. The

sacrificing of Christ, which was
symbolically represented in taking
and breaking of the bread, is explaned
by that parcell of the word, This
is my Bodie which is broken: This is my
Bloud which is shed. The application
of this Sacrifice to the faithfull,
which was symbolically represented
in the giuing, taking, and eating
of the elements, is expounded in the
other parcell; Broken for you, shed for
the remission of the sinnes of many.
This explication and declaration of
the Mysterie by the Word, is a reall
and spirituall application of the sacrifice
of Christ, and the benefit
thereof to the minde and vnderstanding
of the Receiuer, to bee considered
and pondered in the ballance
of a wise and spirituall iudgement.
This is the first thing that is done by
the word: next, by this word, the
last Will and Testament of Christ is
declared, wherein he maketh a reall
donation and disposition of himselfe,

and of all his graces and gifts
to the worthy receiuers; The Bread
which wee breake, is it not (saith the
Apostle) the communion of the Bodie
of Christ? And the Cup which we blesse,
is it not the communion of the Bloud of
Christ? How is this Bread and this
Cup the communion of his Bodie,
and of his Bloud? How? But by the
Sacramentall word: wherein he declareth,
that the Bread and the Cup
are the instruments of the communication
and disposition of his Bodie
and Bloud, and the seales whereby
he confirmeth the same. This declaration
conuaied with the inward
grace and operation of the Spirit, is
a reall application of the sacrifice of
Christ, and the eternall Testament
confirmed thereby to the heart and
the will of the Receiuer, that witl
heart, will, and affection hee may
trust and reioyce therein. Thus th
                        •
                     
application is acted really and spir
                        •
                     
                     tually
on the part of Christ: and 
                        〈◊〉
                     
                     
the part of the receiuer it is acted
likewise, when he considereth and
pondereth in his mind, as he should,
the death of Christ, and the benefit
thereof declared by the Word;
and next, when he resteth and reposeth
thereon with a full confidence
of saluation, according to the will
of Christ, declared and testified by
the same VVord. This is the spirituall
application and reall receiuing of the
Lord Iesus with all his benefites. So
many as receiued him (saith Iohn) he
gaue them this prerogatiue, that they
should be called the sonnes of God. But
who are they that receiued him? All
those (saith hee) that beleeued in his
Name. Then to receiue him, is to
beleeue in his name. In this beliefe
and faith, standeth our participation
of the Lords Table, and the eating
and drinking at his Supper,
whereby we haue communion with
him and amongst our selues. And
all this is effectuall, by this Sacramental

Word (This is my Body, this is
my Bloud) because both it is,
                        Quo res sensiles fiunt intelligibiles. Whereby the meaning of the externall things which wee propounded to the senses, is declared to the minde. 
                     verbum
expositiuum mysterii, and Dispositiuum
Testamenti; the word that expoundeth
the mysterie to the vnderstanding,
and is the dispositiue word of
the Testament: or the Word that
declareth and testifieth the Legacie,
and Letter-will of Christ, giuing
and deliuering himselfe to the hand
of our faith.
               
               
                  SECT. 6. The difference betweene the Sacramentall
Word, and the Word
preached.
                  AND heere by the way, it shall
not be vnprofitable to consider
the difference betwixt this Sacramentall
Word, and the Word preached.
The Word preached is onely
Promissorium and Conditionatum,
                     
that is, promissorie and conditionall,
because in it life eternall is promised,
vpon condition that wee repent and
beleeue in Iesus Christ: and it is true,
that by the Word preached, wee are
taught, and perswaded to beleeue,
and to present our selues to the Sacraments.
Then the Sacramentall
Word, annexed to the Symbolicall
Mysteries, declareth that Iesus Christ
hath made, and by the present action
of the Sacrament, maketh an actuall
and reall disposition and donation
of the benefits promised in the
Word preached, because the condition
therein required, is performed
in vs by the true perswasion and profession
of faith. So in the Word
preached, the promise is made vpon
condition of faith: But in the Sacramentall
Word, because the condition
is presumed to bee fulfilled, a
simple donation and disposition is
made of the things promised. And
herein consisteth the dignitie of the

Sacraments. First, that they are onely
ministred to the Beleeuers, and
the Beleeuers are onely admitted to
them: But the VVord is preached
to all, and all are admitted to the
hearing thereof. Secondly, in the
Word, a promise is onely made of
righteousnesse and life; but in the
Sacrament, a reall donation and disposition
is made of the things promised.
Thirdly, in the Word, the
promise is onely made in generall;
but in the Sacraments, the thing promised
is applyed in particular.
Fourthly, in the Word, the promise
is conditionall, if wee beleeue and
perseuer in faith: but in the Sacraments,
the donation is simple, because
it presupposeth faith and perseuerance.
Fifthly, in the Sacraments,
there is an externall solemne
binding vp of a couenant betwixt
God and the faithfull: But by the
Word preached, and the hearing
thereof, the people are onely perswaded,

either to enter in this Couenant
by beleeuing, or continue therein,
if they beleeue alreadie. It is
true, that by the power of the Word
preached, faith is wrought in the
hearts of the hearers, whereby they
enter in a hid and secret Couenant
with God, and God with them:
They with God by beleeuing in him;
and hee with them, by imputation of
faith to them for righteousnesse. This
I call an hid, and secret Couenant,
because it is onely knowne to God
and to their owne hearts: To God
it is knowne; for hee sees and searches
the heart and the reines, and
knoweth them that trust in him:
To them it is knowne by the testimonie
of the Spirit of God, testifying
with their spirit, that they are receiued
in his fauour; and that their faith
is imputed to them for righteousnesse:
for the Spirit of God testifies
in the Word, that the Beleeuers are
iustified, and our spirit and conscience

testifieth that we beleeue, and
consequently that wee are iustified.
Moreouer, the same beliefe and
faith which our spirit testifieth to be
in vs, being the worke and effect of
Gods Spirit in vs, is a realt estimonie
giuen by the Spirit of God, of our
Iustification. The Spirit then of
God, both in generall in the Word,
and by his owne particular worke in
vs, testifieth, that wee are receiued
in Gods fauour; and our spirit priuy
to this Testimonie, concurreth and
testifieth with the Spirit of God. So
this Couenant is secret and hid, because
it is not knowne to men, yet it
hath three most famous and faithfull
Witnesses; God, his Spirit, and our
conscience. But to returne, in binding
vp of this secret Couenant, neither
is Gods part acted by preaching
of the Word, nor our part by hearing:
for by the Preaching he onely
promises to receiue vs in grace, if
wee beleeue, and to continue his fauour

with vs if wee perseuer in faith:
and hearing on our part, is not the
condition that is craued, and must
bee performed of vs, but faith, which
we must declare, when we solemnely
enter in Couenant with him; not
by a simple applying of our eare to
heare, but by an open and publicke
testification, both in word and work,
that wee haue heard and beleeue.
The Couenant thus begunne in secret
betwixt God and man, is solemnized
by the Sacraments, in the
which action man maketh a publike
profession of his faith in God,
in comming to receiue, and in receiuing
the signe and badge of his
Faith and Religion towards God,
and the Instrument and Seale of his
iustification & saluation from God;
and after this manner mans part is
acted in the outward and solemne
binding vp of the Couenant: As on
the other side, God acteth his part
by receiuing man in his fauour and

grace, admitting him to the communion
of Saints in the Sacrament
of Baptisme; and by disponing and
giuing to him the Bodie and the
Bloud of his Son Iesus Christ, and
the new Testament confirmed thereby
in the Sacrament of the Supper,
to assure him that his fauour and loue
shall constantly remaine with him
for euer.
               
               
                  SECT. 7. That greater, and more particular reuerence
must be vsed in receiuing
the Sacrament, then in hearing
the Word.
                  HEreby it is euident, that although
the preaching of the
Word be a work of greater moment
and charge, oneris & operae maioris,
and more excellent in regard of the
gifts required in the Pastor, and

more necessarie to saluation, then the
administration of the Sacraments;
yet certaine it is, that to be admitted
and receiued to the Sacraments, is a
greater dignitie & prerogatiue, then
to bee admitted to the hearing of the
Word; and to receiue the Sacraments,
then to heare the Word. For
in receiuing the Sacraments, and in
speciall, this of the Bodie and Bloud
of our Sauiour, Christ draweth
neerer to vs, and communicateth
himselfe with vs more particularly,
familiarly, and entirely, then in preaching
of the Word, which is common
to all. In the preaching of the
Word, God dealeth coniunctly,
generally, and in common with all
at once:The Word likewise worketh seuerally. but in the Sacraments, although
the action bee publike and
common to all the Receiuers; yet
therein God dealeth not coniunctly
with all at once, but seuerally and
particularly, with euery one alone
and by himselfe. And therefore in

this action, the common and generall
reuerence and worship done to
GOD in the publike prayer and
thankesgiuing, for the common benefit
to bee receiued, wherewith the
action beginneth; and for the common
benefit that wee haue receiued,
when the action is ended; this
common and publike worship (I say)
wherewith the action beginneth
and endeth, is not sufficient. But
as the common benefit is seuerally
and particularly giuen to euery one;
so should euery one at the receiuing
thereof, doe reuerence and worship
in particular for himselfe to God and
his Sauiour, from whose hand immediately
hee receiueth the benefit.
For as the Sacramentall Word, This
is my Bodie, this is my Bloud, is generally
and in common pronounced
at the Consecration, in the audience
of all that are to receiue: And yet
at the receiuing, euery one must
esteeme, that as the Bread and the

Cup is in particular deliuered to
him, and receiued by him, so the
Word to bee spoken particularly to
him; This is my Bodie which is broken
for thee; this Cup is the new Testament
in my Bloud, that is shed for the
remission of thy sinnes: Euen so should
euery one apply, and tender vnto
Iesus Christ in particular for himselfe,
the substance of the generall
prayer and thankesgiuing that went
before; that is, hee should when hee
receiueth, wish, that by the death
of his Sauiour, whereof hee is made
partaker, himselfe may bee saued,
and that in his saluation, his Sauiour
may bee glorified. These should be,
and are the thoughts and exercises of
the minde of euery one that receiueth
worthily; for the thoughts of
the worthy Receiuers should be, and
are such as the Sacramentall Word
and Precept requireth: The Sacramentall
Word (This is my Body that
is broken for you; this Cup is the new

Testament in my Bloud, that is shed
for the remission of the sinnes of many)
requireth that euery receiuer, at the
instant when hee receiueth, do actually
beleeue, that vnto him in particular
Christ offereth himselfe, and
the new Testament confirmed by his
Bloud, containing the right of eternal
saluation; and that with his whole
heart hee embrace him, and rest on
him, hoping for that saluation, and
earnestly desiring to haue the full fruition
and possession thereof. Now
this desire, proceeding from this
faith and hope, is in effect a particular
application to our selues of the
generall prayer which went before,
wherein all desired to bee partakers
of Christ himselfe, and by him of
life eternall. Next, the Precept, Doe
this in remembrance of mee, requireth
a present actuall remembrance of the
death of Christ, which remembrance
at that time, must either bee
actually thankefull for the benefit

which hee hath receiued in Christ,
or it is actually profane and diabolicall.
And this thankefull remembrance,
or this remembrance actually
thankeful, is a particular application
of that generall Thankesgiuing
that went before to God for our own
Redemption. Now to draw all the
thoughts and exercises of the minde
together, that are required by the
Sacramentall Word and Precept,
to bee in the Receiuer, at the instant
of receiuing, are briefly, and in substance
these: I call to minde with
thankefulnesse, O Lord, thy Bodie that
was broken, and thy Bloud that was shed,
here represented and applyed to me, and
therein my soule trusteth, and waiteth
for thy saluation; wherewith possesse
mee, I beseech thee, Amen. No tongue
can vtter so briefly, as these thoughts
goe swiftly thorow the minde of
the worthy Receiuer. Eusebius, in the
sixt booke of the Ecclesiasticall Storie,
recordeth, that Nouatus, when

he deliuered the Sacrament to his
people, did apprehend their hands;
& compelled them 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     ,
in stead of blessing, to sweare by
that which was in their hands 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     ,
and to say, in stead of
Amen, Wee shall not returne to Cornelius
againe. By the which words it is
euident, that they did not onely

                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , pray and giue thankes, before
and after the receiuing, but in
the very Act it selfe, while the bread
was in their hands, they blessed it,
and said, Amen. Now with what
gesture and reuerence, I pray you,
should these thoughts and meditations
of our heart be accompanied,
at the instant, when Christ is professedly
giuing, and wee receiuing
from his hand? Thinke yee that sufficient
which is vsed, when men attend
to heare his Will declared in
his Word? If a King should generally
declare to a multitude, what benefit
hee were to bestow vpon them,

and thereafter should call them man
by man, and with his hand deliuer it;
should the carriage of euery man
comming seuerally to receiue, bee
no other then that which was vsed
of all when they harkened to his
speech?
               
               
                  SECT. 8. That the name of a Supper giuen to
this Sacrament, doth not diminish
the reuerence that is
due thereto.
                  ANd here let it bee considered,
whether this should exempt vs
from bowing the Knee, because this
gift is called a Supper, which should
not bee receiued with Kneeling. A
Supper it is called, I grant: But I
demand, Is it so called in respect of
the nature of the action, simply considered
in it selfe, and properly? Chrysostome
                     
saith, that Paul in 1. Cor. 11. calleth
that a Supper, which should rather
haue beene called 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , a Dinner,
or a breake-fast, if hee had respected
the time: but hee calleth it
so, Vt remitteret illos iam inde, ad illam
vesperam qua Dominus tremenda
mysteria tradidit, That hee might
send them back to that euening,
wherein our Lord deliuered these
fearefull mysteries. The meaning is,
that hee might call them to remembrance
of the first institution; In respect
whereof, it is called a Supper:
So likewise it is called a Supper, because
in some thing it resembleth a
Supper: For it is not a priuate meale,
but like to a publike banquet, wherevnto
all the faithful are inuited. Now
we finde that in these dayes men vsed
to dine priuately, and their feasts
whereunto they inuited their friends
were commonly suppers made at
night. Vnto this agreeth well that
which Plutarch writeth; The Supper,

saith hee, was called by the Romans,
Coena, ob 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , because it was common:
for the old Romanes vsed to
dine sparingly, but to sup with their
friends. And finally, it is called a
Supper, because it is the Antitype of
the Paschall Supper, as Baptisme is
of Circumcision; in respect whereof,
the spirituall part of Baptisme is
called by the Apostle, Coloss. 2. 11, 12.
The Circumcision of Christ, as this Sacrament
is called the Supper of the
Lord.
                  That properly it is not, nor cannot
be called a Supper, whether wee
consider the symbolicall, or the spirituall
part thereof, is manifest by
these Reasons:
                  First, euery Repast that is properly
called a Supper, is (at least) sufficient
to content Nature: Amongst
the Ancients, although their Dinners
and Breake fasts were sparing,
and therefore the Custome was not,
either to sit or lie at them; yet their

Suppers were large, and a long time
spent at them, which made them to
Lie or Sit for ease of their bodies.
Of this sort was the Paschall Supper,
and all the Feasts wherein the
Legall Sacrifices were eaten: Here
all the meate is a little morsell of
bread, no greater then an Oliue, and
all the drinke a little quantitie, rather
tasted then drunken. Such a
shew of Repast as this, can neither
properly bee called a Breake-fast, a
Dinner, nor a Supper, and the
time spent in taking heereof, so short,
that easily it may bee past with any
position of bodie, as was said
before.
                  Secondly, the Feasters here take
not, nor eate not, as at an ordinarie
supper: all that they eate, or
drinke, they receiue at the hand of
the Pastor, all their meate at once
and together. This kinde of intertainement
is not proper to a supper.
                  Thirdly, at the deliuery and receiuing

of this food, a word is pronounced,
whereby wee are taught,
that this food is not giuen, nor
should bee receiued to nourish the
body, but onely to signifie and represent
the Passion of Christ, and
the application thereof to the Beleeuers,
for their comfort. A food
giuen and receiued for such an vse as
this onely, cannot properly bee a
Supper; for no Repast properly is a
supper, but that which is appointed
to nourish the bodie, whatsoeuer
vse it hath beside. So if either wee
consider the quantitie of the Repast,
the time that is spent in the receiuing
thereof, the forme of giuing and
receiuing, or the end wherefore it is
giuen, wee shall finde, that properly,
neither is it, nor can it bee called
a Supper.
                  As for the spirituall and internall
part of the action, whereby the
minde is informed, and faith confirmed,
it may be called a Supper;

not properly, but in the sense that
Salomon calleth a good conscience, a perpetuall
Feast, because by the meditation
of the death of Christ, and
the benefit that we haue thereby, the
soule is fed and nourished with spirituall
and heauenly knowledge,
strengthened with confidence and
hope, and satiate with ioyes and
pleasures that cannot bee expressed:
Whereby it is euident, that neither
in respect of the externall and materiall
part, nor in respect of the inward
and spirituall part, is this Sacrament
properly called a Supper.
Therefore the appellation should
not alter the worship, and religious
reuerence, that the nature of the action,
simply considered in it selfe, requireth.
                  But put the case, that it were properly
a Supper, yet wee must grant
that the Master of the Feast, is our
Lord and King, out of whose hand
if wee receiue the Cup, or some

daintie morsell, should wee vse no
more reuerence, then when we carue
to our selues, or receiue from the
hand of a seruant, or from our companions?
Consider then with your
selues, how this whole Supper, to
wit, the Bodie and the Bloud of
Christ, is giuen by Christ himselfe
at once to vs, his Bloud in one Cup,
and his Bodie in one Morsell. So
that 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     ,
The Lords Supper is a Gift, or a
Iewell giuen out of his owne hand,
as a pledge of his loue, and therefore
is sometimes called by the Fathers,

                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     . Basilius writeth
in his Homily of Charitie, that
Christ left to his Disciples, when he
was to fulfill his Ministerie in the
flesh, 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , Donum perfectitium,
a gift giuen at his departure,
in pledge of his loue. Then to conclude,
this Supper being a Gift giuen
in pledge of his loue to vs, by him
who not onely is our Lord and King,

but the King of Kings, and the Lord
of Lords. Whether should we draw
neere and receiue, in respect of the
testification of his loue towards vs,
with greater confidence? Or in consideration
of his glorious Person
and Maiestie, with greater feare and
reuerence? Doubtlesse, both should
be so great as great may bee: How
great then must the Religion and
Deuotion bee, that is composed of
these two, the greatest confidence,
and the greatest reuerence?
               
               
                  SECT. 9. What manner of person should wee
esteeme our Sautour and our selues, to
carry at the Sacrament.
                  LO, but Christ inuiteth vs as coheires
to this Banquet, whom hee
will honour as his owne Peeres and
Equals, and will not haue vs to demeane
our selues, as Inferiours and

Subiects: Whence learne wee this:
Christ Sate, or Lay, at the Table with
his Disciples, when hee deliuered his
Bodie and Bloud to them: and therefore
now, why should wee not sit
at Table with him, and receiue from
his hand? I answer, Christ Sate or
Lay with his Disciples, when he did
institute this Sacrament, so did hee
at the same time wash their feete.
Two Reasons hereof are giuen by
himselfe: Hee came not to bee serued,
but to serue: and therefore during
the dayes of his flesh, as hee
did carrie the forme of a seruant, so
hee saith, that hee was as a seruant
in the midst of them. Next, hee did
giue to them an example of humilitie,
that they should neither rule imperiously,
one ouer another, nor
ouer the Lords inheritance, but in
humilitie serue one another, and feed
the Flocke committed to their
charge. This last Reason would neither
teach them, nor vs, to match

our selues with our Lord & Master,
but to submit our selues to our equals.
The first sheweth, that as in
the rest of the parts of his Ministerie;
so in the institution of this Sacrament,
although hee was the Lord
and Giuer of the inward and spirituall
grace, yet hee did carry himselfe
as the Minister of the externall
Element, which person now the
Pastor sustaineth: and hee exalted
at the right hand of the Father, hath
declared himselfe to haue laid down
the person of a seruant, and to bee
no more an externall Minister, but
the Lord and Giuer of the Spirit,
and inward grace, by sending down
the Holy Ghost from heauen vpon
the Apostles. Hee then, who now
would sit with him, as his fellow,
must either bring him downe from
heauen, and abase him againe in the
forme of a seruant; or else hee must
exalt himselfe to Sit with him, at the
right hand of the Throne of Maiesty

in the highest places. Therefore let
no man in this action thinke and
esteeme of the Lord Iesus, according
to the condition of the person that
hee sustained, and the carriage that
hee vsed, when hee did institute this
Sacrament. The true and right estimation
of him, is to be learned, without
question, from the doctrine and
word of the institution. Let vs then
take diligent heed, and marke how
there hee is propounded to be considered
and esteemed of vs. There
hee is the great High Priest, and Sacrificer
of himselfe (Hee tooke, Hee
brake) wee are the sinners for whom
the Sacrifice is offered; with this Sacrifice
hee payeth his Vowes,Psal. 22. 25. in the
midst of the vniuersall Church (Take
yee,
                     Psal. 22. 26. 
                     eate yee:) Wee are the poore
and hungry that eate and are satisfied.
Hee is the Mediator, Suretie,
and Testator of the new and eternall
Testament (This is the new Testament
in my Bloud.) VVee are the

Heires and Legators, who haue neither
right by Nature, nor Merit,
but by his meere Donation and Disposition
onely. Hee is the honourable
and glorious person, who in this
action is to bee remembred as the
Authour of eternall saluation, (Doe
this in remembrance of mee:) And we
are the redeemed, who for the benefit
of our redemption should remember
him with Thankesgiuing and
Praise.
                  Thus wee are taught by the words
of the Institution, how in this action
wee should esteeme, both of him,
and of our selues, and how therein
accordingly wee should behaue our
selues towards him: Namely, as the
redeemed, towards their Redeemer:
the poore and the hungry, towards
their Nourisher and Feeder: The
adopted heire, towards their Adopter
and Testator; and they who
should giue thankes and praise, towards
their Benefactor.
               
               
                  
                  SECT. 10. In what respect this Sacrament is
called the Eucharist.
                  AND heere we rancounter with
the other end of this Sacrament,
which I called the praise of the glorious
grace of God, and of our Sauiour
the Lord Iesus. In respect of
this end it is a commemoration and
predication of the death of Christ,
acted not in word onely, but in deed,
both by the Pastor and the people:
By the Pastor, when hee representeth
Christs death in the mysticall
action, and by the Sacramentall
word maketh the donation and application
thereof to the people, taking,
breaking, giuing, and saying;
This is my Bodie, this is my Bloud; and
by the people, when they take, eate,
and drinke: in doing whereof they
expose in open view to the eyes of

the world, the Passion and Death
of the Lord Iesus, and the benefit
that therby they acknowledge themselues
to receiue, and so doth publikely
and solemnely remember his
goodnesse and grace to his praise
and glorie, and testifie that their
faith and thankefulnes towards him,
according to the direction of our Sauiour,
Doe this in remembrance of me▪
                     
In the which precept wee are commanded;
first, to celebrate the action
as hee hath done: and secondly,
we are admonished of the end wherfore
that celebritie should be obserued;
namely, that thereby a solemne
memoriall of his death ought to bee
kept. So Paul interpreteth the Precept
in these words immediately subioyned;
For so often as yee eate this
Bread, and drinke this Cup; that is, so
often as yee doe this, yee shew forth,
or shall shew forth, and preach the
Lords death till hee come: (that is, yee
shall doe it in remembrance of me.)

Hereby shewing and preaching the
Lords death: The Apostle meaneth
not a verball Sermon, or a preaching
made by word in the Congregation,
for that wee know is not the part of
the people, whereof here hee speaketh;
but a reall preaching, acted
by the people for their part, by taking,
eating, and drinking; and
therefore the Apostle saith, that if
they eate and drinke vnworthily, they
shall be guiltie of the Lords Bodie.
The reason is, because by eating and
drinking vnworthily, they shew forth
& preach the Lords death vnworthily;
that is, without the reuerence and
respect that the worthinesse of his
death deserueth: for if they eate and
drinke like full and drunken persons,
their preaching is profane and vitious;
if they eate and drinke with
contempt of the Church, and despising
of the poore, their preaching
is disdainefull, and ignominious to
Christ and his Church. This was

the Corinthians fault, who did abuse
this sacred memoriall of the Lords
death to his dishonour and disgrace,
because therein looking too basely
on the elements, they did not discerne,
by their religious reuerence
and carriage, the Body of the Lord,
from other common food: wherefore
the Apostle exhorteth them to
try and refine themselues from the
drosse of the old man; their pride,
their profanenesse, their drunkennes
and contentions, and so eate of that
Bread, and drinke of that Cup: otherwise,
if they should eate and drinke
vnworthily, that is, without a due
regard to him, who, for a glorious
remembrance of himselfe till his
comming againe, did institute this
action, they should eate and drinke
damnation to themselues. This action
then, as it is, in respect of the end
that belongeth to vs, the communion
of the Bodie and Bloud of
Christ, or the instrument and seale

of that communion: so in respect of
this end that appertaineth to Christ
himselfe, and of our dutie that
should be performed therein to him,
it is a solemne memoriall, or 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     
of his death, ordained to bee
obserued for the praise of his grace;
and therefore by the ancient and recent
VVriters and Doctors of the
Church, is rightly called the Eucharist,
not onely for the thankes-giuing,
wherewith it beginneth, and which
the Church is accustomed to giue
after it is ended, which is common
to many other religious actions, but
because the very action it selfe is so
to bee esteemed, by reason of the
end whereunto it is appointed, from
the which commonly actions receiue
their nature and their name, and
therefore 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , a worthy
and an honorable remembrance
of Christ, being one of the chiefe
end
                        •
                      of this action. The action it
selfe is 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , an action of praise,

in respect of Christ, for whom it is
done; and 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , an action of
thankesgiuing, in respect of these by
whom it is done: for as it is a memoriall
of his praise, so is it a testimonie
of their thankefulnesse. And
what is a thankesgiuing, but the remembrance
and declaration of benefits
receiued, made and intended
to the praise of the giuer, whether
it bee performed in word, in deed, or
in both? For thankesgiuing in word,
reade all the Psalmes and Orations
in the Scripture, conceiued for that
effect, and yee shall finde it so, Psal.
135. 126. 1. Chron. 17. 29, 10, &c. The
Passeouer, and all the rest of the
Feasts kept vnder the Law, in remembrance
of some great and extraordinarie
benefits of God, were Eucharisticall,
because they were obserued
to the praise and honor of God, not
verbally, but really. Such amongst
the Heathen, were the Olympick, Pythick,
and Isthmick games, wherein

the prayses and honour of their gods
were remembred and celebrated, not
by Speeches and Orations, but by
the very Actions and Deedes of the
Gamesters. So Virgil hauing recorded
the Pastimes, and Games that
Aeneas caused to bee acted to the
prayse of his father Anchyses, concludeth,
Hac celebrata tenus sancto
certamina patri; hitherto the pastimes
were celebrated to the praise of his
holy Father. And heere it is to bee
obserued, that although in these superstitious
solemnities, no mention
were made of their praises and honours
for whom they were kept,
yet they are remembrances of their
praise, because they were instituted,
and ex professo, professedy obserued
for that purpose. In the religious
Festiuities, some resemblance there
was of the benefit that was remembred,
beside the profession of the
end wherefore they were instituted
and kept. But amongst all the Celebrities

and Solemnities, that euer
were obserued for the praise of God
or man, there was neuer any that
had the end wherefore it was instituted,
set downe more cleerely to bee
a memoriall of praise, or an honourable
remembrance, then this Sacrament
hath in these words, (Doe
this for a remembrance of me,) and
that had a more euident and plaine
resemblance of the benefit that was
to bee remembred with praise and
thankesgiuing, then this. For what
can more liuely expresse the praise of
the glory of our Sauiours grace,
then that part of this action, where
hee is brought in, breaking his owne
Bodie, and sheading his owne Bloud,
and offering himselfe in a sacrifice
for the sinnes of the world? And
againe, what can more euidently
declare the faith and thankefulnesse
of the people towards him, then the
other part of the same action, where
they are brought in, feeding on the

sacrifice of his Bodie and Bloud,
thereby testifying before the world,
that by him alone they doe acknowledge
themselues to haue liberty and
life, that in him alone they repose
and trust, that hee alone is the meditation
of their minds, the desire of
their soules, the ioy and delectation
of their hearts. Caluin. Instit. lib. 4.
Cap. 18. Sect. 17. Huius generis sacrificio
carere non potest coena Domini, in
qua dum mortem eius annunciamus, &
gratiarum actionem referimus, nihil
aliud offerimus quam sacrificium laudis.
Aquinas Quotiescunque ederitis panem
hunc, &c. Exponit verba Domini,
Hoc facite in meam commemorationem:
dicens mortem Domini, annunciabitis
represent ando, scilicet eam per hoc Sacramentum.
Caluin saith, that the Supper
of the Lord cannot want in it an
Eucharisticall Sacrifice, because,
while wee declare the death of the
Lord, and giue thankes, we doe nothing,
but offer vp a sacrifice of

praise. Aquinas affirmeth, that wee
declare and preach Christs death, representing
it by this Sacrament. In
diuers places of the Greek Liturgies
this Sacrament is called 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     ,
the sacrifice of praise; and not onely
is the action it selfe, and the celebration
of this Sacrament, called the
Eucharist by the Ancients, but the
Symbols themselues, the Bread and
the Wine. Origen contra Celsum,
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , the Bread,
which is called the Eucharist, saith
hee, is a Symboll of our thankefulnesse
to God, and so is the whole
action in deed, because not onely
in it are thankes giuen in word, Sed
gratiae aguntur vere & re-ipsa, but a
solemne thankesgiuing is acted truly
and in deed.
               
               
                  
                  SECT. 11. The conclusion of this point, which
concerneth the nature of this
Sacrament.
                  HEreby it is manifest, that as
this action, in respect of Christs
part towards vs, or the end that concerneth
vs, is a Mysticall representation,
and a reall application of the
Propitiatorie sacrifice of Christ to
vs: So in respect of our part towards
Christ againe, and the end
                        •
                      that
concerneth him, it is a spirituall and
Eucharisticall Sacrifice done to his
glorie. Nay, if we consider the action,
in regard of the one end, or the
other, it is to bee performed of vs
with such a religious and humble
gesture, as becommeth sinners to vse
towards their Sauiour when they receiue
from him the benefit of expiation
of their sinnes, and reconciliation

with God. Or when they offer
back againe to him therefore, the
sacrifice of thankesgiuing, both secretly
in their inward affection, and
publikely in a most solemne action.
Now, what gesture can better agree
to sinners in receiuing their pardon,
and in giuing praise therefore to
their Redeemer, then the religious
and humble gesture of Kneeling,
commanded by God himselfe to bee
vsed in his worship; practised by our
Sauiour himselfe; and by all the
Saints both vnder the Law and the
Gospell, not onely when they did
offer their supplications to God, but
when they ioyfully gaue thankes and
praise? Psal. 138. I will praise thee with
my whole heart; before the Gods I will
sing praise vnto thee, I will bowe my selfe
Eshtachaue towards thy holy Temple,
and praise thy name for thy louing kindnesse.
Psal. 95. O come, let vs sing vnto
the Lord, let vs make a ioyfull noyse
to the Rocke of our saluation: let vs come

before his presence with thankesgiuing,
and make a ioyfull noyse to him with
Psalmes, &c. ver. 6. O come, let vs humbly
bowe our selues, and fall downe, and
Kneele before the Lord our Maker.
Luk. 17. 16. When one of the ten
Lepers perceiued that hee was healed,
hee returned with a loud voyce,
giuing glory to God, and fell on his
face at the feete of Iesus 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     ,
giuing thankes to him. In the Apocalypse
the 24. Elders, when they
giue praise, and sing a new song to
their Sauiour, not onely fall they
downe off the Thrones, whereon he
had placed them, but they cast the
Crownes off their heads, the ensignes
of the Kingdome that he had disposed
to them; thereby teaching how
basely wee should esteeme of our
selues, and how highly wee should
thinke of our Sauiour, and with what
gesture and carriage wee should expresse
the same, when wee come
with thankesgiuing and praise, to

worship him, as wee should all professe
our selues to doe in this action.
In this point I haue beene forced to
bee somewhat larger, because there
is one, who to maintaine his Thesis
for Sitting, against Kneeling, bendeth
& spendeth all his wit in vaine,
to proue that this Sacrament should
not, nor can not bee called the Eucharist,
against the sway of all
the Learned, both in the Orient
and Occident Church; so audacious
is 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      the passing-measure-loue
of contention, who regardeth
not to tread on the Veritie,
prouiding she may seeme to haue
the Victorie. Dij talem terris auertite
pestem: From the which pestilent
Monster, the Lord deliuer his
Church. Amen.
                  
               
            
            
               
               CHAP. IIII. Whether it may stand with Charitie
towards our Brethren, to
Kneele at the receiuing
of the Sacrament.
               
                  SECT. 1. That Kneeling serueth for
Edification.
                  
                     THE last thing that wee
haue to try, is, whether
the gesture of Kneeling
in receiuing the Sacrament,
bee according to charitie:
that is, whether it may tend to Edification,
or at least, may be vsed without
offence and scandall in our
Church. As for the first; The chiefe

things whereof the Church should
be informed at the receiuing of the
Sacrament, are the spirituall benefits,
that are mystically shadowed
in the symbolicall Elements; as
Christ, the Giuer; his Body and his
Bloud, the Gift; the spirituall appetite,
wherewith wee should come;
faith, the hand wherewith we should
receiue; the nature of the action it
selfe, a mysticall representation, and
a reall application of Christs propitiatory
Sacrifice for vs; and an Oblation
againe made by vs of an Eucharisticall
Sacrifice for him; and
the end of the action our saluation,
and the glory of our Sauiour. These
things being the chiefe points wherein
the Communicants should bee
edified: What gesture for their edification
can bee chosen and vsed
more conuenient, then Kneeling?
A Gesture, declaring what reuerence
is due to the Giuer, and the Gift: A
Gesture, agreeable to the spirituall

appetite and desire, wherewith the
poore and hungry should come to
this Table: proper to the humilitie,
that in this action our faith should
produce, when it learneth vs to
renounce our selues, and rest on
Christ; and very decent to be vsed
by the Saints, when either they receiue
benefits from Gods hands, or
giue backe thankes to him therefore.
               
               
                  SECT. 2. That Kneeling obscureth not our fellowship
with Christ and amongst
our selues.
                  AGainst this, if it be obiected
that although in the respects
aboue specified, it may serue for edification,
yet it obscureth the fellowship
and communion that wee haue
with Christ, and amongst our selues,
that is signified, and sealed vp in

this Sacrament, and is most cleerely
expressed by Sitting at Table. It
is answered, As for our fellowship
amongst our selues, if at the Table
an vniforme gesture bee obserued by
all the Communicants, whether it be
Standing, or Lying, or Sitting, or
Kneeling, if it be the same, and vniforme,
I say, it is sufficient to expresse
our Societie, at least, it obscureth
it not: For there is as well a fellowship
amongst the Saints in Kneeling,
as in Sitting or Standing. As
for our fellowship and communion
with Christ, wherein our honour
in deed, and Christian prerogatiues
consist, if wee imagine that to bee
represented by our Sitting at Table
with our Sauiour; How was it
expressed, when the Communicants
stood at the Table, except yee thinke
that Christ stood with them? for if
hee sate and they stood, they were
not vsed as his Coheires & Equals,
as some affirme wee should bee: but

there was a disparitie as great, as is
betwixt the Lord that sitteth, and
the seruant that standeth. And if
our Sauiour, the Lord Iesus, be neither
locally nor corporally with vs at
Table now (as was before cleered)
if hee be neither there Standing, nor
Sitting, nor Lying, as hee was with
his Disciples: How can our Sitting
at Table import our fellowship with
him more then Kneeling, or any
other gesture?
                  If it be said, that the Pastor representeth
him in the action, and that
our Sitting with the Pastor sheweth
our fellowship with Christ:
                  It is answered, that Christ had two
conditions of estate: The forme of
a seruant, and the authoritie and
power of a Lord:Ioh. 13. 13. 
                     Yee call me Lord
and Master (saith hee) and I am so,
yet I am as a seruant in the midst of
you:
                     Luk. 22. 27. the one in open view hee did
carry; the other hee had but hid in
the forme of a seruant: By his power

and authoritie, as Lord, hee did institute
this Sacrament, and was, and
is Lord and Master of the Feast, and
the spirituall Giuer of the internall
and inuisible Grace. In the forme
of a seruant, hee lay with his Disciples,
and they with him at Table,
and hee was Minister of the externall
element. This person our Sauiour
hath laid downe, and sustaineth onely
that of Lord and Master, had
while hee was on earth, but manifest
in heauen; which neither man nor
Angell carrieth, but himselfe at the
right hand of the Father. With
that other of a Seruant and Minister,
the Pastor is cloathed, wherein hee
standeth and serueth in the Congregation,
and sitteth not as Lord and
Master of the Feast. Our Sitting
therefore with him, or Standing at
the Table, cannot declare our prerogatiue,
and honourable fellowship
that we haue with the Lord and Master
of the Feast, our Sauiour Christ

Iesus, whom to esteeme now as a
seruant, either in this, or any other
Religious action, and vs as his fellowes,
let bee his equals (which is
blasphemy) is pride in vs, and contempt
of him. Hee is our Lord and
God, as Thomas said, and him wee
must adore, as the Apostles did euer
after his Ascension.
               
               
                  SECT. 3. That by eating and drinking, our fellowship
with Christ is sufficiently
expressed, without the Table-gesture
of Sitting.
                  THE true fellowship, vnion and
communion that wee haue with
our Sauiour and amongst our selues,
is in this Sacrament both wrought
and represented, not by Sitting, nor
Lying, nor Standing, nor Kneeling,
but by a farre more significant and

effectuall meane, not drawne from
a controuerted example of Christs
Table-gesture, but set downe in the
expresse words of the Institution, and
interpreted by Paul, 1. Cor. chap. 10. in
these words following: The bread
which wee breake (not the Table
whereat wee sit) is it not the communion
of the Bodie of Christ? The Cup of
blessing which wee blesse (not our Sitting
or Standing) is it not the communion
of the Bloud of Christ? Here the
Bread and the Cup deliuered and
receiued, and not the Table, nor the
Sitting thereat, are the Signes and
Seales of our Communion and Fellowship
with Christ; yea, a signe that
declareth a far more strict coniunction
with Christ, then either Lying or
Sitting, or any other Table-gesture,
to wit, such a coniunction and vnion,
as is betwixt the bodie, and the food
wherewith it is nourished, which is
not onely locall, but reall: For as
our corporall nourishment is turned

into the substance of our bodies naturally,
so are we conuerted and turned
into the Lord Iesus spiritually,
insomuch that wee become flesh of
his flesh, and bone of his bones;
and this conuersion beginneth in this
life at the soule, and is perfected
both in bodie and soule in the life to
come. Here wee are conuerted in
the same minde, will, and affections,
then, our bodies shall bee made like
his glorious Bodie. And this conuersion
is wrought by the reall vnion
that is betwixt our Sauiour and vs,
represented in this Sacrament, by
the naturall vnion, that is betwixt
the bodie that is nourished, and the
food whereby it is nourished, and is
most cleerely set downe by our Sauiour
himselfe in the sixt chapter of
Iohns Gospell, wherein the spirituall
part of this Sacrament is most accurately
described, containing both
the benefit which wee receiue, and
the meanes and manner whereby we

receiue it. The benefit, the resurrection
of our bodies, and life euerlasting,Ioh. 6. 54.
in these words, Hee that eateth
my Flesh, and drinketh my Bloud,
hath life eternall, and I shall raise him
vp at the last Day. The meanes and
manner, whereby wee receiue this
benefit, is our vnion and communion
with Christ; and touching the
vnion, hee saith,Ioh. 6. 56. 
                     Hee that eateth my
Flesh, and drinketh my Bloud, remaineth
in me, and I in him. Then followeth
the communion;Ioh. 6. 57. 
                     As the Father
liueth, so liue I by the Father, and hee
that eateth mee, shall liue by mee. Here
we haue a fellowship with the Father
and with the Sonne, in the greatest
dignitie and honour whereof a creature
can be capable, in the blessed, the
eternall, and glorious life of God,
which is signified & sealed vp by the
Sacramentall action of eating and
drinking the Bread and the Cup of
the Lord liuely, then any gesture, or
position of body can expresse.
               
               
                  
                  SECT. 4. So likewise our fellowship amongst our
selues is expressed sufficiently, by
eating the same Bread in
the Sacrament.
                  AND thus much for our fellowship
& communion with Christ:
Our communion and fellowship amongst
our selues, is in the same
place of the Epistle to the Corinths,
most euidently, not shadowed, but
demonstrated in these words:1. Cor. 10. 17. 
                     Because
the Bread is one, wee many are
one Bodie; for we are all partakers of one
Bread. Cyprian in the sixt Epistle of
his first booke, thinketh that our vnion
amongst our selues is onely declared
by this similitude; As many
graines are made one Bread, and many
grapes one Vine: so the Church, that is
a multitude of people, is made one spirituall
Bodie. But the Apostles reason

is demonstratiue, the ground whereof
is, that the Bread is one, whereof
wee are all made partakers: one, not
in forme and kinde onely; for so many
persons and bodies may bee fed
with one bread; but one bread in
number, and therefore all that feed
thereon, must bee one bodie:
for two bodie in number cannot
feed on the selfe-same bread in number;
the bread that I eate, cannot
feed thee; and the same bread in
number that thou eatest, cannot feed
mee. It is one bread in number that
feedeth thee, and another bread in
number that feedeth me: but all the
members of my body that are many,
are fed with one and the selfe-same
bread, that I receiue and eate; and
therefore although they bee many,
yet are they all but one bodie. Euen
so all the members of the Church
which are many, are fed with one and
the selfe-same Bread in number, that
is Christ, and therefore they must

all bee one Bodie. This is a demonstration
of the cause by the effect: It
is the proper effect or affection of
one bodie, to be fed with one bread,
and therefore to whomsoeuer this
effect agreeth, they are one body:
And contrariwise, the vnitie of the
body, or the vnion of the members
in one body by one forme, as the
immediate and proper cause, that all
these diuers mēbers are fed with one
bread. As this therefore is a demonstration
of the effect by the cause, all
that are one body, feed on one bread:
All the members of the Church, are
one Bodie; Ergo, all the members of
the Church feed on one Bread. So
this is a demonstratiō of the cause by
the effect: Al that feed on one Bread,
are one Bodie; all the members of
the Church feed on one Bread,
therefore all the members of the
Church are one Bodie. Here you
may perceiue the ground of the reason
to bee, that the Bread whereof

all are partakers is One: And this is
manifest, whether by the bread, the
signe, or the thing signified bee vnderstood;
for if by the Bread, the
elementall bread bee vnderstood, although
that materially it bee diuided
in many parts, and distributed,
yet all these parts and pieces are formally
one and the selfe-same Sacrament.
So that, although thou receiue
not the selfe-same piece of bread in
number, which I receiue; yet thou,
and I, and all of vs receiue the selfe-same
Sacrament in number. But if
by the Bread, the Bodie of Christ,
which is the Bread of life, be vnderstood,
as principally and chiefly it
must, seeing the Bread which wee
breake, is (as the Apostle saith) the
communion of Christs Bodie, which
we participate in breaking of the Sacramentall
Bread: then the ground
of the demonstration is strong and
sure, That the bread is one in number
whereof wee are all partakers, because

the Bodie of Christ is not diuided,
and giuen by pieces, but is
all and whole, one and the same in
number, giuen to all and euery one
that worthily receiueth. As for the
breaking of the elementall bread, it
signifieth not the distribution of the
Bodie of Christ by pieces, but the
breaking of his Body on the Crosse,
with the sorrowes of death for our
sinnes. And here marke by the way,
that 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      doth not alway signifie
to receiue with others by parts; for
if the thing be such as cannot be diuided,
then it doth signifie the same
that 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , to receiue in common
with others: So in the third chapter
to the Hebrews, ver. 1. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     ,
and vers. 14. 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     ,
the participation of Christ, & of the
heauenly Calling, importeth not a
diuision of Christ, and of the heauenly
Calling, whereof wee are partakers,
but a communion of Christ,
and of the heauenly Calling. And

so in this place 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      signifieth
to receiue, not by parts, but in
common with others, the selfe-same
Bread of life in number, to wit, the
Bodie of the Lord Iesus Christ, and the
selfe-same Sacrament thereof in number;
whereon it followeth most necessarily;
that wee who are partakers
of that Bread, must bee one Bodie.
Here contention being laid aside, I
would demand, whether the Sacramentall
elements, and actions that
are vsed about them, do not sufficiently
and fully declare our communion
with Christ and amongst our
selues, or need they any accessarie
gesture to supply their defects: For
is there, or was there euer any gesture,
that can signifie so straite a coniunction,
as is represented in this Sacrament?
First, betwixt Christ and
vs; and next amongst our selues, by
the participation of that one and
selfe-same Bread, which first sheweth
the vnion betwixt Christ & vs to

be such, as is betwixt the body and
the food whereby it is nourished: and
next, the vnion amongst our selues to
bee such, as is amongst the members
of the same body.
               
               
                  SECT. 5. That Sitting cannot bee a necessarie
Sacramentall Ceremonie,
nor a proper Table-gesture.
                  NOW to conclude this point
(as I said before) that all the
Ceremonies and Actions, that either
appertaine to the Essence or Integrity
of the Sacrament, are fully
set downe in the words of the Institution:
So here I affirme, that all the
significant Ceremonies and Actions
that belong to the nature of the Sacraments,
are employed about the
Elements, or belong to the vse of

them onely. As in Baptisme, the
washing, dipping, and rising vp, are
Actions and Ceremonies that belong
to the vse of the water. In the
Supper, the taking, blessing, and breaking,
giuing, receiuing, eating, and
drinking, are Ceremonies and Actions
vsed about the Bread and the
Wine: And the reason is manifest,
because by the Elements onely, our
Sauiour Christ and his benefits are
signified; and by the Ceremonies
and Actions, the application of him
to vs, and our faith in him: as, by
the Water, his Spirit; his Bloud, his
Death; by the washing, dipping,
and rising vp out of the water, the
cleansing of vs from the guilt and vitiositie
of sinne; by his bloud and
Spirit, the participation of his death
and buriall whereby wee die to sin;
and of his resurrection, whereby we
rise to newnesse of life: So likewise
in the Supper, the bread and the
cup signifie, his Bodie and Bloud;

the Ceremoniall Actions represent
his Passion, and the application
thereof to vs; and in both, our obedience
testifieth our faith. Whereby
it is manifest, that if wee count the
Table-gesture a Sacramentall Ceremonie,
the Table, whereunto the
vse of the gesture belongeth, must
also be some third symboll or signe
representing Christ; and consequently
as necessarie and essentiall to the
action, as the elements of bread and
wine, and the gesture that is proper
thereto (if any be) as necessary to
bee obserued, as the Ceremoniall
Actions of eating and drinking, are
necessarie to be vsed in receiuing the
Elements. But this I am perswaded
no man will affirme, neither will any
man thinke, that a materiall Table is
so necessarie, that without it, the Sacrament
could not be ministred, at
least, in places where it might not
be had, as in the Wildernesse, in
Dennes and Caues of the earth, and

such like places, whereunto the
Saints were forced to flye in the
dayes of persecution. And what shall
we say of those, who receiue the Sacrament
lying sick on their beds? Of
him who in prison and fetters, made
his brest the boord? If by the mercie
of God, the Turkes were conuerted
to the Christian faith, might they
not receiue the Sacrament without
any such Table as they do their common
food, sitting on the ground?
The thing that apparantly fostereth
this conceit of Table-gesture, is this;
Where mention is made of receiuing
meate, there commonly mention
is made of a Table, and that we
conceit to be a materiall one, such
as in vse with vs: but mensa, albeit
most frequently it be so taken, yet it
is also vsed for that, whatsoeuer it
be, whereon meate is set, whether it
be a boord, or the bare earth, or the
grasse, or a cake of bread laid on the
ground vnder the meat, which some

for hunger hauing eaten, said merrily,
they had deuoured the Table:
Heus etiam mensas consumimus, inquit
Iulus. And the meate it selfe is often
called a Table, as in the Psal. 78.
Can God prepare a Table for vs in the
Wildernesse? When the Troians lay
on the grasse, fusique per herbam, and
were satiate, it is said that the boords
were remoued, mensaeque remotae; that
is, the rest of the meate was taken
away. And children know, that the
second seruice is called, Mensae secundae:
Nec adhuc mensa secunda venit.
Here with one stroke it were possible
(if it might stand with the fauour
of good brethren) to cut this Gordian
knot of Table-gesture, if wee
should onely deny, that any Table is
absolutely necessarie to bee vsed in
the Sacrament, but that which the
Apostle calleth,1. Cor. 10. 21. the Table of the Lord,
that is, the Body of our Sauiour represented
and offered in the visible
elements, or any Table-gesture necessary,

but that which hee calleth

                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , to participate of that Table
by eating and drinking: which gesture
is prescribed in the Institution,
and must be vsed, and is not onely
proper to the Lords Table, but to all
Tables of Repast; as for sitting, lying,
and standing, there be none of these
proper: for neither hath any of them
been, or shall be euer in vse amongst
all people, or only in vse at a Table of
Repast: for men sit often else-where,
& not at such a Table; & lie to sleep,
and stand at other businesse. Nay,
none of these gestures are proper, &
necessary: but as for taking, eating
and drinking, not onely are they necessary
and proper to all Tables of
Repast, but are more significant, and
do farre better expresse both our fellowship
and vnion with our Sauiour
and amongst our selues, then the gesture
of Sitting, or any other position
of body whatsoeuer.
               
               
                  
                  SECT. 6. That by Kneeling wee symbolize not
with the Papists in Idolatry.
                  NOW to proceed, and come
to the Scandall and Offence,
that may be giuen to our Church by
Kneeling at the Sacrament, as is alledged:
The greatest that I heare
of, is this, that in Kneeling we symbolize
with the Papists. So doe wee
in the place; they receiue in a Temple,
so doe wee: In the time; they receiue
on the Sabbath, and so do we:
In the order; they receiue before
meate, and so do we: In habite, for
they receiue with their heads vncouered,
and so doe we. And heere
wee remember not that wee symbolize
with the late Arrians in Sitting,
who to testifie that they beleeue not
our Sauiour to be God, but a meere
Man, will not receiue Kneeling, but

Sitting, lest that they should seeme to
adore him as God. Against them
therefore this conclusion is set down.
Petro Couiensi Synodo generali, which
is in number the fourth: De ceremoniis
Coenae Dominicae; the tenor whereof
is this: Proinde ceremonias libertati
Christianae donamus, & permittimus,
vt stantes, vel genua flectentes,
pij Sacramentum corporis & sanguinis
Christi sumant: Sessionis vero ad mensam
Domini, quia praeter ritus in omnibus
per Europam Ecclesijs vulgo consuetas,
illi inter nos primi authores extiterunt,
qui omnia in Ecclesijs temere
immutantes, à nobis ad Arrianismum
transfugae facti sunt, &c. Quare hanc
propriam ipsis vt Christum, ita sacra
eius irreuerenter tractantibus, & tanquam
minus honestam & religiosam,
simplicioribusque admodum scandolosam
ceremoniam reijcimus. Here Sitting
is discharged at the Sacrament
of the Supper, as a gesture proper to
Arrians. Now as in Sitting, though

wee symbolize with the Arrians, yet
did wee neuer (blessed be God) symbolize
with them in Arrianisme, because
we haue beleeued and professed
that Iesus Christ is God ouer all,
blessed for euer. This faith and profession
hath exempted vs from symbolizing
with them in Arrianisme,
howbeit that in times, places, gestures
and orders, we haue had a conformitie.
For it is impossible that in euery
thing, the true Church can bee disconforme
to Heretikes, who hold
many Truthes with her, and Ceremonies.
So do we not symbolize
with Papists in Papistry▪ Superstition
and Idolatry, when wee Kneele at the
Sacrament: For we beleeue and openly
professe, that the Bodie of
Christ is in the heauen, sitting at the
right hand of the Father, and that
the Bread is onely the Sacrament of
his Body, and therefore that we neither
esteeme nor adore it for God,
but that in the Sacrament we adore

and worship our Sauiour, the Lord
Iesus, who as hee did breake his Body,
and shed his Bloud on the Crosse
for vs, so doth hee deliuer them and
apply them to our soules, to feed &
nourish vs vnto life eternall. In this
Sacrament to Kneele with this profession,
doth vindicate the religious
Ceremonie from all blot and shew
of euill, from Papistry and Idolatry:
as our profession of Christ to bee
God, did vindicate our Sitting from
the staine and impiety of Arrianism.
Know we not, that the Idolaters of
the Gentiles did bow their knees to
their Idols, Iupiter, Mars, &c? And
Christians in this Ceremonie did
symbolize with them in bowing of
their knees to God: but the Profession
made difference betwixt our
Kneeling and theirs.
               
               
                  
                  SECT. 7. That Kneeling hath, and may bee
lawfully vsed in the Sacrament,
as it is, and was, in
Prayer.
                  O But thou wilt say, that Kneeling
was euer vsed in prayer, but was
lately brought in vse at the Sacrament
by Honorius, to worship the
bread. I answered before, that it was
not ordained by Honorius to be vsed
at the receiuing, but at the eleuation,
and carrying of it from place to
place: For at the receiuing of it, it
had beene the custome before Honorius
time to haue bowed, as the decree
in speciall commanded the
Priest to teach the people to bow
themselues reuerently, Cum eleuatur
salutaris Hostia, & cum eam defert
Presbyter ad infirmum; when the sauing
Host is eleuate in the Masse,

and when it is carried to the sicke.
So doubtlesse the Priest had beene
commanded to teach the people to
bow themselues at the Receiuing: for
he who so straitly commanded the
people to Kneele at the onely sight of
this Sacrament, would much more
haue commanded them to Kneele,
when they not onely did see, but
when they receiued it, and ate it,
if it had not beene a receiued custome.
But put the case that Kneeling
then did first beginne to bee vsed in
the Sacrament, yet might not the
Church, vpon the Reasons before
expressed, haue lawfully kneeled to
God and our Sauiour, the Lord Iesus,
at the receiuing? Caluin in his
4. book of Instit. cap. 17. sect. 37. affirmeth
it in these words, Christo inquiunt
hanc venerationem deferimus: primam
si in coena h
                           •
                        c fieret, dicerem adorationem
cam demum esse legitimam,
quae non in signa residet, sed ad Christum
in caelo sedentem dirigitur. In this

place Caluin finding fault with the
worship that was giuen to the Bread
at the eleuation, and at the pompous
carrying of it thorow the streetes &
publike places; saith, that then the
worship were lawfull, if it were giuen
to Christ in the action of the Supper,
& did not rest in the signe, but were
directed to Christ sitting in heauen.
Peter Martyr, a learned and diligent
Diuine, is of the same iudgement, for
so he writeth: In Sacramento distinguimus
symbola à rebus, & symbolis aliquē
honorem deferimus, nimirū, vt tractentur
decenter, & non abijciantur; sunt
enim sacrae res, & Deo semel deputatae:
quo vero adres significatas, eas prompte
& alacriter adorandas concedimus; inquit
enim Augustinus hoc in loco, Non
peccatur adorando carnem Christi, sed
peccatur non adorando, Class. 4. locus X.
Sect. 49. & 50. Adoratio interna potest
adhiberi sine periculo, neque externa sua
natura esset mala; multi enim pij genua
flectunt & adorant: In the Sacrament,

saith he, we distinguish the symbols
from the thing signified, & some honour
we yeeld to the signes; namely,
that they be decently handled, and
not slightly cast away; for they are sacred
things, & once dedicate to God;
but as for the thing signified, these we
grant, shuld be readily & chearefully
adored: for August. saith in this place,
that it is no fault to adore Christs
flesh, but it is sin not to adore it. And
after a little; Inward adoration may
be vsed without perill, neither is the
outward adoration euill of it selfe: for
many bow their Knees & adore religiously.
Caluin in the action of the
Supper saith, that it is lawfull to bow
down and worship Christ sitting in heauen.
And Martyr saith, That not only
is it lawfully done; but pie, religiously.
Then I say, Albeit it might be, that in
the action of the Supper men bowed
not before the daies of Honorius, yet
certainely they might haue lawfully
bowed, for the reasons aboue named.
               
               
                  
                  SECT. 8. The obiection of the Brazen Serpent
answered.
                  IF the Church might haue lawfully
bowed at this Sacrament, to God,
before Honorius time, why may she
not now bow as well as then? Because
(say you) that gesture in this
action hath beene abused to Idolatry:
and therefore as Hezekias caused
the brazen Serpent to be broken,
from the time the people beganne to
adore it; so should Kneeling be abolished
in this action, and not vsed,
because therein it hath beene abused
to Idolatry. That the answer to this
may bee the more cleere, two things
would be considered; the first is, that
when Hezekias destroyed the brazen
Serpent, it had no vse in Religion;
next, that when the Brazen Serpent
was destroyed, hee discharged not
that the worship should be giuen to

God, to whom it was due, that before
was abused, and giuen to the Brazen
Serpent, as to bow their knees,
to lift vp their eyes and hands, and
to burne incense to God, although
before they had abused all these
things, & giuen them to the Serpent.
So by this example we are taught to
destroy the Idol, but not to discharge
the worship due to God, that hath
beene abused and giuen to the Idoll.
These things being considered, let vs
apply this example to the purpose;
The Bread was made the Idoll in the
Sacrament, and it was adored, and
vnto it the Knee was bowed, which
ought onely to haue beene bowed to
God; then the Bread should be abolished:
but that cannot bee, neither
will the example enforce that, because
it is not like the Brazen Serpent,
that had no vse in the worship of
God; for it is an essentiall part of the
Sacrament: and therefore although
it was adored for God, & yet is made

an Idoll by Idolaters, it is not to be abolished
by vs, but by the sound & solid
doctrine of the Word, should be
restored to the right vse & estimation
that wee should haue of it in the Sacrament:
So this example teacheth vs
not to discharge the bowing of the
Knee; a gesture commanded by God
to be vsed in his worship; but whē we
bow & adore, non in signo residere, not
to rest on the signe, as Caluin saith, but
to lift vp our hearts to Christ that is
in heauen, to worship him, his Body
& his Bloud, whereof this Sacrament
is a memorial, & an Image, not made
nor grauen by the hand of man, but
institute by Christ himselfe, to represent
his Passion, and the application
thereof to vs, that therby we might be
stirred vp to giue thankes, both with
externall & internall deuotion: which
when we performe with bowing of
the Knee, at the receiuing of the Sacrament,
we adore not the Sacramēt,
but Christ that is signified and represented
thereby.
               
               
                  
                  SECT. 0. The difference betwixt Kneeling at
the Sacrament, and before
Images.
                  IF here it be replyed, that all Idolaters
doe likewise professe, that
they bow not the knee to the Image,
but to God, whom the Image representeth
and bringeth to their remembrance:
I answer, that he is an
euill grounded Christian, who
hath not learned to put difference
betwixt the vse of an Image in diuine
worship, and the workes of
God, his Word and holy Sacraments.
Images are the doctrines of
lies: they represent nothing, nor
bring nothing to our mindes of
God, but lyes: They teach vs, that
God hath eyes, and seeth not, eares &
heareth not, feete & walketh not, and
in them God is not worshipped, but

a conception and fantasie in stead of
God, bred and gendred in the mind
by the Image: where, by the contrarie
the least of Gods creatures
doe demonstrate and shew so much
of the diuinitie and power of God,
as may serue to ingender in our
hearts, a true conception of him,
and may furnish sufficient matter
and cause, wherfore to worship him.
How much more his Word and holy
Sacraments, where God and his
goodnesse is so liuely expressed? To
bow downe then, when wee haue
seene the workes of God, when wee
haue heard the Word, and when we
receiue the Sacraments: To adore
him, whom by his Workes, the
Word, and Sacraments, wee are
taught to adore, is neither to bow
downe to an Idoll, nor to worship
God in an Idoll. When the fire
came downe from heauen and consumed
Elias sacrifice, the people that
saw it, fell on their faces, and cryed,

                     The Lord is God; The Lord is God. In
doing whereof, they adored not the
fire, but the Lord, whome the fire
taught them to be God. 1. Cor. 14. 24.
If yee all prophecy (saith Paul) and an
Infidell or Ideot come in, he is conuinced
by all, hee is iudged by all, and so
the secrets of his heart are made manifest,
and so falling on his face, he adores
God, &c. In both these two examples,
the principall cause of the falling
downe, is God, to whome they fell
downe, but the miraculous worke of
the fire, and the word of the Prophecy
were the instrumentall causes,
whereby they were wakened, and
stirred vp. Causae monitoriae & excitantes.
Euen so, when wee fall downe at
the Sacrament, the principall cause
that moueth vs, is God, to whom we
Kneele: but the Sacrament is the instrument,
whereby wee are taught,
and admonished to fall downe at
that time, and in that place; It
being a memoriall of the death of

Christ, and the seale of the benefit
of saluation, that wee haue thereby.
And although wee carry a religious
respect and reuerence to the Sacrament,
as a meane and creature consecrated
to a most holy vse, yet not of
that religious respect and reuerence
that we carry towards it; we bow not
downe our knees before it, but out of
the religious respect and reuerence,
that by it, which wee are taught to
giue to Christ, we bow our knees before
him, to whome all knees should
be bowed in that respect. And therefore
this assertion (That hee who boweth
at the receiuing of the Sacramentall
Bread & Wine, boweth down in the Act
of Diuine worship, before a consecrated
creature, out of a religious respect and
reuerence of it. This assertion (I say)
is a vaine Sophisticall cauillation: for
the reuerence and respect that we are
taught by Gods Word to carry to
the Sacrament, is not the cause of
our bowing downe when we receiue

it: So out of that respect we bow not
downe as hath beene said, but the reuerence
and respect that wee are
taught by the Sacrament to giue to
Christ, is the cause of our bowing
downe: the reuerence that is due to
the Sacrament, is not such as should
moue vs to fall downe before it; but
the reuerence that is due to Christ,
whereof wee are admonished by the
Sacrament, wherin he is represented,
breaking his Body and sheading his
Bloud vpon the Crosse for vs, and
with his owne hand applying it to
nourish vs vnto eternall Life. This
reuerence, I say, is such, and so great,
as no gesture nor position of body
is able sufficiently to expresse. Further,
it is heere to bee marked, that
hee who boweth at the receiuing
of the Sacrament, is not properly
said to bow before the Sacrament:
for Coram 
                     
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , which wee interpret
(before) is only properly attributed to
liuing things, and not to things that

want life; such as the Sacramentall elements
be; so wee are properly said
to bow before God, or the congregation,
that is, to God, and in presence
of the congregation: but when
wee speake of things that want life,
we say not, before them, or coram, but
versus, è regione, or ante, oueragainst,
or towards them: So Dauid saith, I
will bow towards the Temple of thy holinesse,
not, before it. It is properly
said, that Idolaters bow before the
Sacramentall Bread: for they esteeme
it to bee GOD, and bow themselues
to worship it: but as for those
who worship the true God, they bow
themselues before God, at the Sacrament,
that is, when they receiue
the Sacrament. This is to bee marked,
that the simple bee not abused
by the ambiguity of the word, and
made to thinke that it is one thing,
to bow at the receiuing of the Sacrament,
and to bow before the Sacrament;
to worship it, as Papists doe,

which wee professe our selues to
damne and detest. So to conclude
this point; It is true, that the Papists
Kneele when they receiue the
Sacrament, and so doe not wee;
wee Kneele to Christ that sitteth in
Heauen, and so doe not they;
They giue to the Sacramentall
Bread, the worship that is due to
Christ; but wee giue that worship
vnto Christ himselfe. Therefore
their Kneeling is prohibited in the
second Commandement, and ours is
allowed: for vnto mee (saith God) all
knees shall bow.
                  
               
               
                  SECT. 10. Wee strengthen not Papists in their Idolatry,
by our Kneeling at the
Sacrament.
                  FInally, it may be obiected, that by
introducing this gesture of Kneeling
in stead of Sitting, vsed in our

Church before, wee strengthen our
aduersaries in their idolatry, weaken
the faith of our infirme brethren, and
condemne those that reformed our
Religion. Vnto the first I answere,
that the Idolatry of Papists consisteth
no more in Kneeling at the actiō
of the Sacrament, then at the action
of publike prayer: And as their Idolatry
in praying standeth in this, that
they direct their prayers, and bow
their knees to the Saints and Idols
whom they adore, and not to God:
So in this Sacrament, their Idolatry
is, the adoring and bowing of their
knees to the Element of Bread, and
not to their Sauiour, the Bread of
Life. And therefore, as the bowing
of our knees, when wee pray to God,
confirmeth them not in their Idolatry
in praying to Saints, no more in
this action doth the bowing of our
knees to Christ, confirme their Idolatry,
in adoring the Bread: And so
themselues esteeme, whose writings

are no lesse vehement against our
Kneeling at the Sacrament, then against
our Sitting: for it is not the
Kneeling, except it be before an Idol,
(which God forbid wee should esteeme
the Sacrament to bee) that
maketh the worship Idolatrous: but
the opinion, affection, and profession
of the Idolaters, if they beleeue the
Bread to bee God, and bee in their
hearts affected, and deuoted to it as
to God, and openly in the doctrine
and profession, auouch it to be God.
Then it being manifest, that by Kneeling,
they worship it, their bread is
an Idoll, and their Kneeling Idolatrous:
for an Idoll is not made by the
operation of the hand, but by the opinion
of the heart, and confession of
the mouth, that is, not by the craftsman,
but the worshipper. By the contrary,
the Bread which wee breake,
and the Cup which we blesse, is not
made an Idoll, when at the receiuing
we bow our knees to God: Because

in our confession of faith, and
in our publike Doctrine, in the
thanksgiuing that goeth before our
receiuing, and in our Exhortations
we openly professe and affirme, that
the Bread is not materially the Body
it selfe, but the Sacrament of the
Body of Christ, that the Cup is not
materially, the Bloud it selfe, but the
Sacrament of the Bloud of Christ:
And therefore that our adoration
and Kneeling is erected to God and
our Sauiour, who sitteth in Heauen
at the right hand of the Father. And
thus by our Kneeling, Idolaters are
not confirmed▪ but confuted.
               
               
                  
                  SECT. II. The Kneeling offendeth not the weake
Brethren.
                  AS for our weake brethren, it is
not the introduction of Kneeling
that maketh them to offend, of
whom I haue heard many affirm, that
there is no gesture that can sufficiently
expresse the reuerence and respect
that in this action they owe to
God: If patiently wee can abide to
heare the truth, the verity is, there is
nothing that giueth such offence to
the people, as our contentions amongst
our selues, while we pretend
the offence of the people. When
they see Cephas incensed against Paul,
and Paul against Cephas, Pastor against
Pastor, for Sitting and Kneeling;
what can the simple people
thinke, but that in these Ceremonies
the substance of Religion consisteth,

and that the change of these is the alteration
of Religion, seeing we make
so much adoe about them? If we did
informe our people, as our duty is,
that the Kingdome of God is neither
in Sitting, Standing nor Kneeling,
but that these are indifferent
Ceremonies, that may bee vsed and
not vsed; vsed in some Churches,
and not vsed in others; vsed in some
ages, and not vsed in others; vsed by
some persons, and not vsed by others;
as may serue best for edification:
That the reformed Church of
France that Standeth, when they rereiue
the Sacrament, differeth not in
any substantiall point of Religion,
from our Church that Sate; and the
Church of England that Kneeleth,
differeth not from the Church of
France, nor vs when we Sate, and they
stood: And therefore that now when
we shall Kneele, wee shall differ nothing
from our selues, when we Sate,
in any substantiall and necessarie

point or Ceremony, that belongeth
to this sacred action. If this wee
would informe the people, and cease
from contention, there would be no
scandall taken by them. Caluin. Inst.
lib. 4. cap. 10 sect. 30. God would not
(saith the learned Diuine) in externall
Ceremonies and Discipline prescribe
particularly what we ought to follow, because
he foresaw, that to depend from the
condition of times, neither did he iudge
one forme agreeable to all ages. Heere
then (saith he) wee must flye to the generall
rules, which God hath giuen, that
according to them may be defined whatsoeuer
the necessity of the Church requireth
to bee appointed for order and decency.
Finally, seeing God hath set downe
nothing expresly, because they are neither
necessary to saluation, and are diuersly
to be applyed to the manners of euery
age, and for the edification of the
Church: It is lawful, as the vtility of the
Church shall require, as well to change
and abrogate those that haue beene in

vse, as to appoint new Ceremonies. I confesse
indeed, that we should not run rashly
and for light motiues to nouation: but
what may hurt, & what may edifie, charity
can best iudge: Quam si moderatricē
partiemur, salua erunt omnia. Which
charity if we can suffer to be moderatrix,
all things shal be in safety and go
well. The same Author immediately
before speaking of Kneeling, saith,
that in the generall, it is commanded by
God, but the speciall determination
when and where, and in what cases it is
to be vsed, is left to the arbiterment of
the Church. If the vse of this Ceremony,
which is appointed by God
himselfe, be left to the determination
of the Church, shall Standing or Sitting
be exempted from their iudgement,
Ceremonies that are not prescribed
by God? It is true, that for
Standing wee haue some examples,
but no rule nor precept, except it bee
for the Priests Standing at the Altar,
when he did offer the Sacrifice. In

the publike worship of God, such as
sacrificing and praying, I find not
Sitting to haue been vsed. As for the
Passeouer, it was sacrificed publikely,
but was eaten in priuate houses, as
another ordinary supper, whereat for
commodity and ease, they were accustomed
to Sit. Moses, when he was
wearie of Standing, Exod. 17. 12.
was set on a Stone. Heere the Ceremony
giueth place to Charity, and
the seruice was not ordinary, but miraculous
and extraordinary, 1. Kings
19. 4. Elias likewise being wearie,
did sit downe vnder a Iuniper Tree,
vbi expetebat cum animo suo: Tremellius
interprets Secum, where he desired
in his heart to dye, and said, It is enough,
Lord, take my soule. This prayer
is made in a secret place, and seemeth
to haue been a priuy Meditation,
2. Samuel 7. 18. Our Translation
hath, that Dauid went in, and Sate before
the Lord. The Marginall note
hath, remained. 1. Chronicles 17. 16.

                     Tremellius translateth the word Restitit,
and noteth in the Margent, Consedit
Catachresis. And wee know the
word to bee often taken for Manere,
to remaine: This gesture of Sitting,
neuer commanded and neuer, or very
seldome practised in Gods publike
worship; must bee far more subiect to
the Iudgement of the Church, and
the power that she hath to abrogate
and change Ceremonies (as Caluin
saith) then Kneeling. And yet wee
finde, the Primitiue Church to haue
discharged the vse of Kneeling at
Prayer on the Lords Day, and on euery
day from Pasche till Whit-sunday,
and in stead thereof to haue appointed
Standing. If after this manner
the Church might haue lawfully
interchanged Kneeling, a gesture ordained
by God himselfe, with Standing,
touching the which there is no
precept: How much more may our
Church interchange Sitting, a gesture
neuer cōmanded in any publike

Act of Diuine worship, with Kneeling,
a gesture comanded by God,
and most agreeable to this Sacrament
in euery respect, without giuing
of Scandall, either to Pastor or
people?
               
               
                  SECT. 4. That by Kneeling at the Sacrament, the
reformation and practice of our
Church is not damned.
                  NEither doth this interchange
damne the reformation and
practice of our Church, which hitherto
hath vsed Sitting, a Ceremony indifferent
in it selfe, in their iudgement
meetest for these times, for to
abolish the Idolatrous opinion of
Transubstantiation, and to declare
our separation from the Popish
Church, wherein the truth of Gods
Word (all praise bee to him) hath

so preuailed, that publikely throughout
the Kingdome, Transubstantiation,
the Masse and Idolatry therof, is
vniuersally abolished and abhorred.
So that now we haue greater cause to
be afraid that abuse and corruption
shall creepe into this Sacrament,
from pride, prophanenesse, and Arrianisme,
then from Papistry; as men
are prone to runne headlong from
the one, to the other extremity;
frō the conceit of Transubstantiation,
to contempt and despising of the sacred
action, and from the adoring of
the Bread, to adore themselues, affirming
in print, that it is a great sin
if a man in this Action do think himselfe
inferiour to Christ, and doe not
esteeme and carry himselfe as his equall.
And what is that but to adore
himselfe, if Christ should be adored?
This I call a Luciferian pride, or Arrianisme:
for he that accounteth himselfe
Christs equall, must either in
his conceit abase Christ from being

such a person as 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , God
manifested in the flesh, and from the
glorious condition of that estate:
whereunto hee is exalted at the right
hand of the Father, far aboue Principalities
and Powers, which is
worse then Arrianisme: Or hee must
imagine himselfe to be such a person,
and of such quality, as our Sauiour
is, which no creature is, nor euer
shall be. The Scripture saith, That
when hee appeareth, wee shall bee like
him, but not his Equals; Coheires
wee are called; but are and euer shall
bee inferiours in degree to our elder
Brother, with whom wee must not
striue for an equall portion: but
content with such as shall please him
to vouchsafe vs: for all is his by nature
and merit, and by his grace onely
wee are, and shall bee what wee
are. To thinke otherwise, is a Luciferian
pride: these detestable assertions,
springing from the bitter root
of contention, about this gesture of

Sitting at Table, do euidently declare,
what place some men haue begunne
already to giue to Pride, Profanenesse
and Arrianisme: and how
lightly they esteeme of the Sacrament,
when they professe themselues
to esteeme so basely of our Sauiour,
the substance of the Sacrament, and
so highly of themselues. What reuerence
is giuen by the common
people to this Action, that I leaue to
be considered by euery Pastor in his
seuerall charge; I feare, they thinke
it lesse then they would wish. As we
therefore doe not, nor should not
condemne and despise the iudgement
of our godly Predecessors, who
to root out Idolatry, did interchange
Kneeling with Sitting: so should we
not condemne & despise the iudgement
of our Church at this time,
who haue againe interchanged Sitting
with Kneeling, considering it is
an indifferent Ceremonie, and Religious,
not onely for the vse, but for

the Authour thereof, God; and that
now matters standing in the estate
wherin they are, it may haue as good
and profitable an vse in our Church,
as Sitting had before: For as Sitting
hath helped to roote out the errour
of Transubstantiation, and to abolish
the Idolatrous Bread-worship; so
Kneeling shall serue to preserue the
Sacrament, from profanation, our
selues from pride, our Sauiour from
contempt, and to debarre those frantike
opinions aboue expressed. Sitting
hath made a separation betwixt
vs, and the corruptions of the Romane
Church: Kneeling shall serue
to declare our Vnion with other wel-reformed
Churches, with whom
otherwise wee agree in all points of
doctrine: and to winne such to our
profession, of the Romane Church,
who doe not so much abhorre our
Communion for any errour in the
substance of faith, as for the profanenesse
that they esteeme to bee in

some externall Ceremonies. Paul became
all things to all men, in things
indifferent, to winne some: if hee
became all things, may wee not in
some things; yea, in a thing commanded
by God, conforme our
selues to winne some, if it be possible?
Finally, who is ignorant, that all this
alteration and change hath proceeded
from the constant resolution, &
the instant desire of a most wise and
religious Prince, our gracious Soueraigne?
A motiue of the greatest moment
on earth; if either wee consider
his Royall authority, or Fatherly
affection; what power hee hath by
the one, and what credit hee deseruedly
hath by the other: who hath
giuen, and daily giues greater proofe
of his loue and care towards the glory
of God, and the welfare of his
Church; both by way of action and
passion, then all his Subiects beside.
His Highnesse Will then & Desire,
against this and other points,

being most orderly & formally propounded
to the generall Assembly
of our Church, to bee aduised, reasoned
and concluded: and being in
it selfe most iust and reasonable, as his
Maiestie is perswaded, not onely out
of his owne most profound and incomparable
knowledge (as in euery
thing, so chiefly in matters of this
kinde) but by the iudgement of the
best and most learned Diuines of the
Church: His Maiesties Will, I say,
being such, and after such a manner
propounded, and concerning onely
matters indifferent and alterable:
if without greater reason, then any
that was, or hath beene propounded
to the contrarie, it had beene gainestood;
and his Highnesse thereby
moued to griefe & displeasure: there
is no question, but vpon those
grounds and reasons, whereby hee
was perswaded that his purpose was
lawfull, hee might haue beene prouoked
to proceed, and by his Royall

Anthority inioyne and command
both Pastors and People, to giue obedience
in obseruing and practising
these Articles: which if his Maiesty
had done, then should we, who were
the Pastors of the Church, and members
of that Meeting, haue iustly incurred
the blame of pertinacie, and
of vnwise contention in the estimation
of all peaceable, and well-disposed
Christians: and should haue giuen
occasion to seditious and vnquiet
spirits, to burden a most iust and
equitable Prince, with a most vile imputation
of tyrannie; and made the
Aduersaries of the Truth to reioyce
and exult, beholding through our
foolishnesse, a breach made, and a
gap opened, whereby the enemy
might enter in betwixt vs and our
gracious Soueraigne: whereupon
what euils might haue followed, may
be easily perceiued by all, who haue
not their opinions in greater estimation,
then the honour of the Prince,

the welfare of their brethren, and the
Peace of the Church whereof they
are members. The consideration &
meditation of these things, are the
reasons that mooue mee to thinke;
that in faith we may obey the acts
of the late Assembly, in this, and all
the rest of the Articles concluded
therein: and therefore that in faith
wee cannot disobey, but shall thereby
offend our God▪ giue scandall to
his Church, and vantage to the Aduersaries
by our contentions and
distractions: From the which, the
God of Peace preserue vs, & blesse
vs with that Peace that passeth all vnderstanding,
vntill our Peace-maker
appeare, who shall reward his brethren
the Peace-makers, not onely
with that most honorable stile to bee
called the Sonnes of God, but to
bee Heires and Coheires with him,
of the Kingdome of God. Amen.
