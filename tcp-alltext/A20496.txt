            For those which haue
their Health.
            HE which hath his health and would
so continue, I wish him either to
forbeare or little to vse those thinges
which greatly digresse from that constitution,
or mediocritie in which man
is created. Our Phisitians do cal euerie
thing hot or cold, in the respect of ye
nature of man. For if it be somewhat
hotter thē his nature, thē it digresseth,
and they tearme it hot in the second degree,
and in like maner to the third and
fourth, which because it doeth so far exceede
his constitution, by daily proofe
is founde to be vnto him flat poyson,
the like consideration on the contrarie
side haue they of colde things, wherby
you may gather how like alwaies
desireth like, and abhoreth the contrary.
The thinges which are like, and
best agree with the nature of man, are
good holsome vsual meates & drinks, a
dry fresh & sweet ayre, moderat sleepe

and trauell or labor, which although it
were alotted vnto vs as punnishment
by GOD. Yet mercifully withall he
hath made it a meane to preserue our
health, the thinges which greatly disagree
are wines, spice, salt meats, and al
very hot thinges, which thou shalt
know by tast, for either they bite like
Peper, fret like salt, or els shewe some
great manifest heat in the mouth. Also
on the other, side, all rawe fruits and
cold herbes, with diuers things of like
nature, much vse of Sawses deuised
by belly gods, whom God hath
punished as much by want of appetite,
hauing meate at wil: as the poore
by want of meat hauing good apetite,
to liue in a thicke foggy ayre, to liue
idlely and to exceede in eating & drinking,
sleeping watching or venery. I
would not haue any man to thincke
that I doe vtterly condeme al very hot
and cold things, but seing they are rather
of the nature of medecine then nutriment:
I wish them to be verie discretly
& moderatly vsed, for hot things
are to be vsed when a mans bodie is

very cold, and cold thinges when his
bodie is ouer hot, but to vse either the
bodie being not distempered, is mere
madnes. Now further for asmuch as
all men are subiect vnto death, and our
bodies as yelding therunto, from time
to time alwaies gather coruption, to
preserue our health as much as may
be, vntill wee haue run that race which
God hath appointed. I comende vnto
you this receipt.
            Take Borage and Parsley in like
quātity, boyle them in Whey clarified
& kepe it in some earthen vessell, vse of
it warme in ye spring, especialy euery
morning fasting a good draught, and
in euery draught take so much of a polion
as will geue thee two stooles a
day more then ordinary, some may vse
it ten dayes together some fifteene or
twenty as the body doeth require, by
this meanes thou maist preuent many
disseases and kepe thy bodie in verie
good state, it maketh women apt to
conceiue, if during the taking thereof
they liue chast, and it hath many other
special vertues which for breuities

sake I will omit. Their is yet one dissease
wherewith our wantons here of
England are much trobled for not resperting
the force or helpe of nature, if
they feele neuer so small or light a
griefe, they must presently to Phisick,
vntill they haue so filled their Bodies
with drinks that they are sicker of their
Phisicke, then of any dissease, in this
griefe a little more wit will bee a present
help, for so shall they haue he auier
purses lighter hearts & soūder bodies.

            BEware of coldnes both of the aire,
as misses, wind, thin clothing, vncleane
lodging, with opē windowes in
yt chāber, or lying on thy back or nere
the ground, but vse sweet warme aire
with a smale fire not neare at hand, it
wil help ye matter to ripe, wheras coldnes
will binde and driue back the matter

and kill the pacient sodainly, suppe
cleane broth of chickins, eate but little
and oft, couit to sleep in the might vi. or
vii. howers for sleepe is a great friend
to nature, if sleepe come not in yt night▪
then refuse not sleep in the day, sitting
in thy Chaire with thy head vpright
after meate twoo houres, walke not
much vp & doune, for rest with warmnes
is agreat nourisher of the humors
specially bloud and choller, be rather
laxatiue on the day, then the night. Beware
of carefulnes for wordly things
Looke not into the glasse of desperation,
with Agony and heauines of mind.
Hope euer for the best, for a good stomake
driueth away many disseases:
but when the spirit is vexed: who may
abide it. A mery heart is the life to the
body but rancor consumeth the bones.
Heauines doth bring sicknes, and they
whiche haue heauy countenaunces,
with continuall agony, are either to
rich, to poore, too sicke, too folish, or to
sore opressed. Therefore cōmend gladnes,
because a mā hath no better thing
vnder the sunne, then to eate and drink

betime and to leasure, and to be merie
for that shall he haue for his labour, all
the dayes of his life, which almightie
God hath giuen him vnder the sunne,
for there is nothing better then
gladnes, honest
                  •
                of life, loue

                  ••

doe as we
would be done vnto.
Thus fare you well.
