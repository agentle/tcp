                  AS I a ſlepe in bedde did lye,
               In a ſtormie and windie night:
               I hard a voice full loude did crie,
               Beholde a dolefull ſight.
               A woman here lieth dedde on grounde,
               God knoweth here I dead haue her found,
               Drawe nere and ſee her deadly wounde,
               Whiche greuous is to me:
               Beholde he ſaied, and cried faſte,
               She is out of a windowe caſte,
               The people then in all the haſte,
               Drewe nere that facte to ſee.
            
            
               And I drewe nere emong the reſte,
               This vglie ſight to vewe:
               Alas I ſawe it was no geſte,
               His ſaiynges was to true.
               For there the corps of one laie dedde,
               At night ſhe merie went to bedde,
               But now the peoples eyes ſhe fedde,
               As ſhe laie on the grounde,
               I muſyng how this facte might bee,
               One ſaied, O man doeſt thou not ſee,
               It is her huſbandes worke truely,
               That hath giuen her deathes wounde.
            
            
               
               Then for her huſbande I did call,
               And aſked where he might bee:
               No newes of hym there was at all,
               For no man did hym ſee.
               Then to his doore I did procede,
               In all the haſte I knockt with ſpede,
               Then came he forthe that did the deede,
               He knewe it was not well,
               And when he came he was agaſte,
               Becauſe he heard me knocke ſo faſte,
               Where is thy wife, I aſkte at laſte,
               Saied he I can not tell.
            
            
               I tooke hym then faſte by the arme,
               His wife to hym did ſhowe:
               I aſkte of hym who was the ſame,
               Saied he, I doe not knowe,
               O man ſaied I, were thou diſtracte,
               When thou committeſt this wicked facte,
               If thou haddeſt tolde, what was thy lacke,
               Or opened once thy mynde,
               If thou to God haddeſt often praied
               On thee had neuer come this daie,
               Come man with me, thou muſt awaie,
               Leaue houſe and gooddes behynde.
            
            
               
               Then to the Sherief I hym brought,
               Within a little ſpace:
               And by the waie I hym beſought,
               To call to God for grace.
               Saiyng thou haſt not long to leue,
               Wherefore the ſelf to praier geue,
               From God ſee nothyng thee remeue,
               But in hym put thy truſte,
               The Sherief beyng ſcarcely raied,
               To here this facte, was halfe diſmaied,
               Game forthe, and to this man he ſaied,
               To priſon now thou muſte.
            
            
               I tooke hym then faſte by the hande.
               Awaie with hym I went:
               Thou kildeſt thy wife, I vnderſtande,
               Tell me for what intente.
               Was there betwene you ſuche debate,
               That in thy harte ſprong mortall hate,
               For to kill her that was thy mate,
               The deuill was greate in thee.
               His wordes thei were to me againe,
               This mynde in me did long remaine,
               She is now rewarded for her paine,
               That ſhe hath doen to me.
            
            
               
               But yet I aſkt hym this before,
               Saiyng, ſome doeth beare in hande,
               Thou haſte money, and that good ſtore,
               Let me it vnderſtande.
               That parte of it maie now thee helpe,
               While thou art in this miſerie,
               Where it doeth lye, therefore tell me,
               Giue ſome before thou dye,
               If I ſhould neuer goe here hence.
               I haue no more but one fiue pence,
               That God doth knowe, who is my defence
               I ſpeake vnfainedly.
            
            
               Vnto the place I brought hym then,
               Impriſoned for to bee:
               And this I ſaied to hym againe,
               Loe here now thou maieſt ſee.
               In priſon here thou ſhalbe caſte,
               In yron colde thou ſhalbe faſte,
               Cauſe of the deede that doen thou haſte,
               Whiche greuous is to ſee.
               But how that thou diddeſt kill thy wife,
               Was it with dagger or with knife,
               Or how thou tookeſt awaie her life,
               I praie thee tell it me.
            
            
               
               Seyng you requeſt ſo earneſtly,
               The truthe of me to knowe,
               I will it tell you certainly,
               And all thyng to you ſhowe.
               This night before we were merie,
               As any man and wife could be:
               And that the neighbours did vs ſee,
               Betwene vs was no ſtrife,
               And after I had ſlept a while,
               I did not thinke her yet to ſpoile,
               Till in my head was put this ſtile,
               A riſe goe kill thy wife.
            
            
               Then was I in a marueilous rage,
               I could not long lye ſtill,
               Ther was nothyng my wrath could ſwage
               But I muſt worke my will.
               Then from my wife there did I goe,
               Recountyng her to be my foe,
               Wherefore I thought to worke her woe,
               What meane you man ſhe ſaied,
               And if thou be a very man,
               Tell me whether thou doeſt goe than,
               My aunſwere was, I will come anan,
               It forceth not to thee.
            
            
               
               Then doune I went immediately,
               To the haule I did procede:
               I knowyng where the knife did lye,
               The whiche ſhould doe the deede.
               When in my hande I had it take,
               I of her death accoumpte did make,
               Came vp and ſodainly her ſtrake,
               In bedde where ſhe did lye.
               And when ſhe felt her fleſhe ſo ſmarte,
               Out of the bedde anone ſhe ſtarte.
               O man ſaied ſhe. you haue perced my hart,
               That I am like to dye.
            
            
               Yet for all that I did not leaue,
               But wounded her in deede,
               Her woundes I could not well perceiue,
               But as I felte them bleede.
               Alas ſhe ſaied, no more, O man,
               For Chriſtes ſake now holde thy hande,
               I am nere death, I vnderſtande,
               Sweete man no more, ſhe cried.
               But when ſhe ſawe no remedie,
               O man ſhe ſaied, God forgeue thee,
               And Chriſt take mercie vpon me,
               And ſo fell doune and died.
            
            
               
               A candle then in all the haſt,
               I went to light with ſpeede,
               For ſorowes none my harte did taſte,
               For all my wicked deede.
               If light I could haue gotte at all,
               My neighbours in I would haue call,
               To ſee what had betwene vs fall,
               My wife there dedde ſhould ſee.
               But ſeyng that I no light could gette,
               Into the bedde againe I lepte,
               Thinkyng a while for to to haue ſlept,
               Alas it would not be.
            
            
               A thouſāde thoughtes came in my minde
               My wittes were not myne owne,
               To ſeé how blouddely I was fedde,
               With ſeedes whiche the diuell had ſowen,
               For then my wife on grounde laie dedde,
               Before a ſlepe ſhe was on bedde,
               And yet my mynde was alwaies ledde,
               Againſt her for to be.
               For I no ſorrowe yet did taſte,
               Roſe vp againe in all the haſt,
               Out at a windowe I her caſt,
               Cauſe people ſhould her ſee.
            
            
               
               O what a harte man hadſt thou,
               To wound thy wife ſo ſore,
               A wound or twoo had bene enow,
               If it had been no more.
               But all the while ſhe was aliue,
               Thou neuer ceaſeſt but ſtill did ſtriue,
               Till ſhe had twentie wounds and fiue,
               Whiche one her all were tolde,
               After that I had once begonne,
               Greate haſt I made till I had doen,
               Thereby my death I haue now wonne,
               That all men maie beholde.
            
            
               Then was he brought vnto the hall,
               For to receaue his meede,
               And there by name they did hym call.
               Touchyng his wicked deede,
               One ſaide to hym holde vp thy hande,
               Thou kildeſt thy wife I vnderſtande,
               How ſaieſt, is it true, ſpeake O man,
               Art thou giltie, yea or no.
               It was my deede I not deny,
               Wherefore good people praie for me,
               He to the iudge againe did ſaie,
               Giltie the trouth is ſo.
            
            
               
               The iudge then iudgement on him gaue
               And ſaied now thou muſt dye:
               Worſe death thou haſt deſerued to haue,
               But take this paciently.
               From whence againe thou ſhalt retourne,
               Vnto the place from whence thou come,
               With theſe thy fellowes all and ſome,
               That were ſo leudely ledde,
               To Mighels hille, then thou ſhalt procede,
               There for to receiue thy meede,
               Becauſe thou diddeſt a wicked deede,
               Hang there till thou be dedde.
            
            
               When to his death then that he went,
               The preacher went hym by,
               Exhortyng hym, ſaiyng repent,
               Prepare thy ſelf to dye.
               This worlde now that thou muſt leaue,
               And that thou ſeeſt and well perceiue,
               God will thy ſoule no doubt receiue,
               For all this wicked deede.
               Truſt then in Chriſt ſaued to be,
               Beleue I ſaie, that onely he,
               Thy wickedneſſe hath forgiue thee,
               He hath it ſo decreed.
            
            
               
               But when he came vnto the place,
               In deede where he ſhould die:
               One ſaied, beholde the ende and race,
               Of all thy miſerie.
               Anon thy ſoule in heauen ſhalbe,
               Where thou ſhalt God beholde and ſee,
               With greate ioye and felicitie,
               Feare not to die therefore,
               There ſainctes and angels doeth ſtill ſyng,
               We praiſe the lorde our heauenly kyng,
               And then with them thou ſhalt begin,
               To praiſe hym euermore.
            
            Finis.
            
               ꝙ D. S.
            
         
         
            ¶An admoniſhment
of the ſame.
            
               YE that on yearth with liuely ſence,
            are now adorned right:
            Perpende and notifie this facte,
            expreſſed here in ſight.
            He bare the name of honeſtie,
            as by his outwarde ſhowe.
            Appered no leſſe, for but a fewe,
            
               
the contrarie did knowe:
            Yet in his harte ſuch deadly ſinne,
            for want of ſeruyng God.
            There did remaine that vainly he,
            did nought regarde his Rodde:
            And as a ſtock whiche outwardly,
            is trim bedeckt with Golde.
            Beſet with pearles and precious ſtones,
            yea more then twentie folde:
            But yet within is nothyng els,
            but Timber rough and plaine:
            Euen ſo was he a perſone light,
            and of opinion vaine.
            As by his deades it doeth appeare,
            the greater is my care:
            That ſuche as Chriſtians haue to name,
            ſhould ſo with ſinne compare.
            Therefore let al men take good heede
            how they doe leade their life:
            And how thei doe behaue them ſelues,
            in liuyng with their wife.
            If that thou canſt not well agree,
            with her and with her vſe:
            Or if thou doeſt perceiue and ſee,
            her ſelf ſhe doeth abuſe.
            
               
Admoniſhe her the contrarie,
            if that will not preuaile:
            Doe ſeparate thy ſelf from her,
            ſuche grudgyngs for to quaile.
            Tis better that thou liue alone,
            in peace and ſo to reſt:
            Then for to greeue thee with thy wife,
            or yet thy ſelf moleſt.
            If this vnrighteous perſone here,
            had followed this aduiſe:
            To ſlaie his wife from out his bedde,
            he would not ſeme to riſe.
            But Sathan who had hym ſubdued,
            did egge hym to the ſame:
            That he obliuious of the Lorde,
            did nothyng waigh the ſhame.
            That would enſue, nor yet the woe,
            wherein he ſhould remaine:
            But raſhly did put forthe hym ſelf,
            with Sathan for to raine.
            A lamentable caſe it is,
            for any chriſtian harte:
            To thinke that he a Chriſtian ſhould,
            ſo rudely plaie his parte.
            And yelde hym ſelf as Sathans thrall,
            
               
who ought in deede by right:
            To be his foe, and alſo vnder,
            Chriſt his Banour fight.
            For Sathan roareth vp and doune
            as Lions for their praie:
            Sekyng whom he maie deuour,
            and bryng vnto decaie.
            If we did well remember this,
            or beare it in our braine:
            We would not ſéeme to grée vnto,
            ſuch fancies fonde and vaine.
            But we are ſo be witched ſtill,
            with diueliſhe operation:
            That in the end it bringeth nought
            vnto vs but damnation.
            Exāple well your ſelues with this
            ſame tyraunts doyng here:
            And iudge if any feare of God,
            in hym there did appeare.
