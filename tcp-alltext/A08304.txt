               YOVR MAiesties
moste
gracious acceptance
of a
poore former
trauaile of mine, The Mirror
for the multitude, (my
most dearely beloued Soueraigne)
Emboldeneth
me, once againe in al loyal
obedience, humbly to beseech



the same to afforde
the like gracious acceptance
of this Progresse vnto
heauenly harts ease: which
although it might haue
carried a more base title,
in regarde of myne vnworthinesse,
yet considering
the course of the treatise,
and the estate of the
time, whose happines and
harts ease, is of some censured
after the quantitie
and qualitie of euerie particular
mans worldly felicitie,
I thought it not vnfit,
vnder your Maiesties
most royall protection, to
giue it that title, for that it
leadeth vnto the true



peace of the inner man:
who (howsoeuer the body
in bodily thinges, fare
in this life) ought onelye
to bee comforted and eased
with the due contemplation
of Gods most diuine
loue, ready helpe, &
prouident regard of our
inward and outward miseries:
wherewith we can
not but bee touched in
some measure while wee
liue here.
            And because we haue
here no continuing cittie,
but seeke one to come, it
behoueth vs to goe out of
the campe of these worldly



cares, and take our progresse
in the way of piety,
vnto that heauenly harbour
where wee shall rest
through the assurance of
Gods loue towards vs, in
this life, inwardly endued
with such ease of the hart,
and peace of conscience,
that whatsoeuer affliction
or crosse, thwart our endeuours,
yet shall we rest as
the Saintes of God, in a
heauenly harts ease, vntill
we come to that heauenly
Cittie, newe Ierusalem,
where wee shall haue full
fruition of all happie and
heauenly hearts ease for
euer.
            
               
Now forasmuch, most
deare Queene, as that
your gracious lenitie, affordeth
acceptance vnto
the least showe of loyall
loue, therby enciting manie
to shewe themselues
willing, to present their
trauailes vnto your sacred
view: I the worst and vnworthiest,
in all humilitie
presume to reach out the
hand of my heartie zeale,
and vnfained loue, to bee
laide euen vnder the feete
of your most sacred will
and disposition: And
woulde thinke mee your
most happiest poore subiect,
might it please your



Maiestie fauourablye to
accept this my poore
Progresse.
            
               
                  Your Maiesties most happie
subiect in seeing your gracious
dayes, whose ende God
grant I neuer see.

            The Authors Praier
which hee vsed in the
performing of this
worke.
            
               OH merciful & wise
god, what am I that
I shoulde take thy
word into my mouth? That I
should vndertake to celebrate
the praises of thy name, being
a man of polluted lips, of a defiled
hart, & of a corrupt conuersation
before thee.
            I do acknowledge against my
selfe (good Father) that I deserue
not to bee heard when I
crie, so ignorant am I of my
self, vnable rightly to pray for
my self, but rather to be reiected:
and especially presuming
to set downe rules & directions
to teach others to pray.
            
               
But in all humilitie (my
good God) I enter into thy
presence, crauing pardon for
my sinnes, and thy directions
in my proceedings, who saydst
vnto Dauid, Open thy
mouth, and I will fill it, oh
fill me with thy diuine knowledge,
and I shall be filled, and
shew thy glorie to posterities.
Thou that saidst vnto Paul,
My grace is sufficient for
thee, assist mee with that
grace, and enable me to performe
those thinges through
the strength thereof, which in
loue of thee I haue conceiued,
and in thy feare haue purposed
to publish, to the glory, and
comfort of thy childrē. Amen
            O Lord increase my faith,
         
         
            
            A preparation to
Prayer.
            Ephes. 6.
            10 MY brethren, be strong in the
Lord, and in the strength of
his might.
            11 Put on the whole armour of
God, that ye may be able to stand
against the assaultes of the deuill.
            12 For wee wrestle not against
flesh and bloud, but against principalities,
against powers, against
worldly gouernours, the princes of
the darknes of this world.
            13 For this cause take vnto you
the whole armour of God, that ye
may bee able to resist in the euill
day. And hauing finished al things
stand fast.
            14 Stand I say, and your Ioynes
girded about with veritie, hauing
on the brest-plate of righteousnes.
            15 And your feet shod with the
preparation of the Gospel of peace
            16 And aboue all take vnto you
the shield of faith, wherewith you
may be able to quench all the fiery
darts of the wicked.
            
               
17 And take the helmet of saluation,
and the sword of the spirit;
which is the word of God.
            18 And praye alwaies with all
manner supplication in the spirit,
and watch thereunto with all perseuerance.
            Being thus furnished in the Lord,
wee may proceed on in our progresse,
with this precogitation following.
         
         
            
            A Psalme wherein is set
foorth the loue of God towardes vs,
wherein he accepteth vs to come vnto
him, for whatsoeuer we neede:
fit at all times to
be sung.
            
               O What a ioyfull thing it is
               to sing vnto his praise:
               Who louingly imbraceth his,
               and guides them in his waies?
            
            
               He calleth such as are opprest,
               and helpes them by his might,
               The poore oppressed gain thē rest,
               the wronged haue their right.
            
            
               O come therefore, and let vs fall
               and humble vs on knee,
               In heartie zeale, and then he shall
               of bond-men make vs free.
            
            
               His mercies great and manifold,
               forthwith he will extend:
               His fauours far surpasse the gold,
               whose glorie shall haue end.
            
            
               Let vs therefore sing out in zeale,
               that people all may know:
               
                  
That he to his doth still reueale
               his secretes here below.
            
            
               His heauenly hearts ease they shall find.
               who do performe his wil.
               But worldly men continue blind,
               vainely conceited still.
            
            
               O teach vs Lord, teach vs in loue,
               what we should do and say,
               Giue vs direction from aboue,
               how we should rightly pray.
            
            
               That we to thee may honour giue,
               and to our children show,
               How thou thy seruants dost relieue
               that want thine aide below.
            
         
      
      
         
            
            A motion to Praier, that
God by his holy Spirite will
teach vs how to
praie.
            
               LEt vs consider how
willing and readye
our good God is to
harken vnto the desires
of all such as
hunger and thirst for the riches of
his grace,God is willing and ready to giue his spirit to them that pray for it. without which such is
our pouertie, That we know not
what to aske as we ought:
               We knowe not what to aske without the spirite Rom. 8. 25, 27. 
               But the
spirite helpeth our infirmities, and
maketh request for vs with sighes
which can not be expressed. And
although that flesh and bloud bee
so corrupt,Flesh and bloud ignorant of things necessarie to be prayed for. that it alwaies groueleth
on the puddle of worldly cares
and the better part, namely the inner
man, in the meane time is forgotten,
and standeth indangered
to fall into manie euils, yet hauing
the earnest of this spirit,
               2. Cor, 1. 22. & 5. 5. we may
boldely come vnto our GOD,
who hath promised to sende the
same: if we aske it at his handes,

                  •
               e will giue it in such aboundance

and full measure that by the vertue
thereof we shall be able to pray
according to the wil of God.
               Rom. 8. 17 This
is the cōforter which Christ promised
to sende vnto vs,The Spirite of God the promised comforter euen the
holy Ghost,
               Ioh. 14. 26. which should teach vs
all things. And without it wee
know nothing.Wordes with out the spirit of God are vaine. And alas what
were it for vs to fall downe before
God in most reuerent outwarde
maner, pouring foorth a huge heap
of words from the lippes, not hauing
this inward director: Surely
it were but to spend time to no
purpose:The effect of the spirit. It is the Spirit that crieth
in our hartes, Abba father.
The spirit of a man knoweth only
the things that are of man:
               The spirit of man vnderstādeth onely outward things. 
               but the
Spirite of God knoweth and desireth
the things that are of God,
And the naturall man perceiueth
not the things of the spirit of God:
               1 cor 2. 11. vers. 14. 15.
               for they are folishnesse vnto him.
But he that hath the spirit of God,
               The spirit of God discerneth all things. 
               he discerneth all things. Let vs
therefore pray in the holy Ghost,
               Iud

               let vs pray alwaies with all maner
prayer and supplications in the
Spirite.
               Ephe. 6. 1.
            
            And let vs pray continually for



the ayde of this sacred guide, the
holy Spirit of God, which will
both mooue vs vnto, and direct vs
in all things that are requisite to
the due performance of this godly
exercise.
         
         
            The prayer for the ayd
of Gods Spirite.
            
               FOrasmuch (deare
Father) as euery
man liuing is of
him selfe before
thee as a beaste,
neither knowing
thee, nor the thinges concerning
their owne duties, vnto thee, I,
as one of the most peruerse, filthy
and corrupt, doe here humble my
selfe before thee, begging at thy
hands, that which thou hast promised
to giue vnto as many as ask
it of thee, thine holy spirit, that sacred
comforter, which reuealeth
thee and thy will to the simple and
ignorant, which also stirreth vp
the minds and inward affections
of thy children to call vpon thee, it



prepareth the hartes, and openeth
the mouthes of thy children, to celebrate
thy name. Bestow it therfore,
good father, bestow it vpon
me thy poore creature, and vpon
all thy children. And graunt that
although all of vs are of corrupt
affections, and of polluted lippes,
yet we may bee besprinkled with
that heauenly Isope, that wee
therby may haue our harts cleansed
from the corrupt affections of
the world, and the eyes of our vnderstandings
opened, that we may
see the good things that we should
aske, that our feet which are fettered
with the cares of vaine things
may be set at libertie, that we may
walk the right way vnto the kingdome
of heauen, that the hands of
our soules, may apprehend and
take hold of the riches and righteousnes
of thy son Christ Jesus:
And that by the aide of the saine
spirite, we may cast of all impediments,
lets and incumbrāces that
detaine vs from comming vnto
thee. Sanctifie mee within and
without, wash me and I shall be
whiter then snowe. Let thy truth



and thy spirit meet together in my
soule, that my praier may enter
into thy presence. And that thine
eares may incline vnto my humble
petitions: so shall I declare thy
louing kindnesse in the morning,
and thy truth in the night.
            Thou knowest whereof we be
made, thou forgettest not that we
are but dust, & vnprofitable people:
not fitte, apt, or able of our
selues to pray vnto thee, or praise
thy name.
            Wherefore good Father, enlighten
vs and teach our hartes
rightlie to cōceiue: & our tongues,
freelie to speake, what may be to
thy glory and our comfort: allure
vs to seeke thee, and graunt that
our harts may reioyce in thee, and
that we may liue and die in thee.
Amen.
            
            Let vs now seeke the Lord,
let vs seeke his strength, yea
let vs seeke his face continually.

                  Psal. 105: 4.
               
            
            O Lord increase our faith.
         
         
            
            A motion to prayer for
Queene Elizabeth.
            
               FOrasmuch as experience
it selfe
teacheth,As the Prince is, so are the people? that as
an euill Prince
draweth the greatest
parte of his
subiects vnto the
same profession and course of life
which the Prince professeth and
taketh, and so the Prince and people,
as it were bound vnto sinne,
passe together in the way of death:
so the good and godly prince, both
by good example of life, and by sacred
lawes, enciteth and winneth
his people to the heauenly course,
which tendeth to the obtaining of
freedome of soule and body to life
eternall. And as the former is sent
in iudgement vnto a people for
their punishment,Queene Elizabeth was giuen a token of Gods loue. and his long
continuance to be lamented, so is
the other giuen as a blessing, and a
most speciall token of the loue of
God, for whose long and prosperous
raine, euery subiect is in dutie



bound louingly, zealously, and
faithfully, to pray vnto God.The blessings that we haue by Queene Elizabeth
            
            If so, what haue we to say: what
haue we to do, and what haue we
to think of our gracious Queene,
chosen of the Lord him selfe, and
miraculously preserued, and louingly
giuen vs for our most speciall
good, by whome wee haue the
freedom and libertie of the Gospel,
which is the path to our heauenly
hearts ease, which before her days
we knowe was stopt by with the
briers and thornes of persecution
and death, and nowe laide open againe
as a most euident token that
the lord by her sacred gouernment
will lead the people through the
wildernes of all the diuisions, hurliburlies,
& tumults in this world,
and to that end hath raisd vp manie
zealous, graue, and religious
Counsellors, and godly ministers,
who do direct the whole progresse
and marching on of her obedient
people in the path of a godly profession
of the word of God, wherby
at length they shal com to that
pleasant land of knowledge, wher
they shall euen in this life enioy



the heauenlie harts ease, the peace
of a good conscience without reproofe.
Wee must haue consideration of our duties to our gracious Queene for many causes. Therefore it is most expedient
that we should call to minde
our duties which we ow vnto her
Maiestie, not only in regard of y•
commandement, which Paule setteth
down to Timothy, That supplications,
praiers, intercessions, &
giuing of thāks,
               1. Tim. 2. 1. 2. 
               shuld be made for
kings, and such as are in authority:
but also in regard of the dayly experiēce
of her most sacred gouernment,
which is such & so gratious,No nation hath had like benefite as England hath had, not only of the Gospell, but of long peace.
as the like benefite hath not beene
extended to any nation before vs.
And therefore that we may auoid
negligence in that behalfe, let vs
according to the former counsell
of Paule, pray for her Maiesties
prosperous continuance amongst
vs.We must pray for our gracious Queen that God will blesse her with all comforts. Let vs make intercession for
her perseuerance and going on,
in her sacred dutie to God, as she
hath begunne, and that hee will
preuent the euils which her aduersaries
maliciously pretend against
her. And finally, let vs giue
thankes for her so long comfortable
being our nursing mother, that



shee may so continue (if it please
God) to the shutting vp, and finishing
of all time vpon the earth,
that she with vs, and we with her
may meet our sauiour Christ Jesus
together in the cloudes, when
we shall enioy our absolute harts
ease in heauen.
            If we consider the perillous estate
of our tune wherein wee
liue,The perill of our time giueth vs occasion to pray for Queene Elizabeth. and the danger of our dayes,
wee shall finde great occasion to
humble our selues before the Lord
in prayer for her, that the bright
beames of his fauour may shine
vnto vs euen in her (who as we
see) hungreth and thirsteth for the
peace, comfort, and good of vs her
people,And especial cause to praye for Queene Elizabeth. who being taken from vs,
we know not whether the Lorde
will send vs (in regard of our forgetting
his so great a benefite in
her) a Dauid or a Saule: and therefore
it behooueth vs to pray that
God wil lengthen her daies vpon
the earth, for the further comfort
of his Church.The dangers of forraine countries.
            
            If we looke into the present estate
of our neighbours in forraine
partes, it will (if we be not



carelesse) strike vs with terrour,giue vs cause also to pray for Queene Elizabeth.
least that God for our sins should
also turne our peace into warre,
our plentie into want, & our comfort
in her, to miserie and trouble
by forraine enemies.
            Let this and many other deepe
occasions, carry vs into a desire to
crie vnto our God for his continuall
loue towardes her, whose
prosperitie is ours, whose health
is our happines, and whose continuance
is our comfort. The right
hand of the King of kinges holde
her vp.
         
         
            The Prayer for the
Queene.
            
               OUr omnipotent and
mighty God, that gouernest
Kinges and
kingdomes, whose
power exceedeth the
power of all Potentates of the
earth, we acknowledge thy mercy,
we commend thy wisedome, and
praise thy mightie power: in that
thou hast so like a louing Father,



established the peace of thy church
here in this our land: and in that
thou hast cast out the aduersaries
of Israell, and planted vs, as thine
owne people in their steeds. Which
waightie worke (O good father)
such is thy strength, that thou hast
enabled thine handmaide, not by
tyrannie, but by truth: not by crueltie,
but by louing kindnesse, to
establish in this our realme: who
hath confirmed the same to thy obedience:
and hath reduced many
of thin aduersaries from disobeying
theee, to loue thee, from not
knowing thee, to serue thee. And
therefore, good father, we magnifie
thy name, we extol thee with praise:
And so much the more, good father
because she hath through thee, driuen
back our enemies, and in thy
name, and by thy power, troden
downe such as rose vp against her
and vs: and aboue all, for that vnder
her we haue tasted how sweet,
louing, and comfortable thou art
towards vs. And thy fame in her
is spread from one nation to another
people, yea from one end of y•
earth to the other: and all the nations



of the world do see and consider
that great is her God, for the
wonders that thou hast done for
her, are maruelous in the eies euē
of her enemies: for when men rose
vp against her, they preuailed not,
but stumbled and fell. The experience
of thy continuall fauour encreaseth
yet daily: euen to thy perpetuall
praise. Wherefore, good father,
be still mindfull of her, and
blesse vs in her, continue thy louing
kindnes, and make her daies
ioyful that she may see the increase
of thy glorie to shine in this land,
as the Sun in his strength. And
let her foes be beaten downe on al
sides, let not one of thē be able to
stand in her presence: graunt her
continuall peace and true happines,
gouerne her well, and sanctifie
her affections, and beautifie her
crowne with the glorious ornaments
of godlinesse, of wisedome,
of knowledge, of faith, of zeale, &
true humilitie before thee, that she
may continue a spectacle of sinceritie
to all posterities. And that the
Princes of the earth may see her
godly proceedings, and in a godly



emulation, endeuor more & more
to follow her good and gracious
example. And let al her people practise
euermore to serue thee, and to
celebrate thine euerlasting praises
in her behalfe. Hearken vnto her
from heauen and vnto vs for her,
behold her from aboue, and graunt

louing Father in Jesus
Christ, pure and holye, I
Confesse vnto thee mine vnrighteousnes



which maketh mee vnworthie
to come before thee, not
onely in regard of mine originall
corruption, which I traduced
from disobedient Adam: But in
regard of my continuall sinnes,
and actuall euils which I daylye
commit against thee, whereby I
can not but become offensiue vnto
thee, and euer lo

eyes. But a 
                  •
               s such is mine
estate, being considered, as it is in
and of my selfe, that I can bring
forth no better fruites, then the
tree of Adams disobedience, whose
rootes as they are sinne, so beare
they sinne in me, and consequently
procure death and destruction.
But deare Father, as by Adam
sinne entred and tooke hold of him
selfe and all his posteritie. So by
thy Sonne we are all Justified
by our adoption into his righteousnesse
of thy free loue: If wee
take hold of thy promises in him,
and become obedient as hee is obedient
vnto thee. And therefore
deare Father howsoeuer our corruptions
as they are in vs, of our
selues haue be wrapped vs in



bondage to sinne and death, let
thy Sonnes merites bee vnto
vs a sufficient ransome for our euerlasting
libertie, not onely to
come freely vnto the throne of thy
grace, but in the ende to obtaine
the ioyes eternal with him in heauen.

            O Lord increase our faith.
         
         
            A motion to a Prayer for
the forgiuenes of our
sinnes.
            
               HAuing thus cast our
selues downe before
our God in true humilitie,
wherein wee
haue acknowledged
that we are so polluted with sins,
and so tyed with the chaines of
death, that there is no euasion or
meane in our selues, or by our
selues to escape the snares of Sathan,
that lurketh lik a roaring Lyon
seeking whō he may deuoure.
We must now endeuor to findout
the meane, how to be made at one



with,We must seeke howe to be reconciled to God. and be reconciled vnto our
God againe. Wherin thus much
we are first to consider, that as by
Adam all men haue sinned, and
haue deserued death by sinne: euen
so by Christ we are clensed from
sinne, and stand againe in the fauour
of God, the father by faith in
him: Whom also we haue to be an
Advocat to God our heauenly father,
and he it is that obtaineth
pardon for all our sinnes.
               Christ reconcileth vs to God our ostended heauēly father. 
               It is the
passion and most innocent death
of Iesus Christ, the immaculate
Lambe, which is a sufficient reconciliation
for our offences. And
therfore he saith, If any man sinne,
he hath an Advocate with the father,
euen Iesus Christ the righteous.
That is, if any man acknowledge
his offences truely before
God, and that he is sinfull, impure
and corrupt, and doeth faithfullie
submit himselfe vnto the fauour of
God in Christ, without standing
to iustifie himself righteous.
                  
                     •
                  ho hath the benefit of Christs death Such
a one hath the benifite of Christes
death, and such a one shal be partaker
of the deserts of Christ: wherin
he shall obtaine pardon for all his



sinnes. But he that will not thus
throw himselfe downe before the
Lorde, and crie out against his
owne vnworthynes, and say that
he is a sinner, and vnable of himselfe
to obtaine remission of sins,
there is no place of mercy for such
a one. For Christ came to call, not
ye righteous,
               Mat. 19. 13. such as were in their
owne conceit,1. Tim▪ 15 holy, pure, iust, and
without sinne, but sinners (such as
did so confesse & acknowledge thē
selues) to repentance.
               Whome Christ came to cal Such sinners
as are sorie for their sinnes,
& repent them of their euils: such
Christ himselfe calleth, saying
Come vnto me Al ye that labour,
and are heauy laden,
               2. Pet. 3. 9. 
               and I wil ease
you. Our God is patient, and wold
haue no man perish, but woulde
that al men shuld come to repentance.
And therefore, hee sent his
sonne Christ Jesus,Mat. 2. 28 to giue himselfe
a ransome for all that repent
and truely beleeue in him.
            We were in bondage and captiuitie,
               Christ is our ransom
and he most franckly tooke
vpon him to ransome vs with a
great price,Mat. 26. 28 euen his bloud, which
bloud he shed for many, for the remission



of sinnes: not for all, but
for such as truly repent & amend
their liues:They that runne on stil in sinne haue no profite of the merites of Christ. for they that runne on
still in their sinnes, howsoeuer
they flatter themselues, they are
left vnto themselues, and the merits
of Christ worke not for them:
his death to them is none aduantage.
And we therefore must take
heed, left that we deceiue our selues
with this,Ioh. 1. 19. 
               that he is the Lambe of
God that taketh away the sins of
the world And that thereby euery
man in the world is so included, &
euery mans sins by him so taken
away without repentance,The effects of faith that we
haue scope to sinne, because hee taketh
it away. But wee must take
hold of his merits by faith, which
faith will worke in vs a detestation

               re to, reforme
euill in our selues, and to be reconciled
vnto God in amendment of
lyfe. For it appeareth that the
whole world was polluted and defiled
with sinne,The whole world was dead in sin. and that the whol
world naeded a meane to be cured
of that great miserie, and to that
end came Christ, men to saue all
that repent and beleeue the Gospel:



to such is the glad tidyinges
of saluation sent, as well vnto the
Gentile as to the Jewe, to the
bond,All are called to salvation. as to the free, to all people
and nations of the world, Wherein
appered the vnspeakeable loue
of God, not that we loued him first
but that he loued vs, and sent his
sonne to be a reconciliation for our
sinnes,

               by whose stripes wee
are healed.

                God of my saluation,
I haue acknowledged
my sins vnto
thee, I haue not
hidden mine iniquities.
For thus (my good God) I
thought, I wil confesse my wickednes
against my selfe vnto thee, O
Lord, forgiue the punishment of
my sinnes, vnto thee O Lord, I cry,
O my strength be not far from me
lest that if thou answere me not, I
be like them that goe downe vnto



the pit. Remember not the sinnes
of my youth, nor my rebellions,
but according to thy kindnesse remember
thou me, euen for thy
goodnesse sake remember thou
mee: gracious and righteous thou
art, and thou teachest sinners in
the way. O turne thy face towards
mee, let thy louing fauour
and mercie euermore be extended,
for I am miserable, sinfull and
poore. And I come vnto thee the
fountaine of all helpe, forgiue my
sinnes, wash me and I shall bee

kindnesse, who haste euer
bene readie to forgiue, euer readie

returne from their euill ways, as
appereth by Dauid, by Peter, by
Marie Magdalene, and many other
who repenting their sinnes, haue
found fauour. Our fathers called
vpon thee, and thou didst heare
them, they trusted in thee, and wer
deliuered, they depended vppon
thee, and were not confounded.
Wherefor haue mercie vpon mee,



O God, haue mercy vpon me according
to thy great mercies, and
according to the multitude of thy
compassions do away mine iniquities.
O cleanse mee from my secrete
sinnes, and couer my known
sinnes with the righteousnesse of
thy Sonne▪ remooue mine iniquities
farre away from mee, and be
not angry with thy seruant for euer.
O enter not into iudgement

thee be iustified, what shall
become of me, who haue

appeale vnto thee, I flie vnto thee,
I rest vpon thee, leaue thy displesure
against mee, and howsoeuer
weake and vnable I be to stande

strength hold me vp, and say vnto
me, feare not, for my grace is sufficient
for thee. I take hold of thy
loue, and I rest vpon thy fauour
in Christ, reiect mee not, though
there bee no good in mee: powre
downe that absolute good thing,
euen thy grace, and let it direct me
to amendement of my corrupt life.



Thou hast said that thou art wel
pleased in Christ thy Sonne: in
him be thou also pleased with me,
and receiue mee againe into thy
loue through his merites, by
whome euery sinner receiueth free
accesse vnto thee. And although I
for my part (most louing God) be
a vessell full of faultes and filthynes,
although I be no more worthy
to bee called thy Sonne, although
I bee a seruant most vnprofitable,
yea, a withered and starued
branch, who haue lost the
quicknes and vigor of thy blessed
spirit, and am good of mine owne
proper nature, for nothing but for
the fire. Yet, good Father, haue
mercy vpō me, haue patience with
me, cast me not from thee, but rather
endue me againe with a new
spirite, and a liuely feeling of thy
pleasure, and will, and ablenesse to
do thereafter, that I may fill vp
the residue of my daies in sinceritie,
in holines, in righteousnesse,
and in the due seruice of thee, in
faith vnfained, and in all singlenes
of heart and soule, that from
henceforth, insteede of straying



from thee, I may dwell, and bee
shrouded vnder the shadow of thy
winges, that in steede of sinne,
which heretofore hath miscaried
me, I may imbrace pietie, godlynesse,
and true zeale: and in steed of
ignorance, whereby I haue gone
so long astray, I may take hold of
the knowledge of thy sau

And let it be as a lanterne vnto
my feet, & a light vnto my pathes,
that so I may rest safe in thee,
through a liuely faith which neuer
deceiueth And graunt that I may
carefully performe what thou likest,
howsoeuer disliking it be vnto
me, and may watchfully auoid
what thou lothest, howsoeuer liking
it be vnto me. For I acknowledge,
good father, that flesh and
bloud sauor nothing of the things
belonging vnto saluation: but I
waite in the spirite for thy louing
kindnesse and mercie promised in
Christ thy Sonne, in whome I
am bolde with deepe sighes of the
heart to crie, Lorde forgiue mine
offences, remit mine iniquities,
couer my sinnes, and lay not my
former euils vnto my charge.
            
            
               
Good Father, giue the knewledge
of saluation vnto me, and to

quench all the corrupt motions of

               But we poore sinners may cry out
               against our selues and say:
               Our purest deeds like filthy clout,
               our grosse conceits bewray.
            
            
               No stay is in our crooked will,
               a rash consent we giue:
               To teach delight, that seekes to kil
               our soules, wherein we liue.
            
            
               But now thy sauing health extend,
               thy mercies sweete prepare.
               And salue our sores: let vs amend,
               and breake thou Sathans snare.

            A motion to a praier, tending
to the obtayning of true
mortification of our sinfull affections,
without the which
we cannot please
God.
            
               HAuing acknowledged
our sins, & corrupt
affections before
our God, and in
Christ his son, hauing
obtained attonment
with him, and yet resting in
our selues sinfull and miserable,
& of our selues vnable to obtaine
the fauour of God, and being obtained,
not able to stand without
his continuall aide: we must seeke
by all meanes to frame all our
actions in his feare, knowing this
that it is not inough for vs to
haue found the meane how to bee
reconciled vnto God,We must seeke to keepe the fauour of God. but we must
vse the meanes also (being reconciled)
to retaine and keepe him out
fauourable God still, which is by
mortifying of those euils in vs,



which breake foorth vnto his dishonour.
We must leaue sinne Yet
this is not inough, Wee also must
cleaue vnto righteousnesse, and
exercise our callings to Gods glory:
It is not enough to forsake sin, but wee must cleaue vnto righteousnesse. we must not onely eschue euil,
but we must doo good, we may
not onely seeke peace and attonement
with God, but we must ensue
and follow it.
               Psal. 1. 1. &c. It is not inough
for vs not to walke in the counsail
of the scorner, and wicked persons
or not to stand in the way of sinners,
but we must delight in the
law of the Lord, and that not for a
time, and then to retourne to our
vomite and vanity againe, according
to the course of the worlde,
who thinketh not inough to cease
from euill for a time, and to serue
the Lord at seasons ordinary, but
wee must exercise our selues in his
word, and that continually, day &
night:
               Psal, 1. 8, And we must gird vp the
loynes of our mindes, and be sober,
and trust perfectly on that
grace that is brought vnto vs in
the reuelation of Jesus Christ, as
obedient children, not fashioning
our selues vnto the former facts of



ignorance, but as he which hath
called vs is holy, so let vs be holy
in all maner of conuersation, pleasing
God, Not making our boast
of our owne harts desire,
               1 Pet. 1. 13. 14. 15. 
               as the couetous,
who blesseth himself in his
owne wealth and prosperitie, and
contemneth the Lord: grounding
the foundation of our hope vpon
vain things,Thinges may offend God. which cary coulor to be lawfull wher
                  •
               by oftentimes
we are stirred vp to execute things
offensiue vnto God, which yet
may carry coulor of warrant by
the law of man, wherin the inward
affections of the hart appeere not
only not mortified, but rather reuiued
to sinne. If we duely looke
into our desires, we shall find out
few or none that truely tende to
that mortification which is required,
but rather to the aduancing of
the pride of our flesh against the
humility of the spirite.The first 
                     〈…〉
                   become a godly man Let none
thinke it irkesome or tedious to
leaue this, that the first step to
the perfection of a godly man, is,
to deny himselfe: which deniall, is
keeping vnder of all the corrupt
motions which rise in our selues,
and couet to breake foorth in action



contrary to that which our God
hath commanded: and if that bee
hard to performe, that which is
further required is more hard, and
they are the words of Christ himselfe,
Mat. 16. 24 which I dare not deny.Mar. 8. 34. 
               If any
man (saith he) will follow mee,
let him forsake himselfe: and yet
that not inough, Let him take vp
his crosse and follow me. And in
another place, If any man will
come after me, let him deny himselfe,
               Luk. 9. 23.
               and take vp his crosse dayly
and follow me. We are commaunded
to forsake our selues: and to
deny our selues, wherein we may
see the great necessity of this mortification,
and how seuerely it is
enioyned vs. If we forsake our
selues, whether shall wee flye to
leaue our selues? we must vnderstand
that we, as long as we are
in the body, are at home in the
flesh, where many corruptions
lurke, and therefore if we will forsake
our selues,We must forsake our selues. we must suppresse
the euils in our selues, and by the
spirite ascend vp from our carnall
habitation, and dwell with the
Lord in continuall contemplation



of his will, in a dayly desire to bee
with him: thus also must we deny
our selues: for when the motions
of the flesh do, as it were intreate
the minde and soule to consent
vnto that which is vnlawful,
wee must presently checke our
selues, and in an inward godly
aunsweare, repell the proud desires
of the flesh,We must deny the desires of the flesh. 
               Which sauour
not the things that appertaine vnto
life, but vnto death, and therefore
necessary to be denied. Thus
if we carry our affections within
the compasse of the Lordes good
pleasure, we shall then easely attaine
vnto the other part, namely
to take vp the crosse, that is, accept
willingly the miseries, troubles
afflictions, and persecutions,
which may happen vnto vs: but
so long as wee are carried away
with the alluringes of the world
and the flesh, we shall say as Peter
said vnto his maister (sauo
                  •
               ing of
the flesh, and not of the spirite)
Saue thy selfe,
               How dangerous it is to 
                     〈…〉
                  
                
               go not to Ierusalem
to fall into trouble: so shall we alwayes
couet pleasing thinges, but
poyson
                  •
               d things, as riches, preferment,



honor, ease, idlenesse, negligence
in our callinge, excesse in
buildinges, superfluous diet most
diuelish attire, and what euill accompanieth
not this:Many grosse faults are thought no faults. It is thought
an easy fault, nay, no fault, to
be enuious, to bee a glutton, to be
drunken, to be a blasphemer to receiue
rewardes against iustice, to
be partiall in iudgement, if it leane
but a little awry, and especially if
it be not seene of men. But this
liberty of the flesh will be one day
restrayned, and Gods mercies deteined
from such libertines, who
although they cannot, nor will
forsake or deny themselues as yet,
it may please God to rowse them
out of this forgetfullnesse, & strike
their hearts with such a feeling
of his displeasure, that they may
cast off their affections of the flesh,
and measure all their thoughtes,
woordes, and workes by the spirite:Prayer necessary to mortification
and therefore it is good to
pray vnto the Lorde for his assistance
therein, knowing this, that
he that cannot forsake himself, and
deny himselfe, howsoeuer hee flattereth
his owne security, and integrity,



wherein he foolishly persuadeth
hymselfe that hee followeth
Christ, he is far from Christ, and
surely he will say vnto him in the
last day,No excuse will serue. 
               I know thee not, It is
not the buying of a farme, the prouing
of oxen, nor the marriage of
a wife, that can excuse vs, continuing
in the flesh and fleshly desires.
            It is not inough to obserue the
letter of the law:The obseruation of the letter of the law excuseth not. For then wee
may still continue manslayers in
wrath towards our brethren, wee
may commit adultery, by lusting
we may sinne in our communication,
exceeding yea and nay. And
therefore must we abstaine from
all apparance of euill,
               1. Thess. 7. 5. 22. and in all
purity both of soule, mind and body,
through the power and strength
of the spirite of God, endeuor
continually to forsake and deny
our selues, being made free from
sinne, let vs become the seruants
of righteousnes,
               Rom. 6. 18. 19 
               and let vs giue all
our members instruments of righteousnes,
in holynes and purenes.
When we were in the flesh, sin had
power in our members, bringing



foorth fruites vnto death.
               Rom. 7. 5. 6. 
               But now
being deliuered from sin, we must
serue the Lord in newnesse of spirite,
               No good dwelleth in our flesh.
               and not in our old conuersation
Ther dwelleth no good thing
in our flesh, for we may feele continuall
rebellions therein, which
repugne the lawe of the spirite:
which law giueth strickt commandement
against the affections of
the flesh, and would haue all the
corrupt motions therof to be vtterly
denied. And therfore let vs
fight manfully against all euils, in
what degree so euer they rise against
the spirite.
            Wee must carefully watch the
doors of our hearts,We must be watchfull against sinne. with the weapons
of the spirite, least that sinne
creepe into our inwarde partes,
which obtayning the consent of
our minds, yea but a little, it will
take such aduantage by pleading
possession, that it will be harde to
remoue it. And therefore let vs
preuent the entry of sinne, by mortifying
the deedes of the flesh, so
shall it neuer beare fruite in vs to
death.Rom. 1. 11
                     •
                  
                
               And surely if the spirite that
raised vp Christ dwell in vs our



mortall bodies shall be quickened
by the same spirite:
               How wee may bee knowne to be the sons of God. And so quickned,
that it shall bring foorth the
fruites of true mortification in vs.
And then shall we be knowne to
be the sonnes of God, euen by that
badge of denying our selues.
            Let vs pray therefore vnto the
Lord that he wil sanctifie vs within,Rom. 11 16.
that he will make our whole
lumpe holy▪ the roote and the branches
holy, If our heartes be pure,
all our actions will likewise be
pure. We must hunger and thirst
for righteousnes, if wee will bee
blessed with the righteous. Wee
must runne the race of the godly if
we will receiue the reward wyth
the godly: we must subdue our euils,
and conquer our corrupt motions,
as doo the godly, if we will
bee crowned with the godly. We
must haue our hearts, hands, & all
the partes of our bodies knit together
in one consent,The inward affections and outward actions must concurre. to the true
forsakinge and denyinge of our
selues. The inward shew and outward
affections must concurre in
the same: so shall we be both outwardly
approoued and inwardly



assured that wee haue the spirit of
trueth, and so consequently that
we are the Lordes, who will alwayes
attend our safety, if wee
thus carrie our selues before him.
            Reade the 15. Psalme, learne it
and haue it in thine heart, and obserue
it in thy proceedings, and it
shall teach thee what it is that is
required of thee to become a fit
man to enter into the kingdome
of God.
         
         
            The Prayer for mortification.
            
               O Righteous God, &
mercyfull Father,
who art so pure and
cleane, that there is
no euill dwelleth
with thee, no corruption resteth in
thy sight, But he that walketh vprightly,
he that worketh righteousnesse;
and speaketh the truth from
his hart, he is accepted with thee:
such a one thou louest, such a one
thou receiuest, and such a one
shall rest in thy holy hill. But on



the contrarie, hee that walketh
after his owne hearts desires, hee
that yeldeth vnto the corrupt motions
of flesh and bloud, and cloaketh
iniquitie vnder the shew of
godlinesse: such a one doest thou
hate, such a one doth thy soule abhorre,
and such a one shall not
come neere thee: hee may pray and
shall not be heard, he may cry and
call, but thou wilt not helpe him.
Wherefore my good God, sith
there is required in all men the
sinceritie and true inwarde zeale
of the soule, and an absolute killing
of the motions of the flesh,
and mortifying af all fleshly affections.
Looke fauourably vppon
me, in whome doe dwell an innumerable
troope of foolish fantasies,
a heape of sinfull affections, I find
and feele, that though many times
to will, be present with me, yet to
perfo
                  •
               rme is not in my power:
sinne preuaileth, and deathe
through sinne swalloweth mee vp:
so that I rest in darkenesse of sin,
and that by giuing scope vnto
mine owne peruerse will: And so
long good Father, as I dwell in



this house of flesh and bloud, detayned
downe-warde wyth the
pleasing and entising things therof.
I cannot maister my corrupt
desires. I cannot bridle mine affections:
but in steede of true
mortification, I breake out into
such outrage, by consent of all my
members, that my affections extend
from conceiuing euill, to performing
of euill, from desiring to
sinne, to commit sinne, euen with
greedinesse. And yet such is my
miserable estate, being thus in my
selfe, that flesh and bloud flattereth
it selfe, and concludeth, that
whatsoeuer I purpose in an euill
desire, so that it breake not foorth
into open grosse wickednesse, that
I am holy enough, that I am as
sincere as is requisite, and that I
stand too fearefull of thy iudgements,
when thou knowest, that
all and euery the least conceite of
sin, breaking into action, in what
couert measure or meane degree
soeuer, it by and by endaungereth
my soule, and deserueth suddaine
iudgement. And therefore let it
please thee, that as thy deere sonne



through thy surpassing loue, hath
reconciled all such vnto thy fauor
againe, that are truely penitent:
so let thy holy spirite continually
worke to the taming of vnbridled
flesh, and let me by the same spirite,
neuer leaue more and more to
seeke and endeuour to subdue my
grosse affections, vntill I come to
a true and absolute mortification
of all▪ t
                  •
               e euils that rise vp in mee:
so shall I denie and forsake my
selfe and follow thee: so shall I
leaue my selfe and come vnto thee:
I shal hate my selfe and loue thee:
I shal conquere my self and serue
thee.
            Good Father, thou seest that
I am most weake, and without
the continuall woorking of thy
grace, I can not in any measure
suppresse my desires, but rather
they the more strongly rise in me:
I cannot denie my selfe, but rather
I deny the working of grace
in me, I do not onely not mortifie
my sinnes, but sinne rather reuiueth
and becommeth strong in me
insomuch as it bringeth forth fruit
not vnto life, but vnto death.



Therefore I beseech thee sanctifie
me, that I defile not my selfe with
the filthinesse of the flesh, or fleshly
thinges, howsoeuer they seeme to
please me. Let me not be deceiued
with the pleasing iudgement of
wordly men, who affirme sinne
to bee no sinne, darkenesse to bee
light, and light to bee darkenesse:
Atheisme to be religion, and sanctitie
to be sinne: couetousnesse to
be good husbandry, and charity to
be folly, hatred and reuenge to be
manhoode, and loue to bee cowardice,
swearing to be courage, and
meekenesse to be madnesse, pride to
be decencie, and comelinesse to bee
beastly. Oh good Father, many
are the enormities that rise vp in
vs, & defended not only as things
tollerable, but as things laudable:
oh mortifie therfore, mortifie these
euils, let vs no longer be besotted
with ye filthy fashions of the corrupt
world: extinguish the flames
of carnall desires, represse the raging
lusts of the flesh▪ and graunt
that we may shun, and with due
watchfulnesse auoyde all thinges
that haue but the apparance of cuil:



that being thus inwardly subdued,
I may make outward profession,
that whatsoeuer I doo, it
may be simply grounded vpon the
truth of a good cōscience, in singlenesse
of the spirite, in newnesse of
life. And let me still retaine this
in memorie, that I can not follow
mine owne will, and thy woord.
I may not impart my affections
to the deedes of the flesh, and the
woorkes of the spirite. I can not
walke in darknesse and light, the
way of death, and the way of life,
I cannot serue thee and sinne.
Direct me therefore▪ good Father,
direct mee in my whole life, and seperate
mee from the worlde and
worldly things, and let me dwell
with thee in all godly meditations,
and contemplations, and let
mee vse the things in this world,
as if I vsed them not, let mee
liue in this life, as if I were dead
to sinne: and beeing thus truelie
mortified in the body, and quickned
in the spirite, let mee looke in
continuall watchfulnesse, for the
dissolution of this my mortall bodie,
that my soule may ascende:



and in the ende both in soule and
bodye, I may for euermore enioy
the eternall ioyes of heauen.
Amen.
            
            O Lord increase our faith.
         
         
            This tendeth to a true deniall of
ourselues, in mortifying our affections,
whereby we ouer greedily
imbrace the pleasures
of this world.
            
               COrrupt and filthy are we all,
               the proudest man is dust:
               No comfort here: we liue in thral.
               and linger here in lust.
               The sweetest of delights that we
               can chuse to please our will:
               what brings it vs? who doth not se
               that pleasures turne to ill?
            
            
               Art thou a mā whose state is great
               if pompe exalt thy mind:
               What then? Thy soul with sin impleat
               bewraies thy plesures blind.
               A dolefull bell doth wait to ring.
               when thou secure shalt die:
               what song of glory canst thou sing
               when corpes in graue shall lie?
            
            
               
               What shal auaile thy lofty lookes?
               whereat the poore doe quake.
               And what thy Machauilian bokes

                  ke?
               Thy brauest buildings high in state
               thy golden gods but dust:
               Thy Thrasoes & thy Gnatoes mate
               no more shall serue thy lust.
            
            
               Thy formal friends that fawne on thee
               & please the time for gaine:
               wil sigh in shew: but shrink frō the
               whē most thou groanst in pain:
               The rich aray which here doth make
               thy stinking carcasse gay:
               Thy foe, when thou art gone, will take
               & laugh; & thou in clay.
            
            
               No state so strong, no man so sure,
               no office or degree:
               Can graunt vs warrant to endure,

            A motion to Prayer tending to
the obtaining of the kingdome
of God.
            
               IT hath pleased Almightie
G
                  •
               D in
greate measure of
mercye to call vs
home vnto him, to
confesse our sins, which although
they be great & many, yet through
the abundance of his loue, he hath
taken them away through the merits
of his sonne. And onely craueth
this, that we wil forsake our
selues, and follow him: wherein
we are mooued to seeke the Lord
our God▪ and to frame our selues
to that course that may bring vs
wholy vnto him, being the fountaine
of all goodnes, which we can
receiue either in soule or body
            
               
And forasmuch as hee saw the
corruptions of our heartes to bee
such, as they brought forth oftentimes,
peruerse and contrarie desires,
tending most especially to
worldly and fleshly things: He in
fauour directed vs especially what
to craue at his hands, namely, To
seeke the kingdome of God & the
riches and righteousnesse thereof.
And then shall all things necessary
both to body and soule bee administred
vnto vs. In so much as
it appeareth that the foundation
of al our petitions, tending to bodily
reliefe, must bee builded, not
vpon our owne rash conceites, as
to aske what our naturall disposition
will lead vs vnto: But to
seek the word of God, the knowledge
of Christ, and the things of
the body beeing of small moment,
shall be cast vpō vs by the louing
prouidence of our good God. Although
in deede the kingdome of
God bee not meate and drincke, it
cōsisteth not in the outward man,
as in promotion, in riches, in beauty,
in honour, in health, in friends,
nor in whatsoeuer pleasures of



flesh and bloud: no, not in ceremonies
and traditions inuented
by man: not in the outward word,
neyther in whatsoeuer is seene
with the external eye. But it consisting
in spirituall feeling, taste,
and vse, in the sincere and pure
knowledge, exercise, and comfort
of the Gospell of Jesus Christ,
perfourming the will of God here
in earth.
            And heerein it is required,Luke. 6. 20. that

must frame and conforme our
wordes, workes and thoughts,
to doe the will of our heauenly
father.
            To him we must fall downe to
be strengthened in faith▪ without
which we cannot reteine this kingdome,

word: which that it may bee purely

                  ••
               
without vaine glory: receiued



and practised, without faltring or
fear we must pray vnto our God,
who hath promised and will perfourme,
to send vs his ayde, to
keepe vs vpright in this glorious
path to eternall life. And wee
must pray vnto him, that hee will
make our vnderstandinges capable
of the trueth of his will,
and what hee requireth at our
handes in seekinge of this hys
kingdome. That he wil frame our
liues in all simplicity of faith, submitting
our selues wholy vnto
his word, casting downe our own
imaginations, and euerie proude
conceit of our selues: that through
meekenesse, in true knowledge and
obedience, we may be made meete
partakers of the euerlasting kingdome
of God.
            Hauing obtained this spirituall
feeling of the will of God, in his
word, and being sealed vp through
faith in a longing desire▪ for al spirituall
perfection, let vs proceede
to the execution of our callinges,
which may aunsweare the commaundement
of God heerein. Let
vs continually seeke new and dayly



meanes by hearing the woorde
preached, by stirring vp one of an
other, and by giuing sacred examples
of vertue and godlynesse,
that our callings may bee made
sure, to be founded and established
in this kingdome.
            Then may wee freely approach
vnto our God, and he will receiue
vs: we may cal on him, and he wil
heare vs: we may beg of him, and
he wil giue vs al things necessary
for body and soule. Hee is our almighty
king, and he will defende
vs: he is our mercifull God, and
he will relieue vs: and hee is our,
mercifull father, and he will feede
vs, cloath vs, and teach vs. And
at last, he wil crowne vs with the
glorie of his sonne, hee will make
vs as the saintes in heauen, and
we shall receiue the inheritance of
euerlasting blisse. And therefore
let vs seeke and praie vnto him,
that wee may obtaine this principall
and chiefe foundation of
all true comfortes in this life, the
kingdome of his Sonne Christ
Jesus.
         
         
            
            The prayer for the kingdome
of God.
            
               O Most gracious God
and louing father, it
hath pleased thee to
commaund vs, first,
& before all things,
to seeke thy kingdome, and the riches
& righteousnes thereof, with
promise that then al things necessary
for body and soule shal be giuen
vs: wherfore good father, sith
that our vnablenes is such, that
we cannot attaine vnto this high
matter of our selues, vouchsafe to
prepare our heartes, that at this
time and alwaies, wee may aboue
all things, hunger and thirst for
this righteousnesse, the absolute
meane of our true comfort: without
which all our comfort is but
care: our wisdome, but foolishnes,
our glory, but shame: our riches,
but pouertie: our godlines impietie:
and all our praiers sin. Wherefore
good father, I humbly praye
thee in the behalfe of all thy children,
that thou wilt poure into our



hearts, a godly consideration of
our imperfections, not being endued
with this absolute integrity:
that we may see our pouerty, & nakednes,
not being enriched & cloathed
with this riches, & weedes of
sanctitie: that wee may feele how
ready we are to pine for want of
this foode of our soules, thy sacred
woord, the glorious Gospell of
Christ, wherein consisteth this
heauenly kingdome, which kingdome
O Lord teach vs to find.
            Endue vs with thy holy spirit:
poure into our harts that sacred
gift which thou hast left for
our comfort, to leade vs to this
kingdome, that may direct vs in
all truth, that may manifest in vs
the knowledge and exercise of thy
word, wherein resteth that spirituall
happinesse, which heere by
faith, we see as a shadow farre off,
which one day shall be manifest to
our absolute ioy and saluation.
            In the meane time good Father,
sanctifie our hearts with heauenly
contemplations, and sanctified
meditations, that our ioye
which now is but in part, may be



dayly enlarged through the diuine
fruites of loue to thy law, faith in
thy promises, and of hope that our
ioy shall be full at the appearinge
of thy sonne. So shall the kingdome
of thy sonne appeare in vs,
and wee which wander in the
darknesse of this polluted worlde,
shall appeare manifestly to bee the
heires of thy kingdome, through
faith testified by the fruites of a
sanctified life.
            And to the end good father, that
thy kingdome may dayly more and
more appeare and increase, graunt
free and comfortable passage to
thy word and Gospell of Christ,
that it may be plainely, purely, and
plentifully preached. And vouchsafe
to increase the number of the
laborers in this worke, who may
faithfully and diligently worke
therein. That through the same,
thy people, which now sit in darknes,
may be enlightened, that such
as are farre off may come neere:
and they that are without, at thy
good pleasure may be brought into
this kingdome:

and therby so direct our liues▪ that
we in all vertuousnes & godlines
of conuersation, may finish our
course vpon earth: And afterward
liue with thy Sonne in eternall
blisse. And seeing thy kingdome is
not meat and drink, neither consisteth
in ceremonies and traditions
deuised by man; neither commeth
it with obseruations, neither is it in
word, but in righteousnesse, and
peace, and ioy in the holy Ghost,
and in power: Graunt that wee
all may bee truely regenerate and
borne new by the holy spirite, and
may no longer spend the dayes of
our liues in the lusts of the flesh,
in the vanities of the mind, and in
pride of life. But may eleuate
and raise vpwarde all our affections,
euen vnto thy holy hill, from
whence commeth the life wherein



we liue, the helpe whereby wee
stand, and the power wherby we
are defended. And be thou present
good Father, in al readines to support
vs being weak, to releeue vs
being poore, and to traine vs vp
in all heauenly knowledge, being
altogether ignorant.
            And let euerie of thy children
that thirst after that righteousnes,
bee filled with all good thinges
within and without, that wee may
goe forwarde in dayly exercise of
pietie and godlines, in knowledge,
in faith, in loue, in hope, and in
true zeale, that we may liue within
the compasse of thy fatherly
protection, die in thy loue, and bee
in the end crowned with the glorious
merites of thy Sonne in
heauen. Amen.

               OH Father mercifull, &
euerlasting, be mercifull
vnto vs, and giue
vnto vs a feeling of
thy blessed will, open
vnto vs the waye of true knowledge,
prepare our steppes, to walke
a right, that in all the course of
our liues, we may be guided aright
and sauour more of heauenly then
of earthly thinges: And let our
whole delight be to meditate righteousnesse:
Let vs imbrace equitie,
and execute iustice, let vs abounde
in loue, mercie, sanctitie, and true



holines, & furnish vs largely with
al spiritual graces, wherby we may
continually seeke thine euerlasting
kingdome, and practise the righteousnesse
thereof for euermore: illuminate
our vnderstandinges by
thy spirit, and let thy word be our
whole comfort, and the vse thereof
our continuall delight. And abandon
from our thoughts, all superfluous
cares of worldly thinges,
that we may shew our selues: by
a continuall holye meditation of
thee and things aboue, may vse the
thinges of this life, as if we vsed
them not, knowing this and assuring
our selues by thy promises,
that if we seeke and couet to haue
our conuersation, on things spirituall,
all carnall thinges expedient
shall be giuen vs by thee, to whom
be praise for euer. Amen.

            A short Prayer for Mortification.
            OH Lord▪ mightie and mercifull,
who didst create man
in the beginning simple, sincere,
pure and without sinne, in



which is innocencie, he then represented
thine owne image, who art
pure and without spot of sinne,
yet such was man that he fel from
thee, by disobedience, whereby hee
corrupted his waies, and became
farre vnlike vnto thee, defiled with
all vanities, wherein alas, we all
of vs wallow the most with greedinesse
and all in ouermuch neglect
of our duties, wherefore most
deare f
                  •
               ther in Jesus Christ, create
in vs new thoughts new affections,
and new wils, shape in
vs true obedience that we all may
mortifie and kill all sinne, and
vaine inclinations, which in vs
rise vp against thee. Let sinne no
longer heare rule in vs: But let
thy grace more and more abounde,
that all that wee doe thinke or
speake, may be sauouring of our
godly desires of heauen and heauenly
things. And let all earthly
and carnall delightes become of
no price in our heartes, that so
we may bee approued not onely
before men, to bee as wee ought
but to thee to be as thou requirest



in Christ Jesus our Lord.

            A most necessarie Motion
to a Prayer tending to the
comforte and preseruation of
the Church of Christ,
worthy to bee dulye

dayes.
            
               THere is none so
ignorant (I
trust) but well
knoweth, and
is fully satisfied,
that our
good God by
the operation of
the Spirite, through the preaching
of his woorde, hath gathered
together a greate multitude
of people out of all partes of the
worlde, whome hee hath endued
with the knowledge of himselfe,



and whom he hath chosen sincerely
to serue him to call on his holy
name, and to celebrate his praises
in this worlde:How the whole, strength is knit together thogh the members bee scattered. which companie
of people, though farre and neere
scattered, hee hath so vnited and
knit together in one faith, in one
baptisme, and in one sincere course
of doctrine, taught and left vnto
vs by Christ our sauiour. That
he our sauiour disdaineth not to
call them his Church in whome
hee will bee serued, and in whose
hearts and soules hee vouchsafeth
to dwell▪ euen by his holy spirite,
hee disdaineth not to accept this
Church as his spouse and wife, affording
himselfe to be her husband:
he is the head,Ephe. 5. 22. and this faithfull
companie the mēbers.2. Cor. 11. 2 
               This church

is of this fellowshippe and
companie,1. Cor. 1, 2. & is trulie ioyned vnto
that head Christ Jesus,Euery member of the Church is ioyned vnto Christ. is so seperated
from the wicked, that he liueth
in Christ, and Christ in him.
            And forasmuch as we al know
that Christ our sauiour, when he



came in the flesh: and beeing present
in the world,Mat. 28. 18. though he were
Lord of all,Col. 2. 10. became as a seruant,
humbling himselfe, and was of no
reputation among men: but was
scorned, derided, whipped, spit at,
and in most base manner abused,
and at last hee was crucified: yet
was hee pure, innocent, stedfast,
patient, faithfull, and did loue his
enemies, and prayed for them. All
this he did and suffered, to the end
that his Church and euerie member
thereof, should learne of this
their head, and be guided by this
their husband, how and in what
course to carrie themselues in this
present world.
            And for that man of himselfe is
ignorant and weake,The spir

               he hath left
his owne example for his children
to follow, and his spirit to guide
this his Church, that it steppe not
aside, to an vnknowne husband:
But that in all obedience, they
shoulde performe what hee commandeth,
The true Church is the image of Christ. and carefully auoid what
he forbiddeth.
            Christ beeing now ascended, and
sitting in the heauens at the right



hand of his father, hath left this
his Church as his image, heere in
earth to be scorned, scoffed, whipped,
afflicted, persecuted, & euē massacred,
murthered and spoyled, by
the enemies of his crosse, And euerie
member of this Church must
lay downe his account before
hand, and reckon what it will cost
him, and he shall finde that it will
amount vnto no lesse, than persecution,
trouble, enemies, and euen
death it self,The church must suffer persecutiō. if he wil truely follow
his maister Christ. And this portion
is the very badge whereby his
Church, and the true members
therof are known: It is the touch
stone and triall of our professions.
And to the ende that wee may the
more exactly follow him, hee commandeth
vs to forsake our se
                  •
               ues,
and▪ to take vp his crosse, and patientlie
abide and beare whatsoeuer
triall shall be laid on vs by his
enemies, who if they spared not
him being the head, they will not
forbeare the members. If they called
him, euen our maister, Belzabub,
what reproch will they not
giue vs? if they crucified the Lord



of glory, much more will they persecute
his children.
            It appeared, as soone as the
maister was taken away, the seruantes
were despised; when the
shepheard was gone, the sheepe
wandred abroad, and all the children

way to Christ, but by tribulation
            
               The wicked do continually seek
to oppresse such as are true of hart,
they make sharp their swords, they
bend their bowes, and dispose their
arrowes in the stringes,

it hath come to the tast of true religion,
hath tasted how true it is
that is said, that they that will liue
vprightlie, shall haue many that
will rise vp against them. How
hath the rage of Sathan appeared
against vs, with bitter threats frō
               Spaine, with excommunications



and condemnations from Rome?
how haue we bin labored to haue
bene seduced by Priests and Seminaries,
The practises of the enemies of the Church of God. from our bounden loue
and dutie, not onely towards her
Maiestie but towards our God?
if cursings, if blessings, if disswasions,
or perswasions, if threats of
hell, if promises of heauen, if throwing
downe, or exalting high, if
feare of fire and sword could haue
preuailed, we had falne and forsaken
God ere this day: how haue
they sought the death and destruction
of our gratious Queene, and
graue Counsellors, by inchantments,
by magick, by murther, and
by all deuilish practises? Haue we
not bine enuironed by Fleetes of
foes at sea? by armies of rebels by

Traytors at home? hath there ye

hath not God stood our defence?
hath not our Christ, the
head of our Church stood in the
gap against these trecheries and
tumultes? and doeth there not

a Church still driuen to defende it



selfe: and a Church malignant, a
Church fraught with malice against
the truth?A Church militant & a Church malignant, a Church offended,
and a Church offending, a
Church suffering, and a Church
persecuting,? And who doth not
see how manifestly it appeareth▪
that our Church is that Church
which resembleth our head Christ
Jesus in suffering, and the other
to be the Church resembling their
father the Deuill, by massacring
and killing▪ who seeing his kingdome

noting how his Church and the

beginneth to enkindle the coales
of dissention betweene kings and
kingdomes, and stirreth vp traitors
vnder collour of teachers,
murtherers in the name of catholiques,
and deuils vnder the habit
of a religion: by whome the whole
worlde is at this day set all in a
flame, and they labour by all
means, to peruert with the venom
in their tayles, the consciences of
al true Christians, and where they
see they cannot preuaile by the
trueth, they seeke it by tyrannie:



in the place and steede of mercie,
they vse massacres,The badge of the Antichrist an Church. in steed of peace
which the truth imbraceth, they
stirre vp warres, and in steede of
loue (the badge of Christians) they
execute all hatred, euen to bloud.
If we looke into late yeares, wee
shall finde in Fraunce how thousands
of the Church of God haue
bene murthered,The 
                     •
                  roubles in France. some in their
beds, some in the streetes, some in
the temple, some preaching, some
praying, and whosoeuer was noted
to serue god aright, was swallowed
vp in this deuilish furie:
and for that the more they striued
to suppresse the truth, the more seeing
it to preuaile, they by the instigation
of the adulterer of Rome
proceed on to new deuises, sparing
neither old nor yong, great,
nor small, but take all by the
throat euen their Kinges, and
with butcherly hands defile their
pallaces with most cruel murther,
killing euerie innocent, euen such
as can but name the Lord Christ,
and him serue as their onely redeemer
in the lowest measure, doe
they most cruelly cut off with vntimely



death.
            Is it not therfore high time for
the poore Church of God, in regard
of this bloody worke of the
Deuill, to poure foorth continuall
ardent prayers vnto our God for
his present helpe in this trouble?
And howsoeuer we rest in great
measure freed from massacres and
open murthers heere in England,
through the louing hande of our
good God, yet are we not without
continuall occasions,England hath great cause to pray. to moue vs
to godly supplications, that God
in his mercies will cōtinue our fauourable
God for euer, and that
he will be still mindfull of vs, that
wee fall not into our enemies
hands, who (as we see) practise by
all kindes of pollicies to presse in
vpon vs, to deale with vs as they
haue dealt with other nations: nay
to make vs to be no more a people.
            The remembrance of our little
persecution in the time of Queene
Marie,
               The persecution in Queene Maries time, a meane to 
                     〈…〉
                  
                may moue vs to due obedience
vnto our God, who did speedilie
deliuer vs by the gracious
hand of our most sacred Queen Elizabeth
in whome, vnder our good



God, we haue bene this 39 yeares
almost compleat, so happily defended,
that wee haue had free scope
to serue our God in truth: whereas
wee see other nations to bee so
suppressed by the heauie hande of
the wicked man, that none dare
stand vp to professe God, but with
present torture.
            Oh let vs therfore be thankfull
to our mighty God, for his help in
all former dangers, and pray, that
we may shew our selues as wise as
Serpents, & as innocent as doues,
that we may stand sound and vnblameable
in our professions, in
faith strong, in loue vnfayned, and
constantly perseuering in this inuiolable
truth, that the gates of
hell, nor the tyrannie of the euill
man preuaile not against vs, that
the fond and idle furie of that Romish
Idol terrifie vs not, whome
together with his worshippers,
our alsufficient God laugheth to
scorne: who, as we see, and haue
tasted, hath by his prouidence turned
their practises to their owne
perdition, all their plots, snares,
and pittes to catch themselues: is


               
not this maruelous in our eyes?
But the truth is great, and it preuaileth.
            
            It is the Lord that hath doone
this great thing. It is hee that driueth
backe the heauen,
               Psal. 44. 2 
               and that
planteth his church, it is he that destroyeth
the aduersaries, & maketh
his own people to grow,
               Psal. 29. 2 
               it is he that
giueth strength vnto his people, &
blesseth vs with peace. Why then
doe the foolish heathen thus rage,
why do these peeuish people murmure
against the church of Christ
in vaine?Psal. 2. 1 When their hope was
to haue preuailed with their peeuishly
tearmed (inuincible armie)
they stumbled and fell:The enemies, hope commeth to nought the hande
of the iust God was against them
and his mighty hand cast them into
the bottome of the sea, and with
his power he confounded their deuise:
and howsoeuer they seeme
to continue malicious, and in a
deepe desire to cut vs off, and to
dispeople vs, let vs not feare, but
duely call vpon the name of God,
our head and husbande, and hee
will breake their bowes, hee will
shiuer their speares in sunder, their



owne swordes shall pearce themselues,
and their owne bullets shal
rent themselues in peeces.
            Let vs therefore continually fal
downe before him in prayer,If God will that we suffer, let vs glorifie him therein. and
in due obedience vnto his worde,
submit our selues vnto his will,
and if hee will that wee suffer for
his name and truethes sake, let vs
glorifie him in our sufferinges,
knowing this, that a crowne of
life is laide vp in store for as many
as take his yoke with patience,
and faithfully endure vnto the
ende.
            
               If it please him, hee can make
warres to cease from one ende of
the world to the other: but if it be
his pleasure to raise vp new euils
against vs for our sinnes, let vs
acknowledge his iudgementes to
be iust, and our deserts to be vile.
And let vs serue him continually,
without feare of them that can
but kill the body, and can not annoy
the soule, then shall nothing
seperate vs from this our Christ,Nothing must seperate vs frō Christ.
nor from the vnity of his Church,
neither tribulation, nor anguish,
nor persecution, nor famine, nor



nakednesse, nor peril of the sword,
nor death, nor life, nor Angels, nor
principalities, nor powers, nor
things present, nor things to come
nor height, nor depth, nor any creature,
neither Pope, Spaniard,
Turke, nor Infidell, nothing
shall seperate vs from the loue of
God, which is in Christ Jesus
our Lord.
            Let euerie member then of this
true Church, with all power and
diligence, endeuour to approoue
himselfe, by knowledge, by faith,
by praier, by humilitie, and patient
abiding the Lordes leasure in
all thinges: so will our louing
God keepe vs vnder the shadowe
of his winges, and preserue vs
as the apple of his eye, that wee
may grow vp, & bring forth fruite
a thousand fold, to the glorie of
his name: and whether by life or
by death, he hath decreed to glorifie
vs, let vs take either in all godlie
obedience vnto his will, and
present our continuall praiers vnto
his Maiestie, for the comfort
and preseruation of the vniuersall
Church.
         
         
            
            The Praier for the church
of God, to bee saide at all
times, and especially in
daungers.
            
               O Almightie God and
euerliuing Father,
who hast vouchsafed
to gather vnto
thy self an holy companie
out of all nations of the
world, whom thou hast most gloriously
entituled with the names
of thy Church, thy spouse, and thy
members, and whome also thou
teachest, louest, and feedest: whome
also thou so tenderly considerest,
that howsoeuer the wicked, euen
thine enemies, doe seeke to annoy
it, thou so defendest, gardest & blessest
it, that no haire of the head or
the least member thereof falleth,
much lesse any one of that cōpanie
perisheth, or is troden down, without
thy prouidence. Yet▪ good father,
such is thy pleasure, that
while this companie shall dwell in
earthly vessels, it is as a ship tossed



and tumbled with the cruel storms
and dangerous waues of the sea,
of continuall persecutions subiect
to often assaults of the enemie, dashed
sometime against the sword,
sometime beaten with slaunders,
backbitings, reproches, & somtime
to beatings, buffettings, crossings:
and sometime to massacres, murthers,
and most cruell death. It is
neuer free from perill, it is alwaies
and by all meanes tryed. There is
no comfort, no ioy, no rest, as long
as it is in this life, but in hope,
wayting patiently the comfortes
and consolations in heauen.
            It continually depainteth out
the sufferings, the crosses, and ignominious
course which Christ
himselfe was forced to suffer here
in earth In so much as it is made
knowne to be thy Church, by the
continuall calamities which here
in this life it endureth.
            Good father, thou seest how the
heathen do rage, and how the froward
people of the earth do murmure
against thee in these thy
members: how the Kinges of the
earth band themselues, & the princes



assemble and consult together
against thee, thy Christ, and against
his Church. But make thy people
strong in faith, that we may breake
their bands, and cast their cordes
from vs: For saluation belongeth
vnto thee; and thy blessing is vpon
thy people. Thou seest, O Lord,
thou seest how the wicked bende
their bowes, and make ready their
arrowes, that they may secretely
shoote at thy children, and to hit
them that feare not. But thou righteous
Lord, louest righteousnes, thy
countenance doth behold the iust,
and thine hand shal hold them vp.
Withdraw not therfore thy tender
mercies from thy Church: let thy
mercie and thy trueth alway preserue
it: for thou seest that innumerable
trobles are raised against
it, but send thou thy light and thy
truth, and let knowledge, faith and
true obedience in lowlines & zeale,
lead it: and by thy mightie hande
preserue it in thy holy mountaine,
and let it alwaies rest in thy tabernacles:
furnish it with all ioye
and gladnes, & gird it about with
strēgth. Let it through thee be able



to thrust back her aduersaries and
in thy name, tread downe such as
rise vp against her. Let thy church
continually sing, The Lord is my
light & my saluation, whom shall
I feare? the Lord is the strength of
my life, of whom shal I be afraid?
In the time of trouble and daunger,
hide thy people in thy tabernacle
in the secret place of thy pauilion:
hide them, O Lord, and set
them vpon a sure rocke, that when
the wicked, euen their enemies and
their foes come vpon them to deuoure
them, let them stumble and
fal. Be thou our strength & shield,
Thou giuest strength to thy people,
and blessest them with peace.
But, good Father, thou seest that
the wicked furiously rage, and endeuour
to rush in vpon thy sanctuarie,
they imagine mischief against
thy church, and seeke by all meanes
to deuour thine inheritance. They
lay snares, O Lord to entrap thy
spouse, & to dismember thy Christ.
They take wicked counsaile, and
in deceit doe they worke all their
diuises: they 
                  ••
               y wait for the righteous
companie, and seeke to destroye



them. But they shall not be
destroid in the perillous time. For
thou, Lord, hast promised to stand
in the defence of thine owne people:
Thou hast saued vs from our
aduersaries; and hast put them to
confusion that hate thy people.
            Up Lord, and beholde, how yet
the enemie seeketh to destroye vs:
O hide not thy face, forget not our
miserie and affliction: thou God,
art the king of all the earth, thou
raignest and rulest ouer the heathen:
therefore will we not feare.
The Lorde of hostes is with vs▪
the God of Jacob is our refuge,
yea, this God is our God for euer
and euer: hee is the guide of his
Church, and he it is that wil come
and will not keepe silence, a fire
shall deuoure before thee, so that
thine enemies shall not bee able to
stand in thy presence, they shall be
scattered abroad & come to shame
suddainely. Thou God hast giuen a
banner to them that feare thee, that
it may bee displaide in testimonie
of thy truth. That thy beloued, euen
thy spouse, may bee deliuered:

                  •
                that euery member of thy church



may dwell in thy tabernacle for euer,
and may rest vnder the couering
of thy wings, when the wicked
shal fal and be vtterly discomforted.
Oh 
                     •
                  ow terrible art thou in
thy works? through the greatnesse
of thy power shall thine enemies
bee subiect vnto thee. And although
thou sufferedst the wicked
to ride euen ouer our heades, although
we haue bin forced to passe
through fire and water: yet hast
thou deliuered vs, and brought vs
into a wealthie place, where thy
word and Gospell, euen the truth
of our saluation, is freely deliuered.
Wherefore, O God, arise, let
thine enemies bee scattered: Let
them that hate thee, flie before thee,
as the smoke vanisheth, so let thine
enemies be driuen backe: let them
not come neere thy sanctuarie. As
waxe melteth before the fire, so let
the enemies of thy Church perish
at thy presence, and let thy people
be glad: let thy congregations sing
and reioyce, let thy beloued leape
for ioy. O send downe thy gracious
raine vpon thine inheritance,
refresh the weary members of thy



Church, such as haue felt the woe
of thine enemies: Let them bee recomforted:
Let the solitarie poore
man that thirsteth for thy sauing
health, be filled with the hid treasures
of thy loue. Deliuer the unprisoned,
and let the children now
in captiuitie, be set free. Wound the
heads of the obstinate and stiffenecked
aduersaries of thy church,
and bruse the hairye scalps of such
as seeke to destroy thy people. Destroy
the companie of the spearemen,
& the multitude of the proud▪
whose hearts are lifted vp against
thy people. Scatter those idle and
euill affected ones, whose delight
is in warre: so shall all kingdomes
of the earth seeke thee, and the nations
dispersed, shall attend vnto
thy voice, & all such as know thee,
shall sing foorth thy praises, yea,
they shal sing vnto him that rideth
vpon the high heauens, & ascribe
al power vnto thee, our great God,
our mighty king, our husband and
head. O God of hostes, cause thy
face to shine vpon vs, and we shall
be saued.
            O Lord increase our faith.
         
         
            
            A Praise of Gods fauour
in protecting his Church, comfortable
to the faithfull.
            Sing faithfully vnto God our
strength: sing aloud vnto the God
of Iacob. Psal. 81. 1.
            
               OVr God is good, why shuld we thē
               
               so long neglect his praise?
               His help doth passe the helpe of mē
               
               whose lawes and loue decaies.
               But lo, the loue of God endures.
               from day to day it stands:
               His spouse to loue & liue he lures,
               and breaks her cruel bands.
            
            
               He sends his word, and giues her light,
               his gospell feedes his flocke,
               His people onely take their flight,
               to him their liuely rocke.
               On him they stay, on him they stād band,
               and he extends his aid:
               He breaks with truth the dolefull
               whereat his Church dismaid.
            
            
               No pompous Pope, no Spaniard proud,
               no direfull drum of foe:
               
                  
No shaft, no shot, no rainles cloude
               can daunt his spouse with wo:
               What though the peeuish mā of sin
               his bloudy badge display.
               What if he vainly vaunt to win?
               be still: he shall decay:
            
            
               The proudest of our foes shall fall,
               their stoutest strength shall rue;
               The stately strumpet fraught with gall,
               shall faint, and all her crue.
               Iehouah yet, his Church shall saue,
               and with his hand defend:
               Who then will rest a popish slaue?
               and not our Englands frend.
            
            
               Breath out thy word, O God our guide,
               let it be publisht so:
               That it may stand and still abide,
               and teach thy Church to grow.
               Let truth preuaile, let faith abound
               let all reforme their waies:
               Our Queen preserue, her foes confound,
               send peace in al her daies.
            
         
         
            
            A Prayer for the Church
of Christ.
            
               MOst gracious God
and louing Father,
in Jesus Christ, look
in fauour vppon the
estate of thy Church
generally dispersed through the
whole world, and whome by the
mal
                  •
               ice of Sathan and tyrannie
of Antichrist, thou seest continually
assayled, with many dangers:
Be thou therefore a castle and defence,
a buckler and rocke, strong
and forceable to withstand the furie
and force of all aduersaries, &
for the better comfort endue it continually
with faith vnfayned,
wherein it, and euerie member
thereof, may safely runne and repayre
vnder the shadowe of thy
winges, whensoeuer perill appeareth.
Graciously guide and gouerne
it, be present with it, and
take the defence thereof into thine
owne hands, to whome it specially
and alone belongeth, and let



it hold on the true course of professing
and practising thy true Religion,
that the aduersaries maye
haue no cause to condemne it
through sinne, which howsoeuer
it may seeme to dwell in the most
godly, while wee liue here: yet let
vs alwaies haue an eye and diligent
watch ouer our thoughtes,
words and actions, that our light
may shine to thy glorie, our good,
and example of other, in peace and
warre, in comfort and calamitie,
and not bee dismaid at the noyes
and report of the greatest daunger.
Amen.
            
            O Lord increase our faith.
         
         
            ¶A motion to a Prayer,
wherein the soule must arme it
selfe against daungers of the
time, in regarde of
false doctrine.
            
               CHrist forseeing in the
daies of his flesh, that
after his departure,
his Children shoulde



be in danger to be seduced from
his sincere truth, by the ministers
of Sathan, false Prophets, and
lying teachers: hath very graciously
giuen vs a forewarning to
take heede of such as enter in amongst
vs in sheeps clothing, who
are inwardly rauening wolues:
Mat. 7. 15. who should priuilie bring in damnable
heresies, euen denying the
Lord, who hath brought them, and
who bring vpon themselues swift
damnation: yet many shall follow
their destructions, by whome the
way of truth is euill spoken of, It
was prophecied long agoe, that in
the latter dayes (euen in the dayes
wherein wee liue) should rise vp
very dangerous doctrines:2. Pet 2. 1. 2. & Sathan
should transforme himselfe into
an Angell of light:Sathan and his ministers, chāge them selues into angels of ligh

                  . and false Apostles,
hauing put on the person
(as it were) of Christ himselfe and
of his Apostles, should creep into
the hearts of Gods children, and
so enchant them with their counterfet
holines, that many through
their hypocrisie should be deceiued:
Many such haue in our dayes risen
vs, and haue caried great shew



of being of the flocke of Christ, but
by their actions haue shewed them
selues verie deuourers of the sheep
of Christ,There are many kind
                     •
                   of deceiuers and haue sought to suck
the bloud of his saints: of which
kind of deceiuers, there are manie
kindes (and they most subtile and
wilie in their generation) & therefore
it behooueth the children of
God, to be carefull, watchfull, and
obedient vnto the wil and word of
God, which is the line wherby we
must direct our course, to sayle aright
vnto the harbour of the heauenlie
truth. Wee must touch the
compasse of our heartes with the
loadstone of truth, wherby we shal
be able to eleuate all our affections
vnto the heauenly day star Christ
Jesus, that no counterfet stone of
mans deceitful opinions, shal draw
vs from the course vnto our heauenly

God, wher we shall enioy our true
and heauenly hearts ease, euen in
this life.
            Let vs therefore pray, that we
be not miscarried by the deceits of
the wicked pilot sathan, whose directions
are meerely indirect, and



whole sailes are deecitfull,Sathans barke a deceitfull and a secure 
                     •
                  radle being
glorious to the eye: and the barke
wherein he carrieth his vnhappie
passengers, seemeth to be a most secure
cradle, gliding on without
tempest or waue, vntill it come to
the end of their race, where alas
they fall into the gulfe of perpetuall
perdition: such a maister is he,
and such mariners are his false
Prophets▪ that they delight flesh
and bloud, and all their course seemeth
sweete, but short: and soure
merchandize shall they haue, that
passe in the pinnise of his poisoned
errours.
            Let vs therefore be watchful, and
flie his painted poyson: for wee
may be soone miscarried, if we enter
but one step into this course. Let
vs cal to mind that Paul hath forewarned
vs of a very perillous
gulf,Act. 20. 29. 30. wherin without great watchfullnes
and praier, we may easilie
fall, and that is; into peruerse opinions,
drawn thereinto by such as
should enter in euen amongst our
selues, yea, of our selues, euē of the
fellow teachers in our congregations,
that should speake peruerse



things, yea, and draw disciples after
them: The strength of whose
inchantments we haue seene, euen
in our owne Church of England,
whose peruerse doctrines might be
recited, but more fitlie omitted: the
spirite speaketh euidently, that in
the latter tunes some shall depart
from the faith, and shall giue heede
vnto spirits of error, and doctrines
of deuels which speak lies through
hipocrisie,1. Tim.

                  . and haue their consciences
burned with an hot iron.
            Let vs harken vnto the worde
of the Lord, & unbrace it: Therfore
let vs couet in all obedience and
meekenes to be taught the trueth▪
pray for vnderstanding and fulfilling
of the same, that we may bee
able to discern these false prophets,
& dreamers of dreames, of whome
Moses also forewarned the children
of Israel,

vnto the idle fantasies of men

that teach those things that they

owne brains,Ier. 2

not learned out of the word of the
Lord, and yet say, The Lord hath
said it, being puffed vp and yet
know nothing but doting about
questions and strife of wordes,
whereof commeth enuie, strife,
raylings,1. Tim. 6. 4. euill surmisings, &c. And
yet feare not nor blush to make
the Lord of heauen the authour of
their lies and vanities:The impudencie of false prophets. who beeing
enemies of God, very traytors
against his crowne, kingdom, and
dignitie, sticke not to collour their
deuilish practises, peeuish opinions,
and grosse errours, with the
worde of God, when indeede the
worde of God bewrayeth them,
confuteth them, and confoundeth
them.2. Cor. 12. 13. 14. 15. Are not these false apostles
deceitfull workers (saith Paule,)
transforming them selues into the
Ministers of Christ, and into his
Apostles.
            Such a strong deceiuer arose of
late euen yesterday,Hacket a counterfeit Christ. that hideous
Hacket, stirred vp by Sathan,
who was trāsformed into no lesse
in arrogation of title, then into
Christ himself hauing on a kinde
of habite of holinesse, his heart



fraught with a 
                  •
               egion of Deuilles,
who poured out mightie blasphemies
against God, high treasons
against her innocent Maiestie, and
most detestable practises against
his countrie. And yet a Christ:
nay, a cursed caitife, in whom was
performed the saying of Christ our
Sauiour, that there should arise
false Christes, that should showe
such strength of errour,It is dangerous to dispute with false prophets that if it
were possible, the very elect should
be seduced by them. And surely it
is dangerous for the weaker sort
to touch them in discourses, in disputations,
or any cōference, vnles
it please god to arme them strongly
with the sword of the spirit, that
by the sword of truth they may bee
enabled to confound them in their
argumentes, for the very true
Christians may often fall through
frailtie,Christians through frailty may fall into errours. in some conceit of thinges
euill to be good, and good things to
be euill: and speciallie when it shall
carrie collour of Godlynesse to
conceiue it so. And manie times
it falleth out that euill things
carry collour to preach vnto vs
good, as in the adherents of this



wicked man, the two Gentlemen
that were deceiued by him, and
drawne to enter into an vnlawfull
action: that that action carried
collour of loue, in that they preached
repentance vnto their countrie:
it carried collour of Religion,
in that they preached as Messengers
sent from God: But see
howe all these gay showes were
mingled with mischeifes,Whereunto a counterfeit show of godlinesse may tend. tending
to stirre vp vprores and tumults
among the people, and to raise an
euill opinion and disloyaltie in the
subiectes towards her Maiesty: &
moreouer, it tended to enuie and
wicked zeale, to bring Magistrats
into contempt. All which preach
vnto vs that it is time for al estats
to looke about them, to be watchfull,
and to be ready to stand in the
day of trial: for these are persecutions
raised against the highest, euen
by such as are with vs in
some outward shewes, but not of
vs as the issue of their workes declare:
but in my poore opinion, this
their preaching publisheth vnto
vs gods displeasure, for ouermuch
security. If they being false Prophets



preach vnto vs repentance:It is time for Gods Ministers to preach repentance & amendmēt of lif
                     •
                  
               
it is time for the true Ministers of
God to crie out for repentance: for
God many waies preacheth vnto
vs repentance and amendment of
life. And because the deuill to an
euill purpose preacheth that which
may admonish vs, let vs vse the
meanes to learne howe to amende
what is to be amended: so shall we
tread him and his purposes vnder
our feete, and God himselfe will
send preachers to publish his pleasure,
and to declare his truth with
warrāt of his word, whose exhortations
shall not be by deceit, nor
by vncleannes, nor by guile, but as
they were allowed of God, and to
whom the Gospell being committed:
they shall speake, not as they
that please men, but God, which
shall approue their heartes. By
whose doctrine also we shall bee able
to find out all the false Prophets
that endeuour to miscarry
vs. The aptest mean to bring men
into the captiuity of errours,Ignorance the mother of errours. and
erronious teachers, is ignorance
of the word, which would God it
were meerly banished the Church



of God that through knowledge
we might wade in the true worde,
and by the same distinguish and

                  •
               ull out the poyson of all peruerse
teachers, and cast it in the fire of
vtter obliuion. That the hearts of
true Christians might be comforted,
& all the congregation of God
knit together in loue. And that all
the ministers of God might proceed
in one rule,Col. 2, 2. and might al mind
one thing in the lord, that nothing
be done of contention or vain glorie,
but that in meeknesse of minde
euerie man esteeme other better
than himselfe.Phil. 3. 16 What mooued these
two Gentlemen, Ardington and
Coppinger, to run that course, but
vaine glorie and ignorance of the
word, without the knowledge
whereof, the intricate and hidden
subtiltie of that wicked monster
Hacket, could not be descried, who
bewitched them with forgetfulnes
of their duties to God, & their
most gracious Queene: for that
they searched not the counsell of
God, neither builded their proceeding
vpon his word: but pricked
on by the fling of singularitie and



vaine glorie, brake out into desperate
and irreligious terms, laying
open, as it were, before all the
world, their own corruptions, and
the deuilish affections of that wicked
man,The end of Hacket that counterfeit Christ▪
                that counterfeit Christ,
that forged king, who was deseruedly
crowned with a halter in
Cheap, according to the words of
Paule,
               2. Cor. 1
                     •
                  . 15. 
               that the ende of these men
shall be according to their works.
            
            It is time for the Children of
God to take warning and bee
watchfull, considering these daungerous
times, wherin swarmes of
falfe prophets do euerie where fly
to and fro to disquiet the godly, as
papists, Brownists, Anabaptists,
the Familie of lust and leudnesse,
termed the family of loue: & many
other dangerous sects,2. Tim. 2. 1
                     •
                  
                who seeke
to quench the ardent zeale of sincere
Christianitie, striuing about
words which is to no profit, but to
the peruerting of the hearers. But
let vs pray that our Ministry may
shew it selfe approued vnto God,
and that our Ministers neede not
to be ashamed, but may diuide the
word of trueth aright, that they



may stay prophane and vaine bablings
which increase to more vngodlines:
2. Tim, 2. 25 16. And that they may keepe
the pattern of the wholsome word
which they haue learned in faith, &
which they may teach in loue in
Christ Jesus. For such is the subtilty
of this wicked workmaster,
who hath sent foorth these hellish
haruest-men, that some one of these
his subtil sectes in showe, meeteth,
& as it were, matcheth euery godly
endeuour and sincere course that
the children of God doe practise in
deed,2. Tim. 6. 25 only to unpaire the credit of a
right Christian life in Gods sincere
children, by the opposition of
science, falsly so called.
            We know that it is the duty of
euery childe of God, to 
                  •
               oe good
workes to approoue his faith, by
which faith he is iustified. And we
see that the deuill hath stirred vp
a doctrine of workes that by them
men are iustified, and therfore such
as stand vpon their own iustification,
carry themselues in shew answerable
in mortall sincerity to the
most godly: when yet they hang in
the Spiders web of sinne, because



they imagine that God wil thanke
them because they doe that which
he hath commaunded them. And
yet by the mouth of God himselfe
they are condemned for vnprofitable
seruants.Luk. 17. 9. 10.
            
            We know that true Christians
do thirst after the word, and desire
to be fedde with the foode of the
Gospel. And therefore desire to repaire
vnto sermons, and to be studious
in the word. And wee may
see how the Deuill prouideth to
blemish this Christian vertue,The Deuill endeuoureth to blemish euerie sincere exercise. by
stirring vp euen of his wicked ministers
to perform the same, as did
the southsayers of Pharao, and at
length to breake out into grosse
and most palpable euils to the end
that the fal of them that stoode not,
should blemish the zeale of right
godly affected.
            Againe, we know that it is the
dutie of Christians to shun swearing,
and blasphemie, to giue continuall
thanks for Gods benefites,
to instruct their families, and to
pray for, and with them. And wee
see that the deuill hauing emulation
hereat, endeuoureth either to



draw such as exercise this sincere
course of life into some action to
discredite their profession, or else
stirreth vp some counterfeit of his
in some shew, to performe this integritie,
that at the last by some
notable fall,2. The. 2. 15. he may bring all other
sincere professors into ignominie.
Therefore, brethren stand fast, and
keepe the instructions which yee
haue bene taught either by words
or by the examples of the apostles.The Deuill practiseth to blemish to preachers of the word.
For aboue the rest of his daungerous
practises, marke how hee endeuoureth
to blemish the profession
of the Gospel, euen in the Ministerie,
& in the sound preachers
of the word, by drawing them into
some grosse euill or other, to the
end that he may bring all the godly
and zealous workemen of the
Lord into contempt, blinding the
eyes of the world, and therby raiseth
a false opinion of the verie sacred
truth.
            By this we see, that euen now
is come the time of triall, and now
it wil be found out who are Gods
children in shew, and who in deed,
it will appeare, who will continue



vnto the end: for if wee giue consent
to strange doctrine, to newe
deuises, to false and counterfeite
waies, whereunto wee are dayly
mooued, then shall wee bee vagabonds
from the Church of God,
howsoeuer we seeme to dwell in
the same, and to be members of it
in outward shew, then wil God in
the last day say, I know you not,
               
howsoeuer we say we haue prophecied
and preached in his name.
            Oh let vs therefore pray, that
we may hold on a true course, and
keepe the line of the truth, without
going to the right or left hand,What the true professors must looke for.
howsoeuer subiect wee shall then
be to slaunders, to scoffes, to reproches,
to imprisonmentes, and
sometime to death it selfe.
            Happie are wee that haue the
booke of life laide open before vs,
wherein is contained the way to
Gods kingdome, and whereby we
may take the path to our heauenly
hearts case,A consideration of the controuersies in our owne Church. and that without reproofe,
whereof we may reioyce.
            And for a farther cause to moue
vs to go vnto god in praier, let vs
somewhat consider the controuersies



which of late haue risen by the
work and instigation of the deuill,
euen in our own Church, amongst
our own guides in our own natiue
land: how it hath raised a scruple
and doubt in some that are not altogether
grounded in the knowledge
of the word, Whether they
should obey the Maiestrate in Ecclesiasticall
causes. And, whether
there should be a superiority or equalitie
in the Church gouernors.
These, and many other cauils hath
hee raised, to hinder the preaching
of the Gospell, which is greatly to
be lamented, and an establishment
of concord amongst our selues to
be sought and hartily prayed for.
The word warranteth our obedience
vnto Magistrats, & therfore,
woe be vnto him that wil teach vs
contrarie doctrine. Let vs indeuor
to performe our duties, and giue
vnto God that which is Gods, &
vnto Caesar that which belongeth
vnto Caesar. And for the controuersie
of the inequalitie of Church
gouernours, it is to bee considered
that there are seuerall functions in
the Church, and euerie function



hath his seuerall person and place,
let vs therfore pray that euery person
may measure his calling by the
word, and limit his superiority or
inferiority, as they are therein directed,
then shall not the people of
God want their due food in regard
of humane contentions. Oh that
euery one woulde enter into his
owne conscience, and as much as
in him lieth, cast away all carnall
consideration, and what the word
of God warranteth, let him holde,
and giue no grounde to the cauillers,
and shun the contrary.
            And for vs that are the common
people, that must expect to
be fed by the ministery, let vs pray
for their vnitie, and that God will
giue them humble spirits, vigilant
and watchfull eyes, knowledge,
loue, zeale, and constancie, that the
false prophets may be abandoned,
and the true ministers of God bee
esteemed and imbraced as the Ministers
of God, Let vs obey them
that haue the ouersight of vs,Heb. 13. 17 and
submit our selues, for they watch
ouer oursoules, as they that must
giue accounts, that they may do it



with ioy, and not with griefe, for
that is vnprofitable for vs, knowing
that false prophets are the enemies
to the crosse of Christ,
               Phil. 3. 18. 19. 
               whose
end is damnation,
               2. Tim 2. 21 
               whose God is
their bellie, & whose glory is their
shame, which mind earthly things.
If any man therfore purge himself
from these, he shal be a vessel of honor,
and sanctified and meet for the
Lord. And therfore let euery man
pray vnto God that they may all
speake one thing, & that there may
be no dissentions amongst vs, but
we may bee knit together in one
mind, and in one iudgment, so shal
the glorie of God appeare, and our
Church prosper.
         
         
            The Prayer against false
Prophets, errors and Schismes,
and for increase of Christianitie.
            
               FOrasmuch, good
Father, as the

                  •
               atter times of the

                  •
               orlde are come
vpon vs, and we



are by thy diuine prouidence, alotted
vnto these dangerous and euil
daies, wherein, as we haue bene
foretold, many false prophets, and
peruerse teachers, dreamers of
dreames, and lying Apostles, are
risen vp: and Sathan that wicked
serpent hath turned himselfe into
an Angell of light, and his Ministers
into the forme of thy Sonne
Christ, and his Apostles, wherby
hee endeuoureth to continue his
kingdome, and to hinder the passage
of thy diuine word, to exalt
errour, & to stop the truth, to confirme
vanitie, and to blemish thy
word. And forasmuch also, good father,
as that man of sin, the son of
perdition, heretofore foretolde to
come, is alreadie come, and hath
established his seate of pride, and
sendeth abroade his lying Ministers
to seduce such as haue not
sufficient taste of thy worde, and
whome thy grace directeth not, to
beware of his wicked practises.
Graunt (oh mercifull God) that
we may through the assistance of
thy diuine spirite, be wise in thee,
and be so guided by thee, that the



deceiuing deuises of these lying
spirits, withdraw not our minds,
hearts and soules, from the true
imbracing of thy sacred worde.
Grant (O Lord) that wee wander
not from the path of thy heauenly
kingdome, but may constantly and
firmely perseuere in thine infallible
trueth vnto the ende, and may
banish all errors and shew of falshoode,
and abide in the vnitie of
thy true Church, and Christian
religion for euer: let no deceitfull
thing miscarrie vs, let not the craft
and subtiltie of Sathan, nor the
hypocriticall habite of holinesse,
(wherewith many of the children
of perdition are clad, to deceiue the
simple and true of heart) preuaile
with vs. Defend vs, good father,
from erroneous sectes, and let vs
not in any sorte ioyne with the
schismes & diuisions of the world:
for (good Father) as they are many,
so are they in many sorts dangerous,
for they all carie shewe of
truth, some mixed with the truth,
and all of them defended for a
truth▪ in so m
                  •
               ch as the trueth it
selfe is little, yea, least of all maintayned,



but suppressed, persecuted,
and vpbrayded, euē with the titles
of error, heresie, falshood, noueltie,
cause of tumults, of rebelliōs, and
contempt of Magistrates, and
such like persecutions: which how
contrarie it is, thou knowest. It
is hard therefore, vnlesse thou
vouchsafe the light of thy holy spirit,
to discerne betweene these, and
as hard to stande without beeing
seduced through their subtilties:
send downe therefore thy grace,
and direct vs in thy truth, and gather
vs together in one sound profession:
enable vs to conceiue aright
the things that belong vnto
saluation, and keepe vs from such
as come into the Church in sheeps
clothing, but are inwardly rauening
wolues, which spare not thy
flocke, but cruelly deuoure thy beloued
sheep, with the poyson of erronious
doctrine: and roote out the
tares, cockle, and darnell of error,
already sowne, from the good seed
of thy word.
            And forasmuch (good father) as
the case standeth so, that who so
will professe thy name, and seeke



to sanctifie the same in a sincere and
right course of life, not bending
his affections, or yeelding liking to
the wicked course of this world, in
whose proceedinges standeth but
the shadow without the substanciall
fruite of sinceritie, cannot
wade through this vale full of
confused corruptions, but he shall
fall into the hands of such as carrie
the titles of Christians, & will
yet seeke Antichristianlie, to impose
themselues against him, with
y• bitternesse of their vpbraydings,
to quaile (if it were possible) and
to discomfite, nay, to seduce euen
the faithfull from the sincere seruice
of thee. And this (deere Father)
is dangerous vnto the weak
and feeble ones, wherefore giue vs
aide and strength, that we slide not
by their slipperie practises from a
constant perseuerance in the inuiolable
truth, but rather may with
all willingnes, not only lay down
our goods, & all naturall respects,
but euen life it selfe, rather than to
shew our selues as broken bowes,
to start aside with euerie blast of
vaine doctrine, and thereby be carried



away into vanitie and errour.
            And according vnto thy promise,
vouchsafe that whensoeuer
any of thy children, for the testimonie
of their faith in thee, and
for their ardent zeale in thy word,
shall be apprehended▪ reprooued, or
exacted before Princes or rulers,
howsoeuer vnlearned or vnable,
they shall be in respect of deepe literature,
or worldly wisedom, thine
holie spirite may enlighten their
vnderstandings, giue knowledge
vnto their heartes, and vtterance
vnto their lips, that they may be
able to speake & defend thy truth,
to the vtter confutation of such
false teachers as shall withstande
the same: & giue them al
                  •
               o knowledge
and boldnesse, that the high
looks, and the thundring threates
of the mightie aduersaries dismay
them not: so shall thy name bee
glorified, thy word magnified, and
thy poore children sing foorth the
praise of thy might and maiestie,
with heauenly wisdome in worldly
foolishnesse, and in the ende bee
crowned with the diademe of eternall



felicitie, with thy Saintes in
blisse. Amen.
            O Lord increase our faith.
         
         
            Against false Prophets,
and deceitful teachers.
            
               O God that guid'st that faithful flock,
               and leadst it by thine hand,
               That gau'st it water of thy rock
               in drie Arabia land.
               Giue grace to vs to flie the men,
               that teach thy word awry;
               Of whō thy son forewarnd vs whē
               
               he did their sleights espie.
            
            
               He did foresee hypocrisie
               should lurk in godly weed,
               And wolues in sheeplike tyre to lie
               and on thy sheepe to feed.
               The subtile serpent shroudes his wiles
               attyrde like Angel bright.
               And false Apostles fraught with guiles.
               do counterfeit the light▪
               
            
            
               The man of sin that sits on hie,

            A motion tending to
praier, that al estates may gouerne
themselues according
to their
duties.
            
               WE often offend all
the sorte of vs in
this point, namely,
in attributing
more vnto our
welth, our worldly
wisedome, our offices, our places



and high titles,Our good liking of our high estates, dangerous. our callings,
and our skill, in whatsoeuer art
or facultie, then indeed we ought:
for by ouer good conceit of any of
these, we imagine that all good
successe commeth of our selues: inso
much, as the wealthy seeme to
be secure, in regard of their aboū
               dance
of all things, and think they
haue need of nothing, and therfore
seldome or neuer flie vnto God for
succour, but seeke it in their chests.
            The politike and wise according
vnto the world, are carelesse
of the counsell of God, of his directions
and assistance, because in
their generations, they are wiser
than the children of light, and so
deepe are they in their owne selfe
iudgement, that it is impossible for
them to bee deceiued. They that
haue high, profitable and honourable
offices, which is in this life
the greatest worldly gift that God
bestoweth vpon man, what auaileth
it if they execute such high
places without the due obseruation
of the sinceritie of conscience,
violated with corruption and violence
towardes inferiours, and



with crueltie towards such as offend
them?A sincere conscience must accompanie a high office or calling. These high callings,
honourable or profitable offices,
wil render vnto the abusers of the
same, the reward of eternall ignominie
in the end.
            The baser sort of men,Too good opinion of our skill in manuall occupations, dangerous. such as
in their arts, faculties, and manuall
occupations, do exceed other in
skill and excellencie, they waxe arrogant,
and eleuate themselues aboue
other, and in their conceites
despise other, yet in the end besot
themselues, and fall into miserable
contempt, euen of the most basest.
            Sith then that these high gifts
often times make vs to forget our
selues and God:Euery m

expedient for euery man in his calling,
to looke into the ende for
which hee was called thereunto,
and to proceede vnto the performance
and execution thereof, according
to the commandement of
God, in truth, in zeale of a good
conscience, and in all humilitie
and meekenesse: knowing this,
that otherwise our callings wil be
crossed, and that in iudgement▪
               Saule was worldly wise and a



mightie king and one that stood
in the place of high honour and
dignitie: Yet because he thought
his wisdome better than in deed
it was, the Lord pulled him down
from his kingly throne, to ignominie
and shame. Iob was welthy
yet hee was brought to extreme
pouerty,Iob. 1. 3. to shew the vncertaine
estate of rich and wealthy men.
Achitophel was wise and politike,
in so much as his counsel was accounted
as the Oracle of God,2, Sam. 16. 23 yet
because it was not seasoned with
the truth, in the feare of God, it
turned to his owne shame,

                  , Sam. 17. 23. and at
last his counsell being contemned,
hee hanged himselfe. The Judges
that accused Susanna falsly, were
men of authority, yet for that they
abused their authoritie, they were
found worthy of death. Demetrius
was a cunning artificer, and vnder
collour of his skill, and by reason
of the gaine which he got by the
same, hee was moued to driue others
of the same mysterie, not hauing
the fear of God, not onely
to forsake religion, but to raise tumult
against Paule. So that wee



see▪ that not one of these excellent
gifts or rare qualities,Our callings them selues can not releeue vs. are of them
selues able to cōfort or releeue vs,
but rather of them selues to draw
vs into diuers euils, yea and breed
in vs greater inconueniences than
if we were destitute of them. And
therefore it behooueth euery one of
vs, to craue the assistance of god, &
the direction of his grace, that we
may guide our professions, and vse
his gifts wisely, reuerētly, & humblie,
knowing that it commeth not
of our selues to performe any good
in what place or calling soeuer we
be, howsoeuer rich, howsoeuer
glorious,No calling without the feare of God prospe

                  eth euer. howsoeuer wise, howsoeuer
cunning we are, without the
feare of God we are yet poore, ignominious,
foolish and ignorant,
and verie sots, and nothing that
we take in hand shall prosper to
the end, howsoeuer it fare with vs
for a time.
            We may not shewe our selues
swine, who seeke their draffe and
acornes, and their whole nouriture
from the earth, neuer looking vp
to the hand that giueth it, nor to
the tree from whence they fall. We



liue not by bread onely, that wee
sowe and reap of the earth: we get
not our wealth by our owne wisedome,
but by the prouidence of
God, by his word, and by his promises
which we apprehend and receiue
by the hande of faith: and
therefore must wee looke vp vnto
the hil, from whence commeth our
help, we must flie vnto the Lorde,
who blesseth our wealth, our
wisedome, our authoritie, our
knowledge, and our occupations:
for he setteth in authority, and pulleth
downe, hee giueth wisedome,
and besotteth it, hee instructeth vs
in artes, sciences, and in our occupations,
and he blesseth and curseth
vs in them, as wee shewe our
selues in dutie obedient vnto him,
so he sheweth himselfe readie willing,
and able to blesse and help
vs.
            It is not ynough to be able in
some measure to discharge our dutie,
in our offices and callinges, but
we must pray that wee may discharge
the same truely, which we
cannot doe without the blessing of
God. Except the Lorde builde the

go to our rest late, and in griefe to
eate our breade,vers. 20 vnlesse the Lorde
giue a blessing vnto our labours
and studies.
            Wherefore let vs repayre vnto
our good God, with humble harts
in faithful supplications: that hee
will giue vs ablenesse to performe
our callings skilfully and religionslie,
that in quiet of conscience
wee may eate the fruites of our labours,
and so prosper in al that we

            The Prayer that euerie
man may liue vprightly
in his calling.
            
               O God of all comfort,
and giuer of all consolation,
forgiue my
sinnes, cleanse mee,
and wash mee from
all iniquitie, which disable mee to
performe my calling, in such sinceritie
as becommeth mee. And
through the bloud of thy Sonne,
purifie my heart, and my imperfections,
increase my knowledge
and sanctifie mine affections with
thy grace, that my sinnes being
forgiuen, I may rest in thy fauor,
and in thy fauour finde continuall
comfort, and be dayly blessed with
new gifts: that I may be founde
perfect in my calling, seasoned so
with a liuely faith in thee that thy
holy spirite may continually dwell
and beare rule in me, and lead mee
to the due performance of those
things which thou requirest to
be done in my calling: that all vnnaturall
affections being truelye



mortified, I may onely rest in thee,
and relie on thee, and be ruled by
thee in all things.
            Good Father, graunt that I
may take the direct & right course
in my vocation to eternall life. In
which course consisteth the inward
peace of the soule, which is
onely delighted in thine inuiolable
truth, reueiled by thy Sonne, and
left vnto vs in his word and last
will. In which his last will and
Testament are comprehended all
necessarie rules, and the sacred discipline,
whereby thy children are
to guide them selues in their seuerall
callings: which directions, are
comprehended in three principall
vertues, by thee bestowed vpon
them that seeke them at thy
hands, in the name of thy sonne,
faith hope and loue: which three
are so vnited and knit in one, that
they dwell altogether in thine elect
children: & so precisely direct them
through thy grace, that they goe
not awry in their callings.
            I therefore (good Father) being
of mine owne wisdom ignorant,
and of mine owne power vnable



to comprehend the height, the
length, and depth of my calling, instantly
beseech thee, in mercy to beholde
mee, an vnperfect creature▪
without these vertues, and so adorne
me with them, that I, may
be made perfect in all good workes
of the spirit, that my bodilie labors
be not in vayne in thee.
            Graunt also, that I may ioyne
with all my trauailles, labors, affections,
desires, and endeuours,
faith with faith, knowledge with
knowledge, temperance with temperance;
patience with patience,
godlines with godlines, brotherly
kindnes, and with brotherly kindnes
loue: that I bee not vnfruitfull
in my calling. But may acknowledge
thy sonne Christ Jesus,
and in him to haue peace of
conscience: that I may bee patient
in troubles, long suffering in
wronge
                  •
               : meeke in trials: faithfull
in expecting helpe in distresse, reioycing
in heart, quieted in minde,
in hope to inioy at thy handes, and
in thy good time, whatsouer maketh
to the true comforte of my
soule, and the reliefe of my bodie.



That in all truth and inward feeling
of thine aide, my calling may
be made perfecte, and sealed with
the seale of thine owne spirituall
approbation. So shall I thine vnworthy
creature, and all such as
thou hast committed to my charge
bee directed in the true knowledge
of thee, and sustayned with
thinges necessary while wee liue
here.
            Oh blessed Lord and louing father,
except thou thus direct me, I
cannot stande, but shall fall into
many miseries. For no estate, no
degree, no calling, office function,
or trade of life, can prosper or bee
rightly performed, without thy
continuall ayde, direction and prouidence.
            Therefore Lord, guide mee by
thy spirite, encrease my faith, giue
mee wisedome and ablenes in all
thinges to execute calling as I
ought: and to the execution thereof,
blesse all my members, make
them apt and ready instrumentes
to perform their duties, that in no
poynt I fayle in a Christian proceeding
therein. And bridle in mee



the nature of flesh & bloud, which
(vnles thou season my affections
by thy spirit) will so much the more
glorie, by howe much thou hast
exalted me to worldly preferment,
& enable mee to liue in this world,
in higher reputation than other
men, whereunto flesh and bloud
is ready to attribute chiefest harts
ease. And by that subtil shift, Sathan
manie times, mooueth vs to
relie vpon vain things. And therfore
(good Father) vouchsafe so to
ground all mine affections vppon
thy feare, that I bee not miscarried
in my calling, from the true obedience
vnto thee, without which
neither honour, profit, friendes,
wealth, wisedome, or any other
blessing of thine, can steede, releeue,
or comfort me.
            Be present therefore, good and
gracious Father, with mee, and
grant that all thinges that I take
in hand, may begin in knowledge,
proceed in feare of thee, and end in
loue, that my whole course of life
may be blessed with good effect, in
all my endeuours. That neither
mine enemies reioyce at my miseries,



the godly bee offended at my
rashnesse, nor my estate hindered
by my foolishnes. Good Lord grant
this for thy sonnes sake. Amen.

in our callings.

And all these,The godly & the wicked are troubled, but in diuers sortes. or some parte of

Dauid,
               Psal. 6. 2. 33 
               Many are the troubles of
the righteous, but the Lord deliuereth
them out of all. He heareth the
poore, and despiseth not his prisoners:
Such as are shut vp in the
afflictions of the world, as was
Dauid, who was persecuted of
Saul, and crossed by his owne son
Absolon:
               Gen. 39. 20. As Ioseph, who was imprisoned
for his sincerity & continencie,
whose hard & euill entreatment
is specified Psal. 105. Ieremy
the holy prophet of god,Ier. 20. 2. was likewise
imprisoned and buffeted, fettered
and euill intreated, for doing

them no comforte, and whose life
seemeth vnto the prosperous a verie
madnes, a very hell, and an ignominious

thus and wolde with them to take

follow Christ. And let them not
feare, though the earth be moued,
and though the mountains fal into
the midst of the sea, though the
waters thereof rage, and be troubled,
and the mountaines shake
at the surges of the same, for there
is a riuer whose streames shal make

it. And thereof giueth hee the thirsty

he away the teares from the
eyes of his afflicted children, and

               the Lord

the rich, and such as are famous in
the world, and who abhorreth the
needie, the base, the poore, and miserable.
But the Lorde loueth and
regardeth, he fauoureth and releeueth
the poore: hee hideth not his
face from him that is in miserie:
but when he calleth vpon him, hee
heareth him, and releeueth him:
And howsoeuer miserably we be

although it fall out with the godly
in this worlde, that when they are
afflicted, the wicked, nay, sometimes
such as carrie great colour
of Christianitie, are ready to persecute
them whome the Lorde visiteth,
and sticke not to ad more sorrow
vnto their griefe, whom the
Lord toucheth with any crosse. It
is no new thing, for experience it
selfe teacheth it, and it is become a
prouerbe, that one mischiefe followeth
another, and all troubles



come together: and to verifie it euery

And surely, if without offence
I may make the comparison, the
men of this world may be likened
to a company of dogges, who will
ioyne all together vpon a poore
curre, that is already ouermatched.
And so do the cruell men, hand in

               O Lord God, my most
louing Father, & creator,
who of thy franke
and free fauour hast
called mee into this
world, and placed me in the same,
when I wādred as a poor pilgrim,
a miserable and distressed wretch
                  •
               
for whome thou heretofore hast
vouchsafed to prouide thinges necessarie
and expedient, and hast also
giuen mee prosperous and gracious
successe in my proceedinges.
But of late, my sinnes haue made
a seperation betweene thy fauour
and my necessitie, in so much as I
now feele thy heauy hand of iudgment,
wherein I am bereaued of
some of thy woonted comfortes, in
somuch as it seemeth that thou settest
thy self, as it were against me:
but alas, what am I earth and ashes,
that thou shouldest contend
with me? let it rather please thee
(good Father) to refresh mee with



the timelie showers and pleasaunt
dewe of thy louing assistance, that
where I am now low, I may bee
exalted to thy protection: being
poore, I may be enabled to liue: being
base, or of little or no credit in
the world. I may be beloued and
imbraced, and comforted of thee:
behold my pouertie, consider mine
affliction, and weigh my miseries:
For innumerable troubles haue
compassed mee, my sinnes haue
taken such holde vpon mee that I
am not able to looke vp. Oh let it
please thee (good Father) to deliuer
me, make hast (O Lord) to releeue
me, though I be poore and needie:
O thinke thou on me, thou art my
helper and my deliuerer, oh make
no long tarrying: O (my God)
why hast thou fergotten me? thou
art the God of my strength, why
hast thou put mee away: vp (my
God) why sleepest thou, awake, be
not farre off for euer, wherefore
hidest thou thy face, and forgettest
my miserie and affliction? my soule
is beaten downe, I haue no ayde,
no comfort, all my consolation is
come to an end, therefore rise vp,



O succour me, rise vp, O my helper,
rise vp, O my castle, rise vp, O
my refuge, rise vp and restore mee
againe, thou God of my comfort,
Thou rocke, and my fortresse, my
strength, my shield, the horne also
of my saluation, and my refuge.
            
            Thou hast promised to be a refuge
for the poore, a refuge in due
time, euen in affliction. I am
poore and in miserie, help me, for
baine is the helpe of man. They
that knowe thy name, will trust
in thee, for thou neuer failest them
that trust in thee. The poore shall
not alwayes be forgotten, the hope
of the afflicted shall not perish for
euer. Thou hast promised to blesse
our victuals, and to satisfie the
poore with breade. Innumerable
are thy mercies, and that my soule
knoweth right well, and I thirst
after thee in a barren & drie land:
I wait thy releefe, in this miserable
time, wherein there is no
comfort: but thou vpholdest them
that fall, thou releeuest all that
are ready to perish, and therefore
doe the eyes of all wayte on thee,
and thou giuest vs all meate

and he heard me, and deliuered me
out of all my troubles.

turne thee towardes me, and haue
mercie vpon me, for vnlesse thou
hold me vp, I shall fall, vnles thou
stay me, I shall bee ouerthrowne,
and vnlesse thou releeue me, I shal
vtterly perish.

loue is sweet, the experience of thy
power recomforteth my soule. It

foode by a rauen, euen so canst

raysing vp the most cruell men of

the Lyons, and thou canst deliuer
vs from the cruell men of the
worlde. It was thou that directedst
the hand of Dauid to kil Goliah,
and thou canst teach our fingers
to fight and withstand them
that rise vp against vs. It was
thou that filledst many thousande
people with a small show of bread
and Fishes, and it is thou that
canst feede thy seruantes that call



vpon thee euen with little in
shew, and canst increase it as thou
wilt. It was thou that diddest
saue thy three childrē in the furnace
from the force of the fire, and thou
canst preserue vs in the fierie triall
of this world. It was thou that
deliueredst Paule and Sylas out of
prison, and thou canst deliuer thy
children out of whatsoeuer captiuitie.
It was thou that didst
worke for Ioseph, that his imprisonment
turned to his promotion,
and thou canst turne al our calamities
to our comfort. It was
thou that raysedst mee from my
mothers breast vnto this estate
wherein I am, and thou canst
preserue me, feede me, and hold me
vp for euer: yea (good God) I, euen
I by experience, can sing of thy
goodnes, yea, the goodnesse of the
Lord endureth for euer, the mercies

haue beene dull of beleefe, nowe
see and consider, that great is the
God of Abraham, of Isaak, and

mightie to saue, his mercies infinite,
his loue woonderfull, his prouidence
past finding out: when sorrow
commeth in the euening, thou
Lord, sendest ioy again in the morning:
when I am in neede, thou
releeuest me, when I am in danger,
thou comfortest mee, when I
am sicke, thou makest my bed, and
curest my disease. When haue I
come vnto thee, and haue bene reiected?
Neuer hath my complaint
bene put back, but louinglie hard,
and my petitions graunted, so
that I reste assured of thy continuall
help. I am forced (good Father)
to seeke thee dayly, and thou
offerest thy selfe dayly to be found,
whensoeuer I seeke, I finde thee,
in my house, in the fieldes, in the
Temple, and in the high waye:
Whatsoeuer I doe thou art with
mee, whether I eate, or drinke,
whether I write, or worke, goe,
or ride, reade, meditate, or pray,



thou art euer with me wheresoeuer
I am, or whatsoeuer I doe, I
feele some measure of thy mercies
and loue. If I be oppressed, thou
defendest me, if I be enuied, thou

feedest me, whatsoeuer I want,
thou giuest me. Oh continue this

               thy mercies seene in deed.
            
            
               N No end therof, ye same remains,
               thy mercies, power and loue,
               Are ready prest to ease my paines
               my help is from aboue.
            
         
         
            
            A motion to a thankesgiuing
in the morning.
            
               IT is a necessary thing
while we liue here,
that wee should bee
continually exercised
in a due contemplation
of Gods mercies towardes
vs,All seasons giue vs occasion to praise God. and there is no time, but necessarilie
administreth vnto vs
great and daylie occasions to celebrate
the name of the Lord.
            If we looke into the day, wherinto
wee enter rising out of our
beddes, a thousand thinges open
themselues vnto the viewe of our
eyes, whose glorie and beautie, put
vs in mind of our farre surpassing
glorie to come, as also of our frailtie,
and ignominie present. For
what are we of our selues,We men of our owne nature far worse than the floures of the field. in regard
of the flowers of the fielde,
whose beautie and hew, may make
vs blush, and indeede to tremble,
in respect of our casuall and short
continuance here, had wee not a
certaine assurance of a more glorious
estate to come: for as we see



the most sweete & fragrant floure
quicklie to fade:A resemblance of the estate of mans life as to grow in the
morning gay, and in the euening
cut downe and withered, and all
other thinges to come speedilie to
their end: euen such is our estate
if we consider the vncertaintie of
our dayes, which would soone
haue an ende, did not the mercies
of the Lord, and his comfortable
hand conduct vs, and holde vs
vp.
            For let vs consider how the
want of our daylie sleepe doth annoy
vs:The benefite of dayly sleepe. who can forbeare sleep one
weeke? nay, for lesse while? What
thing is more tedious and irksome
vnto the bodie,The want of dayly rest grieuous to the body, and the vse thereof the contrary. than the want of
dayly rest? and what comforteth it
more than the daylie vse and enioying
thereof? and what are we,
being possessed with heauines and
drousines of the bodie? and when
we are cast into a dead sleepe, are
we not as dead men?Sleepe maketh vs being aliue, to resemble men dead. whose memorie,
hearing, seeing, and all other
sences are cleane gone? wherein
we are seperated (as it were) from
God and the world, wee can neither
think on God, or good things,



we cannot doe any thing whereby
to defend our selues from the
least danger.
            Let vs therefore this morning
recount the light & great fauour of
our good God towards vs,We should in the morning recount Gods blessings in the night past. wherein
euen this night he hath preserued
vs from many casualties,
whereof there are many kinds, by
theeues and robbers, by fire, by
suddaine sicknes. Yea, death seemeth
to haue a hand fixed on vs,
which might easilie haue dispatched
vs this night, had not God
preuented vs, whose continuall
help is so ready, that euery morning
doth witnesse his loue. Let
vs therfore reuerentlie fall downe,What our dutie is towards God in the morning.
and giue him condigne thankes,
for all his louing kindnes towards
vs: yea, early now this morning,
let vs shew foorth the louing kindnes
of the Lord. Psal. 92. 2.
            
         
         
            
            The Thanksgiuing in
the morning.
            
               O Lord, I will praise
thy name, earlie now
this morning will I
glorifie thee, who by
thy louing protection
hast so garded me, that no euill
hath taken hold of me this night.
            Oh most high, mightie, and fauourable
God, the day is thine,
and the night is thine: thou hast
framed the day for vs to trauaile
in, and the night thou hast appointed
for vs to rest in. I giue thee
most humble & vnfained thankes,
good father, for thine vnspeakeable
mercies, who hast not only giuen
me my comfortable rest this night
past, but also hast kept me, as it
were, vnder the shaddow of thy
wings, euen as the apple of thine
owne eie. And had I not bene defended
by thee, innumerable daungers
had ouertaken mee. If then
hadst not raised mee vp this morning,
I should not haue bene able



to rise, but haue perished in my
bed. O great is thy mercy towards
me, far surpassing my deserts: for
it is thy hand (good Father) that
hath this night preserued me from
perishing. Therfore lift I vp mine
eyes euen to the heauens, from
whence I haue obtained this safetie.
Yea, betimes in the morning
I wil call vpon thee, that thy mercies
may euermore preserue mee,
and ouershaddow me, that no euill
either of soule or bodie hurt mee:
and graunt that thy most sacred
protection may alwayes preuent al
the secrete and open euils which
hang ouer my head.
            Giue me thy spirit of wisedome
and reuelation, this morning, that
I may know thee, and serue thee.
Lighten the eies of mine vnderstanding,
that I may knowe thy
will, and according vnto the same,
frame all mine actions this day:
and graunt also, that I may finde
how excellent thou art in thy power,
how sweete thou art in thy
mercies, and in performing thy
promises, wherin thou continuallie
workest, to the comfort, defence,



and releefe, of all such as come vnto
thee.
            O Lord increase our faith.
         
         
            A motion to an Euening
Prayer.
            
               THe day being now
past, & the light of
ye sun being ouershaddowed
with
darkenes,A godly consideration in the entrance of the euening. let vs
consider, that euen
so there will come the daye
wherein the light of our bodilie
eies shall be shut vp, not for a night
as in the bed through a slumber,The night is ordained for the rest of man.
but vntil the appearance of Christ
in his glorie, comming to iudgement.
            And forasmuch as al things for
the most part,A consideration of our estate in the night, with a godly resolution when we shut vp our eies to rest▪
                at this time betake
them to their rest, & man is limitted
this time to cease from his labours.
It is our duties especially
to betake vs into the gracious
protection of our good God, submitting
vs, our bodies and soules,



to his tuitiō, that if it be his pleasure
to touch vs this night with
the finger of death, we may be so
readilie prepared, that we bee not
taken at vnawares, but that wee
may haue the light of the lamp of
a faithfull expectation of that blessed
houre, burning continuallie in
our hearts, which may awaken vs
out of the deadly slumber of securitie,
whereby otherwise, we shall be
so darkened, that we shall perish,
not onlie in our beds for a time,
but in our soules and bodies for
euer. And surely in this danger
shal we sleep, vnlesse we betake vs
into the hands of God when we
go to bed. It is a matter of great
moment, little regarded of worldly
men.How the children of God 
                     〈◊〉
                   them to 
                     〈◊〉
                   rest in the night. But the children of God
farre otherwise betake themselues
to their corporall rest, for they
make their sleepe an image of their
death, and their bed they enter into,
as into their graue, and in the
morning when the sun and light
appeareth, they take a new occasion,
when they rise to contemplate
of the celestiall and eternall light,
glorifying the name of God, for



his most gratious protection.
            And therefore arise now all yee
seruants of the Lord, cry out in the
night, poure out your hearts like
water, before the face of our liuing
God.
         
         
            The Prayer for the
Euening.
            
               I Thanke thee (good
God, and most mercifull
father) whose
prouidence reacheth
vnto the least of thy
creatures, and thy
fauour and loue alwaies wait vpon
thy children to preserue them:
thou hast executed thy sacred comforts
towards me this day, thou
hast giuen me all things necessary:
and hast suffered none euill to annoy
me. And by thy mightie working,
I haue passed this day, and
am now come to the ende thereof,
entring into the dark and lothsom
night wherin many dangers lurk,
and lie secretlie hidden, to vexe thy
children, if thou preuent them not
in thy wisedome and loue. Haue



regard therefore (good Father)
vnto mee, who am fraile, and soone
fall into many things offensiue
vnto thy Maiestie: and the right
is often polluted with my sinnes,
insomuch as I cannot but accuse
my selfe before thee, that my sleepe
cannot be iustified to be pure, but
euen therein, by dreames, fantasies
of the flesh, and many vaine temptations.
I am often mooued to
consent vnto that which thou lothest,
and can in no wise then performe
what thou louest.
            Sith therfore (my good father)
that I through my sinnes deserue
no fauour but punishment, I appeale
vnto thy mercy in Christ,
beseeching thee for his sake, to annoint
the eies of my heart with
the oyle of thy grace, that though
the naturall man slumber, and in
slumbering fall away by weaknes,
yet my soule may be refreshed this
night, with diligent watchfulnes,
least that the aduersarie sowing
therein the tares of temptation, I
giue consent to sin, and so endanger
both body & soule by my negligence,
Good Father, pardon my



sinnes for thy names sake, be merciful
vnto me, receiue me this night
into thy custodie and safe protection,
let thy grace comfort me, and
let thy continuall fauour defend
me from all perils. And in thy
loue vouchsafe me such comfortable
rest, as thou shalt see expedient
for the refreshment and preseruation
of the helth of my bodie,
which els cannot but waxe feeble,
and be made subiect to such infirmities,
as I shall not be able to
execute my dutie vnto thee.
            In thy name therfore, good Father,
I yeeld my selfe vnto my rest,
wherein let thy holy spirit keepe
the doore of my hart, and thy holy
Angels attend about my bed for
my safetie, for Christ Jesus thy
deare sonnes merits. Amen.
            
            O Lord increase our faith.
         
         
            
            Before we goe to bed.
            The Lorde will graunt his louing
kindnesse in the day, and in
the night will we sing of him, euen
a prayer vnto the God of life. Psal.
42. 8
            
               OH Father, ful of might and loue,
               our castle and our stay:
               Who rulest with thy power aboue,
               The darksome night and day.
            
            
               The day is thine, and night also,
               thou rulest with thy hand:
               Both which were made for man we know,
               and so was sea and land.
            
            
               The sea and land and all the things
               therein, which thou hast plast:
               Thou gauest vs, & madst vs kings,
               to vse them till the last.
            
            
               Which blessings (Lord) this day we haue
               most richlie had frō thee,
               Blesse 
                     ••
                  ke this night, good Lord, we craue,
               keep vs frō danger free.
            
            
               
               Preserue vs when our drousie sleep
               our bodies shall possesse:
               And let not Sathan creepe into,
               nor our poore soules oppresse.
            
            
               But let thy grace preuent his ire,
               let nothing vs annoy:
               Let faith preuaile, let him retire,
               and we good rest enioy.
            
            Tremble and sinne not, examine
your owne hearts vpon your
bed, and be still. Psal. 4. 4.
            O Lord increase our faith.
         
         
            
            Hauing thus farre proceeded
in our progresse, wee must be
forced to take vp our standing-house,
and for a time abide in the
earthly mansions of our bodies,
before we can attaine vnto the end
of our iourney, and be fully possessed of
that absolute heauenly hearts ease.
In which standing house, we must
consider how wee ought to
carry our selues towards
our Queene, the head
and gouernour of
this houshold.
(
                  〈☐〉
               )
            
               IT is a common
matter and necessary
for Princes
and great estates,How Princes and great men vse to deck their houses, where they purpose to abide.
vpon their repaire
vnto any house.
wherin they purpose
to make any small abode, to
take order that the same be cleansed,
swept, garnished, perfumed,
and set in decent and pleasing order,
as well for healths sake as for
somelines, pleasure, and delight.
But much more it behoueth vs,
that haue taken by our lodgings,



and abiding places in these our
mortall bodies, to take order with
our affections,What order wee must take in our bodily houses. wils, and dispositions,
that our conuersations be in
such decent, comely, sweete, and
comfortable order disposed, that
our soules be not annoyd with the
filth and stincke of our corruptions,
while we abide in the same,
but rather that our soules may be
delighted with the sweete odours,
and sacred perfumes of sanctitie
and spirituall graces.
            Wee must therefore like vnto
good Surueyers and ouerseers of
our owne buildings, carefully endeuour,
that all the noysome places
within our building be clensed
and the contagious sincks and
vnseemely filth and rubble, which
disgrace or annoy the same, be cast
out and swept.We must clense the hart aboue all other places. And aboue all, we
must looke into the heart, for there
lieth infinite filthines, and vnles it
be carefully seene vnto, it wil hardly
be throughly clensed,Iere. 17. 9. for the
hart is the place that is most deceitfull
and wicked, yea aboue all the
other parts of the bodie: and therfore
it is demaunded; who can



know it? In so much as the Prophet
argueth,The heart is a subtile corner. that the heart is so
subtil and deceitfull, that vnles we
most narrowly search it, there will
lye hidden filthinesse & corruption,
when we thinke it is well swept
and garnished. It is a dangerous
thing for vs to flatter our selues
in our hearts, saying, our hearts
are cleane,Deut. 29. 19 and we shal haue peace.
and yet the filthines of sin rest in
vs,Acts. 8. 23. and ye roote that bringeth foorth
gall and wormewood, groweth in
our willes & behauiour. But we
must circumcise our hearts,Deut. 30. 6. we
must cut off all peruerse & corrupt
affections, and purge vs of all iniquitie,
wherein we must craue the
assistance of ye spirit of God, which
will purifie our hearts. And hee
that will not thus endeuour to
cleanse this most filthie part of his
house, but resteth stiffe-necked,
and as it were,Acts. 7. 51. of an vncircumcised
hart and eare, not forsaking his
old wicked conuersation, neither
will heare whē God speaketh vnto
him: he doeth as it were, resist
the holy Ghost. And his filthines
will so infect his poore soule,



euen with the leprosie of iniquitie,
that he shall neuer bee suffered to
enter into the sweete habitation of
eternall hartes ease. All the filthy
desires and lustes of the fleshe lye
hidden in the hart, adultery, witchcraft,
hatred, debate, emulation,
wrath, contention, sedition, heresies,
enuie, murthers, drunkennes,
gluttony, and such other filthy
annoyances, which vnless they
bee swept out and cast off, they
will infect the whole house of our
bodies, with such vnsauery and
noysom pollutions, yt our mouthes
will be defiled with cursing, lying,
and bitternesse, our eyes with
lust, our handes with touching
vncleane thinges, our feete shall
not bee able to walke the way of
righteousnesse, but take the waye
of sinne, and all the whole howse
of our earthly tabernacle shall bee
so inuironed with filthinesse, that
all our progresse will bee turned to
our disprofite:We must cast away the dregs of old Adam, & imbrace Christ. and our hearts ease
to heart sore. Wherefore let vs cast
away al the dregs of ye old Adam,
which is vnrighteousnes, wherein
wee sometime walked, and let vs



deeke vs with the workes of the
new man which is renued in
knowledge, after the image of
Christ, who is the way in whome
we must walke, the truth which
we must imbrace, and the life
wherein we must liue for euermore,
which way, as it is pure,
cleane, sweete, and without turning,
so must we be pure, cleane,
and without sin, not turning back
vnto iniquitie. And as that truth
is vnchangeable, plaine, and without
deceit, so must we be simple,
constant, & faithfull: and as that
life is without all blemish, euerlasting,
and neuer ending: so must
we be quickned, liuing without all
blemish, and spot of sin, in righteousnes
& holines for euer. Therefore
let vs consider, what are the
principall and chiefe ornaments to
bewtifie this our mansion house,
being thus swept and clensed from
the former filthines, that when we
shall remoue from this our earthly
tabernacle, we may take that way,
depart hence in that truth, and so
for euer liue in that life, Christ Jesus,
who will bring vs vnto his



heauenly habitation, the absolute
end of our progresse, and the full
accomplishment of our heauenlie
hearts ease.
            Let vs then consider,Wherewithall we must adorn the houses of our soules in this life. that as the
filthines which we haue cast out,
was most vgly, filthy, and noysome
vnto vs, because they were
the works of the flesh, which bring
foorth death. So we must adorne
vs with sanctitie and holines, the
works of the spirit, which will be
a most comely bewtifying of these
our houses of claie, and leade vs
vnto life. We must now therefore
sweeten and perfume our hearts,The fruites of the spirit, must bewtifie our earthly tabernacles.
with loue, with ioy, with inward
peace, with long suffering, gentlenes,
goodnes, faith, meekenes, temperance,
and all godly conuersation,
casting away all desire of vaine
glory, not prouoking one another,
nor enuying one another, that being
dead to sin, and liuing to God,
we may declare the same in this
our standing house, by an innocent
and sanctified life.
            Hauing thus clensed our houses
from filthines and corruptions of
the flesh, and decked the same with



the ornaments of the spirite: It is
necessarie that wee should proceede
to the execution of our callings, according
to the rule of the diuyne
word:We liue not to our selues, nor for our selues. knowing this, that wee liue
not vnto our selues, but vnto god:
not for our selues, but for our brethren:
for whose sakes wee are
bound to trauell in our callings, &
to execute our offices and functions
as becommeth vs, that our calling
in Christ may bee made sure, euen
in this life.
            There are in euery body many
members,Euery body hath many members. and euery member hath
his seuerall place, office, and function.
Euery kingdome is a body,
wherein there is a gouernour, and
people, as subiects to be gouerned:
wherein also are many Magistrates,
as the principal members
of that bodie: and also there are inferiour
members, preserued and
defended by the more glorious. Euery
familie is a body, where is a
father, and where commonly are
children, where are maisters, there
are seruants. All these hauing
seuerall offices and places in this
standing house of our Common



weale, must euery one proceede to
the performance of his calling, in
such sort as there bee not any disorder,
or anie complaining in our
streetes.
            Wee are humblie to thanke our
God,We are to thanke God for our head Queene Elizabeth that hee hath established
our heade in such comely sort, and
endued her with all vertues aunswerable
vnto her high function,
yea, we may sing vnto our Queen
Elizabeth, the Queene of Sabaes
songe, which she made of the happie
gouernment of Salomon. Happie
are thy men may wee say,
               1 King. 10▪ 8. 9. 
               happy
are these thy seruantes,
               The Queen of Saba to Salomon. 
               which
stande here before thee, and heare
thy wisedome. Blessed bee the
Lord thy God, which loued thee,
to set thee in the Throne of Englande,
because the Lorde loued
Englande for euer, and made thee
Queen to do equitie & righteousnes.

It is verified in her. That the
king by iudgment maintaineth the
country How haue we (the poore
members of this body, whereof
she is the head) beene maintayned
preserued, conducted and blessed
in her gouernement? No nation


               
hath tasted the like benefites, by
peace,No nation hath tasted like blessings as England. by plentie, by health, and
especially (which is most sweete) by
the continuall vse of the worde of
God: whereby hath beene discried
most filthie, drosse and dregges,
and the rubble of errors which in
former time stuffed vp the house of
our land, so, that we could not
walke in the truth without perill.
And now in great measure swept
and cleansed, and garnished, adorned
and beautified with spirituall
ornaments, of iudgement, of equitie,
of mercie, and truth: in so
much as we may sing, that mercie
and truth are met togither,

righteousnesse and peace haue kissed
each other. The God of peace
preserue her, that she may be (if it
please him) our head while we stay
in this mansion of the flesh.
            O that there were such a resemblance
of performance of duetie in
euery of the members, as is apparant
in the head, that the subiects
could answere in like sorte for
their obedience, as her Maiestie
for gouernment: then should we
haue a most comfortable abiding



in this our standing house of the
flesh: then should all the noysome
corruptions of enuie, malice, reuenge,
gall and bitternesse of the
hart, be turned into loue, meekenesse,
mercie & peace: then should
we haue no leading into captiuitie,
no imprisonments, no murthers,
no strife, no debate, no cause
of complaining amongst vs. But
we must looke into our dueties,How subiects must fashion themselues in obedience.
and fashion our selues, not according
to the former deedes of disobedience,
but as becommeth the
seruants of God, knowing that
we are commanded to obey such
as are appointed to rule ouer
vs:1. Pet. 2. 
                     •
                  . we must submit our selues
vnto all manner ordinance of man
for the Lords sake, whether it be
vnto her Maiestie, as vnto our superiour,
or vnto gouernours, as
vnto them that are sent from her,
for the punishment of euill doers,
but for the praise of them that do
well.
               Exo. 22. 28. We are commanded reuerently
to vse the Judges, and not
to speake euill of the ruler of the
people. Euery soule must subiect it
self to the higher powers, for there



is no power but of God,Rom. 13. 1. 2 and the
powers that are, are ordayned
of God: whosoeuer therefore resisteth
the power, resisteth the
ordinance of God, and they that
resist, they that will not obey and
submit themselues vnto such as
are in authoritie, shall receyue
vnto them selues iudgemente:
they shall bee punished,The disobedient shalbe punished not onely
by the censure of the iudge in this
worlde, but by the iudgement of
God.
            This then is not the least thing
that we should haue care of, while
we are in this house, to cast out of
our hartes all disobedience, and so
beautifie the same with vnfayned
loue vnto her Maiestie: who so
wisely ordereth and gouerneth this
our standing house,Q. Elizabeth aideth her distressed people. and louingly
entertaineth euery member of this
bodie, that shee suffereth not the
least, the weakest, the poorest, nor
the basest to bee distressed, wronged,
or abused, but shee extendeth
present reliefe, comfort, and assistance.
            What an vnnaturall member is
it then, that will raise it selfe vp,



to offend this so sacred a head: nay
what member is it, vnlesse hee bee
ouermuch infected with the poyson
of enuie, that will not striue by
all possible strength to performe
the dutie of a true subiect in whatsoeuer
office, calling or authority
he bee placed: although very dangerous
members haue beene found
in this body:Withered members of the body of the commō wealth. but they were withered
& dryed vp with the scorching
sunne of vaine glorie, so that they
in their callings could bring forth
no fruite, but very rottennesse of
heart, wherein lurked nothing but
the eating wormes of enuie, the
viperous affection of hatred vnto
the truth, and consequentlie diuelish
desires to disturbe, nay, to subuert
and confounde the whole body.
But their rottennes, and filthinesse
haue beene happily founde
out and they iustly cut off.
            Let vs therefore that now litte
in a time wherein euery man may
walke in his dutie aright, while it
is to day, yea, while wee are in
this earthly tabernacle,We must all wel agree in our callings and therein
haue the comfortable vse of
the worde to teach and direct vs:



let vs all endeuour to keepe a direct
course in euery of our particuler
callings, yt we all may be found
liuely and profitable members of
this our common weale.
            And no doubt (which I heartely
wish in the Lord) but all our
gouernours knowe what belongeth
vnto their christian duties,
wherein they ought to consecrate
themselues wholly,Gouernors must endeuour to preserue the common wealth. to the benefite,
profite, honour and quiet of this
our publique stare, wherein they
are appointed to gouerne, not sparing
any labour, care, expences,
toile of minde or bodie, no not their
liues, to preserue and keep this our
Common weale, in all happy felicity.
And as in these our sacred gouernours
and magistrates, there
appeareth a continuall working &
watchfulnes for the maintenaunce
and vpholding of this publique
weale: So in vs that are to be gouerned,
there is a necessitie of resolute
obedience and dutie vnto
their authority,Necessity of obedience laide vpon subiects. laid vpon vs. And
forasmuch as we see by experience,
that the wisdome, loue, and zeale
of our gracious superiour gouernour,



doth in some measure seeme
to surmount her authority, in commanding
vs, let our humilitie, loue
and free obedience towardes her,
and the gouernours vnder her, be
greater then our ciuill subiection:
And let our hartes in all fulnes be
fraught with such dutiful desire, to
frame our whole affections to the
will of the Magistrates, that there
may be no occasion giuen them to
lift vp the sword of iustice against
any of vs, for they beare not the
sword for nought: hee that offendeth
shall be punished, and euery euill
member of this body shall bee
cut off by the same.Euery good member is praysed and receiueth reward. But such as
are profitable & helping members,
shall not onely not taste of punishment,
but be praised: and euery good
endeuour shal receiue his rewarde:
yea, and whosoeuer is grieued amongst
vs, if it be the foote, then ye
head it selfe, and the most especiall
members of the bodie, will haue
regarde vnto the same, and encline
help thereunto, as vnto themselues.
            Who therefore woulde not endeuour
with al force, to answere in



dutie what is offered and administred
vnto vs,Obedience the prop of our quiet. from these higher
powers? for take away obedience,
and we cannot but fall into many
miserable calamities, while we are
in this howse of our mortall bodies.
A priuate howse wee see is
well ordered, when seruants yeeld
obedience to their maisters, and
children humility to their parents:
But turne it contrary, and there
followeth present confusion: how
much more will the calamitie bee
great, and the mischiefe intollerable,
if there shoulde not bee true
loyalty in the subiectes towardes
their gouernors, as there is godly
carefulnes in the gouernours for
the preseruation of the subiect?
            Wee runne the most of vs, and
especially which are the inferiour
sort, into a most rash breach of the
lawes carefully made by our superiours,
and it argueth in vs inconstancy,
and bewrayeth in vs that
our heartes are not fully cleansed
from grose enormities. And therfore
if it will rest in this house of
our earthly bodies, in hope when
we depart hence, to attaine vnto



that spiritual home, that sacred Citie
which wee seeke, that place of
perpetuitie and euerlasting ioy. We
must enter againe into our hearts
and thrust out the olde grosse desires,
and corrupt affections there
lurking, which breake forth oftentimes
to the breach of the lawes of
our common weale,God seeth our walkings. which should
be kept by vs inuiolable. But especially
wee therein violate the
lawes of our God, who looketh on
vs, who considereth our waies,
and beholdeth our proceedinges,
howsoeuer we thinke he seeth vs
not.
            It might be thought a superfluous
thing to set downe perticularly
wherein we offend grosely, but
for that it is a thing necessary that
they should be considered and reformed,
I will briefly call to mind
some such as I wish especially
were redressed: Among which, as
the most ougly before God and
good men,Pride, a most vglie sinne before God, is Pride, a peeuish euill,
& a flattering conceit of our selues,
that we are that which indeed we
are not, and indeede wee make our
selues monsters, and are not, for



God hauing created vs seemely,
and the most glorious of all other
creatures, we of our selues deform
our selues, & marre by our mischief
what God hath made in his mercy.
But the beginning hereof, euen
of our pride, is, to fall away from
God, and to turne our hearts from
our maker. Being falne from God
we are cast downe vnto Sathan.
and turning our hearts from our
maker, wee become one in consent
with our miscarier: & yet how go

                  ••
               ehand in hand with this wicked
one, by whome we were deceiued,
euen in the humour of pride, in the
beginning? and can not yet take
heed of his wiles, wherof the greatest
is this filthy fashiō pride: And
the pride of England,
               The pride of England. is, as it were
set vp vpon the highest mountaine
of the worlde, seene and scorned euen
of very infidels of the earth 
                  •
                such
as knowe not God, make
meruaile of our monstrous attire
which exceedeth not onely in cos
                  •

oh pull it downe, it is no

not with the guest which
lodgeth in vs,Pride polluteth all the corners of our house. the spirite of God: it
is no fitte ornament to decke the
howse of our silly soules, for it
stinketh and polluteth all corners
of the house: oh remoue it, and
sende euery Countrey his fashion
againe: bee not beholden to any
nation for such trumpery, neyther
to the garmentmaker, whose study
therein though it please the vaine-glorious
for a time, it will bring
repentance, too late to the worke
and the workeman. It is from the
Court come into the Countrey, a
dangerous euill, and hath infected
the poore plowman, that an years
wages sufficeth not one suite of
attire. If I should tel all, the carter
woulde steppe in with his courtly
gards,The cart
                     ••
                   and plowman exceedeth in pride. and will defie him that is
not of the fashion: men and women,
the rich and the poore, the
olde and the yong, are too far gone
in this sicknesse, the Lorde giue a
timely medicine, least wee perish
therein. We might (were we mindfull
of our dangers) call to minde
what diuersities of diseases, and
strange maladies, haue beene amongst



vs of late, as though the
Lord would say, as ye change your
affections vpon vaine things, & as
yee are neuer satisfied wt variety of
fashions, falling dayly from me, so
will I make you know by the varietie
of my punishments, yt I haue
yet in store more strange calamities
then yet ye haue felt. And shal we
not yet cast off these enormities?
Surely it is so dislike that wedding
garment, wherwith we must
enter into our heauēly harts ease,
and it is so strange vnto the Lord,
that he wil not know vs to be his:
oh that it were reformed, for euery
man and woman wade in excesse
in this sinne, without reproofe, let
it be reformed, lest God reprooue
vs.
            Should wee let passe some little
recompting of another grosse euill,
whose reproofe is deseruedly set
downe by the sacred censure of
God, and therefore I will shewe
what the Lorde himselfe speaketh
against it, yt I may be irreproueable,
1. Tim. 6 10 Couetousnesse the 
               The desire of money is ye root
of all euill. Oh what a short and
sharpe sentence is this? If it be the



roote of all euill, then hath it no
doubt many braunches of euill,
therefore is it very vnfit to rest in
this house of our soules, for they
that haue thus lusted extraordinarily
for this worldly mucke, haue
erred from the faith, and pearced
themselues through with many sorrows.
See what a most dangerous
euill this couetousnes is, it disquieteth
both the body and minde
here. The whole house is out of order
where this filthynes lieth, and
therefore aboue all other euils it is
to bee reformed for that it distempereth
vs here, and stoppeth the
wayes that should leade vs to our
heauenly hartes ease. Woe be vnto
ye riche, saith Christ, for yee haue
your consolatiō here. It is a sinne
so displeasing vnto the Lord, that
hee pronounced destruction vnto ye
people of Israel,Ierem. 
                     〈◊〉
                  
                for that from ye
least vnto the greatest of them, euery
one was giuen vnto couetousnes.
Let vs therefore haue a
care to reforme this enormitie, and
let vs cast it out of our hearts, for
it breedeth many euils: yet this euill
aboue all other, seemeth vnpunishable,



nay rather commendable.Couetousnes vnpunishable.
because it seemeth good husbandry.
But all that are in the right way
vnto that heauenly harts ease, will
cast it out of this their standing
house, as durt, dung, and vnprofitable
rubble.
            This euil of couetousnes, draweth
vnto it another dāgerous euil,Flatterers.
flattery, which is an euill that draweth
light conceited mē into vain-glory.
But all flattery is as ye kisse
of an enemy, as was Iudas, and
therefore are all flatterers to bee
reiected, & to be cast out of this cō
               mon
society of the mēbers of this
body, and to be cut off as vnprofitable
and perillous, yet these prosper
in the worlde: & fare far better
then such as speake the truth from
their hearts. Cast them off.
            Certain idle persons, whose infections
do annoy a great parte of
this bodie, are to bee cured or cut
off, for they are daungerous members,
for whose reformation haue
beene made many notable prouisions,
by sundry sage & graue actes,
and howses of correction for vagarants,
erected in euery shire. But



it falleth out, that the number of
such daungerous weeds rather increase
then diminish, to the great
detriment of our quiet abiding in
this standing howse of our common
weale: wherein I suppose the
negligence of inferiour officers, is
a great occasion of their increase.
            I haue trauelledm any shires,
and it appeareth that there is little
or no executiō of these good lawes,
greatly to be lamented, not only in
regard of the common quiet which
by them is like to be disturbed, but
also in regard of the persons themselues,
who endaunger their own
estates, by their vngodly loosenes
and lewdnes of life. The common
wealth also loosing their labour &
trauel, which might in some measure
steed their brethren, if with a
sound and godly disposition, they
would frame their lims to labour,
yet eat they that which is gottē by
the sweat of other men. The number
of these persons is great, the
persons themselues for the most
part, able of body, hardy, stout harted,
and fit to be imploid in strong
affaires, a number of them yet



counterfeyting impotency, and deforming
themselues with rotten
ragges, passe through the country
halting in the day time, and oftentimes
annoy the good members of
this publike weale in the night.
These passe and repasse by such as
haue authority to examine, to commit,
to punish, and to reforme their
disorder, and yet fewe or none set
hand to redresse it. If the Citie of
London be viewed, the streetes
within it, & the suburbes & fieldes
neere it, will yeeld of young & old,
men and women, able of body to
serue maisters, and to labour for
their liuing, a great number of vagabondes.
And which is most lamentable,
the young and tender
girles & lads of all ages, lie vnder
stalles in the streets by great companies
vnder hedges in the fieldes,
& no man taketh them vp, to bring
them to some faculty to get their
liuings, as is commanded, but suffer
them to wallow stil in idlenes,
vntill they be past to be reclaimed,
falling into breach of the lawes,
and so are eaten vp with vntimely
death: who if they had beene carefully



prouided for, they might haue
proued good members of the weale
publike. It is no new thing, and
would God it might bee nowe at
the eldest estate, that these euilles
might be cut off, or in some measure
reformed. The roote being cut
in sunder, the branches would wither,
for there are diuers occasions
giuen and tollerated, whereby they
thus grow into these idle and vagrant
courses. It seemeth lawful,
for it is tollerated, that euery man
at his pleasure may leaue his trauel,
and go to the play house, bowling
Allyes. Beare gardens, Ale
houses, Tauernes, and gaming,
where they lose their time, cōsume
their thrift, and offende the lawes
of God, and her Maiesty. And the
Sabboth day which shoulde bee
sanctified with prayer, and hearing
of the worde, is prophaned with
these accustomed euils, which if
they were cast out as vnprofitable,
in this our earthly abiding place,
wee should the more sweetely passe
on the way to our heauenly harts
ease. For out of these euils of idlenesse
and loytering, spring many



noysome thinges, that blemish
our body here, as filthines of the
flesh, drunkennes, gluttony, swearing,
and blasphemy, forgetfulnes
of God, and contempt of Magistrates,
wherewith our abode here
being grossely defiled, such will be
our vnsauery dwelling, that our
spiritual guest the holy Ghost, wil
refuse to abide with vs.
            I herefore,2. Tim. 6. 11. to 16. O yee men of God,
whom the spirit of God directeth,
flie these things, and followe after
righteousnes, godlines, faith, patience,
and meekenesse, fight the
good fight of faith, lay holde of
eternal life, wherunto ye are called,
& haue professed a good profession
before many witnesses. Keepe on
the course ye haue begun, without
spot, & vnrebukeable, vntil the appearing

            A short praier against errours
& scismes.
            
               WE humbly pray thee
most merciful father
in mercy to looke
down vpō the dangerous
estate of thy
Church which is much pestered &
infected wt the suds of errour, insomuch
as it seemeth to be swallowed
vp of the perilous inundations
of sectes and scismes coined by the
subtilties of that wicked one Sathan,
whose practise is euer from ye
fall of Adam, to stop the pure proceedinge
of the Gospell, by the
peruerse workes of darkenesse.
Sanctifie therefore thy children,
with thine especiall grace, and manifest
thy truth vnto them, that
by the light therof they may know
how to shape the way to the true
seruice of thee. And let them be
able to discerne betweene truth and
errour, yt they may be alwaies free
from heresies, and not be intangled



with false doctrine, nor defiled
we the lothsome pitch of mans inuentions,
but being indued with
the purity of heauenly knowledge,
wee may all ioyne together in one
truth, wherein we may liue and
dye: and so in Christ thy Sons
merites, liue with thee in
heauen eternally,
Amen.
            Oh Lord increase my faith.
         
         
            
            A short Prayer in crosses,
troubles and afflictions.
            
               OH Father, full of mercie,
and loue in Jesus
Christ, haue compassion
vpon me, whome
thou hast touched with
thy hand of correction. Thou hast
found me out in my sinnes, and
beaten me, thy hand lyeth heauie
vpon me, I am not able to sustaine
the burden of my miseries.
I can not but faint in my distresses,
and run too and fro for help,
but loe, oh Lord, my crosses increase,
and thy anger I can not
beare: wherefore good Father in
Christ, haue compassion vpon me,
recomfort me againe, be pleased
with me, and take thy heauie displeasure
from mee: and though
my sinnes haue deserued more then
I can beare, the merites of thy
Sonne are greater then my sinns.
And therefore for his sake come
againe in loue, and by thy mercie
and power, repayre my decayes,



relieue my wants, and cure my
diseases, speake the word, and it
shall be done, all things obey thy
voyce, wherefore blesse thy creatures
all to my vse, that I may
haue them all in this life blessed
vnto me, and I blessed by thee in
Christ, Amen.
            
            O Lord increase our faith.
         
         
            A short Prayer, that all
men may liue vprightly
in their calling.
            
               LOrd God Almightie,
mercifull & pure,
be pleased in fauour
to consider the weaknes
of man, and so
sanctifie vs with thy grace, that
we may all confesse our sinnes, and
cry to thee for pardon, all acknowledge
our weakenes, and cry to
thee for strength, all see our ignorance,
and come to thee for knowledge
how to behaue vs in this



mortall life in our seuerall callings,
that thereby both thou
mayst be glorified, our bretheren
comforted, and our selues relieued:
that when we shall be called
by thee to render accompt of our
stewardships, we may be able to
stand before thee acquitted from
all that eyther sinne, the deuill, or
our corrupt flesh may charge vs
with, not through our owne deseruings,
which in our best endeuours
are euill euermore, but in
the merites of thy Sonne Christ,
Amen.
            
            O Lord increase our faith.
         
         
            
            The conclusion, wherein
is exhorted vnto watchfulnes, for

               HAuing attained thorough
the diuine assistance
of my good
God. vnto the ende
of this my poore trauaile,
I can not but conclude with
an earnest intreatie of all such as
couet this eternall hearts ease,
that they wil in this standinghouse
of the body, call continually to
minde, the absolute end of this
Progresse of pietic, which principally
tendeth vnto the finishing of
the iourney and pilgrimage of this
life, in all godlines, faith, zeale, and
ardent loue of that heauenly mansion,
which so farre excelleth this
earthly tabernacle, as the purest
gold exceedeth the filthiest and most
lothsome dirt & dung of the earth:
and the hearts ease thereof, is



much farre sweeter, then the hearts
ease of this world, as the sweetest
honey passeth in sweetnes the most
bitter gall: and happy is that man,
that soonest atteineth to the enioying
thereof but in part, that is, eyther
in this life, through the quietnesse
of conscience in our Christ,
or being departed hence, hath the
fruition thereof in spirit, expecting
the comming of that great Judge,
when soule and body shall enioy
the same at full. Oh let vs all
therefore, in all godly watchfulnesse,
in this our pilgrimage which
shortly shall haue ende, haue due
regard vnto our walking, that we
walke not awry. Let vs dayly examine
our selues, & consider with
iudgement, that we shall all appeare
before that high Judge, frō
whome, no step of our progresse
shall be hidden, and whome soeuer
he shall finde halting, or walking
awry, he will bereaue of that most
sweete hearts ease in heauen, and
will giue most sowre and vnsauery
hearts sore in hell. If I should
discourse of the comforts which
shal be shewed vnto such as walke



this progresse, and end the same as
they ought, & as they are cōmaunded,
alas, I am as vnable, nay,
there is no toong of man or angell
can neerer declare ye deapth of the
sweetnes therof, then I am able to
number ye starres in the firmamēt:
the excellencie thereof, is such & so
vnspeakeable, as no hart is able to
comprehend or conceiue the same:
but let this satisfie all curious conceits,
that, that our heauenly mansion,
our euerlasting tabernacle,
that our spirituall inheritance, is
such and so full fraught with such
variety of ioy, with such vnspeakable
comforts, with such endlesse
felicitie, and surpassing glory: yea,
such is the fulnesse of all spirituall
contentation there, that we shall
not couet to see more, the eare desire
to heare more, the body haue
will to feele more, nor ye hart thirst
to conceiue more, then we shall
there for euermore enioy, howsoeuer
they are now, whilst we are in
ye flesh, far remoued frō our grosse
conceits, and euery report of them
seemeth dark vnto our senses, vntil
our all sufficient God, our Christ,



and our Sauiour, shall himselfe
appeare againe in the clowdes:
then shall our vnderstandings be
opened, then shall our senses be
lightened, and then shall we most
plainely see, euidently perceiue, and
to our absolute comfort taste of
the fulnesse thereof, yea, then shall
we see our God face to face, when
there shall be an end of all our trauailes,
of all our toyle, of all our
carke, care, feare, trouble, and irkesome
passage: then shall we hunger
no more, thirst no more, then
shall we neede no friend, nor feare
any foe, then shall we that are here
now in prison, be set at libertie, and
we that are pressed downe with
misery shall be raysed vp to comfort:
yea, then shall be an end of
all things that now discomfort vs.
Oh let vs therfore be euer thankfull
vnto our God, that hath not
only prouided this heauenly harts
ease, and endlesse ioyes for vs, but
hath also layde out the way thereunto,
and giuen vs his owne hand
to leade vs, yea, himself to conduct
vs vnto the same. Let vs without
ceasing therefore pray vnto him,



and let vs be alwayes in good comfort
in him: yea, let vs groane in
our hearts, with most longing expectation,
for the appearing of him
that shall deliuer vs, and free vs
frō dangers, and settle vs in these
ioyes. And let vs cut off all lets
and impediments, how neere or
deere soeuer they bee vnto vs,
whether it be the eye, the hand, or
the foote, let vs cast away all excuses,
wife, children, lands, goods,
gold, and siluer, honours, dignities,
yea, let not life it selfe be deere
vnto vs, if it seeme to hinder vs
from a speedy passage vnto our
God: knowing, that so long as
we are heere in this earthly house,
our estate is miserable, our passage
dangerous, our pleasures perilous,
and we wander as wretches
through many miseries.
            We are heere but as in a strange
countrey, farre off from our owne
home, whereunto we must endeuor
to attaine in all simplicitie,
carrying onely with vs, as our
staffe to stay vs vp, the merites
of our Christ, and for our defence
heere, the swoord of the spirit,



whereby we shall be able to walke
through all the perils and dangers,
yea the fire & water, through
which we are to passe. Let vs expect,
yea and wish with ioy that
most happy daye, wherein that
sweete trompet of our sauing
Christ shall sound out to call vs:
let vs hearken for it continually,
and let vs thinke it will sound to
morrow. Then to morrow shall be
our merry day, for then to morrow
shall we meete our God, that will
carry vs home with him, that in
body and soule we may dwell with
him for euermore. Oh come Lord
Jesu, come quickly, and let all the
people of God say, Amen.
            
            Wee are not yet come to
the rest and the inheritance
which the Lorde our God
giueth vs.

            The Authour to the
Booke.
            STep foorth and stagger not my
silly Booke: Dread not to draw
neere vnto the Pallace of thy
Princely Patronesse, whose sacred
Scepter shall be thy sufficient safetie,
and whose worthy wisedome,
will way the willingnes of thine
vnwoorthie woorkemaster, who
though he below, yet he is loyall,
howsoeuer homely he hath compiled
thee: he in all dutie and humilitie
presenteth thee, though a
worke vnworthie to be patronized
with so puissant a Princesse. But
heerein comfort thee, that her Maiesties
royall countenance graceth
the present that carrieth shew of
true loue and loyaltie, and
accepteth the gift, as is
the minde of the
giuer.

vised veritate.

            A deuout Prayer, for the
preseruation of her Maiesties
forces now at Sea.
            
               MOst omnipotent
maker, and guider
of all worlds,
thou onely searchest
& fadomest
the botome of all
hearts, consciences, and conceits,
and in them seest the true originall
of all actions intended. Thou that
by thy foresight doest truely discerne
of al actions intended. Thou
that by thy foresight doest truely
discer

               e, how no malice of reuēge,
nor quittance of iniurie, nor desire
of bloudshead, nor greedines of
luker, hath bred the resolution of
our now set out army, but a heedfull
care, and a wary watch, that
no neglect of foes, nor our securitie
of harme, might breede either
danger to vs, or glorie to them.
These being the groundes, thou
that diddest inspire the minds, we
humbly beseech thee with bended



knees, to prosper the worke, 
                  〈◊〉
               
with the best forewinde guide the
iourney, speede the victory, make
the returne the aduancement of
thy glory, the triumph of thy
fame, and suertie of this Realme,
with the least losses of english
bloud. To this deuout petition
Lord giue thy
blessed graunt.
            Amen.
