            WHEN I call to my remembrāce (right vvorshipfull Sir) vvhat our merciful and good God hathe doone for vs, by his vnspeakeable omnipotencie, and also what giftes hee hathe indued man vvithall, vvee can not chuse, but be thankful to him for his vvorthie benefites bestovved vpon vs: vvho so noteth substācially from time to time vvhat vvorthie instrumentes God hath raised vp in all artes and sciences, as some passing in singlenesse of gifts as Aristotle, Galen, Ptolome, Plinie, vvith other, vvith those vvorthie Oratours the Grecians, as Demosthenes, Isocrates, and that vvorthie Romaine the Prince of Eloquence Marcus Tullius Cicero, vvhose excellencie hath surpassed all others, and bene leaders and scholemasters to all others. It vvas not vvithout great cause (right vvorshipful) that man is called Mycrocosmos, that is to say, a little vvorlde: it vvas not vvithout great consideration, that Aristotle calleth him the sercher

of secretes: for vvhat thing is there in this vvorld but man hath sought it out, be it neuer so harde or obscure? vvhat vertue in stone or plant or any grovving thing: yea the vertue of beasts, fishes, fovvles, and serpentes, and vvhatsoeuer is conteined in the earth, aire, vvater, or fyre, mettals, mynes of golde, siluer, leade, tinne, yron &c. In fine, how excellēt in al philosophie, asvvell naturall as morall, as Arithmetike, Geometrie, Astronomie, Cosmographie, & besides all these, those moste excellent historiographers: and yet in my mynd this surpasseth all others, that is to say, to be an excellent Oratour, singular in orations, pythie and ingenious in vvriting Epistles, for therby is brought to passe the moste excellent things for publike gouernment, as also for euery mannes priuate cause and vse: for vvho knovveth not vvhere learning and good gouernement consisteth, their orations bee of moste excellent force to set foorth hovve tymes haue bene passed, vvith the tyme present, and also to giue vvarning, and foresee for time to come, hovve the good and vertuous haue merited and receyued perpetuall fame, as to the ouerthrovve of the vvicked too their reproche and ignomie. So (right vvorshipfull) this booke vvhich I present vnto you, is stufte vvith pleasant orations, fine epistles, singular complaintes, vvith matter mixt so fitly and aptly to serue the turne of all persons, not curious nor filled full of obscure and darke sense, but playne and pleasant, depending and ansvvering one an other, vvith most delectable matter for all causes, as vvell incouraging the bashfull person and covvarde to bee valiant, as the vvorthie ladies and damselles in

their amorous Epistles, feruente complaintes of iniuries handled moste excellently: And yet I confesse not so graue and vvorthie matter as your vvoorship deserueth to haue. Therfore I craue pardon at your hands for this my rashe enterprise, trusting in God you vvill receiue it in good part as a token of my good vvill tovvards you, and though it yeld not so pleasant a grace in the Englishe toung as it dothe in the Frenche, the vvhiche it vvas vvritten in, I knovve youre vvoonted maner and good nature is to take smal thinges in good part, vvhich hath imboldened me at this present, to dedicate this booke of the Treasurie of Amadis of France vnto your vvorship, & vvhen god sendeth to my hand any other, I do intend to make ye partaker therof.

            To the gentle Reader.
            
               A VERY frend of myne (most gentle reader) instantly desired me, to english him this french booke, intituled the Treasurie of Amadis, the whiche when I had well perused it, pleased me not a little, as wel for the elegant phrase thereof, as for the diuersities and arguments therin wrapped and inclosed. For truly it aboundeth with such eloquent orations and wyse counsels: with such swéete and delicate Epistles and letters especially of loue, so curteously and annably handled: with suche exhortations and admonitions so prudently penned: with suche lamentations & complaints so sorowfully and mournfully expressed: with suche consolations and comforts in aduersitie, so frendly and louingly pronounced: with such answers and replications so ingeniously inuented: with reproches and tauntes so bitingly and bitterly spoken: with requ

For what a dullarde is he, that wise counsell. vertuous exhortations, friendly admonitions, wittie and subtill persuasions shall not quicken and reuiue? and how farre without sense is he, whom amiable, fine, and beautifull ladies with their ticklyng and flatteryng wordes shall not awake, stirre vp, and call to their lure, wanton fansie, & feruent lou

               ? What stonie and harde hearte hath he, that with the glittering and twinkeling of the eye, the abundant teares, the dulcet and swéete parolls of his paramour (wherwith this fine flattering booke is infarced) will not be mollifyed and melted? And how depely are they drowned in sorrowe, that with godly and vertuous consolation will not be comforted? What weake and cowardly heartes and stomackes

haue they that will not be stirred or moued with the rhetorical & eloquent orations, the vehement persuasiōs, and liberall promises and rewards of wise, noble & worthie capitains, pluck vp their harts, inuade their enimies, & (for worthie renoume sake, & immortall glorie) fight stoutly and corageously, as Amadis, the king of England & France, & Flor

Wherfore (gentle Reader) let it not lothe thée (I pray thée) to reade this fine and fruitfull booke, nor to ensue the honest and vertuous lessons, the prudent admonitions and good counsels of the same: for thou shalt not at any tyme (as I thinke) repent thée more for the reading of it, than I for the translating therof, the which although it be but rude and vnpleasant, yet my mynde and hand were neyther negligent nor slacke to profite thée, and to english it

And therefore my Lordes (sauing yours better aduice, and opiniō) my mind is, that all we, doing and following the interpretation of our prince, should counsell him, that he make himselfe strong with money and men & for they are the sinnews and the spirites of war & peace, by the meanes whereof, all earthly kings are mainteyned in their force and authoritie, considering that greate treasure truely is to pay the souldiers that cause kings to reign, the which by no occasion shoulde any other where he spent, or else it shoulde be a very sacriledge, seing that it nameth it selfe holy. And thus doing he may maintein

               MY Lords it séemeth beholding your countenance that the Earle of Clares opinion is wholly approued: for I sée already that the most part of you do agree vnto his saying, without hearing the contrarie part debated: neuerthelesse I trust my Lordes to make you all, and hereafter the king presently to knowe and vnderstande how greatly I desire to bée a friende vnto him, and to you, and to all hys realme. The Earle of Clare not long since hath counseled that the King your maister shoulde fortifie himselfe in the strength and multitude of straunge knightes, the whyche hée counseled to bée called for

                   and that from all the partes of the worlde.

I estéem that there is none of this assistance that doth presume or thinke that I speake otherwise than reason, and the good loue that I beare you doth monish me: for (God be thanked) I am such a one that I may as easely passe and set by the greatest prince my neigbour, as he may passe and set by me: but finding my self and being in so noble a companie, among whome I haue receiued so great honoure and fauor, I had rether (God be my witnesse) neuer to haue bin borne, than to bowe and turne. Thus my Lordes ye ought promptly and diligently to thynke vpon this matter, least that hereafter ye repent you with too much leysure.

                  arde, wherein he resolueth the pluralitie of aduises and counselles that was giuen him. In the first Booke.
               MY greate fréendes I am well assured that the loue which ye beare me, and the desire to do me seruice, hath set you in these difficulties, and I beléeue that there is not he of you all, that hath not spokē as nigh the truth, as was possible for him to do, and so, that your aduises be so good, that they cannot be better: yet this is a thing sure and certaine, that the kings of the earth be not estéemed greate for the number of places that they possesse, but for the quātitie and multitude of people whom they command and rule. What can a King doe alone? it may bée, that lesse than the moste simplest of hys subiectes: and furthermore, it shoulde be too hard for him, yea truely impossible, withoute people to gouerne and too maynteyne hys estate, had hée neuer so greate a treasure, the whyche cannot be better

emploied, thā to deuide it among those that deserue it. Thus euery man that is of a good iudgement (as I suppose) will say, that good counsell, and the force and strength of men is the true treasure. And yet if ye will know this thing the better, ye sée that this by the selfesame meanes made Alexander so great, Iulius Caesar so strong, and gentle Haniball with many other, the which haue gotten by their name immortalities and by tresoring vp of men and not of gold, they were made Kings, Emperors, and Monarches: for they knew liberally to distribute their money to those whose merites they knew, and to entertaine them so graciously, that they might call themselues Lords both of hearts and of bodies, wherby they were serued with great fidelitie. Therfore my good friendes, I pray you all as effectuously as I may possible, that ye will ayde and helpe me as much as ye may, to recouer those good and valiant Knightes, whether they be of this countrie or strangers, the whiche I promise you by the faith and worde of a king, to entreat and honor in such sort and wise, that they shall haue cause to praise and to content themselues: for you are not ignoraunt, that the better we are accompanied, the more we shal be feared and redouted of our enimies, and you the better kepte, ntertayned and estéemed. And if there be any vertue in me, you may easily iudge, that the auncients for the new (whilest I liue,) shal not be forgotten: therfore none of you ought to delay the request that I make vnto you, but obey it, the which thing I pray you againe, and expresly commaunde you, and that incontinently euery one of you particularly do name those vnto me whom ye know, and as yet to in are evnknown, and for this intēt that they (if there be any in this Court) may obtaine and get such rewardes of vs, that they whiche are absent, may be affectionate to come and serue vs, and also to pray them, that they depart not from our company without our knowledge.

And thus we ought not to feare, but to leaue off all doubte, to lyue henceforth in the reputation that we merite and deserue, assuring you my friendes, that they are retyred (if you haue markt it) with a countenance of men not affectionated to see vs agayne, and what so euer that traytor. Barsinan hath sayde, our King is not dead, for he will come shortly to succour vs. In the meane while I pray you my companions, that none of you be troubled, but to doe and continue as he hath begon, hauing before his eyes, that it is much better to die for libertie, than to liue long in captiuitie and miserie, and that vnder a miserable Prince.

               A Letter of the Princesse Oriane to Amadis, accusing him of vnfaithfulnesse. The second booke and second Chapter.
               MY passion without measure, procéeding of so many causes, dothe constraine my féeble hande to declare by this Letter to you Amadis of Fraunce (an vnfaithful and too periured a louer) the thing that my dolorous heart can hide no longer. For séeing that the vnfaythfulnesse and litle stedfastnesse that you haue vnto me (the which am vnfortunate and forsaken of al good fortune, bycause I loued you aboue all worldly things) is nowe manifest, and also that with so great iniurie you are gone so farre from hence, to drawe neare to hir, the which (considering hir yong age, and small discretion) can not haue in hir the thing to fauor you and to entertaine you: she hathe purposed also to banishe from me for euer this extreame loue that I beare you, seeing that my heauie and poore heart can haue no other vengeance. And if I would take in good part the iniurie and wrong that ye doe me, it shoulde be but great folly in me, to will well vnto the most vnthankefull, for whome to loue perfectly, I hate all things and my selfe also. Alas, nowe I perceiue very well (but it is to late) that I submitted too vnfortunately my libertie to so ingrate a person, considering that in satisfaction of my syghings and passions, I sée my selfe mocked, and vnfortunately deceyued. Therefore I forbid you that you neuer come before me, nor where I shall be resident and present, and be ye sure, that the ardent and burning affectiō that I did beare you, is conuerted as you haue demerited, into enmitie and cruell furie. Now therefore get you hence to some other place, to proue (with your periured faithe and swéete wordes) and to abuse other vnfortunate persons as well as me: besides that, you shall hereafter proue that none of your excuses as concerning me, may haue nor take any place, but I not willing to sée you any more, shall lament the reste of my heauie lyfe wyth abundancee of teares, the whiche shall

not cease, but by hir ende, that shall not sorowe to dye, but bicause you are the homicide.
            
            
               The complaint that Amadis made when he receiued Orians vigorous Letter, declaring the mobilitie of fortune, by the which she banished him from hir companie. In the .2. boke and .4. Chapter.
               ALas fortune, that art to light and without roote, by what occasion hast thou preferd and eleuated me among all the best Knightes, afterwardes to bring me to ruine so lightly? Now I perceiue well, that thou mayste doe more euill in an houre, than grace in a thousande yeares: for if in time past thou hast done & gyuen me pleasure or ioy, thou hast robbed me of that euen nowe most cruelly, leauing me in martyrdome muche worsse than death: and seeing it was thy pleasure so to do, why hast thou not at least wise made equall the one with the other? considering thou knowest that at other times thou haste contented me, nor that neyther without mingling of it with sorowes and great troubles. So then thou shouldst haue reserued for me some litle hope, with this crueltie wherewith at this present thou dost torment me, executing in me things incomprehensible in the thoughtes of those that thou dost fauor, the which not knowing this euill, estéeme the pompes, glories, and honors that thou dost lende them, sure and perdurable. Nor they remember not that besides and aboue the torments that their bodies shall suffer to mayntaine them, their soules shall fall in hazard of their saluation. Therefore if with the eyes of vnderstanding (the which the souereine Lord hath giuē them) they might sée thy mobilitie, they should desire rather thyne aduersities, thā thy light prosperities, although it be confirmable to their sensualitie: for why? by thy flattering and wantonnesse, thou dost bring them to ruine, and at the last they are constrayned to enter into the laberinth of martyrdome, hauing no power at

any time to come out againe. But aduersities are clean contrarie, in so muche that if a man paciently resist them, auoyding disordinate apetite and ambition, he is lifted vp from this lowe place to glory euerlasting. And yet I most vnfortunate, could not chuse this good parte, considering that if all the worlde were mine, and taken from me by thée, hauing only the good grace and fauor of my Ladie, that shoulde be sufficient to maintaine me in all honor and prosperitie: but that fayling me, it is impossible for me by any maner of meanes to liue and continue. Therefore I heséech thée, for the fauor and payment of my faithfulnesse, that thou giue me not death with anguishe. But if thou be licensed to take my life from me, that thou make diligent haste, taking compassion on him, of whose torment that he shall haue (if he liue any longer) thou art ignorant.
            
            
               A cmplaint of the like argument that goeth before, the which Amadis sent to his Father.
               O King Perion my Lorde and father, you shall haue very little occasion to be heauie for my death, and the cause thereof to be hidden from you: but séeing that the heauinesse that shoulde be by the knowledge thereof can not reuoke my torment, I pray God that my vnluckinesse be neuer opened vnto you, but kept close and hidden as long as you shal liue, and that not to aduance and hasten the rest of the yeres that you haue yet to liue.

               O My seconde father Galuanes, I am very sorye that my contrarie fortune hathe not permitted nor suffered me to recompence the greate Obligation and band that I am bound in vnto you: for if my father haue gyuen me lyfe, ye

haue saued it, deliuering me from the perill & danger of the sea, wherevnto I was, being as yet in the first houre of my notiuitie and by byrth predestinate, and since that, you hau

               MAdame, a few dayes ago and past, I founde all Amadis harneys with his stutchion layd nigh vnto a fountain, the which men call the fountaine of the plaine field, wherewith I was displeased: the which I the selfe same houre and time bound vnto a trée, leauing it in ye custodie of two Damsels which were in my company, vntill I had bene through out the countrey to séeke and to enquire what was become of him. But I was not so fortunate to find him, nor yet to haue newes of him. Therefore I knowing the merite of so good a knight, whiche neuer had other desire, but to prepare himself to do you seruice, I purposed (seing I could not bring him) to bring vnto you (for a testimonie & witnesse of ye bond that I owe to you and to him) his armure, the which ye shall commaund (if it so please you) to be set in some euident and open place, where euery man may sée them, as well to haue and to heare some newes of him by the straungers that ordinarily come vnto this Court, as to augment the vertue of all those that commōly follow the warres, taking an example by him whome they folow, the which by his high knighthod hath obtained the first place among al those that euer on their backes ware harneys.

Therefore my friendes, let vs stoutly goe forwardes, hauing no regarde of any cruell Gyant and full of bloude, the whiche are of theyr companie. For a man is not the more estéemed bycause of his rude and greate members, but for his good heart and courage. You sée that oftentimes the Hare dothe ouerleape the Oxe, and a Sparow Hauke or a Merline to to beate and to ouercome a Kyte. Our enimies do put their trust in the face of these monsters, hauing no regarde of the wrong that they haue and doe vs, and we truste that God, the which is a doer of right, will giue vs force and strength to ouercome them, through the dexteritie of our persons, and diligence that we shall shewe and doe. Therefore my friends let vs stoutly go forwardes, thinking that euery one of vs euen of himselfe is sufficient and able to fyght and to destroy the moste braue of all their companie: assuring you that

if we this day winne the honor of the battell, besides our renoume and glory that shall compasse the vniuersall worlde, there shall neuer enimie of England lift vp his head with an euill eye, to looke vpon vs.

The Kinges of England vsurpers & tyrants (not only against their subiects, but vpon their neighbors) haue taken in times past without any right, vpon our auncestours a tribute, the which you knowe very well they haue payde oftentimes: and for this cause we are come into this place to defend our libertie, the whiche can not be payde nor recompensed with no treasure: This is your déede, and the right, not of you onely, but of your children, the which vnto this time haue ben holden and reputed by them whome you sée, and are purposed to make you bondmen and slaues. Will you then liue alwayes in this sorte? will you continue the yoke for your successors? are you of a lesse and weaker heart and courage than youre neyghboures? Ah, if we be victorious, they will restore that they haue of ours: I am fast and sure that fortune doth fauor vs: For you see the honest men that are come to ayde and to succour vs. Knowing our good right and title, let vs thruste in among them gentle Knightes, for I sée already that King Lisuard and his companie are in doubt to turne their backes vnto vs, they be (as they say) a

But I sée well inough what it is you make me beléeue and to thinke, that you (being wery of my companie) will driue me away vnder the colour that my cousin is to much youres, abusing your selfe of the seruice that he dothe and heareth vnto you. But yet when you haue lost me, it shall be but a small matter, prouiding that your Amadis (I may well say) be not the worsse entreated: For you knowe well and I also, that the least notice that he shall haue of your trouble, shall be sufficient and inough to cause him to die: so that I maruel what pleasure you take to torment him so oftē, doing for you that is possible to be done for any other Lady aliue. Consider you not that after that Apolidon would that the proofe of the chā
                  ber forbidden was common to all the worlde, that it shoulde not stande with reason, for my cousin kéeping Briolanie to do as other do. Truely I beléeue that neyther she nor you are yet

Therefore I may well assure me, that this newe ielosie procéedeth not of any fault that he hathe made you, the which doth not thinke but to obey you: but his misfortune hath alreadie so ruled him, that to please you, he hath not forgotten himself, but setting by none estate but by you,

hathe entierly disdayned all his linage, and hathe estéemed them as strangers, not knowing them nor no other but you, whom he doth reuerence as a God, and yet you will vtterly lose him. Ah, ah, the dangers and euident perils, in the which he and his haue bene oftentimes for the loue of you, as well against Archelaus, as in this last battell, are now very yll recognised, séeing that in the satisfaction of them, you desire the destruction of the head and principall of my parents.

Certes, to morow I will pray my brother Agreus, and my vncle Galuanes to conduct me into Scotland, the which will do so much for me, as to bring me from your companie that is so vnthankefull. Then she disposed hir to wéepe so greatly, that it séemed she should melte into teares. Alas sayde she, I pray God that the cruelnesse you doe and shewe to your Amadis, may turne to vengeance vpon you to satisfie al his kindred, the which shall not lose so much (losing him) as you alone, and againe, that this may be the greatest misfortune that may happen and chaunce vnto vs.

Alas I opened my selfe vnto you, (hauing none other about me, worthy to vnderstande my heauinesses) to haue counsell and comfort, and you discomforte

me, and intreate me worsse than I haue deserued, reputing me farre otherwise than I am, or shall be so long as my spirite shall sustaine my heart full of bitternesse, the whiche causeth me to presume that no other thing but my euil fortune hath aduaunced and brought me into this kind of intreatie, séeing that you haue taken in yll parte that I told you for the best. And God neuer help me, if I thought in all my life, of that, whereof you blame me and accuse me: for I am so sure of youre cousin, that I will no other thing but to content and please you, and so much there is, that I had rather die, than that any other than I my selfe should haue the honor of the forbidden chamber. Iudge therefore what trouble it shall be to me, if Berolanie that goeth before to proue the thing, obtaine it: This notwithstanding my cousin and friend, I pray you to pardon me, not to prolong (if it be your pleasure) to aduise and counsell me of the thing that as you shall thinke I were best to doe, for your cousin might be too heauie, if he knew the thing that I haue suspected of him.

with me, and to giue hir (so doing) great pleasure. It shall please our king that she be set in some euident and high place, to the intēt she may euidently sée and behold the vengeance that I shall take vpō you, and the vnfortunate ends whereof ye shall dye.

               SYr, I haue all the time of my life desired to kéepe the faith that I owe vnto you, as to my king and naturall Lorde, and shall do, if God be pleased. For beside the oth of fidelitie that I haue and owe vnto you, for ye of your gracious goodnesse haue done me so greate good and pleasures, that if I should not counsell you in that I shall sée to touch your royal maiestie, I should greatly fault against God and man. By the meanes whereof (Syr) after I had very long bethought me vpon this thing that I shall declare vnto you, repented me oftentimes that I had deferred it so long, not for any enuie that I beare to any man (God be my witnesse) but onely for the inconuenience that I sée ready if ye promptly and wisely do not remedie it. Ye know yt at all times there hath bene betwene the realme of France and the realme of England great coutrouersie, bicause the kings your predecessors haue continually pretended a right of soueraintie: and although that for a certaine time this quarell is swaged, so it is very like that the French men (remembring the warres and damages that they haue endured and suffered by your subiects) shall secretly in their hearts and courage take coū
                  sell to reuenge themselues. And Amadis the which is the head and principall of them all, is not come (after my opinion) into this countrey, but to do it, to practise and to winne men, with the which ioined to ye might that he may cause to come, shal procure so much busines, yt so it may chance, it shall not

be easy for you to resist him, and lo there is already apparance thereof. Sir, he of whome I speake vnto you, and they also of his aliance, haue done me so greate honor and pleasure, that I and my children are greatly bound vnto them: And if it were not that ye are my liege Lord, I woulde not for any thing speake against Amadis, I am so much hys friend and seruant: but in things that respect your person, God send me to die sooner, than I should spare any liuing man, no not my owne childe. Ye haue receiued Amadis with so great a number of his parents, and other strangers into your Court, (as ye are a good prince, a liber
                     •
                  ll, and of a noble courage) that at length their company and folowers shal be found greater than yours. Therefore sir, it should be good and well done to prouide before hand, or euer the fyre be through kindled.

Furthermore sir, said Amadis, the gift that I and my companions being present do pray you to graunt vs, is, that it wold please you to giue to my Lorde Galuanes the Ile of Mongase, for the which he shal faithfully he sworne vnto you, and do you homage, & marrie Madasime: this doing Syr, ye shall enrich a poore Prince, vsing and shewing mercy to one of the most fairest gentle women of all the world.

               MY friēd (answereth ye Princesse) ye are greatly to blame, thus to complaine you of my father: for if he haue receiued any goodnesse of you, it was for my loue and fauor only and by my commaundement, and not for his loue: for I alone caused you to come and soiorne in his company. And so it is not in him to recompence you, but in me, whose ye are. It is very true that he cōtinually hath thought the cōtrary, the which doth greatly blame you, that ye answered him so vndiscretely. And againe bicause your departure (being constrained) is to me the most grieuous thing that might chance vnto me, yet I am content to satisfye my selfe, and to obey reason more than delight and pleasure, the which I haue by your presence. Therefore my friend, I will that, that pleaseth you: bycause I am well assured that to what place so euer ye shall resort, your hart yt which is mine, shall remaine with me for a gage of the power that ye haue giuen me ouer you and it: also that my father lées

                  MAdame (said Amadis) the goodnesse that ye do vnto me, is so great, that I estéeme it no lesse, than the redemption of my proper life: for ye know that euery man of vertue ought to haue hys honor in suche estimation, that he should prefer it aboue his owne life. Thus Madame, seing it is of force, ye I to cōserue it must go far from you, do so much yet (if it please you) for me, as during my absence, to send me as oftentimes as ye may newes of you: and continually to kéepe me in your grace and fauor, as he, the which was neuer borne, but to obey and to serue you.

               MY Lordes, bicause men haue wrongfully blamed the Lord Galuanes, Agraies, my selfe, and some other that are here present, to leaue and forsake the kings seruice, as they and I haue appointed, we thought it méete and good, to cause you to vnderstand what the occasion is. I beléeue that thers is not one of this company that doth not perceiue, whether that since our comming into England the authoritie of this prince be augmented or diminished: therefore without consuming of time, in rehersing the seruices that we haue done for him, for the which we had hope to haue had wyth thanks good and great recompence, I wil declare br

                   ingratitude be vseth against vs, & in suche wise, that as mutable & incōstant fortune doth oftentimes turne vpsidowne all things, so he hath changed his conditions eyther by euil counsel that he hath receiued, or by some light occasion that we knowe not. So muche there is, that the Lorde Galuanes required vs to moue vnto him (it is not yet eyght or tenne dayes agoe) the prouision for the mariage of hym and of Madasime: and in so doing, to cause hym to enioy hir landes with this charge, to hold them in fée and homage of hym and of his crowne, the which thyng

we promised him to do. By the meanes wherof, assoone as it was profitable for me to go; I and other of thys company haue bene with him to make this request: but without hauing any regard eyther of vs yt spake, or of him, for whome we labored, the which is (as euery man doth know) the king of Scotlands brother, a wise and asmuch as is possible a hardy knight, the which euen of late against king Cildadan hath not spared his life, but hath done his dutie as much as any that came thither: he hath refused vs, and burdened vs with iniurie, nothing conuenient nor méete for such a king.

But yet bycause this leaue (as I do thinke) touched not me only, nor those that he spake vnto, but to all other the whyche are not his vassalles: I thought it méete to cause you to vnderstande the matter, to the intent ye might thinke vpon the thinges that were to come.

               MY lords, it is not yet lōg ago since I knew the king, and for the little knowledge yt I haue had of him, I neuer saw a wiser, vertuouser, or a more temperate Prince than he in al affaires: And therfore I am in doubt that ye communicatiō which he hath had with Amadis and his Lordes that wer present, came not of his own fansie, but yt he was induced to do it by som enuious & euil person, that hath persuaded

him to be miscontent with them. And bycause I haue séene within these nyne or tenne dayes Gandandel and Broquadan speake oftentimes vnto him, and that he listened vnto them more than to any other, I doubt that these are they that haue

You sayde vnto me that I should go and search in the world who knowe me better than you, giuing me sufficiently inough to vnderstand the little enuie that doth let you that I dwell no more in your Court. But séeing it hath so pleased you to cō
                  maund me, it is reason that I obey you, not that I will depart from you as from my souereine, for I was neuer your vassall, nor of no other Prince, but of God only: but I take my leaue of you, as of him that hath done me much good and honor, vnto whom I beare my loue, and a desire to serue.
            
            
               Lord Quedragants Oration to King Lisuard, leauing his seruice. In the selfe same Chapter.
               SYr, I had neuer dwelt in your Court but at the request of Amadis, willing and desiring to be his friend for euer, and

séeing that by his occasion I was yours, by like reason I depart from you for euer: considering that my little and small seruices shall haue but little hope, séeing that his great seruices are so euill recognised and rewarded, hauing no remē
                  braunce of the Obligation wherewith you are bounde vnto him, that deliuered you from the hands of Mandafabul, nor of the victorie that you wonne and obtained vpon King Cildadan by his and his parents bloude. I could put you in remē
                  brance of the good turne that he did you, when he deliuered you and your daughter Oriane (as I oftentimes haue heard it spoken) from the hands of Archalaus, and not long since my Ladie Leonor, the which Famongomad, and Basigant his sonne Giants most cruell of all the world, held as prisoner to haue slaine hir: thus the ingratitude that you do now vse against him, is so great, that it depriueth you of all the knowledge of truth. And therefore he should no lesse estéeme this leaue so sone giuen, than the retribution of his seruices so well accorded and rewarded. And as for me, I am purposed to follow him, and to go and depart from your Court.

               MY Lord, you knowe my affaires, and that of my selfe I being wholy vnder and subiecte to the will of an other, can doe nothing. For the which I suffer anguishes and paynes most straunge, the which are the cause that I can not folowe you, whereof I am ashamed, so great a desire I haue to knowledge the goodnesse and the honor that you (being in in your companie) haue done for me, praying you most humbly at this present, to hold and to haue me excused.

               I Do maruel that you are so bold and presumptuous to persuade me, to leaue vnto you the rule not only of my house, but of al this kingdome, knowing that you are not sufficient to do it. Think you that the Princes & Lords of this Monarchie will obey you, knowing the place from whence you are descended? And if you thinke and beléeue to playe the good husbands, willing to enriche me by sparing of money, thinke you that I may better bestowe it, than to giue it to Gentlemen and Knights that are in my seruice? seing that a Prince can not name himselfe a King, except he haue men at his cō
                  maundement. And if before time I shewed my selfe liberall to those which at your instance I haue chased away, by those I was maintained, famed and redoubted: and therefore content you with that that you haue done, without any more disguising of thinges, or else I will shew you that it displeaseth me.

               SYr, I am not yet your subiecte nor your liege man, but yet in recognising the nurture that I haue learned in youre Court, I am bound to saue your maiesties honor. Therfore syr, I aduertise you, that three dayes since I fortuned to be in a place, where I perceiued that Broquadan and Gandandel did not only conspire (but alreadie haue committed againste God and you) the most greatest treson that may be thought. It is sure and certain, that they do purpose to counsell and to persuade you to put Madasime and these Damsels to death: and as touching the rest, syr, I trust that all their mischieuousnesse or tenne dayes be past shall be disclosed. And to set those villaynes in authoritie, you haue caste awaye not long

since, my Lord Amadis, and many other good Knightes out of your companie. I am no more purposed to remaine here, and I take my leaue of you to go and to séeke my vncle Angriote, whome (if God be pleased) you shall sée shortly héere againe, and me with him, purposed with force of armes to open vnto those two traytors their vniust and false conspiracie.

And that you and your children (if need were) would sustaine this counsel vnto death. You haue perceiued what Ymosil and his companions haue saide vnto me, the which I finde to be good and iust, therefore it is time that you aduise you of the thing that you haue to do. For by the faith that I owe vnto God, I will licence none of my other Knights to fight with them, and if you prouide not for this, you shall be punished, and the Damselles deliuered.

                   those two villaynes Broquadan and Gandandell, the which are in your Court, to appeare presently, vnto whome I will declare the treason that they haue vsed against you. Syr, these euill men of whome I speake to you, not hauing any consideration nor feare of God or of man, haue falsly accused my Lord Amadis and other, of a thing that they neuer in all their liues thought on, by the meanes whereof I dare well say, you haue remoued farre from you, the best Knightes that euer entred into Englande: therefore if these traytors dare

But the gallant knoweth well that I am olde and broken, as much for the number of my olde yeares, as of the insinite woundes the which I haue receiued throughout all the parts of my body, in the warres of your predecessors.

               COme hither, you haue so oftentimes recited and told me, that Amadis and his, had purposed to betraye me, and to

vsurpe vpon me the countrie of England, and yet when you should méete, you excused your selues from fighting, and sent your children to the play, that could do nothing therwithall: yet God is iust, and by as much as I owe him and am bound vnto him, it was euil spoken of you, nor I would neuer haue estéemed you to be such maner of men as you be.
            
            
               The Oration of King Arban of Norgales to King Lisuarde, inducing him to call Amadis againe to his Court. In the .3. booke the .1. Chaper.
               SYr, I would thinke it good (or euer you did this thing) that you shoulde haue the aduice of the noble men of your countrie: for you knowe that Amadis and they of his kindred are wonderful good Knights, and very mightie through the friendes that they haue. Furthermore, there is not he that knoweth not howe falsly they haue bene accused before your maiestie, whereof the victorie that Angriote and Sarquelles haue obtained within these few dayes that be past against the accusers, hath giuen good witnesse, and if the right had not bene on their side, yet bicause they are good and valiant Knyghts, they shoulde not haue bene so easily dispatched of Candandelles children, nor of Amadis: the whiche thing dothe sufficiently make vs to vnderstande and beleeue, that the Lorde mayntained them in their iustification and ryght. And therefore syr, it should be best (as I doe suppose and thinke) if it woulde so please you, to forget the euill that you bears them, and to call them agayne to your seruice, séeing that it shall not be greatly approued nor allowed, that a Prince should make war against those, that he may easily and with his honor call againe to his amitie & seruice, considering that doing the contrarie, is oftentimes losse of men, extreme expenses, and diminishing of authoritie, a thing that shortly after causeth the Lords and neighbors therabouts, to desire and to make newe enterprises, to get them out of subiection,

and to enter into a more libertie than they had before. And therefore a sage and a wise Prince ought at no time (if it be possible) to giue occasion to his vassalles to go and depart frō the feare and reuerence that they owe vnto him: but muste proue and assaye by all meanes and wayes to rule them, as the good shepeheard by temperate discretion dothe with his shéepe, winning their hearts and wils more by faithful loue, than by rigour and tyrannie. Therefore syr, it is necessarie to quench the fire alreadie kindled, before it be throughly set a fire. For oftentimes after the fault be knowne, the remedie is to farre gone. Amadis is so humble and so much yours, that if you would send to reuoke him, you shal easily recouer him with those that haue followed him, of the whiche you may be better serued than euer you were.

               MY Lords, I am sent hither vnto you, from the most puissant and mightie King Lisuard my soueraine Lord, in whose name I defie you, and all your parentes, friendes or aliance, and from him I declare vnto you, that if euer he find you in England, or in the Isle of Mongase, he will cause you to be destroyed, and entreated as his mortall enimie. Therefore kéepe your selues from henceforth if you may or can, for he hath enterprised to inuade you, and vtterly (if he may find the meane and wayes) to destroy you.

And as touching this, that he purchaseth my enmitie, assure him that he shall haue it, so that he shall forget the thing that I and mine haue done in his defence. And yet say vnto him, that although I alone haue conquered the Ile of Mongase, that I will neuer set my foote to cause him to léese it, nor in place where I maye anoy and trouble the Quéene for the honor of hir.

By the meanes whereof, I awhyle after was restored to all my goodes, the whiche I will holde of you euen as they were yours, and my selfe also for euer, to whome at that time and houre ye did so great honor, as to come and refresh you in this my great Rosier, where afterwards you and I deuising together among my pleasant orcha

Ye knowe the honor that the Emperoure doth me, and the embassade that he newly hath sent vnto me, desiring me to giue him my daughter Oriane to be his wife. And ye shall beléeue me, I thinke that the Lord in this thing dothe muche for hir and me: for he is at this present the most mightie and redoubted Prince of all chi

impossible to prouide better for hir, than she shall be, being the wife of suche an Emperoure: and thus Leonor shall remaine after me sole Lady of my landes and countries, the which otherwise might be deuided and a thing very hurtful. But yet I am purposed to do nothing without the aduice of the Lords and knights of my Court, and specially yours, the which I pray you (by the amitie that ye haue alwayes borne me) to tell me freely and frankly, and without any dissimulation.

                   Chapter.
               SYr, ye say, that marying my Lady Oriane to the Emperoure, ye shall prouide so well for hir, that it should be impossible to prouide better. The whiche thing séemeth to me cleane contrary, for she being your principall heire, and to send hir into a farre countrey to cause hir to leese hir realme, the which is hirs already, ye shall make hir poore, without men, and in subiection to a people not agreing with the maners and conditions of this countrie. And if it séeme to you, that she to be the Emperours wife, & to beare the name of an Empresse shall be in more authoritie in time to come, by God Syr ye do abuse your selfe, and here is the reason therof. Suppose that it may chaunce hir to haue male children by the Emperoure hir husband, if she remaine widow, the first thing that hir sonne shall do vnto hir, shall be to cause hir retire and to haue the rule of the Empire alone, and if he marrie, it will be worse, for the new princesse will be inferior to none. And therefore it is most sure, that my Lady your daughter shall fall into a thousand inconueniences and extreme sorowes, hauing forsaken this countrey, (the which certenly is hir natiue land) to liue in a straunge countrie, from hir parents, subiects and seruants. And as conce

                  ning

ye say, that thorough his fame you shall be succoured, feared, and redoubted: truly sir, ye haue (thanks be to God) so many friendes and knightes at your commaundement, that without the ayde of the Romaines, ye may easely if ye think it good, extend your limits: and I beléeue that in the steade to haue any support, they shall rather assay to bring you to ruine, and to destroy you, than (as ye estéeme) to ayde and succour you, for they will haue no egal vnto them, nor none greater nor aboue them. And furthermore this is certaine, that they would demaund nothing more, than to haue an occasion to set you in their Chronicles, to your confusion, and their glory, vnder the shadow of some little fauor that they haue borne you, the which thing should be the greatest euill that might happen to you and yours. And also Syr, what reason should it be, to put my Lady Oriane your daughter and principall inheriter so farre from you, to aduantage so much the princesse Leonor, the whiche is the yonger: by my soule, for a righteous king, and that is taken throughout all the world for an author of iustice, ye shall make peraduenture the greatest wound in your renoume yt euer did prince or mightie king. And God neuer giue not only to you the will, so farre out of reason, but also to the poorest knight of your court, beséeching you sir most humbly, to beléeue, that I would not haue bin so foolish hardy to declare vnto you so freely the thing that I thought good, if ye had not expressely commaunded me: and also bicause I am minded and apointed to kéepe vnto you (all my life) the fidelitie that I haue promised, as he that doth feele him bound vnto you, for the goodnesse and fauor that ye haue done for me.

And therefore my Lord Florestan. I pray you in the name of God, to prepare your selfe to dissuade him of his fantasie, or else by my faith, this thing shall be vnto him a greate charge in conscience, and to me the most strange misfortune into the which any poore damsell disherited and forsaken of God and man might fall.

               MAdame, ye shall do me great iniurie, if ye haue me not in that estimation, that I am entirely yours, and ready to obey and to serue you vntill death: but to speake to the king your father, as ye pray me, is impossible for me to do: for ye know the enmitie that he beareth me, in despite of my Lord Amadis, forgetting all the great seruices that he, and all they of his linage haue done him in times past, and if he haue receiued any by me, he ought not to thanke me, seing that I did it not for his loue, but by his commaundement that hath all power vpon me, and vnto whome I may not, nor I ought not to saye against: the whiche was the cause that I of late was in the warre of the seuen knightes, not to ayde those of England, but only to conserue and kepe the right that ye haue there, as she y• one day shall be, if it please God, Lady

haue told me and other my friendes, to assay and to finde remedie in your affaires, and I trust they wil in such sort prouide for you, that ye shall haue an occasion to content you, assuring you, that I will tarie in no place, til that I be in the inclosed Ile, where I shall find the Prince Agraies, the which hath (as ye know) a great desire to do you seruice, & also for the loue of Mabile his sister. There we shall aduise vs togyther of the thing that we must take vpon vs, without sparing of any thing that is in our puissance and power.

Therefore consider with your selfe, that if he had done on your part as ye apoint to do to my Lady Oriane, ye had not bene now so great & so mightie a Lord as ye are. Wherfore will ye chase hir away, to cal my niece Leonor into hir place, cōsidering that (as I beléeue) she neuer offended you? And if it séeme vnto you, ye marying hir to the

Emperour Patin, ye shal make hir a great Princesse, & very wel to prouide for hir: truely syr, you are far from your accompt, for you know yt hauing childrē togither, if she outliue ye Emperor, she shal remain but ye simple dowager of Rome, in place to be after you Lady and Queene of this Realme: & furthermore, do you estéem that your subiects wil hardly cō

whome he hath fought. And if it please you syr to graunt me the thing that I desire of you, you shall sende to me by this Damsell and to all my company, but especially to the knight of Gréece a safe conducte, that he receiue no outrageousnesse nor iniurie, if it be not of those against whom he shall fight, & if he ouercome the first, let the second, the third, & the fourth come, and all they that will proue him one after an other.

And it seemeth that you haue a certaine enuie and will to iniurie and prouoke fortune against you, and to vnbinde misfortune that hath bene so long bound at your gate: haue you forgotten the graces that the Lord

Pardon me syr: for the faith and fidelitie that I beare you, doth bolden me to saye thus vnto you: for you knowe howe that these worldly things are transitorie and perillous, and that the glory & renoume that men get by long trauell in this life, is oftētimes

put out and buried through litle and light occasiō, if fortune do disfauor the person, so that if there rest any help in ye place of prayse, he shal be blamed only, that could not entertaine & kéepe the good fortune wherein he was before.

come shall heare it spoken, and so, whereas you are renoumed throughout all the worlde to be a Prince benigne & mercifull, ye shall be called vnpitifull, and more cruell than any other may be: pardon me sir, the heauinesse that presseth me, doth constrayne me to say all that I thinke: and if ye sée that I speake vnto you to irreuerently, take of my indiscretion what vengeance it shall please you: for ye cannot gyue me so great payne and torment as that is, the whiche I see is prepared for me, depriuing me of your presence.
            
            
               The Earle of Argamont, Oration to king Lisuard, intending (as before) to turne him from the foresaid mariage. In the 3. booke the .17. Chapter.
               MY Lord, I would hold my selfe but too fortunate, if I had not an occasion to tell you that reason dothe binde me, knowing you to be a wise and a vertuous Prince, easily to discerne the good with the euill: neuerthelesse, the sorow that my Ladie your daughter hath made vnt
                     •
                   me not long since, hath constrained me to put you in remembrance of the thing that I at other times haue tolde you of hir, and I praye you as muche as I may possible (or euer she depart far from you) to thinke ripely and without affection vpon it. For notwithstanding, a wise man doth not commonly make a fault gouerning himselfe by reason, yet when he presumeth so much of himself, that he will haue no counsell but of his own head, he falleth often in more daunger than doth the lesse aduised, the experience whereof hath ben séene at other times in many Princes. My Lorde, you sée the extremitie in the whiche my Ladie Oriane is, and if you thinke well vpon it, you shall easily iudge the inconuenience that maye fall to hir person through too great desperation, whereof within a while after you shall be sorie all the dayes of your life. And besides all this, you may be blamed, not onely of straungers, but of your own subiects, and hereafter be odious vnto them, wherof

of there may come and arise many chauces and misfortunes. Therefore beléeue their counsell, that desire your profite and the honor of your Realme, for so doing, you can not chaunce amisse: and although it should chaunce otherwise, yet you should be excused, and they bounde to finde remedie. And furthermore you know well, that the fault which is done by coū
                  sell, can not be otherwise named, but a fault wisely made. Sée nowe my Lord why and wherefore I desired you verie humbly, (vsing fatherly pitie) to con
                     •
                  ent these Ambassadours by some other meane, than with the price of your daughters bloude.
            
            
               The Oration of the Damsell Grasinde to King Lisuard, declaring vnto him the crueltie that he beareth vnto his daughter Oriane, and the damsels of his Court, minding to marrie hir to the Emperour. In the .3. boke the .17. Chapter.
               SYr, hitherto you haue bene taken for the moste estéemed Prince of all Christendome, a louer of honor, and of all vertue, and aboue, a all protector of Ladies and Damsels, doing and shewing them so great goodnesse and graces, that they haue had great occasion to prayse you more than any other that liueth: and now losing their hope that they had in you, they sée themselues reiected from your great goodnesse, knowing how you intreate my Lady Oriane your daughter, disinheriting hir of the goods, that of right after you should pertaine vnto hir: wherof they maruel greatly, considering howe it hathe bene possible that your benigne nature might so lightly be turned into so great crueltie, as that nowe they neuer hope to haue any thing of you, that shal be to their aduantage and comfort, vsing such maner of fashions and doings towards hir, vnto whom pitie and fatherly loue, besides the title and the name of a King, whereby you ought to be a mayntainer of right (doing iustice to eache one) hath bounde you. And beleue me syr, that it may happen worsse vnto you, as wel for the il ensample that you giue the people, as for the

abundance of wéepings and hard lamentations of my Lady Oriane, the which are before God, requiring vengeance, and so that if you take not héede, the end of your raigne shall not ensue and folow the beginning therof, in the which you haue prospered as muche, as any other King or Prince that we know. Syr, I will say no more vnto you, for I will go after these two Knights that haue taried very long for me.
            
            
               Amadis Oration to those of the closed Isle, shewing them the great wrong that King Lisuarde did to his daughter, willing to marrie hir against hir will, with other Princesses and Ladies of his countrie, prouoking them to reuenge this wrong and iniurie. In the .3. booke the .17 Chap.
               AS farre forth as I sée, the things are much chaunged in England, since we went and departed from thence, and the King hathe an other manner of fantasie-than he had in times past: for I haue seene him more prompt and ready to help & to succor Ladies, thā to his own affaires: And I now bee maruell what moueth him, thus so fare with my Ladye Oriane, seing there was neuer childe more obedient to father as she continually hath shewed hir self. And now as Angriot and Brun
                        •
                     o do recite & shew, he hath against hir will, and all the Knights of England, ioyned hir to him whome in all the world she hateth aboue all other, whereof I haue such pitie, that if you wil beleeue me, and help, we shal succor and ayde hir, and set hir at libertie. But I will take nothing in hande without you al: ye ought to remember the othe that Quéene Brisina caused you to make in the Citie of London. We all did sweare not to suffer any wrong at any tyme to be done to anye Ladie or Damsell that required vs: nowe then shall we suffer hir to be thus yll intreated and captiue, of whome at other tymes we haue receyued so greate honour and fauour? Shall the Damselles of hir companie be taken perforce, and banished for euermore oute of theyr owne countrey? by my God, if we shoulde suffer it,

we were worthy to receiue blame, without hauing of any meane or excuse to saue vs, and we shall fall in the reputation of the increased number of the Knightes vnfortunate. Therefore aduise you togither what you will that shall be done, for as touching me, I am well purposed to deferre and leaue off a voiage that I had taken in hand, as I haue by Gidalin certified and told not long since my cousin Agraies, Florestan and other. And with these shippes that I haue founde in this Hauē, to prepare me to breake the enterprise of king Lisuard, and to saue these poore Damsels, among whome I know not a more sorowfull, except my Ladie Oriane, thā 
                  Olinda, whom the King (vsing his new cruelnesse) will marrie with all constraint and violence to Salust Quide, the whiche hath demaunded and required hir. But I would faine know by what authoritie he will nowe thus intreate those which are not his subiects, nor of his countries: specially my cousin Mabile, whom the King hir father sent into Englande, not to be confederate at Rome, but only to dwell with the Quéene, and to kéepe Oriane companie, the which loued hir so, as two yong Princesses might beare familiar amitie togither: and I maruell that all his countrie be not alreadie reuolted and turned against him, or at the least wise, that no knight hath set him selfe forth by armes to say against & to resist this his foolish fātasie: but there is none as yet that hath prepared to do it. Therfore my friends I pray you al, that folowing the auncient custome, which hath ben diligently obserued amōg the wandering Knights, to take héede that no man doe them so great wrong, nor intreate them so euill. Doing this, we shal get honor & prayse more than euer we gat before, without the which, in what sort soeuer it be, we may be blamed. Tell me therefore what you think herein, that we folowing the conclusion which we shall take, may set an order to execute the same.
            
            
               Agraies Oration to his cōpanions, wherwith he exhorteth them to cleaue to Amadis mynd & conclusion. In the .3. b. 17. cha.
               
                  I Cannot tell who he should be that would slacke so gentle an enterprise, seing that or euer ye my Lord and cousin arriued and came hither, we were gathered togither in thys place to prouide for the same, and now that we fynde you so conformable to our willes, I am sure that there is none of vs that thinketh any other thing, but that fortune doth call vs to performe it and end it, promising vs certen victorie, being pensife & sory, for the fauor that she hath borne thus lōg to king Lisuard, the which at this present in no wise doth know himselfe: and that it is so, what hath he to do to sende my sister against hir will into a straunge countrey? hath the king my father giuen hir vnto him, to do his pleasure with hir? ye knowe that a little after our departing out of Englande, I sent to the Quéene for hir, but she refused me that, sending me word by Gandales, that she would sée hir intreated & nourished as hir proper person: Is this the good intreating that she hath kept for hir, at the last to destroy hir? hath Mabile no nother place to conuey hir selfe vnto, but to the Emperours house? Is not the Realme of Scotland rich ynough to nourish and to bring hir vp? by God, this manner of doing of king Lisuard is so vnfortunable and so farre out of reason, that I had rather die a hūdreth fold (if it were possible) than not to be reuenged: and already I haue sent to my father to prouide therefore. In the meane while I pray you all my Lords to ayde me, and you specially whome this iniurie doth touch in a manner as well as me, being done, not only to my sister your cousin, and nigh parente, but to Olinda and other, of whome folowing the thing that we haue promised and sworne (as my Lorde Amadis hath saide) we ought to be the protectors and defenders.
            
            
               The Oration of Grasind to those of the enclosed Ile, praising their enterprise going to succoure Oriane and hir damsels. In the .3. booke and .17. Chapter.
               
                  BY my God, your enterprise is high, and worthy of very greate laude and prayse, considering that besides the good that ye do to them that ye go to help and succcoure, ye shall ensue and follow the other good knights (the whiche are of this countrie or strangers) so that from hencefoorth men shal not suffer folowing you, that any man should do wrong to any Lady or to any other damsell. And therefore ye shal so indet them, that both they and these that be, and that shal come a hundred yeares and mo hereafter, shall thanke you.
            
            
               King Lisuards Oration to my Lady Oriane his daughter, exhorting hir to allow the mariage to be good, that he hathe vndertaken to make of hir with the Emperoure. In the 3. booke the .18. Chapter.
               MY welbeloued, ye haue alwayes shewed your selfe obedient to my will, without any contradiction, and will ye not continue still, as reason willeth you? ye melancoly your selfe (as farre foorth as I see) for the mariage that I haue found out for you, whereof I do greatly maruell. Estéeme you that I would once thinke to do any thing that shoulde not turne to your honoure and profite? Thinke you that I am of so euill a nature towardes you? I sweare vnto you by my faith, that the amitie that I beare you, is so certein and sure, that I haue no lesse heauinesse for your departing from hence, than 
                     •
                  e haue. But ye know that it should be impossible to prouide for you so well as vnto my selfe: Therfore I pray you, vsing your accustomable wisedom, to make better cheere, and to reioice your selfe of the goodnesse that is chanced vnto, being the wife of the greatest prince of all the world. And if ye do that ye shall (besides that ye shall be esteemed) receiue and comfort your father, the which is as heauy of your anoyance, as nothing more.
            
            
               The answer of Oriane to king Lisuard hir father, declaring vnto him the great wrōg that he doth hir, to marrie hir against hir will. In the .3. booke the .17. Chapter.
               
                  MY Lord, ye haue thē as farre foorth as I sée, resolued the mariage of me and the Emperoure: It may be that ye haue made one of the greatest faults, that any Prince can do: for first of all I will neuer loue the husband that ye gyue me, and I am well assured and certaine (as I haue declared vnto you not long since) that Rome shall neuer sée me, willing rather to fall into the mercie of fishes, than to dwell in a place wherevnto I haue no desire or affection. Now I cannot thinke what hath induced you; or perswaded you to do this, but the loue that ye beare to my sister, and the desire that ye haue to leaue hir your sole heyre, and me, the moste miserable damsell of all the world, but God that is iust wyll not suffer that your intention so vnreasonable shall come to effect, but rather shal send death vnto me, if it so please him.
            
            
               Amadis Oration to his companions, admonishing them to take good courage to succoure in so great neede, so many noble damsels. In the selfe same Chapter.
               MY companions and friends, were it not for the assurāce that I haue of the vertue and magnanimitie that is in you all, I without doubt would refraine to put in aduenture the battell that we sée is ready, if we would take it in hande. But yet I knowing you to be such as ye are indéede and also the iust occasion for the which we are entred and haue taken the sea, I thinke that we shuld not delay it, but to cast away all feare, to deliuer frō captiuitie so many desolate damsels, the whiche call vnto vs to succoure and to help them, by the only obligation and band that we haue to defend their libertie. Therefore I beséech you let vs so liuely set vpon these shippes, & in such sort, y• setting these ladies out of danger, their cōductors shal neuer bring newes to their Emperour.

                  ALas, fortune doth now shew that she will go not only to the ruine and destruction of vs miserable captiues, but of the Emperoure, and of al his Empire. Ah, ah, poore prince, euill lucke hath méetely well runned vpon thee: Alas, what losse, and what heauinesse shall they haue for euer, that loued thée, when they shall know thy sodein end: I cannot tell how thy master may support it and beare it: but I beléeue that he shal not so soone heare the newes, but that he shal die throgh great anger (hauing a good cause) for the losse at once of so many great vessels, and good men: and specially for you my Lady (

               An exhortation of Mabile to Queene Sardamire, to dispose hir to learne pacience in hir aduersitie, nor to be astonied at fortunes inconstancie. In the .4. booke the .1. Chapter.
               IN good faith my Lady, it becommeth (as I estéeme) a princesse so wise, as ye haue bene alwayes reputed, to fall into suche extremitie: for the vertue of a wise person cannot be knowen, but when tribulation commeth sodeinly vpō him. And further more, you that doe beare the title of a Queene, ought by good reason to be more constant than a simple damsell should be, or any other person vnworthy of the place and kingdome that ye possesse. Do ye not know that fortune is mutable, and that she will take away hir fauor from whom it pleaseth hir, and call it agayne when it seemeth good vnto hir? So then, séeing that the Emperoures armie is defeated, and your selfe at this tyme to be in the handes of the knightes of the inclosed Iland, it followeth well, that ye

should take this chaunce paciently, and beare it wisely, when that ye cannot amend it: be you also assured that ye are in the power of those, that shall do you all the honour, seruice, and good intreating that they may deuise. And if the Prince Salust be deade, what remedie? ye cannot call him agayne with your wéeping, these be the common turnes and chaunces of warre, to those that séeke thē. And therfore madame, if it so please you, be no more heauy, but vsing your accustomed prudencie and wisedome, take the things so, as they may chance and come.

                     •
                  he hath a iust occasion to be heauie, for the inconuenience that she is fallen in, and that it may please hir to cōsent & to beare with hir in hir affection. The .4. booke the .1. Chapter.

                  sy to him that is in ioy, to comfort (as ye do) the person that is ouerwhelmed with displeasure. Neuerthelesse if ye selfe the heauinesse that presseth me, ye would peraduenture lament me more than ye do: yet I knowe that ye say the truth, and that it is impossible for me, so at this time to commaund and to rule my selfe, to beléeue your counsell. Therefore I pray you for the honor of God, that excusing my imperfections, ye will ayde me your selfe, and all these other Ladies also, to lament my euill houre and mischaunce irrecuparable.
            
            
               The replicatiō of Mabile to Queene Sardamire, declaring vnto hir, that to be heauie for the thing that is happened, is not the meane to help it. In the .4. booke the .1. Chapter.
               MAdame (sayd Mabile) if ye for our heauinesse of the thing that ye pray vs for, might be the better, I sweare vnto you by my faith, that there is not she in this company (as I thinke) but would with good heart employ hir selfe: but ye know that when the thing is d
                     •
                  ne, the counsell is taken:

thus ye may know, that of necessitie ye must make an ende of your wepings, be it with the time, or rather by your prudencie and wisedome.
            
            
               Amadis Oration to his companions, declaring vnto them the thing that he had vnderstood by Oriane, whiche tendth to this, that king Lisuard had changed the mind which he had to marry hir to the Emperoure, furthermore praying him to prepare him selfe to succoure hir in hir great trouble. In the .4. booke the .3. Chapter.
               MY Lords, yesterday my Lady Oriane sēt vnto me, praying me that we should fynd some meanes to restore hir to the good grace and fauour of the king hir father, and to deliuer him (if it were possible) of the fantasie that he hathe to marrie hir to the prince of the worlde, to whom she beareth little amitie or loue: for otherwyse death shal be to hir more agreeable. And therefore I thought it good (after that I had spoken with some of this compan
                     •
                   particularly) to vnderstand generally of you al, what ye thinke: for séeing that we haue bene companions to set hir at libertie, it is very reasonable we should be to maintein hir: but first or euer we enter any further into this matter, I pray you to haue before your eyes, that euen now your renoume is so knowen thoroughout all the world, bicause of the high chiualries that ye haue done, that there is this day no King, Prince, nor Knight, of whome ye are not fear

Whereof the woundes that ye haue in diuers parts (the markes and witnesses of your noble actes) may giue suche faith and testimonie, that fortune hirselfe is bound vnto you: whereof she willing to

recompence you, hath put into your hands and g

                  uen you this glorious victorie that we haue had ouer the two greatest Princes of christendome. Not that I will speake of the destruction of their people only, being of little merite towards vs, but for the succour that ye haue shewed to the most wise, gentle and vertuous Lady of the earth, the which was at the point (most wrongfully) to suffer a worse entreatment, than may be thought. And thus ye haue done right great & agreable seruice vnto God, executing the thing, to the which ye ar

                   expressely called, that is, to suc

And if the Emperour and king Lisuard, if it so like them, will be angrie & wroth, seing that the right is ours, God y• which is iust, will be with vs also: and in such sort, that if they of themselues know not what is reason, and beléeue by theyr power to ouercome our force & strength, I promise my selfe & hope well, that we may so resist thē, that as lōg as ye world shal be a world & continue, there shal be a memorie and a remembrāce therof.

                  ust occasion they enterprised against the Emperoure, and that it is needefull in all sweetnesse to aduertise king Lisuard, least he shoulde be miscontent. In the .4. booke the .3. Chapter.
               
                  MY Lord Amadis, it is very certeine, that the enterprise that hath bin made vpon the Emperoure was not for any enmitie that we bare him: but only to kéepe our fayth, as al good knights should, to sustayne and defend the wrongfully afflicted, and specally all good Ladies, of the whiche all we should be protectors. And therefore I am thus minded, first or euer we begin this warre, that we send to king Lisuard and to cause him to vnderstand the occasion that moued vs to assayl
                     •
                   and inuade the Romaines, and as quietly as may be, if he be miscontent, to pacifie him: declaring vnto him with all graciousnesse, the iniurie and wrong that he did to my Lady his daughter, disheriting hir vnder the coloure to marrie hir with a strange Prince, the which thing is not agreable vnto God, nor to none of his subiects, and therfore if it be his good pleasure, to receiue hir to his grace and fauor, and to forget ye enuie (if he heare hir any) offering vnder this condition to restore hir vnto hym, and no otherwise. And if he refuse it, and disdaine the duetie that we put oure selues in, that then we declare resolutely vnto him, that we doubt him not, and that we if he make warre vpon vs, be ready to defend vs. In the meane while, it is necessarie that we fortifie vs with all things tha

                     •
                  o a thing of such importance as this is: at least way if he purpose to inuade vs, that he find vs not vnprouided: although he will be (as my mind giueth me) more ready to peace, than to any other thing: but yet that should not cause vs t

And although that at this present I haue not the meane to recognise nother to them, nor to you, how muche I am bound to you, yet I hope with the time by all meanes to endeuer me thereto: And in the meane while ye shall not (if it please you) he miscontent, that I familiarly do cause you to perceiue the gréeues that I suffer. And to begin, I pray you, that ye (leauing) off the wrong that my father hath done you) will to your power make meanes to haue peace betwene my cousin and him: for I doubt not (seing the auncient and old hatred that they haue together, & the occasion that ye all haue to will him little fauor) but that full honestly the things begon shall come to no other end, than to a great ruine of the one part and other, if it be not through the resistance that ye may do, vsing in this thing your wisedome and good counsell. Of the which thing I pray you againe, as well to auoide such inconuenience, as not to make me suspect to straunge nations, the whiche may hereafter doubt of my innocencie, and bespot my good renoume, the which is to me of such consequence, as ye may iudge and estéeme.

And as touching that you haue to cause me to forget ye iniurie that the King your father hath dnoe to me, and not only to me alone, but to all my parents and friends, he you assured Madame, that the wounde is so great, that it will bléede as long as I shall liue, knowing the ingratitude that he hath vsed towards vs, denying my Lord Amadis, me, and many other good Knights, the request that we made vnto him, to giue my vncle Galuanes the Isle of Mongase, the which had deserued it and better: cōsidering also that it was conquered by the vertue and noble actes of him, that prayed him: but yet for the honor of you, I am content to diss

And to shewe you that I will wholly prepare me to please you, I promise you Madame, to assay to do to my power, the thing that you desire of me: but it were not reasonable that it shoulde be done so promptly, for if I should nowe begin in the word and communication, the thinges being thus disposed to warre in place to encourage so many good Knightes as be in this Isle, I shoulde put the most part of them, (hearing me speake of peace) in feare, presuming that I (it might be so) helde suche a purpose, as though I were the first that were afearde. Also I should doe two euils togither, yt which after this might turne to the losse of vs all, and to me alone great dishonor. But I hauing your

fathers answere, shall pray my companions to do as ye haue deuised and counselled: in the mean while, you should (as I do thinke) be heauie as little as you may, and take the time and fortune most paciently, & as constantly as you may possible.

               MAdame, I am maruellously displeasant, that I had no better oportunitie to do you in this place the honor and the seruice, that you merite and deserue: but the time so euil to that purpose, doth take away the occasion, therefore I excusing my selfe, do pray you not to take or impute a fault of a good will. For in times past you haue bounde me vnto you, that there shall be no daye of all my life, but I shall féele me your debter, what seruice soeuer I may doe for you. And bycause it is nowe long agoe since you did departe from your countrie, it may be that the long abyding here in this countrie hath wrought you some displeasure, I would therefore very greatly desire to knowe your deliberation and mynde, that I might (if it were possible) haue some meane to obey you in the thing that should please you to commaunde me.

And the good intreating that you had (as you say) in my countrie (if any such was shewed you) is nowe but recompensed: but to put you out of paine, I will shewe you what I thinke: I sée many good Knightes assembled for to helpe this Princesse,

the which altogither for the amitie and good estimation that they beare you, haue put their hope and conduct vpon you,

                  o that it shall be impossible for you to put them from you without your great blame. And seing that suche a charge is wholly set and layde vpon you, ye must trauell to send on euery side to recouer people to help you, so that the honour of so greate an enterprise may remayne with you, and by the meanes and help of your friends be yours, of the which I esteeme my selfe the firste. And for this cause, I intende to morow to send maister Elizabet into the parts of Rome, to gather as many men as he can, as well of my owne subiects as other, and as shortly as he may to shippe them, and to cō

Nor I tell you not this without a cause, ye haue borne & haue had (following ye nature of mothers) an heauinesse and a sorow too much apparant, for the absence of your daughter, and for all that I estéeme my selfe fortunate for the hope the which I haue that it may be soone forgotten. But the poyson is found in the tayle, and such, that the thing which is nowe happened, toucheth me so néere, that I shall neuer be in rest till I be satisfied, euen as I desire. The Romanes which cō

And forasmuch as the renoume shall flye throughout al the world, it is now very requisite & méete that ye dissemble, vsing more wisedome than passion: doing this, ye shall be greatly estéemed, our enimies astonyed, and I greatly contented with you: trusting in suche sort to prouide, that your honor and mine shall be kept entirely.

                   same hath not moued them to help hir, considering they haue nothing more commended vnto thē, than the ayde and succoure of Ladies and Damsels, of whome they are required? much more then by good reason of your daughter, that knew thē and estéemed them of long time. Beléeue me my Lord, that they be not wholly in faulte, and ye shall knowe in the end, that their intention was not to trouble you, presuming peraduenture that ye were importunately driuen to make this mariage, and against your will.
            
            
               A letter sent by Oriane being in the inclosed Ile, to the Queene hir mother, by the which she declareth vnto hir the troubles and tormēts that she receiued vpō the Sea, and how that the knights of the inclosed Ile, taking pitie on hir, haue succoured hir, & that it wold please hir to appease hir fathers anger, & counsell the Ambassadors (whome they send to the king) howe they shall do, to be well receiued. In the .4. booke the 7. Chapter.
               MAdame, in asmuch as ye are already aduertised (as I beloue) of my misfortune such as it hath bin, so it semeth to me to stand with good reason, to make you partaker of my sorowes: & for the beginning of this letter to pray you most hūbly to cōsider, how my misfortune hath perswaded me after that ye banished me out of your countrey, from the king my fathers presēce, & frō yours also, a thing to me almost vnsupportable: but ye not cōtēt therwith, I was brought by ye tēpest, (ye Romaines which cōducted vs being ouerthrowē) to the inclosed Ile, by those yt knowing the wrōg that mē did vnto vs, haue hazard their liues to kepe & to let vs passe any

further: And bycause I doubt that such a thing cannot be pacified betwene my father and them without great effusion and shéeding of bloud (except you Madame take the care therof) I thought good to sende this bearer vnto you, praying you for ye honour of God, to take compassion of your daughter to greatly desolate, and to do so muche with the king, that she may returne vnto him, and be in his fauor, not hauing offended him, except he hath taken displeasure, that I haue obeyed him too much: for in that thing only I hold me culpable and faultie, and no otherwise. And to aduise you of that that remayneth, how that they, in whose power I and my women are at this present, will send Ambassadors to hym, as wel to know how he taketh the succoure that they haue made me, as to pray him to haue pitie vpon me: as I haue charged Durin, to giue you knowledge before their cōming, wherevnto (Madame) ye shal help me, if it so please you, and also to make peace and an end of this great warre through euill fortune now begun, the whiche is in this your most humble and obedient daughter Oriane.
               
            
            
               The Oration of Quedragant to king Lisuard from the knights of the inclosed Iland, by the which he sheweth him the office of a king to receiue an Ambassage: and that he ought to excuse the enterprise of the knights of the inclosed Iland, and to receiue the Lady Oriane his daughter into his court, and into as great fauor as he did before. In the .4. booke the 7. Chapter.
               SYr, it is a very laudable vertue and worthy of commendation among kings and princes, to vnderstand and with great pacience the thing that the Ambassadors of straungers are charged to say, and to declare vnto them, putting from them all passions, so that they, if the Ambassage that is made vnto them doth content them, may receiue the more ioy, and the Ambassadors better receiued and fauored: and contrariwise,

if they speake things that displease them, that this notwithstāding, they know how to dissemble their choler, & to giue them gratious answers, for the respect of the estate that they are called vnto. Sir I beséech you to pardon me, that I haue vsed suche deuastiations vnto you, swearing to you by my God, that I haue not done it for any doubt that we haue of the assurance that it hath pleased you to giue vs, but greatly to prayse the vertue of so good a Prince, that so liberally hath graunted vs the entrance into his countrie. O sir, the occasion of our comming to your maiestie, is by the commaundement of the best knight that we know, Amadis of Fraunce, and generally of all those that are with him in the inclosed Ale, the which do send you word by vs, that passing ouer lāds and straunge countries, searching for aduentures, as other wandring knights are acustomed to do, specially to succoure and help the féeble, whome men do vse outrageously and without reason, they haue bin aduertised by many, that ye sir, folowing rather a light and a disordinate wil than iustice and equitie, would (not beleuing the counsel of any of yours) disherite (with great iniurie & wrong) my Lady your daughter, marying hir to the Emperoure Patin againste hir will: and in very déede taking no compassion of hir, nor of hir teares and wéepings, and lesse regarding the end of such an enterprise, and that your subiects were not therwith contēt, ye haue deliuered hir to those that demaund hir. And bycause such vniust wayes are not onely displeasant vnto God, but also to those, that heare men speake thereof, he hath suffered that we should set a remedie, and that the Romaynes which conducted them, and the Ladies and damsels should come into our hands, the whiche defending themselues against vs, were destroyed, and some slayne, and all other taken prisoners. And as for the Ladies, I do declare vnto you, that they at this present are in the inclosed Ile with a good and a great company of knights, apointed and minded to shew them all the honoure that may be possible: for their intentiō was neuer

to trouble you nor them also, but to mainteine equitie, and to kéepe them from force and violēce, euen as you your selfe made them sweare at Windsor. And therfore they pray you, that preferring vertue & reason aboue al passion, it wol
                     •
                   please you to receiue my Lady Oriane your daughter, & from henceforth to entreate hir, not as a straunger, but as a father ought to entreat his daughter, not putting hir thus awaye from you, nor from your countrey, whereof, if it please God, she shall be after you Quéene and Lady: and if you féele any iniurie, nor will not incline to their request, they pray you that for their sakes ye will not denie hir your good grate and fauor, but that ye, she reigning as she was wōt to do in your court, may assay hereafter if ye thinke it good, to take suche vengeance of them as ye may, assuring you sir, that they be purposed and intend, if ye assayle them, to defend thēselues. Therfore aduise you, if it please you, to make vs an answer, for ye haue in your hand either peace or warre.
            
            
               The answer of king Lisuard to Quedragāt, declaring the great wrong and iniurie that the knights of the inclosed Ilande haue done him, and that he will not receiue them to his fauor, vntill they haue made amends for the iniurie that they haue done him. In the .4. booke the .7. Chapter.
               MY masters (quoth the king) forasmuch as vertue dothe very seldome accompany temerarious orations, or bold answers, and that nother the one nor the other are sufficient to encourage the minds of the weake harted, I wil not make many words with you, but vsing more pacience thā I shuld vse with you, it shall suffise you to declare that I know well ynough, that the enterprise that hath bin done by those of the inclosed Iland, was more executed by presumption, than by the magnanimitie of courage (whatsoeuer ye haue said now) in such wise, that forasmuch as ye esteme to haue gotten honor, yet euery man of good iudgement shoulde blame and rebuke

you: for why, it is no great matter to trouble or to destroy them that take their iourney without suspiciō or feare, and specially when they thinke to be among their friendes. And as touching the demonstration that ye haue proposed here, tending to call my daughter Oriane againe, withoute putting hir farre from me, ye are not they vnto whome I must giue account of the things that I do, but to God only, the which hath constituted me (after him) the soueraygne in this land, for to gouerne and rule the same, and the people that doth inhabit it. Therefore I am not minded to enter into any treatie of peace with them, vntill they haue recompenced me of the iniurie that I haue receiued: then I will aduise me of the thing that they request me of, and not before.
            
            
               Grumedans Oration to the Ambassadors, declaring that he is very sory for the trouble that is chaunced, and that peace can hardly be intreated. In the .4. booke the .7. Chapter.
               BY God my good Lords I am very sore displeased for this new trouble: I had a continual hope, that I should see you one day as welcome to the court, as euer ye were: but now I do well assure my selfe, that the peace which was hoped for
                     •
                   shall come very slowly, without the helpe of our Lorde, the which doth know the hart of Amadis, whome I would neuer haue thought to be in the inclosed Iland: for we had newes, that he was lost foure yéeres since, and I wonder how that he so readily and in time is come to the succoure and help of my Lady Oriane.
               
            
            
               The Oration of king Arban of Norgales to king Lisuard, vpon the enterprise of the warre against Amadis, and that he shuld aduise himselfe well, wisely to conduct it, and if he coulde, rather to practise a lucratiue peace, than to put himselfe in the perill of warre. In the .4. booke the .8. Chapter.
               
                  Syr, seing that ye are resolued to make war against Amadis and those of his league, & that ye haue not found theyr offer good that they haue made you, ye must so aduise you to conduct it, that the glory may cōtinue with you: for notwithstanding we hold for certain, the victorie to be in the hand of God, the which doth giue it, when and to whome it pleaseth him, and cōmonly after the merites of persons, yet we must not before we take it in hand, leaue off diligently to prouide for all things requisite and necessarie there vnto, and that without dispraysing of your enemie, and esteming him su
                     •
                  
                  ficient to put you to much paine, if fortune do fauor him: considering that oftētimes a man trusting too much to his right, or in his strength, commeth to ruine and totall destructiō by him that thought (through too great presumption) the victory to be due vnto him. And yet if ye consider wel with whome ye haue to do, I thinke that a profitable peace shoulde be for you as honorable, as a warre that is in hazard, and that may turne to a great consequence. Ye know that Amadis and the other of whome he is supported, are all good knightes, and men of great courage, and al of the aliance of kings and puisant Princes, the which will neuer fayle, them to die for it. And on the other side and part ye know, that the most parte of your subiects, neuer tooke nor found that deliberatiō to be good, that ye tooke in a manner by your selfe vpon the mariage of my Lady your daughter to the Emperoure, whereof this warre is nowe moued. And thus ye may be sure, that whatsoeuer countenance they make, they in a manner woulde be content that ye had the worse, bycause ye followed not thryr fantasie, notwithstanding that I doubt not, but that there is none of them but wyll serue you faythfully.
            
            
               
               Arcalaus Oration to King Arauigne, inducing him to make war and to runne vpon King Lisuard, and vpon Amadis, in such suche places of theirs, where they might be beste offended without succour, and to make warre there, where they be most letted and troubled. In the .4. booke the .18. Chapter.
               SYr, a foure dayes past I certainely vnderstoode, that King Lisuard and Amadis of Fraunce (two the most greatest enimies that ye may haue) are in such quarrell and strife, that there is no hope that euer they shall haue peace together, they gather greate companies of men to fighte and to giue battell, whereof there cannot ensue and follow but the finall destruction of the one or other, and peraduenture of both together. And bicause the occasion doth nowe call you, aswell to reuenge you of the losse that you haue had by them in times past, as also to extende your limites & borders, making your selfe peaceable King of England, I thinke ye should defer no longer to gather your people together, and to call for all your friendes, that whilest they be letted, ye may easely enter into their countrey, being far off from their aide and succour: and if it chaunce that they méete together and fight, then not gyuing the Uictor any leysure to refreshe his men, ye must sode
                     •
                  ly take him, and geue him so sore a battell, that neither of them both escape. And ye shall vnderstand syr, that the occasion of their enmitie doth procéede, bicause that King Lisuard sent his eldest daughter to Rome, giuyng hir in mariage to the Emperour: but Amadis of Fraunce, one of them that caused himselfe to be named in the battel, that we lately lost, the knight of the serpentes, the which had (if ye may remember it) the gilded harneis, with many other, met the Romanes vpon the field whom they inuaded, and finally destroyed and flew the Prince Salust Quide the Emperours nigh knisman, the other taken prisoners with the Ladies and Damsels, the which they haue caried and conueyed into the enclosed Iland where they retaine them as yet: and yet I cannot well declare

you the cause why they began
                     •
                  e this warre, but I am sure that King Lisuard to reuenge his iniurie prepareth the greatest armie that he can, and that Amadis in like case hath sent into all partes to gather men to defende him if he be assayled. And therefore Syr, during this trouble ye shall haue (if ye will) a meane to giue them both ye greatest ouerthrow of all the world, taking them vnawares as I haue tolde you. And to the end and intent that ye may at your eye, know the victorie to be certaine, I will doe so much that Bersimen Lord of Sanguese, the sonne of him that the King caused to be burnt at London, and likewise all those of the linage of Dardan the proude, whom Amadis destroyde at Windesor, shal come and helpe you, with the King of the profounde and déepe Ile: and thus beyng with so great a number of good knightes, ye shall not néede to doubte but that ye shall come to your intent and purpose.
            
            
               King Arauignes answere to Arcalaus, by the which he is purposed to follow his counsell. In the .4. booke the .8. chapter.

Seing therfore that I am in these termes, I wil beleue you, praying you (whilest that I

shall prepare my armie) to order the rest, & to go to Barsinan and the other, and to cause them to ioyne with vs.
            
            
               Agraies Oration to the knights of the inclosed Isle, vpon the enterprise of the warre, inciting them to shew themselues vertuous and strong in the businesse that doth offer it selfe. In the fourth booke the .10. chapter.
               MY lords, I cannot tell how that we with honestie may delay to take vpon vs this warre, seing the iust occasiō that we haue, and that our enimie euen now maketh as though he would come to finde vs: but yet who so wil beleue me, he shall neither get, nor obtaine the honor: but yet let vs doe our diligence to assemble our strength, and let vs go into his cuntrey, and cause our selues to be knowne for such men as we be: for once if we suffer them to come hyther, we shal set thē in such a pride, that he (which of his nature is presumptuous) shall thinke to haue already the vpper hand of vs, and so we shalbe in diuers maner of sorts yll estemed, giuing occasion to many to doubt as much of our right, as of my lady Orianes, for whō we are fallen into these matters. As touching my selfe, I sware vnto you vpon my honor, that if it had not béen for the instant and great prayer and request that she made vnto me to haue peace, I had neuer consented that they shoulde haue sente any Ambassadours into Englande, béeyng so outrageously vsed as we be. But feyng that our enimie doth declare so muche vnto vs, I am quited of my promise, and resolued neuer to enter into amitie or aliance with him, vntill he hath felt howe greatly we may anoye him or helpe him, séeing that we haue the wayes to recouer as warlikemen of warre, as they be which he shall bryng with him. Thus my maisters I am of this mind, that we prepare our selues to war, without any longer delaye, and that we assone as our aide is aryued, go straight to London (if he come forwards to fight with vs) to giue him battell.

And as concerning that they thinke it good we shoulde enter into King Lisuardes land, nor to giue him leysure to come & finde vs here, I haue bene euer of this minde, if the rest of you my Lordes and good friendes will the same: for by this meanes he (perceiuing that we aproche so nigh vnto him) will chaunge p

And therefore he hath commaunded me to shewe you, that if ye be minded to take vengeance on them, that he will bring a great armie into the fielde, if ye of your part will doe the like, being assured that if your strength be once ioyned, you and he shall easely bring them to suche a point and reason as ye shall thinke good.

               SYr, ye haue good cause and reason so to thinke: for certainly my great age and estate where vnto it hath pleased the Lorde to haue called me long since, doth well excuse me to be among this bloudy people: yet considering the euill that myghte haue happened if I had deferred my enterprise, I haue not feared to trauell my body, trusting to doe agreable seruice to God, and healthfull to your soule.

My sonne, ye may sée howe old and how caduke I am, so that nature doth almost fayle me, and yet I feare not to take vpon me thys long iourney to come to you, bycause I (being in my hermitage) haue perceiued the discord that is betwene you and king Lisuard, with whome I haue spoken of late, and do find him such, as a good Prince should be, the seruant and minister of God, and prest (if there be no let in you) to gyue an eare to peace, the whych ye should not refuse, as well for the quietnesse and rest of your conscience, as of your body. And to the intent ye should not disguise youre fantasie, I maye assure you, that I knowe more of your affayres than ye thinke, for my Lady Oriane hathe tolde me in confession, the secretes of you both.

But yet seing it is your pleasure that I first before all other shall say and shew mine aduise, it séemeth to me (I speake vnder correction) that if the peace be offered vs by our enimies, that we should accept it: for it cannot come at thys tyme, but to your aduantage, hauing not onely the ouerhand of him, but also my Lady Oriane as yet in youre puissance and power, for whose sake we haue brought this host into the féeld.

And doing thys, ye shall

                  o your friendes, the which to succour you in such businesse, haue not spared their own liues, the which do binde you to loue them, & honor them, & moreouer to recompence thē the best ye may possible, considering that without the aide that they haue holpen you withall, it is most certain ye should haue béen in great doubt to léese, not only your life but your honor, the which is estéemed a hundred times more. And therfore it is reason, that euen as they haue béen partakers of the perils and daungers, that they be now also of the pleasures and contētations that ye haue receiued by thē. So then aduise you to fauor them in all that ye shall know them to be affectionated vnto, distributing vnto thē the pray that is in your hands, hauing the Kings Arauigne, Barsinan, and other prisoners. And furthermore, to do so much for those whō ye know to pretend any affection to the Ladies which are in ye company of Oriane, that they may haue like contētation as ye haue, marying thē to those that they do like and loue. And for this cause I put into your hands your sister Melicia, to giue hir vnto him that ye shal estéeme to deserue hir. Ye haue also your cousin Mabile, the Quéene Briolanie, that hath so greatly bound you vnto hir, Grasinde, and the Quéene Sardamire, the which haue had a good part of Orians annoyance & troubles: I do thinke that they shuld also féele of hir ease and aduancement, I commende thē vnto you, assuring you, that the greatest pleasure that I can haue in my olde age and yeares is, that your bretheren

And in asmuch as I am bound vnto you, I assay & proue by al meanes to cause you to haue ye thing that I shal perceiue & know ye haue most affection vnto, for I by your good helpe that ye haue gyuen and shewen me, haue obtained ye thing that I loued best in al the world, that is, my lady Oriane: Therefore I pray you with al my hart, that euery one of you do presently declare & shew me, if he pretend or haue any minde to any of these Ladyes & Damsels that be here, assuring you by the faith of a knight so to labour therin, that with the good contentation & wyll of their friendes, they shall beleue me in that, that I shal desire and pray them. And furthermore ye know how that Kyng Arauigne, Barsinan. and many other our prisoners, leauing and forsaking the vertue whervnto they were bounde by the order of chiualrie, haue exercised, asmuch as they could, so great tyrannie, that they are not worthy of any raunsome, but of great punishment, for ye greuousnesse of their treasons. And therfore I do thinke ye should deuise to part and deuide their goods among you. And as touching me, I quite and refuse my part, holding my selfe a great deale more than satisfyed, if I might finde and haue the meanes and wayes perticularly to do you pleasure or seruice, that might content you.

               The Oration of Cormellie to Esplandian, the which was sore astonyed of the thing that Leonorine sent him word of, aduising him not to take in euill part the answer that Leonorine had sent his father, and that the dissimulation of the loue of Ladies ought not to be takē as a refusing, in asmuch as it signifieth most often perfyte and entire amitie. In the 5. booke the .33. Chapter.

                  oule now I know well that the affections and loue of men do greatly differ from the passions that we simple women indure when we fal into this extremitie: and know you wherein? ye men do cōmonly take pleasure to open the thing that ye loue, be it by word or by countenance: and oftentimes ye fayne moreouer that there is no such thing, and (
                     •
                  hat is worsse) the more that the Lady or damsell the whiche is loued be of a good house, and of great merite, so much ye more ye do glory, wherby men know, that not only ye beare them affection, but that ye are loued, and that she beareth you good wil aboue al other: the which is very contrarie to the nature of womē, I meane of such as may name themselues wise: for why, the higher that the parēts be, the more feare they haue that mē should perceiue their amorous passions, and in such sort, that ordinarily they denie with word, gesture, and countenance, the thing that they haue most printed in their hart and mind. And not without cause, considering that the thing which ye turne to prayse (as ye think that your loue is made manifest) doth bring vnto them and their honor a certayne spot, the which oftentimes they cannot well deface. So then it is more than necessarie to obserue this modestie and constancie

Thus my Lord, if séemeth to me that ye should take in good part, and greatly to your aduantage, the purpose that Gastilles hath written vnto you, that ye were bound to my Lady Leonorina, and in the presence of the Emperour: for I answer you vpon my honour, that both your affections are reciprokes, and that she hath spoken very wisely, vsing suche dissimulation. I say not but that she had some occasion to be miscontented, considering and seing the wordes which I at other times haue brought hir from you, but that is easely amended: And if the amitie & loue that she so long hath borne you should be vtterly broken (as I thinke it be not) nother more nor lesse than a bowe that is broken, & péeced together agayne, the whiche is more stronger in the place that it is mended in, than in any other, so you being present and in hir company, shall bring togither and amend that ye shall finde broken: and shall make hir to be much more yours than euer she was. And therefore I would counsell you, that obeying hir, ye goe vnto hir, and euē to morow, if it be possible.
            
            
               A letter from Armato the king of the Turkes, to all the princes of the Orient, commaunding them to bring togither their force and strength, to chase the Christians out of his limits, and to conquer the Empire of Constantinople. In the .5. booke the .45. Chapter.

the lands that are in the parts of the Orient, gréeting. At my retourning out of prison whereof we are now deliuered, I thought it good to giue you knowlege, that not long since, ther is come out of the North countrey (as men say) into these coastes a knight of the line of Brutus the Troyane, vnto whome our gods haue permitted for our vnrighteousnesse (as it is very like) to conquere the mountaine defended, putting to death Matroco and Furion, two knightes estéemed among the best of all the Orient. And that they do, that is far worse, dayly increase the number of Christians, and labour to exterminate and destroy our holy law. To withstād this, we haue taken armes vpon vs, and prepared a strong and a puissāt armie, thinking at the least, to driue them out of our limites. But yet after that we had kept a long siege before the mountaine Defended, and had brought it to such extremitie, that they which were within had no more vitailes, he of whome we doubted most, and the firste that enterprised this warre, found a meane (by the fauoure of a vile palliard, one of ours, called Frandalo) to enter in, and by cautell and subtiltie to take vs, in such sort, that our armie was destroyed, and we remayned as prisoners in their handes, where they kept vs for the space of a whole yeare most strayghtly: during the same, our affayres fell from ill to worse: so by treson & craftinesse, they be in possessiō of Alfarin and of Galatia, two of the best hauens of our realme. The which they should neuer haue done, without the help & succour of that traytor & vnfaithful Emperour of Constantinople. And now they gather so much people, that without your ayde, we be in danger to fall into their mercie: a thing that shall be of greate consequence, seing that we be (as ye know) the frontier and rampier of you all. Therefore we praye you and admonishe you in our Gods, that as well for the defence of our Lawe, as for the vtilitie of all the countrey of the East, ye assemble your strength in so greate a number, that we maye chase and driue awaye these Christians from our borders, and

conquer the Empire of Constantinople, vnto the partes of Fraunce and Englande, the which shall be vnto vs easy and profitable.

And for asmuch as they whose place and roome ye hold, haue bin euermore the true defenders and protectors of our Religion, and also bycause the case doth touch you so nigh, I thinke (my Lorde) that ye shoulde spare nothing that is in your might and power, but assemble your fores in all extremitie, and prepare your vassals to help that good prince, the which is the borderer (as ye know) to you, and to all the potentates that hold of the law of Iesu Christ.

Therfore if it were to me honourable or reasonable, I would sooner and more willingly make amitie with you, thā passe ouer with aduantage to proue our persons one against the other: but hauing no order, neither you, nor I cannot refuse the combat that is offered, in so much as it should be an iniurie for you to leaue off the enterprise that ye haue begon, and to me great blame, not to follow the fortune that this beginning as euery man may sée hath giuen me. So then, let the victory be as it shall please fortune, and him haue it that can get it.
            
            
               A letter from the knight of the burning sworde to Magadan, wherein he excuseth him of his departing without leaue, and doth labour to enter into his grace and fauour, seyng he was founde without faulte. In the seuenth booke the .16 Chapter.
               RIght highe, right mightie, and right excellent Prince, if the things that be to come, were present to men, as they

be vnknowen vnto them, fewe men should finde themselues deceiued, and fewer euil men that might by falsely reporting things vnto them deceiue them. But such secretes being out of our power, certes we should feare more the malice of men than death it selfe, that causeth a man to die but once. For the deathe that ensueth and followeth these traitours and euill men, doth not onely take away life, but the immortal honor that euery vertuous person mighte obtaine and get, conuerting and turnyng hys good renoume to shame and blame, wherewith they féede the eares of them, that harken vnto them. And of thys (victorious King) ye may now iudge much better than of any other, beyng at the poynt to fall into the reputation of an vniust King, beyng in wyll and mynde so wrongfully to put the Quéene to deathe, throughe the false accusation that was reported to you of hir, and of your faithfull subiecte and seruaunt the Knight of the burning sworde. Not syr, that I will excuse me of the faulte that I dyd, absenting my selfe from your courte, following the counsell that Maudan gaue mee: for where my innocencie was, payne coulde haue no place. And furthermore, not leauing my honour doubtfull by my flying awaye, I shoulde rather haue submitted my selfe to your punishment, (knowyng your vertue and my iustice) than fearing your furie, and followyng the death, the whyche I deserued not, to render my selfe suspecte of the faulte. But the gods (as I vnderstand) haue suffered the truthe afterwardes to be discouered by him, that had charged it, and that the Quéenes honour, and mine was recouered by the inuincible valiantnesse of Amadis the King of England, ye which sustaining my right, slew the traitor in the plaine fielde of battell, before your maiestie. And neuerthelesse syr, if there yet doe reste any sparckle of euill will against your humble seruaunt, I beséeche you to forget it, and partly to take and to receiue me to your good grace & fauour, perceiuing that I haue a desire to returne to your excellencie, to whom I would already haue come, if it had not béene

for the promise that I made to these thrée Kings assembled, not to leaue thē vntill the warre taken in hande against two other traitors were ended. Therfore it may please you to excuse me, kissing the hands of your highnesse in all humilitie.
            
            
               The Oration of Abra to hir brother Zair Soudan of Babilon demaunding wherof his anoyance doth procede, to giue him a remedie. In the .8. booke the .2. Chapter.
               ALas my Lord, from whence may this accident procéede? I praye you not to hide the occasion any more from me, swearing vnto you by the faith that I owe you, that if there be any thing, wherewith I may giue you any remedie, I wil not spare my life for you: for why it can not continue, seeyng you suffer as ye doe.
            
            
               The Oration of Abra to the Princes and Lordes being in the Soudans Zair hir brothers court, declaring vnto them the vision of the foresayde Soudan, and perswading them to take in hande the combat against the Christians. In the .8. booke the .2. Chapter.
               EXcellent Princes, and great Lords, it semeth that fortune doth present to you all, one meane and way (seruing our gods) to augment their lawe, and to make lesse & diminishe that, by the which they are misprysed. And to declare vnto you, that I speake not without reason, ye shall vnderstande that the great God Iupiter & Mars appeered (one of these nights past) to your good Prince Zair, wherof the euill doth come that noth hold & trouble him. And they haue threatned him verie sore & reproued him, seing they called him not to such a highnesse, to let the faith of the christians to increase, and not to 
                     •
                  are for that, in the which he liued. And bicause he would not wholly fall into their indignation, bad to commaund you incontinently to enterprise the conquest of Trebisonde, or else

that we and he should be so well chastened, that prouing the rigorousnesse of fortune, we should come late to repentance. Thus if we will obey them, executing their holy will, we shall be sure of the victorie, and Zair shall mary Onoloria the Emperours daughter of whom I spake vnto you: of these two shal come so complet a knight, that ye sunne is not brighter among the starres, than his renoume shal be from the Orient to the Occident among men. And this is (Princes and Lordes) the cause, for the which the Soudan your soueraigne King hath caused him to be called for this day, purposing as touching his part, not to shewe himself any other, than most humble and most obedient to gods will, trusting that of your parte ye wil not be tardife in so good a worke, but cause your high valiantnesse and chiualrie that is in you, to be knowne throughout all the world, ye shall follow that is predestinate vnto you, of the which I may beare witnesse, for althoughe I be but a woman yet should I be very displeasant, that so glorious an enterprise should passe out of my presence & sighte. Thus honourable Princes, make ye together a resolution vpon this, that your king intended to shew you with his own mouth, if the euill that he féeleth, had not forbydden and letted him to speake, purposing wholly to ensue and follow the inspiration of Iupiter, and your good aduise, trusting in the faithfulnesse & zeale that euery one of you hath (as I thinke) to the encreasement of his honour, the which shall be your wealth and aduancement.
            
            
               A letter from Abra in the name of Zair hir brother Soudan of Babylon, to the Infant Onoloria, of whom (being very amorous) he laboureth to haue hir good grace and fauour. In the .8. booke the .7. Chapter.
               MAdam, I pray you as much as is possible, (reading thys letter) to consider howe Zair the Soudan of Babilon the king of the Pagan Princes, and the most mightie Monarch

that is this day vpon the earth, doth finde himselfe so beaten with the arrowes of the god of loue, the which being enforced fréely to declare vnto you the paine yt he indureth to be yours hath cōceiued this boldnesse to write this word vnto you, & to cause you to vnderstand, that ye seruitude that he beareth was diuinely motioned, and by the inspiration of Venus sonne: the which appearing one night among all other to me, represented to me the excellencie of your beautie so liuely, that he woulde me, the ruler and Lorde of Lordes, and that all my lyfe haue béene frée and withoute subiection, to become seruaunt and slaue of your good grace, the which thing I require you most humblye not to denie mée: but waying the greatnesse of my estate, and the noble bloude whereof I take my beginning, to vse me as I deserue: assuring you Madame, that hauyng this fauour, I shall estéeme it more than if the rest of the whole worlde toke me for theyr naturall Lord: and yet more if I myghte receiue some Iuell or some sleue of you to weare, ending the combattes that I haue set forth, to vpholde your perfecte beautie, the which far passeth all the most excellent that hath bene or maye be for euer: kissing for the ouerplus a thousand and a thousande times your diuine and white handes with all reuerence.

               I Maruell (Madam) how it is possible that with so great beutie and wisedome that is in you, rigour and disdaine maye haue any parte. Ye haue (as I haue vnderstanded) slenderly regarded the letter that the Soudan my brother hath writtē vnto you, and the euill that he suffereth in louing you so perfectly, as he hath certified you. I pray you for gods sake to cō
                  sider,

that his life, if ye vse long such crueltie towards him, will be short, and that ye shall leese (in léesing of him) the best and the most affectionated seruant, that euer ye shall get, and me also, the which hath merited more greater punishmente for the wrong that he hath done you, in louing you (if it may be cald wrong) than you him: for why he neuer thought but to obey and to please you, and I for to find some remedy for his vnmeasurable passion, the which hath bin the cause why I haue sent you (by one of my women) the thing that hathe somewhat better, (as she hath reported to me) contented you.
            
            
               The answer of Onoleria to Abra Zairs sister, reprouing hir of hir foolish enterprise, and that if hir brother make any further suite, she will cause it to be reuenged. In the .8. booke the .7. Chapter.
               I Thinke Madame, that it shoulde sufficiently ynough haue suffised you that ye haue done already, without charging me a new, and so, that if I haue had some occasion of griefe or anoyance against your brother, to haue bin on my part too much forgetfull. Now, where ye thinke to excuse him, ye accuse him the more, and do cause me to thinke, that ye doubt that I féele not my self to be the daughter of so great an Emperoure, and to be extract and to come of suche bloud, that I had rather neuer to haue bin, than for any thing to defile the least part of my honour. And therfore assure him that causeth you to vse such wordes, that I, if he continue in this foolishe suite, and you in your importunitie, shall aduertise suche a one, that in aduenging me, shall complayne of you, and of him, euen as ye merit and deserue.

                  RIght mightie and excellent prince, the representation that I beare of hir that hath not hir péere in perfect beutie, doth remoue the fault from me that I might haue receyued, not doing (at my comming) the honor and reuerence vnto you, that your highnesse merited. And for to declare the cause that moued me to come to this your court, ye shall vnderstand sir, that I purpose to mainteine and vphold against all men, that my Lady Oriane the Lady of all beautie, princesse of Apolonia, doth excéede in perfection all the most excellent of the world, as I hope to proue by armes, vnder such condition, that he the which will assay it, shall be constrayned, if he loue the daughter of any Emperoure or king, to beare hir in picture, as I do this, the which ye sée that I, if I remaine victor, may set his tablet in yt range of other, whom I haue conquered and wonne. And also where I should haue the worsse, I should fr

               The Oration of Zair Soudan of Babilon, to the Emperoure of Trebisond, in the which he hauing vaunted his fortunable conquests, doth protest that by and by he will be baptised, trusting that afterwards the Emperoure will not denie him his request. In the .8. booke the .11. Chapter.
               RIght mightie Emperoure, I estéeme that it is not of late that ye haue knowledge of the kingdomes and great prouinces, that I haue subdued and brought to my crowne, since the time that the Gods called me to rule the, best parte of Asia. And leading and in my owne person conducting my inuincible armies these long iorneis during, I neuer, shewed

my selfe to be tardious nor slouthfull: but (hauing no respect in the perill of heate, cold, nor of long time, nor of any other danger that presented it selfe,) I haue fréely and at will suffered them all, as the least of my souldiers, and in such sorte, that I (fortune fauoring) haue made fiftéene great kings my tributaries, of the which the most part haue folowed and accompanied me into your court, where they be as yet. Yea I haue bene taken all my life for the most fortunatest prince that euer bare Scepter, but all the prosperitie that I haue receyued in times past, is little or nothing, in respect of one that ye shall vnderstand, and whereof I thinke that both you and all this nobilitie shall maruell. It hath pleased God the creator, to haue kept me in this your great citie, and therewith to giue me the knoweledge of the true faythe, that you Christians do obserue: and in the which I do intende to liue and die, hauing no greater displeasure in my heart, but that I haue differred so long to do it. And to the intent ye may sée by the effect thereof, that I speake not in vayne, by and by, and in the presence of this assemblie and company, I, my sis

               The complaint of Zair Soudan of Babilon, for the Infant Onoloria, the which had left him, to aquaint hir with Lisuard. And he complayneth sore of hir vnfaythfulnesse and faulte committed by hir. In the .8. booke the .11. Chapter.

Wherefore then being depriued (as I am, both of the floure, & of the fruite togither) do I thus trouble my selfe, and for hir that (after the ensample of a she wolfe) doth leaue me, and choose Lisuard, for disdayning me a seruāt, to make hir selfe a seruant and a slaue, and to giue hir to him, léesing by this meanes the best thyng that was in hir.

But what? It is very like, that she taketh little thought, or none, seing that she dothe continue and is beloued of him, vnto whome she hath bin so liberall of hir body. Ah cruell fortune, fortune ingrate and blind. Lisuard alone doth triumph in abundance, and I die of necessitie. Is it then possible that she at any time will be agreable vnto me? Should I thus suffer my body to perish and consume, and furthermore to require so ingrat a person? No no, my dayes shall sooner die, than my affection shal at any time returne to hir agayne, nor it were no reason. And yet that euill man which hath procured me this iniurie and torment, shall pay the shot, causing him to léese (if I may) his life and his honor togither.
            
            
               
               A very chast answer of the Infant Gradafilea to Lisuart, to whome she sheweth his lightnesse, and protesteth howe she would that hir conuersation should be chast with him. In the 8. booke the .15. Chapter.
               IN good fayth my friend (quoth she) ye are (as farfoorth as I can sée) greatly deceyued, and therwith ye do me wrong, to estéeme and thinke to diminish my payne with a certayne shame too vnfortunate for my honour. I pray you faire sir, neuer to haue your Grandafilea in such opinion, to thinke by hir, that the forces and strength of loue be sufficient to corrupt hir chastitie, not hir chast will, & vertues: these things being only reserued to mariage, and not for the sensual appetites worthy to be blamed. Also that I now do wéepe, is not to sée my selfe frustrate of my intention, but only for the consideration that I haue, that ye shall not as long as ye lyue, come to the thing that ye haue vnder the shadow to mitigate and swéetely to ease the euill that tormenteth me presumed of me. For ye may be certaine and sure of this, seing that Onoloria onely doth merit you, that my will shall neuer haue more power vpon me, than I haue ouer it, the loue that I beare you cōtinuing with my chastitie, and my certain hope, my desire vnexecuted, and my trauell in repose and rest: nor searching no nother thing but your continuall presence and company, with the which I shall féele in my selfe more glory and contentation of mind, than if I had the entier fauors, great goodes, and preheminences, that all other kings and princes of the earth may graunt and giue me. Therefore I pray you, that this honest amitie, and ordinarie loue that I desire with you, be not refused nor denied me: but to suffer me for euer to folow you vnder this pretext and condition, that the faithfulnesse that ye owe to my lady your wife, be in no wise corrupted, but so certayne and sure, as if she ordinarily had you hanging vpon hir ne

               Lisuart doth prayse the excellent answer of Gradafilea, and the great vertue that is in hir, not suffering hir selfe to be deceiued by foolish loue, for the whiche vertue he dothe verye much esteeme hir, and doth declare that he is ready to obey hir demaund. In the .8. booke the .16. Chapter.
               BY God Madame (as farre as I may perceiue and knowe by the things that are in you) the works of God are great and wonderfull: and it should be ill and hard to be beléeued, without one saw it and vnderstood it, that in the person of a damsell yong and fayre, might be so much force and vertue, ye which truly do merit you the first place amōg them, whose renoume doth as yet liue this day. The which doth cause me to esteeme much more the constancie which is in you, than that of the Romaine, the whiche with ioyfulnesse of heart burnt his owne arme. Also the crueltie that he prepared for himselfe, is not comparable to the torment that ye haue willed, and will suffer for the loue of me: for he that I speake to you of, outraged only in one of his members: and you the example of all Chastitie, haue suffered (to saue your honor) not your arme only to be burnt, but through force of loue, the heart, and the body where the gentle soule, and the spirit so perfect doth repose and rest. By the occasion whereof, I promis my selfe full well, that there was neuer knight so bound to any Lady or Damsell, as I am to you, in somuch that I may vaunt my selfe, that fortune hath bin more fortunable to me, than to any of those, bringing me so low, to exalt me in an instant to so high a degrée, preparing the occasion to cause me to be of the most sage, fayre, and chast princesse of the earth so perfectly loued, and so, that with good right I shal mainteine against all, that nother the renoume of Amadis of Fraunce my Grandfather, nor the hardinesse of my father, and much lesse the high actes of the knight of the burning sword (whose valiantnesse hath already compast the world) cannot reasonably be made egall to my good houre and fortune,

that I reioycing do féele in me, and with so great difference of the honorable loue of two the highest Ladies of the earth. And as touching that ye demaund of me, said he, wherof I my selfe should haue first required you, I graunt it you with a very good heart, reputing your companie so vantagious and gainfull to me, that I will neuer leaue you agaynst your will, so that force and prison constrayne me not.

                  ie, that no lady nor damsell of this time is to be compared vnto hir, giueth salutation to the noble, greatly renoumed, and right valiant knighte of the burning sword. Know therfore that his excellence, of whome I haue not as yet bin séene, nor looked vpon by any man liuing, for my presence is forbiddē them, and my beautie no lesse preiudiciall, thā the venemous sight of the Basiliske. By the occasion whereof, they kéepe me close in thys strong towre, accompanied with women only, the whiche it hath pleased my father the Soudan to giue and apoynt me. But that notwithstanding, the renoume of your valiantnesse and good grace hath so flown and so spread it selfe here, that it hath made an entier and a whole conquest of my heart, for your wealth only, and the hurt of all other: and yet without altering herein my honour in any thing, mariage only (kéeping the thing that ought most to be kept and commended to all vertuous Ladies) shall giue place to my contētation, & to the goodnesse ye ye ought to desire, being so fauored of fortune, ye she shall cause you to loue hir, & to be amiable to hir whom no other but you only doth merit to serue.

Therefore receyuing the houre and time that the Gods haue reserued for you, I pray you incontinent as ye haue receyued and red my letter, to come and sée hir that no man could see but to his disaduantage and certayne euil, hauing al that is good in hir, dedicated vnto you, and that to ioyne togyther the paragon of all beautie, with the excellence of cheualrie. Busando my féeble dwarffe shall tell you the rest from me, whome ye may beléeue, (if it please you) as my selfe.

I say this, because that my life is not only in peril and danger, but my owne honor, the which thing is worse. Therefore my Busando, I pray thée to haue before thine eyes, the confidence that I haue in thée, knowingfull well that who so deliuereth his secret to another, to him is committed the thing that he ought to kéepe more derely than his owne affection. And so thou shalt haue in remembrance as well to hide my thought, as I haue had paine first to open it vnto thée.

Tell me ingrate, is this the reciproke loue wherewith thou wast bound to me, giuing thée knowledge of the goodnesse that I desired and wished thée? Is this the recognising of the election and choise that I made of thy person, to be my Lord & spouse? Is this the fruite of my esperance and hope, that thou didst then put me in, whē that in ye presence of so many princes I required thée to voutsafe to take me to thy wife and perpetuall louer? hauing thée so

well printed in my heart, that thou shouldst not depart from thence, as lōg as life shuld rest, but shouldst be resident there, to norish my desire the better, that I haue to reuēge ye death of my wel beloued brother. But alas, who would euer haue thought that the fearefull sea shuld haue bin consecrate with his body and sepulture? Certesse I beléeue that the sea is ignorāt, that she hath him drowned in the depnesse of hir waters. For if she had knowen it, it is very like, that the waters would already haue triumphed, yea in communication with the soueraigne heauens, holding themselues honored, to enioy his bloud and diuine body. And if the sea be not yet aduised, nor the earth as yet hath not perceiued it, it woulde not haue delayed hir complaintes and dolours so long from the soueraigne Gods, to haue and to recouer hir spouse and hir iust possessor agayne, that hath bin vsurped from hir domination, and put into so contrary an element: whereof peraduenture may chance in time to come continuall warre betwene hir roundnesse & the depenesse of the abismes, each of them pretending the reioycing and gard of his prince and magnificent dominator and ruler. But if these two do complayne, the fire and his element will not holde their peace, but shall complayne them for euer, through the regard and consideratiō of the sacrifices that the gods hoped for, if he had dyed and deceased vpon the earth.

But alas alas, what vengeance shall be done for him, for whome the ayre, the

At the end (I say) of my life, bycause that cruell loue will not

suffer the vengeance vpon thée, but that I must sacrifice my selfe to adorne thy death, that shall make myne very happy and fortunate. So shall thy funeralles be entirely celebrated by the death of Zair and of me, to the end that fortune make them egall at the victorie, the which she would haue graunted thée, not only in thy life against knights and beasts most cruell, but in the death that she shall procure thée, that as long as she shall liue defieth thée, the which shall be no longer, than thou shalte be resident in the worlde, that by such and so straunge crueltie the desire of my vengeaunce may be executed.

But after that I knew that fortune whiche sometimes was his friend, had suffered hys bloud to be shed, leauing me by this meanes and for euer without a husbande, that there shoulde remayne no other that myghte come vnto the merite of my highnesse, béeing suche a princesse as I am, and indued with the beautie that the Goddes haue gyuen me, by whose aduise, the mariage of vs twayne had bene consummated, if misfortune (as it hathe done) hadde not sayde agaynste vs:

but whatsoeuer impediment or let that vnkind fortune hath done to my destinie, yet it cannot hide nor quench the glory of Zair, his death being reuenged by thine. And to come thervnto, I defye thée as touching thy person and mine, and with what weapon thou wilt choose, the campe being before the palace of the right puisant Emperour of Trebisond. And to the intent thou despise not this combat, bicause thou art presented by a woman, I do open vnto thée, that the custome of Sarmate hath gotten and procured me the possession of cheualrie, and the name of a knight, and in such sort, that the victorie that thou shalt obtayne vpon me, (if thou obtayne it) shall be very noble, bicause of diuers other that I haue won vpon many as valiant as thou art, the whiche haue proued the force and strengthe of my armes. And thy auncient glory shall be nothing the lesse, (notwithstanding the good countenance that fortune hath born thée and shewed thée hitherto) but greatly aduanunced, hauing the vpper hande of suche a Quéene, and so mightie as I am, and that desireth to extinguish (to hir power) this cruelnesse, wherewith the beautie of thy eye can ouercome (as men say) and conquer the high Ladies and damsells that sée and behold thée.

Truly madame, the highnesse of your estate, and the beautie that doth accompanie you with this valiantnesse whereof ye are renoumed, doth right well merite, that men shuld estéeme you such a one as ye are. But I wil neuer easely consent, yt ther are not other Princes, Lords, and knightes ynough and as good or better than Zair, to ioyne with you in mariage, and to satisfie and supply his defaulte. As concerning the rest, I promise you, that I am sore displeased for the combat and fight that ye wil enterprise at al vtterāce & assayes against me. For ye being but a womā, are more to be feared for your great beautie thā for the force of your armes, considering that I am more accustomed to put my life in hazard, & to serue you & other lyke vnto you, than to defend me & to fight against them. But yet seing that in regard of this, ye woulde be rather taken for a valiant & a hardy knight, than for a swéete & a gracious damsell, defying me, as concerning your own person and mine, I accept it. And to reserue apart the obligation that I owe vnto your seruice, I remitte vnto you the election and choyce of armes. For I trust so much in your natural goodnesse, yt you your self, shal be wonne of your self, without séeking the victorie vpon you, wherby I may rather defend my self against

those that haue occasion to enterprise to assaile me. As concerning the campe and other things required by this prudent Lady, they shal be graunted you as she hath of your parte demaunded them. The time shall be fiftie dayes hence, to the entent that with ye solemnitie of so glorious an enterprise, my mariage may the better be celebrated and honored.

But séeing she is so stiffe in hir opinion, and finally bicause she shall not estéeme me otherwyse than I am, I promise hir, that she shall not only haue suertie of the campe and fielde bicause she demaundeth it, but in all other things that she shall estéeme méet to doe hir pleasure and seruice: for although she doth trauell all that is possible to cause me to léese my life, yet I will not leaue off to take paine to honor hir, and to serue hir as long as I shal haue occasion and meanes to do it.
            
            
               The knighte of the Burning sword dothe accuse Lisuarde of Greece to haue falsifyed his promise to Abra the Princesse of Babilon, and that vniustly he slewe the Soudan Zair, and vpon this he doth present him the combat. In the .8. booke the .48.
               SOueraigne Prince (said Amadis of Greece then) the accidents and chaunces of fortune be such, that oftentimes men doe finde themselues more constrained (by obligation, than by their will) to doe that they ought to doe, as presently I maye experiment and proue in my selfe, whereof the perill of my enterprise hereafter shall be witnesse, seing that I beyng but a simple knight, and vnknowē both of name & of armes haue bene bolde to demande & require campe and to fight against thée most comely & valiant Prince of the earth: trusting that if I be ouercome, the glorie of the victorie gotten vpon me by you, can not redound vnto me but to my honour, keping companie with so many other more estéemed than I am, and of whom ye haue the vantage. And when the houre and tyme shall staye vnto me, be it neuer so little, God knoweth in

what reputation I shall passe forth from hence forwards the rest of my life. Upon the hope whereof, I will maintaine that ye haue (against the duetie whereto your Royall estate doth binde you) disdained not onely the loue, wherof ye are indetted to the Princesse of the Parthes, and fayled as concerning the gift that ye promised hir in the presence of so many Princes and Lordes, but also sheding the noble bloud of the Soudan Zair: and for this cause I defie you at all assayes to the end that either by your heade or myne, your ingratitude may be manifest, and that the death of the Prince Zair, Soudan of Babilon hath béene too vniustly enterprised by you and your fellowes. And for as much as after the right of ye combattes, it is my duetie to choose the fielde, I declare vnto you, that it shall be before this palace in the place where I haue seen in time past a womā inchanted (as men told me) Puruey for the rest, as vnto you it shall seme best.
            
            
               Lisuard doth answere Amadis of Greece, the knight of the Burning sworde, praising him for the modest defiance that he hath made him. Afterwardes he dothe excuse him of the charges imposed and laide vnto him, finally he doth accept the campe presented, and doth make the election of armes. In the .8. booke the .49. Chapters.
               SYr knight, the gracious communication, and the honest fashiō of the defiance that ye haue vsed against me, hath not giuen me lesser estimation of your person, than of the valiantnesse that I certenly beleue to be in you, for such curtesies are commōly accompanied with high and stout hearts. And for asmuch as I repute you such a one as ye are, & that it may be (through euill information) that it may hazard your honor wrongfully, and offende my iustification, I am content that ye first vnderstande howe the things go in veritie and truth, to the intente that vnder an euill quarrell ye leese not the thing, that other wyse (throughe the valiantnesse that is in

you) shuld be easy to be conquered with equitie. There is nothing more certaine, nor I wil not denie it, but that the princesse of the Parthes demaunded a gifte of me, the whiche I liberally graunted hir, but euery man doth know, that men should not, nor are not bound to giue or demaunde more thā is possible, for the possibilitie failing, the obligation and promise taketh no place. Abra required me to marie hir, and I was bound already, so that it was not in my power. As concerning the death of hir brother, whereof she is so heavie, by God and bicause Zair went aboute and did treason, and that that was naughte, the whiche he inuented against my Lorde the Emperour, the Empresse, my ladies their children and other, she hath more reason and cause to complaine hir of hys honor, than of the chastisement yt he, as it is to be presumed receiued by the diuine iudgement of God. And yet I wyll well confesse, that for the loue of hir, I desire that he were yet aliue: but seing that his daies (fighting like a good knight) are at an end, and that she hath receiued the crowne and Empire of Babilon, as a sage & a vertuous Princesse as she is, I thinke that she shoulde forget hir teares and quarrels, and to take reason for payment without desiring thus my head to sacrifice it to the vnrighteousness of hir brother. And to the verifying of the same, I will take paine (sauing my selfe) to haue yours at such mercie, as ye 
                     •
                  e desire mine. And to doe this, I accepte the defiance, and the fielde by you presented. The armes are these accustomed among knightes of honor, shield & speare, & the day, seuen night for your solace: for I suppose that ye are sore trauailed, bicause of the long iourney that ye haue made. The iust and the right God be the kéeper both of the honor and right of him of vs two, vnto whome it pertaineth.
            
            
               
               Zahera the Queene of Cauease doth submit hir selfe to doe (hir honour saued) the wil of Lisuard after the conditions of the combat, in the whiche she (as she saithe) was ouercome. In the .8 booke the .49. Chapter.
               THe truth is, nor I will not denie it, but that by ye comnant that we made on the day that we fought together, he that of vs two should léese his armour, shoulde remaine as ouercome, and be bounde to doe the will of the victor. All you my Lordes doe knowe what chaunced. And althoughe that fortune hath done so little for me, as to take from me that was in hir handes, to giue it you, yet for all that I will not denie you the rest of that, that I doe doe owe you, for doing ye thing otherwise, the stroke at the entry might be attributed to such a fortune, that it shuld redounde to my greater disaduantage, not fulfilling my promise to him, vnto whom I owe it. Also the gods will not suffer it, but rather send death vnto me. For notwithstanding I am but a woman, yet I knowe certainely that neither corde nor naile can so constraine or close the thing that they will fasten it vnto, to holde it stedfast, as faith doth staightly hold a gentle spirit with his line or corde indissoluble. And for this cause (as I haue learned) the olde and auncient painters did paint hir with a white lynnen clothe, declaring thereby the purenesse, which may not nor oughte not to be defyled with anye spotte, or perill, be it neuer so straunge and daungerous. And this is the reason, whereby I submit me wholy to your will, purposing to obey you, so far yet, as my estate and honour shall permit and suffer it. Now therfore aduise you what it pleaseth you, that I shall doe.

                   I thinke there is no princesse, nor no other that hath wel considered our combat, that doth not estéeme the victory that ye giue me, to procéede of youre owne voluntarie will, and not of my force and strength. For (as I haue oftentimes told you) it was you your selfe, that ouercame you and not I. And so this glory that ye attribute vnto me, doth retourne to you, and it is reason that it be associated with your good and entier libertie, without any order apointed by me otherwise than it shall please you. Ye haue it then, and enioy it as before, requiring of you no other recompence, for the seruice and goodnesse that I desire and wish you, but that we may continue friends: assuring you madame, that of my part I (as concerning you) as long as I liue shall be no nother, what euil or displeasure so euer it be that ye haue purchased and sought for me.
            
            
               Esclariana the Empresse of Rome (comming to king Amadis) doth shew him in few words, how that Florestan deliuered hir out of the hands of the Pyrats, and in recompence thereof, she demaundeth him to hir husband and spouse. In the 8. booke the .52. Chapter.
               I Beléeue that few of you (most excellēt princes) be ignorāt of the cruell death of the Emperoure of Rome Arquisill, and of his sonne the Prince of Inerpie, by the occasion wherof, the emperiall crowne by the right of successiō perteineth to me. And yet that notwithstanding fortune not being cōtent with the iniurie & inhumanitie committed by those that touch me very nigh, assaied after yt to giue me yet another charge very euil to disgest. That was, that the Empresse my déere & dolorous mother, beléeuing to saue me from the tyrants & the vsurpers of my goodes, brought me by sea into a place, where that not only I and she fell almost into the perill of léesing our liues, but of our honor it selfe, with the greatest shame yt euer chaunced to any poore lady, or vnfortunate damsel.

               Amadis doth answer Esclariane, and doth accord to hir demād. In the .8. booke the .52. Chapter.
               IN good fayth my niece (quoth king Amadis) Florestan my nephewe is the sonne of a good father, and he himselfe a knight of so great merit, that ye could not appointe you in no place better. And I greatly thanke you, that ye loue him, and him also, that he hath shewed him selfe so curteous, and so ready to serue you, as he hath done. Ye require him of me for your husband, & I agrée vnto your request, & pray you both, that it may be done euen now, without any further delay.
            
            
               Amadis of Greece taketh paine to perswade Abra, that she shuld take in good part the thing that the Gods do send hir, and to hope for better in time to come. Afterwardes he prayeth hir to pardon Lisuard, seing also that he with his honoure is come foorth from all the combats and perilles that she had prepared for him. In the .8. booke the .53. Chapter.
               MAdame, I beséech you (vsing your wisedome) to take in good part such things as are sent you after the will and mind of Iupiter, vnto whome we must obey without murmuring. And whereas ye may commaund your selfe, and folow this counsell, fortune being prompt and noisome, may chance to turne hir wheele, and ye shal come at the last to the thing that ye if ye be gouerned by reason, most desire. For otherwise

neither you, nor the Gods shoulde desire it, nor it should not be graunted you by our Gods, the which are iust, and of whome doth hang the selfe iustice. And to the end madame, that ye should not estéeme me to speake without reason, ye know that to ouercome himselfe, is a worke that holdeth more of the heauens, than of humanitie: and yet it is eas

                  t then I pray you, this heauinesse, the which cānot but anoy you, & trouble you, and reioycing your selfe in your troubles, take ye things, not at the worst, but to the best, as much as ye may possible. For it is a comely thing to do, yea and at al times, when one hath occasion to shew the vertue that man hath in himselfe. Neuerthelesse I perceiue very well, that seing your deliberations are cleane turned, it is vnto you a despite and a displeasure that cannot be borne. But what? ye cannot then cō
                  maund destinies, nor stay the course of the least planet of Heauen. Seing then that the will of the Gods is such, will ye striue against them? They haue suffered the death of youre brother; they haile conserued and kept my father, they wyll frustrate you of your enterprises, & fauor his: will ye breake the ele with your knée? For Gods sake (madame) forget the remembrance of the euill that ye desire & wish him, and doe so, that he may so much remayne yours, as ye of your parte are his but little, I am sure that with his amitie, ye shall get more laude and praise, than by the pursute that ye make to anoy him. Ye haue séene how he hath despatched him of the combats and strifes ye prepared for him, ye haue caused hys forces to be experimented and proued by me and other, the issue whereof hath bin such, that ye should do your self wrōg, if ye giue not place to reason, hauing so many ways purchased the vengeance of the death of Zair, whereof ye haue had so little fruite, that euen that thing alone ought from hencefoorth to mortifye both your payne, & much more your pursute, thinking to haue reason.
            
            
               
               Abra doth answer, that notwithstanding the counsell that Amadis of Greece gaue hir be right, yet it is impossible for hir (although the Gods would it) to accomplish it: to this ende that she will purchace the death of Lisuard as much as she can or may. In the .8. booke the .53. Chapter.
               TRuly (Lord Amadis) ye are not out of purpose, to say that ye haue said vnto me: also it is easy for him that is whole to counsel the sick. And neuerthelesse, euen as many (during the grosse feuer) do find the tast of water better, thā the hope of life: so will I wel confesse, that notwithstanding the thing that ye counsell me be right and according to equitie, yet it hath no liuely part in me, nor disposeth me not to follow this good aduise. And although I should féele some goodnesse, yet I promis you I would sooner take payne to roote it out, than to kéepe it in my heart, being so resolued in the enmitie of Lisuard, that if I cannot cause him to leese his life, he shall die as I may. And forasmuch as all my euill and hope lyeth there, I haue by this poynt begon to complayne me, and to answer you, not by the entraunce of the purpose and communication ye held me. But by the end that ye made, and yet with the time, I shall well satisfye both the one and the other. Ye say that it would wel become me, and that I shuld and must obey without murmure to the will of the Gods. As touching that, I promis you that they may sooner depriue me of my life, than they may take that from my vnderstanding, that is imprinted & better grauen than euer was any writing vpō copper or white marble. Therfore from hencefoorth iudge my stedfastnes & cōstācie such, as I surely paint it vnto you. It is true that I am not ignorāt (as ye haue put me in remembrance) that I cannot cōmand nother superior things nor fortune hir selfe. And yet I know very well, that hir wheele being mouable, (as ye certenly haue told me) that she may turne some day, & to be as gentle to me, as she hathe bene contrarye. Then I maye play another personage,

and such a one, that the vniust death of my brother may be reuenged, & my self content, & no sooner. In the meane while, I wil not breake ye éele with my knée, but desire only to employ the forces of my bodie, and of my spirite and minde, to satisfie my intention. Alas, at the beginning I sawe and had his acquaintance, that hath afterwardes so greatly offended me. I would neuer haue estéemed, that of so great loue, there might haue come forth so great and perfit hatred. I loued him more than my self, I sought his alliance, more than any other mans that liueth or shal liue: and now I hate him more than death, and I will pursue his ruine more than my proper health: praying you (Lord Amadis) for a resolution, séeing that complaints cannot resuscitate and reuiue the dead, and that vengeance doth somewhat discharge the heart, neuer to speake more to me of him, for his name, and the remembrance that I haue of him is so odious, that I as oft as he presenteth him to my spirite, suffer but too much ruine. For this cause it is certaine, that as long as I shall haue life or meanes, his life shall not remaine in safegarde. For if it continue long, yet shall I cause him either to be slaine, or to be destroyed, yea and yée your selues should shew your strength to dispatch him.
            
            
               The Damsell that deceytfully had brought Lisuarde, Amadis of Grece, and Gradafilea (after that hir embushment was discouered by Queene Zahara, and she brought to prison to Trebisonde) doth recite the maner and cause of the treason, afterwardes she requireth, that if they will shew hir no mercie, to put hir shortly to death.
               ALas my Lordes, men say commonly, that the most shortest follies are best, and that it is much better to assure one vengeance appoynted with long deliberation & meanes, than to hast it without consideration of the daungerous issue that might chaunce, whereby shame encreaseth to him, that thought to quench and to suage it. The which thing may now

be proued by the misfortune that is chanced to my soueraigne Lorde the King of Crete: for he thinking to reuenge the death of Sulpice and his brethren, the whiche Lisuarde, Pirion, and Olorius put to death, hath lost his owne. And he was the first that this inuincible Quéene destroyed with ye stroke of an arrow. But he with too little consideration began to reuenge the iniurie, yt he promised him was done by whome I spake vnto you, (without finding of any proper occasion after hys owne mind) vntil one day among other, knowing me to be craftie & malicious, as I am, he declared vnto me what he thought, praying me on my part to giue him coūsell. The which thing I promised him to do, and when I was aduertised of the great assemble and méeting that they made here, I purposed my enterprise such as ye shall vnderstande. This it was, that I coū
                  selled him to sende me towards you with feyned swordes, and so forged, that they shoulde breake euen at the first stroke that they should be occupied. And bicause I would forget nothing, I led these two dwarfes with me, so wel appoynted, that they should assay the speares of the two knightes, yt which I should deliuer them at the tilte, and to leaue them assoone as they should sée them redie to enter in, as they could do ful wel. The thréed whereof I spake vnto you, was the ambush where my king was present with his brother, & ten other knights, that incōtinent should assaile my pigeons, I cal them my pigeons, whom I purpose to take and deceyue vnder the shadow of pitie, the which I di
                     •
                  guised vnto them in your presence, so that all the purpose that I spake vnto you of yesterday, was false and only inuented and found to take either king Amadis, the Emperor, Esplandian, or some other of their linage, as it shuld happely haue come to passe, if that fortune, or (to speak better) the soueraine Gods had not willed the contrarie. For the king of Crete willing to make sure his enterprise, had brought with him aboue a thousand chosen knights, the which I cannot tell by what Amazones, were hewed in péeces, of whō they doubted but little. Nor they would neuer haue cared for it, if it had

not béene for the report that was brought them by his sp
                     •
                  es, the which the king had ordinarily in this towne. But what is become of them, I cannot say, but I will say vnto you, that if our purpose had taken place, the will of the king was such, that he woulde haue caused two knightes, the which I had brought from hence to haue past ouer the sea, to assay & proue to haue woonne through their puisance, the Castell of Rocke, and Lica, not long ago vsurped vpon king Muton his brother, and then to haue cut off their heades, and haue sent them vnto you. As touching the rest of the fortune, ye knowe it as well as I
                     •
                   therefore I will holde my peace, praying you, if ye enuie to preferre mercie aboue my faulte, to giue mée the shortest and readiest death that ye may possible, the whiche shall well content me, séeing that my Lorde and Prince is departed and dead.

Also the other Gods haue had (as me thinketh) great wrong to suffer you to haue some iurisdiction and power, to vse it so as ye continue: séeing that the propertie of a God is goodnesse, iustice, mansuetude, pitie, liberalitie, and amitie, wherewith he recompenseth his seruantes, and ye your ministers cleane contrarie. And seing it is so, how can ye excuse you, or cause any reasonable persō to find your vniustice & cruelnesse good, that ye haue vsed against my brother? or with what armes can ye honor and adorne your triumph, that a C. times in a day hath giuen me death, not to haue power, and to be

able to die. But alas, what doe I say? to whom doe I speake? or why will I thus contestate or enter into reason with him that hath none? Cer

But alas, where is now this promise so oftentymes sworne, and those feigned teares, that you Amadis to intrappe me, hath so oftentymes shed vpon your face in my presence? Ah, ah, ye euill man, one day ye reputed me for a Venus, that rested (as ye assured me) in your heart: but now the poyson being manifest, I sée clearely that she is the Venus that ye auauan
                     •
                  ed you of. The which thing shall cause me as long as you shall liue to estéeme you slouthfull and vnfortunate, to haue taken so great paine and pleasure to deceyue me. Therefore all thing truely and well considered, ye should (as me thinketh) haue a respect, that I being the daughter (as I am) of so great a king, deserued to be otherwayes entreated of you, and not with such mockes as ye haue drest me withall. But I vnderstand full well, that as yet ye will take a glorie, whereof I shall complaine me for euer of you, and of the loue which I nowe abhorre more than euer I had it in reuerence. For as there is no pleasure that can bée made equall with the perfite amitie of two louers, so there is no hatred or impacience, that can more trouble the spirit than iust iealousie, without whiche, all other martyrdome that

mingleth it selfe with the swéetenesse of loue, is not (as mée thinketh) but a multiplication of loue, and a true inticement wherewith she vtterly destroyeth hir selfe. An extréeme brought or thyrst, causeth water to be the better accepted, and long fasting giueth meate a better taste. Also the goodnesse of peace and rest of the minde, cannot be sounde nor estéemed of him, that hath not experimented the strong, cruell, and hard warre that suspicion doth make. The absence of a friende is sometimes well supported and borne withall, for the hope of a newe ioy at his returne: And one excuse, one disdaine, one refuse, one euill looke, one light miscontentation: but after that hypocrisie and falsnesse is knowne to be in the heart that one estéemed faythfull, it is moste certaine, that there is no martyrdome, nor no displeasure that tormenteth a man more than where fayth and true amitie make their habitation. Alas my Amadis, founde ye euer in me any other thing than affection and good will towarde you? Did I euer thing were it neuer so little, to cause you to be miscontent? By my God, ye doe me wrong.

But the euil houre succéeded so, that the Souldan frustrated of his intentiō lost his life, as it is manifest to euery man. Therefore my Lordes, there is not one of you, vnto whome such an iniurie doth not redounde, your Prince being so euill entreated, and finally slaine, and with his hande whom I my selfe had chosen and elected for my Lorde and spouse. Truely the loue that I bare him, hath béene euill recompensed, plucking

out the bloud out of the bellie of so noble a Prince of the Babilonians, and of an infinite of other your friendes, parents and kinsfolke. And in such a sort, that if you well considered how all is past, it shall be founde, that either your fathers, or your brothers, or your cousins in particular and general haue béene meate vnto the monsters of the sea, their bodies being depriued of all honourable sepulture, and buried among the waters of the déepe Abismes. Shall this iniurie be forgotten at any time? Shall the name of Babilon be made a fable vnto all those that shall heare men speake of their mischiefe? Shall the iust vēgeance be ended without doing of any other thing? Ah ah, ye stoute Kings, I adiure you by our high and mightie Gods, that euerie one of you take his armure, not onely to cause it to be knowne throughout all the worlde, that ye be the dominators of all Princes that doth offende you, but the scourge and chastisement of all nations. The Christians (as it is reported to me) do assemble themselues, & cause a brute that they will come and finde vs, and chasing vs out of our proper heritages, proclaime Axiane the sonne of Zirphee, Emperour of this Monarch. But if ye will beleeue me, we shall set them farre from their accountes, and go to preuent them and to set them forwards, entring into the Empyre of Trebisonde, the which being sacked and destroyed, we shall passe on to Constantinople, where that fire, and the edge of our swordes shal be the executours of our vengeance, sparing neither king nor man, woman nor childe, being assured that if ye woulde set forth your ensignes and banners in the fielde, that they should resist vs no more, than straw agaynst fire. And this is the cause (Princes most excellent) why I sent for you, praying and commaunding you, that in most greatest, and most extréeme diligence ye may possible, to cause the Drumme to sound throughout all your Countreyes, and to assemble both horsemenn and footemen, Galies, Ships, and other vessels, as wel for warre, as to carie vittayles, that we, our preparation being readie, may finish and ende the rest of our enterprise so,

as I haue tolde you, the which thing shall be vnto you verie honourable and profitable. In the meane while I will sende to my friends and allies, requiring and warning them to be fauourable vnto vs, and to ayde vs, considering that this déed and matter, for the reason and cause that I haue declared vnto you, doth touch them, the Christians being willing to inuade as well theyr Countrey as this here, if we will indure and suffer it.

               MY Lorde, the loue that I beare you is so perfite, that vneasily I may giue you councell that shoulde be sounde, and to me agréeable in this that ye demaund: but yet greater is the force of your honour and renowne, séeing that it hath béene the onely meane of the goodnesse that we haue the one of the other. And for this cause ensuing and following reason, and considering that no Emperour nor King shoulde make himselfe subiect (if it were possible) nor pay any tribute, I thinke that you and I ought to neglect and forsake our pleasures, & to haue a respect to the thing that beséemeth you, for the conseruation of you, and of your estate. Therefore I giue you (if I shoulde so speake) all the leaue that shall please you, although that in veritie and truth, it be due, agaynst my will, estéeming and holding it great glorie, thus to captiuate my selfe, to permit & suffer you to haue such libertie, by the which ye shall execute and cause to be knowne more and more the excellencie of your valiantnesse and high cheualrie.

haue my life? a hundred & a hundred times thou hast drawne me from the place where I had forsaken thée: and yet for all that thou hast taken fro me, to cause me to die a hundred tymes vpon a day, my deare wife and spouse, and hast by this euill houre and chaunce, brought vnto me all the other that thou hast reserued and kept for me. O God, God eternall, alas my friend, my wife, and my faythfull companion, ye are (all things considered) wel at ease, liuing in heauen, and I remayning and dwelling among such and so great melancolies and heauinesses. Pardon me I pray you, if I lament & wéepe for you too vndiscretely. This is not for the good chaunce that ye haue, but for sorrow that I do not follow you and accompanie you in your

Thinke ye to reuiue my Ladie againe by wéeping, or thus tormenting your selfe? she is certainly very fortunate and happie, wherefore then do you lament hir so greatly?

                  ABra the Empresse of the Babilonians, Princesse of the Parthes, and commaunding thréescore kings my vassalles, gréeteth you Lisuard of Greece, Emperor of Trebisond, halower of the waters of the Sea, with the royal bloud of Zair my very honorable Lord and brother: Ye shall vnderstand noble prince, that yesterday very lately, I knew of the visitation that fortune hath made you, by the death of your dere spouse, and of your onely sonne Amadis of Greece, whereof (I promis you) I was greatly displeased. For notwithstāding that the obligatiō that I haue to the iust vengeance of him, of whom I am sole inheriter, and to the wrong as ye know, that you your selfe did me, do greatly constrayne me to hate you to death, yet cruell loue that doth dayly vndermind my heauie heart to loue you but too much, will not suffer it to consent to the ruine and destruction that I haue prepared for you. The whiche truly doth cause me to name you, and that of right, a louer and a friend of the high Gods, the whiche haue founde (and thought it good to proue your courage and extreame constancie) not onely by the strength of manye a braue man, and beastes more cruell, the whiche ye haue conquered and tamed: but also with the rodde of their might and supreme power, they haue punished you with so hard and gréeuous persecutiō, that I being your enimie, as I am, haue felt it in my soule, so that I wept with both my eyes, iudging thereby, what that dolour and heauinesse might be, that ye suffered for the losse of your wife and louer so déere, and your only sonne so commēdable. And yet being true (as it is true indéede) that the consolation of the vnfortunate, is to find their like. Yet ye haue some occasion to moderate this greate anoyance by that, that I beare euen such another (or there lacketh very little) as yours is. Ye haue lost (as men say, your wife, and I could neuer recouer him, whome I only merited to haue to my Lord & husband, that is your selfe, that hath made me oftentimes maruell, howe it was possible, that so great amitie might conceiue in heart so great

hatred, where such conformitie ought to be represented. And yet if ye way all things well, the time present doth shew you him, whome ye ought to folow in time to come. And that it is so, ye sée the end, wherevnto your great prosperities haue brought you. The heauens are not alwayes in one being, nor Lisuard also ought not to be continually victorious, nor Abra alwayes ouercomde by him. What then? must I sorrow and be heauy for the mischance that maketh and aduanceth at the sight of the eye a better fortune than I may wish for, and that doth promis me a sure recompence of the loue that I haue nourished so long in my soule, yea and vntill he put him into my hands that so cruelly, and by so many long dayes hath illuminated and inflamed my heart, the which I already haue almost distild in the fire of Ielously. Truly all things well considered, it séemeth Lisuard, that the time approcheth, in the which I may execute vpō you the vengeāce that ye haue merited, finishing my anguishes and the hatred that I beare you, by the augmentation and increacement of loue, the Gods giuing you the knowledge of the euill that ye haue done me, with the will to aske me pardon, and me to graunt it you. Therefore I counsel you to preuent the time, and sooner to beléeue my aduice, than your owne opinatiue will, knowing the forces that I haue so nigh vnto you, and well minded to do you more harme, than I desire ye shoulde haue.

               MAdame, I haue presently receyued your letter that it pleased you to write vnto me, and by ye same ye do certifye me of the trouble and anoyance that ye felt for the vnfortunable

chance that happened to my dere companion and spouse, to my sonne Amadis, and principally to my selfe, for the loue of them. For the which I cannot sufficiently thanke you: assuring you, that I estéemed no otherwise of your honestie, knowing it to be no lesse accompanied with clemencie, swéetenesse, and naturall goodnesse, thā with vertue, prudēcie, and kingly nouriture. Yet for al this, I at the first was astonied how it might be possible, that ye shoulde iudge me fortunate, to be thus touched as I am, with the rodde of God, and to haue lost so much, if it were not for this, that I hope to haue for my pacience a reward in another life. And moreouer I do maruell of this, that ye mainteine and compare your losses to mine, vnto the which (vnder your correction) there is no similitude at all. For I haue lost my Lady, and my louer, and ye haue yet in me a seruant well affectioned, and shall be (as touching you) all his life, (the honor and duetie of the estate reserued, as it ought to be) and in such sorte, that notwithstanding the greate enmities that ye haue against him, he will assay and inforce himselfe to obey, honor, and serue you. Trusting so much in the goodnesse of God, that promptly and within a short season my iustice shall be knowen, and youre wrong made manifest, reproued, and of your owne proper conscience finished. Ye furthermore write vnto me, that the tyme dothe approch, that fortune shall deliuer me into your handes, in recompence of the paynes that ye haue suffered in louing me to much. I know not why ye should hope so, for the thing that ye haue already: for I sweare vnto you by the God of heauen and of the earth, that there is not a gentleman in all the world that is more yours, and more at youre commaundement than I am, or that loueth you so muche or more. The whiche thyng ye shall knowe, where and when it shall please you to commaunde me, aduising you for the rest, not to trust so much in fortune, as ye séeme to doe.

One good thing I haue, that the threatning that ye about the latter end of your letter do threaten me withal, doth so much assure me, that I feare a great deale more the swéete casting of your swéete eyes, than the fury of all your souldiers togither, kissing for the rest the handes of youre highnesse, euen the same that desireth to haue a right good part in your good grace, the which is, and shall remayne for euer your auncient and perpetuall friende, neighbour and seruant Lisuard.

For as muche as we be so nigh of kinne, the whyche kinred and amitie ought to be so much our familiar, as hatred is our domestike and neighbour, but seing that our soueraigne iudge would not suffer our possession to be taken but by the price and sheading of manye mens bloud, we doe signifye and denounce vnto you the battell within these four days, and in the campe & féeld where we be. And for our iudges he alone, whome we Christians do adore in trinitie of

persons, God omnipotent, the first and the last of all things, the which shall giue, if it so please him, for ye suertie of yours and ours, the rigorous iustice of his eternitie, and for the equall compartment of the sunne, the night, or the victory. As touching our harneis, ye haue them in your hand, and caused them to be taken of our own vassalles and subiects, so vniustly, that the men, the earth, and the waters do crie vengeance alreadie, the which God will not denie them, as their bloud being shed shall beare witnesse.

In the meane space let there be a truce betwéen you and vs, for these foure dayes as ye haue required, the whyche as touching our parte we promise you in the faythe of a Princesse to obserue, withoute breaking them by anye meanes.

               AH, ah, fortune, fortune, thou hast pursued me so much that the spoyle of me and of my goods from henceforthe shall serue thée for a triumphe, fortune enimie of all vertuous persons. O troublous ingrate, and accursed fortune, the which to deceiue & abuse me, didst promise, not only the Empire & Monarchie of all the Orient, but the frée or the enforced enioying of my Lisuard. Alas he was neuer mine, althoughe I haue deserued him more thā any other that euer was borne. And yet so muche there lacketh that such merite hath taken place, that he hath destroyed me both of goods and of honour, but not of the honour that all ladies should prefer aboue life, but of the honour and victorie that he hath conquered vpon my heauie vassalls, being all dead, or slaues. Ah, ah Lisuard, what recompence or degrée of amitie is so stedfast and constant, as that I all my life haue borne thée? Alas, if ye haue béen in doubt in time past, I beseche mightie Iupiter, that the death, which I féele doth approch, may giue you sure witnes: for I protest, yt I die not for any heauinesse yt I haue of any losse either of men, of reputation, or of goods: but onely that I haue no hope hereafter to haue any thing of you: estéeming that this glorious victorie hath so pufte vp your heart, that disdaining your Abra, ye shall nor will not receiue hir for the least of your slaues.

               MY Lord I beséech you most humbly, soner than to blame my absence to take the paine (if it please you) to read this

my letter, and reading it to consider in your selfe, with what mighte and power loue is accustomed to cause them to obey him, that are in his rule and dominion. And willing to exercise it in mée, he presented long since, before the eyes of my spirite, not onely the renoume of the valiant and inuincible Amadis of Greece but also his beautie, dexteritie, and good grace, for the whiche he is commended of all men, that haue had the chaunce to sée him and to frequent him. And for this cause I set my loue and affection so to him wardes, that I was readie to die: also he was sorie that I coulde lyue without the meane that I founde oute to giue him knowledge not once, but more than twice, of the payne that I endured for the great desire that I had to him, whereof he onely had compassion. For loue it selfe was so gentle vnto me, that he wounded him with the like shotte, that he hurted me, making him so muche myne, that vnder the fayned habite of Nereide the slaue, he came to this your Courte, where that afterwards he had the combat with the vsurper of his name and of his figure: what the ende thereof was, my Lorde, ye knowe sufficiently inoughe. So much there is, that within a while after, the houre and time was giuen me to knowe him. And we agréed so well, and so accorded our intentions togither, that finally we were maried, the which if it be your pleasure, ye shall not take in yll parte, his person beyng of suche merite, for why his valiantnesse and the noble bloud whereof he is descended, séemed onely worthy of my beautie, and Trebisonde more méete for the celebration of our mariage, than your towne Niquea, bicause of so many Emperors, Kings, Princes, and highe Ladies as he and I truste to finde there. And for this cause and occasion, we bring in these vessels ye excellēt Quéene of Caucase, by whose meanes our enterprise toke place. Nor I will not denie that I haue offended you: but I trust so much in your fatherly goodnesse, yt forgotting my faulte, & considering to whom I haue vowed

my selfe, ye will pardon me, the which thing I require of you with all reuerence. Your most humble and most obedient daughter Niquea.

And for this cause we goe presently towards the Emperour my father, that shall receiue my lady your daughter so well, that it shall be a pleasure for you to vnderstande it, and to me a sure contentation.

And to come to this, after long and ripe deliberation of counsel, we are of this aduice & mind, and do ordeine, that you madame Abra, shall leaue to my Lady Axiana the Empyre of Babilon euen as she and Zarafiell, of good and famous memorie held it and possest it, and that ye should peasably enioy al the rest, notwithstanding it was conquered by the vertuous and sage Prince Zair, or any otherwise.

And to the intent (quoth he to Abra) the yōg infants and princes which haue accompanied you, may be partakers of the pleasure of this amitie and confederation, we wil marrie them worthily, and so, that they shal haue great occasion to thanke vs. And this for a resolutiō of that, that we toke deliberation of to certifye you, and to declare in so high and to so great assemblie, praying you both to find oure aduice and counselll good, and as it is reasonable, for the wealth and highnesse of the one and the other to follow it. For as concerning vs, we wyll holde vs onely to the honoure that it hathe pleased GOD to graunte vs, withoute vsurping or taking of any thyng vpon those that

are ouercome, whether it be by raunsome in money, in lands or possessions.

And yet that notwithstanding, it séemeth to me very conuenient, to answer you somewhat to the thing that ye accuse me of, demaunding by the discourse of your letter, if as yet I be the self same man of whome the renoume hath left his marke of glorie, both in the East, and in the West. I ensure you Madame, that I am euen he himselfe, the which vnder your fauour, and through the desert and merite of the excellencie of your beautie, hath at sometimes obteyned the renowme of valiantnesse and chiualrie, through the merite (I say) of you, for withoute the continuall remembrance of your presence, that then did accompanie me.

Therefore I beseech you most humbly, not to put me in any fault, and to thinke that assoone as I may haue the ways and meane to come to you, there shall be no fault nor let, but that I will come, the which thing I trust surely to do, when I depart from hence, where I am constrayned by promisse to remayne for a time, as Darinell thys present bearer maye shewe you, whome ye knowe to be faythfull and secret, the whych shall let me at this time to write any longer letters,

               LOrd Dom Florisell, I haue receiued the letter, that it hath pleased you to write me by Darinell, the whiche hath certified me of a great part of the aduentures that haue chanced vnto you, since ye departed out of this conntrey, and therwith of the enterprise that ye haue done in kéeping the toure of Vniuerse for a certaine time, the which I desire to be shortly acc

                  mplished, that ye might shortly come hither, to gyue consolation vnto my féeble spirite, the which hath bin continually in wrapped (since your absence) in melancolie & heauinesse. Alas how oftentimes haue I bene at a point to put my selfe in ieopardy to recouer you? Certenly if I coulde haue founde any good meane to haue come thether where ye were, be you assured I woulde not haue shewed my selfe slouthfull to haue departed, nor the honoure nor reuerence that I owe vnto my father shoulde haue turned me, and the fayth much lesse that I haue promised to Dom Lucidor, the whiche by my consente shall neuer haue anye part in me, for the extreame loue and affection that I beare you cannot suffer it. Consider therefore my déere friende the thyng that I doe in your fauor, and be not vnthankfull

to acknowledge it, as I do not mistrust you, considering the purpose that ye make me by your letters, and the thing that Darinell hath told me, praying you in the meane season, to kéepe secret the loue that is betwéene vs two, and to be a faithfull kéeper of my honor, considering that fortune shall shew hir selfe to you and me hereafter more fauorable, than she hath done in time past. And in this hope I shall pray the creator to giue vs grace to come to our affectionate desire, after that I haue presented my most humble recommendations vnto your good remembrance: of the whiche my cousin Timbria doth desire to be partaker. Your perfect louer Helen of Apolonia.
               
            
            
               The Prince Anaxartes by letters doth shew fayre Oriana the loue that he dothe beare hir, and so doing he forgetteth not to prayse hymselfe. In the .9. booke the .64. Chapter.
               RIght excellent princesse, the diuine Anaxartes, the sonne of Mars God of battels, doth giue you such salutations as he desireth for himselfe. Madame the wound and dolour that I haue receiued by the regard and sighte of your excellente beautie, is so great and so vehement, that it hath not onely subdued my naturall force and strength, that my glorious mother Zahara Quéene of Caucase hath giuen 
                     •
                  e, but also they haue so féeblished my diuine vertue (whereof I take part of my fathers side) that I am cōs
                     •
                  rayned to draw vnto you to haue health & remedie for my wound: for euen as they y• be pricked & stinged with a Scorpion do vse to take remedie of thē, likewise seing that ye haue bin the cause of ye euill that I suffer, I search remedie of you, the which ye shuld not denie me, considering the place of my birth, and the power that the mightie Gods haue giuen me, of the which the most part of them haue bin smitten with the dartes of loue, as I am at this present, and so that by no meanes I can resist it.

And therefore madame, do not wonder, seeing me to be partaker of the diuinitie, that my heart is kindled with youre loue, for they which are entierly diuines, may be as well taken as I. This Infant (whome I pray you receiue as hys highnesse doth merit) may shew you by mouth, the torment and anoyance that I am in. Thus I pray you not to denie me your comfort, the which I aske not but with an honest intention, the which is of one true and perpetuall alliance of vs two. And in thys hope I will pray the Almightie to gyue you his grace, presenting my most humble recommendations to yours. He that cannot be long without your succour, the diuine Anaxartes.
               
            
            
               Letters from prince Anaxartes to the Infant Oriana, cōtinuing (notwithstanding hir answer) the burning affection that he doth beare hir, and aduertising hir of the daunger into the which he may fall, if she refuse him. In the .9. booke the .65. Chapter.
               RIght vertuous Princesse, I perceyuing the answer that ye haue made to the Infant Artimire, by whome I sente you my letters, I know that ye find it nother good nor decent that I haue apointed my selfe to come to you, for the reason mētioned in them, that is, bicause ye are vnder the power of your father and mother, vnto whome ye will obey, and do nothing but their pleasure, the which thing I agrée with you to be reasonable and honest to all persons, be they neuer so high and noble, but if ye knew what power this little God of loue hath vpō men (I wil say also vpon the diuines) I am assured ye shuld not haue found my humble request so strange, for your highnes would haue cōsidered that he doth so blinde men, that who so it pleaseth him to smite with his golden dart, he for the most part and most often, taketh frō them all discretion, as we haue infinite examples by the histories, the which at the present I will not recite (fearing to trouble you

               Letters of the Infant Helen to the King of Apolonia hir father, by the which she dothe praye him to excuse hir that she is maried without his leaue, seyng that the destination woulde so haue it, and that the Prince that she hath taken, hath deserued much more. In the .9. booke the .70. Chapter.
               SYr, your most humble daughter Helen doth pray you or euer ye reade these letters at length, to consider what power loue hath evpon men, otherwise ye woulde Iudge the fault that I haue committed against your goodnesse, greater than it is

I thinke that ye do it for the best, to kéepe me farre off from amorous affections, separating me from your court, and to set mée in this solitarie place with my Aunte and my cousin Tymbria of Boetia: but I ensure you that loue hath so assayled me, representing to me in fans

hereof is witnesse my cousin Tymbria, the which hath kepte me companie, fearing that ye would haue giuen hir some euill countenance, she presenteth hir humble recommendations vnto your good grace, & prayeth you, & I also (asmuche as I may possible,) to excuse hir vnto my Lorde hir father, assuring you, that she is not ye cause of the thing that I haue done, but contrariwise, resisted it with all hir power, but ye know syr, that no wisedome, nor yet no humaine force nor strength can resiste the fatals destinies. Thorefore syr, ye ought to beléeue suerly that it was the will of God, nor ye can not say that I haue offended my honour, nor yet yours, taking an husbande not agreable vnto my highnesse, for he whome I haue chosen, doth merite one of a greater stocke than I am, for the goodnesse that he doth possesse, aswell of fortune, as of the spirite, yea a great deale more than the Prince Lucidor, vnto whom I pray you to excuse me, and to consider that I neuer promised him any thing, so that he néede not be greatly gréeued with me, nor offended with the thing that I haue done, in as muche truely as this hath not béene to disdaine his aliance, for I acknowledge that he did me much honour, willing to take me for such a one, as I am nowe to Dom Florisel of Niquea, the which hath conducted me to Constantinople, accōpanied with Prince Falanges of Astre, a Prince as wise and as valiant, as he is vertuous and of good grace, praying in this behalfe the soueraine creator of al things, to giue you health, good fortune, and long life. Your most humble daughter Helen of Apolinia.
               
            
            
               Prince Lucidor of Vengeances letter to the Infant Alastraxeree, giuing hir knowledge of the iust occasion that he hathe to reuenge him of Dom Florisel, and praying hir not to let him to do it. In the .9. booke the .72. Chapter.
               
                  MAdame, were it not that I thinke that ye haue bene misinformed of the great wrong that Prince Florisel of Niquea hathe done mée, I estéeme that your diuine excellence would not haue béene in battaile against me, to haue lefted the effect of the iust execution of the vengeance that I oughte to take vpon him, as well in my owne name, as vpon the occasion of the iniurie that Amadis of Greece his father hathe done to my sister Lucelle, the which is here with me. But to the ende Madam, that ye may knowe what hath moued me to assaile him in such order, as ye haue séene, ye shall vnderstande that he rauished and ledde away Helen the Infant of Apollonia, the which hath beene promised me of long time, to be my wife, and for such I haue accepted hir and will haue hir. I pray you then to consider how much that thing should gréeue me, and shewe not your selfe to be so great an enimie of your owne highnesse and good renoume, as to let so iust a vengeance, but rather to shewe fauour and ayde to him that foloweth it, thus doyng ye shall obserue and keepe the integritie of your iustice. Thus Madame presenting my humble recommendations to your good grace, I shall pray the soueraine to gyue you the accomplishemente of your desyres. Your cousin and intier good friend Lucidor of Vengeances.
               
            
            
               Alastraxeree dothe answere the letters of Prince Lucidor of Vengeances, and dothe shewe him that she hath done hir duetie in helping Dom Florisel, and doth praye him to be at one with him. In the .9. booke the .72. Chapter.
               EXcellent Prince Lucidor, the diuine Alastraxaree the daughter of the mightie Mars, the God of battells, and of the triumphant Zahara Quéene of the Mount Caucase, and of the mountaines of the Orient, dothe sende you salutation and amitie. Ye shall vnderstande that I haue receiued and read your letter, by the whiche ye complaine greatly that I haue

holpen Dom Florisel of Niquea, by whō ye maintaine that ye haue been greatly and sore offended. For an answere thereof, I pray you to consider, how much I am bounde (as all other Princes ought to be) to fauour and minister iustice to those that haue good right: so it is, that I am no lesse bounde also to acknowledge a good déede and seruice, for I am as muche bound to Dom Florisel as any person may be to any other, & that for many causes, the which to make you vnderstande at this present time, I haue no leysure. And it séemeth to me, that ye should put me in no fault, nor be miscontent with the thing that I haue done in his right: and if I had or this knowen & perceiued your difference, yet my highnesse doth binde me to succour him in suche necessitie as I founde him in, so that ye ought not to procure your vengeance and iustice by inequalitie of force, as I haue séene by experience, but to summon him & aduertise him to repaire the iniurie that ye maintaine he hath done you, and if he refuse to content you, and to make you amendes, then ye should procéede by good counsell and moderate deliberation. Thinke & estéeme therfore, that I haue not done but my dutie to Dom Florisel, nor I will not leaue of to satisfie you, and to maintaine your right euen against him, the thing being well knowen and examined. Yet in the meane space I pray you, that ye will enforce your selfe to agrée and accord your differēce without sheading of bloud i

And in this hope I will make an ende at this time, wherin you and all my lords of your companie shall finde my recommendations to your good graces, beséeching the Gods to maintayne you all in

               A letter from Dom Florisell of Niquea, to the Princesse Arland, excusing him of this, that he cannot beare hir the amitie that he desireth, being in loue in another place. In the .10. booke the .4. Chapter.
               MAdame, the prayses of the warlike victories, published in euery place by the cleare trumpet, séeme to me of little valure, in comparison of him that doth deserue it, the which by wisedome is an ouercommer of himselfe. For of the first, the great part is done to fortune, the which is commō among vs, our Lieutenants and souldiours, on the other, no man may haue any right, but he alone, vnto whom all the honour doth perteyne. The déed alreadie past betwéene you and me, doth summon and inuite you to this conquest of glorie that hath no péere, considering the assaultes, that your owne will doth both day and night deliuer you, the wh

Considering therefore that loue no lesse than other naturall things, doth continually retaine his propertie, the which is to exercise tyrannie agaynst his vassals,

as he did agaynst Quéene Dido, and diuerse great Ladies, the which did sacrifice to this cruell God, with their pure bloud, and at last with theyr lyfe. Take an example, and looke vpon me, to obey his force, as ye sée that I could not resist him, and ye shall winne aboue me (that doth liue in continuall warre) this vauntage, to remaine in peace and quitnesse of spirite: the which I wish you, with the encrease of glorie, prosperitie, with as good an heart, as I doe present these most humble recommendations to your good Grace.

               The Oration of Prince Lucidor, desiring ayde of the King, and Princes Apolloniens, to reuenge him of the Princes of Grece. In the .10. booke the .5. Chapter.
               SIr, and you Princes, Barons, Captaines, and Souldiours Apolloniens, if our sage auncetours, (which the worldes that are past did beare) had left vs in the succession of so many good documents, the certaine knowledge of the traine and gouernment of fortune, hir inconstancie shoulde not giue me at this time occasion to blame hir, nor hir certaintie a lawe to saye this that I say: but forasmuch as she hir selfe hath prescribed the authoritie to execute hir owne minde, the Princes of this worlde shall winne much lesse to will to resist hir might, than to obey and acquite themselues of the obligation that she often tymes doth lay and intangle them withall. Not sir, that I will vnder this colour denie in any poynt that I owe vnto your honour, nor likewise leaue of to exacte of you in iustice that ye owe vnto mine, being disposed to make of two lyke things, one or other, in the case of the rauishment and rape of your daughter Helen, and my spouse. In whome no lesse force hath béene done to you, than to me, the which thing induceth me presently to require that your will conforme it self to mine, for our mutuall satisfaction in the enterprise of this

iust vengeance. Not that I doubt (Lorde Birmates) or haue any mistrust in this case of your franke and noble courage: but feare onely of the councell that may be giuen you to the contrarie, whether it be to turne you wholy, or at the least to slacke your diligence that is required in this businesse, by the occasion of the auncient amitie that ye haue continually with the Princes of Grece, a thing that shoulde turne me to an inestimable losse, if it shoulde be prolonged, séeing that the aray and the furniture, wherevnto ye sée that I am set, the which to me should be vnprofitable, if it be not strengthned and augmented by yours. And therefore sir, and ye Princes, Barons, Capitaynes and souldiours Apolloniens ought not to maruell, that I so vrgently doe solicite you to this enterprise, and lesse to refuse my request being of such consequence for you, that thinking to reiect it as mine, ye shall finde it as muche contrarie to your selues. Who is he that can say that this outrage hath not béene done as much to you as to me? As touching my part, I am disposed to vengeance, in the which if I do not content my desire in the satisfaction of my honour, in as much as Fortune is not content, I will turne vpon my selfe the rest of the force and strength, not as a subiect to serue hir any more in any newe crueltie. For this cause Sir, and you other Lordes Apolloniens, I pray you moste humblie and verie effectuously, that ye will in this behalfe employe and shewe your force and strength, and the strength of youre friendes and allyes to be ioyned vnto mine, to appoynt and prepare such a power and might agaynst the Princes Constantines, that if willingly they will not make amendes for this wrong and iniurie, we may be sufficient to execute the thing vpon them, and to enforce them to reason. Here I make ende of my demaunde, not dooing it after my first intention, whether it be as concerning the vengeance to giue, or to take.

of the variable and wauering Goddesse hath oftentimes néede of helpe. The Princes of Greece had good right against the citie of Troy, the whiche, that notwithstanding, did sustaine their siege and assaulte the space of tenne yéere, and had sustayned it peraduenture vnto the ende, sauing for the treason so craftily pretensed, and so valiantly executed. But lette vs leaue a parte the great effusion of bloud that I sée prepared: let vs onely consider what issue it shall haue: for in very déede, the effect of armes is almost vpō fortune, nor neuer grounde in any suretis, therfore we must descende specially to the conseruation of our honour. Touching the which (notwithstanding that it hath bene offended by ye taking away of Helen) it may be that greater reason shalbe shewed vs, for the satisfactiō of our iniurie than we hope, after that the partie shall haue well perceyued, and discussed the grounde of our complaint. Upon the which men can giue no lawfull iudgement, before they heare the deduction of both parties. Therefore let vs take héede to procéede by ripe deliberation, fearing least we repent vs to much by leasure of our foolish precipitation and hastinesse: for this cause we are thus minded my Lord Lucidor, that or euer ye procéede any further, ye should shew your minde and intention by writing to Prince Florisel, summoning him for the reparation of the outrageous iniurie, for through his refuse, ye shall make our cause a great deale the better. Thē without any difficultie ye may denounce mortall warre with fire and bloud, vnto the accomplishment and fulfilling of the vengeaunce: and as concerning the combat of your person with his, I am not of that opinion, for asmuch as the déede of so generall offence, should not be charged nor layde vpon the shoulders of any one slone, the whiche lesing, the rest of the pursute, should as touching other remayne without amenyment. Not that I will in this reuoke in any doubte the valure of your person,

In the meane space not to require, nor yet to put our fréendes to payne (of whome we shoulde desire succour in these affayres) vntill we may shew them more than dutie, vnto whome wée shalbe sent to search for peace, and to auoyde the horrible furie of the warre: the whiche thing shall furthermore encourage them to take armour and to fight for vs, against a common enimie, for right, equitie, peace, and quietnesse of the people, b

                  e, ought to employ our common forces and strength against the Infidels. I desire greatly to know, what excuse ye shall sinde for the great wrong that yée haue done me, and to your

selfe (as I may say) in violating my Kingly estate, and likewise the amitie that ye owe to the father of my spouse, praying you that ye will wryte it vnto me by parcell meanes, to the ende I may consider that it be sufficient to accomplish the satisfaction on your parte in my behalfe: for if I with your good will cannot haue it, I must be constrayned to take it with the edge of the sworde, by the way of armes, betwene you and me onely, vnto the vtterance of your life or mine. I maruell me much, that your vertue so wel knowen here in so glorious actes, is so forgetfull through a disorbinate appetite of vnbrideled youth, to declare it selfe so great an enimie of reason, specially of the peace inuiolable, that your Fathers and predecessours haue alwaies entertained with the parēts of my spouse, assuring you, that with great payne ye shall washe you of so great a spotte, with all the water of the Sea, for your estate was bounde to resist this vile acte, nor doing the thing that ye would not that he, that is of your qualitie should doe to you, of 
                     •
                  he which ye cannot discharge you neither to God nor man. By the meanes whereof, although I had good right to make warre vpon you, as a defiler of my wife, and of hir owne proper fayth, so it is yet that hauing God before mine eyes, and the businesses of the Christian common weale in recommendation, I woulde haue inuited you, to haue she woe and done me right of your selfe, considering that the lawes as touching themselues do kind Princes, that by this meanes men might auoyde one so cruel warre as I sée, to be prepared, and no lesse than your predecessours had before Troy, the whiche God thorough his grace turne from vs, by the meanes of your iust satisfaction. And in case no, I protest to make you suche warre, that one of vs shall remayne in gage.

                  LOrd Lucidor I maruell me of this proude surname that yée occupy, causing your selfe to be named the Uengeor, knowyng (or else ye should know) that suche a title dothe not pertayne but to God only. And particularly to answere to the articles of your letter, the which yt Crie of Armignac your ambassafor hath presented vnto me, I say, that ye your selfe are bounde to satisfie for the presumptuous woordes ye haue vsed against me and Helen my spouse. And as touchyng that yée say, how that the excuse is not sufficient that loue hath ledde & conducted me to that faulte, inferring that a person of estate, as you and I, shoulde not cōmit so filthy déedes, I say, that the excellent beautie of my Lady Helen, ioyning thereunto the parentage and place whereout shée is issued, haue bound mée to such noble thoughts, dayly drawing me out of my self, continually giuing héede to the honest loue that I bare hir vnder the pure lawe of Mariage, the which ought to discharge me, and to deface the faulte that ye lay vnto me, of the whiche I in no wise féele my selfe reprehensible, if that faulte were not, that I made hir parents, leading hir away without their consent, a thing that greatly displeaseth me, for the loue of them vnto whom in this respect I was bound much. To this, wher ye say that I depriue my selfe of the thing, that good renoun

                  , that the thing whiche I haue done in this case, shall fall and come forth so the augmentation of my great glorie. Also the Princes of Greece are accustomed and wonte to kéepe the poynt of honour, and to reuenge the outrages that men enterprise to doe vnto them. And nowe the Empyre is ruled by those whiche are more stoute of minde and more warlike, than euer it had, it is not ready to fall from the degrée of his auncient reputation. And as touchyng you, if yée will vnderstande reason, ye should departe from this quarell, seyng that Helen is my wife, and that the déede is irreuocable: but for the reparation and satisfaction to you wardes, my Lordes and parents haue

concluded to giue you another lady of great highnesse, beautie and richesse, such a one as by reason ye shoulde content your selfe withall, if not, let it suffise you to remit the déede to the discretion of your parentes and mine, and of my wiues, promising you to condescende to euerie reasonable and hones

               MY Lord, fortune hath willed and fauoured me so well, to ioyne me in mariage with Helen ye Princesse of Apolonia, and although the forme & maner be somewhat light, through the force that I was compelled to vse, and so bring hir to Constantinople, so it is, that to purge ye foreset that men might pretend, I afterwardes made them so many lawfull offers, that the right remaineth on my side, hauing offered the aliance of our house, to Lucidor the Prince of Fraunce, (with whom there was some seeing of hir mariage,) in so muche that the thing done alreadie, cannot be vndone. Yet for all that he hath not ceased too importunately to trouble me, vntill he sent to me, my parents, fautors, and alies, a letter of defiance of fire and bloud, by sea and by lande, pretending (as he doth write) not only to take my wife fro me, but also my head, wherof I was minded to aduertise your imperiall maiestie, trusting that you will not faile me in this matter. My Lorde I beséeche the creator to giue your highnesse a good and a long life.

himself, doing more than the Pelicane for hir little ones: but if this be his affection to measure this cause by your extreme beautie, he hath neuerthelesse restrained it with ye bridle of reason against nature. And it he in so little accesse and conuersation that he hath had with you, did not once twinckle with his eye to the interest and hurt of your highnesse, much lesse he hath hazarde his tong to chaunge the face of his wery heart. What reason can ye pretend thus to banishe him from the fruition of your sight? for léesing that, he séemeth to lyue in darknesse, but that the continual flame of his heart cleareth him, the which had béen, burnt long since, & consumed to ashes if my ordinarie teares had not béen, wherewith I mortifyed it. May it please you then for all satisfaction, that not I, but loue hathe merited for mée, to call me, againe from this exile, or at leastwyse to make me vnderstande euen by your owne hand the conception of your spirite and minde, yt which mine cannot comprehende, if ye desire not the short

In the .10. booke the 18. Chapter.
               RIght mightie Emperours, Kings, Princes, valiant captaines and souldiers, if the time that is past had not lefte vs the memorie of the noble and vertuous actes of our predecessors, and also of many that are yet aliue and present in this battel, I would haue esteemed it reasonable ynough that I (seing it hath pleased you to chose me the head of this armie notwithstanding I am vnworthy in price and comparison of

diuers that are among you) should haue made you an Oration, to excite your hearts to magnanimitie and valiantnesse: but youre vertue knowen already among the Troyans, Romaines, and Carthagiens, the whiche haue oftentimes proued the strength of your armes, doth excuse me of thys payne, & turneth my prayer to God, beséeching him through his grace, to maintaine audacitie and boldnesse in those, from whom as yet it neuer departed. Our victory, if it so plese him, is without doubt, the which comming, I pray you my Lords and friends to stand and persist in your ranges, moderating the heat of your execution, so that ye rape and pray (y• which afterwardes cannot scape vs) set no man out of his aray, whereby we may léese that is certain, and reuolt and turne fortune. Furthermore I aduise you not to disprayse nor to contemne your enimies, but to esteeme them as much as ye thinke your selues to be worth, for of a troth the French mē with whome ye shall haue to doe this daye, are a nation of the best warriers of all the world, the which haue always discomfited those that would assayle and inuade them, praying you furthermore to do better than I can say, & to consider yt this victory vpon those that ouercome al other people, doth prepare you an inestimable triumph of glory, defacing or dusking at once the most noble of our auncetors & elders.

               MY Lords I will not vse great nor many wordes wyth you, to encrease the boldnesse that is naturally in you, and greatly experimented among all your enimies, I wyll only reduce vnto your memorie, that ye must set your assurance in the diuine maiestie, the which doth certenly know to hardē your sinnowes, and to double your breath to execute his iustice by our hands, vpon the vniust vsurpers of other mens. Yet that notwithstanding, good right hath néede of aid, therefore consider all thing to maintain the order of warre, that shall be apointed you by your captaynes and the Sergeants of your

                  ands, being certayne that this one point might depriue and take from vs the victorie whiche we holde as it were euen now betwéene our hands. Consider also besides the common right of this enterprise: the obligation that euery man hath to assist his natural prince, to aid him, to maintaine the honor that they haue of long time obtained, ioyning thereto your owne so greatly celebrated and honored, the which by the losse of this iourney, shoulde be abolished and brought to nothing. Furthermore aduise you, that we hazard our selues much lesse in this battell than our enimies do, for if it were so (that God forbid) that by them we should be broken, the losse could not be so greate of our parte, fighting in this champiō countrey, for why, our wiues, infants, parēts, and friends shall remaine entier and whole without léesing of one foote of land, but if our enimies chance to be ouerthrowen, (as I trust) all we shall be enriched occupying theyr

lands and Lordships, with a glorious satisfaction of oure iniurie.

               MY Lorde, I haue hearde say of wise men, that the Gods haue set in the motions of heauen, and in his lights a certaine force aboue all creatures, and that the things fatall cannot fayle to fall there, where they be destinate, so that it is not in the powre of men to resist it: but yet there be chaunces of great violence, the whiche may be ouercome by magnanimitie, suche as ye haue ended

I say this, to declare vnto you the inconuenience that I am fallen in by the influence of loue, the whiche I thinke is ineuitable, against the effect whereof, I am purposed to resiste, for the conseruation of my honour. For why my Lorde, I pray you beléeue mée, that since the day that I saw your Mai

tormented with an incurable sicknesse, the whiche doth receiue some lightning and rest, discouering my heart to you. This done, I haue purposed to depart from this countrey to returne into my owne realme, considering that from henceforth there is nothing more to be séene worthie of memorie, and that the greatest strokes of the combattes of the valiant men of both parties are fallen and giuen. Thus not béeing able to accomplish my desire as touching you, I pray you not to take it in euill part, but to lay the fault to loue, of whom ye know the power and might, the which is such vpon me, that my will shal neuer be changed nor set vpon any other but by your consent, to the which I wholy submit myselfe, my honour saued.

And be it so, that nowe I sée nothing in you but dolour and displeasure, bicause of those that be deade, yet I shall neuer thinke, such a fault and féeblenesse of heart to bée in you, that any one of you shoulde not desire to reuenge himselfe vpon his enimie, and to sell his skinne dearly. Wel, it is conuenient for vs a little to dissemble our heauinesse, and take pacience perforce, and not to discourage the other. Yée may beléeue mée, that the greatest parte of the annoyance doth rest in my brayne: but I inclose it, to open and manifestly to open it doubled perforce, when tyme and season shall giue me occasion. Therefore I commaunde you all to go and to rest your selues a whyle, that as soone as the fayre Diana or Moone shall arise, setting you in traine and order to go and to inuade our enimies, euerye man taking a white shirt vpon his harnesse, for euery one of vs to knowe eche other: assuring you that the ioy which they had through oure losse may cause them to be negligent, by the meanes whereof, we maye giue them so strayte a hande, that they shall thinke thereof. And this shall be a demonstration that oure little companie hath not a faynte heart agaynst so greate an hoste, séeing that oure execution of vengeance hath no care

for the trauell and payne receyued. As touching me, my friends, although I haue bin hurt like as other, I féele not these woundes so much, as that, the which I haue in my hart of despite and euill will, beléeuing asmuch of other, and that diuers of you which are not deadly wounded, shall not leaue to come to this camisado, the which I woulde should be two houres after midnight, and as secretly as may be, for feare of waking of our enimies, but to rocke them so well, that they shall sléepe for euer. The which thing I estéeme to be easie, considering the great chéere that ye made yester euen, and the small watch that they shall make, trusting in your misfortune.

The which (if ye iudge that I neuer deserued nothing of you, and if ye estéeme not to much vnworthy to haue hir) is the gentle Princesse Alastraxeree, whom I require to my true and loyall spouse: first sūmoning in this case the Prince Florisel, to quite him towardes me for the duetie of mutuall loue, giuing me like comfort and succor, as he hath receiued of me (as he well knoweth) in his affaires.

                  ARlande of Thrace, disherited of hir landes, bicause she made him heritor of hir hearte, that had the propertie of hir libertie so greatly alienated, that she can accept no part in his, to Florisel of Niquea, Prince of Fraunce, Englande, Apolonia, and Rhodes, salutatiō. Fortune hath in such wise conspired against me, that she hath giuen me no other ynke to write withal but bloud, nor no other messenger but a childe, nor hath sent me no succour, but against the sonne of my mortall enemie, for my brothers sake, and yet more than this mortall enimie, bicause I cannot be my owne friende. Loke vpon me ye ladies that doe complaine you of the light turnes of hir customable inconstancie, and take an example to hope in desperation. She hath not left me as much as my surname, the whiche I haue borowed, bicause I would not too much astonishe you in the firste sight of the superscription of my letter missiue, or in the salutation, the whiche shée maie yll sende, that hathe of long time hir heart captiue and afflicted as ye well knowe, and not long since the body in prison. I haue no great leisure with my hande to send my complaintes, when that with my mouth I cannot cause them to be vnderstranded. Praying you for the rest on my part to beleue this Damsell as reason would on your behalfe.

               MY Lorde, the case is this: In the time that my Lady had left you in the Isle of Rhodes, and was at hir returning in my masters the kings Court: she founde there the Duke Madasanill, the tyrant of the next Ilandes, a fierce Giant, great and maruellous mightie, accompanied with foure hundred of his cousins like vnto himselfe, all they being issued of the linage of Furius Cornelius, calling themselues the reuengers of his bloud: This Duke required of the king a wife, vnder the conditions of the vengeance that be vndertooke vpon Prince Amadis of G

                        •
                     e, for whome I was nourished and instructed, if the obligation that came afterwardes had not defaced this cruell enmitie, by the meanes of the succour that the Prince gaue him in his extreme businesse, whom I loued and honoured, and yet knew him not, and was desirous with all my heart to serue him. But the king perceyuing the newe reconciliation of my Ladie with him that had slaine his brother, he deliuered hir quickly into the Dukes handes, commaunding him to marrie hir. He was euen then readie with the Duchesse Arhide, whom he reteyned to come to your marriage. Then hearing she should be sent to such other, she answered the king: beléeue not my Lorde, that the trespasse and fault that I haue done to my highnesse, in that I could not resist the strength of the loue of the sonne, now I make it to the father, assuring you, that I will neuer haue other husbande than the sonne, nor no greater enimie than him, that shall purchase euill to the father, vnto whome I haue sworne and giuen my fayth of peace and concorde. The king was so irrited and chafed with hir answere, that euen vpon the fielde he did disherite hir: and caused an othe to be giuen to Madasanill the Prince of Thrace, setting my Ladie in his power, to

lodge hir incontinently in the fortresse of the lake of foure pauements, the which as men doe estéeme, is one of the strongest places of the worlde. So he gaue him the charge of hir, and of the foure Pauementes, to the Giantes his cousins, commaunding them to keepe hir in prison a whole yeare, if she applyed not hir will vnto him. The which if she did not within the terme appoynted, he woulde that hir head should be smitten off, for the appoyntment that shée had made of his brother. The fierce villaine fayled not to fulfill this ordenance moste diligently, leading my Ladie wéeping and sobbing to the Castell, where he enclosed hir alone with hir cousin Arlinda, deliuering the keyes of the prison to a great and a vile Iayler, reseruing the comming into the selfe same Castell to himselfe, his cousins being established in the foure Pauements, the which cause all those to sweare that come thither, to be at the vengeance of the death of Furio, if not, that he will thrust them into déepe and cruell prisons. At night they shutte in the Gates of their Pauements, and by Caues made vnder the grounde they returne to the Castell, béeing distant from the Laake two shottes of a Crossebowe, of the which the Duke himselfe doth open and sparre the Gates. Well, I followed them
                     •
                   into the Castell, where they suffered me

                  o walke at my case: but I enforced through sorrowe to sée hir in such estate, not knowing howe to remedie it. One day she putting out hir head at a little lattis window, saw me beneath, and sayde vnto me, Florarlan, prepare thy selfe by some meanes that thou mayst speake vnto me: Incontinent I went vp, leauing the Duke beneath with his men, and I prayed Bocarell the Iayler to shewe me so much fauour, as to let me speake a little to my Ladie the Princesse: the whiche answered me, that if I spake any more vnto him, he woulde cast me from the height of the wall. Oribaulde (quoth I to him) if I were weaponed as thou art, I shoulde brydle thy snoute well ynough. Then casting my sight on euery syde, I saw a sworde hanging, the which I tooke sodenly, and the villaine

came to me hauing a Part

                   in two partes, or else he had smitten me through the bodie. Then I gaue him such a garter in the hamme, and so right vpon the ioynt, that by and by he fell downe in the place, and cast out his armes to take me, but I layd the sworde so betwene him and me, that it perste him vnto the hiltes thorow the middle of his bellie. Then through paine he stretched him, and I that they which were beneath shoulde not perceyue it, tooke a hatchet wherwith I cut his gorge, as it had bene a great Oxe. So I tooke the keyes, and went to open the gate of the prison, where I founde my Ladie trembling for the feare that shée had of the strife and debate that she heard betwéene Bocarel & me; the which embraced me, & kist men hundred times, saying: Alas Florarlan, what shall become of thy life, if the Duke vnderstand thy déede? My minion God prserue thée and kepe thée to much more greater things. Madame (quoth I) the thing that is done, cannot be vndone: but I sée the remedie, that is, to go to the Duke, and to tell him that ye haue sent me worde by Bocarell, to pray him to sende me to the king,

Then I sayd vnto hir, that there was no tarying there, & that I, (she beholding the thing) being out of that place, should haue businesse for hir deliuerance. Ye muste (she sayd) goe to Constantinople, and beare me a letter to Prince Florisell of Niquea, but we haue not here wherewithall to make it. It shall not let (sayd I) for that, for I will go and take a Réed in Bocarels chamber, and mingle it with the bloud of this ruffian, with the which ye may write this present letter. Incontinent I kist hir hands, she blessing me, and commending me to God. I shut the doore, & tied the keyes againe to the Iaylers girdle, bycause men should not perceyue that I had spoken with hir.

I went to the Duke, the which did graunt me my demaund verie willingly, and caused the gate to be opened vnto me, & a horse to be deliuered me, vpon whom I haue done my businesse hitherto, kéeping no way vntill I was farre from Thrace. And I haue bestowed one lincke of my chaine for my expences, and this habit, the which I haue taken and made conformable and méete for the estate of my Ladie. This is it my Lorde, that I was charged withall to shewe you.

Therefore I beseeche you my Lorde, to consider my déede with reason, pacifying your courage for my sake, and making agréement with those, whose aliance receyueth no cōparison of that of Furio Cornelio.

So swéete and so faithfull a coniunction cannot be departed without a great and a naturall heart breaking: but after that the first motiō hath giuen his alaruin, the sprite must come to himselfe agayne, and take his breath, considering that teares be but loste vpon a thing irrecuperable, & the torment vaine in a cace that is without remedie.

desire hir yet in this worlde? ye are enuious and doe hate hir wealth, doe ye sorow hir ill? she is in a life immortall, muche more fortunate than is yours: doe ye wishe to folow hir to the place that she is gone vnto? ye shall offende God to labour to departe from hence before ye haue finished all that he hath appointed you to ende in this worlde. Ye haue the renoume of magnanimitie among all knightes, but if ye suffer to be thus ouerthrowne of your selfe, ye shal léese at once al the victories that ye haue wonne vpon other: so if ye shewe your selfe strong and vertuous to resist this gréeuous passion, ye shall ioyne the heigth and fulnesse to the triumph of all your cleare and noble actes. This acte of lamenting is an vnworthy acte for a man, and much more for a Prince, that should be an ensample of light.

                  AGesilan, ye shoulde content you with the name of Daraide, and with the amitie that one Damsell doth beare to another, without the increasing thus of my amorous passions, by the chaunging of your name, that I in your absence shoulde suffer the feare of a hundred daungers, in the whiche peraduenture ye are not. But what say I? For if ye loued me with the like loue that I loue you, ye shoulde endure and suffer for mée the selfe same trauell, that I nowe suffer for you. Alas my deare friende, I thinke that loue woulde that I shoulde pay by the anoyance that I receyue by your absence, the dolour that yée shoulde nowe suffer for béeing so farre from mée. O that it pleased GOD, I mighte holde my heart in my hande, to the entente I might as well contemplate with the eyes of my heart my Agesilan, the whiche is there so liuely printed, as I haue him both nighte and day represented before the eyes of my thought. Alas loue, wherefore is it thy will, that my sufferance farre passeth his that

For why, giuing me a lyke aduauntage, I am sure that the publication of my dolours, might prepare me some quietnesse in steade of hyding them, I féele that dayly theyr fiercenesse dothe growe within my courage, after the fashion and maner of fire straytely kept within the fornace continually doubling his force & strength. O fountaynes of my teares, succour and helpe my lyfe in this daunger of the burning flames, in the which ye sée that my heart doth consume and burne: and ye heauie sighes, faythfull witnesses of my heauinesses, giue mée a little ayre to my embrused breast, that I die not, and that dying I cause not him to dye likewyse, for whome onely I enforce me to liue. Alas Daraide, yée haue brought mée out of this trumperie, by the whiche yée shoulde haue enioyed my loue, without opening of your thoughtes to mée, to torment mine the more with this cruell flame, the whiche béeing discouered, coulde gyue you no lesse alleageaunce, than it giueth mee nowe discomfort, assaying mée to holde and to keepe my wyll and mynde couert. Alas Agesilan, howe shoulde you holde and thinke your paynes well recompensed, if I were suffered or euer I die, to cause you to knowe, that the feare of léesing my lyfe coulde not wynne so muche vpon mée, that I woulde wryte vnto you the extréeme passion that I suffer for your loue.

               ALas, I sée nowe, that my death onely shall cause my Ladie to knowe me, séeing that I dare not discouer and open who I am, fearing to léese vtterly the fauours that I haue receyued of hir. Alas my Ladie Lardenia, if ye cannot succour me by some remedie, at leastwise ye shall succour me by the pitie that I pray you to take of my misfortune. If ye can giue me no hope, giue me some consolation, that I in this trauell in the which ye sée me, do not vtterly dispayre. O that my destinies are miserable, for why the thing that I séeke for my comfort, that is the sight of my Ladie, whiche doth encrease my martyrdome more and more. Alas my deare Lardenia, what good counsell can ye giue me, séeing that my dolor doth not suffer it? What consolation, séeing that the meane from whence I shoulde receyue it (that is the presence of my Ladie) causeth me to double my anoyance and trouble? What remedie, séeing there is no hope? what life, séeing that I am in a continuall death? Alas my Ladie Duchesse, I know that ye cannot giue me the thing that I demaunde of you, nor I aske it not of you for any other intention, but to take the pitie on me, that doth wholly lacke in my Ladie. O howe often doe I

desire death, & how often in the selfe same houre doe I feare it, to the ende that I lese not the occasion euermore of continue in my mortal anguishes and paines. O how much more fortunate should I be, if I wholy had lost my vnderstandinge and yet I wil not léese it, fearing to lese with it, the remembrance of the reason whiche proceedeth from my sense and perseuerāce, for the great pride of my thoughts. Alas, it shal be best to holde my peace, that I doe my selfe no wrong, seing that I knowe not, and knowing that I may not speake through the straunge dolours, for the which the desyre to die, and the will to liue, doe torment me.

the ioy of the goodnesse and pleasure, whereof through your good grace I haue tasted and sauored the tranquilitie and gracious swéetenesse. If before this I haue had any desyre. I haue desired it after such a fashion, that I knew not the thing that I desired. But now being learned by experience, I know that I desire the most pleasure and goodnesse that is possible to desire, sauing one other that I knowe, but ye maye not know it, although the pleasure that I desire be extréeme. Hitherto Madame, I haue tormented my selfe to sée and to beholde the apparant graces of your beautie, by the whiche yé

Alas Madame, cause I beséech you, that so great goodnesse as ye haue shewed me, turne me not to greater euill, and denie me not the remedie, which kissing your fayre and white handes, I pray you to graunt me as soone as the dolorous passion in the whiche I am, doth requyre it.

O I, the most happiest of all knightes of the worlde, séeing it hath pleased you Madame, to make me worthie through your fauours of the thing that I by my selfe could in no wise decerne. This letter is onely to cause you to vnderstand my great ioy by the which ye are now indetted to me for the thing that hath caused me to

merit it, that is, that I returne very shortly vnto you, to take and to haue the selfe same pleasure of your beautie, that it pleased you the last night to graunt me, so that by this newe ioy, I may rewarde the anoyance that I endure in the time that I cannot finde the oportunitie of so great a pleasure. Wherefore Madame, I pray you continually to intertaine me in such a good houre, that if ye haue béene the cause that I am nowe exalted to so high a degrée, that hereafter ye be not the cause of my miserable fall and ruine. But to the entent ye shall not reprehend me of too great importunitie, I will make an ende of my letter, kissing a thousande tymes your white and delicate hands, in remembrance of the peace that folowed the warre that is past. I recommend me to my deare Caria, praying hir shortly to purchase me the tyme so greatly desyred, in the whiche I maye renue the fortunate occasion of my glorie.
            
            
               The complaint of Queene Sidonis. In the .12. booke. the .21. Chapter.
               O Graue honour of my high and royall lynage, howe hast thou conducted me to an euill fortune, whereof I may receyne a iust rewarde of my folly? O loue, howe doest thou cause to appeare in me thy deceytfull force and strength, causing mée to vse hatred and crueltie vnto him that I loued much more than my selfe? O Fortune with what inconstancie and lightnesse art thou chaunged, putting me then in such desperation when I beganne to haue hope, shortly to accomplish the thing that I desired most in this worlde? O Gods immortall, with howe much rigour haue ye willed to recompence the flerce pride, and the prowde presumption of the Quéene Sidonia? O my deare daughter, and yet the daughter of him that robbed the holy rites of my chastitie. Alas, howe woulde ye haue payed me for the thing that ye denyed an
                     •
                   for the loue that ye bare continually to your father, in recompence

of the outrages and iniuries that I dayly sought for him. O my daughter the first of the worlde, and none like in beautie, to the ende to make and to render like vnlike the delour that I endure nowe for thy death? O cruell death, howe doest thou leaue me in so miserable a life? O cruell life, howe doest thou leaue me in so miserable a death? O Gods immortall, wherefore doe ye suffer so great an iniurie as is that, which I receyue by my life, séeing my daughter Diana is dead? But what do I say? It is iust, that ye as ye are iust, doe shewe me to rigorous iustice, to cause me to take vengeance vpon my selfe, confounding me in a certaine dolour and heauinesse, the which I haue procured to my selfe. Alas Daraide, howe doest thou giue to me and my daughter the dutie whereof thou wast indetted vnto vs: to me, giuing me with thy ende, the ende of the folly of my vengeance, & in killing againe by thy death, the hope and confidence that I had in thy life: to my daughter, recompencing hir death by thine, the which is the last payment, whereof thou wast bounde to the loue that thou didst beare hir, and to that, that she did beare thée. O fortunate Damsell, that by thy death hadst might to pay the thing thou diddest owe to my Diana for thy loue, althoughe that hir mother coulde not doe so muche for hir owne. O faint Moraisell, howe arte then nowe well reuenged of mée, and well satisfyed of the vengeance that I of so long time haue sought for? O Gods immortall, séeing that ye denie me iustice, leauing me in this miserable life, I will not refuse it, nor denie it to my owne handes, and I will kepe the priuiledge of my franke and frée will, the which I haue receyued of you from the time that I was borne. Well then, and killing my selfe with my owne handes, I giue my selfe life, the which ye haue denyed me, bicause ye promptly and readily ynough gaue me not to death.

               IF the great enterprises were not accompanyed with daunger, beléeue this Madame, that the prayse of those that shoulde chaunce to haue the victorie, shoulde be verie little: and for this reason and cause, the greater that the perill is, so much the more is the honour, the glorie, and the mortall renowne. Thinke not the great thinges can be ended by small things, nor with little trauayle men can not wynne muche prayse. Thus Madame, ye may knowe this, that to conquere and get you, must be put in aduenture, séeing that I assaying nowe to winne you, put my selfe in hazarde to léese you. Alas, sée this is the occasion that so greatly giueth feare vnto my wordes, bycause that willing to haue and get a great gaine, I am in daunger of a great losse, and fearing that séeking you too muche, that I léese you not the more: for why, to aduenture my selfe to léese my selfe in this praye, I aduenture but little, seeyng that it is nowe so long ago, that I am left in youre loue, althoughe yet that in parte of the worlde, I haue not had so great gayne, as in one fortunable losse. The cause of my amorous passions is manyfest by the excellencye of your beautie. The dolours past, the which I haue suffered in your seruice, doe giue you a sure testimonie of the regarde and reuerence that I haue had alwayes to youre highnesse. The boldenesse that I nowe doe take, doth sufficiently excuse it selfe by my payne, and the prowdnesse of my thoughtes, throughe my royall and noble lynage, accompanyed wyth chaste and lawfull desyre, wherewyth I haue alwayes kepte the reuerence due to youre honour, and shall kéepe it all my lyfe, wythoute desyring or praying you to gyue mee anye remedye for my anguyshes and paynes, if it bée not vnder the tytle of faythfull maryage, and kéeping

in you youre chastitie, euen suche, as ye nowe maye haue it. Or else Madame, with these conditions it may please you to knowe, that vnder the name, and vnder the habite of Dariade, ye haue in your presence Agesilan, the sonne of the great Prince the prudent Phalanges of Astre, and of the strong Princesse Alastraxeree. Maruell not that I haue thus disguised me, and couered my self with such armes to winne your good grace: for in any other habite, but in one like vnto yours, I could not haue hazarded my selfe in an enterprise, at least way so perilous, with any hope of victory. Ye know now Madame, the thing that hitherto I haue continually kepte secrete from you, ye sée the dolorous woundes wherewith in this cruell warre of loue, your excellent beautie hath cruelly wounded me, I haue nowe defended my selfe long inough, couering me vnder the shielde of on

But if by the rigour of your answere, ye wil refuse and denie me the pitie that I require, beleue Madame, that very long ye cannot be rigorous vnto me, and that shortly my pitifull death shall cause you sorow it, to whome as long as he liued, ye were so cruell. So my vnfortunate soule shall hitherto comfort hir selfe, after that the body be buried, by your lamentations: O I most fortunate, that hath set my heart in so noble a place, that the ioyfulnesse of my desires, doe make me the most fortunatest of al the earth, and the last of my misfortunes doe promise me yet a certaine consolation. Nowe Madame ye haue hearde the litle that I can say of the great dolour that I suffer, and the lest of the trauell, whereof I féele that I haue trauelled. But if I cannot sufficiently inough expresse vnto you the euill that I indure, ye may easily comprehende

it, if yée estéeme it so great in me, as your beauties, and your excellencies he great in you: seyng then that by this meane ye may know by your selfe the immortall anguishes that torment me, and if yée cannot perceyue it by your selfe, I beseeche you againe by the iuste pitie that the victor shoulde haue vnto him that is ouercome, to receyue me to mercie, seing that I

But to leaue no occasion to any man, nor not to thinke that your proudenesse hath founde any fragilitie in me, I will not vse vnto my honour the pitie that I owe vnto it, to defende it by your death from the offence that yée haue committed: for I will not

               O Swéete death, why doest thou suffer me yet to returne to lyfe agayne? O miserable lyfe, why doest thou denie me death? O loue how muche hatred haue I proued in thée? O cruell hatred, wherefore doest thou take the name of loue? Ah, ah I vnfortunate, in searching of loue, I haue founde his contrarie, and thinking to finde a necessary remedie for my disease, I haue encreased it without any comparison. O my Lady Diana, how oft haue I feared the crueltie, that I proue now in you? Seyng then that your will is suche, I would it should not please God to sende one thing, that is so impossible to me, as to liue any longer with the disgrace and disfauour of my Lady. O euill houre to much miserable, for I requyre nothing, but it is denied me by the thing that I require it, nor I flie nothing but it is graunted me by the thing that I flie. Alas madame Lardenia, I beséeche you to take no pitie vpon mée, seyng I pitie not my selfe, and that to conforme my will to my Ladies will, for I cannot will, but that shée willeth, and I hate my selfe more than shée hateth me: but if ye loue me, it shalbe reason that ye will that I will, that is onely to goe to accomplish the promisse that I haue made to my Lady the Quéene, so that all that I shall doe from henceforth, shalbe done agaynst my will: for I kn
                     •
                  we that in fulfilling that I haue promised hir, I shall yet accomplish the wil of my Lady Diana. Well, now I percei
                     ••
                   well inough, that the Quéene made me not without occasion such a strange request as she made me: for that was, bicause that by the death which I shall receyue, she may vse the pitie towards me, that my Lady Diana denied me, cruelly to sley me. Certainely I can hope no lesse of the valiantnesse and highe Chiualrie of the Prince of Greece in this combat that I haue enterprised against him, but that by the death of so féeble and so disfauored a creature as I am, he shall satisfie his glorious renoume,

and that, vnto the whiche he as a noble knight, was bound to doe, repairing the wrong that I receyued to liue the longer. O fortunate Prince, seyng that all things prepare themselues to his good houre, and I likewise vnhappie, seing that fortune, and the Quéene, and the will of my Lady Diana, haue prepared by the handes of so great a Lorde, the death, whiche after my law I could not purchase with my owne hands. O mightie God, how thou euerywhere doest shewe thy sage prouidence? for in this iudgement of my death pronounced by the mouth of so noble and so excellent a iudge, as my Lady is, it was very reasonable that ye should helpe hir with so excellent a minister to execute hir soueraine iustice, with the lamentable sentence of my cruell destinies.

Therefore Quéene of Guinday, ye shall vnderstand and know, that nother the iniurie receyued for your loue, nor your beautie, nor for that of your daughter Diana, are not yet out of the remembrance of Balthasar, and of Bruzerbe kynges of Russia and of Gasa.

Gods iudges of the losses and calamities that shall chaunce through your occasion, calling fortune to our ayde, the whiche seyng our wonderfull armie, hath already giuen vs the assurance, the whiche your subiectes if ye defende them not shall wante, assuring vs of the amendment and healyng of our woundes, whereof the paine, loue, and the iniuries heretofore suffered, haue wounded our courages vntill death: you & your daughter through your beauties holding vs in a more cruell warre than that, the which is most cruelly prepared for you, if your gratiousnesse giue you not peace, the whiche wè are minded to conquere by force of armes.

                  SIdonia Quéene of Guinday to Balthasar kyng of Russia, and to all other kinges of his linage the whiche are come vniustly with him to inuade hir Ile, dothe sende salute and health, the whiche the Gods should not saue very long, in so vnreasonable a quarell. I woulde not be so afrayde king Balthasar, if it were conuenient for me in time to come to proue agaynst my breast the sworde of Lucrece, as chastitie doth binde me nowe to defende me against thine. But if neither the loue that I beare to the Prince of Greece, nor the feare of his highnesse, coulde neither set nor make peace, nor truces to the stronge warre that I haue prepared against him: scarcely the leaste warre wherewith the king of Russia dothe threaten me, can cause me in anywise to feare, and yet it is lesse possible, that the hatred I beare him may through his proudnesse be couerted into loue: nor estéeme not at all that my minde and will is so fliyng and inconstant, that hatred shall cause me to séeke

peace with thée to my dishonour, seyng that loue for my honour constrayneth me to make warre against the Prince of Greece. God forbidde that Sidonia shoulde lesse estéeme the nobilitie of hir courage, than the greate force of armes wherewith thou threatenest mée with fire and bloude: for with fier and bloud I will defende my chaste will, and I will assay to kéepe it with the selfe force, that the Gods haue sometimes suffered that it was kepte agaynst themselues. And know, that making warre agaynst me, thou doest make it yet more rigorous agaynst thy honour, and willing to consume my Countrie with thy fiers, thou canst not consume the fire, wherewith the Prince of Greece hath enflamed me. It may be that thou shedde the bloud of my subiectes, setting them vpon the edge of thy swoorde: but when thou shalte haue done it, swoordes to shedde our bloude shall neither fayle my daughter nor me: for we had much rather to die in our chaste libertie, thā to liue in a vile seruitude. The hatred that caused the Quéene of Carthago to die for AEneas, shal not cause Sidonia to die for Dom Florisel, but she shall wel defende hir self frō the feare of death, for to defend hir faithfulnes that she ought him, for the stable and burning loue, that she hath cōtinually borne hym, & at this present dothe beare him. Consider then king Balthasar that thinking to winne me, thou doest léese mée, and thinking to offende me, thou shalte offende in nothing, for a sworde shall not fayle me at all, to resiste thy offence: but thou mayste well offende me with thy armes: the lawes of the Gods immortall whiche gouerne the sworde of iustice, haue muche more force than thine, thou shalte likewise offende the Prince of Greece, whose righte of mariage thou wouldest violate, for although he hath playde by trumperie and deceyte, yet it is so that for his honour he will not let passe the iniuries without reuengyng of them that thou shalt doe me. And seyng that for the reuerence that he beareth me, he in my fauour hath saued their liues that sought to haue his heade, as the kings of Gaza, and of the Massagenes,
                  
& other of thy cōpanie, giuing sure witnesse, thou mayst well thinke, that nowe he shalbe as readie to cause them to léese theyr heades to please me withall, as he hath at other times bene prest and readie for my loue to saue them. Wherefore kyng Balthasar, enterpryse not a warre whereby, through hatred thou doest hope to winne hir, that hateth and maketh warre agaynst hir selfe, the greate loue that enflameth hir, cōstrayning nor suffering hir honour to be destroyde, nor shal féele hir selfe. Demaund neyther loue nor peace of hir, that hath neyther loue nor peace with hir selfe, and with thée. So then I am minded to defende my will, and to resist thine, and continually (sauing my accustomed chastitie,) I will sustayne my déere countrey and realme, calling the Gods to my iustice, and men to my defense. And purchasing this peace of me, I am ready to sustayne suche warre as thou haste denounced vnto me.

               IF the duetie whereof we are indetted to vertue (my déere fréendes and faythfull Citizens) commaunded vs not rather to sacrifice our liues for the conseruation of oure honour, than to suffer it in any thing to bée corrupted, in asmuche as honour beyng loste, we during this mortall life, can haue nothing that is good, they may complayne them of the vncertaine issue of thinges, & that with good right, and to sustayne their auncient renoume, doe giue themselues with a franke courage to the inconstancie of fortune. But séeyng that wée be bounde to defende our honour euen to deathe, the multitude of enimies, nor the doubtfull chaunce

of one battell, shoulde not put vs in feare for nothing. We should onely feare least that the faulte and fayntnesse of heart cause vs to incurre any infamie, and that the vniustnesse of our enimie make vs not more afearde, than our good right dothe make vs constant: for by such slouthfulnesse men might doubte of the experience of fortune, the whiche gaue long since to sixe thousande souldiars of Greece, the victorie of one million of Perses, of the whiche there were slayne two hundred thousande in the playne fielde. The selfe fortune graunted to Lucul the Romane, hauing but tenne thousande souldiars in his tentes, to ouercome by his vertue and good righte, the kyng Tygrane, and his infinite thousandes of fighting menne, among the whiche were fiftie thousande horse menne. This greate armie was ouerthrowen and broken in battell araye, and the ensigne displayde, and in open fielde, by those whiche were very fewe in number, but many in magnanimitie of courage: for by the reason of theyr good righte, they supplied the defaulte of theyr number and by the strength of their armes, they resisted the feare of fortune, as knowyng that the multitude of armed menne, maketh the victorie neuer the surer, and beyng fewer in number than the enimies, menne shoulde not léese the assurance, and lesse, the hope to winne the glory of the combatte and fielde. There is not he that may flée deathe, when shée is appoynted him by the destinie of the highe Gods: nor also there is not hée, the whiche dying, is not bounde to saue his good renoume, that the shame and infamie of his deathe doe not desile the auncient honour of his lyfe. Yée doe knowe the good right that I haue in this warre, ye may remember the obedience that hitherto yée haue shewed me, as to your Quéene: And if I be not disceyued, yée do yet remember the rewarde that ye haue receyued for your faithfulnesse. I thinke that yée abhorre all tyrannie, and I thinke that eche of you is readie to chase it from him, as prepared and bounde to receyue deathe for the entertaynement of libertie,

in the which I haue alwayes enterteyned you, and haue hither to defended you. We shall haue to our ayde the Gods immortall, as those which are the certaine reuengers of outragiousnesse, and the sure defenders of innocencie. If then reason, good right, and the ayde of Gods fayle vs not at all in this quarell, let vs so doe that good courage fayle vs not, and when fortune would enuie our good houre, let vs rather choose an honourable death, than a shamefull lyfe with a miserable seruitude and bondage. Consider also of your part, that I refusing the alliances of these barbarous kings, that ye shall not onely defende my priuate quarell, but also your publike, with your goodes, your libertie, your wiues, your children, marking the calamities that in time to come, ye (if ye haue suche tyrants to your Lordes) shall indure and suffer. Therefore my friendes take a good heart vnto you, and nowe shewe the valiantnesse and vertue that ye haue, the which is néedfull that ye nowe shewe, to defende your selues from those, that haue enterprysed your ruine and destruction. Do so then that men may sée their spoyles hanging within our Temples, for an immortall tryumph of your victorie, and ye shall beléeue that the king of Russia shall neuer triumph of the faythfulnesse that Sidonia doth owe vnto him, that she first hath receyued for hir husbande: but contrariwise, for the Barbarian sworde shall not so soone appeare within our walles, but that mine shall incontinent appeare within the breast of my daughter and me, that by this franke death, I shall deliuer my life from subiection, leauing my dead bodie vpon the colde earth without spot, and satisfying him by the immortalitie of this sacrifice, the which (as I trust in your vertue and fortitude) ye would haue made of your selues, before I should sée my self in such extremitie. But I am so assured of ye iustice of the Gods, and of the force and strength of your right handes, that I doe yet assure my selfe to be excused of this sacrifice that I speake of, and that ye shall cause it to fall vpon our enimies, to their great confusion, and to your perpetuall glorie. Nowe in this

confidence I will make an ende of my wordes to beginne the effect, and I will call to the defence of our libertie, the fauour of the Gods, and the succour of the straunge knightes the whiche are nowe in my Court: and bycause my treasures as great as they bée, shall not bée sufficient to recompence theyr vertue, I will praye them to haue a respect to the honour and to the immortall renowme that is prepared for them, for the true and better recompence of the trauayle that they shall obteyne, dayly wandering thorowe the worlde, to employe the force of theyr highe chiuarlie: for nowe they haue founde in thys warre a verye iust occasion.

esteéemed certaine, but further, they brake them, and sette them and theyr confederates in suche a rowte, that they sette vs agayne in our fyrst libertie, and in oure auncient herytage. By the meanes whereof, after the Prophecies of my fayre Diana, Daraida béeyng past, Phoebus came, did beheade in my presence within the Towre of Diana the Image of Dom Florisell, whose heade did depriue mée of all sentimentes, and enforced Dom Rogel of Grece, to auenge the death of hys father, for the trespasse of Daraide. And afterwardes the combate was so greate betwéene them two, and with suche sheadding of bloude, the whiche they loste the same day, that euen both of them fell downe vppon the grounde as deade, vntill that the braue Serpent and the victorious Quéene, knowing againe after the Prophecyes hir deare sonne vnder the habite of Daraide, reuealed vnto hir by hir dolorous cryes, and mortall mourning the thing whiche was the occasion to léese the name of Daraide, and to recouer that of Agesilan, with my daughter Diana for hys spouse, whome hée had woonne alreadie by the faythfulnesse and constancie of his loue, in the vertue whereof, they set at libertie, and out of prison the infant Dom Rosaran, and the duchesse of Bauire, in the inchaunted Towre, whose prisoners they shoulde haue remayned without comming forth, vntill they two the most accomplished and perfit in faythfulnesse of loue, may giue them the wayes and meane, and to vs the consolation of the heauinesse that we suffer by their absence, the which shall endure vntill the excellent King and Quéene of Englande, be entered into the inchaunted Castell, deliuering them out of prison, to the great glorie of their faythfull loues, and to the consolation of vs all. Therefore to find some maner of peace in this warre, we pray you and beséech you by your comming, ye will finde the meanes we may haue it: the whiche thing shall returne to your greate lawde, and to oure rest, wythoute the whiche wée shall remayne and bée, vntyll by youre comming yée make an ende

This is it my Lords, that causeth me to wish and desire to haue you as many as yée be in my hands, as I thinke it shall happen, if the prophecies of my Gods deceyue me not: for I finde by them, and ye, if ye thinke it good, do remember, that shortly the forces of the fronters and borders shall through a certayne ambushmente destroy the house of Grece, and that the braue Lyons of the king Licbrastron shall be brought vnder, and the strength of their clawes effeblished, vntill the Lord of Russia set them agayne at libertie, by the obscure and dark cloudes of his knowledge, to his great glory, and to the lande of him that shall cause them to enioy that clemencie, for the rewarde of the rigour that is past: and considering this warre, I wyll sende you peace, without the which it is impossible to prepare the thing that is necessarie for an armie.

                  DOn Bruzarte king of Russia, confederate with a hundred and thréescore kings of the Orient, by the counsell and diuine sufferance of our soueraigne Gods disdayning at and for so many offences that haue béen done vnto them by the house of Grece, hauing so often times moysted the fieldes with the bloud of their seruaunts, and set fire in their tents, they haue nowe gathered their armie togither: bicause that the smoke of the burned temples, as it were out of a censer, is ascended before their diuine Maiesties, to require vengeance: and it is paste and gone into their most soueraigne and heauenly Empire. Therefore we haue ordeyned after the power graunted vnto vs by the Gods, that all the house of Grece shall passe by the edge of the sworde, and all their Cities shall be burnte

with our flames, that within a while after the Russians may cause them to be edified and buylded agayne to the great glorie of their vertue, and to the immortall glory of our Gods: and calling vpon their name, we sende you this arest signed, not aduertising you otherwise of the day, nor of the hour

And hitherto we pray our Gods to kéepe you in health, for your greater sicknesse, assuring you that for a short peace ye shall haue a long warre, in the whiche wée promise to couer the great seas, and the large champion fields with our armies, and to make them red with your bloud.
