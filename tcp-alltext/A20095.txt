               YOu shall behold drawne (on this paper) certaine Plat-formes of ground, vppon which two mightie, and (almost) inuincible Armies are this present Summer to ioyne Battaile: Here you may knowe what Trenches they cast vp, what fortifications they raise, what Rampires, what Parapets, what Counterscapes, &c. Let it not appeare strange, that from the Regiment of knights Military, I

Before the Allarum be strucke vp, behold I offer my selfe (and all the forces which I leade) into your hands. With the Pen, (a most daungerous peece of Artillery) doe I vse to come into the field: That shall be discharged to do you all the Honour it may, and I be ready, in any seruice fitting such a souldier, to Fight.
            
            
               Yours vnder the Cullors of your Loue,

The Hollander and the Spaniard haue bene (and I thinke still are) your best Lords and Maisters: If euer Captaines did pray, they haue prayed for them onely. Cutlers and Armorers, haue got more by them within these few yeares, then by any fowre Nation (besides them) in Christendome all their whole liues. But for this Beyond-sea quarell, the people of this vtmost end of the world (if all the Fence Schooles had bene put downe too) had (I thinke) forgotten how to handle their weapons. The Low-Countries therefore haue (in Renowne) gone beyond

kingdomes of higher Fame, onely for thus repairing and keeping open those old and Ruinated Temples of Bellona, which had beene shut vp in these latter Ages, and stood despised because defaced. Yet euen those Dutch warres, haue bene vnto you that seru'd in them, but as wares in these dead times are to Merchants and Tradsemen: you were the richer for hauing them in your hands, but you had not such hot doings, as you desired. You came often to the cracking of crownes, but neuer to the true cutting of throats: your Commanders had too much of the Martiall Theoricke, your souldiers too little of the Practicke. But be of good courage, the wind shifts his point, better dayes are comming vp, the sicke world lies on the Mending hand: For in this present yeare of 1609 drummes will be strucke vp, and cullors spread, vnder which you may all fight, and all haue good pay: Forsake therefore the townes where you lye ingarison'd (during this Abstinence from warre) leaue your drinking there, sithence here you may be in action, and drinke healths in bloud; The battaile is expected, the place appointed, the General's well knowne, the Armie's leauying, their munition preparing: If you desire either to be Voluntaries, or to be Prest, giue your names presently: for this is the Muster-booke, Farewell.

Hereupon pouerty summoned her councel for war, together they came, and being set, shée at large laide open what wrongs and dishonors her enemy had done to her & her subiects, withal declaring how willing her poore people Pouerties speech to her councell. were to venture their liues in her quarrell, and that their very fingers itched to be doing with the rich chuffes, and Usurers, and others that were seruants, or rather slaues to Money, adding moreouer, that a number of her enemies subiects too welknown by the name of Banck-rupts (being a great and auncient family in her greatest City) haue of late The villany of Bank-routes. gotten other mens goods into their hands, spending them basely and villanously in prisons, colouring this their politicke theft, by giuing out, that they are subiects to Pouerty, albeit they were neuer suffered to harbour in her dominions. To cleare herselfe of these, and such like imputations and dishonorable scandals, as also to let Money know, that she hath more right to those townes & Cities to which she pretendeth sole claime then Money hath herselfe, and Dum ciuitas erit, pauperes erunt. that like a Prince, though her coffers be not so full, nor her forces so able, she purposeth to defend her owne title, & not to loose one foote of that which was left to her by her Ancestors, all of them comming out of old & ancient houses it is therefore her resolution, to send defiance to her insolent enemy, Pouertie brings any man on his knees. and to that end (for their aide and Aduice, hath she thus called them before her.
            Her councellors applauded ye courage of their Princesse, and (being first brought on their knées) gaue her reasons to goe forward in so iust a warre. All of them for the most part

being glad, that the Golden age should now come amongst them, and proudly reioycing that they should bid battaile to so rich an enemy as Money and her subiects, to haue about with whom, they haue for a long time had both a desire, and waited for aduantage to picke a quarrell.
            Those that were at this time of Pouerties councel, were men well beaten to the world, all of them great trauellers, such as had séene many countries: As hardy as they were wise, it shall not be amisse in this place, to draw the liuelie pictures of them, because if any of their owne countrimen happen to behold them, their report may cōfirme the trueth of all that is here related. Their names are these:

               Despaire and Carelesnesse were brothers, & in great fauour Despaire. with Pouety (their Princesse) she neuer was well but when one of them was in her company, yet the wiser sort

thought that they did much mischéefe to the State. Despaire was not beloued by reason of his crueltie: for if hee got any man into his hands, hee hung him vp presentlie.
            
               Hunger was one of the best commanders for warre, that Hunger. was in all the Land: a man of almost an inuincible stomack, hée had ouerthrowne many armies, & sped most fortunately at the besieging of a Towne or Cittie, where continually he vseth to behaue himselfe so valiantly that no stone wall (of what height or strength whatsoeuer) is able to hold him out: yet is hee: not accounted so sound a common wealths man as some of the rest, for that it is imagined, hee loues the enemy better then his owne country, & if occasion were offered, would rather fly to Money then serue Pouerty (his Soueraigne.) A great transporter of corne he hath béene from time to time: for which cause the people hate him in their hearts, and doe now and then openly cry out against him with such clamors, that he hath béene glad to stop their mouthes. The onely good that he doth, and indéede the only cause for which the kingdome loues him, is that when hee leads men on in any hot péece of seruice, they get such stomacks by séeing how brauely he laies about him, that they neuer come off till they be satisfied, victory béeing as good to them as meate and drinke.
            
               Sloth, by reason that he is troubled with the gout, busies Sloth. himselfe little with State matters, he hath lyen bed-rid for many yéeres, and gréeues that any stir should be made in the common wealth he was neuer either tilter or trauellor, his body being weake and subiect to diseases, which made him vnapt for both.
            
               Repining was the onely man, that whetted on both his Repining. Prince and her subiects to go forward in these warres: for he could by no means abide either Money or her followers, it fretted him more to sée any of them prosper, then if himselfe had fallen into the lowest misfortune. He dealt altogether in Monopolies: for which the people gaue him many

bitter curses, and those (I thinke) kéepe his body so leane.
            
               Industry, was a goodly personage, a faithfull friend to Industry. his Prince, and a father to his country, a great Lawyer, & a déepe scholler, stout in warre, and prouident in peace. Pouerty (whom he serued) did often say, that two such councellors (as Industry) were able vpon their shoulders onely to support any State in the world. In deare yeeres, when the Land had béene ready to sterue, hath he reléeued it, and turned dearth into plenty: his head is euer full of cares, not for himselfe so much as for the people, whom hee loues and tenders as déerely as if they were his kindred: yet stand they not so well affected to him, because he compelles them to take paines, when tis their naturall inclination (like Drones) to liue basely, and to féede vpon the bread that the sweat of other mens browes doe earne. A good States man he is, and a louer of peace, séeking rather to draw Money to be stil in league with Pouerty, then to haue them thus at defiance one against another.

            These councellors, after many arguments, weighed out to prooue the necessity either of warre or peace, at the last concluded vpon the former. The drumme was therefore struck vp, to try what voluntaries would offer themselues: but few voluntaries (or none at all) came in.

            The businesse thus successefully thriuing at the first, gaue encouragement to all to haue it set forward, so that precepts were forthwith directed to the Hals of euery Company, Hals of euery company furnish men on both sides. who albeit they had furnished the Queene of siluer and gold (Mony) with certaine voluntary bands of sound approued souldiers: Yet (because they themselues, that were old growne okes, cared not how many paltry low bushes that nestled vnder their shadowes were cut downe) they prest ten times more of euery trade, to fight vnder the banner of Pouerty, than those were that went to serue her enemy.

But proclamation being made, That vpon paine of death they should all (by such an howre) be ready to come into the field, and fight for Pouerty (their soueraigne Lady and mistres.) It is incredible to be spoken, what infinite multitudes of all occupations, (some yong, some old) were in a short time assembled together.

               Schollers hearing of this, fled from the Uniuersities, and made such hast to be in pay with Pouerty (whom they had Learning held in contempt. knowne a long time) that some of them had scarce put shoes to their seete: The Queene bestowed very good words vppon them, because Schollers had alwayes béene fauored by her progenitors, and (vpon her bare command) they tooke such place vnder her in the Army, as was sutable to their professions.

            These yonger Brothers were appointed to stand Infans perdus (or the Forlorne hope) because though they had little

And for that purpose did a goodly troupe of knights put themselues (as knights errant) into

Armes, in defence of ye innocent wronged Lady, (Pouerty) which Cheualiers, though they durst not (as some ill-tongd people gaue out) shew their heads in the Cittie: yet were they appointed Masters of the field, and had the charge of the most resolute troopes that were to scale the Cittie (If the enemie should cowardly happen to fly thether) and to ransacke all the Mercers and Gold-smiths shops, not so much to set frée the silkes, veluets, plate and iewels imprisond most cruelly in them, as to vndoe the old Cittizens, & then to marry their yong wiues, and so to raise them vp to honour in their most knightly posteritie.
            A regiment of old seruingmen were sworne the guard to Pouerties person, of whom there was great hope, that they Old Seruingmen the gaurd to Pouerty. would both stand stifly to her in any danger, and if ye maine battailes did euer ioyne, would be the onely Canonéeres to breake their ranckes, because they had such excellent skill in charging and discharging of the great Bombard.
            There came in some seuen thousand Banckrouts, offering Banckrowtes come to Pourt but as spies. their seruice to the distressed and wronged Princesse, who gaue them thankes for their loue: yet was she fearefull to trust them, because a number in her owne army exclaimed vpon them, as the ranckest villaines in a common wealth, and that they had vndone them, their wiues and children: But the dangers wherein they now all stoode, requiring rather hands to punish the wrongs done by an enemie, then to rip vp old wounds of their owne. Those seuen thousand had the ordering of all fire-workes, Mines, and countermines, as béeing the onely rare fellowes for damnable and spéedy blowing vp of men in any assault.

The workes of Princes are great, and require many hands to finish them, and a number of engines cannot be set, going so closely, that no eare shall heare them: Ioue may talke in his big voice of thunder as soone and not be vnderstoode, as a kingdome may call vp her owne subiects with the yron tongue of warre, and not awaken those people that are her neighbours. The eies of a true State do neuer sléepe, Princes are quickest of hearing, the blowes that forraine enemies giue, are broken for the most part: because the weapon is alwaies séene and put by, otherwise they would cut déepe, and draw blood, where (by such preuention) they scarce giue bruises.
            This mercilesse tyrant therefore (Pouerty) could not kindle such fires of vprores, and ciuill mischiefes, but that the flames (like burning beacons) armed her enemies with safetie, euen as they put them into feare. Her ragged troopes were more apt to betray themselues and their procéedings, then polliticke to betray the foe into any danger. With swift wings therefore did the newes of this inuasion fly abroad into all countries, and at last alighted before that glorious and most adored Empresse (Money) whom néerest it concerned, because all the arrowes of their enuie and intended malice were shot at her bosome.
            The drom of warre beate in her eare, not in the dead of night, when her glories and beauties were darkened and

eclipsed, but when she was seated in the throne of all her pleasures (which a whole world was rifled and trauailed ouer to maintaine in height and fulnesse) when her pallate The life of a sensuall man. surfeited on the variety of dishes and delicacy of féeding, when her body shone brighter then the sunne it selfe, who (in his lusty heate begot her) strucke an amazement into those that beheld her, by the splendor of those maiesticall roabes which she wore: when musicke went into her eare in ten thousand seuerall shapes, when her walkes were perfumed, her sports varied euery hower, when her chéekes were dimpled with laughters at her iesters, her Parasites, her Pandors, and all the rest of those seruile soothing Apes, that in pide colours waite vpon and shew trickes to fate the appetite of that Lord of flesh and bloud, the blacke Prince of the world, her husband. Then, euen then, in the full sea of all these iollities, pompes, and whorish ceremonies, the onely bewitchers of mankinde, came sayling in, the newes of a suddaine insurrection, and an vnexpected inuasion, by that common, fatall, and barbarous spoiler of so many kingdoms, infamous amongst al nations by that beggerly name of Pouerty.
            
            These newes (vpon the first arriuall) did no more moue the great Indian Empresse (Money) then the bleating of a shéepe terrifies the king of forrests (the Lyon.) Money was rich, strong in friends, held league with Princes, had whole countries at her becke, nations were her slaues, no people but did loue her. On the contrary side, Pouerty (her enemy) had sinall reuenues, fewer friends, a world of followers, but none of any reckoning, except a few Philosophers, Alchemists, &c. She held many townes, and was obeyed in most kingdomes but how? as théeues are obeyed by true men, for feare, and because they cannot otherwise choose, her owne strength therefore being so good, and her enemies fuller of spite then of power, she onely laughed at the thunder of her threates, and resolued that her pleasure should spread larger sailes.
            
               
But her councell being prouident, carefull, and iealous of their owne estates, wisely considering the dangers that a weake enemy (being desperate, and hauing little to loose) Riches make men cowards, may put the best fortefied kingdome to, & the most valiant nation did in the end, with one consent fall on their knées, most humbly intreating thier Soueraigne Mistresse to giue ouer her reuellings, maskes, and other Court-pleasures for a time, and that aswell for the safety of her owne royall person (to take héede of them: for many plots were now, and had oftentimes bin laid) as also for themselues, whose liues and liberties wholly depended on her, either to leuy present forces, which should méete this beggerly Monarch in the field, and so vtterly to driue her out of the kingdome, or else to giue the rich men of her Empire leaue to make strict and seuere lawes to take away the liues of that wretched & scattered people that follow Pouerty in these commotions, wheresoeuer or whensoeuer they take them medling in any of her wealthy dominions.
            These words brake forth with such lighning, that Money stampd for very anger, that so base an enemy should put her subiects into feare. Their vigilance awaked her, and like a good Prince that would loose her life rather then her subiects should perish, she began (with the Eagle) to shake her royall wings, and to be rouz'd out of her late golden slumbers, & securities, that

            To their requests she yéelded, and thereupon to fortifie her kingdome against all the shot of Villany & Vengeance, shee summoned those of her councell together, whom shee Councellors to Money. know to be most faithfull and most seruiceable in a busines of this nature, state & importance. Her councellors names were these.

               Couetousnesse was an old wretched leane fac'd fellow, Couetousnesse that seldome sléep'd: for his eyes (though they were great, and suncke at least two inches into his head) neuer stood still, but rolled vp and downe, expressing a very enuious longing gréedinesse to enioy euery thing that they looked vpon. He neuer pared his nailes, and being often asked the reason why, he alwaies answered, that he saued them for his heire, for béeing cut off, after hée himselfe was dead, they might be put to sundry good thrifty purposes, as to make hornes (being thinly scraped) for a Scriueners lanthorne to write by a nights, or to nocke arrowes, &c. Hée kept not so much as a Barber, but shaued his owne head and beard himselfe, and when it came to wey a pound, hée sold it to a Frenchman to stuffe tennis balles. Money (his Soueraigne) cared not so much for him, as he did for her, she could make him do any vile office how base soeuer; but because he was Couetous men are slaues to that which is a slaue to them. saucy, and would often checke her for taking her pleasures, séeking to restraine her of her liberties, she hated him, and was neuer more merry then when one brought her newes once that Couetousnesse lay a dying. Yet was he well beloued af the best Citizens, and neuer rode through the city but he was staid, and feasted by many Aldermen, and wealthy Commoners, few Courtiers loued him heartily, but onely made vse of him, because he was great, and could do much with Money (their empresse.)
            
               Prouidence was but of meane birth, the ladder by which Prouidence. he climbd to such high fortunes, as to be a councellor to Money, being made by himselfe, much giuen to study, yet no great scholler, as desiring rather to be frée of the City, then to serue a long thréed-bare Prentiship in the Universities. He is rarely séene in Minerals, and distillations, and will draw Aurum potabile, or fetch quick-siluer out of horsedung, he will grow rich, and be in time the head warden of a company, though he were left by his friends but thrée shillings thrée pence stocke to set vp, such another he was as Whittington, a very cat shall raise him if he be set vpont,

He is the best that writes Almanackes in these times, and where the rest write whole Calenders of lies for bare forty shillings a yéere, (seruingmens wages) he foreséeing what will happen, buies vp all the commodities of one or two Countries at one bargaine, when he knowes they will bee déere, and so makes vp his owne mouth, and for it, gets much fauour at the hands of Couetousnesse his elder brother.

There is no more conscience in him then in Tauerne faggots, yet yong gentlemen pray for him daily that he may be fetched quick to hell. He is an insatiable féeder: for a Scriuener and he will eate vp foure men at a breakefast, and picke them to the bare bones. He loues not a Preacher, because hee frights him out of his wits: for he neuer heares any of them talke to him but he thinkes himselfe damned. He hath no skill in Arithmeticke, but onely in the rule of Interest. He is the Diuels Tole-taker, and when he dies, lies buried with his ancestors in the widest vault of hell.
            These were the councellors whom Money assembled together, to consult vpon hers and their owne safeties, from the base assaults of their wild and desperate enemy: who being solemnely set in their due places and the Quéene of Riches her selfe beeing aduanced vp into her imperial chaire, Parsimonie (who by this time was gotten vp and ready) tooke vpon him to be speaker for all the rest.

               The Oration which Parsimonie made before his Empresse.

Goddesse of Courtiers, Patronesse of Schollers, Protectresse of Souldiers, Fortresse of Cittizens, & the onely comfort to Saylors.

               No sooner was Dixi sounded, but the maine points of this Parsimonions oration, came backe againe like an eccho from all the rest of the voices there present. All their breath blew one way, all their councels were directed and went only by this compasse. Money weighing (in the vpright scales of her iudgement) their wise and thirsty opinions, found them not halfe a graine too light, and therefore very royally yéelded to whatsoeuer they consulted vpon, whereupon sodaine order was giuen, and all speedy preparation made for the entertainment and receiuing of Money into the Citie, whose presence all the Cittizens day and night thirsted to behold.

Scatter-good (because he was knowne to be an Herald) was admitted to haue a sight of Money, and vpon first presenting himselfe, very stoutly deliuered his Ladies defiance.
               
                  Money was noted to change colour, and to looke excéeding pale, all the while the challenge was breathing forth, either for very anger, or extreame feare, but those that knew her qualities swore it was with anger, and the conclusion iustified their oath, for on a soddaine shaking her golden tresses Money giues men courage. with a maiesticall brauery, she defied that base defiance in regard the sender was of slauish and beggerly condition.

These words she vttred with indignation, and high colour in her cheekes, and hauing eased the greatnesse of her wrath, commanded the messenger away: yet ere he went (to shew that a true Prince when he wrastleth hardest with his owne passions, should be carefull still of his renowne, fame and honours, she bestowed a golden chaine on Scatter-good, which Pouerty tooke from him, as scorning to sée any fauours (giuen by her enemy) worne by any of her subiects, especially her housholde seruants.

The tenor of which precepts followeth.

I charge you all vpon your allegiance, to hoord vp your corne till it be musty, and then bring it forth to infect these needy Barbarians, that the rot, scuruy, or some other infectious pestilent disease, may run through the most part of their enfeebled army: Or if I, who may command, may perswade you, let mice and rats rather bee feasted by you, and fare well in your garners, then the least and weakest amongst Pouerties starued infantery, should get but one mouthfull, let them leape at crusts, it shall be sport enough for vs and our wealthy subiects about vs, to laugh at them whilest they nibble at the baite, and yet be choaked with the hooke.

Hire ware-houses, Vaults vnder ground, and cellers in the City, and in them imprison all necessary prouision for the belly, till the long nailes of famine breake open the dores, but suffer not you those treasured victuals, to haue their free liberties till you may make what prey you please of the buyers and cheapners. At which time I will prepare a certaine people that shall giue you your owne asking, and buy vp all you bring by the great, who shall afterwards sell it deerer then it was bought, by three parts, of purpose to choake this starueling scallion-eaters, whose breath is stinking in my nosthrils, and able to infect a quarter of the world.

               Thus she spake, and her spéeches kindled such fires of resolution in the hearts of her soldiers, that the Allarum was strucke vp, Ordnance planted for Batterie, scaling Ladders made ready, and all the instruments of terrour and death put in tune, which were set to be played vpon at the

This assault (which was the first) gaue ouer, euery Captaine retyring to his place, the Desperueines (of Prodigall heirs meete soonest with Pouerty. 
                  Pouerties side) comming off at this time with the most losse.
               Few attempts were after made to any purpose: onely certain yong prodigall Heires, who (as voluntaries) maintained themselues in seruice vnder Money, were appointed to be light-horsemen for discouery of the enemies forces (as she lay incamped) who now and then in a few light skirmishes had the honour to issue forth, and to set vpon the Assailants that beleagured the Cittie: but Pouertie still draue them either in to their owne shame, or else had them in execution (euen in despight of the Cittie forces) and put them euer to the worst.
               The Gold-beaters (who knew themselues on a sure ground within the walles) lingred of purpose, and would neuer bring it to a battaile, onely to wearie the aduersarie, whom they meant to vndoe by delay, because she could not hold out long for want of victuals. They within cared not though ten thousand diuels amongst them, so Money (their mistresse) whom they worshipped as a God, would not

leaue their company, and the rascoll Déere that (without the walles) were euery howre hunted out of breath, vowed to eate vp one another, before they would raise ye Seige, and be hanged vp like Dogs (at the Cittie gates) for they were now accounted no better then dogs, but they would haue their peniworths out of Money for a number of wrōgs which by her meanes they had endured, when she hath seene them and their children ready to starue, yet scornd to reléeue their necessities. Thus both their stomacks beeing great, and aswell the defendants as the assailents resolutely confirmed to stand vpon their guard, and to stay the vtmost of any miserie that could waite vppon a lingring warre: behold the rich-plumde estridges, who had most fethers on their backes, and least cause to murmure, began Dead termes & times that are cold in doings, pinch the rich as well as the poore. to mutinie amongst themselues, the imprisoning of Money (their sole soueraigne) so close within stony battlements, did not shew well: they were loyall subiects to her, & would frée both her & themselues, vnlesse she might vse her sports and princely pleasures, as she had wont, Mercers had their shops musty, and their silkes moldie for want of customers, Goldsmiths had their plate hid in cellors, where it lay most richly, but looked more pittifully and with worse cullour, then prisoners lying in the hole. Haberdashers had more hats then they could finde heads to weare them, if they had béene such arrant blockes them selues to haue giuen their wares away, trades had no doings, all the men were out of heart by beeing kept in, and all the women ready to be spoyled for want of walking to their Gardens: Euerie one spent & spent, but who tasted the sweetenes? In stead of selling their wares, they plyed nothing now but getting of children, and scowring of péeces. In stead of what doe you lacke? was heard Arme, Arme, Arme. This géere was to be looked into, and therefore they desired their gratious Empresse (Money) not to lye lasing thus in a chamber, but either that she would be more stirring, that they (her Subiects might haue better stirrings too, and (opening the Cittie

gates) to fight it out brauely, or else they vowed there were at least ten thousand) whose names stood now in her Muster booke) that shortly if this world lasted, would shut vp their dores, shew her a faire paire of héeles, and from her fly into the hands of Pouertie their enemie.
               Upon the necke of this, came likewise a supplication from certaine troopes of Uintners without the Barres, Inkéepers, common Uictuallers and such like, who plaid ye iackes on both sides, and were indéede Neuters, a linsey-wolsey people, that tooke no part, but stood indifferent betwéene Money, and Pouerty, the tenor of which petition presents it selfe thus to the world.

               The Inuader vnderstanding that the quarrell would be decided in a pitcht field, and that crackt crownes would be both giuen and taken on either side, grew exceeding ioyfull: and therefore calling for Sharker (one of her boldest & wittiest Heralds) him she sent to Money, to know where the Rendeuous should be made for both armies to meete in, and what péece of ground should be best famous to posterities by their battaile. Money tooke aduice vpon this, most of her old beaten Captaines, laboured earnestly to haue it at Bagshot, but all the gallants cryed baw waw at him that named Bagshot, so that for a quarter of an hower, none could be heard to speake, there was such a Baw wawing. The Herald Sharker, in name of his Mistresse, who sent him, requested it might be at beggers bush. But euery soldier swore that was a lowzy place, and so for a day or two, it rested vncertaine and vndetermined.
               In which Interim, a murmuring went vp and downe that not onely Pouorty had maintained this terrible Siege Famine and the plague come along with Pouerty to besiege the City. against the City, but that Dearth also, Famine and the Plague, were lately ioyned with the same Army, besides many strange and incurable diseases were crept into the camp, that followed Money: for Ryot her minion, was almost spent, and lay in a consumption. A hundred in a company were drowned in one night in French bowles: fiue tunes as many more were tormented with a terrible gnawing about their consciences. All the Usurers in the Army had hung themselues in chaines, within lesse then three howers, and all the Brokers, being their Bastards, went crying vp and downe, The Diuell, the Diuell, and thereupon because they should not disquiet the rest of the Soldiers, they were fetched away. These and such other vnexpected

mischifes, put Money into many feares, doubts and Nulla saius bello pacem te poscimus omnes. distractions, so that she inwardly wished that these vnlucky warres had either nener béene begun, or else that they were well ended, by the conclusion, if it might be, of some honourable peace.
               And as these stormes of misery fell vpon Money and her troopes, so was the army of Pouerty plagued as much, or more on the other side: nothing could be heard amongst the Souldiers but cries, complaints, cursings, blasphemies, Oathes, and ten thousand other blacke and damned spirits, which euer hawnted them and their Generall herselfe. Want pinched them in the day, and wildnesse and rage kept them waking and raueing all the night. Their soules were desperate, their bodies consumed, they were weary of their liues, yet compelled to liue for furder miseries, and nothing did comfort them but a foolish hope they had to be reuenged vpon Money. So that so many plagues, so many diseases, so many troubles and inconueniencies following both the armies (by meanes of the tedious Siege) a perpetuall truce, league and confederacy was A Truee. confirmed by Money and Pouerty, and the councellors on either part: that in euery Kingdome, euery Shire, and euery City, the one should haue as much to doe as the other: that Pouerties subiects should be euer in a redinesse (as the Switzers are for pay) to fight for Money, if she craued their aid, & that Money againe should help them whensoeuer they did néede: and that sithence they were two Nations so mighty and so mingled together, and so dispersed into all parts of the world, that it was impossible to seuer them.
