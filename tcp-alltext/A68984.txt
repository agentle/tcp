            TO THE RIGHT HOnorable,
the Lords of his
Maiesties moſt Honorable
priuie Counſell.
            
               RIght Honorable,
It cannot
bee vnknowne
to
your wiſedomes, how perilous
a thing, both to the
Crowne, the Peeres, and
the Nobles; yea and to all
the parts of the commonwea
                  •
               th,
is the vngratious,
vngodly, yea, prophane,
& helliſh humor of murmuring:
eſpecially againſt
God, the king, or any their

ordeyned magiſtrates, in a
Kingdome: for the cure
wherof, what care is to be
taken, your diſcreet conſiderations
can determine:
and knowing in your honorable
diſpoſitions, an aſſured
hate vnto all ſuch
vnpleaſing and vnprofitable
ſpirits, as no doubt, but
you wil weed, out frō the
good hearbs in the groūd
of your charge; and again,
how bleſſed a thing, the vniō
of harts wil be to your
honorable Spirits, whoſe
continual care of the preſeruatiō,

both of our king,
and his vvhole kingdom,
deſerueth no little honor:
I haue preſumed rather
vpō your honorable pardons,
of what may offend
your patience, then your
fauorable acceptāce of my
vnvvorthy ſeruice, to preſent
your Honors vvith a
little tract againſt Murmurers
& murmuring, in
vvhich if I haue paſſed anie
thing diſpleaſing to
your good patience, hūblie
crauing pardon, I attēd
the ſorrovv of my Imperfection,

but if I haue in
any thing contented the
leaſt of your good likings,
I will leaue murmurers to
the fruite of their malice,
and pray to God, ſo to
bleſſe your good minds,
that you may find out
ſuch offendors, and giue
them the due of their deſert;
and in your ſelues, among
your ſelues, may be
ſo lincked in your loues,
that to God and his Maieſtie,
you may euer liue
togither in your ſeruice,

that when wickednes is
weeded out, and Grace is
planted in the place, God
may be pleaſed, the King
beſt preſerued, and the
Common wealth beſt gouerned:
So fearing with
tediouſnes, to be a trouble
to your good patience,
beſeeching God to bleſſe
you al, with as much happines,
as murmurers are
worthy to want, I humbly
reſt.
            
               Your Honors in all Humblenes,
            
         
         
            
            To the Reader.
            
               LET me intreat you (by
the kindnes I hope in you)
to bee perſwaded that
what I haue written in this little
Tract, is rather done to reueale the
follie of a malitious humor, then to
taxe any perſon with the infection:
The labour is not long, nor the ſence
obſcure; the ſubſtance whereof, leauing
to the cenſure of your diſcretion,
or correction of your good patience,
with my loue to your kind deſert,
I reſt as I find cauſe.
         
      
      
         
            
            Againſt Murmurers,
and Murmuring.
            
               OH Murmurer, what
wouldeſt thou haue?
was there euer any
Kingdome ſo many
years, and ſo many waies bleſſed?
and thou in it, ſo little worthy
of thy comforts, and ſo worthy
of the contrarie: is not thy
Earth fertill? are not thy Riuers
ſweet? is not thy Aire temperate?
are not thy Citties faire, thy people
rich, thy men ſtrong, thy
women fruitfull, thy Magiſtrates
wiſe, and thy King gratious? are
not thy Seas as a wall to defend
thee from the aſſaults of

thine enemies? and hath not thy
peace bred ſuch a plentie, as
maks thee admired in the whole
vvorld? haſt thou not vvith all
this, the richeſt iewel in the world?
yea, and more vvorthy then the
vvhole vvorld? vvhich is the heauenly
vvord of God, to direct
thee in his holy vvill? and vvil not
al this ſuffice thee, to bring thee
to the ſeruice of thy God? to acknovvledge
his goodnes, to admire
his greatnes, & to giue glory
to his Maieſtie? vvhat ſhall I
then ſay vnto thee? but as I ſaid in
the beginning: oh vvhat vvouldſt
thou haue? In the time of blindnes,
vvhen the booke of life vvas
ſhut from thy reading, vvhen thy
learned preachers, and zealous
people vvere put vnto the fire,

vvhen ciuil vvarres did breed thy
penury, and thy forraine enimies
vvere readie to inuade thee, vvhē
thy Gouernour vvas a Tyrant,
thy life a bondage, & thy eſtate
a miſerie, then hovv glad vvouldeſt
thou haue bin, to haue taſted
the leaſt of the bleſſings? that
novv thou art full of; and then
vvouldeſt thou haue prayed for
deliuerance from thy ſorrovves,
and ioyed in the leaſt hope, that
might haue cleered thy heauy
heart: and art thou novv ſo hard
harted? ſo ill natured, ſo void of
ſēce, or ſo full of ingratitude? that
thou canſt not conceiue, thou
vvilt not acknovvledge, thou
doſt not vnderſtand, or vvilt not
bee thankfull, for this great meaſure
of grace that God hath beſtovved
vpon thee? vvhat then

wil becōe of thee? but let me aske
thee, what doth aile thee? is eaſe a
griefe? pleaſure a paine? peace a
Trifle? plentie a Toy? a good
King, a ſmall bleſſing? a graue
Counſaile, a meane comfort, and
the vvord of God, a ſlight Ievvell?
learned Preachers, and profoūd
Lawiers little bleſſing; what
ſhall I then ſay vnto thee? but
that they are ill beſtovved on
thee; doeſt thou murmure at Religion?
is it not better to ſerue
God, then Man? and to beleeue
the Truth, then follovv Error? to
vvorſhip God in the Heauens,
then make a kind of God on the
Earth, and to begge pardon of
thy God at home; then to buy it
of a man abroad: doſt thou murmure
that the Saints are not worſhiped?
and wilt thou forget to
vvorſhip God aboue? wilt thou

murmur at thy Loyalty? & learne
the witch-craft of Rebellion? wilt
thou forget thy vocation, and fal
into the ſin of preſumption? are
theſe the fruites of thy deuotion?
fie vpon thy follie, that haſt no
more taſt of diſcretiō: wouldeſt
thou rather hear the vvord? & vnderſtand
it not, then vnderſtand
it, and beleeue it? or truſt rather
to the vvord of a Prieſt for thy
cōfort, then to thine ovvne faith
for thy Saluation: oh pittiful imperfection!
vvhat ſhall I ſay vnto
thee? but onely pray for thee; that
God vvil forgiue thee, & opē the
eyes of thy vnderſtanding, that
by the light of his grace, thou
maiſt get out of thy darknes, and
beholding the greatneſſe of his
mercy, giue glorie to his holy
Maieſtie. Leaue therfore thy murmuring,
and turne it to thankſgiuing,

that ſo great a part of the
vvorld, being ſhut vp in the caue
of Error, thou vvalkeſt in the vnderſtanding
path, of the perfection
of all truth: leaſt if thou continue
in thy accurſed nature, thy
gratious God, ſeeing thy vngratfulnes;
either depriue thee of thy
comfort, or caſt thee into vtter
darknes; vvhile the Buls of Rome
ſhal breed too many calues in Britanie:
Again, doſt thou murmur
at peace? haſt thou a ſpirit of diſcord?
doſt thou delight in blood?
oh brood of Caine, looke on thy
brother Abell, & heare the curſe
on thy condition: doeſt thou
vvalke in quiet? vvorke in quiet?
eat in quiet? ſleep in quiet is thy
vvife in thy boſome? thy Children
at thy Table? thy ſeruāts in
thy buſines? do thy friends come

to ſee thee? thy neighbours ſalute
thee? & thine enemies liue from
thee? doth Muſicke fill thine
Eares? Beautie thine Eyes? Wiſdome
thy Heart? and Treaſure
thy mind? and are all theſe benefits
to be deſpiſed, and this peace
not to bee applauded? God forbid:
when children with Drums
ſtrike marches of mirth, and
Trumpets ſound dances in ſtead
of deadly marches; when men
may ſing, women dance, and children
play; & altogether reioyce▪
and giue praiſes vnto God; is this
peace to be murmured at? fie vppon
ſuch wicked ſpirits, that can
bee poſſeſt with ſuch helliſh humors:
leaue therefore thy murmuring
at this great bleſſing of
peace, and giue glory vnto God

for the comfort of ſo great a grace;
for by it thou poſſeſſeſt more thē
all the world without it: for
though by labour may wealth be
gotten, and by wiſedome honor,
yet without that bleſſing of peace
through the malice of Ambitiō,
thou maiſt ſoone looſe all that
thou enioyeſt: pray then for the
cōtinuance of ſo great a comfort,
and murmure not at the ordināce
of God, in ſo gracious a ſhewing
of ſo glorious a mercy: ſhew not
the dogged nature, of ſuch a deuiliſh
ſpirit, to drowne thy ſoule
in the delight of bloud: Thinke
on the miſerie of ciuill warres, or
what warres ſoeuer; ſubuerſion
of States, death of Princes, maſſacres
of People, teares of Widdowes,
cries of Children, Citties

burning, Tyrants killing, Terror
ſpoiling, and hearts diſpairing;
when thou ſhalt ſee before thy
face, thy wife diſhonoured, thy
daughter deflowred, thine infant
ſlaine, and thy ſelfe made a ſlaue
to villanie▪ and if it poſſible might
be, a hell vpon earth, where deuils
like men, or men like deuils, ſeeke
the deſtruction of the whole
world. Murmure not then at the
ioyfull bleſſing of peace, but imbrace
it with ſuch thankfulnes, as
may continue thy happines, leaſt
vvhen thou vvouldeſt haue peace
thou canſt not, becauſe vvhen
thou haddeſt it, thou regardeſt
it not: Againe, doſt thou murmure
at plentie? pittie but thou
ſhouldeſt want that is neceſſarie,
vvho hadſt rather ſee thy brother

ſtarue then to releeue him out of
thy aboundance: Oh vngratious
wretch, ſo far from the feeling of
Gods grace, that for a priuat gain
wouldſt wiſh a general griefe, like
a miſer that pinching his belly to
ſpare his purſe, wold ſee the death
of a vvhole Kingdome, to fill vp
one corner of his cofers: or doeſt
thou murmure at the plentie of another,
beholding thine own penury?
Why, remēber thou broghteſt
nothing into the vvorld, nor
ſhalt carry any thing with thee out
of it, and what thou haſt, is but
lent thee, & ſhalbe taken frō thee,
or thou frō it: cāſt thou not then
content thy ſelfe vvith thy portion?
and rather labour for thine
own good, then enuy at the welth
of another? or doſt thou murmur

at the vvealth of many, and thine
own pouerty? looke into thy ſelf,
and ſee if there be not more poorer,
then richer then thy ſelfe; and
if not, yet, that thou art not alone
to beare the burthen of thy croſſe.
But hadſt thou rather ſee a bare
harueſt, a naked tree, a thin Meadow,
and a blaſted vineyard? then
thy barnes full of corn, thy ſtacks
full of hay, thy trees full of fruite,
and thy veſſels full of vvine? canſt
thou ſo much forget God, to bee
vnthankfull for his bleſsings, and
bee ſo vnnaturall to thine owne
heart, as to ſeeke the miſerie of
thine owne Soule? What dogge
would ſhew ſo diuelliſh a nature?
Haddeſt thou rather gnaw vpō a
cruſt, then haue a whole loafe?
ſippe of a little cruſe, then drinke

of a full cup? vveare a peece of a
ragge, then a vvhole ſuite of apparrell?
and a penny in thy purſe,
rather then thy cheſt full of gold?
then art thou either a foole, that
vnderſtandeſt not vvhat is good
for thee; or a dogge, that diſpiſeſt
that is giuen thee; or a deuill, in
not acknovvledgeing the goodnes
of thy God tovvards thee:
hadſt thou rather ſee a table without
meat, a ſtable vvithout horſes,
a paſture vvithout Cattell, &
a purſe vvithout a pennie; then
good meate, faire horſes, fat cattle,
and a full purſe? oh monſter
of nature, vvhat doſt thou then among
men? leaue therefore thy
murmuring, and let me thus farre
aduiſe thee: what thou haſt, ſpend
not vainly; what thou gaineſt, get

not vilely; vvhat thou vvanteſt,
beare patiently; and vvhat thou
giueſt, giue frankely, & murmure
not to part vvith thy plēty, nor at
the plentie of another, for plentie
is a bleſſing of God, vvhich taken
thankfully, breeds many comforts,
while penury is a plague, either
inflicted vpon ſinne, or ſent
for a triall of vertue, vvhere patience
poſſeſſing the ſoule, the bodie
may bee the better ſeruant.
Murmur not therfore at the bleſſing
of plentie, either vpon thy
ſelfe, or others. Againe, doſt thou
murmure at eaſe? oh vvhat madnes
doth poſſeſſe thee? hadſt thou
rather tire out thy body, thē giue
reſt to thy mind? and labor out thy
heart, thē giue cōfort to thy ſpirit?
hadſt thou rather mourn thē ſing?

cry then laugh? run thē vvalke? &
be beaten of thine enemie, thē be
kiſſed of thy friend? hadſt thou
rather watch two nights, thē ſleep
one? vvorke ten dayes, then play
one? and faſt ten vveekes thē fare
vvel one? I do not beleeue thee, or
els beleeue thee to be mad. Hadſt
thou rather ride a hard trotter, thē
an ambler? ſit on a Pitchforke thē
a pillovv? lie on a board thē a bed?
if thy vvil ſo much exceed thy vvit,
I ſhall neuer take thee for a reaſonable
Creature; & therfore murmure
not at eaſe, vvhich to nature
is ſo cōfortable, & to reaſon ſo acceptable:
but doeſt thou murmur
at eaſe in others, & pain in thy ſelf?
others may haue the eaſe thou wā
               teſt,
& thou the eaſe they cannot
haue: they may ſit while thou walkeſt,

but perhaps walke whē thou
ſleepeſt: they may haue health, &
thou ſickneſſe, yet thy conſcience
may be at better quiet: they may
fare delicately, & thou hardly, yet
thy ſtomacke may diſgeſt better:
they may poſſeſſe more, yet thou
be better contented. Murmure
not therefore at eaſe, either in thy
ſelfe, or other, for it is a bleſsing
ſooner loſt then gottē; & murmuring
is the worke of malice, which
once ſetled in the minde, ouerthrowes
more then bodie, when
many kinds of diſeaſes robbe the
heart of all eaſe. Again, dar'ſt thou
murmure at thy King, that hee is
not in all thinges to thy minde:
Traitor vnto God and man, hovv
canſt thou excuſe thy villany? whē
if thou canſt cōſider his worth, &

confeſſe his worthyneſſe, thou
wilt hate thine ovvne ſoule, to cō
               ceiue
one diſcontentiue thought
of his Maieſtie, or the leaſt
thought of hurt to his ſacred perſon:
but, baſe wretch that thou
art, to grudge at that vvhich thou
canſt not iudge off, or to inioy
that thou art not vvorthy off: for,
if thy King vvere vnlearned, it
might be a ſorrovve to thy heart;
if irreligious, a torment to thy
ſoule; if of baſe linage, it might
haue bin a vvound to thyne Honor;
if Tiranouſly minded, a vvoe
to thy comfort▪ if vvickedly inclined,
a plague to thy patience:
but of a Royall Lyne, from the
Loynes of many Kinges, and frō
one Kingdome to an other, or rather
by vniting of Kingdomes to

make a Monarchie of peace, to
the admiration of the vvorld, ſo
profoundly read in the rules of
beſt learning, and ſo vvell Linguiſt
in the moſt neceſſary Languages,
as are gratious in his
perſon, and Maieſticall in his
place; in Religion, ſo zelous; in
diſpoſition, ſo vertuous; in mercie,
ſo gracious; as both for his
preſence and his ſpirit, is vvorthy
to be honored, honorably loued,
and louingly ſerued. Hovv canſt
thou be ſo vile of diſpoſition, or
ſenceles of good, as to murmure
at ſo great a bleſsing, as God
hath giuē thee in his gouernmēt?
Doeſt thou murmure at his pleaſures,
and loue the ſame thy ſelfe?
Doeth he hunt and delight in
Dogges? better to nouriſh dogs,

vvho ſhevv but their natures, and
vvill bee at their Maſters Seruice,
then to maintain thoſe monſters
of men, that cōtrary to the nature
of men, vvill murmure at the welfare
of their Maſter. Again, hadſt
thou a King vvithout a Queene,
thou mightſt fear trouble through
vvant of Iſſue, but ſo gracious a
Queene, and the mother of ſo
bleſſed Children, ſo Princely a
Progenie, as may glad the hearts
of the vvhole Kingdome; Villain
to thine owne Soule, that vvilt
murmure at theſe Comforts, and
not be thankefull for theſe bleſſings?
Did he hunt thine heires
from their poſſeſsiōs? their heads
from their ſhoulders? thy Preachers
from their Churches? or
thy Cities from their Liberties?

then hadſt thou cauſe to grieue,
but haſt no vvarrant to murmure:
but hee that ſeeketh thy ſafetie,
continueth thy peace, encreaſeth
thy plentie, and maintayneth thy
pleaſure, is louing to thee, reioyceth
in thy loue, and deſerues to
be loued of thee, What deuill can
poſſeſſe thee, that ſuch a King cā
               not
pleaſe thee? wouldſt thou haue
him gouerned by thee, vvho gouernes
the vvhole Kingdome beſides
thee? thou art fooliſh, vvho
being a Subiect, vvouldeſt bee a
King; and how canſt thou thinke
to gouerne, vvhen thou haſt not
learned to be gouerned? Againe,
canſt thou by thy policie vnite
kingdōs, as he hath don by his perſon?
art thou ſo wel allied as to link
ſuch loue in royall lines? No, thou

art not; and if thou vvert▪ yet God
hath made thee a Subiect, and
therefore make not thy ſelfe a rebell,
but rather learne hovv to obey
his vvill, then to murmure at
his gouernment: be thankefull to
God for the much good in him,
and murmure not at the euill that
thou miſconceiueſt in him; leaſt
God ſeeing thy vileneſſe, bring
thy villany to light, and vvith a
ſhamefull death giue thee the due
of thy deſert: leaue then to murmure
at him, and be thankfull for
him, murmure not at his greatneſſe,
conſidering his goodneſſe;
nor at his caſe, for thou knovveſt
not his care; nor at his vvealth, cō
               ſidering
his vvorthineſſe; nor at his
povver, conſidering his vviſdom:
but loue him, ſerue him, honour

him, and obey him, and be thankfull
to the Maieſty of the heauens,
that thou mayeſt behold ſuch a
Maieſty on Earth: Murmure not
at the tribute thou payeſt him, for
all thou haſt is too little for his ſeruice:
Murmure not at the Seruice
thou doſt him, for thou canſt neuer
doe him ynough for his vvorthines:
Murmure not at thy vvant
of his bountie, leaſt he ſee more
thy greedineſſe then good vvil. In
ſumme, murmure not at him, not
any thing that may diſlike thee in
him, leaſt God making him ſee
thy vvickednes, thy life make anſvver
for thy folly, vvhile continuing
in thy murmuring till thy
death, it carry thee headlong to
the deuill. Againe, doſt thou murmure
at the Counſel, either for the

povver of their authoritie, the honour
of their place, or the State of
their poſſeſsions? Looke backe
into thy ſelfe, and bee aſhamed of
thy ſinne: Is not the care of the
Commonwealth the courſe of Iuſtice,
the quiet of the ſtate, and the
preſeruation of the vvhole Kingdome
vnder God and his Maieſtie,
in the hands of thoſe Magiſtrats,
vvhoſe vviſdome deſerueth
honour, vvhoſe care deſerueth
praiſe, vvhoſe labour deferueth
vvealth, and vvhoſe vvil deſerueth
obedience; and canſt thou (ſenceleſſe
wretch) fretting in melancholy,
not able to diſcerne the leaſt
part of their perfectiōs, offend thy
God, thy King, thy State, yea, thy
ſelfe, and thine owne Soule, vvith
the wicked humor of Ingratitude?

vvhich growne out of Ignorance,
bred in Enuie, growes vp in Ambition,
& ſhall die in Ignominie:
Fie vpon thy inhumane Nature;
that, abiding nothing that is
good, doeſt onely ſeede vpon
Euill: vvho being careleſſe of order,
vvouldeſt haue no Law; diſſolute
in thy vvill, vvilt endure no
Counſaile; fond in thy vvit, makeſt
no reckoning of Wiſedome:
and not knowing the labour of
Studie, vvouldeſt allow nothing
for the Studient. Oh vvhat a cō
               mon
vvoe would be in that commonvvealth,
vvhere thou ſhouldeſt
haue power to appoint Gouernours?
but leaue thy murmuring
at them, reuerence them in
their places, honor them in their

vviſedomes, loue them in their
vertues, ſerue them in their worthineſſe,
and obey them in their
commaunds: leaſt finding thy
condition, they take order vvith
thy diſpoſition, vvhen to vveede
out ſuch a venemous Serpent, is
neceſſary for the preſeruing of
better ſpirits: for Murmurers are
like to Mutiners, vvhere one curſed
villaine may be the ruine of a
whole Camp; for which, if there
vvere not Martiall Lawe, there
vvere no life for the Souldior, nor
honour in Armes. Againe, doeſt
thou murmure at the Lawyer? oh
vvitleſſe creature, how wouldeſt
thou keepe thy Landes, Goods,
or Houſes? if there vvere no Law
to maintaine thy right? How

wouldeſt thou haue thy vvrongs
redreſſed, if there vvere no power
of Iuſtice? How ſhould the
King gouerne, and the Subiect
bee gouerned, but by the courſe
of Lawe? And are not the Iudges,
Counſellors, and true Adminiſters
of the Law, rather to
bee honoured for their learning,
and rewarded for their labours,
then to bee murmured at for
their ſeruice: But liue thou within
the limits of the Law, and thou
vvilt not murmure at their
Lawes: For vvho hateth the
Iudge but the Theefe, the Traytor,
the Coſener, or the Conſumer?
and therefore murmure at
thy ſelfe, and leaue murmuring at
Lawyers. Againe, doeſt thou

murmure at the vvord of God?
oh, child of the diuell? is it not
the key of Grace, that openeth
the gate of heauen? and the lamp
of Loue that giues light vnto the
way of life? Is it not the comfort
of the heart? and the food of the
Soule? and being a Iewell of ſuch
price, as all the vvorld cānot purchaſe;
a Treaſure of that vvorth,
that all the vvorld cannot value:
a ioy of that Nature, that dooth
rauiſh the Soules of the Elect:
What ſhall I ſay to thee? But,
thou art a Deuill incarnate, that
ſo farre from the Spirit of Grace,
canſt bee vngratefull for ſo gracious
a bleſsing, or murmure at
ſo glorious a gift of Mercie: for
to ſcorue the tidings of Saluation,

is to haſten the vvay vnto
Damnation? Note, vvhat it is to
murmure, and the eſtate of Murmurers.
Coran, Dathan, and Abiram,
murmured at Moſes: what
became of them? The earth ſwallowed
them. Pharaoh murmured
at the Iſraelites: What vvas
his reward? Drowned vvith all
his hoaſt in the red Sea. Joſephs
brethren murmured at him: what
became of them? They became
all his Seruants. Saule murmured
at Dauids tenne thouſands:
What vvas his end? Hee killed
himſelfe. Iudas murmured at the
Boxe of Oyle, that vvas poured
on Chriſts head: What vvas his
reward? Hee hanged himſelfe.
Take heede therefore, murmure

not at the Word, nor at the will
of God, leaſt thy reward bee
vvith the Reprobate: For if
thou murmure at God, the Deuill
vvill meete vvith thee; if thou
ſcorne the Word of God, vvickedneſſe
vvill follow thee; if thou
murmure at the grace of God,
Hell vvill gape to receiue thee.
Leaue therefore thy murmuring
at God, his Word, his Grace, or
his Will, leaſt vvith Lucifer, thou
bee throwne out of Heauen with
Caine bee accurſed, or vvith Eſau
looſe thy bleſsings on the Earth;
and learne vvith Abell to ſerue
God, vvith Abraham to beleeue
in God, vvith Dauid to loue
God, vvith Iob to feare God, with
Moyſes to honour God, and

vvith Chriſt to obey God; and
then ſhall the Deuill haue no
power to make thee murmure at
God. But let me come to particulars;
Doeſt thou murmure
at this man, or that man, for this
cauſe, or that cauſe? Oh vnhappie
vvretch, how doeſt thou
trouble thy ſelfe? Call thy wits
a little better together, and
vveigh thy thoughts in an euen
Ballance: If thou bee vviſer
then another, that is preferred
before thee, it may bee
hee is more Honourable: If
thou bee more Noble, hee
may bee more vviſe: If thou
more learned, hee more valiant:
If thou more valiant, hee
more vvealthie: If thou more

vvealthy, hee more honeſt; If
thou haſt a good face, hee may
haue a better body; if thou a
good body, he a better face; if
thou a good face and body, he a
better vvit; if thou a better vvit,
he a better heart; if thou an honeſt
heart, yet hee a more gracious
Soule: and therefore, if another
be aduaunced, and thou diſplaced,
haue patience, and murmure
not; for, vvhat knoweſt
thou vvhether God vvill bleſſe
his humilitie, and correct thy
pride, or make him ſwell till hee
burſt, and make a triall of thy
loue in the truth of thy patience▪
But let me ſee vvith thy murmuring,
vvhat manner of man hee
ſhould be, vvhom thou wouldeſt

haue moulded to thy minde; if
thou be tall of ſtature, then leſſe
then thou, are dwarfes; if low of
ſtature, thē tall men are Cyants;
if of a meane ſtature, then that
is the beſt proportion: So that
except all bee as thou art, thou
vvilt find fault vvith God in his
Creation, or Nature in her Generation,
or (through lacke of
vvit) vvith Fortune, in her Indiſcretion,
in preferring ſuch before
thee, as thou fondly thinkeſt
ſhould come behind thee: when,
if thou haddeſt thine owne eyes,
thou ſhouldeſt ſee in the glaſſe
of Truth ſo many imperfections
in thy ſelfe, as in the conceit of
vnworthineſſe, might make thee
rather come behind many, then

goe before any, and rather grieue
at thy ſelfe, then murmure at an
other: art thou finical & fantaſticall?
and wouldſt haue a man to
thine owne mind? what manner
of man ſhall he be? ſhaped like a
picture? countenanced like a
Bride? and talke like a Player?
oh fine foole, how thou wouldeſt
haue the ſigne of a man ſtand for
a man? and if thou be ſuch a one,
wouldeſt thou haue all like thy
ſelfe? alas, the world is ſo full of
fooles alreadie, that there is no
need of any more of them: and
therefore leaue thy murmuring,
and fal to ſome beter reckoning,
leaſt thy account come to worſe
then nothing, and while thou
art wiſe in thine owne conceit,

there may bee more hope of a
foole then of thee: doeſt thou
murmure to ſee a Traueller aduanced
for his vertue, while thou
art forgotten for thy ſeruice? perhaps
his knowledge is more
worth then thy toile, and he hath
taken paines, while thou haſt liued
at eaſe: art thou a Trauailer,
and murmureſt at the home ſeruant?
perhaps, hee hath gotten
more wealth at home, then thou
abroad, and taken paines at
home, while thou haſt had pleaſure
abroad; and what knovveſt
thou, vvhether the vviſedome of
State, or rather the vvill of God,
thinke it neceſſarie, to make a
Tryall of thy condition, ere
they revvarde thy deſerts: for

aduancement may bee a hurt to
Ambition, vvhile humilitie begins
her heauen in this vvorld.
Murmure not therefore at the
good of another, nor grieue at
the nature of thine own Croſſe:
for, vvhen patience doth kindly
carry it, it is the beſt badge of a
Chriſtian; and doeſt thou murmure
to ſee one of baſe Linage
come to honour, vvhile thou liueſt
in diſgrace? Take heed that
hee bee not the firſt, and thou
the laſt of a Noble Houſe, and
rather learne to thriue by his vertue,
then continue thy decay by
thine owne folly. In ſumme,
leaue thy murmuring at the vvill
of God, or the vvelfare of any
man, or at thine owne vvoe; for

God hath his vvoorking in all
things, and if thou vvilt be one
of his children, thou muſt louingly
allow of vvhat hee doth.
But now, as to men, let me a little
ſpeake to vvomen. Doeſt
thou being faire, murmure at the
preferment of a foule one, and
in thy rage call her foule dowde?
Alas, thinke Fortune had neede
to doe ſomewhat for her, vvhen
Nature is ſo little her friend. Againe,
it may bee her inward vertue
might be of more worth then
thy forced Beautie. Art thou a
foule one? and murmureſt at the
aduancement of a faire creature?
and in diſtemper of thy braine,
call her Picture? Fie vpon thee,
ſo ſhalt thou be no mans meate,

foule vvithout and vvithin: for
the euill mind is more foule, then
the blackeſt face; and if ſhee bee
vertuous vvith her beauty, is ſhee
not then vvorthie of Honor? Againe,
doſt thou murmure at the
vvealth of another, vvhile thou
art in pouertie? vvhy, it may bee
thou knovveſt not hovv ſhe gets
it, & perhaps, thy ſelfe vvouldeſt
not ſo haue it: doeſt thou murmure,
that ſhe is more ſuedto by
Louers? vvhy, it may be ſhe is loued
for change, and thou for
choiſe: doeſt thou murmure at
her that hath more children then
thou? perhaps thou deſerueſt
them not, or it may be God doth
not bleſſe thee to thy deſire. Rather
pray therefore then murmure,

leaſt a vvorſe plague befall
thee: doeſt thou murmure to ſee
a vvicked vvench put thee dovvn
in preferment? vvhat doeſt thou
knovv vvhether ſhe haue her heauen
in this vvorld, vvhich thou
ſeekeſt not, or begin her hell, ere
ſhe came at it? againe, it may be,
her repentance may be gratious,
vvhen thy pride may be odious:
And therfore be ſhe fair or foule;
vviſe, or fond; vvealthie or poore;
godly, or vvicked, Murmure not
at any vvhatſoeuer ſhee bee, in
vvhat ſtate ſoeuer thou thy ſelfe
be: leaſt, in fretting at others fortune,
thou conſume thy ſelfe
vvith follie, vvhile he that hateth
the grudging heart, plague
home the Spirite of mallice: but

leauing vvomen as the vveaker
veſſels, let mee come againe to
men, that ſhould haue the ſtronger
ſpirits, to withſtand the power
of Impatience. Note, I ſay, firſt
of murmuring, how many incontieniences
doe grow to the Murmurer
himſelfe, and then, to other,
by his meanes; and againe,
how great are the comforts of
the contrary: Murmuring troubleth
the minde, diſquiets the
heart, diſtempereth the bodie,
and ſometime breedes the conſumption
of the purſe; it forgetteth
reaſon, abuſeth nature, ſheweth
diſloialty, diſpleaſeth a friend,
and doth purchaſe an enemie: it
carrieth vvit from reaſon, Reaſon
from Grace, and Nature from her

ſelfe, yea & ſometime, man, euen
from God to the Deuill: while
patiēce enduring thoſe perplexities,
that put reaſon to his beſt
power; nature is not diſtempered,
reaſon not abuſed, grace is
embraced, and God is truely honoured,
the league of amitie is
continued, the law of nature is
not broken; Truth is gratious,
and the ſoule is bleſſed, where
the body is not diſtempered, nor
the mind diſturbed, the creature
is moſt able to giue glory to his
Creator: Note then the differences
of theſe two natures: Murmuring,
a horrible vice, and patience
a heauenly vertue; doe but
think on the fruit of murmuring,
and the condition, and end of

murmurers, rages, frettings, wars,
death, pouertie, ſicknes, and ſorrovv,
vvhile the child is ſicke of
the father, the vvife of the huſband,
the brother of the ſiſter,
and one friend of another; vvhat
maſſacre, or murther hath there
grovvne, but through the inuention
of murmuring, and the malice
of murmurers? looke a little,
if thou bee a murmurer, of vvhat
kind thou art, and vvho thou art,
and ſo note the condition of thy
nature, or nature of thy condition.
If thou be a man, and murmureſt
againſt God, thou art a
Deuill; if thou bee a Subiect, and
murmure againſt thy King, thou
art a Rebell; if thou bee a Sonne
and murmure againſt thy father,

thou ſheweſt a baſtards nature▪
If thou murmure againſt thy
Brother, an vnkind nature; if againſt
thy friend, an vnthankfull
nature; if againſt an honeſt
man, an vnhoneſt nature; if againſt
a foole, an vnwiſe nature;
if againſt a Chriſtian, a hetheniſh
nature; if againſt a man, a dogged
nature. Thus thou ſeeſt by
murmuring what thou ſhalt bee
eſteemed of God and man,
yea, and in thine ovvne conſcience,
of thy ſelfe, either a
Foole, a Knaue, a Heathen, a
Baſtard, a Traytor, a Dogge, of
a Deuill: and doeſt thou then
ſee the villanous nature and condition
of this qualitie, and wilt

not leaue it? take heede leaſt if
thou continue in it, that God vvil
hate thee for it, doe not ſend thee
to the deuill with it, who was the
firſt Author, and is the continual
nouriſher of it. Againe thinke
with thy ſelfe, when another man
ſhall find thee in thy murmuring,
either by thy diſcōtentiue countenance,
or ſoletarie delight, ſequeſtring
thy ſelfe from men, to
conuerſe with the Aire, hovv
great will be thy ſhame to heare
the skoffings, that will fall vpon
thy follie? Some will ſay thou art
mad, other, thou art fooliſh, another
thou art dogged, but noe
man, that thou art either wiſe,
kind, or well in thy wits: Againe,
when thou haſt reuealed thy folly

to the world, and fretted thy ſelfe
to the heart, with the humor of
an euill ſpirit, and yet art neuer
the better any way, but manie
way a greate deale the worſe,
what canſt thou thinke of thy
ſelfe? but fret that thou dideſt
fret? bluſh at thy ſhame? grieue
at thy follie, and murmure at thy
ſelfe, that thou didſt murmure at
thy ſelfe or any other, while repentāce
which bringeth ſorrow,
is the beſt fruit of ſuch a frenzie:
Againe, when thou ſhalt ſee the
patience of another bleſſed, and
thy murmuring accurſed, an others
patience enriched, and thy
impatience impoueriſhed, an others
patience aduanced, & thy
murmuring diſgraced, what canſt

thou thinke of it? but a Canker
eating into thy Soule worſe
then any Fistula in thy fleſhe:
pray then to the heauenly Surgeon
for a plaſter of patience,
with the oyle of true repentance
to cure thee of this diſeaſe,
which in the worlde, at
leaſt, by all the Arte of the
Worlde is Incurable: wilt thou
ſee a murmurer truely diſcribed?
that thou maieſt the better hate
to bee his image: Behold his
Eyes, like a hogge, euer bent
downewards as if he were looking
into Hell: his cheekes like
an Anathomie, where the fleſhe
from the bones doth fall, with
fretting; his browes euer wrinckled
with frownes, to ſhew the

diſtemper of his vnquiet Braine;
his lippes euer puld inward, as if
Enuie would ſpeake, and durſt
not; his tongue, like the ſting of
a Serpent, which vttereth nothing
but poiſon; his voice, like
the hiſſing of an Adder, which
maketh muſique but for hell; his
necke, like a weake piller, whereon
his head ſtands tottering, and
readie to fall; his breaſt like an
impoſtume, that is ready to burſt
with corruption; & his heart, the
Anuile wheron the deuill frames
his fireworke; his body a Trunk
where Sinne hath layed vp her
ſtore; his handes like clawes,
that catch at the world; and his
feete like vvinges, that make
haſt vnto hell: Now, doeſt thou

behold this ougly ſight? and doeſt
not feare to bee ſuch a monſter?
what ſhall I then ſay vnto
thee, but if God haue giuen thee
ouer to a reprobate ſence, there
is no reaſon to be had with thee,
nor hope of recouery to bee had
of thee; but, hoping a little better
in thee, let me goe a little further
with thee: The vvorde of
God ſaith Beati pacifici, bleſſed
are the peace makers, thinke then
it is a vvorke of the Deuill to
ſovv ſedition, and being at vvar
vvith thy ſelfe; hovv canſt thou
be at peace vvith the vvorld, except
it bee the good vvarre betvvixt
the ſpirite and the fleſh,
vvhere the peace of conſcience ouercomes
the trouble of conceit;

by patience is the Soule poſſeſt,
vvhich is more vvorth then the
vvhole vvorld, and by murmuring
is the ſoule loſt, vvhich gon,
vvhat is the gaine of the vvorld?
Is it not ſtrange that all the parts
and the members of the bodie,
can ſo vvell agree togither, and
one doe ſeruice to another, and
men, the parts and members of
a common-vvealth, ſhould be ſo
at variance among themſelues? In
the body of man, if the head ake,
the heart is not vvell, if the Eye
be hurt, the head is diſtempered,
the heart is diſeaſed, and all
the body is the vvorſe, if the finger
bee hurt, the head vvill ſeeke
to help it, the heart hath a feeling
of it, the Eye vvil pittie it, and the

feete vvill goe for eaſe for it; if
the foote bee hurt, the Head,
Heart, and Hands will ſeeke for
cure of it, while the Eye vvill be
carefull to look to the dreſſing of
it; If the body bee diſeaſed, the
head vvith all the members vvill
labour for the helpe of it, that all
parts being in their perfect ſtate,
the mind or Soule may be at reſt:
& if in this priuate body of man,
all things bee brought vnto this
good order, vvhat ſhame is it
for a common-vvealth, that men
ſhould bee ſo out of order? and
vvhile all parts of the bodie are
at the ſeruice of the head, to the
great peace of the heart, vvhy
ſhould not all Subiects ioyne togither

in vnity of ſeruice to their
King, to the greate and bleſſed
peace of the vvhole Kingdome?
God made all the parts
of the bodie for the Soule, and
vvith the Soule to ſerue him,
and all the Subiects in a Kingdome
to ſerue their King, and
with their King to ſerue him.
If the head of the bodie ake,
vvill not the heart bee greatly
greeued? and euerie part feele
his part of the paine of it? and
ſhall a King in his vvill bee diſpleaſed,
and the hearte of his
kingdome, the heartes of his
Subiects, not haue a feeling
of it? Canne the Eye of the
bodie bee hurt, or greeued,

and neither the head, heart, nor
any other member bee touched
vvith the paine of it? No more
can the Counſell, the Eye of the
common vvealth bee diſturbed;
but the King vvill find it, and the
Common-vvealth vvill feel it;
can the hand, the Artificer, bee
hurt? but the common-vvealth
vvill find the lacke of it, the Eye
with pittie vvil behold it, and the
head vvith the eye, the King vvith
the Counſell take care for the
help of it? Can the labourer, the
foote be vvounded? but the body
of the State vvill feele it, the head
be carefull, the eye ſearchfull, and
the hand bee painfull in the cure
of it? and the common-vvealth?
the body bee diſeaſed, but the

King, his Counſell, and euerie
true Subiect, vvill put to his hand
for the helpe of it? hovv then
grovves this murmuring at the
vvill of God in men? vvhile there
is ſuch an agreement of the parts
in man, but only by the vvorke of
the deuill in man, to bring him
from God and the vvorlde, to
vvorke againſt himſelfe, his ſeruice
in the vvorld, and as hee
taught it firſt our parēts to bring
them out of paradiſe, ſo he vvil as
many as he can of their poſterity,
to lead them into Hell: But let
mee tell thee, it is better that a
fevv murmurers periſh vvith their
murmuring, then a vvhole kingdome
periſh vvith their mallice:
In the holy vvord I find vvritten;

If thine Eye offend thee, pull it
out; if thy hand offend thee, cut
it off: better to enter into heauen
vvith one hand, or one eye, then
vvith both into hell. But all this
vvhile, there is nothing ſpokē of
the head, that muſt ſtill bee kept
on: ſo if a great man, or a meane
man do offēd, cut him off, or cut
him ſhort, that he may do no hurt;
for better a mēber periſh, thē the
head or the hart ſhould ake, then
either the King, or the commonvvealth
ſhould bee diſeaſed: but
for the King hovvſoeuer hee bee
diſpoſed, hee muſt not bee diſturbed:
for it is vvritten, Touch
not mine annointed, and do my Prophets
no harme: againe, tranſgreſſiō
is as the ſin of vvitchcraft;

and vvhat greater tranſgreſſion,
then Rebellion? vvhich chiefly
hath her breeding in murmuring.
If thou haſt a cruell & vvicked
King, take him for a puniſhment,
and pray for his amendment;
but murmure not at his
povver: but if thou haſt a good
King, take him as a bleſſing; and
hauing a good King, be thankful
to God for him, & for his proſperity,
ſerue him, loue him, & obey
him, & hate thy ſelfe to haue
a thought of murmuring againſt
him, or any thing cōmanded by
him: looke a little more into thy
glaſſe of murmuring, & ſee (if at
laſt thou haſt the leaſt ſparke of
Gods grace) vvhat thou beholdeſt:
God in the heauēs frowning

upon thee, his angels either murmuring
for thee, or readie to
plague thee, his ſeruants on the
Earth hating thee, and the deuill
vvith his angells readie to diſtroy
thee; thy Soule made a Receptacle
of ſinne, thy mind made
a torment to thy Soule, thy heart
made a greefe to thy bodie, and
euerie part of thy bodie out of
temper: while being driuen out
of the ground of all goodneſſe,
Thou ſhalt bee left in the maze
of al wickedneſſe, where, looſing
the hope of all cōfort, thou ſhalt
liue in the hell of all miſerie; yet,
a little look further into thy ſelfe,
and into the vileneſſe of thy nature,
if it be touched with that infection:
If the weather pleaſe

thee not, thou wilt murmure at
the heauens: if the world goe not
with thee, thou willt murmure at
the vvorlde; if thy friend rebuke
thee, thou vvllt murmure
at his care of thee: If thine enemy
ouercome thee, thou wilt murmure
at his fortune; If thy Father
bee aged, thou wilt murmure at
his life; If thy brother be thine elder,
thou wilt murmure at his Inheritance;
If thy neighbour grow
rich, thou wilt murmure at his
proſperitie; If a Stranger bee fauored,
thou wilt murmure at his
grace, if a Begger bee releeued,
thou wilt murmure at his Almes;
and if a godly man bee beloued,
thou wilt murmure at Gods bleſſing;
If thou bee a woman, or a
womaniſh man, then how many

things will trouble thee? thou
wilt murmure at faſhions, coulors,
toies, tricks, words, geſtures,
and a world of ſuch idle fancies,
whē alwaies the other is the beſt,
& nothing pleaſeth but variety:
hee, or ſhee hath the beſt face, the
beſt eye, the beſt hand, the beſt
legge, the beſt body, or the beſt
foote, ſpeakes beſt, hath the beſt
countenance, ſings beſt, dances
beſt, rides beſt, feeds finelieſt,
goes gaieſt, hath apparrell the
beſt made, and weares it beſt: &
thus all is beſt wher there is none
good; while, that, which ſhould
be beſt, ſerues God beſt, is not
ſpokē of: for indeed, who ſerueth
God beſt, will not let his ſpirit be
led away with theſe idle humors:
doſt thou thē ſee the follie of this

murmuring, and the hurt of ſo
great a poyſon? ſeeke the cure of
it by prayer, & keep it from thee
by patience; leaſt if it once get
hold of thy heart, it breed a cureles
woūd in thy Soule: If thou be
a king, keepe thy ſeate; If a Courtier,
know thy place; if a Scholler
plie thy booke; if a Souldier, look
to thine honor; If a marchāt, take
thy fortune; if a farmer follow thy
plough; if a beggar, fal to prayer▪
but murmur not, oh King, if thou
be not an Emperor; nor courtier
if thou haue not grace; nor Scholler
if thou want preferment; nor
Souldier if thou looſe thy day;
nor Marchāt, if thou looſe goods;
nor farmer, if thou loſe thy labor;
nor beggar if thou get bare alms:
but murmuring at Gods wil; take

heede that thou looſe not thine
owne ſoule, more precious to
thee, then the whole world: Is it
not ſtrange to ſee the inſenſible
Creatures, what a concord there
is, and among the Creatures of
beſt ſence, ſo great a diſagreement:
In muſique the Treble is
the higheſt, and the baſe the loweſt;
the Tenor and Counter-Tenor
betvveen thē: yet though
euery one hath his place, when
they are in their full concord,
they make the ſweeteſt harmony:
ſo in a Kingdome: a King is
the higheſt, and the labourer the
lovveſt: (I leaue out the Beggar
as an vnneceſſary member, but
only for the exerciſe of Charity)
bur, betwixt the King and the

labourer, there are Counſailers,
Preachers, Lawyers, Souldiars,
Marchants, and Artificers, and
when all theſe togither in due allegeance
to their King, doe true
ſeruice vnto God, hovv excellent
a muſique is the ſound of peace
in ſuch a kingdom: If the ſtrings
be out of tune, the muſique will
be harſh, and if the people bee
out of order, the State cannot be
in peace: Thinke then, if among
theſe inſēſible Creatures be ſuch
an vnity as is moſt pleaſing, why
ſhould not among men bee ſo
great an vnion? that may bee as
well pleaſing as profitable? wee
canne bee contented with the
gold of India, the Sugar of Barbary,
the oyle of Candie, the Spices

of Spaine, the vvine of France,
and ſo, of other things, of other
Countries, to mingle with our
owne, to make a medicine for the
comfort or preſeruatiue of our
bodies, & can we not vnite vnto
our ſelues, a people ſo like our
ſelues, & ſo neer vnto our ſelues,
as might be to vs as our ſelues; if
we vvould looke vvith the eye of
Charity, vvhat bleſſing doth
grovv of loue: nothing did part
our land, but a little vvater, and
nothing can part our loue, but a
little vvill: but, as it may be ſaid,
of a more wilfull then wiſe man,
who hauing a coat made all of
one peece, vvas perſvvaded by a
Tailor to haue it cut in peeces,
and vveare guardes vpon the

ſeames; onely to ſet himſelfe on
vvorke, and make againe of the
ſhreds, giuing that part another
name, then before it had, that was
nevv ſet on againe; So, I may
ſay, this Land, once all one, and
by vvhat perſwaſion, I know not
cut off, was ſo lōg guarded, that
it ſeemed to bee of ſome other
ſtuffe, then the vvhole peece, till
it pleaſed God by the great power
of his Grace, in the Maieſtie of
our King to bring both Landes
againe into one: vvhich done, it
now reſteth, that the guards takē
away, no ſeame of diſſeuering be
to be ſeen▪ but, the Lands, as one
peece of Earth, enlarging the
boūds of one Kingdom, the people
be vnited in that vniō, that, to

auoid ambition, there be no diſſention,
and to maintaine an vnitie,
there be no Rebellion: for, as
there is one God, one King, and
one kingdome: ſo, there ſhould
bee one law, one loue, and one
life, one voice, one heart, and one
people: to the cōtradictiō wherof,
whē all reaſons are alleadged,
it is only lacke of loue, that hindereth
the heauen of ſuch a happines;
But, what euer thou bee,
that murmureſt at this motion,
let me ſay vnto thee, as the poore
woman of Ireland ſayes to her
dead husband: oh man, man,
why didſt thou die? Thou hadſt
Cowes, and thou hadſt a horſe;
thou hadſt a ſword, and a ſhirt of
male, and vvhy vvouldeſt thou

die? ſo thou haſt a good King, a
ſweet Country, a kind people,
and a bleſſed peace, and vvhy
doeſt thou murmure? doeſt thou
feare to haue many friends? then
get the among enemies, art thou
vnwilling to haue many neighbours?
then liue among ſtrangers:
doſt thou loue no Chriſtians,
then dvvell among Turkes;
or doeſt thou loue no men? then
liue among Deuills; or doſt thou
loue no houſe but home? make
thy graue in thy bed; vvilt thou
eate no meate but milke? Baby,
ſucke thy dambe, till thou bee a
dizard; vvilt thou abide no company,
but thine one kindred? lap
thy ſelfe in thy mothers apron;
or doeſt thou doubt thy neighbour

vvill ouerthrovv thee? oh,
let not lacke of witte ſo deceiue
thee: for if God hath not ſo bleſt
thee, as to make thee know what
is good for thee, thou needeſt
nothing more then thy ſelfe to
vndoe thee: conſider therefore of
euery thing, if thou canſt in the
beſt kind, and make thy conſtruction
vvith that care, that
God firſt may bee pleaſed, thy
King obeyed, thy Country benefited,
and thy ſelfe contented:
That vvhen the murmuring of
malice is put avvay, and patience
hath brought peace into thy boſome,
thy hart may find the happines
of that bleſſing, that thy
Soule may be ioyfull to behold
vvhere, the people vnited, God is

ſerued, the Kingdome preſerued,
& the State moſt bleſſed, vvhere
ſuch a peace is applauded. The
Seas are a vvall vnto our Earth, to
keep it from the enimies, & ſhall
vve vvithin our land be at vvarres
vvithin our ſelues? or ſhall vvee
make a ſhevv of loue in our
vvords, and harbour hatred in
our hearts? or ſhall vve be borne
neighbours, & liue as ſtrangers?
God forbid: let not the Deuil ſo
vvorke among the ſeruantes of
God, to croſſe the courſe of ſuch
a peace, as is ſo much to Gods
glory: Our heuēly maſter Chriſt
Ieſus king of kings, vvare his coat
vvithout a Seame, and our King
vvould haue his Kingdom vvithout
a Seuerance: It is the vvorde

of Chriſt; that vvhen a kingdom
is deuided in it ſelfe, it cannot
ſtand: If therefore vvee will bee
chriſtiās; we muſt follow Chriſt;
if vve will be ſubiects, we muſt obey
our King; if vvee vvill ſtand,
vvee muſt not bee deuided: For
example, to alleadge ancient hiſtories
offorrain Princes, at leaſt
a farre of is needles, when neere
hand before our Eyes that cannot
deceiue our Iudgements:
hovv grevv the vvars in the Low
Countries? but, by the malice of
murmurers? hovv grevv the maſſacres
in France? but, by the deuiſion
of the Princes, and noble
houſes; and hovv many broyles
haue beene betvvixt Scotland &
vs, vvhile vvee vvere in the State

of deuiſion? Againe, hovv ſtrong
are the States vvhere they are vnited
in the Lovv Coūtries, hovv
is France inriched by his peace?
and hovv are vve; or at leaſt may
bee vvith GODS bleſſing
ſtrengthened by this vnion?
Eſope telleth a prettie tale to this
purpoſe: That a Father hauing
many ſonnes often diſagreeing,
and as it vvere at iarre one vvith another,
called them before him,
and cauſed euery one to bring
vnto him, a little rod, or vvand,
vvhich taken of them, he bound
them vp altogither in one bundel;
vvhich made faſt vvith a bād,
he gaue to euery one of his ſons,
one after another to breake;
vvhich they found impoſſible:

whereupon the Father tooke out
euerie rod, and gaue one to each
one of his ſonnes to breake, which
was quicklie performed: Now
quoth the father, ye ſee my ſōnes
of vvhat a ſtrength is loue, vvher
heartes are vnited togither; for as
theſe vvandes, ſo are yee; ſtrong
vvhen yee are knit togither in the
band of brotherly loue, & vveake
and to be broken, vvhen you are
diuided one from another▪ Surelie
ſo it may be ſaid of vs: If vve
be vnited, and knitte togither in
the band of brotherlie loue, our
ſtrength vvill be great to vvithſtand
our enimies; but if vve fall
at variance, vvhat peace can continue
betvvixt vs? nay vvhat hurt
ſhal vve do vnto our ſelues, vvhile

the enimie vvill be ready to inuade
vs? It is vvritten. O quam
bonum et iucundū? fratres concordare
in vnum? Oh hovv bleſſed a
thing it is bretheren to agree in
vnitie? Are vve not all bretheren
in Chriſt? bretheren in reſpect of
our neere birth? bretheren in our
language? & is it not poſsible for
our liues to make vs bretheren in
loues? Let vs ſee, vvher is the fault,
vvhat is the cauſe? and vvhy it
ſhould take place? In God? no,
hee loueth vnity: In the King?
no, hee vvould haue an Vnion:
In the Subiectes? noe, they
vvould bee obedient to their
King: In the Godlie? noe,
they vvould bee obedient to
GODS vvill: In vvhome

then? Surely in none, except in
ſome priuate perſons for ſome
priuate cauſes, to ſome priuate
endes: oh then thoſe priuate perſons
are not for the publique
vveale: thoſe priuate cauſes for
no common good, and thoſe
priuate ends, are for no godly
end, but hoping there are none
ſuch: I ſpeake to none, but vviſh
all vvell, that all may be vvell: Is
not our Religion all one? and
ſhall vvee differ in Ceremonies?
and if our Lavves vvere all
one, ſhould vve differ in the execution?
our earth all as one, and
ſhall vvee then differ in nature?
vvhat ſhould bee the cauſe? but
this; vvhile God is vvorking, and
the King is vvilling, the Deuill

is ſtirring, and man is ſtriuing,
but, God is aboue the Deuil, and
a King is aboue his kingdome;
and vvhile God is God, and the
King gratious, though the Deuill
bee vvicked, let not man bee
vvilfull. A true loues knot is long
in knitting, vvhen both endes
muſt meete in the middeſt: but
once vvell put togither, it is both
faire and faſt: So, an vnion of
people is long a vvorking, but
once ſaſt lincked in Ioue, vvhere
farre and neere meet in the middeſt
of a good mind, hovv beautiful
is ſuch a peace, vvhere the
people are ſo bleſſed? let then al
murmurers be ſhut out from the
ſound of ſuch a Parlee, vvhere
vviſedome may ſhevv her grace

in the worke of ſuch a worth for
it muſt bee that our King▪ and
theirs, is, and muſt be (and euer
I pray God be) al one: our Religion
and theirs one: and our
lavves and theirs all one: els how
can there be loue in our liues? or
vnion in our hearts? but I hope,
that God who did create our
hearts by his will, will ſo vvorke
our hearts to his will, that wee
ſhall not ſwarue from his will: but
as hee hath made all into one
kingdome; ſo vve ſhall bee all as
one people, vvith one voice praiſing
God, vvith one heart ſeruing
one King, and vvith one
loue, embraſing one another:
Many little birdes flie togither
in one flocke, many kindes of

cattell feed in one field: many
kinde of ſheepe lie togither in
one fold, and ſhall tvvo neighbour
borne Children, not liue
togither in one loue? God forbid:
It is an old ſaying, and euer
true, Concordia paruae res creſcunt,
diſcordia maxima dilabuntur:
by Concord ſmall things
proue greate, by diſcord the
greateſt doe decay: Tvvo little
Landes haue made a greate
Kingdome, and ſhall one great
people bee little in loue? God
forbid: The Landes vvere deuided,
and are vnited; and if the
people may bee vnited, let
them not be diuided: Diuiſion
breeds Ambition, Emulation,

and faction, and vvhat are the
fruits of theſe frenzies? hovv many
kingdomes to their great miſery
haue taſted? but vniō breeds
loue Charitie, & faith, of vvhich
bleſſings vvhat are the benefits,
vvhat kingdome may not bee
glad to taſt? A King of a deuided
peopl
                  •
                may haue povver in
his ſvvord, but a king of vnion
may reioyce in his Scepter: a
people deuided may be grieuous
to themſelues, but a people vnited
may be pleaſing to God: diuiſion
is the cauſe of diſtruction,
and vnion of Comfort: compare
them then togither, & ſee vvhich
is to be accepted: diuiſiō breeds
feare, and ielouzie; vnion breeds
the reſolution and truſt: diuiſion

breeds warre and hatred; vnion
breeds peace and loue: diuiſion
breeds dearth, and danger; vnion
plentie, and ſafety; diuiſion
breeds malice and murther: vnion
breeds loue, and life: diuiſion
breeds greefe and ſorrow, vnion
breeds mirth and Comfort:
Thinke then vpon the venom of
the one, and the vertue of the other;
and if thou bee not ſenceles
of thine owne good, runne not
headlong vpon thine own ill: deſire
not rather to liue in the hatefull
nature of diuiſion, then to
bee lincked in the liuely knot of
vnion; leaſt the God of loue that
offers it, and thy louing King,
that deſireth it, both hate thee
for refuſing it, and deny thee it

vvhen thou vvouldeſt haue it:
The Tovver of Babell could not
be builded, vvhen the languages
vvere diuided: Jeruſalem vvent
to ruine vvhen the Princes vvere
diuided, Rome hath beene ſhaken
ſince Religon hath beene
diuided: Antwerpe hath beene
decayed, ſince the States vvere
diuided: France vvas impoueriſhed,
vvhen the Nobles were
diuided, and England vvas diſturbed,
when Scotland vvas diuided:
but now the Landes all
bearing one name, the Subiects
all one, vnder one King, the laws
all tending to one ende; vvhy
ſhould not the Nations bee all
one people? Flowers grovve
ſvveetely together, Trees beare

fruite naturally together, fiſhes
ſwim friendly togither, birdes
ſing merrily together; & beaſts
ſeede quietly together, and is it
not then a ſhame for men, that
vvee cannot liue louingly togither?
a drop of water is weake,
but many droppes of water will
driue a mill: a ſparke of fire is
little, but many ſparkes together,
will make a fire to conſume
a whole Countrie: a corne
of powder is little, but a great
many together will diſcharge a
great ſhot: a herring is a ſmal fiſh,
but a skull of them together
vvill ouerthrovve a prettie ſhip:
a pike is a ſmall vveapon, yet
a ſtande of them being together
vvill ouerthrovve a greate

Troope: and a man is a ſmall
Creature; but where men hold
togither, what monſter can hurt
them? So theſe Lands being one
land, and the people one people;
what kingdome can annoy vs?
no let vs ſay, and if wee bee our
ſelues, to our ſelues, and in peace
among our ſelues, and that our
God be with vs; neither the world
nor the Deuill can hurt vs: But
if there bee a breach in a banke,
the Sea breaks in, & ouerflowes
the Land: If there be a breach in
a furnace, the fire will burſt out,
and burne the whole houſe: If
there bee a breach in a wall, the
Bore will breake in, and ſpoile
the whole vineyard: If there be a
breach in a hedge, the cattel vvill

breake in and eate vp the graſſes
if there be a breach in a Fort, the
enemie will enter and ſacke the
Towne: if there bee a breach among
pikes, the horſemen will
breake in, and ruine the Campe:
If there bee a breach in a conſcience,
Corruption will get in,
and kil the whole man: & if ther
be a breach of loue in the hearts
of a people, the enemie will take
aduantage for the inuaſion of the
kingdome. See then, and conſider
hovv dangerous a thing is
diuiſion, and hovv ſafe an aſſurance
is vnitie; and take the beſt,
and leaue the worſt; and ſo ſhall
none of your pales bee broken▪
oh heauens, vvhat a hell is this in
the vvorld? that men ſhould liue

ſo like Deuills one one vvith another:
It is written that a man
ſhould bee as a God vnto man,
but it may bee vvriten, that man
is, or at leaſt many men are, as
Deuills vnto men: vvhere there
are ſo many murmurers, that ther
can be fevv louers; the rich man
murmures at the poore man, that
hee ſhould dwell nigh him: the
Vſurer murmures at the Broker;
that he g
                  ••
               eth any thing by him:
the Tradeſman murmures at his
neighbour, that he ſhould proſper
or thriue by him: the Lavvyer
murmures at the Tearme that
it is ſo ſhort a harueſt for him:
The Marchant murmures at
the vvindes, that his Shippes
come not home to him: the

Souldiour murmures at the pay-maiſter,
that hee keepes his
money from him: The Courtier
murmures at his Taylor,
that his clothes are not fit for
him: The Miniſter he murmures
at the Parſon, becauſe hee hath
the greateſt profit from him: and
the Parſon murmures at the
pariſhe, that they come not to
Church to pay their duties to
him; and the pariſhe murmures
at the Parſon, that they pay ſo
much, for ſo little paines from
him: the Tenant murmures at
his Landlorde for racking of his
rent: the Landlord murmures at
his Tenant to ſee him thriue by
his husbandry. In ſumme there
is almoſt no profeſsion or cōdition
wherin one doth not murmre

at an other; which murmuring
vvhile it continueth in the hearts
of people, it vvill ſuffer loue to
haue no life among them: but
were the vvorlde purged of that
malicious humor, then vvould
there bee as great a heauen, as
thereis novv a hell in the vvorld;
vvher loue ſhould eſtabliſh ſuch
a Lavv, as ſhould neuer bee broken:
among men; doe not tvvo
Eyes in one head, two hands, and
two legges to one bodie make
one man; and ſhall not two lands
make one kingdome; nay more;
doth not one Eye the ſame that
the other, the one hād, the ſame
that the other, and ſhall not one
peple ſo nere another, as one mē
               ber
is to another, haue one vvill,
one lavv, and one loue one vvith

another? It is ſtrange it ſhould
be ſo, But I hope it vvill bee othervviſe;
God vvill haue his
vvill, and our good King his wil:
in this vvorke of GODS vvill,
euery good Chriſtian, and good
Subiect vvill giue his good will
to Gods and our Kings will; againſt
vvhich, if any ſhall murmure,
God vvill bee diſpleaſed
that the King is not obeyed; the
King vvill bee diſpleaſed, that
God is not obeyed: the Counſel
vvill be diſpleaſed, that God and
the king are not obeied: the court
vvill be agreeued to ſee God, the
king, and Counſell diſpleaſed:
and the Common-vvealth vvill
haue a common vvoe, when all
theſe are diſpleaſed. Looke therfore

betimes to this buſines, detract
no time for this diſpatch,
ſuppreſſe the power of the diuels
pride; and plant in your hearts
that grace of humilitie, that in the
life of true loue, may bring forth
fruite to Gods glorie. Breake an
Angel, and you ſhall haue loſſe
in the mettall; breake a Cup, and
you ſhall haue loſſe in the faſhiō;
breake a Glaſſe, you ſhall looſe
the faſhion and the Mettall;
breake wedlocke, and you looſe
your credit; breake the Lawe,
and looſe your libertie; breake
Loue, and looſe the joye of
life: But keepe your Coyne
whole, and it will goe currant;
keepe your Cup vvhole, and
you ſhall ſaue the faſhion; keepe

your Glaſſe whole, and you
ſhall ſaue Mettall and faſhion;
keep your wedlocke from breaking,
and ſaue your credit from
cracking; keepe your Lawe frō
breaking, and your loue will be
great; keepe your Loue from
breaking, and your liues vvill
be bleſſed: Diuide the head, &
the Braines vvil come out; diuide
the Body, and the heart vvill
come out; diuide the Minde, &
the vvittes vvill come out; diuide
the Wittes, and the vvilles
come out; and diuide the Willes,
and the vvoes come out▪ but
keepe the head vvhole, and the
Braines vvill bee the better;
keepe the Body vvhole, the
heart vvill bee the better;

keepe the minde quiet, the vvits
will be the better; keepe the wits
in temper, the vvilles be the better,
and keepe the wils togither,
the common-wealth vvil bee the
better. Note therefore in al cauſes,
& al courſes, diuiſion breeds
loſſe, greefe, or ſorrovv: and vnion,
gain, comfort, and ioy. But
I doubt I haue onely ſpoken of
that vvhich vvould quickly bee
helped, if the right vvay vvere
once found: and therefore it is
rather the manner, then the matter,
that the vvorkeman cannot agree
vpon: but to helpe the ill
hammering of a peece of vvorke
ſo vvorth the framing, let mee
make a compariſon betvvixt a
houſe and a kingdome: There is

a greate Landlord will haue a
houſe builded, his will muſt bee
obeyed, hee giues commaund
vnto the maiſter workeman
that it bee ſpeedely performed:
The maiſter vvorkeman calls
his labourers, and giues order
for the worke, euery one in his
place, and according to his qualitie:
Now vvhen the worke is in
hand, Timber, Stone, Bricke,
Lime, and water, Iron, Glaſſe,
and Leade, and all is readie that
is neceſſarie: If either the workmen
bee vnwilling to worke, or
cannot agree vpon their worke,
there will no houſe bee built:
But if they fal to their buſines, &
agree vpon the direction, the

                  •…
               ame will ſoone vp: Euen ſo the

                  •
               ord God, our Sauiour Ieſus

Chriſt, the great Landlord, and
Lord of Heauen and Earth, will
haue a commonwealth builded,
and his will muſt be obeyed: for
performance whereof, hee hath
giuen commaundement to his
ſeruant, and our Soueraigne
Lord King Iames in this world,
vnder God onely workemaiſter
of this vnion: where if either the
people be vnwilling to yeeld vnto
the courſe or order ſet dovvne
by the workemaiſter, or among
themſelues diſagree vpon the
manner of their working, whatſoeuer
faire vvords be vſed, whatſoeuer
good reaſons be alleadged,
or vvhatſoeuer ſhews of loue
be made, there vvill bee no true
league of friendſhip, nor peace
for the ground of a Common-wealth:

but let the labourers be
willing to bee directed by their
vvorke-maiſter, and euery one in
his place, ſhevv the beſt of his
good vvill; and no doubt, but
ſuch a common-vvealth vvill bee
built, as while God doth bleſſe it,
all the vvorld ſhall not hurt it.
Conſider therefore the inconueniences
of diuiſion, and the comforts
and commodities of vnion,
and let not ſelfe-will carrie you away
from the courſe of wiſedom:
you ſee, if you vvill ſtill murmure
againſt this ſo gratious an action,
hovv many are againſt you?
God himſelfe, who loues vnitie:
the King, vvho vvould haue an vnion:
Subiects, that loue their
King, and godly men that loue

God, for they vvill bee obedient
to his will: the flowers of the field
are againſt you, for they will
grow togither; the trees, for they
vvill beare fruite togither; the
fiſhe, for they vvil ſwim togither;
the birdes, for they vvill ſing togither:
and is it not then a ſhame
for men, that vve cannot liue and
loue togither. For ſhame then
goe from your ſelues vnto God,
and goe from the Deuill vnto
man: and in the name of God agree
togither; liue vnder one
God, one King, one law, and
one loue: ſo ſhall God beſt bee
pleaſed, the King beſt contented,
the kingdome beſt gouerned,
and euery vviſe and honeſt
man beſt ſatisfied: vvhere liuing

in murmuring and malecontent,
God may be diſpleaſed, the king
diſquieted, the State diſturbed;
and fevv men but ſome vvay diſcontented:
vvhat ſhall I ſay, to
conclude, but this? Is not vnion
a kind of marriage, vvrought
by the hands of God? and performed
in the hearts of his people?
I ſay, a marriage where
hearts ioyning hands, make two
bodies as one: and is not a kind
attonement, better then an vnkind
diuorcement: let then theſe
tvvo kingdomes be one, marrie
them in loue, and ſince our King
is the Father that giues them,
vvhile God himſelfe doth vnite
them, what Subiect or Chriſtian
can be ſo vngratious, as not to

giue his conſent to them? yea let
mee ſay vvith the miniſter in the
time of marriage: if any man
knovv any lavvfull, or iuſt cauſe,
vvhy theſe two Landes, now one
kingdome, ſhould not in marriage
be lincked vvith ſuch a loue,
as may make them liue vnder
one lavv, and dvvell togither as
one people, let him novv ſpeake,
or euer hereafter hold his peace:
But if there bee any man, that
knovving no iuſt, nor lavvfull
cauſe, vvill out of the malicious
humor of a vvicked ſpirit, hating
to ſee a heauenly Action vpon
earth, murmur at the bleſſed proceeding
of ſo gratious a worke,
the God of peace make him for
euer hold his peace.
            Amen
