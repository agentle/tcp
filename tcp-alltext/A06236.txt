            WHereas the Company of Painter-Stainers have been an antient Brotherhood in this City, and for the
better Exerciſe of the

                  •
                and Government of thoſe that uſe the ſame Art of Painting of latter times
have been Incorporated, the better to enable them for the Exerciſing and Ordering of that Trade, and
performance thereof by Men of Skill and Cunning. But of late years, by reaſon that divers Freemen of this
City do daily practiſe, uſe, and exerciſe Painting in and about the ſame; neither have been brought up as Apprentices
to the ſaid Art, nor being free of the Company of Painter-Stainers, but of ſundry other Companies of
this City: which Freemen of other Companies uſing Painting as aforeſaid, have taken upon them, and daily
do, to have and keep more number of Apprentices, than the Freemen of the ſaid Company of Painter-Stainers,
uſing the ſaid Art of Painting, by the Ordinances of their ſaid Tompany lawfully may or can do, to the peſtring
and filling of this City with Men of that Faculty and Profeſſion, and to the great prejudice and hindrance of the
Freemen of the Company of Painter-Stainers: by reaſon whereof much bad and deceitful Workmanſhip is daily
practiſed and uſed within this City, which ariſeth principally by reaſon thoſe Freemen of other Companies are
not ſubject to the Search and Ordinances of the ſaid Company of Painter-Stainers, ſo that their Defaults and
Abuſes cannot be diſcovered, eſpied, or amended; nor the Offenders puniſhed according to their Demerits, as
they ſhould be, in caſe they were ſubject to the ſaid Company of Painter-Stainers. For Remedy and Reformation
whereof, and to the intent that all Freemen of this City, practiſing and uſing the Art of Painting within this
City, may be in time reduced, and brought to be free of the Company of Painter-Stainers; and that the Maſter
and Wardens of the ſaid Company for the time being, may hereafter have a more free and abſolute Survey
and Search, and Correction and Puniſhment of all Freemen of this City, uſing their Art within the ſame
City and Liberties thereof, (of what Company ſoever they be) than heretofore they have had, whereby Frauds
and Of
                  •
               ences may come to be diſcovered, and Offenders puniſhed, according to the ancient Cuſtoms of this
City in like Caſes uſed: Be it Enacted, Ordained, and Eſtabliſhed by the Right Honourable the Lord Mayor,
the Aldermen his Brethren, and the Commons in this Common Council aſſembled, and by the Authority of the
ſame, That all Perſons free of this City, (of what Company ſoever they be) uſing the ſaid Art of Painter-Stainers
within this City and Liberties thereof, and making gain thereby, ſhall from henceforth be under the Survey and
Search of the Maſter and Wardens of the ſaid Company of Painter-Stainers for the time being; and ſhall from
time to time be ſubject to the Ordinances of the ſaid Company, touching the Exerciſe of the ſaid Art of Painting
only. And be it further Enacted, by the Authority aforeſaid, That no Perſon or Perſons whatſoever, being Free of
any Company of this City whatſoever, (other than of the ſaid Company of Painter-Stainers,) which doth or ſhall
uſe or practiſe the ſaid Art of Painters, within this City and Liberties thereof, and ſhall make gain thereby, ſhall
from henceforth take and bind any Apprentice or Apprentices to him, or themſelves, but within one month after the
taking of ſuch Apprentice, and before the binding of ſuch Appretice or Apprentices, ſhall firſt preſent him or them
before the Maſter and Wardens of the ſaid Company of Painter-Stainers, at the Common-Hall of the ſaid Tompany;
and upon ſu
                  •
               h Preſentation of any Apprentice or Apprentices at the Place aforeſaid, the ſame Apprentice
or Apprentices ſhall become bound by Indenture to the Maſter or one of the Wardens of the ſaid Company, for
the time being, for the Term and number of Years agreed upon between the ſaid Maſter and Apprentice or Apprentices,
and the Party ſo preſenting him or them: And that after the binding of ſuch Apprentice or Apprentices
in form before declared, the ſaid Apprentice or Apprentices ſhall at the Charges of the Maſter ſo preſenting the
ſame Apprentice, be by the Party to whom he was bound ſet over before the Chamberlain of the ſaid City of
London for the time being, to the Party by whom he ſhall be ſo preſented, and him ſhall ſerve the reſidue of his
Term, to the intent that at the expiration of the ſaid Term, the ſaid Apprentice or Apprentices may be made
free of the ſaid Company of Painter-Stainers. And be it further Enacted, by the Authority aforeſaid, That if
any Perſon or Perſons uſing the Art of Painting within this City or Liberties thereof, and not being free of
the ſaid Company of Painter-Stainers, ſhall at any time or times hereafter take any Apprentice or Apprentices
bound unto himſelf, or in any other manner than is before declared, he or they ſhall forfeit for every Apprentice
ſo bound the Sum of Twenty Pounds of lawful Money of England, to be recovered by Action of Debt, Bill, or
Plaint, to be commenced and preſented in the Name of the Chamberlain of the ſaid City of London for the time
being, in the King's Majeſty's Court to be holden in the Chamber of the Guild-Hall of the ſaid City, before
the Lord Mayor and Aldermen of the ſaid City, wherein no Eſſoign or Wager of Law ſhall be admitted or allowed
for the Defendant: And that the Chamberlain of the ſaid City for the time being, in all Suits to be proſecuted
by virtue of this preſent Act againſt any Offender, ſhall recover the Ordinary Coſts of Suit to be expended
in and about the proſecution of the ſame. And be it further Enacted, by the Authority aforeſaid, That
one Moiety of all Forfeitures to be recovered by virtue of this Act, (the Charges of Suit for recovery of them
being deducted and allowed) after the recovery and receipt thereof, ſhall be paid and delivered to the Chamberlain
of the ſaid City for the time being, to the Vſe of the Mayor, and Commonalty, and the Citizens of the
ſame City: And the other Moiety of the ſame Forfeitures (the Charges of Suit deducted as aforeſaid) to be
paid and delivered over to the Maſter and Wardens of the ſaid Company of Painter-Stainers for the time being,
to the Vſe of their ſaid Company, to the intent that the ſaid Maſter and Wardens of the ſaid Company for the
time being, may be the more careful to proſecute Suit againſt the Offenders in this behalf, in the Name of the
Chamberlain of this City for the time being.
