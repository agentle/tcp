doen by Maister Strangwige in Fraunce, and of his death.
            
               ENgland hath loſt a Soldiour of late
               Who Strangwige was to name:
               Although he was of meane eſtate
               His deedes deſerued fame.
            
            
               ¶For as the Plowman plowes ye groūd
               And toyleth to til for corne:
               So Strāgwige sought a deadly wound
               For Brittaine where he was borne.
            
            
               ¶In deede of birth he was borne bace
               Although of worſhipful kyn:
               In youth he ſought to runne the race
               Where he might prowes wyn.
            
            
               ¶In his yong yeares he walked wyde
               And wandred oft a ſtray:
               For why, blynd Cupid did him guyde
               To walke that wyldſome way.
            
            
               ¶Thus here & there I wot not where
               He ſounded where to ryde:
               But happy hauen he found no where
               Nor harbour for to abyde.
            
            
               ¶But when he had the courſe out run
               Where Pyrates prict the Carde:
               Twyſe at the leaſt, he thought vndone
               And looked for his rewarde.
            
            
               ¶For by legall lawes he was condemd
               Yet Mercy bare the mace
               And in reſpect he wold amend
               He found a Princes grace.
            
            
               ¶And in that ſtate he bowed to GOD
               
               And to his righteous Queene:
               He wold nomore deſerue ſuch rod
               Nor at Iuſtice barre be ſeene.
            
            
               ¶He thus contented for a whyle
               And laughed Fortune to ſcorne:
               Tyl weeds did worke by ſubtil guyle
               To ouergrow the corne.
            
            
               ¶And then occaſion ſerued iuſt
               That Martiall men must trudge:
               He vaunced himſelfe with valiaunt luſt
               To go he did not grudge.
            
            
               ¶And to the ſea he ſought a charge
               Where he might take his chaunce:
               And therewith ſpred his ſayles at large
               To ſeke a porte in Fraunce.
            
            
               ¶And paſſed by a warlyke towne
               Where municion lay a land
               He ſpoyld and cut their chaynes a down
               And paſſed by ſtrong hand.
            
            
               ¶Where as he caught a deadly wound
               Yet his courage neuer quayled:
               But as he had ben ſafe and ſound
               On his way forth he ſayled.
            
            
               ¶And paſſed through euen to that porte
               Where he vowed to aryue:
               And ſtyl he did his men coumfort
               And courage did them geue.
            
            
               ¶Then ATROPOS did him aſſayle
               That al Adams kynd doth call:
               Againſt whoſe force may none preuayle
               But ſubiect to him all.
            
            
               ¶This life (ꝙ he) which was me lent
               From iudgement ſeat in perrill:
               I came with heart for that entent
               To ſpend in my Queenes quarell.
            
            
               ¶Therfore this debt here wil I pay
               This life which is not mine:
               O Lord receyue my ſpirit to ioy
               That by Chriſtes death is thine.
