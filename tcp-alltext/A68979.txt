                     Demetrius the laſt of that name, after the death of his father Baſilius, ſucceeds him in the Empire, he diſtruſteth his owne people, and many of his Nobility, and ſtriues to ſtrengthen his eſtate by mariage with a yong Lady neere in bloud to Sigiſmond king of Poland.
                  
               
               
                  OF all the accidents that I haue read or heard of in the oppreſſion of any State or Kingnome whatſoeuer, either for the preſent or precedent ages, there hath none in my opinion béene found ſo ſudden, ſtrange and variable, with occurrants ſo doubtfull, and euents ſo fatall, both to Prince and People, to the inuader and the inuaded, with ſuch deuaſtation of Country, depopulation of Townes, combuſtion of Cities, ſuch deflowrings, rauiſhemnts, murthers, and horrible treaſons, fire, ſword, and famine, the tragicke executioners of theſe miſeries, plots and ſtratagems deuiſed in hell by diuels, and acted by men on earth: as hath happened of late yéeres, and is not yet concluded betwéene Sigiſmond nowe King of Poland, Charles King of Swethland, and Demetrius the laſt of that name, called the great Duke of Muſcouia, or Emperour of Ruſſia.
               
               And this vnhappie countrey, which before flouriſhed in great wealth, ſtate, pleaſure and peaceable commerce with ſtrangers, no warre at hand, nor none towards, but ſuch as no man looked for, was on the ſudden, before a mans

mind could thinke in ſuch a caſe of a kingdomes alteration, made the woefull Sceane and publicke ſtage whereon ſo many bloudy parts haue bene acted on all hands, as haue brought wretchedneſſe to the people liuing, and prepared miſery for the child vnborne: which warre well conſidered. God neuer gaue vnto the world a more memorable example, either in what vnſurety ſtands the ſtate of any Kingdome or Nation that is not propt and ſupported by the high hand of Heauen, or what miſeries and calamities ſuccéed in the progreſſe of ſuch bloudy and dangerous intendments, to a people ſo ſecure. And finally, what end followes ſuch treaſonable and deſpiteous crueltie, as the lamentable ſequell of this hiſtory ſhall declare.
               You ſhall therefore vnderſtand that Demetrius, the laſt of that name, Emperour of Ruſhia, after the death of his father Baſilius, called for his ſtearne and auſtere gouernement, as well by ſtrangers, as his owne naturall ſubiects, the great Tyrant of Ruſhia ſuccéeded him, both in the Empire and hatred of his ſubiects: For notwithſtanding that Demetrius was a moſt excellent Prince, framd euen in the prodigality of Nature, endued with many commendable parts, and hereyicke vertues, in the flower of all his youth and beauty, which commonly the people do much eſtéeme full of rich hope and expectation. Yet ſuch was the hatred they bare vnto his father, that not dying with his death, it liued ſtill in his iſſue, and proued in ſhort time the confuſion of this Prince, who (ſetting aſide his haughty diſpoſition) which ſéemed to be inherent in him by Nature, he was otherwiſe a moſt abſolute Prince, noble in mind, and of a kingly preſence.
               He hauing thus by his fathers death obtained, but not eſtabliſhed himſelfe in the Empire, deuiſed the beſt meanes he could for the aſſurance of his eſtate, which by reaſon of his ſubiects minds (being Alians to him) and many alſo of the Nobility (which for his fathers ſake alſo bare him no affection) ſtood very fickle: Amongſt which, there was at that time one Kneſeuanſuſce a noble man, and of great

power, that in the Raigne of the great Tyrant, being great Maiſter of the Horſe, did alſo at this time beare many great Offices in the Empire, which the preſent King Demetrius, more for feare then loue, ſuffered him to enioy. And that ſtate in a Prince muſt néedes bee vnaſſured, where the ſubiects power ſhall bréed the Princes feare.
               This Vanſuſce in the former Emperours raigne, did flily by his bounty and popularity wind himſelfe into the loue and opinion of the people: and becauſe that ſome fewe turbulent broyles and dangerous innouaſions were by his power and policy pacified, he was held in great eſtimation of the Prince, and great veneration of the Nobility, among which neuertheleſſe there were ſome that looking vppon his ſtate, with an enuious eye, did alſo with conſiderate eyes looke into his actions, that ſpringing from ambition more then from countries care or honorable ends, they found his greatneſſe to be dangerous, and thoſe acts which caried the name and colour of the Emperours good, ſerued vnder hand to make way for his ambition, as hauing only a reference to himſelfe and his owne deſignes, which Demetrius well perceiuing, did neuertheleſſe diſſemble, and coulourably made him faire countenance, as loth (in this gréene world) to ſtirre the fire that lay hid in this embers.
               This Vanſuſce was very noble in bloud, deriued from a long continued aunceſtry, honored in many ages with many alliances of the Empire, alwayes held in great loue and eſtimation of the people, he was in his owne perſon of a Princely preſence, full of affability & Court complement: yet neuertheleſſe ambitions, cruell, a great diſſembler, not letting to kiſſe whom he meant to kill, ſparing no mans death, whoſe life withſtood his purpoſe. He was heard once ſay to a ſecret friend of his, that that man was to be held vnworthy the ſtocke of all Nobleneſſe, that yéelded his honour to vaſſalage, whoſe fortunes might attaine to Soueraignty, whereby diſcouering his owne affections, he made himſelfe tranſparant, thinking that if his words were brought in queſtion, his power was able to defend

them. This Vanſuſces greatneſſe gane principall matter for the Emperours diſtruſt, knowing well that his ambition once ioyned with the peoples hate againſt him, whoſe natures are euer wout to follow Nobility, there might be raiſed a dangerous faction: for the preuention or méeting whereof, his friends councelled him to ſtrengthen his vnaſſured eſtate, by mariage in the alliance of ſome forreine Prince: for the furtherance whereof, there was a young Lady at that time of Princely birth and admirable beauty, as yet vncontracted in the Court of Poland. Thither with great preparations were Embaſſadors with great expedition ſent, the principall of whom was a young Nobleman, and kinſman to the Empereur, called Tragus, that bare chiefe place and honor, who being honorably entertained in Poland, found their diſſignes happely ſuccéede to their deſires: for in ſhort time this young Lady was withall ſolemnity affianced to this yong Prince, a great ioynture granted, a rich dowry conſtituted, and the Embaſſadour richly rewarded, withall ſpéed richly returned into Ruſhia.
               
               The Emperour embraceth the newes, and his kinſman for them kiſſeth the Ladies picture, confirmes the Articles, exhauſteth his treaſure, holds himſelfe poore in the riches of his hope, makes great preparations for his iourney into Poland, ſtill languiſhing in his deſire to ſée the ſubſtance of that beauty, whoſe ſhaddowe onely had ſo incenced his fancy, that that ſéemed to be true in him which was written by Plutarch, vpon the languiſhments of Marcus Anthonius, to Cleopatra Quéene of Egypt, that the ſoule of a Louer liues not in his owne, but in anothers bodie.
            
            
               
               CHAP. 2.
               
                  The Emperour Demetrius deſcends in perſon into Poland, with an honorable traine, and is there with all ſolemnity eſpouſed to the Poliſh Princeſſe, returneth into Ruſhia, bringing with him ſixe thouſand Poles for his guard.
               
               
                  ALL things being in ſumptuous manner prepared, the Emperour Demetrius ſetteth forward towards Poland, committing the gouernment of his Empire in his abſence to certaine of his Noblemen, whom he eſpecially truſted, conſtituting his Kinſman Tragus for his Vicegerent. The people ſtocke from all parts to ſée him, but neither with outward acclamations, nor inward deſires of ioy, which neuertheleſſe he little reſpected, ſuppoſing that this new alliance with Poland had ſo ſtrengthned his eſtate, as he ſhould not need to feare any inteſtine innouaſion, and from forreine inuaſions he was ſecured: howbeit there were ſome that iudging of future centingents by the preſent times condition, foreſaw that▪ this mariage and diſpoſings of it, might hereafter proue his confuſion, as indeed it did: Howbeit we will not now mingle his preſent pleaſures with vnſeaſonable feares of future troubles, but bring him in all honorable and delightfull manner out of his owne territories into the Kingdome of Poland, where in all places he found his entertainment to anſwer his eſtate, and to excéed his expectation.
               After many honorable ſtayes and méetings, with many Princes and Nobles of Poland, he came at laſt to Court, the King lying then at Craccow, the chiefe City in Craconia, and the principall Seate of the Kingdome, here he found all the honors that his heart could deſire, and ſawe the rareſt beauties that his eyes could behold: but that which moſt pleaſed him, was the ſight of her, whoſe beauty at firſt ſight did ſo rauiſh him with aſtoniſhment, that his eyes and other parts with outward complements,

were driuen to executs his tongues office, in diſcouering his inward thoughts: for he wanted words to expreſſe his Ioye.
               Here feaſting the time, and his owne deſires with banquets, imbracements, dances, and other amorous delights, at laſt, the long wiſht for day appeared, wherein the ſolemnity and authority of the Church, ſhould conſumate their hopefull longings with thoſe happy imbraſings, and that true touch of ioy that languiſhing Louers féele in the heigth of pleaſure, which then is at the full, when with ſimpathy of affection that ſwéete is mutually taſted betwéene them with reciprocall deſire, as it was betwixt theſe two Louers, in whom no compulſary conſent did enforce mariage: neither was there any incompacible bloud betwéene them to ouer-ſway or dull affection: for they were both of equall yéeres, and both of them the moſt perfect and abſolute frames of nature, that liued at that time in that part of the world. But at laſt, all things being finiſhed with the time for this Princely mariage, they begin to prepare for their departure, a new deſire therein ſtirring them both, him to reuiew his natiue Kingdome, and her to behold that land whereof ſhe was now ſtiled Empreſſe.
               The King and Quéene of Poland, a great part of the Nobility, and the richeſt beauties of the Court accompany them to the Frontiers of Ruſhia, the high-wayes, townes and villages being ſtrewed with flowers, and ſwéet ſmelling herbes, as if the ground had ſeemed too baſe to carry theſe Princely perſonages, the people flocking from all parts to ſée the blazing Comets of theſe two kingdomes, whoſe beauties attracted all mens eyes with wonder to behold them.
               At laſt, the day of parting came, wherein theſe two yong Louers hauing taken their leaues, with ſeuerall tokens of ioy and ſorrow, held on their way by their appointed Iournals, firſt to Smalenſco, the chiefe City in the Dukedome of Seueare, where the Emperours Kinſman Tragus in honorable manner met them, here ſtaying awhile

to reſt and ſolace themſelues, within few dayes they departed, holding on their conrſe, from thence to the great City of Moſco, where by the directions of the Prince Tragus they were with all State and Magnificence entertained.
               Here they liued a while in all delights and pleaſure. Who would haue thought that this Sunne thus ſhining but in his morning beauty, could ſo ſuddenly haue found an Eclipſe in this Horizon, euen in the high-way of his aſcending glory. But O the incertainty of terrene pleaſures, this light that brought ſo great a luſter to ſo great a Nation, was by the ſame people, whom it beheld with ſo faire an aſpect, ſuddenly extinct by the malignancie of Fate and oppoſite Enuy, as you ſhall further heare. The Emperour Demetrius brought with him out of Poland ſix thouſand Souldiers well appointed, to whom he gaue the guard of his perſon, diſtruſting the ūdelity of his owne ſubiects, which the rather did incenſe the Muſcouite againſt him, and in ſhort time proued the cauſe of his vtter ouerthrowe.

                  The Emperours guard of Poles abuſe his fauour, committing many outrages in the Citty, and in ſhort time fall into great hatred with the Muſcouite, Kneſeuanſuſce Iaying hold of this occaſion, ioynes with the Muſcouite, and growes diſcontent.
               
               
                  NOw while the Emperour with his Lady delighted in nothing but what might pleaſe his fancy, ſpending whole dayes and nights in Banqueting and Reuels, thinking all ſafe and ſecure, the Poles being a people proud in their owne nature, and that pride nowe doubled in them by the Princes fauour, commit without controlement many outrages in the Moſco, and other places adioyning,

ſo that by degrées (in ſhort time they came to be extreamely hated of the Muſcouite, which Vanſuſce perceiuing would oftentimes complaine ſo farre as he durſt to diuerſe of his friends the Muſcouites, both of the Indulgence of the Prince, and inſolency both of the Pole, alleaging probability of a Tyranny in the ſonne, more vnſufferable then that of his fathers.
               Who foreſées not ſaith Vanſuſce, that perceiues any thing, how this new Alliance with Poland is like to proue fatall to Ruſhia, who ſées not that theſe rude beginnings, are certaine ſignes foregoing much greater miſchiefes, if they be not in time preuented, we are ſcarſe now ſecured of our wiues, children and goods, but that many times they paſſe the hazard of their barbarous cruelty, if ſix thouſand Poles kéepes vs thus in awe, committing ſuch outrages (whereof there are daily complaints) without controulement, what will their greater numbers doe, whereof there is a continuall expectance: the Prince ſleepes and dallies in the delights of his new loue forgetting his old friends, his owne people are diſeſtéemed, the Pole hath all eſtimation, no Ruſhian ſues at Court but (if he will thriue) muſt haue a Pole to his Aduoacte, nothing that is by the Pole begged, but is by the Prince granted, without reſpect of common profit, the principall Offices begin already to be tranſpoſed both in Court and Citty, what ſhall we looke for but a declination ſtill from bad to worſe vntill we haue loſt all, and the Pole hath got all.
               Theſe words together with their outrages had ſo incenſed the Muſcouite that there wanted but occaſion to raiſe an innouation which vnluckely was ſoone after proffered, for a Poliſh Gentleman caſting by chance his eye vpon a Marchants daughter of Moſco, a virgine of excellent bewty, was ſo infangled in her loue, that hauing tried all waies for the obtayning his deſire by intreaties, and gifts, and finding ſtil his ſuite to returne in vaine, was neuertheleſſe ſo ardent in his outragious luſt, that hauing trayned her by

deuiſe into a place of conueniency, where in the purſuite of his deſire all faire waies being denied him, he in a moſt barbarouſe manner rauiſht her. This deflowred damſell with great ſorrow and heauineſſe complained to her frinds of this vile abuſe.
               When the cauſes of our griefes excéede all bounds, it workes in our minds diuerſity of effectes, not immoderatly thoſe that follow our ordinary afflictions, or the cuſtomary croſſes of fortune, which draw our ſighes, teares, and other common tokens of calamity; but in the exceſſe of grief when the obiect there of preſents a veiw beyond al patience or ſufferance, it ſo diſtracts the minde and aſtoniſheth the ſenſes that reaſon giuing way to ſorrow we fall into a boundleſſe Ocean of the extreameſt paſſtons, ſuch was the inuolued heart with griefe in that ſpectacle of all miſery Hecuba Quéene of Troy, who ſeeing herſelfe betraid

béene ſo long brought vp vnder your Lawes, Religion, and Gouernment, ſhould be ſo farre diſtruſted of our loyalties, and ſo much diſtaſted in our affections that you ſhould repoſe your ſelfe in a ſtrange guard, and expoſe vs to their cruelty. what outrages haue they committed ſince the comming of your Quéene into Moſco, ſparing neither age, ſex, nor quality, how many complaints haue béene made of their abuſes, but no redreſſe; and I the ſad father to this deflowred virgin perceiue by your lookes that I ſpeake in vaine, the way to oppreſſion is plaine and open, the path to Iuſtice is vntrodden, the King is a ſtranger to his ſubiects and a King to ſtrangers, the Muſcouite held himſelfe wretched vnder the gouernment of your father, but wee much more vnder your tyrannie, theſe laſt words did ſo incenſe the Prince, that with his foote he ſpurned the father of this damſell from him, and being by rage wholy tranſported from reaſon without any reſpect, either to the complainants cauſe, or the Muſcouites diſcontent, committed him as a mutiner together with his wife and this wronged damſell to priſon, who cauſing them there to be laden with Irons, did there by ſo ouerlade himſelfe with the hatred of his people, that in ſhort time it proued a burden too heauy for him to beare, ouer-preſſing him ſo much that it depriued him of his Empire, & in the end of his life, as the ſequell ſhall declare.

                      diſguiſed.
               
               
                  THe newes being ſpread abroad the great Citty, of the vſage of his Marchant, his wrongs and vniuſt impriſonment, together with his wife and daughter, the Muſcouite in more open manner bewray their diſcontents on to another, and all againſt the Pole, ſo farre forth that they begin to mutiny, flocking togther in great Companies with mindes of reſolution to reuenge themſelues for the wrongs receiued, which the Pole vnderſtanding, kéepe within the great Pallace, not daring to ſtirre abrdad: The Prince looking (but too late) into the danger, imploie certaine Noble men of his Court, ſuch whom he knew to be gracious with the people for the quieting of theſe tumults, by whoſe care and induſtry in ſhort time they ſéemed to be pacified, not appeaſed, the Marchant, his wife, and daughter deliuered, not contented, a puniſhment vpon the offender impoſed, not executed, a ſatisfaction promiſed, not performed, ſo that this fire was for a time ſmothered, not extinguiſhed, which ſhortly after brake forth in ſuch biolent manner, that the flame thereof had well néere conſumed the whole Empire.
               The Prince being much perplexed in minde with theſe garboiles and continuall dangers of innouation, demands councel of his friends what were beſt to doe, rather for preuention of miſchiefe then pacification of the people, the beſt counſell was giuen to appeaſe; to apply himſelfe to a gentle

and debonaire behauiour towards his ſubiects, that obedience was better from loue then feare, to ſend backe the Pole, into his Country, to betake the gard of his perſon to his owne people and to apply his gouernment to the nature of the Muſcouite. But the worſt, is followed which is to fore-ſtall to make his Guard ſtronger with the aide of the Poles to fortifie his Pallace and other places of command in the Moſco, to rule by force not loue, and vtterly to diſgrace and diſtruſt the Muſcouite, to this end, and for theſe purpoſes were there meſſengers ſecretly ſent into Poland for ten thouſand ſouldiers more to be entertained vnder his pay for the ſaueguard of his perſon.
               When diſtruſt once growes in a Princes minde and hatred once ſetled in the ſubiects hearts, they are hardly remoued, as was well found in this Prince and people, howbeit if at that time he had followed the beſt counſell to haue caſſiered the Pole and entertayned the Muſcouite for his Guard, vndoubtedly hée might long haue rained a happy Prince ouer a happy people, and preuented infinite miſchiefes that followed euen to ye vtter deſtruction of himſelfe and great deſolation in the Empire: And thus in the beginning ends the laſt act of his comike Sceane, and now begins the firſt act of his tragedy, and as the firſt was ſhort and full of pleaſure ſo this laſt was long and more full of miſery, for his old aduerſary Kneſeunnſuſce vnderſtanding of the cloſe diſpatch of the Emperours meſſengers into Poland for this new ſupply foreſéeing that the Prince would then be to ſtrong for him, except hee ſhould openly raiſe his powers, and ſo put it to the hazard of a battell, the end whereof he wiſt was doubtfull, as well for the number of the Poles that were knowen to be much better ſouldiers then the Muſcouite, as alſo for ſome few Noble men in Court both of land and power, whom he knew were faſt vnto the Prince, and might ſoone raiſe there forces: held it his beſt for the purſuing of his deſſignes to take the aduantage of ye occaſion preſent, & by a ſudden ſurpriſe with

the helpe of his friendes to make a new ſlaughter in the Pallace and places adioyning not only of the Poles but alſo of the Prince himſelfe his chiefe friendes and followers. To this end and bloudy purpoſe he ſendeth ſecretly to his friends & ſuch as he ſpecially truſted in the Citty to be in a readineſſe armed at an houre appointed, and as the Poet ſaith, Tenebris audacia creſcit: the night was held fitteſt for this déed of darkneſſe, & the Pallace it ſelf was made ye publike Theatre whereon was acted this horrible maſſacre, the night being come they flocke on all ſides to the houſe of Vanſuſce, all waies being fore-laide to preuent intelligence of this bloudy proiect, his friends and followers being thus aſſembled together to ye number of ten, or twelue thouſand, all armed for the purpoſe: Vanſuſce prepares for this bloudy aſſault, telling them with words of much incouragement that now ye long lookt for time was come, that ſhould make the Muſcouite famous to all poſterity in the deliuery of themſelues from the cruell tyrany of the Poles, the experiment of whoſe proud natures and bloudy diſpoſitions they were to wel acquainted with in their owne particulars, and that now the houre was come, wherein they might reuenge at full the vilde abuſes and intollerable wrongs of this vnſufferable ſtranger, and frée the Citty and the land of ſo dangerous a Viper, theſe words of Vanſuſce, together with ye credit and opinion that was held of him that ſpake them, did ſo ſtirre vp the ſpirit of the Muſcouite to the enterpriſe of this attempt, that moſt of them with an uniuerſall conſent of reuenge, the reſt carried with hate and deſire of ſpoile ran in diſordered troupes from the houſe of Vanſuſce to the Pallace of the Emperour which was two miles a ſunder, now was there one Glaſco a Secretary, and in ſpeciall truſt with ye Emperor, howbeit a moſt vile traitor, for being priuy to all Vanſuſces proiects he was ye only meanes for their entry into the Palace, this Glaſco ſhall carry the ſtampe of infamy, and for euer leaue it to his name and memory, who had he béene faithfull to his Lord and Maſter

might haue diſcouered this horrible treaſon, preuented the infinite miſchiefes that followed, preſerued the life of his Prince, and purchaſt to himſelfe immortal glory.
               The entry was made with little reſiſtance into the baſe Courts, where hauing once ſet foot, they cry out, liberty, liberty, liberty; kill, kill, kill; the Poles ſome naked, ſome weakly armed, according to the ſhortneſſe of the time, paſſe with ſmal defence the cruelty of the enemies ſwords, & it fel out as Vanſuſce had expected, for others that knew not the matter hearing the Larum-bell rung in the Pallace, came from all parts, and vnderſtanding that Vanſuſce was there in perſon, without inquiring further fell preſently to execution, killing all they found, as well Muſcouite as Pole, that bare office in the Court; now was there nothing heard in the Pallace but a horrible and confuſed noiſe of armour, Horſes, and harqubuſes; a pittifull crie of all ſorts of people, of all ages and conditions going vnto death, and the pitileſſe ſhoutes of murtherers, the Pallace died ouer with bloud, to the which (though hauing made choice of darknes) they neuertheleſſe ſet fire to giue them light for the execution of this maſſacre, two houres murder and rapine make this one night famous in the infamy of the executioners, to whom alſo afterwards it proued ſo fatall, as all of them were enforced to confeſſe that mans bloud ſplit violently, when as the manner therof, cannot lawfully challenge, the quallification of iuſtice is odious in his ſight; who hauing created man according to his owne image, ſels his bloud déerly to the authors of ſuch effuſion, neuertheleſſe this was but the exordium, or entrance, or firſt, or leaſt part of this Tragicke Sceane, for when their way was made into theinward Courts by fire and ſword, they ſpared none of any degrée or calling, euery obiect they ſaw in the Court was a ſubiect to their fury.
               The Emperour and his Lady being in the heart of the Pallace imbracing one another, in great dolour and heauineſſe determine yet nobly to die together, whileſt a truſty

ſeruant of the Emperors found away and meanes for their eſcape, the Prince in the habit of a ſlaue, the Lady in mans apparrel, thus in great ſorrow and feare theſe two younge louers in this diſguiſe tooke hand in hand, and with their faithfull guide by his direction paſt through by-waies out of the Pallace, then burning about their eares: he deſerueing for his care and duty to his Prince, no leſſe fame and memory then that patterne of all piety, Aeneas did carrying vpon his ſhoulders his old father, Anchiſes, euen through the flames of Troy.

                     Demetrius with his Empreſſe flies to the Dukedome of Collooge, and findes entertainment, Vanſuſce bruits him dead, and cauſeth one like him to be carried thorow the Citty murdered, the Muſcouite beleeues it.
               
               
                  THus theſe two yoong Princes ſprung from the lines of Kings, in the chiefe pride of their flowring youth, and beauty, in the height of all their ſtate and dignity, in the middeſt of al their pleaſures and delights, from the happy ſociety of their friendes and great Allies, are now by the vilde treachery of Vanſuſce, their ſworne ſubiect, and forſworne vaſſaile, brought from their Imperiall greatneſſe to ſo wretched and miſerable a ſtate, as not the meaneſt in the Empire would now willingly change fortunes and conditions with them.
               But to returne to their tragicke ſtory: They hauing by the aide of their truſty guid paſt the feares and dangers of the Pallace, tooke the Riuer of Volga, in a little boate, the Prince himſelfe helping his truſty ſeruant to row downe the ſtreame, O what a piteous ſight it was to behold a Prince that but the day before held a Septer of ſo rich royall

and ſpacious a kingdome ſerued in all ſtate and maieſty, attended on with Nobles, and infinite numbers of men, to be now tugging at a ſimple Oare, and labouring for his life to preſerue her, whom aboue his life, and all the world hée preferred, and of all that he inioyed but thrée houres before, to haue only this remnant left that he might call his owne, his deſolate Quéene, his faithfull ſeruant, and two ſilly Oares, and a little Boate.
               But holding on our courſe, we muſt publiſh to the world thoſe dolorous occurrents, and heauy calamities that followed, to fill vp this ſad Sceane of ſorrow with matter more tragicall then that of Seneca, in the wretchedneſſe of Locaſta, or that of Homer in the miſeries of Hecuba: thus this poore rich remaine of Ruſhia, theſe two pretious iewels pluckt rudly from their golden frame, theſe two great perſonages, in this little Boate, eaſing themſelues in this heauy burden of care by the naturall participation of ſorrow, and comforting themſelues in the ſight each of other, hold on their courſe towards the Dukedome of Colloga, ſome foureſcore verſe, as the Ruſhe cals it, from the great Citty of Moſco, which is about thréeſcore miles Engliſh, a place for the naturall ſcituation ſo defenſible, by reaſon of Riuers, Rockes, and Caſtles, that with an Army it is well neare vnacceſſible, Demettius hauing héere ſafely ſet his foote, the whole Dukedome did generally entertaine him, ſome alſo of the Nobility, and many of his old ſeeuants that had paſt the dangers of the Pallace, and the tiranny of Vanſuſce fled vnto him, in whoſe ſight hée comforted himſelfe with this, that he was not vtterly forſaken, thanking almighty God vpon his knées, that his ſtate thorough this treaſon was not reduced to ſo low an ebbe but that hée might yet liue, to out liue this miſery, and ſith hée was in this ſhort time raiſed from the attendance of one ſeruant and a little Boate, to the poſſeſſion of many ſeruants and a whole Dukedome, he might alſo afterward, by the reuolution of time, and fortune, recouer and repoſſeſſe his whole

Empire, checking his preſent feares with the hope of future contingents, ſtriuing thus to make a body of a limbe, and to beguile the actuall condition of his fortunes with imaginary conceits of better: But we will now leaue this croſſe ſtarre Prince in the ſorry comfort of his wan hopes, building new Caſtles in the aire, while his fatall enemy Vanſuſce poſſeſſeth his old Caſtles in the Empire, and letting him reſt a while after the vnreſt of that diſmall night, we will now returne where we left Vanſuſce burning, or ſpoyling that great Caſtle and Palace of Moſco, the royall Seate of many Emperours in many precedent ages, which had bene a building many yeares, and was thus miſerably in one night deſtroyed, or ſo much defaced, that to this day it is not re-edin̄ed: now muſt we bring vpon the ſtage Vſurpation attainders, forfeitures and confiſcation of Lands and Goods, plots, and ſtratagems to ſupplant, polices, and deuices to eſtabliſh a Crowne vniuſtly gotten, vpon an Vſurpers head, that is neuer at reſt, or ſeldome ſléepes in quiet.
               
                  Vanſuſce notwithſtanding that euery thing ſuccéeded according to his deſire: but that which was the maine of his proiect, the flaughter of the Prince Demetrius, whoſe eſcape none but his truſty friends knew of, procéeds in his purpoſes to make himſelfe Emperour, albeit he knew that he had no title thereunto, nor colour like to any.
               The mind of man is infinite in opinion and wéening, which being once ſet vpon ambition, nothing can ſtay or limit her aduentures, as appeared in Vanſuſce, in whoſe way lay two great ſtumbling blockes, the firſt was the eſcape of the Prince, the other was the life and greatneſſe of his Kinſman Tragus, who was alſo great in the peoples opinion him muſt Vanſuſce néedes remoue, or he finds a greater enemy expoſd then Demetrius that was expeld, this muſt be done ſecretly, and vpon the ſudden, and there was no time ſlackt, for thrée howers before the appearing of the day that followed this fatall night, a brother of Vanſuſces, whoſe name was alſo Demetrius, was ſent to ſurpriſe

him with fiue hundred horſe, he lying then at a houſe of pleaſure in the country, ſome fiftéene miles from the City, and to bring him priſoner to the Moſco, where by forme of tryall he was to paſſe ſuch cenſure as was preiudicated for him, in thoſe falſe crimes and imputations already ſet downe to be ſuggeſted and inforced againſt him: for he durſt not by reaſon of the peoples fauour procéed againſt his life, but by proceſſe of Law, and becauſe he knew alſo that it would be a hard matter to ſurpriſe him in his houſe, he cauſeth a letter of Credence to be counterfeit in the Emperours name, the tenor whereof was onely this, That there was ſome matter of import that craued his preſent aide at Court, and that he ſhould ſet all other buſineſſe aſide, and make what ſpéed he could thither, the truſt of this letter was committed to that vilde traytor Glaſco, as being found the fitteſt for this negotiation: howbeit there will come a time wherein he that is now an Agent, ſhall proue alſo a Patient in this bloudy tragedie, when that treaſonable bloud that now floweth in his veines, ſhall be let out euen by the hand of him whom he now obeyes, but we will leaue him now, and Vanſuſces brother Demetrius, to their poaſting iourney, and returne to the Caſtle at Moſco, where Vanſuſce hauing beheld many dead Carkaſes, found one that in yeares, fauour, and other lineaments of his body, was very like the Emperor, Vanſuſce layes hold vpon this occaſion, and hauing princely apparrelled this dead counterfeit, cauſed it to be publiſht, that the Emperour Demetrius was ſlaine: for manifeſtation where, he cauſeth this counterfeit to be laid vpon a Béere; and with great State to be caried bare-faced thorow the great Citty, to their State-houſe, or common hall, he accompanying the body in perſon, the people flocking from all parts to ſée him, beléeuing ſtedfaſtly that it was he, but no man beſtowing a ſigh or funerall teare vpon him, ſuch is the nature of the vulgar.

                  The counterfet body is buried for the Emperor Demetrius, with the ſtate and ſolemnity of a Prince, Tragus is ſuddenly ſurpriſed and brought priſoner to the Moſco.
                  
               
               
                  
                     VAnſuſce being come into the publike Hall, coulorably attired in blacke, being in himſelfe of a Princely perſonage and preſence, maieſtically aſcended vp into a high Throne that was ſuddenly erected for him, the ſuppoſed body of the Prince being laied before the people, where after ſilence proclaimed, he ſpake after this maner vnto them, with a ſad ſetled countenance and an audible voice. I cannot tell with what paſſions or affections of griefe and ſorrow, my deare Country-men, this dead Prince whom we lately called our ſoueraigne Lord and Emperour, lies buried in your hearts, but vnto me it is the ſaddeſt ſight, and the moſt wofull obiect that euer my vnhahpy eyes beheld, of whoſe bloud, as the immortall God can witneſſe of my cléere heart and innoſence, ſo I proteſt by the maieſty of him before whom I ſtand, that with your allowance and conſent, I would puniſh with torture, to all example, this worſe then Parricide, were it in the perſon of mine owne brother, though done in ignorance, as in ſuch vnhappy garboiles many ſuch chances happen: If probable witneſſe could be produced againſt him, for it is not fit the earth ſhould beare the murderer of his Prince, but becauſe that matters vncertaine cannot be certainly diſpoſed, we muſt leaue him to his iudgement that knowes as well the intenſions as actions of man, it onely reſteth that we performe our laſt duties to the dead, his funerall Rites and Obſequies, which I deſire may be with all ſolemnity accompliſhed, in whoſe ſudden and vntimely death, becauſe we haue loſt a hope of a continued line for ſucceſſion in the Empire, and that by the flaughter of the Poles we haue drawn

a great and dangerous enemy, it behooues you to make choiſe of ſuch a one to gouerne, whoſe wiſdome and valour may be able to maintaine the State and Maieſty of the Empire, and alſo méete with thoſe oppoſite occurrents that doth maligne it, but firſt of all, and chiefeſt of all, it behooues you to cut of all occaſions of ciuill and inteſtine war, for preuention whereof we haue this morning ſent for the Princes kinſman Tragus, as well to anſwer to ſuch ſupputations of crime as ſhall be obiected againſt him, as alſo in this dangerous time to be diſpoſed of by your wiſdomes, nought elſe at this time our dolorous tongue can diſcourſe of but the Princes funerals, which we wil haſten to ſolemniſe: and with that word he wipt his eyes, the people were ſo farre from any tokens of ſorrow, that they fell preſently to acclamations of ioy, clapping their hands and throwing vp their hats, crying Vanſuſce, Vanſuſce, God ſaue Vanſuſce.
               
               It is a thing worth the obſeruation to note and marke what diuerſity of ſhapes hypocriſie puts on, Haec ſimulata ſanctitas haec diſſimulata iniquitas, how many miles diſtant are the words and thoughts of a diſſembler, how many vnknowne Regions betwixt his tongue and heart, but admit they lie cloſe for a while they will be diſcouered when his iuſtice ſhall be turned outward, and though his treaſons haue for a time vndeſerued and vnſuſpected paſſage, as carring an outward gloſſe faire and remarkable, yet the day will come when hée ſhall render an account of his vniuſt Stewardſhip, and ſurrender vp and reſtore backe all thoſe falſe titles and honours which murder, periury, and horrible treaſon helpes him to put on, when by being truly pulled downe from the height of his falſe greatneſſe he ſhall be aduanced as a marke of terrour to all traitours and treaſons, in the meane time, and at all times his name and memory ſhall be held odious and infamous to God and all good men, to whom humane ſociety and vertue is had in veneration.
               
                  
Not long after the liuing Princes obſequies were with all ſtate and honour ſolemnized in the perſon of another, who though he were of baſe birth, and obſcure parentage, and perhaps did neuer any act memorable in his life, was neuertheleſſe in his death honoured with a Princes funerall, and buried in a Sepulchre of Emperours.
               But we muſt now returne where we left with Vanſuſces brother, Demetrius and the traitonr Glaſco, who many daies before this counterfet obſequies had betraied and ſurpriſed the young Prince Trahus, which in this manner was effected: early in the morning a little before the breaking of the day, they came within ſight of the Caſtle, where hauing found within a mile thereof a fit place by reaſon of certaine copſes of wood, and other ſhrubbiſh, to plant an Ambuſcado, Demetrius tooke the aduantage thereof, lying there cloſe with his men to intrap the Prince vpon the way whileſt this Achitophel, this Iudas, that had before betraied his Lord, in a moſt abhominable manner goes now alſo to betray his kiſman, to whom before hée had béene much obliged, but no benefite receiued, or pleaſure done can ſtay a treacherous heart bent to miſchiefe, for that it is altogether transferred vnto the end it aimes at, and neither reſpects the way it takes, nor the courſe it holds, though neuer ſo foule or indirect, he comes like ſlie Vliſſes, that ſtole Paladium out of Troy, with a faire face, but a foule minde, a ſmooth countenance, but a rotten heart; knockes at the Caſtle gate, and is let in, he vnderſtands that the Prince is a ſléepe, who God knowes little drempt of the fatall night his kinſman the Emperour endured, nor of this vnhappy day wherein hée himſelfe is to be betraied. Now becauſe that Glaſco had told the ſeruants of the houſe that his buſines was of ſuah import, that he had itin charge giuen not to forbeare his reſt, they waked the Prince before his houre, who vnderſtanding of Glaſcoes comming was very glad, and ſent for him into his bed-chamber, ſo cléere and true a minde hath innocence vpon the Anuile when treaſon and

miſchiefe is in the Forge. But this vilde traitour Glaſco being entered the Chamber, he in very humble maner ſalutes the Prince, and deliuers many ſuggeſted complements, together with theſe counterfeit letters from the Emperour, the Prince with a chéerefull and vnſuſpected countenance, giues him his hand, bids him welcome, demands of the Prince his health, and the newes at Court, all is deliuered in faire manner and coloured ouer with diſſembled words, the Prince beléeues all, and diſtruſteth nothing, receiues and reads the letter without ſuſpition, making himſelfe ready for his iourny to Moſco: Thus whileſt the tongue and the heart of truth are in one line paralel, the heart and tongue of treaſon are as farre ſundered as the Poales; ſuch diſtance there is from their artike words to the antartike purpoſes: the Prince is ſoone ready, kiſſeth his faire Lady, making more haſt then good ſpéed to goe on with this traitour to the Moſco; from whence he is neuer to returne, nor euer to behold his wife againe; ſhée wéepes at parting, as bedewing his hidden fate with her open teares, whether of preſent loue, or fore ſignifying ſorrow, they mount on horſe-backe, and with halfe a doozin of the Princes followers they poſt towards the Moſco, till they came within the compaſſe of the Ambuſcado, that all this while laie as ſtill as midnight, the larum being giuen on the ſudden, they ſurpriſe him and detaine him priſoner, there could be no reſiſtacne, the Prince ſeeing himſelfe thus vildly betraied, and by him alſo whom he eſpecially truſted, bouldly deſired to know the cauſe, and whether it was the Emperours pleaſure that he ſhould be thus held in captiuity, they anſwered him churliſhly, that he ſhould know the reſt at his comming to Moſco, and when he began in goodly tearmes, as he was an excellent wel ſpoken man, to bewray his innocenſe, they ſtaied not the end of his ſpeech, but rudely put him forward, at which the Prince ſighed, but it booted not: All this was done within view of the Princes houſe, and in the Ladies ſight: Now iudge all you houourable

dames, that loue your Lords and huſbands with intire affections, with what heart the ſad eyes of this deſolate Lady could behould this miſerable obiect, to ſée her huſband thus betraied within her view; ſuch was the ſorrow of that euer memorable Roman Lady Cornelia, wife to Pompey the great, when from a farre off ſhée ſaw her Lord and huſband in a little Boate betrayed and ſlaine, by the treacherous Councellers and bloudy miniſters of that periured Prince Ptolomie King of Aegypt, when after his ouerthrow in Theſſalie hée put himſelfe vpon his protection. And this poore Ladies ſorrowes were the greater becauſe ſhée neither knew the cauſe, their purpoſes, nor the meanes to helpe him, but wee muſt leaue her in her paſſions and follow him in his captiuity, whom they ſoone brought in a poaſting iourney to Moſco, and lodged him in a ſtrong priſon.

                     Tragus is arraighned, condemned, and iudged vniuſtly in the Moſco, who out of the greatneſſe of his minde, to mocke

                  NOw were their daily counſels and conſultations held in the Citty, concerning the progreſſe of this buſineſſe with this Noble-man, by Vanſuſce and thoſe of his ſecrets: who

                     •
                  e grew to be powerfull by: reaſon of his ſtrong Guards and plurality of friends, that from all parts flocked vnto him. The day was ſoone appointed for this young Lords tryall, not from his knowen innocence to cléere him, but from their preiudicated doombes to confound him; the publike place of iudgement was appointed, the Theatre vpon which muſt be acted this Gentlemans tragedy, thither at the day ſet downe comes Vanſuſce in a Princes Roabe, together with his friends, allies, and a ſtrong guard of ſouldiers, the principal Officers in the Citty accompanying him, and hauing all

taken their places, this Princly priſoner is brought in before them who with a chéerefull and vnaffrighted countenance beholds them all. The allegations of treaſon obiected againſt him were, that by his procurement the laſt warre with the Tartars was commenced that coſt more treaſure and bloud then the victory was worth, that by his ſollicitation that vnhappy marriage with the Poliſh Princes was mediated and concluded, that the Poliſh Guard was by his meanes brought in, by which, ſo many outrages were committed that they were driuen to take the courſe they did for their ſlaughter, in which the Emperor himſelfe paſt an vnhappy deſtiny, the guilt of whoſe death was laid vpon him as being the originall, though not the efficient cauſe thereof, that the bringing in of tenthouſand Poles more was by his counſell vrged, that the Princes treaſure was by his prodigal profuſe of mony much waſted, that he had allowed the title of the Dukedome of Seuere, to the Crowne and Kingdome of Poland, with other matters not ſo much as thought vpon, to all which, the Prince anſwered ſo fully and ſo nobly as euery vnpartiall eare found his innocence; howbeit truth neuer told her tale but enuy was either ready to wrong herby ſuggeſtion, or falſhood by ſubornation, for vniuſt witneſſes were produced againſt him, by whoſe teſtimony this innocent Prince was condemned. Vanſuſce then riſing from his Throne, began with a ſtudied and premeditated ſpéech after this maner, I cannot tell my louing Country-men in what tearmes, or with what words I ſhall procéed in iudgement againſt this Noble-man, late kinſman and néere Alley vnto our deare Soueraigne Lord the Emperour, for when I thinke of the times paſt and compare them with the preſent, the thought and conſideration thereofſo ſtrikes me with aſtoniſhment, my minde being diuerſly diſtracted betwixt my Countries care and this Noble-mans reſpect, that I ſtand deuided in my iudgment, the one pleading rigor, the other pitty, what I ſhall definatiuly ſet downe in cenſure for him or againſt him;

firſt giue him his due, who doth not ſorrow that ſo noble a Gentleman, ſo fully ſtuft with ſuch excellent parts of mind, of ſo admirable compoſure, and conſtitution of body in the prime of his youth, and beauty in the pride of his ſtate and pleaſures, in the ſolace and comfort of his wife and children, his ouer-héedleſſe actions, and ouer-wéening conceit, his owne greatneſſe, in abuſing the Princes fauour, ſhould now make him vnworthy of his life, by reaſon of the ſtates preſent condition: whereas otherwiſe his life ſhould haue bene moſt deſired. For mine owne part, I would I had not liued at all, or at leaſt, not till this time, wherein ſauing my countries care, and the entire reſpect and affection I beare to all your liues and ſafeties, I am otherwiſe euen againſt the conſent of my ſoule, and my beſt genious, enforſt to pronounce peremptory ſentence of iudgement againſt ſuch a man, to whom but of late I gaue place to in honour.
               For thus ſay my priuate thoughts to my common cares, where Nobility, greatneſſe, a Princes fauour, or what excellent parts or qualities ſoeuer, either of body or mind, be in the ſame ſubiect that owes them tranſferred vnto it ſelfe without reſpect of common good, to the which he owes a duty, he growes not onely an vnprofitable, but alſo a dangerous member to that Common-wealth, and where from ſuch a mind there be acts committed, though but criminall, and feares depending of greater conſequence in this caſe, it is more then a politicke or nationall Lawe, it is Religious Iuſtice, and the ſeruice of our God, to take away the life of ſuch greatneſſe, and make it the peoples ſacrifice: and therefore with your conſents, ſince things cannot otherwiſe ſtand, or be eſtabliſhed, I giue him ouer to the rigour of the Law, and the miniſters thereof.
               All this while this captiue Prince although he ſaw how cloſely and indirectly euery thing was carried, and had heard during the time of his impriſonment, the ſuppoſed death of the Emperour, the murther of the Poles, and many of great place and office in the Palace, actions ſo bloudy

and ſo fatall that albeit be knew the world to be full of miſchiefe, and the pathes thereof troden with vnſanctifyed féet, yet he thought there wanted that venemous matter in the minde of man to beget, bréed, and bring forth ſuch hideous and horred murders, he doth yet neuertheleſſe, neither in the conceit of theſe inhumane maſſacers paſt, nor in the iudurance of his owne vnauoidable miſeries preſent ſhew tokens of any feare or affrightment, but with the ſame countenance he held before in his proſperous eſtate, he now beheld the tiranous authors, and bloody actors of his tragedy, ſo nobly had the inward vertues of his minde framed and compoſed the outward actions and geſtures of his body: And thus with words as bould, and as vndanted as his lookes, he ſpake in this manner vnto them.
               I haue ſtrained withall my beſt within me, to heare and beare patiently all your vnkind handlings, vniuſt preſumtions, furious Inforcements; your malicious and manifold appliments, foule wreſtings, and impoſſible conſtructions, and all to make me ſéeme to be a member dangerous to the ſtate, to take away my life as a common enemy, which onely muſt be remoued to make ſmooth the way to your preſent ends and intendments, for this cauſe was the true noble bloud of my royall Lord and kinſman ſhed, to make you grow vp in this falſe greatneſſe, I ſpeake to the Vanſuſce, whoſe inward ſaule knowes my innocence in all my accuſations, and that al this ſhew of Law is but a form, a méere ingine, or deuice to ſet a gloſſe vpon your horred murders paſt; and to take away my life by a pretext of iuſtice, which you perſue in mallice, haue I ſhowne my ſelfe dangerous to my Country, when in the laſt wars with the Tartars I ſo little regarded mine owne life, that I ſpent moſt of her bloud in that action, and returned victorious againſt the eie and opinion of all that ſaw and knew the danger of that day; did I wrong my Country when with your conſents and allowances I made that honourable contract with the Poliſh Princes; was that the Treaſure I exhauſted in that expedition: when mine owne priuate Coffers

are yet empty with that charge. For the Poliſh guard, it was rather my enforced conſent, then my voluntary counſell, or approuement, for the title of the Dukedome, with the reſt of the Articles, which I ſcorne to repeate, the great God of my hope knowes me to be as frée either in action, or intention, as he knowes the Vanſuſce to be guilty of theſe horrid treaſons; I doe not plead mine innocence to ſaue my life, for that is foredoomed by an vnchanged decrée, but only to eaſe my heart of an ouerburdening wait of griefe which your baſe wrongs, and falſe wouen iniuries haue contracted there, (and it, is one comfort yet that I am ſuffered to ſpeake, I doe not raile either againſt thy tyranny, or the maleuolence of my ſtarres, there is no man greater then his deſtiny, neither haue I ſet the gard of vertue ſo weakly within me, againſt the ſpight of Fortune, or your malice, but that my ſpirit and reſolution can ſuffer, either in thy inhumaine cruelty Vanſuſce, or thy vnnatural treachery vild Glaſco, or all your hates you vnkind Muſcouites, or what elſe is precious vnto mée, as the loſſe of wife and children, depriuation of lands and honours, or torment, or death, or whatſoeuer can happen in humanity: All theſe or what elſe is in the power of enuy, hate, malice, or tiranouſe oppreſſion is beneath me. Life is not my Paramour, I ſtand not inamourad of her pleaſures, the world hath to me adulterated his faire proteſtations of loue and reſpect, with the foule proſtetucions of the times miſchiefe, I haue ſéene an end of my fortunes, and haue ſet an end to all my deſires, all the ambition that is left in mée is the hopefull enioyment of a far more glorious kingdome, thether doth my ſoule aſpire, and thither ſhall my ſpirit mount before your time prefixt, if there be any therefore in this aſſembly that either is at this time, or ſhall happen héereafter to rome into the like danger, and would know how to mocke Vanſuſces tyranny, let him learne it thus by my example: And with that word hauing cloſly drawne a ſhort dagger hid of purpoſe for this houre, he ſtabbed himſelfe to the heart, an a
                     •
                   though in it ſelfe ſéeming deſperate and full of horror, yet in

circumſtance and conſiderate reſpects truly noble and ful of honour that would not ſuffer his oppoſite and mortall enemeies to triumph ouer his vertues and the freedome of his ſpirit in his end.
               The ſudden and voluntary death of this Noble man put them all into amaſement, and ſome there were preſent and thoſe not of the meaner ſort, did for the time ſo inwardly ſorrow for the hard diſaſter of the Prince his innocence and iniuries that they made outward manifeſtation thereof by there teares, which Vanſuſce perceiuing, and in their generall ſilence a generall ſadneſſe, that from thence his Plots and Proiects, might be more narrowly looked into with conſiderate eies, began to looke about and to gather his wits together to draw this inward créeping ſuſpition from the heart of the Muſcocite, vpon whoſe loue and opinion did principally depend the hope and meanes of his procéedings, hée therefore ſpake againe vnto them ſo fully for the times condition, ſo colourable againſt the guilty life, and raſh death of the Prince, and ſo carefully for the ſecurity of the ſtate, together with all their ſafties, that hée ſoone turned the gentle currant of their paſſionate ſorrowes into the vaſt Ocean of their wonted rage, crying out againſt the houſe of Demetrius his name and family, and in this new humour, like the flattering Iewes to Herod after his Oration to the people, they falſly guild his words with an Angels eloquence, crying out after their wonted manner, Vanſuſce, God ſaue Vanſuſce, ſuch a turning Phane is the peoples breath, with theſe much looked for acclamations the Court was preſently diſſolued, the dead body of the Prince carried backe to Priſon, from whence the next day, it was brought forth againe and poorely buried, making the world to ſtand at amaſement, that the earth which neuer failes of meanes in aboundance for a Princes life ſhould now faile in neceſſaries for his interre-ment.

                  The wife of Tragus dies for ſorrow his two children are detayned priſoners, 
                        Ʋanſuſce is crowned Emperour of Ruſhia, Demetrius, with the Empreſſe flees into Poland from whence with a great Army he returnes backe into Ruſhia: the warre begins.
               
               
                  AFter this tall Ceader of the Ruſhian ſtate was, from the mountaine of his greatneſſe, thus pulled downe: many lower trées and ſhrubbes paſt the like fortune, for whoſoeuer ſtoode in Vanſuſces way muſt be remooued, till it was made ſmooth from any oblique let for his tranſcending glory, euen to the maieſtike ſtate of the Ruſhian Empire, treacherous Glaſco being the principall agent, and ſpeciall inſtrument for his deſignes, and Intendments.
               But before we ſet the Crowne on this vſurpers head, whileſt the preparations be now in framing for his Coronation, wée will looke a little backe into the wretched ſtate, and miſerable condition of this vntimely Widdowed Lady, wife to the late noble Prince Tragus, and his two ſonnes, both ſo young that they were not capable of their calamity: To write of this Ladies teares, and hir profound ſorrowes, were but like a Painter to counterfeit by art the teares of Lucreſſe for her enfroſt wrong done to Collatyne, or the true bred woes of Porcia for her déere Lord Brutus, to ſhew outwardly the preſentation of ſuch tragike ſpectacles, and ſo to féede the phantaſie with imaginary griefe, in which neuertſteleſſe their is neither life, nor ſenſe of reall ſorrow.
               To leaue therfore theſe teares with her that was the true owner of them, who preſently alſo leauing the world and

the pleaſures thereof encloſed hirſelfe in a religious houſe, where with long faſting, and déepe melancholy, ſpending her daies alone in the exerciſe of ſorrow, in ſhort time ſhe ended her life, leauing behind her a notable example of loue and conſtancy: his two ſonnes are yet liuing, but detained as priſoners by Vanſuſce, howbeit happily reſerued to better fortunes.
               Now is Vanſuſce arriued at that Hauen he a long time did bend his courſe vnto, euen through a Sea of bloud, where neuertheleſſe he ſhall not finde that ſafty that he expects, for dangerous is the State that is obtained by bloud and treaſon, as the ſequell ſhall declare, the Emperiall Crowne of Ruſhia being now ſet vpon his head, there fell miſchiefes thicke, and as the thing euill gotten is ſeldome, or neuer well kept, thorow all the time of his vſurped raigne there neuer ceaſed bloudy war and ſlaughter, no not in his owne deſtruction and captiuity for he had ſcarſe time to finiſh the ſtate and ſolemnity of his Coronation, before he heard newes of the great preparations in Poland, both to reueng the treaſonable wrongs done to the Emperour, and alſo the murder of the Poles, or rather which is moſt like, Sigiſmond the King of Poland making theſe but colourable pretenſes for higher deſſignes of another nature, both to recouer the Dukedome of Seueare, to the which hée challenged a title, and further, as the ſucceſſe ſhould follow to inuade the whole Empire of Ruſhia, and to kéepe it for himſelfe, to make another entry that way into the Kingdome of Swethland, ſuch a paſſage had this ciuill diſcention made, euen for the ouerthrow of the whole ſtate, but wée muſt now returne to the lawfull Emperour Demetrius, who being by the happy fortune of his birth a Prince, was now by the malignant power of his fate a fugitiue, for hauing about ſome few of his friends that followed him in all fortunes, hée gaue them in charge to looke carefully to the kéeping of that Dukedome, it being ſtill a receptacle for them in the worſt of danger while he with his vnhappy Lady in great danger and ſtrange diſguiſe together with his

truſty ſeruant paſt from Colloge, and after a long and weary iourny at laſt tooke the Riuer of Ipre, and with ſafty recouered the Territories of the Poliſh Kingdome.
               
                  Sigiſmond hauing notice of their comming, ſendeth his ſafe conduct, together with directions for their entertainment, but not in the ſtate and ſumptuous manner as before, for in a change of fortune we finde a change of friendſhip and account, being neuertheleſſe come to Court, they were honorably welcomed, and comforted after their many endured miſeries, where they reſted themſelues awhile till the preparations for Ruſhia were made ready, it being an Army of fourty thouſand ſouldiers. With this new raiſed power, Demetrius raiſeth new hopes, both to recouer and to reuenge, which fell not out according to his deſire, man purpoſeth but God diſpoſeth.
               Now Vanſuſce hearing of this great preparation in Poland, fortifies the Citty of Moſco, and other places of import, gathering ſouldiers from all parts to ſtrengthen his faction, bearing the Muſcouite in hand that it was the police of the Poliſh King to haue entertained ſome ſtragling runnagate to take vpon him the name and ſtate of Demetrius, only to countenance this inuaſion; ſtaying by this ſuggeſtion the vncertaine minde of the Muſcouite, that otherwiſe he knew would be diuerſly carried. But Demetrius being now in all things furniſhed for the trantpoſing of this great Army into Ruſhia, takes his leaue of the King and Quéene and other of his friends in Poland, but aboue all, of his deare beloued Empreſſe, whom his vnhappy eies ſhall neuer behold againe; to ſhew her ſorrow in his departure, were to ſtay vs in the purſuite of this great war that muſt be proſecuted with all ſpéed and cruelty, Demetrius thereforewith many long marches, at laſt had paſt the frontires of the Poliſh Kingdom, he no ſooner had ſet footing vpon the Territories of his owne Empire but the miſeries of the war began, and that Country that before flouriſhed with along countinued peace, and was growne excéeding rich both in their owne abundance, and a proſperous commerce

with others, began now to be ſpoiled and harried of hir plenty; fire and ſword being the executiones: the Pole ſpoiled and killed in all places in reuenge of the Maſſacre done in the Moſco, ſparing neither ſort, nor ſex, in any ſtate or age, whom they met withall, neuertheleſſe the moſt of them had before fled into Citties, Caſtles, Woods and other defenſible places.
               Thus miſchiefe hauing ſet footing in Ruſhia, it did in a ſhort time take ſuch rooting, that in a long time after ſhée was not ſupplanted, Demetrius either giuing conſent therto, or elſe wanting power in himſelfe to curbe her, howbeit he made as much ſpéede as he could to Moſco, either to make the ſpoile of his Country leſſe by his haſty marches, or otherwiſe burning in deſire to be reuenged on that place where he had receiued ſuch wrong and outrage. Being at laſt come to Moſco, he beleagers the Citty, but findes an vnexpected reſiſtance, it being ſo ſtrengthened with men and munition that it was wel-néere vnpregnable, all plaof ſtrength and import about the Citty were in ſhort time ſubdewed and giuen to the Pole, who executes all manner of cruelty: Demetrius laies wait in all places to cut off all ſuccour that ſhould be brought into the Citty, ſo that the Muſcouite in ſhort time endured great want and miſery, to wright all the particulars of this ſiege, that continued for the ſpace of two yéers, would aſke a whole volume by it ſelfe; I will onely touch the moſt ſpeciall occurrants, according to my beſt intelligence that happened in that time.
               
                  Vanſuſce vnderſtanding the miſeries that the Country people indured by the cruelty of the Poles, and fearing all great miſeries in the Citty, if the fiege endured, ſent ſpéedily and ſecretly his Curſitours to Charles King of Sweathland, whom hée knew to be mortall enemy to Sigiſmond King of Poland, demanding vpon certaine condicions his aid to remoue the Leagure. King Charles hauing at that time an Army of French, Engliſh, and Scottiſh, in pay for any occaſion offered from Sigiſmond, but vnderſtanding at

that time all his preparations were diſpoſed of in Ruſhia, and knowing alſo that it the Pole ſet footing their hée ſhould find him more dangerous there then in his owne Country, yéelds eaſily to Vanſuſces demand, imploying the forces of thoſe ſtrangers which he had ſtrengthened with many companies of Swethens, to the full number of twelue thouſand vnder the conduct and generall command of one Pontus de la Guard, a French Captaine, a man of more fame then worth among them.

                     Sr. Robert Sherly comes as Embaſſadour from the Perſian to Demetrius in the Leager, the Muſcouite mutiny, but are appeaſed, Glaſco is ſuſpected, conuicted, arraigned, and executed in the Moſco.
                  
               
               
                  
                     KNeſevanſuſee albeit he bare no great affection to King Charles, and was loth alſo that ſo many ſtrangers ſhould bée brought into Ruſhia, to harry and ſpoyle the Country, yet knowing the difference that was betwixt him and Sigiſmond King of Poland, he held it his beſt to make vſe therof, to ſerue his owne turne in their diſſention, and by any meanes rather to remooue the pole, then vpon the beſt conditions to yéelde vnto their habitation there, making choice rather of a ſufferable than an intollerable ſtranger. Now while theſe forces were thus a raiſing in Swethland for theſe deſignes in Ruſſia, Demetrius with his Army lying ſtill before the City of Moſco, that braue Spirit of England, Sir Robert Sherley, came as Embaſſador to Demetrius from the Sophie of Perſia, demanding his aide in the generall hoſtility to be made by chriſtian princes againſt the common enemy the Turke, where hee found that entertainement that thoſe tumultuous

times in warrelike leager could afford, but for the matter of his Embaſſie, the preſent troubles cut off the meanes of any preſent aid, ſo that after his ſtay there ſome few daies, hauing receiued many honourable giftes and preſents hée departed, onely furniſhed with hopes and faire promiſes, howbeit his comming thither put the Muſcouite into more then a preſumption, that it was the true Demetrius that beleagerd their Citty, and that the report of his death was but a fained matter, inſomuch that in moſt places, eſpecially in the Moſco, they beganne to murmure, whiſpering one to an other, that God had forſaken the guidance of them and their Citty, and had giuen them ouer into the hands of ſtrangers and others for their diſloyalty, they ſaide betwéene themſelues, that it could not be that the King of Poland, other Princes, and many noble men of Ruſſia in the leager could be ſo long deceiued with a counterfet Emperour, but either his countenance, behauiour, ſpéech or ſom ones report or other would betray him. They compared the times preſent with the times paſt, and found that the Errours and Indiſcretions of a yong Prince, being their naturall Lord, were more eaſie to endure than the milder gouernement of an Vſurper, for that the abuſe and inſtabilitie of his eſtate had drawne infinite daungers and miſeries by a contrary faction, which they now endured in no meane degrée, and were like héereafter to ſuffer in the greateſt extreames theſe murmurings and priuie whiſperings being brought to Vanſuſces eare, he beganne to looke about, and to preuent all occaſions that might be offered for the raiſing of a faction within the Citty, hée therefore ſought to pacifie the Muſcouites in the beſt manner he could, and withall ſent colourably (vnder ſafe conduct) certaine Gentlemen his friends to the Emperour in the Leager, that if he were the right Demetrius his true and lawfull Prince, he ſhould ſhew it in a naturall loue and care vnto his Countrey, and not ſuffer him to be thus defiled with the bloud of his people, by the Poles crueltie,

and for his owne part, if he found that it were ſo, he would not onely ſurrender vp vnto him, the Title and gouernement that he now held, together with the Citty and other places in his command, but alſo in all ſubmiſſion acknowledge and ſerue him in all faithfulneſſe and duety as his naturall liege Lord, hée further inſtructed them to excuſe him in the plottes and courſes that hée had taken, and to blame but reſpectiuely his ſufferance in the abuſes of the Poles, that had drawne on the hatred and indignation of the Muſcouite, ſo farre as being gathered to a head, and breaking forth into action, it prooued as a raging Torrent or violent Inundation that no wayes could be ſtopped: hée willed them further to deſcend into particularities, and to touch the ſeuerall factions on his part, that it ſtoode him vpon to take the aduantage of his friends offers, and the opportunity of euery reuolt, to the end that the head of all, which was himſelfe, might be the ſurer garded, and this (hée ſaid) hée learned of Nature and Neceſſitie, that teacheth euery creature to defend herſelfe, and that albeit he could a long time endure the ſiege, and that hée knew alſo the Forces were ready in Swethland to attempt the Leager, he would yet neuertheleſſe giue ouer theſe new hopes and deſignes for warre, and with all his beſt, endeuour to conclude a peace, proteſting with this concluſion, that if by his maieſties fauor hée might enioy thoſe lands, honors, and offices, to the which partly he was borne, partly he enioyed by the deceaſed Emperours gift, and his owne admiſſion, no Prince in the world ſhould finde a more loyall ſubiect or more faithfull Gentleman than himſelfe. Demetrius albeit he ſuſpected a Padde in this ſtraw, did neuertheleſſe either ſimply or colourably put them in hope of a Parlée, and for a time held a ceſſation, diſcharging the Meſſengers with faire words and countenance, who at their returne into the Citty, gaue out that this was not the true Demetrius, but a counterfet by Vanſuſces inſtructions, and that if they held out but a few dayes till the comming of the

                  Swethen Army, the Leager would eaſily be remooued.
               
                  Vanſuſce alſo beſtirres himſelfe to ſtirre vp the Muſcouite to endure the ſiege vntil the comming of King Charles his forces: In the meane time Demetrius had vnderſtanding ſecretly of ſome cauſes of diſcontent giuen from Vanſuſce to the traytour Glaſco, both in the barres to his expected recompence, and alſo in the change of Vanſuſces fauour and countenance, for it is commonly ſo with Vſurpers, when their turnes are ſerued by ſuch Miniſters, whohauing made all the vſe of them they can, they conuert their ſeruices done, into iniuries, eſpecially where there is an expectation of rewarde aboue merit, for benefites with tyrants are of no longer pleaſure, than they can with eaſe reſtore them, that once tranſcended, they ſtudy not how to reward, but to kill: for Glaſco ſuppoſed that his ſeruices to Vanſuſce were of ſuch woorth and greatnes, that halfe the Empire had béene ſcarſe his recompence. Demetrius therefore ſtriuing to worke vppon this his diſcantent, and that by him ſome meanes might be wrought for the ſurpriſe of the Citty, ſent ſecretly his Lecters vnto Glaſco, wherein after hee had touched (but in gentle termes) his diſloyalty, he willed him to conſider that there was no way for him to recouer the loue and opinion both of God and man, but to vntreade againe thoſe ſteppings of treaſon, which from a corrupt minde his guiltie féete had before trodden, promiſing him in the word of a Prince, that if hée would find meanes for him to enter the Citty, hée would not onely pardon what was paſt, but reſtore him againe into his wonted place and fauour. Theſe Letters being intercepted, were brought to Vanſuſce, who preſently cauſed this traytour to be committed to priſon, where hauing a long time endured much miſerie, hée was at laſt arraigned and condemned, and finally, were he faulty, were hée faultleſſe hée was executed in the Moſco, a fit death for ſuch a life. There were many others of his confederacie, which becauſe I knew not their names,

I would not mention their actions, but this I deliuer from report, that none of them all died their naturall death, onely one excepted, that yet liues in a pelting Village in Ruſcia, poore, wretched, miſerable and hated of all the world.
            
            
               CHAP. 10.
               
                  King Charles of Swethland ſendeth an army of twelue thouſand Souldiers into Ruſcia, vnder the command of Pontus de la Gard a French Coronell, the Ruſcians ioyne with them and remooue the Leager: the Emperour Demetrius flees againe into the Dukedome of Colloge.
                  
               
               
                  NOw muſt the miſeries of Ruſcia be augmented by the comming of this Armie compounded of ſo many Nations, Engliſh, French, and Scots. For though they came as a friend, and for their aide, yet who can ſtay an Armie from ſpoile and rapine, which the vnhappy Ruſcian found true in the purſuite of this bloudy warre, not onely in their goodes and cattelles, but euen in their wiues and daughters, which in all places were made a proſtituted prey to the luſtfull appetite of the Souldiers. It was about the beginning of Summer, that this Army of King Charles deſcended into Ruſcia, vnder the commaund o
                     •
                   the aforenamed French Coronell Pontus de la Gard, who with all ſpéede marched with this Armie to the Cittie of Moſco, encamping in the moſt commodious place they could find neare to the Poliſh Leager. Demetrius was before aduiſed to remooue, by them who fore-iudged the proofe of that which the ſequel manifeſted, foreſéeing that it would be a hard matter for Demetrius to reſiſt both the Forces of the Moſco, and this new raiſed power, for being much wearied with a long ſiege, being now alſo with this freſh

Armie, in a manner beleagerd themſelues, they ſeene found the want of victualles and other neceſſaries, which in a ſhort time brought them to great miſerie, and to increaſe the Swethen Army, Demetrius the brother of Vanſuſce aduaunceth himſelfe forward with twentie thouſand Ruſsians, to ioyne with the Swethen forces. Now are all places ſoreſtalled that might bring in ſuccours to the Poliſh Leager. The Emperour Demetrius was now in greater miſerie than euer before: for beſides the wants which he endured, the Poales themſelues beganne to murmure and muteny againſt him, inſomuch as he was often times enforced to heare many contumelious words and reproaches pronounced againſt him, that he was an vnhappie Prince, borne to a diſaſtrous fortune, and not onelie for himſelfe, but alſo for ſuch as ſhould take part with him.
               The Councells that were daily held were continually diuided, ſome aduiſe to make their way thorow the Swethen Armie, others to continue the Leager, the moſt to parlée, the laſt was the worſt that Demetrius liked, knowing well that there would be no compoſition made without his deliuery, either aliue or dead into the hands of Vanſuſce, which though the Poales knew it was for their beſt ſafety ſo to do, yet they did abhorre it as an execrable déed, to betray a Prince whom they had vndertaken to protect, and to yéelde him to his enemies hands whom they had vowed to defend. To continue the Leager, was without all poſſibilitie of effecting, victualles growing ſo ſcarce in the Campe, that all prouiſion was deuoured ſo farre as they were enforced to eate their horſes; and from this ſcarcitie followed a great mortallitie. The Poale being ſo ſtraitly ingirt, that they wanted ground to bury the dead, the vnhappy Prince ſits alone in his tent, all deſolate and diſmayed, wanting both courage and councell in theſe extreames; in the Campe he fées his dignitie decreaſed, and his commaund not reſpected; in his Tent he feares murder, in his Cuppe poyſon: and though the cauſes of theſe

feares were falſe, there being no ſuch in tendments, yet to a troubled minde ouerwhelmed with ſorrow, oppreſſed with care, diſtracted with opinion what comfort or conceit can aſſure, his friends being a few noble men of Ruſsia that were about him, comfort him and councell him, that he would aduenture with thoſe companies of Ruſsians hée had yet in his commaund, which were faithfull to him in all fortunes, being neuertheleſſe not aboue the number of a thouſand men, make an attempt in the dead of the night for their eſcape, euen through the Swethen Armie, the neceſſitie of the time and place ſay they vrge you to this dangerous reſolution or to die, there being no third way for you to take: you ſhall not néede to feare our loyalties, becauſe our owne liues lies in the ſame hazard, and if wée line or die, it ſhall be our glories, that we haue either frée
                  
                     •
                  d you from this danger, or that we haue communicated our ſeruice to the fortunes of our Prince. For the attempt it ſelfe, it may happily not prooue ſo full of perill as it appeares to be, for that the darkeneſſe of the night, the ſuddenneſſe of the action, and the aduantage of the place, wherein we are quarterd, being but againſt the ſkirtes of the Swethen Armie, may happily make our way with more ſafety, and leſſe loſſe than you imagine, howſoeuer it falles out, the greateſt danger dwells héere, where to remaine, there is nothing more certaine than certaine deſtruction. Theſe words, together with the deſperate condition of their eſtates, made him ſuddenly to apprehend the plot, and to entertaine with courage the reſolution of this attempt, which was done ſo cloſely and ſo ſecretly, as it was not diſcouered till the larum was giuen: this was about the noone of the day, all the after noone was ſpent in councell, and in giuing directions, which alſo was done ſo couertly, as the Poales themſelues doubted nothing leſſe than that which was intended. Now is the houre come wherein Demetrius muſt paſſe as great or a greater danger (by all opinion) than that of the Caſtle in Moſco,
                  
but with leſſe feare or ſorrow: for his vnhappy fortunes had now ſo inured him to ſuch diſaſtrous accidents, that his mind ſéemed to be ſuted to his miſerie, all things therefore being ready, they beginne to diſlodge, the larum was firſt giuen in the Swethen Armie, and was ſo ſuddenly anſwered in all places, that it bred a horrible confuſion, the Poales feared a ſurprize from the Swethen Army, the Swethen from the Poales. When they came into the Emperours Tent, not finding either his Guard or himſelfe, they cried out, that he had betrayed them. Pontus de la Gard drawes the beſt of his Foxes to the head of his Campe, and there attends all attempts, whileſt the Emperor with the loſſe of a few men had paſſed the danger, the darkenes of the night being a great help vnto him, his guides before day had brought him out of all feare from any followers, howbeit many of the Poales followed after, and yéelded themſelues afterward to him in Colloge.
               
               All this time both the Campes ſtoode ſtill without anie attempt on either ſide. The Citty alſo not knewing the matter were ſoone in Armes, howbeit kept themſelues within the walles, in the morning the Poales found the plot, and being driuen euery way to obey neceſſitie, they required Capitulations of truce with Vanſuſce, which was granted, the Articles drawne, the compoſition made, the Poles diſlodgd, and with colours diſplayd, they went, ſome into other parts of Ruſsia, turning Coſſakes, and liuing vpon ſpoyle, ſome backe into Poland, who hauing related to their King the manner of Demetrius flight, and by it their owne enforcements, he renounced for euer his friendſhip and alliance, proteſting from thence foorth neuer to aide him either with men or money. But though hée ſéemed to be diſcontent, hée was neuertheleſſe inwardly glad that ſuch occaſion was proffered, in his owne behalfe to reuenge and recouer the loſſe hée had ſuſtained, and vnder this colour, together with the broken Title hée had to the Dukedome of Seuean, to inuade the whole Empire of

                  Ruſsia, and to kéepe it for himſelfe, which ſhortly after hée in perſon did, as you ſhall heare. And thus was the Poliſh Leager all this time remooued.

                  Kneſeuanſuſce continues ſtill his vſurped authoritie. Sigiſmond King of Poland deſcends into Ruſsia with an army of a hundred thouſand men: he beſeegeth Smalenſco, and the great Citty of Moſco. The Emperour Demetrius makes another attempt, but is driuen backe into the Dukedome of Collogue.
                  
               
               
                  NOw ſtoode Vanſuſce higher in ſtate and opinion of the people than euer before: Now were there daily feaſtings and triumphs in the Citty, and all dedicated to Vanſuſces fortunes, Orations made daily in the publique Hall to the people of eternall praiſe and immortall thankes to Vanſuſces greatneſſe, euen aboue the ſtraine of ſlatterie, attributing the ſafetie and preſeruation of their liues and goodes to his wiſedome and prouidence, together with the generall good of the whole Land, reduced by him from a manifeſt danger of vtter deſtruction, the benefit of whoſe peace (ſay they) and happy ſtate next vnder God, wée deriue from his Imperiall Maieſtie in his naturall and politique body, the one ſo abſolute in bloud and qualitie, the other ſo excellent in State and Councell, that as he giues place to no Prince liuing for Stile and Territorie, reaching from the Riuer of Ipre, to the Caſpian Sea, in Fame and Glorie they all giue place to him; and it is the vniuerſall Ioy of the whole Empire, that to a Prince voluptuous and full of defects, as was Demetrius, there hath ſuccéeded a Prince of ſuch high worth and eſtimation. They alſo

gaue great praiſes and giftes to the French, Engliſh and Scottiſh for their paines taken, and valours ſhewne, in their defence, ſtill retayning them in the Moſco for their garriſon. But though the Citty was for a time thus deliuered, and in quiet, the Poles that remained ſtill in the Countrey, hauing taken many Caſtles, and ſtrengthened themſelues in many places, commit all manner of vnſpeakeable cruelty and villany on the poore people, who can call nothing they haue their owne, neither wiues, children, nor goodes, but are all made a proſtituted prey to the Poles luſt and rapine; in their houſes, ſword and fire deſtroyeth them, in the woods, hunger and colde deuouceth them. Thus the poore Ruſsians in many parts of the countrey doe miſerably foele or endure, eyther aliue or dead, the bondage of the Poles tyranny. Yet theſe afflictions and calamities preſent, are but as a ſufferable paine or diſeaſe, inflicting one part or limbe, in reſpect of the vniuerſall miſchiefe following, that tormented and almoſt deſtroyed the whole bodie of the Empire. For by this time Sigiſmond King of Poland raiſeth a mighty Army, compounded of many Nations, as Tartars, Leiflanders, Coerlanders, together with ſome Companies of Engliſh, Scottiſh and Dutch, and many numbers of Coſſakes, which bée people drawne from all partes, following onely for ſpoyle and prey.
               
                  Vanſuſce hearing of theſe great preparations in Poland, fortifies the Moſco and other places of import in the Empire, but eſpecially the Citty of Smalenſco, whereof one KneIacob a Noble man of great power and vertue, was Duke and Gouernour, howbeit at that time, for ſome reaſons, he committed the gouernement and defence of that Citty to an other whoſe name I could not learne. Thus all things being in a readineſſe, both with the Pole for inuaſion, and the Ruſsian for reſiſtance, Sigiſmond aduaunceth forward with his Army, conſiſting of a hundred thouſand fighting men. This was about Michael,

maſſe in the yeare 1609. for he ſtayed of purpoſe till their Harueſt was ended for the reliefe of his Armie. Being deſcended into Ruſsia, he came with his whole forces before the Citty of Smalenſco, one Chollcoſce a noble ſouldier that had done many honourable ſeruices againſt the Turke, being his Lieutenant generall.
               Now had Vanſuſce (which I ſhould haue remembred before) ſent to King Charles of Swethland for more ayde, who preſently diſpatched his Meſſengers to France, England, and the lowe Countries for men. There were taken vp in England of Voluntaries, Engliſh, and Scottiſh, two thouſand vnder the commaund of Captaine Caluine a Scottiſhman, lieutenant Coronel to my Lord of Wormſton, and of Captaine Coborne a valiant Souldier Coronell of the horſe. There were alſo ſent at that time out of France, and the low Countries, to the number of one thouſand more, the French vnder the commaund of Monſleur la Vile a Captaine of name and worth among them, the Dutch vnder the commaund of Coronell Doue: the Engliſh and Scottiſh Forces arriued in Swethland about the latter end of Maie, ſome in the Nulies, ſome at Stockholland, and ſome in other places, as the vncertaintie of winde and weather draue them. But being all at length met at Stockhollam, entertained, muſtered, and ſworne vnto King Charles, our Forces, together with the French and Dutch, which by this time were all mette, ſtayed there the moſt part of the Summer, vntill the latter end of Auguſt, in which time the King had made his preparations ready for his Intendments towardes Ruſsia. About the beginning of September theſe Forces tooke ſhipping for Ruſsia, but by contrary windes were driuen vpon Fynland, where becauſe the Commaunders had no directions to land their men, the froſt ouertaking them, and victualls failing aboorde, our people vnaccuſtomed to ſo colde a climate, dyed in great numbers, for want of foode, and abundance of colde, inſomuch that being not able to

indure the extremitie, they landed their Forces by directions from the Gouernour of Abo, a towne ſcituate vppon the Sea: from thence to march to the Cittie of Wyborrough, being diſtant from the place of landing thrée ſcore and tenne leagues, in which march they loſt by the extremity of the colde, many of their men by the way, and many were left behinde ſicke, that neuertheleſſe did afterward recouer the Army. At the laſt being come to the Cittie of Wyborrough in Fynnland, our Troupes reléeued themſelues after this long weary march, and being kindly entertained of the Bourgers, kept their Chriſtmaſſe in the citie, and reſted there for the ſpace of fouretéene dayes, wanting no neceſſaries that their preſent caſe required. After this time expired, our Troupes marched thrée daies iourney to the Sea ſide, that Sea being narrow in that place, parting Fynland and Ruſsia: héere they marched eight leagues vppon the Ice, and hauing once ſet footing in Ruſsia, the people of the Countrey being vnacquainted of their comming, forſooke their houſes, fléeing into the woods and other vnknowne places, for the miſerie of the warre was ſo great by the outrages of the Souldiers, that they found cauſe to diſtruſt all, aſwel thoſe that came to defend them, as ſuch as came to deſtroy them. Yet our troupes committed no other ſpoile in their march, but onely in their prouiſion for victualls, which in all places they found in aboundance, our Troupes marched in ſmall iourne is the foure moneths following, Ianuarie, Februarie, March and Aprill, vnder the guide and conduct of one Burriſſe a Noble man of the Countrey, appoynted by Vanſuſce for that buſineſſe; in which march they fréeed thoſe partes of the Countrey, which the Pole before was poſſeſſed of, as the firſt, a towne of import called Stallaruſſe, which the Pole forſooke vppon their comming, and fled. But Monſieur la Vile following them with a few horſe, cut them in péeces. They marched from thence to a Towne of defence called Coſtaſco, which the Pole had

a little before beleagerd, but vpon an aſſault made, hauing found an vnexpected reſiſtance. And hearing the approach of the ſtrangers, they fled before our comming.
               By this time the Sunne in his delight ſome progreſſe hauing paſſed the Equinoctiall, had turned the wearie wrackes of waſtefull winter, into the cheerefull view of the Summers beauty, at which time, it being in the beginning of Maie, our Troupes recouerd a very pleaſant country, where in great plenty they found all neceſſaries for horſe and man. After ſome few dayes march in this champian countrey our Troupes receiued intelligence where the Enemy lay, to the number of ſeauen or eight thouſand, at a Towne called Arioua ſome foure ſcore verts, which is thrée ſcore Engliſh miles from them. This Arioua was a great Towne, ſcituate on the ſide of a hill, pleaſant to looke vppon, the great riuer of Vollga running through it, and as it were, equally parting it in the middeſt, with a ſtrong and faire Caſtle in it; howbeit the Towne vnwalled and vndefenſible.
               Our men hauing receiued true relation, both concerning the Towne, the Poles ſtrength, the diſtance, and the beſt way that leadeth vnto it, they entered into councell, what beſt was to be done for the ſurprize of this Towne, and a non ſlaught of the Poles, and as alwayes in ſuch caſes of weight, there are diuerſitie of Iudgements and Opinions, ſome giuing councell one way, ſome another, the braueſt ſpirites ſtirred vp with honourable emulation of others fame and greatnes, preſſe forward for employment. Coronell Coborne being the firſt that deſired to haue the vndertaking of this buſineſſe with fiue hundred horſe; but his plot being diſliked, as being too full of danger, Monſieur la Vile the French Coronell vndertooke with foure hundred horſe to doe ſome notable ſeruice or other, as occaſion ſhould be proffered. For many times in ſuch doubtfull caſes, vnlooked for Accidents and vnplotted attempts finde better opportunitie and ſucceſſe in preuayling vppon

the ſudden, than premeditated and fore-decréed Councells. Thus hauing taken ſome of euery Troupe, Engliſh, Scottiſh, and French, with the aide of thrée other Captaines, as Captaine Coſmorre, a Moore, a very valiant Souldier, brought vp in the warres of the Netherlands, the other Captaine Crale an Engliſhman, and Captaine Creton a Scottiſhman, with this number of foure hundred horſe. La Vile earely in the morning leauing the Armie in their quarters, marched towards Arioua, by the way they mette with a Conſkippe of the Enemy, being a hundred horſe vppon the ſkirt of a wood, if beeing ſent from the maine Armie in Arioua as a ſcowt-watch to diſcouer our Troupes, for they had Intelligence before of our being in the Countrey. Their Vancurriers hauing eſpied our forces, gaue the larum, and preſently turned backe and fled, but our Troupe followed, flew ſome, forced others to take the riuer of Vollga, tooke many priſoners, the reſt fled, fyring the Countrey as they went, and brought the newes of our approach to Arioua. La Vile with his troups held on his courſe, méeting with no other Occurrents by the way till hée came to a little riuer, which they found ſo déepe, and the current running ſo ſwift by reaſon of the late diſſoluing of the Snowe, that they knew not how to paſſe ouer. La Vile himſelfe proffered to giue the attempt, but was ſtayed by others that looked into the daunger: a French Souldier of his Troupe, ſhewing more courage than foreſight, tooke the riuer with his horſe, and by the violence of the Streame, were both drowned. Here they ſpent ſome time to ſéeke out a foord, but found none: at laſt they eſpied a narrow place, where (pulling downe an olde houſe ſtanding hard by) with the rafters thereof they made a little bridge, vppon which they paſſed on foote, ſwimming ouer with their horſes in their hands. Thus they marched forward till they came within ſight of Arioua about the noone time of the day. La Vile when he came within view of the Towne, and ſaw how it ſtoode parted

by the riuer of Vollga, might perceiue afarre off on the other ſide of the Towne, the Enemies colours diſplayed in great numbers, the ſodaineneſſe of the action bred a terrour on both partes, the Poales verily beléeuing that the maine Armie of our Forces to be at hand, and our troups ſuppoſing the Enemies ſtrength to be as great on that ſide the riuer as on the other, though vndeſcried, howbeit they kept on their march towards the Towne, with reſolution to doe ſome notable ſeruice, eyther by death or victorie: when they came within halfe a league of the Towne, they eſpied fiue hundred horſes of the Enemie aduanced againſt them, where on the ſodaine both ſides awhile ſtood in gaze one of an other: at laſt fourty of the Enemies horſes were drawne foorth, with proffer of a charge after the manner of a Brauada, a twelue or ſixetéene of our horſes gaue an onſet to anſwer them, ſlew ſome, and beat the reſt backe into their maine ſtrength, ſo that both partes againe ſtood in gaze one of an other. Some doubted that it was the policie of the Pole to draw our Forces néerer to the Towne, and ſo to encompaſſe them with their Armie on the other ſide of the riuer.
               But La Vile, whoſe courage ouercame all feare, ſéeing no third way to be taken, but eyther that night to die, or to be Maiſters of the Towne, out of a braue and honourable minde, with a few words in Dutch, did after this maner encourage his Souldiers, Wée haue come (ſaith he) thus farre (my louing friends and followers) with purpoſe and reſolution to doe ſome ſpeciall ſeruice or other, in the honour of our Countries, and profeſſion, for aduauncing the ſucceſſe of the maine action for this Land againſt the Poles tyranny in the behalfe of the King of Swethen. This place of Commaund which at this time I enioy with your conſents, I will ſtriue with all my power to diſcharge, as well for your ſafeties and contentments, as mine owne honour and reputation, and though we be of ſeuerall Nations, Languages, and Cuſtomes, we are in

this buſineſſe tyed together in an indiſſoluble band of loue and partnerſhip, eyther to liue or die together, the beſt hope is, wée haue one God to defend vs all, whoſe outſtretched arme ouer-ſwayeth all: let not then eyther our owne weakeneſſe, or our Enemies ſtrength affright vs, for beſides the atchiuements of Honour that pricketh forward euerie worthy minde, there is a neceſſitie to put vs forward, for backe we cannot goe, without certaine diſhonour and deſtruction, all places being harried and ſpoiled by the Pole, and no reliefe to be found: the riuers alſo and the champian fields will giue them aduantage with their numbers to heamme vs in, and cut vs in péeces: and if I be not deceiued, they ſtand in more doubt of vs, than we of them, as I iudge by the vncertaine wauing of their colours on the other ſide the riuer, and it may be all their feare hath giuen them falſe Intelligence, that wée are to receiue ſeconds from our maine Armie, which they ſuppoſe to be at hand. From this feare of theirs ſpringeth my hope, that in ſpight of the Poales Armie wée ſhall reſt in yonder Towne this night, and with that, crying out with a high voyce and ſpirite, Iheſus met ounce, which in Engliſh is, Ieſus be with vs, with a braue courage they aduanced forward. Captayne Coſmorre with the Engliſhmen gaue the charge, and was ſeconded by the French men.
               The Pole ſéeing the charge thus made with ſuch reſolution, fearing (as it was afterward knowne) the approach of our maine Armie, turned their backes, and fled. Notwithſtanding they had a ſecond of foure hundred horſes more, our troupes followed with all ſpéede, ſlew many with the ſword, the moſt of them tooke the riuer of Vollga, thinking to recouer their maine Army, but the greateſt numbers of them were drowned. Our troupes thus entred the towne of Arioua without any other reſiſtance, and found the caſtle abandoned, at which they maruelled, that a Towne and Caſtle of ſuch ſtrength and import, hauing eight thouſand men to defend it, ſhould be thus forſaken.

                     Vanſuſce ſends his forces to ioyne with the ſtrangers, to the number of thirty thouſand. Pontus de la Gard Generall of the ſtrangers, attempts to rayſe the Poles Leager from Smalenſco, but in a ſet battell is fought withall and ouerthrowne by the Pole.
                  
               
               
                  
                     ARioua being thus taken in, our Troups reſted there thrée dayes till our maine Armie came vp, in which time the Pole ſtayed in the Towne on the other ſide the riuer. But when they ſaw the approach of all our forces, they haſtned their departure, and becauſe they ſuppoſed the Inhabitants had betrayed them, they ſet fire on that ſide of the Towne in the dead of the night, onely to reuenge ſuſpition, where after a moſt cruell and barbarous maner, they burned and ſlew, man, woman, and child; a lamentable ſight it was, to beholde the flame, and to heare the confuſed cries of the people, which was the more miſerable, becauſe, as there was no pittie in the Pole to reſpect them, ſo there was no way in our Troups to reléeue them, by reaſon of the riuer, which for want of boats they could not paſſe. The Poles hauing thus ſatiſfied their rage vpon the poore Ruſſian with blood & fire like incarnate diuells, without remorce, leauing this miſerable people of all ſortes and ſexes, from the impotencie of Age, to the innocence of Infants, burning in that earths hell of horror, they marched away with drummes beating, trumpets ſounding, colours diſplaying, as if they had effected ſome notable atchieuement. Early in the morning, La Vile perceiuing them marching away, hauing had the night before many boats brought vp the riuer by the Ruſſe, carried his principall Forces ouer, and with all ſpéede followed them. The firſt night they ouertooke them in their quarters, ſlew many of them, tooke many of their

colours, and forced the reſt to flée, who ſtill burning and ſpoyling the Country as they went, left no reliefe to helpe our Forces in the purſuite, ſo that in thrée dayes, hauing cléered all that part of the Countrey, they returned to Arioua, where our Armie reſted ſome fouretéene dayes: and as contraries are euer beſt knowne by their contraries, they ſound the excellencie of reſt after their labour, and of plenty after their wants. For héere they found all things in aboundance that in many places before they wanted.
               Not long after La Vile with Coſmer the Moore, and lieutenant Conisby a very reſolute Souldier, tooke in a Towne called Pogrilla, together with a ſtrong Skonce manned by the Pole, taking it vpon a ſur prize in the night putting them all to the ſword onely the Gouerneur, and ſome few other reſerued, La Vile, within a while after, went to the Moſco, accompanied with many Officers, Engliſh, Scottiſh, and French, where Vanſcuſce entertained them with liberall gifts and rewards to euery one. Héere they met with Pontus de la Gard, and found a great power of the Ruſſians in a readineſſe for ſeruice. Sigiſmond lying all this while before Smalenſco, vnderſtanding of the frée paſſages, that the ſtrangers had made thorow the Countrey euen to the Moſco. And hauing receiued further Intelligence, that their Forces were ready to ioyne with reſolution to attempt to raiſe the Leager from before Smalenſco, ſent vppon the ſodaine Chollcoſce his lieutenant generall with fiftéene thouſand Launſiers, and thirtie thouſand Coſſakes to take a Skance of great import called Gregory, that lieth in the common paſſage betwéen two great woods from Moſco to Smalenſco. This Skonce being thus ſtrongly beleagered on all ſides, Vanſuſce raiſeth his Armie from the Moſco, conſtituting his brother Demetrius their Generall, who ioyning with the ſtrangers Forces, of whom Pontus la Gard had the commaund, they march towards the Skonce of Gregory, the whole Armie conſiſting of fortie thouſand. Being come within two daies

march of the Skonce, the Enemy hauing gotten intelligence by ſome of our fugitiues, of the approach of this Armie, their numbers and purpoſes, which was to ſurprize them in the night vppon a nonſlaught. Cholcoſce to preuent their proiect the night before, drawes out of his Leager thrée thouſand and fiue hundred Launſiers, being Noble men and Gentle men of the beſt rancke and reſolution, that came with the King out of Poland, together with ſeuen thouſand Coſſakes, and with this number, hauing nine thouſand Launſiers more for a ſecond, cloſely in the night they marched; and earely in the morning, which was Midſummer day, they fell ſodainely vpon our quarters. Our men truſting that the Muſcouite, who knew the Countrey, would by the Scowt-watches haue giuen the larum of any ſodaine approach. But the Ruſſe not daring to ſtirre out of their quarters, was the cauſe of our vnhappy defeature, and their owne vtter ouerthrow, for our men being thus put into amazement by the larum giuen. Pontus de la Gard did according to the ſhortneſſe of the time, and the weight of the danger) diſpoſe in this manner of his Forces, the vangard he gaue to Edward Horne a full Souldier and a braue Commaunder with his Regiment of Fynlanders, who were the firſt that ſtoode the Poles charge. But being ouercharged by the Poles number of Launſters, they fled, ſcarſe abiding the charge. Coronell Coborne commaunding the Engliſh horſe, aduaunced forward with his Troupes, to anſwer the Pole. The French and Dutch did the like. But Cholcoſce finding them weakely armd and horſed, being alſo encouraged before with the ouerthrow of the Fynlanders, with corage and reſolution followed the tract of his fortune; and in ſhort time ouerthrew the whole Forces of the ſtrangers horſe, but with the death of many of his owne Launſiers, The whole Army of the Ruſſe ſéeing the fortune of our forces, being themſelues out of danger, fled, without ſtroke ſtriking. The companies of our foote, ſéeing the ſucceſſe

of the day, did barrocad
                     •
                   themſelues with Cartes and Waggons, with reſolution to fight it out to the laſt man, or to take ſome honorable compoſition. Which Cholcoſce perceiuing, and doubting ſome further ſtratagem, his returne alſo backe to the Skonce of Gregory being of moment, ſatiſfying himſelfe at that time with the glorie of this day, made a tender of theſe proffers following, that if they would giue ouer their ſtrength, they ſhould be at libertie, eyther to ſerue the Emperour, or the King of Pole with the ſame pay they had: if they would returne to the King of Swethland; they ſhould haue leaue, if into theyr owne Countries, they ſhould haue licence, and helpe to paſſe through the Poles Country, with the Kings fauour. Theſe proffers were accepted, and they hauing yéelded, did ſeuerally diſpoſe of themſelues, ſome backe to the Emperour, ſome to the King of Swethen, the moſt of them to the Pole, many home into their Countries. Thus was this great Armie vnhappily diſperced, that neuer met together againe. Pontus de la Gard, Edward Horne, La Vile, Collayne, and Coborne, with a few Officers, and ſome Souldiers, to the number of fiue hundred, returned backe to the King of Swethen.

                  The Emperor Demetrius returnes from Colloge with a hundred thouſand men and beleagers Moſco on the one ſide of the towne, Cholcoſce on the other. Vanſuſce is taken priſoner, and ſent into Poland. Demetrius flees againe to Colloge, and is at laſt miſerably ſlayne by a Tartare.
                  
               
               
                  
                     VAnſuſce hearing of the ouerthrow of his Army, was much troubled in his minde, eſpecially for the defeature of the ſtrangers, vpon whom he principally truſted: he now ſaw, that the hand of God was againſt him in dangers ineuitable, which

by humane reaſon and iudgement, he could not auoyde, he feared Demetrius on the one ſide, that had drawne together in Colloge a hundred thouſand men, with purpoſe to beſiege the Moſco on the other ſide. He knew the Poales forces before Smalenſco, and that they were ſtill re-informed with new ſupplies: hée feared Gregory could not hold out that Skonce, bearing his name which Cholcoſce had beleagerd, but that he would yéelde it vp vppon any compoſition, as indéede he did. He knew then that there was no barre nor hawlt for the Poales Armie to march from Smalenſco, to the City of Moſco. To the increaſe of theſe feares hée ſawe the citty empty of victualles, and other prouiſion for the warres. But that which moſt troubled him, he found his reputation much leſſened in the opinion of the Muſcouite. While Vanſuſce ſtoode thus exerciſed and perplexed with theſe feares, ſayling betwixt Scilla and Charibdis, in doubt which way to take the Emperour Demetrius, layes hold of the occaſion, and once more attempts with this new raiſed power to recouer his Empire, hée therefore with all ſpéed aduanceth forward with this great Army, conſiſting of a hundred thouſand men, that in thoſe tumultuous times, either for his loue, or their owne ſafeties had fled vnto him, there were alſo ten thouſand Poles in his Army that had followed him in his laſt flight from the Moſco. He hauing thus once more like an Emperour the commaunding of ſuch an Armie, which neuertheleſſe was more fearefull for their numbers then in their armes and courage, came before the Citty, fortifying his camp, and planting his Ordonance, which ſoone beganne to batter. Sigiſmond King of Poland hauing intelligence hereof takes his aduantage in this diuiſion and ſends Cholcoſce his lieutenant generall, hauing lately taken in the fort of Gregory with forty thouſand men to beleager the other ſide of Moſco, there were alſo fiftéene hundred ſtrangers in his army, Engliſh, Scottiſh, and French, that had put

themſelues into the King of Poles ſeruice after their defeature on Midſummerday. Now was this great citty inuironed on all ſides, with huge numbers of men of warre, and in ſhort time brought to ſo great miſery in the height of all extreame, that if a man could imagine in ſuch a caſe the worſt of calamity, ſuch was the wretched fortune of this citty, wherein nothing but horror and deſpaire was found, the canon roring without, women & children crying within, the noiſe of drums, trumpets, horſes, harqnebuſes, and the helpleſſe grones of dying men, made it on earth a hell to the miſerable Muſcouite. Famine alſo at length ſo pincht them that they found theſe miſchiefes to be vnſufferable. Now was Vanſuſce without heart or hope, fearing daily to bée betrayed by his owne friends, if we may call it treaſon, to betray a traitor, and his feares prooued true, for many noble men that were about him, looking into the preſent times condition, and reducing to their mindes the nature of the times paſt, they found Vanſuſce to be both the originall and efficient cauſe of all theſe miſeries, and that God had thus plagued them with the plagues of men, for ſuffering an vſurper to raigne ouer them, ſo that at laſt vpon aduice taken, they tooke Vanſuſce priſoner ſitting in councell among them, with ſuppoſe, by deliuering him captiue, to make their peace with Cholcoſce, O had the vnkinde and vnſtable Muſcouite deliuered this vſurper vnto their lawfull Emperour Demetrius that lay on the other ſide the citie, and had brought him in with their ſubmiſſion and acknowledgement of alegeance, they might haue had the hand of God to haue fought for them, and haply in ſhort time recouered their former peace and glorie. But they doubting his weakeneſſe, and fearing the ſtrength of the Poles, deliuered vp their priſoner, together with the Citty into the power of Cholcoſce, to be kept for the king of Pole. Which in this maner was effected.
               It was agréed vpon betwéene Cholcoſce and the State

of Ruſſia, that he ſhould haue deliuered into his hands, the Citty and the Caſtle to be held with a garriſon for Sigiſmond King of Poland, vnto whom they proffered acknowledgement of homage and fraltie, conditionally, that Cholcoſce with his Armie ſhould preſently remooue the Leager of the Emperour Demetrius on the other ſide the riuer. Theſe proffers were accepted of Cholcoſce, together with the condition, conditionally that they ſhould deliuer ſufficient hoſtages into his hands ſor the ſafegard of himſelfe and his Army, which was graunted, and a many of the Nobilitie choſen out as the great Patriarch of Moſco. KoeIacob Duke of Smalenſco, and others of great power, who being deliuered to the Cholcoſce, ſent them all as pledges to the King of Pole. Thus Cholcoſce hauing taken poſſeſſion of the Citty mariheth through to fight with Demetrius, and in ſhort time ouerthrew him, who fléeing againe to Colloge, found himſelfe there alſo abandoued of all his friends. Thus this vnhappy Prince, fleeing from place to place, finding no place for ſafetie, was afterward (as I haue heard it reported) miſerably ſlaine by a Tartar.
               
               Thus Cholcoſce returning backe to the Citty in triumphant maner, was ſolemnely intertained of the Muſcouite, who preſented him alſo with many great gifts. He hauing ſtayed a while in the Cittie, and planted a garriſon of eight thouſand Poles in the Caſtle, returned to Smalenſco with his priſoner Vanſuſce and deliuered him to his maiſter the King of Pole, who not long after ſent him into Poland, to be kept priſoner at the Caſtle of Waringborrough, where he yet liues a miſerable captine.
               
                  Sigiſmond the yeare following takes in Smalenſco vpon aſſault, and returnes into Poland, diſpoſing the moſt part of his Armie into garriſons in Ruſſia. But the Muſcouite in ſhort time after rebelled, and hauing drawne the Tartare as their Aſſiſtants, after a long and bloudie aſſault,

they at the laſt recouered the Cittie and Caſtle of Moſco, putting all the Poles to the ſword. Thus was the Colloge againe fréed, but not ſecured from the tyranny of the Poales, who are ſtill poſſeſſors of a great part of that Countrey, ſometimes loſing in one place, oftentimes gaining in an other, neuer reſting, but ſtill in action, which the wretched people doe miſerably ſuſtaine. And thus (as I vnderſtand) ſtands the condition of this torne Empire of Ruſſia at this day.
            
            FINIS.
