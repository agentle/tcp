                  ter the comyn opynyon that it was John euangelyſt as ſaint Jerome alſo telleth in the prologue of the goſpel of iohn. at the whyche brydale our lady Jhūs moder was as ſhe that was the eldeſt and moſte worthy of the thre ſyſters. And therfore ſhe was not bydden nor cleped thyder as other ſtraūgers weren / but ſhe was there in her ſiſters hous homely as in her owen hous ordeynyng & myniſtryng as mayſtres therof. And that we may vndſtande by thre euydences of the proceſſe of y• goſpel. Fyrſt by that the goſpel ſayth fyrſt / that the moder of Jhein was there / & after that Jheſus & hys diſcyples weren cleped or bidden therto. And ſo as we ſuppoſe it befell yt what tyme oure ladyes ſiſter Mary ſalome y• wyf of zebedee ſhapte to wedde her ſone John. ſhe yede before to oure lady to Nazareth that was fro y• Chane aboute four myle. ſaieng that ſhe wolde make a brydale to her ſone John / And ſoo thenne oure lady wente wyth hir to ordeine therfore certayne dayes before Soo that when other gheſtes were bede / ſhe was there all redy and homely be fore. ¶ The Seconde euydence is that ſhe knewe defaute of wyne. wherfore it ſemeth that ſhe ſatte not at that mete as other gheſtes that were beden. but that ſhe yede aboute mynyſtrynge as one of them that delyuerden mete and drynke and other neceſſaryes / wherfore ſhe perceyued by tyme and ſawe the defaulte of wyne / And tolde preuely her ſone therof / for helpe and remedy / and that myght ſhe not haue do yf ſhe hadde ſette amonge other wymen but ſhe had ryſen fro the borde that is not ſemely to be & alſo it is not to leue that ſhe that was vertuouſly ſhamfaſte. ſat by her ſo ne among men. wherfore it foloweth that ſhe ſatte not as a gheſte. but mynyſtred as it is ſayd before / ¶ The thyrde euydence herof is / that ſhe bad the ſeruaūtes for to goo to hyr ſo

ne / and that they ſholde do what that he badde them do / And ſo it ſemeth that he was ouer hem: & that the brydale was gouerned by hyr / & therfor ſhe was beſy that no default were there at. wherfore we may take hede & vnderſtande the maner of thys brydale & the proceſſe of the myracle therat done thus.

Thys ſeme the an hard & a boſtous anſwere to hys moder / But neuerthe leſſe it was ſayd in myſtery & for our ductryne and techynge as ſaint Bernarde ſayth. and as it ſhall be tolde after the proceſſe / But of this hard & ſtraūge anſwere as to ſemynge hys moder was not diſtourbled ne in deſpeyre / but fully truſtynge in his grete godenes & benignite ſhe wente ageyne to y• ſeruaū

dyng of our lord they fylleden the ſtenes that were ful of water / And anone at hys bleſſyng all y• water was tornyd in to wyne / And thenne he badde them drawe therof / And bere to the archetryclyne. that is to ſaye the mooſt worthy perſone of alle the hgeſtes in that hous. In the whyche byddyng we may ſee fyrſte the dyſcrecyon of our lorde. in that he ſente that wyne fyrſte to the moſte worſhypfull man. Alſo we maye ſee here by that our lorde ſatte fere fro hym in that he ſayd. Bereth hyt to Archetryclyne. And ſo ſythen he ſatte in the hygeſte place it ſemeth that oure lorde ſatte in the loweſt place / as it was ſayd before. And whan he hadde taſted the wyne & preyſed it / and he & other dronken therof. the mynyſtres that knewen how it was made tolden openly the myracle / And thenne hys dyſcyples byleueden in hym more ſadly as for the fyrſt myracle that they ſeen done before hem / And ſoo in that Jheſus ſhewed hys blyſſe & hys godhede ¶ Afterward whan the
