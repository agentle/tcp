                  •
               uenſberg, Lord of Rauenſtein. To our welbeloued and truſtie, the moſt reuerend religious, high, wel learned and deuoted, all and ſingular, generall and ſpeciall

Superintendants Prelates, Ouerſeers. Pariſh Prieſts: And in generall, To all Miniſters of the Church vnder our Dominions, of the Electorats and Marqueſſate of Brandenburg, on this and the other ſide of the Riuer of Oder, doe ſend our greeting; And beſides we doe declare and let them know, That godly and Religious Princes, Soueraignes, and Magiſtrates in all Countries, and at all times haue conſidered properly to belong to their high places, offices, and charges to looke vnto ſubordinate cauſes, and to endeuor themſelues, That all the vnneedfull and friuolous contentions and diſputations in the Pulpits, and all calumniations and comminations may be aboliſhed, put downe, and taken away out of the Church, but eſpecially ſuch as ſtifle, and ouer-boldly doe vndertake the ſame, and contrary to all Chriſtian loue and charity, arrogantly doe eyther aſſume or preſume authority, to cenſure, taxe, and pronounce for Heretickes, yea and wholly to diſallow and condemne other churches within and without the Empire (ouer which they haue not any charge to command or cenſure) not only with vnſeemly ſharp and bitter words, but alſo with all kinde of notable and malicious ſurnames and ſlaunders, whereby the common people is not onely ſcandalized, and the Church preiudiced: But the ediſication thereof is alſo apparently hindered.
            And to omit and leaue all ancient examples and preſidents of other Princes, That haue

beene carefull and prouident to take order for all ſuch triuiall and friuolous contentions and diſputations in the Pulpits or elſe where, wee finde a commendable Example, and Memoriall of the late excellent prince Elector, Auguſtus of Saxonia, in the yeare of our Lord God 1566. and of the Dukes alſo of Brownſwicke and Lunenburg, in the yeare of our Lord 1562. in the name of the common and generall churches of lowe Saxonia. Likewiſe the prince Elector Chriſtian the firſt of Saxonia, and duke Ioachim Fredericke at Lignitz and Brieg, in the yeare 1601, Princes of famous memory haue left behind them this moſt commendable Example to immitate them. And not onely the aforeſaid Preſidents haue moued vs heereunto, but alſo amongſt others this is not the leaſt; That we haue had conference with other Electors princes, and States, (howbeit there are very many amongſt them, that do profeſſe D. Luthers doctrine, yet we are agreed together) That in our countries and dominions alſo ſhould be taken ſuch order and prouiſion, that there might euery way bee vſed and obſerued all diſcretion and moderation by the Clergie in the Pulpits, and other publike aſſemblies: For to ſhun and auoyd all ſcandall; perturbation, or rather an intrication of conſciences, and preiudice to the Church. Therefore euery man may eaſily perceiue and conſider, what griefe it hath beene vnto vs. That now, a reaſonable long time, there hath, by ſome of you (for in generall I can

not accuſe you) and ſurely by ſuch as are induced and entiſed thereunto, not out of a ſpeciall zeale towards the truth of GOD, but rather out of ambition, arrogancie and pride, yet they could ſay and ſpeake the leaſt to it, if it ſhould come to a triall, or elſe, if they could but get a little gaine by it, they would turne quite papiſts, becauſe that they ſeeke rather to be praiſed by men then God; beene vſed without all ſhame and feare, ſo many acclamations, condemnations, ſlanderings, thunderings, and reproachings, and at many times little regarding whether they bring foorth the truth or vntruth or whether it be fitting or not fitting in the pulpit, but onely to diſcomfort true Chriſtians, and to make them grieue at it, when they in cooling their ſtomackes doe powre out their gall and venime, and make the Jeſuites and Papiſts (our common and publique enemies) reioyce at it and make a laughing ſtocke of vs; beſides this, they doe heere withall, but heape vpon themſelues, and vpon their Auditors, the anger and wrath of God. For the holy▪ Scripture teacheth vs quite otherwiſe, not willing that they that are vnited, and agreed with vs in the true grounds of faith and religion, and conſtantly and faithfully beleeue onely to be ſaued by, and through GODS mercy & the moſt precious merits of our only redeemer, Mediator and Sauiour Jeſus Chriſt▪ excluding and putting away all other Mediators and helpers, ſhould either haue any priuate diſturbance

of conſcience, or receiue other wrongs by publique ſcandals and calumniations, nor ſuch as doe with vs alſo plant foorth Chriſt his Goſpel, and ſtiffely fight for the ſame, and for the Goſpels ſake, yet haue they ſuſtained and ſuffred of the Pope and his followers (common enemies of our true Religion) many innumerable perſecutions, and doe daily ſuſtaine and ſuffer them ſtill, yea they haue very often with a ſpeciall courage and magnanimity, gladly ſpent their bloods for the Goſpels ſake, then why ſhould they bee excluded and ſeperated out and from the Chriſtian Communion? Moreouer, the Scripture doth very earneſtly commaund vs: That all matters in controuerſie and in queſtion ſhould not be rebuked, reprooued, and contradicted by friuolous wordes, and ſlander, (which is the proper nature of the Diuell) nor by heare-ſaying, and falſe witneſſes, nor in malicious and deteſtable manner, but out of meere ground of the word of God. The Scripture commandeth moreouer, that it ſhall bee done and performed with Chriſtian loue, and a meeke ſpirit, with friendſhip, patience, and with hartie compaſſion of thoſe that be in error, and not with contentious, ſlanderous, and iniurious wordes to the vndoing and deſtruction of the erroneous. Therefore euery one can iudge by himſelfe, how farre theſe thundering exclaimers, aboue mentioned, doe deſtray from the right way, and what inſupportable iudgement in the end ſhall come vpon them that doe

indeuor themſelues to rule much more ouer the conſciences of man, then to further and increaſe the Church of God with good examples.
            And foraſmuch as it belongeth vnto vs, as Soueraigne of theſe countries▪ by God appointed to follow and vſe our office according vnto the firſt and the ſecond Table of the ten Commandements of God; and becauſe we will not make our ſelues partakers of ſuch heauie ſins: Therefore we doe ſtatute, ordaine, and command (howbeit many of you are already perſonally admoniſhed thereof, although little by you regarded,) That yee heereafter ſhall indeuor your ſelues to preach and teach to the congregation and flocke committed to your ſeueral charges, the pure and cleare word of GOD, out of the Scriptures, of the Prophets, and Apoſtles, out of the foure capitall Symboles or Creedes, out of the reformed confeſſion of Augſpurg and the Apologie thereof, and without any deprauation and falſifying of the Scriptures, as alſo without the formular gloſſes of new Doctrine, which ſome lazie, curious, and prowd Theologians haue deuiſed and forged amongſt themſelues, to obtaine therewith the primacie in the Church and Secular power to themſelues ye ſhall teach therefore and inſtruct the people with the pure word of God: For you ſhall draw more ſoules to the church of Chriſt, in ſeeking only the honor and glory of God, and the ſaluation of the people. And to the contrarie, you ſhal leaue and ſhunne all railing, ſlandering,

curſing, and banning other Churches that are not committed to your charges, and which as yet neuer were conuicted of anie errour by their due confeſſion. For we cannot for conſcience ſake, longer abide and be ſilent vnto the ſame, and therefore if wee doe heare and perceiue, That one or more amongſt you (whoſoeuer hee or they bee, none excepted) that ſhall heereafter contemptuouſly tranſgreſſe this our earneſt and ſtraight Edict, being conformable to the word of God, they may certainely aſſure themſelues, that they ſhall be ſent for foorthwith to appeare at the Court, and there in our behalfe to be heard, and our meaning propounded vnto them. And if we then yet cannot perceiue amendment in them, that he or they ſhall be put out of their place and office, and diſmiſſed the ſame. Likewiſe they there ſhall be proceeded againſt with due iuſtice, and ſeueritie of the Law that being ſent for will not appeare, that they may bee brought to obedience: And wee doe admit and grant, and it is not againſt our will and pleaſure, that if there be any zealous and curious among them that ſhall thinke their conſciences to bee too ſtraightly and narrowly charged with this our Chriſtianlike and well-minded Edict and Proclamation, that they may prouide themſelues otherwiſe with our full and free liberty and conſent, and depart out of our Dominions, and take their reſidence in ſuch places where ſuch vnchriſtian contentions, railings, calumniations, ſlandering, curſing,

and banning other Chriſtians and their co-members may be permitted and allowed vnto them: For which they may expect, in time, of God Almightie their reward. Moreouer, we do ſtatute, and our will and pleaſure is, That if any of our Clergie for obeying this our Edict & commaund ſhould be inuaded by other peacehating people, and prouoked and entiſed to enter into diſpute with them by preaching or writing. That they to the contrary ſhall not commence nor beginne any thing without our ſpeciall priuitie, conſent and leaue, much leſſe to make any ſtrife amongſt them, but rather ſhall bee contented by the teſtimony and witnes of his conſcience, and that he or they are innocent and vnguilty to the actions and doings pretended by other vnquiet ſpirites. And we doe not doubt, That as we haue publikely proclaimed and openly publiſhed vnto all men this our Edict or Proclamation by induction of the word of God, onely to the end to procure, eſtabliſh and further the peace, quietnes, vnitie, and edification of the Church in thoſe Countries which are by the Almightie GOD committed vnto vs in theſe laſt and very dangerous days, wherein the Roman Antichriſt thirſteth more, then before, after the blood of true Chriſtians. That alſo euery one amongſt you will be diligent, and indeuour themſelues to maintaine peace, and vnitie, to auoyd all ſcandalls, and to ſhew their duetifull obedience, conſidering the command of the Apoſtle Paul, whereby hee

doth admoniſh and exhort euery one to be obedient to their Soueraignes and Magiſtrates, and that yee may know that they doe not beare the ſword for nothing, and in vaine, and that yee doe not moue vs to diſpleaſure or indignation, or to vſe againſt you the ſtreight and ſharp courſe of the Lawe. And hereby you ſhall fullfill our gracious, and likewiſe finall will, and good meaning, which towards you (vpon ſure confidence of duetifull acknowledgement and obedience) we will be alwayes willing and ready to make manifeſt. In witneſſe whereof wee haue commanded our Signet to be heereupon imprinted. Dated at our Court at Colln vpon the Riuer of Sprew the 24. day of the moneth of February 1614.
