               The sinner touched
with his own sinnes,
and terrified with
Gods iudgment, flyeth
vnto Christ.
            
            
               O Christ, the
Sonne of
the most
myghtye
God, the Sauiour of
most miserable men;

whose blessed bodie
was buffeted with
siftes, torne with
whips, stretched vpō
the crosse, pierced
with nailes & speare▪
and bathed in the
sweete streames of
thine owne bloud,
for the redēption of
all mankind: to thee,
O author, O restorer,
O preseruer of life, to
thy maiestie, to thy
mercie, my sinnefull
soule, full of fresh
bleeding woundes.

ful of ould corrupted
soares, sicke to the
death with a surfet of
sinne, would faine
present it selfe, and
sende a few fainte
groanes vnto thy
heauenly eares.
            but alas, the greatnesse
of my disease
hath almost taken away
the sence thereof;
and so horrible is
my corruptiō, that I
feare it wil too much
offend thy pure presence?
and altogether

auert, thy coūtenāce
from beholding me,
thine eare from hearing
me, and thy cō
               passion
from relieuing
me.
            O sinne, the verie
bane and death of
my soule, was it not
enough for you to
infect a heedeles creature
with your poison,
but you must
make it so ougly and
loathsome, that the
eie of mercie should
not endure to beehould

it? was it not
enough for you to
crush it in pieces
with your weight,
but you must also go
about to stop, both
the eare of pittie with
horror, & the mouth
of prayer with
shame? was it not inough
for you to
drawe me to distruction,
but you must
also take from mee,
both the sence of
griefe, and the sight
of danger; and consequently,

the cure of
the one, and care of
the other?
            I was wounded &
I felte it not: I was
wounded to death,
& I perceiued it not:
I was bound, I was
beaten, and I regarded
it not: yea, my
woundes were a delightfull
tickling vnto
mee, I tooke pleasure
in most base bō
               dage,
and (like Salomons
foole) I laughed
when I was lashed.

For I was beside my
selfe, whē I was without
thee, neither discerning
and desiring
that which was good
nor yet seeing and
shunning that which
was euill. I beecame
not only foolish, but
altogether sencelesse;
for thou art trueth, &
I was without thee,
thou art life, & I was
without thee.
            Alas how am I deformed?
how am I
defiled? O deere

Christ, my fainting
soule groaneth and
gaspeth for thy grace,
but it is abashed at
thy glory: I would
faine intreat thy mercy
to heale mee, but I
am loth to offend thy
maiestie in beeholding
mee: I am ashamed
to lay open my
iniquities, and yet
(woe is me) I cannot
appeare beefore thee
without them.
            Ah these my sinnes,
how do they distres?

how do they distract
me? they desire to be
seene, that they may
bee healed; but they
shunne to be shewn,
least they should bee
detested: they are not
healed without confession,
and they are
not heard without
confusion: If they be
couered they cannot
be cured, and if they
be opened they must
needes be abhorred.
In the meane time,
their sharpenes pierceth

me, their waight
presseth me, they torment
me with griefe,
they terrifie me with
feare, they confound
me with shame.
            What shall I say,
or what shall I doe,
wretche that I am,
whether did I bende
my selfe, and to what
pas am I now come?
O Christ, I did not
set thee beefore my
eyes, and now I
dare not appeare
in thy sight: I reioyced

but not in thee, &
now I am troubled,
but thou art not with
me. Alasse, better it
were to bee nothing,
then to bee without
thee, without whom
al things are nothing;
better it were to bee
dead, then to be without
thee, O our life.
            Wo to me wretch,
what shall I do in that
terrible day, when at
the sound of the trū
               pet
all graues shall open,
& yeeld vp their

prisoners, which they
haue kept fast fettered
in the chaines of
death, from all ages
since the worlde was
made. When the
bookes of euery mās
naked conscience
shall be laide foorth:
when all my actions,
words and thoughts,
euen those which I
most esteemed, either
concealed, or els forgotten,
shall bee set in
so open and plaine a
veiw, that all the

worlde shall point at
mee, and say, Behold
the man and what hee
hath done. When I
shall bee compelled
to aunswer to manie
thinges, whereof I
would haue scorned
to haue bene either
questioned or tould,
during the time of
my life. when the
heauens shall threatē
me, the earth rise vp
against me, and al the
creatures which I
haue abused crie vē
               geance

vpon mee:
when the Diuelles
shall accuse mee, my
own conscience giue
euidence against me,
and the whole Iurie
of Saintes passe their
verdict vpon me.
            At that day to go
forward it will be intolerable;
to go back,
impossible; to turne
a side, vnauaileable:
and so great will bee
the astonishment, betwene
sorrow, shame
and feare, that the

guiltie sinner shall be
desirous to hide him
selfe, (if it were possible)
euen in hell.
            What way shall I
thē take in these desperate
extremities?
whether shall I turne
my selfe? what shift,
what friendes shall I
be able to make? all
thinges giuing cause
of terrour, and nothinge
of comforte.
Alasse, what shall I
do, but euen faint for
feare, and stande as a

most desperate and
forlorne wretch, trē
               blinge
and quakinge
beefore the presence
of the most seuere
iudge, who neither
can bee blinded, nor
will bee corrupted;
altogether confounded,
at the intollerable
vehemencie and
waight of his wrath,
at the inexcusable
number and enormity
of my sinnes, at the
easelesse and endlesse
punishment which I

shall see I haue deserued.
            Who, where, what
thinge shall then bee
my comfort? when
I shall behold, aboue,
an angrie Iudge condemning
mee; beeneath,
hell open, and
the boyling furnace
ready to deuour me;
on one side, the diuels
with bitter scoffes
and vpbraydings
haling me; on the other
side, the saintes
and my very neerest

friendes, not onely
forsaking me, but reioycing
and praysing
God for his iustice in
my damnatiō: within,
my conscience
tearing me; without,
the powers of heauē
shakē and dissolued,
the elementes shiuered
in peeces; the
whole worlde flaming,
& all damned
soules crying & cursing
rounde about
mee.
            O indignation of

of the almightie, fall
not vpon mee; for I
haue neither power
to resist thee, nor patiēce
to endure thee,
nor place to auoyde
thee. And doubtlesse,
it is impossible, ether
to expresse, or to imagine,
what an inestimable
treasure a
good conscience will
be at that day: and if
a sinner could now
conceiue the infinite
sea of terrours and
tormentes, whiche

then he shal perceiue
to rush vpon him, he
would not endure
them one moment,
for all the false pleasures
that his sweetest
sinnes can afford.
            Alasse wretch,
what shall I doe? if I
speake, my sinnes
stand vp against me:
& if I hold my peace,
I find no mā to comfort
mee. Mourne O
my soul, drowne thy
selfe in bitter mourning;
howle out and

lament beecause of
these heauy horrours
which thine offences
prepare daily to heap
vpon thee: thou being
as vnable to repel
the one, as either to
represse, or repente
the other.
            And yet now thou
doest see these euils,
see also if thou canst
shunne them; let no
paynes bee too great,
no petitions either to
often, or too earnest

to make prouision agaynste
that daye:
trample vnder foote
the vanities of this
life; shake them off,
as Paul did the viper
into the fire, lest they
cause thee to shake.
Runne, O runne vnto
thy onely refuge
Iesus Christ thy redeemer,
become (as
it doth become thee)
an humble suppliant,
in the lowest degree
both of sorrow and
shame: prostrate thy

selfe beefore his presence,
poure out thy
teares at his feete,
make an abiect countenance
and gesture,
vnfained messengers
of thy distressed
mind; let thy words
bee seasoned with
sighes, and bathed in
tears, & so addresse
thy suite vnto him.
Although it bee late,
it is not yet too late to
call for his mercie: &
wherefore shouldest
thou be consumed in

saying nothing? As
it is impossible hee
should forgette the
passions which hee
endured, so it is not
credible that hee
should not haue cō
               passion
on thee for
whome he suffered.
            O Christ, O sonne
of the euerlyuinge
God, in goodnes infinite,
infinite also in
greatnes, in power
almighty, in wisdome
wonderfull, in iudgment
iust, in promise

true, in workes holy,
in mercie rich, patient
toward sinners, &
sparing when they
do repent: call to thy
remēbrance, O sweet
Iesus, for whose sake
thou wert content to
endure all the miseries
of mortallitie: hū
               ger,
colde, griefe, pouerty,
contēpt, scorn,
blasphemies, bandes,
blowes, the crosse,
woundes, death, and
the graue.
            And now, O Lord,

where is this loue?
where are these mercies?
is thy goodnesse
come to an end? and
will thine anger neuer
againe be appeased?
If I be full of impietie,
art thou therfore
not full of pittie?
& if I cōfesse the one,
wilt thou therefore
denie the other? if my
sins are greater thē it
is meet, ar thi mercies
lesser then they were
wont? if thy glorious
greatnesse did make

me draw backe, wilt
thou therefore draw
backe thy gracious
goodnesse?
            O Lord my God,
althogh I am a sinner,
yet am I thi creature:
although I am a sinner,
yet am I redeemed
with the blessed
price of thy blood.
O Lord my life, It
was no goodnesse in
me that compelled
thee to make me, but
euen thy loue; it was
no merite in me that

did winne thee to redeeme
me, but euen
thy mercie: why then
sweet Christ and
most louing Iesu, let
that loue whiche
compelled thee to
make me, compell
thee also to help me;
let that mercy which
did win thee to die
for me, win thee also
to saue my life: for
thou art alwaies one,
neither is thy loue
chāged, nor thy mercy
diminished.
            
               
Heare me O Lorde,
heale mee O Lorde,
heale my sicke soule
which panteth at thy
feete, and is euen at
the poynt to perish:
reiect not him whoe
deiecteth him selfe,
let not the abasing of
my selfe make mee
seme base vnto thee:
enter not into iudgment
with thy seruant,
but accordinge
to thy mercies, to the
multitude of thy
mercies put awaye

mine iniquities.
            Thinke not on
thy hate against a sinner,
but think on thy
loue towardes thy
creature: remember
not thy iustice where
by thou punishest,
but remember thy
mercy wherby thou
sauest: forget mee as I
was disobediēt, prouoking
thee to wrath,
& regard me as I am
distressed, crying to
thee for helpe. Comforte
mee that am

weake, heale me that
am wounded, raise
me that am dead:
heale the infirmitie
which grieueth mee,
& thou shalt remoue
the deformity which
offendeth thee: take
awaie the wretchednesse
whereof I languish,
and thou shalt
take away the lothsō
               nes
which thou abhorrest:
free me from
my danger, and thou
shalte free thy selfe
from thy displeasure.
            
               
O sweete Lord &
most mercifull Iesus
Christ, wee knowe
wherefore thou camest
into the world,
euen to seeke and to
saue that which was
lost: and do not thou
O Lord forget that
which we, vile wretches,
not only know,
but shal acknowledg,
eyther wyth trembling,
or els with ioy.
Thou camest to saue
that which was lost,
and wilt thou see me

perish, in the view of
thy pittifull eies, in
the presence of thy
bowels of mercy?
Thou camest to call
sinners to repētance,
& wilt thou not heare
them when they doe
repent? thou camest
to seeke those which
wandred, & to assemble
those which were
dispersed, and wilt
thou not receiue
those which com vnto
thee, which crye
after thee, which call

vpon thee?
            Thou diddest not
stop thine eares whē
thou wert blasphemed;
and wilt thou
stop them now thou
art intreated? thou
didst not turne away
thy face from those
that spat vpon thee
and buffeted thee, &
wilt thou now turne
it away from those
that pray vnto thee?
            O thou hope of
my hart, & strength
of my soule, whether

should I run for succour,
to whome
should I resort, but
onely vnto thee, who
art the reconciler, the
redeemer, the Sauiour
of mankinde? O
reconciler, whome
wilt thou reconcile
to thy Father, if thou
reiectest a poore sinner,
who condemneth
himselfe, & calleth
vppon thee? if
death shall deuour
him who dispaireth
in himselfe, and trusteth

in thee? if that
soule shall bee drowned
in hell, which
acknowledgeth his
owne wickednesse
with feare, and thy
goodnesse with loue?
O redeemer whome
hast thou then redeemed?
O Sauiour
whome then wilte
thou saue?
            O Christ heare
mee, O Christ helpe
mee, or else tell mee
thy vnwoorthy seruaunt,
O mercifull

God, tel thy seruant,
to whome shall I cry?
to whome shall I
complaine? who is
more able to helpe?
who more easy to be
intreated? to whom
may I flie more safely?
to whome more
readily? who is more
mighty? who more
mercifull? where may
I bee more bolde?
where more secure?
            O thou onely refuge
& reliefe of the
distressed, to whome

no man sueth without
hope of helpe,
forsake mee not now
I call vpon thee, for
before I did call vpon
thee, thou diddst call
mee; and to the end
that I should seeke
after thee, thou diddest
seeke out mee.
Sweete Iesus I praise
thee for this voluntarie
guift of thy goodnes,
O let it not be vnprofitable
vnto mee:
Finish that which
thou hast begun, and

giue mee the thinge
which thou hast moued
me to desire.
            Heare my praier,
& haue mercie vpon
me a forsaken orphane;
looke vpon
the teares of my miserie.
Haue mercie
vpon me, O sonne of
Dauid, O fountain of
mercie, haue mercie
vpon me; let my
soule be the sea to
swallow vp those
streames which flow
from thee, O fountaine

of mercy. Heale
the diseased, helpe
the distressed which
crieth to thee for
comfort.
            O light, behold the
blinde; O strength,
stretch forth thy hād
that the lame may
come vnto thee; O
life, raise the deade
out of the sepulchre
of his sinnes.
            O mercrfull louer
of mankind, ah shew
thy selfe vnto me; reueale
thy glorie, reueale
thy grace, oh

let me beehold oh
let mee hold thee.
            Let mee finde, let
mee feele, that thou
onely art the hope of
the distressed, the reliefe
of the afflicted,
the comforte, the
strength, the ioy of
all. O Christ, let me
not in vaine beleeue
this trueth: O Christ
let mee not in vaine
lay hold vpon this
hope: O Christ, let
me not in vaine desire
this mercie.

And if my faith be so
little, my hope so
colde, my prayer so
weake, that I can
thereby deserue, neither
pardon of my
punishment, nor participation
of thy glorie;
supplie thou I beseech
thee my imperfections,
that by thy
mercy I may obtaine
the one, and by thy
merites the other.
            O Sweete Iesu, O
my God, bring mee
from all ontward

thinges to my selfe,
and from my selfe
vnto thee: make mee
as like to thee in will
and desier, as I am in
nature: set me wholly
on fire with thy
loue; thy sweete
loue, thy longinge
loue, thy chast loue;
with desire of thee,
with contentmente,
with ioy, with saciety
in thee. Let this light
of thy loue captiuate
my sences from all
other both lightes &

delightes, let it cleere
my soule from the
grosse vapors of
earthly affections;
that I may thereby,
if not fully satisfie, yet
shew my selfe industrious
to satisfie thy
goodnes and goodwill;
and that as hetherto
I haue liued against
my selfe, and
without thee, so from
henceforth I may
leade my life, for my
selfe, in and by thee,
sweete Iesus Amen.

causeth the soule to

mercie.
            
            
               O Soule, O
wicked, O
wretched
soul, shake
off sloath, this sleepe,
this death of sinne,

wherin thou walowest,
and wherin thou
wanderest: raise vp,
rowse vpp thy selfe
from this dangerous
dulnes. Call to thy
consideration (vnhappie
creature)
from whence thou
runnest, where thou
art, and wherto thou
hastnest: the fauour
which thou forsakest,
the horrour wherein
thou abidest, and the
terrour wherto thou
tendest.
            
               
Thou wert once
washed cleane with
the heauēly fountain
in baptisme, cloathed
with the pure robe of
righteousnesse, endowed
wyth the
ioies of heauen, and
espoused to my Sauiour
Christ: but now
thou hast soiled thy
selfe with sinne, defiled
that glorious garment,
broken those
sacred bandes, and
by impuritye of life
hast made thy louing

spouse, both thine
earnest enemie, and
seuere iudge.
            O Christ, how can
I forget thy goodnes,
and yet how dare I
remember thy greatnesse?
I haue denied
thee with Peter, beetraied
thee with Iudas,
and runne from
thee with thy other
disciples: nay, with
the most accursed
cruell Iewes, I haue
mocked, blasphemed,
buffeted and

scourged thee; spitte
vppon thy glorious
face, & torne opē thy
tēder wounds. Then
since I haue committed
theire crueltie,
what hope may I
haue to auoide their
curse; that thy bloud
be not vpon me, and
my posteritie?
            Alas (miserable
wretch) in what path
haue I walked? in
what pollutions
haue I wallowed? &
in what perplexities

am I now plunged?
wherein, the consideration
both of
good and euill tormenteth
me a like: of
good, with griefe of
that which I haue
lost: of euell, partly
with sence of that
which I sustaine: and
partly with feare of
that which I expect. I
haue lost glory, I feele
shame, I feare punishment:
the losse is by
mee irrepairable the
shame inexcusable,

the feare inconsolable.
Oh miserable
estate, oh vncomfortable,
not onely to be
depriued of vnspeakable
ioies, but to bee
afflicted with intollerable
paines.
            O sinne, the defiler,
the deformer, the
destroier of soules,
from how high a
pitch of happinesse
hast thou deiected
me? into how deepe
a gulfe of miseries
hast thou depressed

mee? with what a
world of woes hast
thou enclosed mee?
heere woe and there
woe, and a very hell
of woes is heaped
vppon mee.
            Iustly (Lord) iustly
am I thus tormented;
for I haue beene
fainte, yea false in the
charge that thou hast
committed vnto me:
I haue throwne away
my spirituall weapons;
I haue forsaken
the fielde of christian

combate; and not
onely cowardly yealded,
but traiterously
turned to the prince
of darknesse.
            I haue cast off my
Sauiour, and cast away
my selfe; I haue
forsaken the societie
of Saintes, & ioyned
companie with the
damned crew; I haue
abādoned the pallaces
of heauē, & built
mee a nest in the
loathsome denne of
hell: I am altogether

become an abiect
from God and a subiect
to the Deuill.
            What hast thou
done, O madd man,
O mischieuous, O
monstrous man,
what hast thou done?
what a wofull exchange
hast thou
made? what a lamentable
losse hast thou
incurred? O peruerse
will, O miracle of
madnes. How, O
God, hath corruption
depraued mee?

how O God shall satisfaction
restore me?
            Cast thy selfe (forlorne
wretch) into
the vncomfortable
dungeon of sorrow,
ouerwhelme thy self
with mountaines of
bitter mourning:
come griefe, come
horror, cōe anguish,
come feare; heape
your felues vpon me,
wrap me in, weigh
me downe, I haue
impudently contemned
you, I haue desperately

prouoked
you, and now doe
miserably call for
you.
            So, so, it is iust, afflict
the wicked, torment
the guiltie, reuenge
the iniuries,
reuenge the periuries
which I haue committed
against God:
giue the sinner a
touch of the infernall
tortures which hee
hath deserued: giue
him a tast of the banquet
which he hath

prepared. Comforte,
peace, securitie, ioy,
keepe away, I will
none of you, except
you bring a pardone
with you: disquiet
shallbe my rest,
mourning my mirth,
sowre sorrowe my
comforte.
            Alas, how shall I
present my selfe before
the maiestie of
the most righteous
and vpright iudge?
how shall my fearfull
face behold him?

how terriblie will he
cast his countenance
vpon mee? His eyes
farre brighter thē the
sunne, haue narrowly
obserued all my
actions, he hath
weighed my words,
he hath nombred my
thoughtes; he hath
seene, he hath sealed
vp all my sinnes: hee
hath hetherto bin silent,
hetherto patient;
but out alas, hee
will one day crie out,
one day he will call

mee to a reckoning
for all.
            O my hart, O
poore harte, O harte
full of miseries, yea
depressed, yea oppressed
with manyfold
miseries; neuer able
to sustaine these firebrandes
of conscience.
Alas mine eies
are not worthie to
looke towardes heauen:
yea, they are
most worthy to bee
extinguished with
teares. If then I be ashamed

to be seene,
how shall I be assured
to be receiued?
if I haue no harte to
aske, what hope can I
haue that I shall obtaine.
            Goe too then O
sinfull soule, enter againe
into the closet
of thy conscience,
turne ouer the books
of thy accountes, cast
thy reckoninges, set
downe thy summes;
see what thou hast
done, and what thou

hast deserued.
            
               Imprimis, for abusing

            The totall snmme
is, the manifest and
manifolde breach of
all thy commandementes.
            The penaltie is, eternall
banishmente
from thy presence, &
intollerable and endles
paines in hell fire.
            Out vppon mee
wretch, alas what
shall become of mee?
O my Lorde, I know
not what to do, I cannot
tel what answere

to make: and beeing
now in extremitye
both of danger and
feare, my cogitations
trouble me, my conscience
tormenteth
me, euery thought is
athorne vnto mee.
            Nay goe on then a
little further, looke
downe into hell, before
thou leape into
it; obserue there who
expects thy coming,
and what shall bee
thy entertainment.
            O good God,

what do I behold in
this infernal lake, nothing
but horror, tumultuous
and eternall
horrour; fierie
chaines, flaming
whippes, scorchinge
darknes, tormenting
diuels, and burninge
soules; howling, roaring
and lamenting,
woe and alas; with a
mad rage blaspheming
God; with a desperate
impatiencie,
cursing thē selues; tearing
(in a maner) their

owne substance, and
enuiting the furious
fiends to torment
them.
            Here euerie part of
the condemned prisoner
hath both a ful
and fitte charge of
punishment, without
either intermission
or change: the memorie is tormented
with pleasures
that are past; the vnderstanding, with
ioies that are lost; the
apprehension, with

paynes that are present;
and (aboue all,)
the conscience is griped
with euerie perticular
offence that
the sinner hath committed;
which once
were sweete, but thē
like serpents shall cruellye
and restlestlye
gnaw vpon him. Neuer
ceasing to rubbe
into his remēbrance,
how base were the
causes of his calamity
what warninge was
giuen, what meanes

were offered him to
haue auoided it; how
easilie he might, and
many times howe
neerely he had apprehended
the occasion;
and yet howe negligently,
how foolishly,
how madly hee
continued in his
careles course.
            Further, the sight
is afflicted with fearfull
darknes and vgly
diuells, the hearing
with horrible and
hidious cries, the

smell with poisonous
stink, the tast with
bitternes of gall, the
feeling with sharpnes
of fire.
            A fire, which as
nothing doeth feede
it, so it consumeth
nothing that it doeth
burne: a fire, which
hath no light to comfort,
but heate to
tormēt: a fire, whose
force shall neuer bee
either spent, or extinguished,
or yet abated:
but as longe as

God is God, so long
shall it tormente the
wicked; and that
with such vehemencie
of heate, that one
droppe of water to
bee applied to the
scorched tongue will
bee of greater valuation
then a thousand
worldes.
            And besides these
common tormentes,
euerie offender shall
haue his particulare
paines, according to
the difference of his

sinnes, either in qualitie,
or in kinde. Of
which paines, not
onely all, but any one
shallbe so grieuous,
& so intollerable, as it
is impossible for any
mortall wit, either to
expresse▪ or to imagine.
And yet shall
no creature bee grieued
at them; and endured
they must bee
without any hope,
FIRST, of intermission;
SECONDLY, of abatement;
THIRDLY

of change, (without
which thinges, not
onely painfull, but
indifferent, yea pleasant,
become insupportable;) FOVRTHLY,
of comforte, but
to the contrarye,
the diuelles shall
vpbrayde them, the
damned curse them,
and the Saintes deride
them; LASTLY,
of end, but after
so many millions of
ages as there are
drops of water in the

sea, the damned shall
bee as farre from eyther
end or ease of
their tormentes, as
they were the first
day of their beeginning.
            O intollerable punishment,
which no
meanes can moderate,
no patience can
endure, no time shal
end: Is this (O Lord)
the wages of sinne? is
this the punishment
of wicked doers, of
whome I am one, in

so deepe a degree?
and is it meruaile
then if my cōscience
quake? if my soule
cleaue with sighes?
and if my eyes bee
drowned in teares.
            But where am I,
and whether am I
carried? whether do
you driue me, O my
sinnes? whether, O
God, doest thou deliuer
mee? If my sins
haue made mee that
I am thy offender,
haue they also made

me that I am not thy
creature? If the Diuell
hath bereaued
mee of my puritie,
hath hee also beereaued
thee of thy pittie?
If thy iustice
may rightly damne
me, cannot thy mercies
possiblye saue
mee? and if I haue
deserued the one,
haue I thereby also
disclaymed the other?
            O mercifull Lord,
do not so looke vpon

mee, that thou see
not thy selfe: regard
no so my wickednesse
that thou beehold
not thy owne
goodnesse: remember
not so the sinnes
that I haue doone,
that thou forget the
substaunce which
thou hast made.
            What (O Lord)
is the sence of thys
saying? I will not the
death of a sinner, but I
desire that hee bee conuerted
and liue: is this

I will not the death of a
sinner, if thou reiectest
a sinnefull soul,
if thou drownest it
in hell, that crieth
vnto thee for mercy?
is this I desire that hee
be conuerted and liue?
            
            O gracious God,
whose word is a will,
and whose will is a
power, who doest
promise nothing but
that which thou dost
purpose, and who
dost purpose nothing
but that which thou

able to performe,
suffer me I pray thee,
to speake with thy
mercy; mee, I say,
earth and ashes, suffer
mee to speake
with thy mercy, for
great are thy mercies
towardes vs.
            Lord, if thou wilt
not the death of a sinner,
what necessitye
is there that I should
bee damned? If thou
desirest that a sinner
should be conuerted
and liue, what difficultie

is there that I
should not be saued?
can the power and
malice of the Deuill?
can the number, can
the enormitie of my
offences, either constraine
that which
thou wouldest not,
or hinder that which
thou desirest?
            No, no, my God,
the deuils tremble at
thy mightie maiesty:
and if the sinnes of
the whole worlde
were ballaunced against

the least of thy
mercies, they could
holde no weighte;
much lesse can the
offences of one wicked
wretch sway thy
Almighty and mercifull
will. For by
how much God is
greater then man, by
so much is my wickednesse
inferiour to
thy goodnesse.
            Haue mercy therfore
vpon me, O almighty
God, returne,
del
                  •
               uer my

soule, saue me for
thy mercies sake: for
if thou wilt thou
canst saue mee, and
in thy will resteth
the strength of my
hope.
            Remember not
thy iustice, and my
desertes, but remember
thy mercies, and
my miseries: thinke
not vpon thy hate towardes
offenders,
but thinke vpon thy
loue towardes thy
creatures: cast thy seuere

eye of reuenge
vpon thy sonne, but
looke vpon me with
thy eye of pitty.
            O deare God, hell
is alreadie full, and
what profite is there
in my distructiō? Also
many millions of
sinners will neuer
come vnto thee, will
neuer cal nor care for
thy helpe: so that if
thou reiectest the repentant
and sorrowfull

shall bee saued? and

            When I was not,
O Lord, thy fingers
framed mee, and
thou neither hatest
nor contemnest any
thinge that thou hast
made. When I was
a captiue of the deuill,
a slaue of hell,
thou didest send thy
beloued sonne to die
for my redemption:

thee, cast that away,

in my owne wicked

mightily preserue
me, and graciously
call mee; and wilt
thou not now beestow

            Why then (O louing
God) looke vpon
thy beloued
sonne: behold what

hee hath suffered, &
of thy goodnesse call
him to thy remembrāce,
for whom, thy
will & his obedience
did cause him to suffer.
Behold his bitter
agonies wherein his
bodie was sprinkled
with a bloodie
sweate; beeholde
his backe torne with
whips, his head pricked
with thornes, his
face defiled with spitting:
behold his blessed
body so strained

vpon the crosse, that
all his bones might
be numbred: behold
his harmlesse handes,
& his vndefiled feete
pierced with sharpe
nailes: behold his
naked side strooke
through with a
speare: behold the aboundance
of blood
which gushed forth
of those holy fountaines;
which blood
still streameth fresh
in thy sight, and now
pleadeth for my pardon.
            
               
Beholde (O gracious
God) how his
feeling was possessed
with paine, his hearing
with reproach,
his eies with scorne,
his tast with gall: beholde
howe his neck
bowed, his heade
hung, his breast beat;
how his sight waxed
dimme, his countenāce
pale, his legs &
armes stiffe, how hee
groaned; how hee
gasped and gaue vp

the ghost. Behold
the preist, behold the
sacrifice, euen the
lambe vndefiled, gloriously
imbrued with
his owne blood.
            Gracious and
mercifull God, by
this thy sonne, by
this my Sauiour, I
most humbly beeseech
thee to looke
fauourably vpon me;
encline thine eares
towardes me, hide
not thy face now my
soule is troubled.

Graciouslie receiue
the lost sheepe which
strayinge from thy
pastures through
sinne, and flying from
thy presence through
a guiltie conscience,
hee hath louinglye
sought, and ioyfullye
doth bring vnto thee
vpon his own shoulders.
Heare mee (O
God of all power) &
turne towardes mee;
and let thy mercies
accept his merits for
full satisfaction of my

misdeedes.
            O infinite mercie,
thou hast sett vs a
way, and giuen vs a
light; thou hast threaned
vs the paines of
hell, and promised vs
the ioies of heauen,
now pierce my flesh
with thy feare, that I
may auoide the one;
and inflame my soule
with thy loue, that I
may attain the other.
Grante I praye thee,
that as longe traueilers
are therby taught
to loue their owne

cuntrey, soe my former
err

               urs may
henceforth bee a

in the right path: that
beeing led by thee,
& walking through
thee, I may come vnto
thee, and rest in
thee: for wee (sillie
wormes) are vnable
to enter into thine eternitie,
vnlesse thou
who hast created vs,
doest guide vs in.
            Saue (O God
who desirest not the

deth of a sinner) saue
my sinnefull soule,
which flieth frō thy
feareful iustice, to thy
comfortable mercies;

most holye,
moste
mightye,
most mercifull, most

good, most goodly,
most louinge, most
fearefull and terrible
God; the Creator,
the renuer, the maintainer
of all thinges:
whome to know, is
to bee wise; whome
to serue, is to raigne;
whome to loue, is
the life and happinesse
of the soule: behold,
I pore wretch,
to thee who art both
rich, and liberall; I
miserable, to thee
who art both pittifull

and plentifull do
draw neere: behold,
a hunger-starued
begger knocketh at
thy doore; open vnto
mee, O honourable
householder,
without whome all
aboundance is beggerie;
open, I say,
thy mercies to my
miseries: and although
I am not
worthy to sitte at thy
feast with thy sons,
yet with the basest of
thy seruantes, let me

bee refreshed with
some broken pieces
that are taken from
thy table.
            Thou hast commaunded
vs, (O gratious
God) to knock,
to aske, and to seeke:
whereuppon thou
hast promised to open,
to geue, and to
bee founde: beholde
now my sighinge
doth seeke thee, my
teares crie vnto thee,
and the groanes of
my payned soule, do

knocke at the gate of
thy mercies: behold,
Lord, I am desirous
to doe thy will, performe
thou, I besech
thee, thy word.
            And first (O
Lorde) I acknowledge
against my
selfe, that I was conceiued
in iniquitie,
and borne in miserie;
but thou of thy
free loue diddest
cleanse mee, thou
diddest sanctifie me,
thou didst through

faith on my part and
mercy on thyne betroath
thy selfe vnto
me.
            Yet I, vnmindfull
of so greate goodnes,
haue since, with many
a foule fact, distained
my selfe, and
dishonored thee; not
dreading thy displeasure,
whole wrath
maketh the deuells
to quake. I was borne
in necessary, but I plū
               ged
my selfe in voluntarie
sinnes, I
made no conscience

in offending thee, &
feared not to forgett
thy lawe.
            Notwithstandinge
thou, accordinge to
thy wonted mercies,
diddest not banish
mee from thy protection;
but as
though I had daylye
and duly obserued
thy will, thou diddest
bountifullye heape
thy benifites vppon
mee; so much vndeserued
of mee, as not
desired.
            
               
When I sinned against
thee, the deuill
was readie to haue
made a pray of mee,
I was content, I was
desirous to haue
perished with him:
but thou (O Lord)
diddest driue backe
him, and draw backe
me; not onely without
either my request
or knowledge,
but very much against
my mind.
            When I was in
daunger of death,

both by sickenesse &
casualties, and my
soule was so rocked
a sleepe in sinnefull
securitie, so burdened
with the weight
of wicked actions,
that it must needes
haue suncke downe
into hell; thy grace
stoode by mee, thy
power did preserue,
both my body from
death, and my soule
from damnation.
            I did offend thee,
but thou diddest defend

mee. I did deserue
death, but thou
diddest preserue life;
I did not regard thee,
when thou diddest
safely guard mee: I
(like a wretch eyther
sencelesse of desperate)
did forsake thee,
and flie vnto mine
enemie; I did long, I
did labour to haue
bene lost: but thy
care did keepe mee,
whilest I busied in
vayne thinges neuer
marked so much; thy

loue did seeke with
very greate and gracious
fauours to win
mee vnto thee.
            But as one that is
sicke of a sleepie disease
cannot bee awaked
but by pinching;
soe out of this lethargie
of sinne, my sleepy
soule (neither vnworthie
nor vnwilling
to haue perished)
could not be called
to it selfe, but by
some sharpe and sensible

accident.
            Heereupon thou
begannest to runne
with me a more rugged
race, laying many
kind crosses vpon
mee; not onelye to
bend my vnwilling,
but to breake my wilfull
minde, and to
make it appliable to
thy pleasure. Thou
diddest call mee out
of the wildernesse of
worldlye delightes,
wherin my guiltines
would haue hid it

selfe from thy presence;
thou diddest
compell mee out of

                  ••
               e high way to hell;
thou diddest take me
vpp strayinge in the
streetes to attend vpon
thee; thou diddest
enter couenant with
thy seruāt, thou diddest
stirre in mee a
desire, & strengthen,
an indeuour to follow
thee: thou diddest
instruct, thou
diddest enable, both
my vnderstandinge,

and also my power;
that to discerne, this
in some degree of
duty to do thy will.
            Yet I (wretch that
I am) since my entrance
into thy seruice;
haue either vngraciously
forgottē,
or vngratfullye remembred
all thy benifites,
and haue not
so esteemed thee for
them, as I would
haue done a mortall
friend for a few curtisies
of course. I haue

forsaken thee againe,
and followed the
right trace of the vnrighteous
world;
thinking euery thing
good whose euell I
had not tried. I haue
prouoked thee, I
haue stirred vp thine
anger, I haue deserued
thy displeasure,
I haue done euell in
thy sight; not ignorātly
but presumptuously;
not weakly but
wilfully; not fearfully,
but impudently

hauing not onely lost
the tender touch of
conscience, but beeginning
to beare my
selfe (an offence beeyond
the degree of
my vile word) in a
brauerie of euell.
            Alas how deepely
hath corruption tainted
my soule? what
folly hath not had
his feate in my mind,
and left his footsteps
in my actions? Nay, I
haue farre exceeded
the limites of follye;

noe man not banished
from his owne
wittes, would thus
haue bin entrapped,
thus entangled. I
should haue repented
mee of my former
sinnes, but I
haue in such sorte
both encreased & aggrauated
thē; that I
haue scarce left, eyther
number for
more, or place for
worse.
            O my God, what
answere shal I make?

how shall I eyther
excuse, or extenuate
this my relapse? shall
I pretend the slie subtelties
of the deuell;
the fair-faced shewes
of the worlde? the
pleasant perswasions
of the flesh? the woman
gaue it me, the serpente
deceined mee?
Tush, all these are
baites for babes; but
I was come to a greater
staiednesse, both
age, & in experience;
I was warned, I was

weapened; I was instructed,
I was encouraged; I shoulde
haue vsed more warines
to suspect, more
wisdom to discerne,
more valure, both to
defend my selfe, and
defeat mine enemie.
            Noe sure, I will
neuer excuse him
whome his owne
conscience condemneth:
I had thy expresse
word and will
to stop me; my owne
knowledge to bridle

mee; I would haue
disalowed those
thinges that I did, if
any other had done
them but my selfe.
When a mans memorie
is the bill of
his debt, when his
thoughts are willing
wytnesses agaynste
him, when his feare is
his goaler, when his
iudgment is his iudg,
when his owne
knowledg conuenteth
him, there is little
doubt either of

denying or deceiuing
credite, and
much lesse of making
escape.
            I, I, it is euen I
that haue broken couenant
with thee; I
haue abused my reason,
rather why to do
amisse, then howe to
amend; I haue falsified
my faith; I haue
riotously runne after
the vaine conceits or
rather deceits of sin;
whose kindest courtesies
are the allurementes

of mischeife;
which like a be-mired
dogge, defileth
with fawning; whose
kisses are of power
to kill.
            I haue receiued
manye freshe
woundes, I haue renued
all my oulde
soares, and what
thou (O Lorde) by
thy mercies haddest
healed, I by my
madnes haue rubbed
open; in soe much
as sinne vsed agayne,

hath made the pardone
once granted
to bee of none effect.
I may well say with
Iudas, I haue sinned;
but either name or
number my sinnes
I cannot.
            O bottomlesse sea
of miserie and sorrowe,
wherin I haue
plunged my selfe,
allwaies sinckinge, &
yet by the infinitnesse
thereof neuer at the
bottome; which I
am able, neither to abide▪
               
hauing the firebrandes
of all furies
within me, nor yet to
auoide, beeing fettered
therein with the
cruell chaines of my
owne feare.
            Oh my soule, full
of wretchednesse, ful
of shame, but fullest
of guiltines, accept
no obiect but of sorrowe;
drawe greedely
into thy minde all
conceites that maye
increase thy griefe:
bee ashamed, nay abhorre

to think of any
comforte. Loath thy
selfe, torment thy
selfe, and soe shall
thou doe some thing
well; for thou canst
neither loath nor torment
a more cursed
creature.
            Alas, howe is my
soule abandoned?
how are all the powers
thereof layd wast?
comforte is no more
ease vnto me, then is
the handlinge of sore
woundes. I am deuided

in my selfe, how
can I stand? I am
ouerthrowne in my
selfe, how shall I rise?
my desire is payned
because it cannot
hope, and if it hath
any sparke of hope, it
is rather in change
then riddance of
griefe.
            Forlorne wretch
that I am, it had bin
better for mee neuer
to haue bin conuerted
to grace, then
thus peruersly to bee

diuerted from the
same; for then I
should haue gon on
in a sober securitie,
and my punishment
should haue bin soe
much the lesse, as ignorance
is beneath
contempt: but nowe
I am not onely vnhappie,
but vnhappy
after the falle from
some degree of happinesse;
nowe the
footestepps of ouertroden
vertue laye
cruell accusations against

mee, and
make the hatefull
comparison of vice
more manifest, miserable
are they whoe
lose they wott not
what, but more miserable
are they
whoe knowe what
they lose.
            O foolish reason,
how sharpe art thou
to see thy mischiefe,
and yet how dimme,
how blinde art thou
to foresee it? O poore
remnant of pierie;

onely soe much
goodnes left, as to
make me languish in
my owne euell.
            O sinne, the onlye
fall of my iudgment
and staine of my
cōscience, now thou
hast sacked my soule,
now thou hast beaten
it downe vnder
thy tiranny, rest thy
selfe, forbeare a
while, treade not vpon
my ruins, set not
fire to thine owne
spoiles. And yet not

so; but do thy worst,
cruell and cursed
sinne, do euen the
verie worst that thou
canst: the more terrours
thou executest
vppon mee, the
more shall I both
loath and lament the
seruice that I haue
done thee; the sooner
shall I seeke to
drawe my desires
out of the mire of
thy subiection.
            There is yet left,
both time to repent,

and occasion to amend;
yet doeth
Christ, not only admit
but inuite to his
feast: I coulde neyther
see nor sorrowe
for my sinnes, did
not he both enlighten
my vnderstanding,
and soften my
sences. Hee hath
not enlightened my
vnderstandinge to
drowne it in darknes;
he hath not softned
my sences because
he could not breake

them; and why then
hath hee thus wakened
the one, and
weakened the other.
            It is euen soe: hee
that hath hetherto
in patience expected
mee, doeth now in
pittie call me. Speake
then (Lord) speake
vnto thy seruant;
thunder into the inner
eare of my harte;
breake my deafenesse
that I may heare
thy voice. Lorde,
thou lookest for

mine amendmente
that I may haue thy
fauour; and I looke
for thy fauour that I
may amende.
            Woe is mee, how
longe haue I staied?
Alas how late doe I
come? how slowlye
doe I hasten? howe
doeth my resolution
stick betweene loathnesse
and necessitie?
woe is me wretch,
how cunningly doth
the deuell seeke to
delay mee? what arte

hath he vsed to keepe
the line from breaking
wherat the fish
was caught? not
drawing him violently,
but letting him
play vpon the hooke
which hee soe greedely
had swallowed.
            O my God, the
sunne of my life hath
passed his Meridian,
and I am now in the
after noone of my
age; the night of nature
will come fast
vpon mee, when

death (as Gods sergeant)
will arrest, my
bodie vpon debt to
nature her selfe, my
soule vpon trespasse
committed against
God. The one hee
will binde hand and
foote, and committe
close prisoner to the
graue: the other he
will arraigne in the
high court of heauen,
where God
shall bee both partie
and iudge, to aunsweare
to all obiections,

as well of errour
as of contempt.
            At this houre of
death, when the sinnfull
soule beginneth
to bee loosed from
the fetters of flesh, O
good God, howe is
it troubled? what terrours
are presented
vnto it? Then beginneth
it to throwe the
thoughtes freely into
euery corner of
the conscience; to
see the sinnes which
it hath done; to perceiue

the vengeance
that it hath deserued;
to consider, that the
time of repentance is
then at an end, and
that it is set vpon the
immoueable pointe
of passage to a most
stricte triall, vncertaine
howe the best
actions that it hath
done shall bee examined.
            It is desirous to stay,
it is compelled to
goe: and as it often
happeneth, that

whilest one thinketh
too much of dooing,
he leaueth to doe the
effect of his thinking;
soe whilest it lamenteth
the losse of all
the time that is past,
it looseth that little
which then remaineth.
            Looking backe,
it esteemeth the
whole race which
it hath runne, as a
short steppe; looking
forward, it behouldeth
the infinite space

of eternytie wherin it
hath to continue; lifting
vp the minde to
heauen, it discouereth
a most bright &
beautifull glorie; againe,
castinge it
downe vpon the
earth, it seeth all
thinges enfoulded in
a mistie darknesse.
Heereupon, a new
swarme of thoughts
stingeth the minde;
It lamenteth, that it
was soe chained with
the enchauntmentes

of a momentanie estate,
as scarce to
thinke vpon the condition
which neuer
shall haue end; that to
satisfie the flesh,
which is to be a nest
of wormes, it hath
neglected the spirite,
which was to haue
bin a companion of
Angells; that it hath
lost, for soe short a
shewe, the eternall
substance of pleasure;
that it hath exchanged,
the treasure

of immortall
glorie for the trash of
floating vanitie.
            O, if it had but a smal
time more of amendment,
how seriously
would it conuerte?
what a sharpe and
seuere course would
it set into? but it is like
vnto a horse, desirous
to runne, & miserably
spurred, but
soe short reined that
hee cannot stirre: or
like vnto those who
in their dreames are

taken with some fearfull
vision, which
sweate with payne,
and striue to crie for
helpe, but cannot
finde any strength to
crie.
            In the meane
time, the head shooteth,
the back aketh,
the hart panteth, the
throate ruttleth, the
tongue faultreth, the
breath shortneth, the
flesh trembleth, the
veines beate, the hart
stringes crack; the

eyes wex dimme, the
nose sharpe, the
browes harde, the
cheekes colde and
wanne, the lippes
pale, the handes
numme, the iointes
stiffe; the whole bodie
is in a colde
sweat, the strength
fainting, the life vanished,
and death
drawing on. Neither
will the children and
friendes (for whose
sake the sick shall often
thinke them

selues damned) for
beare in this instant
of extremitie; but
continually like flesh
flies they will offer
molestation.
            Whilst these summoners
of death doe
execute their office,
all the wicked actions,
wordes and
thoughts are broght
into presence; they
are heaped together,
and aggrauated to
the vttermost; they
giue the conscience

many a colde pull,
and lie vpon the hart
as heavie as leade.
Faine would the sinner
turne away his
eye, but hee shall bee
compelled to behold
them; they will all
crie vnto him; wee
are thy workes, wee
will goe with thee.
            Then shall the
conscience sharplye
accuse, the memory
giue bitter euidence,
reason shall sit as
iudge, feare shall

stand as executioner;
and scarce is
there any seuere sentence
in all the bible
against sinne, which
the deuell will not
bring into minde,
vrging euery poynt
and amplifying it by
construction. Then
will resolution bee
turned to trembling,
pride into basenesse,
confidence into despaire.
Then will bee
a greate difference
in iudgment from

that which men
beare commonly in
this worlde, in soe
much as the sinner
shall be forced to cry
and confesse; we simple
men thought their
life to be but madnesse,
whose end wee now esteeme
most honourable:
but wee haue wearied
our selues in craggye
waies, wee are worne
out in pursuing vanity,
and the waies of the
Lorde wee haue not
knowne.
            
            
               
Neuer did tirant
exercise his rage
with greatet cruelty,
vpon anye that hee
most hated, then the
miserable sinner shall
then vpon him selfe;
in iustly condemninge,
in vainly acknowledging,
in vnprofitably
lamenting
the errours of his actions;
whilest the
paines of parting
shall drawe the
powers of the minde
from true repentance.

All vaine
pleasures are then at
an end, and as quite
forgotten as if they
had neuer bin at all.
Yea, euery wicked
delighte shall geue
sharp twitches to the
soule; especially whē
it considereth, that it
is to endure the smart
for manye thinges,
wherof it must leaue
the plesure to others.
            Somtimes the sinner,
more able to abide
death then the

feare of death, wisheth
to bee discharged,
from beeinge
guided by soe euell
a soule; not in full
hope that his tormentes
shall thereby
either end or abate;
but according to the
nature of greife, the
present being most
painfull, hee desireth
to chang, and to put
in aduenture the ensuing.
But when
he doth perceiue infinite
legions of deuells

prepared to receiue
him, and the
horrours of hell open
for his entertainment,
then is hee in
a maze of amazement;
then like one
that houldeth a
wolfe by the eare,
bitten whilest hee
holdeth, and slaine
when hee lett goe.
            Well then, (secure
and sencelesse
soule) howsoeuer
the deuell woulde
beare thee in hande,

as hee did thy first
parentes, that thou
shalt not die: yet
assure thy selfe this
heauie houre, this
fearfull, this dangerous,
this vnauoidable
passage is not
farre from thee, euen
in the fardest and fairest
course of nature;
and may bee euerye
houre, by many vsuall
accidentes, both
of violence and of
sicknesse. Thy continuance
is onely certaine

in vncertaintie;
and God would haue
the time vnknowne,
because thou shouldest
bee allwayes readie.
            Awake therfore,
and watch ouer thy
selfe; looke vpon the
pale horse, and him
that sitteth thereon,
whose name is
Death; prouide that
thou be not sodainely
surprised, and die
before thou beginne
to liue. Loose not

the offer of occasion,
whilest it may not
onely bee taken, but
offereth, yea sueth
to bee taken; and if
it be not now taken,
will neuer heereafter
be ouertaken.
            Christ yet distributeth
the treasures
of hys mercye, the
doore standeth yet
open, to all that will
bee suiters for the
same; his nature is
nowe as apte to forgeue,
as hys power

will be able hereafter
to punish. The kings
of Israell were not so
famous for heir mercy
among the seruauntes
of Abinadab,
as the God is among
vs. When thou didst
sinne, hee did spare;
when thou didst deferre,
he did expect;
when thou shalt returne
he will ēbrace.
The bowelles of his
mercie doe still ouerflowe,
neyther
wante their issues to

deriue the streames
thereof into thy
soule: his backe was
torne, hys handes
and feete were pierced,
hys side was
opened: throughe
these holes thou
maist see the aboundaunce
of his loue,
at these holy holes
thou maist taste the
sweetenesse of hys
mercy.
            Present thy selfe
therefore vnto him
in all those humble

behauiours, which
the consideration of
his maiestie and thy
miserie can possibly
frame; be penitent
for the time past, and
resolue for the time
to come; and with as
greate confidence as
necessitie crye vnto
him and say.
            O Christ, O eternall
light, O life of
all thinges, to whom
nothing is soe greate
that it can resist, nothinge
soe small that

it is contemptible;
whom no man is soe
good that he doth
not neede, noe man
soe euell that he may
not hope; I beseech
thee; by the nobl
                  •
               st
title that in my greatest
affliction I can
geue my selfe, that I
am thy creature; and
by thy onely name
of comfort vnto sinners,
that thou art
mercifull; heare my
vile voyce, helpe my
distressed soule, and

in the time of necessitie
and trouble bee
gra
                  •
               ious vnto me.
            Behold (O Lord)
howe my conscience
lyeth queasomed vnder
the multitude of
my offences; behold
how I am borne
downe wyth the
weight of my owne
weakenesse: and doe
not thou, whose propertie
is not onely
to spare, but to helpe,
eyther lighten the
burthen, or lay vnder

thy heauenlye
hand, my soule must
needes sincke downe
into hell.
            But thou (O Lord)
hast neither delight
nor likinge in the
death of sinners;
thou didst dy to raise
vs vp from the death
of sin. O good Iesu,
thou diddest redeeme
vs when wee
were thine enemies,
and shall wee bee
destroied now wee
are thy suppliantes?

thou diddest call vs
to mercie when wee
craued none, and
wilt thou denye vs
now we are suiters
for it? through thy
death wee were
brought vnto life,
and shall we dy now

                  •
               ue? O
thou whoe helpest
the weake wich a
worde, behoulde, I
come, I call, I looke
for thy mercie; hide
not thy face, stoppe
not thine eare, cast

mee not out of thy
regarde: let it suffice
that I feel mine own
weaknesse and want,
least I should haue
beene too proud in
my selfe; now let thy
power and plentye
appeare, that thereby
I may bee confident
in thee.
            O Christ, the
guide of those that
seeke thee, the light
of those that see thee,
and the life of those
that loue thee; O

sweete Sauiour,
what shall I say?
whether shall I goe?
where shall I seeke
thee? or wherefore
doe I not see thee? O
my God, if thou
bee absent from mee,
where shall I seeeke
thee? if in all places
thou art present,
wherefore doe I not
see thee?
            O infinite goodnesse,
passing all
humane both search
and sight, thou both

fillest and includest
all thinges; thou art
in euerie place present
without either
seate or motion; giue
mee grace for thy
loue and desires sake
I beeseech thee, to
cast off the blinde
burthen of fleshlye
affections; subdue
my reason, regenerate
my will, and purifie
my nature; lead
my desire that I may
seeke thee; lighten
my vnderstandinge

that I may see thee:
for I can neither
seeke thee without
thou direct mee, nor
see thee except thou
reueale thy selfe.
            Gracious God, I
haue noe goodnesse
in my selfe, but onely
to finde that I haue
no goodnesse like
a scholler, who is
come to that degree
of knowledge,
to knowe him selfe
vtterly ignorante:
but suffer (I beseech

thee) some beutifull
beame of thy maiestie
to shine into
my soule, disperse
the cloudes wherwith
my conscience
is ouercast, melt
the mistie darknesse
which couereth my
vnderstanding. O
thou who saydest
let there be light, and
light was made;
speake the worde and
my soule shall bee
enlightened, that I
may playnly see

thee, and perfectly
knowe thee, and ardently
both desire
and loue thee.
            O surpassinge
light, deliuer mee
from the shadow
both of ignorance
and errour, and consequently
from the
darkenesse of death;
swallow me vp in
the depth of thy
brightnesse; dazell
my eyes, that I maye
not bee able to see
any thing but thee;

possesse all my bodily
sences, that my
sinnefull affections,
or rather defections
may finde no place,
but that I maye soe
feele thee, that I
haue noe feelinge of
my selfe.
            O Lord of life, allthough
I am a sinner,
yet I am thy creature,
beecause thou
hast made mee, yea
and made me againe;
both by redeeming,
and by often renuing

mee: helpe mee
therefore whome
of thy goodnesse
thou hast fashioned,
let mee not perish
in my miserie whom
of thy mercie thou
hast redeemed, gouerne
mee heerafter
whome hetherto
thou hast preserued;
despise not (O Lord)
the worke of thine
owne handes. For
wherfore hast thou
created mee? beecause
thou wouldest

damne mee? It had
bin better for mee
neuer to haue bin
made, then to bee
confounded in my
owne corruption.
Listen (O Lord) to
the crie of thy poore
Orphane; cast mee
not off in thy displeasure,
and my
distresse; forsake mee
not, for thy sake, I
beeseech thee.
            And although
I haue in such sorte,
both defiled and defaced

this thy creature,
that thou
mayest iustly refuse
to take knowledge
of mee; yet by thy
mercies I pray thee,
wherein thou art
more wonderfull
then in all thy
workes, remoue the
one, and renue the
other; rubbe out
with thy bloode the
staines which sticke
in my soule and then
thou wilt knowe it,
to bee thy creature.
            
               
O Lord my God,
at whose presence
all powers doe shake,
at whose becke all
creatures obey, looke
fauourably vpon me
from thy glorious
seate; let thy maiestie
shine vnto mee
through thy mercie:
bee not angrye with
vs (wormish weak elinges)
although we
offend, for thou
knowest what wee
are, and whereof we
are made. Is not

man rottennesse? are
not his desires vanitie?
is not his life
miserie, and a verye
shadowe of death?
wilt thou shewe thy
strength against a
worme? against a
leafe? against a blast?
O thou who grantest
truce of life, there
are but twoe pleas
before thy throne,
either of innocencie,
or els of mercie: I
doe cleerely debarre
my selues of the one,

oh let my soule
runne into the armes
of the other.
            Haue mercie vpon
mee O gracious
God, haue mercy vpon
mee, a most wretched
creature; deale
not with mee according
to my desertes,
but according to
the greatnesse of thy
mercie, which is
infinitely more then
the sinnes of the
whole world.
            O almighty God,

from whose sight
there is noe couert,
and against whose
power ther is, neither
resistance nor
flight, looke not vppon
mee with thy
eie of iustice, drawe
not thy sworde of
vengence against
mee; but extend that
compassion, which
thou hast soe graciously,
soe deerelye
purchased for mee.
            I acknowledge indeede,
that amonge

all, and aboue all
sinners, I am wretched;
I acknowledge
also that I am vnable
to satisfie for my
sinnes: but (O
sonne of God) beehold
that in thy
selfe, which may
moue thee to haue
compassion vppon
mee. Soe often as
thou beehouldest the
woundes of thy
bruised bodie, soe
often let pittie pierce
thy harte: Soe often

as thou behouldest
the blessed streames
of thy bloode, wherof
one droppe had
bin sufficient for redemption
of the
whole worlde, soe
often couer my
sinnes, and recouer
mee.
            Forgiue my ignorance,
forget my
presumption, pardone
my iniquities,
relieue my necessities;
let my sinnes no
longer bee a cloude

betweene my prayer
and thy pittie, beetweene
thy goodnesse
and my distresse,
most gracious
God, who art mercifull
towardes all,
suffer not mee to bee
distitute of thy mercie:
for although I
haue committed
that whereby I maye
bee damned, yet hast
thou neither forgone,
nor forgotten
that wherby thou
art wout to saue.
            
               
O wretch that I
am, how coldly doe
I crie? how weakly
doe I craue? woe is
me wretch, how is
my harte hardened,
that mine eies doe
not poure forth plentie
of teares? how
sencelesse is my vncleane
soule, that
my flesh tremble not,
that my iointes doe
not shake vntill my
knees knocke together?
But wherefore
do I expostulate with
a dead carcase? Alasse,

I am nothinge but
vanitie; a rotten
roote, without anye
life of vertue; a barren
grounde, bringing
forth nothinge
but sinne, shame and
damnation: I am vnable,
either to giue
thee any thing but of
thine owne goodes;
or to doe any thinge
for my selfe, but by
thy free guifte.
            Wherefore, O
sweete sauiour, by
thy tender loue, and

by all thy mercies I
beeseech thee, giue
mee grace, that with
thy goodes and by
thy guiftes, I may
serue thee, and sorrowe
for my sinnes;
giue mee alsoe a
floude of teares in
token of thy fauour,
that I may sweetlye
poure them beefore
thy presence, with
greate reuerence and
feare, in bewailinge
mine offences, Mollifie
my stonie harte,

illuminate my mistie
minde, subdue my
flesh to my soule, my
soule vnto reason,
my reason to faith;
let mee ioie only in
enioyinge thee, in
whome, desire neuer
wanteth sacietie,
and sacietie neuer
breede dislike.
            Come thou into
mee, that I may remaine
in thee, shake
off these shackles, free
me from this weight
of fleshly affections

that leauing and loathing
all earthlye desires,
I may firmelye
resolue, speedely beginne,
and constantlye
continue, in dooinge
and sufferinge
thy holy will.
            Poure vpō my hart
the sweete stremes of
thy grace, that therby
my affectiōs may be
framed, to honour
thee as a Creator, to
loue thee as a redeemer,
to expect thee as
a Sauiour, & to feare

as a iudge. Let mee
allwaies bee humbled
beefore thee,
and neuer bee high
minded, but onelye
in mindinge thinges
on high.
            Write thy name
with thy owne finger
within the tables
of my breast, neuer
to be either shadowed
or worne out;
that I may continually
feede my hungry
ho
                  •
               es, with stedfast
remembrance

and regard of thee:
for firmly to remember,
& reuerently to
regard thee, is our
mortall manner both
of holdinge and beeholding
thee.
            Let the firie force of
thy loue swallow vp
my soule, that being
altogether possessed
therwith, it may neither
feele, nor desire,
nor once thinke vpō
any erthly thing; but
bee alwaies and onely,
not onelye ioined

but vnited to thee:
for as thy goodnesse
towardes vs is vnmeasurable
and infinite
soe wee are
bound to loue thee
without either measure
or end.
            Lorde, my whole
desire is before thee,
and my thoughtes
are not secret from
thy sight; turne not
thy countenance
from my complaint;
heare mee, O my
God, and grant my

petion; grant my petion,
that thou mayst
heare mee.
            Reach mee thy
helping hande, draw
my soule out of the
mire of sinne wherin
it is fast set, that I perish
not in the presence
of thy pittie.
Deliuer mee frō the
snares that th' enemy
hath laid, to take the
souls of sinners ether
willfull, or secure;
cutt away occsions
of euell beefore mee;

guide mee vnto
thee the streightest
course; and soe long
as I am to continue
in this vile vale of
miserie, settle mee in
that state of life
wherein I may best
please thee and pleasure
others.
            Giue mee grace,
O gracious God,
that although I haue
hetherto had noe
care to liue well, yet
nowe I may wholly
and holyly bend my

care to die well; that
from henceforth I
may liue in thy feare,
die in thy fauour,
rest in thy peace, rise
in thy power, and
remaine in thy ioie.
Amen.

               A Thankesgiuing, intermixt
with confession
and prayer,
            
            
               O Lorde Iesus,
infinite
in pitie,
infinite
in power, infiite allsoe
both in thy rewards,
and in thy reuenge:
I am weakly

(thou knowest) rather
willing then desirous,
with my soule
to loue thee, with
my flesh to feare
thee, with my minde
to honor thee, with
my mouth to praise
thee, with my whole
substance to serue
thee, to commend
my whole substance
vnto thy protection.
But alas, I am soe
clogged with corruption,
I am soe
drowned in flesh

and bloud, that I
scarce either dare or
can lif
                  •
                vp my head,
and looke vnto thee:
and yet why should
I bee ashamed when
thou doest inuite
mee? why should I
bee faint when thou
doest not onely incourage,
but alsoe
enable mee, or at the
least accept my
weake endeuour?
            Striue then, O
the verie bowels of
my soule, striue with

all your strength to
raise your thoughtes,
out of this mire of
mortallitie wherein
they sticke, out of
these waues of fleshly
affections wherein
they floate, without
either firme footinge
or certaine drift. Aduance
thy selfe towardes
thy creator,
Frame thy affections,
to loue him for
his goodnes, to honour
him for greatnes,
to reioice in him

for his merites, to
pray vnto him for
his mercies, which
daylye thou doest
neede, and by needing
doest craue, and
by crauing doest
obtaine; if not according
to thy desires,
yet verye farre aboue
thy deserts.
            O Lord, I confesse
vnto thee, that
my harte is vncleane,
and that I am a man
of polluted lippes;
wallowing in the

dunge, and stinkinge
in the rottennesse of
my owne sinne: soe
that I may iustlye
tremble to appeare
before thy glorious
presence, much more
to present vnto thee
thy pure prayses out
of my defiled mouth.
But who except
thou (O Lorde) can
make mee cleane,
and what is pure
which thou hast not
purged?
            Thee therefore, O

Father of life, O
Lord of light, thee
with all the forces of
my soule, thee most
humbly, most earnestly
I do beseech;
heare O mercifull,
helpe O myghtye
Lord, helpe thy seruant
whome of thy
mercie thou hast
created: clense my
filthynes, lighten
my darknes, enflame
my coldenes, quicken
my dulnes, awake
my drowsines,

reuiue my deadnes;
repaire the ruines of
my soule, enlarge
the frame of the vnderstanding
thereof,
clense it from all
earthly corruption,
garnish it with thy
heauenly graces, that
it may bee conueniently
both fitt and
furnished to receiue
thee; that thou maist
make thine entrie, &
possesse that which is
thine owne, both by
creation, & also by redemption;

and that
as thou art exalted aboue
all creatures,
soe aboue all creatures
I may honour
thee, loue thee, and
praise thee; not with
that affection wherewith
my weakenesse
is able, either to doe
or to desier; but
with that perfection
wherewith in dutie
I should, and wherewith
thy Saintes and
angells indeede doe.
            O giuer of life, O

restorer, O preseruer,
O enlightner of
life; O most louinge
and louely Lorde.
But what shall I say?
where shall I finde
full praises to extoll
thee? my speach faltreth,
and my spirit
faileth; my tongue
can applie no fitting
wordes, neither can
my minde supplye
sufficient matter: I
want wordes to expresse
my minde, I
want alsoe a minde

to apprehende thy
merites: I conceiue
farre aboue the abilitie
of my vtterance,
and yet farre vnder
the dignitie of thy
desertes.
            Lord, my soule is
desirous to yeelde
praises to thee for thy
benefites, but it is vnable
to conceiue
that which is worthy,
and vnwilling to
vtter that which is
vnworthy; it is ashamed
to sende forth

woordes, knowinge
how weake they are
for soe weightie an
office. without thy
presence it can neuer
attaine to any degree
of thy praise: let it
therefore haue thee
(O Lorde) that it
may in some measure
praise thee.
            For what worthy
praise can I giue vnto
thee, by whose
goodnes I was created,
by whole mercie
I was redeemed,

by whose power I
am preserued, and by
whose grace I looke
to bee glorified?
when I was not,
thou diddest make
mee; when I was
lost and forlorne,
thou camest downe,
and tookest mortallitie
vpon thee to
redeeme mee: thou
a King, diddest humble
thy selfe to exalt
mee; thou wert sould
to redeem mee; thou
wert wounded to

heale mee; and thou
diddest dye to saue
mee.
            O sonne of God,
how hast thou abased
thy selfe? how were
thy affections inflamed?
how large were
the limits of thy mercie?
Lorde, thou hast
loued mee more
then thy selfe, beecause
for my sake
thou wouldest endure,
not onely a
contemptible life,
but both a shamefull

and painfull death.
            And yet did not
thy loue in this sorte
leaue mee, but thou
hast continuallye soe
followed mee with
thy fauours, as
though thou haddest
regarded mee alone,
and neglected all thy
other creatures.
            When I wandred
thou diddest
seeke mee, when I
was ignorant thou
diddest instruct mee,
when I offended

thou diddest correct
mee, when I sorrowed
thou diddest comforte
mee, when I
stumbled thou diddest
stay mee, when
I fell thou diddest
raise mee, when I
stoode thou diddest
strengthen mee; in
my affaires thou diddest
direct mee, in
my troubles thou
diddest helpe mee,
in my dangers thou
diddest deliuer mee;
waking thou diddest

inlighten mee, sleeping
thou diddest
watch mee, sinninge
thou diddest suffer
mee, and prayinge
thou diddest heare
mee. Further, thou
hast annointed mee
with thy holy spirit,
and giuen mee a
minde to follow
thee; thou hast called
mee by thine owne
name, and thou hast
sealed mee with thy
bloude vnto eternall
life.
            
               
These and manye
other benefites haue
I receiued, some in
hand, and some in
hope; although
through my owne
sinnefull demeanor, I
haue almost both let
go my hold, and lost
my hope. But
what? if by my owne
fault I haue lost these
graces, shall I bee
vnthankefull to him,
by whose fauoure
once I had them.
            Lorde, I can

yealde noe reason
wherefore I had
them but that thou
wert mercifull; ney▪
can I say any thinge
nowe I haue soe
neere lost them, but
that thou art iust:
& therefore I thanke
thee beecause thou
diddest giue mee
them, I am sorie beecause
I haue noe better
kept them, and
I pray thee that thou
wouldest againe fully
restore them. For

I assure my selfe,
that thy goodnes is
as willinge to restore
as it was to giue; and
that my weakensse is
as able to recouer as
it was to receiue.
            Therefore, O
Lorde Iesus, by thy
precious teares, by
thy blessed bloude
which thou diddest
shedd for my redemption,
by the aboundance
of thy
mercies I most humbly
beeseech thee,

saue thy seruant, saue
one of thy members,
though poore and
feeble; saue, I saye, a
part of thy selfe. Be
as greate in pardoning
those that are
submitted vnto thee,
as in punishing those
that are rebellious:
poure vpon my heart
the sweete streames
of thy mercies; conforme
my life, confirme
my faith, settle
mee in a right and
vpright course, and

contynue mee in
the same euen vnto
the end.
            The worlde (O
Lorde) is wrapped
in darkenesse, whereby
it is made subiect,
both to the pollicies
and power of our
most dangerous and
deadly enemy: who
beeing the prince of
darkenes, is thereby
become alsoe the
prince of the worlde:
but by thy light his
malice is discouered,

by thy wisdome his
deceites are auoided,
and by thy strength
his power is repelled.
Hee hath manye and
verye greate thinges
(I confesse) to laye
vnto my charge, but
for thy names sake
(O Lorde) rebuke
him, and deliuer me.
Drawe my desires
aboue the pitch of
his darkenesse, raise
my soule out of this
myrie lake of misery,
which affoordeth

nothing, but eyther
daungers or discontentmentes;
that this
filthy lumpe of flesh
onely may abide
on earth, but my
thoughtes may continually
attend vpon
thee.
            O sweete Iesus,
the way of health,
the gate of life, the
pallace of pietie, of
ioy, of safetie; I doe
too much depresse
thy benefites whilest
I labour to expresse

them: for they haue
not onely filled,
but ouerflowed the
frame of the worlde.
But, O thou who vnfealest
the silence of
the dumbe, vntie my
tongue, that I may
declare thy goodnes,
and giue my voice a
power to praise thee
for the same.
            By thee (O Lord)
the exile is reduced,
the captiue redemed,
the sinner is iustified,
the sicke are healed,

the dead are raised,
and the damned are
saued. By thy goodnesse
wee are created,
by thy power
wee are preserued,
by thy mercye wee
are saued. Thou
diddest create vs
without any neede,
thou doest gouerne
vs without any labour,
thou mayest
destroie vs without
any losse. Thou hast
giuen all thinges vnder
heauen for our

vse, either necessarye
or conuenient; and
yet diddest thou not
thinke that enough,
but thou hast allsoe
appointed thine angells
to attend vpon
vs, to stande aboute
vs, to watch ouer vs,
to bee messengers
for our seruice beetweene
thee and vs.
            And not onelye
mankinde hast thou
exceedinglye both
honoured and enriched
with thy blessinges,

but the heauens,
the starres, the
earth, the aire, the
seas, the floudes, the
day, the night, and
whatsoeuer else thou
hast ordained, either
for the necessitie or
delight of man, are
by thee renued, and
restored to the end
for which they were
created. For all
thinges were made
for the seruice of
man, and man for
the seruice of God:

but once they serued
those who serued idoles,
and then they
were without anie
dignitie, then in a
verie kinde of death,
being diuerted from
the right vse of their
creation. But now
they are exalted, now
reuiued, now they
reioice to serue
those, who serue and
worship thee, O
Lorde.
            But why doe I
confine thy benefites

within the compasse
of the whole worlde?
They haue prepared
downe into hell;
they haue alsoe surmounted
aboue the
heauens. Thou hast
subdued the kingdome
of Sathan;
thou hast broken the
chaines of darkenesse
and death; thou hast
loosed the captiuitie
of hell. By thee alsoe
the angells expect a
restitution of the
breach which was

made amongst them,
by reuolt of those
which fell.
            O singular grace,
O admirable goodnesse,
whereby mankinde
is saued; the
elementes are renued
hell is vanquished;
and heauen
is repaired. O beutifull,
O bountifull
Iesu, thou hast blessed
al creatures, & all
creatures againe doe
blesse & praise thee:
by thy holinesse they

are blessed, by thy
happinesse they reioice,
by thy fullnesse
they flourish.
            O holy, O happie,
O high Iesu, how is
my dull sight dazelled
with thy exceeding
brightnesse? My
affections laboure
to attaine vnto thee,
but whether, I pray
thee, doest thou flie
the pursuite of my
vnderstanding? How
exceedest thou the
compasse of my conceite?

Tarry O Lord,
tarrie a while for my
feeble feete, which
straine to followe
thee: hide not thy
selfe from my dim
eies, which seeke to
see thee: haue pittie
vppon my weake
soule, which wearily
panteth after the sauour
of thy saluation.
Reach forth thine
heauenly hand; leade
mee Lorde, lighten
mee Lorde, let mee
put the finger of my

faith into thy
woundes; let mee
looke a little how
thou hast loued
mee.
            Oh wonder of
wisdome, O miracle
of mercie: God
made all thinges,
and God was made
man: God made all-thinges
of nothinge,
and without man all-thinges
had turned
to nothinge: God
made all thinges of
him selfe, but God

would not restore
all thinges without
man. Hee was beegotten
of God by
whome all thinges
were made, hee was
borne of a woman
by whom all thinges
were renued: he was
beegotten of God
with out whome
there was nothinge,
hee was borne of a
woman without
whome nothing was
well.
            O Christ, perfect

God, and perfect
man; O sweete safetie,
O secure ioye;
howe wonderfull,
how worthy a matter,
how weightie is
it which I doe beehoulde?
I am much
delighted to see it,
and yet I scarce dare
vtter it. Let my sences
bee silent for a
time, let the tumultuous
cogitations of
my minde bee quiet;
reason cannot
shewe her selfe more

reasonable, then to
leaue resoning in
matters aboue her
reach. What was
hee made? and what
hath hee made vs?
Shall I speake with
ioie, or with modestie
houlde my peace?
But that which my
hearte doth beelieue
with loue, shall not
my mouth confesse
with praise? I w
                  •
               ll
speake therefore, not
with an high, but
with an humble spirite;

not to glorie in
my selfe, but to glorifie
God.
            The Sonne of
God was made man,
to make men the
sonnes of God. If
then hee hath made
vs the sonnes of his
father, hee hath therby
made him selfe
our brother▪ therfore,
our intercessor
is our brother, our
iudge is our brother,
our Sauiour is our
brother, our God is

our brother. With
what assurance then
may wee hope? what
feare shall inforce vs
either to dispaire or
to doubt? seeing our
saluation dependeth
vpon the will of our
most louing brother?
With what securitie
may wee flie vnto
him? with what
bouldnesse may wee
embrace him? with
what confidence may
wee intreate him?
Our louinge brother

will giue vnto vs the
good which wee do
desire, and forgiue vs
the euell which wee
doe deserue; hee will
aske for vs, hee will
obtaine for vs, whatsoeuer
is expedient:
the sonne wil entreat
the father for his children,
and the father
will heare the sonne
for his brethren.
            Let the diuell
then doe his worst to
dismay mee; let my
foolish feare murmur

as much as it will;
let them both vrge
theyre abiect obiections,
and saye;
who art thou? howe
greate are thy sinnes?
and where (in
Gods name) are thy
demerites? I will answere
with assurance,
I knowe what
I am my felfe; and I
knowe who hee is
vnto whome I trust
Hee hath giuen mee
his gracious worde,

who is both in promise
true and mightie
in performance;
hee will doe what he
can for my safetie,
and can doe whatsoeuer
hee will. When
I call to my consideration
the inestimable
both bent of his
loue, and treasure of
his mercie, then may
I plainly both see and
say, as the seruant of
the prophette did
when his eies were

opened: they are
more that stande for
vs, then they who are
against vs. 2. Reg. 6. 15.
The multitude of
my sinnes shall neuer
choake his loue;
I can want noe merites
soe longe as hee
doeth want noe mercies:
If his loue bee
greate, my sinnes are
but small; and if
greate bee his mercies,
greate likewise
shall bee my merites.
            
               
He hath registred
mee on his backe; he
hath engrauen me in
his handes, hee hath
sealed me on his side;
the whippes, the
nailes, the speare
haue surely signed
his loue vnto mee:
they proclaime his
mercie to bee
claimed of all men;
they crie comfortably
vnto mee, that I
neede not feare.
            Hee hath displaied

his blessed bodie
abroade vpon the
crosse, his armes
spreade to imbrace
mee, his heade bowed
downe to kisse
mee, his hearte laide
open to loue mee▪
Into those armes of
my Sauiour will I
runne, beetweene
these armes will I
rest, beetweene these
armes will I reioice. I
will sprinckle my
heart with the bloud

of this lambe, and
the destroyer shall
haue noe power to
hurte.
            
               My sinnes greater
then can bee forgiuen?
Thou liest, Caine;
our sinnes can stande
in noe degree of
comparison with the
mercies of God; but
soe farre as God is
greater then man,
soe much doeth the
goodnesse of the one
exceede the euell of

the other. As the
nature of God is infinite
and vnmeasurable,
soe cannot his
loue bee limitted, soe
is there noe measure
of his mercie; as the
nature, soe the goodnesse
of God is
knowne only to him
selfe.
            The sonne of God
hath taken our substance
vpon him, hee
hath exalted it aboue
the heauens, he hath

seated it in the kingdome
and glorie of
his father: In him I
haue a portion of
flesh aud bloud, in
him a parte of my
selfe euen now doth
reigne, in him a part
of my selfe is alreadie
glorified: and as
I doe nothing doubt
of this his communion
with mee in nature,
soe will I not
distrust of my participation,
both heere

of his grace, and
heereafter of his glorie;
for although I
am sinnefull, yet is
not hee soe vnnaturall,
that either hee
can forgette, or will
forsake his owne mē
               bers.
            Hee that dispaireth
or distrusteth his
owne safetie, hee denieth
Christes mercie:
and consequently,
hee denieth his
loue, hee denieth

his truth, hee denieth
his power; the
loue of his passion,
the truth of his promise,
and the power
of his ascention.
Therefore, the more
willinge hee was to
suffer, and the more
able hee is to saue,
the lesse cause haue I
to feare; for when all
thinges shall faile, he
will most constantly
keepe his faith.
            O wonderfull

misterie, O exceeding
mercie, euer to
bee admired, euer to
bee loued: wee were
not worthye to bee
seruantes, and loe we
are made the sonnes
of God; yea the
heires of God, and
fellowe heires with
Iesus Christ. Who
but must bee amased
at such bowelles
of mercie? who but
will reioice at such
aboundance of loue?

which when I call
to my consideration,
the burthen of my
flesh doeth not so
presse me, the weight
of my mortalitie and
miseries are not soe
grieuous as they
were wont.
            Gracious Lorde,
what thankes, what
praise shall I tender
to thee for this adoption?
where shall I
get good wordes to
set forth this thy

good will? Surely, if
I had the tongue and
knowledge of Angells,
yet could I neither
thanke thee, nor
thinke of thee as is it
meete. For thy exceeding
loue, proceding
from thy meere
goodnesse, reacheth
beyond all boundes,
both of vtterance
and vnderstandinge:
thy praise, Oh Lord;
is incomprehensible;
and then wee doe

most praise thee,
when wee knowe
thee to bee thine
owne praise, and acknowledg
our selues
vnable to praise
thee.
            But, O sweete Sauiour,
whome none
seeketh but the admonished,
none findeth
but the guided,
I beeseech thee by
thine inestimable
goodnesse, let mee
not bee vnthankfully

silent for these thy
benefits teach me secretly
in my hearte,
O my God, teach
mee thy humble seruant,
O mercifull
God, euen by thy
greate mercies, I beseech
thee, teach my
hearte, with what reuerence
it shoulde
thinke of thee; tell
my soule, with what
delight it shoulde
loue thee; giue my
tongue some power

to poure forth praises
vnto thee: correct my
weakenesse, erect my
hope, direct my desires:
finish the work
that thou hast beegunne,
and bringe
mee to the fullnesse
of thy mercie.
            I was dead and
buried in sinne, I
shoulde haue rotted
in distruction, but
thou diddest raise
mee, thou diddest
reuiue mee, by thy

loue I liue: a
                  •
               d therfore
I offer my selfe
wholly vnto thee,
most earnestlye entreating
thy gracious
acceptance, that wee
may loue and liue
together.
            O Lorde Iesus, I
bowe the necke of my soule vnder the
feete of thy maiestie,
and in the lowest degree
of reuerence,
doe giue thee most
humble and hartie

thankes for these thy
benefites: I yeelde
thee praise (O
Lorde) although
base and bare, and
farre vnanswerable
to thy desertes: yet
something my weaknesse
is bounde to
performe; namelye,
to settle my minde to
beeholde and loue
thee, and to praise
thee with wordes soe
well as I can.
            O amiable, O admirable

Iesu, let mee
loue thee allwaies,
because thou diddest
loue mee firste:
let mee loue thee onlye,
for hee loueth
thee too little, that
loueth any thing besides
thee, except it
bee for thy sake; allwaies
and onely let
mee loue thee, beecause
by thee onelye
I shall alwaies liue.
            O that my hearte
did so languish with

thy loue, that it
might melt the moysture
of my bodie into
teares, oh that the
bowells of my soule
were soe enflamed
with thy loue, that it
might consume all
drossie desires, and
drie vp the verie marrowe
of my bones:
oh that I were sicke
for the loue of him,
whoe died for the
loue of mee.
            Lorde, allthough

I bee not worthy soe
to loue thee, yet art
thou worthy much
more to bee loued.
Therefore (O louing
Iesu) doe not soe denie
mee that wherof
I acknowledge my
selfe vnworthy, that
thy selfe be depriued
of that, wherof thou
art most worthye.
Graunt (O Lorde)
graunt I beeseech
thee, not for my desertes,
but for thy

mercies sake, graūt to
my soule, that it may
loue thee as thou hast
deserued. Grannt (I
say) that I may bee
worthy to giue that,
which thou art worthy
to receiue: soe
shall I bee worthy of
that, whereof nowe I
am vnworthy.
            It is verie much
(O Lorde) that I
doe desire, beeinge
alltogether vnworthy
to speake vnto

thee; but thy bountie
hath made mee bold;
I will speake therefore
againe vnto my
Lorde, although I
bee but dust and
ashes: I will speake
againe vnto him,
who hath not onelye
licensed, but prouoked,
but commaunded
vs that we should
aske.
            O Lord our God,
O gracious, O allmightie
God, is it

not better that thou
shouldest freelye
giue mee that which
I haue not deserued,
then that I shoulde
vnthankefullye not
yeelde to thee, that
which is thy due?
the one woulde bee
a propertie of thy
mercie, the other an
effect of my iniustice.
Giue therefore
vnto mee thy grace,
that I may returne
vnto thee thy due;

bestow vpon mee
thy mercies, that I
may commit against
thee noe iniustice;
bee liberall vnto me,
that I may not seeme
iniurious to thee,
giue (O Lorde,) giue
vnto my soule aboundance
of thy
loue, which I doe
iustlye desire, that I
may not be vnthankfull
vnto thee, which
thou mayest iustlye
punish.
            
               
Deare Christ, I
doe feele in my heart
a weake warmnesse
of thy loue, but my
prayer is, that the
coales were throughly
kindled with desire,
and blowne with
delight into a full
flame. O sacred fire,
how comfortablye
doest thou burne? O
heauenlye lighte,
how sweetlye doest
thou shine? how desirous
are they more

and more to burne
whom thou dost enflame?
how are they
delighted whome
thou doest enlightten?
            Alasse, how late
haue I loued thee, O
beautie most exceedinglye
both auncient
and fresh, and
yet, alasse, how little
do I loue thee? wherfore
I beeseech thee,
O Lorde, by thy precious
woundes, from

which gushed out
the streames of our
redemption, wound
my sinnefull soule
with the dart of thy
loue, strike Lorde,
strike with the two
edged sworde which
procedeth out of thy
mouth, strike deepe
into my harde harte,
pierce my sencelesse
soule, parte all the inner
partes of my spirit,
that I may crie
out, (but not complaine)

how I am
wounded with thy
loue.
            O sweete Christ
O good Iesu, euen
for thine intercession
sake, and for thy merites
sake I beeseech
thee, giue me thy holy
and chast loue, and
then shall I bee fullye
furnished with all
heauenly ver
                  •
               ues.
Lorde, thou diddest
loue vs when wee
were thine enemies,

and wilt thou denie
vs now to loue thee
againe? thou hast
commaunded vs
with our whole harte
to loue thee; and wilt
thou not graunt vs
abilitie to obey.
            Heare O my God,
heare O light of mine
eies, encrease my desire,
and grant my request;
stop not thime
eares against mee,
beecause of my
sinnes. Indue my

soule with thy loue,
subdue my flesh with
thy feare, that I may
allwaies thinke of
thee ioyntlye both
with tremblinge and
trust. Settle the loue
of thee in mee, and
the care of mee in
thee: let my prayer
come vnto thee, and
thy mercie come vnto
mee; let the ioy of
thy happinesse remaine
with mee, and
the cōpassion of my

miseries remaine
with thee. Let my
hearte loue thee, let
my flesh feare thee,
let my whole substance
in this worlde
ioie whollye in thee,
that it may enioye
thee wholye in the
worlde to come.
Amen.
