herte that his loue was not wellykline
cordable. For he was not of ſo highe
lygnage as the noble maydē viēne

And the fayre vyenne ꝑceyued
not that parys was amerous of hyr
Nor parys alſo durſt neyther ſhewe

more that he ſawe hyr. the more grewe

of Dyenne.
               
                  
                  WHan the Daulphin vnderſtode

ſholde knowe what they were that
ſoo ſāge euery nyght before hyr chā

Wherfore he ordeyned. x. men̄ of

Now came the night that the

that was layed: for them
came with their inſtrumētes toward
the caſtel and there they began to ſinge

began to pulle onte theyr ſwerdes &
came ayenſt the two yoge knyghtes
that naked were frō alle armes ſauf
theyr ſwerdes and theyr bowclers.
Wherwyth they couerd them: and ſo
manfully deffēded their bodyes that
they hurte and 
                  wounded fore al the
ten armed men̄ / ī ſo moch that they
maad them all to voyde and flee fro
the place whether they wolde or not
ād on the morowe erly the ten men
of armes came to fore the daulphyn
alle wounded 
                  and fore hurt / And
they recōpted to him how two yonge
men onely had 
                  arayed them ſo &
how they nedes muſt flee for fere of
their liues. Wherof the daulphi was
right angry to ſee thē ſo ſore hurt ād
took grete diſplayſir of it. ād thought
wel that the ſayd two yōge knightes

folowyng yf they came ageyn chargyng
that none hurte ſholde be doō
to thē: but after their ſonge doon they
ſhold be brought vnto him. but this
ēterpryſe came to none effect. for the
two yonge knightes came not ageyn

but kepte alle that they had doon ſecrete / 
Whā the fayr viēne ſawe that
ſhe might not knowe we what theſe miſtrellys
were: ſhe thought that they
were ſomme grete lordes that were
anterous of hyr: & ſhe ād hyr damoiſely

plaiſir to talke of them: Parys ſeyng
he durſt not ſaye nor ſhewe the
grete loue that he had to the fayr vyenne / 
thought he wold hyde his courage
from hyr / wherfore he took acqueyntaūce
with the biſſhop of ſaint
Laurēce. the whiche lerned hym holy
ſcrypture. The daulphyn thēue ſeyng
his doughter full tryſte and penſyful
for this that ſhe might not knowe

played to fore hyr chābre. he
ordeyned a jouſtyng place wyth ī his

And parys made coūtenaunce

he ſo moch loued in his herte ſecretly
            
            
               ¶ How Dyane and vyenne hyr
doughter wenten to vyſite the fader
of Parys / the whyche was ſeek
               
                  
                  
NOw it happened that durig
this tyme that Parys & Edward
                  duelled in Braband:
the fader of parys fyl in to a ſekeneſſe
of feures or acceſſe. And the cauſe came
of the thought that he had of hys
ſone parys And he beyng ſeek / the
daulphyn wente on a day to ſee him
and 
                  demaūded the cauſe of his maladye.
and 
                  cōforted him the beſt wiſe
that he coude. and after retorned

was ād laye / Dame dyane demaū
                  ded

and ſayd that hys ſone was moche

wel belould of the daulphyn / & that
he had moch grete amytye of many
grete lordes barons and knightes. &
alſoo ſhe ſayd that among alle thynges

after al thys: the moder of paris prayed
hyr that it might plaiſe hyr to come
ſee the caſtell: and ſhe anſwerd
that ſhe moche deſired it / Then̄e the
moder of paris ſhewed hyr al the caſtel
& ledde hyr into an halle all ful of
armes and abylemēts of warre / for
to fight in bataill. After ſhe ladde hir
ito an other hall where as were many
hawkes / faulcons & many other
fowles of chace. and after in to many
other halles & chābres rychely arayed
which were ouer longe to reherce:
And after the moder of paris
ſhewed vnto hyr the chābre of paris
where that he ſlepte. Wherin were
many habillemēts / which ſhold wel
ſuffyce the chābre of a grete prīce / ād
in the ſayde chābre were twoo grete
ſtādardes couerd after the guyſe of
fraunce. That one was full of clothe
of goolde & ſylke: & that other of harnoys
& of other many thīges. Then̄
ſayde vyēne to yſabeau / bi my fayth
fayre ſyſter I haue no grete meruaile
of this yōge knyght paris though
of him be maade grete mēcyon For
thordynnan̄ce of thiſe thinges ſhewe
wel that he is of grete valure. and in
beholdyng of theſe thinges ſhe ſawe
acouerture of an hors alle whyte: &
hyr ſemed that it was the ſame that
the knyght bare that wāne the prys
of the iouſtes that was made in the
cyte of Dyenne / and that had the
ſhelde of cryſtal: & the garlond whyche
ſhe tolde to yſabeeu. & yſabeau āſwerd
to hyr / neuer thinke ye ſoo / for
alle day been made ſemblable couertures
ād tokenes whyte: wherof ye
may wel be deceyued. And Dyenne
enforced alle waye hyr ſelff to take
better hede. and of the grete ioye that
ſhe had ſhe ſayd to hir moder Madame
I am a lytil craſed & ſodaynli taken.
Wherfore if it playſe you i wold
fayne reſte a lytel in this chambre: &
late me be alle allone wyth my ſyſter
yſabeau / For I wil haue none other
and anone eche body auoyded owte
of the chambre: & yſabeu dyd ſhytte
the dore that none might come in.
               Then̄e ſayd vyenne: now / we ſhall
ſee yf we may fynde ony thinge that
we may haue better knowleche of
for myn / herte ſayth yes / After that
they had 
                  ſerched 
                  and 
                  vyſyted alle
the chambre: they cam on a ſyde of
the chambre where they fonde a lytel
dore: of whiche henge a lytel keye
by a th̄ wāge / and anone they opened
the dore and 
                  entred therin / And
there was a lytel chambre whyche
was xij. foot longe. ād was an oratorye.
Where as was the mageſte of
our Lord Iheſu cryſt vpon a lytell
aulter. & at eche corner was a cādel / 
ſtyke of ſiluer / ād thyder cam parys
for to make hys ſacrefyce whan he
aroos / & whan he wēte to his bedde.

                  And there were the thre baners that
the noble knyght parys had wonne
in the cyte of Parys / and the thre jewellys
of the thre damoyſelles afore
ſayde And in the ſame place was alſo
the ſheld of Cryſtal & the garlond
that Vyēne delyuerd to him: whā he
wanne the prys at the iouſtes in cyte
of Vyenne / And alle theſe he kepte
ſecrete in that place / And whā vienne
ſawe theſe thinges. ſhe was ſure
that parys was he whom̄ ſhe had
ſo moche deſired to knowe: & that ſo
moche honour had doon to hyr. and
for the grete ioye that ſhe had. ſhe ſette
hyr doū on the groūde. & there abode
a grete whyle & coude not ſpeke a
word ād after ſhe ſpake to Iſabeau
and fayde. My ſwete ſyſter / bleſſyd
and preyſed be our lord of this good
yourney. For me thīketh I ſhold neuer
departe oute of thys chambre. A
alas I haue ſo lōge abyden to knowe
who he was that ſo ſwetely played
in his inſtrumētes ſo nygh vnto me
and now he is ſo ferre. & then̄e yſabeau
began to repreue hyr ād ſaid to
hyr. Swete lady I praye you that ye
ſay ne do ony thīg which might torne
you to folye / & be ye ruled by wiſedom
& reaſon For notwithſtōdyng
that parys haue ſo moche good and
vertues. yet ye ought to cōſyder that
he is not egal to you in lygnage ne in
eſtate / For i knowe wel that many
noble & puyſſaūt lordes haue demaū
                  ded
you in mariage: & loue you ād do
grete tginges for you. & alſo thonour
of parys whiche is your vayſſal ād
ſubget is not egall ue worthy vnto
you / ¶ Then̄e vyēne was moch angry
on yſabeau / & began to ſay: A veray
god I am well diſcomforted by
the. that thus agayn ſayeſt me of hī / 
that I ſo longe haue deſyred to knowe:
Alas I haue ſuppoſed that in nothing
ye wold haue diſplayſed me:
ād in good fayth I ſayde to the that
this man I wil loue and demaunde
and I ꝓmyſe the in good faith that
yf thon ony more gaynſaye me i ſhall
flee my ſelf / and thenne thou ſhalt be
cauſe of my deth / For I wil not leſe
him that I haue ſo lōge loued But I
ſay to the for trouth that if thou euer
ſay to me ſuche wordes of my frende
paris. that thou ſhalt neuer after haue
ſpace to ſay them ageyn an other
time: for thou conſidereſt wel his noble
cōdicyōs & acuſtomes / thou ſholdeſt
preyſe hym better thā thou dooſt
& knoweſt not thou wel that the kīg
of fraūce wold that it had coſte hym
half hys toyaume that hys ſone Lowys
were as vayliaūte as parys is
And alſo there be many notable lordes
that deſyre to knowe his name / 
and to haue hys amytye
               Then̄e take hede and byholde by my
fayth: yf euer thou ſawe man that
myght be compared to him. certaynly
alle vertues been in hym / and ſythe
that fortune hath brought me to
hys loue / he is worthy to haue my
loue. and yet more than is in me / ād
haue I not reaſon and cauſe thenne

to loue him / whiche hath doon to me
ſo grete good & honour. & doubtyng
noo peryl of his ꝑſone. & is it not well
grete worſhyp to my fader / to haue
for vaiſſal & ſubget the beſte knyght
that is noo al the world For in all the
world is noo knight that i wolde forſake
parys fore: ne one that hath doō
ſo moche for me / And thus to ſpeke
of the feates of parys ſhe coulde not
ſtynte. Then̄e came two damoyſelles
knockyng at the chābre dore ſayeng.
Vyēne ye muſt come to my lady
And yſabeau ſprang oute ſayēg
that ſhe ſholde come anone: And vienne
ſeyng that ſhe muſt nedes deꝑte
fro thens ſayd to yſabeau My ſuſter
ſyth we muſt deꝑte hens late vs take
ſomme of theſe jewellys. and we
ſhal kepe them ſecretly tyl that paris
becomen and we ſhall ſee what cō
                  tenaūce
he ſhal make in him ſelf.
               When̄e they took the colyer and the
whyte baner of vyenne ād other iewellys
& hydde thē vnder theyr clothes.
& wente into the chābre of meſſyre
Iaques: But vyenne deſydered
gretly to ſpeke with paris & thought
lōge or he came home. & in the mene
whyle meſſyre jaques recouuerd of
his maladye & bycam all hool wherof
vyēne had grete joye. but ſhe durſt
not ſhewe it / ¶ How parys ād Edward
                  retorned oute of braband
               
               
                  After certayn tyme that Parys
had be in Braband wyt
hys felawe Edward / he deſyred
ſtrongely to ſee the fayr vyēne
For the loue of hyr deſtrayned hym
moche ſtrōgeli. Neuertheles he durſt
not telle it to his felowe / to thēde that
he ſhold take noo diſplayſir of his departyng /
And ſone after the ſpace of
v. dayes parys receyued a letter that
his fader was ſeek / & thenne he ſayd
to Edward / Ryght dere brother and
felawe. pleſith it you to wete that mi
fader is fore ſeek. and me ſemeth hit
were good that we departed yf ye
conſente. but I praye you that ye take
noo diſplayſir in thys departyng
for yf it play ſe good we ſhal ſone retorne
And 
                  edward 
                  ſeyng the iuſte
reaſon of parys and his good wylle:
ſayd to him that he was wel cōtent
& pleſyd Wherfore incontynēte they
departed oute of Braband and came
into the cite of vyēne. of whos comyng
meſſyr jaques had ſouerayn
plaiſir / ſpecially bycauſe he had herde
that parys his ſone had doō valyaūtli
feates of armes. Now it happed
that whā parys was arriued at home
wyt his fader like as he was acuſtomed
alle way to fore or he wēte to
his bedde. he wēte to make his oroiſons
& prayers / & after he aduiſed if
he lacked ony thinge. & fōde that tho
thīges that he loued heſte were takē
awaye / wherof he was moch angri
& as half in deſpair: in ſuch wiſe that
all the nyght he coude not ſlepe: and
whā it cam in the mornyng he came
to his mod & ſayd Moder how is it
yt ye haue not kepte my chābre cloos

                  and ſhytte / For I lacke certayn thī
                  ges
whiche i wold not gladly leſe / &
haue for them grete dyſplayſir / To
whom hir moder anſwerd My ſone
by my fayth / there neuer entred therin
perſone. but on a tyme whā your
fader was ſeek / came my lady diane
and hir doughter Vyēne / and whā
they had 
                  vyſited your fad: they wē
                  te
al aboute for to ſee this caſtel. and
then̄e they entred in to your chābre / 
But I can not thynke that they took
ony thing for they taryed not longe
Sauf onely vyenne whiche taryed
onely allon̄ ſauf hyr damoiſel. bi cauſe
ſhe was euyll at eaſe at hyr hert / 
wherfore mi dere ſone parys i praye
you to take noo diſplayſir. And then̄
parys ſayd to hym ſelf. yf none other
theef haue taken it ſauf ſhe / i ſhal not
be dyſcouerd Neuertheles i wote neuer
yf vyenne hath taken it awaye.
for ony thinge. ¶ And after he arayed
him ſelf and cladde him moch
nobly & wente to do the reuerence to
the Daulphin and to dame Dyane.
And after to vyenne their doughter
ād the daulphyn receyued hym moche
curtoiſly. & the daulphyn demaū
                     ded
him tydinges ād of many other
thinges. And whā the fayr lady vienne
ſawe parys of the grete deſyre / 
that ſhe had to ſee hym. & of the grete
loue that ſhe bare to him: alle hyr
chere was coloured like a freſſhe roſe
in the monthe of maye / and coude
not be contente ne fylled to beholde
hyr fayre loue & frende parys. And
the more ſhe behelde hym: the more
grewe & entreaced hyr loue toward
hym: ād parys beyng tofore the daulphyn
on hys knee moche humbly:
durſt not loke on vyenne But in hys
herte he had grete paine. & who had
wel beholde hym / had wel ſeen in his
vyſage hys thought And after that
the daulphyn had 
                  demaunded him
of that it plaſed him / Parys took leue
of the daulphyn: ād of my lady diane.
& of vyēne theyr doughter. & retorned
home to his faders hous.
               After a fewe dayes Vyēne in ſuche
wyſe as loue deſtrayned hyr ſayd to

And on the morne the biſſhop

And if ye were taken I wote well

For be ye ſure though he neuer pardōne

Wherof meſſyre Iaques had grete

whan therle of Flaunders
had accorded the maryage
with the duc of bourgoygne he made

that he / whome he ſomoche
deſired ſholde come. he was moche
joyous. & incōtinēt dyd doo make redy
many grete & meruayllous feſtes
and duryng the ſame / dyd doo make
redy his ſone the duc of bourgoygne
horſes and peple for to accōpanye hī
whiche was a fayre thinge to ſee. ¶
And after ſent him to therle of flaū

which receyued him with grete
joye & with grete honour & feſted
hym two dayes: ād delyuerd to him

moche grete ioye & playſir. and eche
made grete feſte to other: which were
ouer lōge to recoūte. Neuertheles

tofore that the daulphyn came to the
ſone of the duc of bourgoygne / he ād
hys wyf entred into the chambre of
vyēne / to whome the daulphyn ſayd
Fayr doughter it was the playſir of

                  comforted vs with you. in whō we

truſte that by you we haue one. It is
trewe that ſo as god wyl ād hath ordeyned / 
we wyl aſſēble you to a moche
honourable maryage: the which
to vs playſeth moche. For I enſure
you the doughter of the noble kīge of

of the ſone of the duke of Bourgoyngne
& of you / wherfore we praye

But not wythſtonding that I be
in age for to marye. & that ī this maryage
I ſhold receyue honour more
than I am worthy. Neuertheles I
ſhal not yet be maryed for yf we haue
not this man / yf it playſe god we
ſhal haue an other as good or better
And thynke ye not myn honourable
lord / that I ſay this for ony excuſacyon.
but it is ſythen xx. dayes that I
haue be euyl deſpoſed of my perſone
ād the maladye that I haue cauſeth
me to take noo playſir for to be maried
For I haue avowed vnto god
neuer to be maryed to thys man ne
to none other. as longe as i ſhal be in
this maladye / Thenne thought the
dolphyn that vyēne ſayd it for ſhamefaſtnes:
Neuertheles he trauaylled
hyr euery day wyt fayre wordes
that ſhe ſhold conſente to this maryage / 
but it auaylled nothyng all that
he dyd: for the wyll of hyr was more
in Parys than in ony man of the
worlde
               Then̄e on the morne the ſone of the
duc of bourgoygne: ād the ſone of the
erle of Flaunders entred into the cite
of vyenne / wherof the Daulphyn
had grete. ioye and plaiſir: and thys
feſte ēdured wel fyſtene dayes. that
they dyd no thinge / but daunce ſynge
and dyd other diuers playſirs / & duryng
this feſte the daulphyn ſayd to
the ſone of the duke of bourgoigne to
thende that he ſhold thīke none euyll
bycauſe he abode ſo lōge or he might
eſpouſe hys doughtere: Fayr ſone I
praye you & biſeche that ye take you
to playſir & ioye. ād gryeue you noothynge
of thys longe abydyng here
For certayn my doughter is ſo ſeke
that vnnethe ſhe may ſpeke / whiche
doth to hyr grete deſplaiſir & ſhame / 

for fayn ſhe wold be out of hyr chambre
And thenne the ſone of the noble
duc of bourgoyn as he ſhat mēte but
good fayth / byleued it lightly Neuertheles
the dolphyn dyd nothīg night
ne day. but admoneſted his doughter
one tyme in fayr wordes / & an other
time in meanaces. but in noo wyſe he
coude make his doughter to conſēte:
And 
                  cōmaunded that ſhe ſhold 
                  nothing
haue but brede & water. & vienne
abode one day ſoo ī this maner:
And al this dyde the dolphyn to thē
                  de
that ſhe conſente in this mariage.
and alway he dyde to hyr more harme
and payne / & vyēne was alway
more herde and ferther fro his deſire
wherof the dolphyn had moche grete
dyſplayſir / & not withoute cauſe. &
ſeyng the dolphyn that his doughter
was ſoo indurate: he thought that biſōme
good moyen he wold ſente home
ageyn the ſone of the duc of bourgoyn / 
for he doubted that yf he abode
lōge that this feat might be diſcouerd
                     •
                  
                  and he gaf to him fayr jewellys &
after ſayd to him / Fayr ſone I wyll
that ye take noo diſplayſir in that I
ſhal ſaie to you. Ale ſemeth wel that
at this time this mariage may not go
forth of you and of my doughter / for
after that I ſee & as me ſemethe the
wille of god is ferther than I wold
at this tyme For he wil not that the
mariage of you and of my doughter
take now effecte: Wherfore I haue
right grete diſplayſir in my hert onely
for the loue of you / Then̄e the ſone
of the duc of bourgoygne ſeyng that
at that tyme he myght doo noo thīg
toke leue of the daulphyn and retorned
into his cōtree. by cauſe that vyenne
was not in helthe: and promyſed
that aſſone as he myght knowe
that ſhe ſhold be hool / he wold retorne
for to accomplyſſhe the mariage:
lyke as the Dolphyn had 
                  promyſed
to hym
               How the dolphyn dyd doo empryſonne
vyenne bycauſe that ſhe wold
not conſente to the mariage to the ſone
of the duke of Bourgoyne
               
                  
                  
                  AFter certayn dayes that the
ſone of the duke of Bourgoī
was departed fro the cyte of

that he had dyd do come tofore
him the maiſter Iayler of his priſon:
ād 
                  dyd do make within his paleys
alytel pryſon derke and obſcure
And he dyd do put vyenne and yſabeau
into that pryſon: and commaū

for I haue confydence in god
that ye ſhal haue yet moche welthe / 
for my fayr ſuſter it is a moche rightful
thing that for the good knight paris
whiche for me ſuffreth ſo moche
payne that i ſuffre this for him. & alſo
i ſay to yow that all the paynes of
this world be nothing greuoꝰ to me
whā I thinke on hys ſwete vyſage / 
and in this manere that one comforted

               ¶ How the ſone of the duc of bourgoyn
departed fro his countreye for
to come ſee the fayre lady vyenne
               
                  WHan the ſone of the duck of
bourgoyne had abyden lōge

ſo concluded to goo and ſee hyr / ād it
was not lōge after that he cam to the
dolphyn / & the dolphyn receyued him
moche gladly ād with grete honour
Then̄e prayed he the doulphyn that
it might pleſe hym to ſhewe to hī vienne
alſo ſeke as ſhe was / For in the
worlde was nothing that he ſoo moche
deſyred to ſee as hyr And the
dolphī 
                  ſeyng the wille & deſyre of hī /

deſyre that this mariage ſhold be made:
but my doughter for thys preſent

Wherfore i haue grete deſplaiſir
