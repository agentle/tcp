            THE PRAEFACE.
            JEntle Reader, I haue sette down heere in a dialogue, the practize of Sathan which hee vseth (as I haue obserued by experience) to subuert and vtterly ouerturne the course of the gospel here in England: the names of the speakers containe in them for the moste parte, the matter that they defend, and the affection that they are of. For thou knowest that Diotrephes was hee of whom S. Iohn speaketh in his third Epi. v. 9. that louing to haue the preheminence, disturbed the course of good things in the Church, and therefore sustaineth the person of a Bishop, or byshoplie prelate. Tertullus is he of whom Luke speaketh in the 24. Acts, that was the speaker in the ambassage from Hierusalem to Foelix the gouernor, against Paule, in the defence of ceremonies, abrogated from the ouerthrowe of the Gospell, and so representeth the Papists, that maintaine their trash, to the rooting out of true religion. Demetrius is he of whom mention is made in Actes

19. that was enemie to Paule, because he liued by an vnlawfull trade, and for that cause doth play the part of an vsurer. Paule was the defender you knowe of the Gospell in sinccritie, & he whose pen the holy Ghost did vse to expresse the discipline of the church most clerely, and therefore speaketh for the ministers of our time that stand for reformation. Pandocheus is an In-keeper in Greeke, and it is as much as to say, a receiuer of all, and a soother of euerie man for his gaine; so that the persons in their nature thus considered, it remaineth that thou wouldest be intreated by me, whosoeuer thou art, to whō this little booke shall come, that thou wouldest in reading of it, set all affectiō aside, & neither beleeue it, because one of thy disposition did pen it neither yet rei
                  •
               ct it. because it was not composed by one of thy complexion; but considd
                  •
               r well of the speeches vttered by euerie partie, & compare them with the practize of the worlde, and then looke what it is that so hardeneth Pandocheus in Atheisine, Demetrin in vsurie, & Tertullus in Papistrie; and you shall (I

doubt not) plainely perceiue, that the cause of all vngodlines so to raigne in euery place, and of the Papists so to increase in strength and number, ariseth from our Byshops and their vnlawfull gouernement; on the other side, looke into the answers that Diotrephes maketh to Paul, and the councell that Tertullus giueth to Diotrephes, and compare them with the practize of the B. in all pointes, and you shall euidentlye perceiue that the cause why the gospel being so long preached, & hath taken so little effect, ariseth from them onely, forsomuch as they haue weakened the knees of the true Preachers, and euerie way crossed them in all good actions. I haue touched thinges verie briefly of purpose, partly for that they who see what reformation meaneth, will quickly vnderstand my meaning, and partly, for that I would haue him that vnderstandeth not mine intent and would be resolued, to confer at large of it wyth some godly learned for his further instruction. Now I pray thee, let mee intreat thee to think thus of mine intent; namely, that it is not of purpose to disgrace

any man, albeit we ought to disgrace them, by whom God his sonne is disgraced: but especially to this end, that euery man in his calling, might see howe hee is or hath beene made an instrument to do harme, or for want eyther of knowledge, or prouident forecast, being ouertaken vnder colour of right and law, & lastly that we al seeing the subtilties of the deuill againste the kingdom of Christ Iesus, may first of al returne to God by speedie repentance, from the wickednesse that we haue in our hands, which in deede is the cause of this cursse vpon vs; and then praie vnto his Maiestie, that he would detect the craftie subtilties of all his aduersaries, reueale the trueth to those that are seduced and abused, and erect the kingdome of his Sonne Christ Iesus amongst vs, by the forme of that discipline that his owne worde expresseth vnto vs.
         
      
      
         
            
            The state of the Church of England.
            
               Diotreph
               MIne hoste, I pray you stay with  me and my friende M. Tertullus, and tell vs some newes, for wee are lately come out of Scotland, and would heare before wee come nere London, in what state things doo stand, least wee comming on a sudden, speede as ill as wee did at Edenborough, and S. Andrews.
            
            
               Pandoch
               Good my Lorde, I canne tell you no great newes, for I go not so farre as to  Church once in a moneth, but if I doo happen to go, one of my seruants doth come for me in all haste, to make merrie with one guest or other, but there be twoo in this house that came from London, if it please your L. I wil intreat one of them to come vnto you, it may be he can tell you some thing.
            
            
               Diotreph
               I pray thee doo so: you are welcome my friend, I vnderstand that you came  from London, I pray you tell me some newes for I hauing beene in Scotland, some space, haue not heard much of the state of England.
            
            
               Demetri
               My L. I heare no newes, but that our

Bishoppes (Gods blessing haue theyr heartes for it) say pretie wel, by one and by one, to these precise and hot Preachers, for some of them are putte to silence, some of them close prisoners in the Gate-house, some well loden wyth yrons in the White-lyon, and some in the Clinke, I hope to see them one day all put downe, for they trouble the whole land, and are neither contented to obey the authoritie of these holie fathers, neyther yet will suffer vs to liue as our fore-fathers haue doone before vs, and heere is a good fellowe which I met yesterday vppon the way, who is iust of their opinion.
            
            
               Pandoch
               I knowe not of what religion hee of whome you speake is of but I am sure  that hee hath manie of our Preachers quallities, for whiche I like him the woorse, for since our Preacher came, I haue not gained halfe so much as heretofore I did, but if I had but euery night suche a guest, wythin one moneth all men woulde refraine from comming to mine house, and so I might begge.
            
            
               Diotreph
               Why mine hoste, what are his qualities that you dislike so much? 
            
            
               
               Pandoeh
               VVhat? I will tell you, as soone as euer he lighted, my man that tooke his horse, chanced but to sweare by God, and he was reproouing of him by and by, and a gentleman cannot come in this euening, in any place where he is, but he is finding faut with him for one thing or another: and when he should go to supper, with other gentlemen, sitting at the lower end of the table, he would needes say grace (forsooth) before and after supper, and so stay them that were hungrie, from their meat the longer, and from their sleepe afterward but one wiser then the rest, serued him in his kinde, for he started vp saying: my father had neuer grace said before meate, neither will I haue any.
            
            
               Diotreph
               I perceiue he is one of these peeuish puritanes, that troubled the Church,  when my friend and I went into Scotland, haue not the Bishops yet suppressed them, neither by countenance, nor by authoritie?
            
            
               Tertulluss
               Suppressed; No my Lord, a frind of  mine writ vnto mee, that one of theyr Preachers said in a pulpit, he was perswaded that there were 100000 of

them in Englande, and that the number of them encreased daily in euerie place of all estates and degrees.
            
            
               Diotreph
               I am sory for that, I maruell that you neuer tould me of it. 
            
            
               Tertullus
               I did of purpose conceale it, least, togither with your ill successe that you,  and so consequently I, had in Scotlād, your griefe should haue bene aggrauated, for I know how that the growing of them doth grieue you.
            
            
               Diotreph
               You may be sure, that it would haue grieued mee, if you had tould me that,  when you tould me of the encreasing of your friendes the Papists, I thinke I should haue died for sorrow.
            
            
               Tertullus
               I knowe that, therefore did I keepe it cloase, but if newes had come in like  monne, of the growing of the Catholique religion vnto your man, that Puritane knaue, hee would haue tould it you at the first, and so haue molested you the more.
            
            
               Diotreph
               You say well, and I percciue it is better to haue a Papist, than a Puritane in  an house, and more charitie to do for them.
            
            
               Pandoeh
               Your Lordshippe asked me forsome

newes, but your speach of your being, and ill successe that you hadde in Scotland, giueth me occasion, to enquire of you (if I may be so bolde) Some Scottish newes.
            
            
               Diotreph
               Ah my hoste, though it grieue mee to thinke vppon it, yet it easeth my stomacke  to tell it out. The Puritanes in Scotland, haue got vp their discipline, and vtterly ouerthrowen all the soueraigntie of Bishops, by which they preuailed so mightilie, that we feared our fall in England shortlie to ensue, whervpon I was sent togither with this my friend, who came out of Fraunce into England, to go and seeke the subuersion of their great assemblies, and the rest of their iurisdiction, wherein I preuailed a while, but nowe it is woorse, than euer it was.
            
            
               Pandoeh
               How came it to passe, that when you  had gotten some ground, you held it not?
            
            
               Diotreph
               Because the whole land cried out for  Discipline againe, and the noble men so stifly did stand to it, and lastly, the Ministers that came home from England, dealt so boldelie with the King,

that I was vtterlie cast out without all hope, euer to do any good there again, and nowe I make homewarde in haste, least I loose all there also, but I praye you helpe me to speake with that Puritane, I shall learne more by him, because he is better acquainted wyth the cause than either of you.
            
            
               Demetri
               Hee may soone knowe more in that  case than I, for I promise you, mine onely studie is in my counting house, to see my money, and when each parcel is due vnto me.
            
            
               Pandoch
               And I meddle with nothing but my In-keeping, as for these controuersies  and this scripturing, I neuer trouble my selfe wyth it, but I will goe to him to see whether I can get him to come to your Lordship: but before I go, I must beseech you to saye nothing to him as from mee, for you knowe, I must bee friendly to all, least I leese my custome, and driue away some of my guests.
            
            
               Diotreph
               Great reason, for euerie man must  liue of his trade, neyther must you tell him what I am.
            
            
               Pandoch
               Sir, heere bee certaine gentlemen in  an other chamber, that hearing of your

comming from London, would gladlie speake with you.
            
            
               Paule
               Whence are they can you tell? 
            
            
               Pandoch
               They are English men, but they are  but new come out of Scotland.
            
            
               Paule
               I am willing to go to them, though it be late, and so much the rather, bicause  I long to heare some good newes from thence.
            
            
               Pandoch
               Here is the Gentleman that you desired to speake withall. 
            
            
               Diotreph
               You are welcome my frind, I was desirous to speak with you, for that I perceiue  you came from London, I praie you, can you tell vs any good newes?
            
            
               Paule
               No surely, for I am a verie ill obseruer of such things. 
            
            
               Diotreph
               You seeme to be a Minister, can you tell me what good successe my Lordes  the Bishops haue in their proceedings?
            
            
               Paule
               They haue too good successe, they wax worse and worse, they grow euen  to the heigth of their iniquitie, so that I hope their kingdom wil not stand long.
            
            
               Diotreph
               Why sir, what doe they, that they  offend you so grieuously?
            
            
               Paule
               They stop the mouth of the sheepeheardes,  and set at liberty the rauening

wolues, and turne the foxes among the lambes.
            
            
               Diotreph
               I must desire you to expresse your minde more plainely, for you seeme to  bee so possessed with discontentment, that it maketh you to speak (as it were) snatchingly.
            
            
               Paule
               I confesse my selfe discontented, and greatly grieued, but yet not so much, as  to make mee lesse able to expresse my minde.
            
            
               Diotreph
               I pray you therefore, lay open your former speeches, that I may vnderstand  your meaning.
            
            
               Paule
               My meaning is this; That there are three abhominations committed by  them: The first is, that they do beare such an enmity against the kingdome of Iesus Christ, that they put to silence one after an other, and will neuer cease (if God bridle them not) vntill they haue rooted out of the Church, all the learned, godly, and painefull teachers: The second is, that they enlarge the libertie of the common enemies the papists: The last is, that they commit the feedinge of the flockes of Christe, vnto those that prey vpon them, and eyther

cannot, or will not labour to reclaime the wandering sheepe. So that the conclusions that may bee gathered vppon their actions, must needes be the euersion and ouerthrow of the Gospell, and so consequently the bringing in of popery and atheisme.
            
            
               Diotreph
               They put none to silence, but the puritans, who do indeede more hurt than  good.
            
            
               Paule
               I know no puritans, if there be anie, it is meete that they be put to silence:  But Sathan taught the Papistes, so to name the ministers of the Gospell, and you are his instrument in continuing the same rerme.
            
            
               Diotreph
               I meane them, that are not contented with the estate, but mislike the gouernement  of the Church, and woulde haue a newe forme of gouernement, which would marre all.
            
            
               Paule
               Woulde you haue them contented with Antichristian prelates, to bee rulers  of the spouse of Christ, when as the word of God hath prescribed expresly, another form direct contrary to that?
            
            
               Diotreph
               I am a doctor of diuinity at the least, and yet could I neuer reade any thing

in the worde of God, contrarie to this gouernement, neyther yet to speake of any other, but that the ordering of the Church is left to the discretion of the wise and learned.
            
            
               Paule
               Yes, you haue read it, if God had giuen you eyes to see it: But if your study  had beene principally to aduaunce Gods glorie, and benefite his Church, which you neuer aymed at, but rather preferred vaine glorye and gaine, you should easily haue found it. I pray you therefore, when you come to London, see if you can get these bookes: the Ecclesiasticall Discipline: A lerned discourse of Ecclesiasticall gouernement: The Counterpoyson: A Sermon vpon the 12. to the Romanes, & M. Cartwrites last reply: some of which bookes haue bene extant this dozen yeeres, and yet are none of them answered, and you shall finde it otherwise.
            
            
               Diotreph
               If their Lordsh, were taken away, the  credite of the Gospell would fall to the ground, and men would not regarde it.
            
            
               Paule
               Nay, their iurisdiction maketh it not  to be regarded, for the simplicitie of the Gospell, can not match with such

outward pompe, it was of more credit before their calling was hatched, than euer it was since.
            
            
               Diotreph
               I hope neuer to see thē ouerthrown,  and I thinke they will neuer giue ouer their Byshopricks.
            
            
               Paule
               I am of your mind, that they wil neuer  giue them ouer, they haue such experience of the gaine of them, the vse of the bagge preuailed so much with one of their Apostles, that rather than hee woulde lacke money, he would sell Iesus Christ himselfe.
            
            
               Diotreph
               You speak too vnreuerently and vncharitablie  of these holy fathers.
            
            
               Paule
               Surely I haue so much experience of  their impious dealing, that I canne no better esteeme of them in respecte of their plaees, than of the ennemies of God, but as they bee men, I will not cease to pray for them, that God would open their eies, that they may see their sinnes, and repent, which is the best waie to deale charitablie with them.
            
            
               Diotreph
               I pray you tell ne why these men be  put to silence, I am sure it is for theyr notorious misdemeanor.
            
            
               Paule
               I will tell you wherefore some of

them were put to silence; one had conference with a Bishop about subscription, and he was restrained for that hee gaue his friende a coppie of his conference, another, because he taught that the Church of Antichrist was no parte of the Church of God, another, because his praiers before and after Sermons were too long, and such like.
            
            
               Diotreph
               Away, it is rather for not obseruing the booke of common praier, than for  any such thing as you speake of.
            
            
               Paule
               Indeed many are suppressed therfore, but if any man will giue them their titles  and authoritie, they will giue hym leaue to vse his discreation wyth the Booke, as wee see by experience, for they vse the Booke and ceremonies as brieles to curb them that ki
                     •
                  k at their lordlinesse, which is the onelie thing that they mind.
            
            
               Diotreph
               Well, I loue not to heare these reuerend fathers so abused, and therefore I  praye you talke no more of it, but if it please you, you may depart.
            
            
               Paule
               I am contented, onlie let me request you this one thing, that for so much as  GOD hath giuen you learning, you

would praye vnto God, to guide you with his grace, that you abuse it not to your owne destruction, but employ it to his glory, and the good of his church.
            
            
               Diotreph
               I thanke you for your good counsell,  and so fare you well, we will talke more in the morning.
            
            
               Paule
               With a good will: I praye God our  talke may tend to a good end.
            
            
               Diotreph
               M. Demetrius and mine hoste, howe like you this fellew? is hee not a sawcie merchant, to presume thus to speake against those that were Preachers before he was borne? But this is the miserie of our nation, that euerie yong boy will take vppon him to reach the ancient, and to reprooue them, for that their greene heades thinke that to bee true.
            
            
               Pandoch
               Your Lordship saith very well, I pray  you forget not to vrge him with that in the morning. For it must needs make him mute.
            
            
               Demetri
               I promise you he is a bolde fellowe,  it is no maruayle, if such as hee is, doe stand stiffe against vs that be vnlerned, seeing they bee so bolde with you, I tel you, he tooke me vp as if I had bin but

a kitchin boye, and all because I saide I liued by my monie, and was of no other trade, calling me caterpiller, thief, and murtherer, and saide plainely, that he that robbed in Stran-gate hole, was an honester man than I.
            
            
               Diotreph
               You must take heed, that you do not oppresse your brother too much, but  as for these fellowes, it is their manner to be so bitter and sharpe, that they do euer with their preaching, more hurte than good.
            
            
               Demetri
               I hope you wil course him tomorow  for it: but I pray you my L. let me haue a little talke betweene you and me, of a matter that now commeth in my mind; this man that is with you, and went and came in your company, what is he?
            
            
               Diotreph
               To be plaine with you, he is a Papist. 
            
            
               Demetri
               Papists are enemies to the Queenes  religion and lawes; I do therefore much maruaile, that he should be put in trust by the Bishops.
            
            
               Diotreph
               The cause is this, he light into the familiaritie  of one of our friendes, who confuted a Booke called the Abstract, and helped him so painefully with reasons out of the Rhemish testament, and

other such like writers, to confute the Puritans, that he was thought a fit man aboue all other of his religion, to goe with me.
            
            
               Demetri
               Why, coulde you not haue had another  of your relgion, but you must needs haue a Papist your assistant?
            
            
               Diotreph
               No, no, if I had not had a Papist with  me, I could neuer haue looked to haue preuailed.
            
            
               Demetti
               Why so? I pray you tel me the reason  of that.
            
            
               Diotreph
               Because our dignities and gouernement,  commeth wholy and euerie part thereof from the Pope, and is ruled and defended by the same canons, whereby his popedome is supported. So that if I had wanted their helpes, I had had none authoritie, eyther from God or man, no helpe either by reason or learning, whereby I could haue beene furthered.
            
            
               Demetri
               Why did you not rather take some  doctour of the Arches, to go with you?
            
            
               Diotreph
               That was consulted vppon before I  went, but it was not thought meet, because the most of them woulde neuer deale in that lawe at home, but onely

because they knowe not else howe to liue, & therfore it was feared that they woulde not be sufficiently diligent in a matter that concerneth others. And for the rest (who indeede) be the same men they were in Queene Maries time, we durst not carrie anie of them from home, for none defend our kingdome thorowlie but they.
            
            
               Demet
                     •
                  i
               Me thinks this man should be an vnfit  assistant, for if he be a right Papist, he will labor to erect the Popes kingdom, and so to crosse you.
            
            
               Pandoch
               No question but he did so, and that  made for vs, for albeit we would if wee might, of the twaine, keepe rather the protestants religion with our dignities than the other, yet hadde wee rather change our religion, than to forgo our priuiledges; this I tell you betweene you and me, but I would haue it go no further.
            
            
               Demetri
               Do the old popish doctors stand you  in such gret steed, me think you might haue hadde learned lawyers for cuerie place before this time, and haue turned them out:
            
            
               Diotreph
               It is true, but we haue receiued them

of purpose (man) for we can beare, I tel you, with their religion, so that they do beare vp our authoritie: doe you not see likewise, that we haue reserued ma
                     •
                   my popish prists in the ministery, wherof diuerse doe yet remaine, which wee haue done vpon speciall consideration: to wit, least there should be too manie learned, not one whereof will stand to vs, sane onely they that eyther haue, or looke to haue better preferment, or liue more easilie than S. Paules Epistles will allow them.
            
            
               Demetri
               I haue beene bold to trouble your L.  I will nowe leaue you for this time, I will come vnto you in the morning to breakfast.
            
            
               Diotreph
               You shall be welcome vnto me at all  times, for I perceyue you are none of them that fauor the Puritans.
            
            
               Pandoch
               My L. your breakfast is redy, wil you  haue them come to you that were here yesternight.
            
            
               Diotreph
               I would haue him that taried yesternight  so late, for hee is a very honest gentleman, and a quiet, but in any case let not the Puritane come vntill breakfast be done, for he is too precise: I must

needs be mery, and if he be here, he wil not let to reproue vs, if wee do butfortune to swear at vnawares, so that I shal be afraid of him in euery word I speak.
            
            
               Pandoch
               Heere is but simple cheare this morning, because it is fasting-day. 
            
            
               Diotreph
               M. Tertullus wil eat no egges to day: will you M. Demetrius? 
            
            
               Demetri
               Yea by S. Mary, I am a protestant, for I loue to eate flesh on the friday.
            
            
               Diotreph
               It is well said, but I pray you, thinke  not ill of me M. Tertullus for it, for saint Paul hath taught vs, that we that eate, should not indge them that eate not; for wee being strong, must beare with the infirmities of the weake.
            
            
               Demetri
               You promised yester-night to sende  for the Puritane, to talke further with him, I pray you do so, for I woulde haue him taunted thorowlie.
            
            
               Diotreph
               By my troth I hadde forgotten him,  mine host, call him.
            
            
               Pandoch
               Heere is the Gentleman you willed  me to call.
            
            
               Diotreph
               You are welcome, this Gentleman  M. Demetrius telleth me, that you, and hee, had great controuersie on the wap yesterday, and he is very defirous that I

might heare your reasons, and giue my iudgement of them for his satisfaction.
            
            
               Paule
               Sir, I saide nothing to hym but the truth out of the worde of God, in condemning  of vsurie, by which he saide he liued, and shewed him the horriblenesse of the sinne, the inconueniences temporall that come of it in the commonwealth, and the iudgements of God against the practises thereof.
            
            
               Diotreph
               Vsurie in deed in some sort is vnlawfull,  but it seemeth that you dealt not with the man, as meaning to win him, but rather by such sharpenes as might harden him.
            
            
               Paule
               Surely my desire was to winne him, and therefore my purpose in reasoning  was, to lay open the sinne vnto him, and the cause why I dealt som what roundly, was this: hee confessed the scriptures that I alleadged, but so cauelled and wrangled against the cleare light therein conteined, that it appeared vnto me his purpose was, not onely to abide an vsurer, but also to iustifie it by the word of God.
            
            
               Diotreph
               Such chollerike fellowes as you doe  marre al, for you cannot deale mildely,

and so you trouble the conscience, and disquiet the minde of the weake.
            
            
               Paule
               His conscience must be troubled by launcing, before that euer his soule can  be cured.
            
            
               Diotreph
               Then I perceiue you like wel of them that prech the law so much as they do. 
            
            
               Paule
               Yea, or else should I not like of bringing  men vnto Christ, which can neuer be vntil they be humbled by the law, & made pure therby to receue the gospel.
            
            
               Diotreph
               Doe you not also like of them, preaching  of predestination?
            
            
               Paule
               Yea, or els should I dislike of preaching the truth, for it is a part of Gods reuealed  will.
            
            
               Diotreph
               So do not I in these dais, when there bee so many weake ones, I thinke it to  be a very breake-necke of all religion.
            
            
               Paule
               I haue heard of free-will men, that  haue saide so, but I neuer heard man of learning affirme it, but one that was a Bishoppe in a Sermon, but his wordes were no lesse than blasphemie, and so are yours, and al they that say or think the same are guiltie of no lesse sinne.
            
            
               Diotreph
               Are you a Preacher and speake so of  these reuerend fathers, it may be your

own ordinary to whom you are sworne to giue canonicall obedience.
            
            
               Paule
               It was the Bishop indeede, who vsurped  euen the place where I dwelt, but I neuet sware him anie obedience.
            
            
               Diotreph
               Well, we are gone from our matter. 
            
            
               Paule
               And I pray you let vs tarry a little  longer from it, to consider one thing before wee doe returne, which the talking of the Bishops bringeth into my head.
            
            
               Diotreph
               What is that? 
            
            
               Paule
               Surely, that I thinke you are either a  B. or else brought vp in the schoole of a B. and woulde faine be one, for you doe vse your selfe verie like, as I haue knowne them do.
            
            
               Diotreph
               Wherein? 
            
            
               Paule
               In this, that wheras we reasoning of  vsurie, wherein your conscience is clear within, you are contented for the fauor of him, and for that you like not me, to maintain the same, and to disgrace the truth, because of the partie that defendeth it, who is not according to your humor.
            
            
               Diotreph
               You may bee ashamed to speake to  of these holy fathers, I dare say, that

none of them euer did so.
            
            
               Paule
               If mine eares had not heard it, mine eies seene, & mine owne person had not  felt the experience thereof, I shoulde haue beene of your minde, for I once liked them, and their verie wicked dealings made mee looke into the lawfulnes of their calling, which I see now to be meere Antichristian: but shall I tell you one example among manic?
            
            
               Diotreph
               I am willing to heare you, but I can neuer be brought to thinke so. 
            
            
               Paule
               Yet will I tell it you, that you may thinke of it, I was accused vnto the B.  of such crimes as were most slaunderous and false, where vpon I desired him to send for mine accusers, and see how they coulde prooue, that I (if I were con
                     •
                  icted) might be punished, or else they might haue the rewarde that molesters of the preachers of the Gospell do deserue: he graunted it me, and appoynted a day, which being come, rather than I (whome hee thought not to fauor his authoritie) should haue anie helpe at his handes, hee made mee a sleeueles aunswere, and sent mee away. Thus are Byshoppes coutented to bee

bawdes vnto al kinde of sinners, rather than they will any way seeme to further the ministerie of those whome they fauour not, and euen thus doe you: for your hatred vnto my person, maketh you to stand with that monstrous vsurer, but take hecde of it, for God will not be mocked, he seeth your dealing, and will iudge you accordingly, howsoeuer you can pretend the contrarie to the world.
            
            
               Diotreph
               As for mine owne part, I passe not  what you speake: but let me aske you one question concerning these holie fathers, and that is this, what reason is there that they should do anie good in any respect vnto any of you, seeing they knowe you to bee professed foes vnto their dignities.
            
            
               Paule
               Because they taking themselues to  be the fathers of the Church, shoulde haue a regarde to the good cause, and defend it without respect of persons.
            
            
               Diotreph
               No sir, I see no reason in that, for aboue  all things, they must look to thē
                  selues, without whose authoritie the Gospell would be troden vnder foote: and therfore they may defend no cause

nor person further than may stand with their owne safety.
            
            
               Paule
               Suppose that were lawfull, what hinderance  is this to themselues, to see thē that bee common and knowne drunkards, vsurers, adulterers, and profane persons punished, for that they are railers at me, for teaching the 'trueth of religion, and reproouing sharply their godlesse conuersation.
            
            
               Diotreph
               Oh you are a simple man, it is great hinderance, for they can do nothing in  defence of you, though it be in matters wherein you and they doe agree, but it tendeth to the derogation of their own estimation, such is the contrarietie betwixt your building and theirs.
            
            
               Paule
               By that meanes shall we be so wearied with aduersaries, that we shal neuer  haue any hope to doe good, but euen to be constrained to giue ouer the ministerie.
            
            
               Diotreph
               I woulde I might see that once come  to passe, we haue laboured for it hitherto, and neuer could attaine vnto it neyther will the Church euer bee in quiet vntill you all be turned out.
            
            
               Paule
               So thought the Sodomites, that they

should neuer be wel, so long as Lot was in their citie; but when he was gone, fire from heauen consumed them: but I pray you tell me, if all were turned out, how should the people be taught, for it is euident, that none else (almost) maketh a conscience of his duty that way.
            
            
               Diotreph
               You think teaching wold faile without you: No sir, teaching woulde bee  more regarded than it is.
            
            
               Paule
               Shew me how that can be. 
            
            
               Diotreph
               Wee woulde haue none to preach aboue once a moneth, and then shoulde  he doe it profoundly, and confirme his matter out of the fathers, and humane writers substantially, whereas you taking vpon you to preach three or foure times a week, must not onely of necessitie handle your matters verie rawlie, but also breede loathsomnesse in the people.
            
            
               Paule
               Surely my hart waxeth cold, and my  flesh trembleth to heare you speake so monstrously: dooth preaching consist in quoting of doctors, and alleadging of Poets and Philosophers, in what part of his commission hath a minister war rant so to do? You finde fault with our

often preaching, because your selues cannot so doe, but if you woulde leaue off your vaine glory, in hunting after promotion, and your couetousnesse in adding murther vnto theft, I meane liuing to liuing, and betake your selues to study and praier, bending your whole indeuor to the glorie of God, and edifying of his people, you should see the blessing of God so aboundantly vppon you, that you shold preach foure times euery week, with more fruite than you can doe nowe foure times euery yeare, for while you bee minded as you are, the Lords iudgment is vpon your gifts, and his cursse vpon your labours, that you appeare ridiculous euen vnto children. And whereas you say often preaching cloyeth the people, you shewe your selfe plainely to haue no feeling in the sweetnes of the worde of God: for it is so delightfull vnto the childe of God, that the more he heareth and readeth it, the more desirous is he to proceede therein, it is the propertie of the vngodly, to whome the word is foolishnes to be cloied with the same.
            
            
               Diotreph
               You shal not be my teacher, neither

wil I learne at your hands, I know wel inough what I haue to do.
            
            
               Paule
               I do not speak as a teacher vnto you,  but in brotherly loue doo admonishe you, and if you refuse mine (or rather the councell of the holie-ghost vttered by me) you doo but as they do, whose condition you defend, I pray God forgiue it you, and lay it neither to your nor their charge.

               They are great moates in your eies,  they know better what to do than you can tell them, they see what is meet for the Church, being auncient graue men of long experience, better than a sort of yong boyes start vp but yesterday.
            
            
               Paule
               Though some be but yong, yet al are not so, for we haue some more ancient  than they haue any, we haue of all ages and degrees of Schooles to compare with the best of them, and yet yeares, and humane learning, and experience, must not carrie away the matter, but the euidence of truth in the old & new Testament, and as for experience, they haue none, for they were first brought vppe in the vniuersities, then became Deanes, and such iollie fellowes, and

nowe are made Mitred Lordes, so that they cannot tel what it is to traine vp a people to the gospel, & reclaime them from ignorance and sinne, for they neuer stouped so lowe as to labour therein, but if they had euen my experience, they would sing an other song, for before I came into the haruest to worke, I liked their hierarchy wel inough, but when I laid it to my labours to further them, I found that they coulde not possibly stand together.

               Did the gospell euer so flourishe in Englād as it doth now at this present? 
            
            
               Paule
               No surely, God be praised for it, and encrease it more & more, but to what  end do you speake it?
            
            
               Diotreph
               To prooue that the authoritie, and wise gouernement of the Bishops hath  had good successe.
            
            
               Paule
               I thought so, but it is (if you woulde looke into the matter with a single eie)  cleane contrarie, for the good that hath bin done, the Lorde hath brought it to passe by these menne whome you despise, and by that course which the Bishops were euer enemies vnto.

               How can you proue that I pray you,

let mee heare your reasons that mooue you to thinke so, for I am perswaded of the cleane contrarie.
            
            
               Paule
               It serueth not in this case what you  are perswaded of, for a Bishoptick hath so blinded your eies, & corrupted your iudgement, that you like nothing but that which agreeth therewithall, but I will shew you my reasons that maketh me of that iudgement, and if you look equallie into the matter, or aske anie indifferent man, you shall see it to bee so.
            
            
               Diotreph
               Shew mee them, for I long to heare  them, I am sure they be wise stuffe.

               First for the men, what congregatiō,  what towne or people is there in this land, that they haue bene in the raigne of our soueraine Q. Elizabeth, conuerted to the gospell, that those men haue not bene the instruments to performe, whome the Bishops haue continuallie persecuted, and for the courses that haue bene taken, and which God hath greatly blessed, which of them haue not bin ouerturned by the Bish. and the preachers put to silence, assoone as euer the gospell beganne to appeare: On

the other side, tell me if you be able, of any such effect of the ministerie of a B. or bishoplie preacher, in anie place of this land, though it hath beene interrupted these twelue yeeres, as you shal see in many places by the other sort, euen in few moneths now and then, so that the matter is not onelie cleare vnto all that will weigh it in the ballance of equitie, but vnto me, if I had no reason, it is an euidēt proofe that they take the right way, whose labours the Lorde doth so blesse, and contrariwise, the curse of God is on the other, for their indirect dealing.
            
            
               Diotreph
               Thus you imagin because you please your selfe in your owne peeuish waies,  but tell me who are of your opinion: euen a few Puritans like your selfe.
            
            
               Pauls
               Call vs as you list, Christ was neuer the woorse for that his ennemies called  him a seducer, & a deceiuer of the people, but I am sure (all for the most parte that feare God) of euerie degree and calling, are of the same minde, sauing those whom you by your sutleties haue be witched.
            
            
               Diotreph
               You will haue but a few then in this

land that feare God, and so you will condemne the rest, which is the maner of all of you.
            
            
               Paule
               I condemne none, I wishe that not a  few, but all (if it were possible) did truely feare God, but I woulde haue you learne of Christ wyth me, who may without disgrace be your teacher, to trie the tree by the fruit, and seeke me out that man which maketh a conscience of sinne, and hath a care to liue as a christian, that is not of the same mind with vs: on the other side marke what kinde of men they be, that are the patrous and defenders of the Bishops, and you shal see them to be men that make no reckoning of sinne, but haue their wayes fraughted with all impietie, if they bee ttied with the touchstone of Gods word.
            
            
               Diotreph
               Well then you confesse yet, that the  generall sway goeth on our side, and so long as it is so, we care not.
            
            
               Paule
               I wil easily grant it, and so haue they  from the beginning, and shall to the ending of the world (against all goodnes) but I will tel you one thing euen of thē, that few of them like you indeed.
            
            
               
               Diotreph
               How can these twoo stand together, many are with vs, & few like of vs, they be meere contrary?
            
            
               Paule
               I wil tel you how, the Papist is on the  Bi. side, because he can finde shilter vnder them to hide his idolatry. The atheist is tooth and naile for them, because by them he enioieth carnal libertie, the man of most notorious life defendeth thē, bieause he can frō thē, redeeme the corporal punishment of his sins by mony, but none of these like of thē indeed; The first, because they keepe the possession of the seats of their popish prelats, the other, because they are so greedie in their courts for money, that euen euery man crieth shame on them, who then do loue them indeed, and sticke to them onely? these three hang-bies, that depend vpon them, and liue by them, as their chaplains and seruants, the Cananits (I should say) the Canonists, and such ministers as either cannot, or will not, labour in their function, to conuert soules vnto God, so that they doo stincke in the nostrels both of God & man, especially in these three last yeeres of their tyrannie, that I doe verily hope

their sinne is very neare the heigth, and the Lord in mercy will ease vs of them shortly.
            
            
               Diotreph
               You are a strange fellow, and please your selfe with wonderful perswasions,  but I pray you tel me, what maketh you say they are now more hated, seeing that in the last yeares, the best meanes haue bin vsed to establishe the ministery in a consent and conformitie vnto them.
            
            
               Paule
               Let the meanes be as good as it will,  I praise God for the successe of it, howsoeuer the contrary was meant.
            
            
               Diotreph
               Why praise you God for it, I am sure  you neuer liked of it?
            
            
               Paule
               The meanes indeede, I neuer liked,  neither I thinke, did euer any reasonable man, but it being a britle wall, dawbed with vntempered morter, had that successe that such sandie foundations do deserue.
            
            
               Diotreph
               Why man, what successe had it, I am  sure the greatest part, yea euen of your forwardest men subscribed: and those that did not, are not like to 
                     •
                  arry in the Church very long.
            
            
               Paule
               Wel, sooth vp your selfe in your own

perswasion, and brag of the multitude of subscribers, if it were to doo againe, hundreds of them would neuer doo it, because they were subtilly circumuented and deceiued (they meaning well, & tendring the peace of the Church) but (being now sorie for it) wil stand in defence of the cause (I dare say for them) with their brethren, euen vnto death: So that the Bysh, haue but their names written: And yet that if they would also, shew the protestations and condicions, by which they were induced, and wherof the B. made alowance, it wold plainely appeare, that either they dealt wickedly to admit exceptions, if the articles were true, or more vngodly if they were not, euer to attempt any such matter.
            
            
               Diotreph
               Tell me now, what is that wherein you seeme to reioice, as though the issue  of it fell on your side?
            
            
               Paule
               It is euen this, that the Bish. straight dealing made men to looke so narrowly  into the cause, and to seeke the reasons on both sides, for their owne satisfaction, that there are at this day (I am fullie perswaded) tenne times as manie

of all degrees, that are fully perswaded of the matters of reformation as were before, so gracious God is vnto his seruaunts, to make euen their enemies to do them good, and so tender is hee ouer his owne cause and glorie, that he wil make the verie meanes intended to oppugne it, be notable wayes to aduance it.
            
            
               Diotreph
               I do not beleeue you, albeit I cannot controll you in it, because I haue not  bin in England of late, but what will come of it, if it be so?
            
            
               Paule
               Euen the gouernment of the church,  by the rules of that discipline whiche Christ him selfe hath prescribed in his word, which I do perswade my selfe to see before it be long.
            
            
               Diotreph
               You woulde be examined before a iustice & punished, for saying you hope  to see an alteration, you cannot be the Q. friend that thus looke for innouations in the state.
            
            
               Paule
               Examine me when you will, and punish  me as God shall giue you leaue, I will be tried to be so far the Q. friend, as that I wish so well vnto hir as vnto mine owne soule, and all that I saye or

desire, is not to inuert any thing in the state that is good, but to haue the corruption thereof remooued, and hir maiestie more honoured before God and men, in drawing more neare vnto hir God, in aduauncing the kingdome of his sonne more gloriously within hir dominions.
            
            
               Diotreph
               These be but fained wordes, I do not beleeue that you speake as you thinke. 
            
            
               Paule
               It is bicause you measure me by your selfe, who indeede care neither for Qu.  Countrey, nor your owne soule, but for a Bishoppricke, but I thanke God in Christ, my conscience beareth me witnesse that they be all verie deare vnto me.
            
            
               Diotreph
               Away thou railing hypocrite, I will  talke with thee no longer, if I catch thee in London, I will make thee kisse the Clincke for this geare.
            
            
               Paule
               Indeede the Clincke, Gate-house,  White-lion, & the fleet haue bin your onely arguments whereby you haue prooued your causes these manie yeres, but you shall preuaile no longer, for your wickednesse is made manifest vnto all men, which God will shortlie repay

into your own bosoms seuen fold, but pray you to God to giue you repentance that those things happen not vnto you.
            
            
               Diotreph
               Pray thou for thy selfe, and care not  for mee; I knowe well inough what I haue to do without thy counsell, but it is your manner to teach all men.
            
            
               Tertullus
               Out vpon him, what a fellowe is this  my Lord? I neuer heard such a one in my life.
            
            
               Diotreph
               I can tell you, he gesseth shrewdlie I per eiue, that our course which wee  haue taken, and our intent in our actions haue bin descried by one meanes or other.
            
            
               Tertullus
               My lord, it was a thing obserued in the Puritans at Geneua, and in France,  while I was in Rhemes, that we could neuer inuent anie practise, for the furtheraunce of the Catholique religion, but they knew it often before wee put it in execution, so that for the moste part, they preuent all our determinations.
            
            
               Diotreph
               Howsoeuer it be, I am wonderfully sorie that they seeme so to triumph,  and that our matters haue no better

successe, it behoueth vs to looke about vs, we will speed our selues to London, to take some way in hast, least it be too late: in the meane while, I pray you tell me, for you must be my counseller whé all is done, what way you thinke best to be taken.
            
            
               Tertullus
               I will doo the best I can, I must first request one thing of you before I ioine  to help you.
            
            
               Diotreph
               What is that? if it be not vnreasonable you may assure your selfe of it, for  you know that I haue neuer bin strait laced against you nor anye of your friends.
            
            
               Tertullus
               I doubt not of it, but how can I haue  it before I aske it of you? you know, that we receiued letters from England, that there were verie hard lawes made this last parliament against the Catholikes: this is it therfore I must request, that you would vse meanes that the rigour of them be not inforced, for you knowe that wee haue many, both in Court and countrey, that shall else bee in great danger.
            
            
               Diotreph
               I am verie well contented to doo so,  but what way shall I take to do it?
            
            
               
               Tertullus
               Surely, such a way as shall also make greatly for your owne cause, and that is this, complaine of the domesticall, for the Puritan, and say, that they bee woorse than we, and that you shall neuer preuaile against vs, vntill first they be suppressed, and desire that we may be let alone for a time, and that al men would bend their forces against them.
            
            
               Diotreph
               This is excellent, I am verie willing  to do this, for it will helpe forward our owne cause: nowe go on and tell mee what is to be doone further.
            
            
               Tertullus
               The first thing you must take in hād, must be the suppression of those preachers  in London, and in other countries that be of most speciall note, for their forwardnes against you, and you must do it verie wisly: that is, you may not suppresse them all at once, neither all of them in a long time, for you must take heede that the world do not conceiue opinion of you, to be enemies to the Gospell, for then haue you no way but to turne wholie vnto vs.
            
            
               Diotreph
               That will be a verie good way, but how shall we haue good matter against  them, for their liues are thought to be

very vpright, and they haue learned of late to be more pollitike than heeretofore: for if they speak against any thing established, they doo it so cunningly, that aduantage can not be taken against them by law?
            
            
               Tertullus
               Neuer doubt of that, was there euer any man that went to beat a dogge, but  he could easily finde out a staffe to doo it, you must in this case preferre your safetie before your credit, or the estimation of anye that belongeth vnto you?
            
            
               Diotreph
               Yea, but shew me some particulars, for I promise you, I see not how to doo  it.
            
            
               Tertullus
               You must be sure to let none preach at Paules crosse, but they of whom you  haue experience to like wel of you, and you must giue them instructions before hand, that they do inuey mightilie against the reformation that our aduersaries desire, and there wil one or other of them speake against that, and so you may haue sufficient aduantage against them.
            
            
               Diotreph
               But these fellowes be very sharpe to  find a fault: What and if the matter

which our friend preacheth be false, & so the other take occasion to cōfute it?
            
            
               Tertullus
               Then must you vrge him to defende  that which he hath said, and so shal you haue more occasion to intrap the aduersarie.
            
            
               Diotreph
               But in so doing, he whome we set on  worke shall lose his credit.
            
            
               Tertullus
               What and if he do, do you compare  his credit with the waight of your Bishoprickes? There is no comparison.
            
            
               Diotreph
               You say true, but what if it shall fall  out, that the aduersarie be not blameworthy, neither in matter nor manner?
            
            
               Tertullus
               If hee maintaine the controuersie it  is sufficient cause to put him to silence though he haue the better part, for you must maintain the peace of the Church.
            
            
               Diotreph
               But this is not all, for how shall we do  for the courte, that is the place, which aboue all we must fortifie, or els we are gone?
            
            
               Tertullus
               Indeede there is great care to be had  of it, and there be many waies to preuent vs there, but we will doo what we can in it. First you must take heed from time to time, what chaplains be put to the queene, seing they are the teachers

of the whole court, namelie, that they be eloquent of toong, and good companions, not too precise in their conuersation.
            
            
               Diotreph
               It is very true, for they may els marre all, I haue heard some of them speake  dangerouslie, euen before hir Maiestie.
            
            
               Tertullus
               Therefore you must take heede, that  they be such as can be contented with the course of the worlde, and then if they happen to speake home nowe and then, as it is a thing incident vnto a rethoritian to be girding, the Courtiers will neuer regarde his words, because thee see hee walketh not according to that himselfe.
            
            
               Diotreph
               But I am afraid that the court shal in time come to knowlege by their preaching,  aod then we are gone.
            
            
               Tertullus
               Feare not that, I read once in a Book made by one nf the Puritanes, that if a  man woulde haue the blessing of God (as he termed it) vpon his hearing, hee must submit him selfe to an ordinarie teacher, which thing I promise you is somewhat: for I see, that the greatest knowledge of their religion, as in those

places, and men, that haue that same ordinarie teacher, and therefore keepe them from any more preaching, than one sunday in the moneth, and that by diuers men, and I warrant you that gappe is stopped for euer.
            
            
               Diotreph
               It is something that you say, & I will not forget to looke vnto it, but there  is an other thing which is greater than that, which is, how wee may keepe the Queene on our side, for I haue often feared her, seeing (there is no question) but she is grounded in the foundation of religion.
            
            
               Tertullus
               Howe haue you kept in with her all this while? 
            
            
               Diotreph
               Marie thus, we haue bene verie carefull to take heede who be admitted to  preach before her in the Lent: There was one Deering, that by our negligence preached, if he and such as hee, hadde but continued the whole Lent, I am afraide, there would haue bene neuer a lord Bishop left in England before the next Lent had come againe.
            
            
               Tertullus
               That I like very well, but that is not all, they wil make books, and it can not  bee but some of them doo come to hir

hands, how wil you do if she like wel of them, and the matter of Discipline in them?
            
            
               Diotreph
               I promise you I cannot tel, you must help vs that dead lift, or els wee are vndoone. 
            
            
               Tertullus
               It is an easie matter to remedie, you must when you heare hir speake of such  things, make hir beleeue that all is wel, and that the drift of these men is not seene, for they would haue no magistrare, and so would pull downe Kinges and Princes, and this wil be sure to preuaile, and make them to be esteemed the vilest men aliue.
            
            
               Diotreph
               Howe can I tell hir that all is well, when I haue bin constrained to tell diuers  Preachers, that haue so sore vrged mee with the text, that I coulde wishe things were amended, but the Q. will not at any hand?
            
            
               Tertullus
               Surely, you are a very simple man (my Lorde) as though the Queene heares  what you say vnto them, or they, what you say to the Queene, you must still continue that course of excusing all things to hir, for shee beleeueth that you are learned, and lay all the blame

when you talke with them on hir: for you cannot ouerthrow them by Scripture, and so you shall not onelie keepe the Q on your side, but also make the Preachers haue a tollerable opinion of you, that you would haue some thinges reformed if it lay in you.
            
            
               Diotreph
               That is a notable way, I will alwaies obserue and practise that, but there be  many Noble men, Counsellers, greate courtiers that seeme to like well of our aduersaries: how shall we do to retaine them, or to bridle them that are gone from vs?
            
            
               Tertullus
               That will be some what hard to doo: yet the best counsell I can see meete to  be taken, is this: you must shewe your selues very affectious vnto those that desire glorie and estimation, you must winke at the vices of all of them whatsoeuer they be, and not reproue them, much lesse correct them, and those of them that be needie, you must haue them to beg the Bishopprickes, Deanr
                     •
                  es, and such great places, & let them that shall haue them pay well for them. So shall you not onelie haue them beholding vnto you for a benefite, but

keepe them still on your side, in hope to haue the like bootie an other time.
            
            
               Doitreph
               This is very well, and shal be always  obserued: but there is yet an other thing I heard of late, that there be verie manie Gentlemen and Gentlewomen in the Court that like vs not, and it hath often times bene, that Kings and Princes haue beene induced by information of meane menne, to doo that which great Counsellours coulde not be at into their heads, how shall we do to stay the mischiefe that may come of these?
            
            
               Tertullus
               Easilie, you must consider that they be of two sortes, either they be such as  be highly in fauor, or they be common courtiers: if they be of the former sort, you must when you haue oportunitie to speake to hir, tell hir, that she must take heede of such, and such persons: for though they be verie wise and discreete, because you must not dislike anie that shee liketh, yet are they (being of a good nature) deceiued, by the faire pretence of Puritans, & for them, you must saye they doo greate harme, by reason of their countenaunce in the

court, with fauouring the Puritans, so that it shall come to passe, by these informations, that the Queene shall not onely reiect their speeches (if they vse any against you) but also take them vp roundly, that they shall not dare to speake any more.
            
            
               Diotreph
               This pleaseth me at the verie heart, but how shall wee doo to be sure in the  counsell table, for they are wise, and many of them like vs but from the teeth outward, and wee haue receiued many a foile there?
            
            
               Tertullus
               That is euen the hardest of all: I know not in the whole world any way  but one.
            
            
               Diotreph
               Tell me that one, for if once I know it, we wil say well to it but we wil bring  it to passe.
            
            
               Tertullus
               This is it: in King Edwardes dayes, there were Bish. of the counsell: now if  you could get, though it were but one to be a counseller, then might hee verie well, whensoeuer any matter of complaint came, tel the lords it pertained to ecclesiasticall iurisdiction, and he & his brethren woulde heare it at large: so might he stop their mouthes quickelie,

and then hee might for fashions sake heare the cause, but send the plaintifes away with a flea in their eare. And thus very quickly woulde all complaints to the counsell cease.
            
            
               Diotreph
               Oh moste notable deuice, all our  friends in England shal faile vs, but we wil haue this take place: there is yet an other thing that must be helped, and that is the vniuersities, for they haue great priuiledges, and Puritans start vp there euery day.
            
            
               Tertullus
               So there will do some, doo what you  can, vnlesse you haue a fire and a fagot, which weapon of ours, you only lacke, and none but it: the best course that I knowe to be taken is this, let no Colledge choose his owne head, but let him haue a Mandamus, procured from the Queene, and see that he be such a one, as hath bene a non resident before, and let him haue diuers liuings: and so that will draw with it formalitie. Let him be the Q. chaplaine, or at the least broght nowe and then to preache in the Lent, and that will so set hym a gog for a Bishopricke, that you shall be sure he wil suppresse your aduersaries as they arise,

and let the heades of the houses be admonished from time to time, that they choose none to be fellows that be Puritans, but such as like the estate, and for the more assurance, let them be vrged to subscribe, yea to sweare to your authoritie, before they be admitted.
            
            
               Diotreph
               Shall we go by Cambridge, & see this  put in execution as we go?
            
            
               Tertullus
               Nay soft, be sure of the court, before  you enterprise any other where, least you marre all.
            
            
               Diotreph
               You say very wel, nowe how shal we  doo for the parsons and vickars, of the country that like vs not?
            
            
               Tertullus
               I promise you those that be in already,  will saye harde vnto you, and those that be to come also, if they will subscribe to the articles, so far as they cō
                  cerne faith and sacraments, the statute law fauors them too much.
            
            
               Diotreph
               But haue wee no helpe by the cannon  law?
            
            
               Tertullus
               Yes, there is helpe inough in the cannon  law, if they will take it: but I will tell you one thing in your eare, which I would not for a thousand pounds were knowne abroad, and that is this: if the

statute made in the 28. of H. oct. cap. 19 and the reuiuing of it in the 1. of Elizabeth cap. 1. were thorowlie sifted, I am afraid, not any cannon law woulde be found good lawe in England, and so what would become of you, and your aucthoritie? But I know to whom I do speake it.
            
            
               Diotreph
               What shall we do then? 
            
            
               Tertullus
               You must set a good face vppon the matter, and pretend law, both statute,  and cannon, especially cannon, bicause they know not that they depriue them of their liuings, which if you (though they know you do them wrong) could remedy it by law, yet are not their purses so wel filled as yours, and so lacke of liuing will make them to yeelde at length, as we see it hath done many.
            
            
               Diotreph
               But may we not wel suppresse them,  for not vsing the surplice, and booke of common praier in all points?
            
            
               Tertullus
               I tell you there is no law in England  to hurt them, for any thing that they haue done concerning the surplice, the iudges hauing beene set on by you, and vs, haue indited them for it, but it is more than they canne warrant by law,

and as for the booke it is cleare, that the strickt keeping of it was meant against vs, but we thanke you for turning the edge to them from vs. Sumnaries must be your best helpe in this case, and looke that you practise it continuallie.
            
            
               Diotreph
               This wil do very wel, how shal we do to keepe the Ministerie from too much  knowledge, for that must bee doone, though we pretend the contrarie?
            
            
               Tertullus
               Indeede it is a thing that you must looke narrowlie vnto, and therefore  take heed aboue al things, that the exercises of prophesie come not vp again, for you know what harme they did vnto you in euery place where they were kept, and especiallie where men were moderators therein, that had bene beyond the seas, to see the practise of thē at Geneua, and you must beware of the exercises that ministers haue at their meetings: for you knowe, that in Leicester-shire, they furthered knowledge greatly.
            
            
               Diotreph
               But how shal we do with this, the exercise  of prophesie is expresly set down

in the 14. Coloss. 1. to the Cor. and it is knowne, that they whome you and wee set on worke to get it forbidden, confessed since that they knewe it not, but tooke it to be foretelling of things to come, and not expounding of the scriptures.
            
            
               Tertullus
               You must answeare it as you do the rest of their reformatiō, the particulars  where of are expressed in the new Testament: namelie, that they were things onely for the time, and for them that helped you, what if they conf
                     •
                  ssed their ignorance, you must still excuse their exercises to bee vnlawfull assemblies, and 
                     •
                  onuenticles to breede sectes and schismes, and your authority wil be are you out in all this and more too.
            
            
               Diotreph
               But what shall wee doo to make the world beleeue we woulde haue the ministerie  learned?
            
            
               Tertullus
               Make them first Ministers, and set them to schoole, enioining them to  g
                     •
                  t som part of M. Nowels Catechisme, or of Bullingers Decades by heart, and so you shall seeme to desire a learned ministerie, aswell as these reformers.
            
            
               
               Diotreph
               Wee will not faile to put this also in practize, is there any more that you knowe, that may serue our turnes, for the further establishment of our dignities?
            
            
               Tertullus
               No nothing of any great waight, but  it may be referred to some one of these points, but the particulars of euerye braunch are many, which your owne wisedome may easily looke vnto.
            
            
               Diotreph
               Then let vs go, for I long vntill I doo  set these things abroach.
            
            
               Tertullus
               Yet I pray you remember to do somthing  for vs poore Catholikes, seeing you stand by our help especiallie.
            
            
               Diotreph
               Great reason we should do so, or els  were we vngratefull creatures, but you must deuise what must be doone.
            
            
               Tertullus
               You know that some of vs be in prison,  and others abroad, for those that are restrained, I pray you that they may haue their libertie of the prison, and their friendes to come to them, and when any of them come before you, that you would deale fauourablie with them.
            
            
               Diotreph
               Your request is verie reasonable, for

the first you shal see that your friendes shall haue the best chambers in euerie prison, and when any Puritane falleth into our handes, you shal see him haue the most stincking place that can bee found. Now when any of you, yea if you your selfe come before vs, you must be content to let vs raile on you, & cal you traitor, & threaten you greeuously, but you shall be sure you shall sustaine smal harme, if you receiue any, you must impute it to the times and not to vs.
            
            
               Tertullus
               I thank your lordship, let vs now be  going, for we haue tarried too long in our lodging this morning.
            
            
               Diotreph
               Hee neuer tarrieth too long that is  wel employed, as we haue bene, it was the best morning that euer I spent.
            
            
               Demetri
               How now mine host, what say you to these iollie fellows, had not they notable  talke?
            
            
               Pandoch
               Yes sir, I haue learned of them, that that will doo me good I hope. 
            
            
               Demetri
               What is that? 
            
            
               Pandoch
               I haue learned howe to course our Preacher, and hee shall be sure of it,  and though it cost mee the price of a

tunne of wine.
            
            
               Demetri
               Why, what dooth he that deserueth  coursing?
            
            
               Pandoeh
               What? Hee setteth men together by  the eares, the towne was neuer at quiet since he came, he teacheth such doctrine as some doo like, and some not, and so they fall at variance.
            
            
               Demetri
               I pray you tell me some particulars of the worst of all. 
            
            
               Pandoch
               This for one: our towne standeth on  vittelling, because it is a thorow-fare, and he preacheth against good fellowship (which hee calleth drunkennesse) and against playing at cardes and tables, wherein if he might haue his will, I and my neighbors might go on begging within one twelue-moneths, and he hath so preuailed, that I take not so much by foure poundes in a weeke, as I was woont to doo: yea I haue had ten shillings of one man in a weeke for drincke onelie, that will nowe scarce spend three, but I will looke vnto him.
            
            
               Demetri
               Well mine hoste, deceyue not your selfe, I perceiue that you and I are in  a wrong boxe, you are an enimy to the

Preacher, because hee speaketh against your vnlawfull gaine, and so was I yesterday with him that tooke the same course to amend me: and I thought he had spoken falsly, because hee was a Puritan: and when I came to heare my matter debated, the bishop disalowed my course, and yet tooke my part. And why? Because I might defend him in his vnlawfull calling: But I see their ingling well inough, and if the man wyth whome I was so offended be not gone, I will talke further with him, for I perceiue that hee meant better vnto mee than they did.
            
            
               Pandoch
               I perceiue we shall haue a Puritan of  you, if you would so faine speake with him, hee is but newe gone out at the gate, you may ride after him: but as for our Preacher, I will in hande with him, because I cannot tell howe I shall else gaine and maintaine my selfe as heretofore I haue doone.
            
            Dixi.
         
         
            
            THE CONCLVSION.
            BRethren, ye see by lamentable experience, howe iniuriously the church of GOD in England is d
                  •
               al
                  •
               e withall, by taking away, and stopping the mouthes of their faithful teachers, and by thrusting vppon vs vnlearned, and vnsufficient menne, which neither haue wil, nor abilitie, with wholsome barking to driue away the wolfe, but 
                  •
               ontrariwise dooth giue priuie encouragement vnto the enemie, to continue in his wickednesse, whereby the churche of God is assailed most daungerouslie; and Sathan dooth not cease by all meanes possible to ouerthrowe that good worke which is begunne in England: and therefore it behooueth vs brethren to looke about vs, and not to suffer the ennemie to growe so strong against vs if by anie meanes wee may let and hinder his wicked enterprises. And now my brethren, what is to bee doone on our partes? Surely I am one of the simplest of a thousand, to giue aduise to proceede in any good course

in so waightie a matter. But this, in my iudgement were a good way, eueu to ioyne our selues together, so manie as feare GOD, and to frame our moste humble supplication vnto hir Highnesse, shewing vnto hir Maiestie the greate dammage and losse that the Churche dooth sustayne, for that they can not haue the voyces of their faithfull pastors, which haue diligently, and with great paines labored to drawe men backe from superstition, and the false worship of God, vnto the true and sincere worship of his maiestie, and laying downe before vs most purely, the doctrine of the Scriptures, to the end, that we shoulde know what wee ought to doo, and what to leaue vndoone, leading vs, as it were, euen by the hand, to the true worship of God, and our loyall dutie vnto her Maiestie, and al hir officers. And these men (we can not tell by what meanes) are letted and stopped from dooing those notable dueties of their calling, and are not permitted to speake anie more vnto vs in the name of the Lord,

whereby we hir poore subiects sustaine great dearth and scarcitie euen to the foode of our soules. Therefore wee hir loyall subiects, most humbly do entreate her Highnesse, that shee would looke vpon the affliction of the poore Church, and let vs haue our true teachers restored vnto vs againe. And so we hir subiects should yeelde continual thanks vnto hir highnesse, praieng vnto GOD alwayes for hir prosperitie. And (our brethren) if this way shall bee thought good, when there shal be some aduise taken vpon it. Then to choose out some fitte man that can indite and frame our supplication, one that feareth God, that hath a feeling of this plague in his heart (as the Scripture speaketh) I meane of the want & lacke of these good preachers.
            And this beeing doone, then to appoint other godlie and honest men, to present our supplication, two, or three, as it shall bee thought good vnto you, and the rest to aide them with money, or in what other daunger may fall out: so that they present it in the name of

the whole congregation, or otherwise, if it shal be thought good: first to moue our sute vnto some of the Byshops, as Winchester or Salisburie, or both, or anie other that you shall thinke good: I beseech you let vs not sit still, when wee are touched so neer, but as those good men haue ventured their libertie and liuing for our good: so let vs take some paines for them, to aduenture some daunger of reproofe, or what else may fall out.
            Better is the day of death (saith Salomon) than the day of birth, man that is borne of a woman, liueth but a shorte time, and is replenished with many miseries, but happie are the dead, that die in the Lord.
            Man is borne of woman in trauel, to liue in miserie, man thorough Christ doth die in ioy, and liue in felicitie. Hee is borne to die, & dieth to liue. Straight as he commeth into the worlde, with cries, hee vttereth his miserable estate, straight as he departeth, with songs he praiseth God for euer. Scarce yet in his cradle, three deadlie ennemies assault

him: after death no aduersary can anoy him: whilest hee is heere, hee displeaseth God: when he is dead, he fulfilleth his will. In this life, heere he dieth thorow sinne, in the life to come, he liueth in righteonsnes, thorough many tribulations in earth, he is still purged: with ioy vnspeakable, in heauen is he made pure for euer: heere hee dieth euerie houre, there hee lyueth continually: heere is sinne, there is righteousnesse: heere is time, there is eternitie: hecre is hatred, there is loue: heere is paine, there is pleasure: heere is miserie, there is felicitie: heere is corruption, there is immortalitie: heere we see vanitie, there shall wee beholde the maiestie of God, with triumphant and vnspeakable ioye in glorie euerlasting.
            Seeke therefore the things that are aboue, where Christ sitteth on the right hand of God the father, to whom with the sonne and the holie ghost, be al honour and glorie, worlde without ende
            Amen.
