                     GOD whych of hys singuler
goodnesse (as the sage philosopher
Hermes hath plainly
discribed) to each of his creatures
hath added a reasonable
soule, which is the chiefe
and most excellent treasure that any man
can be indued withall: Let vs then consider
gods inerplycable benefits alwaies
of his owne free wyll (and not of our desertes)
geuen and bestowed vpon vs, and
sith that the soule of man is of great estimation
in his fatherly presence, let vs endeuour
our selues to walke, that by continuall
exercise of vertuous and holesome
documēts, I meane not onely by hearing
of the sincere veritie: neither yet by much
talkyng of the same to heare, and not to
bear awaye is altogether friuolous: To
babble and prate much of Christ and hys
gospell (as though we would be counted
ghostly gospellers) & to wante the chefest
thing, I meane the frutes o

                  for his deny them wyll.
                  Sith Christ in heauen will them forsake,

FYrst the learned
this arte
of witchcraft
at the age of .xii.
yeres of hyr grandmother
whose nam
was mother Eue
of Hatfyelde Peuerell
disseased.
                     Item when shee
taughte it her, she
counseiled her to renounce
GOD and
his worde, and to
geue of her bloudde
to Sathan (as she
termed it) whyche she delyuered her
in the lykenesse of a whyte spotted
Catte, and taughte her to feede the

sayde Catte with breade and mylke
and she dyd so, also she taughte her
to cal it by the name of Sathan and
to kepe it in a basket.

                     
                     When this mother Eue had geuen
her the Cat Sathan, then this Elizabeth
desired firste of the sayde Cat
(callinge it Sathan) that she might
be ryche and to haue goodes, and he
promised her she shoulde, askinge her
what she would haue, and she sayde
shepe (
                           •
                        or this Cat spake to her as she
confessed in a straunge holowe voice,
(but suche as she vnderstode by vse)
& this Cat forthwith brought shepe
into her pasture to the nūber of .xviii

blacke and whyte, whych continued
wyth her for a tyme, but in the ende
dyd all weare awaye she knewe not
howe.
                     Item when she had gotten these
shepe, she desired to haue on Andrew
Byles to her husband, which was a
man of some welth, and the cat dyd
promyse she shold, but that he sayde
she must fyrste consent that t
                           •
                        is Andrew
shuld abuse her, and she so did.
                     And after when this Andrew had
thus abused her he would not mary
her, wherfore she willed Sathan to
waste his goodes, which he forthwith
did, and yet not beyng contentid
with this, she wild him to touch
his body, whych he forthewith dyd
whereof he died.
                     Item that euery tyme that he did
any thynge for her, she sayde that he
required a drop of bloude, which she
gaue him by prycking herselfe, sometime
in one place & then in an other,

and where she pricked her selfe there
remayned a red spot, which was styl
to be sene.
                     Item whē this Andrew was dead,
she douting her selfe with childe willed
sathan to destroye it, and he bad
her take a certayne herbe and drinke
it whych she did, and destroyed the
childe forthwyth.
                     Item when she desyred an other
husbande, he promysed her an other,
naminge this Frauncis whom shee
nowe hath, but said he is not so rich
as the other, willynge her to consent
vnto that Frauncis in fornycation
which she did, and therof conceaued
a daughter that was borne within a
quarter of a yere after they were maried.
                     After they were maryed they liued
not so quietly as she desyred, beinge
stirred (as she said) to much vnquietnes
and moued to swearing and cursinge,
wherfore she willed sathan her

Cat to kyll the childe, beinge aboute
the age of half a yere olde and he did
so, and when she yet founde not the
quietnes that she desyred, she wylled
it to lay a la
                           •
                        enes in the leg of thys
Frauncis her husbande, and it did in
this maner. It came in a morninge
to this Frauncis shoe, lying in it lyke
a tode, and when he perceiued it puttinge
on his shoe, and had touched it
with his fote, he being sodenly amased
asked of her what it was, and she
bad him kil it, and he was forthwith
taken with a lamenes wherof he can
not healed.
                     After all this when shee had kept
this Cat, by the space of .xv. or xvi.
yeare, and as some saye (though vntruly)
beinge wery of it, she came to
one mother Waterhouse her neyghbour
(a pore woman) when she was
going to the ouē, and desired her to
geue her a cake, & she wold geue her
a thing that she should be the better

for so lōg as she liued, & this mother
waterhouse gaue her a cake, where
vpon she brought her this cat in her
apron and taught her as she was in
structed before by her grandmother
Eue, tellig her that she must cal him
Sathan and geue him of her bloude
and bread and milke as before, and
at this examination woulde confesse
no more.

xxix. daye of Iuly.
Anno. 1566.
                  
                     
                        Mother Waterhouse.
                     
FYrste (beinge
redi prepared
to receiue her
death) she confessed
earnestly that shee
had bene a wytche
and vsed suche execrable
sorserye the
space of .xv. yeres,
and had don many
abhominable dede,
the which she repē
                     ted
earnestely & vnfaynedly,
and desyred
almyghty God
forgeuenes in that
she had abused hys
most holy name by

her deuyllishe practyses, and trusted
to be saued by his most vnspekeable
mercy. And being demaunded of the
by standers, shee confe
                        •
                     sed that shee

                        •
                     ent her sathan to one Wardol, a neibour
of hers, beinge a tayler (with
whō she was offen
                        •
                     ed) to hurte and
destroy him & his goodes. And this

her Sathan went therabuot for to
haue done her wyll, but in the ende
he r
                        •
                     turned to her agayne, and was
not able to do this myschiefe, she asked
the cause, and he aunswered because
the said Wardol was so strong
in fayth that he hadde no power to
hurt hym, yet she sent hym dyuerse
and sundry time (but all in vayne) to

haue mischeuid hym. And being demaunded
whether she was accustomed
to go to church to the common
prayer or deuine seruice, she saide yea
& being required what she dyd there
she saide 
                        〈◊〉
                      did as other women do,
and prayed right hartely there, and
when she was demanded what praier
she saide, she aunswered the Lordes
prayer, the Aue Maria, and the
belefe, & then they demaunded whether
in laten or in englyshe, and shee
sayde in laten, and they demaunded
why she saide it not in engly
                        ••
                     e but
in laten, seing that it was set out by
publike aucthoritie and according to
goddes worde that all men shoulde
pray in the engly she & mother toung
that they best vnderstande, and shee
sayde that sathan wolde at no tyme
suffer her to say it in englyshe, but at
all tymes in laten: for these and many
other offences whiche shee hathe
commytted, done and confessed shee

bewayled, repented, and asked mercy
of God, and all the worlde forgyuenes,
and thus she yelded
vp her sowle, trusting
to be in ioye
with Christe
her sauiour, whiche dearely had
bought her with his most
precious bloudde.
