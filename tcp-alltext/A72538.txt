            TO THE RIGHT
HONOVRABLE SIR
Thomas Parry Knight, one of his
Maieſties moſt Honourable priuie
counſell, and Chanceller of his Highnes
Dutchie of Lancaſter, together
with the Right vertuous & Religious
Lady his wife, grace
be multiplied in this world,
and glory in a better.
            
               Right honourable,
            
            IF (as the Pſalmiſt ſaith) The Lord
hath ſo doone his maruellous
workes that they ought to be had
in rememberance, and are much
ſought out of all ſuch as feare him:
pardon me in your honourable patience,
while I preſſe with paſſion ſuch prodigies,
as haue fallen out of old in former
times, and now of late in theſe moderne
daies of danger wherein we liue. All harbingers
of Gods Irefull wrath and indignation

for mans tranſgreſſion; And
yet I know not how, (which is a wonder
of wonders) ſignes from heauen, are not
respected, ſinnes on earth are not repented
for. We can diſcerne the face of the
skie, like the Iewes in the Gospell taxed
by our Sauiour, and thereby we dare prognoſticate
of the effects of faire or foule
weather to come, but we cannot diſcerne,
either by ſignes from heauen, or prodigies
on earth, how the Lord is riſon out
of his place, and threatneth our deſtruction
if we repent not.
            The meditations hereof, I am bold to
put vnder the ſhelter of your honours
protection, and pray they may paſſe your
iuditious eye, in ſort as they are tendered,
that is, from the dutie and ſeruice I owe
in many rspects, being otherwiſe vnable
to anſwere the ſame, but in ſuch paſſages,
of prayer and religious exerciſes as fall
within the compaſſe of my profeſſion. And
ſurely ſuch paſſages are beſt ſuted to your
ſelfe, whom religion hath made honourable,
and worthy thoſe great and waightie
imployments you haue vndergone abroad
in forraigne parts, and at home within

the kingdome, vnder two religious Princes.
            Beſides, ſpare me to ſeeke protection at
your honours hands, in regard of the place
you beare with vs, vnder God and the
king, our worthy Chancellor, the ſterne of
which gouernment you haue moderated
for many yeares, with ſuch iuſtice, mixed
with mercy, as I dare appeale to your clemencie
and milde cenſure, in any thing I
haue here tendered.
            And for the latter Sermon, which is
the Perfume of prayer, (the Arrow of
our deliuerance in the daies of danger)
I truſt it ſhall not be offenſiue, if I make
it proper to the Elect Lady, your religious
wife and conſort, whoſe practiſe of
much pietie, with prayers and teares
(Church-weapons,) haue beene, are and
will be a bleſſing to your houſe, and an ornament
to the Church of God, whilſt
Anna-like, ſhe frequents the Temple &
houſe of God, treading vpon that holy
ground, with no leſſe due, then true deuotion.
            And now the Lord Ieſus, as he hath
matched you together in grace, and giuen

you much honour, with length of daies,
espouſe you to himſelfe in the kingdome
of glorie, that you may come to the feaſt,
and mariage of the Lambe, crowned with
glorie, and clad with immortalitie, enſignes
of a better world, whither Chriſt
is gone before and hath traced you the
way to follow after: which becauſe you
haue faithfully done, he will come and
fetch you to himſelfe in a time accepted,
that where he is there may ye alſo be. Againſt
which day and bleſſed houre, the
Lord God of heauen prepare you, with
your oyle and your lamps light, that ye
may meete him in the cloudes, and ſo be
caught vp to raigne with him for euermore.
Amen. Amen.
            
            
               Your honours moſt humble,
and at command,

            THE DRVM OF
DEVOTION.
            Striking out an Allarum to
Prayer, by ſignes in heauen and
prodigies on earth.
            
               ACTS II.
               
                  19 And I will ſhew wonders in heauen
aboue, & tokens in the earth beneath,
bloud, and fire, and the vapours of
ſmoake.
                  20 The Sun ſhalbe turned into darkenes,
and the Moone into bloud▪ before that
great & notable day of the Lord come.
                  21 And it ſhalbe, that whoſoeuer ſhal cal
on the name of the Lord ſhalbe ſaued.
               
            
            
               VPon the reading of this Scripture
propheſied of by Ioel, applyed
by Peter, and to be accō
                  pliſhed
in the latter daies, me thoght

I heard the Lord ſpeaking from heauen,
as hee did by another Prophet,
and ſay;
               Habacuk▪ 2. 2 Write this viſion, and make it
plaine vpon Tables, that hee may runne
that readeth it, for the viſion is for an
appointed time, and at the laſt it ſhall
ſpeake and not lie, though it tarry, waite,
for it ſhall ſurely come and not ſtay.
            Now, what it is that ſhall come, and
 not ſtay, is the ſubject of my ſpeech,
and the diviſion of my Text. There
 ſhall come ſignes and wonders in
the latter dayes to provoke our repentance;
there ſhall come faith and
confidence to all the godly, to aſſure
them of deliverance, and to this end
are wonders wrought, as in heauen
aboue, ſo in the earth beneath, bloud
and fire, and the vapour of ſmoake,
that the dampe of our ſinnes might
be put out by the breath of our Saviour,
whoſe preſence wee may be aſſured,
then preſſeth neere vs, when
theſe his wonders are vpon vs.
            If Kings of the earth ſtirre, the
commons are moved; ſhal the King
of heauen riſe either to bee iudged,

or iudge the world, and ſhal the creatures
ſit ſtill? ſurely no, for though
we his reaſonable & religious creatures
bee ſilent in our ſinnes, and
ſay nothing, yet ſhall the ſenſeleſſe
creatures grieue and grone after a deliverance,
I ſay deliverance from the
bondage of corruption, wherin they
are, and from the dampe of ſinne,
wherewithall they are peſtered. Of 
theſe in order as God will. And firſt
of prodigies provoking our repentance:
next of the ſweet perfume of
prayer, aſſuring vs of deliverance,
when feare and fire ſhall fine vs for
our good; for it ſhall bee, that whoſoever
ſhall call vpon the name of
the Lord ſhall be ſaved.
            What may be the meaning of the
ſpirit in this place, touching the
time and manner of theſe ſignes,
when, and how they ſhould appeare
to the worlds wonder, divers haue
diuerſly divined: 1. Some ſay the
accompliſhment ſhould bee at the
ſecond comming of Chriſt to judgement,
and bee harbingers of that

dreadfull day: 2. Others, for it
ſhall bee at the ſiedge and ſacking
of Ieruſalem by Titus and Veſpatianus:
of which opinion the Greeke
Paraphraſe is, which citeth Ioſephus
writing thereof: 3. Some ſay,
the accompliſhment ſhould bee at
the death of Chriſt, and in the
day of his paſſion, when all the
world ſhould bee paſſionate for
him, but not with him, for hee muſt
tread the wine-preſſe alone. Laſtly,
and the leaſt in reputation of iudgement
are the Iews, who euen at this
day vnderſtand it to bee meant of the
warres of the Iſraelites, with Gog and
Magog, Ezechiel, 38. 39.
            But that I ſeeme not more opinatiue
then orthodoxall, I may
ſafely ſay with the precedent words
of my Text, that theſe ſhall bee
accompliſhed in the latter dayes,
which are alwayes taken for the
dayes of Chriſt, when with the
effuſion of his bloud hee will power
out the abundance of his ſpirite
vpon all fleſh, and withall ſhew his

wonders from time to time to a
ſenſeleſſe world, ſenſeleſſe of it Sauiour,
ſo as from the firſt day of his
comming in grace, to the laſt day
of his appearance in glory, wonders
ſhall appeare, more or leſſe,
to the comfort of the godly, and
confuſion of the wicked.
            And ſurely, it is reſpectiue to ſee,
how ſparing the Lord is of his judgements,
and how plentifull in his mercies,
his bloud and ſpirit are powred
out in al abundance, his ſigns & prodigies
are but ſparingly ſhewed, and
pointed at, as harbingers of his wrath
to moue vs to repētance, bloud ſhed,
ſpirit powred out: O bottomleſſe
depth of mercy! ſignes but ſhewed,
and prodigies but pointed at, limitting
both feare and fire that it fall
not vpon vs before we repent, there
was never mercy either met it on
earth, or matched it in heaven, and
therefore I know not whether I ſhal
more willingly admire his loue in
ſpending his mercies vpon vs, or his
vndeſerued fauors in prouoking our
repentance.
            
               
               David in the perſon of the faithfull,
and in a caſe nothing different,
mourneth over Sion with this
wofull complaint,Pſal. 7 46. 
               Wee ſee not our
ſignes, and there is no Prophet left, but
Lord how long?
            
            Where it is to be obſerved, that
they doe not complaine, becauſe
they haue no Captaine to lead them
in the field; but that they haue no
Prophet to inſtruct them in the
faith: accounting it a greater calamity
to lacke the heauenly food,
then the earthly fight: nay more,
and to come neerer the proper
Subiect I haue in hand, theſe Saints
in Sion ſorrow not for that they haue
no Enſignes to follow on earth: but
becauſe they haue no ſignes ſhewed
them from heauen, to aſſure them
of the Lords preſence to fight their
battels, and be propitious, deeming
it more diſaſterous to faile of ſignes
about then of Enſignes below; where
propheſie is not, there the people
periſh: and where neither wonders
from heaven wound vs to repentance,

nor tokens below provoke vs
to prayer, we are in danger, and die in
our ſecurity.
            
               Are not all things as they were in the
beginning: ſo ſaide a ſecure world in
the dayes of Peter, muſicke, mirth,
and minſtrelſie were in their feaſtes,
velvet, ſilke and ſables were on their
backes, their coffers were full of ſiluer,
gold and pearle, their diſhes
were filled with dainties, their garners
with graine, their ſtawles with
fatlings, and their Orchards with all
manner of fruit, their gardens and
fields diaperde with all variety of
fruites, they felt neither ſinne within,
nor ſorrow without, no wonders
in heaven aboue, or tokens in the
earth beneath, bloud and fire, and the
vapour of ſmoake were vnneath
ſeene, and therefore no marvell if
they put farre away the evill day, and
ſuncke in their ſecurity.
            When Iſrael was full, then ſhee
kicked againſt the Lord, and her ſin
increaſed as the ſignes decreaſed, til
tokens from the Lord had taught

her another diſcipline, the vapour of
ſmoake blaſted her garland, when it
was at the greeneſt, famine, ſword, &
fiery Serpents, brake her heart to better
obedience, and the Lord was mercifull
vpon their repentance.
            VVe thinke it goeth well with vs,
when our waters keepe the courſe
of their wonted Channels without
inundations, when the North is clear
and light without fiery inflammaons,
when neither Sunne nor Moon
laboureth of an Eclipſe, we deeme
the day bleſſed, when the ayre is
pure, and the windes are ſtill, when
the ſeas are calme, and no thunder
breaketh the cloudes; yet better it
were if thunder-clappes from aboue
did breake our hearts, and prodigies
below plowed them vp for a
ſofter mould, againſt the day of
harueſt, when the Lord ſhall come
in the cloudes, with his fanne in the
one hand to winnow all, & fire in the
other hand, to purge all; the corn for
heaven, and the chaffe for hell.
            
               Moabs reſt, was Moabs ruine: and

ſurely, I could never yet ſee, but the
world that flattereth vs, is more
dangerous then the world that perſecuteth
vs, according to that periculoſior
mundus blandus quam moleſtus: It
was ſaid of David, by one who ſaide
well, factus eſt ſecurus devictis hoſtibus
praeſſura caruit tumor excrevit:
When he had no fight hee fell from
his God, and the proud tumor of his
luſt, the leſſe it was handled, the more
it rankled.
            The doctrine is good for the generall,
and ſo I will deſcend to a more
particular vſe of ſigns, & it may be to
ſhew that he can be mercifull without
means, the Lord will ſometimes
be ſilent, & ſhew no wonders, but paſſe
vs like the ſweet running waters of
Shiloh, that goe ſoftly by Sion, but
when it pleaſeth him for our loude
crying ſins to come in judgement,
then wil hee ſwell like the turbulent
waters of Iorden that run roughly, thē
wil his ſigns & wonders bee harbingers
of his wrath, warning vs of his
neare approch, ready to deſtroy, if we
repent not.
            
               
But to worke a certainety out of
ſuch wonders as the Lord hath
wrought, either by himſelfe in th
                  •
               
old Teſtament, or by his Chriſt in
the new: It is to be obſerved, that ever
vpon his comming to a worke
of judgement, or a worke of mercy,
there hath gone before him a commotion
of Creatutes to preſent his
preſence; for as I haue already ſaide,
If when Kings of the earth ſtirre, the
people are moued; ſhall the God of
heaven riſe from his reſt, and the
creatures ſit ſtill? I ſay, ſit ſtill before
his preſence, in whoſe voice
there is feare, and in whoſe face there
is fire,Heb. 12. 19. 
               for even our God is a conſuming
fire.
            
            When the Law ſhould bee divulged
from the holy Mount, the Lord
came from Sinai,
               Deut. 33. 2. 
               and roſe vppe from
Seir vnto them, and appeared clearely
from Mount Paran, and he came with
ten thouſand of Saints, and at his right
hand a fiery Law: the ayre thundered,
the hils trembled, burning, blacknes
and darkenes were his pauilion, and

ſo terrible was the ſight which appeared,
               Heb. 12. 21
               that Moſes ſaid, I feare and quake: It
was a great day, fearefull and fiery,
becauſe of a fiery Law; what maruell
then, if vpon the approch of ſo great
a majeſty, the earth ſhooke, & the
heauens dropped at the preſence of
this God,Pſal. 68. 8. even the God of Iſrael.
            
            What ſhould I ſay more of Iſraels
God, ſith at the brightnes of his
preſence, the red ſea was diuided, &
Iorden was driven backe, Quailes
fell from heaven, and the Rocke
guſhed out water ſprings, the ſunne
ſtood ſtill in Gibion, and the Moone
in the vally of Aielan: Surely, ſurely,
at the preſence of this great God, the
heauens and the earth ſhall ſhake, but
the Lord will be the hope of his people.
               Ioel. 3. 16.
            
            But leaue we them elder dayes, &
come we to the later times mentioned
in my Text; Nay, leaue we that
God of Majeſty, and come we to the
God of mercy, euen to the dayes of
Chriſt, who, when hee bowed the
heauens, and came downe into our
fleſh, though hee fell vpon vs like a

ſhower of rain vpon a fleece of wooll
in ſofnes and in ſilence, yet the heavens
were ſhaken at the brightnes of
his preſence, whē at his birth Angels
ſung his lullaby, and at his death, all
the creatures of God mourned his
funerals.
            To tel of the prodigies that fell out
at his birth, and of the wonders that
were then ſeene, I will bee the more
ſparing to ſpeake, becauſe out of holy
Writ little can be ſaid thereof; yet
if approued hyſtories may ſpeake, &
Chronacles of elder times, may bee
admitted for Records of truth, that
bleſſed Babe, euen in his birth, by
ſignes and wonders was approved to
be the vndoubted ſon of God, the
Meſſias and Saviour of all the world.
It cannot be denied which holy Writ
averreth, Fulget in terris lux nova de
coelo, And another ſtar appeared at
his birth, and Angels were heard to
publiſh his prayſes with glory in heauen,
peace on earth, and good will among
men; yea, and to attend the
preſence of that bleſſed Babe, Kings

came from farre to offer their gifts,
Kings of Arabia and Seha they offered
of their pureſt gold, and ſweeteſt
perfume; that which the ſhepheards
heard from heauen keeping their
flockes vpon the downes of Bethlehē,
they preached to mē vpon this earth,
and all theſe are holy wonders of holy
Record, ſhewing fignes from heaven
vpon the approch of that bleſſed
birth, whoſe breath, as ſome write,
blew open the doores of that great
Pantheon at Rome, I mean the Temple
of all the Gentile gods, who vpon
the birth of Chriſt fell down & brake
their necks, as Dagon did before the
Arke. I might tell how Divels were
daunted at his comming, eſpecially
when the time of his appearance drew
neere, and I will here onely mention
two Oracles of Apollo concerning
this matter, one to a Prieſt, and the
other to a Prince.
            A Prieſt of Apollo demanding him of
true Religion & of God;Suidas in Thulis. anſwere was
made out of the hollow vault, O vnhappy
Prieſt, why doeſt thou aske

me of God, that is the father of all
things, and of this moſt renowmed
Kings, deare, and onely ſonne, and of
the ſpirit that containeth all; Alas,
that ſpirit will enforce me ſhortly to
leaue this habitation and place of
Oracle.
            The other Oracle was to Auguſtus
Caeſar,
               Suidas in vita Anguſti. euen about the very time of
Chriſts birth, who deſirous to know
who ſhould raigne after him, would
needs goe to Delphos, and withall
learne what ſhould become of things
when he was dead; to which Apollo
for a great ſpace would make no anſwere,
till Caeſar had importuned
him from ſacrifice to ſacrifice, till he
came to the great Hecatomb: whē as
it were enforced, Apollo vttered theſe
ſtrange words vnto him; An Hebrew
Child that ruleth ouer the bleſſed Gods,
commandeth me to leaue this habitation,
and out of hand to get mee to Hell; but
yet do you depart in ſilence, from our Alters:
Whereuppon the Emperour
ſtanding agaſt, and muſing with him
ſelfe what this anſwere might bee,

returned to Rome,
               Niceph. l. 
                     •
                  . and built there an
Alter in the Capitol,Hyri. c. 17. with this inſcription,
Ara Primogeniti Dei, by both
which you may ſee how Diuels were
enforced to leaue their habitations
on earth, vpon Chriſt his dwelling
in our fleſh; his Incarnation was their
execution, and they were enforced to
howle & vtter out their own miſerie.
When it pleaſed him to ſwaddle vs in
his mercy, and ſo with this merciful
myracle of our Sauiours birth, went
the miraculous mercies of our deliverance
from ſinne, death, and diuels:
his bleſſed birth being attended
vpon, as haue ſaid, to the wonder
of al the world, with theſe ſigns from
aboue, and tokens below, harbengers
of his moſt glorious and royal preſence.
            From the wonders of his birth, it
followeth wee came to the wonders
ſhewed at the death of Chriſt, when
vpon the effuſion of his bloud, there
was a cōmotion of all creatures high
and low, in heauen and on earth, all
grieued and groned to ſee and behold

ſo dolourous a ſpectacle: The
Sunne was darkened, and the Moone
became bloudy, ſtars fell from heauen,
and the earth quaked, rockes
burſt aſunder, and Sheal was ſhaken;
nay more, it was a day of darkeneſſe,
covering all the land as with a curtaine;
when heaven was ſhut from it
ſhine, and the graue was ſhaken, when
that Kingdom of death and darkenes
was conquered by Chriſt, whereby
his death killed death, and by his life
gained vs life with immortality: nay
more, was it not a wonder to ſee how
the vayle of the Temple rent, when
mens hearts would not relent: In a
word, the foundations of the earth
were out of courſe; and what had
that righteous one done?
            Surely, ſurely, though the prodigies
be paſt with the paſſion, & tract
of time hath vayled it from our fleſh,
that wee ſee it not, yet can it never
from a paſſionate faith, that it feele
it not: for to this end hath God giuē
vs the ſpirit of prayer and compaſſion (as
ſaith another Prophet) that we ſhould

weepe becauſe of him whom wee haue
pierced,
               Ezech. 12. but woe is me to tell who is
ſorrie for the afflictions of Ioſeph the
yron of ſorrow, entered into the
ſoule of our Sauiour, & we are ſenſeleſſe
of his ſufferings, if man will not
be moued, thou earth, ye rockes,
graues, Sunne, Moone, and Starres,
pleade the cauſe of the Innocēt, and
ſay, what hath the righteous done?
Innocēt hands whom haue ye ſpoyled?
and yet are ye perced? Innocent
heart, againſt whom haſt thou Imagined
euill? & yet art thou gored? Innocent
mouth, of whom haſt thou
ſpoken euill? and yet art thou ſpunged?
gracious face, & coūtenance, vpon
whom haſt thou lowred, and yet
art thou ſpit vpon? head full of
deawe, and lockes with the drops of
the night, ſo wooing vs in grace,
& now wedding vs in glory, how wer
thy temples crowned with ſharpe
thornes, to the effuſiō of thy blood?
and yet are we ſenſeleſſe of thy ſuffering?
we haue ſinned, and he hath
ſmarted, the Iuſt for the vniuſt, and

if we will be ſilent ſtill and ſay nothing,
to cleare the innocent, Sunne
Moone and Starres, earth Rockes
and Graues, will pleade the Lords
quarrell, and ſay, what hath the righteous
done? When the man of God
came out of Iudah vnto Bethell,
               1. King. 13. 2. and
Ieroboam ſtood by the Altar to offer
Incenſe, in reprehenſion of the kings
Idolatrie, he cryed againſt the Altar,
by the commandement of the Lord
and ſaid; Altar Altar, thus ſaith the
Lord: Vbi alloquitur aram molliorem
carde Ieroboam, where and when he
ſpake to the Altar ſofter then the
heart of Ieroboam.
            
            The heard harted Iewes then, and
we now, ſtand by the croſſe of Chriſt,
as Ieroboam did by the Altar at Bethel
we are ſadned in our ſinnes, and
ſenſeles of the ſorrowes of our Sauiour,
the earth, ſtones, & graues, are
more paſſionate then we, they tremble,
breake and open, at the death of
Chriſt, our flintie harts are ſhut from
all compaſſion, and we are a people
of no bowels, and becauſe we relent

not, euen now the teares of the
clowdes are in their eyes, and they
drop downe ſhewres of raigne in
greater abundance then vſuall hath
beene ſeene, as more paſſionate then
we, either for the ſins of our ſoules,
or death of our Sauiour.
            
               When I am lifted vp an high, ſaith
Chriſt, then will I drawe all men after
me, and not men onely, but earth,
Stones and graues ſhall open vnto
me, woe is my heart, we are heauier
then earth, harder then Rockes,
more ſilēt then the graues, we ſpeake
not, we pray not, we praiſe not, we
ſtirre not, at the death of our Redeemer,
he is lifted vp higher then euer
he was, euen from the croſſe of
ſhame to the crowne of glorie, and
we are pulled downe to all ſhame and
Ignonimy with the weight of our
ſinnes; heauier then a tallent of
leade.
            If any man ſay, ſhewe vs his ſufferings,
and we will greeue with him,
and for him, I anſwere, Dominus in
monte verbum in alto, Chriſt is vpon

the mountaine of his holines, his
word is exalted here and elſewhere in
the land, for what doe we preach
other then Chriſt Ieſus, and him
crucified? And doth it drawe all men
after it? The vaile of this Temple,
theſe ſtones in the pillars, this holie
ground and dead graues ſhall ſtand
vp in iudgement one day againſt this
people, that they haue beene more
preſt to heare, & paſſionate to feele,
of the preaching, piercing and ſufferings
of Ieſus Chriſt, then the men of
this generation; for we haue piped
vnto you out of the Goſpell, and ye
haue not danced, we haue mourned
vnto you out of the Law, and ye
haue not lamented. But when wiſdome
is iuſtified of her children,
then ſhall ye finde it no wiſedome,
but extreme madnes and folly, to
haue haunted the Tauernes, followed
your pleaſures, prophaned the
Sabaoths, ſold Chriſt at a lower rate
then euer Iudas did, not for thirtie
pence, but for a penny ſhot, a goodly
price whereat he is valued, and euen

then alas, when Chriſt is in
preaching and agonizing ouer the
cuppe of bitter affliction; Nay, the
Queene of the South ſhall ſtand vp
in that great day, ſo ſhall the men of
Niniuie, and the one ſhall condemne
vs, in that they repented more ſpeedily,
and the other that ſhe came
more readily to heare the wiſdome
of Salomon, then euer yet we did, to
heare the wiſdome of Chriſt.
            The vſe is good, of all I haue ſaid, to
ſtrike a Selah with our ſoules, in caution
of our former & future ſinning,
procuring prodigies, ſignes, and
wonders, at Chriſt his death, and our
redemption, for if one ſin of Achan
endangered all the campe, and if one
ſinne of Dauid plagued all Iſrael, what
maruell then, if when all the ſinnes
of all the world lay ſo heauily vpon
our Chriſt, and preſſed him downe
to death, there was a commotion of
all the creatures of God, to ſee and
behold ſo dolorous a ſpectacle: as
when the ſonne of God gaue his
ſacred ſoule, a ſacrifice for our

ſinnes, who had no ſhelter but in the
graue, for that opened to giue him
paſſage, when the vaile of the Temple
rent, and denied him ſanctuarie.
            And now ſpare we a while to paſſe
from theſe prodigies at Chriſt his
birth, and death, to the wonders were
wrought ſithence, euen downe to
our diſaſterous daies, whereby we
may gather the neare approach of
Chriſt his ſecond comming to iudgment.
The thought wherof ſo frighted
Iob in his frailtie,Iob. 14. 13. that he wiſhed
the graue might be his couer, till the
griefe thereof was paſt.
            
            I might tell of that great day, and
it was the Lords day, when hee
mightily declared himſelfe to be the
ſonne of God, by the reſurrection
from the dead, and what maruell
then, if vpon the approach of ſo glorious
a preſence, Sheal was ſhaken,
graues were opened, and dead bodies
did riſe with him, and appeared vnto
many in the holy citie, to the great
wonder of all the world. And I might
tell of that great day, and it was the

Lords day, when at that high feaſt
of penticoſt, the holy Ghoſt appeared
in a viſible ſigne, and was powred
downe from God, and fell vpon
his Apoſtles in ſo great abundance,
what maruell I ſay, if vpon the approach
of ſo powerfull a ſpirit, and
preſence, ſounds from heauen, filled
their eares like the ruſhing of a
mightie wind, fiery clouen tungs filled
their eyes, and mouths, to ſpeake
magnalia dei, to all nations vnder
heauen, I ſay what meruell if feare
with an aſtoniſhmēt filled their eyes,
eares and hearts, when the Lord was
about a worke of ſo great wonder,
I leaue theſe holy wonders to the
leaues of holy writ, wherein you are
daily exerciſed, and by your holy
patience I will follow the ſtreame of
ſome ſuch ſignes as ſithence haue
fallē out, ſhewing a preſence in God
prepared to puniſh, without paſſion
in man to preuent the danger by
ſpeedie repentance.
            Memorable is the deſtruction of
Ieruſalem by Tytus and Vespatian, 40.

yeares after Chriſt his painefull
paſſion, who prophecied of their
ruine, becauſe they repented not, nor
did, or would know the day of their
viſitation, ſhe would acknowledge
no preſence of the Lord in mercy,
and therefore muſt feele the preſence
of her God in iudgement, yet
not without prodigies, ſignes, and
wonders, as harbingers of his wrath;
whereof Ioſephus writeth much,Lib. 7. and
more then I can now ſtand to relate,
Cap. 12. being preuented with time, but
reade his booke de bello Iudaico, and
there ye ſhall find▪ how firſt, a blaſing
Starre was ſeene in the ayre like vnto
a ſword hanging ouer the Citie, for
more then a whole yeare together,
threatning nothing leſſe then fire
and deſolation, for their bloodie
ſinnes, the blood of the Prophets,
and of that Iuſt one, crying vengeance
to God in heauen, againſt
that bloodie Citie.
            2. Againe, at the feaſt of vnleavened
bread in a great aſſemblie of
people, and at nine of the clocke

in the night, a bright light was
ſeene in the Temple ſhining, and
ſo continued for the ſpace of halfe
an houre, In token, that becauſe
they had quenched the holie lamps,
and put out the light of the world,
therefore the glorie of that houſe
ſhould be of no continuance.
            3. Thirdly, at the ſame feaſt,
and in the day time, when the High
Prieſt was offering an Heyfer for
the Sacrifice, ſhe brought foorth a
Lambe in the midſt of the Temple,
In ſigne, that though they thought
they had killed that Lambe of God
that taketh away the ſinnes of the
world, and that Moſes ſhould ſtill
haue liued when Chriſt was dead,
yet ſhould they ſee with their eyes,
that the truth ſhould riſe out of
that type, and when the Heyfer was
ſlaine, yet the Lambe ſhould liue;
yea, and that very Temple, ſtones
and all, ſhould turne to Greet, Ne
populus redirit ad Iudaizmum, Leſt
the people might goe backe to Iudaizme.
            
            
               
4. Fourthly, nay yet more the
great Braſon doore as the Author
ſaith, being at the Eaſt end of the
Temple, which twentie men could
hardly either open or ſhut at the
ſixt hower of the night flew open of
it owne accord, ſhewing a new way
and paſſage of Chriſt, to a better
place and being, euen vnto a Tabernacle,
not made with hands, but
pitched in the high heauens, opening
of it ſelfe, without helpe of any.
            5. Together with theſe as Ioſephus
writeth in the 21. of May, a gaſtly
ſpirit, of an vnſpeakable height
and bignes was ſeene in the citie, a
pregnāt prodigie of their iminēt deſolation,
when Zim & Ohim, Skritchowles,
Fairies, & Satyres, did haunt
their houſes, and faireſt habitations.
6. Chariotes in the ayre & armed mē
fighting by troups amōg the clouds
appeared throughout al the Land of
Iudea, & marched towards the Citie
with fearce Encounters, all preſages
of their future fall, by the furie of
warre which was at their doores, and

yet they repented not. 7. Nay more, in
a ſolemn feaſt, when the Prieſts were
aſſembled by night, as their manner
was to ſacrifice, they heard this voice
Migremus hinc, migremus hinc, let vs
get hence, let vs get hence: the wonder
they heard ſell from heaven, enioyning
them ſilence, and a ceſſation
from all legall ceremonies and ſacrifices
now ended, both Prieſt, place,
and offering, vpon the ſole ſacrifice
of Chriſt, whom they had cruelly
murthered, and therfore had need to
be gone before the fire of his fierce
wrath was kindled againſt that place,
people and kingdome.
            Laſtly, and of all other prodigies
to provoke their repentance, vpon
the Lords preſence & neere approch,
now ready to ſtrike, it was not the
leaſt which fell out in one Ieſus, the
ſonne of Ananias, of the vulgar ſort,
who foureteene yeeres before the
ſiedge, & when al was in quiet, peace,
and plentie, this ſonne of Ananias
comming to the feaſt of Tabernacles,
when the manner was, that the Princes

of the people ſhould doe their devotions
to God in the Temple, ſodenly
he cried out to the wonder of
them all, A voyce from the Eaſt; a
voyce from the Weſt, a voyce from the
foure windes, a voyce vpon Ieruſalem,
a voyce vpon the Temple, a voyce vpon
the Bride, and vpon the Bridegroome, a
voyce vpon all the people: Thus night
& day he ran through euery ſtreet,
crying without thought of food, or
regard of any; inſomuch as when he
was beaten by the mighty (impatient
of the prodigie,) I ſay beaten to
the bare bones, he neither ſhedde a
teare, or ſhewed himſelfe ſuppliant,
but at euery ſtroke ſtil cried out, Wo,
woe, to the inhabitants of Ieruſalem;
and thus continuing during all the
time of the ſiege, and eſpecially at
their ſolemne feaſts: At laſt, when
the ſiege was at the hoteſt, running
round about the walles of the City,
without feare hee vttered the ſame
voyce, and ſaid, Woe to Ieruſalem,
was to the people, and woe to my ſelfe; At
which laſt woe, Sagitta ictus occumbebat,
               
wounded with an arrow, hee fell
downe dead.
            The vſe is good, and for vs in the
height of this our ſecurity, all theſe
wonders and ſignes, euery man interpreted
as the ſtory ſaith, Pro ſua libidine,
euen as beſt pleaſed himſelfe,
ſome they neglected, ſome they corrected,
ſome they contemned, donec
patriae exidin, ſua
                     
                        
                     
                     que
                   pernieie eorum iniquitas
confutata eſt, till their error with
their wickedneſſe was corrected, with
the deſtruction both of their country
and of themſelues, they killed
their Prophets, they beleeved not
Chriſt, whom when they had ſlaine,
and ſilenced, then was it time for
prodigies to ſpeake, and ſay, O bloudy
City, I dare giue remiſſion vpon
thy repentance, but I dare giue no
reſt vpon thy rebellions. Before the
deſtruction of Troy, as Virgil reporteth,
Fatis aperit Caſſandra futuris,
era Dei Iuſſunec vnquam credita Tencris;
Caſſandra foretold it ruine, but
could neuer be beleeved; ſhe ſpake
from the holy Oracle, but was not

heard: Its a fearefull thing when the
Prophets are deſpiſed; its more fearefull
when their Propheſies are ſet at
nought; but its fearefull aboue all
feares, when fire is a falling downe
frō heauen, that is, when we with our
Prophets and propheſying prodigies
ſpeake, and wonders worke, and yet
wee repent not: ſo it was with Iſrael,
I pray God it bee not ſo with England.
            
            To ſpeake of the ſignes, wonders
and prodigies that ſhall be ſeene
vpon the worlds ending; I dare not,
I cannot, that feare and fire oppreſſeth
my ſpirits in the thoughts thereof:
Et horret animus meminiſſe: my
very mind and ſoule melteth at the
heat thereof. And therefore hauing
in ſome weake meaſure mentioned
that dreadfull day heretofore in two
other Sermons, I leaue it vnder a
vayle, as Apelles did the imperfect
portraiture of Agamemnon, father of
Iphigenia, and come a little neerer
home, euen downe to our dayes.
Haue we no ſignes in heauen, or prodigies

in earth, to moue our repentance?
Haue not the heavens of late
yeeres ſtrucke an alarum to provoke
our prayers by vncoth ſignes, never
ſeene before.
            It is ſome 40. yeeres agoe ſince
that ſtarre in the North appeared in
Caſſi
                     •
                  peia, whereat the Aſtronomers
ſtood agaſt: Surely, it was ſome ſtar
of Bethlehem, conducting vs to that
Babe of Bethlehem, Non in cunis; ſed in
Cathedra, not lying ſwathled in the
cratch, but advanced into his chaire
of high eſtate, by a ſecond birth of
holy doctrine thē divulged through
out all the world: when the Goſpell
ſhould beget faith in more abundance,
from the Eaſt, to the Weſt, by
North, and by South. I durſt not thus
preſage of the effect of this ſtar, were
I not well warranted by the judgements
of two worthy Divines, lights
of this age, Du Pleſſis and Beza:
who by that wonder in heauen, are
bold to ſay, that the Lord hath prognoſticated
a ſecond birth of Chriſt
vpon the earth, by the preaching of

the Goſpell vnto all nations vnder
heaven, neuer to bee backed by that
wicked man,2. Theſſ. 2. 8. 
               whom the Lord ſhall conſume
with the ſpirit of his mouth, and ſhal
abolſh with the brightneſſe of his comming,
whereof theſe wonders in heauen
are warnings on earth for all
Gods children to bee prepared with
our oyle, and our Lampes light to
meet him in the cloudes, and ſo to
bee caught vp to raign with him for

                  •
               ver. And ſo to the next.
            Not many yeeres after, and right

                  •
               ppoſite to that in the North, there
appeared an other wonder in heauen,
a blazing ſtarre both great and
fearefull, threatning ſome dangerous
event to the Southerne parts of the
world, which the Affiricans in ſome
meaſure felt, when the Kings of Barbary
and Portugall were ſlaine. The
cinders of that ſtarre yet kindleth a
combuſtion in the hearts of the two
Kings of Marocco and Fez, nor is
the flame extinct in Spaine, but yet
burneth in the breaſt of Sebaſtians
blood, againſt that of Caſtile. And

ſurely, it may bee a warning to all
Chriſtian Kings and Princes of the
world, to ſtir vp their zeale, and melt
their coldnes to fight for the chriſt

                darke Saturday, neere hie noone,
at what time vſually the Sun giueth
out his faireſt ſhine, a ſodaine darkneſſe
was over all the land, and ſo
fearefull, as men were at their wits
ends, panted in ſoule, left off al ſecular
care, & betook them to their beſt
prayers, not knowing what would be
the Iſſue, till the Lord againe, and
ere wee thought vpon his mercy, remoued
the judgement. In token of
our intollerable neglect of the light
of his Goſpell, whereof that gloomy
day was a ſure Sacrament, taxing

our dim ſight with his ſharpe cenſure,
that becauſe for a long ſeaſon,
the light had ſhined in darkenes, and
the darkenes comprehended it not:
he could if hee would remoue the
candleſticke, candle and all, and put
out the eye of faith, as hee had dearned
the light of heauen. Nay more,
and aboue al, I haue ſaid to make the
prodigie yet of greater wonder; it
was obſerved by many, how during
the darkenes of the day, all thinges
were huſht, and ſo ſtill, as leaues ſtirred
not, beaſts fed not, birds ſung
not, but ſtood agaſt as if they had
beene filled with aſtoniſhment.
            And you know how not long after,
this darke day, the light of Iſrael
was put out fot a time, Queene Elizabeth
died, a dearne day to England,
had it not beene preſently repayred
with as cleare a light from
Scotland, in whoſe Sunne-ſhine now
wee walke, and ſing ſtill with ſolace
the Songs of Sion in our owne land.
It may be ſo ſodaine a darkenes preſenlty
relieued with ſo great a light,

was a Symball or Sacramenr of our
Soueraignes, dead and liuing; two
peereles Princes, both relieued with
their deſired lights; Hee of Englands
honour, Shee of heavens glory;
yea, and we their Subjects delivered
from that dark and dangerous night
of Queene Elizabeths death, by the
ſpeedy ariſing, & luſter of that morning
ſtarre, our Soveraigne Lord the
King, whoſe day wee pray, may euer
dawne. It may bee ſome ſharpe ſight
may cenſure me in the applying of
this darke day, to the death of Queen
Elizabeth: yet dare I ſay, and I hope
with good warranty, that when godly
Kings and Princes die, Quid ni mundus
ipſs defleret eum principem eſſe rapiendum
per quem duramundi iſtius rē
                  perari
ſolerent; So ſaide Ambroſe of
the death of Theodoſius: Why may
not this worlde deplore ſuch a
Prince to bee taken away by the
violence of death, as by whome
the dangers and difficulties thereof
haue beene moderated.
            Nay, hee proceedes further,

and nearer the point I ayme at:
Hoc nobis motus terrarum graves,
hoc iuges pluviae minabantur, & vltra
ſolitum caligo tenebroſior denunciabat,
quod clementiſſimus Imperator Theodoſius
receſſus eſſet è terris: This
the great Earthquakes wee haue
felt, with the continuall raine wee
haue had, and a more palpable
darkeneſſe than vſuallie we haue
ſeene, haue denounced and threatned,
that Theodoſius a moſt milde
and mercifull Emperour ſhould depart
this world.
            You are religiouſly wiſe to diſcerne
of what is ſaid: when Chriſt
ſuffered, the Soueraigne of all Soveraignes,
there was a commotion
of all the creatures: All were
moved to ſee and behold ſo dolorous
a ſpectacle. Earth quaked,
rockes riued, the Sunne was darkned,
and the Moone became
bloodie, Starres fell from Heauen,
there was blood, fire, and
the vapour of ſmoake, before that
greate and notable day of the

Lord came. And what was Ieſus of
Nazareth, other then a King, then
conquering our enemies for a better
world? And what was Theodoſius?
Queene Elizabeth with all of their
rancks and Religion, leſſe than
Princes in his ſtead, to tule in this
world: And why may not the creatures
of God condole alike vpon
their diſſolutions?
            Next, it will bee remembred
whiles Chronicles can ſpeake, how
the earth was bound by a prodigious
froſt, to Londons wonder, when
Thames was paved for cart and
carriage, for horſe and man, able
in one day to ſupport a waight
of wonder, and vpon the other
diſſolved into weake Water. It
pierced deepe into the bowels of
the earth; and to this day, the
flowers, hearbes, plants and trees,
(nay more, man and beaſt, fiſh
and fowle) haue not recovered their
decayed ſtrength, but yet feele
the effects thereof; all to warne vs
of our chillerie zeale to God, more

colde then the Iſickles hanging
at our doores: and ſtrange it is,
that ſo many Sunne-ſhines as
haue beene ſince, and ſhowers of
Gods mercies ſtill powred vpon
vs, ſhould not melt our frozen
hearts to more ſpeedy repentance,
and provoke vs to prayer, with more
deuotion.
            I paſſe by many ſtrange Eclipſes,
both of Sunne and Moone, more
frequent and vniuerſall than haue
been of old: darkeſome ſun, bloody
Moone, prognoſtications of our
dearne light, and dead life in the
Goſpell of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt:
wherein with thoſe glorious lights,
the Sunne of righteouſneſſe ſeemes
to bee vayled, as with the cloud
and curtaine of our ſinnes: Alas,
and woe is mee therefore, wee are
fallen from our firſt loue, wee
worke not, wee ſhine not as wee
did in the dayes of perſecution,
when fire and fagot fined vs for our
God.
            And the late inundations with

vnſeaſonable weather in their extremities,
as of cold, ſo of heate,
windes and tempeſts, are nothing
leſſe then prodigies of an irefull
God, to tell vs of the deluge of
our ſinnes,Gen. 7. 20. that of the old world,
ſwelling but 15. cubits aboue the
higheſt hils: this reaching from
the nethermoſt hell to the higheſt
heavēs. The crie of our ſins, reacheth
the heavens, and euen there worketh
our woe, by turning them this yeare
into braſſe, to make the land barren,
and the next yeere diſſoluing
them into teares and ſhowers, dropping
downe for fatneſſe, death and
dearth: Quicquid id eſt timeo, whatſoeuer
it is, I feare our rebellions
againſt God, will make a commotion
of all his Creatures againſt vs,
both great and ſmall, Elements
and all; never ſo much diſtempered
as of late yeeres, that a man
would thinke (but that God hath
promiſed, That Summer and Winter,
               Gen. 7. 22 
               and the ſeaſons, ſhall uot ceaſe ſo
long as the earth remaineth) the very

foundations of the earth to be out of
courſe, and which is more and worſe
then all I haue ſaid, the armie of our
ſinnes may bring vpon vs an hoſt of
men from a far country, & of a fierce
countenance, to tyrannize ouer vs, as
it fell out oftē with the Iewes: as may
be obſerued in all the courſe of the
ſcriptures, ſtill as they ſinned, God
raiſed vp euer & anon one forraigne
power or other to chaſtiſe them, till
at lēgth the whole armie of their ſins
ioyned in one, that is to ſay, come to
the height of all impietie, called frō a
far country, an other armie, euen the
fierce Romanes, who brought vpon
them a final deſolation. And haue we
no reaſon to feare the Romaniſts?
hauing ſo many of them alreadie in
our boſomes, ſwarming in all places
of the land, neuer more bold & cōfidēt
then at this day: As I ſaid before,
ſo I ſay againe, quicquid id eſt timeo, I
ſay no more. And ſo much out of my
loue and loyaltie to God, my Prince
and countrey, as a watchman, and by
vertue of my calling, I may be bold

to ſay, for Res eſt ſolliciti plena timoris
amor. Loue is full of fearefulnes. Nor
is it leaſt in obſeruance, though laſt
in ſucceſſion, which fell out in the
Northerne parts of this kingdome,
in Aprill laſt, and in the pariſh where
I dwell, and haue my paſteral charge,
witnes fiue hundreth more beſides
my ſelfe, who beheld with aſtoniſhment
that fearefull ſpectacle. To wit,
a dead childe, baſe borne, of lewd parents,
hauing foure leggs, and foure
armes, all out of the bulke of one bodie,
with fingers and toes proportionable:
which bodie had two bellies
and two nauels forward, with one
plaine backe,Buried at Standiſh Church in Lancaſtſhire Aprill. 17. 1613. without ſeame or diuiſion,
it had but one head, and that
of a reaſonable proportion, with two
faces, the one looking forward, and
the other backward: either face had
two eyes, two eares, a noſe & a mouth
perfect, nor was there in the ſeueral
members thereof, any blemiſh or
diſproportion ſaue in the moulding,
the ſexe was female, and the mother
was deliuered but halfe an houre before

this ſtrange birth of a perfect
womā childe, which was baptized at
our Church and yet liueth. To preſage
what may follow, I cannot, neithere
dare I, leſt I ſeeme diſaſterous;
onely let it tax our miſhapen liues,
ſo farre degenerate from the ſimplicitie
of the old world, wherein
both virginall and coniugall chaſtitie,
were prized with honour, where
now with many it is almoſt diſhonourable
to be honeſt. Iudah with
Thamar left his claoke, to verifie his
luſt, but Ioſeph with Potiphers wife loſt
his cloke to vilifie his luſt. Many Iudaes,
fewe Ioſephs in theſe adulterous
daies, wherein men doe rather ſolace
themſelues, then ſorrow for that
ſinne, of which I may ſay, Lex Iulia
dormis? Nay Lex Iehoua dormis, O
thou law of God? why ſleepeſt thou?
The many legges and armes may tax
our vntollerable pride, and aueriſe,
reaching heere, and treading there
yea in robbing well nere all Gods
creatures, to fil the belly & cloath the
backe, with coſtly and gariſh ſutes,

madding the minde, and making bodies
monſtrous, might Iacob and Rahel
riſe out of their graues, to behold
their children that tread vpon them,
they could not but deeme them of
a monſtrous birth. Two mouthes
taking in, & two bellies caſting out,
taxe our inſatiable deſire of belly
cheere & drunkennes, exoticall ſins,
and neuer but of late, a ſtaine to this
Engliſh Nation, In philtris philiſtinorū
               
Sampſon fell, Et Ebrietas decepit quē
Sodoma non decepit, Wine made him
ſinfull, whom Sodome could not deceiue.
Laſtly, two faces may taxe the
world of palpable hypocriſie, diuelliſh
deceit, & damned equiuocation:
Firſt, in vs Proteſtants whiles we ſay
we beleeue, and yet do not liue the
life of the Goſpel we profeſſe: wherein
we doe but Sophiſticate with the
Lord, & equivocate with his Saints:
for what auayleth it, a tōgue to ſpeake
well, with a mentall reſeruation to do
euill? Next, it may ſeeme to taxe the
damnable doctrine of our Romiſh
equiuocators, who are double faced
to deface all truth, and to deſtroy all

commerſe both with God and man,
whiles they ſay, Dafallere, da Iuſtum,
ſanctum
                     
                        
                     
                     que
                   videri, Lord giue me to deceiue,
and yet that I may ſeeme a
Saint. Pyrrus & Vliſſes, as you may
read in Sophocles being ſent to Lemno
                     •
                  
               
to take from Philoctetes Hercules his
arrowes; The two Legats aduiſed,
by what meanes they might beſt
wreſt them out of his hands: Vliſſes
affirmed, it was beſt to doe it by lying
and deceit: Pyrrus anſwered no, I like
not of that, becauſe I neuer vſed it,
but alwaies loued the truth as my father
and Anceſtors haue euer done.
Wherunto Vliſſes replyed, ye when he
was a yoūg man he was of that mind:
but now being old, he had learned
by long experience, dearely bought,
that the ſureſt way & beſt art in mans
life, is, Fallere & mentiri. Many of this
age are of Vliſſes minde, eſpecially
the Ieſuited crue of damned equiuocators:
but true borne Iſraelites are
of Pyrrus ſpirit: (great is the truth &
preuayleth, is the ſweete poeſie of
their profeſſion, both in themſelues,
friēds, & families) yea & they reſolue

vpon the doctrine of their maiſter
Chriſt, that the truth ſhal make them
free: As alſo Quod non patitur ludum
fama, fides, occulus, that eyes honours
and othes, will not be ie ſted withall.
But to proceed yet further, and make
vſe of the prodigie, it is reſpectiue,
how when the Prince was dead this
birth was borne, It was in the Autum
of the yeare, when Prince Henry that
ſweet bloſſome was blaſted, with the
dampe of our ſinnes, and ſo as with
this faire flower, fell all the flowers of
the field, leaues of trees, and Roſes in
our garden, they would not flouriſh
while Henry was a falling, but fel with
him. Woe vnto vs that euer we ſinned,
ſo faire a Prince, ſo pious and ſo
puiſāt to fal in a day, was ſuch a ſtroke
as ſhooke the Cedars with the ſhrubs
and might yet well beſeeme our
ſacke cloth and aſhes: but this baſe
birth was borne in the ſpring following,
to tax vs, as with the growth
of our monſtrous ſinnes, ſo to teach
vs withall, that ſithence the faire feature
of a Prince ſo well faſhioned in

his life, was ſo ſoone forgotten in his
death, the Lord would tempt vs, with
a prodigious birth for ſo vnualuable
a loſſe: nor is it ſtrange a ſinfull people
ſhould be ſo threatned, becauſe
it is vſuall with God to puniſh our
pleaſures by contrarie paſſions, as he
did the daughters of Sion,
               Iſay. 3. 24. 
               when in
ſteed of ſweet ſauour: hee threatned a
ſtinke, and in ſteed 
                     •
                  f a girdle a rent, in
ſteed of brothered haire, baldnes: in
ſteed of a ſtomacher, a girding of ſacke,
and ſunburning for beautie: & why not
England, in ſteed of a Royal & religious
iſſue whereof we are vnworthie,
with a monſterous birth and miſhapen
broode, of that whore of Babel,
whoſe Romiſh faith and faction the
Lord he knoweth doth daily breed
euen in the bowels of the kingdom,
wherin there are but to many doublefaced,
double harted, and double
handed, fawning, ſtil vpon vs and
yet threatning our deſtruction, both
with eie, heart, and hand, could they
but gaine the opportunitie. I ſpeake
not this to diſmay any, but to charge

vs of vnthankefulnes: for yet we are
bleſſed with the hopefull iſſue of
moe Princes, and with many drops
of much royall blood, and by the
grace of God, this ſtrong gable of
ſo many cords, wil neuer be broken if
our ſinnes burſt it not, yet with this
caution, that we repaire the ruines of
this our late loſſe, with ſpeedie repentance,
and pray withall, that God
would eſtabliſh the remaine of our
religious hope, for his ſonnes ſake,
and Syons ſafetie.
            O but he hath left a deſolate court!
I anſwere, as Ambroſe did of Theodotius,
Non ſunt deſtituti, quos pietatis ſua
reliquit haeredes, they are not forſaken
or left deſolate, whom he hath left
heires and ſucceſſors of his princely
vertues, Religion, puiſſance, pietie,
and clemencie: the brightnes whereof
will ſhine to Gods glory, and Englands
honour, ſo long as Chronicles
can ſpeake, and bookes be opened.
            I might here obſerue as many moe
haue done, what preſages fell out vpon
the fall of this faire flower and

peereleſſe Prince, how the two glorious
creatures of God, both Sunne
and Monne were troubled, the Sunne
ſcarce ſeene of twentie daies before
his death, the Moone oppoſed with
a mightie Rainbowe, in the dead and
and darkenes of the night, bended
ouer that houſe of mourning where
he died. I might tell how the ayre,
earth, and clouds, ſeemed to be ſenſible
of his fall, and to condole his
death, whiles ſtrange windes, ſtorms,
and tempeſts, with continually ſhewers,
raignes, and floods. Many darke
daies, Clouds, and foggie miſts, were
vpon vs, to warne vs of our woe, as
formerly hath beene obſerued of
Theodotius and Queene Elizabeth,
before their deaths. Nor can I paſſe
without paſſion, what fell out in the
ſommer before Prince Henry died, at
Chattam. Where and when a ſwarme
of Bees knit vpon the maine maſt of
that Royall ſhip, he had made for
Englands defence, tellng vs, that ere
long Angels foode from heauen,
more ſweet then Hony, or the hony

Combe, ſhould fill the ſoule of this
Saint to glory and Immortalie: yea
and ſwarmes of Gods holy Angels
ſhould come downe to fetch him
from the maine maſt of this earthly
kingdome aboue the heauen of heauens,
there to raigne with God and
his Chriſt for euer. A bleſſed Bee dedeliuered
from the ſting of ſinne
and death, to the endleſſe glorie of
life and immortalitie, neuer to ſin
or die any more. Nay more then all I
haue yet ſaid,Amos. 3. 6. to make good that there
is not an euill in the Citie which the Lord
will not reuale to ſome of his Prophets,
that Prophet who preached in the
morning of his ſicknes pointed
from aboue at the period of his life,
when he vttered that text and truth,Iob. 14. 1.
               Man that is borne of a woman, hath but
a ſhort time to liue, and is full of miſerie.
It was powerfull in the preacher, and
paſſionate in the Prince, to bring
him to the thoughts of his mortalitie.
            And ſo my deare brethren, to conclude
and make vſe of all theſe fearefull

ſignes and prodigies, let all theſe
together ſtrike out an allarum to
praier and repentance, yea, and to
godly ſorrow, neuer to be repented
of: by the ſweet perfume and priuiledge
whereof, ſoules are ſaued, and
bodies deliuered from threatned
dangers. And not bodies onely, that
is to ſay, particular perſons, but ſtates
and kingdomes are preſerued from
all malice of the creatures, be they
neuer ſo implacable.
            
               Are there monſtrous and vntimely
birthes?
               1. Peter. 1. 23. 
               pray to be regenerate and
borne a new, not of mortall ſeede, but immortall
by the word of God, that liueth
and endureth for euer.
            Are there fearefull thunderclaps
making thy wild heart to ſhake like
the wildernes of Cades? ſtand in awe
and ſinne not: common with thine owne
heart in thy chamber, and be ſtill: ſay
withall, it is thou Lord onely, that
makeſt me dwell in ſafetie.
            Are the Sonne and Moone eclipſed
deficient in their light, darke and
bloodie? The foole chaungeth like the

Moone; So ſaith Siracides; and thou
art changeable ô Chriſtian, when
by the motion of Gods ſpirit, thou
begins to be religious, and by and
by falles to be ſacriligious, Sacriligium
creatori committitur dum imbecillitas
aſcribitur creaturae.
            
            And therefore its not the Moone
that laboureth for her light, but its
thou that laboureſt in thy ſinnes,
its thou that chaungeſt like the
Moone.
            O if I might ſay, we fooles chaunge
like the Moone, for ſhee ſhortly
returnes to her fulnes: we fooles
linger our conuerſation.
            
               Illa velociter colligit quod amiſerat lumen:
tu nec tarde fidem recipis quam
negaſti: The Moone doth ſpeedily
gaine againe her light, that ſhe hath
loſt, we fooles doe hardly in any
time recouer the faith we haue denied.
            What ſhould I ſay more: Luna
defectum luminis patitur; tu ſalutis:
The Moone ſuffereth but the loſſe
of her light, thou of thy ſaluation.

               Grauior ergo tua quam lunae mutatio.
More dangerous therefore by much
is the eclipſe of thy ſoule, than is
the eclipſe either of Sunne or
Moone.
            But it may be ſome man will ſay:
doth neither Sunne nor Moone labour
in the eclipſe, doubtles they
doe, and that continually. For we
cannot denie but they labour with
other creatures, as the Apoſtle ſaith,
and grone with vs, alſo trauelling in
paine together, vnto this preſent, deſiring
the day of their deliuerance out of the
vanitie of corruption, wherein they are.
Leaue off therefore to looke vpon
the defects of thoſe glorious
lights, vnles thou looke vpon
the ſtaines and blemiſhes of thy
wicked life. For how is it poſſible
for the drunkard in his wine,
the wanton in his luſt, or the couetous
man in his wealth, to looke
vpon the Moone, and ſee the things
that are in heauen, when he knoweth
not rightly how to vſe or diſcerne
of things that are on earth?
            
               
Are there new Stars vncoth and
vnknowne? Doe they blaze in the
heauens and moue thee to wonder,
what may be the effect? Say with the
Sages, and then art thou wiſe, vidimus
ſtellam eius in oriente, &c. wee haue
ſeene his Star in the Eaſt, and are
come to worſhip him: him, not it:
leſt any man might bake cakes, to
the Queene of heauen, & adore the
creature, for the Creator. Yet follow
it till it come to the place where the
babe is: then leaue it, and offer of
thy Gold, Myrrhe, & Frankencence:
that is, when theſe ſignes in heauen,
& prodigies on earth, haue brought
thee to the ſenſe of thy ſinne, and
ſight of thy Sauiour, offer vp the
ſweet perfume of thy praier & praiſe,
an euening and morning ſacrifice
vnto thy Chriſt.
            Laſtly, are there rumors of warres
abroad in the world, or warres at
home, woes and wonders, euen at
thy doores, Hannibal ad portas, Is the
enemie at thy gates? Are the Barbarians
abroad, and is the Turke in

armes? Vibrans haſtam in Chriſtianos,
breathing after Chriſtian blood: deſine
peccare & ciuitas non peribit, ceaſe
to ſinne, and the citie ſhall not be ſacked.
Quid fugis patriam ſi vis ſaluus
eſſe tua potius peccata ſubter fuge ſi tu
peccare deſeris victus eſt inimicus. Why
leaueſt thou thy country? nay rather
if thou wouldeſt be ſafe, flee from
thy ſinnes, if thou leaue off ſinning
the enemie is conquered. And how
is he conquered? Non Gladio Golias
ſed lapide, proſternitur: Goliah was not
ſlaine with a ſword, but with a ſtone
out of a ſling: that is to ſay, by powerfull
praier. For ſo ſaith Dauid, thou
commeſt to me with a ſword, and with a
ſpeare, and with a ſhield, but I come to
thee in the name of the Lord of Hoſts
whom thou haſt rayled vpon.
            
            And thus you ſee how the Drum
of deuotion, in the hand of Gods
creatures, (though ſenſeles of themſelues,
yet ſenſible of our ſinnes)
hath ſtroken an allarum to praier.
Now let vs ſmell to that ſweet perfume,
and preſſe both the power and

priuiledge thereof to ſaue, out of
theſe words: It ſhall be that whoſoeuer
ſhall call on the name of the
Lord ſhall be ſaued. But becauſe I
haue wearied you ouermuch in
this, I will ſpare both my ſelfe and
you till a further opportunitie. And
ſo let vs pray: O eternall God and
moſt mercifull father, &c.
            The end of the firſt Sermon.
         
         
            
            THE SECOND
Sermon.
            THE PERFVME
OF PRAYER.
THE ARROWE OF OVR
deliuerance in the daies of danger,
when ſignes from heauen, and Prodigies
on earth, are on vs to
moue our repentance.
            
               Acts. 2. 21.
               And it ſhall be, that whoſoeuer ſhall call
vpon the name of the Lord, ſhall be
ſaued.
            
            SIgnes in heauen, and prodigies on
earth (as I haue told you,) are nothing
elſe but drums of deuotion,
prouoking our prayer, in the ſweet
perfume whereof, whiles we walke,
the Lord will either deliuer vs from
deſerued iudgements, or giue vs
patience to abide the fyrie triall,
And therfore pardon me yet further

to ceaze vpon your religious eares,
and hearts, on Gods behalfe, and in
tender of your ſaued ſoules. Pardon
me to preſſe you to powerfull praier,
thereby to make the Lord propitious,
ayding, & aſſiſting, when workes
of wonder, both aboue and belowe,
doe threaten our deſtruction.
            The wicked in that day ſhal wring
their hands, rent their garments,
teare their haire, and cry vpon the
mountaines to fall vpon them: but
the godly ſhall haue boldnes in that
day, they ſhall lift vp their heads, and
knowe that the day of their redemption
draweth neere: yea, & as it is in
my text, they ſhall call vpon the name of
the Lord, and be ſaued. I ſay, all ſuch as
feare God, ſhall feare no fire, but call
vpon the name of the Lord and be ſaued.
            
            Yet ſo, as the holy Ghoſt euer giues
the guſt, power, and ſpirit of prayer,
without which it is no perfume, but
a ſtinch in the noſthrills of the Lord
of Hoſt. And therefore as you may
here ſee the bleſſed Apoſtle clearing
the imputation of Drunkennes, both

in himſelfe, and the reſt his aſſociats,
euen in the height of that high feaſt
of Penticoſt, doth in ebriat the ſoules
of Gods Saints, with a pregnant propheſie
of the abundance of the ſpirit
which ſhould glad the hearts of
the godly in the latter daies. So then
I may ſafely ſay, that as the fire is
knowne by it heate, the Sunne by it
light, and the tree by it fruit, ſo may
you by prayer, know whether the ſpirit
of God be in you or no: As alſo
whether ye ſhall be ſaued when prodigies
are abroad, wonders in heauen
aboue, and tokens on earth beneath,
blood and fire and the vapour of
ſmoake. Much prayer, and much
paſſion, is euer from a powerfull ſpirit,
and it argueth a Royall preſence
of the holy Ghoſt for euen as: in water
face anſwereth face, ſo in plea of
ſaluation, ſpirit anſwereth ſpirit, Gods
ſpirit anſwereth our ſpirit, that we are
his children, yea and the inſence of
our prayer; anſwereth the perfume of
his ſpirit, in which ſweet ayre we are
carried and breath vnto ſaluation.
            
               
VVhy then it may ſeeme, where
there is much prayer, there is much
ſpirit; where there is little praier, there
is little ſpirit; and where there is no
prayer, there is no ſpirit; and if who
ſoeuer ſhall call vppon the name
of the Lord, hath much ſpirit, and
ſhall bee ſaved; it will follow that
whoſoeuer ſhall not call vpon the
name of the Lord, hath no ſpirit, and
ſhall not be ſaved.
            And I cannot but wonder, that
ſith the viſion is for an appointed
time, and now is the time (euen in
the latter daies, which are the dayes
of Chriſt) wherein God hath promiſed
to power out his ſpirit vpon all
fleſh, euen the ſpirit of grace and compaſſion,
ſo as euery one ſhould weepe apart,
becauſe of him whom they haue
pierced; And yet our praier ſhould
be ſo ſcanted, and our ſpirits ſo dull,
as wee ſeeme to bee dead in our deuotion.
Surely wee dire the Deity
with our ſinnes, wee quench the ſpirit,
wee grieue it; wee deſpite it, and
therefore wee pray not, becauſe the

ſpirit breathes not.
            Some few droppes of this heauenly
fountaine diſtilled vpon the
Patriarkes and Prophets of old, but
the cundits of grace were neuer ſo
fully opened as in theſe latter dayes
of Chriſt, when with the effuſion of
his blood, hee vented out the abundance
of his ſpirit, and powred it vpon
all fleſh; and is it not ſtrange thē,
that men ſhould ſo liue, as if they
ſtood in doubt, whether there bee an
holy Ghoſt or no; and in theſe laſt
dayes of mans redemption, they
ſhould breath more weakly, and pray
more faintly then in the firſt dayes
of the worlds creation; when Abel
was ſlaine by Caine; it is of ſpeciall
obſervation, that vntill the dayes of
Enoch, men were ſilent in their deuotion,
and cared not for their God, for
then as it is in the Text, men beganne to
call vpon the name of the Lord; Caines
ſinne had ſo corrupted Seths ſeed &
ſanctity, that till Enoch repaired the
ruines by his holy profeſſion, there
was little prayer, little ſpirit, litle pietie

in that world. It is ſaid of Enoch,
that hee walked with God, and was no
more ſeene:
               Gen. 5. 24. It was his ſpeciall priviledge
ſo to bee rapt vp, elſe moe had
followed after, but they wanted his
ſpirit, his prayer, and the familiarity
hee had with God; it was a bad world,
for the ſpirit breathed not, and therefore
men prayed not.
            
               When all fleſh had corrupted their
wayes, ſo as God looked down from
heaven, to ſee if there were any that
were good, and there was not one
good, no not one; then mans wickedneſſe
wallowed in the water of his
deſtruction; Noah prayed, and hee
was preſerved, the reſt called not
vpon the name of the Lord, and
therefore periſhed.
            I might tell of Abraham, Iſaacke,
Iacob, Moſes, Samuel and Ioſhua, how
plentifull the ſpirit was in them, and
how powerfully they prayed in their
dayes: yet from a ſparing ſpirit which
breathed but vpon few, beſides their
owne families. So might I ſpeake of
al the renowmed Kings of Iſrael, and

               Iudah; of inſpired Prophets, holy
men, and godly Matrones, down to
the dayes of Chriſt, all of bleſſed memory,
for feruent prayer, and frequent:
yea, and from a powerfull ſpirit:
yet limited to their peculiars,
and as it were confined within the
borders of Paleftine, till Siloh came,
meane our Chriſt, the Meſſias and Saviour
of all the world; who, as I haue
ſaid, with the effuſion of his blood,
powred out the abundance of his ſpirit
vpon all fleſh; I ſay with Zacharie,
the ſpirit of prayer and compaſſion,
that the godly might mourne,
becauſe of him whome they had
pierced.
            The Iſſue is ſweet, and the doctrine
is Orthodoxall, taken from
the practiſes of the godly in all ages;
neuer was it yet ſeen or heard,
that euer man prayed, preached, or
pray ſed aright, but as the ſpirit gaue
him vtterance. The holy Ghoſt is the
holie guide of all our holy actions, it
is the ſeaſoner of the ſoule, and the
moulder of all our ſanctity; it is the

mother of piety, and it openeth the
doore to all true deuotion; where it
breathes, there is the perfume of
Prayer; where it breathes not, there
is ſinne in ſilence, without cry or
calling vpon the name of the Lord,
that they might be ſaued.
            
               The creatures as it is in Paul, may
grone, wee may grieue and ſigh in our
ſelues, waiting for the adoption, euen
the redemption of our bodies,
in the ſalvation of our ſo ules: but
yet it is the ſpirite that helpeth our
frailety, and ſo, whereas wee know
not how to pray as wee ought, the
ſpirit it ſelfe maketh requeſt for vs,
with ſignes that cannot bee vttered;
for hee that ſearcheth the hearts,
knoweth what is the meaning of the
ſpirit, and he maketh requeſts for
the Saints, according to the will of
God.
            If the Apoſtles could haue tolde
how to haue prayed of themſelues,
they would neuer haue gon to Chriſt
to haue taken out the leſſon, nor ſaid,
Maiſter, teach vs how to pray: but

they knew that the holy Ghoſt and
he were all one, and therefore would
fetch that ſweet perfume from his
bleſſed breath, they knew that grace
was powdered in his lipps,Pſ. 45. 2. 
               becauſe God
had bleſſed him for euer.
            
            Well then I ſay no more but this,
to preſſe out this ſweete perfume
of prayer, to be practiſed of all with
vnwearied diligence. 1. That there is
an houſe of prayer, and the Lord
hath purged it. 2. There is a day of
prayer, and the Lord hath ſanctified
it. 3. There is an heart for prayer, and
the Lord hath poſſeſſed it. 4. There is
a mouth for prayer, and the Lord
hath opened it. 5. There is a preſident
for prayer, and the Lord hath enioyned
it. 6. There is a premiū
                or reward
for prayer, and the Lord hath giuen
it, euen ſaluation to out ſoules: for ſo
ſaith the text, It ſhall be that whoſoeuer
ſhall call vpon the name of the Lord ſhall
be ſaued, Nay & if none of theſe were,
yet becauſe we are fallen into the laſt
and worſt daies of the world, wherein
ſinne was neuer ſo ſinfull, deferued

iudgements, neuer more doubtfull,
nor Sathan ſo buſie to beſtir himſelf,
for that he hath but a ſhort time: It
might moue vs to be no leſſe feruent
then frequent in prayer, and the rather,
for that wonders, ſignes, & prodigies,
harbingers of Gods wrath are
vpon vs, yea Hanibal, ad Portas, iudgemēt
is at our doores: Oh, pray, pray,
pray, neuer more need to pray.
            But it may be ye know not how
to pray, and therefore ye aske and
haue not, becauſe ye aske amiſſe, ye
ſeeke and find not, becauſe ye ſeeke
amiſſe. For euery man ſeekes his
owne, either of pleaſure, or profit, but
fewe the things that are of Ieſus
Chriſt: and therefore ſpare me, while
I tender to your religious eares and
harts, a modell of prayer, where after
if you faſhion your deuotion, ye may
be ſure, both to haue audience, and
anſwere from the Lord.
            
                Wherein, firſt conſider the manner
how to pray, which is your preparation.
            
                Secondly, remoue the impediments

that hinder prayer, which is
your pollution.
            Thirdly, reſpect the incouragement,
ve haue to pray, becauſe of the
premium and rich reward which is
ſaluation: for it ſhall be that whoſoeuer
ſhall call vpon the name of the Lord
ſhall be ſaued.
            
            And firſt for the manner, how
muſt I call, that I may be heard? how
muſt I be prepared that I may make
the Lord propitious, and readie to
helpe in time of need? how may I
make him to returne my prayers into
my boſome, while I double my
plaints within my breſt?
            I muſt firſt call in faith, for without
faith it is not poſſible to pleaſe God: faith
is the ſalt of the ſacrifice that makes
it ſau
                  •
               rie: it is the Star guiding, it is
the piller of fire conducting, it is the
hand reaching, it is the ſpirit breathing,
a paſſion from vs more ſweete
then Incenſe in the noſtrills of the
Lord of Hoſt. In my faith I haue full
aſſurance that I ſhall be heard, anſwered,
& obtaine my deſires, for Chriſt

ſo promiſed when he curſed the barren
tree, and bleſſed the batſome
heart thus, Whatſoeuer ye deſire when
ye pray,
               Mark. 11. 24. 
               beleeue that ye ſhall haue it, and
it ſhall be done vnto you.
            
            And Iames the Sonne of thunder,
               Math. 21. 22. before
the call of praier ſent out the fire
of faith, like lightning, before ye clap,
when he ſaid,Iam. 1. 5. 
               If any man lacke wiſdome,
let him aske of God, which giueth to all
men liberally, and reprocheth no man, and
it ſhall be giuen him, but let him aske in
faith, and wauer not, &c. Yea & Dauid
was of this conſort,Pſ. 145. 18. when he ſung to
ye ſolace of his ſoule, The Lord is neare
vnto all that call vpon him, yea to all that
call vpon him faithfully. What ſhould I
ſay more, our faith is the victorie by
which we ouercome the world, it is danted
with no difficulties, it paſſeth for
no impoſſibilities, it extent reacheth
far, euen from the nethermoſt hell
to the higheſt heauens.
            Secondly,2. as I muſt call in faith
if I will be heard, ſo muſt I pray in
humilitie, if I will haue anſwere: for
he hath regarded the lowe degree of his
handmaid, it was her virginall voyce,

and in the humblenes of her heart
ſhe was exalted with her God. O its
an excellent vertue, when honor is
humbled, and humilitie is honored
with the title of bleſſednes, as it was
with Mary.
            
            
               Iudeths humilitie pulled downe
the Aſſirian pride, when powring
out her prayer to God for the deliuerance
of her people,Iud. 9. 11. ſhe ſaid. Thy power
ſtandeth not in the multitude, nor thy
might in ſtrong men, but thou O
Lord art the helpe of the humble
and little ones. Aron and Hur muſt
hold vp Moſes hands, leſt he might
ſeeme to be exalted in his owne
ſtrēgth. And when Heſter the Queen
was to deale with her God by prayer,
ſhe put off her princely robes, but
when ſhe went to the Kings Pallace
ſhe put them on: to teach vs, that we
may not deale with God as with
men, for hee will be better pleaſed
with our pouertie then with our
pride: with our ſackecloth and aſhes,
then with our ſilke and ſables. I, and
the child will goe alone, ſo ſaid Abraham
               
of his beloued Iſaacke, I and my
miſerie will goe alone, ſo ſaith the
humbled ſoule vnto his mercifull
Sauiour. No plea with God like the
pore mans plea, and to goe informa
pauperis, is the beſt plea in heauen,
though it be the worſt on earth.
            Thirdly,3. as the Lord muſt be called
vpon in faith and humilitie, ſo
muſt he be applied with good zeale
and affection: no perfume of prayer
but from a paſſionate heart, a broken
and contrite heart God will neuer
deſpiſe, his eye and his anſwere is towards
all ſuch, according to that of
the prophet,Iſay. 66. 2. 
               To him will I looke, euen
to him that is poore and of a lowly troubled
ſpirit, and trembleth at my words.
Moſes ſaid nothing, and yet he cryed
vnto the Lord, it was a paſſionate
prayer, not from Laodecean lippes,
but from a fyrie ſpirit, as with Anna
when ſhe powred out her ſoule before
the Lord in the day of her barrennes.
            
               Dauids affection in his prayer, was
much kindled with the oole of zeale,

when he cryed vnto the Lord, it was
more inflamed when he watered his
couch with his teares, for the ſinnes
of his ſoule, but moſt of all battered
when he rored within, for aflictions
without,Oſeah. 12. 
               Iacob wept & prayed & fou
                     •
                  d.
God at Bethel,
               Iſay. 39. 14. So did good Ezekias
when he turned him to the wall and
wept, ſaying, Attenuati ſunt occuli mei
ſuspicientes in coelum, mine eyes are wearie
with watching vpon my God, and I
had fainted in my miſerie, had he not
turned to me in mercy, & ſaid; I haue
heard thy prayers,
               2 King. 20 5. 
               and ſeene thy teares.
            
            What ſhould I ſay more, Mardoche
in the midſt of the citie, cryed to
God with a great crie and a bitter,
and he was heard in that he deſired:
ſo was Chriſt vpon the tree, when
greeued in ſoule, he waſhed away our
ſtaines in blood & teares. It was Auguſtines
ſorrow, when thinking vpon
his vaine paſſions, he ſaid, flebam Didonem
morientem ob amorem Aeneae, I
wept for Dido, dying for the loue of
Aeneas. but alas and woe is me therfore,
I ſeldome wept for my Sauiour

dying for my ſinne, nor yet for my
ſelfe liuing in my ſinne. Surely
teares and prayers are church weapons,
and I may conclude as Ambroſe
did with Monacha Auguſtines Mother,
when ſhe wept after his conuerſion,
vade a me ita viuas, fieri non poteſt vt filius
iſtarum lachrimarum pereat, Goe
from me thou mournfull mother,
and doe as thou doeſt, it can neuer
be that a ſon of all theſe teares ſhould
euer periſh So dare I ſay of the Saints
of God, ſorrowing & weeping, either
for their owne ſinnes or others, it can
not be that children of al theſe teares
ſhould euer periſh.
            I paſſe to the fourth,4. which is from
our feruencie in prayer, to our frequent
and often praying, thereby to
importune ye Lord, to be propitious,
euer wraſtling as Iacob did, and neuer
leauing him without a bleſſing. Nor
as it is in the Prophet,Iſay. 62. 7. 
               giuing him no
reſt till he repaire our ruines: for the
kingdome of heauen ſuffereth violence,
and the violent catch it, yea
and the Lord is ours by much intreatie,
as we are his by many allurements.

O that our prayer were with
more aſſiduitie, much and continual,
as euer needing, & therefore alwaies
begging. Eliah when he prayed for
raine, ſent his ſeruant ſeauen times to
ſee if ye Lord would anſwere his ſighs
with a ſhewer,1. King. 18. 43. 44 
               from the top of Carmell
he crowched vnto the earth, and put his
face betweene his knees, I ſay ſeuē times
he prayed with paſſion, and the Lord
was propitius, he fainted not, but continued
crying, til the clouds dropped
downe fatnes, he prayed with paſſion,
while the king was at his repaſt,
Ahab in his chamber eating, but Eliah
vpon Carmel praying. Iob muſt
faſt & pray, all the while his children
did feaſt and play, his prayers, his
teares, and his ſacrifice ſtill went out,
as the daies of their banqueting went
about:Iob. 1. 5. for ſo ſaith the text, thus did
Iob euery day: Darius ſealed ye decree,
and Daniel dread it not, but continued
his prayer, and was inſtant with God,
three times a day vpō his knees with
his face towards Ieruſalem,
               Dan. 6. 10. and his
windowe open that way: both to ſtir
vp himſelfe with the remembrance

of Gods promiſe to al ſuch as ſhould
pray towards that houſe. As alſo
that all might ſee, he dread no danger
of the Lions denne, but had rather
die ten thonſand deathes then
yeeld to their Idolatrie.
            And ſurely,Pſ. 55. 17 
               Dauid was much in
prayer, when hee ſaid, Euening and
morning, and at noone day will I pray, &
make a noiſe, and he will heaere me. So
Paul,
               1. Theſ. 5. 17 when hee ſaid, in prayer often,
it was his dayly exerciſe, and what
hee practiſed himſelfe, he preached
to others, when hee ſaid, pray continually.
            
            Fifthly, as our prayers muſt bee
often in reſpect of times: ſo muſt
they not bee limitted in regard of
places, whether in the great congregation,
and in publike, or abroad in
the field, leſſe publike, or in private
at home, when thou art ſhut in thy
cloſet, and art ſtill, there is a chriſtian
liberty, and freedome in all, ſo thy
deuction bee done without ſchiſme,
and ſeparation; for thou art not onely
tyed vnto the Temple, but thy
chamber, field, and garden, the moū
               taines,

dales and wilderneſſe, dennes,
caues, and hollowes of the earth are
ſacred for thy devotions.
            When Iacob prayed againſt Eſau
his brother, in that his dangerous
peregrination to Bethel, hee diuided
himſelfe from his family, that hee
might the nearer bee ioyned to God
in his praier, hee ſent his two wiues,
and his eleuen children ouer the 
                  •
               iuer
Iabbocke, with all hee had; and
when himſelfe was left alone, there
wraſtled with him a man to the dawning
of the day; he alone a Saint, and
in ſecret, wept and prayed, and found
God at Bethel.
            
            
               Moſes meditations were mentall,
ſecret, and ſilent, when alone he cried
to God, and yet ſaide nothing.
And Dauid a part made his prayer for
the adulterous child, when groueling
vpon the ground, hee grieued
and groned alone; Demiſſa turba aſcendit
Ieſus in montem ſolus orare. And
Peter at Ioppa prayed apart, when in
an higher roome he fel into a trance,
and prayed ſo long,Act. 10. 9 10. that hee languiſhed,
yet ſaw the viſion, and heard the

voice that filled his ſoule with ſolace;
Iud. 8. 5. I might tell of Iudith her Cell,
and ſecret, when ſhee made her turret
a temple to pray in. All is but this
as Bazil ſaith, Oratio ſecretū poſtulat,
Soules would be ſecret in their ſanctitie,
and from euery place, there is
a paſſage to his preſence. The temple,
the ſtreet, the chamber, the orchard,
field, and wilde deſart, the mountain,
dales, and wildernes, the dungion,
denne, and dunghill, are Sanctuaries
to Gods Saints, are ſacred for all our
prayers, prayſes, and paſſages, to God
in the day of our affliction.
            Thus haue I told you how to pray,
that yee may bee heard, how to call,
that yee may bee anſwered. It now
remaineth, wee beware of ſuch impediments,
lets, and hindrances, as
diuide betwixt God and vs, making
the Lord leſſe gracious in heaven, by
how much more graceles wee are on
earth. And ſo we come to the ſecond
part.
            Now that which letteth firſt,2. Part, & firſt impediment. is the
ſinne of not hearing the word. That

wickedneſſe is the firſt wall, or partition;
that beateth backe prayer, the
arrow of our deliuerance: I ſay, wickedneſſe,
as in them that pray, ſo in
them that are prayed for. It muſt
bee purged from both, before the
Lord will either heare or anſwere; Iuſtified
by that of Salomon:
               Pro. 1. 14. 
               Becauſe
I have called & yee refuſed, I haue ſtretched
forth my hand, and none would regard,
I will laugh at your deſtruction,
and mocke when your feare commeth.
VVhere, and if yee read on, yee ſhall
finde, how ſuch impietie ſtoppeth all
paſſage to God, his care frō hearing,
his hand from helping, his ſpeech &
preſence from all reliefe; Then ſhall
they call mee, ſaith wiſdom, but I wil not
anſwere, they ſhall ſeeke mee earely, but
they ſhall not finde me, becauſe they hated
knowledge, and did not chooſe the feare of
the Lord.
            
            A wofull warning to all ſuch, as
eyther neglect, deſpiſe, or trample
vnder foot the blood of the covenāt,
I meane all ſuch as are weary of the
word of God, and deſpiſe preaching,

they ſhall call, and not be heard; they
ſhal crie, and not bee anſwered; nay,
that which is wel worſe, and yet more
dolourous,Pro. 28. 9. 
               He that turneth away, his
eare frō hearing the Law, euen his praier
ſhall be abhominable. Some thinke
they pleaſe God if they pray & heare
not, they muſt bee warned, they peſter
not the Lords preſence with ſo
ſtinking a breath, in ſtead of more
ſweet perfume, and while they would
make themſelues acceptable to God
for their much praying, they become
not abhominable for their ſeldome
hearing; they thinke to bee
heard, ſaith our Sauiour, for their
much babling; as and if hee ſhould
ſay, correcting that error; nay rather,
they ſhall bee anſwered for their diligent
hearing.
            Secondly, as the eare muſt bee
prepared for hearing,A ſecond impedimēt that our prayers
may haue paſſage; ſo muſt wee
lift vp pure hands to God, that wee
may haue audience; for a good life
muſt lead a good praier, according to
that, Oratio niſi bona vita praecedat non

exauditur: or at leaſt, 
                  •
               hey muſt goe
together without diſtraction; for as
one hath well ſaid, qui rectè nouit orare
rectê nouit viuere, Hee that can tell
how to pray well, knoweth how to
liue well.
            
               God by the Prophet taxeth Iſrael
of great impietie, in that their
declining eſtate, and therefore would
endure no entreaty,
               Iſaih 1. 15 &c. 
               but vpon their
conformity. When you ſhall ſtretch out
your hands, I will hide mine eyes from
you, and though you make many prayers,
I will not heare, for your hands are full
of blood: but waſh you, make you cleane,
take away the euill of your workes from
before your eyes, ceaſe to doe evill, learne
to doe well ſeeke iudgement, relieue the
oppreſſed, iudge the fatherleſſe, and defend
the widdow: Then come, and let
vs reaſon together, ſaith the Lord, though
your ſinnes were as crimſon, they ſhall bee
white as ſnow, though they were red like
skarlet, they ſhall be as wooll.
            The ſame Prophet from the ſame
God, and to the ſame people, yet further
preſſeth Iſraels impietie againſt

the Lord, whereby hee ſeemeth leſſe
placable, whileſt they charge him
of impotency, that he cannot helpe,
and of dulneſſe that he cannot heare:
but he yeelds them a more ſolide reaſon
of his reſtraint, euen their wickedneſſe,
the wall of ſeparation that
keepes them aſunder: For, Behold
ſaith the Prophet,Iſaiah. 59. 1. 2. 
               The Lords hand is
not ſhortned that hee cannot ſaue, neither
is his eare heauy that it cannot heare: but
your iniquities haue ſeparated betweene
you and your God, and your ſinnes haue
hid his face from you, that hee will not
heare.
            
            Sinnes? and what ſinnes? reade
the wordes that follow, ſinnes of
Iſrael then, ſinnes of England now:
what marvell then, if wee pray and
ſpeed no better then Iſrael then did;
for if wee blend in ſinne with Iſrael,
why ſhould wee not blend in judgements
with them?
            And theſe are the ſinnes of Iſrael
and Iudah, wherewithall they are
charged, ô that our Engliſh Iudah were
well diſcharged of them. Your hands

ſaith God by the Prophet, are defiled
with blood: crueltie is in your
waies, your fingers are full of iniquitie,
they receiue bribes, and are nimble
to ſpoyle.
            Your lippes ſpeake lies, who can
be beleeued? mel in ore verba lactis, fel
in corde fraus in factis, there is hony in
the mouth, but gaule in the heart,
good words, but euill deeds.
            7 No man calleth for iuſtice, truth
periſheth in the ſtreete, equitie cannot
enter, and hee that refraineth
from euill, maketh himſelfe a prey.
The Lord ſaw this, and was diſpleaſed
with Iſrael, and yet their greateſt vanitie
was in this, that they thought
their day of ſinning would euer
downe, they dread no iudgement till
it was at their doores, and fell vpon
them. Thus infected my deare brethren
with ſinne, how ſhould wee
thinke not to be afflicted for our ſin?
how may we expect from the Lord
either audience or anſwere, when we
pray? Templum domini will ſerue no
turne in this our temporiſing age, if

our ſins make a ſeparation betweene
God and vs.
            When the cloud of Iſraels ſinne
had ſhadowed the face of the Lord
ſhining, Ieremiah laid downe his lamentation
thus.Lam. 3. 4. 
               Thou haſt couered thy
face with a cloud, that our prayers ſhould
nor paſſe through. And it was the greateſt
griefe that euer came to Sauls
hart,1. Sam. 28. 15. when he ſaid, ſighing, The Lord
is departed from me, and anſwereth me
no more. Where if you marke the ſtorie,
ye ſhall find how Sathan found
him, when the Lord had left him, and
when the holy Oracle was ſilent, the
hollow vault at Endor ſpake: to teach
vs, that if we will not know there is a
God, we ſhall be taught that there is
a diuell. Zim and Ohim wil haunt our
habitations, and the witch at Endor
will endaunger our dwellings.
            A third wall of ſeparation ſtopping
the paſſage of our prayer to
God,3. Impediment. is the ſinne of vnmercifulnes
towards the poore: for as the wiſeman
ſaith,Prou. 21. 13. 
               He that ſtoppeth his eare at
the crying of the poore, he alſo ſhall cry

and not be heard, vnmercifulnes towards
the poore, was one of the ſins
of Sodome, and little doe I doubt but
it ſtopt the paſſage of Abrahams prayer,
euen frō fiftie to tenne mercifull
men not found in Sodome for whoſe
ſake the Lord might ſpare the reſt.
            The vſe is good, I pray God the
teares of the poore hinder not the
prayers of the rich: many are oppreſſed,
& yet are not pittied: we can goe
to no pulpit, but they preſſe our harts
to prouoke our ſpeech, & all I can ſay
is this, take heed, for as ye know, he
yt would not giue a crum of comfort,
was denied a drop of mercy, and not
to pittie the poore on earth, it cannot
but hinder your prayer in heauē.
            Fourthly,4. Impediment. if you long after audience,
and anſwere frō God, of that ye
pray for, you muſt beware of malice,
and picke out that poyſon: you muſt
forgiue, that you may be forgiuen:
yea and which is yet more, you
muſt pray for your worſt enemie,
that you may preuaile with your beſt
friend. That friend hath well aduiſed

thee as a friend,Mark. 11 25. ſaying, When ye ſhall
ſtand and pray, forgiue, if ye haue any
thing againſt any man, that your father
alſo which is in heauen, may forgiue you
your trespaſſes.
            
            
               Ye aske ſaith a brother of the Lord,
and yet ye receiue not, becauſe ye aske amiſſe,
that ye might lay the ſame out on
your pleaſures: Its a fooliſh pleaſure
on earth, that beates backe a prayer
from heauen: Its a fooliſh paſſage
with man, that ſtops a paſſage with
God. And ſo for concluſion of this
poynt, be warned, that as you heighten
your prayers vpward, ſo you leſſen
your ſinnes downward. And with
Siracides returne vnto the Lord,Eccl. 17. 23. and
forſake thy ſinnes, make thy prayer
before his face, and diminiſh the offence.
            
               Laſtly,
               5. Impediment. 
               as wickednes in our ſelues,
and proper ſinnes doe hinder our
prayers: So when ſinne is in thoſe
we pray for, it often ſtoppeth our
paſſage vnto the Lord, and maketh
him inexorable. As in Ieremiah the
Prophet, when the Lord ſaid, I will

caſt you out of my ſight, as I haue caſt out
all your brethren, euen the whole ſeede of
Ephraim: Therefore thou ſhalt not pray
for this people,Ieremiah. 7. 16. neither lift vp cry or prayer
for them, neither intreate me, for I
will not heare thee: Seeſt thou not what
they doe in the cities of Iudah, and in the
ſtreetes of Ieruſalem?
            As and if he ſhould ſay, exemplarie
ſinnes, ſhall haue exemplarie iudgements,
for I will power my wrath vpon
this place, vpon man, and vpon
beaſt, and vpon the trees of the field,
and vpon the fruit of the ground: it
ſhall burne ô Ieremiah, and thy prayer
ſhall not quench it. Nay, and as it is
in an other Prophet,Ezech. 14. 14. 
               If theſe three
men, Noah, Daniel, and Iob, were among
them, they ſhould not but deliuer
their owne ſoules by their righteouſnes
ſaith the Lord God.
            
            All I haue ſaid is but this, if our prayers
be not heard, it is quia petimus 1.
indigné 2. indigna, 3 pro indignis: either
the thing is vnlawfull we pray for, or
we are vnworthie, who pray, or they
for whom we doe pray. The mother

of Zebedes childrē, had not her boone
at the hands of Chriſt, for that her demand
was not lawfull. Eſau had not
that he prayed for, becauſe he was
vnworthie. And if you poure out ten
thouſand praiers, either for the diuels
or damned, ye ſhall not be heard, for
their ſinnes are gone before them, to
their iuſt condemnation.
            And here ſpare me a while, and I
hope it ſhall not be vnprofitable to
the further ſanctifying both of your
will and skill in prayer, if I lay downe
certaine Rules whereby you may
know how diuerſly ye Lord doth anſwere
the requeſts of his Saints, & yet
all to their endleſſe comfort, if they
can but be patient of his anſweres.
            
                And firſt obſerue, and you ſhall find
it to be true, that God heareth ſome,
ad voluntatem & non ad vtilitatem, he
anſwereth their pleaſure, but not
their profit, what they would haue,
but not what they ſhould haue. As
when the people luſted after fleſh in
the wildernes, and loathed Manna,
God gaue them their fill, yet while

the fleſh was betweene their teeth,Numb. 11 10. 30. &
before it was chewed, the wrath of the
Lord was kindled againſt the people,
& the Lord ſmote the people with an
exceeding great plague, in ſo much
as the place of their buriall is called
vnto this day,1. Sam. 8. 6. 7. 
               kibroth hattauah, graues
of luſt. Againe, it was their deſire to
haue a king like other nations,Deut. 17. 14. whervnto
ye Lord yeelded, yet told them
it had beene better for them if they
had not forſaken him, but kept him
ſtill their guidon. The vſe is good againſt
all ſuch as pray for nothing
but for the pleaſures, and profites of
this world, beautie, wealth, and plodding
wit, which oftentimes God putteth
into their hands, like a ſword into
the hands of a lunatike man, wherwithall
he endangereth himſelfe, and
ſo, the Lord anſwereth all ſuch, ad
voluntatem & non ad vtilitatem.
            
            The ſecond rule is religious too,
& much to the ſolace of Gods Saints,
who often heareth, and anſwereth, ad
vtilitatem non advolūtatem, anſwereth
I ſay our profit, and not our pleaſure.
As he did Paul, who praying thrice,

that Sathans buffettings, which were
the prickes of the fleſh, might be taken
from him: Chriſt anſwered, no
Paul not ſo:2. Cor. 12. 7. 
               my grace is ſufficient for
thee, and my power is made perfect
through thy weakenes. And this made
the Saints of God to reioyce in nothing
more then in the croſſe of
Chriſt, where by the world was crucified
vnto them, and they vnto the
world, they reioyced in their infirmities,
anguiſh, and perſecutions,
though buffettings of Sathan, and
prickes of the fleſh, yet purging fire
fyning them for their God, whiles
they were reſolued that all the afflictions
in this world, were neuer worthy
of that glorie which ſhould be
reueiled, and all ſuch the Lord doth
anſwere, ad vtilitatem non ad voluntatem,
whiles they ſeeme to ſhrinke vnder
the burden of their afflictions.
            The third rule is not irregular
with God, who for the moſt part 
doth anſwere all his Elect children,
ad voluntatem & ad vtilitatem, making
them glorious by deliuerance in the

daies of their afflictions, anſwering
their pleaſure with their profit, and
what they ſhould, with what they
would, as he did the Niniuites, when
he deliuered them from their deſtructiō.
The woman of Siropheniſhia
from her diuell, the children from
the fiery furnance, Lazarus from the
graue, and Chriſt from his croſſe, yea
and all his Elect from death and
doome, when they ſhall meete him
in the cloudes, and be caught vp to
raigne with him for euermore, with
palmes in their hands, in ſigne of
victorie, and crownes vpon their
heads, in ſigne of glory.
            Laſtly, and not the leaſt to our 
comfort, read and you ſhall find, how
oftentimes and for the moſt part, the
Lord doth anſwere vs according to
that we ſhould aske, and not according
to that we doe aske: as he did Iacob,
who ſought a leader to Haram,
and God ſhewed him a ladder to heauen.
And Saul who ſought his fathers
aſſes, & found a kingdome: the Maries
ſought Chriſt dead, but they
found him riſen, And that Saint at

               Sychar ſought but puddle water at Iacobs
well, but ſhe found, & went away
with the water of life. Surely the rule
is true, vberior gracia quam precatio,
Gods grace is more abounding then
either we can deſire or deſerue, the
theefe vpon the croſſe craued but a
memento when Chriſt ſhould come
into his kingdome, and he had a promiſe
euen that day, of a perpetuitie
in paradiſe. To iuſtifie that I haue
ſaid, Vberior gracia quam precatio, and
therefore pray with good hope to be
heard, be your prayers neuer ſo many,
powerfull, or piercing, yet ſhall ye
find his grace wil be euermore aboū
               ding,
brimfull, and flowing ouer.
            I may not be long, and therefore 
paſſe to the laſt part of the text, which
is the reward, crowne, and diadem of
our prayer, boſſed with many bleſſings
from the Lord, more precious
then the Carbuncle, Topas, or Chriſolite.
And ſeldome haue you heard or
read of a powerfull prayer from an
holy heart, without remuneration
frō the Lord: for as you here ſee, inuocation
is crowned with ſaluation.

               It ſhall be, that whoſoeuer ſhall call vpon
the name of the Lord ſhall be ſaued: who
euer prayed and found not the Lord
propitious? who euer made intreatie
vnto his God, and had not a bleſſing
returned into his boſome?
            It is ſaid of Auguſtus Caeſar, that neuer
ſuter departed from him diſcontēted:
& that Titus Suetonius thought
the day loſt wherein he did not good
to ſome. A milder & more mercifull
Sauiour is here then all the Caeſars
clapt in one, euen our good God, called
Deus a dando, God in creating, but
good in giuing, for who hath gone
from him diſcontented? who hath
truſted in him and beene deceiued?
Come vnto me all ye that trauell, and be
heauie loaden, & I will eaſe you: it is his
gracious call, Be of good comfort my little
flocke, it is your fathers will to giue
you a kingdome, it is his glorious
crowne, Aske & ye ſhall haue, ſeeke &
ye ſhall finde, knocke and it ſhall be opened
vnto you, it is his irreuocable promiſe,
at which the gates of heauen fly open,
and againſt which the gates of
hell ſhall neuer preuaile: only wraſtle

with God for a bleſſing, till you haue
wearied both God and your ſelues.
The aduertiſement is good from the
prophet,Iſay. 62. 6. 
               Ye that are mindfull of the
Lord keepe not ſilence, and giue him no
reſt till he haue repaired your ruines, and
ſet vp Ieruſalem the ioy of the world.
            
            But what may be the different bleſſings
we receiue from God by our
prayer? and wherunto the Lord hath
tyed himſelfe by promiſe for the
performance, not for our merit, but
for his mercies ſake? Surely they are
many, and they are Remarkable, if
you pleaſe to rancke them thus.
            Firſt, by the ſufferage of prayer,
all the creatures of God are ſanctified
to our vſe: ſo ſaith the bleſſed Apoſtle,
1. Tim. 4. 4. 5. 
               Euery creature of God is good,
and nothing 
                     •
                  ought to be refuſed, if it be
receiued with thankeſgiuing, for it is
ſanctified by the word of God and prayer.
Stamped with the word of God vpon
the one ſide, and with the perfume
of prayer vpon the other, then
is it a Shikel for the ſanctuarie.
            Our meate, our drinke, our corne,

our cattell, our clothes, and lodging,
our wiues, children, and families, our
labours in our vocations, our King
and kingdome, our Church and
Common-wealth, nay our liues and
deaths muſt be ſanctified with our
prayer, otherwiſe though the creatures
be good in themſelues, yet are
we profane in the vſage. And therefore
our Sauiour when he had performed
all to his death and paſſion,
yet ſhutteth it vp with this powerfull
prayer, Father now the hower is
come, glorifie thy Sonne.
            
            As and if he ſhould haue ſaid, I
haue prayed, I haue preached, I haue
wached, I haue faſted, I haue cured
malladies, and ſaued ſoules, I haue
giuen life, and forgiuen ſinnes, I haue
done my fathers buſines on earth,
now let me be glorified in heauen, I
pray for that which is paſt, that it
may be ſanctified, and I pray for that
which is to come, that it may be glorified,
Ioh. 17. 1. 
               Father now the hower is come glorifie
thy Sonne, &c.
            
            
               Ierom, in his booke, de laudibus

Bethlem, doth much commend the
Chriſtian carriage of that place and
people; in the vſage of Gods gifts
and creatures, euen from the Prince
in his Pallace, to the Plowman in the
field. Of whom he ſaith, Arator ad
Stiuam ſemper aliquid cantat dauidieum,
The Plowman with his ſtilt in
his hand, doth ſtill folace his ſoule
with ſome pſalme of Dauid.
            
            And ſurely God ſpeed the plowe
were no bad prayer, when the labourer
taketh the ſtilt in his hand, but I
feare it is done of fewe: And if all our
manuall trades were ſanctified firſt
and laſt euery day with prayer, and
prayſes for a bleſſing, they could
not but proſper much better.
            There is much pouertie in ye world,
and it is no maruell, for that men
worke not, yea but many worke and
yet are neuer the richer: thats poſſible
too, for that men pray not, they
ſpend their thrift in drinking, when
they ſhould beſtow their time in
praying: the creature is not ſanctified
with the word of God and prayer. In

the name of the father, and of the
ſonne, and of the holy Ghoſt, is neither
fond begninng, nor fooliſh ending
of all thy labours, bleſſed worke
ſo begun, bleſſed worke ſo done, ſo
it be ſaid of conſcience, and not of
courſe, without hypocriſie in the
heart, or ſuperſtition in the thought:
ſurely ſuch perfume is like the ſmell
of a field which the Lord hath bleſſed,
its ſweet as balme, and therefore
breake it: its fragrant as Myrrhe, and
therfore vſe it,Cant. 5. 5. 
               euer dropping from the
binges of thy heart, lippes, and hands.
            A ſecond blesſing that commeth 
by prayer, is the forgiuenes of ſins,
for by the ſufferage of prayer ſinnes
are pardoned, couered & concealed:
As may appeare by Moſes his intreatie
with God for the people,Exod. 3. 32. 
               either to
forgiue the trespaſſe Iſrael had committed,
or elſe to raſe him out of the booke
of life: he had his prayer, and the people
were both ſpared, and pardoned.
            Blood and prayer ſhall reconcile
God and the people: for as the text

ſaith,Leui. 4. 31. 
               the prieſt ſhall make an attonement
for him, and it ſhall be forgiuen him: Father
forgiue them, for they wot not what
they do. It was Chriſt his prayer vpon
the tree, and he preuayled. And Demitte
nobis debita noſtra, is our dayly
prayer, and who doubteth of indulgēce?
Sathan winnowed, Chriſt prayed,
and Peters faith failed not. Nay
that I may ſhut vp this aſſurance, and
cloſe with your religious eares and
hearts, who heare me this day. This
man ſaith Paul,Heb. 7. 24. 25. 
               becauſe he indureth euer,
hath an eternall prieſthood, wherefore
he is alſo able perfectly to ſaue them
that come vnto God by him, ſeeing he
euer liueth to make interceſſion for them.
Marke I pray you, how grace aboundeth
in our Chriſt, a man of our
mould and miſerie, ergo, mercifull
to ſaue. A God of might and maieſtie,
ergo, able to ſaue, yet not with
ſhadowes and Iterations like Aaron,
which argued his imperfection, but
once ſacrificed for all, which made
him an abſolute Sauiour. And all this
without limitation, either of time,

place, time, or perſon to all ſuch as
goe to God by him.
            Thirdly, as by the power of prayer,
the euill of ſinning is taken away,
and forgiuen, ſo likewiſe the euill of
puniſhment is often pardoned and
& quite forgotten. When Abimelech
had taken from Abraham his wife,
and ſo endangered his ſtate, life, and
kingdome, God by night warned
him of the wickednes by a dreame,
and ſaid,Gen. 20. 3. 7. 
               Behold thou art but dead, becauſe
of the womā which thou haſt taken,
for ſhe is a mans wife, now then deliuer
the man his wife againe, for he is a Prophet,
and he ſhall pray for thee that thou
maiſt liue: and if thou deliuer her not againe,
be ſure that thou ſhalt die the
death, thou and all that thou haſt. You
ſee the ſinne, you ſee the danger, and
withall, you ſee the meanes of deliuerance
from both. Euen Abrahams
prayer powerfull with God, to ſtay
the ſtroake of death from the king,
and barronnes from euery wombe
of the houſe of Abimalech.
            
            When Sodome for her ſinning, was

to feele the Iudgement of God puniſhing,
Lot prayed that he might ſhift
to Zoar, O let me eſcape thither, is it not
a little one, and my ſoule ſhall liue? to
whom God anſwered, Behold I haue
receiued thy requeſt: alſo concerning this
thing, that I will not ouerthrow this citie,
for which thou haſt ſpoken, haſt thee, ſaue
thee therefore, for I can doe nothing till
thou come thither. Where marke I pray
you, how prayer openeth the fountaine
of grace, and beateth backe the
ocean of Gods iudgements, it mouldeth
him to be mercifull euen to Sodome,
till Lot be ſafe in Zoar, for ſo
he ſaith, I can doe nothing till thou come
thither: thy prayer hath manacled
my hands, I cannot ſtrike till thou
be gone: haſt thee, ſaue thee, eſcape
thy life, feare and fire are a falling, ſee
thou ſaint not, either in thy powerfull
prayer, or ſpeedie paſſage.
            
               Corath, Datham, and Abiram, with a
rout of Rebels moe, ſtand vp againſt
Moſes & Aaron,
               Numb. 16. 41. &c. ſaying, Ye ha
                     •
                  e killed
the people of the Lord: God ſawe the
ſinne and haſtned on the iudgment,

when he ſaid vnto Moſes, get you vp
from among this congregation, for I will
conſume them quickely. Then as the
text ſaith, they fell vpon their faces.
And Moſes ſaid vnto Aaron, Take
the cenſor, put in fire of the Altar, caſt on
Incenſe, and goe quickely to the congregation,
and make an attonement for them,
for there is wrath gon out from the Lord,
the plague is begun.
            
            Then Aaron tooke as Moſes commanded
him, and ran into the midſt
of the congregation, and behold the
plague was begun, but when he ſtood
betweene the dead and them that were
aliue, the plague was ſtaid. O bleſſed Incenſe,
bleſſed praier, bleſſed ſtation,
O bleſſed deuotion, ſo readily running,
to repaire the ruines of a dying,
& decaying people, where fourteene
thouſand, and ſeuen hundred died,
beſides them that died in the conſpiracie
of Chora: yet as you may there
ſee by the ſufferage of prayer, the
reſt were ſaued, and the plague was
ſtayed.
            
               Elephas as it is in Iob, vrged much

the power of prayer, to deliuer from
puniſhment,Iob. 5. 1. when he ſaid to Iob,
               The Papiſts abuſe this place to make good their prayer to Saints, which is ſpoken not of the dead but of the liuing Saints. 
               call
now if any will anſwere thee, and to which
of the Saints wilt thou turne?
            
            As and if he ſhould ſay, to aggrauate
his griefe the more, O Iob of all thy
miſeries this is not the leaſt, that neither
thy God will anſwere thee, nor
the Saints will pray for thee, whither
wilt thou turne thee vpon thy toſſed
bed? if there be no paſſage for prayer
in the day of thine affliction, whither
wilt thou turne thee vpon thy toſſed
bed?
            Let Paul conclude for all, to make
good the power of prayer in this particular
of putting off the puniſhment
of ſinne, with deliuerance from danger,
when he preſſed the people to
pray for him. 1. That he might be deliuered
from the diſobedient in Iudea.
2.Rom. 15. 30. 31. &c. That his ſeruice in the church
might be accepted of the Saints. 3.
That hee might alwaies come to
them with ioy. 4. And that he together
with them might be refreſhed
with the ſhewer of all heauenly comforts.

A needfull prayer my deare
brethren, from you to God for vs,
who are your Paſtors, that we may
feed you without perill, that our ſeruice
may be accepted, that our preſence
may be with ioy. And that
drops of grace diſtilling from aboue,
may daily refreſh our more
then dying and decaying plants.
            And here I might ſeaſonably preſſe
with Pauls perill, Peters deliuerance
out of priſon by the prayers of the
Saints. Who when he was in durance,
and impriſoned by Herod the king,Act. 12. 5. 6. &c.
earneſt prayer was made of the
church vnto God for him, and preuailed,
for euen there (as you may
read) the praiers of the Church, ouerturned
the counſell of tyrants, obtained
the preſence of Angels, brake
the priſon, vnloſed the chaines, put
Sathan to flight, and preſerued the
Church, yea and Peter too, when by
the prayer of men, and conduct of an
Angell, he paſſed away without peril,
and was deliuered out of the hand of
Herod, and from all waiting for of

the people of the Iewes.
            
                Fourthly, and laſtly, as prayer is
the arrowe of our deliueranc
                  •
               , 
                  •
               oth
from the euill of ſinning, and the
euill of puniſhing, ſo is it piercing in
procuring all good things for vs,
from the hands of God.
            For by it, the barren wombe is
made batſome,Gen. 25. as in Sarah, Annah,
the Shunamit,
               1. Sam. 1. and in Elizabeth, of all
which it fel out,2. King. 4. as it did with Zacharie,
               Luk. 113. when the Angell ſaid, feare not
Zacharie, for thy prayer is heard, and
thy wife Elizabeth, ſhall beare thee a
ſonne, &c.
            
            By it the enemie is conquered, as
in Moſes againſt Amalecke, of whom
it is ſaid,Exod. 17. 
               plus fecit oratio moſis orando,
quam Ioſue pugnando,
               1. Sam. 7. 
               Moſes prayer
was more piercing then Ioſuas pike.2. Chron. 20. 6.
In Samuel againſt the Philiſtimes. In
Iehoſophat againſt Moab and Ammon.
In Iudeth againſt Holefernes. And in
Dauid againſt that Gyon of Gath, whē
he ſaid, what is this proud Philiſtim
that he ſhould reuile the Hoſt of the
liuing God, Thou commeſt to me with a

ſword,
               1. Sam. 17. 45. 
               and with a ſpeare, and with a
ſhield, but I come to thee in the name of
the Lord of Hoſtes, the God of the hoſt of
Iſrael, whom thou haſt railed vpon.
            
            It would be too long to tell of all,
but this is the ſumme, by the power
of prayer, diuels are diſpoſſeſſed, the
dead are raiſed, maladies are cured,
eyes are opened, tongues are vntied,
and ſinowes are loſed, prayer fatched
done fire from heauen, and it ſtaied
the ſunne in Gibion, it openeth heauen,
it ſhutteth hell, and ſhaketh all
the powers of darkenes, it conque,
reth God, it quieteth the conſcience,
it ſacketh ſinne, and to conclude,
as it is in my text, it ſaueth ſoules,
for it ſhall be, that whoſoeuer ſhall call
vpon the name of the Lord ſhall be
ſaued.
            
            Theſe words are three times mentioned
in the ſcriptures of God,Ioel. 2. 23. to
make vs the more attentiue,Rom. 10. 13. they are
riuited with a ſtiddy hand, & a treble
ſtroke, to make vs ye more apprehenſiue
of ye Lords mercies, they are driuen
in like holie nailes of the holy

Sanctuarie, wheron t
                  •
                hang our ſaluation
on the daies of triall, when there
ſhall be ſignes in the heauens aboue,
& tokens in the earth beneath: blood
and fire and the vapour of ſmoke:
then whoſoeuer ſhall call vpon the
name of the Lord ſhall be ſaued And
ſuch priuiledge haue all his Saints,
but the diuels & damned, ſhall either
be ſilent & dum in the day of danger,
or if they ſpeake, they ſhall call to
the mountaines to fall vpon them.
The Lord God of ſpirits prepare vs
euer to pray, and by that way and
meanes giue vs paſſage into the preſence
of our good God, there to haue
both audience, and anſwere, for his
ſonnes ſake, who hath ſaued vs from
our ſinnes, by ſhedding of his moſt
pretious blood, thereby to redeeme
the world of his Elect. To that God
and Chriſt, with the power of
the holy Ghoſt, proceeding
from both, be all honour
and glorie, this day and
euer. Amen. Amen.
            
            FINIS.
