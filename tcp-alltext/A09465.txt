               CHAP. I.
               The vnfolding of the text, by way of
preparation to the Treatise.
               
                  IN the former
part of this
chapter, Moses
hath faithfully
related
the drying of
the waters after the stood; and
Noahs sacrificing vnto God,
with Gods acceptance thereof.
Now in this verse and the



next, he recordeth such lawes
and decrees as God made
with Noah touching the restauration
of nature perished
by the flood; as well for the
sparing of the creatures from
such like destruction, as for
the continuance of his prouidence
in needefull times and
seasons, meete for their future
preseruation. These wordes
containe the first of these
lawes: wherein we may obserue
three points; Moses his
preface to this law; the law
it selfe; and the reason thereof.
               I. The preface; And the
Lord said in his heart: These
words must not be taken
properly, for God hath not
an heart as man hath, neither
speaketh he as man doth; but
hereby is meant, that God determined



and set downe with
himselfe this law and decree.
               In this phrase of speech,
note this one thing: If it had
pleased him, God could haue
spoken to man by a voice, the
hearing whereof would haue
confounded him: but as here
we see, he doth abase himselfe,
and as it were lay aside
his honour and might, and
speaketh vnto vs after the
manner of men, euen to the
capacitie of the most simple.
Which teacheth vs, that it is
the good will and pleasure of
God, that not onely the learned,
but euen the vnlettered
and most ignorant should
knowe and vnderstand the
holy Scripture: for els he
would neuer haue penned
them in a phrase & style that
doth so well accord to the



capacitie of the simple.
               II. Point. The decree it
selfe: I will henceforth curse the
ground no more for mans cause.
This is the peremptorie lawe
of God touching the restauration
of nature: wherein are
contained two things: first
what God hath done: secondly,
what God will not doe
hereafter. The thing that God
hath done is, the cursing of the
earth: for he saith, I will curse
no more: implying that he once
cursed it.
               In this obserue, that God
may truly be said to be a
cause of curses, and to curse
his creatures: not onely for
that he doth ordaine and decree
all curses, but also because
he inflicteth them vpon
the creatures: yet so as the
same is alwaies most iustly



deserued by sinne, before it
be inflicted of the Lord. And
so must Gods cursing of the
earth be vnderstood in this
place, as a fruit of his wrath
for the sinne of man: accordingly
God is said directly to
Isa. 45. 7. 
                  create euill, because whatsoeuer
afflictions, curses, and
punishments are in the world,
they are ordained and inflicted
by God vpon the creatures
for the sinne of man.
               This plainly confuteth the
common opinion of ignorant
people, who hold that all
good things, as peace, wealth,
ioy, and felicitie, come from
God: but all euill, as affliction,
calamitie, curses, & iudgements,
come from the deuill,
and God onely suffereth thē.
This is a most erroneous and
blind conceipt, which filleth



many a soule with much anguish
and impatience: for
what comfort can he haue in
the time of trouble, that is
perswaded it commeth wholly
from the deuill, and the
hand of God is not therein?
We therefore must learne to
reforme this opinion, and
know that crosses, and troubles
come from God. This
Dauid knew well, and therefore
when Shemi cursed him,
and railed on him, he forbad
Ab
                     •
                  shai to touch him, because
(saith he)2. Sam. 16. 10. 
                  what if (or, it
may be) God hath bid him curse
Dauid: so Ioseph telleth his
brethren, who most traiterously
sold him into Egypt,
thatGen. 45. 5. 
                  the Lord sent him before
them.
               
               Secondly, here consider
the impulsiue cause that moued



God to curse the earth
by a flood: it was not in the
earth, but in men: I wil henceforth
curse the earth no more
for man, that is, for mans
sinnes. In the newe Testament
there are two especiall sinnes
recorded for which God sent
this curse: first, carnall securitie.
They were choaked with
worldly cares, and drowned
in earthly pleasures: in the daies
of Noah, they did eat, and drinke,
marrie, and giue in marriage,
Matth. 24. 38. Secondly, the
contempt of the Gospell in the
ministerie of Noah, who
preached an hundred and
twentie yeares vnto them,
while the Arke was in building,
but they were disobedient,
as1. Pet. 3. 2
                        •
                     . 
                  S. Peter saith, following
their owne pleasures and
delights. Whereby it appeares



that these two sinnes,
Securitie, and contempt of the
Gospel, are most grieuous
sinnes: for these brought destruction
not onely vpon all
mankind (Noah and his familie
excepted) but euen vpon
all creatures that liued by
breath.
               Now looke as these sinnes
were in the old world, euen
so are they rife in this last
age; according to the prophecie
of our sauiour Christ,Luk 17. 26. 
                  as
it was in the daies of Noah, so
shall it bee in the daies of the son
of man: and as this is the state
of the whole world, so it is
the state of this our Church;
most men are drowned in
the pleasures of this world, &
choked with the cares thereof:
for howsoeuer they will
heare the Gospell preached



yet few apply their hearts to
beleeue the same, shewing
forth the power therof by repentāce
frō dead works, & amendment
of life in new obedience.
But we must know,
that if these two sins brought
a curse, euen destruction vpon
the old world, then no doubt
they will bring a fearfull
curse vpon this age, though
not by water, yet some other
way that shall countervaile
the flood, and therefore we
must lay these things to our
hearts, that vnles we abandon
securitie, and worldly lustes
and withall doe repent and
beleeue at the preaching of
the gospell, we shall see that
gods heauie curse will fall
vpon vs; for if we match the
old world in sinne, wee must
not looke to come behinde



them in iudgements.
               The second thing in this
decree is, what God will not
doe hereafter, Namely: curse
the earth any more: this must
be vnderstood of that particular
curse, which the Lord
laide on the earth by waters,
when he drowned the
world: for the generall curses
that were laid vpō the ground,
and on mankind for Adams
sinne, remaine still, and shall
not be taken quite away till
the end of the world: so that
the meaning of this lawe is,
that the Lord will no more
drowne the whole earth for
the sinne of man by a flood.
               Here then wee see the cause
why the sea being as raging
and stirring as euer it was,
doth notwithstanding keepe
it selfe within it boundes, and



not ouerflow the world: and
why the clowdes beeing as
full of water, as euer
they were doe not powre
downe more floods vpon the
earth to destroy it. Surely it
is by vertue of this particular
lawe, and decree of God,
whereunto the sea and clowds
become obedient, I will henceforth
curse the earth no more.
And here we haue iust occasion
to take knowledge and
veiw of our owne wretched
and damnable estate how we
are sold vnder sinne: for howsoeuer
we were created blessed,
and happie, yet by our
fall in Adam we are become
far worse then any earthly
creature; for each creature in
his kind, as the sunne, the
moone, and starres, the sea, &
cloudes, & all other obey the



commandement of God: but
man of all creatures hauing
lawes giuen him of God to
keepe, rebelleth in breaking
the same, and to him it is
meate and drinke by nature
to liue in the transgression of
gods commandements: Thus
by comparing our selues with
the brute creatures, we may
learne to humble our selues,
and to be abashed when we
see them which were made
to serue vs, to goe before vs
in obedience to the lawes of
our creator.
               III. Point. The reason of
gods decree, in these words;
for the Imagination of mans
heart is euil, euen from his youth.
At the first this reason may
seeme very strange, that God
should no more curse the
earth for man, because the Imagination



of his heart is
euill; In all likelihood God
should haue saide the contrarie,
I will still curse the earth because
the Imaginations of mans
heart are euill; for so he saith,
Chap. 6. vers 5. 6. that seeing all
the Imaginations of the thoughts
of mans heart were onely euill
continually, therefore hee would
destroy the man from the earth,
and from man to beast, & euery
creeping thing: Howe can both
these stand together? Ans.
Thus; In the sixt chapter the
Lord saith, he wil once destroy
the world by water, because
of the wickednes of the Imaginations
of man
                     •
                   heart: and
here he saith, he will not proceed
to curse the earth againe and againe
by the same punishment,
because the Imaginations
of mans heart are euill,



euen from his youth; as if hee
should say, I haue once drowned
the worlde for the wickednes
of mans inventions,
but if I should thus proceede
to deale with man according
to the wicked imagination
of his heart, I must bring euery
yeare a new flood vpō the
earth, because I see the frame
of mans heart is euill continually.
               Here then obserue, that
God in the preseruation of
mankind doth temper and
moderate his iustice by mercie:
for if he should deale according
to mans deserts hee
should euery day bring curses
vpon him; yea, so soone
as a man is borne hee should
be destroyed; but God dealeth
not so rigorously, hee
mingleth mercy with iustice,



whereby the whole frame of
heauen and earth, the state of
man and all societies doe
stand: That which Habacuke
prayed for,Hab. 32. 
                  In iustice, or
wrath remember mercie, the
Lord hath performed euer
since the flood, yea since the
fall of Adam.
               There bee three great and
weightie causes, which mooued
God to temper iustice
with mercie for the preseruation
of mankinde and other
creatures: first that hereby hee
might shew his patience & long
suffering towards the vessells of
wrath, (as the ApostleRom. 
                        •
                     . 
                        •
                     2. speaketh)
that is, towards such as
will not repent, that at the
last day they may bee most
iustly condemned: Secondly,
that there may bee a companie
of men vpon earth which
may worshipe God; for God



hath speciall care of his owne
glorie among men, and therefore
tempers iustice with
mercie in their preseruation,
that they might glorifie him:
Psal. 130. vers. 4. there is mercie,
or pardon with thee, that
thou maist bee feared; that is,
wheras (oh Lord) thou mightest
in iustice throwe all men
to hell suddenly, yet in mercie
thou pardonest the sinnes
of some, for this end that they
might worship thee: feare being
put for worship and obedience.
Thirdly, and principally,
that the elect, and chosen
of God might bee gathered;
for God in his eternall
counsell, and decree hath appointed
and set downe a certaine
number of men vnto
whom hee will giue eternall
life, and for their cause doth



hee spare the whole worlde
from daylie destruction: but
when that number shall bee
accomplished, then shall heauen,
and earth goe together,
and the worlde shall bee no
more.
               And here by the way, this
third cause of the continuance
of nature, must teach vs our
dutie; to wit, that seeing it
pleaseth God in mercie to
giue vs liberty to liue a space
of time in this worlde, some
twentie, some thirtie, 
                     •
                  ome
fourtie or fiftie yeares, and
that for this ende that heerein
wee might bee fitted for his
kingdome, when as in the
rigour of his iustice hee might
haue cast vs to hell in our
mothers wombe, or so soone
as we were borne, wee therefore
must bee carefull not to



despise this long-suffering &
patience of God, but rather
labour in the feare of God,
that it may become2. Pet. 3. 15. 
                  salvation
vnto vs, by our conscionable
endeauour in all such
meanes vnto the ende, as hee
hath sanctified for the working
of the graces of life in
the hearts of his children.
And thus much for the reason
in generall.
            
            
               CHAP. II.
               
                  Sect. 1. The illnesse of mans naturall
cogitations.
                  THat wee may the better
perceiue in this reason
the state of man in respect of
his naturall Imaginations, the
words are more particularly
to be vnfolded. For the Imaginations
of mans heart, &c. The



                     heart in Scripture is taken
sundrie waies: sometimes for
that fleshie part of man in the
middle of the bodie, which is
the fountaine of vitall blood:
sometime, for the soule of
man: sometime, for the faculties
of the soule: and sometime
for the middle of any
thing, asPsal. 46. 
                           •
                        
                      
                     the heart of the sea,
                     Mat. 12. 44 
                     the heart of the earth, that is,
the middle thereof. Heere it is
taken for the vnderstanding
facultie of the soule, whereby
man vseth reason: which S.
Paule callethEph. 4. 23. 
                     the spirit of the
minde.
                  
                  By Imaginations, hee meaneth
the frame, or framing of
the heart. And this is taken
two waies: of some, for the
naturall disposition of the vnderstanding
after the fall of
man: of others, for that which



the minde and vnderstanding
by thinking frameth, plotteth,
and deuiseth; that is, for
the effect thereof. Wee may
take it both waies, yet I rather
approoue the latter: for
Chap. 6. 5. the Lord saith, Hee
wil once destroy all flesh; and
giueth this reason, for the
frame and thought of mans
heart is euill continually. Where
by thoughtes or Imaginations
can nothing else bee meant,
but that which is deuised
and plotted in the thoughtes
of mans heart: so Salomon
speaking of an heart which
God hateth, saith, it is framing
or thinking thoughtes of wickednes.
Prov. 6. 18.
                  By mans heart, we must not
vnderstand the heart of some
particular persons, as of those
that liued in the old world alone,



but of all men generally:
man beeing put for whole
mankind.
                  
                     Is euill, that is, it imagineth,
and thinketh that which is against
the lawe of God: From
his childhood; that is, so soone
as he beginneth to thinke, to
reason or conceiue of any
thing, so soone doth hee imagine
& conceiue that which
is euill: so that the whole
meaning is this, The minde &
vnderstanding part of man is
naturally so corrupt, that so soone
as he can vse reason: he doth nothing
but imagine that which is
wicked, and against the lawe of
God. The words thus explaned
containe in them two
maine points touching the
frame of mans heart by nature.
The first is this;
                  The imagination and conceite



of euery man is naturally euill.
                  This appeareth not onely
in this place, but else where.
Rom. 8. 5. The wisdome of the
flesh is (not an enemie, but
emnitie against God. Againe,
such as the fountaine is, such
are the streames that flowe
thence; But our minde and
vnderstanding the fountaine
of our thoughts, is by nature
sinfull;Tit. 1. 15. 
                     To the impure their
mindes, and consciences are defiled;
And againe,2. Cor 3. 5. 
                     of our selues
we are not able to thinke a good
thought; and therefore the
thoughtes that come from
thence must needes also bee
corrupt: Mans imagination
stands in thoughts; the vnderstanding
deviseth by thinking:
And these thoughts of
the Imagination are all naturally
wicked:Math. 13. 19. 
                     from the heart:


                     
(saith Christ) proceede evill
thoughts: and Salomon saith, the
thoughts of the wicked (as all
men are by nature) are an abhom,
nation to the Lord.
                  
               
               
                  Sect. 2. Howe the naturall
thoughts of man may
be knowne.
                  Seeing that naturall Imagination
is practised by euill
thoughtes, wee must something
consider of the naturall
thoughts of man: And herein
handle these two poynts:
F
                        •
                     rst, whether the thoughtes
of man may bee knowne; secondly,
what the naturall
thoughts of man be.
                  For the first; there are
two waies to knowe mans
thoughts: either directly without
meanes, or indirectly by
meanes. The first way is proper



to God alone: for no
creature in heauen or earth
can immediately and directly
know the thoughts of man:
this Salomon confesseth in
his notable praier to God, 1.
king, 8. 39. Thou onely knowest
the thoughts of all the children
of men. Ierem. 17. 9. The heart
is deceitfull and wicked aboue all
things; who can know it? ver. 10.
I the Lord search the heart, and
trie thereines.
                  
                  The second way to knowe
mens thoughts is indirectly,
and by meanes: which be
three, by instinct from God;
by reuelation from the Scripture;
and by signes. First, by an
extraordinarie instinct: so did

                        
                           •
                        . king. 6. 9. 
                           •
                        2. 
                     Elisha disclose the king of Syrias
counsell to the king of Israell:
and by the same meanes,
he tolde his seruant2. king. 5. 26. 
                     Gehezi


                     
what he did behind his back,
when he tooke gifts of Naaman
the Assirian. And so did
Act. 
                           •
                        . 
                           •
                        . 
                     Peter tell Ananias and Saphyra
of their false conueyances
with the money that
they tooke for their possession.
And yet here we must vnderstand
that when God reuealed
these secret thoughts
to men, it was onely in some
things at some times, and for
some speciall causes: wherevpon
Nathan was faine to reuoke
his counsell, which hee
gaue to Dauid for the building
of the house of God,
1. Chron. 17. 2. 4. when he knew the will of
God more perfectly. And so
was Elias deceiued, when he
said he was left alone, of all Israel
that serued God: for1. king. 19. 1
                           •
                        . 
                     God
told him hee had reserued
seuen thousand, that neuer bowed



the knee to Baal, which Elias
knew not. Secondly, mens
thoughts may be known by
Revelation from Scripture: for
therin that spirit speaketh euidently
which knoweth the
frame of the heart: and hence
it is, that in the ministerie of
this word the thoughts of naturall
men, are made manifest. 1.
Corint. 
                        •
                     4. 25. Thirdly, mans
thoughts are knowne by
signes; as speeches, and actions:
thus Peter knew theAct. 8. 21,
heart of Simon Magus; and
Paul the heartAct. 13. 10. of Elimas.
And thus may any mā know
the thoughts of another, euē
as he may know the tree by
his fruit, and the fountain by
his streame.
                  Besides these three are two
other meanes added whereby
to know mens thoughts:



one by the Papists, and an
other by the Astrologians.
The Papists say, the Saints in
heauē know mens thoughts,
not directly of them-selues,
but by reflectiō in the glasse
of the Trintie. But this is a
meere forgery of their own,
which Isaia neuer knew, saying
thus of the Saints departed;
Isa 6. 3. 16. 
                     Abraham is ignorant of
vs, and Israel knoweth vs not,
but thou Lord art our redeemer.
And the Saints vnder the altar
crie,Rev. 6. 10. 
                     How long Lord, how
long wilt thou not iudge and auenge
our blood on them that
dwell on the earth? giuing vs
to vnderstand that they are
not so sharpe sighted, as by
the glasse of the Trinitie to
see into the day of the last
Iudgement, and therfore not
into the thoughts of mens



hearts. So that there are onely
three waies to know the
thoughts of men: and so they
may be knowne.
               
            
            
               CHAP. III.
               Of mans naturall thoughts
concerning God.
               HAuing found that the
thoughts of man may
be knowne; we come now
to see what be the naturall cogitations
of euerie sinfull
man. Although they be almost
infinite in themselues,
yet they may be reduced to
three heads. They either concern
God, or a mans neighbour,
or els, a mans owne selfe.
                  Of this thought; There is no
God.
               
               
                  
Touching God, there be in
man foure capitall euill
thoughts. First, That there is
no God: which as it is first in
order, so it is the most notorious,
and vile damnable
thought that can be in a naturall
man. And that this is
one of the thoughts of man
naturally, appeareth by the
expresse testimonie of God
himselfe, who knoweth the
thoughts of man better then
man doth.Psal. 10. 
                        •
                     . 
                  The wicked thinketh
alwaies there is no God.
And againe,Psa. 14. 1. 
                  The foole hath
said in his heart, there is no
God.
               
               Touching this thought,
obserue these foure points.
First, in whome it is: Secondly,
how a man by thinking
should denie God: Thirdly,
what is the fruit of this



thought, and fourthly the
examination of our hearts
touching this thought.
               For the first:1. In whome this thought is. we must not
thinke that this wicked
thought is onely in some notorious
and hainous sinners;
but it is in the corrupt minde
and Imagination of euery
man that commeth of Adā
naturally, not one excepted,
saue Christ alone: so the foole
of whome David
                  Psal. 14. 
                  speaketh
must be taken,Psal. 10. not for some
speciall sinner, but for euery
man that liueth vncalled &
without repentance, how ciuill
so euer his life be other
waies; though some shame
restraine his tongue from vttering
it, yet by nature his
corrupt heart is prone to
thinke there is no God This is
made euidēt by S. Paul,
                  Rom. 3. who



going about to prooue that
al men are sinners by nature,
aleadgeth for his proofe diuers
testimonies of Scripture
and particularly out of these
two Psalmes before cited:
whereby he giues vs to vnderstand,
that the foole there
mentioned, must be vnderstood
of euery naturall man.
But it will be said, that it is
ingrafted in mans nature to
hold and thinke there is a
God, & therefore euery man
doth not denie God in his
heart. Ans. We must know
that these two thoughts,
There is a God, and there is no
God, may be, and are both in
one and the same heart: the
same mā that by the light of
nature thinketh there is a
God, may by that corruption
& darkenes of mind that



came by Adams fall, thinke
there is no God: for two contraries
beeing not in the
highest degre, may be in one
and the same subiect: as light
and darkenesse in the same
house: heate, and cold in the
same body.
               
                  II. Point Howe doth a
man by thinking denie God
in his heart?How a man by thinking denies God. 
                  Ans. Two waies
first, by turning the true God
into an idol of mans braine:
secondly, by placing somewhat
that is not God in the
roome of the true God. For
the first, the Imagination of
euery man naturally, without
further light from the word
of God, doth turne the true
God into an idoll: and therefore
Paul saith of the Galatians,
that before, their vocation,
Gal. 4. 8. 
                  they did seruice to them which



were no gods; and of the Ephesians,
that
                  Eph. 2. 1
                        •
                     . 
                  they were without
God in the world: euen because
they did not in their
mindes conceiue of God aright,
and accordingly worship
him, though the wiser
sort amongst them did acknowledge
one God the
creator of heauen and earth.
And therefore David saith
plainely, thatPsal. 96. 5. 
                  all the gods of the
Gentiles are Idols, or vanities:
nay, as the Apostle saith, deuills.
1, Cor. 10. 20. That which
the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice
vnto deuills & not vnto God.
               
               Now mans mind turneth
the true God into an Idoll, by
three notorious thoughts,
which are the roote of many
damnable sinnes in this life,
first, by thinking that God is
not present in all places, whereby



god is robbed of his attribute
of Omni-presēce: for the
true God being infinite must
be in all places; which when
the heart of man denieth, it
imagineth God to be such a
one as he is not, & so turneth
him into an Idoll; and that
man naturally thinketh thus
of God the scripture is plain,
Iob. 22. 12. 13. wicked men
are brought in speaking of
God, as though he were shut
vp in heauen, & had nothing
to do in the world: Is not God
on high in the heauen? and behold
the height of the starres
how high they are. How should
God know? can he iudge, &c.
so the Psalmist expresseth the
thoughts of the wicked in
their practise of sinne, God
hideth away his face, & wil neuer
see: & the Lord shall not see.



Psal. 94. 7. yea they who seeke
the deepe to hide their counsell
from the Lorde, whose
workes are in darkenes, say,
who seeth vs? who knoweth vs?
Isay. 29. 15. Secondly, by thinking
there is no prouidence of
God, whereby hee ordereth and
disposeth all thinges in the
world particularly: That this
is an other naturall thought
the Psalmist sheweth plainly,
bringing in the wicked man,
saying thus of God, God
hath forgotten, he hideth his
face, and he shall not see. And
the prophet Zephanie bringeth
in the sinner speaking
thus of God, that he doth neither
good, nor euill. Thirdly, by
thinking there is no iustice in
God; this is done when men
Imagin with themselues, that
albeit they proceede in the



practise of sinne, yet God will
not punish them according
to the threatning of his word;
If we doubt whether such an
Imagination be in mans heart
read Deut. 29. 19, 20. where
Moses directly forbiddeth the
people to say in their hearts.
I shall haue peace though I walke
in the stubbornes of my heart;
this is that
                  Psal. 1
                        •
                     . 3. 
                  blessing of a mans
selfe in sinne, which Dauid
chargeth vpon the couetous, and
wicked. Thus they sinne thatAmos 6. 3. Amos. 9. 10.
                  put far away the evill day; and
say, the euill shall not come.
Hereby God is robbed of his
Iustice, and made a God all of
mercie such a one as will not
punish sinne, and so indeed is
made an Idoll of mans brain.
               The second way whereby a
man denyeth god in thought
is by placing in the roome of



the true God, an Idoll of his
owne braine: This men doe,
by thinking some other thing
beside the true God to bee
their chiefest good: thus voluptuous
men makePhil. 3. 19. 
                  their
bellie their God: and couetous
men makeColoss. 3. 5. 
                  riches their God by
placing their felicitie in pleasure,
and in riches: for looke
what a man thinketh to bee
the best thing in the worlde
for him, that is his GOD,
though it bee the devill himselfe,
or any other creature.
And for this cause is the devill
called the God of the world,
                  1. Cor. 4. 4.
because the men of this world
iudge their owne courses,
wherin they serue the deuill,
the best thing in the worlde
for them, yea farre better then
the seruice of god, & therfore
giue their hearts thereto: for



affection followeth opinion,
& that which a man affecteth
most, hee must needes thinke
best of; and therefore what
a man affecteth most, that
maketh hee to become his
God, so that iudging other
things beside the true God to
be best for him, he must needs
place thē in the roome of the
true God, & so in his imagination
donie God.
               
                  III. Point.
                  The fruit of this thought. What is the
fruite of this thought: for
thereby wee shall best iudge,
what a cursed thing this is, to
thinke there is no God: This
thought bringeth forth the
most notorious sins that can
be, euē 
                  Atheisme it selfe; which
is a sinne whereby men sundrie
waies deny God: And it
is two-fold, either in practise,
or in iudgement.
               
                  
                  Atheisme in practise is that
sinne wherby men deny God
in their deedes, liues, and conversations;
& so declare this
thought. This is a most horrible
sinne, and a huge burthen
to the whole earth; and yet
many that liue in the bosome
of the Church are fouly
tainted heerewith. This Atheisme
in practise hath three
speciall branches: Hypocrisie,
Epicurisme, and Witchcraft.
Hypocrisie is a sinne whereby
men worship the true God,
but yet in a false manner, giving
vnto God the outwarde
action, and hold backe from
him the true worship of the
heart. Epicurisme is a sinne
wherby men contemne God,
and giue themselues wholie
to their pleasures, spending
their time in eating, drinking,



and other delightes and not
seeking or fearing God: and
this is the sinne of the richer
sort in this age: Witchcraft or
Magicke is that sinne wherby
men renounce the true God
and betake themselues to the
aide, counsell, & helpe of the
deuill, either by himselfe, or
in his instruments: This is a
large sinne, and a great part
of Atheisme, and many are
taynted with this sinne, either
because they are practisioners
of witchcraft, or else doe
seeke helpe of such.
               Atheisme in iudgement is
that sinne, whereby in opinion
and perswasion of heart
men denie God. And this
likewise hath three degrees:
first, when men hold and accordingly
worshippe the true
God, creator of heauen and



earth, but yet so as they conceiue
of, and worship him otherwise
then hee hath reuealed
himselfe in his word. To
this first degree wee must referre
the three great religions
of the Turke, of the Iewe,
and of the Papists: for as they
stand at this day, they are
three great partes of Atheisme.
               The Turke worshippeth
God the maker of heauen, &
earth & likewise reuerenceth
Christ as man, acknowledging
him to be a prophet, yea,
a more worthie prophet then
his Mahomet; And yet his
religiō is Atheisme: for he cō
                  ceaueth
of god out of the trinitie,
and so worshippeth nothing
but an Idoll.
               Againe, the Religion of the
Iewes, at this day is a part of



Atheisme: for howsoeuer they
hold one God, and acknowledge
the bookes of the olde
Testament for the Scriptures
of God, yet they worship not
that God in Christ, and so instead
of the true God, frame
an Idoll in their owne brain;
for as Christ1. Ioh. 2. 23. saith, whosoeuer
denieth the sonne the same hath

                        〈…〉
                     
not the father, so that they
wanting Christ, and by consequent
the father also, indeed
and truly haue no God;
but as Christ tould the Samaritans
Iohn. 4. 22. 
                  they worship they knowe
not what.
               
               Thirdly the Religion of the
Papists at this day is a part of
Atheisme: we must indeed distinguish
it from the two former:
for in worde they acknowledge
the Trinitie in vnitie,
and vnitie in Trinitie, &



their doctrine of the vnion of
Christs two natures in one
person, is according to the
scripture: But yet if we marke
the drift, and sequele of their
doctrine in other points, wee
shall find it to bee close Atheisme:
As may bee prooved
by two reasons: first because
the true God who is the creator
of heauen and earth, is
infinite in Iustice, and mercie:
But according to the doctrine
of the Papists, God is not infinite
in Iustice, & mercie: And
therefore to them is not the
true God: for first, Gods
Iustice according to them is
not infinite: for they teach
that a man by his owne proper
workes of penance (which
bee finite & imperfect) may
truly satisfy god for the guils
of temporall punishment.1. Bellar. Lib. 7 de poenit. c. 7. Secondly,

or no mercie, as Paule
saith.Rom. 1. 6 If it bee of grace it is
no more of workes, or else were
grace no more grace, and if it bee
of workes it is no more grace, or
else were worke, no more worke.
Secondly▪ the Christ of the
Papists is a false Christ; this
will appeare by plaine reason
out of their doctrine: for first
they spoile Christ of his true
manhood by their doctrine of
reall presence, wherein they
hould that Christs body is not
onely in heauen, but really &
substantially in all places,
wher the sacrifice of the masse
is offered, thus they make it



omnipotent, & so quite take
away the nature of a bodie.
Secondly, they disgrade Christ
from the three offices of his
mediatorship: first from his
kingly office, byRhem. on ephes. 1. 22. sect. 5. placing the
Pope in his Roome, and stead,
as his deputie in Christs presence:
for they giue power to
the Pope to rule the Catholique
Church, and to make
lawes to bind mens consciences,
which bee thinges proper
to Christ alone: where in they
doe as much as if they should
take the Crowne from Christs
head, & set it on the Popes:
for to claime regencie in the
presence of the lawfull prince
is to proclaime rebellion against
the prince; for commission
of vicegerencie ceaseth
in the presence of him that
appointeth it; nowe Christ is



alwaies present with his
Church, Math. 28. 20. And
therefore the Pope by his
claime must needes thrust
Christ out of his office. Secondly,
from his priestly office,
which consisteth in satisfaction,
and intercession: Christs
satisfaction they nullifie byRhem on Rom. 8. 17. sect. 4.
ioyning therewith the satisfaction
of mens workes, for
thereby they make it imperfect:
And they robbe him of
his intercession byRhem. on 2. Co. 1. 11. sect. 3 communicating
the same to Saintes;
yea, they exalt the virgine
Marie far aboue Christ in this
worke, for they praie her to
aske the Father, to command
Christ her sonne by the authoritie
of a mother,
                  In officio be 
                        〈◊〉
                      Mari
                        •
                     . 
                  to doe thus, and thus,
for them, and so make Christ
her vnderling. Thirdly, from
his propheticall office, by making



the Pope the infallible
iudge of all controuersies: avowing,
that they rather desire
to knowe the auncient institution
of Christian religion from the
Popes mouth,
                  in annot. sup. dist. 40. c. s
                        •
                      papa. Edit. Greg. 
                  then from holy
writte. Nowe thus robbing
Christ of his offices, they
make him a false Christ: and
so wanting the sonne, they
cannot haue the father, for
he
                  3. Ioh. 2 23 
                  that hath not the son hath
not the father: and therefore
popish religion wanting the
father and the sonne, cannot
bee a true religion, but meere
coloured Atheisme in iudgement.
               The second degree of Atheisme
in iudgement is when
men place some Idoll in rome
of the true God, houlding
the same for their God: thus
did the Gentiles sinne in worshipping



the sonne, and the
moone, and the starres or other
creatures.
               The third degree is, when
a man doth avouch, hould, &
maintaine that there is no
God at all; this is the highest
degree of Atheisme and the
most notorious sinne that can
bee, and all such persons as
maintain this cursed thought,
are vnworthie the common
breath of men: for if that
man shall die the death, and
that worthilie, who shall avouch
his lawfull prince to be
no prince, howe much more
ought hee to die the death,
though hee had a thousand
liues that shall affirme the true
God, to bee no God? Thus
wee see the fruites of this euill
thought whereby the haynousnes
of it doth plainly appeare.
               
                  
                  IV. Point. The examination
of our owne hearts touching
this thought whether it may
be found among vs or not:Examination of this thought.
doubtles every one will labour
to cleare himselfe hereof;
And the reason wherewith
many doe sooth vp themselues
is this, because they neuer
felt in themselues any
such conceits as this, that
there is no God. But wee may
easily deceiue our selues herein,
for a man cannot alwaies
discerne what bee the
thoughts of his owne heart:
There be in man two kinds of
cogitations, or as one may say
reasons: the first is a single cogitation,
whereby a man simply
thinketh, or knoweth, or
iudgeth this or that; and this
is properly called the mind:


                  
The other is a reflex cogitatiō
or reason, whereby a man
iudgeth that he knoweth or
thinketh this or that; and it is
commonly called Conscience.
Now since Adams fall, the
conscience is corrupt by originall
sinne, as be all other
powers of mans soule; whēce
it commeth to passe, that conscience
can not doe his dutie
in giuing true testimonie concerning
mans Imaginations:
but a man may thinke euill,
and yet his conscience not
tell him: and therefore wee
may nor say, because wee feele
not these euill thoughts in
vs; therefore we haue them
not, or we are free from them.3. Signes of this thought
               
               But that we may the better
examine our hearts, wee
must come to the signes
whereby this euill thought is



best discerned. Dauid in the
14. Psalme setteth downe
three signes hereof: first,v. 2. 3. 
                  A
disordered life: secondly,v. 4. 
                  not
calling on the name of God by
praier; thirdly,v. 6. 
                  contemning of
them that put their trust in God.
Looke where these are to
be found, there is this euill
thought, That there is no God.
Nowe if wee examine our
selues by these signes, we shall
finde this wicked thought to
be amonst vs: for first, many
indeede are content to heare
Gods word; but where is
that man that reformeth his
life according to that he heareth?
Certen it is, as their conscience
can witnesse, few turne
vnto God vnfainedly, fewe
doe breake of their course in
sinning. Now this vnreformed
life is an infallible token



of this damnable thought.
               Secondly, the exercise of
praier and inuocation on the
name of God, is rare among
men: no doubt many a touched
heart doth euery day
vnfainedly call on God for
grace. but yet generally this is
true: men goe on from day
to day, and from yeare to
yeare, and neuer pray vnto
God for supply of grace. Indeede
men plead for themselues,
that they vse to pray:
for they say the Lords prayer:
the Creede, and the tenne Commaundements:
but wee must
know; that with many this
practise is nothing, but a vaine
repetition of words; for prayer
is an action of the heart,
and not the labour of the
tongue, and lippes onely: so
to say the Lords prayer is not



to pray, for the words thereof
may be repeated with the
heart of an Atheist.
               And thirdly the contempt
of them that put their trust in
God, is rise among vs: for
who is so much scorned and
reproched, as he that maketh
profession of religion? Now
may that complaint be iustly
taken vp by the seruants of
God, Isai. 8. 18. Behold, I, and
the children whome the Lord
hath giuen me, are as signes and
wonders. And, He that refraines
from euill, makes himselfe a pray
to the euill tongue. Isa. 59. 15.
Yet let these scoffers know,
what euer they be, that seedes
of Atheisme doe possesse their
soules.
               To come yet more particularly
to the triall of this
thought in our selues: Whosoeuer



denieth the presence of God
denieth God. Now let the conscience
answer, whether we
be not afraid to sinne in the
presence of many mortall
men, and yet in the presence
of God doe make no bones
thereof, so the eies of men be
turned from vs. Now what
is this but either flatly to denie
the presence of God, or
at least to yeeld more feare
and reuerence to men, then
we doe vnto God? Againe
what is the cause why men
vse oppression, and iniustice,
deceit, and lying in their
wordly affaires? Is it not because
this thought of Atheisme
doth possesse their
hearts, that God regardeth
not these outward things?
Durst men directly sinne against
God in seeking these



outward blessings for naturall
life, if they did rightly relie
vpon Gods prouidence,
knowing euery good gift to
come from his bountifull
hand? Lastly, let the conscience
speake, doth not thy
heart while thou goest on in
sinne, say thus vnto thee, God
is mercifull, I will heareafter repent,
and so shall I escape punishment?
If a man doe well obserue
his owne heart, he shall
finde therin this vile thought,
which directly ouerturns the
infinite iustice of God, making
him a God all of mercie,
when as indeede he is as
well a God of Iustice as of
mercie. By all which it is
more then euident, that naturally
this vile thought
runnes in mans heart, There is
no God.
               
               
                  
                  Vse. Hereby then we must
learne to see what vile, miserable,
and wretched sinners
we are in our selues; though
we had no actuall outward
sinnes, yet this damnable
thought maketh vs accursed:
If a manEccles. 10. 12. 
                  curse the king in his
heart, the sinne is so great, and
heinous that the foules of heauen
shall disclose it: How horrible
then is this sinn for a man
in his thought to curse God,
the king of kings, and Lord
of Lords? This therefore must
humble vs in our selues before
the Lord.
               Againe, hereby we must be
admonished to vse all good
meanes whereby wee may
come to see, and know not
onely the grosse actuall sinnes
of our liues, but especially this
damnable thought of our



hearts; few there be that doe
see it, and therefore we must
be earnest with our selues in
searching our owne hearts, to
find out this and such like abhominations
that bee in vs.
And thus much for the first
euill thought.
               
                  Sect. 2. Of this thought; The word
of God is foolishnes.
                  The second damnable
thought of mans naturall
heart concerning God, is this;
The word of God is foolishnesse.
This thought must principally
be vnderstood of the Gospel,
as S. Paul declareth, saying,
1. Cor. 1. 2
                           •
                        . 
                     It hath pleased God by the
foolishnes of preaching, to saue



them that beleeue: where hee
calleth the Gospell of Christ
foolishnes, not that it was so indeede,
but because the vnconuerted
v 23. 
                     Corinthians, and
other Grecians, iudged the
preaching of Christ crucified,
the most foolish thing in all
the world. And in the next
chapter he saith,1. Co
                           •
                         2. 24. 
                     The naturall
man, that is, he that is not effectually
called, perceiueth not
the things of the spirit of God: to
wit, that a man must repent of
his sinnes, and beleeue in
Christ for the pardon of them,
if he would be saued; they are
foolishnes vnto him. Nicodemus
answer to Christ maketh
this plaine, Ioh. 3. 4. esteeming
regeneration (without which
Christ said no man could enter
into the kingdome of heauen)
to be a mans returne into



his mothers wombe, and a birth
from thence againe.
                  This wicked thought must
be vnderstood of the lawe of
God also; the heart of man by
nature iudgeth the threatnings
of the lawe to be vntruthes,
and so foolishnesse:
hence the Lord by Moses
forbad the people when they
heard the threatnings and
curses of the law denounced
against them,Deut. 29 19. 
                     To blesse themselues
in their hearts, saying, Wee
shall haue peace: herevpon he
denounceth a woe to them
that deride his iudgements
threatned, and say,Isa. 5. 19. 
                     Let him
make speede, let him hasten his
worke that wee may see it, &c. As
if they should say, wee doe
not beleeue that any such
things shall come to passe:
like to the mockers of whome



                     Peter prophecieth,2. Pet. 3. 3. 4. 
                     who walk
after their lusts, and say, Where i
                           •
                        
the promise of his comming?
                  
                  Now that this is a most
damnable thought may appeare
 by the cursed fruits therof;Fruits of this thought.
for first, hence ariseth that
deuilish and carnall opinion
of sundrie men,Machavelisme. that thinke,
and hold religion to be but humane
policie to keepe men in awe,
and so vse it as a politicke devise
to exercise mens braines
to keepe them from sedition,
trecherie, and rebellion: Secondly,
 hence springs all Apostacie,
Apostacie. and departing from
the faith; The Galathians
were a worthie Church planted
by the apostle Paul, yet
euen in his time they began
to fall away to another Gospell,
which made him to
maruel; and the reason was



this,Galat. 1. 6. 
                     they were not contented
with that simplicitie, which is in
Christ, but would ioyne with
him, the obseruation of legall
ceremonies. The like we may
say of those famous Easterne
Churches, as those seauen
Churches of Asia, planted by
the apostles; wherin the truth
flourished for a while, but not
long after the Apostles times
they fell into many damnable
heresies, as Arrianisme, &
such like. Yea about six hundred
yeares after Christ, they
embraced the damnable religion
of Mahomet. In the
West partes also, were worthie,
and famous Churches
planted by the Apostles, and
their successors, as in Italie,
France, Germanie, Spaine, &
England, who about the same
time of 6. hūdred yeares after



Christ fell to Papisme, which
spread it selfe ouer all Europe
and further (some few Churches
of Greece excepted) In
which religion men abandon
the Gospel, of Christ, and betake
themselues to another
Gospell by adioyning to the
truth of Christ, their owne
deuises: And this Papisme,
hath raigned euer since, till
now of late, & so hath Apostacie
taken place in those
Churches which the Apostles
planted; The cause whereof
was in the wicked and sinnefull
heart of man, iudging the
gospell foolishnes, whereupon
men were contented to yeilde
themselues to any other religion,
rather then to that simplicitie
of truth, which is in
Christ Iesus. We now in England
by Gods speciall mercie,



hold, and teach the word of
God: but if God should alter
our religion with the times,
the greatest part of men among
vs would forsake the
truth, and cleaue to any other
religion, and that only vpon
this ground, because they
iudge the Gospell foolishnes:
Let any man among vs
broach an error, or heresie, &
it shall haue patrones at the
first, be it neuer so vile and absurd,
& protectors afterward:
When that brutish heresie of
the familie of loue tooke shipping
in Germanie, and ariued
in England (though it bee an
opinion voyde of common
sense) yet it had applause amongst
vs, and was receiued
of many, and would haue
spredde it selfe further if the
preaching of the word, with



the care of the Magistrate,
had not suppressed it. And
the reason heereof is this;
mans minde by nature is full
of darknes; he cannot without
Gods speciall grace, perceiue
the things of God, and
so he iudgeth the gospell foolishnes,
and embraceth error,
rather then the truth, yea loueth
darknesse, rather then the
light, because his deedes are euill,
Ioh. 3. 19.
                  For the examination of our
hearts touching this badde
thought;Examination for this thought. After due triall wee
shall finde, that the mindes of
most among vs, are possessed
herewith: for we are indeede
content to come into the assemblies
where God is worshipped,
and we doe submit
our selues to the ministerie of
the worde to bee taught and
instructed: Therein wee haue



our owne personal sinnes displaid,
and reprooued, and
withall very fearefull and terrible
curses of the lawe denounced
against vs for the
same, both iudgmentes in
this life, iudgements in death,
and also iudgements eternall
after this life: Nowe let the
conscience answere, what is
the cause when wee heare
these things, that wee be not
mooued, why are not our
hearts touched with greefe
and sadnesse, when wee heare
Gods iudgments due vnto vs
for our sins daylie denounced
against vs? Some indeed there
bee whose hearts tremble at
the worde, but small is that
number: If a man runne thorough
the streets, and crie
fire, fire, our hearts are suddenly
stroken with great



feare: but the minister of god,
may stand and crie fire, fire,
the fyre of hell which isIsay. 30. 33.
                     kindled by the breath of the Lord
like a riuer of Brimstone as the
Prophet speaketh, and yet
mens hearts are nothing
mooued: what is the cause
that we should bee so affected
with the burning of an old
house by temporall fyre, and
be not affraid at the voyce of
God, which proclameth vnto
vs eternall burning, with the
fire of Gods wrath? Surely
the cause is this, our hearts
are forestalled with this false
imagination that the curses of
the lawe are foolishnes, and that
there bee no such torments as
the world denounceth; It will
not sinke into the heart of a
naturall man that his sinnes
are so heinous, and Gods



iudgements so terrible against
them, as the worde maketh
them: And till such time as
this damnable thought be taken
away, mens hearts will
neuer bee touched with the
threatnings of the law; this is
a barre to stoppe the way to
all such passions as the lavve
would worke.
                  Againe, when the minister
of God speaketh of the pardon
of sinne and of eternall
life by Christ, who hath his
heart melting for ioy in regard
of this saluation? Though
men be daily taught the doctrine
of saluation, yet who
learneth the same? Though
men bee called vpon to come
into the kingdome of heauen,
yet fewe striue to enter in:
though wee bee daily exhorted
to repent, yet fewe turne



to the Lord▪ all which bee
branches of the Gospell; but
men beleeue them not, because
their hearts bee filled
with this damnable thought,
The Gospell of Christ is foolishnes:
When the Israelites were
restored from captiuitie in
Babilon, it was asPsal. 126. 1. 
                     a dreame
vnto them: nowe if that temporall
deliuerance seemed a
dreame, what a dreame will
this spiritual deliuerance from
the captiuitie of hell & death,
to the libertie of the sonnes of
GOD in grace and glorie,
seeme to be? And indeede to
a naturall man it seemes foolishnes
that God should become
man, and that Christ by
death should free men from
death, and by suffering the
curse of the lawe, should take
away the same from vs, and



by his righteousnesse should
iustifie vs vnto life: all which
notwithstanding be points of
the Gospell. This also is the
cause why after long teaching
there is little turning, or
faithfull obedience yeelded
vnto the Gospel: neither will
it be better with men, while
this euill thought abideth in
them.
                  
                     Vse. 1. If this bee a truth,
that euery naturall man thinketh
the word of God to be foolishnes,
then wee must learne this
lesson of the Apostle,1. Cor. 3. 18 
                     Hee
that seemes to bee wise in this
world, must become a foole that
he may be wise, that is, he must
reiect his owne naturall reason,
and stoppe vp the eyes of
his naturall minde, like a
blinde man, and suffer himselfe
wholly to bee guided by



Gods spirite in the thinges of
God, that thereby he may bee
made wise vnto saluation.
                  Secondly, we must heereby
learne to make earnest praier
vnto GodPs. 119. 18. for the opening of
our eyes, that we may bee able
to vnderstand the Gospell
of Christ, and know the right
meaning of that word of saluation:
for of our selues wee
can neuer vnderstand it, vnlesse
the Lord instruct vs by
his spirit:Ioh. 6. 65. 
                     No man commeth
vnto me, (saith Christ, that is,
beleeueth, except it bee giuen
him of my father: Butvers. 45. 
                     euery one
that hath heard, and learned of
the father, commeth vnto mee.
Thus much of this second euill
thought.
               
               
                  Sect. 3. Of this thought; I will not obey
Gods word.
                  
                     
From the former ariseth an
other most vile thought, in
the heart of euery naturall
man, as a branch of the same;
namely because the word of
God is foolishnes, therefore I
will not performe obedience thereunto.
That this is the naturall
thought of man, Iob teacheth
plainely; for he bringeth
in the wicked (that is, euery
sinner) saying thus to God,
Iob. 21. 14. 
                     Depart from vs, wee will not the
knowledge of thy waies. This the
wicked man saith, not with
his mouth, for none is so farre
past all shame, that dares thus
blasphemously speake against
God; but thus hee saith in his
heart, his affections speake it,
when he purposed with himselfe,
to cast off the yoake of
God, and to liue after his
owne lusts: and therefore they



say further,v. 1
                           •
                        . 
                     Who is the Almightie
that wee should serue
him? as if one should say, It is
a disgrace to mee to abase my
selfe to serue God; I will not
doe it. The Prophet Ieremie
bringeth in the Lord saying
thus to his people,Ier. 6. 16. 
                     Stand in
the waies, and behold, and aske
for the Old way, which is the
good way, and walke therein, and
yee shall find rest for your soules:
but in the same place the
Iewes answer, We will not walke
in thy waies. Shall wee thinke
that they durst thus impudently
answer the Lord with
open mouthes? No surely; But
the Prophet in these wordes
setteth downe the purpose of
their hearts who hardned the
same obstinately against the
word, when they were exhorted
to repentance and obedience



before the Lord. Our
Sauiour Christ compareth
himselfe to a noble man that
goeth into a farre countrey;
now when he is gone, the citizens
of his countrey send
messengers after him to tell
him,Luk. 19. 14. 
                     that they will not haue
him to raigne ouer them. Which
though it be properly to be
vnderstood of the nation of
the Iewes, who did indeede
say so to our Sauiour Christ,
yet it may also be extended
to all impenitent sinners, who
say in their hearts; Christ shall
not raigne over vs: for so long
as a man is vncalled, he carrieth
a purpose to liue in sinne,
some in this sinne, and some
in that, and so doing, saith in
his heart, God shall not bee my
God, I will not submit my selfe
vnto his lawes, Christ shall not



raigne ouer me. This is plaine
and manifest by mens behauiour,
when they are reprooued
for their sinnes: Tell the
couetous man of his auarice,
the swearer of his blasphemy,
& the drūkard of his drunkennes,
&c. will he humble himselfe
in conscience of his sinn?
Nothing lesse: but his heart
will swell against thee, as his
furie and impatience will
soone be wray; and the reason
is, because he neuer thinketh
of his owne estate, how
by creatiō he oweth homage
vnto God, as to his creator:
for his purpose is to goe on
in sinne, and when he is reprooued
for the same, his desire
is crossed, which he can
not abide, and therefore rageth;
shewing thereby manifestly,
that in his heart hee



saith, he will not obey Gods commandements.
                  
                  For the examination of
our hearts touching this
thought:Examination for this thought. whether did we euer
thinke thus with our
selues; I will not obey Gods commandements?
Doubtles euery
man wil answer for himselfe,
that he abhors this thought.
And yet after iust triall it will
appeare, that generally this
thought is rife among vs: for
though we heare the word,
and receiue the Sacraments
the pledges of our saluation,
and will be counted the mē
                     bers
of Christ, yet whats the
cause that there is so little
knowledge of God, and obedience
to his word? And why
doe men in their callings
shew forth so small loue, so
little mercie, iustice, and good



conscience? The truth is, that
though some haue these
things in them in some measute,
yet the bodie of our
people is generally void of
these good vertues, and fruits
of the spirit: he that hath but
halfe an eye may see it: for
where is that religious keeping
of the Sabboth that
should be? where is that serious
performing of worship
vnto God which ought to
be? All which argue that the
heart is corrupt and deceiueable,
and saith indeed to God,
I will not obey thy word; Lord depart
from me. What man almost
is there that saith with
himselfe, Oh miserable man,
what haue I done?
                  
                  
                     The Vse. By this wicked
imagination we may see
how hard a thing it is truly



and soundly to conuert a sinner
vnto God, and how easily
a man may deceiue his
owne soule, and beguile the
world by hypocrisie: for a
man by long exercise in the
word may haue a great measure
of knowledge, and withall
good wit, and memorie,
and with them vtterance; and
by a common gift of the spirit,
be able
                        •
                     e we must
                        •
                      word
truly, and to conceiue prayer
to good purpose; and withall
haue a cankred heart towards
God, poisoned with
this damnable thought, I will
not obey the word of God: for euery
man that hath inwardly
in him a purpose to liue,
though but in one sinne, his
heart is not vpright with
God, neither be Gods graces,
as faith, and repentance,



sound in his heart: for true
repentance is a purpose, and
resolution to leaue all sinne,
and to please God in all
things.
               
               
                  Sect. 4. Of this thought; It is a vaine
thing to worship
God.
                  The third wicked imagination
of ma
                        ••
                      heart concerning

                        〈…〉
                     
                     thing to worship God. This Iob
sheweth to be true: bringing
in the wicked man saying,Iob. 21. 15.
                     what profit shall I haue if I pray
vnto God: we must not thinke
that hee said thus with his
mouth, but in his heart: And
the prophet Malachie bringeth
in the Iewes saying,Mal. 
                           •
                        . 3. 14. 
                     It
is a vaine thing to serue God, and
what profit is it that wee haue
kept his commandement, & that



we walked humbly before the
Lord of hostes: Yea righteous
Dauid, a man after Gods
owne heart, was ouertaken
with this euill thought, when
he said,Psa. 73. 13. 
                     certenly I haue cleansed
my heart in vaine, and washed
my hands in Innocencie:
whereby it is plaine, that this
is a naturall evill thought in
every man.
                  Yet here we must remember,
that this evill thought
comes not into the mind of
man at all times, but onely at
such time, when occasiō is offered,
as namely when a man
is called on, to the seruice of
God, which vpon some occasion
he is desirous to omitte;
Then will his mind range about
for libertie from Gods
seruice, and so will he bethink
himselfe of the wicked mans



estate who neuer serued god,
and yet is in better case outwardly
then the godly man
is; And herevpon hee begins
to say in his heart doutbles, It
is a vaine thing to serue God.
                  
                  For the examination of
our hearts touching this
thought;Examination for this thought. after iust triall it will
be found among vs, as the
state of all sorts of families
will declare: Among the poorer
sort you shall see men labour
from morning to Evening,
and take great paines to
prouide for the world, but in
the meane time where is the
worship and seruice of God▪
where is prayer and thanksgiuing,
morning, and euenning?
Surely it is neglected,
& the reason is because they
thinke thus in their heart, so
that I may haue prouision for the



world, it is no matter whether I
serue God or not. Come to the
rich mans house, & there you
shal see them spend their time
in eating, drinking, gaming,
and such delightes; but the
worship of God is not regarded,
for thus they thinke with
themselues, If they may haue
their pleasure all is well. Come
& reason with ordinary men,
and exhort them to vse the
meanes of saluation, and shew
forth loue vnto religion sincerely:
Their answer is, they
will doe as they haue done,
and as their forefathers did
before them; they trust their
soules are as good to Godward
as the best: And for
ought they see, none are
worser then those that haue
so much preaching, and therfore
they hope to bee saued



though they doe not follow
it so much: And this also
cōmeth frō this euill thought.
It is in vaine to serue God.
Marke also in those places
wher the Gospel is preached;
If any seeme to make more
conscience of sinne, and of
seruing God then others, they
are made a by-word and a
mocking stock, and their profession
is turned to their reproach:
which argues plainely
that mans thought is this, It
is a vaine thing to serue God.
Nay, take a vew of the whole
world, and you shall see euery
wher, men giue themselues to
will-worship: No nation is so
barbarous as to denie vnto
God all worship; but doe they
giue vnto him that which he
commanded in his word?
Nothing lesse: It is either the



meere invention of men, or
altogether stayned therewith:
This is most euident with the
Turke, the Iew, and the Papist:
yea our common sort of
protestants haue their will-worship:
for generally they
content themselues with the
mumbling ouer the words of
the Creede, the Lords Prayer,
and tenne Commandements,
perswading themselues that
by the bare rehearsall of the
words, they haue sufficiently
serued God. Now would wee
know the cause hereof; as
also why men are so slack and
cold in praier, so carelesse, and
vnreuerent in hearing Gods
word? Surely it is nothing
but this vile Imagination bewitching
our soules, that it
Is a vaine thing to serue God;
This quencheth the spirit, and



hindreth all good motiōs that
be in our hearts.
               
               
                  Sect. 5. Of mans thought of
distrust.
                  The fourth euill thought
concerning God, is, a thought
of distrust, thus framed in the
minde;: God doth not regard me;
God will not helpe me; God will
not be mercifull vnto me: This
thought made entrance vnto
the fall of our first parents:
for first Eue looked vpon the
fruit, & saw that it was beutifull,
and then entred into her
heart a thought of distrust
after this manner; It may be
it is not true which god hath
said to vs concerning this
fruit, and it may be God regardeth
vs not as we thinke



he doth, in that he denieth vs
this fruit; heere vpon her will
and her affections were carried
to the breaking of Gods
commandement, and so shee
sinned by disobedience, and
Adam also sinned. When the
people of Israel murmured in
the wildernes a 
                     Moses sinned
a sin for hee was debarred entrance
into the land of Canaā:Num. 20. 12.
Nowe what was Moses sinne
for both he & Aron
                     v. 6. 
                     prayed to
the Lord, and checked the people
saying heare oh yee rebells, &c.
And at Gods commandement he
brought water out of the rocke?
Surely his sin was secret euen
inward vnbeleefe and distrust
in Gods promise, for when
hee smote the rocke, he might
thinke thus with himselfe; it
may bee that God will not
nowe giue water out of the



rocke; & this seemes the more
probable because hee went
beyond his cōmission in smiting
thrise vpon the rock, whē
God bad him onely to speake
                     v. 
                           •
                        . 
                     vnto it. This euill thought
takes hould of religious David
also:Psal. 31. 21. 
                     I sayd in mine hast I
am cast out of thy sight, as
though he should say, Heretofore
I haue found Fauour
with God, but nowe in mine
aduersitie I am vtterly reiected:
Againe,Psal. 116. 21. 
                     I said in my feare,
all men are lyers; that is, when
feare of death tooke hould of
mee, then I thought that Samuell
lied vnto mee, when he
saide I should come to the
kingdome ouer Israell. The
children of Israell did often
bewray this thought of distrust;
when they were pinched
with hunger, and famine



in the wildernes, they say,
Psal. 78. 19. 20. 
                     can God prouid a table for vs in
the wildernes? can he giue bread
and flesh for his people? As if
they should say, we thinke he
cannot, nor will not: Yea the
Apostle Peter was not free
from this thought, for when
Christ walking on the waters,
commanded Peter to come
vnto him, hee came out boldly,
and walked towards Iesus,
but whenMat. 14. 30. 
                     hee sawe a mightie
wind he began to sinke: whence
came this? surely from a
thought of distrust which hee
had in his heart to this effect:
It may be god wil not support me
in this my walking: & that this
or some such thought was
in his heart appeareth by
Christs answer to him saying,
h 
                     oh thou of little faith, why
diddest thou doubt? By all which



it is euident that this is a naturall
thought in the minde of
man which at some time
troubleth the most righteous
man that is.
                  Now touching this thought
of distrust, two things are to
bee skanned:Time of this thought. first, the time
when it taketh place in mans
minde; and secondly, the
daunger of it. For the time;
This thought doth not alwaies
take place in the minde
of man, but onely in the time
of some daunger, affliction,
and temptation; and especially
in the time of sicknesse,
and in the pangs of death.
Thus in his grieuous affliction
was righteous Iob troubled
with this thought of distrust:
for then hee complained,
that i 
                     God did hate him and
gnash vpon him with his teeth,



and as his enemie, sharpned his
eyes against him; yea, that
                     v. 12. 
                     hee
made him as his butt, and marke
to shoote at. And Dauide in a
greiuous trouble of minde,
thus complained:Psal. 77. 7. 
                     Will the
Lord absent himselfe for euer?
And will hee shewe no more fauour?
Is his mercie cleane gone
for euer? Doth his promise faile
for euermore? hath God forgotten
to be mercifull? &c. Whereby
appeareth, that in his affliction
hee was greatly troubled
with this distrustfull
thought; and there is no man
liuing, but when trouble and
affliction comes, hee shal feele
in himselfe these thoughts of
distrust. Indeede while peace,
and ease continue, presumptuous
thoughts possesse the
minde; but when the daies
of peace bee gone, & troublesome



times approach, then
presumptuous thoughts giue
place, and thoughtes of distrust,
come in their roome &
stead.
                  
                     II. Point.
                     Fruite of this thought. The daunger of
these thoughtes of distrust is
verie great, as the fruits thereof
declare: for hence arise;
first, all horrours, and terrors
 of conscience, all feares, and
astonishmentes of the heart;
For when the minde saith
(though falselie) God doth not
regard me, God will not saue me,
then the trembling heart is
 full of horror and dread. Secondly
hence commeth desperation
it selfe; wherby men
cōfidently avouch that God
hath forsaken them, and cast
them of, and that there is no
hope of life, but present
death, remaining for them:



this thought troubleth the
minde of the wicked, and of
the repentant person also: for
desperation is nothing but
the strength of this thought
of distrust. Thirdly this weakneth 
the foundation of our
saluation, which standeth in
the certentie of Gods promises,
for this thought of distrust
denieth credite to Gods promises,
and maketh them vncertaine:
Among all other euill
thoughtes this doth most
directly hinder saluatiō; for it
is flat against faith, as water is
to fire: for true faith makes a
man say with good cōsciēce,
Gal. 2. 20. 
                     Christ died and shedd his blood
for mee; God the father will bee
mercifull vnto me, and saue me:
But this distrustfull thought
causeth a man to say the clean
contrarie. Christ died not for



me: God will not saue me: so that
where this thought prevaileth
true faith is not, neither
can take place.
                  
                     Vse. Considering the danger
of this distrustful thought
is so great, we must be admonished
in the feare of God to
vse all good meanes, while
the daies of peace doe last,
that it take no place with vs
in the daie of trouble, and
temptation:Meanes against distrust. The meanes to
represse it are the preaching
of the worde, and the sacraments
of Baptisme and the
Lords supper.
                  For the first: the word of
 God preached is a speciall
meanes ordained of God, for
the true applying of Gods
promises, of mercie to our
owne soules; and therefore a
most soueraigne remedie against



this thought of distrust;
for whē the promises of mercie
in Christ, are offered vnto
gods people in the preaching
of the worde by a lawfull minister,
it is as much as if Christ
himselfe in his owne person
should speake vnto them, by
vertue of Gods ordinance. If
God from heauen should say
to any man, mercie belongeth
to thee, hee would beleeue: if
God say to Cornelius, boleeue
thou, and my mercie
belongs to thee, Cornelius
will beleeue: if hee say to Peter,
beleeue thou, and my
mercie belongs to thee, Peter
will beleeue: and if hee say
so to Marie Magdalen shee
will beleeue. Loe heere, when
the minister of God, out of
Gods worde, saith to any
man, beleeue thou, and repent



thou, and Gods mercie belongs
vnto thee; it is as much
as if the Lord should call him
by name particularly, and
say vnto him, beleeue thou,
and repent, and my mercie
belongs vnto thee: yea, it is all
one as if God himselfe should
say, I am thy father, and thou
art my childe, if thou wilt repent,
and beleeue.
                  The second meanes which
 is also very effectuall to cut
off this thought of distrust, is
Baptisme. If an earthly prince
giue a pardon to any man, &
put the mans name in the
pardon, and his owne broade
seale vnto it, the man will neuer
doubt of his pardon, but
beleeue it. Beholde, in Baptisme
God entreth couenant
with miserable wretched
man, and heerein makes promise



of life vnto him; yea hee
puts the mans name in the
couenant, sealing the same
with his owne seale: & therefore
the party baptized, must
beleeue against this thought.
                  The thirde meanes, is the 
Lords supper rightly administred
and receiued: for therin
the breade and wine giuen
to the hand of euery communicant
by the minister, are
particular pledges and tokens
vnto them of speciall
mercie in Christ. These are
the meanes which wee must
vse with all good conscience
in the daies of peace, that
when troubles come, this
thought of distrust may not
preuaile against vs. And thus
much of mans naturall euill
thoughts against God. Many
other might bee added herevnto,



but these beeing the
principall, I omit the rest.
               
            
            
               CHAP. IV.
               Of mans naturall thoughts against
his neighbour.
               NOw wee come to the euill
thoughtes of mans
naturall heart against his
neighbour. And to find them
out wee must haue recourse
to the second Table of the
morall lawe, which was penned
with respect toGal. 3. 
                        •
                     9 the corrupt
estate of man, forbidding
that which mans corrupt
heart thinketh naturally
against his neighbour: for euery
commandement thereof
is spirituall, forbidding not
onely the wicked actions, euill
wordes, and gestures, but
all corrupt affections, yea all
euill Imaginations of man against



man.
               These thoughts of man against
his neighbour be of
two sorts; either without
consent, or with consent.
Thoughts without consent,
are the very first euill motions
of the minde which a
man conceiueth against his
neighbour, to which the will
neuer giueth consent, and
these are forbidden in the 10.
commandement, Thou shalt not
lust.
               
               Thoughts with consent of
will are such, as a man conceiuing
in his minde doth
withall desire, or purpose in
his heart to practise: and these
are forbidden in the fift, sixt,
seauenth, eight, and ninth
commandements; by reason
whereof they may fittely be
reduced to fiue heads. They



are either thoughts of dishonour,
against the fift commandement;
or thoughts of murther,
against the sixt; or thoughts of
aduletrie, against the seuenth;
or thoughts of theft, against the
eight; or thoughts of disgrace,
against the ninth commandement.
               
                  Sect. 1. Of thoughts of dishonour.
                  First, a thought of dishonour
is any thought that tendeth
to the contempt and abasing
of the person of our
neighbour, in respect of our
selues. And it is then conceiued
in our mindes, when we
thinke thus of all other men
beside our selues: such and
such a man, is farre inferiour
vnto me, a base and contemptible



fellow in regard of me. Example
hereof we haue in the
Pharisie, a man strict in profession,
and zealous in his religion,
who commeth to the
Temple to pray with the
Publican: now marke what
he saith,Luk. 18. 11. 
                     Oh God, I thanke
thee, that I am not as other men
are, or as this Publican. Which
wordes proceede from such
a proud thought as this; Lord
I thanke thee, all other men are
farre inferiour vnto me: I doe
farre surpasse the common sort:
this Publican is a base fellowe,
and no body to me. If any shall
imagine that this thought is
not in euery mnn, but in some
few proud persons; I answer,
it is by nature in euery person
liuing without grace: and
therefore S. Paul giueth this
commandement, That
                     Phil. 
                           •
                        . 3. 
                     euery



man in meekenesse should esteeme
others better then himselfe; giuing
vs to vnderstand, that by
nature all men thinke best of
themselues, and esteeme others
farre worse then themselues.
                  
                     The Vse. If this thought of
dishonour be in all mens
hearts, then behold what a
pallace of all Satanicall and
damnable pride the heart of
man is naturally:Iud. 1. 7. it is like vnto
the table of Adoni-bezek
at which he sate in a chaire of
estate, and made others, euen
kings, to eate meate like dogs
vnder his feete, with their
thumbs cutte off: such an one
is euery man by nature, hee
lifteth vp himselfe, saying, I
am the man, and treadeth his
brother vnder his feete, as no
body vnto him. And this is



the cause of much strife and
hurt in all humane societies:
this causeth many iarres,
much skorning, and great
contempt among men in
word and deede.
                  Now that we may reforme
this thought in vs, wee must
learne to say as Iob did after
he had beene afflicted, and
came to see his sinnes:Iob. 39. 37. 
                     behold,
I am vile: and with Abraham,
Gen. 18. 27. 
                     I am but dust and ashes: and
with Dauid, I am a worme, and
no man, Psalm. 22. 6. yea with
Paul,Rom. 7. 24. 
                     we must labour to see our
miserie by reason of sinne: and
that will helpe to pull downe
the pride of our hearts.
               
               
                  Sect. 2. Of murthering thoughts.
                  The second euill thought
of man against his neighbour



with consent, is a thought of
Murther, or of any thing that
tendeth thereto. Of this wee
haue particular examples in
Scripture. Deut. 15. 9. The
Lord forbiddeth the Iewes
to haue this murthering
thought in their hearts: I will
not releeue the poore, I will not
doe good vnto them; giuing vs
to vnderstand, that this was
the common thought of the
Iewes, or els he would not
haue forbidden it: yea the
Lord doth there set out this
thought by two signes; first,
an euill eye, when a man turnes
his countenance from the
poore, or looketh on them
without compassion: secondly,
vnmercifull dealing, when a
man will not helpe the poore
by gift, according to his abilitie.
And because all actions



proceede from thoughts, the
heart beeing the fountaine of
our deedes, hence it appeareth,
that this murthering
thought against the poore, is
rife in this age: for where is
the man that doth pitie the
poore, and doth good to them
according to his abilitie? nay,
the Lords complaint against
the Iewes may be fitly applied
to our times, in regard of
crueltie and oppression: The
spoile of the poore is in your houses:
what haue ye to doe, that ye
beate my people to peeces, and
grinde the faces of the poore. Isa.
3. 14. 15.
                  The second example of
a murthering thought, is cō
                     cerning
Gods Church, and it
is this. I will doe some spite or
hurt to them that worship God.
For proofe hereof, read Psal.



74. 8. Dauid bringeth in the
Babilonians, Edomites, &c.
saying thus one to another against
gods people the Iewes:
Let vs destroy them all together;
& Psal. 83. 4, Let vs cut them off
from beeing a people. And let the
name of Israell be no more in remembrance.
Now as this was
their thought, so is it the
thought of all men naturally:
for that which was the disposition
of Babel, Edom, Moab,
and Amnon against Gods
Church, is the disposition of
all men naturally; for looke
how generall the hatred of
man is, so generall is the purpose
of mischiefe against
those that professe religion:
for all men by nature are haters
of Gods Church, & people;
so Christ saith to his disciples,
Matth. 24. 9. 
                     yee shall be be hated of all



nations for my names sake;
                     Ioh. 16. 2. Yea,
whosoeuer killeth you shall thinke
that he doth God good seruice,
and therefore this thought of
doing mischiefe is as general,
euen in the minde of euery
man by nature. This further
appeareth by the continuall
persecution, that hath euer
beene raised agaiust Gods
poore Church, since the beginning
of the world: It began
at Abell, soone after the
giuing of the couenant of
grace to our first parents, and
hath continued to this day, &
shall abide vnto the end: so
that if carnall men could look
into their owne hearts, they
should there behold this murdering
thought against Gods
people. This murdering
thought commeth from another
wicked imagination, set



downe by S. Peter: who
bringeth in the wicked of
this world,1. Pet. 4. 3. 4. 
                     thinking it a
strange thing, that Gods children
doe not, as they doe, and
runne not with them vnto all excesse
of riot: liuing in drunkennes,
fornication, and such other abhominations;
for this cause doe
they cōceiue hatred, and purpose
mischeife against Gods
people, and so will continue,
till God giue them grace to
repent. If any shall say this
thought is not generall, for
Nabuched-nezer
                     Danie. 2. 48. an heathen
man shewed fauour to Daniell,
and highly aduanced him. I answer,
it is true he did so; but
that was a worke of Gods speciall
providence who procured
him fauour, and disposed
the kings heart to affect him,
as he did also the heart of the



chiefeDaniel. 1. 9. 
                     Eunuch; Otherwise
Nabuchad-nezzer naturally
did nothing but intend mischeife
against Gods Church,
as his rage against the three
children did euidētly bewray,
Dan. 3. 19.
                  A third example of this
murthering thought I adde,
which every minister of gods
word may obserue by daily
experience, and that is this;
when mens faults are particularly
rebuked in the ministery
of the word, and the quicke,
as it were touched by applying
the word to the cōsciēce;
then will the heart of a naturall
man, thus conceiue of the
minister that reprooueth sinn;
This man meaneth me, he hath
some spyte, and mallice against
me, that he thus reprooveth my
particular faults; when as the



minister knew them not to be
his personall sinnes: but it is
the power of the word that
ransaketh the sinfull heart:
this is the fault of all carnall
hearers, who will heare quietly
till their faults be rebuked,
but then they thinke maliciously
of the preacher;
Thus Herod dealt with Iohn
Baptist, he heard him gladly
for a while, Mark. 6. 20. but
when he was rebuked for his
brother Phillips wife then he cast
Iohn in prison: Luk. 3. 19. 20.
And if conscience might bee
iudge, many an hearer would
be found to haue an Herods
heart towards Gods minister.
               
               
                  Sect. 3. Of thoughts of Adulterie;
theft; & disgrace.
                  
                     
The third thought of man
touching his neighbour, is the
thought of Adulterie; which
is the thought with consent
to any vnchastitie. Such a
thought had Iudah cōcerning
Tamar his daughter-in lawe,
whenGen. 38. 15. 16. 
                     he iudged her an whore;
and desired to lie with her. And
with such thoughts was Ammons
2. Sam. 13. 2. heart so sore vexed
that hee fell sicke for his sister
Tamar: This makes a man an
Adulterer in heart before
God, though actually he commit
not the fact: Mat. 5. 28.
                  The fourth is the thought
of Theft, which is the thought
with consent of beguyling or



wronging another in his
goods or substāce. This is that
Imagining of iniquitie, and working
of wickednes vpon their
beds, in coueting of fields—against
which
                     Micah. 2. 1. Micah pronounceth
a woe. And this
thought also possesseth their
hearts, that with the wicked
Israelites wish the time were
come, wherein theyAmos. 8. 5. 
                     might
make the Epha small and the
Shekell great, that is, lessen the
measure, and inhance the
pryce, and falsifie the weights by
deceit.
                  
                  The first euill thought is
a thought of disgrace, which
some way tendeth to the reproach,
and debasing of our neighbours
good name; as when a thing is
well done, to thinke & iudge
it to bee ill done, or when a
thing is a misse to iudge it



worse then it is: Thus Elie
thought disgracefullie of
Hannah deeming her to bee
dronke, saying,1. 8. am. 1. 13 14. 
                     put away thy
dronkennes, when shee prayed
deuoutly from av. 15. 
                     troubled
soule to the Lord; Thus Eliab
Dauids eldest brother
thought disgracefullie of
Dauid, when he shewed himselfe
willing to encounter
with Golyah that reuiled the
hoast of the liuing God saying;
1. Sam. 17. 28 
                     I know the pride and mallice
of thine heart that thou art
come to see the Battell, when as
indeede the spirit of God put
that motion into his heart to
take away the shame from
Israell, as the happie euent
declared plainly. So when
our sauiour Christ spake most
comfortably to the sicke of
the Palsie, saying,Math. 9. 2 
                     be of good



comfort thy sinnes are forgiuen
thee; then the cursed hearts
of the wicked Pharisies
thought thus in themselues, u
                     this man blasphemeth.
                     v. 4. And
when the gift of the holie
Ghost, was sent vpon the Apostles,
causing them to
speake strange tounges to the
great admiration of men of
diuers nations, then some of
the malicious Iewes thought they
were dronke, saying scoffingly,
they were full of newe wine.
                     Act. 2. 13. And
this thought of disgrace is in
euery man naturally bringing
forth continually the fruits of
disgrace, as Enuie, Strife, Emulations,
Dissentions, and Debates:
for loue thinketh not euill;
but naturally true loue is
wanting in all men: and therfore
they cannot but thinke
euill of others.
                  
                     
We see the fiue euill thoughts
of mans naturall heart against
his neighbour; touching
which two things are yet further
to bee skanned, to wit,
when these euill thoughtes
doe arise in the minde; and
in whome they are. For the
first: it is true, that they doe
not at all times arise in mens
mindes, but then onely when
occasion is giuen, at which
time they arise so soone as it
is giuen: for mans heart is
like to tinder, or drie wood,
which burneth not of it selfe,
but so soone as fire is put to
it, then presently it kindleth.
When you come to talke
with a naturall man, it may be
for the present, hee thinketh
not to lie; but giue him occasion
to lie, and then hee soone
bethinkes himselfe therof &



will not spare to vtter it if it
may make for his aduantage.
And the like wee may say of
malice, Adulterie, Theft, disgrace
or any other sinne against
our neighbour: Doe
but minister occasion there about
to the naturall heart of
man, & he thinketh of them,
and without Gods grace restraining,
or renuing him, will
bring forth the same in action.
                  
                     The second point. In whom
are all these euill thoughts?
Answ. In all men naturallie
without exception, till they
be renewed by Gods speciall
grace: Yea the truth is, these
thoughts doe euery where abound;
for looke what men
doe practise, that first of all
they thinke, for the thought
is the beginning of euery



action; But in the worlde all
sins against the second Table,
doe abound, as the practise
of Dishonour, of Murther, Adulterie,
Thefts, and Disgraces,
and therefore these euill
thoughts from whence these
actions come, must needes be
common.
                  
                     Vse. By this wee may see
what a huge masse of corruption
the naturall heart of man
is, without gods special grace;
for thoughts of dishonour
make a mans heart a pallace
of prid like the table of Adoni-bezek:
Also thoughts of
crueltie make mans heart a
slaughterhouse: Thoughts of
Adulterie make it a most filthie
stewes: Thoughts of theft
make it to become a denne of
theeues, wherein all manner
of fraud, and bad dealing is



plotted & devised: And lastly
thoughts of Disgrace make
                        •
                     
it a fountaine of backbyting,
debate, slander, and reuiling:
And therfore howsoeuer the
outward life may be ordered
ciuillie, yet without Gods
grace mans heart is most vile:
And those that pleade their
good nature, and good meaning,
are heere confuted, for
naturally the heart, thinkes all
euill against his neighbour.
               
            
            
               CHAP. V.
               Of mans naturall thoughts
concerning himselfe.
               
                  Sect. 1. Mans proud thought of his
owne excellencie.
                  THe third kinde of mans
naturall euill thoughtes,
are such as concerne himselfe,



& they are principally foure.
                  The first may fitlie bee termed
a thought of Pride, wherby
euerie man naturallie
thinkes himselfe most excellent,
and far to exceede all other
men whatsoeuer: thus
the Prophet Isay bringeth in
Babylō speaking in her heart,
that is, thinking,Isay. 14. 1
                           •
                        . 
                     I will ascend
into heauen, and exalt my
throne aboue or besides the stars
of God, as if shee should thinke
with her selfe, I am farre more
excellent then any other what soeuer,
& therefore I am to bee exalted
from the earth to heauen,
and to bee matched with
God himselfe. And the Prophet
Zephame bringeth in Ni
                        •
                     iue
speaking thus in her heart,Zeph. 2. 
                           ••
                        . 
                     I
am, and there is none besides me:
And so the proud Pharisie in
his priuate, and secret prayer



to God sayeth,Luke 18. 11. 
                     I thanke thee
Lorde, that I am not as other
men, meaning that he is more
excellent: And the whore of
Babylō
                     The Hereticall Church of Rome. is brought in saying
of her selfe,Reuel. 18. 71 
                     I sit as a Queene,
and am no widdowe and shall see
no mourning. All which places
shew this to bee the nature of
man, to exalt himselfe in his
owne heart, aboue all others.
If any shall say, heereby no
more can bee prooued but
that this thought is in some
proud and insolent persons; I
adde therfore, that as our first
Parents in the beginning, did
learne that proud lessō of the
divell, Ye shall be as Gods: so we
being in their loynes when
they sinned, and descending
from them by ordinarie gineration,
doe together with
our nature receiue that corruption



from them, whereby
wee thinke thus proudly of
our selues, that we far excell others
and are as little Gods on
earth in respect of others. Indeede
the most will say for
themselues, wee abhorre this
proude thought, neither did
wee euer finde it to bee in vs:
But we must know that the lesser
we discern it in our selues,
the more it reigneth in our
hearts; and the more wee discerne,
and bewaile it, the lesser
place it taketh in vs.
                  Now touching this thought
of pride, two things must bee
obserued: the danger, and the
highest degree of it.The danger of this thought. For the
danger of this thought; The
outward affecting of strange
fashions in apparell is a wonderfull
pride; But the most
vile and wretched pride of all,



is that spirituall pride of the
heart whereby a man despiseth
all other, in regarde of
himselfe, and thinketh himselfe
far better then any. This
I manifest by sundrie reasons,
as first, from the fruites of this
inward pride: for hence doe
slowe many damnable sinnes;
in mens liues and conuersations:Fruites of inward pride.
                      as first, Ambition, whereby
men are not content with
that estate, wherewith God
hath belssed them: but doe
seeke by all meanes to bee advanced
to higher dignitie &
 estate. Secondly, Presumption,
whereby men dare enterprise
things beyond their calling,
and aboue their power, taking
vppon them more then
 they are able for. Thirdly, boasting,
wherby a man speaks of
himselfe more then is seemely,



& extolleth himselfe aboue
his desert. Fourthly, Hipocrysie,
when a man pretendeth he
hath that grace, and religion 
which indeed he hath not, or
els maketh shew of more
grace then is truly in him.
Fiftly, Obstniacie, when a
man persisteth in an errour, & 
will not yeeld to the truth,
though it be manifested vnto
him. Sixtly, Contention, wherby
men striue one against another
in word or deed, without 
relenting. And lastly,
Affectation of Novelties, especially 
in outward attyre, for
when a mans cōceiues so highly
of himselfe, then withall
he thinkes no manner of attyre
good enough to bewtifie,
and adorne his body; and
so begins to deuise, and affect
strange and forraigne attyre.
                  
                     
                      Secondly, the danger hereof
appeareth hence, that
where this thought of pride
raigneth (as it doth in all men
naturally) there the spirit of
grace dwelleth not: Mary in
her song saith well,Luk. 1. 51. 
                     God scattereth
the Imaginations of the
proud, that is, of those which
haue this cōceit of their owne
excellencie aboue others: and
S. Iames;
                     Iam. 4. 6. 
                     God resisteth the
proud, and giueth grace to the
humble: yea, thus saith he
                     Isa. 57. 15. 
                     that
is high and excellent: he that inhabiteth
eternitie, whose name is
the holy one: I dwell in the high
& holy place, with him also that is
of a contrite and humble spirit,
to reuiue the spirit of the humble:
But he that lifteth vp himselfe
his minde is not vpright
in him, Habak. 2, 4.
                  
                      Thirdly, such is the danger



of this sinne, that when all other
sinnes die in a man, this
thought of pride dyeth not:
nay, when other sinnes are
mortified, and Gods graces
come in stead thereof, yet this
will then reuiue, and make
the graces of God, matter
whereon to worke: as when
an ignorant person attaines
to some knowledge; this
pride will take occasion from
that gift of God to puffe vp
the heart; yea when a man in
true humilitie of heart shall
renounce the actions of pride,
yet thē wil pride be working,
for this is a fruit of pride to
thinke well of our selues, because
we are not proud,The height of this thought
                  
                  
                     II. Point. The highest degree
of this pride is, when a
man thinketh himselfe to
bee equall with God. This



is a most notorious, nay
an abhominable height of
pride; and yet the truth is,
some men haue come herevnto.
Thus the king of Babel
thought of himselfe, when he
said in his heart,Isa. 14. 14. 
                     I will ascend
aboue the height of the clowdes
and will be like the most high. It
may seeme strange that men
should thinke thus of themselues;
but we must know, that
men may doe it two waies;
first, when they thinke they
haue power of themselues,
whereby they are able to
match or counteruaile the
power of God: so thought
Nabuchad-nezar whē he said,
Daniel. 3 15. 
                     who is that god, that can deliuer
you out of my hand? such a
thought had proud Pharao in
his heart, when he said to
Moses & Aaron,Exod. 5. 2. 
                     who is the



Lord that I should heare his
voice, & let Israel goe? Secondly,
when they take to themselues
the honour of God, and
thinke it to be due to them:
Thus did Herod
                     Act. 12. 22. when by silence
he approued the blasphemous
voice of the people,
who cried vnto him, the
voice of God, and not of man.
And thus Antichrist sitting in
the temple of God,2. Thess. 2. 4. 
                     exalts
himselfe aboue all that is called
God, or worshipped: Now that
man of sinne is the Pope of
Rome; for howsoeuer in
word he humble himselfe, &
call himselfe the seruant of
seruants; yet indeede through
the pride of his heart, he sitteth
as God, taking vnto himself
that honour which is proper
to God:Bellar. de Rom. pontil. lib. 4. for he claimeth
power to prescribe new rules



of Gods worship, to forgiue
sinnes, to make lawes to bind
the conscience properly, yea
to open, and shut heauen, and
to dispose at his pleasure of
earthly kingdomes; he taketh
vpon him to dispence with
the morall lawe, and with
Apostolicall constitutions: all
which belong to God alone,
and none dare claime
them to belong vnto him,
but he that matcheth himselfe
with God; and this is the
highest decree of pride.
                  
                     The Vse. By this euery man
may see what he is of himselfe,
what a cursed and proud
nature he carrieth about with
him: for euery man naturally
when occasion is offered
thinks highly of himselfe, and
basely of others in regard of
himselfe. Let vs therefore



take notice of this Satanicall
pride that is in our nature, and
striue against it, for who
would not be ashamed to
say with the proud Pharasie,
I thanke thee Lord, I am not as
other men, &c. or with the arrogant
Iewes, stand apart,
touch me not, I am holier then
thou, Isay. 65. 5.
               
               
                  Sect. 2. Mans thought of
his owne righteousnes.
                  The second euill thought
concerning a mans selfe is
this, I am sufficiently righteous,
and I need no repentance. That
this is the thought of euerie
man naturally appeareth by
the Lords commandement
to the people of Israell, forbidding
them to say in their
hearts, when they were placed



in the promised land,Deut. 9. 4.
that for their owne righteousnes
the Lord brought them in to
possesse it. Wherby he giueth
vs to vnderstand two things:
First, that as the Iewes did
there, so euerie man thinks
himself to be righteous. And
secondly he thinks that God
doth giue his blessings vnto
him for his owne righteousnes:
for the Lord vseth not to
forbidde such a thought as
men naturally haue not in
them: so in like manner when
Ieremie rebuked the people
for their sinnes, they said,Ierem. 2. 35.
                     they were Innocent and guiltles,
they had not sinned: And the
Church of Laodicea saith
thus of her selfe,Rev. 3. 17. 
                     I am rich
and neede nothing; that is, I abound
in spirituall graces.
This is the thought of the



proudLuk. 18. 9. 10. 
                     Pharisie, who trusts in
himselfe that he is iust, and
therfore braggeth vnto God,
that he is not such and such,
but he doth this, and that, he
fasteth, he giueth Almes, paieth
tithes, &c. and in plaine
tearmes his heart saith this,
I am righteous, I neede no repentance:
for of such Christ spake
when he said,Matht. 9. 18. 
                     he came not to
call the righteous but sinners to
repentance. And againe, I say
vnto you,
                     Luk. 15. 7. 
                     that ioy shall be in heauen
for one sinner that conuerteth,
more then for ninetie and
nine iust men which need none
amendment of life: where we
must obserue that Christ meaneth
not, that there are in
deede some so righteous, that
they neede no amendment;
but he speaketh according to



the opinion, which some haue
of themselues, to witte, that
they are righteous, and neede
no repentance: by all which
it is more then manifest that
this is a naturall thought of a
man concerning himselfe.
                  This euill thought raigneth
in our age and time as all
the former doe:Examination for this thought. for come to
an ignorant man that hath
not beene instructed in religion,
reason with him touching
his estate, and aske him whether
he can keepe the law of
God or not; he will answer,
he can; he loueth the lord his
God with all his heart, and
his neighbour as himselfe:
Aske him how hee lookes to
be saued; his answer is by his
owne righteousnes, and for
his owne goodnesse. If due examination
were made, this



would be found to be the
thought of many that liue in
the Church among vs; and
there is none by nature free
from this thought.
                  Hereby then we may see
that the thoughts of euery
man, be he what he will, are
plaine papistry, for Poperie
is naturall: One chiefe pillar
and ground thereof is Iustification,
and saluation by workes;
which opinion euery man
brings with him from his
mothers wombe: And so it is
in the point of merit, men
naturally thinke they receiue
the good things which they
haue from God, for their own
righteousnes.
                  Secondly, hence it appeareth
that it is a matter of
great difficultie, to bring a
man throughly to renounce



his owne righteousnes and
soundly, and heartily to imbrace
true religion, and the
righteousnes of Christ by
faith. This is no lesse then the
change of Nature; and yet
this must euery man doe, that
will be saued, he must be
come nothing in himselfe,
that he may be all in Christ
Iesus; which is as impossible to
nature, as to change water into
fire, and therfore men
had need to beware how
they put off the time, & neglect
the meanes in which
God shewes his power in
working this change in the
hearts of his elect.
                  Thirdly, hence we see the
euident cause of that preposterous
course of the world,
which most men take in spending
their witte, and strength,



some for riches, others for honours
and pleasures, and in
the meane while they can
spare no time for religion, to
seeke Gods fauour in Christ,
and the graces of the spirit: It
may bee they will afford a
good worde vnto Religion,
but yet they regarde it not in
respect of other things. And
this is the behauiour not of
some few, but of all sorts, and
degrees of men naturally.
Now the cause heereof is this
cursed euill thought, whereby
men perswade themselues,
they be righteous, and need no repentance,
and till this thought
be rooted out of mans heart,
he will neuer value the word
and religion of God according
to the worth thereof, so
as with the good Marchant
he wil part with al that he hath,



rather then he wiil be frustrate of
this pearle. Math. 13. 45, 46. Indeede
men vse to pleade thus
for themselues; wee confesse
our selues to be sinners, and
therefore wee cannot thinke
such a wicked thought, that we
need no repentance; But we must
knowe, that both these may
well stand together, in the
wicked heart of man; he may
confesse himselfe to bee a sinner,
and yet thinke that hee is
righteous: for is not this▪ the
cōmon practise to make great
sins, little sins & little sins, no
sins? Doe not men cloath vice
in vertues robe, and turne out
vertue in the rotten ragges of
vice? Is not drunkennes counted
good fellowship, & kinde
neighbourhood? Is not swearing
made the token of a
braue minde, and Pride counted



decencie; and fornication,
but a tricke of youth; and couetousnes
esteemed good
thrift, and carefulnes? On the
other side, is not the more
sincere profession of religion
termed precysenes, Puritanisme,
Hypocrisie, and such
like? doth not hee that refrayneth
the common sinnes
of the time, make himselfe a
pray to the mouthes of the
vngodly? Nowe where these
things are, though the mouth
say, I am a sinner; yet the heart
thinketh I am righteous, and so
it is apparant this thought is
common among vs.
               
               
                  Sect. 3. Mans thought of securitie
in the day of peace.
                  The third euill thought concerning



a mans selfe is, a
thought of securitie; in the time
of peace and prosperitie, men
say thus in their hearts, I am
free from all Gods iudgements, I
am in no danger of hell, death, or
damnation, but sure enough of
saluation. It may bee thought,
that none is so bewitched of
the deuill, as to haue this conceit
of himselfe, but the scripture
is most plaine in the
proofe hereof: Psal. 10. 6. The
wicked man, (such as is euery
man by nature, as wee shewed
before) saith in his heart, I shall
neuer be mooued nor bee in danger.
And the Prophet Isaiah
brings in wicked men saying,
Isaiah. 28. 15. 
                     we haue made a couenant
with death, and with hell wee are
at agreement: which must not
be vnderstood as done indeed
(for death, and hell will make



league with none) but onely
in mens wicked Imagination,
perswading themselues,
that they bee in no danger of
hell, or of the graue: for so
much the next wordes import,
that, though a scourge
runne ouer & passe thorough, yet
it shall not come at vs: yea righteous
Dauid was ouertaken
heerewith, for in his prosperitie
he said in his heart,Psal. 30. 6. 
                     I shall
neuer bee mooued; much more
then is it the thought of euerie
naturall man, to say with
the rich foole vpō the increase
of outward blessings,Luk. 12. 1
                           •
                        . 
                     soule,
soule, take thine ease, thou hast
enough, nothing can hurt thee.
                  
                  
                     The vse: By this wee may
come to the knowledge of a
thing which falleth out in all
ages worth our diligent obseruation.
It hath pleased god



from time, to time to send his
prophets and ministers to call
his people to repentance: thus
did Isay, Ieremy, Ioell, Amos, &
the rest; yea the Lorde himselfe
(asZeph. 3. 5. Zephanie saith) riseth euery
morning, and bringeth his
iudgementes to light, which
should turne men from their
sinnes, hee faileth not, and yet
the wicked will not learne to be
ashamed.
                  
                  To come to our owne
times: it hath pleased God to
stirre vp many worthie ministers
vnto vs, who spende
their time, and strength, in labouring
to bring men to repentance,
and saluation; but
yet who is he almost that turneth
from his sinnes? yea the
Lord himselfe, as in former
times, so nowe doth preach
from heauen by his iudgements,



as famine, plague, &c:
and yet by lamentable experience,
wee see that the bodie
of our people remaine secure,
they areIer. 48. 11. 
                     setled on their lees,
and
                     Zeph. 1. 12. 
                     frozen in their dregges:
no man stirreth vp himselfe
to say,Ier. 8. 6. 
                     what haue I done? now
the cause heereof is nothing
els, but this cursed thought of
securitie, whereby a man saith
thus in his heart, I am free from
Gods iudgements. Read Matth.
2
                        •
                     . 37. As it was in the daies of
Noah (saith our Sauiour
Christ) so shall it bee in the daies
of the comming of the sonne of
man: they did eate, drinke, marrie
wiues, and giue in marriage,
and knewe nothing till Noah entred
into the Arke, and the floode
came and tooke them all away.
Quest. Howe could it be, that
they should knowe nothing



seeing Noah had preached
vnto them of the floode an
hundred and twentie yeares
before? Ans. Surely it was as
if they had knowne nothing,
for they would not beleeue
him, it would not sinke into
their heads, much lesse settle
in their hearts, that GOD
would destroy all the worlde
by waters: and so may it bee
saide of these times; wee knowe
nothing; though wee be called
to repentance by the ministerie
of the worde, yet we will
not repent; and though wee
heare of Gods iudgements,
we thinke our selues free from
them, and will not beleeue till
the beesome of his wrath
sweepe vs all away,Remedie. as the
flood did the old world.
                  Wherefore to redresse among
vs this damnable



thought of securitie, let vs
consider our grieuous sinnes
in particular, and set before
our eyes the curse of God,
both temporall iudgements,
and eternall death, due vnto
vs for the same. It is the applying
of Gods heauie wrath
that must make vs shake off
this secure Thought, which
the rather we must do, though
it be grieuous to the flesh, and
as a pange vnto death in a naturall
man, because till this
thought bee remooued, the
sauing graces of Gods spirite
will not take rooting in our
hearts.
               
               
                  Sect. 4. Mans faint thoughts in time
of distresse.
                  The fourth and last euill
thought of mans heart touching
himselfe is this; In time



of miserie hee saith, his crosses
are greater and worser then indeede
they are. So Iobe complaineth
in his affliction, that
Iob. 6. 2. 3. 
                     his griefe & miserie was heauier
then the sand of the sea
shoare. And the Church in
great affliction calls thus to
passengers,Lam. 1. 12. 
                     Behold, and see if
there be any sorrowe like vnto my
sorrowe which is done vnto mee.
And that it is the thought of
euery mans heart naturally,
appeareth by experience: for
let a man bee in distresse outwardly,
or else touched in cō
                     science
for his sinnes, when
you shall labour to minister
comfort vnto him according
to Gods worde; hee will answer,
that neuer any was in like

                           •
                        ase to him, so grieuously tormented
& afflicted as he is. And indeede
it is the propertie of



mans naturall heart, to esteeme
Ionah. 4. 8▪ 9▪
                      little crosses to be exceeding
great, yea oftentimes
to deeme that to bee a crosse
which is none at all: the reason
is, the want of iudgement
rightly to discerne the state
of their affliction, and the
want of strength to support it
as it is: for if thou be faint in
the day of aduersitte thy strength
is small.
                  
                  For the remedie of this euill
thought,Prou. 24. 10. first wee must seeke
to rectifie the Imagination,
by bringing the minde to a
right con
                        •
                     eit of the affliction:
this is a special course to be
obserued in dealing with thē
that bee oppressed with any
distresse: for a strong conceit
of a mans owne miserie doth
many times more hurt, then
the miserie it selfe: therefore



be sure the iudgement be well
informed, and then the cure
is halfe wrought, and the
crosse halfe remooued. This
done, the partie afflicted may
well consider the desert of
sinne, in the endlesse torments
of the damned, which the
Lord preuenteth in his children
by temporall chastisements
in this life:1. Cor. 11. 32 
                     for when we
are iudged wee are chastened of
the Lorde, that wee might not be
condemned with the world: And
so labouring to bee humbled
for sinne, and to lay hold on
gods mercy in christ, through
whom all things, euen afflictions,
worke together for
the best, no doubt he will bee
able to say,Mich. 7. 9. 
                     I will beare the
wrath of the Lorde, because I
haue sinned against him and
                     Psal. 43. 5.
                     why art thou cast downe oh my



soule, why art thou so disquieted
within me? wayte on God; for I
will yet giue him thankes; he is
my present helper and my God.
Thus much of mans euill
thoughts concerning himselfe.
               
            
            
               CHAP. VI.
               Of the want of good thoughts in
euery man naturally
               
                  Sect. I. Good thoughts about temporall
things be much
wanting.
                  HAuing spoken of mans
naturall euill thoughts
concerning God, his neighbour,
and himselfe: we come
to the second point to be observed
in the text; to wit, That
there is a want of good thoughts
and consideration in euery 
                           ••
                        an



naturally: for the Lord here
faith, his thoughts are evill from
his youth.; and Chap. 6. 5. They
are onely euill euery day: now
looke where euill is onely and
continually, there good must
needes be wāting altogether.
                  This want must be considered
either in respect of temporall,
or of spirituall things. By
Temporall things I meane such
worldly affaires and actions
as concerne mans naturall
life; wherein though good
consideration be not taken
quite away, yet wee must
know that the same is corrupt,
and very weake and imperfect,
even as reason is; and
there is much want in euery
man in this behalfe.Eccles. 4. 8. 
                     There is
one alone (saith, Salomon) and
there is not a second: which hath
neither sonne nor brother, yet



there is none end of his travell,
neither can his eye bee satisfied
with riches; neither doth hee
thinke for whom doe I travell—?
heere behold a notable example
of this want of good
consideration about earthly
things; that a man should
spend both his wit & strength
in heaping vp riches, and
knowes not to whom he shall
leaue them. But we need not
be inquisitiue for examples:
for we may daily obserue in
our selues and others apparent
want of good consideration
in these worldly affaries:
which must not seeme strange
vnto vs, seeing that reason it
selfe, the ground of cōsideration
is greatly blemished,
through the corruption of nature,
about these earthly
things.
               
               
                  
                  Sect. 2. Good thoughts in matters spirituall
be altogether wanting.
                  In things spirituall which
concerne the kingdome of
God, there is in our nature an
absolute want of good consideration,
herein of our selues
we haue no good thoughts:
we are not of our selues (saith2. Cor. 3. 5.
Paul.) sufficient to thinke any
thing, that is, any good thing,
as of our selues: The whole bodie
of the Gospell is therefore
called a mystery, because the
things therein contained and
revealed are such as,1. Cor. 2. 9. 
                     neuer
came into mans heart to thinke.
This want we may obserue
especially in foure things: 1.
in respect of Gods presence
and prouidence: 2. of Gods
Iudgements: 3. of our owne



sinnes: 4, of our dutie to God.
                  First. man by nature doth
not thinke of,The first good thought wanting. or consider Gods
presence and prouidence to behold
and to remember all his
waies in thought, word, and
deed: hereof the Lord complaines
against Ephraim and
Samaria,Hos. 7. 1. 2. saying; they haue
dealt falsely—and they consider
not in their hearts that
I remember all their wickednes:
And the same is the
state of euery naturall man
beeing left to himselfe; for all
by nature are equally corrupt
with originall sinne, and
so are destitute of this good
thought: which yet may appeare
the more plaine by this,
that naturally mans heart is
possessed of the cleane contrary,
to wit, God shall not see,
God will not regard, as hath



beene shewed before.Pag. 39. 37. And
indeed it is a worke of grace
to haue the heart rightly affected
with this thought,
God beholds all my waies, he
considers and remembers euery
thing I doe; flesh and blood
can not attaine vnto it.
                  Secondly, a man by nature
doth not consider or
thinke of the Iudgements of
God,
                     The second good thought wanting. temporall and eternall
due vnto sinne: This thought
was wanting in the men of
the old world, though Noah
preached vnto them an hundred
and twentie yeares of the
gecerall deluge, yet the consideration
of it tooke no place
in their hearts; and therefore
it is said,Matth. 24. 38. 39. 
                     they knew nothing
till the flood came and tooke them
all away: from the want of
this thought it came to passe,



thatGen. 19. 14. 
                     Lotts sonnes—in lawe,
thought their father had but
mocked, when he told them that
God would destroy Sodom. Hence
it was that theLuk. 12. 
                           ••
                        . 
                     Rich foole

said vnto him,vers. 20. 
                     O foole, this
night will they fetch away thy
soule. And shall wee thinke this
thought is now wanting at
this day, seeing Christ hath
said,Mat. 25. 37. 
                     as it was in the daies of
Noe, so shall it bee at the comming
of the sonne of man?
                  
                  
                     Thirdly, a man naturally
doth neuer bethinke himselfe,The third good thought wanting.
of his owne sinnes; he hath no
purpose of heart seriously to
examine his life past, or to repent
of such sinnes as he findeth
in him: This appeareth



by the Lords own complaint
against the Iewes, who were
so farre from turning frō their
sins, that not one would say in
his heart,
                     Ier. 8. 6. what haue I done?
nay, when they had cōmitted
most sottish Idolatrie,
                     Isay. 44. 16. 17. 19. 20. in making
an Idoll God of one part of a
tree, with the other part thereof
they had rosted their meate and
warmed themselues, yet they
considered not this in their hearts,
neither had they knowledge or
vnderstanding to say, I haue
burnt halfe of it in the fire, I
haue baked bread vpon the coales
thereof; I haue roasted flesh, and
eaten it; and shall I make the residue
thereof an Abhomination?
                  Fourthly,The fourth good thought wanting. a naturall man
doth not consider what duty &
seruice he owes vnto God: his
mind is wholly bent to his



owne waies, but theMat. 25. 18.

                     foolish virgins did content
themselues with the blasing
Lamp of an outward profession,
and neuer be-thought
themselues of that oyle of
grace, which God required
in all those, that would enter
with Christ into his bridechamber,
till it was too late:
And the sleight seruing of
God at this day, declares the
generall want of this cōsideration.
               
               
                  Sect. 3. The fruit of this want of
good thoughts.
                  
                     
Heere further wee must
know that this want of good
consideration is a grieuous
evill and a mother sinne, from
whence as from a fountaine,
streames of corruptions and
transgressions both of heart
and life doe issue forth; first,
hereby we are disabled from
yelding vnto God that obedience
of heart which his law
requireth; for how can
we loue the Lord with all our
thought and mind; & our neighbour
as our selues, as GodLuk. 10. 27.
commandeth, when as naturally
our hearts are void of
all good thoughts towards
God, and towards our neighbours?
Againe, whence
comes sinning with an high



hand, when men sinne, and
will sinne? whence comes it
that men blesse themselus in
their sinnes, and flatter themselues
in their owne eies,
while they goe on in sinne,
but from want of consideration
of Gods presence, and of
Gods iudgements? This Abraham
knew well, and therfore
saide of the people of
Gerar, because
                     Gen. 20. 11. 
                     they wanted the
feare of God, that is, all consideration
of Gods presence,
and of Gods iudgements,
therefore they would kill him for
his wiues sake. Whence also
comes that sensualitie, whereby
men addict them-selues
wholly to the profits, pleasures,
and honours of this
world, neuer minding heauen
or hell, but from want of consideration
of their dutie to



God? If men did vse to call
themselues to accompt for
their sinnes, or did set before
their eyes the iudgements of
God due vnto them, it could
not be that there shoud be
such want of contrition towards
God, or of compassion
towards their brethren, as
euery where abounds. And
the like might be said of many
other capitall sinnes, all
which proceede from the
want of good consideration.
Where, by the way, we may
obserue, that our common
people doe farre deceiue
themselues in this perswasion
of themselues, that by nature
they haue good hearts, and
good meaning: If you charge
them with the sinnes of their
liues, they will straightway
plead their good intention, and



say, though they sometime
faile in action, yet they meane
well alwaies. But the truth is,
naturally well meaning, and
good consideration, spirituall
thinges is altogether wanting.
And therfore while men
doe soothe vp themselues in
their good meaning, they
deceiue their owne hearts
through ignorance of their
naturall estate: and they must
knowe, that they can neuer
come vnto Christ that they
might haue life, till they be
quite gone out of themselues
in regard of such conceits.

doctrine.
               
                  Sect. 1. That the Scripture is
the word of God.
                  
                     
Hauing seene what euill
thoughts be in euery
man naturally, & what good
thoughts be wanting in him:
it followeth now to make
some vse of this doctrine concerning
mans naturall Imaginations.
                  The first vse shall be against
all Atheists, who thinke the
Scripture to be meere policie,
deuised by man to keepe
men in awe. But we are to
know, that the holy Scripture
is no deuise of man, but the
very word of the euerliuing
God; which I thus demonstrate
out of the former doctrine:
The Scripture saith in
generall, that all the Imaginations
of euery naturall man
are euill and that continually.



Nowe it doth not onely affirme
this in generall, but declares
it also in particular; for
elsewhere it sheweth what
those particular euill thoughts
be, which the naturall minde
of man frameth concerning
God, his neighbour, and himselfe.
Againe, the same Scripture
saith in generall, That
good thoughts and considerations,
are naturally wanting in
euery man; and elsewhere it
declareth in particular what
those good thoughts be
which enter not into the
mind of a natural man: both
these haue bin plainly shewed
out of the word of God.
Nowe herevpon it doth necessarily
follow that the
scripture is the word of God:
for let the cunning Atheist
shew whence it is that the



scripture doth declare mans
thoughts; hee cannot say, of
man; for no man knoweth
the thoughts of another; nay
he cannot finde out his owne
thoughts: neither can hee ascribe
it to any angell good or
bad; for the minde of man is
hid from them; they knowe
not mans thoughts. It remaineth
therefore, that as God
alone is the searcher of the
hearts, so that Scripture
which declareth vnto man
what bee his thoughts, is the
onely word of the same God;
Indeed God vsed man for his
instrument, in the penning and
deliuerie of the scripture, but
hee himselfe by his spirite is
the sole author thereof.
               
               
                  Sect. 2. That man hath no free will
to good by nature.
                  
                     
The second vse shall bee against
the Papists, who ascribe
to mans will a naturall
power to that which is truly
good,Bellarm. de grat & lib. arbit. l. 16. c 15. sect. 10. as by it selfe to co-worke
with Gods grace in the first act
of mans conuersion. But the
charge of euill heere layd vpon
the frame of mans naturall
heart by God himselfe, doth
teach vs otherwise: for looke
howe farre the frame of the
minde, which is the principall
part of the soule, is corrupt
for thoughts and Imaginations,
so farre is the will,
the inferiour part of the soule
corrupt in willing. But the
minde is naturally so corrupt
that it can not thinke a good
thought, and therefore answerably
the will by nature is so
corrupt, that it can not will
that which is truly good. If it



be said, that man hath libertie
of will in humane actions
and in ciuill duties: Answ. he
hath, but yet such actions
proceeding from a corrupt
fountaine, are sinnes in euery
naturall man, howsoeuer for
the matter of the works they
may be called good, beeing
such as God himselfe ordained.
               
               
                  Sect. 3. Of the timely preuenting and
suppressing of wicked Imaginations
                  The third vse shall be for
admonition vnto them, to
whome is committed the education
of youth, as Parents
Masters, Tutors, &c. that seeing
the imaginations of mans
heart are euill from his youth,
therefore they must all ioyne
hand in hand betime to stop



vp, or at least to lessen this
corrupt fountaine. Parents
must sow the seedes of grace
into the minds of their young
children, that if it were possible,
euen at their mothers
breasts they might be nourished
in the faith. Thus dealt
Lois and Eunice with their
young Timothie: for Paul
saith;2. Tim. 3. 15. 
                     he learned the holy Scriptures
                     
                        
                           〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                        . 
                     of an infant. Then as
their children grow in descretion
and vse of reason, they
must beEph. 6. 4. nurtered in religion,
and haue the grounds thereof
by often repetition driuen
into their hearts: for this is
the best meanes to free their
minds, though not altogether
from naturall Imaginations,
yet from the force and poison
thereof: forPro 22. 15. 
                     follie is bound
to the heart of a childe, but the



rodde of teaching, that is, instruction
with correction, will
driue it away from him: yea,
when as thePro. 29. 15 
                     child set at libertie
makes his mother ashamed.
yet willIbid. 27. 
                     the sonne that is well
instructed, giue his father rest, &
yeild delight vnto his soule. Further,
where Parents leaue,
there Maisters and Tutours
must take hold, building vp
that good foundation which
is layde to their hand, that by
them also the streame of mans
naturall Imaginations may
bee stopped: yea, though parents
should neglect this dutie
towards their owne children,
as too many doe at this
day, yet each godly master, if
hee desire to haue Gods
church in his house, must in
struct his familie, asGen. 18. 19. 
                     Abrahā
                     
did; and labour for circumcision



of heart both to his children
& seruants, euen asGen. 17. 23. 
                     Abraham
did circumcise not onely
those that were borne in his familie,
but also those that were
bought for money. Both Parents
and Maisters are carefull to
preuent diseases, & to breake
off sicknes at the beginning
in their children and seruants,
which by continuance might
bring bodily death, oh then
howe carefull ought they to
bee, to stop betime the course
of naturall Imagination in
them, which without the speciall
grace of God, will bring
eternall condemnation both
to soule and bodie? And the
rather must this course be taken
in youth, and that betime,
because custome, whether
in good or euill, is a second
nature: forPso: 22. 6. 
                     teach a child



in the trade of his way, and when
he is old he will not depart from
it: But,Ier. 13. 23. 
                     can the blacke-Moore
change his skinne, or the leopard
her spots? then may he also doe
good that is accustomed to doe euill:
herein the vices of the
minde, are like the diseases
of the body; by longer continuance
they grow more incurable.
Yea, all that studie and
read the Scriptures, either
for their owne priuate, or
for the publike good, must
seeke by prayer to God for
the sanctification of their
mindes from this euill corruption▪
least beeing left vnto
themselues they become
vaine in their imaginations.

which is euill.
               
               
                  Sect, 4. Of repentance for euill
thoughts
                  The fourth & last vse shall
be for practise to euery child
of God: for if the Imaginations
of mans heart be euill
from his youth, then there
must be repentance for secret
thoughts which neuer come
into action; yea, though we
neuer giue consent of will



thereto. When Ioell proclaimed
a fast, and called the people
to humiliation, hee biddes
themIoel 2. 13. 
                     rent their he arts, & not
their garments: and Peter said
to Simon Magus,
                     Act. 8. 22. 
                     repent of this
thy wickednes, and pray God that
if it be possible, the thought of thy
heart may bee forgiuen thee:
both which places doe plainly
shewe, that true repentance
is not outward in change of
speach or attire, but inward
in the change of the thoughts
of the minde, and affections
of the heart. And hence it is
that Paule prayeth for the
Thessalonians,1. Thes. 5. 23. 
                     that they may
be sanctified throughout, in soule,
in bodie, and spirit, that is, in the
minde, where is the framing
of the thoughts. Nowe if sanctification
bee required in the
minde, then must there be repentance



of the sinnes that
are therein. This dutie the
Lord himselfe vouchsafeth to
teach, and therefore we must
make conscience to learne
and practise it, if we would
be truly turned to the Lord.
And to mooue vs hereunto,
consider the reasons following.
                  First, the curse of God, euen
the pangs and torments
of the damned,1. Reason. both in this
life and after death, are due to
the person of man for his
wicked thoughts: for cursed is
euery one (saithDeut. 27. 6. 
                     Moses) that
continueth not in all things that
are written in the law to doe thē:
so that hee which breaketh
the law but once, and that in
thought only, is accursed, because
he hath not done all
things that are written therein.



Now wicked thoughts are
a breach of the law: for Salomon
saith,Pro. 14. 22. & Pro. 15. 26. 
                     Doe not they erre
that imagine euill? and againe,
The thoughts of the wicked are
an abhomination to the Lord:
yea, the want of good
thoughts is a breach of the
Law: for ChristMark. 12. 30. saith, Thou
shalt loue the Lord thy God
with all thy thought: and therfore
wicked thoughts must
needes deserue this curse. The
fall of the deuills was most
fearefull and irrecouerable,
& (though it be not certen,
yet) most Diuines agree in
this, that their sinne was first
in thought; and therefore
wicked thoughts are deadly
euills. Also to shew the wickednes
of euill thoughts, God
hath set this brand vpon them
since the fall of Adam, that



by them not onely mans body,
but also his minde and
memorie, are far sooner confounded
then by outward accidents;
this was not so by
creation, and therefore it is
the heauie curse of God vpon
them.
                  Secondly, these wicked
thoughts be the roote and
beginning of all 
                        •

                           •
                        ason. word, and deede; there
cannot be an action before
there be a thought: for this is
the order whereby our actions
are produced: first the
minde thinketh; then that
thought delighteth the affection,
Order of producing actions. and from that commeth
consent of will; after
consent of will, commeth execution
of the action, after
executiou commeth trade and
custome by often practise:



and vpon custome (if the
worke be euill) commeth the
curse, which is eternall death.
How great a cause therefore
haue we to repent vs of the
wicked Imaginations of our
hearts? The old world indeede
was drowned for their
actuall abhominations, but no
doubt, the Lord had great
respect in that iudgement to
their wicked thoughts, which
were the roote of all: and
therfore he mentioneth them
as a cause of the flood. Gen.
6. 5.
                  In this repentance,
                     1. examination of euill thoughts. three
things are required; first, a
due examination of our heartr
concerning these imaginations;
which we may take by
the knowledge of those
points before handled, of
mans naturall thoughts concerning



God, his neighbour,
& himselfe: And to further vs
herein we must remember
that all the euill thoughts before
mentioned be in vs naturally,
so as if we be left to
our selues, when occasion is
offered, we will conceiue
them in our mindes; as that
there is no God; that the word of
God is foolishnes, &c. Againe we
must heare Gods word preached
attentiuely, & apply, not
onely our outward senses,
but our mindes also thereto,
that so it may enter into our
hearts; for the word of God,
working in the heart will discouer
vnto a man what be his
thoughts: This word (saith
the holyHeb. 4. 12. Ghost) is mightie
inoperation, and sharper then any
two edged sword, it entreth
through euen to the deuiding a



sunder of the soule and the spirits,
the ioynts and the marrow,
& is a discerner of the thoughts
and intents of the heart: At the
preaching of this word the
secrets of the heart of an infidell
are discouered; if all prophecie
(saith1 Cor. 14. 25. Paul) and there
come in an infidell, or one vnlearned,
he is rebuked of all men,
and iudged of all, and so are the
secrets of his heart made manifest,
whereupon he falleth downe,
and worshippeth God, saying
plainly, God is in the prophets indeede.
                     2. Prayer for pardon of them. Secondly, after examination,
wee must pray
for the pardon of our euill
thoughts; A plaine commandement
of this duty, Peter
giues to Symon MagusAct. 8: 22 
                     pray
to God saith he that the thought
of thine heart may be forgiuen
thee: And vndoubtedly he



that hath not grace to pray
for the pardon of his evill
thoughts, hath not true repentance
in his heart.3 reformation of euill thoughts. Thirdly,
we must seeke to reforme
our minde of euill thoughts;
this is a further matter then
reformation of life: And it is
expressely commanded by the
holy ghost.Ephes. 4. 23. 
                     Be ye renued in the
spirit of your minds, that is, in
the most inward and secret
part of your soules, euen
where the thoughts and imaginations
are framed and cō
                     ceiued:
This duty must be remembred;
for Christian religion
consisteth not in outward
shewes and behauiour,
(though thereby we may giue
comfortable testimony of
Gods inward graces) but it
standes principally in the
mind, and in the heart, which



must therefore be reformed
with the powers and faculties
thereof.
               
            
            
               CHAP. VIII.
               Rules for the reformation of
our euill thoughts.
               
                  Sect. 1. Our thoughts must be
brought into obedience
to God.
                  FOr the reformation of our
thoughts,1. Rule. sundrie rules
must be obserued: first, That
we bring all our thoughts into the
obedience of God. Euery man
will grant that words and
actions, must be in subiection;
but I say further, euery
thought in the mind must be
conceiued in obedience to
God, and no otherwaies: Salomon
Prov. 20. 18. saith, establish thy



thoughts by counsell, which
may admit this meaning, that
a man must not conceiue a
thought in his minde, vnlesse
he haue counsell and warrant
from the word of God so to
thinke: And S. Paul. saith.2. Cor. 10. 5.
                     The weapons of our warrefare
(speaking of the preaching
of the gospell) are not carnall
but mightie through God to
throw downe holds, casting downe
the Imaginations, and every
thing that is exalted against
the knowledge of God, and bringing
into captivitie euery thought
to the obedience of Christ; giuing
vs to vnderstand, that those
who submit themselues to the
ministrie of the word must be
of this mind not onely to be
conformable therevnto in
word and action, but in every
thought of their minde,



euen those must bowe the
knee to Christ: howsoeuer
with men we say thought is
free, yet with God it is not so▪
And indeed he which hath
effectually receiued the grace
of Christ, will endeauour to
yeild obedience as well in
thought, as in word and action:
Whatsoeuer things are true
(saithPhillip. 4. 8. Paul) Whatsoeuer things
are honest, whatsoeuer things
are iust, pure, and pertaine to loue;
whatsoeuer things are of good report,
if there be any vertue, if
there be any praise, (he saith
not onely doe
                     v. 9. 
                     these things,
but) thinke on these things,
where the commandement
is plaine, that a mans thoughts
must be holy, pure, iust, and of
such things as are praiseworthy
and of good report, that so they
may be conceiued in obedience
to God.
               
               
                  
                  Sect. 2. Of the guarding of our
hearts.
                  The second rule for the reformation
of our thoughts,2. Rule. is
giuen by Salomon
                     Pro. 4. 23. 
                     keepe, or
countergard thy heart aboue all
watch and ward, that is guard
and keepe thy heart more thē
any thing that is watched or
guarded, whether citie, house,
treasure or such like; and the
reason adioyned sheweth
the necessities of the rule; for
out of it come the issues of life.
                  
                  In the right guarding of
the heart,3. Things in the guarding of the heart. three duties must be
performed: first we must
couenant with our outward
senses, resoluing fully with
our selues by Gods grace,
that none of them shal be the



instruments, the beginning or
occasion of any sinne in heart,
or life. This couenant
                     Iob. 31. 1. 
                     Iob
made with his eies, not to looke
vpon a maid, to lust after her:
And DavidPsal. 119. 37. prayed the Lord
to direct and keepe his eies from
beholding vanitie: Now looke
how these holy men dealt
with their eyes, so must wee
proportionably deale for all
the outward senses of our body;
bynding them all, after
their example, from being the
meanes of prouocation to
any sinne: This dutie is most
necessarie, for the outward
senses be the doores & windowes
of the soule, and vnlesse
good care be had thereto,
the deuill will enter in by
them and fill the soule with
all corruption.
                  Secondly,2 we must obserue


                     
our euill thoughts, and at
their first arysing, stop and restraine
them, not suffering
them to take any place in our
hearts: this is a speciall
meanes to preserue and guard
the heart; for frō the thoughts
proceede all bad desires, corrupt
affections, euill words &
actions: the minde must first
conceiue before the will can
desire, or the affections bee
delighted, or the members of
the bodie practise any thing,
so that whatsoeuer is of a
loose life, and bad behauiour,
it commeth from the prophanesse
of his heart in evill
thoughts: neither can it bee
hoped that any man should
reforme his life that will not
guard his heart, and keepe his
mind from wicked imaginations:
the deuill cannot worke



his will vpon mans affections,
or preuaile ouer mans will
but by thoughts, & therefore
it is necessarie, that the first
motions of euill in the minde
bee restrayned at the beginning.
                  Thirdly, wee must with all
care cherish and maintaine every
good motion of Gods
spirit that is caused in vs by
the ministerie of the word, or
by the aduise of Gods children:
for these are the sparkes
and flames of grace, which
Paul meaneth when he saith,
1. Thess. 5. 19. 
                     quench not the spirit.
                  
               
               
                  Sect. 3. Of the eleuation of the
heart to God.3. Rule.
                  
                  Thirdly, for the reformation
of our thoughts wee must



often vse eleuation of minde
and heart to heauen, where
Christ sitteth at the right hand
of his father. Thus did Dauid
vnto thee,
                     Psal. 25. 1. 
                     oh Lord, doe I lift
vp my soule: And Paule, saying
of himselfe & other Christians,
Philip. 3. 20 
                     that they had their conversation
in heauen, signifieth
thus much, that not onely
their studies and meditations,
but also their dealings in the
worlde were heauenly. S.
IamesIames. 4▪ 
                        
                           •
                        
                      bids vs, drawe neere to
God, nowe which way should
a poore wretch here below,
drawe neere to God, but by
lifting vp his heart to the
throne of grace in heauen,
that so God in mercie may
drawe neere vnto him by
grace? The Lord hath instituted
in his Church the vse of
his last supper, wherein the



giuing and receiuing of bread
and wine doth represent and
seale vp vnto vs our communion
and participation of the
bodie and blood of Christ
giuen for our redemption:
Now the principall action on
our behalfe therein required,
is this Eleuation of the heart
vnto God, as well for the contemplation
of Gods infinite
mercie in Christ, & of Christs
endlesse loue to vs, as for the
application of his merits to
our owne soules by the hand
of faith, as also for the spirituall
resignation of ourselues
in soules and bodies, by way
of thankfulnes, to him that
hath redeemed vs. Further
touching this Eleuation wee
must remember, that it ought
to be our continuall and ordinarie
action vnto God: for



as it is with him that keepes a
clocke, vnlesse hee doe euery
day winde vp the weights,
which are alwaies going
downeward, the clocke
will stand; so it fareth
with vs; our hearts are euer
drawing towards the earth,
and the thinges heere below,
by reason of that bodie of sinne
                     Heb. 
                           •
                        2. 
                           •
                        . 
                     which hangeth on so fast, and
presseth downe; and therefore
wee must endeauour by Gods
grace continually to lift them
vp to heauen: The Apostle
bids vs,1. Thess. 5. 
                           ••
                        
                      
                     pray continually, not
that wee should doe nothing
else but pray, but his meaning
is, that wee should euery day,
and euery part of the day so
oft as iust occasion is offered,
lift vp our hearts vnto God.
But of all other, there be three
especiall times wherein wee



must vse this heauenly Elevation:
first in the morning,
by prayer, thankesgiuing, or
both, before the cogitations
of any earthly affaires come
into our mindes, that so we
may giue vnto God the first
fruits of our thoughts euery
day. Secondly, in the euening
before wee lay downe
our bodies to rest, for who
knoweth when hee layeth
himselfe downe to sleepe
whether euer hee shall rise againe
aliue? Thirdly, at any
other time of the day, wherein
wee receiue any blessing
from God temporall, or spirituall,
or doe feele our selues
to stand in neede of any of his
gifts, or graces; for seeing euery
good gift comes from
him, is it not reason we should
giue this glorie to his name;



to lift vppe our hearts to his
throne of grace, whensoeuer
wee receiue or expect the
same from his bountifull
hand?
               
               
                  Sect. 5. Of the assurance of our particular
reconciliation
with God.
                  
                     Fourthly,
                     4 Rule. 
                     for the reformation
of our thoughts, we must
labour to be assured in our hearts
by Gods spirite, of our particular
reconciliatiō with God in Christ.
This is that knowledge of the
loue of God which passeth knowledge,
for which Paule,Ephs. 3. 14. 19. bowed
his knees vnto the father of our
Lord Iesus Christ, in the behalfe
of the Ephesians: in regarde
hereof PaulPhillip 
                           •
                        . estemed al things
losse, yea to bee drosse and donge.



Nowe when this assurance is
settled in our hearts, it will
purifie not onely the will and
affections, but also the first
motions and thoughts of our
mindes: Hee that hath in himselfe
this hope (saith,
                     1. Ioh. 3. 3. 
                     S. Iohn
purifieth himselfe as God is pure.
For when a man shall bee
truly perswaded in his heart,
that of a vile sinner, euen the
child of wrath, he is made the
child of God, and a vessell of
honour acceptable to God,
enioying his loue, and fauour
in Christ, then will hee reason
thus with himselfe, hath God
of his endlesse mercie vouchsafed
to receiue mee into his
grace and fauour, that otherwaies
should haue beene a
fyrebrand of hell for euermore:
oh then, howe should I
suffer my minde, my will, and



affections, to bee any longer
the instruments of sin, whereby
I shall displease so gratious
a God, and cast my selfe out
of his loue and fauour: nay,
but I will imploy my soule
which hee hath redeemed
with all the powers and faculties
thereof, as weapons of
righteousnes for the aduancement
of his glorie.

                      if wee would reforme
our thoughts, wee must
giue our selues to spirituall consideration
or meditation. By Spirituall
consideration I meane any
action of the minde renued
and sanctified, whereby it
doth seriously thinke on
those things which may further



saluation. This consideration
I call spirituall, to distinguish
it from earthly plotting
care, whereby naturall
men shew themselues wise &
prouident for the thinges of
this life, though in the matters
of God which concerne
saluation, they bee blinde and
ignorant. Also I adde, it must
be an action of a minde renued
and sanctified, because the
naturall man perceiueth not the
things of the spirit of God,

seeme foolishnes vnto him,
and therefore he cannot giue
his minde vnto them.
                  Nowe the excellent vse of
this rule will plainly appeare
by the fruitfull practise of it
in the Prophet Dauid: for
what was more vsuall with
him then spirituall and heauenly
meditation? sometime



                     vpon
                     Ps. 119. 55. 
                     God himselfe; sometime
Ps▪ 119. 97. 
                     on the workes of God; sometime
Ps. 119. 59. 
                     on his owne waies: and
Ps. 119. 98 
                     continually on Gods word:
now sanctifying this dutie by
praier, as it is plaine hee did
continually, Psal. 19. 14. Let
the meditation of my heart, oh
Lord, bee acceptable in thy sight:
hence it came to passe, that
hee professed an

                           •
                        
                      
                     hatred vnto
vaine inuentions, which are the
proper effects of an vnreformed
minde: and on the contrarie,
by this godly practise

                     got more vnderstanding thē

minde, thatPs. 16. 7. 
                     his raines,
whereby hee meanes the most
secret part of his soule, taught
him in the night season. And
in reason wee may perceiue
the truth heereof: for seeing



contraries doe mutually expell
one another, what can be
more effectuall to purge the
minde of euill thoughts, then
to exercise the same with spirituall
considerations: for
when through the blessing of
God, these shall take place,
the other must needes bee
gone: in regarde whereof it
shall not be amisse somewhat
to insist in the handling of
them.
               
            
            
               CHAP. IX.
               Of spirituall consideration concerning
God.
               
                  Sect. 1. Of the consideration of
Gods presence.
                  
                     SPirituall considerations seruing
for the reformation
of our thoughts, doth either
concerne God, or our selues.
That which concerneth God
containeth many branches,



but I will insist in foure especially.
First, touching Gods presence,
wherby a man doth
thinke and so resolue himselfe,
that wheresoeuer he is,
he stands before God, and
that all his thoughts, wordes,
and deedes are naked in Gods
sight: Dauids heart was filled
with this consideration, when
he penned the 139. psalme:
for that whole psalme from
the beginning to the ende
serueth to expresse this holy
cogitation of Gods presence:
the like impression must wee
labour to haue in our hearts
touching Gods presence: for
it is the most notable meanes,
to cleanse the heart from euill
thoughts, to restraine the will
and affections from wicked
delights, and to keepe in order
the whole man, causing



him to stand in the awe of
Gods commandements. Dauid
saith,Psal. 19. 9. 
                     The feare of the
Lord is cleane; meaning thereby,
that that man which hath
the feare of God in his heart
arising from this consideration
of Gods presence, hath a
cleane and pure heart. This
consideration also is a notable
meanes of comfort in the
time of trouble and danger:
hence DavidPsal. 23. 4. saith, 
                        
                           •
                        hough I
walke through the valley of the
shaddow of death, I will feare
none euill: for the Lord is with
me: and hence it was thatPsal. 3. 6.
                     he would not be afraid for tenne
thousand of the people that should
rise vp against him.
                  
               
               
                  
                  Sect. 2. The consideration of Gods
iudgements.
                  The second consideration
touching God, is of his iudgements,
not onely those which
were done of old, and are recorded
in the Scripture, or other
histories; but euen his
late iudgements which wee
behold, or heare to fall vpon
Kingdomes, Townes, particular
houses, and persons, must
we carefully lay vnto our
hearts. Of the want hereof
the Lord complaineth among
his people saying,Ier 12. 1
                           •
                        
                      
                     The whole
land lieth wast, because no man
setteth his minde on it: giuing
vs to vnderstand, that the
neglect of due consideration
of Gods iudgement brought



desolation to the whole land,
and therefore the want therof
is a maine and grieuous
sinne, bringing further iudgements
with it.
                  God hath sundry times sent
his iudgements among vs;
generally by plague, and famine;
and particularly on
sundrie families, and persons;
but who regardeth them?
Wherefore vnlesse wee will
double Gods iudgements
vpon vs, let vs remember our
dutie, and seriously thinke vpon
them. And that this consideration
may be profitable
vnto vs, we must doe three
things: first, we must carefully
obserue, marke, and remember
them: Psal. 119. 52. I remember
thy Iudgements of old,
O Lord. The Lords people
were much wanting therein,



as Psal. 78. 11. 42. Secondly,
we must apply them to our
owne person in particular,
so as the thought thereof may
make vs afraid, though they
befall others. WhenHab. 3. 16. 
                     Habakuck
in a vision saw the iudgements
of God, which were to
come vpon the Chaldeans, the
consideration thereof was so
powerfull with him, that it
made him tremble and quake
In a familie when the father
beateth his seruant the child
feareth; and when one
child is beaten, then all the
rest crie: euen so when God
our father powreth downe
his iudgements, though vpon
the heathen, yet wee must
feare; but when any of his
children are afflicted, it must
strike soare to our hearts.
Thirdly, we must make vse of



Gods iudgments that light
vpon others, by applying
them to our selues. When
certaine men brought newes
to our Sauiour Christ of an
heauie iudgement vpon some
Luk. 13, 1, 2, 3. 
                     Galileans, whose blood Pilate
had mingled with their owne sacrifices,
immediately our Saviour
labours to bring them
that told him to make vse
thereof for their owne good,
saying, that thereby they
ought to be mooued to repentance:
for they that were
slaine, were no greater sinners
then the rest: and therefore
except they who told that
newes did amend their liues,
they should also perish. So that
whensoeuer we see or heare
of any iudgement of God
vpon others, wee must thereby
be mooued to repent: and



thus doing, we shall come to
a right consideration of gods
Iudgements.
               
               
                  Sect. 3. The consideration of Gods
word.
                  The third consideration
concerning God, is of his
word. Dauid maketh it the
propertie of a blessed man,Ps. 1. 2. to
meditate in the law of God day
and night: and he professeth
of himselfe, thatPs. 119 97. 
                     it was his meditation
continually: yea oftentimes
he promiseth tov. 15. 
                     meditate
in Gods precepts, to
                     v. 16. 
                     delight
in Gods statutes. This isLuk. 2. 51. 
                     Maries
praise, that shee kept in her
heart sundrie things which Iesus
spake. And so ought euery
child of God, high or low,
daily and continually to meditate



in the word of God.
But, alas, this dutie is little
knowne and lesse practised:
men are so farre from meditating
in Gods word, that
they are ignorant of it. Among
many families you
shall scarse finde the booke
of God: and such as haue it,
for the most part, doe little
vse it. The statutes of the land
are by very many searched
out diligently, but in the
meane time the statutes of
the Lord are litle regarded:
oh that men knew the sweete
comfort
                     Rom. 15. 4. 
                     of the Scriptures, then
certenly they would account
their meditation thereinIer. 15. 16.
                     the ioy and reioycing of their
heart.
                  
                  Now the right consideration
of Gods word consists in
three things: first, we must



obserue the true sense, and
meaning of that which wee
heare, or read; secondly, we
must marke what experience
we haue had of the truth of
the word in our owne persons;
as in the exercises of
Repentance, & Inuocation of
Gods name, and in all our
Temptations: this is a speciall
point in this meditation, without
which the former is nothing.
Thirdly, we must consider
how farre forth we haue
beene answerable to Gods
word in obedience, and wherin
we haue beene defectiue
by transgressions. Againe in
the word of God, there bee
both commandements, and
promisses: The consideration
of Gods commandements is
a notable meanes to direct, &
moderate, not onely our



words, and deedes, but also
our secret thoughts and desires:
for if before we thinke,
before we will, or speake any
thing, we would first consider
that god cōmands vs to think,
to will, and speake thus and
thus; this would mightily
stay, and suppresse in vs all
corrupt Thoughts and desires,
all euill words, and actions:
The promisses of God
likewise duly cōsidered would
greatly further vs in good
Thoughts: for to them that
think on good things, shall be
mercie and Truth. Prov. 14.
22. The cause then why many
that know the will of God, so
much faile in particular obedience
is because that with
their knowledge, they doe not
ioyne this serious consideration
of Gods commandements,



and promisses, and
apply the same to their occasions.
               
               
                  Sect 4. The consideration of Gods
workes.
                  The fourth consideration
cōcerning God, is of his workes:
for as Dauid saith,Psal. 11. 2. 
                     The
workes of the Lord are great, and
ought to be sought out of all that
loue him. This consideration
bindeth vs to enquire, and
search what be the workes
of God toward vs; his worke
of creation, his providence,
preseruation, with all other
his workes of mercie and
Iustice in vs, and vpon vs:
whether ordinary: or extraordinary:
The prophetEsay. 5. 11, 12. Isay
denounceth a woe against
those that had the harpe, and



vyoll, Timbrell and Pype, and
wine in their feasts, and regarded
not the worke of God, nor considered
the worke of his hands;
whereby we may see that the
neglect hereof, is a grieuous
sinne, and yet it is the commō
sinne of this age.
                  Now for the better performance
of this dutie, wee
must thus proceede; first we
must consider our creation,
how the Lord gaue vs being,
when we were nothing; and
how he made vs reasonable
creatures, & not brute beasts,
yea, he created vs in his owne
image, when as he might if
it had so pleased him, haue
made vs Toades, & Serpents:
Secondly, we must consider
his good providence ouer vs,
howe he hath preserved our
life from time, to time, and



saued vs from many dangers:
And his great patience must
not be forgotten, how he hath
spared vs from the righteous
Iudgements of our sinnes; hee
might haue cast vs into hell,
in our mothers wombe, or so
soone as wee were borne for
our originall sinne: But hee
hath giuen vs a large time of
Repentance. Heere also wee
must consider his exceeding
fauour in the time and place
of our birth, and life: hee
might haue suffered vs to
haue beene borne among Infidels:
but behold wee were
borne in the bosome of Gods
Church: hee might haue depriued
vs of the meanes of
our saluation, his holie worde
and Sacraments; but in his
tender mercie hee hath
vouchsafed them vnto vs, to



bring our soules to life. Hee
might haue,Isay. 63. 17. 
                     hardned our
hearts against his feare, and
blinded our eies against his
light,
                     Rom. 11. 8. but yet he hath enlightned
our mindes to knowe his
truth, and softned our hearts
causing vs to crie vnto him
for the pardon of our sinne;
he might haueRom. 1. 28. 
                     giuen vs vp to
a reprobate sense, when wee
swerued from his testimonies,
and reguarded not the
knowledge of his will: but
loe, as a louing father he hath
oftenHeb. 12. 10. 
                     chastened vs. for our profit,
that wee might bee partakers
of his holines: Hee might haue
left vs comfortles vnder the
reproch of the wicked, but hee
hath vouchsafed vs his spirit,
for our euerlasting comforter.
Thus must we dulie consider
of all these wonderfull



workes of God towardes vs,
and not like the men of this
world, thinke on nothing but
pastimes, honours, and commodities;
This will bee a notable
meanes to keepe our
hearts from euill thoughtes:
for whose heart will not relent
towards his God, that so
many waies hath tasted of his
bountie towardes him? yea,
this consideration will bee an
exceeding stay and comfort
to our soules in the daie of
trouble, and distresse: so Salomon
saith:Ecles. 5. 15. 16. 
                     Beholde the
worke of God, and in the day of
affliction consider: A naturall
man cannot away with trouble,
if sorrowes encrease vpon
him, hee is readie to make
away himselfe, which comes
of this that he can not consider
the workes of God, for he



that can rightly meditate on
Gods goodnesse towards
him in all his workes, shall be
able with patience to support
his soule vnder the greatest
crosse. A practise heereof we
may see in Dauid who being
in a most greeuous temptation,
so as he cried out,Psal. 77. 8. 
                     Is the
Lords mercie cleane gone? hath
he forgotten to be mercifull, &c.
Did yet recouer himselfe by
the consideration of Gods former
workes of mercie, and of his
                     v. 11. 12. 
                     wonders of old, whereof he had
experience in his owne person.
                  
               
            
            
               CHAP. X.
               Of spirituall considerations
which concerne our
selues.
               
                  
                  Sect. 5. The consideration of our
owne personall
sinnes.
                  THe considerations which
respect our selues are six:
First, we must cōsider our owne
personall sinnes; as well the corruptions
of our hearts, as the
actuall Transgressions of
our liues. This was Dauids
practise;Psal. 115. 59. 
                     I considered my waies
saith hee) and turned my feete,
into thy testimonies. The Iewes
likewise in their great affliction,
stirred vp themselues to
this dutie, saying one to another;
Lam. 3. 40. 
                     come let vs search, and
trie our waies, and turne againe
vnto the Lord.
                  
                  In this consideration of our
sinnes, wee must doe three
things: First, seriouslly call to



minde in what manner wee
haue sinned; whether of ignorance
or of knowledge, of
weaknesse through infirmitie
or of wilfulnesse through presumption:
Secondly, we must
dulie waighe the greatnes of
our particular sinnes, euen of
the least of them, remembring
this, that by euery sinne
wee commit, Gods infinite
maiestie is displeased, and his
iustice violated: Thirdly, wee
must consider the number of
our sinnes; which wee shall
neerest attaine vnto, by searching
out our Thoughts, our
wills, & affections, our words,
& actions, all which being diligently
obserued, will make
vs crie out, that they bee in
number as the haires of our
head, and the sands by the
Sea-shoare. Quest. But what if



a man haue truely repented
him of his sinnes, must he still
vse this cōsideration of them?
Answ. Yes verily, although he
bee assured of the pardon of
them: so did Dauid after Nathan
tould him thy sinnes are
forgiuen; hee penned the 51.
Psalme, and when hee was
high in Gods fauour, he prayed
still for thePsal. 25. 7. 
                     pardon of the
sinnes of his youth: for howsoeuer
God in mercie put our
sinnes out of his remembrāce
vpon our true repentance, yet
we must neuer put them out
of our remembrance, so long
as we liue in this world; because
the consideration of
them, though they bee pardoned,
is a notable meanes both
to mooue vs to renewe our repentance,
and also to make
vs watchfull against sinne in



time to come.
               
               
                  Sect. 2. Of mans miserie through
his sinnes.
                  Secondly, wee must consider
the miserie into which euery
one is plunged by nature through
Adams fall, and his owne sinnes.
This was Iobs meditation, saying,
Iob. 14. 1. 
                     Man that is borne of a
woman, hath but a short time to
liue, he is full of miserie: and so
goeth on most notably describing
the miserie of man:
yea, this was Salomons consideration
in the whole book
of Ecclesiastes, from the beginning
to the end.
                  Nowe that this consideration
may take place in our
hearts,Mans natural miserie branthed out. wee must enter into a
particular view of this our naturall
miserie: the principall
branches whereof bee these:



first, a separation from all fellowship 
with God: for as Isai
                     Isa. 59. 2. saith,
Our sinnes haue separated betweene
God and vs: and this is
the speciall part of mans miserie.
Secondly, societie and 
fellowship with the damned spirits,
the deuill and all his angels;
standing in this, that man by
nature beareth the image of
the deuill, and withall performeth
seruice vnto him in the
practise of lying, iniustice,
crueltie, and all manner of
sinne. Thirdly, all manner of 
calamities in this life, as ignominie
in good name, paines
and diseases in the bodie, losses,
and damages in friends,
and in all temporall blessings
whatsoeuer. Fourthly, the horrour
of a guiltie conscience,
which is in it selfe the beginning



of hell torments: for it
is our accuser vnto God, our
Iudge to giue sentence against
vs, and the very hang-man of
our soules to condemne vs eternally.
Fiftly, the second
death, which is the full apprehension
of the eternall furie
 of Gods wrath, both in bodie
and soule eternally. This consideration
must be often vsed
of euery man, to mooue him
to repentance, and it is very
effectuall thereunto: for if we
doe but consider howe a man
for the paine of one tooth,
will be so grieued, that hee
could wish with all his heart
to be out of the worlde, that
his paine were ended; oh
then how great shal we think
the apprehension of the full
wrath of God to bee, seazing
not vpon one little member,



but vpon the whole man
both bodie and soule, & that
for euer? No tongue can expresse,
nay no heart can conceiue
the greatnes of this terrour,
and therefore it must be
an occasion both to beginne
and encrease true repentance
in vs dailie.
               
               
                  Sect. 3. Of our owne particular
temptations.
                  Thirdly, wee must consider
our owne particular Temptations
wherewith wee are most assaulted
through the malice
of Sathan, and our owne corruption.
Bee sober and watch
(saith1. Pet. 5. 8. Peter) for your aduersarie
the deuill goeth about like a
roaring Lyon, seeking whome he
may deuoure. This was Paules
practise towards the incestuous
man, whom hee had enioyned
to bee excommunicate,



for after he heard of his
repentance, hee gaue direction
that hee should bee receiued
into the Church againe, least
hee were swallowed vp of ouer
much heauines, and so Sathan
should circumvent them: for
(saith2. Cor. 2. 
                           •
                         & 11. hee) wee are not ignorant
of his enterprises. If forraigne
enemies should seeke
the inuasion of our land, not
onely our magistrates, but euerie
ordinarie man well affected
to his Countrey, would
bethinke himselfe what coast
were the weakest, that thether
present defence might bee
sent to keep out the enemies;
euen so, seeing the deuill doth
assault vs daily, wee must enter
into serious consideration
of our thoughts, wills; and affections,
and see in what part
we bee most weake, and in



what inclination Satan may
most easily preuaile against
vs, which we shall best espie
by obseruing the sinnes of our
liues; and this will make vs
arme our selues against him by
Gods grace, euen in the weakest
parts, that hee breake not
into our hearts, to the ruine of
our soules.
                  This consideration concerneth
all men, not onely the
dissolute and sinnefull, but euen
those that haue receiued
most grace. It were infinite to
goe through all the temptations
of Satan▪ consider this
one for all,An ordinarie and yet most dangerous temptation. whereby he kills
many a soule; Through the
whole course of mens liues,
he laboureth to fill their
hearts with carnall securitie,
and to bring them to neglect



the ordinary meanes of saluation;
this done, he seekes to
keepe them in this estate
all their life long: but in the
end he takes an other course,
for when death approcheth,
then he seekes to strike their
mindes with obliuion of gods
mercies, and to fill their soules
with terrours in regard of
their sinnes, and of Gods
iudgements due vnto them;
that so bereauing them of all
hope of mercie, he may bring
them to finall despaire: Wee
therefore beeing forewarned
of his deadly fraud, must seriously
bethinke our selues of
this temptation, and cast with
our selues euery day how to
auoide it. This we shall doe if
we shake off carnall securitie,
and negligence in the meanes
of our saluation: and prouide



betimes for the assurance of
Gods loue and fauour, that
when death shall come, wee
may be free from the terrour
of an euill conscience, & haue
strong hope, and consolation
in Christ Iesus.
               
               
                  Sect. 4. Of our particular ende.
                  Fourthly, we must consider
our particular ende. The Lord
complaineth of the want
hereof in his owne people,
Deut. 32. 29. 
                     Oh that they were wise, then
would they consider this; They
would consider their latter end.
In this consideration three
points must be obserued:
first, that the time of death is
vncertaine, no man knoweth
when he must dye: secondly,
that the place is vncertaine,
no man knoweth where he
must dye: thirdly, that the



                     manner of his death is vncertaine,
none knoweth by what
death he shall glorifie God
and therefore that we may
not deceiue our selues, wee
must thinke that most fearefull,
and greivous ends may
befall vs, in regard of the bodily
payne, and torment,
euē then when we little feare
or suspect any such thing.
This consideration will bee a
notable meanes, to stirre vp
our hearts either to beginne,
or renew our repentance:
when wicked1. King. 21. 27. 
                     Ahab heard
of his fearefull end, hee was
humbled: And the Ninivites
beeing told of their sudden
destructiō,Ionah. 3. 56. repented in Sackcloath,
and Ashes, and turned to
the Lord.
                  
               
               
                  
                  Sect. 5. Of our straight accompt at
the last day.
                  Fiftly, we must often consider
with our selues, and that
most seriously, of that straight
account, and reckoning of all
our thoughts, words, and actions,
which we must make vnto God
at the last day of iudgement. This
is the principall consideration
of all, and the want hereof a
fearfull sinne, arguing great
negligence, ignorance, blyndnes
of mind, and hardnes of
heart: If a Traveller come into
an Inne, hauing but one penny
in his purse and call for
all manner of dainty fare,
and prouision, spending sumptuously,
will not al men iudge



him void of all consideration,
sith he hath nothing to pay,
when his account is to bee
made? loe, this, or worser is
the most mens case, who in
this life pursue their profits
and pleasures, with all eagernes,
they care not how, neuer
regarding that reckonning
which they must make vnto
God, at his terrible day of accounts
with all the world:
and therefore though the
former cōsiderations will not,
yet let this take place in our
hearts, to mooue vs to a daily
forehand reckonning with
God in the practise of true
repentance, and to imploy the
good gifts and blessings we
receiue from God, like good
seruants, vnto the best advantage
of his glorie, that when
this account is to be made,



we may giue it with ioy,
and not with feare. And
that this consideration is effectuall
to this purpose, Salomon
teacheth in vsing it as
his farewell with dissolute
youth, with whome otherwaies
he hath little hope
to preuaile, sayingEcclesiast. 11. 9. 
                     goe too
thou young man, take thy pleasure
in thy youth, yet know, that
for all this, thou must come to
Iudgement. But how powerfull
it is with Gods child, we may
see in Paul,
                     Act. 24. 15. who professeth
of himselfe that in regard of
this account, he endeauoured to
haue alway a cleere conscience
towards God, and towards men.
                  
               
               
                  
                  Sect. 6. Of our present estate towards
God.
                  Lastly, we must seriously
consider of our present estate
towards God, whether we be in
the state of sinne, or in the
state of grace; whether we
belong to the kingdome of
darkenes, or be true members
of the kingdome of Christ: It
is not enough to bee in the
Church, but we must be sure,
we be of the Church; For many
wolues, and Goates be in
Gods fould; They went out from
vs (saith S.
                     1. Iohn. 1. 19. Iohn) but they were
not of vs: And therefore Paul
adviseth to this consideration,
saying,2. Cor. 13. 5. 
                     prooue your selues,
whether you bee in the faith or
not. The want hereof was the
fearefull sinne of the foolish


                     
                     virgins,
                     Mat. 25. 3. who contented themselues
with a shew of religion,
hauing the blasing lampes
of outward profession; and laboured
not for that oyle of true
grace, which might enlighten
their soules to the fruition of
Gods glorie: yea, this is
the common sinne of this age,
men blesse themselues in
their good meaning, saying
they hope well; and doe not
through search, whether
they be true members of gods
Church or not: Now if after
tryall it appeare, that true
faith and repentance be wanting
in vs, which are the
seales of Adoption in Gods
children then with all good
conscience, we must vse the
meanes appointed of God to
obteine these graces for our
assurance; the comfort whereof



will be so pretious vnto
our soules, that we shall abhor
to admit such wicked Imaginations
into our minds,
as any way tend to depriue
vs of it.
                  These are the considerations
which respect our selues;
whereunto if we giue our
mindes in a constant course,
as also to the former which
concerne the Lord, obseruing
withall the rules before prescribed,
through Gods blessing
vpon our endeauour, wee
shall vndoubtedly finde by
good experience, that euill
thoughts shall not preuaile against
vs: but beeing reformed
in our cogitations, we shall
send out of our mindes as
from a cleansed fountaine,
such streames of good words
and works, through the whole



course of our liues, as shall redound
to the glorie of our
God, the good of our brethren,
and the consolation of
our owne soules, through Iesus
Christ our Lord, to whome
with the Father, and the holy
Ghost, be praise in his church
for euermore. Amen.
                  
                  FINIS.
