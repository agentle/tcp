               And what is the best newes there William?
            
            
               VVill.
               Good newes for you my Lord Cardinall, for
one of the old wemen Waterbearers told me for certain,
that last Friday all the belles in Rome Rang backward,
there was a thowsand Derges sung, sixe hundred auemaries
said, euerie man washt his face in holy water, the
peopel crossing and blessing themselues to send them a
new Pope, for the old is gon to purgatory.
            
            
               VVolsie:
               Ha, ha, ha,
            
            
               Will.
               Nay, my Lord you'd laugh, if't were so indeed, for
euery bodie thinks if the Pope were dead; you gape for
a benefice, but this newes my Lord is cald too good to
be true.
            
            
               King.
               But this newes came a pace Will, that came
from Rome to London since Friday last,
            
            
               Will.
               For, twas at Billings-gate by Satterday Morning,
twas a full Moone, and it came vp in a spring tide.
            
            
               Kin.
               Then you here of the Embassadors that are come.
            
            
               Wills.
               I, I, & that was the cause of my ryding to know
what they came for, I was told it all at a Barbars.
            
            
               King.
               Ha, ha, what a fooles this, Iane, and what
doe they say he comes for, Will:
            
            
               William:
               Marry they say he comes to craue thy aide against the
great Turk that vowes to ouerrunne all France within this fortnight,
he's in a terrible rage belik, & they say, the reason is, his old god Mamet
that was buried ith top on's Church at Meca, his Tombe fell
downe, and kilde a Sowe and seuen Pigges, whereupon they thinke
all swines flesh is new sanctified, and now it is thought the Iewes wil
fall to eating of porke extreamely after it.
            
            
               king.
               This is strang indeede, but is this all.
            
            
               Will.
               No there is other newes that was told me, among the wemen
at a backe house, and that is this, they say, the great Bell in glassenberie.
Tor has told twise, and that king Arthur, and his Knights
of the round Table that were buried in Armour, are aliue again, crying
Saint Gorge for England, and meane shortly to conquere Rome,

marrie this is thought to be but a morrall,
            
            
               king.
               The Embassadors are comming, and heare William see that

               Countesse.
               I beseech your grace resolue immediatly,
            
            
               King.
               Immediatly (saist thou) O, tis no quicke resolue
               Can giue good verdit in so sad a choise:
               To loose my Queene, that is my some of blisse,
               More vertuous than a thowsand Kingdomes be;
               And should I lose my Sonne (if Sonne it be)
               That all my subiects to desire to see.
               I loose the hope of this great Monarchy.
               What shall I doe?
            
            
               Lady Marie.
               Remember the Queene my Lord:
            
            
               King.
               I not forget her (Sister) O poore soule,
               But I forget thy paine and miserie,
               
                  Goe, let the Childe die; let the Mother liue,
               Heauens powerfull hand may more children giue:
               Away, and comfort her with our reply,
               
                  Harry will haue his Queene though thowsands die.
               I know no issue of her princely wombe:
               Why then should I preferre't before her life.
               Exit. La.
               Whose death ends all my hopefull loyes on earth.
               God's will be done, for suer it is his will,
               For secret reasons to himselfe best knowne:
               Perhaps he did mould forth a Sonne for me,
               And seeing (that sees all) in his creation,
               To be some impotent and coward spirit,
               Vnlike the figure of his Royall Father:
               Has thus decrede, least he should blurre out fame,
               As Whylome did the sixt king of my name
               Loose all his Father (the first Henrie) wonne.
               Ile thanke the Heauens for taking such a Sonne.
               Whose within there?
            
            Enter Compton.
            
              My Lord.
            
            
               king.
               Goe Compton, bid Lord Seimer come to me,
               The honor'd Father of my wofull Queene
               Now now what newes?
            
            
               
               L. Marie.
               We did deliuer what your highnesse wild,
               Which was no sooner by her grace receiud:
               But with the sad report, she seemd as dead,
               Which causd vs stay, after reuouerie.
               She sent vs backe tintreate your Maiestie,
               As euer you did take delight in her,
               As you preferre the quiet of her soule,
               That now is readie to forsake this life,
               As you desire to haue the life of one,
               She doth intreate your grace that she may dye,
               Least both doth perish in this agonie:
               For to behold the infant suffer death,
               Were endlesse tortures, made to stop her breath,
               Then to my Lord (quoth she) thus gently say,
               The child is faire, the mother earth and clay,
            
            
               King.
               Sad messenger of woe; oh my poore Queene,
               Canst thou so soone consent to leaue this life,
               So pretious to our soule, so deere to all,
               To yeeld the hopefull yssue of thy loines,
               To raise our second comfort, well, be it so:
               Ill, be it so: stay, I reuoke my word,
               But that you say helpes not, for she must dye:
               Yet if ye can saue both, ile giue my crowne:
               Nay, all I haue, and enter bonds for more,
               Which with my conquering sword with fury bent,
               Ile purchase in the farthest continent,
               Vse all your chiefest skill, make hast away,
               Whilst we for your successe deuoutly pray.
            
            Enter Lord Seymer.
            
               Seym.
               All ioy and happinesse betide my Soueraigne.
            
            
               King.
               Ioy be it good Lord Seymer noble father,
               Or ioy, or griefe, thou hast a part in it,
               Thou comit to greete vs in a doubtfull houre,
               Thy daughter and my Queene lies now in paine,
               And if I loose, Seymer thou canst not gaine.
            
            
               Sey.
               Yet comfort, good my Liege, this womans woe,
               Why? tis as certaine to her as her death,
               Both giuen her in her first creation:
               It is a sower to sweete, giuen them at first,
               By their first mother, then put sorrow hence:
               Your grace, erc long shall see a gallant Prince,
            
            
               
               King.
               Be thou a Prophet Seymer in thy words,
               Thy loue some comfort to our hopes affoords,
               How now.
            
            Enter two Ladies.
            
               Count.
               My gratious Lord, here I present to you,
               A goodly sonne: see here your flesh, your bone,
               Looke here royall Lord, I warrant tis your owne.
            
            
               Seym.
               See here my Liege, by the rood a gallant Prince,
               Ha little cakebread, foregod a chopping boy.
            
            
               King.
               Euen now I wept with sorow, now with ioy,
               Take that for thy good newes, how fares my Queene.
            
            Enter Mary and one Lady.
            
               Count.
               O my good Lord, the wofull.
            
            
               King.
               Tell no more of woe, speake, doth she liue?
               What? weepe ye all, nay, then my heart misgiues,
               Resolue me sister, is the newes worth hearing.
            
            
               L. Mary.
               Nor worth the telling, royall Soueraigne.
            
            
               King.
               Now, by my crowne, thou dimst my royaltie,
               And with thy cloudie lookes eclipst my ioyes,
               Thy silent eye bewrayes a ruthfull sound,
               Stopt in the organs of thy troubled spirit:
               Say, is she dead.
            
            
               La. Mary.
               Without offence she is.
            
            
               Kin.
               Without offence, saist thou, heauen take my soule,
               What can be more offensiue to my life:
               Then sad remembrance of my faire Queenes death,
               Thou wofull man, that camst to comfort me:
               How shall I ease thy hearts calamitie?
               That cannot helpe thy selfe, how one sad minute
               Hath raisd a fount of sorrowes in his eyes,
               And bleard his aged cheekes, yet Seymer see,
               She hath left part of her selfe, a sonne to me:
               To thee a graund-child, vnto the land a Prince,
               The perfect substance of his royall mother,
               In whom her memory shall euer liue:
               
                  Phoenix Iana obit nato Phoenice,
               
               
                  Dolendum secula phoenices nulla tulisse duas.
               
               One Phenix dying, giues another life,
               Thus must we flatter our extreamest griefe.
               What day is this.
            
            
               Cump.

               Kin.

            Enter the Cardinall, Embassadors,
Bonner and Gardner.
            
               Wool.
               My Lords of Fraunce you haue had small cheere with vs,
               But you must pardon vs, the times are sad,
               And focits not now for mirth and banqueting:
               Therefore I pray make your swift returne,
               Commend me to your king, and kindly tell him,
               The English Cardinall will remaine his friend,
               The Lady Mary shall be forthwith sent,
               And ouertake ye ere you reach to Douer:
               And for the businesse that concearnes the league,
               Vrge it no more, but leaue it to my care,
            
            
               Bone.
               We thanke your grace, my good Lord Cardinal,
               And so with thankfulnesse we take our leaues.
            
            
               Wool.
               Happily speed my honorable Lords,
               My heart, I sweare, still keepes you company,
               Farewell to both, pray your king remember,
               My sute betwixt him and the Emperour,
               We shall be thankfull, if they thinke on vs.
            
            
               Par.
               We will be earnest in your cause my Lord,
               So of your grace we once more take our leaues.
            
            
               Wool.
               Againe farewell, Bonner conduct them forth,
               Now Gardner, what thinkst thou of these times.
            
            
               Gard.
               Well, that the leagues confirmd, my gratious Lord,
               Ill, that I feare the death of good Queene Iane,
               Will caute new troubles in our state againe.
            
            
               VVool.
               Why thinkst thou so?
            
            
               Gard.
               I feare false Luther; doctrins spread so farre,
               I cast that his highnesse now vnmaried,
               Should match amongst that sect of Lutherans,
               
               You saw how soone his maiestie was wonne,
               To scorne the Pope, and Romes religion,
               When Queene Anne Bullen wore the diadem.
            
            
               Wool.
               
                  Gardner tis true, so was the rumor spread:
               But Woolsie wrought such meanes she lost her head,
               Tush feare not thou whilst Haries life doth stand,
               He shall be king, but we will rule the land.
               
                  Bonner come hither, you are our trustie friend:
               See that the treasure we have gathered,
               
               The Copes, the Vestments, and the Challices,
               The smoake pence, and the tributary fees,
               That English chimnies pay the Church of Rome:
               Be barreld close within the inner seller,
               Wele send it ouer shortly to prepare,
               Our swift aduancement to Saint Peters chaire,
               Be trustie, and be sure of honors speedily,
               The king hath promised at the next election,
               
                  Bonner shall haue the Bishopricke of London.
            
            
               Bon.
               
                  I humbly thanke your grace.
            
            
               Wool.
               And Gardner shall be Lord of Winchester:
               Had we our hopes, what shall you not be then,
               When we haue got the Papall diadem.
            
            Exeunt.
            Enter Brandon, Dudley, Gray, Seymer, Compton.
            
               Br.
               How now Sir William Cumpton, where is the king.
            
            
               Cum.
               His grace is walking in the gallery,
               As sad and passionate as ere he was.
            
            
               Dud.
               Twere good your grace went in to comfort him.
            
            
               Bran.
               Not I Lord Dudley, by my George I sweare,
               Vnlesse his Highnesse first had sent for me,
               I will not put my head in such a hazzard,
               I know his anger, and his spleene too well.
            
            
               Gray.
               Tis strange, this humor hath his highnesse held,
               Euer since the death of good Queene Iane,
               That none dares venture to conferre with him.
            
            Enter Cardinall, Sommers, and Patch.
            
               Dud.
               Here comes the Cardinall.

               Sem.
               Lets win this prelate to salute the king,
               It may perhaps work his disgrace with him,
            
            
               Wool.
               How now William, what? are you here to,

               Yes cosin, hey, da, tere, dedell, dey, day.

               We thanke your honour.
            
            Enter king within. Call wiithin.
            
               Kyng.
               
                  What Cumpton, Carew.
            
            
               
               Brand.

               King.
               Mother of God, how are we attended on: who

               Brand.
               Go in Sir William, and if you find his grace

               His grace hath taken such an inward greefe,
               With sad remembrance of the Queene that's dead:
               That much his highnesse wrongs his state and person,
               Besides in Ireland, do the Burkes rebell,
               And stout Pearsie that disclod the plot,
               Was by the Earle of Kildare late put to death.
               And Martin Luther out of Germanie.
               Has writ a booke against his Maiestie,
               For taking part with proud Pope Iulius,
               
               Which being spred by him through Christendome,
               Hath thus incenst his royall maiestie.
            
            
               Wool.
               Tush, I haue newes, my Lord, to salue that sore,
               And make the king more feard through christendome,
               Then euer was his famous auncestors:
               Nor can base Luther with his heresies,
               Backt by the proudest germaine potentate,
               Heretically blurre king Henries fame:
               For honour that he did Pope Iulius,
               
               Who in high fauour of his Maiestie,
               Hath sent Campeus with a bull from Rome,
               To adde vnto his title this high stile:
               That he and his faire posteritie,
               Proclaimd defenders of the faith shall be:
               For which intent the holy Cardinals come,
               As Legats from the Emperiall court of Rome.
            
            
               Gr.
               This newes, my Lord, may somthing ease his mind,
               Twere good your grace would go and visit him.

he was at our last parting, hele make him repent his saucinesse.

               Mony playes fast and loose, purchaces fauour,
               And without that, nought but miserie.
               A poore Gentleman hath made complaint to mee,,
               I am vndone (quoth he) and kept in prison,

               I am a weake Scholler my Lord,
               But on conditiō that your Highnesse, not these reuerent Lords,
               Will take no exceptions at my womans wit,
               I am content to holde them Argument:
               And first with reuerence to his Maiestie.
               Pray tell me, why would ye make the King beleeue.
               His Highnesse and the people vnder him,

               Queen.
               So are all Kings; and God himselfe commaunds
               The King to rule, and people to obay.
               And both to loue and honour him:
               But you that are sworne seruants vnto Rome,

               Madame these are that sectes of Lutherans,
               That makes your Highnesse so mistake the Scriptures,
               Your slender arguments thus aunswered

               Tis true, but pray ye answere this:
               Suppose, the King by Proclamation,
               Commaunded you and

               Yee know the Scripture binds yee to obey him,
               But this I thinke, if that his Grace did so,
               Your slight obedience all the world should know.

               By bare-foote pilgrimage to visite shrines,
