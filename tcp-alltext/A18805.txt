                  Anno dn̄i. 1550.
               
            
         
         
            
            
            To the righte vertuouse, and my singuler good Lady, Katharine duchesse of Suffolke.
            
               AS my prisonment and aduersitee, most honorable lady, was of their owne nature ioigned with great and sundrie miseries, so was the sufferance of the same eased, by the chaunce of diuerse and many commoditees. For thereby founde I great soule profite, a little minde knowlage, some holow hertes, and a few feithfull freendes. Wherby I tried prisonment of the body, to be

the libertee of spirite: aduersitee of fortune: the touche stone of freendship, exempcion from the world, to be a contempt of vanitees: and in the ende quietnes of mind, the occasion of study. And thus somewhat altered, to auoide my olde idelnesse, to recompense my lost time, and to take profite of my calamitee, I gaue my selfe among other thynges to study and learne the Frenche tonge, hauyng both skilful prisoners to enstruct me, and therto plenty of bookes to learne the language. Among whiche as there were dyuerse notable, and for their sondry mattier woorthy readyng, so none liked me aboue this Tullius booke of

freendship, nor for the argument any with it to be compared. The whole wherof whan I had perused, and saw the goodly rules, the naturall order, and ciuile vse of freendship, where before I but liked, than was I rauished, and in a certaine wonder with the heathen lernyng, which chiefly for it selfe I phantasied, and for my state I deemed good to be embraced, as a glasse to discerne my freendes in, and a ciuile rule to leade my life by. These causes moued me to thinke it mete for moe. Wherapon I (as I coulde) translated it, and though not so liuely, nor yet so aptly, as some wold loke for, and many culd

doe, yet I trust thei will rather beare with my good will, then rebuke my boldnes, for that it proceded more of a good mind than of any presumpcion of knowlage: and so my enterprise is to be enterpreted rather by freendes, as a treatise of frendship, then by lerned clerkꝭ in an argumēt of translacion. Well, how so euer it shalbe liked of the learned, I hope it shalbe allowed of the vnlatined. Whose capacitees by my owne I cōsider, and for lacke of a fine and flowyng stile, I haue vsed the plaine and common speache. and to thende the sence might not be chaunged, nor the goodnes of the matter by shift of tounges, muche minished,

I caused it to be conferred with the latine auctor, and so by the knowen wel lerned to be corrected: after whose handelyng me thought a new spirite and life was geuen it, and many partes semed as it were with a new cote araied, aswell for the orderly placyng and eloquently changeyng of some woordes, as also for the plainly openyng and learnedly amending of the sence, whiche in the Freenche translacion was somewhat darkened, and by me for lacke of knowlage in many places missed.
            ¶Thus whan the thing was perfected, and I behelde the fame of the auctor, the nature of the treatise, and the clerenesse

of his teachyng, I coulde not iudge to whom I shoulde rather offre it, than vnto your grace, whom the freendelesse dayly find their defence, and the helples repaire to as a refuge. This did I not to teache you, but to let you see in learnyng auncient, that you haue by nature vsed: nor to warne you of ought you lacked, but to sette forth your perfection: the proufe wherof the deade might witnesse, and their ofspring hath iust cause to knowlage it, as mo can record it, then can requite it. And suche your freendly stedfastnesse declared to the deade, doth assertaine vs of your stedfast frendlinesse toward the liuyng, whiche

many haue felt, and diuerse doe proue, and few can want. Of which numbre your grace hath made me one, that neyther leaste nor seldomest, haue tasted of your benefites, both in my trouble and also libertee. Wherfore your grace in my sight is of all other most worthy this smal fruite of my prisons labour, as a fitte patronesse to the honour of such a worke, and a trew example, in whom it is fulfilled. Thus the lord of trueth preserue you in freendship, encrease your frendes, and defend you from enemies.

Shew thy self trusty and sure to thy frende a poore mā, that thou maiest with hym reioyce in prosperitee: Obserue fidelitee to hym in tyme of calamitee, that thou maiest together with hym come into his possession. See (saith he) that thou loue thy frende: and shew thy selfe sure and trusty vnto hym: And if thou babble abrode his secretes, thou losest hym. Thus whan I remēbre, in howe many places of holy scripture, preceptes are geuen cōcernyng frendes and frendship: I dooe not a littell muse

and meruaile at the diuine gefte, that the most noble and excellent lerned man, the most worthy Romayne Mar. Tul. Cicero had: who in this his booke of Amitee here after folowyng, hath so eloquently, so liuely, so pithyly, and so plainely descriued and set out, what Amitee is, how to choose a frende, how muche is to bee doone for a frēde, how frendes shuld ponder requestes, what maner of menne are m

               ete for frendship, the propretee of true frendship, the principall cause of freendship, the chief poynct in frendship, the commoditees of frēdship, what thyng trieth frendes, the bondes of loue in frendship, the dissimulacion in

frendship, feigned freendship, the profite of freendeship, the fruite of frendship, the waies to proue freendes, what is to bee attributed to true frendes, what a freende ought to eschew, and so foorth the ende of freendeship, that I thynke there is no man, but that he maie learne out of the saide booke, all the poynctes needefull for hym, that will entre into, and cōtinue in that most happy & blissefull life of true frendship: wherby he maie so order and gouerne hym selfe, that at length he maie atteyne to that glorious name, to bee called a sure & a trusty frende. And certaynely no man can clyme so high (
                  •
                by the descripcion

of Tully) but he that is both good and wise, and that liueth vertuousely. And so, after the determinacion of Cicero, I maie conclude, that he that is a feithfull, a sure, and a trusty freende, muste needes bee a good, a wise, and a vertuous man.

                and not to sticke in al his kynde of comunicacion to call him wise. But I was so put to Scaeuola by my father, whan I came to mans state, that as nigh as I wel could or might, I shoulde neuer goe from the olde mans sleue. And therfore
               
I bare away many thynges wysely reasoned, and many thinges briefly and handsomly told, and sought by his wisdome to growe better learned. When he was dead, I gat me to P. Scaeuola, whom alone I dare boldly name the chefest of our citee for witte & knowlage, but an other time we shal speake of him, now I retourn to Scaeuola Augur. As he often talked of sundrie matters, so I remembre, sittyng at home in his half round chayre (as his maner was) when I and very fewe his familiars were presente, he fell into that talke, which then was almost common in many mens mouthes. For you remembre (as

I thinke) Atticus (and so muche the rather,Pom. Atticus.) because you haunted Sulpitius companie very muche. What a wonder of lamentacion of men there was, when he beyng Tribune of the people,P. Sulpitius Tribune. Q. Pōpeius Consull. disagreed from Q. Pompeius with a deadlie foode, who then was Consul, with whom very friendly and louynglie he had liued. Therfore at that tyme Scaeuola, when he fell in a rehersal therof, declared vnto vs the talke that Laelius had vpon friendship with hym and his other sonne in lawe C. Fannius, the sonne of Marcus, shortely after Affricanes death. The summe of whiche disputacion I bare awaie, and haue set it

foorth in this booke after my owne phantasie. For I haue brought in as it we

And therfore I my self readyng mine own workes, somtime am in that moode, that me thinketh Cato speketh and not I. But as then age with age did speake of age, so now to his freend the freendly writeth of frendship. Then spake Cato at those dayes, in a maner the eldest and wisest: Now speketh Laelius of frendship, a man both wyse (for so was he counted) and for the prayse of freendship the chiefest.
            I woulde for a whyle you mynded not me, but suppose that Laelius him self speaketh.

                  Lael.
                  Naie, this is as though ye would force me to speake. But what skilleth it, by what meanes you driue me to it, I take it truely, that ye force me. Yet to withstande the earnest desires of a mans freendes, especially in an honeste matter, partlie it is an harde thyng to doe, and partly not well standyng with reason. Wherfore many times thinkyng of frend shippe, this was woont to be chiefly weighed of me, whether for staie and for neede, menne ought to seeke for frēdship, to thentent that in doyng and takyng of pleasures, one mighte

receiue of another,Wherfore freendes are sought that he told not come to by him selfe, and after that sorte mighte requite others: and whether this were the very propertee of frēdship, or elles there were some other cause more ancient, more commendable, and more proceding of nature. For loue, wherof freendly loue and freendshippe commeth, is the chiefe cause, to fasten good willes together. Commoditees often times also bee gotten at their handes,Loue. whiche with flatteryng frenship be soughte vpon, and as tyme serueth, be attended vpō. But in frendshippe there is no faining, there is no dissēbling, and what so euer is in it, the same is true and vnforced.

Wherefore I am of opinion, that freendship toke his beginnyng rather by nature,Natural freēdship thē for any helpe of staie, and rather by the castyng of ones phantasie toward thother, with a certein felyng of loue, then by the thinkyng, howe muche profite mighte ensue of suche a thyng. The which surely what kinde of thyng it is, maie wel be vnderstande, euen in certeine beastes, whiche so tenderlie loue their yong ones for a certayne space, and be so loued of them again, that their nature soone appeareth: whiche thyng in man is muche more euident.
               
               Firste of the loue that is beetwene the children & parentes, whiche can not possibly without

For to what purpose were it, to say that these euils were in suche men? For if they had ernestlie required any thyng in that maner, I know thei could not haue obteigned, for asmuche as these we spake of, were very godlie men. But let it be

Another sort of them (thei saie) speake muche more beastelie yet then this, whiche place a littell aboue I briefely touched, and that was, that freendeshippe ought to bee desired for an healpe and staies sake, and not for good will and fauour to anie body.

And therfore as euery manne hath little staie, and little succour, so he shoulde the more seeke after freendship.

               ¶And nowe we must set out,Bondes of loue in frendship. howe farre the boundes and pointes of loue doe reache in freendeshippe. Whereof I see there be three opinions, and I allow neither of them. One is, that we so loue our freend, as we doe our selfes. The other, that our good will towarde

our freendes, doe a like and equallie answere theyr good will towarde vs.

But I agre to none of these three opinions. For the first is not trewe, that euery man, is a like herted towarde his freende, as he is towarde him selfe. For how many thynges enterprise we for our freendes sake, whiche for our selues we woulde neuer doe, as to praie and sue to an vnworthy man for our freendes cause: to be ouer earnestly bēt against one, and to pursue him very sore: whiche thynges in our owne mattiers stande not

well with honestie, but in our freendes causes bee moste honest. There be many thynges also, in whiche the honest sort, hoth take awaie and suffer to bee taken from theyr owne gaines, to thende their frendes rather than them selues, maie enioy them. The second opinion is, that appointeth freendship, to vse like benefites, and like good will, but this is to straight and to ne

geue no more than it maie receiue. Neither is there suche feare to bee taken in freendeship, that we lease not a good tourne, or let it fal in the mire, or that we heape not vp more benefites than iust measure. The thirde is the worst, which is, that how muche euery man maketh of himselfe, so muche he shoulde bee made of by his freende. But in some often tymes either th

The remembraunce and onthynkyng of the which thyngꝭ, if with hym thei had died, I coulde by no meanes haue borne the lacke of so freendly and louyng a man. But those nother be dead

yet, but rather nourished and encreased by the onthynkyng and remembraunce of theim. And although I shold wholy be bereft of them, yet myne age self wolde bryng my greattest comfort. For I could not very longe continew in this state. And all short griefes be sufferable, although they be great. These thynges be they, whiche I had to speake of freendship. And I doe exhort you, that you so esteame vertue, (with out which freendship can not bee possible) as sauyng it, ye thinke nothyng better than freendeship.
