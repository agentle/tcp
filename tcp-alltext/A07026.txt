            To the right Worshipfull, wise, and vertuous Gentleman, Maister Philippe Sidney, Esquire, the abundance of Gods grace, and all spirituall blessinges.
            
               IF notable knowelege (Right Worshipfull,) if perfect experience, if singular authoritie, if deserued dignitie, finallie, if anie excellent and spirituall ornament of Nature (or rather of God) be sufficient to winne credite, and to purchase praise: then must this be a necessarie consequent, that where many gifts of Gods grace do ioyntlie concurre and run together, there

credite hath continuance, and praise possession. Such a one is he, who by no lesse labour then learning, and by no lesse learning then iudgement, not onlie attempted, but also finished (to his no small commendation, being a worthie Gentleman, & hauing enough in ciuill and politike affaires otherwise to bestowe his studie, & his time,) this most profitable and true christian worke: which, though by reason of the manifoldnesse of the matter it be wearisome to reade, yet with such weight of wisedome, diuerse waies declared, that tediousnesse is so attenuated & diminished: that (as a footeman, hauing farre to goe, maketh lesse accompt of his labour, if the way be pleasant: and by the present viewe of cōfortable obiectes, is so rauished with delight, that he thinketh not vpon the length of his iournie:) in this booke, things are so tempered, that (as the best sawces

being made of sweete and sowre, doe please the taste) the reader shall feele him selfe in such sorte affected, that albeit the perusing thereof shall seeme passing painfull, yet (circumstances accordinglie considered, and point by point precisely pondered) it shall prooue exceeding fruitefull. Againe (Right worshipfull) as in building, not he which seeketh rather to be sumptuous then substantiall, but hee which endeuoureth to be both substantiall and sumptuous, deserueth most commendation: so in writing, not he which hunteth after the finest phrase, & sweetest style, neglecting (in the meane time) sensible matter, sauouring of iudgement: but hee, which hath the capacitie, both pithilie like a Logician, and pleasantlie like a Rhetorician, to leaue some proofe to the worlde of his witte and knowledge, is to bee had in admiration. In which thing,

because hee is excellent, by whome this booke was written, it importeth more then I am able to vtter: which, (whatsoeuer it be) I leaue to the cē
               sure of the wise. And nowe (Right worshipfull) somewhat superficiallie to touch the work it selfe: which I may well resemble to the Anatomie of mans bodie: wherein as wee may see the wonderfull wisdome of God, in the creation of mortall man, howe he hath powred life into the principall partes, as it were into certeine vesselles, and couered them with flesh, which I may boldly compare to clay, for the better preseruation and safe keeping of the same▪ howe cunninglie the whole body of man is builded and knitte together, with sinewes, veines, artires, ligatures, gristles, bones, muscles, & such like: so in this booke, beeing but a manuell, the verie secrets of the Romishe Church are so discouered,

(which in the opinion of the Pope and his consistorie, is high treason, and vnpardonable,) that verie babes and sucklings may beholde their abhominations, and spitte at their villanous practises, to them selues aduantageable, to the church of Christ offensiue, and to the glorie of God nothing more derogatorie. This notable booke therefore (Right worshipfull) I haue presumed to publish abroade, vnder your patronage and protection, not doubting that it should want credite, if it were not ouershadowed with the countenance of some speciall personage: but for that your disposition being so vertuous, as that you are a mirrour amōg men, & your course of life so praiseworthie, as that you may bee well thought a blossome of true Nobilitie: your worshipfull mind also being beautified & inriched with such rare ornamentes, as that you among

the rest, glister like a starre: therfore vnto your woorships handes haue I bin encouraged to present this worthie booke, translated and printed at my proper costes and expenses, not in hope of anie extraordinarie profite, (which howe litle I thinke vppon, let him iudge that knoweth all thinges,) but that the Churche of Christ, being not yet growen to perfect age & strength, maie reape some speciall benefite by the same. And thus hauing laide open, verie bluntlie, but plainlie, my simple (but yet honest) meaning, I committe your worship to the grace of God, which as it hath hitherto (no doubt) beene your direction, so I hope it shall, & (God graunt) it may be your loadesman to life euerlasting. Amen.

            To the Reader.
            
               GOod Christian Reader, thinke it not lost labour to reade this little booke, which as it beareth the name of a Bee hiue, so it conteineth good stoare of holesome honie. Neuertheles, take this short admonition by the way, that in reading the same, thou plaie not the parte of a Spider, which out of sweete and odoriferous floures sucketh deadlie poyson: for what is that else but to abuse a benefite, and to make that euill to thy selfe, which by nature is good? I knowe it spites the Papistes, that their iuglings are espied: and I beleeue they will be so farre from singing a Requiem for his soule, by whome it was compiled, or from pitie to purchase him a pardon from the Popes good grace, that they coulde finde in their heartes, to appeale to the Spanishe inquisition, and by their tormentes farre passing the paines of Purgatorie, to constraine both him, and them that shall reade it, to crie Peccaui. O charitable Catholikes. Be they such curst cattel in deede? Alas for pitie: God keepe vs out of their clawes. Will not

Peter pence salue vp the sore? O, yes marie, that is meate for their mouthes. But will they frette and storme in suche sorte? Tut a pointe, they haue had the raine too long, it is time that they bite on the bridle. But farewell Papist: R▪ this pill, ô it will scowre and purge. Thus Gentle Reader (to conclude) thou hast such a booke, as will make thee priuie to all the practises of the Babylonicall beast, (Rome I meane) the denne of Dragons and diuels: which if it were translated into other tongues, by the industrie of the learned, as it is in none, but in Dutch and English, it would increase choler so abundantly in the Pope, the Colledge of Cardinals, Monasteries of Monkes, Fraternities of Friers, Nestes of Nonnes, and the rest of the Pharisaical Frie, as whole handfuls of Helleborus, or pounds of Colloquintida can neuer auoide: & (wote you what?) that will pull downe their mother the holie Churche vppon her knees, with thought and sorowe. Well, I leaue the benefite of this booke to thy diligence in reading. And thus farewell.
            
               
                  Thine in Christ, Iohn Stell.
            
         
         
            
            This is a cleare and perfect interpretation of the Epistle of Maister Gentian Haruet, nowe latelie set foorth in French, and in Dutch, and directed to those, that are fallen from the true Christian beliefe.
            WHerein the full foundation, and profounde establishing of the holie Romishe beliefe is declared: all newe heresies confounded: the might, authoritie, and worthines of the Church of Rome, expounded, and by Scriptures confirmed: all dissentious articles put to silence, and a plaine demonstration, where the right Church is to bee founde. In summe, all the articles of the holie Catholike Romishe beliefe, are here drawne out of all sortes of flowres in the holie Scripture, olde Fathers, Councelles, Decrees, and Canons, gathered together, and as

in a sweete Bee hiue, brought all in one: and in the last is set forth, the manners, conditions, nature, and essence of Bees, the honie and honiecombe of this Bee hiue, collected out of the best olde writers, as well Grecians as Latinistes.

            To the right worshipful, holie, profounde, and learned Doctor, and Magister noster, Maister Franciscus Sonnius, nowe most woorthie Bishop of Shertoghenbosch, health and blessing from God,
                  Afterwarde Bishop of Antwerpe.
                  
                and the Pope our most holie father.
            
               RIght worshipfull, louing, and holie father and bishop, when I do well consider, & thinke vppon the noble, commendable, & woorthie deedes, which your honor (with the good helpe of the moste famous and deuoute Cardinall Grandvelle, and other good subiectes of the most holie Apostolicall Catholike Popish church of Rome,) haue (within these niene or ten yeares) taken in hande, and almost brought to passe, touching our ancient and wellnigh ouerthrowen Romish Religion, to proppe and vnderset the same with newe pillars, & strong styles▪ binding it with well twisted ropes, and cordes of the Spanish Inquisition: I must needes, and of right (in the name & behalfe of all my countriemen and inhabitants

of the base countries of Germanie) geue you worthie thankes, for the great alterations and changes, whiche within these fewe yeares haue happened and chaunced to the proofe, within the said lowe countries. For, had not your Honor, about the yeare 1558. in the time of the most holie Pope Iulie the fourth, stoutlie and diligentlie trauelled and obteined that these our base coūtries might be prouided for with newe Bishops, to serue for Inquisitours and accusers of heretikes and Huguenotes. Surelie, the case was such, that the Popes holines, with all his boothes and shoppes, must out of hande haue bene trudging out of these countries, and all by reason of this newe Gospell, which men woulde needes set forth: whereof your Bishops Myter, crosier staffe, and your laudable Inquisition, haue not read much, (considering that your Honor can content your self with your Portesse, & a canne of good rennish wine) whereof if it had so come to passe, a most pitifull case must needes haue followed: As especiallie, that a man shoulde scarse afterwardes haue founde anie one, that would haue saide Masse for monie:

yea, the Priestes themselues began to be so ashamed of their shauen crownes that in some places, they woulde haue beene glad to couer them with cowe doung, as in an olde prophesie is declared. The Bishops, the Prelates the holie Monkes and Chanons, the Inquisitoures and all idle officers of the spirituall courtes, shoulde not haue had anie more worke. I omit howe that the famous doctoures of Louen, the Licentiates and Bachelers of Diuinitie shoulde drinke no more Vinum Theologicum, or Vinum Cos,

                that is to say, of the persons fatte: but must haue taken patience with small ale and single beare, whereof they might soo
                  •
               e haue gotten the Collica passio. And where (I pray you) shoulde the foure holie begging orders haue become. And especially the deuout Franciscanes? should they not all (in generall) haue gone and hanged their cowles vpon the hedge? And then what should haue become of all the godlie ornamentes of the Churche, as braue altars, gylte christes, holie reliques, braue images, Copes of gold, siluer, and silke, and other moe suche like iewels, wherewith all the Churches and holie

Saints as well As well shee Saintes, as hee Saintes. Feminine, as Masculine, are decked vp and trimmed, which all the Byshops haue promised by solemne othe to mainteine and defend, to the vttermost of their powers. But what is all this to the purpose? The Masse, the Masse (I saie) yea, the holie blessed masse laie so extreemely sicke, that men began alreadie to sing a Requiem ouer her, the holie Saintes, did not get anie more liberall offrings, more sensinges, nor more pilgrimages. Yea, the people began alreadie to pul downe images from the alters. No man would geue any thing for pardons, nor for the Popes bulles: Yea, the hole staple of pardons, especially purgatorie, beganne to waxe coulde. The Pope himselfe was esteemed for an howlieglasse: The Decrees, and Decretals, the Sophisticall gloses, the sentences, the Quotlibets, and suche like toyes of the schollers and doctours of Louen, were cast behinde the benche: Satisfaction, and ful recompence were no more made anie accounte of: Auriculer confession was almost murdered: Shroue tuesday, and Iacke a lent had almost broken their neckes: all the holie and goodlie Processions

with the stately stations, Perambulations & going about the streetes, were esteemed for boyes plaie: the holie Sacrament was no more deuoutlie caried vp and downe with fiffes and drummes. In conclusion, all the holinesse, of the Catholike Church of Rome beganne to fall in the ashes: and in place thereof you should heare nothing else, neither in the townes nor without, yea, nothing was read but the Byble, or Saint Paule. The people would pray to none other, but to GOD alone, neither woulde haue anie other mediatour, but Christe Iesus, no
                  •
                put their trust and confidence in anie other thinges, but in his merites: No reioycinges but in his Crosse, death, and passion. They did onely esteeme for Sacramentes, Baptisme, & the Lords Supper, yea, and did vse the same very simply without anie stately station or ceremoniall brauerie, without coniuringes of the diuell, without spittle, without salt, without greasinges, & also without albes, surpleses, or coapes, without singing of Per omnia saecula saeculorum, or Dominus vobiscum. They would go no more to shrifte vnde
                  •
                their ghostlie Father, but to God aboue

or else before the whole congregation: They did not passe anie more for absolution, they woulde not praie anie more for the sillie soules, whiche lie in Purgatorie, but euerie one would groūd his praier vpon the holie scripture: They woulde acknowledge but one supreme heade of the Churche, namely, Iesus Christe the Sonne of God: They woulde haue Bishops, renouncing the name & office of tyrannical Inquisitors, to preache the gospell, to leaue of their trapt Horses and Mules, and goe on foote: They did esteeme all manner of meates, good and lawfull, first saying grace in their mother tongues: neither did they much regarde the eating of fleshe in Lent, no, not euen on Good Friday: In Summe, they went wholy about to bring in a new reformation of religion and discipline ecclesiasticall, the like whereof was neuer seene of the holie Churche of Rome, nor of our forefathers: They tooke in hande to restore all againe, to the olde and former state of the Apostles and Euangelistes. what pitie, what care, what sorowe, had this bene to our dearly beloued mother the holie Catholike Churche of Rome,

and to all her good subiectes? But praised be our blessed Ladie of Antwerpe, your honour did well foresee, and in time diligently withstand that inconuenience, in that you haue placed the inquisition in the lande, driuen away the Gewses or Heretikes, laide the Magistrates in prison,

                banished and brought to the Butchers stall the Gentlemen and good subiectes, made a way and open passage for the Spaniardes into the lande, set vp fire and swoorde in token of victorie, and in euerie corner reared vp gallowes, and plentifully shed the blood of those newe Euangelistes: In Summe, your diligence, your quicke expedition, your great zeale, your newe Bishoppes, and your holie Inquisition, haue so well aduised, counselled, perswaded (or rather forced) our Souereign Lord the king his Maiestie much rather to see the destruction of his Patrimoniall lande, the ruine of his Subiectes: yea, the imprisonment, and death of his owne onelie sonne, then to permit the holie Catholike Church of Rome to suffer suche shame: and that in place of the Popes decrees and decretals of the Masse booke Hortulus animae, and suche other

seruice bookes, the Gospel, & holy Scripture, onelie should succeed, & take possession. Therefore your Honour is highly to be praised for such noble actes: And euerie man is duely bound herein, to assist & further you in your enterprise, to the vttermost of his knowledge & abilitie.
            This (Right Honorable and blessed Bishop) is the cause, which hath moued me poore & vnworthie brother of Saint Frauncis order, to dedicate and sende this my simple present to your honour, to the ende that I (with this my small gifte of good will) may somewhat (though but a little) helpe to strengthen & repaire the decaied walles of the Romishe Church, and establish againe the right & perfect foundation of our most holie father, the Pope. Therefore hauing a while agoe: seene & marked that in the Citie of Antwerpe was a small booke sette foorth in French & Flemish, intituled & named A Letter Missiue: Or, An Epistle directed vnto the Apostates & Backsliders, from the true Christian beleefe, compiled and made by Maister Gentian Heruet, &c: And for that the same booke was greatly desired, and verie much esteemed of all good and Catholike

hearts: I haue (with all diligence and circumspection) perused and read ouer the same: wherein I haue founde in effect, that in the same is briefly declared and set foorth the whole grounde and foundation of the holie Romish religion, which your Honour, euen with fire and swoorde, to the subuersion and vtter ruine of the whole land, doth seke most zealously to mainteine. And I am thereby persuaded, that the same booke was most worthie to be read ouer of all men, to the ende that all startbackes from the faith, might returne into the right way: and the good faithfull Catholikes thereby strengthened & confirmed. But nowe considering the saide booke to bee verie shorte, and something darke for a matter of suche importaunce, and likewise had either none or verie few proofes out of the Scriptures, Councels, holie Fathers, and Decrees of the Popes: therefore I haue thought good to set penne to Paper, and to set foorth and declare the same at large, that nothing needefull should be lacking. Moreouer cōsidering that it is most necessarie, to declare something more at large, especially touching

the woorthines, and authoritie of the holie Churche of Rome, and the true exposition of the holie Scripture: wherevppon the summe of all our matters doe depende, for that we haue alwayes beene forced to call vpon the Church, & especially now, when there is none other shield or defence left vnto vs: therefore haue I traueiled brieflie to shew of this matter, where the sure grounde and foundation lies, by what Scriptures, by what holie fathers, by what Councels, & by how many Decrees euerie point is defended: and likewise howe and in what manner the Scripture and the holie Church of Rome are ioyned together, and Catholikelie vnderstoode in suche order, as the same shall in no wise serue the Heretikes anie thing at al to their purpose or aduantage. And forsomuch as this woorke is sucked out of sundrie sortes of flowres gathered together: therefore haue I named it, The Bee hiue of the Romishe Churche, thereby to geue to vnderstande▪ that as the honie Bee, doeth not gather her honie out of one flowre alone, but out of manie and diuerse: So doeth not the Churche of Rome stande vpon one Scripture, Byble,

Councels or bokes of Decrees, but doth catche and snatch out of eche of them, that which best serueth her purpose, as hereafter euerie man may plainelie perceiue, and in the ende of this booke shall vnderstande more at large, whereas the speciall causes are set foorth, why and wherefore we haue christened this booke with such a name. And now, hauing vnderstoode that your Honour did a good while agoe set foorth a certaine booke, against the confessiō of the faith of these newe Gospellers, I did verie earnestly trauell to gette the same, trusting that it might (perhaps) haue eased me of this my labour, for that I thought your Honour shoulde haue set foorth these matters there at large. But after that I had superficially and lightly reade ouer the saide booke, (not hauing the lucke to kepe the same lōg by me.) I was the more willing to set foorth this my Bee hiue, for that I sawe it shoulde serue verie well, to the opening and more plaine declaration of the foresaide booke, which your Honour hath made and published: considering that your honour is busie in euerie place with the aucthoritie and dignitie

of the holie Churche, of her ordinances or constitutions, additions, or traditions, and of the spirituall exposition, which shee hath made vppon the Scriptures: & perceiuing nothing to be clearly set foorth, whereby one may finde out these constitutions and ordinances, whether in the Scripture, in the Fathers, in the Decrees, or in the Coūcels: so that a simple man might alway stande in doubt, what you will haue esteemed and holden for the commaundementes ordinances, or traditions of the Churche, and what men shall call the Churche, and likewise what rule or inuiolable order this holie Churche doth commonly keepe and vse in the exposition of the scriptures, but I thinke your Honour did leaue this vndone, as our saide Maister Gentian Haruet did, especially, because it was to small and slight a matter for you to trouble your mytered head with all. And therefore haue I gladlie taken vppon me this paine and trauell, and haue clearely sette forth in this my booke, vpō what ground and foundation all these thinges are builded: So that the necessarie vse of this booke is vnspeakeable as euerie good

Catholike shall well perceiue of him self. And forsomuch as herein is not written anie thing, but it doeth agree aswell, yea, better with the said booke made by you, thē with Gentians booke, I would gladly haue it set forth, as an Exposition, Glose, or Cōmentarie vpon your foresaid prettie booke: but considering that I had not anie copie of your said booke in my custodie, and fearing also least your Honor might haue bene offended, that any man should take vppon him to expounde or comment vpon your writings, which are as cleare as hellishe sunne, euen as your owne name Sonnius doth signifie: so that I haue proceeded with my first determination, thinking it sufficient for me, if I might hide this my trauell vnder the winges of your Honor, like as vnder the same, all our newe Bishops haue beene hatched. Most humblie beseeching your Honor, to accept this my simple gifte in good parte, and as becommeth such a worthie Bishop to do, trusting yet (within short time) to set foorth more such woorkes, and thereby so preciselie to expounde all the bookes that are set out

by your Honour, and other doctoures of Louen your companions, that a blinde man may feele them with his handes: yea, and without spectacles or candle, conceiue what greate holines lies hid in such coafers. You may (if it please you) in the meane space accept this my woorke, as an explanation and commentarie, vpon your booke, which to doe resteth at your pleasure and good will. And herein I commende your Byshopps Myter and crosyers staffe vnto the tuition of our holie Father the Pope, who preserue and keepe your Honour with all your brethren our new Byshoppes, in prosperous estate and proceedinges against all Heretikes.

            THis deepe grounded and most learned Epistle of the right worshipfull Doctour, Maister Gentian Heruet, directed to those, that are declined & fallen from the holie Romishe Catholike Church, is deuided into sixe speciall and principall partes: whereof the first is:
            1 That the Heretikes and Huguenotes cannot repute them selues for faithfull people, so farre forth as they do not beleeue all things, which our louing mother the holie Church beleeueth, without whom no saluation can be obteined: & especiallie, for that they will not beleeue the Transubstantiation of the breade into the verie bodie of Christ.
            2 The second is knitte to the first: namelie: They mainteine iniuriouslie, that wee ought to allowe nothing, but what is mainteined by Scripture.
            3 Thirdlie: They doe not beleeue nor

allowe of seuen Sacramentes, especiallie▪ Auricular confession, the sacrament of Matrimonie, and the holie ointment of Vnction.
            4 Fourthlie: They doe the Catholikes great iniurie: insomuch as they repute them for idolaters and worshippers of idols.
            5 Fifthlie: They seeke nothing else, but fleshlie libertie, and their owne appetites.
            6 Sixthlie & lastlie: Their Preachers are vnlearned Doultes, and leade a lewde, loathsome, and wicked life.
            In these sixe pointes is brieflie rehearsed the whole grounde and foundation of the holie Catholike doctrine, taught by the Romishe Church▪ and is so gallantlie established: yea, and all the Heretikes so finelie fetche ouer the coales, that there remaineth not a iotte to be spoken of anie further. Yet, seeing the ground and meaning of this Epistles Authour, did stretch chieflie to challenge the Heretikes foorth into the fielde, and then Championlike, to combate with them: (like as hee sheweth that not long since the noble Knight, Maister Nicholas Villegaignon, who by his writing thought

to egge foorth Maister Iohn Caluine, and by that meane to haue wonne a perpetuall fame, and euerlasting memorie.) It is euen in like sorte fallen out with this good fellowe, as it did with the saide Villegaignon. For his happe was, the better to fitte his purpose, to set downe (as hee before mencioned) manie doubtfull partes, verie darke and obscure reasons, yea, and some somewhat grose, supposing herewithall (as with a baight) to drawe the fishe into his net. Whereby (alas) it came to passe, that his good and godlie meaning was spelde and construed a wrong waie, and the Heretikes did seeme to make a mocke of it, as though he were vnworthie to haue an answere to the same, considering that hee did shewe verie litle scripture or authoritie to affirme his matter: Euen in like manner as they had in times past iested with the foresaid Villegaignon.
            
            Therefore it hath seemed both good and necessarie vnto vs, and for the preferrement of the holie Romishe Church, most auaylable, that this present Epistle shoulde be at large declared: and verie strong and apte authorities to be brought in, for euerie part and parcell of the same, collected aswell

out of the Scripture, as out of the bes
                  •
                and fittest bookes of the auncient Fathers, Councels, and Decrees, wherewithall our louing mother the holie Churche is most supported: to the ende wee should the better conceiue the costlie hidden treasures, which are comprehended in this short Epistle: and that eache might vse the same to his most aduantage, and for a publike instruction, hoping (thorough this holie and meritorious worke) to purchase heauen, and withall to redeeme and set free two or three soules out of Purgatorie.

            ¶ Here followeth the declaration of the first parte of the Epistle of Gentian Haruet: wherein is treated, what the holy Church of Rome is: wherein her power and authoritie doeth consist: and how farr
                  •
                the same extendeth: then is cōcluded, That the Lutherans & Huguenotes can not be esteemed or taken for true beleeuers: but must be banished and burnt for Heretikes.
            
               The first Chapter. VVherein is plainly declared, that the Luthera
                     ••
                   and Huguenotes are Heretikes, and ought to be burnt: notvvithstanding, that as vvell by Scripture, as by many examples, they shevve themselues to be the very Church of God.
               
                  AND to the intent that wee maye orderly deale,
                     Lutheran
                           ••
                         & Huguenotes are Heretikes▪
                     
                   beginning first with one piece, and after proceeding with an other: our Maister Gentianus doeth here in his 
                     〈◊〉
                   charge, set forth such a noble grounded and sharpe wittie reason, to founde and builde his argumentes vpon, that the Heretikes and Huguenotes stand alreadie so amazed and ashamed, as a horse that hath ouerthrowen his carre.
               
                  
                  You poore Heretikes (saieth he) howe can you be of a true beleefe, if you do not first accept the twelfe articles of the faith? And how should you accept them, seeing you will not beleeue the holy Catholike Church?
               
               For consider this, he doeth take to serue his turne, a most certeine and vndoubted point, That no man can beleeue the holie Church, but hee must ioyntly withall receiue and accept all, whatsoeuer the saide Church doth set forth and beleeue. And this is greatly to be cōsidered: seeing herevpon doth rest the most spe
                     •
                  ial ground and strongest bulwarke of the holy Church of Rome. For these Heretikes can very stedfastly say,Church of God and Heretikes. that they thēselues are the church of God. And to 
                     〈◊〉
                   that, they introduce and bring in many goodly textes out of the Scripture: but they alledge them only according to the letter: euen as though the Church were nothing els, but an assemblie or congregation of holy men, that is to say, of such as through faith or beleefe are by the bloud of Iesus Christ blessed and chosen to be the sheepefolde of Iesus Christe the true and only sheepheard of our soules:
                     Ioh. 10.3, 4, 
                        •
                     , 14, 25. into which fold none are receiued, but such

alone as will hearken to the onely voyce of that onely shepheard, and followe and goe after him onely, forsaking and not knowing the voyce of any straunger.
               Whereby they will nowe conclude, that our great Maister the Pope, with all the right honourable Bishops and Prelates, (which haue of them selues set forth manie goodly ordinances,
                     Iohn 10.1
                        •
                     
                   whereof Christ neuer knewe word) should be those very straungers and hirelings, which seeke onely the wooll of the sheepe, and haue serued God feignedly, setting forth and teaching the commandements and doctrine of men: yea,
                     Mat. 15.9. that they shuld be the theeues and murtherers, that haue not entred in at the right doore which is Iesus Christ,
                     Ioh. 10.9. but are crept in a wrong way, to steale, kill and destroye. And therfore do they cut vs cleane off, notwithstanding what soeuer wee alleadge of the Church of God, and of her authoritie, power and woorthines. But they alledge out of the Prophet Ieremie, That al is but lyes and deceyt whervpon we establish our selues, crying with ye Iewes,
                     Iere. 7.4. 
                  The Church of God, The Church of God, The Church of God. And herevpon doe they bring vs forth and alledge their Paul, saying,
                     Ephes. 2.20. That

the only true ground and foundation of the Church of God is established onely vppon the doctrine of the Prophetes & Apostles: so that who soeuer he be that falleth from the same, can not be accompted for a true member of Christs Church. And then they bring forth an Esaie out of a corner, and an Ezechiel, an Oseas, with diuers other out of the olde Testament, which they set al together on a heape, and will defend themselues therewith, that the stedfast successiō and that long continued race of the Popes, Cardinals, Bishoppes, and Archbishops, are in no wise that right token, and that vncounterfeyt marke of the Church, but ye onely the sincere worde of God: when as that is in our mouthes and in our heartes, and in the mouthes and heartes of our children,
                     Esai. 59.21. accompanied with the right vse of the Sacraments, according to the perfit ordeining of Christ Iesus, who is the only head of the Church and congregation: in whom all people are ioyntly vnited, euery one according to the measure of the gift which he hath receiued of the head,
                     Ephe. 4.15, 16. to the ful growth of the whole body in loue. Well, well: when they haue done all their prating,
                     Colo. 1.18. and 2.19. yet must this needes be true: That they are but Heretikes,

and smel after the fagot, the good yere and all, the cause why: For that they doe not beleeue all that the holy Church doth beleeue, and without the Church is no saluation: but all such as fall from her, must be burnt like fagottes: for to that end haue we a plaine text of Scripture, which saith thus:
                     Iohn 15.6. which witnes is to this purpose set foorth of Iohn Audre as Panormitanus, Hostiensis, Bernardus Lutzenburgen. in the 4. boke of the Heretikes in the 5. part, and by other moe Catholike wr

               And this same is apparent out of the second point of this Epistle nowe folowing: Whereas Gentianus doeth openly cōfesse, that at al times and for euer, there haue bin some men which haue helde the same opinions, & set forth the like learning, that these Lutheranes and Huguenotes do nowe followe. But he answereth the matter thus: That such haue alway bene banished and cursed for heretikes: and all this is verie true.

                   For euer since that Iohn the Archfather, Patriarch of Constantinople, began to take vpon him to be the vniuersall Bishop of all Bishops within Christendome: which attempt the Pope of Rome dyd in the beginning stoutly withstande: and that

                   and was by the Emperour Phocas declared Cheefe or superiour Bishop ouer all Christendome, and ordeined the head of the Church: which thing was brought to passe in the yeere of our Lord 680. From that time forward (I saye) there haue alwayes bene many factious and busie fellowes stirring abroade, which as well by writing, as preaching, haue withstoode the Pope, and condemned his doctrine, decrees and ordinances, euen by the Scripture: yea, and blazed and set him selfe forth for an Antichrist,Popes acco

But, as before is declared, such haue alwayes bin reputed and condemned for Heretikes. Therefore, to the ende that no man shall thinke this to be nowe a new dealing of the holy Church, to condemne these Lutheranes and Huguenotes for Heretikes: and likewise, that no man shall suppose, that this their doctrine and Articles, which they set forth are first

                     Iohannes the 23. pope. and by many wordes defended the cause, That first there was but one only Church, whereof he ought to be the head, vnder whom all Christendome ought to submit them selues: they dyd againe sende him this answere which followeth.The Grekes do answere pope Iohn. This doth Iohn Man-deuil write of in his 7. booke.

               Notwithstāding that some of their Embassadours did in the Councell of Ferrara, in the tyme of Pope Eugenius 4. agree therevnto:

But long before that time, not onely the cōmon people of the Greekes, but the Emperours them selues likewise, were aduersaries to the Pope of Rome: about the setting vp and praying to Images. For about the yere of our Lord 730. the Emperors Constantine 5. and 6. and Leo Isaurus,

                  That men should in no wise, for the seruice of God,
                  Images forbidden & despised. 
                  neither set vp, nor pray to anie Images: but did likewise vtterly break down & destroy al Images before made and set vp.
               
               
                  The cause wherefore the Popes did diuide the EmpireFor which cause the Popes of Rome did conceiue such malice and hatred against them, that from thence forth, they sought al maner of meanes and wayes to diuide and

ouerthrowe the Emperial state: like as in continuance of time they brought it so to passe. And likewise, not only the Greekes,
                  The Grekes and the Germanes did withstande the forbidding of priestes to marie, 
                        •
                     il Boniface 8. did set it vp by force. Berthramus
                   but the Germanes also, did long time withstand the forbidding of Priestes to marrie, till at length the Popes (and that specially Bonifacius 8.) did by maine force bring it to passe, and establishe the same.
               In the yere 840. one Berthrame, a stout and a learned man, rose vp, who did manfully withstande the Romishe doctrine, as touching their Transubstantiation, dedicating to Charles the French King, brother of Lothorius, a notorious booke made for that purpose: and did likewise in an other booke confirmed by the Scriptures,
                     Nota.
                   and strongly defended by the holy Fathers, set forth the doctrine of Predestination, which these Heretikes do nowe so earnestly stand vpon. And about the yere 869. did Iohannes Scotus followe him,
                     Io. Scotus.
                   writing against Transubstantiation,

                  Huldrike Bishop of Auxburge, by his writing reuoked again the saide commaundement of forbidding Priestes to marrie. After whom, about the yere 1240. Bernard started vp,
                     Bernardus.
                   who wrote

very much of Predestination, and against Freewill: nothing vnlike the doctrine of the Lutheranes and Huguenotes: yea, and did very stoutly striue against the Priestes and Prelates, calling them, The seruantes of Antichrist: and making of the Prelates, Pilates.
                     Iohannes Sarisburien.
                   Whom in the yere 1157. Iohannes of Sarisburie did folowe, and wrote a booke called Obiurgium Clericorum: and another named Polycraticus: wherein hee doeth pull the whole Clergie vengeably ouer the coles, and setteth them out for Phariseis and false teachers: calling the Pope, Antichrist: and Rome, The hoore of Babylon. And likewise a litle before that, had Arnolde the Bishop of Brixen set vp earnestly against the Priestes, denying flatly, that the sworde of gouernement should anie whit apperteyne vnto them: yea, euen at the same time was there one Peter Bloix,
                  
                     Petrus Bloix.
                   which wrote openly thus:
               
                  That Rome was the right Babylō, wherof S. Iohn did prophesie: and that the Officialles of the Romish Court were deuilish Griphines:
                  Deuilish Griphines. 
                  and the Priestes, verie Calues of Bethel, Baals Priests, Aegyptiacal idols: and that euery thing was to be solde at Rome for money.
               
               
                  About the same time in the yere 1160. started vp in France a quicke fellowe, and a worshipfull Burgesse of the Towne of Lyons, named Petrus Valdo,
                  
                     Petrus Valdo.
                   who hauing studied the Scriptures very diligently, began to set vp a newe doctrine, which did hit as iust vpon the doctrine of these Huguenotes, as might be. He left manye Disciples after him, in so much that a remnant is remayning yet to this day. After that came Petrus de Vinea,
                  
                     Petrus de Vinea.
                   Chauncelour to the Emperour Frederike 2. and was in the yere 1240. who went about likewise to robbe our holy father the Pope of his intituled authoritie and iurisdiction, ray
                     •
                  ing vpon him out of measure. And after came Guilielmus de sancto Amore,
                  
                     Guilielmus de sancto Amore.
                   in the yeere 1260. who layde loade exceedingly vpon the Prelates, Monkes, and Friers: and did reckon them for subiectes of Antichrist. Whose opinions were after in the yeere 1275. by one Laurence an Englishe Doctor at Paris, stoutly defended and cōfirmed. Againe, in the yere 1306. came abroad one Petrus Cassiodorus, a Gentleman,
                     Petrus Cass.
                   and very well learned: who did altogether spil the potage. For his writing and doctrine was, euen as though he had studied all the dayes

of his life in the bookes of Luther and Caluin: and he made of the Pope a Nabuchodonosor. After that, in the yere 1314. did followe one Dulsimus of Nauarra.
                  
                     Dulsimus.
                   And in the yeere 1315. Arnoldus de villa Noua, who caried water all ouer one bridge. And at last, in ye yere 1383. came forth the great Archeheretike Iohn Wiclef,
                  
                     Iohn VViclef.
                   who threw all the spindles of the holy Church of Rome in the ashes: for he was a naturall Zwinglian, or Caluinist: and of him sproong vp Iohn Hus,

                   and a number of other more: all which yet were by the Church of Rome banished and condemned for heretikes: yea, & where they could be gotten, put to death.
               In summe, all such, as at any time haue taken vpon them, to set forth any like matter against the Church of Rome, haue alway bene of the most holy Popes banished and accursed, together with all them which would by any meanes mainteyne or defend them. In so much, that Emperours and Kings: yea, whole countries haue (for withstanding the Pope) bene excommunicated and condemned for heretikes: yea, & (which is of greater importance) one Okam,
                  
                     Okam and Dante.
                   and Dante, good Catholike men, were by Pope Benedict 3. condemned for Heretikes: only because they did mainteine, That Emperours holde their Empires of God, and not of the Pope: and yet notwithstanding, that in all other matters they did throughly professe the Popes doctrine.
               
                  I say nothing, what is meete to be done to these new Heretikes, who go about to roote out and destroy the whole foundation of the Romish schole, and take vpon them to face vs out with their Paul, with

their Esaie & their Ieremie. What a mischiefe! Do they not know that those fellowes, whome they alledge and bring vs forth, were likewise esteemed for Heretikes, as well as they are themselues? Yea▪ in so much that one of them was hanged, another was burnt, the third clouen thorough the middest with a saw, the fourth set vpon a wheele, &c. And therefore are we no more moued for them, than for a bladder full of beanes.
               
               For the holy Church of Rome would neuer accept their doctrine, but vpon this bargaine and condition, to wit, that shee might alway applie the same as she should thinke good, and as might best come to passe for her selfe: and that no reuoking, nor reuolting, nor appellatiō should be made against her doings: no, nor that the name of Iesus Christ should in that case serue: like as shall by vs shortly in the part next folowing be declared at large. For this verely is most true, that if our blessed Lorde him selfe, would haue followed the exposition and cō
                  mentarie,The Phariseis gloses. which the Priestes, Phariseis, & Doctours had at that time made vpon the holy Scriptures, in the name of the holye Church, he had neuer bene crucified, or hanged

vpon the crosse. But because that hee would (full wisely) go and bring in newe matters, and so set vp a newe reformation, according to the text and doctrine of the Gospell (like as these Heretikes go about nowe to do) therfore did they deale so hardly with him. Notwithstanding that, nowe since the holy Church of Rome hath so finely handled and set forth this newe religion of Christ, and brought it vnto such a trim frame, that nowe it is very gladly receyued of euery one in a maner: yea, and if it were so, that these Huguenotes would accept the same, setting it forth likewise, surely, men would no more be so readie to bring them to a stake, as heretofore they haue done: yea, and pretend hereafter to do.
               But nowe, to come to our matter againe, it is necessarie, that we well consider, and substantially declare, wherein the worthines and authoritie of the holy Church doth specially consist: & what commandements, traditions, and ordinances of the same, men must receyue and accept, without all contradiction or gainsaying.
               And this (for so much as our Doctors of Louen are troubled with so manye other profounde and deepe questions, that they

haue not the leasure to set out this point effectually) is notwithstanding, the right ground and foūdation of all their building: yea, and is most needefull to our saluation, and to the extirpation and rooting out of all heresies. For it may be demanded, Whether men shall holde for commandementes and traditions of the Church, only & alone, that which is plainely set forth in the scriptures of the olde and newe Testamentes? Or els, that which the olde holy Fathers & Doctours, as Augustine, Chrysostome, Hierome, and such like haue left behinde them in their bookes and writings: or a great deale rather, that which hath ben concluded in the holy Councels: either els that which the holy Popes of Rome haue ordeined and enioyned: or, last of all, that which is scraped together out of the one and the other: all layd in one Pastie, and baked in one Cake: and which is nowe in our dayes obserued in the holy Catholike Church of Rome?
               
            
            
               The 2. Chapter. VVhereby is declared that the Church, vvith her povver and authoritie, can not be inclosed vvith in the pales of the holy Scripture, but that the Church may adde to the Scripture, or take from it, vvhat she thinkes good: and therevpon are many examples, and profoūd reasons alledged.
               
                  VPon this demande & profound proposition, very much might be saide:The church is aboue the Scripture. but we will make short of the matter. And to begin withal, we conclude with our Master Gentianus, and with the holy Coū
                  cell of Trent, That all they which woulde inclose the power and the authoritie of the Church within the limites & bounds of the holy Scripture, (as though the holy Catholike church of Rome could reade no further, than is spelled before to her in the Bible) are euill and naughty heretikes: yea, they are euen of those Apostataes or backsliders, to whom our Master Gentianus hath written this his Epistle. For as touching that, for the defence of their opinions, they bring forth, howe it is written, That none shall either put to it,
                     Deut. 4.1, 12, 32. Pro. 30.6. Apo. 22.18. This is thus set forth by Ioh. Ecki

                   or take from it one iote: that is simply spoken to the Iewes Rabbines onely: so that they should not take any such thing vpon them, as to change any words of the texte, and to correct Magnificat, like as they haue presumed to do, as mē may see clearly & without a candle, by the honourable Bishop Guilielmus Blindasinus, in his booke intituled, De optimo genere interpretandi: w
                     ••
                  ch is to say, Of the best and surest maner of

expounding or interpreting. For therein he doeth shew very plainly, that al Hebrew textes of the Bible are falsified, and embaced, by the Iewes: yea, and the like is done to all the textes in Greeke of the new Testament, by some Heretikes & enemies of the trueth. So that neither Christ, nor his Apostles, nor anie of the olde Doctours, should haue had the right Bible, but onelie our most holy Catholike Church of Rome, which only was borne vnder the right Planet, and shee alone hath shot downe the Popingaie. Therefore must the texte, before specified, be vnderstoode and meant of the Iewes alone, and of such like Heretikes, which haue so falsified the textes of the Bible.
               But you may not gather by this, that the holy Church of Rome is not licenced to ad vnto the Scripture, whatsoeuer shee doeth marke to be yet lacking, and to innouate, change, and remoue al that tendeth not perfectly to her purpose. For you see daily, that she doeth freely take vpon her so to do: and furthermore, she doth punish for ranke Heretikes, all such as will not allowe and accept her adding, and changing, for the perfite worde of God.

Item, look in Thomas de Aquino vpō the ten commandements, and vpon al the catholike doctours euerie one of them. All which haue cleane left out the seconde commandemēt▪ in the lettting foorth of the ten commandements. Mat. 26.27. Ma

                      Marke, touching this, the Master of the Sentences in the 4. booke the 12. dist. 4. ca. And vpon the Encherid. of Eckius in the booke of Bernard of Luxen. In the 12. part of the 4. booke of Heretikes, and in al other Catholike writers, who do specially treate of this matter. that shee hath finely conueyed out of the Register of ye ten commandements, the seconde commandement, which was, That no Images should be made, nor fashioned: because shee did perceiue, ye Heretiks would alledge ye same, to the hinderance both of he & she Saintes, which stand vpon the altars in the Church.
               Furthermore, because men shuld not lacke the number of ten, shee hath taken the last commandement, speaking of desire, and diuided the same in two, & so made the tailes agree iust. And likewise, notwithstanding that our Lord Iesus Christ had openly cō
                  manded, That the Communion should bee ministred, as wel with wine as with bread: yet the holy Catholike Church of Rome, considering the great daunger which was therein, for that the wine might be spilt: or being in the winter, freeze: or be turned into sowre vineger: if it should be long kept in a Pixe, or litle Sacrament Boxe. And especiallye, considering that when they shoulde haue dealte the Wine abroade,

the common people might haue thought, whether that the long racked bodye were without bloud, or at the least, that there could be no right and perfite Transubstantiation and changing of the bread into the very body of our Lorde Iesus Christe. In this behalfe hath she cōsidered further, and hath bene better aduised than our Lord him selfe was: and so hath forbiddē the laie people the Chalice.This standeth in the third booke of the Coū
                     cels, in the Councell of Constance, in the 14. session. For thus the Councel of Constance doeth decree, That notwithstanding Christ, after supper, did ordeyne and minister vnto his Disciples the most blessed Sacrament vnder both kindes of bread and of wine. And although that in the first ancient Church of the faithfull, the same was alwayes vsed vnder both kindes: neuerthelesse, seeing that the contrarie vse & custome is not without great occasion, and willingly now put in vre, for the auoyding and eschewing of some inconueniences and perilles: therefore shal all Patriarches, Prelates, Archbishops, & Bishoppes, curse and excommunicate all such, as shall take vpon them to minister vnto the common people the Sacrament in that maner. And so far forth as such do not turne & recant, then they to be deliuered

into the handes of the temporall Iudges to be by them arbitrally executed. And herevpon did the President of ye Councell, named Ostiensis, in the name of all the whole College of Cardinals, and all other Bishops after him, answere, Placet: which is to say, So it pleaseth vs. So that it is euident, that the ancient maner & good meaning of the Church maye cleane alter & vtterly abolish the commandement of Christ, & the olde custome of the Apostles, & their Disciples. We do likewise see, yt notwithstanding S. Paul (by inspiration of the holy Ghost) cōmanded,1. Cor. 7.9. and 2. 
                  That whosoeuer did feele that weakenes in him selfe, that hee could not liue chaste, should take a wife: for that it was better to marrie than to burne. And he did (in a maner by speciall words) command the same to the Bishops and other Ministers of Gods worde, saying: That they should haue their wiues & their children brought vp in the feare of God. And further, That mariage is holy,

               And yet, all this notwithstanding, our holy Mother the Church of Rome, seeing

deeper into the matter: and for the eschewing of manie inconueniences,This is set foorth in plain words in the Decrees of the Popes in the Chap. Proposuisti, in the 82. dist. and in the Chap. Decreminus the 22. dist. and in the chap. Tene. the 31. dist. it is likewise in the book of the Sentences, in the 17. dist. 
                        •
                     n the 4 chap. hath expresly and slatly commaunded Priestes, Bishoppes, and al spiritual persons, that they in no wise shall take vpon them the state of Matrimonie, teaching precisely the contrarie to the doctrine before specified, That the state of Matrimonie, is nothing else, but plaine vncleanesse, filthie, and shamefull: yea, a great and foule spot vnto carnall copulation: In so much, that such, as giue themselues therevnto, cannot be acceptable before God: for that it is writtē: Who so liues after the flesh, cannot be acceptable before God: and haue therefore concluded, that it is not decent, that a holy Priest, who is the temple of the holy Ghost, should become a slaue to the lying with a woman, and to fleshly lust. Like as in the Popes decrees and Decretales is specially set forth.
               Moreouer, touching the same point, it is concluded in the saide Decrees,In the 4. Epist. of Pope Cere. in the first book of coū
                     cels fol. 422 col. 2. and 423. That the doctrine of the holy Church, is nowe more perfite, than either the doctrine of Iesus, the sonne of God, or of his Apostles, hath bene in times past. For thus the text saith, Before that the Gospell was corrected, amended,

and expounded,
                  This standeth euen thus word for word in the booke of Decrees in the chap. Sors nō est, causa. 26. quaest. 2. 
                  there were manie things permitted, which nowe, since the time is come, that all the doctrine is made perfit, are clearely abolished and taken away, as especially, notwithstanding that the mariage of Priests was neither by the Lawe, by the Gospell, nor the doctrine of the Apostles, forbidden, yet hath the holy Church flatly forbiddē the same.
               
               We do likewise plainely see, that Iesus Christ hath streightly forbidden,
                     Math. 5.32.19, 7. Mar. 10.4. Luke 16.18. 1. Cor. 7.10, any dispē
                  sation for Matrimonie, & hath specially declared, That who soeuer doeth leaue his wife (except it be for adulterie) and doth marie another, is a whooremonger.
               
               Truly, if it were not that our holy mother the Catholike Church of Rome, had full power & authoritie aboue Gods word, and aboue ye special cōmandement of Christ: she would neuer haue takē vpō her to haue chā
                  ged nor put down this mariage of priests.
               Now let vs further see, that the most holy & honorable Popes Iulius, Innocentius, & Colestinus, being with a great number of Bishops & Prelates stately & iudicially assembled in ye holy Ghost, in S. Peters church at Rome, haue cōcluded, iudged, & pronoū
                  ced, whatsoeuer Christ notwithstāding had

thereof spoken & saide. That if so be there were anie which were married together,Christning breakes matrimonie of the common & laye people. and had christened the children at ye fount, the one of the other before should be diuorced: and the woman to haue her marriage good restored backe againe, and within a yeere after, it should be lawfull for her to marie another man: and for him to marrie another woman.
               Euē as our holy father ye pope of Rome, Deus dedit doth openly testifie in a letter,
                     Deus dedit.
                   which for a perpetuall memorie is written in the booke of Councels, word for worde: and likewise entred in the Register of the Popes decrees and ordinances: yet, ouer & besides this,In the chap. Peruenit, causa 31. quaest. 1. the holy Church hath concluded, that if any Nonne, Baggine sister, or other, should marie a husbande, the Bishop of that Diocesse, where they dwelt, should diuorce them,

                     . & cause the Nonne to returne and take vpon her againe her vowe of chastitie. Like as in Concilio Triburino, and by the Popes lawes is concluded & commanded. Out of the same authoritie hath the foresaid holy Church likewise cōcluded, That what woman soeuer after the decease of her first husband, should marrie agayne, shee was an open and common harlotte,

not regarding at all that which S. Paule in his time had written directly to the cō
                  trarie:
                     Rom. 7.2.3. 1. Cor. 7.9.28. 1. Tim. 5.14. yea, had moreouer straitly charged and commanded the yong widowes, That vnlesse they coulde well liue a continent and chast life, they should marie againe.
               
               After this, did not S. Paul, or rather the spirit of God by the mouth of S. Paul, directly forbid any straunge language to be vsed in the Churches and congregations,Strange languages in the Church. ordeyned for the seruice of God: neither in prayer, nor in thankesgiuing, nor in singing, nor in prophesying? Yea, he did greatly rebuke the Corinthians for so doing in their congregations.1. Cor. 14. the whole chapter thorough. And yet men plainly see, that the holy Church of Rome, doth minister her Masses, her Mattens & Euensong, prayers, and song, al in Latine: and some times therewith doeth mingle, Greeke and Hebrew wordes. In such sort as that, not onely the common people, but the Priestes and Bishops likewise do not vnderstand it.
               Yet will the holye Church haue it so done, yea, and puniseth such as woulde otherwise vse it, like damned heretikes. Like as out of Eckius, Piggius, Hosius,

                     Figius in libro cont. Hosius in a certeine boke which he set out of this matter onely. Then hereby of necessitie must followe, that the Church hath a full and resolute power ouer the expresse worde of God, aboue the cōmandement & ordenāce of Iesus Christ, and aboue all the scriptures of ye Prophets & Apostles. But what neede is it (I pray you) to bring so many and diuerse ensamples one by one, for the deference of this matter? Sithence we see euidently, that shee in all her deuotions, Gods seruices, and ceremonies, doth alter the expresse wordes of the Scripture: yea, doeth openly and wilfully ouertread it, euen as though it were done in spite and anger of the holy Scripture in the Bible.

besides so many traditions of idle heades, which the holy Church of Rome hath receyued for a perfite seruing of God: as fasting dayes, yeares of grace, differences and diuersities of dayes, of meates, of clothing, consecrating of Churches, of altars, of candles, pilgrimages, Letanies, Kyrieelesons, Images, Processions, holy ashes, holy Paceegges, and flanes, palmes and palme boughes, Albes, Copes, Maniples, Vestmēts, Miters, Staues, fooles hoods, Shelles, and Belles, Paxes, licking of rotten bones, carying of the Pixe about, and praying to a lumpe of doaw, fasting vpon certaine speciall dayes, creeping vpon knees before a Crosse of wood, buying of Bulles and pardons, mumbling of Pater nosters and Aue Maries, by tale, vpon a paire of Beades, before a dumbe image, shauing of crowne and beard, to giue blessing with two fingers: and ten thousande more such prankes.
               Yet, aboue al, this is by the holy Church (as it were in spite of God and his word) ordeyned, That euery man being a good Catholike, maye appoint and choose for himselfe a Saint and patrone, erect a new image, and specially build a new chappel,

and an altar, set vp a newe and particular religion, weare a peculiar or special kinde of garment, assume and take a seuerall vse of meates and ceremonies: finally, and to conclude, doe what soeuer his good meaning and intent persuadeth him vnto.
               Secondarily, it is so, that our deare mother will not set vp any seruing of God, but shee must of necessitie haue therevnto all sortes of ymages, as well carued as painted: and worship the same by kneeling and praying with burning of candles, with kissing and licking, with pilgrimages, and other such like deuotions. And in setting vp the sayde images in all high wayes, in all streetes, and in all corners, euen as for an euident token and protestation, that they neither do once thinke vpon Gods commandement set forth in the holy Scripture, neither wil be subiect or bounde to the same.
               Thirdly, all her diuine seruice,Coniuring. all her ceremonies and deuotions, and all her holinesse, is grounded in cōiuring of creatures, and worshipping the same: and in flat sorcerie and witchcraft, in working whereof they speake vnto the dumbe creatures, as though they had as much vnderstanding as

the Priests themselues, and so do abuse the blessed name of God, and the textes of the holy Scripture openlye, and without respect.
               The water is by them exorcised or coniured by these wordes:This coniuratiō you shall find worde for word in the Masse booke. 
                  I coniure thee thou creature of water: In the name of the father, the sonne, and the holy ghost, to the ende thou become a chosen water to take away all the power of the diuell, and that thou mayest driue awaye and confounde the diuell him selfe with all his wicked Angels, &c.
               
               The oyle and the balme are coniured and bewitched, with much mumbling, blowen vpon with many breathings, with three times crying, All haile holy oyle, three times, All haile holy annoyntment, and three times, All haile holy baulme, And then it is kept for a most holy thing in a fine vessell therefore made, and so caried along the streets by the Priests, with great deuotion and prayer.
               The salt is coniured in this maner: I do coniure thee thou creature of salt,
                  More coniurations. 
                  by the liuing God, by the true God, by the holy God, and by the same God, which commanded Helias to cast thee into the

water, to take away the vnwholesomnesse of the water, that thou mayest become an exorcised or coniured salt,
                  
                     Nota.
                   
                  to the saluation of the faythfull, and to worke the preseruation both of bodie and soule, to all them which shall enioy thee: and that all the subtiltie, wilinesse, and filthie intents of the Diuell: and that all wicked spirites maye flee from that place where thou art scattered and cast abrode. And then is this salt mingled with the foresayde water, to be the right purger and sanctifier of the people, wherethrough all the power and might of the diuell is withstood, & our daily sinnes therewith finely cleansed.
               Nowe, besides all this, shee doeth exorcise and coniure certeine hearbes, vpon certeine dayes, to the health both of bodie and soule, and to driue away all daungerous hurt, all diuelish bewitching, all pestilence, vnwholsomnesse, and corruption of the ayre. Shee doeth coniure and exorcise the candles, the waxe and the tallow, to the qualifying and extinguishment of thunder and lightening.
               Also she doth exorcise and coniure beads of wood, of stone, of corrall, and of all other stuffe: whereby they receyue great

power against sinne, the diuell and hel. And (which is more) shee doeth not let these thinges be thus coniured by the Pope and Priests onely, but the Pope may (whensoeuer it shall please him) giue the like power and authoritie, to whom soeuer he will, be it man or woman. This may well appeare and be perceyued of all men, by the example of a worthie matrone of Spaine called Senora Maria Osorio,
                  
                     Senora Maria Osorio.
                   who did obteyne of Pope Paule 3. licence and power, for her selfe and twelue of her bloud, to coniure and holowe such beades: and these beades were of this might, that whensoeuer any person did saye a Pater noster thervpon, although it were done without deuotion, or once thinking of the matter: yet did they thereby obteyne forgiuenesse of the thirde part of their sinnes. And for this cause were the balles of these beades made of Copper, and set in the Church, where was set out by them in print, their full might, with all their properties and nature, as is before declared: so as at this day men may openly see by the common people, which come and say their Pater nosters vpon their beades there, holding their handes vpon those balles, that thereby they may obteyne the forgiuenesse

of their sinnes.
               Nowe, ouer and aboue all this,Christning and coniuring of Belles. the Belles are not onely coniured and hallowed, but are also baptized: and haue appoynted for them Godfathers, which holde the rope (wherewith they are tyed) in their handes, and do answere and say, Amen,

                   to that which the Suffragane or Bishop doth speake or demaund of the Bell. And then they put a newe cote or garment vpon the Bell, and so coniure it, to the driuing away of all the power, craft, and subtiltie of the diuell, and to the benefite and profite of the soules of them that bee deade (specially, if they bee riche, and can pay the Sexton well:) and for many other like things. In so much that the Belles are so holy, that so long as the Church or the people are (vpon anie occasion) excommunicate, they may not be rong. Like as by Pope Bonifacius 8. and Gregorie 9. is manifestly ordeined: although yet it is (of speciall grace) permitted, to toll the Aue Maria, as Iohannes Caldarinus hathe trimlie written.
               And this (I assure you) is no small matter. For Doctour Albericus de Rosato doth declare, that the religious had amōgst

themselues at Rome, a long and weightie dissention, wherevpon great processes were mainteyned,Processes for the knolling of Aue Maria.
                   and all about this: namely, which of all the Orders shoulde first knolle the Aue Maria in the morning▪ which processes did long endure, till at the last it was concluded, and adiudged, that they which were first vp, should first knoll. Euen after the maner of kine, who alway let the formost go before, and the last followe after. Why (I praye you,) hath it not bene seene, that the Spaniardes (which are the first sweete and most deare children of the holy Church of Rome, comming nowe of late to Groninghen in Friseland, did there christen, coniure, & hallow theyr Ensignes:Christning of ensignes. naming one Barbara, another Katharine, &c. I saye nothing, howe they coniure the diuell out of yong children, which are brought to be christened: euen as though the yong children (to whome Christ doeth witnesse the kingdome of heauen to belong, and be those which with their fathers are conteyned vnder Gods promises, and made cleane by the bloud of Iesus Christ) were possessed with the Diuell.
               The Masse (I pray you) what is it, but

a plaine coniuring, sorcerie, or witchcraft▪ Wherein the breade and the wine, which are but dumbe creatures, are (by the breathing of the Priest, and the power of fiue woordes) conuerted into fleshe and bloud. So that it is most apparaunt, that all her Religion, all her diuine Seruice, and ceremonies, are full of witchcraft, sorcerie, and coniuring: full of ydolatrie, setting vppe of Images, and giuing them worshippe, full of mennes traditions, institutions, and deuises: and in conclusion, full of all that, which by the holy scripture is openly reproued, and plainely forbidden. So that (verelie) these Heretikes must needes bee verie blinde, if they doe not well perceyue, that the power, the ordinaunce, and authoritie of the holy Church of Rome, neyther can, nor will bee shutte in, nor hedged about, with the pales and walles of the holy Scripture. For, see here: this is that, which the steadfast pillar of the Theologie of Louen, Iodocus Tiletanus himselfe hath openly written:
                     Iodocus Tiletanus not contented with the Gospel.
               
               
                  We are not satisfied (sayeth he) with that which the Apostles or the Gospell doe declare: but wee saye, that as

well before as after, there are diuers matters of importance, and weight accepted and receiued,
                  In his booke written agaynst the confessiō of the preachers of Antwerpe. 
                  out of a doctrine which is no where set forth in writing. For we do blesse the water, wherewith we baptize, and the oyle, wherewith we anoynt: yea, and besides that, him that is christened. And (I praye you) out of what scripture haue we learned the same? Haue we it out of a secret and vnwritten ordinance? And further. What Scripture hath taught vs to grease with oyle? Yea, (I pray you) from whence commeth it, that wee doe dippe the childe three times in the water? Doeth it not come out of this hidden and vndisclosed doctrine, which our forefathers haue receyued closely, without any curiositie: and do obserue it still, &c?
               
               But what neede haue I to trauell much for the establishing hereof: seeing there is a generall rule in the holy Church of Rome, That the Pope maye franklye This is also specified▪

                  That the blessed woorde of God is set foorth, and is sufficient to instruct, to teache, to punishe, to amende: yea, and wholie apte, and sufficient, to make men wise ynoughe for their saluation, and to instruct them sufficientlye to all good workes. And that, who soeuer shall teach any other Gospell, than that which hee hath taught, (though hee were an Angel from heauen,) is accursed.

Yet a long time after the Apostles, yea, aboue seuen or eight hundred yeeres after theyr decease, our mother the holye Catholike Churche hath founde out a wonderful and vnspeakeable newe hoorde of wisedome and knowlege, through which a mā may come to perfite iustification, and to an angelical life: and aboue that get in store a heape of deseruings, and good woorkes, to helpe a good friende withall at a pinche: and yet to release a dozen or twaine of sillie soules out of Purgatorie.

But of this coulde hee saye nothing:

for this was too daintie a dishe for his mouth, and therefore must bee kept for the last course, agaynst the time that the holy fathers, of full perfection, and Gods deare friendes Saint Fraunces,
                  This standeth plainly in their Legends▪ and in the booke made of the might of our Ladie Rosa Crans which Alanus did make by the inspiration of Marie the Egyptian or of Egypt.
                   
                  Saint Dominicke, Saint Barnarde, and Saint Alane, (who had sucked our blessed Ladies brests, as well as Christ him selfe, and walked about the towne with her as the bridegrome with his bride) shoulde appeare. For what needes muche rehearsall of so manie euident visions, which happened to that holie woman Briget? Or of the notable miracle of the wilde Marie Aegyptian? who ranne through woodde and wildernesse, ouer hilles and dales, starke naked like a wilde beast? Or of the goodlie and pleasaunt orders of Saint Clara: the which our deare mother the holy Church hath receyued for verie precious Canticles, with great triumph. Well, goe to nowe, reade the whole Bible ouer and ouer, and I will bee bounde to giue the Theologians or diuines of Louen, a pottle of wine, to make mery withal, if thei cā find out there, that either Christ, or his Apostles, did euer knowe, that who soeuer doeth die in a Gray friers cote, shall neyther

come in Purgatorie,To die in a gray friers habite. nor in Hell. And yet notwithstanding, not onely Radulphus Agricola, Albertus Pius, the Prince of Carpi, and Pope Martinus, woulde die in such an habite, and be buried in it: but likewise, many other Kings, Dukes, Earles, and Barons: as in the booke of the conformities of Saint Francis is specified, and with the Popes Bulles established:

In hoc moriens saluabitur. That is to say, Who dies herein, shall be saued. Like as in euery place in their Churches is painted forth. Or what knewe they, that Alanus shoulde make the Rosarie of our Ladie, which must be esteemed as the Gospell? like as the good Catholike men Tarthemius and Leander haue written & witnessed.
               Well, nowe do we not plainly see, that the holy Church of Rome hath but a while agoe founde out maruellous holinesse of this newe Religion of the Iesuites, neuer heard of before:Iesuits. who haue found out a way of ful perfectiō, which neither prophet, nor

Apostle could neuer spie out before? For this was founde out first in the yeere of our Lord 1537. by a Spaniard, borne in Biskay named Don Egnatio Leguiola,
                  
                     Egnatius Leguiola.
                   who with twelue companions, whom he named to be his Apostles, went vp to Rome, and from thence to Venice, pretēding to go on fourth to Heirusalem: but finding at Venice no shipping readie, he returned backe againe to the holy citie of Rome: where as this costly treasure was then marueilously published and set abroade. Notwithstanding that, a litle while before, to wit, in the yeere 1523. one Iohn Peter Guarraffa,
                  
                     Garaffa.
                   then Bisshop of Quietta, had found out the stampe or paterne of the same: who afterwardes comming to be Pope him self, did set forth, and by his Bulles established this order of Guiettens, for the most pure order: In so much that, all those which followe this order, do farre passe all Angels in holinesse.This is specially writē in the 5. booke Sacri De

And for that he did liue a much more perfit life, than Christ

him selfe as the Decretalles do specifie.
               And yet are there but three vowes to make in the order of S. Frauncis, to witte, Obedience, Pouertie, and Chastitie. But in this newe order of Iesuiten or Guietinē, ouer and besides these three vowes, before named, they professe yet a fourth vowe, (to the ende to giue a pushe farre beyonde all other Religions) which is: That they are bounde, and shall at all times be readie, to runne and trudge from one countrie into an other, like poore pedlers and rogues, to what part soeuer it shall please the holy father the Pope of Rome to sende them: yea, although it were euen to the worldes ende: like as men may see and knowe, that they are alreadie runne to the Indians, and Pir

               Yet, besides this, the holy Church hath of late founde out another newe perfite order, whereof neither Christe nor his Apostles did euer once dreame: & it is named Pauline,
                  
                     Pauline. Gastaline.
                   or Gastaline, which was firste founde out, about the yeere of our Lorde, 1537. by a certeine Countesse of Mantua in Italie, called Ghastalia, by the good coū
                  sell and instructiō of that holy Monke, brother Baptiste of Cremona, the Preacher of

his order: Which religion doth conteine a newe way and meane, whereby a man may mortifie him selfe and his fleshly lustes: and thus it went to worke: There was an olde wife called Iulia, which would take ye yong men and maydes and (after that they had bene by making proofe and skirmishing a while,
                     Iulia causes the yong men & maidens to lie in one bed together. well trained vppe) laye them then together in a bed. And for that they should not one byte another, nor kicke backewardes with their heeles, shee did laye a Crucifixe betweene them, to keepe them asunder: and there must they set foote to foote, and striue so long, till they had wholy mortified their fleshe. And heare nowe what a miracle chaunced:
               It happened so, that there was an other old wife at Venice,
                  
                     
                        〈◊〉
                      old wife of Venice. which had a great mind to preasse and traine vp yong men to this kinde of warre: who wrought a trim feate, whereby shee did greatly strenghthen this perfect Angelical holines. For shee caused two great bookes to be made, both of equall bignes, & like fashion: wherof the one was a Bible,A subtil fashion of a Bible. and the other was hollowe wtin, as a litle chist, made in all points like a book, wt claspes & al, which she filled with

flat bottles ful of Malmesie, and with good fine Marchpanes, which she her selfe made, of the brawne of Capons and Partridges, with Sugar and Almondes (like a lickerous Ladie) and then gather into a prettie Cell, with these two bookes, and there sat prounking and tarying alone in her deuout contemplations, sometime fiue or six dayes together, praying for her Champions, and reading full deuoutly till ye bible was quite emptie: not eating or drinking anie thing else all that while. Was not that well fasted? And was not such a wonderfull miracle sufficient to establishe the strength and worthinesse of this new religion of Champions? Trueth it is, that she was at the last (when the matter was knowen) banished out of Venice: but that was not done for her holinesse, but specially, because there were a great manie of amorous letters founde about her, which were of great importance. For else (alas) what could haue bene said to her heauie and pitiful penance, whereof the like is daily done? You maye see them sometimes in Italie go alongst the streetes, with a great rope about their neckes, as if they were dropped downe frō the gallowes: and sometimes they weare a

sawsige or a swines pudding in place of a siluer or golden chayne. Is not that sufficient, to deserue heauen by?
               But, if I should go about to expresse euerie particular religion alone, which our mother the holye Church hath founde out, beside the Scriptures: I should haue work for this seuen yeres. Wherefore, it is not needefull. For all good Catholike men do knowe well ynough, that our holye fathers the Popes haue sufficient authoritie, to bring in and establish newe religions and rules of perfection, as manie as it shall please them: although it be plaine, that the whole Scriptures neuer make mention of anie such: as it is most euident, by so many diuers orders and religions, which haue bene by their holinesse set vp, brought in, & established. As, there are the orders of the Basilians, Augustinians, Benedictines,

Marie Magdalene, S. Valdrud, &c. All which haue bene receiued & established by our holy fathers the Popes, for good and holy.
               Ouer and aboue these, they haue ordeined many sundrie Heremitages & orders of Heremits, as of S. Anthonie, of S. Hilarie, of S. Makarius, S. Theon, S. Frontinian, S. Horus, S. Helenus, S. Appellomius, S. Paul the Hermit, S. Martarius, S. Piamōtius, S. Castomianus,
                  
& many more of the like rabie. Now are there more added to these, ye holy Giides or Confraternities, as The fraternities of S. Roche, of S. Hubright, of S. Sebastian, of S. Coronne,
                  Brotherhoods. which go cladde in blew: of S. Anthonie, in blacke: of S. Martin in white: of S. Dominick, in black, &c. And to the ende that the heritage should not be without Rutters or Pensionars, they haue appointed certeine newe religious orders of holy Knights likewise: such as are the knights of the Rodes, or of Malta, Dutch Knights, the Templers,
                  Knight brethren. the Knights of S. Iames, our Ladie Knights, Saint Georges knights, knights of Hierusalem, Calitrauenses, Montenienses, Gartarienses, &c. But truly, I had need of vi. hūdred tongues & two hūdred pennes, & a mouth of steele, wt an iron voice, if I should declare all the diuersities of orders & religions, which our holy fathers ye Popes haue set vp, not only without, but directly against ye holy Scripture: and yet without naming of the Popes themselues, or their Cardinals, Prelats, Archbishops, Bishops, Metropolitanes, Suffraganes, Archdeacons, Deacons, and such like strange beastes, whereof neither Prophet nor Apostle euer heard.
               
                  Nay, I dare saye, that if the Apostles had but once seene, or hearde, the hundred part of these new religious orders and professions named, they would haue bene afraide of them. For, seeing that S. Paule could not suffer, that amongst the Congregation of the Corinthians, some should call them selues the Disciples of Peter, other of Paule, the thirde of Apollo: howe would he then haue bene afraide, and out of quiet, when he should haue seene or hearde, of such an innumerable companie of newe and diuers names, professions, religions, Gods seruices, and rules of perfection: whereof some were clad and apparelled in blacke, some in white, some in gray, some in green, some in blewe, some in red, some in furres, and in all maner of diuers colours: and euerie one of them did esteeme his owne order and rules for the best, and most worthie to be regarded. He would surely haue thought him selfe to haue bene come into a newe world. Therefore it is a great follie, that men will founde them selues onely vpon that, which the Apostles haue taught or written: considering that the world is now chaunged, and that the holy Church hath found out and established newe religions,

newe commandements, and newe articles of our faith, whereof the Apostles neuer knewe. For otherwise (beleeue me) if nothing els were estemed but the bare Scriptures and writings of the Prophets and Apostles, then should all the Decrees & Decretalles, all good holy Ordinances of the Church of Rome, all the goodly Councelles which haue bene kept and holden, by the order and commandement of the Popes: yea, all the before specified orders and religion of Friers & Nōnes, the Heremites, Gildes and Knighthoods, be vtterly ouerthrowen: yea, all their merites and supererogations, would not be worth an Oaten cake, if men should begin to esteeme and accept the holy Scripture alone, for a true and sufficient rule and direction: and then should Luther haue done well, when he caused the decrees and de

                  retals to be burnt.
               
                  O, no, truely, We must aboue all mainteine those in reputation: yea, euen in greater estimation,
                  It is sinne against the holye Ghost, to do any thing against the Popes decrees. 
                  than the woorde of God it selfe: for who soeuer doth sinne against the word of God, his sinnes maye be forgiuen him: but he that doth sinne against the Decrees of the Pope, doeth sinne against the holy Ghost, and therefore

his offence shall neuer be forgiuen him.
               
               Therefore, it is vndoubtedly a great ouersight of them, that would compasse and pale in the holy Church with the bounds of the holy Scripture, seeing she may steppe or leape ouer it with a staffe, or without anie feare: and as often as euer she wil.
               Yet it is true, that sometimes shee doeth helpe her self with the scripture: for if there were no scripture, howe should one knowe whether there must be a Church or no: or wherby should a mā discerne ye true church of God from the church of Antichrist? Yet doth she alway rule the Scripture, & makes therevpon such a glosse, as best serueth her turne: yea, that is more, she is the very occasion that any beleefe or credit is giuen to the scripture: as is pleasantly set foorth by the holy and right honourable Bishoppe Guilielmus Blindasinus, in his booke called Panoplia:
                  
                     Iohannes Blindasinus
                   wherein he concludeth with strong & inuincible reasons, That mē were not bound to beleeue the word of God, nor to be subiect vnto it, if it were not, that the holy Church hath so commanded. For, what do we thinke, yt the word of God is so strōg of it selfe, as to publishe such thinges thorough

the power of the holy Ghost, if the Church of Rome did not first giue her verdicte in the matter? No marie, I warant you: for so the Heretikes do vnderstand it. For these Heretikes will bring the church of God in subiection vnder the scripture: & therefore do they alledge out of Ieremie, That the word of God is like a fire,
                     Iere. 23.29. & like a hāmer, which breaketh stones in pieces: & that it is liuely, mightie,
                     Hebr. 4.22. & sharper than a two edged sword, & goeth through euen to ye soule, & to the sinewes and ioyntes, & is a searcher of the thoughtes & intentes of the heart: and therefore (saye they) it hath no neede of any mans witnes, as Christ him self hath said: but that those which do ye will of the father,
                     Iohn 5.34. Iohn 7.19. shal lightly know (by inspiration of ye holy Ghost) whether the doctrine be of God. They say likewise, It doth giue light to al things: for it is a lampe to lighten the feete of the beleeuers: whereby they must walke through the darknesse of this world: & they say, yt mans wisdom & vnderstanding, how great, howe wise,2. Pet. 2 19. Psa. 119.1
                        •
                     3 howe holy soeuer the same can be, is plain darkenesse, in comparison thereof.
               Well then, if it be so, that the darkenesse can not lighten the light, but that the light

it selfe must lighten all things, then in very deede can not the worde of God receiue anie light of the opinion or authoritie of man: but it selfe must be the light, whereby men may knowe, which is the Church of God, and which is the Synagogue of dissemblers. And therefore they conclude according to the worde of the Prophet Esaie, That men must followe after the Lawe,
                     Esai. 8.20. and the witnesse, which is, the writtē word of God: and that whosoeuer doth not walke after that, shall neuer see the daye spring. But, as I haue alredy said, all that is plain heresie: for our dearely beloued mother the holy Church of Rome will be chiefe Iudge her selfe ouer the holye Scripture. So that the doctrine of the Prophetes & Apostles, is now no more the foūdation of ye Church, as it was in the time of Paul: but contrariwise,
                     Ephe. 2.20. the Church, with the authoritie & the traditions of the same, is the onely foundation of the Scripture. For euen so might the Iewes before time aduance themselues likewise, by the estimation & authoritie of the Church, alledging that the law and the witnes, whereof ye Prophet speakes, could haue bene of no estimation, but by reason, ye same was consented to thē by the Church:

and that men should neuer haue knowen, neither the Lawe, or the witnesse, or Gods worde, if it had not bene by them, and their forefathers set forth & declared, what they should accept for Gods worde: and that the Church with her light hadde lightened the Lawe and the witnesse. And so the Church of Rome doeth nowe also saye, That the worde of God hath no estimation, but that which it hath borrowed of the Church: for otherwise (as shee sayeth, and as all good Catholike writers do declare) howe should we knowe, that the scripture were the word of God, if it were not that the holy Church had so allowed and iudged it? Wherefore should we more beleeue the Gospel of Mathewe, or Marke, than the Gospell of Nichodemus, or Thomas? For there standes plainly written in the Decrees, That neither the old nor the newe Testament were receiued of mē, for this cause, or that cause:
                     Capitulo. Si Roman. parag. quib. ad hoc. dist. 19. nor for that it must be esteemed for an vndoubted rule and perfect knot: but only because that the holye Father Innocentius, Pope of Rome, had so iudged it, and so would haue it. Therefore yee maye well thinke, that God could not plant and establishe his holy worde in mens heartes, by

the inspiration of his spirit (as S. Iohn the Apostle would proue) if it were not that ye holy Church had therein holpen him.
                     Iohn 2, 27. So that in this case, God is greatly beholden vnto our deare mother, the holy Church, for her good wil & faithfull seruice. For if shee had accepted the Fables of Aesope, and of Howleglasse, the gospel of the Distaffe, and of Fortunatus purse: the gospel of Nichodemus, or the Alcaron of Mahomet, or els the gospel which certein Monkes at Paris, in the yere of our Lord 1220. had made, & set forth, being ful of al filthinesse and blasphemie,
                     Euangeliū aeternum at Paris. naming it, Euangelium aeternum, that is to say, An euerlasting gospel, requiring the Pope that it might be by him canonized: and so set it forth for the eternall word of God,This doth Mat Pa

And that should then haue bene the worde of God: yea, and therewith must God haue beene content. Wel, go too then, seeing that men did herein credit the writing and seale of ye church,

wherfore should they not thē giue as great credit to them in al other matters? For euen so doth the text of the foresaid decrees, argue, saying with plaine wordes: In so much as men do receiue and accept the old and newe Testamentes,
                  In the foresaid ca. Si Roman. dist. 13. 
                  because that Pope Innocentius hath ordeined & iudged: so it doth necessarily folow, that the Decretalles of the Popes of Rome, must likewise be receiued & accepted: the rather, for that Pope Leo hath likewise ordeined, That whosoeuer doth set him self against them, his sinnes shal neuer be forgiuen him, &c. It is very true, that by this argumēt it must likewise folow, that all the Iewes Caballes & Talmood, and all their dreames, must as wel be receiued, as ye fiue bookes of Moses, & the bookes of the Prophets. For it is most true, yt as we haue receiued ye new Testamēt of ye christē church, so hath ye christen church receiued ye bookes of the old Testamēt of ye 
                  Iewes Synagogue. And now, euen as our Romish church hath receiued ye writing of ye Apostles, & iudged ye same for true: so likewise hath the Iewish church iudged ye bokes of Moses & of ye prophets for true, & receiued thē for authētike. Nowe then, as men do herein beleeue, and

allowe the Iewes writings, and seale, so must wee also, (following the rule of our Doctours of Louen) beleeue ye said Iewes, in all that they say and teache: and thereby nowe shoulde our Romishe Church come short home. But we do not esteeme such cō
                  sequencies: It is but Philosophie: and the Popes of Rome are no Iewes. Therfore, that which they do and ordeine, hath an other maner of coūtenance, than that which the Iewes haue ordeined.
               Therefore must our former argument remaine fast & vnmoueable: especially considering, that the Church of Rome is fullye credited in the one: therefore must shee (of necessitie) be as wel beleeued in the other. For truely, this argument is the trimmest and finest stuffe whereof Iohn Blindasinus hath made his Panoplie, which is as muh to say, as his Ful furniture of weapons & harnesse.

(which was made by Barthol. of Pisa, & is alowed for good in ye chap. of Assis. In ye yere 1389.) is

written, That the same booke is better,Confirmites of Saint Francis better than the Gospel: yea S. Francis is set in Lucifers chaire aboue Angels. thā ye Gospell: for that Saint Francis is placed in Lucifers seat, aboue all the companies of Angels, at the vpper ende of all.
               Also there followeth out of the same, that the common sort of people may be as well instructed in the knoweledge of God, by dumbe Images, and mumming representations, as by the preaching of the Gospel: and that men must as well christen the Belles at the Font, as the children whiche are shapen after the likenesse of God, and bought by the precious bloud of Iesus Christ: that in baptising shall be vsed spittle and oyntment, as well as water: that the holy Sacrament shall bee caried about the streetes in the Procession, with Baners and Pipes, as well as it shall be taken and eaten in the Congregation of the faythfull, in remembrance of the death of the Lorde. In summe, men are as deepely bound, to do that which the holy Church, and the Popes of Rome haue dreamed, set vp, and commaunded, as that which by the expresse worde of God, and by the doctrine of the Prophetes and Apostles is specially commaunded. Yea, and (I praye you) why should it not be so? Seeing (out of the

same argument it must of necessitie be concluded) that ye word of God cannot be Gods word, but it must first by the church be therto shapen & fashioned. For note well, this word is with special wordes of our learned master Iodocus Tiletanus in writing thus.
                     Iodocus Rauesteyn Tiletanus in his book written against the cōfession of the preachers at Antwerpe, printed in Anno. 1567
               
               
                  That the worde of God alone conteyned in the holy Scriptures, of the old and the newe Testamentes, together with the three Symbols or Creedes, as of the Apostles, the Councel of Nice, & of the father Athanasius, yea and thereto ioyne the three first Councels, are not the rule & perfite knot of the truth, whereby it is apparant, that in no wise men can perfitely know, whether these be the word of God, or no, without the traditions or setting forth of the Church, which doth assure vs of al this, without any Scripture, &c.
               
               In summe, the truth can be no truth, nor the light, light: yea, God can be no God, except that the holy Church of Rome, that is to say, the holy Pope of Rome with his bishops & prelates, do consent thervnto. So yt it is no maruel, that they can of a peece of bread make a God & creator of heauen and earth. For if it were so, that they should say: that at noone day it were darke night, wee

must streight wayes beleue the same as an article of the faith, & by and by without delay, get vs to bed. For we say by a certaine cōmon prouerbe, That when all the world doeth affirme that a man (as by example Sōnius, or Blindasinus) is a swine, he must out of doubt trudge vnto the swinestie, and there eat only draffe. How much rather thē, when the holy Church, with that worthie cōpanie of Bishops, Abbats Prelates, and Cardinals (gathered together at Trent, or elswhere) do cōmand any thing, are not we bounde to receiue, beleue, & obey the same wtout any denial, & by and by to say Amen therevnto? And herein may men perceiue a great miracle, which (I do assure you) is greater by ye head thā any miracle that euer was don by the Apostles: to wit, yt the child was borne before the mother: yea, that the mother commes of the child. For it is most certein, and wel knowen, that the worde of God is the seede, whereof the Church of God doth spring & is ingendred, as the Apostle Peter witnesseth: cōsidering that the Church is nothing else but a Congregation of such,1. Pet. 1.23. as doe faithfully beleeue Gods woorde, and firmely sticke vnto the same: where thorough they are also called,

                  The Congregation of the liuing God, The pillar and staye of the truth. So that the woorde is the right mother of the Church. Well, nowe see, here goeth the holy Catholike Church of Rome before the worde of God, and his truth, which is as much to say, the childe goeth before the mother: yea, the worde can haue no might, no credite, no estimation, nor no being in the worlde, vnlesse it bee by speciall grace borrowed of her daughter the holy Church.

               Therefore, all helpes not, that they come forth with their writings, thinking thereby to outface our deare mother the holy Churche of Rome.

In summe, she doth tosse them and turne them euen as shee will: and windes them vp as short as a clewe of yarne. And wherefore should she not, I pray you? For she might

haue condemned them all for Heretikes, if she would, and in place of them haue taken in and receyued the writing and doctrine of Nicholaus, of Bion, of Apelles, Seuerus, Montanus, Sabellius, Paulus Samosatenus, Manes, Meletius, A

                  demned & banished for diuelish heretikes & false teachers. Not because that ye one had truly set forth the sincere word of God. And the other directly the contrarie: (for so she should againe submit herself vnder ye scripture:) but because it hath so pleased her.
               And therefore it is no reason, that those, to whom she hath geuen such honour, should now go about to ouercrow her holines, and force her with their writings, as though she ought to be subiect therevnto, No, no, they must stoope themselues, howe learned or godly soeuer they haue beene: and the holy Church must alway haue the authoritie and superioritie. For it is written in the decrees.

And wherfore? For that she is not subiect to the writings of the fathers, neither can her authoritie be subiect to their iudgement: but she (as wee haue saide before) is aboue the fathers, and gouerneth them, turnes and winds them as she will, & forceth them euē
                  
as she thinkes good. And whatsoeuer they haue written, must bee sifted through her si

                  e, to picke out thereof the finest flowre. For otherwise (seeing that the olde fathers do oftentimes differ amongst themselues, and other whiles write contrarie to that which they haue set downe before: and alwayes (for the most part) haue done directly agaynst the opinion and dealing of the holie Church of Rome,) howe should: yea, howe shoulde men make good cloth of such yarne, if it were not that the holy Church of Rome did giue her iudgement and sentence on their dooings, and did chewe the pappe before in her owne mouth, to put the same with more facilitie and easinesse into ours her sucking babes, as it were with a Spoone, giuing vs that which she alloweth for good, and casting the rest away which tastes not well in her mouth, into a corner. The summe of all is, that we maye not make anie foundation of our faith vpon the writings of the olde fathers, vnles they haue first bene vnder the hands of the holie Catholike Church of Rome, and be by her ouerseene, and set forth, as shall seeme good to her holinesse.
            
            
               
               The iiii. Chapter. VVherein is set foorth, that the Church of Rome is not subiect to anie Councell: but maye approue, or disanull them, according as shee shall thinke best for her ovvne benefite: And this is confirmed by many examples and profounde reasons.
               BVt nowe are there some such grosse fellowes,The Holy Church aboue all Councels. which notwithstanding they do see, that the Church is aboue the Scriptures, and aboue all the doctrine and Writinges of the olde Fathers, yet they thinke, that her power and authoritie maye be (as it were) compassed in, and paled about by the Councels: So that there should be nothing receiued for a commaundement of the church, but it must first be concluded by a Councell. And what soeuer were once there cōcluded and agreed vpon, with that, neither the church of Rome should medle, nor the Pope haue anie thing to doe. Yea, mary, these good felowes, O they come in due season: they might a great deale better haue tarried at home. For consider, seeing that all the Prophetes and Apostles, and likewise the old Fathers altogether: yea, & Iesus Christ the very Sonne and trueth of God himself, could neuer so binde nor make subiect the holy church, that she should yeeld

and submit her selfe to their writing and doctrine onely: howe doe these felowes thinke then, that the Councels should haue greater power to bring her within their parke and pases, considering that they are men which haue so often times erred: yea, and swarued cleane from the trueth? Wee know
                     •
                   well ynough, that the Councel Ariminense, Sirmiense, and Seleucense, did in the time of Constantine the great, fortifie the heresie of the Arrians, with their Decrees. The seconde Councel of Ephesus, did cleue vnto the Heretike Eutyches, and did blasphemously and confusedly mingle the two natures of Christe together. The councel of Carthago, in the time of Cyprian, which was holden before the first councel of Nicene, did conclude, That heretikes ought to be christened againe? But what needeth al this? Was not Christ him selfe iudged & cōdemned in a generall councel at Hierusalem, which was the chosen citie of God? And yt the councels haue often times erred, & may lightly erre, it appereth plainly inough, by ye witnessing of Gregorie Nazianzene,
                  Generall councel neuer came to any good ende. who was accustomed to say, That he neuer saw coūcell that tēded to a good end. Yea, do we not see, how there haue bin many coūcels, whose proceedings haue bin

flat against the doctrine & institutions set forth by our holy mother ye church: and yet would defend their doings by ye holy scripture? But what a good yere! Can ye coūcels preuaile against ye church of Rome, they hauing no power nor authoritie at all, other thā is giuē them by our holy father ye pope? How (I pray you) should yt then hang together, yt they should be placed at ye vpper end, not only aboue ye pope, but aboue the whole church? Is it not written in ye booke of the decretals,
                     Cap signifi. ffaiunt, & de electione & electi postea.
                   
                  That no coūcel can in any thing forbid the holy church, nor set any commandment ouer her: considering that all coūcels haue bin at her appointment, and receiued their power & authoritie frō her holinesse? And that in al statutes, ordinances & decrees of the coūcels, the authoritie of the Pope is excepted & exempted? See we not likewise, yt in the councel of Lateran, it was cōcluded,In the coū
                     cel of Lateran holden at Rome, an. 1519. & 20. in the end of the 2. ses. and 1. councell of Trent in the 2. decree of the 4. sessiō. & likewise in the last coūcel at Trent cōfirmed, That the Pope is aboue al coūcels, & the statute & ordināce of the coūcel of Basil (afore time made to ye cō
                  trary) was cleane taken away, & abolished: Notwithstanding, Pope Nicholas consented & was willing to the making of the same. In this behalfe, it was verie wisely

considered of the holy Fathers, assembled in the said Councel of Trent,
                  Councel of Trent.
                   whereas before they would fully conclude vpon any article, they did send all that they had determined vpon, in a sacke, or small packe to Rome, to haue of the Pope a Bull of comfirmation therevnto. For, out of that proceded a wonderful braue and pleasant melodie: because that therein our holy father the Pope did coūterfeit the personage of God the Father. And the holy councel of spiritual fathers there assembled together, were likened to the holy Ghost: so that the commō people were wont to say, that whē they sent their stuffe towards Rome, The holye ghost was shut vp in a male:The holy Ghost shut in a male. as the Poet Homer writes, that in elder dayes Aeolus the king of winds, did giue vnto his good friend Vlysses, a male, wherein al the winds were shut & packt vp together, ye Westerne wind only excepted, which he must needes occupie him selfe, to bring him home. And euen so went the matter betwene the holye ghost & the wind of ye holy fathers of Trent,
               
               And nowe, when the father and the holy Ghost were agreed in one, and that the bulles were sealed, they sent them with expedition and hast to their dearely beloued

sonnes, the Kings of Fraunce and Spaine, and required of them by a Spanishe Inquisition, to procure the saide Bulles and Decrees to be thoroughly obserued & kept in their Countries. So that the father,"Or, Tyrannicall torture. the sonne, & the holy Ghost, were all one heart and one soule: And haue iointly receiued & established all the Decrees of the said coū
                  cel. And how (I pray you) could it come to passe otherwise: considering that the Bishops and Cardinals, are created by their holy father the Pope, and haue promised, & are bounde by a strong and speciall othe, not to take vpon them, nor to conclude anie thing, without hauing first the counsell and consent of their Creator: As it is well and precisely set forth and concluded of our holy father Calixtus, writing, That it is not in any wise permitted to the Bishoppes,

Yea (saith he) as the sonne did come to fulfill the will of his Father: euen so are all Christian people bounde to followe and fulfill the will of their deare mother the Churche of Rome, whereof the Pope (without all doubte) is the heade.

               Vpon these considerations, was Iohn Hus and Hieronymus of Prage also burnt: because they would dispute by the Scriptures, vpon those matters, which the holie Fathers had in hand to reason and cōclude vpon. It is a common saying, Hee doeth wisely, that is warned by another mannes harme. And yet, notwithstanding this example of Iohn Hus, there was in the last councell of Trent, a Bishop so stout, that he presumed boldly to say, That we ought not to call the Pope, The most holie Father: but simplie, The holy Father: considering that Christ did not name his heauenly Father any otherwise, thā holy Father:
                  
                     Iohn 17. 
                  & for that the Pope can not be greater than God, whose vicar in earth he nameth him selfe to be.
               
               But if ye same Bishop had not quickly stopped his mouth, that word would haue bin a deere word to him. For they were about to haue put him straight way in a hole, where he should haue learned to know ye popes authority better. And likewise,Read hereof Pet. Pau. Ver. who was a gret while in that coūcell him selfe. had not Petrus Paul. Verge. bishop, wt other brablers, packed away betimes, they would haue played

the like parte with euerie one of them, as they did with Iohn Hus at Constance. For although hee was a Bishop: yea, and had before bene a Legate, and the Popes Deputie, yet he must haue lerned to know, that the Bishops,That is, Touch not the head: Prelates, and Cardinals, were not called thither to control and take vp with taunts their holy Father and creatour,That is, For so it pleaseth vs the Pope of Rome: much lesse to correct Magnificat, out of Paules writing: but rather simplie, Inclinato capite, to say, Placet, vnto that, which in the name of the holy fathers might be proponed to them: and then further, to helpe to keepe ye breade from moulding, like as a great while agoe, by a Poet was prophesied vppon them, saying: Nos numeri sumus, & fruges consumere nati, &c.
               
               That is so say: 
                     We are a great number,
                     And bellie gods borne:
                     Deuourers of victuals,
                     Consumers of corne.
                  
               
               Nowe, seeing that the Bishops & Prelates, haue no other voyces in the Councel, but bare woordes, accounted for syphers, to increase the heape: how much lesse shall

anie thing be permitted or graunted to the Laie men, which are not there receiued nor seene, neither in the Brew house, nor Bake house. In summe, the Councell is not called Oicomenicum, or General;Wherefore the Councell is called General. as though euerie man might come & thrust in his nose there. Wherefore then? Because it is as an image or pageant vnto vs, and as a demonstratiō or shew of a play or enterlude, which doeth represent & set out before our eyes the common & generall Church of God, which hearken fully and wholy vnto the voyce of their shepheard, namely, ye Pope of Rome: as was well noted and marked by the foresaid Cardinal Reignold Poole. And it was likewise openly set foorth, in the Bull of the said Councell of Trent, that it is, and ought to be of right, named a General or common Councel, for this occasion, because all christendome generally are bounde to holde,In the Bull De editio. of the counsels which begin thus, quum prop. and was set forth an. 1545 the 6. of Decemb. in the name of pope Paul the third. and to celebrate ye same with deuoute prayers.
               And to that ende, they are by the Pope earnestlie put in remembrance, that they goe to shrift, and fast vppon the Wednesday, Frydaye, and Saturdaye: And then on the Sunday be howseled, and go prunking in the Procession, and deale their almes:

or at the least say fiue Pater nosters, & fiue Aue Maries: by the vertue whereof, they shall receiue a sufficient pardon of all their sinnes, &c. What can they desire more? For as touching the sitting in the Chapter house, and there Sententiam subverbo placet proferre: that is, To saye Amen,
                  These are the words of the Buls of Indictiō
                   
                  and to nodde at that, which is pronounced vnto them: that is permitted only to such, as of right ought to doe it, or to whom it is graunted by special priuiledge: as chiefly to the right honourable, the brethren of the Pope, to witte, the Bishops & Archbishops, and his deare sonnes the Abbats, and other such like, as hee him selfe doeth set it foorth in the Bull Indictionis.
                  
                     Bulla Indictionis.
                   Therefore truely were the Dukes of Germanie, & the Protestantes in a wrong boxe, when they said, That it was no Free, and Generall, or Common Councell. For a sheepe with one eye, would haue marked that, that it was neither forbidden them, nor no man else in the worlde, to come to Trent, there to spende their money, to holde the Councell, and celebrate it, with hearing of Masses, with Fasting, and with the saying of fiue Pater nosters, and

fiue Aue Maries: yea, the whole pardon was as well graunted vnto them, as to anie Bishoppe or Prelate, or other that was there. But that was not the place where the muscles laye: They would gladlie haue had manie voyces in the Chapter house, and not to haue declared their meaning with that woorde (Placet) onelie: but that they might likewise haue disputed freelie, and brought in, and alledged the Scriptures of God: yea, they would haue had it flatlie graunted, that the Pope of Rome should not haue bene head and President of the Councell: but that euerie thing should bee concluded out of the woorde of God.
               But (beleeue me) the holy fathers, and the Pope, were not so foolishe: they did see more deepely into the matter. For, if they hadde once taken and put that horsse heame or collar about their neckes, then were all the fatte in the fire, and so the whole Church of Rome would not afterwardes haue bene worth the paring of a rotten apple. No, no, I warraunt you. They will take heede of that. For there is one point whiche you shall neuer wrest nor wring out of their handes, which is,

That all Councelles are lame, maymed, creeple, and blinde: yea, vtterly voyde of anie power, vnles the holy Pope of Rome be their President, directing and gouerning the same, as he thinketh good. For he is the verie eye, and the fiue wittes of the Councelles: Therefore was it in the sayde Councel of Laterane,
                  Read the Bull of the Councell of Laterane, set forth in an. 1512. in name of Pope Iul. 2. verie circumspectly concluded, That though all Cardinalles, Bishoppes, and Prelates were assembled, although they were barrelled vp together like herring: yet can they not holde anie Councell without the authoritie, will, consent and commaundement of the Pope, if they should otherwise doe, they should bee playne heretikes, and vngodly men: yea, they should be esteemed, thought, and taken as Chore, Dathan, and Abiram. The same was also before that, forespoken and cōcluded by the holy Father Pelagius 2. who did openly set forth,This is written in the book of Councels in the 2. booke and in the Decrees chap. multis den. dist. 17▪
                   
                  That all Councels, which were holden without the Popes consent, and commandement, are not to be reputed or accompted for Councels, but for Conciliables, that is to say, for Riots, and vnlawfull assemblies.
               
               And that is the same which the Popes, Marcellus, Iulius, Damasus, Gregorius, &

other mo, did likewise iointly ordeyne and determine, as is plainly to be seene in the book of Decrees, in ye 17. distinctiō:
                     Chap Imo dum, in the 17. dist.
                   where it is in like maner by the Scriptures▪ confirmed: As for exāple, out of the 81. psalme, where it is written, I haue saide, you are Goddes. Againe, What soeuer you binde in earth, that is bound in heauen, &c. And it is also established & made sure with strōg reasons: For that worshipful brother Thomas Vio, did openly declare in the said coū
                  cel of Laterane, That those which goe about to make the Pope subiect to the coū
                     cels, do euen like vnto them,
                  Looke in the fo
                        ••
                     said Councell Lateranen. in the 2. ses. 
                  that woulde make the father obedient to the childe: the head inferior to the foote: the captein seruant to his soldiers: & the shepeheard vnderling to his sheepe. So yt now, Christ is no more made any accōpt of in ye coūcels, nor his word any whit estemed: but ye pope hath al the charge & authoritie alone: he only is enseigne bearer, & he doth set al in order. And vpon that occasion it was determined, That ye coūsel of Pisa, being assembled without ye Popes cōsent, was no assemblie of Hierusalem, but of the towre of Babylō, yt is to say, A curse & confusion. In sūme, it is apparant, yt al coūcels & ordinances in ye
                  
worlde, and do nothing against the Popes might, nor against the authoritie of the Church: for she hath ouergrowen the rod: She cares neither for scriptures nor Coū
                  celles: shee hath the holy Ghost pinned on her sleeue, and may doe euen what so euer shee will.
               And therefore it is, that when soeuer the Pope doeth set forth anie Bulles, then doth he commonly adde this clause or conclusion to the same: Non obstantibus constitutionibus, & ordinationibus Apostolicis, coeterisue contrarijs quibuscunque, that is to saye: Notwithstanding all constitutions, ordinances or commandements Apostolicall, nor any other thing what soeuer, contrarie herevnto.
               
               Like as doeth specially appeare by the Bull of Pope Paule 3. set forth at the Coū
                  cell of Trent, in the yeere 1544. the 23. of Februarie. So that he will not giue to all the Apostles, to all the holy fathers, nor all the Councelles, scarse one good worde: yea, rather, he mockes, & playes bo peepe with them all, and so goes on forwards with his busines: For otherwise, if the matter were not thus handled, I would not giue a pudding, for all the power and authoritie of

the holy Church of Rome.
               
               For, to beginne withall, these Heretikes would giue her a rappe vpon the pate with the Councel of Mantua,
                  The Coū
                     cell of Mantua.
                   which was holden vnder Pope Alexander the seconde, in the tyme of the Emperour Henrie the fourth: where was concluded: That all those, which by Simonie, that is to say, by briberie or giftes had obteyned anie spirituall promotion, or office, should be depriued.
                  Simonie of the Clergie
               
               Aha, the mother of God: where can you finde, nowe a dayes, any Chaplein or beneficed man, Bishop, or Cardinall, that climbeth to that preferment, without moneie or rewardes?
               Secondarily, they would come & plague vs with the Councel of Rome,
                  Councell of Rome.
                   which was holdē in the time of the Emperour Phocas, where was ordeined irreuocably, & neuer to be called backe againe, That all such, as with anie giftes or rewardes, or other like promises, were mounted vp,
                  Simonie of Bishops 
                  to weare miters, should be banished and excommunicated. Yea marie syr, it were better that ye Councels were al at the gallowes, thā the holy church should be subiect to that order.
               Then after this might they come in, and dashe vs in the teeth, with the Councell

of Triburine,
                  
                     Triburine.
                   which did forbid any money to be takē for buryings:Burying. what a gods name, who could digest that morsel?
               And to this they would adde the Councel of Basil,
                  
                     Coū. of Basil the 21 ses.
                   where was plainely and sharpely ordeined, That 
                        •
                     he Court of Rome shall not take any money for any Dispensations, Elections, Postulations, Presentatiōs, nor any other Ecclesiastical offices, authorities, benefices, hallowings, blessings, no not for the very Pallium, or Bishops mantle: neither to be paid vnder the colour of bulles, seales, nor ānuales, by what colour or pretence soeuer they might be done. Aha, friend: What an Eclipse would that breede in the Popes purse?
               They would also come forth with ye Councel of Mentz,
                  
                     Councel of Mentz.
                   which was holden in the time of Carolus Magnus, where was ordeyned, That there should bee giuen againe, and restitution made of al the goods & lands, which by bequest, last will, or testament, had bene left to anie of the Spiritualtie, tending to anie losse or hinderance of the right heires. Goddes populorum! That were too bitter a Pill to swallowe and digest.
               Then would they assaulte vs, with the

Councell of Laterane,
                  
                     Con. of Laterane.
                   whereat by Pope Nicholas 2. and fourteene Bishops, was verie solemnly, and irreuocably concluded. That the Pope of Rome should be chosen by nomination, the whole common people assembled together, the spiritualtie, with the Colledge of Cardinalles present. And if it shoulde bee prooued, that any man should by rewardes, giftes, bribes, or any other indirect meanes, attaine to the same roome, the same should not onely be banished,
                  The Pope an
                        •
                      heretike and Apostata. 
                  but should likewise be taken for a shamelesse heretike, a backslider from Christ, and an Apostata. So that it should be lawfull to pull him out of his seat, &c. Aha, my masters, what a piece of worke were that? By that meanes they might ouerthrowe, and cleane roote out the holy Church of Rome.
               Moreouer & besides, they would proue, ye pope Eugenius was by ye councel of Basil, iudicially condemned for an horrible Heretike, and a shamelesse knaue: and was deposed from his seate, as a wicked vile villeyne, who yet notwithstanding was after, by fine handling and prettie practises of simonie, and also with force holpen againe into his seate: and of him euer since, vntill

this our time are al Bishops, Cardinals, & Popes, yea, and all priests in general, bred and sprung vp like a litter of pigges farrowed of a fruitful sow. Al which, one with an other, head & taile, should be banished, and esteemed for heretikes, & vngodly knaues, if it were so, that the Councels might beare any swinge, against the authoritie and estimation of the sea of Rome, and our mother the holy Church: but yt I assure you woulde be to feareful a matter. And therefore must we (of necessitie) conclude, That the Coū
                  cels can in no wise ouerrule ye Church, nor by their cōmandments or ordinances cōpel her to any thing, no more than a Spiders web can hold or kepe fast a Pie, or a Crow. But al Councels must be subiect to the holy Church, euen as an obedient child is subiect to his mother: yea, and they must alwayes daunse after her Pype.
               Therefore, when as these Heretikes and Huguenotes, do bring in a great heape of these Councels, to strēgthen their doctrine withal, agaynst the Romish Church, they do but breake their braines in vaine. They may well

                   that the Councell Eliberinum in Spaine, which was holden about the yeere 300. in the time of Constantine
                  
the great, did plainely ordeine, That there should bee no Images in the Churches, nor in no wise to paint,

But in all this they do but loose their labour: and it is euen as much, as if they would cut the aire in twaine: for we do not esteeme al they can say worth a rushe.
               That being done, they may bring in

apace for witnesses, the Councels Affricanum, and Mileteranum, wherin saint Augustine did set forth such stuffe, as were ynough to shame them, all praying to saints vtterly ouerthrowen: for that there was by perfect proofe and expresse Scriptures proued and concluded, That neither is, nor euer hathe beene on the earth so holie a man, (Christ onely excepted) which hath not bene spotted with sinne himselfe, and had neede continually to pray for remission and forgiuenesse of his owne sinnes. So farre doth it differ from that then, that the Saintes should haue any sparkle of deseruings remaining ouerplus.

               THis same must be vnderstoode of all the former decrees, and canons of all the Popes deceased. For although it be cleare, that they are inspirattons of the holy ghost, against which it is not lawful for any man to speake: so as whosoeuer doeth despise them, is voide of the Catholike and Apostolike beliefe: yet that notwithstanding, they cannot therefore by any meanes close or shut vp ye authoritie of the Church. And wherfore? For that there is one common rule of the holy Church set foorth, for an vndoubted article of our fayth, which is, That the Romish church is she, which doth giue to all Popes decrees, their full power and might: prouided alwayes, that she her selfe, is not in any wise subiect to ye same, by reason that she hath a ful power always to make such decrees and ordinances, when

soeuer it shall please her, as hauing power, and being heade ouer all Churches, from which poynt no man maye dissent. So, after this manner, doeth shee giue and graunt to the decrees,Popes against their owne decrees. full power and authoritie, with this exception, That she her selfe will in no wise, incline or yeelde to the same: but that she may do any thing agaynst the same, whensoeuer it shall please her. Euen like as Christ did teach the people, as hauing might, authoritie, and power of himselfe, and not like vnto the Theologians, or Phariseis, whiche durst neither put to nor diminishe or take from the same. And euen after this maner it followeth with the Popes. They giue the decrees their authoritie, and yet notwithstanding this may they do (as masters and Doctours of the lawe) euen when they list, agaynst their owne lawes and decrees▪ and therefore the decrees and Canons doe not conclude anie thing at all, without this exception, That the Churche of Rome may alway vnderstande, interprete, and expound the same, as she shal think good. And herevpon it commes to passe, that in all decrees, one of these tales is ioyned, to wit, Reseruing alway the right and title

of the Church of Rome: or, So farre forth as the Church of Rome doeth thereof allowe

                  Sosimus, Vrbanus, and Leo 4. haue concluded, That all the decrees and ordinaunces of the Pope, beeing contrarie to the olde and former decrees and Canons, shoulde bee voyde and of none effecte. And whereas Gregorie hath likewise ordeyned, That whensoeuer any Pope wil haue his Decrees obserued, then must he è contrà, obserue the decrees of the Popes his predecessours. But vpon that ye glose saith, Hoc non credo:
                  Vpon the before written chapter, const. dist. 10. which is, I doe not beleeue that. And is not that answere grounded vpon good reason? So that wee may boldely conclude, That the holie Church will not be bounde nor pend in by any Decrees. Shee is like vnto a Catte, shee can not bee forced or compelled. For else might these Heretikes, and Huguenotes choke the holie Church with her owne decrees. For they woulde bring foorth this

and being forced to play the bankrupt, should be driuē into an hospital, there to ende her sorowfull and miserable dayes.
               Therefore let euery man, which will pretende to be a good and faythfull member of the holy Church, looke well about him, that he in no maner of wise, for any thing that may be, do extoll the decrees so high, that the holy Church of Rome should be subiect vnto them: but let our holy mother alwayes remaine vnhindered, at libertie and free, that shee may freely, as touching all Decrees, Canons, writings, and ordinances, dispense, ordeine, iudge, dispose, order and reserue: and in summe, bind the diuel vpon a cushen: for she neither may nor will be constreyned in any matter: considering that shee is like vnto these olde Foxes, which can not bee taken in anie trappe: She can leape ouer all gates, and hedges, ouer all ditches & quagmires, ouer al parkes & pales, and she hath no other order nor rule, but what she thinkes good, euen her owne deuotion, her good intent, &c.

               The vi. Chapter. VVherin is concluded, out of that vvhich is aforesayd, that the benefite and profite of the Church of Rome, is the onely rule and direction of all scriptures, decrees and Councels.
               HErevpon may wee boldly conclude, and out of that which is sayde before make a most true and infallible generall rule,The holy Church of Rome the verie knot of all writings decrees & coū
                     cels. 
                  That neither the holy Scripture of the olde and newe Testaments, nor the writings and doctrine of the olde fathers, nor Councels, nor Decrees, nor any other institution or ordinance in the world, can be specially holden for the certein rule of fayth, wherevnto the Church is bounde: nor yet for the traditions and institutions of the holy Church, which all Catholike men are bound to beleeue, vpon paine of damnation. But the estimation and benefite of the holy Church of Rome, is the only principal & most sure rule & directiō whereby all Scriptures, councels, ordinances and decrees must bee guided and gouerned. Yea, it is the verie pricke, the white and the but, wh
                        •
                     reat all good Catholike christē people must shoot al their arrowes, and lay their iust leuel. Therfore, whensoeuer the holy Scripture will serue, the turne of our deare mother the Churche

of Rome, shee may accordingly vse it: and wherein so euer the Councels can doe her any seruice, she may commaunde them: and when the olde Fathers say any thing, that can further her cause, shee may allowe it and let the rest goe.
               Also, wherein soeuer the decrees may further her purpose, she may haue them in reputation, and make them equall with Gods worde. But whensoeuer the Scripture doth make against her, she may finde a glose, or an Allegorie vpon it, and so couer the matter with a blewe mantle. And when the olde Fathers write any thing, which soundes against her holines, she may thrust them out of the doores, and send them packing. And wherein soeuer she doeth mislike of the Councels, she may admit & approue other councels against them, and so driue one thunder away with another. And when soeuer the decrees tend any thing against ye maintenāce of her honorable state, she may boldly deface thē, & set an earmarke on thē, which shee calles Palea, yt is to say, Chaffe, or Strawe: or else she may sau

Then you may perceiue well ynough, that she is like the honie Bee, which wil sit vpon euery flowre, and fetch out of euerie one of them yt which serues her turne, to fill her hiue with pleasant and sweete honie: and what soeuer is not appliable or agreeing to her purpose, that she leaues vntouched. Therefore, the foundation of the holy Church of Rome may very wel be called, A Bee hiue, hauing the propertie of a tubbe, wherein al maner of pleasant things are put.

And last of all, she hath learned of Simon the sorcerer, & father of al Heretikes,
                     Act. 8.19. to giue Bishoprikes, & Benefices, Masse, Mattius, and Sacraments for money, and yet not to sell them.

So that it is very plaine & apparaunt, that shee can helpe her selfe well ynough with the doctrines and opinions of Heretikes: and sucke out of them, what shee thinkes good, to carie into her Bee hiue. Yea, shee doeth in manie things agree with the Alcaron
                  
of Mahomet, and with the Turkes religion:

Now, whether they haue borrowed that of Mahomet, or he receiued it from them, by reason he had a holy Monke, one Sergius, for an assistent & companion: I referre that to the iudgement of the Doctors of Louen. Thus much once by the waye, that it is easie to be noted, that it is all one per dominum, and all diet in one fatte: and that she is like to a cunning spinner, which can make good thred of all sortes of flaxe.
            
            
               The viii. Chapter. Declaring that the Church of Rome hath likevvise borrovved manye things of the levves, vvhich shee doeth set forth and holde as articles of the faith.
               
                  The holy Ro. church borrowes many thīgs of the Iewes.NOwe, as touching the Iewes, shee hath not forgotten to followe them sundrie wayes: and that is apparant ynough, in that which our master Gentianus hath declared in this worke. For hee will mainteine, that the Transubstantiation of the bread into the very body of Christ,

and the changing or turning of the substāce of the wine into his verie blood, maye bee proued by the testimonies of the Iewishe Rabbines. And that is without doubt: for one of their Rabbines named, Rabbi Moses Hazardan, writing vppon the 136. Psalme, where the Prophet saith, O Lord thou giuest all fleshe their foode, saieth thus: This texte doth fully and wholy agree with that which is saide in the 34. Psalme: Taste, and see howe pleasant the Lord is. For the bread or meate which he giues to euery man, is his fleshe: and with the tasting, or with the eating, it is turned into flesh Out of this hath a good Monke & a Catholike writer concluded, That this Iewish Rabbin did well vnderstand Transubstantiation:
                     Petrus Galatinus in his booke Of the Secrets of the Catholike truth. in the 6. chap. of the 10. boke which he doth yet againe cō
                  firme by another, named Rabbie Cahana, who vttereth maruelous & wōderful speculations, vpō that texte of Moses, where Iacob did promise to his sonne Iuda, an vnspeakable & vnmesurable quantitie of wine & milke, by these wordes: He shal binde his foales to the vinetree, and his asses to the noble vine branches: he shal wash his clothing in wine, & his mantle in the bloud of grapes: his teeth are whiter than milk.
                  
For out of these woordes of Iacob, doeth the foresaid Rabbi conclude, That the asse doeth here signifie Messias, into whose bodie and bloud the wine shal be changed. See nowe, is not this a strong & an inuincible foundation, against which the gates of hell can not preuayle? For that agrees euen as well together, as a fiste in Gentianus nose.
               Besides this, are established out of these Rabbines, the suburbes of hel, and by them declared, That ye holy Fathers are lodged there, against the comming of Messias. For that could the Rabbines finely fish out of that, which is written in the book of Ecclesiastes: This you shall

               Furthermore, out of the Thalmoode is proued, that Marie, our Lorde IESUS Christes mother, was conceyued without original sinne. For one of their Rabbines called Rabbi Iudas, Simons sonne, doth so speculate, saying, That the In the boke called Galirasepa, which is to say, The explaner of the hidde or secret thīgs matter wherof the mother of the Messias should bee generate, was formed before that Adam fell, and so preserued from generation to generation, without polluting. And this doth he teache out of the Psalme, wherein is written:

                     ••
                  ously well alledged, & the naile hit right on the head? Verily, it may verie well be compared with an other doctrine of theirs, where they saye, That God in the beginning did make two Whale fishes, a male and a female, and fearing least they should bring forth a monstruous generation, he killed the one, and so laid him in pickle against the comming of Messias:Reade Munster in his Hebrewe Dialogue of Messias. at which time he will kill the other likewise: and then shall the Iewes make a banket thereof, and haue noble cheare: for the one Whale fishe they shall eate freshe, and the other well powdred. And I maruell, whether they will not bid our deare mother the holy Church of Rome to their banket. But in that they may well inough beare one with another: it is inough for vs to k

are heaped vp together like a dunghill. But nowe, for that we shall not neede to rehearse euery thing particularly, it is most true, that the nation and Caballa of the Iewes is the best grounde, and the truest well spring of all the ceremonies of the holie church of Rome.

               Yea (I pray you) who is so grosse and dull of witte, that can not conceiue of him selfe, that shee hath had of the Iewes the verie example or paterne, wherby she hath made and counterfeited, so manie faire & goodly ordinances, statutes and ceremonies? Whereby shee hath workmanlie wrought all her silken, gilce, and embrodered copes, vestementes, and myters, euen as with a fine needle: & al the riche relikes, prounking iewels, altars, candlestickes, candles, and torches: and to be short, al the goodly ornaments, which you may see in the church, were made by the exāple & paterne of them. And their Sancta Sanctorū,
                  
that is to saye, The Holie of Holiest, or The most Holie place vpon earth, which she hath pacte vp at Rome, in a corner of a chappell, at S Iohn de Laterane: whereof hath she gotten that, but onely of the Iewes, in whose Temple at Hierusalem, the innermost & most secret place where God did sometimes appeare, called in their language, Roodes radaschim, that is to saye The holie of holiest? For in place of that, they had there the Arke of the promise, with the couering, called The Mercie seat, or Propitiatorium: wherein was kept a viole with Manna, and the florishing rod of Moses: which thinges our deare mother the holy church of Rome can not come by: and therefore hath she set vp another chest, with relikes in it, wherein she doeth keepe very gingerly and deuoutly, the foreskinne or Circumcision of our Lord Iesus Christ, with his slippers, and his nauell skinne, as plainly appeareth by the verses, which stand written before the same place, which are these vnder written:

For in the same text, where it is sayde, That they haue learned of the Iewes to annoynt their altars, and to trimme them with many proper things, is argumented and reasoned thus:
                     Cap. consecrat. Si qualiter ergo de consec. dist. 1. 
                  Seeing that the Iewes which did but serue in a shadowe and darke figure, did notwithstanding all those things: howe much more ought we being by dutie bound to

doe the like: to whom the verie truth is manifestly reuealed. Whereby men may plainly perceiue, that is verie lawful for the holy Church: yea, and that of duetie she ought to doe all things, whatsoeuer the Iewes haue done heretofore. So that it is no maruell, that she hath of her selfe set vp so many newe ceremonies, and sacrifices, and brought in so many Patrones & Baalims,

                   builded altars, and erected chappels in all high places and wayes: and that she doth daily kill the Prophetes, and doeth crucifie Christ again in his members. For seeing the Iewes haue done so, she is much more bounde to do it. And vpon this point is the before alledged text verie plaine and cleare, saying thus: Hereby it doeth appeare, that men may alledge and bring in good arguments and instructions vpon the examples of the Infidels. Which doth serue our purpose verie well, to the setting forth of this our purpose, considering that hereby is apparaunt, that matter which we haue in hand, to wit, that our mother the holy Church, is not subiect to anie Bible or woorde of God: and muche lesse to anie Councels or Popes decrees: but may dongue her grounde with all kinde

of dyrte, and may make her Bee hiue fatte.
            
            
               The ix. Chapter. VVherein is declared, that the holie Church of Rome hath gathered manie things of the doctrine & examples of the Heathen, which she hath conuerted and turned to her owne commoditie and profite.
               YEa, here it is plainlie to be seene,The holie Romish Church doth followe many examples of the heathen. that she doth not helpe her selfe with the Iewes onely: but likewise with all sorts of false doctrine, religion, and examples. So that it is euident, that she hath followed the steppes and Religion of the godlesse Infidels, as well Romanes as other, wheresoeuer the same might serue her turne. For out of the rounde Temple at Rome, which is called La Rotunda, which was in those dayes by the Heathen dedicated to all the Gods, and to that ende was named by a Greeke worde Pantheon: thereof hath she made (following the saide Heathen) a Temple for our Ladie, and all the Saints.All Saints in place of all heathen gods.
               
               But is were mere foolish to stand vpon one example, thereby to proue a matter, whereof all the bookes, and the whole Theologie of the Catholike men is full euen to the toppe. For the verie foundation

it self of their doctrine & diuinitie, is much more deepely grounded and built vpon the doctrine of Aristotle, than vpon any, either Prophete or Apostle: by this same token, that at this present, a Doctours hoode, or the Caputium of a Theologian or Diuine at Louen, is called Aristotles breeche or Codpeece. Yea, and moreouer, the most part of all our Scotistes, Thomistes, Albertistes, Occamistes, Realistes, Nominalistes, and other Doctours, are sprong vp, of Aristotle, of Plato, of Porphyrius, Auerroes, Abeupace, and such other like Saintes, euen as out of their head spring and principall well.
               In so much also, that the Doctours and Theologians of Colen haue very wittily conclud
                     •
                  d: That Aristotle hath bene Praecursor Dei in naturalibus, sicut Iohānes Baptista in diuinis: that is to saye, Aristotle was the forerunner of God in al things naturall, as Iohn Baptist was in thinges diuine and supernaturall. And for this cause,This doeth P. Barnardo of Luxenburgh witnes in the booke called Catalogus Haeveticorum.
                   amongst other, hath the holy Church condemned Martin Luther, for that the doctrine of Aristotle (which is the verie mother of the diuinitie of the Louanistes, Sorbonistes, and Colenars) was by him reiected,

and nothing set by. After this doth the worthie Bishop Durādus testifie,
                     Durandus in the booke called Rationale diuinorum of

                  That the holy church did learne of Nabuchodonozor, to halowe their churches, and altars, euen like as he caused his golden image to be halowed and consecrated, which he would haue all people and nations to pray vnto.
               
               So that it ought not to seeme straunge to anie man, that the Church (according to his example) doeth likewise cause Heretikes to be burnt, which will not praye to her images, considering that he caused the three yong men of the Hebrewes, Sidrach, Misach, and Abednago, to be throwen into the hoate burning ouen, because they denied to praye vnto his consecrated golden image. But what neede I to trouble my self much with these matters? The children in the streetes doe knowe well inough, that a great many of the ceremonies of the holy Church of Rome, are gathered out of the ordinances and religion of Numa Pompilius king of Rome. For the decrees,You may reade this in the boke of Decrees cap. Clericos ff. pont. dist. 21. and the booke of Sentences do very cunningly set forth, that from thence they proceede: and that, in these dayes, men call the Pope in Latin, Pontifex, because Numa

Pompilius caused his high Priestes so to be named.In the 4. booke of the Sente

Therefore this is sufficient for vs, that by this it may well bee perceiued, that she hath gathered her holines and ceremonies, as well out of the Heathen authours, as of the Iewes, & olde Heretikes, and brewed the same all together so cunningly, that it is a maruellous pleasant cup of drinke, to swallow downe without anie chewing. So that nowe wee may stoutly conclude vpon the former question, what that is for a beast, which men call Traditiones Ecclesiae, The traditions of the Church of Rome. Seeing we now well perceiue, that her foundation & ground stands not vpon the writings of the Prophetes and Apostles,
                     Ephe. 2.10. (like as Paul would in his time haue mainteined:) much lesse then vpon the Councels, Fathers, and decrees: but it is partly founded vpon the Scripture, being first well glosed and sophistically handled: partly out of the chiefest writings of the olde fathers: partly out

of the scomme of the Councels and decrees: partly out of the fine flower of olde Heretikes: partly out of the Caballa of the Iewes Rabbines: and lastly, out of the Theologie of Numa Pompilius, the Philosophie of Aristotle, and out of the examples of the Heathen.
               
                  This was euen thus concluded at the last councell of Trent, in the 3. session. where as the determination of the Church was made equall with the Scripture.Now all gathered together on a heape, and baked in a cake, are called Traditiones sanctae Romanae Ecclesiae, The traditions or commandements of the holy Church of Rome. Which vpon paine of damnation of the soule, and the body, to be burnt in fire, must of necessitie be beleued of al men, and holden in as great reputation, as the worde of God it selfe, which is written in the holie Scriptures.
               Therefore it is, that the bookes of the holy Catholike subiectes of the Church,The Indians haue in one part of the countrie a maner of garment made of the feathers of Popingates of all colours, & the more fantastical & changeable that their garment is, the more it is esteemed. as Eckius, Piggius, Hosius, Bunderius, Asotus, Ruardus Tapparde, Iohannes Latomus, Iohannes a Louanio Franciscus Sonnius, Gulielmus Blindasinus, Iodocus Rauestein a Tileto, and other more, are finely set forth and brauely decked with feathers of all colours after the Indian fashion, and trimmed vp with all costly stuffe, euen like Saint Iames wi

For as long as they holde that end fast, they can neuer loose the threede. And it is but follie to talke: the Heretikes must needes be taken in the trappe: for if by chaunce they scape out at one hole, they are by and by caught in another. After this, they brewe you a noble and pleasant drinke, iumbling the olde fathers and the newe together, the true with the false. And if they can once catche an Augustine, or an Ambrose, by

the necke, then will they after that bring in a trimme toy, of the fine letters of Clemens, and Anacletus, which a dronken Monke, and vnlearned buffell, did babble out somewhere on a Saint Martins euen, and mingle therewithall the goodly fables of one Dionysius, whom they call Areopagita, which one of the seuen sleepers haue found (I wote not where) behinde a banke: then also come they lustily foorth with a Thomas de Aquino, or a Scotus, & ioyne with him a Bricot, or a Holcot, or a Peter de Broda, to keepe him companie. And lastly, for a sawce, they bring in vpon that their Legendum Aureum, and then Dormi secure, and so make thereof a Compost, or, as it is called at Louen, a Brodium, such as the Heretikes must needes bur

And this is the inuincible Panoplia, or Stratagēma, that is, The defensible furniture & fighting weapons of warre, which the right honourable Bishop Guilielmus Blindasinus vseth. This is the Verbum nō scriptum, the vnwritten worde or veritie, which all Catholike writers doe alwayes stande vpon: this is Consuetudo sanctae Romanae Ecclesiae, that is to say, The vsage

and old custome of the holy church of Rome, whereon they boast themselues a great deale more, than anie towne doeth of their priuiledges. This is Traditiones patrum, The traditions of the fathers, of which the children do boldly boast and bragge: In summe, this is the ground and foundation of the hellish Catholike Romish beliefe, wherevpon our dearely beloued mother the holy Church doth stande so fast, as it will be verie harde for all the diuels of hell to blowe her off with all their bellowes.
            
            
               The xi. Chapter. VVhich teacheth, how that vpon this foundation, Heretikes must be examined. And what questions are to be proponed vnto them in the inquisition.
               THerefore the order and maner to dispute with Heretikes nowe adayes,The examination of Heretikes. is no more to bring in many Scriptures or Councels against them, for therein woulde they be too readie and ripe reasoners: but we must onely lay before them the good intents, ordinances, and statutes of the holie Church. And it is sufficient to prooue that, by any one of the argumentes before

specified: for whensoeuer men can alledge only one, whether it be out of the Fathers, Councels, Decrees, or out of Aristotle, or Virgil, then it is cocke on our side, and the battell is wonne. But now contrariwise, whensoeuer the Heretikes goe about to ouerthrow any article of the beliefe by the holy Church brought in and established, it is not therefore sufficient, that they proue it to be contrarie to the Scripture: for that is but one witnes. And it is a common prouerbe: Vnus testis, nullus testis, One witnes, no witnes: but they must proue it to be directly against all these before rehearsed, or else they remaine in the sacke: and by this meanes shall we (without doubt) get the victorie and vpper hande ouer all our enimies. For by this foundation are al the Lutheranes, and Huguenotes, condemned, banished, and accursed. Vpon this grounde they are deliuered ouer into the hands of temporal officers, as ranke Heretikes. Vpon this foundation are they at the last pitifully murthered & burnt. And wherfore? For this is the verie foote wherevpon men do condemne for Heretikes, all such as do not beleue al, whatsoeuer the holy church beleeueth. It skils not out of what grounde

they haue fetcht this: whether out of S. Francis vineyard, or out of the goldē Legend, & liues of the ancient Fathers, or out of the Decrees & Decretals: that is all one, so that it tend to the benefi
                     •
                  e & establishment of the holy Church of Rome. For as it is before declared, that is onelie the foundation of the holy Catholike and Romish Christen faith. Therefore whatsoeuer dependeth therevpon, must (of necessitie) be esteemed, receiued, and taken for a special article of our beliefe: and whosoeuer will not so accept it, they are damned without mercie: yea, although they had both Paul and Peter ten times for their aduocates: and ten dozen of Bibles on their side will not serue: for they shall neuer be demaunded, whether they do beleeue the Scripture and the Bible? or whether they holde the writing of Paule for the woord of God? or whether they doe not acknowledge themselues to be poore, miserable, lost, and condemned creatures, by the fall of Adam, and the children of wrath and damnation? And that God of his meere mercie and pitie (without any desertes) hath loosed and redeemed them? For all this is but brabbling, it shall not be demanded

of them, whether they do not stedfastly beleeue, that they onely (through the onely oblation of the bodie and bloud of Iesus Christ, once offered vpon the crosse) are iustified before the face and iudgement seate of God? For that is of no importance. And much lesse shall it bee demaunded of them, whether in time of their neede, they do call onely vpon the onely liuing God, through the mediation and intercession of our onely mediatour and intercessour Iesus Christ? For that is altogether Lutherall. What shall be demaunded of them then?
               
                  Howe men shall examine Heretikes.First, and before all, whether they doe not beleeue that the holy Church of Rome, is the Ladie and Queene ouer all Churches, and that the Pope of Rome is the heade of the same? And whether they doe not beleeue all, whatsoeuer this Church beleeueth? After that, if they do not beleue in the holy Masse, in Purgatorie, in the miracles of men Saints, and women Saints? Also, what they doe thinke of the holy Reliques? As for example, If they do not beleeue in the foreskinne of our Lord Iesus, which is at Antwerpe? in a second, which is at Rome: in a thirde, which is at Bezancon: in a fourth, which an Angel

brought once from Hierusalem, into the towne of Aken: and lastly; in one whiche is seene and worshipped in an Abbay at Poytears in Fraunce?
               
               Item, whether they do not beleeue in the Cribbe which is at Rome in our Ladies Church, and in our Lordes shooes, which are likewise at Rome, in the holy place called Sancta Sanctorum?

                  Gentianus, worthie to be shrined in golde, and set vpon an altar, seeing that hee hath with fewe wordes so substantially taught the very right way to bridle and bring vnder these heretikes, and to put them all in a cloake bagge: specially those which doe not beleeue whatsoeuer the Church beleeues: all such are vnbeleeuing and damned Heretikes.
            
            
               The xii Chap. VVherein is declared, that the Lutheranes are with this foundation so valiantly assalted on all sides, that it is not possible for them to escape any way: and what is the last argument to be obiected against them: is, declared and proued by the example of Transubstantiation.
               WHat maruel is it then, that a simple yong man, whom hee calleth Brother Ligier, durst not dispute against Master Gentianus? For who dare bee so bold as to looke such a stout Goliah in the face? I let alone speaking to him: no, and I would not counsell the Huguenotes to take vpon them so to do. For whereas they thinke perhaps, with a sling to hit this Giant in the forehead with the corner stone of Gods worde, and to fell him downe to the grounde: yet must they knowe, that all the matter is not ended there. For in place of

one, there will starte vp by and by, and innumerable companie of stout and valian: Champions, which will assault them on all sides. For besides all the holy fathers, the Popes of Rome, besides all the noble and right honourable Cardinals, all forkeheaded Bishops, all fatte Abbats, and proude pra

Yea, this hath bene proued by manie wonderful tokens, as you may see,The sacrament of miracles at Bruxels. and heare at Bruxels, in Saint Goels Church, where the Iewes stand painted, which did sticke the holy Sacrament there through with daggers, and the red bloud came running out.

What will these Heretikes say to this, when that Asses do beleeue it, and yet they esteeme it not? We read likewise of Saint Gregorie: howe he being busie at Masse, and hauing spoken the fiue wordes, the holy Sacrament was soudeinly (through his prayer) conuerted and turned into a fleshly and visible finger: and that for a good Gentlewomans sake, which could not well beleeue that it was fleshe. Likewise, it is written,A miracle of the fiue words. that there was a good and a deuout woman, which had heard in secret of her Curate the fiue wordes: and being with her Gossep kneeding of doaw, to make bread, she rehearsed by chaunce to her Gossep the secretes of the Masse, which she had learned of the Priest: and soudenly all the doaw was turned into flesh: and the water, wherwith she had wrought the doaw, into verie bloud: in so much that the poore women were maruellously affraide, and were so bloudie as though they had lien ten yeares in the butchers slaughter house.

Now is it not plainly written in the booke of that holy Monke Leander Alberte of Bullein, that beside the lake called Lago de Bolsena, as a Priest was saying his Masse, that holy Offertorie or oblation did droppe a great many droppes of bloud vpon the altar, and vppon the white piece of cloth called the Corporall: after this, it skipt and leapt out of the handes of the sacrifising Priest, & away it went, swiftly fleeing all about the Church like a birde, still dropping droppes of bloud vpon the Marble stones, which are seene there yet to this day.
               Men may finde a hundred thousand such like miracles set foorth in manie goodly, laudable, and praise worthie Histories, and golden Legendes, and specially in the Historie of the notable, learned, wise and discrete man Lipomani, who (I dare say) would not willingly lie, if he could hit vpon the truth. Then all these miracles, and all

the foresaid Saints, & iolly roysters, would euen ioyntly together, be vpon the bones of these heretikes. After all this, the Iewes Rabbines would march forwarde into the field, with their Caballa, & with their Thalmood, & stoutly defend our transubstantiation. The Ethnik poets (& specially Ouid) would likewise follow all a flant to help vs: for they will neuer suffer their cunning (whereby they caused their Hecate & their Iupiter, Elicius with certeine woordes in their sacrifice to come out of heauen in spite of their teeth) to be plucked frō them. And beside that, they would likewise ioyne with vs, to defend their Metamorphosis, that is, their Transubstantiation. And they would bring at their tailes, a band and noble supplie of 113. Bishops, who altogether in a Councel

                   at Rome, haue concluded, That it must be so: And that it is the verie flesh of Christ, not onely sacramentally, but the verie bodie in deede, and as they terme it, Sensualiter, that it to say, That men may feele and taste it. It is broken with handes, and with teeth torne, eaten and digested. Herevpon they haue accursed all those that doe not so beleeue. And with them should be coupled all the great,

wise, and profound Doctours, and sententious writers, to wit, Paschasius, Lācfrancus, Thomas de Aquino, Scotus, Innocentius, Comestor, Amarcanus, Gerson, Gabriel Biel, Durandus, Alexander de Ales, Occan, Petrus Hispanus, Albertus Magnus, Raimundus Lullius, Petrus Lō
                     bardus, Petrus de Aliaco, Petrus de Bella pertica, Rabanus, Panormitanus, Bricot and Halcot. And these would drawe forth with them, al the good Catholike men, that haue bene in our time. And these noble Cardinals specially would make a great stirre in the field, as Thomas Caritanus, Reginaldus Polus, Stanislaus, Hosius: and these deepe Doctours, Master Syluester Prierias, Thomas Radinus, Ambrosius Catharinus, Iacobus Hoochstratanus, Iohannes Cochleus, Iohannes Eckius, Iacobus Latomus, Magister noster de Quercu, Iohānes a Louanio▪ Iodocus Tiletanus, Ruardus Tappard ab Enchusia.
               
               In summe, all the Doctours of Paris, of Louen, of Collen: yea, all the Licentiates and Bacchelers, all these would set so stoutly on euerie side vpon these Heretikes, that they may thanke God, if they get frō them without leauing a limme behinde them:

For they would (vndoubtedly) teare them in pieces, with their teeth, and swallowe them vp whole haire and hide, euen as they do with their god: Or if it were so, that they could not well bring that to passe, by reason that the Heretikes are more heauie to digest, than their god in the Masse is, then there would come to helpe them, Maister Deane Romist, the Procurour Generall, with a great companie of Catchpolles, & hangmen, with staues and stakes, with fire and sworde, with strawe and fagottes, and would set them on fire, and so burne them vp by clusters: and then their disputing were at an end. Then also were S. Paule packt vp in a male with all his Prophets & Apostles. Would not the matter go well then with these Heretikes & Lutheranes? No, no, it is much better for them to tarie at home with their Paule, than to deliuer him againe a freshe into the handes of the Iewes. In summe, our Maister Gentianus hath great reson, that he, like a strong and inuincible Goliah, doeth so stoutly ouerbragge and outface all the whole heape of these Caluinistes, Zwinglians, and Huguenotes: yea, so couragiously, that they dare neuer be so bolde, as to come againe

that the Heretikes will mainteine, That we ought not to receiue any doctrine besides the worde of God, set foorth in the holie Scriptures. But nowe there resteth no more difficultie in this matter: for wee haue prepared for him in the former article such a pill, that he will lightly slappe it vp, considering what a wide throte he hath. For wee haue substantially and stedfastly herevpon concluded, and also pronounced sentence irreuocable, That the Scripture cannot ouerrule our deare mother the holie Church, nor bring her vnder subiection. And therefore we wil not breake our heads about this matter, but will referre & leaue it to the iudgement of our Maisters of Louen: intending now to intreate of the vnderstanding and meaning of the scripture: wherein we haue two principall pointes to set forth and determine vpon.
               
                  The first, that we declare what is the power & authoritie of the holie church, in setting forth the Scripture, and to applie it to her aduantage. The seconde, That we by plaine examples declare, and proue, that she hath finely set foorth this power and authoritie, in the establishing of all the commaundements of her doctrine,

ceremonies, and all manner of deuotions: so that she doeth not enioy in her seruice anie one thing great or small, but she knoweth finely to fetch the foundation of them out of the plaine texte of the holy scripture, & out of that to make the matter so cleare & manifest, that you may see it euen as well in the darke, as with a candle. These two pointes wee will set forth plainly before the eyes of all men, with the helpe and assistance of the sweet deare Ladie of Halle, & al the sweete hee Saints & shee Saintes at Antwerpe, being there placed vpon the hie altar: and thereto we will call for the helpe of the holie Ghost, deuoutly saying an Aue Maria. Oremus. Aue Maria, &c.
               
               
                  The first Chapter. That the holy Church of Rome onely hath power to expound and set forth the Scripture after her will, and as shee doth vnderstand it. And of the keyes and keybands which shee hath receiued to that end: and that euerie man ought to be content with her exposition.
                  NOwe, as concerning the first part, our famous Doctours and Licentiates of Louen & Paris, do ioyntly teach,This did the Catholike doctours set forth openly at VVorms, anno 1557. 
                     That the holy scripture is a dūmbe teacher, a boke of dissentiō, a dark, vncertein, doutful, & dead letter, a nose of wax, & a leaden rule.
                     
Which is as much to say,The holy scripture a booke of brabling, and a nose of waxe. that a man may pull it, bow it, winde it, and turne it which way it shall please him. And therefore they conclude thus, Ergo, the ground and letter of the Scripture is no direction or guide, but that office belongeth only to the right vnderstāding & meaning therof. Now, the interpretations of them appertein to our deare mother the holy church of Rome onely: And because she hath it in deede, euery man shall be contented with her interpretation, wi

                     bid the common sorte and Laie people, to reade the scriptures in their mother tongue. For consider this, they haue found in effect, and by experience, that the Heretikes and Huguenotes haue alwayes the Scripture in their mouth, and take vppon them to defende and iustifie by plaine and euident textes, all that they say or beleeue. And they passe not a pinne for all the hidde and profound interpretations, which the holy Church of Rome hath finely founde out, and profoundly set downe, concerning the same.
                  Nowe, that spites them out of measure:

and to saye trueth, howe can they tolerate or suffer such a thing? yea, when al is said, what mischiefe do these Heretikes meane, that they thinke them selues wiser than all the holy Fathers, the Popes of Rome? with so manie Cardinals of excellent renowme, and honourable Bishops, with such innumerable bandes of learned men of Louen and Paris? Or if so be likewise, that they doe not passe for all their Myters, Staues, Hattes, Crownes, Cowles Capes, and Liripippes: yet must they needes remember them selues, that holie Pope Pius the fourth, nowe lately dead, did in the confession of the faith, which he with the consent of the whole Councell of Trent published and set foorth, euen as a watche woorde or speciall marke, whereby men might discerne true Catholikes from false Heretikes: as in plaine and expresse wordes is written. And first: I acknowledge the holie Catholicall, Apostolicall Church of Rome, to bee the true mother of all Churches and Congregations. And after that:The Diuines of Trent.
                      
                     I beleeue the holie Scripture, according to such vnderstanding, interpretation, meaning & signification, as our mother the holie

Church hath alway allowed for good, & at this present doth allow: to whom only of right doth apperteine to giue vnto the Scripture, a right vnderstanding, sense, & interpretation. And herevpon I do promise, that I wil neuer vnderstand, nor interprete the same otherwise, than according to the interpretatiō of the Fathers. This same haue the holie fathers at Trent irreuocably concluded: cōmanding, That no man shall otherwise vnderstande, nor interpret the Scriptures, than our mother the holy church hath in times past, and doth at this present vnderstand them. Now here you haue a full decision, a setled determination, & an irreuocable sentence, vppon our question: by vertue whereof, neither delay nor appeale can follow. For you doe heare, to beginne withal, that the worde of God is not of such value or dignitie, that it is of it self worthie to be beleeued: vnlesse it be deckte and set forth with the glosses and interpretation of the holie Fathers of Rome: So that hereof is to be gathered, as all Catholike Doctours also haue written: That the Scripture and word of God is obscure, darke, variable, vncertein, vneeuen, rawe, vnfurnished, and vnhandsome:

but the glosses and interpretations of the holy father of Rome, and of the great Clerkes of Louen are cleare, lightsome, stedfast, sure, true, euen, plain, fullie furnished, and in all pointes verie handsome and sufficient. It is true, that the pretence of Christ & of his Disciples, was to vtter & declare to euerie man, their doctrine (or at least so much of it, as doeth apperteine to the saluation of man) in all plainesse, simplicitie, & trueth, without any dissimulation or darknesse. For to that end & purpose did Christ chuse simple fishers, and other plaine dealing laie people for Apostles and Euangelistes: and did therfore thanke his heauenly father, that he had reuealed his heauenly wisdome & knowledge to simple & plain mening men,
                        Mat. 11.25. & not to the sharpwitted & deeply learned philosophers of this world.
                        2. Cor. 4.2.8. 1. Cor. 1.17. and .2.1.2.3.4. Chrysostomus in the▪ 4. homilie of Lasarus.

                      In like maner also did Paule set forth his doctrine before the simple people, in al simplicitie & plainesse: yea, he gloried of his simplenesse. Wherevpon the chiefe of the old Fathers, were prouoked diligently to put the laie people in mind, that they should be diligent & readie to pervse & search the holy scriptures, & not to thinke that they did perteine onely to the learned.
                  
                  
                     And yet notwithstanding, we must now either say, that their intent and meaning was not well grounded: or else, that the chaunce is now changed. For we see, that nowe in these dayes the Scripture is hid frō the Laie people, as a thing dark, doutfull, & of no sufficient foundation: in place wherof is intruded, & thrust in the peoples hands, glosses, & interpretations, decisions, and determinations of the holie Church: so that thereby it is good to consider, that the scripture is not only darke, but also rough, vneeuen, hard, & stonie: in so much that the Catholike children of the church of Rome might lightly stumble vpon it, and breake their shinnes: or else perhaps be seduced & drawne awry from their right Catholike beleefe. But the foresaid decisions, & glosses are as eeuen,Gloses as plain as rockes. smooth & plaine, as the rockes of S. Goddardes mountaine: yea, they are the very Planers, wherwith the roughnes of the Bible scriptures is shauen off, in such sorte, that they may serue for all purposes of work, to the building vp & pulling downe of the Catholike faith. Therefore, aboue all things, we must sticke fast to their glosings, & cleaue close to their interpretations, & haue litle regard what the plaine &

cleare textes of the scripture bring with them. Now this is the first point that you haue to consider, out of the rule before specified. The second you may likewise gather out of this: That no man in the world hath power to interprete the Scripture anie otherwise than as hitherto it hath bene interpreted, by the holie Popes and Bishops, and by the Theologians & Bachelers of Louen: for else to what purpose were it, that men should bestow such cost on those same Magistri nostri, in making them pleasant bankets, to proceed Bachelers or Licentiats, if it were not that thereby they had free graunt and licence,T
                           •
                        ssing and turning of holy Scripture. to winde and writh the textes of the Scripture with so phisticall arguments, euen as they themselues thinke good? Then we may thereby well perceiue, that suche as are neither Bacchelers, Licentiates, nor Doctours, presuming of their owne wit and will to set out the Scripture, according to the letter, that is to say, after the single and profound ground of the plaine text, & so applie them to the detrimēt of the holy Romish church, are all ranke Heretikes: seeing they goe about to rob the holie Church of Rome, of her power & authoritie: which is a thing in

no wise tollerable. For it is most true, and without doubt: yea, as true as the holie Gospell of the Distaffe: as is plainely to be proued out of the bookes of all Catholike writers, That when our Lorde Iesus Christ did deliuer into the handes of the holie Church of Rome,The keyes of the kingdome of heauen. the keyes of the kingdome of Heauen, he did yet giue her beside those an other string of sixe keyes, wherewith shee might open and shutte all the Cupbordes of the Scripture, euen as it pleased her, and as shee thought good for her owne aduauntage. And when as one key will not serue, she may proue another: In summe, and for a finall conclusion, so trauell in that behalfe, that she get the locke open. Foure of these keyes, most chiefe and principall are called Imperatrices, because they will open all the lockes in the house.
                  The first is called Expositio literalis, that is,
                        Expositio literalis.
                      
                     An interpretation according to the letter: which key our mother the holie Church hath least of all occupied: but rather had left it lying a long time behinde the Chest: insomuch that it was all rustie in a maner, and cleane marred. At last the Lutherans gat it into their handes,The Lutherans haue found one key. and setting it before them as a paterne, made other

like it: insomuch that they haue opened all the lockes, and by that meanes haue brought all the secretes of the holy Church to light, and so haue of their owne priuate motion and accorde taken vpon them, to alledge the scripture to their furtherance, and to the holy church of Rome her hinderance: so that she hath now quite lost that key.
                  The other key is called Expositio moralis, That is,
                        Expositio moralis.
                      
                     A legall or morall interpretation: or, An interpretation according to the Law: with which key they haue locked vp fast all the Chestes and treasures of mercifull iustification through beliefe in Iesus Christ: and in place thereof, haue vnlocked & set open the maledictions, cursses, and threatnings of the law of Moses.
                  
                  The thirde is called Expositio Tropologica, or Allegorica, that is to say,
                        Expositio allegorica.
                      
                     An hidde and allegoricall vnderstanding or interpretation, with which key, they lightly wreste all the Scriptures, that the Heretikes can bring in against them: for that therewith they finde out straight way, some figure or allegorie, wherewith they deck & set out the matter finely, & so couer it with a course carpet. And further likewise wt this key she hath brought abrode the most

part of the Scripture, wherewith she hath fortified and made strong all her Catholike ceremonies, beautifull prunkings, & pleasant ordinaunces, as by proceeding from piece to piece we will declare.
                  The fourth key is verie like vnto this, but it is of more strength, and is called Expositio Anagogica,
                     
                        Expositio, Anagogica.
                      that is to say, An interpretation which drawes the Scripture by the necke, euen whither a man will: and it is the best and most beneficiall key, that the Church doth occupie for her aduantage: for with this key she makes of the Scripture a Weathercocke,The scripture made a weathercocke, and a nose of waxe. which turnes about with euerie winde: and a nose of waxe, which shee can bow euerie way: as by the examples hereafter set forth you shal plainly perceiue.
                  Now hath she besides these, two other keyes, which are not right Imperatrices, but do serue particularly, either of them to his owne seuerall locke: whereof the one is called Typica, and the other Physica, that is to say,
                        Typica. Physica.
                      figuratiue and naturall. For these two keyes shee doth vse most in the Scholes and Cloysters: and therewith she fetcheth (out of a corner) wonderfull sharpe witted Ppilosophies, & deepe speculations

wherewith she mountes aloft so hie into the aire, that shee neither toucheth h
                        •

And with these, she hath (for the most part) opened all the Almeries of the Caballa, & Thalmood of the Iewes, and out of them fetched all sorts of delicate meates and daintie iunckets, as (without doubt) there were wonderfull iestes and straunge mysteries shut vp in them.
                  All these same keyes (except the first,The fiue keyes are

braiding of snarles and buttons, as well of Louen as of Paris, haue gone about, with all the wit they had, to vndo them, to the ende they might vse the keyes as they would: but they could neuer bring it to passe. For the holie Church of Rome, doubting least the Heretikes might yet catche from her anie more keyes, as they did once, causeth more newe knottes and buttons daily to bee made to them: yea, and giueth the maisters of that science great wages. For he that can best braide and make them vp, hee gettes for his rewarde a Doctours hood, or a fat Prebend: and sometimes a Bishops miter, or a Cardinals hatte: so that it is a great ouersight of these Huguenotes, and Lutherans, that they thinke to make all thinges cleare, with their one key, and will with that onelie expounde the Scripture, all care and regarde of the other keyes put by and neglected. Yea, they make no accounte at all of this Keybande: but will vnderstande euerie thing as they are learned by the letter, none otherwise than they are sette foorth in the Scripture: rightly and agreeably to the sinceritie of the faith:1. Cor. 3.6. and according to the iudgement

of Paule. Where yet notwithstanding is plainly written by the said Paule, That the letter doeth kill, but the spirite quickeneth. Neuerthelesse it is true, that they bring in this testimonie of Paule against vs, saying, That Paule did there, by the letter, vnderstande nothing else but the Lawe, and the curssings of the Lawe: and by the Spirite, nothing else, but that by the mercie of God, we are quickened and made aliue through faith in Iesus Christ, which is in the Gospel by Paul and by all other faithfull ministers of the worde (plainely and without anie obscure and darke meaning, or hidde allegorie) set forth, and preached openly before all men, as Paule him selfe doeth giue plainely to vnderstande, saying,2. Cor. 3.6. 
                     That hee was made able to bee a Minister of the new Testament, not of the Letter, but of the Spirite: and that the ministration of Moses was a ministration, of death and of the Letter: but his ministration was a speciall ministration of life and of the Spirite. But wee care not for all this. For the holie Churche will haue it to bee vnderstoode otherwise: as to say, That by the Letter is to bee vnderstoode,

the speciall, bare, and plaine text of the Scripture, euen as it doeth sounde in the naturall ground and setting forth literally vnderstoode, according to the sinceritie of our beliefe: and as by the Lutherans and Huguenotes it is alledged against vs. For this letter doeth kill, as you may well see,The letter 
                           〈…〉

                        . that those which will so vnderstand and sette forth the Scripture, are killed. But The spirit, that is to say, The ghostly, hid, and sharp witted interpretation, which our louing mother the holy Church hath made vpon it, (let it bee allegoricall, or anagogicall, or what it will,) this is onelie that which makes mightie and liuing: because this alone both agree with the iudgement of the holy Church of Rome. And all they which doe truely follow her, those are permitted to liue in all libertie and wealth: yea, although they do not beleue that there is a God. Therefore, whosoeuer will not accept this interpretation of the holie church, and vnderstand the scripture ghostly or spiritually as the Catholikes doe vnderstande and interprete the same, he is a damned Heretike, and his processe is at an ende, although he had all the textes of the scripture verie plaine, & the whole volume

of the Bible on his side: for the textes can not helpe him without the glasses, hee is but a dead man: yea, though he had an hundred liues lying in a Chest: especially, if he come once in the handes of the holie Inquisition, hee must abie for it: it is but lost labour to talke further thereof.
                  And for this cause I doe maruell, that our good master Gentian, will breake his head about this matter: namely to proue, That the Scripture alone is not sufficient for our mother the holie Church, as though that matter were not plaine and euident inough, sithence we may daily both see and feele it. And yet notwithstanding commes he out here with his profounde speculation, in such sort as he hath almost therein forgotten himselfe. I cannot iudge otherwise, but that the vnmeasurable zeale which hee beares to the welfare of his deare mother the holy Church, must haue perforce tumbled him topsie

doth say, That the doctrine of the holy Trinitie,
                        Gentian doth blaspheme the Trinitie. cannot be proued by the Scripture: that is farre too grosse. Otherwise, wee must condemne the foure first Councels of falshoode, who did by approbation conclude vpon the same out of the holie Scriptures, verie strongly, and with vndoubted testimonies of truth: yea, and if we could as well defend the Masse with plaine textes of the Scripture, as the blessed Trinitie may thereby be confirme

But the Huguenots say plainly, that they will not make anie brabbling about these wordes, but will simply followe the true ground, meaning, & substance of the Scripture. Now it is plainly wri

                     to wit, the father, the worde, and the holie ghost: & that these three are al one. There is likewise written, That there is but one Baptisme, and one God: and yet notwithstanding, we are cōmanded that we shall be baptised, In the name of the father, & of

the sonne, and of the holie ghost. So that it is apparant, that the doctrine or approbation of the Trinitie, was not sowed out of the Popes thumbe, as purgatorie & the holie Masse were, but are plainly alledged in the scripture after the letter. The like is to be said touching the two sacramēts of Baptisme, & of the Supper of the Lord. For although this worde Sacrament is not found in the scripture: yet the substance, the being, and the ground of the doctrine is (without exception) cōcluded out of the scripture, according to the letter & plaine wordes of the text.
                        Gen. 17.10.11.13. Exo. 12 13.27. Rom. 4.11. Col. 2.11.12. For the Circumcision and the Pascall lambe, are openly called, The promises of God, and doe signifie the promises of God left in liuely remembrance of his mercie, & to the cōfirming of our iustificatiō by faith. And now doth Paul teach,1. Cor. 21.25.26. that Circumcision is signified in Baptisme: and that the sacrament of the Lords supper is likewise appointed by Christ, in remembrance of his death & passion. Whervpon it is called The new promise in the bloud of Christ,
                     1. Cor. 7.5. and ministred in place of the Pascall lamb. Insomuch that heretikes (out of that) do teach, That baptisme, & the supper of our Lord, are onely sacraments, that is, holy tokens

of Gods promises, made in the bloud and passion of Iesus Christ.Confirming of more value than baptisme. Which we cannot say of that holy oyle, nor of their holy confirmation, and other Sacraments which our deare mother the holie Church hath instituted of great deuotion, and ioyned them to the two first for an help or assistance: yea, and the same likewise established and defended, That Confirmation by her instituted,

                     is much more worthie than baptisme, which Christ himselfe cōmanded: And why? Forsooth because it cannot be ministred or executed by any simple or common Priest, as baptisme may: but only by a Suffragane or Bishop, and that it makes one ful christned, and doth giue the holy ghost more plentifully & effectually, than baptism doth, which was instituted by Christ. As in her decrees and booke of Sentences is in plaine wordes written.
                  Now, besides all this, the heretikes doe also say, That wee are not able to alledge or bring out of the holie Scripture, so much as one worde, which speakes of the Masse, nor of annoynting of priests, nor of their sinne offrings, of their priests office, of their pardons, & Popes bulles, no nor of

the Pope himselfe, nor of the praying to Saints, & images of our Ladie, nor al those saints, which do so many goodly miracles, nor of their purgatorie, nor of their auricular confession, nor of their whorish chastitie of Priests, Monks, & Nonnes. In summe, they will say, it is nothing else, but mens inuentions, and deuises of diuels, which the priests haue called to remēbrance, to bring in monie by heapes, and to pamper their panches with daintie dishes: but is not this a spiteful matter? And yet our master Gentian letteth that slippe vntouched, where he should haue proued, That all these pointes, are aswell concluded out of the scripture, as the twelue articles of the faith. He saith in deed, that Ieremie had said before,
                        Ierem. 31.33. 
                     That the new lawe of the Gospell should bee written in mens hearts: whereby we will conclude, that men ought not to seeke them in the scripture, but in the head and heart of the Pope of Rome, & of his holy Prelates: for that the Pope hath all lawes, both of God & man, shut vp in his bosome & breast, as hereafter shalbe declared more at large. But this serues to no purpose against the Heretikes: for they are so lustie, that they would make M. Gentian ashamed hereof,

if he had anie shame in his bodie. Which I do not iudge of anie such great doctor, who hath long ago put off his shamefast shooes, and laid them aside: nay

And that did Paul openly witnes, That he had neither forgotten nor kept secret anie thing, of that, which might serue to saluation: but that he hath vttered & truly set forth all the same before the Congregations ioyntly together. Insomuch that he, before the holy Pope, which came afterwards, should not haue left one iot behinde. Wherevpon should follow, that the law of the Gospel, which the Pope doth carie in his bosome, is altogether of an other Gospell, much differing frō the law of that Gospel which Paul did preach, or whereof Ieremie did speake: & then should the Pope be accurssed, by the saying of Paule to the Galathians:
                        Gal. 1.8.9. 
                     Whosoeuer doth preach any other Gospell than that which I haue preached vnto you▪ let him be accurssed:

yea, although hee were an Angel out of heauen. But yet the Pope of Rome doeth not thinke, that this doth touch him: for that he is something greater than an Angel of heauen, as we shall giue you to vnderstand in due time & fit place. Now, that which he brings forth out of Iohn, to wit, that Christ said▪ 
                     That the Apostles could not yet vnderstand all,

                     & that the holy ghost should descend and instruct them further: is somewhat more apparant. But yet for all this, he is neuer the neare. For he cannot with this stop the mouthes of Heretikes, by reason that they wil stil obiect & say, that this was spoken before the Apostles had receiued the holy ghost: but after they had receiued him, then did they put al the instructions which they had learned of the holie ghost, in writing, to the end that through that which is written, all men might bee saued, by faith in Iesus Christ (as by the said Iohn is precisely written) wtout this addition,
                        Iohn. 20.31. that they shoulde haue neede to watch anie longer after the Popes Buls, or Masses of Requiem. But it is euen as I haue told you, our master Gentian hath bene so wildely prickt forwarde with that zealous spirite, that hee did not see well what

he said. For he is a man that hath whole drifattes full of wit: marie the bottoms are out. And therfore will we helpe him againe out of his dreame, omitting all such vnprofitable tittle tattle, and purposing for the second part of this matter which we haue in hand to teach, That whatsoeuer our mother the holy Church hath brought to light, studied, inuented, or found out, since the Apostles time, is altogether so surely & substantially grounded, timbred, bricked & walled vpon the plaine text of the holy scripture, (so farre as they be spiritually vnderstood, according to the interpretation of our mother the holy Church) that it were not possible to erect any castle or tower more surely vpon the highest sandhill in all Hollande. And this (I assure you) will bee a goodly peece of woorke, whereby I shall deserue muche, and bee partaker of a great manie goodly pardons and indulgencies: and shal besides that become verie necessarie and seruiceable to the comforting of our sorrowfull mother the holie Church, and to the extirpation and rooting out of all erronious opinions of newely vpstart Sectaries and Heretikes, whiche doe yet thinke, that they haue

the Scripture on their side. But they will haue but foolishe countenances, when they shall see, that the whole Scripture, with the interpretations of the holie Fathers, doeth at the least close vp as well with our doctrine, as a ring in a Swines snowt.

                     which shall be broken for you: Do this in remembrance of me. Do you wel perceiue nowe (yee poore Heretikes) that Christ doeth here commande to singe Masse? for that same worde, Doe this, is iust as much as if he had saide, Offer my bodie in the Masse to God my Father, for the liuing and for the dead. And that is first stronglie

set forth by the Poet Virgil, who saieth thus: Cum faciam vitula, that is to say, When I shall doe it with a calfe. Looke nowe by this worde Doe, he vnderstandeth nothing else, but onelie To do or offer a sacrifice and sonneoffring: Ergo, it must needes folowe, That Christ did vnderstand it no otherwise, than the worshipful Catholike Doctours of Louen & Paris haue very well declared, and irreuocablie concluded. For our deare mother the holy church hath receiued, approued, & strongly established their doctrine, institution, and prescript for an article of our faith.
                  So that it appeares, that the Masse is verie ancient, seeing it was vsed in Virgils time:Masse vsed in Virgils time. sauing onely that they did offer either Calues fleshe, or Oxe flesh: whereas nowe our Priestes doe celebrate their Masse with mans fleshe and bloud. And herevpon you may note further, that these short and sweete wordes, (Doe this is remembrance of me) hath a wonderful emphasis or force: For out of the grounde of the same hath the holie Catholike Church of Rome fished, That the Apostles were Priests or Prelates with shorne crownes, and did sing Masse: and thereof it is,

that all our Priestes are created. For, Doe this, is as much to say in their language, as, Become Priestes: and see that your fingers bee annoynted, with holie oyle, that you may deuoutly say Masse.
                  
                  And for this hath the holie Church of Rome commaunded, That none of the La

                     e people shall receiue the Chalice, because our Lorde did not here speake to anie of the Laie or common people, as the Apostle Saint Paule did in his time, when hee willed the whole Congregation and Church of the Corinthians, to doe as Christ Iesus had done. But the Apostle Paule did meane simplie, and onelie those, which were able to sing the holie Masse, as our Priestes and Prelates are, who onelie ought and may drinke out of the Chalice: as you may more perfectly and plainlie perceiue, by the writers vpon the booke of Sentences, and by all the before named Doctours of Louen, of Paris, and of Colen.
                  
                  Moreouer and besides this, wee can stronglie confirme the Masse offering, out of the Prophete Malachie, who (in the 1. Chapter, and 11. verse) saith thus:

For that can not faile, so long as it pleaseth our mother the holy Church to haue (and will haue it) thus vnderstoode. And although it be so, that Peter hath otherwise interpreted it, saying, That all faithfull are that holy Priesthood, to offer vp spiritual offrings, wherwith God is pleased, through Iesus Christ: yea, they are the chosen generation, the kingly Priesthoode, & the holie and elect people, to set foorth the worthines of him,

                        •
                      the Apostle had so saide to the Iewes,

                     That we should offer vp vnto God the offring of thankesgiuing, which is the fruites of our lippes and tongues: yet notwithstanding,

the holie Church is not therewith satisfied, because greate disorder might followe: for that then there shoulde be no mo priests which could serue in the Masse: & therfore she hath strongly concluded, that this place of the prophesie of Malachie, may not any otherwise be vnderstood, than by the second councell of Nice, the councell of Constance, the councell of Trent: & further, as by al Catholike men, as Thomas de Aquino, Scotus, Durandus, and by all the Doctours of Louen, it hath bene vnderstoode, & interpreted. Iudging without doubt, that all these profounde learned Doctours, together on a cluster, as hauing greater measure of wisedome and learning than the rest, did vnderstande Malachie farre better than Peter and Iohn, who were but simple fishers,In the .4. booke of Sentences in the .24. dist. cap. 1. and had neuer bene Studentes in the famous and renowmed Vniuersitie of Louen. And yet, if it were so, that Peter were not content, yet hath the holie Church giuen him to vnderstand, that his foresaide reason must bee vnderstoode & meant of the Priests only: and not of the generall congregation of Christ.
                  Moreouer, and beside all this, these wordes of Paule, where he saith,
                        Roma. 10.12. 
                     That we

should deliuer or offer vp our bodies, a liuing, holie, and an acceptable sacrifice vnto God, which is our dutiefull seruing of God, &c. hath she violently & forceably wresled to the Masse, and the offering of the Priestes: cōmanding, that those words should do dailie read in the Canon of the Masse▪ & that at euerie word, a crosse should be made, to the ende that they, by the power and vertue of the crosse, might altogether transforme and change their naturall vsages, and so serue the turne of the holie Masse. For, if men will vnderstande them, according to their nature, after the letter: to wit, That all perfite Christians must offer vp to God, their bodies, in all holinesse, by that it should seeme, that Paul hath otherwise vnderstoode Malachie, than the holie Church doth vnderstande him. And then should S. Peter haue done euill, when he soung his first Masse at Rome, vpon the altar, which is yet there to bee seene in the holie place at Saint Iohns de Laterane. And nowe our Lord hath saide, Oraui pro te Petre, ne deficeret sides tua▪ O Peter, I haue prayed for thee, that thy faith shuld not faile: So that Peter then can not haue done amisse, when he did sing Masse. And

herevpon is to be concluded, that the Masse is founded & grounded vpon the scripture.
                  And yet we see further, That in the scripture there are two sortes of Priesthoodes spoken of:In the foresaid Councell of Senon, decree II and in the Emperours Interim and in summa fidei Ch

Nowe, both these two orders seeme to haue bene a figure of our Priestes. Which doth appeare by this: That our Priestes haue in their Masse (by vertue of the fiue wordes) changed the bread into the bodie of Iesus Christ: then they go and offer him vp to God the Father: praying and beseeching him, that he (with a mercifull and pleasant countenance) will beholde the offring vp of his onely begotten and liuing Sonne Christ Iesus: and that he will accept the same, euen as hee accepted Abels offring,

                     and the sacrifice of Abraham, & of the hie Priest Melchisedech. Who will nowe cast in any more doubts, whether they be the right Priests, placed in the roomes & seates of Melchisedech & Aaron? Nay, they do far passe both Melchisedech & Aaron: seeing that they do pray for the Sonne of God him selfe, & are a meane, not only betweene God and man:

but also betweene God the Father, and Christ Iesus his Sonne, which in an Euangelical degree, they do resemble to the sheepe and the lambes. So that by this it is apparant, that the meaning of our mother the holie church, is, That Christ is to be accounted for nothing els, but the sheepe which Melchisedech did offer vp: Contrariwise, the Priestes are the true Melchisedechs, which do offer vp Christ, & pray for him. For when all is said, what other thing did Melchisedech (I pray you) foreshewe, but onelie the figure of the holie Pope of Rome? who is the chiefe Priest, the Summus Pontifex,

Then must he needes be the right Melchisedech, whose Priesthoode is not to bee resembled to other priestes. For this is set forth in the Decretalles, euen thus in plaine wordes: & Durandus hath set out the same at large, in his booke called Rationale diuinorū officiorū. Therefore, that which the Apostle would say to the Hebrewes,

                     That as Melchisedech was a figure of Christ: And

accordingly,
                        Hebr. 8.4. and 9.25.26.27. & 10.1.2.12.13.14.15.16.17. as Melchisedech hath neither had anie successour nor lieftenant, that euen so Christ had neither successour nor lieftenant, but should him selfe in his owne person exercise his euerlasting Priesthood, being once entred into that heauenlie holinesse, through the power of that one offering, to witte, his owne bodie and bloud: which offering being once fully accomplished for the remission of our sinnes, can neuer be renewed nor done againe. But all this doeth not serue the purpose, touching out matter: for if that were true, then the Masse would be nothing worth, and our Priestes might go with emptie stomachs, and in the end be glad to get them into some hospitall for a refuge, or at least to gette their liuing with painfull labour: which would be a pitifull case, considering that they haue neuer bene vsed to anie labour, but simplie to say Masse, sing Euensong, and to mumble ouer their Mattens, and therewith to deserue first a liuing here on earth, and afterwardes heauen for themselues, their pretie wenches, and their yong bastardes. Therefore doeth our mother the holie Church conclude, that the Apostle, in his Epistle to the Hebrewes,

did not well consider the pith and ground of the matter: for otherwise, if he had well knowen, howe that Melchisedech had offered vp bread and wine, he would then without doubt therevpon haue concluded with the Church of Rome, That there must bee Priests to sing Masse, and to offer vp Iesus Christ in fourme of bread and wine, vnto God the Father. For if this were not (as the Doctours of Louen doe teache) then could not the offering of Christ Iesus endure and last for euer,Looke on the foresaid Councell Sinonense, in the 11. decree, in the Emperours In

                        r vp his bodie to the Father in the Masse. after the order of Melchisedech: as our Maister Gentianus hath verie wittilie here noted. Consider (I pray you) if Christ had no Vicar nor Liefetenant, as the saide Apostle pretendes, how could he be an euerlasting Priest, and continue his Priesthoode euermore, in the person of the most holy Pope of Rome? Howe could he offer vp his bodie a newe dailie in the Masse? Therefore, hee may thanke the Priestes greatly, that they, after his departure hence, haue taken vppon them his place. And for so much as his offering could not of it selfe sufficiently serue the turne: therefore haue they founde out another sonne offering of the Masse, whereby they applie or ioyne his offering to men

as with a plaister: notwithstanding, they doe not name it onelie Sacrificium propitiatorium, that is, A sacrifice of mercie: but also, Sacrificium applicatorium,
                     Heb. 7 8.9.10. Chapters. that is, An offring plaistered, or put to. Was not that a great ouersight of our Lorde, that he had suffered such paines, and yet al his suffering could not haue helped vs, if the Priestes would not haue giuen vs that same addition by their Masse offering?Peruse thoroughly the chap. 7.24. and 27. cap. 8.4. & cap. 9 25.26.27.28. and ca. 10.1.2.12.13 14.15.16. &c. Therefore must the Apostle needes haue bene much ouerseene in his Epistle to the Hebrewes, when hee tooke vppon him so earnestly to prooue, that Christ had no neede of anie Deputie, and that his sacrifice or oblation could not bee renewed nor offered againe: but that it is giuen to vs, & made ours through faith: or perhaps hee was so busily occupied with the Hebrewes & Iewes, that he did not once thinke vpon our holie Masse, no nor had not the leasure to reade ouer the bookes of the Catholike Doctours of Louen, nor the ordinances of the holie fathers of Rome. For if hee had read those, he should haue lerned something else: as speciallie, that the principal point of the priesthoode of Melchisedech, did rest in the bread and wine which hee set before

                     Abraham and his Souldiers, to stake their hunger and thirst. For of this bread, and of this wine, hath our deare mother the holie Church of Rome made a sacrifice: and out of that concluded, that the Priestes must likewise haue bread and wine to chaunge the same into fleshe and bloud, and so to offer it vp. But the Apostle had neuer heard anie such newes: and therfore he is to be borne withall: but these Heretikes, who haue read ouer all these things, with our Doctours: yea, they haue it at their fingers ends: and yet they make but a mocke at it: those felowes truelie, are worthie to be looked at vnder the browes, and to haue their heades set betwixt two eares.
                  Proceeding now, as touching the order of Aaron,
                        Aarons Priesthoode, dist. 21. cap. 1. in lib. 7. dist. 14 cap. 8. In the 2. chap. of Councell. he (without doubte) was a figure likewise, not of Christ, but of our Priestes. For there is written in the Decrees, and in the booke of Sentences, That as well the hie Priestes, as the Pater noster priestes, were all ordeined by Moses, when as he, by the commaundement of God, did institute Aaron an high Priest, and did annoint his sonnes vnder priests. The councel of Aken, or Aquisgrain, hath also plainlie

concluded out of Isidore: That the order of Priestes haue their beginning of Aarons children:

                     and that those which in the old Testament were called offring Priestes, are the verie same which nowe are called Masse priests. And those which at that time were called Hie priestes, are nowe our Bishops. So that it is easie to be noted,
                     The Priestes of Caiphas race. 
                     that they are all of Caiphas his progenie.
                  
                  For as touching that, which the Apostle doeth say to the Hebrewes:Hebr 7.11. and 8.7. 
                     That by the comming of Christ, the order of Leuie was cleane taken awaye: that can not be true: considering that yet at this day, the holie Church hath her Leuites: as out of the 7. Chapter of the said Councell,This appeares also in the boke of Sentences, dist. 24. cap. 1. and out of the 2. Chapter of the 21. Distinction doeth plainlie appeare: where it is saide, That the Leuites are in Greeke called Diaconi, and in Latin Ministri. And now these must needes bee our Deacons. And therefore in the third Councell of Bracaren, it was concluded in the 5. Chapter of the saide Councell: That onelie the Leuites,
                     Leuites are Deacons and pardoners. 
                     and not the Priestes, might be pardoners, and carrie about with them on their shoulders, the reliques of Saint Anthonies

swine, and such other like, hauing on their Albe, which is to witte, a long shirt aboue vpon their coates, as was permitted to the Leuites only, in the olde testament, to carie or driue the Ark of the promise.
                  
                  Is not this a sufficient proofe? you are welcome home.Dist. 21. ca. 1. And likewise, that the other Priestes are also come out of the order of Leui, doth sufficiently appeare out of that which is before rehearsed.
                  Therefore is the Apostle much ouerseene in his Epistle to the Hebrewes, where hee will take vpon him, to mainteine, that the order and succession of the Leuites should be wholy taken away and adnihilated, or at least, he must be thus vnderstoode, as that the order of Leui is not taken away, anie otherwise, but that in place of the Iewish Leuites are entred in the Priestes & Pardoners: & in place of their sacrifices, is the Masse crept in. For consider, that which he doth write in his 5. and 8. Chapter,Heb. 5.1.8. concerning the Leuite priestes, saying, That euerie hie Priest is ordeined to offer gifts & sacrifices: pretending thereby to proue, that then Christ must also haue something to offer: that the holie Church of Rome

                           m. and other Catholike writers. as though the Apostle would haue saide flatlie, That the Romish Priestes are ordeined to offer giftes and sacrifices. And for that cause the catholike Doctours haue that text continually in their mouth, for the verifying of their Priesthoode. So that it is euident, that the Leuitical Priestes are risen vp againe in our Priestes. And although the Heretikes do mocke at al such allegations, saying, that that text is directly against vs, because the Apostle wil thereby proue,Heb. 8.4. that by the offering and Priesthoode of Christ Iesus, all other offerings and Priesthoods are taken away and adnihilated, considering that Christ could not be a Priest, so farre as there were anie other Priest that did represent & patronize him: yea, and although he were now here on earth, we passe not for that. For we will by and by bring out against them the plaine texte of the decrees, out of the Councell called, Sexta Synodus, where it is said, That Iames, the brother of Christ, after the flesh:

In summe, let it be as it wil, it is all one. Once we cōclude hereby, that the Masse was ordeined by Iames the apostle. And it is to be thought, that Iames had learned it of Clement pope of Rome,These letters are written word for worde in the beginning of the first booke of councels. who had written two pleasant letters vnto him, wherein he doth specially treat of the seat of the B. of Rome: and that Peter through his desertes or merites, was become the foundation of the Church: and so forth declares at large, how the Masse shall be deuoutly done, what apparell, what hallowing, and what other necessaries shall be vsed in the doing of it, in what clothes the Sacrament shall be laid, that it may bee kept cleane from Mouse dongue, and that no wormes nor mothes come at it: as in the first part of the councels, in the second letter of Clement, is by expresse wordes specified. Whereby may be noted, what great and heauie troubles

this good Clement had, and what maner of Prophet he was, considering that hee set out in writing, all the ceremonies of the holie Church, which were not founde yet in 700. or 800. yeares after Clements time. And therefore it is, that our deare mother the holy Church doth make so high an holiday of these decretall letters of Clement, and of other his companions, that she h
                        •
                     th out of the same established a great manie of her ordinances and holy ceremonies. In summe, it is plaine and euident, that the holie Masse hath her ground and foundation without the Scripture.
               
               
                  The .iii. Chapter. That the name and Ceremonies of the Masse are fished out of the holie Scripture.

                     onish schole at Paris, did (out of that, that is alway written at the end of all the Epistles which Saint Paule hath

written, from whence they were sent, sounding in the Latine tongue, Missa est,
                     
                        Missa est.
                      
                     &c.) conclude, saying, That Paule did thereby giue to vnderstande, whither men should goe to heare high Masse on the Sunday.
                  
                  And nowe besides this, there was a Magister noster, which said, that the Apostle Andrew had a Masse booke, and had spoken of the Masse: for Iohn reherseth that Andrew said to Peter his brother,
                        Iohn. 1.42. 
                     That he had found the Messias, or the annointed Christ, of whom Moses doth beare witnesse. And this soundes in the cōmon translation in Latin thus, Inuenimus Messiam quod dicitur Christus: which wordes this wise doctour did expounde thus,
                        Mossias is Missa.
                      
                     We haue founde out the Masse which Christ hath done. Is not that well hit? God helpe vs. Who dare now from henceforth be so stout, as to say, That the Masse standeth not in the scripture? But now, bycause that these Heretikes will needes be so nosewise, & wil vnderstand all languages: insomuch that they do mocke hereat, saying,
                        Petrus Lombard. in the 4. booke of Sentences, dist. 13. chap. 1 & dist. 24. cap. 3 that Messias doth not signifie a Masse▪
                      but The Messias, that is to say, The annointed: Now Peter Lombard, the writer of the sentences doth

set downe another opinion and iudgement, saying: That this name Missa, is as much to say, as Sending: & is so named, for that at all times there is an Angel sent out of heauen, to consecrate the Corpus domini, that is, The Lordes bodie, by whom the Priest doth send his consecrated God forwardes towardes heauen, at such time as he hath vsed these wordes following in the Masse: Omnipotens Deus, iube haec perferri per manus sancti Angeli tui, in sublime altare tuum, &c. that is to say: O almightie God commande that this may by the handes of thy holie Angel, be caried vp to thy high holy altar, &c.
                  
                  And out of this he doth further conclude, that whersoeuer that Angel doth not come, it cannot be said that there is a Masse. But truely this must be but meere dalliance, for if that were true, that they must tarie for the Angel, there woulde not be one Masse to be founde in the whole world: where notwithstanding there are Masses soung daily by heapes. And therfore hath our deare mother the holy church driuen in another naile here, and concluded in the Councell of Senona,
                     
                        Missa is an Hebrew worde, and vncerteine what. that Missa is an Hebrewe worde: now, what it doth signifie is vncertein. For,

notwithstanding that the same Councell saith, that it betokeneth a cleane offering: yet doth not that well agree with the Hebrewe tongue, vnlesse it were so that it were named Nisset.
                           Missa after the Hebrew is Nisset.
                         But it appeares much rather, to haue come of Massah, which in the Hebrewe doeth signifie Heauinesse, or Curssing: or else of an other Massah,
                     
                        Missa of Massah

                     which is interpreted, Seeking: bycause the Priestes doe with fiue wordes seeke God, to see if hee will come into the bread. Euen as the children of Israel did seeke God in the wildernesse Raphidim,

                  And so forth, concerning all such Ceremonies

as are vsed in the Masse: you may (touching these) read the booke of Durandus, or of Innocentius, de officio Missae, or the booke of Guido de monte Rocherii, called Encheiridion Sacerdotum, that is to say▪ 
                     the manuel of Priests. For there you you shall finde plainly set forth, that all the partes of the Masse are finely founded and established vpon the scripture. And to begin withall,At what houre Masse must be saide. you shall find the times appointed for the Masse, that it must be done at three of the clocke: because it is written, that the Iewes did at three of the clock crie, Crucifie him, crucifie him: or at sixe of the clock: for that at sixe of the clocke they did crucifie him: or at nine, because that then he gaue vp the ghost. For although it be so, that the Iewes at that time did reckon their houres otherwise than we do now: so that three of the clocke was with them, as viii. or ix. of the clock before noone, is with vs: and their sixe, as our xii. at noone: and their ix, as our three, at after noone: yet notwithstanding, our deare mother the holie Church doth not g

                     After this now as touching the apparel, and other consecrated or hallowed stuffe,Albe▪
                      you shall finde her Albe, or long white garment in the Scripture, specially where it is written: But he that continueth to the end shall bee saued.
                     
                        Mat. 10.12.24.13. For that long garment doth signifie long lasting, or long continuance. Concerning the girdle, where it is written: He that feareth God, shall prepare his heart,
                     
                        Eccle. 2.20. 
                     &c. By the girdle which doth tucke vp the clothes, is ment the feare of God. Item, the Maniples are fetched out of that saying, in the Psalme: Those that sowe with tears,
                     
                        Psal. 126.5.6. 
                     shall reape with ioy, and bring home their sheaues with gladnesse, &c. For the sheaues are called in the Latine tongue Manipuli, so that Dauid did there speake of the Priests maniples. And the stole which they haue about their neckes, commes out of the saying of Paule: Beare in your bodies the dying of our Lord Iesus Christ,

And to be plaine, there is not anie thing, great or small, but they are able to bring in Scripture for it: as wee can lightly proue by the foresaid Authours, if neede were. But wee had rather, that those that long for such meate, shoulde goe to the Market themselues, and buy that they like best, and let it bee dressed at the Tauerne, or Tippling house, according to their owne di

                  The .iiii. Chapter. Teaching that the transubstantiation of chaunging of the bread into the verie bodie of Christ, and the wine into his bloud, is grounded vpon the Scripture, after the interpretation of the Church of Rome.
                  
                     The transubstantiation anno 1168. confirmed for an article of our beliefe.NOw, as touching transubstantiation, that is to say, the plaine chaunging of the bread into the verie bodie of Christ, notwithstanding the same was by the holie father Pope Innocentius 3. first set forth for an article of our beliefe, about the yere of our Lord 1198. as by the Decretals is apparant: yet haue we plaine proofes therof in the Scripture. For first, Christ in the sixt Chap. of Iohn saieth thus:
                        
                           〈◊〉
                         6.55. 
                     My flesh is verie meat, and my bloud is verie drinke: that is to say (after the interpretation of our deare mother the holie Church) My flesh is truely, sensibly, and bodily taken and eaten, vnder the accident of the

bread: and my bloud is certeinly receiued and dronken vnder the accident of the wine.
                     The explanation of the Sacrament. For although Christ indeede doe otherwise interpret it, teaching that this eating and drinking, is to be vnderstoode, of comming to him, and of beleuing in him:
                        Iohn. 6.35. 
                     I am (saieth he) the liuely bread: Whosoeuer cōmeth to me, shall not hunger, and whosoeuer doth beleeue in me, shall neuer be athirst. Againe, It is the spirite that quickeneth, the fleshe profiteth nothing: The wordes which I speake vnto you are spirite and life. Yet all this notwithstanding, so long as the holie Church of Rome will haue it to be vnderstoode of her transubstantiation, as Syluester Prierias high Steward of the palace of Rome, hath specially noted in his golden Rosarie, wherein hee hath gathered all the pleasant Roses and floures of the Catholike interpreters together vpon one heape: and considering that the holy Church cannot erre: Christ must haue patience, & transubstantiation must take place. But we haue yet a much clearer text, to witte, where Christ himselfe saieth: This is my bodie: for by those wordes doeth the holie Church of Rome plainely vnderstand, that the same

which before was breade, is nowe no more breade, although Paule woulde call it breade a thousande times: but is chaunged into the verie bodie of Iesus Christ, as long, and as broade, as it was hanging vpon the Crosse. And for that cause it is, that shee doeth disallowe all the expositions and interpretations, which Basilius, Tertullianus, Theodoretus, Augustinus, and other holie Fathers haue sette foorth vpon the same: saying, That those woordes must bee figuratiuely and sacramentally vnderstoode, as Christ himselfe hath plainely saide: I am the vine: or, as Paule saieth: The stone was Christ: and as GOD spake to Abraham, saying: This is my promise, Cut off the fore skinne, &c. Which is as muche to say, that the breade shoulde not chaunge his nature, nor the verie bodie of Christ bee there present, but onelie that it shoulde bee a true and holie token, a Sacrament, a warrant and pledge, a Seale and assuraunce, whereby wee are assured and fullie certified, that hee hath giuen vppe his bodie and bloud for our saluation. And for this cause doe they call it, a figure, or token, and in the

Greeke Typus, and Antitypa, that is to say, Speciall tokens. But I doe tell you, that the holie Church of Rome will not allowe anie such interpretations: vnlesse it were so, that men woulde vnderstand them as Damascenus doeth interprete them, and as was in the seconde Councell of Nice concluded by the Fathers: to witte, That the breade shoulde bee such a seale, pledge, figure, and holie token, onely before it be consecrated: which is to say, It should be a Sacrament, before it is become a Sacrament.
                  For, that this is their conceite and meaning, it is apparaunt out of this, That long before the breade and the wine bee consecrated, or made a holie Sacrament: they doe offer vppe the same vnto God, for remission of sinnes, as well of the liuing, as of the dead.The Canon of the Masse. For in the Canon of the Masse: yea, before the bread bee turned into fleshe, or the fiue holy wordes of consecration be heard, the Priest doeth pray, That God will accept that offering of breade,
                     Looke in the Masse booke in the Canon of the Masse. 
                     and through that deliuer him from eternall death: And then, That hee will blesse the saide offering of breade in all pointes, and make the

same, holie, profitable meate, and acceptable: That is, may become the bodie and bloud of Iesus Christ. Yea, and before hee hath yet put the wine into the Chalice, immediately after the Offertorie, he saith thus:
                  
                     The prayer of the priest at the eleuation and consecration of the Offertorie.
                     O holie Father, almightie and euerlasting God, take and receiue this vnspotted sacrifice, which thine vnworthie seruaunt doeth offer vppe vnto thee for my sinnes, and innumerable misdeedes, for my forgetfulnesse and vnthankefulnesse: yea, and for all these which are here present, and for all faithfull Christians, as well those that be liuing, as those that be dead, that it may bee acceptable, auailable, and effectuall vnto the saluation both of me, and of them, vnto eternall life, Amen.
                  
                  And in one of the secretes which is commonly read vpon the 24. Sunday after Trinitie Sunday, he saith thus:
                  
                     O Lord, take and receiue mercifully this offering,
                     Another praier to the same effect. 
                     through which thou art pleased, contented, and pacified, and hast receiued vs againe vnto saluation, through the almightinesse and vnspeakablenesse of thy mercie, &c.
                  
                  
                     Consider now, here doeth our deare mother the holie Church, ascribe vnto this bread, all things which may be attributed vnto our Lorde Iesus Christ, the onely begotten sonne of God: as to say, That God is become mercifull to vs, for the bread sake, and hath pardoned vs our sinnes: and that before the bread bee consecrated, or in anie point transubstantiated or changed. What maruell is it then, that they doe make a God of it, after the fiue wordes be spoken ouer it, and yet make a Sacrament of it, before it can be a Sacrament? For as they can of a peece of breade make God himselfe, and of nothing create something: wherfore should not they likewise be able to make of no Sacrament a Sacrament: and of a Sacrament, no Sacrament? That is to say, that a simple peece of bread shoulde bee a holie token and seale of the bloud of Iesus Christ, euen before it bee made holie and consecrated. And then Econtra, that the Sacrament of the bodie of Christ, shall bee no more either a Sacrament, or token, but euen the verie bodie of Christ it selfe? So that the holie Fathers must needes haue vnderstoode it so, especially, when they say that

this Sacrament is but a token, a seale, and a pledge, specialy before it is become a Sacrament. For after that it is once a Sacrament, then (no remedie) our deare mothers will is, that it shall bee fleshe and bloud, and not anie longer neither bread nor wine, to signifie the fleshe and the bloud. And therefore doeth she not make anie account of the exposition of Christ Iesus himselfe, who (after he had saide of the bread) This is my bodie: and afterward of the Chalice of Cuppe: This is the new Testament in my bloud: thereby declaring, that those words, This is my bodie, must be so vnderstoode, as if hee had saide:
                        Luke, 22.20. 1. Cor. 11.25. 
                     This breade is the new promise in my bodie, which shall bee broken for you. For of that shoulde followe, that the breade, after the consecration, and likewise after the speaking of the fiue wordes, should still remaine breade, and so bee but simplie a Sacrament, and true token of the bodie of Iesus Christ: as shewing vnto vs the promise of God, made in the breaking of the bodie, and shedding of the bloud of Christ Iesus our Sauiour, as was saide of the Circumcision: This is my couenant which I doe make with you, to witte, for that

the Circumcision is a sure and holie promise, a pledge, and seale, through which the promise of God is verie stronglie and substantiallie made vnto the faithfull. No, no, I assure you: that liketh the holie Church of Rome nothing at all. She will lay fast holde vpon the first wordes of Christ, and not seek after anie exposition or glosse, how necessarie soeuer they bee. And for that cause shall Paule go without anie Audiuit, when he commeth in with his interpretation, and saith, That the bread which we do breake, is the communion of the bodie of Christ. For thereby it should also seeme, that it remaineth bread still after the consecration: and that it is not the bodie it self, but a remembrance of the bodie▪ which thing the holie Church in no wise admitteth nor alloweth, for life nor death. But especiallie, she will not accept nor like of the interpretation following, wherein Paule proceeding doeth declare, how and wherefore the bread is the communion of the bodie of Christ, saying, For al we which eate of one bread, become one bodie.
                  
                  Nowe truelie, that soundeth not well: for we do not al becom one bodie in substance, as the holie Church will haue the bread become

the verie body of Christ in substance. But then the similitude, which after that he introduceth or bringeth in, is to farre out of the way. For hee saieth, That those which feede of the altar, are partakers of the altar: and that those that offer vp to idols, are partakers with the diuell. And so making a comparison of the table of the Lord, and the table of the diuell: as though the Priestes could not eate vp that bodie of Christ otherwise, than as idolaters eate vp the diuels: and as though these wordes, Eate that bodie of Christ, did signifie nothing else, but this, through the power of the holie Ghost to be made one bodie ioyntlie with the bodie of Christ, as the vngodly idolaters, by power of the wicked spirite are vnited with the diuell: That is to heynous an heresie: and therefore wee may not stande vpon this similitude: for it soundeth di
                        •
                     ectlie against our Transubstantiation.
                  But when you will haue a substantiall similitude, you must search and seeke it out of Scotus, and Thomas de Aquino, or Panormitanus, and such like. For they bring in for this purpose, a goodlie similitude of a Tauerne, or common Inne,

where they sell wine: For as there is commonlie a potte, a garlande,
                     The Sacrament compared to a wine Tauerne. 
                     or Iuie bush hanged out, betokening that to be a Tauerne: and the Tauerne doeth signifie, that there is wine plentie: So likewise you see here the outward accidentes of bread, to witte, the roundnesse and the whitenesse, which doe signifie, that vnder the same is conteined the verie bodie of Christ, which is to bee resembled to the Tauerne. And this bodie of Christ doeth further signifie the holie Church of Rome, which is made one with the bodie of Christ, which they call Mysticum corpus Christi, that is to say, The spiritual or mystical bodie of Christ: and this is that sweete wine which the Priestes drinke in that Inne or Tauerne. And after this they doe likewise bring for a similitude, the water which in Cana of Galilie was plainlie turned into wine: which similitude doeth so wonderfull well serue for this purpose, as to set a fift wheele in a wagon. But it is pitie that the Priestes haue not other fiue wordes, whereby they might do that too. For then should the similitude serue their turne much better, if that they might (when they woulde)

conuerte and turne the water into good wine: for that they might therewith the better scoure and refresh their drie throtes, when they are become verie hoarse with singing of their seruice. And it is verie true, that they doe what they can for that purpose: for on Saturday, being Easter eeuen, they praye vnto God, that hee will also do so much as to turne their Beere, saying,This is the verie praier of the priest ouer the Beere, from worde to word, as it standeth in the Masse, & as Munst. saith 
                     O Lord, holie Father, almightie and eternal God, which hast made both heauen and earth, wherein the water is conteined: I pray thee, and instantly beseech thee, in the name of Iesus Christ thy onlie begotten Sonne, that thou (of thy goodnesse) wilt blesse and make holie this Beere, as thou diddest blesse the dinner of Abraham and Isaak: and as thou diddest blesse the sixe pottes in Cana of Galilie, which were chaunged from water into good wine: euen so change (for thy seruantes sake, which do beleeue in the Catholike faith) this substance of Beere into pleasantnesse and mirth,The changing of the Beere. thorough the same, &c.
                  
                  But alas, what can all this helpe, when it will not so come to passe? For they haue not this cunning: and therefore they must

needes haue bene deceiued, and so drinke vp the bloud vppon rawe fleshe. For men may say all what they will, and Paule: yea, Christ him selfe, may bring forth what interpretation they list, but the holy church will stande to the first wordes, This is my. bodie: and vpon that will she liue and die The texte is plaine ynough for her, shee hath no neede, either of glosse, or interpretation. And therefore vnto all the interpretations which these Heretikes bring in, whether it be out of the Scriptures, or out of the auncient Fathers, wee will answere, This is my bodie: and sticke as sure to that, as the Cuckoe to her song.

The text is cleare, and needes no glosse: yea, they cleaue as close to Transubstantiation, as claye to the cart wheele. Although they can not tell which way to frame this plaine text. For to begin withal, they all flatly flie from that which was concluded in the foresaid Councell of Rome, that is, That the verie bodie of Christ shuld be Sensualiter, that is to say, Sensiblie, and visiblie eaten, and with the teeth chewed in morsels. For to that they all affirme flatlie, No: and that it is a false lie, notwithstanding it is set out in the Decrees verie substantially. For (say they) the bodie of Christ can no more bee bitten, eaten, nor digested: he can not now die nor suffer anie more, nor bee broken in pieces: he doth liue eternally. Which is apparant by this token, that yeerelie vpon Corpus Christi day, our deare mother the

                        He wastes not though digested.
                     
                  
                  
                     Nowe see here, thus do they deface their owne Councels and Decrees, and make al the holie Fathers of the Councel of Rome liers. After this, come in Scotus and Innocentius the fourth, and they will defend (a Gods name) That it consisteth not in the fiue wordes, to hang the vell about the cattes necke: but that it is much rather done through the benediction or blessing that goeth before. So as the Transubstantiation and verie changing doeth not proceede through these wordes, Hoc est corpus meum, This is my bodie: but through the benediction or blessing which went before.

The other are earnestlie against this.

                         in the 9. boke ca. 5 Nowe Armacanus verie willing to please both parties, saieth, that they both haue reason, namelie, That our Lorde should not haue spoken the

trueth, and yet that it should be euen so as he had spoken and said. Occam in his Quodlibet questions, hath found out wonderfull sharpewittie testimonies and authorities, which a blinde man should hardlie haue sene without a paire of spectacles: for he saith, That when Christ said: This is my bodie, he ment then to speake the same of his bodie: yet notwithstanding vpon certeine exceptions & conditions, to wit, That the Priest which should vtter and speake such wordes after him, as soone as he had said the first pretie word (This) should then immediatlie vpon a sodeine thinke vpon two things at once: the first, This is my bodie, which now at this present shalbe secretly hid vnder the substance of bread, shall become mine owne bodie hereafter: the seconde, This bodie which is nowe hid vnder the substance of bread, that is my bodie, euen now at this present time. And this onely should proue true, after he had thought vpon these two propositions both at one instant. And it seemeth, that Armacanus was also of the same opinion. Petrus de Aliaco, hauing first verie subtilie pratled of the matter, doth notwithstāding yet at last

fall out of the cart, and findeth faulte with the opinion of Scotus, grounding him selfe fast vppon this pointe and purpose, That the fiue wordes are those which make the sporte, and transubstantiateth or turneth the bread.
                  
                  
                     Alas (saith hee) it is a sentence which is not true,
                     The explanation of Petrus de Aliaco.
                      
                     and yet notwithstanding it is no lie: but is neither fishe nor fleshe. In summe, it is as much to say, as, Giue the Doues drinke.

                     Thomas de Aquino saith, That our Lord, by that first worde, Hoc, This, did not teache anie thing certeinlie: but meant to say simplie & in a grosse maner thus: That which is here vnder the substāce of bred, let it be what it can, it is my bodie. And whereas some will withstand this, saying, That the same is nothing else, but bread, till such time as it be transubstantiated or chaunged, vnto that hee answereth, Not so. For this sentence (saieth hee) is not fullie concluded, till the last syllable, to witte, Vm, be pronounced.
                     
                        Vm, the last syllable of these fiue words, Hoc est corpus me

                      And therefore no iudgement can be geuen of the veritie or falsitie, till such time as the fiue woordes be fullie pronounced. For then is the matter first cleare, and the bread perfectlie chaunged

into the bodie of Christ.
                  
                     Richardus de sancto Amore saieth,In his booke of the Trinitie. 
                     That these wordes, This is my bodie, is iust as much as to say thus, The thing, whereinto this bread and wine shall bee chaunged, is my bodie. Other againe will saie, that Christ did not by this worde Hoc, This, meane the bread: but simplie, the accidentes or qualities of the bread, to witte, The whitenesse, The thicknesse, & The roundnesse: and that these words, This is my bodie, is as much to say, as, My bodie is here hidde vnder the accidentes or qualities of the bread.
                  
                  The holie Bishop Durandus is of another opinion, namelie,
                        Durandus, reade the 16. chap. of the second part 
                     That Iesus Christ did once consecrate, by his secret power, which is hidde and vnkowen vnto vs, and not by power of these woordes. But yet should hee (notwithstanding) after that haue set foorth by the fiue wordes, the fourme and manner that men should vse to plaie this parte of Transubstantiation after him. In so much that the Priestes should nowe consecrate by an other power and vertue, than Christ Iesus did.
                  Contrarie to this, Comestor is of opiniō,

                     That Christ consecrated with the same words, but that he did first whisper them out secretlie betweene the teeth, and so changed the bread into his bodie, & the wine into his bloud, which being done, he spake the same wordes alowde to his Apostles.
                  
                  Nowe let see what good Beere you can brewe of this, and ioyne al these wise heads together, to trie which of them is the wisest of all, and who hath shotte downe the Popingaie. Truelie, for my parte, I beleeue neuer a one of them all. For the Catholike Doctours of our time, haue bene forced nowe againe a freshe to fetch out of a corner, other newe, and vengeance wise fetches and strange trickes wherewith to mainteine the matter and make it good against these Heretikes: and yet are not at this present agreed amongst them selues: neither can they tell wherevpon to settle & ground them selues.Bishop Gardiner of VVinche

                      For that good Gardiner (a Goliah amongst the Catholikes) did set forth a great booke vppon this matter, & hath found out manie quickwittie resons, saying, That our Lorde, when hee spake these woordes▪ did meane a thing which is not to be found: and he doeth

name it, Indiuiduum vagum, that is to say, A litle incomprehensible winde, or moth, which flieth hence awaye in the aire. In summe, it is euen as much as a litle nothing, hanging by a small silke thred. And then hee saieth further, That this worde, Hoc, must bee vnderstoode of such an Indiuiduum vagum, or flying moth.
                  
                  I beleeue verelie, that hee hath drawne this out of Democritus well, who saieth, That trueth lay buried in a deepe hole: and so in the meane space doth teache for a veritie, That there are manie litle wauering things, alwayes shaking and flying in the aire, which he doeth call in Greeke Atomi, signifying Indiuiduum, or Insecabile in Latin. And out of these flying or wild vesekens shuld the world, by operatiō of it selfe, be made and brought together. Which fantasie that good man Epicurus, and all Epicuristes haue likewise followed, and stoutlie defended. And euen so will our Gardiner likewise mainteine, That this holie breadgod should bee made of an Indiuiduum vagum,
                     Gods bread made of an Indiuiduum vagum or wild veseken and that Christ knewe well to speake of that matter: although the Bakers might verie well

protest against that, and say, That they haue made it of good wheate meale: yea, of the finest wheate flower with dogges grease, and not of a wild veseken, which is no where to be found. But Iohannes de Louanio, that woorthie and profounde learned Magister noster,
                     
                        Iohannes de Louanio.
                      who hath so long caried the wisedome of Louen in his head, that in the ende his braine did waxe feeble, and he starke madde, that man in his booke which hee did write vppon this matter, saieth, That herein chaunced a great miracle, to witte, that the bread is no more bread: but that there doeth remaine onelie the qualities of the bread hanging in the aire, without grounde or bottome, as if a Cow should hang vpon a cherie tree: and that yet likewise there remaines amongst these qualities a perfect substance of bread: so that it is still bread, and yet notwithstanding it is no bread.
                  In summe, you shall finde as manie peares as plummes. Yea, is no: and No is yea. Chickens eate haie, and with them horse turdes and good sweete figges are all one.
                  There are manie both hie and lowe speculations, amongest our Doctours, who

yet trauell continuallie (like Asses) to vndo this knotte, and yet can not bring it to passe: For the deeper they wade in the matter, the more they are wrapped and entangled therein. For they perceiue verie well, that it will not come to anie good perfection, so that the bread should become the verie bodie of Christ: for that then it must needes followe, That the bread died for vs, and that a dead and liuelesse creature should be our God and Sauiour: and yet would they verie faine bring the matter to passe, so that they would seeme to sticke to the word of God: and yet for all that, mainteine and vpholde their Transubstantiation also. They do well consider, that they can not iustifie the wordes, vnlesse they do expound them sacramentallie, and figuratiuelie, as the Heretikes doe, who make no great matter of vengeance wittie questions. But our Doctours and faithfull Catholikes wil neuer come to that baite, they will rather spend both hide and haire, than they will recant & giue ouer their opinion: yea, it were also an eternal slaunder for our deare mother the holy church, and a meane wherby she shuld susteine to great damage. For Transubstantiation is the verie best

fisheponde and shambles that belongeth to her kitchen: and therefore will shee defende that with tooth and naile, and in no wise suffer it to bee plucked out of her handes. Wherefore it is no maruell, that our Doctours had rather inuent newe miracles one vpon another, and make newe and straunge glosses neuer hearde of before: yea, turne all topsie turuie, neither touching the heauen, nor the earth, and brall and chide one against another like whoores, knaues, and cutpurses, than they would consent and agree to doe such a spitefull displeasure to their entirelie beloued mother the holy Church of Rome, as to ioyne with the Heretikes, her mortall enimies, to fetch out of Paule, or out of the old Fathers, a sacramentall exposition, and thereby to doe iniurie to the worthie Transubstantiation. They are yet besides this, in great difference & dissention about manie questions depending vpō the same matter:These questions you shall haue in the wri

this roundnesse, and this colour remaine hanging in the aire without anie prop, or that they are cleane consumed, or where they remaine? Item, when the offertorie or Oste is broken, what is there broken, whether the accidents and substance of the breade, or the verie bodie of Christ it selfe? Item, whether this transubstantiated body is so quickly gone,Whether a rat or a mouse do eate the bodie of Christ. when there commeth a Mouse or a Ratte to gnawe vpon it, or when Mothes or wormes do breede in it? Thereof they dispute a pace, whether the substance of the bread doeth then, with his accidentes and qualities, get him home againe, or that the Rattes or Mice do gnaw vpon nothing else, but onely vpon the accidents and qualities, without touching the bread. It is verie true, that the maister of the Sentences did leaue off this point very slenderly. For these are his wordes:
                  
                     Verelie it may well be said, that vnreasonable beastes do not eate the bodie of Christ, although it seemeth they doe so:
                     In the booke of Sentences the 1. chap. dist. 11. 
                     but then, what is it that the Mouse taketh, or what is it that shee eateth? That doth God knowe.
                  
                  Yet notwithstanding, those other doctours, which haue written vpon the booke

of Sentences, are not therwithall satisfied, but will yet haue a further consideration of the matter: especially considering, that the glosse of Henricus de Vrimaria,
                     A mouse and a sinner in the 1. chap. of the 9. dist. in the 4. booke of the Sentences. written vpon that text, saieth thus: That the mouth of a Mouse is not so vncleane, as the mouth of a sinner, And all they generally doe teache, that the sinners doe without doubt eate the verie bodie of Christ: Ergo Potlid.
                  Nowe besides this, yet can they not agree amongest themselues, to knowe whether all the woordes which they of themselues haue added, which are not written by the Euangelistes, doe serue necessarily to the Transubstantiation, or no? For Thomas de Aquino, will stoutely defende, That they are most necessarie therevnto, and that without them the Tarte cannot bee well baked. Now against this, Bonauentura, and maister Henricus de Gandauo, with diuerse other, writing vpon the fourth Booke of the Sentences, say that these wordes serue onely to beautifie and set foorth the other for comelinesse sake: but it is needlesse for Scotus to write his opinion, considering that it cannot bee certeinly knowne, whether they bee verie

needfull or no. And yet notwithstanding, he doth conclude, that the Priest is bounde to say them, neither more nor lesse, than as if they were most necessarie to the framing or making of the Transubstantiation. And Guido de monte Rocherii, doeth flatly confesse, That he knowes not what to say to the matter.
                  Then further they are in contention,Wine with water transubstantiated. whether the water which they doe mingle with the wine in the Chalice, is first chaunged into wine, and after that into bloud: so that there shoulde be two transubstantiations at once? Or that it is incontinent and by and by turned into bloud, as well as the wine? And if it become bloud, as appeareth it shoulde, by the example of the two Gosseps, of whome I spake before, by what power that can bee so, seeing Christ did not meddle with anie water, nor the Euangelistes doe not write anie thing thereof? And then, if the Priest shoulde putte more water into it, than wine, (whiche they doe not gladly,This question you shal haue in the writers of the Sentences, in the 5. chap. the 11. dist. in the 4. booke. or willingly:) whether then the Transubstantiation shoulde take full effect, or that it would stay, for doubt of drowning in the water?
                  
                     Item, if by chance, after that the wine be consecrated, & turned into bloud, one should put into the Chalice as much wine more, whether then the first wine shoulde bee no more bloud, but become wine again, or that it should be bloud and wine mingled together: either that it shoulde all together bee turned into bloud? Item, whether a Priest may say and serue Masse with vinegre, or veriuce, or with must, or whether for neede with beere: and whether that the beere (after the fiue wordes spoken,Looke in the booke called Encheiridion sacerdotum, in the 3. chap. de sacramento Euchar.
                      and all parts of the transubstantiation well plaid) could doe his office as well as the wine, and leape soudeinly out of one substance into another? Item, if there were thirtene or fourtene Offertories, Ostes, or singing cakes, laid vpon the altar, and that the priest could tell no better than my maide, and so tolde but twelue, and vppon that intent doe pronounce the fiue wordes, thinking that there were but twelue: then whether all the thirtene should be consecrated and transubstantiated: considering that the intent and meaning of the Priest, is wholie necessarie to the transubstantiation: or that neuer one of them should be transubstantiated, cōsidering that the one hath as much vantage as

the other, and not any one of them more base or bastard than an other, seeing that they all did heare and vnderstand the wordes of the Transubstantiation indifferently, one as well as another.
                  There are yet (besides these) manie other like difficulties, sufficient to make deuout catholike men to doubt, touching this foresaid article of transubstantiation: for (I assure you) they trouble the heades euen of our masters of Louen, and are oftimes occasion that they must drinke two or three quartes of wine the more, and sometimes be so dronke, that they fall from the benche, and catch a redde nose: yea, and sometime that they dispute the haire from their heads, through the great zeale wherewith they are warmed, whereby they often fall into dronken diseases, and sometime into Plurisies, whereof diuerse times they die: and so the Church of Rome doth faile of her best pillars. And yet for all this, as concerning the highest and most principall article of transubstantiation, they al danse after one pipe, and agree as well in one, as Herode and Pilate. And as touching the rest, they remit that to God, to take care for: for after that they haue brought forth many cunning

trickes, and deepe wittie speculations, and bralled about those a long time, and in vtramque partem, that is to say, pro & cō
                        tra, to and fro, haue reasoned on both sides verie Magistraliter, that is, Maisterly in deed. In the end they make this cōclusion: Sed quomodo hoc fit,
                     In the 4. booke of the sentences in the before named dist. 
                     nescio, Deus scit: that is, I cannot tell what to say to the matter, I cannot conceiue how that may come to passe, God knoweth all: And yet notwithstanding, they doe alway conclude this to be an article of the faith, whereof no man must doubt. For our deare mother the holy Church will haue it so. And yet in the meane space, for the better stay of deuout cō
                     sciences, & somthing to establish these great doubts, they haue ioyntly found out a newe practise to prop vp their generall building of Transubstantiation, to wit, first a great beame which they call Concomitantiae: & then a long rib, called, The stedfast intention of the holy Church: wherewith they do so strongly prop vp this building, that not only Christs bodie,Whether a Priest being halfe dronken, & in a dream, can make the bodie of Christ, &c. but the whole Godhead may s

                     and vpon it without falling. And if it were so, that the priest did dreame, & had no regard to his Masse: yet haue they a remedie for that. For the good intent of the holie

Church is so sure and vnremoueable, that the intent of the Priest is not greatly to be accounted of, but may well inough go walk abrode, and see if there be anie good cheare toward, and that his maid keepe good rule at home, which is a iolly matter. For otherwise, if the priest were yet half dronke with good cheare the eeuen before, or that his maid had chafed him, or that but only a flie did come & sit vpon his nose, he might perhaps therby forget his good intent, euen as he was speaking the holy wordes, and then should not that bread bec

                     meth the holy Church now in for a helpe, & doth set forth for a perfit article of our faith, that it is likewise sufficient for euerie one to beleue, whatsoeuer the Church beleues, although they know not what it is.

                      And again it is sufficient that the holy church haue generally a perfite determination, that wheresoeuer Masse is don, there is the bred changed into God, although it were so that the priest did thinke onely vpon his maid, or on his kitchen. In summe, there is not a hole, but the hellish Church hath a peg to stop it

withall, she can turne euerie thing to the best: so that there is no more difficultie. And if the Doctours and Licentiates, doe chide and brall among themselues, that makes no great matter: we ought to commit all these weightie causes, to the iudgement of the holie Catholike Church, and must simplie and ioyntly beleeue, That as soone as the fiue wordes are spoken, that which the Priest hath in his handes is turned into God, let it then be what it will, either verie bread, or the accidents of bread, or an Indiuiduum vagum, that is, a wilde veseken. That is no matter at all to vs, it is sufficient that wee knowe it is our God, which we must pray vnto in the Masse. For the text is plaine: This is my bodie, there needes no glosse vpon it. And although it be so, that all the Doctours of Louen, of Paris, and of Colen, cannot vnderstand it: yet it is sufficient for vs, that we haue fetcht our transubstantiation out of it, and sette it forth irreuocably. Although we haue yet manie mo other plaine textes, whereby to defend it: which are verie plentifully sette forth by the worshipfull Eckius, and other worthie pillars of the holie Catholike Church: as specially that which is written

in Ieremie, That when the vngodly Iewish Priests and false Prophets went about to bring Ieremie to death, because hee did earnestly condemne their vngodlinesse, they said thus one to another: Let vs marre his bread with wood, or let vs destroy the fruite together with the tree, & roote him out of the kingdome of the liuing. For this now hath our deare mother the holie Church turned for the best vnto our Masse priests, as though they had holden this Counce

                      that is to say, Let vs cast wood into his bread, vnderstanding thereby, that they will counterfeit (in their Masse) the passion & death of Iesu Christ, who suffred vpon the crosse, with a peece of bread. And to this end doe they cause these woordes to be soung yerely in the Passion: wherevpon shee hath resolutely concluded, That the bread is chaunged into the verie bodie of Christ Iesus: as is to bee seene in the foresaid booke of Eckius, and of other stoute Champions of the Romish Church. Yea, and likewise to proue that this Transubstantiation is neither so wonderfull, nor vnnatural, as the Heretikes exclaime, that doeth Eckius
                     
teach out of the Scripture, where the diuel said to Christ:Mat. 4.3. 
                     If thou be the son of God, commande that these stones bee made bread. Consider now, is not that a plain declaration, wherto no answer is to be made? And by this it is wel to be thought, that the diuell woulde gladly haue had a Masse in the wildernesse, but onely that it could not be for lacke of bread. And this may possibly be the cause, wherefore our mother the holie Church doth (vpon all the altars, and in all thee bookes, where this storie is in hand and dealt withall) clothe the diuell in a friers cowle, to the end men may knowe, that he was an holie Heremit,The diuell did Masse in the wildernesse. or an Anker, which did verie deuoutly say Masse in the wildernesse, and therefore doth looke out so Masselike. But when he saw he did lacke bread, then he sought and made meanes to our Lorde, to see if he would erect a newe transubstantiation. And now, because this temptation of the diuell is in the Hebrewe tongue called Massah, (as is before rehearsed) therefore it is not to be thought vnlike,
                        Massah is Missa.
                      that our Masse hath thereof borrowed her name. For as Satan said: Commaunde that these stones be made bread: so say the priests in their Masse: Command that

this bread be made a bodie, or flesh.
                  
                  Wherein the Priestes are something more likerish, than their maister was: for that they will not bee contented with drie bread▪ but that hath his vnderstanding and meaning. Howbeit thus much it is in effect, That our dere mother the holy church, hath out of this Massah, or temptatiō of the diuell, verie strongly established her Transubstantiation.
               
               
                  The vi. Chapter. Establishing the sufficiencie of the Sacrament vnder the substance of bread alone.
                  WE haue heretofore set forth, that the holie Church of Rome hath directly against the cōmandment of Christ against the vse of the Apostles, and against the long continued custome & maner of the primatiue Church commanded, That the Lay people should not receiue the Sacrament of the Lordes Supper, but vnder one kind only, to wit, of the bread: as it is plainly set foorth in the decree at the Councel of Constance, here before declared. But now because it shal not seeme that she hath much a do to wrest a text or twaine of the Scripture, & to bring them in to serue her turne, she doth therfore allege here manifest texts

wherewith she doth set all things net, fine, and in perfect frame.

                        ng of his bloud, he hath left in the penne.To begin withall, it is written in the 6. of Iohn, This is that bread which commeth from heauen, that he which eateth thereof should not die. I am that liuing bread which came downe from heauen: if anie man eate of this bread, he shal liue for euer. And the bread that I will giue, is my flesh, which I will giue for the life of the world, &c.
                  
                  Note here, now doth he meddle but with the bread (saith Eckius) Ergo the Lay people neede not the wine. That soundes as well, as if a man shoulde make this argument: Christ saith in the 15. of Iohn, I am the true vine,
                     
                        Iohn. 15.1.5. 
                     you are the braunches, &c. Here he speakes onely of the vine, and not of the bread: Ergo the Lay people need not receiue the Sacrament vnder the substance of bread, but only vnder the substance of a vine. Is not that verie well reasoned, to catch the Heretikes in a trap? After that we read, that Christ was known in Emaus vnto two of his disciples,Luk. 24.30.31. by breaking of bread: & there is not one word of drinking: Ergo the Lay people may not drink out of the Chalice. And if anie man thinke that

Christ should not there haue ministred a sacrament (as the Heretikes will say) that is a lie: for our deare mother the holie church hath determined otherwise, declaring that he did minister the Sacrament two times, once at Hierusalem, for the Priests,In his manuel or

                        re he saith that 27 of Christs disciples were all Cardinals. at his last supper: & another time at Emaus, for the Lay people, after his resurrection. And although it is certeine, that these two disciples were Cardinals, & not Lay men, as Eckius in deede doth finely mainteine in a certein place: yet what is that to the purpose? Did you neuer see Cardinals that were no Priests? That is no newes. There are now a dayes that are but young children, & newly crept out of the shelles. And when all this is saide, there is no where written,Looke in the foresaide booke of Eckius, and vpon other Catholikes which do found vpon this argument. that these two disciples had shauen crownes, or the priestly character or cognisance: Ergo then must they needes be Lay people. Now thirdly, we pray thus in the Pater noster, Giue vs this day our daily bread, and we do not speake of anie wine: wherfore then should the Lay people desire to drinke wine in the Communion? And although the priests thēselues sing the same wordes in their Masse, & yet notwithstanding are not content with drie bread: that

cannot serue the turne. For the prrests must needes haue some prerogatiue, because they are the beloued children of our mother the holy Church. Fourthly, 
                        •
                     uke in the Acts of the Apostles writeth: That those which beleeued,
                     Act. 2.42. 
                     continued in the Apostles doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayer: which streight-way after he setteth out more amplie, saying: And sold their possessions & goods, and parted them to al men,
                     Act. 2.45.46 
                     as euery man had neede. And they continued daily with one accord in the Temple, & brake bread in euerie house, and did eate their meate together with gladnes and singlenes of heart, praysing God. Out of this doth our deare mother the holie Church cō
                     clude, That the cup ought not to be ministred vnto the Lay people in the Supper of the Lorde, because that here is no mention made of wine, but onely of bread. For although in manie other places of holy scripture, all kindes of meates and drinkes are vnderstoode vnder the name of bread and eating: yet that can not take place here, considering that our deare mother the holy Church hath otherwise interpreted the same. And Paul hath directly written, That

all men should esteeme the Apostles and Preachers as Ministers of Christ,
                     1: Cor. 4.8. 
                     and disposers of the secretes of God. For out of this doth our dere mother the holie Church teach,This is set forth by brother Barnard of Luxenburgh, to this end, with the arguments following in the register of Heretikes, in the 12. part of the 4. booke. That the Priests are to be resembled to God, and are mediators betweene God and the people, and so by this meanes may freely chaunge or alter the Sacraments, as they shall thinke good. Is not this a subtile and double dealing with the Scripture? Wherefore then doe these Heretikes say, That we haue no scriptures wherewith to defend this our doing, whereas we bring in sacks ful of Scripture, as all men may see.
                  And then, touching that they will beate vs with our owne rodde, saying, That the Church her selfe hath alwayes done otherwise, as may appeare out of the ancient fathers, Councels, and Canons, we care not a point for that: we hang that on the hatch. For all that is past and gone, the worlde is now in another state than it was then. For in those dayes, they were for the most part all readie to shedde their bloud for the christian beliefe.This is written by the foresaid Barnard Professor of diuinitie in the same place before written. And for that cause did they drinke the bloud of Christ, as the Catholike Doctours haue written, according to the doctrine of Cyprianus, saying,

                     how can they shed their owne bloud for Christes sake,
                     
                        Cyprianus in his 3. epistle and 2. booke written to Caecilius.
                      
                     if they doe not drinke of Christs bloud? But now there is no more tidings of those matters: for the holy church of Rome wil not lose one drop of her bloud: considering that she hath ynough to do for the defence of the holy Catholike faith, to shed the bloud of the Lutherans and Caluinists,
                     Psal. 72.1. like water in the streetes. And therefore it is not any more needful that the Lay people should drinke the bloud of Christ out of the Chalice vnder the substance of wine. They can digest it well inough rawe, as it was shed out of the bodie of Christ Iesus: yet for all that, the priests haue this aduantage, that they may drinke the bloud of Christ both waies. And yet is not the bloud of Christ in the Sacrament, taken quite away from the Lay people. For when they do eate the whole body, with flesh & bones, it is certeine, that they gette in the bloud wall. For the before named Bonauentura doth make mention of a certein miracle, of one which would not beleue that there was any bloud in the holy Ost,Dist. 4. quaest. 2. or singing bread, vsed in the holie Masse,
                        Ecki

                           s in his Manuel or Encheiridion locorum.
                      and sodeinly there came bloud rūning out. And likewise Alexander de Ales doth declare, that vpō a time

when the people would haue receiued the Sacrament vnder both kindes, there was sodenlie before them a platter full of bloud, whereof the good deuoute people being meruellously abashed, were glad to content them selues with the one. And that the bloud (vndoubtedlie) is with the bodie, we haue here before by manie other miracles declared, sufficientlie proued. Therefore haue the Laie people no occasion to complaine, as though the bloud of Christ were denied them: for euen the Priestes them selues are contented with one kinde, on the good Fridaie next after the shire Thursday,
                        Eckius and Barnardus in the places before spoken of and named. when they haue had their sops in good Bastard or Romnay. For then the next day, being good. Friday, they sing a drie Masse, and keepe a Mouses banket, as well as the Laie people doe at Easter.A drie Masse on good Friday Before time likewise, in the Iewish church the Laie people had no parte of the drinke offerings, but the Priestes onelie. For although that Chrysostome saith,
                     In the 18. Homil. or sermon vpon the 2. Epist. to the Corinthians. 
                     touching this matter, that this is now changed, and that in this Sacrament the Laie people must enioye the like meate and drinke as the Priestes doe,
                     
                        Chrysostomus.
                      
                     so as nowe the one hath no more aduantage than

the other, as they had in the olde Lawe: yet can not the saying of Chrysostome anie thing serue in this place. For against Chrysostome wil we set Brother Barnard of Luxenburgh, professour in Theologie, and Iohn Eckius, with all other good Catholike writers of our time, who haue otherwise written and determined of this matter. And as touching that which the Huguenotes do alledge out of Paule: yea, out of Iesus Christ him selfe, saying, That Paule did command all christen people, to do according as Christ had ordeined, and as Christ had saide: Drinke all of this: We do answere to that, That this was onelie a simple permission,
                     This is the answer of the before written Barnardus brought vpon this place 
                     and not a speciall commandement: as he saith in another place: Destroie this temple, and I will builde it vp againe within three dayes: for that is no commaundement, but onely a permission, as if he said: If it be so in deede, that you will destroie this temple of my bodie, I will not forbidde you, but I will builde him vp againe, &c. In like manner doeth our mother the h

                     lie Church saie, that these woordes, Drinke you all of this: And, As often as you

drinke this, you shall declare the death of the Lord: Those wordes are thus to be vnderstoode, as though he had said: I doe not will you Laie people to doe so, but the Priestes onelie: notwithstanding, if you will doe it, and that the Priestes are contented withall, I will not then bee against it. Thus you see the game is won. Nowe let vs to an other matter, tending to the like ende.
               
               
                  The vii. Chapter. VVhich doeth treate of full satisfaction for sinnes, of the desertes of good workes: also of the merites of Christes passion, and of Iustification: of the difference betweene mortall sinnes and veniall sinnes: and of the assured hope of saluation.
                  NOwe,Of merites & iustification. seeing that wee haue sufficientlie spoken of the holie Masse, and the Sacrament of the altar, and that our mother the holie Church of Rome doeth moreouer teache and set foorth for an article of the faith, That wee, by desert, hearing a Masse, and receiuing the Sacrament, may make full amendes for our offences, and sufficientlie satisfie for our sinnes: therefore it is now verie necessarie,

that we something treate of satisfaction for sinnes, and of deseruing by good works, the rather, because the Heretikes do with their scriptures so trouble vs, touching this point, as they turne both the spit and the rost meat into the ashes: in so much that wee shall loose both the sheepe and the fleece, if wee suffer this to be so plucked from vs. And therefore it is necessarie to put all good Catholike children in remembrance, that in no wise they doe giue anie eare to the Heretikes, touching this point, for feare lest therby they should be brought out of the right way, and so by receiuing their goodlie reasons & multitude of scriptures, be persuaded from their due obedience to the holie Church of Rome. And to the ende that euerie man should be warned, and not by negligence sodenlie taken in a trappe, therefore shall I set out (something more at large) their meaning touching this point, to the ende that euery one may see, whether our deare mother the holie Church haue not iust occasion so bitterlie to curse and banish their doctrine.
                  Then, to beginne withall, they do take vpon them to defende and mainteine by Scripture, That all sinnes are deadlie &

all those which doe faithfullie beleeue in him, life and iustification. In so much that they nowe, in the person of Iesus Christ, as partakers of his bodie,Roma 2.16. Galat. 4.6.7. 1. Iohn. 4.19. Esa

and rise vp in newnesse of life, and hereafter liue and reigne with him eternallie: but they will in no wise consent, that these troubles, crosses, & afflictions, should serue anie thing for satisfaction or remission of sinnes, no not so much as for the least sinne that can be thought vpō. And likewise they clearely dissent & disagree from vs, saying, That al the good works that anie man can do, during all his life, can not serue him to anie purpose for the remission of the least sinne that euer he committed: considering that al men (without exceptiō) are of meere dutie bound to obey God, to loue him with all their hearts, with all their might, with all their power, in body and soule, with thanks, & in all that lieth in them: & to loue their neighbours as thēselues: in such maner, as though they had accōplished al this,Gala. 2.10. 1. Cor. 8.46. Roma. 3.9.10.11.19.22. Roma. 5.12.17.19. Luke. 17.10.
                      (which is impossible for anie man to doe, for that we are dead in Adam, and that all the thoughtes of mans heart, & all the conceites of his mind are meere mischiefe and malice against God, euen from the beginning) in so much that they should yet remaine vnprofitable seruantes,Roma. 8.7. Gene. 6.5.8.21. Iohn. 3.6.
                      and should haue done no more than they of verie dutie were bound to do: So farre doeth it differ

that they should be able thereby to satisfie God, & make amends for any such offences, as they heretofore haue committed. For if they should come in reckoning by works, then wee must make a perfect reckoning,Roma. 4.4.11.6.
                      & not halfe a reckoning (say they:) otherwise works were no works: but contrawise, when men do seeke for mercie, & not for iustice,Phi. 3.7.8. Gala. 15.16.
                      then must they (wt Paul) forsake all their works, all their righteousnes, their holines, & all whatsoeuer they haue done, & accompt the same as nothing, to obteine iustification by faith, through God mercy: for otherwise mercie were no mercie.Roma. 11.6.
                      And after this, they proceede on further, & conclude in this forme and manner:

                     Now, seeing God will not accept any iustificatiō by those works which he him selfe commanded in his Law, how much lesse will he accept these workes which other men haue deuised, and fetched out of their owne heades, which hee neuer commaunded? As, to hearing of Masse, to runne from one Church to another, to trudge from one altar to another, to go on pilgrimage▪ to weare hairecloth, to whippe them selues, to pull a Friers hoode ouer their head, to make vowes,

which God neuer allowed, with such other like workes, which the holie church doeth esteeme for verie meritorious, & calleth them Opera supererogationis, that is to say, Superfluous workes,
                     Workes of the Catholikes. 
                     for that God neuer commanded them: & therefore men may hereby do more than they are of dutie boūd to do. These (say they) shall not onelie be vnacceptable before GOD, for good payement, but shall rather be esteemed for false coyne: yea, bee imputed for verie slandering and blaspheming of God,
                     Esaie. 1.15. as before. 
                     and for a flat forsaking and despising of the shedding of the bloud of Iesus Christ. O what a matter is this! O helpe blessed Ladie of the 7. Okes! Help S. Lewen, S. Rombold, S. Iames of Cōpostell, with all your scallop shelles, and pilgrims staues: helpe all you sweet men and women Saints, whose relikes are deuoutly prayed vnto by our deere mother. How can it be, that she should be so ouerseene? should then all good catholikes haue hitherto reckoned, and still do reckon without their host? should our forefathers haue deserued none otherwise by building Cloisters, Abbies, Trentals, Masses, and such like deuotions? should all that be lost?

O no, I defie that. We will rather forsake the whole Scripture, Peter and Paule, with the whole rable of them, than that such a slaunder should rise and take place in the holy Catholike, Apostolike, Popish church of Rome. For if that were so, then should all our Decrees & decretals, all our Sentences and Se
                        •
                     tentiaries, al orders & ordinances, old customes, vsages, priuiledges, and old proceedings of the holie church, all masses, with the appurtenances, al priests and priestly doings, and so one diuell with another be cleane ouerthrowen. And then it must needes followe, that the Lutherans, Zwinglians, & Caluinistes, shal yet againe beare the swing, & all the shorne swarme of holie shauelings, with all the Sophisters & Theologians of Louen, with all the newe Bishops, Abbats, Monks & Prelats, giue place. To what purpose then (I pray you) should the Duke of Alba with his Spaniards serue, hauing taken so troublesome a iournie vpon him, to stand the Bishops instead of Sargeants & hangmen: and to set vp the ruined Romish church in her authoritie againe? O no, no, we will neuer be giuen to vnderstand & beleeue, that the scripture doth teach this: for otherwise the scriptures

must be heretical, & directly against the holie church: & then shuld the scriptures haue deserued to be burnt, aswel as the Huguenotes. Wel, surely our Doctors of Louen haue likewise perused the scriptures, & our newe Bishops do daily reade their seruice & Masse booke, at lest when they haue leasure: but they find not this written there: & therfore it is to be thought, that either the heretikes haue other Epistles & Gospels, than is written in our Masse booke, & read in the church: or there is more malt in the mill, than the miller will be acknowen of. For although our mother the holy church is content to graunt the heretiks, that Christ is our right redeemer, & hath sufficiently satisfied for our sins (because it shal not seeme they haue vtterlie forsaken Christ, & thrust him out of his seat) yet is not that so to bee vnderstood, that he onely must be taken for our ful raunsome and satisfaction, or that he should haue fullie made our peace wt God the Father, through the offering vp of his bodie & bloud: so as we should now (through his merites) be esteemed for righteous, and the children of God, and haue an assured belefe, that God hath (for his sake) forgiuen vs all our sinnes, & is to vs a good & louing

Father (as these heretikes will needes proue by their Bible.) No, no, it wil not go so easilie to worke: we must go otherwise to worke: we our selues must paie our debtes with our owne monie, & satisfie God sufficiently for our sinnes, or otherwise all would be naught. For it doth not beecome the mercie of God (saith the councel of Trent) that he should forgiue vs our debtes for nothing,

                     without anie former satisfactiō. And although it be so, that Paul doeth take on him to defend,These are the proper wordes of Paule to the Romanes in the .4. Chapter. 2.5.6.7.

Blessed is that man to whō God imputeth not sin:
                     These are the very wordes of the councell of Trent the .6. session. can. de. iustificatione.
                      yet, that holie ghost of the coūcell of Trent hath concluded the contrarie, saying thus: Whosoeuer will defend & mainteine, that the vngodly are iustified by faith only, & that

for the obteyning of Gods mercie, his works are not needful, let him be accursed. And our Doctors of Louen haue once for all acknowledged & iudged, That God may not impute righteousnes to any mā through faith, vnlesse he be righteous of him selfe. For consider, this is the conclusion of the worshipfull & profound learned Magistri nostri, Ioice Rauēstein of Thielt in his booke which he now (a while agoe) did write against the Lutherans of Antwerpe.
                  
                  
                     This pretended righteousnes (saith he) doeth tend first against naturall reason:

                     for it cannot stand with any natural reason▪ that one which had no wisedome in his head, should yet notwithstanding be called wise: either else righteous, who hath no inwarde righteousnesse in him selfe.
                  
                  
                     Secondarilie, it is slaunderous against the holie Ghost, who hath testified and witnessed of manie men in the scripture, that they were righteous before God: & so should the holy Ghost be attached for a false witnesse.
                  
                  
                     Thirdlie, it doeth differ from the doctrine of the Catholike Fathers.
                  
                  
                     Consider now, here we haue a clere iudgement & irreuocable sentence: wherevpon it must rest, That Paule hath spoken amisse, in saying, that God doeth ascribe righteousnes to the vngodlie without any works. For, what is the meaning of this asc
                        •
                     ibing our alowing? Our sharpwitted Magistri nostri of Louen can not by their naturall reasons, nor wt al then Syllogismes, Quotlibets, nor other speculacions, conceiue the same: no nor will permit that God should impute righteousnes, or yet couer sinnes through the merites of Christ, to one that were not righteous of him selfe by deeds, & that had sufficiently satisfied for his sinnes by his deeds: so that God is not licenced to name things that are not, as though they were, as Paule ascribes vnto him: or to deck vs with a righteousnes and obedience which we haue not deserued our selues:Rom. 4.17.
                      our deare mother the holie Church of Rome doeth esteeme it for a foolishnes, vntowardnesse, and blasphemie against God, that Christ onelie should be our wisedome, our righteousnes, our holines, and our only redemption. Shee will haue it, that we shall euen of our selues, and by our selues, haue our owne wisedome, righteousnesse,

holinesse, and redemption before God, at least, if we will be esteemed for righteous. She doth esteeme it for a foolish and faithlesse trust, that one should trust to the righteousnesse of anie other than him selfe. She will haue it, that euerie one shall be iustified by his owne righteousnesse, and by his owne merites, and therewithall satis

                      and persuade the best betwixt both, saying, That it doth not well become the righteousnesse of God, that he should deale with those which before baptisme haue (through negligence) fallen into sinne, in the same maner, as with those which after the baptisme haue willingly and wittingly defiled the Temple of God, and made sad the holie ghost.
                  
                  She doth plainly acknowledge, that euen at the first houre of their birth, they

haue deserued death, and are fallen into the curse and wrath of God: yet for all that, she will take vpon her to be a meane betwene parties at variance, and be like vnto Butter which bettereth althings, & therfore wil haue this hold, That God as touching originall sinne, shall bee satisfied by washing away the same by baptisme, not receiuing or requiring anie other satisfaction or raunsome for that matter, and for this hath shee also named Baptisme, The first plancke whereby we are saued in our shipwrack. But I assure you, as touching all other sinnes, shee doth sing vs a new song, as followeth:
                  
                     In the 7. session at the councell of Trent de bapt. cano. 10.

                     Sinnes committed after baptisme. 
                     should either be forgeuen, or at least may be forgeuen onely through faith and power of Baptisme, let him be accursed.
                  
                  Here you may see now, that this planke alone is too weake, to beare vs out of the water, so that Baptisme is not (in anie wise) the Lauer or bath of those that are

borne a newe, wherein Christ shoulde haue purged and cleane washed his spouse, that she might become without spot or wrinkle, as Paule goeth about to teach:Tit 3.5. Ephe. 5.26.
                      but onelie forsomuch as doeth apperteine to the first spotte wherewith we are borne,Math. 3.11. Mar. 1.4. Luke. 3.3. Act. 13.24.19 4. Rom. 6.3. In the .14. session, can. 2. de sacramentis poenitentiae.
                      and no further. Neither is nowe anie more a Baptisme of conuersion & penance, as it was in the Apostles time. For the holie Fathers assembled in the Councell of Trent, haue accursed all those that shall call it a Lauer or bath, and Sacrament of conuersion and repentaunce. And therefore haue they prouided an other planke for vs, wherewith wee may swimme out of this water, (as lustily as with a couple of Hogges bladders:) to witte, the Tree of penance, consisting of three braunches: namely, Confessio, that is Shrift: Contritio, that is Heartes sorrow: and Satisfactio,

                     that is Full satisfaction, and a plenarie payment for our sinnes. For this is the Saint Christopher that can carrie vs ouer the Sea: and through this shall wee receiue once at our Baptisme the garment of innocencie, and being afterwardes bespotted with sinne, wash the same off again, & bring all into the right way. Therefore it will

be said, according to the vnderstanding of our deare mother the holie Church, as manie holie Catholike Champions haue both said and written, That Christ hath made full satisfaction for originall sinne, and hath fed vs when we coulde not yet slie, but now that our fethers are ful growen, we must slie of our selues out of the nest, and helpe our selues: That is to bee vnderstood, We must from henceforth satisfie and sufficiently recompense for all our sinnes our owne selues, For this is the opinion and meaning of manie holie Champions and pillars of the holie church of Rome, as doth euidently appeare by the before written example of the two pillars. But yet notwithstanding, when all is well considered, this is not yet the verie right tune and harmonious noyse, which the holie Church commonly vseth in this daunse: for out of this might follow, That God should impute righteousnesse to those which are not righteous in them selues: and through Christs merites, and for his sake, forgiue sinnes without any other satisfaction. I tell you, our mother the holie Church will not meddle with this pretended righteousnes: She will not remaine in Gods debte, but

will clere the score, and cut off all the nicks of the tallie. Therefore hath she a little patched vp this, and concluded, That men shall likewise satisfie for some part of originall sinne, and so fully satisfie God, because he shall not hereafter report, that hee hath forgeuen and pardoned the same, for nothing, but for Iesus Christes sake onely. For weigh this wel, this is the vtter determination and conclusion of our maisters of the Sentences,These are the very woordes of the schoole writers, like as they are sette by Gabriel in the .3. booke of Sentences. dist 20. in the .5. cō

                     That although the merits of Christ are the most speciall desert, through which Gods mercie, and the way into the kingdome of heauen is graunted vnto vs, yet this notwithstanding, is in no wise to be reckoned for the only, whole, and full satisfaction and deseruing: Whereby it doth euidently appeare, that alway with the merites of Christ, there must be ioyned some deeds and workes of those, which receiue the mercie and rewarde, whether it be for themselues, if they be of age: or for another which is not yet come to full yeeres of vnderstanding: which deedes are called Meritum de congruo, vel condigno, that is to say, A deseruing worthily obteined, or, A l

                     Originall Sinne.Consider then, now doth it followe, that for the redeeming of originall sinne, some meritorious works are adioyned: and specially the merites of the Sacrament, which (as our mother the holy Church saieth) doe giue vnto men mercie, Ex opere operato, that is to say, For the worthinesse of it selfe,

                     and deseruing by woorkes. For whosoeuer will say and defend, that the Sacraments shoulde not Ex opere operato, or by their owne worthinesse, present and giue mercie vnto vs: but that faith or beleefe in Gods promises, should be sufficient for the obteining of mercy, (as Paul saieth that Abraham did beleeue the promise of God,

And because it shall not seeme, that the Sacrament of baptisme is not sufficient to deserue the forgiuenesse of sinne, Ex opere operato, considering that the childe which is christened, doth not there worke,The deseruing by the Godfathers in Bapt

deserue it for the child. And to the end that this deseruing may the more freely be put in the reckoning against the accusations of the diuell, therefore hath our mother the holy Church deckt it trimly, and hanged much costly ware about it, as specially strong and mightie coniuring,Christening of children papistically. and commaunding of the diuell, wherethrough he is forced to remoue streight way, and giue place to the holy ghost. Item, with manie holie crosses, which the Priest doeth make ouer the foreheade, ouer the eyes, the nose, the eares, the mouth, the breast and the shoulders of the children so christned: by the might & power whereof, the diuell & originall sinne, are chaced seuen mile frō thence, so that his accusation is not esteemed worth a straw. After this is the child gresed on the nose and eares, with the priests snot & spittle: which spittle doth bring a maruellous strength with it, as men may wel cōiecture: so that of necessitie it must thereby receiue the mercie of God. And in the end is giuen vnto it a white cloth, or a coyfe, and a waxe candle burning, which the Godfathers do receiue in the name of the childe, which surely is maruellous acceptable & welcome vnto God, as the holy Church doeth beare

witnesse, euerie Easter eeue, singing vnto the waxe Candle, whiche the Priestes do at that time hallow:This is in the Masse booke. in oratione ad bene dicendum ignem in Sabatho sanct. pasch.
                      
                     Talia igitur Domine digna sacris altaribus tuis munera offerimus, quibus te laetari religio Christiana non ambigit: That is to say, Therfore Lorde doe wee offer vnto thee, such worthie presents and giftes vpon thine altar, wherein (as Christian Religion nothing doubteth) thou doest greatly delight and reioyce, &c.
                  
                  How must he then reioyce herein, when hee shall see all these precious giftes and goodly ceremonies together, whereby deuout persons haue greatly refourmed, and trimly set forth the ordinances of his sonne Iesus Christ? Will not he with a good will forgiue both originall sinne, and also the rest of the whole debte, seeing hee is so w

                     ed with wax, with tallow, with creame, and with spittle? And then doeth not hee forgiue for nothing, and onelie for the merites of Christ (as the Heretikes say) but he is satisfied with redie paiment. And if he will not yet be therewithall content, then we will fill his hands with a heape of deseruings of holie Saintes of both kindes, for which onely he must vndoubtedly

forgiue the whole debt, yea although it were asmuch more, insomuch as there shall not be left one iot vnsatisfied.
                  But howe nowe, may some deuout Catholike heart thinke, is Christ then nothing at all accounted of, nor regarded, by our deare mother the holie Church? O yes by Saint Marie, for shee doeth vse him specially to stoppe all holes withall. For if so be that neither our paiments and satisfactions, nor the merits of saints would be sufficient to discharge the whole debt, but that there should remaine some behind vnpaid, then that must be laide on his necke. But if we be of our selues sufficiently furnished to satisfie all that resteth, or if wee can by some of the Saintes, to whome wee haue good deuotion, get a good suretie or pledge which will answere for all: then wee shall haue no neede to trouble Christ much, wee can spare him well enough. Then onelie, if we hauing done our best to satisfie all our selues, or to finde a sufficient suretie, and yet can not bring either of both to passe, then saieth our deare mother the holie Church, that Christ must come foorth, Vt suppleat nostros defectus, that is to say, To supplie our defaultes, and to stoppe

all holes. But nowe, because all this doeth seeme verie vnhandsome, and that Christ might perhaps take this in euill part, and perchaunce forsake vs, and cast vs cleane off, and send vs back againe to our Baalim, and other Patrones, at whose handes wee haue first sought help, as he hath oftentimes giuen warning by his Prophetes,Iere. 11.11.12.
                      so as then by that meanes we should fall betwixt two stooles in the ashes, and so be forsaken on all sides: To auoid this daunger, the catholike doctors haue a little strengthned the rampier, and baked the cake after another maner, as may appeare in the said booke of Iodocus of Rauenstein, where he writeth:
                  
                     Whereas men do charge vs, that we teach that Christ shoulde haue satisfied only for originall sin or other sinnes cō
                        mitted before baptisme,
                     In the .80. leafe of the before specified boke of Iodocus Rauenstein written against the confesion of ye preachers at Antwerp. 
                     & that then the Masse should satisfie further for the other sinnes, our meaning is not so: and if there be anie such which do so vnderstād, or haue any such opinion, we vtterly renounce their doctrine.
                  
                  And truely their particular iudgement ought not to be applied to any former iudgment of the Catholike doctrine touching the Masse: for the verie meaning of the holy

man Thomas de Aquino, was neuer such: as appeares plainely out of that which hee writeth in the third part, vpon the first question in the 4. 
                     
                        •
                     rticle whereof he writeth:
                  
                     It is most true, that Christ came into this world, not onely to take away that sinne, wherein naturally all the posteritie of Adam are borne, but likewise to the cleansing of all other sinnes.
                  
                  And in the 49. question of the said thirde part: Christ (saith he) hath released vs frō our sinnes, Causaliter, that is, Cōcerning the cause, to wit, for that he is the onely cause of our releasment, through which all our sinnes are to bee forgiuen, as well those past, as these present, or to come. And then againe: Forsomuch as the passion of Christ, is a sure▪ generall, or common cause of the forgiuing of sinne, it must needes follow, that it bee annexed to the washing away and purging of the sinnes which we our selues haue cōmitted, which is don by baptisme & penāce, and other sacraments which haue power through the passion of Christ, &c.
                  
                  In summe, this is their meaning, That as the sinnes wherein wee fell before baptisme, haue not more aduauntage than

the other, but must all alike be holpen thorough penance and Sacramentes: which are the right satisfaction, and true raunsomming, through which God is made at one with vs, and hath forgiuen vs our sinnes. And yet they haue not gotten this power only of themselues: but for that Christ hath (through his merits and passion) deserued the same: so that by this order, Christ hath now his part in all things, seeing that he (in all the merites of the Masse, satisfactions, and other good workes,) is alway by our deare mother the holy Church called to be one. And this office is committed vnto him, that hee shall alway trudge vppe and downe, to and fro, farre and neere, with the merites of good workes and satisfaction, as a common messenger, & trauell so as they may continue in their full estimation and worship. And for that cause it is, that in all their blessings, hallowings, consecrations, coniuring, and bewitching, in all Collects, Secrets, Complets, and in all Ceremonies of the holie Church, wherein they pray vnto God for the forgiuenes of sinnes, for euerlasting life, & for all other good gifts, either spirituall, or temporall, which she requires in consideration, & the power of her almes

deedes, fasting, and abstinence, through merites, keeping of holidayes, and by the strength and power of her hallowed waters, salt, candles, palmes, hearbes, oyle, tallowe reliques, holie clothes: and also through the might of the Sacraments, the Masse, and merites of Saintes, and such other like things: and yet alway in the end they adde this conclusion, Per Christum Dominum nostrum, that is, Through Christ our Lord. As though they woulde say, that those Ceremonies and creatures, which they offer vnto God, are the right marke to shoote at: but Christ must giue the aime: or else, that those are the true mint or coyne, wherewith they make paiment to God, and doe fullie satisfie for their debtes, and that Christ is he which doth value and allow the monie for currant. And that this is the verie meaning of the holy Church of Rome, it is plaine to be noted out of the decrees of the Councel of Trent▪ Wherin are accursed and excommunicated all those which wil mainteine,

But like as the first man Adam, through his vnrighteousnes and disobedience was the onely cause, that all wee which are come of him▪ haue euerie one his owne sinne within himself, through
                           •
                         which he is of himselfe and apparantly a sinner, and an vnrighteous person: euen so likewise it is to be vnderstood, that the

righteousnes and obedience of Christ, is onely a meritorious cause, wherthrough all those which through faith and the sacramentes of faith, are borne anew in Christ, doe now receiue to themselues a righteousnes of the father, to wit euerie one his owne proper and inward righteousnes, through which he is iustified of himselfe, and hath obediently satisfied the righteousnesse of the Lawe, &c.
                  
                  Whereby is notably to be vnderstood: first that Christ is not our iustification, and likewise that we must forsake and giue ouer our owne iustification (as Paul persuadeth) to be partakers in the iustification by faith, which is in Christ Iesus:
                        1. Cor. 1.50. Iere. 23.6.33.16. Phil. 3.8.9. Roma. 10.3.
                      but contrariwise, we must iustifie our owne righteousnesse, as the Iewes did afore time, and so seeke our saluation at our selues, and in our selues, as before we haue had sinne and damnation vpon and in vs. Secondarily, out of the same we vnderstande, that wee are not borne anew, onely through Christ, but through belief and the Sacraments, in Christ▪ that is to say, That Christ is the only cause that our workes are our full accoplishment, & satisfaction, which are vnder this word Sacramēts cōteined & vnderstod:

and yet of their owne might (as is before said,) Ex opere operato, can beare vs anew, and iustifie vs. For this (by our deare mother the holy Church) is the perfect and naturall description of the Sacraments, That a Sacrament is properly called, not onely that which is a signe or token of Gods mercie,
                     The maister of of sentences in the .4. booke .1. dist. cap. 
                     but also, Forma, that is, the verie effect and substance of the hidde mercie, so that it doeth both signifie the same, and is cause of the same. So that the Sacraments do not onely signifie sanctifying, but also of themselues sanctifie: and doe (as the glosse specially setteth forth) make vs righteous, Ex opere operato, that is,

                     Out of the merites of our workes, and of our selues. So that the Sacramentes, conteining vnder them our deuocions, and our owne workes, are the only naturall and proper cause of our saluation, and do make vs Formaliter righteous: but Christ onely Causaliter, that is, for that he commeth in as a generall and farre fetched cause.

And therefore, when any good and deuout Catholike man lies a dying, wee doe not vse to breake his head much with Christ, nor to trouble him greatly with faith & hope (which he ought to haue in the death and passion or Iesus Christ:) but he must specially be put in remembrance of shrift, to receiue his God; & to be annoynted: and then after to haue a waxe candle by him, with a Crucifixe in his hand, and so persuade him to the building of some Chappell or Monasterie, and to appoint a Trentall of soule Masses, and to remember Vigils & annuall or yerelie prayers, and such like. And if Christ bee (by chance) spoken of, that doeth commonlie happen, to the intent the better to set forth and preferre the said Masses, Vigils, and annuals, and the rest of the baggage: for Christ of him self is not set by nor esteemed at all. In summe, Christ is onelie necessarie and fitte to serue the holie Church of

                     Rome, her purpose in this point, & that is to coine good monie of bad & naughtie metal. For if Christ had not died, God would without doubte, that all men shoulde haue fulfilled his Lawe fullie in all pointes: hee would haue iudged all things according to his woorde and Lawe, without hauing anie respect at all to our deuotions and meritorious woorkes, or to Saint Frauncis, or to Saint Dominikes order. And besides that, hee would in the ende haue punished all breakers of his lawe, with eternall maledi

                     ion, death, and damnation, without hauing anie regarde at all to our merites or satisfaction.
                  But nowe, seeing that Christ died, the holie Church of Rome may nowe fill him a hood with hay, they may boldlie cast his commaundementes in a corner, and thrust in, in steade of them, their owne ordinances, good intentes, and deuotions, and with spittle, water, ashes and dust, salte and tallowe, oyle and waxe, fire and smoke, shelles and belles, leaping and running, springing and daunsing, satisfie and pay him: hee must take all in good part. Prouided, that men continually make this the foote of their prayers, namelie: Per Christum

Dominum nostrum: for that is the butter that doth better all things. And herewithall he is by and by satisfied and pleased? Haue not the Catholikes then a good and a gentle God, which is content that they pay hi

                  Yet notwithstanding, for that he should not be herewith offended, as though men did mocke with him, because they do make so small account of the breaking of his lawes, they haue to eschew that inconuenience,

                  Is not this well and profoundly philosophied of our mother the holie Church of Rome? I can not thinke, but that the Maister of the Sentences, was somewhere in the bottome of a deep seller, when hee founde out this profounde speculation.

For otherwise it were not possible, that he should haue conceiued these profounde secretes of his owne head. But nowe let vs heare further of the matter.
                  
                     Nowe there is (saith he) a spirituall mariage & a naturall coniunction betwene the man and the woman: and out of that is to be considered, which is a deadlie sinne, and which is a veniall sinne. For euen as the serpent did by persuasion abuse the woman, and the woman the man, euen so it falleth out with vs. For as the inward consent is the serpent, which accepteth the accomplishment of sinne, and so persuadeth the woman, that is the knowledge or least branch of accomplishing: and then, when as by such reasons they are brought to consent to the accomplishing, then it commeth to passe, that the woman doth eate the forbidden fruite, and then presenteth or offereth of the same to the man: and so, when she hath entised the vnderstanding, or principall desire, that it doth giue consent to the same, then hath the man eaten of the forbidden fruit likewise. But nowe, if the full accomplishing remaine sticking in the minde and cogitation, and taketh

not full effect, then it is but a verie small veniall sinne: but when onlie the simple pretence is willing thereto, to witte, the lust and desire of the mind, or thought, without any further full pretence & trauell, to bring the same effectuallie to passe, then hath the woman onelie eaten of the apple, and not the man: who hath by his owne strength subdued his will, that it proceedes not to the performing and finishing of the woorke: and yet in that case it is sometime a deadlie sinne, and sometime a veniall sinne, according to the continuance of the time▪ But if in the meane space there follow a perfect & resolute desire to accomplish the same, then hath the man likewise eaten: principallie in cōsenting resolut

expositions of the Maister of the Sentences: I knowe no other meane for him howe to deale, vnlesse he can find out in one place or other, some subtil Doctour of diuinitie, and make him so much his friend, that hee will helpe him through with the matter: & yet notwithstanding, the principall knowledge and speculation may well be brought to passe and considered, as, That we are not (of dutie) bound to loue God with all our hearts, with all our minde, and with all our might: in such sort, as he by his lawe hath commaunded: seeing that the soule can separate her selfe from him, and so giue ouer her selfe to sinne, and yet not plunge so deepe therein, as to fall throughly into Gods wrath▪ yea, there is great recōpense deserued at Gods hand, when as a man is prouoked to sinne, and to fall from God, & that by his wisedome hee doeth withstand the same: so as the serpent onelie doth eate of the forbidden fruite:In the 7. chap. of ye same dist. vpon the last Can. as the Maister of the Sentences hath in another place written.
                  Therefore it is that our mother the holie Church of Rome hath expounded that which our Sauiour Christ set foorth in the fift Chapter of S. Matthewe, (As to loue

our enimies, not to doe euill for euill, not to desire another mans wife, and such other like sayings more:) after the Pharisaicall manner: As, that it is no speciall commaundement, but onelie a counsell and aduise: and that therefore no man is bounde to obserue and keepe the same, but such as haue professed and vowed chastitie, as Monkes, Ankers, and other such like. Whereby doeth euidentlie appeare, either that GOD hath wholie created and shapen the soule, and hearte of man, or at the least, that his Lawe is not altogeth

                     In the 4.

with knocking vpon the breast, and saying, Peccaui, with holie water, and especially with hearing of a Masse: as for deadly sinnes, the like must be done, but yet with much more force, efficacie, and deuotion. And to say all in all, satisfaction is necessarie and requisite for all sinnes, according to the qualitie and quantitie of the same. And although a man shoulde wholie returne to God, yet can not that helpe, vnles hee make full satisfaction. For whereas these Heretikes doe say, That when soeuer a sinner doeth conuert and repent him of his sinnes, God doth pardon and forgiue him:
                     Ezech. 18.21. 1. Iere. 33.34. Heb. 8.12.10.17. Psal. 103.12. Miche. 7.19. Esaie. 44.22. Iere. 50.20. Eze. 18.24.
                      
                     yea, in such sorte, as he doth wholie forgette the sinnes committed, and casteth them as farre from him, as the East is from the West: yea, and sinketh them down euen into the bottome of the sea: yea, maketh them consume to naught, euen as smoke, or as a cloude, in so much as they are not once more thought vpon, euen like as he doeth also vtterlie forget all the good deedes that a man hath done, which in the end doth giue him selfe to mischiefe.
                  
                  Take heede of that saying, for it smelleth of a faggot. For our mother the holie

Church of Rome hath speciallie concluded, That GOD doeth not forgiue anie sinnes, vnlesse a man doe first make full satisfaction and payment for the same to the vttermost and last farthing: shee can allowe that hee forgiueth the sinne, but not the punishment: and for that cause must hee likewise bee well recompensed, doing after this manner:Christ shoulde pardon the offence, but not the punishmēt. As if a man should pardon his debter all whatsoeuer hee did owe him, and giue him to vnderstande, that hee cancelled his obligation, and in the meane space caused him to be arrested and cast into prison, there to remaine and lie till the whole debte were paide, euen to the vttermost mite. Were not that great mercie vsed, and a liberall pardoning of debters? After that manner will our deare mother the holie Church of Rome haue that remission of sinnes vnderstoode, which wee haue obteined through the bloud and passion of Iesus Christ. For the bloud of Iesus Christ (saieth shee) hath washed away the sinnes: but holie water, the Masse, and such other like satisfactions, doe deliuer vs from the paine and punishement. Or rather, the bloud of IESVS Christ hath troden the path, by the

which Masses, Pilgrimages, Holie water, and other satisfactions may runne post after our Lorde God, to put him in remembrance, to pardon vs of the punishment which we by our sinnes haue deserued. And if they perhaps should come to late, then are the merites of Saintes in a readinesse, to shut vp and make euen the rest of the reckoning and accompt. For our deare mother the holy church of Rome saieth plainlie, by speciall textes of the Scripture, That God doeth neuer clearelie forgiue and pardon the punishment for sinnes, through the merites of the bloud and passion of Christ, without a former satisfaction. For all the Scriptures and examples, which the Lutherans▪
                      and Huguenotes; alledge and bring in, to proue, That God doeth chasten his children with plagues and punishmentes, to the end, to bring them to perfect knowledge and vnderstanding of their miserie and calamitie, and to proue their faith, or that hee will (thereby) bring them from the diuelishe dissimulations of this worlde: all this doeth our deare mother the holie Church of Rome alledge, to proue; that God hath onelie forgiuen them the offence,

but not the punishment: as appeareth by the example of Adam, who although, after his fall, hee receiued comfort againe at Gods hande, yet was hee well punished, euen by bodilie death, and with manie calamities, sorrowes, and troubles, by the which hee made satisfaction.
                  And likewise, take example of the Prophet Dauid, who hauing grieuouslie offended God, and afterwardes returned by repentance, obteined forgiuenesse of his sinnes: and was yet afterwardes, notwithstanding this, sharplie punished, & so forth of manie other examples. For our mother the holie church wil in no wise allow, That God did so punish them, onelie to the ende they should so feele his mightie hande, as they should euer after walke in feare and obedience: and acknowledging their owne weaknesse, should learne with more expedition to call on him for helpe: as the verie words of the scripture do set forth: for that is altogether Caluinistrie: but shee will haue it plaine, That those punishementes were as a raunsome and payement made, wherewith they did paye or satisfie God: and make full recompense

for their faultes and offences: yea, and that they thereby deserued, that such as now call vpon them, shoulde bee released from their punishment. So that it helpeth not now, what soeuer these Heretikes alledge out of the Scripture, to proue, that if God should enter into iudgement with men, by their deedes,Psal. 143.2. Psal. 130.3. Iob. 9.3. Psal. 19.13. Ioh. 15.10.14.4. Psal. 40.1

                      there should be neither end nor measure in punishment: yea, that all the righteousnesse of the holiest men, is nothing else but as a stayned cloth: in so much that their good workes can not in them selues stande in anie steade before the iudgement seate of GOD:Psal. 143.2. Rom. 3.20. Galat. 2.16.
                      howe much lesse are they sufficient to make full satisfaction for sinnes and transgressions? Also, where they saie, that God doth not punishe vs according to the desert of our sinnes,Psa. 103.10.
                      thereby to make full satisfaction for the same, but as a good father

doth chastise his child,Psal. 103.10. Heb. 12.6.7. Iob. 5.17.
                      to the intent he may be warned & amend: & many such like places they bring in, to long to bee rehearsed: for they are all but litterall sentences, and therefore can not serue the purpose of our deere mother the holie Church of Rome.
                  And likewise, whereas these Heretikes doe alledge the theefe hanging vpon the Crosse, to whome Christ did not once make an
                        •
                      mention of satisfaction and recompense: and also of Paule, and of a multitude of such other, which haue obteined only by Gods mere mercie forgiuenesse of their sinnes, through Christ, and for his sake, being pardoned as well of the punishment, as from satisfactiō for the same: for that Christ had not only taken vpō him our sinnes, but likewise the punishment for the same: We passe not a point for all that: for they are all nothing else, but particular & special examples and priuiledges, wherof we will make no account, nor esteeme them for anie perfect rule. For this rule established at the Councell of Trent, must needes remaine stedfast for euer, to witte, that God doeth not pardon any sinne entirely, vnlesse a man haue first made full satisfaction, and suffered condigne and deserued punishment for

the same. And this will we proue wonderfully by an inuincible argument. Heare now a little and mark well, for here the ewe lambs. These Hexetikes must needs (whether they will or no) graunt this, That no mans sinnes are forgiuen him without penance. And now you must consider, That penance is nothing els but a punishment for sinne. For looke, thus the Master of the Sentences doth write: Poenitentia dicitur a puniendo,
                     In the .14. booke of Sent. in the first cap. dist. 
                     qua quis punit illicita quae commisit: that is, Penance commeth of punishment, or pyning, whereby a man doth punish the euill which he hath cō
                        mitted. Ergo, this matter is clere, and the Heretikes catched in a snare. For whereas they will (perhaps) say, to wind themselues out of the nette, That this is a starke lie, & an asseheadly dulnesse, considering that this worde,
                        Poenitentiae.
                      
                     Poenitentia is nothing else in good Latin, but Penitentnesse or repentance: and is deriued, not of the worde Punire, To punish, but of the worde Poenitere, that is to say, Penitent, or sorie: all this can not helpe them. For to that we answere, That our deare mother the holy Church hath nothing to do wt their new heretike Latin, she hath Latin of herself, which is called Monkish

Latin, or Scullarie Latin. In such latin a Spanish chaplein of the Emperour Charles 5. did speak to a Germain at Ausburge, & said: Latinū nostrū non est sicut vostrū, Our Latin & yours is not all one. And therfore it is sufficiēt for vs, that Poenitentia is so to be taken in our Latin, and so it must be, though the Crowe should be no bird. And therfore is this certein, & wtout all doubt, as was cōcluded at the councel of Trent, that whosoeuer wil say,
                     In the .4. sessiō can. 12. de sacramento poenitentiae.
                      
                     that aswell the punishment as the offences are forgiuen, & that ful satisfaction is nothing els but a perfit faith, wherby we faithfully beleue that Christ hath fully satisfied for vs, he is acursed & excōmunicated: so that in cōclusion no sin is forgiuē wtout ful satisfaction. And now cōsidering that so long as we liue, we are neuer assured, whether our satisfaction is of our God fully accepted & allowed, because it may happen that the Receiuers haue kept the same in their hands, or else that our paiments be not currant in heauen: or some other such thing, by reason wherof our tallie should not be allowed by Gods auditors: therefore hath our holy mother, vpō this point cōcluded, That no man can assuredly know, or say, that his sinnes are

forgiuen him, or that he shall be iustified before God without any doubt, or to be assured of his mercie. For this was the determination and conclusion of the holy fathers at Trent, as followeth:
                  
                     Whosoeuer saith▪ that to the remission of sinnes,
                     The councell of Trent. 
                     it is needfull for all men steadfastly to beleeue, that all his sinnes are clearely forgiuen him, not hauing anie doubt of his owne weaknesse and insufficiencie, let him be accursed.
                  
                  
                     Iere. 31.34. Heb. 8, &c. as before.For, notwithstanding that our Lorde hath promised this vnto vs, without anie doubt, and confirmed the same by his promise, that he will (for Christes sake) be our mercifull God and father, and that he will no more thinke vpon our sinnes, but will clearely forgiue and wash away the same, for his owne names sake, and not for any of our desertes: yet may not wee credite him fullie so farre. For, although he say plainely, That he wil not think vpon our sinnes to iudge vs according to the same: yet will the holie Church of Rome haue vs take good heede to the matter, least it should happen and chaunce otherwise: and therefore will haue vs to consider well before hand, and make good prouision of our

merits, and supererogatorie or superfluous good workes, to fill his hand with those, and so to content and please him, as men please children with puppets and counters. Notwithstanding, all that Paule saith,Rom. 8.14.15
                      
                     That all they that are the children of God, haue the spirite of God, and are ledde by him, and he beareth witnes of them, that they are the children of God, and therby they crie, Abba, Father: and saith, That those which haue not this spirite, are not of Christ, considering that all those which are in Christ, and do faithfully beleeue in him, and haue their recourse to him, with perfect and steadfast hope through their beliefe in him:Ephes. 3.22. Ephes. 2.4.4.6 8.
                      and That God who abounds in mercie, hath (through his inestimable loue wherewith he hath loued vs) when we were dead in sin, made vs aliue againe in Christ, through whose mercie wee are beecome holie: yea, and hath raised vs vp againe, and placed vs in the heauens by Christ Iesus, iustifying vs of his meere mercie through faith: not through our selues, but through the gift of God: not by workes, least anie man should boast himselfe: so that from henceforth none can charge or blame the elect of God:
                     Rom. 8.33.34 39.
                     
                     
                     for it is he only which doth iustifie them, who therefore can condemne them, seeing that Christ hath suffered for them? So that they are assured, that neither death, nor life, nor Angel, nor rule, neither might, nor power, neither anie thing present, nor to come, neither hight, nor depth, nor any other creature, can separate them from the loue of God, shewed in Christ Iesus our Lord: With manie such other like thinges which Paule speaketh of. But all that cannot helpe. For our mother the holie Church will haue that vnderstood onely of such,The Councell of Trent, 6. session .9. cap de

to that ende and purpose, hath our deare mother the holie Churche of Rome ordeined the blessed Purgatorie: whereof wee will nowe make further declaration, and proue it to bee as well grounded on the Scripture, as the merits and satisfactions, whereof we haue now alreadie spoken.
               
               
                  The viii. Chapter. VVherein Purgatorie is established, as well bp Scripture as by inheritance. And herein are likewise intreated the remedies and helpes whereby the sillie soules are released out of Purgatorie.
                  HEre is to be considered,Purgatorie, & how soules are redemed out of it. that Purgatorie is founded and hath his ground out of the holie Scripture. For if Masses are founded vpon the Scripture, as wee haue alreadie certi

And now, if it be so, that the Masse of Requiem is founded vpon the Scripture, then no doubt there must needes be a Purgatorie. But nowe let vs bring forth (for the proofe hereof) speciall textes of scripture. First note, howe there is written by Paule to the Corinthians,

This hath our dere mother the holy Church vnderstood, meant, and set forth of Purgatorie: And although out of this it should follow, That all manner of persons (without exception) as wel he Saints as she Saints which our holy father the Pope hath canonized: yea, and the verie Popes themselues shoulde daunse in Purgatorie, as well as Iacke and Tom, with the rest.

certeine space in Purgatorie, & be there broiled and sodden, til such time as they shall (with soule Masses, pardons, or indulgencies) be hailed out of the pan or chaldron, as with a flesh hooke. The which is worthie to bee noted, considering that which is thereout concluded: as first, that (as heretofore is declared) al sinnes are not deadly,In the .7. ca. of the .2▪ parte. neither deserue euerlasting damnation: and then againe, by this you may perceiue that which of late we did speake of: namely,Originall and daily sinnes. That the death and passion of Iesus Christ,In the councell of Trent in the .7. session canon .10. and 14. ses cap. 8. hath purged but onely our originall sinne, and not our daily sinnes, for which wee must make full satisfaction our selues. And whereas the Heretikes say, that Paule doeth not (in the foresaide text) meane any thing at all of Purgatorie,
                        Epiphanius in his booke named Ancir

                           mus, speaking of the doctrine of Trent, saith yt it is the onely foundation, & bringes in this texte of Paule for his purpose. but meanes onely to speake according as the text importeth, & as many ancient fathers haue expounded & vnderstoode the same of the fire of the holy ghost, which doth in time trie & cause to appere plaine all doctrines: namely those which take their foundation of Iesus Christ. And they say that good doctrine and godly learning shal in this proofe remaine stedfast: but babblers and false teachers shall consume like hay, or stubble,

before the fire. With all this we haue nothing to do: for that is but an exposition after the letter, and not after the spirit or allegorie. It is sufficient for vs, that our holie mother the Church of Rome, hath vnderstood Paul otherwise,Reade Eckius and other writers vpon this. Math. 9.23. Luke. 8.52. and applied his text vnto Purgatorie: like as she hath applied the wordes of the Euangelist, where hee saith, That it was a custome amongst the Iewes, to weepe ouer the dead. For therby she hath concluded, That the Iewes did beleue, that there is a Purgatorie, because (as she thinkes) it had bene a great follie of them, to weepe for the dead, vnlesse they did beleeue there was a Purgatorie: so that it is a thing verie credible, that those which wept so sore ouer Steeuen (as in the Acts of the Apostles is declared) did thinke none other,Act. 8.8. but that he was gone into Purgatorie, notwithstanding that he had seene Iesus Christ sitting on the right hand of God the father, and sealed the testimonie and witnesse of him with his bloud. Thirdely, Purgatorie is clearely proued 
                        •
                     ut of the plaine textes of Paule, who saith, That in the name of Iesus al knees do bow,
                     Phil. 2.20. 
                     those that are in heauen, those vpon the earth, and those vnder the earth. Surely we wil

not haue this vnderstoode of diuels: Ergo then it must needs folow, that it is spokē of the souls which lay burning in Purgatorie. For thus saith S. Iohn in the Apocalypse touching the same matter:Apo. 5.13. 
                     And all creatures which are in heauē, & in the earth, & vnder the earth, & in the sea, & all that are in them, heard I, saying, Blessing, honor, & power, be to him that sitteth vpon the seat, & vnto the lambe for euermore. Where vndoubtedly he doth vnderstand & meane Purgatorie, according to the exposition of our deare mother, the holie Church of Rome. And by this you may perceiue, that Pythagoras was not farre different or disagreing in beliefe from the holy Church of Romes beliefe, when as he saide, That mens souls departing from their bodies, did enter into beastes. Considering nowe that Iohn here, and Dauid in other places, do witnes, that the creatures vnder the water: yea, the fishes themselues do laude and praise God, and that the same is vnderstood by our holie mother the Church of Rome, of the soules that be in Purgatorie, she hath not without great appearaunce of trueth concluded,Reade Eckius in his Encheiridion. 
                     That there is likewise a Purgatorie, in the bottome of the Sea:
                     
by which reasons it appeareth, that the soules of drowned men, place themselues in the bowels of fishes. And it is possible that this was the occasion which moued Pythagoras to forbid his scholers the eating of fish: considering specially withall, That S. Patriks purgatorie in Ireland, lies fast by the sea side,S. Patrikes Purgatorie. neare vnto a mountaine called Hecla, where our mother the holie Church of Rome doeth beleeue, that the sillie soules are as ill punished in yse, as in fire. So that by good reason, there might haue bene added vnto the same sentence of Paule, That the trying and shewing openly of the workes of such as build vpon the foundation of Iesus Christ, is not onely by fire,Psal. 66.12.

We haue passed thorough fire and water. And Virgil the wise Poet, which had so good vnderstanding of the sacrifice of the Masse, as is declared before, hath likewise placed Purgatorie by a Sea,In the .6. booke of A

Purgatorie, with all the paines and torments, which the soules doe suffer, so perfectly and well, that a man would thinke that our deare mother the holie Church of Rome, hath kindeled her Purgatorie with his fire, tongs, and bellowes. Insomuch that our Catholike Doctors did not amisse when they proued their Purgatorie,

                      by the authoritie and testimonie of Virgil. Now, if it were so, that there were no Scripture to proue Purgatorie by,
                        Virgils purgatorie. yet would the inheritance and possession of it, teache vs sufficiently, that there is a Purgatorie. And therefore we neede not to trouble our selues much, with bringing out the booke of the Machabies for a witnesse, and thereby cause the Heretikes to mocke and ieast at vs. For they say, that that booke is so farre off from being allowed for an authentike booke of holie Scripture,Machab. 15.29.40. that the writer and Authour of the same, did desire to bee pardoned and borne withall, if hee had not written so sufficiently as he ought. And men may further consider, what account is to bee made of his writings, seeing hee did so greatly praise one Razis, who ripped out his owne vowelles and liue him selfe,2. Machab. 14 43.46. because he woulde not fall

into the handes of his enimies: which vnvndoubtedly was a detestable deede, and directly against Gods commaundement. They declare likewise,Reade what Eusebius of Meliton writeth in the 4. booke of his histories. capit. 26, And read Augustine in his 2. booke against Gandenuum. ca. 23. and Hierom in his prologue vpon the Machabies. that neither by Christ, & his Apostles, nor by the whole cō

And yet they say beeside this, that if they shoulde accept that Booke, yet is there nothing written therein touching Purgatorie, but onely a praying for the deade, in respect of the resurrection, and not in anie respect of satisfaction by Purgatorie. And therefore wee will not breake our heades greatly about this matter, but will establishe our Purgatorie strongly, by inheritaunce and possession.
                  Besides that, I leaue the Priestes purses vnspoken of, which is a souereigne, soking, and a drawing Purgatorie, as euerie man may both say and feele. And yet besides this,The Iegenda aurea and the Vi

our dere mother the holy Church of Rome, and many yeares of pardon giuen & graunted to all those which vpon that day doe deuoutly visite the Chantrie priests & Masses of Scala Coeli, vsing their purses liberally for that purpose, and to haue a trentall of Masses, a sackfull of seuen Psalmes, and three or foure pokes packt with Pater nosters, and Ane Maries, all well measured & filled, whereof to make a present to the sillie soules in Purgatorie, for that is euen fitte meat for their mouthes: and they are as wel refreshed with those dainties, as though they were wrapped about the head with a wet clout in a cold morning. And yet beside all this, the holie Churche of Rome hath sought all maner of meanes & wayes to refresh, coole, & ease the pain of the silly poore soules, which lie in the great heat of Purgatorie gaping for aire, as a Carpe doeth for water:All these. 15. helpes and remedies you shal finde euen as they are here written in the booke called Sermones discipuli de tempore & de sanctis, cum Promptuario ex▪

                      all which meanes she hath digged out of the holy Scriptures.
                  For, to beginne, she hath appointed burning Candles, which must bee set vppe to light the poore soules in the darke places of Purgatorie: because it is written, Christ is the true light, and whosoeuer doeth followe him, walketh not in darkenesse.
                     
And therefore hath our holie mother practised, that at euerie corner of the hearse, a candle shalbe set burning for that the dead should be forgiuen and pardoned of foure sundrie manner of sinnes: which hee hath committed, to witte, in thinking, in speaking, in doing, and in suffering.
                  Secondarilie, she doeth succour the poore sillie soules with censing: for thereby they are released of the horrible stinke which is in Purgatorie.
                  Thirdlie, shee doeth relieue them with holy water, which must be deuoutly sprinkled vppon their graues, with a sprinkle, that thereby they may be cooled and refreshed of the great and extreame heate of the fire: for it is written: Asperges me Domine Hysopo: Thou shalt sprinkle mee (O Lord) with Hysope: which is to bee vnderstood, that the Parson or Curate, shal all to water my graue with a holy water sprinkle. For you may well consider, th6at Dauid was dead and buried, when he spake these wordes, and his soule was in Purgatorie: otherwise, our deare mother would not sing this dailie in the name of the soules departed.
                  Therefore must this holie water needes

as much profit them, as a couple of Egge shelles: which is apparant by the holie Scripture. For it is written in the Gospel of S. Luke, That the riche man, when hee laie burning in Hell, did require onelie a drop of water, to coole his tongue. Then consider nowe, if a droppe of water can succour and helpe the soules that lie in Hell, how much more shal the sweet holie water coole the soules that lie in Purgatorie, when it is so swashed and dashed ouer all the graue with a swinging holie water sprinkle?
                  Fourthlie, they are greatlie relieued by the offering of bread and wine: for through the might of such an acceptable offering, the soules are fedde and refreshed of God.
                  Fiftlie, with Vigils, of three, sixe, and nine lessons, with De profundis, with Requiescant in pace: and with such other like pleasaunt songes, as Iob and Dauid soung, when they lay in Purgatorie. For our deare mother the holie Church of Rome hath applied all such matters vnto Purgatorie.
                  Sixtlie, they are relieued by fatte offerings: for that the soules are maruellous

glad, when the Priestes get manie offerings. And in deede, it is a most sweet morsell for their mouthes.
                  Seuenthlie, with praying to he Saintes and she Saintes, and with singing of Letanies, D

                     riges, & Ryrieleesons: for there are manie and great indulgencies graunted vnto them.
                  Eightlie, with fasting & kneeling. For there is a plaine texte in the decrees, which saith, That the fasting of the liuing, is the hope of the dead.
                  
                  Ninthely, when men do pay for them such debtes as they left vnpaied.
                  Tenthly, when men do for them workes of mercie, and especiallie when they are done by Priestes, Monkes, or Friers.
                  The xi. when their executours accomplishe and fulfill their last willes, and testamentes, especiallie if they haue vequeathed any thing, either monie or lands, to anie Abbie or Cloister.
                  The xii. when anie man shall doe for them such penance as they haue left vndone when it was enioyned them by their ghostlie fathers.
                  The xiii. when anie man perfourmeth for them such vowes of pilgrimages,

and other like deuotions, as they made in their life time, and yet haue not kept them.
                  The xiiii. when men do pardon & forgiue them such offences, as they haue committed against anie person or persons, hee or shee, in their life time.
                  The last reliefe, and the best of all, is, when men cause Masses to be soung or said for them: for that is farre aboue all remedies, because it is a goodlie drawing plaister, which hath not power onelie to drawe soules out of Purgatorie, but also to picke monie out of mens purses. And that same Requiem aeternam beeing three times soung in the Masse, is such a pleasant medicine, that (in a moment) it doeth cleane take away all the paine and griefe which the soules suffer, and bringeth them fast asleepe like dormice, in so much that they feele no more smart, neither at the stomache, nor in the backe: yea, and though that their bladder were puft vppe like a Cowes vdder, so that they had not the power to pisse a plumb stone, yet with that medcine they should in the twinkling of an eye, be as sounde as a rotten apple.
                  And yet nowe, besides all these good & wholesome meanes before specified, the

good & holie Nonnes of Leydē
                      in Holland,
                     Nonnes of Leyden in Holland. and all other Couentes of that profession, found out an other helpe of great importance: for euerie day, betweene Michaelmasse and All Saints, after that the Vigils of ix. lessons be song, then goeth the Mother or Prioresse of the Cloister into a darke chamber, with a great rodde in her hande, and then come the Nonnes in thither one after another starke naked, euerie one alone, & turne vp their bare buttockes: yea, some of them as naked as my naile, & so lie downe before the Prioresse, and there receiue holie discipline for the soules in Purgatorie: for, for euerie ten girkes that one of them doeth so receiue, there is a soule deliuered out of Purgatorie, and flies vp into heauen without anie staie. Is not this nowe a goodlie matter? I beleeue verilie, that all the rest of the Nonnes of other professions will doe the like, though it were but euen for good manner sake, and that the Father or Patrone of the Cloister doth vse to execute the office manie times, when the Prioresse is sicke, or otherwise earnestlie occupied.
                  And nowe (besides all this) Durandus writeth, That euerie Sunday and holie

day, the soules do play. For seeing that God hath commaunded, that on the Sabbaoth day al people should rest from their labour:
                     Soules do rest and play on Sundayes and Holidayes. 
                     it is great reason, that the sillie soules shoulde be relieued of their paines on those dayes. In consideration wherof, it appeareth a maruellous charitable deede of our deare mother the holie church of Rome, to haue instituted so many holie dayes (beside Sundayes) & commanded them to be solemnely kept, because the soules may vppon those dayes rest themselues, and go a playing: for that it is to be thought, that they obserue as well the preceptes of the holie Church, as Gods commandements: otherwise they were no better than Lutherans. And now we know verie wel, that there commeth no Lutheran into Purgatorie: for Purgatorie is only for the good Catholikes which hold fast on the church of Rome. So that it is verelie to be thought, that the poore soules are as well holpe vp wt so many idle holy daies, as with the Nonnes discipline on their bare arsses: yet it is to bee considered, that albeit this, they must be praied for on Sundaies & other Holie daies, as well as on the worke daies, when they lie scortching & scalding

in Purgatorie: for that hath our mother the holie church speciallie commanded, being therevnto moued by the example of a good fat Abbat,In the .7. booke in tit. de officio mortuorum. nu. 2. who (as Durādus saith) because he had forbidden his Monkes, to pray for the soules in Purgatorie, vpon Sundaies & Holy dayes, but onlie vpon worke daies, he was vpon a time (by the poore soules) catched, & verie sore beaten & wounded, & by that meanes forced to reuoke & breake his former order & cōmandment. And surelie, that was but reason: for although the sillie soules haue some playing daies, yet I assure you they paie full dearelie for it at other times.This is copied in a manner woorde for woorde out of the booke called Sermones discipuli de tempore, & de sanctis, cum promptuario exemplorum in the .160. Sermon of the soules. For the paines which they suffer there, are so extreme, that our Doctours write for a trueth, That there was a soule which had lien 30. yeres in Purgatorie, & at last, there came an Angel, who did bid the soule choose, whether it would tarie yet one short Winters day in Purgatorie, or that it would returne into the worlde againe, and there doe a maruellous hard penance, to witte, for one long hundred yeares space, shoulde goe barefoote, and treade still vppon sharpe yron nailes, eate nothing else but browne bread, and drinke bitter gall mingled with vinegre,

and weare a cloth made of Camels haire next the skinne, & a stone vnder the head in place of a pillowe. This soule did choose much rather to doe all that same harde penance in earth, than to tarie one daie longer in Purgatorie. Consider nowe what a sharpe biting sauce mustard is: for as it is written in the Decrees: There is no earthlie paine, or martyrdome, to be compared to the paines of Purgatorie: yea, that holie man Thomas de Aquino saith,

                     That the paine of the fire of hell, and the fire of Purgatorie, is all one, and that they differ nothing at all, but that the one is but temporall, and the other is eternall. So that it was not without iust occasion, that Virgil set a partition of yron,
                        Aeneid. libro. 6. and other metall betweene those two fires: although some men be of opinion, that the partition was but a pale made of wainscote, which (because it was of wood) was long agoe burnt away:Hell and Purgatory both but one kitchen. so that nowe Hell and Purgatorie enter in both at one hole, and are both but one fire. Which is the occasion that some take vpon them to say, that The fire of Purgatorie is pist out: although there be other learned men, which bring in another occasion, whereby it is happened,

that there is now no partition betweene Hell and Purgatorie, but that they are ioyned together. For it is written in a certen historie:This is writtē in the Apologie of Barnard. O

                     That there was a good holie Pope, which was verie desirous to know of his Secretarie, being a good wittie & learned man, whether (as he thought) he might giue a general pardon at once,
                     The Pope and his Secretarie commen of indulgencies & pardons. 
                     for all such soules as were then in Purgatorie, and ioyntlie withall pardon alike all such as should hereafter be condemned thither: so that after, there shoulde be no more neede of Purgatorie. Whervpon his Secretarie did demaund of him this question againe: Whether hee did not verilie thinke, that if it were so, that he had such power, if he did not thē verely beleeue, that all his Pope predecessours haue had the like authoritie in their time? Wherevnto the Pope answered, Yes surelie, considering that all his power and authoritie came from them. Then the Secretarie did demaunde of him againe: Whether that of so manie Popes, and holie Fathers, which had possessed that place before him, there were not one of them so mercifull and louing towardes the poore soules,

that had taken vppon him to doe that charitable deed, if his power did so farre extend? Vnto this the Pope answered, As touching that, he knewe not. Wherevpon the Secretarie gaue him a full resolution, saying, I can tell then certeinlie: Once our Lord Iesus Christ, chief Bishop of all Bishops, & Pope aboue all Popes, had full power and authoritie to doe the same, for that he was almightie: and hee had also the will to doe it, for that he was most mercifull: and did likewise beare an infinite affection and loue vnto all mankind, in so much that he did effectuallie and fullie accomplish that matter. So that it is not needful for anie man to trouble him self anie more about that matter, seeing hee hath (by offering vp of his bodie) obteined a pardon of God the Father, and sealed the same for euermore, with his owne pretious bloud for the redemption of all faithfull soules,
                     Christes indulgence and pardon for all christen soules. 
                     past, present, or to come. So that nowe there falles no more condemnation or iudgement vpon them, neither shall they neede to feare Death, Hell, nor Purgatorie, but depart out of this life directlie into euerlasting life, as he him selfe doeth

plainlie testifie by Iohn the Euangelist in his Gospell.

                  Nowe see,Purgatorie condemned. out of this will some men mainteine, That Purgatorie is cleane taken away, euer since this great and generall pardon came: in so much that diuelles are come to dwel there, & haue now brought Hell and Purgatorie all into one kitchen, where they broile their soules, and turmoile them at their pleasure. And for that likewise, that good Catholike Doctour Barnardus de Bustis doeth defende this case with the testimonie and witnesse of Gregorie: That the fire of Hell and Purgatorie are kindled together, saying, Nam (vt inquit Gregorius) sub eodem igne electus purgatur, & damnatus crematur: that is to say, For (as Gregorie saith) with one fire are the elect purged,
                     In his booke called Rosarium, in the 3. part the 2. sermon. 
                     and the damned burned. And therefore it is, that our deare mother the holie Church, in the prayer called, Offertorium, which she singeth commonlie vpon All Soules day, & in the Anniuersarie, doth put no difference betwixt Hell and Purgatorie: for these are the wordes which shee doeth vse:
                  
                     Domine Iesu Christe, Rex gloriae, libera animas omnium fidelium defunctorum

de manu inferni,
                     
                        Offertorium on all Soules day 
                     & de profundo lacu, libera eas de ore leonis, ne absorbeat eas tartarus, sed signifer S. Michael repraesentet eas in lucem sanctam, &c. That is to say:
                  
                     O Lord Iesu Christ, King of glorie, deliuer thou all faithfull soules out of the power of hel, and out of that deepe lake: deliuer them out of the mouth of the lion, that they sinke not downe into hell, but that thy standard bearer Saint Michael may bring them into that holie light, &c.
                  
                  Wherein they nowe plainlie call Purgatorie, Hell. And in an other Collect, which they doe sing vpon the same daye, they call it, Regiones tenebrarum, that is to say, The region, or place of darknesse, praying vnto God, that S. Michael will or may doe so much, as to deliuer them from thence. In summe, they make but one hole, and one lake of those twaine. Howsoeuer it happeneth, whether the pale that was betweene them be burnt, or that Purgatorie is pist out, I wote not, it is to profounde a question for vs, and therefore we will commit the disputation of that matter to the Doctours of Louen: They may (perhaps)

tipple out a flaggon of wine or twaine, in the matter, before they agree vppon it. It is inough for vs, that we haue proued Purgatorie sufficientlie, not onelie by plaine textes of holie Scripture, but also by inheritance and possession, and so established it, as there is nothing to bee saide against it.

Nowe therefore I wil send them the Epistle of Paul to the Colossians,Colos. 1.24. where they shall find, that Paul saith thus, Now ioy I in my sufferings, which I suffer for you, and fulfill that which is behinde of the passions of Christ in my flesh: for his bodies sake which is the congregation. Alway prouided, that they shal not vnderstand nor interpret this text after their mindes, nor after the letter: to wit, as though Paul did meane nothing els, but that he (as a member of Christes body) doeth followe Christ his head, in suffring for the loue of the congregation, and strengthening of the same: for this interpretation is hereticall, & doth not wel agree with the interpretation and beleefe of our deare mother the church of Rome. But they must know & confesse, that Paules meaning in that place is, that the passion of Christ is not sufficient to satisfie for all our sins, which we haue cōmitted since: for those must euery man make satisfaction for by good workes & pardons, & wt bulles & indulgencies: for to that end serue the merites of such Saints, as haue bin canonized by Popes, and the bloud of

                     Math. 16.19. which are to bee vnderstood, the keies of the chest before mentioned,This standeth likewise plainly set foorth in the said glosse, and is confirmed by all those Catholike doctors. wherin that rich tresure is shut vp, which can neuer be emptied nor diminished: for if it were possible, that all the people of the worlde did go to Rome in one yeare of Iubilie,
                     
that euerie man might receiue full indulgence and pardon, yet should the same chest be no more emptied thereby, than the Ocean sea should be, with taking out of it one spoonefull of water: or Saint Goddards mountaine be diminished, by taking from it one handfull of sand: as is plainly sette forth by a verie trimme and fine verse, as followeth:
Mille licèt sumant, deperit inde nihil.
                  
                  That is to say:

                        Thogh thousands take & none said nay:
                        Yet nothing wastes or weares away.
                     
                  
                  And now, how necessarie and profitable this is, to our holie mother the Church of Rome, it doth appeare plainly out of this, That onely the indulgencies, with the letters of pardon,In the booke called defensio Parisien. Curiae pro libertate ecc. Gal. Ludouico. 11. oblato aruc. 77. and the Reseruationes pectorales, mentales, regressus generales, & speciales accessus, with such other like trifles mo, are worth to the Pope of Rome in France onelie, aboue two hundred thousand Crownes a yeare: so that through all Christendome, it doth amount to aboue ten millions of Crownes, which is a prettie summe.
                  But what shoulde I talke much of the Pope? It is not long agoe, that a simple

gray frier called Samson of Millan, being by Pope Leo, 10. appointed (amongst other) for one of the gatherers or receiuers of the monie for Bulles and Indulgencies, had within a little space, gotten so much monie for himselfe, that he did offer to giue a hundred and twentie thousand Ducats in redie monie,120000. Ducates offered to be made Pope. to be chosen Pope. In summe, all indulgencies, pardons, iubilies, & buls, with the rest of the Popes authoritie, are lightly to be proued and declared by scripture, if men will vnderstand them rightly, and according to the exposition of our deare mother the holy Church.

And againe, here is not to be vnderstood by Peter, the person of Peter the Apostle: but in the name of Peter, are our holy Fathers (the Popes) pointed vnto, as with a wette finger. For whereas the heretikes will say, that Peter was neuer at Rome, it is a stark lie. See I pray you their follie: well, his head & bones lie there yet at this present in a golden chest. And yet besides that,S Peters historie of Rome not only his Legend, but likewise that holy man Lippomanus, & the booke called Speculū historiale, that is, The Mirror of histories made by Vincentius Lirinensis, do perfectly set forth,

that Paule, iust a yeare before, was put to death: yea, after that he himselfe had bene Pope, and gouerned that sea 25. yeares, by the same token that his seate which was hewed out of a Purphyre stone, and the Albe wherein hee song his first Masse, do both remaine yet for a memoriall. And although Saint Luke doe testifie,Read the Actes of the Apostles where is treated of Cornelius the captaine of the councell at Hierusalē, of Peters imprisonment, and in many other places. that hee continued verie long at Hierusalem: yea, and that in the verie same time that hee shoulde haue bene in Rome, by the reckoning and calculation of our deare mother the holie Church of Rome: and that Paul doth seeme to agree with the same, where he writeth, that the time that he lay in prison in Rome, there was not one of the faithfull that did visite or assist him: I leaue to say, that Peter shoulde then haue beene Pope: but all this cannot persuade vs. For that is to bee answered, that Saint Luke might be ouerseene in his writing, and I thinke he was no good Arithmetician: or else we may say (as diuers Lutherans them selues confesse,) that one bodie may bee in two, or three, or mo sundrie places, at one time. And touching that, he had perhappes forgotten that Peter was Pope of Rome: as is apparant by that he writeth to the

                     Galathians, where he saieth,Gal. 10.2.7.8. That Peter was appointed for an apostle to the Iewes, and he himselfe to the Gentiles. Or else it may well be answered, that it was not decent for Peter, beeing a Prince and Duke ouer all the Apostles, to go seeke or visite such a simple fellow as Paule was, lying in prison:Gregorie. 7.

I let alone that he would once step a foote to go meete him,This do all the Catholike doctours write, & many old histories, which yet notwithstāding do not agree among them selues, so that there may be false heades amongest them as it seemeth. being in the meane space passing his time & dallying with his Curtesans, and with the Dutchesse Matildis, who yet at last did make intercession for the Emperour. Wherefore, is it not to bee thought then, that Peter did likewise stand vpon his grauitie and reputation, without much going to the prison, to seeke Paule, or visite him? Especially considering, howe

busie he was to appoint and set new Prelates in euerie place. For it might perhaps be, that Peter was not verie well at ease, or diuerse other occasions might cause it.

And that this is wel founded vpon scripture, it is apparant by the wordes of the saide Anacletus, who doth bring in (for verefying of his saying) plaine textes out of the Psalmes, to witte, Moses and Aaron with their Priestes. For out of that is forceablie concluded (as hee saieth) that the Pope of Rome is the head of the Church. Is not that well shot, God saue the marke. Also the holie Apostles (saieth hee) did

debate and determine amongest themselues (as I thinke at that time, when they did striue who should be chiefe amongst them) that the Bishop of euerie Countrie shoulde knowe, who should bee next vnder him: for notwithstanding, that they were all Apostles alike, yet did Christ giue that vauntage to Peter, that he shoulde bee chiefe of the Apostles, and so named him Cephas,
                     How Christ wil led his apostles to vse thēselues in bearing rule one ouer another: You shall find in Luk. 22 25.26. Mat. 20.25.26. Mar. 10.42.45. Iohn. 1.42. that is to say, The chiefe head or Prince of the Apostles. See now, this is the exposition of our deare mother the holie Church of Rome, vpon these woordes of Christ: Thou art Cephas. And yet it is true, that Cephas is a worde of the Chaldee tongue, and doth not signifie A heade, but A stone: as Petra doth in the Greeke, or Latin: for so S. Iohn the Euangelist him selfe doeth expounde it. But notwithstanding that, seeing it hath pleased our deare mother the holie Church of Rome, to vnderstand it so, considering that this worde Cephas, or Cepha, doeth signifie in the Chaldee tongue, A stone, & the like worde in maner, in the Greeke, and in the French tongue, doth signifie A head, as to wit, Cephali, or Cheff, therfore it is good reson that we take the exposition of Iohn as literall, &

repose our selues vpon the exposition of our deare mother the holie Church: who onely in deede, hath the power and authoritie, to interprete the Scripture spiritually, and allegorically.

                  And out of this we haue to note two principall pointes. The first is, that the holie Church hath such power and authoritie, that she can (not onely) chaunge the bread into flesh, but is able to make of a stone a head, & as well transubstantiate the wordes as the bread. The second is, that a man may make a good similitude or parable, vpon the neerenesse of names in speache, which in pronuntiation doe sound one like another, as the holie Church hath concluded herevpon,

                     That Christ came to fulfill the will of his father. For of that must needes follow, That all good Christen men are bound to fulfil the will of their holie mother the Church of Rome, of which church the Pope (without all doubt) is the supreme heade. And againe, God speaketh by the mouth of his Prophete Esaias: But doth the axe boast it selfe against him that heweth therewith? Or doeth the sawe make anie bragging against him

that ruleth it? Signifying thereby, that the king of the Assyrians had no power against the almightie God, who woulde vse him as an axe, or a sawe, to punish and correct his people by him. Out of this hath our mother the holy Church of Rome concluded, and (as she saith) made it appeare clearer than the Sunne, that there is no power nor authoritie in this worlde, but in the power of the holy sea & pope of Rome, to correct or punish the same. And this shee doeth establish yet more strongly, by the wordes of Paule, who saith: That the naturall man cannot conceiue nor vnderstand Gods doings: but the spirituall man doth vnderstand & rule all things, but may not be ruled of any man. For this doth the holie Church vnderstand by the pope of Rome,Boniface. 18. in the Extrauagantes, trac

Now further, his power is established in the first booke of Moses called Genesis, where it is written, That God in the beginning did shape both heauen and earth. For now, that is as much to say (after the exposition of the holie Church of Rome) that the Pope is the beginning of all things. Considering

there is no mention made but of one beginning. It is not said: In the beginning,
                     This doth the Pope Boniface the .8. write in his Extrauag, Tractat. de maiorita

                      as of mo or manie beginnings: and therefore whosoeuer should compare the Emperour to be as good as the Pope, he is a rank heretike & of the sect of the Manichees, who saide, There was mo beginnings of all things than one. What thinke you now of this? Is not this a good bagpipe to play a galiard vpon? But now, tarie yet a little, it is likewise writen,Two greate lightes. 
                     That God did shape two great lightes, a greater and a lesser: which do signifie (after the interpretation of the holy Church) that the pope of Rome is aboue all other Potentates, & aboue the Emperour: for he is the Sunne, & the Emperour is the Moone. Whereby nowe is clearely to be seene, that Moses had a foreknowlege of the pope & his authoritie. And Iob must needes haue had some feeling of his cōming. For thus God said vnto Iob:Iob. 38.33. This interpretation with the other two following are worthily written in the glosse of the decretals in the Cap antiquorum ext. de poenitentia & r

                     Knowest thou (I pray thee) how the heauens are gouerned? Or canst thou rule him vpon earth? That is (after the interpretation of the holy Church) That euen as in the heauen one eternall God doth gouerne all things, and as the holy Trinitie is brought to one onelie vnitie:

The like consequence must fall out here vpon earth. So that here the Pope onely must haue dominion ouer all estates, dukedomes,
                     The Pope aboue all kings. 
                     kingdomes, & other whatsoeuer, in consideration that hee is the onely line, leuell, and compasse, whereby all other people are and ought to be directed. And in consideration hereof is the prophesie of Paul thus vnderstood, saying: Vntil the fulnes of the Gentils be come,
                     Ro. 11.25.26. 
                     and then shall all Israel be saued: ioining this, with that which Christ said: So that there shalbe but one flock,
                     Iohn. 10.16. 
                     & one sheepheard: as to vnderstand, When all the nations vpon earth, shall be subiect to the Pope. Like as now in our daies we haue seene a good beginning, & do daily see with our eyes very great apperāce of more. And that the Pope ought not only to haue a spirituall gouernment as a Bishop: but must likewise maintein a worldly gouernment, as a king, is by clere testimonie of Scripture of our deare mother the holy Church approued.The Pope is a king. For there is without doubt, a plaine text,This you shall find in the text before alleged of the decretals. ff. in hac ext. de maioritate & obedientia.
                      that the Apostles did say: Behold here are two swordes. Wherevnto Christ answered not, saying: That it was too manie, but that, that was inough.
                     
Now out of this doth our deare mother cō
                     clude, That the Pope of Rome must vse two swordes, to wit, a spirituall, & a temporall sword. Ho ball, ho how will this sound in the eares of the Heretikes?
                  But now must they vnderstand for a speciall matter, that a good while ago there was in Spaine an honest man, who coulde not vnderstand it so, saying that this scripture did serue nothing at al to that purpose. And by and by, the holy inquisition (which is the dearest and chiefest nourse & fosterfather of the Church of Rome) did take him, and burne him at a stake, as one which had highly blasphemed: because that vpon his opinion should follow, that the holy church hath not full power to interprete the scripture as she will: which I assure you is a terrible slaunder.
                  Therefore haue these heretikes need to looke well to the matter, & kepe their tongues, & giue eare to other testimonies and witnesses. For yet besides this, Christ said to Peter: Put vp thy sword into the sheth.
                     In the extrauagants de maiori. & obedi. and is likewise so concluded in the councell of Reines. Out of those words doth plainly appeare (as our holy father Bonifacius the 8. saith) That both the swordes, as well the temporall, as the spirituall, are vnder the

power and iurisdiction of the Church, Yea, and it is verie necessarie, that the one sword be subiect to the other: which is to be vnderstood, That the temporal iurisdiction and authoritie must be subiect to the spirituall & ecclesiasticall power and authoritie. For (according to the saying of S. Paule) There is no power or authoritie, but that which is appointed by God. Truely (saith he) there would be no good regiment, if the one sword were not subiect to the other: and that the lower and inferiour were (by some good meanes) brought in subiection and obedience to the higher and superior. Consider, this is the onely naturall and grounded interpretation of the before alledged text of the holie Scripture, as our deare mother the holy Church hath interpreted the same, word by word. Is not this Popingaie then trimly shot downe? Lee these Huguenots, and Lutherans come out now, who crie alway that we cannot establish the power & authoritie of the Pope by anie scriptures: now they may see, that we haue scriptures

For this is the verie text, that the holy fathers assembled at the coūcell of Carthage, were chiefly perswaded by to giue speciall commandement, That no cōmon or simple Priest shoulde take vpon him to doe any such thing. Was not that (I pray you) a matter of importance to consult vpon? And yet besides this, it is there written: I am the vine, you are the branches▪ he that remains in me & I in him, shall bring forth much fruit, which the holy Church vnderstanding of the pope, hath resolutely cōcluded, That no man may consecrate or hallow any Church, but he alone. Think you not that they had great reason so to do?

Yea, moreouer, he may (if it be his pleasure) depose, deface, and blotte out of the Kalendar, and register, such as haue bene a long time canonized and worshipped: as did appeare by Pope Boniface the 8. who caused Saint Herman of Ferrare, to bee digged out of his graue and burnt, after he had bene taken

and esteemed for a Saint more than twentie yeeres. And that which is more, wee finde written, That Pope Clement the fift (about the yeere of our Lorde, 1309.) did charge and commaunde the Angels, through his Popish authoritie & power, that they should take the soules of all such, as comming in pilgrimage towardes Rome, did die by the way, and forthwith carie them into heauen without anie delay or tarrying, or without letting them once smell the fire of Purgatorie: as appeareth by his Bulles herevpon granted and made: whereof diuerse copies doe (at this day) lie at Vienne, at Limoges, and at Poytiers, townes in France, in the chestes where the priuiledges of the same Townes are kept. Wherefore then I pray you) should not wee willinglie accept him for all our wealth and honour, seeing hee can canonize, make, and vnmake hee Saintes and shee Saintes: and hath likewise power ouer the Angels of heauen?

Which thing also was before spoken by the Prophete Daniel, That hee should lift and set vp him selfe aboue all Godhead, and should speake maruelous things against God, and do euerie thing after his owne lust: placing him selfe aboue all things in the worlde: distributing landes and kingdomes, euen as hee best list and will.

For now, to answere that, where hee saith: After that I shalbe lifted vp from the earth, I will drawe all things vp after me: that is thus to bee vnderstood, (saieth the holie church of Rome) That Christ after his ascension into heauen, should take al Kingdomes, Dukedomes, and such like out of the possession of Kings, Dukes, &c. and that by meanes of his souldiers, especiallie by his Romishe Apostles. And whereas in other places hee doeth forbid his Disciples to seeke after,Matth. 10.

                        orth the life of Alexander the 3.) for then endeth that determination. And that was the cause why the Popes beganne to trauell with a deliberate intention, to make a diuision of the Imperiall crowne of Rome, who then had the East and West countrie of Greece, and almost the whole world in subiection: as Pope Alexander 3. did plainlie acknowledge vnto the Embassadors of Emanuel Emperour of Graecia,
                     
declaring plainlie, That hee in no wise would haue the Empire of Graecia & the Empire of Rome vnited or ioyned together againe in one: which was done especiallie to the intent that hee might bee the better able to ouerrule them both.
                  
                     Fredericke the 2. deposed by Gregorie the 9. in anno. 4.And out of that it doth likewise growe, that Gregorie the ninth, and Innocentius the fourth, Popes of Rome, did depose the Emperour Fredericke the second, and absolued his subiectes of their othe which they had taken and made vnto him: and aboue that, did excommunicate and banishe all such his subiectes, as did remaine faithfull and true vnto him. And furthermore, graunted great indulgence and pardon to such as would rebelliouslie rise vppe to destroy and confound them. And yet besides all this, after that hee (with the summe of an hundred and twentie thousand markes of golde in weight) had redeemed and set free him selfe out of the excommunication of the said Pope Gregorie, yet was hee (notwithstanding that) once againe accursed and banished.

                      In so much that Henrie Lantgraue of Thuringe was chosen Emperour: and after his death,

(which was verie sudein) the Imperiall crowne was giuen to one William then Earle of Hollande:
                     Emperour William countie of Holland slaine by the Freeses. who verie shortlie after that, was by the Freeses slaine. After whose death the Empire did remaine seuentene yeres complete without head or Emperour.
                  And yet I pray you, consider: Do wee not finde by all perfect histories, that Pope Vrbane the fourth,
                        Vrbane. 4. did about the yeere of our Lorde 1264. violentlie dispossesse Conradinus sonne to Conrade,
                     
                        Conradinus king of Sicilia.
                      then Emperour of the kingdome of Sicilia, notwithstanding the same, did by iust title of inheritance apperteine vnto him, and gaue the same to Charles Earle of Angiou de Prouince, and brother to Lodo

                  Nowe to deface that deede and intent, Pope Nicholas the third about the yeere of our Lorde 1268. caused Peter the King of Aragon,

And not long before this, about the yeare of our Lorde. 1466. Pope Paule 2. had deposed by sentence George the naturall king of Boemia, from his said kingdome,Pope Paul. 2. frankely did giue away the kingdome of Boemia, but vpon mad conditions. and giuen the same to the Dukes of Germanie: marie with this condition, that they should go and take it perforce, at their own cost and charges: in which attempt they lost aboue an hundred thousand men, both horsemen and footemen, and yet did preuaile verie little. For such presentes and gifts, are of the nature of his Bishoprikes of Hierusalem, and other townes in Turkie, which he giues to this man and that man, whereof the Bishops neuer inioy anie more, but the bare title, which they haue well wrapped vp in a Bull of a sheep skin surely sealed.

                     Anacletus, and the holie Church of Rome: vnderstanding the matter thus, That the Priests are to be esteemed as the very changers & sellers in the Church, who do vtter their merchandize so deare, that the sight of them (manie times) will stand a man dearer, than the best ware that the Habardashers of Paris and Lions haue in their shoppes. And although other chaungers of monie, and vsurers,

did inioy the benefites of the like priuiledge, as well as the Priests, to witte, that they were with the same whipping driuen out of the temple: yea, and although dogs be sometime vsed after the same manner: yet, considering that the Priestes are my white sonnes, and must haue somewhat the more preeminence and aduauntage, specially for that their merchaundize are of more estimation than the rest, and their incense of better smell than the incense that the dogges smother abroade in the Church. Insomuch that the holie Church of Rome doeth vnderstande this by the priests onelie, to wit, that temporall Magistrates or Officers, shall haue no iurisdiction ouer them, considering well, that Christ had them in such estimation as he himselfe onelie woulde whippe them out of the Church. And yet hath shee more strongly established the same, by the plaine Texte of the Prophete Dauid, where it is written,Psal. 81.1.6. This procedeth forth after, in the said epistle of Anacletus.
                      
                     God stoode in the middest of the Gods, that is to say, of Priests and Prelats. Againe, I haue said, All you are Gods. Now truth it is, that the whole Psalme doeth (after the letter) speake of Kings and Gouernours of this

world: yet notwithstanding, our deare mother the holie Church, hath vnderstood the same wholy of the Priestes and Spiritualtie, according to the spirit, and that specially by reason of sixe weightie causes: to witte:
                  First, because the whole text doth conclude, as well, or rather much better, vpon the Priestes, than vpon anie other: for it is written, That will not vnderstād, but will walk in darknesse, and set the whole world in a rore.
                     In the 5. verse of the saide Psalme. Which wordes seeme to conclude so well vpon Priestes and Bishops, as though they had bene spoken only to them.
                  Now secondly, the Priests are of much more estimation, & better, than any Kings,This is set out with plaine wordes in the cap. Duo sunt. dist. 69. and in the cap. Sacerdo

                            dist. 95. & cap. Quis dubitat. dist. 96. or Princes: yea, they do excell them as far as Leade doth Gold: and therefore must Emperours bow downe their heads vnder the knees of the Popes: as is plainely set forth by the holie father Pope Gelasius, writing vnto the Emperour Anastasius, and registred in the decrees. Yea, they are the light of the world, Fathers & Maisters to all men: so that they deserue much better to be called Gods, than either Kings or other Rulers do or can deserue.
                  
                     Thirdly, the Priestes are of more worthinesse and estimation than Angels.

                           idion Sacerdotum. Rubr. de sacramento eucha. cap. 2. For (as our deare mother the holie Churche of Rome hath verie well concluded) an Angel may not sing nor say Masse: for that hee hath not the priestly character, which is to bee vnderstoode, because hee hath not the marke and token. And it is plainelie written: That no man may buie or sell,
                     Apoc. 13.17. 
                     vnlesse hee haue the character or the marke, or else the name of the beast.
                  
                  Now, as touching the fourth cause, you must vnderstand, that all Priestes are fellow partners (in some case) with our holie Father the Pope, who is not onely a man, but a God on earth. Which considered, they must needes by kinred bee partakers of his Godhead: as it is written, That commonly a man growes like him, with whom he is conuersant. And againe, Hee that medleth with pitch, some part of it wil cleaue to him. And therefore such as bee conu
                        •
                     rsant with God on earth, must needs be godlie.
                  Fifthly, it is great reason they shoulde bee called Gods, seeing that they themselues can make God: and are (as wee

haue taught before) creatours of the Creator. And nowe there is a perpetuall and infallible rule amongest the Doctours of Louen, which can not faile, for that it is fetched out of their maister Aristotle,

                         read the 10. cap. of the 2. part. & it is this: Propter quod vnumquodque tal
                           •
                         est, illud ipsum magis est tale
                     ▪ that is to say, Whensoeuer anie thing doeth get anie vertue or estimation out of the power, or by the gift of an other: the same by whome hee doeth receiue that worthinesse or vertue, must needes haue verie much more like vertue in himselfe.
                  
                  Seeing then, that by the power and knowledge of the Priest, a piece of breade may be made God, how much rather then are the Priests themselues Gods? For it is written in the holie scripture,Iere. 16.20▪
                      
                     That no man in this world can make anie Gods: Ergo, then must the Priests of necessitie be more than men, seeing they do daily make God himselfe.
                  Now sixtly, the common Latine text, which is receiued in the holie Church of Rome, and by the Councell of Trent allowed for good & credible, doeth say thus, That God did stand in the Synagogue

of the Gods. Which may verie well bee applied to the Priestes, considering that they also haue their Synagogues, like as the Iewes haue had heretofore. And furthermore, it is most certeine, that Christ stoode in the middest of the Priestes and Prelates, at such time as Annas and Caiphas di
                        •
                      accuse him, and sought witnesses against him, to put him to death. Which manner of doing, our Priestes of the holie Church of Rome, doe verie liuely counterfeite. Whereby it is plaine to bee vnderstoode, that they are the Gods in the Synagogue, amongest whome the Lorde stoode, and doeth yet (by his elect) daily stand to bee condemned to death. So that our deare mother the holie Church of Rome, hath verie aptly applied this Text vnto them, and so concluded, That they being Gods, can in no wise bee subiect vnto the iudgement or correction of any earthly man.
                  
                  Besides this, she doth bring forth manie witnesses, euen by heapes, all which are fetched out of holy Scripture: as specially, where Saint Luke saieth, That God shall aduenge his elect.
                     Luke. 18▪
                      It is likewise

written in the Psalmes: Lorde God, to whom vengeance belongeth,
                     Psal. 194.2. 
                     God to whom vengeance belongeth, shewe thy selfe, &c. Also, the Apostle Paule saieth, What art thou that iudgest an other mannes seruant? And in the same place,Rom. 14.14. Rom. 14.13. 
                     Let vs not therefore iudge one an other anie more, but iudge this rather, that no man put a stumbling blocke or an occasion to fall in his brothers way. And the Lord saith by his Prophet Zacharie: For,
                     Zachar. 2.8. 
                     who so toucheth you, shall touche the apple of his owne eye.
                  
                  Are not these honest, goodlie, and verie strong witnesses, such as can not bee disproued? And doe they not plainlie set forth that the Priestes can not be vnder subiection to anie temporall iurisdiction? At least, so farre as men will allow and sticke vnto the exposition of the holy Church of Rome: without hauing anie respect to that which these Heretikes bring in: for they would alledge all these witnesses, directlie against the Priestes and Spiritualtie, and to their reproch and detriment. But nowe is there one speciall text to bee brought in and alledged, against the which ariseth no obiection, to wit, where Christ

saith,Math. 8.20. Luke. 9.5.8. 
                     Foxes haue their dennes, and the Foules of the aire haue their nestes, but the Sonne of man hath not whereon to laie his head. These Heretikes may well inough sloppe their eares at th
                        •
                     s: for out of this doeth our deare mother conclude verie strongly, That those which will blame or finde anie faulte with the Priestes, are they whom Christ here calleth Foxes. And to the corroboration and strengthening of the same, shee bringeth forth the text of Solomon, where he saith: Hee that hath digged the pitte, shall fall into it him selfe. Againe, The stone is heauie, and the sande is weightie, but the wrath of a foole doeth passe both. Consider, doe not these agree in one maruellous well? It seemeth they are both painted with one pencill. In summe, all her decrees and ordinances are full of such apte textes and sentences of scripture, which shee can wrest and wring maruellous finelie for her purpose: so that there is not one stitche amisse. For, when as the Scripture speaketh of Bruggesse, shee applieth that to Ghent: and if the Scripture speake of a Catte, shee will bring in a Ducke.
                  
                     For a finall end and conclusion, shee can make of a Cowe a Windmill: and of a Windmill a Cowe. And therefore she can not lacke, but doeth alway finde witnesses enow out of holie Scripture, to proue all her matters substantiall and good.
               
               
                  The xii. Chapter. VVhich proueth by Scripture, that Priestes, and all Spirituall men, ought to be rich.
                  NOwe, that the Priestes and all Spiritualtie,Spirituall persons ought to be rich. together with our holie father the Pope, ought to be rich and wealthie, that is to be found set foorth by the Scripture likewise. For the noble and excellent Cardinal Poole, of late the Popes Liefetenant in the Councell of Trent,
                     In the booke that he made of the councel of Trent. did cause the text of Luke (before alleadged) to serue for that purpose, where Christ saith: You doe nowe catche fishe, but you shall from hence foorth catch men.
                     Luke. 15.10. For that (said hee) was a prophesie which was not yet accomplished in the time of the Apostles, when as Paule said: That there were but a fewe rich men in the Congregation of Christ: but the same (said he) was first fulfilled & accomplished

about three hundred yeeres after, to wit, at such time (men say) as the Emperour Constantine did courteouslie giue vnto Pope Syluester,
                     
                        Ca. Constantin.
                      a great portion of the Empire of Rome, or rather (as hee tearmeth it) did giue againe and restore: as is apparant by the copie of the writing, which standeth entred in the booke of Decrees verbatim.
                  
                  True it is, that Laurentius Valla, and manie other learned men, did mocke and ieast at this writing, & likewise do plainlie proue, as well by diuerse histories, as by the same writing it selfe, that it is but a counterfeited writing, and that so grosselie done, that a Calfe with one eye may perceiue it. But I will leaue that to the Doctours of Louen, to dispute vpon, when they are set vnder the roofe, with a Gallon of good Rennish wine, for they can not away with Pittaw: as for vs, whether it be a lie or a true tale, it is all one: but thus much there is of the matter, that our holie father the Pope is in possession, and doth enioy the landes which S. Peter left vnto him by testament: by the same token it is called, Patrimonium S. Petri, that is, Saint Peters patrimonie

Paule him selfe saith, That Bishops must keepe hospitalitie, and bee harborous. And then is it great reason▪ that their purses should bee well filled, for to enterteine Kings and Princes, and to make them great cheere.This is the argument of Eckius in his Enchei

I assure you, if they had not that preeminence and aduantage, they would not buy Bishoprikes so deare, neither would they pay thirtie thousand Ducates for a Pallium, if they must afterwardes say with Peter, Aurum & argentum non est mihi: I haue neither siluer nor golde. But that is nowe all cleane turned, and the chaunce is chaunged: therefore must the Priestes and Prelates nowe a dayes bee riche, and possesse the goods of the worlde, considering that their father and master the Pope, is Lord of the whole worlde: as we haue sufficientlie

proued in the 11. and 12. Chapters before.
               
               
                  The xiii. Chapter. VVherein is set forth by the Scripture, the praying to images.
                  NOwe will wee treate a while of the praying to images,To pray to images. and see with what Scriptures it is defended. For that second holie Councell of Nice,
                     Reade the first chap. of the 4. parte. fol. 4. is (without doubt) maruellous well furnished of excellent scriptures, which serue as fitte for that purpose, as Roses for a swine stie. But we will onlie choose out and set forth the principall and most meete to serue our turne, to the intent that euerie man may iudge by those, what all the rest are. Among other they haue fetched out of the olde testament, That GOD did shape man to his owne likenesse:
                     In the Epistle of Pope Adrian, read and accepted in the coūcell of Nice, act 2. reade the 2. booke of the coūcell. fol. 482. a. b. act. 2. pag. 486. and therevpon concluded, That men may verie well haue images. Item, that God hath diuided the light from the darkenesse, and therefore (saith Agapius, that most holie Bishop of Caesarea) I accept images gladlie, and cursed bee all they, which are of other opinion. Aha, my friendes! Howe like you this geare? And after that is the writing of Adrian, the Pope of Rome read: wherin hee saith,

That Iames did pray to Iosephs staffe, or else to Ioseph him selfe.
                        Act. 2. Synod Nicaenae pag. 480. Then (I pray you) wherefore should not wee pray to images? For although that Heretikes do herein so crie out with the Hebrewe texte, which saith, That he prayed to God, leaning vpon his bedde, or vppon a staffe, (for it may be taken both wayes) yet notwithstanding it is sufficient for vs, that our deare mother the holy Church hath vnderstood it otherwise:
                        Concil. Nicen. of Irene.
                      and that all the forked Bishops which were assembled at Nice, haue otherwise interpreted it.
                  For they (you must vnderstande) could not misse, nor erre, seeing they were assembled, inspired, and gouerned by the holie ghost of the Empresse Irene: whose spirit was so zealouslie addicted vnto the worshipping of images, that shee did put out her sonnes eyes, who was the right and naturall Emperour, and so kept him shut vp in prison, to the ende that she might haue the rule and gouernement, reigne as Queene all alone, and set vp and extoll images, according to her owne minde.
                  Wherfore should not we then beleue this holy Ghost? Whereas he hath declared by

the mouthes of the Bishops, that there was a litle proper fellowe carued out vpon the end of Iosephs staffe, as you see vpon the staues that children and fooles doe ride vpon: yea, and that the same pretie fellowe was by Iacob worshipped?

For it is plainlie written, that a candle is not to bee set vnder a bushell, but in a candlesticke, that euerie man may bee lighted thereby:In the epistle of Adrian to the synod. act. 2. fol. 481. which the holie fathers doe likewise vnderstande by the images, to witte, that they must stande on high pranking vppon the altars, and so be deuoutlie prayed vnto by the common sort.
                  Besides all this, they bring forth, that Moses did set vppe a brasen Serpent in the wildernesse,The brasen serpent. by Gods commaundement,

to the intent that all such as should looke therevpon, might bee healed of the biting of the venomous serpentes. For vppon that text of scripture they say thus: What follie and madnesse should it then bee of vs, that wee should yet doubte, whether all such as looke vpon the image of Christ, the image of our Ladie, and of all other holie Saintes, shall become holie, and shall likewise bee healed of all diseases?
                  
                  Which thing is likewise by the holie father Pope Adrian, most faithfully assured with Bull and Seale:In the foresaid epis
                           •
                        le sent to the fathers of the Councell. so as there is no further doubte to bee made in that matter: the rather, for that this is to bee seene euidentlie at Halle, a towne in Brabant, where so manie 
                        •
                     rutches of lame men, and so manie painted tables are hanging, of such as haue bene so well and perfectlie healed of their diseases, that the most part of those which hang there, neuer feele anie paine or griefe, neither in the head, nor in the bladder. I speake not of so manie wiues, as haue bene conceiued with childe, after that they had once had our holie and blessed Ladies girdle tied about their middles.
                  
                     And nowe of late it chaunced in Holland, That a poore woman with a verie great bellie came verie deuoutlie, to seeke our blessed Ladie of Heukelem, and when shee had giuen her offering, shee returned home againe,A miracle. and left her great bellie behinde her. Yea, there was a blinde Gentleman came out of Fraunce, to Saint Iob of Wesemale in pilgrimage, to recouer his sight againe, which he had lost by Saint Iobs disease: and after hee had well ended his businesse, hee cried to his seruaunt in French, Ie voy, which the Doctours of Louen did vnderstande, not to bee, that hee would be gone, but that hee did see. In so much that the same is written,In the table of S. Georges miracles. and hanged vp vppon a table in the Church for a great miracle. And it is to bee crediblie beleeued, that hee did see as well without spectacles, as with a candle.
                  I forbeare to speake of the great miracles which the holie and mightie blessed Ladies at Laureto in Italie, and Montferrato in Spaine doe: and of Saint Iames of Compostella, and Saint Catharina of Scena, and such other like holie hee Saintes, and shee Saintes: for that

is not meate for euerie mans mouth: wee must content our selues with courser meates, and keepe our mouthes close from such daintie dishes. Yet notwithstanding, if there were a plompe Hollander, or a Malle Brabander, or a Botte Flemming that had a stomache or appetite to such lordlie fare, and would goe take vpon him a pilgrimage for a wager, to come againe within a certeine time, hee may doe so well inough, and so goe and strawe his lust abroad amongest the holie and blessed Ladies of Spaine and Italie, and see what great miracles they can doe more, than our Ladies can doe here.
                  
                     Hee might perhappes speede as well as a good honest man of Paris, who could haue no children by his wife, and in hope of helpe, did vowe diuerse pilgrimages: And first hee went to seeke Saint Iames at Compostella, and from thence hee went to Rome to visite the holie Apostles, Peter and Paul: and then on forwarde to our holie and blessed Ladie of Laureto, and from thence to Hierusalem: and last of all, to Saint Catharine of Scena: in fine

so as hee was about a three yeeres from home: And then when hee came home againe, hee found his wife merrie, and had in the meane space gotten three prettie children, with helpe of the good Saintes, which hee so deuoutlie had sought.
                  
                  Was not this nowe a great miracle? Therefore, who soeuer hath a desire to goe from home, and seeke Saintes, hee may set forwarde, when soeuex hee will, the wagon standeth readie.
                  And nowe will wee proceede to our matter againe, and campe with these Heretikes, who mocke and iest with these our holie fathers of the foresaid Councell, because they bring in and alledge an example of the brasen serpent, to establishe their images, by saying, That the same was a figure in the olde Testament, pointing to Christ, and was set vppe by GOD his speciall commaundement: but vnto this wee will answere them, That they haue eaten stockfish, and knowe not what doeth belong to a pregnant and ripe wit: for otherwise, can they not perceiue, that our images are figures likewise, as wel of Christ, as of his deare mother, grandmother,

and other holie hee Saintes and she Saintes: yea, and that are by speciall commaundement of our holie father the Pope, and the holie Church set foorth. But yet for all this, these dull Heretikes goe on forward with their follie, saying, That the good King Ezechias did breake downe and burne to powder,Brasen serpent burnt. 2. Reg. 18.4. the same brasen serpent, as soone as euer hee sawe and did perceiue, that the people beganne to cense and honour it, in like manner as the holie Church of Rome doeth nowe honour and worship her Saintes. And those mad brained fellowes doe therevpon conclude, that wee ought likewise euen so to burne our images. But wee denie that flatlie: for that was an other matter, considering that our images are no serpentes, as that was.
                  It is verie true, that wee doe as well cense to Saint Margaret, Saint Georges dragon, and Saint Anthonies hogs, as to the Saints themselues, & pray to the one as well as to the other, although those are not much better than serpents: but that now is otherwise to be cōsidered, for it is not done in honor of the dragons, but of the Sainte which they stand by: as is well proued by a

certeine Doctour of Louen, who going out of the porche of the graie Friers, at Louen did put off his bonnet before the image of Pilate, which standeth there, & sodenly turning back again, cried wt a lowd voice: Non tibi Pilate, sed Christo, as though hee would haue said: As for thee Pilate, thou art but a varlot: what dost thou thinke? I did not put off my bonnet to thee, but to that Christ, with whom thou art dealing.
                  
                  Nowe consider, euen so standeth the matter with our Dragons, and with S. Anthonies hogs. They gette many times offrings and waxe candles, and are often times kissed for neighbourhood, for the good Saint sake by whom they stand: but they doe not take it vppon them selues, no more then a dumbe stocke or blocke. Therfore remaineth this determination of the holy fathers of the said Councell, alwayes fast and ratified, to witte, That the holie Church must haue images: seeing that the Iewes had a brasen serpent. This is likewise mainteined with manie other goodlie testimonies, as specially with that which the prophet Dauid saith in the 96. psalme, There is praise & honor before his face.
                     Psal. 96.
                     
Item, I loue the cituatiō of thine house.
                     Psal. 28.8. For by these followeth, that the Churches must be trimmed vp with goodly images. Item, O Lord, I seeke thy countenance,
                     Psal. 27.8. Item, O Lord, the rich shall pray before thy face. Item,Psal. 4.7. 
                     Let the light of thy countenance shine vpon vs. For out of these textes do they conclude, that men ought to haue our Lords visage goodly painted, and to pray to it. And for that cause it is, that euerie yeare at Rome vpon good Friday, the holie Veronica, which is an old ouer worne cloute, whereon they say our Lords face is painted, which they pray vnto with great deuotion. And the common people crie alowde, Misericordia, misericordia, that is, Mercie, mercie. The like is done also at Besanson in Burgonia, and in manie other places. For this same holie fisnomie of the Veronica, was sette vpon good grounde, and is therefore so well sp
                        ••
                     ung vp, and in such plentie, that there are to bee found a number of them, all which do worke great miracles.
                  And besides this, they bring forth these testimonies, to witte, that the beliefe commeth not onely by hearing, but likewise by sight: for that Iohn saith, Like as

we haue heard,
                     2. Iohn. 1.1. Num. 15.38. Deut. 6.8. Matth. 23.4. 
                     so haue we likewise sene. Item, That the Iewes did weare broade borders vpon their clothes: Ergo, so must wee likewise haue images in the church: with many such other like proofes, which close vp together as fitte as a spindle vpon a flesh pot. So now, when anie man hath a desire to see these goodly testimonies, let him read ouer the whole proceeding of the saide Councell of Nice, as it is sette foorth in the seconde booke of Councels, or else he may reade another little booke, which was set foorth about the same time, in the name of the Emperour Carolus magnus, touching the same Councell: hee shall therein reioyce his spirites, with reading of all those goodly, copious, and fine allegations, brought out and alledged by those holie fathers, to that end and purpose:Read the councel of Nice. act. 4. fol. 521. There doth the Monke Theodosius declare these pleasant histories of the dreame of Constantine, and of the waren image of Cosmus and Damianus.
                      and with the dreames of Constantine, who (to heale his leprosie) had shedde the bloud of young innocent children, and was for the same comforted by Peter and Paule, in his dreames. And there you shall finde also, a great manie of goodlie and notable miracles done by images, taken out of the booke of Cosmus, and Damianus, and out of the booke

of Sophronius, of the miracles of Saints, and other such like bookes, which those holie fathers caused there to bee read and heard, and by their iudgementes established them, and allowed them for good. So as there is no more doubtes to be put in them, than vpon the golden Legende, which standes authentike in the Masse booke. And to the end that men shall haue the more desire to read them, I will bring forth here one example out of them, seruing greatly for our purpose: to the ende you may perceiue by the nest, what birdes are within it.
                  
                     There was a liuely holie Monke,
                     This prettie ieast was read in the councell of Nicaen by the Monke Stephanus, out of the booke of Sophronius: reade of the 2. booke of the councels in the 2. councell of Nicaen. act. 4. fo. 520. ad 
                     whiche was continually tempted and troubled with a diuell, euen till his olde dayes: and when in the end he beganne to waxe wearie of it, hee then did pray the diuell verie friendly, that hee woulde let him alone in quiet: wherevpon the diuell did answere him, that so farre as he would promise to do, and sweare to keepe secrete, a thing that hee woulde commaunde him, then hee woulde leaue off to trouble him anie more. The Monke did promise him, and tooke therevpon a deepe othe.

Then said the diuell: If thou wilt that I shall trouble thee no more, then thou must not pray anie more to that image: and it was an image of our Ladie, holding her childe in her armes. But the Monke was more craftie than the diuel: for he went and confessed him of it the next day to the Abbot, and the Abbot did dispense with him for his othe, vpon condition, that hee should continue his praying to the image.
                  
                  Is not that a fine and worthie testimonie, borowed of the diuell, whereby the holie Fathers in the foresaide Councell, haue wonderfull strongly established the praying vnto images? Truely it is worthie to be written vpon balkes and beames, because calues shall not licke it off. And our Champion, maister Gentianus, is worthie to carie the standard, & to be crowned with a three footed stoole, seeing hee dare so boldly aduenture, to lay the worthinesse of that Councell in the ballance, against the second commaundement of God, which doth sharpely forbid all worshipping and praying to images: and likewise bringeth in the said Councell, against the Councell of Eliberum, which was kept in Spaine,
                     
in the yeare of our Lorde 1200, and was consonant and agreeable vnto the worde of God.
               
               
                  The xiiii. Chapter. VVhich treateth of some particular images, and painted tables, which the Church of Rome doth vse, and for the establishing of the same by the Scripture.
                  NOwe, because these Heretikes are most busie with some speciall images,Diuerse particular images & painted tables of the holie Church. which the holie Church of Rome doe vse with great deuotion, and with them doe these Heretikes mocke and ieast most of all: it is verie necessarie that wee proue and establish the same out of the holy scripture. Then, to begin withall, it is not to be mocked, nor wondered at, that they in their Churches, and Masse bookes, doe paint the Trinitie with three faces: for our mother the holie Church, did learne that at Rome, where they were wont to paint or carue Ianus with two faces. And then further, there is written in Iohn,The trinitie with three faces. 
                     That there are three in heauen which beare witnesse, the Father, the Worde, and the Holie ghost: and these three are one, &c. Then of necessitie they must

be painted or made with three heades, or three faces, vpon one necke. For whereas these heretikes say, that it is plaine forbidden, to make the likenesse of God any maner of way, seeing God himselfe saith: Thou didst heare a voyce out of the bush,
                     Deut. 4.12. 
                     but thou sawest no likenesse: Therfore be well warie,This did the fathers of the Councell off Nice cut of thus: the like 
                           
                              •
                           ckius, saying, that the Iewes were addicted to idolatrie. that thou make not anie image after my likenesse: That was spoken to the Iewes onelie, and is now altered through the worthie custome and vsage of our deare mother the holie Church of Rome.
                  And whereas the holy Church hath also chosen to make the similitude of the father, an olde man, with a long gray beard: and for the sonne, a man hanging on the crosse: and for knowledge of the holie Ghost, a doue: that is done of her owne inuention and free will. For she might as well haue made a bushe, or a flame of fire, or a cloude, to counterfeite the father: for that he did shewe himselfe in all these likenesses, as well as in the likenesse of a man, or they might as well haue made for Christ, a childe in a cradle, or a man teaching and instructing the people. And likewise for the holie Ghost, a tongue, or

a flame of fire, as well as they doe a man crucified, or a doue. But therein shee doeth vse her libertie: for that hath alwayes his course by the common rule, which is:

                        Sic volo, sic iubeo, stet pro ratione voluntas:
                        Our pleasure is as we command,
                     
                  
                  
                     Our lust for lawe perforce shall stand. Or according to that which the Poet Horace saith in a verse:

                        Pictoribus atqué Poetis,
                        Quidlibet audendi semper fuit aequa potestas:

                        euen at ther owne pleasure.

Michael is made with a paire of balance in his hand, that is, because hee must wey the soules, to see whether their good workes & deserts be not heuier in weight,Rom. 3.4. Galat. 4. Ephe. 2. than their sinnes & of fences. For (as before we haue written) the holy church hath appointed him that office, because she esteemeth it a sure article, that none can be saued by the merits, bloud and

passion of our Lorde Iesus Christ onelie,

                      yet Paule doeth so teach: but euerie man must (by his owne good works & deserts) bee weyed out and saued, making full satisfaction thereby, of his sinnes and offences.
                  After this now, where Moses is painted with hornes, is vpon this occasion. For that it is written, to witte, that the face of Moses did shine (as Paule himselfe doeth set it forth) that hath the common translation of the holie Church expounded thus, That Moses had hornes, for that he should be as it were a figure of our Bishoppes, which now likewise we are two hornes.
                  And whereas they make of the three wise men,The three Kings. that came out of the East, three Kings, and one of those as blacke as pitch, like a Morian, that is fetched out of the wordes of Dauid,Psal. 72.10. or Solomon, saying: Kings shall come out of the Moores lande, to worship Christ. For this hath the holy Church interpreted, to be spoken by the three wise men. And although the Morians land, lay much more to the West of Iurie, than to the East, from whence the wise men came, that is of no importance: for the holie Church can alter the

lying and situation of the landes, and make of the West the East.
                  Againe,The Oxe and the Asse by the cribbe. whereas they haue likewise set an Oxe and an Asse by the cribbe of their litle Iesus, whiche doe warme him with their breath: that is grounded vpon the plaine Text of Esaie, who saith, The Oxe doth know his maisters will,
                     Esaie 1.3. 
                     and an Asse the cribbe of his maister: but the people of Israel will vnderstande nothing at all, &c. Yea, and it may be a verie good allusion, that by the Oxe, the Bishoppes, Abbattes, and Prelates, are vnderstood, because they weare hornes also, like an Oxe, and can roare out excellentlie well against these heretikes, better than they can preache the worde of God. And by the Asse may verie well be vnderstoode the graie Friers, which are likewise as graie as asses, and therewithall, all the residue of Monkes, Friers, and poore Priestes, who are not much better learned than Asses, and doe esteeme Christ still as a young childe that lies yet in the cribbe, and therefore go about to please him & make him contented with goodlie images, and puppets, with belles & rattelles, with piping, and daunsing, and

with such other like fonde toyes and ceremonies.
                  
                     Saint Lungies with a Lance.Againe, where they paint S. Lungies, who pricking Christ in the side with a speare, receiued his sight, by vertue of the bloud which sprinckled in his eyes, that is likewise proued by good scriptures. For Saint Iohn saith,Iohn. 19.34. 
                     That a souldier with a speare did pearce Christes side. And this speare in the Greeke was called Longi, whereof the holy Church hath made a Saint, and named the same S. Longinus. And because the saide Iohn said: That it came so to passe,
                     Iohn. 19.37. 
                     because the Scripture should bee fulfilled, saying: They shall looke vpon him whom they haue pearced:
                     Zach. 12.18. Out of that haue they fetched the lies or Legend of S. Lungies, as to say that he was blind, and thinking to haue thrust his speare into a Crowe, did thrust it into the side of Iesus Christ, and so the bloud did spring out into his eyes, wherby he receiued his sight: and was long afterwards canonized by the Pope, and put into the Kalendar for a Saint.
                  In summe, all their paintings, and all those dumbe images, which are set vp in Churches: as the Apostles with rounde

trenchers behinde their heades, and euerie one of them with his weapon in his hande, our Ladie with her fris

                     ed haire, and goodlie golden garmentes, with her perukes, fine kerchiefs, and goodly set forth with all her conceites like a Princesse of this world, and Saint Katharine, and S. Barbara, bare breasted, with their embrodered and stitched workes, as trimly deck
                        •
                      and painted, as the Courtesans of Rome, and Venice. And all this can our deare mother fetch finely out of the scriptures: yea, and shee can finde you a threede for euerie needle. So that these Heretikes haue nothing to say to this: for whatsoeuer is done of a good intent and purpose, and to the profite of our deare mother the holie Church of Rome, that must bee by God accepted without anie doubt, and hee must of necessitie passe it in his reckoning booke, or else muscels were no fishe, neither should you haue anie oysters at Billingsgate.

                        •

Out of that hath holie Church concluded, That men may eate no fleshe vpon the fasting dayes. Item, after that Adam had sinned, then did God curse the earth. And now we doe knowe verie well,

that all fleshe which is to be eaten, commeth of the earth. Therefore hath our deare mother the holie Church streightlie defended and forbidden all men, which on the moste principall and holie-fasting dayes, must doe penance for their sinnes, that in no wise, they doe eate anie flesh, on those dayes,Fleshe forbiddē to be eaten, and wherefore. least they shoulde be partakers of the cursing of the earth, like as the holie Bishop Durandus hath verie well set it forth.

                  But what needes all this? And though the flesh were not cursed, nor vncleane: yet notwithstanding our deere mother the holy Church hath great reason to forbid the eating of it: for that shee (at the least) may haue a difference in the eating of meates, and in that point shewe her selfe something like vnto the figures and shadowes of the olde Testament, wherein the children of Israel▪ were forbidden certaine kindes of flesh, as a thing vncleane. Although that our deare mother is of such discretion and vnderstanding, that she doth not esteeme flesh to be altogether vncleane in it selfe. For otherwise our holie Father

the Pope, with his Bishops, and Cardinals, woulde not so well digest it, that they woulde as well in the Lent, as on good Friday it selfe, licke their fingers after it. But shee doth not meane to vse her Prelates straitely in that matter:

Tim. 4.4. hath had another respect in this matter: as that shee did esteeme the fleshe for vncleane, but not in it selfe, but vnto suche as haue not bought Bulles of licence of the Pope, to the ende they might digest the same with a cleare conscience. For like as in the time of Paule,1. Tim.

                        . all meates were made holie by prayer and by thankesgiuing: so is the meate nowe made holie with the Popes Bulles: for whosoeuer hath those, may boldely eate of all meates without anie scruple, and say with a good conscience,

                     Omnia munda mundis: that is to say, To a man that is cleane, all things are cleane. But he that hath no Bull, although he had ten times prayed, and giuen God thankes for his good giftes, yet that can not helpe him at all: hee must bee cursed, excommunicated, and cleane rooted out of the number of the good Catholikes and faithfull subiectes of our deare mother the holie Church of Rome: yea, and bee burnt at a stake, like an arrant and gracelesse Heretike.
                  And therefore it is that the holie Prelates, Cardinals, Bishops, and all other loyall subiects of the sea of Rome, doe so often forget to say grace and prayers at their meate: and when as sometime (by ill hap) they do say grace (which happens verie seldome) they say it commonly in a tongue or language, which neither they themselues, nor but a verie fewe of those which sit at the table with them, do vnderstand: not es

their Bulles well sealed, & hanging downe with silken tassels: yea, and such as they themselues can well both read and vnderstand, otherwise it were all not worth a strawe.
                  So now then, flesh (on fish dayes) is vncleane, to them that haue no Bulles: which you may conceiue by this, That in Spaine, where the holie inquisition doeth beare the swinge: yet he, whosoeuer that can get a Bull for a royall of plate, may eate (all the Lent through) puddings, tripes, and all the entrails, with head, neck, and purtenaunce, without anie daunger or scruple of conscience.

the Popes Buls: but otherwise, it is all well inough, as here before is sufficientlie proued.

                        Touching Lent seeke the decres Statuimus with the .2. folowing dist. 76. and cap. Solen. de consecra. dist. 1. and chefely cap. Quadra. de consecra. dist 5. where this argument is rehearsed.
                        In the foresaid chap. here followeth the verie woordes of the Glosse vpon the decrees, Can. Quadra. de consecra. dist. 5.
                     ANd nowe, as touching the time of Lent, that is verie stronglie proued by our deare mother the holie Church out of the scripture. For it is written, That we are bound to offer vp vnto GOD the tenth part of our goods. And now (saith the holie Church) Lent is the tenth part of the yeere: and therefore must wee necessarilie obserue the whole Lent, not presuming to eate anie fleshe at all: Considering that (as is before said) flesh proceedeth of the earth which is accursed: for nowe for the tenthes of three hundreth three score and fiue dayes wee must fast sixe and thirtie dayes: and yet there remaines fiue dayes & sixe houres: and of these fiue dayes we do fast foure, not for payment of tenthes, but for an other occasion, to wit, That the talies of good workes and merites might be full.

So there remaineth yet one day and sixe houres,
                     Occasion of the fasting daies. 
                     which maketh iust thirtie houres, whereof the tenth is not paid: but for recompense of that, we must go late to supper.
                  
                  So nowe, is not this past verie iust? Now let God come and take a reckoning when soeuer hee will, and hee shall finde, that the holie Church of Rome is not one pennie in his debt: nay, shee hath rather paide him more than his duetie. For this reckoning you shall finde passed and set downe in the reckoning booke of the Decrees, if God will accept & allowe of that booke (as no doubt hee must) considering that his liefetenants the holie Popes are the makers of it, & then all is cocke sure on our side: & the Catholiks must into heauen, though they shuld go barefoote & bare leg. It helpeth to prate & pratle, the heauen is theirs, if they can gette into it, by meanes of obseruing their Lent well.
                  Nowe further, for fasting,In the booke of decrees. cap significa. de electione. ca. Deus omni. 2. q. 1. and the Glosse vpon the argument of the .6. booke of decrees. wee find written also: That Christ did fast fourtie dayes in the wildernesse, Ergo, then wee must do the like, following the common rule: Omnis Christi actio, nostra est instructio, that is, after the meaning of our

mother the holie Church,) all, whatsoeuer Christ hath done, we must counterfeite and do the like after him. For, notwithstanding that this was a miracle done for the establishing of his doctrine, as Moses and Elias had done before, which in deede we can not do after him: yet we must doe what we can, and so resemble Apes & Munkies, which, though they can not doe as men do, in speaking, and vnderstanding with reason: yet they will counterfeite men in anie thing that possiblie they can compasse. For so hath our deare mother the holie Church concluded, not onelie in this matter, but in all whatsoeuer Christ hath done.

                  And as Christ did shedde his bloud, so nowe in figure thereof,Bloudie mantles and hattes of the Cardinals. must the Cardinals weare bloud redde scarlet mantles, or cloakes and hattes. For, whereas these

Heretikes will say, that their garmentes looke so bloude red, by reason of the bloud of the Martyrs, which they haue shed: or else, that their clothes are red, for shame of the shamefull deedes which their maisters doe: all this can not bee true, seeing that Durandus, Innocentius, and all other Catholike men doe otherwise interprete it.

                  Item, because that Herod did clothe Christ in a white garment, therefore must the Priests weare a long white garment like a shirt vpon their coates or gownes at such time as they must play their partes in the Masse.A white garment. And then, because the Iewes did afterwardes cloth him with purple,

therefore they put on the cope aloft vppon that white cloth.Cope and stole in the Masse.

                  And further, because he was nailed vpon the crosse, with his armes stretcht abroad: therefore do they likewise stretch out their armes abroade in the Masse, as though they would be crucified.
                  And because hee was wounde in a fine white cloth, when he was buried, therefore doe they lay their litle god vppon a white cloth, fast by the chalice.
                  And because the souldiers did cut Christ his garments in pieces, and so dealt them amongst them for a prey, therfore it is that the Priestes do (vpon good Friday) couer their altar with one single cloth, & then laie two other small clothes or napkins, at the endes of the altar: and as soone as they begin to sing these wordes: Partiti sunt vestimenta mea, They diuided my garments amongst them: so must likewise those two clothes or napkins by and by be stollen & pluckt away from the altar.
                  And because Christ after his resurrection

did breath vpon his Disciples, and gaue vnto them the holie Ghost. Therefore it is that the Bishops and Suffraganes, at such time as they doe create anie Priest, doe blowe vpon them: for with that same winde are the Priestes filled as full of the holie Ghost, as a Cowe turde is stuffed full of muske and ambers grease.
                  In summe, Christ hath not done anie thing in his death and passion, but they do plaie and counterfeite the same after him, so trimlie and liuelie, that no plaier nor iuggler is able to do it better.
                  Yea, do we not see likewise, that vppon good Friday they haue a Crucifixe, either of wood, or of stone, which they laie downe softlie vpon the ground, that euerie bodie may cōme creeping to it, vpon handes and knees, & so kisse the feete of it, as men are accustomed to doe to the Pope of Rome? And then they put him in a graue,Creeping to the Crucifixe and burying it. t

                     ll Easter: at which time they take him vppe againe, and sing, Resurrexit, non est hic, Alleluia: He is risen, he is not here: God be thanked. Yea and in some places, they make the graue in a hie place in the church where men must goe vp manie steppes, which are decked with blacke cloth from

aboue to beneath, and vpon euerie steppe standeth a siluer candlesticke with a waxe candle burning in it, and there doe walke souldiours in harnesse, as bright as Saint George, which keepe the graue, till the Priests come & take him vp: and then commeth sodenlie a flash of fire, wherwith they are all afraid and fall downe: and then vpstartes the man, and they begin to sing Alleluia, on all handes, and then the clocke striketh eleuen.
                  Then againe vpon Whitsunday they begin to play a new Enterlude,The holy ghost on Whitsunday. for then they send downe a Doue out of an Owles nest, deuised in the roofe of the church: but first they cast out rosin and gunpouder, wt wilde fire, to make the children afraide, and that must needes be the holie ghost, which commeth with thunder and lightening.
                  Likewise, vpon Ascension day, they pull Christ vp on hie wt ropes aboue the clouds,The Crucifix ascendeth to heauen. by a vice deuised in the roofe of the church, & they hale him vp, as if they would pull him vp to the gallowes: and there stande the poore Priests, and looke so pitifully after their God, as a dogge for his dinner.
                  In summe, a man doeth often spende a pennie or two, to see a play of Robin hood,

or a Morisse daunse, which were a great deale better bestowed vppon these apishe toies of these good Priests, which counterfeite all these matters so handsomlie, that it will do a man asmuch good to see them, as in frostie weather to goe naked.
                  I speake not of their perambulations, processions, & going about the towne, cariing their crucifixes alongst the streetes, & there play and counterfeite the whole passion, so trimlie with all the seuen sorrowes of our Lady, as though it had ben nothing else, but a simple and plaine Enterlude, to make boyes laugh at, and a litle to recreat heauie or sorrowfull hearts: for these matters fal out onlie vpon church holy dayes or solemnities, when the Catholikes are determined to be merrie, & drink thēselues so droncke, that they tumble frō their seat: as you shal see our Maisters of Louen doo euery yere in their solemnitie, & especially at the seuenth yeres procession, which is, of the seuen sorrowes of our Ladie. All what soeuer Christ hath done, must bee set abroch to be counterfeite.
                  And after the same manner, wee play by the Lent. For, because Christ did fast fourtie daies lōg, therfore shal our dere mother

the holie church bee content to fill her belly all sortes of fish onlie, not once touching one morsell of flesh, according to the special wordes of Paule, who saith, Eate it not: Taste it not: Handle it not.
                     Col. 2.21. And so likewise Moses did fast fourtie dayes, for the establishing of the lawes of God, which he presented vnto the people. And now, seeing the Bishops & Prelates do weare hornes, as Moses did, wherefore should they not as well faste fourtie dayes as he did? And if the Bishops doo faste, then are the Leye people much more bounde to faste, which haue no such power nor meane to obteine dispensations, bulles, or tollerations of our holie father the Pope, as these holie Prelates haue.
                  Therefore we do now conclude, without exception or contradiction, That the holie time of Lent is as firmelie founded vpon the scripture, as all the rest of the articles of the faith inuented and founded by our deare mother the holie church of Rome: and therfore it is good reason, that our mother the holie church of Rome do maintein her Lent & fish dayes in great reputation, & not onelie to hold it for a good and holie work in it self, but for a meritorious work,

whereby we may merit & deserue heauen, & the mercie of God, appease his wrath, and do & make sufficient satisfaction & recompense for all our sins. In so much that our deare mother doth esteeme her fasting: yea in a manner better, than the merites of the blessed bloud & passion of Iesus Christ, whervpon these Heretikes doe altogether boast themselues.In the Masse booke. For consider, this the holie church saith in one of her secretes, vpon the Wednesday in the Ember weeke in the Aduent, and on Friday in the Ember dayes after Whitsunday, and vppon the Tuesday in Easter weeke:
                  
                     O Lord, we beseech thee, that thou wilt accept this our fasting, and that by it we may be made cleane & purified, & worthie of thy mercie, & that it may bring vs vnto euerlasting saluation, &c.
                  
                  What can a man wish or desire more? S. Iohn the Apostle will seeme to set foorth a speciall matter, when hee saith: That the bloud of Christ Iesus doth cleanse vs of our sinnes, & maketh vs acceptable before God the father: but this other nowe doth growe all vpon our owne ground: for with our fasting we can obteine that well inough, which he doth attribute onelie to the bloud of Iesus Christ.

And of the hallowing of Easter eeuen, shee doeth say plainlie as followeth:
                  
                     Huius igitur sanctificatio noctis,
                     This is sung the Saturday following nexte after. 
                     fugat scelera, culpas lauat, & reddit innocentiam lapsis, moestis laetitiam, fugat odia, concordiam parit, & curuat imperia:
                  
                  That is to say:
                  
                     The halowing of this night, doth driue away sinnes, doth purge faults, doth restore such as are fallen to their innocencie againe, and to the sorowfull giueth gladnesse, and expelleth all hatred, procureth concord, and doth bow Empires or Kingdomes, &c.
                  
                  Consider nowe, what a power the obseruing of these festiual dayes hath. What a mischiefe ayles these Heretikes, that they so raile vpon vs, because wee make

a difference and diuersitie of dayes? They make a doe with vs, saying, That Iesus Christ with his precious bloud,Col. 2.14.16. hath clearlie adnichilated and taken away the instrument which was against vs, which consisted wholie in such ceremonies and commaundements of the lawe, and hath made fast the same vnto his crosse: so that no man else can hereafter iudge vs, for our meates or drinkes, nor for the obseruing of anie holie dayes, of new Moones, or Sabbaoths: and still they are troubling of vs with that, which Paule writeth to the Galathians, saying:
                  
                     Gal. 4.9.10.
                     Seeing that you haue nowe knowen God, or rather that you are knowen of GOD, howe doeth it happen, that you returne your selues againe to obseruing and worshipping of weake elementes, which you beginne and goe about to serue againe? You obserue dayes, monthes, times, and yeeres, I am afraied on your behalfes, that all my trauell amongst you, will be spent in vaine▪ &c.
                  
                  But what haue we to do with this▪ seeing our mother the holie Church doeth attribute as much power to the obseruing of

our festiuall dayes, as to the bloud of Christ it selfe: and therefore haue our Catholike Doctours reason, in teaching, That the obseruation of certeine dayes & feastes, heretofore vsed by the Iewes, are not in anie point taken away, by the death and bloud of Iesus Christ, as Paule goeth about to perswade, so alway as the dayes bee something altered:In his Enchiridion. as Eckius hath verie finelie set foorth. For in place of their Passeouer of the lawe, wee haue our Easter: and in place of their Pentecost, we haue a Whitsuntide of our owne deuising: and in steade of the feast of the newe Moone, wee haue our Ladies dayes: and in place of their Trumpet feasts, we haue the Apostles dayes: and in place of their feast of Tabernacles, wee haue our Church holydayes or solemnities: and so forth, as is plainlie to be seene in the booke of the said Eckius
                     ▪ So that there is no other difference, but as though the diuell (to disguise him selfe) should put on a Friers cowle. And wheresoeuer in the olde Testament anie mention is made of feast dayes, our deare mother the holie Church of Rome, applieth it to the establishing of her festiuall, or holie

daies and solemnities: so that the Heretikes can not iustly complaine of vs in this case, & say, that we can not bring in any Scriptures for proofe of the matter: seeing that the olde Testament is full of such Scripture, as they them selues knowe well inough.

                     A forbidding of matrimonie for Priestes.NOwe as touching the forbidding of Priestes, Monkes, Friers, and all other Spirituall persons, to marrie, that matter we can not defende by the olde Testament, seeing that in the old Testament all Priestes were married. Therefore, in this matter we will haue nothing to doe with the olde Testament, because it doeth make against vs: but wee say, that it is chaunged by the newe, as heretofore wee haue proued by speciall textes, as to write, where it is written: None of those that liue after the fleshe,
                     Rom. 8.8. 
                     can please God. Againe:Leuit. 10.18.11.25. 
                     Be you holie, like as I am holie, & more such like, which hertofore we haue alledged, and by the booke of decrees

established for euer. Yea, and it was specially prophesied by Paule,1. Tim. 4.3. 
                     That in the latter dayes there shoulde come such as should forbid marriage, and the eating of meates, which God hath created and ordeined to bee eaten with thankesgiuing. So that it is no maruell, that it was not forbidden in the olde Testament, nor yet in the beginning of the new testament: for these last dayes, whereof Paule speaketh, were not yet come: and as a good wise Doctour, & holie Priest of Groining saide: The Pope did not then gouerne. But nowe that those last dayes are past, and the Pope hath taken the whole regiment of the Church into his handes, the Church hath now declared, openly set forth, and established without retractation, That no man being married can bee holie, nor please God, for that is plaine vncleanenesse and fleshly defiling,Here aboue in the 1. & 2. lease. as we haue heretofore declared by plaine and special texts of the decrees.
                  
                     And therefore hath our deare mother the holie Church of Rome concluded and set forth, That it is much better, and lesse offence, for a Priest to vse another mans wife, than to marrie one of his

owne, after that he hath once accepted and married our deare mother the holy Church for his wife during his life: as Phigius, Eckius, Ioachimus Perionius, and other like pillars of the holy church of Rome, haue verie finelie set out in their writing.
                  
                  Yea, we do finde by daily experience, that the holie Catholike church of Rome will a great deale rather suffer, that these holie sheete Nonnes of Cloisters, and such like should (being with child) destroy it in their bodies with drinkes and other medicines,Nonnes murther their owne children. yea or kil it after it is borne, than that they should (according to the counsell of Saint Paule) marrie a husband.
                  
                     This visitation and that which was founde there is written by Iohn Ball an English writer in the argument of his booke of the life and conuersation of Popes. Iohn Pontan in his booke de immanitat

                           . Cap. 6.Which thing was apparant at the visitation of the Cloisters in England, which King Henrie .8. caused to be done throughout all England, where manie priuies in Cloisters were found full of the bones of yong children, with manie other abhominable matters, which are not meete to bee rehearsed.
                  And Iouianus Pontanus, a good Catholike, and a well learned man, doth likewise witnesse, that it is a common practise of these holie Religious women, to doe such thinges.
                  
                     It is likewise found in ancient credible histories,This is writtē by Huldrick bishop of Augsbridg in a letter which he sent vnto Pope Nicholas 1. about the yeere 265. treating of this matter. That Saint Gregorie Bishop of Rome, after he had first set foorth a verie straite commaundement against the marriage of Priestes, did afterwarde repeale and call backe againe the same verie earnestlie, lamenting and repenting verie sore his former doing: because, that sending vpon a time to his pondes to haue some fishe taken, there was drawen out of the same with the nettes, and brought to him, aboue sixe thousande heades of yong children, which he straight wayes did with sighes and lamentations acknowledge to haue bene so murthered, by reason of his said commaundement.
                  But our deare mother the holie Church, who hath not lightly anie respect to such small matters, as that, although she heares of inough such: yea, and doth daily see them before her eies, and is often times put in remembrance of them: yet shee had much rather ouersee and suffer such thinges to bee done, then to consent that those holie Nonnes, which haue professed chastitie, should marrie. I doe not speake of it, that shee will rather looke thorowe the fingers,Peruse the 11. chap. of the second part. or winke at the abominable & filthie

Sodomitrie of Monkes and Friers, than she will reuoke and call backe againe her holy commaundement for chastitie: notwithstanding that Pope Pius the seconde himselfe, hath oftentimes acknowledged, that although the forbidding of Priests to marrie, was done vpon great consideration: yet it must now vpon other consideration of greater importance, be set at libertie againe. But this is their first rule, and ABC, that they learne as soone as euer they are admitted Priestes, or professed Monkes or Friers, and that they continually harpe vpon this string, Si non castè, tamen cautè: which is thus ment, That if they cannot liue chastly, yet they shall vse it so secretly, as that it be not much talked of, nor knowne.
                  
                  And now after this, to prouide so for the matter, that these holie Fathers should not go to grossely to worke, therefore hath our deare mother the holie Church, laid an ordinance before her spouses, the Priests and Spiritualtie, that they might freely vse other mens wiues, & that all women ought to be common for them. Whereby men may well consider, that she is none of these gealous wiues, which cannot be content,

that their husbandes shoulde once make a good countenance to another woman: for she is well contented that her sweete husbandes, to witte, Priestes and Monkes, shoulde vse all women at their pleasure. Yea moreouer, she will mainteine, that it ought to be so: and so goeth about to establishe it, with plaine textes of the holie Scripture, besides the worthie witnesse which shee doth borrow out of the heathen Philosophers. For consider, these bee the proper wordes of the holy father Pope Clement, whom the Church doth esteeme to haue bene a successour of Peter: and therefore hath she caused these his wordes (which are worthie of perpetual memorie, to be written vpon the doores of all Cloysters, and Spirituall houses) to bee set in her booke of decrees, as a woodden diamond might be set in a laten ring, where he saith:
                  
                     Deare brethren, to liue in common is verie necessarie for all men,
                     This is euen thus set downe word for worde in the decrees Cap. D

                     but most specially for those which will stoutely, and warily fight vnder Gods banner, and counterfeit or follow the example of the Apostles & their disciples. For the same by nature ought so to bee, and all

things in the world ought to bee common: but the wickednesse of man hath bene the occasion, that the one hath begonne to say: This is mine, the other said, And this belongeth to me: And by that meanes, dealing or participating of all things crept in. To bee briefe, a verie wise man amongst the Grekes hath spoken maruellous well,
                     
                        Pythagoras whō 
                        Plato did imitate in the goue

                        nement of his citie. 
                     saying: All things are common amongst good friendes. Nowe it is then without doubt, that vnder the name of all things, the wiues are likewise conteined: For like as the light and the shining of the Sunne can not be separated nor parted,
                     Married women common. 
                     euen so there cannot likewise anie separation or dealing be made of that which is to bee vsed in common: but it ought to be generallie at the commaūdement of euerie one of the companie. And for that cause it is, that God saith (gentle Reader note wel here speciall textes of the Scriptvre) by his Prophet,Psal. 133.1. saying: O what a goodlie and pleasant a thing it is, for brethren to dwell together. And this custome being obserued by the Apostles, so must they haue all together liued with one an other in cōmon:
                     Act. 4.32. 
                     like as it is written: The multitude of the beleeuing was one

heart, and one soule, &c.
                  
                  Note here the determination & conclusion of our deare mother the holy church worde by word. whereby shee doeth absolutelie conclude out of the holie Scriptures, that these Heretikes, which are alway in hand with the scriptures, haue now no more cause to complaine, though the Priests & Friers will sometime (euen for loue) borrow some of their wiues, for the mainteining & knitting together of this holy Clements commontie. And although the glosse thervpon say, That this hauing of women in cōmon is not to be vnderstood, after the vse of the flesh, but simplie for the good willingnesse & charitable loue towards the congregation: yet notwithstanding, the text is plain inough, which saieth, That men must be conuersant with them, as the light is with the sunne shine, which do continually enioy one another. And the same is established, by the doctrine of Plato and Pythagoras, who speciallie were of opinion, that all women should bee common. And that is apparant inough, by the daylie exercise thereof: for you see that the Priestes may haue no wiues of their owne, but doe

vse all women in generall, when, or wheresoeuer they can get them. But yet they wil not looke so narrowlie to haue things common as touching their goods, because euerie one of them will looke to enioy his own goodes, but not his owne wife: so that it is rather done for the wiues, than for anie thing else.
                  
                     And this may likewise verie well bee the occasion, wherefore the Romishe Church (which in deede can be but one particular Church, because that Rome is but one particular towne) is yet called The Catholike church,
                     For what cause the Church of Rome is called Catholike. 
                     that is, The common & generall Church ouer all, which specially proceedeth by reason of that goodly common sort of women, and boyes, which she mainteines, and doeth increase and multiplie her generation ouer all the world: yea, and filles the whole face of the earth with her young Priests and Monkes, whereof shee hath made such a number, as there are flies in the Summer: in so much that shee may iustly bee called Ecclesia oeccomenica: that is to say, The Church that doeth flowe ouer the whole earth, like a spring tide.

                  All this you may see set out at large in the foresaid booke of Durandus,
                     In the 23. and 77. Dist. and in the booke of Sentences, & in the fourth councels of Tolledo and Carthago, & likewise

in the Decrees. So that it is apparant, that all these holie orders are fished out of the bottome and ground of the scriptures, and are founded vppon the examples of Christ: notwithstanding nowe, that the Priestes haue somewhat the more prerogatiue then Christ had, so that they can pushe through all these seuen orders at one time, or else skippe ouer foure or fiue of thē at once. For they that can once get the shauen crowne on their heades, (which is the character, marke, & token of the worthie order of Priesthoode) may not then onelie proceede to be Priestes, but also to be Bishops and Cardinals, and to gette sackes full of benefices: for our most holie father the Pope may freelie dispence with all such matters, as it pleaseth him. But that carieth his authoritie in the Popes foundation, which wee haue here before set forth and declared to be so strong, as the diuels of hell are not able to withstand it.Peruse the 11. chap. of the 2. part. For this time wee doe onelie teache, that when soeuer it shall please the holy church to vse the seuen orders orderlie, shee is able to establish the whole heape of them trimlie and finelie out of the scripture.
               
               
                  
                  The xix. Chapter. VVherein is concluded, that all the ceremonies of the holie Church of Rome, are founded vppon the Scripture, if they be well vnderstoode, and according to their interpretation which onelie is to bee esteemed so good: and what aduantage they haue, that stande fast to this interpretation. And herein is likewise mention made of the masse, and of maister Durandus booke.
                  
                     Ceremonies of the holy Churches in general.YEa, shee doeth nothing in the world, either of great or small importance, but it is all so finelie founded vppon the Scripture, as can bee deuised. And that may appeare by this: That shee hath fetched the golden slippers, and the precious breeches of our most holie Father the Pope out of the Scriptures. For it is written: O howe faire and pleasaunt are the feete of those, which bring tidinges of peace,
                     Esaie. 52.7. Rom. 10.18. This expositiō is set downe by Durandus in his booke called. Rationale diuinorum officiorum chap. 7. Num 8. Slippers and breeches of the Popes. 
                     which bring good tidings: which after their interpretation is as much to say, as, That the feete and legges of the Pope of Rome, must be decked with goodlie golden slippers, and with maruellous rich and costlie breeches: as it is well set forth by the holie Doctour & Bishop Durandus. And therevpon it proceedeth likewise, that the Pope doeth suffer Kings & Emperours to kisse his feete: yea, to treade

vppon the Emperour Frederiks necke, as is before declared.Seeke the 10. chap. of the 2. part. And the rather his feete are to be kissed, because they are so faire & pleasant, and smell so sweete, especiallie two or three dayes after he is dead: for then come all the deuoute catholike people, and kisse them bare, whereby they obteine a verie great indulgence and pardon.

hee were daunsing the Maides Morice: Why hee heaues or liftes vppe his voyce sometime like a chimnie sweeper, and by and by hee is as still and quiet againe, as it were a mouse in a trappe: why sometime hee foldeth his handes together, like sorrowfull Marie Magdalene, and sometime hee stretches them out on euerie side, as though hee would shoote in Robin Hoodes bowe: and then sodenlie hee pluckes them in againe, and tosseth them from the one side to the other, as though hee were catching of flies, or would fraye and scarre awaye crowes.
                  After this hee doeth set foorth verie perfectlie, and in particular, all the occasions and reasons, wherefore Sir Iohns Table is so earlie couered, and the Cup, the little Cannes, and the sauser so mannerlie set therevppon: and wherefore Sir Iohn doeth sometime sleepe at his table, and sometime starteth vppe sodenlie out of his dreame. Item, what it meaneth, that hee doeth runne and whisper his secretes to the breade and wine in their eares with a lowe & soft voyce, and that

his companions sometime crie out so yealling with open throates, like wolues in a caue, or like swine when the butcher killeth them: and wherfore some goe to work with Organes, other with ringing of bels, as though there were an vplandish bellie-feast towards, or some such triumphe. And wherefore men do in the meane space light torches, as though they were bringing the Bride to bedde: and wherefore they lift vp the Priests taile behind him, as though they would looke into his arse, to minister a glister to him.
                  And if you peruse that booke well, you shall likewise finde there, wherefore Sir Domine with his long smocke doth so lustelie lift vp on hie a wafer, and a cup of wine, and that then euerie bodie falleth downe vpon their knees, and knocketh vpon their breastes with their fistes: and wherefore the Priest beginneth then to looke so

                  And you shall (besides all this) beare wonders, of all the rest of the holie ceremonies of the Romish Church, which they do vse at their Mattēs, at noone, at euensong, at complen, and manie other times, with great deuotion, with all the gestures and fashions which they doe therein vse: and who haue deuised them all: and what euerie one of them doeth signifie. Hee can tell you more, all the feast dayes, and double feastes, all Vigils, Ember dayes, and fasting dayes, all dayes of fish and egges, all processions, goings about with the crosse, gange dayes, and all the whole brabling vsed through the yeere: all this hath hee euen at his fingers endes, and can bring in for euerie one of them, textes verie finelie founded out of the Scripture. So that I assure you, it is a pleasure for those that can heare it. Besides all this, you haue there set forth all the estate, pompe, and pranckings of our holy Bishops and Prelates,

especiallie, of our most holie father the Pope of Rome: whereof there is not one iotte forgotten nor left vnconsidered: yea surelie, I beleeue that his holinesse, sitting vpon his stoole of easement (sir reuerence of his holinesse) should not make one sowre or skornefull countenance, but this wise & profounde learned Doctour and Bishop, can straightwayes bring in for it some mysterie and weightie matter: And to bring a text of Scripture for it, which shall serue as fit for that purpose, as a sadle for a sowe. What needeth manie wordes? hee is a passing Apoticarie, hee can make a good medicine of a Cabadge stalke.
                  And therefore it is, that our deare mother the holy Church doeth so greatly esteeme this his booke,Durandus his booke. so that shee would not forgo it for anie good: and she hath reason for it because in deede it is her chiefe iewell or treasure, wherein all her holinesse is locked vp. Where will all these Heretikes now hide them selues, these Lutheranes, Huguenotes, Zwinglians, & Caluinistes, the one heape wt the other, which do bragge so much of the word of God? Let thē but once take this booke of Durādus into their hands, and they shall finde there,

that all the ceremonies of the holie church of Rome, all their prankings, and strange deuises, are finely founded vpon the Scripture, so that there is not one lacking: yea, and that the Scripture is wholie on our side, if it be right vnderstood, according to the meaning and interpretation of our deare mother the holie Church: to witte, that you passe ouer and let slippe the dead letter, and the plaine text, & depend wholie vpon the spirit of speculation of our Doctours of Louen, & those of Paris, which is only the spirit, That quickeneth & maketh aliue, as is heretofore rehearsed.
                  Therefore, let all such as wil be good and Catholike subiectes of the holie Church and Sea of Rome, holde fast and sticke to this interpretation, and in anie wise shrinke not from it: but beleeue all whatsoeuer the holy church beleeues, not once going about to knowe, or to aske any questiō what it is: because it is inough for them to know, that the church of Rome cānot erre, so long as she remaineth fast groūded vpon the foūdation of the Pope. Let them keepe in mind the saying of Salomon, You shall not remooue the pales & markes which your fathers haue planted: that is to say:Pro. 22, 28.
                     
                     You shall not once moue,
                     Thus doth Eckius and all other Catholikes expounde it. 
                     touche, or alter any thing of al that, which our deare mother the holie Church of Rome hath established and ordeined. And dooing thus, they shalbe her white sonnes, & haue the worlde at will, they shall enioye the goods of this worlde: some shall become Bishops, and some Cardinalles, riding brauelie to the Courtes of Popes and Kings vpon braue horses and Mules, and shal haue the fairest Courtisanes of Rome at their commaundementes.
                  In summe, they shall say to them selues, What canst thou desire? Where contrariwise, these felowes will bee so nosewise, that they will knowe all things, and will beleeue nothing, but iust that which they finde in Scripture, and in their Bible plainlie set out: yea, they doe mocke our deare mother, & the interpretations which shee bringeth forth vpon the Scriptures But those surelie are Heretikes to the fourth generation: as Doctours and Physicions say, Euen to the hiest steppe of the staires. For like as Master Gentian hath here finely concluded, They do not beleeue the holie Church, They beleeue not the twelue articles of our faith: yea, they doe

not beleeue the holie scripture, seeing they will not accept the interpretation of the scripture, which the holie Church hath allowed for good: And therefore, they must be banished, accursed, and excommunicated: yea, they must be burnt to ashes and powder, if they will not recante. For that is the sure sentence and resolute determination of our holie mother the Church of Rome, wherein doeth not fall anie stay or appellation, for that nowe from henceforth they will not, nor shall not beare with them anie longer. And herewith we will make an ende of the second part, hauing emptied this distaffe: and nowe (by master Gentianus leaue) we will in hande and proceede with another part.
               
            
         
         
            
            Here followeth the exposition vpon the third part of Gentianus Haruets Epistle: wherin is treated of Auricular confession, of the Sacraments, of Matrimonie, of Confirmation, and of the holy Anointment.
            
               The first Chapter. Of Auricular confession, and howe necessarie it is, and of establishing the same by the Scriptures.
               
                  Auriculer confession.
                  HEre now doth followe the third part of the Epistle of Gentianus, wherein he doth declare himself greatlie to wonder, that these new Preachers of the gospell will go about to abolish auricular confession. Cockes populorum! But howe would they go to worke? Where our holie mother hath so straightlie cōmanded vpon paine of damnation,These are the very wordes of Pope Innocent the 1. in a generall councell cō
                     cluded, and is set down in the decrees, Chap. Omnis vtriusque sext
                           •
                        s de penietentis & remissionibus.
                   That al such as are of both kindes, to wit, male & female, shall assoone as he or she is come to yeeres of discretion, confesse them selues to their owne Curate of all their sins, at lest once a yere: vnderstanding the same alway of deadlie sinnes only, as is set forth by the glosse vpon the text: because daily and perdonable sinnes are with a Pater noster, or with a

sprinckle full of holy water, cleane washed away.
               I maruell, howe these Heretikes can speake against this. For were it not euen as much as though they would put out both the eies of our mother the holie church? For vndoubtedly, this auricular confession is worthe two paire of eies to her. For by the one, she can see, perceiue & learne al the secret determinations, counsels, and pretences of all Kings, Princes and Potentates of Christendome: by reason whereof she is come to a peaceable possession & enioying of her authoritie and gouernement ouer all Countries and Kingdomes: And by the other she can see and creepe euen into the verie bottome of the bosomes of yong maides, simple and sorrowful wiues, and widdowes, and so grope out and vnderstand all their secrets: and then enioyne them such friendlie penaunce, that their troubled consciences are thereby comforted, and their sorrowfull heartes made ioyfull. O good Lord! How often haue these holy Priests and Friers giuen (vnder confession) good wholesome counsell to the sorrowfull barren wiues, whereby they haue afterwardes become blyth mothers,

and haue euer after borne an inward loue towardes their holie ghostlie fathers, euen as though it were to their owne husbands.
               Yea, there is at this present a good holie graie Frier at Brudgesse, called Brother Cornelius the Whipper, who (by meanes of this holie auriculer confession) did teach a great many of simple womē, to tame and mortifie their fleshe, in this manner: That they for the fulfilling of penance to them inioyned, and to receiue of him ful absolution of their sinnes, haue verie willinglie gon creeping vppon handes and feete, starke naked before that holie ghostlie father: and when he did marke anie that the fleshe was not sufficientlie mortified, them did he followe with a rodde in his hand, and whipped thē vpon the bare buttockes, till they had thereby done sufficient penance.
               By the same token, that hee is yet at this houre called, Brother Cornelis the whipper, and is verie well beloued in the towne of Brudgesse, where the women are verie deuoute to do such penance.
               Consider now, if that auricular confessiō had bene pulled downe, howe could he haue brought those good women to such a deuout

mortification and penaunce? Howe shoulde our deare mother the holie Church bring into the right path, that goodlie and friendly congregation of women, whiche Pope Clement did commaunde, if it were not by that holie auriculer confession? So that truely, Nectarius Bishop of Constantinople was muche to blame,
                     Nectarius.
                   for disanulling auriculer confession, onelie because there was a Deacon or a Priest, whiche had shreeuen a woman vnder her smocke.In the yeare 395. Was not that a straunge matter of the Bishoppe?This is set out in the storie tripar
                        •
                     ite in the .9. booke. Chap. 28. Surely he must needes haue bene either a Lutherian or a Huguenote, seing he had no more regarde too the ordinaunces of his deare mother the holie Church. But I assure you, it goeth now to worke after an other manner, what woulde that Bishoppe haue done, if he had seene brother Cornelis the whipper, and such other good felowes, Surely he would haue driuen auriculer confession with all that baggadge to the gallowes.Chrisostome vpon the .51. Psal. and in the 3. Homelie vppon the .12. chap. to the Hebr. And in the Homelie of penaunce. &c. Seing he was so earnestly moued for such a smell matter. But we will let him alone with a morren. And although Chrisostome was of the same opinion, and did directly withstande auriculer confession, yet notwithstanding

we haue nothing to do therwithal, we will sticke to and keepe fast our auricular confession: yea, and though all the Doctours of the Churche, shoulde runne madde. For when all is saide, it were almost as good that the Masse should be put downe and buried for euer, as that there shoulde be no auricular confession. Our deare mother the holie Church will take heede to that, she wil not put downe nor suffer to be ouerthrowen, such a trimme and necessarie thing as that is, to please these Heretikes: especially seeing she can defende it by holy Scripture, aswell as any article before specified, as you may clearly see out of the doctrine of Maister Gentianus Haruet.
               
               
                  Iohn. 20.28.
                  Is it not written, (saith he,) Whose sinnes soeuer you doe forgeue, the same shall be forgeuen. Now they cannot forgeue without hauing knowledge first of the matter: and the matter cannot come to anie knowledge, but by confession, made either openly or in secrete. And therefore without doubt (sayth he) auricular or secrete confession is muche more comly and honest, than open cō
                     fession. Consider well of this matter

(gentle Reader,) here the matter is so cleare, that a blinde man may see it aswell in the darke as without a candle. For notwithstanding that Christ speakes there of ministring & preaching the gospel,Whose sinnes you remit, &c. whereby the forgiuenesse of sins is pronounced vnto all those that beleeue: as he himselfe doth expounde it, saying: That Paule shall open the eyes of the blinde,
                  Act. 26.18. 
                  to the end they may turne from the darkenesse, to the light, and from the power of the diuel, vnto God, so that they may obteine forgiuenesse of their sinnes, and so bee partakers with them, whiche are by beliefe in Iesus Christ, made holie. Whervpon Paule plainely sayeth, That he hath folowed this commaundement, not by confessing of women secretly in their eares, but by preaching and setting foorth of the Gospell, and the forgiuenesse of sinnes. And whereas Chrysostome and all the olde Fathers haue so vnderstoode and set it foorth: yet notwithstanding,Chrysostome vpon the .23. of Mathewe the .44. homilie. since that the holie Churche hath vnburthened all Bishops, Priestes, Ministers, and Officers of the Church, of their charge of preaching, and haue geuen the same to images and Sainctes made of stockes and stones, to

be bookes and preachers to the Laie people. The time and matter is much altered: And the priestes beginne to finde a good taste in this auriculer confession. They haue blowen this forgeuing of sinnes in at the eares. They geue thee absolution with a Crosse, alledging and setting foorth the woordes of Christ, for proofe thereof. So that it is not to be merueiled at, that our Maister Gentian doeth so glorie of this Text, and will with that plainly prooue auriculer confession: Notwithstanding that the holie Churche hath many other cleare Textes of the Scripture, whereby to proue and establish the same.
               As for example: whereas Christ sayde to the Lepre, after that he had made him whole:Mathew. 8.4. Marke. 1.44. Luke. 5.14. This witnesse is by Eckius and all other Catholike writers interpreted to this sence. 
                  Goe and shewe thy selfe to the Priest, and offer thine offering according as Moises hath commaunded. For that is onely thus to be vnderstood: Goe hence and shriue thy selfe vnto thine owne Ghostly Father, and doe such penance, as he shall enioyne you. And the like,Iames. 5.26. where Saint Iames saith, Confesse your sinnes one to an other, By that did Iames meane nothing else, but onely seeke you out a Priest or a Frier, to whom you

may open your minde, and declare vnto him perticulerly al your euil deedes, and he will quickly geue you absolution, especially, if you let him see a peece of golde. For (by interpretation of our deare mother the holy Churche) One to an other, is as muche to say, as the Priestes and Friers onely. And therefore, where Sainte Iames following right in the same place saith, And pray one for an other, we may very well vnderstand that thus, as though he would say: Pray onelie for Friers and Priestes, that the world may be cleane cleansed of them, and Purgatorie filled with them.
               
            
            
               The .2. Chapter. Treating of the Sacrament of seuen orders, & of matrimonie, & of the holie oyle or oyntment, and of the number of the .vii▪ Sacramentes.
               AFter this commes Maister Gentianus to the rest of the Sacramentes,The Sacramēt of seuen orders and sayeth thus: As touching the seuen orders, is there not a playne Texte in Saint Paule where hee sayeth:
                  1. Tim. 4.14 
                  Doe not neglect that which is in thee, whiche is geuen thee by prophesie, and laying on of handes of the Priesthood,
                  Looke the .18. Chap. of the .2. part. 
                  for that is asmuch to say, as Take good heede and

see that you doe not take vppon you to be masse Priestes,
                  Looke the 19. Chap. of the .1. parte. 
                  before you haue bene Porter, Candle bearer, Chorister, or Acoluthus, Subdeacon and Deacon, for all these must goe before, if you wil haue the other to followe, as we haue heretofore declared by scriptures.
                  The Sacramēt of matrimonie.
               
               Then he doth further declare, that matrimonie is a sacrament,Ephes. 5.32. bicause there is written: This is a greate mysterie, I say in Christ Iesus, and the congregation. But I could be very well content, that gentle Gentianus, had helde his tongue there, and neuer haue written so. It is verye true, that our deare mother the holie church hath bene accustomed heretofore, to bring in the same for a testimonie or witnesse, before that the common sorte had read or were acquainted with the scriptures: but now the time doth not serue any longer to geue men brickbattes for turfes, or to make them beleeue that the Moone is made of greene Cheese: for euerie one will pretend now to know how the world walkes. Therefore he had better haue held his tongue touching this matter. For, to begin withal, an Asse might haue seene and perceiued, that Paule dooth not

there meane anie thing at all of matrimonie: but of the vnitie betweene Christ and his congregation: which he doth name to be A greate or deepe mysterie farre aboue the vnderstanding of all men. And besides this, these scornefull Heretikes, will sowe a paire of Asse eares on maister Gentianus head: seeing he did not consider, That herein he doth speake both against himselfe, and against our deare mother the holie Churche, who hath plainly concluded that matrimonie is fleshly, vncleane, and vnholy: and hath for that cause forbidden, that Priestes shall marrie, insomuch,Looke the 17. Chap. of the 
                        •
                      parte. that it cannot be a holie Sacramente: or else it muste followe, that Priestes are not woorthie to enioye so holie a Sacrament. And besides that, these Heretikes will set a paire of spectacles on maister Gentianus nose, to the ende hee may see and perceiue, that if it be so, that Matrimonie bee a Sacramente, then must virginitie or maidenhoode much rather be a holie sacrament, bycause that by our deare mother the holy Church it is much more esteemed thā matrimony, & so there must be eight sacraments. Yea, widowes will come in for their partes,

and challendge viduitie or widowehoode to be a sacrament. So that men shall at the last be forced to regester for sacramentes, all states and calling of men. Wherevpon must needes follow, that our deare mother the holy church hath erred in setting foorth & teaching, that there were onely seauen sacramentes, vnlesse that shee (peraduenture) will haue it vnderstoode, that by the number of seauen shee dooth meane an innumerable number, as by Gentianus reasons appeareth shee dooth, so that by his argument it must followe, That in all places of the scripture, where this woord Misterium, that is to say a misterie is vsed, that must streight way bee esteemed for a sacrament: and by that order, also must the kingdome of Antichrist and the beast with seauen heades be accompted for sacramentes: So that in the end, we should haue so many sacramentes, that we shoulde not know what to doe with them: but we must go set them out in the Sunne to dry, or lade a great Hulke with them, and send them into Norway: which out of doubt were a greate disorder, and such as might make open to al the worlde the impudencie and shamefulnesse of our

deare mother the holy church of Rome: seeing shee hath resolutely set foorth, that there may be no moe but seauen sacramentes. Which thing she hath likewise fetched out of the coffer of the scriptures with hir Allegoricall or Anagogicall key (saith shee) Seuen deadly sinnes.
                  Looke the .1. chap. of the .2. parte. 
                  Ergo must there be of necessitie seuen Sacramentes, which must driue away and ouercome the same seuen deadly sinnes. Item there is mention made of seuen Seales, wherewith the booke of the olde Testament was sealed vp. Also there were seuen pillars, wherewith the church was vnderset: how like are they to be the seuen principall of the new Bishops of the base countrey to wit,Seuen bishops in the low countreis Vigilius.
                   The Cardinall Grandwell, the President Viglius, Franciscus, Sonnius, Petrus Cursius, Ioannes Lindanus de castro and Fryer Kniefe, Who (I assure you) sticke to their tackling and holde vppe the Romish Church like faste and sure pyllers and proppes for feare shee should fall into the myre. After this likewise is mention made of Seuen washings whereby Naaman was healed of his leprosie, and likewise of seuen Basens,

For now (saith our mother the holy church) by all these are signified and set foorth the seuen doctours of the Romish church, to wit, the foure principall of the scholasticall theologie or diuinitie, as Thomas de Aquino, Ioā
                     nes Scotus, Albertus Magnus, and Occam, together with the two profound interpreters of the masse, namely Rabanus and Durandus, and the Maister of the Sentences called Petrus Lombardus: all which make iust seuen, who should likewise set forth and establish in the church of Rome seuen sacramentes.
               
               There may yet be alledged many other examples for the establishing of the number of seuen Sacraments, to wit, the seuē Psalmes, which serue the soules in Purgatorie for seuē sacramentes.Matth. 12. Luke. 11. Item the seuen diuels which cam to inhabit the house when they found it cleane & emptie: then the seuen sciences: and also the seuen or fiue wittes of our Doctours of Louen, wherewith

they farre excell all the profounde wit and vnderstanding of the Apostles and Prophets, with many other thinges more, which might be broght in: but our mother the holie church of Rome is satisfied with these examples and figures before specified. Although yet me thinkes (vnder correction of my maisters of Louen be it spoken, to whose iudgements I submitte my selfe) that the number of the seuen Sacramentes may best be applied (for that which is written in the Apocalypse, of the beast with seuen heades: or (as heretofore is set foorth) Irenaeus himselfe hath applied this beast to the Romishe churche.

                     s makes together. 666. Apoc. 13.17. doe agree very well in one wt this Greke worde EKKΛHΣIA ITAΛIKA, Ecclesia Italica, which is to say, The Italian or Romish Church. And there is likewise specially spoken of the Character, or marke of the beast: And now our mother the holy church sayth that there is likewise a Charecter or marke in the sacraments. And last of al it is credibly affirmed that it is a mysterie: to wit, Babylon: And nowe will our deare mother cō
                  clude, as is apparāt, that matrimonie is a

Sacrament because that this woorde misterium is playnely set foorth: and then it must of necessitie followe, that here also somewhat is spoken of Sacramentes, seeyng that this woorde is likewise spoken of here. And so must the beast with seuē heads, vndoubtedly betoken and signifie the Romish church with her seuen Sacramentes, and with her character or marke. So that maister Gentianus is herein to be blamed, That he hath (to mainteine his argument) vsed this worde misterium for the purpose of matrimonie to be a sacramēt: cōsidering that our deare mother the holie Church hath alwaies vsed the same for her strōgest bulwarke, alledging the same continually,
               But herevpon yet might fall out a great question, to wit, how doeth it happen, that men accompt vpon no more, but seuen sacramentes, seeing that yet our deare mother the holie Church hath ordeined at the least seuen and seuentie Sacramentes, whereof none is conteined vnder anie of these seuen? For on Easter eeuen, when they do blesse the Easter candels, then doth the holie Church offer vnto God the Father Fier, for a great rewarde and a holie Sacrament,Fire a Sacrament. saying thus:
               
                  
                  Te in tuis operibus inuocantes in hac sacratissima noctis vigilia, de donis tuae suppliciter offerimus Maiestati, non adipe carnis pollutum, non prophana vnctione viciatum, non sacrilego igne contactum, sed cera atque stuppa constructum, in tui nominis honore succenssum ignem, obsequio religiosae deuotionis offerimus. Magnum igitur Mysterium, & noctis huius mirabile Sacramentum, dignis necesse est laudibus cumulari.
               
               That is to say:
               
                  Calling vpon thee in thy workes, this holie Eeue of Easter, we offer most humbly vnto thy Maiestie, this sacrifice: namely, a fire not defiled with the fat of fleshe, nor polluted with vnholie oyle or oyntment, nor attainted with anie prophane fire: but we offer vnto thee, with obedience, proceeding from perfect deuotion, a fire of wrought waxe & weeke, kindled and made to burne in the honour of thy name. This so great a mysterie therefore, and the maruellous sacrament of this holie Eeue, must needes be extolled with due and deserued praises.
               
               Marke well nowe, here is the holy fire, or else surelie the Eeue it selfe, called (not

onlie Mysterium) but also A maruellous Sacrament, and offered vp vnto God for a great present, whereby he is (as in the end is concluded) made verie ioyfull & merie.
               
                  The finding of the Crosse, a sacrament.Likewise, the signe of the Crosse is also called a Sacrament. For vppon the day called Inuentio sanctae crucis, that is, The finding out of the holie crosse, are song by our deare mother the holie church, in a certeine metricall sequence, these words:

                     Non sunt noua Sacramenta,
                     Nec recenter est inuenta
                     Crucis haec Religio.
                     Ista dulces aquas fecit,
                     Per hanc Silex aquas iecit,
                     Mosis officio.
                     Nulla salus est in domo,
                     Nisi Cruce munit homo
                     superliminaria.
                  
               
               That is to say:

                     This is no newe made Sacrament,
                     Nor holie crosse doeth represent
                     a late vpstart inuention:
                     This crosse made bitter water sweete,
                     And floudes from rocke of flint to fleete,
                     by Moses priestly function.
                     All health and wealth is turnd to losse,
                     in euerie house and houshold,
                     
                        Except the signe of holie crosse
                     be set vpon the threshold.
                  
               
               So that the signe of the Crosse must also be a holie sacrament without doubt.
               And the like, when they make holie water, they pray thus:
               
                  Deus, qui ad salutem humani generis maxima quaeque Sacramenta in aquarū substantia condidisti, adesto propitius inuocationibus nostris, & elemento huic multimodis purificationibus praeparato, virtutem tuae benedictionis ✚ infunde: vt creatura Mysterii tui tibi seruiens, ad abiiciendos daemones, morbosque pellendos, diuinae gratiae sumat effectum, &c.
               
               That is to say:
               
                  O God, who hast (for the health of mankind) ordeined and made manie sacramentes of the substance of water, accept mercifullie our prayers, and sende into this water (which is by manie meanes made cleare) the vertue of thy blessing ✚: So that this creature of thy sacrament seruing thee, may receiue perfect strength and power, to chace away diuels, and to driue away all diseases & sicknesses, &c.
               
               
                  
                  Water a Sacrament.Here is the water likewise called Creatura mysterii: so that it must needes bee a sacrament, seeing that A Sacrament is nothing els, but a holie signe of anie holie thing:
                  The Maister of sentences in the .1. chap. the dist. and .4. booke. or▪ 
                  A visible similitude or likenesse of anie inuisible grace or pardon. So that it may iustlie bee said, Accedat verbum ad elementum, & fiet Sacramentū: that is to say: When the worde is ioyned with the element, it is made a Sacramēt. And now, out of doubt, here is an element, to wit, the water: And herevppon commes the wordes of the Priests, by which it doth receiue a gratious power, to participate vnto men an vnuisible gift, euen as well as the holie oyntment, or anie other sacrament of the holie church, ergo is it likewise a sacrament. And herevppon it doeth followe, that the holie ashes also is no lesse. Item▪ the Priestes spittle. Item, the Palmes. Item, the waxe candels, and all other elementes, which our deare mother the holie church doeth likewise consecrate, hallowe and blesse, to the ende they may assist men by some inward power: all such must likewise be sacramentes. Make the reckoning then, and note whether wee shal not haue a notable companie of sacraments.
               
                  And whereas some men will say herevpon, that there is, or must be a difference betweene these, and the seuen sacraments:
                     Henricus de V
                           ••
                        
                        maria vpon the foresaide texte of the sentences because that the seuen sacramentes doe not onelie betoken things, but do also of themselues minister mercie and grace, and that the other can not of them selues giue anie grace, neither be the occasion of anie: that is plaine blasphemie against the holie church: as is euidentlie to be seene out of the lectures, readinges, and exorcismies or coniurations, which she doeth vse ouer the saide elementes, whereby they doe receiue as great power at the least, as anie of all the seuen Sacramentes haue: as you may plainly see in the Masse booke. Otherwise men might say that all her lectures or readinges and exorcismies or coniurations, were vnnecessarie, without power, and of no value: whiche is plaine blasphemie. And if men woulde say then, that all these small Sacramentes are conteined vnder the Sacramēt of penaūce, seing that satisfaction is included vnder penaunce, and that al these do tend to the doing of satisfactiō for our sins, & therfore are cōteined vnder satisfactiō: that woulde not sound well: for this alegation woulde alway be brought in against it, that baptisme and the holie

oyle or oyntment, and Confirmation, with all the rest of the sacraments, must all likewise be conteined vnder penaunce: seeing all they (as is heretofore declared) doe iustifie men Ex opere operato, or by the merites of good workes, and so are reckoned for good payment and satisfaction. And therfore as touching this matter, wee must conclude thus: That this remaineth onlie at the will and discretion of our deare mother the holie Church of Rome: so that shee may ordeine and establishe as manie sacramentes as she list, and in the meane space make vs beleeue that there are no more but seuen. And so might it well bee said, that the number of seuen is here to be vnderstood for an endles number, as hath bene written before.
               And nowe, as touching the holie oyntment, wherewith they do vse to anoint the sicke, when they lie a passing, Gentianus doeth establish that verie finelie by scripture, as specially, where Saint Iames saith: If there be anie sicke among you, let him sende for the Elders of the congregation, and let them pray ouer him, and anoint him with oyle, in the name of the Lord: and the prayer of the faithfull

shal comfort the sicke, and the Lord shall restore him: and if he haue sinned, it shalbe forgiuen him. Whereby our holie mother doeth vnderstand, that whensoeuer anie bodie lies a passing, so that there is no more hope of life in him, the Prieste shal then anoint him with holie oyle, blesse him with crosses, and coniure him with certein words, and then he can neuer come in hell: for all the diuels will runne away from before the crosses, like a dogge before a fli

                  che of bacon. And therefore must hee take vp his lodging, either in the suburbes of hell, or in Purgatorie, where hee shall haue his house hire and firewood free, till such time, as he (with soule Masses and Popes pardons) haue gotten a platte of ground in heauen, to build a house thervppon, of merites and good workes. And this same oyle is of such power, that through it all our sinnes are forgiuen vs, according to that which the Priestes mumble out in their Masse:In the Masse booke. 
                  Per istam sanctam vnctionem & piissimam suam misericordiam, indulgeat tibi Deus, quicquid peccasti per visum, per aud itum, odoratum, tactum, & gustum, &c. that is to say, Thorough this holie oyntment, and by his

meeke mercie, will God forgiue thee all thy sinnes, what soeuer thou hast committed, by seeing, by hearing, by smelling, by feeling, and by tasting, &c.
               
               Consider nowe, what can you looke for more to enioye by the pretious bloud shedding of Iesus Christ the sonne of GOD, than that, which the Priestes doe beare vs in hand to giue vs, by the power and vertue of their holie oyle? These Heretikes may (if they will) hold f
                     •
                  st on the offering vp of the bodie and bloud of Iesus Christ: but the good Catholike subiectes of the holie church of Rome, will in no wise forsake this holie oyntment. We will rather bidde Christ him selfe Adieu, then wee will suffer such a pretious thing to be wroung out of our handes. It is verie true, that these Heretikes doe herein againe mocke with our deare mother the holy Church, saying, that our Priestes are like vnto Apes and Monkies, which will counterfeyte euerie thing that they see done before them, though they haue neither knowledge nor vnderstanding of the matter: and this doe they alledge hereof, because that Marke doeth witnesse,Mark. 6.13. That the Apostles had receiued the gifte of the holie Ghost, whereby

they did make the sicke whole with their prayers, and with anointing or laying on of handes, or by some other apparant token. As it doeth likewise appeare in Paule,1. Cor. 12.2
                        •
                     . who amongest other apparant giftes of the holy Ghost, did likewise deale with this gift of making the sicke whole: and he him selfe did shewe a notable token ouer the dead,Act. 20.10. falling vpon the dead carcase, and embrasing it in his armes: As we reade also of the Prophet Eliseus, who did the like ouer the dead childe,2. Reg. 4.34▪
                   stretching forth his feete and his handes, and set his mouth directlie on the mouth of the dead, and his eies on the eies of the dead: and so he with these notable tokens, iointlie with his deuoute prayers, did reuiue that dead carcase. But nowe, seeing there are no more such giftes amongst the Congregation (for that nowe the preaching of the Gospell hath no neede of anie newe establishing by signes and miracles) therefore will these Heretikes say, that it is but verie Apes plaie, to vse outwarde tokens, where they haue no inwarde power nor might, which may be shewed with the signe or token. For otherwise the Priestes must rubbe all blind mens eies with spitle and

clay, and stretche them selues out vpon all dead carcases: which were a verie beastlinesse, seeing they haue not the power to make the blinde see, nor to reuiue the dead: neither can they (with their oyle) make anie sicke man whole. And therefore they were better to burne the oyle in their lampes, or grease their bootes withall, rather than so to dissemble and mocke with God and his word: This talke these Heretikes haue, when they are gathered together: but we doe not passe for them one haire. For when wee shall finde anie of those, that would grease his shoes with that holie oyle or oyntment: yea, if he will not pray vnto it, and worship it vppon his knees, as though it were God him selfe, him we will burne in steade of oyle, and make a good fire of him▪ For we will stand vnto the wordes of Iames, & the example of the Apostles, whether we haue the power to make whole or no: we go foorth with our matter, euen as we also grease the childrens eyes with clay and spitle, although we haue not the power to make the blinde see: yea, and although the children are not blinde, it is inough for vs that our mother the holie Church hath so ordeined. Notwithstanding

it is here greatlie to bee noted, that maister Gentianus hath gone about to declare his innocencie herein, saying, that hee did bring this in onelie by manner of example, and as children playe in iest: For otherwise, if it were in earnest, hee would bring in other manner of stuffe: for hee could say so much to the matter, as hee would quicklie stoppe the mouthes of the Heretikes, as men may easilie iudge by his goodlie vtterance, and by his great learning, which doth appeare of him on all partes.
            
         
         
            
            Here doeth followe the declaration vpon the fourth parte of Maister Gentianus Epistle, treating of the praying to images: Howe they are holden and ordeined in the Churche of Rome: And also of this worde or name Idololatria, of the idolatrie of the Heathen, of praying to Saintes, and of the Sacrament, with suche other like matters.

                  THe fourth part is a weightie matter, and of greate importaunce, which doth make master Gentianus haue an vnquiet minde, as he himselfe doeth say: to wit, That these Heretikes haue no more respect vnto these olde and deuoute Catholike men, but for to esteeme them for seruers of false Gods, & worshippers of images, and do call them Idololatras that is, Idolaters. Alas, is not that greate pitie?

And are they not maruellous muche to blame?In the councell holden at Nicen in the 1. session in th

                      Anathematisme. whereas our deare mother the holie churche can in no wise beare with this name, nor heare of it: but hath finally concluded, commaunded, and ordeined, vpon paine to be banished, accursed, excōmunicated, & anathematized: That no man shall name her Saintes,
                  
                     Idola.
                   
                  by that same Greeke worde Idola, which is asmuch to say, as an image, or likenesse, yea, and hath flatlie determined, that from hencefoorth this same worde shall no more be taken properly for images or likenesses made after any man, or other thing to their worship, like as it hath euermore from time to time bene taken and vsed, aswel by the Greekes as Latinistes: but shall now be taken for nothing else, but onely for the false Gods of the Heathen or Iewes, and such images as they heretofore haue vsed in their Temples: Insomuch that the verie naturall and proper name and similitude of this worde, is wholy transubstantiated, and turned into an other substance and being.
               
               And therefore these Heretikes, are verie much to blame that they will come and plague our most deare mother, yet agayne

anewe, with this worde Idola, & say, that the good Catholike people, and Subiects of the holie church of Rome, are verie Idolaters, because they doe greatly esteeme, and woorshippe the images of our Ladie and of other holie Saintes, and doe kisse them and licke them, and trimme them vp, with goodlie garmentes and iewelles, (setting candles burning before them,) because they cannot see without candles, and cense them with sweete incense, and sing Hymnes and other songs of praises deuoutly before them: and because they carrie them about vppon their shoulders, for that they cannot goe themselues, and fall downe vpon their knees before them, and say to them, Our father which art in heauen. They set them vpon Altars, they go to them on Pilgrimage, to gette health and good lucke in their affaires, and doe euen as much worship to them, as the auncient Romanes, and Greekes, or as the Israelites did vnto their false Gods.
               Nowe vpon this these Heretikes say, that it is verie ill done of them, and will proue them to be verie idolaters and woorshippers of false Gods: but the blinde heretikes doe not perceiue that our images

are no idolles, but holie Saintes,Images are Saintes whiche doe manie and great miracles. Neither will they vnderstand, howe that our deare mother the holie churche of Rome hath commaunded vs so to doe. For all the holy catholike teachers haue verie friendly and ioyntlie concluded, that all images ought to be worshipped with like worshippe,
                     This historie is writen in the golden Legende. Also in the booke of Leander Albert of Boloigne, which he hath named the description of Italie in the 164. leafe of this booke printed in the yeare 1550.

                   as doth apperteine vnto such, after whome the said images are made, as the good and holie man Thomas de aquino hath plainely written. Yea, because that he did handle that matter so exactly, there was a crucifixe in the citie of Naples which spake to him, saying, Gentle Thomas thou hast written well and truely of me, what reward wouldest thou receiue? Wherevpō he did make answeare to the crucifixe, and saide: I will haue nothing else but euen thy selfe.
               
               Now whether the same crucifixe was of Gold, or siluer, (bicause he was so farre in loue with it aboue all other things) that I cannot tell, but I knowe very well, that hee hath written wonderfully for the aduauncement of prayer and woorship to be done to Images: and is for that cause likewise by Pope Iohn the .21. canonized

for a Saint. For he hath concluded (wherein our deare mother the holy Church doth likewise follow him) that whyle Christ is praied vnto with Latria,
                  
                     Latria.
                   which is to say after their interpretation, with the spirit as God: men shall likewise pray with Latria vnto his Image, which is with a cole, or with a Pencill painted vpon a wall, and likewise woorship it as God himselfe: if it be so, that it be painted with lōg haire and with a round Trencher behinde his heade, and holding vp his two fingers, and hauing the world with a crosse vpon it in his hand: for euen such a fellowe is the righte Saluator mundi.

               The worshipfull Maister Bonauentura doth likewise establish this matter: yea all the writers of the sentences haue generally so ordeined and concluded herevpon, insomuch that these Heretikes ought not now to doubt any more of the matter. Yet it is very true, that Durandus woulde not allowe of it, but did rather directly withstād it, saying plainly, that Images ought not to be prayed vnto, with the like honour as those after whome they were made or painted. But all the rest were offended with him, for that he refused to follow the

authorite of the holy church. And perhaps, if he had not written so as hee did, hee had been canonized, as well as Thomas de Aquino. Notwithstanding that a certeine Spaniard called Perezius, did followe him in that point, saying, That stones and blocks ought not to be praied vnto & worshiped wt

                  how muchsoeuer they be halowed or cōiured by any body. But he is far out of the way in this matter: For first wee knowe, that Saint Thomas de Aquino, was taught by Saint Peter and Saint Paule, so that he coulde not erre, and after that, hath our deare mother accepted his opiniō for the best. And wherfore shuld she not? For, seing that a simple priest can wt fiue words, of a little round cake, make a God: wherefore I pray you, should not a Bishop or a Suffragane make of a goodly gilded Image a God also? That were to put little trust in our deare mother the holy church. Therfore we must remain stedfast vpō the common opinion and iudgement of our deare mother the holy church of Rome. For a final end, the Heretiks do vs greate wrong to call vs seruers of false Gods,

worshippers of Images and Idolaters, euē as the Iewes do, who cānot find in their hartes, to bestow any honester name vppon vs. And therefore saith Maister Gentianus, that some good people, which see deper into the matter, mistrust that these Heretiks should haue some secret intelligence wt the Iewes: yea, should play bootie & be in pension with them, to maintein frendly conuersation with them, yet he addeth vnto it, that he for his part doth not beleeue any such thing, whereby it seemeth, that he woulde herein a little flatter and annoynte their mouthes with Honie, to please them withall: but it is not so, for hee speaketh in this behalfe, as doth become a good and stoute Catholike subiecte of the holy church of Rome. And besides that, he should haue done these Heretikes a great deale to much worship, if he shoulde haue yoked them in a Waggon, with the nation of the Iewes, who (as wee haue heretofore plainly set foorth) are the very best founders and chiefest fountaines and welsprings of all the ceremonies, and institutions of the holy Church of Rome.
               It is verie true, that our deare mother

hath amended them, and brought them into a better order, for that her wisdome and vnderstanding doeth farre exceede the wisedome of Moses and Aaron: And therfore hath shee in place of one temple of Solomon, caused to be builded vppon mountaines and hilles, and other hie places, aboue a hundred thousand: and in place of three or foure altars, which they had, shee hath set vp so manie, that they are not all to be told ouer in seuentie yeres. Although in deede (as before is rehearsed) the example and paterne doeth proceede from the Iewes, and is borrowed of them: which shadowes and figures our deare mother hath followed verie diligentlie.Heb. 9. throughout. Col. 2.17.18. Gal. 4.9.10. and so foorth.
               
               Therefore, whereas these Heretikes will (with the Apostle to the Hebrewes) defende and say, that all the figures and shadowes of the olde Testament were ended, and cleane taken away by the comming of Christ, and ought not to be vsed anie more, is rancke heresie. And truelie, they do therby sufficiētlie declare, that they haue no vnderstanding with the Iewes, neither in white nor blacke.The faith of the Iewes out of Moses lawe. For the Iewes hold that for the principall article and foundation of their beliefe, to wit, that the

lawe of Moses with all her ceremonies, & figures, shall neuer be taken away, nor altered, but shall continue in her Esse for euer, like as it doeth appeare by their teacher Rabbin Moses Henmaymon, who wrote a booke of the thirteene articles of their beleefe.
               
                  Ceremonies of the Lutherans.This tendeth likewise as right as a line, against the doctrine of the Lutherans and Zwinglians, who take vppon them to defende stoutlie, that men ought not to vse anie other ceremonies, than onlie such as Christ him selfe and his Apostles haue ordeined. And therefore will not they haue in their tēples anie altars, nor guilte images,1. Cor. 14.29. nor any other such like ceremoniall things: but will onlie, when as they are assēbled together, that nothing els shalbe done, than, like as Paule hath taught, after that euerie one hath soung a Psalme,1. Cor. 11.2.25. or declared some texte of Scripture, or some open declaration or exposition, and all tending to edifying:This is in the decrees chap. vasa. de consecra. dist. 1.

For she will (according to the maner of the Iewes) set foorthe her seruing of God brauely with gold and siluer: yea, the more that the religion, and the Gospell doe take 
                     •

with our deare mother the holie Churche of Rome, that they pisse both in one quill, and haue all studied in one schoole. But these Huguenotes will haue all thinges after their owne minde refourmed according to the Gospell, as it was in the time of the Apostles, and therefore wee will let them goe, with a good yeere, and holde vs fast to the Iewes. For our holy father the Pope himselfe doeth beare the Iewes verie good will,A synagoge of Iewes at Rome. and doeth shewe them all the friendshippe he can, or may. He doeth keepe a great many of them, in his citie of Rome, and lettes them haue one or two of the best streetes that bee there.
               
                  This taske hath authoritie without Italie. But within Italie is a pounde Turnoys changed to a pound Sterling.Yea, he is fast in their pension: for of euerie Iew that will haue a synagoge in his house, the Pope hath thirtie pounde Turnoys, which is seuen Ducates, and sixe sterlinges: and if they will haue licence to set vppe one openly, then the price is set vppe in the Popes reckoning chamber, at sixtie pounde Turnoys, which is fifteene Ducates. Note what fearefull blasphemie shoulde it then bee, to say, that the Huguenotes were in pension with the Iewes likewise, for that therevppon

it must needes followe, that they shoulde bee companions and brethren with our holy father the Pope: No,The Pope agreeth better with Iewes, Turkes, and Heathen, than with Huguenotes. no I warrant you, he can agree much better with the Iewes: yea, with the Turkes & Heathen, better than with the Huguenotes, which goe about to refourme his holy Sea, according to the Gospell: he can neither abide the sight nor smell of them▪ yea, and the matter is so farre gone, that he woulde allowe them an assemblie and meeting together, as he doeth the Iewes, for a small peece of monie, to the ende that he might sette a

                   vpon them, and burne them all vppe, where he might catche them, or come handsomely by them.
               It is most true, that the Iewes doe likewise call vs Worshippers of false gods, and idolaters, that is, Prayers to images, and doe herein agree with these Heretikes: but they are therein to bee 
                     •
                  orne withall. For they haue learned it of olde out of their Bible, and also out of their Prophetes, who knewe nothing at all yet, of the goodly and Hellishe (I forget my selfe, I should haue said holy) ordinances of the Popes of Rome: neither

did they vnderstande, that the images must bee prayed vnto and worshipped, euen as the thing, after which they are made and fashioned.
               For Saint Thomas de Aquino, that heauenly English Doctor, was not yet in place for to teache such thinges, neither had▪ they yet hearde any tidinges of our Saintes, nor of all the miracles which they doe, nor that the milde Empresse Irene had not yet scratcht out her sonnes eyes, to bring to passe (by the good assistaunce of the seconde councell of Nice) the woorshipping of images againe. And therefore the Prophetes knewe not yet the difference that is betwixt Latria,
                  Looke the .13. Chap. of the second part. 
                  Dusia, and Hyperdulia: and therefore did they condemne all such, as did pray to any images, for woorshippers of false goddes, without making any difference or exception betweene the Catholikes and the Heathen.
               And now, when the Iewes doe reade the same, they thinke that the Prophetes did speake as well of our deare mother the holie Church, as of their forefathers. And then that which the Prophet Ieremie saith:Iere. 7.17. 
                  That they did offer Cakes

to the Queene of Heauen, that doe they thinke to bee spoken of by suche as call our Ladie, The Queene of Heauen,
                  Queene of Heauen. and doe offer to her Cakes, Flawnes, Tartes, and all kinde of proper thinges, without care. But these heretikes doe knowe better▪ yea, their olde shooes doe knowe, that the Prophetes speake to the Iewes, and not to vs. For wee were yet vnborne, and therefore wee may not seeme to take it vppon vs: for he that is not ytchie hath no neede to scratche, and he that is not scabbed, hath no neede to clawe. And yet they pretende so, as though they knewe no other, and doe not forbeare to blare vs out for woorshippers of false goddes, and idolaters: therefore shall not they goe free wt the Iewes. And it is not to be thought, that they shoulde haue any secrete conference with the Iewes, as Maister Gentianus hath verie learnedly considered and noted, yet hath he dealt verie grossely in one point, where he doth so spitefully blame the Iewes, for their golden Calfe, saying,Golden Calfe. that our deare mother the holie Church of Rome hath neuer beene brought vnto so great a follie as that. Truely, if this had not proceeded from him euen of a pure and

simple Catholike zeale, it might almost be taken for a blasphemie and an heresie.
               For although it bee verie true, that the holie Churche hath no golden Calfe: yet hath shee not therefore forgotten to follow herein the trace and footesteppes of the Iewes, her good schoolemaisters. For in place of that that Aaron the high Priest once halowed the golden Calfe, our deare mother hath ordeined and set foorth, that the Pope of Rome (who vndoubtedly is established in Aarons place) shall yeerely hallow and blesse a certeine number of lambes of waxe, which he doeth call Agnus Dei,
                  
                     Agnus Dei.
                   that is to say, The lambe of God: or, The sonne of God, which hath taken away the sinnes of the worlde: and being slaine as a lambe for vs, hath released vs from the bondage of the diuell, euen as Aaron and the Iewes did name their Calfe: The God which had deliuered them out of the slauerie of the land of Aegypt.
               
               And now, although that a Calfe is better than a lambe, and golde of muche greater value than waxe: yet our holie father the Pope of Rome hath suche a

notable deuise of Alcamistrie, that he will for these lambes bring good fatte Oxen into his kitchin, and lumpes of golde which will not bee muche lesse woorthe than the golden Calfe of the Iewes: for the power of these lambes is so great, that it is vnspeakable. And that may be perceiued out of the Latine verses whiche Pope Vrban did once send with fiue such Agnus Dei, to the Emperour of Graecia,
                  In the booke called Ceremoniale Roman. Eccle.
                   for a great and solemne present, whiche verses are these that followe:

                     Balsamus, & munda
                     cera, cum Chrismatis vnda,
                     Conficiunt Agnum,
                     quod munus do tibi magnum:
                     Fonte velut natum,
                     per mystica sanctificatum:
                     Fulgura de sursum
                     depellit, & omne malignum.
                     Peccatum frangit,
                     vt Christi sanguis, & angit.

               That is to say:

                     Balme, virgin waxe, and holie water,
                     an Agnus Dei make:
                     A gift than which none can be greater,
                     I send for thee to take.
                     From founteine cleare the same hath issue,
                     in secrete sanctifide:
                     
                        
                           All these vertues are ascribed to the Agnus Dei, or lamb of God.
                        Aynst lightening it hath souereigne vertue,
                     and thunder crackes beside.
                     Each heinous sinne it weares and wasteth,
                     euen as Christes precious blood:
                     And women whiles their trauell lasteth,
                     it saues, it is so good.
                     It doeth bestowe great giftes and graces,
                     on such as well deserue:
                     And borne about in noysome places,
                     from perill doeth preserue.
                     The force of fire, whose heate destroyeth,
                     it breakes and bringeth downe:
                     And he or she that this enioyeth,
                     no water shall them drowne.
                  
               
               Now my maisters, how like you this sauce? Let vs now see, if the golden calfe of the Iewes had such might and power. No, that was farre from home. Neither do the Iewes ascribe anie such thing to

their calfe: but did euen simplie thinke▪ seeing Moses was away, that they wold haue some apparant thing before their eyes, which should put them in remembrance of their deliuerance by God: and therefore they did call it, The God which had deliuered them out of the land of Aegypt, as our mother the holie church doeth likewise cōmonlie say, by an old rotten blocke▪ 
                  Behold, there is your God, which was hanged vppon the crosse for you: or, There is our Ladie which hath done great miracles. So that their Calfe is not to be compared with our Agnus Dei. But nowe, seeing the Iewes do knowe nothing of all this, neither do vnderstande of what power this is: therefore may they iustlie thinke, that their golden Calfe and our Agnus Dei, are both children of one mother. So that Maister Gentianus had done much better (speaking vnder correction) that he had not so quicklie and spitefullie blamed them for that matter: least nowe they should say, that the potte doeth blame the kettell for being so blacke with smoke.
            
            
               
               The ii. Chapter. That the sacrament of the Altar must be prayed vnto, otherwise Christ were no God..
               
                  Looke also the 4.5. and 6 cap. of the 2. part.ANd nowe, proceeding to the conclusions which Maister Gentianus doeth adde herevnto, which (I assure you) are verie fine and spiteful wittie, & is a very learned piece, which the schoolemasters of Louen call Argumentum cornutum, that is to say, A cornet or horned Argument, because he doeth herewith thrust all the Huguenotes as farre backwards, as a lustie yong oxe would crushe Paules steeple in pieces with his hornes. Marke nowe, this is his argument: If the sacrament of the Altar were not prayed vnto, then were Christ no God: and now Christ without all dout is God: Ergo these Huguenots must needes be damnable Samosatenes, which denie the Godhead of Christ.
               
               That hitteth as iumpe as sixe fingers in a gloue: For the holie church hath once for all resolutelie concluded, That the breade of the sacramēt, is the verie body of Christ, as long and as broad as it did hang vppon the crosse. Then it must needes followe, that whosoeuer doth not beleeue that, doth therewith also not beleeue, that Christ is

God: or else must men needes say, that the Church of Rome hath erred, which were so daungerous a matter, as would make the brisles of a wilde Bore to stand on end. It is verie true, that Christ did not commaund vs to praye to it, but said simplie, Take, eate, &c. And neither Saint Paul▪ nor anie of the Apostles did euer knowe of anie praying to it. But what is that to the purpose? Seeing men are sufficientlie informed, that they had not yet that power to make goodlie pixes, or sacrament houses, to laie him in, and to carie him sometime about in procession vnder a Canopie of silke: The followers were then to many: they had not the leasure nor time: neither was the dearelie beloued and eldest daughter of our deare mother the holie church of Rome as yet borne, to wit,Peruse the 4. chap. of the 2. part. 
                  Transubstantiation. But as soone as that blessed babe was brought into the worlde, by the meane & faithfull helpe of that good middewife called, Theologia Sophistica, and was nourished vppe with the sweete milke of her deare mamme and nourse Concomitantiae, then came first in sight iointlie withall, The praying to the sacrament: and then they lodged their God in

the halfe moone, and shut him in a goodlie golden cofer or pixe, till the time that hee should goe abroad with the Giant in the procession to quicken his spirites a little, and then they will daunse before the Bride with a fife & a drumbe. And thus doth this wittie conclusion and argument of Master Gentianus proponing remaine so fast and firme, as a reede, which is shaken to and fro with all windes.
            
            
               The iii. Chapter. Of praying to images, and especiallie to the crosse, and of the great power and aduantage of the crosse.
               
                  Touching this turne also to the 1. chap. of the 4. part.NOwe, after the praying vnto shapen goddes, hee doeth begin againe with praying to images, and to the crosse, which is from the Oxe to the Asse: and surelie, he hath conceiued that verie wiselie, where he saith, That we may not pray to the crosse, as to a creature, or to a similitude or likenesse: For there was neuer anie man so frantike or madde, which would pray to anie thing in steade of God, as a bare and simple creature: yea, the Iewes thēselues (as we haue seene) when they did pray vnto their golden calfe, did it not in worship of the golden creature, as a creature: but

in remembrance of him which had broght them out of the lande of Egypt: as they well witnessed them selues, in naming it by the name of him, after whom they had made it. The like haue the Heathen alwayes done: and in consideration thereof, they did call their images, idols, or simulachra, that is to say, Likenesses or images, because they did (in making them) attribute vnto them the power of God. And therefore did the Egyptians pray vnto those creatures, wherein they perceiued best Gods goodnesse to bee declared towardes vs, as Oxen and Kine, the Sunne and the Moone, and other creatures, wherin they founde anie speciall helpe or comfort: as is to be seene by Iustinus, Athenagoras, Arnob. August. Lactan. Eusebius, Orosius, and other such like, which haue written against them: and verie notoriouslie out of Esaie, who speaking against the Iewes, said, That God by his eternall and vnspeakeable power did make heauen and earth. And then he doth demaūd of them: Like vnto whom then will you make God? Or wherwith will you make his image? Giuing them thereby plainly to vnderstand, that they did not praye to

their blockes and stockes onelie as simple creatures, but that they did (through such resemblances & likenesses) thinke to haue an image, and so a remembrance of God: euen as Maister Gentianus doeth here likewise alledge. And it was also thus concluded in the second Councell of Nice. For sure,Looke the 13. chap. of the 2. p
                        ••
                     t. a calfe may conceiue and see, that our deare mother the holie church hath this discretion, as well as the idolatrous Iewes and Heathen. It may well happen, that some simple people, and olde deuoute wiues do esteeme that blocke or stocke it selfe (where it standeth) for a verie God: especiallie, when he beginneth to laugh vpon them, or els to weepe bitter teares for great pitie. But what then? That is satisfied by their good intents and deuout meanings, which the holie church doth applie to the best. Yet notwithstanding, her owne ground and foundation is no other, but euen the same groūd of the Iewes and Heathen. Alwayes excepted and to bee considered,The Image of the crosse prayed vnto. that the image of the Crosse hath a speciall prerogatiue before all other images & likenesses: for it is like to the Sextons Cowe, and therefore may grase in the churchyard: and she is by our deare mother

prayed vnto with a three folde deuotion more than other.
               But now, that I do not forget the crosse of pardons, which is commonly set vp in the church, when anie bulles or letters of pardon are come down from Rome: which crosse hath euen such power (vnlesse men will make the Popes Legates ranke liers) as the offring vp of the body & bloud of Iesus Christ vpon the crosse for our sinnes. And yet we must besides al this, pray vnto and worship all small or ordinarie crosses with Latria, that is to say, with such worship, as doeth apperteine vnto God onelie: acording to the order & cōmon rule of their schoole here before rehearsed & spoken of. After this now, the verie wood of the crosse which came from Hierusalem,Iohn Tekel the Popes Legate, and after that Bishop of Mentz, did preach this at Franckfort, anno 1517. Latria. Read the writers of Sent. which haue altogether concluded this after this maner. and which Christ was crucified vpon, must bee by vs worshipped as a creature for it owne proper worthines, & praied vnto with Hyperdulia, that is, wt such worship, as is ascribeth vnto the virgin Marie▪ especiallie cō
                  sidering the great miracle that is thervpon to be seene: which is, that it is so waxen & increased, that the pieces thereof would lade a good Hulke. And lastly, in reuerence of the most holie crosse, we must worship al

other tokens & similitudes of the same▪ Wherein our louing mother doeth attribute great preheminence to the holy crosse in respect of that which shee doeth shewe towardes all the reliques and holy things. True it is, that (most deuoutlie) she doeth worshippe a heape of speares, wherwithal Christ his side was pearced, and twoo or three dosen of the verie same nailes, which our Sauiour was nailed with on the crosse: yea, shee hath also ordeined a holie day in 
                     ••
                  uerence of the same, and hath appointed a speciall Masse for it: namelie, In festo Lanceae & Clauorum Domini. And then greetes the same most friendlie with a Sonnet,The feast of the Speare & Nailes of Christes passion. wherein shee singeth thus:

                     vouchsafe to be so good, &c.
                  
Thereafter hath she yet foure or fiue of the right sponges, wherewithall Christ was refreshed with vineger,Sponges. which she deuoutlie doeth licke and kisse, and reserues for a singular relique. Moreouer, shee hath the verie naturall tayle of the Asse whereon he rode,The Asse taile. The Manger. and the same Manger wherein hee laie, whereof she makes great store. But what is all this to be compared by the reuerence which she doeth shewe to the holie Crosse? For admit shee doeth worship fiue or sixe Speares, and some Nailes, yet will she not worship all the speares, which are vsed in the warres, nor all the nailes which are made in the smithes forges, nor all the sponges which growe in the sea, nor yet al the tailes wherewith the asses are couered behind, nor all the mangers wherein horses haue their prouender, (like as she doth permit to worship all the crosses which can be made) for then you should counterfeite the Ape to nigh: yet may it seeme strange to some, whether all other reliques or holy things haue pist against the moone

because they cannot atteine to the like preferment. For all the roddes of right might challenge the same priuilege, in worship of the rod wherewith Christ was scourged, and al ropes in worship of that with which he was bound, & all haithornes in worship of the thornes wherewith he was crowned. But it behoues them to be content wt their portion, for they are sufficientlie prouided for: & if sobeit the holy church doth please to attribute more to the crosse, it proceedes of her meere liberalitie, and of the special loue which shee doeth beare to the same, which for the same cause shee reuerenceth more than the verie body of Christ, which did hang on the crosse, or than his bloud which he hath spilt on the crosse. For wee can not perceiue, that in reuerence of the bodie of Christ, all bodies, & much lesse, all similitudes or likenesses of the bodie are had in reuerence or worship: like as not onlie all crosses, but all figures & likenesses of the crosse are worshipped, reuerenced, kist, and lickt in reuerence of that onelie crosse whereon his bodie did hang. But it hath thus pleased our louing mother the holie church: and not without most great and waightie occasions: for without doubt, the likenes of the holie crosse is of

of such great power & singular vertue, that the deuill doeth take it for a bulbegger, and flies from it, as a dogge doeth from a piece of bacon. Like as euidentlie appeareth in the golden Legend of Saint Christopher: and in a number of other legendes, where almost for feare hee beraied his breech, so soone as a crosse was made. And it is also the cudgell wherewith he was once beaten, like as wee may plainlie see on all altars, & in processions, where our Sauiour is counterfeited knocking with a crosse vpon the gates of hell, at which all the deuils runne awaye as though they were possessed. Moreouer, it is the token with the which God hath created heauen & earth: and that is it which Esai would say (according to the expositiō of our holy mother the church) saying thus: Who hath holden the waters in his fist? Who hath measured heauen with his spanne, & hath comprehended all the worlde in their measures? Who hath wayed the mountaines & hilles in a balance? Which is to say, that God did (with three fingers) make a crosse, when hee created heauen and earth. Item, our holie mother the church saith besides, That

Moses did with the figure of the crosse change the bitternes of the waters in the wildernesse, and caused the water to flowe out of the stonie rocke. And although the scripture doth not make mention of anie crosse, but onelie of a rod wherwithall Moses did strike: yet our mother the holy church hath thus expounded the same, supposing that Moses did the like to the Bishops now, who with their staffe do make a crosse & so blesse the people. Shee hath also fained, that those which do sprinkle their thresholdes with the bloud of the Paschal lambe, & theron set the figure of a crosse, that the striking Angel by meanes of the crosse doeth passe by it, like as wee haue out of their sequences, (which they vpon the crosse dayes, named Inuentio S. crucis, signe) here aboue rehearsed. Besides that, the same which Ezechiel doeth mention of Tau,
                  Ezech. 9.4. Tau is an Hebrew word, signifying with vs a token. For that which Ezech. doeth call Tau, that doeth Iohn expounde for a seale, Apo. 7.3. that is to say, of the token or seale, which is set vpon the foreheads of the elect, therof hath she also made a crosse: albeit that the letter Tau doth resemble the figure of the crosse no more then an aple doth an oyster: for the one is written thus, ת & the other thus, ✚: notwithstanding she doth not take the matter so neere: wee

must (for clownes) sift meale through a lattice, and set them packing after the homeliest sort, then may they bake their bread as they list. This once is the issue, that all cursing and coniuring, all hallowing and blessing, al mysteries and cōsecrations must be made with crosses.
               The holy Masse is likewise ful of crosses from one end to another: sometimes with two at once to saue both bodie and soule, or to change both breade and wine: sometime with three together, in worshippe of the Father, Sonne, and holie Ghost: sometime with fiue at once, in reuerence of the fiue woundes of Christ Iesus. The blessed holie water is made with crosses, the waxe candles, the salt, the holy oyle, the palmes,

                     o Durandus and Innocent, for they do expounde these crosses also in like manner. the Agnus Dei, the holie ashes, and all the implementes pertaining to the Priestes, are created with crosses: yea the Priestes themselues without crosses cānot be made Priestes. In al processions the crosse must go before. Vpon all bables, toyes & sacrament boxes must stand a crosse, least the diuell should put in his nose: yea, vppon all wafers & trinkets, vpon churches & vppon steeples, & also vpon coine, & vpon Māmona iniquitatis, a crosse must simper.
               
                  To conclude, the crosse hath an oare in euerie boate, and hath a place in all the ceremonies perteining to the holie Church of Rome. There can not a Pageant bee plaied, but shee must haue a part: yea, a Nunne durst scarse let a fyste, but shee must blesse her selfe with a crosse. And the Priestes are neuer worse at ease, than when they haue neuer a crosse in their purse. Therfore, it is not without great & vrgent occasion, that our holie mother doth holde the crosse in such honour: in so much as she hath for her sake, ordeined and instituted three or foure holy or festiual dayes, as namelie, Inuentio crucis, Rogationum, Exaltatio crucis, and other such like.Looke the 16. chap. of the 2. She hath also a speciall Masse in honour of the holie crosse, which shee names, Missa de sancta cruce: and a seruice called, Officium de sancta cruce. And besides she hath more ordeined and charged,Looke the 16.

purses, might be preserued against the diuell. Wherevnto she hath franklie giuen a great heape of pardons to those which with great deuotion do the same. For shee doeth esteeme and beleeue, that the crosse hath no lesse force than the bloud of Iesus Christ the sonne of God. For behold, these are the wordes with the which shee causeth the crosse to be consecrated or hallowed.
               
                  Oramus te Domine sancte pater, &c. vt digneris benedicere hoc lignū crucis tuae, vt sit remedium salutare generi humano, sit soliditas fidei, bonorū operum profectus, & redemptio animarum: sit solamen & protectio, ac tutela contra saeua iacula inimicorum, &c. That is: We beseech thee, O Lord heauenlie father, that thou wilt so blesse this wood of the crosse, that it may be a healthfull help to mankind, a cōfirming or strengthening to faith, a furtherance to good works, and a redemption of soules: that it may be our comfort, our safegard & defender against the noysome dartes of the enimies, &c.
               
               What can we ascribe more to Christ Iesus the sonne of God for the helpe & consolation

of man, than our mother the holie church doeth ascribe here vnto the crosse? yea all that Christ hath euer done, & all the good which can be thought, that hath shee in like manner attributed to the figure of the crosse. For these be her wordes:

               Beholde, here may you see that Christ Iesus is depriued of his right, & the same is giuen to a wodden Crosse, so that it is not without iust cause, that the Catholike children of our holie mother the Churche doe name themselues seruantes and slaues of the Crosse, singing thus:

                     Serui crucis crucem laudent,
                     qui per crucem sibi gaudent,
                     Vitae dari munera,
                     dicant omnes, dicant singli:
                     Aue salus totius soecli,
                     arbor salutifera:
                  
               
               
                  That is to say:

                     The seruantes of the holie Crosse,
                     her praise to heauen let them tosse.
                     And they which in the Crosse reioyce,
                     and of the giftes of life haue choyce,
                     Let this of all, both old and young,
                     in solemne sort be said and soung,
                     O holie Crosse which canst preuaile,
                     O tree of life, All haile, All haile.
                  
               
               Therefore neither is it any maruell, that she doeth call vpon it so deuoutly, and prayeth that it may defend vs from all aduersitie, crying with a shrill voyce: Ecce lignum crucis, venite, adoremus, That is to say: Beholde, here is the wood of the crosse, come let vs worshippe it. And also, O crux spes vnica, auge pijs iustitiam, dona reis veniam, That is to say: O holie Crosse our onely hope, increase righteousnesse to the godly, and pardon the offences of the wicked. It is no wonder neither, that she doeth so friendly flatter and coll it euen like as the shee Ape doeth her young ones, with all manner of pleasure shee can deuise. For shee doeth speake vnto it, and doeth commend it as though it had great vnderstanding. For this is it which they say:
               
                  
                  Dulce lignum, dulces clauos, dulcia ferens pondera: quod solum fuisti dignum sustinere Regem coelorum & Dominum. That is to say:
               
                  O sweete wood, which diddest beare a sweete burthen, fastened vnto thee with sweete nailes, which wast reputed worthie, thou alone aboue all other, to beare the King of Heauen the Lorde Iesus.
               
               With other sonnets, sounding all vpon the same tune, which shee singeth deuoutly in Gang weeke. And to the end that none should maruell hereat, Maister Gentianus doeth here shew, that all this is founded vpon the Scripture, the which he doth confirme by these wordes of Paule, God forbid that I should reioyce,
                  Gala. 6.14. 
                  but in the Crosse of our Lord Iesus Christ: for by this Crosse doth not he vnderstand the satisfaction and saluation which it brought vnto vs by the Passion and death of our Sauiour Iesus Christ (for that vnderstanding is hereticall) but onely the figure and bare likenesse of the Crosse, like as our deere mother the holie Churche hath expounded it, ordeining and commaunding that these foresaide wordes of Paule, bee

song vpon the day called Inuentio sanctae Crucis, with open voyce ouer the figure & likenesse of the Crosse. And in deede it is to bee thought, that this is the iust meaning of Paule: for otherwise if he had taken it so, like as these Heretikes will interprete it, what else might ensue thereof, then all manner of anguish and sorrowe, persecution and trouble?Gala. 3.13. Deut. 21.23. Which is all together vnderstoode by the Crosse of Iesu Christ, which was a kind of shamefull and detestable death, as the gallowes is with vs. Verely Maister Gentianus nor the Prelates of the holie Church conceiue no great pride in such a manner of Crosse: but they gladly post it ouer to the Heretikes and Huguenotes, against whom commonly they crie, Crucifige, crucifige, Hang them vp, hang them vp. But the figure and holy token of the crosse formed of gold or siluer, is the onely hope, trust, and staie of the holie Churche of Rome, & of all her subiectes. For it bringeth her in good rentes, and maketh continually a warme kitchen and a plentifull table. Therefore must we (doubtlesse) vnderstand Paule so, to the end his text may agree with the foresaid sonnet of the holie Church.
               
                  But touching Maister Gentianus, in that he is here angrie, and rores against the Heretikes, saying: It is a diuelishe mockerie, that the Heretikes regard not to aske, whether we will fraie away fli
                        •
                     s, when wee make a signe of the Crosse with three fingers. Therein hath he not (in my iudgement) any great reason, so to disturbe himselfe. For seeing that with a token of the crosse we fraie away diuels: what maruell is it then with the same to driue away flies, which in comparison are nothing so wicked as diuels? Howbeit they doe oftentimes shamefully beshite the Sacrament boxe, yea the God himselfe, which dwelles therein, and oftentimes do disturbe the deuotion of Priestes in their Memento, and when they stande dreaming in their secretes. Verily that is not to be compared by the diuelles. But Zele and feruent affection hath caused our Gentianus thus to speake. And from the flies doth he retire againe to the images, for those in no sauce can he forget, but will defende them by vertue of the second councell of Nicen. But because wee haue hereof spoken sufficiently before, wee will not trouble the reader therewith any further.

of our neede. Yea she hath prescribed to eache his charge, like as vppon Twelfe Eeue, euerie one is appointed his office by drawing of lottes: Our Ladie hath gotten the beane out of the Cake, and the Queene of Heauen is their hope, their staie, the gate of heauen, the Queene and mother of mercies, Mother of compassion, their life, their pleasure, and their onely Mediatour & Aduocate.
               
               In summe, there is no other refuge or present staie, than she alone, like as they with expresse wordes doe dayly sing in their prayers and thankesgeuing in their Christi virgo dilectissima, their Aue Maria stella: O intemerata: Stabat mater, and many other pretie pageantes, whiche our holy fathers the Popes of Rome them selues haue made, and with manie pardons haue trimly adorned and set out: but in especiall in their Salue Regina. Yea, they beseeche her in one of her prayers, which they call Prosas, that she will, by her motherly authoritie, commaunde Christ Iesus the true and euerlasting God, and shewe by the date, that shee is the mother. Moreouer they beseeche her also that shee

will accept and receiue them in the last houre of death,Looke ye church songue beginning Aue praeclara maris stella. Also looke the Masse bookes and the seruice of our Ladie Marie, her Rosarium, Hortulus animae: the .7. tydes, and other Popish bookes, which are replenished with such pranckes. and to defende them from their foes in the prayer called Maria mater gratiae, &c. After that, all whatsoeuer is spoken in the worthie song of Solomon, named Cantica canticorum, of Christ the sonne of God & of his louing spouse, namely, the commonaltie of the faithfull: Also, all whatsoeuer Esaias hath prophesied of the sprigge, which should spring out of the roote of Iesse: & of the same which should crush the old crooked snake, that doe they all expound and declare of her: Yea also the selfe same first promise, which God made to our forefather Adam, saying: That the seede of the woman, should grinde in peeces the head of the Serpent, That hath our holy mother the Church of Rome aduisedly expounded of Marie. And therefore in place where there stoode, He shall grinde, hath shee set, Shee shall grinde, as being spoken, not of Christ Iesu the sonne of God, but of Marie herselfe, which should be the promised seede. In summe, all the worshippe which in the scripture is attributed to Christ Iesu the euerlasting sonne of God, the same hath she bequeathed vnto our Ladie. And therefore will shee (besides

so many holy dayes as are instituted and ordeined for worshipping of her, that we shall notwithstanding celebrate and keepe holie the Saturdayes for her, to the ende she may at least haue as much preferment as her sonne Iesus Christ to whō the Sundayes are attributed. Howbeit, for all that vppon the Sundayes, Officium beatae Mariae, that is, The seruice which is done for her worshippe must not be forgotten.

                     ie of Venice, that these Croutched-friers should be musseled, & forbidden to preache so any more, as beeing a

matter most hurtfull to all Saintes, and especially to our welbeloued mother of God, which by the Catholikes is worshipped, & who was verie wofull to be so forsaken, by meanes of following her sonne. So as it is not without occasion, that our welbeloued mother the holie Church, hath foresene this matter so discretely, ordeining that she should at least deserue as much deuotion and reuerence, as Christ Iesus himselfe.
               
               
                  For this their Ladie is desirous of glorie, and verie fonde of such deuotion:
                  This storie is set foorth in the Churche of Loreta, & affirmed in the historie of 
                        •
                     eander Albert of Bullin, called The description of Ital
                        •
                     , where he is writing of Recanati. 
                  which euidently appeareth by her closet, wherein she was borne and bred. For when the Iewes did first cleaue to the faith of Mahomet (gesse when this was) then did shee ordeine, that the Angels should remoue her closet from the foū
                     dation, standing in Nazareth, and beare it through the aire into the countrie of Slauonie: But when shee perceiued that she was not sufficiently honoured there, as she did looke for, then did shee most speedily cause the Angels to remoue the same closet to a hill in the countrie of Recanati, in a wood, which apperteined to a good womā named Loretta: wherby

she is yet called at this day, Our Ladie of Loretta, howbeit, she could not abide to staie there long, for that (by reason of the great accesse of people) many murders and robberies chanced: for which cause she remoued againe, & caused her closet to be borne vnto an other mounteine or hill, which apperteined vnto two brethren, which for the lucre or gaine which they receiued by her, fell at variance, & agreed like dogs and cattes together, so that she would afreshe remoue againe: and seemed in a manner to haue a flie in her taile, being vnable to remaine in one place. In sum, the Angels did remoue this closet again from thence, and did bring it vppon a common highway, where it doth yet remain to this houre, without any ground hold or foundations, by reason that the foundations were left at Nazareth. And now it is compast in and preserued with bulworkes & strong walles, which notwithstanding dare not touche the holie closet, through feare & reuerence which they beare to the same.
               
               
                  And for proofe that this is true, doth first appeare hereby, That our Ladie

did appeare to a deuoute man in a dreame,
                  This demonstration is also written in the Church of Loret, and is repea

                  and hath manifested all these thinges vnto him, and he hath declared all the same to the commons of Recanati, the which (therevpon) did forthwith send .xvi. chosen men to Hierusalem, to inquire for the certeintie hereof. To be briefe, they haue found the foundations yet standing there of the same closet, so that there remaines no more doubt to be had in this matter.
               
               
                  Secondly, a certeine holie Heremite (about two houres before day) did see a great light descending from heauen, (in likenesse to fire) which lighted vpon this Churche, and it was twelue foote high, and sixe foote broade: so that vndoubtedly it must needes be our Ladie, which came to take viewe of her feast, and solemnization: for this happened vpon the day of her birth, the eight day in September, in those dayes, when dumbe beastes spake, and houses did 
                        •
                     lie. And then did the cocke crowe, and it waxed day.
               
               Lastly, wee may easily discerne this same, by so many, yea many godly miracles which shee euen there hath shewed

vppon those whiche (in their neede) did call vnto her, out of so many faire pictures and costly monumentes, whiche were lefte there in her holie Churche, by sundrie Emperours, Kinges, Dukes, and all other sortes of people to an euerlasting memorie. This is no mocking matter: For the Pope of Rome was wo
                     •
                  nt yeerely to receiue hereby about a hundreth thousande Ducates, (howbeit, that now the rent is greatly abated.) And therefore is it, that he doeth cause it to be so diligently kepte, and so strongly inuironed with walles, appointing alwayes a Cardinall for safe keeping of it, and aboute foure or fiue dozen Cannons and Chaplines, which vsually obserue to doe her diuine seruice, and keepes her from Theeues▪ and Robbers, from Spiders, from flies, Mothes, and other her enimies. The whiche is so true, that who so dare but once doubte of it, the same is reputed and presented for an Heretike: like as is manifested by the example of Petri Pauli Vergerij, which for the same cause, was once in the handes and examination of the Inquisitours. Whereby wee may sufficiently gather,

that this Ladie is greatly desirous of glorie and honour, and coueteth to bee accepted and worshipped for the Queene of Heauen, and also to haue the preeminence before all the Saintes of Paradise: For shee is of an other disposition than the holy Virgin Marie (the mother of Iesus Christ) was,Luke. 1.48.
                   who did acknowledge her selfe to bee a poore handmaide of God, and did direct those which needed any thing vnto her sonne Iesus Christ. But this standes bedeckt and garnished with Golde and Siluer like a Queene,Iohn. 2.5.
                   and willes that we should reuerence and adore her clothes and iewels, her Churches and Chappels, her gilded cofers and other her furniture, vtensiles, and implementes, like vnto the euerlasting and liuing God. To conclude, the holie Church hath made her Queene.
               After this,Offices of Saintes. hath shee also mustred all other Saintes, and hath assigned and appointed to each his sundrie charge and seuerall office a pa
                     •
                  t. Each hath his holy day, his sundrie Collect, holy Hymnes and deuout praiers: euerie one doth know ouer what handicraft or science, ouer which disease, ouer what towne or Church he is appointed

to be patrone, defender, and Baal▪ 
                  The Dutche are vnder the defence of Saint George. The Burgonians holde Saint Andrewe for their Patrone. The Frenchmen Saint Michael. The Spaniardes Saint Iames. And further, Saint Peter and Saint Paule are troden in the place of Romulus and Remus, and defend the Citie of Rome with a key and a sworde. Saint Markes Lion is Patrone ouer the towne of Venice, Saint George on cockehorse ouer Genua, Saint Ambrose with his staffe and whippe in hand ouer Millain, the three Kings ouer Cullin, Saint Dionis keepes the towne of Paris, Saint Goele doeth keepe scoute watche at Brussels, Saint Baue and S. Louell doe loue the towne of Gaunt, Saint Romboute doth keepe the garrison at Machelin, Saint Lambert at Luike, and so foorth. After this hath Saint Hugh and Saint Eustace, gotten the hunters in gard, Saint Martin and Saint Vrban the Aleknightes, Tauernhunters, and dronkardes, Saint Crispin and Crispinian are Patrones of the Shooemakers, Saint Arnold is Baal ouer the Millers, Saint Steeuen

ouer the Weauers, S. Luke is alloted the Painters. And the Physicians (which might haue grudged and complained hereat) haue gotten Cosmus and Damian to their chosen. The Carpenters do vaunt of their Patrone S. Euloge. The Tailers (which loue good fellowship) do cleaue to S. Goodman. The potmakers haue elected S. Goare, who carrieth a blacke diuell vppon his shoulders, with gloing eyes, and a pot in his hand. The whores and light women were not content with one Patronesse, but haue Saint Aphra (which may bee set in Venus place) which in times past was also called Aphrodite: and besides her S. Magdalin, and so forth, as appeareth in Processions and statelie shewes in Brabant and els where, where each companie doth beare his Patrone or Baal in stremers displayed with great state. Moreouer and aboue this, S. Anthonie must keepe the hogges, S. Loy the horsses and kine, S. Hugh the dogges, least they run madde, S. Gallus gardes the geese, Saint Wendelin the sheepe, S. Gertrude reigneth ouer rats and mice.
               
               Yea, which is more, each disease hath

his sundrie Apothecarie and speciall Doctour. S. Iohn and S. Valentin do heale the falling sicknes, howbeit that S. Iohn with S. Benedict is also appointed ouer all infections of poyson. S. Anthonie can heale the burning, S. Roche the pestilence. Notwithstanding Saint Sebastian hath some skil in it also. S. Roman doth restore the possessed and madde people againe to their former health, S. Marke doeth preserue the people from souden death. S. Cosmus and Damian are good for all byles and swelling diseases. S. Iob for the pockes, S. Appolin for the touth ache. S. Clare doth cleare and heale the firie and red eyes. S. Agatha hath skill howe to deale with swelling breastes. S. Margaret is middewife for those which are in trauell with childe. But because that she remained alwayes a chaste virgine, and therefore not throughlie expert in her facultie, S. Norpurg was ioyned with her, as a trustie mate in such a matche. S. Petronella can driue away all manner of agues. S. Vincent and Saint Vinden cause all thinges that are lost to bee restored againe. Saint Seruatius doeth cause all thinges to bee

well kept. Saint Vitus doeth direct all daunsers, and such as will leape or vaute.
               
               Hereafter yet hath eche his chosen ioynt or speciall place in gouernement of a mans bodie, like as in times past the twelue signes of the Sunne. Saint Otillia doeth gouerne the head, in place of the first signe named Aries: howebeit shee hath bequeathed the tongue to Saint Katharine, and to Saint Appolin the teeth. Saint Blasius is appointed ouer the necke, like as the signe Taurus. Saint Laurence keepes the backe, together with the shoulders, in steede of Gemini, Cancer, and Leo. Saint Erasmus rules the whole bellie with the entrals, in place of Libra and Scorpius: Notwithstanding that Saint Appollinar hath also taken charge ouer Scorpius: for hee is president of the secret members. And forwards, in steede of Sagittarius, Capricornus Aquarius, and Pisces, hath the holie Church of Rome elected Saint Burgard, Saint Rochus, S. Quirinus, S. Iohn, and other more, which gouerne the thighes, the knees, the shinnes, and the feete.
               
               
                  To conclude, eche hath his seruice, and who so is the deuoutest in honouring these Saintes, with burning tapers, with rose garlands, with gaie coates, and with good fat liberall offrings, the same is the most acceptable and beloued of our mother the holie Church. It is verelie great prouision with small cost, that the poore people (what neede or disease so euer they haue) knowe presentlie where to finde a good Apothecarie or Cheirurgian to cure their diseases. For touching the Heretikes which vpbraide vs herevpon, that we imitate the vnbeleuing Heathen, and worshippers of idols (as hath bin said) & are none, like as Iupiter, Mars, Mercurie, Vulcan, Iuno, and Diana, and other such like haue bene: but are holie saints & Gods friends. And therefore ought we (at least) to shewe them as great reuerence, as the Heathen did to their idols. Wee ought in time of neede to call vpon them: to put our trust in them: obseruing their rules as a cōmandement of God: to bequeath Cities & Countries to their custodies: to erect Temples and Altars in their names: to builde Cloisters and Abbies for their sakes: to consecrate and hallowe Priestes, Monkes,

Cannons and Nonnes for their worship. And like as the Heathen had their Flamines, that is, Priestes of Iupiter, Mars, Ceres, Bacchus, Venus, and Diana: and also their Nonnes of Vesta, Flora, Bona Dea, Sibyl, or Magna mater, and other such like. Euen so must nowe the Church of Rome also haue Cannons of S. Peter, S. Bauen, and S. Lambert: And Nonnes of S. Clara, and S. Brigit. Also as they were accustomed to offer sacrifices in honour of Apollo, Diana, Ceres, and Proserpina: euen so shee obserueth to doe her Masses and Trentals, in honour of S. Anthonie, S. Hugh, S. Sebastian, S. Rochus, S. Barbara, and of all Saintes. To conclude, they did not anie worship or reuerence to their idols: but the holie church doeth ten times more to her Saintes: for shee doeth attribute such things as they durst not to do the like. For (as Homer maketh mention) when Iuno, Pallas, or Apollo, or anie other of that companie would assist anie of their friends,

                  they were faine to descende from heauen downe to them, & could not heare their praiers so far off, because they knewe not their thoughts, although they were mediatours and intercessors

for them to the great idol Iupiter. Yea, Iuno her selfe, which was his sister and spouse, knewe not what Thetis had held him in hand with. But our Saints remaining sitting in heauen, canne erewhilest helpe the people here on earth with their images, which can laugh and weepe, and doe all manner of miracles: and they heare from aboue euerie mans inuocation, as well as God him selfe. For, admit that the Scripture witnesseth,
                     1. Reg. 8.39.
                   
                  That none doeth see or can conceiue the thought or inward cogitation of man, except God alone: yet the holie Church hath found a trimme remedie for that, by a preatie deuise of The looking glasse of the Trinitie, saying, That the holie Trinitie is a looking glasse, wherin the Saints can see all things whatsoeuer happen here on earth: yea, can sound the depth of mens thoughts, and perceiue the secretes of their heartes. It is verie true▪ that we doe not call our Saints by this name God, like as the Heathen were wont to doe their canonized Saints: But what skilles it for the name, when wee vnderstande the matter aright?

Howebeit notwithstanding, wee name them Diuos: which is euen as much as Gods, or, Men created Gods: like as they also were wont to call their men canonized Goddes, as Hercules, Dionysius, Augustus, Vespasianus, &c. And here besides we doe attribute to them this name Saintes, or holie men, after the same sense, as GOD names him selfe the holie one of Israel, that is,Esai. 43.3.14 and in manie places. 
                  The Defender and Safegarde which doeth sanctifie Israel. So that our Saintes are (at least) so highlie honoured of vs, as in times past anie idols haue beene by the Heathen, and as God him selfe can bee by vs.
            
            
               The v. Chapter. Of the interpretation of the wordes Latria, Dulia, and Hyperdulia, and howe they are distributed to eche.
               FOr seeing it is requisite, aswel through the obiections which the Heretikes do here alledge, as also that God hath commaunded,
                  Psal. 50.15. 
                  that wee shall alone call to him in our neede, and that he esteemes it more than all sacrifices and burnt

offrings which we can make to him: yea, that it is hee alone which can helpe vs,
                  Esa. 63.6.43.11. Esa. 63.16. and 64.10. 
                  and that Abraham doth not knowe vs, nor Israel can say nothing of vs, but that God alone through his might can relieue vs, that is to smal effect: for that knot can our holie mother so netelie lose, that it is a maruell which the distinction that Maister Gentian doeth here bring foorth: and is by all Catholike Doctours, and especiallie by the worshipfull Sir Sonnio, reputed for a mightie bulworke, namelie, betwixt Latria, Dulia, and Hyperdulia. For the holie church hath hereby made a diuision or cauill betwixt GOD and the Saintes, wherewithall eche must bee content, as namelie:
               
                  That God alone with his images and the holie crosse, shalbe honoured with Latria: the Saintes & their images with Dulia: and our Ladie with all the images which apperteine to her, and all the reliques of the right and holie crosse in deede, with Hyperdulia.
               
               In verie deede, God hath the worst chaunce: for if so be we do expound it naturallie, and according to the literall sense of the word, then is Latria nothing else but

                  A hirelings payment. For Latron is a Greke word,
                     Latria, looke the 3. chap. of the 4 part. which betokeneth A reward or pay which is made to a hired seruant: and thereby are the hired men seruantes called Latres: and the maid seruantes Latris. And euen so is God serued of the holy Church of Rome onelie for reward, like a maister of a hired seruant. Againe this Dulia, which is the Saints lot and portion, signifieth A bound seruice:
                     Dulia.
                   for Dulos in Greeke is A slaue, and proper to anie. And touching our Ladie, to her is alloted the best chaunce: for Hyperdulia is to say,
                     Hyperdulia, lok
                        •
                      the 1. chap. of the 4. part. 
                  More than proper bounde seruice. So that the good Catholikes are but simplie hirelinges, or Gods hired seruantes and slaues to the Saintes, but bounde to our Ladie aboue all. But, be it, as be may, Quod scripsi, scripsi, said Pilate: The holy Church will not reuoke her cauils, the lot is east: that which is written, remaineth written. Yet notwithstanding, because God shall not be displeased, she hath ordeined, that the Saintes shal giue him a share of their Dulia: but hee shall keepe Latria wholie to him selfe: so that Latria shall simplie signifie nothing else, then the seruice which perteineth to God alone.
               
                  In this respect hath Maister Gentian and all other Catholike writers great reason, (as they alledge) that the holie Church doeth not worship the Saintes like God with Latria, but simplie as Saintes with Dulia and Hyperdulia: for that hath his plaine dispatche and ground on the cleare text of the Scripture, where Christ saieth to the Saintes,Mat. 4.10. 
                  Thou shalt worshippe the Lord thy God, and him onlie shalt thou serue. For in these last wordes doeth hee vse the worde Latreum, the which doth agree with Latria: and saith, that to God alone we shall attribute the same. But in the first wordes he doth not once mention, that we must worship God alone with Proskynesi, that is, With falling feete, or kneeling: Therefore will the holy church, that this shall also be attributed to the Saints, like as it is apparantly manifest by the 2. Councell of Nice, and by al Catholike writers. And although it is true, that Christ doeth declare these wordes by the witnes of Moses,Deut. 6.13.10.20. which doeth ascribe the first as well as the last to GOD alone: yet the holie Church is not to reason with Moses in this point: for so much as Moses

wrote that to the Iewes which were inclined to the seruing of idols, and not to the Church of Rome: which doe not woorshippe idols, but onelie Saintes.
               Item, there is an other plaine text in Paule, which saieth to the Galathians, That when they did not knowe GOD,
                  Galat. 4.
                        •
                     
                     ▪
                   
                  then did they serue them which were no Goddes: euen where he doeth vse this word Dulium, which is deriued of Dulia. Whereby it doth manifestlie & plainlie appeare, that these Heathen haue also knowen this Catholike distinction, and therefore woulde not worshippe their Saintes, as Apollo, Bacchus, Hercules, Castor and Pollux, with more other such like, with Latria, but baselie with Dulia: Euen like as nowe the holie Church of Rome doeth serue her Saintes. Touching all other Prophetes, which so often crye, that in time of neede, wee should onlie turne to GOD, and that hee will bee honoured by our calling to him: yea, and say, that all Patrones, Defendours,The Scripture is full of such. & Baals which may be thought on (to declare our grieues vnto them) are plaine idols, all that is to small purpose, for they did not (in those dayes) knowe anie

thing at al to say, touching this our distinction, and therefore haue they gone roundly to worke, vsing plaine speech, without fauouring the matter, or lapping it about wt softe ragges: but haue serued all such as inuocate idols, pray to Patrones, seeke vnto Saintes or anie deceased dead men, with one sawce, and without excepting anie, hath giuen them to drinke of one cuppe. But if the Iewes and other idolaters had bene so wise, to haue obiected to the Prophetes this worthie distinction in steade of a bucklar, I trowe they would as easily haue stopped their mouthes, as nowe ye newe gospellers and preachers are put to silence.
            
            
               The vi. Chapter. VVherein the worshipping of Saintes is affirmed by Scripture.
               NOtwithstanding our louing & deare mother the holie Church of Rome,Looke the 4. chap. of this part. can also fishe somewhat out of the Prophetes writinges, wherewith shee doeth approue the seruice of her holie Saintes: Prouided alwayes, that shee hath the keie to vnfolde the same for her most aduantage. For in the first booke of Moses

(called Genesis) is plainlie and expreslie set downe, That Iacob doth pray ouer Ephraim & Manasses, after this sort, saying:
                  Ge. 48.15.16. This witnes is brought forth by Eckius, 
                     
                        ••••
                     derius, and all other Catholike writers, treating vpon the same. 
                  God before whō my fathers Abraham & Isaac did walk: God, which had fed mee all my life long vnto this day, and the Angel, whiche hath deliuered mee from all euill, blesse the laddes, and let my name bee named in them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac. This hath the holie Church of Rome construed after this sorte, That Ephraim and Manasses must inuocate or call vppon the name of Abraham, Isaac, and Iacob: for so much as the olde Romishe exposition (which shee doeth accept as most firme and irreuocable) hath in place of, named, or called, set inuocated. And although the Heretikes doe vnderstande this after the most vsuall manner of speeche, (accustomed amongst the Hebrewes) that Iacobs name called vppon, or named by Ephraim and Manasses, is as much to saye, As that they should bee accounted of Iacobs generation, and accepted for children of Israel, like as Iacob him selfe doeth expounde it, saying: Ephraim and Manasses shalbe my children,

and shalbe called after the names of their brethren, in their inheritance. And, like as is saide in Esaie, the fourth chapter, That seuen women shall wishe by one mans name to be named,
                  
                     Psal. 4.1. 
                  or called vpon by them, which is, That they may be called the wiues of one man: Notwithstanding, for so much as this exposition is according to the plaine literall sence: therefore hath the holie Church of Rome abiected the same, and accepted the other former meaning: thereby concluding, that Abraham, Isaac and Iacob are to bee inuocated or called vpon: Howbeit, the Prophetes & Fathers in the old Testament haue neuer done the same, but haue protested the contrarie, saying, O Lorde,
                  Esai. 63.16. 
                  thou art our father: for Abraham knoweth vs not, neither is Israel acquainted with vs: but thou Lorde art our Father & Redeemer, and thy name is euerlasting. &. But that happened, because the foresaid Abraham, Isaac, and Iacob, were yet in the lodge of hell, and must pray for them selues, & could not then see in the looking glasse of the Trinitie, what was done here on earth. Wherefore likewise the Romish Church hath not set

downe their names in the Kalender, according to the custome of Rome. Besides, thei are to old, and were neuer canonized of anie Pope. Neuertheles, they serue our turne, to shewe after what order wee must deale with our Saintes.
               Moreouer, we haue yet an euident text in Ieremie, which is, Thē said the Lord vnto me:
                  Iere. 15.1. 
                  Though Moses & Samuel stood before me, yet haue I no heart to this people. Wherevnto doth agree the text of Ezechiel, saying thus: When the land sinneth against me,
                  Ezech. 14.14. 
                  and goeth forth in wickednes, I will stretch out my hand vpon it, and destroy all the prouision of their bread, and send dearth vppon them, to destroy man and beast in the lande. And though Noe, Daniel, & Iob, these three men were among them, yet shall they in their righteousnesse deliuer but their owne soules, saith the Lord. &c.
               
               Nowe, like as (by these wordes of Ezechiel) it is concluded, that Noe, Daniel, and Iob, were in the towne of Hierusalem, when GOD destroyed the same: so may wee also (in the like manner) conclude and affirme, that Moses and the Prophete Samuel did pray for

the children of Israel. And notwithstanding that the Lorde saieth, That he would not giue eare to their prayers, yet the holie Church doeth not regarde it, for so much as (like as it hath beene saide) they lye yet in the dungeon of hell, and could not praye so earnestlie nor with such zeale, as the Saintes doe which nowe are in heauen. Yet neuertheles, If they (being yet in the dungeon of hell) prayed so hartilie for the people:
                  These are the arguments of Eckius in his En. or Pamphlet in the chap. De venerat. Sanctor.
                   
                  What may wee suppose that the Saintes doe nowe, which stande in the Kalendar, and are Canonized by the Pope? Verelie, they praye so zealouslie, that (often times) their images here on earth, through anguishe doe sweate and weepe. The holie church do
                     •
                  h bring forth manie moe places of scripture for confirmation of these articles:Psal. 139.17. namely, that which Dauid saith: O God, I haue honored thy friends, which is, That we shuld call vpon Saints, which are Gods friends. Also that Iob saieth: Crie (I pray thee) if happilie there be anie that wil answere thee,
                  Iob. 5.1. 
                  & looke thou vppon the holy men, &c. And albeit hee speaketh there of the holie men which are in this worlde, like as the verie

text doeth plainely shewe it selfe, yet why may wee not vnderstand the same of our Saintes and holy men deceased? For so much as our mother the holy Church will so haue it to be vnderstoode.This argumēt is brought forth by Eckius, and other writers also. Ouer and aboue this, Christ will say at the last iudgement day, vnto those which haue beene helpefull to the poore and needie: Whatsoeuer you haue done to the least of these, the same haue you done vnto me. Ergo, Who soeuer doeth pray to the Saintes, and in place of God doth worshippe them, that doth God accept, as if it had beene done to himselfe. There are yet many more & sundrie of such like proofes of scripture, which woulde bee to tedious to rehearse: But because the Heretikes doe deride them, and will vnderstand them according to the literall sense, and after the Greeke and Hebrewe text: I knowe no better meane to dispute with them, then with a good fagot.
               Yet will I adde thus much more, That when they haue a sute to a King or mightie Prince, they knowe verie well,This is an argument of Eckius and all other Catholike writers. that first they must speake and sue for helpe of some of the Lords, who may broach their cause, and by their intreatie, be a meane for them

and so to further their sute, which considered, they ought not so rudely to encroche vpon the king of all kinges, without first to haue spoken with one of his court. In verie deede it is most true, that a poore woman at Louen sometime did thwart the Doctours and set them non plus: by saying. That if so bee it that the King or Prince himselfe had called & charged her, that shee should come to him, like as Christ expresly charged vs to come to him, saying:
                  Matth. 11.28. 
                  Come vnto me all ye that labour and are laden, & I will ease you: Then would she not haue gone to seeke any other for her Mediatour. But this womā was a great Heretike, and therefore was also burnt. Wherfore this article doth remaine in force & vnsoluble: to wit, that we must haue & allowe these Saintes for our Mediators, Aduocates & Atturnies, being else vnable of our selues to obteine fauour of Christ Iesus: yea though he should once againe die the death for vs, to prepare vs the way to haue free accesse to the mercifull throne of his heauenly father. For all this cā not serue, but we must haue a great sort of Solicitors, Patrones, Mediators & Baals which must moue the matter for vs

to whom we must vse all the worship and reuerence which we are able to shewe vnto God himselfe, sauing that they must bee content with Dulia, and must permit God to enioy Latria to himselfe, wherewith this matter is fixte. And so will we proceede to an other.
            
         
         
            Now followeth the declaration vpon the .5. part of Maister Gentian Heruet his letter, wherein is shewed, that the heretikes seek nothing but libertie of the flesh, hating all prayer, fasting and abstinence.
            
               The first Chapter. Which declares that it is a lawfull thing, to lie & falsely to accuse an heretike, being to a good intent. Also of the fables of Cocles of Laurence Surius and of Aloysius Lippomanus, and to what purpose they serue a
                     •
                   things most needefull and necessarie.
               
                  IN this fifth part doth M. Gentianus shewe,Wherefore wee may lie. that these Heretikes seeke nothing else but fleshely libertie, and to get loose the bridle of their owne wills and appetites: and therefore (saith he) is

it, that to the death they hate all prayers, fasting and abstinence. But here draweth great heauinesse towardes: For a man might euen at the first sight imagine, that he speaketh not indifferent, but of affectiō. Forsomuch as it is most manifest and well knowen,
                  Fasting and prayers of the Lutherians and Huguenotes. 
                  that they highly esteeme of prayer, and also fast verie often: refraining not onely from fleshe, but also from all kinde of meates, vntill the verie night, and remaine durable in prayer and in hearing of sermons.
               
               Hereby then a man might suppose, that Maister Gentianus hath deserued a whetstone, and wagged the thumbe, to make his case good. Wherefore wee will more deepely consider this point, and warily weigh the reasons which haue moued him herevnto. So that wee haue then here to consider vppon two pointes: Namely, the first is that which Dauid saith,Psal. 69.10. 
                  That the zeale of the house of the Lorde hath euen eaten him, Which is euen here affected in Gentianus. For he is so hottely inflamed with the zeale of the holie Romish Churche, that he is in a manner astonied and amased, so as he doeth not see what he saieth. In the meane while notwithstanding

doeth he recorde and call to minde that whiche our holy mother the Churche of Rome hath concluded in the councell of Constance, and the same time did put in practise, when the holie fathers there congregated did permit Iohn Hus and Hierom of Prage to be burnt, contrarie to the letters of safeconduite, whiche were graunted and giuen them by the Emperour and the saide councell, ordeining most firmely, that it should bee no offence to breake promise with Heretikes. Yet perhappes our Gentianus hath read in Cicero, That a mans faith or promise is stedfastnesse or vowed truth, of that which he pretendes to doe or speake. Therefore he feareth (as wee may iudge) that if he should say nothing but a truth, he might bee reputed and taken for a transgressour of the ordinances of the foresaide councell, as though he had vndertaken the faith of the Heretikes.
               Moreouer,Lies to a good intent. the holie Church hath consented and ordeined, that sometimes a lie may be inuented against Heretikes, for a good intent, as to fraie simple people from desire to reade their bookes, least thereby they should fall into their heresies. And

that this be true, appeares first by strong prouebable reasons: & further by credible examples. The reasons are these: That the holie Church hath ordeined & concluded (like as yet by the daily exercise appeares) that it is not ill done, to make the people beleeue many fables & Caū
                     terburie tales:
                  Fables. 
                  as of holie reliques, Saint Gabriels fethers, and Saint George his speare with whiche he did pearce the Dragon. Also of Saints as S. Christopher, S. Barbara, S. Katherin, of S. Francis vine and others suche like, whereof Gesta Romanorum, Vitas Patrum, Speculum historiale, the booke Lippomani, the booke Abdiae and Sophronij and the golden Legend, are full, and replenished with a number of suche fables, whiche our holie mother the holie Churche of Rome doeth tearme Piae fraudes,
                  
                     Pi
                           •
                         fraudes.
                   
                  that is to saie, holie deceiptes, or golden Legendes: And saieth that it is the milke, whiche Paule did giue the Corinthians to drinke when they were yet vnable to disiest strong meates: like as a good gray frier was woont to say at Ghaunte. In so much then, that it is allowable to faine suche fine fables, to

prouoke people to deuotion, muche more then is it tollerable to rehearse some odde and strange iestes of Heretikes, as to wit, that they are blacke and foule fauoured, and worke matters with the diuell, with such like thinges, to affright people from the studie of their doctrine. Now the examples are also verie sure & waightie. For vpon such like lies, which the holy supposses or subiects of the Romishe Churche, hath persuaded Emperours & Kings to beleue, were they permitted to make their placards & priuileges against the Lutherians & Huguenotes, wherby such controuersies & tumultes are growen & sprong vp in the world, that it is to be doubted, great bloudshed will be made before they will be apppeased againe. This may sufficiently appeare by the wordes of the Placard in the reigne of the Emperour Charles of noble memorie,Placardes of Charles the .5. set forth in the yeere .1521. at the citie of Wormes, declaring expresly, That Luther was a Pelagian, and did disdainefullie contemne the Saintes. Also he taught, that there ought to bee neither gouernment nor superioritie, nor yet obedience, & did gainesaie reproue and disalowe all good ciuil pollicie and

spirituall reformations, to the ende the commonaltie should be moued & prouoked to raise armes and rebell against their rulers as well Ecclesiasticall as Ciuill, and to frame themselues to contend, murther and steale, wasting and consuming all thinges with fire and sworde, to the great indammaging of the whole common wealth of Christendome▪ And, which is more detestable, he ordeined & allowed a certeine kinde of life, whereby each should doe that which he would in manner of brute beastes: and as a lawlesse man did abiect and detest all Ecclesiasticall & temporall lawes.
               
               Beholde, these be the verie wordes of the Emperours acte, and this is the verie first & originall welspring of all the bloudshed, which hath happened throughout all Christendome for the space of seuen and fortie yeeres, vntill this present time, the which all men may both see with their eyes, and in a manner feele with their fingers to be most grosse, blockishe, and palpable lies, which Petrusa Sotto (the Emperours good ghostly father) and other Catholike Priestes did blowe in at his

eares: not for that they did suppose it to be so, for they had not a haire on their heades but it knewe the contrarie. But fearing the reformation of the Gospell, did moue the Emperours Maiestie (which otherwise of himselfe was not by nature giuen to wrath or any desire of bloudshed) to a bloudie abolishing & wrathfull extirpation of all these Lutherans & Caluinistes, which were not (in any respect) for their tooth: forsomuch as they sought to reforme papistrie by the authoritie of the Gospell: Notwithstanding, vpon their wordes onely did the Emperour proceede in his purpose, & would not at any time giue eare to the Heretikes. Like as now the King of Spaine, of a good zeale (supposing to doe God high & acceptable seruice) doth also proceede to the vtter ruine & manifest destruction of his own inheritance & naturall countrie, & his most loyall, louing, & obedient subiects: knowing no other,Placardes of king Philip. but that all is true, which his ghostly fathers and other Spanish Priestes and foster fathers of the holie Inquisition do put in his head: yea vppon the same hath not spared his naturall and onely sonne, but hath deliuered him ouer into the handes of the hellishe

Inquisitours permitting them to throwe him into prison, where most miserably he ended his lamentable life. Verelie this was a slie and fine fetche, whiche our holie mother did wiselie weigh, that to a good intent men might make a lie. For otherwise, if they might haue manifested naught but a troth, then shoulde the Heretikes haue founde audience by Kinges and Princes: the plaie had been made, and all thinges woulde haue gone a wrie with Priestes and Poperie, Masses and suche tromperie of the Romishe Churche: yea, the whole Spiritualtie would not haue beene worthe a beane, like as wee may perceiue in all places where these Heretikes haue had hearing, and where they haue beene permitted to plead their cause openly.
               
                  But worship bee vnto our Ladie of the seuen Okes, and Saint Iob of Wesemall with all the glorious Saintes, which are at Antwerp on the high aulter. For there (in good time) did happen some foresight, by the cunning of vnfolding the booke of lies, and causing Kinges to beleeue that the Moone was made of greene cheese: And good reason: for who so faines

himselfe to be a sheepe, may happen to bee deuoured of the Woolfe, according to the vulgar saying.
               But yet haue ye another commoditie whiche groweth by this kinde of sacred dealing. For if Priestes and Monkes were bound alwayes to preache the truth, there woulde ensue a great disgrace vnto them, for that they woulde oftentimes in their pulpettes become as dumb as fishes, being vnable to bring foorth any thing, because they are all vnfortunate in declaring the trueth, and therefore shoulde misse the meane to vtter their excellent giftes of filed eloquence. But when they haue no more arrowes lefte in their quiuers, then doe they fall vppon the Heretikes, and haue store of matter to talke of, yea wonderfull things to declare against them: they rage, they rore, they thūder, they lighten, & make them so blacke & deformed like diuels in hell. Sometime they catch a Caluin by the throte, sometime Beza, sometime their quarell is against Marottes Psalmes: sometime with the Greeke and Hebrewe texte, whiche in no sauce they can abide: sometime they martyr the Catechisme so pitifully, as though they had it on a racke.
               
                  To be briefe, they regard neither doore nor post, but shoote their shaftes vp to the feathers in it. They prattle like Pies, and seeme in a manner as they had soulde all their potte herbes, and yet reserue of the best to themselues, that is truely a sport and pretie pastime: specially to the deuoute women, which are not greatly acquainted with the Bible, or Gods worde, but rather listen to the Popes lies, and to daunse after his pipe, or to heare some Gospell of a distaffe, and tale of a tubbe. In fine, a man would verily iudge, that such Catholike preachers had beene all their dayes Pedlers or pelting Apothecaries of Dutchlande, or that they had farmed the prattle courte wholly to themselues. Like as daily may bee perceiued at all their Sermons, and specially at the woorthie Sermon, which a goodly grayfrier doeth vsually make in Frenche at Antwerpe in S. Iacobs Churche. It seemeth he is one of those foresaid pelting Apothecaries whiche hath trudged these seuen and thirtie yeeres to all markets & faires, about the countrie, to sell his triacles and rattes bane.
               
                  It doeth also appeare by the preaching of the foresaid brother Cornelis the whipper,Seeke the first Chapter of the second part. who doeth with such a zeale roare against Heretikes, that he will haue them rooted out quite, and to bee burnte to ashes. Yea, he hath not long ago preached, That childe bearing women ought to haue their wombes rent and torne, to take out their babes, and burne them, before they shoulde bee borne or brought foorth into the worlde, which he doeth affirme with a plaine texte, which he hath read in the kitchen bible, or else hath learned of his Cooke: namely, that of Egges fride in a frying panne, come no ill chickens. I omitte the goodly Sermons of dronken Nicholas,Dronken Nicholas. the Bishoppe of Harlem, and many famous sermons more of sundrie worthie champions, which doe ring their larum belles with suche vehemencie against Heretikes, that when they are in their pulpites, their hearse and rustie throtes will scarse bee refreshed and cleared againe with foure or fiue pottles of wine.
               Yet can I not forget, nor let slippe out of memorie, that pretious Sermon of the reuerend Bishop of Vtrecht, which he

made when the Prouinciall councell was holden there, whiche is about three yeeres past. For in the same he declared and pronounced it out at large, of the Dutche Beare Luther, and that his mother was a whore, and had slepte by the Diuell, with many suche like Caunterburie tales and forged fables whiche he had rakte together out of Cochles or brother Laurence Surius who were godly Catholike pedlers.
               And verelie suche trustie speares as Laurence Surius and Cochleus haue well deserued a good peece of rosted beefe hotte from the spitte, considering that with their notable and excellent briefe histories, they haue furnished and well armed the Bishoppes, Monkes, and priestes, with suche stuffe as will serue their turnes to occupie their Pulpittes with all. So as their stories may well and aptly bee called Dormi secure, that is to say, Sleepe without care: So that the Monkes and Parishe Priestes neede not studie in their Bibles for to make a sermon, so long as they are prouided of suche bookes. For therein they finde made readie to their handes,

matter enoughe to prate vppon: yea if it were naught else but the pretie pageant whiche the foresaid Laurence Surius doth rehearse of Caluin.
                  This pretie tale is to be reade in the historie of Laurence Surius, which he hath called, Comentarius breuis rerum in 
                           •
                        rbe gestarum, and is printed at Cullen. To wit, That Caluin shoulde seeke to confirme his doctrine with miracles, and therefore shoulde persuade a man to suffer himselfe to bee borne in a coffin to Church: And when Caluin called to him, before the multitude) that if his doctrine were true, he should arise, the man being smothered in the cheste was founde starke deade: his wife beginning pitifully to lament, Caluin did (with faire speache and promises of recompence) perswade her to bee still: and presently gotte him into the Pulpitte, declaring to the people that it was long of their vnbeliefe that this miracle woulde not fadge. It is a common saying, that, To him which telles a lie or a fable, it behoues him to haue a good memorie. But this was out of this good Historiographers heade, for so muche as he did not call to minde, that they are not accustomed at Geneua, to bring deade▪ corses into the Churches▪
                  
and muche lesse in time of any Sermons: besides, he had forgotten, that Caluine did alwaies teach it to be an vngodly and a diuelishe acte, to goe about to confirme the doctrine of the Gospell a new with miracles, which hath alreadie in times past beene sufficiently confirmed with most notable and wonderfull miracles of God. But the good Catholike is to bee pardoned, for that (with eating too muche fishe) his braines are weakened, and his memorie thereby decayed. Yet he declares more, which sounde a great deale better.
               As touching the miracles of Luther: of the bloud which issued out of the Sacrament from the altar in the countrie of Brandenburge, whiche (it may bee) he hath learned of Aloysius Lippomano, who hath likewise written a great booke full of such iestes. And many more suche lies and toyes with a witnesse, which serue greatly for the vse of Priests and Monkes in time of their sermons & preachmentes. And chiefely these newe base Countrie Bishoppes, whiche (for the most part) haue spent their time in studie, betwixte

the butterie and the kitchen, and can saie but litle except they be prickt forwardes with some helpes: like as may appeare by the worthie sermon of the reuerend Bishop Franciscus Sonnius, (the father of all the newe Bishops) which he made at his first entrie to a citie called Hertoghenbosch, saying, That the citizens might reioyce, for so much as they had gotten him to be their Bishop,
                  The sermon of Sonnius. 
                  for that henceforwards (quoth hee) you shall haue great resort of manie strangers, which (afore times) were wont to haue their trade to Luyke and Vtrecht, and the one should eate a herring, the other should drinke a potte of beare, which would be a great helpe to their impost, &c. Was not this a good helpe to sing Gaudeamus?
               
               In like manner also Curtius at Bridges, which notwithstanding had bene Pastour or Curate of the great and chiefe church at Louen, expounding that parte of the Gospell: Ego sum, nolite timere: I am hee, be not afraid, said, That he was the man,
                  The sermon of Curtius. 
                  of whom so much had bene spoken, and that they should not stande in feare of ought, considering he was a towns man borne, and christened in the same font.
                  
In fine, it was: which way to London? A pooke full of plummes. The good Curate had but litle to say, for hee knewe no tales of Robin Hoode, nor yet of Caluin, nor the Dutch Beare his miracles. Hee had not red ouer the pleasaunt histories of Laurence Surius, Cochles, nor Lippomanus. Therefore are they highlie to bee commended, which can furnish out their matter with such pleasaunt rehearsals, to keepe the audientes waking: as for the Byble or Gospell, they haue not forgotten much, because they feare to read it, least (thereby) they should become Heretikes. To conclude, so farre foorth as lies and fables doe serue to the aduancement of the holie Church of Rome, they are not onelie to bee borne withall, but also greatlie extolled. And therefore it is no maruell, that Maister Gentianus durst thus boldlie affirme by writing, That the Huguenotes and Lutherans did hate and detest all prayers, fasting and abstinence. This is than the first point, which is to be cōsidered hereof, for his discharge, to wit, That he hath (in this behalfe) behaued him selfe as a good and faithful Catholike.
            
            
               
               The ii. Chapter. VVherein is declared, Howe it is to be vnderstood, that the Huguenotes & the Lutherans do hate all prayers, fasting, abstinence, and penaunce or mortification: and herein is comprehended of the abstinence and mortification of Monkes, Bishops, Prelates, and other: and of the mortification which is vsed amongst the Huguenotes & Lutherans.
               THe other part is,The manner of fasting & prayers amongst the Huguenotes and Lutherans. that hee hath great reason to say, the Heretikes are mortall foes to prayer, fasting & mortification. For there is a rule in lawe, That, to plead a case ill, and otherwise then it ought to be, or to neglect the same wholie, doeth fall out to one effect. Well then, albeit the Heretikes doe often pray & fast, for so much as they doe it not as they ought, it serues them to no purpose. It is true, they pray morning & euening: & would be loth to go to their meales or to arise without praying and seruing God: which notwithstanding is oftentimes neglected by the most chiefest of the catholikes: like as may be seene in the Popes sacred Court, and at the tables of the Cardinals and Bishops: yea, amongst the most faithfull subiectes of the Romish church.Pardons to drinke after grace is said. In so much as it hath bin founde necessarie for a Pope to graunt pardons to such after their meales

should once drinke, to the ende that (thereby) he shoulde remember the good ale knights to say their graces, for to haue one good draught more when they haue done. I admit then that the Heretiks do pray apase:Iam. 1.5.6.7. Mat. 7.7. Mar. 11.24. Mat. 14.31. Mar. 9.23. Iohn 16.23. Psal. 27.1.2.3 Rom. 8.1.16. Rom. 4.20.8.33.34.34. &c. Galat. 4.6. Ephe. 1.13. 1. Cor. 13.5. Augu. vpon the 1. epist. to Timot. in the 8. sermon, and vpon the Galat. in the 5. Antoni. parte 4. Tit. 6. cap. 2. ff 7. Stanislaus Hosius in the booke of Heresies. And in the Councell of Trent, it is thus concluded. 9.12.13. & cap. 13.14, &c. Sess. 6. But to what ende is it? They pray not as they ought to doe. For, in primis, they will approue, that whensoeuer we desire ought in the name of Christ Iesus, that wee are assured to obteine the same. And therefore (say they) All faithful people are assuredlie persuaded of their saluation, and stand in no doubt at all of Gods gratious good will and fatherlie loue towards them: for so much as God can not lie, who hath (for Iesus Christes sake) vndoubtedlie promised them the same: and with his holie Ghost hath sealed and affirmed it in their heartes. This doeth the holie Church of Rome hold for great heresie, teaching to the contrarie, That none in this present worlde can certainlie know, whether his prayer be heard, much lesse, whether he bee in Gods fauour or no, except by great preeminence, or some speciall miracle, it be reuealed and made knowen vnto him. Therefore doeth she hold it for great arrogancie

and presumption, to say (according to Saint Paul) That the holie Spirit of God is in vs, and prayeth in vs,
                  Rom. 8.27. 
                  and that without it, we can not pray at all: For so much as none doeth knowe whether hee hath the spirit of God or not: and therefore must alwayes stand in doubt betwixt hope and feare, like to a ship without helm and compasse, betwixt the gulffes and waues of the sea, like as S. Iames doeth say.Iames 1.6.
               
               Secondarilie, the Heretikes will not declare and complaine their neede, but to God onelie, nor call vpon anie but him alone, as though none but hee could helpe them, or that he were at leasure, and had nought else to doe, but iust to heare what they would say vnto him. To the contrarie of this, doeth the holie Church commaund,In the 4. chap. of the 4. part. 
                  That wee shall likewise call vpon Saintes, and put our trust in them, like as hath bene declared before. Moreouer, they will not haue anie Mediatour or Aduocate to God, but onelie Christ Iesus. And so set all Saintes aside, as seruing for sifers, and standing to none effect: euen as though Christ alone were a sufficient Mediatour, and that the sillie Saintes had not one voyce in a court.
               
                  After this, they will not pray anie thing, for (forsouth) it must first be found prescribed in the Scripture, forasmuch as To pray without faith (say they) is sinne:
                  Rom. 14.23. Heb. 11.6. Rom. 10.17. 
                  And faith can not be allowed, without the promes and word of God. Hereby (la)doeth it come to passe, that the poore soules do remaine still frying in Purgatorie, for default of a Pater Noster, & an Aue Marie. In so much as now the high waye (through which the soules were wont to passe) is become such a thicket, ouer growen with thornes and thistles, that it is not possible to passe that way anie more.
               Moreouer, they will not pray otherwise than in their own mother tongue, or in such a language as them selues do vnderstand, as though our God did not vnderstand Latin: or at least, that they them selues ought to vnderstand that which they say. They build vpon Paule,1. Cor. 14. throughout the whole chapter. who forbiddeth to pray in an vnknowen tongue. But they doe not consider that the holie Church of Rome hath altered the case, commaunding, that Masses, Eeuensongs and Vigilles, Mattens, and Meridians, with all other such tromperies, should bee red in the Latin

tongue, euen like an vnlearned theefe readeth his necke verse:Latin tongue. for that is more meritorious, than if wee our selues vnderstoode what wee did say. Like as Cardinall Hosius, and Doctor dolt Eckius haue finelie affirmed out of that part of Scripture, where it is written, That Pilate did set downe the title or superscription, in Hebrewe, Greeke, and Latin. And in deede, it is good reason, that they which (after the example of Pilate) do crucifie Christ, ought likewise to vse and imitate his language.
               Further, these Heretikes will not say their Aue Maries, nor Pater Nosters, with litle pretie woodden bullets or beaderowes made of stone or yuorie, as though they should score them vpon a poast: they suppose perhappes, that GOD maye nomber or tell them him selfe, thinking he hath nothing else to doe. They will neuer kneele vnto Images or dumbe Saintes, (by prayer) to craue their helpe or ayde, but imagine GOD to bee present euerie where,Mat. 6.6. and that their prayers bee as forcible in their bedde chambers, as to our blessed Ladie, the Ladie of Hayle, or to

                  Saint Iames of Compostella in Spaine· And therefore do deride all the pilgrimages of our louing mother the holie church. And when they desire to receiue Gods holie spirit, they knowe not that they ought to say an Aue Marie, like as the good Catholikes vse to do at their sermons, for so much as Aue Marie is as much to say with them, as, O Lord graunt vs thy holie spirit. And, which is worst of all, they will not pray, neither through the merites of Saintes, nor through the vertue of holie water, of the holie oyle, of sanctified bread, of Palmes, Agnus Dei, holie Reliques, nor through the merites of holie dayes which they haue obserued, neither through the merites of their fasting, or anie worldlie thing else, but onelie through the merites of the onelie sacrifice or oblation of Iesus Christ, being offered vpon the crosse to God the Father: yea, they make a iest of all such matters, & condemne them for meere superstition and idolatrie. To conclude, they will not pray as the holie Romish Church doeth. Ergo, they pray not as they ought to do: and therefore must we account of them as though they did not pray at all.
               
                  Euen in like sorte doeth it fall out with their fasting: for they fast after their owne orders, and will not obserue the ordinance of the holy Romish Churche. But like as they pray without keeping any set taylie, or Ceremonie, so due they fast without a score, and without exception of dayes:Fasting without a score. so that God cannot well remember, when they haue fasted or prayed. And further when they fast, they wil not eate any thing at all, and make it as great a matter to eate fishe, as fleshe, and Egges: which is a great heresie, like as is shewed before. Where againe (notwithstanding) they will (with an obstinate he
                     •
                  d) defend, That,
                  Mat. 15.11. Titus 1.15. 1. Tim. 4.3. 
                  that which goeth into the mouth, defileth not the man: And, To them which are cleane, all thinges are cleane, whiche God hath created, to vse them with thankesgeuing. After this, they will not fast in reuerence of the Saintes, to obserue their Vigilles with deuotion, like vnto our holy mother: And when they haue brought all about, to what ende (I pray you) serues their fasting? They acknowledge themselues, that of it selfe, it is neither good nor bad: And,Rom. 14.17. 1. Cor. 8.8. 
                  That the kingdome of God doeth not consist neither in meate nor

drinke. Yea, they vphold, That meate or drinke doeth not make vs acceptable to God: And, That wee are not the better for eating, nor the worse for not eating. And that all their fasting onely serueth to make them more apt & fitte to serue God, and to submitte themselues to his omnipotent power: chiefly whensoeuer his wrath is kindled against them.To what ende fasting is vsed. Then doe they vse fasting, not for the deede it selfe, but for the occasion of prayer, & to humble themselues, but further benefit do they not seeke by it, vnlesse that anie of his own accord or free wil, do accustome him selfe therevnto, thereby to subdue his flesh, and the sinfull affections of his minde.A true kinde of fasting. 
                  Else (say they) the right fasting is, to refraine from all vngodlie and sinfull deedes, and to frame him selfe to vse a perpetuall sobrietie & temperancie all the dayes of his life.
                  Esai. 58.6. Luke 21.34. Rom. 13.13. Whereas notwithstanding our deare mother expreslie doeth teach, That fasting is a meritorious worke of it selfe, whereby a man may merit heauen, the fauour of God, and life euerlasting, as hath bene declared before.
               Seeing then that the Heretikes make

no account hereof, but rather esteeme it for vile, and an open blasphemie towards GOD, so doeth it appeare, that they do hate and abhorre the right fasting of the holie Church.
               Concerning Penaunce, mortification,Abstinence. and brideling of the flesh, therein they doe not likewise conceiue anie great pride: for otherwise they would goe to shrift, whereas nowe they mocke with it, and with all the penaunces which the ghostlie father doeth but then the penitent soules: withall. Further, they will haue Priests to marrie wiues▪ 
                  That eche one shall haue his married wife,
                  1. Cor. 7.2. 
                  and euerie woman her espoused husband, to the ende, aduoutrie & fornication may bee auoided. And will not lende out their wiues to the parishe Priestes nor Monkes, like as the good Catholike felowes (especiallie in Spaine) doe, for to pleasure the holie Clementish communitie, as is before rehearsed. They passe not for anie Ember weekes: They obserue neither Lent, nor Shrouetide, Saint Martins, nor Twelfth daye at night: they will not daunse, neither will they drinke anie more, than to satisfie their thirst: once they wil be right Huguenots
                  ▪
                  
they do not imitate their forefathers: they will haue a newe lawe after their manner: they esteeme it not worth a rotten medler, to remooue into a Cloister or religious house, and to begge from doore to doore: they skoffe with the holie Monkes coate: they do not greatlie glorie to be buried in a Monkes greasie hoode: they count the rope wherewith the Friers are girt, of no worth: but (say rather) It would fitte better about his throte, than about his loynes: they would not giue a beane, for the hearn garment of Heremites: they will not be chastised, and receiue the Miserere, till vnto vitulos: they will not whip them selues, like as the Spaniardes doe at Bruxelles, and the cōpanie of those which are called Flagellantes: they make no account of pilgrimages, and will not goe barefoot and bare head in processions, after the holie sacrament of Miracles, with a torche in their hand: they esteeme all the festiuall and loytering dayes neuer a whit: and when the good Catholikes doe sit in Tauernes drinking and swilling, deuoutlie obseruing the festiuall dayes, then sit these in their shoppes at worke, or else go to heare some sermon, or walke abroad:

in so much, that at Antwerpe (when publique preaching of the Gospell was permitted) it hath bene firmelie found by the impost and taxes of drinke, that these holie dayes haue bene neglected: where through the Almoners found them selues likewise much greeued, because they did not receiue such summes of money, as they were wont to doe by brokes of those which in their drunkenesse were wont to wound and slaie eche other: for so much as the Heretikes did not celebrate these festiuall dayes after the olde order of the Romish Church. In summe, they will not doe any thing at all to mortifie their fleshe, otherwise than the Apostles haue charged them to do, or then they did them selues, as though in deede they were Apostles them selues. So that we may plainlie perceiue, they doe not regard at al the fasting, abstinēce, mortification, or penance of the holie Church worth an oatten cake.
               And therefore can they not in like case merit heauen, I omitte that they should make others partakers of their merites, like as our Catholike Monkes & Priests, and especiallie the greie Friers do:The penance of greie Friers. which are so leane, as though they had lien diseased

seuen yeares in a coale house, and doe such penaunce, that wee may perceiue by their bleared eyes, they haue not droncke so much wine, as they desired to haue done: They lay their heads at one side on their shoulders:
                  Esai. 58.5. 
                  They wreith their neckes like a rush, they haue alwayes their Dirige booke in their hands:Esai. 59.5. 
                  They punishe their owne flesh: they wrinkle their foreheads like a Bucke: they make their eyes as dim as an Owle: they watche by night, to sleepe in the day: they forsake their owne riches and substance, to liue on the sweate of other mens browes: they labour neuer a whit, to the ende they may enter into more deepe contemplations: they vowe chastitie, and will not haue wiues them selues, to the ende and purpose, they may the more bouldlier shriue, and the better comfort other mennes wiues and daughters: they vowe obedience vnto their chiefe ruler, for to bee released and wholie freed from all obedience towardes other Magistrates and rulers: they take vpon them pouertie, to enriche their Monkerie: they wander like pilgrimes, to fill their baight bagges with lumpes of bread and roast meat: they visit the sicke, to cause them to

put on S. Francis cope, and go to tend those which are redie to leaue this life, to helpe thē make their willes: they weare a hearie garment and a graie coate, to shewe that they are like to wilde beastes and wolues in doing their penance: they weare a fooles hood, to declare that the world is replenished with idiotes: to be short, we may perceiue by their noses, that they loue mortification, as a dogge doeth a cudgell.
               But what shal I say concerning the holy Prelates and Bishops,Penance of the Bishops. who in al their clothing & vttermost habits do shewe their inward penance & mortification? Doe they not weare a Miter on their head with two hornes, to signifie that they doe knowe (by heart) both the testaments a like? and are alwayes prest to butte with their hornes against al heretiques? As also to shewe that they haue bin crowned wt thornes, aswel as our Lord was? And sometime they weare them snow white, to declare their vndefiled purenesse. Doe they not weare a paire of gloues, that their left hande knoweth not what the right hand doth? And, their gold ring, what doth it els signifie,Golde ring. but that they be vpright & without dissimulation? Their staffe, that they are strōg against heretiks?

And their handkercher (which is alwaies at hand) that they bee euer readie to abandon all earthlie filthines, and wholie doe rubbe of their fleshlie affections? After this, all Priestes in generall, haue they not a shauen crowne on their heades, to shewe, that like as a round crowne hath no corners, so haue they not anie filthines, which they can spare, or be without. But if I should rehearse all these matters peece by peece, it would verilie seeme to be a Babylon, which is, A fowle confusion, or meruellous medlie. Therefore, it is suffient to gather hereby, what great mortification doeth lurke and lie hidden in the skinnes of these holie subiectes of the Romish Church, which by their outward apparell and seeming, doe shewe such exceeding great holinesse. I referre now al men to consider what is to be thought of their inward parts, which are so holie, as though they were possest with seuen spirites. To the contrarie whereof, these newe Preachers, haue neither sticke nor staffe, myter nor ring, neither yet anie shauen crownes or other, whereby they may declare their mortification: yea, they goe arraied like other plaine people, and say, that Penance

and mortification doeth not consist in such and such like outward ceremonies,
                  Ioel. 2.13. Iere. 4.1.2.4. 
                  but in the conuersion of the mind and soule to Godwardes, and in an inwarde feeling of miseries, a true feling of Gods wrath against sinne, and in a firme faith and trustie staie vppon Gods goodnes and mercie through the merites of Iesus Christ. Moreouer,1. Tim. 6.8. 
                  That bodilie excercise is litle vailable, but Godlinesse in all thinges is profitable and helpefull. Wherein they sufficientlie shewe, that they knowe litle concerning the mortification which the holie Church doeth teache, and they contemne holie Confession, Contrition, Absolution, and Satisfaction, and other such like thinges, and loue the first day of Lent aswell as the last. Behold, for this cause is it, that Maister Gentianus hath so cunninglie concluded in this Article, That they hate & wholie condemne fasting, praying, abstinence, and mortification of the flesh.
               
            
            
               The iii. Chapter. VVhich doeth shewe, howe it is to be vnderstood, that we can not make satisfaction for the least offence: and hree is concluded, that the penaunce of Heretikes is not acceptable with God.
               
                  BVt forsomuch as they do here acknowledge, that we can neuer make satisfaction for the least offence of the worlde, that might seeme to be a great heresie: for if it were so, the Heretikes shoulde haue great reason to saye, that our satisfaction were vaine and friuolous. And therefore they would say,In the 7. chap. of the 2. part. as hath bin shewed before, That we ought to laie aside and treade vnder foote all hope of satisfaction, and wholy to cleaue & trust to the meere goodnes & vndeserued mercie of God,
                  Rom. 3.21.24 25.4.6.16.5. Galat. 2.16 3.13. Ephe. 2.8.9. 2. Tim. 1.9. 1. Pet. 1.19. Esai. 53.5. 
                  which in respect of our partes, is without desert bestowed vpō vs, but in respect of Gods righteousnes, is giuen vs for an exceding deere price, to witte, the bloud of Christ Iesus the vnspotted lambe, which (as Esaie saith) hath borne our infirmities, & was laden with our punishments: which was wounded for our sins, and for our sakes did suffer death: and vpon him is laid the punishment whereby we are at peace. And hereout they conclude with Paul, That we haue (through Christ) all satisfaction,
                  Colos. 2.3.4.5 1. Cor. 1.30. 
                  and that hee is wholie our saluation, iustification, and deliuerance
                  ▪ And with Peter,Act. 4.12. 
                  That by none other in the world, saluation is to be gotten, for

somuch as there is not anie other name giuen to mankinde, whereby they may be saued: insomuch that all our boasts,
                  Rom. 3.27. 1. Cor. 1.29. 
                  whether it be of good workes, merites, or satisfaction, is wholie excluded and brought to nothing: in so much as before God it doth not preuaile, and that no fleshe can be iustified in his presence by the workes of the lawe,
                  Psal. 143.2. Iob. 9.3 Rom. in the 3. and 4 chap. and Gal. in the 2. throughout. Esaie 64.6. 
                  and that all our righteousnes is naught els but a stained cloth. But al this is heresie, as it hath ben sufficientlie shewed before, and they which learne such, are hanged and burned like Heretikes.In the 2. part in the chap. of Satisfaction. For els (as hath bin said) what should become of satisfaction, and meritorious deedes, which (according to the doctrine of the holy Church) do amend faultes escaped,These are the proper wordes of Anthonius vpon the Sent. par. 3. in tit. 14 cap. 20. and by good foresight defend and set vs free from those to come? What should become of al our good works whereby wee can deserue three sundrie things, namelie, Eternall life, Increase & augmentation of mercie,These are the wordes of Barnardine Roset sermone 20. and Forgiuenes of sinnes? What should become of the merites of Saintes, through the which the holie church doeth pray vnto God, that he wil pardon all their offences, through the Saintes, whose reliques & bones do lie on

the altar where the Masse is said?This is in a prayer which the Priests say in their Masse presentlie after Consiteor, and herewith doeth agree Pet. Lom. in the 4. booke of Sent. dis. 45 Alto Bonauen. in the 2. article, and al other catholiks writers In so much, as (often) shee doeth pray through the merites of ashes, horses and dogges, whose bones for the most parte remaines also (as reliques) on their altars. What (moreouer) should become of our exceeding good workes, which are called Opera supererogationis, wherewith wee doe not onelie make satisfaction for our selues, but also for others, and especiallie for the soules in Purgatorie? Yea, what shoulde become of Purgatorie it selfe, if there were not satisfaction? What would become of Pardons and Bulles, which are allowed and sent from the Pope? Verelie they would serue for no purpose better, than to be brought to the house of office, to be sealed with portingale waxe, if so bee it were true, which Maister Gentianus doth here set downe, as that wee are vnable to make recompence for the least offence. It were in deede a lamentable case: therefore we must vnderstande him here aright. For his meaning was to speake thus obscurelie, because he would tole and entise the heretikes into the field. For otherwise, this is not his meaning: but doeth simplie vnderstand, that we can not satisfie, Nisi concurrente

gratia, that is to say, Except mercie doeth assist, and helpe our merites (as is said before) sometimes thorough the pikes. For we haue apparantlie concluded, that wee must make a bargain betwixt God and vs. He doeth giue vs his mercie in our baptisme: but after that, wee must shift for our selues, and by our good deedes bind God vnto vs, so that of duetie he must receiue vs into heauen: especiallie if we be assisted wt the meanes and by helpes of holie church: namelie, by the vertue of the Masse, holie water, tapers, &c. and with the Popes Bulles: for thereby will our infirmities amende, like corne shaken with a shower of haile, or like fish left on the sandes, and as sower Ale in Sommer. And if so be that (besides this) we will submit our selues, and take vnto vs the habit of a Monke or Frier, and so frame our selues after the ful shapen order of S. Francis, & S. Dominicks rule,Of supererogatorie works, read Peter de Asolo in the booke called, Asser. Cath

is Maister Gentianus to bee vnderstoode after this manner: Forsomuch as he doeth verie Doctorlike conclude, saying, Wee may not repose or trust hereto to much, to witte,
                  All Paules Epistles are full of these doctrines, & the pla

                      are noted before. 
                  that Christ shoulde haue made full satisfaction for vs: For albeit that S. Paule (euerie where) doeth teache otherwise, and (in anie case) will haue, that we shall repose all our confidence (without anie surmising or doubting) vppon the merites and satisfaction of Christ, yet this is not to be vnderstoode literallie▪ as the Heretikes do take it, but spirituallie, that is to say, after the glose & interpretation of the spirituall Councell of Trent, like as we haue sufficiently declared aboue. And therefore is that likewise true which Gentian doeth gather hereof, to witte, That God doth not accept or allowe the conuersion and repentance of Heretikes, for so much as it is not done, as it ought to be. And it is not an easie matter (as he saith) to make God a flexen beard. For that can none do, but our deare mother the holie Church of Rome,God with a flaxen beard. which hath foure white feete, and can not erre. Therefore hath shee (in token that she wil make God a flexen beard)

a religious custome, to make her God with a graie beard like to flexe: And in their procession, when they carrie Corpus Domini about, they doe likewise make a god with a flaxen bearde, and so beare him triumphantlie about with a Tabber & pype, in manner as though they were going to the Theater, or to the playing of a Fensers price. And howe be it, that Gentian saith, God will not be derided, or mocked, that is vnderstood by the liuing God which is in heauen, and not by the same God which our deare mother doeth keepe as prisoner in the Sacrament boxe, against her festiuall solenmizations. For that is a patient God, and is neuer angrie, but alwayes pleased alike, and at one staie: prouided alwayes, that he be saflie kept and well garded from myse, mothes and wormes, which are his deadlie foes.
            
         
         
            
            Now followeth the exposition vpon the sixth and last part of Maister Gentian Heruet his Epistle, treating of the ignorance and wicked life of the Huguenote preachers, and of the Holines of the Pope, and other Prelates.
            
               The first Chapter. Declaring the lothing of Gentian Heruet, and what we
                     •
                   must doe, when a Priest doeth lothe so much, that he doeth cast the Sacrament out of his stomache, after he hath said Masse.
               
                  IN the sixt and last part saieth Maister Gentian, that he doth maruellouslie lothe, when hee considereth the qualitie, that is, the custome and life of the newe Huguenot Preachers. But it were not good that he should consider that to much, after he hath song Masse: for otherwise he might make a mad sturre, and giue the holie Church both her hands full. He might by ouerlothing, cast a calfe, and so cause the louing God to voide his stomacke.

Were not that a goodlie loathing? It is true in deede, that the Romish church is prouided in this respect, that who so doeth cast the calfe, shall againe suppe vp the same without salt. Yet hereby might growe a greeuous matter: for the calfe might cause him to lothe more, then he did before: insomuch as the good God would lodge no longer in his stomacke, and then should we be driuen to burne him, and to keepe the holie ashes for a relique vnder some aultar. This were (in verie deede) most blasphemous, and worst of all for our deare mother the holie Church, that shee should handle the matter with her blessed God, as she doeth with Heretikes and Huguenotes.
               
               True it is, that vpon a time, when the Doctors were assembled together at Paris, and with this matter beeing greatlie encombred, there was one of the ancient which did esteeme and passe it verie lightlie, saying: Seeing hee did permit himselfe to be crucified of the Iewes, why should he not suffer him self to be burnt of vs? And thervpon was it concluded, that which (yet in these dayes) is to bee seene in the Cantils of Masses, and all

Masse bookes,
                  This is in the Masse booke, & 
                        〈◊〉
                      thus iudged in the Councel of Orlians, in the 5. Chap. 
                  to wit, that both he, and the cast Calfe, shall together bee burnt without redemption, and thereof to be made holie ashes, for to seale, on the first day in Lent, or on Ashewednesday, all good, godlie, or deuoute people therewithall on their forehead.
               
               Yet were it not meete in these dayes, to followe that Councell in burning him, seeing the Heretikes doe on all sides so ouercharge him: for if he perceiue nowe, that the Catholikes will also burne him, his heart might fal into his heeles, & cause him to loose his courage quite, and than our game were quite lost. Therefore I would wishe Maister Gentian to be friendlie in treated, not to loth so sore, especiallie after he hath said Masse: or else, if in cace his stomacke be so tender, that he cannot abide anie filthines, he ought to beware frō looking to muche on the Huguenote preachers forsomuch as they bring such lothsomnes to his stomacke.

vnlearned, which are to bee founde in the world: & after that, that they are likewise of a wicked life. But before he doth come so far, he doth aboue al, protest, That there is in some Priests & Monkes, & other religious persons, a certaine excessiue and beastly ignorāce. yea, that some do lead a verie lewde life. Which he doth handle verie wisely & circumspectly, to the end we should the sooner beleeue him to desire a reformation, aswell as others do. Like as we may lightly gather hereof (according as himselfe doth witnes) that he hath expounded the sixth article of the coūcell of Calcedonie, & permitted the same to bee extant in print. Is not this a great matter, & an vnfallible token, that he meanes the reformation of the mind? He hath assuredly deserued hereby a fatt benefice, or a Bishops myter. Yet doe I not regard so much the first point, that there are such ignorant Priestes, which cannot reade their Masse nor Dirige bokes. And if they can do that, what neede they any further? Therfore is Gentian to blame, to esteme them vnlearned: howbeit, I surmise he hath done thus, to shew that he hath learned Rhetorica, or The arte of eloquence and vtterance.

For thereby is learned, That if we seeke greatlie to rebuke any man, it cannot be done more aptlie, than by dilating and amplifying his default, in comparing him to some one, who hath bene tainted with the like. For, as touching the Monkes, it is no maruell, though they are vnlearned, seeing their profession doeth require the same: and the more ignorant they bee, the welcomer and more acceptable are they to their Couent. For those which are verie well learned, haue commonlie to much tongue, and therefore are often punished: and if then they do not mend, they are throwen into a dungeon, or are closed somewhere betwixt two walles in a seller, and there permit them to liue so long as they can. Like as might haue bene seene a yeere ago at Antwerpe, Ghaunt, and other places more, which haue remained there, some eight or ten yeeres, some twentie, and thirtie yeeres. Therefore it is no maruell, though Monkes be vnlearned: insomuch as in the Latin tongue is vsed a common prouerbe: Monacho indoctior, that is to say, A great Asse or dolt, and more vnlearned than a Monke. Yea, they haue a speciall Latin tongue for their own

vse, which the learned sorte them selues can not vnderstand, and is called,Friers latin. 
                  Friers latin, or, Kitchen latin. But touching Priestes, they neede no great learning: for, if they can but onelie repeate the fiue secrete wordes of the Masse without giuing Priscian or Despauter a bobbe on the face (that is to say,
                     Priscian or Despauterie were men, which wrote the latin Grammer, or the rules for the latin tōgue. And therfore it is vsuallie said, that those whiche speake false latin, do strike Pris. and Despau. on the face. without intermingling of Friers latin) than is the matter cocke sure: They are more learned then the Angels in heauen: for they can make God, which thing the Angels can not doe. And if besides that, they knowe but howe to brewe of the smallest sort of latin withall, then hath their sowe pigd, they may bee bold to inuite their neighbors to the feast, and serue out messes with the great Laten ladell: for then they may not onelie bee parish Priestes, but also Bishops, Prelates, Cardinals, yea Popes them selues. And what more can they craue? For, touching their life, we must alwayes coniecture the best, like as is commaunded in the Decrees, and not to thinke that those which dailie do handle God,This is openlie commaunded in the Decrees cap. in scriptis, dist. 96. would commit anie thing, that is not to be allowed. Therfore, if a Priest do kisse a maid, or grope her about the pappes, we must suppose, that

he is about to shrieue her, or doeth giue her absolution for her sinnes. And if sobe any man doth take them opēlie with the manner, he must couer, or lap them about with his own cloake, lest he make them ashamed. For they are euen by nature verie shamefast, & change collour, like a pewter platter: otherwise may not anie correct or punish thē (as is shewed before) wt the expressed wordes of the Sodomites, which would not be corrected of Loth: yea although they were the veriest smelsmocks which might liue. For they are of that nū
                  ber which plead, Noli me tāgere, Touch me not.
               
            
            
               The iii. Chapter. VVhich treateth, whether the spiritualtie doe likewise practise knauerie: and here is repeated the high & noble stocke of the Clergie, their forefathers▪ progenie, brought into 32. degrees, and ech set out and beautifi

               IN recording or calling to mind the sūme hereof,Knauerie of the Clergie. a deuout & wel disposed catholike mind might suppose, whether it were possible for the most reuerend spiritual professors (whose daily exercise is to make god, & who are created and descended from the stocke of the most holie father the Pope of Rome) might vse, or were able to exercise

any kind of knauerie or wicked dedes? God forbid, that anie such matters should passe in our thoughts. For howe were that possible? Seeing they are all sprong forth of so noble a stocke, & descended of so worthie, so righteous & holy forefathers (whose footsteps they followe so feruently) that a mans heart must melt away, to heare the same rehearsed. But to the end it may seme no iest, I will (as brieflie as I may) define their noble & worthie progenie, and set it foorth to eche mans sight, to the ende these birds may be knowen by their kind, & these coltes by their dammes. And for that eche thing may appeare substantiall, I will (after the sagest and ancientest maner of these noble Dom Cannons of Colen & Ludick) bring their stocke into 32. degrees, to wit, eight from the fathers father,
                     32. degr

For whoso can describe these degrees in their proper and deserued armes & banners, without doubt, there is nothing to be gainsaied, but that he may not only be a dom Cānon, but also freely possesse al the priuiledges of a Gentleman, and account himselfe to descend of the worthiest race.

Like as eche (who herein hath anie knowledge) will easilie condiscend. Therefore, if cace I can declare anie such thing of the old discent of the holie forefathers of the spiritualtie, then is the case sixe, and (spite their teeth) they must bee famous. For the bloud wil not lie, and a Goose can laie no Owles egges. It must be most true and certein, or Mussels are no fishe.

                     Anastatius the second. about the yeere of our Lord 500. did likewise decline from the trueth, and consented to the Nestorians,

                  He entred like a fox, raigned like a lion, and died like a dogge. For when Coelestin the fift (a good simple companion) did possesse the Sea of Rome, and for his honestie (and specially for that he commaunded the Cardinals to ride no more on horses nor Mules, but vpon asses) was by them hated & had in contempt. This craftie foxe did ordeine a man, to feine him selfe an Angel of God, who speaking through a gutter or pype which was bored through a wal, did warne Coelestine by night (as in a vision) to giue vp his charge, he being vnfit for the place, and therefore to resigne it vnto some other, more able for that function. Insomuch as this Boniface (by this subtill deuice) obteined the Popedome, mocking with God and his owne profession. And immediatlie after this, fearing least Coelestine might yet giue out him selfe for the right Pope, did throwe him into prison, and caused him there (most miserablie) to ende his life. Further, hee play

Also, he did banish and curse Sara Columna, wt all the Columneses. He refused to crowne the Emperour Albertus: and setting the crowne vpon his owne head, and girding the sword to his side, said, I am Emperour my selfe. Yet notwithstanding after that, the King of France did in his owne person crowne him, to spite the Pope: which king of Fraunce (named Philip) hee did likewise excommunicate, and adiudged him to be dispossessed and deposed from his kingdome (the same apperteining to the Emperour Albertus) because hee denied the Pope for his Soueraigne. Yet besides this, in token of his godlinesse, and to the ende eche one might knowe, that hee deririded his owne religion, It fortuned on a tyme in the Citie of Genes, that hee had in handling the Archdeane, named Prochetum, vppon the first daye of Lent, cōmonly called Ashwednesday:

Yea moreouer, did him selfe oftentimes sell one benefice to sundrie persons at one time, and made a mocke at all religions, for that hee did not onelie contemne Masses, Eeuensong, the Seuen tides, the Fasting dayes, and Abstinence: but had likewise solde Saint Iohns head (which lay in Saint Syluesters cloister) to the Florentines for fiftie thousand Duccats,

if so be he had not bene hindered from the same by the Citizens of Rome: And had said openlie in the presence of many Prelates and other honest and credible hearers, That after this life, no other was to be looked for: yea, remained vnmoueable in the same: that the soule together with the bodie, did quite die, and that there is no resurrection at all.

And yet notwithstanding, this holy father being accused of more than foure and fiftie such like articles, which were orderlie read to his face, hee answered to eche of them, sighing verie heauilie: Alas, I haue committed yet a more haynous offence than this is: namelie, for that I haue descended and come down from the moū

In respect whereof, wee may worthilie place him, to stoppe vp the neathermost hole in the bottome of these eight first noble quarters, seruing properlie for Heretikes and publike blasphemers of GOD: which for armes beare in their shieldes Foxes, Wilde Swine, Dragons, Sea horses,

               Of which, Pope Ioan the ninth, or Iuth is the right mother and most meete auncient bearer. For,Pope Iuth. as a litter of pigges are

farrowed of a fruitfull Sowe, so are the Priestes and Monkes, and all the Spiritualtie sprong from her. And in very deed, she was inflamed with such a zealous loue towards this holie generation,

Clements chappel, euen as she was deuoutlie and statelie treading in procession: By the same token, that yet at this day there doeth remaine an image of stone hewen out of the earth, & that the Popes in their processions doe neuer passe that way: fearing lest the like might happen to them also. Neuerthelesse, for the auoiding of such a chaūce, the holy Romish Church did ordeine two chaires to be heawen of Porphyr stone, where they vsed to feele frō vnder, whether the new chosen Pope was furnished of al his ware. Howbeit that custome is now left, for that they make the matter manifest by acte, and by the number of their bastards which before hande they do get.

Which fell out a sower sawce vnto him: for Marozia, daughter to the foresaid Theodora, being also a subtill strumpet, brought to passe by the helpe of her husband Guido Gouernour of Thuscane, that some of his souldiers did apprehende him at S. Iohns, in the Pallace of Lateran, in the yere 928. & there wt a cushen twhartning his mouth, did pitifully smother him. And this happened, to the ende that this Morozia might further her son Iohn the 12. (whom Pope Sergio the 3. had begotten on her in adulterie) to the holy Seat of Rome. Howbeit, that ioy did not continue, forsomuch as he (that same yere) was by a

great commociō of the citizens of Rome, deposed, and Leo the 6. set in his place. But this Leo was within seuen monethes after, in the yeare 930. poysoned by Marozia: & further (as men suppose) Stephanus the 6. who did succeede him, was serued wt the like sau
                     •
                  e, & sent to the kingdom of Mooles: Insomuch as the foresaid Iohn her sonne did (at last) achieue the holie seat againe. Nowe, this said Marozia had a sonne named Albericus, who perceiuing that he was mightie and feared in the citie of Rome, did compell the nobilitie & Magistrates of the same by oth, that they, (after the decease of Pope Agapitus who then reigned) should elect and make his sonne Octauian Pope, as in deede they did,Iohn the 13.
                   and hee was called Iohn the 13. who (forsomuch as he was descēded of whores and knaues) shewed him selfe no changeling, but declared of what stocke he came. For he was so excedingly giuē to vnchastitie, and filthie liuing, that he maintained an open stewes: and being for the same blamed by the Cardinals, from the one he cut of his nose, from the other his hand, and from the third his legges and priuie members. So that of duetie

he is to be placed in the fourth quarter amongst the noble forefathers of the spiritualtie. This is the verie same, who did vowe homage to the Emperour Otto, according to the othe which is registred in the Decrees. And hee likewise crowned the said Emperour. But when Otto had turned his backe, hee tooke part against him with his foe, the sonne of Albertus Berengarius. The which when the Emperour vnderstood, hee returned againe towards Rome: And then my lord the Pope betooke him selfe to his heeles, flying into the wilde wooddes, and would not by anie meanes come in presence of the Emperour, notwithstanding the promises and assurances whiche were made vnto him. Wherefore the Emperour caused a Councell to be gathered, wherein the Pope was complained vpon,This whole historie with the articles here set downe, are rehearsed by the Historiographers. Luitprandus almost throughout his booke. and accused with these faultes following, to wit, That he did not read his drudgerie, that in saying Masse, he did not receiue the Sacrament of the Altar, that hee had made a Deane in a stable, that hee had committed whoredome with two sisters, that he had made Bishops of children, that he had defiled manie yong virgins and widowes, that

of S. Iohns Pallaice at Laterane, hee had made an open stewes: that he had lyen by and had at will, his fathers Concubine, named Stephana, also a widdowe named Rauera, and yet an other called Anna, with a Niece of hers. Besides, that he had bin the occasion of fiers, which sūdrie times had happened, that he had broken vp windowes and gates in the night time, that he had offered vp wine to the deuill, and in gaming with dice, had inuocated & besought ayde of the deuill, wt manie such Popelie parts, which were to tedious to repeate. For which causes, he was in that Councel deposed by the Emperour (with consent of the Prelates) and in his steade was placed Leo the 8. Yet notwithstāding,This is repeated by Ioh. Marius, Nauclerus, Chron. Sigis. Robert. Barus.
                   after the Emperours departure, the whores of Rome (whom he had his friends) wrought so much with the Nobilitie of Rome, & plaied their partes so gallantlie with great summes of money, and by promising the substance and coyne of the Church, that hee was yet once againe called to the Seate, and the aforesaid Leo put of. But this soone ripe fruite was soone rotten: for hee was shortelie after,

by a man that dwelt without Rome, in the night time, thrust thorough with a dagger, beeing taken a sleepe in bed with his wife.
               And this was hee, who first taught his successours to christen belles, & caused the great bell of S. Iohns at Lateran, to be called by his owne name. After whom, wee may place Paule the 2. in the fourth degree of this quarter,Paule the 2. in this degree. who first boasted to haue al Gods and mans lawes shut vppe in his breast. So as it was no maruell, that hee did so carefullie pamper the same with ioyllie good cheare, & for the most part, past and spent his time with viewing of olde golde, and antique coynes. And further, to studie by all the meanes he could deuise, to make and set out him self proper and neate, with al maner of pearles and pretious stones: wherein hee past all his predecessours. Yea, when hee should shewe him selfe, hee did painte and coulour his face with a certein kinde of vernishe, and other like trumperie, like to his countriewomen the Courtisanes and Strumpettes of Venize, amongst whom hee had a long time gonne to schoole.

He was the first likewise, which ordeined, That the Cardinals shuld haue their close stooles, and pispottes couered ouer with Crimson veluet▪ which they (euen at this day) do yet most duelie obserue, as did sufficientlie appeare at the Councel of Trent, whither they caused such goodlie stuffe to be conueied on their Mules amongst other of their most costlie and precious iewels.
               At last (notwithstanding that hee was reported to be most cunning and famous in the arte of witchcraft and coniuring) hee could not auoide nor saue him selfe, but the deuill his good maister brake his necke, whilest he was practising his vntollerable Sodomiticall filthines, wherein hee often (after the Venetian maner) did accustome him selfe. In consideration whereof, hee must of right be reckoned in the register of this gentle generation.
               After whome (not onelie in the Popedome but also in good life▪
                  Sixtus the 4.
                  ) did follow Sixtus the 4. who was not him selfe alone addicted to this lothsome Sodomitical sinne, and to all manner of fleshlie desire besides, (whereon he consumed within the space of two yeeres,
                     Iohannes Rauisius Textor, in his booke called Officina.
                   the summe of three hundreth thousand Duccates) but further gaue licence

to all the generation & kinred of the Cardinall of Saint Lucie (who was his huntsman) that they might vse this Sodomiticall filthines in the three whotest monethes of the yeere, namelie, Iune, Iulie, & August. And this is the holy man, who hath ordeined so manie festiuall dayes, as Saint Francis &c. and of the Presentation of our Ladie. And further hath made that deuoute prayer, whiche beginneth, Aue sanctissima Maria mater Dei, Regina coeli, &c. giuing a thousand yeeres remission out of Purgatorie, to whom soeuer doeth say the same before her Image. Yea he hath also made a Saint of S. Bonauentura: wherefore it is good reason that he should likewise furnish a place amongst the companie of our Saintes.
               Immediatlie after this,Innocent the 8
                   followed Innocent the 8. who had but eight bastarde sonnes, and as manie daughters: which he fostered and brought vp all verie highlie, according to his ofspring. Yet forsomuch as he was of no great discent, and that it is but of small estimation with Popes, to haue bastardes, wee will let him steppe for such as he is.
               And place Iulius the third in the seuenthIulius the 3.

And when he was chosen Pope, he did giue vnto the said boye, as a reward for his beastlines, his Cardinals hatte, with his syrname and armes: So that he afterwardes was alwayes named by the Popes syrname, and yet is so called, namely, Cardinalin de Monte, that is to say, The litle Cardinal of Monte.
               
               Lastlie, we will place Pope Pius the 4. (nowe last ouerpassed) in the eight degree of this quarter:Pius the 4.
                   of whom our Priests, Bishops, and Prelates are (for the most part) sprong vp and proceeded. This good holie father, when hee iourneied thorough Bullin towardes Rome, at what time the the Seate was voyde, hee fained him selfe verie weake and sicklie, hoping thereby to winne the Cardinals vnto him, and that they would chose him, vpon hope, he would not tarie long by it. And when this fetche would not serue his turne, hee sought another waye: for beeing in the Conclaui, which is, the Closet of Cardinals, he did

glose with the Cardinall of Trent, as though hee would permit in Religion manie things to the Germanes, as namelie, The whole exercise of the Sacrament, & the libertie of wedlock for Priestes. But when hee perceiued that the Cardinals were greatlie offended hereat, and that all this did not further, but rather hinder his intent, he proceeded further, & did by gifts and faire promises, buie their voyces. And at the same time got for a prouerbe of the Pasquill: Impius es tu, Pater tuus latro est, Mater tua Meretrix, quomodo huc intrasti? that is to say, Thou art an infidell, thy father is a murtherer, and thy mother a whoore, how camest thou hither?
               
               For which occasion, to fetche out this shamefull staine of infidel, he would be called Pius, that is to say, Godlie. But to fall to our purpose, he loued not onelie the strū
                  pettes and Courtesanes of Rome exceedingly, but also the married wiues. Insomuch as in the latter and vttermost time of his age, besides an open and manifest Courtesane or whoore, he kept and maintained also, the wife of a certein Gentlemā of Rome, named Papyrio Capizucchi,
                  
and most commonlie did eate Oysters and Snayles, and did drinke vnto them a verie strong wine called Mangeguerra, to reuiue and prouoke his fleshlie lust.
               And when all would not helpe, insomuch as his Courtesane did opēlie deride him, as an impotent sewter, and that shee esteemed more of the foresaid litle Cardinal de Monte, he caused her to be throwen in a stinking dungeon: yet afterwardes, of meare pitie and loue did set her free again, and hauing tyred him selfe on her, in his vnnaturall luste, and further beeing desirous to solace him selfe in bedde with the foresaid Gentlewoman, did one night eate so manie Snailes, and dranke so much of the foresaide wine called Mangeguerra, thereby hauing recouered a freshe youth, that he got to bedde with her: from whence he neuer rose, but was borne wt his heeles forwardes vnder the greene coueringes. Wherevppon an Epitaph was grauen on his graue, as followeth:

                     Le Donne, Lumagi, & Mangaiguerra,

               He shall then (as of duetie to him apperteyning) shut vp the seconde eight degree, forsomuch as he had 
                     •
                  duentured his life in the daunger of whorish and most filthie incontinencie, and thereby hath purchased an euerlasting name, amongest the noble predecessours of the Clergie: who (most triumphātlie) beare in their armes, Buckes, Bulles, Beares, Leoppards,
                  Armes of the second quarter of holy Popes. 
                  Harpies, Sowes, Mares, and salte Bitches: And in their banners, the cities of Rome, of Sodom & Gomorra: of whence their noble race is proceeded: and for their squiers they haue Ammon, Absolon, Sardanapalus, and Heliogabalus.
               
               Nowe followeth the thirde eight degrees,The third eight degrees. from whence the sacred stocke of the spiritualtie is sprong vp: and these proceede most of greedie couetous persons, & rauening bloud houndes, which haue purchased the Seate with money and bribes: and further haue stirred vp great commotions and troubles, and shed much bloud. Therefore they weare in their armes, Lions, Wolues, Crocodiles, Tygres, Eagles,

Griffones, Hawkes, and Rauens. And haue for their squiers, Cain, Nemrod, Esau, Nero, and other such like. Marie in their banners, they beare the cities of Rome and Edom.
               
               The first of these Noble personages, may be Pope Formofus (who reigned about the yeare 893.) together with his aduersaries, who haue brought such dissentions and discords in Christendome, that in many yeres after could not bee appeased. For the enuie which the one bare to the other, was so monstrous and vnnaturall, that Stephanus the 6. caused the dead bodie of Formosus to be taken out of his graue,Stephanus the sixt. & congregating a Councell for the same, did first commaunde him to be clothed with a Popely habit, and after stript him of that, clothing him with laie apparel: & after cutting two of his fingers frō his right hand, caused them to be throwen into the riuer of Tiber, & then buried him as one of the vulgar & vnlearned sort: and caused all his ordinances to be voide & of no effect. To the contrarie whereof Romanus the successor of Stephanus,
                  
                     Nauclerus.
                   did establish & allow againe all his actes & ordinances, and made those which Stephanus had enacted, to bee frustrate

and of no force.

The same also did (though not without great stirre and commotion) Iohn the tenth, who did succeede him, and did not only disanull al the actes & statutes of Stephanus, but further caused them in a common and vulgar Councell to be burnt.

After the which Leo followed Pope Christopher, whō we may of right place in the second degree of this third quarter, forsomuch as he did imprison those, which had receiued anie preferrement of the foresaid Benedict the fourth, & obteined the Seat perforce: so as poore Leo through sorrowe died.
               But this great vngratfulnes of the foresaid Christopher was worthilie repaide:

once againe commaunded the foresaid bodie of Pope Formosus to be digged out of his graue,Pope Formosus beheadded. and most inhumanlie to bee beheadded, and his other three fingers to bee cut off, and so did throwe the bodie into the riuer of Tyber: yet notwithstanding was it (in the time of Anastasius the third) fisht out againe: and being in S. Peters church honestlie buried, was by the Images and woodden idols (through a speciall miracle) nodded vnto, and bid welcome: if histories do not lie. But that is a small fault: Once we will make this good man Sergius Quarter maister in this thirde degree, considering that of so worthie a fellow, all other Popes, and the whole Clergie are growen like maggots of a rotten cheese.
               
                  Boniface the 7
                  For the fourth in this quarter, we may chose Pope Boniface the seuenth, who hauing atchieued the Seate by vnlawfull meanes, began to perceiue that hee was not well thought of, nor assured at Rome. And therfore, he got him packing to Constantinople: but forgot not priuilie to steale and take with him,This historie is rehearsed by Nauclerus, Rob. Barus, and Corn. Abbas.
                   all the costlie iewels and treasures of Churches. Wherof (within eight monethes after hee was abandoned) he had made a great masse of

money, wherewithall he wrought so wilie, and blinded the eyes of all the Romanes, in such sorte, as they perceyuing no more his wickednes and naughtie dealings, did receiue him againe, and permitted themselues with the shine and brightnes of the gold to be blinded: so as he found meanes to apprehend as prisoner Pope Iohn the 15. who was placed in his roome,Pope Iohn his eies put out and hauing put out both his eyes, did famishe him (in prison) to death, and so got the gouernement vnto him againe: Howbeit, he enioyed not long, for being shortlie after ouertaken with a soudein death, was by the common people trayled alongst the streetes,

the case with you, good holy father (quoth the Bishop:) Whervnto hee answered: I am most pitifully tormented and martyred: notwithstāding the mercie of God is not quite shut from me, if so bee I may bee holpen with prayers, Masses, and Almesdeedes: and therfore shalt thou go to Iohn my successour, & tell him, that in such a coffer or chest, he shall finde a great summe of monie, which he must distribute to the poore: for whatsoeuer was giuē for me before, will not helpe, because it was stolen and euill gotten goods. Wherevpon the Bishop, hauing done his message, did forsake his Bishoprike, and placed him selfe in a Cloister. But whether this be true, or whether it be a lie, or that the diuell or some 
                     ••
                  end appeared in likenesse of the Pope, I refer it to the Doctours of Louen to iudge. Once (forsomuch as all Historiographers do witnesse alike, it is manifest, that he, as well as his predecessours, and successours, did gather the most part of their substance with rouing and stealing, and heaped the same by vngodlie meanes: wherefore it is reason, that he be also allowed a roome in this third quarter.
               
                  The sixt place in this quarter wee maye bequeath to Clement the 4. who could find out most notable meanes to fetch in monie and goods. For being crowned Pope,Clement the 4.
                   hee sent for Charles, the French kings brother, & made him chief Councellour & General ouer the citie of Rome: & further, caused him to be crowned, by his Cardinals, king of Hierusalem & Sicil: yet vpon condition, that hee should, by vowe, plight him selfe to paie yeerelie to the Church of Rome, fortie thousand crownes of golde, & should not at any time accept the Dominiō of Rome at the hands of the Almains, although it were profered vnto him.

                   And after that, in the yere 1267. when Conradinus the right and naturall king of Sicil, being fled out of the field and from the discomfiture which he had receiued of Charles, was deliuered into his handes, the Pope wrought so much by his practises, that he was at Naples, together wt 
                  Frederike Duke of the East Countrie, and others more, against al right & reason, most lamētably beheadded. Beside this, he was the cause of the x. pennie▪
                  Tenth pennie. leuied throughout all Germanie, & banished Iohn Teutonicus, because he had bent himself against it.
               
                  In summe, seeing hee coulde finde such meanes to catche coyne, it is meete, that he helpe to furnish this third part with his armes and valiant actes.
               
                  Eugen. the 4.
                  Further, in the seuenth degree of this quarter, may wee place Eugenius the 4. of whom all Popes and Cardinals, all Bishops and Prelates, and the whole Spiritualtie, are as of a fruitfull stocke sprong forth: Notwithstanding, that hee was at first driuen out of Rome by the Citizens, as one who set all things in debate, & was with stones and dartes driuen through Tyber, and so hunted out of the towne. And after that, was lawfullie and often summoned by the Councell of Basil, to appeare, being complained on for a mutiner and a stirrer of sedition, for a bloudthirstie and wicked man,Searche the Councell of Basil. and for a persecutour of the Spiritualtie. And when he would not appeare, for feare least it might haue happened to him, as it did not long before in the Councell of Constance, vnto Iohn the 23. he was (at last) lawfullie and iustlie deposed, and bannished. Yet this notwithstanding, at the last, by force of armes, with the ayde of the Dolphin of France, (who afterwardes was called Lodowick the eleuenth)

he recouered his Seate againe, after that hee had disturbed the Councell at Basil, and had raised a great tumult and schisme, the which continued more than fourteene or fifteene yeares after.
               Lastlie, for the locke of this quarter, can not be found anie more fitte than Iulius the second, of whom is written,Iulius the 8.
                   
                  That he threw Saint Peters key into the riuer of Tyber, protesting, that (thenceforth) he would vse, and helpe him selfe with S. Paules sworde. And in verie deede, he passed his whole time of Popedome with warres & effusion of bloud: For albeit that hee was maruellouslie addicted to dronkennes, and to other fleshlie filthines, and especiallie to that Sodomiticall incontinencie, like as appeared by two noble children which the Queene of France had sent to Rome by the Cardinall of Nantes, whiche did further this good holie father in his beastlie appetites: yet besides this, he had no greater pleasure in the world, than in warres. For proofe whereof, it is to be read in all Chronicles, that he (within the space of seuen yeares) had brought aboue twoo hundreth thousand persons to their ende. And therefore it is good right and reason, that

he with his armes shut vp this quarter.
               We might ouer and aboue haue brought in this quarter, manie other Popes and holie fathers of the Clergie, who mainteined the contrarie parte against the Emperours, with great commotions, warres, & bloudshed. Like as haue bene Gregorie the 7. Victor the third, Vrban the thirde, and Paschal the seconde, against Henrie the fourth: Gelasius the second, and Calixtus the second, against Henrie the fift: Adrian the fourth, and Alexander the third, against Frederike Barbarossa, which was also trode vpon with feete by Alexander. Honorius the thirde, Gregorie the ninth, and Innocent the fourth against Philippe the brother of Frederike, and against Frederike the second the first Frederiks son, and against Conrade the sonne of Frederike the seconde: And Clemens the fourth against Conradine King of Naples, and sonne of Cōrade. Insomuch as they handled the matter so roughlie, that after William Duke of Holland, the Dominion of Rome was for the space of xvii. yeeres without an Emperour, vntill that Rodolphus of Hasburg was elected for Emperour: who for that cause would not come

there, taking example (as hee said) by the Foxe, whereof Aesope maketh mention in his Fables: who being sent for by the diseased Lion, to visit him in his sicknes, like as other beastes had done, made aunswere, That the footesteppes did fraie him, which were all bent towards him, but there were none which returned againe.
               We might then (say I) rehearse all such worthie champions and holy fathers, and inserte them in this quarter, which haue so wilfullie breathed against Emperours & Gods anointed. But forsomuch as our intent is not to repete euery Popes historie, but only to manifest the noble progenie of the holy & reuerend Clergie: And that eche may very well know, that in the registre of kinred wee cannot nūber further than 32. degrees, to shew a noble discent, the rather for that wee haue brieflie touched such Popes, & their feates, where anie mention hath bin made of them. Therfore do we referre the reader in this behalf, to the Historiographers, & prosecute our last 8. quarters of the Papistical discent, wt their skutchions, banners, and quarter maisters, in due and decent order.
               So then, do these eight last quarters depend

vppon Coniurers, Necromaneers, Poysoners,The fourth and last 8. quarters & other such like, which worke with the Diuell and his crafte: and weare for their armes Owles, Howlets, Battes, Kites,

                  Crowes, Blacke dogges, and Diuels clawes. For their squiers do I know none more meete than the diuell him selfe, whom in their coniuration they inuocate, and call vpon, except they would haue Simon and Elymas the coniurers: In like manner, and for their banners, canne they not finde more fitter cities, than Rome, Babylon, and Aegypt, from whence their Gentilitie hath taken roote: forsomuch as they haue alwayes bene replenished with such diuelishnes: except they will haue hell it selfe, where their first father the Diuell long since hath farried and prepared their places.
               Nowe then, in the first commeth our Syluester the second forth as foreman, who was Pope about the yere 998.
                  Syluester the 2. the coniurer. This was first a Monke, at Flueria (vnder the dominion of Orleans named Gerbertus,) and after that, beeing remoued to Ciuill in Spaine, to studie & applie his booke, got a Maister who was skilfull and of great experience in this arte, and by the ayde of his

maisters daughter, with whom he was verie familiar, did steale one of his especiall and chiefest bookes in that art, & got him packing therewithal, without saying farewell. And to the end he should not be trapt in his theeuerie, he did bequeath the Diuel his soule, with a solemne oth: alwayes prouided, that he might returne into France, and be prosperous in his attempts. After that, he became a Schoolemaster, and further, maister to Otthonis the third,
                     Platina and all other histories. and to Robert Hugon Capets sonne, and to Lotharius, by whose ayd he was made Archbishop of Rhenes: howbeit, Benedict the 7. deposed him as an Heretike and Coniurer. Yet after that, by the helpe of Otthonis the 3. whom he had taught his art, he became Bishop of Rauēna, and at last, to be short, Pope of Rome: and made with his maister the deuill a compact, that hee shoulde liue so long, till hee said Masse at Hierusalem, supposing that the same woulde neuer haue happened. But the maister deceiued the scholer: For in the citie of Rome was a Chappell, which was called Hierusalem, in the Church of the holie Crosse, and saying Masse there, hee waxed sicke, and perceiued the Diuels

comming for him to their feast. And herevpon the Historiographers declare, that he became penitent, and confessed openlie his offences, commanding that his dead carcase should be throwen vpon a carre, & the oxen permitted to drawe it▪ whither they would: so the oxen drewe the carre before Saint Iohns church at Lateran, where he lies buried: and it is said that he wroght manie miracles there. Yea, this is to bee seene before the same church pictured verie brauelie in a table. And therefore this holie Syluester shall occupie the first place in this last quarter, forsomuch as of him are proceeded all other hellish fathers, which with their plaguie spiritualtie haue possessed and replenished the world.
               After this may follow Iohn the 19. who likewise had friendlie and familiar conference with Robin goodfellow,Iohn the 19. This is writtē by Benno the Cardinal, and Blondus the Historiographers. like as had bene taught him in the schole of the foresaid Syluester, and with the ayd of his maister the Diuell, gotte the Popelie triple crowne on his head, about the yere 1005. but possessed it but 5. moneths. And after, went to catch Moles, proceding forwards to view his masters Maygame in Purgatorie, or thereabout. Yet in that short time,

he did great good: For he confirmed All soules day, which then was newlie inuēted and first registred in Clunie Abbie by Odilius. I suppose he knew before,
                     Robert. Barus, & Supple. Chron.
                   that he should shortlie after goe visit the soules in Purgatorie, and helpe them there to celebrate their feast.
               The third place we cannot by right attribute to any sooner,Benedict the 9
                   then to Benedict the ninth, who before being called Theophilactus, had lien at studie together with one Laurentius, Archpriest in the schole of the foresaid Gisbertus (who after was called Syluester the second) and was faithfullie instructed in his worthie science, whereby he atchieued the Popelie Seate, and farre surpassed his Uncle Benedict the 8. (who had reigned not long before him) in al subtiltie and craftie dealings, like as histories make mention: Hee reigned in the dayes of Conrad 2. & Henrie 3. And after being departed this life, appeared to an Heremit, in the likenesse of an horrible & vnnatural beast,This historie is rehearsed in Supplem. Chron. Ma

                        e historiarum Fasciculus Tempor. and others hauing head & taile like an Asse, & the rest of his bodie like a Beare. And being knowen of the Heremite, & demanded what the same signified, made ananswer, that he ought not to maruel therat,

considering that by Gods iust iudgement he was perpetually cōdemned to the same, as one who after a beastly manner had liued without faith, and beleefe, without reson and Lawe in this worlde. Like as by all credible histories is vniformally declared: and therefore was in his life time complained vpon for many shameful actes which he had committed. And in the thirteenth yeare of his Popedome was banished Syluester the third being chosen in his roome,
                     Iohannes Marius, Fasciculus Temporum.
                   who also was deposed within nine and fourtie dayes after, as an vnmeete and vnlearned man. And the foresaide Benedict put in againe, who within a while after was put forth againe, & Gregorie the sixt taken in his steed.
                     Iohannes Marius, and Mare historiarum.
                   Howbeit some Historiographers wil say, that he was not deposed the second time, but did of meere couetousnesse for ready monie sel his title vnto the saide Gregorie.
                  
                     Robertus Barnes, & Nauclerus.
                   In fine, this is the effect, That there were the same time three Popes at Rome: namely, Benedict, Syluester, and Gregorie, who did all at once draw for the longest cut, & drew so long, till the fourth named Gratian did arise,
                     Gratianus.
                   who had likewise gone to schoole with Syluester the second, and played his part so neately,

that he bought all their three partes, and became Pope him selfe. Howbeit, that he, like a Simoniake, that is, one which was crept in with coyne, was first by the Spiritualtie of Rome, and after by the Emperour Henrie in a generall Councell deposed, and one promoted to his place, called Sindegerus, who (after that) would be called Clemens the second. But hee likewise made the matter short:

                   for nine monethes after stept Damasus the seconde in place, hauing poysoned the other: and scaled the Romishe Seate him selfe without a ladder, that is, without election of the Commonaltie, or helpe of the Clergie.Damasus the 2
                   Wherefore we may allowe him the fourth degree of this last quarter: considering that in those dayes the most part of Popes and other Prelates were addicted to sorcerie and poisoning, with other diuelish deuises: whereof histories do sufficientlie witnesse, and make mention at large.
               The fift place (by all reason) doeth belong to Gregorie the seuenth,Gregorie the

                   whiche before was named Hildebrand, who (as histories declare) did temper his Triacle so well, that as good as fiue or sixe Popes were by the Italian Dramme brought to

their baine, to the ende hee might finde a readie beaten and troden pathe to their place:
                     Fascic. tempor.
                   yea he was also a scholer of the forenamed Syluester. Forsomuch as Syluester (as hath bene shewed) did instruct Laurence the Archpriest, and Theophilactus (who after was called Benedict the 9.) and Laurence did teach this Hildebrand, who thereby atteined to the holie Seate. And notwithstanding that first in a Councell holden at Worms, he was for a coniurer and craftie villain, who by policie had obteined the Popedome, and also after that, in a councell holden in the citie of Brixne by manie Nobles and Bishops, & lastlie in a councell at Mentz, as a Simoniake, or a merchant of Benefices, & a seditious mutiner, deposed from his Seate▪ being accused & lawfullie charged, that he

Yet, all this notwithstanding,

he wrought so much with helpe of his master whom he serued, that he againe (like to a cat) did clamber on his seat, and did work all the spight & hurt which he could deuise vnto the Emperour Henrie the 4. suborning certain persons, some with treason, some with poyson, & some with other treacherie & subtile deuises, to procure his end. And the better to atchieue his intēt, did cō
                  monlie beare in his bosome a booke of Necromancie. Yea his Secretarie Iohn the Bishop of Portua, did testifie in a publike sermon, that he had committed such factes,This declaret

               What say you then, was not this fellow holie ynough, to occupie the fift place in this noble quarter?
               Go to then, after him may followe in this quarter Iohn the 21, (who reigned in the yeare 1276.
                  Iohn the 21.
                  ) for that he did giue such credit to his knowledge of Geometrie, and to the Geometricians or starre Prophetes, that he spared not to say, That by the same hee was assured to liue a long time. But he deceiued none more than him selfe. For he continued but eight moneths in his Popedome, being soudeinlie slaine in the citie of Viterben, by the falling of a chamber, which hee had caused there to be built: so as it is manifest, that this was one of the diuels prankes, who had assured him so finelie of a long life.
               Nowe for to furnish the seuenth part of

this last quarter, we can find none more fit than Alexander the sixt,Alexander the 6.
                   who before was named Rodorike Borgia: and being Cardinall sought by all meanes possible, to waxe Pope: finding in the ende no waye more commodious to atchieue the same, than by framing him selfe to the studie and exercise of Necromancie or black science: which art he most diligentlie did applie, & thereby examined the diuels, whether they would willinglie and without grudging, prefer him to the Popelie crowne. Whervnto they presentlie consented, with condition, that he should be sworne to be subiect and seruiceable in all matters vnto them: wherevnto with right good will hee also did condescend: desiring onelie, that when this compact should be confirmed, the diuell should not appeare in any fearful likenesse, to demaunde the accomplishment of his othe, but should shewe him selfe in the habit and semblance of a Protonotarie. The diuell (who could not haue wished a better vizard) was soone intreated to shew him that pleasure. So it fortuned on a time, that the Cardinall did walke in the auncient citie of Rome, to the mount called Monte cauallo, and drewe him selfe aside

in a sommer parler, or place of pleasure, where byding alone, his lord the Protonotarie came also treading in, in the similitude of a comelie middleaged man, seemely apparelled wt the habit of a priest. And hauing taken the oth of the Cardinal according to his wish and prescribing, did assure him to become Pope: & that agreed verie friendlie vpon the time wherein Borgia should reigne as Pope, to wit, 1108. In fine Borgia was made Pope, and gaue himself throughly to al maner of pleasure & desire of his flesh. Hee laye with his owne daughter named Lucretia, whiche neuertheles was vsed in like case the same time by his sonne her owne brother, called Valentin Borgia: insomuch as of his daughter he did not onlie make his bride, but also his daughter in law, like as her Epitaph (extant on her graue) doeth expreslie declare. Hee caused likewise the good man Hieronymus Sauonarola to bee burnt at Florence, because hee did boldlie preache against his wicked life and doctrine. Besides this, hee did couenant and agree with the Marranes, which is, with the reuoked Christians. Yet further, after hee had committed manie murthers, as well

with his owne handes, as also thorough the meane of his aforesaid sonne Valentin, who had raised a commotion through all Italie, and had brought Iacobus Caietanus, the Cardinal Vrsin, and the Abbatte Aluiane, with manie other more, to their ende. Hee would at last at a banket (which verie liberallie hee had prepared) haue poysoned a Cardinall: So it chaunced, that through mistaking the one bottell for the other, hee which filled the drinke, did serue the poyson to the Pope him selfe: insomuch as hee therewith did swell, and became exceeding sicke. The while nowe, that good counsell with him was deare and farre to seeke, he sent one of his most trustie seruauntes called Modena, into a studie ioyning next to a chamber where he laye in bedde, to fetche a prettie golden booke of Necromancie, which hee had alwayes most carefullie kept amongest his costlie and chiefest iewels. And as the aforesaid seruaunt mas entring into the studie, he sawe the aforenamed Protonotarie sitting in the Popelie habit, who did so well resemble his maister in all respectes, as if it had bene him selfe.

Whereat being greatlie frighted, and in a manner halfe dead through feare, did retire backe, vntill his maister the Pope had reuiued him againe, and then aduenturing the second time to enter the studie, was asked of the Diuell, what he had there to do, who answered, that the Pope had sent him for a booke. Then roared the diuell with a terrible noyse, and cried out: I am Pope my selfe: wherewith he vanished away. After the which time, the Pope began to hasten toward his end. Yet a litle before his death, did his maister appeare once more in likenesse of a Poste or Purseuant, and hauing had long conference & a longer discourse with him, did teache him his Arithmetick, or his table of numbring, effectuallie giuing to vnderstand, that eleuen & eight did signifie eleuen yeares and eight dayes, and not nineteene yeares, so as the Pope had reckoned without his host. And then with a filthie stinck he departed from my lord the Pope, who immediatlie after followed, and with his faithfull maisters departed this world into the Popes heauen. Nowe, seeing his Requiem is a singing, wee will affoarde him this seuenth place in the last quarter.
               
                  The last and best, which may not onlie conclude the fourth quarter, but also shutte and seale vp the whole registre of kinreds with his noble armes and Popelie actes, is Paule the third, whose high renoumed & noble feates do shewe them selues,Paule the 3.
                   partlie in all the foure quarters: for he is at first, a kinne to the fathers of the first quarter, insomuch as he was, all his life time, a notable Epicure: openlie skoffing at Christ the sonne of God, and esteeming the worde of God for a vaine fable. Like as they do sufficientlie know, which in his time haue frequented and bene at Rome.
               
               After that, he is a kinne likewise to those of the second eight quarters, forsomuch as he was not simplie a whoremonger, but besides the women which he defiled, being the Popes Legate, was by his kinsman Nicholas Querceo, taken with the manner, whereas he beeing a bedde with his owne cousine germane Laura Fernesia,

                   wife to the said Nicholas, was for the said cause, by him thrust with a dagger into his bodie, whereof hee bore the scarre to his graue. Yea he did lie with his own daughter Constantia:

                   and to the ende he might the more safelie do the same, did poyson her

husband named Bosa Sforza. He had also a sonne called Peter Aloysius,
                  
                     Peter Aloisius.
                   who knewe verie well how to followe his fathers footsteppes. For besides innumerable shamelesse and most detestable crimes, whiche would be to tedious to repeate: he did perforce rauish the Bishop of Fanes, and misvsed him, with helpe of his seruants, to the satisfying of his most horrible Sodomiticall lecherie, whereof the good Bishoppe (through sorrowe & anguish of heart) died: which notwithstanding, the good sonne got of the holy father for a reward of his good deed an Earldome of fortie thousand Duccates a yeere. But what maruell is it, that he forbore & mainteined his sonne in such a dishonest and detestable life, seeing him selfe through the whoredome of his sister Iulia Fernesia,
                  
                     Iulia Fernesia.
                   which she had committed with Pope Alexander the sixt, was called to be one of the colledge and fellowship of Cardinals? Forsomuch as shee did threaten to forsake the Pope, vnlesse hee would bestowe on her brother a Cardinals hatte. After this he doeth claime kinred of the third 8. quarters: considering he kept open shop or market of all manner of benefices, & merchādise. For being by Pope Clemēt
                  
(who lay at Rome as prisoner in the Palace called Castra de Sancto Angelo) sent of an Embassage to the Emperour Charles, would not take it vppon him, but that the Pope must first preferre his yong Nephewe to the Bishoprike of Parma, who was but a childe of x. yeres olde: and afterwards being Pope, did giue all, or most part of this treasure perteyning vnto the Churches, vnto his friends and kinsfolkes, as well women as men: yea solde from the Duke of Ferrara two townes called Modena & Rhegium. He alienated also Parma & Plasancia, & gaue them to his friēds. He was not abashed to raise all manner of strange impostes & taxes, & to demaund of his subiectes 3000 Duccates a yere, and besides that sometimes the tenths, sometimes the one half of their fruits, to gnaw the cōmon people to the verie bones, & gather mony from al quarters & corners. And further touching bludthirstines & murther, therin he was doctor long before he got the Cardinals hat on his head: for in the daies of Pope Innocēt, he was throwē into Bocardo for two murthers by him cōmitted, & for poysoning his owne mother and nephew:Murthers committed by Pope Iulie. insomuch as he hath also deserued a

place in this fourth and last quarter: considering he was so skilfull in tempering an Italian figge, that hee did not spare his owne naturall mother. Yea after that did bring his owne sister to her baine, who otherwise was none of the holiest. Besides this, he was a necessarie and toward companion in Necromancie & diuelish artes: as appeared by his indeuour and diligence in preferring (so much as in him laye) all those of the same science, to witte, Cecius, Marcellus, Gauricius the Portugal, and other more his approued friendes and fellowe studentes. To conclude, he is the verie same, wt whom we neede to fill vp this beaderowle, and to bring these two & thirtie noble degrees vnto one notable stocke or graft, from which all our holie Clergie, all our triple crowned Popes, all bloudie Cardinals, all mytred Bishops, all lazie Abbattes, fat Curates, houdded Monkes, idle Channons, Massepriestes, shauen Clerkes, fysting Nonnes: In fine, all the shauen sorte are proceeded and sprong vp, and further, haue filled the earth, as with a heape of grassehoppers.
            
            
               
               The iiii. Chapter. Declaring that the lewde and wicked life of Priestes can not be a let to the administration of their Sacrament. And herein is treated, the briberie, and chopping of benefices vsed in the holie Church of Rome.
               SEeing then that our Clergie is descended of so high, holie, renoumed, noble, and right honorable stocke, of all sides, that they can shewe and declare all the armes and banners of their predecessours, so exactly & perfectlie: wherefore then shoulde they not (as of right to them apperteineth) possesse their fathers rentes & reuenewes, and enioye all the priuileges which of old are bequeathed and giuen vnto them: and which (manie hundreth yeares ago) they haue alwayes vsed? Good reason then, that they should after the auncient accustomed manner of their olde mother the holie Romishe Apostolical and Catholike Church, inuocate and call for helpe of their old fathers, whensoeuer anie heauines or trouble doeth seeme any way to come vppon them. And especiallie in this, that our maister Gentian doth here diligently treate vpon, to witte, that the wicked and lewde life of Priests cannot staine or disgrace the commendable and worthie order of their admission

to be Priest. And it is in deede true, for else the matter would cotton but ilfauouredlie with our louing mother the holy church: for to the end I neede not rehearse euery seuerall part,Looke before in the 5. chapter of the firste parte. we haue heard aboue, that the decrees do mention: If anie Pope or other religious person doe wt Simonie, that is to say, with giftes or briberie, with affection or friendship, or with anie other vndecent meane, obteine a benefice, liuing, or other spirituall stipend, the same shal not onely be banished & accursed, but beside al whatsoeuer he doth, or ordein, shalbe accounted without force, voide, and of none effect. And al Priestes and those of the Clergie placed and appointed by him, shal likewise be banished & excommunicated with him. Nowe helpe good Ladie of Walsingham: for is it possible to find one amongst ten thousande, whiche can get his benefice otherwise, than by such prettie practises & cunning sleights? I refer that to the right worshipful Abbat of S. Bauen at Gaunt, & to the Secretarie Argēterus, & to Morilliō
                   the Cardinal of Grandveile his brokers,
                     Vigilius. A Argenterus. B Morilion. C
                   which were wont to be called the A.B.C. of benefices (because he had so many benefices, as there are letters in the

crisse crosse rowe) I refer it (I say) to their consciences, if perhaps there is anie conscience at all left in them. They know how indulgēces & aduousons of benefices were wont to be dealt withal. They knowe also, what subtill practises that the good Cardinal Grandville hath brought vs in the low countries, to scumme the best fat from our pots, with the scummer of indulgences, & sheare the sheepe, where others sheare the hogs. I referre me also to the Notaries, Bull writers, Registres, and Secretaries of the Romish court: they know what notable gaine they yerelie put vp by their boxes for all the pardons, dispensiues, expectatiues, priuileges, Bulles, newe prouisos, Vocatories, Commendaticus, Absolutions, Dispēsations, for to cōpasse three, foure, or ten benefices at once, for Protonotariships, Promotions of Chaplaines, Conseruatories, Reuocatories, Reductions, Exemptions, and other such like paultrie more, which wee haue rehearsed before.
               But I pray you, was there euer anie Pope, whiche obteined his place otherwise, than by giftes or bribes, or with open force and armed hande?
               
                  That appeareth sufficientlie by the horrible schismes,Peruse Iohn Marius, and other Historiographers. contentions, murther, and warres, wherwith histories are so throughlie replenished, that it is wonderfull. Mentioning at last of 22. manifest schismes, wherein were sometimes two, sometimes three: yea foure Popes at once, eache contending most stiflie against the other to winne the bell: and that continued sometimes three or foure, sometimes tenne or twentie: yea sometimes thirtie and fourtie yeares.
               But I omit all the rest, onelie calling to mind the late passed Pope Pius the 4. Hath not he openlie on a time with redie monie,
                     Pius the 4. an other time by faire promises, bought the voyce of Cardinal Caraffa, and his adherents (which alwayes helde the contrarie part against the Ferneses, and Mantuans?) Did not he promise the said Cardinall a pension of manie thousande Ducates a yeare, to receiue them out of the reuenues of the Bishopricke of Toledo in Spaine, which he by meanes of the Duke of Florence (who was suretie for the same) would cause him to obteine, and also certeine Fortes and Castles situate in the lande of Naples, which hee should deliuer

into the hands of the Duke of Paliano? And at last, when the time of paiment was come, he caused the Cardinal to bee throtled with a napkin about his neck, and his brother the Duke of Paliano to be beheadded, and further paiment they might seeke where they could. But what neede I (by sundrie examples) declare, that which a calfe with one eie might lightlie perceiue? The Lawier Marsilius Patauin him selfe could wel discerne this, and by writing testifie with these wordes following:
                     In defension

               The same did the Monke Baptista Mantuan lament, writing thus:

               Which might be thus Englished:

                     we giue all for gaine.
                  
               
               Wherewith a good Abbat doth finelie agree, who being asked, Papa cuius partis orationis? That is to say: What part of speeche is this word, Pope?
               
               Answered, that it was Participii partis, Quia partem capit a Clero, partema Seculari, partem ab vtroque, cum totius orbis doloris significatione, sine modis & temporibus. That is to say:
               
                  This word Pope is a participle, or of the qualitie of those which put foorth their hands on both sides of the dishe: for he receiues of the Spiritualtie, hee receiues of the Temporaltie, & doth parte stakes on both sides, without measure or end, to the great anguish and sorowe of all the world.

                  ice buiers must alow the Pope, do amount onelie in France, yere by yere, but to tenne times an hundreth thousand Crownes. Yea in the time of Pope Pius the 2. were void in France aboue twentie, so of Archbishoprikes as Bishoprikes, which brought to his coffers, a hundreth & twentie thousand Crownes. After that, he receiued not much lesse of xl. Abbies which were likewise voide in his time. And further of Priories, Deanties, and Parsonages, he got in no lesse than an hundreth thousand Crownes. And aboue all these were there about an hundreth thousand parish Churches & Pastorships, which the one wt the other did eche alow to the Pope xxv. Crownes. Behold, and consider, if this doth not in the whole amount vnto xxviii. times an hundreth thousande, and more, xl. thousand Crownes? Reckon then, and ouercast all the other profites, besides the

first fruites. And then ponder what a monstrous summe of money, al other countries (throughout all Christendome) doe bring together, which in a manner are serued with the like sawce. I omit the reuenewes which he receiueth, and is paid euerie yere by the strumpets of Rome, amounting (for eche paid a Ducate) aboue fortie thousand Ducates: besides that which he dueth likewise get of the Iewes: and further, that which is brought him in the chamber of penance, where the remission of all sinnes are rated and taxed at a certen price: like as we haue touched before, and graunted dispensations, for to marrie with their neerest kinred, whiche is not allowed to anie, but such as be riche. For thus soundeth the text:

               That is to say:
               
                  And note diligentlie, that such fauour and dispensations are not alowed to the poore, for they are not, and therefore can not be comforted.
               
               Behold, this is a text of the Bible, which

speaking of the people of Israel, vnder the name of Rachel, saith, that she is mournfull, and doth bewaile her children, and can not be comforted, because they are not present. This doeth the holie Romish Church vnderstand of the poore fellowes, which haue no Ducates or Crownes of golde, and therefore can not be relieued in the chamber of penance: where none finde ease, but such as will come off, and deale liberallie. But who were able to declare al the sundrie merchandizes, fines, trumperies, and simonie of the most holie fathers and Pope of Rome? It is euen a verie bottomles poole, whiche doeth surpasse mans capacitie. Insomuch as wee neede not maruell, that Pope Iohn the 22. after his discease, did leaue vnto his successours, xxv.

                   or xxv. times thousand thousand Crownes in redie monie, which after our reckoning, is fiue hundreth tonnes of golde. Besides all that, which he (whilest he was Pope) did wastfullie spende and consume with whores and knaues, with sumptuous and daintie fare, with riot and banqueting, and other such like Popelie holinesse, the which vndoubtedlie was an infinite masse of monie.
               
                  
                  In his booke called, Sylua locorum commun.
                  Therefore it is, that the Archbishop of Maydenburg, noting this summe, and hauing cast and reckoned, that in the time of Pope Martin the fift, were brought into Rome, as good as nine millians of golde, which is, nine times thousande thousande Crownes onelie out of France, with great admiration vsed these wordes, Iudicet timoratus, quae vorago haec: That is to say, Each one which feareth God, record and iudge hereby, what an vnsatiable & bottomlesse poole this is.
               
               But what nedeth further repetition hereof? Euerie one doth know wel inough, that al things with the Popes of Rome, are set at sale. And this appeareth sufficiently by the worthie actes of the holy fathers Alexander the 6. and Leo the tenth. For of the first did Iohn Picus Prince of Mirandula write thus:

                     Vendit Alexander,
                     Cruces, Altaria, Christum:
                     Emerat ipse prius,
                     Vendere iure potest.
                  
               
               That is to say:

                     Vpstart Pope Alexander,
                     and out with his male,
                     
                        And made vp his market:
                     What set he to sale?
                     Christ (by Saint Maerie)
                     Altars, and Crosses,
                     He bought them, to sell them:
                     Men liue not by losses.
                  
               
               And of the other did the learned Poet Accius Sannaharius indite as followeth:

                     Sacra sub extrema
                     Si forte requiritis hora,
                     Cur Leo non potuit
                     Sumere? vendiderat.
                  
               
               That is to say:

                     If this to knowe be your intent,
                     Why Leo, at his dying day,
                     Could not receiue the Sacrament:
                     What other cause did lette, (I pray?)
                     But that, for greedie gaine of gold,
                     Out of his hands the same he sold.
                  
               
               But if promotions and benefices were onelie to be solde for monie and bribes, then were our deare mother the holy church to be borne with, and not greatly to bee blamed. But what helpeth it? It is apparantlie perceiued, that they are to be gotten by Ruffianlike liuing, whorehunting, periurie, and abhominable Sodomiticall filthinesse.
               
                  For to the end I let slip, that Pope Paulus the third, after that he was put by the third time, did at last obteine a Cardinals hatte, by the importunate instigation of his sister Iulia Fernesia, Pope Alexanders strumpet, who threatened to forsake him, vnlesse he would admit her brother into the honest and worthie fellowshippe of Cardinals. To the end I also let slip the forenamed litle Cardinal of Monte, who by his filthie Sodomitical mildemeanour, possessed the Cardinals hat of Pope Iulius de Monte. Those which haue but a while frequented Rome, can testifie, that it is a common order & vsuall course: yea, it is not of to day nor yesterday, but it is one of the olde traditions or customes of the holie Romish Church, which she without setting downe in writing, hath receiued from the father to the childe, or from heire to heire, and doeth still followe the same. For Pope Benedict the twelfth, who him selfe made a decree, forbidding, That to the vndeserued, or such as were vnworthie, should not anie benefice bee giuen, did notwithstanding in the yeare 1336. offer the learned man Francis Petrarcha a Cardinals hat, vppon condition,

that he should deliuer him his sister for a Concubine.This is rehearsed in the life of Petrarch. of that which is written of Vergerio & Squarciasico, which within 
                        ••
                     le did liue vpon the said time. Wherevnto Petrarcha aunswered, That hee had no neede of so fowle or filthie a hatte. Yet his brother Gerard Petrarcha consented thereto, and deliuered his sister to the holie father for a Cardinals hat. But when the Pope had satisfied his desire with her, and did not paie the hat, the good man did despaire, & got him selfe away into a Catholike cloister or religious house.
               Such merchandize is a dailie thrift to the Romish Pilates and holy fathers. And therefore might Peters barke suffer shipwracke, if vpon their holines and honestie you would builde the worthie state of Prelatshippe and spirituall callings, and the Masse with the seuen Sacramentes. For admit they had obteined all their liuings, benefices, and shauen crownes, by their worthines and holie actes, yet might wee not heare their Masses, so long as they haunt and vse the companie of their pretie Minions, by vertue of the councel of Mantua, wherein is expreslie forbidden, That wee shall not heare the Masse of anie Priest, whom we knowe to exercise the companie of anie women.
               
               
                  And nowe I referre the matter to the consciences of Priestes, Monkes, & Cannons, whether the holiest amongst them al, do alwayes refraine and keepe themselues from the haunt of harlottes. Forsomuch as it is knowen and manifest, that the cōmon sorte are not content with one proper bedfellow, as we may sufficiently perceiue by the Popes and other Prelates their bastardes, with which they haue replenished the world, and haue distributed their lands and liuings amo
                     •
                  gst them. And therefore must we alwayes be mindfull of this rule: that whēsoeuer we heare ought of Priests or Monkes, whiche soundeth not well, yet the same cannot be preiudicial or hurtful to their state or calling, or hinder the vertue of holie Masse: yea it is sanctified & made holie through the worthinesse of the person him self, how wicked and sinfull soeuer the fact can be.

For this hath our mother the holie church after this sorte concluded: That in case the Pope shoulde for readie monie sell all the Spirituall goods, all benefices and prebendes, and all the trumperie, one with the other, yet may not that be reckoned for Simonie, so long as the holinesse of his person can

washe and cleanse away all stayned spots and filthinesse. Yea, of a sinne canne hee make a good and godly worke, as is shewed before. And the Pope with the holie Church of Rome can no further bee tainted with this crime of Simonie or briberie, than that the Court of Rome maye bee called Monarcha Simoniae,
                  This is repeated by Restau. Castaldus, in tractat. de Imperat.
                   that is to say, A Monarche or Dutchesse of Spiritual theeuerie. And therefore Bribeberie or Simonie canne not bee founde at Rome.
               And as concerning other factes, the Pope can wholie dispense with them: insomuch as the holie Church is out of daunger, yea although shee were as full of villaines and reprobates, as an egge is full of meate.
            
            
               The v. Chapter. VVhich treateth of the ignorance of Hugnenote preachers, and the great and singular learning, capacitie, weightie and deepe grounded questions of Catholike Doctours.
               NOwe let vs proceede with our Huguenote Ministers and Preachers, and paint them forth in their colours. Go

to then, maister Gentian saith: They are vnlearned, and of a wicked life. Touching the first point, their ignorance is easilie perceiued by this, in that they will not say and sing their Pater Nosters, Benedictions, or thankesgiuing, Psalmes, and other prayers in Latine, but alwayes vse their owne mother tongue. Truelie if they had their latine tongue so prompt and readie, as the Priestes haue it in their Masses and Diriges, they would not be so charie and daintie of it. In deede, it is verie true, that some of them haue not onlie the latine tongue, but also the Greeke and Hebrewe more perfecte & readie, than the Priestes and Monkes haue their Kirieleyson and Per omnia. But in primis, it is Heretical Latine, and of this new sorte, which is vnknowen, (much lesse vsed) amongest the Doctors of Louen, Colen, and Paris, and such as the holy Romish Church can not skill of. On the other part, there are some amongst them, which know no more latine then our Monkes and Parish priestes: yea they will not boast or crake to knowe anie thing, saue onelie Iesus Christ, & the same crucified:1. Cor. 2.2. and perswade them selues, that that alone, (at least) is worth as much, as

all the Doctors copes, Aristotles breeches and lyripypes, which our Magistri nostri and Supermagistri at Louen haue wonne with great and painfull industrie. But when all is said, are their learned sort such iolly fellowes? Are they of thē selues able to dissolue one of those questions, which our maisters of Louen with great heapes do daylie deliuer? and breake their braines about them, in such sort, that when they come abroad in the aire, their heades are lapt and wrapt about with cloutes and ragges, as though they were in danger to breake and fall asunder? Ywys syr no. He had neede to be a wylie Woodcocke, which shuld be able to dissolue such indissoluble questions. For beholde, these are they, whereby they permit their studentes to proceede Bachelers, Maisters of arte, and Doctours: Namelie, to knowe, Whether God be able to sinne?
                  Questions of Catholike Doctours. 
                  If he were able to hate his Sonne? If it were in his power to commaund anie thing, that is euil? If he might haue created the world in better condition than he hath done? If he could haue created a father without a childe? Or a childe without a father? Or a hill without a valley? If hee

were able of a whore to make a virgine againe? Also, whether the sonne of God could haue taken a womans shape vpon him? Yea, if he could turne him selfe into the likenes of a Diuell? Or take vpon him the nature of an Asse? Whether hee could not haue bene a peeble stone? A Pompin? or Colewort? And if hee had become a Pompin, howe then would he haue preached? Also, whether our Ladie was borne pure and without sinne? Further, howe manie companies of Angels there be? Who sits on the highest end & who on the lowest: who goeth before, and who folowes after? Moreouer, what is done in hell? With what sort of tongs and bellowes the fire is kindled? Howe hotte Purgatorie is? Wherewith all it was separated from hell? How long the soules must frie in it, before they bee inough? Besides them which we haue rehearsed, concerning Mise which were cerpt into the Sacrament box, what they find there to gnaw vpon, considering it is changed from bread? Howe long the man in the Moone will tarie there, and when he taketh his flight? Whether the host be poysoned when there is any poison

mixt with the bread? And whether flies dare presume to beshite it? With other more weightie questions without mesure or end, wherein the Heretikes are nothing seene, nor can tell no more of, than of the wind which last blew of my hat: & therfore it must of necessitie followe, that they are most ignorant & vnlearned. They suppose it is nowe, as it was in the dayes of Paul & the other Apostles, whē there was no talke of Bachelers nor Masters of Art: when as Quotlibets, horned or forked Sillogismes, Quidditates, Identitates, Realitates, and other such like rattes nestes, were not yet found out, when Fishermen were preachers, and Tanners Apostles. And therefore are they all busie with their Paul, and their Prophetes,

                  But we pratle in vaine, they must (at the least) go yet these ten yeares to schoole, if they will be reputed and taken for learned. What tattle I of ten yeares? A wise Doctour of Diuinitie said to Erasmus, That in nine yeares could not be vnderstood, what onelie Scotus, in his argument vpon Petrus Lombardus, had written. And another said, That it was impossible to conceiue one sentence or place in Scotus, except hee had Aristotles Metaphysickes at his fingers endes.
                  
                     Metaphysica is to say, those things which surpasse nature as Spirits, Angels, &c. And it is the name of a booke which Aristot. hath written of supernaturall things. What a good yeare meane these Heretikes then, that they are learned, because they haue read the Bible, or S. Paule, or Augustine and Hierome? Or because they vnderstand Hebrew, the Chaldean, and Greeke tongues? They must to it a litle better, and must yet these twentie or thirtie yeares goe beate their braines in their common scholes, and drawe Aristotles breeches ouer their eares: or else they shal remaine but vnlearned doltes all their life time, and can neuer proceede Maisters of Arte, or Bachelers, I say not Doctours: Yea, although they had eaten seuen Bibles, and know asmuch as euer did Paule. Therefore it is no maruell, that maister Gentian doeth cast in

their teeth, and vpbraideth them with their ignorance: forsomuche as they did neuer tast the knowledge and doctrine of our mother the holie Church, nor yet the wisedome of the deepe grounded and surpassing learned Louanistes.
               
            
            
               The .vi. Chapter: Declaring the life and reformation of Huguenote Preachers, and the citie of Geneua and to the contrarie, of the great vertues & valure of the citie of Rome: and of the loue and kindnesse of the church of Rome. And of the taxations or rate booke of the penaunce Parloure.
               COncerning their liues, Maister Gentian doeth put in vre his arte, whiche he learned of the Oratoures and maisters of eloquence and filed speaking: Forsomuche as he doeth first burden his contrarie partie, with suche crimes, as his owne conscience doth pricke him for, and findes himselfe guiltie in: Notwithstanding he doeth handle the matter very circumspectlie: For he saieth but that, hee hearde say, That in the Citie of Potiers in Fraunce, was executed a Huguenote Preacher, who had (all his life time) bene a thiefe, and murtherer: and had with his owne handes murdered as good as a hundred persons. And if so bee that this be true, it

seemes straunge vnto him, that suche preachers will accuse and rebuke the Pope of Rome, for a theefe, and raueni

                  g bloudhounde, and the Cardinals and Bishoppes for villaines and reprobates. In deede it were straunge. For it is vnsitte, that one Woolfe shoulde bite an other. They ought rather to be faithfull friendes together, and say according to the common prouerbe: Te ti, Te mi, Clawe me and I will clawe thee: or, Keepe my counsell, and I will keepe thine.
               Howebeit, Master Gentian will not say, or assure much thereof. For he saieth that he knoweth none such: wherein, as an honest man, he doeth acknowledge his faulte in time, least he might be taken for a brother of that companie. Therefore, although he saith that the common brute goeth, that there are some Huguenote Preachers whiche are little better than those whiche stande by the high way side, Fellons, and rauishers of virgins: yet he soone letteth slippe his purpose, and doth leaue them for such as they are. He feares perhappes, that he might come to nigh the holie sea

reporte, but the verie truth, which euerie one may see and feele, That whensoeuer suche fellowes are wanting, which might fittely serue to furnish a Gallie, they are not to be found in anie place more readie, than at Rome. For, according to the glosse which is written vpon the decrees, Rome was first founded and built by Rouers and Fellones,

                  and doth yet obserue her auncient customes. Wherefore it is called in Latine Roma, as though one shoulde say▪ Rodens manus, that is gnawing the handes. Like as the saide glosse doth testifie in the decrees, with this following verse:

                     Roma manus rodit,
                     Quos rodere non valet, odit.
                  
               
               That is to say:

                     Rome gnawes the flesh,
                     from th'andes of euerie one:
                     And hates all those,
                     of whom she can haue none.
                  
               
               Which being considered by the good & worthie king Alphonsus, he was wont to say: That the greedie, rauening, birdes, (called by the Poetes) Harpies, did not nestle or dwell anie longer in the Islandes▪ but were remoued to Rome,

and did possesse the Romishe Court. And too this purpose, in like maner, did Pope Adrian the 4. lament and complaine vpon, to Iohn. of Sarisburie, Bishoppe of Chartres, saying, that the Pope of Rome was rightlie named, Seruus seruorum, that is, A slaue of slaues, forsomuch as he was a seruant and slaue of the Romanes, which are the verie slaues and seruantes of couetousnesse.This writeth Iohn of Salisburie himselfe in his booke, called Speculum or the Mirrour. In cap. quotiens. 1.4.7. Like as the Glose doth also testifie, in this common verse:

                     Seruierant tibi, Roma,
                     prius Domini Dominorum:
                     Seruorum serui
                     nunc tibi sunt Domini.
                  
               
               That is to say:

                     O Rome in time past,
                     Lords of Lords were thy vassals:
                     But nowe at the last,
                     Slaues of slaues and ranke rascals
                     Are Lords ouer thee,
                     As all people see.
                  
               
               Yea, he said further, That the Pope of Rome was no more a follower of Peter, but of Romulus: which Romulus, in the time, when the citie walles were a building, did murder his owne naturall brother called Remus: And within a small

while after, did perforce rauish the wiues and yong virgins of his neighbours the Sabines, vnder pretence of keeping a speciall day of solemnization. Insomuch as the citie of Rome is meerlie founded, sanctified, and hallowed, with murder riot; and rauishing of women. And therefore, it is no maruell, though such birdes keepe their feastes there, and are so welcome into it.

There do men fetch dispensations for all sinnes and incontinent liuing: like as may expressely be seene in the Taxa Poenitentiaria. There do they buy and sell holy and vnholie women and men, sonnes and daughters, soule and bodie, Bulles and Pardons, Benefices and Venefices: yea God and the Diuell, S. Peter and Saint Paule, and all thinges whatsoeuer, are there to sell. Yea the towne it selfe would be solde, so far forth as a merchant might be found, who had monie ynough: like as sixteene or seuenteene hundreth yeres ago, was prophesied by one named Iugurtha.

Like as the aforenamed Monke Baptista Mantuanus him selfe hath testified, writing thus:

                     Viuere qui sancte cupitis,
                     Discedite Roma:

                     Non licet esse pium.
                  
               
               That is to say:

                     All you, which desire
                     to liue in holinesse,
                     From Rome must retire,
                     the sinke of sinfulnesse:
                     Where all things are free,
                     for euery man to vse:
                     Saue godlie to bee,
                     which all men must refuse.
                  
               
               Behold, for this cause was maister Gentian well and wiselie aduised, and would not reason to farre in these matters, fearing least he might haue touched the Citie of Rome to nigh▪ forsomuch as eache doeth sufficientlie knowe, that the thrift and staple (of those things which hee did burthen the Heretikes withall) is in the citie of Rome, yea in the Court and Palace of the holie father the Pope.

                     Such as in thee dwell,
                     all goodnesse quite forsakes.
                     
                        A rare and straunge worldes wonder,
                     thou wilt of all be thought,
                     If Sathan keepe thee vnder,
                     and Christ set thee at nought.
                  
               
               Item:

                     O neast of diuelish treason,
                     from whence all vices issue:
                     O enimie to reason,
                     O fatall foe to vertue:
                     O drudge to drowzie dronknesse,
                     and surfetting excesse:
                     O shrowde of shifters shamelesse,
                     as whoores, and such like ghesse, &c.
                  
               
               To the contrarie hereof, these Hereticall and Huguenote Preachers, like as they are sworne enimies to the holie Romish religion, so in like maner do they hate and persecute the auncient Romish orders and worthie traditions: especiallie in that thrise accursed citie of Geneua, they are such terrible enimies to our Romish practises and worthie feates, that if anie dare once presume there with women, to practise the Romish, Gomorrian, or Clementine manner, hee should first bee made a Cardinal with a redde hatte vppon his head: or a Bishop at Tyborne, where he

might giue his benediction with his heeles: and his Mantle or Bishoppes cloake would not stand him in thirtie thousand Ducates, like as the Mantles do at Rome.
               
               Therefore, if maister Gentian his case be not cleare, as it is to bee doubted of one so faithfull a subiect of the holie Romishe Church, but that he is somewhat tainted with the Romish holinesse: I would by anie meanes aduise him to visit these newe founde Preachers, or to tast of the Huguenotes reformation or mortification. Although it seeme by his writing, that hee would gladlie knowe howe the matter is wrought amongest them: but if hee bee wise, he will keepe him thence, and beare aloofe from them, for it might breed a scab, and cause all the veines in his bodie to repent his enterprise. For their mortification is to the Romish beleeuing Christians, such a bitter receipte and lothsome pill, that it would goe neere to make them burst. If maister Gentianus bee well in his wittes, hee will packe thence, and rather trudge to Rome to his father the Pope, to holde with the mortification of the holie Churche of Rome.
               
                  For our deare mother is so kinde, that she gladlie receiueth all commers into her lappe, according to the expresse text of the Prophet Ezechiel,Ezech. 16.25. to wit, The daughter of Israel hath laid open her legges, for euerie one which passeth by her: and receiueth euerie one, Lutheranes and Huguenotes onelie excepted. And further prouided▪ that the taxations and rates of the Apostolical Penance parlour, be allowed, in token of an vpright penance. As namelie: Whosoeuer hath layen with his mother or sister, the said shall for foure pounde Turnois, be remitted.
               
               
                  But whosoeuer, besides this, haue committed aduoutrie with her, to wit, shee hauing a husbande, then must hee paye six pound.
               
               
                  Whosoeuer is accused and founde guiltie of Simonie, shalbe forced to paie, fiue and thirtie poundes Turnoys.
               
               
                  But whosoeuer hath slaine father or mother, sister or brother▪ the saide shall scape scotfree with foure poundes, one Ducate, and six Carlines: and so of all other. Vnderstoode alwayes, that this valuation is ment and taketh hold, so long as the Romish Court is resident on this

side the mountaines, namely in France: For if she haue her habitation, on the other side the hilles, as in Italie, then for poundes and pence Turnois, shalbe reckoned pounds and pence stearling: like as the Iurist or Lawier Ludouicus Gornesius hath written, and mencioned.

               In summe, they can not commit anie so great a faulte, but they may at Rome for a peece of monie, haue dispensation for it, & so scape free without blame or punishmēt, insomuch as they shall neuer come in Purgatorie, if they can keepe themselues from hell mouth: Whereas maister Gentian shalbe more welcome a great deale, than at Geneua, or elsewhere amongst the Huguenote Preachers. And this worthie Booke or Epistle which hee hath made, may serue him verie well at Rome, for a speciall recommendation to the holie Father the Pope, for to obteine him a Bisshops Myter, or a Cardinals hat.
            
            
               The vii. Chapter: VVherein is giuen to Maister Gentian and all other holie Catholikes, good and wholesome counsell: And thus the booke concluded.
               BVt aboue all things in the worlde, I would wish master Gentian, to be perswaded

to remaine stedfastlie, and sticke close to the olde customes and traditions of his predecessors, like durte to a carte wheele, and he can not speede amisse: For although he bee then a good fellow wt the rest, or an Aleknight, or one which loues the companie of pretie wenches: yet so long as he is not an heretique, it makes no matter: hee needes but once in a yeare to go to shrifte, and obserue a highe feast daye, and then shall he be taken for a good & faithfull subiect of the holie Catholike Church. And admitte that after his deathe he should passe to Purgatorie: yet shall so many Masses (which nowe are fallen in price and become good cheape) be said for his soule, that he with hose and shooes, shal flie to heauen, as straight as a sickle.
               Therefore must I greatlie maruell and reioyce at his wise, deliberate, and wellpremised conclusion, which hereto hee hath annexed, to witte: That hee will remaine permanent in the lappe of his dearlie beloued mother the holie Churche of Rome, without medling or hauing ought to doe with the Heretikes.
               For seeing they cannot (as he saith) he

faithfull, forsomuch as they will not beleeue all whatsoeuer the holie Church doth beleeue: and in especiall will not beleeue the holie Sacrament of the Altar. Seeing also it is a lie, that we ought not to beleeue anie thing, but whatsoeuer God comprehendeth in the Scriptures, and that we may not adde or diminishe anie parte thereof: and that in like case the Scripture doeth holde on our side, beeing rightlie taken and vnderstoode, after the exposition of the holie Church. Seeing they doe also call vs worshippers of idols, like as also the Iewes do: seeing their liues be no better then good christians liues, and that they detest and deride al prayers, fastings, and mortification. Seeing their Preachers and Ministers may worthilie be reputed for ignorant and vnlearned: yea also reproched for lewde & wicked liuers: and that they canne bring vs no better demonstracions, nor alledge other reasons, than is in the Scripture: and that master Gentian euen vntill this verie time hath heard say, that there is no saluation without the Church: so will hee then liue and die with his deare & holie mother the Church:

and wil not at anie time forsake her, but vnmoueable remaine with her for euer. For although he with great hast did offer an answeare, and makes a shewe, as though he woulde runne in po
                     •
                  t haste to the Huguenotes sermons, yet he is not in earnest. I esteeme him to be so stedfast and obstinat, that he will not easily alter his hide, nor his spottes,Iere. 13.23. like as Ieremie doeth say of the blacke Moore and the Libarde. In the meane while notwithstanding, when I consider the merueilous burning zeale, wherwith he is driuen, then am I of meere necessitie forced, in the name of the holie Church, to beseech God, that the Huguenotes do not answeare him, but may find so much to doe with other hardie and waightie matters, that they doe not thinke on Maister Gentian, for feare least it might so fal out (which I hope not) that he might be chaunged, forsomuch as it seemes, that he is driuen with such seale to his saluation, that hee regardes neither Hedge nor ditch, but runnes so directly thitherwards, as a yong headelesse Ducke. Therefore had I rather request the Pope, to cast a morsell in his mouth, and giue him a good fatte benefice, to the ende he departe not

from vs in such haste: for it were to great a losse, if the holie Church shoulde misse such a strong pillar. They might go nigh to fall both in the ashes, which Gods good mother, and all the Saintes which are at Bruxelles on the high altar of S. Goele, deliuer vs from,S. Goele is the chiefe Church in Bruxe's, a citie so called. 
                  Per omnia secula seculorum, that is to say, For euer, Amen.
               Further, I am friendlie to request the good man, which did translate the Epistle of Gentian into the Dutch tongue, that he will take thus much paines more, for the commoditie of our deare mother the holie church, and to the reioycing of the foresaid good man maister Gentian, to translate this our exposition of his Epistle into the French tongue: to the end that the Wallons may in like manner vse this our Bee hiue, and gather the honie & honiecombe thereout, to the renoume, glorie, and honour of our mother the holie Church, against all her foes.
            
         
         
            
            The conclusion of this booke, to the Christian Reader.
            HEre hast thou (welbeloued Reader) a short exposition and declaration vpon the Epistle or letter of the most learned Doctour maister Gentian Haruet: which serueth not onelie thereto, but to all other bookes and writings of the Catholike writers, and defenders of the Romishe Seate. For we haue herein (as brieflie and expresselie as may be) rehearsed the two chiefest foundations, wheron all their Scriptures, reasons, conclusions, and Syllogismes, are founded and built, namelie:
            The first, The holie Catholike Church what shee is, whereon shee dependeth, and howe farre her authoritie and power doth streatche.
            And the second, namelie: The expositions of the Scripture: wherein eache may see with eyes, that howbeit the Huguenotes and Lutheranes do alwayes referre them to the text of the holy Scripture, yet our deare & louing mother the holy church

can so aptlie handle the said text, that shee maketh it so fitte and pliable, as it doeth wholie bende and stretche to her aduantage.
            Then reade the same, and accept our paines in good worth: and considering the grounded reasons of all commotions and insurrections, which from fourtie yeeres hitherwarde haue bene in Christendome, for causes of Religion and Gods seruice, pray vnto God, that he, for his Sonne Iesus Christ his sake, will shortlie appeare, & with the breath of his mouth, and force of his holie Spirit, consume and destroy the wicked wasters, and falsifiers of his holie worde and doctrine, to the glorie of his most holy name, and the edifying of his Church and Congregation.
            But seeing that here aboue in this our Bee hiue of the Romishe Churche, wee haue often and in sundrie places repeated, that with manie ragges and patches it is botcht and sowed togeather, and selected from diuers and sundrie sortes of flowres and herbes, to make the honnie sweete, wee will for thy delight and for the further declaration & confirmation of that whiche

is said, dilate and more amplie declare the condition and propertie, or rather commoditie of our Bee hiue, the original, disposition, nature, cunning, and capeable capacitie of our Bees, in their honie and honie combes, their rule and regimentes, with all things appertaining: to the end it may be knowen wherein they doe agree with our common sorte of Honie Bees, and in what respect they disagree & decline from them. In which treatie, we will presentlie followe with the description of Bees, which Aristotle in Greeke, Varro, Columella, Virgil and Plinie in Latine, haue wittilie written, and for our learning left behinde them. But because none shall thinke, that we will in anie respect be iniurious to the holie Romish Church, forsomuch as we compare her holinesse and vnmoueable foundation, to Bees, and a Bee hiue, I will first and before all other matters, rehearse the high prayse and commendation which shee her selfe doeth attribute vnto them. For beholde, these are the wordes which shee doeth vse vpon Easter eeuen, in the hallowing or sanctifying of her Easter Tapers.
            
               
               Cum igitur huius substantiae miramur exordium,
               In the Masse booke. 
               Apum necesse est laudemus originem: Apes vero sunt frugales in sumptibus, in procreatione castissimae, aedificāt cellulas cereo liquore fundatas, quib. humanae peritiae ars magistra non coaequatur: Legunt pedibus flores, & nullum damnum floribus inuenitur: partus non edunt, sed ore legentes concepti foetus reddunt examina, sicut exemplo mirabili Christus ore paterno processit. Foecunda est in his sine partu virginitas, quam vtique Dominus sequi dignatus, carnalem se matrē habere, virginitatis amore constituit. Talia igitur Domine digna sacris Altaribus tuis munera offeruntur, quibus te laetari Religio Christiana non ambigit, Per Christum Dominum nostrum, Amen.
            
            Which in our English tongue is to say:
            
               Forsomuch as we doe maruellouslie wonder,
               Commendation or praise of Bees. 
               in considering the first beginning of this substance, to wit, waxe tapers, then must we of necessitie greatlie commend the originall of Bees: for they are sober in diet, & exceeding chast in engendring. They make closettes, &

found them on the souple waxe, whervnto mans▪ inuention and knowledge is not to bee compared: they gather of the flowres with their feet, and yet the flowres are not endamaged by it: they bring foorth no yong ones, but deliuer their yong swarmes through their mouthes, like as Christ (for a wonderfull example) is proceeded from his Fathers mouth: they haue a fertile chastitie without bearing, which example Christ hath thought good to followe, and ordeined to haue a carnall mother, for loue of chastitie. Therefore, O Lord, are such worthie giftes offered and presented vpon thine Altar, wherein Christian Religion is assured that thou delightest exceedinglie: through our Lord Iesus Christ, Amen.
            
            Beholde, here wee perceiue, what a precious iewell these Bees are. Wherefore our deare and louing mother the holie Church of Rome, ought not to scorne or disdaine, that wee doe compare her customes and orders to a Bee hiue, considering that she her selfe doth compare the incomprehensible generation of the sonne of GOD from his Father, together with

his birth, out of the pure and vndefiled Virgine Marie vnto the Bees: whiche were in verie deede a great blasphemie, if the Bees were not of so great valour and vertue, that by them wee might liken and compare the holie Church of Rome. And seeing shee saieth, That GOD is delighted with the giftes and presentes of the Bees, why should not shee her selfe exceedinglie reioyce with our Bee hiue? Therefore can none blame vs herein, vnlesse also they blame and accuse the holie Church of Rome for blasphemie. Which considered, we will without feare or dread, proceed with this our Bee hiue.
         
         
            
            Now followeth further the exposition & declaration of the Bee hiue, and the description of the Bees, the Honie and Honicombe, with all things belonging therevnto.

They commonlie call them at Louen, Sophismata, or Quotlibeta, and are founde for the most part by the Basketmakers of the Romish Church: namelie, by Iohannes Scotus, Thomas de Aquino, Albertus Magnus, and other such like, which haue bene verie expert and c

Here vnder you may also mingle some Iewes lime, or Bitumen, which is a verie tough and cleauing substance, wherewithall the citie and Towre of Babylon was wont to be bound and it is drawen out of the poole and dead sinke of Sodom and Gomorre: For herewithall thou shalt make such an excellent morter, that neither the heate of the Sunne, nor showres of raine, will bee of force to moisten it, or make it to splitte.

to haue it somewhat garishe to the eye, vse besides all the rest to make snowe white Gypsus, or a kinde of playster of white biblish Marble stone very finely grounde in a Louauist or Parisian mill, beeing wrought with excellent stronge durtie decrees, and so stroke ouer with a whiting brushe or pincell, and then painted with all manner of gallant pictures and braue images: for that makes a gaie shewe, and causeth the Bees the rather to enter into it.
            
            
               The ii. Chapter. Declaring the first originall of these Bees.
               COncerning the first original of Bees, are sundrie opinions amongest the learned. Some amongst the Poetes, as Higinius, and others saye, that there was a woman,
                     Melissa.
                   named Melissa, whome Iupiter did transforme into a Bee. And it seemeth partely, that our bees be of a feminate disposition. The other, as Euhemerus saith, that they are proceeded of hornettes and horseflies, which did norishe and feede Iupiter, being in a caue, in the lande of Creta, and that he (for that cause) did endue

them with honnie. Which fable therein doeth agree with the trueth, forsomuch as the idol Iupiter, and all other idols are nourished and mainteined with the hony of our bees, and by them brought acquainted in the worlde. Some suppose, they were firste founde in Thessalia, whiche is a verie fertile soile of all manner poisones, and sorcerers necessaries: the other say, in an Is
                     •
                  and named Quea: other some, vppon a mounteine Himettus. In sūme, what so euer it be, thus much is of it, that our Bees are exceeding olde: for Moses mentioneth, that in Aegypt were suche a sorte of Bees,Psal. 118.12. Esaie. 7.18. 
                  Dauid declareth also of a swarme of such Bees, which hadde enuironed him aboute. And Esaie speaketh of the Bees in in Assyria and Chaldea. Yet notwithstanding our Bees do somwhat differ from those. For these were firste bredde at Rome, in the dayes of Numa Pompilius, and continued many hundred yeares after, and are maruellous
                     •
                  ie increased: yet after that, the firste kinde beeing all most worne out, they are growen to an other kinde, in the dayes of Phocas the Emperour of Rome. But wee

will permitte this to the iudgements of Historiographers, and prosecute our matter.
            
            
               The iii. Chapter. Of the qualitie and sundrie sorts of Bees.
               Those Bees Ergo, are of sundrie qualities, but are in a manner all brought into two sortes or species,
                     Natural. hist. lib. 11. Cap. 18. Domesticall Bees. according to the description of Plinie. For the one are domesticall or house Bees, and bee conuersant among people. The other are strange and odde, terrible to see to, more teaslie or angrie, and with a sharper sting, but withall more diligent in their Beehiue. And albeit they are conuersant also amongest people, and frankly bestowe their honie, yet bee they more solitarie and straunger than the other, and therefore are called with the Greeke worde Monachi, that is to say, dwelling solitarie or by them selues and are knowen from other, by a hoode which they weare on their heads. Wee will tearme the first tame Bees: and these wilde Bees.Tame Bees. Wilde Bees.
               
               Furthermore, they are both diuided into

foure manner of sortes or kindes,4. sorts of Bees after the description of Aristotle and Columella. Of which, the verie best are thicke and round: they make the most honie,Thicke and sanguine coloured. & keepe companie next to their king, amongest which the most excellent are of a sanguine colour, as though they had redde scarlet winges. These tend the king, & are commonlie by his side, being of both kindes, wilde and tame: the other are of manifolde and sundrie sortes, with more varietie: but howe much the neerer they approche to the king, so much the thicker & rounder they commonlie growe.
               The second kinde or sort resemble and are like to Waspes, Horseflies, and Hornets:Like waspes. they make not so much honie as the first, because they come not of so good a kinde. Notwithstanding, they labour earnestlie, and bring also much honie into the Hiue. They are in a manner of the condition and nature of Horseflies & Hornets, sauing that they loue not so well to flie and seize on horses and kine, as they doe on sheepe. Wherin they digresse cleane from the nature of the ordinarie Honiebees, which do carefullie shunne the sheepe, for

feare, lest they should intangle them selues, and sticke in their fleeces. But these haue a good remedie for that, for they first bite away their wooll after that their skinne, & lastely do sucke their bloude, to which they are wonderfullie addicted: and therefore (of many) are called bitesheepe, or for breuities sake, Bishoppes. There are also amongst these, which are as profitable in the Beehiue, as any other, by reason of their fearcenesse, for they haue verie fearce and murthering stinges, insomuch as those being stoung by them, canne hardely escape death. For the wound can not bee remedied with any thing, but with golden salue: they are of the generation of Wasps, which Aristotle and Plinie do name in Greeke Ichneumones, which may bee interpreted Inquisitors, or after the Latine phrase Inquisitores, and after the saying of Plinie are so called, because with greate industrie and diligence, they know to seeke and catch the flies, and bite off their heades, permitting them to liue of that which remaines: howebeit, these our Ichneumones do moste couet the woll and bloud of sheepe, and are maruellous bloudethirstie. They are like wise of both

kindes, some tame, some wilde: But the wilde are alwaies more fearce and deadly. They are bredde or ingendred, after the same order, which Aristotle doeth declare of his Ichneumones: namely, they take verie venimous spiders, named Phalangiae, (which are found plētifullie in Spaine at the olde Inquisitors walles and postes) and carrie those to their holes: and after they haue greased them a good with filthe and durte (wherevnto ours vse commonly Popes grease) then do they set or broode ouer them, and after that sorte increase their kinde.
               The thirde sorte is by Arlem named Pheres,
                  
                     Pheres.
                   which signifies as much as theues and rouers, because they are of an exceeding theeuish disposition, and haue a great large and broade belly commonly blacke to see to. These deuoure greate store of honnie, and loue exceedingly well the smacke of Prebends and fatte beneficed honie, whiche the Bee Apothecaries do tearme in Latine Veneficia: And therefore are called Veneficiati, or veneficed. They are for the most parte tame, yet there are founde not a fewe, which are of the wilde and straunge disposition.

And they are separated amongest themselues, each ouer a seuerall office & charge, according as the king hath appointed them. For some haue nothing else to doe, but with an irksome buzing by day and night do swarme in their hiue. But they knowe their rule, how and when they shall swarme, and are for that cause called Regulares, or by a Greeke worde Canonici. Some are appointed eache ouer his honicombe apart, which they call Parishes, by reason whereof they are called Parishe Priests. The other are as Presidents in the conuocation house, & haue eache about ten Bees vnder their iurisdiction, whereof they are called in Greeke Decani: which in our tongue doth signifie the tenth men, or Capteines ouer ten.
               Touching the wilde sorte of Bees, some are called fathers, or wt a Chaldean word Abbas, because they beare rule ouer the other Bees, like a father ouer his children. Some keepers, or after the Italian and French phrase, Gardians. Some are called the first, or in Latine Priores. Some Controllers, or in Latine Prouinciales: eache after his state and calling, & according to the rule and dominion which

he beareth ouer the other common Bees, which common Bees make the fourth and last heape or kinde of Bees, according to Aristotles declaration, and are named in Greeke Cephenes, and in Latine Fungi, that is after our language, Buzzardes or Drones. These are the most vnprofitable Bees, and yet the most in number: they haue no sting, and will not worke, but liue on the labour of the other, and chieflie the wilde Bees, amongst the which some flie swarming from doore to doore, to finde out baightes to fill their bagges: and therefore are called Mendicantes, that is to say, Beggers, or begging bees: because they are of the begging order of Bees. But the tame Drones do not flie so from house to house, but tarrie in their Bee hiue, & there get their commons with swarming, without labouring, or doing anie good. For when they would doe anie good, then doe they commonlie misse, and are also for that cause called Missebees, or Massebees.
               And these are the foure chiefest sortes & kindes of our Bees, agreeing verie fitlie with the descriptions of Aristotle & Plinie. For touching certein wormes (wherof they

mention) the which do growe in the Bee hiue, & are termed by them with a Greek woord named Cleros▪
                   and hath no other name in Latine then Clerus, that is no seuerall or speciall sorte of Bees, but is a general name of all the Bees, when they first come forth: like as Plinie in the 16. chap. of the 11. booke hath written. For he saith, that whensoeuer the Bees come not to perfection, but remaine still wormes, then are they called Clerus, which falles out in like order with our Bees: for amongest them are none called Clerici, but those whiche beginne to fledge, and haue a white spot on their heads, which seemes to bee a white worme, as Plinie saieth. And if so be it, they remaine still in that state, without cō
                  ming to further order or degree of Bees▪ then are they esteemed and accounted as of an vnperfect creation, and haue no other name but Clerici, and the white spot which they beare on their heads, Tonsura Clericalis.
               
            
            
               The iiii. Chapter. Of the nature of Bees: of their ingendring, and procreation.
               FVrther, concerning the nature of these Bees, there is a difference betwixt

male and female, especiallie amongest the wilde. And they loue to go together, yet do they not ingender the one of the other, but be most altogether ingendred & made of their king, like as Aristotle and Plinie doe plainlie shewe: for without this king, they can not bring foorth their like, notwithstanding they can brood vp these foresaid wormes, named Clerus, after they haue bene first ingendred by the king: if Plinie be credible, in the sixteenth Chapter of the forenamed booke of his Historie.
            
            
               The V. Chapter. VVhat the rule and beeing of these Bees are, touching their King.
               IN their rule they resemble the common sorte of Honie bees, for they haue all one king: yea can not abide without a king, whom they call Papa, as if one should say,
                     Papa pate
                           •
                         Apum.
                   
                  Pater Apum, that is to say, The father of Bees, whereof it commeth, that we call al these Bees in the Dutch tongue Papen, & with vs, Papisticall Priestes. For the Bees are called in Latine Apes.
               
               This king hath a sting in like maner, but

he doeth not occupie him selfe abroad, because al other Bees are prest to do him seruice, in whatsoeuer it pleaseth him to commaund. And like as this king of Honiebees hath a spot on his head: so likewise doeth he carrie a token or marke on his head, like a triple crowne: howbeit, all the other Bees (as hath bene said) do beare in like maner a round white spot in the middle of their heades, in manner of a crownet. They flie all at once about this king, and shewe themselues verie meeke and obedient towards him. Hee goeth seldome abroad, but when he doeth determine to go forth any whither, it may be perceiued lōg before, by the swarming and humming of the forerunners. For whensoeuer he goeth out, the whole swarme followeth round about him, and oftentimes they carrie him on their shoulders, like as the honie Bees doe carrie their king.
               He hath likewise certeine loiterers by him, and Seruitours which garde him, and some other of the verie best, which bee of a ruddie or sanguine colour, & remaine alwayes next to his side, and are for that cause named Laterales, or a Latere.
                  
In summe, each one would faine be next: for that is reputed for great honour: where he settles, there is the host of the whole swarme and staple of the honnie and honnie combe: and such as dwell many hundreth miles thence, bend notwithstanding their flght thitherwards: who so euer hath him to friend, shall in like manner finde friendshippe of all the whole swarme: when they lose him, then is all their porridge spilte, and sporte at an end: For they creepe pensiuelie to their selles and closets, and there buzze or swarme so longe and so much, till they haue gotten an other. And if by mishappe it chaunceth, that there bee twoe or three kings, (like as hath often hath bin seene,) then falles out great schismes and troubles among them, and they bee at mortall warres together: yea, cease not, till the one or the other bee dispatcht & made away: like as Virgil hath finely set forth.

               THey obserue their burialles verie carefullie, like as also the common

honnie bees do, and make a great hūming, whensoeuer they carrie anie of the Bees forth. With the sound of hallowed beiles & pannes, they are greatlie to be comforted: for with such tinging they are well holpe vp & amended, and then they gather toge-in their bee hiue wt a great buzzing. But especiallie they are to be cōforted whē they are pēsiue & ill at ease,
                     Argentina and Nummularia are phrases alluded to coyne or gold & siluer. with a burnt incense of good herbes, to wit, Argentina & Nummularia: for that sente they loue a life, according to Virgils writing, who saith, The cōmon honiebees are well pleased wt burnt incense of Casia, Thymus, & other sweete smelling hearbes. They obserue their Vigiles like to other Bees: for there are some which rise in the night with a great humming, & swarme the one to the other, like as if they were singing Mattines or De profundis.

                     •
                  pter. How these Bees worke, and how they be mainteined.
               THese Bees in their labour resemble much the common sort of honiebees, for they cease also from worke in the winter time, & when it is foule weather. They intend not to labor, onles first the Beanes do bud, and hauing once begun, they cease

not so long as faire weather continueth, iust as Plinie doth write of the other bees. But herein they differ from the other, in that they cannot make anie freshe or newe honiecombes: but it must be made to their handes, by certeine other Apothecaries, which are skilfull in the same, & make the honiecombe after this sorte: They take two or three vnces of honiedeawe, whiche falleth from heauen vpon the Prophetical and Apostolicall beanes, & is commonlie called, Manna coeleste, or Drosomeli. It was wont to be found plentifullie in Calabria, but nowe it is also in Germanie, England, and Fraunce: yea also verie rife in the Base countries. But this may they not by name put rawe in the hiue: for it would cause the Bees to haue a laske, and would all die of it. Therefore do they hate this excedinglie: insomuch that where they are conuersant, this heauenlie deawe is scarse and harde to bee founde. Therefore the Apothecaries must first temper this honnie deawe in this order: They let it be molten first by a whote fire of Sophisticall seacoales, and after that they doe let it seethe more than the one halfe away, in a thicke and troubled muddie water,

which they haue drawen out of the Tiber at Rome,
                     Tiber, Sene, and Dilie, are riuers so called the Sene at Paris, or the Dilie at Louen: and beeing thus sodden, do still it in a clocke bell, or Doctors hood, so long and sufficient, till the naturall substance is cleane gonne, and that the Quinta essentia by them bee drawen from it.
               This Quinta essentia, they mingle with a plaster cake, which they make thus: Recipe halfe a pounde of blewe counsell, which let soke three dayes & three nightes in strong Romney or Bastard: or if you can not get Romney nor Bastard, then take of the best Vinum Theologicum, which is to bee got, or of that wine whiche the whore of Babylon was woont to giue kings and Princes to drinke. These councels thus soakte, and the stalkes and carnels pickt cleane away, you shall bruse or beate verie small in a Parisian morter, and ofter moysten them with strong Romishe durtie decres, straining it through a Spanish cloute, or an Inquisition bowlter, and mixt with a little driuell of the olde Teachers, and sturde together, you shall with waxe, wherewith the Bulles of Rome bee seald (so much as need requires) make it in a Plaister cake: which Plaister cake is

by the Apothecaries, named Pastillus, or Bolus fidei Romanae, and this cake a little besprinkeld and powred ouer with the forenamed Quinta essentia confected of the honnidewe, you shall set in the Beehiue. For this is the honnicombe, and the foundation wheron the Bees labour. If so bee it, you can not make the same, you shall finde it to bee soulde at Trent, for there haue these bees Apothecaries for the space of two or three yeares ben gathered a long time together, to make so much of this hō
                  ni combe, that it may suffice all the Bees in Europa, and is sould very good chepe. You may cause it to bee brought thence by the Pardoners, which commonly driue their Mules amongest the mountaines in Italie.
               
            
            
               The viii. Chapter. VVhich sheweth on what flowers and herbes these Bees labour and gather honnie.
               THese Bees do labour almost on all sortes of flowers and hearbes: but Plinie saieth that they cannot worke of one herbe, which is called in Latine Rumex, & in dutche Patience, which with vs is Patience, nether yet of an other, which he calleth Chenopodium, and with the Germaines,
                  
is called Swines death. To these two herbes, our Bees in like case haue no lust or desire: but aboue all, they hate twoo other hearbes, of which the one is called amongst the Apothecaries, Gratia Dei, or the Mercie of God: the other, Palma Christi. For whosoeuer dare presume to set these herbes by their hiue, they would all at once set vppon him, and kill him with their stinges. Therefore if any will keepe this Bee hiue, he must fence his gardē frō such hearbes: but he shal sowe and set these hearbes following, wherein they haue a singular delight, as namelie, Broade way, Cokoe flowres, Assecucombers, or wilde Cucombers, Dogges tongue, & Dogges ribbe, Calues snow
                     •
                  , Cats tayle, Wolues clawe, Goose grasse, Goats beard, Buckbeanes, Hogges grasse, Toades f
                     •
                  owres, Lybards clawes, Madde hearbe, Toggeworth, Pennie male and female, or Man and wife. And next to the Bee hiue, hee shall set Popes hearbe, Popes wodde, Dragons bloud, Seuen tyded hearbe, Monkes hoods, Foolish mathes, Romish morsels, or Diuels bit, Romish royles or rigges, (as it please you to tearme them) Wolues berries, Belflowres, and Caunterburie

tales. Also a litle further from the Bee hiue, whither commonlie they go to solace thē selues, shalbe Virgins markes, Maiden haire, Capillus Veneris: For therewithall they are wonderfullie pleased. Also, Pothearbe, and Cuppeberries: for these they oftentimes like better then Seuentyded hearbe or Popes hearbes, which groweth next their hiue. And if it fall out, that you haue the commoditie of a running water by it, or a faire ditche, that wilbe patte and fit their turnes maruelous well. And you shall set in it, the hearbes called Vmbelicus Veneris, and Restum Merionis, which in the Germane tongue is called Narren Kolben: and shalt not forget to haue neare about the Bee hiue, some beanes growing with their flowres. And further, if thou canst so bring it to passe, thou shalt place a Mill not farre from the same: for they flie willing about the Milles, because they resemble them in lightnesse and vnstabilitie.
            
            
               
               The ix. Chapter. Declaring the diseases of these Bees, and the remedies to the same.
               THese Bees in like manner are not without diseases, like vnto other common Honie bees, and are especiallie troubled with the laske of the purse, and with the monie dropsie: and then are they quite out of heart: therefore must their Hiue bee often perfumed and smoakt with the forenamed herbes, to witte, with Argentina Nummularia, Goldemaries, or Mariegoldes, golde flower, and other such like. The Apothecaries knowe also to make a syrrope, which is verie good against all their diseases, which is this: Recipe, A handfull of rootes of Seuen tide herbe, of Rattleflowers, Coggeworth, and Peniemale, and beate them with Diuels milke, and sprinkle or mingle the same with the Quinta essentia of foolishe mathes. And further, a bole of fine white wheat meale, with dogges greace made trimme and round, and that sodde together with crosse thornes, and crosse herbe, and with nine leaues of Alleluya, and that being done, steepe it, and let it soake in Vine syrrope,

and then hallowed with fiue fingred herbe: put to the same so much honie, vntil it wax a thicke syrrope. This syrrope is called of the Bee Apothecaries, Syrrupus Missaticus, which is verie good and costlie to bee laid in the Bee hiue. For if the Bees eate of the same in the morning fasting, they shal not die the same day, vntil their breath be gone from them. And if so be they happen to die, then shal they immediatlie passe to the Bee heauen. It might also by great mishappe fall out, that the whole generation of Bees might perish, like as in some Countries hath bene seene, as England and Scotland: for the auoyding of whiche inconuenience, Virgil giueth you good counsell, whom in anie case followe. Prouided alwayes, that you, in steade of a Calfe, may also take a Hogge or an Asse, and stoppe his mouth or nostrelles, like as Virgil doth write: howbeit, you neede not to kill him, but onlie strawe certen herbes vnder him of the most principal, which we haue named in the Bee hiue, to wit, Popes herbes, and Seuentide herbe, and let him lie a while on these foresaid hearbes, in hogges dongue, you shall perceiue a wonder:

for of this Asse or this Hog will rise a swarme of Bees. And thus dooing, you may mainteine the kinde.
            
            
               The x. Chapter. Of the waxe and honnie of these Bees.
               THe waxe which these Bees make, is called Bull waxe, being of great estimation and solde verie deare: yea, a great deale dearer, then his weight in golde: but it is exceeding forcible, for who so hath of this waxe, doubtles hath great preheminence: for in Lent he may eate fleshe without let or daunger of lawe, he may marrie and lie with whom he will: yea, although she weee his owne sister, without beeing reputed an Heretike for dooing the same. He is also defended from Purgatorie, as one which eateth mustard is free from the daunger of thunder. For it is said, That if anie with this waxe, did come before Lucifers gate, he should bee forced to deliuer three or foure soules out of Purgatorie, spite of his teeth: yet wel vnderstood▪ so far forth the wax do not melt through the heat of the fire: for there must stand vpon it, the perfect seale impressed with a ring called

                  Annulus piscatoris. Concerning the honnie, there are some coūtries in which no other is vsed then of these bees, & whereas it is greatly esteemed, to witte, aboue all, in Spaine. It was wont also to be much vsed in Germanie & Frāce, but is growen now out of request, & with many nothing regarded, like as it is also fallen out in the base countries: but the Spaniards haue of late brought whole ship lodings out of Spaine, whereby it is become more vsuall againe: yet by experience it is found, to be vnnaturall and vnholesome, yea verie hurtfull and poysonable to be eaten. For it is of the same operation,In the 21. boke of the natural historie, in the 13. Chap. which Plinie doeth mention, speaking of the poysonable honnie, and declaring that the same may bee knowne, by that it is not fast nor thicke, but of a ruddie colour and straunge sent, whiche strikes soone into the head, and prouoketh neesing: such as haue eaten it, do cast them selues downe to the grounde, and seeke to coole them selues, &c.
               This is the description wherewithall the nature and operation of our bees honnie, doeth fittely agree. For it is in like manner bloudie coloured, and waxeth neuer thike nor faste, but remayneth still

nature and operation of our Bees honnie, doeth fittlie agree. For it is in like manner bloudie coloured, and waxeth neuer thicke nor fast, but remaineth still vnstedfastlie floting. It hath also a maruellous strange sent, for it sauors very stronglie after the honnie combe, which is chefelie made of stinking Romishe Decrees and decretals, and perboild or sodden with foule stinking water. It strikes in like manner quicklie into the head, and prouokes not only neesing, but also beereaues one of his senses and vnderstanding. It is also exceeding heauie in weight, and burdensome, and therefore such as vse it, haue for the most parte a heauie stomach, as though a mill stone lay on their heart. It incenseth all the limmes and partes of the bodie with heate, and makes one as it were puft vp, and further makes one cholericke and angrie: yet remaine they still creeping and cralling on the ground, very loathe to looke vp towards heauen. They seeke still to coole them selues, and runne like madde men from one place to an other, and fling them selues vpon their knees, before woodden stockes & stones▪
                  
or brasen images, to finde some refreshing. But howe much more they trouble them selues herein, so much the more sicke and diseased they become both in heade and stomache. They raue sore, and are verie greedie after the foresaide syroppe, calle Syrupus Missaticus: but the more they vse of it, the more they swel with self-holines, so that they are like to burst: somtimes they wax faint hearted, & loose their courage, their eyes are darkened, their eares stopt vp, all their partes numme and astonied: and yet they are persuaded to be most strong and lustie, & to haue their senses at libertie, to vse their limmes, feeling, and vnderstanding. Wee finde some, which haue euen the like accidents or Symptomata, as though they were bitten of a madde dogge, hauing their bodies wholie bloudie and sanguine coloured. They are lothsome, and shunne the light: they haue an euerlasting payne, like a gnawing worme at their heart: they foame at the mouth: yea, they barke and blowe, and also bite those whome they meete, although it bee their owne father and mother, sister or brother, those onelie

excepted, whiche are troubled with the same disease: for to such they doe no hurte or dammage. Some of them runne a pilgrimage to Saint Heughe, or Saint Gole, or in like case to our Ladie at Halle: yea, they sticke not to runne to Italie, to our Ladie of Loretta, or to Spaigne to Montserrato, and to Compostille, and to Hierusalem, and to other places more, hoping to saide some refreshing of the Saintes, but all will not helpe them.

               THe onely remedie is, to make them caste all, whatsoeuer they haue receiued and taken in (but that will they hardly doe:) And after that▪ shall be ministred vnto them euery morning a Syroppe of the heauenly honnie deawe, whereof wee haue spoken before, wholy rawe and vnsedde. And after they haue vsed this a while, and that there boddie is well prepared and cleansed with the same, Then shall they receiue a drink of the sapp of Gratia Dei, And of Palma Christi: And so (with Gods

helpe) shall, by that meane come, to good health and perfection.
            
            
               The xii. Chapter. Declaring howe it is to bee taken, that which Aristotle writes, that the Bees dye, whensoeuer they are anointed with Oyle.
               TOuching the rest of that which might be said of the nature and propertie of Bees, I referre you to Aristotle, to Plinie or to Collumella. For our Bees doe in a manner agree wholie with theirs. Onely you are to note, that where as Aristotle & Plinie doe write of the other common honny Bees, that they dye, whensoeuer they are anointed wt oyle, that is to bee vnderstood, of a speciall kinde of oyle or grease, which is called holy or hallowed oyle. For when our Bees are anointed with the same, then are they queasie, and without doubt, do seldome recouer or rise againe: but touching the other oyle, they haue a singuler ioy in it: for they can not worke aright, or as they should do in the Beehiue, vnles they bee first greased with oyle. And whensoeuer you will raise the generation of an Asse, Calfe, or Hogge (as

was saide a little before,) then must you grease the same a good with oyle, or else it will take no effect. There is also made a certeine confect of Oyle, Salte, White Virgins waxe and spittle, wherewithall their heads bee smeared, before they come or are bredde to anie full perfection. And if they will not yet cotton, then are they greased againe with oyle: for therewithall are they formed and brought to a fashion, and when they come to be full growen Bees, then must they the thirde time bee salued againe with oyle, and therewithall they come to a full naturall and most perfect kinde.

            HErein I thought good to instruct thee, good reader, to the end thou mightest discerne the nature and propertie of these Bees, from the other common honnie Bees: and not to thinke, that in all respectes they agree, but differ in many. But whosoeuer hath any vnderstanding, will perfectly perceiue it of him selfe. Therefore will wee not trouble thee any longer, but make an end of this our Bee hiue: Each reade & consider, & specially ponder all the witnesses and allegations which are alledged herein, as well out of the Scripture, as other Bookes, I trust he shall reape commoditie by it. God the Lorde lighten all our hearts with his holy spirit, and keepe vs from all errours, through his euerlasting trueth, wisdome, and Sonne Iesus Christ, to whom belongeth all praise, honor and glorie, with the Father, in the vnitie of the holy Ghost.
