            TO THE REVEREND AND GODLY BRETHREN, The PASTORS, and MINISTERS of the Church of SCOTLAND.
            
               AS in our Church (blessed be God,) touching the truth of Doctrine, there is no controuersie, so there is no doubt (deare brethren) but in the controuerted points of Policie, wee would soone agree, if wee did consider what is the power of the Church in these matters, the extent of her power, and the obedience that is due thereto: therefore concerning these,

I haue thought mee
                  •
                to vse this short Preface vnto you.
            
               The power of the Church.Albeit all things necessarie to the worship of God, and mans saluation, bee eyther expressely, or by necessarie consequence, contayned in the written Word, yet the particular circumstances of persons by whom, place where, time when, and of the forme and order how the worship and worke of the Ministrie should be performed, are neither expressely nor by necessarie consequence set downe in the Word: but for determination of these, some generall rules are giuen, according to the which the Church hath power to define whatsoeuer is most expedient to be obserued, and done for the honour of God,The power of the Christian Church in electing Pastors. and edification. This is a prerogatiue wherein the Christian Church differs from the Iewish Synagogue, as is manifest in euery one of the particulars aboue expressed. First, as touching the persons, in the Iewish Church, they who were imployed in the Ministrie, were particularly designed to bee Leuies Tribe:
                  Numb. cap 3. 1. Tim. 3. In the Christians Church neither Family, Nation, nor People, is separated for the worke of the Gospell, but the qualities, graces, and gifts of men meete for the sacred seruice, are onely set downe, and it is in the power of the Church to trie the persons particularly in whom these graces and gifts are, and accordingly to elect them. And albeit the function wherevnto they are called be diuine, yet the bounds within which, and the persons towards whom the same must be exercised, is limited by the Church, which hath diuided national Churches in Prouinces & Dioceses, and Dioceses in Parishes: so as both the election of Ministers, and the limitation of their jurisdiction, is from

the power of the Church. This the Apostle calls the measure of the Canon,2. Cor. 10. which God did measure out to him, beyond the which, he did not reach in his Apostleship: and such a rule, and measure should euery Pastor in the Church haue, beyond the which, hee ought not to passe, entering vpon other mens labour. As the Apostles had their measure distributed to them by God, so now euerie Pastor hath his bounds designed by the Church.
            Secondly, vnder the Law,Their power in c
                     •
                  nsecrating places. Act. 15.21. albeit the Iewish Church had libertie to build Synagogues for their ordinarie meetings on the Sabbath to prayer, and reading of the Law: yet the place, where the chiefe, and solemne worship of God was performed, was first the Tabernacle, and the Temple, both built by Gods owne speciall direction,
                  Deut. 12.4. and hauing the principall parts of his worshippe so appropriated to them, that in another place, the same might not be performed. But as vnder the Gospel men shall neither worship God in this mountaine (saies our Sauiour) nor in Ierusalem, but the true worshippers shall worship him in truth and spirit, the Christian Church hath power according to that Apostolicall Rule,1. Cor. 14.40. Let all things be done decently, and in order, to make choice of a place conuenient, within the bounds of each Parish, for the meeting of the faithfull to performe all the points, and parts of Gods worship: and

               The power of the Church in appointing times to Gods worship. Leuit. 23.Thirdly, vnder the Law the chiefe parts of Gods worship were astricted to certaine set times, & festiuities, & lawfully could not be performed on other daies: but vnder the Gospel omnis dies Domini est, omnis hora, omne tēpus habile est diuino cultui, as Tertul. in his book de Baptismo witnesseth; and Esay prophecied in his 66.23. From one Sabbath to another, and from one New-moon to another shal all flesh appeare before me, saith the Lord. Thus the Apostles ceassed not to teach daily in the Temple,
                  Act. 5. Act. 19. & from house to house, the Doctrine of Christ. S. Paul taught in the Schoole of one Tyrannus for the space of 2. yeres daily, and as one of the Greeke Editions hath it, from the fifth houre to the tenth. On the Iewish Sabbath, which is our Saturday, he taught often in the Iewish Synagogues.
                  Act. 13.14. Epitom. de fide Catholica.
                And Epiphanius records, that Christians kept their conuentions on Wednesday, Friday, and Sonday, by Apostolical tradition, and example. S. Augustine affirmes, That in his time men receiued the Sacrament euerie day.
                  Epist. ad Ianuar. 118. Our owne Church, besides the Lords day, hath appointed other houres and times for diuine Seruice in great Townes, as houres for Morning and Euening Prayer euery day, for Preaching, and interpretation of Scripture, such other times as they hold to bee conuenient. Thus is it manifest, that the Church hath power to appoint other set times besides the Lords day, for his seruice, as wel by the liberty which God hath giuē to his Church to come, and worship before him euery day, as by the practise of the Apostolicall, and Primitiue Churches. Yea further, the Church hath power to appoint religious exercises, and certaine speciall parts of diuine Seruice

to be performed in the times, which shee thinkes most expedient for edification. So hath our Church bin accustomed to appoint particular Scriptures to be interpreted vpon the daies so called of Exercise; and by the first Booke of Discipline, euery Pastor is ordained to teach in his Congregation on the Sondaies at afternoones certaine heads of the Catechisme: Likewise to minister the Sacrament of the Communion vpon the first Sondaies of March, Iune, Septemb. & December. It was the custom of the Church of Geneua, in the daies of I. Caluin,
               
                  Caluin
                  ▪ 361. Epist.
                to celebrate that holy action vpon the day of the Natiuitie, which wee call Yule, and vpon Easter day which we call Pasche. The ground of this power is first, the abolishing of the New-moones, Festiual daies, and Sabbaths by the coming of our Sauiour, in whom the body of all these shadows is: and next, the libertie giuen by God to the Christian Church mentioned by Isaiah, as ye heard before. For as by the first we are freed from the bondage of the Law, and the obseruation of the set times therein prescribed; so by the second, all times are sanctified to the worship of God, in so farre, that the Christian Church may make choyce of any time in the weeke, any day in the moneth or yeere for their publique meetings to his worship. And as for the Lords Day, which hath succeeded to the Iewish Sabbath, albeit God hath cōmanded to sanctifie it by the publike exercise of religiō, yet neither is the whole publike worship nor any part of it appropriated to that time, but lawfully the same may be performed vpō any other conuenient day of the weeke, of the Moneth, or of the yere, as the Church shall think expedient. Vpon this ground Zanchius affirmed, Ecclesiae Christi liberū esse, quos velit praeter dominic. dies sibi sāctificādos deligere.
               
And by this warrant did the primitiue Church sanctifie these fiue anniuersarie dayes, of Christs Natiuitie, Passion, Resurrection, Ascension, and the Descent of the Holy Ghost. Where it is obiected, that it is onely proper to God to make holidayes, I answer. That it is onely proper to God, to make times, and places holy, by appropriating to them a diuine worship, which may not bee performed lawfully, but in these places, and on these times; such as the Tabernacle, and Temple, and the Iewish Festiuities vnder the Law were: for vnto them was appropriated by God a worship, which might not be performed on another day: and so these dayes did not only belong to the worship as meere circumstances, but were proper parts or points thereof, and could not bee omitted, without marring of the whole action. In which respect, these dayes were holier then other dayes, because a part of Gods worship consisted in obseruation of them. Such holy dayes the Church cannot make. But to make times and places holy by consecration of them to an holy vse, the Church hath power: for the dayes that she appoints are obserued only for order, and policie; and haue no relation to the worship performed on them, as any Rite or religious Ceremonie belonging necessarily to the integritie thereof. The Natiuitie of our Sauiour may bee remembred, and publike thankes giuen to God therefore vpon any other time as well, as vpon the twentie fiue of December; likewise the Passion, Ascension, and the rest of these benefits: yet wee remember them at certaine set-times, not because the times require such a worship, or the worship such a time to the integritie and

lawfulnesse thereof, but to the end the worship may be performed orderly once euery yeare, in euery place vpon one day, that all people, wheresoeuer they be, at home or abroad, may bee instructed, and admonished to prayse and magnifie the grace of God, and goodnesse of their Sauiour. Herein the reformed Churches differ from the Papists, who Iudaize in obseruation of those Festiuities, because they professe to obserue them, not for order only, but esteeme them to be sacratiores & sanctiores alijs diebus,

                      sanctorum, lib. 3. cap. 10. 
               & pars diuini cultus, which we doe not. For the Lords Day, it hath succeeded to the Sabbath, and is holy by diuine Institution, hauing for euidence and confirmation thereof, both a morall Precept, and the exemplarie practice of Christ, and his Apostles in Scripture. In the forth command, after the labour of six dayes, the seuenth is appointed to bee sanctified in memoriall of Gods rest from his six dayes worke; and the particular day, not being expressed in the command, was notified to the people either by the exemplary practice of Moses, and the Church in the Wildernesse, or by tradition of the Fathers going before, if so it be, that from the Creation that day was obserued. Now after the legall shaddowes are abolished, whereof the Iewish Sabbath was one, if any will demand what day must bee obserued in the Christian Church, wee answere, that questionlesse for the quotient of the number, the day cannot bee altered, which by the Law is appointed. Heauen and Earth shall perish, but one iot of the Law shall not perish. Our Sauiour came not to dissolue the Law, but to fulfill it. In the Law wee heare that God rested the seuenth Day, that he blessed and

sanctified it, and there is a libertie giuen to labour six dayes, but the seuenth is commanded to be kept holy: so howbeit the Iewish Sabbath which was the shaddow, be materially abolished as touching the particular Day, yet the Day commanded in the Law, formally must remayne, and euer be the seuenth after six dayes worke. But if yee will aske, seeing the seuenth Day in particular is not expressed in the Law, and that day which the Iewes obserued, is abolished by Christ, as the shaddow by the body, how the particular and materiall Day may bee knowne, that the Christian Church should obserue? Vnto this we answere, that the particular Day was demonstrated by our Sauiours Resurrection, and his Apparitions made thereon; by the Apostolicall practice and the perpetuall obseruation of the Church, euer since that time, of the Day which in Scripture is called the Lords Day, as that, which the Iewes obserued was called the Lords Sabbath; because as the one was appointed by the Lord, for a memoriall of his rest, after the Creation, so the other was instituted by the Lord for a memoriall of his Resurrection after the Redemption. For this wee must hold as a sure ground, whatsoeuer the Catholike Church hath obserued in all Ages, and is found in Scrip
                  •
               ure expresly to haue beene practised by Christ, and the Apostles (such as the sanctification of the Lords Day) the same most certainly was instituted by the Lord to bee obserued, and his practice in that is exemplar, and hath the strength of a particular precept. Hereby it is manifest, that the sanctification of the Lords Day is of diuine Institution, as well by reason of the diuine Precept, commanding the seuenth

Day in generall to bee obserued, as of the diuine practice of Christ, and the Apostles their specifying the Day, which hath the force of a particular diuine Precept. In respect whereof, the obseruation of this Day is a point of diuine Worship, and is holy, not by Ecclesiasticall Constitution, but by diuine Institution. Moreouer this Day is holy by appropriation of it to a certaine religious vse, whereunto no other Day can be applyed, namely, to bee a memoriall of the Lords rest after the Creation, and of his Resurrection after the Redemption: As also to be a signe of our sanctification here, and of our glorification hereafter, as is manifest by the words of the holy Ghost, Exod. 31.13. It shall be a signe betweene me and you, that I the Lord doe sanctifie you: and that of the fourth to the Hebrewes, A rest is left to the people of God, wherein we should studie to enter. For this wee must hold, that whatsoeuer vse vnder the Law, was proper to the Iewes Sabbath, wherein now vnder the Gospell both Iew and Gentile haue interest, remaynes yet proper to the Lords Day that succeeded thereto: And in that respect, this Day differs from all other Dayes being obserued not for policie and order only, but for diuine institution, and the religious vse whereunto it is appropriate, that is, to bee a memoriall, First of the Creation, as hath beene said, because after our sixe dayes worke, we rest on it, being the seuenth, as God did from the workes of the Creation: Secondly, of the Redemption, because on it the Lord arose, and perfected that worke: and thirdly, to be a signe of our sanctification, namely, that God, who hath chosen and sanctified vs to be his people, and whom we worship, is God the Creator,

who in sixe dayes created the World, and rested the seuenth; and God the Redeemer, who rose on this Day, and hauing abolished sinne, and death, did bring in righteousnesse, and life; and God the holy Ghost, by whose power hee did rise, and by whose power we hope also to be raised againe. Vnto this holy and religious vse, this Day is appropriated, whereunto no other Day besides can bee applyed. That to conclude, the Church hath power to appoint times, for the publike worship of God, and to appoint such a kind of worship, as shee thinketh most expedient to bee vsed on these times for edification; although shee hath no power to make the obseruation of any time, a point of Gods worship, or to appropriate thereto any part of his worship.
            Finally, to end this point of the power of the Church, when the people are conuened in the ordinarie place, and at the times appointed, the Scripture hath not set downe, whereat the Pastour should beginne, how hee should proceed, and wherewith hee should close vp this Seruice: as whether hee should beginne with singing of Psalmes, or praying, or reading, or preaching; and when hee prayes, with what petition he shall beginne, what he shall subioyne next, and so forth: what order he shall obserue in baptizing and celebration of the Supper, in Marriage, in censuring of notorious offenders by Excommunication, in Absolution: and to bee short, in all such other points of Doctrine, Discipline, and Diuine Seruice, there is nothing particularly prescribed. Although the substance of all be in the Word, yet the order, disposition, forme, and manner are left to be determined

by the Church. Many of which points, are of farre greater moment, then any of the Articles concluded at Perth.
            Thus much for the power of the Church. We come now to the extent of this power. It is certaine, that this power cannot reach to any thing essentiall or materiall in the worship of God: but to the decencie, and order only,The Church hath power to determine generall circumstances necessary for God
                     •
                   worship. which is to bee obserued for edification in the circumstances aboue specified; Let all things bee done decently, and in order, saith the Apostle. The things themselues that are to be done, are partly specified in that same Chapter where this rule is giuen, and in the word else-where, they are fully and particularly expressed, and not left to be prescribed according to the will and iudgement of the Church, but by this Precept a power is giuen only to the Church to prescribe the decent manner, forme, and order how they should be done. And so to determine the circumstances which are in the generall necessary to bee vsed in diuine worship, but not particularly defined in the Word. So by warrant of this Precept, the Church hath no power to forme new Articles of Faith, new Precepts of Obedience, new Petitions of Prayer, new Sacraments, or new Rites, and Ceremonies, such as Salt, Oyle, Spittle, Chrisme, Ashes, holy Water, Lights, and innumerable such other things; which cannot be reduced to any circumstances, that in the generall are of necessary vse: wherein the Church of Rome abusing her libertie, hath laid vpon the Christian Church a burthen of Rites no lesse intollerable then the Legall Ceremonies, yea, and haue imposed them to bee obserued, not onely as things belonging to policie, and

order, but as parts of diuine worship, which we of the reformed Church reiect, esteeming all that to bee will-worship, which men impose to be obserued, as necessarie points of the seruice of God, which himselfe hath ordayned in his Word.
            
               The Lawes that the Church makes in their matters are alterable.Further, because the Ceremonies and circumstances left to the determination of the Church, cannot alwayes be one and the same, by reason of the diuersity of Ages, Times, People, and Nations, touching them no constant Law can bee set downe, as is acknowledged in the one and twentieth Article of the Confession of our Faith confirmed by Parliament; but altered they may be, and altered they should be, when necessitie requires: In which case Charitie (sayes Caluine) can best iudge, what is most expedient, Hanc si moderatricem patiemur, salua erunt omnia.
            
            
               The obedience due to the Ordinances of the Church.The power of the Church being thus limited, it is without controuersie, that the Canons made by her touching the circumstances that in the generall are necessary for the worship of God, ought to bee obeyed so long as they stand vnchanged or abrogated: not because they contayne in them any substantiall or materiall part of Religion, or that they haue in them any diuine Authoritie, as the Commandements of God, which in conscience bind to obedience; but because in them an order is established tending to vnitie and peace, whereby confusion, scandall, and Schisme is eschewed: and because the power of the Church, whereby these Lawes are made, is the Ordinance of God, and confirmed by the authoritie of his Word, commanding vs to obey them that are set ouer vs in the Lord, the Canons of the Church must be obeyed,

for reuerence of the Ordinance and Commandement of God, which is the onely direct and immediate obiect of our conscience, and the religious band that tyes vs to the obedience of euery humane ordinance for conscience sake.
            But because many excuse their disobedience with a pretext of conscience, I will shortly set downe the rules of conscience, that by the Word of God we are obliged to follow in our actions.
            The first is, whatsoeuer is commanded, or forbidden in the Word expresly,The rules of Conscience. or by necessary consequence, ought to be obeyed. The next is, whatsoeuer is commanded or forbidden by the Lawes and Ordinances of our Superiours Ciuill or Ecclesiastique, the same, if it be not contrarie to Gods Word, should be obeyed, by reason of his expresse command;
Obey them that haue the rule ouer you, and submit your selues, Heb. 13. And againe, Submit your selfe to euery ordinance of man, for the Lords sake, 1. Pet. 2.13.
To this appertaynes lawfull customs hauing the force of a Law, where there is no written Law. Thirdly, touching things that are free, and are neither determined by Ciuill nor Ecclesiasticall Constitutions, we haue this rule: Let euery man stand fully perswaded, in his owne minde, that he may doe or omit that which hee intends, without the offence of God or his Neighbour, but hee that doubts is damned, for whatsoeuer is not of Faith, is sinne, Rom. 14. These are the rules of conscience set downe in the Word, concerning which it is to be obserued, that the first rule is absolute, and the second and third subiect to it. The Lawes of men and their opinions must be tryed, and iudged by the Law

of God; for as the Apostle sayes, 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               ,
                  Act. 5.29. that is, We must obey God rather then men. As for the priuate iudgement of euery mans conscience, it is subiect to both the two former rules. That the iudgement of our minde must giue place to Gods Law, no man doubts: And that it ought to giue place vnto Constitutions Ciuill or Ecclesiastical, no man should doubt, that knowes how God by his Word hath ordayned, that euery soule should be subiect to superiour powers. It may be obiected, What if wee doubt, whether the thing commanded in the law of man bee lawfull and expedient, may wee obey thus doubting, seeing the Apostle sayes, that Whatsoeuer is not of Faith is sinne? Vnto this the answer is easie; first, touching the lawfulnesse of that which is commanded in a Law, no man ought to doubt, except hee bee able to proue euidently that the Law is vnlawfull by the Law of God; which if hee doe, hee must follow the first rule, and rather obey God then men. Next, as for expedience, Rom. 14: The things committed to the iudgement of our conscience, and which according to our faith and perswasion wee ought to doe, or omit, are not things determined or concluded by any diuine or humane Constitution, but such things as are free and indifferent, which a man may freely elect or reiect, doe or leaue vndone, without transgression of any Law Diuine,In matters of expedience where a lawful Ordinance is set downe, the same ought to be the rule of our conscience. Ciuill, or Ecclesiasticall. In such things, the Apostle willeth euery man to follow that which hee thinks most expedient for edification, and eschuing of scandall. Where a man hath not a Law, his iudgement is the rule of his conscience; but where there is a Law, the Law must

be the rule. As for example, before that Apostolicall Canon that forbad to eate bloud, or strangled things, euery man might haue done that which in his conscience he thought most expedient, according to the circumstances of times, places, and persons. In presence of the Iewes hee might haue abstayned from these things, if in his heart hee thought it most expedient, for eschuing their offence: Contrariwise, in presence of conuerted Gentiles, he might haue eaten, if hee esteemed, that by his abstinence they would haue taken offence, and doubted of their Christian libertie; but after the making and publication of the Canon that inioyned abstinence, the same was to rule their consciences. And therefore, after that time, albeit a man had thought in his owne priuate iudgement, that to abstayne from these things was not expedient, because some by his abstinence might haue taken offence as before; yet in that case he ought not to haue eaten, because now the will of the Law, and not the iudgement of his owne mind, was the rule of his conscience. Neither was hee now to respect the scandall, because it was remoued by the Law: for, by obedience to a lawfull Ordinance no man giues scandall, and if any take offence, both the cause and occasion thereof is the peruersnesse onely of the person offended. Tertullian saith well, Res bona neminem offendit, nisi malam mentem, that is, A good thing (such as obedience) can offend no man, but an euill minde; which must bee reformed by good information, and not by disobedience, which confirmeth errour, and causes rebellion. Caluin in his 363. Epist. written to Oleuian, giues many reasons, wherefore the comfort

of the Sacrament ought not to be refused to the sicke in time of extremitie, and declares that in his owne iudgement, he thought it expedient not to refuse the same; yet he subioynes, Scis, frater, alium esse apud nos morem: fero, quia non est vtile contendere, that is, Yee know, Brother, wee haue another custome: I beare with it, because I thinke not good to make contention. Here Caluin preferreth the custome of Geneua to his owne iudgement, and will leaue that vndone which he thought expedient to be done, rather then by doing it, and infringing the custome of the Church, to make contention. What then, shall wee doe ill, that good may come of it? for is it not euill to omit that which we thinke expedient to bee done, and that ought not to be refused, to the end good may come of it, namely, peace preserued, and contention eschued? To this I answer, The euill which the Apostle forbids, is a thing simply vnlawfull in it selfe, and not that which in one respect may be expedient, and in another inexpedient: As to giue the Sacrament to the sicke is expedient for their comfort, but to giue it contrary to the order of the Church, is not expedient. In things of this nature, Ex duobus malis, minus eligendum est, that is, Of two euils the least must be chosen. It is euill to refuse the comfort of the Sacrament to the sicke, but it is worse to giue it against the custome of the Church, and make contention. I must therefore in this case choose the least euill, and not giue the Sacrament, because thereby the greater euill being eschued, the lesse ceasseth to bee euil, and becommeth good. It is doubtlesse an euill thing to cast our goods in the Sea, but it is worse to lose our

liues: Here the least euill is to bee chosen, for the eschuing the greater, and in that respect it ceasses to be euill. Thus the rule holds in all things of this quality, when that which is euill is not vnlawfull and vnhonest, but vnexpedient and vnprofitable. And so to returne, Caluine for this cause preferres the custome of Geneua, to his owne iudgement in a matter of expediencie: for it is euer more expedient to obey a Law, and keepe a lawfull Custome, then to doe a thing thought more expedient, if it cannot be done, but by an open breach of the Law: because thereby the Law must be brought in contempt, priuate opinion preferred to publike authoritie, and so confusion, contention and Schisme brought in; and order, peace, and vnitie shoot to the doore. To conclude, in matters of expediencie, where a Law is set downe, if wee make not the Law the rule of our obedience and conscience, but our owne priuate opinions and conceits, then must we with the Anabaptists disproue and condemne all sorts of Gouernment, and liue like lawlesse Libertines, euery man following his owne conceite; whereunto it is certaine the peruersenesse of our nature carryes vs, that is alwayes prone to rebellion, and therefore easily drawne thereto with any shew of reason, pretext of conscience and religion: which the Penner of this pestilent Pamphlet considering, intends with Lyes, Calumnies, Falshoods, craftie Cauillations, Threatnings and Terrours of Oathes, Promises, and Subscriptions, to deceiue the simple, stirre vp the Seditious, confirme the Rebellious, & to beare down the Truth, his Maiesties Authority, the Power of the Church, and all that loue Order & follow after peace.
            
               To obuiate this his seditious and malicious purpose, it was not onely expedient, but necessary, that this answere should bee made, which by the grace of God, shall giue such satisfaction to all good and vpright hearted men, as they shall preferre the iudgement, determination, and lawfull Constitutions of the Church, to the singularitie of their owne, and other priuate mens opinions; order to confusion, peace to contention, and vnitie to schisme: aswell for the feare of God, who hath giuen power to his Church to set downe Lawes for order, and decencie, and hath commanded vs to submit our selues thereto; as for obedience to the sacred will of our most gracious Souereigne, at whose instant and earnest desire these Articles being found lawfull were concluded, and are now commanded to bee practised. When Dauid would haue gone out against Absalon, hee was stayed by the people, who esteemed his life more worth then a thousand of theirs: So should euery good Christian esteeme of the loue and fauour of the Prince towards the Church. Salomon sayes, that the wrath of a King, is the Messenger of Death, and like to the roring of a Lion, which a Wiseman will pacifie, and not prouoke: and that his fauour is as the cloud of the latter raine, and as the dew vpon the grasse. The truth of this is manifest in the Stories of the Church: what comfort the fauour of Constantine the Great did giue to the Christian Church, may be seene by the barbarous and cruell persecutions of the Emperours that went before.
            The euils, troubles, and calamities that the Church of England endured in the dayes of Queene Marie,
               
declared what benefit they enioyed by King Edward her Predecessor, and Queene Elizabeth her Successor. The beastly crueltie, and massacres vsed in France vnder the Gouernment of the Predecessors of Henrie the Great, hath made manifest to the World, what wracke and misery the discontentment, and offence of Princes; and how great blessing and felicity their loue, and fauour produces to the Church of God within their Dominions. What need wee to goe further then the Scriptures for examples to this purpose? therein wee see, that as the Church decayed vnder wicked and idolatrous Gouernours, so did it euer reuiue, and flourish vnder religious and godly Kings. We stand much vpon the offence of people, and esteeme greatly of their fauour, wherein I will not say we doe euill; but should wee put their fauour and offence in ballance with the fauour, and offence of him whom God hath annointed and appointed to be the nursing Father of this Church? In whose loue we haue found by experience, and daily findes greater benefite and good for the aduancement of true Religion, then can bee expected from many thousands of our best Professors; let be at their hands, who in Religion like nothing well but contention, whereby they make their aduantage one way or other, as they are inclined, delighting to fish (as the Prouerbe is) in troubled waters.
            It is often obiected, that the chiefe cause of our yeelding at Perth to the fiue Articles, was the respect we had to the fauour of the Prince, and the feare of his wrath: against my selfe in particular it is falsly obiected by the penner of this Pamphlet, that I confessed, we had neither Reason, Scripture, nor Antiquitie

for them, yet to diuert the Kings wrath from the Church, yeelding was best. The truth is, at that time I spake only of kneeling at the receiuing of the Communion, and said no more then I haue set downe in print in that Treatise which I published for kneeling, in the last words of the first Section of the first Chapter, and in the first Section of the second Chapter at the beginning: this was, That neither Scripture, Antiquitie, nor Reason doe enforce any necessitie either for lying, sitting, standing, or kneeling at the Sacrament; and that all these gestures being indifferent, I held it most expedient to yeeld, and not to striue with our gracious Souereigne for a matter of that nature, repeating this Verse,

                  Cedere maiori virtutis fama secunda est:
                  Illa grauis palma est, quam minor hostis habet.
               
            
            This I said at that time, and so yet I thinke, that to eschue the Prince his offence, and to keep, confirme, and increase his loue and fauour towards the Gospell and the Church, was a respect and cause great enough wherefore we should haue yeelded vnto his Maiesties desire in matters indifferent; against the lawfulnesse whereof, nothing hath beene, or can bee obiected, which is not, and may not be easily answered. Against the expediencie, the feare of scandall was and is all that could be pretended; which if wee were peaceably disposed, might haue beene, and yet may be very easily remoued: and therefore such a feare ought neither to haue impedite our yeelding at that time, nor our obedience now. We are exhorted by the holy Ghost to feare God, and obey the King. Where obedience to

the Prince may stand with Gods feare, it ought to bee preferred by euery good Christian to all other respects, and especially by the Pastors of the Church, who should as lights goe before others both in doctrine, and example, chiefly, when peace and vnitie may bee procured and preserued in Gods house by our obedience.
            For vnitie, wee should bee ready to lay downe our liues, as well as for veritie, which Dionysius Bishop of Alexandria writing to Nouatus, affirmed, saying: Oportuerit etiam pati omnia, ne scinderetur Ecclesia Dei,
               
                  Euseb. Hist. Eccles. lib. 6. cap. 34. 
               & erat non inferior gloria sustinere martyrium pro eo, ne scindatur Ecclesia, quàm est illa, ne idolis immoletur. Immo secundum meam sententiam, maius hoc put
                     •
                   esse martyrium: ibi enim vnusquisque pro sua tantùm anima, in hoc verò, pro omni Ecclesia martyrium sustinet. That is to say; It behoued thee to haue suffered all things, that the Church of God should not haue been rent, & it had bin no lesse glorie to haue sustained martyrdome for this, that the Churches vnitie might haue beene preserued, then for refusing to sacrifice vnto Idols. Yea in my minde, this is a greater martyrdome: for in that euerie man suffereth for his owne soule onely, but here, hee suffers martyrdome for the whole Church. This was the iudgement of that holy Father. who esteemed it a glorious martyrdome to suffer for the vnitie of the Church. Contrariwise, the Donatists did glorie in this, that by their sufferings, they entertained Schisme and diuision, confirmed the hearts of the simple▪ and supe
                  •
               stitious, in their errours; acquired to themselues the renowne of Martyrs, and thereby brought vpon the Church the imputation of persecution.

To whom S. Augustine answers, That they complained most vniustly, that they were persecuted by the Church, because the Church was more heauily persecuted by them: and thereupon in the eleuenth Tractate vpon S. Iohn sayes, Albeit Ismael was cast out of his Fathers house, for Isackes sake, yet the Apostle calls not Isaack, but Ismael, the Persecutor. In his Booke intituled, De Vnitate Ecclesiae, against Petilian the Donatist, he writeth thus: Grauius persequitur filius patrem male viuendo, quam pater filium castigando: & grauius ancilla Saram persecuta est per iniquam superbiam, quàm eam Sara per debitam disciplinam: & grauius Dominum persequebantur propter quos dictum est, Zelus domus tuae commedit me, quàm ipse eos, cum eorum mensas euertit, & eos flagello de templo expulit: that is to say, The sonne persecutes the father more grieuously by his wicked liuing, then the father doth the sonne by inflicting due chastisement. And Agar the Hand-maid did persecute Sara her mistresse more spitefully, by her vndutifull pride, then Sara did her by vsing due discipline. And they of whom it was said, The zeale of thine house hath eaten mee vp, did persecute the Lord more cruelly, then hee did them while as he ouerthrew their Tables, and droue them out of the Temple with scourges. And a little before in that same place, he affirmes, that they were the persecutors of themselues by the Apostles words: Qui resistit potestati, Dei ordinationi resistit: qui autem resistunt, ipsi sibi iudicium acquirunt, that is, He that resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God, and they that resist draw punishment and iudgement vpon themselues: and often repeateth this sentence, Non poena,

sed causa facit martyrem, It is not the punishment, but the cause that maketh martyrdome. To resist a lawfull ordinance, is euill: to suffer contumeliously for disobedience is worse; but by disobedience and contumelious suffering to confirme People in their errours, and rend the bowels of the Church our cōmon Mother, is worst of all. These things, I shall beseech you Brethren to ponder; and the Lord giue vs all in meekenesse, and humilitie, to trie what veritie requires; and holding that fast, to keepe the vnitie of the Spirit in the band of peace. The God of veritie and peace knit vs together in his truth, by the Spirit of his Sonne Iesus Christ our Peace. AMEN.

            To the Reader.
            
               THou hast here, gentle and courteous Reader, a true and simple narration of the proceedings of the last generall Assembly kept at Perth, opposed to the false and lying Discourse made by the Libeller against the same; with an answer to his Nullities; the Oath, and Arguments propounded against the fiue Articles there concluded. These paines are chiefly taken for thy information, that thou mayest know the truth and vnderstand both the matter, and manner of proceeding in the said Assembly. Since that time, I heare they haue put the Pamphlet in Latine, and set forth other Libels full of impious and reproachfull lies against the principall men of our Church. These I haue not seene, and if I had, I would not haue deigned them any answer. For, when leauing the matter, they fall a rayling at the persons of men, that are their betters in all respects, they shew the weaknesse of their cause, & deserue nothing of wisemen, but contempt. This manner of doing is better replyed with the Pillorie, then otherwise. Wee know the eares of many are open to admit detractions, and he liues not, that is not hated by some, who will readily beleeue the most false things: yet, Wickednesse hath not so generally preuailed in the world, nor are we so vnknowne in it, as wee neede any of vs to feare their defamations. If thou, notwithstanding, doest think that such Libels require an answer, I aske thee, How

shall it be done? I know no way my selfe, but eyther to vse Apologies or recriminations. And this last were not difficile to doe: for though the Writer goeth namelesse, the Faction to whose pleasure he writes is knowne, and they that sport themselues with such libels, sending them from hand to hand, as matters of some worth. Their persons we could easily pay home, and repone true things vnto them in stead of forged, telling them no other matters, then haue beene tried, confessed, and publiquely acknowledged by those that are hottest in this businesse, of themselues: but these are the weapons of the vulgar, which we disdain to vse, & vltio haec, Christiano homini maxime indecora. As for Apologies, the Wise man saith, That they leaue suspitions in the Readers mind, & plures Sermones prouocant, & plurium: The best Apologie against calumnies, is, conuitiatores factis refellere. Luther, Caluine, Beza, the great lights of the reformed Church, and our owne Knox, had many foule aspersions cast vpon them whilest they liued; yet did they not faint in their course, nor do they now heare the worse for them, with posteritie. Fame is not at mans disposing: and if any amongst men haue power of it, in nostra manu est, as one speakes, bene vel secus audire. We therefore resting in the goodnesse of our cause and conscience, will keepe silence, and not vnderstand such things, passing little with the Apostle to be iudged of them, or of the day of man. He that iudges is the Lord, who will lighten things that are hidden in darkenesse, and make the counsells of the hearts manifest: And then shall euerie man haue praise of God. To his grace I commend thee for now and euer.
         
      
      
         
            
            AN ANSWER TO THE PREFACE DIRECTED TO THE READER.
            
               THE PAMPHLETER.
               
                  THE externall worship of God, and the gouernment of the Church (gentle and iudicious Reader) are like Hippocrates twins; they are sicke together; in health together; they liue together; they die, and dwine together.
            
            
               ANSWER.
               The externall worship of God, and the gouernement of the Church, are neuer matched in Scripture as one twin with another: But the gouernment whereby the order, decency, and puritie of the worship is preserued, is sometime compared to a Wall, or an Hedge; wherein breaches may be made, either by persecution of open enemies without, or by contention of seditious brethren within,

and thereby the beautie of the worship defaced: Thus for a time they may bee sicke, and dwine together, but they shall neuer die till the world be done; all the enemies of God shall perish, but this Kingdome shall endure for euer: In this they differ from Hippocrates twins: and herein standeth the consolation of the Church against her feares without, and troubles within.
            
            
               PP.
               As long as the gouernment of the Church of Scotland stood in integritie, as it was established by Lawes Ciuill and Ecclesiasticall, according to Gods Word, so long was the worship of God preserued in puritie.
            
            
               ANS.
               The gouernment of our Church established by Lawes Ciuill and Ecclesiasticall, according to Gods Word, standeth now, praysed be God, in as great integritie, and the worship of God in as great puritie as euer it did. Sed ructare licet cacostomacho, but a windy breast must haue leaue to belch:

                     Non nostri faciunt tua quod tibi tempora sordent, 
                     Sed faciunt mores, Caeciliane, tui.
                  
               
            
            
               PP.
               Since the former gouernment was altered, and the insolent domination of Prelates hath entered in by vnlawfull meanes amongst vs; Popish Rites, and superstitious Ceremonies haue followed, and are like to preuaile vniuersally.
            
            
               ANS.
               The former gouernment is not altered, that is, either corrupted or abolished, as you insinuate, but is perfited by accession of the ancient order, which hath beene euer in the House of God since the Apostolicall times, and was embraced at the reformation, in Anno 1560. and continued in our Church in the persons of Superintendents and Bishops, till the yeare of God 1581. after that time, it was borne downe, till the yeare of God 1598. then it

beganne to bee restored, and hath entred in amongst vs by the conclusions of generall Assemblies, and Acts of Parliament, which none but lawlesse Libertines will esteeme vnlawfull meanes; nor the function thereby established an insolent domination, but the licentious who delight in confusion, and detest order. The Rites and Ceremonies which haue followed, shall be better cleered by the grace of God from Superstition and Popery, then this Pamphlet of your
                     •
                   from Schisme and Heresie.
            
            
               PP.
               They haue verified in their persons their common tenent, No Ceremony, no Bishop.
               
            
            
               ANS.
               The tenent is true, for where there is no Ceremonie, there can be no externall worship of God, more then a bodie can bee without dimensions; and consequently where there is no Ceremony, there can be no Church, no Bishop, no Pastor.
            
            
               PP.
               The liberty granted to our Church to indict, and hold generall Assemblies from yeere to yeere, and oftener prore nata, was the chiefe bulwarke of our Discipline; this bulwarke was broken downe, to the end a more patent way might be made for their exaltation.
            
            
               ANS.
               So long as this liberty preserued the ancient Discipline, and Gouernment of the Primitiue and Reformed Church in the persons of Super-intendents and Bishops, it was a good bulwarke: but when it was licentiously abused, to ouerthrow that which it had formerly maintayned, and to stop the way whereby it might be lawfully restored againe, the licentious abuse was to be restrayned, and order taken, that it should not impede, but further the worke, for the which it was appointed.
            
            
               PP.
               When vote in Parliament (the Needle to draw in the

thred of Episcopall authoritie) was concluded to the great griefe of the sincerer sort, many protestations were made, that no alteration in Discipline or Diuine Seruice was intended.
            
            
               ANS.
               That the Church, which hath euer represented the third Estate of the Kingdome, was restored in the persons of Bishops, according to the fundamentall Lawes to haue vote in Parliament, could bee a griefe to none sincerely affected, either to the Weale of the Countrey or Church: and as protestations were made, that no alteration tending to corruption, either in Discipline or diuine Seruice was intended, so none hath followed, but such as tendeth to the confirmation and perfection of both.
            
            
               PP.
               Many cautions and limitations were made to bound the power of the Minister voter in Parliament.
            
            
               ANS.
               The limitations and cautions which were agreeable to reason, and might stand with the power of the person voter in Parliament according to Law, haue beene inuiolably obserued.
            
            
               PP.
               They were ordayned to bee countable to the generall Assemblies, for the manner of their entrie, and behauiour in this new Office; but like Bankrupts, not being able to render account, they laboured that no account should bee made at all: that is, that there should be no ordinary generall Assembly to take account.
            
            
               ANS.
               No man can bee lawfully ordayned to bee countable to these of his entry and behauiour in his Office, who professe themselues enemies to the Office it selfe: Such were the generall Assemblies, which ye call ordinary, consisting for the greatest part of the sincerer sort, to whose great griefe you say, the power to vote in Parliament was concluded: reason

therefore would, that to such a Iudicatory no account should haue beene rendered at all. Not because they were bankrupts, as you calumniously alledge, but for the professed enmity and iniquity of the Iudge; whereof his Maiesty hauing proofe before, when the ancient Gouernment of Bishops was abolished, did now prudently prouide, that no generall Assembly should be conuocate without his Highnesse speciall licence, lest thereby the restitution of that Gouernment intended by his Maiestie, and happily begun before his Maiesties preferment to the Crowne of England, might in his absence bee crossed and ouerthrowne; by the which prouidence of his Maiesties wisdome, that plot was preuented, and your purpose disappointed: Hinc illae lachrimae: and this is that causeth you to rage and raile.
            
            
               PP.
               Some few extraordinary Assemblies haue beene conuocated of late yeares at their pleasures, and for their purposes, and according to their deuice constituted as they thought good: wherein they procured, or rather extorted with terror, and authority a sort of preheminencie aboue their Brethren.
            
            
               ANS.
               If ye call these extraordinary Assemblies, which by his Maiesties License and Authoritie were conuocated, the Councell of Nice, and the most famous Councels of the Church, must bee counted extraordinary. And in these Assemblies no preheminence was granted to Bishops, but such as Bishops had euer in the Primitiue Church, and such as the Super-intendents, and Bishops had before in our owne reformed Church; which beeing lawfull in it selfe, needeth neither by authoritie to be procured, nor by terror extorted from godly, prudent, and peaceable Brethren.
            
            
               PP.
               They were Lords in Parliament, Councell, Session, Exchequer, Lords of Regalities, Lords of temporall Lands, Presenters to Benefices; Modifiers of Ministers stipends; grand

Commissioners in the high Commission; was it wonder then if so great Commanders, commanded the Assemblies constituted, as is said, and carued to themselues a spirituall Lorship? when, &c.
            
            
               ANS.
               The power, authoritie, and credit, which was expedient for the time to be in the persons of some Bishops, was neither imployed, nor needed to be imployed, to command these Assemblies, which were constituted of the most graue and godly brethren of the Church, who against Law and conscience would not haue beene commanded either by Prince, or Prelate. Neither in these Assemblies did they carue to themselues any spirituall Lordship, for they acknowledge no man to haue spirituall Lordship ouer the Church, but the man the Lord Iesus; him they preach the Lord, and themselues the Seruants of the Church for him.

               When their worthy brethren were banished, imprisoned, confined, or detayned at Court, that they might the more easily effectuate their purposes.
            
            
               ANS.
               Their worthy brethren I may truely say, were banished, imprisoned, confined, and detayned at Court sore against their wils: who wish that good brethren, then had beene, and now were lesse addicted to singularitie of opinion, and more inclined to the peace & vnity of the Church: And that they would put difference, betwixt indifferent things in Discipline, and doctrinall points; and consider that in the one we must stand for veritie, and in the other for expediencie, which changeth with times, places, and occasions: That the forme of gouernment meete for a Parochiall or Diocesian Church, such as Geneua or Berne, is not fit in all respects for the vniuersall or for a Nationall Church: That at the beginning of the reformation, sundrie circumstantiall Ceremonies were changed, or abolished for Superstition, which now tending to edification, and preseruation

of Gods worship from prophanenesse, and to make conformitie and vnitie, both with the Primitiue, and reformed Churches, may be lawfully and profitably receiued: That antiquity in such things, and vniuersall consent not repugnant to veritie, is farre to be preferred to new and recent conceits, and customes of priuate persons, and Churches. These things the Bishops would wish from their hearts had beene, and were better pondered by brethren; and that for such matters, wilfull contradiction, bitter contention, and disobedience had not brought them vnder the censure of the Lawes, and power of authoritie.

               They haue broken the caueats made with their owne consent, violated their promises, and haue sought preheminence both in Church and Common-wealth, with the ruine of others, and renting of their mothers belly.

Neither haue they sought preheminence in Church nor Common-wealth, but that which according to Lawes Ciuill and Ecclesiasticall, belongs to their Function. The restitution whereof, if they had not craued, they had beene Traytors both to the Church and Common-wealth; against the which some brethren standing out too contentiously, haue inuolued themselues in vnnecessary troubles, and haue pressed with you, to rent the belly of their Mother, the peace and vnitie of the Church with Schisme.

such a poysonable pen, that beginneth to fill vp the paper with such venemous words, calling the lawfull meeting of the Church, a pretended new Assembly; his brethren of the Ministery, Seducers, Temporizers, Swallowers vp of all abominations, or corruptions whatsoeuer; for whom wee answere:

                  , his Maiestie protesteth vpon his honour, that hee misliketh not generally all Preachers, or others, who like better of the single forme of policie in our Church, then of the many Ceremonies in the Church of England: and are perswaded that their Bishops smell of a Papall Supremacie; that the Surplice, the Cornercap, and such like are the outward badges of Popish errors; and that he doth equally loue and honour the Learned, and graue men of these opinions.

               PP.
               His Maiestie vseth this prouision, that where the Law is otherwise, they preasse by patience and wel-grounded reasons, either to perswade all the rest to like of their iudgement; or where they see better grounds on the other part, not to be ashamed peaceably to incline thereunto, laying aside all preoccupyed opinions.
            
            
               ANS.
               If yee approue this prouision, as yee seeme after to doe, seeing a Law standeth in our Church neither reduced, nor abrogated against your opinion: why is your patience turned into passion, & your wel-grounded reasons into vnreasonable raylings: And considering at the Assembly in Perth, the grounds whereupon the Law was made, were esteemed by the votes and iudgements of more then double your number, better then any answere, or reason brought on the contrary, why are yee ashamed peaceably to incline thereunto, laying aside all preoccupyed opinions?
            
            
               PP.
               Wee are able to prooue, that no Ecclesiasticall Law hath beene made in any free and formall Assembly for the alteration by-past, or presently intended either in Gouernment, or Ceremonies.
            
            
               ANS.
               What you are able to proue, we know not, but vntill the time the probation be made, and the Church which made the Lawes, being better informed alter or abrogate them, it it is the duty of euery good and peaceable Christian to giue obedience thereunto, except they bee manifestly damned in the Word as impious: for there can be no peace nor vnitie in a Church, where there is not a Conformitie obserued according to Lawes; for if one shall follow the Law, another his owne opinion contrary to the Law, and the third, some conceit different from both, what can follow but contention and confusion in the Church?
            
            
               
               PP.
               The ratification of ciuill Lawes alreadie made, or to bee made, cannot rectifie the Eccesiasticall, so long as we are able by good reason to impugne their authoritie; and to euince the vicious constitution, the informall, and vnlawfull proceedings of those Assemblies, where the said Ecclesiastical Lawes are said to haue beene made.
            
            
               ANS,
               That which is right needeth not to be rectified; such the Estates of Parliament haue found the Canons of the Church, which they haue ratified: but yet forsooth so long as you are able to impugne their authoritie, euince them to be vicious, informall, vnlawfull: So long neither can the authoritie of the Parliament, nor Church make them to haue force, but all must be suspended vpon your skill and learning to proue, and improue as you list. Whereof this smelleth, whether of plaine sincerity, or of Papall Supremacie, let the Reader consider.

               ANS.
               If no exception might bee made against the Law, what well grounded reason can be vsed to perswade the contrary? His Maiesties prouision, is as farre contrary to the permission here alledged by you, as light to darknes: for although his Maiestie wish these who are contrary minded to preasse by patience, and well grounded reasons to perswade all the rest to like of their iudgement, yet hee permitteth them not to perswade others to resist to the authoritie, to breake the Law of the Countrey to stirre vp Rebellion and Schisme, which you by this Pamphlet doe only intend; but by the contrary, willeth them in these words (which you purposely omit) To content themselues soberly and quietly with their owne opinions; not resisting to the authoritie, nor breaking the

Law of Countrey, neither aboue all, stirring any Rebellion or Schisme, &c. but to possesse their soules in peace. If such licence were granted, as you alledge, was giuen by his Maiesties prouision, there should neuer bee any setled order in Church or Common-wealth, a doore being opened to seditious spirits, to disturbe all with such perswasions, and disswasious as are vsed in this Pamphlet.

            A TRVE NARRATION OF THE PROCEEDINGS of the generall Assembly holden at Perth, and begun the 25. day of August 1618. Opposed to the Libeller his Discourse thereof, in the Pamphlet lately Published.
            
               TO the end the true causes of this meeting may be vnderstood, wee must draw the occasion thereof somewhat further off, then the Proclamation mentioned by the Libeller. So it is, That his Maiestie at his late beeing in this Kingdome, did propone to the Bishops, and principall Ministers, who were called to meete at S. Andrews for that effect, the tenth of Iuly 1617. the fiue Articles now concluded, desiring they might be receyued in this Church, and an alteration made of the other customes that obtained before in these points. This proposition was made by his Maiestie himselfe in the Chappell of the Castle, where then his Maiestie remained. Vpon the hearing whereof, humble petition was made by the Bishops and Ministers there assembled, that they should bee permitted to conferre amongst themselues, vpon the said proposition, before they gaue any answer. Which being graunted, they went, and met together

in the Session house of the Paroch Church, where after mature deliberation, it was concluded, they should put vp one common Supplication, to his Maiestie for libertie of a generall Assembly, to aduise and take conclusion in these poynts. It being signified vnto them at the same time by the Archbishop of S. Andrewes, that his Maiesty would take this for a shift, and not content with the Supplication, vnlesse assurance were giuen, that the same Articles, should be yeelded vnto, in the Assembly; Answer was made by the whole number, That howsoeuer, they could not preiudge themselues of their free voyces in an Assembly, by graunting the said Articles before-hand, considering they were matters in themselues lawfull, and of a nature indifferent; as they could not thinke but the whole Church would bee readie to giue his Maiestie satisfaction therein, so for themselues, they would doe what lay in them for passing the same. And this they all desired the said Archbishop in their names to answer. But hee denying to promise any thing in the behalfe of the Ministers, in regard of the seditious protestation, they had, against their promise, at least a number of them penned to be giuen in the next Parliament, Maister Patricke Galloway was by them desired to make the said answere, and concurre with the Bishops in the foresaid supplication for a generall Assembly.
            Thus, all returning to the saide Chappell, petition was made in humble forme to his Maiestie by the Archbishop in the name of the whole, That they might be permitted to meete in an Assembly, where the said Articles should receiue the answer, which was fit. His Maiestie replying, that hee could not suffer these Articles, which hee counted both lawfull and profitable for the Church, to bee cast in the deliberation of an Assembly, where by reason of the multitude, matters went often doubtfully, except he had assurance, the same should be yeelded vnto; answer was made, That howeuer they could not that were present, take on them to answere for the whole Church, yet because they did not conceiue

any of these Articles to contayne in them, matters vnlawfull, they hoped all good Ministers would shew themselues carefull to giue his Maiestie satisfaction, and should for their owne parts endeuour that the same should be done. This was promised by the Archbishop of Saint-Andrewes in name of all the Bishops, and by Master Patrick-Galloway in name of the Ministers, as was afore-agreed.
            Hereupon his Maiestie was pleased to condescend vpon the meeting of an Assembly at Saint-Andrewes, in the moneth of Nouember following, where the said Articles, being reasoned vpon at length, it was found by vniuersall consent, That they contayned in them nothing vnlawfull, but in respect the suddaine receiuing of them might giue offence to the weaker Professors, and encouragement to the enemies of Religion, it was thought meete to differ the taking of any conclusion, specially about the keeping of the Festiuall dayes, and kneeling at the Communion, vnto another Assembly; And all the Ministers commanded, like as they who were present for themselues promised, to informe their people and Congregations, aswell of the lawfulnesse of the things desired, as of the necessitie they had to receiue the same, because of his Maiesties resolution so to haue it; and by this meanes all offence being remoued, in the next Assembly matters might take an end with vniforme consent; in the meane time, lest his Maiestie should offend with this delay, his Maiesties Commissioners, and the Bishops were earnestly entreated by the said Assembly to signifie the true reasons of the present cōtinuation, & beseech the same to bee well interpreted, seeing no denyall of the Articles was intended, but a care on their parts to remoue all scruple and offence from amongst the people.
            This aduertizement being made, his Maiestie tooke the same so hardly, as forth-with he gaue commandement to the Bishops to obserue the dayes of Christmasse, Passion, Resurrection, &c. And to cause all the Ministers of their Dioceses to obserue the like, as also to alter the gesture of sitting

at the holy Communion, into that of kneeling, which the Article required. And to sequestrate the stipends of so many as should be found disobedient.
            It grieued all the honest and true-hearted Ministers to see his Maiesty so offended, and many repented the delay made in the last Assembly: and because there was one meane only left to giue satisfaction, to wit, That a new Assembly might be gathered to put end to the same; the Archbishop of Saint Andrewes was entreated to intercede with his Maiesty for a mitigation of the rigour intended against the Ministers, and liberty for a new Assembly, to finish that which remayned to be perfected. To this effect he dispatched his Seruant vnto Court with haste, writing in such humble sort as became, and for the purpose aboue-said; but receiued this Answere, That touching another Assembly his Maiesty would neuer condescend vnto the same, except better assurance were giuen of their reasonable conforming; therefore commanded him and the rest of the Bishops in their seuerall Synods, to vrge the receiuing of the said Articles, and as they should find them inclining, to aduertise; and for the sequestration of stipends, his Maiesty would be pleased to remit that rigor for the present, so as the Bishops by themselues in their Sees, with so many others as they could perswade, should put in practice the said Articles according to the Letter, formerly directed vnto them.
            This Answere being communicated vnto the Ministers of Edinburgh, and a great many others, that were attending at Edinburgh, for the setling of their Churches according to the Commission giuen in Parliament, they all aduised the Bishops to giue obedience in their own persons, and at their Synods, to labour the Ministers of their bounds in the best sort they could, to condescend vnto the Articles proponed.
            The Bishops resoluing to giue obedience, for his Maiesties better satisfaction, and freeing the Ministers of his conceiued wrath, agreed, after their Synods were ended, to meet at Edinburgh in May next; and as they should find by

report of the Ministers inclination to yeeld to the said Articles, to follow their Supplication about a new Assembly.
            According to which agreement, they hauing met at Edinburgh, and vnderstood thar in the Synods kept in the April before, the Ministers were disposed to giue obedience and satisfaction to his Maiestie: they by their Letters humbly entreated his Maiesties Licence, for the holding of an new Assembly, and obtayned the same; which they signified by their Letters to the Moderators of their seuerall exercises in the Countrey, willing them to elect and choose the most wise, learned and peaceable Ministers in their bounds, to be Commissionaries at the said Assembly.
            But contrary to this aduice and direction, certaine factious and vnruly Ministers, that haue loued alwayes to keepe stirres in the Church, and placed their glory in the opposing of his Maiesties lawfull desires, vsed all the diligence they could, where they had credit, to purchase Commission to themselues, and others that fauoured their opinions, for disturbing the said Assembly; and came thither at the day appointed in great numbers, & certaine hopes to haue carryed matters otherwise then was intēded; howbeit to little effect, as the successe of the said meeting manifested. Vpon these occasions the meeting was brought on; & not abruptly by a Proclamation, being made 20. daies before, as the Libeller would haue it to appear. The said Proclamation being made only to take away all excuse from such as might pretend ignorance of the day. Which being come, according to the custome of a long time obserued, the first meeting was begun with prayer & fasting, whereof the Libeller grants that intimation was made in the Church of Perth the Sonday preceding, but cōplaines that the fast was little regarded, & it may be by himself, & others of that Sect, whose dispositiōs were only to make strife: but he cannot deny, that in the first exercise of the morning, made by the Bishop of Abirdene, exhortation was giuen to all that were present, both to sanctifie themselues, & by prayer to cōmend the successe of the affairs vnto God his blessing. The same was repeated in the second

exercise made by the Archbishop of Saint-Andrewes, and nothing omitted on our parts, that was required to bring men to a due regard thereof. But the Libeller excepts against the second Sermon. First, that although the Text was pertinent, the Preacher ranne quickly from it: Next that in his Discourse of Ceremonies, & the fiue Articles proponed, his best Arguments were testimonies cited out of Caluine, Martyr and Beza, all peruerted. How the first can bee made good, I see not, seeing if the Text was pertinent, as he confessed, to the time and matters there to bee entreated, it is as cleere, that in all his Discourse, hee did so strictly keep himself to the purpose, as there was not so much as one digression made from it. And whether hee brought no Arguments for proofe, or peruerted the testimonies of these learned men: Let the Reader iudge, by the Sermon it selfe, which wee haue made here to bee inserted word for word, as the same was then deliuered.
         
         
            
            The Sermon preached by the Right Reuerend Father in GOD, the Archbishop of Saint ANDREWES, to the generall Assembly, holden at PERTH the 25. of August, 1618.

                  But if any man seeme to bee contentious, wee haue no such custome, neither the Churches of God.
               
            
            
               MY Lords, and Brethren: the businesse for which we meete heere, is knowne to you all: namely, to take some resolution in these Articles, which we are required to admit in our Church, by that power vnto which wee bee all subiect. Of the indifferency of these Articles, I thinke there is little or no question amongst vs: The conueniencie of them for our Church is doubted of by many, but not without cause; They are new and vncouth, such things as we haue not beene accustomed with; and nouations in a Church, euen in the smallest things are dangerous, Etiam quae vtilitate adiuuant, nouitate perturbant.
               
                  Aug. Epist. 118. Saint Augustine spake it long since, and wee haue tryed it to bee true this yeare past. I beseech God we feele no more of it hereafter. Had it beene in our power to haue disswaded or declined them, most certainly wee would; and if any of you thinke otherwise, yee are greatly mistaken: but now being brought to a necessitie (I am sorry to speake, more sorry to thinke of the This was the protestation that should haue beene presented to the last Parliament▪
                meanes that wrought the same) either of

yeelding, or disobeying him, whom for my selfe, I hold it Religion, to offend; I must tell you, that the euill of nouations, especially in matters of Rite & Ceremonie, is nothing so great as the euill of disobedience. That which is new this day, with a little vse, will become familiar and old: yee know the prouerbe, A wonder lasts but nine nights in a Towne. But how farre disobedience may goe, what euills it may produce, God knowes. As the Apostle speakes here of Contention, so I say of Disobedience, we haue no such custome, nor the Churches of God. We leaue that to Papists and Anabaptists, that carry no regard to authoritie: Our Religion teaches vs to obey our Superiours, in all things, that are not contrarie to the Word of God. So our Confession speakes, which is printed in the beginning of your Psalme bookes, So haue wee taught the people in former times,Psal. Booke, pag. 6. and God forbid, wee should now come in the contrarie.
            Our case, as I thinke, at this time, is not farre different from that of the Corinthians, at the writing of this Epistle: The question was amongst them, of the behauiour of men, and women in holy Assemblies. What was most decent and beseeming, men to be vncouered, women to haue their heads couered, or by the contrarie. Saint Paul, after that hee had shewed his owne minde in the matter, and giuen some reasons for it, as hee doth in the Verses preceding, concludes now with this protestation: If any man seeme to bee contentious, wee haue no such custome, neither the Churches of God. As though hee would say, I haue said so much as may content calme and moderate spirits; as for contentious men, I trouble not my selfe with them; They will still be disputing, and say what yee will, they shall still finde a reply, for they are 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , louers of Victorie, not of Veritie; men that seeketh not the Churches weale, but their owne wills, and make it their credit to bee alwayes stirring: that is not my custome, saith the Apostle (he might speake it well, for hee neuer cared for himselfe, or how he was counted of, so as he

might be profitable to the Church, and an instrument of sauing soules.) And as it is not my custome, no more is it the custome of the Churches of God; for they fauour not contention, but follow the things which concerne peace, wherewith one may edifie, and make better another.
            Some of the Interpreters refer these words to the question in hand, and thinke that the Apostle is here opposing the custome of the Churches, to these that contended for men couering their heads in publike meetings: but the better sort take this to bee spoken against the studie of contention, and thinke the Apostle his meaning here, is onely to shew, that it is not his fashion, nor the fashion of the Churches of God, to bee contentious for matters of such indifferency as those were of. This is Caluines interpretation amongst others, for he writing vpon this place, after he had said, that contention in a Church, is of all euills the most pernicious, addes by way of admonition these words: Diligenter notemus locum istum, ne abripi nos super vacuis disputationibus sinamus: Let vs carefully obserue this place, saith hee, that wee suffer not our selues to bee carryed away with vnnecessary disputings. Now, these are vnnecessary disputings, which are made, De rebus non magnis, of matters of light moment, Vel de rebus non ambiguis, that is, of matters in themselues cleare and euident. Atqui tales sunt importuni quidam disputatores, qui artis esse putant, omnia in dubium vocare: Some there are that can finde probabilities against the clearest Truth, and are still disputing about the lightest matters: Such are very troublers, and dangerous heads in a Church, of whom wee should be wary.
            Brethren, to contend is not a fault, if so it bee, for a weightie matter; but to bee contentious in a light businesse, this is faultie, and reprooued here by the Apostle. Wee ought to contend alwayes for the Faith, and that earnestly, as Saint Iude teacheth,
                  Iude 3. not yeelding to the Aduersarie, in the substance of Religion, one jot: There should our courage and spirituall zeale kindle it selfe;

but for matters of circumstance and ceremonie, to make businesse, and as much adoe, as if some mayne point of Religion were questioned, it is to iniurie the Truth of God. By this meanes, men are brought to misse-regard all Religion, and wee that are the Preachers of the Word, come to bee despised.
            In the meane time it is not to be denyed, but they are ceremonies, which for the inconuenience they bring, ought to be resisted; and if wee bee pressed with such, it is our part to expone our dislike of them in modestie, and by the best, wisest meanes we can vse, to decline these which wee esteeme to bee hurtfull: Not (as our follies haue beene great in this kinde) to runne before the time, and seeke to amend matters by declinators and protestations, whereby wee haue profited nothing; onely wee haue incensed authoritie, and hastened vpon our selues the same things which wee laboured to eschue. Well, these things cannot bee made vndone, yet, they should make vs wise for afterwards. And now, Brethren, because the resolution we take at this time touching the Articles propounded, will giue to the world a testimonie what manner of men wee are, whether such as rule their proceedings by iudgement, or are carried head-strong with conceits and opinions; that wee bee nor misse-led by ignorance (for that is the fault of many amongst vs, wee inquire not of matters, nor take paynes to vnderstand what hath beene the iudgement of the most wise and learned, but follow vpon trust, the opinions we haue beene bred with, and of such as we affect) to helpe this, I say, I will, with your patience, spend some time in the question of Ceremonies, see what warrant they haue, and how they should bee appointed: then from the generall descend to speake of our particulars, touching which I shall freely deliuer my owne minde, and so conclude.
            First, then concerning Ceremonies, howsoeuer some haue imagined them to bee superfluities, which might well bee spared, and that the Church of Rome hath made the very

name of them hatefull, aswell because of the multitude of them, wherewith she oppressed Christians, as for the ridiculous choice she made of most of them: are such things, as without which no publike action either Ciuill, or Ecclesiastique can be rightly performed.
            To this purpose a Politike Writer, hath said well, That as the flesh couereth the hollow deformity of the bones, and beautifieth the bodie with naturall graces, so Ceremonies (such specially, as ancient custome hath made reuerend) couer the nakednesse of publike actions, and distinguish them from priuate businesse, that otherwise should not bee so well knowne. The neglect of this in any State, breedes confusion, and with confusion the ruine, and abolishment of the State it selfe; whereof the examples were easie to be giuen in the Romane Republike, and others, if that were our subiect. But wee are speaking of Church-Ceremonies, concerning which no man will deny this generall truth: That in euery publike dutie, which God craues at our hands, there is besides the matter and forme wherein the substance of the dutie consists, a certaine externall forme required, to the decent administration of the same. As for example: God hath commanded his Word to bee preached, and the holy Sacraments to be ministred, Baptisme by the Element of Water, and in a prescript forme of words, such as you know wee vse; and the Sacrament of his blessed Body and Bloud, in the Elements of Bread and Wine, with certaine mysticall words added thereunto: heere is the dutie to bee done, and the substance of it; yet for the ministration of the same in a due and decent manner, there is place, time, and other circumstances moe required. The substance of the dutie God hath giuen vs in the Word, from which we may not goe; but for these things that belong to the outward administration, Ecclesiasticall wisedome hath to define what is conuenient, what not; Ne
                     
                        
                     
                     que
                   tamen permisit Dominus vagam, effrae nam
                     
                        
                     
                     que
                   licentiam (sayes Caluine) sed cancellos, vt ita loquar, circūdedit: That is, God hath not giuen his Church an

illimited power, to establish what Ceremonies she lists, but hath enrayled her authoritie within borders which she may not passe;1 Cor. 1
                     •
                  . and these are, 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               . Let all things bee done honestly, and by order: Honestly, that is, after a good fashion in a decent sort, and to the right ends, namely, the aduancement of Gods honour, and the edification of his Church. This is 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               . Then they must be done 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , by order; that is, appointed, with deliberation, and by such as haue the authoritie to ordaine them; and being once appointed, and concluded by Constitutions, they must bee kept and performed by all that are subiect to the same.
            This, as one speakes well, is that great Ecclesiasticall Canon, by which all other Canons must bee squared; this is the true Touch-stone of trying Ceremonies, and the ballance wherein all Church Orders must be weighed. The Ceremonies of the Church must be decent and comely, without vanitie, without all meretricious brauerie, not superfluous, but seruing to edification. They must also be done to Gods honour, and not be idolatrous or superstitious; Generally in the Church, all things must be done in order, and no confusion be either of persons or proceedings, for order hath proceeded from the Throne of the Almightie. This fabricke of the World that wee see, is vpholden by it, States, and Kingdomes are maintayned by it, and without it nothing can flourish or prosper. And if Order should haue place in all things, sure the Church of God, should not be without Order; for our God, whom wee serue, is the God of Order, and not of Confusion, as the Apostle speakes.
            These things will be easily condescended vpon, I meane, that religious duties cannot bee performed without externall Rites: that these Rites should bee qualited, as I haue said, established by Lawes, and after they are established, obeyed by such as are subiect; Si enim velut in medio positae, singulorum arbitrio relictae fuerint, quoniam nunquam futurum est, vt omnibus idem placeat, breui futura est rerum omnium

confusio. This is Caluines saying in the fourth Booke of his Institutions, and tenth Chapter, which Chapter I would earnestly recommend to your reading, for these matters chiefly. In such generals, it may bee wee all agree; but when wee come to particulars; Tanta moribus hominum inest diuersitas, tanta in animis varietas, tanta in iudicijs, ingenijs
                     
                        
                     
                     que
                   pugna: Such is the varietie of mens minds and opinions, that scarce shall they euer bee brought to agree vpon any one thing. For the Ceremonie, which to one will seeme decent and comely, will to another appeare not to be so. Now in this case what is to bee done? Some would haue vs search into the Apostolike times, examine what then was in vse to bee done, and follow that. But this cannot well be the rule, seeing the Apostles haue not deliuered in writing all that they did; and diuers of the formes vsed by them, which by occasion wee haue recorded, are vnfit for these times, and inconuenient: such as the assembling of people in close and secret meetings, their Christnings in Riuers, the ministring of the Lords Supper after meate, 
                  〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
               , or Church-Feasts, the abhorring of leuened Bread, abstayning from Bloud, and that which is strangled, the arbitrary maintenance of Ministers, and other more particulars; which to bring againe in vse, were to alter and change in a sort the state of Christianitie it selfe. So it being to vs vncertaine, what the formes of the Apostles were in euery thing; and the dissimilitude of their times and ours being so great, they giue no sure direction that send vs to seeke the resolution of our differences in matters of this nature from them. Reade Beza his eight Epistle written to that Reuerend Bishop Edmond Grindall, then Bishop of London, and you shall finde this to bee his iudgement: His words are, Scio duplicem esse de Ecclesiarum instauratione opinionem: sunt qui Apostolicae ill
                     •
                   simplicitati, nihil adijciendum putant, ac proinde quicquid Apostoli fecerunt, faciendum; quicquid autem succedens Apostolis Ecclesia, ritibus primis adiecit, semel abolendum existiment. There are some, sayes he, who thinke, that we should adde nothing

vnto that first Apostolike simplicity, but doe in euery thing according as they did: And that, whatsoeuer the succeeding Ages added in matters of Rites, should be all abolished. Because his answere and discourse is somewhat long, I will remit you to the place, and giue you the heads of it only; first, therefore he sayes, that the doctrine of the Apostles, is in it selfe so exact and perfect, as we ought not to derogate, nor adde any thing vnto it: but next for the Rites and Ceremonies of the Church, wee must not thinke so, because the Apostles at the first, could not set downe euery thing that was expedient for the Church, and thereupon they proceeded by little and little; and in such Rites as they instituted, they had a speciall respect to the time, places and persons, wherof many were afterwards by the Church worthily abolished. Hauing said this, hee concludes, Ita
                     
                        
                     
                     que
                   quicquid ab Apostolis factitatum est, quod ad ritus attinet, nec statim, nec sine aliqua exceptione sequendum existimo. And Caluine whom I often name, for the authority, which he deseruedly carries with all Reformed Churches, in the tenth Chapter of his fourth Booke of Institutions, which place I formerly quoted, hath to the same purpose these words. In his quae cultum Numinis spectant, solus Magister est audiendus; quia autem in externa disciplina & ceremonijs, non voluit sigillatim praescribere quid sequi debeamus, quòd istud pendêre à temporum conditione praeuideret, ne
                     
                        
                     
                     que

                     que
                   ad ordinem & decorum praecipi recessitas Ecclesiae postulabit: And after a few lines: Prout Ecclesiae vtilitas requirit, tam vsitatas mutare & abrogare, quàm nouas institue
                     •
                  e ceremonias, Ecclesiae licitum. His iudgement is, that the power of adding, altering, innouating, and appointing Ceremonies, remaynes with the Church, to doe therein as shee in her wisedome shall thinke meete. And certainly, there is no other way to keepe away differences for matters of Rites and Ceremonies, but this, That euery man keepe the custome of the Church wherein

he liues, and obserue that which is determined by the Gouernours thereof. For in things indifferent wee must alwayes esteeme that to bee best, and most seemely, which seemes so in the eye of publike authoritie. Neither is it for priuate men to controll publike iudgement: as they cannot make publike Constitutions, so they may not controll nor disobey them being once made. Indeed authoritie ought to looke carefully vnto this, that it prescribe nothing but rightly; appoint no Rites nor Orders in the Church, but such as may set forward Godlinesse and Pietie: yet put the case, that some be otherwise established, they must be obeyed by such as are members of that Church, as long as they haue the force of a Constitution, and are not corrected by the authoritie that made them. Except this be, there can bee no order, and all must be filled with strife and contention. But thou wilt say, My conscience suffers mee not to obey, for I am perswaded, that such things are not right, nor well appointed. I answere thee, in matters of this nature and qualitie, the sentence of thy Superiours ought to direct thee, and that is a sufficient ground to thy conscience for obeying. But may not Superiours erre? May not Councels decree that which is wrong? This no man denyes, and if they decree any thing against Scripture, it is not to be obeyed; for there that Sentence holds good, Melius obedire Deo quam hominibus. But if that which is decreed, be not repugnant to the Word, and that thou hast no more but thy owne collections and motions of thy conscience, as thou callest it, how strong soeuer thy perswasions bee, it is presumption in thee to disobey the Ordinance of the Church. And of this wee may bee sure, whosoeuer denyes obedience to Church Ordinances in rebus medijs, the same will not sticke to reiect Gods owne Word, when it crosses his fancie; Et videant isti, (sayes Caluine) qui plus sapere volunt quam oportet, qua ratione morositatem suam Domino opprobent, Nobis enim satisfacere istud Pauli d

                  as Dei. With such a sentence I close all that I purposed to say of Ceremonies in generall.
            Now hauing shewed you, that Rites are necessary in a Church, the qualities they should haue, and obedience that must bee giuen vnto the Constitutions of the Church once being made, I come to the particulars desired of vs to bee receiued: these must bee seuerally considered, because they are not all of the like respect: some of them strike vpon the duties of our calling, enioyning the practice thereof in places, and at times where vsuall solemnitie cannot bee kept; as to administrate Baptisme in priuate houses in the case of necessitie, and the Communion to these that are sicke, and in dying: Others of them prescribe the obseruation of certayne things not in vse with vs, as the confirming of Children, and the keeping of some Festiuities throughout the yeere. And there is a fift Article that requires our accustomed manner of sitting at the Communion, to be changed in a more religious and reuerend gesture of kneeling: ye shall not expect to heare all that may be said, or is at this time expedient concerning these, neither the time, nor the strength of any one man, I think, will suffice to say all without interruption. I know I speake to men of vnderstanding, and my intent is to say no more of them, then may serue to iustifie the aduise which I minde with Gods helpe to giue vnto you.
            I begin with the Communion to the Sicke, because this Article passed in the late Assembly, with some limitations which his Maiesty disliked. The mind that is offended hardly interprets any thing well, so fared it in this matter. The delay of our answere to the rest of the Articles, mooued his Maiestie to call our grant of this Article scornfull and ridiculous. I was bold in a priuate Letter to shew there was a mistaking, and iustifie that which was done; neither should I speake any more of it, but that it hath beene complayned, that some of our Ministerie, beeing earnestly entreated by

certaine sicke persons, for the comfort of that Sacrament, since that time haue denyed the same. To iustifie therefore that which then was inacted, I say shortly, that by our calling wee are directly bound to minister vnto men in the last houre all the helpes and comforts wee possibly can: the naturall terrours of death, and fearefull doubts of conscience which at that time commonly perplexe men, require this at our hands; therefore Visitation of the sicke is earnestly commended to Ministers in their admission, that they bee readie to attend the sicke person, and as his estate craues, minister comfort vnto him, by preaching the promises of grace and mercie to all penitent sinners. Why this Sacrament, that is the seale of Gods promises, and a speciall meane of binding vp our Communion with Christ, should bee denyed to such as desire the same in that time, there can be no reason.
            Howbeit saluation depends not vpon the Sacrament, and that they vse it superstitiously that giues it for a viaticum to the dying, the end of a man cannot but be the more comfortable, and his death accompanyed with the greater contentment and tranquilitie of minde, when his desire is satisfied in this point. For this is to bee considered, that it is not to all that die, nor to all that are sicke, but to such onely whose recouery is desperate, and vrgently desire the comfort of this Sacrament, that the same is appointed to bee ministred. Of which purpose Caluin deliuers his opinion in his 52. Epistle, in these words: De Coenae administratione censeo, libenter admittendum esse hunc morem, vt apud aegrotos celebretur communio, quum ita res & opportunitas feret; Nec magnopere repugnandum esse, quin maleficis detur, qui plectendi sunt, si quidem postulent, & ad receptionem satis comparatos esse appareat: hac tamen lege, vt sit vnà communio, hoc est, vt panis in coetu aliquo fidelium frangatur. And in his 361. Epistle, answering some one that had moued him in this matter, he beginnes on this manner: Cur coenam aegrotis negandam esse non arbitror, multae & graues causae me impellunt, as you may see in the place. Bucer, Bullinger, and Zepperus are of the same

iudgement; and the last of these three, putting the case, that none is by this sicke man disposed to communicate, sayes, Quod ne sic quidem priuandus est communione aegrotus. You may see his reasons in the twelft Chapter of his first Booke, De Politia Ecclesiastica. Our owne Church hath practised the same in former times, as was qualified in diuers particulars at the last Assembly. So where the reformed Churches haue approued it, and wee our selues by our owne practice, now to stand against it, when, by a speciall Canon it is appointed to bee done, cannot but bee thought obstinate disobedience.
            I come to the Article of Baptisme: This craues that in the case of necessitie, when a child without hazard may not bee brought out of doores, it bee lawfull to the Minister to baptise in a priuate house. It was not long since, a custome amongst vs, that no Minister would baptise, except vpon the ordinarie day of teaching; this same being complayned of in the Assembly that was kept at Holy Rood-house, in the yeare 1602. an Ordinance was made, that whensoeuer a Parent should require baptisme to his child, the Minister should not deny it, without delaying to the ordinarie day of preaching. The question was then of the Time, now it is of the Place: Whereabout, this you all know, that in the institution of Baptisme, the Lord Iesus hath not tyed vs to any place, but his command binds all men to bee baptized: And wee, that are Ministers, by our calling are obliged to baptise, howsoeuer wee doe not thinke Baptisme absolutely necessary vnto saluation, and the child that wants it vpon a necessitie ineuitable, nothing preiudiced that way; yet if the occasion present, there is no doubt, but the Minister hath a necessitie lying vpon him to baptize, although time, place, and other circumstances required for the due and solemne administration be not concurring. But this, yee will say, fosters the Popish opinion of the necessitie of Baptisme. Let Buce
                     •
                  
                answer it, To with-hold Baptisme for want of the due solemnities, sayes hee, opens a doore to the Deuill, to bring in the contempt

of Christs Ordinance, and our whole redemption by him: We haue a Commandement to baptize, and this to vs is a necessary duety which we may not leaue vndone: As for inconueniences, we must meet them as wisely, as we may, by doctrine and diligent catechizing, but in no sort neglect the Commandement that is giuen. Yee shall haue Caluin his iudgement also in this matter; being asked: Vbinam baptismus recte administrari possit? He answers, Fas non est administrare baptismum, nisi in coetu fidelium, non quidem v
                     •
                   templum requiratur, sed vt vbiuis, numerus aliquis fidelium conueniat, qui Ecclesiae corpus efficiat. Yee haue this in his 185. Epistle. And thus much for Baptisme.
            The third Article is of Confirmation, to be giuen to children, when they are come to the yeares of discretion, and that is one of the most ancient customes of the Christian Church, from the dayes of the Apostles it hath continued, and with them it began. Neither is there any thing more profitable, for it helps children to bee seasoned with the principles of true Religion, layes a good foundation for the better direction of their whole life, preserues the seede of the Church sound, makes children more diligent to learne, and Pastors, and Parents more carefull to instruct them. The neglect of this dutie hath done much harme in the Church, and the restitution of that good custome, which Caluin in the fourth Booke of his Institutions earnestly wishes, could not but bring with it an exceeding great benefit. It was in substance agreed vnto in the Assembly at Abirdene; but two things his Maiestie found deficient in the Act: One that there was no mention of laying on of hands vpon the child confirmed: Another was, that the performance of it was not restricted to the Bishops care. And for this last, it is cleare by all Antiquitie, that the power of Confirming appertayned euer to Bishops; Not, that Confirmation is a Sacrament of greater dignitie then Baptisme, as the Papists teach (these were the thoughts of ignorance:) but as S. Hierome speakes, The Church thought fit, that seeing Baptisme is giuen by

Presbyters, lest children should be ignorant of the spirituall superioritie of Bishops ouer them, they should attend the receiuing of Confirmation by their hands; so, this was done for the honour of Prelacy, as he speakes. Now, if any man will enuy this honour to Bishops, it is a silly and poore enuy: for it encreases their charge and burthen; and if the conscience of their dutie make them not carefull of it, in this profane and irreligious age, the honor or credit it can bring them, will neuer worke it: Touching imposition of hands, let Saint Augustine tell vs what it meanes: Hee in his fift Booke, De Baptismo contra Donatistas, cap. 23. sayes, Quid est manuum impositio, nisi oratio super hominem? that is to say, What is imposition of hands, but a prayer vpon the man, that hands are laid vpon? In all personall benedictions, from the very beginning of the world, it hath beene vsed: Parents doe yet confer their blessing in this manner to their children, and when spirituall blessings are giuen, there can bee no offence to doe it with the like ceremonie. But I heare that some cannot abide to heare the word of Confirmation; the thing it selfe gladly they admit, but they would haue examination, or some the like word put for it: Not onely the abuse, but the very name of the thing abused, (so tender are the hearts of some men) must be put away. For this shortly, I say, that the Scriptures neuer taught vs to place Religion in wordes. Saint Luke made no scruple, speaking of a street in Athens, to call it the street of Mars: And the ship that Paul sayled in, he names by Castor and Pollux, though both these were the Idols of Pagans. If names were to be stood vpon, we should put our selues to great businesse, & it behoueth to change the names of our Moneths, and Dayes, which some haue pressed vnto, but wise men know this to be folly. Besides, the word of Confirmation was vsed in the Church long before Popery was hatched, as is manifest by Saint Cyprian, Saint Augustine, Tertullian, Eusebius, and others. And thus much of Confirmation.
            
               The Festiuities, which are the next, are impugned by this Argument amongst others, That hereby wee conforme our selues to Papists in the keeping of holy dayes: But had this Argument beene of any force, would the reformed Churches haue agreed so vniformely in the obseruation of them? All of them, so farre as I know, keepe holy the dayes of Christs Natiuitie, Passion, Resurrection, and Ascension, with the Descent of the holy Ghost. The Churches of Bohemie, Vngarie, Polonia, Denmarke, Saxonie, and high Germany: The Heluetian Churches, the Belgique, and those of the low Countreyes; The French, English, and Geneua it selfe, in the beginning of reformation, obserued them all. The day of Natiuitie they yearely celebrate, if I be rightly informed; the rest are abrogated, and by what occasion, reade the 115. and 128. Epistles of Caluin, where after he had shewed the occasion of their abolishment, hee addes: Ego ne

For the opinions of the rest of our Diuines in this particular, Bucer, Martyr, Bullinger, Zanchius, Aretius, Polanus, Paraeus, and Tilenus, with all that I haue seene, speake manifestly for it. Tilenus his words in his Systema, which came forth the last yeare, are these: Alios dies praeter

I find in a Synod kept at Middleburgh, Anno 1584. a Canon there made, that all holy dayes should be abolished, except the Lords day, and the day of Christs Natiuitie, and Ascension. But if the Magistrates shall require moe to bee kept, then the Ministers shall labour by preaching to turne the peoples idlenesse into godly exercises and businesse. These be the wordes of that Canon, which I haue cited, aswell

to shew you, what that Church ascribes to Magistrates, as because our case in this particular is verie like. His Majestie, as you know, hath charged all his Subiects by Proclamation to abstaine from seruile labour in these times, and it should become vs wel as that Act speaks, to turn them from idlenes to godly exercises. For to dispute of the lawfulnes of the prohibitiō, ne

                   huius fori, nor will any Subiect that is in his right wits, presume to doe it. I doe not vrge the testimonies of the Fathers in this poynt, because of them; you who were at the last Assembly, heard enough: And they who eleuate the consent of antiquitie in this matter, saying, That the mysterie of iniquitie was then begun to worke, will reuerence, as I trust, the iudgement of these reformed Writers, who haue laboured to discouer that Mysterie, and will thinke it no commendation to them, to be dissenting from all the Churches that haue beene, and are in the world.
            Of the last Article, which requires kneeling, as the most reuerend gesture in partaking the holy Sacrament of the Communion, I haue neede to say much, seeing great stirres are made for this, and as I esteeme without any cause. The Apostle when he professes to deliuer vnto vs that which hee receyued of the Lord, speakes not, either of sitting, or kneeling, or standing; by which it is euident, That situs, vel positus corporis in coena, as Zepperus speakes, is not of the essence of the Sacrament, but to be numbered amongst these circumstances, which the Church may alter, and change at their pleasure. Where it is said, that wee ought to conforme our selues to Christs action, yee know it is answered, That if so were, it behoued vs to lye along about the Table; to communicate with men, and not with women: And in the Euening after supper, receiue this Sacrament, which things were ridiculous to affirme. Peter Martyr, an excellent witnesse of Gods truth, In classe secunda Loc
                     •
                  rum communium Cap. 4. speakes otherwise: Nihil interest, saith he, si coenae Dominicae sacramentum stantes, aut sedentes, aut genibus flexis percipiamus, modò institutum Domini conseruetur, & occasio superstitionibus

praecidatur. And in his Defence of the doctrine of the Eucharist aduersus Gardinerum, answering the same argument, which Bellarmine brings for reall presence: Although in receyuing the Sacrament, saith he, we adore the Lord by kneeling, we doe not thereby testifie the real
                  •
                and corporall presence of Christ in the Sacrament: for adoration, the mind not being applied to the elements, but to the things signified, may lawfully bee vsed. Peter Mouline in defence of his Maiesties Apologie against the Frier Copheteau, where the Frier alledges some testimonies out of S. Ambrose, S. Augustine, and S. Chrysostome, to proue the adoration of the consecrated Hoste, answers, That the Fathers say nothing, but that which wee willingly graunt. Is there any amongst vs, saith he, who euer denyed, that we ought to adore the flesh of Iesus Christ? Who euer doubted, that wee ought to adore him in the Eucharist? But he that adores Iesus Christ in the Eucharist, does not for all that, adore that which the Priest holds in his hand, but he adores Iesus Christ who is in Heauen. These worthie men scorne (as yee see) Bellarmines argument, howbeit wee can take out of an enemies mouth, and make somewhat of nothing, to beare out our owne conceits. Th. Beza did not approue this gesture of kneeling, yet did he neuer esteeme it Idolatrie, as some of our Spirits doe. In his 12. Epistle he writes thus Geniculatio dum symbola accipiuntur speci

            But there came out a Pamphlet in the yeare 1608, written by some peruerse Spirit in the English Church, of this argument, which findes too good entertainement in some

of you my Brethren: Worse, and more desperate Blasphemies did neuer any Arriane cast out; for this directly he saies, That in the receyuing the holy Communion, we ought not vse any right, that may signifie ou

                inferioritie vnto Christ, neyther should we abase our selues there, but acknowledge and thinke vs his equalls. I pray God keepe vs from this Diuinitie. Doubtlesse such conceits as these, brought the Church of Pole in that generall Synode, which was kept anno 1578. simply to condemne sitting, as a ceremonie vnhonest, and vnlawfull for so holy an exercise: In the act concerning ceremonies to bee vsed in the administration of the Supper, they haue these words; Libertati christianae donamus vt stantes, vel genua flectentes pij Sacramentum corporis, & sanguinis Christi sumant: Sessiones ve

                   admodum scandalo sam ceremoniam reijcimus. VVe may not thinke it was any light cause, which made that Church thus peremptorie in their decree: Their troubles were great, and as I heare, yet are, by the Arrians: And beleeue mee, Brethren, such as can away with the speeches of that Pamphlet, are not far frō that side. Wee haue learned otherwayes to honour the Sonne, as wee honour the Father, and he that honours not the Sonne so in euery place, especially in the participation of the holy Supper, should be to vs as a Iew or Pagan. I shall insist no longer in this purpose: It is an excellent passage that of Saint Augustine vpon the 98. Psalme, Nemo carnem illam manducat, nisi prius adorauerit: That is, No man can eate that flesh vnlesse first he haue adored. For my selfe, I thinke sitting in the beginning, was not euilly instituted, and since by ou
                  •
                Church continued; for wee may adore while we are sitting, aswell as kneeling: yet the gesture which becommeth adoration best, is that of bowing of the knee, and the irreligion of these times craues, that we should put men more vnto it, then we doe.
            
               Thus I haue shewed you the iudgement of the best Reforformed Churches touching these Articles: Thereby you haue seene that there is nothing impious or vnlawfull in them: they who shew a dislike of some of them in the last Assembly, could not say other. And surely, if it cannot bee shewed, that they are repugnant to the written Word, I see not with what conscience wee can refuse them, being vrged as they are, by our Souereigne Lord and King: A King who is not a stranger to Diuinitie, but hath such acquaintance with it, as Rome neuer found in the confessions of all men a more potent Aduersary: a King neither superstitious, nor inclinable that way, but one that seekes to haue God rightly and truly worshipped by all his Subiects. His Person, were he not our Souereigne, giues them sufficient authoritie, being recommended by him; for hee knowes the nature of things and the consequences of them, what is fit for a Church to haue, and what not, better then we doe all.
            But I heare some answere, That were it knowne, these things proceeded of himselfe, they would make the lesse question of them: but they are thought to come by the suggestion of some of the English Church, or them of our selues at home. For the first, I will but remember you of his Maiesties owne Declaration in the Chappell of Saint-Andrewes, where with a great attestation more then needed from a Prince to his Subiects, Hee declared that neither the desire he had for conforming his Churches, nor the solicitation of any person, did set him on this worke, but his zeale for God, and a certaine knowledge that hee could not answere it in that great Day, if hee should neglect this dutie. His Maiesties Letter to the last Assembly beares so much also. Now any of vs would take it euill, not to be beleeued after our solemne attestations: and I trust in all your confessions, his Maiestie deserues some greater respect. As to that which is supposed of vs at home, my selfe chiefly, if I shall beleeue the rumours that are going, I will borrow that notable man his speech in a case not vnlike, Mihi hactenus propemodum

fatale fuit, putidis his calumnijs quotidie onerari; ego autem vt sanctè testari possum me inscio,
               
                  Caluine.
                
               ac ne optante quidem haec proposita, ita ab initio in animum induxi inuidiam potius tacendo leuare, quàm excusationes quaerere minus solicitas. This was my resolution, and I should not change it, but that I will not haue a misconceit of my doings, to leade you into an offence: I therefore in the presence of the Almightie God, and of this honourable Assembly, solemnely protest, that without my knowledge, against my desire, and when I least expected, these Articles were sent vnto mee, not to be proponed to the Church, but to bee inserted amongst the Canons thereof, which then were in gathering: touching which point I humbly excused my selfe, that I could not insert amongst the Canons, that which was not first aduised with the Church, and desired they might bee referred to another consideration. Neither did I heare after that time of them any thing, while that Protestation was formed to bee presented to the States of Parliament: at what time, his Maiestie taking the aduantage of their mis-behauiour, who penned the Protestation and proudly stood to the same, resolued to haue these Articles admitted in our Church, wherin all my care was to saue the Church her authoritie, and labour that they might be referred to an Assembly; which was obtayned vpon promise, that his Maiesty should receiue satisfaction, and the promise was not made by mee alone, but ratified by your selues, as you remember at Saint-Andrewes. In the Assembly that followed, howsoeuer my aduice took no place, I ioyned after the dissoluing therof with my Lords the Bishops, to excuse the delay that was made at the time: but our Letter being euill accepted, and another returning full of anger and indignation, which diuerse of your selues haue seene, I trauelled at the Ministers their earnest solicitation, by all the wayes I could, to diuert the troubles, which before this time most certainly yee would haue felt. And all that hath proceeded since ye know. So as I spake before, I would, if it had beene in my power, most willingly

haue declined the receiuing of these Articles. Not, that I did esteeme them either vnlawfull or inconuenient, for I am so farre perswaded of the contrary, as I can bee of any thing; but I foresaw the contradiction which would bee made, and the businesse we should fall into. Therefore, let no man deceiue himselfe; these things proceede from his Maiestie, and are his owne motions, not any others.
            I heare others say, they could agree with the Articles, but that they take them to be introductions of the rest of the English Ceremonies, wherewith they cannot away. To this I answer, That the ready way to haue the rest imposed, is to offend his Maiestie by our resisting; and the way to be freed of them, is to approue our selues in the obedience of these. Thereby both yee and wee shall finde a more gracious hearing in any thing that concerneth the Church. Call to mind the eourses of former times, and tell me if our oppositions did euer gayne vs any thing? If experience will not make vs wise, what can?
            But this, others say, is hard to bee done: because our preaching and practice haue both beene to the contrarie, and a yeelding now cannot but s
                  •
               ayne our credits. I will not reply, that it is no credit to be constant in euill, nor any discredit to change for the better; for this would sound harshly in the eares of many: onely I shall wish those who stand so much for their credit, to lay before themselues Saint Pauls example, who became all to all, that hee might saue some. Hee had preached against Circumcision; against the keeping of the Iewish Sabbaths, their new Moones, and other Rites: he had called them yokes, burthens, impotent, and beggarly rudiments; and reproued Saint Peter for making the Gentiles conforme to the Iewes in these things; yet after all this he circumcised Timothy, and practised himselfe diuers of their Ceremonies. The reason was, that he saw no other way to redeeme the libertie of his Ministerie, further the Gospell, and increase the Churches: In this hee placed his credit, and so hee did speed in that; hee stood not much

what men reported of him. If the zeale of God leade vs, and the loue of his Church, wee will not looke so much to our selues and to our owne reputation, as to the furthering of the worke of the Gospell.
            It will be replyed, I know, that not for themselues, but for the offence of the people, they feare to admit these things. For hauing preached against holy dayes, and the rest, and hauing defended the Constitutions of the Church, which now must be altered, there cannot but great offence ensue. I can make no other answer to this, then say, That, I trust, none of our Preachers haue stood against the keeping of dayes simply; but against the superstitious keeping of them as Papists doe, and against the lasciuiousnesse of people, prophaning those dayes by vnlawfull exercises: Nor haue wee taught at any time, sitting to be of the essence of the Sacrament and a Rite that may not be changed; for in that case it is necessary for the Truths sake to informe them otherwise, and make it seene that wee loue Truth more then our owne reputation. If our iudgements haue beene misse-led, and that we haue misse-led others, it is good, that we being resolued of the Truth, helpe to resolue others also. But I doe not suppose any such ignorance in my brethren; I know, people thinke many times wee contradict our selues, when there is nothing lesse; for they distinguish not well of things, and haue many mistakings. Alwayes, this is sure, the framing of peoples conceits lyes much in our hands. The Dayes required to bee obserued, haue beene kept this last yeare in the chiefe Burghes by his Maiesties command, what offenc
                  •
                thereof did we find amongst the people? The Communio

                beholders.
            
               But this, they say, takes not away the offence: for Papists will boast, that wee are drawing backe towards them, and the godly cannot but be grieued, that haue a dislike of their Ceremonies. For Papists, first, wee are not to regard them, It is their manner to make aduantage of euery thing: say or doe what wee will, they will still speake euill of the Truth. Are the Churches of England, Germany, and Bohemie in better termes with Papists, then wee? Yee know not how things goe in the world, if yee thinke so. Papists are not the fooles we take them, to be pleased with shadowes, they haue other more substantiall notes, by which they discerne their friends, then by ceremonies. As for the godly amongst vs, wee are sorry they should bee grieued, but it is their owne fault: for if the things be in themselues lawfull, what is it that should offend them? They say, these alterations can worke no good. I answer, The alteration is necessary, if it bee necessary for our Church to inioy his Maiesties fauour, and if it be necessary, it must also be profitable. Naem causa necessitatis, & vtilitatis aequiparantur in iure. But if they thinke that we should regard their offence, and offence of other good Christians, let them know that the offence of our gracious Soueraigne is more to vs then theirs, and a thousand moe.
            Yet were it not better, that his Maiestie should by his authoritie inioyne them, rather then the Church giue any consent, and when the time shall grow better, we may then returne to our old custome? for these are the motions of some. What they call better times, I know not, but our fathers saw neuer so good times, nor is it to be hoped that our posteritie shall see the like. Continuance detracts from the worth of things, at least in our conceits: wee haue enioyed peace and libertie so long, that we little know how precious they are. But had we beene in the coates of our fathers, or could wee remember the straits our first Reformers stood in, and were brought vnto in the same Citie, when that good Earle Alexander came to their reliefe, wee would thinke it

no small blessing to haue our Profession countenanced by Authoritie. As to that which they desire, that his Maiestie should inioyn these things by Authoritie, I leaue it to you to iudge how dangerous the same may proue to the Church. If cōformity be enioyned, be sure it wil not be in these matters only, but in others that yee hate more: But I feare it be the purpose of many to rubbe this way vpon his Maiesty the imputation of tyrannie: for what Christian King did euer determine in Ecclesiasticall matters any thing without aduice of his Clergie? And to impose Lawes vpon the Church without their consent, were as much as to say, the King imposes things vnlawfull: for if they be lawfull, Why will wee be dissenting? Brethren, his Maiestie is styled, Defender of the Faith, and hath it by desert, aswell as by inheritance: It were a peruerse course for vs to make it seeme otherwayes. When Iesuites and Papists of all sorts, are by their infamous writings, belying his Maiestie, and traducing his Highnesse fame, onely because he opposes them for the defence of the common Faith; if wee should furnish them matter of new obloquie by our rebellion, we could neuer be excused of vile ingratitude. Rests but one obiection that I haue heard, which I will not omit: They say, the English Church hath beene seeking of old times to haue vs wonder their gouernment; and vpon this, some haue called our yeelding vnto a conformitie in these points with them, a betraying of the libertie of our Church and Kingdome. This reason is so euill grounded, that though we should conforme with them in euery outward Rite, obserued not onely by them but by the whole Church of Christ, long before it was so infected with Poperie: it would not inferre the dependance of our Church vpon theirs, but that there is that harmony and conformitie amongst vs, which ought to bee amongst all the reformed Churches both in Doctrine and Discipline. And for our part in maintayning our right, yee may remember not long since, when that Noble man was absolued in England who was excommunicate by vs, wee ceassed not to complaine vntill a

new command was giuen, that hee should receiue from vs a new absolution. If matters should come thus to be contested for, which is not to bee expected, wee should not bee found neglectful either of our Church or Country. But what is this we are iealous of? We liue vnder a King, that loues the kingdomes honour more then we all; there offers not one occasion, wherein his Maiestie failes to expresse his naturall affection towards his country. Euen now that Mischant, sometimes one of your number, and vnworthy to be named, did vomit forth his spite and vnnatural malice against the whole Nation: And how did his Maiestie resent it? As I haue beene aduertised, he did solemnely declare, That albeit much had beene said against his Maiesties owne person, and nothing omitted in that kinde, which the Deuill could inuent, yet all that did not so much grieue him, as that Mischants taxing of his Country and Nation: He is not worthy the name, I will not say of a Christian, but of a Scottish man, that will not, if need be, lay downe his life to meet his Maiesties affection. I know yee are ready enough to make your protestations this way, but beleeue me, he shall neuer hazard willingly his life for his Prince, who stands against his pleasure in so iust demands.
            I will say no more, for I haue wearied both you and my selfe, out of a desire to giue satisfaction to you all. How freely and plainly I haue spoken, ye are my witnesses: with what an affection towards the Churches good, God hee knowes. Brethren, wee haue made too much businesse about these matters. The Kingdome of God consists not in them, but in righteousnesse and peace, and ioy of the holy Ghost. Away with fruitlesse and contentious disputings. Remember the worke wee are sent for, is to build the Church of God, and not to destroy it; to call men to Faith and Repentance; to stirre them vp to the works of true pietie and loue, and not to make them thinke they haue Religion enough when they haue talked against Bishops and Ceremonies. If wee shall goe about this carefully, and all of vs striue in our places, by

fruitfull preaching, honest liuing, and a wise gouerning, to approue our selues vnto the consciences of our people, wee shall shortly finde matters in a better estate then wee haue seene, and be all of vs an acceptable people to the Lord our God; which that it may bee, God for his Christs sake grant to vs all. Amen.
            
            THe Sermon ended, the Archbishop of Saint Andrewes came to the Table, at which his Maiesties Commissioners, Noble men, and other members of the Assembly, were sitting; and calling for the ordinarie Clerke of the Assembly, was answered, That Master Thomas Nicholson, who formerly serued the Church in that place, had dimitted his office in fauour of Master Iames Sandelands Aduocate: This he notified to the Assembly, as that which hee had vnderstood before and shewed that the said Master Iames was a man sufficiently qualified for the place, of good report, and one that by his aduocation and pleading might further the particular businesse of Ministers before the Session. He desired the Assembly to consider what was fittest to bee done, and aduise whether they would receiue the said Master Iames in the others place or not: The voyces of his Maiesties Commissioners, the Noble men, Bishops, and diuers of the Ministers being asked, they all without exception agreed to his receiuing. And the said Master Iames being recalled (for while the voyces were asked, he was remoued) had an oath ministred vnto him, for his diligent and faithfull discharge of that seruice.
            The Libeller obserues here, first, That seates being appointed for Noble men, Barons, Burgesses, and Bishops, with the Doctors; the Ministers were left to stand behinde them as if their part had onely beene to behold; Then sayes, that the choosing of Master Iames Sandelands to be Clerke, was done without formall voting or lite. But to that, first, although it might bee replyed in a word, that the care of

placing seates was onely in the Magistrates hands of the Burghe, where the said Assembly was kept, and that the neglect thereof, if any was, cannot be thought purposely done▪ yet because no diligence was omitted on the part of the Magistrates, and the seates conueniently enough placed according as the house could beare, wherein the said meeting was kept; wee must thinke this complaint proceeds of too much pride and sawcinesse. The man cannot abide to heare of degrees in the Church, and places according to degrees; but he must haue patience. Presbyters must now content to sit and stand behind the Bishops, according to the degrees of the old Christian Councels; for the time of confusion is expired, and Church men must learne now to liue orderly. That there was not a lite for election of the Clerke, hee must remember that the dimission made by the former, was in fauour of Master Iames onely; and that the Assembly had not so much adoe to choose a Clerke, as to aduise, if they would accept him, in whose fauour the dimission was made. Concerning which point, the voyces of the most, that could bee obserued to bee present, being asked, enough was done for making good his reception in the place, specially considering the Commissioners to the Assembly were not then knowne, nor a roll made whereby to call them, that had voyce particularly. But this is his curiositie, who gladly would find a fault, euen where none was committed.
            The said Master Iames Sandelands being admitted, command was giuen to all that had enteresse in the said Assembly, to giue in their commissions to him before the next sitting, and nomination was made of certayne for the Conference, according to the order kept in other Assemblies; in which besides the Bishops, Noble men, Barons, and Commissioners of Burrowes, the most wise and learned of the Ministrie were named indifferently, without any respect had of their opinions and priuate inclinations.
            At this time it was moued by one, That the libertie of the Church might bee kept in the choosing of a Moderator;

which the Archbishop of Saint Andrewes repressed, saying to the proponer, That he did not expect him to be a troubler of the Church, and the businesse thereof; and that the Assembly was met within the bounds of his charge, wherein so long as he serued, he trusted none would vsurpe; at which he kept silence; and streight wayes arose another, who asked whether all the Noble men and Barons present should haue voyce, or not, and if the whole Ministers that were met there, should haue voyces also: The Archbishop of Saint Andrews answered, that the order obserued in former Assemblies should here be kept, and no Ministers haue voyce that lacked a commission: But as for Noble men, and Barons who were come thither vpon his Maiesties missiues, he trusted none there would denie them voyce, specially since in the Assembly that proceeded at Saint Andrewes, it was one of the reasons they made for differring the conclusion of matters, That none of the Noble men, or Barons were then present to assist the proceedings of the Church.
            It was desired also, that the Articles to bee entreated, might bee extended in such forme, as his Maiestie desired them to passe, and that some might be set apart to collect the reasons that should be proponed, for, or against the Articles, that the whole As
                  •
               embly might haue the cleerer information. To this it was answered, that the conference was to consider of these things, and what might serue best to prepare matters for the whole Assembly.
            It appeared, that their drift was to perturbe the Assembly with such motions in the beginning, therefore the Archbishop requiring them to keepe silence, commanded his Maiesties letter which was presented by Doctor Young Deane of Winchester, and directed to the Assembly, to be publikely read, the Tenor of which Letter wee haue thought meete here also to insert.
            
               
                  
                  His Maiesties Letter to the ASSEMBLY.
                  
                     IAMES Rex,
                  
                  
                     RIght reuerend Fathers in GOD, Right trustie Cousins, and Coumsellors, and others Our trustie, and welbeloued subiects, We greet you well: Wee were once fully resolued, neuer in Our time, to haue called any moe Assemblies there, for ordering things concerning the policie of the Church, by reason of the disgrace offered vnto Vs in that late meeting at S. Andrewes, wherein Our iust and godly desires were not onely neglected, but some of the Articles concluded in that scornfull, and ridiculous forme, as We wish they had beene refused rather with the rest: Although at this time Wee suffered Our selfe to be intreated by you Our Bishops, for a new Conuocation, and haue called you together, who are now conuened for the selfe-same businesse which then was vrged; hoping assuredly, that you will haue some better regard of Our desires, and not permit the vnruly, and ignorant Multitude, after their wonted custome, to ouersway the better, and more iudicious sort; An euill which we haue gone

about with much paines, to haue amended in these Assemblies, and for which purpose according to God
                        •
                      Ordinance, and the constant practise of all well gouerned Churches in all ages, Wee haue placed you that are Bishops, and ouerseers of the rest in the chiefest roomes. You pleade much, Wee perceiue, to haue matters done by consent of the Ministers, and tell Vs often, that, what concernes the Church in generall, should be concluded, by the aduise of the whole, neither doe Wee altogether dislike your purpose: for the greater consent there is amongst your selues, the greater is Our contentment. But We will not haue you to thinke, that matters proponed by Vs of that nature, whereof these Articles are, may not without such a generall consent be enioyned by Our authoritie: This were a misknowing of your places, and withall a disclayming of that innate power, which We haue by Our calling from God, by the which, We haue place to dispose of things externall in the Church, as We shall thinke them to be conuenient, and profitable for aduauncing true Religion amongst Our Subiects. Therefore let it be your care by all manner of wise, and discreete perswasions to induce them to an obedient yeelding vnto these things, as in dutie both to God, and Vs, they are bound: And doe not thinke, that

We will be satisfied with refuses, or delayes, or mitigations; and We know not what other shifts haue beene proponed; for Wee will content Our selues with nothing, but with a simple, and direct acceptation of these Articles in the forme by Vs sent vnto you, now a long time past; considering both the lawfulnesse, and vndeniable conueniencie of them for the better furthering of pietie and religion amongst you. And it should haue rather becommed you, to haue begged the establishment of such things of Vs, then that We should thus neede to be put to vrge the practise of them, vpon you. These matters indeede concerneth you of the Ecclesiasticall charge chiefly. Neyther would Wee haue called Noble-men, Barons, and others of Our good Subiects, to the determining of them, but that We vnderstand, the offence of Our people hath beene so much obiected; wherein you must beare with Vs to say, That no Kingdome doth breed, or hath at this time, more louing, dutifull; and obedient Subiects, then We haue in that Our natiue Kingdome of Scotland; and so if any disposition hath appeared to the contrarie, in any of them, the same We hold to haue proceeded from amongst you. Albeit of all sorts of men, yee are they, that both of duetie were bound, and by particular benefits obliged, to haue

continued your selues, and by your sound doctrine and exemplarie life, kept others in a reuerend obedience to Our commaundements. What, and how many abuses were offered Vs by many of the Ministrie there, before Our happie comming to this Crowne, though We can hardly quite forget, yet We little like to remember. Neither thinke We, that any Prince liuing could haue kept himselfe from falling in vtter dislike with the Profession it selfe, considering the many prouocations that were giuen vnto Vs; But the loue of God, and his truth still vpheld Vs; And will by his grace so doe vnto the end of Our life: Our patience alwayes in forgetting, and forgiuing many faults of that sort, and constant maintaining of true Religion against the aduersaries (by whose hatefull practises We liue in greater perill then you all, or any one of you,) should haue produced better effects amongst you, then continuall resistance of our best purposes. Wee wish We be not further prouoked, and Gods truth, which you professe, of obedience vnto Principalities and Powers, bee no longer neglected, and slandered by such, as vnder the cloake of seeming holinesse, walke vnruly amongst you, shaking hands as it were, and ioyning in this their disobedience vnto Magistracie, with the vpholders of Poperie. Wherefore, Our

heartie desire is, that at this time, you make the World see by your proceedings, what a dutiefull respect and obedience you owe to Vs, your Souereigne Prince, and naturall King and Lord; that as We in loue & care are neuer wanting vnto you, so you in an humble submission vnto Our so iust demands, be not found inferiour to others our Subiects in any of our Kindomes; and that the care & zeale of the good of God Church, & of the aduancing of Piety, and Truth, doth chiefly incite vs to the following of these matters; God is our Witnesse: The which, that it may be before your eyes, and that according to your callings you may striue in your particular places, and in this generall meeting to do these things which may best serue to the promouing of the Gospel of Christ, euen our prayers are earnest vnto God for you; requiring you in this and other things to credit the Bearer hereof, our trustie Seruant and Chaplaine, the Deane of Winchester, whom we haue expresly sent thither, that he may bring vnto vs, a true relation of the particular carriages of all matters, and of the happie euent of your meeting, which by Gods blessing (who is the God of Order, Peace and Truth) we doe certainly expect; vnto whose gracious direction, wee commend you now and for euer. Giuen at Theobalds the 10. Iulij, 1618.
                  
               
            
            
               THis Letter being once read, and againe, as is the custome in all Letters of importance sent from his Maiestie: The Archbishop resumed the heads of the same, shewing how acceptable their acceptance would bee, and on the otherside, what inconuenients their refuse might bring vpon the Church; hee declared also vnto them, how they should bee well aduised before they thrust themselues wilfully in danger, because whatsoeuer forwardnesse, some amongst them seemed to haue for suffering in such cases, they should or long fore-thinke the same: and after they had tasted of the troubles of banishment a little, would, as others had done, seeke home againe▪ and acknowledge their ouersights. Of this he told them, they had examples many, not one before their eyes; and because the very night before he had receiued a Letter from Master Iohn Shairpe, who was exiled the Kingdome, for keeping that disordered Conuenticle at Abirdene: contayning an earnest request, to intercede with his Maiestie for libertie to returne into his Country, with assurance he would conforme himselfe to all good orders in time comming, hee made particular mention of him, and of the Letter, giuing the young man his due commendation for his good behauiour, and the profit hee had made in his Studies, since the time of his Banishment. Besought them to be wise, and not to commit any thing wherof afterwards they might repent, to the disgrace both of themselues and their Ministerie.
            This was the effect of his first speech, which the Libeller so depraues, as hee would make you thinke, that hee lackt both iudgement to conceiue, and dexteritie to vtter that which was meete to be spoken in such an audience; but they are witnesses enow to confute his folly, and falshood in that particular. The like imputation he goes about to lay vpon Doctor Young, the Deane of Winchester, whom in one place he cals a Scottishman by birth, as if he were now degenerated, and had forgotten, or forsaken his Countrey: And in another place scornfully taxeth, for the manner of his speech

whereas his affection to this Country and Church, his care for the good of both, and reputation he hath iustly purchased by his worthy parts, in the Church where now hee liues, deserued better, and other acknowledgement.
            It is true, that by reason of the trust, and credit committed to him, by his Maiesty in this businesse; the Archbishop of Saint-Andrewes desired him to speake, if so hee had any thing to say for seconding the Letter, whereof he was Messenger, and his words receiued at that time, by one that stood by, were these that followes.
            
               
                  MOst Honorable, most Reuerend, right Worshipfull, and dearely beloued: It might well become me, according to the example of Elihu in the Historie of Iob, in the presence of so wise, so graue, so religious, and learned an Assembly, to waite in silence till the more ancient in yeares had spoken: but that I know that the Souereigne Maiestie of our gracious Lord and Master the KING, who hath regarded so much the lowlinesse of his Seruant, as to send me vnto you at this time, to be the Messenger of his will and pleasure, now openly read in your eares, will procure attention vnto a few words, which shall be vttered with the vprightnesse and sinceritie of a heart wholy deuoted, as vnto the glory of God, & honour of our great Master the KING: so to the happy, free, and flourishing Estate of this Church and Kingdome, vnto which I am tyed by so many strong bands; that Moses the friend of God, and Paul that chosen Vessell of Christ, who are recorded in the holy Scriptures to haue exceeded in their affection to the people of Israel, their deare Countrey men, did not in that owe more vnto them, then that which you all wel know I owe vnto you; and would to God

I were as able to pay so iust a debt as I am, and euer shall be most ready and willing to acknowledge it; Hic amor meus pondus meum: for from this loue and dutie I owe vnto this place of my first and second birth (God hee best knowes) how the sorrowes of my heart, haue bin inlarged, since the time of the last generall Assembly at Saint-Andrewes, to heare such words of indignation, and iust displeasure, so often to proceed out of the mouth of so good, and so gracious a Prince, like MOSES the meekest man vpon the face of the Earth: Sed verendum etiam atque etiam quò exeat patientia tam saepe laesa: Words spoken against those that are called to be Ministers, Embassadors of Peace, and patternes of Pietie, and Obedience; vttered in the eares of them, who labour indeed as it becommeth, so loyall and louing subiects by their humble and dutifull obedience vnto his sacred Maiestie to out-strip those that went before them; and albeit they haue the last, yet not to haue the least portion in our DAVIDS loue. But as then with all good and well-affected men, I much grieued, so now I heartily reioyce and praise God, that notwithstanding of all that is passed, I haue liued to see this day a generall Synod once more of the Church of Scotland, called by the authority and expresse command and pleasure of our Souereigne Lord the KING, which is the only true and best meanes indeed, vsed in all Ages for extirpating of all Sects, Errors, & Heresies, & for the planting of truth, and good order in the Church of Christ. And I pray God▪ that all things at this meeting, may by the direction of Gods good Spirit, & by your wisdomes be so carryed, that you abridge not your selues and posterity, of so great
                        •
                     
                     
blessing, and procure that not only these things which are now required: but that other things more difficult bee enioyned and enforced vpon you, vpon strict penaltie by Supreme Authority. And therefore I desire (as I am sent to that purpose) with the Apostle Titus 3. to put you in remembrance, that you bee subiect to Principalities and powers, and that you bee obedient and ready to euery good worke: to put you in remembrance, that by the great blessing of Almightie God, you haue to doe with so wise, so potent, so religious, so learned a Prince, the matchlesse Mirror of all Kings, the nursing Father of his Church; that he whose Wisedome and Authoritie, is in the composing of all differences both Ecclesiasticall and Ciuill, so much required, respected, and admired, not only by his owne people of his other Kingdomes, but by all good Christians of forrein Nations throughout the Christian world may not seeme to be neglected by you his natiue Subiects at home, and you especially of the Ministerie, who ought to be examples and patternes of obedience vnto others; you whom he hath so infinitely obliged by his so great bountie and constant loue: To put you in remembrance, that as with no small disreputation vnto his Maiestie, and diminution as it were of his Princely authoritie in the iudgement and sight of the World, whose eyes are bent vpon these proceedings, he hath granted you so long time, by your Christian and godly endeuours with your seuerall flockes (whom you are to leade, & not to be led by them) to remoue (as you promised both to his Maiesty being here amongst you, and againe confirmed at your last generall Synod,) all those scandals which might be taken by the more ignorant and vnaduised sort of your people (to

whom all innouations though to the better, may seeme at the first somewhat strange:) so that now you would bee carefull, as much as in you lyeth, to take away that more dangerous and open offence, and scandall, which by your delay, and refusall of obedience, you shall cast vpon the sacred person of our Soueraigne Lord the King; the most constant, and Zealous Protectour and Defender of that Faith and Truth, which wee all professe, and for the which he hath suffered such open gaine-saying of the Aduersaries thereof, the limbes of Antichrist; as if he

                      Nation farre aboue all his Predecessours in the eyes of the World, now going about most of all to humble vs vnto our God, and in performance of the act of greatest deuotion according to his owne example to bring vs vnt

                      our Knees, did in so doing any way vrge his Subiects to any thing, which might sauour of Superstition or Idolatrie: To remoue the scandall from those who are in authority amongst you, and are set ouer you in the Lord, who by their dutifull obedience vnto God, and their Soueraigne, haue alreadie both by their Doctrine, and practise, commended those things which now are required of you, to b

                      both lawfull, and expedient: To take away that scandal and aspersion, which by the seeming reasons of your former refusall, or delay, you haue cast vpon others so glorious reformed Churches, as if the holy Ghost, and Spirit
                        •
                      reformation had beene giuen onely, and solely rested vpon you: To remoue that notorious, and publique scanda

                      which by the fierie and turbulent spirits of some fe

                      Professours of the glorious Gospel of Christ, as if the

also were disobedient vnto Magistracie, and in this did seeme to ioyne hands with the maine vpholders, and pillars of Poperie. It hath wounded the Spirits of good men to heare it often spoken, Nec dicatur, (vtinam ampliùs) Gathi, & in plateis Aschelonis; Nay to see it in Print, that Herod, and Pilate, were now reconciled againe, if not Contra Christum Dominum, yet contra Christum Domini. Lastly, to preuent that lamentable miserie and calamitie, which God in his iustice might bring vpon this Church, in that you regarded not the blessed time of your visitation, and despised the long suffering and great goodnesse of God, and of so bountifull and gracious a Soueraigne. And so to conclude, (for to stand now vpon the particulars were but actum agere, and you need no gleanings after so plentifull an haruest, or the light of a Candle being inlightned by the cleare beames of the Sunne,) with that of Naamans seruants, 2. King. 5. vnto their Lord, and Maister: Father, if the Prophet had commanded thee a greater matter, shouldest thou not haue done it? &c. So, right reuerend Fathers and Brethren in Christ, if our most gracious Soueraigne Lord, who hath done so much for you, had commanded you greater things, so long as they might stand with the will of God, and in no waies be repugnant vnto the same, (for in that case indeed, the Apostles rule holds inuiolably true 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , That we must rather obey God, then men) should you not haue beene readie your selues, and by your Doctrine, and practise, haue induced others to obedience? much more then, when he requireth of you, but these few necessarie things, necessary, and expedient for the glorie of God, for the aduancing of

pietie amongst you; for the honour and due satisfaction vnto our Soueraigne Lord the KING; for the happy establishing of order, peace, vnion, and loue amongst your selues, and in these vnited Kingdomes. Therefore let me beseech you in the bowels of Christ to giue all their due, Quae Caesaris, Caesari, quae Dei, Deo. And as Constantine the Great, (as Eusebius hath it) wrote vnto his Churchmen, that troubled his peace and other weightie affaires, with their contentious humours: So let me intreat you in the behalfe of our CONSTANTINE, Qui dum regat, iubet, Date illi dies tranquillos, & noctes curae, & molestiarum expertes, That so he may with much ioy and contentment of heart, yet once more, as hee proposeth, if not often, visit your coasts and those places which his soule so loueth. And that this poore Church, and his natiue Kingdome, may be made euer more and more happie by his comming, and long, peaceable, and prosperous reigne: And GOD and Men say Amen vnto it. Amen, Amen.
                  
               
            
            This Speech hee deliuered most grauely, and with great affection, to the contentment of all good and wise men: And how falsly the Libeller charges him with bringing in the Puritane, and Papist; like Herode and Pilate, conspiring together, we leaue it to the Reader to iudge. Thus ended the first Session of that Assembly.
         
         
            
            The second Session of the Assembly was differred to the morrow after, and the Conference warned to meet at three of the clocke in the afternoone.
            
               IN the Conference, after Prayer made for a blessing to that meeting, his Maiesties Letter was read againe, to put them in minde that were conuened of the businesse in hand, at what time the Archbishop of Saint-ANDREWES did remember them of the proceedings that had beene kept in these matters since his Maiesties first Proposition of them at Saint-ANDREWES: The promises made at that time to his Maiestie for passing the said Articles: the delay made in the preceding Assembly vpon pretext of satisfying the simple and ignorant sort touching the lawfulnesse of them: Hee told them also of the offence which his Maiestie had taken at that delay: the seuererer course that was intended against the disobedient Mininisters: and the mitigation which was procured by the humble intercession of himselfe and others: and hereupon besought them earnestly to doe, as became wisemen; for howbeit as he perceiued against the aduice giuen in the particular Synods they were come thither almost all of them, who were disposed to resist the conclusion intended, and that they supposed to carry matters by voyces without regard, what reason would craue of them, they would deceiue themselues in that case, and finde their numbers too weake, if they did not hearken, and submit themselues to reason. And in the end, shewing them the end of their sitting apart was to consider, by what meanes matters might most easily be brought vnto a point, hee said that there appeared but two wayes, one whereof was by disputing the Articles,

which was likely to consume a long time, and breed irritation, rather then any contentment else: The other was by a calme and wise consultation to consider how the said Articles might bee receiued in all the Churches with least offence, and conclude the same; specially since they had promised in the last Assembly to resolue themselues and others, of the equitie of the points required; and which they like best, he desires them to choose.
            The greater part esteeming, that such as were contrary minded, would neuer receiue satisfaction, vnlesse matters were first reasoned: and that it should bring a sore imputation vpon the Assembly to conclude any thing, which had not beene first debated by arguments, vrged the disputing of the Articles, which was of the rest condescended vnto. Then it being proponed, if they would take the said Articles in order, or beginne with the most controuerted, they agreed vniformely to treate of kneeling at the receiuing of the holy Sacrament in the first place, hoping that satisfaction being giuen in that Article, the lesse scruple should be made of the rest.
            So according to the order, two were named to dispute that Arcicle, to wit, Doctor Henrie Philip, and Doctor William Forbes for the one side; and Master William Scot, and Master Iohn Carmichael for the other: these two last named, after a graue protestation made, of their vnwillingnesse to be heard opposing to any matter, for the which his Maiestie seemed so earnest, excused themselues by the necessity of the Commandement, and their owne resolutions, which they held to bee well grounded, wishing that no offence might be taken at their speeches, which they should be carefull of, and say nothing, but with that reuerence which become them in so honourable an hearing. And then adding, that the contrary order had beene long time kept in this Church with great profit, and the comfort of many good Christians, if now any would preasse to abolish that which had beene in force, and draw in things not yet receiued, they

should bee holden to prooue, eyther that the things vrged were necessary and expedient for our Church: or the order hitherto kept, not meet to be retayned. And for this purpose they alleadged a passage of Master Hooker, in his Preface before the Bookes of Ecclesiasticall Policie, wherein hee craues that such as seeke the reformation of Orders Ecclesi
                  •
               sticall in the Church of England, should content themselues with the Opponents part, and bee subiect to prooue these two things mentioned. It was replyed, that the difference of their case and ours, was great: for there a few priuate men desired the Lawes publikely established to bee inuerted, and it was good reason that such should bee put to their confirmation of what they proponed: but heere the Prince, that by himselfe had power to reforme such things as were amisse in the outward policie, required to haue the change made. And therefore it concerned them to bring reasons, why his Maiesties Propositions ought not to bee granted. This they declined for a great while, still protesting the reuerence they beare to his Maiesties commandements; and without mentioning that which they would not oppose in Thesi, they wished this question to be reasoned: Whether kneeling, or sitting at the Communion were the fitter gesture.
            
            It was answered that the question could bee no otherwayes proponed then thus; His Maiestie desires our gesture of sitting at the Communion to be changed into kneeling: Why ought not the same to be done? If it could bee shewed by the Word, or by any necessary consequent deduced out of the same, that his alteration craued, ought not to bee granted, because impious or vnlawfull, that should bee enough humbly to decline the desire; which wee doubted not his Maiestie would accept well: and if otherwayes, they could bring no argument to the contrary, a necessitie lay vpon vs to obey.
            An houre, or more was spent in such speeches, they declining still to giue any argument, and offering themselues to answere such reasons, as any man would propone for the

               
                  〈1 page duplicate〉
               
               
               
                  〈1 page duplicate〉
               
               
alteration desired: whereupon the Archbishop of Saint-Andrewes said, that if none would reason, hee would put the Articles to voyces.
            Then they proponed that reasoning should bee publike, and in face of the whole Assembly: it was replyed, that nothing should be in conference concluded to the preiudice of the Assembly; alwayes matters must first be brought to some point in the conference, and thereafter proponed to the whole number, who should be heard to reason of new, if he listed.
            Hereupon they resolued to fall into the dispute, and first Master Iohn Carmichael brought an Argument from the custome and practice of the Church of Scotland, which had beene long obserued, and ought not to bee altered, except the inconuenience of the present order were shewed, and the desired gesture qualified to bee better. It was answered, that how euer the Argument held good against the motions of priuate men, yet his Maiestie requiring the practice to be changed, matters behoued to admit a new consideration; and that because it was the Prince his Priuiledge, that had the conseruation and custodie, aswell of the Church, as of the Common-wealth, to call in question Customes and Statutes which he perceiued to breed any inconuenience in the state euen by himselfe, it could not bee denyed that in a Church Assembly, such as that was, his Maiestie might lawfully craue an innouation of any Church Rite, which hee esteemed not to be conuenient for the time.
            From this Argument, they went to another of Christ and the Disciples sitting at the first institution, in discussing whereof, they were brought to acknowledge the gesture not to bee of the essence of the Sacrament, but alterable at the discretion of the Church. Only they held the custome formerly receiued to be the better.
            This was the proceeding of the first Conference, wherein because matters could not be brought to any point, continuation was made to the morrow after, and they warned to

meete againe at eight of the clocke in the morning. The Libeller affirmes the Propositions made by them touching the order of dispute, and the rest to haue beene reiected by the Moderator, adding, that he determined by himselfe; and that the fewer Reasons proponed by the Ministers, were cut off by cauilling and quarrelling at mens persons: whereas a number are witnesses, and can well remember, that they were heard with patience, to alledge what they could, and answered in that which they proponed till themselues could say no more, and that nothing was done, but according to the custome kept in such cases in all Assemblies.
            
               Wednesday the 26. of August.
               THe Conference being met as was appointed, after inuocation of the Name of God, the Reasoners were desired to proceed where they had left the night before, and not to trifle time with speeches of small consequence; which was the effect of all the discourses the Libeller seemes to complaine of. The reasoning continued from eight vnto eleuen of the clocke. And when the whole Reasons proponed, by the two forenamed, were in the iudgement of all men satisfied, others were required, and had place giuen them to propone their Arguments also, which was done in good order, and with such modestie as could be wished.
               It were needlesse here to repeate the seuerall Arguments and Answers, seeing they are all in the Disputation subsequent at large set downe; onely where the Libeller sayes, That reasoning was cut off, and the Article of kneeling put to voyces: It is true, that norhing remayning to bee said more in that head then was proponed, the Archbishop desired these of the Conference, 
                     •
                  o giue their iudgement in the matter reasoned. They opponed, that the custome was not to vote in Conference any matter, before it were brought to the full Assembly, but it was proued otherwise by these

who had frequented the Assemblies, both of old and in the latter times; as likewise it was told them, that these Conferences resembled the meeting of the Lords of Articles in Parliament, where matters are accustomed to bee prepared and put in order, before they bee proponed to the whole State. And that the voting in Conference was by way of aduice onely, and not to determine: The power whereof belonged onely to the Assembly. This being acknowledged by the whole number to bee so, they offered that were present, to giue their owne iudgement without preiudging the Assembly; as accordingly they did: The whole number, some ten or eleuen excepted, declaring that by the Reasons proponed, or any thing else they conceiued, they could not deny, but a change might bee made of the gesture in receiuing the holy Sacrament, and that it seemed to them conuenient for the Church to embrace the Article proponed by his Maiestie about kneeling, in regard of his desire and resolution to haue the same forme here established.
               The Libeller either forgetting himselfe or misse-informed (for by the whole Narration he makes, it would seeme, hee was not present himselfe) casts this in the after-noones Conference, though the same was done in the morning; but this, any man may well thinke, is but a light errour, yet it may appeare by this, how little the Narration he makes is to be regarded; for he brings in the Moderator in that afternoone, saying to such as conuened, That the Article of kneeling was concluded by the Conference: and immediately after sayes, That the same was put to voyces; where it is strange, the Moderator should so forget himselfe, as to say a thing was voted, and incontinent propone the same to bee voted againe, but this we will passe. After the aduice concluded to bee giuen to the Assembly in this point, it was thought meet, that the Article presently reasoned, with the other Articles proponed by his Maiestie, should all of them be formed in the best and most agreeable words that could bee deuised, for remouing all offence that might bee taken at

the same, and no aduantage giuen to the Aduersaries of the Truth; and to this effect were named some graue and wise Brethren, who were desired to haue the same in readinesse at foure of the clocke in the after-noone; it being thought meet, that the full Assembly should not meet before Thursday againe, at which time all might be prepared.
            
            
               Wednesday at after-noone.
               ALbeit the meeting of the full Assembly was differred to the next day, yet that after-noone, the whole number thronging in, whether that they were not aduertised of the delay, or that they desired to bee present with the Conference, came thither; which the Archbishop perceiuing, he tooke occasion to excuse the delay of meeting with them, declaring how farre they had proceeded, and that the Conference had committed the Articles to bee formed, vnto certayne Brethren, who were at that time to present them; and therefore desired they should haue patience till the morrow, and leaue the Conference for that time by themselues, which they did.
               How soone they were remoued, these who were appointed to forme the Articles, being inquired what they had done, answered, That they had formed the Article about kneeling, but had no leisure to consider of the rest; This being read, which they had put in forme, was well liked of, and they required to haue the rest in readinesse at the time of the Assemblies meeting the next day.
               The Libeller here remembers a word that escaped the Moderator, while as they resisted so importunately the voting of the Articles in Conference, saying, That hee would commit twentie preiudices to please the King: whereas the truth is, that after many answers made to giue them satisfaction, and shew that no preiudice was either intended or done to the Assembly, when as nothing could content them,

but still they talked of preiudice, he willed them to be quiet; for rather then his Maiestie should offend with the Church, and these troubles come vpon it, which were iustly to bee feared, hee would commit twentie such preiudices as these were.
               The rest of that after-noone was spent in talking, as the Libeller sayes, vpon Simony, &c. but in the deuising some ouerture for the restrayning of that abuse, to bee proponed to the whole Assembly, which the next day after was by vniuersall consent allowed: As likewise, the Commission for the planting of the Church of Edinburgh, and the forming of the booke of Common Prayers, and extracting of the Canons of the Church. And thus ended this Conference.
            
            
               Thursday the 27. of August.
               THat day being an ordinary day of preaching, a Sermon was made by the reuerend Father in God William late Bishop of Galloway, against which the Libeller excepts three manner of wayes; First, saying that his Doctrine was farre contrary to that which he had taught before the Estates of Parliament Anno 1606. Secondly, that hee set at nought, the ancient order of our Church, sometime highly commended by himselfe, extolling the new light; and thirdly, that he presumed to teach them a new kind of Catechisme, vnder whom he himselfe might be yet catechised. To all which seeing he is now at rest, this much may be truely replyed in his behalfe, That howeuer his opinion in these matters of the externall gouerment were sometimes other, his Doctrine was neuer contrarie to that, which at any time he professed, and preached: but these men haue beene so accustomed in feeding the eares of people with matters belonging to order, neglecting the substantiall points of Religion, which are, Faith and Repentance, as they dreame of no other Doctrine but that; and counts the alteration of iudgement in these

points of outward discipline a sort of Apostasie, and falling from the truth. And where he is said to set at nought, the ancient order of our Church, it is a false and impudent lye, for neither he, nor any else, that seeme most earnest for receiuing these Articles, did euer contemne the orders, and rites formerly established, but while as they stood in force, reuerently practised them, and were obedient to the ordinances of the Church made thereabout; but the circumstances of things now being changed, and these times requiring other fashions and manners, wee thinke without the despising of these, they may be well admitted, and as commendably vsed, as euer the other were: For the third, of presuming to teach them, by whom he might be catechized, because this is spoken in despight, I passe it with this answere, That his Sermons, and workes left behind him, which will continue with the posteritie, will witnesse against all their malice, that hee was inferiour to none of the Opposites in preaching, yea, in many degrees superiout to them all.
               But to returne to our purpose; the Assembly being not in full number, to take some conclusion in the businesse, for which they were conuened, after inuocation of the Name of God, it was declared vnto them, that by the labours of the Conference in their priuate meetings, the Articles proponed by his Maiestie, were brought and reduced into that forme, as it rested for the Assembly to consider, whether or not, the same should be receiued in our Church; and to moue them the rather to condescend, his Maiesties resolution, to haue the Articles receiued, was declared, and how no other answere could satisfie, but granting of the said Articles. They were likewise remembred of their promises made to his Maiesties selfe at Saint Andrewes and in the last generall Assembly, and had the lawfulnesse, and indifferencie of these matters at length of new exponed vnto them: Neither was any of their common pretexts left vnanswered, place being giuen to all, that would reason against any one of the Articles, to doe the same. And while some of them

insisted by long speeches to haue a continuation made of matters to another Assembly, and a supplication sent to his Maiestie for some longer delay, his Highnesse Commissioners hauing vrged a present answere, they were desired to cease, and not to trifle time, with vnnecessary speeches, seeing matters should receiue decision before they went forth of doores.
               And so some few making shew to reason in the contrary, were permitted to speake, till they had no more to say, and had their reasons answered to the full. The Libeller sayes, the libertie was granted to a few, and that the reasons were checkt, and borne downe with authoritie; but how contrarie this is to the truth, wee leaue it to bee answered by such as were present. And now when they haue set downe in writing▪ all that then was said, or possibly they can inuent, Let the Reader iudge, if by the answeres giuen, their obiections be not sufficiently confuted.
               
                  Doctor Lindsay his answere, being posed on conscience to declare his iudgement touching kneeling at the Sacrament, is maliciously mutilated: His declaration was this, as all the Assembly can testifie, in whose presence it was giuen: On my conscience I neither know Scripture, reason, nor antiquitie that enforceth kneeling, sitting, standing, or passing, as necessary, but thinke them all indifferent, and therefore that any of them may bee lawfully vsed, when it is found expedient. And considering nothing to be more expedient for the weale of our Church, then to keepe peace with our gracious Soueraigne, and not to contend for such matters, I iudge, yeelding to his Highnesse desire, to bee the onely best.
               When all the reasoning was ended, his Maiesties Letter was againe read, to the end the Assembly might see his earnestnesse about the same matters. And because of a Pasquill cast in, in the Pulpit of Edinburghe the Sunday before, which was deliuered to the Archbishop of Saint Andrewes, the penners whereof had warned the Ministers not to yeeld

to the Articles, giuing them promises of satisfaction for their stipends, in case they should be taken from them, and to fight in the defence of thē, & that cause: He disswaded them to leane vnto such suggestions, or be moued with them, for that they would proue nought in the end, as the experience of the seuenteene dayes worke might teach them. And added, which he is not ashamed of, nor will denie, That were there no other to take imployment against these Mutiners, and seditious persons, he could wish, that he were honoured therewith.
               These are the great blasts, and 
                     •
                  errours, which the Libeller mentions; otherwaies they can take exception at nothing iustly that then was vtttered.
               As matters were then proponed, to be voted, one of that number gaue in writing some particular reasons, for disswading the grant of the said Articles, which they haue now writ, and imprinted in this Pamphlet; which beeing suspected, as the Libeller speakes, to be some seditious protestation, the Preferrer thereof was aduertised to take heede to his doing, and giue in no Libels, which hee did not set his hand vnto: This while he offered himselfe to doe, the Archbishop of Saint-Andrewes beeing loath to bring him that way in danger, tooke backe the said Writing, and desired the Clerk of the Assembly to reade the same: And when they were perceiued to containe no matter of moment, or any new thing, which had not beene before talked of, they were cast by, as not deseruing any consideration.
               Thus the question was made, Whether they would receiue or refuse the Articles. Here the Libeller peruerts the question, and sayes it was this, Whether yee will consent to the Articles, or disobey the King? which is a question of his own deuising; And could not agree, neither with the matter, nor with the persons. It was desired by some, That the Articles might be seuerally voted, pretending that many would agree to some of them, who would not accept of all: But that no subterfuge might be left or giuen to those that gladly would

hang betweene parties, & striue to please all, it was thought meetest to vote them in Cumulo, because the denying of one, would be to his Maiestie, as the denying of all.
               The Archbishop of S. Andrewes taking the roll of names in his owne hand, as it was meete, he should doe, though the Libeller thinke otherwise, (for the office of the Clerke is to marke the voices, where they agree, or disagree, which he cannot easily doe, as any may may judge, if he himselfe reade the Roll; neyther is that customable in any iudicatorie consisting of so many persons, as did this Assembly) And called the names as they stood in the roll, where they were found 86. that answered affirmatiue, granting to the said Articles; and one and fortie onely that denyed, with foure non liquets. The Libeller sayes, That some were called, who wanted Commission, in which he impudently lies, their Commissions being extant in the rolls: And that others hauing Commission of whose Negatiue wee were assured, omitted to be called, whereas not any of the whole, was left vnasked. Maister Iohn Murray, Minister at Dumfermline, excepted, who was past by, for many reasons concerning himselfe, not needfull here to be expressed.
               As for the order kept in calling of the Roll, it merits no answere: And where it hath been said, That the Noblemen, Barons, and Burgesses, were those that swayed the voices, the most of the Ministrie beeing against it; by the rolls yet extant it is cleare that the whole Laicks that came to this Assembly were 31. of whom two were negatiues as the Libeller confesses, and one departed from the Assembly before the voting; which whole number being laid aside, they were ouerswayed by the voyces of the Ecclesiasticks to the number of eighteene at least.
               And this is the true Narration of all the Proceedings in the said Assembly, by which, let any man judge of the Libellers Discourse, and how little credit is to bee giuen to the same: For things are yet fresh in the memorie of such as were present, and cannot be forgotten.

               THe generall Assembly hath vsually met since the reformation of the Religion, according to the indiction of time and place made by the former Assembly; And if it happened, that any Assembly was to be holden pro re nata, premonition was made in due time by his Maiestie, and the Commissioners of the Church, and the occasions set downe expresly; to the effect Commissioners might be sent instructed according to the qualitie of the businesse to be intreated. Neuerthelesse, after diuers reports giuen out by such as stand in credit in Church affaires, that his Maiestie was so incensed against the last Assembly holden at S. Andrewes, that there was no hope of any other Assembly. This Assembly beyond expectation was proclaimed to be holden within twentie dayes after the Proclamation made at the Market crosse of Edinburghe, without any aduertisement giuen to the Presbytries about the matters to be handled.
            
            
               ANS.
               In this Assembly concurred all these things which yee require for the lawfull indiction of an Assembly: first, it was indicted by the supreme Magistrate, who hath sufficient power to conuocate generall Assemblies, and without whose permission no such conuocations can be made. Secondly,

it had the consent of the former generall Assembly at S. Andrews, which by a petition to his Maiestie, most humblie required to grant a new Assembly, wherein these matters might be more fully considered, referring the time, and place to his Maiesties pleasure. Thirdly, the premonition was made in due time; first, because at Easter before in the particular Diocesian Synods, aduertisement was made to the Brethren to haue their Commissioners in readinesse against the time to be designed by his Maiestie. Secondly▪ the time designed after the Proclamation, was sufficient to haue all the parts of the Countrie aduertised. Thirdly, the Bishops besides the said Proclamation, gaue lawfull aduertisement by their Letters to the Ministers of their Diocesse. Fourthly, the occasion, and matters to be handled, were well enough knowne to all long before. For the occasion was by that petition made by the Assembly at S. Andrewes, wherein the same matters beeing handled, though not fully discussed, it was required, That it would please his Maiestie to accept of a delay, and to indict another Assembly; to the end, that the Brethren hauing better leisure to consider the Articles proponed, they might bee the better prepared to giue his Maiestie satisfaction.

               The act of Chapters of old were void, and of none effect, when the meanest member hauing vote, was neglected, contemned, or not lawfully warned: Such like the act of prouinciall Synods, when the meanest Suffragan was not regarded with lawfull citation, according to the rule, Cōtemptus vnius pl

Neuerthelesse, for lacke of lawfull warning, and conuenient space to prouide, and prepare Commissioners, there was absent from that Assembly foure Dioceses, viz. Orknay, Caithnes, Argile, & the Isles; besides diuers Presbytries, whose interest was as proper and necessarie in the generall Assembly, as of any suffragan in Synod, or particular member in the Chapter.

               None was contemned that had enterest to bee there, because due premonition was made to all, as it is cleered by the answere to the former exception, albeit some were absent, it shewes not that they were neglected; for first, the absence might haue happened for diuers other occasions, some being impeded by sicknesse, some vnwilling to trauell in that Season of the yeare, and some loath to vtter themselues in the matters questioned. Secondly, the absence of these makes not the Assembly null; for from these farre distant High-land Countreyes, as Orknay, Caithnes, Argile, and the Iles which are heere mentioned, few Commissioners were euer accustomed to come to any Assembly heretofore; and to many Assemblies none of these Countreyes come at all: yet their absence did not annull the Assemblies. But in this Assembly there were at the least the Bishops of the Dioeeses, who might suffice to answere for the whole; one only excepted, who was absent, not for lacke of aduertizement, but because of disease. Thirdly, if we looke to ancient generall Councels in the Primitiue Church, we shall find, that the absence of Bishops or their Commissioners, who remayned in Countreyes farre distant from the place where the Councell was holden, did nothing derogate from the lawfulnesse thereof: as for example, in that first famous Councell of Nice, there were present three hundred and eighteen Bishops, yet out of all the Occidentall Countreyes, there are only named in the Catalogue sixteene Bishops, and two Presbyters Commissionaries for the Bishop of Rome; to wit, out of Spaine, one; out of Egypt, eleuen; out of Calabria one; out of Dalmatia one, out of Carthage one, and out of France one; so, in the first generall Councell at Constantinople, there were numbred an hundred and fiftie Bishops, whereof only two or three are found to be out of all the Occidentall Nations: In the first Councell of Ephesus, there are numbred two hundred Bishops, and only three out of the Occident. In the Councell of Chalcedone were three

hundred Bishops, whereof, of the Occidentall Countreyes only foure, or fiue. In the second generall Councell of Constantinople, an hundred sixtie fiue Bishops, and of these only ten or eleuen out of the Occident. Now albeit in the Occidentall Empire there were many large Kingdomes and Prouinces wherein Christian Religion was professed, yet these Councels (notwithstanding the absence of such) ceassed not to be acknowledged as generall: or if this might be esteemed a iust cause to annull a Church Assembly, what a doore should be opened to the Arrians, Macedonians, Nestorians, Eutychians, to reiect the Decrees of these famous Countreyes, by the which their Heresies were condemned? Lastly, the obedience giuen by the Pastors of these Dioceses, which you alledge to haue beene neglected, testifieth their consent to the Acts, and that they haue ratified them for their owne parts.

               The generall Assembly, the highest Iudicatorie Ecclesiasticall within this Realme, hath euer after exhortation made by the last Moderator, lited, and lawfully elected a new Moderator according to diuers Acts, continuate Custome and Practice of this Church. The which Presbyters haue beene so regarded, that the conuention holden at Perth by his Maiesties missiue the last of Feb. 1596. although frequented by his Maiesties presence, with a great number of the Nobilitie, Barones, and Burgesses, with the Commissioners from euery Presbytery, was for the defect aforesaid no further acknowledged to bee a lawfull Assembly, then the generall Assembly holden at Dundy the yeare following, 1597. declared the same to be a lawfull extraordinary Assembly. Neuerthelesse no Moderatour was lawfully elected in this Assembly, but the place vsurped by him, who had practised against the matter there proponed, and not as yet determined; and consequently who ought to haue beene secluded from any authoritie, in respect of the preiudice committed by him.
            
            
               
               ANS.
               In this, as in all the rest almost of their exceptions against the Assembly, there is a false rule laid, whereby to try the lawfulnesse thereof: To wit, the Acts and Custome of the Church of Scotland vnder Presbyteriall Gouernment, which must not rule vs now, seeing the true forme of Church-gouernment now restored is much different from the estate of these times. It is true, that when the Church was gouerned by a paritie of Ministers, they choosed a Moderator by suffrage, though without any warrant or example, eyther out of Scripture or Antiquitie, but being compelled thereto of necessitie in regard of that forme of Gouernment, wherein no man had any ordinary prerogatiue aboue, or before others: but now the forme of Gouernment being altered, and each man knowing his owne roome and station, we are not tyed to obserue that custome, but ought rather to follow the Constitutions and practice of the Primitiue Church, which was ruled by the same forme of Episcopall Gouernment that now is established in this Land. And it is manifest, that euer, while the Pope of Rome did tyrannically arrogate vnto himselfe and his Legats Presidencie in all Councels, this course was obserued, that eyther the Christian Prince himselfe, when he was present, was President, as Constantine the Great,
                     Sozom. l. 1. c. 9. Nic. l. 8. c. 14. 3. Tom. Con. 1. p. 6. in the first Councell of Nice, and Constantine called Pogonatus in the third Councell of Constantinople; or else by the Prince his permission and appointment, the Bishop Metropolitan, or Patriarch of greatest authoritie in these bounds, where the Councell was holden, who was alwayes acknowledged President, except he himselfe were indited or condemned of Heresie; then by the Emperours appointment, and not by Election of the Councell a President was appointed, as in the first Councell of Ephesus, Cyrillus Bishop of Alexandria was appointed President by Theodosius the Emperour: because both the Patriarchs of Constantinople and Antiochia, who were of chiefe authoritie in these bounds, were fauourers

of the Nestorian Heresie, which was there condemned. And if we looke through the whole Ecclesiasticke History, wee shall find this euer to haue beene the order; yea, in that Apostolike Councell, Act. 15. according to the iudgement of the most learned, both old and new Writers, the Apostle Iames was there President as Bishop of Ierusalem, Euseb

And so is it probable out of the Text, because hee pronounced the sentence in the conclusion of the action, which is the speciall dutie of a Moderatour, and according to the words of his sentence are the Synodicall Letters written to other Churches. This exception therefore of not lyting or electing a Moderator, being grounded vpon a Custome or Constitution now abolished, in the place whereof hath succeded, the commendable order alwayes obserued by the Primitiue Church in her purest times, is not to bee respected, and the example yee bring to qualifie this exception out of that Assembly at Perth, Anno 1596. is not only insufficient to proue, but likewise in many points false. First, because in the Acts of the Assembly, there is no mention made of any exception taken against the Election of the Moderator. Secondly, that Assembly was acknowledged to be a lawfull Assembly by an expresse Act in the same Assembly. Thirdly, it was called extraordinary, not for any exception taken against the Election of the Moderatour, but because of the time and place, to wit, that the time and place appointed by the former Assembly, was preuented vpon an extraordinary occasion by his Maiesties missiue. Fourthly, by the Assembly that followed at Dundy, Anno 1597. it is acknowledged to be a lawfull Assembly, without the addition of (extraordinarie) as appeares by the Acts thereof, Session 7.14.

Presbyteries, Burgesses, and Vniuersities, according to the Act made Anno 1573. Neuerthelesse the Bishops, a great number of Noblemen, and Barones, and some Ministers hauing no lawful Commission, presumed to carry themselues as lawfull members of the said Assembly.

According to the rule, Totum est maius sua parte: The Assembly is greater then the Cōference, & according to another rule, Turpis pars omnis, toti non congrua. It is an absurd Conference, that disagrees from the whole Assembly. Neuerthelesse in that Assembly some few named by the pretended Moderator not chosen by the Assembly, not only according

               Against the priuie Conference, there are foure exceptions made, first, that others were nominate then these who were lawfull members of an Assemblie. That this is false, shall bee cleered hereafter, when wee speake of the lawfull members of an Assembly. The second, that they were nominate by the Moderatour: to this I answere, hee vsed no other forme in the nomination of them, then hath beene heretofore vsed, in all other Assemblies; for the priuie Conference was neuer chosen by suffrages, but the Moderatour did nominate such of all parts of the Countrey, as were thought most meete, and so was done heere. In the yeere of God 1579. in an Assembly kept at Edinburgh, and another in Anno 1580. at Dundy, this forme of nomination beeing quarrelled, it was reasoned, voted, and concluded, that the Assessours of the priuy Conference should bee nominate by the Moderatour, and therefore in the next Assembly after the names of the Assessours, it is added, All these were nominate by the Moderatour. Thirdly, it is obiected that they disagreed from the whole Assembly. Answere. The euent prooued otherwise, for that which was thought good by the Conference was concluded by the whole Assembly. Fourthly, that the Conference tooke vpon them to reason, vote, and conclude matters: before they came to the Assembly. Answere. The end wherefore the priuy Conference is institute, is to prepare matters for the Assembly, by cleering the points by reasoning, declaring what in their iudgements and opinion was meetest to bee done, without preiudice of the Assembly it selfe, and so was it done in this priuie Conference.

               It hath beene the commendable care of godly Emperors, and their honourable Deputies in generall Councells, to prouide, that nothing bee done violently, nor extorted by terrour, but that time and libertie bee granted for reasoning vpon matters proponed; and that the Booke of God be laid open for finding out the Truth. Agatho writing to the Emperour Constantine, aduised him to grant free power of speaking to euery one, that desires to speake for his faith which he beleeueth and holdeth; That all men may euidently see, that no man willing or desirous to speake for the Truth, was forbidden, hindred, or reiected by any force-threatnings, terrour, or whatsoeuer else might auert them from so doing. Conforme to this aduice the Emperour answered as followeth: By God Almighty we fauour no partie, but shall keepe our selfe equall to all, no way making necessitie in any point. Neuerthelesse, in this Assembly, the necessitie of yeelding was inforced vnder no lesse pangs, then the wrath of Authoritie, imprisonment, exile, depriuation of Ministers, and vtter subuersion of the estate and order of this Church; such as by the prouidence of God had their mouthes opened to reason, were checkt, quarrelled, rebuked, boasted, interrupted; and for their discouragement, it was plainly professed, That neither the reasoning, nor the number of voters, should carry the matter away. The party defender was forced to pursue. The collecting and putting in order of the Reasons of either side, was refused.
            
            
               ANS.
               It is obiected here, That necessitie of yeelding was enforced, contrary to the example of Constantine, who protested he would 
                     •
                  auour no party, but keepe himselfe equall to all, no way making necessitie in any point. To this wee answer, first, The cause is different, for the question to be debated in that Councell of Constantinople, was a substantiall point of Doctrine in it selfe, not subiect to his Imperiall power, controuerted betwixt the Greeke and Latine Church, concerning

the twofold will in Christ: and because, hee being a Grecian himselfe, it might haue beene thought hee would fauour more the Greeke Church; therefore he purges himselfe of partialitie, referring the whole matter to the decision of the Councell according to the Scriptures: But here the question is, of no substantiall point of Doctrine, but of matters indifferent, not particularly determined by Scripture, but depending vpon the Prince, and Churches pleasure to haue them practised, or not. In which the Prince might by his owne authoritie impone a necessitie vpon all his Subiects to obey the same, except they could shew euident proofes out of the Scripture, that the same were absolutely vnlawfull. And in case of disobedience, hee might iustly threaten them by his authoritie. Yet all these particular terrours and threatnings (which yee mention) with the wrath of Authoritie, imprisonment, exile, depriuation, &c. were directed onely to such, as without reason should bee found obstinate and refractarie, who, by reason ought not onely be threatned, but punished. For if men will not regard authoritie, but doe as their conceit (which some falsly call conscience) leades them: if neither the Prince his command, nor acts of Synods, can bind them to obedience; may not these threatnings, yea, ought they not to bee vsed towards them, as it hath euer beene the practice in all Councels? And to meet you with your owne example, which yee alledge that same Constantine who protests, he would impose no necessitie in any point; in that selfe-same Synode, perceiuing the obstinacy of Macarius Bishop of Antiochia, and his followers, Stephanus, Polychronius, Constantius, and others: not onely threatned them bitterly, but likewise in presence of the Synode, presently caused to depriue Macarius of his Bishopricke, by taking his Episcopall cloake from him, and did cast him and his Associates forth of the Councell by the necks, Ceruicibus eijc
                        •
                     entes foras, as the words are. Vide Concil. Constantinop. 3. Act. 8.9, 15.16. & Binni Annotat. Then yee say, yee were threatned by the vtter subuersion of the

Estate, and order of the Church. And is it not lawfull to lay before your eyes the danger that may follow vpon your disobedience? for looke all the Letters and harrangues of the godly Emperours, the generall Councells, and such as were speciall persons therein; yee shall finde them euer lay before the eyes of such as were conuocated, as the speciall motiues, that might serue to induce them to condescend vnto things that were proponed, and serued to the good and peace of the Church. And to insist in the same example brought by your selfe, reade the Letter which Constantine writes to Agatho, and yee shall find the chiefe and onely Argument almost hee vses, to moue him to condescend to an agreement with the Greeke Church, is by laying before him the danger wherein the whole Church lyes by their dissention.

Finally, as to that yee obiect, That the party defendant was forced to pursue; It was not so, but the party refusing obedience was vrged to obey, or then giue sufficient reasons of their disagreement, which was most iust and equitable. For by one Statute made in the Assembly at Dundie, Anno 1597. 14 Maij, Sess. 7. it is ordayned, That hee that sustaynes the negation with his vote, shall giue rationem negandi. The rest of your Assertions are manifest lyes and calumnies: For all the Contradictors were heard with great patience the space of two dayes, both in

the priuy Conference and face of the Assembly, while they had no more to obiect.

               In free and lawfull Assemblies, priuate reasoning is not sufficient; but it is requisite, that there bee also free reasoning in publique, for the full information of all, who haue the right of voting: Neuerthelesse, in this Assembly, publique reasoning was hardly obtayned, it was not full and free to propone, and pursue with replyes.

               Publike reasoning was neuer refused, neither was any man hindered to speake freely, prouiding he spake pertinently, but onely by the Lawes of disputation the President comptrolled those who transgressed the Lawes, when either they reasoned not formally, or not to the purpose, or repeated arguments vnnecessarily, which had beene already sufficiently discussed; and this is the power of the Moderator by the Assembly at Saint Andrewes, Anno 1571. in March. But the falshood of this exception is cleared sufficiently, by the true Narration of the proceedings of the Assembly.
            
            
               PP.
               In all free and lawfull Assemblies, humble requests for mature deliberation in matters of great importance hath beene heard and granted, but in this Assembly humble supplication for continuation, till matters were more ripely considered, or till his Maiesties answer were returned to the Petition of the defenders of the established order, was peremptorily refused.
            
            
               ANS.
               If these matters had neuer beene proponed before, or if we had not knowne his Maiesties will by his Letters hereabout, perchance this exception might haue had some force, but seeing some of these Articles had beene discussed in an Assembly at Abirdene, and all proponed thereafter in an Assembly at Saint Andrewes, at the which time, the same request of continuation was proponed, and an humbly sute

sent to his Maiestie, to accept of this delay, to the end euery man might consider the matters more deeply, with promise, that if it would please his Maiestie to grant them leisure to aduise, and instruct their flocks in the lawfulnesse of these Articles, they should doe their best to giue his Maiestie satisfaction, a longer continuation could not be harkened vnto, especially since this Assembly was conuocated, to trie the effects of their promises; and that it was euident, how a number of them against their promise, were so farre from the instructing of their people in the lawfulnesse of the Articles, that in the contrary, they pressed most sediciously to stirre vp both their owne flocks and others to disobedience. So at this time, that proposition of continuation could not bee granted for three weightie reasons; first, because the former continuation was abused to the stirring vp of discontentment amongst the popular. Secondly, the Moderator, and the Commissioners, could not graunt it, because of his Maiesties peremptory declaration of his will, in his Highnesse Letter directed to the Assembly. Thirdly, because they perceyued by the disposition of the party, that a further continuance would haue serued for nothing, but to haue augmented the Schisme and diuision begun.

               Pope Leo excepteth against the second Councell of Ephesus called praedatorie, that Dioscorus who challenged the chiefe place, kept not priestly moderation, and would not suffer the Synodall Letters of the west to be read. In all free, and lawfull Assemblies good aduisements haue been heard, and followed; but in this Assembly some difficulties presented in writing to be considered, and remoued, before the voting were peremptorily reiected.
            
            
               ANS.
               That this reiection of these difficulties, is a iust exception against the lawfulnesse of this Assembly, yee proue it by the example of Pope Leo, who excepted against the second Councell of Ephesus called Praedatorie, because Dioscorus
                  
who was President there, would not suffer the Synodal Letters of the West to be read in the Councell, I will answere first to your proofe, and then to the matter it selfe. The reason yee vse is captious, for yee reason from a partiall cause to a totall rejection. The Councell of Ephesus was iustly reiected for diuers errours committed both in matter, and forme, yet yee choose onely one of the smallest, and applie it falsly to this Assembly. The errours in matter were, That first, it did approue hereticall doctrine, peruerting the grounds of our Faith. Next, it restored pernicious Heretickes alreadie condemned in a Councel at Constantinople, as Eutyches, and his followers; and condemned reuerend Fathers, for maintenance of the true doctrine, as Flautanus Archbishop of Constantinople, and others. The errours in the manner of proceeding were first, The Orthodoxe Bishops beaten by the souldiers, (whom Dioscorus had brought into the Councell) fustibus, & gladijs, with swordes and staues, whereby some dyed of their wounds receiued, others were bound with chaines, and others presently carried to prison. Secondly▪ the rest that remained were forced to subscribe a blanke paper, wherein Dioscorus wrote, whatsoeuer pleased him; these were the causes, why this Councell was called Praedatoria Synodus. It is true, The Pope of Rome alledged some other reasons for the nullitie thereof, wherewith he was more offended, because the same seemed derogatiue to his authoritie, as that the Synode was not conuocate by him, but by the Emperours commaund: His Legats were not admitted Moderators therein: And his Letters contayning his sentence and opinion were not publiquely read, but supprest. Yee, leauing all the rest of the weightier causes, chop onely at this, as if therefore onely, this Councell was reiected: And to make this Assembly at Perth odious, compares it with that hereticall and turbulent conuention, betwixt the which, there is no similitude at all, no not in the poynt which yee chop at: For the Libell ye speak of, was not peremptorily reiected, but a part of it being

read, the reading was interrupted for two causes; first, because it contained no new thing, but that which had beene alreadie heard, and sufficiently answered to. Secondly, because it contained some things, which could not but giue iust offence. The like was practised in that Councell vnder Constantine, and Agatho, which yee alledged before for a patterne of orderly proceeding: In the eleuenth Session therof, we find that certaine Libells of Macarius, who opponed himselfe to the Councell, being presented to bee read publiquely, after they had proceeded a while in reading, they reiected the rest, for that they contayned so absurd doctrine as would haue offended the eares of the hearers: And in the twelfth Session, other Libels presented by him, to the Emperour, and offered by the Emperour to the Synod, after a part thereof was begun to bee read, the Councell finding that they contayned no new reasons, but the same which had beene heard, and discussed before, they caused stay the reading thereof: So, in this Assembly, to reiect a Libell, foolish, and impertinent, could be no fault.

               If all men were alike peaceably disposed towards the weale and peace of the Church, there were no need of these meanes to draw them to their dueties; but seeing some are wickedly set, seeking nothing but disturbance, others pre-occupied

by their owne opinions; others abused, and seduced by the craftier sort, there is need sometimes to vse terrours, that the vnruly may stand in awe to offend, and the deliberations taken for the good of the Church, may not be hindered. As to the reading of his Maiesties Letter, directed to the Assembly, which the Libeller notes to haue been foure times read, and immediately before the voting of matters, to moue the Assembly, I would aske him, What is the fault? The Assembly was called by his Maiestie to giue answere to the Articles proponed by himselfe: His Letter contained a Declaration of his pleasure, and therewith diuers reasons, why the Church ought to condescend to his Highnesse desires: Such as opposed them, insisted still for a new continuation, and the delay of a long time. And it was needfull they should heare his Maiesties owne minde by his Letter, who otherwise could not consent vpon the answers twice giuen by his Highnesse Commissioners in that poynt. If the Letter should haue beene read at all the seuerall Sessions of the Assembly, there could be no fault in it, and I am sure the time had beene better spent that way, then in hearing many of their idle discourses. For I thinke in that short Letter, there be more good and solid stuffe, then is in all this long Libell of the Pamphleters; yet did it cost him many houres, and (as we heare) many nights and daies to find out these particulars, at which he might carpe. But I know it is not the consuming of time that troubles him: hee is sorie, That the Assembly did regard the Letter so much, and was moued any way by it, as he speakes. Now we tell him plainly, it was read to moue them to consent, and it wrought that, for which it was done: If any fault be, it is this, Their humours, and purposes, were crossed by the reading of the Letter, for we can see no more in it. Touching the terrours and threatnings breathed out by the Moderator of the Assembly, what they were, hath beene shewed in the Narration of the proceedings; for the marking of the names of those that should be dissenting, it is most false: They were warned

to speake in modestie, and abstaine from intemperate words, such as many of that sort are giuen to, when reason failes them: And if they should transgresse, warned of theit danger. But, that it was threatned to delate the names of the voters, howsoeuer they should giue their voyces, it is most vntrue. Yet is it nothing so vnusuall, as he would make it appeare, in Councels and Synods to threaten and terrifie such as are vnruly. In the first Councell of Chalcedon, Martianus the Emperour forbare not to threaten such as should shew themselues refractary against the Decrees of the Councell, and amongst the instructions giuen to his Commissioner Elpidius, and others, this is one, Si quem videritis conturbationi & tumultui s
                        •
                     udentem, hunc custodiae mancipate, & ad nostram perferte notitiam. Which in effect is, To marke their names, and to delate them to the Emperour. Many the like are to be obserued in the Bookes of the Councels. And if such speeches may furnish any exception for the nullitie of Councels & Assemblies, we shal hardly find a lawful Coūcel or Assembly at all. As to the Sermons, and harrangues, wherewith he said in his first exception, that the Assembly was preoccupied; I would gladly know what Church Assembly hath there euer beene kept witho
                     •
                  t Sermons and Harrangues? In the olde Councels they were not neglected. And if these be pre-occupations, how shall yee iustifie any Assembly kept from the beginning of our Church to this day? We haue heard by some of you at times, strange Discourses, and more strange Sermons made at your Assemblies, contayning bitter Inuectiues against his Maiestie, the whole State, and sometimes against the Ministers themselues. And then was i

And all that he spoke, was fathered vpon the holy Spirit. These were your formes, in former times, worthie of

reproofe. And diuerse of the Assemblies yee count to haue beene free and vncorrupt, if they were well tried, would for this cause be seene most worthy to be reiected.

Why they were voted in Cumulo, hath beene shewed in the

Neuerthelesse, in this Assembly, not onely were some past by, who were knowne resolued to vote negatiue: but diuers others also disposed to vote affirmatiue, were admitted, or rather brought in without commission.

               The Libeller giues vs a rule here, which his Inductions will not make good: and thinks, that because it was the custome while the Presbyteriall gouernment stood in force, that all Commissioners, at least of the Ministrie, should bee chosen by the seuerall Presbyteries, it should now bee so: But he must remember that sort of gouernment is changed, and now they must haue place in Assemblies, that are authorized by their callings to sit there: aswell as by their Commissions. When the Church was gouerned by Superintendents, these Commissions were not knowne; onely the Superintendents themselues, because of their place and preheminence, and such of the Ministers as they esteemed worthy to haue voyce in Assemblies, came thither: Now the Bishops on whom lyes the burthen of the Church affaires, haue place by vertue of their callings to sit, and giue voyce in Assemblies; and Ministers by cōmission from their Countries and Diocesses, because all cannot bee present, nor may the Parishes in the Country bee left destitute of their Preachers at once. This was the forme of the old Synods and Councells in the primitiue Church; and that first Synode of the Apostles was not otherwise held.

               It hath pleased his Maiestie, in former times, to send, but some few Commissioners in his Highnesse absence, to concurre with the Assembly, and to propone his Highnesse desire thereunto, &c. Neuerthelesse, in this Assembly, not only his Maiesties Commissioners, but also their Assessors gaue euery one vote, whereas his Maiesties selfe being present,

neuer claymed further then the power of one vote.

               Whatsoeuer his Maiestie in former times hath done, remitting of his owne right, for causes knowne to himselfe, should be no preiudice to his Royall priuiledges; especially amongst these that haue abused, and set themselues obstinately to crosse his Royall and iust designes. The practice of these famous Monarchs and Kings, who were in their times nursing Fathers of the Church, shewes that Princes are not tyed to any number of Commissioners, but as it seemes good to them, or as the businesse in hand requires, so they doe: Thus in the Councell of Chalcedon, where Constantinus Pogonatus (whom yee alleadged before for example of equitable proceeding) was present and President, there sate with him other thirteene Iudges and Senators, whose names are there expressed. And it is noted in euery Session almost they sate there, ex iussione Imperatoris, and had definitiue votes: Thereupon yee meet often with these words, Gloriosissimi ed
                        •
                     ount, & gloriosissimi Iudices dixerunt: In that famous Councell also of Chalcedon, called the fourth generall, there were present for Valentinian and Martian, the Emperours eighteene Commissioners, whereof sixe were Iudges, and twelue Senators, who, as it is most euident through the whole Acts, had the chiefe moderation of the Synode, and vote definitiue therein: Neither was this pluralitie of Commissioners receiued onely in generall Councells; but also in Nationall, as in the second Councell of Orangue, Anno 529. where together with the Bishops, ten Pretors and Counsellors of France sate, and subscribed the Acts, sent thither by the King. Likewise in the eight Nationall Councell of Spaine, holden in Toledo, Anno 653. there late and subscribed sixteene Dukes and Earles. In the twelft Nationall Councell of Toledo, Anno 681. conuocate by Eringius King of Spaine, together with the Bishops did sit the King himselfe, and vniuersi Seniores Palatij, The

Ancients or Senators of the Court, fifteene in number; of whom, in his speech to the Councell, hee sayes; Quos interesse huic Concilio, delegit nostra sublimitas. In the thirteenth Councell of Toledo, there sate, and subscribed sixe and twentie Dukes and Earles. In the fifteenth Councell thereof, there sate, and subscribed seuenteene Earles. In the sixteenth, there sate, and subscribed sixteene Senators, of whom the King sayes in his speech: Quos huic Concilio nostra sereni

                   I might bring a large Catalogue of examples; but these are sufficient to proue that which we haue in hand, to wit, that the number of Commissioners sent by his Maiestie, i
                     •
                   warranted by the practice of all good Christian Princes in most ancient Synods: yea, it is certayne, that Monarchs and Princes had euer these priuiledges, vntill that the Popes tyrannie increasing, did bereaue them of their right, and exclude them from all Church assemblies. And looke wee to the custome of our owne Church; many Counsellours and Noble men haue had vote in Assemblies in name of his Maiestie. In the Assembly holden at Edinburgh, Anno 1563. Decemb. 25. besides the Superintendents, Ministers, and Commissioners of the Churches, and Prouinces, there were present nine Lords of the Counsaile, Earles and Barons; and because thereafter, the Regent, his Counsaile, and Nobilitie, did not assist the Assemblies so frequently as before, an earnest Petition was made by the whole Assembly conuened in Edinburgh, Anno 1573. March 6. to the Regent his Counsaile, and Nobilitie, to giue their presence and concurrence with the Church in their proceedings, because such had beene the practice in Assemblies from the beginning of the reformation. The truth whereof is manifest by the inscriptions set before the Acts of many assemblies, wherein the Counsaile and Nobilitie are euer distinguished from Bishops, Superintendents, Ministers, and Commissioners of Prouinces and Churches.

In the generall Assembly holden at Edinburgh, Anno 1573. August 6. it was appointed, Sess. 1. as followes. Because it is vnderstood that certayne of the Nobilitie of this Realme, and secret Counsaile, are to repayre to this Assembly: Therefore these whole Brethren ordaynes, that the whole Nobilitie and Counsailors, with the Commissioners of Townes, Prouinces, and Churches, hauing power to vote, shall sit within the inner barre of the Tolbuithe, and all others without. In the Assembly holden at Edinburgh, Anno 1567. were present ten Earles, and Lords of Baronies about the number of three and fiftie, besides the ordinarie Commissioners of Townes and Churches. Likewise in the Assemblies holden, Anno 1563. Decemb. 25. Anno 1566. Iun. 25. Anno 1567. Iul. 21. Anno 1567. Decemb. 25. 1568. 1569. 1570. &c. the Earles, Lords, and Barons, are distinguished from Commissioners of Churches, Prouinces, and Townes. And in the Assembly at Edinburgh 1563. Decemb. 25. the Lords of secret Counsaile, with the whole Brethren of the Assembly, appointed Master Iohn Woodlocke, Superintendent of the West, Moderator. So as wee see the practice of our owne Church, hath euer esteemed this free, that his Maiestie at his pleasure, or Regents in his minoritie, should choose what number of Commissioners they liked.

               At Edinburgh in Iuly 1568. it was ordayned, that Barons should be chosen Commissioners in Synodall Assemblyes. At Dundie in March 1597. after the full establishment of Presbyteries, it was appointed in presence of his Maiestie, that Barons should be chosen Commishioners with consent of Presbyteries; and that one Baron onely should bee directed out of the bounds of a Presbyterie. Neuerthelesse in this Assembly the Noble men and Barons had neither Commission according to the old act, nor according to the new. In the yeere of God 1568. it was ordayned that Burgesses

should be chosen Commissioners by the Counsaile, and Church Session of their Burge coniunctly: And in the yeere 1597. that they should be chosen with consent of the Presbyterie: Item, that euery Burghe haue power to direct but one Commissioner, except Edinburgh, to whom it was permitted to direct two. Neuerthelesse in this Assembly neither of the said Articles were obserued.

               The acts alleadged, for choosing Commissioners of the Barons, and Burghes were neuer so precisely kept in our Church as to exclude any of them, that came thither without Commission from Presbyteries. But such regard was euer had to Noble men, and Barons of any note, that if they were present they had their places with the first, were allowed to giue their aduise, and voyce in euery matter proponed, and had thankes giuen them, that vouchsafed their concurrence; this is euident by all the Registers of our Assembly; and so well knowne, as none can deny it: It grieues the Lybeller, and the rest of that Sect, to see the Nobles, and Barons so ready at his Maiesties call; and that, that which sometimes serued them to good purpose in their tumultuous meetings, is turned against themselues to wound them.

               At Montrosse, 1600. it was statuted and ordayned, that none of them who shall haue vote in Parliament in the name of the Church, shall come as Commissioners to the generall Assembly nor haue any vote in the same, vnlesse they be authorized with Commission from their owne Presbyteries to that effect. This Act was neuer repealed, no not at the pretended Assembly holden at Glasgow; but by the same Assembly they stand countable to euery generall Assembly for their proceedings. Howbeit the Presbyteries were spoyled of their authority in many things at the said pretended Assembly. Yet of the power of election of Commissioners, they were not spoyled, neyther is there any other order of Election of Commissioners, and Constitution of the members of the Assembly set downe by any Act of our Church, then was established, Anno 1597. Neuerthelesse in this Assembly they not only presented themselues, without Commission, but sate as Lords ouer-ruling it; they had practised the Ceremonies against the established Laws, before they were proponed to the Assembly, they ought therefore to haue beene secluded, and sharply censured, but they vsurped the place both of Iudge and partie.

               This Act of Mōtrosse Assembly, was past when these caueats were deuised to restrayne the immoderate power of Bishops in the Church, and was yeelded vnto, for satisfying the importunity of such as opposed to their restitution, and keeping them quiet in the time: but the Bishops now beeing restored by the Assemblies of the Church, and by Acts of Parliament to the exercise of that lawfull power and Iurisdiction, which euer they had in the Church, that Act nor any other of that nature cannot preiudice them. And that Bishops should haue their Commissions from Presbyters men inferiour to them in degree, it is so absurd, as the like hath not beene heard in any Age. But the Libeller is in a dreame, and thinkes no Act, nor any order established to be

of force, that hee himselfe hath not approued. Where hee sayes, that there was neuer another Constitution of the members of the Assembly set downe by any Act of our Church, then that at Dundy, 1597. it is most false, for in Edinburgh, 1568. in Iulij, there is another Constitution, wherein the members of the Assembly are diuided in two sorts, some are appointed to bee ordinary, and perpetuall, as Superintendents, and Commissioners for visitation of Churches; others mutable, are Commissioners of Churches, Townes, and Prouinces; The first, needeth no speciall Commission to euery Assembly, but being once admitted to the Office, were euer acknowledged thereafter as ordinary, and speciall members of the Assemblies. The second, were changed from Assembly, and behooued to produce a new Commission, before they were admitted. Yea in the Assembly holden, Anno 1568. at Edingburgh the first of Iulij, it was ordayned, that no Minister should haue voyce in Assemblies generall, nor leaue their Parishes to attend thereat, vnlesse they be choosed by their Superintendents, as men knowne able to reason, and of knowledge to iudge in matters. But for the Bishops themselues, they haue alwayes bin reputed ordinary members of the Assembly, and were euer first called in the Rolles, as is to be seene through the whole Registers. In Anno 1563. Iul. 28. Sess. 4. it is ordayned that euery Superintendent should compeare the first day of the Assembly vnder such a paine, not as idle Spectators, but as hauing speciall interest and power; the same is euident by another Act at Edingburgh, 1568. Iulij 1. And by a third Act at Edingburgh in March, 1573. And by the admonition sent by the Regēt his grace, wherby the Bishops are specially admonished to be present at all Assemblies, or to be reputed vnworthy of the office. And in the Assēbly at Edinburgh, A. 1575. Aug. 6. albeit there were present sixe Bishops, to wit, Glasgow, Dunkeld, Galloway, Brechin, Dumbline, and the Isles, and two Superintendents, Angouse, and Lowthian; yet because certaine others were absent, it was thought good,

that they should be called, and the absents noted. Yea after, that the Iurisdiction of Bishops beganne to be quarrelled in the Assembly, 1579. Iul. 7. Sess. 9. this Statute was made that followes.
               
                  ABout the Bishops and Commissioners of Countreyes, who absent themselues from generall Assemblies at the time appointed, the Church hath ordayned the Act made, August 12. 1575. to be executed against them; and that same Act, to be vnderstood, not onely of Bishops, hauing office of Visitation appointed to them by the Church, but also of such as haue not the said office: Likewise, when some Bishops were prohibited to exercise the power of Visitation, their presence not the lesse was thought necessary in al Assemblies, and they counted ordinary members thereof; neither was that Statute euer repealed by any Assembly afterwards; but euen, Anno 1587. after the Prerbyteries were erected, the Bishop of Saint Andrewes was summoned to compeare for his absence from the generall Assembly; by all which it appeares, that the Bishops had no need of any commission for sitting, and giuing voyce in Assemblies.

               At Saint-Andrewes, in April 1582. It was thought expedient, that Presbyteries should not be astricted to send their Moderator in Commission, but whom they iudged fittest for the purpose: that constant Moderators should bee constant members of the generall Assembly, is a forged clause, forged in an Act of a pretended Assembly holden at Linlithgow, the yeare of God, 1606. The which Assembly, neyther the Church then did, nor will the Bishops now stand to; neuerthelesse in this Assembly, some Moderators of Presbyteries voted without Election, and only by vertue of the forged clauses of the Act fore said: if any Presbytery directed their Moderators in Commission vpon ignorance and errour, hauing respect to the fore-said clauses afore-said, their ignorance, and errour is no lawfull consent. It is in the meantime

to be remembred, that the present Moderators are not of the qualitie of these constant Moderators, but of a new Edition set out at Glasgow, viz. they are the Bishops Deputies, placed by them in Presbyteries.

               This reason will not inferre a nullity: Presbyteries (ye
                     •
                   say) were not astricted by the Act of Assembly at Saint-Andrewes, 1582. to send their Moderators in Commission; Ergo
                  ▪ the Moderators ought not to haue come, notwithstanding of their Commissions from the Presbyteries: there is no consequence heere: for it is, as if I would reason, The Presbytery of Saint-Andrewes was not astricted to haue sent Master Iohn Carmichael to the Assembly. Therefore he ought not to haue had voice therein, notwithstanding of his Commission. Any man sees the inconsequence. But here ye
                     •
                   adde foure things. First, that the Act of Linlythguow, 1606 bearing, that constant Moderatours should bee constant members of the generall Assembly, was forged. Next, that the Bishops will not stand to this Assembly now, more then the Church did at that time. Thirdly, that some Moderatours came to this Assembly without Election, by vertue of the said Act, and the Prebyteries that directed them, 
                     〈◊〉
                   the same vpon ignorance, and errour, which is not a lawfull consent. Fourthly, that the present Moderatours, are not of the quality of these constant Moderatours; but of a new Edition set out at Glasgow, viz. the Bishops Deputies in Presbyteries. I answere to the first, that there is no trust to be giuen to you in this businesse, wherin I haue better reason to be beleeued, speaking for worthy and reuerēd men, whose fame was neuer blotted: then such an one as you are, that did not feare to deny the authority of our Souereigne Prince in his owne presence, and immediately after forsweare it to the Brethren. Master Iames Nicolsone now with God, did moderate that Assembly at Linlythguow, a man for his Wisdome, Knowledge, and Holinesse in greater reputation, then that thy calumnies can touch him. All the

conclusions thereof were penned by himselfe, at least by his aduice; and to haue made a greater aduantage, then that conclusion could bring with it, would not haue altered a sillable in any Act, nor forged or foysted in any clause, as thou speakest. The Scribe of that Assembly was Doctour Henry Philip, yet Minister at Arbrothe, whose truth and fidelity, to speake nothing of his Learning Prudence, and other gifts, is as well knowne, as is thy perfidie and presumptuous rebellions, for which now thou liuest in Exile. And if thy sayings, or the speeches of the like of thee, might call such mens honestie in question, it should not goe well. If I seeme more bitter, in this Answere, to the Reader, then I am accustomed, let him consider, that he who neither spares dead, nor liuing, great, nor small, must bee answered sometimes as he deserues. Now where yee say, that the Bishops will not stand to that Assembly now, more then the Church then did, I doe not conceiue, whom ye call the Church: except ye thinke a handfull of mutinous persons, such as your selfe, to be the Church: otherwise the Ministers generally in all the parts of the Countrey did consent and obey the Acts of that Assembly. And what if the conclusions taken therein yet stands, vnrepealed by other Assemblies that haue followed? the Bishops doe all acknowledge and stand to. For it is the Law of the Church, that rules them in matters of outward policie, and all other peaceable Ministers: yee, and the like of you stand to no Law, but the will of your owne minds. Thirdly, where ye say, that some Moderatours were sent Commissioners by the Presbyteries vpon an ignorant conceit, that they were bound by the Act of Linlythguow so to doe, ye qualifie no part of this by any particulars, and if ye did, it would be replyed, that in euery cōuention, that is permitted for exercise through the Land, the fittest and choysest of a number is appointed to moderate: And that whether the moderation lay vpon them, or not▪ their Brethren would haue elected them, and no others to haue bin Commissioners to that Assembly. Lastly, where ye tell vs,

scoffingly, that the present Moderators are of a new edition, to wit, the deputies of Bishops, yee must know, That your changeable Moderators, were of that new edition yee speake of; for in no age was it seene euer before this, that indifferently euery man was taken in his course, to rule and preside without consideration had of his gifts and qualities. And these we haue now, are such as the Christian Church euer had, & vsed to keepe order in their meetings, & conuentions.

               The Assessours to his Maiesties Commissioners, the Nobilitie, Barons, Bishops, Burgesses, and Moderators imposed vpon Presbyteries, with some Ministers voting without warrant, being substracted from the number of the affirmatiue voters, the negatiues will not bee found inferiour in number to the affirmatiues authorised with Commission; And suppose inferiour in number, yet not in weight: for the negatiue voters adhered to the iudgement of the Church, heard no reasons for the nouelties proponed, were not ouercome with perswasions, or terrours, as was the affirmatiues.
            
            
               ANS.
               It hath beene sufficiently proued, that there was neyther Nobleman, Baron, Burgesse, nor Bishop, but had as good warrant to vote, as any of the negatiues, & therefore should not be substracted from the number of the affirmatiue voters. This yee perceiue, and flie to another shift, according to your custome. Yee graunt your number were fewer, for so they were by moe then another halfe: but their weight, yee say, was greater: for with them, as ye alledge, there was three great ouer-weights in the ballance. First, they had no feare. Secondly, they were not ouercome with perswasion: And the third, they adhered to the iudgemēt of the Church. It is true indeed, that neither the feare of inconueniencies, and euills which might haue ensued to the great hurt of the Church, and hinderance of the Gospel, did moue them, nor could reason, whereby the change was manifestly proued both lawfull, and expedient perswade them, but to the

iudgement of the Church (as ye call it) they adhered, with out regard of good or euill, without respect to right or wrong. And this is the Idoll which they still adore. Now let vs consider this iudgement whereunto they adhered. The iudgement of our Church touching ceremonies and circumstances to bee vsed in the worshippe of God, is two-fold. There is one, that is particular: the other is generall. The particular iudgement determineth and defineth what ceremonies in particular the Reformers thought expedient to be receyued, and reiected. The generall declares, what the Church, and euery Christian should esteeme, beleeue, and hold touching the particular order and policie which is set downe for the vse of ceremonies and circumstances to be obserued in the worship of God. The former iudgement is expressed in the first Booke of Discipline, and some few Acts of the generall Assemblies cited afterward by your selfe. This other we haue in the one and twentieth Article of the Confession of Faith, about the end thereof, and in the seuenth Chapter of the second Booke of Discipline; both which are afterwards cited in the examination of your Discourse, where yee professe your selfe to discusse the oath. And it is that iudgement whereunto the Swearers did oblige themselues by their oath. In this it is declared expresly, That no order, nor policie in ceremonies can be established for all times, ages, and places, but that it is temporall, and may and should be changed, when necessitie requires. This is the generall and constant iudgement of the Church, whereunto the negatiue Voters were bound, by their oath to haue adhered, which they did not. That other, whereunto they adhered (as yee alledge) is onely temporall, and subiect to change, according to the opportunities, and occasions of times, places, and persons: For if by occasion of any of these circumstances, the obseruation, which was profitable at one time, become hurtfull at another, and that which serued for reformation, breedes and fosters corruptiō, profanenesse, or superstition; it is the constant

and generall iudgement of the Church, that it should bee changed, and altered, which formerly was obserued. And to apply this to the purpose in hand: It is notoriously knowne, That sitting at the Communion, which at the reformation was iudged most conuenient to abolish the opinion of transubstantiatiō, & bread-worship, makes the Sacrament now to be contemned, and profaned by the common sort of Professours: That the want of diuine exercise on the fiue holy-dayes, hath almost buried in obliuion the inestimable benefits of our redemption; the superstitious obseruation of these times not the lesse continuing still in our Church: That the withholding of Baptisme from infants in times of necessitie, and the holy Supper from others at the houre of their dying, hath beene the griefe of many good Christians. Lastly, that great ignorance is crept into the Church, by the neglect of the catechising of young children, and for lacke of a particular triall of their profiting in knowledge, at the Visitations of Churches. And vpon these, and the like considerations, who sees not, that alteration in these poynts was expedient? Adde to this, our conformitie with the greater part of the reformed Churches, which is to be prefered much, to the singularitie of any priuat opinion, or custome of persons, and Churches. Then the shewing of an vnnecessarie, vndutifull, and vnchristian opposition, and contradiction to the most religious Prince on earth, who for the glorie of God, and the edification of his Church, did vrge this alteration. In this, if his Maiestie had beene gain-stand without right, or reason, what euils and inconueniencies might haue ensued, it is not easie to say. Ye afterwards call it a matter vncertaine, and depending vpon Gods prouidence; but wee are not to prie in these secrets, and ought to follow his reuealed will, who hath commanded vs to feare him, and obey the King. This obedience should euer be performed, where it may stand with the feare of God. These things haue not beene considered by the Negatiue voters: And euidently shew that their pretext of

adhering to the particular iudgement of the Church, whereunto in such cases they ought not to haue adhered, is no other, but a faire excuse, and spacious vaile to couer their wilfull opposition to his Maiesties will, and the well of the Church, which in the estimatiō of euery prudent and peaceable Christian must eleuate the authoritie of all their voyces, and make the same of no weight.

               The affirmatiue voters authorized with Commission, either had their Commissions procured by their Bishoppes, or else were mercenarie Pensioners, or Plat-seruers for augmentation of stipends: or gapers for promotion: or of suspect credit for benefit receiued, or hoped for; or had subscribed other priuate Articles, in priuate more dangerous then the present Articles: or had beene threatned priuatly by their owne Diocesian Bishops with deposition: or were not well informed in their iudgement for lacke of full and free reasoning: or were circumuented with promises made to them, by their Bishops, that they should not be vrged with the practise, if they would onely consent to make an Act to please the King: or were terrified with the publique threatnings before mentioned. Iudge therefore whether these votes should be pondered, or numbered.

                  it man in the art of Calumniation, hee heapes tenne calumnies together in one Section, whereunto in the order they are proponed, I answer; first he sayes, the affirmatiue voters had their Commissions procured by their Bishops. This is so false, as nothing can be more vntruely said: for all the Bishops in their Synods kept before that Assembly, hauing acquainted the Ministers that a supplication would be sent to his Maiestie, for libertie to conuene a generall Assembly, and exponed the necessitie of their admitting the Articles, warned them to chuse the most wise, learned, and peaceable of their number, to bee their Commissioners, if so the libertie craued were obtayned,

but left the persons to be named by themselues, in their meetings at their Exercises: vpon which aduertisement, it is true, That certaine of your factious sort employed all their meanes to procure Commission to themselues, and such others, as they knew would be of their minde; and preuayled so farre, as verie few of the Ministrie possessed with your humor were absent from the Assembly. And to manifest your falshood in this particular: It is notoriously knowne, that at S. Andrewes, one day beeing appoynted for chusing Commissioners of that Exercise, the whole number of Ministers conuened; albeit neither before that time, these tenne or twelue yeares past, nor since, diuers of them were euer seene, eyther at Exercise, or Synods. Notice whereof being giuen to the Archbishop of S. Andrewes, who was at that time in the Citie, by certaine that feared a trouble might fall out amongst them in the nomination, he comes himselfe to their meeting, and declared, how hee, and all that were present, perceiued they were come that day onely, by pluralitie of voyces, to chuse their Commissioners. And howbeit they might iustly be excluded from bearing Commission, or giuing any voice in the choyce of them that should bee sent, who at other times vouchsafed not their presence to the Brethren, lest it should be said afterwards, that the choyce of their Commissioners were not free, he willed them to name whom they thought meetest. And his owne voyce beeing first desired, he named for two, Maister Iohn Carmichaell, and Maister Alexander Henrysone, whom hee knew to bee set both of them against the Articles, that they might haue place to reason, and giue voyce in the Assembly. So farre hee was from plotting and preparing voyces to beare forth that businesse. And as he vttered in the Assembly, at diuers times vpon occasion since, wee haue heard him solemnely protest, that he did neuer open his mouth to solicite or perswade any to stand for receyuing the Articles; but left euery man to his owne iudgement, to doe, and say, as hee should finde the force of reason to moue him. And yet had it beene

so, that the Bishops had named them, and procured their Commission, there should nothing haue beene done, against the custome of the primitiue Church: for no Presbyters were euer admitted to sit in Councels, except they had been authorised by their Bishops, as we shewed before. And during the space of many yeares after our reformation, while the Superintēdents ruled Church affaires, no Minister might come to the generall Assembly, except they had chosen and named him, as was qualified before out of their owne Assemblies. This is our reply to the first.
               The second calumnie is, That the affirmatiue Voters were mercenarie Pensioners: If hee had set downe their names, and shewed, whose Pensioners they were, wee should haue easily shewed, that though they were Pensioners, yet they were not mercenarie men. One may safely enioy a benefice conferred vpon him by his Prince, or some noble Personage in regard of his former seruices, yet be no mercenarie. And they may be mercenaries who enioy no pension at all; for euen the disposition of a man wil make him iustly to be counted such: Neither to my knowledge was there in that Assembly any one that had pension of his Maiestie, Maister Patrick Galloway excepted, whom before yee scoffingly termed a man of many pensions. But ye are not I hope so farre past shame, as to say, that hee enioyes any of his pensions, how few, or many so euer they be, vpon paction, or promise to be yeelding vnto euerie thing, that his Maiestie should be pleased to propone to the Church: yea it is knowne, that in these same matters he alone did more then ye all, to haue diuerted his Maiestie by humble aduise and perswasion from vrging them further: And tooke the boldnesse to propone his reasons in writing, against the Festiuities, and the Article of kneeling: which his Maiestie was graciously pleased to Answer by himselfe for his better satisfaction. These fiue and fortie yeares, or aboue, he hath liued a Minister in the Church of Scotland, and was his Maiesties owne Chaplaine, during the most of that time. And for his labours and continuall

trauels taken for the benefit of the Church, deserued better reward, then all the pensions hee enioyes. But when this age is gone, his iust praise in despight of you all shall continue with the posteritie. If I pleased, I could reply, that the chiefe of your Sect hath a pension of his Maiestie, of greater worth then all his put together, and enioyes it with preiudice of many poore Ministers; and for no merite at all, except it be merite to worke his Maiestie perpetuall vexation, and keepe the Church with his conceits in continuall trouble. And I could tell you in a word, that it is more fitting to be his Maiesties pensioner, then the pensioner of any Burgesses wife, or Ladie in the Countrey, such as many of you are; and were not your purses filled by this meanes, we should not be troubled with your vnrulinesse. These things you must patiently heare, for they are truths, seeing yee forbeare not to lye of men more worthie, beyond all comparison, then is your selfe.
               Your third calumnie is, That they were Platseruers for augmentation of stipends: this is an euident vntruth. The Commission for stipends expired in the Moneth of Iuly before that Assembly, and further hope of augmentation they could not haue: where yee shall suffer this to be told you, that the negatiue voters had greater benefit by that Commission, then the affirmatiue: And that according to your manner, you gaue good attendance all that time, and many hopes of good behauiour, till your businesse was effected: Howbeit since, diuers of you haue turned your Cloakes, as wee vse to say; Albeit the benefit is not lost, for it was not to you done, or for any of you, but to the Churches, at which ye presently serue.
               Ye say fourthly, That they were gapers for promotion: But how doe you know that? Who made you a Iudge of your Brethren? Is this pietie to iudge of mens hearts and affections at your pleasure? None of you (forsooth) like to haue promotions, and I warrant you would flie into deserts to hide your selues, if ye knew your selues to be sought to be

placed in high roomes: but what meanes then your continuall resort in the chiefe Townes, with the neglect and contempt of your owne cures at home? Yee professe not to loue the World, yet none followes it so much. Ye may not endure domination, yet will play the Lords ouer Kings, and the consciences of euery man; and think while as ye declame against ambition, wealth, and worldly honour, that yee are not perceyued euen then, and by that meane, chiefly to hunt after these things.
               Ye say fiftly, That they were of suspect credite; and I beleeue it well, with you, they were so: Nay, yee might say more, ye suspected they were Reprobates; for it is a thing familiar to your Sect, to pronounce of mens saluation, and condemnation, as they fancie. And yet that Booke, which they say some of you haue made vp, to note therein, the names of the holy Societie, is not the Booke of Life. The credite of that Register is not committed vnto you.
               Sixtly, They had subscribed, ye say; other priuate Articles, more dangerous then the present: I conceiue your meaning to be, of the Articles offered vnto them, that enter in the Ministrie: If yee haue not seene them, ye shall know, that these Articles bind such as enter, to the obedience of the present discipline, and of all, and whatsomeuer acts, and constitutions, that shall be lawfully made hereafter by the Church, in matters of outward policie, and order: whereunto I will not say, the falshood, but the inconstancie of some of your number, gaue the occasion, who after they had promised to liue peaceable, and obedient to the Church, within a few dayes, hauing gotten what they sought for, became more turbulent and vnquiet then any.
               Seuenthly, They had beene threatned, you say, priuately, with deposition by their owne Diocesian Bishops. And wil ye qualifie this of any one person, wee shall grant all your informalities. But this is so vntrue, as yee neuer shall bee able to doe it.
               
                  Eightly, They were not well informed in their iudgements, for lacke, yee say, of full and free reasoning. Here ye construe other men by your selfe, and some of your side; who being asked the reason of their negatiue voyce, answered, That they had neuer studied the question well, yet that they followed the example of learned and godly men, with whom they had rather erre ignorantly, then follow the Bishops with some shew of reason. And one of your negatiue Voters professed publiquely in the Assembly, That he saw no euident reason against the lawfulnesse of the Articles, yet he would refuse them, because his deceassed father did mislike them. These were the best informations that the most of your negatiues had; as to the affirmatiue Voters, when yee, or any man shall aske them, they will giue reason sufficient for their iudgement.
               Ninthly, they were circumuented with promises, yee say, made to them by their Bishops, that they should not be vrged with the practice, if they would only consent to make an act, to please the King. But you should haue named the Bishops that made such promises, for your saying deserues not that credit. It is true, that when some of you acknowledging the matters to be lawfull in themselues, complayned only of precipitation, and that time was not giuen them to resolue, it was answered by some in priuate, That if they would ceasse from their businesse, and professe so much in publike, which in conference they acknowledged of the lawfulnesse of the Articles, time should bee granted vnto them, before the practice were vrged. But this they obserued not, and did to the contrary what they could; and this I hope was no circumuention of any man, nor were any of the affirmatiue voters carryed by these promises: for what they voted vnto without any scruple, they haue since that time practised. Your tenth and last calumny, that they were terrified with publike threatnings, hath been answered before. And now when ye desire your Reader to iudge, whether the

voices should be pondered, or numbered; I trust it hath not appeared by any of your alleadged motiues, that there is such cause; on the other side, if your negatiue voters had equalled the affirmatiue in number, they might haue beene iustly reiected; first, for the open preiudice they had committed in preaching, and publike condemning the Articles that they knew were to be reasoned, as impious, Papistical, and Idolatrous. I know yee will oppose to this, the preiudice you mentioned before, committed by the affirmatiue voters in the practice of the Ceremonies before they were established. But what they did in this, was by the aduice of the chiefe Ministers in the Kingdome, without condemning the former practice of the Church, and vnder protestation, that if the Church did not find the Articles fit to bee receiued, their practice should not tye them in after-times, seeing they acknowledged the indifferencie of all these matters. Next, the chiefe reasons which your negatiue voters gaue at any time, were, the hazard of their credits amongst their flockes, and of feare to be reputed inconstant, if they should yeeld at the sudden to that, which they had so openly condemned: and what are their reasons being well sifted, but reasons of selfe-loue, and a care to maintaine your popular estimation, which is nothing so much to bee regarded, as is his Maiesties satisfaction? Therfore to end this purpose, whether ye regard the weight, or the number of voyces, the affirmatiues were superior in both.
            
            
               PP.
               
                  In omnibus causis pro facto accipitur id in quo quis alium terrefacit, quo minus fiat: In this Assembly the affirmatiue voters confessed, that they assented not simpliciter to the Articles proponed as knowne truths, but onely to auert the wrath of authoritie, standing in their owne iudgement against them, and not for them, in respect of the estate of this Church. Hence it may be cleerly seene, that their votes were only affirmatiue, in respect of their feare, but negatiue, in

respect of their iudgement, and dutifull affection to this Church.
            
            
               ANS.
               None of the affirmatiue voters approued the Articles for knowne verities; for when wee speake of knowne verities, we vnderstand the verities defined in Scripture, such as are the points of our faith, which no man ought to call in question: but that any man did giue his voice otherwise, then his iudgement led him, yee will hardly perswade vs, much lesse, that any man would openly professe this: for that had beene little better, then the resolution of Medea in the Tragedie: Video meliora, probo

                     ; deteriora sequor. As to the feare, yee so oft mention, it was a feare not contrarie to the dutifull affection we owe to the Church; nor repugnant to the iudgement which they had, that were moued therewith: but a feare commendable flowing both from their affection, and iudgement, for they feared no particular hurt to their owne persons, or punishment to haue beene inflicted vpon themselues, but to irritate so gracious a King and a Prince so carefull of the good of the Church; and to bring the Church into an vnnecessary trouble by the obstinate refusing of lawfull Articles, this wee hope all good men feared, and still feare. And certainly, whosoeuer lackes this feare are not fit to serue in a Church, and more vnfit to determine of Church-matters.
            
            
               PP.
               Other informalities may be obserued, but these are sufficient to prooue the nullity of this pretended Assembly, whereby the established estate of this Church, is so far preiudged, or rather simple people for their facility indangered, if they vpon the pretended authority of this Assembly, shall aduenture to make defection from their former profession confirmed by so many, and well aduised Assemblies, and blessed by the experience of Gods great loue in his best benefits; or to violate their solemne Oath and Subscription.

The pretender may as safely professe, that hee will alter his profession, or violate his Oath and Subscription, suppose there had beene no Assembly at all. But to detayne simple people in their begunne reuolt, it will be cryed out, and inculcate, that some few persons (and to make them odious, they will be called Mal-contents, Troublers of the Estate, Seditious persons, and what not? for the which contumelies and reproches account must be made one day) that they may not, nor should not iudge vpon the nullity of the Assemblies. It is true by way of Iurisdiction, or Superordination as they call it, no priuate man should presume so to doe, for that iudgement belongs to another free and lawfull Assembly; but by the iudgement of discretion, euery Christian man ought to iudge, how matters of Religion are imposed vpon him, and by what authoritie. If thou mayest not discerne as a Iudge, thou mayest discerne as a Christian. If yee shall admit indifferently whatsoeuer is concluded vnder the glorious name of an Assembly, then may wee be brought to admit not only the English Ceremonies, but also Lutheranisme and Papistrie. If Ministers giue way to their Parochiners to practise the obtruded Ceremonies at their pleasures: If sworne Professors intangle themselues againe, with the superfluities whereof the Lord hath made them free, let the one and the other take heed, how they defend themselues from the iust challenge of back-sliding, and the rest of the inconueniences that may ensue on their change.

               This Libeller being now to conclude the Nullity, which he intended to proue, paines himselfe to mooue the People, Ministers, Professors, and all to disobedience of the Acts concluded: and where the authority of the Assembly, might draw men to condescend, hee labours to shew them, that euen the iudgement of the lawfulnesse of Assemblies in some sort doth belong to euery Christian; which if it should not,

he laies downe certaine inconueniences; that thereby might grow vpon them all▪ to which I answere, that this Assembly being conuocated, in the Name of God, assisted in the proceedings thereof by his blessed Spirit, and all the Informalities obiected being now sufficiently cleered, we are perswaded euery true Christian whether he be Minister, or Professor, will submit his iudgement and affections both, to the conclusions taken therein. And if any will still oppose thēselues thereto, we doubt not to cal them troublers of the Estate, seditious Persons, Schismatickes, louers of Diuision, and direct Enemies to the Weale, and peace both of the Church, and Kingdome. That ye would bee called such men, ye might well prophesie, seeing ye be priuy to your owne intentions; but where ye adiect that account must be made one day of such contumelies and reproches, I would but aske you, whether yee doe thinke to passe free in the Day of that account, and not be brought to your answere, for calling the Seruants of Christ, mercenarie men, and thereby implying his Maiestie, your Souereigne to be another Balak in giuing the wages of iniquitie, to hirelings: for condemning all, that are obedient to the voyce of the Church in these matters, as men periured, and without all conscience, and diuers others your malicious speeches, vttered in this Pamphlet: or if you thinke it no fault to make a rent in the body of Christ, which is his Church? which it appeares euidently ye are only about; The answeres following will cleere to all men, that the estate of our Church is no way preiudged by any Act concluded in the Assembly at Perth, and that the obedience thereof, will not inferre a defection from our former profession. But that distinction of two-fold iudgement serues little to this purpose: for howbeit lawfully euery man may inquire of things concluded, and for his owne information seeke out the grounds and warrants thereof, yet whithersoeuer his iudgement incline hee must render himselfe obedient to the Constitutions of the Church in which he liues.

And there is a great difference betweene decerning and discerning, though eyther yee or your Printer hath mistaken it; for it belongeth to the Iudge to decerne, and Christians, as ye say, euen in their priuate callings may discerne, but this their discerning will neuer free them from the subiection of Lawes imposed, especially in matters of this nature, for wee are now vpon order, and policie onely. And except ye could shew some euident place out of the Word, or bring a necessarie demonstration to warrant your contrarie iudgement, your disobedience will euer be faultie. The authoritie of the Church must yeeld to the written Word, but the iudgements of priuate men, to the authoritie of the Church. Otherwise, we should open a doore to all confusion, neyther could there be order in a Church, if euery man should bee permitted to follow his owne conceit, and doe as his priuie iudgment did leade him. This our Church wisely foreseeing, in an Assembly kept at Edinburghe, anno 1583. 10. Octob. statuted, and ordained, That no Act concluded by a generall Assembly, should bee called in question by any particular brother, nay, not in another generall Assembly, except some iust cause might be seene for the change thereof. And if it be not lawfull to call any of the constitutions of the Church in question, much lesse to impugne by writ, and print, the same so maliciously, as you haue done. I omit the vnseemely match which yee make of English ceremonies, and Lutheranisme, with Papistrie: for this is your malice against the English Church, which it becomes you to reuerence, and of whom, if ye did loue the truth of God, ye would haue spoken more honorably.

               If the Parliament by acts, authorize matters effected with such informalities, and nullities, matters of themselues so contrarious to our profession, their ratification of a vicious thing, cannot be a rule to a christian mans conscience. But it is to be hoped, that the Lord shall so dispose the hearts of

Statesmen to the loue of the truth, quietnesse of the Church, and Country, and peace of mens consciences, that no vnreasonable burthen shall be knit vpon the members of Christs Body, by any deed of theirs, vnder the name of a benefit to the Church. Inuito beneficium non datur.

               Since the time that Kings and Princes became Christian, it hath alwayes beene the custome that Synodicall Decrees were authorized by their Lawes; not that the allowance or authoritie of Ciuill Lawes is made a rule to a Christians Conscience, but that the externall man might thereby bee tyed to the obedience of these things, which the Church hath found to be agreeable to the Word of God, that is the only rule of conscience: and it is to bee hoped, that God shall so dispose the hearts of the whole Estate, to the loue of his Truth, and the Peace, and quietnesse of his Church, that refractarie and turbulent persons, such as ye are, shall bee restrayned of your vnbridled licentiousnesse, and kept vnder the obedience of the Church, and the Orders by her lawfully established; which howsoeuer ye that loue to liue after your owne mindes, call an vnreasonable burthen, all true and peaceable Christians will esteeme a benefite to the Church, and bee thankfull vnto God for the same.

               We haue considered all these three as ye desire, and finde the reasons proponed by you for the Nullitie of this Assembly to be Nullities in themselues. Next, that the Oath and

Subscription by you mentioned, admits the change concluded, and does not abhorre it, the same change being a part of the Oath which we all gaue, as in discussing of the Oath shall be cleered. Thirdly, that the particulars concluded, are things lawfull, of their owne nature indifferent, and most conuenient for this time: in regard the generall Church, who hath the place and power of determining the expediencie of Rites and Ceremonies, hath interposed their authority to the same, which in the estimation of Wisemen is sufficient to make them bee compted such.

                  THe Articles proponed, if they be concluded, they doe innouate, and bring vnder the slander of change, the estate of this Church, so aduisedly established by Ecclesiasticall Constitutions, Acts of Parliament, approbation of other Churches, and good liking of the best reformed Christians without and within this Kingdome, and so euidently blessed with happy successe, and sensible experience of Gods greatest benefits, by the space of fiftie eight yeares and aboue; so that wee may boldly say to the praise of God, That no Church hath enioyed the truth and puritie of Religion in larger libertie. And vpon some such considerations, it pleased his gracious Maiestie to continue the Church of England in her established estate, as may bee seene in the Conference at Hampton Court, and Thomas Sparke his booke written thereupon, Ipsa quippe mutatio, etiam quae adiuuat vtilitate, nouitate perturbat: quapropter quae vtilis non est, perturbatione infructuosa consequenter noxia est, saith Augustine, Epist. 118. that is, Euen a change that is helpefull for vtilitie, perturbeth with the noueltie.

This Law of Faith standing firme, the remanent things, that concerne discipline and conuersation, admit the noueltie of correction by the grace of God, which worketh and maketh a profitable progresse, euen to the end. Augustines sentence, which yee cite, is not repugnant to this, for in that place he speaketh not of such a mutation, as proceedeth from the instant, and lawfull desire of a Prince, and after due deliberation, is concluded by the body of the whole Church; but of such a nouation as is vrged contentiously by some curious spirits, who being strangers to the Church, wherein they presse to make the nouation, would haue the customes thereof changed, according to the formes of their owne Countrey; or being trauelled abroad, would make a reformation according to that, which they see in their peregrination, Aut quia in sua patria sic ipse consueuit, aut quia ibi vidit vbi peregrinationem suam, quo remotiorem à suis, eo doctiorem factam putat. In such a case, saith Augustine, the nouation helpeth not so much by vtilitie, as it hurteth by noueltie; such was the alteration that was intended and vrged by some Innouators at Hampton Court. Where notwithstanding some few particulars were explayned in the Liturgie of the Church of England, as is set downe in the third dayes Conference by D. William Barlow, as followeth.

                  They are declared by this Church to bee contrary doctrine, as may bee seene in the first, second, and third Chapters of the first booke of Discipline, in these words: Wee iudge that all doctrine repugnant to the Euangell, should bee vtterly suppressed as damnable to mans saluation, &c. By contrary doctrine, wee vnderstand whatsoeuer men by Lawes, Councells, or Constitutions, haue imposed vpon the consciences of men without the expresse Commandement of Gods Word, as keeping of holy dayes commanded by men, the feast of Christmasse, and other feasts, &c.

                  The iudgement and declaration of our Church touching this point, is very sound; For whatsoeuer is imposed by men, or by Ecclesiasticall Constitution vpon the conscience to bee obserued, as parts of diuine worship, that is not expresly or by necessary consequence contayned in the Word, is contrary to the wholsome Doctrine; as the Papists did the obseruation of Christmasse, and other festiuall dayes; which the reformed Churches, and the Assembly

And therefore, what they concluded according to their Commission, was not obtruded vpon the Churches against their will, but according to their wills contayned in the Commission.

                  The Commissioners of Presbyteries here assembled, vnderstanding the alienation of them from whom they receiued commission, from these Articles, can by no warrant oblige their vnwilling Presbyteries, and Congregations to their votes. Ecclesiam dissentientem & inuitam obligare, quis potest? Who can binde a Church dis-assenting, and vnwilling?
               
               
                  ANS.
                  If the Commissioners had come to the Assembly without a free and vnbounded Commission, to reason, vote, and conclude, in their names, they could not by their votes, and conclusions haue bound the Churches, and Presbyteries from whom they come, if they had after dis-assented. But the generall and vnlimited Commission giuen to the Commissioners, to reason, vote, and conclude with this expresse clause, Firme and stable holding, and for to hold whatsoeuer their Coommissioners should conclude in their names, obliged the Presbyteries and Congregations by whom the Commission was giuen. And here I marke a contradiction betwixt this Article, and that which ye affirme in

discussing of the Oath, pa. 30. Namely, that the Oath of the Church representatiue giuen An. 1596. did oblige them all who were liuing to the maintenance of the puritie of Religion in Doctrine and Discipline.

And as for your 59. yeares practise, it cannot change the nature of things indifferent, and make these formes and circumstances, which are of themselues alterable, become necessary and vnchangeable: yea, by the contrary, the prescription of a long time giues iust cause often of alteration, because either the things practised, which at the beginning were profitable, become hurtfull, or that which was conuenient in the time preceding, becommeth inconuenient: or because the same things are abused to superstition and prophanenesse: or because an opinion is bred, by long custome, of necessitie. This I make manifest by the one and twentieth article of the Confession of our faith, confirmed in the first Parliament holden by his Maiesty, anno 1567. Decemb. 15. which ye affi

                           •
                        cently▪ and in order: not that wee thinke that any policie and order in ceremonies, can be appointed for all ages, times, and places; for as Ceremonies (such as men haue

deuised) are but temporall, so may and ought they to bee changed, when they rather foster superstition, then that they edifie the Church vsing the same. Likewise in the seuenth chapter of the second booke of Discipline, registred amongst the acts of the generall Assembly, anno 1581. we haue two conclusions to the same purpose, set downe in these words: The finall end of all Assemblies, is first to keepe the Religion and Doctrine in puritie, without error and corruption: Next, to keepe comlinesse, and good order in the Church. For this orders cause, they may make certaine rules and constitutions, pertaining to the good behauiour of all the members of the Church in their vocation. Secondly, they haue power also to abrogate and abolish all statutes and ordinances, concerning Ecclesiasticall matters that are found noysome, or vnprofitable, or agree not with the time, or are abused by the people. Hereby it is euident; that seeing the matters controuerted, are but matters of circumstance, forme, and ceremony, as afterwards shall be proued, that neither the Church in generall, nor any member thereof in particular, did, or might lawfully binde themselues by oath, subscription, or any other obligation, not to change or alter their practise and customes touching these things: for all they that subscribe the Confession of faith, and the second booke of Discipline, did sweare, that they thought these things should and might be altered when necessitie required. This answere being made to the first foure Obligations, we come to the Oath, about which yee spend many words, and before yee begin, moue the question following.
               
               
                  PP.
                  
                     Quaeritur, if one or moe Preachers, or Professours in the Church of Scotland, standing to the Churches former iudgement, and able to defend the same by good reason, at least, seeing no warrant in the contrary, may dispense with the said Oath, and follow the pluralitie of Preachers and Professors, dispensing with the same in the Assembly? Or what power may compell the alteration of iudgement,

and loose the said Oath, in any case aforesaid?
               
               
                  ANS.
                  The former iudgement of our Church, whereunto wee did binde our selues by our oathes was, that no policie, nor order in ceremonies could be appointed for all ages, times, and places; and that the same might, and ought to bee changed vpon great causes, and weightie reasons, as is euident by the former answere. To this iudgement of the Church, the Assembly at Perth adhered, and according thereto altered some customes, touching circumstantiall ceremonies formerly vsed in the Church, vpon good and great reasons: neither did that Assembly loose the said Oath, or dispense with it in any sort, but hath confirmed it by their owne practise. Wherefore I answere, That euery Preacher and Professor in our Church, should stand to the former iudgement thereof, whereunto he bound himselfe by his Oath, when he did sweare to the Confession of faith, and that no power can compel the alteration of iudgement, or loose the said Oath in any case. And that he who sware, That he did thinke that no policie, and order in ceremonies can be appointed for all ages, times, and places, but that the same may, and ought to be changed, when necessitie requires; Did neuer, nor could sweare without breach of this Oath, that the ceremonie of sitting at the receiuing of the Sacrament (esteemed by our Church, at the reformation, most conuenient, but not necessarie) could bee appointed for all ages, times, and places; and that it might not, nor ought to bee altered in any case: by the contrary all who swore to the Confession of faith, did sweare, That the policie, and order of sitting at the Sacrament was such, as could not be appointed for all ages, times, and places, and that it might, and should be changed, when it did not so much edifie the people in pietie, as foster prophanenesse and superstition. And this, sitting fosters in all these that practise it, with a superstitious conceit and opinion, that the same was instituted

by our Sauiour as a point of diuine worship, and by his exemplary practise commended to the Church, for an essential or integrant part of the Sacrament, which yee maintaine in this Pamphlet.
                  Now leauing this to bee considered by such as are not partially affected, but loue the truth, and hate contention: I proceed to the Oath, which yee consider first in the persons, takers of the same: Secondly, in the matter whereto they sweare: Thirdly, in the forme and manner, whereby they are bound: And fourthly, by the force and effect of that forme, for making sure mens particular deeds. Touching the persons, yee say this.
               
               
                  PP.
                  The Persons, takers of the Oath, are Christians come to perfect yeares, and free persons, who did not only know in generall the doctrine and discipline, whereto they bound themselues by their oath, but in particular the points controuerted, as followeth: First, That in the yeare of God, 1581. it was concluded, that the Sacraments should be solemnely ministred, and not in priuate houses: Secondly, That in the yeare 1560, it was declared by the Church, that Christ sate with his Disciples at Table, when hee instituted the Supper, and that sitting at Table was the most conuenient gesture to this holy action: Thirdly, That Confirmation was to be abhorred, as one of the Popes fiue bastard Sacraments: Fourthly, That the keeping of Holy dayes, such as the Feast of Christmas, imposed vpon the consciences of men, without warrant of Gods word, was condemned by preaching, and corrected by publique censures of the Church.
               
               
                  ANS.
                  I will not answere you, as iustly I might, that the first booke of Discipline, whereby the most of these constitutions are warranted, was neuer knowne to our common Professors, nor acknowledged by our Church, to haue the authoritie of Ecclesiasticall Canons: but I say, The Assembly

at Perth hath decreed nothing to the contrary thereof. For first, Touching the administration of the Sacraments, we fully agree to the ordinance made anno 1581, to wit, That the Sacraments should bee solemnely ministred, and not in priuate houses: The occasion of making this ordinance was a misorder that fell out in the persons of two Ministers, namely, Master Alexander Mure, Minister at Falkland, and Master Alexander Forrester, Minister at Trenent, as is cleare by the narratiue of the act, which is relatiue only to the celebration of Mariage, and the ministration of the Sacraments, extra casum necessitatis, where, without any vrgent necessitie order may be kept. But our question is, whether in extraordinary cases the Sacraments may be ministred extraordinarily in priuate houses, as they were in the Primitiue Church by the Apostles, and in the beginning of the reformation, by the Preachers of the Gospell? In these and the like cases, there is no act of any Assembly, that determines what should bee done. Therefore put the case, our Church had sworne and subscribed that ordinance, yet hath shee done nothing contrary to her oath, either by making, or obeying the acts concluded at Perth, which doe only respect the cases of necessitie.
                  So, whether to sit at a Table in receiuing the Communion, was most conuenient, according as our Church esteemed at the time of reformation, is not the question: but whether to sit at a Table be necessary, as instituted and left by our Sauiours example to be obserued, and that without breach of the institution, the same may not be altered? This question was neuer defined by any Canon of our Church: Therefore put the case, that our Church had sworne and subscribed, That to sit at the Communion was most conuenient, according to the iudgement of our first Reformers: yet, we haue done nothing contrarie to that oath, by interchanging sitting with kneeling, because kneeling at this time is found to be the more conuenient gesture: for that which at one time is more conuenient, may bee lesse conuenient

at another. As to our Sauiours sitting (if so be he sate, 
                        
                           •
                        am adhuc sub iudice lis est) it was not exemplary, or appointed to be followed of vs, as shall be afterwards proued; and his practise did only declare, that sitting might be lawfully vsed, not, that of necessitie it must be vsed, and cannot bee altered, when the Church findes the change expedient.
                  Thirdly, whether Confirmation, as it was abused in Popery for a Sacrament, should be re-induced, is not the question, for that is condemned in the very narratiue of the act made at Perth. But, whether the Bishop in his Visitation, ought to trie the education of yong children in the grounds of Religion, as in the first booke of Discipline the Superintendent was ordained to doe, whereof yee may reade in the fift head touching the office of Superintendents. Therefore put the case our Church had sworne, and subscribed all the heads and Constitutions of the foresaid booke, yet by the act made at Perth, shee hath not violated her oath, by appointing Bishops in their Visitations to take this triall. For they are now the Superintendents of the Church.
                  Fourthly, Wee contend not, whether the obseruation of Holy dayes, as that of Christmas, should be imposed vpon the conscience, which in the explication of the first head of the foresaid booke of Discipline is condemned, as also in the first words of the act made at Perth, touching the fiue dayes: but the question is, whether the Church may appoint the commemoration of Christs inestimable benefits vpon the said dayes, as all the reformed Churches doe, and our Diuines hold to bee lawfull. Of this our Church neuer defined any thing. Therfore the making & obseruing of the act touching this point, is not against her former oath. And to conclude, The Subscribers and Swearers vnto our Doctrine and Discipline, know no Canon nor constitution of the Church made in former times, that is contrary to the Articles concluded at Perth. Thus much 
                        •
                     ouching the persons who did sweare: The next thing yee consider, is the

matter whereunto they did binde themselues by their oath, which yee set downe as followeth.
               
               
                  PP.
                  The matter whereunto they binde themselues by oath, is the Religion, Doctrine, and Discipline receiued, beleeued, and defended by the Church of Scotland; in respect of this matter, the Oath is partly assertorie, and partly promissorie, as yee say.
               
               
                  ANS.
                  By that which alreadie hath been said, it is manifest, that albeit our Church had sworne to all the heads and ordinances aboue specified, set downe in the bookes of Discipline: yet there is nothing committed contrarie to this Oath, by the actes made at Perth. But now since yee are come to the matter of the Oath, let vs see if the points in controuersie be any part of that matter. The matter, as yee affirme, is the Religion, Doctrine, and Discipline, receiued, beleeued, and defended by the Church of Scotland. This definition or description of the matter, is not so full and particular, as is set downe in the Oath it selfe: neither haue yee, in reciting the words, been so faithfull, as yee are feruent for the cause yee maintaine. For yee haue pretermitted diuers things belonging to the limitation of the matter, by which all the particulars in question are clearely excluded. The words cited by you are these: We beleeue with our hearts, confesse with our mouthes, subscribe with our hands, and constantly affirme before God and the world, That the Faith and Religion, receiued, beleeued, and defended by the Church of Scotland, the Kings Maiestie, and three Estates of this Realme, &c. is onely the true Christian Faith and Religion pleasing God, and bringing saluation to man. Heere yee omit many things that concerneth the limitation of the matter, which at that time were knowne to such as sware the same, and now must be expounded vnto the Reader, that is to iudge and consider our Controuersie. Therefore I shall set downe heere the words of the Oathe, as it was published in print by Robert Waldgraue,

anno 1590. We beleeue with our hearts, &c. That this onely i
                           •
                         the true Christian Faith and Religion pleasing God, and bringing saluation to man, which is now by the mercy of God reuealed to the world, by the preaching of the blessed Euangell, and receiued, beleeued, & defended by many & sundry notable Churches & Realmes, and chiefely by the Church of Scotland, &c. In these words we haue two limitations pretermitted by you: The first is, that the matter of the Oath, is the Doctrine and Discipline reuealed to the world by the Gospell: This limitation excludeth all Ecclesiasticall determinations and constitutions, which are not expresly, or by a necessary consequence contained in the written Word. The next is, That the matter of the Oath is the Doctrine and Discipline, which is receiued, beleeued, and defended by many notable Churches and Realmes, and chiefely by the Church of Scotland. This limitation excludeth all these things, wherein the Church of Scotland hath not the consent of many notable Churches and Realmes, who with her hath receiued, beleeued, and defended the same. By these two, are all the points in controuersie excluded, and cut off from being any part of the matter, whereunto the Swearers by their oath did oblige themselues. And vnto these two, if we adde the third limitation, there can remaine no more any doubt, touching the matter of the Oath. This is, that the Doctrine and Discipline, whereunto they sweare, is particularly expressed in the Confession of Faith, established, and publikely confirmed by sundry actes of Parliament. This Confession is registred in the bookes of Parliament, at the yeare 1567. and is inserted amongst the Confessions of the Reformed Churches in the booke called Syntagma Confessionum. But so it is, that in the Confession of our Faith established by Parliament, there is no mention made of the Articles controuerted: neither hath many notable Churches and Realmes receiued, beleeued, or defended the same, neither are they expresly, or by necessary consequence contained in the Gospell: And therefore they cannot by any point of our Religion,

or part of the Doctrine and Discipline, whereunto the Swearers did oblige themselues by their assertory, and promissory Oath. By the Gospell it is not certaine, That our Sauiour and the Apostles did sit at the Supper, and albeit he had sitten, yet sitting is no more commanded to be obserued in that sacred action, then the vpper chamber where he sate, or the night season, when the Supper was celebrated, or the sex, and number of the Communicants, who were twelue men, and no women; or the qualitie of the element, which was vnleauened bread, or the order finally after Supper. All these, howbeit they be certaine, yet none of them are esteemed exemplary; far lesse can sitting, which is vncertaine, be esteemed such. And for the rest of the points, Neither kneeling at the Communion, nor the administration of the Sacraments in priuate houses, when necessitie requires, nor the commemoration of Christs inestimable benefits, on certaine set times of the yeare, nor the triall of yong childrens education by the Bishop at his Visitation: none of these, I say, are either expresly or by necessary consequence forbidden in the Gospell, nor are hey condemned by many notable Churches and Realmes, nor abiured in the Confession of our Faith, confirmed by actes of Parliament; and so cannot be counted the matter of this Oath.
                  But to remooue all scruple that may arise, touching the matter of this Oath: It is true, That in the promissorie Oath, the Swearers thereof binde themselues to continue in the Doctrine and Discipline of the Church of Scotland, and to defend the same according to their vocation and power all the dayes of their liues, vnder the paines contained in the Law, and danger both of body and soule in the day of the Lords fearefull iudgement. Heere, touching the Doctrine, praised be God, there is no controuersie amongst vs: all the doubt concerneth Discipline, and that is remoued also, if it be taken only for that which is reuealed in the Gospell, or receiued, beleeued and defended by many

notable Churches and Realmes, or that which is set downe in the Confession of Faith, as is already declared▪ But because the Discipline of the Church may be extended beyond these limits, and made to comprehend all Ecclesiasticall constitutions and determinations of generall circumstances, formes and ceremonies belonging to the worship of God, and the decent ordering of his house; let vs consider this point more particularly.
                  If by the Discipline of the Church in the words of the Oath,A consideration of the Discipline whereunto the Swearers did oblige themselues: that part of Ecclesiasticall policie bee meant, which concernes the censuring of manners: in which sense it is taken, in the order set downe before our Psalme bookes, and in the seuenth h
                        •
                     ad of the first booke of Discipline, intituled (of Ecclesiasticall Discipline) and in the second booke, wheresoeuer it is mentioned, and by all Ecclesiasticall writers most frequently: Then it is certaine, that the fiue Articles controuerted, belong nothing to the Discipline, wherein the Swearers binde themselues by their oath, to continue to their liues end.
                  But if therby be meant the whole policie of the Church, in which sense it is sometimes taken, though rarely: then first, it containes all the precepts of policie prescribed in the Word, in which precepts there is no determination concerning these articles, as before we said. Next, it comprehendeth all the ordinances of the Church, touching formes, ceremonies, and order to be obserued in Diuine Seruice, and in the exercise of Ecclesiasticall Censures, according as the circumstances of time, place, and persons. In this part of Discipline, it is true, that all the controuerted points are contained: But as I shewed before, it is manifest by the limitations of the matter of the Oath, that this part of the policie is excluded; for it is neither expressely, nor by necessary consequence contained in the Word, nor is it receiued, beleeued, and defended by many notable Churches and Realmes; nor is there any thing concerning it set downe in the Confession of Faith, confirmed by actes

of Parliament; onely this generall wee haue, that no constant order and policie can be set downe in ceremonies, and that constitutions made by men, may and ought to be altered when need requires.
                  Furthermore, in the booke of Policie that was published after the Oath, anno 1581, and subscribed by sundrie Ministers, there is no mention made of these fiue Articles now in question. In the first booke of Discipline penned anno 1560, there are some conclusions set downe touching sitting at the Sacrament, the abolition of Holy dayes dedicated to Saints in Popery, and the Feast of Christmas, imposed vpon the consciences of men; as also the administration of Baptisme vpon ordinary dayes of preaching, for remouing the Papisticall opinion of absolute necessitie; and if by the discipline mentioned in the Oath, yee vnderstand the conclusions of Policie set downe in that booke, and hold that the Swearers did by their Oath oblige themselues to obey all the conclusions thereof to their liues end: then I demand what is the cause, that yee and your followers do not only refuse to obey, but improue and impugne the most principall point of policie set downe in that booke, namely the office of Bishops, whose prouision, jurisdiction, power and election, are particularly described in the first head of that booke, vnder the name of Superintendents? But because the booke is rare, and not at euery mans hand, I will draw out of it onely some few things, touching the jurisdiction and power of the Superintendents, that the posterity may see what was the judgement of their Predecessors, the Reformers of Religion, touching the Office-bearers, and gouernment of the Church. And to beginne with the bounds of their jurisdiction, the same is set down with this Title:
               
            
            
               
               The names of the places of residence, and seueral Diocesses of the Superintendents.

               The Superintendent of Argyle, his Diocesse shall be Argyle, Kintyre, Lorne, the South Iles, Arrane and Boote, with their adjacents, and Lowhaber: His Residence in Argyle.
               
               The Superintendent of Abirdene, his Diocesse betweene Die and Spae, containing the Shirrefdomes of Abirdene and Banff
                  ▪ His Residence in old Abirdene.
               
               The Superintendent of Brechin, his Diocesse, the whole Shirrefdomes of Mernis and Angouse, with the Brae of Marre to Die: His Residence in Brechin.
               
               The Superintendent of Fife; his Diocesse, the Shirrefdomes of Fife and Fotthringham to Striuiling, and the whole Shirrefdome of Perth: his Residence in Saint Andrewes.
               
               The Superintendent of Edinburgh his Diocesse, the Shirrefdome of Lowthian and Striuiling
                  ▪ on the South-side of Forth, wherto is added by the consent of the whole Church, Merse, Lawderdale and Weddale: his Residence in—

               The Superintendent of Dumfreis, his Diocesse, Galloway, Carrick, Niddisdale, Annandale, with the rest of the Westdales: his Residence in Dumfreis.
               
               
                  These were the bounds of their Iurisdiction: their Office is described as followeth.
            
            
               The function and power of the Superintendents.
               THey must not be suffered to liue, as idle Bishops hitherto haue done; neither must they remaine where gladly they would, but they must be Preachers themselues.
               Charge and command shall be giuen them, to plant and erect Churches, to sett, order and appoint Ministers, as is prescribed, in their Countries.
               After they haue remained in their chiefe Towne three or foure monethes at the most, they shall enter in Visitation, in the which they shall not onely Preach, but examine the life, diligence and behauiour of the Ministers; as also they shall trie the estate of their Churches, and the manners of the People.
               They must further consider, how the poore are prouided, and the youth instructed: they must admonish, where admonition needs, and redresse such things, as by good counsell they are able to appease,
               Finally, they must note such crimes as be hainous, that by the censures of the Church the same may bee corrected. After all this, the order of election of Superintendents is set downe, which we haue more largely before the booke of our Psalmes in meeter.
               This being one of the chiefe points of policie concluded in that booke: how is it, that yee haue dispensed with your oath hereabout? And by what power is your oath loosed concerning this head? Shall men bee tyed by the Oath to the ceremonies prescribed in that booke, and not to the substance of the policie? to alterable circumstances and formes of actions, and not to the power of gouernement, whereby they should be disposed and ordered? What can be answered to this, by him that vrges the Oath for the controuerted points, consisting in ceremonies, gestures and

circumstances, for the indifferent Reader iudge.
               But because it is true, that one mans fault excuses not another▪ leauing you to your consciences, we answere for our selues, according to the one and twentieth article of the 
                     •
                  onfession of our Faith: That we thinke no policie, nor order in ceremonies can be established to endure for all ages, times and places; and that whatsoeuer things are appointed by men▪ they are all temporall, and may, and ought to be changed, when necessitie requireth. Hereupon we say, That no man

Yea, we further affirme, that euery man who sware to the discipline of the Church in generall, by vertue of that oath standeth obliged▪ not only to obey and

to the generall rules which God hath giuen, that according to them may be defined, whatsoeuer the necessitie of the Church requires to be appointed for order and decencie. Finally, seeing God hath set downe nothing of those matters expressely, because they are not necessary to saluation, and are diuersely to bee applyed, to the manners of euery age, and for edification of the Church; it is lawfull, as the vtilitie of the Church shall require, as wel to change and abrogate these that haue been in vse, as to appoint new ceremonies. I confesse indeed, that we should not runne rashly and vpon light motions, vnto nouation: but what may hurt, and what may edifie, Charity can best iudge, which, if wee admit to bee moderatrix, all shall be in safetie, and goe well. Thus farre Caluine, whereby he doth manifest, that the Church hath power to change and innouate, as necessity requireth, all the particular ordinances shee maketh of things alterable: and they who in generall haue sworne to obey the Discipline of the Church, are all bound by their oath to kneele at the Communion, to obserue the fiue Holy dayes, and to obey all the rest of the Articles concluded at Perth.
               
               That which yee afterwards subjoyne, touching the forme and force of the Oath we approue: onely we wish you to consider, seeing it is a part of Ecclesiasticall Discipline, as well to change and abrogate ceremoeies in vse, as to appoint new: That yee by all these forcible formes of the Oath, which cannot be loosed, are obliged to follow the Church in the alterations shee makes, and to defend and obey the Actes and Constitutions that concerne the same; and that all, who disobey in their owne persons, or by their exemplary practise and perswasions, induce others to disobey and rebell, to the disgrace of their Mother the Church, and the breaking of the bond of peace, whereby the vnitie of the Spirit is conserued, doe assuredly lye tyed vnder the fearefull cords and chaines of periury, except they seriously repent.

                     •
                  aith aboue rehearsed, they stood obliged to obey euery alteration, that should be concluded by the Church. The

Church representatiue did sweare in that Article, to alter all such constitutions, when it should be needfull: and the particular members of the Church sweare to obey her will and ordinance in the points altered and changed. For to obey the Discipline in generall, is to obey euery thing, that the Church by the power giuen her of God appointeth to bee done, or not done, for order and policie. So, for any nouation that is made, neither hath the King, nor the Church representatiue violated their Oath, nor haue the inferiour members beene loosed and freed from their oathes, but in giuing obedience to the points of Discipline concluded by their Superiours, they made their oathes and promises good, which otherwise by their disobedience they should haue transgressed.
               As to the Oath which (as you say) the Bishop of Ely, now Bishop of Winchester, affirmeth his Maiestie twice to haue giuen, for maintaining that forme and manner of Gods worship established by the Lawes of both Kingdomes, you might easily haue perceiued, that he did not by the forme which he mentioneth, vnderstand these indifferent points of policie, wherein some little disconformity there is, and cannot but be, in regard of the different estate of our Church and theirs; but by that forme, her vnderstood that same fashion and manner of worshipping God, as is prescribed to vs in his Word, is proponed in the seuerall Confessions of our Faith, which is one, and the same both with them and vs. So you depraue that reuerend Fathers speech, and craftily insinuate his Maiestie to be guiltie of periury, in that by his Highnesse most lawfull and earnest desire, the alteration of these indifferent things hath beene wrought: but yee should know, that these are but things accessory to the essentiall forme of Gods worship, whereunto his Maiesty did sweare at his Coronation, which to this day constantly he hath maintained, and will by the grace of God for many yeares after, yea, euen vntill that temporall

               Another defence ye alledge is vsed by the Pastors, and 
                     •
                  rofessors that liue obedient to the Laws of the Church: They haue not violated their Oath, they say, because the

                  ubstance of Religion is kept, and onely some indifferent 
                     •
                  oints altered. And to this yee make three replyes: First,

                  aying, That we sware to keepe the same forme of wor

                  hip, that was vsed in the Church of Scotland, and specially in the vse of the Sacraments. Secondly▪ That the Oath was in a matter of Religion, which is not changeable▪ as are the Statutes of Republiques and Corporations. Thirdly, Put the case, yee say, the points innouated were matters indifferent; yet seeing they were once abiured for their abuse, they may not be receiued againe, except either we could prooue, that our oath in the beginning was vnlawfull, or that our former formes are become vnlawfull, not expedient for edification of the Church, o
                     •
                   
                  
                     •
                  esse edificatiue, then the ceremonies presently vrged.
               
                  
                     •
                   answere to the first▪ That the forme of worship vsed in the Church of Scotland is not altered; for still we hold that forme of worship, which is prescribed to vs in the Word, defended & receiued by many notable Churches and Realmes, and particularly contained in the Confession of our Faith. As for the gesture and kneeling, and those other circumstances of times and places, where the Sacraments may be ministred in cases of extremity, there is no man, being in his right wits, that will thinke the forme of Gods worship consisteth in such things, or that they are any part thereof. Your second reply we admit, and affirme according thereto, That the matter of Religion, whereto we sware, is not alterable, nor can it bee changed▪ And that the points questioned, being of their owne nature indifferent, are excluded from the Oath, and are no part of the matter thereof.
               To your third reply, I answere, That wee haue not receiued any thing againe in our Church, which euer was

damned, and abiured for their abuse: for in the negatiue part of our oath, wherein Papistrie is abiured, there is no mention of kneeling, nor of the commemoration of Christs benefits vpon the fiue anniuersary dayes, nor is any of the other three Articles euer touched. It is true, that Popish dedication of dayes to other Creatures, and the obseruation of them, with an opinion of necessitie, or that they were any part of Gods worship, are abiured in that Confession, (and that also wee haue condemned in the Acte made at Perth, concerning the obseruation of these times:) but to make commemoration of the benefits, that our Sauiour by his Birth, Passion, Resurrection, and Ascension hath brought vnto vs, we neuer held it vnlawfull, nor did count it a matter of abuse. Therefore it is not necessary, that either our oath be proued vnlawful, or our former formes; it sufficeth, that they bee prooued lesse edificatiue, or not so expedient for the time, because they are abused by the people to superstition and prophanenesse, as afterwards we will make cleare in their owne place.
               Where yee say, That it was confessed in the Assembly, that they were not expedient for our Church, and that the same were yeelded vnto, for holding of some externall inconueniences, a matter now denied, yee say, as importing tyrannie, because you confesse, you haue this only by report; and it is the nature of all your sort to be too credulous, we passe it. In the meane time wee will not deny, that to some, they appeared very inexpedient, for diuers respects, of the which the chiefe were, the discredit they feared to incurre with their people, that did esteeme the condemning of the abuse of these ceremonies, to haue been an absolute reiecting of them, as ceremonies idolatrous, which neuer was done by any prudent or wise Pastor: another respect was, because simple ones, that had not learned to make distinction betweene circumstances, and the substance of Religion, might take

                  
                     〈1 page〉
                  
                  
thus abused by people vnto superstition, this is one pregnant reason wherefore the alteration should haue beene made.
               As to that which they speake of the credite of Pastors, the same ought not to be maintained, by 
                     •
                  ostering an errour in the hearts of people; namely, that the Ministers taught that which they neuer taught, or at least should not haue taught: As by example, that the obseruation of the fiue Holy dayes, to the commemoration of Christs benefits, is vnlawfull. This I am assured was neneuer done by any well aduised Preacher, for it had bin a condemning of the Primitiue Church, and all the Reformed Churches now in the world, Likewise, to haue taught that kneeling in the acte of receiuing the Sacrament is vnlawfull, were to haue contradicted the best, and most learned Diuines we haue. Beza saith of it, Speciem habet piae, ac Christianae venerationis, ac proinde olim potuit cum fructu vsurpari. That is to say, kneeling at the Sacrament hath a shew of holy and Christian worshippe, and therefore of old might haue been fruitfully vsed. Whereby yee see, he condemneth not simply the ceremonie, but witnesseth that there was a time, when the same did edifie and profite. Caluine, before him, called it Cultum legitimum, that is, a Lawfull adoration, being vsed in the action of the Supper, and directed to Christ. Petrus Martyr saith, Multi piè genua flectunt & adorant, that is, Many in receiuing the Sacrament doe bow their knees religiously, and adore Christs flesh. Paraeus speaking of the same gesture, esteemes it an indifferent ceremonie. And that which so great and learned Diuines iudged to bee lawfull, what are we to condemne?
               Next, I answere, That the credite of the Pastours should not be maintained with the discredit of the Prince amongst his Subiects: for if they who should be patternes of reuerence and obedience to others, shall in their owne persons withstand the lawfull desires, & godly intention

                  PP.
                  IT hath been the vniforme, and constant order of this Church since the Reformation, that the Communicants should receiue the Sacramentall elements of Bread and Wine, sitting at the Table. In the second head of the first booke of Discipline, are set downe these words: The Table of the Lord is then rightly ministred▪ when it approacheth most neere to Christs owne action: But plaine it is, that at that Supper Christ Iesus sate with his Disciples, and therefore we doe iudge, that sitting at that Table is most conuenient to that holy a

of time, and confirmed by oathes and subscriptions, as is euident by the former deduction. It is notwithstanding expedient to descend further in opening vp the vnlawfulnesse of kneeling. First, as it is a breach of the Institution. Secondly, as it is a breach of the second Commandement. Thirdly, as it is without the example and practise of the ancient Church. Fourthly, as it disagrees from the practise of the Reformed Churches.

                  After yee haue laid downe your grounds; some for sitting▪ and some against kneeling: yee subioyne the tenor of the acte concluded at Perth, but most corruptly, as we haue noted in the margine; and then yee forme this argument: That which hath been established by so many lawes Ciuill and Ecclesiasticall, by so long custome, and prescription of time, and confirmed by oathes and subscriptions, we may not lawfully alter: But so it is, that sitting at Table, in the acte of receiuing, hath beene established by lawes, customes, long prescription of time, and confirmed by oathes and subscriptions.
                  A man that had heard the proposition only, would expect some great matter in the assumption, belonging to some article of Faith, or precept of obedience set downe in Gods Word: and all resolues in an indifferent ceremonie of sitting at the Sacrament. But yet to make simple people beleeue, that it were some necessary or substantiall point of Religion, that might not be altered, ye make a great shew of lawes, customes, &c, which being examined, shall vanish as smoake before the winde. And where yee beginne with a strong alleageance, that it was established with so many lawes Ciuill and Ecclesiasticall: I aske you first, by what Ciuill lawes? Yee say, (so many) yet in your deduction, whereby you affirme the assumption to be euident, yee cite not one law, neither can yee, albeit yee are not ashamed to say (so many). For your Ecclesiasticall lawes, yee cite first, the words set downe

in the second head of the first booke of Discipline; the Table of the Lord is then rightly ministred, &c. These words are not a law, for that booke of Discipline was neuer receiued, nor confirmed, either by the Ciuill, or Ecclesiasticall estate; some of the Nobility subscribed it, but others, who had the chiefe authority, as Master Knox complaines in his History, reiected the same, calling it Deuout imaginations. Next, yee cite the ordinance of the generall Assembly, 1562, appointing the order of Geneua to be obserued: this Act cannot establish your sitting, for in Geneua, they stand, or passe, as they Receiue, and sit not at Table. The last Acte, which yee cite in anno 1564, ordaineth Ministers in the ministration of the Sacraments, to vse the order set downe in the Psalme book. In that Act there is no mention of sitting, and by the order set downe in the Psalme bookes, that may be meant, which before was called, the order of Geneua. How soeuer it be, there is no particular law for sitting, no Ciuil law at all: and none Ecclesiasticall; but this onely one, which is generall.
                  Your second probation is, That sitting is established by so long a custome and prescription of time: Who would not, when he heares (so long) looke at least for a three or foure hundred yeares? and all this length of time yee can alledge to, is since the yeare of God 1560, not halfe an age: before which time, kneeling was in vse many hundred yeares on the Lords day, and on other dayes in the weeke, euer since the first Institution, as afterwards shall be proued, with better reasons, then any yee can bring for the necessity of sitting▪ This long custome and prescription for kneeling, yee esteeme to be of no moment, albeit it was a gesture instituted by God: but for sitting, a gesture instituted by man; yee count eight and fifty yeares a long prescription. So men esteeme their owne Dwarfes to be Giants, Nostrum sic nanum Atlanta vocamus.
                  
                  
                     The last argument wherein yee glory most, is, that sitting is confirmed by oathes and subscriptions: This is a childish and false alledgeance: for there was neuer oath, nor subscription giuen in our Church, that by any consequence can import a confirmation of sitting, or of any other indifferent alterable ceremonie, for all times following. Seeing no man is astricted longer vnto the obseruatiō of it, then the Ecclesiasticall Constitution stands, which being altered by the Church that made it, their oath and subscription bindes them to obserue that, which in stead of the former, is ordained to be receiued. This is manifest by the Constitutions set downe in the seuenteenth chapter of the booke of Discipline, receiued and confirmed in the generall Assembly holden at Glasgow the 24. of Aprill, anno 1581, the tenor whereof followes: The finall end of all Assemblies, is first to keepe the Religion and Doctrine in purity, without errour or corruption. Next to keepe comlinesse and good order in the Church: for this orders cause, they may make certaine rules and c
                           •
                        nstitutions, pertaining to the good behauiour of all the members of the Church in their owne vocation: They haue power also to abrogate and abolish all statutes and ordinances, concerning Ecclcsiasticall matters, that are found noysome and vnprofitable, and agree not with the time, or are abused by the people. And after a few words, it is subioyned: That it appertaines to the Presbyteries, to cause the Ordinances made by the Assemblies Prouinciall and generall, to be kept and put in execution. Hereby it is manifest, that when the Church alters indifferent thing in policie, that they who are astricted by their oathes to obey the Discipline of the Church, are tyed, both not to practise these things, which the Church hath discharged; and to obserue these things, which the Church, in stead thereof, hath established to be done. Whereupon I conclude, That so many as haue sworne and subscribed, (after the forme contained in the Oath) to continue in the obedience of the Discipline of the Church; are all obliged by their subscriptions, now

not to sit, but to kneele at the Communion: because the Church hath found it meete, that sitting should bee interchanged with kneeling? Thus I haue answered your reasons, lawes, customes, subscriptions and oathes, which yee bring for sitting.
                  I come to consider the ordinances made, as ye alledge, against kneeling: where first yee alledge an Act made in the Assembly 1591, that an Article should bee formed, and presented vnto his Maiesty, and the Estates, for order to be taken with them, who giue or receiue the Sacraments after the Papistical manner; but by Papistical maner is meante, the giuing of the Sacrament by a Masse Priest, and the receiuing the same after the order of the Romane Church: which may be cleared by an Act of the Assembly, anno 1565. Decemb.

                     Persons reuolting from the profession of the Gospell, by offering their children to be baptized after the Papisticall maner, or by themselues receiuing the Sacrament of the Altar, after admonition, shall bee excommunicate, if repentance interuene not. This sheweth what is meant by giuing, or receiuing the Sacrament in a Papisticall manner; for it was neuer our Churches meaning, to censure these that receiued the Sacraments after the manner of the Reformed Churches in France, England, or Germany, where many of our people haue receiued the Sacrament of Christs bodie kneeling: Nor did our Predecessors euer condemne their customes, and esteeme sitting necessary, albeit for the estate of our Church, they held it in the beginning to be most conuenient.
                  Next, yee say, That in the Kings Confession of Faith, &c. are these words contained: We detest the ceremonies of the Romane Antichrist, added to the ministration of the Sacraments▪ and we detest all his rites, signes, and traditions. This argument were good, if yee did proue kneeling to be a rite or ceremony added to the Sacrament, by the Roman Antichrist. But we know this ceremony to be diuine, and

not Antichristian, a ceremony allowed by God to bee vsed in his worship: for he hath said expresly in his Word, Vnto me all knees shall bow: and againe, In the name of Iesus euery knee shall bow. Neither will yee euer be able to proue the vse of this ceremony, in receiuing the Sacrament, to be Antichristian; or to haue been instituted by the Antichrist of Rome: for albeit Honori
                           •
                        s ordained that the people should kneele at the eleuation, and circumgestation of the Hoste to those who are sicke, yet he made no constitution for kneeling at the receiuing of the Sacrament: and there is as great difference betweene the eleuation in the Masse, and the pompous circumgestation of the Hoste▪ and the celebration of the Sacrament, as is betwixt an idolatrous, and superstitious inuention of man, and a lawfull act of diuine worship. Therefore to conclude the answere of this Section, vnto the argument propounded by you, I oppone this.
                  
                     Euery indifferent alterable ceremony, the innouation and abrogation whereof, is thought expedient by the Church, may be lawfully altered, notwithstanding of any lawes, customes, oathes, or subscriptions formerly made, for obseruation therof▪ 
                        for a time.
                     
                     But sitting at the Sacrament is an indifferent alterable ceremony, the innouation and abrogation whereof, is thought expedient by the Church.
                     
                        Ergo, Sitting at the Sacrament may be lawfully altered, notwithstanding of any lawes, customes, oathes, or subscriptions formerly made for obseruation thereof, for a time.
                     
                  
                  The Proposition is manifest by these Constitutions, which we haue cited out of the seuenteenth chapter of the booke of Discipline, confirmed in the Assembly, 1581, and subscribed by many of the Ministry. Yea, the very nature of alterable ceremonies is such, that to the obseruation of them no man is longer astricted, then they stand in their integritie without change; but if for any

corruption and abuse, or for some greater or better respect, they be altered by the Church, the obligation for obseruing of them ceases, and bindes no more.
                  As to kneeling, which the Assembly hath ordained in stead of sitting, as yet we haue seene nothing against it, neither Law Ciuill or Ecclesiasticall▪ nor custome, &c. And I hope the reasons yee bring hereafter shal be found is friuolous. But keeping your order, I will first consider,

                  The first breach of the institution by kneeling, is, the taking away of that commendable gesture of sitting, vsed by Christ and his Apostles, at, and after the Institution.

                     itting. This is your reasoning▪

                  ANS.
                  Your argument is, a captione â fallacia consequentis: For albeit nothing interuened betweene the eating of the Paschall Supper, and the celebration of the Sacrament, yet it followeth not▪ that the Sacrament was ministred vnto them sitting. For as yee say, their eating of the Paschall Supper and sitting were coniunct; and that eating of the Paschall Supper ceasing at the beginning of the institution of this Sacrament; how will it follow, that the gesture of sitting continued, and was not changed? For although nothing interuened betweene the Paschall Supper and the Sacrament, yet the gesture might haue beene

changed, when the action was changed. And as the one action ceased when the other began, so the gesture of sitting might haue ceased with the action, wherewith it was conioyned: and another gesture might haue begun, and been vsed in the celebration of the Sacrament▪ Moreouer, betwixt their eating of the Paschall Supper, and the administration of the Sacrament to the Disciples, there interuened diuers actes; as first, the taking of the bread▪ secondly, the thankesgiuing: thirdly, the breaking: fourthly, the precept, Take yee, eate yee: fiftly, the word whereby the element was made the Sacrament. After this, the Sacrament was giuen by our Sauiour, and receiued by the Disciples, which yee call the ministration of the Sacrament vnto them. Now albeit it were true, that between the time they sate eating of the Paschall Supper, and the time when the Sacrament began to bee celebrated, nothing had interuened: yet betwixt that, and the ministring of the Sacrament to the Disciples, all these fiue acts interuened. In which time, the gesture of sitting might haue beene changed: for if they changed it not at the breaking of the bread by our Sauiour, which was the first act, yet they might haue changed it at the thankesgiuing, which was the second; or at the breaking, which was the third; or at Christs pronouncing of the words, whereby the element became a Sacrament. So vpon this ground, that they were sitting, and eating, yee cannot conclude, that they receiued the Sacrament sitting; seeing betwixt the time of their eating of the Paschall Supper, so many acts interuened, wherein the gesture of sitting might haue beene changed, before they receiued the Sacrament. Thus it is not certaine, that they sate, and receiued the Sacrament, or, as yee say, that the Sacrament was ministred vnto them sitting. If it be replied, that it is not written, that they rose, and altered their gesture: I answere, à non scriptum, ad non factum est, non valet consequentia. It is not written, that they altered their gesture,

                  PP.
                  That sitting was instituted, I proue it by two reasons: first, the gesture, that Christ retained in passing from the conclusion of the Paschall Supper, That hee did institute sitting hee retained, Therefore he did institute sitting.

                  This is a Demonstration, whereupon the faith and obedience of the worthy Receiuers must be grounded, touching the gesture they must vse at Communion: yet the Libeller perceiuing, that the proposition of this argument may be denyed, and being denied, that it must be proued by this generall; Whatsoeuer Christ retained, that he did institute: and considering withall, that Christ retained many things, as the place, the quality of the bread, and circūstance of time, which he dare not affirme to haue bin instituted; hee makes exception of such things, as were retained of necessity, and could not conueniently bee changed. And thereupon subioynes this saying.

                     n standing, or kneeling, if it had not been his minde, that we should receiue the Sacrament of the Eucharisticall

Supper, with the same gesture that the Iewes receiued the Paschall. Now I assume, But the Iewes this night receiued the Paschall Supper, not sitting right vp in chaires or fourmes, as we do, but lying on beds; although that both the gestures might haue been, and were vsed by them in other nights, as is manifest by the testimonie which you cite your selfe out of SCALIGER, De emendatione temporum, lib. 6. Quòd in omnibus alijs noctibus tam 
                           •
                        dentes, quàm bibentes, vel sedemus, vel discumbimus, in hac autem omnes discumbimus. That is to say, Other nights, eating or drinking, we either sit at table, or lye; This night we all lye (yee turne it, we all suppe, that is, sit leaning.) Thus then I reason vpon the ground of your owne demonstration: The gesture of lying, vsed by our Sauiour at the Paschal Supper, according to the custom of the Iewes, might haue easily and commodiously been changed, without working a miracle, by turning about his face and body to the Table, and setting of himselfe right vpon the beddes, with his feete to the ground, as our custome is to sitte at table. Therefore, according to your owne principle, it was not Christs minde, that we should sitte vpright at table, as wee doe, and all the Iewes in those dayes vsed to doe at other times; but that wee should lye at table, as the Iewes did at the Supper of the Passeouer. Now let the judicious Reader consider, if this be a sure ground, whereupon to settle a certaine and infallible point of Gods worship. But I conuert the argument.
                  
                     Nothing vsed at the Paschall Supper, and retained at the Sacrament, that is not expressed in the words of the Institution, was instituted.
                     But sitting vsed in the Paschall Supper, retained, as yee alledge, at the Sacrament, is a thing not expressed in the words of the Institution.
                     Therefore sitting vsed at the Paschall Supper, and retained, &c. was not instituted.

                  PP.
                  Wherefore doth the Apostle propound the custome of the first Churches, 1. Cor. 11.16. 2. Tim. 3.14. 1. Cor. 14.33. if they did not oblige vs to imitation?

                  More impertinent testimonies yee could not haue brought, then the last two, and if they be rightly cited, let the Reader iudge: to the first, wherein mention is made of the custome of the Churches, I answere: If the custome of the Church, and the actions and practises of Christ be morall, and of the nature of things commanded generally in the Decalogue, they oblige vs indeed to imitation; but naturall actions, such as eating, drinking, waking, sleeping, resting, talking, and such like done by them, with the circumstances thereof; namely, the manner, time, and place, of their eating, drinking, &c. doe not tye vs to the imitation of them, although there bee no cause mouing them thereto, which concernes vs not. Therefore in all things we are not obliged to their imitation. Neither doe the ceremonies and circumstances obserued by them in the exercise of Religion, astrict vs, except they be enioyned by some constant precept in the Gospell: as by example, Iohn baptised at a riuer, and they who were baptised went downe into the water, and came vp out of it againe: in some places the Church vsed a threefold immersion: in the Apostles time, they vsed to salute one another with a holy kisse: they kept their banquets of loue at their meetings, and other moe customes they had, which not being enioyned to vs by a constant command, doe no wise oblige vs: as no more

doth the circumstance of place, time, habite, persons, position, and site of body, as standing, sitting or walking. And in a word, in the actions of Christ, his Apostles, or the customes of the Church, there is nothing exemplary, and left to be imitated of vs, but that which either being morall

This place is interpreted by Augustine, Paulinus, &c. But so it is, they wete sitting when Christ gaue them the bread: whatsoeuer be the interpretation of the Text, yee see, they acknowledge sitting at the Table.

                  I see not, that they did acknowledge the Disciples to haue sate at Table, when they receiued: for as I said before, there interuened betweene the taking of the bread by Christ, and the receiuing of the same by the Disciples, the act of thankesgiuing, breaking and giuing the bread, in which time, the gesture of sitting might haue beene altered. Thus it is not certaine, that they sate at the Receiuing. If yee reply: it is not written that they did alter the gesture of sitting: to that I answere before, and it is the Papists argument against the giuing of the Cup to the Layickes; it is not written, say they, that the Cup was giuen, in this place: Therefore, &c. Also yee know, that the time of Christ his sitting heere with his Disciples at Emmaus, was the night season, the place, a priuate Inne: that the breaking and giuing of that bread, was before or after another ordinary supper; and that onely men

were there present▪ and not women: all which points being certaine, according to your first reason, whereby yee

                  To proue that the Apostolike Church sate at Table, you bring the comparison, that the Apostle makes betweene the partaking of the Lords Table, and the table of Diuels: and the partaking of the table of Diuels, you say, was by a formall sitting at table in the house of the Idoll: for which yee alledge Ionathan the Chaldee Paraphrast, vpon the eight verse of the second chapter of Amos; but neither the Text, nor his interpretation proues the formall sitting yee speake of: for the text saith, they laid themselues downe vpon clothes by euery Altar, and not, that they sate: And the Paraphrast, as Mercerus expounds him, saith, That those clothes were Parapetasma
                        
                           •
                        a, that is, couerings or mattes, whereupon they laid themselues downe, and not sate, by euery Altar, and not in the Idols house. And for the place of the Apostle:
Yee cannot be partakers of the Table of the Lord, and of the table of Diuels, there is no materiall or artificiall table vnderstood, either by the one Table or the other; and by participation, formall sitting is not meant.
This is manifest by these words, Yee cannot be partakers: for certaine it is, that they might haue sitten formally at table in the house of the Idoll, and eaten of their sacrifices, and might also haue sitten at the Lords Table formally, and receiued the external elements. But the Apostle saith, That these two Tables, and the participation of them are so opposed, as they could not be partakers of both. Therfore by the table of Diuels in that place we vnderstand the sacrifices offered to Diuels, and by participation, we vnderstand the eating of these sacrifices, with a conscience toward the Idoll, where euer it was done, whether in the Idols Temple, as 1. Cor. 8.10. or in the priuate houses of Idolaters, as 1. Cor. 10.27.28. And by the Table of

the Lord, we vnderstand the body and blood of our Sauiour in the Sacrament, and by the partaking of the Lords Table, the spirituall eating and drinking of his flesh and bloud in the Sacrament, by a true and liuely faith. These two Tables, and partakings could not stand together. And so by the Table of the Lord, the Apostle meanes not a material table, at which the Communicants sate, but the body of Christ in the Sacrament. According to this Causabone in his Exercitations against Baronius, 16.36. citing these words, Non potestis mensae Domini participes esse, &c. saith, Hîc mensa Domini, est ipsa Eucharistia, quam exemplo Pauli, Patresita saepè nominant. That is, The Table of the Lord in this place, is the Eucharist it selfe, which the Fathers often call by this name of the table, following Saint Pauls example. Now where yee adde, that the people of Israel sate downe to eate and drinke at the feast of the golden Calfe: I am assured, yee thinke not, that the Israelites had a materiall table, at which they sate in that feast, so as their sitting will make nothing for the formall sitting, which yee would conclude. And for that which yee tell vs of the Loue feasts, that people sate at them, and that yee cannot thinke they rose from the table to receiue the Sacrament; yee must know, that your thoughts are no probation: and whatsoeuer yee thinke, it is the Apostles expresse minde, that they who discerne not the body of the Lord from that, and all other carnall feasts, are guilty of his body.
And if yee thinke these holy mysteries were worthily receiued, if after the same manner, and at the same time and table, they receiued without making discretion between the one feast and the other, yee thinke not according to the truth: 
                        Nam hîc coena à mysterijs toto genere diuersa erat: as Causabone speakes in the same booke of his Exercitations, 16.31.
Then to conclude, neither haue yee proued that the Apostles, or Apostolike Church receiued the Sacrament sitting formally at a table; nor if they sate, that their sitting was exemplary: for

                        
                        Whatsoeuer is exemplary in Christ his actions, or in the Apostles, or in the Apostolike Churches, is either morall, and commanded in the Decalogue generally; or then it is some action, or circumstantiall ceremony of Religion, enioyned by precept in the Gospell.
                        But sitting at the Sacrament is neither morall, and so commanded in the Decalogue; or is it an action or circumstantiall ceremony of Religion, enioyned by precept in the Gospell.
                        Therefore sitting at the Sacrament is not exemplary, and left vs to be imitated, by Christ, his Apostles, or the Apostolike Churches.
                     
                  
                  And although yee had demonstrated, which neither by Scripture or antiquity, yee will euer be able to doe, That Christ and his Apostles did sitte at the receiuing of the Sacrament, could it oblige vs to the like, as I cleared before?
               
               
                  PP.
                  It is obiected, that the sitting of Christ and his Apostles was not vpright, but sitting with leaning. If wee imitate the example of Christ, wee should sitte after the same manner. Answere, It was the custome receiued amongst the Iewes before, and in the dayes of Christ, descending from the Romanes, or as others alledge, from the Persians, &c.
               
               
                  ANS.
                  The reply yee make to this obiection is long, and needeth not to be repeated; for the gesture being vncertain, wherewith the Apostles receiued; and sitting neyther being instituted by Christ, nor exemplary to vs; as I haue before shewed, whether they sate vpright, or with leaning, none of the formes is necessary to bee vsed. So all your following Discourse is idle, and to no purpose; specially where yee say, That sitting was a custome brought into the Church by Christ, whose example being seconded with the practise of the Apostles, is equiualent vnto a precept; and that it is safer for a mans conscience

to imitate Christ and his Apostles, then to depart from them, and imitate the custome of Churches which may erre: for yee haue neither proued sitting to be an Apostolike practise, not yet to be exemplary; and all your reasons brought for that purpose, haue appeared to be of no force. Yet two things I note in this your answere: first yee say, That the Iewes did receiue their forme of sitting from the Romanes and Persians; and in this yee erre: for it is manifest, by the sixt of Amos, That before they conuersed either with Romanes or Persians, that forme of gesture was vsed amongst them. Next, when yee say, that there is little difference betweene the one fashion of sitting, and the other, that is also false: for it differeth as farre from our forme of sitting, as lying doth: as is cleared by these words of Amos 6.4. They lye vpon beds of Iuory, and stretch themselues vpon their couches. And by that verse of IVVENAL Sat. 1.

                  Where, I pray you, shew me, what yee call (all this?) will yee haue (all) to comprehend, not the actions only, which are set downe in the Institution, as the taking, the blessing, the breaking, the giuing, &c. but the circumstances likewise, as the time, the place, the order, the persons, the site and position of body, and the habit? Then (hoc facite) must import, doe this in the night season, doe it in an vpper chamber, doe it after supper, do it with an

vpper garment vpon you, doe it with faire cleane washen feete, doe it with vnleauened bread, doe it with men, and not with women; doe it being thirteene persons in number, one Giuer, and twelue Receiuers; and doe it with this gesture and position of body, which now yee vse. Heere, all being certaine, the gesture only is vncertaine: some question is made of the number of the Receiuers, because some thinke that Iudas went out, after he got the soppe, before the Sacrament: all the rest are expressed in the story; but whether the Disciples sate, or stood, or kneeled, at the thankesgiuing in the receiuing, no man knowes. We were accustomed, and still are, to kneele at the thankesgiuing, if we did imitate the Apostles herein, they haue also kneeled, and then it is very vncertaine, whether they sate at the Receiuing: But if wee doe not imitate their gesture in the thankesgiuing, it is cleare that we neuer esteemed the imitation of the Apostolike gesture at the thanksgiuing, to be comprised in the precept, hoc facite, which yee interpret, doe all this.

                  Whatsoeuer yee thinke, the faithfull will beleeue, that the Apostle setting downe, as hee doth in that place, the true forme of keeping the Lords Supper, would neuer haue omitted the gesture, if the same had been a part of the Institution, and if he had receiued any thing touching that from the Lord, he had without all question deliuered the same to the Corinthians. As for your instance of a Table, if yee vnderstand thereby a materiall table, appointed for feasters to sitte at, such a table is not necessary, as shalbe cleared in the answer to the second breach:

but if by a Table yee vnderstand a commodious part, whereon the elements must bee placed, then the table must be reckoned amongst the necessary circumstances, that accompany the action: for when Christ commanded to doe this, the command did insinuate, That they must conuene in some place to doe it, that there must be a Pastor to giue, and some persons to receiue; that the elements which are giuen and taken, must be placed in some commodious part, on which they may bee consecrated with thankesgiuing, and blessing, where they may bee broken, and where they may be giuen and receiued: such a table is necessary, yet, what the matter, the forme, and quality of this table should be, is no where expressed in the Scripture, but as the time when, and the place where, and the particular persons to whom, and by whom the Sacrament shall bee celebrate: so the particular matter and forme of the Table is not mentioned in the Institution, but omitted with the rest of the necessary circumstances, and left to be determined by the Church, according to the rule of edification and decencie, and is onely insinuated, as a thing necessarily enioyned with the actions prescribed in the command: for when the Apostle saith, doe this, albeit he saith not, doe it at night, or in the morning, or in a priuate or publike place, by such a person and congregation, and such a part or Table, or with such gesture: yet the command imports, that it should bee done at a conuenient time, in a conuenient place, by meete and qualified persons, with a conuenient gesture, and on a conuenient Table, or on somewhat in stead of a Table. Now, what should be conuenient in such things, it could not be defined; for conueniency changes, according to times, ages and nations: The specification thereof, is left to the wise iudgement of the Church, according to charitie, quam si moderatricem patiemur, saith CALV

                  Yee appeare in this place, to haue forgotten that which you affirmed in the beginning of your dispute, to wit, That nothing interuened betweene the celebration of the Sacrament, and the eating of the Paschall Supper: for now you say, That our Sauiour, no doubt, instructed them how to eate and drinke, before they were commanded to eate and drinke, that is, in your minde, he taught them to conuene themselues, and set them downe at Table: but I alledge, he taught them to stand or kneele ar the receiuing, which wee know certainly to haue bin the practise of the Churches thereafter: What warrant haue you more for the one, then I haue for the other? The Papists will say, that hee taught them the doctrine of Transubstantiation, and the Sacrifice of the Masse, and all the ceremonies vsed at that action, which being after knowne to the Churches by practise, are omitted by Saint Paul and the Euangelists, when they wrote of the Sacrament▪ because, as yee say, they presupposed these things to bee knowne. So farre are yee miscaried with the loue of your darling, Table gesture, that for establishing and authorising the same, yee dare alledge vnwritten verities, whereupon the Church of Rome founds all her heresies. But to conclude, against your false Assertion, I forme you this reason:

                        Whatsoeuer is of necessary vse in the Sacrament, is expressed in the words of the Institution, or then is annexed vnto that which is expressed, as a necessary circumstance belonging thereto.
                        
                           But sitting, is neither expressed in the words of the institution, nor is annexed to that, which is expressed as a necessary circumstance belonging thereto.
                        Therefore sitting is not of necessary vse in the Sacrament.
                     
                  
               
               
                  PP.
                  The second breach of the Institution made by kneeling in the act of receiuing, is the taking away the vse of a table. Christ and his Apostles sate at Table, 1. Cor. 10. Luk. 2
                        •
                     . Wherefore serueth the name of a Table, if wee keepe not the proper vse, and employment of it? The Fathers call it the Lords Table, the heauenly Table, the sacred Table, the mysticall Table, the spirituall Table, the rationall Table. Whereto serue all these commendations, if in the meane time it be not vsed as a Table, but rather as an Altar? if it be not vsed, as Christ and his Apostles vsed it, that is, by sitting at it, to receiue the dainties set vpon the Table? And a little after; The people of God had an Altar for the Sacrifice, and a Table for a Feast. Such like the Ethnickes: so Christians haue an Altar for a Sacrifice, to wit, Christ who is Priest, Altar, and Sacrifice, Heb. 13.10. And a Table for the Feast, after this Sacrifice once made, to wit, the Sacrament of the Supper. As the Israelites, and the Ethnickes sate at the table of their feasts, so doe we at our sacred Feasts, to distinguish betweene an Altar and a Table, a Sacrifice and a Supper made of the thing sacrificed; a dresser or cupboord may serue as well for the disposing of the elements, &c.

                  I must take paines heere for clearing your minde, to draw your arguments together, which are set downe, 
                        
                           •
                        anquam scopae dissolutae, as loose or euill knit beesomes: yee proue that kneeling taketh away the vse of a table, because the proper vse of a table is for sitting. This yee qualifie, because Christ and his Apostles sate at Table: And because the Iewes, and the Ethnickes sate at their

feasts made of things sacrificed. And this is your first argument: Your next is, because sitting makes a distinction betweene an Altar and a Table, betweene a Supper and a Sacrifice. For answere to your first argument, I say, it is a meere caption, à fallacia consequentis: for albeit that Christ and his Apostles, the Iewes and the Ethnicks sate at their feasts, it followeth not, that the proper vse of a table is sitting. The proper vse of a table, is to hold and sustaine the meat that is set thereon: beds in these dayes were ordained for sitting, fourmes, chaires, and bonkers in our times: the taking away of sitting, takes away the vse of the beds, fourmes, and seates whereon they sate, but not the vse of the table: this still remaines, if the elements be placed thereon, and consecrate in the celebration of the Sacrament, albeit no man sitte thereat. As to Christ and the Apostles, the Iewes and the Ethnicks, they sate at their feasts, when they did eate their sacrifices, because these feasts were sufficient bodily repasts; at which they spent long time in eating, drinking, and conference: For the ease of their bodies, sitting, lying, or such like a gesture was necessary; but our Sacrament, which is wholly finished, by receiuing a morsell of bread, and a very little wine, requires not a long time, nor such an easefull gesture for the body. It is vncertaine, as I shewed before, what kinde of gesture our Sauiour and the Apostles vsed; and if they sate, it was occasioned by the former Supper, and no wise requisite for the Sacrament, neither for ease of the body, the action being quickly ended; neither for conference, for there was none vsed thereat: neither for receiuing the dainties, or the elements from the table, by stretching out their hands. As to the bread, Scaliger saith, that the custome was, of the Master of the feast, to breake the bread in so many peeces, as the number of the feasters were: and vnto euery one a peece was giuen, as great as an Oliue: or if yee reiect his authority, whom yee formerly cited in the booke of Discipline,

1560, which yee make the ground of your order, it is said, the bread was broken by our Sauiour, and deliuered to him who sate next, and that they brake, and deliuered each to his neighbour▪ Likewise that they diuided the cup amongst them, after our Sauiour had giuen the same; so they stretched not forth their hands to take the elements from the table; and their sitting at table for these ends was needlesse.
                  To your second argument I answere: the distinction of the Table from the Altar is not made by sitting, but by the employments proper to them. The Altar was ordained for the sanctifying of the oblations made to God, the Table to hold and sustaine such things as are offered, and giuen to vs, according to Christs Institution. The Priest stood at the Altar when he offered, and the people when they praied: so the Communicants in the Primitiue Church stood at the Table, when they receiued the Sacrament on the Lords day, and this conformity in gesture tooke not away the difference between the Altar and the Table, as no more doth kneeling, or any other gesture. But to come to the ground, whereupon yee build this reason, yee say, the people of God had an Altar for the Sacrifice, and a table for the feast: So Christians haue Christ for the Altar and the Sacrifice, and a Communion Table for the Sacrament, which is their feast. This your comparison hath some shew, but no solidity. There is a correspondence, I grant, betweene the Iewish Altar, and Christ, who was the Altar that did sacrifice himselfe, to be a Sacrifice for the sinnes of the world; for the Iewish Altar was the type, and Christ the verity. But what correspondence is there, betweene the tables whereon the Iewes did eate their sacrifices, and the Communion Table? The tables whereon they did eate their sacrifices, were not holy instruments, which appertained to the Tabernacle and Temple, but such as they had in their owne priuate houses; and therefore were not types, which did

eyther signifie our Communion Tables, or whereunto our Communion Tables doe answere, as anti-types▪ for it is to be obserued, that in Christian Religion there is nothing which hath any necessary correspondence, or relation to the Legall ceremonies, but that which is either the verity of some type, or the antitype of some type. As for example, betweene Christ, and the Leuitical Priest, the Altar, and the Sacrifice, there is relation as betweene the type and the verity: so betweene Circumcision and Baptisme, the Passeouer and the Lords Supper, there is relation, as betweene the type and the antitype; for our Sacraments haue succeeded these, and are in their stead. But as to the Table, whereon the Passeouer and other sacrifices were eaten, the same not being a sacred instrument, or type appointed by God, as hath been said, there is nothing in Christian Religion answering thereto, either as the verity it selfe, or as an antitype succeeding thereto. As therefore their tables were not necessary for eating of their sacrifices (for it is certaine, the Iewes were not a stricted by any diuine ordinance to sitte at Table, when they did eate the Passeouer, and their other Sacrifices) but were only commodious receptacles deuised by themselues, which they might haue altered and interchanged as they thought meet: Euen so, a materiall artificiall table for celebration of this Sacrament, is not an instrument appointed by our Sauiour, as the Altars and Tables of Shew-bread, but the same is appointed by the Church, according to that power which shee hath to determine circumstances for the actions of diuine worship. To the disposing of the elements, some such receptacle and subiect is necessary, as a table, and decency requires it, when, and where the same may be had; but it is not of such a necessary vse, as the Altar vnder the Law, for without an Altar, a sacrifice could not be offered, but without any such table, the Sacrament hath often been ministred. Euagrius lib. 6. hist. cap. 13. records, That Gregorius Pastor

of Antiochia did minister the Sacrament to the Souldiers on the grasse, before the 600. yeare of our Lord: at Ban
                        
                           •
                        ock burne in the dayes of King Robert Bruce, the like was done to the Scottish army on the fields, and so at many other times, when a table commodiously could not be had. Finally, where yee adde, That for disposing of the elements, a dresser or cupboord may serue, these speeches smell of profanity; as if to hold and sustaine the elements were such a base employment, that the instrument wheron the Church thought meet they should be placed, should neither be a table, nor named a table. And yet all these religious Epithets, which yee alledge the Fathers gaue to the Communion, as when they called it the Lords Table, the heauenly Table, the sacred Table, &c. were giuen to it, not because the Communicants did sitte thereat, or for any other gesture of body vsed by them, but because the Lords body, the bread of heauen, the sacred, mysticall, and spirituall food of our soules, were presented thereon in the holy Sacrament. Causabone Exercit. 16.36. saith, That by these appellations, the Eucharist it selfe was vnderstood. But heere it is manifest, that the Epithets interiected in your discourse, are not only impertinent, but repugnant to the opinion yee hold: For when yee aske, why is it called a table, if men sit not at it? they answer you, Because vpon that table, the heauenly, sacred, and spirituall mysteries are set. In respect thereof, it is called a heauenly, spirituall, sacred, and mysticall table. In the dayes of Chrysostome and Theodoret, by whom these Epithets were most frequently giuen to the Sacrament, there was not a table in the Churches, at which men did sitte, but one onely, on which the elements were placed, and consecrate: but yee neuer fall vpon the name of a Table sooner, then yee imagine it was appointed for sitting. And what then thinke yee of the Table of Shew-bread, at which no man did sit? Shall it not be called a Table, because it lacked your employment of sitting, or table gesture?

In all Reformed Churches of Europe, (our Church and very few excepted) the Communion Tables haue no employment, but only to hold, and sustaine the elements: This is to be seen in the Churches of France, Germany, Hungary, Pole, and England. And in the Greeke Church Causabone obserues, that there are two Tables, one whereupon the elements are set before the Consecration, and another wherupon they are Consecrate. Thus haue I sufficiently declared, that the only or chiefe vse at least of the Communion Table, is for the setting and disposing of the elements, and the consecration of them, with the distribution of the same. Now, that by kneeling in the act of receiuing, the vse of the Communion table is not taken away, I proue by this reason.
                  
                     Whatsoeuer gesture taketh not away the comely placing, and decent consecration of the sacramentall elements on the Communion Table, from which they may bee giuen and receiued, that taketh not away the vse of the Communion Table.
                     But kneeling is a gesture, that taketh not away the comely placing, and decent consecration of the sacramentall 
                           •
                        lements on the Communion Table, from which they may be giuen, and receiued.
                     Therefore kneeling taketh not away the vse of the Communion Table.

                  The third breach of the Institution made by kneeling, is the taking away of that mysticall rite representing Christs Passion, to wit, the breaking of the bread, &c.

                  If your meaning be, that the Pastor breaketh not the bread before he giue it, yee bely vs. Wee know that it is the Pastors part in the action, to represent Christ the breaking of his body on the Crosse, with the sorrowes of death for our sinnes; therefore we obserue that rite religiously.

But if your meaning be, that the people breakes not euery one with another in reuerence and sobrietie, as is prescribed in the second Chapter of the first Booke of Discipline set foorth 1560. that shall be discussed in the answere to the sixth breach.
               
               
                  PP.
                  The fourth breach of the Institution made by kneeling, is the change and restraint of the commandement, giuen to many in the plurall number, Eate yee, drinke yee: to one in the singular number, Eate thou, drinke thou.
                  
               
               
                  ANS.
                  This is a calumny, we neither change the command, nor so much as a iot contained in the institution: For, first, wee consecrate the Elements, vsing the words of Saint Paul, and the Euangelists, without altering a sillable. Thereafter, when we giue the Elements seuerally to euery person, wee apply the generall command to euery one in particular, which if we did not, euery worthy receiuer ought to apply vnto himselfe, else he cannot communicate in faith; for he that esteemes not, that command to belong to himselfe in particular, hath no warrant for his taking, eating, and drinking. This application therefore made by the Pastor to euery communicant, is not a breach, but a meane, seruing to the right and precise obseruation of the Institution.
               
               
                  PP.
                  The fift breach of the institution made by kneeling is, the altering of the enunciatiue words of Christ, This is my body which is broken for you: This is my bloud which is shed for you, in a prayer, To blesse our body and soule, saying, The body of our Lord Iesus Christ, &c.
                  
               
               
                  ANS.
                  This also is a calumny, for these words wee vse not in stead of the sacramentall words, because then there should be no Sacrament at all: for by the sacramentall word, This is my body, the bread is made the Sacrament

of Christs body: and by this word, This Cuppe is the New Testament in my bloud, the Cuppe is made the Sacrament of his Bloud; and without this word, whereby the will of our Sauiour is declared, which makes the Sacrament, all our prayers and wishes should serue to no vse. It is true, after the Sacrament is made by the sacramentall word, these, or the like words are vttered by the Pastor at the deliuery of the Elements, whereby the generall prayer and blessing, wherewith the action beginnes, is applyed particularly to euery Communicant, and they admonished, and instructed to apply it to themselues. This is the dutie both of the Pastor and of the people: for as in the prayer it is our duetie to wish in generall, that all who are to participate the bodie and bloud of Iesus, may be preserued thereby to euerlasting life: so it is our duetie to wish the same to each one seuerally at the instant when he is receiuing. And as it is the Peoples dutie, when the prayer is conceiued for all, to wish that Christs body and bloud may preserue all the receiuers thereof: so, when they receiue seuerally, to wish, that themselues in particular may be preserued thereby: For, if this be one of the principall ends, wherefore they come to receiue, can they receiue worthily without this or the like wish? No man without blasphemie can call this an idle battologie.
               
               
                  PP.
                  The sixth breach of the Institution made by kneeling, is the taking away of the distribution that ought to be amongst the Communicants. When Christ sayd, Take yee, eate yee, he insinuates, that they should take and diuide amongst themselues. [A little after.] In the first Booke of Discipline, penned Anno. 1560. it is ordained, that the Minister break the bread, and distribute the same to those that bee next him, commanding the rest, euery one, with reuerence and sobrietie to breake with other, because it is neerest to Christs action: further, we haue

a plaine precept, Luke 22.17. Diuide it amongst you, &c.
               
               
                  ANS.
                  If yee stand to that, which yee alleadge out of Scaliger, was the custome of the Iewes, and vsed by our Sauiour in the Institution: yee haue no cause to quarrell the distribution of the bread; for the Master of the feast vsed to breake the bread in so many peeces as the number of the Feasters were, giuing to euery one a peece: neither did each person measure his owne portion, giuing the rest to his neighbour, according to our custome. But leauing this, if we shall consider by the Institution, what part is proper to the Pastor, and what to the People, wee will finde, that as it is the Pastors part to take bread, to blesse, and giue thanks; so is it his part, first, to breake the bread, then to giue it with this precept, Take, eate; and so, that it is the Peoples part not to breake it, but to take it broken: for, as it was the part of Christ, first, to giue his flesh for the life of the World, when he did offer himselfe in a sacrifice for our sinnes, which he will haue represented in the Sacrament by the Pastor in breaking the bread: so it was his part to giue his flesh to the faithfull, not to be broken and sacrificed by them, but to bee eaten, after it was once broken & sacrificed by himselfe. If therefore it be not the part of the people, either to represent the oblation of Christs body, or the donation thereof to vs, but the part of the Pastor properly, who in these actions represents Christ, it cannot be the part of the people to breake the bread, nor to giue the bread one to another. For this cause, in the ancient Church, it was euer giuen, either by the Pastor himselfe, or by his Deacon, who supplied his place, and helped him in the action; but neuer by any of the people to others. And Clemens Alexandrinus in the place which your selfe quotes, saith not, that the people diuided the bread; but that it was permitted to euery one of the people to take a part of the Eucharist, after that some (doubtlesse the Masters

of the Church) had diuided it in peeces, as their custome was. The learned Musculus in his common places, De coena Domini, pag. 444. speaking of this purpose saith; Fregit & dedit Discipulis suis, fregit ipse manu sua panem, ac fractum à se dedit Discipulis: non dedit integrum, & ab ipsis frangendum, sed à se fractum panem. Non dedit vt ipsi distribuerent, sed vt à se distributum acciperent & ederent. Erant Apostoli in ca coena Domini, non vt dispensatores mysteriorum Dei: sed vt conuinae, vt fideles, vt Discipuli, vt Communicantes: Christus verò vt Conuiuator, vt Dominus, eadem opera instituens, ac suiipsius manibus dispensans gratiae suae sacramentum. That is to say, Christ Iesus brake, and gaue to his Disciples: hee brake the bread with his owne hand, and when it was broken he gaue it to his Disciples: he gaue it not whole vnto them, to be broken by them, but he gaue them that which he had broken: he gaue it not to them to be distributed by them, but that they should take it being distributed by him, and eate it. The Apostles were in that Supper not as dispensers of the mysteries of God, but as Guests, as the faithfull, as Disciples, and as Communicants: but Christ was as the maker of the Feast, as the Master, at one time both instituting and dispensing with his owne hand the Sacrament of his grace. Here you see, that Christ is the breaker, the giuer, the distributer of the Bread, and not the Disciples: And so the Pastor is now the breaker, the giuer, the distributer, and not the people. Let the judicious Reader consider, whether the iudgement of this learned man doth better agree with the Institution, or the opinion of the Pamphlet penner: And whether the Pastor, who according to the Institution breakes the bread, and giues it with his owne hands to the people, or they, who giue the bread to the people in whole schaues to bee broken, and distributed by themselues, comes neerer to Christs appointment.
                  But to come to the Cup: If our Sauiour, in giuing of the same, did imitate the custome of the Iewes, which

                     Scaliger and others wrote to haue beene this; that the Master of the Feast, after he had blessed the Cup, did first drinke thereof himselfe, and then gaue it to him who sate next; so as it passed from hand to hand till all had drunken: it seemes, that the Disciples did deliuer the Cup one to another. But there is a great difference betweene the distribution of the Cuppe and the Bread: for the distribution of the Bread is not a diuiding onely of the Bread from hand to hand, but a breaking is conioyned with the distributing: for he that giues to his Neighbour, breakes before he giues. Now in this breaking we know there is a mysterie, which signifies the breaking of the Lords Body; which is an act, as is before made euident, that onely appertaines to Christ, both in the veritie, when he did offer himselfe on the Crosse and in the mysterie, when he did represent his oblation, or the breaking of his body, by the breaking of the bread: and therefore is such an act, as ought onely to be performed by him, who in the Sacrament acteth the part of Christ, and represents him sacrificing himselfe. In distribution of the Cuppe there is no such mysterie: for the giuing of it from hand to hand signifies not the shedding of our Sauiours bloud, but the taking of the Cup by the Pastor, and the drinking thereof, doth represent that Cup which the Father propined to his Sonne, and the Sonne receiued and dranke, when willingly hee suffered his bloud to bee shed on the Crosse for the remission of the sinnes of many, and for confirmation of the new Testament; which Cup, Bloud, and Testament, is in the Sacrament deliuered to the People by the Pastor in Christs name, commanding them to take, and drinke all thereof. He in whose Name this command is vttered, is properly the Giuer and propiner, because by his authoritie it is giuen, and by the warrant of his word it is receiued. When the King drinks to any of his Subiects, and sends it by the hand of his seruant, the seruant is not properly the

giuer and propiner, but the deliuerer of the gift and propine: and therefore, as in the Sacrament, the Pastor when he takes the Cup, and drinks, acteth the part of Christ, and represents him taking and drinking that most bitter Cuppe of his Passion and death for our sinnes: so, when he giues and commands the people to take, and drinke all thereof, he acteth the part of Christ, applying his bloud, and giuing the New Testament confirmed thereby to euery worthy receiuer, whether the same be deliuered immediately to euery one by his owne hand; or if it bee sent by the hand of the Deacon, as is was in the Primitiue Church, or if it be deliuered from hand to hand by the Communicants amongst themselues. But without all question, if the Pastor may commodiously by himselfe make the deliuery, it is most agreeable to the person which hee carries in that holy action, who represents our Sauiour, first, willingly vndergoing death for vs, then, most bountifully applying it to vs with his owne hand.
                  O, but in the 22. of Luke, verse 17. our Sauiour sayd, Take this Cuppe, and diuide it amongst you: The word is, 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , Part it amongst you. Here you trouble your selfe, and the Reader much with a long discourse, prouing that in this place the Eucharisticke Cuppe, and not the Paschall is meant: Yet let it be so. What then? they are commanded to part it amongst them, ergo, to reach it from hand to hand. This followes not; for when euery one takes his owne part of that which is to be parted, they diuide the whole amongst them, although euery one deliuer not with his hand to his neighbour the thing which is to be diuided, or the remanent thereof: as by example; When the Manna, which was gathered in the Wildernesse, was cast together in heapes, and the families came forth, and parted the same amongst them, euery man taking his Homer, which was his part; the Families diuided the whole amongst them, without reaching

from hand to hand the heape which was diuided: so when the Disciples were commanded to diuide the Cup amongst them, if euery one did drinke no more then his owne portion, & did leaue the rest to his fellow, the cō
                     mand was obeyed: albeit when euery one had drunken, the last had set downe the Cup on the Table, or had deliuered it into his hand, from whom he had receiued it; or if one or two had beene maymed, and lacked the vse of their hands, so that the Cup behoued to be holden to their heads; yet if they dranke no more, but their owne part, with respect to their neighbour, who was to drinke after them, they diuided the Cup: for the diuiding is not the giuing of the Cup, but the parting of the wine amongst them, that was in the Cup: So if they did drinke with such moderation, that one, two, or three dranke it not all, but that all did drinke as our Sauiour commanded; howbeit they did not deliuer it one to another, but receiued it seuerally, euery one from Christs owne hand, as wee doe out of the hand of the Pastor, they neuerthelesse diuided the same amongst them. To conclude, the command giuen to the Apostles, importeth, that Poculum benedictionis, is not Poculum ebrietatis, sed charitatis, that is to say, The Cup of blessing, is not the cup of drunkennesse, but the Cup of charity, which should not be carowsed by one, but should be parted amongst many. And therefore these two phrases, the one vsed by Saint LVKE, Diuide it amongst you: and the other by S. MATTHEVV and S. MARKE, Drinke thereof all, and they dranke of it all, are equiualent. As to the giuing and deliuering of the Cup, whether it should be, by the hand of the Pastor, or by the mutuall deliuering of the people one to another, because it is not defined by the Scripture, it is indifferent, and left to bee determined by the Church.
                  These grounds being sure, let vs consider your syllogisme▪ Whatsoeuer action or command is inclosed within the Institution, may not lawfully be broken. But that

the Cōmunicants should distribute amongst themselues, was both an action at the first Supper, and a precept, as hath been proued; Therefore kneeling by consequence is discharged. By what consequence I pray you? Because, say you, that gesture, and this distribution, is no wayes compatible. It is a manifest vntruth; for he that kneeles, may take as well his portion of the wine, and leaue the rest to his neighbour, as he that sittes; and if you thinke that one cannot reach, and deliuer the Cup to his neighbour kneeling beside him, you are deceiued: for I haue seene at one daies seruice a thousand persons, who haue reached the Cup one to another kneeling, as they were accustomed to doe sitting at Table before: yet, as hath been said, that was not necessary, for the precept in the Institution is not, Giue this Cup one to another, but diuide it, or part it amongst you, or drinke all thereof.

                  The seuenth breach of the Institution made by kneeling, is an vnnecessary diuiding of the Communicants, making populous congregations to receiue on many dayes, where they may receiue in one.

                  Where the Congregations are populous, as in Burghes, three, or two dayes at the least, were allowed them. And in those same places where kneeling hath been practised, the seruice hath beene perfected in as short time, as euer it was before, which we know by experience.
               
               
                  PP.
                  The eight breach of the Institution made by kneeling, is, the altering of the purpose of the Institution, or nature of this Sacrament. It was instituted to be a Supper, a spirituall Feast, &c. Therefore the Guests inuited thereto, as you conclude, should not kneele.
               
               
                  ANS.
                  To make good this your imagined breach, you haue borrowed three arguments from your Master of table

gesture. Thereof this is the first, to which I shortly answere, That a common banquet requires a common gesture, such as sitting, and the same is most fitting: but a spirituall banquet requires a spirituall gesture; your selfe doe acknowledge it to be a spirituall Feast, and the most religious gesture, is the most decent in this action: and that is kneeling.
               
               
                  PP.
                  Guests inuited to a banquet, euen to a Princes banquet, kneele not in the act of banquetting.
               
               
                  ANS.
                  A Princes banquet, is but a common carnall banquet, and therefore men should not vse thereat a religious gesture, such as kneeling. Besides, the length of time, which must bee spent at the banquet of a Prince, makes such a gesture inconuenient. But if you were to receiue one morsell of bread, or one drinke, from the hand of the Prince himselfe, you would bee thought vnciuill, if you did not receiue it on your knees. And I maruell that you should vse this argument, who say so often, that the customes of Courts are not rules of Theologies.
               
               
                  PP.
                  The sacramental Supper should carry the resemblance of a Supper, in the formes and fashions thereof, or else it cannot rightly be called a Supper: for it is not onely the matter, that is, the dainties and food that makes a banquet, but also the ordering of the guests, and kindly entertainment of them.
               
               
                  ANS.
                  It is true, that it cannot properly be called a Supper, except it carry the resemblance of a Supper, both in the dainties, and in the formes and fashions of a supper; but it may be called a supper rightly, as yee speake, although it doe not resemble a supper in all these things. For that which is properly called a supper, hath plenty and varietie of meat and drinke, at least it is a sufficient bodily repast.

Secondly, at it so much time is spended, as is proportionable to the entertainment. Thirdly, the Guests doe entertaine one another by caruing, and drinking, and other kindly and familiar communication. Fourthly, The time thereof is the euening or night season. I am assured, that the Sacrament, for any resemblance it hath in any of these things to a supper, cannot properly be called a supper, farre lesse in respect of ordering, and entertaining the Guests. For at ordinary suppers, Guests are ordered according to their qualities, but heere there is no respect of persons: for entertainment, Guests are entreated prolixè, that is, largely and long; but heere, more then sparingly, for the bodily part, with a morsell of bread, and a little wine. These being laid aside, what are your table and sitting thereat, but idle spectacles? Yee breake, and giue the bread one to another: that wee haue shewed to be against the Institution; yee drinke one to another, but we ought not to drinke one to another, as the giuer and propiner drinkes to the receiuer: for our Sauiour onely, who is represented by the Pastor, is the giuer and propiner of the Cuppe externally, and of his owne bloud internally; and all the people are but receiuers, not giuers or propiners in any wise. And as to our Communion amongst our selues, it standeth not in this, That wee haue any fellowship in dispensation of the sacred mysteries, but it standeth in the participation alonely: not in this, that we take the bread, breake, and giue it to one another: but in this, that we all receiue the same bread, which is broken by the Pastor, and the same flesh which our Sauiour did breake vpon the Crosse: such like not in that we take the Cup, drinke, and giue it one to another; but in this, that we drinke all of the same Cup, which the Pastor giues after thankesgiuing; and the same bloud which our Sauiour shed for the sinnes of many; otherwise, if wee confound the actions of the Pastor and the people, wee breake and violate the Institution, and disturbe the

whole action, making the people not only act their owne part, but also take vpon them the part of Christ, and the Pastor. We must not therefore seeke the resemblance of the Supper in these things, that are manifestly repugnant to the Institution, but in such things, as are contained therein
                  Go too then, and let vs take a view of these: first, in the Institution a supper is resembled by a sufficient repast, not in the quantity, but in the nature and quality of the elements, the one being drie, the other wette; the one meate, the other drinke, in which two kindes a perfect food consists; to teach vs, that in Christ is all fulnesse: He that comes to me shall neuer hunger, And he that beleeues in me, shall neuer thirst. Secondly, a Supper is resembled in the Sacrament, by the blessing and distribution that is made by the Master of the feast, and by taking, eating and drinking of the Guests, which are the essentiall parts, and properties of a Supper. Thirdly, as a supper is not the repast of some few, but of the whole family and guestes, who are present; for which cause it was called coena tanquam

                     , because it was common: So is the Sacrament instituted for all that are present, who may, and will come and present themselues therto. These are the things set downe in the Institution, wherein the resemblance stands. Your table prerogatiues, gestures, formes, fashions, ordering and entertainment of guestes, we find not, and therefore dare not bee so bold, as to affirme them to be necessary. As in extending the sense of Parables, a moderation would be kept, that it be not racked beyond the bounds and scope of the purpose, whereupon the Parable is inferred: so the parabolicke names giuen to these holy mysteries, should not bee extended beyond the resemblance & similitude set downe in Scripture, for which these names are imposed. Therefore when the Sacrament is called a Table, and a Supper, wee must not thinke that euery thing which is competent to an ordinary table, and

supper, are to be found and obserued there, but only such as haue cleare warrant in the Institution, either in particular, or by necessary consequence. In particular, the whole substantiall things, actions, and ceremonies are expressed, from the which wee should take nothing, and whereunto we should adde nothing. The circumstances that doe necessarily accompany such things, actions, and ceremonies, as the time when, the place where, the part whereon, the person by whom, and to whom, and the order, doe necessarily follow the action: for some time and place must be, when, and where it must be done; some persons by whom, and to whom it must be celebrated; some part there must be, whereon the elements must be set, and from whence they must be giuen and receiued; some position and site of body must be vsed by the giuers, and receiuers, and some order must be obserued for entring and proceeding in the action and finishing therof: some things would go before, as Sermons or Seruice; and it is decent, that the celebration be closed with Psalmes and blessings: but none of these circumstantiall things are particularly defined by Scripture, therefore they are left to bee determined by the Church, according to the rules of edification, order, and decencie.

                  The Sacrament of the Passeouer was also a holy Supper, and the people of God vsed it so; they kneeled not in the act of receiuing it.

                  The Passeouer was an holy Supper, yet it was also coena recta, that is, a full and perfect repast: The Sacrament is a Supper in resemblance onely, as hath beene declared, not instituted 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , for filling of the flesh, but for feeding of the spirit; and therefore is not, to be receiued after a common and carnall manner, but with a spirituall and religious carriage.
                  Lastly, where you say, that when the people receiued

the Law of the Passeouer, they bowed their heads, and worshipped, Exod. 12.17. and they did not so in eating of it: That they were more reuerent in hearing the Law of the Passeouer, then in the participation of it. I answere, They bowed not their head, whilest they did heare, but after they had heard; and this I hope you will not deny: but after the participation of the Passeouer, they gaue thankes with as great reuerence and deuotion, as they vsed after hearing of the Word. Further, at the participation they sate not, but stood all the time, wherin they shew farre greater reuerence, then bowing of the head, which is finished at one instant, could import. And after the first celebration, when the Passeouer was slaine, and sacrificed at the Altar, you cannot say, that the people did not bow: for Micheas testifieth, cap. 6. ver. 6. That when the people brought their oblations, they bowed. As to the eating of it, the same was in priuate houses, and did serue them for an ordinary supper; therfore was it to be receiued accordingly. Our Sacrament is not such, nor hath no such vse, as hath been said; therefore our manner of receiuing ought not to be conformed vnto that, which was vsed at the participation of the Paschal Supper.

                  PP.
                  KNeeling in the act of receiuing the sacramentall elements, is not onely a breach of the Institution in the Gospell, but also of the second Commandement of the Law. The first breach of the Commandement made by kneeling, is the sinne of idolatrie: idolatrie is committed in this act diuers wayes. The Papists kneele in the acte of receiuing, because they beleeue verily that the bread is Transubstantiate into Christs bodie,

and vpon this supposition of Transubstantiation and bodily presence, they kneele: this is the grossest idolatrie that euer was in the world. The Lutheran kneeles vpon his supposition of Consubstantiation, and Christs Reall presence by Consubstantiation: This also is idolatry, and a supposition false. A third sort kneele for reuerence of the elements, not giuing to the elements that high kinde of worship, called commonly cultus Latriae, which the Papists giue, but an inferiour kinde of worship, due (as they thinke) to consecrate creatures: This also is idolatry.

                  It may be obiected, that holy things ought to bee reuerenced. Answer, True, but not worshipped; veneration is one thing, adoration another; adoration belongeth to persons, veneration to things pertaining to persons, and is nothing else, but a religious respect, or reuerent estimation of things pertaining to the vse of Religion; a

preseruation of them, that they be not lost, and a decent vsage of them, according to their kinde: this veneration or reuerence, is a respectiue or relatiue reuerence giuen to them for Gods sake: kneeling for reuerence of senselesse creatures, is to take the proper gesture of relatiue adoration, and apply it to relatiue reuerence: for religious kneeling in all the Scripture, is a gesture of adoration and soueraigne worship, &c.

                  This all is sound, and touching it, wee agree fully with you, that reuerence which is done to the Sacrament should not bee expressed by kneeling, which you truely call a gesture of adoration, and soueraigne worshippe. Therefore should it neither bee giuen to the booke of the Euangell, nor to the elements of the Sacrament, but to him only, who is the Author, and matter of both. And yet if men fall downe, and worship him at the hearing of the Gospell, or after, at the receiuing of the Sacrament, or after, and before it be receiued, being moued thereto by contemplation of his grace, and glory in the one and other: this religious worship no man wil deny to be lawfully performed, as well by the worthy receiuer of the Sacrament, as by the reuerent hearer of the Word; for as we bow not to the letters and syllables, and sounds of the words of the Gospell, but to him, whose minde and will is declared therein: So doe wee not bow to the elements of bread and wine in the Sacrament, but to him, whose body and bloud we receiue thereby. But you, to make the world beleeue, that the Churches of Scotland and England kneele to the elements of bread and wine in the Sacrament, at least haue ordained so to be done: you alledge against the Church of England, the Ministers of Lincolne their defence in the third part thereof, referring the Reader to their proofes; touching which part, I only reply this, that there be sufficient answeres made to these proofes, by learned and reuerend men in that Church,

whereto also I remit the Reader. Against our Church, you lay a false imputation, and frame thereupon all your discourse against kneeling, as it is a breach of the second Commandement, which we will now examine.

                  In the late act, wee are ordained to kneele for reuerence of the diuine mysteries. I see not wherein this differs from the Bishop of Rochesters argument, that great and reuerend dreadfull mysteries, must be receiued with great and dreadfull humilitie of soule, and humiliation of body: therfore in the act of receiuing, we must kneele; if this argument were good, then the Sacraments, and sacrifices of the old Law, should haue been thus worshipped: and if we will measure by the sight, the Sacraments and sacrifices of the old Law, were more dreadfull, then are the Sacraments of the new: for the slaughter of beasts and shedding of blood, was more dreadful, then the powring out of wine. The Ancients held the sight of this Sacrament, not only from Pagans, but also from the Catechumenists: this doing was not commendable, it made the mysterie of this Sacrament both darke and dreadfull. Augustine saith, they may bee honoured as matters religious, but wondered at, as matters of maruell, they cannot. But to returne to the purpose, to kneele for reuerence of the mysteries, is nothing else but to worship the mysteries.

                  Heere you set your selfe against three parties, the Bishop of Rochester, the Ancients, and the Assembly at Perth. For the Bishop of Rochester, I answere shortly, That he takes the mysteries with Chrysostome, for the body and blood of Christ, represented in the Sacrament by the elements of bread and wine. In which sense, they are truly called great and dreadfull, and ought to bee receiued with great humility of soule, and humiliation of body: Non enim peccatur adorando carnem Christi, sed peccatur non

adorando; We sinne not, saith Saint Augustine, in adoring Christs flesh, but we sinne, if wee adore it not in the Sacrament.
                  That which you blame in the Ancients, of withholding the sight of the Sacraments, not only from Pagans, but also frō the Catechumenists, Chrysostome iustifies with great reason, Hom. 7.1. Cor. on these words: We speak the wisdome of God, which is hid. Alia videmus, saith he, alia credimus, aliter afficior ego, aliter infidelis. Infidelis, si lauacrum audiat, aquam simpliciter cogitat, &c. ideo fidei arcana, non sunt temerè apud indignos evulgāda: We see one thing, saith Chrysostom, we beleeue another. I who beleeue am otherwise affected, then an Infidel is: if an Infidel heare of washing in Baptisme, he thinkes there is nothing there but water, &c. For this cause the mysteries of our faith ought not rashly to be divulgate to the vnworthy. This iudgment of Chrysostomes is not crossed by S. Augustines testimony, but confirmed rather: for if the Sacraments should be honoured, as matters religious, then as Chrysostom saith, Pretiosa margarita est à contemptu vindicanda, that is, a pretious jewel ought to be preserued from contempt.
                  Where you alledge against the Assembly at Perth, that in the late act therof, we are ordained to kneele, for reuerence of the diuine mysteries, you are guilty of manifest falshood: for in reciting the words of the act, you blot out some, change others, and thereby corrupt purposely the whole sense and meaning of the act. You blot out these words, of God, and in due regard: you change the word mystery, in mysteries, & these you interpret to be the elements, whereas in the act, the word (mystery) signifies not the elements, but the receiuing of the blessed body and blood of our Lord and Sauiour Iesus Christ. But that your deceit may be manifested, I will set downe the act, as it is extracted forth of the Register of the Assembly, vnder the hand of the Clerke thereof.
                  
                     Since we are commanded by God himselfe, that when we come

to worship him we fall downe, and kneele before the Lord our Maker: and considering withall, that there is no part of diuine worship more heauenly and spirituall, then is the holy receiuing of the blessed body and blood of our Lord and Sauiour Iesus Christ: like as the most humble and reuerent gesture of the body, in our meditation and lifting vp of our hearts, becommeth well so diuine and sacred an action: Therefore notwithstanding, our Church hath vsed since the reformation of Religion heere, to celebrate the holy Communion to the people sitting, by reason of the great abuse vsed in the idolatrous worship of Papists: yet now since all memory of by-past superstition, is blotted out of the hearts of the people praised be God; in reuerence of God, and in due regard of so diuine a mysterie, and in remembrance of so mysticall an vnion, as wee are made partakers of thereby, the Assembly thinkes good, that, that blessed Sacrament bee celebrated hereafter to the people, humbly and reuerently kneeling vpon their knees.
                  
                  This is the true copie of the act, differing in many things from that which you sette downe. Pag. 34. in the narratiue thereof, the reasons are set downe, wherefore the people should kneele, when they receiue the Sacrament, which are repeated orderly in the conclusion, as the causes of the same. The first reason is, Since we are commanded by God himselfe, that when we come to worship him, wee fall downe, and kneele before the Lord our Maker. Relatiue vnto this, we haue in the conclusion, Therefore in reuerence of God, the Assembly thinkes good, that the Sacrament be giuen to the people kneeling. The second reason in the narratiue is, And considering withall, that there is no part of diuine worship more heauenly and spirituall, then is the holy receiuing of the blessed bodie and blood of our Lord and Sauiour Iesus Christ. Relatiue to this, wee haue these words, And in due regard of so diuine a mysterie. Wee say not in regard of the diuine mysteries, which you interpret the elements, but Mysterie, that is, the holy receiuing of the body and blood of Iesus Christ, mentioned in the narratiue. Our third reason is, the correspondence which ought to be

betweene the outward gesture of our body, and the meditation, and lifting vp of our hearts, when we remember and consider the mysticall vnion betweene Christ and vs, and amongst our selues, whereof we are made partakers by receiuing of Christs blessed body and bloud. This is expressed in these words, Like as the most humble and reuerent gesture of the body in our meditation, and lifting vp of our hearts, becomes so diuine and sacred an action. Relatiue to this, in the conclusion, we haue these words; And in remembrance of so mysticall an vnion, as we are made partakers of thereby: for this remembrance is a part of our meditation. So to conclude, we come to worship at the Sacrament the Lord our Maker, who hath not onely made vs by creation, but who by redemption hath made vs his people, and the sheepe of his pasture, Psal. 95.7. Psalme 100.3. that is, God manifested in the flesh▪ We come to receiue his flesh and bloud, and in reuerence of him wee are commanded by the act to kneele. As yee then inferre vpon your forgery and falshood, that to kneele for reuerence of the mysteries is nothing else, but to worship the mysteries: so I inferre vpon the very words wherein the act is conceiued, That to kneele for reuerence of God, in due regard of the diuine mysterie, that is, the receiuing of Christs body and bloud, in remembrance of the mysticall vnion, whereof thereby we are made partakers, first, with our Head and Sauiour; and next, through him, with God, and amongst our selues: to kneele, I say, at the Sacrament for the reuerence and respects aforesayd, is to worship God rightly, and that is the due obseruation of his commandement.

But the publike intent of our Church was neuer to worship the Sacrament, but was, and is, to worship the Lord Iesus, of whose flesh and bloud wee are made partakers in the Sacrament. And they who follow the Church in this, are neither formally nor materially idolaters, but true and sincere worshippers of God.

                  Still you build vpon the false ground you haue layd, that kneeling is direct to the bread and wine in the hands of the Minister, which is a manifest calumny: for the act doth appoint no such thing. To direct our knees to the signes, and the affection of our heart to the thing signified, is not onely idolatry, but a kinde of hypocrisie, and mixture of worship, which God abhorres. Neither did our Church euer allow it in our doctrine, prayers, and exhortations, which are vsed at the Ministration; this is condemned, and the very act ordayning, that we should kneele before the Lord our Maker, forbids the same.

                  This immediate conuoy of worship to the principall obiect, is nothing else, but that finer sort of idolatry, and relatiue worship, which Durandus, Holcot, Mirandula, Alphonsus, Petrus Cluniacensis, and others, giue to their Images.

                  If wee did kneele to the Sacrament, that by it our worship might bee conueyed to God, our kneeling were such a relatiue worship as yee affirme: but we kneele at the Sacrament, and not to the Sacrament, as wee kneele at prayer, and not to the words and oration of the prayer, but to God to whom wee direct our prayer. When God spake, Abraham fell on his face, not to the sound of words, which he heard, but to the Speaker. When the fire came downe at Elias prayer, the people fell on their faces, not to the fire which they saw, but to God, who wrought the myracle. This kneeling and falling on the face before God in the act of prayer, in the act of seeing, in the act of hearing, is a worship done to God immediately; and so it is in the act of receiuing the Sacrament.

                  To make it appeare that there is no difference betweene our kneeling at the Sacrament, and the kneeling of the Papists to their Idols, the Pamphleter (such is his malice) trauels so farre as lyes in him, to extenuate the idolatry of Papists, and to obscure their opinion and doctrine of kneeling to Images, which I will therefore set downe distinctly and shortly out of their owne Writers.
               
            
            
               The Doctrine of Papists, touching the honour of Images.
               THe Papists professe, that they giue to their Images two kindes of honour: The one they call Proper,

the other Accidentall and improper. The proper, they say, is due to the Image, as it is an holy thing, such as the honour which is giuen to the Euangell, to holy Vessels and Vestures; and it is proper, because it rests in the Image, as in the proper obiect, and is not conueyed by the Image immediately to the principall and archetype, albeit it be giuen to the Image, for the respect and reuerence which is carryed to the principall, and so by consequence redounds to the principall. This honour they affirme to differ, not in specie, but in degree onely from the honor which is properly due to the principall. Bellar. lib. 2. de Imag. cap. 21. & 25.
               Before wee proceede to the improper and accidentall adoration of Images, we haue here to consider, that albeit no honour, but contempt, and destruction onely be due to Papisticall Images, because they are not holy things, but detestable abominations: yet therefore we must not thinke, that to such things as are truely holy, and applyed to religious vses, reuerent and religious respect is not due, as to the holy Sacraments, and to the Euangell, which honor rests in them, and is giuen to them in respect of him, whose word and Sacraments they are, and so redounds to him consequently: such an honour I meane as is the hearing of the Word reuerently, and the handling of the Sacraments, with the preseruing, and vsing of them decently. It is true, this honour is not properly a spece of adoration, but a religious reuerence onely, which we must not reiect, because the Papists giue the same, or the like, to their Idols: for they giue to things which are not religious, but superstitious, and execrable, a religious honour: therefore this reason is a meere deception, wherwith ye abuse the simple. Papists giue such honor to their Idols, and in so doing they commit idolatry: therefore sincere Professors in giuing that honor to the Sacraments & the word, commit idolatry. It followes not, for Papists giue the honor which is due to the Word

and Sacraments vnto their Idols, to which it no wise belongs: as by example; Papists vse their Images for signes, meanes, and occasions to stirre them vp to worshippe God, and in this they commit idolatry, because they reuerence, vse, and handle them as holy things, which God hath not allowed to be done: but when a true Christian vseth the Word of God, and the Sacraments for signes, middesse, occasions, and instruments to stirre him vp to worship God, and in that respect honours and reuerences them as holy things, hee doth not commit idolatry, nor breakes not the second Commandement: but by the contrary he obserues that Commandement, in vsing the meanes, which God himselfe hath ordayned to be vsed in his worship: and hee obserues the third Commandement, which bindes all men to sanctifie the Name of God, and such meanes as he hath vouchsafed to manifest himselfe by to vs in his worship.
               Now I proceede to the accidentall and improper honour, which Papists professe themselues to giue to their Images. This is the point here most controuerted, and therefore most expedient to be knowne.
               The accidentall honour which they giue to their Images is, an adoration of their Images coniunctly with the principall; as when the King is honoured, his Robe Royall, and all his Ornaments are honoured coniunctly with his person, and with the same signes of honour that are giuen to his person: Bellarm. ibidem cap 20. & 23.
               The improper honour is the adoration of the Image in place, and stead of the principall: as, when the Prince his Ambassadour is honored for the Prince himselfe; or, an empty Coffin or Image, for the person himselfe, whose Image it is; all the honour due to the Prince, is done in that case to the Ambassadour or Image; as beckning, kneeling, discouering of the head, prostration of the body, kiss
                     •
                  ng, enbracing, and burning of Incense, &c. Bellarm. ibidem.
               
               
                  The improper, and accidentall honour, or adoration, differs from the proper: first, because the proper, as they say, although it be the same in specie, with that which is giuen to the principall, yet it differs from it in degree; but this improper honour is the same, both in specie and in degree. Next, because the proper, as they say, terminatur, that is, ends and rests in the Image, and redounds not immediately to the principall, but by way of consequence. The improper, and accidentall adoration, although it be done to the Image, non tamen terminatur, yet it ends not, and rests in the Image, but passes, and is immediately conueyed to the principall by the Image, and from the Image. Bellarm. ibid. cap. 21. & 25.
               This is summarily their doctrine, as may bee seene in their Writings. To apply this to our purpose, yee labour to extenuate this adoration, which they professe themselues to giue vnto their Images accidentally and improperly, saying, that the externall signes of adoration, such as kneeling, bowing, discouering of the head, &c. are onely done before them, and about them. This is too sparingly and rashly spoken: for these externall shewes are not onely done before and about them, but the externall adoration is wholy exhibited to them. Bellarmine lib. 2. de Imag. cap. 23. writeth thus: Aliquando imago sumitur pro ipso exemplari, & ea quae fierent circae ipsum exemplar

That is to say; The Image sometimes is taken for the exemplar it selfe, and these things which would be done about the exemplar it selfe, if it were present, are done vnto the Image, or about the Image, the minde being alwaies fixed vpon the exemplar. So Preachers direct their speech to the Image of the Crucifiex, and say vnto it, Thou redeemedst vs, thou reconciledst vs to the Father. And a little after▪ in the same place he saith; Aliquando

In the 25. Session of the Councell of Trent, De inuocatione, & sacris imaginibus, it is enacted as followeth: Imagines porro Christi, Deiparae Virginis, & aliorum Sanctorum in templis praesertim habendas & retinendas, eis

That is to say; The Councell, moreouer, ordaines, that the Images of Christ, of the Virgin Mary, and of other Saints, should bee kept and retayned chiefely in Churches, and due honour & veneration giuen to them: not because we beleeue, that there is in them any diuinitie or vertue, for the which they ought to bee worshipped, but because the honour which is giuen to them, is referred to the exemplar, which they represent; so as by the Images which we kisse, and before the which we discouer our heads, and fall downe, we adore Christ. Hence it is manifest, that the signes of honour, which are done before them, and about them, are exhibited to them they kisse them, they speake to them, they kneele, they fall downe, they discouer their heads to them, and all is done about them, that would be done about Christ; all is

done to them, that would bee done to Christ, as if hee were present in person. This is the professed and auouched doctrine of the Papists, which yee, as a deceiuer, go about to extenutae. So, to conclude this point, that by the act at Perth we are ordained to bow our knees to the Elements of bread and wine in the Sacrament, or that any such honour, or signe of adoration is done to the Sacrament by vs, as Papists grant they giue to their Images, is a most impudent lye.

The worship

proceeding from such occasions and motiues (as the bowing of our knees at the Sacrament to Christ, occasioned by the vse and signification, which the sacramentall Elements haue in that action) differs as much from the relatiue worship, which Durandus, and the rest giue to their Idols, as the sincere and right worship of God differs from detestable idolatry.

                     , As on Good-friday, when the Image of Christ crucified is a little discouered and shewed, & proponed to bee adored, all these things are vnderstood to bee exhibited to Christ per imaginem, by the Image; he saith not, coram and circum, before, & about the Image, but per, that is, by the Image: and a little after, in the same Chapter, Aliquando consideramus exemplar, vt obiectiuè relucet in imagine, &c. that is, We sometimes consider the exemplar, as set before our eyes in the Image, & we adore it, as clothed with the Image. Here he saith, the principall is adored in the Image, as the King in his royall Roabe: this is the coniunct adoration, when the principall is adored in the Image, & the Image with the principall coniunctly. The place which I cited out of the Councel of Trent, saith, Per imaginē Christū adoramus, that is, We worship Christ by the Image. Bellar. cap. 21.26. describes the improper adoration in these words;

                     Si imago nō est adoranda nisi improprie, quia nimirū corā illa vel in illa, vel per illā adoratur exemplar, &c. that is, If an Image should not be adored but improperly, to wit, because before it, or in it, or by it, the exemplar is adored. And Cap. 20. about the end, Fiunt erga statuā omnia, quae circa corpus fierent. that is, All things are done to the Image, which would haue beene done to the body. So these words, per. in, circa, erga, are vsed by Bellarmine, and the Papisticall Doctors, as corā, & circū. This was to be declared, because afterwards yee alledge, that we kneele before the Sacrament: & to make it appeare, that we match the Papists in their idolatry, ye would haue the Reader beleeue, that the Papists do no more but kneele before their Images; and that they doe not worship God, or our Sauiour Iesus Christ in, and by their Images.

                     Suarez saith, that the Image is neither the formall, nor the materiall, the totall, nor the partiall obiect of adoration in their opinion: but that onely at the presence of the Images the principall called to remembrance by the Image, is adored; that the Image is an occasion, a middesse, a signe, stirring vp a man to adore the principall. Their adoration then was also abstract from the obiect, as they pretend theirs to be.

                  The Papists alledge, yet falsely, that the Image is no waies the obiect of their internal adoration, but the principal only, wherupon their minds are fixed. Yet all of thē in one voice, & the Councell of Trent confesse, that they exhibite to the Images all the externall reuerence & adoration which is due to the principall; and that they adore the Image, either in liew of Christ, or coniunctly wi

                     h him, as the robe and vesture wherein hee is clothed, and shines. Their externall adoration therfore is not abstract from their Images, but our externall and internall both are abstract. For we are no more enioyned by the act to bow our knee to the sacramentall Elements,

then to fixe our minds vpon them, & worship them in our hearts. Also, when Suarez calleth the Image an occasion, a middesse, a signe, stirring vp a man to adore the principall, he neither saies, nor meanes, that the Image should not be adored externally with that same worship which is due to the principal. To be short, The Papists make their Images obiects of adoration both actiuely & passiuely: actiuely, because they call men to remembrance of the principall, & as signes, middesse, & occasions, they stir vp mē to worship. Passiuely, because the same external worship, whereunto men are stirred vp by the Image, is first exhibited to the Image, & by it conueied to the principal. So whatsoeuer vse the Image hath besides, in their opinion, it is manifest by their doctrine, that it is externally to be adored with the same worship that is due to Christ.

                     e him, except by the contemplation of the creatures, the meditation of the Word, and the consideration

of the holy Sacraments: take these occasions, middesse, and signes away, yee abolish Religion, and all the worship of God out of the Word. I hope the Reader by this shall see the difference to bee as great in this case, as is betweene a lawfull meane of Gods worship, commanded by himselfe, and the inuention of man prohibited by God.
                  Next, the Papists will haue these middesse, occasions, & signes not onely obiects of diuine worship actiue, that is, seruing to stir vp, and moue men to worship, which is the first degree of their idolatry: but they will haue them likewise passiue obiects, such as are to be worshipped either in stead of the principall, or coniunctly with him; & this is a higher degree of idolatry. In this then they differ also from the Word, Sacraments, & creatures, that these being the ordinary obiects & instruments whereby men must be stirred vp to worship God, & so the obiects of diuine adoration actiuely, they neither are, nor should they be esteemed passiue obiects of adoration, that is, such as should be adored, either coniunctly with God, or in his stead. This we condemne & detest, yet must not run on with you to the other extremity, & say, that howsoeuer they were ordained of God to be signes & seales of his graces, yet they are not in statu accōmodato ad adorādū
                     : for although by them, & before thē, that is, (to make the obcurities which ye affect, plaine) albeit they should neither be adored in place of God & his Son, or coniunctly wi

                     h God & his Son, as the Papists professe to adore their Images▪ yet certaine it is, that there is nothing in nature, or religion fit & apt to stirre men vp to worship God, if the Sacraments be not meet. Shall our corporall food, when it is presented on table before vs, bee in such state, as is proper to stir vs vp to worship God with thanksgiuing & praier? Shall the consideration of the benefit which we haue by the light of the day, & by our rest & sleepe in the night, be esteemed motiues of such moment, that he who

is not thereby moued in the morning when he riseth, and at night when he goeth to bed, to pray, and giue thanks, is esteemed a slothfull and ingratefull Christian? Shall a seasonable seede time, shall the first and latter raine, and a faire haruest bee pregnant occasions to remember vs both in priuate and publike to giue thanks, and praise God for his goodnesse? And shall the blessed Sacrament of the body and bloud of Iesus Christ, in the very act, when it is in giuing and receiuing, not be esteemed to be in proper state to moue vs, and stirre vp our hearts to pray, and giue thanks for that inestimable benefite, euen when our Sauiour hath cōmanded that we should do this in remembrance of him? It is an absurd opinion. Then to conclude; If yee hold these two points which ye haue propounded, to wit, that the Sacrament, and creatures of God should not be vsed as occasions, middesses, and signes to moue vs by the sight and meditation of them, to lift vp our hearts to the spirituall obiect of our faith, that is, to God in Iesus Christ, because Suarez saith, that their Images haue that vse; then certainely, you must hold, that God should not bee knowne nor worshipped in the World: for without this vse of the Word, Sacraments, and Creatures, God cannot bee knowne, nor worshipped. So whilst yee flye idolatry, yee fall into Atheisme. Next, if yee hold, that the Sacraments in the very act of the administration, are not in statu accommodato ad adorandum, you must take away the chiefe and principall ende of the Sacrament commended to vs by the Lord himselfe in these words, Doe this in remembrance of me. Saint Paul interprets these words thus; So often as yee eate this bread, and drinke of this Cuppe, yee shall declare the Lords death, till he come againe: that is, as the Confession of our faith, which yee haue sworne and subscribed, explaines it, Yee shall extoll, magnifie, and prayse his death. Now this is a reall act of adoration, which both the Lord himselfe, and his holy Apostle would haue vs moued vnto

by this Sacrament. So by these your positions and assertions, yee mutilate the Sacrament of one of the most principall ends, for the which it was instituted. And generally yee take from the Creatures of God, and the holy Sacraments, the most excellent vse, for which they were appointed: namely, to be meanes and motiues to stirre vs vp vnto the worship of our Creator and Redeemer.

                  If this kinde of relatiue worship were to be allowed, then the holy signes both in the olde and new Testament should haue serued to the same vse; then they who are farre distant from the Table should kneele: for the Elements are to them obiectum à quo significatiuè: then at the sight of the Sunne, or any beautifull Creature we should kneele, seeing they put vs in minde of Gods incomprehensible beautie: and seeing many of them allow the historicall vse of Images, we may fall downe before the Crucifixe, prouiding, the action of the minde be abstracted from the Image.

                  We allow no worship, whether it be relatiue, or absolute, that is either giuen to Sacrament or Creature. But it is a grosse error to thinke that the worship which is onely giuen to God immediately, or directly, is relatiue, because it is motioned, and occasioned by the consideration of Gods Creatures, and blessed Sacraments: for so all the worship of God must be relatiue, because it is all occasioned either by the Word, the Sacraments, or the Creatures: whereas, indeede, there is no worship relatiue, but that which is giuen to some mediate thing, for the relation it hath to the principall: and as for vs, wee neyther giue to the Word, the Sacrament, or any Creature, diuine worship, but onely to God, whom by the Word, the Sacrament, and the Creatures wee are taught and admonished to worship. The relatiue worship

is onely that which Papists giue to their Idols, for the relation they haue to the principall, which we detest, and condemne as much as your selfe.
                  Where you say, that the signes of the olde and new Testament, and the sacramentall Elements, when they are onely seene, as likewise the Sunne, or any beautifull creature, might then moue vs to adore: I answere, that although they be potentially obiectū à quo, obiects whereby we may bee stirred vp to worship; yet are they not actually such, except they bee applyed, and accommodate to that vse, either in the ordinary publique ministerie, or in a mans priuate meditation and deuotion: or extraordinarily vpon some present and great occasion; as when the fire came downe at the prayer of Elias, and consumed the sacrifice. When the Signes, Sacraments, or Works of God, are after that manner propounded and insinuated, they are in statu accommodato ad orandum, and then men ought to adore and worship God: yet it is not necessary that they should, vpon all such occasions, fall downe and kneele, as yee conclude: For when in our priuate meditation and deuotion, or when by some present great occasion, wee are inwardly moued and affected to worship; our externall gesture of adoration is arbitrarie, and left to our owne priuate election, to doe what is most conuenient & decent for that time: Sometime the discouering of the head is sufficient, sometime the lifting vp of the eyes onely, and sometime no gesture at all is required; but in the ordinary Ministerie, when the works of God, or his benefites are propounded, and applyed publikely, to stirre vs vp to worship in the assemblies of the Church, then our gesture ceaseth to bee arbitrarie: for it must be such as is prescribed and receiued in the Church, where we worship. So, when by the sight of the Sacraments onely, or by the sight of holy signes, or creatures of God, wee are moued priuately to worshippe, wee may vse, or not vse, what gesture

we thinke meetest; yet when we come to the table our selues, not to be spectators, but to communicate with others, we oug

                     t to receiue, and worship after the forme and custome of that Church in which we are. If they sit with their heads discouered, so should we: If they stand or passe by, so should we: If they kneele, so should wee for vniformity and peace sake. Saint Augustine in his 118. Epist. Ad quam fortè ecclesiam veneris, eius morem serua, si cuiquam non vis esse scandalo, nec quenquam tibi: that is, Keepe the custome of the Church whereunto thou comest, if thou would be offensiue to no man, and wouldst haue no man offensiue to thee: This Saint Augustine learned of Saint Ambrose, and as he saith, hee did neuer thinke of it, but he esteemed it as an oracle, that he had receiued from heauen. As to those in the Reformed Churches, who allow the historicall vse of Images, they condemne with vs, both the externall and internall adoration of Images: Therefore, by their doctrine, wee may not kneele before the Crucifixe, because it is a sort of externall adoration.
               
               
                  PP.
                  All the parts of Gods worship ought to be direct, and not oblique. Perkins saith, It is idolatry to turne, dispose, or direct the worship of God, or any part thereof, to any particular place, or creature, without the appointment of God; and more specially, to direct our adoration to the bread, or to the place where the bread is, what is it lesse then idolatrie?

                  If by the Act of Perth, wee had beene ordained to kneele to the Sacrament, either in stead of Christ, or coniunctly with him, you might call it an oblique worship that were enioyned; but seeing we are commanded, in receiuing the holy Sacramēt, to bow our knees to God only, and to nothing with him, or in his stead; our worship is direct, and not oblique: Therefore wee subscribe to the

iudgement of Perkins. But I must tell you, that hitherto your disputation hath not only been oblique, but impertinent, for your haue impugned nothing set downe in the Act; only you haue set your selfe against a position forged by your selfe, in falsifying the Act. Thus while you haue intended that you shall neuer be able to performe, namely, to proue, that by kneeling at the Sacrament, a breach is made of the second Commandement, you haue made a manifest breach of your credit and honesty.
               
               
                  PP.
                  Kneeling before the Elements, referred directly to Christ, is either a gesture signifying the humble submission of the minde in generall, whereby wee make obeysance, as if hee were bodily present: or else it signifieth more particularly our humiliation in prayer: This is but a speciall, the former was a generall; the like reasons serue against both. It is true, wee cannot kneele to God in prayer, but there are many things before vs, a Church, a house, a wall, a tree, a staire, &c. But wee set them not before vs purposely, wee are by no direction tyed vnto them; they stand only before vs by casuall position, neyther can we choose otherwise to doe.
               
               
                  ANS.
                  Your former dispute was founded on falsehood, this runnes all vpon ambiguity of speech. To kneele before the Elements hath two senses, either it signifies to kneele to the Elements, as wee are said to kneele before God, when we kneele vnto him; and Papists before their Images, when they kneele to them. In this sense, it is a lye to affirme, that we kneele before the Elements. Next, to kneele before any thing, signifieth to kneele, hauing some things before our eyes, or in our sight, or obiect to our senses either by casuall position, as you say, or purposely. To kneele to God before any thing, standing, or set casually before you, you doe not condemne; but to kneele to God, hauing any thing purposely before vs, as the sacramentall

Elements, that yee insinuate to be idolatrie, but I hope you shal neuer proue it: for a Penitentiary kneeles to God purposely before the Congregation, and with a respect to the Congregation; namely, that they may concurre with him in prayer, he may testifie to them his vnfained repentance, and they being satisfied therewith, may receiue him againe into their fellowship. Heere is a kneeling to God before something purposely, and with respect, which is not idolatrie. When wee come to our common tables, before we eate, either sitting with our heads discouered, or standing, or kneeling, we giue thanks and blesse with a respect to the meat, which is purposely set on table; yet this is not idolatry. And to draw somewhat nearer to the purpose: The Pastor, when he begins the holy action, hath the bread and the cup set before him purposely vpon the table, and with respect to them hee giues thankes to God, for that it hath pleased him to institute the Sacrament in these Elements, that hee might thereby communicate to vs, the body and the blood of Iesus. And thus hee ought to blesse the Elements, for which the Apostle saith, The Cup of his blessing which wee blesse, is it not the Communion of the blood of Christ? Heere is a praying, a blessing, a thankesgiuing to God before the Elements, purposely set before vs, and not by casuall position: And it is true, that if any may bee said to kneele before the Elements, it is the Pastor in this part of the action, and not the people. For when they receiue, they do not set the bread before them, as Papists doe the Crucifix, but presently they put it in their mouthes, and whilest they are eating, they continue still kneeling, not before the bread, which is not then before them, but before the Lord Iesus, vnto whom they only kneele. In all this the Pastor doth imitate our Sauiour himselfe, who first tooke the bread, and hauing it purposely before him, or holding it in his hands, Gaue thankes, and after Supper tooke the Cup, which he did blesse also. So to kneele or adore God

before the Elements, that is, hauing them in our sight, or obiect to our senses, as ordinary signes, means, & memorials to stirre vs vp to worship God and our Sauiour, directly, immediatly, & onely, and not the Elements, either in his stead, or coniunctly with him; is no idolatry, but the right and true forme of Gods worship.
                  The cause of all this errour is, you make no distinction betweene the abuse of Idols in the worship of God, and the right vse of his workes, Word, and Sacraments. To pray, or giue thankes to God before an Image, with respect to it, is idolatry: but to pray and giue thankes to God, hauing his creatures, or Sacraments before our eyes and mindes, and being mooued by the respects that we consider in them, is a most lawfull and religious forme of adoration. For we can neither pray to God▪ nor thank him, nor praise him, but euer there must bee, before the eyes of our minds at least, something of his works, Word, or Sacraments, if not before our externall senses; and that we must respect, consider, and be mooued thereby. Contrariwise, to set before the eyes of our minds or bodie, any Image, as a meane or motiue of adoration, is idolatrie. For although the worship were abstracted, which is occasioned by the Image, and were not giuen vnto it (as neuer any hath said, except your selfe, of the externall adoration) yet it is damned, because no true worship can be properly occasioned by an Image, which is a Doctor of lyes, teaching nothing of God, but falsehood and vanities. But the blessed Sacrament being instituted by Christ, to call to our remembrance his death, and the benefit we haue thereby, giues vs so oft as we receiue it, a most powerfull and pregnant occasion of thankesgiuing and praise; which if wee should neglect, and not adore, we should bee guilty of the breach of the first Commandement, because we did not adore, when Christ purposely did offer the greatest occasion, that can be presented so to doe. Therefore, when by that occasion,

we adore our Sauiour, both on the knees of our soule and body, we are no breakers, but due obseruers, as well of the first, as second Commandement.

                  It is true likewise, that God directed his people vnder the Law, to bend and bow themselues towards the Arke, and the Temple wherein the Arke was, and the mountaine whereon the Temple was situate: partly, lest that rude people should turne their worshippe another way; partly because of his promise to heare them, when they should pray towards the Temple, or Arke; partly because of his singular manner of presence in the Arke. He was said to dwell betweene the Cherubins, the Arke is called his foot-stoole, and sometimes the face of God, the glory of God: It is reason, where God is present after an extraordinary manner, as when he spake out of the bush, and the cloud, that adoration be directed to the place of his extraordinary presence: The Altars, the offrings, and other holy things, wanted the like presence and promise,: The Arke, and the Cherubins vpon the Arke were not seene, therefore could not be readily abused to idolatry.

                  You make heere an exception, and confesse, that it was lawfull to kneele before the Temple, the Arke, and Gods holy Mountaine, because of Gods direction, promise and presence. Likewise yee acknowledge that adoration may bee directed to the place of extraordinarie presence. And hereby it is manifest, that to worship God before a creature, or before the testimonies of his presence, although we haue these things before vs purposely and not occasionally onely, doth not import a communion of his worship with the creatures, or meanes, before the which men may worship: for it is certaine, that if the people vnder the Law, by bending, as you say, and bowing of themselues towards the Temple, Mountaine,

and Arke, had communicated any part of Gods worship with the Temple, Mountaine, and Arke, as the Papists doe with their Idols, their worship had beene idolatry, and a breach of the second Commandement, which God would neuer haue appointed, for whatsoeuer respect, eyther of his ordinary, or extraordinary presence. Where yee say, That the Altars, and Offerings and other holy things, wanted the like presence, & that before these, they might not bow in that respect, it is vtterly false: For Salomon first stood, and after kneeled before the Altar, and prayed, 2. Chron. 6.12. And hee stood before the Altar of the Lord in presence of all the Congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands, For SALOMON had made a brasen scaffold of fiue cubits long, and fiue cubits broad, and three cubits high, and set it in the middest of the court, and vpon it hee stood, and he kneeled downe vpon his knees before all the Congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands towards heauen, and said, &c. Likewise it is manifest by the Prophet Micha. 6.6. That the people bowed when they offered their Oblation: Wherewith shall I come before the Lord, and bow my selfe before the most high God? Heere we haue Salomon kneeling before the Altar, and the people kneeling, when they offered their oblations. Where you say, that the Arke and Cherubins were not seene, towards which they bowed, 
                        〈◊〉
                      makes nothing for your purpose, for the Temple was seene, and the Mountaine was seene, towards the which they also bowed: So was the Altar and the Oblations. Therefore this is but a dreame, that you haue fancied to your selfe, to say, it is idolatry to bow our knees to God before his creatures, or holy mysteries, if so we vse them only as meanes, and instruments, and memorials, to stirre vs vp to worship God.

                  If yee doe maintaine this, it is an absurde heresie; for the holy Sacrament hath farre more euidence, and excellent promises, presence and command, then any type vnder the Law. Our Sauiour before his Ascension, when he commanded his Apostles to teach and baptise, promised, that whilest they taught his people that which hee commanded them, He would be with them to the end of the world. Amongst the obseruations which hee commanded them to teach, this is one of the first and principall, Doe this in remembrance of mee. Is not Christ present then with Pastor and people, according to his promise, in this holy action? And in another place, he saith, Where two or three are mette together in my name, there am I in the middest of them. Where so many Communicants are met together, is not our Sauiour in the middest of them? Further, when he saith of the bread, This is my Body, and of the Cup, This is my Blood: doth it not import a coniunction betweene his Body and the Elements, and a spirituall presence of his Body in the Sacrament? And should not his body and blood be as present to the eyes of thy minde, thy knowledge and vnderstanding, and to the hand of thy heart, thy faith and confidence, as are the Elements to thy externall senses, and bodily hand? Haue we not taught our people to this day, and yet should teach them, that in this action, there is an internall and externall receiuer, the hand and the heart: that there is an earthly and spiritual gift, the Elements of the Sacrament, and the body and blood of Christ? And should we not beleeue, that Christ, God, and Man, is as really present in the Sacrament, according to his Diuinity, as we beleeue him to bee bodily present in heauen, giuing and applying the selfe-same bodie which is in heauen, as really to the inward man, as the Pastor is giuing the Elements to the outward? How dare you then affirme, that the Sacrament hath not such a presence of Chrst, as the Arke, the Propitiatory, and the

Cherubins had. O but he said, that he would dwell betweene the Cherubins; That dwelling was typicall, but Christ hath promised to dwel spiritually and really in the hearts of the worthy receiuers. The bread which we breake, is it not the communion of the body of Christ? The cup which we blesse, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? And saith he not of this communion? Hee that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, remaineth in me, and I in him. God called the Arke his foot-stoole, but Christ calleth the sacramentall Elements, his body and blood. Sometime hee called the Arke his face, and glory, because it was a type of his face and glory; but the Sacrament is not a bare type, but a powerfull instrument, whereby Christ is communicate vnto vs, that wee may bee made partakers heere of his grace, and hereafter of his glory. Finally, when we are commanded to doe this in remembrance of him, we are commanded to adore him; for according to the interpretation, made in the Confession of Faith, confirmed by act of Parliament, which yee professe your selfe to haue sworne, To doe this in remembrance of Christ, is to magnifie, declare, extoll, and praise his death till his comming againe. And this is a reall act of adoration.

                  That is true, yet worship stands in certaine actions, which must bee performed in some conuenient place, as Prayers, Supplications, Intercessions, Thankesging and Praises; whersoeuer these actions are performed, in these places God must bee worshipped: and if the blessed Sacrament bee an action of that kinde, in it God must bee worshipped, and in the place where it is celebrated.

                  Adoration is tyed in the new Testament to the Manhood of Christ, the true Arke, and Propitiatory; and is

carried to that place, in which wee certainly know the said Manhood to exist substantially, saith Perkins; and therefore it is, that wee lift vp our eyes to the heauens, where hee is, and direct our very externall worship to him.
               
               
                  ANS.
                  We doe fully agree with Perkins in all this, for wee neither direct our internall, nor externall adoration to the sacramentall Elements, nor to the place where they are, but to the Manhood of Iesus, which wee acknowledge, and beleeue to be locally only in heauen. Therfore in the ancient Church, when the people came to the Sacrament, the Deacon cried, Sursum corda, Lift vp your hearts, and the people answered, Habemus ad Dominum. Wee haue our hearts lifted vp to the Lord. But what is this to the purpose in hand? For the question is not, in whom God should bee worshipped, or in what place Christs Manhood is, wherin God should be worshipped; but the question is, whether at the Sacrament in the act of receiuing the sacramentall Elements externally, and the body and blood of Iesus Christ, internally; we may bow our knees, and lift vp our hearts, and adore that Manhood, by reason of the personall vnion, that it hath with the Godhead, and the Godhead dwelling in the Manhood corporally. This is the only true relatiue worship acceptable to God, in the Humanitie to worship the Diuinitie, and the Humanitie with the Diuinitie in one Person, the inuisible God in his owne essentiall and incarnate Image, the Lord Iesus: That such worship may, and should bee performed in receiuing the blessed Sacrament, neuer any Diuine, ancient or moderne, hath doubted to this day, except Anabaptists and Arrians, who deny Christs Diuinity, and will neither adore him in the Sacrament, nor any other action of Diuine worship.

But if he had remembred the Lords owne saying, Ier. 15.

But the Bishops opinion is not so absurde, as you would haue men to thinke: for by standing, in the Scripture any diuine seruice is signified. Therefore the Lords Prophets, Priests, and Angels, are said to stand before him, that is, to serue him. In the first of the Kings 8.22. it is written, that Salomon stood before the Altar of the Lord, and prayed, but in the second of the Chronicles 6.13. It is said he kneeled downe, and prayed vpon his knees. So standing, in the booke of the Kings, is taken for kneeling. But leauing this, I come to your next words.

                  This is a needlesse distinction, for the mentall prayer of the Receiuer should not bee different from the prayer

vttered by the Minister at the deliuery of the Elements, and ought only to bee an Amen to the Ministers prayer. The ancient custome of the Church was such; for in the dayes of Cornelius Bishop of Rome, anno 251. as Eusebius records, l. 2. c. 32. when Nouatus gaue the Sacramēt to his people, he held their hāds, & insteed of the blessing which he should haue vsed at the deliuery of the Elemēts, he cō
                     ceiued an oath, & made the people sweare by that which was in their hands, & insteed of Amen, which they should haue answered the blessing with, he made the people say, That they should not returne to CORNELIVS. Whereby it is manifest, that the blessing vsed by the Pastor at the deliuery of the Elements, differed not at that time from the mentall prayer of the Communicant, neither ought it now to differ, but be the same in substance.

                  As for the prayer of the Minister in the act of distribution, it is flat against the Institution, as I haue already said. The Minister is ordained by the Institution, to act the person of Christ, and pronounce the words of promise; This is my body, and not change the promise into a prayer. Fenner in his Principles of Religion, layeth this downe for a ground, that in the second Commandement we are forbidden the practise and vse of any other rite, or outward means vsed in the worship or seruice of God, then he hath ordained, Ioh. 4.22. 2. King. 18.4. And that by the contrary, we are commanded to practise all these parts of his worship, which hee in his word hath commanded, and to acknowledge only the proper vse of euery rite, and outward meanes, which the Lord hath ordained, Deut. 12.32. 2. King. 17.26.

                  It is false that yee say, we change the promise into a prayer: for at the Consecration wee obserue precisely the words of the Institution. In the deliuery of the elements,

we vse a prayer that is not contrary, but most agreeable to the Institution, for directing the hearts of the people in the receiuing, that they may worthily communicate. So doe the Pastors in France at the deliuery vse a short speech: and it was the custome of late in our Church, to vse some exhortations before the distribution at euery Table; wherein neither we nor they did, or doe practise any rite, or vse any means, which God hath not ordained to bee vsed in his worship.
For although the particular forme of speech vsed in the French Church, and the exhortations and prayers vsed by vs, bee not expressely set downe; yet being agreeable to the Word, and the nature of the action in hand, they haue sufficient warrant by these generall precepts: Let all things be done to edification; Let all things bee done decently and in order.
And with these precepts Fenners grounds doe agree: Otherwise, by what warrant is it appointed in the forme set downe before our Psalme bookes, touching the celebration of the Lords Supper, that during the time of the distribution, some place of Scripture should bee read, which doth liuely set forth the death of Christ; to the intent, that our eyes and senses may not onely be occupied in these outward signes of bread and wine, which are called the visible word, but that our minds and hearts also, may be fully fixed in the contemplation of the Lords death, which is by this holy Sacrament represented. This ordinance is not contained in the Institution: yet I hope yee will not say, that it is flat contrary thereto, but that it hath sufficient warrant by the generall Apostolike precepts before expressed: and so hath the prayer vsed by vs in the acte of distribution. But yee subioyne another reason to prooue the prayer vsed at this time vnlawfull.

In the late Canon it is said, That the most reuerend and humble gesture of the body, in our meditation and lifting vp of our hearts, best becommeth so diuine an action. Meditation is no prayer, and the heart may be lifted vp by the act of faith and contemplation, aswell as the action of prayer. So that neither publike nor mentall prayer is expressed in our Act.

                  Albeit neither mentall nor publike prayer be expressed in the Act, yet prayer, thankesgiuing, and praise, are all insinuated: for albeit all meditation bee not prayer, yet euery prayer is a meditation: and although in the act of faith and contemplation, the heart may bee lifted vp; yet, that eleuation of the heart requireth not the most humble, and reuerent gesture of the bodie, as

kneeling. In the ancient Church, they were not accustomed to kneele, when they made confession of their faith, but to stand as Christian souldiers. Our act insinuateth such a meditation, and lifting vp of the heart, as is vsed in actions of deuotion, such as prayer and thankesgiuing; which are practised by all, who giue obedience to the act, or doe worthily communicate. But, put the case, that by the act, no such thing were ordained expresly, yet vpon this antecedent which yee vse; namely, wee are not ordained by any act of our Church, to pray at the receiuing; this conclusion will not follow: Therefore we may not p

                  The meditation vpon the analogie betweene the signe, and the thing signified, cannot be the principall worke of the soule, it being nothing else, but the consideration of the similitude, that is betweene the natuall vse of the signes, and the spirituall vse of the thing signified: Namely, that as the Elements se
                        •
                     ue to nourish the outward man: so the body and the bloud of Christ, hath a vertue to nourish the inward man, and by eating and drinking, the Elements are applied to feede the body: So by faith, the body and the blood of Christ are applied to feed the

soule. Such a meditation, an Hypocrite and Reprobate may haue at the Table, therefore it cannot be the principall worke of the minde, which distinguisheth the worthie, from the vnworthie Receiuer. When we heare and reade the Word, the principall work of our mind, should not be a meditation vpon the forme of the characters, the sound of the letters, the coniunction of them, their sounds in the syllables, the syllables in the words, or the force and vertue of the words to signifie the matters; but the chiefe work of our mind should be to conceiue, vnderstand, and consider rightly what is spoken. So when we come to the Sacrament, the chiefe employment of our minde, should not be to consider the proportion that is betweene the naturall vse of the Elements, and the spirituall vse of Christs body and blood, but a meditation and spirituall action correspondent, and analogicke to the externall sacramentall actions. As therefore the principall externall sacramental actions, are to take, eate and drink reuerently the symbolick Elements, the bread and wine; so the principall worke of the soule, correspondent by analogie thereto, is to remember the sacrifice of Christ, the breaking of his body, and shedding of his blood: to consider the benefit that we haue thereby, to put our confidence therein; and for all, to praise and magnifie his name with thankfulnesse. This worke and meditation, is proper to the worthy Receiuers, and stirreth vp in the soule, that most reuerent estimation and affection towards our Sauiour, with an humble submission of our minds vnto him, which we call adoration: whereof the outward testimonie and signe, is the humble and reuerent gesture of the body, prescribed in the act, which is also a gesture most conuenient for prayer. So this gesture prescribed in the act, doth not only attend the prayer vttered by the Pastor, and conceiued by the people in the act of receiuing, but is proper to that, which is indeed the chiefe and principal exercise & work of the mind, in al worthy receiuers.

These short eiaculations of the minde, are onely occasionall, as a Christian feeleth his owne present estate; and are incident to all our actions, both ciuill and religious: in the act of receiuing our earthly food, in going on the way, in hearing the Word. If a man bee moued inwardly, when he heareth that the Word was made flesh, shall he kneele, as they doe in the Romane Church? If a man should kneele at euery inward motion of the minde, when hee heareth the Word; what confusion would there be in the Congregation?

                  The verball prayer vttered by the Pastor, and the mentall conceiued by the people, in the act of receiuing, is not an eiaculation, but necessary to be vsed in the action by the worthy Receiuers; for no man can receiue the body and the blood of Christ worthily, without a spirituall hunger and thirst after the righteousnesse and life that is in him: which spirituall appetite and desire, being declared by the Pastor in these or the like words, when he deliuereth the bread: Grant Lord, that by the vertue of thy body, which we receiue, we may haue life eternall, and be raised vp at the last day. And when hee deliuereth the Cup: Grant Lord, that by the vertue of thy blood, which we receiue, we may be purged from our sinnes, and filled with thy Spirit. And the Receiuers conceiuing, and confirming the same, by saying with their mouthes, as the custome was in the ancient Church, or in their hearts, Amen: They send not vp occasional eiaculations, but necessary and ordinary prayers, such as the nature of the action requires. Therefore, as I said before, although occasionall secret prayers may be offered to God, without any externall gesture, or with

such as the worshipper thinks meetest for the time; yet these, which are purposely conceiued in the ordinary and solemne act of diuine worshippe, should be presented to God, with such a gesture, as is conforme to the order prescribed, and receiued in the Church.

This comparison is odious & false: for there is no worship more lawfull then the prayers & blessings vttered by the Pastor, hauing the Elements disposed on the Table before him at the consecration: for this agrees both with the Institution, & hath our Sauiours example, as we said before. These comparisons serue to no other vse, but to extenuate idolatry, and discredite the Sacrament.

                     Perkins distinguisheth notably betweene publike, priuate, and secret worship: The secret and mentall worship must bee yeelded vnto God, and the signes thereof concealed from the eyes and hearing of men, as Nehemiah, when he prayed in presence of the King, Nehem. 2.4. In a word, the Institution, and the second Commandement hinder kneeling at this time, suppose mentall praier were the principall exercise of the soule.

                     Perkins speakes rightly: for if the worship be secret and mentall, it must be concealed from the eyes of men: but if it be mentall, and publike, such as are the prayers of the people in time of diuine Seruice, who mentally follow the prayer publikely vttered by the Pastor, these mentall prayers must be offered with such external signes of adoration, as are vsed in the Congregation. But in the act of receiuing, say yee, that cannot bee, because it is a breach of the second Commandement, and of the Institution: I answere, That reason of yours is the caption called Petitio principij, to take that for granted which is in question, and I may truely say, already confuted. So that there remaines now no more question, but that wee may both pray and kneele in the act of receiuing, without breach of the second Commandement, and most agreeably to the Institution.

                  I heare there is alledged a third sort of prayer, to wit, that the very act of receiuing is of it selfe a reall prayer. Is not this as much, as to say, That crauing, and receiuing is all one? Bellarmine saith, that prayer of it selfe, and of the owne proper office, doth impetrate; and that a sacrifice hath the force and power of obtaining and impetrating, because it is quaedam oratio realis, non verbalis, a certaine reall prayer, not a verball. Wee may forgiue him to say this of the sacrifice of the Masse, where there is an offering of a sacrifice to God: but Bellarmine was neuer so absurd, as to call the act of receiuing from God, a reall prayer to God.

                  No man, I thinke, will alledge, that the act of receiuing is praying, or crauing, although these two may agree well together. But it is true, that the celebration of this Sacrament is a reall thanksgiuing to God for the benefite of our redemption; and although it be not a propitiatorie,

or impetratorie sacrifice, as Bellarmine saith, yet it is eucharisticke, and a commemoration of the propitiatory, and impetratory sacrifice of Christ: And in the very act of receiuing, and by the act of receiuing, wee doe openly acknowledge and confesse before the world, that our confidence of saluation is onely in the sacrifice of the Lord Iesus Christ; which is, a reall praysing, magnifying, extolling, and preaching of his death vntill his comming againe. Now to conclude, yee haue made many long answeres to a short obiection, and notwithstanding the argument remaines in force. Your obiection proponed was this:
Wee may pray in the act of receiuing, therefore wee may kneele.
                  
                  Your first answere to this obiection was, That kneeling is not the onely proper and commendable gesture of prayer, and thereupon concluded, we might not kneele. This, as we haue shewed, is not a good consequence.
                  Next, yee answered, that to pray in the act of deliuery is against the Institution. This we haue confuted.
                  Thirdly, you answered, that wee ought not to pray before a creature: and therefore might not pray in the act of receiuing. The antecedent of this is false, as wee haue shewed: at least, as it is conceiued, and the conclusion holds not.
                  Fourthly, yee sayd, that we are not commanded by the act of Perth to pray; and therefore that we may not pray. This followes not.
                  Fifthly, because the prayer of the people in the act of receiuing is mentall, yee inferred, that they might not kneele▪ and this is no good consequence.
                  Lastly, yee sayd, wee may not kneele before the Crucifixe, and before Nebuchadnezzars Image, and therefore we may not kneele in the act of receiuing the Sacrament. And this is most absurd, the Sacrament being a part of Gods worship, instituted by himselfe: but the vse

of Idols and Images in his worship he hath expressely forbidden. So all your answeres are meere sophisticall captions and abductions from the purpose: yet yee proceede to answere some others, that yee frame against your selfe.

                  Their other obiection, that we may praise God in the act of receiuing, therefore wee may kneele, may bee answered after the same manner. There is no publike thanksgiuing ordained to be made at the deliuery of the Elements: mentall praise therefore must be meant. Mentall praise is no more the principall worke of the soule, then mentall prayer: what was sayd of the ejaculations of the one, let it bee applyed to the short ejaculations of the other.

                  If yee answere this obiection as yee did the former, then let the reply vsed by me be here repeated. But I say further, that by the words of the Institution, Doe this in remembrance of me, we are ordayned, not onely mentally to giue praise, but also really, and publikely by the very action and celebration of the Sacrament it selfe: in respect whereof the learned Pareus calleth this remembrance, 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                      
                     fiduciae & gratitudinis, that is, a remembrance of faith, because by it our faith is confirmed: and a remembrance of thanksgiuing, because by it we should praise and magnifie (as he saith) the clemencie of the Father, who gaue the Sonne; and the benignitie of the Sonne, who offered himselfe a sacrifice for vs.

                  The name of the Eucharist giuen to this Sacrament helpes them nothing, for it is a name giuen by the Ancients, and not by the Scripture.

                  The Trinitie is a name giuen by the Ancients, and not by the Scripture, to the three Persons subsisting in the

vnitie of the diuine nature, yet the truth of that which the word signifies, being found in Scripture, it helpes to conuince Heretikes, that deny the same: so the name of the Eucharist giuen to the Sacrament, to declare the thankfull commemoration of our Sauiours death, which thereby we performe according to the Scripture, helpes vs much against you and your followers, that spoile the Sacrament of the most principal end, for which it was instituted, that is, to the praise and honor of our Sauiour; in respect whereof, it is called Sacrificium Eucharisticum, a Sacrifice of thankesgiuing. This Sacrifice the Pastor really acts, in taking, blessing, breaking, and giuing of the externall Elements; for thereby the death of Christ, and the application thereof to the faithfull is represented: and it is acted by the people, in their taking, eating, and drinking, for thereby they declare and testifie the hunger, thirst, and desire of their soules after the righteousnesse and life of Christ, and the ioy they haue in the meditation thereof, with that assured confidence wherwith they rest, and repose themselues therupon. And this representation and application of Christs death, with the testification of our faith therein, and thankfulnesse therefore, by the celebration of the Sacrament, is a reall extolling, preaching, magnifying and praising of the Lords death, from which, mentall praise cannot be separated without hypocrisie▪ Therefore to praise God in the act of receiuing, is a chiefe part of the principall work of the soule, and not your meditation vpon the analogie betweene the signe, and the thing signified, which is only a catechetick preparation, that should precede the principall worke. If yee had remembred the Confession of Faith, which ye professe you

Sect. thereof about the end, yee haue these words: The end and cause of Christs Institution, and why the selfe-same should bee vsed, is expressed in these words, Doe this in remembrance of mee, as oft as yee eate of this bread, and drinke of this Cuppe▪
                        
yee shall shew foorth, that is, extoll, preach, magnifie, and praise the Lords death till he come. If this be the principall end, as yee see our Confession speakes, of Christs Institution, then, not onely may wee praise him in the act of receiuing, but we ought to praise him. In respect of this, the Sacrament is called the Eucharist, and not in respect of the thanksgiuing, wherewith we begin the action, as yee would haue it to be in your words following.

                  Next, as it is called Eucharistia, so it is called Eulogia: for the words, He gaue thanks, and He blessed, are indifferently vsed by the Euangelists.

                  Although the name were taken, as Causabone saith, from one part of the action, yet it is giuen to the whole action, not by reason of this part onely, but because it declares the nature and chiefe end of the action: and albeit all the parts of this holy ministration seuerally considered, are not actions of thanksgiuing, yet the whole action, which consists of these parts, being performed Gratitud

                     , as Paraeus saith, that is, with a purpose of thankfulnesse to celebrate the death of Christ, is Eucharisticke, or an action of thankesgiuing. The hand or foot being seuerally considered, is not the bodie, yet the whole, which consisteth of all the parts, is the body. So it is true, to take the bread is not an action of thankesgiuing, nor to breake it, nor to giue it, being seuerally considered; but to take, breake, blesse and giue, with intention by these actions to represent the death of Christ, and the application thereof to the faithfull, for the praise of

his glorious grace, is an action of thankesgiuing. Therefore to conclude, as wee come to the Sacrament to bee made partakers of Christs death by faith vnto saluation▪ so wee come to the Sacrament to celebrate the remembrance of his death to his glory. In respect of the first end, it is, The Communion of his body and bloud, & in respect of the last, it is a reall predication and celebration of his death, till his comming againe; which should bee often performed, because, as Paraeus speaketh, Mors Domini perpetuis laudibus celebranda est, that is, The death of Christ is to be celebrated with perpetuall praises: these are specially offered at the celebration of the holy Sacrament, and in this respect it is called 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉

                  I neuer heard this obiection vsed by any man, but by you in this place, therefore if it bee false, your selfe that forged it, is author of the falsehood. The Bishop of Galloway, who is now at rest, hath this obiection in his Treatise, which is not yet answered, as he alledgeth:

                        Whatsoeuer spirituall benefit I may lawfully aske on my knees▪ the same I may lawfully receiue vpon my knees with thankesgiuing.
                        But I may lawfully with supplication, aske saluation by Iesus Christ on my knees.
                        Therefore I may lawfully receiue it on my knees.
                     
                  
                  Another argument was propounded in the Assembly at Perth, which neither at that time, nor since hath been answered, and it is this.
                  
                     
                     Whatsoeuer spirituall benefit we should receiue in a solemne act of diuine worship, with thankesgiuing and prayer, that wee may receiue on our knees.
                     The body and blood of Iesus Christ, in the Sacrament, is a spirituall benefit, which in a solemne act of diuine worship, wee ought to receiue with thankesgiuing and prayer.
                     Therefore we may receiue the body and blood of the Lord Iesus Christ, in the Sacrament, vpon our knees.
                  
                  The proposition of this argument, at that time denied, was proued thus:

                        Whatsoeuer benefit we ought to receiue with thankesgiuing and prayer, that we ought receiue with the gesture that is most agreeable to thankesgiuing and prayer.
                        Kneeling is such a gesture, &c. Ergo, &c.
                     
                  
                  In the Assumption it is affirmed, that Christs body and blood in the Sacrament, should be receiued with prayer and thankesgiuing: This we proue by this reason;

                        Whatsoeuer spirituall benefit we should receiue with a spirituall hunger and thirst, and with a spirituall appetite and desire after the grace and vertue that is therein to saluation: the same we should receiue with prayer, which is nothing else, but such an appetite and desire.
                        But the body and blood of Christ is such a benefit, &c.
                        
                     
                  
                  Next that it should be receiued with thankesgiuing, I proue:

                        Whatsoeuer benefit we should receiue by extolling, and preaching, and magnifying, and praysing the inestimable worth and excellence thereof, the same we ought to receiue with thankesgiuing.
                        But in the Sacrament, we should receiue the body and the blood of Christ, with extolling and preaching, &c. Ergo, &c.
                     
                  
                  The Assumption is confirmed by the words of our Sauiour, Doe this in remembrance of me, and by the words of Saint Paul, So oft as yee eate this bread, and drinke this Cup, yee

shall declare, that is, extoll, magnifie, and praise, The Lords death till hee come againe. Because I finde you fighting against your owne shadow, I thought good to set downe the very obiections, which were vsed in the Assembly at Perth, that as yet are not, nor I hope shall euer be answered.

                  It is againe obiected, That in the act of receiuing, we receiue from Christ an inestimable benefite: ought not a Subiect kneele, when he receiueth a benefite from a Prince, to testifie his thankfulnesse? Answ. This relation from Christ to the Sacrament as betweene the Giuer, and the gift, is common to all the Sacraments both of the old and new Law, ordinarie, and extraordinarie.

                  The relation betweene the Giuer and the gift, in the old Testament is not so euident, because they wanted a cleare and expresse Word to expound the mysterie: Where haue yee such a Word concerning Circumcision? This is the putting off of the bodie of sinne, by the vertue of Christs Death and Resurrection, COLOS. 2.11. or concerning the Passeouer, This is the body of Christ, that is broken for you, this is his blood, that is shed for you? The Law had but the shaddow, the Gospell hath the expresse Image of good things to come: In the Law they had the shadow of the Giuer, and the gift, but in the Gospell we see him with open face. Now although to the shadow of the Prince men fall not downe, nor doe reuerence, they are to be excused; but he must bee reputed a contemner, who will not doe homage at the presence of his Prince. Further, as I said before, the externall actions of their Sacrament, could not bee commodiously

performed with such a gesture, as is kneeling, but the action of our Sacrament may.

                  Next, we receiue the mysticall pledges, not out of the hands of God himselfe, or his Sonne Christ immediately, but out of the hand of the Minister. The person who receiues the gift from the King, is supposed to receiue it immediately: and suppose mediatly, yet ceremonies of Court, and mediate ciuill worships, are not rules of religious adoration, which should euer be immediate.

                  Thirdly, the manner of deliuery of the gift, and the will of the Giuer, are to be considered. If the Prince call his Nobles to a banquet, it is his will that they sitte at table with him, as Ionathan and Dauid sate at King Sauls table. Christ hath declared by the Institution, after what manner he would haue vs to receiue these mysticall pledges. Kneeling cannot agree with the actions and precepts of the Institution.

                  If we consider the manner of deliuery of the gift, and the will of the Giuer, it fauoureth kneeling, rather then sitting: for although we be inuited to a banquet,

yet it is not a bodily repast, such as Ionathan and Dauid receiued at Sauls table. That required leisure and time, and such a site and position of bodie, as

                      it manifest, that the banquet whereunto wee are called, is the body and blood of Iesus, giuen externally in a little quantitie of bread, and one Cuppe diuided amongst many, and ministred internally with Christs owne hand. Neyther come wee to this banquet to feede our bodies, but to feede our soules, and to extoll and praise his death, as I haue ofte said before. Whereupon the Apostle inferreth, that wee should receiue worthily, that is, with such a reuerence, both externall and internall, as is worthie the Giuer, and the gift, and is most meete to set foorth the praise of the Giuer, and the worth of the gift. In this respect, kneeling is most agreeable, both to the actions and precepts of the Institution.

                  The second breach of the second Commandement, made by kneeling, is the shew of conformitie with the Papists. The Lord forbade his people to bee like the Gentiles, Leuit. 18.3. and 19.27. and Deut. 12. The Christians were forbidden to decore their houses with Bay-leaues and greene boughes, because the Pagans vsed so to doe; or to rest from their labours vpon the dayes that the Pagans did. If conformitie in things not hauing state in idolatrous seruice, but onely glauncing at the honour of the Idoll bee condemned, farre more is conformitie in the grossest act, wherein the life and soule of their idolatrie standeth. Such is the gesture of kneeling amongst the Papists, this outward conformitie tickleth the Papists, and offendeth the godly.
               
               
                  
                  ANS.
                  A shew of conformitie with the Papists in Idolatrie, is a breach of the second Commandement: But to kneele at the Sacrament, our hearts being freed of the opinion of Transubstantiation, and our mouthes confessing and professing, that we doe onely kneele to God, and our Sauiour Iesus Christ; is no more conformitie with them in idolatrie, then in the action of prayer to kneele, when we direct our prayers to God, and not to Angels or Saints, or other creatures. For example, To kneele, and say the Lords Prayer in honour of the Saints, and to offer it as a libell of request to be presented, and commended by their prayers to God, which Papists professe themselues to doe, (Costeri Enchiridion de veneratione Sanctorum,) is idolatrie; yet to kneele, and offer that prayer to God only, as wee doe, is not idolatrie: although both in the gesture of kneeling, and in the substance of the prayer, there bee a conformitie, our Faith and profession being contrarie to theirs, freeth vs of all shew of conformity with them in superstition and idolatry. But the Lord forbade his people (yee say) to be like the Gentiles, yet did he neuer forbid them to knele, and lift vp their hands to him in their prayers, although the Gentiles kneeled, and lifted vp hands vnto their gods when they prayed. The things wherein God forbade his people a conformity, were vncleannesse, idolatry, superstition, witchcraft, &c. and not such ceremonies of diuine worship, as are by himselfe commanded, yet abused by Idolaters. And where yee say, that Christians were prohibited to rest those dayes, on which the Pagans rested, I hope yee will not haue vs to worke on the Lords day, because the Papists rest that day. Finally, when yee say, that the life of Popish idolatrie consisteth in kneeling,

yee speake falsely; for the life of their idolatrie consisteth in a professed adoration of the bread, with opinion of Transubstantiation, and not in the outward gesture of kneeling, which being lawfull, and religious in it selfe, is onely abused by them to idolatrie. And doe not all they who sitte at the Sacrament, keepe an outward conformitie with the Arrians, who will needs sitte, to declare, that they esteeme Christ Iesus to bee onely a meere man? By your argument, all they are transgressours of the first Commandement, that communicate with them in sitting. Now to that which yee adde in the end, that this outward conformitie tickles the Papist, and offends the godly: yee are greatly mistaken; it is your contentious opposition against the truth, and disobedience of the lawfull ordinances of the Church, which tickles the Papist, and grieues all good men▪ and not our conformitie, in a lawfull and religious ceremonie.

                  The third breach of the second Commandement, made by kneeling, is the retaining the monument of vile idolatrie; all human inuentions polluted with idolatrie, except they be of necessarie vse, ought to bee remoued from Gods seruice. This gesture had a spot of prophanation from the beginning; being at the first birth in this act dedicated to idolatrie. The brasen Serpent set vp at Gods owne command, was not spared when it was abused: Wee detest the very garment of a theefe, or a whoore, thought it bee innocent: BEZA saith, many things may bee tollerated for the weake, which may not bee restored after they are taken away: he comm

                  You make the third breach of the second Commandement by kneeling, the retaining of a monument of vile idolatrie; and in this yee erre, for kneeling is a religious ceremony appointed by God himselfe to bee vsed in all actions of adoration, and was not of humane inuention; therefore cannot be a monument of idolatrie in this or any other act. If it be abused to idolatry, although abuse the thereof should bee abhorred, yet the religious gesture it selfe, is not to be detested. Let the theefe bee hanged, and the whoore drowned, yet the religious ceremony must bee restored to the right owner, to whom all knees should bow. The burning of Incense was a part of the ceremoniall worship vnder the Law, and abused to idolatrie, when it was offered to the brazen Serpent; yet that part of worship was not abolished, but the Idoll it selfe destroyed, and the ceremony restored to God, vnto whom of right it belonged. Neither hath your comparison of the brazen Serpent, and kneeling, any force in it; for the brazen Serpent, in the time it was abolished, had no vse: that ceased with the vertue of the cure, that the Israelites receiued by looking vpon it; the act of kneeling continueth alwayes in a necessary vse, for the better expressing of our thankfulnesse to God. And where you say, that kneeling from the first birth in this act, hath been dedicated to idolatrie, I flatly deny it: for albeit Honorius a foure hundreth yeares since, or there about, was the man that decreede kneeling to bee vsed in the eleuation, and circumgestation of the Hoste; yet it was not he, that brought in that gesture at the time of participation. In the eleuation or circumgestation, the same, I grant, was abused to idolatry, but neither th
                        •
                     se, nor the Hoste in them, were the Sacrament; for

when the bread or cup are not vsed according to the Institution, they cease to be the Sacrament; 
                        •
                     o kneeling directed to the bread at the eleuation, &c. was not a prophanation of it at the Sacrament, but a prophanation of it in a superstitious, and idolatrous worship. In respect of this, Caluine and some other recent Diuines, haue disliked it; and yet they say, if kneeling in the action of the Supper, did not rest in the Elements, but were directed to Christ sitting in heauen, the same were a lawfull sort of adoration. This Peter Martyr said, whose words are Neque externa adoratio esset mala, multi enim piè genua flectunt, & adorant, that is to say, Externall adoration in that case, were not euill, for many piously bow their knees, and adore. Beza in his twelfth Epistle, saith, That the bowing of the knee at the receiuing of the Elements, is a sort of holy and Christian reuerence, Ac proindè olim potuit cum fructu vsurpari, that is, of old, it might haue been vsed profitably. That testimony which you cite out of the eight Epistle, according to your custome, yee corrupt, to make it serue your purpose: for Beza commending them that abolished kneeling at the receiuing of the Sacrament, saith not, tanquam apertas idolomanias, but non minus quam apertas idolomanias, and so distinguisheth it from idolatrie: like as a little before in the same Epistle, he saith, That this gesture of kneeling being considered in it selfe, is not impious; and in his twelfth Epistle speaking of the same matter, he hath these words, Interim tamen cum ista per se non sint idololatrica, idem de illis, quod de proximè praecedentibus sentimus. So we haue Caluine, Martyr and Beza, all of them contradictors to you in this, that kneeling at the Sacrament is a monument of vile idolatry. Where I marke further, that in Beza his iudgement, kneeling was not at the first birth, in this act, dedicated to idolatry, for he saith of it, quòd olim potuit cum fructu vsurpari,
                     
that of olde time, it might haue beene vsed profitably, and the words hee subioynes make this yet more manifest, Tamen quia ex hoc fonte orta est artolatria; If Bread-worship did spring from kneeling according to his minde, then kneeling at the Sacrament, was in vse before Bread-worship, and so was not dedicated, as yee say, to idolatrie in this act from the first birth thereof. But to the end, the weakenesse of your Achillean argument may appeare, let vs put it in forme:
Whatsoeuer ceremonie in an act of diuine worship, such a
                           •
                         the Sacrament is, hath been dedicated to idolatrie from the first time it was vsed, in that act, the same is to bee remoued from the act, as a monument of vile idolatrie.
                  
                  To this I answere, that wee must consider the ceremonie it selfe, whether it bee of humane or diuine institution; if it bee of humane institution, it may be remooued, such as is the crossing of the bread and cuppe in the Sacrament: But if the ceremony bee of diuine institution, such as kneeling is, for the same is commended by God vnto vs in his Word: then wee ought to consider, whether the abuse of that ceremonie hath proceeded from the nature of the action, wherein it was vsed: for if it bee so, it ought to be abolished in that action, because it can neuer bee purged from the spotte which it contracteth by the action; and in such a case, the action and gesture ought both to bee abolished. But if the abuse proceede not from the nature of the action, but from the opinion of the agent; then the opinion being remoued, the religious ceremonie may bee vsed without any prophanation of idolatrie: for example, The abuse of kneeling in eleuation, &c. proceeded not onely from the opinion of the agent, but from the nature of the

action, which is idolatrous and superstitious: kneeling in this action cannot be purged from the contagion of idolatry, because of the relation it hath to the idolatrous action: and therefore both the action and the gesture ought to bee abolished. But the Sacrament of the Supper being an action instituted by GOD, and kneeling being of the owne nature an holy, and religious ceremony, it can neuer receiue contagion of idolatrie from it, but onely from the opinion of the agent: then remooue the opinion, both the action it selfe may bee rightly vsed, and kneeling therein, as being very agreeable to the nature of the action. For wee cannot deny, that CHRIST in this action is to be adored, and of that wee giue euident testimony, euen when wee sit at Table; for our sitting bare-hea

There is a naturall pronenesse in all men to idolatry, great ignorance in the common people, and superstition rooted in the hearts of men: Papists daily encrease, the idoll of the breadie god is still in great account in the Romane Churches round about vs, & in priuate corners amongst vs:

and yet men are not ashamed to say, that all memory of former superstition is past, and no perill is to be feared againe. The Virgins in Cyprians time, granted they walked with yong men, talked with them, went to b

Cyprian answeres, Non est locus dandus Diabolo: nemo diu tutus periculo proximus: Place should not be giuen to the Diuell: no man is long safe, who is neere the point of danger. The Belgick Churches in their Synods permitted not libertie of kneeling, for the same respect of bread worship, as may be seene in the harmonie of their Synods, set forth of late, by FESTVS HOMMIVS, Liberum est stando, sedendo, vel

Information by preaching is a sufficient remedie; meate doth not nourish so fast, as poyson doth corrupt. The watchmen are sometime ignorant, or negligent, many want doctrine▪ it is better to fill vp the pit▪ then to set one beside it, to warne the passengers, that they fall not in: such ceremonies ought to be appointed, which by their goodnesse and edification may helpe the preaching of the Word, and not such as the Word daily must haue need to correct: the strength of many poore Christian soules, should not bee tryed by bringing them to the very brinke of danger.

                  Your fourth breach is the occasion and danger of idolatry. But kneeling imports no more danger, nor occasion of idolatry, then sitting doth of prophanation and contempt of the Sacrament: and with vs there be many moe prophane Christians, then idolatrous Papists; and people are farre more ready by sitting to take occasion of despising the Sacrament, their senses

leading them to esteeme basely of it, then by kneeling, to thinke the bread and wine to be the body and blood of Christ materially; the same being against sense and reason, and the doctrine of the Word, which teacheth them the contrary. The Virgins in Cyprians time, by walking and talking, and lying with yong men, did expose themselues to vncleannesse, and as Cyprian saith, gaue place to the Diuell; but the lawfull vse of a religious ceremony, can neuer be the occasion of idolatrie, nor can the vse of it giue place to the Diuell: Res bonae neminem scandalizant, saith TERTVLLIAN de velandis Virginibus, nisi malam mentem. That is, good things giue offence to none, but an euill minde. The iudgement of the Belgick Churches, we reproue not, because they know best, what serues to the edification of their Churches; nor will they (I hope) reprooue our iudgement concerning kneeling, which is grounded vpon reasons as expedient for our estate, as any can be alledged by them, for their owne: but the liberty which they giue to celebrate the Sacrament with the gesture of sitting, standing, or passing, condemnes 
                        •
                     latly your opinion, of the necessity of sitting, which neuer any Church or Diuine, ancient or moderne did hold, except your selfe; yet pardon me for reckoning you amongst the Diuines. As to the feare of Bread-worship, it will neuer be caused by the religious vse of kneeling, but by some peruerse disposition of the Receiuer, which nothing can remedie sufficiently, but right information made by sound doctrine. It is true, that to the vncleane, all things are vncleane: a soule that is euill disposed, may like a Spider conuert into poyson the iuyce of the same flower which the Bee turneth into hony: out of the sacramentall Word, This is my body, which is broken for you, the Papist draweth the poyson of Transubstantiation; but the true Christian, the sweet and spirituall

participation of the body of our Lord. The word giues not to the Papist an occasion of his errour, but he takes occasion at the Word, because of the peruerse disposition of his minde; so kneeling being a religious ceremonie, and commanded by God, when it is lawfully vsed at the receiuing of the Sacrament, can neuer giue occasion of Bread-worship, although superstitious men hauing corrupted their mindes, may make it an occasion of that, and worse. The gesture of sitting is at this day abused by Arrians, and made a signe of their deniall of the God-head of Christ; and prophane Christians haue taken, and daily take occasion thereby, to fall into the pit of contempt, and prophanation of this Sacrament, from which inconuenience, no ceremonies that can be chosen, will preserue them, except they be warned daily, and directed by the Word how to carry themselues; and if we neglect this, committing their safetie to the ceremonies of sitting, standing, walking, or kneeling, we shall not only bring them to the brinke of danger, but shall drowne them in the depth, either of prophanenesse, or of superstition and idolatry. Now, if you thinke that there is greater danger of idolatrie to be feared from kneeling, then of prophanenesse from sitting, you are much deceiued: for if wee consider the disposition of our people, amongst whom, some I confesse haue vnderstanding, & yet are inclined to superstition & idolatry; the greater company are simple ones, that neuer did, nor euer will, as it is to be supposed, take occasion by kneeling, to thinke the bread the bodie of Christ, or yet to adore it for his body. This errour was brought in by the Clergie and Scholastickes, wherof the people could neuer haue dreamed, if it had not been daily inculcate into their eares, and they perswaded so to thinke, by the false interpretation of the words, This is my body. The right exposition of the

same hath remoued that error, and must still debarre it, not the gesture of sitting; for thereby simple ones are ready, by their owne inclination, to take occasion, as wee haue knowne in time past, of contemning the holy Sacrament, and so from superstition to runne into a profanation of the Lords Body: from eyther of these extremities no thing can preserue them, but the trauels of a faithfull Pastor, in Catechizing and Preaching. As to men of vnderstanding they are in lesse danger, and howsoeuer they receiue sitting, standing, or kneeling, they know the Elements in the Sacrament to retaine their former substance, and that they are changed in the vse onely. Neither haue such of them, as are inclined to Papistrie, beene conuerted a jot by sitting, from their former errors; but to the contrarie, confirmed in their erronious opinions, disdayning our profession for the irreuerent celebration of the holy Sacrament, If at any time, by the doctrine of truth, they shall be conuerted from their errors, this gesture that is required of kneeling, shall bee a meanes to preserue them in a constant profession; and as I haue sayd, keepe them also from the other extremitie of contempt.

                     . This their pretended humilitie, is a naturall humilitie, like vnto Peters, when he refused, that Christ should wash his feete. Obedience is better then sacrifice.

                  The fifth breach yee alledge to be will-worshippe. The Apostle, Coloss. 2. defines will-worshippe to bee wilfull condemning, or thralling of men to the obseruation of such things in Gods worship as necessarie, whereof there is no certaintie in the Word of God, the Authors of the said obseruation being rashly puft vp by the mind of the flesh, ver. 18. Now whether yee, that haue no certaintie in the Word for sitting at the Sacrament, but such reasons onely, as we haue cleerely shewed to be rashly forged out of the minde of the flesh, and yet doe wilfully condemne and thrall mens consciences to the obseruation of that, as necessarie; or wee, who neyther vrge sitting nor standing, nor kneeling as necessary; but esteeming all indifferent, leaue the choyce vnto the Church, vpon whose iudgement it becommeth all men to rest in circumstantiall indifferent things: whether (I say) yee, or wee be guiltie of wil-worshippe, let the discreete and wise Christian iudge. Your example of Saint Peter makes not for you: for if our Sauiour had declared his will to vs concerning kneeling or sitting, as he did to him touching the washing of his feete, it had beene rebellion inexcusable in vs, to haue opposed thereto, vpon whatsoeuer pretext. No more doth Fenners saying helpe you, to which wee all subscribe.

The parts of Gods worshippe may not be applyed to other, when comlinesse, commodiousnesse, institution, and command will not suffer. A man may not kneele in al the time of Sermon:

he may not read in the act of receiuing, &c. To be short, A rite sacramentall, deuised by man, pretending humilitie, and shouldering out other rites instituted by GOD, cannot bee but presumptuous will-worshippe.

                  After ye haue propounded these fiue breaches of the second Commandement excogitate by your selfe, and neuer heard before in any Church, yee obiect, that kneeling is no new worshippe, but an action already appointed for Gods seruice, and applyed to the Supper. And yee answere, That the parts of Gods worship may not bee applyed to other, when comlinesse, commodiousnesse, institution, and command will not suffer. This answere no man will deny; yet, yee take paynes, as Sophists are wont to doe, to prooue that which is not controuerted. The point we denie is this, that comlinesse, commodiousnes, institution, and command, permitteth not kneeling to bee vsed in the act of receiuing. This yee haue not prooued, nor bring yee any argument now to prooue it: but simple people will not perceiue your cunning and finenesse. In a word, kneeling is not, as yee affirme, a sacramentall rite, but a religious ceremony flowing from the relikes of that naturall pietie, wherein man was created▪ approued, and committed by God himselfe to be vsed in all such parts of his worship, as edification, order, and decency allowes. To debarre this from the Sacrament, by sitting, a gesture neuer commanded to be vsed in Gods worship, yet vrged by you, with opinion of necessitie, pretending the humilitie of obedience, where yee haue neither precept nor president; is indeed a subtill catching of the simple conscience in the yarne and net of wil-worship.

In a large sense euery act whereby God is honoured, may be called the worship of God, as oathes, vowes, and sacrifices, &c But adoration is the worshippe of God in a strict sense. Kneeling is the gesture of adoration, but not of euery part of Gods worshippe. Receiuing, eating, drinking in the Sacrament, are parts of Gods worshippe; but they are not gestures of adoration. All the Sacraments both of Iewes and Christians, were parts of Gods worshippe, as well as the Eucharist, and yet they kneeled not in the act of participation.

As to the Sacraments of Circumcision and Baptisme, the externall acts of them (I speake of Baptisme as it was vsed in these times, when men went downe into the water, and were baptized) could not bee commodiously performed with kneeling: But I thinke it were no sinne, if a man of perfect yeeres, comming to be baptized, should kneele: and contrarywise, it were vndecent for him, not to kneele at the inuocation of the Name of the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghost. As to the Passeouer

we haue often answered, that it was a full repast, and could not be commodiously celebrated with kneeling: as no gesture is of necessary vse, so none is to bee chosen which is not commodious.

The Eucharist is a sacrifice, and congeries sacrificiorum, a heape of sacrifices, a commemoratiue sacrifice, a sacrifice of a broken and contrite heart, of prayse, of prayer, of almes: therefore this Sacrament should be receiued with kneeling, saith the Bishoppe of Rochester: and therefore the gesture of kneeling is rightly applyed to such a kinde of worship. Answ. The actions afore sayd are called Sacrifices onely by analogie, and metaphorically. They are not proper sacrifices. The inuisible sacrifice, by the which a man offers himselfe by contrition, inward deuotion, mortification, is the daily sacrifice of a Christian, Rom. 12.1. We offer our selues to be sacrificed when the Word is preached, Rom. 15. We kneele not when wee giue almes. These improper and metaphoricall sacrifices are not acts of adoration. The Paschall Lambe was slaine in the manner of a reall sacrifice, and yet notwithstanding this immolation, they kneeled nor at the eating of the Paschall Lambe The Sacraments of the old and new Testament were alike in representation, signification, and exhibition.

                  Howsoeuer the sacrifices aforesaid be metaphoricall, as yee say, and no proper sacrifices, yet they are spirituall sacrifices, which men are accustomed to offer with kneeling. Although wee kneele not when we giue almes, yet we kneele when we pray & praise. The sacrifice of the Passeouer, and other sacrifices vnder

the Lawe, although when they were eaten in priuate houses, they did not kneele that eat them, because it could not be done conueniently, for the reasons oft recited: yet it appeares, when they were offered on the Altar, which was the publike act of Gods worship, that they bowed their knees. So Micheas, Cap. 6. vers. 6. and Saint Luke saith in his first, that when Zacharie was offering Incense, all the people continued praying: which they did not without kneeling, or some other externall rite of adoration. Where yee affirme, that the Sacraments of the old and new Testament were alike in representation, signification, and exhibition; it is true, as touching the matter represented, but the manner was as farre different, as the shaddow is from the expresse and perfect image of the thing it selfe. The sacrifices of the olde Testament were but shaddowes of Christ▪ our Sacraments, by reason of the Word annexed to them, and the doctrine of the Gospell, whereby they are cleerely expounded, are viue and perfect images of Christ, and of the benefites wee haue by him; therefore they are to bee celebrated with greater adoration and deuotion, both externall and internall, then the sacrifices vnder the Law, because our deuotion and adoration should be proportioned to the measure of our knowledge and faith.

                  I am assured, if kneeling be warranted by practise of the ancient Church, no good Christian will thinke for the friuolous reasons adduced by you, that they committed any of these breaches. But you labour to proue, that the ancient Church did not practise it▪ for yee say, that when the Arrians denyed Christs true diuinitie, the Orthodoxe Church, who acknowledged his diuinitie, kneeled not in the act of receiuing, which had beene expedient, if the same had beene lawfull: vnto which I answere, That there be many things expedient to be done, which notwithstanding are not done, nor ought to be done; not because they are vnlawfull in themselues, but for some other respect, as some custome receiued, or some order formerly established, which vpon euery apparant expedience is not to be altered: for example, It was expedient, because of the same heresie, to haue kneeled at all times, when publike prayers were offered to Christ, or to the Father in his name: yet on the Lords day, which was the most solemne time of worship, the ancient Church kneeled not at publike prayer; not because it was vnlawfull in it selfe to haue kneeled, but because there was an order receiued in the Church, that on the Lords day the people should stand and not kneele.
                  Next, when yee say, that the ancient Church did not kneele at the receiuing of the Sacrament, and will prooue it by this, that it was the custome of the Church to stand in the time of publike prayer all the Lords dayes in the yeere, and on euery day from Easter to Pentecost, because of the ioyfull memory of Christs resurrection: for, say yee, this Sacrament, being a matter of great ioy, far lesse would they

So it is not the nature of the action that will enforce the gesture of standing to haue been vsed in the Sacrament rather then at prayer, but the custome and order of the Church only; which if ye were able to produce

as well for standing at the Sacrament, as at praying on the Lords day, your argument were strong: but that yee shall neuer doe, except ye grant according to the truth, that the Sacrament is an act of reall adoration. In that case Tertullians testimony, which you cite, would aduance your cause mightily, who sayes, De geniculis adorare nefas ducimus.
                  
                  Two or three testimonies of Eusebius, Chrysostome, and Tertullian, for standing on the Lords day at the Table, or Altar, when the Sacrament was receiued, will not proue a constant and vniuersall practise of that gesture. Neyther is the example of the Abissines, and Muscouites, who stand to this day, able to counterpoyse the practise of the vniuersall Church, for the space of foure or fiue hundred yeeres preceding their dayes, wherein they kneeled at the receiuing. Nor are you able to prooue, that the gesture of kneeling was brought into the Church by the error of Transsubstantiation, as ye confidently affirme in the last line of this Section. For Honorius, as wee sayd before, did not decree kneeling to bee vsed at the receiuing of the Sacrament, but at the eleuation and circumgestation which was a superstitious and idolatrous worshippe inuented by man. And it is euident, at the time when that Decree was made, the people were accustomed to kneele at the receiuing; and if it had not beene the custome, there is no question, but the same would haue beene straitly enioyned by the same Decree. But it is playne, that before that time, as euer since, this gesture is continued in the Church: for as Saint Augustine vpon the 98. Psalme, testifies, No man doeth worthily receiue, but hee that adores. And in the same places hee saith, Non peccatur adorando carnem Christi, sed peccatur non adorando: that is, Wee sinne not in adoring Christs body in the Sacrament; but

we sinne, if wee adore it not. And Chrysostome in one of his Homilies hath these words, Ergo adora, & communica: that is, Adore then, and communicate, but vnto these, and the rest of the testimonies, yee answere, That it followeth not, because they adored, that therefore they kneeled, because (say yee) their testimonies make mention of adoration, not of the Sacrament, but of Christ in the Sacrament▪ and wee say the same, that at the Sacrament Christ only is to be adored, and not the sacramentall Elements, which are the signes. So in this wee agree; but because that maketh nothing against kneeling, yee subioyne, that their testimonies are to bee vnderstood of spirituall and internall adoration; and to confirme it, yee quote in the Margine D. Fulke, vpon the first to the Cor. 11. Sect. 18. But let the Reader peruse the place, he shall finde nothing in it against the gesture of kneeling, or any other religious signe of adoration; onely hee saith, that adoration, mentioned by the Fathers, is to be vnderstood of the spirituall adoration of Christ, and not of the externall adoration of the Sacrament. And if hee had meant otherwise, Chrysostomes words in the 24. Homilie, vpon the first to the Corinths, Cap. 10. cited by himselfe, would haue controlled his saying: Hoc corpus, etiam iacens in praesepi, reu
                           •
                        riti sunt Magi, &c. that is to say, The wisemen did reuerence to this body (he meanes the body of Christ,) lying in the Manger; and these wicked and barbarous men, leauing their houses and Countrey, hauing finished a long iourney, and comming to the place, they adored with great feare and trembling. Let vs therefore (sayeth hee) that are Citizens of heauen imitate these Barbarians. Thus farre Chrysostome. Now to imitate them, is not to come with inward reuerence onely, but to shew it also in outward

gesture; for of them the Scripture saith, That falling downe, they adored CHRIST. And it is manifest by the words following, that Chrysostome meanes not of the inward adoration onely, but also of the outward; Non solum hoc ipsum corpus vides, sicut illi, &c. Thou doest not onely see the same body as they did, but thou knowest both his power, and dispensation, and thou a
                        •
                     t ignorant of no thing done by him, as being exactly and accurately imitated in all mysteries. Let vs therefore stirre vp our selues with feare, Et longe maiorem quàm illi Barbari ostendamus reuerentiam: that is, Let vs shew foorth much more reuerence then these Barbarians. The word, Ostendamus, manifestly shewes that Chrysostome exhorteth his people not to the inward adoration of Christ onely at the Sacrament, but to the externall also. The practise of all Churches since the dayes of Christ confirmeth the same: for there was neuer any Church, wherein the Sacrament was receiued without some externall signe and gesture of adoration. To stand before the Lord in a solemne act of diuine worshippe, is a gesture of adoration: and as yee obserued before out of Drusius in the 51. Page of this Pamphlet, standing is taken for prayer, because it was the vsuall gesture at prayer. The discouering of the head in our Chu

And as in these actions, the discouering of the head is a signe of adoration, so is it in the receiuing of the Communion; and was so euen when wee did sit at the receiuing: for the reuerence of the bare head was not giuen at that time to the externall Minister, nor to the externall Elements, but to

                  The proofes already made for standing vpon the Lords day for 1000 yeeres in the Church, doe euince that geniculation had no place in the act of receiuing all that time. It hath therefore followed vpon bodily presence and transsubstantiation.

                  Your proofes haue euinced nothing, except yee grant, that to receiue the Sacrament is an act of adoration; for all the testimonies ye bring runne that way. And at most yee haue onely proued, that on the Lords day they stood at the Sacrament: whereupon if yee conclude, that geniculation had no place, yee must vpon the same ground, that sitting had no place: yea, it s
                        •
                     all euince, that sitting had no place in the Church, vnto the yeere 1560. at which time it was receiued in our Church: for after these 1000. yeeres, wherein yee proue that standing was vsed, kneeling succeeded, and hath continued euer since in the Church, vntill the time of reformation. So sitting was neuer in vse by your owne argument. As to the gesture vsed by our Sauiour at the Paschall Supper, which yee affirme was continued at the institution of the Sacrament, it was not sitting at a Table vpon fourmes or chaires, but lying, and leaning vpon beds: and it is vncertain, as I shewed

before, whether that gesture was continued or not; and albeit it had beene continued, there was neuer Church or Diuine, that thought it exemplary; for if they had done, they would neuer haue vsed standing, or passing, or kneeling in stead of it.
                  If we might bee bold to coniecture, with what gesture the Apostles receiued the Sacrament, as yee are bold to affirme that they sate; or what gesture Christ would haue vs to obserue; it were doubtlesse surest to thinke, that the Apostles receiued with that same gesture, which they vsed at the thanksgiuing and blessing, wherewith the Institution begins: and therefore that the gesture, which the Church thinketh most meet to be vsed at the thankesgiuing, is the gesture fittest for the people to receiue; because the action it selfe is a reall thankesgiuing, and should haue conioyned with it, the thankesgiuing and blessing, wherewith the action beginnes in the minde and affection of the receiuers: and because euer since the first Institution, wee finde the Church to haue vsed the same gesture at the receiuing, that they vsed at the thankesgiuing and prayer. For when for the space of a thousand yeeres, they stood and prayed, as you your selfe affirme, and so doth your namelesse Master of table gesture; then they stood, and receiued the Sacrament: and after that, when on the Lords day, the Church began, in stead of standing, to vse kneeling at prayer, they began also to receiue the Sacrament kneeling, which forme of receiuing hath continued to our times.
                  But to returne againe to your argument, where yee say, that the proofes made for standing doe euince, that for the space of a thousand yeeres kneeling had no place, I will let you see how futile your argument i

kneeled not for the space of a thousand yeeres. May you not by the very same reason conclude? The Church laboured not, nor fasted on the Lords day, for the space of a thousand yeeres: Ergo, they neither fasted nor laboured at al

                        xis in terram genibus, with their knees close to the ground; so with that same gesture they receiued the Sacrament, for the Church did euer receiue with the same gesture, which they vsed in prayer, as I haue proued by induction. The Apostles receiued with the same gesture, which they vsed at the thankesgiuing. This yee cannot denie, except yee ouerthrow all the grounds that yee laid, for the example and precept of Christ to bee obserued. The Church on the Lords day, hath euer vsed to stand at the Sacrament, when they stood at prayer, and if you can produce one instance to the contrarie, I shall pray you doe it; or if not, suffer mee to conclude against you; that as on the Lords day, when they stood and prayed, they also stood and receiued: so at that same time on the weeke dayes, when they kneeled and prayed, they kneeled and receiued: and this is proued by all these testimonies of the Ancients, wherein the people are exhorted to humble themselues externally at the Sacrament, as by the m

                     st cleare testimony of Chrysostom I cited before. Hereby it is manifest, that the gesture of kneeling followed not the errour of Transsubstantiation, but was receiued and retained in the Church on the Lords day, at publike prayer and receiuing

of the Sacrament, as it had been vsed before on the weeke-dayes, at these religious exercises. Thus following your owne foot-steps, and building on your owne grounds, kneeling is proued to haue been in vse in all ages, and with your owne hands, yee haue thrust sitting to the doore for the space of 1560. yeares.
               
            
            
               An answere to the last Section, entituled Kneeling, not practised in the Reformed Churches.
               
                  PP.
                  THe Lutheran Churches do acknowledge reall presence by way of Consubstantiation: it is no wonder therefore, that they approue kneeling. The Reformed Churches, as they damned bodily presence, so haue they reiected the gesture of kneeling in the act of receiuing. The Church of Bohemia hath retained this gesture since the dayes of Iohn Husse. In their Confession exhibited to King Ferdinand, anno 1535. it is thus said, Ministri verò Dominicae coenae verba referentes plebem ipsam ad hanc fidem hortantur, vt corporis Christi praesentiam adess
                           •
                         credant. The Ministers are willed to stirre vp the people to beleeue, that the bodie of Christ is present: the purer sort amongst them, as they haue reiected the errour of reall presence, so depart they from this gesture. In our neghbour Church, some of their defenders of kneeling, will not haue vs inquisitiue of the maner of Christs presence in the Sacrament. And the Bishop of Rochester commends the simplicity of the Ancients, which disputed not, whether Christ was present, con, sub, in, or trans
                     ▪ in this Supper. Sutton in his Appendix to his Meditations on the Lords Supper, condemnes likewise this diligent search of the maner of Christs presence. If the maner of Christs presence be not determined, there can arise no other, but a confused worship, of such a confused

and determinate presence. The Papists acknowledge that there ought to be no adoration, but where there is acknowledged a bodily presence in the Sacrament. Hence it is, that they proue mutually the one by the other.
                  It will not follow, that we may change sitting into kneeling, because the ancient Church, and some Reformed Churches, haue changed sitting into standing: because kneeling maketh so many breaches, both in the Institution, and in the second Commandement, and is no wayes a table gesture. By standing, we accommodate our selues to a table, to participate of the dainties set thereon: standing was neuer abused to idolatrie, as kneeling hath been; we are not bound to imitate other Churches further, then they imitate Christ. Our sitting is not Scottish Geneuating, but a commendable imitation of the Apostolicall Churches, and obedience to Christs Institution.
                  They flee vp at last to the Church Triumphant, and alledge for kneeling, the foure and twenty Elders falling downe before the Lambe: but how conclude they this, that they that are called to the Supper of the Lamb kneele at the Supper of the Lamb? And seeing the blessed soules shall not be clothed with their bodies before the Resurrection, how can they conclude materiall geniculation of the blessed Saints in heauen? All creatures in heauen, in earth, or vnder the earth, are said to bow their knee at the name of Iesus, that is, to acknowledge his Soueraigne authority, howbeit the celestial Angels, blessed soules, and infernall spirits, haue not knees to bow with. The euerlasting felicity of the children of God, is the Supper of glory; Doe they drinke continually of that felicity vpon their knees? Thousands, thousands stand before him; many shall come from the East, and from the West, and sitte at the heauenly Table

with Abraham, Isaack, and Iacob: may we not then conclude sitting and standing, as well as they do kneeling, if we looke to the letter of parables, visions, allegories and prophecies? but symbolicall theologie is not argumentatiue. Lastly, how will they prooue euidently, that the falling of the foure and twenty Elders before the Lambe, is to bee interpreted of the Church Triumphant, rather then of the Church Militant?

                  To proue that kneeling is not practised in the Reformed Churches, yee cut off in the beginning from their number the Lutherans, because they acknowledge the Reall presence by way of Consubstantiation. This I grant is an error, yet is it not directly fundamentall. They abhorre, as we doe, the Bread-worship, and they worship Christ in the Sacrament, as we should do; their errour is onely in the manner of his presence, which errour should not debarre them from the Communion of the Reformed Churches: with them yee reckon the Church of Bohemia, because in their Confession exhibited to King Ferdinand, anno 1535. they say, Ministri verò coenae Dominicae, &c. Let the Ministers when they rehearse the words of the Lords Supper, exhort the people to this faith, that they may beleeue the body of Christ to be present there. By this yee conclude, that some of them held the errour of Reall presence in the Sacrament; and yet their Confession mentioneth neither reall, nor corporall, nor locall presence. And it is no errour to beleeue the presence of Christs body in the Sacrament after some manner; as to beleeue that it is there obiectiue, that is, as the reall obiect, whereupon we must fixe and fasten our Faith: and to beleeue that it is there virtute, & efficacia, in vertue, and efficacie, to nourish and strengthen vs in newnesse of life heere, and

raise vs vp vnto eternall life hereafter: In respect whereof, Christ

                        quetars hold, through euery place with the Diuinitie: As by example, wheresoeuer a man is personally present, there his head, his body, & all his members are present, albeit the foot or the hand be not in the place where the head is, yet they are coniunctly present with the head, where the person is; and so as Christ is personally present at the Sacrament, so is his Diuinitie and Humanity coniunctly present in the Person. That to conclude, it is no errour according to the Confession aboue expressed, to beleeue the spirituall, powerfull, and personall presence of Christs bodie at the Sacrament, and in that respect to worship his flesh and blood there: yea, Saint Augustine saith, That it is sinne, not to worship his flesh there. But you must be excused to exclude all from your Communion, that beleeue any such thing, because yee haue denied before, that the Sacrament hath such a promise, and presence of Christ, as the Temple or Arke had vnder the Law, pag. 51. And pag. 50. yee denied, that it was a signe that should moue vs vpon the sight thereof,

vp men to adore the Principall, that is, Christ: And so yee doe acknowledge, that they are ordered of God to be signes only, and seales of his graces, without any promise, power, vertue, or presence of the bodie of Christ; that is the opinion of the Anabaptists. If these be they, whom yee call the purer sort amongst the Bohemians, I know not; this I know, that the Polonian Church esteemes them Arrians, who sitte at the Sacrament, whom I hope yee will not repute to be the purer sort, or reckon amongst the Reformed. Thirdly, if yee debar from the communion of the well reformed Churches, all who are of the Bishop of Rochester and Suttons minde, who commend their simplicitie, that beleeue Christs presence, and are not inquisitiue of the maner, but professe with Durandus, saying, modum nescimus, prasentiam credimus; then shall yee excommunicate from your societie, all that preferre the peace of the Church, to the loue of contention and curious disputes, that haue disquieted the Church, rent the body therof a sunder, and diuided the same in factions.
                  Where yee say, that if the maner of Christs presence be not determined, there can arise no other but a confused worship of such a confused, and indetermined presence: your allegation is but rash and prophane. Can yee determine the maner of Christs presence in heauen particularly? or the manner of God the Father his presence in heauen and earth, albeit we beleeue that God is in essence and power euery where, and that Christ is bodily in the heauens? These determinations are but generall, and confused notions; yet God forbid wee should say as yee doe, that the presence of the Father and the Sonne in heauen, and in earth, are confused, or that the worship is confused, that is giuen thereto according to Gods Word.
                  As to the Papists, who acknowledge (as yee say) that

there ought to be no adoration, but where there is a bodily presence acknowledged in the Sacrament, although yee be of the same minde, and thereupon condemne all adoration of Christ in the Sacrament, yet we

But if by the reformed Churches, yee vnderstand those, who distinguish betweene the signes and the things signified, giuing to the signes the reuerence due to them, and adoring onely the thing signified, to wit, the body and blood of Christ in the Sacrament of these, some, I confesse, do erre in esteeming Christs bodie to bee really and locally present: and yet, seeing they agree with vs in the chiefe and principall grounds of Religion, wee must not excommunicate them from the number of the reformed. But let vs lay aside these, whom yee call Vbiquetars: If yee hold the rest for Reformed Churches, that are in Germanie, Polonia, Bohemia, Hungaria, Denmark, Norway, and great Britaine, with the Church of Ireland; for one that sitteth at the receiuing of the Sacrament in all these Churches, they are an hundred that kneele.

                     esse heere to excuse them, or rather to mitigate your censure of them, saying first, that by standing, men accommodate themselues to a table, to participate of the dainties set thereon. Next, that standing hath neuer beene abused to idolatry, as kneeling hath bin: but these abuses are friuolous, and nothing worth; for in the Church of France, where they receiue standing, they doe no more accommodate themselues to a table, then they who kneele; for neither doe they reach their hand to the table, to take any thing to themselues therefrom, receiuing all from the hand of the Minister; nor doe they stand socially, as yee will haue sitting to be vsed for society and familiar entertainment; but first one or two commeth, and hauing receiued, they passe to giue place to others. Secondly, yee forget, or th
                        •
                     n are ignorant, that the Priest standeth, whilest hee saith Masse, and receiueth, adoring the Elements. And th
                        •
                     rfore kneeling was neuer more abused by the people, then standing is by the Priest. So as by these your excuses, the reformed Churches of France, and others, that stand at the receiuing of the Sacrament, are not liberate frō the breach of the Institution, & second Commandement, wherewith yee charge those that kneele.
                  In the end hauing condemned all for Idolaters, who kneele on earth at the Sacrament, yee ascend to heauen, and there yee deny that we are able to conclude, that they who are called to the Supper of the Lambe,

vsed by the Saints in adoration, which is attributed to the blessed Spirits in heauen metaphorically▪ and therefore that on earth there is no gesture more proper to be vsed in adoration, then the reuerend gesture of kneeling. Last of all, by the falling downe of the twentie foure Elders, it is euidently prooued, that thanksgiuing and praise may be offered to God on ou
                        •
                      knees, or in a gesture more humble, whether they bee interpreted to bee the Church militant, or triumphant.
                  Now to conclude: When all your reasons and discourses shall be considered by the iudicious Reader, he shall finde, that they all tend to the contempt of the Sacrament, and to leade men to a prophane estimation thereof: For first, yee maintaine, that it is to be celebrated with no other gesture then a common banquet for bodily repast. Secondly, that it is not in statu accommodato ad adorandum: that is to say, That it is not a signe or middest appointed to stirre vp the receiuers to worshippe their Sauiour. Thirdly, that Christ is eyther not present in the Sacrament at all, or that his body is not to bee esteemed present after any manner. Fourthly, that at the Sacrament neither his person, nor his body and bloud: that is, neither the giuer, nor the gift is to be adored. Finally, that all, who at the Sacrament adore him by bowing of their knees, are Idolaters, breakers of the second Commandement, and violators of the Institution. These are assertions very contrarious to the iudgement of the Primitiue Church, touching the Sacrament, which of all the parts of Gods worshippe, they esteemed the most principall; as Casaubone obserues out of the Ancients in his 16. Exercit. Sect. 58. which hee concludes with these words; Ex Augustin

                     FRom the beginning of the Reformation, to this present yeere of our Lord 1618. the Church of Scotland hath diuers wayes condemned the obseruation of all Holy-dayes, the Lords day onely excepted. In the first Chapter of the first Booke of Discipline penned, Anno 1560. the obseruation of Holy-dayes to Saints, the feast of Christmas, Circumcision, Epiphanie, Purification, and others fond Feasts of our Lady, are ranked amongst the abominations of the Romane Religion, as hauing neither commandement, nor assurance in the Word. It is further affirmed, that the obstinate maintainers, and teachers of such abomination should not escape the punishment of the Ciuill Magistrate. The Booke aforesaid was subscribed by the Lords of secret Counsell.

Holy-dayes, were rather against dayes dedicated to Saints, or against the prophane and superstitious obseruation of Christmas, which we call Zule; or serued to maintaine the order taken by the Church for the same, as shall bee made manifest in the particulars alledged by you.
               
               
                  PP.
                  In the generall Assembly holden at Edinburgh, Anno 1566. the latter Confession of Heluetia was approoued, but with speciall exception against some Holy-dayes dedicated to Christ: These same very dayes that now are vrged.
               
               
                  ANS.
                  By this exception the Assembly did not condemne the iudgement, and practise of the Heluetian Church as vnlawfull, superstitious or prophane: but onely declared, that by their approbation, they did nothing preiudiciall to the order and policie of their owne Church.
               
               
                  PP.
                  At the Assembly holden Anno 1575. complaint was made against the Ministers, and Readers beside Abirdene, because they assembled the people to Prayer and Preaching vpon certaine Patrone and Feastiuall dayes.
               
               
                  ANS.
                  This complaint was made for the contempt, and breach of the order of the Church, and the offence which people might take thereat; not for the religious Exercise vsed at the time.
               
               
                  PP.
                  Complaint likewise was ordained to be made to the Regent, vpon the Towne of Drumfreis, for vrging and conueying a Reader to the Church with Tabret and Whissell, to reade the Prayers all the Holy-dayes of Zule or Christmas, vpon refusall of their owne Reader.
               
               
                  ANS.
                  This was a iust complaint, because the Fact was not onely contrarious to the order of the Church, but superstitious, and prophane also in it selfe.
               
               
                  
                  PP.
                  
                     Item, An Article was formed to be presented to the Regent, crauing that all dayes heretofore kept holy in time of Papistrie, beside the Lords day, such as Zule day, Saints dayes, and other like Feasts, might be abolished, and a ciuill penaltie appointed against the obseruers of the said dayes.
               
               
                  ANS.
                  In this Article, wee must vnderstand by Dayes, not the Time it selfe materially, for that cannot bee abolished: but the superstitious cessation from labour on these dayes, with an opinion of necessitie, and the profane excesses of banquetting, playing, &c. which the Act of Perth hath also condemned.
               
               
                  PP.
                  In the Assembly holden in April, Anno 1577. it was ordayned, That the Visitor with the aduice of the Synodall Assembly, should admonish Ministers preaching, or ministring the Communion at Pasche, Zule, or other like superstitious times, or Readers reading, to desist vnder the paine of depriuation.
               
               
                  ANS.
                  This Ordinance was made to withdraw people from the superstitious opinion they had of these times, as is manifest by the wordes, Or other like superstitious times: and this, our Pastors are also ordayned still to rebuke.
               
               
                  PP.
                  Dedicating of Dayes was abjured in the Confession of Faith, penned, Anno 1580. an Article was formed in the Assembly 1581. crauing an Act of Parliament to bee made against the obseruation of feast-dayes dedicated to Saints, and setting out of Bone-fires.
               
               
                  ANS.
                  The dedicating of dayes abiured in the confession is in these words: We abiure his (to wit the Popes) canonization of men, calling vpon Angels, or Saints departed, worshipping of imagery, reliques, and crosse; dedicating of Churches, Altars,

Dayes, Vowes to creatures, &c. What is here? dayes dedicated by the Pope are ab
                        •
                     ured; but the fiue dayes concluded by the Church to be kept were not dedicated by the Pope, but obserued long before his vsurped authoritie aboue the Church: Neither are they obserued in the reformed Churches, or ordayned to be obserued in ours, according to the intention of the Papall dedication of dayes, that is, as Bellarmine sayes, tanquam sanctiores, & sacratiores alijs diebus, & tanquam pars diuini cultus, as more holy, and sacred, then other dayes, and a part of diuine worship: but onely as fit circumstances for the worship of God, appointed to be done vpon them, ordinis & politias causa, for order, and policie. Further, by the words of the Confession, and by the Article formed Anno 1581. it is manifest, that the dayes abiured are the dayes dedicated to creatures; but our dayes are dedicated to Christ, and therefore not abiured.
               
               
                  PP.
                  In the Assembly holden in February, Anno 1587. it was humbly moued to his Maiestie, that Pasche, and Zule were superstitiously obserued in Fife, and about Drumfreis.
                  
               
               
                  ANS.
                  So would we complaine, if any of these dayes were superstitiously obserued: for by the act of Perth it is ordayned, that Pastors in their Sermons vpon these dayes should rebuke the superstitious obseruation, and licentious profanation thereof.
               
               
                  PP.
                  In the Assembly holden 1590. his Maistie in open audience of the Assembly praised God, for that he was borne to bee a King in the syncerest Church in the World: syncerer then our neighbour Church of England, syncerer then Geneua it selfe, for they obserued Pasche and Zule.

                     atrie breaking forth in keeping of festiuall dayes, setting out of Bone-fires, and singing of Carrols are reckoned amongst the corruptions, which were to be amended. The Pulpits haue sounded continually against all festiuall dayes. The censures of the Church haue beene put in execution in all due forme against the obseruers.
               
               
                  ANS.
                  Yet the commemoration of the inestimable benefits of our redemption vpon these fiue dayes, was not reckoned amongst the corruptions to be amended. Neither did Pulpits

sound, nor were censures put in execution against preaching, prayers, and other holy exercises in these dayes: for, at that time, the Preachers gaue all obedience to the acts of the Church made concerning these things. But doe yee not see, by the regraite made at this Assembly, and by the acts, complaints, and ordinances by your selfe rehearsed, that the abstayning from preaching, and reading at these times, hath not remoued from people their superstitious opinions of the times, nor yet abolished the enormities, and abuses committed in them? Certainly, nothing is so powerfull to abolish prophanenesse, and roote out superstition of mens hearts, as the exercise of diuine worship in preaching, praying, and thanksgiuing, chiefly then, when the superstitious conceits of merit, and necessitie are most pregnant in the heads of people, as doubtlesse they are, when the set times of these solemnities returne: for then it is meetest to lance the oposteme, when it is ripe. Vpon these and such other reasons, it pleased his Maiestie to require, and our Church to condescend, that commemoration of the benefits purchased to vs by the Natiuitie, Death, Resurrection, and Ascension of our Sauiour, should be made solemnely on these dayes according to the practise of all other reformed Churches. And there is no question, the errours of the multitude, shall hereby, bee farre more easily remoued, then by any prohibition, that can be made to the contrary; and therewithall the people better instructed in the principall grounds of Religion, then they could by occasionall Doctrine: as also, the honour of God more highly aduanced, for wee know, that ordinary seruices are performed with lesse regard, and more coldly, then these which come more rarely to bee celebrated. Of all these, the hope is the greater, that now (wee owe it to our King, vnder God) the Churches are planted with able and sufficient Pastors, meete to discharge these duties. So by the Assembly at Perth there is nothing concluded either contrarious to any former constitution of the Church, or to any sound Doctrine, deliuered from Pulpits in former times.

And in the same Epistle, hee affirmes, that it is most insolent madnesse to doubt, if that should bee obserued, which the Church vniuersally keepes. Similiter etiam si quid horum tota per orbem frequentat Ecclesia▪ nam hoc quin ita faciendum sit, disputare, insolentissimae insaniae est. This conclusion of the Church his Maiesties pleasure was to ratifie by Act of Councell, and command cessation from labour vpon these fiue dayes, to the end, the holy Exercises appointed to be done thereon might be the better attended.

Hooker intreating this Argument, entitules the subiect, Festiuall dayes. He makes festiuall solemnities to be nothing else, but the due mixture, as it were, of these three elements:

Prayses set forth with chearfull alacritie of minde: Delight expressed by charitable largenesse, more then common bountie; and sequestration from ordinary labours. By these descriptions wee may see, that the Sabbath day is not properly a festiuall day. The ordinary Sabbath is weekely: The festiuall is Anniuersary. Wee may fast vpon the ordinary Sabbath, but wee cannot fast and mourne vpon a festiuall day, &c. Vpon the ordinary Sabbath all the parts of Gods worship may bee performed: Vpon festiuall dayes proper Texts, Epistles, Gospels, Homilies, and Sermons, are framed for the mysterie of that day. So that the ordinary Sabbath is morall, and for the worship of God in generall, the festiuall is mysticall. Essentialia festi; the essentiall parts of a festiuall day are cessation from worke, hearing of the Word, participation of the Sacraments: commemoration of diuine mysteries may be performed vpon the ordinary Sabbath, but to make vp a festiuall day, Bellarmine requires a determination of day, signification, and representation of the mysteries wrought on such dayes.

                  The description made by Piscator, is proper onely to the festiuall dayes prescribed in Gods Word. Hookers is more large, and may bee applyed to the Ecclesiasticall Festiuities. The Iewish Sabbath, according to these descriptions, is not properly festiuall, yet the Lords day was esteemed such by the primitiue Church and ancient Diuines, who held it not lawfull for Christians to fast thereon. Proper Texts, Epistles, Gospels, &c. are not to bee framed for the mysterie of the festiuall day, as yee say, but for the benefit and diuine action appointed to be remembred thereon. If by the ordinary Sabbath yee vnderstand the Iewish Sabbath, it was not onely morall, but mysticall, as their festiuall dayes were: and if by festiuall dayes yee vnderstand the dayes obserued in the Christian Orthodoxe Church, we deny them to be mysticall. If by essentialia festi, yee vnderstand the essentiall parts of the worship performed on the festiuall day, wee deny cessation

from worke to be an essentiall part of the worship, but only concomitant and consequent thereto, because it cannot be commodiously performed without cessation from other businesse. As to Bellarmines opinion, himselfe professes, that it is contrarie to the iudgement of our Diuines. For they hold, as wee doe, that our Festiuall dayes are not obserued for signification and representation of our mysteries, or memorable workes wrought on these dayes, or as a part of diuine worship; but for order and policie, as meete and commodious circumstances for commemoration of the workes and benefits of God thereon, Bellar. de cultu Sanctor. l. 3. c. 10.

                     Six dayes shalt thou labour, and doe all that thou hast to doe. These words are either a command to doe the workes of our calling, as many both Iewish and Christian Diuines doe interpret: or else a permission, as others doe interpret: If they contayne a command, no countermand may take it away. If a permission, no humane authority may spoyle men of the libertie, that God hath granted vnto them, as long as they haue any manner of worke to doe, for the sustentation of this life. The Muscouites therefore say very well, that it is for Lords to keepe Feasts, and abstaine from labour. The Citizens and Artificers amongst them vpon the Festiuall dayes, after diuine Seruice to betake themselues to their labor and domestick affaires, as Gaguinus reports.

                  Whether the words of the command, bee preceptine, or permissiue, I will neither curiously, nor contentiously dispute, but it seemes, they are not preceptiue; for if wee were commanded to spend the whole sixe dayes in seruile labour, then times could not bee lawfully appointed for publike Prayers in Cities at morne & at euening: nor ordinary times for preaching on the weeke dayes, or for exercise, or for catechizing; nor times for fasting vpon vrgent occasions without sinne, and breach of the Precept. Next the precept

                     
                        〈1 page〉
                     
                     
to the order taken by Superiours for publike actions, that by a mutuall harmonie, the weale of the whole bodie both temporall and spirituall may be procured. Otherwise if by this permission the libertie were granted to euery person, which you imagine, to attend his own businesse without respect of order, or subiection to policie, there could be nothing but confusion amongst men. The generall libertie granted to men touching the vse of times, meats, clothing, talking, sleeping, watching, &c. takes not away the power of Ciuil & Ecclesiastick Gouernors, to set down Constitutions & Canons touching the Dispensation of these things for the weale of the Countrey. Neither doe the Lawes and Ordinances touching this Dispensation spoyle men of their libertie, but directs them how to vse it profitably and well. The Act therefore of Councell and Proclamation made thereupon, commanding cessation and abstinence from all handie-worke vpon the fiue dayes, that euery one may the better attend the holy exercises appointed for these times, cannot bee called a spoliation of the libertie which God hath giuen to men for labour; seeing, as hath beene said, that libertie is not absolute, but subiect vnto order. Moreouer, if we consider the matter it selfe, this which yee say, will appeare to be a manifest calumnie: For, if vnder the Law, God did not spoyle his people of libertie, when hee appointed them to rest two dayes at Pasche, one at Whitsonday, one at the Feast of Trumpets, one at the Feast of Expiation, and two at the Feast of Tabernacles; how can the Kings Maiestie and the Church be esteemed to spoyle vs of our libertie, that command a cessation from labour vpon three dayes only throughout the whole yeere? for two of the dayes commanded, to wit, Easter, and Whitsonday, are Sondayes. Last of all, he cannot be said to bee spoyled properly, that makes a profitable interchange without any losse; but he that changes the exercises of the body, which are little worth, with the exercises of Pietie which is profitable to all things, makes a profitable change without losse: therefore hee who

makes this change according to the Proclamation, is not spoyled of his liberty, but maketh vantage by the right vse thereof.
                  Here it shall not bee amisse to recite Zanchius opinion in this purpose, who defending their opinion, that esteeme the words to contayne a command, moues a doubt, and answers it after this manner, Verùm enimuerò videtur cum hac sententia pugnare, &c. That is, But this fights against their opinion, that hold the words to be a command, that it was euer lawfull to Gods people to assemble themselues on other dayes beside the Sabbath, to heare Gods Word, to bee present at Prayers, to offer Sacrifices, and such other things belonging to outward worship, which farre lesse can bee denyed to vs: and therefore beside the Lords Day, other dayes are instituted in the Church, ad feriandum ab operibus seruilibus: to rest from seruile workes, if not for the whole day, yet for the morning time. He answeres, Facilis est horum conciliatio: sicut opera diuini cultus praeponenda sunt operibus seruilibus, ita haec sunt omittenda, quando illis vacandum est, &c. that is, These things may be easily reconciled: as the workes of Gods worship are to bee preferred to seruile workes, so these must be omitted, when those are to bee performed. And a little after, We sinne not against this precept, sayes hee, when wee ceasse from our seruile labour, to waite on Gods worship, quoties ordo Ecclesiae, aut necessitas postulat, so often, as the order of the Church, and necessitie requires. This is Zanchius iudgement vpon the fourth precept of the Law, in the sixe hundred sixty two page of that Worke. And if a precept cannot impede the appointing of solemne times for the worship of God, farre lesse can a permission.
                  The Muscouites saying, that it is for Lords to make Feasts, and abstaine from labour, is true: yet amongst them Festiuall Dayes are obserued. That the Citizens after diuine Seruice on these Dayes, betake themselues to their labour, wee doe not reproue, because it is agreeable to their policie.

                  It may be obiected, that Constantine the Emperour made a Law, that none but the Prince may ferias condere, erect an idle day: The Prince then may enioyne a day of cessation. Answ. The Lawes of the Cod. are not Rules of Theologie; A Prince may not enioyne cessation from Oeconomicall and Domesticke workes, but for weapon-shewing, exercise of Armes, defence of the Countrey, or other publike workes and affaires. But that is not to enioyne a day of simple cessation, but to enioyne a politicke worke in place of the Oeconomicall.

                  Though the Lawes of the Cod. bee not Rules of Theologie, yet where they are not contrary to Scripture, they are good Rules of Gouernment to Princes, and of obedience to Subiects. That the Prince may enioyne a day of cessation from seruile worke for the worship of God, is not only not contrary, but most agreeable to Scripture. The Festiuall Dayes of Purim kept by the Iewes, were confirmed by the Decree of Queene Esther, Esth. 9.32. It is written in the Booke of Ionah, the third Chapter and seuenth verse: That ye the Decree of the King of Niniue, and his Nobles, a Fast was proclamed. The Feast of Dedication, graced with the presence of our Sauiour, was instituted by Indas Machabaeus and the people, 1. Mach. 10. And if the King may command a cessation from Oeconomicall and priuate workes, for workes ciuill and publike, such as the defence of the Crowne, the liberty of the Countrey, &c. What reason haue yee, why hee may not enioyne a day of cessation from all kind of bodily labour, for the honour of God, and exercise of Religion?

When yee discussed the oath, yee cited the ordinances of this Booke, as poynts of Discipline sworne vnto, and subscribed. If it bee not lawfull to commaund, and compell a man to goe to diuine Seruice, except vpon the Lords day, why did yee sweare in the assertorie oath, that it was lawfull? But yee will say, I sware not that he might be compelled: but if he may be lawfully commanded to cease from his labour, during the time of diuine seruice, he may be as lawfully compelled to obey the cōmand. Necessitie, ye know, excuses the breach of the Sabboth it selfe. But the precepts of this Booke, ye vse, or vse not, as they may serue to your purpose.

                  Dayes are sanctified, and made holy, as are places, two manner of wayes: some places were made holy, by annexing to them a peculiar worship instituted by God, which lawfully could not be performed in another place: such were the Tabernacle, and the Temple, which were also holy, by reason of the typicke and mysticall signification wherewith they were clothed by diuine institution. These places did appertaine to the worship, not as mere circumstances onely, but as essentiall parts and properties thereof.

Yet our act in the beginning sayes, Wee abhorre the superstitious obseruation of the Festiuall dayes of the Papists. Thus we professe our disagreement from them in this poynt, which they also acknowledge. Bellarmine in the tenth Chapter of his third Booke De cultu Sanctorum, rehearses the Doctrine of Luther, and Caluine, (to which wee adhere) and reproues the same as erronious in these wordes: Tertiò, docent dies determinatos ad feriandum, non debere haberi caeteris sanctiores, quasi mysterij aliquid, vel piam significationem continerent: sed solum haberi tanquam determinatos, Disciplinae, & ordinis, ac politiae causa, ita, vt cum hac determinatione,

etiam consistat, aequalit as dierum, & in hoc nos accusont, quasi habeamus discrimen dierum Iudaico more. He sayes, that we teach the dayes appoynted for holy exercises, not to bee holier then others, or to be esteemed, as if they contayned any mysterie, or diuine signification, but onely as determined for discipline, order, and policie, with which determination, the qualitie of dayes may consist. And hee sayes, that we accuse them, for putting difference amongst dayes after the Iewish manner, which is the doctrine indeed of our best Diuines. Against this Bellarmine

This is the Papists opinion, which wee with all the reformed Churches abhorre, as superstitious and idolatrous. But yee take part with Bellarmine against the Doctrine of Luther, and Caluine, labouring to prooue, that the reformed Churches obserue these dayes not onely for discipline, order, and policie, but for memoriall signes of sacred mysteries as Papists doe.

                  It follows not of this, that we obserue the dayes for signes of sacred mysteries, because they put vs not in minde of Christs birth, passion, &c. as ceremonies significant, or sacramentall signes instituted by God, or the Church for that effect: but as circumstances onely determined for celebration of the religious action, whereby the commemoration of these benefits is made. And there is nothing more vsuall, then by considering the circumstances of times, places, and

persons, to remember the actions and businesse whereunto they are destinate.

                  This is manifestly false, for the Lords Day is commaunded to be obserued of necessitie for conscience of the diuine Ordinance, as a day sanctified, and blessed by God himselfe: These are commanded to be obserued onely for ecclesiasticall order, and policie, and doe not oblige men in conscience to obedience, but for eschewing scandall, and contempt. Secondly, the Lords Day is to be obserued, as the Sabbath of IEHOVAH, that is, not onely for a day, wherein we are appointed to rest to God, but as a day whereon God himselfe did rest, after the Creation: So it is obserued as a remembrance, and resemblance of Gods rest. Thirdly, the Lords Day is obserued as is the Lords Supper; this, in remembrance of his death; that, in remembrance of his resurrection. Fourthly, the Lords Day is obserued as a pledge of that rest, wherein hee that enters, shall rest from his labours, as God hath done from his. And fiftly, we obserue the Lords Day, as a perpetuall signe betweene God and vs, to signifie and declare that the God, who hath sanctified vs to be his people, and whom wee adore, as IEHOVAH the Father, who created the World in sixe dayes, and rested the seuenth: IEHOVAH the Sonne, who redeemed the World, and rising that day to life, abolished sinne and death, and brought life and immortalitie to light; and IEHOVAH the Holy Ghost, who on that day descended vpon the Twelue Apostles, sanctifying them, and the whole World by them, with the truth of Gods Word. In none of these fiue poynts, doe we obserue the Festiuall dayes as the Lords Day.

But vpon this, yee will neuer conclude, that these dayes, which yee falsly call mysticall, doe not onely equall, but surpasse the morall Sabbath in solemnitie; for the whole solemnitie hath onely respect to the benefits, which on these times are remembred, and no respect at all to the Time: The solemnitie not being obserued for the Time, but the Time for the solemne remembrance of these benefits. The Lords Day otherwise is not onely obserued for the diuine seruice that is performed thereon, but the same seruice and publike worship, which may bee omitted on all the sixe dayes, must be performed on the Lords Day, because God hath appointed it to be sanctified with these holy Exercises.

                  If they were instituted onely for order and policie, that the people may assemble to religious exercises; wherefore is there but one day appointed betwixt the Passion and the Resurrection? Wherefore fortie dayes betweene the Resurrection and Ascension, and ten betweene the Ascension and the Pentecost? Why follow we the course of the Moone as

the Iewes did, in our moueable feasts, making the Christian Church clothed with the Sunne, to walke vnder the Moone, as Bonauentura alludes? Wherefore is there not a certayne day of the Moneth kept for Easter, aswell as for the Natiuitie? Does not Bellarmine giue this reason out of Augustine, that the day of Natiuitie is celebrated onely for memorie, the other both for memorie and for Sacraments?

                  Saint Augustines opinion alleadged by Bellarmine,
                     
                        Epist. 119. is not receiued by the reformed Churches, as the reason moouing them to obserue these times: for they expresly deny, that they keepe these times for any mysterie or Sacrament that is in them, but onely for order and policie, which directeth all things to bee done to edification, and allowes vs to make choyce of such circumstances, as are most meet to promoue the spirituall businesse, whereunto they are applyed. And this is a kinde of Christian prudence and dexteritie, for who knowes not what moment there is in the opportunity of Times and Places to aduance actions? Now, because no times can be found more conuenient for a solemne commemoration of the Birth, Passion, &c. then these, which are either he same indeed by reuolution, or in cōmon estimation; they follow in this the iudgement of the primitiue Church, esteeming it pietie to prefer vnitie with the Catholike church in things indifferent and lawfull, to the singularitie of any priuate mans opinion, or the practice of any particular Church. The allegation of Bonauentura his allusion in such a graue point is ridiculous; for if the Sunne and the Moone bee taken mystically, as they are in the Reuelation, in this case the Church clothed with the Sunne, that is, with the light of the Gospell, walkes not vnder the Moone, that is, according to the opinions and fashions of the world; but treading these vnder foote, followes the rules of order and decency for edification.

                  I answere, Although the circumstance of Time, whereon the Anniuersary commemoration is made, differs not in holinesse, or any mysticke signification from the weekly dayes of preaching, yet it differres in frequency and raritie, for the dayes of weekely preaching doe returne; and to astrict the Husband-man to leaue his plough so often, were against equitie and charitie.▪ but the times of these commemorations being so rare, to wit, three seruile dayes onely in the yeare, and the exercise so profitable, Reason would, if the Husband-man willingly did not leaue his plough at these times, that by authoritie he should be forced, aswell for his owne benefit, as for eschuing scandall and contempt. And Master Galloway had reason to curse these, who for contempt, and with offence of their Brethren absented themselues from the Sermons of Christs Natiuitie. Lastly, the difference of the seruice on these dayes, from the weekely and ordinary, makes them not to differ in holinesse or mysterie from the weekely dayes, more then the difference in seruice, which is performed on the fift of August, and fift of Nouember, makes these two dayes to bee mysticke, or more holy then other times.

                  To make solemne commemoration of Christs Natiuitie, vpon any other day then vpon the putatiue day of his Natiuitie, would be thought a great absurditie.

                  If yee haue not fallen into this absurditie, yee must grant,

that yee neuer made in your time any solemne commemoration of Christs Natiuitie. And, I verily beleeue, that in this omission yee haue many companions; by whose negligence God hath beene defrauded of the honour due to him for this benefit, and the people lacked instruction in a principall Article of Faith. This Article is the ground of all the rest: for as Chrysostome sayes, If our Sauiour had not beene borne, he had neither suffered, nor risen againe from the dead; and thereupon he calls the day of this commemoration, Metropolim omnium Festorum. Euen for this it was expedient, that a certayne time of the yeare should haue beene appointed for this commemoration, which otherwise would haue been neglected, and, as yee say, thought absurd.
                  But to returne to your Argument, The commemoration of Christs Natiuity, is no more astricted to the 25. of December, then to any other time: for although the 25. of December, by ordinance of the Church, bee dedicated to that religious seruice, yet the seruice is not astricted to the time, as the seruice of the Iewish festiuities, which lawfully might not be performed on any other dayes then the festiuall. The commemoration appointed by our Church to bee made on these fiue dayes, may lawfully be performed at other conuenient times, although on these dayes the same must not bee omitted. For the seruice, ar I haue said, is not appointed for the Time, but the Time is appointed for the worship. So it is not absurd to remember Christs Natiuitie so oft as occasion is offered with all conuenient solemnitie, as it may serue to his honour, and the edification of the Church. Thus wee haue seene, that according to the Doctrine of the reformed Churches, Anniuersarie dayes are and may bee obserued, though not for any mysterie or holinesse that is in them, more then in other dayes, but for order and policy onely. Against this, all the Reasons, which Bellarmine or yee haue brought, or can inuent, shall neuer preuaile more, then the barking of a dogge, against the Moone.

                     tie to make, or ordayne a thing to bee holy, how may the Church make a thing holy by appointing an occasionall feast, or fast, as yee grant shee may doe? The instinct of nature, and that command out of Ioel, is a generall warrant onely: The particular calamitie or benefit, wherefore a fast, or feast should be proclaymed, is not expressed, neither is the time particularly determined, whereupon the solemne festiuitie, or fast, should be kept, but the one is left to the estimation, and the other, to the determination of the Church. So by that warrant, libertie is giuen to the Church to consider, and define the causes, for the which a fast should bee proclaymed, and to determine the time, when the same should be obserued; and to separate that time from common businesse, and consecrate the same to the spirituall exercise of preaching, hearing, praying, fasting, &c. as our Church hath vsed to doe very often. Now, if the Church hath power vpon occasionall motiues

to appoint occasionall fasts, or festiuities, may not shee for constant, and eternall blessings, which doe infinitely excell all occasionall benefits, appoint ordinary times of commemoration, and thanksgiuing? Ye say that this hath no warrant, but yee speake without warrant: for there is as great warrant to appoint such dayes, as is for any other point of Ecclesiasticall policie, touching the determination of times, places, formes, and order to be obserued in the worship of God, according to these generall g

The whole policie of our Church touching the vse of these circumstantiall things is ordered by these rules, and according to these did our Church in the first booke of Discipline which yee cite often, ordayne for the purpose now in hand, That in euery notable Towne a day beside the Sonday should bee appointed weekely for Sermon: that during the time of Sermon the day should be kept free from all exercise of labour, as well by the Master, as by the seruant. That euery day, there be either Sermon, or prayers, with reading of the Scriptures. That Baptisme be orderly ministred, either on the Sonday, or after Sermon, and the dayes of prayer. That at foure seuerall times of the yeere, the Sacrament of the Lords Supper be ministred. viz. on the first Sonday of March, on the first Sonday of Iune, first Sonday of September, and the first Sonday of December. That in euery towne where Schollers are, and learned men repaire, a certaine day euery weeke be appointed for the exercise of Ministers in prophecie. And the said booke affirmes, The dedication of times, and houres for such generall and particular exercises of the Word, and Sacraments, and Prayer, to appertayne to the policie of the Church. If the Church hath power after this manner to appoint times for Doctrine, and diuine Seruice, and Doctrine, and diuine Seruice for times, as the doctrine of the Catechisme on Sonday at afternoone, (reade the 9. Chapter of the said booke) it cannot be denyed, but the Church hath also power to appoint

a certaine time, day, and houre, for commemoration of Christs Natiuitie, Passion, &c. For what more power had our Church at that time to appoint the Sacrament to be ministred the first Sondaies of March, Iune, &c. then she hath now to appoint a Sermon to be made of Christs resurrection vpon Easter day, and a Sermon of the sending downe of the holy Ghost vpon Whitsunday? and does not the light of Nature teach vs, that rare and great benefits, should be remembred with more then ordinary thankefulnesse? Hereby it is cleere, that it is not the Lords soueraignty onely to make or ordayne a thing to be holy, but it is a prerogatiue, that God also hath giuen to the Christian Church. But to the end, this matter may be fully cleered, it is to be obserued, as we said before, that times are made holy, and places two manner of wayes; so things are made holy, either by some inherent qualitie of holynesse, or by consecration of them to holy vses. After the first manner Angels and men were made holy in the creation, sinners are made holy by regeneration, and sanctification of the holy Ghost; and of this holynesse, God onely is the author. Next, things are made holy by consecration of them to holy vses, which vses are either mysticall or politicall. The consecration of things to holy mysticall vses, as of water in Baptisme to be a signe of the bloud, and Spirit of Christ; the elements of Bread and Wine in the Supper to be the Sacrament of his Bodie and Bloud; the Sabbath to bee vnto the Iewes a memoriall of the Creation, a type of signification, and a badge of their profession; the Temple, the Altars, the Sacrifices, and Priests, to bee shaddowes of things to come: all these, and such like are made, and ordayned holy by God; but the consecration of things to holy vses for policie, as for maintayning religion, or for order, and decency to be obserued in the worship of God, is not onely Gods prerogatiue, but a priuiledge, and liberty granted by him to the Church; for example, to build, and consecrate places to be Temples, houses to bee Hospitals; to giue rent, lands, money, and goods

to the Ministry & poore; to appoint Vessels, Vestures, & Instruments for the publike worship, as Tables▪ Table-clothes, Napkins, Basens, Cups, and Lauers for the holy Sacraments, these things and the like are made holy by the dedication and consecration of men. After this last manner, the Church hath power to consecrate the fiue Anniuersary dayes to the commemoration of our Sauiour his benefits, to separate them from all other ordinary workes, and so to make them sacred and holy dayes. It was I grant a part of Idolatry to proclaime a holy day vnto the golden Calfe, or to any Idol, or Creature, as ye affirme; but it will not follow that it is Idolatry to proclaime a holy day, for the honour and worship of the true God. And as it was one of Ieroboams sins, to despise the Festiuities appointed by God for his worship, and instead of these to ordaine a Feast after the deuise of his owne heart, so if we should despise the Lords Sabbath, and instead thereof appoint some other, as the Machomet hath done, it were a presumptuous sinne. But this wee are farre from, acknowledging the Lords Day to bee holy by his institution, and appointing the rest to bee kept only for his worship.

                  Againe, where yee say, that these dayes had more then humane warrant, because it is thought that Mordecai was the Penman of the Booke of Esther, and consequently, a Prophet; and that it appeares that these dayes might not haue beene altered by the Iewish Church, which if they had bin of Ecclesiasticke Constitution, might haue bin done: thoughts, and appearances, are not sure probations to conclude a certaintie as yee doe, of a more then humane warrant. And if they had receiued from God, any particular direction concerning them, the Prophet of God would not haue omitted the same in the Historie. A generall warrant they had, such as the Church must haue for the determination of circumstances in the worship of God, as that of the hundred and fifth Psalme, Giue thankes to the Lord, call on his Name, make knowne his deeds amongst the people. Sing vnto him, sing Psalmes vnto him, talke of all his wondrous workes that he hath done. But to say, that they had any particular warrant, is to be wise aboue that which is written.

                     e was an addition of the Pharisies, who inlarged the glory of this Feast, as they did their Phylacteries; but this is a friuolous coniecture, and the interpretation of Iunius words out of the Talmude is no better, to wit, that the Wisemen who decreed that the eighth dayes of that Feast should bee yeerely dayes of ioy, were the Pharisies, because they are called Sapientes Israelis; for it behoued these that appointed the Festiuities not onely to bee Wisemen, but men of Authoritie

also: And therefore it is more probable, that the Wisemen in the Talmude were the Masters of the great Synagogue, that had power to appoint such Festiuities. But how would our Sauiour, who censured the Pharisies for inlarging their Phylacteries, and corrected the abuses of the Law, brought in by them, haue omitted such a grosse Errour and Superstition, as the Institution and keeping of these holy dayes vnrebuked, if it had beene a Pharisaicall Addition, and not a lawfull Constitution? Then yee teach your Reader a great cunning to play fast and loose, in answering all the instances brought from the Iewish Church: and that is, whether hee grant, or denie them to bee lawfull, yet to eschew the dint of the Argument; for if hee grant them to bee lawfull, then he may flye to this refuge, that the Iewes had extraordinarie directions which wee want; as Prophets who were only Prophets by the Spirit vnto the dayes of Malachie; Vrim and Thummim vnder the first Temple, and in place thereof vnder the second, a slender voyce sounding from Heauen, called Bathcoll. But if hee denie the same to haue beene lawfull, then to alleadge that they were Pharisaicall Additions, and that wee should not imitate the Pharisies and fond Iewes. I assure my selfe, that no honest-hearted man will either follow the Pharisies in their Superstition, nor you in vsing such sophisticall euasions, of which, none will serue against the instances alledged: for if yee say, that the obseruation of the dayes of Pur
                           •
                        m, or Dedication, were Pharisaicall Additions, the exact diligence of our Sauiour in rebuking and correcting all such abuses and superstitious Nouations, as were brought into the worship of God by the Pharisies, will controll you: And if ye say, that they had extraordinarie directions, yee speake without warrant of Scripture, which is presumption in you to doe. So it remaines for any thing ye haue said, that holy dayes were, and might bee lawfully kept, vnder the Law without any particular warrant from God. But put the case, that the same might not haue beene done vnder the Law, it

followes not, that the Christian Church hath not libertie to appoint dayes, and times for religious exercises without particular direction. For vnder the Law, God not only set downe the substance of his worship, but all the circumstances also, as the persons in particular by whom, the place where, and the times when he should be worshipped, so fully, as little, or nothing was left to the abitrement of the Iewish Church; and as yee say, these times were so ceremonious, that the greatest part of the externall worship consisted in Ceremonies: vnder the Gospell it is not so, for in the Gospell, the substance of these Ceremonies, and of the worship of God is perfectly set downe; but the circumstantiall Ceremonies of time, place, persons, and formes, which are no part of the worship, but pertinences only, are left to bee determined by the Church according to the generall Rules of Order and Decencie. It is true, because the Iewes had one place only appointed by God, for his worship, to wit, the Temple and Tabernacle, whereunto the people could not resort at all times, therefore to their owne election, was permitted the appointing of other commodious places for their Synagogues. And now vnder the Gospell, there is one onely Day of diuine Institution, to wit, the Lords Day, whereunto to tye the worship of God, is a Iudaicall Pedagogie against the Christian libertie and practice. For the time is now come, that from one new Moone to another, and from one Sabbath to another, all flesh shall come and worship before God, Isa. 66.23. According to the which Prophesie, the Apostolike and Primitiue Church did not only conuene on the Lords Day to worship God▪ but on such other times, as they thought commodious to obserue. Saint Paul taught often on the Iewish Sabbath, and at Ephesus daily for the space of two yeares, in the Schoole of one Tyrannus. Saint Augustine testifies, that in some Churches they conuened daily, not onely to preaching, praying, and Lectures, but to the celebration of the Sacrament also. Epiphanius in his Epitomie, or Abridgement of Christian Faith, affirmeth, Apostolos instituisse synaxes,

                     , that is, The Apostles to haue instituted their holy meetings for diuine Seruice on Wednesday, Friday, and the Lords Day. So

                     , the holy mysteries were celebrated. Hereby it is manifest, albeit the Church was tyed to worship God solemnly and publikely on the Lords Day, that yet they were not tyed to that Day only, but that all dayes we

And such are the fiue dayes of old obserued by the Primitiue Church, and now restored againe in our Church: and such were the dayes of Purim, and the Feast of Dedication, which were not obserued as a part of religion instituted by God, but only for commemoration of Gods benefits bestowed vpon his people in these times.

                        The fourth Reason.
                     The obseruation of Anniuersary dayes pertayned to the Ceremoniall Law: but so it is, that the Ceremoniall Law is abolished. Ye confirme the Antecedent, by the reasons following.
                  First, The Anniuersary Dayes were distinguished from the Morall Sabbath: many were the preheminences of the ordinary Sabbath aboue the Anniuersary dayes.
                  Secondly, The Apostle cals them weake, & beggerly rudiments, Gal. 4.9.10. The elements of the world, Col. 2.20. Shaddowes

of things to come, Col. 2.16, 17. The Apostle sayes not the obseruation of Iudaicall dayes, but, simpliciter, the obseruation of dayes serued to the people of God for a typicall vse and rudiment of Religion. If the obseruation of some anniuersarie dayes was prescribed to the Iewes, as elements and rudiments for their instruction: it followes, that the obseruation of anniuersarie dayes is of it selfe a rudimentarie instruction: Otherwise, the Apostles reason will not hold.
                  Thirdly, Dayes and Meates are paralelled: therefore, as it is Iudaicall to esteeme some meates cleane, and some vnclean, so to esteeme one day holier then another, is Iudaicall.
                  Fourthly, To substitute other dayes in place of the Iewish, as a Christian Pasche, and Whitsonday for the Iewish, is to substitute rudiments to the Iewish, and not to chase them away.
                  Fiftly, The Iewish anniuersarie dayes were not onely abrogated as shaddowes of things to come, but as memorials of by gone benefits. In euery respect, all their anniuersarie daies are abolished: Therefore in euery respect, they belong to the Ceremoniall Law.
               
               
                  ANS.
                  These arguments yee vse, to prooue the obseruation of anniuersarie dayes to be ceremoniall. I answer them one by one. First, where yee say, that anniuersarie dayes in the Law were distinguished from the morall Sabbath, if ye will of this conclude, that the anniuersarie dayes were not morall, but typicall, I will not deny it. But if yee conclude, anniuersarie daies to be therefore simply ceremoniall, I say it followes not, and that your argument is a caption à dicto secundum quid, ad dictum simplicitèr. The obseruation of a weekely day, amongst the Iewes, was not onely morall, but a typicall shadow of things to come: Is the Lords Day then, because it is weekely, not onely morall, but also typicall? But, perhaps, ye reason thus: Anniuersarie dayes are eyther ceremoniall, or morall; but so it is, they are not morall, ergo.
                     
To this I say, that your diuision is not full nor perfect: for, there be anniuersarie dayes, that are naturall, as the Aequinoctiall, and Solstitiall: Others, that are ciuill, as dayes of Markets, and Weapon-shewings, &c. And there be dayes Ecclesiasticall, which are neyther morall, nor mysticall, but meerely circumstantiall to the worship whereunto they are appoynted.
                  To the second I answer, that anniuersarie dayes are not called by the Apostle, Elements, and Rudiments, otherwise then the New-Moones, which are monethly dayes, and Sabbaths which were weekely dayes: And therefore, if the Apos
                        •
                     le had called dayes, Shadowes, by reason of their yeerely reuolution, he could not haue concluded, that Sabbaths and New-moones were Shaddowes. It is neither the weekly, nor monethly, nor anniuersarie reuolution, that made these dayes ceremoniall; for then ciuill, and naturall, and all kinde of dayes should be ceremoniall; but it was the mysticall signification which they had, and the ceremoniall worship appropriated vnto them. That the Apostle forbiddeth the obseruation of these dayes, and not simpliciter of dayes, is manifest, both by that which goeth before, vers. 9. and that which followeth, vers. 21. The dayes whereof hee speakes, were Elements of the Law, from the which, that we might be deliuered, Christ was made vnder the Lawe: And the obseruation of these dayes, was a remayning still vnder the seruile yoake of the Law. But, there was neuer man before you, that did thinke the obseruation prohibited for any naturall respect, such as the yeerely, weekely, or monethly reuolution is; but onely for some legall consideration, or some heathenish superstition. And seeing for these respects onely, the religious obseruation of dayes is discharged, it is a caption ab accidenti to conclude, that the obseruation of anniuersarie dayes is forbidden.
                  I answer to the third, that to esteeme one day holier, then another, for any inherent holinesse they haue by nature, is superstitious; and to esteeme one day holier then another,

for any sacramentall holinesse, that they haue by diuine institution, is Iudaicall: but, for the vse whereunto the day is applied, as a meete and commodious circumstance, so to esteeme it is no more superstitious and Iudaicall, then to esteeme a Temple holier then a priuate house, and the instruments, vessels, and clothes that are vsed in the ministration of Sacraments, more holy then other common instruments and vessels. These we call holy, onely by reason of their separation from a common vse, to a religious. So this argument is a caption ab homonymia.
                  
                  I answer to the fourth, That one thing is properly said to be substitute to another, when it is applied to the same vse. Our Pasche, and Pentecost, are neyther applied to be memorials of the deliuerance out of Aegypt, nor testimonies of our thankfulnesse for the First-fruits of the earth, nor to be shaddowes of our spirituall deliuerie to come, and of the First-fruits of the Holy Ghost: neyther doe wee offer the Passeouer, nor the First-fruits, nor any legall sacrifice; and so in no respect are they substitute to these times: but they are dedicated to the commemoration of Christs resurrection, and the comming downe of the Holy Ghost, not as mysticall, and sacramentall ceremonies, and a part of the diuine worshippe, which the Papists esteeme them to be, but as they are fit and meete circumstancess onely for these holy exercises.
                  To the fift and last argument I answer, That the anniuersarie dayes of the Iewes are abolished in euerie respect, for which by them they were obserued, and so are the weekely and monethly daies: but, as the weekly and monthly course was not the respect for which the Sabbath and New-moons are abolished, no more is the anniuersarie reuolution of the feasts, the respect wherefore they were abrogate, but because they were shaddowes of things to come, and remembrances of temporall benefits, as of their deliuerie out of Aegypt, which was also typicall. And because they had a legall worship appropriated vnto them, which was likewise ceremoniall.

Now to conclude vpon this, that the obseruation of anniuersarie dayes vnder the Gospell, is abolished, is a caption, à non causa, pro causa: For the anniuersarie daies kept vnder the Gospell, are not obserued as any part of diuine worship, or as shaddowes of things to come, or as memoriall signes and Sacraments of by-past, temporall, and typicall benefits: but they are obserued as commodious circumstances for the worship appointed to be done on them, to wit, the commemoration of the inestimable benefits of our redemption, which are not temporall, and peculiar to any People, or Nation, such as the deliuerance of the Iewes out of Aegypt, and their dwelling in Tents, remembred by their Pasche, and their Feast of Tabernacles; but eternall, and common to all Nations, and People. Neither is the worship performed on them legall, and ceremoniall, but euangelicall and spirituall. Thus the obseruation is wholly different. The time is appointed to be obserued, not as a shadow, but as a circumstance onely: the w
                        •
                     rship is not the sacrificing of beasts, or oblation of First-fruits, but the Preaching of Christ, who is the body, the veritie, the yea, and amen, and end of the Lawe; and the Oblation of prayers, thankesgiuing, and praises in his name to the Father: and the benefits which are remembred are not temporall, and typicall, but eternall, and spirituall.

                  The prerogatiue belonging to God in the Old Testament, was transferred to Christ,

                      God and Man, the Law-giuer in the New-Testament, one that was faithfull in all the house of God. But so it is, that Christ neither by his owne commandement, nor by direction of his Spirit, inspiring the Apostles, instituted any other day, but the Lords Day, &c.
               
               
                  ANS.
                  The Theologie of your Preface or Proposition I vnderstand not. I learne in the Scripture that the Prerogatiue of the Father is communicated with the Son, and that all power in heauen and in earth is giuen to our Lord Iesus Christ.

But I neuer read that God hath made any translation, and denuded himselfe of any prerogatiue in the New Testament, that belonged to him before in the olde. That which ye subioyne, that Christ and his Spirit hath instituted no other day, but the Lords Day, we freely graunt: for if it were euident that the fiue dayes had beene instituted by Christ, then we behoued to obserue and esteeme them as necessary parts of Gods worship, and not circumstances determined by the Church, to the worship of God, for order and policie, which we hold with our best Diuines. And therefore wee say in the verie first wordes of our Act, Wee abhorre the superstitious obseruation of Festiuall dayes. This superstitious obseruation is nothing else but an obseruation of them with opinion of necessitie, that is, as necessarie parts of Gods worshippe instituted by Christ. So in this wee agree, yet I doe not allow of the reasons which yee vse, for probation hereof.
                  Your first argument is, If there had beene any other dayes dedicated to Christ, the Apostle spake vnproperly, and obscurely, when he said, Hee was rauished in the Spirit vpon the Lords Day. For if there had beene a day for his Natiuitie, and another for his Passion, he should haue said, that he was rauished in the Spirit vpon one of the Lords Dayes. This argument is friuolous. Although all the Festiuall dayes vnder the Law were dedicated to God, and were called Sabbaths, yea sometimes Sabbath Sabbathôn, yet none of them is called the Sabbath of IEHOVAH, or the Lords Sabbath; that is reserued to the seuenth day of the Weeke, and the seuenth Yeere, which resembled Gods rest: And although all the Synagogues were Houses dedicated to God, yet the Temple is not called one of Gods Houses, but the House of God; euen so, the Day of Christs resurrection 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , for the excellencie thereof, is called the Lords Day, albeit other times had beene appoynted for his honour.
                  
                     Your next Argument is false: in it, yee affirme, That the Apostle condemnes not onely the obseruation of Iewish dayes, and the Iewish obseruation of the Iewish dayes to a typicall vse: for the conuerted Iewes (yee say) did not obserue them as shadowes of things to come, for then they had denyed Christ: but he condemnes the obseruation of dayes as a Pedagogicall and rudimentarie instruction, not beseeming the Christian Church. But howbeit the conuerted Iewes did not obserue the Iewish dayes, as shadowes of things to come, yet they might haue obserued them as memorialls of by-past temporall, and typicall benefits, and for present temporall blessings, as the benefit of their deliuery out of Egypt, and for the Fruits of the earth, which vse was also typicall: Further, they did obserue them with opinion of necessitie, as things instituted by God for his worship, and their saluation, which sort of obseruation was Legall: but this proceeding from infirmitie, and for want of sufficient instruction, was not a denying of Christ, as it had beene, if the same had proceeded from pertinacy, after the knowledge of the Truth receiued. And this was it which the false Apostles vrged vpon the Galatians, and Saint Paul condemnes in that Epistle written to them, and not simply the obseruation of any day; for, as after shall bee made manifest, euery obseruation of the Iewish dayes is not damned by the Apostle, who did sometime obserue them in his owne person, after a most lawfull manner. Neither can the obseruation of all dayes bee a Iewish custome and rite, and Pedagogicall or rudimentarie instruction, but the obseruation onely of these dayes, which are prescribed in the Law: otherwise the Festiuities appointed by Ieroboam, and the festiuall dayes kept by the Heathen, should all bee Iewish Customes and Pedagogicall instructions, which yee will not say, I hope.

                  It is your custome, I perceiue, to falsifie, mutilate, and corrupt the Acts of Assemblies, and testimonies, both of the ancient and moderne Diuines. Beza his testimony yee adulterated in the dispute of kneeling; here yee mutilate Zanchius his testimonie, and bring it directly against his owne minde. He writing vpon the fourth Precept of the Law, pag. 671. mooues this question: An plures habere festos debeat Ecclesia Christi, &c. for answere to this question, he setteth downe two Propositions, and confirmes them at length, the first whereof is this: Tametsi magis consentaneum est cum prima institutione, & cum scriptis Apostolicis, vt vnus tantum dies in septimana sanctificetur; cum Scripturis tamen minime p
                           •
                        gnat, si plures vno sanctificentur, modò omnis absit superstitio, & faciant ad aedificationem, that is, Albeit it be more agreeable to the first institution, and the Apostles writings, that one day onely in the weeke be sanctified; yet it is not repugnant to the Scripture, if moe then one be sanctified, prouiding that all superstition bee auoyded, and that they serue to edification. Hauing confirmed this by the testimonies of the Ancients, as, Euseb. de vita Constant. lib. 4. Sozom. lib. 1. cap. 8. & lib. 2. cap. 19. August. tom. 2. Epist. 118. Epiphan. Tertull. de Idololat. and the practice of the reformed Churches, he concludeth with these wordes; Dubitari igitur non potest, quin liceat Ecclesiae plures dies festos constituere & sanctificare, that is, It may not be doubted, but the Church may lawfully appoint and sanctifie moe festiuall dayes. His second position makes a full answere to the question: Quanquam Ecclesiae Christi liberu

                           que
                         Ecclesia sanctificare solita fuit: that is, Howbeit the Christian Church hath libertie to make choyce of dayes, to sanctifie them, besides the Lords Day: yet it is more honest, commendable, and profitable, to sanctifie these which the ancient, and Apostolique, and most incorrupt Church hath beene in vse to keepe holy. What dayes these were, he shewes in the same place, numbering out the dayes of the Natiuitie, Passion, Resurrection, Ascension, and Pentecost, as principall dayes: and after their enumeration, subjoynes; At

Thus Zanchius is directly contrary to your opinion; for where yee alleadge, that the Apostle condemnes the obseruation of dayes simply, Zanchius affirmes, the obseruation of some dayes, beside the Lords Day, not to bee repugnant to Scripture, as it behoued to be, if the same were condemned by the Apostle for a Iewish rite and Pedagogicall instruction. By this let the Reader iudge, what credit yee deserue in the rest of your reports, where there is no proofe, but your owne affirmation.

The Apostle beares with the infirmitie of the weake Iewes, who vnderstood not the fulnesse of the Christian libertie. And the Ceremoniall Law was not as yet buried. But the same Apostle reproues the Galatians, who had attayned to this libertie, and had once left off the obseruation of dayes. Next, the Iudaicall dayes had once that honour,

as to bee appointed by God himselfe: but the Anniuersarie dayes appointed by men, haue not the like honour.

                  After yee haue vsed two Arguments, to proue, That there is no day of diuine institution, but the Lords Day, a point not controuerted amongst vs, yee labour to answere fiue obiections, which yee propone against your selfe; and the summe of your answere to the first is this: That the dayes wherewith the Apostle comported, were not the anniuersarie dayes appointed by men, but the Iudaicall dayes, which had once that honour to bee appointed of God, and therefore were to be tollerated in the weake Iewes, as long as the Ceremoniall Law, wherein they were commanded, was not buried; the obseruation whereof, notwithstanding, hee condemned and reproued in the Galatians.
                  Out of this answere, I forme this Proposition:
All the dayes, whereof the Apostle condemned the obseruation, were Iudaicall dayes, prescribed in the Ceremoniall Law, tolerated by him in weake Christians, and that once had the honour to be appointed by God himselfe.
                  
                  This Proposition is yours, and is very true. I assume,
But the fiue anniuersarie dayes, appointed by the Assembly of Perth, are not Iudaicall prescribed in the Ceremoniall Law, tolerated by Saint Paul in weake Christians, and such as had once the honour to be appointed by God himselfe.
                  
                  The Assumption is likewise yours, set downe in the last wordes of your Answere, and is true also. Therefore, I conclude,
That the fiue anniuersarie dayes, are not the dayes, whereof the Apostle condemnes the obseruation: Consequently, hee condemnes not the obseruation of dayes simply, as a Iudaicall Rite and Pedagogicall instruction, contrary to your former Assertion.

                  It is secondly obiected, that seeing the Lords Day was instituted in remembrance of Christs resurrection, the other notable acts of Christ ought likewise to be remembred with their seuerall festiuities. Ans. It followes not; that because Christ did institute the remembrance of one benefit, therefore men may institute for other benefits. Secondly, Christs resurrection was a benefit including the rest of his benefits. Thirdly, The Lords Day was not appointed to celebrate the memory of Christs resurrection onely: for then, the resurrection should bee the proper subiect of Diuine seruice euery Lords Day, and then it were vnlawfull to fast thereupon. Fourthly, It is called the Lords Day, either because the Lord did institute it, as the Communion is called the Lords Supper: or else because it was instituted to the Lords honour, and worship, as the Iewish Sabbath is called the Sabbath of the Lord our God. Fiftly, Although it may be applyed to the remembrance of Christs resurrection, seeing he rose that day, and in some sort to be a signe of the heauenly rest, yet that is, but typus communis, & factus, a common type fitted to resemble such things, not typus destinatus, that is, appointed by God for that end. Finally, it was appointed for remembrance of all Christs actions, and for his worship in generall; not in a mysticall manner, for the ioyfull remembrance of his resurrection onely. So to diuide Christs actions, and appoint anniuersary & mysticall dayes for their remembrance, is superstitious will-worship, and a Iudaicall addition to Christs institution, in your mind.

Vnto which I answere, first generally, That it is the iudgement of some recent Diuines,

Sauiour Iesus Christ also rose againe from the dead the same day. In the iudgement of these Ancients, the Lords Day was not onely instituted for the worship of God in generall, and in that respect called the Lords Day, but because Christ rose vpon that day, and by his resurrection stamped it to bee a memoriall as well of his resurrection, as of the eternall rest whereunto we shall be raised on the last day. In a word, it was not onely instituted for order, and policie, but also for a mysterie; and therein differs from Ecclesiasticall dayes, which are onely appointed for a circumstantiall and not for a mysticall vse.

                     ion, and consummation of others, as of the Natiuitie, and Passion: And so generally, and virtute (as wee say) in vertue the Resurrection contaynes the rest, but it contaynes them not distinctly and expresly, as it is necessary we should remember them; for then we should not need any moe Articles of our Creede, but that one of the Resurrection. As the Articles are particular concerning the Natiuitie, Passion, Resurrection, and Ascension, so they ought to bee distinctly and seuerally remembred, both on the Sabbath, and on other conuenient times, which the Church shall appoint.
                  Thirdly, Although the Lords Day was not onely instituted for a memoriall of the Resurrection, yet, that was one of the principall causes wherefore it was sanctified,

rather then any other day of the weeke. Saint Augustine sayes as before, Domini resurrectio consecrauit nobis diem Dominicum, dies Dominicus sacratus est, & declaratus Christi resurrectione, & inde coepit habere festiuitatem suam. And in Tertullian his time, it was indeed esteemed a thing vnlawfull, eyther to fast or kneele vpon the Lords Day, which custome was confirmed in the Councell of Nice, Can. 20. When ye say, that if it were appointed for remembrance of Christs Resurrection, all the diuine Seruice done on the Lords Day, should haue relation only to the Resurrection; It is no consequent: for albeit God blessed, and sanctified the Iewish Sabbath, because hee rested thereon, there were yet other Scriptures read on their Sabbath, then the storie of Creation, and God his rest from it.
                  Fourthly, where ye alledge, that it was called the Lords Day, because it was instituted by the Lord and for the Lord, we will not contend about this, prouiding it be not denyed, that it is called the Lords Day principally, because the Lord rose thereupon, as Augustine, and other Ancients affirme euery-where. The Communion is called the Lords Supper, because hee appointed it to be kept for a memoriall of his death till his comming againe. The Iewish Sabbath was called the Sabbath of the Lord their God, not only because it was consecrated to his worship: for then the New-moones, and all the other Festiuall Dayes should haue beene so named, which they are not; but also because it was the signe and memoriall of Gods rest that Day. Therefore in the fourth Command, it is expressed as the reason, why the Lord did blesse and sanctifie the Sabbath, He rested the seuenth Day therefore (namely, because hee rested on it) hee blessed and hallowed it: euen so is the Sonday sanctified and blessed by our Sauiour, and called the Lords Day, because it hath imprinted in it by his Institution a perpetuall memoriall of his Resurrection, whereby hee abolished all the Sabbaticall shaddowes of the Law; as first, the strict and precise bodily rest, by bringing in, the spirituall and eternall:

Secondly, the memoriall of their temporall deliuerance out of Egypt, by bringing in the eternall and spirituall deliuery from the tyrannie of Satan, the slauerie of sin, and the feare of death: and thirdly, the signe and marke of distinction which separa
                        •
                     ed the Iew and Gentile, and was a part of the partition wall, in respect whereof, the Iewes were called Sabbatarij; all these shaddowes Christ by his Resurrection 
                        •
                     th abolished, and by the obseruation of the Lords Day, they are declared to bee abolished; which the obseruation of no other day of the weeke could haue done, because Christ stamped none of them with the memoriall of his Resurrection, but this Day only whereupon he rose.
                  Against this ye alledge, that it is not typus destinatus, but communis & factus, that is, a Type not instituted by God to be a memoriall of Christs Resurrection, but a common Type fitted to resemble such a thing: the contrary whereof is true. For nothing can bee called a common Type, but that which hath in it selfe by nature, some respect, or qualitie, wherby it is fitted to make the resemblance of such a thing: As in Marriage, in the coniunction of the head and members, there is a fitnesse naturall to resemble our vnion with Christ: So in the Pismire there is a qualitie naturall, to resemble the vertuous man; and in the Lion and Horse, to resemble the strong and stately: but in this day by nature, there is neither qualitie nor respect more, then in any other to make such a resemblance. Moreouer, common Types are neither memorial & prognosticall signes, but demonstratiue only; & all memoriall, & prognosticall signes, which are not naturall, are signes destinate either by God or by man. If ye affirme, that the Lords Day was destinate by man, to be a signe of Christs Resurrection, then yee must grant, that it was instituted by man to bee obserued in remembrance of that benefit, and so it shall not be a day of Diuine, but humane Institution. Lastly, all the times which God hath marked with some rare worke or euent, and hath therefore appointed to bee obserued solemnely, haue euer beene destinate

by God to be memoratiue signes of these same things. So the seuenth Day marked with Gods rest, and therefore blessed and sanctified, is a memoriall of Gods rest, and is called the Sabbath of Iehouah, and it is also a prognosticall signe of the rest of God to be communicated with the faithfull who resemble that rest by a corporall cessation. This the Apostle witnesseth, Heb. 4.9. There remaynes therefore a rest to the people of God, for hee that enters into his rest, hee also ceases from his owne workes, as God did from his. In like manner, the fourteenth day of the first Moneth marked with that rare deliuerance from the destroying Angell, and their escape out of Egypt, and therefore appointed to be solemnly obserued to the honour of God: was destinated by God to bee a memoriall of that their deliuerance, and called the Passeouer of the Lord. And euen so the Lords Day being marked with that rare and incomparable benefit of the Resurrection, and consecrated in the iudgement of all the Ancients to the worship of God insteed of the Iewish Sabbath, is a memoriall signe of the Resurrection destinated by the Lord himselfe; a demonstratiue signe of our spirituall Resurrection from sinne, to newnesse of life; and a prognosticall signe of our corporeall Resurrection vnto euerlasting life. This Saint Augustine expresseth in the words before cited: Dominicus dies Christi resurrectione sacratus, aeternam non solum spiritus, sed etiam corporis requiem praefigurat. In end where yee conclude, that the Lords Day was not appointed only for a remembrance of his Resurrection after a mysticall manner, but for the remembrance of all his actions and worship in generall, if your meaning bee, that on the Lords Day, all Christs actions may and ought to be orderly remembred, as occasion requires, and not his Resurrection only, it is true that yee say: but if your meaning bee, that the sanctification of the Lords Day was not ordayned to be a memoriall of Christs Resurrection, I deny your assertion, & preferre to your opinion, the iudgement of all the Ancients.
                  
                     Vnto that which yee subioyne, that it is a superstitious wil-worship, and a Iudaicall addition to Christs Institution, to diuide Christs actions, and appoint Anniuersary and Mysticall dayes for their remembrance; I reply, that it is a superstitious wil-worship indeed, and a Iudaicall addition to Christs Institution, so to tye all the worship of God to the Lords Day, that no other day nor time may bee appointed for preaching, praying or remembring any of Christs benefits: seeing vnder the Gospell, as Tertullian speakes, De Baptismo, omnis dies Domini est, omnis hora, omne tempus habile est baptismo: that is, euery day is the Lords, euery houre, and euery time is fit for Baptisme. If for Baptisme, why not for Doctrine, and Prayer, and Thankesgiuing, and all other parts of Gods Worship? For albeit the Lords Day be consecrated to the Worship of God, yet the Worship is not tied to it, but from one Sabbath to another, and from one New-Moone to another, all flesh may appeare before the Lord. That which ye speake of diuiding Christs actions, and the appointing of mysticall dayes, is partly foolish, and partly false. Is it not a folly to thinke, that the actions of Christ ought not to bee diuided, and seuerally remembred in Lectures and Sermons, seeing the Spirit of God hath diuided them in this Storie, and that it is impossible at once to remember them all? And it is false also, because for rememberance of them no day is appointed to bee kept mystically as a part of the worship, but only circumstantially for order, and commoditie: which kinde of obseruation is not a superstitious wil-worship, but a lawfull determination of commodious times for the worship of God, belonging to the power and policie of the Church.
               
               
                  PP.
                  It is thirdly obiected, that Paul kept the Feast of Pentecost, Act. 20. 1. Cor. 16. I answere it was the Iewish Pentecost, &c.

                  If it was the Iewish Pentecost, then Saint Paul did not only obserue an Anniuersary Day, but such also, as

was legall, and abrogated by the Gospell, and such as hee discharges the Church to obserue: Yet I hope, yee will not say, that his obseruation was Superstitious or Pedagogicall, because he obserued it not as a necessary part of Gods worship prescribed in the Law, in respect whereof only, it was Pedagogicall; but as a fit circumstance and opportunitie for the worke of his Ministerie, like as he did often obserue the Iewish Sabbaths, which was not onely lawfull, but in those times verie expedient to be done by him. Hereby it is manifest, that the obseruation of dayes, is not condemned by the Apostle, as a Iewish Rite, because Anniuersarie, Monethly, or Weekly; but because it was conioyned with opinion of necessitie, and vsed as a Legall worship: therefore although vpon the Iewish Sabbath, or vpon their Pentecost diuine worship was performed, as the Euangell preached, the Sacraments celebrated, Prayers publikely conceiued, &c. If these things were done, without any mysticall relation, or respect had to the day, but only because the time was opportune and happily fit for Gods Worke, the exercise was lawfull and could not bee condemned. So wee finde in some churches, that on eueryday the sacramēt was ministred: that on the Iewish Sabbath, they had an ordinarie Fast, and no well aduised Christian did euer thinke these to be vnlawfull, by reason of the day. For if to the cleane, euery thing be cleane, all dayes are cleane and sanctified to euery lawfull exercise of the man who is himselfe made cleane by the bloud of Christ: Consequently, euery day, whether it be Weekly or Anniuersarie, is cleane, and sanctified by Christ, to the exercise of any part of his Worship, which shall bee thought meete by the Church to be performed to his honour, and the edification of her selfe. The Legall Sabbath and Pentecost, which were abrogated, could not make the Euangelicke Worship, which was performed on them by the Apostles, vnlawfull; farre lesse can the Lords Day, such as the Christian Pasche, and Whitsonday are, or any other day of the Weeke, Moneth, or Yeare, which were neuer legally obserued,

make the Doctrine, Prayers, and Sacraments administred on them, vnlawfull, and superstitious.
                  To conclude, I finde in this Obiection a Solution to all your Arguments, for here I find, that there may be a lawfull obseruation of dayes which are abrogated, let be of dayes which are not discharged, so the obseruation bee not legall, with opinion of necess

So Saint Paul keeped many Sabbaths, and the Pentecost, whereon Saint Peter also conuerted three thousand by his first preaching. This is the obseruation, for which only we stand; against which, ye haue neuer concluded a contradictory, but either against the Legall of the Iewish, or superstitious of the Gentiles. So all your Arguments fall vnder one forme of Caption which wee call ignorantia Elenchi, when a contradiction seemes to bee, where there is none, because the tearmes in the apparant contradiction are not taken in the same s

                  It is fourthly obiected out of the Epistles of Polycarpus and Polycrates, extant in the Historie of Eusebius, and out of Beda following Eusebius, that the Apostles kept the Feast of Easter.

But ye make mention of Polycarpus Epistle

extant in Eusebius, and in Eusebius there is no Epistle of Polycarpus; onely Irenaeus in a Letter that hee sends to Victor, mentions him. The Epistles of Polycrates yee affirme to bee counterfeit, and vpon what reason? Because, ye say, that it is said in the Epistles, that Saint Iohn bore on his fore-head pontificale petalum, that is, the golden plate, or the High Priests Mitre. Polycrates, ye thinke, would not haue written so, because Scaliger sayes, that no man will grant, that eyther Iohn or Iames did beare it, who vnderstand that none of Christs Apostles was a Priest; and that it was lawfull to none, but the High Priest to beare the golden plate. It is true, that Polycrates in propertie of speech would not haue written so; but what is more frequent amongst the Ancients then by such flowers & colours of Rhetorick to describe the Euangelick Ministers, amōgst whom such as Polycarpus, Thrasias, and others by him named, Iohns authoritie was as great, as was the High Priests aboue the inferiour vnder the Law? Therfore to distinguish him frō them Polycrates attributes to him the name and ornament of the High Priest. So Tertullian de Baptismo, distinguisheth the Bishop from the Elder, and the Deacon calling him the High Priest, Dandi quidem habet ius summus Sacerdos, qui est Episcopus, dehinc Presbyteri, & Diaconi. Shall wee esteeme this Treatise of Tertullian counterfeite, because hee calleth the Bishoppe an High Priest? This is too weake a warrant, whereon to build an improbation against so strong a partie as Eusebius.

His proofe out of Scripture, Psal. 118.8. 1. Cor. 7.8. are very weake; for the first testimonie is applyed to euery Lords Day, & is not to be restrained to Pasche day. The other testimonie imports not a Celebratiō of Easter Feast, vpō any Anniuersary day, but rather the Apostle teaches vs to celebrate this Feast of the Passeouer all the yeare long. His last proofe is taken from the custome

of Baptisme, and the Eucharist ministred vpon Pasche day, as if they had beene ministred only vpon that day.

The testimonie of the 118. Psalme, yee say should be applyed to euery Lords Day, but seeing he rose on the first day of them, as yee cannot deny, doubtlesse when that day returnes by course once euery yeare; vnto it, all the prototype and architype of them all, of euery congruity, saies the Bishop, the Resurrection is to be applyed somwhat more. This by example he makes plain. His Maiesties deliuerance vpon the fift dayes of August, and Nouember being Tuesdayes both, wee keepe for their remembrance a Sermon on Tuesday euery week of the yeare: but when by course of the yeare in their seuerall moneths, the very originall dayes thēselues come about, shal we not, doe wee not celebrate them in much more solemne manner? what question is there? weigh them well, ye shal find the case alike▪ one cannot be, but the other also must bee Apostolike. These are the words of the learned Bishop, which proue his intent so cleerly, that ye are forced to flye to another shift, as your custome is, & say, If the Prophesie should be applyed to any precise day, it should bee applyed to the Lords day. But seeing the words are to be vnderstood aswel of Dauid as of Christ, the day is taken, ye say, for the time indefinitely, wherin Dauid was made King, & the corner stone of Gods people. This is your shift, which cannot auaile you: for if it be taken indefinitely for the day wherin Dauid was made the typick corner Stone, then much more must it bee taken for the definite day, whereon Christ the Veritie was made the true corner Stone of the Church of God. If of Dauids Coronation, it might be said, This is the day which the

Lord hath made, Let vs reieyce and bee glad in it: much more is it to be said of that day, whereon CHRIST rose againe from the dead, and was crowned with glory and honour, and set ouer the workes of Gods hands, and had all things put vnder his feet. For this day hath euer beene esteemed since the resurrection of our Lord, a day made by God, not by creation onely, but also by institution.

                  In the other testimonie, I grant with S.

Otherwise, euerie day is the Lords, euerie houre, and euerie time is meete for Baptisme. The solemnitie may be lesse, but the grace is not diminished. So that which ye say, that Baptisme was tied of olde to Pentecost and Easter, is false. But that which the Bishop sayes is true, that on these daies▪; the Sacraments were lwaies solemnely ministred.

                  I will now frame one argument against this conceit of Apostolicall tradition, and obseruation of Pasche. The Apostles were led all their life-time by the infallible direction of the Spirit. If they had accorded on the obseruation of Easter, they had not d

But ye say, the Apostles who were gouerned by the Spirit, could not disagree on the day. Did not Paul and Barnabas agree in planting of the Gospell? yet they disagreed in chusing of their Fellow-Labourer. Paul & Peter agreed on this ground, that a man is not iustified by the workes of the Law, but by the Faith of Iesus Christ: yet in the practise of the workes of the Law, they disagreed, Gal. 2. They agreed in the substance, yet in the matter of circumstance, and vse of things in their owne nature indifferent, they disagreed.

But to be short, this argument is answered by the learned Bishop in that Sermon so fully, as may giue contentment to any that delights not in contention. His words are these, Pag▪ 25. Iames Bishop of Ierusalem, and others who

                        ucceeded him, the sooner to win their Brethren, the Iewes, condescended to keepe Easter 14. Lunae, the 14. of the Moone, as they did. That

which by them was done by way of condescension, was after by some vrged as a matter of necessitie. So we see S. Paul when he came vp to Ierusalem to the Pentecost, was counsailed or not scandalizing the Iewes, to carrie himselfe as one that obserued the Law, and practise some legall ceremonies to that effect: which he did, vsing them not as a part of diuine worship, but as indifferent things, and meanes expedient to win him credite with the Iewes, that hee might edifie them in the truth. So himselfe sayes, He became all things to all men, that he might winne some. The keeping of the 14. day by Iohn and Iames, is not an argument that they disagreed from the rest in iudgement, touching the set day (if any then was determined) more then the practise of other ceremonies proues their disagreeing from S. Paul in the poynt of Christian libertie: for this they did onely by way of condescension. So the Apostles in these times might haue kept Easter vpon diuerse daies, by the direction of the Spirit, because the solemne commemoration of our Sauiours resurrection, which we call Easter, is not to be kept at any set time for any mystery, that one day hath more then another by diuine institution. The contentions therefore about the day were iustly blamed by the reformed Churches, who acknowledge no day, except the Christian Sabbath, to haue greater prerogatiue then anothe

                     . But the greater part of the world keeping the solemnitie of Easter vpon the Lords Day, which followed the 14. of the Moone, the Churches of Asia being a fewer number, did not well to preferre the singularitie of their opinion and custome to vnitie and conformitie with the greater part of Christendome in such a poynt. Againe, Victor Bishop of Rome cannot bee excused, who first did vrge conformitie, & pressed it by violence vpon the Churches that were without his Iurisdiction; and to excommunicate them, was an insolent tyrannie, seeing they were not subiect to his power. Yet after the Nicene Councell had setled that controuersie, and determined the day, these must iustly be blamed, that contentiously troubled the Christian peace, disobeyed the

Canon of the Councell, and were disconforme to the rest of the Churches, not by mistaking the day as some were, but through wilfulnesse and pride, the parents of contention.

Such as inhabite Rome, and the West parts of the World, alledge Peter and Paul, and yet there is none of them can shew in Writing any testimonie for confirmation of their custome.

                     ble conceit: but that is not sufficient to infringe Saint Augustines rule, and the probations that he brings are of no force: for first, it makes nothing against Augustines rule, that the Easterne Churches kept the solemnitie on one day, and the Westerne on another: because Saint Augustine sayes not that the commemoration of these benefits was made vpon one and the selfe-same day: onely hee sayes, Anniuersaria solennitate

celebrantur, 
                     
                        〈◊〉
                      is, They are yearely celebrated after a solemne manner. The diuersitie of the day confuteth not this assertion, but confirmes rather his saying: namely, that the solemnitie was obserued through all the World, seeing in one part it was celebrated for winning of the Iewes, according to the practise of S. Iohn, and in the rest of the World, on Pasche Sonday, whereon our Sauiour rose, according to the tradition of Saint Paul, the Apostle of the Gentiles. So this same solemnitie being kept through the whole Church, although not on the same day, Saint Augustines rule remains good, that the solemne commemoration of Christs resurrection, is Apostolicke.
                  The next probation is no better, to wit, that there is no testimonie in writing for the confirmation of that custome: for by this reason it would follow, that the obseruation of Sonday in stead of the Iewish Sabbath, hath preuayled by a priuate custome only: For in the Apostolique writings, we haue no testimonie for the confirmation of that custome. In Scripture we reade, that our Sauiour rose on that day, that on that day he appeared to his Disciples, that on that day the Apostle appointed collections to be made for the poore, that on that day at Troas the Disciples were assembled to breake bread, and that S. Paul preached: All these actions make aswell for the obseruation of Pasche Sonday, and as the Bishop of Winchester saith, somewhat more, seeing it is after a sort, the same day by reuolution, whereon our Sauiour did rise: yet all these practises, exercises, and meetings on the Lords day had not demonstrate the sanctification of it, if it had not beene perpetually and vniuersally obserued afterwards by the Church. This constant and vniuersall obseruation of the Church, hath declared these practises to be exemplarie, and that our Sauiour did consecrate that day by his resurrection, and apparitions, to be in stead of the Sabbath. Vpon this ground S. August. Epist. ad Ianuar. 118. sayes, Illa quae non scripta, sed tradita custodimus, quae quidem

This rule of Saint Augustine, if it bee not demonstratiue, yet it is more probable then Socrates his opinion; for it is more like a custome receiued by the vniuersall Church, should proce

                  Yet to confirme his opinion, yee say, that Iustine Martyr mentions no Holy day, but the Lords Day. What then? Hee had not the occasion: yet Tertullian, who flourished but fortie yeares after him, in the second booke directed to his wife, hath these wordes: Quis deni

Haereticos, mentions one Blastus, whom hee calls an Heretike, for maintayning that Pasche should bee kept on the 14. day of the Moone, as the Iewish custome was. Tertullian flourished in the yeare of our Lord 183. and speaking thus of Pasche, not, as of a new Constitution, but as of a custome long before receiued in the Church, does confirme the Bishop of Winchester his iudgement, That in all l
                        •
                     kelihood this obseruation was Apostolique. By Apostolique, I meane not a doctrinall point, which is to bee obserued as a substantiall part of diuine worship, or a condition necessary to saluation, but the imitation onely of an Apostolique practice concerning order and policie: neither doe I meane such a practice as is expresly set downe in Scripture,

and vniuersally obserued through the world, such as the Lords Day is, for such a practice hath the strength of a diuine Precept: but I vnderstand such a practice, as albeit it be not recorded in Scripture, to haue beene done by the Apostles themselues, or the Churches in their time, yet the same being vniuersally receiued in the world, and obserued since the Apostles dayes, is most probably presumed to haue beene practised in their times, and allowed by them. And in this, the Lords Day differs from Pasche, and the other three dayes mentioned by Saint Augustine, that the Lords Day hath not onely the vniuersall and perpetuall obseruation of the Church, since the dayes of the Apostles, but also the practice of our Sauiour, his Apostles, and the Church in their times expresly recorded in Scripture: The other haue onely an vniuersall and constant practice of the Church, since the Apostles time, which not the lesse ought to be preferred to any priuate or late particular custome. And to returne to the Act of Perth, it ordaynes none of these dayes to be kept for Diuine and Apostolique, but onely, that on them once in the yeare a solemne commemoration be made of the benefits of our Redemption; and therefore the Reasons ye bring to proue, that these dayes are not Apostolique, impugne no wayes the lawfullnesse of the act. Where yee say, that the obseruation of the Passion day, hath brought into the church set dayes of fasting, condemned by our Diuines, I aske you, how yee doe proue that affirmation? It is enough yee haue said it. But to conclude this point, I doe verily thinke, That to fast and pray at some set times, were lesse offensiue to God, then to bee often feasting and surfetting, pratling, and lying, traducing our Brethren, and condemning the good order and policie of Gods Church.

the dayes wherein they were wrought, as Hooker sayes, or consecrate them, as Bellarmine sayes, they ought to be knowne; otherwise it will fall out, that we shall keepe the dayes holy that were neuer aduanced, nor consecrated by Christs action on institution.

But from the beginning, we haue declared according to the iudgement, not of Bellarmine but of our best reformed Churches and Diuines, that these dayes are not kept for any relation, that the worship hath to them, as if by Christs actions or institution they were to be honoured with some religious exercise; but for order and policy only, as the most meet and oportune occasions in the iudgement of the primitiue Church, and in our estimation most meet, for testifying our conformitie with her, and with the whole Christian world euer since.

What hath beene the cause hereof, and by what meanes the abuse may be best remedied, wise men will easily consider.

                  It is commonly obiected, That wee may aswell keepe a day for the Natiuitie, as for the Resurrection of Christ. We haue answered already, That Christs day or the Lords Day, is the day appointed for remembrance of his Natiuitie, and all his actions and benefits, aswell as for the Resurrection. Next, the one is morall and weekely: the other, is mysticall and anniuersarie. The Lords Day it selfe, is no longer to vs mysticall but morall, sayes Willet, and therefore Pasche day is a mysticall Sabbath and anniuersarie, whereas the Lords Day it selfe should be onely morall.
               
               
                  ANS.
                  The answere which yee haue already made, is already confuted. The Lords Day is generally appointed for remembrance of all his actions, therefore none of his actions may or should bee remembred at any other set time. This consequence is not necessary: for then we may not remember his actions, in the morning and euening Lectures, wee may not remember them in Sermons & Exercises on weekly dayes, nor may wee remember them in Catechizing the people. Your next answere is, That the day of the Natiuitie is mysticall: This is contrarie to that which yee cited out of Saint Augustine, pag. 68. Ille celebratur ob memoriam solùm, & ideo semper die vigesimo quinto Decembris: at iste celebratur ob memoriam, & Sacramentum. But, I pray you, How proue yee obseruation of the day of Natiuitie to bee mysticall? because it is anniuersarie, yee say: If this be your Argument (for I finde no other here) it is not good: for in the reuolution of time there is no mysterie, but in the signification,

and we haue often said before, that we obserue no day for signification, but the Lords Day onely. The rest we obserue as times meet and commodious, for the worship appointed to be done on them. As to Doctor Willets assertion, That the Lords Day is not mysticall to vs, I oppone to it Saint Augustines iudgement, who calls it, as yee heard before, a figure and type of life eternall, which is confirmed by the Apostle in the fourth to the Hebrewes. But Doctor Willet, I hope, takes (mysticall) for a darke and obscure shadow of things to come, such as the festiuall dayes vnder the Law were, kept in remembrance, not of spirituall and eternall, but of temporall benefits, which were shadowe
                        •
                      of spirituall and eternall benefits to come: And in this sense, the Lords Day is not mysticall, for it is not kept in remembrance of temporall benefits, which are shadowes of spirituall and eternall, but in remembrance of Christs Resurrection, by whom we are put in present possession of our spirituall rest and life, and in hope of eternall. In respect whereof, as it is a memoriall signe of the Resurrection of our Sauiour, so is is a demonstratiue signe of the benefit which wee enjoy of spirituall rest, and prognosticall of our eternall, and therefore is called a figure and type, by Saint Augustine. Thus taking a mysterie in a large sense for any significant signe in Religion, it may be called mysticall. The Sacraments of the new Testament are called mysteries by the Ancients, not in the sense that the Sacraments of the old Testament were called mysteries, for they were so called, because they were darke and obscure shadowes of things to come; but our Sacraments are the liuely Images of the things themselues, by reason of the plaine and manifest Word of the Gospell annexed to them. By this distinction Saint Augustine and Doctor Willet may be agreed.

But to celebrate an Anniuersarie solemnitie, and to keepe a Sabbath of rest in remembrance, it is a pedagogicall ceremonie of the Iewes, &c.

                  Wee thinke it sufficient to haue made that obiection once, because it hath neuer yet beene answered: but yee propone it often to assay, if yee shall bee able to fall on some solide solution at last; yet like an euill Archer, the longer yee shoote, yee stray the further from the marke: Yee thinke an Anniuersarie remembrance may be kept, but an Anniuersarie solemnitie should not bee celebrated: yee hide your minde from simple people vnder a mysticall solemnitie of words, but to speake that plainly, which yee call the celebration of an Anniuersarie solemnitie, your meaning must be, if yee contradict the Act, that preaching should not bee made, prayers, thanksgiuing, and prayses should not be offered on certayne set times in the yeare, in remembrance of Christs Natiuitie, Passion, &c. If yee will haue no such exercise to bee vsed, what Anniuersarie remembrance is it that yee would haue obserued? Is it a priuy meditation in our Chambers, whereunto neither God nor Man is priuie, or some occasionall remembrance in our Lectures and Sermons, as they fall out now and then? Is this the thankfulnesse that wee are taught by the light of Nature and the Word of God, to render for the inestimable benefits of our redemption, which God hath vniuersally and publikely bestowed vpon all?
                  Oh, but to keepe a Sabbath of rest in remembrance, say yee, is a pedagogicall ceremonie. To keepe a mysticall rest▪ such as the rest of the Sabbath was, is pedagogicall: but to keepe a rest for the more commodious and solemne performance

of a great and diuine action, such as the commemoration of Christs Birth, Death, &c. is not pedagogicall, but necessary for the commoditie, and celebritie of the worship, which cannot bee well and worthily performed without cessation from other seruile businesse. That this is the vse of the rest commanded in his Maiesties Proclamation, is manifest by the reasons set downe therein, in these words: That euery one may the better attend the holy exercises, which are to bee kept in the Church on these times. Yee are cunning to deceiue the simple with ambiguitie of words. There is a rest that is ciuilly kept, which is a cessation from our ordinary workes for some other ciuill employment, as for marriages, triumphs, weapon-shewings, and such like; this rest is lawfull, but it is not Sabbaticall. There is a rest kept superstitiously, as when men ceasse from their labou

                     s, for some foolish feares of ill successe, by reason of the time: this is not called a Sabbath of rest, but a superstitious rest. There is a rest kept idolatrously for the honour of idols, as the Baechanalia, Floralia, and the holy dayes proclaymed by the Israelites, for honour of their golden Calfe: These are damnable rests. Finally, there is a rest that is kept religiously, and this rest is kept either for celebritie and commoditie of the religious action onely, or mystically: for commoditie and celebritie of the religious seruice, a rest is kept in all the solemne times of fasting: a rest is kept in the houres of Prayers, or Preaching, and other diuine Seruice. And such is the rest, that his Maiestie hath appointed to bee obserued. The rest, kept mystically, was a significant rest of some thing by-past, present, or to come; such was the rest of the Iewish Sabbath, and of the Legall Festiuities, and such Augustine holds, and other many good Diuines, our rest on the Lords Day to be, from the fourth to the Hebrewes. This is called a Sabbath of rest, such a rest his Maiestie hath not commanded; but a rest for commoditie and celebritie of the diuine Seruice only, which

in nothing is like to the Iewes Frontlets, Phylacteries, and such other Legall shadowes.

                  Pope Alexander the third gaue this reason, wherefore the Romane Church kept not a Holy day to the Trinitie, Quoniam Ecclesia Romana in vsu non habet, &c. Because, sayes he, Glorie to the Father, and to the Sonne, and to the holy Ghost, and other such like things, belonging to the praise of the Trinitie, are daily vttered. The Popes reason is grounded vpon this rule, Whatsoeuer is intreated or remembred in the diuine seruice ordinarie, ought not to haue a speciall Holy day, to celebrate the memorie of the same, beside the day alreadie decerned by the Lord. We assume, Christs Natiuitie, Death, Resurrection, &c. are not onely the continuall meditation of a Christian in priuate, but also a remembred, and intreated in the ordinarie and publique seruice. Euery Communion Sonday is a Passion Holy day. Euery Sabbath, that Christs Natiuitie is preached, is a time of remembrance of his Natiuitie. But to ordayne an Anniuersarie day, or houre of rest, for commemoration of his Natiuitie or Passion, and specially vpon a weeke day, is a Iewish rudiment, and a preiudice to Christian libertie.
               
               
                  ANS.
                  I answere to the Proposition first, and I grant, that whatsoeuer is remembred in the ordinarie diuine seruice, ordinarily and particularly, such as, Glory bee to the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghost, which was said in the diuine seruice ordinarily and particularly, that needes not any particular commemoration vpon some speciall time, sayes Pope Alexander: but the inestimable benefits and actions of our Sauiour, which were not ordinarily and particularly remembred in the daily seruice, but onely in the rehearsall of the Creede, where all the Articles of Religion are remembred; Pope Alexander thought, that for commemoration.

of these, a set time was necessary. So the Proposition, which is your ground, being taken according to the Popes minde, is against you.
                  Next, I answere, your Assumption is false: These benefits are not the continuall meditation of Christians in priuate; for I am assured, if yee bee a Christian, yee did not meditate on these things Christianly, when yee did meditate this Pamphlet against the honour of Christ his Passion, Resurrection, Ascension, and against the power of the Church.
                  Thirdly, where yee say, That they are remembred in the ordinarie and publique seruice, that falleth our sometimes, but not purposely. When it happens, it is by occasion, and generally that they are touched, because they occurre in your Text perhaps. Otherwise, they may lye buried seuen yeares before they be purposely remembred. And when yee say, That euery Communion Sonday is a Passion Holy day, I would demand, whether it were lawfull on the Saterday or Friday before that Communion Sonday, to make a Sermon on the Passion for preparation of the people to the Communion, as I hope, you haue practised sometime your selfe. Now, if this, which your selfe and many others haue done, bee lawfull, is it not lawfull also to doe the like on Friday before Easter, which is a Communion Sonday by the acts of our Church? And this is all, that they ordayned by the Act of the Assembly at Perth, touching the remembrance of the Passion. Further, to that which yee say, That euery Sabbath whereon the Natiuitie is preached, is a time of remembrance of his Natiuitie: I answere, That it is but occasionall, and so falls out by the Text which the Minister teaches; but neither doe the people resort purposely to Church to heare the Natiuitie intreated at that time, nor does the Minister intreat of it at large, as the same ought.
                  Finally, yee conclude with that often repeated calumnie,

that to ordayne a certayne anniuersary day, or houre of rest, for commemoration of these benefits, is a Iewish rudiment, and a preiudice to Christian libertie. The first is false: For the appointing of houres and times weekely, monethly, or yearely, for preaching any part of the Gospell, is no Iewish rudiment, but a lawfull, good, and wise Christian policie, practised 1500. yeares before yee were borne, throughout the whole Christian world, and allowed by the best Diuines both in the primitiue and reformed Church. So farre is it from being a preiudice to Christian libertie, that herein a principall part of our libertie consists, that we are not astricted in the worship of God to Times, Places, or Persons, and others such circumstances by the Gospell, but haue libertie to choose and appoint such as wee thinke most expedient for the honour of God, and edification of his people: of the which libertie the purpose of your Pamphlet is to spoile vs, in the Sacrament astricting vs to the gesture of sitting onely, and for Gods publique worship, to the Lords Day onely; as if the Church had no power to appoint preaching, prayers, and diuine seruice to be done at any other time, or the Sacrament to bee receiued in any other fashion.

                  As for the fift day of Nouember, it is not an Holy day; it is not a day of cessation from worke, which is one of the chiefe elements of an Holy day, &c.

                  If an Anniuersarie commemoration of a benefit with cessation from worke, suppose for a part of the day, bee Iewish, then the fift of Nouember (yee forget the fift of August) must bee Iewish: for on it, there is an Anniuersarie cōmemoration of an exceeding great benefit, and a cessation from worke, during the space of the commemoration, which is a part of the day: Therefore, according to

your reason it must be Iewish. Where yee say that cessation from workes is one of the chiefe Elements of a holy day, it is true, if the cessation, and rest be a part of the worship: but if it bee only accessorie to the worship, and a circumstance thereof, it is no Element of a holy day. The rest of the Iewish Sabbath, and Iewish Festiuities was a mysticall part of the worship, but the cessation which is only appointed from cōmoditie, & celebrity of the worship, such as that which is commanded to be kept by the Proclamation on these fiue dayes, and we are in vse to keepe at our weekly preaching, and Prayers, and vpon the fift dayes of August and Nouember, is only accessory, and serues for commoditie, and celebritie of the worship, without which the same could not duly be performed.

                     Grant the keeping of holy dayes to haue beene at the beginning a matter indifferent, and setting aside all the former Reasons, yet ought they to be abolished, because according to the rule of the Fathers commended to vs by Zanchius, Non male igitur fecerunt, qui omnia praeter diem Dominicum aboleuerunt, Things indifferent when they are abused and polluted with Superstition, ought to be abolished.

                  If all things indifferent which haue beene polluted with Superstition ought to be abolished, then all the Parish Churches in Scotland should be demolished: for to preach or not to preach in them is a thing indifferent. Ringing of Bels in time of Popery was abused superstitiously, kneeling, (an indifferent Ceremonie which may bee vsed, and not vsed at Prayer) hath beene most vily abused to Idolatry in praying to Idols; singing was abused to Superstition, and Idolatry, for Hymnes were sung to the Virgin Mary, yea, to her the hundred and fiftie Psalmes of Dauid were diuerted or peruerted, and sung in a str

                  Albeit Zanchius sayes, non male fecerunt, &c. Hee sayes not simply, that they ought to bee abolished; nor does hee reprooue them, who retayned the dayes kept by the ancient Apostolike Church, Quanquam Ecclesiae Christi liberum est, sayes he, quos velit praeter Dominicum dies sibi sanctificandos deligere, honestius tam

                         ad Gelasium, qui praefuit Romanae Ecclesiae, Anno 495. I maruell how ye can cite Zanchius so confidently for you, as if he had disallowed the obseruation of these dayes. And if ye will stand to his doctrine and iudgement, our controuersie shall soone be at an end. For this hee sayes expresly, that the Church hath power to make choice of the dayes shee likes best, and sanctifie them besides the Lords Day. If ye will haue vs yeelding to Zanchius, when he sayes, non male fecerunt, doe ye also yeeld to him, when hee sayes, Ecclesiae liberum est, quos velit dies sibi sanctificare. But to the end the singularitie and noueltie of your doctrine may bee euident, and our defence may bee seene to agree with the Primitiue Church her practice, and the iudgement of the best Diuines amongst the reformed, wee grant with Zanchius, that they who abolished all dayes did not ill, but well in respect of the time, and estate of their Church: As for example, it was not euill done by our Church, to discharge the obseruation of all Festiuall Dayes, because in the beginning, they could not be lawfully obserued for the raritie of Preachers at least vniuersally; for in Congregations where Pastours were wanting to inform the people, the obseruation of them should haue entertayned the superstitious conceit, which the Papists formerly had of them. Neither did they euill in

                     Zanchius iudgement, that retayned the dayes obserued by the Primitiue Church; consequently in appointing on these 5 dayes Sermons to be preached and diuine Seruice done, cannot be euil. Specially, if we shall consider, how notwithstanding of all the Acts, Ciuil, and Ecclesiastick made against the superstitious obseruation, and prophane abuse of Zule day, our people could neuer bee induced to labour on that day, and leaue their idlenesse: and wheresoeuer diuine Seruice was done that day, as in Townes that haue alwayes morning and euening Prayers, they were euer perceiued to resort in greater numbers on that day then any other to the Church: So these dayes being spent prophanely by the greatest sort and superstitiously by many, these euils could not be better remooued, then by Doctrine and diuine Seruice, whereby the time is well spent, and these conceits of the people driuen away, and their opinions confuted in the time, when the same are most pregnant.
                  Saint Paul tooke occasion by inscription of the Altar in Areopage, To the vnknowne God, to preach the true God to the Gentiles: thereby he did not authorize their Superstition, which hee there cals 
                        〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉
                     , but refuted it with a diuine Sermon: he also kept the Iewish Sabbaths and Pentecost, which both were abolished; not to confirme the Iewes in the Pedagogie of the Law, but to take the commoditie of the time, and confluence of people in it, for preaching the Gospell, that he might draw them with time from the shaddowes to the substance, and truth in Christ. So wee who haue the like occasion by confluence of our people on that day to Church, haue not done euil to appoint sermons to bee made on the day of the Natiuitie, that the people may thereby be drawne from profanenesse and superstition to the true worship of God, and to the religious exercises vsed in the Primitiue Church on that day; whereof the Sermons preached by Saint Augustine and many others, yet extant in their Monuments, beare witnesse: as also that in obseruing

this, and the remanent dayes, we might keepe a conformitie with them, which Zanchius holds to be honest, laudable, and profitable. Finally, that in so lawful a thing we might giue odience to his Maiestie our Souereign, desiring an vniformity amongst the Churches of his Maiesties Dominions, in things which are neither against pietie nor good manners, and haue beene obserued vniuersally throughout the World in the most pure Ages of the Church.

                  We worshippe not Christ by obseruation of the day, but by the obseruation of an euangelicke and lawfull worshippe done to him vpon the day. With this ambiguitie from the beginning, ye presse to abuse the Reader: for the obseruation of a day is taken (as wee said before) two waies; eyther for a sacramentall and mysticall obseruation, that is, when the day is obserued as a type of some spirituall or eternall benefit to come: This obseruation of a day, is a part of the worship, and we condemne it as yee doe: or it is taken for the obseruation of a fit occasion, and time, to the exercise of religious and diuine Seruice, as we obserue the dayes of fasting, houres of prayers, preaching, and exercise. This manner of obseruation is onely accessorie to the worship, and is no part thereof; and so we obserue the fiue dayes.
                  The Papists in dedicating dayes to Saints, appointed dayes to be kept mystically, and not circumstantially onely: When we dedicate a day to Christ, we dedicate it not as a mysticall signe, and make it a part of his worship, but as a meete circumstance for the worship to be performed to him. And whosoeuer he bee that holds Christ may not be worshipped on these dayes, and on all dayes and times priuately, and publiquely, is a dogmatist and teacher of will-worship: for if the Apostle call this a Doctrine of will-worship, Touch not, taste not, such and such things as are in themselues indifferent; certainely by the same reason, he who out of the temeritie of his singular, proud, and wilfull opinion sayes, Teach not on such a purpose; Heare not such a purpose; Worship not after such a manner; Giue not thanks for such a benefit vpon such a day; not because the doctrine and worship in vnlawfull in it selfe, but by reason of the time, which is an indifferent circumstance, Non est verus Apostoli interpres, sed verè dogmatistes

                  Your assumption must be this. But to make commemoration of the inestimable benefits of our redemption vpon the fiue anniuersarie daies, hath beene abolished lawfully by ciuill and Ecclesiasticall Lawes, &c. This assumption is false, in all the parts of it; for first, as we haue shewed, the obseruation ordayned by the Act at Perth was neuer abolished by Ciuill or Ecclesiasticall Lawes, nor yet by consent and vniforme practise of the contrarie: Onely the superstitious obseruation of these dayes with opinion of necessitie, as a part of diuine worship, and the profane abuse thereof, with excessiue banqueting, playing, and carroling was condemned. Secondly, to your prescription of time in things moueable, I answer, that circumstantiall ceremonies belonging to Religion, are alwaies alterable, and neither can bee abolished nor established by prescription: for if prescription had force in such things, then the space of 1200. yeares, during which time these fiue dayes were obserued vniuersally throughout the whole Christian world, sho
                        •
                     ld haue greater force to establish the obseruation of them, then the abrogation of seuen and fiftie yeares in durance onely. Continuance of time does not establish without change such things, but giues occasion to alter them rather, when the alteration makes for the honour of God, the edification of his Church, and auoyding corruption. Thirdly, the Sermons of reuerend Preachers condemned onely, the superstitious and profane obseruation of these dayes, and not the obseruation made by the Primitiue, and by the reformed Churches in

our time, which is the obseruation onely commaunded by the Act of Perthe. Fourthly, If any were censured, it was not for any fault in the action it selfe, but for transgression of the Ecclesiasticall order, and the scandall, which might haue followed thereupon; as the censures which wee now vse against these, that refuse to performe the diuine seruice appoynted to be done on these times, are not inflicted for any fault that is in omission, in regard of the time, but onely in regard of the order and policie of the Church, which being contemned, giues offence to the simple, and breaks peace and vnitie. Fiftly, we neuer abiured with oathes publique or priuate, the obseruation now required; the dedication of dayes imposed vpon the conscience, with opinion that they are sanctiores, & sacratiores alijs diebus, & pars diuini cultus, we detest, and abiure: for nothing can be imposed vpon the conscience, but by the precept of God onely. The Canons of the Church in matters indifferent, doe not oblige the conscience ratione rei praeceptae quasi pars sit aliqua diuini cultus: sed ordinis & politias causa tantum. So the Canons of the Church made for obseruation of these fiue dayes, bindes not the conscience to the obseruation thereof, as a part of diuine worship, and as the commaundement of God bindes vs to the obseruation of the Lords Day: for it is the will of God, that on the Lords Day, we be religiously exercised, and therefore our obedience in that point, is a part of his worship: but to be exercised in Gods publique worship on another day, is not Gods expresse will, yet it is his will, that we should heare the Church, and obey her ordinances in all things that tend to edification, and serue for good order, whereof God is the Author. To conclude, seeing the obseruation of these fiue daies, as the same is prescribed in the act at Perthe, is neither contrarie to any Law, Ciuill, or Ecclesiastique; nor condemned by the practice, doctrine, and censures of our Church, nor abiured by oathes: And therefore may lawfully be restored, receiued, and put in practise againe by our Church.

                  Ye may not pleade, because the change is alreadie made in a lawfull Assembly, which had power to abrogate all Statutes of Ecclesiasticall matters, that are found noysome, vnprofitable, disagreeing with the time, and abused by the people: as is set down in the confession of Faith, and seuenth Chapter of the Booke of Discipline, concluded anno 1581. Such were the acts made before concerning Holy-dayes: for first, they were noysome, in that they were not conforme to the practise of the Primitiue Church, or yet of the later reformed, and so in that poynt did break vnitie. Next, vnprofitable, because they fostered prophanenesse and superstition in the hearts of the people, who by want of information of Doctrine, did superstitiously or prophanely obserue these dayes. Thirdly, they agreed not with this time, wherein it was expedient that the religious Commemoration of the benefits of Christ should be restored iur

Last of all, the discharge of diuine Seruice, on these daies was come into abuse amongst the people, the preciser sort counting it a part of Gods worship, and obedience to his will, not to doe seruice vnto God on these dayes; and the profane taking thereby occasion to be more licentious: And therefore it was needfull in a manner to restore the obseruation of these times.

                  It is true, that in the Churches of Bearne, Mattins and Euening-Song were abolished for the abuse thereof in Poperie; and not many yeares since, there was great contention before these Churches could be induced to receiue Morning and Euening Prayers in stead of them. So the Popes cursing was abolished out of the Church of Geneua, and

great contradiction made, as Beza testifies in Caluines life, before excommunication could be established in place therof: yet I hope, neither Zanchius, nor your selfe will thinke that the reinducing of these was vnlawfull, although formerly excluded. If Zanchius vnderstood the case of our Church, as I haue set it down a little before, & how, we haue not reinduced the Popish obseruation of dayes, but made choice of these times for special seruices to be performed on them, with a speciall direction to Ministers to rebuke superstition, and licentiousnesse; both he, and other Diuines would approue the constitution of our Church, and condemne this your seditious Pamphlet, whereby the simple are abused, and the peace and quietnesse of our Church disturbed.

                     OF the ancient Church I haue spoken before. Some excuse the Ancients with good intention, because to winne the Gentiles, they conuerted their dayes into Christian Holy-daies. Others excuse them with the circumstance of time, that dwelling amongst Pagans, they made profession before their eies of Christs birth, passion, &c. by obseruing such dayes. But the wisdome of their intention hath proued folly, as the seuenth reason maketh manifest. The like circumstance of time is not offered: therefore we may not be excused.

his cred

                     te, why he reiects the doctrine and practise of the reformed Church, which stands wholly in his contrarie. First he sayes, that he hath spoken before of the Ancient Church. But what hath he spoken before? that they obserued Easterday by custome, and not by tradition, this is all. What argument hath he brought against their doctrine, against their religious custome and practise of this poynt? He sayes, some excuse them with their intention: Who be these? he is ashamed of their names, and so he may be; for where there is no fault, to make an excuse is a sort of calumnious and secret accusation. But for their intention, who did acquaint him with their intention? In Tertullian, Chrysostome, Ierome, Ambrose, Augustine, and others, who all make mention of these dayes, there is not so much as any coniecture to bee found for that intention. In the end he concludes, that the intention of the Ancients hath proued folly, and this he sayes, is manifest by the seuenth reason, because the obseruation of these daies hath beene abused to superstition. But so hath the Lords Day beene, so hath the Word, so haue the Sacraments beene abused, and all the other parts of Gods worship: Shall therefore the intention of the Holy-Ghost, and his wisdome in prescribing these meanes to the Church, be esteemed folly? They who abuse the good intention of God and his Church to their owne damnation, are fooles indeed, but Wisdom

And although the winning of the Gentiles was one good end, wherefore the Ancients obserued these dayes, yet their principall end was the honour of God, and edification of his Church. These ends doe still remaine, and iustifie the obseruation of these dayes by the reformed Churches, which no man that loues the honour of God, and the weale of his Church, will condemne.

                  It is grosse ignorance to say, that Holy-dayes were so many hundreth yeares before Papistrie: for Papistrie hath been in the Church euer since the daies of the Apostles: yea the

mysterie of iniquitie was working in their times. The errours of the Orthodoxe Church were the beginnings of the Papistrie, at length they grew to a great masse. So howbeit, the whole lumpe was not formed, till the Antichrist came to his full strength, yet many particulars were entered before, and like brookes came into the great riuer. As the Antichrist was borne, and did grow in yeares, so did Papistrie.

                  Here ye insinuate, that the obseruation of the fiue Daies in the Primitiue Church was Papistrie, or else this Discourse is idle. But Papistrie it could not be, before it was receiued, and confirmed by the Pope: so in these dayes it was not Papistrie formally. And if it were not an errour of the Orthodoxe Church, but a lawfull order, as at length we haue proued, it was neyther materially nor formally Papistrie. The obseruation of these dayes, with a superstitious and idolatrous worship, is Papistrie: Such was not the obseruation of the Primitiue Church, and such is not the obseruation of the Reformed. But as the lawfull obseruation vsed in the Primitiue Church was abolished by the introduction of a superstitious and idolatrous worship in Papistrie, so is the superstitious and idolatrous obseruation in Papistrie, abolished in reformed Churches by the restitution of the lawfull and religious obseruation vsed in the Primitiue Church, which of all reformations is the most perfect and profitable. Iehu abolished Idolatrie of the Heathen, but he restored not the true worship of God: therefore his reformation was imperfect. But the reformation made by Ezechias, and Iosias, was perfect, because Idolatrie was not onely abolished, but the true worship of God established in place thereof. This was not so sufficiently prouided for at our reformation in this poynt, for the want of Pastours, and is well supplied by the Act made at Perth.

                  Now yee come to the iudgement of the reformed Churches. And here I wish the iuducious Reader to obserue whether ye bring either the iudgement of any reformed Church, or of any learned Diuine, that consents with you in opinion; namely, that the obseruation of the fiue anniuersarie dayes with the lawfull exercise of true Religion, is a Iudaicall Pedagogie, a rudimentarie instruction, and a superstitious wil-worship. And to the end all that ye say may be exposed to the view of the World, I shall set all fully downe which yee bring to this purpose.
                  First, where ye alledge, that all the reformed Churches, haue abandoned the dayes dedicated to Saints: In this, their practise is no way contrarie to the Act made at Perth; for by it no day is ordained to be kept, which is or was dedicate to any Saint, except vnder the name of Saints yee reprehend him, who is the most holy.
                  Next, the exception ye make of our neighbour Church, is calumnious, and false. It is a calumnie, that they obserue any day dedicated to Saints. All the dayes which they obserue, are dedicated to the honour of God, either for the inestimable benefits that by our Sauiour he hath bestowed vpon the World, or in regard of the blessings that haue come to man, by the Ministrie of his seruants, and Saints. And it is false, that all the reformed Churches, except they, haue refused the obseruation of these dayes: For Bullinger in his Commentary vpon the 14. to the Romans, affirmes, that the Church of Tigurie obserues the Feasts of the blessed Virgin, of S. Iohn the Baptist, of Magdalene, of Stephen, and of the Apostles.
               
               
                  PP.
                  Some admit dayes dedicated to Christ, some two, some fiue; but not with the full consent and liking of the learned, but either forced by the authoritie of the Magistrate or wilfulnesse of the people, or because remaining in the middest of their enemies, they are not permitted otherwise to doe.

                  They in Geneua who obserue the day of Natiuitie, and Easter, approue the practise and order of the Church of Heluetia, who obserue all the fiue: and there is as great reason, why on the other three dayes, the Passion, Ascension, and sending downe of the holy Ghost, should be remembred as the Natiuitie, and Resurrection. If by the learned ye vnderstand these whom ye doe afterwards name Farellus, Viret, and Caluine: I am perswaded no man will thinke, that either they or any other such Pastors of the Church would haue bin forced to practise that which was vnlawfull in it selfe, and a superstitious will-worship, either by Magistrate, or People.

                     Farellus and Viret remooued all Holy-dayes out of the Church of Geneua, as Caluine testifies. The same decree, which banished Farellus and Caluine out of Geneua, brought in other Holy-dayes. They were all againe abrogate, except the Sabbath day: Howsoeuer after, came in the keeping of Pasche, and the Natiuitie.

Epistle, where he professes, that it was done se inscio, ac ne optante quidem. And a little after subioynes, Ex quo sum reuocatus, hoc temperamentum quaesiui, vt Christi Natalis celebraretur vestro more, alijs autem diebus extraordinariae supplicationes tab

And albeit in that place, he confesses, that the abrogation of the Festiuall dayes did not grieue him, yet he protests as followes, Hoc tamen testatum esse volo, si mihi delata optio fuisset, quod nunc constitutū est, non fuisse pro sentētia dicturum. If Caluine had thought as ye doe, that December Christmas is a iust imitation of December Saturnall of the Ethnicke Romanes, and that the obseruation of the rest of the Festiuall dayes, had beene a superstitious kinde of Will-worship, and a Iudaicall Pedagogie he would neuer haue

consented to the keeping of that Natiuitie; and would not only haue abolished the holy dayes by his suffrage, if the same had beene in his option, but also testified to the world his dislike of them by his Pen, and writing. But, that all may see, how different his iudgement is from yours, he concludes with these words: Nec tamen est, cur homines adeo exasperentur, si libertate nostra, vt Ecclesiae aedificatio postulat, vt

                        mur: quemadmodum nec vicissim praeiudicio esse morem nostrum aequum est: By these words it is manifest, that in Caluines iudgement, the obseruation, and abrogation of these dayes consists in the power and libertie of the Church; and that the obseruation of them in it selfe, is not vnlawfull, but a thing indifferent, to be vsed, and not vsed, as the edification of the Church requires; which iudgement wee imbrace and follow.

                  The Belgike Churches in their Synode holden at Dort, Anno, 1578. wished that only the Lords Day might be celebrated. Luther himselfe in his Booke De bonis Operibus, set forth, Anno, 1520. wished that there were no Feast Dayes amongst Christians, but the Lords Day. And in his Booke to the Nobilitie of Germany, he sayes, Consultum esse, vt omnia festa aboleantur, solo dic Dominico retento.

                  This wish, Luther, and the Belgike Churches conceiued out of their miscontentment at the number, corruptions, and superstitions of the Festiuall dayes, besides the Lords Day, as ye doe. The late Councell holden at Dort, Anno
                     
1618. did celebrate the Feast of Christs Natiuitie most solemnely for the space of three dayes: so the practise of these Churches and of Luther shewes that they agree in iudgment with vs touching the obseruation of the fiue dayes.

Where yee say, that they neuer aduised Churches to resume them, who had once remooued the same, Caluine in his one and fiftieth Epistle aduises the Monbelgardens not to contend against the Prince for not resuming of all Festiuall dayes, but only such as serued not to edification, and were seene to be superstitious, such as the Conception and Assumption of the blessed Virgin: In festis non recipiendis (sayes hee) cuperem vos esse constantiores, sic tamen, vt non litigetis de quibuslibet, sed de eis tantum quae nec ad aedificationem quicquam factura sunt, & supertitionem prima ipsa facie prae se ferunt, &c. And in the end of the Epistle, answering one Obiection, which is frequently vsed in our Church, he saies; Quod autem vos terret offendiculorum periculum, si quam nouam agendi formam receperitis, quae non sit nostris Ecclesiis vsitata, id quidem meritò facitis: Sed quia non eò ventum est perfectionis, quin optemus adhuc progredi, hic timor vos impedire non debet ab ijs ritibus admittendis, quos alioqui non liceat penitus improbare. What these Ceremonies were, whereof he speakes, ye will find in the same Epistle, to wit, the administration of the Communion to the sicke, and to persons who are to suffer; Baptisme by Mid-wiues, which

simply condemnes, Rites in buriall of the dead, and Festiual dayes which they were vrged by the Prince to resume, after they had beene remoued from amongst them. But this and such other peaceable and modest aduices giuen by Caluine, and other Learned Diuines, yee ascribe to want of consideration.

And as long as it shall please almighty God to blesse vs with the continuance of his Maiesties most happy Gouernment, wee are assured to be preserued from Heresie, Superstition, Idolatry, and such like corruptions. I beseech God, that our ingratitude, murmuring, grudging, suspitions, and misconstructions, doe not prouoke God to stop the breath of our nostrils, and remooue the Lords Annointed, vnder whose shaddow wee haue enioyed peace and quietnesse aboue all the Nations that are about vs.

                  To conclude then, to esteeme one day aboue another, in respect of any mystery, certainly knowne, or commonly reputed to haue beene wrought vpon that day; to testifie this estimation, by cessation from worke: To deuise a particular seruice to be done vpon it, accounting that forme or part of seruice acceptable to God, because it is performed on that day: is to obserue a day. And in this manner doe wee obserue the Anniuersarie dayes. The same reason may bee applyed to an Anniuersary houre.
               
               
                  ANS.
                  The Proposition I admit, the Assumption I deny: for albeit any mysticall or memorable worke were certainly knowne to haue beene wrought vpon such a time, yet to esteeme aboue another, except it were sanctified by diuine Institution, wee count it Superstition. So albeit wee certainly know the memorable workes of his Maiesties deliuerance

to haue beene wrought vpon the fift of August, and the fift of Nouember; yet we doe not esteeme these dayes aboue other dayes, as if the seruice done on them, were more acceptable to God, in respect of the time: but wee doe only esteeme them as meete circumstances for the thankesgiuing appointed to be made on them to God. The same estimation we haue of the fiue dayes, as wee haue oft said before.
                  That our Sauiour was borne vpon the 25. of December, no man (I thinke) knowes certainly: the common reputation we hold as vncertaine. Therefore wee doe not thinke, the commemoration of Christs Natiuitie vpon that day, and our thankesgiuing therefore more acceptable to God by reason of the day; nor doe wee thinke cessation from worke on that day a part of diuine worship, at it was held in time of Papistry, and is yet by many of our common Professours that lacke instruction: but the worship we doe, in vnto God for his honour, not for the day; and the cessation from work is for the commoditie, and celebritie of the worship. The Act of Perth ordaynes the people to be thus instructed, and the superstitious conceite of the time rebuked. Finally, choice is made of this, and the other dayes, not for any mysterie esteemed to bee in them more then in other dayes, but for conformity with the Primitiue Church, the reuerence of whose authoritie in matters of this nature, must be of great force to draw Churches of diuers iurisdictions that agree in doctrine, to vnity in points of externall policie: which vnity is far to be preferred to the priuate custome of any Church, or the singularity of any mans opinion and fantasie. And therefore ZANCHIVS said well, and wisely in the places cited before, That albeit the reformed Churches haue liberty to sanctifie what dayes they thinke good, yet it is more laudable, honest, and profitable, to sanctifie these which the most pure, Apostolick, and Primitiue Church sanctified. So to conclude, we obserue no day for mystery, or with opinion of necessitie, but only for commodity and policie. And this obseruation is approued by the iudgement of the best Diuines in the reformed Church.

               ECclesiasticall obseruation of time, is when set dayes are obserued for orders sake, that men might come together to worship God. These dayes are eyther dayes of thankesgiuing, or dayes of humiliation: take the example of the Iewes, Ester 9.26. Who obserued yeerely the Feast of Purim, for a memory of their deliuerance. In like manner, they obserued the Feast of Dedication, and it seemes, that Christ was present at Ierusalem as an obseruer of this Feast, Iohn 10.22. And thus for orders sake to obserue certayne dayes of Solemnity, is not forbidden.
            
            
               WILLET in his six-fold Commentarie vpon the fourteenth to the ROMANS.
               THe Apostle reproues them for the superstitious obseruing of dayes, such as then the Iewes practised, and now the Papists: but to obserue such Holy dayes as God hath appointed, such as the Sabbath, and others for

order and policie, not for Religions sake, is not within the Apostles reprehension. Item, The Apostle speakes of the Iewes Festiuals, wherein they did clogge their consciences, and one iudged another; not of the Lords Day, which is of Christs appointing, and of other Festiuals for Order and Policie, and not for a part of the Seruice of God, to bind the Conscience.
            
         
         
            
            An answere to the dispute, intituled, OF CONFIRMATION, and of Bishopping. Wherein the Pamphlet penner pretends to impugne the third Article, concluded in the Assembly at Perth, touching the triall of young childrens education; the tenor whereof followes.
            
               
                  FOr as much as one of the most speciall meanes for staying the encrease of Popery, and setling of true Religion in the hearts of the people, is, that a speciall care be taken in triall of young children their education, and how they are catechized: which in time of the primitiue Church was most carefully attended, as being most profitable to cause young children, in their tender yeares, drinke in the knowledge of God and his Religion, but is now altogether neglected in respect of the great abuse and errors, which crept into the Popish Church, by making thereof a Sacrament of Confirmation: Therefore, that all superstitions built thereupon may be rescinded, and that the matter it selfe being most necessary for the education of the youth, may be reduced to the primitiue integritie, it is thought good, that the Minister in euery Parish shall catechize all young children of eight yeares of age, and see that they haue the knowledge and bee able to make rehearsall of the Lords prayer, Beliefe, and ten Commandements, with answers to the questions of the small Catechisme vsed in our Church:

And that euery Bishop in his Visitation shall censure the Minister, who shall be found remisse therein: And the said Bishops shall cause the said children to be presented before them, and blesse them with prayer for the encrease of their knowledge, and continuance of Gods heauenly graces with euery one of them.
            
            In the narratiue of this Act, the Sacrament of Confirmation is counted amongst the abuses, errors, and superstitions, which crept into the Papistical Church in stead of the profita
                  •
               le catechizing, that the primitiue Church vsed for the t

               iall of you
                  •
               g childrens education: therefore the first part of the dispute, wherein the Pamphleter intends to prooue that Confirmation is not a Sacrament, contayning nothing that is contrary to the Act, shall be passed by.
            In the second part of the dispute, intituled, Bishopping, he contends that the Sacrament of Confirmation and imposition of hands, is not proper to Bishops, but common to all Presbyters. This contention is idle: for the Sacrament of Confirmation and imposition of hands, being refuted in the former dispute by himselfe, and condemned by the Act, why should hee striue to haue that common, which neither he nor we esteeme to be lawfull? But to the end, all occasion of debate, about this matter might be preuented, the Assembly at Perth ordayned, that the Bishop after examination should blesse the young children with prayer, and purposely omitted the ceremonie of imposition of hands, as a thing indifferent to bee vsed, or not vsed, as the Bishop should thinke most meet: Albeit in the primitiue Church, this blessing was alwayes giuen with imposition of hands,as Caluine affirmes, Instit. lib. 4. sect. 4. wishing that it were restored to the first integritie in the reformed Churches. Yet the Pamphleter to make simple ones beleeue, that euery thing concluded in that Assembly was erroneous, hee giues out, that the Sacrament, at least the ceremonie of Confirmation was there allowed, and appropriated to Bishops.
            
               PP.
               We haue abjured Episcopall gouernment, and therefore

we cannot lawfully admit Episcopall Confirmation▪ giuing, and not granting their office were lawfull, and that they haue gotten a lawfull calling by the Church to the said office. Thirdly, that we were free of our oath: and fourthly, That Confirmation were to be allowed, whether as a Ceremonie or as a Sacrament, yet it is damnable presumption, to appropriate vnto themselues the dutie that belongs to all Pastors.
            
            
               ANS.
               If by the Ceremonie or Sacrament of Confirmation, yee vnderstand the miraculous imposition of hands vsed by the Apostles, or yet the bastard Sacrament of Confirmation vsed in Poperie, whereby Bellarmine, whom yee afterwards cite, sayes, That the Lord would honour Episcopalem dignitatem: neither of these are allowed by the Act, nor appropriated to Bishops. Therefore, your whole dispute following being directed onely against these two points, is idle & superfluous. But if by Confirmation ye did vnderstand according to the meaning of the Act, the dutie which Bishops should performe in trying at their Visitation, the diligence of Pastors in catechizing young children, and in causing them bee brought before them to bee examined and blessed: this part of Episcopall gouernment yee haue not abjured, but haue approued by your assertorie oath, and obliged your selfe to maintayne and obey by your promissorie oath; if so bee, yee did sweare to the Policie set downe in the first booke of Discipline, Anno 1560. as yee haue often professed. For the wordes in that booke touching this point of Bishops dutie, are these:
               
                  After the Superintendents haue remayned in their chiefe Townes, three or foure moneths at the most, they shall be compelled (vnlesse by sicknesse onely they be retayned) to re-enter in their Visitation. In which they shall not onely preach, but also examine the life, diligence, and behauiour of the Ministers, as also the order of their Churches, and manners of their people:

They must further consider, how the poore are prouided for, and the youth instructed.
               
               By these wordes it is manifest, that it was not a thing common to euery Pastor to visite Churches, and trie the diligence of Ministers, specially concerning their instruction of the youth, but that it was proper to the Superintendent. Now, if yee haue sworne that this is lawfull in the person of the Superintendent, how can yee call it a damnable presumption in the person of a Bishop? whose function and name is the same, differing onely in the origination of the word, the one being drawne from the Latine, the other from the Greeke: for a Bishop in the Greeke tongue is the same that a Superintendent is in the Latine. And in visiting of Churches, the triall of the education of children, which now is a dutie belonging to the Bishops function, is here set downe as a speciall point of the Superintendents office.
               As to the blessing which the Bishop is appointed to giue vnto them, Caluine in the place aboue cited, sayes, That it should bee vsed to the end, that graue and sacred action, may haue the greater reuerence and dignitie. This examination of children, in the ancient Church, had ioyned with it, not the blessing onely, but the ceremonie also of imposition of hands; and thereupon in the fourth Councell of Carthage, Can. 85. It is called, Examinatio impositionis manus, and is appointed to be often vsed towards the Catechumenists before they were baptised. But this blessing and imposition of hands vpon the Catechumenists, and vpon the young children of Christians, was not the principall action, nor a Sacramentall rite, as it was after esteemed; nor giuen to Bishops for honour of their Episcopall dignitie, but accessorie onely, as Caluine rightly thinks, vnto the examination, which was the Bishops speciall dutie in his Visitation. It is true, the omission of the principall dutie, and the vsing onely of the accessorie, to wit, the imposition

of hands, was the first corruption, that crept in: after that came in the crossing, the annointing of the forehead and the buffet giuen to the child in stead of the blessing, and so a Bastard Sacrament was instituted in the place of a most profitable point of the Episcopall function. Further, as it is the dutie of euery Pastor, to catechize the young children in his Parish, and try whether the Parents haue kept their promise made at the Baptisme of their Children, in which tryall, if hee shall finde the childe to haue profited well, hee ought to blesse and pray for them: So is it the Bishops dutie in his Visitation to try if the Pastors haue performed their parts, and after examination, to blesse these same children. And as the examination, and blessing vsed by the Pastor, takes not away the power, that parents haue to examine and blesse their owne children; so the examination and blessing of Bishops takes not away the power that Pastors haue of triall, and blessing within their owne Parish. Therefore to conclude, the Ordinance set downe in the Act of Perth appropriates nothing to Bishops, that is common to Pastors and Parents, but preserues vnto euery one the prerogatiue of his owne calling: Neither is there any thing ordayned in the Act, but that which Caluine wished earnestly to be restored againe in the Church.
               In the fourth booke of his Institutions, cap. 29. sect. 4. & 13. De Confirmatione, hee writes as followes. Hic mos olim fuit, vt Christianorum liberi postquam adoleuerant, coram Episcopo sisterentur, vt officium illud implerent quod ab ijs exigebatur, qui se ad Baptismum adulti offerebant: hi enim inter Catechumenos sedebant, donec ritè fidei mysterijs instituti, poterant fidei confessionem coram Episcopo, ac populo edere.

Talem ergo manuum impositionem, quae simpliciter loco benedictionis fiat laudo, & restitutam hodie in purum vsum velim: that is to say, It was the custome of old, that the children of Christians, after they were growne vp to some perfection, were brought vnto the Bishop to performe that dutie which was done by these that were of perfit yeares, before they came to be baptised For these sate amongst the Catechumenists, while they were sufficiently instructed in the mysteries of Religion, and were able to giue a confession of their Faith before the Bishop and the People. But such as were baptised in their infancy, because they had not giuen a confession of their Faith vnto the Church, about the end of their childhood they were presented by their Parents of new, and examined by the Bishop according to a certayne common forme of Catechisme, which they had in these times. And to the end, this action, that was in it selfe graue and holy, might haue the greater reuerence and dignitie, the ceremonie of imposition of hands was also vsed. Thus the child after approbation of his Faith, was dimitted with a blessing, &c. Such an imposition of hands which is vsed for a simple blessing, I commend, doe and wish the sincere vse thereof were restored.

                      esset quaedam velut methodus doctrinae Christianae: that is, Would to God, we did obserue the custome, which I shew, the Ancients vsed: For then (Confirmation) should not be such as the Papists fancie, which cannot be once named without the injurie of Baptisme, but it should be a catechizing of children, whereby they should giue account of their Faith before the Church. And the best manner of catechizing were this; That a forme should be penned for that vse, contayning the summe of all the heads of our Religion, and expounding them familiarly, vnto which Faith and Religion the vniuersall Church of the faithfull should agree: that the child being ten yeares old, should present himselfe to the Church, to giue a confession of his Faith: bee demanded vpon euery Article, and made to answere seuerally to euery one: and if hee were ignorant of any point, or did not well vnderstand the same, he should be instructed. Thus he should in presence of the Church, and vnder the testimonie thereof make profession of that onely true and sincere Faith, wherewith the Congregation of the faithfull worships God. If this discipline were in vigour at this time, the slouth of some Parents should bee corrected that securely neglect the instruction of their children, as a thing not appertayning vnto

to them, which then without a publike shame they could not leaue vndone: a greater consent should bee amongst Christian people in Religion, and the ignorance of many should be nothing so great: some would not bee so hastily carried away with new and strange opinions, and in a word, all should haue a methode of Christian Doctrine. This was the minde of the most learned and worthy Diuine that hath liued in this last age, wherewith, let the Reader iudge, if the Ordinance of Perth bee not agreeing.
            
         
         
            
            An answer to the last head, intituled, Of the Administration of the Sacraments in priuate places.
            
               TO the end the last Controuersie touching the administration of Baptisme, and the Supper of the Lord in priuate houses, may bee the better discussed, wee shall premit some few grounds for cleering the question.
            First, The publike actions of Christian Religion, are not tyed to any certayne time, or place by diuine Institution, but may bee lawfully performed at any time, and in any place, when necess
                  •
               ty requires.
            Secondly, That the publike actions may be lawfully performed, a publike Minister, a lawfull Assembly, and the forme prescribed in the Word, must necessarily be kept.
            Thirdly, Howbeit some hold, that Baptisme ministred by a priuate person is valide, and effectuall, yet no man can hold truely, that it is lawfully ministred by such a person.
            Fourthly, Although the Communion Elements bee duly consecrated by a publike Minister in a most solemne and lawfull Assembly, yet if he apply them only to his owne priuate vse, or to so me other particular person, making no distribution according to the Institution, the action is not lawfully performed.
            Fiftly, The lawfull Assemblies, wherein the publike actions

may be performed, are eyther ordinary, or not ordinarie. The ordinary are not defined in the word particularly, but are left to bee determined by the Church, which according to the generall Rules of Christian Policie, hath deuided the Christian people in sundry Congregations called Parishes; whose meeting in the ordinary times and places appointed, are the ordinary Assemblies, wherein the publike actions of Religion should be performed ordinarily.
            Sixtly, The Assemblies that are lawfull, but not ordinary, are the meetings of two, or three at least in the Name of Iesus Christ, wherein he hath promised his presence to heare their Prayers, and approue their lawfull actions of piety. In such Assemblies, the Word hath beene preached, and Baptisme ministred, as in the 16. of the Acts, the Master of the Prison, and his Family were baptized by Paul. The Husband, the Wife, and a Seruant make a Family, where there be no more. The Family of Priscilla and Aquila, are called a Church. This Pamphleter affirmes with Saint Augustine, Paulinus, Esychius, Theophylactus, and others, That our Sauiour at Emaus, did celebrate the Sacrament to the two Disciples, with whom he communed in the way. There the whole Assembly were but three: whether the Sacrament was ministred, or not at that time, this is certaine; as many as hold, that the same was celebrated, must also hold, that three make the bodie of a Church, wherein the Eucharist may be lawfully ministred: and if the Eucharist, much more Baptisme, which was ministred by Philip to the Eunuch, where there was no Christian Assembly conuened. Yet doubtlesse, he was baptised in presence of his Seruants who were witnesses to the action. For Baptisme would be ministred in presence of some witnesses, and the Eucharist cannot be lawfully ministred without some communicants. Although a Temple bee not necessary, at Caluine sayes in the 185. Epistle, yet the Infant should be baptized in coetu aliquo. Si enim infans clam baptizetur, nullis adhibitis testibus,

illud ne
                     
                        
                     
                     que
                   respondet ordini à Domino posito, ne
                     
                        
                     
                     que
                   Apostolorum exemplo: Likewise that there may bee a Communion, conueniat coetus aliquis ex cognatis, familiaribus, & vicinis, saies Caluine. These grounds being warranted by Scripture, and by the Ancients; first, wee shall set downe the Acts of the Assembly, which yee labour to refute, next your Refutation and Answere thereto.
            
               The Acts concluded at Perth, touching priuate Baptisme, and Communion.
               THe Minister shall often admonish the people, that they deferre not the baptizing of Infants any longer, then the nexts Lords Day after the Childe bee borne, vnlesse vpon a great and reasonable cause declared to the Minister, and by him approued. As also they shall warne them, that without great cause, they procure not their Children to be baptized at home in their houses, but when great need shall compell them to baptise in priuate houses (in which case, the Minister shall not refuse to doe it vpon the knowledge of the great need, and being timely required thereto) then Baptisme shall be administred after the same forme, as it should haue beene in the Congregation. And the Minister shall, the next Lords Day after any such priuate Baptisme, declare in the Church; that the Infant was so baptized, and therefore ought to bee receiued as one of the true Flocke of Christs Fold.
               
                  Item, If any good Christian visited with long sicknesse, and knowne to the Pastor, by reason of his present infirmity vnable to resort to the Church for receiuing of the

holy Communion, or being sick, stall declare to the Pastor vpon his cōscience, that he thinks his sicknes to be deadly, and shall earnestly desire to receiue the same in his house: The Minister shall not deny to him so great a comfort, lawfull warning being giuen to him vpon the night before, and that there be three or foure of good Religion and conuersation, free of lawfull impediments, present with the sicke person to communicate with him, who must also prouide a conuenient place in his house, & all things necessary for the reuerend administration thereof, according to the order prescribed in the Church.
               
                  PP.
                  In the ninth head of the first Booke of Discipline, it was thought expedient, that Baptisme should be ministred, vpon the ordinary dayes of preaching, not that it is vnlawfull to baptise, whensoeuer the Word is preached: but to remoue a grosse errour, wherewith many are deceiued, thinking that Children bee damned, if they dye without Baptisme, &c. In the order of Baptisme set downe before the Psalmes in metre, it is said, that the Sacraments are not ordayned of God to bee vsed in priuate corners, as Charmes, or Sorceries, &c. And in the Assembly holden, 1581. it was ordayned that the Sacraments, should not bee ministred in priuate houses, &c. This laudable order hitherto obserued was altered, &c.
               
               
                  ANS.
                  Cases of necessitie are not subiect to ordinarie rules: Therfore the Acts made at Perth concerning necessary and extraordinarie cases, alters not the laudable order hitherto obserued. As it is an errour, to esteeme Baptisme absolutely necessary, that is, a middest without which there is no saluation:

so it is as great an errour not to thinke it necessary, as an ordinary meane, whereby the Grace of God is communicate, and without the which, if it may be had, and be either contemned or neglected, there is no certainty that God will conferre his grace. Therefore to astrict the ministration of Baptisme to a humane order, touching time and place, which by the Word of God may be lawfully vsed at other times, and in other places, is great temeritie, importing to the Childe, no small danger of the losse of grace, and bringing vpon the Parent and Pastor the guilt of his bloud for contemning, at lest neglecting the ordinary meane of saluation.
               
               
                  PP.
                  A Sacrament is a publike action, to bee performed publikely, by publike Ministers: Neyther can any necessitie, or sufficient cause be alleadged, wherefore any sacred and publike action should passe in priuate: because Gods Ordinance is to vs a supreme Law and necessitie, which we ought to obey rather, then foster popular ignorance and infirmitie. These are Tilenus words.
               
               
                  ANS.
                  These words are not vttered by Tilenus against the administration of Baptisme, at extraordinary times, and in extraordinary places: but only against the administration of Baptisme by women, and priuate persons; which is the second Controuersie in Baptisme which hee handles, beginning at the twelfth position, with these words, Altera Controuersia de Ministro Baptismi, and ending at the eighteenth These. Where there is not so much as a syllable of the time, and place, when, and where Baptisme may be ministred: all his positions concerning only the persons by whom. So in this yee are like your selfe, peruerting, and abusing the speeches of learned men against their owne minde. And it is to bee obserued heere, that yee peruersly interpret his words: for where he sayes, Nulla
                           
                              
                           
                           que
                         necessitas vel idonea causa afferri potest,

cur actio sacra, & publica transeat in priuatam: yee, to make the Reader beleeue that Tilenus speakes of a priuate place, whiles he is speaking of a priuate action, translate it (passe in priuate) as if a publike action could not be lawfully performed, when it is done by a publike person, and in presence of such a number, as by the Ordinance of God are sufficient.
               
               
                  PP.
                  The Sacraments are testimonies of our pietie, thankfulnesse, profession, and protestations of our saith: therefore they ought to be conspicuous, and publike.
               
               
                  ANS.
                  It is most expedient, that they bee both conspicuous and publike, but in cases of necessity, it suffices that they bee publike.
               
               
                  PP.
                  We haue no externall fellowship with the whole Church militant, in the publike exercise of Religion, but a mediate Communion with a particular Congregation. This Communion ought not to be violated.
               
               
                  ANS.
                  This Communion is not violated, when in cases of necessitie men cannot resort to the Parish Church. If we communicate in these exercises of Religion with two or three conuened in the Name of Christ, where a greater Assembly cannot be had, our Communion with the Church is not violated: for they are a particular Church, and a part of the vniuersall, aswell as the Parishioners, although they be lesse.
               
               
                  PP.
                  The Sacraments should be ministred with consent, and in presence of the Church; seeing they are workes of publike nature, and of publike fruit belonging to all.
               
               
                  ANS.
                  Such workes of publike nature, and publike fruit ought ordinarily to be ministred solemnely: but in cases of necessitie,

it suffices that they bee lawfully ministred in caetu aliquo fidelium, as Caluine speakes, Epist. 185.
               
               
                  PP.
                  The Sacraments ministred in priuate houses, make the Sacraments to be contemned, and neglected. Heretickes take occasion to corrupt the pure administration of them by these priuie practises. The imperiall constitution in Iustinian forbiddeth that holy things be ministred in priuate houses.
               
               
                  ANS.
                  The lawfull administration prescribed in the Act preserues them from contempt, neglect, and corruption: And by the contrarie, the omission of the Sacraments in the cases of necessitie, make men to contemne, and neglect them as vnnecessarie. For Heretickes, there is nothing so good, at which they will not take occasion of euill, yet the practise of good things must not therefore be omitted. To Iustinians constitutions, ye were wont to answere, that the Lawes of the Code are not rules of Theologie: O, but this is a constitution of the Nouels: that is true, yet it fauours your nouelties no more then the Code. This constitution forbiddes onely the ordinarie exercises of publique worship, in priuate Oratories, whereby the Temples were deserted, as is manifest by the Preface: but it is so farre from forbidding the celebration of the Sacraments in priuate houses, in cases of necessitie, that it reserueth priuiledge to the Patriarch of Constan

                  PP.
                  The Sacraments are not tyed to the materiall Churches made of dead stones, but the Church made of liuely stones. If

                  Yet here the whole Congregation is not an ordinarie Parishionall Church, but an extraordinarie Conuention, wherein we affirme with you, that the Sacraments may and should be ministred. In this we agree, but in that which followes of the number which may make a Congregation, we disagree.
               
               
                  PP.
                  Christ promise to be in the middest of two or three conuened in his name, cannot be extended to the administration of the Sacraments: for then, where two onely are conuened, the Communion might be ministred, and so the priuat Masse defended. Christ reasons onely from the lesse to the more: If he wil heare the prayers, and ratifie the censures of two or three, farre more of the whole Church.

                  If the lesse be true, namely, that Christ will ratifie the Censures of two or three conuened in his name, then two or three conuened in his name, must make a lawfull Church, that hath power to censure and excommunicate such as are subiect to their iurisdiction; otherwise Christ would not haue promised to ratifie their censure. As to the Masse, it is not a priuate Masse, where distribution is made, but where the Priest receiues alone: otherwise ye must graunt, that it was a priuate Masse, that Christ celebrated at Emmaus, where two onely did participate and receiue from our Sauiour. In a word, if in Christs promise the number bee not defined, which at the least may make a Church wherein the publique actions of Religion ought to be performed, since it is no where else defined in Scripture, it must be left to the determination of the Church, which hath power to define what the least number is, that may make a lawfull extraordinarie conuention, aswell as to diuide a Nationall Church in Di

                  PP.
                  Baptisme is a ceremonie initiatorie of our entrance into the bosome of some visible Congregation, or (as Caluine sayes) It is a sacred and solemne introduction into the Church of God, and is a testimonie of our heauenly Burgesship, in which they are written vp, whom hee adopteth to himselfe. It ought therefore to be publique.

                     Caluine in the Epistle which ye quote the 185. sayes not, that therefore it ought to be in a Parishionall Church, but that it behoues the Infant, baptizari in coetu aliquo: and expresly, non quidem vt templum requiratur, Sed vt vbiuis numerus aliquis fidelium conuenia

                  PP.
                  Baptisme is a signe of Christian Profession before the world, it ought therefore to be publique.

                  As it is impossible that it can be publike after such a manner as all the World may be witnesses thereto, so it is not absolutely necessarie that it bee before the whole Parish, when the Childe is in such extremitie that he cannot bee brought vnto the Church.

                  Ordinarily it ought to be publique, in presence of the Parishiones; the extraordinarie ministration serues for their comfort who are present. But if it were not ministred at all,

in time of necessitie, as ye would haue it, then all should bee depriued of that comfort, and the childe of the benefit of the ordinarie meane of Saluation.
               
               
                  PP.
                  Not onely the Parents, but the Church presents the Childe before God, and concurs with the Minister in prayer for the saluation of the Infant.

                  Priuate Baptisme hath sprung of the opinion of the necessitie of Baptisme, and doth still foster the same damnable opinion. In the ancient Church, two solemne times were appoynted for Baptisme, &c.

                  The opinion of absolute necessitie, ratione medij, that is, of a middest, without which the Infant cannot be saued, is not to be allowed, yet the opinion of necessitie, ratione praecepti, that is, of an ordinarie meane commaunded by God, to bee vsed, when and where it may be had, is sound. And in that opinion the people ought to be confirmed, and admonished (as it is in the act) Not to deferre the Baptisme of their Infants, nor neglect it: But to perswade the people, that it is not necessarie, as an ordinarie meane, is as great an errour as any yee alledge hath sprung of the opinion of absolute necessitie. These errours ought to be remoued, not by refusing Baptisme when it is required, which is a disobedience, no lesse dangerous then the errours are, but by the wholsome doctrine of the Word, which is the onely powerfull meane to abolish all errours in Religion.
               
               
                  PP.
                  In priuate Baptisme, the doctrine of Baptisme is omitted, for haste to saue the soule of the Infant as is thought, and so the Sacrament is not ministred according to the dignity of it:

and this hath bred a negligent ministration of Baptisme in publike. The Trullian Synod decreed, that Baptisme Nullatenus in no case be ministred in a priuate Oratorie. If it be done otherwise, let the Clergie-man be deposed, the Laickes excommunicate. If in no case, where was then the case of necessitie?

                  The necessarie Doctrine ought not to be omitted, and the act ordaines Baptisme in priuate houses to be ministred after the same forme that in the Congregation. Doctrine at the baptising of Infants, is not vsed for the instruction and comfort of the Infant, but for the instruction and comfort of the Parents and witnesses. Though it be abridged in times of extremitie, it diminishes not the dignitie of Baptisme, but the Sacrament is rather highly aduanced, when it is esteemed to be sufficient by it selfe as the ordinary meane of saluation to the infant. In the generall Councell of Constantinople, holden in the Emperour Constantinus his Palace in a roome called Trullus, two Canons are set downe, of which yee cite the 59. onely: forgetting▪ according to your custome, the Canon preceding touching Baptisme, the words whereof are these: Clericos, qui in Oratorijs quae sunt intra domos ministrant, v

                        l baptizant, hoc illius loci Episcopi sententia facere decernimus, qui hoc non sic seruauerit, deponatur. The Canon ordaines these that baptize in priuate Oratories, to doe it by the Bishops appoyntment. And that cited by you is not contradictorie to this, but concerneth the ordinarie administration of Baptisme, whereas vpon extraordinarie considerations of infirmitie, and inhabilitie of persons, the Councell acknowledges, that the same may be done vpon the Bishops speciall licence. So your Nullatenus includes not cases of necessitie. If the Bishop in such cases may permit Baptisme in priuate houses, much more might the Assembly at Perth, where so many Bishops and Pastors were present, set downe an ordinance to that effect.

No man will denie, but in the infancie of a Church, a priuate Baptisme may be tollerated: but we speake of a Church constituted, &c. The Lord appoynted a precise day of Circumcision, which might not be preuented. It was no wonder, if they had not euer opportunitie of a solemne Conuention, there is no precise day set downe for Baptisme, &c.

And that which is lawfull to be done, in the Infancie

of the Church, is yet lawfull to be done in a constituted Church, ratione reipraeceptae, & diuinae institutionis. And it is vnlawfull onely rati

Also, that which might haue beene tolerated in the infancie of the Church for necessitie, must euer be lawfull, in the like case: for it was not the infancie of the Church that made the toleration lawfull, but the necessitie. Where ye thinke, that the Iewes were more strictly obliged to circumcision, then Christians are to Baptisme, because a certain day was appointed for it, and to Baptisme there is no day prefixed in the Word: Wee know by the Law, that he who is not obliged at a certaine day to pay his debt, may be charged to pay it at all times, and therfore when God layes sicknesse on a child, a charge is giuen by God instantly to the Parent to performe his duetie.

                  The Lords Supper ought to be publique. We haue a spirituall vnion with the whole Church; but because it is not possible to celebrate a sacramentall communion with the whole Church militant, the Lord hath appointed vs to celebrate a sacramental cōmunion with some particular Church, We that are many are one bread, and one bodie, because wee are partakers of one bread, 1. Cor. 10.17. We cannot then bee one body sacramētally, except we be pertakers of one bread. Other Feasts may be priuate, in priuate houses, but the Lords Supper ought to be publique, 1. Cor. 11.12. When yee conuene to eate, tarrie one for another, 1. Cor. 11.33. Synaxis, a word signifying as much as Synagogue, was one of the names giuen of olde to this Sacrament.

                  As with the whole Church Militant we haue a spirituall Communion, so haue we an Euangelicall and Sacramentall Communion: for as we are partakers of the same spirit, so are we partakers of the same Word and Sacraments. The Bread is one, which all receiue, and the water one,

wherewith all are baptised Sacramentally; for they are clothed with the same sacred mysterie of signification, exhibition and obsignation of saluation in Christ crucified. When the Apostle sayes, 1. Cor. 10.17. Because the bread is one, we who are many are one body, for we are all partakers of one bread: he speaks not of our Communion with a particular Church onely, but with the Catholike; and by one bread he meanes not one bread mate

To bee short, wee haue no more a Sacramentall communion with these in the Parish, with whom wee communicate, then wee haue with the whole militant Church, who are all partakers of the same Sacraments. And thus, as we haue a spirituall, so we haue a sacramentall Communion with them. It is true, that our communion in the Word and Sacraments, is not visible, but with some particular Church, and therefore, as it is lesse or more publike, so is it lesse or more visible: yet we doe euer celebrate a Sacramentall communion with the whole Church, when the action is lawfully performed.

                  The Communion was sent to the sicke in the time, or mediately after the action, in Iustine Martyr his time. It became afterwards to bee reserued for the vse of dying persons, &c. Some put the Eucharist into the mouthes of the dead, lest they should want their voyage victuall. Yet in all Antiquitie we reade not, that the Communion was celebrated at the sick-mans bed-side.

                  The corruptions that haue flowed of mens erroneous conceit of the Sacraments, should not take away the lawfull vse of them when necessitie requires. As to the sending of the Sacrament to the sicke, it was a custome of the ancient Church, which Beza allowes: and where the Communion was daily, at least weekely, celebrated in the ordinarie Congregation, as that was the custome of those times, it was not necessarie to celebrate the Communion at the sick-mans bed-side.

                  Clinicall Communions haue not onely bred and still doe foster the opinion of absolute necessitie, but also of Opus operatum, of a preposterous confidence in the last voyage victuall, of coldnesse in the publike seruice of God when we are in health, of distrust of our saluation, if wee want it at that time. Caluine sayes, Difficillimum est hic cauere ne alios superstitio, alios ambitio, & vana ostentatio ad petendum sollicitet.

                  Albeit Caluine thinks, that Superstition, Ambition, and vaine glorie, may follow the practice of giuing the Communion to the sicke, yet hee concludes not as yee doe; For in the same Epistle, a little before the wordes which yee cite, hee sayes: Cur coenam aegrotis negandam esse non arbitrer, multae, & graues causae me impellunt: that is, Many great and weightie reasons moue mee to thinke, that the Communion ought not to be denyed to the sicke. Hee saw inc

                  Where yee alleadge Clinicall Communion, to haue bred the opinion of absolute necessitie, before yee said, that it was bred by misse-constructing of the wordes in Iohn 6. by Saint Augustine: yet wee finde this custome of giuing the Communion to the sicke, to haue beene at least two hundred yeares before Saint Augustines time. How proue yee now that the practice bred the opinion? yee coniecture it was so. A good and lawfull custome could no more haue bred it, then the truth of Christs words in Saint Iohn 6. The opinion, certaynly, was bred by some misse-construction, as yee say; and the way to remoue it is neither the deleting the wordes out of the Text, nor the discharging of a

lawfull and comfortable practice of Religion, but the right interpretation of the words of our Sauiour, and the clearing of the Churches custome.

                  They say, the sicke should not bee left destitute of comfort: This reason arises of the opinion of necessitie, as if there were no other meanes to comfort the sicke, or as if the comfort of the publike Communion endured onely for the present time, and not for the time to come.

                  The reason arises not of the opinion of necessitie, but of expediency: for albeit there bee other meanes to comfort the sicke, yet why should hee want this, that is one of the most powerfull, and ought to bee iterated as oft as it is expedient, although the comfort once thereby receiued endureth for euer?

                  In that place Saint Iames sets downe the meanes, whereby the sicke may bee restored to health, whilest the gift of healing was yet in the Church. The Sacrament was not any of these meanes, therefore of it no mention is made.

                  Some Diuines condescend thus far, that the Communion may be sent to the sick in the time of the publike action. But Tilenus sayes, Whatsoeuer necessitie be pretended, scarce any sufficient cause can be rendred, wherfore the publike action should passe in priuate, because the Ordinance of God is of supreme necessitie. The comforts of the infirme ministred out of order, does rather foster the publike infirmitie of the Church, then heale the priuate infirmitie of the sicke.

                     Beza in his Questions, thinkes that the Sacrament should be sent to the sicke. Caluine holds that it should bee celebrated at the sickmans bed-side, so both agree in this, that it should be giuen to the sicke. And Caluines saying, Epist. 363. may serue for an Answere to that, which yee alledge out of Tilenus: Quamuis nulla sit legitima coena nisi communis, quae tamen aegrotis dabitur, quia priuata non erit; adulterina non censebitur. Nam certe partem vel appendicem esse constat publicae actionis: that is, Albeit no Supper is lawfull but that which is common, yet that which is giuen to the sicke, because it shal not be priuate, is not to be counted vnlawful, for it is eyther a part, or a pendicle of the publike action.
                  To conclude, to deny a necessarie comfort vnto the sick, which may bee ministred without breach of any diuine order, cures not the publike infirmitie of the Church, but grieues the sicke, and fosters in these who are in health, a base opinion, and contempt of the Sacrament.
                  I will subioyne to all this Caluines iudgement touching these matters.
